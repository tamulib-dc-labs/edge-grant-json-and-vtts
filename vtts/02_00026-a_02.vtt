00:05.093 --> 00:09.500
You may recall that there was a tendency in part of freshmen to drown out an upper class one.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.623
And it was kind of strange.

00:11.663 --> 00:15.288
The upper class one didn't think you were a good freshman if you didn't try.

00:15.328 --> 00:19.595
They were proud of the fact that their freshman had some spirit.

00:20.155 --> 00:22.579
But if you did it, they'd kill you.

00:22.559 --> 00:24.462
Depending on who you did it to.

00:24.903 --> 00:32.756
And on one occasion, the upperclassmen sort of hinted pretty strongly that there was a certain sophomore that really needed it.

00:33.517 --> 00:36.121
It would make him a better person if we drowned him out.

00:36.161 --> 00:42.812
So being cooperative, a couple guys and I, actually one guy and I did it.

00:42.792 --> 00:54.565
And I'll never forget, the trick was you threw the water, locked the door with a certain device, a stick, and then you ran and jumped in bed and tried to act like you'd been there all night.

00:54.665 --> 01:00.031
Eventually, the lights come on, a big commotion, and the sophomores begin to check.

01:00.712 --> 01:07.399
And they'd come in and put their hand over your heart, and they could tell if you'd been running or check your feet if they were dirty and so forth.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.903
And I can remember the guy that did it.

01:09.923 --> 01:14.094
He put his hand on my heart and it was about to come out and he said, well, not this guy.

01:15.799 --> 01:18.425
And he was one of the co-conspirators.

01:18.626 --> 01:24.882
He was one of the people that had been hinting pretty strongly that we should drown out this other sophomore that none of them liked.

01:25.587 --> 01:33.862
And on occasion we would partner, like there'd be a sophomore in another outfit in another dorm that needed refreshments.

01:34.644 --> 01:39.834
And our first friends in that dorm would ask us to come over and do it.

01:40.595 --> 01:42.218
And this would occur at about what hour?

01:42.859 --> 01:44.502
Two, three in the morning, dead of night.

01:44.642 --> 01:46.566
And was it always water?

01:46.546 --> 01:51.776
always water, although there's stories that go around about other kinds of things.

01:53.319 --> 01:54.822
There was a peculiar culture.

01:54.862 --> 01:58.048
There was a line you didn't cross.

01:58.329 --> 01:59.651
You didn't really hurt people.

02:00.232 --> 02:09.330
You might do something and create great inconvenience to them, but if you did something just really truly mean-spirited, nobody supported that or appreciated that.

02:09.817 --> 02:13.103
And it was extraordinary when something like that happened.

02:13.123 --> 02:22.779
I think it was my sophomore year, a couple of chickens were locked up in a dorm room at the beginning of a Christmas holiday.

02:23.260 --> 02:29.310
And by the time the holiday was over, they had died and began to decay and it was just awful.

02:29.290 --> 02:40.032
That was something an old guy like me will remember, but that was highly unusual that somebody would do something that mean and vicious, mean to the animals plus mean to the individual.

02:40.533 --> 02:45.122
So there was something really extraordinary going on where somebody really had to be punished greatly.

02:45.490 --> 02:53.482
And no one put a horse or a cow or a sheep or a goat in anybody's room that you recall?

02:53.682 --> 02:58.009
Not during that time, but there, of course, in the history of the places you were there.

02:58.830 --> 03:10.468
Once the supposed culprit was discovered, what would then be the punishment in your era for

03:11.562 --> 03:14.949
It depended sort of on who the victim was.

03:14.969 --> 03:19.978
If it was somebody that was disliked, like the first example I gave you, the punishment was trivial.

03:20.039 --> 03:23.205
You might have to be campused one weekend.

03:23.285 --> 03:29.717
You might have to march in the bull ring or so forth.

03:29.878 --> 03:30.619
Something like that.

03:30.719 --> 03:32.102
If it was somebody that

03:32.082 --> 03:37.889
everybody liked, and it perceived to be that you had crossed the line, and it might be much greater.

03:38.089 --> 03:41.833
They might take a broom to you.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.615
They might do a whole variety of things to you.

03:44.456 --> 03:46.558
Describe the bull ring in your era.

03:47.459 --> 03:50.643
Well, this was the marching you had to do.

03:50.683 --> 03:54.467
You would get these rams or gigs for breaking various rules.

03:54.948 --> 03:56.029
It might be a uniform.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.334
It might miss a deadline, a curfew or something.

04:00.314 --> 04:04.359
And you had to march an hour for so many of these gigs.

04:05.340 --> 04:08.384
And that occurred typically on Saturday afternoon, like from one to five.

04:08.424 --> 04:15.794
You could, in principle, be out there marching in this huge square for anywhere from one to four hours on a Saturday afternoon.

04:15.974 --> 04:16.735
It was not fun.

04:17.476 --> 04:20.420
And you always prayed for rain, because if it rained, you had to study.

04:20.820 --> 04:24.505
And of course, we all needed to study, so it was a perfect thing.

04:25.246 --> 04:27.469
And the bull ring in those days was...

04:27.567 --> 04:30.394
It was out on the Duncan drill field in those days.

04:31.056 --> 04:42.624
And this was even though you said Saturday afternoon, so even if there might be a... No, it typically accumulated during football season, and after football season you had to march them off.

04:43.346 --> 04:44.108
That's my recollection.

04:44.645 --> 04:48.431
And what would be the most common offense that would lead?

04:48.592 --> 04:55.043
Something to do with dress, you know, not having your uniform on appropriately or shoes not polished right.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.286
And, you know, they weren't trivial things.

04:57.487 --> 04:59.009
It had to be a pattern of behavior.

04:59.089 --> 05:05.961
If you didn't speak to somebody, you know, maybe your room was over a period of time was not taken care of right.

05:06.683 --> 05:16.374
Of all of the freshman routine, which one was your least favorite that you thought was the most unnecessary?

05:16.414 --> 05:19.757
Having to get up for breakfast every morning.

05:20.038 --> 05:21.359
It's hard for me to even get up now.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.103
That was the part that I always thought was the worst.

05:25.183 --> 05:30.289
On those rare occasions, like on a weekend, like a Sunday, you could sleep in.

05:30.349 --> 05:31.130
That was heaven.

05:31.210 --> 05:33.012
That was the most wonderful thing in the world.

05:34.190 --> 05:40.236
And y'all weren't allowed to stay up late except on weekends?

05:40.256 --> 05:40.577
That's right.

05:40.597 --> 05:42.178
Now, you're supposed to go to bed.

05:42.278 --> 05:43.720
My recollection is about 10.30.

05:44.180 --> 05:48.685
You could get permission to stay later if you're cramming for a test or something.

05:48.705 --> 05:53.350
But the normal time out or time you go to sleep is about 10.30.

05:54.591 --> 05:56.513
Describe during your freshman year.

05:56.633 --> 06:00.417
Describe the routine of a home football Saturday.

06:01.898 --> 06:04.961
What time did you get up and what time did you all do whatever it was?

06:05.562 --> 06:07.845
Well, all the games were like Saturday afternoon then.

06:08.005 --> 06:11.169
So you got up and had the regular deal.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.052
I don't remember anything extraordinary.

06:14.072 --> 06:15.413
Obviously, there were people around.

06:15.453 --> 06:21.861
You had the radical thing of girls coming into the dormitory because they had open houses and stuff.

06:22.301 --> 06:23.923
So you had to get used to that.

06:23.903 --> 06:32.817
We marched in just as they do now, so you had to spend a lot of time getting your uniform ready and things.

06:32.837 --> 06:35.882
It was really after the game that you began to realize it was a weekend.

06:35.902 --> 06:37.464
If you had a date, you could go somewhere.

06:37.624 --> 06:39.988
If you didn't, you'd probably go out with your buddies somewhere.

06:40.154 --> 06:42.538
Did you all throw your leaders in the pond?

06:42.718 --> 06:44.340
Yeah, same deal when you won.

06:45.923 --> 06:48.186
Did you have some dates as a freshman?

06:48.547 --> 06:51.131
Yeah, sure.

06:51.211 --> 06:56.779
Where did a young man and his date go in those days, those nights?

06:56.759 --> 06:57.860
Not too many places.

06:58.702 --> 07:02.707
Sometimes you'd go to a movie, sneak into the drive-in theater or something like that.

07:03.868 --> 07:06.051
Sometimes you'd go to the clay pits.

07:08.114 --> 07:09.115
I guess they're still out there.

07:09.155 --> 07:10.657
Somebody told me they're still out there.

07:11.458 --> 07:12.640
Was Uncle Ed's still around?

07:12.880 --> 07:16.164
It was, but I've never really frequented Uncle Ed's.

07:16.184 --> 07:19.088
If I went there one time, I'd be surprised.

07:19.135 --> 07:24.262
Was there any place that was kind of other than Uncle Ed's that was on the fringe of being appropriate?

07:24.523 --> 07:24.903
Yeah.

07:25.725 --> 07:29.410
Out toward the airport, and frankly, I couldn't tell you the name of the place.

07:29.871 --> 07:32.995
Went there once or twice, but there just wasn't a lot of that stuff.

07:33.055 --> 07:35.018
You basically did private things.

07:35.058 --> 07:38.002
You might double date with somebody and go to a movie.

07:38.243 --> 07:48.197
You might go to a whiskey bridge and get something to drink, go out to the clay pits and just talk and drink beer or something, but...

07:48.667 --> 07:51.651
Would you all go downtown to the movie much?

07:51.671 --> 07:52.312
Very seldom.

07:52.593 --> 07:56.498
I knew there was one, and typically the better movies are here at Northgate.

07:56.979 --> 07:59.242
More commonly, we go to drive-in theaters.

07:59.262 --> 08:04.650
Now, I've never heard anyone mention a bootlegger in Brazos County.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.253
There may have been, but not in my world.

08:07.634 --> 08:14.143
I've never heard mention of one, nor any house of ill repute.

08:14.344 --> 08:16.086
Never heard that.

08:16.106 --> 08:16.767
No, no.

08:17.135 --> 08:23.851
When your date came down in your first year, where did she stay?

08:23.871 --> 08:25.475
A variety of places.

08:26.678 --> 08:33.253
There are places in town that accepted girls on weekends and stuff.

08:33.233 --> 08:45.405
My date was Sally, my wife, and she, by the time we were juniors and stuff, she had a friend that had married an Aggie and she'd stay with them and a whole variety of things.

08:45.605 --> 08:47.267
Sometimes she could get a room in the MSC.

08:48.388 --> 08:49.329
Oh, that's right.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.071
Now, was the Aggieland Inn still here then?

08:52.092 --> 08:55.255
Yeah, but best of my knowledge, she never got a room there.

08:56.156 --> 08:58.718
The MSC, she recalls staying there.

08:59.558 --> 09:03.462
Then on Sunday, would Aggies go to church much?

09:03.822 --> 09:04.443
Yeah.

09:04.603 --> 09:05.244
Where did you go?

09:05.825 --> 09:08.227
I didn't go very much, frankly.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.009
When Sally was with me, I'd go to church with her.

09:10.970 --> 09:13.112
She's a Catholic church.

09:13.252 --> 09:13.833
So you went to St.

09:13.853 --> 09:14.253
Mary's.

09:16.636 --> 09:27.287
Let's talk about the congregations and how much student involvement was there in the local congregations?

09:27.537 --> 09:31.726
I think there was quite a bit of the churches at Northgate because they were physically close.

09:33.049 --> 09:35.414
I confess I wasn't doing a lot of that.

09:35.455 --> 09:38.541
Were there some students that went on Sunday nights?

09:38.722 --> 09:39.925
Oh yeah, sure.

09:40.806 --> 09:46.018
Because Bob Walker told me that he found that the Church of Christ place was a good

09:45.998 --> 09:52.886
opportunity to escape hazing, and he'd go over there in the afternoons, and that's how he became very much.

09:52.906 --> 09:53.967
We all had our tricks.

09:53.987 --> 09:56.931
Some people went to the library to escape.

09:56.951 --> 10:06.883
I'll never forget Searsie Bracewell saying one of his first instructions from his upperclassmen was, do not go to the library.

10:07.103 --> 10:07.603
Very good.

10:07.684 --> 10:08.144
Very good.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.066
Let's see.

10:10.727 --> 10:14.892
Okay, now at the end of that freshman year, what did you do that summer?

10:14.872 --> 10:21.181
I had a job with a vinegar factory in Dallas.

10:22.083 --> 10:22.844
I was a veteran.

10:22.884 --> 10:26.749
I'd worked there the summer before, between my high school year and freshman year.

10:26.769 --> 10:28.913
It was a place called Consolidated Products.

10:28.933 --> 10:29.654
They made vinegar.

10:31.156 --> 10:32.678
So it had nothing to do with engineering.

10:32.894 --> 10:33.977
Well, not really.

10:34.278 --> 10:34.719
Not really.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.823
And I wasn't qualified.

10:35.863 --> 10:37.708
I drove a truck.

10:37.829 --> 10:40.236
It was an early version of an 18-wheeler.

10:40.276 --> 10:43.445
And I just did labor around the plant.

10:43.546 --> 10:46.735
Actually, only five or six people worked there.

10:47.170 --> 10:52.537
And do you remember what the cost was of a year at A&M in your student years?

10:52.557 --> 10:55.240
I think all the tuition was $50 for everything.

10:56.041 --> 10:58.404
And then there was a small amount for room and board and stuff.

10:58.424 --> 11:01.688
But probably if it was $500 for the year, I'd be surprised.

11:01.849 --> 11:03.310
I don't really know precisely.

11:03.331 --> 11:04.792
And your family paid that?

11:04.812 --> 11:05.093
Yeah.

11:05.113 --> 11:07.215
We were a situation where my dad paid everything.

11:07.235 --> 11:12.402
Did you know anybody that had anything like a student loan of any sort?

11:12.382 --> 11:14.685
No, I knew a lot of people that worked.

11:14.785 --> 11:16.027
A huge number of people that worked.

11:16.608 --> 11:19.151
The best jobs and the toughest jobs were waiters.

11:19.291 --> 11:27.943
But John Hagler, for example, he did not have the good fortune of having the kind of money necessary to go to college.

11:28.044 --> 11:30.687
He worked a huge amount his freshman and sophomore year.

11:30.948 --> 11:31.849
Where?

11:31.989 --> 11:32.770
He was a waiter.

11:32.885 --> 11:44.718
Because I certainly have interviewed many, many people, and most of those people are the most grateful because they perceive clearly what difference that made.

11:44.818 --> 11:59.555
There were small scholarship programs around and that kind of financial aid, but the idea of a federal loan and the kind of complex financial aid environment we have now, that was foreign.

12:00.496 --> 12:02.638
What was it like then to become a sophomore?

12:03.631 --> 12:04.292
Well, it was great.

12:04.793 --> 12:08.197
It was just like every other sophomore has ever happened.

12:08.297 --> 12:13.504
I was anxious to get back and enjoy the payback time.

12:13.984 --> 12:21.614
It never occurred to us that we really owed the juniors, the then juniors, the payback, but we took it out on the freshmen.

12:22.415 --> 12:22.876
It was good.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.139
Of course, academically, the place got tougher.

12:26.100 --> 12:33.570
The freshman year has its own kind of toughness, but I'm getting to the point where I'm taking the first set of engineering classes and stuff.

12:33.550 --> 12:35.876
I really had a huge load academically.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.480
Now this is the fall of 54?

12:38.482 --> 12:41.329
This is the fall of 55, my sophomore year.

12:42.532 --> 12:48.387
Did you have some favorite questions for fish, some favorite tasks?

12:49.295 --> 12:50.878
I'm sure I did, but nothing.

12:51.480 --> 12:58.374
I was more persistent in nagging than I was creative in my harassment.

12:58.414 --> 12:59.437
What did you nag them about?

12:59.497 --> 13:05.329
Oh, their dress, did they speak, did they keep their rooms right, and so forth.

13:05.309 --> 13:11.317
would work long and hard to help them correct their deficiencies.

13:12.820 --> 13:24.075
I've been told that by some old Aggies now that claimed I hazed them immersively when I was here, but I don't think of myself that way.

13:25.798 --> 13:29.443
The MSC

13:29.660 --> 13:31.642
was in full gear by that time.

13:31.662 --> 13:35.066
What role did it play in your student days?

13:35.286 --> 13:37.509
Well, it's a place to go study, get away.

13:38.410 --> 13:41.173
Some of the best food on campus was in the MSC.

13:42.434 --> 13:44.897
Occasionally, we got our nerve up.

13:45.498 --> 13:53.426
We were supposed to basically go to Dunkin' and provide meal service to the upperclassmen, but occasionally we'd get our nerve up and sneak out.

13:53.987 --> 13:57.591
We'd march to the door, and as the crowds were going in, we'd take off for the

13:57.571 --> 14:03.198
MSC and get a good hamburger or something and run the threat of getting in trouble for doing that.

14:03.819 --> 14:05.641
MSC was a haven.

14:05.661 --> 14:09.285
Did you have any contact with Wayne Stark as a student?

14:09.305 --> 14:11.528
I knew him, but I wasn't close to him.

14:12.389 --> 14:13.991
He was a friend in a sense.

14:14.151 --> 14:16.134
Everywhere he saw me, he knew me.

14:16.334 --> 14:20.639
This was mainly my junior and senior year, but I wasn't one of his guys.

14:20.799 --> 14:22.381
I didn't go to Harvard Business School.

14:22.461 --> 14:25.485
I was focused on my engineering career.

14:26.022 --> 14:30.268
Were you and other students aware of how he was drawing people in?

14:30.328 --> 14:31.850
Very much so, very much so.

14:31.870 --> 14:35.474
Of course, John Hagler was one of the people that he became close to.

14:35.515 --> 14:41.302
My recollection was that the two of them really became close toward the end of our senior year.

14:41.943 --> 14:44.086
I don't think John was thinking much about Harvard.

14:44.106 --> 14:49.012
He was planning a military career, but he did that a while, and then he went to Harvard.

14:49.113 --> 14:53.278
I think Stark is the guy that put the idea in his mind and got him thinking that thought.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.480
Do you have any idea how that relationship developed?

14:56.500 --> 14:58.385
How did Stark identify him?

14:58.525 --> 15:04.800
Well, of course, at that time, John was Corps commander, so he was already a student leader, and Stark knew who they were.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.163
That's how I got to know him.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.348
I didn't know him before I went on a Corps staff.

15:08.834 --> 15:23.213
Because as I understand from a number of people, and I almost saw it happen personally, a letter or a phone call from Wayne Stark to a certain person at the Harvard Business School could get a student in.

15:23.233 --> 15:24.374
Well, that was a perception.

15:24.495 --> 15:26.617
It may have been much more complicated than that.

15:26.637 --> 15:28.460
I think it was almost that simple.

15:29.181 --> 15:34.808
And apparently then those students upheld his judgment.

15:34.788 --> 15:42.140
Yeah, I don't know when it really started, but in my generation, there's just dozens of people that I know that went there.

15:43.222 --> 15:53.840
And what did you all think about the quality of the MSC as a structure and its opportunities?

15:54.461 --> 15:55.082
Oh, we loved it.

15:55.102 --> 16:00.711
I mean, we thought it was fantastic, of course, compared to where we lived and sort of a lot of the other stuff around it.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.034
It really stood out.

16:02.517 --> 16:04.186
Did you all think it was overdone?

16:04.226 --> 16:05.172
Oh, no.

16:05.192 --> 16:05.373
No.

16:05.413 --> 16:07.123
See, I've not run into anybody that

16:07.711 --> 16:18.984
I think when it was renovated when the 70s or something and the flag room was created, this perception that somehow we'd gone tacky or it was overdone came about.

16:19.004 --> 16:19.985
Well, not in those old days.

16:20.145 --> 16:20.525
That's right.

16:20.786 --> 16:26.812
It was very understated, almost a reverent kind of place.

16:27.093 --> 16:28.354
You didn't cut up there.

16:28.394 --> 16:29.355
You didn't make noise.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.137
It was definitely a memorial.

16:31.859 --> 16:42.426
I've heard legends about the discussion of the board whether or not to air condition it, but I never heard anybody complain about the fact that it was air conditioned.

16:43.030 --> 16:47.777
Guyon Hall, what role did it play in your room?

16:47.917 --> 16:49.759
Well, it was very important.

16:49.779 --> 16:51.902
Of course, there were movies there every Saturday night.

16:52.002 --> 16:53.945
It was a place you could go and watch a free movie.

16:53.965 --> 17:02.096
They weren't altogether the first-run premiere kinds of places, but it was really the only place to go and have a meeting.

17:02.757 --> 17:07.063
You know, if you wanted to get the Corps together or a large group of people together, it was really the only place.

17:07.634 --> 17:09.537
A lot of graduations were held there.

17:10.739 --> 17:15.728
The December graduation might be there, or the end of summer graduation might be there.

17:16.409 --> 17:19.775
So it was a place that it was used intensely.

17:20.597 --> 17:24.323
In fact, I think one of our biggest mistakes here was to take it down.

17:25.706 --> 17:29.372
If that were a question today, it would be seen as outrageous to even think about it.

17:30.095 --> 17:39.596
And as I understand, I don't know this for certain, but as I understand it, Dorsey McCrory forgot to call and notify the family.

17:39.656 --> 17:41.721
Mr. Rutter, I think, asked him to.

17:42.984 --> 17:47.614
And the guy and family learned of the demolition by seeing a picture in the Waco paper.

17:48.016 --> 17:49.540
I had not heard that.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.186
I hope that's not correct, but I've heard that indirectly.

17:53.169 --> 18:01.930
Like, I always argued, if nothing else, leave the columns as a symbol at this end of military war.

18:02.030 --> 18:03.093
I've had similar thoughts.

18:03.153 --> 18:03.915
If you...

18:03.895 --> 18:06.358
Look on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.642
You're walking the street.

18:08.662 --> 18:12.988
A lot of those storefronts look old like they've done for years and years.

18:13.028 --> 18:18.536
You back up 50 feet, and they're the facade on a big skyscraper.

18:18.656 --> 18:22.501
And there are ways to sort of preserve those kind of architectural elements.

18:23.182 --> 18:24.644
You know, it can't be brought back.

18:24.725 --> 18:28.330
I'm told that it took a lot of effort to get it down, get the building down.

18:28.350 --> 18:30.713
Yes, it was very well constructed.

18:30.693 --> 18:39.130
Describe what you recall about the Aggie response to movies.

18:39.190 --> 18:44.701
What kinds of noises did Aggies... I don't have great memories about that.

18:44.921 --> 18:48.368
I thought there used to be a lot of hoo-ahs and cheering.

18:48.408 --> 18:49.490
Well, there was.

18:49.631 --> 18:50.372
There was.

18:50.943 --> 18:54.829
I think the expression animal-like behavior was not unusual.

18:56.432 --> 18:57.834
I don't think that was unique to Aggies.

18:58.015 --> 18:59.758
It was guys.

18:59.778 --> 19:05.046
I've not heard of any allegation about obscenities being yelled.

19:05.066 --> 19:05.327
Oh, no.

19:05.387 --> 19:06.649
You just wouldn't do that.

19:08.873 --> 19:12.078
There really wasn't a lot of obscenities in your normal conversation.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.622
There were some, but nothing excessive.

19:15.293 --> 19:19.720
YMCA, what was it in your days?

19:20.401 --> 19:21.683
It was an office place.

19:22.024 --> 19:26.251
By the time I came, the bowling alley was over in MSC.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.558
YMCA was not a place that was a student gathering place.

19:31.179 --> 19:34.504
We knew its history and all that, but it was largely an office place.

19:34.544 --> 19:38.831
I think some of the dean of students and people like that were there.

19:40.293 --> 19:42.617
Did y'all call it the Quack Shack?

19:43.458 --> 19:45.631
Now, the quack shack was the old hospital.

19:45.651 --> 19:48.044
No, I mean, did y'all call the hospital the quack shack?

19:48.065 --> 19:48.507
Oh, no.

19:48.959 --> 19:50.621
I don't recall it that.

19:51.182 --> 19:52.164
I'm biased now.

19:52.204 --> 19:59.014
I know that's what the kids call the current one, but I do know that we had little regard for the quality of medical work.

19:59.815 --> 20:01.137
Was there a full-time doc?

20:01.317 --> 20:02.038
I don't think so.

20:02.058 --> 20:02.759
There was a nurse.

20:04.582 --> 20:15.979
What we would now understand to be a kind, gracious, elderly lady in those days, a vicious, mean old woman, but unfriendly and all that stuff.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.763
Did you ever have a minor injury that

20:18.743 --> 20:21.507
Only colds and things like that.

20:23.150 --> 20:26.254
This place in those days seemed to be the coldest place in North America.

20:26.935 --> 20:32.083
I think it was probably the uniform in the early hours and the fact you were tired most of the time.

20:32.284 --> 20:34.427
Everybody was catching colds, flu.

20:34.767 --> 20:38.633
During your four years, you didn't have to really go to the hospital.

20:38.653 --> 20:41.297
Nothing serious like that.

20:43.681 --> 20:47.687
Any life-changing events in your first couple years?

20:48.545 --> 20:49.334
Life-changing.

20:50.022 --> 20:51.822
Where something happened that you knowed.

20:52.814 --> 21:01.462
Yeah, the thing that comes to mind is, and I apologize, I don't remember his name, but one of my classmates was killed during the bonfire my freshman year.

21:02.643 --> 21:12.433
And he was, we used to guard the perimeter of the whole campus, and he was standing behind a truck or car or something, and somebody hit him and sandwiched him between them.

21:13.394 --> 21:19.940
And his name occurred in a lot of the discussions this year about bonfire, and I just don't really remember him.

21:20.020 --> 21:22.062
Bob Walker probably even remembers him.

21:22.042 --> 21:28.571
But he lived for a couple days, and the whole place was traumatized about what had happened to him.

21:28.591 --> 21:34.159
And it was after that they sort of pulled the guarding in closer into the campus and got it off the main streets.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.824
And that really affected everybody.

21:38.465 --> 21:44.153
I think probably there's still a monument out here on the Simpson drill field somewhere with his name on it.

21:44.173 --> 21:47.357
And bonfire your freshman year, what was your role?

21:47.945 --> 21:50.268
Well, we went to the cut area.

21:50.288 --> 21:51.129
We hauled logs.

21:51.209 --> 21:51.890
How far away?

21:51.910 --> 21:52.370
Do you remember?

21:53.392 --> 21:54.173
I couldn't tell you.

21:54.193 --> 21:56.916
It wasn't far, you know, five, ten miles or something like that.

21:57.877 --> 22:00.260
And, you know, there was no equipment.

22:00.921 --> 22:06.868
You physically lifted the logs with sticks, kind of parallel sticks and stuff.

22:06.888 --> 22:08.730
And there were trucks to bring them in.

22:09.892 --> 22:11.434
Backbreaking hard labor.

22:12.074 --> 22:13.076
The freshmen did it.

22:13.196 --> 22:15.178
The upperclassmen managed it.

22:15.839 --> 22:16.720
Who did the cutting?

22:17.037 --> 22:19.020
Seniors did the cutting, in my recollection.

22:19.281 --> 22:22.606
Seniors did the cutting, and freshmen did the lifting.

22:22.626 --> 22:23.448
Lifting stuff.

22:23.488 --> 22:27.514
Juniors would manage that, and their sophomores had to lift, too.

22:27.534 --> 22:29.818
Was the terminology already there?

22:30.119 --> 22:34.586
None of the red pot, brown pot, none of that was there.

22:34.606 --> 22:38.552
And the people that ran the bonfire were the yell leaders.

22:38.633 --> 22:40.255
The yell leaders built the bonfire.

22:40.355 --> 22:41.137
That was their job.

22:42.018 --> 22:43.180
And the bonfire was...

22:43.700 --> 22:46.824
Well, my freshman year it was out here in front of the MSC.

22:47.204 --> 22:49.567
Then they moved it to Duncan the last three years.

22:49.768 --> 22:53.152
Do you have any idea how long you worked on Bonfire as a freshman?

22:54.033 --> 22:54.814
Oh, quite a bit.

22:54.874 --> 23:03.565
Of course, you didn't start working until after the, all the work began on the Sunday after the football game, the next to last football game.

23:04.135 --> 23:09.861
Now, the following Saturday was an off week, so you'd work all that week and then the first few days the next week.

23:10.662 --> 23:13.285
And so the bonfire was put together in about 10 days.

23:14.226 --> 23:22.875
And that Sunday morning after the next-to-last game, all the core would be out cutting and stuff.

23:23.115 --> 23:24.777
And that was a big shock for freshmen.

23:24.877 --> 23:26.419
We didn't know what it was and all that stuff.

23:27.120 --> 23:34.007
But you worked all day long, essentially every free hour the next week.

23:33.987 --> 23:36.610
Right number of logs got out there, then they were stacked.

23:36.650 --> 23:37.831
You had to go out and help stack.

23:38.351 --> 23:41.194
But, you know, you can't get as many humans around that so far.

23:42.115 --> 23:45.278
And by and large, it was how many logs high?

23:45.959 --> 23:47.040
Oh, it was one log high.

23:47.080 --> 23:50.183
It was a TP, single stack TP kind of thing.

23:50.223 --> 23:52.085
And you can look at pictures.

23:52.105 --> 23:56.710
They're probably 25 to 30 feet tall, depending on the source of the logs and stuff.

23:56.730 --> 23:58.932
There was no stacks on top of stacks and stuff.

23:59.941 --> 24:04.248
And the enthusiasm was just as great then?

24:04.569 --> 24:06.152
Yeah, just as great.

24:06.172 --> 24:08.335
The crowds were just as into it.

24:09.097 --> 24:13.444
The atmospherics around it, the night it was burnt, were about the same, really the same.

24:15.207 --> 24:18.473
And editorially, I think it'll be the same this time.

24:20.616 --> 24:24.463
Because as a newcomer who did not expect to be at A&M very long,

24:25.118 --> 24:26.962
I remember going the first year we were here.

24:27.042 --> 24:29.307
We had a baby, and we brought him.

24:29.407 --> 24:33.455
He was not quite a year old, and I don't think we've missed many since then.

24:33.495 --> 24:36.502
Each one of our kids has watched bonfires from my shoulders.

24:38.045 --> 24:40.390
It was a community activity.

24:40.891 --> 24:42.975
So we thought...

24:42.955 --> 24:57.373
The football routine, did you become aware as a sophomore or later that there were any special courses for athletes?

24:57.433 --> 24:59.057
Were they supposedly taking...

24:59.695 --> 25:00.496
easy things?

25:01.678 --> 25:04.002
It was our perception that they took easy things.

25:04.042 --> 25:12.856
Of course, they lived in an athletic dorm and even though they were in the Corps, most of them, you know, they had certain freedoms about uniforms and so forth.

25:13.637 --> 25:17.603
I think probably we

25:17.954 --> 25:19.576
unfairly judged them in some way.

25:19.677 --> 25:24.704
I now know, for example, at John David Crow, he graduated in four years just like I did.

25:25.525 --> 25:29.230
A lot of those guys graduated probably more than everybody would ever expect.

25:29.451 --> 25:32.395
But the perception was in those days that they were taking easy programs.

25:32.415 --> 25:34.358
Where were the easy courses, supposedly?

25:34.378 --> 25:35.119
College of Business.

25:35.690 --> 25:36.571
College of Business?

25:36.591 --> 25:37.853
Yeah, College of Business.

25:37.873 --> 25:38.814
It wasn't a college then.

25:38.834 --> 25:40.116
It was a Department of Business.

25:40.657 --> 25:46.105
And quite unfairly, the perception was, you know, if you didn't make it in engineering, you went to business.

25:47.066 --> 25:49.990
And it's kind of interesting the way that's evolved over the years now.

25:50.030 --> 25:54.637
You know, business is seen as a rigorous, demanding program, which it is.

25:55.238 --> 25:59.304
Now, obviously, you engineers thought engineering was the most demanding.

25:59.844 --> 26:00.245
Of course.

26:00.425 --> 26:04.431
What else was there that you all thought that was almost...

26:04.867 --> 26:05.588
As demanding.

26:05.648 --> 26:06.329
What was next?

26:06.790 --> 26:09.815
In my mind, I think physics, something like that.

26:10.716 --> 26:12.539
All the basic sciences, chemistry.

26:12.599 --> 26:15.603
I hated chemistry, which for me would have been worse.

26:16.285 --> 26:28.343
I'm trying to think about other important A&M events.

26:28.846 --> 26:31.532
Did you go to Muster early on?

26:31.552 --> 26:32.535
Yeah, yeah.

26:32.555 --> 26:35.462
It was held, my recollection, it was held out in front of the MSA.

26:36.504 --> 26:38.028
And, yeah, we went to Muster.

26:38.369 --> 26:40.033
Did you know about Muster before you came?

26:40.153 --> 26:40.414
Oh, no.

26:41.476 --> 26:41.877
What did it?

26:42.430 --> 26:43.973
Did it make an impression on your heart?

26:44.073 --> 26:45.235
Yeah, of course.

26:45.596 --> 26:50.525
At that point, in the spring of my freshman year, I knew a lot about it and was into it.

26:50.685 --> 26:52.168
I learned about it.

26:52.288 --> 26:59.241
So it wasn't sort of the traumatic experience or the shocking experience the way that Silver Taps was.

27:00.250 --> 27:06.600
Interviewed a man last week named Edgar Patterson, who got here in the fall of 21 as a freshman.

27:07.141 --> 27:11.007
He's 97, still drives his own car in Houston.

27:11.227 --> 27:16.776
He's the oldest surviving band, he called himself band drum major.

27:17.658 --> 27:27.473
And he could not remember, when he was a student, he could not remember a muster or a bonfire or a silver taps.

27:27.858 --> 27:29.812
He did remember midnight yell practice.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.700
He could not remember the band playing The Spirit.

27:34.102 --> 27:38.326
when he was a student, but he did remember they were playing the war hymn.

27:38.346 --> 27:39.187
That was very much.

27:39.947 --> 27:46.994
And he said, now, my memory may have faded, but he said, I don't remember those events.

27:48.415 --> 27:53.880
And I thought some of our traditions, we may have extended them a few years.

27:58.624 --> 28:03.028
As you're going on up the ladder, sophomore and junior,

28:03.953 --> 28:09.558
What were the high-prestige student organizational activities?

28:09.898 --> 28:12.581
What did you all think of the Aggie band?

28:14.843 --> 28:16.404
We did not think much of the band.

28:16.624 --> 28:20.388
The band was always seen to be a little bit out of step with everybody else.

28:20.788 --> 28:27.033
If you could create trouble for the band, that was regarded as good because they would make trouble for you.

28:27.053 --> 28:33.319
I accuse them today of doing the following, which they certainly did then.

28:33.299 --> 28:34.901
reviews.

28:35.581 --> 28:38.965
The Corps is marching and then they grade them.

28:38.985 --> 28:43.030
They try to decide which unit looks the best, marches the best.

28:43.590 --> 28:45.352
Well, the band is always in that competition.

28:45.432 --> 28:50.798
So if a unit they're competing with is coming before the judges, they shift the cadence.

28:51.499 --> 28:53.581
And if you watch them now, they'll do it still.

28:53.601 --> 28:56.144
I accuse them of that, and they just giggle and deny it.

28:56.224 --> 28:58.686
But for generations, they've done stuff like that.

28:58.706 --> 29:01.990
They were always seen as a little bit weird, a little bit out of step.

29:01.970 --> 29:06.636
Interestingly now, though, they're a unit that's very accommodating to women, for example.

29:07.317 --> 29:12.704
So they're probably more in mainstream of what the Corps ought to be than most of them.

29:12.724 --> 29:13.886
What about senior debts?

29:14.266 --> 29:15.848
Were they around in those days?

29:15.928 --> 29:18.251
Definitely around and highly regarded.

29:19.693 --> 29:23.739
Enormous amount of time investment to be involved with them, just like there is today.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.083
Your leaders, were they...

29:27.653 --> 29:29.636
thought of as key students?

29:30.357 --> 29:34.644
They were respected and everything, but they were not thought of as strong academic students.

29:34.664 --> 29:39.752
They tend to be the good old boys and the great guys.

29:40.213 --> 29:42.657
It was a power position in a sense.

29:42.677 --> 29:47.905
It was a prestigious position, but you didn't win it by being a scholar and an academic.

29:47.945 --> 29:51.130
You won it by being tough, good old boy time.

29:51.110 --> 29:58.520
And the most respected, I think I know the answer to this one, the most respected student leadership position on the campus was... I was a court commander.

29:59.721 --> 30:02.104
And was there even a student body president?

30:02.144 --> 30:02.685
Oh, definitely.

30:02.765 --> 30:03.066
There was?

30:03.086 --> 30:03.646
There definitely was.

30:03.706 --> 30:07.211
And it wasn't a negative, but a lot of people wouldn't know who you were.

30:07.892 --> 30:09.814
What about senior class president?

30:09.854 --> 30:12.898
Yeah, there was... How did that compare to student body?

30:14.561 --> 30:16.503
Marginally better, but not significantly better.

30:16.844 --> 30:19.066
Court commander majorized all of them.

30:19.086 --> 30:21.049
Probably after court commander was head yelling at her.

30:22.801 --> 30:28.387
Did you know whether any secret fraternities existed in that era?

30:28.407 --> 30:37.637
There was talk about them, speculations, but there was never any kind of public or overt kind of thing.

30:37.838 --> 30:39.159
We all heard the stories.

30:39.179 --> 30:46.227
I think the last big event was sort of a few months before I came here, in the spring of 1954.

30:46.207 --> 30:49.390
Oh, is that when Dr. Harrington tried to crack down?

30:49.490 --> 30:52.473
Yeah, I think the TTs or something was the group.

30:53.034 --> 31:01.723
In fact, I think even some of them were football players, and there's some story that Bear Bryant had come for spring practice and lost some of his good football players.

31:01.743 --> 31:10.932
But that event was in the mythology of the place at the time, but there was no sign of the activity.
