00:02.225 --> 00:22.512
First, Mr. Ashton, tell us a little bit about your 
early life, including the names of your parents,

00:02.225 --> 00:22.512
the places and dates of their birth and death if you 
know them, the place and date of your birth, and

00:02.225 --> 00:22.512
schools you attended up to going to college. Well, 
I was born in Trouters, Rhode Island, October 17,

00:23.909 --> 00:34.046
1908, on Laurel Hill Avenue, which, to be honest 
about it, was a rather slum area. I don't remember

00:35.709 --> 00:42.901
my father and mother very well because they died 
when I was quite young, both of them within three

00:35.709 --> 00:42.901
months of each other with pneumonia. My father, 
incidentally, was an ice man. Now, that's an

00:46.748 --> 00:49.933
occupation that no longer exists. And I was stuck 
in an orphanage. And when I say an orphanage, I

00:55.269 --> 01:02.876
don't mean one likened to these that you have here 
in this beautiful state of Texas. This was a

01:02.896 --> 01:05.639
prison. It was one of these places run by charity. 
You were awful lucky if you had shoes that matched.

01:15.068 --> 01:17.490
We had secondhand toothbrushes and so forth. 
Well, I was taken out of there at the age of nine by

01:17.875 --> 01:26.665
two elderly people up in Massachusetts who didn't 
know what a hellion they were getting. They were

01:27.666 --> 01:29.969
very wonderful people. And I went to school in 
Massachusetts and finished high school in Medway

01:29.989 --> 01:35.155
High School. And I had already made up my mind. I was 
quite an athlete when I was a kid. I'd already made

01:41.983 --> 01:44.406
up my mind four or five years before I finished that 
I was going to Brown University in Providence,

01:45.128 --> 01:48.792
Rhode Island. My football coach, incidentally, 
was a Brown man. And with my high scholastic

01:52.416 --> 01:57.261
standing and his pull, I got into Brown. I stayed 
there a couple of years. And let me tell you, that

01:59.363 --> 02:02.667
place is prohibitive. Even in those days, I 
entered Brown in 1926. And it was one of the

02:06.191 --> 02:09.134
costliest schools in America then. I met a fellow 
there from Baylor.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.747
And he gave me a big line about Texas. I was about to 
run out of money. I had no folks, of course. And he

02:22.254 --> 02:24.578
kept chipping at me and chipping at me. And 
finally, I just hopped a train and I came down to

02:24.658 --> 02:29.767
Baylor. The man you met from Baylor, was he a Baylor 
graduate who was teaching at Brown? Yes, he was a

02:33.794 --> 02:35.417
Baylor graduate. And he was up there working on an 
advanced degree and teaching history at Brown

02:35.437 --> 02:40.465
University. Incidentally, the way we met, I 
worked for a detective agency working nights in

02:41.018 --> 02:48.209
Providence, Rhode Island. And I was out on the 
street all hours of the night, of course. And he did

02:54.137 --> 02:55.840
a lot of walking. He was very lonesome. And we had to 
wear these little brown hats with a white button.

03:00.567 --> 03:04.292
And so I bumped into him several times late at 
night. We struck up a little conversation. We

03:07.879 --> 03:11.603
became quite friendly and that's how I landed here 
in Texas in 1928. And he had a job for me at Baylor. I

03:16.667 --> 03:17.748
flourished at Baylor. I got a degree at Baylor. And 
then I went, I got a job, my first school job was

03:20.170 --> 03:25.835
coaching football. What was your major at Baylor? 
I double majored in English and History. Did you

03:30.279 --> 03:33.682
participate in any kind of sports while you were 
there? I was ineligible. I was quite a track man in

03:35.643 --> 03:40.190
the East, but I was ineligible as bailiff. I never 
could become eligible. You can today, now, after

03:41.652 --> 03:44.656
years of residence. I see. You were ineligible. 
But I worked with a track team there. I helped train

03:47.981 --> 03:51.787
the track team with Ralph Wilson. You were 
ineligible. Was that because you were an

03:53.089 --> 03:55.111
out-of-state resident? No, because I'd run at 
Brown. I see. I participated in another school,

03:57.515 --> 04:01.160
and therefore you were ineligible. That's right. 
for the rest of your college. That's right. You had

04:05.809 --> 04:07.191
been, what, two years at Brown? Yes. And then you 
did two years at Baylor. Yes.

04:12.018 --> 04:17.246
OK. Then you say you began as a high school coach 
after that. Where did you? Not only that, I was not

04:17.867 --> 04:23.776
only the high school coach, but I was the principal 
of the grammar school. Where was this? This was in

04:24.477 --> 04:26.019
Lorena, Texas. It's about 15 miles out of Waco on 
the way to Austin. For how long did you... Two

04:31.297 --> 04:32.639
years. Two years. And then where did you go? Then I 
went to Gorman, Texas as a football coach and

04:35.544 --> 04:41.555
principal of the elementary school. And that, 
thank the good Lord, is where I met my wife. Uh-huh.

04:47.545 --> 04:48.507
Now, that one year. And I wrote a little letter up to 
Massachusetts just for the fun of it. to my old

04:53.842 --> 05:02.893
superintendent and football coach, and he wrote 
back a little note with a contract in it that said,

04:53.842 --> 05:02.893
sign it, we need you up here to teach English. I 
signed it, I went up there, stayed a year, came

05:04.936 --> 05:11.304
back, married my wife, we went back, stayed 
another 10 years. And on the way down on that last

05:12.425 --> 05:18.453
year, I said to my wife, if I get a job in Texas, would 
you like to move back? Well, I'm not gonna tell you

05:18.513 --> 05:21.857
what she said, but she said yes. And I did. How did 
you happen to get the job at A&M? Well, that's a

05:29.517 --> 05:30.898
strange thing. I just happened to visit at Baylor. 
And the old fellow out there that I love very much, a

05:34.363 --> 05:39.430
fellow named Sparkman, Dr. Sparkman, wonderful 
old fellow. I dropped in there to pay him a little

05:39.490 --> 05:41.392
visit. He said, I knew he was in the state. He said, 
and I just sent a note down to A&M to Tommy Mayo and

05:43.816 --> 05:51.726
told him that you would be down there to be 
interviewed for a job. He said, they need some

05:54.079 --> 05:55.601
English teachers. And I told him, well, Sparky, 
I'll go. So I came down. And in five minutes, Tommy

06:03.189 --> 06:06.073
said, you're hired. And Tommy May was a wonderful 
fellow. So I have come to understand from a number

06:10.298 --> 06:17.806
of people who I've talked with who were students of 
his or talked with him or something. Wonderful

06:17.826 --> 06:18.507
fellow. And you joined the faculty then in 1946? 
That's right. As what, an instructor in English?

06:25.647 --> 06:27.931
Instructor in English, and I was out at the 
airfield. So you were in the basic division

06:28.572 --> 06:31.617
teaching? No, it wasn't called a basic then. That 
was the year when we had that big influx of

06:35.584 --> 06:45.220
veterans, and they were out at the old airfield out 
here west of On the way to power. Right. Okay. That

06:47.368 --> 06:48.009
was in 46. That was before the basic division was 
created. That's right. Who was out at the annex

06:51.053 --> 06:55.619
then? Well, there were six of us English teachers 
out there, and I don't remember. Some basic

06:59.824 --> 07:01.987
courses were taught out there. That's what you 
mean. Yes, yes. But the basic division is

07:03.870 --> 07:07.354
something entirely different than that. Now, we 
were teaching English 103 and 104 out there, six of

07:07.375 --> 07:12.101
us out there. And then they had, I think, math was 
out there. And I don't remember what else was out

07:14.967 --> 07:23.039
there, but I remember Tom Harrington was the 
coordinator or dean or whatever. We had a raft of

07:23.099 --> 07:25.462
fellows out there. But it was all freshmen out 
there? Yeah. Yes. Where did you live then? Well, I

07:30.670 --> 07:33.634
lived out there in one of those... barracks or 
whatever you call it, you know, the ones that

07:35.082 --> 07:38.847
fronted the highway. They weren't down where the 
students lived. I guess you'd call them officers'

07:41.631 --> 07:45.136
quarters, I presume. You had an apartment in one of 
the buildings then. Yes. Did all the faculty live

07:49.823 --> 07:53.529
in one or two of the buildings? Well, there were 
several of those long things, you know. Yes, we all

07:58.416 --> 08:00.018
lived out there. No, some of them lived way down, 
further down beyond where the students lived. We

08:06.301 --> 08:08.383
all lived out there at the annex. How long did you 
stay out at the annex then? I think it was a couple of

08:11.086 --> 08:17.453
years or a year and a half, and then Tommy called me 
into the main campus. You know, I'm not very good at

08:18.494 --> 08:20.076
dates. I can't remember really what happened last 
week, so I'm a little hazy on dates. Well, to a

08:25.502 --> 08:33.310
certain extent, specific dates are not that 
important. They're not important. When you came

08:36.288 --> 08:45.582
back, when you came to the main campus and after a 
couple years out of Gen X, did you continue to teach

08:36.288 --> 08:45.582
primarily freshman courses or did you have more 
upperclassmen at that point? No, it wasn't very

08:45.602 --> 08:52.413
long before Dr. Mayo gave me some upper class work 
to do, sophomore level work. And he called me in one

08:53.314 --> 09:03.730
day and asked me to teach 319, which is a report 
writing course and so forth and so on. So for quite a

09:03.710 --> 09:12.399
few years there I taught several levels.

09:12.419 --> 09:16.162
How did you become director or head of the Aggie 
Players? That's a strange question and it's a

09:16.182 --> 09:19.145
stranger answer. I don't know. I just... Tommy 
Mayo asked me if I'd take over the Aggie Players and

09:21.007 --> 09:28.335
I said yes. And that was it. Now you will explain 
that. Had you had any prior training, experience,

09:33.325 --> 09:43.158
or whatever in theater arts? Oh, yes. Up in 
Massachusetts when I was teaching there, I worked

09:44.340 --> 09:49.928
with a stock company for about 10 years. And I did a 
great deal of acting. I never had any courses in

09:55.837 --> 10:03.410
college or at the university level in any theater. 
I learned quite a bit working with this group

10:03.550 --> 10:10.743
because we had some very special people working. 
This was in Medway, Massachusetts. I worked with

10:12.546 --> 10:14.149
the Medway players. And I also became president of 
that for a couple of years. It was a stock company.

10:18.422 --> 10:20.324
We made some money, and we gave it away. You know, it 
was a non-profit thing. So you had had a good bit of

10:22.768 --> 10:24.550
practical experience. Oh, yes, I had a great deal 
of practical experience. What had been the past

10:27.133 --> 10:30.117
history of this organization? Well, it was very 
hazy. The Aggie Players itself has a name, came

10:36.539 --> 10:39.202
into existence in 1946. And prior to that, as I say, 
back to 1876, student organizations and faculty

10:41.024 --> 11:03.070
organizations on this campus had, under many 
different names, endeavored to put on shows,

10:41.024 --> 11:03.070
plays of all kinds and of all descriptions, none of 
which lasted very long. They were very

11:03.691 --> 11:05.134
short-lived. That is the organization. Yes. Can 
you tell us something about the creation of the

11:07.819 --> 11:15.493
Aggie Players in 1946? No. I wasn't interested in 
the Aggie Players in 1946. I was interested, but I

11:22.203 --> 11:28.290
don't know what went on because I didn't have 
anything to do with them. I didn't take them over

11:28.350 --> 11:30.212
until 1950. So you were off campus at the time they 
were created? No, I was on campus. Well, I mean, but

11:34.617 --> 11:36.359
you were out at the annex. No. Yes, yes, yes, a 
couple of years. Yes, yes. So then your first

11:41.445 --> 11:46.951
contact was in 50 when Dr. Mayo asked you to take it 
over. That's right. and uh what uh it was under

11:48.292 --> 12:02.554
student activities at that time so it was it was not 
under the english department it was uh not the

11:48.292 --> 12:02.554
aggie players no

11:48.292 --> 12:02.554
um There were two courses called English 381 and 
382 that had been created by whom I don't know. And

12:11.558 --> 12:17.485
one of them was called play production and the 
other one was called stagecraft. And just to be

12:17.505 --> 12:21.691
honest, they were not very good courses. They were 
not very good. Those had been in existence

12:23.493 --> 12:28.852
probably a couple of years when I took it over. And I 
was assigned those two courses. That was at the

12:31.722 --> 12:34.170
time you became director of the Aggie Players? 
Right, yeah. What was the makeup of the Aggie

12:36.352 --> 12:42.121
Players as an organization when you took them 
over? Well, as I told you, they all quit when I took

12:42.823 --> 12:46.088
it over. But, I mean, it had been just a kind of a 
student social organization that did put on play?

12:52.218 --> 12:53.620
Well, you used the word social. I didn't, but I'll 
abide by that. Well, in other words, it was a

12:56.184 --> 12:58.288
student organization. Right. whose purpose was 
to put on plays for entertainment. Right. It was

13:02.112 --> 13:05.756
not, say, a function of the English department. 
No. However, an English instructor was the

13:07.698 --> 13:16.968
director of the plays.

13:16.988 --> 13:23.495
Then you said you took it over and everybody who was 
a member quit. What did you do then? Well, I just

13:26.133 --> 13:31.138
issued a call in the battalion for a cast call to do 
the first show. And a few people showed up. Do you

13:33.961 --> 13:35.363
remember what your first show was? Yes, there they 
are, right there on the old wall. That's every show

13:38.406 --> 13:41.129
that I've ever done here, right there. The first 
show I did was Kind Lady. I forgot who wrote it

13:44.432 --> 13:51.239
now. Now... This may sound like kind of a silly 
question, but at the point you took over the Aggie

13:52.812 --> 14:05.649
Players, of course, it was almost entirely an 
all-male military school. And obviously, with a

14:06.350 --> 14:12.978
play like Kind Lady, you would have a female 
person. Where did you get your females to? There

14:17.344 --> 14:20.288
was never any problem in getting ladies to work 
with the Aggie players. We used secretaries, we

14:23.763 --> 14:32.160
used some faculty wives, we had people from town if 
they wanted to come out. Any lady in the community

14:32.541 --> 14:38.614
was eligible to join the Aggie players. We never 
had any problem in getting ladies. Even though it

14:42.766 --> 14:50.836
was a student organization, non-students quite 
regularly belonged to it. Over the years, I've had

14:50.856 --> 15:02.831
several wives of deans, and when Dr. Morgan was 
president, his wife was a member of the Aggie Place

14:50.856 --> 15:02.831
and worked in several plays. In fact, she's quite a 
brilliant woman. And she wrote quite a few plays,

15:06.218 --> 15:10.263
and I did one of her plays. And she acted in it for me, 
with me. She's a brilliant woman.

15:20.036 --> 15:27.286
What would you say would be some of your 
outstanding plays that you have done over the

15:20.036 --> 15:27.286
years? Most interesting, most difficult? Well, 
probably the two. would be Shakespeare's

15:34.197 --> 15:41.948
Macbeth, which, you know, one does not stir the 
bones of Shakespeare. But I studied that with

15:42.028 --> 15:49.659
another gentleman who is now not on the faculty, 
but a very brilliant man. And we did a great deal of

15:51.221 --> 15:56.829
study of witchcraft and of that particular 
period. And we changed it a little. Now, don't

15:58.932 --> 16:00.614
misunderstand me. I did not touch one single line 
of Shakespeare, but we did rearrange some scenes

16:03.442 --> 16:15.754
and we portrayed witches other than had been 
previously portrayed. And I prefer not to go into

16:15.794 --> 16:21.039
that now because I don't think you've got that kind 
of time. And the other show that I have a great

16:21.800 --> 16:33.111
liking for was Death of a Salesman, which I think is 
one of America's great plays of this century.

16:33.985 --> 16:36.527
That's just my personal opinion. But those two 
shows, oh, there are many shows that stick out in my

16:36.547 --> 16:41.392
mind that I've done. I've done Oedipus Rex. I like 
that, too, by Sarkozy. I did both versions. The

16:47.918 --> 16:50.421
one, you know, with the Greek costume. I did the 
modern version by Hanoi. Oh, I don't know. I'd hate

16:55.445 --> 16:57.948
to list the shows. Because I'm in this business, or 
I got into this business because I love two things.

17:03.061 --> 17:05.946
I love theater and I like my kids. I mean, my 
students. They're wonderful kids here at A&M.

17:08.972 --> 17:10.715
Now, don't you ever forget it. And that's why I 
stayed in the business. We've had our ups and downs

17:14.742 --> 17:17.947
and mostly downs. But it's been fun. And to me, it's 
been rewarding.

17:25.741 --> 17:26.723
So I wouldn't want to. pick out too many shows, but 
those in particular, I think that death of a

17:27.192 --> 17:38.423
salesman will eventually rate right up there with 
the top stuff that's been produced in America.

17:38.443 --> 17:40.044
That's a wonderful, wonderful show. You 
mentioned earlier that at the time you took over

17:41.866 --> 17:57.081
the Aggie Players, there were two courses in the 
English department having to do with theater

17:41.866 --> 17:57.081
arts, and you were named as the instructor at those 
at that time. To what extent has the theater arts

17:57.685 --> 18:02.472
section grown in the English department? Well, 
that's quite a story. The Texas Educational

18:04.315 --> 18:17.954
Theater Association was formed in 1950, and I was a 
charter member of that, and eventually I became

18:04.315 --> 18:17.954
president of it, two terms. I've been also 
secretary of it and held several other offices in

18:18.816 --> 18:22.721
it. It's an organization that includes all the uh 
not all but any of the university and college

18:24.466 --> 18:50.406
people in texas who are interested in promoting 
good theater in texas and we have a convention once

18:24.466 --> 18:50.406
a year i'm not going to go into that but that 
organization is primarily responsible for

18:24.466 --> 18:50.406
cataloging and making up different curricula 
that are now used throughout the colleges in

18:50.757 --> 18:54.485
Texas. And I had quite a hand in that. And that's 
where our six basic courses started in that

18:56.770 --> 19:02.402
organization. We had help from all of the members 
to make up these courses. And that's where they

19:06.080 --> 19:06.961
show. And of course, acting, scene design, 
directing, and playwriting, and so forth and so

19:06.981 --> 19:11.686
on. And we suggested that the colleges adopt 
those. And we've got all our syllabi on those

19:17.011 --> 19:20.455
things. And that's how it started. And right now, 
we've got 19 courses here that are offered at the

19:22.637 --> 19:28.863
university, accredited. And I'll have to say that 
I'm responsible for the general outline of all of

19:33.670 --> 19:38.178
these courses. And when I hired this young fellow, 
Wink, a few years ago, I turned over several

19:38.659 --> 19:48.896
courses to him on a technical level, and he's added 
and deleted quite a bit in there. So we have quite a

19:48.916 --> 19:54.406
bit of theater work that's offered today in the 
catalog. And I changed the thing from English to

19:55.067 --> 19:58.733
theater arts. But after all, most universities, 
they call it drama. Now, to me, the word drama means

20:04.670 --> 20:08.013
the play. That's all it means. And if I'm going to 
take a script and put it on in a building or out in a

20:09.755 --> 20:16.701
pasture somewhere, that is theater. That's 
theater. And so that's why. And then, of course, we

20:20.085 --> 20:25.530
added the word art to it. on general principles. So 
that's why I have, I name these courses theater

20:27.905 --> 20:32.089
arts. I don't think there's but one or two schools 
in the state that have any titles like that. Most of

20:38.076 --> 20:39.117
them are drama. Drama. And a good many of them are 
speech, and that's... Well, many of them have it as

20:39.958 --> 20:45.824
a separate speech and drama department, do they 
not? Yes. As opposed to being in the English

20:46.244 --> 20:48.046
department. Oh, yes, yes, yes, sure. Is A&M the 
only one that has it in the English department?

20:50.990 --> 20:54.133
Well, I'm not going to say they're the only one, but 
I think so. I'm going to say something. I don't know

20:57.480 --> 20:59.203
whether you want to delete this or not. Well, we'll 
leave that up to you. I'm going to say this, that for

21:03.009 --> 21:18.271
two years I have had on somebody's desk up there a 
complete program whereby A&M can offer a B.A.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.375
degree in theater. And it has been looked at and 
looked at favorably by TEA,

21:22.919 --> 21:30.828
and it hasn't happened yet.

21:33.632 --> 21:48.589
I'm not going to say any more now because, not that 
it makes any difference to you or me either, but we

21:33.632 --> 21:48.589
have all of the facilities here to offer a degree.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.180
So you didn't get that, I don't know. When you first 
took over the Aggie Players in 1950, what facility

21:53.540 --> 22:06.277
did you use for putting on your place? I just got 
through telling you, we had a leaky assembly hall.

22:11.463 --> 22:14.407
And I had six great big leak holes. You don't know 
what one of those is, but they were about this long,

22:14.427 --> 22:18.913
about this big round. And they were not very good. 
That's all we had. You called them what? The six

22:27.113 --> 22:29.019
things you had were called what? Lekos. 
L-E-K-O-S. That's a light. Light. Yes, it's a

22:32.909 --> 22:33.932
light. We had no equipment whatsoever. Nothing. 
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We had two or three

22:39.509 --> 22:47.567
cans of dried paint and probably a half a dozen 
flats that were old and beat up. We had absolutely

22:47.688 --> 22:49.933
nothing. Nothing. No money, no budget, no 
nothing. I'm not complaining. You asked me a

22:54.585 --> 22:57.189
question, and I'm telling you the truth, you see. 
That's what I'm asking for. Yeah. Okay, now, to get

22:59.051 --> 23:08.223
the perspective, you used the assembly hall, 
which was located approximately where All Faith

22:59.051 --> 23:08.223
Chapel is. That's right. How long did you continue 
to use that building? I can't remember, so help me,

23:11.768 --> 23:15.313
Hannah. I can't remember. Okay. For quite a while. 
Let's leave it that way. Well, let's say this way.

23:22.323 --> 23:28.334
If you can find out when they tore the thing down or 
when it fell down, that's when we moved out and we

23:22.323 --> 23:28.334
had to. Okay. When they tore that building down, 
where did you go? Guyon. Guyon. We didn't go to

23:35.406 --> 23:39.052
Guyon, no, permanently, though we fiddled 
around. We were in the basement of the MSC, and we

23:39.093 --> 23:42.799
were, you know, We were without a home, to tell you 
the truth. You see, at that time, they were still

23:46.344 --> 23:56.759
giving movies in Guyon Hall, beginning in the 
afternoon and running all afternoon and up into

23:46.344 --> 23:56.759
the night. This was a daily occurrence? Oh, yes. 
Yes, every day. Every day. So we didn't have, we had

24:01.595 --> 24:04.318
the basement. Eventually we had the basement. 
Then when they stopped giving movies over there,

24:05.520 --> 24:18.837
which date I don't remember, I was asked to take 
over the supervision, let's say, of Guyon Hall. So

24:18.857 --> 24:19.337
I did. And that became the home of the Aggie 
Players. And then we... created a fallout

24:25.996 --> 24:28.139
theater. And that was a theater whereby any 
student on this campus could write a play or could

24:28.159 --> 24:37.753
do a play in the basement for the public. And we'd 
give him any equipment that he needed. I mean, this

24:41.558 --> 24:42.660
was open anyway. We called it the fallout theater. 
And you see those little black books here? Those

24:47.226 --> 24:54.957
are all scripts of fallout theater productions 
done absolutely by students. No, they weren't all

24:55.493 --> 24:58.860
written by students. Some of them were. But they 
were directed, and the light plots, the acting,

25:00.444 --> 25:07.379
and everything else was done by students. With a 
little help from us, if they wanted a little help,

25:07.399 --> 25:12.330
we'd go in and help them out a little. And that's 
what the fallout theater was. Is that still in the

25:14.697 --> 25:16.920
business? Yes, but we don't really have a fallout 
shelter for them to operate in. We've done a few

25:22.387 --> 25:29.957
plays over at Forum there that we claim are fallout 
theater, but I don't like to... I didn't want to

25:29.977 --> 25:33.221
lose the name of the fallout theater. You see, we 
have the Aggie plays, we have the fallout theater,

25:34.263 --> 25:42.173
we have Children's Creative Dramatics, we have 
Children's Theater, and we have...

25:44.414 --> 25:45.415
the premium players. We have those five groups 
working within the structure of the theater arts

25:46.316 --> 25:53.926
section of the Department of English. And they've 
all been quite successful over the last few years.

26:00.115 --> 26:04.280
See, we run this Children's Creative Dramatics 
and the premium players in the summer. The

26:05.902 --> 26:10.548
Children's Creative Dramatics is run for the 
community of College Station. That's right, yes.

26:12.562 --> 26:17.107
I'm somewhat familiar with that because both of my 
sons participated briefly. Yes. But that is done

26:19.410 --> 26:22.554
by students primarily? No, no, no. I hire people to 
do that that have been trained by me or us in the area

26:24.176 --> 26:31.244
of Children's Trade in the Mass. I teach 
Children's Trade in the Mass. You teach it on

26:33.126 --> 26:33.807
campus? Yes. And then students who have been in 
that Well, they've got to have more than that

26:36.490 --> 26:39.558
before I'll hire them. Well, I mean, they have been 
in that. Oh, yes, yes. And then you hired them for

26:42.346 --> 26:45.233
the summer to... The lady that's been working 
downtown is... Been working down there, I don't

26:48.134 --> 26:53.161
know, five or six years, the same lady down there. 
And that's where the creating dramatics is for a

26:53.181 --> 26:57.527
specific age group, which goes up to what? Five to 
ten. Five to ten. Well, five to eleven, but we don't

26:59.289 --> 27:03.755
get many of those eleven, twelve-year-olds. And 
then the premier players are for older. Teeners

27:05.798 --> 27:11.205
from thirteen on, in high school, the high school 
kiddos, you see. And we do two plays a summer with

27:11.185 --> 27:13.390
them. Two full-length plays. And it's really a... 
I don't like the word workshop, but it's really a

27:17.461 --> 27:23.636
workshop in theater for teenagers here in the 
community. And who... is in charge of the premier

27:26.845 --> 27:28.608
players. Well, I've had my assistant in charge of 
the premier players the last several years, ever

27:28.668 --> 27:37.545
since I hired him, Bob Wink. And I believe one of 
your premier players productions is usually a

27:37.566 --> 27:41.513
melodrama. Yeah. Well, the last three or four 
years, yeah, we use a melodrama. Because they're

27:45.280 --> 27:48.767
fun, and it's a summertime type of production. 
Yeah. Yeah.

27:53.086 --> 28:01.075
What was the financial footing, financial basis, 
let's say, for the Aggie players when you took

27:53.086 --> 28:01.075
over? I just got through telling you. Well, we 
didn't get anything. Nothing. I believe you said

28:04.719 --> 28:07.623
before we turned on the tape they were in a $600 in 
debt. That's right. And they were in a student

28:09.325 --> 28:19.817
activity then, and I just went to the head fellow 
there who was Spike White, a nice guy, and I said,

28:09.325 --> 28:19.817
Spike, I'm not going to dig around for this $600. He 
said, all right, we'll just wipe it off. Tabula

28:21.819 --> 28:22.840
rasa. So he wiped it off and I started with nothing. 
So you had no money. No money. No equipment other

28:28.719 --> 28:31.182
than six flights. Yeah. And so you had to then, I 
suppose, do a good bit of scrounging at first. That

28:39.590 --> 28:42.973
is a beautiful word, and we've been doing it for 25 
years. Did you get any amount of money from the

28:44.234 --> 28:49.079
student services? Yes. Eventually, we got some 
money from the exchange store profit.

28:58.291 --> 29:04.559
They looked very favorably upon us, and they gave 
us, for quite a while, they gave us quite a bit of

28:58.291 --> 29:04.559
money. And then when we became a little bit more 
affluent, or not affluent, but a little more

29:04.639 --> 29:16.393
self-supporting, they sort of came down, down, 
down, down, which they should have. They were

29:16.453 --> 29:20.599
perfectly right in cutting their allowance to us. 
But that's the only one. Just recently, in the last

29:24.903 --> 29:33.115
three years, three or four years maybe, we have a 
small budget in the Department of English. And

29:34.276 --> 29:49.037
incidentally, there was a gentleman out in West 
Texas who has, for the last five years, been

29:34.276 --> 29:49.037
sending me, as a personal thing, I think, because 
his daughter was my secretary once, And he's a

29:49.507 --> 29:52.290
fairly affluent old gentleman. He even sent me 
$500 every year. And I've been using that for the

29:55.314 --> 30:01.481
premium players and the children's career 
dramatics. And I've been getting some money from

30:02.142 --> 30:06.608
the last several years. When I say I, I mean we. 
We've been getting some money in the last several

30:09.251 --> 30:14.417
years from the College Station Recreation 
Council. That would be for the premier players.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.971
And the children. Yes, right.
