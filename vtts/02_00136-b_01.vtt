WEBVTT

00:03.693 --> 00:25.855
22 years, do you recall much statistical

00:03.693 --> 00:25.855
similarity between those who were admitted with 
high scores, well, with their admission

00:03.693 --> 00:25.855
criterion and status, and their performance at 
A&M?

00:29.138 --> 00:30.780
I think we'd have to go into the measurement and 
research services to figure out. I do think I

00:35.908 --> 00:48.304
recall that those who were admitted with the best 
academic and test scores probably came out better

00:35.908 --> 00:48.304
as far as the grade point average is concerned.

00:52.350 --> 00:59.940
Many of them who were admitted with not as strong an 
academic record probably had to work harder at it

01:00.595 --> 01:02.297
and probably graduated. We still, we hear the 
tale, though, that

01:03.859 --> 01:29.252
as far as successful graduates, oftentimes those 
who graduated with the highest grade point

01:03.859 --> 01:29.252
average, they go more into research and writings 
and things like this, where those with a somewhat

01:03.859 --> 01:29.252
lesser, although not necessarily the bottom, but 
they perform more of the managerial functions and

01:03.859 --> 01:29.252
more of the day-to-day operations and most many of 
the ones are very successful financially have

01:29.587 --> 01:49.418
been those who have learned to work hard while they 
were going to school I think all right let's make

01:29.587 --> 01:49.418
believe now that we have hired you as a consultant 
to Texas A&M to advise them about admissions

01:50.495 --> 02:16.350
process and criterion based on your experience 
what would you advise them what process would you

01:50.495 --> 02:16.350
advise and what factors would you advise them to 
consider

01:50.495 --> 02:16.350
well i would have to assume first if you're going to 
do something like this that you've probably got a

01:50.495 --> 02:16.350
limited number of freshmen that you would want to 
enroll and of course what you want to do is get those

01:50.495 --> 02:16.350
who you think would be the most successful or most 
likely to complete the curriculum in probably

02:17.360 --> 02:26.933
prescribed, quote, four-year time?

02:32.941 --> 02:38.228
I think you've got to have some basic things which 
you want to look at. I think that the academic

02:38.268 --> 02:46.860
performance of the student is certainly probably 
the best criteria that you'd want to, that we have.

02:47.380 --> 02:54.916
In addition to this, scores which they make on 
standardized tests are useful in making your

02:47.380 --> 02:54.916
prediction. I think you would also want to look at 
the type of activities a student participated in

02:57.081 --> 03:05.018
in high school. whether it be in athletics or 
whether it be in student government, whether it be

03:05.521 --> 03:29.200
in the arts such as the band or orchestra, whether 
they had extracurricular activities within the

03:05.521 --> 03:29.200
community, whether they belong to certain type of 
church organizations, all these kinds of

03:05.521 --> 03:29.200
participation.

03:33.128 --> 03:41.919
Sometimes their ethnic background may give you a 
key as to why they did or did not perform as well as

03:33.128 --> 03:41.919
they did. I think it boils down to if you really want 
to

03:43.401 --> 04:02.865
select those students who may be best able to 
profit by the education, that you're going to have

03:43.401 --> 04:02.865
to do a review, an individual review. I don't think 
you can do it just on giving weighted points to

04:05.647 --> 04:15.321
various and certain aspects of the thing. If you 
can throw in an interview I think it's even better.

04:19.647 --> 04:26.557
Who should be present at that interview other than 
the prospective student? It would probably be

04:26.577 --> 04:31.705
better if an admissions counselor, the person 
who's dealing with and used to dealing with the

04:33.524 --> 04:43.205
admissions, and possibly some other person from 
maybe an academic area might be. What about from

04:43.465 --> 04:45.529
the student's family? Anybody? Sometimes the 
students prefer to talk without parents there.

04:53.804 --> 04:55.226
Are you saying it's better without the parents? I 
think it's probably better without the parents,

04:55.246 --> 04:57.949
for the most part. Sometimes an interview with the 
parents without the student gives you some

04:59.611 --> 05:03.876
insight, too. Again, we're talking about how much 
time you're able to spend in the selection

05:04.597 --> 05:09.903
process. And the more time you can spend up to a 
certain point, probably the better job you can do.

05:15.850 --> 05:20.355
I think part of the concern which we've always felt 
was that many of our decisions had to be made in a

05:20.740 --> 05:35.214
very quick time because of the number of students 
we were dealing with, the fact that all students

05:20.740 --> 05:35.214
couldn't get in for interviews, and these kinds of 
things. And it sometimes gave me concern that we

05:35.294 --> 05:49.228
just didn't have as much data as we'd like to have, 
and we're doing it on the, that we obviously, we may

05:35.294 --> 05:49.228
be overlooking some factors in a student's life 
that might be very beneficial in making the

05:49.580 --> 05:56.068
selection. Which is more important, the score in 
the verbal or the mathematical? Statistically,

06:02.976 --> 06:06.280
the verbal score is more important. And the 
selection

06:06.501 --> 06:15.992
criteria they used to use for the National Merit 
Scholars was weighted that way, I think, too. Is

06:16.917 --> 06:23.444
there anything in this perfect setting for 
admissions review? Should there be anything that

06:24.224 --> 06:30.471
the student submits other than transcript, an 
essay, or anything else? Well, an essay would

06:31.111 --> 06:38.899
allow them to give

06:31.111 --> 06:38.899
you some additional information about them. It 
also gives you a chance to make some kind of a

06:38.979 --> 06:46.907
judgment as to their writing abilities and these 
kind of things, which are going to be important

06:38.979 --> 06:46.907
when they get to the university. Right. And in this 
perfect admissions process, there would be an

06:49.635 --> 06:57.103
appeals opportunity or not? We did have here, and I 
would always like to have an appeals process,

06:58.264 --> 07:03.249
yeah. Because it gives those people, first place, 
I think, if they're really interested, they may

07:03.309 --> 07:13.760
make more of an effort in an appeal. Who would be on 
the appeals panel? Oh, I'd probably want at least

07:17.330 --> 07:19.776
three different people. One an admissions 
person, probably somebody from outside the

07:19.856 --> 07:34.933
admissions office might look at it from a, just a, 
from the process, From a time standpoint, it's

07:36.230 --> 07:53.090
sometimes a whole lot easier to have three 
different people from the admissions area look at

07:36.230 --> 07:53.090
it, although I think, again, sometimes somebody 
from outside the office may have a different set of

07:36.230 --> 07:53.090
glasses to look at than we might have. We may 
sometimes get too focused in what we're looking

07:53.170 --> 07:56.213
at. All right. Now, again, relying on your 
experience, based on your experience, do you

07:58.776 --> 08:05.224
think A&M... changed his admission requirements 
at about the right time and with about the same

08:06.065 --> 08:17.036
amount of restriction that they should have? 
Well, I can remember back in the early 70s when Dr.

08:19.238 --> 08:28.487
Williams was here at a meeting one time, he made a 
comment that he thought 20,000 would be a nice size

08:19.238 --> 08:28.487
university. And I certainly agreed with him as far 
as that's concerned. However, we, because of our

08:33.352 --> 08:36.916
popularity, I guess you'd say, we never even 
slowed down to 20,000. I think that we probably

08:38.277 --> 08:49.368
started limiting the enrollment,

08:38.277 --> 08:49.368
it's hard to say, maybe a little bit late. I don't 
know what the proper figure should be. From a

08:53.633 --> 09:02.582
financial standpoint, looking at it from a tax 
base standpoint, I think that the people in Texas

09:02.748 --> 09:08.840
have a right to expect the best from their 
educational institutions. There are

09:09.461 --> 09:17.977
institutions in the state which I am told could 
probably handle more students at a lower cost. And

09:18.719 --> 09:23.187
while this may say, well, you're being elitist, 
maybe, I think that there are some schools that can

09:23.656 --> 09:43.442
do a very good job of educating students at a 
bachelor's level, which would allow more

09:23.656 --> 09:43.442
resources at the master's and doctor's level for 
some of the larger universities to fill that gap on

09:23.656 --> 09:43.442
the thing, where if they've got to spend the money 
educating more undergraduates, then there's

09:23.656 --> 09:43.442
less at other levels. It's a matter of economics, I 
think. Obviously, being an Aggie, I would think

09:46.126 --> 09:51.773
everybody ought to be an Aggie, but the university

09:53.980 --> 10:03.512
From a personal standpoint, I think it has gotten 
so large that it's hard to have the personal

09:53.980 --> 10:03.512
interest in the students that you have when the 
enrollment is not quite as large.

10:06.936 --> 10:10.260
Let's go back chronologically now. Dr. Williams, 
the president, Calhoun, the vice president, in

10:11.421 --> 10:23.616
the 70s, and did they... interfere with 
admissions? Did they nitpick? Or did you feel you

10:31.163 --> 10:41.418
had pretty clear understanding of what you all 
were to do, and you seldom, if ever, got anything

10:31.163 --> 10:41.418
overruled? I don't recall that they ever quote, 
overruled us in that sense. They sometimes ask us

10:49.496 --> 11:03.257
to make admissions where the student had not met 
the stated criteria, but because of other factors

10:49.496 --> 11:03.257
they felt like the student might have a chance to be 
successful, I think. About how often? Very

11:04.218 --> 11:05.000
seldom. Once a year? I would say probably twice or 
three times a year, but again, just wild guess. All

11:12.550 --> 11:21.179
right, then in 1976, Dr. Miller becomes the 
president, and Dr. Williams moves up to be

11:12.550 --> 11:21.179
chancellor. Were there any changes in the process 
then? Not really. I think by that time, and again,

11:27.245 --> 11:34.352
as I recall, we were probably getting more 
crowded. We were probably getting more requests

11:34.552 --> 11:38.456
to make exceptions, I think. I think that we had... 
More requests from possibly board members which

11:40.462 --> 11:48.173
were receiving input from people who lived and 
knew them and this kind of thing. So I think it

11:48.514 --> 11:59.550
probably as time went on, as we raised the 
requirements some, as we had more students

11:48.514 --> 11:59.550
wanting to get in, I think we probably had more 
appeals. And we probably made a few more

12:00.492 --> 12:05.720
exceptions at that time than we did other times. Do 
you remember any that were bothersome?

12:12.895 --> 12:34.647
To be honest, I think most times when certain board 
members got involved, it became bothersome

12:12.895 --> 12:34.647
because they

12:12.895 --> 12:34.647
seldom, as I recall, asked to see if it were in a 
student's interest to be admitted. I think they

12:34.887 --> 12:39.194
were more concerned about getting a student 
admitted. That's looking back at it. If the board

12:40.283 --> 12:47.213
member wanted it done, whom did the board member 
normally contact here?

12:49.957 --> 12:57.428
We had a few board members who would call Ed or I one 
direct. For the most part, president and I don't

12:59.335 --> 13:22.980
know that Dr. Vandiver or Dr. Miller set it up for 
that they would come through the board secretary

12:59.335 --> 13:22.980
so we had some kind of control over it and then that 
queries either to my office or to the president's

12:59.335 --> 13:22.980
office so getting getting the board not calling 
directly but at least through the board secretary

12:59.335 --> 13:22.980
and then At some time, then that board secretary 
was directed to the president's office or to the

13:24.698 --> 13:37.416
vice president, Dr. Prescott, or to you or to 
someone else. Now, when were those

13:37.876 --> 13:42.122
communications normally oral or in writing? Not 
in the oral. Were you at the commencement in the

13:44.706 --> 13:52.957
spring of 1980 when Dr. Miller did not shake hands 
with a graduate? Yes. Okay. Describe, as you

13:54.500 --> 14:00.769
recall, what happened at the end of that. Because 
she's the last degree recipient at the last of

14:01.190 --> 14:11.044
three commencements, Friday afternoon, Friday 
night, Saturday morning. Because her name began

14:11.064 --> 14:22.861
with Z, and you graduate alphabetically by 
college and by major, and she was in biomedical

14:11.064 --> 14:22.861
science and veterinary medicine. Her name was 
Melanie Zintgraff. Describe, as you recall, what

14:24.824 --> 14:28.249
happened. Well, the only, by that time, we had 
looked at several hundred students coming across

14:28.269 --> 14:38.242
the state and shaking hands and getting their 
diploma and everything. And the only thing I

14:38.843 --> 14:47.074
remember about it, ask her, was the fact that when 
she got her diploma, he didn't shake her hand,

14:38.843 --> 14:47.074
which I thought was strange at the time. Were you up 
where you could see what happened? Yeah, at each of

14:52.212 --> 15:20.295
the Commencements, as you may recall, I was one of 
the, we led the faculty in, and I was always sitting

14:52.212 --> 15:20.295
on the stage because at that time, we were not 
handing out hoods at that time, they were carrying

14:52.212 --> 15:20.295
hoods, but anyway, I was always sitting on the 
stage because I had been leading the faculty in, so

14:52.212 --> 15:20.295
I was sitting on the stage and glanced over I 
usually would watch them as they got their

15:21.237 --> 15:24.402
diplomas. I do recall that he did check her hands. 
All right. As I recall, as dean of faculties, I

15:28.187 --> 15:36.359
would carry the mace, put it in the holder, go to the 
back of the stage. Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby

15:38.201 --> 15:40.725
was our commencement speaker. And while they're 
passing out diplomas, he motioned for me to come up

15:42.107 --> 15:46.013
and sit near him. And we were talking about my going 
out to UTEP to be the president. And as I realized we

15:50.802 --> 15:57.608
were about to finish, I started to get out of my 
chair, and I heard some hissing, particularly

15:50.802 --> 15:57.608
from corps members. And he asked, what is that all 
about? And I said, well, they're unhappy about

16:00.992 --> 16:03.434
something. And I looked around, and then I 
recognized who it was. He, too, recognized the

16:07.338 --> 16:11.742
name because he said that she had been a problem for 
him. She'd been over to him complaining about her

16:12.382 --> 16:18.548
not being able to be in the band, the official drill 
team and the Ross volunteers

16:18.713 --> 16:48.265
and being the last one and hearing the hissing 
everybody in the audience was kind of looking at

16:18.713 --> 16:48.265
the stage and getting their notes together and 
everything so there's more attention and as I

16:18.713 --> 16:48.265
recall she took the diploma with her right hand by 
error moved it to her left and then put out her hand

16:18.713 --> 16:48.265
and Dr. Miller said something to her about not 
shaking her hand, and she turned to Lacey and said

16:48.565 --> 17:03.464
something to him, and he said something polite to 
her, and as I recall, Don Carter said something

16:48.565 --> 17:03.464
like, ma'am, would you keep the line moving? All 
right, did you hear anybody after this on the stage

17:03.484 --> 17:14.098
or in the Letterman's Lounge offer any comment 
about what had happened? I don't recall any

17:14.438 --> 17:16.801
comments about the thing. No, that's... It's a 
long path. I don't remember. I do remember the fact

17:20.350 --> 17:26.198
that he didn't shake her hand, but that's really 
all I remember about him. I think I remember a

17:26.218 --> 17:33.867
couple of board members saying, serves her right, 
you know, and I wouldn't have shaken her hand

17:26.218 --> 17:33.867
either. All right. When did you hear that Dr. 
Miller's term as president had been ended? And how

17:45.097 --> 17:46.439
did you hear about it? Do you remember? Don't 
recall. Okay. Right. Then the new interim

17:51.084 --> 17:59.314
president from engineering,

17:51.084 --> 17:59.314
were there any changes for y'all? No. Okay. Things 
went right on. All right. Then in 81, Dr. Vandiver

18:03.419 --> 18:05.882
becomes president. Any changes there? And I say no 
changes. What year? 81. No, there wasn't any

18:12.430 --> 18:14.192
changes then. Okay. And then go on forward. Well, 
as all I recall, as we go on forward, we get tighter

18:18.133 --> 18:24.383
and tighter as far as numbers are concerned. And 
then they begin to talk about limiting enrollment

18:25.044 --> 18:30.893
and those kinds of things. All right. As the 
limitation becomes tighter, do the number of

18:31.795 --> 18:38.105
appeals increase? Oh, yeah, I think so. Mm-hmm. 
And did y'all make more exceptions for

18:41.307 --> 18:46.177
admissions?

18:49.844 --> 18:53.933
Or was the number still pretty small? I really 
don't remember about the numbers that we made.

18:59.178 --> 19:06.969
What we, again, what we went through as we began to 
get tighter and tighter, we went to this process of

18:59.178 --> 19:06.969
changing the admission requirements. And then at 
that time, the automatics and the review, and of

19:07.831 --> 19:25.236
course the review, we put the number of reviews in 
that we thought would give us, we had basically, we

19:07.831 --> 19:25.236
were running somewhere around 63% or something 
like that, so we had made it about 10,000. If you

19:25.874 --> 19:32.504
admit about 10,000, you can expect 63,000, 6,000, 
somewhere in there to show up on the thing. Did that

19:32.825 --> 19:34.988
change through the years much? As far as I know, 
when I left, we were still trying for 6,000, and I

19:35.749 --> 19:44.503
think they're still keeping that 6,000 figure. 
But that 63%? Yeah, it

19:45.584 --> 19:50.351
kept eating up. The show-up rate did? Well, the

19:53.819 --> 20:06.216
show rate varied. We put around 62 to 63 or 64 
percent. So we kind of worked it around that is the

20:09.820 --> 20:14.146
number that we would admit. As far as you know, was 
that very unusual, that percentage? compared to

20:19.739 --> 20:23.998
Austin or other selective public universities?

20:27.573 --> 20:27.995
I don't know. I don't have it prepared. it's 
probably unusual to a lot of the universities

20:30.202 --> 20:55.180
because they just it's students either they know 
more where they're going to go all right but of

20:30.202 --> 20:55.180
course we had a lot of students that would apply to a 
m to texas and texas tech and you know they get

20:30.202 --> 20:55.180
admitted to all three and then they decide where 
they want to go based on whatever factors students

20:30.202 --> 20:55.180
decide on but We probably did have more appeals, 
because we let them do written appeals, too. We had

21:00.709 --> 21:10.000
hundreds of written appeals, which we would read 
through and try to make a decision as to whether we

21:00.709 --> 21:10.000
thought they were married here and making an 
exception or not. The review process, it was

21:11.301 --> 21:21.673
fairly easy to take a good number in the review, and 
then we got tighter and tighter as we got near this

21:11.301 --> 21:21.673
maximum number that we wanted to admit. Back to 
this perfect admissions process we were talking

21:22.244 --> 21:27.173
about a while ago. What part, if any, in the review 
of a marginal student, what part, if any, should it

21:27.954 --> 21:42.681
play if this is the child of an A&M graduate? We 
factored in a very We were using a number on a review

21:47.303 --> 21:49.625
process. So that would be a plus? It was a plus, 
yeah. It was a plus. What if they lived out of state

21:53.169 --> 22:00.396
but were still an A&M graduate child? As I recall, 
we were, as far as the admission process was

22:01.377 --> 22:14.830
concerned, we were treating the out-of-state son 
or daughter of a former student the same as we would

22:01.377 --> 22:14.830
if they were in-state. That may be wrong, but 
that's the way I recall we were doing it. All right.

22:18.946 --> 22:31.136
Then for admission, pure and simple, was it easier 
for a Texas resident to be admitted than an

22:18.946 --> 22:31.136
out-of-stater?

22:31.156 --> 22:31.256
Yeah. Did you all have a kind of a percentage in mind 
of what percentage of out-of-staters you would

22:31.276 --> 22:39.183
admit? Not really. And again, as I recall...

22:47.345 --> 22:50.850
The figure ran maybe around somewhere around 10%, 
but I may be wrong on that. The percentage of

22:51.531 --> 22:58.240
freshmen that entered were, you know, they were 
predominantly Texans. And I don't know whether

22:58.520 --> 23:05.189
that figure was 85% or what it was, but it was high. 
All right. But did I have to admit, if I'm an

23:05.429 --> 23:14.061
Oklahoman, did I have to have a slightly higher 
quality performance in high school and test

23:14.952 --> 23:20.299
scores than if I lived in Dallas. Seemed like we 
did. Any unusual difficulties with

23:24.324 --> 23:30.712
international admissions? We handled those 
separately and we set kind of a level on those that

23:31.452 --> 23:36.879
we would admit. We didn't get a whole lot of 
applications from undergraduates. Most of our

23:41.625 --> 23:44.048
international students were graduate students. 
All right, now, through the calendar year, take me

23:44.517 --> 23:54.835
through the calendar year as to what the work 
schedule was for y'all, because there must have

23:44.517 --> 23:54.835
been a heavier workload at some parts of the year 
than others. Let me go back to one thing on the

23:55.195 --> 23:57.459
international students. We tried to get a 
representative base from that so that we didn't

24:01.797 --> 24:06.882
get everybody from Mexico, everybody from 
Canada, what have you. So we did try with the

24:06.902 --> 24:12.468
numbers there and we had exceptions to make 
possible. We might be more willing to make an

24:12.488 --> 24:21.158
exception from a country who had a smaller student 
population from that. Workload, of course the

24:21.418 --> 24:26.944
workload really starts in the fall whenever they 
started going and making high school visits. When

24:31.934 --> 24:37.920
we first started, we did the high school visits 
from the admissions office. In fact, Gale Wood was

24:38.521 --> 24:43.527
the man to make it, and we used faculty members. I 
remember Roger Feldman used to work with us quite a

24:43.547 --> 24:46.230
bit on it. And we had other faculty members that we 
would call on to make a night here, a night there,

24:46.690 --> 24:52.837
when Gale just had so many. Because sometimes we'd 
have two and three a night, and he couldn't make

24:52.857 --> 24:56.121
them all. I would make a lot of them as well. And then 
we got to the point where we had,

24:59.324 --> 25:10.655
and then we started hiring admissions 
counselors. We developed an admissions

25:10.916 --> 25:18.423
counselor section, I think, in which we had people 
who only did that kind of work, which took the work

25:10.916 --> 25:18.423
off again. This was in the mid-'80s, I guess. He did 
it for a number of years all by himself, frankly.

25:23.337 --> 25:26.421
Anyway, the workload starts in the fall. When you 
start making a high school college night, we start

25:26.541 --> 25:32.330
putting out applications and they start coming 
in. And eventually we put a deadline on

25:32.350 --> 25:41.422
applications when they had to be in to be 
considered for the following year. And I think

25:41.462 --> 25:46.670
that it's March 1st, but I may be wrong on that. 
Again, going back when I first came, we were taking

25:47.210 --> 25:50.475
applications in August. admitting students, and 
students were enrolling in September. Then we

25:54.371 --> 26:05.545
moved it up to about October, excuse me, we moved it 
to first of June, something like that, and then we

25:54.371 --> 26:05.545
moved it back to the first of March, I believe it is. 
So the workload, it just gradually builds up. Of

26:08.910 --> 26:14.877
course, you continue getting test scores in 
during that time where you can make a decision. We

26:18.158 --> 26:23.751
started going from the seventh semester I think to 
a sixth semester transcript too. If you waited

26:23.831 --> 26:28.984
until seven you could not possibly get all the work 
done so we were using the

26:31.951 --> 26:39.290
transcript, and it just slowly builds up, so to 
speak, till you get to the deadline, which was

26:31.951 --> 26:39.290
March the 1st. By that time, you've got all the 
applications in. You've already admitted a lot of

26:41.916 --> 26:46.568
the students, but then your review process, in the 
later years didn't kick in until March 1st. And

26:49.937 --> 26:55.282
that's when you started having to go through all of 
the reviews of the students who didn't meet the

26:49.937 --> 26:55.282
requirements. And they could write in and ask to 
have their application reviewed, I believe it was

26:55.302 --> 27:00.967
a procedure we used on them. I don't know what 
they're using now. What recruitment processes

27:03.128 --> 27:11.856
did we use then in terms of activities and mailings 
and so forth? Went to high school career? A couple.

27:13.897 --> 27:16.960
We went to high school, what's called college 
nights. Some of them called them career days, this

27:17.243 --> 27:20.607
kind of thing. Some of the kinds, sometimes the 
junior college would combine it with the high

27:20.667 --> 27:24.171
school. Most of the time the junior college or 
community college did their separately. We did

27:27.935 --> 27:28.536
that. We had a open house or something there at the 
university where, I think it was generally in the

27:29.677 --> 27:46.035
fall and generally on the football weekend as I 
recall, where all of the colleges had open house

27:29.677 --> 27:46.035
invited students in, which was a big recruiting 
tool on that. I think eventually we moved that to

27:46.488 --> 27:51.354
the spring, I believe.

27:53.196 --> 28:00.025
But a lot of the colleges would send 
representatives out to high schools to talk to

27:53.196 --> 28:00.025
students and do that. We had the former students 
often would have representatives in the areas and

28:00.125 --> 28:15.904
they would have functions of some kind to acquaint 
students with A&M and the admission requirements

28:00.125 --> 28:15.904
and so forth and this kind of thing. When do the best 
students get serious about making their

28:16.171 --> 28:26.348
decisions about when and where they're going to go 
to college? I think that the better students now

28:26.368 --> 28:37.065
will get their applications in early because they 
know that they can go ahead and get admitted and

28:26.368 --> 28:37.065
they may apply to four or five different schools. 
It isn't a part of the problem. We may have cut that

28:39.090 --> 28:41.955
down some when we put in an application fee.

28:45.161 --> 28:46.824
They may not apply as many. They've got to put an 
application fee into every school they go to. But

28:49.369 --> 28:51.432
for some students, that's not a problem at all. But 
I think they apply earlier, generally. I have the

28:54.859 --> 28:58.345
impression that the spring of their junior year, 
And by the end of the fall of their senior year,

28:58.426 --> 29:03.351
they've decided probably pretty close. Most 
often, if we lost students, I'm using the word lost

29:04.953 --> 29:21.469
in quotation marks now, a student that had 
multiple applications and multiple admissions,

29:04.953 --> 29:21.469
usually we were up against UT Austin more often 
than anybody else? I would think so. I think they

29:22.150 --> 29:23.671
were our biggest competitor. But seldom to the 
private schools? Yeah. Because I think those who,

29:28.075 --> 29:37.125
I think if they want to go to a private school, they 
probably don't want to apply to anybody else. I may

29:37.145 --> 29:48.697
be wrong, but I think he was generally, he was 
against the University of Texas, possibly Texas

29:37.145 --> 29:48.697
Tech, but generally that would be from somebody 
out in West Texas. What did we do, did we do anything

29:49.698 --> 29:53.863
that didn't work with recruitment? things that in 
hindsight, no, that one fizzled out, didn't work?

30:01.482 --> 30:04.686
I don't know that we did anything that just didn't 
work. I mean, obviously, we never got the number of

30:04.826 --> 30:09.192
National Merit Scholars we wanted. Well, nobody 
gets it. Nobody gets it. That's right. Nobody gets

30:11.876 --> 30:12.858
it. And I think we had some good programs to attract 
them. Let's jump on that. Why did our number get as

30:17.564 --> 30:21.029
high as it did? We did a good job, and we're in the top 
ten still. Yeah. Why? How? It It's my feeling, and

30:26.142 --> 30:29.325
several, I guess. I think that we've done a better 
job of letting students know what kind of program

30:30.126 --> 30:35.091
we've got. We've done a better job of recruiting 
because, I mean, they've developed a program.

30:38.194 --> 30:44.580
We've brought them in and let them see just like you 
would a football athlete or an athlete. And I guess

30:46.141 --> 30:50.165
third, I think we started kicking the money in. The 
university did because, as I understand it,

30:53.530 --> 30:57.934
national merit scholarships that are sponsored 
by industry and those that are sponsored by the

30:53.530 --> 30:57.934
schools. And the schools can do as many as they want 
to, as I understand it. And when we started putting

31:01.417 --> 31:06.161
that money in, then we had more money to give 
scholarships. And of course, that's why Rice gets

31:06.181 --> 31:08.383
so many. They've got a foundation, which they can 
give a lot. The University of Texas has got a

31:10.404 --> 31:13.127
foundation, which they can give a lot. So I think 
that's where the big increase in the national

31:13.507 --> 31:20.112
merit enrollees has come from. We don't have them 
anymore that are getting those quote, out of

31:23.095 --> 31:28.102
state, I guess, from industry that may be coming 
in, although we're probably attracting more. But

31:28.122 --> 31:33.470
I think we've got it because the university got 
into the battle, if you will, with money. Let's

31:36.034 --> 31:36.434
see. Chronologically, we were Vandiver. The 
presidents who succeeded him was...
