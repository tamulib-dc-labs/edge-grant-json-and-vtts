WEBVTT

00:04.267 --> 00:05.689
This is July 29, 1987. We're in the dean's 
conference room at Texas A&M. I'm interviewing

00:11.056 --> 00:13.299
Chewie Hinojosa.

00:16.203 --> 00:16.764
OK. I first got involved with Texas A&M University 
back in 1954 when I came here as a student. I was in

00:23.213 --> 00:31.084
general studies at the time and trying to find a 
career or curriculum that would interest me.

00:31.705 --> 00:42.996
During the career day of that year, I was able to 
look around the university and saw that the work in

00:31.705 --> 00:42.996
the Department of Architecture interested me and 
felt that I could do it and enjoy it. Where were you

00:44.477 --> 00:45.738
living at that time? Originally, I came from south 
Texas in the little town of Ed Couch in the lower Rio

00:46.659 --> 00:51.604
Grande Valley. It's about 20 miles from the 
Mexican border and about 50 miles inland from the

00:52.524 --> 00:58.450
Texas Gulf Coast. You were up here for a career day. 
Actually, I was already enrolled at A&M as a

01:00.899 --> 01:06.506
student at the time, yeah. How did that happen? Why 
did you choose A&M? Oh, A&M, yes. Well, my father

01:11.333 --> 01:22.688
talked to a friend of his he knew who had a feet store 
there in Edcouch, and he was an A&M graduate. And so

01:23.191 --> 01:30.822
he asked him if he would suggest any university 
that I might go to after I graduated from high

01:23.191 --> 01:30.822
school, after getting ready to graduate from high 
school. So he, you know, Nagy, he recommended

01:30.842 --> 01:32.945
Texas A&M. He thought it was a good school. And so 
that was how I happened to select A&M, you know. And

01:38.714 --> 01:40.557
then you came up for career day. No. And I just 
applied. to the university at the time. It was a

01:45.830 --> 01:47.433
college, Texas A&M College. Sight unseen. Yes, 
sight unseen, just based on catalogs and whatever

01:49.216 --> 02:01.135
I could get in the mail from them after I decided to 
inquire about the university and decided to come

01:49.216 --> 02:01.135
to A&M. And so they accepted my enrollment based on 
the normal procedures for enrolling. It wasn't

02:07.133 --> 02:13.322
until I was here for about a year, almost a year, 
that I didn't know what to enroll in, basically. I

02:13.382 --> 02:16.186
just enrolled in a general engineering 
curriculum. And after about three quarters of the

02:17.548 --> 02:22.356
year, I wasn't really doing well. And I actually 
was in the Corps for one year. And it was a miserable

02:25.300 --> 02:28.845
experience, because we really couldn't study. 
Yeah. Was it mandated to be in the Corps at that

02:31.469 --> 02:33.512
time? Actually, interestingly enough, at the 
time, A new president had been hired by him who was

02:37.407 --> 02:40.391
not an Aggie. I believe his name was Morgan, 
President Morgan, if I remember correctly. And

02:45.417 --> 02:54.589
he, being, I believe, from the East, had requested 
and had gotten approval to make the Corps optional

02:45.417 --> 02:54.589
at the time. But when I enrolled, since all the 
literature was kind of geared to the Corps, and I

02:55.289 --> 03:02.098
was a member of the Texas National Guard at the 
time, I think it will be something like that. I did

03:04.691 --> 03:10.984
enjoy some discipline and kind of the rigors of the 
military and order and all that. That appealed to

03:11.024 --> 03:11.685
me. But when we landed here in the first weekend 
after we had been here for about a week in

03:12.426 --> 03:20.442
orientation, We lost about 15 or 20 freshmen that 
first weekend because of the crazy, I mean, this is

03:21.080 --> 03:31.556
like, they were going out to West Point, that's 
what they were trying to do. Interestingly

03:31.576 --> 03:45.957
enough, also, I guess part of the psychology was 
that the upperclassmen could not touch us

03:31.576 --> 03:45.957
physically because it had also been mandated that 
you could not touch a student physically,

03:31.576 --> 03:45.957
physically haze them because they had had some 
problems in the past.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.702
And they had some after that, too. Yes. They had 
some brothers afterwards, too. And so they had

03:51.324 --> 03:55.808
given strict orders they would not touch a student 
physically. So they launched a psychological

03:55.828 --> 03:58.571
warfare, which is probably worse. Yeah. Because 
they really, it was a reign of terror on us all the

03:59.372 --> 04:04.817
time, constantly, constantly. And if I remember 
correctly, the numbers out of, I think our outfit

04:05.518 --> 04:09.582
had 120 freshmen. And there were about 60 of us left 
by the middle of the school year. And all of us were

04:15.383 --> 04:19.427
just barely hanging in there grade-wise and so 
forth. And then about the end of the year, about 30

04:19.447 --> 04:25.273
of us was left in the outfit. And so I said, well, 
this is not really what I'm looking for. I mean, I

04:27.335 --> 04:28.496
came to study. I didn't feel I needed all this 
exorbitant discipline. But we couldn't study. We

04:32.900 --> 04:33.501
couldn't eat. I went home. They thought I was some 
kind of a refugee. I lost weight. I wasn't that

04:37.885 --> 04:39.127
heavy to begin with. My hair was cut short. I looked 
like I had come out of Huntsville. So

04:43.733 --> 04:49.159
I said, well, I don't need this. And since the Corps 
was optional, I went ahead and finished out the

04:49.339 --> 04:52.203
year. I felt, OK, I'll finish out my commitment for 
that year that I had agreed to do. And the next year,

04:56.368 --> 04:58.690
I went civilian still. And also, because I had used 
the career days and opportunity to look around,

04:59.711 --> 05:09.082
and I believe in career days for that reason, 
because it did help me to kind of see the

04:59.711 --> 05:09.082
opportunities that were available to me as a 
student here. I did go around all the different

05:09.963 --> 05:12.306
departments that they And when I got to the fourth 
floor of the academic building where the

05:12.826 --> 05:23.542
architecture school used to be, I immediately 
sensed that I could relate to the work and to the

05:12.826 --> 05:23.542
environment and everything else. So I made my 
decision quickly, and I said, okay, that's what

05:23.602 --> 05:27.668
I'm going to do. I'm going to change curriculums 
coming at the end of the school year and when I

05:27.688 --> 05:31.794
enroll for the next year. Who was the dean? Yeah, I 
guess an interesting anecdote. I was counsel. I

05:36.849 --> 05:40.733
had to go through counseling because I was just 
barely scraping by with a C average. And the

05:41.554 --> 05:49.063
counselor, after they did all the testing and 
everything else, told me that I had no aptitude for

05:41.554 --> 05:49.063
architecture and anything related to the field. 
But interesting enough, the following year, I was

05:49.784 --> 05:52.848
a distinguished student. My grade points shot up 
very high. And I managed to get on the dean's list as

05:55.671 --> 05:58.134
a distinguished student. And from there on, it was 
fine. I enjoyed the program and everything else. I

06:02.843 --> 06:06.087
really felt that I was doing what I wanted to do. And 
then during that year, we had various people

06:06.667 --> 06:11.893
visiting lectures that came to the university. It 
was a good lecture program. We had a good lecture

06:12.914 --> 06:14.035
series. And I met different people from around 
this country. And I got to know other faculty in the

06:17.959 --> 06:20.983
advanced years. I got to know Joe McGraw, who was 
then a design professor, and Professor Edward

06:21.003 --> 06:29.492
Romanek, who was also the director of the design 
studios. And they sort of were, they took me under

06:29.911 --> 06:35.680
their wing so that they could help me along and gave 
me encouragement. And then I got to meet, well, I

06:35.700 --> 06:46.296
visualized myself finishing architecture and 
going to, you know, work actually, work for a firm

06:35.700 --> 06:46.296
and going to architectural practice and 
hopefully eventually get my license and all that

06:35.700 --> 06:46.296
business. But during the last year or so, I then got 
interested, of course, in teaching and they

06:54.953 --> 06:57.817
Professor Ramegan-McGraw encouraged me if I 
would be interested in teaching. They needed some

06:57.837 --> 06:59.879
faculty, so I taught for three years. And during 
that time, they had some guest speakers. And one of

07:03.123 --> 07:06.808
them was Reginald Isaacs from Harvard. And he had 
been in South America and was on his way back to

07:07.468 --> 07:14.557
Harvard when they had asked him if he would lecture 
here. So he came and lectured at A&M at the time. And

07:17.381 --> 07:19.583
so we visited and we talked. And so he indicated 
that he would be interested in my applying at

07:20.304 --> 07:24.049
Harvard. in planning. And so I did that later, and I 
was accepted. And so after working for one summer

07:29.440 --> 07:38.194
at Caudill Rowland Scott, and actually worked 
with Bill Caudill that particular summer, it was

07:29.440 --> 07:38.194
an interesting experience in itself. Great guy. I 
really enjoyed working with him, and he was really

07:39.175 --> 07:42.380
an inspiration. I then came back and taught for two 
years at A&M, and then applied at Harvard, and got

07:42.680 --> 07:50.132
accepted, and went for two years in the graduate 
planning program. I got my master's in city

07:51.033 --> 07:52.816
planning there. What year? That was in 62, went 
from 62 to 1964. I taught from 60 to 62, I'm sorry,

07:59.501 --> 08:03.045
here in architecture. Then I worked in Houston the 
summer of 1960, and I worked in Harold Hamilton's

08:03.065 --> 08:11.034
office in Dallas in the summer of 63. So then in, I'm 
sorry, in 1961. Then in 1962, and then I went to

08:15.218 --> 08:18.322
Harvard until 64. And there I got a job. I'm sorry, 
well, after I finish, rather, I interviewed some

08:21.927 --> 08:29.578
people from California and had gotten a job, 
actually a job offer. I interviewed with a firm

08:29.618 --> 08:37.610
representative from a firm in San Francisco, 
Warneke, John Carl Warneke's firm. He had been out

08:37.630 --> 08:40.695
to the East Coast and was interviewing at 
different schools. And so I was introduced to him.

08:43.004 --> 08:45.548
That's interesting, because I was working in his 
office. Really? Yeah. Well, they were setting up a

08:46.789 --> 08:51.936
planning department, actually, within the 
architecture firm at the time, and they needed

08:46.789 --> 08:51.936
somebody to help them set it up. They left their 
libraries and their expertise in planning. So I

08:56.142 --> 09:07.358
did, and we got off well, and so I got everything 
packed, and I took off, went home to see my parents,

08:56.142 --> 09:07.358
and then I drove in a little Ford Falcon all the way 
to California in the middle of the hottest summer I

09:07.523 --> 09:10.066
can imagine. When we hit Southern California, it 
was 110 or 120 degrees, something like that.

09:14.713 --> 09:16.595
Anyway, I survived the trip and got to California. 
But when I got to San Francisco, this gentleman I

09:16.615 --> 09:23.425
had interviewed with told me, I have a very 
interesting job assignment for you. And so I said,

09:23.705 --> 09:24.927
let's talk about it. So I did. I had got myself 
checked in. And he wanted to send me to Hawaii. And I

09:30.541 --> 09:32.363
said, well, I don't know. I said, I was interested 
in coming out to California, because I've heard so

09:32.443 --> 09:35.407
much about California. I wanted to really get to 
know California, San Francisco area, the whole

09:35.427 --> 09:39.612
stadium. So I wasn't too keen on that. So I managed 
to contact, I was kind of in the process of making an

09:41.494 --> 09:50.225
arrangement to ship my car and everything to 
Hawaii. And I just, by luck, happened to call a

09:50.765 --> 10:00.497
former professor of mine, Professor Joseph J. 
McGraw, who at the time had also, before that even

09:50.765 --> 10:00.497
had gone to California, was working in 
California. And I sort of kept some

10:00.967 --> 10:05.473
correspondence with him, and I just thought I'd 
say hello and see how he was doing. And so he said,

10:06.234 --> 10:09.538
well, what are you doing out here on the West Coast? 
I said, I didn't realize you were interested in

10:09.558 --> 10:11.401
coming out to the West Coast. He said, well, I 
wasn't either. I just sort of thought I would. And

10:14.325 --> 10:25.219
so he started telling me what he was doing, who he 
was working with in this fairly large firm in the

10:14.325 --> 10:25.219
Bay Area, and that there were native people, and 
that if I was interested in working for their firm,

10:25.486 --> 10:27.089
I could have a job, you know. And so he offered me a 
position in their firm. And he explained the kind

10:29.493 --> 10:30.915
of work that the firm did. It was an architecture, 
engineering, and planning firm. And so I said,

10:33.519 --> 10:34.881
well, I don't know. I have to check with these 
people first because I already made my

10:34.901 --> 10:38.027
commitments to them. So once I could not change 
them, he gave me an assignment in San Francisco

10:38.047 --> 10:43.956
office, in Wernicke's office. I decided then to go 
with, at the time, it was Woolsey, Hamm, and Blair,

10:43.976 --> 10:52.270
fairly large firm in California. And I started 
working on a Sunday afternoon. They were so busy at

10:55.691 --> 10:56.733
the time. California was an incredibly busy state 
at the time. That was 1962? This was in 1964. Right.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.465
At Foster City. In 1964, the firm had built the 
first building in the new town called Foster City,

11:05.485 --> 11:15.620
which was sort of an invention building into the 
Bay Area. It had been approved, of course, and so

11:15.640 --> 11:17.062
forth. By Jack Foster from Texas. Yes. Yes, I 
didn't realize his origin. That's where we met.

11:24.516 --> 11:24.916
That's right. We were working with William Blair, 
and it was an interesting operation because we

11:25.117 --> 11:35.551
had, I think, a very unique setup of planners, 
engineers, architects working together in

11:25.117 --> 11:35.551
interdisciplinary teams, which I have believed 
in. See, Joe McGraw was there, and Jim Gardner. Did

11:42.521 --> 11:43.682
he arrive later? I'm not quite sure. Jim, I think, 
arrived later, yeah. And Matt Copenhaver. Matt

11:50.722 --> 11:51.928
Copenhaver was there. Dick Ehrenberger was 
there. Let's see who else did we play. Well, that's

11:59.378 --> 12:02.242
enough talent for one firm. It was a very 
interesting group, actually. And the

12:04.225 --> 12:11.535
development design department, which we called 
3D department, was an interesting department

12:04.225 --> 12:11.535
because we brought all these people together into 
a team. And we did the preliminary work and the

12:11.555 --> 12:15.380
selling of the studies to clients. And then the 
preliminary concepts were hammered out by this

12:16.081 --> 12:18.865
group. And then they were passed on to the other 
individuals for the surveying and the actual

12:18.905 --> 12:26.135
engineering and cost estimates and so forth. So it 
made for an interesting combination. After

12:28.606 --> 12:44.502
having been with the firm for actually, I guess it 
was less than a year, they decided to encourage me

12:28.606 --> 12:44.502
to continue with the firm by giving me a bonus at the 
end of the year, which they seldom gave to anybody

12:28.606 --> 12:44.502
who was with the firm less than a year. And the guys 
said they were in a real quandary about it. So I felt

12:47.045 --> 12:48.246
good about that. I felt I wanted to continue with 
this firm. And they, in fact, gave me more

12:49.767 --> 12:53.171
responsibilities and larger assignments. I got 
to work on the Southside's plan with it for the big

12:55.015 --> 13:03.253
developer, Dolger, Mr. Dolger, who had done 
basically built all of that stuff. South San

13:03.757 --> 13:04.518
Francisco. South San Francisco area after the 
war, which made the Tiki-Taki house famous. He's

13:09.465 --> 13:10.967
the guy who actually built them. You had a hand in 
that. No, I did not have a hand in the Tiki-Takis. I

13:14.993 --> 13:19.619
did have an interesting experience meeting the 
man, because he was a very interesting fellow,

13:14.993 --> 13:19.619
actually. He was a very down-to-earth guy, and he 
felt that he was meeting and addressing a need that

13:19.719 --> 13:29.713
wasn't being met by anybody else for low- and 
middle-income families, especially after the

13:19.719 --> 13:29.713
war when there was an with a high shortage of 
housing. And one of his policies, an interesting

13:32.436 --> 13:43.590
one that he had at the time he was building houses in 
South San Francisco area was that he would put a

13:32.436 --> 13:43.590
tree in front of every house as a minimum in the 
landscaping and so forth. So we went back and drove

13:43.730 --> 13:46.574
around this area. And it really looked kind of 
decent, even though it was kind of high density.

13:50.499 --> 13:52.621
Houses were packed in kind of tight, to be sure. But 
he had kept up a fairly attractive quality

13:53.282 --> 13:59.650
development after all. In the new area that we were 
working in, the 25,000 acre that we were working

14:00.085 --> 14:11.702
with him now, that was definitely a quality 
development, and he wanted that, and he wanted to

14:00.085 --> 14:11.702
set a good standard, and it was a beautiful area of 
the county. How long were you with Woolsey

14:12.082 --> 14:13.825
Hammond, Blair? Well, I was there in the area about 
a year and a half, and then at the end of 1965, they

14:13.845 --> 14:25.502
had gotten some assignments in South America, and 
they had put some teams together to send When the

14:26.056 --> 14:28.639
projects came in, they didn't have anybody to 
send. Everybody backed out. They didn't want to go

14:30.341 --> 14:31.722
for some reason or another. Yeah, so then I had the 
opportunity of my life. The vice president said

14:36.587 --> 14:43.515
they needed to send someone to take care of some 
very substantial projects in Chile. There was a

14:44.736 --> 14:51.163
program, actually, by the Chilean government to 
start planning in the country, establish

14:44.736 --> 14:51.163
planning in the country. They were doing national 
planning, regional planning, and local

14:51.864 --> 14:55.067
planning. And our job was to develop the local 
planning end of it. And in order to do national

14:58.680 --> 15:10.983
planning, they felt they needed to have more 
information at the local level in order to bring

14:58.680 --> 15:10.983
together all the plans and therefore use those to 
put together the national budgets for different

14:58.680 --> 15:10.983
categories of investments. I think that I had left 
and had taken a leave of absence from the firm

15:11.083 --> 15:18.237
before you left for Chile. and had gone with the 
Association of Bay Area Governments. That's

15:22.091 --> 15:22.351
right. You were in transition to go to Association 
of Bay Area Governments. That was all because of my

15:25.935 --> 15:27.496
thesis. Oh, really? Which was on regional 
planning in the Bay Area. I see. Well, that was

15:31.740 --> 15:33.922
certainly the place to go at the time. Yeah, it was a 
good move. Yeah, it was an impressive operation at

15:36.125 --> 15:46.975
AIPAC, and I had a little knowledge of it, of 
course, because we had to do some relating our own

15:36.125 --> 15:46.975
local planning in the area, and we were very 
conscious of what they were trying to do.

15:47.377 --> 15:50.309
coordinate the whole Bay region was an impressive 
project. And to this day, it seems to be an

15:50.409 --> 15:52.859
impressive effort. We had pretty good support 
from the federal government. Oh, yes. It was a big

15:56.594 --> 15:57.859
effort. I think certainly that also led to the 
creation of the Association of Bay Area

15:58.615 --> 16:07.432
Governments, of course, which brought unity 
between county cities and the state. A lot of

16:08.174 --> 16:10.498
large-scale projects had to be coordinated at 
that level. It couldn't be done otherwise without

16:10.558 --> 16:12.041
that agency. I think it created an awareness of the 
area as a region, which resulted in the Bay

16:12.402 --> 16:19.476
Conservation and Development Commission. I was 
going to say, that then was a follow-up with the

16:19.456 --> 16:23.361
Conservation Commission. And the California 
Coastal Zone Commission. Right. And that was also

16:26.424 --> 16:35.635
forerunners of many of the coastal zone 
management and large area management, regional

16:26.424 --> 16:35.635
management programs we have since come to know. 
Well, back to Chile. You were down there, and how

16:37.016 --> 16:39.319
long were you in Chile? Well, I was there for two and 
a half years. Two and a half years. And you finished

16:42.002 --> 16:45.246
your work, and then you came back to Wolseyham and 
Blair? After I finished the work there, they

16:45.466 --> 16:48.670
wanted me to come back to the... San Francisco 
office, San Mateo office. But at the time, I had

16:53.088 --> 16:58.796
been in correspondence with Professor McGraw, 
who had expressed an interest in my coming back. He

16:59.217 --> 17:06.528
had left Wilson, Hammond, Blair, I believe, about 
a year before I left to go to Chile, approximately.

17:07.049 --> 17:16.363
And he had been offered a job over here at Texas A&M 
University to head the planning program because

17:07.049 --> 17:16.363
they had, actually, when he was here in 
architecture, they had proposed a planning

17:07.049 --> 17:16.363
program, and it was not approved. But it had 
finally gotten approved around the middle 60s.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.477
And so he was asked if he would come and have that 
program. So he had done that in, I believe it was in

17:21.497 --> 17:25.666
65 when he came to establish it. And so I had been in 
Chile for two and a half years, so that would be 68.

17:30.957 --> 17:36.047
So I think by then, Joe had been working on the 
program for two or three years, something to that

17:30.957 --> 17:36.047
effect. And so he needed faculty and had asked me if 
I would join the faculty. I think that Jim Gardner

17:40.743 --> 17:43.266
was already here. I think Jim, yes, had left the 
California firm and had come over to the

17:43.506 --> 17:48.652
department. Yes, by then he was here too, that's 
right. So you were the third faculty member in the

17:51.556 --> 17:55.120
planning department. I believe so, because when 
did you come here? I came after you were here. Okay,

17:58.564 --> 17:59.786
so that would be right then. Yeah, I came in the fall 
of 1969. Okay, that's right. I came here in the fall

18:03.690 --> 18:08.556
of 68, so about a year apart. It was a young program. 
It was a new program. It had been established and

18:12.684 --> 18:25.660
had gone through the first three years that were 
required by, at the time, APA for recognition and

18:12.684 --> 18:25.660
had met those requirements and had the kind of 
recognition that was required at the time. So that

18:25.680 --> 18:28.905
was the first program instead of Texas, actually. 
A recognized program instead of Texas. So it was an

18:32.690 --> 18:35.894
exciting experience to come back to the 
University. I never thought I would come back to

18:35.994 --> 18:37.716
A&M. And I was, you know, first teaching here, a 
student, but it was a good experience to come back.

18:43.513 --> 18:46.596
We had an exciting program. Okay, well then, what 
were your ideas at that time, or did you remember

18:48.098 --> 18:55.907
what your ideas were on planning education? Did 
you, had you any philosophy that had developed

18:55.927 --> 19:01.233
through your practice? Yeah, well, the practice 
had been certainly valuable to alert me to the the

19:06.485 --> 19:08.167
realities of the world out there. In Chile, I 
really learned a lot about planning trial by fire,

19:08.728 --> 19:16.380
so to speak, because I was alone 7,000 miles away 
from my home office. And although we had really

19:16.440 --> 19:24.171
top-notch people looking over my shoulder, like 
Francis from Berkeley, who was a special

19:16.440 --> 19:24.171
consultant. He was down there. Well, he was at 
Berkeley, but he went down there once during the

19:25.133 --> 19:30.180
process, or twice. But he had been in Latin America 
for many years before that, so he knew the country

19:30.700 --> 19:34.865
well and a lot of the people there. And he was a 
recognized international consultant in Latin

19:35.605 --> 19:41.151
America, and actually elsewhere, too, in Europe. 
And so he was a good guide. And then we had other

19:44.075 --> 19:45.777
people from the firm. Still, such great business 
communications weren't that great. You

19:50.121 --> 19:53.485
oftentimes had to act without complete guidance 
always having the answers there from your

19:53.667 --> 19:56.391
superiors and so forth. So I had to really look up a 
lot of the stuff I had studied in school and reread

19:56.411 --> 20:03.740
it and reconsider it in the light of the actual 
practice. They've had so much political turmoil

20:04.061 --> 20:06.504
in Chile. How did that affect your work? Well, it 
was at times rough because we were outsiders at the

20:10.169 --> 20:15.676
time. This was at the height of the Vietnam War, and 
anti-Americanism was running pretty high in some

20:15.696 --> 20:20.923
of these countries. The Communist Party and some 
of the other socialist parties were pretty

20:21.325 --> 20:27.112
powerful there in that part of the world. Oh, 
excuse me. I'm sorry. Yeah, these groups were very

20:29.134 --> 20:31.076
outspoken. And, of course, the Frey 
administration at the time was trying to open up

20:31.237 --> 20:39.967
democracy in the country and really provide a 
democratic environment. So it did permit a lot of

20:40.027 --> 20:44.472
outspokenness on the part of opposition parties. 
There was a dialogue always going on in the

20:44.492 --> 20:49.678
newspapers, in the media, news media, and so 
forth. It was a very interesting experience

20:49.658 --> 21:02.974
because Chile was a tug-of-war with Cuba because 
Castro's Cuba had become a challenge to the United

20:49.658 --> 21:02.974
States, hegemony in the area. They were using 
Chile as a way of saying there was another way to go

21:03.955 --> 21:08.721
about democratizing these countries. You don't 
have to always use force. that there can be a

21:10.550 --> 21:15.099
positive approach through democratic 
procedures. And so President Frey was trying to

21:15.740 --> 21:29.706
slowly Chileanize a lot of the things that were 
actually, a lot of the big companies and the big

21:15.740 --> 21:29.706
corporations that were owned by outside 
interests, American and European interests. the

21:30.091 --> 21:37.102
big mining copper mines and so forth, which really 
were the backbone of the country's economy, were

21:30.091 --> 21:37.102
really owned by outsiders. They had really no say 
in the matter, very little say in the matter, in

21:37.302 --> 21:40.788
fact. I understand a lot of British interests were 
there. Yes, they were very strong. The British

21:45.175 --> 21:49.642
interest was also very strong in the mining and the 
phosphate mines and the copper mines as well. And

21:50.483 --> 21:55.491
when the price of copper folded, they just left. 
Yes, it just packed up and left everything.

21:57.777 --> 21:58.158
Exactly. And the country, you see, depended on 
income from copper. That was their main

22:00.383 --> 22:02.909
moneymaker for the country. So during the war, of 
course, this was a big income generator. And so it

22:05.695 --> 22:12.671
heightened the need by Chileans, who were very 
much nationalists, of course. And there's

22:12.711 --> 22:14.695
nationalists that we can get about our own 
country. They wanted their country to have some

22:15.164 --> 22:22.612
control over their key resources on which the 
country depended to be able to set some policy for

22:15.164 --> 22:22.612
national development. Exactly, instead of 
having to just pack up and leave you whenever they

22:23.633 --> 22:28.598
want to, you know, have something that was a little 
more consistent. And also to have a little more say

22:28.618 --> 22:33.303
about the procedures for mining and how the 
resources would be utilized. Well, it's

22:33.323 --> 22:34.884
insulting not to. Oh, yes. And I could see, and that 
was a very important learning experience for me, I

22:35.966 --> 22:40.210
could see why there was so much anti-Americanism 
developing in this region of the world, because

22:40.190 --> 22:49.224
they could see the ugly American coming in there 
and taking over a lot of these investments. And

22:49.725 --> 22:54.151
while it's important, I don't want to minimize the 
effort on the part of the American investor. I

22:54.312 --> 22:55.393
think it's an important thing. It's a risky 
venture, and it takes a lot of gumption to do it,

22:56.054 --> 23:00.080
too. And that's good, and I think that should be 
encouraged. I also think that a lot of times they

23:02.544 --> 23:07.632
were able to corrupt local officials who would 
manipulate their position and their position,

23:08.050 --> 23:16.519
the arrangement, in such a manner that the country 
was being, as a whole, left out of the picture. And

23:16.639 --> 23:29.892
this is what, while it may have sounded like an 
innocent thing at the time it was occurring, this

23:16.639 --> 23:29.892
occurred, of course, way back in the turn of the 
century, and even before the end of the century,

23:16.639 --> 23:29.892
when us states were really important to the 
country. This engendered, this animosity began

23:30.173 --> 23:35.458
to build up, and it really surfaced in the 60s. And 
the Vietnam War really brought all this out to the

23:35.675 --> 23:38.379
surface. And we had tremendous, of course, 
tug-of-war going on around the world at the time.

23:43.307 --> 23:54.584
So it was an interesting experience for me because 
I saw my country from a distance, and I appreciated

23:43.307 --> 23:54.584
the United States even more from a distance, 
because I think it's the greatest country in the

23:43.307 --> 23:54.584
world to this day, even with all its mistakes and 
flaws. But I also saw how we could do a lot more and be

23:55.766 --> 24:00.653
a lot better partners, so to speak, in 
development. So the planning we were doing, we

24:00.953 --> 24:14.695
were motivated, of course, to do good planning so 
that these communities could be planned for

24:00.953 --> 24:14.695
appropriately and the resources be used 
carefully so they could have a better environment

24:00.953 --> 24:14.695
for their housing areas and their commercial 
areas and their various needs for public

24:00.953 --> 24:14.695
services. And that was a challenge we were opposed 
with. And the planning was very much part of the

24:17.359 --> 24:28.817
political arm of the Frey administration because 
all this was being done, of course, to show that

24:17.359 --> 24:28.817
they could work efficiently and produce a good 
environment for the population. and complement

24:29.135 --> 24:34.103
whatever the social services they were trying to 
develop through good planning. So it had that

24:34.363 --> 24:36.366
dimension to it. So we were obviously thrust into a 
political environment automatically.

24:39.471 --> 24:41.214
Everything we did had political implications. I 
had some interesting experience in the southern

24:41.274 --> 24:47.864
part of the country, because there was some 
enclaves over there of communists and

24:41.274 --> 24:47.864
socialists. There were very strong 
anti-American feelings. I had an interesting

24:52.253 --> 25:00.758
experience because being of Latin extraction, 
Mexican-American, Mexican extraction, a lot of

24:52.253 --> 25:00.758
times these people didn't know who I was. They 
thought I was Chilean, they thought I was

25:01.781 --> 25:05.151
Peruvian, they thought I was Central American. 
Could they tell by your accent? No. Apparently, I

25:07.514 --> 25:09.777
picked up their own language so quickly. Within 
about three or four or six months, I was talking

25:09.918 --> 25:12.281
like they were. I used their terms, all their 
colloquialisms. At times, they thought I was

25:15.606 --> 25:17.389
Chilean. Chile's a heterogeneous country. It's 
very cosmopolitan in the first place. Like

25:20.273 --> 25:21.275
Argentina. Very much so, yeah. Very, very 
well-educated people. Good-sized middle class.

25:27.665 --> 25:31.090
The best professionals you can find are in Chile 
and Argentina, yeah. I think the climate has a lot

25:31.110 --> 25:32.772
to do with that. They're in a temperate zone. Yes, 
they are. And I guess they had a good stock of

25:34.795 --> 25:42.101
migrations from Spain and Europe, Germany, and so 
forth. They did have a pretty strong cadre of

25:42.542 --> 25:46.585
professional middle-class groups. And the 
countries are very strong for that reason. They

25:48.607 --> 25:50.849
have tremendous capability.

25:52.591 --> 25:59.897
So I had the opportunity to prepare two general 
development plans, one for the city of Puerto

25:52.591 --> 25:59.897
Montt, which is the extreme south part of the 
country. It's a very interesting environment.

26:01.158 --> 26:02.319
Better spell it. Better spell it. Yes, Porto 
Montt, yeah, P-U-E-R-T-O, and then another word,

26:03.348 --> 26:11.601
M-O-N-T-T, which I believe is a German word. It's a 
German name of a family name in Chile. This port is

26:17.511 --> 26:24.562
the last major port on the mainland of Chile before 
you start the fjords that go all the way down to the

26:17.511 --> 26:24.562
southern tip of the continent. The continent 
fragments itself with a bunch of islands and so

26:25.303 --> 26:29.490
forth, fjords. Down to Tierra del Fuego, where the 
Fuegans live. Right. Down to Antarctica, which

26:35.082 --> 26:38.527
they claim a little slice of. And so Puerto Montt 
was the main port and the first port that a ship

26:39.068 --> 26:48.160
would make at the rounding Cape Horn. Tierra del 
Fuego, yes. And so it was always a thriving port,

26:50.663 --> 26:54.128
major regional capital. It still remains a major 
regional capital, but it lost some of its economic

26:54.766 --> 27:04.168
strength when the Panama Canal was built and the 
shipping then didn't have to go always around the

26:54.766 --> 27:04.168
Cape. However, it used to be an important port, so 
we did the planning. And they also suffered from

27:07.614 --> 27:09.897
earthquakes. And this has been a tremendous 
problem for them. So when we were there, I was doing

27:12.621 --> 27:15.405
the planning. We started the work in 66, somewhere 
in there. They had suffered some earthquakes

27:20.492 --> 27:28.463
before in 50 and in, I believe, 62, somewhere in 
there. And they were rebuilding the port and other

27:28.483 --> 27:30.365
facilities. And so I found a lot of geologic 
information that was put together by the U.S.

27:34.085 --> 27:37.532
Geologic Survey and other international groups. 
And I found that in California, interestingly

27:38.233 --> 27:41.179
enough, before I left to go to Chile. And I had this 
information with me, and we used it in the

27:41.680 --> 27:44.045
planning. We looked at the soils, and we looked at 
the location of faults, fault lines, and used this

27:44.085 --> 27:52.262
information to locate the new residential areas 
and the new public facilities and so forth, trying

27:52.242 --> 27:56.849
to avoid the dangerous soils and so forth. And so it 
was a beginning of integration of the spatial,

27:56.909 --> 28:05.323
physical aspects with these danger areas as 
identified by the geologists. And what was the

28:05.823 --> 28:07.065
other city? The other city following was the city 
of Osorno. Osorno, O-S-O-R-N-O,

28:11.813 --> 28:18.283
is the capital also of a province of Yankeewe. And 
it's an interesting city because it concentrates

28:18.635 --> 28:25.168
a large number of German population. that came 
over in the late 1800s, settlers to help settle

28:25.469 --> 28:31.594
that part of the country. Did they speak Spanish? 
Yes, a lot of them did, in fact, speak Spanish. It

28:35.818 --> 28:45.207
was kind of curious to see a tall, six foot three or 
four, blond, with blue eyes, speaking Chilean,

28:35.818 --> 28:45.207
and with a German name. And a lot of prominent 
German names in the rural countryside. I think

28:49.691 --> 28:51.372
they speak mostly German. A lot of the old families 
still just speak German. And so it's an

28:53.414 --> 28:57.159
interesting project because it's the most 
dynamic province in the country. It has the

28:57.219 --> 28:58.440
strongest economy. It has a diversified economic 
base. It has agriculture and it has a milk

29:01.264 --> 29:09.934
processing product type industry. It has leather 
goods products industries and so forth. They've

29:14.580 --> 29:17.363
used this to diversify their economy base. In 
Osorno, they also produce the best beef in the

29:18.676 --> 29:23.582
country and have exported throughout the 
country. And when I was in Chile, because of the

29:24.223 --> 29:27.587
meat shortages, we had to ration beef. You could 
only buy it one time a week on Friday, usually

29:27.948 --> 29:32.413
Friday afternoons. And in Santiago, for example, 
the capital city, you could only eat meat once a

29:33.254 --> 29:37.640
week. But in Osorno, they ate meat every day 
because they produced it and they weren't about to

29:37.660 --> 29:42.726
ration themselves. As a Catholic country, I would 
think they would have sold fish on Friday. Yes,

29:45.993 --> 29:47.036
yes, right. That's true. No, I think the people 
did, too, do that, yes. But because of the

29:50.183 --> 29:56.057
rationing, then Friday became a very important 
day for acquiring meat, even though it was a

29:50.183 --> 29:56.057
Catholic country. They also promoted whale meat, 
interestingly enough, because of this. Again, it

30:00.536 --> 30:03.220
was a problem of cash flows. So anyway, we did the 
work, and we completed the studies. So Sorna was a

30:06.144 --> 30:09.088
very interesting experience because the mayor 
was very dynamic. Not German expression, he was a

30:09.609 --> 30:15.096
Spanish type, but very well-liked, very dynamic 
guy. He had a broad support, political support.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.323
He's probably the most dynamic politician I've 
gone into, you know. He managed to bring diverse

30:20.877 --> 30:31.110
groups together, and it made the planning very 
interesting for that same reason, because we did

30:20.877 --> 30:31.110
have a good, clear guide on what was critical and 
what they felt was priority. So the planning was,

30:31.630 --> 30:35.635
he gave us an office, and they had a 12-story office 
building. That was their municipal building that

30:35.916 --> 30:44.206
they financed, and they rented the lower floors 
for offices to get income to pay for the building.

30:45.688 --> 30:48.131
They had office spaces, and they gave us office 
space. They gave us personnel to do all our work,

30:48.151 --> 30:49.973
you know, So it was a very well-run thing. Of 
course, it was a great advantage for you being able

30:52.181 --> 30:56.005
to speak Spanish. Yes, that was very helpful, 
definitely. And I think if they had sent a

30:57.507 --> 31:06.116
consultant they had initially intended to, which 
would not be people that were well versed in the

30:57.507 --> 31:06.116
language, they would have a very hard time 
completing the assignments. I would think so.

31:08.018 --> 31:13.665
Because of the political pressure, we only had 
literally 321 days to finish the assignments.

31:13.685 --> 31:14.425
That was seven months. That was calendar days, not 
working days. A job that I estimated would take 18

31:17.864 --> 31:26.898
months to finish in California with all the 
funding and resources available, we had to do in

31:17.864 --> 31:26.898
seven months in Chile. So it was very intense, very 
intense. And so I was blessed with good

31:29.182 --> 31:32.327
colleagues. We had good local professionals that 
helped and formed part of the team. So I was the only

31:37.075 --> 31:39.178
one, well, two of us from the firm. Sounds like you 
had good political leadership. Yeah. Yeah, very

31:41.978 --> 31:43.360
much so. And so we did well, and the ministry 
appreciated our work because we did a good piece of

31:43.380 --> 31:48.148
work. It was an interesting experience because, 
see, when we came, we were the only outside firm.

31:52.235 --> 31:53.717
All the rest were Chilean firms. There were no, 
except for one Chilean firm that had some

31:53.737 --> 31:58.946
planning, could claim planning experience. 
Everybody else were just basically

31:58.986 --> 32:02.071
architectural firms. So part of the task was not 
only to do the job, but to teach and to transmit the

32:02.091 --> 32:07.800
idea of planning to the local people and to the 
local professionals. And so we were always, when

32:11.587 --> 32:25.283
we first, of course, showed up on the scene, we 
said, oh, here comes this guy from the U.S., from

32:11.587 --> 32:25.283
California, and they're going to want to propose, 
you know, the moon, everything's going to cost,

32:11.587 --> 32:25.283
you know, this harebrained solutions to the 
problem. But interestingly enough, as our stay

32:25.684 --> 32:30.750
there continued and we developed the project, Our 
projects were the most reasonable and the most

32:31.000 --> 32:38.778
realistic in terms of the local economy and the 
availability of funds and the feasibility of

32:31.000 --> 32:38.778
getting them done. And, in fact, one day we were 
called in by the ministry to They wanted to find out

32:42.307 --> 32:49.656
why, except that there were no complaints coming 
out of Osorno about us, when they were getting

32:42.307 --> 32:49.656
complaints out of everybody else from around the 
country. And they wanted to know why. And so I

32:51.819 --> 32:59.489
explained that we worked very closely with the 
mayor, very closely with the council, the

32:51.819 --> 32:59.489
governor, and the local community officials. And 
you probably realized what the state of the

32:59.509 --> 33:02.232
technology was. Yes, and that was the California 
experience. We learned that in California,

33:03.934 --> 33:10.643
because the citizen participation was 
important, getting people involved early in the

33:03.934 --> 33:10.643
process and keeping them informed. So we took that 
over there, and it worked, and we gave reasonable

33:10.943 --> 33:18.631
solutions to complicated problems that we felt 
they could afford within their budgets. While the

33:19.212 --> 33:25.139
other guys were producing some very, I mean, L.A. 
was... Okay, of course, coming back from Chile,

33:25.159 --> 33:39.094
although the firm had wanted me to go back to 
California, they wanted me to continue with the

33:25.159 --> 33:39.094
firm, I had been offered a job at Texas A&M 
University, Professor McGraw, and Edward, at the

33:25.159 --> 33:39.094
time, was... Edward Romanek. Well, Professor 
McGraw was the director of the planning program

33:39.530 --> 33:43.154
here. And Professor Edward Romnick was the dean, 
yes, at the time. R-O-M-I-E-N-I-E-C. Right.

33:52.724 --> 34:00.492
R-O-M-I-E-N-I-E-C.

33:52.724 --> 34:00.492
And Edward Romnick was the dean, and Joe McGraw was 
the department program chairman. So they invited

34:00.512 --> 34:03.255
me if I would join the faculty. They wanted to 
expand the faculty. I think they had also an

34:06.766 --> 34:09.129
interest in the Latin American region. What year 
was that? That was in 68. I came back in the middle of

34:13.315 --> 34:16.139
68. So I started in the fall of 68. Were you married 
then? No, I was single. I got married the following

34:23.790 --> 34:25.433
year in 1969. In fact, on my way through here to say 
hello to my friends and introduce my new bride, we

34:25.633 --> 34:34.225
ran into the situation of a contract had been sent, 
or another contract, but a proposal, rather, a

34:34.677 --> 34:44.138
request for proposal had been sent to the 
university, to Jim Gardner, who then had joined

34:34.677 --> 34:44.138
the planning faculty, Professor Gardner. From 
Wilsey, Hammond, Blair. Who had been also at

34:45.361 --> 34:47.826
Wilsey, Hammond, Blair before in California. And 
Mr. Stan Ott. With McGraw and Cornish and

34:50.959 --> 34:52.961
Hinojosa. Yeah, right. I always call it the 
finishing school of planners. We all had gone

34:57.848 --> 34:59.790
through it and had gotten good experience out of 
it. And then Stanley Ott, who we knew, both of us

35:00.992 --> 35:13.869
knew, you and I knew at San Mateo, who had been 
planning director there, had got an assignment

35:00.992 --> 35:13.869
with USAID, the United States Agency for 
International Development, in Colombia. And so

35:14.430 --> 35:17.374
he sent this request proposal to Jim Gardner, whom 
he knew, and inquiring if we would be interested in

35:17.793 --> 35:25.801
responding to it by providing technical 
assistance in planning to the city of Cali, the

35:17.793 --> 35:25.801
second largest city in the country of Colombia. 
And so Jim Garner passed the document to me asking

35:26.621 --> 35:35.129
if I would be interested because it would require 
someone with the language capability and the

35:26.621 --> 35:35.129
interest in the Latin American region and so 
forth. And so myself and Tom Stallworth, Thomas

35:35.149 --> 35:45.319
Stallworth who was a local professional who had 
just finished the planning program and was a civil

35:35.149 --> 35:45.319
engineer but a very, very interesting person, and 
had an interest in the Latin American region, the

35:45.856 --> 35:51.363
two of us got together and responded to the 
request. So we sent back, we prepared the request,

35:51.964 --> 36:08.066
the response to the request for the proposal, and I 
took it with me, and on the road, on my honeymoon, I

35:51.964 --> 36:08.066
mailed it, I think, out of California after I 
finished all the questions they wanted answers

35:51.964 --> 36:08.066
to, and mailed it, signed it, and mailed it. And 
then when we get back about three weeks later,

36:08.546 --> 36:12.792
there was a cable that came in, saying that they 
wanted us to go, both Tom and I, to go and form part of

36:13.160 --> 36:17.406
this team that they were forming. There was 
another gentleman from the University of

36:17.947 --> 36:20.730
Wisconsin and another one from Berkeley. Do you 
know who they were? Aaron Horowitz from Berkeley

36:22.753 --> 36:28.060
was a housing specialist, old gentleman, very, 
very capable. And Ved Prakash was from the

36:28.942 --> 36:36.552
University of Wisconsin, and he did the financial 
analysis. Ved, V-E-D is his first name, and last

36:36.953 --> 36:45.965
name is P-R-A-K-A-S-H, very capable fellow UN 
expert type and so forth. And then Aaron Horowitz

36:46.586 --> 36:54.536
is from Berkeley, also very respected in the 
field, H-O-R-O-W-I-T-Z.

36:57.079 --> 37:06.792
Okay, so we spent actually the latter half of 69, I 
believe the first month of 70 in Colombia working

36:57.079 --> 37:06.792
with the Cali General Development Plan. and 
reorganize the whole work for them. And that's why

37:11.619 --> 37:14.342
you and I did not meet when I first got here. Yes. I 
arrived in October, one month after the fall

37:15.083 --> 37:19.648
semester had begun. I see, yes. And I had been 
invited by Dean Romanek at that time, I think at the

37:21.130 --> 37:31.762
request of Joe McGraw. And what had happened was 
they were short in architecture. And so I was

37:37.433 --> 37:42.478
invited to guest speak, and that worked out well. 
So then I got an invitation to join the faculty the

37:42.498 --> 37:49.986
first year in architecture, teaching fifth-year 
design. And then they would make room on the

37:50.867 --> 37:56.533
planning faculty for me the following year. So we 
didn't meet, because you were away in Cali. Yes, in

37:59.596 --> 38:01.838
Colombia, South America. Very true. And so then we 
came back in the spring then of 1970, which you had

38:02.818 --> 38:11.551
been here a semester then, and got back into the 
program. And of course, as I was telling you

38:12.152 --> 38:21.485
earlier, the turmoil that was going on in the world 
at the time because of the Vietnam War, it spilled

38:12.152 --> 38:21.485
over into our own environment here in our own 
campuses. And we were in a stage of reconsidering a

38:21.565 --> 38:26.813
lot of our policies and priorities and Jack 
Kennedy had, of course, established the Peace

38:27.350 --> 38:32.216
Corps program, which had generated a lot of 
interest abroad. And our kids were coming back

38:32.316 --> 38:36.162
with a lot of ideas about what they wanted to do with 
this world. And the environmental issue was

38:36.282 --> 38:39.506
beginning to heat up, too, the environmental 
crisis. The Vista volunteers were beginning to

38:40.507 --> 38:43.751
impact the communities where they were. In other 
parts of the country, they were having urban

38:44.933 --> 38:47.296
riots. Urban riots, right. I forget when the Watts 
riot was. But I mean, there was just, yeah,

38:50.340 --> 38:56.428
everywhere you could think of, Chicago, the 
Northeast, and so forth, they were having riots. A

38:56.678 --> 38:58.079
lot of turmoil, a lot of unrest. And that was also 
affecting the planning programs. And it seemed

39:01.603 --> 39:06.028
like the planning program, because I guess we were 
a maverick anyway on the campus to begin with. We

39:06.968 --> 39:10.352
kind of broke out of the mold, the more traditional 
mold here at the university. We were looked at with

39:11.793 --> 39:14.416
some suspicion. And our students were different. 
They did. I think that that was nationwide. Yeah,

39:19.141 --> 39:19.581
true. Most of the action on campuses, like at Kent 
State and Berkeley, really were instituted by

39:26.530 --> 39:29.394
architecture and planning students. Very much 
so. And there were young kids that were concerned

39:30.436 --> 39:39.469
with social problems, and the deterioration of 
our urban environments in the post-war era had not

39:30.436 --> 39:39.469
been accomplished. And they wanted to do things. 
They wanted to change this world. And I guess

39:43.155 --> 39:49.344
Kennedy also, John Kennedy, was inspirational in 
giving some of the spiritual guidance to this. And

39:49.424 --> 39:54.512
then the environmental movement took off, and 
that certainly became a very powerful moving

39:49.424 --> 39:54.512
force. And so all of that impacted the program, and 
our students were active, not perhaps certainly

39:55.032 --> 40:12.178
as active and demonstrative as the Berkeley 
students or elsewhere, but they still were

39:55.032 --> 40:12.178
raising questions and creating enough interest, 
you know, that sometimes they worried the

39:55.032 --> 40:12.178
administration and so forth. Yeah, of course, 
that was during the era of President Johnson's

40:12.198 --> 40:16.264
administration. Yes. In an era of fantastic 
social legislation. That's right. With the Model

40:20.921 --> 40:25.007
Cities program and Office of Economic 
Opportunities and so forth. Right. Because John

40:25.267 --> 40:28.612
Kennedy, of course, was a senator in 63, wasn't he? 
But his programs continued to... Were picked up by

40:30.495 --> 40:31.576
Johnson. Right. And Johnson continued. That's 
right. President Lyndon Johnson, whom, by the

40:33.158 --> 40:41.269
way, we met on our honeymoon on the way out to the 
West Coast by accident there at the... At the

40:33.158 --> 40:41.269
ranch? At the ranch, yeah. He was driving in with 
about 10 state governors from around the country

40:44.392 --> 40:50.899
that he was having a meeting with there at the 
Pedernales Ranch. And so we said hello to him and

40:51.700 --> 40:54.803
had a little chat with him. He was an interesting 
fellow. And anyway, of course, we're in the

40:56.986 --> 40:59.148
planning program. We're trying to respond to this 
concern by young people with the environment of

40:59.168 --> 41:06.256
the country, the planning conditions of the 
country. And planning was supposed to take a

41:06.336 --> 41:09.960
leadership role in influencing policymaking. So 
I had, of course, an interest in helping with that.

41:16.790 --> 41:18.252
And a very good background to do it. Yeah, well, the 
experience, of course, had been good, yeah, in

41:19.033 --> 41:22.478
California and Chile. And of course, at Harvard, 
we had also been imbued with similar concerns. I

41:26.264 --> 41:31.352
mean, the same kind of concerns had begun to 
surface when I was at Harvard, but it hadn't taken

41:26.264 --> 41:31.352
off yet. It was just beginning to start. And the 
activism was beginning to take off. We had some of

41:39.421 --> 41:40.203
that. And of course, I was concerned with trying to 
establish a professional program that was

41:40.323 --> 41:47.198
well-respected and well-recognized and that 
wasn't frivolous. Because a lot of it was

41:48.059 --> 41:49.743
frivolity, in fact. And of course, we were also 
impacted by some of the writings of Davidoff and

41:50.184 --> 41:57.700
Reiner, Tom Reiner and Paul Davidoff were talking 
about what was it, the choice theory of planning.

42:00.210 --> 42:00.670
Choice theory. Yeah, and so forth. And advocacy 
and all. The idea of advocacy, of groups doing

42:03.113 --> 42:05.836
their own plans. Well, to me, it was interesting, 
but at the same time, to me, it created a dilemma, a

42:06.316 --> 42:21.573
problem, because if we have a community plan, how 
can we have a bunch of isolated plans being

42:06.316 --> 42:21.573
developed by individualized community groups 
with their own ideas, what they thought the plan

42:06.316 --> 42:21.573
should be, if the whole thing couldn't be brought 
together? And that was, in fact, the Achilles

42:21.633 --> 42:25.577
heel, so to speak, of the idea. of that particular 
concept, you know. Well, I think at the extreme it

42:27.703 --> 42:31.487
led to anarchy in planning. Yes, exactly. There 
was no real official plan that anyone could look

42:32.848 --> 42:35.431
to. That's all you could look for was anarchy, 
exactly. It was total chaos and no focus of any

42:37.754 --> 42:40.677
kind. So I had, my concern was trying to 
incorporate the concept of citizen

42:41.097 --> 42:55.733
participation, maximum citizen involvement, 
certainly work, but working through the elected

42:41.097 --> 42:55.733
leadership, because I felt that they were the 
official representatives of the community that

42:41.097 --> 42:55.733
were elected to office, you know. And so I tried to 
strike a balance between citizens' involvement

42:56.303 --> 43:12.827
and be able to, through surveys and talking to 
people, having neighborhood community surveys,

42:56.303 --> 43:12.827
be able to, in fact, elicit what their concerns 
were and then introduce those into the community

42:56.303 --> 43:12.827
plan and have the leadership accept them because 
they were well-reasoned and well-developed. So

43:13.588 --> 43:21.619
it was a very interesting period for me to come back 
from Chile and get into this local environment

43:13.588 --> 43:21.619
here. Of course, we were a small department. We 
were a growing department at the time. I believe we

43:24.461 --> 43:27.385
must have had about 30 or 35 students, graduate 
students. We were just a graduate program. With

43:29.388 --> 43:30.048
one degree? One degree, the master's in urban 
planning. And we had about how many faculty, Bob?

43:39.981 --> 43:43.606
Let's see, Joe, Jim, yourself, and myself. Was it 
Claude Davis? I don't remember. I think Claude was

43:47.367 --> 43:54.243
teaching in political science, but he taught some 
of our undergraduate introductory courses.

43:54.403 --> 43:54.804
That's right. And these were courses that were set 
up to help introduce the environmental design

43:55.365 --> 44:04.065
students in the undergraduate programs to 
planning who might have an interest in the

43:55.365 --> 44:04.065
planning field. Which never did work. Well, up to a 
point in the day, we were able to attract some

44:05.980 --> 44:19.017
students, but never really fully integrated, 
because the whole concept of the environmental

44:05.980 --> 44:19.017
design program was not understood really by the 
department heads at the time that were running it.

44:20.439 --> 44:21.961
Or by the faculty in the other department. Or the 
faculty, yeah, because I saw it as a tremendous

44:21.981 --> 44:35.278
opportunity for a young student to come into the 
college and enter as a freshman and maybe explore

44:21.981 --> 44:35.278
architecture or landscape architecture or 
planning or building construction. or just

44:35.528 --> 44:41.995
general environmental design concerns, and then 
find his or her way eventually into some career

44:35.528 --> 44:41.995
focus. And that this was a much more healthy 
environment than when I was a freshman because

44:42.776 --> 44:50.765
when I was a freshman, it was either architecture 
or building construction. You had no other

44:50.825 --> 44:51.766
choice. And if you went too far into any one of those 
degrees, you would begin to lose credit values

44:52.426 --> 45:00.355
because other careers would require other 
backgrounds. I felt that this was, and I still

45:00.757 --> 45:06.563
think it is a good curriculum to develop properly. 
And so our undergraduate courses, we had three or

45:07.124 --> 45:16.694
four undergraduate courses, were designed to 
just explore and expose the students to the field

45:07.124 --> 45:16.694
of planning to see if in their graduate work they 
might pursue it. And certainly, just as citizens,

45:18.636 --> 45:23.100
they could make good use of it. Oh, yeah. In any 
field that they would go into knowing something

45:24.341 --> 45:30.628
about what is land use planning or what is zoning 
and how does it work and so forth certainly would be

45:31.098 --> 45:38.211
useful to anybody in civil engineering or 
architecture or any other field. Or just in

45:38.411 --> 45:40.395
voting. Just as a citizen, right, who can make some 
enlightenment judgments or go to the planning

45:40.435 --> 45:52.296
commission or before the planning commission and 
say a few things about their neighborhood because

45:40.435 --> 45:52.296
they know, at least they have a sense of the 
relationships of their neighborhood to the rest

45:40.435 --> 45:52.296
of the city. So yeah, that was true. That was 
important. So Claude Davis helped us with some of

45:55.503 --> 45:57.706
those courses. He taught partially in political 
science and partially over here. Eventually, of

46:01.692 --> 46:07.540
course, he was able to transfer over to the 
planning department and became a full-time

46:01.692 --> 46:07.540
member of our faculty. What courses were you 
teaching? I taught laboratories, the planning

46:09.543 --> 46:16.953
labs, 601 and 602, usually, were the ones that I 
taught. They were urban planning laboratories. I

46:19.897 --> 46:22.300
taught the comprehensive planning course on 
location. There wasn't a comprehensive planning

46:22.702 --> 46:24.725
course then. There wasn't? No. We had 365, but we 
didn't have comprehensive planning. I

46:31.695 --> 46:33.457
introduced the comprehensive planning course. 
Well, I thought it was already established.

46:35.140 --> 46:40.928
Anyway, when I taught it, I thought I prepared a- 
365 you might have taught. Possibly. I think

46:41.369 --> 46:43.412
that's probably what it was. We had 665, which 
became, in fact, the whole place graduate level

46:43.632 --> 46:47.297
course. All I know is that I taught it afterwards. I 
would teach sometimes a housing course. I would

46:54.429 --> 46:56.071
ask them to teach the housing course. And I also 
taught, well, I was asked to create two courses.

47:01.478 --> 47:03.500
One was planning in the developing countries. And 
one was planning 621, which was geared to Latin

47:03.801 --> 47:07.365
America. And then planning 620, which was geared 
to Latin America plus other parts of the

47:07.966 --> 47:13.633
developing world, Africa and Far East. And those 
courses were taught again. They were elective

47:16.670 --> 47:20.460
courses that were available to planning students 
and anybody on campus. And those became

47:21.162 --> 47:24.290
interesting courses because a lot of students 
took them from around the campus. And I always had

47:24.330 --> 47:29.884
these mixed classes of students in agriculture or 
engineering or planning.
