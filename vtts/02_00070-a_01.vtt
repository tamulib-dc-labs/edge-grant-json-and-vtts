WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:24.132
10 seconds before it starts recording this is may 
the 12th and we're looking out on a cloudy sky from

00:02.478 --> 00:24.132
the breakfast area i'm chatting with ann rudder 
erdman we've been acquainted for almost 40 years

00:02.478 --> 00:24.132
now and chatting with her about her experiences 
here, particularly seeking information about

00:25.242 --> 00:32.750
the role, the key role her father played at Texas 
A&M. You all moved to College Station in 1958.

00:40.098 --> 00:42.261
And you were getting ready to be what year in 
school? It was back to the middle of my sophomore

00:42.281 --> 00:44.283
year. In high school? In high school. Describe, as 
far as you recall, the reactions of the family at

00:46.745 --> 00:54.574
moving here. we weren't real sure what we were 
getting into. A&M,

00:57.967 --> 01:06.701
I can remember my brother coming to A&M with dad, 
but none of the three daughters had been here. And

01:07.462 --> 01:10.287
so we really were not, we just weren't sure. As far 
as you are able to recall, what did your dad think he

01:10.327 --> 01:23.127
was coming to do? What was his task? He didn't 
discuss that with me. He didn't discuss it. I know

01:29.452 --> 01:32.376
he was very excited about coming. Now he had been 
land commissioner, and I know had cleaned up a real

01:32.396 --> 01:39.346
first class mess that his predecessor had 
created. And he had earned the high regard of

01:40.788 --> 01:45.314
Governor Alan Shivers. Shivers, uh-huh. All 
right, now before, your dad was born where? Eden,

01:51.102 --> 01:51.843
Texas. Eden, and went to high school? Eden. and 
then to Tarleton, JTAC, and then here two years.

02:01.573 --> 02:04.056
And your mom grew up... In Menard. In Menard. Which 
was the next county to Eden. And she went to high

02:09.240 --> 02:11.543
school... In Menard. And then to the University of 
Texas. And then to the University of Texas. Now,

02:15.286 --> 02:20.671
I've heard that she was an acquaintance, had 
friends named Connelly. She did. Did she know

02:22.432 --> 02:23.333
both? And Jake Pickle. She and Jake were really 
good friends. The later, the congressman from the

02:28.486 --> 02:32.592
Austin area.

02:34.114 --> 02:35.997
Was she acquainted with Nellie? Yes. And then your 
parents meet when? Most can give you better

02:44.889 --> 02:47.253
details. My dad had an older brother. And who was 
about, dad was six years older than mother. And so I

02:55.955 --> 03:03.824
think that the story is that mother first saw dad's 
picture in an annual. But then after she finished

03:05.687 --> 03:10.793
at Texas, she wound up teaching in Brady where dad 
was coaching. So. Oh, now see, I'm glad you,

03:11.914 --> 03:17.421
because I had been told by somebody that they met 
when he was teaching and coaching and she was a high

03:18.683 --> 03:22.287
school student? No. I don't think so. So what was 
she teaching? Well, what would be the least thing

03:32.578 --> 03:36.383
you'd ever guess that she would teach? I don't 
know. P.E. P.E.? Oh, okay. And she took P.E., what

03:40.507 --> 03:47.475
is the story, something that her brother-in-law 
was a coach. And he said she didn't have to take math

03:47.810 --> 03:52.177
or a foreign language if she studied PE and it 
sounded fine. Right. Your dad was coaching and he

03:54.160 --> 03:57.525
was, what did he teach? I think they taught 
everything. Now this was at what high school? At

04:02.453 --> 04:02.994
Brady High School. At Brady. Uh-huh. And then he 
goes away to the war, comes back. He actually goes

04:09.203 --> 04:10.685
to Tarleton first. Oh, that's right. For Brady, he 
got appointed. In fact, I remember one time he said

04:14.571 --> 04:16.855
that was... That was the only job he really worked 
for. Oh. Was to get that coaching job at Tarleton.

04:24.658 --> 04:24.779
Right. Was he the head coach? Uh-huh. In football? 
Uh-huh. And was he doing that when the war started?

04:32.878 --> 04:33.700
Uh-huh. Oh. Oh. All right, and let's see, your 
memory is not yet there, is it? No, my brother, two

04:39.382 --> 04:45.350
years older, was born in Stephenville while they 
were at Tarleton. And then by the time I was born in

04:45.370 --> 04:52.240
1942, I was born at Brooke General, so he was 
already then in the service. Okay. And when your

04:54.503 --> 04:59.851
dad comes back from the service, where'd y'all 
live during the war? In Braden. Excuse me, uh-huh,

05:01.313 --> 05:04.257
in a little house on South Bridge Street. with the 
traffic light in town just outside the window. And

05:09.778 --> 05:13.544
the family consisted during the war of how many 
children? Just two. And that was when we became Bud

05:14.825 --> 05:20.814
and Sis because it was James Earl Jr. and my whole 
name is Margaret Ann. And that was too long to write

05:21.295 --> 05:25.801
on the little, what do they call the letters during 
the war? Email. Was it email? I started to say that.

05:29.486 --> 05:30.868
It was email. Female. Female. Female. That's it. 
Okay. Female. Okay, yeah. And so my brother at

05:34.922 --> 05:41.369
nearly 60 is still Bud Rudder, but I'm not cis 
anymore. But you were cis for a while. Well, in

05:43.191 --> 05:49.318
fact, until I left grade when I was 12, and all the 
family will still call me that. Oh, I can identify

05:49.979 --> 05:58.628
with that, because up in Garland, where I lived 
until I was 10, my dad was Hack, and I was Hack Jr.,

05:58.962 --> 06:00.123
Oh, really? To old-timers. Nobody gives 
nicknames anymore. Everybody used to have

06:04.308 --> 06:06.591
nicknames. Okay. You all move here. Do you recall 
your parents'

06:11.977 --> 06:17.783
unspoken feelings? Were they eager? Glad? What do 
you think was there? I think Mother was a little

06:23.790 --> 06:28.395
reluctant because she had longed to return to 
Austin, and she was really happy there.

06:35.926 --> 06:37.948
But it really wasn't questioned, it wasn't. And my 
dad was one that mother would often say that he

06:38.408 --> 06:49.620
doesn't, she would hear things from her friends 
about goings on on campus before she would hear

06:38.408 --> 06:49.620
from him. So he truly didn't talk about, Dad would 
never bring a pencil home from the office. So the

06:58.669 --> 07:05.015
fact that he didn't bring tails or events is really 
not a surprise. He very much,

07:05.936 --> 07:12.463
the office was office and home was home. You said 
you had not been here to visit. So the first time you

07:16.427 --> 07:23.695
come to College Station is when y'all are actually 
moving? And you moved into the big, old,

07:23.911 --> 07:28.195
Victorian... Wonderful, wonderful old house. 
All right, so you liked it from the first? Oh, from

07:31.958 --> 07:33.099
the very first. Make believe that I have never seen 
it. Describe it for me. It was two stories. It had

07:37.884 --> 07:42.368
great porches across the front on the first floor 
and the second floor. You walk inside and the

07:42.908 --> 07:52.517
carpet is deep maroon with a big staircase that 
goes up and a big grand piano underneath the

07:42.908 --> 07:52.517
staircase on the first floor. There's an 
elevator. Apparently one of the previous

07:55.285 --> 07:59.109
president's wives was an invalid. And this little 
elevator, there of course was not a shaft below the

08:00.010 --> 08:19.193
first floor, and the safety regulations were not 
in place so you could actually, if someone was

08:00.010 --> 08:19.193
upstairs coming down, you could open the door on 
the first floor and stand underneath and it would

08:00.010 --> 08:19.193
stop the pressure on your head. It just was 
wonderful. The grounds were beautiful, and it was

08:22.619 --> 08:30.451
just across from the chapel, the off-base chapel, 
and the fountain. And then to the east of it was

08:31.152 --> 08:34.236
Sabisa. Describe how many rooms down and up. Oh, 
there were three

08:40.245 --> 08:46.855
parlors, maybe two parlors. and a fireplace in one 
of the parlors and a fireplace in the study at the

08:47.510 --> 08:52.238
corner. And the study at the corner is where I spent 
most of it. Usually I was studying after everybody

08:58.027 --> 09:01.152
went to bed. And I kind of had it to myself down there 
in the fire. There was a huge dining room with a

09:04.938 --> 09:08.624
mural on the wallpaper. And you don't see perhaps 
how many? Oh, goodness, I don't know. I've got

09:12.269 --> 09:13.872
pictures of dinners that I brought girlfriends 
over, and I mean easily, more than a dozen, yeah,

09:14.341 --> 09:23.290
14, 16. Kitchen? Big kitchen, big kitchen, and 
there were always two people, always black, who

09:24.992 --> 09:33.900
were working there on campus. There would be a 
gentleman who would do the sweeping and lay the

09:33.940 --> 09:40.507
fires and outside things. Upstairs, how many 
vendors? Upstairs, one for my younger brother, a

09:44.142 --> 09:57.556
guest room, mother and dad's room, and then it had, 
there was a seating area off of that where the TV

09:44.142 --> 09:57.556
went. In these days of the TV in every room, that's 
kind of fun to remember. And then my two younger

10:02.341 --> 10:06.686
sisters shared a room, and then my room was at the 
very back. Now was there a basement? No basement.

10:09.330 --> 10:10.432
But there was a back stairs. Was an outdoor back 
stairs? No. An indoor back stairs? Uh-huh. There

10:14.461 --> 10:16.225
were two staircases inside. An attic? There was an 
attic. I don't remember because that's where the

10:19.933 --> 10:22.018
fire started. Oh, okay. That's where the fire 
started because of the mortar and the bricks.

10:28.845 --> 10:29.906
We'll get back to the fire. And this was the biggest 
house y'all ever lived in. Oh, goodness. I think

10:37.238 --> 10:40.504
all of our furniture fit in the upstairs. Was it 
fully furnished by the university? Downstairs it

10:45.652 --> 10:49.678
was, and I think even mostly upstairs. We didn't 
really have a whole lot. There were the five kids in

10:52.342 --> 10:56.528
our family.

10:57.749 --> 11:03.778
So when y'all arrived, your oldest brother was an 
A&M student. Actually, he must have been

11:04.298 --> 11:08.744
finishing his last year at Schreiner. So you're 
the oldest of the children at home. Yes. And you

11:13.691 --> 11:15.994
were a high school... Sophomore. Sophomore. And 
it wasn't my car, but mother and dad got a car. And it

11:21.281 --> 11:25.767
was maroon and white, and it was a little Dodge. And 
it was one of those that had the gear system that you

11:26.287 --> 11:31.374
sort of shifted but you didn't have to. There's a 
name for it. But that way then I could take my

11:34.018 --> 11:37.583
brothers, younger brothers and sisters to 
school. It was really never considered my car and I

11:38.485 --> 11:44.413
didn't take it to the University of Texas. But it 
was a car that I drove the kids in. So you then go to

11:47.657 --> 11:55.425
A&M Consolidated, then the high school building 
on Jersey Street, as we then named it, right across

11:47.657 --> 11:55.425
from the campus. What was it like for you adjusting 
to a new school? It was interesting hearing you

12:01.451 --> 12:05.536
talk about your son being a junior when you moved to 
El Paso. Because I thought when you were telling

12:06.137 --> 12:08.900
that, that's just about the age I was. Now, I moved 
from a much bigger school in Austin. here.

12:17.912 --> 12:21.757
I have the best feelings about the memories from 
then. Mother and Dad were made so welcome. I was

12:25.481 --> 12:26.623
made so welcome. Who were some of the people that 
deserve a note, a pat on the back for working on that

12:27.764 --> 12:34.493
welcome? Well, yeah, as far as Mother and Dad are 
concerned, the board, of course. The deans, all of

12:39.460 --> 12:42.784
the deans at the time, you know, the that group of 
deans and their wives were always wonderful. At

12:48.031 --> 12:52.599
the high school, Mr. Osment was the principal. 
That's O-Z-N-E-N-T. I think it was E-P Osment. I

12:58.849 --> 13:02.815
moved there, I moved there the middle of my 
sophomore year. By the end of the year, I'd been

13:03.267 --> 13:07.051
elected cheerleader and sophomore favorite. And 
I know that this was in part because of mother and

13:07.371 --> 13:12.737
dad. But I just was made, I was absolutely included 
and made welcome from the very beginning. And I

13:19.684 --> 13:26.291
remember somebody very important to me was Bob 
Boone, who was the choir director at the time at the

13:19.684 --> 13:26.291
high school. And he said, do you, you know, you've, 
okay, big deal. You've gotten yourself here and

13:30.516 --> 13:32.498
you've gotten elected. do you know the name of 
every student in the high school? I said, well, of

13:36.879 --> 13:39.084
course I don't. Don't be silly. He said, until you 
learn every name, you don't deserve the honor of

13:40.627 --> 13:46.037
representing them. So a lot of, yeah, I've just... 
And did anybody ever tease you that you'd come from

13:49.623 --> 13:56.852
Austin, from enemy territory or anything? Sure. 
Oh, okay. And even though I wound up going to the

13:58.674 --> 14:05.001
University of Texas, I was never really a 
flag-waving Longhorn. And those board members,

14:06.543 --> 14:14.753
you said, that welcomed your dad, are there any 
that you recall that really were at the top of the

14:15.475 --> 14:20.322
list of those who were most cordial, most 
welcoming? Oh, not that I can, you know, and I'm not

14:20.983 --> 14:33.341
sure that I could recall who was here when Dad first 
came, or then, you know, then later, you know,

14:20.983 --> 14:33.341
people like Mr. Quittenberg. But he was always 
very, very respectful of their position in

14:33.361 --> 14:41.694
relation to his position. Now, as I understand it, 
when he first came, His title was something like

14:45.412 --> 14:52.024
Executive Vice President for a brief time, and 
then he became President. Is that as you recall?

14:55.590 --> 15:06.390
So, as far as you recall, when your parents moved, 
he clearly understood that he was going to be the

14:55.590 --> 15:06.390
President. I just wasn't privy to those 
conversations. I just know that, in fact, I've

15:11.024 --> 15:26.644
said to my sons, I would wish for you the joy in 
whatever you choose to do, that you found the joy

15:11.024 --> 15:26.644
that my dad had in getting up and going to work every 
day. He got up, he walked two blocks down to the Koch

15:27.485 --> 15:36.597
building, and whenever he was done, he came home.

15:37.336 --> 15:42.661
I'm not sure what all he did there.

15:42.681 --> 15:47.426
But he did, he did love doing it. Were you aware, you 
said he didn't bring office problems home, were

15:47.907 --> 15:59.238
you aware as a child at home that his travel 
schedule sometimes was hectic? Oh sure, oh sure.

16:05.146 --> 16:05.847
Alright, let's see. Describe your reaction of 
being on the campus. Because you're here two

16:12.153 --> 16:14.236
years? Uh-huh, two and a half. Two and a half. 
Describe your reaction to living on the campus and

16:17.519 --> 16:21.063
living in this town. Well, I just have such fond 
memories. I can remember a couple of times. One

16:30.965 --> 16:35.231
time I can remember, just Dad and I were in the car 
going somewhere. And I said, you know, there's one

16:35.691 --> 16:38.615
thing that really bothers me. And I said, people 
have such expectations of me because of you. And I

16:44.543 --> 16:45.344
don't like it. And he said, well, you know, I 
understand how that can happen. And he said, maybe

16:55.597 --> 16:58.761
what you need to think about are all the good 
things. that have come to our family. And

17:00.470 --> 17:10.027
things you've gotten to do and places you've 
gotten to be that wouldn't have happened had we

17:00.470 --> 17:10.027
not. And let's see, I think you've mentioned to me 
before, you did not mind the thought of being a

17:10.688 --> 17:21.306
young lady living on the campus where there were 
all these young men. Dating was sort of

17:22.012 --> 17:30.760
interesting, because I could come in, and back 
then, you either dated the high school boys or you

17:22.012 --> 17:30.760
dated the A&M boys. You really couldn't date both. 
And my dad was very much a believer that if you're in

17:34.543 --> 17:39.667
high school, you date high school boys. And if I 
would date someone a year or two older who

17:40.048 --> 17:50.517
graduated, then I could no longer date him, 
because he was then an Aggie or whatever, or worse.

17:50.750 --> 17:58.119
So sometimes it'd be kind of funny, like if I was 
coming in, because you had to park at the side and

17:50.750 --> 17:58.119
then walk across the whole front of the house on the 
porch to get to the front door. And people would

17:58.799 --> 18:01.803
yell. And I can remember some girlfriends and I 
decided one weekend that we could sunbathe on the

18:02.103 --> 18:09.712
second floor. And nobody would know. Well, that 
wasn't the case either. We had, I guess, gotten the

18:14.105 --> 18:29.762
suntan stuff all over us and stretched out, and the 
first time we turned over, there was a whole row

18:14.105 --> 18:29.762
over across the street watching from the chapel 
grounds. There was a university policeman who was

18:31.844 --> 18:37.750
always stationed right at the corner of the, the 
fountain. And as I was always running a little

18:40.769 --> 18:48.123
late, out of the driveway and around that corner, 
he would always jump up on the curb. Do you remember

18:49.185 --> 18:54.996
any attempted student pranks around the 
president's house? No, no, and by the time some of

18:55.837 --> 19:01.487
the serious pranks that you hear about, I was 
already gone. No, I really don't. At that time, we

19:04.573 --> 19:13.930
always had the bulldog, and there was a place out by 
the garage that was a yard for the dog. When we first

19:15.332 --> 19:19.600
came here, girls were still wearing petticoats, 
adrenaline's. And I remember the horror of

19:19.883 --> 19:26.473
thinking that those were going to have to be hung 
out to dry in full view. But as it turned out, even

19:27.114 --> 19:35.127
kind of the laundry area was hedged so that it 
really wasn't in full view. But those are just some

19:35.628 --> 19:37.190
of the things. And Dad was always, you know, you 
just didn't step outside unless you were properly

19:37.310 --> 19:45.283
dressed or you didn't, you know. Things like that 
really were stressed. Now, could you have a bunch

19:48.125 --> 19:56.396
of high school friends over for a Friday night or 
Saturday night? Yeah, I could. They didn't always

19:58.659 --> 20:00.001
behave. I remember having a slumber party, and 
that was back in the baby doll pajama days, and some

20:02.024 --> 20:13.440
of my friends and my girlfriends ran outside to 
watch the boys march to breakfast. And I was like,

20:17.292 --> 20:28.086
And

20:17.292 --> 20:28.086
let's see, where did you and your high school 
friends go on a Friday night or a Saturday night for

20:17.292 --> 20:28.086
a good time? Oh, mostly we went to the school 
library and danced. And if it wasn't, you know,

20:32.432 --> 20:41.123
every ball game we always danced at the library and 
we decorated that afternoon. And if we didn't do

20:41.558 --> 20:44.722
that, we'd go to each other's houses. Manning 
Smith and Nita Smith, their son was in my class, so

20:44.782 --> 20:49.848
dancing was a big deal. I can remember going to the 
school parking lot, and the cars would all turn

20:50.269 --> 20:53.994
their lights on. We'd turn the music up and dance. 
So we did a lot of... Now, did high school kids in

20:56.817 --> 21:02.264
your day drink beer? Very few. I don't remember 
ever being around a beer in high school. Do you

21:07.350 --> 21:08.612
remember... and whiskey was hard to get in this 
county. So drunkenness was not a high school

21:12.344 --> 21:15.409
problem in those days. A few of the boys smoked 
cigarettes. That was kind of a big deal back then.

21:19.956 --> 21:24.943
And you hadn't even heard the words that we now know 
about the various drugs. No. Let alone, you hadn't

21:25.364 --> 21:26.625
seen it. I remember maybe like after my senior year 
of high school going to a party and coming in and And

21:34.732 --> 21:43.819
dad was always, he met me at the door downstairs 
when I came in, and as he was hugging me up the

21:34.732 --> 21:43.819
stairs, he was, you've been smoking cigarettes, 
sister. And I said, no, dad, I haven't. He said,

21:45.785 --> 21:49.095
somebody has drowned you. You know, it was, my 
sisters tell a funny story of even when they got

21:49.362 --> 21:57.655
into what we called the new house. And my sister was 
a few minutes late and came in and whoever her date

21:58.616 --> 22:08.631
was at the night thought he was being funny saying, 
and he just sort of yelled, said, hey Earl, we're

21:58.616 --> 22:08.631
home. Not knowing that dad, the window was open and 
dad yells out saying, fine, get her off. Oh, good,

22:16.744 --> 22:17.465
good. That's a good one. Now, any of those 
anecdotes for your life. Let's see, for you in high

22:22.618 --> 22:28.303
school, did you have certain hours you were 
expected to be in by? Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Well, of

22:30.165 --> 22:38.874
course, I went from high school to Littlefield 
Dorm at the University of Texas, and it was 10

22:30.165 --> 22:38.874
o'clock curfew there, and maybe 12 on the 
weekends. I'm sure my curfews were 9.30 or 10, and

22:40.235 --> 22:46.521
no dating during the week. When I first got here, 
Colonel Davis was here, and his son was two years

22:47.058 --> 22:53.105
older, Stedman Davis. And so Stedman and I kind of 
chummed up. We were both on campus. And I can

22:57.591 --> 23:07.463
remember when, just had been here a little while, 
and I came home from school, and he'd invited me to

22:57.591 --> 23:07.463
go get a Coke at Triangle. And I said, dad, Stephen 
Davis is downstairs. And my dad said, what in the

23:11.505 --> 23:16.500
hell is he doing here at this time of day? And by the 
time I got back downstairs, he wasn't. He was very

23:21.584 --> 23:26.851
strict on who my friends were. And were your grade 
reports checked by your parents? Oh, yes. That

23:33.400 --> 23:34.341
certainly sounds familiar. They both signed. Mom 
signed more than Dad. I still got them. But he

23:39.068 --> 23:42.132
always checked. I mean, unless they were all A's, 
it really wasn't acceptable. And there was no

23:46.178 --> 23:50.123
doubt that you were going to go to college. Oh, it 
was never a question. And the fact that you were

23:53.570 --> 24:01.059
female going to college had nothing to do with how 
important it was that you go. It wasn't. You know, I

24:03.301 --> 24:08.608
don't know who at 18 really directed toward a 
profession. And I remember talking to Dad. I loved

24:10.630 --> 24:11.631
to sew. I loved home ec courses. I loved kids. And so 
Dad said, well, you know, sister, just... go ahead

24:19.128 --> 24:20.350
and go to education. And that way, if you'd ever 
have to have something to fall back on. The thought

24:25.961 --> 24:31.973
of a career really just didn't exist in the late 
50s. As

24:31.993 --> 24:37.744
your dad becomes settled into his job, Who were the 
key people, as far as you know, that he turned to on

24:38.483 --> 24:47.794
the campus for, who were his key subordinates? Who 
did he rely upon? Well, you know about

24:50.277 --> 24:54.483
subordinates. I guess I think about Ed Cooper and 
Dorsey McCrory. Yeah, yeah. Tell me about those

24:57.626 --> 24:58.528
people. You might believe I didn't know anything 
about them. And I'm not sure at what point he's,

25:00.944 --> 25:07.150
see, they may have even started assisting him 
after I left. So. I just remember, I just remember

25:09.873 --> 25:17.440
their dedication. Yeah, Ed was his assistant. 
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. And I just remember him just

25:22.685 --> 25:27.790
always being there. Just...

25:32.686 --> 25:34.930
I don't know that I can tell you anything specific. 
We've carried on with the Coopers a lot. We've

25:39.197 --> 25:42.062
flopped babysitters back and forth. And my kids 
now babysat their grandkids. What about Dorsey

25:45.447 --> 25:48.092
McClure? And the same thing. Ed was so personable 
and so much fun. And he was, I don't know. I'm sure in

25:57.695 --> 26:00.300
a lot of respects he was sort of like a son to dad. 
Dorsey was more military. He was less personable.

26:08.233 --> 26:11.840
Had they met during the service, your dad and 
Dorsey? I have no idea. I have no idea. Because to

26:14.738 --> 26:20.304
me, Dorsey was less warm, more businesslike. Oh, 
the clerical, the secretary. Oh, Jerry Haught.

26:29.713 --> 26:30.374
Describe her.

26:33.397 --> 26:36.720
Jerry Haught and Nelda were just wonderful.

26:40.044 --> 26:41.185
Would they have dared... speak candidly to your 
dad if they thought he was about to, if the letter

26:41.857 --> 26:50.148
didn't say what it should have said? Dad was very 
well aware of his limitations in the King's

26:50.168 --> 26:54.393
English. And he very much appreciated how

26:55.655 --> 27:02.163
things looked. Some of the things when I... Dad was 
really strict, and he was less strict with the

27:06.325 --> 27:18.824
younger kids, but I've always said I love being one 
of the older ones because my relationship with him

27:06.325 --> 27:18.824
as an adult is just something I'd never trade for.

27:22.570 --> 27:30.543
I know he depended on them very much, and they were 
absolutely dedicated to him. I don't know what the

27:35.502 --> 27:38.328
formula was, or if it was just in the man. Do you know 
whether or not they were, were they there in the

27:38.729 --> 27:43.619
office when he? I don't know. I don't either. 
Because I'm thinking Nelda had to have been a

27:45.663 --> 27:51.435
rather young woman at that time. because this is 
now 40 years later. And she's still a young woman.

28:01.712 --> 28:04.917
Did you have any association with Wayne Hall? You 
know, I really didn't, and he has shared his

28:05.117 --> 28:09.424
writings with Mother. And she loaned them to me for 
a couple of days, and I didn't get through them, and

28:09.404 --> 28:16.095
she wanted them back. I want to read what he has 
written at some point. Let's go board members.

28:20.642 --> 28:22.084
They were then called board of directors. They 
weren't regents yet. Well, Doc Doherty was one,

28:23.426 --> 28:26.451
wasn't he? We need a list. We have a list I can tell 
you better. Sterling Evans, Zachary, Al Davies,

28:32.078 --> 28:39.929
Dick Goodson. You know, Al Davies had been Dad's 
roommate. Oh, I didn't know that. Yes. Do you know

28:44.716 --> 28:47.280
any anecdotes from that? When Al Davies' folks 
brought him to A&M, they opened the room that was

28:51.305 --> 29:00.918
assigned, and it was full of mops and brooms, and 
they thought surely they had been misdirected

28:51.305 --> 29:00.918
because that was obviously the custodial closet. 
But I think my dad at that point had the custodial

29:01.358 --> 29:04.482
concessions. Oh, they were lifelong friends. 
Because he would end up being the Sears and Roebuck

29:09.108 --> 29:14.675
CEO. And even Mildred, when I came back to Texas in 
1970 and... bought a Sears refrigerator. She came

29:24.319 --> 29:29.408
by to see the babies, and I said, well, you know, I 
bought a Sears refrigerator. She said, does it

29:29.428 --> 29:30.329
work? If it doesn't, send it back. Let's see. 
Another one of his classmates was a man named

29:36.720 --> 29:40.206
Teague. Can you share any examples of their 
relationship? Oh, gosh.

29:47.144 --> 29:50.828
I think they would have done anything in the world 
for one another. And were they close friends as

29:52.789 --> 29:55.953
undergraduates? Yes. So not only were they 
classmates, they were friends. Now Dad was older,

30:00.537 --> 30:08.325
because not only did he go to Tarleton for two years 
before coming here, but I think then he didn't, I

30:00.537 --> 30:08.325
think he had to lay out and work a year, too. So he was 
an older than average graduate when he left A&M.

30:14.030 --> 30:17.033
Oh, that one, let's digress a second. about a milk 
cow. Tell me your version of that story. Well, what

30:21.255 --> 30:28.283
I hear was that that was part of his stipend, was to 
bring the milk. And if the cow didn't provide, then

30:28.784 --> 30:35.952
he had to stop by the water fountain on the way to the 
mess hall. And that that was when one time when he

30:36.032 --> 30:45.163
was short on money and might have to drop out of 
school, that the coach came up with that idea. So I,

30:48.017 --> 30:50.183
okay. When dad left Eden, my father's father, 
mother said the other day, she said, well, my dad

30:50.203 --> 30:59.811
called your dad's dad a commission man. that he 
would, had you ever heard that term, a commission

31:00.719 --> 31:03.101
man? And you know, it's sort of like a broker. And he 
would broker land, or he would broker. On a

31:11.650 --> 31:12.190
commission. On a commission. And when Dad left, 
when Dad got the scholarship to Tarleton, he had a

31:14.573 --> 31:23.101
very good job as a soda jerk at the Eden drug store. 
And apparently my grandfather, Rudder, whom I

31:23.982 --> 31:29.427
never knew, that he died before Mother and Dad 
married, really didn't approve of Dad. He thought

31:31.803 --> 31:35.933
he was making a big mistake leaving that fine job at 
the drugstore. To go away. All right, now, your

31:37.056 --> 31:45.036
mother's family already owned the ranch?
