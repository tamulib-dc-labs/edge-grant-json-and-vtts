00:02.225 --> 00:10.315
Describe the role that the MSC played in getting students involved.

00:10.335 --> 00:25.173
Well, of course, with its many committees and programs, of course, the early ones were things like Town Hall and and later on came Opus and the political forum and those things.

00:26.795 --> 00:32.181
The main advantage of those programs is that it wasn't just to bring

00:32.785 --> 00:34.427
a speaker here.

00:34.447 --> 00:38.912
It wasn't just to have an entertainment venue going on at G. Raleigh White.

00:39.453 --> 00:58.675
The whole part of the program was what you did from deciding who was going to come, how you were going to invite them and get them here, and what it was going to take to fund and finance the operation, and then putting it all together and arranging the hall for it, arranging whatever

00:59.363 --> 01:13.182
accessories they needed for their performance, getting all this lined up, setting up ticket sales, all of this provided experience for students and it probably some of the most valuable training most of them ever had.

01:13.202 --> 01:16.666
A lot of them I'm sure had never done anything like this through high school.

01:17.607 --> 01:24.957
And if those MSC sponsored activities had not existed, what would student life have been like here?

01:25.658 --> 01:26.940
Pretty dull.

01:27.545 --> 01:33.815
I mean, just the simple fact that they had piano rooms that people could go play.

01:33.835 --> 01:48.557
One of the most enjoyable feelings I would get would be walking down the hall in the MSC and hearing some very talented pianist in there on that piano just relaxing and killing time, but doing something that made everybody else feel good.

01:49.972 --> 02:00.606
Uh, uh, when you, in those, uh, in the sixties, Guyon Hall was still here as our, what, what kind of events occurred at Guyon Hall?

02:01.261 --> 02:04.966
Well, Guyon Hall was still used for assemblies then.

02:05.847 --> 02:20.147
Most things didn't require G. Raleigh White, so various meetings of core units or even the whole core just about could fit into Guyon Hall.

02:20.127 --> 02:22.090
They had programs over there.

02:22.190 --> 02:23.793
They had movies over there.

02:23.853 --> 02:26.957
They would have talent shows each year over there.

02:26.977 --> 02:30.463
It was just a fun place to go.

02:30.883 --> 02:43.082
And the movies were a real kick because if a monster came on the screen, somebody would invariably jump up in the front row and yell, roommate!

02:43.683 --> 02:47.248
Or if a particularly

02:47.752 --> 03:03.448
unattractive actress or somebody came across the screen they would yell out something about how that was the girl my roommate dated last week or something like that and it's just

03:04.947 --> 03:07.630
It was a lot of fun and of course it was cheap entertainment.

03:08.011 --> 03:12.036
I don't remember what they charged then but it couldn't have been more than a buck or so to go to the movie.

03:12.897 --> 03:20.326
And it provided an avenue where you didn't have to try to find a ride to Brian because everybody didn't have a car back then.

03:21.167 --> 03:25.673
And there wasn't any bus transportation or anything like that to get around.

03:26.193 --> 03:31.919
Now, it was an almost all-male audience.

03:31.939 --> 03:32.059
Right.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.962
Were there things said that were obscene?

03:35.042 --> 03:49.957
Did anybody yell out things that were really... Well, I think generally there was very little obscenity going on, and if there was, usually they got shouted down pretty fast by everybody else, especially if there were ladies in the audience.

03:49.977 --> 03:51.559
And there was...

03:51.910 --> 03:56.978
a kind of an unwritten rule about decorum back then.

03:56.998 --> 04:12.781
And whether it was the military side of A&M or just most people's family upbringing, there was an understanding that there was just certain lines you didn't cross, especially if it was mixed company.

04:12.822 --> 04:16.467
But even if it wasn't, you didn't do things

04:17.172 --> 04:18.137
go on nowadays.

04:18.619 --> 04:24.027
Do you remember, we still had in those days, religious emphasis week.

04:24.749 --> 04:26.612
Do you remember attending any?

04:26.632 --> 04:27.032
Oh, yes.

04:27.213 --> 04:37.708
I was very active in the Wesley Foundation, but probably for all of the wrong reasons, it was another place to get away from the dorm and get away from the sophomores.

04:37.728 --> 04:47.483
But we would have Wesley Foundation every Wednesday evening, and usually on Sunday evening, we'd have some activities over there.

04:47.868 --> 04:53.636
At that time it was an old army barracks building pushed right up next to the A&M Methodist Church.

04:54.958 --> 04:59.104
And we would just have meals.

04:59.445 --> 05:01.808
Everybody would go over there and they'd pitch in to fix meals.

05:01.868 --> 05:05.474
And a lot of times the church ladies would help fix meals for us.

05:06.034 --> 05:08.458
And occasionally we'd have a program, but there were

05:08.810 --> 05:11.532
usually ping pong games and things like that to do.

05:12.253 --> 05:14.876
And again, it was just an escape.

05:15.896 --> 05:18.279
And this was not a place to me to date.

05:18.339 --> 05:19.820
These were all male.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.422
They were all male, pretty much.

05:22.502 --> 05:30.930
Now, when I came back in 62, they had built the new Wesley Foundation building across the street from the church.

05:31.030 --> 05:36.235
And we did have some young ladies who

05:36.552 --> 05:39.455
were at that time starting to come to A&M.

05:40.196 --> 05:47.265
And they participated in our programs, made it a lot nicer, gave you another reason to want to get over there.

05:48.026 --> 05:50.609
But we had a very, very strong program.

05:50.649 --> 05:52.811
Matter of fact, I was president of that group one year.

05:53.492 --> 06:02.863
And some of the relationships, as far as people I got to know in this area, some of the best ones were over there, Dottie and Earl Kniebel.

06:03.350 --> 06:06.074
were two of our sponsors for our group over there.

06:06.315 --> 06:18.775
And matter of fact, when I finally finished my degree in 66, Dottie had me and told me to invite a couple of friends over for kind of a congratulations dinner for graduation.

06:18.915 --> 06:20.858
And they were very close to us.

06:21.800 --> 06:26.808
I still see Earl talk to him, have talked to him a few times.

06:27.149 --> 06:29.172
Of course, he lost Dottie a few years back.

06:29.759 --> 06:34.807
But those kind of people, you know, just made all the difference in the world.

06:37.572 --> 06:39.074
You mentioned G. Riley White.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.944
Describe going to an Aggie basketball game in the 60s.

06:45.645 --> 06:47.929
Well, Shelby described it best.

06:47.989 --> 06:50.593
The Holler House on the Brazos.

06:50.733 --> 06:55.581
His teams back then, and even Bob Rogers before him,

06:56.725 --> 07:05.599
Pretty well filled the house, and with players like Carol Broussard and Benny Lennox and some of those, it was a lot of fun to watch Aggie basketball.

07:05.619 --> 07:10.827
They were very competitive, even if they weren't at the top of the league at that time, and several times they were.

07:12.289 --> 07:17.357
John Beasley came along at that period, even got to watch Randy Mattson play.

07:18.078 --> 07:24.488
And Randy says we're exaggerating, but I swear G. Riley White shook when he dove for a free ball.

07:25.008 --> 07:28.672
And every smaller player around him scrambled to get out of the way.

07:29.452 --> 07:32.195
But that was kind of a fun year.

07:32.275 --> 07:36.319
And we had a guy named John Reynolds, I believe, on the team back then.

07:36.379 --> 07:43.006
And it was real ironic that every time John Reynolds would go in, a fight would break out on the floor.

07:43.166 --> 07:47.711
And a few minutes later, John and the opposing leading scorer would be kicked out of the game.

07:49.332 --> 07:50.053
We'd...

07:50.422 --> 07:57.699
knew that Shelby would never condone anything like that, but it seemed like it happened like clockwork.

07:58.200 --> 08:03.733
Describe your view of Coach Metcalf then as a coach.

08:04.134 --> 08:09.426
Describe him in terms of personality and coaching style.

08:10.773 --> 08:15.879
I don't know that Shelby ever changed either one of those very much through the years.

08:15.960 --> 08:21.847
I mean, he's always been a very easy-going, kind of down-home sort of fella.

08:22.488 --> 08:32.500
And I still remember the game at Gregory Gym in Austin when some guy took a swing at one of his players at mid-court and the stands emptied.

08:33.261 --> 08:37.827
And Shelby told people afterwards that,

08:38.363 --> 08:40.485
ask him what did he do when the fight broke out.

08:40.505 --> 08:44.909
He said, the first thing I did was look to see where Benny Lennox was and make sure he wasn't in the middle of it.

08:45.250 --> 08:48.313
He says, and then I took out my comb and started playing the national anthem.

08:49.294 --> 08:51.596
So those were fun days.

08:51.836 --> 08:54.739
I was luckily high enough in the stands I couldn't get down to the floor.

08:59.163 --> 08:59.643
Let's see.

09:01.605 --> 09:02.867
Student leadership.

09:03.007 --> 09:06.430
In those days, what were the highest

09:07.085 --> 09:09.769
in terms of status among students.

09:10.170 --> 09:13.775
What were the highest student leadership positions?

09:15.197 --> 09:21.666
Well, of course, the Corps being what it was, I guess the Corps commander was one of the main leaders on campus.

09:22.768 --> 09:28.657
Student body president didn't have quite the stature that it does today.

09:28.817 --> 09:35.607
And at times, people seem to feel like

09:36.211 --> 09:48.243
The ones who got that job or got elected to it were sort of the darlings of Wayne Stark's MSC group, and they didn't have a whole lot positive to say about them.

09:48.303 --> 09:56.492
The student government got its start here, I believe, in the early 50s, I think it was when they got going.

09:57.332 --> 10:02.758
And it was starting to become more effective, I think.

10:03.380 --> 10:07.364
It was not the leadership role that it is today.

10:07.744 --> 10:09.306
What about band commander?

10:10.147 --> 10:18.755
Well, of course, we were in the army outfits on the north side, and nobody in the band meant very much to us.

10:19.436 --> 10:23.460
But, yeah, he had quite a bit of sway over in his area, I'm sure.

10:23.820 --> 10:27.163
MSC council president or whatever the title was?

10:27.604 --> 10:32.188
Well, those were viewed as very responsible positions, but...

10:32.641 --> 10:38.721
as far as exerting leadership over the campus, really I don't think they were viewed that way.

10:38.781 --> 10:41.771
Now they probably had a lot more influence than most of us thought about.

10:43.075 --> 10:45.503
And senior class president had been,

10:46.023 --> 10:51.772
weigh in earlier years a very respected position, but I don't think it was in the 60s.

10:52.353 --> 10:55.397
I don't think it was quite the same then.

10:55.457 --> 11:06.274
The main sway that those people had is oftentimes they were class officers at least, if not president of their class, all the way up.

11:07.135 --> 11:13.465
And so they already had a pretty good following of people by the time they achieved the presidency of their class as a senior.

11:13.951 --> 11:19.440
They might have been junior class president or treasurer or something and were known by a lot of people.

11:20.302 --> 11:24.369
Which were the most important student organizations as students thought of them?

11:26.413 --> 11:26.713
Well.

11:27.014 --> 11:27.735
Other than the Corps.

11:28.256 --> 11:32.723
I don't know if you'd call this an organization, but the Yale leaders were pretty highly thought of.

11:32.784 --> 11:39.435
And they were, you know, sort of special people to everybody.

11:42.588 --> 11:44.169
RVs, singing cadets?

11:46.291 --> 12:03.786
Well, I think to the average student on campus that those organizations were largely important to the people who were in them and that we, you know, we didn't feel like somebody being an RV meant any special thing to us.

12:04.247 --> 12:04.887
Or Yale Leader?

12:06.048 --> 12:07.490
Yale Leader was a little bit different.

12:07.510 --> 12:11.413
Yale Leader was in that, almost that celebrity kind of

12:12.001 --> 12:18.911
where if you could say you knew a Yale leader, you felt like you'd stepped up the ladder a little bit.

12:19.371 --> 12:25.901
And, of course, I felt real big because my freshman year, the head Yale leader was a senior from my hometown, a fellow named Joe Leaper.

12:26.061 --> 12:31.409
And so I felt pretty good when I carried him and dumped him in the fish pond.

12:31.449 --> 12:39.460
And also that reminds me, too, after the game that Charlie Milstead and Don Meredith,

12:39.710 --> 12:40.832
played against each other.

12:40.892 --> 12:42.957
Their last game was here on Kyle Field.

12:43.658 --> 12:47.787
And I remember being part of the group that went out and picked up Charlie Milstead.

12:48.528 --> 12:52.376
And we had him halfway off the field when he started tapping us on the head.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.819
And he, turn around, turn around, turn around.

12:53.839 --> 12:57.928
He made us take him back to the middle of the field and set him down where Don Meredith was.

12:57.948 --> 12:59.912
And they shook hands and walked off the field together.

13:00.770 --> 13:04.375
That was one of my big memories as a freshman.

13:04.415 --> 13:04.796
That is.

13:05.076 --> 13:08.902
Now, see, that's the special kind of thing we need.

13:09.162 --> 13:11.686
You talked about my association with A&M before.

13:11.766 --> 13:24.004
I forgot to mention that as a newspaper carrier, I won a free ticket to the A&M Rice game in 1955, which was the big come-from-behind victory that happened in the last two minutes of the game.

13:24.545 --> 13:29.933
I was up in the upper stands at Rice Stadium that day, and I mean, it made an impression.

13:30.487 --> 13:38.416
And it made such an impression that my junior year in high school, we had about 25 guys from my high school that were going to come to A&M.

13:39.978 --> 13:48.849
Before we graduated, Bear Bryant left, and three of us came here from my high school.

13:50.350 --> 13:58.620
One of them ended up finishing his degree at the University of Houston some years later, and the other one,

13:58.972 --> 14:01.238
I don't know if he ever went and finished his degree anywhere.

14:01.278 --> 14:04.185
I'm the only one out of my high school class that graduated up here.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.034
So I have a lot of fun when I go to my high school reunions.

14:08.135 --> 14:09.117
I'm the Aggie.

14:09.468 --> 14:18.178
Let's see, you didn't have a car those first years.

14:18.599 --> 14:21.663
How did you get back and forth from home?

14:21.683 --> 14:23.845
Well, mostly catching rides.

14:23.905 --> 14:34.598
There were some people that did have cars, of course, and if they were freshmen, they got to park in the Navasota and later in the Hempstead lot out on the south side of campus.

14:35.472 --> 14:43.603
We had, there was a bulletin board up in the MSC and over in the YMCA where people posted notices of rides.

14:43.683 --> 14:47.809
If you wanted to ride or if you wanted to give people a ride, you put a note up there.

14:48.370 --> 14:51.735
And then people got in touch with you and you worked it out.

14:52.215 --> 14:56.581
But we had a lot of folks from my hometown area down there that went back and forth.

14:56.621 --> 14:59.025
So it was pretty easy to catch a ride most weekends.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.129
Hitchhiking had stopped by and large.

15:02.149 --> 15:03.511
Hitchhiking was still going on.

15:03.531 --> 15:04.973
I hitchhiked at home.

15:05.138 --> 15:10.746
in as many as 20 rides and as few as one from the east gate of A&M.

15:11.707 --> 15:29.712
And caught rides with the fellow who designed the new College Station High School back then, who later was one of the main parties in starting the architecture firm that became Caudill, Rowlett, and Scott, that later became

15:29.894 --> 15:32.416
the big 3D firm that exists today.

15:32.737 --> 15:35.459
It evolved into that along with other companies.

15:36.420 --> 15:44.708
But he and I had a very nice visit, and if I'm not mistaken, he did design work on my high school in Texas City that I graduated from.

15:44.748 --> 15:49.052
I was the first high school class to graduate from that new high school in Texas City.

15:49.212 --> 15:57.100
Now, was there an especially good place for an Aggie to catch a ride in the Houston area?

15:58.801 --> 16:04.529
Well, I rarely was trying to hitchhike out of Houston.

16:04.609 --> 16:10.498
I mean, if I was hitchhiking in Houston, it was from generally wherever I got let off by somebody else.

16:10.578 --> 16:13.241
So I wasn't looking for any particular place.

16:13.502 --> 16:19.290
The worst place to try to hitchhike was between here and Huntsville, unless, unless,

16:19.507 --> 16:26.977
You're in the early evening when all the Aggies are going that way and that's where you're going or you're late at night and you're coming this way and all the Aggies are coming back.

16:27.458 --> 16:30.962
Any other time of day, you do a lot of walking out there.

16:30.982 --> 16:37.811
Was it easier to get a ride for a student here in uniform or out of uniform?

16:39.133 --> 16:43.979
Back in those days, I think it was probably a lot of people would stop for somebody in uniform.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.763
And I think a lot of those people probably felt

16:47.587 --> 16:54.561
who weren't really familiar with A&M probably thought we were Army and got an education after we got in the car with them.

16:54.581 --> 16:58.849
Did you ever have a bad experience hitchhiking while you were a student here?

16:59.370 --> 17:03.518
Oh, I got into some pretty crowded, smelly cars a time or two.

17:03.538 --> 17:08.768
I don't remember any particularly bad experiences except some of them that

17:09.457 --> 17:14.283
took me only a short distance and then let me out in the middle of nowhere where there was hardly anybody coming by.

17:14.964 --> 17:16.566
But they didn't do that deliberately?

17:16.586 --> 17:16.786
No.

17:16.987 --> 17:19.850
That just happened to be where they were turning off.

17:19.870 --> 17:22.434
And they never tried to take advantage of you in any way?

17:22.514 --> 17:23.515
No.

17:23.595 --> 17:24.717
Most of them very pleasant.

17:24.797 --> 17:36.612
And I think there was one time I drove a car for somebody because the older gentleman said, you know, he was getting a little bit tired and he'd been riding for a while and he liked a spell.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.601
I never did get a ride like my brother did once.

17:39.641 --> 17:47.195
He claims that he was on the Gulf Freeway going south toward Galveston, and this convertible pulled over with two girls in it.

17:48.338 --> 17:51.383
And he got in with them, and they started heading down there.

17:51.443 --> 18:00.861
He found out they were secretaries working in Houston, and he said that they asked him, you know, why didn't he just come on to Galveston with them?

18:01.347 --> 18:04.850
He told them, he said, no, no, I've really got to get home.

18:04.890 --> 18:06.232
I've got something I've got to get home for.

18:06.452 --> 18:09.555
And my mother asked me, said, I brought you up better than that.

18:14.099 --> 18:16.942
How often did you and your buddies go to Bryan?

18:18.524 --> 18:19.925
Not real often.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.748
Probably more when I came back.

18:22.808 --> 18:30.055
Now, we went as outfit groups a time or two to Wormans Cafe on the north side of Bryan.

18:30.743 --> 18:34.109
It was either that or the movie theaters was about all we went in for.

18:34.149 --> 18:36.312
Matter of fact, that was about all that was there at that time.

18:37.174 --> 18:47.751
And when I came back as a civilian student, we had cars, some of us then, and we would often go in to eat at Wormans or other restaurants in the Bryan area.

18:48.472 --> 18:56.886
And as far as how often, I would say we probably drove in there maybe once or twice a week.

18:57.541 --> 18:58.423
At that time.

18:58.965 --> 19:05.441
When you and your buddies wanted to have a good time on a Saturday night, where did you go and what did you do?

19:07.566 --> 19:14.925
Well, I remember one night that we hit about four or five bars in Bryan.

19:15.817 --> 19:24.769
And found out the next day that we were one step ahead of the Liquor Control Board agents because they had gone to every one of them that night apparently right after we had.

19:25.010 --> 19:27.593
And they had picked up some people that were underage.

19:27.653 --> 19:31.619
And, of course, most of the time we had people with us that were underage.

19:33.441 --> 19:36.806
And at those places did you all buy beer?

19:37.968 --> 19:38.769
Yes, usually.

19:38.789 --> 19:43.275
And sometimes danced, depending on who was there.

19:43.559 --> 19:50.368
Was there any, do you remember any routine check then to ensure that you were the legal?

19:51.129 --> 19:53.172
By the bartender?

19:53.192 --> 19:56.176
Fairly cursory and most any kind of ID would get by.

19:57.577 --> 20:03.846
They didn't have the threat of legal suits if somebody got in a car wreck after being there or anything like they do nowadays.

20:04.807 --> 20:10.875
How often did you encounter people that were clearly drunk?

20:11.376 --> 20:13.178
There were usually some, usually...

20:13.613 --> 20:15.835
At least one in our group probably was.

20:16.916 --> 20:22.181
And how often did somebody that you knew go to Whiskey Bridge?

20:23.643 --> 20:29.568
Oh, on every major weekend when there was a big dance or anything like that going on, they usually sent somebody down there.

20:29.608 --> 20:37.556
I imagine there were some people who went more often than that, but usually on major event weekends, they sent the car down there.

20:38.036 --> 20:39.137
Oh, in bonfire time.

20:39.998 --> 20:42.000
We loaded up one year on a

20:42.284 --> 20:59.964
a case of half pint bottles of Thunderbird wine and went out to the bonfire cutting area and we'd go out and pick up a log and haul it in and put it on the truck and we'd reach in our back pocket and take a swig and we'd go out and pick up another log and bring it back in.

21:00.065 --> 21:09.135
All these other guys would bring a log in and they'd throw it on the truck and then they'd collapse on the ground for about 30 minutes and we brought in, I don't know, probably

21:09.318 --> 21:13.845
five or six times as many logs as any other group out there, and we were feeling no pain at all.

21:15.287 --> 21:19.273
If they'd ever figured it out, I think we'd have been in real trouble, but nobody did.

21:20.095 --> 21:32.193
About the worst thing that happened to me out there was losing a tennis shoe in the mud and losing my dad's car keys that I had forgotten to take out of my pocket when I came back home from home one weekend.

21:33.535 --> 21:37.401
Luckily, he had a spare, but he never let me in the end of that.

21:37.651 --> 21:38.893
You mentioned bonfire.

21:39.374 --> 21:44.021
Describe the bonfire routine in your student years.

21:44.041 --> 21:50.272
Well, it was pretty much parceled out to different outfits to do different things.

21:50.392 --> 21:59.727
I mean, we were generally always assigned to the cutting area, and except for guard duty occasionally after they were building the bonfire stack,

22:00.247 --> 22:03.011
Most of us never worked around the stack.

22:03.411 --> 22:12.103
There were certain units designated to move logs around the stack and of course they were still using block and tackle a lot then.

22:12.123 --> 22:18.411
I think they had a crane but they still lifted a lot of logs up on the stack with block and tackle.

22:18.732 --> 22:23.839
So it was a different type of operation and very, very well organized.

22:23.939 --> 22:26.582
I mean they had one unit who was on a rope to pull.

22:26.602 --> 22:28.825
They had another unit who was bringing logs in.

22:28.906 --> 22:29.967
They had a crew that was

22:30.436 --> 22:34.322
to tie up the log, to get it ready to lift up there.

22:34.702 --> 22:37.066
I mean, it was pretty well spelled out.

22:37.126 --> 22:39.950
It was like a Ford Motor Company operation.

22:40.230 --> 22:43.455
You did this and they did that and they did that and it got built.

22:44.016 --> 22:47.461
Were there other units who were primarily assigned only to the cutting area?

22:48.322 --> 22:48.623
Yes.

22:49.243 --> 22:54.691
There were a lot of units assigned to the cutting area because that was probably where you spent your largest amount of time.

22:55.212 --> 22:59.278
Once they were brought to the stack area, I mean, it was only,

22:59.596 --> 23:03.280
short distance carries to move logs to get them ready to go on the stack.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.922
We were often carrying logs through the woods.

23:06.843 --> 23:19.836
I guess if you used city blocks, we would probably carry logs sometimes, I don't know, six, eight blocks distance to get them to where the trucks were picking them up.

23:19.856 --> 23:28.725
If they could, they'd bring the trucks in closer, but a lot of times you had to get the ones that were farther out there and there were no roads cut through in some places.

23:28.874 --> 23:32.260
About how many people would lift a log and carry one log?

23:33.182 --> 23:42.639
Well, it depended a little on the log, but you line people up with their shoulder to the log just about solid.

23:42.679 --> 23:49.752
I mean, as much space as you had for somebody to stand in front of you and somebody to stand behind you and you get room on it.

23:50.153 --> 23:52.095
They used the cross sticks.

23:52.716 --> 23:53.857
You know what those were called.

23:55.059 --> 24:09.696
And you'd line up on each stick would probably, again, depending on the log, you might have three or four or five people on each side of the main log lifting on the stick to lift it up between them.

24:10.757 --> 24:15.182
And when they'd get to the unloading place,

24:15.635 --> 24:23.683
What they would do was the people with the sticks on one side would be directed to lay the end of their stick down on the ground while the other people held theirs up.

24:24.443 --> 24:28.007
And these people would hold onto the log to keep it from rolling.

24:28.507 --> 24:34.653
And then at the given command, they would let go and duck under the log and let it roll on down onto the ground.

24:35.374 --> 24:45.523
And then they'd use similar means of stacking timber up next to the truck.

24:45.908 --> 24:49.113
and they would roll them up that to get them on the truck.

24:49.814 --> 24:51.616
Nowadays, I don't know what they do out there.

24:51.656 --> 24:57.365
They got everything from forklifts to small cranes that are picking them up and moving them out there.

24:57.385 --> 25:01.751
And about when did the bonfire cutting start in the fall?

25:03.113 --> 25:06.718
Seemed like it was about the beginning of October.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.835
that we would start having some cutting.

25:10.055 --> 25:15.100
And it would go on primarily on weekends throughout October.

25:15.780 --> 25:20.885
And then it would probably pick up pretty solidly during the early part of November.

25:20.945 --> 25:26.330
And by mid-November, I think they usually tried to have all the logs cut and hauled to the site.

25:26.970 --> 25:29.613
And then from then on, it was working over at the stack.

25:29.793 --> 25:33.857
And the terminology of red pots and all that was already there or not?

25:33.957 --> 25:35.558
Red pots, I'm not sure.

25:36.078 --> 25:45.588
I guess they had brown pots and yellow pots and green pots and whatever they got now, but I don't remember much of anything except the red pots being in charge.

25:45.728 --> 25:53.196
And the bonfire itself was held in the area behind Duncan, south of Duncan Hall.

25:53.256 --> 25:53.477
Yes.

25:54.598 --> 25:57.201
The same field where the A&M Press Building is to that.

25:57.281 --> 26:00.284
And where the band practiced then, did it?

26:00.304 --> 26:00.524
Oh, yes.

26:01.545 --> 26:05.089
Do you remember any particular injuries that occurred?

26:07.027 --> 26:11.892
Well, I think there were a lot of cuts and scrapes and stuff like that, nothing real serious.

26:12.052 --> 26:34.553
Of course, several years before I got here, a fellow named James Saran was killed in an accident, and a fellow was talking to me about it this last weekend, said he went back and looked up the story, and he said the story in the paper then said something about some UT students were trying to get to the bonfire, and he was,

26:34.887 --> 26:52.364
out with the guarding group or out near the cutting area but it was along the roadway or highway and that he was standing in front of a truck and somehow the truck either let go or came down the hill and caught him between that and another truck.

26:53.085 --> 26:57.229
And that's the only fatality that I know happened back in that era.

26:57.249 --> 27:03.375
The only other one John Adams says was the plane crash which was

27:03.828 --> 27:17.605
A Navy flyer who had at one time been a student at A&M was showing off and buzzing the bonfire stack and lost control of his aircraft or something and crashed to the other side of the tracks.

27:17.625 --> 27:20.031
Were you here in the fall of 60?

27:22.222 --> 27:24.405
Let's see, Kennedy assassination in 62.

27:24.665 --> 27:29.853
No, I was laying out of school working in Houston at that time, so I wasn't part of any of that.

27:29.873 --> 27:33.718
That year that we canceled the bonfire.

27:35.140 --> 27:39.747
Looking back on it, of what value is bonfire to Aggie students?

27:41.309 --> 27:52.144
Well, I think, of course, the value originally to most of us, I think, was the emotional feeling and stuff we got when it was set off

27:52.613 --> 27:54.535
on the night before Thanksgiving.

27:54.636 --> 28:00.483
And I think to a lot of us that was really all it was.

28:00.803 --> 28:04.908
I think we probably felt like kind of indentured servants as far as building it.

28:04.948 --> 28:06.911
We didn't have a whole lot of choice in all of that.

28:07.872 --> 28:12.758
I think it has grown into something now that has a lot more going for it.

28:13.599 --> 28:16.283
Now, I don't know if they exaggerate the figures or not.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.165
It seems to me they quote figures

28:19.276 --> 28:29.552
a lot higher than the number of people that may really be working on Bonfire and I think they're counting everybody from support personnel who bring cookies and coffee and things like that.

28:30.553 --> 28:48.000
I wish more people could be involved in it because I think they would have a greater appreciation for it but it does provide a good leadership laboratory and apparently that hadn't been as good a leadership laboratory as we'd like it to be after the incident last fall.

28:48.318 --> 28:55.350
When you were working on the bonfire, did many people work on it after, say, their sophomore year?

28:56.592 --> 28:58.776
I think it kind of dwindled off.

28:59.056 --> 29:11.558
If I remember the seniors and the juniors in the Corps, the juniors were still pretty much kind of required to be over there, but they were in leadership positions, mostly just directing crews and things like that.

29:12.854 --> 29:14.459
A few would stay involved.

29:14.780 --> 29:21.000
The majority would stroll around there once in a while and kind of throw their weight around, but I don't think a lot of them.

29:22.083 --> 29:26.256
It became pretty much of a freshman and sophomore deal.

29:27.147 --> 29:36.619
for the most part, and I guess that's why every freshman class considers the bonfire they build their freshman year their bonfire, not the one that burns their senior year.

29:37.641 --> 29:43.408
What were the dimensions on the bonfires you remember in your student days, in terms of how many stacks and so forth?

29:43.548 --> 29:51.619
Well, of course, it was back right after I was here that they set the record for 107 or 109 feet tall.

29:52.156 --> 29:54.698
I think that was primarily the center pole.

29:54.718 --> 29:58.121
I don't know if the stack itself ever got that high, but they counted that.

29:59.483 --> 30:00.203
It was up there.

30:00.323 --> 30:06.289
I would say the stacks when I was here were probably, I don't know, 60, 65 feet tall.

30:07.270 --> 30:09.692
And so how many stacks would that have been?

30:10.332 --> 30:12.254
Oh, they had as many as six, I think.

30:13.015 --> 30:13.876
Okay.

30:13.956 --> 30:20.001
I took a picture once from a crane over on Duncan Field looking down on the top of the stack.

30:20.281 --> 30:22.163
I've got those somewhere in my attic, too.

30:23.527 --> 30:28.355
Campus personalities.

30:28.856 --> 30:29.818
Pinky Downs.

30:30.379 --> 30:30.800
Oh, yeah.

30:31.481 --> 30:32.422
Describe him.

30:32.563 --> 30:48.370
Now, Pinky was one of the ones that met us when we were freshmen, and you'd run into him in the MSC or different places on campus, and he'd regale you with all of these stories about how things were when he was a student, and he just was helping everybody have a good time.

30:48.670 --> 30:54.001
He carried the title of unofficial greeter back then, and he was just a fixture.

30:54.082 --> 30:55.906
He was just somebody you enjoyed being around.

30:55.966 --> 30:57.569
Describe him physically.

30:57.629 --> 31:04.063
Small, thin gentleman, wasn't big at all.
