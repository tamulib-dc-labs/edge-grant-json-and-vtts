WEBVTT

00:02.967 --> 00:11.020
Actually, my first class and checking the roll, and I came to this name and I said, Mizzle.

00:12.943 --> 00:17.410
And the young man stood up in uniform and said, it's Mizell, sir.

00:19.113 --> 00:20.315
I'm sorry, Mr. Mizell.

00:20.655 --> 00:21.917
Okay.

00:21.937 --> 00:24.942
And there were quite a few of those along the way.

00:25.546 --> 00:30.873
I very often had to repeat some of my phrases.

00:32.355 --> 00:36.361
Those are the most difficult ones that one trips over.

00:37.042 --> 00:44.152
And, of course, I had to ask many of the students to tell me what it was they were actually talking about.

00:47.957 --> 00:53.224
As these misunderstandings, pun intended, as those misunderstandings occurred,

00:53.727 --> 00:56.834
Was it always with a smile on the student's part?

00:57.174 --> 00:57.916
Oh, yes.

00:57.936 --> 01:03.688
They took it in very good vein, and I hope that I did in exactly the same.

01:04.189 --> 01:07.717
We will chuckle about this, especially after the class was over.

01:08.639 --> 01:12.968
These students were almost always majors in meteorology?

01:13.420 --> 01:42.550
Yes, we had very few service courses as such because being a small number in the faculty we were kept very busy with trying to teach all the courses for the meteorology majors because they were at that time able to award all three degrees in meteorology so it was very wide-ranging.

01:42.985 --> 01:53.496
more than likely the first entry level student in meteorology, did he take a freshman course or a sophomore?

01:53.516 --> 02:08.432
Generally, and this was something that we have tried to alter through the years, basically he didn't get any significant amount of meteorology until his junior year.

02:08.552 --> 02:10.174
Junior year.

02:11.943 --> 02:40.937
some would take a course in the second semester of their sophomore year and we have tried to alter that and now this is done so that we get to know the students and we still have a large percentage dropout in the first couple of years because the students especially

02:42.267 --> 03:07.870
since about the early 70s have tended to come in and think that the meteorologist stands in front of a map on the TV and just points out this thing that seems very glamorous and when they learn that they have a whole host of mathematics and physics courses some of them find this is a bit too much but we do get

03:08.322 --> 03:17.174
about an equivalent number transferring in from fundamentally engineering coming in.

03:17.374 --> 03:24.423
So that holds the enrollment about level at that time and they have got the maths and physics.

03:25.825 --> 03:28.288
In nomenclature

03:28.825 --> 03:32.348
What courses were you teaching in the early years?

03:32.969 --> 03:42.697
I was teaching the two climatology courses, the statistical ones and the instrumental ones.

03:43.738 --> 03:58.090
Use of instruments not only in meteorology as we envision it in the upper atmosphere and so on, but also of course instrumentation which is specialized for what we would now say is the environment.

03:58.357 --> 04:28.347
that wasn't such an in-word at the time that we came along because while I'd been over here in the USA I had worked with a professor in biology in Emory University, Dr. Robert Platt and yes just the time I got here my first book came out in environmental measurement and interpretation we co-authored it

04:28.327 --> 04:50.511
so that we used, you know, information from there to convey to the students the differences between instrumentation for the upper atmosphere and for pure meteorology, if there is such a word, such an animal as this, and environmental meteorology.

04:51.552 --> 04:57.118
How long after you arrived, how long was it before you began to direct graduate students?

05:00.052 --> 05:02.095
I think it was one year, one year, yes.

05:02.275 --> 05:10.747
I think my first student got his degree, a master's degree in 64.

05:11.868 --> 05:12.729
Yes, I came in 62.

05:13.030 --> 05:22.944
And I never knew what a trail it was taking, and when I graduated my last one this May, he was the 81st.

05:22.964 --> 05:23.424
81st?

05:24.466 --> 05:26.268
Graduate student that I chaired.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.371
Oh, my goodness.

05:28.486 --> 05:36.337
Well, in mentioning that, give some examples of where they are now that causes you to be very proud.

05:36.558 --> 05:37.960
Where are some of your products?

05:39.462 --> 05:43.327
Well, I'm sort of embarrassed to say that some of them have already retired.

05:44.489 --> 05:48.374
Some of them beat me to it because I enjoyed what I was doing so much.

05:48.815 --> 05:54.443
But quite a few of them, as you would believe, are up.

05:54.423 --> 06:07.222
in the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville and actually they span almost, I like to think of, three generations of my students up there.

06:08.003 --> 06:12.009
Some of the senior ones are in major positions.

06:12.730 --> 06:19.080
In fact we had one who has just retired from being director but

06:21.136 --> 06:24.239
He was not my student at the time.

06:24.319 --> 06:28.744
He was getting his PhD in the early 60s when I was here.

06:30.566 --> 06:45.321
But many of them are section leaders up there, and they're a married couple, both of whom have just joined the NCDC, as it's known, group.

06:45.892 --> 06:58.013
as meteorologists there and climatologists, and then also a number of the military people have gone on very high.

06:58.374 --> 07:01.960
My last PhD student graduated about a year ago,

07:01.940 --> 07:09.927
He is now also located in the same building as the NCDC and he's just made lieutenant colonel.

07:11.449 --> 07:28.825
And then I have another student way back who is in charge of the meteorological section of the testing out in Las Vegas in Nevada

07:29.581 --> 07:36.028
various military equipment and so he's director of that.

07:36.068 --> 07:48.120
Another student went to Cargill, the agricultural pesticides people sort of thing, and built that up and became leader.

07:48.180 --> 07:55.588
He was the first meteorologist they took on as far as I was aware and

07:55.568 --> 08:04.305
I think he's just about retired now and he went and built this up until it's now quite a big section of their company.

08:05.266 --> 08:07.070
And others are all over the world.

08:07.130 --> 08:18.792
There was a Greek student who became a general and leader of the Greek Meteorological Service, the first one who got a degree in meteorology here.

08:19.328 --> 08:34.468
We had quite a problem there because he just had a diploma when coming here and I had to speak up for him for being permitted to go on to a graduate degree with just a diploma.

08:35.039 --> 08:39.667
But I'm always a great believer in, well, let's give these people a try.

08:39.707 --> 08:41.089
It doesn't cost us anything.

08:41.369 --> 08:44.154
And if they sink, well, that's very bad.

08:44.354 --> 08:49.443
But if they swim, which they all have done, good for them.

08:50.304 --> 08:58.718
And then I had the first two PhDs in meteorology

08:58.698 --> 09:16.977
from Saudi Arabia they've gone back as heads of their sections and in the universities and so I keep check of keeping contact with about 30 of the 80.

09:18.019 --> 09:22.263
Many women in meteorology?

09:22.844 --> 09:25.026
Interesting point a very very

09:25.985 --> 09:51.351
difficult question in a way because there was the attempt especially a number of years ago to try to get more women in and it was very very difficult basically the women didn't want to go into this and we still have just a minority and we had

09:53.407 --> 10:09.701
Our first masters, I don't have a note of it here, student was, female was in the 80s and in the late 80s for the PhD, two women graduated together in a year.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.006
So

10:11.986 --> 10:14.430
A very small number now.

10:14.590 --> 10:30.175
Now in what have grown to be the service courses that I taught, namely Agricultural Meteorology and Architectural Meteorology, there were sometimes as many as a third, 40% would be women.

10:31.237 --> 10:36.525
And I always found them very, very dedicated students.

10:36.725 --> 10:38.968
And they would be majoring in what?

10:39.369 --> 10:49.162
In architecture, environmental design, in agriculture, it could be almost anything, entomology, wildlife, soil and crops, this sort of thing.

10:50.264 --> 11:06.006
And I always used to say to my wife that when I had about 30% women in the course, I could put a bet on the first two at the end would be women.

11:06.391 --> 11:07.873
In terms of their grades?

11:07.893 --> 11:08.374
Of their grades.

11:08.394 --> 11:11.017
They would be first and second.

11:11.378 --> 11:19.169
Do you remember any amusing events regarding a woman being in the class?

11:20.110 --> 11:22.954
Did anything change for the male students?

11:25.998 --> 11:35.672
Since the women were nearly always in a minority, I don't know what was going on in the male thoughts, but

11:37.272 --> 11:39.659
I didn't notice anything about this.

11:39.699 --> 11:49.628
One thing I must mention was that in the earlier years there was more

11:50.755 --> 12:01.268
courtesy towards the women, that especially a military student would open the door and let her out.

12:01.288 --> 12:08.878
Now is just as likely to let, not the military I'm saying, would let the door slam in her face as she's walking up to it.

12:09.459 --> 12:12.382
And that was something.

12:12.643 --> 12:14.124
What about minority students?

12:14.205 --> 12:20.172
Did they end up taking meteorology courses about the same percentage as others?

12:21.620 --> 12:22.562
Very few.

12:22.582 --> 12:24.705
We've had very few.

12:24.745 --> 12:40.371
We have had, of course, in recent years, more from the Asiatic community, and almost without exception, they have been very, very dedicated students.

12:40.705 --> 12:54.192
We have had a number of Latin American students, Spanish being the natural language, first language.

12:54.728 --> 13:20.922
as far as Afro-Americans are concerned I'm just trying to think we've had one young lady who's gone on to be on the CNN weather and she was in one of my classes and we've had just a handful

13:22.977 --> 13:34.488
seldom more than two in a class of perhaps eighty or so of Afro-Americans in service courses that I have taught.

13:34.508 --> 13:38.592
There may be some exceptions to this.

13:38.612 --> 13:49.963
Now, the tip here in your more than thirty years, well beyond thirty years, the typical undergraduate major in meteorology

13:51.884 --> 13:56.853
arrives as a freshman planning to major in meteorology or transfers?

14:01.342 --> 14:11.361
Without any numbers to back this, and this sends a shudder down the spine of a statistician, I would say that about 60% of them have come in

14:11.915 --> 14:19.169
and worked through, and perhaps about forty percent would have come this engineering or perhaps physics route or something like that.

14:19.609 --> 14:25.801
So that most of the transfers come from a science-based discipline.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.065
Oh yes, yes, definitely.

14:28.446 --> 14:34.497
Is there, does, geographically, are they urban youngsters or country youngsters?

14:35.540 --> 14:43.196
Mainly, they have come from Houston or Dallas, Dallas-Fort Worth.

14:43.216 --> 14:43.938
So urban.

14:44.098 --> 14:45.100
Yes, definitely.

14:46.082 --> 14:53.498
The international students tend to be from any particular part of the world?

15:00.413 --> 15:01.835
Not in particular.

15:01.855 --> 15:04.740
I have had them from Africa.

15:04.900 --> 15:10.428
The African students usually have moved towards me because they know I spent many years in Africa.

15:11.369 --> 15:17.038
And then these Saudi Arabian students have come.

15:17.018 --> 15:28.371
We have had students from India, Greece, as I mentioned earlier, and others that have a Latin American background.

15:29.973 --> 15:41.126
But nowadays, I'd have to put the emphasis on Korea and China, that we are getting many more students from those parts of the world.

15:41.146 --> 15:42.908
Is there a particular reason for that?

15:43.462 --> 15:47.407
Do you all have some special connection with those countries?

15:51.212 --> 15:52.033
Not really.

15:52.073 --> 16:07.292
I think that what has happened when the Chinese had the opportunity to get out, and students would write to just about every university, I think,

16:07.272 --> 16:31.288
and if we had monies available and no US citizen applying for these jobs with those capabilities then we would invite those over they were very dedicated we had a number of people

16:33.142 --> 16:57.259
Coming over for short periods, I had one professor coming over for two semesters from a university there, an agricultural meteorologist, and his requirement was to get two published papers so that he would go back and become a full professor.

16:57.728 --> 17:00.532
We managed to do that, but he didn't earn a degree.

17:01.193 --> 17:04.457
But that was the sort of pattern.

17:04.537 --> 17:12.248
I think that in Korea it was more that they did have some money and support from the government in order to be able to come over.

17:13.469 --> 17:15.873
But that has tended to dry up now.

17:17.094 --> 17:20.819
Describe your teaching technique.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.483
How do you teach a course?

17:25.420 --> 17:33.652
What I try to do is first of all introduce them to what we are trying to do.

17:33.672 --> 17:54.043
If I may illustrate it by the course in architecture, I say we are trying to build, to live with the atmosphere and to do that in a way that is

17:54.496 --> 18:14.614
energy saving and therefore economically important and so there's usually a sort of few sentence statement of what we're trying to do and then basically I never did lecture from notes

18:15.607 --> 18:25.563
That's not to say that I wouldn't have piece of paper in front of me with perhaps eight headings that I wanted to get through in the course so that it kept me on track.

18:27.226 --> 18:42.390
I always felt that in many cases it was best to speak from the experience after you've got one's own thoughts ordered of course and not jump from topic to topic.

18:42.370 --> 18:58.193
And another thing that I did, except for one time when I was sick, I graded every one of my own papers and I never used True Force and I never used a Scantron.

18:59.375 --> 19:00.337
I would grade them all.

19:01.238 --> 19:05.965
That was the only way I felt that I could become aware of

19:06.738 --> 19:14.388
hmm, the student really obviously hasn't understood this last theme, so let's have a get-together.

19:15.029 --> 19:27.666
Or to be able to say, well, their percentage has gone down from the last test or gone up, which was very good, and communicate that to them.

19:27.686 --> 19:30.850
Give praise where it's needed and guidance where it's needed.

19:31.972 --> 19:36.458
And try to keep a rapport with the students in that manner.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.252
Normally you gave how many tests per semester?

19:41.054 --> 19:44.617
About three or four.

19:45.598 --> 19:49.662
And were there, in meteorology, are there term papers, term projects?

19:50.162 --> 19:51.363
In some there were.

19:51.523 --> 20:06.597
I found that a very rewarding way of doing things with regards to the one in regional climatology, which then later became regional and physical climatology, was to let them choose an area of the world

20:08.213 --> 20:31.999
not an area that they knew, and write about what the weather was, how we believe that that weather originates, why you get that pattern, and then the impact of the weather on the life of the people there, what clothes they wear, what houses they build, what crops they grow, what animals they have, and all that sort of thing.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.183
And the students loved that.

20:35.298 --> 20:35.979
I really did.

20:36.299 --> 20:38.843
Oh, now that causes a question to pop into my brain.

20:39.624 --> 20:51.459
Based on your experience, what would have been the most difficult regions of the country, of the world, that a student could have selected for that?

20:52.721 --> 20:58.268
Where would the weather be most difficult to predict, understand, describe?

21:00.357 --> 21:06.624
When you get right down to it, the most difficult to predict is wherever you are at that time.

21:07.865 --> 21:14.291
You could sit in the middle of the Sahara in Taman Rasset and say, it's not going to rain today, it's going to be very hot and so on.

21:15.252 --> 21:17.255
That way you would miss the extreme.

21:18.035 --> 21:28.406
You would not... Forecasting... Is it not?

21:28.426 --> 21:29.267
I would say that

21:31.154 --> 21:39.156
It comes right down to it of forecasting either isolated events such as

21:39.794 --> 21:52.129
big thunderstorms and so on, which make a large impact on the community, or organised systems like fronts and so on.

21:53.290 --> 22:06.966
We're learning, of course, during the hurricane season, any year particularly, from July to October, that it's very difficult to forecast where the hurricanes are going to go.

22:07.908 --> 22:10.512
They go where they want to go, like the old six-foot gorilla.

22:10.572 --> 22:32.447
And I'll never forget one of them, where we, at a faculty meeting, we'd sort of... All came to an agreement, which was very unusual, that this hurricane moving into the Gulf at the time, it's a name I forget, was going to curve, come up to the northwest, then north, and come in through Texas.

22:32.815 --> 22:38.541
It must have hurt us because it continued straight west and went into Mexican mountains, didn't do anything that we're supposed to do.

22:39.683 --> 22:57.422
And fronts, of course, are very confusing, as you notice what happens so often if you watch Weather Channel or hear the news, but when we've got perhaps three fronts moving in,

22:58.128 --> 23:02.673
to our region, our region being Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, and so on.

23:03.273 --> 23:14.725
You don't know which one's going to win out, because it's all energy flows, and we just don't know which one has the biggest punch that's going to make its way through.

23:15.545 --> 23:28.118
Is the Texas weather that you and I have, is it more complex than most other areas, or is it about average in its complexities of prediction?

23:30.848 --> 23:32.931
Again, I suppose it's hedging.

23:32.971 --> 23:34.593
It will depend where you are in Texas.

23:35.274 --> 23:49.434
But, you see, we do have, for instance, we can, unfortunately, just about predict with 80 or 90 percent accuracy what the summer's going to be like in 2010.

23:51.917 --> 23:56.063
Hot, humid, not enough rain.

23:56.482 --> 24:22.692
we get a good idea of what the winter is going to be we have in this whole region generally a few mini winters which might last a few days or just a couple of weeks and go and so overall one can say that this is the sort of condition we're going to get but at certain times of the year fall and the spring

24:23.127 --> 24:24.410
then it's a different game.

24:25.293 --> 24:34.236
So the complexity not only changes with your location, but the time of year, the season, really.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.141
Would Texas be

24:36.745 --> 24:39.850
different from other regions in those generalizations?

24:39.870 --> 25:01.723
No fundamentally they all have real problems that impact upon the people drastically and disastrously sometimes at certain times of the year when you just have to keep up to date with what is going on and

25:01.990 --> 25:16.504
We find that there's really nothing to beat watching a radar screen to see what's happening in order to try and get an idea of what's going to happen in the, say, the rest of the day, or the next few hours at least.

25:17.605 --> 25:24.031
All that information is available to us now on TV or on our computers.

25:25.332 --> 25:31.778
After you moved to Texas, what were the greatest surprises for you about the realities of Texas weather?

25:36.348 --> 25:49.613
Number one would have to be, although I knew of course in terms of numbers what the summers were like, that what it really interpreted as.

25:51.396 --> 25:57.968
People would say to us, well of course you've come from Africa, you've been years out there,

25:58.420 --> 25:59.504
He said, now, wait a minute.

25:59.865 --> 26:01.933
It was never like this.

26:02.796 --> 26:08.717
When I was in very hot places, such as the Nubia and the Saharan Desert and these sort of spots...

26:09.524 --> 26:31.583
We might get 120 but the humidity was 5 or 7 percent and when we had very high humidity it was usually near on the Great Lakes or by the oceans and so there was the ameliorating effect of the sea breeze and coming off a cooler water body.

26:32.153 --> 26:39.722
And so the idea of getting 100 degrees with very high humidity, no, we really hadn't experienced that.

26:41.665 --> 26:47.392
While I was getting caught out, you'd look out as we could today and say, gosh, oh, isn't it lovely?

26:47.432 --> 26:49.234
I'll go out and work in the yard for a while.

26:49.555 --> 26:51.998
Ten minutes later, I'd have to call for Joan to help me in.

26:52.679 --> 26:55.422
And it's very, very deceptive.

26:56.023 --> 26:59.427
Now, and our northers, as we Texans call them,

27:00.419 --> 27:06.906
is the rapid movement and severity of those that's kind of unusual isn't it?

27:07.326 --> 27:09.789
That is very extreme.

27:09.849 --> 27:26.967
It's because at that time of the year you're getting a big mass of air moving over a cold inland region.

27:27.419 --> 27:37.404
And so you're likely to get that only in an area with big land mass, such as North America or Asia.

27:38.467 --> 27:44.702
But you see in Asia, if you think about it, the big mountain chains run east-west.

27:45.188 --> 27:57.426
Right through the, from the Alps, right through the Caucasus, the Pamias, the Himalayas, the Chinese mountains, and they block it.

27:58.588 --> 28:04.276
Here our main mountains run north-south, and they don't do a very good blocking job.

28:04.297 --> 28:06.219
They funnel things down.

28:06.259 --> 28:11.167
And so we get very extreme conditions.

28:13.050 --> 28:14.031
Hadn't thought about that.

28:15.344 --> 28:20.690
Let's see, back to teaching.

28:22.613 --> 28:34.366
Surely there were a few times when some student came to you with some fable about his or her problem that had to have special consideration.

28:34.767 --> 28:41.655
Do you remember any of those anecdotes that you can share where a student had a sob story that they apparently had made up

28:45.922 --> 28:50.648
Perhaps the students that I had were not too original thinking on this.

28:51.169 --> 28:58.378
It was the loss of something that had been taken from their car or so on.

28:59.019 --> 29:05.127
But no original anecdotes that you might read in Reader's Digest or something.

29:06.188 --> 29:14.038
My favorite example is a boy who told me the first day of class when I told them when the tests were and that that's when they had to take them.

29:14.710 --> 29:17.814
He came up and told me how ill his grandfather was.

29:18.054 --> 29:20.878
And I said, oh, I hope it's not terminal.

29:20.918 --> 29:22.240
He said, oh, it's almost certain.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.041
And I said, oh, gee.

29:23.722 --> 29:30.451
And then he grinned and said, in fact, it's almost certain he's going to die the first day of deer season.

29:30.511 --> 29:33.395
So we both chuckled.

29:34.737 --> 29:35.117
Let's see.

29:36.759 --> 29:42.507
Any examples that you recall of student thoughtfulness for you as a faculty member?

29:42.959 --> 29:44.681
courtesy, politeness?

29:48.806 --> 29:52.090
I would have to say innumerable small occasions.

29:52.411 --> 29:56.876
I've really been impressed by the politeness of the students.

29:57.537 --> 30:03.685
I've also appreciated receiving notes from them, thanking me and

30:03.665 --> 30:25.099
even now years afterwards getting emails and saying how they're using these data and the concepts we put forward and so on and that is sort of what makes teaching well worthwhile rewarding

30:25.552 --> 30:39.342
aspects I think of two that covered the same ground basically but many years apart and I so wish that that had been repeated

30:41.701 --> 30:51.294
200 times, and that is when advising students, the undergraduate students that you follow through from freshman to senior.

30:52.696 --> 31:07.337
Twice a student, when we have talked about what they really need, have said, well I also want to take, or I want to drop this other course because I want to take this one.

31:07.891 --> 31:16.508
that won't count towards my degree, but I want to get a rounded education, and I would like to do that.

31:16.528 --> 31:19.474
And so, right away, all right, that's it, Steve?

31:19.494 --> 31:21.337
Yes, that's it.

31:23.021 --> 31:26.828
And I've always thought there was a sort of unfortunate...
