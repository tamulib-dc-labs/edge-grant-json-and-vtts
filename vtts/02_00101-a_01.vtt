WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:10.463
June 22nd, testing one, two, three.

00:11.928 --> 00:20.320
This is June 22nd, and I have the pleasure and honor 
of chatting with Gary Halter, professor of

00:11.928 --> 00:20.320
political science. Today we're going to be 
recording his memories of his student years.

00:26.950 --> 00:30.155
Later we'll do his faculty years. Gary, for 
someone who might not know you in the future as they

00:31.217 --> 00:36.805
listen to this tape or read the transcription, 
begin by describing where you grew up, where you

00:36.785 --> 00:42.297
went to high school, what your family did. 
Describe your life before coming to A&M. I was born

00:45.986 --> 00:47.209
in Amarillo. My grandparents moved out there and 
my mother's family in 1912, I think, and bought

00:51.888 --> 00:57.373
land when the XIT Ranch broke up. And we lived there 
until I was six years old, and we moved to Oklahoma

00:57.393 --> 01:05.120
City for about five years, and then eventually to 
Wichita Falls. My dad worked for General Mills,

01:05.160 --> 01:09.404
and these were jobs that he was moved to. And he was a 
flour miller for General Mills. And really from, I

01:13.247 --> 01:21.034
guess, the sixth grade on, I was around, I only went 
to the first grade in Amarillo and then we moved to

01:21.368 --> 01:23.224
Oklahoma City. Moved to Wichita Falls when I was in 
the sixth grade. I graduated from high school

01:26.363 --> 01:35.353
there and then attended Midwestern University 
for a year in Wichita Falls before coming to Texas

01:26.363 --> 01:35.353
A&M. You went to Wichita Falls High School? Yes, 
Wichita Falls Senior High. When you got out of high

01:41.761 --> 01:50.030
school, what did you think was your goal in terms of 
major and your profession later? I wanted to be a

01:50.411 --> 01:51.612
veterinarian. And you went to Midwestern and 
lived at home? Yes. And I worked for a veterinarian

01:58.248 --> 01:59.630
there. How did you come to A&M? How did you know 
about it? What led you to consider coming here? I

02:05.919 --> 02:08.363
was the only vet school in Texas and still is. And I 
did get a scholarship from Rotary Club in Wichita

02:08.744 --> 02:18.158
Falls, which really made it, I guess, possible for 
me to come to A&M. And how much was the scholarship?

02:20.482 --> 02:21.563
It was about $500. Tuition was $50 a semester and 
then I had a job and work. I didn't have a lot of money

02:27.752 --> 02:31.396
but I wasn't hard up either. Books were, you know, 
nothing like that. You got here in the fall of what?

02:36.103 --> 02:40.228
Fall of, I guess it would have been 1960. Had you 
visited before you came down to enroll? No. You had

02:44.459 --> 02:46.141
never been to College Station before. How did you 
get here that first time? I came with a friend who

02:47.744 --> 02:52.691
had been here the year before, who came his 
freshman year. Well, it would have been both

02:53.773 --> 02:57.699
freshman years and rode down with him. What did you 
bring? Oh, that they had sent us, the material and

02:59.682 --> 03:14.186
stuff that we had to have, the uniform, the number, 
you know, sort of a list of things that you're

02:59.682 --> 03:14.186
expected to have with you when you arrive to 
survive in the Corps, I guess. Also, it was in a big

03:14.226 --> 03:16.289
trunk.

03:19.895 --> 03:22.259
Was it one of the official footlockers? Yeah, 
everybody had to have it. Where did you get that

03:23.621 --> 03:24.863
footlocker? I don't remember. I bought it 
somewhere. You bought it. And

03:28.484 --> 03:36.696
describe arriving and getting out and finding 
your dorm and that sort of thing. Well, I still

03:37.337 --> 03:46.371
remember the first time you turned the corner 
there at Texas Avenue, Highway 6, and what's now

03:37.337 --> 03:46.371
University Drive. I'm not sure what it was then. 
You looked over and saw Texas A&M. You had this

03:50.098 --> 03:52.581
water tower and smokestack. I thought it was a 
state prison at first. It really was a

03:55.085 --> 03:58.570
bleak-looking place. I think somewhat 
disappointing. I think it was something like,

04:00.873 --> 04:07.843
that's it, type deal. Now the friend you rode with, 
was he a sophomore? Yeah. He had been here the

04:13.096 --> 04:14.299
previous year. Yes, right. Had he attempted to 
acquaint you with A&M? To some degree, yeah. I

04:20.254 --> 04:24.685
think you kind of knew something about what to 
expect, you know. Did you have any difficulty in

04:26.808 --> 04:34.519
the paperwork of transferring hours and getting 
admitted and all that? No, that was, I don't think

04:34.880 --> 04:39.226
it's near as complicated as it is today. Okay, now 
describe moving into the dorm and getting into an

04:40.768 --> 04:50.082
outfit as a sophomore. Well, I came here expecting 
to be a freshman, and then I went over to the

04:50.062 --> 05:01.038
military science departments. I'd already been 
in a year of ROTC at Midwestern, because they also

05:01.058 --> 05:10.411
required all, just like A&M did at that time, 
compulsory two-year ROTC program. And they did it

05:10.852 --> 05:13.335
at Midwestern because they got paid. So all the 
guys got to do that. And they also got down on PE. I

05:16.924 --> 05:18.749
think they had to do so. And I went over to them and 
they said, well, you've already had the first two

05:19.711 --> 05:24.063
years. You can't be a freshman in the Corps. You're 
going to be a sophomore in the Corps. And so they

05:27.524 --> 05:33.272
send you back and say, go tell your company 
commander who goes into orbit when he hears this.

05:33.372 --> 05:34.894
God damn, this can't happen. You can't be a damn 
sophomore. Anyway, it was a big confrontation, I

05:36.316 --> 05:44.448
presume, between he and the military people, 
because he came back and said, well, damn it, I

05:36.316 --> 05:44.448
don't like it. Anyway, I think had I known, I 
probably would have said, that's okay, I'll stay a

05:49.816 --> 05:51.838
freshman. I don't know what the military people 
would have said, but it was kind of a case of you

05:52.179 --> 06:02.331
weren't accepted by sophomores because you 
hadn't been through the trial by fire and the

05:52.179 --> 06:02.331
freshmen resented it. But I wasn't smart enough to 
realize that that was gonna be a problem. Were you

06:07.358 --> 06:08.359
called a frog? Yeah, oh yeah. Describe your room 
and your roommate and that sort of thing. Well,

06:17.288 --> 06:21.273
everything was steel or concrete, I think, in the 
dorms at that time. You had steel bunk beds and

06:21.313 --> 06:24.456
steel desks. They did have these big old wooden 
chairs. I know Paul Van Riper bought a bunch of

06:26.979 --> 06:28.982
them. He still has them out on his porch in his house 
in Bryan. And steel chest of drawers, concrete

06:32.886 --> 06:41.997
floor, no curtains, I guess, anything like that. 
They were pretty bleak. And how was your roommate

06:44.322 --> 06:48.311
assigned? They just said, this is your roommate. A 
guy by the name of,

06:52.179 --> 07:00.036
his nickname was Cocky Anderton. He was from Bel 
Air in Houston. Anderton? Yeah, Anderton. And

07:05.449 --> 07:07.573
this was by sheer accident? Yeah. You didn't know 
each other? No, no. All right, now I know about Fish

07:10.179 --> 07:12.724
Old Lady nickname. Was there a nickname for a 
sophomore roommate? No. Well, I didn't have one,

07:16.993 --> 07:20.320
but anyway. And what outfit? Company G3. What was 
the nickname? I don't know that it had one. Which

07:28.171 --> 07:28.732
dorm? 16, I believe it was. In the, quote, new dorm 
area, new core area. It was a Northgate dorm area.

07:34.781 --> 07:35.342
Oh, Northgate. Oh. Northgate dorms. It's sort of 
obscured now because they built those

07:38.025 --> 07:42.612
dormitories with the open-air balconies on them. 
It's sort of behind that. It was the furthest

07:46.677 --> 07:49.322
dormitory to University Drive. Does it have a name 
now? I'm sure it does, and I have even seen it, but I

07:51.246 --> 07:55.314
don't recall what it is. No elevator, you know. We 
were on the fourth floor, as I remember. And the

08:00.766 --> 08:10.664
first floor was occupied by company E2, which had 
the dog, the sacred pooch, Reveille, you know. And

08:11.386 --> 08:21.604
there was all of these seniors in the E2 would stand 
at the bottom of the stairs and every time he would

08:11.386 --> 08:21.604
leave for, you know, breakfast, lunch, or dinner 
and harass you about something. There was one guy

08:21.624 --> 08:23.027
that He was Hispanic, and his name was Rodriguez. 
And he expected us to roll the R when we said

08:26.534 --> 08:32.947
Rodriguez. And we would say, hello, Mr. 
Rodriguez, and stuff like that. And of course, he

08:37.456 --> 08:39.480
would just go into orbit. There wasn't much you 
could do though. You could act embarrassed and

08:42.002 --> 08:45.907
stuff like that. And he would threaten me what he 
was going to do. Anyway, and it was really, I'm

08:47.870 --> 08:53.517
trying to think of the guy's name, another guy that 
did it a lot.

08:56.521 --> 09:06.413
He and some of his friends later owned, in the sense 
they had a loan on what's now Central Park and

08:56.521 --> 09:06.413
College Station. And when I was mayor, you know, 
they called and they wanted to talk about whether

09:06.393 --> 09:12.126
the city would be interested in buying this land. 
And they had a note with the Arnold family, and it

09:12.186 --> 09:19.062
was about interest and loan payment at the end. 
They'd only been paying interest. They used it as a

09:20.826 --> 09:22.930
party place on weekends. They could play football 
games and raise hell. And so anyway, these guys

09:25.917 --> 09:28.681
called one to meet with me about it. I thought the 
name sounded familiar, but of course I didn't

09:28.801 --> 09:36.113
until I arrived at my office at City Hall. I hear the 
guy used to harass me at the front of the stairs.

09:41.060 --> 09:44.746
Anyway, despite that, the city still bought the 
land from us. But it turned out, I think, to be a good

09:45.227 --> 09:51.216
deal for everybody, for the Arnolds and the city 
and everything. How did you, as a transfer, become

09:51.196 --> 09:59.728
oriented to all kinds of Aggie traditions and so 
forth? Well, very quickly I think was part of it,

09:59.748 --> 10:04.755
but not quick enough according to some. Were you 
given a guidebook or anything printed? Well, you

10:09.000 --> 10:16.731
had a campusology book, and I think you had to buy 
those at Lupo's or something. And you had to be able

10:16.711 --> 10:27.178
to answer all of these questions, you know, like 
where are the pennies in the sidewalk and what's on

10:16.711 --> 10:27.178
the back of Lawrence Sullivan Ross' statue and, 
you know. All right. Did a sophomore get quizzed by

10:28.741 --> 10:31.328
juniors? Well, I did because, you know, I was kind 
of harassed as a freshman even though the, you

10:31.747 --> 10:40.537
know, once again it was the ROTC people that said 
this guy's a sophomore. It wasn't the Corps that

10:40.557 --> 10:43.100
was doing it. And I was sort of surprised that the 
current Corps commander that says I'm an advisor

10:43.260 --> 10:49.087
to the Corps and I can't really interfere. I can 
suggest things. This is the Marine General. I

10:52.631 --> 10:55.395
can't suggest, I don't like to suggest things. It 
certainly wasn't that way when I was there.

10:59.810 --> 11:06.358
Colonel Joe Davis, I think he was the commandant, 
lived where Vice President Malin Southern lives

10:59.810 --> 11:06.358
today in that house. And, you know, they did a lot 
of, including surprise inspections in dorms and

11:06.438 --> 11:14.687
looking for booze. And, you know, they even knew 
where we hid most of it. You take the medicine

11:17.771 --> 11:22.476
cabinet out and hang it on a string behind the wall. 
Were

11:22.456 --> 11:31.491
you identified in anything on your uniform as a 
transfer student? Was there any? Well, you know,

11:32.373 --> 11:35.318
you have different belt buckles that you wear. A 
transfer had a different belt buckle? Right, you

11:37.441 --> 11:41.047
had to wear a freshman belt buckle, not a sophomore 
belt buckle. It's a smaller Army issue. Well, all

11:42.991 --> 11:46.236
the other brass is the same. The battalion shields 
and the cross rifles and the AMC brass, I think, was

11:46.216 --> 11:56.674
on the collar. I think I still have that somewhere. 
Were there any, were you assigned some clean up

11:58.315 --> 12:04.264
duties and all that other stuff? I don't think any 
more than anybody else. I mean your Saturdays were

12:07.690 --> 12:19.007
taken up with drill and other, most Saturdays 
were, or you know, court reps to football games or

12:07.690 --> 12:19.007
something. All right, academically, how did you 
get your fall courses? Did you register after you

12:23.533 --> 12:25.115
got here? Yes. Describe registration. Well, I 
think it was in Sabisa Dining Hall. And you walked

12:30.782 --> 12:36.108
around and picked up slips of paper. I mean, this is 
pre-computer card days, I think. And if there was a

12:39.452 --> 12:47.442
card available in the class at the time, you got the 
class. Yeah, I don't remember the exact problem,

12:47.422 --> 12:55.655
but then you went through a number of stages of 
harassment and you finally got out of the place

12:47.422 --> 12:55.655
with a schedule. That first semester as you went to 
class, describe, make any comparison you can

12:56.997 --> 13:08.755
think of between the class routines here and what 
you had known at Midwestern. Well, you know, just

13:09.528 --> 13:15.082
going to class could be an experience, an 
harassment of various and sundry sorts. You know,

13:15.884 --> 13:18.691
and you had compulsory friendliness. You had to 
say howdy to everybody. And if you knew somebody,

13:20.415 --> 13:26.490
you had to say howdy, whatever their name was, you 
know. And if you forgot, then you were in trouble,

13:26.470 --> 13:29.235
you know. And anyway, it was, you know, it really 
wasn't a very pleasant experience. You had to whip

13:35.004 --> 13:39.171
out and introduce yourself to everybody. And I 
guess they've stopped all that, I think. I

13:42.456 --> 13:49.508
remember when I came back as a faculty member, I 
still had freshmen come in and say, howdy, Mr.

13:42.456 --> 13:49.508
Holmes, my name is Ray So-and-so, you know. I 
always wanted to do the Lloyd Taylor routine. I

13:52.593 --> 13:55.437
heard that he would say, my name's Shit. I don't 
know whether that's really

13:56.038 --> 14:01.866
true or not. In class, though, from the faculty's 
point of view, was there any difference between

14:02.447 --> 14:15.146
A&M classes and Midwestern classes in the way the 
faculty dealt with the students? No, I don't think

14:15.246 --> 14:16.187
so. They were, you know, they were small classes, 
just like they were at Midwestern, maybe 20, 25

14:16.167 --> 14:25.399
people at the most, you know. And what did you get? 
Except for chemistry. Chem 101 was still the way it

14:27.902 --> 14:30.125
is. Who taught that? I don't remember the guy's 
name. I know for one, I think the second chemistry

14:34.691 --> 14:43.543
course I had was Rakoff, who was still around as a 
faculty member when I came back as a faculty

14:34.691 --> 14:43.543
member. Did he have a nickname? If he did, I don't 
remember. I don't remember. Did you have any

14:51.235 --> 14:54.720
impressive faculty that first year? Some people 
that you still remember, plus or minus? Well, I

15:00.389 --> 15:02.112
don't recall exactly who I had. Years kind of, 
because I was only here two years and they kind of

15:02.172 --> 15:05.597
ran together. There was a guy over in sociology 
that I know you knew, Harold Brown. I guess I had

15:10.634 --> 15:34.386
never thought about some of the things that he, and 
he made light of a lot of activity on the Corps,

15:10.634 --> 15:34.386
trying to get them to think about, in some cases, 
the exact stuff that the Bonfire Commission found

15:10.634 --> 15:34.386
of tunnel vision and my optic thinking and things 
of that type. I don't know. I was really, I guess I

15:34.987 --> 15:39.936
just never encountered that before. See, he lived 
across the street from us. Yes. And he'd gone to, in

15:43.583 --> 15:54.703
Kentucky, oh, boy, the four-year, the small 
liberal arts college for poor kids. Oh, Berea,

15:54.802 --> 15:56.804
Berea? Berea, Berea College, yes, he and his wife 
both. And the last I knew, he was at the University

16:00.187 --> 16:03.471
of Delaware. Yeah. Was there for many years. I had a 
friend in graduate school at the University of

16:06.754 --> 16:22.150
Maryland who had gone to Delaware, you know, and we 
started talking about faculty members and

16:06.754 --> 16:22.150
somehow we both had this guy. He had one place to 
meet another. Yeah, I think he was. Of course, you

16:26.497 --> 16:32.730
had a great deal of influence on me, but that was my 
second year, which would be my junior year in

16:26.497 --> 16:32.730
college. Right. That first year, describe your 
day's routine on a class day. What time did you get

16:38.342 --> 16:40.426
up, what did you do, when, and so forth. Take 
through the whole day. Well, some guy blew a

16:42.170 --> 16:46.616
whistle out in the hall, you know, some freshman 
that was resigned. By what time? About 6.30, I

16:49.079 --> 16:50.881
think it was. And he would say, you know, Company 
G-3, fall out for chow in 30 minutes, or whatever it

16:51.001 --> 16:56.168
was, you know. And he would recite the menu. The 
menu is, you know, whatever it was for breakfast.

17:03.517 --> 17:07.741
You had to get up and get dressed, and there was 
never any time in the morning to shower. That was

17:07.761 --> 17:10.044
something you had to do the night before. You could 
have gotten yourself up earlier, but I don't think

17:10.705 --> 17:15.009
anybody ever did that at that age. This was back 
when sleep was no longer punishment. So you'd get

17:21.396 --> 17:25.020
up and dress in whatever uniform it was. If it was 
raining, you'd have your Class C uniform on. Class

17:30.145 --> 17:32.969
A was formal dress, I guess, as I remember. You put 
all that stuff on and go fall out. And maybe the rain

17:36.053 --> 17:42.982
with a poncho on and a helmet and stand out in the 
rain until everybody got assembled. And they

17:43.042 --> 17:45.325
checked to make sure everybody was there. I don't 
know what they would have done if you weren't

17:45.345 --> 17:46.927
there. But anyway, they would do that. And then 
you'd march over to Sabisa. dining hall and go in

17:51.914 --> 17:58.282
and you set, you know, sort of assigned tables. And 
generally there was a senior at the table and maybe

17:59.144 --> 18:07.575
some sophomores and freshmen. And the freshmen, 
of course, were there to do everything but cut up

18:07.615 --> 18:16.827
the seniors' meat, so to speak, in the sense of make 
sure that everything that he wanted. They

18:16.907 --> 18:19.170
literally didn't do that, but you know what I mean. 
That's what it struck me as. And, you know, you went

18:21.293 --> 18:29.766
through that and then you would leave and you 
didn't march back to the dorms, you went back to the

18:21.293 --> 18:29.766
dorms with your classes. And you had to come back at 
noon, you know, and make formation again at noon

18:30.167 --> 18:40.303
and march over to Savisa and have lunch. And then, 
you know, once you got through, you left. went to

18:44.125 --> 18:50.232
afternoon classes, and then you might have some 
free time in the afternoon to do things. Of course,

18:50.272 --> 18:51.634
there wasn't much to do. What about intramurals? 
Well, there was that, intramural sports in the

18:54.618 --> 19:02.026
afternoon, or go to the library and try to hide. 
There was an old building called Bagley Hall. And

19:07.632 --> 19:11.423
it was about where the Biological Science 
Building East is now. And there were places in

19:12.385 --> 19:16.316
there where you could go and study and nobody would 
bother you. So we used to sneak over to Bagley Hall

19:16.858 --> 19:21.631
and hide among the plants. There was one room where 
and all these plants in there. Nobody seemed to

19:24.096 --> 19:25.777
mind you being in there. They had lights on when 
they were growing these plants. You'd go in there

19:28.661 --> 19:30.282
and study. If you went back to your dorm room, you'd 
get a rest. You didn't want to do that.

19:39.473 --> 19:45.539
You had to keep your uniform on all day long and 
change different uniforms depending on what it

19:39.473 --> 19:45.539
was. There was also, of course, several days a week 
we had to do Yale practice. because it was really

19:51.136 --> 19:57.079
hard to learn complicated yells like farmer's 
fight. Farmers, farmers, you're all right. You

20:00.838 --> 20:02.019
know, I mean, it was terrible. It took me years to 
learn.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.407
Anyway, so we went. There were two or three nights a 
week you'd go to y'all practice. Occasionally

20:10.732 --> 20:15.138
you'd have silver taps, you know, which everybody 
came to, I think. Describe your impression of your

20:15.559 --> 20:18.303
first silver taps. Well, it's pretty awesome, you 
know, for a young guy, you know. I mean, there'd be

20:23.210 --> 20:26.695
like maybe four buglers up in the, on the second or 
third floor, I don't know, I never was in there, but

20:27.316 --> 20:49.530
up in the dome of the academic building and they 
would, the doors in the base are opened and they

20:27.316 --> 20:49.530
would play taps and it kind of resonated out of the, 
out of the dorm, the dome of the, thing and

20:27.316 --> 20:49.530
everything of course is, is there no lights, pitch 
dark, you know, and it's, it's, you know, and

20:27.316 --> 20:49.530
everybody's quiet. It's pretty solemn. Did, did 
you all take it seriously? Oh, yeah. No pranks or

20:54.535 --> 20:57.319
jokes? No, not at that, or hazing or anything. You 
just quietly walked over and stood around the

21:00.684 --> 21:10.838
quadrangle in front of the academic nagel in 
Bolton Hall, and nobody said anything. I think

21:10.958 --> 21:15.184
there was, after taps or before, there were rifle 
shots. The Ross Volunteers in front of Sully would

21:15.224 --> 21:23.175
stand there and fire, I guess, a 21-gun salute, and 
then everybody went back to the dorms. All right,

21:23.999 --> 21:32.848
normally on a non-Silver Taps evening, you fell 
out for chow at what time? It was early, miners'

21:33.989 --> 21:39.175
hours, like 5.30 or so, you know, and maybe 6. And 
then, you know, some evenings, too, there were

21:40.076 --> 21:52.048
drills, not like, not as condescending as they did 
every Thursday night, you know, but there would be

21:40.076 --> 21:52.048
evening drills sometimes. practicing marching 
around Kyle Field, another complicated

21:52.636 --> 22:03.486
procedure that, anyway, you'd do those kinds of 
things, and the band would play, and then he might

21:52.636 --> 22:03.486
have you all practice. And then there was always 
what we called a quarters, of course, for freshmen

22:03.586 --> 22:08.830
and sophomores. You had to be in your dorm room, at 
your desk, both feet on the floor, you know, et

22:08.850 --> 22:21.782
cetera, and studying from a certain time to a 
certain time.

22:23.011 --> 22:29.263
During that first semester, did you get the 
impression that this was a serious place about

22:23.011 --> 22:29.263
academics? No. It wasn't? No. In terms of rigor, 
compare here with what you had experienced at

22:32.088 --> 22:37.138
Midwestern. I don't know that it was any more 
difficult, to tell you the truth. I don't recall

22:41.740 --> 22:43.422
that it was. Did they give you all that old lecture 
about early on, look to your left, look to your

22:44.683 --> 22:53.592
right, because only one of you is going to be here to 
graduate, that sort of thing? I'm sure they did.

22:55.614 --> 23:01.741
But I remember very early on, this was, I think, 
when I was still a freshman, which lasted about a

22:55.614 --> 23:01.741
week. The guy says, why did you come to A&M? And I 
said, well, I came to get an education. And he

23:07.561 --> 23:11.734
screamed, he said, that's not the reason you came 
to A&M. Why did you come to A&M? I'm sorry, I thought

23:14.227 --> 23:16.150
I came here to get an education. You came here to be a 
fightin' Texas Aggie. And they would go through

23:19.795 --> 23:21.278
all that routine. And I think that was part of the 
problem I had, you see, is that I never quite

23:21.298 --> 23:29.950
accepted that the reason I was here was to become a 
fightin' Texas Aggie. I thought I came here to get

23:30.331 --> 23:31.733
an education.

23:34.317 --> 23:39.745
But there were great opportunities for not study, 
one thing the Corps provided you with. come up with

23:39.725 --> 23:47.614
excuses to polish brass and shine shoes and look a 
lot sharper than everybody else. Your first

23:50.117 --> 23:53.561
football games, what was your impression there? 
Oh, that's very exciting. The whole drama, of

23:57.786 --> 24:04.534
course, you've got the home game, you're going to 
have midnight yell practice beforehand. I came to

24:04.514 --> 24:12.296
call them later the Nuremberg rallies, the 
torchlight parades to Kyle Field and all of that.

24:12.376 --> 24:15.064
And then of course the marching in around the track 
at football games. Of course, Kyle Field was a

24:17.544 --> 24:21.110
fraction of what it is now. It had that one little 
upper deck where the press box was. In fact, that

24:26.039 --> 24:29.885
thing is still there under the existing thing. Now 
you and your buddies all went to the games. Oh,

24:32.370 --> 24:32.911
yeah, yeah. There wasn't a question of it. Did you 
have any football dates in the fall, that first

24:35.916 --> 24:39.803
fall? Not here at A&M. I think when we went to TWU or 
went to, I guess, what game must have been? The

24:47.374 --> 24:48.316
court trip? Court trip to Dallas or something. We 
had the date with some, you know, the arranged

24:51.761 --> 24:58.873
dates with women at TWU that was still kind of 
lingering. How were those arranged? Well you just

25:01.012 --> 25:10.801
had a mixer thing, you know, and if you found 
someone you wanted to ask to go to the game with you,

25:01.012 --> 25:10.801
you'd ask them. Now I've heard stories about moose 
pots, beast buckets, a pot, everybody puts some

25:12.283 --> 25:22.332
money in and the guy that gets stuck with the 
dullest date gets the money. Did you ever hear any

25:22.813 --> 25:24.475
of that? No, we didn't do that. I can see that that 
would even still be done today probably. Do you

25:29.159 --> 25:32.204
remember the first year, was it Fort Worth or 
Dallas? No, I don't. I think that it was Fort Worth.

25:36.410 --> 25:41.518
And how were Aggies treated by the local people on a 
court trip? Oh, they were treated very well. Do you

25:44.543 --> 25:45.784
remember how you got up there? Well, in somebody's 
car. Well, I didn't have a car my first year, so I

25:49.410 --> 25:53.316
don't know who that was. Did you ever do any Aggie 
hitchhiking? No, I didn't. Because I think that

25:58.730 --> 26:02.574
was pretty well gone by the 60s. I once, in fact we 
became pretty good friends, and I'm trying to

26:02.594 --> 26:15.448
remember his name, but I was leaving to go to 
Houston because I had met this girl that was going

26:02.594 --> 26:15.448
to the University of St. Thomas. And I think they 
came up for the Newman Club, which is the Catholic

26:16.470 --> 26:23.938
student organization over at St. Mary's Church. 
And I went down to go out with her in Houston. And I

26:28.584 --> 26:30.126
was going out. There was an Aggie out on the road 
hitchhiking. And I picked him up and took him down

26:32.829 --> 26:35.973
to Houston. And he said, well, you know, for giving 
me a ride, he said, why don't I take you to lunch? And

26:42.902 --> 26:43.563
I said, yeah, great. So we go to the Houston Country 
Club. Now, this guy is a relative.

26:52.319 --> 27:02.775
He was the Mr. Houston for years, the guy that was in 
the

26:52.319 --> 27:02.775
Roosevelt administration. Jesse Jones? Yeah, 
Jesse L. Jones was related to Jesse L. Jones. At

27:08.062 --> 27:09.224
least he claimed he was. I'm trying to remember his 
name and I can't. We also, I think, went to Austin

27:13.615 --> 27:20.086
with us one time later on to a game and all. And he was 
sort of a secretive guy in some respects, but had

27:20.106 --> 27:27.017
some interesting tales of Texas. While we're on 
football, the court trip your freshman year, was

27:29.381 --> 27:36.653
it to Houston or Austin? Do you remember? Yeah, no, 
I don't. When you went to Texas games, did those

27:42.255 --> 27:46.881
turn out to be special either year?

27:49.644 --> 27:53.328
No, we just got whipped, as we usually did, yeah. I 
had a friend from high school, Travis Reagan, who

27:53.348 --> 27:58.113
was a football player at A&M. At that point, one of 
our stars, I think, and I think it was It was my

28:05.219 --> 28:11.568
junior year that we almost beat them in the Texas 
game. It was here at Kyle Field, I do remember that.

28:14.672 --> 28:30.112
And Travis caught a pass and came down in the back of 
the end zone and of course the referees ruled him

28:14.672 --> 28:30.112
out of bounds because Texas was number one in the 
nation and there wasn't any way that A&M was going

28:14.672 --> 28:30.112
to win that game. That's what everybody 
concluded. And there were films that showed she

28:32.776 --> 28:38.727
was clearly in bounds and that Texas should have 
lost the game. But I'm convinced it was just a

28:38.787 --> 28:43.376
foregone conclusion. And I think Texas came over 
here kind of unprepared. A group of people that had

28:45.981 --> 28:49.508
done almost nothing all year long. We had a coach 
that used to punt on third down. I forget what that

28:52.313 --> 28:56.100
guy's name was, but I always found that. an odd sort 
of strategy that if you screwed it up you'd have

28:57.447 --> 29:02.238
another chance. No you wouldn't. You'd just be 
screwed up. Anyway. What did you and your buddies

29:07.910 --> 29:15.507
do those years on Saturday night after a football 
game, a home football game? There wasn't much to

29:18.153 --> 29:20.159
do, you know. Come back to the dorm room, maybe try 
to find some beer somewhere, get an upperclassman

29:20.700 --> 29:28.020
to buy some stuff for you. Where did Aggies drink 
beer then? Well, not in the dorms. That was a real

29:34.654 --> 29:36.196
no-no back then. And, of course, drinking age was 
21, as it is now. And, you know, sometimes you'd

29:40.682 --> 29:44.366
drive out on the university farms. In fact, out in 
this area where we're sitting, we'd come out here

29:44.487 --> 29:49.693
and drink beer. There used to be a The place south of 
here, the Brazos Bowman had an archery range, and

29:55.058 --> 30:04.640
the gate was not very secure, so you could go in 
there and go back in the woods. They had kind of an

30:04.661 --> 30:10.173
area there with a covered thing, and it was for bow 
hunters. And that was another place you could go

30:10.955 --> 30:13.000
to. As far as you know, when beer was consumed by 
those students, perhaps below the age of 21, did a

30:12.980 --> 30:26.360
lot of people get drunk? Oh, I don't think we ever 
had enough to really get drunk. I mean, it might be

30:32.108 --> 30:37.256
you had maybe two beers for each person about the 
extent of it. Was it always pretty well all male? Oh

30:41.043 --> 30:43.572
yeah, yeah. Well there, you know, there weren't 
any women around here except maybe a few in Bryan

30:43.592 --> 30:52.161
and Colley Station and their parents probably 
didn't let them date Aggies. Did you ever go to the

30:52.582 --> 30:54.107
Claypits? I don't know. I guess not. I don't know 
where that is. Clay pits were down the Welborn Road

30:57.966 --> 31:02.032
and then down in somebody's pasture. And it had 
been an old digging. Oh, quarry. Yeah. And it was

31:06.819 --> 31:08.922
just that stagnant water. You'd go out there and 
drink, and they'd skinny dip, apparently. And I

31:12.286 --> 31:13.488
think that was earlier. Or at Whiskey Bridge. Did 
anybody you know ever go to Whiskey Bridge? Oh,

31:19.076 --> 31:19.576
yeah. In fact, when you turn 21. You went out there 
on your birthday, and Alma would give you your

31:22.100 --> 31:29.752
choice of, I don't think anything in the house, but 
you got a choice of something. Now you say who did?

31:31.495 --> 31:31.835
Alma. E-L? No, A-L-M-A, Alma. Oh, a female. The 
woman that ran Whiskey Bridge. Oh.
