00:01.837 --> 00:15.998
We need to

00:01.837 --> 00:15.998
stop trying to pay people to do nothing, which is 
what we're doing, pay people to do nothing. And we

00:16.779 --> 00:19.443
sometimes can't get enough people to work.

00:23.589 --> 00:28.857
And I think we've got to release a...

00:32.414 --> 00:46.736
some sort of mentality developed that the 
government's supposed to take care of everybody

00:32.414 --> 00:46.736
that doesn't want to work.

00:46.876 --> 00:58.153
And I don't say that there aren't some people that 
need it, and there are, but I think we've gone

00:46.876 --> 00:58.153
overboard the other way.

00:58.173 --> 01:00.497
I was at a meeting yesterday where we were 
discussing CETA. They poured money down a rat

01:01.220 --> 01:02.882
hole. And very little good has come out of

01:04.545 --> 01:09.451
it. They tried to take all these things that they 
targeted groups and put them all in one act.

01:15.299 --> 01:21.067
Comprehensive Education Training

01:15.299 --> 01:21.067
Act. It's a disaster.

01:25.813 --> 01:30.720
They put people in training and pay them more while 
they're in training than they can make after they

01:25.813 --> 01:30.720
get through training. You think they want to work 
then?

01:37.453 --> 01:40.997
We pay them with no withholding, no income tax. Pay 
their transportation, pay their child care, and

01:42.679 --> 01:47.405
all that. Then they go to work at a job with minimum 
wage. And they already get minimum wage, plus a tax

01:50.488 --> 01:55.193
credit. So we've got a lot of strange values.

02:00.721 --> 02:20.362
I think

02:00.721 --> 02:20.362
the

02:00.721 --> 02:20.362
role of the woman in our society has changed 
completely, and for the good. And when we were even

02:21.143 --> 02:28.591
thinking at the end of World War II, how would we 
ever get the manpower to fight Russia? The only way

02:29.512 --> 02:30.593
we would get it The only other source we had was 
women. That's the only other source.

02:39.824 --> 02:43.269
So I think they're going to be important in many, 
many ways. If they only replace men in civilian

02:45.593 --> 02:54.587
jobs so that men can go fight what they have to 
fight. I hope we don't. I think we ought to be

02:57.331 --> 02:59.955
prepared to do that. this universal military 
training would give us a backlog

03:00.138 --> 03:25.255
of reservoir to draw from in case we needed it, with 
some training.

03:25.275 --> 03:27.158
And I certainly hope we don't have to fight a war. 
Thanks a lot

03:28.285 --> 03:37.519
for the interview.
