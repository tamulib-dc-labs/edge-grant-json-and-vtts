00:04.334 --> 00:13.124
The following is an interview by Laney Holder of 
Miss Irene Taylor, her great-great-aunt, a

00:04.334 --> 00:13.124
resident of Park Plaza Nursing Home in Mark, 
Texas. Miss Taylor is 84 and a retired

00:13.605 --> 00:16.568
schoolteacher. The date is February 15, 1975.

00:28.262 --> 00:28.683
OK. In the year of 1864, the Great Civil War Why and 
what was it all about? It concerned the freedom of

00:40.445 --> 00:45.673
the Negro slaves. Our grandparents, the 
McCullochs, are you getting it all right? The

00:52.022 --> 01:02.758
McCullochs and the Caldwells had never owned a 
slave, but they became involved. by letting the

01:03.380 --> 01:11.948
good Presbyterian preacher tell them they should 
vote to free the slaves. He only won. I got to say

01:13.850 --> 01:18.414
this. Our grandparents, McCullochson, had never 
a slave, but they became involved by letting the

01:18.514 --> 01:32.728
good Presbyterian preacher tell them they 
should. He owned one nigger slave. How did he come

01:38.607 --> 01:40.569
by that nigger slave? Well, I don't know. That we 
don't know. He only had one slave? He only had one

01:45.654 --> 01:50.899
slave, but he told all this congregation how to 
vote. He had a slave, but he wanted them to not vote?

01:53.902 --> 01:55.543
That's right. And so they did what he told them. Of 
course, he told them, I guess he got it from the

01:58.907 --> 02:02.310
religious points you knew that it wasn't right to 
keep a person in slavery. I've never heard all of

02:08.800 --> 02:15.248
them, but they voted as he suggested. And that 
caused them to lose their homes on the good farm

02:15.889 --> 02:27.644
lands of mid-Tennessee. They were living among 
people who had voted to hold the Negro in slavery,

02:30.893 --> 02:42.707
and in so many words, they became outcasts in their 
own land. They became outcasts because they voted

02:42.727 --> 02:49.035
against... Because they voted for... To free 
them? To free the Negro. The neighbors ran them

02:51.217 --> 02:53.119
out? What is it? Did their neighbors run them out? 
Yes, their neighbors all voted to hold them

02:57.570 --> 03:02.158
because they had slaves, you see. But these people 
of ours had no slaves. They were just letting folks

03:06.025 --> 03:12.697
that had their slaves tell them what to do. They 
didn't have them, they didn't know what to do. had

03:19.477 --> 03:33.132
voted for the Negro slavery war, they became 
outcasts in their land.

03:33.793 --> 03:49.230
They lingered about

03:33.793 --> 03:49.230
trying

03:33.793 --> 03:49.230
to make They lingered about for two years trying to 
start over and thinking maybe things would

03:49.514 --> 03:58.567
improve on them. Did they stay there? Yeah, they 
stayed around there two years and they were scared

04:00.750 --> 04:05.957
to death. They wouldn't have stopped at anything.

04:12.211 --> 04:21.041
committed murder or anything else, those 
neighbors were, that were mad at them for voting to

04:12.211 --> 04:21.041
get free their neighbors. Well, were the 
neighbors freed then? Well, they had not known.

04:26.408 --> 04:29.391
They were still as slaves. They were not freed 
until later.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.075
In other words, they were people without a life. So 
they

04:47.497 --> 05:05.152
decided to leave and go in search of a new home in the 
wilds of the west of Texas.

05:05.172 --> 05:12.559
With the first buds of spring, they loaded the 
wagons, six or eight wagons in all. I don't know

05:17.148 --> 05:21.533
just how many, but several wagons. They were the 
McCullochs and the Caldwells. They were the kin

05:25.097 --> 05:28.961
people, and then there were some others that went, 
too. And of course, our grandparents had three

05:28.981 --> 05:37.631
children. Four. They had four, really. Three 
girls and a boy. Mama was the youngest of the girls.

05:48.479 --> 05:52.322
And this boy was a little older than she was. And he 
was the one. Well, I'll go on. Just kind of stay with

05:55.585 --> 05:58.608
Mama. And so they decided to leave.

06:09.317 --> 06:10.018
Because... towards the wilds of Texas. They were 
headed for the wilds of Texas, the first buds of

06:14.241 --> 06:17.507
spring. I read that one. And look, they loaded the 
wagons, six or eight in number, and for safety's

06:19.451 --> 06:31.955
sake, pledged to start cooking. You want to wait a 
few minutes?

06:38.028 --> 06:56.267
I don't know who went beside their relatives, but 
there was a group that went, I'm sure, because

06:38.028 --> 06:56.267
there wasn't such a big family of the McCullers or 
such a big family of the Caldwells. They were

06:56.287 --> 06:57.568
relatives? Yes. Our grandmother McCulloch had 
been a Caldwell, and these others were her

06:58.929 --> 07:07.478
relatives. And so they went on and started banning 
the stream and it took them until, and of course the

07:08.065 --> 07:26.349
roads were about over. But they got to, well I don't 
know exactly what month, but it was sometime in the

07:26.369 --> 07:31.836
summer. How in the world did they decide to come to 
West Texas, of all places? places to come clear to

07:37.006 --> 07:40.050
Texas, and where they came to. They came to, well, 
at that time, you see, there was no towns in Texas.

07:46.719 --> 07:50.684
The nearest one to Texas was Jefferson, Texas. 
There's a Jefferson there now. But that wasn't the

07:54.008 --> 07:57.212
town they came to, I suppose. The little place 
where they came to, that's where Papa and Mama were

07:57.232 --> 08:02.319
married. I didn't think I'd ask this question. And 
all of Starksville. And I don't know where this

08:11.209 --> 08:13.032
here is. Starksville? Starksville. Not 
Clarksville, but Starksville. And I don't know

08:17.659 --> 08:21.063
whether there's a settlement there now or not. I 
don't think there is. But now that's where they

08:23.607 --> 08:25.590
settled. And when they went to town to buy 
groceries, they had to go to Jefferson, which was a

08:25.610 --> 08:33.781
long trip away from where I was. St. Louis, Texas? 
Jefferson is in deep East Texas now. Now, there's

08:38.908 --> 08:41.753
still a Jefferson there. There's a town there. 
Someday maybe you can go to Jefferson. And they

08:46.299 --> 09:00.440
would have to go by wagon, of course, and then lay in 
their supplies with, you know, for several months

08:46.299 --> 09:00.440
at a time. Should buy flour by the barrel, sugar. I 
wonder what the prices were like then. I don't

09:06.406 --> 09:07.348
know. I don't know about that. Claire might know. 
I'll ask him. There's a man in there with him, but I

09:12.035 --> 09:13.858
don't know. Some history or something you might be 
able to find out. The prices? The price of the flour

09:20.588 --> 09:22.251
and the sugar. I was just wondering if you might... 
And the bacon. Now they got bacon, I'm sure,

09:26.170 --> 09:29.375
somewhere. Of course they raided as soon as they 
could. I don't guess they took any cows with them.

09:36.885 --> 09:44.917
And somebody mentioned they took the cows to make 
them some milk for women and children. But there

09:44.937 --> 09:47.861
were very few children in that group. My mommy was 
the youngest, and I think she was 12 or 14 years old.

09:53.693 --> 09:57.177
And there just weren't many children in that group 
at all. And so, but anyway, I understand that they

09:57.757 --> 10:05.065
took the cows and cows. And I don't guess they tried 
to take a pill with that on the mansion. They did.

10:09.770 --> 10:12.673
Well, did they homestead the land or buy it or what? 
Well, now I don't know. I'll ask Claire.

10:22.465 --> 10:28.974
They bought that man, and he knows who he bought it 
from. He bought the man, the son of the man they

10:29.014 --> 10:38.027
bought it from, lived in Rosebeck, and there's 
still some people there by that name now. Hayes.

10:39.108 --> 10:43.034
H-A-Y-S-E,

10:39.108 --> 10:43.034
I guess. Well, and that's who they bought it from. 
He said that they bought it, and I don't know the

10:46.578 --> 10:50.123
price now. I just don't know. I can go back and ask 
him if he knows anything about the price. I don't

10:57.729 --> 11:01.553
imagine he does. And they couldn't have had much 
money to bring with them because they didn't get

11:01.573 --> 11:11.425
anything for what they

11:01.573 --> 11:11.425
were buying. And way later on, there was a man that 
said she was going to stay. She went home, went

11:22.422 --> 11:28.407
home, and she stayed alone. That's where they 
were. And they couldn't bring her out. Don't know

11:35.213 --> 11:39.637
whether she died there or what became of her. Mama 
called her Aunt Jane.

11:44.101 --> 11:46.403
I had nothing. But anyway, she left behind some. 
They're all good. Of course, it wasn't much, but it

11:53.810 --> 11:56.795
was a whole lot. Some money later on was called for 
the mountain land. That's where she had lived. And

12:03.384 --> 12:13.920
they, a whole, and I remember when my mom or I, I 
guess I remember, I've heard it talked about

12:03.384 --> 12:13.920
though. Many of them, they got some money. And it 
was put in that little farm at Thornton, it's

12:16.785 --> 12:20.931
called. Well,

12:21.991 --> 12:30.961
how did they get from West Texas to here? Why did 
they come here? Why did they finally leave? Oh,

12:34.544 --> 12:37.568
well, you see, it's a long story about where they 
lived. They lived, I don't know how long they

12:37.648 --> 12:39.389
lived. And then they moved from Starksville to 
what was called Lamar County. They moved from

12:46.177 --> 12:51.222
there and not so far from the Blossom. Now there's a 
town in Blossom Hill. That's where a lot of- Is that

12:54.289 --> 12:59.375
in South Texas? No, it's in North Texas. North 
Central Texas. And that's where they went when

13:05.503 --> 13:12.352
they left that little place on the border where 
they stopped. And they came there and that's where

13:13.233 --> 13:17.378
they You know, they had their land there, and they 
had a good farm and made such a terrible, sad

13:18.151 --> 13:29.402
mistake when they left their farm in Lamar County 
and went west. Why didn't they make just more

13:29.422 --> 13:31.124
opportunity? That's what they thought. They were 
looking for opportunity, I suppose. And still

13:38.431 --> 13:46.099
these band of relatives that came were all still 
together.

13:48.425 --> 13:58.016
And this, and you see, Clem and I are the only ones 
that are left. And our mother's left. How many

14:03.222 --> 14:05.905
children were in your family? In this valley, Mama 
had three sisters. That's right, she had had three

14:10.970 --> 14:15.435
sisters. And she only had two sisters, because one 
had died back in, the oldest child was a girl, and it

14:18.395 --> 14:29.991
had died back in Tennessee with whooping cough. 
Somebody told them if they would, she was about 12

14:30.712 --> 14:45.411
years old, if they would rub her chest with the 
preparation of tallow and something else, and the

14:30.712 --> 14:45.411
first turpentine of what, she would never cough. 
And they did. And whatever it was. And she didn't

14:51.867 --> 14:52.768
come. But at the end of the time, instead of getting 
rid of her, six weeks getting rid of her and go off

14:53.669 --> 15:03.644
like an ordinary child, she died. Because that 
stoppage of that flea in her throat caused her...

15:03.664 --> 15:11.616
That turpentine and talon? Talon and turpentine, 
I think. I know it was talon. That he's rubbing on?

15:16.584 --> 15:18.827
They rubbed it on her chest, made a mixture of it. 
and rubbed it on her chest. And that band was not in

15:21.980 --> 15:26.006
there anymore. I had two sisters, and she, that was 
three, and the brother was just older than my mom.

15:32.656 --> 15:34.679
My mom was the youngest of the mom. Esther, 
E-S-T-H-E-R.

15:35.900 --> 15:47.397
And the way she, her, our father had come from 
Tennessee, two but not the same place in

15:47.950 --> 15:55.161
Tennessee. And he had a relative named Taylor, her 
only relative that we know of, Taylor, who was

15:55.321 --> 16:06.838
Porter McCullough. And our daddy, and maybe I 
guess our uncle Sam, that's the one that your

16:07.559 --> 16:17.113
granddad Taylor was named for, had made And I don't 
know what year they married, and I would have to

16:18.072 --> 16:28.122
look that up. It's in the Bible, they told me. But we 
haven't got that here, but you have everything.

16:33.748 --> 16:35.890
How long do you have to work on this? Oh, a long time. 
I'll be back down here. And we have the... Yes, we

16:46.017 --> 16:47.560
have the Bible. And we also have the Lamb. The first 
in the Bible. The Bible is there too. It was on the

16:54.451 --> 16:55.854
table. Your parents' Bible? Yes. And

16:58.919 --> 17:05.370
the table and the Lamb. We do not have the chariot. 
Now we have a handmade chair, but I don't think it's

17:08.275 --> 17:21.029
the chair that went with the table. But we

17:22.471 --> 17:31.501
use it all the time anyway, because it's oak. And 
then they were married. At that time they had a home

17:33.263 --> 17:37.287
of their own. They would all go together. And 
there's one thing about it that I never heard.

17:47.109 --> 17:54.859
There was never a death on the way, which was 
unusual for that day and time. None of them died on

17:54.879 --> 17:57.783
the way here? No. Let me interrupt you just a 
second. That was unusual for back... How long did

18:02.008 --> 18:05.673
it take them? Well, it just says... They got here in 
the summer. They left in early spring. Several

18:12.969 --> 18:14.291
months, you know. Well, this is kind of 
backtracking, but didn't they all originally

18:15.333 --> 18:19.919
come from Scotland? Yes, yes, they did, of course. 
Now, they had the ancestors had come from

18:23.184 --> 18:28.351
Scotland. But that's, now I don't know much about 
that. Don't you have the money box that Don't you

18:35.114 --> 18:37.557
have the money box that they... Yes, we have the box 
that... Now that man that...

18:37.577 --> 18:46.666
Well, that money... He was a... This couple were 
rather old, but they had a son. And they were frail.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.138
They were very frail. But he wanted to come to the 
United States to live. He felt like there was more

19:01.642 --> 19:15.259
future in the United States for him than there was 
back in that part of Scotland, I don't know. So

19:15.279 --> 19:30.298
they sold everything they had and put it in gold in 
that money box.

19:31.156 --> 19:57.180
boarded ship and started to of course it was a 
sailboat and both both parents died on the way they

19:31.156 --> 19:57.180
can recall something a mouth disease i suppose it 
was called black tongue and they both died and were

19:31.156 --> 19:57.180
buried soon they bring their children with them 
Well, no, they didn't have any. This son was the

20:00.111 --> 20:04.797
only thing, and he had never been married. Just 
they and their son, parents, McCulloch, and their

20:04.858 --> 20:14.191
son were the ones that came. And so they all came, 
but he came on. And he landed in America in about

20:26.236 --> 20:31.863
1720.

20:34.786 --> 20:47.581
And he invested that money, all he had in the world, 
and it turned out to be worthless stock.

20:49.943 --> 20:51.465
He lost everything? He lost everything. I said, 
now, what his name was, I don't know. It may be in

20:57.165 --> 20:59.168
some of the books at home. I don't know what his name 
was. But he went on and raised a family from then on

21:01.933 --> 21:05.659
out. That's what they're all. And then they 
drifted. He drifted directly on down to where Mama

21:11.108 --> 21:19.581
and them were living in Tennessee. Our 
grandfather was named Porter. Our grandfather is

21:22.906 --> 21:26.890
not the man that lost the gold. I know that. And our 
cousin, this Rufus Taylor, the only Taylor

21:30.154 --> 21:43.751
relative Mama ever saw, went back to Tennessee. 
The father's sister? Well, no. He was our father's

21:46.955 --> 21:49.117
first cousin. First cousin. And he went back to 
Tennessee. And he wasn't, to say, involved in

21:54.870 --> 21:58.015
this. He was in a different part. He was not 
involved in the Civil War. Well, did any of your

22:02.721 --> 22:05.465
family serve in the Civil War? Do you know? Did 
which? Any of your family serve in the Civil War?

22:10.492 --> 22:11.113
Yes. Yes, they did. But now I don't know. 
Grandfather had a brother killed in the Civil War.

22:21.931 --> 22:24.775
He was either killed or died. I don't know just how 
many. I'll ask Clem. He might remember.

22:34.287 --> 22:39.313
He was trying to get some horses out somewhere, and 
he was drowned. It was during the Civil War, all

22:39.994 --> 22:42.578
right. He was a soldier, but he was drowned, Clem 
says. Instead of murdered, he was drowned. Okay.

22:50.708 --> 22:54.392
Going back to when the family was in Blossom, where 
did they move after that? Where did they leave?

22:55.974 --> 22:58.477
Where did they go to when they left Blossom? Well, 
now that's where they went to West Texas. And that

23:04.904 --> 23:10.170
was, they went to Merkle. It's near Abilene, isn't 
it? It's near Abilene. That's where they went from

23:14.635 --> 23:17.379
there. And Clem was Now, Clem was born at Blossom. 
Where was Anpot born? Well, I guess he was born

23:26.790 --> 23:29.693
there, too. They were there a number of years. Were 
they farming or ranching? No, they were farming.

23:38.863 --> 23:40.385
As dry as it is? Well, it wasn't as dry at Blossom as 
it was. Now, they got into the drought when they got

23:44.509 --> 23:48.874
west, you know, when they went west. They had 
plenty of rain at Blossom. It was plenty of rain.

24:01.356 --> 24:05.740
And they were, I guess, clean. And then you see 
there was Dorothy. She was born. She's the oldest.

24:11.165 --> 24:12.827
She's the oldest. And the next is Bill's daddy, 
our... That was Belle. And then there was a boy.

24:24.141 --> 24:28.105
There was a boy named Porter that died. He was next 
to Belle, I think. And then next was your

24:31.169 --> 24:32.770
granddaddy. And then there was Albert, the one 
that lived in Dallas. And then last of all was

24:36.955 --> 24:40.078
Claire. And they were all born in Lamar County. Are 
you the youngest? I'm the last. And Uncle Roy was

24:47.478 --> 24:49.841
next to you? Yeah, he was just over there. And we 
were born in West Texas. We were born near Abilene

24:56.188 --> 25:01.434
in Morocco. And of these Carl Wells, I can go back to 
them because they were the near relatives. Now,

25:09.503 --> 25:17.232
they had a daughter, Carl Wells did, and she 
married a man named Hudson. And she was just mama's

25:20.088 --> 25:21.910
age. And she married this man named Hudson. They 
were living in, or still living in Lamar County

25:27.716 --> 25:32.621
when they married. And they had one child, a girl. 
And that girl, that made her just about Clem's age,

25:36.945 --> 25:41.990
87. And she lived until Christmas. She was about 87 
and she lived in Fort Worth. We heard from her as

25:50.159 --> 25:54.145
long as she was able to write. And she died just 
before Christmas. We heard from her, but we don't

25:59.333 --> 26:07.545
know the day she was buried and all, but we know. Now 
that was the only one of the Carwell. There was a

26:09.307 --> 26:13.273
bigger group in Mama's family than there was in in 
the Colorado. Your mother was McCulloch?

26:17.866 --> 26:27.686
McCulloch, M-C-C-O-W-L-O-C-H.

26:17.866 --> 26:27.686
Why did they leave Merkle? Why did they leave 
Merkle? Well, it was dry and somebody told them

26:32.491 --> 26:43.128
Miss Clem said that Mama and Papa always depended 
on this Uncle Sam that your daddy was named for. He

26:43.429 --> 26:50.761
was a mighty fine man, but he wasn't any better 
manager than the rest of them. But Papa always

26:50.781 --> 26:52.804
depended on him a lot. So they listened to what he 
said? Yeah, they listened to what he said. And he

26:56.811 --> 26:58.954
said they ought to go to South Texas. That's when 
they went to South Texas. And so a little town is

27:03.186 --> 27:07.713
there now. See, we didn't leave there. We didn't 
leave South Texas until after the 1900 storm.

27:16.006 --> 27:17.568
That's the Galveston storm? Not Galveston. Big 
storm in the 1900s.
