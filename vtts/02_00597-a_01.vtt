WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:09.530
I had it from February 28th of 61, the day the 
decision came down, until May Day of 61. And

00:09.691 --> 00:28.317
the moment that the court decision came down, Carl 
Braden and I, a companion case from Louisville,

00:09.691 --> 00:28.317
Kentucky, went from ordinary citizens to become 
national

00:09.691 --> 00:28.317
figures.

00:32.802 --> 00:42.852
The New York Times, for example, the day after this 
came down, ran three full pages on the majority and

00:32.802 --> 00:42.852
minority opinions. I got back to L.A. and was 
invited to speak at Berkeley. I get up there,

00:48.818 --> 00:52.862
there's 5,000 people, 5,000 in New York. 
Princeton's Wig Clio, the Northwestern

00:54.203 --> 01:02.151
University Journalism Department, the

01:05.742 --> 01:12.772
Yale University made Carl May the guest of honor at 
the law school, and the moot court arguments on our

01:05.742 --> 01:12.772
case. That happened. And as these things 
happened, these press releases were funneled

01:14.535 --> 01:18.620
back to Hoover. We now have the record from the 
agents of the field to Hoover. Wilkinson spoke in

01:24.569 --> 01:28.034
Colorado Springs yesterday. There were 2,000 
people. That And Hoover writes across the bottom,

01:32.675 --> 01:36.620
when is this going to end? And somebody writes, 
contacts him and says, they have another appeal.

01:44.589 --> 01:49.675
Hoover writes, see blank in the Supreme Court and 
ask when this is over. When will they be jailed? And

01:56.343 --> 02:00.808
we don't know who blank was in the Supreme Court. 
and the report came back, the ACID was followed,

02:02.324 --> 02:20.080
filed one more appeal, they'll have at least until 
May 1st,

02:02.324 --> 02:20.080
and Hoover writes, expedite this in every way you 
can.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.422
Now that is the atmosphere in which we went to jail. 
Exactly. And you have a Jack Kennedy who was

02:23.483 --> 02:30.829
gutless and feared, feared Hoover, who was the 
most, what's the word, profligate,

02:31.602 --> 02:41.774
sex active president we've ever had. All this was 
being taped by Hoover just as much as he was taping

02:43.396 --> 02:50.084
Martin King's sex. And these things were all 
there. And then you gotta go back to the principles

02:55.890 --> 02:58.714
of the Kennedys. Bobby Kennedy was on the 
McClellan Committee. Yeah. And did, violated all

03:02.608 --> 03:12.639
lawyer-client privileges between Jimmy Hoffa 
and his lawyers. They have a bad record. Yeah, I

03:14.682 --> 03:15.403
know. And yet, the image of this young, youthful, 
bright, what's the, what's the Shakespearean

03:15.983 --> 03:25.434
word? Vigor. The, you know, the Shakespearean 
Camelot atmosphere, that's a lot of bunk. At any

03:36.259 --> 03:58.427
rate,

03:36.259 --> 03:58.427
to wind up this point, the Citizens Committee to 
Preserve American Freedoms lasted from 1952

03:36.259 --> 03:58.427
until it was dissolved in 1960, and dissolved in 
1960 because the ideas we'd proved at the local

03:36.259 --> 03:58.427
level

04:01.377 --> 04:15.859
were to go national, and four very prominent 
national leaders decided to form a new committee

04:01.377 --> 04:15.859
and hire me as director and put an umbrella over me. 
One was Alexander Micklejohn, the former

04:16.741 --> 04:28.819
president of Brown and Wisconsin and foremost 
constitutional philosopher of this century. and

04:30.385 --> 04:36.512
who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
by the way, from Kennedy in 64. No, 62. 62.

04:41.779 --> 04:43.681
And he died in 63. No, he died after he was 63, 
because he awarded it. He died when Lyndon Johnson

04:50.829 --> 04:54.213
actually gave him the medal. That was the time when 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom meant

04:54.354 --> 04:59.700
something, before they started giving it to him. 
Frank Sinatra for Whitaker Chambers. Yeah, I

05:03.406 --> 05:05.389
know. Amazing. Mikkel John was the philosophical 
giant. He is the one that reached my conscience

05:10.574 --> 05:17.902
from probably 1952 to 1955 or 1956. I had no sharp 
First Amendment

05:19.844 --> 05:28.173
basis for my ethics. If the Un-American 
Activities Committee had gone after maybe

05:30.308 --> 05:35.153
somebody on the far right. I might not have fought 
as hard. In 1955, Michael John testified before

05:40.078 --> 05:49.727
the Hennings Committee of the United States 
Senate, in which he spelled out the limits of free

05:40.078 --> 05:49.727
speech. It's a wonderful testimony, a very brief 
essay, and I read it. And we invited him to one of our

05:57.038 --> 06:02.484
meetings where we were defending the foreign 
born, some religious leaders in LA. And I heard

06:02.885 --> 06:03.506
him. He was then 85 when I first met him. And he 
completely turned my life around. In fact, I said

06:09.713 --> 06:22.348
when I met him, if I ever get a subpoena from UAC 
myself, I'll go to jail on the First Amendment if

06:09.713 --> 06:22.348
necessary. And that was literally said by me in 56.

06:28.898 --> 06:30.820
The other person was Aubrey Williams. Aubrey 
Williams was the director of the National Youth

06:32.182 --> 06:35.725
Administration.

06:38.048 --> 06:42.733
He was the head of the WPA under Harry Hopkins. He 
and Harry Hopkins and A. Philip Randolph, through

06:43.914 --> 06:56.728
Eleanor Roosevelt, were able to get a wartime FEBC 
ordinance through, through Roosevelt.

06:59.307 --> 07:12.122
Aubrey was a social worker from Montgomery, 
Alabama, educated at the University of Wisconsin

06:59.307 --> 07:12.122
at Madison. He was an extreme bread baiter. He was 
caught up in the Cold War as much as anybody I've

07:16.868 --> 07:19.891
ever known. Very significant. Because toward the 
end of his life, he himself was called before the

07:28.079 --> 07:43.658
Eastland Committee at the time that Eastland was 
trying to put the red label on Aubrey's next-door

07:28.079 --> 07:43.658
neighbor, Virginia Dewar, who in turn was the 
sister-in-law of Hugo Black.

07:43.678 --> 07:55.572
Aubrey began learning in the early 50s, and when he 
got out of the WPA and Roosevelt put him in to be head

07:43.678 --> 07:55.572
of rural electrification, he could not get 
confirmed because of the red-braiding

07:56.986 --> 08:01.692
atmosphere in the country.

08:05.597 --> 08:12.505
Aubrey, while he was head of the WPA, would fire 
somebody on the rumor that they were communists.

08:14.788 --> 08:20.155
By 1960, he hired me, at a time when I would not 
answer the question anymore. And I remember so

08:22.298 --> 08:26.503
well, we're starting this thing out, He said, I 
want to get some prominent politicians. I don't

08:32.072 --> 08:33.534
trust Jimmy Roosevelt. He's no good. I'd already 
had bad experience with Jimmy. So he said, I think

08:36.018 --> 08:42.567
Chet Holifield would be a good person to be one of 
the co-chairs of this committee with me. So he went

08:43.869 --> 08:55.225
to see Chet Holifield, who was the congressperson 
from Montebello, California, later to become the

08:43.869 --> 08:55.225
head of the Atomic Energy subcommittees in the 
House. And apparently, John Olivefield, who I had

08:57.078 --> 09:09.810
known very well in the housing days, in fact, he 
came to me and I hired his daughter to get her a job

08:57.078 --> 09:09.810
when she was a student. But by 1960, Olivefield

09:09.830 --> 09:23.904
said that he would do it, but only if I would say I 
wasn't a communist.

09:23.924 --> 09:26.967
In other words, he was giving me the true loyalty 
oath. Aubrey wrote me that I got Chet today. He's

09:30.538 --> 09:31.019
willing. All I need from you is a brief statement 
saying you're not a communist. He sent it to me in

09:37.869 --> 09:46.221
L.A. And I figured this is more of the same stuff I'd 
seen from 48 forward. And I wrote back to Aubrey a

09:47.103 --> 09:54.253
two-page letter saying, Aubrey, you know, I've 
I'm not going to answer this question to Chet or

09:54.807 --> 09:57.870
anyone else. I've been through too much. I'm going 
to jail on this issue probably within another

10:00.473 --> 10:05.238
year. I'm not going to start answering it away from 
the committee for the convenience of a politician

10:05.959 --> 10:13.126
like Chet Holifield. Aubrey writes back my 
special delivery, and we used to use that kind of

10:13.146 --> 10:23.717
mail, saying, Frank, I see, I know your 
principles, I know you won't answer. but I see in

10:24.187 --> 10:32.157
the second paragraph on the second page that you 
really are telling me you're not a communist." And

10:32.177 --> 10:43.251
I sit down, I write a special delivery back to 
Aubrey saying, there's nothing in the second page

10:32.177 --> 10:43.251
in the second paragraph that tells you any more 
than Chet, the answer to that question. So Aubrey

10:44.573 --> 10:48.698
sends a telegram back, to hell with Chet, let's go. 
And from then on, we never had the loyalty test

10:54.173 --> 11:07.488
within the Committee to Abolish UAC, and we had 
hundreds of supporters, and people from people

10:54.173 --> 11:07.488
who were very radical and probably were communist 
to people who were anti-communist. We just

11:07.508 --> 11:12.653
refused to have a political litmus test in our own 
program to get rid of UAC. Sure. That's what ACNU

11:13.234 --> 11:16.738
was doing, it's what ADA was doing, it's what The 
NAACP were doing the all, you signed up at ACNU at

11:17.410 --> 11:21.594
that time. Yeah. You had this where you're not a 
member of a communist, totalitarian, what about

11:22.275 --> 11:28.601
the organization. The third person in this group, 
these names are important, to each play a function

11:28.621 --> 11:34.567
on our success. Mikkel John is the moral leader. 
He's the philosopher. He is the purist and the

11:41.574 --> 11:44.317
absolutist on the First Amendment. He's the one 
who taught me absolutism on the first. Aubrey is

11:48.494 --> 11:55.845
the practical wheeler-dealer, Harry Hopkins, 
who knows how to get things done in Washington. He

11:57.588 --> 12:00.452
often told me he only made one mistake in his life. 
He said, that's when I hired, I was looking for an

12:01.894 --> 12:05.279
N.Y.A. director in Texas. I heard about this 
fellow, a teacher out at San Marcos School, and I

12:07.502 --> 12:14.593
hired him. And then he went on to be president, and 
I'm sorry ever since. He told me that just before he

12:18.329 --> 12:22.473
died in the midst of the Vietnam War. Third person

12:23.975 --> 12:36.508
was Clarence Pickett of the Quakers, the American 
Friends Service Committee, who was the

12:23.975 --> 12:36.508
nonviolent, pacifist, loving type. So our 
campaigns were never, there was no rhetoric, no

12:36.568 --> 12:43.035
nailing-to-the-wall rhetoric in our campaign. 
It was all solid, principled, First Amendment,

12:43.055 --> 12:47.560
constitutional arguments. No mean stuff. No mean 
stuff, no anger in our movement. The fourth guy is

12:53.953 --> 12:56.317
an unbelievable character. They're all dead. 
He's a retired Wall Street banker from

12:59.041 --> 13:04.249
Wandsville, New Jersey. His wife's

13:05.451 --> 13:13.885
father, uncle, brother are all state Supreme 
Court judges. But in 1948, this guy left Wall

13:14.675 --> 13:32.398
Street, had a good sum of money, retired next to the 
Lawrenceville School there outside of

13:14.675 --> 13:32.398
Princeton, and got involved with Henry Wallace, 
and ran for U.S. Senator from New Jersey on the

13:32.438 --> 13:43.112
Progressive Ticket, and that nailed him to the 
ground. From then on, he was worse than the

13:43.531 --> 13:46.294
ordinary garden bride. He was a Henry Wallace 
communist. These four men hired me. And that's

13:53.581 --> 13:55.203
where the campaign started. It took us 15 years, 
from 1960 to 1975, before we finally abolished the

13:57.045 --> 14:03.031
committee. We now know, from the FBI record, in our 
damage section of our lawsuit, although we're not

14:13.703 --> 14:40.639
any longer seeking substantive damages, but we 
would be able to prove, I think, that we could have

14:13.703 --> 14:40.639
abolished UAC in five years if the Un-American 
Activities Committee had left us alone, if the,

14:13.703 --> 14:40.639
not only Un-American, if the FBI had left us alone 
and let us go into the marketplace and just settle

14:13.703 --> 14:40.639
our arguments without having the FBI coming in to 
disrupt and poison the atmosphere around us. How

14:48.743 --> 14:51.668
did the FBI work on poisoning the atmosphere? Did 
they send in agents who would get agitators to go to

14:51.748 --> 15:08.314
your meetings and whip up the crowd, or did they 
hand out leaflets, or did they make charges

14:51.748 --> 15:08.314
against you that appeared in the press 
mysteriously, or what were the tactics that they

14:51.748 --> 15:08.314
used? you know enough about the record to have 
listed the four major categories. The FBI

15:18.349 --> 15:26.778
concentrated, you know, you have to realize that 
our file is as tall as a seven story building. And

15:28.740 --> 15:37.930
they,

15:28.740 --> 15:37.930
I've got my first 4,500 pages, a little pile in that 
picture there. In that pile alone, The FBI reports

15:40.930 --> 15:52.907
their success in getting 46 of my meetings 
canceled by going ahead of me to a community to try

15:40.930 --> 15:52.907
to get people who invited me to withdraw and 
cancel. They had me banned in Wisconsin, in

15:53.949 --> 16:10.853
Minnesota, in Ohio State, at the University of 
North Carolina,

15:53.949 --> 16:10.853
in Michigan State.

16:13.972 --> 16:18.178
All of these things, I never, never dreamed it was 
the FBI. I said over and over again, we're living in

16:19.180 --> 16:24.208
a McCarthy atmosphere. You have to understand 
that people are frightened and fearful. And

16:29.175 --> 16:31.399
that's what happens. And every time they did ban 
me, we just turned it around to our advantage. And

16:36.326 --> 16:42.696
they banned me at the University of North Carolina

16:36.326 --> 16:42.696
at Chapel Hill.

16:46.675 --> 16:52.243
I was speaking the night before in Manhattan, 
Connecticut, a little town in Connecticut, at a

16:46.675 --> 16:52.243
house meeting. In the middle of my meeting, there 
were twelve people in the living room. There was a

16:56.670 --> 17:12.233
phone call that came through person-to-person 
collect for me from Durham, from students in Duke

16:56.670 --> 17:12.233
Law School, wanting to know if I'd be willing to 
speak at Duke Law School tomorrow. I said, no, I'd

17:12.253 --> 17:15.298
love to, but I'm speaking at Chapel Hill. you know, 
20 miles down the road. And they said, oh, no,

17:18.382 --> 17:19.563
you're not. You've just been banned. Governor Dan 
Moore has banned you. I said, well, I don't know

17:24.649 --> 17:26.171
anything about this. They said, well, you better 
take our word for it. We want to make you the guest of

17:28.894 --> 17:36.302
honor at Duke Law School tomorrow at the time 
you're supposed to speak at Chapel Hill and are

17:28.894 --> 17:36.302
banned. I said, well, if this is the situation, 
talk to, and I named a law professor that I knew at

17:38.124 --> 17:44.391
Duke. And when I get down there, when I arrive, 
we'll talk about it. When I got there, I had been

17:49.422 --> 17:53.547
banned, so I went to Duke. They had a packed 
auditorium in the Duke Law School. Twenty-five

17:57.533 --> 17:59.515
television stations covered it. Then we went in a 
caravan up to Chapel Hill, and the students at

18:00.317 --> 18:14.496
Chapel Hill had put a long streamer along a little 
two-foot-high wall on the sidewalk in the main

18:00.317 --> 18:14.496
town, calling it Governor Dan Moore's Wall. And 
they arranged for me to stand on the sidewalk and

18:15.674 --> 18:21.966
speak over the top of the sidewalk to 2,000 
students. And then from there to the Wesley

18:23.048 --> 18:32.707
Foundation and the Hillel Foundation and to the 
Newman Club, I spoke to thousands and thousands of

18:23.048 --> 18:32.707
people. If I'd gone down there alone, I probably 
would have hit 35 students. So you could turn, in

18:39.350 --> 18:57.369
other words, you know that the FBI got a hold of the 
governor and put the pressure on him, and so he put

18:39.350 --> 18:57.369
pressure on UNC, the president at UNC, and so the 
president at UNC banned it, and what that did is you

18:39.350 --> 18:57.369
worked it to your advantage. Well, but not because 
I knew about the FBI. Right. I turned McCarthyism,

19:03.154 --> 19:07.259
as I understood it, to my advantage. Fight back. 
Now, I mentioned 5,000 students turning out at my

19:09.573 --> 19:20.663
first meeting when the decision came down in 1961 
at Berkeley. What really happened at Berkeley, I

19:21.904 --> 19:28.791
learned two

19:21.904 --> 19:28.791
years ago. The FBI was responsible for that mass 
meeting. I was home in Los Angeles. I got a call from

19:39.644 --> 19:45.711
a couple of students saying there was an 
organization called COPE, or something like

19:39.644 --> 19:45.711
that. I guess that's the word. SCOPE, or the 
acronym for some student organization in

19:49.496 --> 19:53.160
Berkeley. When I come up and speak, there's 35 
people in their group, I said, I'd love to come up

19:53.621 --> 20:00.529
and speak. I thought that was really neat. First 
time I'd been invited to speak, I'd never spoken on

20:01.971 --> 20:05.014
this subject. Here I am, on my way to jail, I get in 
touch with Mikkel John, who lives in Berkeley, and

20:08.298 --> 20:11.944
we go together. We walk through Sathergate, and 
there are thousands of people. I'm still looking

20:20.418 --> 20:25.246
for a room number where 35 students are going to 
hear me. A television camera is put in my face and

20:26.908 --> 20:35.402
asks what I have to say, and I find out that the 
meeting had been moved to Wheeler Auditorium, and

20:36.479 --> 20:47.489
then they piped it into two more auditoriums, and 
then everything from Wheeler down to Sathergate,

20:36.479 --> 20:47.489
with loudspeakers, there was 5,000 people out 
there to hear me. Humor about this. With Mikkel

20:48.930 --> 21:01.001
John with me, he's then 89,

20:48.930 --> 21:01.001
he weighed about 89 pounds, and I don't have any 
notes, or know nothing. I hear him speak before

21:01.261 --> 21:03.283
5,000 people. So I turned to him, I said, Alec, I'll 
introduce you, and you tell them about your

21:06.213 --> 21:12.100
Hennings essay. That's what sent me to jail. He 
said, oh no, Frank, this is your day, or something

21:16.226 --> 21:21.492
like that. I wanted like a hole in the head. So we're 
going, walking up to this huge crowd of people,

21:24.076 --> 21:29.903
everybody's staring at us, to Wheeler 
Auditorium. We're going backstage, and Mikkel

21:31.625 --> 21:35.410
John was trying to tell me what to say. And you've 
got a picture of him. He's just a tiny little

21:39.207 --> 21:41.529
diminutive man. He said, Frank, tell him about 
Thoreau and Emerson. Well,

21:48.156 --> 21:55.644
I'd never read Thoreau and Emerson. He didn't know 
it until that moment. So he proceeds to tell me the

21:58.127 --> 22:06.696
anecdote about Thoreau being in jail, and Emerson 
coming to visit him, saying, what are you doing in

21:58.127 --> 22:06.696
there? Henry, and Thoreau says, what are you doing 
out there, Ralph? You know the story? Crazy. And I

22:14.019 --> 22:15.641
said, oh, Alec. And he said, you didn't know that I 
said, no, I, sorry, Alec. He said, well, you get up

22:22.491 --> 22:25.355
there and make the best speech you can. And once 
you're in prison, I'll send you the books so you

22:26.457 --> 22:32.045
know why you're in there. The moment I hit Atlanta, 
he started me out on Plato He gave me a reading

22:37.355 --> 22:42.660
regimen, and it was so exhausting that I thought 
I'd never finish it. I was still in Milton,

22:43.361 --> 22:48.787
Paradise Lost, and Areopagitica after three 
months struggling. And I kept saying, when do we

22:49.648 --> 22:51.710
get the Constitution? He said, never mind, it'll 
come. Anyway, I learned why I was in prison by

22:55.594 --> 23:01.860
reading while I was in prison on Micklejohn's 
thing. But better get back to the FBI. And did you

23:04.428 --> 23:07.191
learn why the crowd was that large at Berkeley? 
That is only what I've just learned two years ago.

23:10.776 --> 23:12.778
We now have the FBI documents. This is the moment 
that the people from SCOPE, or whatever it was, had

23:13.699 --> 23:19.486
called me. The FBI went to Clark Kerr, the 
president. Was this about 1960? One. Yeah, okay, I

23:26.875 --> 23:30.379
know that group that you're talking about. 
Michael Tiger was one of them. He's a lawyer in

23:34.414 --> 23:36.137
Washington now. He clerked for William O. 
Douglas. Bright kids. Anyway, we now have the

23:41.605 --> 23:53.304
documents where the FBI, under Hoover's orders, 
when he hears I'm picking up there, goes to Clark

23:41.605 --> 23:53.304
Kerr to get me cancelled. Tells him to cancel the 
meeting. And Clark Kerr hands it over to a deputy

23:59.620 --> 24:02.183
administrator and deputy president of the 
university. And the president writes back to

24:03.805 --> 24:09.892
Hoover saying, we cannot cancel this. It's a 
legitimate student organization. And Hoover

24:13.235 --> 24:15.258
insists that they do. And Clark Kerr tells, tell 
Hoover that we'll pay his way here to speak and

24:16.539 --> 24:29.053
debate Wilkinson or come before or afterwards to 
speak on behalf of the FBI. and it comes back, and

24:30.282 --> 24:35.570
Hoover sees that memorandum of Clark Kerr and 
writes across the face of it. Absolutely not. I

24:38.655 --> 24:48.330
never trusted that Clark Kerr, that, what do you 
call him, those liberals, those poly-liberals,

24:38.655 --> 24:48.330
or some word. It's in the handwriting. I never 
trusted Clark Kerr and those others, and his

24:50.172 --> 24:56.442
deputy is another one. So when they couldn't do 
that to them, then they went to a fundamentalist

24:58.582 --> 25:11.682
group called the Baptist Fundamentalists in the 
Bay Area, connected with the 20th Century

24:58.582 --> 25:11.682
Reformation Hour. And they come to the university 
to get me canceled. And Clark Kerr turns them down.

25:20.235 --> 25:23.239
Then they get a caravan of 125 cars. And they leave 
the Berkeley campus with signs plastered all over

25:24.265 --> 25:30.774
the cars, Stop Communist Convict Wilkinson from 
speaking. And they go 125 miles to Sacramento and

25:31.474 --> 25:43.090
go around the state capitol and go in to see 
Governor Brown Sr. And Governor Brown upholds my

25:31.474 --> 25:43.090
right to speak. No one told me anything about this 
until I arrived with Mikkel John and finally there

25:43.590 --> 25:48.717
was a crowd. So then they come back and they go round 
and round and round the campus. And by the time I

25:52.442 --> 25:53.884
arrived, The FBI, through this fundamentalist 
right group, had attracted so much attention that

25:54.725 --> 26:08.998
5,000 people turned out to see my horns.

26:18.788 --> 26:24.613
One would think that with all the money and men of 
the FBI They could be more efficient.

26:29.843 --> 26:34.569
Well, you know, I've spoken... As a free society, 
though, and you just... I spoke at this wonderful

26:35.330 --> 26:43.541
conference on the right of dissent at Harvard Law 
School last Saturday. And my topic was the

26:44.602 --> 26:50.510
statutory basis of repression. In preparing for 
that, I went back through this whole life of mine

26:56.521 --> 26:57.903
You know, I'm a case. It's Wilkinson versus U.S. 
Now there's another case, Wilkinson v. FBI. And I

27:06.235 --> 27:11.042
went back to those hearings in Georgia in 56, 58.

27:14.968 --> 27:23.080
And I find out we'd agreed with the ACLU, all I would 
do was to, they

27:14.968 --> 27:23.080
ask your name and address. You give my name, but not 
my address. My name is Frank Wilkinson. Your

27:27.789 --> 27:29.391
address, please. On the base of the First 
Amendment, I refuse to answer this question or any

27:29.411 --> 27:34.057
other question of your committee. At that point, 
Richard Ahrens, the fundamentalist right-wing

27:36.099 --> 27:55.823
general counsel of the UAC, puts in two and a half 
pages of the congressional record where the

27:36.099 --> 27:55.823
contempt citation was voted, laying a 
legislative framework for having brought the

27:36.099 --> 27:55.823
question to me. It is not a witch hunt, because I'm 
down there trying to keep HUAC from putting the red

27:57.220 --> 28:06.112
label on Martin King. It is entirely that we are 
investigating oversight regarding the recent

28:07.093 --> 28:26.198
court decisions affecting the Internal Security 
Act of 1950, Title I, Title II, the Voorhees Act,

28:07.093 --> 28:26.198
the Smith Act, etc. They were all checking those 
laws out, and therefore they had to ask questions

28:28.883 --> 28:35.951
in order to advise Congress on how to improve the 
laws. Every bit of it was done with a statutory

28:36.932 --> 28:40.856
basis. But you get the FBI files on me. There were 12 
separate prosecutive summaries sent by Hoover to

28:42.998 --> 28:55.451
the Justice Department to prosecute me. Never 
just I mean, I would say that he hated my

28:57.329 --> 29:06.362
integration work, and he didn't like my work to 
abolish the Inter-American Identities

28:57.329 --> 29:06.362
Committee. And so it's a personal vendetta on an 
individual. And

29:08.865 --> 29:19.020
when you get these prosecuting summaries, which I 
have, there are six of them in that pile of papers

29:08.865 --> 29:19.020
you have right there. Under the FOIA, you get these 
documents. In every case, it's not just a wild...

29:26.641 --> 29:53.712
accusation against me they claimed that under the 
fbi's responsibility to enforce the federal

29:26.641 --> 29:53.712
criminal statutes namely smith act the police act 
security act county's control act we have

29:26.641 --> 29:53.712
investigated mr wilkins and we find that he is 
guilty of so-and-so they provide what all the

29:26.641 --> 29:53.712
agents that were following me at that time turn in 
all their stuff Hoover puts it into one three-page

29:54.367 --> 30:01.215
summary and turns it over for prosecution for my 
violating one of the acts. It's very important to

30:01.235 --> 30:04.459
know it's done that way. And then each of these was 
rejected. Twelve separate attorneys general,

30:08.744 --> 30:23.040
both Republican and Democrat, write back to 
Hoover saying the evidence you have submitted

30:08.744 --> 30:23.040
shows no indication of violation of federal 
criminal statutes on the part of Mr. Wilkinson. I

30:25.096 --> 30:37.734
throw this out to you because now we're building up 
a similar legislative history regarding the use

30:25.096 --> 30:37.734
of the word terrorism, and that's really the 
argument that I was making in Harvard. Because

30:38.716 --> 30:51.795
these witch hunts, these inquisitorial 
committees, these repressive laws

30:54.492 --> 31:05.423
are all done by men and women who maintain the 
pretense that we're a system, a government of

30:54.492 --> 31:05.423
laws. Yeah. It isn't just like, go get them, go 
smear them, go get Martin Luther King's sex life,

31:07.585 --> 31:14.152
go cop them. They always give you a legislative 
basis for doing what they're doing. And now that

31:19.758 --> 31:22.761
those laws have been declared either 
unconstitutional or unenforceable, which all of

31:23.281 --> 31:28.646
them have been. When they get around to 1981,

31:30.367 --> 31:51.246
five years after HUAC is abolished and Strom 
Thurmond revives HUAC in the Senate Judiciary

31:30.367 --> 31:51.246
Subcommittee, they find that there is no 
statutory basis that's solid enough in the word

31:30.367 --> 31:51.246
communism or certainly the word un-American, 
which doesn't even fly anymore. So it's called the

31:55.900 --> 31:59.405
Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism. And 
when Hoover

32:00.406 --> 32:20.592
dies in 72, and Gerald Ford knocks out the

32:00.406 --> 32:20.592
FBI's quintile probe on political surveillance, 
and begins to turn the FBI around to a federal

32:00.406 --> 32:20.592
bureau of criminal investigation. It was his 
attorney general, Levy,

32:22.723 --> 32:32.792
under Ford, that gives us the protections. But in 
1983,

32:32.812 --> 32:49.428
William Fred Smith, attorney general under 
Reagan, now Meese, writes new guidelines that

32:32.812 --> 32:49.428
overturns Gerald Ford's guidelines. I think it's 
important. that it's a Republican today who's

32:50.592 --> 32:55.977
turning the clock back on a good Republican we had 
in 1976. And Reagan's new guidelines state that

32:57.759 --> 33:06.969
the FBI shall investigate all violations of 
federal criminal law, which is where they should

32:57.759 --> 33:06.969
stop. Nothing more, except maybe to repeal what we 
call the speech crimes. But get rid of the speech

33:16.518 --> 33:18.721
crimes and enforce the law. That's what the FBI 
should do. But then he doesn't. That is point A. B,

33:23.683 --> 33:28.049
the FBI shall investigate all terrorist 
enterprises. And that is the basis of what Mies is

33:29.731 --> 33:38.383
doing in infiltrating the church movement, the 
sanctuary, the Central America Peace Movement,

33:29.731 --> 33:38.383
and so on. The only thing I want to add for this 
record, and I did it not in Texas, where it might be

33:39.565 --> 33:51.160
popular, but I did it in Massachusetts in... Ted 
Kennedy's home district, a block away from the

33:51.545 --> 33:55.649
Kennedy School of Government. The guidelines 
that Ronald Reagan and William Brent Smith

33:57.130 --> 34:19.611
formalized in March of 1983 were copied after an 
original draft, which was never approved, done by

33:57.130 --> 34:19.611
Jimmy Carter in 1979 under his attorney general, 
Ben Civilletti, And the Carter Charter was

34:20.435 --> 34:28.586
written by and introduced by Senator Ted Kennedy. 
It was the liberals, Kennedy, Carter,

34:30.028 --> 34:42.425
Civilletti, that first came up with this loose 
word, terrorist enterprise, which goes to the

34:30.028 --> 34:42.425
heart of political dissent. It is undefined. I 
mean, we have all the laws we need for the FBI to stop

34:43.847 --> 34:49.935
terrorism. dynamiting, possession, 
kidnapping, hijacking. Those were all the books.

34:56.231 --> 34:57.833
Let the FBI enforce the law. That's what is needed. 
The church committee, late Senator Frank Church,

35:02.520 --> 35:12.455
committee report, which is so valuable, sort of 
the bible of the abuse of power by J. Edgar Hoover.

35:14.197 --> 35:19.585
They brought out the fact that in Chicago, from 
1966 to

35:22.822 --> 35:36.920
The FBI had 1,012 informants,

35:22.822 --> 35:36.920
political informants, on political 
surveillance in Chicago. They spent $2,500,000

35:36.940 --> 35:41.186
paying those informants. During that period of 
time, there were over 1,000 gangland murders in

35:42.007 --> 35:50.398
Chicago that were never caught by the FBI. in New 
York at the same time. There was one period in New

35:54.861 --> 36:06.497
York where the FBI had 404

35:54.861 --> 36:06.497
agents on the communist detail, and only four on 
organized crime. This is fact. This is out of

36:10.222 --> 36:11.644
congressional? Church Valley Report. Okay. Very 
basic. Incredible. The American Bar Association

36:21.665 --> 36:36.781
which, you know, is the respectable bar unit, you 
know, the officers of the court in our old system,

36:21.665 --> 36:36.781
did a critique of William French Smith's 
guidelines in 1983. And they asked correctly, why

36:38.023 --> 36:46.372
the need for this special focus on terrorism? Why 
does there need to be a special but why not just the

36:49.643 --> 36:51.965
federal criminal statutes? And they invite Judge 
Webster, the current director of the FBI, to come

36:52.606 --> 37:02.877
before the ABA and to tell them, what is the need for 
this? Do you need extra money to fight terrorism?

37:08.663 --> 37:17.393
And what is the empirical data to support such a 
concentration drive on domestic terrorism? And

37:18.474 --> 37:19.515
Judge Webster tells the ABA, this is a better 
public record, I do not need any more money to fight

37:19.698 --> 37:27.706
terrorism. Terrorism is a low priority. In 1981 
there were, these are very close to exact, in 1981

37:31.149 --> 37:42.720
there were 51 terrorist cases in the United 
States. In 1982 there were 40. In 1983, 31. In 1984,

37:46.444 --> 37:49.587
5. Well, there's no basis for it. It's a guise for 
silencing dissent. The international terrorist

37:56.154 --> 38:15.085
problem is being exploited by Reagan and by 
expedients, by Carter and Kennedy, as a means of

37:56.154 --> 38:15.085
rationalizing some control on dissent in this 
country. And, you know, I give this to you

38:16.803 --> 38:23.869
hurriedly in my capsule, but I've prepared very 
carefully for my lecture here. I'm dealing with

38:23.929 --> 38:30.535
300 of the brightest young law students in the 
country last Saturday. And I look at them, they're

38:31.816 --> 38:36.180
all, you know, under 25. They don't know these 
things. I know it. So I went back and pulled out the

38:39.863 --> 38:45.848
statutory, the legislative history to show how 
their generation is going to be impacted by these

38:46.587 --> 39:02.048
Reagan guidelines unless they get involved in 
civil liberties work and fight for the right to

38:46.587 --> 39:02.048
dissent. I have another question, and that is, 
that deals with the relationship between you and

39:02.809 --> 39:14.164
your organization, National Committee to 
Abolish HUAC, And the other one that you repeat, I

39:15.528 --> 39:21.154
don't get the question. I have another question. 
And that is the relationship between the National

39:23.577 --> 39:42.438
Committee to Abolish HUAC and then Carl and the 
movement, the anti-war movement, the women's

39:23.577 --> 39:42.438
liberation movement, the civil rights movement, 
what's basically called the movement in the

39:23.577 --> 39:42.438
1960s. What kinds of roles I know that you were 
working still very diligently to abolish HUAC

39:44.840 --> 39:51.888
during that time, but what else did you, and did you 
join in? What kind of relations did you have with

39:51.928 --> 39:55.893
the anti-war movement, the student movement, 
etc.? It's a very, very thoughtful question,

39:56.394 --> 40:13.834
because much of those movements in the 60s had an 
element that was anti-

40:15.113 --> 40:18.317
the word, not legislative politics, but 
electoral politics. Anti-electoral politics.

40:21.981 --> 40:28.649
My own kids, for example, dropped out of Cal and San 
Francisco State to become trade unions. The

40:28.669 --> 40:32.794
academic world was not real. And many, many people 
were turned off by electoral politics. The idea of

40:39.763 --> 40:43.247
lobbying to influence a member of Congress to stop 
the Vietnam War, or in our case, to abolish UAC,

40:45.033 --> 40:52.961
it's like we're hopelessly naïve people who don't 
know what's going on. Yeah. We held our, N. Carl's

40:56.024 --> 41:01.410
strength has been focused. Our strength is the 
fact that we're absolutist on principle. We do not

41:06.655 --> 41:12.441
deviate

41:06.655 --> 41:12.441
a bit in regard to the political content of the Bill 
of Rights. We do not, as many people say, well, you

41:16.620 --> 41:27.469
know, all speech is all right except maybe a little 
bit, we ought to do something about the Nazis or the

41:16.620 --> 41:27.469
plan. We don't ever get near that. On wiretapping, 
where Ted Kennedy came up with a wiretapping bill a

41:29.791 --> 41:38.159
couple years ago, we fought it. All right, that's 
one thing. The second thing is, that we focus. We

41:45.461 --> 41:53.209
take the most imminent and dangerous issue for 
civil liberties at any one time, and then we focus.

41:54.371 --> 41:56.453
We don't try to cover the whole field. Now, during 
the 60s, we always have argued that civil

41:58.075 --> 42:12.330
liberties are indivisible to peace. Civil 
liberties are indivisible to civil rights, or

42:12.968 --> 42:17.434
whatever the movements are. During the civil 
rights struggles, Ann Braden, N. Carl officer,

42:17.474 --> 42:31.451
wrote our booklet called HUAC, Bulwark of 
Segregation, in which we brought together the

42:17.474 --> 42:31.451
civil rights movement and civil liberties. Today 
on our board of officers, we have John Lewis, the

42:32.252 --> 42:42.705
first president of SNCC, Julian Bond, the PR guy in 
SNCC, now a senator in Georgia, C.T. Vivian, who

42:43.861 --> 42:47.106
was director of affiliates for Martin Luther 
King. They're all our officers because we related

42:47.126 --> 42:53.976
the civil rights struggles with civil liberties. 
And Martin King's statement the night we went to

42:53.996 --> 42:58.663
jail is the classic. On the peace movement, always 
the same, but we had to do an awful lot of education.

43:05.834 --> 43:12.203
In 1962, right after I got out of prison, I came back 
to Los Angeles. And you

43:13.499 --> 43:29.323
held a hearing against students at three of our 
colleges, some student peace activity or I don't

43:13.499 --> 43:29.323
know what it was. Yeah. We had done such an 
organizing job among students that when the

43:30.304 --> 43:42.122
hearing was held, we had the long-standing 
federal building surrounded on four sides that

43:30.304 --> 43:42.122
makes 20 story building, four of us were students 
going around there. Beautiful demonstration,

43:47.141 --> 43:50.884
something you never saw during the silent 
fifties. It came by 62. It began in 1960

43:52.887 --> 44:00.454
when we had the first demonstration. I'm actually 
accused of organizing the so-called riot at San

44:00.554 --> 44:10.725
Francisco City Hall where the students were 
washed down the stairs of the city hall. That's

44:10.975 --> 44:17.525
when it began, after Carol Chessman, and after the 
Greensboro Civil Rights guy. I trace all of the

44:17.545 --> 44:26.359
development of the student movements to the 
Greensboro black students who fought for the

44:17.545 --> 44:26.359
World Restoration. I think that's where it began. 
But by 1962, they're there. Now, that morning,

44:30.465 --> 44:38.738
I've been working for years with a group starting 
about 1960. called Women Strike for Peace, headed

44:39.359 --> 44:43.303
up by Dagmar Wilson. They were fighting Kennedy at 
that point for his bomb test in the Pacific, and

44:43.664 --> 44:53.975
getting nowhere with it. And so they had decided, 
as a tactic, that if anyone should read in the

44:53.995 --> 45:08.792
papers that Kennedy had dropped another bomb in 
South Pacific, I mean a test of a bomb in the South

44:53.995 --> 45:08.792
Pacific, that without any further word, All 100 
members of WISP, Women's Strike for Peace, would

45:09.734 --> 45:14.620
come to the federal building. They'd wear white 
dresses, and they'd carry a red rose or a yellow

45:15.340 --> 45:25.052
rose, something like that, and do a vigil against 
Kennedy. The night before the U.S. hearings

45:25.072 --> 45:31.079
began, Kennedy dropped a bomb, passed a bomb. The 
next morning, promptly at 9 o'clock, from all over

45:31.099 --> 45:39.268
the city, without even a phone call, are 100 women 
in white dresses, with little red roses to

45:39.653 --> 45:42.495
protest. They get down there, and they can't get 
near the Federal Building because the students

45:43.036 --> 45:51.603
are four abreast all around it. They don't know the 
students. They do know me. So they call me, come

45:56.707 --> 46:05.155
across the street to them, and they said, Frank, 
Kennedy has tested another bomb. We're down here

46:05.915 --> 46:09.238
to do a vigil. Could you ask the students to make 
some room so we can do a vigil in front of the Federal

46:09.893 --> 46:21.226
Building there against Kennedy?" And I turned and 
said, look at that. How can you, how can you do that?

46:27.032 --> 46:32.959
There's no place you can, the building, the 
headline of the day said, HUAC used a freight

46:27.032 --> 46:32.959
elevator. You can get in the building. They had to 
use a freight elevator to get into the building. I

46:38.632 --> 46:40.655
said, come on over and join them. And they said, no, 
that would confuse the issues between HUAC and the

46:42.197 --> 46:51.850
Kennedy bomb testing. We cannot confuse the 
issues. That was April of 62. On December the 6th of

46:56.597 --> 47:07.812
62, I got a phone call from Dagmar Wilson in 
Washington saying, HUAC has just subpoenaed the

47:08.197 --> 47:12.503
entire leadership of Women's Strike for Peace, 
will you come back and help us?" And I went back to

47:13.545 --> 47:14.646
help. They didn't need any help. They did the most 
magnificent opposition I'd ever seen, where all

47:16.088 --> 47:21.996
these women go into a U.I. hearing, bring their 
babies with unchanged diapers, and put all the

47:22.037 --> 47:32.331
women in the front row, and when the first witness 
is called, by signal, every woman change his dirty

47:32.902 --> 47:35.714
diapers in front of UX. Stench was greater than UX. 
But, this is your question. Yeah. Closed

47:40.634 --> 47:41.699
