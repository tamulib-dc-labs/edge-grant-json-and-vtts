WEBVTT

00:03.305 --> 00:07.070
I see testing, testing, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

00:07.671 --> 00:10.174
Testing, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

00:12.878 --> 00:16.723
This is Thursday, March the 8th, I believe.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.946
And I'm at 2405.

00:18.967 --> 00:19.507
3405.

00:19.527 --> 00:21.570
3405 Parkway Terrace.

00:21.610 --> 00:25.636
Terrace, Parkway Terrace.

00:25.736 --> 00:26.337
In Bryan.

00:26.817 --> 00:30.983
And I have the honor and pleasure of chatting with Dr. Claude Goswick.

00:31.587 --> 00:35.137
the former director of the campus health center.

00:35.237 --> 00:36.119
Is that the right facility?

00:36.139 --> 00:36.781
That's right.

00:36.801 --> 00:37.182
That's right.

00:37.623 --> 00:45.023
To begin with, Claude, to introduce yourself to any reader or hearer,

00:45.543 --> 00:51.268
Describe your growing up, background, school, where, when.

00:51.869 --> 00:55.032
Just tell all about yourself before you came to College Station.

00:55.773 --> 01:12.428
I was born and raised in Durham, in Durham County, North Carolina, and went to schools there, including kindergarten, because when you mentioned kindergarten, I couldn't help but recall my own kindergarten days.

01:12.408 --> 01:23.497
and went to Duke all eight years, four of undergraduate, four of medical school.

01:23.998 --> 01:34.687
My mother was a nurse and worked at the hospital in the private surgical clinic, so I didn't even need a car, and I rode out with her and back.

01:36.308 --> 01:41.993
And then I...

01:41.973 --> 02:01.382
Well, I received a notice from the draft board to the effect that because I had been deferred because of being in school, and I received a notice from them that I should get a commission or I would be drafted.

02:02.172 --> 02:03.835
I did.

02:03.855 --> 02:06.639
I was lucky enough to get six months.

02:07.441 --> 02:08.543
No, no, I beg your pardon.

02:09.685 --> 02:10.566
I left something out.

02:11.107 --> 02:13.611
Probably one of the most interesting periods of my whole life.

02:14.412 --> 02:19.601
And that was when I was in Cincinnati in what was then called a rotating internship.

02:20.102 --> 02:21.364
It was at General Hospital.

02:22.266 --> 02:24.349
And I absolutely loved it.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.572
The people were wonderful.

02:26.732 --> 02:32.398
I worked harder than I ever had before in my life or than I ever have since.

02:33.479 --> 02:35.001
But I loved every minute of it.

02:36.342 --> 02:38.384
And if I had the stamina, I would do it again.

02:38.444 --> 02:48.355
But anyway, then I came back to Duke in what I thought I wanted to practice, and that was pediatrics.

02:48.375 --> 02:52.159
I had six months of residency there in pediatrics.

02:52.139 --> 02:55.202
And for one thing, I realized that was not for me.

02:55.463 --> 02:58.086
I didn't really, really like it all that well.

02:58.966 --> 03:01.669
So I decided that was a good time to go into the service.

03:02.691 --> 03:05.754
And I'd always heard that the Air Force was nice to be in.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.856
And so I did.

03:07.896 --> 03:12.181
And sure enough, it was nice because I was stationed in Bermuda.

03:13.502 --> 03:14.203
And this is when?

03:14.323 --> 03:18.568
This is in, oh gee, 58.

03:21.383 --> 03:40.069
59, if I, no, no, that's, yeah, it could be, no, no, medical school in 55, 56 in Cincinnati, 57, would have been probably 58, 58.

03:40.610 --> 03:43.033
I was there for two and a half years.

03:44.435 --> 03:45.396
I met Wasey there.

03:45.436 --> 03:48.100
We were married there.

03:49.042 --> 03:54.129
And we honeymooned from there, courtesy, incidentally, of the Air Force.

03:54.389 --> 03:55.611
Didn't cost us a penny.

03:56.132 --> 03:56.432
Oh, I see.

03:56.452 --> 03:57.774
Spell your wife's name.

03:57.794 --> 03:59.396
Louise, L-O-U-I-S-E.

03:59.416 --> 04:02.921
But I call her Weezy, W-E-Z-I-E.

04:04.663 --> 04:11.252
People can't do that because there's no Z in Louise, but that's the way we do it.

04:11.806 --> 04:22.232
But anyway, we honeymooned from there and we went, had two weeks in Europe, went all over the place, spent very little money.

04:22.894 --> 04:28.448
I think I saw most of Europe through the lens of my camera and she through the lens of her

04:28.428 --> 04:29.750
movie camera.

04:31.693 --> 04:44.595
But when we got home, her brother-in-law, her sister's husband, and her sister, we babysat for them, so to speak.

04:44.935 --> 04:47.820
The kids were young teenagers.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.464
And they took the same trip.

04:51.165 --> 04:55.713
He was a lieutenant colonel, but he was deputy base commander.

04:56.815 --> 04:58.157
I was a lowly captain.

04:58.217 --> 05:05.469
And we had no trouble whatsoever with connections.

05:05.509 --> 05:06.911
We were flying space available.

05:07.352 --> 05:09.075
They had all the trouble in the world.

05:09.575 --> 05:12.981
But they had no choice but to fly the same way that we did.

05:13.298 --> 05:18.252
Okay, then we came back through Charleston to North Carolina.

05:18.653 --> 05:28.320
I didn't know where I wanted to practice, but I knew by that time I wanted to do just general medicine, because that's what I'd done in Bermuda all that time.

05:28.300 --> 05:56.940
And we started out from Durham driving with intent of coming to Fort Worth, Wheezy's home, birthplace home, and stopping everywhere along the way that looked nice or that we'd heard about, looking in the yellow pages and seeing how many physicians they had compared to the population.

05:56.920 --> 06:03.484
The first one we got to that we really could have been seriously interested in was Marshall, Texas.

06:05.571 --> 06:09.124
But we thought very long and hard about that.

06:09.543 --> 06:13.952
But we decided to go on to Fort Worth, which is mother's home then.

06:13.992 --> 06:18.921
And then we did the same thing going back.

06:20.605 --> 06:24.773
We ended up in Hendersonville in North Carolina, western North Carolina.

06:26.015 --> 06:29.863
And wonderful, wonderful place.

06:30.316 --> 06:32.079
It was in the fall.

06:32.179 --> 06:33.801
As a matter of fact, it was Labor Day.

06:33.821 --> 06:41.312
And the weather was such that in the little motel we were staying in, the heat came on automatically at night.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.134
And it was September 2nd.

06:43.174 --> 06:44.116
I'll never forget it.

06:45.177 --> 06:47.020
Anyway, it was a very nice thing.

06:47.220 --> 06:51.686
And they had the annual Apple Festival there, so we watched the parade.

06:52.407 --> 06:53.649
Lots and lots of people.

06:53.669 --> 06:56.994
We, so we thought, oh, this is wonderful.

06:57.014 --> 06:58.416
You know, a little town.

06:58.396 --> 07:03.405
They don't roll up the sidewalks when it gets dark and that sort of thing.

07:04.146 --> 07:09.615
And to a certain extent, we found out that it was a little different.

07:09.956 --> 07:13.302
But it was a very, very cosmopolitan area.

07:13.722 --> 07:15.966
People there had a fair amount of money.

07:16.487 --> 07:17.569
They had traveled a lot.

07:17.589 --> 07:20.995
They were interesting to talk to and to work with and so forth.

07:21.430 --> 07:29.302
And I set up a general practice of medicine there and was there until 73.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.265
Now, what year was that, did you?

07:31.365 --> 07:33.388
That would have been, oh, boy.

07:39.698 --> 07:40.519
Fifty.

07:41.883 --> 07:48.016
I was there for 15 years and we left in 88.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.081
So that.

07:50.542 --> 07:51.824
No, you didn't leave there in 88.

07:51.844 --> 07:53.909
I don't mean 88, I beg your pardon, in 73.

07:54.250 --> 07:59.140
If that makes whatever that makes.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.746
So it would be 58.

08:01.766 --> 08:01.866
Yeah.

08:03.331 --> 08:14.403
I had bought a practice in medicine that was already established, so that was a help.

08:16.225 --> 08:27.718
And was just able to keep my head above water, so to speak, making payments on the loan that I got to buy the practice.

08:27.698 --> 08:32.027
But finally did get above water, so to speak.

08:32.789 --> 08:35.835
And by that time then, I had a heart attack.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.644
A real good bona fide heart attack.

08:40.766 --> 08:45.015
And after that, realized that was in about...

08:46.717 --> 08:51.261
I was 38 years old, I think.

08:52.823 --> 08:58.909
And then I realized then I'd have to start cutting down on my practice.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.911
So I decided it would be obstetrics.

09:01.171 --> 09:02.773
I wouldn't do obstetrics.

09:04.154 --> 09:07.117
I still made house calls because all physicians did then.

09:10.761 --> 09:14.344
But I got over my coronary fine, did very well.

09:14.324 --> 09:28.744
And got a letter from Hal Poe, who was director of the medical center down here, the health center on campus, in 73, you know, in 72.

09:31.007 --> 09:33.250
Met with him in Hendersonville.

09:33.310 --> 09:37.235
He came up there because he was from Greenville, South Carolina.

09:37.796 --> 09:39.198
So we met in Hendersonville.

09:39.298 --> 09:41.361
How did you know him before that?

09:41.341 --> 09:43.266
How did you come to get that letter?

09:45.792 --> 09:46.513
Good question.

09:46.654 --> 09:47.877
I really don't remember.

09:47.897 --> 09:56.998
I may have answered or classified Ed in a medical journal.

09:57.339 --> 09:59.063
I don't remember precisely.

09:59.043 --> 10:15.327
Anyway, I met him, enjoyed meeting him, and it was almost a conclusion right then and there that I would come down here and check the place out and make a decision.

10:18.191 --> 10:27.244
I thought, since I was working fairly hard, I thought perhaps this would be the obvious answer to my problem, that I would

10:27.224 --> 10:36.710
work regular hours and get regular paychecks that I could depend on and not have the hassle that I had up there.

10:37.111 --> 10:38.074
Well, did I ever?

10:38.836 --> 10:40.761
Was I ever mistaken?

10:41.095 --> 10:44.262
because I worked longer and harder than I think I ever have.

10:45.203 --> 10:47.228
At least I got the regular paychecks.

10:48.089 --> 10:53.180
As far as you recall, how did he describe the situation here?

10:53.501 --> 10:55.064
What did he tell you it was going to be like?

10:55.485 --> 11:01.517
He told me, and I already knew about the fact that it was primarily

11:01.835 --> 11:13.450
at least had been primarily a military institute, that it had plenty of females now, that it wasn't really agricultural and mechanical.

11:13.510 --> 11:14.751
I remember him saying that.

11:14.792 --> 11:25.345
And told me, it was about, I think he said about 15,000, 16,000 people then.

11:26.354 --> 11:35.386
And he didn't particularly care for College Station, so he wasn't very, very flattering about that.

11:36.728 --> 11:38.711
But in a lot of ways, I think he was right.

11:39.212 --> 11:41.935
How did he describe the people who were here?

11:42.036 --> 11:44.499
The people as being very, very nice.

11:44.519 --> 11:52.530
You know, he was, I didn't know it then, and he didn't tell me, but he was on the verge of a divorce, which is why he was leaving.

11:52.510 --> 12:05.366
And I didn't even know that, but at the time he was sleeping in the health center on a mattress on the floor, wasn't even living at home.

12:06.127 --> 12:07.129
But he loved the people.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.050
He loved the people.

12:08.370 --> 12:09.391
And he loved the students.

12:09.832 --> 12:14.518
Did, as far as you know, was he the one that made the decision of who his replacement would be?

12:16.085 --> 12:23.175
He knew he would be retiring, or at least that he would be leaving here.

12:24.156 --> 12:33.389
He assumed at that time that I would be, would take his place, would be Director of the Health Center.

12:33.650 --> 12:35.713
But he didn't, he was not the one who appointed me.

12:35.753 --> 12:37.976
John Colas was the one who appointed me.

12:38.877 --> 12:43.003
And it was not, I suppose Hal was here for,

12:42.983 --> 12:47.412
Oh, four or five months after I came.

12:47.472 --> 12:49.857
And so I was just on the staff.

12:50.298 --> 12:54.607
And we worked beautifully together at the old building, which I loved.

12:55.028 --> 12:55.589
I loved it.

12:56.010 --> 12:56.130
Right.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.495
Describe when you came to visit.

12:59.032 --> 12:59.894
your impression?

13:00.936 --> 13:03.843
Oh, I was very, very, very favorably impressed.

13:03.963 --> 13:04.664
I really was.

13:04.705 --> 13:14.165
I never had, I had not had any experience since I left Duke with this sort of an environment.

13:15.047 --> 13:17.192
And consequently,

13:17.172 --> 13:21.076
Didn't really have anything to compare it to.

13:21.517 --> 13:24.620
Duke is entirely different from this, as you perfectly well know.

13:27.163 --> 13:32.009
But I fell in love with it, really, right off the bat.

13:32.529 --> 13:33.931
I knew this was what I wanted.

13:34.191 --> 13:35.493
Did you and your wife drive over?

13:35.693 --> 13:37.375
Yes, yes.

13:37.415 --> 13:43.722
See, she's from Fort Worth, so she had the— Did anyone show you all around?

13:44.483 --> 13:46.605
Well, Hal and his wife did.

13:46.585 --> 13:52.153
We met, I forget her name right off the, anyway.

13:53.034 --> 13:54.656
Anyway they showed us around.

13:56.899 --> 13:59.763
Frances Goff showed us around.

14:02.046 --> 14:02.567
Who was she?

14:03.067 --> 14:15.985
Frances was then and only oh maybe five years or so ago retired as Director of Nurses at the Health Center.

14:15.965 --> 14:19.088
I loved the old building.

14:19.589 --> 14:20.410
I really did.

14:20.450 --> 14:21.010
Describe it.

14:21.051 --> 14:25.716
It was plenty adequate then, there being maybe 16,000-odd students.

14:26.597 --> 14:27.698
It was run down.

14:27.758 --> 14:30.741
The plaster was off the walls.

14:32.763 --> 14:37.769
The nurses themselves had repainted the interior of it several times.

14:39.330 --> 14:40.211
Nobody helped them.

14:40.231 --> 14:41.753
They just did it themselves.

14:42.138 --> 14:51.960
There was one big ward upstairs, which is one I was used to at Cincinnati, a big ward with curtains, of course, between the beds.

14:52.301 --> 14:54.185
And there were a few private rooms.

14:55.969 --> 14:59.758
So that was my element that I knew about.

14:59.738 --> 15:04.723
and had some very, very interesting experiences.

15:05.084 --> 15:07.666
I'm already now on the staff.

15:08.527 --> 15:10.509
Wait, wait, let's still stay with the... Okay.

15:10.850 --> 15:12.091
With the... Okay.

15:12.151 --> 15:13.252
With the visiting experience.

15:13.272 --> 15:13.893
With the visiting.

15:14.354 --> 15:18.178
Now... I remember less of that than I do of the other thing.

15:19.679 --> 15:25.766
And I'm assuming that someone showed you all around and you spent the night somewhere, MSC?

15:26.106 --> 15:26.466
Yes.

15:27.808 --> 15:28.969
Was it the MSC?

15:31.784 --> 15:33.988
I suppose so.

15:34.088 --> 15:34.809
It had to be.

15:34.909 --> 15:36.372
What did the campus see?

15:36.392 --> 15:41.441
Because I have spent the night in the MSC, and there's no other time that I would have had the occasion to do that.

15:41.901 --> 15:43.985
What was your impression of the campus?

15:44.285 --> 15:45.207
Oh, I thought it was beautiful.

15:45.447 --> 15:46.028
I really did.

15:46.109 --> 15:48.713
And do you remember whom you met on that first trip?

15:50.060 --> 15:52.664
I met John, of course, met Perry.

15:54.107 --> 15:54.608
Who?

15:54.848 --> 15:55.890
Perry, Howard Perry.

15:56.010 --> 15:56.631
Howard Perry.

15:56.651 --> 15:56.851
Who is it?

15:56.871 --> 15:57.512
Collin Perry.

15:57.613 --> 15:58.995
Yeah, yeah.

16:00.057 --> 16:04.845
And I think I met Maylon Sutherland then.

16:04.865 --> 16:16.624
I know I met Carolyn Adair, although she was not director of student activities then.

16:17.988 --> 16:21.012
Because Koldis would have been comparatively new at that point.

16:21.053 --> 16:22.174
He was comparatively new.

16:22.234 --> 16:34.012
As a matter of fact, he is about my age, and I remember doing a physical exam on him for workman's compensation, which we did on all employees, old and new.

16:34.032 --> 16:38.258
I hated that.

16:38.238 --> 16:39.159
Nevertheless.

16:39.360 --> 16:45.949
And it was made clear to you, I presume, that you would report directly to him?

16:46.009 --> 16:47.170
Yes, yes.

16:47.951 --> 16:52.898
And how did they officially make the offer of the position?

16:53.499 --> 16:59.487
Was it by letter, by phone call, in conversation with him?

16:59.467 --> 17:03.011
In all honesty, I don't remember a phone call or a letter.

17:03.031 --> 17:07.717
There must have been a letter, which I certainly no longer have.

17:09.579 --> 17:17.589
But I think there was sort of a consensus right then between all of us that I would be coming back.

17:19.511 --> 17:24.597
Were there any key points of consideration or negotiation?

17:26.399 --> 17:30.564
No, I think I made some assumptions about the working hours.

17:33.127 --> 17:39.014
I assumed that they were 8 to 5 rather than 8 to 8.

17:40.136 --> 17:45.862
And when they made the offer, this is the only dollar question I'm going to ask, what was the beginning salary?

17:47.524 --> 17:48.846
I think it was about

17:49.940 --> 18:00.352
35,000, 40,000 maybe, which was less than I was making in North Carolina.

18:00.372 --> 18:06.279
But of course, I realized I'd have no expenses, I'd have no supplies, I'd have no salaries to pay.

18:06.339 --> 18:08.522
So it really amounted to more.

18:09.643 --> 18:17.112
And as it turned out, I got raises every year, as you know how things go.

18:17.092 --> 18:25.822
As a matter of fact, at one time, I always made more money than John Colas did, that is on paper, on the budget.

18:26.703 --> 18:35.072
And I talked with him about that one time and I thought, you, I really shouldn't be making more money than my boss is making.

18:35.813 --> 18:38.837
And he said, let me take care of that and let me worry about that.

18:39.738 --> 18:41.800
And so it never came up again.

18:41.780 --> 18:51.952
Did he or anyone else in your early, either before you officially began or soon after, give you any directives, any guidelines?

18:54.195 --> 18:54.756
No.

18:55.717 --> 19:08.192
No, I think we, Hal and I talked enough and John and I talked enough to know that I was interested

19:08.830 --> 19:17.478
and that I could probably do the job administratively as well as medically.

19:18.699 --> 19:23.363
And I think we just all came to that conclusion.

19:24.604 --> 19:26.025
I should remember that, shouldn't I?

19:26.065 --> 19:26.706
But I don't.

19:26.866 --> 19:31.590
Well, I think if there had been any real ironclad, you would have remembered.

19:32.291 --> 19:36.795
And describe the, when you got here, describe the staff.

19:37.923 --> 19:39.747
of the health center?

19:40.869 --> 19:43.574
Dan, shoot, I forget his last name.

19:43.594 --> 19:47.542
There were two more, two others of us.

19:49.025 --> 19:50.127
MDs?

19:50.468 --> 19:50.868
MDs.

19:52.852 --> 19:56.860
We were grossly understaffed right from the very start.

19:58.426 --> 20:00.209
Dan, Dan, Dan.

20:00.249 --> 20:02.132
He died within a year.

20:02.152 --> 20:05.277
And that left two of us.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.845
So of course it was really desperate then.

20:10.905 --> 20:16.013
We had to hire more people.

20:17.292 --> 20:34.296
Unfortunately, at the rate or the salary that I was able, as director of the health center then, could offer new people, a prospective physician, I couldn't get anybody.

20:36.739 --> 20:37.140
Well, I

20:38.386 --> 20:39.868
I had no real choices.

20:40.829 --> 20:43.072
I sort of had to take whoever applied.

20:43.973 --> 20:44.814
Very few did.

20:44.874 --> 20:54.886
But we at least finally got back up to about five on the staff when we moved into the new building, which was the next year.

20:56.748 --> 20:57.509
What about nurses?

20:58.069 --> 21:00.672
Nurse-wise, we were pretty, pretty well off.

21:02.334 --> 21:07.060
We, because of the rapid, right then, the rapid growth,

21:07.040 --> 21:14.355
The student population must have, oh, at least nearly doubled in the next few years.

21:16.479 --> 21:19.165
We hired some nurses as well.

21:19.706 --> 21:22.131
It was an excellent, excellent group of nurses.

21:22.191 --> 21:23.533
They got along well together.

21:23.594 --> 21:24.335
They worked well.

21:24.776 --> 21:26.820
They worked well with the physicians.

21:26.800 --> 21:35.040
The physicians, I'll be perfectly honest, did not work as well together or with everybody else.

21:37.406 --> 21:44.202
Here I definitely won't name any names even though I can remember them and will probably remember them until I die.

21:44.182 --> 21:54.648
They were, for the most part, I'm sure they felt as I had felt when I came, that I would be working less.

21:55.089 --> 21:58.477
They expected to work less and they did work less.

21:59.981 --> 22:00.823
I won't

22:02.575 --> 22:09.065
I want to use the term lazy, but I'll be a little kinder than that.

22:10.707 --> 22:16.897
They just sort of expected to work a few hours and did, and just simply would walk out.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.544
Describe the normal routine.

22:21.584 --> 22:24.469
Was there someone there on a shift?

22:25.570 --> 22:26.011
Oh, yes.

22:26.191 --> 22:26.672
Absolutely.

22:26.912 --> 22:27.253
Always.

22:28.294 --> 22:30.017
And usually it was me.

22:31.263 --> 22:40.120
This is where I have to warn you that this may sound like bragging, but it's not bragging.

22:40.762 --> 22:43.226
I wanted to make it all even.

22:43.266 --> 22:45.711
I wanted everybody to do the same amount of work.

22:46.112 --> 22:49.238
I didn't mind doing the administrative end of it, of course.

22:49.218 --> 23:00.011
But I'm talking, when I say work, I'm thinking in terms of the daily process of seeing patients as one would in a private office.

23:01.472 --> 23:02.894
That's what I wanted them to do.

23:04.816 --> 23:14.708
And consequently, I had it set up such that all nights were covered all night long.

23:16.009 --> 23:17.571
All weekends were covered.

23:17.787 --> 23:32.185
all weekend long, most holidays when practically everybody but, what's the,

23:33.700 --> 23:36.105
maintenance people and that sort of thing.

23:36.245 --> 23:38.389
Everybody else got that vacation.

23:38.850 --> 23:39.912
We were open.

23:41.615 --> 23:45.583
We did close Christmas, but for a shorter period of time than they do now.

23:46.685 --> 23:51.574
And I must say that changed very, very fast when I left.

23:51.554 --> 23:54.999
Namely, that they started taking all kinds of holidays.

23:55.399 --> 23:57.302
They stopped taking any night call.

23:58.323 --> 24:00.266
They stopped taking any weekend call.

24:00.486 --> 24:01.267
No, no.

24:01.508 --> 24:11.301
There was a transition period wherein they hired a private agency to do a night and weekend call.

24:11.321 --> 24:12.042
That's what it was.

24:12.623 --> 24:16.468
And now, to my knowledge, that's all stopped.

24:16.629 --> 24:17.730
They don't do it anymore.

24:17.710 --> 24:20.153
When you got here.

24:21.094 --> 24:33.389
The thing about it is, and I want to say this, the reason I say that I did it is because it was something that had to be done, and I could always, not always, depend on its getting done.

24:33.429 --> 24:36.853
Did it mean that an M.D.

24:36.993 --> 24:42.520
was present there during the night, or was the home on call?

24:47.140 --> 24:48.001
Home on call.

24:48.361 --> 24:48.922
Home on call.

24:49.363 --> 24:55.610
Although the first two weeks that I was down here, I lived in the health center.

24:56.251 --> 24:57.452
I had nowhere else to live.

24:57.512 --> 25:00.836
And so I was there all the time.

25:01.697 --> 25:07.885
But no, it was being on call all night and all weekend.

25:08.826 --> 25:16.675
And I thought we were going to rotate, you know, as evenly as possible the schedule.

25:17.026 --> 25:21.615
Describe some of your first Aggie real-world experiences.

25:23.799 --> 25:27.446
Probably in the old health center, the most vivid ones.

25:27.466 --> 25:35.642
I remember there was an elevator.

25:36.196 --> 25:39.163
service at the health center was on the second floor.

25:39.885 --> 25:49.648
And I suppose, I don't know, that that was built to make sure that the nurses were not on the first floor at night, which is in fact the case.

25:50.049 --> 25:53.698
So, of course, we always knew when someone was coming up the elevator.

25:53.678 --> 26:10.264
And I'll never forget when I, one of the first few nights I spent on campus, I looked out the window about three or four o'clock in the morning, and I saw this tremendous, tremendous billow of smoke, what I thought was smoke.

26:10.284 --> 26:15.012
It was vapor, of course, from the air conditioners, but there was no noise.

26:14.992 --> 26:16.154
There were no sirens.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.581
And I thought, well, no, the place is not really burning down.

26:19.601 --> 26:25.332
And so I finally realized that.

26:26.595 --> 26:30.863
But I also remember I was sitting one evening eating supper.

26:31.184 --> 26:35.953
They always brought it up to me because the kitchen was in the basement.

26:37.587 --> 26:43.994
A storm came up and I was sitting there at the desk eating.

26:44.054 --> 26:46.396
The window was up a little bit like that.

26:46.476 --> 26:56.747
I really, I guess pure stupidity now as I look back on it, didn't realize that my feet were in water that deep, that it was leaking in.

26:56.807 --> 27:02.233
So that was an interesting experience.

27:02.733 --> 27:04.475
I loved the ward experience.

27:04.555 --> 27:06.497
I really did.

27:08.182 --> 27:16.497
Let me think, if something outstanding that I can think of occurred as we were over at the old health center, I'll let you know.

27:17.158 --> 27:21.246
But, oh, we always served ourselves.

27:21.486 --> 27:22.528
It was illegal.

27:23.116 --> 27:25.819
We weren't supposed to go in the kitchen, of course.

27:25.859 --> 27:29.823
The health codes disallowed that, but we did it anyway.

27:29.903 --> 27:35.849
They had pots this big and this deep, and we went into the kitchen and served ourselves.

27:37.291 --> 27:41.896
We had three cooks then, wonderful, wonderful people.

27:41.956 --> 27:47.942
They stayed with us the whole time when we moved.

27:47.922 --> 28:08.125
We ate in a little dining area, not an ordinary-shaped room, but the roof slanted severely like that, down to the old front steps of the health center, which were never used then.

28:08.105 --> 28:10.408
And there was a family of skunks out there.

28:11.329 --> 28:13.733
And we could see these skunks playing in the hole.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.695
There was ivy, of course, on the ground.

28:16.396 --> 28:18.219
And we could see them and watch them grow.

28:18.259 --> 28:28.172
And we could see the baby skunks get up on the edge of their hole and teeter-totter like that.

28:28.152 --> 28:36.080
And not really, they couldn't walk yet well, and we would see them teeter-totter, and then they'd fall into the hole.

28:36.720 --> 28:40.044
But we saw that family of skunks grow up.

28:40.444 --> 28:43.847
Now this building was just north of the YMCA.

28:44.968 --> 28:45.489
Is that right?

28:46.610 --> 28:47.351
Going towards Cebiza?

28:47.371 --> 28:47.671
North.

28:48.191 --> 28:55.058
It was right across the street from the fountain and where the old president's home was.

28:55.078 --> 28:56.039
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:56.059 --> 28:56.740
Or Cebiza.

28:56.800 --> 28:57.080
Yeah.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.041
Cebiza.

28:58.021 --> 29:03.310
And how long was it before you learned what the nickname, Aggie nickname was for it?

29:04.632 --> 29:07.597
I suppose I must have learned that very early on.

29:08.178 --> 29:10.182
But I didn't take offense about it.

29:10.202 --> 29:11.864
No, I didn't take offense at it at all.

29:12.285 --> 29:15.971
Now the official title was the Texas A&M Health Center?

29:16.012 --> 29:16.753
Student Health Center.

29:16.773 --> 29:18.496
Student Health Center.

29:18.516 --> 29:23.404
And it could, its task was to care for the health

29:23.975 --> 29:25.236
students.

29:25.317 --> 29:26.478
Students.

29:26.758 --> 29:28.780
That was my interpretation.

29:30.122 --> 29:37.110
I had some experiences that you may or may not be interested in which involved taking care of other than students.

29:40.053 --> 29:40.374
Of course.

29:40.774 --> 29:46.000
And of course Jack Williams and

29:47.127 --> 29:48.468
What's Vandiver's first name?

29:48.989 --> 29:49.189
Frank.

29:49.209 --> 29:49.529
Frank.

29:49.549 --> 29:50.290
Frank Vandiver.

29:51.071 --> 29:56.356
But it also went down to, well, football games of course.

29:56.456 --> 29:59.499
We operated all the first aid stations there.

29:59.519 --> 30:11.210
And the one thing about that aspect of it that bothered me greatly was trying to take care of the board members when they were meeting.

30:12.010 --> 30:13.692
It irked me.

30:14.127 --> 30:16.912
Share any of those experiences.

30:16.932 --> 30:26.789
Oh, they would actually send over, send messengers over to the health center and say that they needed a physician over there, that someone had a cold or something like that.

30:26.850 --> 30:30.516
And occasionally they would come over to the health center.

30:30.496 --> 30:40.012
It happened seldom enough that I didn't refuse and I didn't say, sorry, this is just for students.

30:42.035 --> 30:45.962
Did some faculty and staff ever come over?

30:46.002 --> 30:49.448
At my discretion, uh-huh.

30:49.468 --> 30:49.568
Yeah.

30:50.358 --> 30:52.142
I invited them.

30:52.342 --> 30:53.765
Oh, okay.

30:54.246 --> 30:56.831
But there was not a problem of a bunch coming?

30:56.851 --> 30:57.853
Oh, of abuse?

30:58.294 --> 30:58.575
No.

30:59.156 --> 30:59.917
Absolutely not.

31:00.659 --> 31:00.899
No.

31:01.621 --> 31:07.793
As a matter of fact, Perry, for one in particular, always, although he

31:07.773 --> 31:15.491
John had assigned him the job of sort of overseeing how the health center operated.

31:16.514 --> 31:23.049
He was one who didn't like to appear at the health center.

31:23.089 --> 31:25.174
He didn't like it to appear that he...
