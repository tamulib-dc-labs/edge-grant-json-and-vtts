00:10.561 --> 00:14.005
Could you please introduce yourself and describe 
your current occupation? My name is John Dixon,

00:15.207 --> 00:19.532
Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army. I'm an 
intelligence officer with 21 years in the

00:20.874 --> 00:24.398
service. Could you describe the early part of your 
military career and how did you become interested

00:26.882 --> 00:34.872
in the field of military intelligence? I was first 
commissioned in the infantry.

00:39.063 --> 00:41.465
was not very pleased with the duty in the infantry. 
It wasn't what I considered to be a challenge

00:41.505 --> 00:47.191
mentally. It was very boring, I thought. And I had 
extensive contact in my first assignment in

00:49.654 --> 01:02.527
Berlin with intelligence officers, neighbors, 
friends, and people that I dealt with on the staff

00:49.654 --> 01:02.527
in Berlin Brigade. And after, I guess, two and a 
half years, I became convinced that I wanted to

01:03.588 --> 01:08.833
transfer to intelligence. I did that in 1967 and 
then went for training at Fort Holabird,

01:09.607 --> 01:19.864
Maryland, where I became an aerial surveillance 
officer. When were you stationed in Vietnam? I

01:22.529 --> 01:33.387
arrived in Vietnam January 22, 1968, and stayed

01:22.529 --> 01:33.387
there exactly one year, departing in January of 
1969. Before you stationed in Vietnam, what type

01:35.020 --> 01:44.170
of special training did you see that prepared you 
for your intelligence gathering in the Vietnam

01:35.020 --> 01:44.170
theater? When I arrived in Fort Holabird, 
Maryland in June of 1967, I went through a short

01:45.692 --> 02:04.572
course called the Intelligence Officers 
Orientation Course, which was designed to teach

01:45.692 --> 02:04.572
young officers the basics of tactical and combat 
intelligence. This included things like

02:05.328 --> 02:13.956
collection management, analysis, the various 
disciplines of intelligence. It really was very

02:13.976 --> 02:22.564
simply a vocabulary and a set of concepts that gave 
an officer an orientation. It was tailored. At

02:25.086 --> 02:35.115
this time, they had already started tailoring the 
course for Vietnam so that a lot of the stuff that we

02:25.086 --> 02:35.115
learned was designed to be used in Vietnam. I then 
attended a six-month-long course designed to

02:35.872 --> 02:42.101
train aerial surveillance operators. These 
officers basically are photo intelligence

02:43.242 --> 02:46.947
officers. This course taught the basics of 
photography from an aerial viewpoint, the

02:48.149 --> 03:04.512
various kinds of imagery and collection to 
include infrared, airborne radar, side-looking

02:48.149 --> 03:04.512
airborne radar. And it taught how these 
collectors could be exploited to find the enemy,

03:04.880 --> 03:13.047
identify the enemy, identify his activity. We 
learned how to identify enemy equipment from

03:14.349 --> 03:19.253
aerial photography. We learned how to plan aerial 
photography missions, how to debrief the flying

03:19.293 --> 03:30.303
crews, and how to produce the intelligence 
product that came from it. This course was not yet

03:35.137 --> 03:38.060
completely adapted to Vietnam.

03:40.522 --> 04:00.361
Most of the collectors that we had, the sensors 
that we had in aerial surveillance at the time were

03:40.522 --> 04:00.361
oriented more towards conventional warfare and 
the course had not yet caught up with the sudden

03:40.522 --> 04:00.361
change in technology that was going on at that time 
in Vietnam. So it really wasn't aimed at

04:02.255 --> 04:06.982
collection in Vietnam, although we may have spent 
a week or so on its application. It wasn't very

04:07.042 --> 04:08.905
applicable to Vietnam. What type of duties did you 
perform while stationed in Vietnam? When I first

04:15.535 --> 04:28.836
reported to Vietnam, because I had been an 
operations officer in the infantry, even though I

04:15.535 --> 04:28.836
was newly trained in intelligence, I was 
appointed assistant operations officer the

04:15.535 --> 04:28.836
first Military Intelligence Battalion Aerial 
Reconnaissance and Surveillance. This

04:34.185 --> 04:46.980
battalion was headquartered in Saigon, although 
it had detachments throughout Vietnam, from as

04:34.185 --> 04:46.980
far north as Da Nang down to the Delta in Can Tho, 
which is on the Mekong River. The mission of the

04:48.222 --> 04:59.295
MIBARS, as the unit was called, was to provide 
aerial reconnaissance support to the field army

04:48.222 --> 04:59.295
by providing liaison photographic products and 
intelligence reporting in conjunction with the

04:59.748 --> 05:13.605
Air Force who flew the majority of the aerial 
reconnaissance missions that we supported.

05:16.369 --> 05:20.254
What type of tasks did you perform while working in 
your second job? My second job was as intelligence

05:21.235 --> 05:27.763
officer or S2 of an infantry battalion. in the 1st 
Infantry Division. This was 2nd Battalion, 28th

05:29.245 --> 05:31.227
Infantry. The intelligence officer for an 
infantry battalion doesn't do very

05:33.230 --> 05:40.580
sophisticated intelligence work. The job there 
is to keep the commander informed as to the enemy

05:40.600 --> 05:57.683
activity in his area and in the areas adjacent to 
him, provide information to the commander on the

05:40.600 --> 05:57.683
terrain, on the weather, on known or suspected 
locations of enemy units, and to support

05:58.034 --> 06:06.622
operations and operations planning so that the 
commander can effectively use his troops. My job

06:06.642 --> 06:19.733
included coordination with higher headquarters 
to find out what intelligence picture they had, to

06:06.642 --> 06:19.733
try to find where they thought the enemy was, and 
this required constant flying back and forth to

06:06.642 --> 06:19.733
the headquarters. I did a lot of reconnaissance on 
my own, briefed patrols, debriefed the patrols,

06:27.599 --> 06:41.934
helped interrogate prisoners, flew scout 
missions myself, where we would hang out of the

06:27.599 --> 06:41.934
helicopter and try to find enemy tracks, enemy 
footprints in the mud, and that sort of thing, just

06:27.599 --> 06:41.934
in an effort to try to locate the enemy. You arrived 
in Vietnam right before the Tet Offensive. Did the

06:46.518 --> 06:52.965
military intelligence apparatus predict a New 
Year's Offensive by the Viet Cong and NVA? If they

06:54.683 --> 07:06.018
had predicted the Viet Cong attack during Tet of 
68, they didn't tell us about it because we had

06:54.683 --> 07:06.018
absolutely no forewarning. The first thing that I 
recall knowing about the Tet Offensive was waking

07:06.619 --> 07:13.628
up the morning of the attack to gunfire. And we were 
right in the midst of the NVA and Viet Cong

07:14.609 --> 07:23.020
regiments that had infiltrated into Saigon. If 
anyone knew about it, they gave us no warning. Now,

07:26.103 --> 07:36.934
I am told that units in the field that were closer to 
the intelligence picture out in the countryside

07:26.103 --> 07:36.934
saw something happening. But whether or not they 
called it or not is the question. And I don't

07:39.617 --> 07:44.382
believe most of them called an attack at that time. 
They felt something was happening, but none of

07:44.882 --> 07:52.230
them saw the magnitude or the significance of the 
attack. and the fact that the enemy would be able to

07:52.565 --> 08:10.832
get entire units into Saigon and conduct an attack 
that threatened the entire government and MacVie

07:52.565 --> 08:10.832
headquarters, Tan Son Nhat Air Base, and an attack 
that would really threaten and would involve just

07:52.565 --> 08:10.832
about everyone in Vietnam. Almost every unit was 
involved in the Tet Offensive in Vietnam. And I

08:15.219 --> 08:18.143
don't think anyone saw that coming. You're saying 
that there was some hint in the tactical military

08:22.130 --> 08:52.069
intelligence in the field that there was going to 
be an offensive but other operatives like the cia

08:22.130 --> 08:52.069
and other military intelligence gatherers were 
pretty much ignorant of the attack i don't think if

08:22.130 --> 08:52.069
anyone did know about it they they sure didn't pass 
the word around the uh i i had friends who were

08:22.130 --> 08:52.069
located at two field force headquarters and up in 
the first field force headquarters in the hill

08:22.130 --> 08:52.069
country in the mountains and have talked to them 
since and i have found very, very few people who

08:52.825 --> 08:56.091
said they saw it coming. Some folks in signals 
intelligence have said that they felt perhaps it

08:57.092 --> 09:02.922
was coming, and they had some indications. 
Everyone had indications that units were moving

09:03.463 --> 09:14.943
and that something was afoot, but I don't think 
anybody realized exactly what was happening or

09:03.463 --> 09:14.943
realized the magnitude of the attack that was 
coming. In other words, I think they were caught by

09:15.985 --> 09:17.888
surprise. How did U.S. intelligence personnel 
overcome the initial unfamiliarity with the

09:19.876 --> 09:27.884
local environment and inexperience with the 
enemy? Not very well. One

09:32.288 --> 09:39.716
thing you've got to remember is that everybody 
there was there for one year, usually. Now and then

09:39.876 --> 09:41.557
people would extend for more. And you just don't 
build up intelligence, experience, expertise,

09:42.699 --> 09:49.225
knowledge of the environment in that short period 
of time. The change in culture, the change in

09:53.061 --> 10:05.293
physical environment, the unusual physical 
environment, the fact that the enemy was at home

09:53.061 --> 10:05.293
and we were not, just handicapped our 
intelligence collection immensely.

10:08.036 --> 10:19.347
And as a result, we tended to rely more on technical 
collection devices, technology, rather than

10:08.036 --> 10:19.347
classical intelligence collection. We just 
didn't have our grasp or have our finger on the

10:19.715 --> 10:26.341
human aspect of intelligence in Vietnam. We 
didn't understand the Vietnamese and the way the

10:26.361 --> 10:29.845
Vietnamese thought. We didn't understand the 
Orientals in general. They were able to sell us a

10:32.948 --> 10:35.991
bill of goods quite frequently. For example, it 
was not uncommon for an agent, a Vietnamese or a

10:36.331 --> 10:48.523
Chinese agent in the Delta, for example, to be 
selling intelligence reports to five different

10:48.959 --> 10:54.768
intelligence collection agencies, sell the same 
report. We had no collection management, no

10:54.788 --> 10:59.335
source control, so that he could get away with 
that. And he could also manipulate us just to make

10:59.936 --> 11:03.802
money. After the Tet Offensive, the big issue was 
when would the next offensive come? And you could

11:08.830 --> 11:14.899
see very clear patterns when these intelligence 
entrepreneurs, these businessmen, would make

11:08.830 --> 11:14.899
money selling reports of the next Tet Offensive, 
because they would flow, you'd start to see the

11:15.115 --> 11:24.684
reports, April of 68 is going to be the big attack, 
and nothing happened in April of 68. And it was very

11:24.884 --> 11:28.567
clear that somebody was selling us a bill of goods. 
These multiple sources, the inability of the

11:29.789 --> 11:42.681
Americans to handle Vietnamese and Chinese 
agents effectively caused the human aspect of

11:29.789 --> 11:42.681
intelligence to mislead us. The technical 
collection, aerial surveillance, signal

11:44.697 --> 11:51.967
surveillance, they could never be exactly 
perfect. There's always going to be some

11:51.987 --> 11:53.949
ambiguity with them. And so you had no way to 
corroborate what you got from your sensors with a

11:53.969 --> 11:59.697
good human intelligence report. And combine that 
with the fact that the enemy was just very security

12:01.199 --> 12:04.303
conscious. It made it difficult. Are you 
suggesting that the intelligence officers and

12:06.727 --> 12:14.417
personnel should maybe have stayed in Vietnam and 
been for longer than a year? Any intelligence

12:16.067 --> 12:24.838
operation, in order for it to be effective, the 
operatives have to be there a long, long time. Now,

12:24.878 --> 12:25.719
there were some there. The CIA had people there for 
a long, long time. And the Green Berets would have

12:28.523 --> 12:31.526
people that would volunteer for a long time. But 
you're right. The one-year tour hurt us to that

12:33.489 --> 12:37.014
extent. It hurt us in other areas. It hurt us in 
combat effectiveness and other things. But it

12:40.097 --> 12:43.662
definitely hurt us in intelligence. It takes you 
six months to learn your area, maybe two or three

12:43.895 --> 12:51.885
months of effective work, and then you were 
getting short, and by then it was time to leave.

12:53.507 --> 12:56.650
Could you describe some of the high-tech devices 
you used to detect the enemy? Well, when I first got

12:57.632 --> 13:07.043
there, we had a package of reconnaissance sensors 
that were pretty standard.

13:07.383 --> 13:10.627
Aerial photography had become very 
sophisticated. You had some high-speed cameras

13:10.687 --> 13:13.851
and panoramic cameras and nose angle cameras in 
the aircraft that would give you extremely high

13:14.050 --> 13:21.319
and very, very good resolution. Their biggest 
problem was the fact that they wouldn't penetrate

13:22.080 --> 13:25.805
the jungle. And so we'd take miles and miles of film 
and have nice pictures of jungle and very high

13:25.825 --> 13:34.416
resolution, high quality imagery that wouldn't 
show us very much. We had just introduced

13:35.297 --> 13:41.946
infrared, airborne infrared, into the 
collection package. And this is mounted on on

13:43.345 --> 13:57.223
either a small aircraft owned by the Army called a 
Mohawk, or it was mounted in a RF-101 owned by the

13:43.345 --> 13:57.223
Air Force, the Mohawk would find campfires with 
this infrared. And that proved very effective in

13:57.703 --> 14:09.859
the early days because the Viet Cong at night would 
stop to rest, or during the day even, would stop to

13:57.703 --> 14:09.859
rest and cook their rice and cook their soup. And 
when they didn't realize what was going on, when

14:10.193 --> 14:24.132
they first introduced the sensor to Vietnam, it 
was extremely effective because one mission

14:10.193 --> 14:24.132
could reveal an entire bivouac area for North 
Vietnamese regiment or Viet Cong regiment. And

14:24.152 --> 14:39.272
very quickly, the American forces realized how 
they could and developed a system to capitalize on

14:24.152 --> 14:39.272
this intelligence by tying the reports in from the 
infrared with the artillery and bombing

14:39.674 --> 14:43.598
planners, and we made good use of this 
reconnaissance. But it didn't take long for the

14:43.618 --> 14:48.283
Viet Cong to realize that every time they lit a 
campfire, artillery would come in on them. And so

14:49.264 --> 14:52.627
they started using all sorts of techniques to 
avoid the infrared. For example, they would build

14:53.348 --> 15:00.335
a cover for a campfire that would diffuse the heat. 
And what it would do would make it so that it wasn't

15:00.355 --> 15:03.978
nearly as great a heat source. Or they would always 
build their campfires under deep jungle instead

15:03.998 --> 15:08.803
of building them where there was any chance the 
heat might radiate out through the jungle. And as a

15:13.827 --> 15:20.195
result of this, after a while, it became more and 
more difficult to find the enemy using infrared.

15:21.157 --> 15:24.561
Side-looking airborne radar was introduced in 
the country. It was originally designed to find

15:25.242 --> 15:30.189
tanks and armored personnel carriers and trucks. 
It had a limitation. in that it could find moving

15:33.708 --> 15:39.155
targets if they were going a minimum speed or had a 
minimum size. But invariably, we were looking at

15:40.036 --> 15:50.629
individual soldiers running down a trail, and 
they were neither large enough nor fast enough to

15:40.036 --> 15:50.629
show up on side-looking airborne radar. And so 
SLAR, as it was called, was used mainly along the

15:50.649 --> 16:02.263
borders looking into Cambodia and Laos and trying 
to find the Ho Chi Minh Trail and to try to peg where

16:02.665 --> 16:11.292
the big supply trucks were moving, who apparently 
moved in large numbers with relative freedom over

16:02.665 --> 16:11.292
there along the trail. And it was tough to find the 
Ho Chi Minh Trail without slar. As long as you

16:14.675 --> 16:18.278
didn't have real thick canopy, slar could 
penetrate. But about

16:19.179 --> 16:30.529
halfway through my tour, the Army and everyone 
started introducing what are called seismic

16:19.179 --> 16:30.529
intrusion devices. And these are gadgets. to feel 
the vibration of the earth as a soldier walks by or

16:32.045 --> 16:37.191
as a truck comes by. And it would radio that sensing 
back to a central location. And we had these

16:41.736 --> 16:48.343
seismic intrusion devices introduced into our 
area of operation in June or July of 1968. And it

16:49.664 --> 16:53.729
proved very, very effective because the 
Vietnamese didn't know they were there. They

16:54.650 --> 16:57.833
thought they were relatively free to run up and 
down the trail. And what it would do was tell us that

16:58.184 --> 17:04.071
there is movement on a trail segment between point 
so-and-so and point so-and-so. And it allowed us

17:04.652 --> 17:08.837
to establish a pattern of enemy movement. And it 
allowed us to determine where ambushes would be

17:09.498 --> 17:14.524
effective and where artillery fire would be 
effective.

17:19.190 --> 17:27.280
Did these technological devices replace the loss 
in human intelligence factors, did they at all

17:27.479 --> 17:33.847
compensate for the loss of human? I think they 
certainly made things a little bit better because

17:34.027 --> 17:42.097
without them it would have been a disaster. The 
human intelligence collection was so

17:42.137 --> 17:45.300
ineffective. At least it appeared to be from our 
point of view. But I can tell you that at the

17:49.185 --> 17:57.435
tactical level, at the infantry battalion level, 
they were very effective for us because they

17:49.185 --> 17:57.435
really determined where we were going to operate, 
and it was simple little things. They protected us

18:00.630 --> 18:02.212
in many cases. In June of 1968, they introduced 
these seismic intrusion devices to be used even by

18:03.192 --> 18:12.781
ambush patrols. What would amount to it, an ambush 
would set up, and they could put these devices one

18:12.921 --> 18:27.473
up and down the trail on either side, and one out to 
the front and one to the rear, and the platoon

18:12.921 --> 18:27.473
leader, the lieutenant, or the sergeant there 
could tell if the enemy was coming 15 minutes

18:27.773 --> 18:29.955
before the enemy got there. And that was providing 
him with warning that we never got before. And it

18:34.279 --> 18:44.629
caused the enemy to be ambushed very effectively 
in a lot of cases, and it protected our patrols from

18:34.279 --> 18:44.629
counter-ambush where the enemy might figure out 
that our guys were there. Our guys would know about

18:45.650 --> 18:48.133
it beforehand. Another technical device that I 
failed to mention that was introduced at this time

18:48.293 --> 18:54.439
and about this time was the night observation 
device. This is a device that enhances the

18:54.925 --> 19:02.434
existing light, no matter how dim it might be, so 
that you could see the enemy in almost pitch dark.

19:03.296 --> 19:07.941
And before the introduction of this device, the 
night belonged to the enemy. There was no doubt

19:07.981 --> 19:09.003
about it. Our guys could never develop the night 
vision that was needed. The Viet Cong would live in

19:12.607 --> 19:14.870
the dark. North Vietnamese live in the dark for a 
year, trying to infiltrate down. And so we could

19:19.356 --> 19:23.541
never win the night until the night observation 
device was introduced. And these involved They

19:24.642 --> 19:40.100
looked anything from a small scope that went on a 
rifle for sniper purposes up to a huge device about

19:24.642 --> 19:40.100
the size of a trombone or even larger that could be 
mounted on a tower and could collect light out two

19:24.642 --> 19:40.100
or three miles. And this virtually took the night 
away from the enemy and gave us the ability to see

19:40.660 --> 19:53.755
movement out around our defensive positions for a 
mile or two in any direction so long as the

19:40.660 --> 19:53.755
observation was clear The enemy could not 
surprise you with the night observation device.

19:58.448 --> 20:10.906
And there were many cases where snipers, when they 
were first introduced, snipers could use these

19:58.448 --> 20:10.906
night observation devices with a silencer on 
their rifle to pick off the enemy, and the enemy

19:58.448 --> 20:10.906
wouldn't even know what was hitting them. And the 
sniper would report the other enemy who were not

20:10.926 --> 20:17.675
shot with the first round would wonder what had 
happened. They were running around confused

20:18.236 --> 20:20.940
because it couldn't tell where the shot was coming 
from, and they couldn't imagine how anyone could

20:21.224 --> 20:27.570
see them to shoot them. Did the defoliation 
efforts of the ranch hands aid you in your effort as

20:27.590 --> 20:36.179
an aerial reconnaissance officer, or did it 
simply drive the enemy from the defoliated areas?

20:37.560 --> 20:49.932
I think it probably drove them from the defoliated 
area, but you've got to admit that that in itself

20:37.560 --> 20:49.932
aided us in our effort to find the enemy, because 
what it did was it took that part of the ground away

20:37.560 --> 20:49.932
from the enemy. There were only a few large areas in 
our area of operation that had been totally

20:50.350 --> 20:55.959
defoliated. By the time I was out in the field with 
the infantry battalion, much of the ground had

20:56.420 --> 21:05.014
already been plowed down with what were called 
Rome plows. This is where you would take huge

21:06.115 --> 21:12.726
caterpillar tractors with chains in between them 
and just plow the jungle into the ground. And that

21:13.407 --> 21:17.033
was massive defoliation of a non-chemical 
nature. We had some defoliation in our area, and I

21:17.553 --> 21:24.483
recall flying over some of the scouting, never 
finding any enemy in the area. And yet you could see

21:25.285 --> 21:37.483
evidence that before the defoliation, the area 
had been totally infiltrated with bunkers and

21:25.285 --> 21:37.483
trenches and foxholes. I remember flying over a 
zigzag trench that had been dug through the jungle

21:37.543 --> 21:46.817
for, oh, I would say two or three miles, just like in 
World War I. And I would guess that beforehand, and

21:47.371 --> 21:57.300
the trench was oriented so that troops could walk 
down the trench headed straight towards the large

21:47.371 --> 21:57.300
air base at Benoit. And the best I can imagine was 
before defoliation under the triple canopy

21:57.320 --> 22:04.808
jungle, you could move a company through that 
trench. And unless you put an artillery around

22:05.608 --> 22:09.412
right into the trench, they were safe the whole 
way. Well, now with defoliation, the trench was

22:10.033 --> 22:13.716
useless because we knew where it was. so my answer 
to that question is yes I think that it was

22:14.270 --> 22:44.175
effective and it helped us in our efforts to find 
the enemy but at the same time it did drive them to

22:14.270 --> 22:44.175
those areas that were not defoliated and it made us 
made it it helped us in that we knew where the enemy

22:14.270 --> 22:44.175
might be but it we just couldn't find them in the 
defoliated area once the area had been stripped

22:14.270 --> 22:44.175
away I think that before going further though I 
think I should say the Rome plow was much more

22:14.270 --> 22:44.175
important to us because the Rome plow opened up 
entire made the jungle into a prairie. So that at

22:47.243 --> 22:59.818
one point, for example, we had a tower built in our 
night defensive position, and I could see 10 miles

22:47.243 --> 22:59.818
in one direction with binoculars, and at night see 
5 miles with that night observation device. And no

22:59.838 --> 23:06.887
one could literally, no one could move through 
there in large numbers without us catching them

22:59.838 --> 23:06.887
because of the roll cloud. Were you aware of the 
Phoenix program while you were stationed in

23:08.669 --> 23:12.373
Vietnam? I was aware of the Phoenix program. I 
didn't have a lot of contact with it. And the way I

23:16.284 --> 23:27.996
was aware of it was that at one point I trained a lot 
of people who were on the Phoenix program as to how

23:16.284 --> 23:27.996
to use aerial reconnaissance, reconnaissance 
products, what reconnaissance could do for them.

23:29.037 --> 23:31.239
My dealings were not very extensive with them. 
They were not located in an area. They did not

23:35.964 --> 23:40.369
operate in the areas that I was located in when I was 
with the infantry. And as a result, I didn't have

23:40.855 --> 23:44.801
any operational dealings with them per se. I 
remember one time bumping into one of the CIA guys

23:44.841 --> 23:49.187
that worked in that business. He had some national 
police that came out with us and helped us on a sweep

23:50.069 --> 23:54.275
of the village. But for the most part, I had very 
little dealings with them because they weren't

23:54.295 --> 24:01.125
operating in our area of operations. Did you 
coordinate your intelligence efforts with other

24:01.145 --> 24:04.450
similar networks? I would coordinate very 
closely with the local advisors and with the

24:05.358 --> 24:14.749
local, if there was an ARVIN unit in our area, I 
would on occasion go over and visit them. But our

24:15.189 --> 24:22.418
situation was somewhat unique in that we were 
working in an area that had been declared a

24:15.189 --> 24:22.418
free-fire zone. And what that meant was that all of 
the local civilians, for the most part, had been

24:22.999 --> 24:32.850
relocated out of the area so that we could assume 
that anybody in the area was in it. And that was the

24:33.522 --> 24:34.864
basic rule. If you were out there, you were a 
target. And for that reason, we didn't have too

24:37.567 --> 24:41.833
many other agencies to coordinate with. It was our 
area of operation, just very much like an isolated

24:41.873 --> 24:46.159
little war of its own.

24:49.303 --> 25:01.960
Did you feel that the lack of coordination with 
ARVIN or not using ARVIN as interpreters kind of

24:49.303 --> 25:01.960
was a liability to your intelligence gathering? I 
think it could have hurt us. It would have helped us

25:05.123 --> 25:13.499
if we could have, for example, had an infantry 
company of all ARVN with us in the infantry

25:05.123 --> 25:13.499
battalion that we were in. But that didn't happen. 
We did have ARVN soldiers to serve as our

25:15.542 --> 25:21.674
interpreters within the infantry battalion. I 
had three interpreters that were assigned to me

25:21.694 --> 25:26.142
all the time. and they were designed to help us 
interrogate prisoners on the spot. You see, when

25:29.792 --> 25:36.241
you capture a prisoner, the most effective 
interrogation happens right after the capture.

25:36.261 --> 25:47.355
When the soldier, when the enemy is scared, he 
doesn't know what's going to happen, he's still

25:36.261 --> 25:47.355
frightened from the battle and disoriented, and 
he hasn't had a chance to talk to any of his leaders

25:36.261 --> 25:47.355
that are also captured. And also, you can get 
information from him at that time that can help you

25:47.375 --> 25:53.142
in the immediate fight that you're still in. And so 
I had three ARVN interpreters that were with me

25:53.611 --> 25:59.076
that spoke pretty good English. And they were with 
us full time. And I would send them out with the

26:01.778 --> 26:08.184
rifle companies in case a capture took place. And 
their job was to find out what was going on. And they

26:10.866 --> 26:13.989
would answer to the immediate company commander 
that was there. They were somewhat of a problem

26:14.629 --> 26:22.096
because they tended to try to avoid combat. They 
didn't want to get shot at. And there were even

26:23.986 --> 26:35.543
times when at least one of them I suspected as being 
a BC sympathizer because he tended to disappear

26:23.986 --> 26:35.543
right before the big fights. He would always have 
to go back to base camp to check on his finance or his

26:36.625 --> 26:45.298
pay or something just before we got our 9th 
defensive position attack and that sort of thing.

26:45.859 --> 26:51.968
I never was able to pin anything on him, but he was a 
relatively unreliable sort of character that...

26:52.285 --> 26:53.887
became a liability. One of them was very good, and I 
could use him to get out there when we captured

26:53.907 --> 27:02.961
somebody and get immediate information that the 
company commander or the battalion commander

26:53.907 --> 27:02.961
could use. But I think ideally

27:03.642 --> 27:19.124
we should have had perhaps ARVN soldiers with us, 
particularly if we were operating in an area where

27:03.642 --> 27:19.124
there were civilian population also alongside 
us. But In our area of operation, as I said, there

27:20.483 --> 27:23.466
weren't very many civilians. And as a result, I'm 
not so sure that we would have used that

27:23.506 --> 27:29.552
capability. What we might could have used is 
someone who knew the area better, the terrain,

27:29.613 --> 27:36.320
knew where the creek bottoms were, knew where the 
trails were. And that's what we really lacked. We

27:39.343 --> 27:42.045
didn't know the ground very well. And it's just a 
complex terrain that could be very confusing. And

27:47.211 --> 27:48.632
the enemy knew it better than us. And as a result, 
we're able to use it better. What type of warfare

27:52.563 --> 27:58.909
would you classify the conflict that you were 
participating in? Well, at the time that I was the

28:00.050 --> 28:21.709
S2 of 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry, our battle, 
our tactic had to be one that was almost

28:00.050 --> 28:21.709
conventional warfare, in that we were located 
northeast of Saigon, about 40, 50 miles out, and

28:00.050 --> 28:21.709
our job was to deny the enemy infiltration into the 
capital area so that they could not mass for the

28:22.043 --> 28:28.989
follow-up offensive to the Tet Offensive of 1968. 
Generally, I think the authorities, the people in

28:29.429 --> 28:43.101
country that did this sort of thing thought that 
the enemy would mount another offensive in May.

28:43.141 --> 28:48.386
They tried to mount a small offensive, but they 
really weren't capable, and they thought another

28:43.141 --> 28:48.386
Tet was coming maybe in the fall. And so our mission 
was to get out and deny infiltration. And it turned

28:53.306 --> 28:59.712
out that really we were ambushing in company size 
almost, not little small ambushes. And we were

29:00.754 --> 29:10.704
trying to find the enemy out at the 40 mile range out 
there so that we could engage them before they

29:00.754 --> 29:10.704
could assemble and move south. We were working 
against organized units, conventional units,

29:10.724 --> 29:15.889
not small change outfits. There were times when 
our ambushes would pop on on 50-man units moving

29:18.912 --> 29:26.559
through the jungle, certainly not classical 
guerrilla-type warfare. The units that we fought

29:27.440 --> 29:41.572
against were armed with machine guns, mortars, 
anti-tank rocket launchers, and therefore

29:27.440 --> 29:41.572
couldn't be considered to be guerrilla-type 
organizations. They had sergeants and captains

29:41.632 --> 29:45.196
and colonels in charge. They had communications. 
They were mainline North Vietnamese units or they

29:49.169 --> 29:55.498
were Viet Cong units that were trained along the 
same organization line. After serving in

29:57.301 --> 30:01.167
Vietnam, you attended several professional 
military schools. How was the topic of Vietnam

30:01.968 --> 30:04.031
treated? Well, in fact, after Vietnam, I returned 
to Fort Holabird and for one year attended what's

30:05.714 --> 30:16.830
called the Intelligence Officers Advance 
Course.

30:17.435 --> 30:29.231
The course was one of those experiences that you 
have now and then where it's just beyond reality

30:17.435 --> 30:29.231
how inapplicable that course was for our 
development. It was sort of a hodgepodge, an

30:29.251 --> 30:39.244
effort to try to prepare officers to go to Vietnam, 
in case anyone hadn't, although all of us had

30:29.251 --> 30:39.244
already been to Vietnam once. And yet it was an 
effort to continue to try to watch for the Soviets

30:39.965 --> 30:46.834
in the European theater. and how to be an 
intelligence officer against them. Very, very

30:50.111 --> 30:59.000
few of the experiences in Vietnam were taught in 
this officer's advance course. They hadn't been

30:59.020 --> 31:02.484
condensed, consolidated. They had not been put 
into doctrine yet. And I don't think anybody was. I

31:05.887 --> 31:11.493
think we were fighting a war at the time, and 
therefore didn't have time to sit back and think

31:05.887 --> 31:11.493
about how to do it better. That's unfortunate. We 
probably should have.

31:16.953 --> 31:22.739
Eight years later, I went to the Command and 
General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth,

31:16.953 --> 31:22.739
Kansas. And there, after that period of time, you 
would have thought that someone would have sat

31:23.700 --> 31:30.086
down and thought this out. Vietnam had fallen by 
then. This was 1976. And I think that I would have

31:36.392 --> 31:46.302
thought that people would have had plenty of 
opportunity to review the subject and to come up

31:36.392 --> 31:46.302
with at least some lessons learned that could be 
taught, if not an entire new concept or doctrine

31:46.602 --> 31:52.849
for this sort of warfare. But instead, what I found 
was that the Army had turned to the east, to the

31:53.409 --> 32:16.373
European theater, to conventional war against 
the Soviets, and was concentrating its efforts on

31:53.409 --> 32:16.373
learning the Soviet warfare techniques and 
equipment and organization better, and totally

31:53.409 --> 32:16.373
ignored counter-revolutionary warfare, 
counter-guerrilla warfare, low-intensity

32:16.842 --> 32:24.772
warfare, whatever you might want to call it. There 
were a couple of electives offered in the subject.

32:28.377 --> 32:31.301
I'm told that they offered very little in new 
ideas. We rarely talked about Vietnam unless

32:32.883 --> 32:43.997
someone was telling war stories, and everything 
that we were doing and everything that we learned

32:32.883 --> 32:43.997
was oriented towards the towards the European 
environment and totally ignored the Vietnamese

32:44.365 --> 32:50.754
experience. That contrasted, however, to the 
British Army Staff College. In 1980, I attended

32:55.741 --> 33:01.950
the British Army Staff College and was one of three 
Americans there. I found that the Brits

33:03.992 --> 33:10.281
concentrated on this sort of warfare. They called 
it counter-revolutionary warfare for almost

33:14.032 --> 33:18.698
one-third of the year-long course. It's a little 
wonder because the Brits are still involved in

33:19.739 --> 33:39.644
this sort of situation or conflict in Northern 
Ireland and they're spending a lot of effort to it

33:19.739 --> 33:39.644
and perhaps they're doing it right because their 
tactics are a little bit more clearly resolved

33:19.739 --> 33:39.644
than ours. They use low-level They seem to use 
intelligence better. They don't rely so heavily

33:44.537 --> 33:52.887
on technology as we do, although the technology 
has got its part with the British effort. But in

33:52.907 --> 34:02.418
general, it was just somewhat surprising to see 
that they spend more effort and more time teaching

33:52.907 --> 34:02.418
their officers how to do this sort of warfare than 
we do. Perhaps we'll get back to that someday. But

34:05.762 --> 34:08.085
we haven't done it yet that I know of. and 
repeatedly I've asked general officers in our

34:08.470 --> 34:27.940
army when that's going to happen and it doesn't 
seem as though it's come back into vogue yet and

34:08.470 --> 34:27.940
won't be until perhaps we have another 
environment, another threat to us in that sort of

34:08.470 --> 34:27.940
situation that we're required. Do you think that 
the military intelligence community is prepared

34:27.980 --> 34:37.414
for a similar situation, let's say, in Central 
America? Are they prepared to assess the level of

34:41.539 --> 34:50.190
conflict and predict the enemy's troop 
movements, et cetera? I think we're better off

34:50.710 --> 34:52.152
now. And that sort of contradicts what I said 
before. But I'll tell you why. And it's a

34:56.838 --> 35:03.045
simplistic response, maybe, but I think it has 
some weight of truth. And that is that the Central

35:03.486 --> 35:06.810
American environment We're more familiar with 
it. We have more people that speak that language.

35:11.884 --> 35:14.787
We know better how the people there think. We have a 
better assessment of their techniques. We know

35:20.694 --> 35:23.137
the environment there. We know the terrain. We 
know the national conditions that exist,

35:24.519 --> 35:34.251
although we don't handle it very smart, at least at 
the strategic level, perhaps. I think we're

35:34.271 --> 35:36.814
better prepared for... a similar situation in 
Central America. And I think we would do much

35:41.275 --> 35:42.556
better. The Oriental mystique, the failure of 
Americans to even understand how an Oriental

35:42.596 --> 35:56.111
thinks was perhaps our fundamental cause of our 
downfall in Vietnam. And we just didn't know how to

35:57.793 --> 36:01.998
think in their terms. I think we know how to think 
perhaps a little bit better in a Latin American

36:02.639 --> 36:06.683
term. I think we've had more contact with them. We 
have, for example, the Army has about 10% of its

36:10.116 --> 36:18.625
people who speak Spanish as their first language. 
And that reason alone will help us. That fact alone

36:20.707 --> 36:24.251
helps us a lot. The fact that we've had a greater 
presence in Latin America over history and a

36:24.271 --> 36:33.641
greater knowledge of what goes on down there will 
help us a lot, I believe. But at the same time, If we

36:34.895 --> 36:57.900
make the same mistakes in Latin America that we 
made in Vietnam concerning our assessment of the

36:34.895 --> 36:57.900
so-called enemies, will our assessment of the 
enemy's determination or their capability to

36:34.895 --> 36:57.900
conduct extended protracted warfare, if we make 
those same mistakes and we go about it in the wrong

36:34.895 --> 36:57.900
way as we did in Vietnam, we're not going to come out 
any better. We've got to look at the strategic

36:58.681 --> 37:02.505
situation carefully before we make any 
commitments there. And that strategic situation

37:06.188 --> 37:12.006
and decision will then determine how we do things 
at the grassroots level.
