WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:05.088
...cost for those displaced as a result of urban 
renewal. Could you continue with that, please?

00:07.552 --> 00:18.647
Under the university eminent domain 
proceedings, apparently there would not have

00:07.552 --> 00:18.647
been a relocation

00:07.552 --> 00:18.647
cost that would enter into it. And by going the 
urban renewal route, this meant that the people

00:19.088 --> 00:24.896
would get payment for a relocation. And that was 
one of the reasons that urban renewal was used. Can

00:31.098 --> 00:44.605
you see areas of the city that were impacted by this 
as a result of influx of those that were displaced

00:31.098 --> 00:44.605
and let's say a demand on services that had not been 
anticipated as a result of urban renewal programs

00:31.098 --> 00:44.605
and had to be planned for? I don't recall a specific 
area that was impacted as a result. We did have

00:54.404 --> 01:06.336
individuals who were displaced, and I think it was 
very difficult for some of them to find comparable

00:54.404 --> 01:06.336
property that they could afford. Now, some of the 
areas in the university area, we had a number of

01:07.236 --> 01:14.563
elderly widows. I don't know why, but this tends to 
happen that way, who had converted their

01:18.685 --> 01:27.154
residences to boarding houses and apartments, 
and it was their primary livelihood. Now, a number

01:27.855 --> 01:35.663
of them did not go into or continue that occupation 
as they were displaced. In other words, other

01:35.683 --> 01:41.249
arrangements were made, and that was 
discontinued. So I do think that we affected

01:42.571 --> 01:48.237
individuals, but I don't think that the 
population was that so great that we had a mass

01:48.470 --> 02:00.504
exodus or group that impacted any other section of 
town to any extensive degree. Which sections of

02:01.745 --> 02:10.275
Austin would you say people would mainly relocate 
in as a result of their limited incomes? Well, in

02:10.643 --> 02:17.993
the university area, I would say that a number of 
the people would go into apartments. Some of them,

02:18.254 --> 02:20.717
I'm sure, went to live with families.

02:23.581 --> 02:29.049
I do know of some who just moved to, say, duplexes 
and this sort of thing. The community development

02:30.671 --> 02:40.465
program of the federal government, mid-1970s to 
present, how has this affected planning in

02:30.671 --> 02:40.465
Austin?

02:46.300 --> 02:51.986
I don't think that I can answer that question 
adequately today. The freeway era, especially

02:52.006 --> 03:05.260
the interstate highway system of mid-1950s and 
that had major impact in cities in changing

02:52.006 --> 03:05.260
transportation routes, in many cities 
increasing suburbanization and that. What

03:05.620 --> 03:10.685
planning was involved to deal with the fallout 
from this type of program in Austin? Well,

03:12.367 --> 03:16.071
actually, we had tremendous advantage when 
Interstate 35 was put in. We had East Avenue in that

03:19.944 --> 03:26.781
general location, and it initially was about 200 
feet wide. And so the initial construction on

03:27.703 --> 03:33.317
Interstate was within that right of way. The later 
construction, it was, as you know, that these

03:33.820 --> 03:46.577
projects are almost out of date by the time that you 
start implementing them because of population

03:33.820 --> 03:46.577
growth and so on. So the northern section was built 
with 200 feet of right-of-way. Then the

03:50.963 --> 04:00.095
midsection, which was through the Bracken Ridge 
area and on south, it was discovered that really

03:50.963 --> 04:00.095
they needed more right-of-way, so more 
right-of-way was acquired. But because of having

04:00.436 --> 04:03.760
200 to begin with, it wasn't, you know, as bad as it 
might have been. Then as the traffic need

04:07.277 --> 04:14.947
increased, it was discovered that we could not 
stay within that 200 feet. We needed extra area for

04:16.028 --> 04:19.733
extra lanes. And at that time, the Highway 
Department looked at the land cost versus

04:20.274 --> 04:29.646
construction cost, and it was determined that 
they would go with a double deck. because the land

04:30.655 --> 04:35.241
costs apparently were higher than the 
construction costs. So that's what resulted in

04:35.261 --> 04:39.466
the double-deck of interstate. Now, of course, we 
do have continued expansion north end and south

04:40.328 --> 04:51.482
end on interstate and where the right-of-way can 
be acquired for apparently less than the

04:51.766 --> 04:53.949
double-decking. We're going with the surface, 
more or less. As far as the urban area extending on

04:58.757 --> 05:16.525
out as a result, or you might call it suburban, as a 
result of the expressways, we've had really only

04:58.757 --> 05:16.525
one expressway, and that's Interstate 35. We have 
a number of other major arterioles, but most of

05:17.011 --> 05:25.842
those are really overburdened, and they need to be 
expressed ways. 183 is virtually a nightmare

05:25.862 --> 05:33.292
because of all the development that we've had that 
has gone on out. And Austin, contrary to some of the

05:33.912 --> 05:44.706
things that you will find in the new comprehensive 
plan where people state that they want to

05:33.912 --> 05:44.706
establish

05:47.335 --> 05:54.926
land development that would support a mass 
transit system or bus system, whatever, anyway, a

05:47.335 --> 05:54.926
type of mass transit.

05:58.251 --> 06:09.647
Each time anybody comes in with a proposal for any 
sort of high density, be it apartments, high rise,

05:58.251 --> 06:09.647
anything of that sort, we have tremendous 
opposition. from the abutting neighborhoods.

06:14.283 --> 06:17.688
They do not want high density residential. They 
feel as though that they want single family. And

06:21.534 --> 06:24.799
even in areas, they don't want duplexes even. They 
object to townhouses. In other words, single

06:27.003 --> 06:30.949
family is what everybody seems to want. And 
everybody can't afford it. But the people who are

06:33.112 --> 06:39.482
already there, they say, we want to keep this the 
way it is. And the people who are coming in, they

06:39.648 --> 06:42.452
need housing. And we have a difficult situation. 
And I'm not sure whether we have any good solution

06:48.101 --> 06:56.273
for it, because there are times when you want mass 
transit. You need higher intensity development

06:56.593 --> 07:01.200
in order to support mass transit. The further out 
you go, the more you have the need for the mass

07:02.142 --> 07:08.716
transit, but if you have such low density, mass 
transit can't support itself. So we have a

07:09.498 --> 07:15.831
situation that I don't think has a good answer. How 
did the location of Interstate 35 itself, its

07:16.840 --> 07:28.779
position in the city, affect developmental 
patterns as far as residences and businesses

07:16.840 --> 07:28.779
went? Was there any kind of partitioning by income 
groups, ethnic groups, or anything like that that

07:28.819 --> 07:35.770
you can see as a result of Interstate 35? I don't 
think it was as a result of Interstate 35. I feel as

07:39.255 --> 07:43.101
though that we had the...

07:45.292 --> 07:48.755
pattern already set before interstate ever came 
in. East Austin has been predominantly minority

07:49.776 --> 07:59.586
and West Austin and some minority in South Austin, 
but it has generally been on the east side. And I

08:00.206 --> 08:13.459
think part of the reason for this is that as the 
transportation system changed from railroad to

08:00.206 --> 08:13.459
other forms of transportation, the affluent 
moved away from the East Austin area And this

08:13.709 --> 08:15.792
housing then became available. It was a little 
lower priced. And so I think the minorities tended

08:19.497 --> 08:25.245
to move into that area. And it just developed this 
way. A filtering process, you'd say. Yes.

08:31.975 --> 08:40.006
What significant public development projects or 
private development projects can you think of

08:31.975 --> 08:40.006
have impacted planning in Austin? University of 
Texas is a major industry. That has impacted

08:44.438 --> 08:49.045
Austin tremendously in more ways than one. The 
street system, because of the fact that they have

08:51.609 --> 09:00.983
continued to expand, we continue to vacate 
streets. In other words, they form kind of a big

09:01.303 --> 09:06.531
barrier or block. in right north of the core area. 
The taxing situation, it has affected that

09:11.306 --> 09:24.164
because we have over 50% of the land within the city 
of Austin is tax-exempt because it's either

09:11.306 --> 09:24.164
university, state, church, federal, county. And 
so this does affect Austin quite a bit. And its tax

09:29.712 --> 09:30.553
base. And its tax base. The other things... We 
have, of course, Bergstrom, which has impacted to

09:36.211 --> 09:44.159
a degree. You don't stop and think about some of 
these impacts as much when they've been here a long

09:45.641 --> 09:56.492
time, because you have learned to integrate it 
into the community, and you just don't really

09:45.641 --> 09:56.492
think about the impact. Then, of course, we've had 
industries that have come in. But until just

10:00.536 --> 10:05.982
fairly recent years, we didn't have any major 
industries here. We had the university, I think,

10:05.962 --> 10:15.911
and the state capital were the two major 
industries in Austin as far as employment was

10:05.962 --> 10:15.911
concerned. That's another reason, of course, our 
economy has been as stable as it has been because we

10:17.972 --> 10:28.982
have not been dependent on the market as such as far 
as goods are concerned. And that is changing

10:29.863 --> 10:35.968
because we've had more industry here, but we have 
what we would consider the higher quality

10:35.948 --> 10:44.278
industries, the clean industries, and this is 
what has been encouraged for Austin. And, of

10:44.298 --> 10:47.081
course, one of the reasons for that is the 
university. So we go back to the influence of the

10:47.422 --> 11:04.943
university because a lot of the technological 
industries like to move here because they have a

10:47.422 --> 11:04.943
source of drawing from employees from the 
university, which, of course, has benefited us.

11:06.712 --> 11:12.361
What is the positioning of these so-called clean 
industries in Austin? Are they fairly,

11:12.862 --> 11:20.594
do they remain clustered in a particular area of 
town? Can you characterize it in that sense? I

11:23.479 --> 11:25.682
don't think we can do it. Quite in that way, we do 
have several industries out northwest. They

11:32.024 --> 11:33.085
wanted acreages. Most of the industries that have 
come in have not wanted to move into the areas that

11:34.687 --> 11:46.865
we had laid out basically for industry in the 
original 1961 plan. Can you see reasons for that?

11:49.269 --> 11:49.389
Yes. It's because as soon as people felt as though 
their land was classified for industry, they

11:50.110 --> 11:56.479
boosted the price. And they felt, here we have an 
industrial price. So when the industries came in,

12:00.748 --> 12:08.156
they started looking for other land that was not 
classified for industry, and they could get it for

12:00.748 --> 12:08.156
a lot less. And that's exactly what happened. And 
you found that the industries, of course, would

12:10.759 --> 12:16.605
move wherever they found land was the least 
expensive. Transportation was not as important a

12:16.745 --> 12:18.907
factor. Well, all of them have considered 
transportation, too. All of them have not

12:23.712 --> 12:36.989
considered terrain because one of the things that 
in the 1961 plan, the industries that we had

12:23.712 --> 12:36.989
established and some of them have followed 
through in these areas very well. We had located

12:37.530 --> 12:45.720
them where our terrain was fairly level, where we 
had rail service, where we had major streets.

12:45.869 --> 12:51.038
Those areas, a lot of them are developing for 
industry, like we had anticipated. But we have had

12:51.478 --> 12:56.166
a good bit of pressure on for industry in other 
areas as well. How have state projects, new

12:57.148 --> 13:09.548
construction, new state office buildings in the 
capital area impacted planning in the city of

12:57.148 --> 13:09.548
Austin by taking available land space, other than 
the taxing problem?

13:11.502 --> 13:20.852
Of course, in the 61 plan, we had anticipated that 
the capital would expand all the way from 11th

13:11.502 --> 13:20.852
Street to 19th Street. And we had worked with the 
state at that time, and they did make plans on what

13:21.793 --> 13:32.285
their expansion would be. One of the things that I 
think has affected the community, and that is that

13:41.202 --> 13:49.154
We do not have control over zoning control over 
state buildings. And so heist limitations, that

13:50.156 --> 13:54.983
sort of thing, they can do as they please. And we do, 
or we have ended up with some buildings that have a

13:56.285 --> 14:04.358
certain tendency to block the capital view. to a 
degree, but of course we have private buildings

14:04.861 --> 14:12.048
under the zoning jurisdiction that also do the 
same. Have height restrictions been considered

14:13.169 --> 14:19.415
in the area in order that the capital view may be 
preserved? Oh yes, that is I think going to be one of

14:19.435 --> 14:24.660
the upcoming major issues. We have had a number of 
high-rise proposals within the past year, and

14:34.055 --> 14:48.888
There's been more and more concern expressed by 
various groups and citizens in regard to keeping

14:34.055 --> 14:48.888
the visibility of the capital protected. It's a 
very difficult situation because Austin is

14:50.290 --> 14:53.232
hilly. There are some areas that maybe you could 
have a fairly tall high rise that would not affect.

15:02.573 --> 15:05.276
the line of vision from major parts of the city. 
Then there are other areas that if you have

15:06.056 --> 15:18.969
prominent locations, or as far as height would be 
concerned, the relationship, even a fairly

15:06.056 --> 15:18.969
low-rise building could block. So we are working 
on this to a degree at the present time. It's going

15:24.774 --> 15:31.821
to take some time to

15:24.774 --> 15:31.821
develop the visual corridor plan. But again, that 
is something that will be coming up. Has the land

15:40.728 --> 16:00.234
that's been taken up by the state government as a 
result of capital expansion and university

15:40.728 --> 16:00.234
expansion resulted in a squeeze in land space that 
is needed for commercial facilities and

15:40.728 --> 16:00.234
residential facilities for the employees and the 
influx of population that's resulted? I don't

16:00.714 --> 16:03.839
think that it really has affected it in that way. 
The downtown area, there's a lot of available land

16:10.495 --> 16:12.037
I should not say land. There are a number of older 
buildings that are not being used to capacity. We

16:21.628 --> 16:29.317
have a number of areas that need to be revitalized 
that are not being used to their full optimum. I

16:31.079 --> 16:38.528
don't believe that the university and state 
expansion has really affected the commercial

16:31.079 --> 16:38.528
development. Now, you mentioned earlier that 
it's only been in recent years that a number of

16:38.862 --> 16:49.733
industries have been attracted to the area, and 
most of them have been so-called light

16:38.862 --> 16:49.733
industries. Have heavy industries ever played a 
role in planning in Austin, or do you think they

16:50.454 --> 16:55.499
might in the future?

16:58.682 --> 17:05.389
We had one, and that was when Michelin, the entire 
company, planned to come in with a plant. This was

17:06.470 --> 17:07.992
when, pardon? about a year and a half to two years 
ago. Not very long ago.

17:16.681 --> 17:17.822
They had selected a site. Accessibility

17:19.203 --> 17:23.527
was a little bit of a problem. However, the 
development of the industry would not have

17:24.488 --> 17:31.014
generated much more traffic than residential 
development of the same site. But there was a fear

17:32.735 --> 17:36.038
on the part of most of the surrounding 
subdivisions, existing subdivisions, that it

17:36.524 --> 17:45.513
would create tremendous environmental 
problems. Whenever you think about a tire

17:46.634 --> 17:54.322
company, you think about the worst part of the tire 
company, the odors and everything. The Michelin

17:55.323 --> 18:02.970
company was very, very secretive in their 
proposal in the early stages. They did not come in

18:03.431 --> 18:05.653
and do any groundwork as far as preparing 
neighborhoods or meeting with neighborhoods.

18:10.863 --> 18:20.155
They got information as far as availability of 
utilities and, you know, a number of things,

18:10.863 --> 18:20.155
technical questions had been asked. And we had 
reviewed it in that sense without knowing what

18:20.896 --> 18:25.642
sort of industry was being proposed. So when they 
made the announcement, there was an immediate

18:27.585 --> 18:33.953
negative response. attitude and feeling on the 
part of the public. And even though they did fly a

18:39.893 --> 18:58.759
number of people, including I think some of the 
neighborhood leaders, to some of the plants that

18:39.893 --> 18:58.759
functioned in a comparable way, and the feeling 
was still so negative that they just dropped the

18:39.893 --> 18:58.759
project. How have other major commercial 
investments played a part in planning in Austin?

19:06.323 --> 19:13.369
Major commercial or let's say residential 
subdivisions or developments like that, how have

19:06.323 --> 19:13.369
they played a part in planning in Austin?

19:17.773 --> 19:20.475
I'm not exactly sure how to answer that. We have 
some developers who are very, very large and they

19:21.496 --> 19:29.083
develop Certain areas, they have a tendency to go 
into areas that can be served easily, that are

19:29.485 --> 19:38.797
lower in cost so that the housing ends up being 
lower. They can develop for a lower price. And

19:42.482 --> 19:54.318
one thing that we've had a problem on, and that is 
that the new comprehensive plan established a

19:42.482 --> 19:54.318
north-south growth corridor. In some of those 
areas, the utilities are not there. The concept

19:59.354 --> 20:11.607
was that the city would encourage the development 
in these areas by participating by means of CIP in

19:59.354 --> 20:11.607
bringing services to the area and so on. The other 
areas, the growth areas that were supposed to be

20:13.950 --> 20:28.686
protected and discouraged, we were not to deny the 
development of those areas, but we were not to

20:13.950 --> 20:28.686
participate and provide any funding for these 
other areas. Unfortunately,

20:34.213 --> 20:53.797
some of the areas that are in the more sensitive 
environmentally

20:34.213 --> 20:53.797
situated locations are the ones that are very 
desirable for housing. They have the views. In

20:57.201 --> 20:58.723
other words, Some of them are in the more affluent 
areas. It costs more to develop, but that's where a

21:02.079 --> 21:06.607
lot of people want to live. And those are the most 
environmentally sensitive at the same time.

21:08.450 --> 21:11.255
That's right, and that's where the people would 
like to live. And so we have pressures on because

21:11.375 --> 21:22.635
the developers are responding to the market, and 
the market is there, and so they want to develop

21:11.375 --> 21:22.635
those areas. Can you think of specific 
development projects that were large enough in

21:23.746 --> 21:37.627
scale that, in and of themselves, they had a 
significant impact on planning as a result of

21:23.746 --> 21:37.627
transportation, utility needs, or expansion? 
Are you talking about housing or industry or both?

21:42.955 --> 21:47.021
Well, both, I would imagine, especially 
residential, let's say. Residential? Well,

21:47.642 --> 21:53.010
we've had some, well, just like in that 183 
corridor. We've had a series of subdivisions that

21:53.716 --> 21:58.326
have moved into that area. And part of it is a result 
of Texas Instruments going in and IBM in the

21:58.467 --> 22:05.543
Northwest sector. And so housing wants to be a 
little bit closer to places of employment. So they

22:12.278 --> 22:20.410
kind of go together a little bit, and so we've had a 
lot of pressure on that area, and of course it

22:12.278 --> 22:20.410
affects the street system. Well, I'm not going to 
say it's overloaded, but it's over text, and with

22:20.871 --> 22:33.009
the speeds that people travel, whether they're 
within the speed limit or not, we've ended up with a

22:20.871 --> 22:33.009
fairly dangerous situation. We have a number of 
subdivisions that have gone into various areas

22:36.325 --> 23:04.510
where the streets are not really up to standard 
that might create problems as the subdivision

22:36.325 --> 23:04.510
developed because with the capital improvement 
program needs for some of these streets, just like

22:36.325 --> 23:04.510
our last bond election didn't make it, so we did not 
have the funding for upgrading of some of the

22:36.325 --> 23:04.510
facilities that needed to be upgraded. So we are 
ending up with some developments that are on

23:04.490 --> 23:10.258
streets that are not really adequate. And not 
designed for that kind of capacity. I mean, the

23:13.403 --> 23:32.269
plans were there in relation to the arterial 
system, but the timing had not been reached

23:13.403 --> 23:32.269
because of either the capital improvements 
program or the bond election not making it or the

23:13.403 --> 23:32.269
fact that there is always a time lag

23:34.730 --> 23:40.757
What significant changes in the city charter have 
impacted the administration of planning in

23:34.730 --> 23:40.757
Austin? There haven't been any major changes that 
would have impacted us, in my opinion. Are there

23:47.566 --> 23:52.251
any charter changes that would have 
significantly impacted plan implementation?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.235
Different types of zoning allowed? Well, not, I 
don't think, within the charter. Now, I think, I'm

23:59.720 --> 24:02.644
trying to remember what proposals came up there 
have been some discussions on modifying the

24:04.025 --> 24:19.502
charter and I think that with if we end up having 
area planning And if that should go through sector

24:19.617 --> 24:33.112
planning, that would impact our department 
tremendously, because we would not have the staff

24:19.617 --> 24:33.112
to function in this way. Could you briefly 
describe on what basis these sectors would be

24:33.533 --> 24:40.541
delineated in that? Well, this is the other 
problem on exactly what boundaries would be

24:40.561 --> 24:45.286
established. But I'm assuming that it would be 
established based on physical barriers. And

24:51.636 --> 25:04.115
I don't think that we have the definition, say, for 
neighborhood, even though a lot of people call

24:51.636 --> 25:04.115
themselves a neighborhood group. We don't have 
the traditional definition of a neighborhood

25:04.616 --> 25:13.049
anymore. What is a neighborhood? I can't answer 
you anymore. We used to use long ago, really the

25:19.270 --> 25:24.718
service area of, say, an elementary school. But 
with all our cross busing, that's gone out the

25:25.839 --> 25:28.583
window. We do have some areas that are physically

25:30.165 --> 25:44.025
separated by creeks, by major thoroughfares, by a 
major public holding of land. There are various

25:44.826 --> 25:48.872
things like that that might establish an area or a 
neighborhood But when we talk about either sector

25:49.578 --> 26:02.102
planning or neighborhood planning,

25:49.578 --> 26:02.102
I think that our definition is a little bit loose. 
And the areas would have to be set up. It could be set

26:05.122 --> 26:10.389
up, say, almost in quadrants for the city, in four 
quadrants. But on what line we would use, whether

26:10.870 --> 26:24.329
we would use, say, Lake Austin and Town Lake as one 
of the major boundaries, I'm sure that we would

26:10.870 --> 26:24.329
because I think it would be a logical one. 
Interstate 35 would be another fairly good

26:24.770 --> 26:29.777
barrier because... We do not have as much

26:29.977 --> 26:49.876
neighborhood association

26:29.977 --> 26:49.876
across those major barriers. What 
administrative changes within the planning

26:51.598 --> 26:56.743
department can you see since you've been working 
here? have impacted planning for Austin in its

26:57.213 --> 27:00.117
history?

27:03.983 --> 27:09.692
Well, of course, the planning department was once 
a part of Public Works. It separated off. Do you

27:12.817 --> 27:15.341
know about when it was that it separated off? I 
think that it was in the late 40s, or 48, 50, right in

27:15.501 --> 27:26.157
through there.

27:28.482 --> 27:39.315
The fact that our Planning Commission makeup has 
changed the way that we function has changed a

27:28.482 --> 27:39.315
little. We have realigned as the needs came up 
within the department because we

27:41.437 --> 27:55.013
have changed from just one department and 
developed into sections. The sections have

27:59.853 --> 28:08.906
changed because we used to have an engineering 
section that was dropped out and actually the

27:59.853 --> 28:08.906
engineering section covered the drafting and the 
drafting ended up under current planning. So we

28:09.627 --> 28:17.358
have realigned depending on the needs of the 
community. How have changes in directorship of

28:19.061 --> 28:25.911
the planning department itself over the years 
changed the personality or changed the

28:28.287 --> 28:31.993
operations of the planning department? I don't 
think there has been too great a change. We've had,

28:37.742 --> 28:53.046
I think, very dedicated directors who are 
dedicated to the community, to the keeping the

28:37.742 --> 28:53.046
community environmentally

28:56.890 --> 28:57.712
Well, clean. We have concern for existing 
neighborhoods, residences. This is one thing

29:04.664 --> 29:10.495
that has been consistent throughout.

29:12.787 --> 29:23.298
I think it's really been fairly consistent now 
because of the implementation of the various

29:12.787 --> 29:23.298
plans under different directors. There's been 
some transitional change, but I think that

29:25.040 --> 29:41.697
under our current director, there has been, I 
would say, the encouragement of public

29:25.040 --> 29:41.697
involvement. getting everybody to become 
involved, to participate in the planning

29:43.010 --> 29:51.141
process. And I think that this has happened under 
the current director, primarily. What

29:56.388 --> 30:00.974
contributions can you see that were made by past 
directors, those preceding Mr. Lilly?

30:06.342 --> 30:08.865
Well, we haven't had very many directors. In fact, 
I think the first director was very, very involved

30:09.655 --> 30:17.903
in the development of Town Lake. What was his name? 
I wish you hadn't asked me that at this point. I'll

30:23.548 --> 30:24.549
give it to you now. To the best of your recollection 
then, who was the first planning director with the

30:26.791 --> 30:31.696
department here? I believe the first one was Bill 
Parker. And that was before you were employed

30:35.599 --> 30:37.481
here? Yes. from seeing his contributions to the 
department and what he had left with the

30:39.372 --> 30:44.760
department. Can you see that his style of 
administration in the department impacted

30:45.701 --> 30:54.754
planning changes in comparison to his successor? 
I don't think that anymore, because I think that he

30:55.896 --> 31:00.823
was a dedicated planner. And he wanted the best for 
the community. He had a strong interest in the

31:05.003 --> 31:16.240
improvement and development of the... Actually, 
it was Colorado River at that time because we

31:05.003 --> 31:16.240
didn't have the lake, Town Lake, but all the 
riverfront. And it wasn't until recently that we

31:17.121 --> 31:22.710
had...
