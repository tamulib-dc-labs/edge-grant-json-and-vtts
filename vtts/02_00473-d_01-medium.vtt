WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:06.078
Well, I don't know what you call him, an alcoholic 
or not. He got drunk a lot, at least what I consider.

00:09.963 --> 00:11.845
So he had to be relieved, in other words. Yeah, he 
was moved out. Now, you say that you had bombers and

00:14.749 --> 00:19.716
fighters, a warning system.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.224
What was the size of each one of these wings that 
you... How many bombers did you have? How many

00:27.484 --> 00:28.205
fighters? How many men did you have? Well, the 38th 
Bomb Group was a B-26 outfit. It was located at

00:33.250 --> 00:53.730
Tama, Japan and it also had a 25th Type Recco 
squadron and oh I'd probably estimate that it had

00:33.250 --> 00:53.730
maybe about 30 B-26's and oh say 400 officers and 
men. Eighth Fighter Group over at the Shia was a

00:54.200 --> 01:05.754
P-51 outfit and it had three squadrons of P-51s and 
probably 15 airplanes each squadron. And the

01:07.055 --> 01:18.449
347th Fighter Interceptor Group was F-61s and 
they were located at Izuku and that was just a

01:07.055 --> 01:18.449
squadron. And then your Air Command and And the 
warning group was scattered at various radar

01:24.052 --> 01:32.862
sites throughout the area, and I would say maybe 
100 people at each one. All together, I would say

01:33.963 --> 01:36.526
probably about 5,000 people. 5,000 people that 
you commanded? I would say 5,000, maybe not that

01:38.688 --> 01:40.450
much. Or I would say around 2,500 maybe. Oh, okay, 
2,500. Yeah. All right. And what was your aim? What

01:53.124 --> 01:54.025
was the aim? Well, what were you there for? You were 
in the war. Obviously, occupation, you didn't

01:58.123 --> 02:05.091
have to keep the Japanese people down, according 
to your description of them. Why were you there?

02:06.352 --> 02:07.073
What was your mission? Well, to occupy Japan, 
actually. And you had your air command and warning

02:12.900 --> 02:22.932
group set up so that any aircraft from Russia or 
China, you would intercept. But most of it was the

02:23.198 --> 02:30.545
control of airplanes over Japan. I mean, you owned 
airplanes. They were Japan's air defense though.

02:36.571 --> 02:37.492
Air defense, yeah. They were completely cut out.

02:45.760 --> 02:52.767
You had, see we had two 315's and then you had the 
314's. One of them had the northern part of Japan

02:53.152 --> 02:57.299
and the other one had the southern part of Japan. 
And those were the two air defense systems in

02:57.319 --> 02:59.824
Japan? Yeah, and they were composite wings.

03:06.115 --> 03:16.493
Then you had a troop carrier group and

03:06.115 --> 03:16.493
troop carrier outfits and then you had an air 
Materiel Command. That consisted of the 5th Air

03:20.394 --> 03:23.659
Force. Okay. Now, during this period you had a 
shift

03:26.164 --> 03:44.775
from friendship with the Soviet Union, 
1944-1945, to

03:26.164 --> 03:44.775
unfriendly relations, enemies with the Soviet 
Union. by about 1947, 1948. You also have the

03:48.240 --> 03:53.724
Chinese Civil War in which the Communists won. Did 
you, what was the impact of this rising Cold War on

03:55.886 --> 04:07.996
the military in Japan?

04:08.017 --> 04:12.020
Well, other than being more alert, I don't think it 
had any impact. You weren't increased in size.

04:16.970 --> 04:21.516
Every once in a while you had an alert of an 
unidentified object. And sometimes you never

04:23.078 --> 04:27.104
knew what it was. And other times you decided it was 
a weather phenomenon that you were able to look

04:28.365 --> 04:40.041
over a mountain range and see moving boats or ships 
or something of this sort. But I don't... I think

04:46.670 --> 04:57.764
the biggest problem we had then was just training 
and getting the combat organizations that we had

04:46.670 --> 04:57.764
up to combat status. After all the pilots, all the 
experienced pilots and all the military

04:57.784 --> 05:10.601
experienced enlistment, we went home getting 
back into flying again. Okay, so your basic

05:11.122 --> 05:15.327
function then was to keep these units prepared in 
the case. Yeah. Okay, did you, on the island of

05:21.698 --> 05:26.946
Japan, did you have nuclear capabilities? Did you 
have American atomic bombs?

05:32.915 --> 05:33.696
I don't think so. No, I don't question it at that 
time. They were all, I'm sure, they were kept back

05:38.704 --> 05:42.830
on Guam. And we didn't have any airplanes that were 
capable of carrying a nuclear bomb. There's

05:49.000 --> 05:56.933
no reason to take atomic bombs into Japan. So back 
on Guam the B-52s or the B-29s

05:58.135 --> 06:08.432
at that time and a little bit later the B-36s and 
then? Those were the ones that were, our nuclear

06:09.070 --> 06:18.781
defense then was on the island of Guam and you never 
had those large bombers in Japan. Why didn't you

06:19.261 --> 06:21.464
have those large bombers in Japan? Well there's no 
place to put them really. You didn't have an

06:24.026 --> 06:26.389
airport large enough? Well the airfields that 
Japanese built just weren't built for those big

06:26.449 --> 06:31.374
airplanes.

06:34.137 --> 06:38.402
And I don't think that, I don't think we ever had any 
B-29 stationed in Japan. Now we had one or two that

06:44.977 --> 07:09.604
passed through there that landed at, we built an 
airport at Tachikawa and they had some record that

06:44.977 --> 07:09.604
they flew one of them back to the states and that 
they were trying to establish, which they did

06:44.977 --> 07:09.604
establish a record, a long range record. but they 
just weren't stationed there. So we had B-25s,

07:14.490 --> 07:25.545
A-26s, B-26s and P-51s

07:14.490 --> 07:25.545
and that type of airplane. This is your first 
overseas assignment except for the time that you

07:27.068 --> 07:34.998
went to England and that really wasn't a permanent 
assignment. What were your impressions of being

07:35.779 --> 07:39.945
in the Air Force overseas?

07:43.790 --> 07:48.635
It really didn't make any difference where we 
were. I went in the 11th of September of 45 and then

07:48.655 --> 08:00.246
moved into Johnson and then Lois and the two girls 
joined me in August of 46. And they brought an old

08:02.308 --> 08:13.138
automobile over, brought a 1940 Buick over.

08:14.671 --> 08:32.547
and we drove it all over Japan and it was really 
pretty nice when I was commanded 350 there

08:14.671 --> 08:32.547
division why I had a railroad car that I could have 
the Japanese hook on the rear of any train go

08:14.671 --> 08:32.547
anywhere in Japan. Really? Oh yeah, oh yeah. And we 
had opportunity to visit the many of the hot

08:44.860 --> 08:54.831
springs of Japan, the big hotels that the military 
had taken over as arrest hotels. And we had, well

08:55.351 --> 09:09.146
when I arrived in Japan, a Japanese assigned to me a 
Japanese soldier as my valet. Oh yeah. Could he

09:11.949 --> 09:13.230
translate also? Well, he couldn't translate. He 
could speak a little English, but he learned

09:16.358 --> 09:20.343
English. Then when Lois and the girls arrived over 
there, we were assigned two more

09:21.124 --> 09:33.378
girls, a housekeeper and a housemaid. In fact, you 
could get as many servants as you could fit. Oh

09:38.484 --> 09:39.125
really? Oh yeah. And the Japanese government paid 
for it. Yeah, we had a cook who was a cook on one of the

09:43.367 --> 09:56.659
big luxury liners that was owned on one of the 
Japanese luxury liners before the war. So his food

09:57.360 --> 09:58.521
was good. His food was good. He was really good. And 
he just cooked for you or for other families? Oh, he

10:03.626 --> 10:04.767
just cooked for us. Oh, wow. And so we had One house 
boy, one cook, and two house maids. I mean, a

10:14.496 --> 10:19.783
housekeeper and a nurse maid, whatever you call 
them. Did junior grade officers also get

10:19.803 --> 10:23.067
servants? Well, they may not have gotten as many. 
They got as many as they wanted to feed, actually.

10:31.298 --> 10:38.787
The Japanese were anxious to get more people out of 
the hungry line. Mm-hmm. I see, yeah. So this

10:43.701 --> 11:06.327
Japanese

10:43.701 --> 11:06.327
boy, before it all started, he washed all your 
clothes, and cleaned and pressed your trousers,

10:43.701 --> 11:06.327
cleaned your room, made your bed, and took care of 
you in general.

11:09.007 --> 11:10.989
He stayed with us the whole time. Now did you live on 
the base or did you live off the base? Well in

11:14.071 --> 11:20.978
Johnson, when I was in the 5th Bomber Command, I 
lived on base. We had a Quonset hut

11:21.018 --> 11:27.603
that you built yourself. This lady said here's 
some Quonset huts. If you want to build a house for

11:31.947 --> 11:38.473
you and your family, have at it and they give you an 
area where you can build it. So you got yourself

11:39.044 --> 11:46.414
some Japanese workers and you built yourself a 
house. And of course they were real good at ceramic

11:46.434 --> 11:53.244
tile and this type of thing. And then opening down 
at Nagare where we lived in a great big Japanese

11:55.907 --> 12:07.363
mansion off base. And then down in Izuzuki we lived 
on base. But down there you had a, by that time you

12:13.613 --> 12:26.552
had housing that was built to American 
specifications on base. And you had commanders

12:26.572 --> 12:30.037
going on the quarters that was built. But no, that 
tour was real. real nice really. And you visited

12:39.445 --> 12:45.013
most all of the hot spots. The Army took over most of 
the golf courses and

12:45.834 --> 13:05.683
of course we went looking one day, when we were down 
at Izuki, we went looking for

13:06.338 --> 13:20.776
a Methodist orphan's home, and we ended up in a 
Catholic orphan's home that the French nuns were

13:06.338 --> 13:20.776
running, and the French nuns couldn't go home. All 
the U.S. nuns were evacuated, but the French, once

13:21.337 --> 13:31.771
they leave France, why they stayed in Japan. Now we 
had a little So they couldn't go home during the

13:34.486 --> 13:37.289
war. They couldn't go home during the war at all. So 
they were still there and they were in bad, bad

13:38.290 --> 13:42.776
shape. You mean as far as supplies? Yeah, food, 
supplies. They'd be able to raise money and

13:47.241 --> 14:03.700
because Japan was real poor and we would take them a 
lot of food that we'd collect and kind of adopted

13:47.241 --> 14:03.700
them as And it was real interesting. It made you 
feel good. I betcha.

14:16.798 --> 14:18.581
So you had a good tour then in Japan. Oh yeah, that 
was a real good tour. And you could buy things real

14:20.844 --> 14:22.887
cheap. You buy big plates that are a couple of 
dollars a piece. Probably worth two or three or

14:31.388 --> 14:38.574
four hundred dollars the second time we went over 
there. Then you came back to the States. Let's move

14:41.677 --> 14:42.818
back here. Command of the United States Air Force 
Security Service 1949 to 1951. Tell

14:47.763 --> 14:51.506
me about that. Well see when I came back from Japan I 
went to the Air War College at Maxwell and I spent a

14:52.146 --> 14:59.093
year there. Oh that's right. And that was,

15:02.557 --> 15:17.374
I think we had about 100 Air Force officers, Air 
Force, Navy, and Marine, and Army officers going

15:02.557 --> 15:17.374
through there. And it was... What was that 
instituted? Was that first instituted about that

15:20.658 --> 15:22.740
time? Oh, I would say I was about the third class, or 
third or fourth class. And it was Well it was kind of

15:33.505 --> 15:36.569
an executive development type of program. I would 
think so. Probably a fairly elite assignment

15:37.230 --> 15:40.033
wasn't it? Yeah, in fact only about 2% of the 
officers in the Air Force ever get to attend it. Oh

15:46.542 --> 15:47.002
really? Well how can you account for the fact that 
you got to attend it? Well I don't know, I guess I had

15:50.707 --> 15:53.230
a good record. And did you apply for it? No, but I was 
Where I just happened to hit it probably at the

15:58.362 --> 16:01.847
right time. I was coming back from overseas and had 
a good time to go to school.

16:08.817 --> 16:10.239
What kind of classes did they have? Can you compare 
it to the way they ran West Plain? No, this was a pure

16:13.023 --> 16:18.551
and simple, an executive type of relaxing thing. 
You had seminars that you did a lot of talking back

16:18.611 --> 16:27.964
and forth on and you played golf. and your wives had 
courses in how to be a good Air Force wife. Really?

16:38.843 --> 16:40.005
Oh yeah. What did they tell her? Well, you had to 
support your husband in his career and Air

16:42.447 --> 16:54.981
Force etiquette.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.315
and all this type of thing. I mean it's more of a

16:57.415 --> 17:23.027
course of supporting the officers wives club, the 
NCO wives club and the airmen wives club and all

16:57.415 --> 17:23.027
this stuff and the social services that you, 
special services that you get into, family

16:57.415 --> 17:23.027
services. for new families coming on base, this 
type of thing. I wonder if in this day of woman's

17:26.538 --> 17:33.286
liberation they'd still have a course like that 
for the wives at the Aramore College. I don't know.

17:36.550 --> 17:50.787
I think they are because I think our daughter is 
involved in a briefing as to what their

17:36.550 --> 17:50.787
responsibilities are and their learning program 
is while her husband's at this school. Now tell me

17:51.931 --> 17:56.217
tell me what uh what type of classes you had? Well a 
lot of it was uh was uh strategy uh type of thing

17:58.681 --> 18:21.313
another one was communications how to how to 
communicate uh

17:58.681 --> 18:21.313
up and down within an organization a lot of 
management type of uh top management type of

18:21.901 --> 18:50.102
programs,

18:21.901 --> 18:50.102
human relations, responsibilities between the 
Air Force and the civilian community, how to keep

18:21.901 --> 18:50.102
that and joining the Chamber of Commerce and your 
various clubs that you have. and have a volunteer

18:50.588 --> 19:01.624
speaker's toastmaster type of organization on 
base so you can go out and tell them what the Air

18:50.588 --> 19:01.624
Force is doing. This type of thing. Community 
relations? Community relations type of thing.

19:05.850 --> 19:08.213
How about courses on leadership? Yeah, well you 
had, I can't remember specifically about any, but

19:08.233 --> 19:20.410
all of this, on human relations, senior media, 
personnel management, type of thing. And you had

19:23.947 --> 19:27.671
real outstanding lecturers. You had

19:27.731 --> 19:47.072
people like the president of General Motors or

19:27.731 --> 19:47.072
top executives in the industry would come down and 
talk to you about

19:50.663 --> 19:58.634
about personnel programs or executive programs 
or

19:50.663 --> 19:58.634
what it takes to be a leader type of thing. A lot of it 
was just

19:59.675 --> 20:05.603
a talk program. Communication, the ability to 
communicate with others? Yes.

20:12.291 --> 20:13.153
Did they give you grades? No. Did they have 
assignments? Yeah, they have assignments. Well

20:21.325 --> 20:50.320
during each phase you would have an outline of 
reading that you had to do and like Eisenhower

20:21.325 --> 20:50.320
White House, it may not have been at that 
particular, that's either National War College

20:21.325 --> 20:50.320
or there, but there was a long article in either 
Fortune or I think it was in Fortune which had on

20:21.325 --> 20:50.320
Eisenhower's White House. organize the White 
House, and how you use the staff, and things of this

20:51.025 --> 20:56.371
sort. What about courses on politics? How to get 
along with politicians for future generals,

20:59.374 --> 21:02.798
anything like that? Oh, I think you probably have a 
lot of that. Some of it, I don't remember exactly.

21:09.585 --> 21:19.536
I'm sure I have a curriculum out in my file, but I 
don't exactly remember. How large was each class?

21:21.637 --> 21:45.241
Or you had about 10 or 15 in each class and then you 
stayed with them maybe two weeks and during that

21:21.637 --> 21:45.241
two weeks you had a seminar party at somebody's 
house where everybody brought

21:21.637 --> 21:45.241
either dessert or meat or vegetables or what have 
you. So you got to know everybody in your seminar

21:46.102 --> 21:49.365
real well. How many total students were at the War 
College? Well, I think it was about a hundred at the

21:54.449 --> 21:56.391
time. And it was a one-year course? Well, yeah, she 
graduated 27th of June and you started out the

21:58.933 --> 22:05.621
latter part of August. I see. Do you think, overall 
now, thinking back on and thinking of your career,

22:08.584 --> 22:16.112
was it worthwhile Did you actually learn things 
about it? Well, I would say you think at the time

22:18.911 --> 22:32.905
that had you attended the War College before you 
were commander of the 315th, that you could have

22:18.911 --> 22:32.905
run the 315th Air Division a lot better. I see.

22:37.290 --> 22:43.356
Because it gave you a lot better insight on how to 
handle people. Yeah, sure. management, things

22:45.185 --> 22:46.987
that you're going to be doing.

22:49.990 --> 22:50.250
Yeah. Okay, let's shift now then to the commander 
of the United States Air Force Security Service.

22:56.136 --> 22:57.278
Can you tell me about that? Well, when I graduated 
from the Air War College, I really volunteered to

22:58.779 --> 23:06.327
go to Washington to be in personnel. I figured that 
there was a lot to be desired in personnel I figured

23:14.176 --> 23:27.916
that during my whole career, I don't think I got my 
first choice or even second choice as to what I

23:14.176 --> 23:27.916
wanted to do or where I wanted to be. And I figured 
that at least we should be able to hit it 50% of the

23:28.617 --> 23:32.263
time. But because I hadn't had any personnel 
experience, I got assigned to the Air Force

23:33.084 --> 23:38.752
Security Service. Well, the Air Force Security 
Service was just being organized at the time. And I

23:43.657 --> 23:59.282
didn't, when I inquired around when I got my orders 
as to what the airport security service was all

23:43.657 --> 23:59.282
about, why no one in the class knew anything about 
it. So I flew down to Brooks Field here in San

23:59.322 --> 24:05.732
Antonio to make a survey. Well, it was such a super 
secret organization why they wouldn't even let me

24:06.016 --> 24:10.102
in. Really?

24:14.269 --> 24:17.854
It was so secret that they wouldn't let you in, and 
you were destined to become the commander? Well,

24:18.195 --> 24:22.662
the thing about it, they didn't know that at that 
time. They hadn't seen any orders or anything. And

24:26.207 --> 24:27.589
you're supposed to have a clearance. You're 
supposed to have a background in investigation.

24:31.836 --> 24:34.740
And you didn't have a top secret security 
clearance? I'd been involved in a lot of top secret

24:35.429 --> 24:47.925
office, but at that time they didn't know my status 
and therefore they wouldn't let me in. So I came

24:49.086 --> 25:03.765
down and took command, well they had a Colonel Lynn 
who was a commander then and I took command about

24:49.086 --> 25:03.765
four days after I got here and he was transferred up 
to Washington. and it was a small outfit and then

25:04.657 --> 25:20.119
that was again a building program

25:04.657 --> 25:20.119
of establishing intercept stations worldwide.

25:22.643 --> 25:23.504
Intercept for what? Intercom in error? Intercept 
stations of anything that's radio, on the radio,

25:32.855 --> 25:45.389
on radio, you intercepted and tried to read 
everybody else's mail. Right. So, and Why do you

25:46.950 --> 25:53.257
think this was established, Air Force Security 
Service? Well, when we, see we had, where you have

25:53.337 --> 26:00.465
the, right at the time, you had the Army, and the 
Navy had an organization such as this, and when we

26:02.605 --> 26:22.910
separated, then the Army gave up some experienced 
people, and so the Air Force formed a security

26:02.605 --> 26:22.910
service. So each organization has its own 
intercept, and it's quite important when you're

26:22.930 --> 26:32.342
up close to the enemy lines to be able to intercept 
any direction

26:33.841 --> 26:45.956
that you have on guns, on their artillery, or 
anything of that sort.

26:49.681 --> 26:55.208
So it's basically

26:49.681 --> 26:55.208
that type of organization. Did you have any 
relations with the CIA, which was established in

26:56.943 --> 27:01.427
1947? I mean, it sounds like you're doing some of 
the same things that they're doing. Well, the CIA,

27:05.690 --> 27:12.956
we put a lot of information in the CIA, and also the 
Army and the Navy. And yeah, I had a lot of, as

27:14.798 --> 27:26.848
Commander of the Security Service, I was on the 
National Security Intelligence Committee. and

27:27.757 --> 27:35.969
which the director of CIA, I believe, was the 
chairman of that type of thing.

27:40.855 --> 27:43.699
It was really pretty well coordinated.

27:46.804 --> 27:52.752
There

27:46.804 --> 27:52.752
was a lot of jealousy between the CIA and its 
ability to produce intelligence vis-a-vis the

27:53.677 --> 28:03.554
military intelligence field. Oh, really? Well, 
it's always been that way. A lot of rivalry? A lot of

28:07.861 --> 28:09.705
rivalry. Which one does a better job, the military 
or the CIA? They're really different fields,

28:17.909 --> 28:20.392
actually. Could you explain? No, I don't know. I 
don't think I can.

28:31.864 --> 28:46.380
Well, the civilians and the military 
intelligence and the civilians and CIA are big

28:31.864 --> 28:46.380
competitors of production of intelligence. and 
who's right and who's wrong when they produce a

28:47.795 --> 28:55.044
piece of intelligence.

29:01.212 --> 29:04.416
But that was a very interesting command. Again, 
you were building and that was my specialty and I

29:04.456 --> 29:15.169
moved from there up to Deputy Director, National 
Security Agency. So, you have two jobs right in a

29:18.914 --> 29:28.985
row from 1949 to 1951, then from 1951 to 1953 that 
deals with intelligence and security. Yeah.

29:30.527 --> 29:32.369
Well, see, I was in communications. Sure. That's 
why you were chosen, because you were in

29:33.210 --> 29:36.094
communications. Is that what you think? Yeah, 
well,

29:37.055 --> 29:44.143
most of all of the what you did there was intercept 
radio signals. And that was, and the National

29:50.386 --> 30:14.029
Security, well that deputy director was a job of 
which I was pretty well bored at, because you

29:50.386 --> 30:14.029
really, it was a staff job of which you was 
responsible for keeping the Air Force informed as

29:50.386 --> 30:14.029
to what was going on in the National Security 
Agency. and wanted to be sure that they got all of

30:14.566 --> 30:18.472
the intelligence that was produced.

30:21.097 --> 30:24.923
But you really didn't have any command 
responsibility. And

30:24.963 --> 30:31.834
you'd been a commander before, so this is... So I 
got quite bored there, and that's when I, it was

30:31.854 --> 30:41.350
during this time that I got my master's degree in 
business administration. Okay, we're going to

30:41.617 --> 30:43.119
talk about that in a minute. Let's talk about the 
relations that you had with the CIA and the

30:43.139 --> 30:48.766
National Security Agency. How did you work with 
those people? Well, we provided them with all our

30:52.391 --> 31:04.367
products, and then of course they, I presume,

31:07.520 --> 31:23.014
you know, had all the other sort of, numerous other 
sources of intelligence, and they, their

31:07.520 --> 31:23.014
responsibility was to tie them all together, to be 
sure that the stuff that their agents picked up

31:07.520 --> 31:23.014
by...
