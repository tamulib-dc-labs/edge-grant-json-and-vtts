WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:07.535
And he presented, and the staff said, well, 
Colonel, that sounds pretty good. I would go along

00:07.856 --> 00:08.917
with it. I wouldn't fight it, because even though I 
may not like it, it wasn't my idea. That doesn't

00:13.543 --> 00:16.207
mean that I shouldn't accept it. And I said, 
whatever's good for the unit, let's go with it. In

00:20.212 --> 00:26.580
other words, as far as leadership was concerned, 
what you feel is one of your assets is flexibility.

00:27.802 --> 00:28.603
Would you say that? I would say that 
wholeheartedly. I was flexible in mine. I know I'm

00:31.891 --> 00:37.157
not the smartest man in the world, I know that. And 
yet I could, I feel I was astute in gleaming

00:37.177 --> 00:49.971
somebody's ideas and using them. And that helped 
me along the way. Yeah, we all need excellent

00:52.074 --> 00:53.976
subordinates. Oh, yeah. If you don't have them, 
you can't make them. I don't know, I like these,

00:56.439 --> 01:01.324
even in civilian life, these corporations stuff, 
you know. those companies that failed is because

01:01.405 --> 01:31.227
friends were in there and positioned and family 
you know and trying to run a corporation didn't

01:01.405 --> 01:31.227
have the great matter to do it let's continue now 
with 1964

01:01.405 --> 01:31.227
let's continue with your career in the reserves 
what happened after well in 1964 command the

01:01.405 --> 01:31.227
second brigade 90th infantry infantry And did you 
get a promotion along with that? I got a promotion

01:35.251 --> 01:36.733
along with that. I was a lieutenant colonel. And 
General Travis, Bob Travis of San Antonio, was a

01:43.020 --> 01:46.965
commanding general. And he recommended to 4th 
Army at the time that I take over the infantry

01:48.287 --> 01:57.277
brigade in Houston. And there was a lot of 
resistance to it. Why? Because I was a lieutenant

02:02.585 --> 02:03.926
colonel. They said they had colonels in the area 
who they felt should take over the job. But General

02:15.140 --> 02:19.625
Travis insisted and stuck to his guns. He said, 
well, what good did it do Kokonos to do such a

02:19.665 --> 02:26.973
superior job as a battalion commander if I can't 
promote him? And so finally they did. remaining

02:31.602 --> 02:34.024
general of the Fifth Army, he said, okay. And so 
they put me in that job, and General Travis called

02:34.825 --> 02:42.993
me to Austin, Texas, the headquarters, and pinned 
my eagles on me. Oh, yeah, it was a great thrill. It

02:45.496 --> 02:46.136
really was. That was a big step. Almost as big as 
from Colonel to General. It really was a big step.

02:53.183 --> 02:59.249
And so I took over the infantry brigade, and I 
walked into a harness nest. Tell me about that

02:59.850 --> 03:00.951
brigade. no sense mentioning the former 
commander's name. And he was an Aggie. No kidding?

03:09.128 --> 03:10.129
And the place was a mess? Well, the staff was a mess. 
He liked certain type of people. And when I walked

03:16.876 --> 03:23.863
in there, I could sense that my executive officer 
was just not on the team. And he was, you know, I

03:25.405 --> 03:30.330
could see that he was upset because he didn't get 
the command, and he was upset because the old

03:30.732 --> 03:37.702
commander was gone, and I was a new commander 
coming in. And I sensed it immediately. What rank

03:40.947 --> 03:41.768
was he? Lieutenant Colonel. And I was Lieutenant 
Colonel. So after the second- Was he senior in

03:45.533 --> 03:47.275
time? No, I was senior. And

03:50.941 --> 03:58.892
after the second meeting, I called him in and told 
him to find another job. Really? Yes. What did he

04:00.601 --> 04:01.362
say to that? He said, you can't do that to me. I said, 
yes, I can. I said, yes, I can. I command this unit,

04:08.212 --> 04:12.979
and I'm the commander, and you go find you another 
home somewhere else. No kidding. And don't show up

04:14.141 --> 04:15.523
the next meeting. He said, you can't do that. You 
have to go through the Army Reserve Command and

04:17.445 --> 04:20.109
through Army. I said, I'm telling you to find you 
another home. You're not fit to be the executive

04:23.494 --> 04:27.680
officer of this regiment or brigade. So... Did he 
show up next time? He did not show up. Well, in the

04:33.498 --> 04:36.582
meantime, I called General Travis, told him what I 
was doing. General Travis concurred. He says,

04:38.304 --> 04:43.450
you're the brigade commander, and you do what you 
want to down there, and I'll support you 100%. How

04:44.311 --> 04:45.212
can you beat that? That's right. It really makes 
you feel good when you've got a commander behind

04:46.234 --> 04:48.596
you. And I learned that. And so that's what I did to 
my men. And so I pulled a major up, Major Bill

04:52.922 --> 04:58.269
Nieder. He was the adjutant. And I pulled him up. At 
meetings, I just looked at staff over and

05:02.726 --> 05:08.512
evaluated them. And I got my feeling. I could feel 
who I wanted to be my key staff people. And so I asked

05:17.922 --> 05:20.145
Major Nieder. I called him in. I says, Major 
Nieder, you're my executive officer, and I'm

05:20.906 --> 05:27.513
going to promote you lieutenant colonel. He says, 
over all these other people? I says, Major Nieder.

05:31.591 --> 05:33.333
I said, you're going to be my exec officer. You want 
the job? Yes, sir. OK. Well, Bill and I became very

05:36.076 --> 05:39.880
dear friends. And he did a tremendous job for me.

05:47.227 --> 05:52.493
I got some criticism from the former commander for 
me selecting Nader. When I got that, I knew I'd

05:53.134 --> 05:55.416
selected the right man. I see. And so anyway, we 
worked together. We revamped the staff. So that

06:02.371 --> 06:03.893
was the first major problem. That was my first 
major problem. And the unit, the disciplinary,

06:06.377 --> 06:10.542
the discipline wasn't so good. But after several 
meetings where they perked up, men knew I meant

06:11.824 --> 06:17.352
business. It was strictly business. And I began to 
visit the staff members to see just, you know, what

06:19.755 --> 06:27.966
was going on and everything. In fact, one of the 
staff members was a county judge down in Near Eagle

06:32.830 --> 06:33.591
Lake. I think he's a federal judge now. Really? 
Yeah. And I had a, one of my battalion commanders

06:38.037 --> 06:42.683
was an internal revenue man. Shawrock, Jim 
Shawrock. And let me say something else. You know

06:48.771 --> 06:49.231
him. He's at A&M, Jim Bradley. I've heard of him. 
You heard him. He's in the economic development,

06:54.358 --> 06:58.403
Dr. Bradley. Jim Bradley was a lieutenant 
colonel. and Brian he had a battalion down there

07:02.547 --> 07:31.407
this infantry battalion and he was my senior and 
when he wasn't selected oh he was the acting

07:02.547 --> 07:31.407
brigade regiment brigade commander until I got 
selected and the minute I got selected Jim came and

07:02.547 --> 07:31.407
I knew Jim and he knew me from training and 
everything from school came to me and he says,

07:31.724 --> 07:47.941
Colonel Coconose, and we knew each other by first 
name, Jim or Mike, you know, he didn't call me Mike,

07:31.724 --> 07:47.941
he says, Colonel Coconose, he says, you're my 
commanding officer and whatever you want me to do,

07:31.724 --> 07:47.941
I'm willing to do it. And he says, you want me to step 
aside and let somebody else take this battalion,

07:49.122 --> 07:56.150
I'd be glad to do it. He says, whatever you want to 
do, it's up to you. And I looked at him, and I says,

07:59.872 --> 08:03.938
Jim, I want you to be the battalion commander. And 
he shook my hand. We shook hands, and it was the

08:05.780 --> 08:13.712
greatest friendship I can enjoy, and I still enjoy 
it today with Jim Bradley. That's great. It really

08:14.833 --> 08:15.775
is. Because he was senior, and he was expected to be 
named the commander, and he wasn't. Because he'd

08:22.725 --> 08:24.047
been in that regiment. Sounds like a big man, 
though. Big man, really. And he's pretty

08:26.310 --> 08:29.254
powerful. prominent there. He's not in the 
teaching anymore. He's in the development of

08:33.999 --> 08:36.722
economic development. And he goes to all the 
chamber of commerce and helps them in their

08:36.822 --> 08:42.027
city-wide. He's been to Beaumont and helped them 
in their economic development. But Jim was very

08:45.530 --> 08:48.273
gracious. And so

08:48.373 --> 08:54.519
I kept him on. And then I had an armored battalion. 
tank commander named Leo Connor in Midland,

08:57.348 --> 09:02.473
Texas. And he was a problem. And I finally had to ask 
him to resign. Now did you ask him to resign from the

09:07.097 --> 09:12.062
reserves or did you just tell him to resign from 
your staff? I had to handle him differently. But in

09:13.723 --> 09:23.492
general, did you have these people just resign 
from your staff and like you said go find some other

09:13.723 --> 09:23.492
position in the reserves someplace or did you have 
to try to get them out of the service? Well, I had to

09:23.613 --> 09:26.275
treat this exec officer like this because he was I 
had to hit him quick and get him out. He had other

09:29.235 --> 09:31.438
problems that I didn't want to linger. I didn't 
want him to linger. But I went to see Colonel

09:32.939 --> 09:39.826
Connor, and he had given General Travis problems, 
the division commander. So I had to handle him a

09:40.246 --> 09:41.868
little different. And I went to him and said, now, 
Leo, you have to just, we just have to get another

09:42.749 --> 09:52.178
commander down here. You flunked the IG for 
several, couple of times, and inspections are

09:52.664 --> 09:59.891
bad, and you're treating the division staff like 
dirt. I said, we can't have that. So he said, Mike,

10:02.314 --> 10:03.935
you're right. I'll do it. And so we. He was. So he 
retired from the service? Well, no, he went to

10:08.320 --> 10:09.621
another unit. And everything began to straighten 
out down there. I'd fly to Midland and see him and

10:15.307 --> 10:20.832
visit with him until we got this thing all 
straightened out. And I want to ask you a question

10:21.200 --> 10:23.704
about General Travis. With all of these people who 
could have taken over, why do you think he picked

10:23.944 --> 10:29.013
you?

10:32.017 --> 10:33.620
Why do you have so much confidence in you? Of 
course, General Kidwell, who was my Daivari

10:33.640 --> 10:47.983
commander, who I worked for, went to bat for him, 
would tell him, says, Colonel Coker knows who's

10:33.640 --> 10:47.983
getting all these superiors on the, on the firing 
range and who's getting these superiors on

10:48.503 --> 10:57.232
maneuvers, RSOP, constant selection occupation 
position. He's getting our superiors. He's the

10:59.995 --> 11:05.021
one that's really doing a great job for division 
artillery and deserves a promotion. And Travis

11:05.041 --> 11:07.263
began to watch me. I knew that. I knew he'd come to 
the field. And I knew he was evaluating me. But it

11:12.509 --> 11:13.670
didn't make any difference. I never put on a show 
for anybody. I always had a show going, don't get me

11:18.085 --> 11:20.608
wrong. Right, it was your own. Yeah, it was my own, 
that's right. That's somebody else's. We were

11:26.115 --> 11:28.839
spitting polish in the field. I met them all shave 
every day, bathe every day. We'd go out to the field

11:33.304 --> 11:35.647
for four or five days at a time. I met them all, put on 
new tees every day. And I would see that they were

11:40.653 --> 11:44.178
laundered and back so they could change. And hot 
meals in the field. possible. Oh yeah. So in other

11:50.526 --> 11:53.630
words you tried to treat your men as well as 
possible. Oh, listen, I always did. Your idea was

11:58.335 --> 12:03.541
they'll treat you the same way. So General Kidwell 
really led the fight with Travis to get me to take

12:03.561 --> 12:12.311
over that. General Travis, you know, he felt 
strongly about it that he Stood his ground. Yeah,

12:19.239 --> 12:22.082
you're right. I guess you're right. Terry felt I 
could get the job done. Because the track record

12:27.767 --> 12:30.450
was good. OK, now let's go to the next. After the 
command of that brigade, then what? What was the

12:41.861 --> 12:42.681
next move? Go. That was tragic. McNamara became 
Secretary of Defense, and he eliminated the

12:47.945 --> 12:53.892
combat arms and the reserve program. Oh, really? 
Oh, yeah. All the divisions, all the United

12:55.774 --> 12:57.436
States. That was tragic. So what happened to you? 
Well, now let me tell you. So this is 1966 then?

13:06.026 --> 13:06.347
Right. General is probably going to the 75th 
Maneuver Area Command. Yeah, I know this, but I

13:10.291 --> 13:12.474
don't understand what that means. Okay.

13:16.779 --> 13:17.800
The order came out. that the original order came 
out that the National Guard would be dissolved and

13:18.826 --> 13:29.917
put into their army reserve. It would be one army 
reserve.

13:34.582 --> 13:37.264
And politics took over real strong. The governors 
really got hot. Because the National Guard are

13:40.468 --> 13:42.269
governor troops. And they're not federal troops 
like the reserve. Even in the armor drilling,

13:48.998 --> 14:01.571
they're state troopers until they're called up by 
the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of the Army.

14:02.211 --> 14:03.493
Then they're federal troops. Even in summer 
training, they're not federal troops. They're

14:05.755 --> 14:07.056
still guards, state guards. But anyway,

14:07.076 --> 14:16.666
the guard fought it, fought it, fought it, and 
McNamara reversed himself completely. He says,

14:16.686 --> 14:17.807
okay, we'll put these. Army Reserve combat arms, 
infantry, artillery, armored, and combat

14:18.901 --> 14:26.808
engineers into the Guard.

14:29.931 --> 14:30.972
So we fought it too. But we were under the command of 
the Secretary of Defense. So we couldn't do any

14:36.657 --> 14:41.202
political action at all, you know. He was our 
commander, actually, Secretary of Defense under

14:41.602 --> 14:44.885
the President. And President Johnson was was the 
president then, Lyndon Johnson. And he went along

14:49.577 --> 14:53.822
with McNamara. It was a big mistake. Really, it was 
a trap. Because the quality of personnel in the

14:56.805 --> 15:09.618
Army Reserve was head and shoulder above anything 
in the National Guard, especially the combat

14:56.805 --> 15:09.618
arms. And here we had eight divisions in the United 
States, highly trained. In the 9th Division,

15:15.922 --> 15:25.454
Texas, we had close to 9,000 people, which was 
almost 100% strength for a division. Highly

15:25.474 --> 15:26.295
trained. Combat veterans, either the World War II 
or Korea, and here he is dissolving them, getting

15:27.296 --> 15:36.247
rid of them. Well, we got the order, no more 9th 
Division. And so then General Travis called a

15:40.932 --> 15:44.697
division commander's meeting and bring your 
staff, so we brought our staffs to Austin. And he

15:49.078 --> 15:56.486
said that he was going to continue the 9th Division 
on a non-pay status. What does that mean? Means we

15:57.227 --> 16:14.768
would continue to drill at the Armory under our old 
unit designation, like the 2nd Brigade of the

15:57.227 --> 16:14.768
90th, and that we would not get paid We didn't know 
if we could go to summer training camp or not. What

16:20.103 --> 16:23.287
they call a non-pay status unit. And so he wanted to 
know how many of us would go along with him.

16:28.433 --> 16:39.385
Figuring that if we did that, then maybe McNamara 
would see our desire and our dedication to the Army

16:28.433 --> 16:39.385
Reserve and that he would change his mind. And he 
didn't continue if he didn't. So we, 100%. Really?

16:46.753 --> 16:47.053
100%. We all said, yes, we'd stay with you. Well, 
after a month or so, Travis, General Travis found

16:49.836 --> 17:01.770
out it was fruitless to, useless to even continue 
that way because we weren't getting the support of

16:49.836 --> 17:01.770
the Department of the Army. McNamara wasn't going 
to change his mind. And the Department of the Army

17:04.052 --> 17:09.478
was going to pull in our flags and guide-ons and 
take away our equipment. And it would just be a

17:10.759 --> 17:13.142
little stag meeting. And so... Travis says, okay. 
He calls us back in again. He says, where are they

17:18.694 --> 17:24.583
going to assign you to the National Guard units? So 
if you don't like your assignment and you want to

17:25.784 --> 17:35.438
continue, well, come back to Austin and we'll 
organize our own non-unit headquarters. Well, my

17:36.600 --> 17:42.568
brigade people in Houston got assigned to the 75th 
Maneuver Area Command. 75th Maneuver Area

17:43.696 --> 17:45.417
Command. Which is part of the National Guard. No, 
no. Okay, let me explain that to you. We had a

17:53.484 --> 17:54.405
choice. We had a choice to go to the Guard, 36th 
Division, or to any reserve unit that we could find

17:56.047 --> 18:02.292
a home. Oh, I see. See? So we had to seek our own home 
if we didn't want to go to the Guard. So you found the

18:09.999 --> 18:12.741
75th Maneuver Area Command. command, and this is 
what took you out of the artillery, basically, and

18:12.974 --> 18:26.630
then you're in this petroleum intersection, 
which I have no idea what that is, which seems quite

18:12.974 --> 18:26.630
different from anything you've done, and I could 
not figure that out when I was reading through

18:12.974 --> 18:26.630
this. We'll take that step by step. We got 
assigned, we asked to be assigned, my brigade

18:28.772 --> 18:34.920
people, we had to take inventory or counter. How 
many wanted to go to the guard? Nobody. None of my

18:37.903 --> 18:38.644
officers. Nobody. Nobody wanted to go to the 
guard. How many officers were there in general,

18:41.485 --> 18:45.172
approximately? Thirty-some-odd officers on my 
staff. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Not a single one of them

18:49.500 --> 18:52.986
wanted to go to the guard. Because you considered 
it that inferior. That's right. Now, a couple of

18:56.692 --> 19:01.241
the enlisted men went to the guard because they got 
promoted. They told the enlisted men, If he was a

19:02.941 --> 19:06.866
buck sergeant, they'd promote him to a 
four-striper or a five-striper. So several of the

19:07.247 --> 19:09.349
enlisted men, which was fine. They went to the 
Guard. But not a single man went to the National

19:10.711 --> 19:14.035
Guard. And so I said, okay, we'll all go. I'll go see 
General Davis. He was the commander of the 75th New

19:20.223 --> 19:23.568
Area Command. Felix Davis. He was the commander.

19:30.447 --> 19:32.189
And where was the 75th? In the armory at the Old 
Spaniards Trail in Houston. Okay, that was

19:35.513 --> 19:36.494
headquarters. Headquarters. The 75th Maneuver 
Every Command is a command post type exercise

19:39.237 --> 19:46.506
headquarters. They put on exercises, map 
maneuvers, command post exercise, and field

19:47.046 --> 19:54.415
exercises. And they go out and umpire. Oh, so 
they're sort of umpires. They're umpires.

19:59.301 --> 19:59.661
Exactly. They're umpires. And so we went to that 
unit. Now, how did you get in? Weren't they filled?

20:08.075 --> 20:09.377
They were filled. But Department of the Army said 
they could take us all in as excess. In other words,

20:16.526 --> 20:20.031
the Department of the Army sort of got around 
McNamara. They sure did. And said you can go to the

20:21.132 --> 20:24.036
75th as excess office for one year. And after that 
one year, you had to find your slot to get into. a

20:30.134 --> 20:31.716
position. So we all went over there and General 
Davis, shall I mention names? Okay, General Davis

20:41.766 --> 20:50.474
assigned everybody a slot except Colonel Nieder 
and I. In the meantime, Major Nieder became a

20:50.494 --> 20:56.180
colonel and we became dear friends. But prior to 
assignment, he called me in And he says, now, you

20:59.868 --> 21:04.252
know these people, where should they be assigned? 
And I did. I went down the staff roster, and I said,

21:04.813 --> 21:16.684
put Robinson in the aviation, put in the training 
area. And he said, well, don't worry about . And

21:18.165 --> 21:20.347
then we went on down the line. And so when we got 
through, he said, well, Colonel ,, I don't know

21:21.068 --> 21:28.014
where we're going to assign you. We don't have a 
spot for you. I said, all right, how about Colonel

21:30.884 --> 21:32.185
Eater? Well, we don't have a spot for him either. So 
I said, okay, that's fine. You said, would you like

21:37.990 --> 21:39.632
to stay in the unit? I said, sure, we'll stay as 
excess. It wasn't a friendly meeting. No, it

21:44.877 --> 21:47.539
doesn't sound like friendly. No. It sounded like 
he was very jealous, isn't it? Very jealous. He was

21:50.542 --> 21:52.083
jealous of the 9th Division. And we had a run-in. 
Because you did such a good job before? Well, my

21:57.628 --> 22:00.891
reputation did perceive me But we sat on the armory 
council together. And General Davis was chairman

22:05.112 --> 22:07.975
of the armory council. And the army council 
composed of the commanders in the building. He

22:13.160 --> 22:14.261
commanded one unit. I commanded the brigade 
headquarters. And also there was an infantry

22:18.285 --> 22:21.308
battalion in there. And then there was a medical 
commander. And then there was a transportation

22:24.591 --> 22:26.814
commander. And there was one of those five 
commanders. sent on the council. And they ran the

22:32.715 --> 22:33.736
armory. They allocated the spaces. And they 
determined which offices would be open. He wanted

22:41.288 --> 22:48.699
all his offices closed that his people trained in, 
and nobody could use them. Well, if we did that, we

22:48.719 --> 22:52.544
wouldn't have an armory to train in, see? And we 
tried to tell him that. He says, you've got to leave

22:54.527 --> 22:55.669
your office open. You can't do it. He says, I won't 
do it. See, like these offices here. Well, a

23:01.190 --> 23:05.595
commander, we said we'd have a common office for a 
commander.

23:08.278 --> 23:13.144
And since you're a general officer, we will give 
you a desk. You lock your desk, put all your papers

23:13.164 --> 23:15.887
in, and we won't touch it. We'll bring our files in. 
He didn't want that. He wanted his own general

23:19.772 --> 23:21.334
office. And I can understand. But he wanted to give 
all his key staff people offices. and locked the

23:28.807 --> 23:29.628
door. Well, we just didn't have that kind of room. 
If you could see the building, Terry. Oh, no, we

23:34.954 --> 23:35.895
didn't have it. It was an old, antiquated building 
built back in 1930 or something. And he didn't want

23:39.258 --> 23:40.800
to share it. He didn't want to share it. He was very 
selfish. So we resisted it, and I voted him. And we

23:49.449 --> 23:53.013
sent it to the Army commander in the Fifth or Fourth 
Army. What do you mean you voted him? We had a vote.

23:55.816 --> 23:58.459
What we would do with the offices. Because he voted 
to close the office, and we all, four to one, voted

23:59.468 --> 24:05.214
to open them. And he didn't accept that majority. 
And he came to me after the meeting, and he says, you

24:07.095 --> 24:12.601
led this revolt against me, and I'm going to hold it 
against you. I said, General Davis, sir, no, sir.

24:14.743 --> 24:17.225
I'm not revolting against you. I just don't think 
it's fair. Well, I'm pointing this finger at you.

24:20.529 --> 24:26.134
And he used some profanity, and I maintained my 
composure, and I said, no, sir. I said, we just feel

24:26.198 --> 24:31.884
like it's fair that we leave the office open. So by 
the time then that you went down to the 75th

24:33.946 --> 24:40.292
maneuver, the stage was already set, so to speak. 
Set, right. And I said, this happened about a year

24:40.632 --> 24:45.077
and a half, two years before I got there. So when I 
got there, he didn't have a spot for me. And I said,

24:50.262 --> 24:50.763
that's fine. What you probably knew was. Well, 
that he was upset with me. So I said, that's all

24:55.595 --> 24:57.297
right. And so what did you do for the next year then? 
So I trained with him. I stayed with him. I said,

25:01.702 --> 25:06.107
well, now, can I train with you? Sure. He says, I'm 
going to assign you to the S3 section. Colonel

25:10.973 --> 25:12.575
Hayden, full colonel. But then he said he didn't 
have a... Well, he didn't have a... I was over. I was

25:15.158 --> 25:15.819
at surplus. See, remember, for a year, we could 
stay one year at surplus. Okay. At surplus. Well,

25:22.226 --> 25:25.450
we start meeting... That's when they started 
weekend trainings then. We used to meet once a week

25:30.550 --> 25:34.456
until they would start weekend training. So the 
first meeting I went in, Carlos Hayden was my, he

25:34.496 --> 25:42.888
was the operation officer, and he was a full 
colonel, I was a full colonel. And he operated me

25:44.430 --> 25:51.440
maybe a couple of years. But it didn't really mean 
much. I mean, you could be full colonels, but

25:53.022 --> 25:56.888
really rank doesn't mean that much. But I'll tell 
you, Terry, great. My combat record, no one could

26:02.715 --> 26:05.879
question it. And that just stood before him all the 
time. The Silver Star, the Purple Heart, the three

26:10.786 --> 26:27.549
combat stars, the European, and that in the group, 
it was a great plus for me. Yeah. And then,

26:28.863 --> 26:34.110
this unit was kind of a sloppy unit. The dress 
wasn't so good, and some come unshaved, wasn't

26:35.953 --> 26:42.021
shaved. I come in, I was sparkle, what am I telling 
you? And I purposely made it that way, that I would

26:46.207 --> 26:58.684
shine my boots longer and louder and shinier so 
they would look better, and my fatigues were

26:58.917 --> 27:01.540
heavily starched. You could sit them in the 
corner, they were so starched. Oh, yeah. And my

27:05.064 --> 27:09.108
weight was down, and I was trim. And I just kept my 
military bearing, and I knew I had to. This is one

27:18.719 --> 27:25.667
time, early in the conversation, I mentioned 
that, you know, there were some prejudices.

27:26.474 --> 27:31.901
After the second or third meeting, Carlos Hayden 
was turning to me to tell him what to do. Really?

27:33.002 --> 27:33.282
Right. How to run an Infra Brigade field exercise. 
The National Guard had asked us to put on a field

27:39.230 --> 27:45.177
exercise for the 36th Division at Fort Hood for the 
summer. And they wanted a retrograde movement and

27:45.718 --> 27:49.803
also a river crossing. And he asked me to set the 
plan up. And I did. I got Major Eater. He just wasn't

27:57.416 --> 27:58.798
capable of doing it. Well, he just... He knew you 
could do a better job. Yes, so I went and got Colonel

28:01.983 --> 28:03.805
Eater. He said, get you three or four officers and 
work this plan. I got Colonel Eater and I got

28:06.329 --> 28:11.877
Edwards, my other officer, and we sat down and we 
worked the plan out. He took it in the colonel to

28:12.398 --> 28:14.461
General Davis. And I have to admit, General Davis 
called me in and he congratulated me. He says, I got

28:20.489 --> 28:21.871
a job for you now. I'm going to make you the plans 
officer. This was after about the... So your year

28:27.278 --> 28:28.840
wasn't up yet? No, this was about my second or third 
month. So it was a stormy beginning, but then they

28:31.484 --> 28:35.669
could see your usefulness. That's right. I could 
be used. And so he made me the plan officer. Oh,

28:40.315 --> 28:40.876
good. So I made all the plans for the 75th Maneuver 
Air Commandment. And it's like Operation

28:44.641 --> 28:49.487
Officer, but I was under the Operation Officer, 
but I was his planner. And so from that day on,

28:49.507 --> 28:53.232
General Davis... asked me to do the briefings at 
Army headquarters. I would go to the Army

28:57.921 --> 29:09.192
commander and had to present them the plans of what 
we were going to do for 36th Division or the 49th

28:57.921 --> 29:09.192
Armored Division. And General Davis asked me to 
present the plan operation of the whole thing, and

29:10.013 --> 29:18.401
I would be the briefing officer at the Army. You did 
have a lot of responsibility there. Oh, gosh. In

29:21.544 --> 29:22.965
fact, we He would take the whole staff with him, 
about 15, 20 officers, and there were colonels and

29:23.249 --> 29:35.066
lieutenant colonels, and there were three 
generals, General Davis, General Frazier, and

29:23.249 --> 29:35.066
General, oh, I forgot his name. Anyway, they would 
all go to the briefing, and we'd go to Fort Sam

29:35.306 --> 29:45.300
Houston, say a Thursday night, and we'd brief 
Friday morning, and they liked to party. And I

29:47.343 --> 29:48.905
wouldn't party. I mean, I'd be in a party, but I'd 
drink water, because I didn't want to. I knew what I

29:53.641 --> 29:57.087
had to do the next morning, and General Davis said, 
what's the matter, you don't drink? I said, yes

29:57.648 --> 29:58.770
sir, I drink. I drink just as much as you or anybody 
else, but I got a job to do in the morning, I want to be

29:59.371 --> 30:04.860
clear. Well, it partied all night long at the VIP 
headquarters, I mean, B.O.Q. Hell, next morning I

30:10.970 --> 30:19.024
was up bright and early, got all my damn slides 
ready, and I got my briefing notes, and And hell,

30:19.358 --> 30:23.703
I'd run a mile or two before everybody else that got 
up. And so at the briefing, man, hell, I hit the Army

30:24.344 --> 30:33.716
commander three-star general right in the eye 
with our briefing. Anyway,

30:34.577 --> 30:38.882
I did him a good job. And he liked it. Made him look 
good. Made him look damn good. I wrote some

30:45.470 --> 30:49.315
operations in China. wrote a plan of a field 
exercise in Cambodia before the Vietnam War. It's

30:57.170 --> 30:58.272
still in their files. How to maneuver tanks in 
Cambodia. And I was briefing the army commander on

31:02.718 --> 31:17.918
this Cambodia exercise, and I threw in two armored 
divisions, and his operation, Colonel Abush, was

31:18.775 --> 31:21.699
the regular army operation officer. He jumped 
straight up in there and says, you can't use tanks

31:22.120 --> 31:25.825
in Cambodia. And I says, well, Colonel Abish, we 
certainly can't. Never. No one has ever put tanks

31:29.831 --> 31:31.814
in Cambodia. Why aren't you realistic about this? 
Don't be hypothetical in saying you can. In front

31:38.424 --> 31:43.111
of the commander, in front of the guard, General 
Bishop was there, the action general. And so I

31:43.972 --> 31:47.297
said, well, Colonel Abish, I'll tell you what we 
did. We went to Fort Knox, Kentucky, and we

31:47.783 --> 31:59.433
presented this plan, before we presented it to you 
here today, and presented it to the armored people

31:47.783 --> 31:59.433
and see if they could put armor to camera, and they 
said they could do it 100%. Now, if the armored

32:00.294 --> 32:03.676
people say they can do it, how come you say they 
can't? You didn't have much to say there. No, he

32:06.399 --> 32:06.619
did. He sat down. He sat down. He says, well, and 
then later he come along and said, Mike, you really

32:08.580 --> 32:11.903
got me, didn't you? I said, well, I didn't mean to. 
You know, you jumped straight up in the air, and you

32:13.465 --> 32:17.588
were about to jump down my throat. But anyway, 
General Davis was delighted and pleased, and when

32:17.838 --> 32:33.016
I left the 75th Maneuver Area Command to take over a 
group, the 173rd Combat Support Group. And what

32:33.636 --> 32:34.397
year was that? 1969.

32:40.965 --> 32:42.266
And organized in Beaumont. This group... What did 
you do there? I was still a full colonel. Did Davis

32:51.884 --> 32:53.546
get this job for you? No, oh no. He didn't want me to 
leave then. You were too valuable then. He really

32:59.634 --> 33:03.278
didn't want me to leave. He was very nice.

33:11.088 --> 33:12.309
You were ready for your own command. I really was 
and I always liked the command. I was staff then,

33:14.639 --> 33:32.200
and so the general out

33:14.639 --> 33:32.200
of New Orleans, Louisiana, my dad, he asked me to 
take over this group. It was a new group. Never had

33:34.102 --> 33:39.268
been in existence before, and it was being 
organized in Beaumont. He wondered if I'd take it.

33:40.249 --> 33:41.230
I said, sure. So I took this group. And got the same 
people that was in the artillery battalion. In the

33:47.561 --> 33:50.884
meantime, the artillery battalion had become a 
service supply battalion. So I took those people

33:51.265 --> 33:55.789
and we were reorganizing into a direct support 
group. So you got your old subordinates.

33:58.732 --> 33:59.834
Subordinates, right. They're really good ones, 
John. Right. Got them all back. Those of them who

34:02.837 --> 34:04.418
were still left there. Some of them quit because 
they didn't want to be in a supply unit, the

34:04.459 --> 34:08.843
artillery people. And I was I commanded that group 
for two years as full colonel. And what were your

34:17.578 --> 34:18.459
jobs? What was your function and duty there? Why 
did you have this? Why did they set this up, the

34:21.622 --> 34:24.265
173rd to begin with? Why did we need it? It was a 
service supply unit type thing. We had laundry

34:27.908 --> 34:37.498
units, we had shower bath units, graze 
registration, these services that support

34:27.908 --> 34:37.498
logistically. We had logistics.

34:41.663 --> 35:01.842
A new command for me, but I felt I could handle it 
without any problem, because the experience I had

34:41.663 --> 35:01.842
in the brigade and the experience I had in the 75th 
Maneuver Air Command, I didn't feel the supply

34:41.663 --> 35:01.842
service

34:41.663 --> 35:01.842
type organization would give me any trouble at 
all, which they did. And then I had

35:03.064 --> 35:10.911
one incident. I had a unit in Bogalusa, Louisiana. 
It was a shower unit. And the captain of that unit

35:16.479 --> 35:21.183
was Captain Beauregard, like Beauregard Parish. 
And in fact, he's related to them. OK, he had some

35:27.008 --> 35:30.752
blacks in his unit. And he also had some Ku Klux 
Klansmen in his units. And so I didn't know all of

35:36.777 --> 35:40.240
this. We were at Fort Polk, Louisiana. So I invited 
the general, uh, commanding general of Fort Polk

35:43.170 --> 35:54.885
to come down and see the first, to witness the 
opening of our shower unit. Now this Captain

35:56.446 --> 35:59.790
Beauregard set up the shower unit. And so, uh, and I 
suggested to him that he formed the company out

36:01.853 --> 36:07.780
there and have them all take showers. while the 
commanding officer, commanding general, would

36:08.283 --> 36:13.229
watch it and whatever his staff. So Beauregard 
thought it was a great idea. So sure enough, here

36:17.154 --> 36:18.876
comes all the dignitaries. And I noticed that 
there was some flurry of activity on my staff. They

36:25.705 --> 36:26.646
were talking. So I called Colonel Bell over. I 
said, Colonel Bell, what's the problem? He says,

36:34.256 --> 36:35.117
well, We're about to have a revolt in Beauregard's 
company because the

36:35.688 --> 36:44.137
white boys don't want to take a shower with the 
black boys. I said, oh. What are they going to do?

36:48.581 --> 36:49.722
They said, well, they're going to walk away. I 
said, oh, god, that's not good, is it? No. I said,

36:54.247 --> 36:55.168
OK, line them up. So they lined them all up. And the 
water's ready to pour, and the shower's off. So

37:01.574 --> 37:04.497
Captain Beauregard saw me coming. with the staff, 
the VIPs, and we got up there and we saluted. I said,

37:10.386 --> 37:19.981
Captain Beauregard, I want you, me, I said, I want 
you and me, and I want this man, this man, this man,

37:10.386 --> 37:19.981
this man. I picked out three whites and three 
blacks to take showers with me, and I started

37:20.041 --> 37:23.907
taking off my clothes.

37:27.032 --> 37:31.058
And when the white boys saw me taking off my 
clothes, they all started taking off their

37:27.032 --> 37:31.058
clothes. And so the black boys, they just went 
ahead and took the clothes. So we all took showers

37:36.349 --> 37:37.690
together. From then on, we had no more problems. 
That's a really intelligent way to resolve that. I

37:42.515 --> 37:43.656
thought that. I thought so. Did you think of that 
when you were walking out there? Well, after

37:46.619 --> 37:50.463
Captain Bell told me this, I began to think. And I 
said, you've got to do something. And I said, hell,

37:52.145 --> 37:54.628
I'll just take the bulls by the horn. Really? And 
I'll just take my clothes off and take a shower with

37:55.468 --> 37:58.952
them. And so we took a shower together, and after 
that, we had no more problems. Captain Beauregard

38:03.926 --> 38:07.873
came to me later, and he says, how did you know about 
what was going on? I said, well, I heard. And he

38:09.256 --> 38:11.840
said, well, I've been having a lot of trouble ever 
since I've been in camp. I said, well, why don't you

38:11.860 --> 38:15.968
tell me about this thing? He said, I don't think 
you'll have any more trouble. He said, I don't

38:17.370 --> 38:23.421
think I will either, because the guys that I picked 
were Klansmen. And they weren't going to tell on

38:24.751 --> 38:26.313
each other. See, what they were afraid of, they'd 
go back home to Boogaloosa, Louisiana, and they

38:26.593 --> 38:33.580
would say, hey, you took a bath with a black guy. And 
since I stepped in there and said, you come with me

38:34.681 --> 38:41.668
and take a shower, well, that made it OK, because 
they would use me as an excuse. So that kind of

38:43.310 --> 38:46.813
prevented a little racial incident there. Well, 
during this whole time, did you have any problems

38:46.834 --> 38:49.937
with the racial incidents? Not really. No 
problem. Because the South was really going under

38:51.658 --> 38:54.081
a transition. Yeah. from the 50s to the 60s and into 
the 70s, and at the same time you were commanding

38:54.350 --> 38:58.955
units. When did your units start taking blacks? 
Gee, I can't remember the date we started taking

39:03.339 --> 39:06.162
blacks. Did you back in? Actually, we were taking 
blacks all the time. Few, not many. And they were

39:13.510 --> 39:17.054
key, and they were good, and uh, they were just a 
few. And uh, uh, But I never had any trouble with

39:22.227 --> 39:26.311
blacks. I never had trouble with any of them, 
really, to tell you the truth. Did any of the units

39:28.873 --> 39:30.895
have trouble besides this one? Not that I can 
remember. None of my units ever had any trouble.

39:35.098 --> 39:37.160
Even when we went to Fort Chaffee, we never had any 
trouble. Why do you think you didn't have trouble?

39:39.562 --> 39:43.866
Because the rest of the society seemed to be having 
trouble at that time, in the mid-1960s. Well,

39:43.966 --> 39:46.649
because I guess I'm related to them. You know, I'd 
go to the black, and I'd shake his hand, put my arm

39:46.829 --> 39:51.593
around his shoulder, doing a good job, keep it up, 
you know. And the white soldier would see me and

39:54.981 --> 40:00.687
say, hell, the commander's doing it, what can I do? 
You know, be friendly with him. And so, and I looked

40:02.769 --> 40:06.673
after him. I made sure everybody was fed and good 
and had good barracks. It took me to Fort Hood one

40:13.100 --> 40:18.306
day and I had a, My unit, this direct support unit, 
sent me to Fort Hood for training. And they put us in

40:23.815 --> 40:34.406
tents on South Fort Hood next to some beautiful 
army barracks that were empty. And so the

40:36.228 --> 40:41.212
advance party went there. And so when I got there, 
Colonel Bell says, Colonel, we're going to sleep

40:42.874 --> 40:49.120
in tents. I said, what's that over there? He says, 
those are army barracks. Let's go look at them.

40:52.975 --> 40:54.837
Well, where are they? Hell, they were good army 
barracks. Clean, nice. I said, why can't we live in

40:59.201 --> 41:00.862
here? He says, we can't do it. I said, where the hell 
we came? So I went to the corps commander,

41:04.425 --> 41:11.672
three-star general named General Powell, Bev 
Powell, regular army corps commander. I said,

41:11.692 --> 41:16.196
General Powell, I says, you've got some regular 
army barracks out there. They're not being used.

41:19.627 --> 41:23.852
active army barracks, and yet you put us in tents, 
sleeping on the dirt floor.

41:26.896 --> 41:29.159
I said, well, come on, I'll show you. We took a ride. 
He cussed. No, hell no. Next thing I knew, we were in

41:34.726 --> 41:37.350
those barracks. And so he called me in, and we 
became very good friends throughout the years.

41:45.881 --> 41:47.743
And he thanked me. You see, this is part of this. Why 
was this? Because you were a reservist?

41:53.163 --> 41:53.664
Reservist. This is part of what we were talking 
about. Part about the active establishment

41:56.228 --> 41:59.853
resenting the reservists coming in there. What we 
could do in two weeks, they couldn't do in six

42:01.435 --> 42:07.183
months, and we'd do a good job. Of course, we had 
quality people, just like that architect and that

42:07.263 --> 42:13.372
engineer and controller I was telling you about. 
We had tremendous people, and they could do it. So

42:17.710 --> 42:29.321
after that, when we went back the next year, they 
didn't have any spaces on post, so they put us in

42:17.710 --> 42:29.321
motels. No kidding? Oh, yeah. They didn't put you 
in tents? They put you in a motel? Holiday Inn. They

42:34.666 --> 42:36.347
didn't want to go through. They didn't want to have 
General Powell come. That's a royal treatment.

42:38.670 --> 42:39.070
That's right. They didn't want General Powell 
coming down and blowing down their neck anymore. I

42:41.733 --> 42:44.455
think he got rid of a couple of people, really. He 
told me he wanted to. And he was good to me. He had

42:47.230 --> 42:52.895
visitors from Washington, Pentagon come visit 
him at home. He invited me over for dinner a couple

42:53.596 --> 42:56.518
of times to eat with us. It was nice. I got along good 
with him. And I would tell him about the Reserves.

43:01.923 --> 43:04.105
And I didn't mention any words. Down in the field, 
the active Army people don't help us. I don't know.

43:10.190 --> 43:11.211
Maybe I helped, maybe I didn't. I don't know. Word 
got back to Pentagon. Because these were three and

43:13.653 --> 43:15.255
four star generals. Sure. And here I was just a 
colonel. And I always maintained my position with

43:18.752 --> 43:23.116
them. I never got smart aleck with them at all. And, 
you know, they found out I played basketball at

43:25.898 --> 43:28.961
A&M. Then they found out I was a handball champion. 
In fact, General Powell lined up handball game

43:31.063 --> 43:33.325
with me. Oh, really? Oh, sure. He wanted me to beat 
some people on the post. He did, yeah. And I did. Oh,

43:39.510 --> 43:40.431
yeah. Chaplain. He was a colonel chaplain. And the 
other guy was a... Brigadier General, and he said,

43:45.072 --> 43:47.355
I want you to beat on him. They think they're smart. 
So I did. I played handball. I just beat him. He

43:52.982 --> 43:53.583
liked that. Anyway. What about your last 
assignment then? That's about it. You're talking

44:00.471 --> 44:01.933
about the Quartermaster Patrol? We've got to go 
there now. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

44:04.897 --> 44:06.399
That's your last assignment. I was the commander 
of this direct support group in Beaumont. I'm

44:10.624 --> 44:12.126
sitting in my office.

44:14.890 --> 44:18.073
I went to the Army one morning, about 10.30, and the 
phone rings. And it's the Army commander, the

44:20.155 --> 44:26.802
Deputy Army commander, General Franklin. 
Colonel Koganos? Yes, sir. It's General

44:29.285 --> 44:29.905
Franklin. Yes, sir. You've been selected to take 
the Brigadier General slot in Albuquerque, New

44:32.228 --> 44:38.134
Mexico. I said, well, what is this? He says, 
there's a Brigadier General slot opening, the

44:40.256 --> 44:44.020
commander is retired, and you have been selected 
to assume that position. Would you like to have it?

44:51.308 --> 44:54.411
That means going from Beaumont, Texas to 
Albuquerque, New Mexico. I said, yes, sir. I'd be

44:56.754 --> 44:57.574
glad to have it. He said, OK. And you never thought 
about this before? You never had any word or any

45:00.878 --> 45:05.722
hint or anything? I knew the job was open in Mexico, 
but it didn't Excite me to try to see what it was all

45:14.813 --> 45:18.478
about. And so I went to General Frank and said, you 
better come see me. We're at your convenience. So I

45:28.892 --> 45:30.975
said, well, it'd be several days. Of course, I was 
tied up in my business. He said, well, come on up

45:32.677 --> 45:34.059
here. And then we set a date up. I remember it was 
Tuesday morning, about 10 o'clock. So I took off

45:37.784 --> 45:39.006
for San Antonio. And he told me, he said, now, it's a 
very dear General Slott. You're a Texan. You're

45:44.199 --> 45:45.160
going to New Mexico. He says, I asked him the same 
thing, Terry. I said, why did you select me, Joe

45:49.704 --> 45:53.628
Franklin? He says, because you had the best 
record. And you've come highly recommended to us

45:57.632 --> 46:04.079
from other sources that we sought 
recommendation. Your name popped up because of

46:04.099 --> 46:06.041
your record. And once it popped up, we began to look 
into it. And we checked your background and

46:10.365 --> 46:13.288
everything. You were the man for the job. So I went 
on up there. I flew up there on the weekend and took

46:18.517 --> 46:20.620
over command. Next thing I knew, I was being 
investigated by Senator Montoya. No kidding? Oh,

46:27.387 --> 46:27.767
yeah. You remember this Montoya on Watergate? He 
was his ranking senior in New Mexico. He wanted to

46:32.593 --> 46:36.097
know why a Texan would take over a New Mexico unit. 
That's what his reason was. Why was a Texan? In

46:39.580 --> 46:41.803
other words, he wanted somebody from New Mexico to 
take it over. Oh, sure. Take it over. and

46:43.458 --> 46:47.968
Department of the Army, and Franklin had 
forewarned me that they'd probably get some

46:43.458 --> 46:47.968
static. Now, I didn't get involved with Senator 
Montoya myself, because he dealt with the Army.

46:53.581 --> 46:55.645
The Army says, don't worry about it. It says, we've 
got your record.
