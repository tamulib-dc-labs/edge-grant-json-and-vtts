WEBVTT

00:01.972 --> 00:05.155
in the home of Bill Anderson in Corpus Christi. 
Bill is the former director of planning in Corpus

00:06.056 --> 00:10.161
Christi. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to 
Bill, and he will tell us about the history of

00:11.222 --> 00:20.692
planning in Corpus Christi. I think the 
appropriate place to start is with the early

00:22.373 --> 00:28.700
promotion of the city. And it was speculative. It 
was done by a man by the name of Ropes that came from

00:32.482 --> 00:37.109
New York. He had great visions that this would be 
the Venice of the United States, Venice of the Gulf

00:39.072 --> 00:47.364
Coast. He spent a great deal of money digging a 
channel. He built a big hotel. He laid out a large

00:56.537 --> 01:01.965
subdivision that fixed the pattern of the streets 
up to this time for a large portion of the city. And

01:07.984 --> 01:09.846
in general, it was a very good plan.

01:15.213 --> 01:21.941
During the Depression in 1908 or thereabout, it 
failed. And for a long time, the city was only a

01:23.643 --> 01:27.728
resort center. And in 1926, A ship channel was 
built, and a harbor was located here, which

01:32.270 --> 01:40.100
assured the industrial development of the area. 
And about the same time, oil was discovered and

01:41.822 --> 01:49.671
gas. And shortly after, several industrial 
plants were built that were based largely on the

01:51.433 --> 02:01.045
availability of cheap natural gas.

02:05.572 --> 02:30.238
The next big event that took, well, during the 
Depression,

02:05.572 --> 02:30.238
the state planning officer, Major Wood, visited 
Corpus Christi and encouraged the city to, this

02:05.572 --> 02:30.238
was in 1935 or thereabouts, encouraged the city to 
enact a zoning ordinance and a subdivision

02:31.045 --> 02:38.655
ordinance. And to do so, encouraged the

02:40.017 --> 02:53.274
formation of an informal planning commission, 
citizens commission. He loaned and gave some

02:55.597 --> 02:59.702
assistance to the citizens commission. And they 
formulated a

03:01.184 --> 03:06.871
zoning ordinance. Now, this zoning ordinance was 
a good thing, but it was not based on scientific

03:08.513 --> 03:19.005
analysis of the problems or land use. There was no 
comprehensive plan. There was no comprehensive

03:21.268 --> 03:22.750
plan. And there was no comprehensive study of land 
use. These citizens, who were very highly

03:28.032 --> 03:43.890
respected citizens on the Planning Commission 
and knew the city pretty well at that time, used

03:28.032 --> 03:43.890
their best judgment in laying out the zoning 
districts.

03:44.150 --> 03:46.893
Shortly after, they enacted a subdivision 
ordinance.

03:52.219 --> 03:57.145
Along about this time, the National Resources 
Planning Board offered the city a study called a

03:58.981 --> 04:04.688
sketch plan.

04:07.311 --> 04:16.842
And I don't know exactly how it got started, but 
there were several architects, most of them

04:07.311 --> 04:16.842
graduates of Texas A&M.

04:19.605 --> 04:21.807
One of the leaders was Richard Colley. How does he 
spell that name? C-O-L-L-E-Y.

04:28.242 --> 04:30.865
a very capable and competent architect. And there 
were some other architects involved. And Sam

04:37.554 --> 04:43.162
Zisman evidently was an advisor to this group. 
They got together and had some citizens'

04:45.385 --> 04:48.409
committees. And they made some very rough 
sketches that kind of designated areas. suitable

04:59.410 --> 05:06.799
for various purposes, sketchy type drawings.

05:10.383 --> 05:21.817
Nothing really came of this, but it did serve to 
stimulate some interest among the citizens of the

05:10.383 --> 05:21.817
city.

05:25.161 --> 05:29.046
I don't believe many of the top leaders got 
involved. But there were quite a few citizens that

05:29.988 --> 05:32.531
were in it.

05:36.695 --> 05:45.905
League of Women Voters, and Garden Club people, 
and architects,

05:36.695 --> 05:45.905
and other groups.

05:50.130 --> 05:55.275
Sam Zussman was assigned here out of the National? 
I think he was. I think he was signed here. And Bob

06:00.464 --> 06:06.309
Mitchell from the National Resources Board, I 
think, was here one time. But I think Zisman was

06:07.690 --> 06:12.535
kind of the guidance to the local people. And 
nothing came, really, of this sketch plan. Is that

06:19.621 --> 06:22.504
the Robert Mitchell that taught at the University 
of Pennsylvania? Yeah. I studied him. He was a

06:25.006 --> 06:28.489
fraternity brother of mine at University of 
Illinois Alpha Rho Chi. Really? I studied under

06:29.860 --> 06:32.203
him at Penn. Yeah, I was now for up there in 
Illinois. Well, as I said, nothing really came

06:35.447 --> 06:52.769
specific from this sketch plan, except it served a 
good educational media, which I think was one of

06:35.447 --> 06:52.769
the purposes that it had. Well, as I understand it, 
this was one of the first federal attempts at what

06:58.312 --> 07:03.199
might be called a demonstration, a national 
demonstration. Yeah, this was selected as one of

07:03.219 --> 07:06.664
the cities for the demonstration. There weren't 
many. No, there were only five or six, I think. I

07:09.549 --> 07:10.991
believe so, during the Depression era. Yeah, 
there were only five or six of them. And this was one

07:12.613 --> 07:13.414
of them. And I think it was very worth, I think it was 
worthwhile.

07:22.828 --> 07:25.032
Now, the next important. It was the only one in 
Texas. Yeah. The only one in Texas. I think the

07:31.304 --> 07:54.407
next,

07:31.304 --> 07:54.407
well, along about 19,

07:31.304 --> 07:54.407
oh, long about this time, 38 or 39, the government 
decided to establish a naval air training station

07:31.304 --> 07:54.407
here in Corpus Christi. And they bought a large 
tract of land

07:55.973 --> 08:08.810
south of the city and built a naval training 
station, a naval air training station. And it

08:10.853 --> 08:16.561
eventually became one of the largest ones in the 
country, or one of the largest in the world. They

08:17.782 --> 08:22.909
had flying boats, and they had a propeller 
aircraft, and they had a lot of auxiliary fields.

08:28.890 --> 08:44.728
Also, at Ward Island, which is a little isolated 
tract of land south of the city, they had a radar

08:28.890 --> 08:44.728
training station, which was a super secret 
installation. People in the town didn't really

08:46.209 --> 08:53.217
know what it was, but there were a lot of people 
assigned here, and there was a lot of A lot of

08:53.973 --> 08:59.039
civilian employees and a lot of naval employees 
here. And the city grew. But there was very poor

09:03.464 --> 09:05.527
housing, and they couldn't. They had to resort to 
the old tourist courts for the people that

09:06.988 --> 09:16.900
accompanied the military and civilians. And it 
resulted in a lot of slummy property,

09:18.302 --> 09:23.828
particularly on Corpus Christi Beach.

09:27.790 --> 09:37.404
Right at the end of the war, then, a political event 
took place, which was very significant. Prior to

09:39.046 --> 09:45.155
this time, the city had a commission form of 
government, and it was a very poor one. Inherited

09:45.896 --> 09:47.899
from Galveston, I have no doubt. Well, I don't know 
how long they had it, but they had it for some time,

09:47.919 --> 09:55.570
and it was...

09:56.917 --> 10:02.604
a very unwholesome thing, particularly with the 
high proportion of Mexican-Americans we had. The

10:02.664 --> 10:15.279
commissioners

10:02.664 --> 10:15.279
used their position to control the votes of the 
Mexican-Americans. And the Mexican-Americans

10:16.780 --> 10:23.328
at that time were a very uneducated group. They 
were primarily cotton pickers. They lived in a

10:27.713 --> 10:38.565
section of the city that was a very slum section 
west of the city, where a good deal of it was outside

10:27.713 --> 10:38.565
the city. No sewers, no water, no drainage. It was 
just a horrible situation. We had a Negro section

10:46.333 --> 10:51.398
that was pretty well segregated over on the north 
side. And this contained a great deal of

10:52.580 --> 10:55.763
substandard housing. and segregated schools.

11:02.020 --> 11:27.285
At this time, a group of citizens, realizing that 
Corpus Christi was on the go and would continue to

11:02.020 --> 11:27.285
grow because

11:02.020 --> 11:27.285
of the oil activity and increasing industrial 
activity that was caused by the ship channel, that

11:27.721 --> 11:33.369
this city was destined to grow and grow fast. The 
leading citizens got together. They were heads of

11:37.955 --> 11:45.626
the industries, and they were all top-notch 
people. And they represented what later became

11:47.488 --> 11:57.222
called the power structure.

11:58.484 --> 12:18.588
They established

11:58.484 --> 12:18.588
the city manager form of government in the city 
through the leadership of this group. Then

12:20.970 --> 12:26.517
they got some of these people to serve on the city 
council, one of which was Robert Wilson, the

12:28.133 --> 12:38.482
brother of Charles E. Wilson, who was president of 
General Motors. And people of that caliber were on

12:39.803 --> 12:47.109
the city council,

12:39.803 --> 12:47.109
bankers.

12:49.771 --> 12:57.398
Also, one of the leading oil men in the city was made 
president of the Chamber of Commerce, Guy Warren.

12:59.723 --> 13:06.991
And together, they conceived the idea of a 
citizen's group called the Area Development

12:59.723 --> 13:06.991
Committee.

13:09.794 --> 13:29.055
And on this Area Development Committee, they had 
some 30

13:09.794 --> 13:29.055
people, 25

13:09.794 --> 13:29.055
people, that were all leaders, that were top 
owners of the businesses, the biggest

13:30.520 --> 13:31.461
businesses. They were

13:33.644 --> 13:47.880
presidents of the banks,

13:33.644 --> 13:47.880
managers of the industries, top oil men that owned 
their companies. And there was around 25 of them.

13:53.687 --> 13:57.692
And they conceived this idea of a citizens 
committee to guide the growth and development of

13:58.955 --> 14:01.398
the city.

14:05.703 --> 14:10.690
They realized that they were... About what year 
was that? This was in about 1945. Right after the

14:12.692 --> 14:15.315
war. Right after the war. About 1945.

14:23.986 --> 14:24.387
And 46. Well, they realized that...

14:31.777 --> 14:41.126
They were businessmen, and they didn't know 
anything about the mechanics of government and

14:31.777 --> 14:41.126
the details of government. And they would need 
some help. So they formed a second committee

14:42.207 --> 14:48.413
called a coordination committee. And on that 
committee, they had all the political leaders,

14:50.035 --> 15:00.805
like the county judge, the mayor, the 
superintendent of schools, and the district

15:01.814 --> 15:15.686
engineer of the highway department, and others, 
including the director of the Chamber of

15:01.814 --> 15:15.686
Commerce, or the executive director. And they had 
the president of the Citizens Council, the Nueces

15:17.668 --> 15:26.015
Navigation District, Water Supply District, and 
all of the political leaders. Well, these were the

15:27.737 --> 15:31.720
ones that were asked to do something about the 
guiding of the growth of the city. In turn, this

15:38.339 --> 15:44.247
group got together and decided that they needed 
some technical assistance. So they then

15:46.550 --> 15:52.517
appointed what was known as a subcommittee. And on 
this subcommittee, they had one, two, three,

15:54.139 --> 16:01.048
four, five engineers.

16:03.509 --> 16:09.355
two lawyers

16:03.509 --> 16:09.355
and the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce.

16:12.118 --> 16:14.520
They gave this group an assignment. They said, now 
here's what we want to do, now you tell us how to do

16:16.342 --> 16:19.105
it.

16:23.229 --> 16:32.959
So this group got together and they wrote to ASPO, 
American Institute of Planners, American

16:23.229 --> 16:32.959
Society of Civil Engineers, and a number of other 
groups, United States Chamber of Commerce, and

16:34.137 --> 16:45.328
told them what we wanted to do and asked them to tell 
us who could do it and tell us some names, give us

16:34.137 --> 16:45.328
some names of people. So we got all these names, and 
we got suggestions of how to go about it. So the next

16:55.639 --> 16:59.522
thing was to interview these people. So we had 14 of 
the top firms in the United States. come to Corpus

17:04.883 --> 17:17.684
Christi and look the situation over and tell us how 
they would approach the problem or what they

17:04.883 --> 17:17.684
thought ought to be in a plan. Was

17:17.744 --> 17:26.739
there any money put up for this effort? Well, I'll 
get to that. I think most of the consultants came in

17:30.533 --> 17:35.078
here at their own expense. Up to this time, there 
was very little money in it. Now,

17:39.944 --> 17:59.848
this committee reported back through channels 
what we needed and what

17:39.944 --> 17:59.848
suggested a program. And we told them it was going 
to cost them some money.

18:07.991 --> 18:15.101
Now, this committee, the Area Development 
Committee, decided to assess their members. And

18:17.444 --> 18:25.977
they assessed their members at the rate, each 
time, about $1,000 apiece. And they could afford

18:25.997 --> 18:30.443
it because they were the power structure and 
leading citizens. And after

18:32.093 --> 18:48.334
interviewing all these people, the firm that 
stood out the most was the firm of Harlan

18:32.093 --> 18:48.334
Bartholomew and Associates. They seemed to have 
the most practical approach and the one that

18:49.836 --> 18:58.067
seemed to satisfy the members of the committee the 
most. had placed me in an awkward position because

18:59.583 --> 19:07.012
prior to coming to Corpus Christi, I had been 
employed by that firm. I asked to be declared

19:08.494 --> 19:15.743
ineligible to participate because of my 
connection.

19:18.987 --> 19:24.073
But the rest of the committee went on, and they did 
select the Bartholomew firm. Well, Bill, when did

19:26.677 --> 19:29.320
you get to Corpus Christi? I came in 1946 with the 
reform government. Now, I was the second city

19:35.137 --> 19:36.758
planner. They had a city council prior to Robert 
Wilson that was not acceptable, and they were

19:39.140 --> 19:51.952
recalled. But they had employed a building 
inspector Austin as their planner. And he was only

20:04.751 --> 20:15.261
here for about

20:04.751 --> 20:15.261
nine months. And with the

20:16.863 --> 20:22.108
recall movement. You don't remember his name. 
Yeah, I do. I'll think of it in a minute. OK. With the

20:30.758 --> 20:36.106
recall movement, he didn't want to stay on with the 
city government. He thought that if the city

20:36.366 --> 20:43.597
government was that bad, he didn't want to be on it, 
on the staff. So he resigned. So then when the new

20:46.461 --> 20:59.500
city council, Robert Wilson, came in, they went 
about contacting ASPO and American Society of

20:46.461 --> 20:59.500
Civil Engineers and other people. United States 
Chamber of Commerce for suggestions for a

21:00.509 --> 21:05.697
planner. I was one of three that was interviewed. 
They paid my expenses down here from New Jersey.

21:20.421 --> 21:22.405
You were living in New Jersey then? I was living in 
Newark working on a comprehensive plan with for

21:26.463 --> 21:28.986
the city of Newark was Bartholomew. Ah, yes. 
That's where he started his practice, was in

21:29.366 --> 21:33.331
Newark. Yeah, and I have a copy of their first 
comprehensive plan there. Ah.

21:41.120 --> 21:41.380
Well. Do you know the other two that were 
interviewed? Or does it matter?

21:50.911 --> 21:54.495
One guy, he went with the National Resources 
Planning Board. Pretty good boy. Uh-huh. The

21:56.956 --> 22:00.640
other one I don't remember. Matter

22:00.660 --> 22:23.605
of fact, they had a little job selling me to come 
because I had gotten on a plane with a naval officer

22:00.660 --> 22:23.605
that had apparently didn't like Corpus Christi 
and gave me a pretty good unselling. But before the

22:25.186 --> 22:26.828
day was over, of my interview,

22:27.702 --> 22:38.031
they convinced me that there was a great challenge 
here and that they wanted me. They paid my expenses

22:39.433 --> 22:40.914
down here. One of the department store owners 
brought me down.

22:49.742 --> 22:52.324
I didn't decide for a week, but they called me every 
day. And then I finally decided to come got

22:57.503 --> 23:04.453
permission to be released by Bartholomew.

23:04.473 --> 23:20.495
And this is the reason that I declared myself 
disqualified to participate in the selection of a

23:04.473 --> 23:20.495
firm because I didn't want my association to 
affect it. Well, Bartholomew started out on the

23:22.739 --> 23:25.182
plans. It was about a $100,000 contract. Big money 
in those days. And that was a pretty good sized

23:31.606 --> 23:35.974
contract for it. But considering what was 
involved in it, I don't think it was too much.

23:44.347 --> 23:52.080
Because Bartholomew went outside of his firm and 
employed a number of other consultants. One of the

23:53.731 --> 23:57.055
big problems, we had three major problems. One was 
a water supply.

24:02.903 --> 24:13.237
One was the problem of the

24:02.903 --> 24:13.237
constricting bridge that we had at the entrance to 
the channel. It restricted the flow of marine

24:14.438 --> 24:19.665
traffic. It was a bottleneck for for both railroad 
and vehicular traffic. So Bartholomew went

24:26.024 --> 24:37.200
outside of his firm and got the most qualified 
engineers in each of these fields that he could

24:26.024 --> 24:37.200
find. He got W.W. Horner, who was then president of 
the American Society of Civil Engineers, as his

24:39.183 --> 24:49.557
engineer advisor on the water supply and the 
airport. He got Sverdrup and Parcell, one of the

24:51.747 --> 25:01.999
top bridge engineers in the United States, and 
railroad engineers on the problem of the bridge.

25:02.780 --> 25:06.624
No, Sverdrup, that's S-V-E-R-D-R-U-P? Yes, 
Sverdrup and Parcell. And Parcell. Yeah, you can

25:10.068 --> 25:15.214
see their ad in the paper. Well, Bartholomew went 
about a very thorough study. about three years to

25:22.274 --> 25:23.896
complete it. He started in 1950 and finished it in 
1953. Now his technique, of course, is to take each

25:31.084 --> 25:46.842
subject and

25:31.084 --> 25:46.842
write a very thorough treatise on it, as much as 
time and funds would permit. And he got out

25:48.023 --> 25:51.387
separate reports on each subject. and including 
in these subjects were

25:52.025 --> 26:21.677
economic

25:52.025 --> 26:21.677
background, population, land use, housing, 
streets and highways, transportation,

25:52.025 --> 26:21.677
transit,

26:24.425 --> 26:33.155
parking, schools and parks, public buildings, 
water supply, storm drainage, public works, and

26:24.425 --> 26:33.155
administration. Now, each of these subjects had a 
separate and pretty good sized report, which were

26:34.657 --> 26:53.419
circulated to an extensive citizens committee 
that included several hundred citizens that were

26:54.040 --> 26:56.524
appointed by the Area Development Committee.

27:00.750 --> 27:19.318
And they were,

27:00.750 --> 27:19.318
they were presumably the leading citizens on the 
various subjects that they were interested in,

27:00.750 --> 27:19.318
that knew and had some knowledge. So immediately, 
A big citizen support was engendered.

27:31.932 --> 27:34.315
And all these were leaders, too. So each one of 
these reports was very thoroughly examined,

27:36.297 --> 27:44.927
several of them rewritten.

27:47.891 --> 27:53.157
And finally, they were in such a shape that all the 
citizens were satisfied. They were then

27:59.828 --> 28:04.715
submitted to the Area Development Committee, 
which eventually approved them. And then they

28:07.198 --> 28:17.292
authorized the publication of the summary, which 
is this volume here, which was called the

28:07.198 --> 28:17.292
Comprehensive Plan. Now, of course, anybody can 
make a plan. Any planner can make a plan. He can

28:27.381 --> 28:35.570
arrange the streets and the parks in

28:27.381 --> 28:35.570
good order. But it's quite another thing to also

28:36.731 --> 28:51.848
plan to implement it and figure out how to pay for it 
and keep it within scale, the ability of the

28:36.731 --> 28:51.848
community to pay for it. And this was part of the 
assignment. And one of the reasons that the plan

28:54.069 --> 29:01.681
was very successful was

28:54.069 --> 29:01.681
this phase of it. They not only suggested what they 
needed, but how they could pay for it.

29:12.718 --> 29:20.130
For instance, when the bridge was built, and we 
call it the Railroad Relocation Project, or the

29:21.140 --> 29:29.909
The elimination of the Bascule Bridge bottleneck 
is what was known locally, and we dubbed it the

29:21.140 --> 29:29.909
Bascule Bottleneck Project.

29:32.912 --> 29:39.119
We got involved there with the federal government 
through the Truman Hobbs Act. It took some

29:40.260 --> 29:49.510
research to find out that there was funds 
available for the relocation of a bridge due to the

29:40.260 --> 29:49.510
needs of navigation. We got the Highway 
Department involved for building the high

29:51.329 --> 29:55.575
bridge. And so altogether, we had the federal 
government

29:57.699 --> 30:10.718
primarily on the Truman Hobbs and the relocation 
of the ship channel. That's a relocation of the

30:12.521 --> 30:14.043
bridge. We had the Highway Department on the high 
bridge and the connections to it. which

30:21.670 --> 30:25.776
eventually expanded into a freeway system for the 
city. We had the city and the county and the

30:27.658 --> 30:37.291
navigation district involved, each with a share 
in the cost of it. And it was divided according to

30:39.414 --> 30:45.583
their legal authority to do certain phases of 
this. So we had a very complicated formula on the

30:46.905 --> 30:50.209
financing of it. But we knew before we started we 
could finance it. We also had four railroads that

30:55.187 --> 31:00.913
were competing railroads. And they weren't 
speaking to each other. And we had to get their

31:05.439 --> 31:10.825
total cooperation in order to make this work.

31:15.110 --> 31:18.013
I'm going back now to one other thing. In this area 
development committee, We had the

31:23.129 --> 31:29.801
president of the Chamber of Commerce I mentioned 
was Guy Warren. And he had the good sense to appoint

31:31.244 --> 31:38.978
the president of the power company.
