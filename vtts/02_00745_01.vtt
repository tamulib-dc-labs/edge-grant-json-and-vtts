WEBVTT

00:04.486 --> 00:12.698
Did you have any favorite teachers when you were at 
A&M?

00:12.718 --> 00:16.383
Oh, I remember some of them. Which ones can you 
remember?

00:23.553 --> 00:30.122
Well, I didn't have any favorites among the 
chemistry department, because the biggest

00:23.553 --> 00:30.122
percentage of them busted chemistry.

00:32.431 --> 00:35.555
I remember I went and talked to Dr. Brazell about 
it. I said, now, Dr. Brazell, I'm no top A student,

00:35.575 --> 00:49.715
but I says, I can name you some students here who 
never busted a course till they got in the

00:35.575 --> 00:49.715
chemistry

00:35.575 --> 00:49.715
department. But we had a lot of friends. It was good 
cooperation between the faculty and the

00:52.519 --> 00:55.823
students. As a overall, you would say you found the 
faculty pretty helpful to you then? Oh yeah, they

01:00.573 --> 01:02.956
were, they were, they were swell fellows. We liked 
them all. Well, I said we'd do it. I guess the

01:05.960 --> 01:12.830
chemistry professor was all right, but their 
department wasn't very much in favor. Earlier

01:14.612 --> 01:17.996
today when we were at lunch, you mentioned a couple 
of faculty members. I think you mentioned Dr.

01:18.016 --> 01:22.182
Francis. Dr. Francis was head of the veterinary 
department. But you didn't have any classes under

01:24.889 --> 01:26.410
him? Yes, I had classes under him, yes. Well, I was 
wondering, since you were in agronomy, according

01:28.512 --> 01:33.056
to the 17th. Yes, but the agronomy course did have a 
course in two veterinary courses in the agronomy.

01:38.861 --> 01:47.548
Dr. Marsteller, he was also

01:38.861 --> 01:47.548
in the veterinary. He was head of that school for a 
while. He succeeded Dr. Francis. Okay.

01:56.865 --> 02:02.091
What did the students overall think about the 
administration? And I guess maybe I better make a

02:03.192 --> 02:13.623
dual role of administration because you had the 
president who ran the academic side and you had the

02:03.192 --> 02:13.623
commandant who kind of controlled the military. 
Known as the bull. The bull, right. Did the

02:17.246 --> 02:22.712
students feel favorably towards both of those 
people or? Oh, I think so. Of course, they kind of

02:25.291 --> 02:37.704
feared the military because they were always so 
strong about discipline.

02:37.784 --> 02:42.269
Then

02:37.784 --> 02:42.269
what about Dr. Bazell? You mentioned earlier that 
you talked to him about the chemistry. He was very,

02:45.913 --> 02:51.639
very fine, very well liked, very popular among the 
boys. Everybody liked him. He knew a lot of them by

02:53.759 --> 02:55.261
name.

02:58.765 --> 03:00.047
I knew him very intimately. Ms. Brazell used to 
entertain some of my dance dates. Girls would come

03:04.953 --> 03:09.259
down and I was in his home a good many times. I 
believe something I read indicated he taught a

03:09.279 --> 03:14.806
Sunday school class for a good long while while he 
was president. I expect he did. He was a very

03:16.248 --> 03:20.914
consecrated Christian gentleman.

03:24.083 --> 03:32.718
Can you think of any new traditions which were 
started while you were a student? I know the

03:33.018 --> 03:49.146
bonfire precedes you and several other things 
which were still being done today were being done

03:33.018 --> 03:49.146
before you came, but one of the things that's very 
hard for us to pin down is when did something start?

03:49.733 --> 03:53.861
Can you think of anything that was started during 
the four years you were there?

03:57.528 --> 04:01.977
I don't recall.

04:01.997 --> 04:11.455
Some of the gills that the student body used today 
were started during my Saw the Texas Longhorns on.

04:17.980 --> 04:19.762
Saw the Varsity Horns on. Saw the Varsity Horns on 
the starter. Chickaroo rim, Chickaroo rim.

04:23.866 --> 04:26.509
Rough, tough, still rough Texas A&M. That was one 
of the starters there. I think they still use them.

04:34.337 --> 04:34.898
I believe so, yes. Freshman, everybody went to the 
ball games. If you didn't play, just especially

04:38.902 --> 04:41.425
freshman. He didn't go to the athletic events. He 
just got his butt patted. Did now, of course, they

04:50.658 --> 04:53.122
stand during the ball game. Did you stand then or 
did you sit down? Yeah, that was the 12th man. Yeah,

04:59.350 --> 05:03.716
they'd stand.

05:03.736 --> 05:12.188
I think the spirit was, I don't know anything about 
the spirit, the core spirit, now. I would believe

05:12.590 --> 05:22.543
it would be better then than it

05:12.590 --> 05:22.543
is now. Well then it was somewhat of a unanimous 
thing and now it's an optional. That's right. It

05:30.393 --> 05:33.457
was very unpatriotic not to be that. I remember a 
couple of years after I graduated, to give you an

05:33.477 --> 05:38.243
example of how the Corps thought,

05:41.564 --> 05:52.635
I drove in, me and my wife drove into the campus 
about 11 o'clock one morning, Thanksgiving

05:41.564 --> 05:52.635
morning, for the Thanksgiving game against the 
university. And I stopped my car at the gate and I

05:54.597 --> 06:02.906
saw a freshman standing off to one side over there 
and I said, wait, I believe I'll see how the game's

05:54.597 --> 06:02.906
coming out. Well, I said, what does he know about 
it? I said, well, I just want to talk to one of these

06:06.029 --> 06:09.593
freshmen. So I went over there and I said, young 
man, how's the game coming out? Well, he looked

06:16.097 --> 06:17.618
kind of far off. I said, well, I just finished it two 
or three years ago, and if I knew how you boys felt

06:19.360 --> 06:28.069
about this game today, I'd know how it was coming 
out. And the kid was teed up. He come in, he's

06:30.552 --> 06:33.195
crying, standing there by himself. He says, we're 
going to beat those SOBs just to show as we play this

06:35.337 --> 06:39.702
afternoon. He said, I haven't slept on the campus 
for three nights. He said, they run me out every

06:44.743 --> 06:46.205
night. I said, we're going to win. So I got back to 
the car. I told my wife, I said, well, we're going to

06:52.953 --> 06:55.316
win the ball game. She said, is he a prophet? I said, 
no, I just got the feeling of the Corps.

07:01.363 --> 07:03.766
And they used to win then. And you can check it, but I 
think

07:11.930 --> 07:23.603
14, 15, and 16 that

07:11.930 --> 07:23.603
our football team wasn't scored

07:11.930 --> 07:23.603
on. You can check that and see. I don't want you to 
go. Well, let's see. I believe something we talked

07:26.787 --> 07:32.894
about earlier, the branding of the university 
steer. I believe the university's intention to

07:33.855 --> 07:41.363
brand it with the 16 score uh would have indicated 
we were scored on in 16. maybe so i don't know what he

07:41.647 --> 08:09.190
is i have a list of the scores but

07:41.647 --> 08:09.190
uh while we're talking about that branding of the 
steer since since uh that branding was done during

07:41.647 --> 08:09.190
17

07:41.647 --> 08:09.190
when when you were a senior what can you tell us 
about that incident Before I set in on the planning

08:09.558 --> 08:13.622
of it, I wasn't among the five that went over there. 
You have in the annual who went. The branding team,

08:16.085 --> 08:18.948
they called it. And I set in on the planning of it and 
what we were going to do. And I saw them that night

08:23.593 --> 08:25.435
when they got back. They said the job had been done. 
What prompted them to go ahead and brand the steer?

08:35.786 --> 08:38.569
Well, Lutcher Stark, who's a very wealthy man, a 
university alumnus. He gave the university, he

08:43.124 --> 08:53.079
was an alumnus down in Beaumont area, Fort Arthur 
area. He gave them a very beautiful steel. It was

08:55.643 --> 08:59.589
orange and white steel with long horns. And so he 
was, I guess you'd call him the mascot. And between

09:04.997 --> 09:07.341
halves, Two university cowboys would have their 
steer on rope, bring them out, and circle them

09:08.030 --> 09:17.200
around. So they were supposed to beat us that year, 
but we did win 13 to nothing. I don't know whose idea

09:26.930 --> 09:27.951
it was. I think it was a very good one. Somebody 
decided to just go in and brand that darn steer. But

09:34.358 --> 09:35.860
our score went up. And he never did appear in public 
after that. I understood that they gave him to one

09:42.899 --> 09:56.536
of the charity institutions

09:42.899 --> 09:56.536
over in Austin, butchered him. Made beef out of 
him. We have a clipping in the archives that

09:57.946 --> 10:12.553
indicated that they butchered him and had a 
banquet at which representatives from both

09:57.946 --> 10:12.553
schools were invited and they supposedly divided 
the hide between the two schools. I didn't hear

10:12.813 --> 10:13.394
that. But we can't... prove that. There was a 
clipping and it's pasted on the back of one of the

10:17.385 --> 10:24.374
pictures we have of the branded steer. A student by 
the name of Atkinson, he was kind of an amateur

10:24.594 --> 10:32.384
photographer around there. He went over there 
with them and took a picture of the steer. And so

10:36.109 --> 10:44.220
they took his camera away from him over there on the 
scene, but he was sharp enough to admit it, as soon

10:44.487 --> 10:52.956
as he snapped the steer, he took the film out of his 
car, out of his camera, and put them in his pocket.

10:52.976 --> 10:59.603
And the university boys rushed down there on him 
and caused quite a bit of fight. And they took this

10:59.623 --> 11:03.947
boy's camera and broke it up on the pavement. But he 
had the film in his pocket. So he came back and made

11:06.750 --> 11:13.397
an enlargement of it, eight and a half by 11 or 
something of the steer. Sold them at 25 cents a

11:14.525 --> 11:18.831
piece, and I think everybody down there bought 
them. Well, I've seen several. He probably made

11:19.893 --> 11:23.197
out pretty well on them. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he charged 
them too much a piece. That was the most popular

11:26.562 --> 11:39.621
picture around there, I'm sure, except another 
one that he sold, that picture of September Morn,

11:26.562 --> 11:39.621
the girl in the water. We

11:40.023 --> 12:01.073
talked earlier at lunch today about the taking

11:40.023 --> 12:01.073
of the rice owl which occurred I think during the 
same school year, didn't I? I believe it was the

12:01.093 --> 12:04.017
same school year. Do you have any recollections 
about that episode? Yes.

12:12.389 --> 12:13.871
Rice had this owl. As I remember it, it must have 
been five feet tall, a stuffed owl.

12:23.282 --> 12:29.749
So the boys stole it and brought it back up and put it 
in the armory and locked the door. Where was the

12:29.769 --> 12:30.911
armory then? I think it was a room in the old main 
building, if I remember right. It probably would

12:37.659 --> 12:39.561
have been the new main building. The old one 
burned. Yeah, well, it was the one that's still

12:41.741 --> 12:46.228
there now. So, naturally, the rice men wanted to 
get the owl back. So they employed a man from the

12:53.679 --> 13:00.809
Burns Detective Agency to come up there and locate 
it. They had been up there and tried to find it, and

13:00.829 --> 13:04.314
they couldn't find it. So they employed this guy, 
and so he came up there and located it. So then he

13:12.143 --> 13:26.360
phoned and the rice men came up there and they got in 
there about 11 o'clock at night and broke in the

13:12.143 --> 13:26.360
army and started back with it. And they captured 
this guy, this Burns Detective Agency. And they

13:33.569 --> 13:39.055
had a kangaroo court up on the old Ross Hotel that 
was there. And they were very much rode up over that

13:41.742 --> 13:44.946
bird and he came up there for a fee. Said if it had 
been sportsmanship or rice boys, well that's all

13:46.107 --> 13:51.413
right. But that guy was hired to come up there. So 
they threatened every way to kill him from that on

13:55.938 --> 14:02.225
down. So finally up there on the second floor of 
Ross Hall, we had him up in the room. And they

14:10.852 --> 14:12.514
decided to cut his hair.

14:16.839 --> 14:21.325
And they made him bald-headed with some clippers. 
I remember that just as well as what happened

14:21.345 --> 14:25.550
yesterday.

14:25.570 --> 14:31.196
And a plane coming out of Bryan going south. It was 
about 1 o'clock or 1.30 or something.

14:36.683 --> 14:39.306
They had just got through clipping him. And they 
asked him if he thought he could catch that train.

14:46.371 --> 14:47.492
And he said he believed he could. He was scared. I 
thought they were going to hurt him. So they opened

14:51.156 --> 14:58.626
the door, and he hit the sidewalk rock. And he 
caught the train and went to Houston. Did the boy

15:02.671 --> 15:04.473
that took the owl get away? Was that any problems?

15:09.526 --> 15:11.167
They got it back to Houston some way.

15:14.390 --> 15:15.832
They scattered out. They took it back in the 
automobile. And a bunch of fellows got on this one

15:21.277 --> 15:32.387
o'clock train and stopped off at every station 
between College Station and Houston.

15:32.427 --> 15:34.889
I don't believe they found it. I think they got back 
to Houston, if I remember right. Something else

15:40.036 --> 15:47.708
has occurred to me to back up a minute about this 
university mascot. This one that was branded, was

15:47.868 --> 15:50.672
that the first one they ever had? Yeah, that was the 
first longhorn steer they had. Beautiful animal.

15:56.261 --> 16:00.167
Well, I had understood that it was a magnificent 
animal. They named him Bevo because that was a Back

16:03.425 --> 16:06.511
in Prohibition days, that was a near beer, you 
know. Non-intoxicating drink that had a beer

16:06.531 --> 16:12.142
flavor, I believe it was. Yeah. Was that name given 
to him before he was branded, do you know? I don't

16:15.809 --> 16:16.590
know. That's one of those things. One of the things 
we've been trying to track down is one story that

16:18.995 --> 16:34.825
has been handed down was that the boys over at the 
University in Austin took that 13-0 and branded

16:18.995 --> 16:34.825
over it and made Bevo out of it. I don't know. and 
from the pictures I've seen with, it would have to

16:35.690 --> 16:42.061
be some very strange looking letters too. Well 
they didn't, he never did come out anymore. He lost

16:45.046 --> 16:48.011
his soldier's mandate. That's the idea after he 
got that offer. Yeah, well I think that some more on

16:54.809 --> 16:56.030
the barbecue. I believe that it was in January of 
1920 that they finally butchered him and had a

16:56.090 --> 17:03.458
barbecue. That was after the war, you see. And we 
have on file an invitation to that barbecue in the

17:05.861 --> 17:15.331
gymnasium over at... That's interesting. ...in 
Austin. See, I left the door.

17:22.239 --> 17:24.141
Reveille, the dog. That was during my day, the 
first reveille. Well, we have a file. I'm sure you

17:29.460 --> 17:31.021
do have a big file. Newspaper clippings and so 
forth and pictures. And somewhere on campus we

17:34.404 --> 17:38.248
have a painting of the first reveille. Well, the 
first reveille was during my term.

17:45.715 --> 17:51.360
And then, of course, we have files on the 
successors as well, the second and third

17:45.715 --> 17:51.360
reveilles. And then we had some files of some other 
dogs. I guess at one time or another there were

17:56.659 --> 18:05.407
efforts to, between the first and the second 
Reveille, to have other dogs as mascots, but it

17:56.659 --> 18:05.407
never seemed to work out. Do they still have a 
Reveille? Yeah, still have a Reveille. And still

18:08.470 --> 18:11.153
under the charge of e-company.

18:16.438 --> 18:21.043
Were there any girls in any of the classes that you 
attended when you were there? The reason I ask is

18:21.563 --> 18:31.179
that all the professors' daughters tried to get in 
on some courses, but they couldn't. The

18:31.199 --> 18:32.861
professors lived on the campus.

18:35.225 --> 18:40.674
Well, I had understood from some people that, and I 
believe one of them was C.W. Crawford in

18:40.854 --> 18:48.246
mechanical engineering, that from time to time 
there were a few who Took some courses, and I

18:48.547 --> 18:52.792
believe his sister- Was that prior to World War I? 
I'm not sure that it was. I think it was after World

18:53.873 --> 18:56.657
War I. Because his sister, I believe, finished a 
degree there in 24, which means she would have

18:56.797 --> 19:03.505
started after the war, probably. Of course, there 
were the Hudson twins, much, much earlier than

19:04.466 --> 19:10.133
that, who took some courses in engineering.

19:12.436 --> 19:16.461
And they, I guess, finished the whole curriculum, 
but didn't get a degree.

19:19.293 --> 19:28.243
We know that a lot of the students who were at A&M had 
jobs of one sort or another to help make ends meet or

19:19.293 --> 19:28.243
help pay their tuition. Did you ever have a job when 
you were there? No, I didn't. Okay. Did you know

19:34.930 --> 19:36.532
people who did? Oh, yeah. There's a lot of boys who 
worked with me. What sort of things did they do?

19:42.057 --> 19:46.262
Well, all the way from dice shooting on down. I know 
a boy went through that, I guess, four years, the

19:47.440 --> 19:53.986
last two or three years, with his dice. But they had 
legitimate jobs. They worked down in the barns.

20:01.353 --> 20:03.234
They worked in the laboratories. They did janitor 
work, not in the barracks. They had men to do that,

20:08.399 --> 20:12.963
but in the classrooms. That's why there was some 
job to work, down at the dairy. different places.

20:20.359 --> 20:21.961
Do you have any idea how much they were paid? I have 
no idea.

20:26.827 --> 20:44.469
Did the students who played, now this would be on 
the regular teams of football, baseball,

20:26.827 --> 20:44.469
basketball, and so forth, have better treatment 
say than the rest of you fellows who didn't

20:26.827 --> 20:44.469
participate in those? Well they did athletics 
table down in the mess hall. They got, I expect they

20:48.292 --> 20:51.237
got more stakes than we did. You had it once a week. 
We had it on Thursday night, but they didn't have a,

20:52.299 --> 21:01.596
they weren't off in a barrack to themselves. They 
were scattered throughout the Corps, and they

21:01.676 --> 21:08.950
were, they were relieved of a lot of military 
drilling. they were working on out there, they

21:09.284 --> 21:14.513
were excused. They were excused from walking the 
post. I would imagine during the time that the

21:17.858 --> 21:27.073
rescue students were in your afternoon drills, 
why three days a week they'd be practicing

21:17.858 --> 21:27.073
football.

21:40.216 --> 21:53.993
I noticed that from the Longhorn, the year that you 
graduated, getting your picture and your major

21:40.216 --> 21:53.993
and so forth and so on, indicated that you were a 
member of the Ross Volunteers. How were you chosen

21:56.236 --> 22:00.220
to be in that group? That was highly competitive. 
It was limited to a certain number, and I don't

22:02.864 --> 22:07.610
know, I don't recall how many. And you were voted 
on. They'd have an election in the spring of the

22:10.422 --> 22:21.293
year, or the next fall, and they met on Sunday 
afternoon. And each fella, he'd have his friend

22:21.313 --> 22:30.203
that he'd want to get into Ross Volunteers, and 
he'd put his name up for election. So you had to be

22:30.223 --> 22:31.884
nominated by somebody. Yes. Your friend would put 
your name up and they would vote on it.

22:39.447 --> 22:44.594
the one that have room for a certain number. And of 
all the men that were nominated by their friends,

22:44.614 --> 23:00.275
the one that got the ones maybe that had 30 
openings, whatever the opening was, the ones that

22:44.614 --> 23:00.275
got the most votes by then they were elected. Very, 
very fair. So who then voted? All the people who

23:02.718 --> 23:04.981
were members of the Ross Volunteers? Yeah, the 
Ross Volunteers would vote, you see. I'd want Bill

23:07.004 --> 23:09.167
Jones, for example. Another fella would want Sam 
Smith, put his name up, and then make a list, and

23:10.919 --> 23:17.145
they'd vote on it. And then you'd vote for, if they 
needed 30, you'd pick out the 30 men that you

23:17.165 --> 23:27.576
wanted, and the other fella would pick out the 30 
that he wanted, and the one that got the most votes

23:17.165 --> 23:27.576
would get in. For whatever number they needed. 
That's right. They had that many vacancies.

23:36.105 --> 23:38.587
Uh-huh. Okay. Did being in... The Ross Volunteers 
were only juniors and seniors, right? That's

23:44.846 --> 23:45.788
right. Did that require a considerable more 
amount of drill than your regular three hours a

23:45.808 --> 23:50.256
week? No, it didn't. Not too much drill. You'd get 
to wear a white uniform at the dance. That was the

23:57.589 --> 23:59.393
way it was going on. They'd wear a Ross Volunteer 
white uniform. At the dances and other socials. At

24:06.970 --> 24:07.931
any of the dances? That's right. Did you wear your 
white uniform or anything other than the social

24:08.792 --> 24:12.397
occasion? No, that's all. Just the social 
occasions. You wore your regular uniform. So it

24:16.982 --> 24:19.785
didn't excuse you from any other drill? No, no. 
You'd still be a member of your regular company?

24:25.292 --> 24:27.755
That's right. Is it that way now? I believe it is. 
How bad is it? You still have to be in the Corps,

24:32.358 --> 24:35.983
first of all, to be in the Ross Volunteers. Well, of 
course, everybody was in the Corps then. Yeah. And

24:39.208 --> 24:44.055
I believe that it's still juniors and seniors. And 
I'm not sure whether it's- They lost their

24:44.155 --> 24:49.543
understanding when they didn't make it to 
Compulsory Corps. I guess you have the record of

24:49.563 --> 24:52.828
it. In World War I, I think that'll bear out 
investigation. They furnished more officers

24:58.379 --> 25:01.263
than West Point. I believe in World War II also. 
Also World War II. See, my class was a senior, and we

25:05.588 --> 25:13.298
were seniors there. To graduate in June, they 
graduated us in April. That is, they let us go on

25:17.343 --> 25:26.074
into service in April, and graduated us early to 
get into service. Were there any academic

25:26.594 --> 25:28.657
requirements? Did you have to have a certain grade 
or something to be in the Ross Volunteers? Or no

25:32.703 --> 25:38.131
drill competence or anything like that? I think 
there may be some of that now. I'm not sure that

25:40.254 --> 25:46.003
they're still chosen by the other members.

25:47.063 --> 25:51.068
I probably should check on that to see exactly what 
the procedures are. But I believe... Academic

25:52.850 --> 25:54.893
rating had nothing to do with it. I believe you have 
to have a certain amount of academic rating. I

25:57.315 --> 25:59.018
think it would probably be good if it was.

26:02.342 --> 26:02.882
Let's go on. You indicated that your class 
graduated early, and I gather 100% of them went

26:03.022 --> 26:12.794
into the service immediately. Oh, yes. Everyone 
that could stand a physical examination went in.

26:17.523 --> 26:19.985
And where did you, where did you report to then? 
Most of us reported, well different places. Some

26:22.388 --> 26:29.856
of them went in, most of them though reported to 
Camp Leon Springs in San Antonio.

26:30.937 --> 26:38.224
And then of course the others, they went to the Navy 
or the Marine Corps, but nearly all of them went in

26:30.937 --> 26:38.224
there, went to Leon Springs. And then when we got to 
Leon Springs, they would transfer them into the

26:38.244 --> 26:46.112
artillery or into the cavalry or into the 
infantry. What branch did you serve in? I served in

26:51.998 --> 26:54.580
artillery. Where all did you serve? Just in the 
States. Just in the States. I was sent to Camp

26:59.324 --> 27:02.067
Taylor, an artillery school. Which is where? It's 
now Camp Knox, Louisville, Kentucky.

27:06.230 --> 27:07.352
Louisville, Kentucky. And what you primarily 
were involved in then? I did not get overseas. You

27:13.917 --> 27:16.260
were training new inductees? That's right. Okay, 
and you were released in what, 1919? Yeah,

27:23.682 --> 27:27.667
December 1919. And then what did you do? I went back 
home and went farming. What kind of farming did you

27:33.775 --> 27:35.277
do? Cotton farming, cattle. I did it pretty hard, 
the cattle. When I got out of service, cotton was 40

27:42.126 --> 27:46.191
cents a pound. It went to 12 cents a pound. The cows 
were $70 a head, and they went to $20 a head. So I

27:55.077 --> 27:55.958
started out. So how long did you remain in the 
farming business? 1927, when I moved to Amarillo.

28:06.573 --> 28:07.875
What led you to come to Amarillo? Well, Amarillo 
was a booming town then. It struck all around you. I

28:14.143 --> 28:18.790
moved out of the house I was born in when I moved to 
Amarillo. Two oldest children were born in St.

28:19.630 --> 28:23.675
Louis, but I was going to get away then. So you just 
kind of pulled up stakes from Caldwell and came

28:24.096 --> 28:27.820
west then? Came west, that's right. Did you move by 
automobile or did you have some other means of

28:30.223 --> 28:35.190
transportation? Well, it came in a model train. 
Model train. Wife and children came on the train. I

28:40.476 --> 28:42.960
came ahead of them. Did you have a prospect of a job 
here before you decided to move? No, I wasn't. Just

28:49.432 --> 28:53.517
opened up a little material business. Is that what 
then became the, ultimately, what? James Brick

28:57.823 --> 29:03.229
and Supply Company, which now be run by my son, Al, 
who's class 42. And then we also had a business in

29:03.310 --> 29:08.957
Lubbock, Western Brick and Supply Company. And I 
was interested in organizing, saving them, or

29:08.977 --> 29:17.127
saving the loan.

29:18.659 --> 29:23.846
Could you tell us a little bit about the business 
that you started? It was the supply company

29:24.446 --> 29:28.531
primarily of bricks and tiles. That's right. We 
went into other building materials. Well, did

29:32.036 --> 29:35.340
you... Steel windows, steel doors. Where did you 
get your brick? Did you have a plan for making them?

29:39.505 --> 29:42.369
No, there's no bricks been made in the pan. They're 
shipped from East Texas, or Mineral Wells, Texas,

29:42.389 --> 29:47.215
or Brownwood, Texas. all that brick that comes in 
here shipped in here they haven't found a suitable

29:48.207 --> 30:14.468
material here to make them so you you uh brought 
them in and sold them to contractors who were

29:48.207 --> 30:14.468
contractors and

29:48.207 --> 30:14.468
then you when did when did you uh sell your your 
company to your son? 59. 59.
