00:04.165 --> 00:09.432
Speaking of Bev Sheffield, I gained a good deal of 
respect for that man. And I respected him very much

00:09.492 --> 00:14.799
as a professional. He was in every sense a 
professional. He was also a person who did

00:18.023 --> 00:27.636
something that I wish a lot of parks or recreation 
directors would do. And I should not say parks,

00:28.677 --> 00:32.282
because William Osborne was head of parks. 
division in the Public Works Department. They

00:36.673 --> 00:52.756
have maintained a log to the very best of the 
ability of the department of every person who ever

00:36.673 --> 00:52.756
used City of Austin Park and Recreation 
facilities. This was an amazing thing. There were

00:57.303 --> 00:58.965
a couple of influences in this. One was those 
neighborhood pools. He kept a roster of the

01:03.042 --> 01:09.710
youngsters and the families they came from at all 
these neighborhood pools. Because the pools

01:09.730 --> 01:15.917
would be open from about 6 or 6.30 in the morning. 
They would shut down at 10 or 10.30, reopen at 2.30

01:15.937 --> 01:28.251
or something like that in the afternoon, and be 
open until sunset. Of course, the middle day thing

01:28.271 --> 01:32.796
was for cleaning and normal maintenance. But it 
was also a way to be sure that the pools didn't just

01:33.957 --> 01:38.703
become a lounging place. The mornings were 
particularly filled with swimming classes and

01:40.285 --> 01:46.673
various sorts of things. But Bev used that as one 
group. Secondly, the people who reserved tables

01:53.100 --> 02:03.373
in the municipal parks, he kept a permanent 
register of everybody who requested, made a

02:03.809 --> 02:15.702
reservation of a picnic table or a camping spot, 
that is a day camp spot, in any city park. He did the

02:17.083 --> 02:22.509
same thing for all of the people who used the 
municipal golf courses. He maintained that.

02:24.131 --> 02:27.595
Every tee-off time, he knew when every person had 
gone through. He did the same thing for the tennis

02:29.016 --> 02:31.639
centers. He kept a log of all of these people, and he 
made it a point. And of course, at Zilker Park, if

02:42.306 --> 03:02.672
there were activities there, whoever the prime 
movers were of those activities, Bev Sheffield

02:42.306 --> 03:02.672
could call on these people who were active park 
users

02:42.306 --> 03:02.672
on any issue that might threaten the sanctity or 
the utility, the protection of a park or a

03:03.057 --> 03:10.784
recreation program. And I had occasion one time to 
be in his offices down along the river when there

03:10.804 --> 03:23.395
was some issue being proposed before the city 
council by some group. And I don't remember what

03:25.036 --> 03:31.782
the issue was, but I remember Bev talking to his 
secretary and saying,

03:33.027 --> 03:48.966
let's start a chain telephone call because the 
city council on whatever it was, Thursday morning

03:33.027 --> 03:48.966
or Tuesday morning, will have this issue up. I know 
that these people will be interested. At that city

03:51.629 --> 04:01.380
council meeting, which was in the old, then the 
city council chamber, which maybe could seat 100

03:51.629 --> 04:01.380
people, he had over 200 people at the door. And this 
was on less than a 24-hour notice.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.029
Lots of pressure. Lots of pressure, but pressure 
that wasn't misapplied. It wasn't abused. And Bev

04:18.277 --> 04:22.681
always knew exactly whether to use it or not use it. 
And we were able, in the planning effort, to

04:23.762 --> 04:27.145
benefit from some of that. The contrary was the... 
Public Works Department had some rather narrow,

04:32.495 --> 04:46.171
in my judgment, narrow interpretations of what 
the thoroughfare system plan, major streets plan

04:32.495 --> 04:46.171
should be. And they were very skittish about 
issues where proposals might require widening of

04:47.533 --> 04:59.447
right of way or something of this sort. They would 
prefer, for example, to build four-lane

05:00.372 --> 05:11.344
thoroughfares with 36-foot of roadway.

05:11.364 --> 05:13.486
Maybe 40 if they felt very generous. This is a 
trademark of Austin, the narrow streets. That's

05:18.931 --> 05:21.334
largely the Public Works Department influence. 
Everybody that visits Austin remarks about this.

05:28.101 --> 05:29.923
Part of that was almost a A social philosophy, we 
don't want people to move too quickly. The

05:38.989 --> 05:43.893
thoroughfare was seen as a route of convenience, 
not a route of necessity. And therefore, that was a

05:45.034 --> 06:00.248
route to be preferred by people moving around the 
town, not to travel long distances, but just

05:45.034 --> 06:00.248
simply a route of travel, a route of convenience.

06:00.616 --> 06:06.926
probably has done more through the years to limit 
what happened. Hal had to work within the

06:06.946 --> 06:12.414
framework of getting, well, between two 
boundaries. One was getting across the concepts

06:13.015 --> 06:17.142
of the thoroughfare plan, major streets plan. The 
other was getting across or having to deal with

06:18.444 --> 06:29.020
public works people who, because they were 
engineering and the electrical engineer was the

06:18.444 --> 06:29.020
head of city government, were very, very strong in 
their role and could almost effectively cancel

06:29.438 --> 06:38.210
out any planning effort that could be done. So I 
think in the years subsequently,

06:38.830 --> 06:56.914
some of that control in public works, while it has 
diminished some, I don't see it really as having

06:38.830 --> 06:56.914
given way that much.

06:59.746 --> 07:04.851
Gus Lavander, good sweep, was then head of Public 
Works Department. Reuben Roundtree, that's

07:05.572 --> 07:10.477
R-O-U-N-T-R-E-A.

07:12.779 --> 07:28.875
Lavander's L-E-V-A-N-D-E-R. Like lavender, but 
you reverse the A and the E.

07:12.779 --> 07:28.875
Gus was very pro-planning, but Reuben Roundtree 
was very concerned about not infringing on

07:29.243 --> 07:33.629
neighboring property. So if it came down to a 
question of widening right-of-way or having a

07:33.669 --> 07:46.307
narrower roadway, he would opt for the narrower 
roadway in preference to taking a row of houses or

07:33.669 --> 07:46.307
business furniture. Hellwise, in later years 
when we were in Tulsa, I was confronted with the

07:47.789 --> 07:57.462
same problem with the director of public works in 
downtown Tulsa. And he found out, apparently,

07:58.235 --> 08:04.425
because of previous experience in dealing with 
these folks, how to get around them. And the city

08:05.366 --> 08:10.213
traffic engineer in Tulsa was due to retire in two 
years. But in the meantime, he was blocking every

08:10.814 --> 08:26.098
proposal for a continuous, comprehensive, 
one-way street pattern throughout the center of

08:10.814 --> 08:26.098
downtown Tulsa, which was absolutely essential 
for getting it to work properly. So Harold just

08:26.872 --> 08:43.116
simply hired Alan Voorhees to come in, and just 
simply by dint of professional overkill was able

08:26.872 --> 08:43.116
to convince the decision makers that that was the 
way to do it. I think, by response, I think that

08:43.136 --> 08:56.676
where that can work in a city like Tulsa, could work 
in Dallas, could work in Fort Worth, I have to

08:43.136 --> 08:56.676
admit, as much as I love the town, Austin is very, 
very, very provincial. And the provincialism is

09:03.600 --> 09:08.546
one of the things that adds to its appeal and its 
attraction. It's the thing that gets in its way a

09:08.566 --> 09:11.970
lot of times. I don't know that even Alan Voorhees' 
organization could have overpowered that

09:13.572 --> 09:21.080
situation. I really don't know that they could 
have because The underlying philosophy was we

09:24.770 --> 09:27.974
don't want people to move quickly. We want them to 
mosey along and enjoy the scenery. So you don't

09:31.538 --> 09:34.041
need wide streets. The same philosophy happens in 
Berkeley. Oh, is that right? Yeah. And there have

09:39.087 --> 09:43.572
been more than one comparisons drawn between 
Berkeley and Austin. And the philosophy in

09:45.475 --> 09:53.224
Berkeley is that it's a city of neighborhoods, and 
that people who are driving in Berkeley in

09:53.525 --> 09:55.267
Berkeley because they want to be there. They don't 
go through Berkeley to get somewhere else. Yeah,

09:58.730 --> 09:59.791
I've heard that.

10:03.754 --> 10:23.532
Looking at it a little further, looking at the 
consequences of the plan that Hal developed, I

10:03.754 --> 10:23.532
would also say that the conditions in Austin have 
also changed, as they have everywhere, but

10:03.754 --> 10:23.532
perhaps because Austin is now deciding it should 
be reaching out to the outside world, that the

10:23.883 --> 10:50.481
Balcones Research Lab operations, the whole 
concept of the

10:23.883 --> 10:50.481
computer technology and all of the offerings 
there, that seems to be influencing Austin, even

10:23.883 --> 10:50.481
to the extent that we will see in the Times Herald in 
Dallas. In the want ads, City of Austin, that's all

10:56.093 --> 11:17.733
it will say, City of Austin under a heading, won't 
even advertise for a specific job, but they will

10:56.093 --> 11:17.733
have periodically these one-liners in the 
classifieds, obviously trying to keep people in

10:56.093 --> 11:17.733
the Dallas area interested in what's going on in 
city government in Austin. Nobody else is putting

11:17.773 --> 11:19.995
those ads in except the city. People in College 
Station don't read the Dallas Times-Herald. Oh,

11:25.568 --> 11:26.008
they don't? That's interesting. They do good to 
read. Because of the comments of your sports

11:30.835 --> 11:36.662
editors about our recruiting methods. That 
needn't be on the page.

11:52.375 --> 12:19.378
Beyond the plan for the city, the long-term plan 
that Hal Wise and his associates developed, and

11:52.375 --> 12:19.378
while I say developed, it was really in concert 
with input from the staff, which were essentially

11:52.375 --> 12:19.378
concerned with the day-to-day planning 
activities, and input from department heads. I

12:20.405 --> 12:24.390
think there are a couple of things that should be 
noted. Were there staff planners that should be

12:24.590 --> 12:28.114
mentioned? Yeah. OK. Let me just mention that. One 
of the people that was a very strong personality in

12:30.857 --> 12:38.907
all of this on the day-to-day operations was Wayne 
Golden. Wayne was in a rather lesser level

12:40.108 --> 12:47.577
position when I went there as planning director. 
By the time I left, he was heading up the current

12:48.282 --> 12:54.190
planning activities. Then by the time the major 
effort of Hal Wise was completed, Evelyn Slatum

12:54.931 --> 13:17.901
Butler was ready to, she was moving into a number 
two position under Hoyle Osborne, who was then

12:54.931 --> 13:17.901
responsible for advanced planning. in between 
Jerry Finley who came down from the state of

13:19.147 --> 13:48.495
Washington and no

13:19.147 --> 13:48.495
I take that back he was from Oregon and he was 
essentially our staff research person Ruben

13:19.147 --> 13:48.495
Vallejo who has since been with HUD over the years, 
based in Fort Worth, and was, in fact, planner on

13:49.488 --> 14:04.730
the staff in Fort Worth when I went there later, 
many years later, and then left and went with HUD.

14:05.952 --> 14:10.057
These were some of the key people in the staff. 
There were some others in various roles, but I'd

14:10.097 --> 14:16.527
like to point out a couple of things. One is, 
because of Wayne Golden's efforts. And this was

14:21.979 --> 14:32.230
the frontline soldier kind of effort that had to be 
dealt with, had to be worked at all the time. Wayne,

14:33.291 --> 14:47.946
through the supportive provision in the Austin 
City Charter and the supporting provisions in

14:33.291 --> 14:47.946
state law providing for extraterritorial 
jurisdiction, Wayne was able to convince the

14:48.837 --> 15:18.186
county commissioners that we should not be giving 
final clearance to subdivision plants outside

14:48.837 --> 15:18.186
the city limits within our extraterritorial 
jurisdiction unless the county commissioners

14:48.837 --> 15:18.186
were also willing to impose certain standards in 
the nature of public improvements on streets and

15:18.757 --> 15:20.779
and other public facilities. The city of Austin 
had leverage in this because there were, I believe

15:22.760 --> 15:41.656
at the time in existence then, seven water control 
improvement districts that extended outside the

15:22.760 --> 15:41.656
city limits. In fact, went all the way to the county 
line. And in some cases, north and south went

15:44.659 --> 15:48.342
beyond the county line. So that in one area of the 
north, for instance, one of those water control

15:49.942 --> 15:59.034
improvement districts, as I recall, was into 
Williamson County. That meant, because the city

16:00.756 --> 16:17.417
of Austin was the supplier of the water, of the 
treated water, to the water control improvement

16:00.756 --> 16:17.417
district, the city of Austin could impose certain 
restrictions or improvement requirements on any

16:17.802 --> 16:24.990
subdivision in this extraterritorial 
jurisdiction, even if it were 10, 15 miles outside

16:17.802 --> 16:24.990
the city limits. But that would be fine with 
respect to utilities. But what we did not have

16:30.416 --> 16:36.202
adequate support on was the boundary streets. Nor 
did we really have a level of authority within the

16:44.498 --> 16:47.781
subdivisions as to street improvements. And in 
that regard, Wayne Golden made it a point to

16:47.981 --> 17:06.959
convince the county commissioners, and he 
deserves full credit for it, that they should

16:47.981 --> 17:06.959
adopt some standards for street construction in 
unincorporated areas. Now, the standards were

17:07.580 --> 17:10.563
not that great. As one would look back on it today, 
one would probably say, hey, why didn't he do

17:15.160 --> 17:19.427
something more than that? The truth of the matter 
was, up until that point, we had no standards. And

17:24.196 --> 17:32.851
it was a matter of getting something on the books 
where there would be a good, reasonably durable,

17:24.196 --> 17:32.851
20-year life hard top road. And Wayne was the 
person who really managed to put that together,

17:34.754 --> 17:39.362
that idea. And the county commissioners backed 
it, and they would not approve the subdivision

17:40.017 --> 17:53.933
outside the city limits, nor the providing of any 
county services to that subdivision until the

17:40.017 --> 17:53.933
developer put those streets in. Now, we didn't 
have the lever to get them to maintain the streets.

18:00.240 --> 18:07.088
But the county then, once the street would be 
dedicated, then had to pick up the maintenance

18:00.240 --> 18:07.088
responsibility. County commissioners were 
beginning to see the consequence of poor streets.

18:13.411 --> 18:15.333
So Wayne really deserves credit for that. The 
other thing that we were able to accomplish was a

18:17.355 --> 18:29.127
base mapping program, which for the most part was 
my brainchild. And we were able to get through tax

18:29.147 --> 18:37.176
maps and other maps from public works departments 
We were able to get the material using US

18:38.084 --> 19:02.758
Geological Survey photos as the controls and maps 
that USGS made for us, base maps with the

18:38.084 --> 19:02.758
appropriate property identification for a very, 
very large area in Austin and Travis County. I

19:03.515 --> 19:06.999
don't know whether those maps are still being 
used. I suspect not. Certainly today there are

19:09.342 --> 19:13.206
more adequate methods of putting things 
together. But we had one whole wall that was 8 feet

19:13.647 --> 19:24.659
high and 12 feet long where the maps were literally 
fitted together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

19:24.679 --> 19:31.227
And then from that shot down so that we could get 
base maps. a tremendous undertaking, but it did

19:31.780 --> 19:37.568
turn out to be, I think, a very worthwhile 
endeavor.

19:41.533 --> 19:53.089
Now, Austin has always had a particularly good 
reputation in terms of subdivision review

19:41.533 --> 19:53.089
procedures within the planning department. 
Would you like to go into that? That procedure,

19:54.911 --> 19:59.357
basically, After I arrived in Austin in 53, we 
built on the procedure, expanded on it from what

19:59.692 --> 20:14.987
had been used up until that point, and Wayne Golden 
was the man responsible for maintaining that

19:59.692 --> 20:14.987
procedure. He and a man by the name of Foxworth were 
both involved in this to some extent.

20:28.227 --> 20:53.317
The thing that happened with the establishment of 
the Planning Commission under the new city

20:28.227 --> 20:53.317
charter was to make clear the responsibility of 
the Planning Commission to exercise per state

20:28.227 --> 20:53.317
law, but in behalf of all city departments, the 
review and approval of subdivision plans, both

20:28.227 --> 20:53.317
the preliminary plans and the final plans for 
record. The commission, set up a schedule. And

21:00.627 --> 21:05.994
this was perhaps somewhat unique, especially at 
that time it was unique. And that was that the

21:06.014 --> 21:14.784
commission set its regular meetings every third 
week.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.629
Those were, it did not matter what the month was. We 
started in the first week of the year, and every

21:19.269 --> 21:25.677
third week thereafter, there was a Planning 
Commission meeting. The Board of Adjustment, met

21:27.560 --> 21:31.966
also on a three-week schedule in between those. 
But the commission's two, or I should, well, three

21:32.087 --> 21:47.309
committees, a master plan committee, a 
subdivision committee, and a zoning committee

21:32.087 --> 21:47.309
met on three-week schedules also. The zoning 
committee meeting two weeks, as I recall, two

21:47.809 --> 21:55.120
weeks before the commission meeting. 
subdivision review committee or plaque

21:55.842 --> 22:00.808
committee meeting one week before the commission 
meeting. One of the things that was accomplished

22:02.550 --> 22:15.085
there, and I think it is really a credit to the whole 
Austin staff, was a desire to see an improved

22:02.550 --> 22:15.085
quality of subdivisions. And subdivision 
control was viewed as being rather critical.

22:22.694 --> 22:25.798
Zoning was, I hate to say it, but seemed to be 
flaunted some, and I guess to some extent that

22:26.065 --> 22:39.743
accusation might still be made in lots of cities, 
in that it was a political trade-off or something

22:26.065 --> 22:39.743
or other. Not a payoff, but a trade-off. If you 
allow this, then what happens here on this other

22:42.486 --> 22:47.173
property? But with subdivision control, there 
was an earnest desire to improve the the

22:55.580 --> 23:10.234
conveyance of property to be sure that the 
necessary provisions be made for public

22:55.580 --> 23:10.234
utilities and private utilities and for 
protection of drainage ways. There was a concern

23:11.476 --> 23:20.725
within the planning department about adequacy 
and right of way for especially the major streets.

23:22.166 --> 23:25.249
But the whole process went very, very smoothly. 
And I think even people with whom I had dealings,

23:25.651 --> 23:55.084
sometimes at moments of some heightened 
difference of opinion, had to say that they felt

23:25.651 --> 23:55.084
they were basically and overall treated fairly, 
even though they might not like the decision that

23:25.651 --> 23:55.084
came out of a subdivision committee meeting or out 
of the commission meeting on a proposed plan. For

23:56.363 --> 24:03.990
the most part, I think they had to say the process 
worked well and nobody was handicapped. Nobody

24:04.010 --> 24:08.514
was hindered unnecessarily in accomplishing 
what they wanted to do. One of those is a builder, a

24:09.275 --> 24:17.342
developer, that is still building right here in 
the Dallas area, and that's Nash Phillips Copas.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.927
Nash Phillips was always the arbitrator in the 
organization. Clyde Copas was sort of like the

24:21.987 --> 24:25.510
baddie rooster, always wanting to get on with 
something and not pay too much attention or

24:25.928 --> 24:32.855
wanting to be bothered too much by rules and 
regulations. But that's when Clyde was younger.

24:37.179 --> 24:41.303
And I think he's changed his line some since over 
the years. But you mentioned Evelyn. Yes. What was

24:46.188 --> 24:47.109
her role? Evelyn had the review in the case of 
subdivisions and of zoning. She had the review

24:52.534 --> 24:55.497
from the standpoint of, The plan, the long-range 
plan, what were the implications for the

24:55.679 --> 25:00.948
long-range plan? And where Wayne was really the 
administrator for subdivisions, Evelyn was the

25:02.150 --> 25:14.369
reviewer, not on the internals of the 
subdivision, but rather on the impact issue. What

25:15.271 --> 25:22.142
externally could impact on the subdivision, and 
how would the subdivision itself impact on the

25:15.271 --> 25:22.142
community? So hers was really one of looking at the 
long range consequences more than the short

25:23.287 --> 25:28.654
range. Wade's was the job of getting this thing 
through the process and through the pipeline.

25:36.563 --> 25:50.340
Hoyle, Osborne, had responsibility in examining 
subdivisions to the extent, as I recall, to the

25:36.563 --> 25:50.340
extent that he would try to make some judgments on 
either the social or the economic consequences of

25:51.012 --> 26:03.227
a particular subdivision on a total area related 
to things that Evelyn was looking at. But she was

26:03.287 --> 26:06.691
normally looking at the physical design 
implications. He was looking more at the social

26:06.711 --> 26:11.437
and economic implications. And team-wise, it was 
a pretty darn good team, frankly. I always felt

26:16.764 --> 26:19.467
very good about that situation.

26:22.805 --> 26:30.392
Then you left to go to... Yeah, when I left Austin, I 
went to Yuma, Arizona. What year was that? That was

26:31.533 --> 26:33.675
1958. I was in Austin from 53 to 58. And Hoyle 
Osborne took over. And Hoyle then took over

26:37.839 --> 26:40.762
immediately. I left the operation in his good 
hands. And I might add, there was one other person

26:44.265 --> 26:51.732
there that was not a planner, but had been in the 
operation before that, And that was Jewel Osburn.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.766
She's since retired from the city. And she was... 
Any relation? No, no relation, and the spelling is

27:00.069 --> 27:02.270
different. Hers

27:02.310 --> 27:08.015
without an E on the end of it. O-S-B-O-R-N and his 
O-S-B-O-R-N-E. And then there was a William

27:08.476 --> 27:17.623
Osburn in public works who was O-S-B-U-R-N.

27:19.625 --> 27:22.107
But Jewel Osburn was... secretary under Bill 
Parker, William O. Parker, when Bill was, and he

27:22.441 --> 27:43.309
was really my predecessor, but he had been in the 
job on

27:22.441 --> 27:43.309
somewhat of a staff support role under Public 
Works before the charter revisions. He was in part

27:43.349 --> 27:52.161
of that time, during part of those several years 
before, he was finishing up his degree in

27:43.349 --> 27:52.161
architecture. at UT Austin. And he had also done, 
in fact, he was the designer. This is somewhat

27:59.245 --> 28:11.680
interesting because the city of Austin and Walter 
Seaholm, the city manager, really wouldn't give

27:59.245 --> 28:11.680
Bill Parker the freedom to move like a planning 
operation should have. But Bill was the designer

28:12.421 --> 28:22.013
for Mo Ranch, which is the Presbyterian facility 
that down in Kerrville area that is even to this day

28:22.668 --> 28:32.423
very popular amongst people in the Presbyterian 
Church that go down there for retreats and so on.

28:32.443 --> 28:43.299
And he was really the planner for that facility, 
and it's been built largely according to the

28:32.443 --> 28:43.299
design concepts that Bill Parker laid out. But 
Bill would have been great there if he'd had the

28:43.319 --> 28:49.148
kind of freedom I had, but he just didn't have it. He 
was the first planning director. He was called

28:52.875 --> 28:56.062
City Planner. That was his official title. And 
never recognized in the status of a department

28:58.427 --> 29:02.536
head. I was the first one going in with recognition 
as a department head.

29:14.272 --> 29:21.704
When I left Austin in 1958, I went to Yuma to head the 
city county planning department. And in that

29:21.724 --> 29:37.889
particular instance, they had a plan done by 
Stanford Research Institute,

29:21.724 --> 29:37.889
which was questionable in a lot of areas. I had to 
live with the thing. I didn't know that they did

29:40.413 --> 29:42.456
plan. I think it was one of the few ventures. And the 
person who had preceded me who was there before SRI

29:45.705 --> 30:12.257
came in was an

29:45.705 --> 30:12.257
electro-hydraulics engineer who somehow or 
other had happened in the Yuma because of being

29:45.705 --> 30:12.257
associated with dams and hydro-generating 
facilities. in the Northwest and the Colorado

30:12.642 --> 30:16.025
River and so on. He wound up there. My principal 
activities in Yuma were one, to bridge conflicts

30:19.128 --> 30:28.196
between city and county government. Second, it 
was obviously not possible to do much since the

30:28.216 --> 30:38.546
community was on the plan, since the community was 
very proud of having that plan in their hands.

30:39.687 --> 30:42.109
Although there was a lot of negative feeling 
toward my predecessor. I had pretty good support

30:46.793 --> 30:50.799
from both city and county government. In fact, I 
would say overall very good support from the

30:50.920 --> 30:55.927
county supervisors. The city government, which 
was under a mayor council operational form, was

30:56.528 --> 31:10.189
not

30:56.528 --> 31:10.189
too well oriented to planning because All of their 
decisions were very much short range this year or

31:10.625 --> 31:18.137
next year at the most. And many of the things that 
really needed to be addressed were the long range

31:19.259 --> 31:24.047
issues. However, a couple of things were 
accomplished in very specific terms. One was

31:31.359 --> 31:34.945
getting some coordination with the State Highway 
Department on the location of the Interstate

31:35.110 --> 31:46.302
Highway coming out of Tucson and Phoenix.
