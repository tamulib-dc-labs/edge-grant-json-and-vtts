WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:04.141
Battery is not down.

00:09.531 --> 00:19.590
At that time of Mr. Zachary's speech, what was the general attitude about the faculty regarding A&M's progress?

00:20.592 --> 00:25.161
Did you and your friends think we were moving forward, standing still, or what?

00:28.195 --> 00:36.924
Well, essentially, I think we were standing still for a long—Rutter is the first person that really started to move this place forward.

00:39.106 --> 00:46.514
Did—do you remember faculty talk about coeducation and non-compulsory cohort?

00:47.995 --> 00:55.603
Well, after Calhoun had been here a couple years, so this is shortly after I had been here, I

00:57.524 --> 01:04.313
ended up by being the chairman of the Faculty Advisory Council of the College of Engineering.

01:04.673 --> 01:05.875
Oh, talk about that.

01:07.397 --> 01:15.267
And one of the things that we did was propose that we have limited co-education.

01:17.009 --> 01:19.793
It came off unanimously on us.

01:21.115 --> 01:25.340
And we were restrictive on it.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.822
We wanted it for

01:27.224 --> 01:36.317
Wives, daughters, and wives and daughters of the staff.

01:36.978 --> 01:38.621
So it had been fairly restrictive.

01:39.302 --> 01:44.670
Now up till that time, in summer school, women could come, but they couldn't come here during the regular year.

01:46.352 --> 01:49.757
And so we passed this on.

01:51.099 --> 01:55.746
Calhoun passed it on with his approval.

01:56.705 --> 02:00.170
We had an acting president then, I don't know.

02:01.012 --> 02:05.258
He passed it on to the Board of Regents without any recommendation.

02:08.824 --> 02:13.692
And Harrington was chancellor then.

02:18.319 --> 02:24.248
I got a letter directed to me as chairman of

02:26.017 --> 02:37.617
faculty advisory council from Harrington, that essentially said, mind my own damn business.

02:37.637 --> 02:43.527
And that it had not even received a motion to approve.

02:45.871 --> 02:50.860
And a letter went on to tell us to continue to mind our own business.

02:53.219 --> 02:57.445
Describe this, make believe I didn't know John Calhoun.

02:57.486 --> 02:59.288
Describe him as the dean.

03:00.210 --> 03:01.512
What kind of person was he?

03:01.792 --> 03:03.074
What kind of leader was he?

03:05.498 --> 03:07.801
Well, he made some changes.

03:07.942 --> 03:11.467
I think he'd have changes coming up from the faculty.

03:11.567 --> 03:15.353
I think the faculty advisory council was a very useful thing to him.

03:15.994 --> 03:21.162
Did he seem bright and progressive to you all?

03:21.542 --> 03:21.943
Yeah.

03:23.257 --> 03:29.285
The only thing is that when he got to be Vice President, he added too many people to the hierarchy.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.530
But nothing compared to what it is today?

03:33.770 --> 03:34.071
No.

03:36.274 --> 03:43.963
No, I remember Byers when we had, I think, about 30,000 students here when Byers was Vice President.

03:45.605 --> 03:47.728
He says, there's no reason why

03:48.586 --> 03:56.257
The secretary in the first and half time can't manage the academic part of this university, and that's what he did.

03:58.340 --> 04:02.386
Describe, as you all saw it, describe Dr. Calhoun's personality.

04:04.509 --> 04:06.852
Oh, he's a very friendly person.

04:06.872 --> 04:10.558
When I meet him today, he still chats and talks.

04:10.578 --> 04:12.560
In those early days, did he have any energy?

04:13.562 --> 04:14.323
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:15.586 --> 04:17.729
He had a lot of... Well, he has an interview today.

04:17.749 --> 04:18.350
You bet.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.212
Did he seem bright?

04:21.834 --> 04:22.515
Imaginative?

04:23.657 --> 04:31.127
Well, that you can't tell, because, you know, there's always that conflict between the faculty and the administration.

04:32.068 --> 04:37.035
Because the faculty never thinks the administration is doing anything right anyway.

04:37.055 --> 04:38.837
And you probably had that experience, too.

04:38.957 --> 04:39.979
Oh, yes.

04:39.999 --> 04:40.940
All right.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.665
And then he moved on up to be a vice president or chancellor

04:44.864 --> 04:46.586
Vice president.

04:46.606 --> 04:48.909
And then Fred Benson became dean.

04:51.433 --> 04:51.894
Yeah.

04:51.914 --> 04:54.697
Were y'all still in engineering when he became the dean?

04:54.717 --> 04:54.817
Yes.

04:55.198 --> 04:59.444
Describe Fred Benson as dean.

04:59.464 --> 05:13.723
Well, I think Paul Weaver said it appropriately because he said it to Fred

05:14.024 --> 05:24.245
When you left teaching and research to become a dean, it was just a ruination of a good teacher.

05:24.265 --> 05:29.756
And essentially, I think it's difficult to do both.

05:31.559 --> 05:35.948
And this is one of the problems that I think I had

05:36.653 --> 05:40.578
when I got interested in doing these teacher education programs.

05:41.198 --> 05:45.624
It's hard to do those and do research to, and I did it for a while.

05:45.964 --> 05:47.026
When did you begin that?

05:49.128 --> 05:54.254
Well, the first research I did was shortly after the first teacher program I had.

05:55.155 --> 06:02.905
I had a project with Lawrence Radiation Lab that ran up through about three years, through 63.

06:03.846 --> 06:05.648
It had to do with

06:07.282 --> 06:18.535
the use of nuclear explosives for engineering projects, and they worry about radioactive contamination of the ground and groundwater.

06:18.575 --> 06:31.230
And for that time, that was a considerable amount of money running into a couple hundred thousand dollars a year, which translated to nowadays

06:32.763 --> 06:35.507
up there in the millions.

06:37.490 --> 06:53.795
But that was, during that period was the same period that I was instrumental in getting two blacks admitted to the university in the Summer Institute program.

06:54.356 --> 06:57.440
Please describe that as fully as you can.

06:59.203 --> 06:59.884
Well,

07:00.927 --> 07:01.909
Coleman-Lloyd.

07:02.049 --> 07:02.870
When was it?

07:02.910 --> 07:03.411
Do you remember?

07:03.892 --> 07:04.693
It was in 63.

07:04.894 --> 07:04.994
Okay.

07:05.415 --> 07:14.189
The applications were coming in, and you generally got your grant in January.

07:14.209 --> 07:17.094
The applications would come in in about March.

07:18.517 --> 07:26.530
And Coleman-Lloyd, in looking at the applications, and we had programs in earth science

07:26.932 --> 07:34.222
in probably biology and chemistry and physics and math.

07:35.183 --> 07:38.307
So we had about five programs here on the campus.

07:38.948 --> 07:46.257
So they had a special office set up called the NSF Programs Office that helped to coordinate at all these things.

07:46.277 --> 07:49.301
Now was Coleman the coordinator in that office?

07:51.284 --> 07:51.484
Yeah.

07:51.524 --> 07:52.045
Okay.

07:52.582 --> 07:57.549
It eventually got combined with the Office of University of Research later on.

07:58.791 --> 08:06.381
And then as the programs died out, because Sputnik is the thing that started that.

08:09.986 --> 08:18.758
But anyway, he said, in looking at the applications, he says, we're getting a lot of applicants that are black.

08:19.852 --> 08:22.816
And up to that time, we hadn't admitted black students.

08:23.297 --> 08:25.360
Now, these were school teachers?

08:25.400 --> 08:27.744
School teachers.

08:27.764 --> 08:35.075
Because they, generally, if you, in those days, you looked at where they graduated.

08:35.175 --> 08:43.788
Because if they graduated from a typical black school, you'd figure they were black also.

08:43.808 --> 08:45.711
And so then you wouldn't admit them.

08:45.911 --> 08:48.475
So we...

08:50.497 --> 08:58.206
So Coleman said we ought to have a meeting with Rudder on this, talk about it.

08:58.487 --> 09:06.436
And so I don't know whether it was I or Coleman made arrangements with Rudder.

09:07.438 --> 09:13.665
I don't remember, Rudder had an assistant that was retired from the military.

09:13.805 --> 09:14.706
Dorsey McCrory.

09:15.007 --> 09:16.949
Yes, that's right, Dorsey McCrory.

09:17.410 --> 09:19.272
He used to live across the street from me.

09:19.910 --> 09:26.877
So I got with him, and I told him, get with Rudder ahead of time and prime him about what this is about.

09:26.977 --> 09:27.938
So I told him.

09:28.898 --> 09:33.643
Now, when we walked in the meeting, I said to Dorsey, did you get a chance to talk to Rudder?

09:33.943 --> 09:34.724
He says, no.

09:38.708 --> 09:46.575
So we had this confrontation then.

09:47.753 --> 09:58.848
where we talked about this, and we thought we were going to get hit by NAACP, and we didn't want them.

09:58.868 --> 10:05.837
And of course, I said, well, we ought to admit blacks.

10:05.857 --> 10:14.188
And Rudder said, Schroeder, don't you think I'm doing a good job running this university?

10:14.849 --> 10:16.731
I says, yes, you are.

10:17.521 --> 10:23.087
But Kennedy, the Attorney General, is going to tell you what to do in this case.

10:26.030 --> 10:28.633
And the meeting, well, broke up then.

10:28.933 --> 10:32.677
Now, I went and got ahead of Wayne Hall.

10:33.678 --> 10:35.160
Vice President of Academic Affairs.

10:35.901 --> 10:40.646
Yeah, he was, well, before that, he'd been Dean of the Graduate College.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.768
Yes, yes.

10:43.048 --> 10:43.849
And I said,

10:44.639 --> 10:47.183
I sent a letter, actually, to him.

10:48.265 --> 10:49.667
He said, I'm going to send you a letter.

10:51.930 --> 10:55.055
Because in those days, you know, you could talk to people on this campus.

10:55.075 --> 10:59.963
You didn't have to go through a secretary.

10:59.983 --> 11:05.331
Back as the head of fiscal affairs, whenever I had a proposal, I always used to take it over.

11:05.598 --> 11:09.063
And he'd already talked to me several times about other proposals.

11:09.123 --> 11:10.766
He said, does this fit everything?

11:10.886 --> 11:11.507
I said, yes.

11:11.687 --> 11:12.849
I'll say, I'll sign it.

11:12.989 --> 11:14.892
Nowadays, I want to look at it.

11:15.433 --> 11:18.838
So it's impossible to get a proposal off this campus.

11:18.978 --> 11:21.241
And let's go back to this.

11:21.361 --> 11:31.176
Well, I talked to Fred Manson and- Wait, what was Hall's reaction to the idea?

11:32.518 --> 11:33.259
Wayne Hall.

11:34.133 --> 11:34.915
Was he positive?

11:34.935 --> 11:35.115
No.

11:35.235 --> 11:50.205
Well, what had happened, I told Wayne Hall that he was going to have to—if I wasn't going to be able to pick who I wanted to, he was going to have to pick the participants of my summer institute.

11:50.485 --> 11:53.391
The administration was going to have to do.

11:53.962 --> 12:01.849
So I talked to Shirley Lynch, and Shirley Lynch and I went over and talked to Fred Benson.

12:03.250 --> 12:11.538
And Fred said, well, isn't the law so you can't do this?

12:11.658 --> 12:13.039
We have to admit anybody?

12:14.801 --> 12:18.464
He says, didn't they know that when they signed this proposal up there?

12:20.866 --> 12:21.927
Well, I said, yes.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.111
Okay.

12:25.132 --> 12:41.136
You write a letter with a list of all the participants' names through Shirley Lynch, through me, to Wayne Hall, and I'll assign it and prove it all the way.

12:41.497 --> 12:43.560
So, that's what we did.

12:45.768 --> 12:55.701
And so when it was getting about two weeks had passed, I phoned and talked to Wayne, and I said, all right, when are you going to select my participants?

12:58.044 --> 13:02.009
And he said, you are going to select them.

13:02.029 --> 13:07.155
That means I can select whoever I want, regardless of race?

13:07.696 --> 13:08.497
He said yes.

13:09.979 --> 13:14.104
So I said, I will pick some from Texas,

13:15.164 --> 13:21.179
that know the mores of this state so that we don't have any problems.

13:22.422 --> 13:31.485
And as a result, a fellow named Bernal Jackson was

13:32.900 --> 13:41.269
selected from here and somebody might have, I think it was Collins from Fort Worth was selected.

13:41.629 --> 13:42.850
Those are the two black students?

13:42.991 --> 13:43.811
Two black students.

13:43.831 --> 13:46.955
Now you said Vernal Jackson from here?

13:47.235 --> 13:48.656
Yeah, Brian.

13:48.676 --> 13:48.877
Oh.

13:49.597 --> 13:56.865
Yeah, and the Eagle unfortunately got word of this and said he'd been admitted to the university.

13:59.360 --> 14:08.396
And his name was such, Arnold Jackson, his address was so-and-so, and his telephone number was so-and-so.

14:08.597 --> 14:18.174
And when I saw that in the paper, I said, oh, brother, that is an invitation to harassment.

14:18.194 --> 14:19.656
But nobody phoned him.

14:20.478 --> 14:20.558
Hmm.

14:22.462 --> 14:27.890
Now, and these were people, high school teachers with a baccalaureate.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.352
High school or middle school.

14:29.372 --> 14:31.975
Yeah, and they had a baccalaureate degree at least.

14:32.856 --> 14:32.957
Yeah.

14:32.977 --> 14:37.523
And this was a summer course for graduate credit.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.985
Graduate credit, right.

14:40.147 --> 14:43.351
All right, describe how the course went with them in it.

14:43.812 --> 14:44.773
Well, uh.

14:46.323 --> 14:59.540
The thing is that we had meteorology and oceanography being taught that term, so I wasn't directly involved in the course.

15:01.403 --> 15:14.760
However, the program was set up so that we had a five-day field trip involved that everyone was on.

15:16.006 --> 15:27.757
We spent three days in Oklahoma, two nights in a hotel, except the hotel wouldn't take the blacks.

15:28.137 --> 15:30.819
They made an arrangement to put them out in a boarding house.

15:31.580 --> 15:36.024
And then this— Where in Oklahoma was that?

15:36.044 --> 15:36.645
Ardmore.

15:36.665 --> 15:37.165
In Ardmore?

15:37.185 --> 15:37.425
Okay.

15:37.445 --> 15:46.013
And so the second night, the hotel owner said to me, we'll bring them back in.

15:46.769 --> 15:49.094
that I might as well integrate this hotel.

15:50.035 --> 15:59.695
Because you remember in those days, if you were black and wanting to travel across, say, the country, you couldn't find any place to stay at night.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.157
True, true.

16:01.358 --> 16:07.109
And the first, well, Holiday Inn was the first one to start to do it.

16:07.169 --> 16:09.013
They made it into general policy.

16:09.854 --> 16:16.866
did y'all have in any way, with the participants in the class, did y'all have any awkwardness?

16:17.207 --> 16:17.407
No.

16:17.548 --> 16:18.249
Any incidents?

16:18.449 --> 16:18.589
No.

16:20.052 --> 16:23.879
And as you ate on this field trip?

16:23.959 --> 16:25.562
Well, let's put it this way.

16:26.303 --> 16:30.951
The best restaurant in downtown Ardmore,

16:34.087 --> 16:46.950
I had already walked in with a group, and two blacks were walking in, and the restaurant owner said, you can't be admitted.

16:48.012 --> 16:50.497
And Clay Seward was right behind him.

16:50.577 --> 16:56.888
Now, Clay Seward is a native Texan, was raised on the Seward Plantation.

16:59.686 --> 17:10.725
And when he grew up, the only children he had to play with were the sons and daughters of slaves that had been on that plantation in the early days.

17:11.046 --> 17:13.069
Black children and white children playing together.

17:14.071 --> 17:21.624
And so he said, you see all of those 30 people that have just walked in?

17:22.766 --> 17:23.888
You want their business?

17:27.665 --> 17:30.248
That's all he said.

17:30.268 --> 17:31.390
The fellow said, okay.

17:32.612 --> 17:35.115
So we integrated a hotel and this.

17:35.856 --> 17:40.262
Later on, I integrated some other hotels across Texas, too.

17:43.165 --> 17:48.833
Some of them were pretty reluctant, but I told them that they had to do it.

17:50.074 --> 17:51.416
You mean in other summers?

17:51.917 --> 17:52.177
Yeah.

17:52.357 --> 17:53.519
Similar classes?

17:54.180 --> 17:54.280
Yeah.

17:54.648 --> 18:02.642
How did, in terms of the academics, was there any problem that those students had in the summer class at all?

18:04.325 --> 18:12.218
One student had some problems with one of the courses, but other students

18:16.737 --> 18:29.456
See, we used to teach astronomy and oceanography and meteorology and geology, or science, we called it.

18:30.337 --> 18:34.223
So, these would alternate, and we generally have

18:34.203 --> 18:38.248
two courses the first six weeks and two the second.

18:39.349 --> 18:48.881
And some people were admitted for both terms and some for the first six weeks and some for the second, depending upon their background.

18:48.901 --> 18:53.547
So, no, I had more problems probably later on.

18:57.091 --> 18:59.434
There was a general tendency

19:01.591 --> 19:07.540
among some of the blacks to not want to outdo any other black in the class.

19:09.423 --> 19:15.051
So as a result, you can see what that would do to grades.

19:15.071 --> 19:19.057
Did you ever speak to any of the black students about that to try to?

19:19.698 --> 19:19.978
No.

19:21.761 --> 19:26.468
That summer where those first two were,

19:27.359 --> 19:32.147
Were there any black students enrolled anywhere else that summer at A&M?

19:32.167 --> 19:37.756
Yeah, there was one student from Prairie View that needed some other courses he could get here.

19:38.397 --> 19:42.765
And when he saw it in the paper, he'd come up to see if they'd admit him for the summer.

19:42.845 --> 19:43.746
So there were three.

19:43.806 --> 19:44.828
And there were three.

19:45.529 --> 19:49.255
So there were two in my program and one undergraduate.

19:50.017 --> 19:50.437
Okay.

19:51.178 --> 19:53.923
Because I think it was the next summer

19:54.427 --> 20:06.125
that we had a number of Army enlisted men sent here by the Department of the Army, and that then began integration generally.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.130
But I think that was then.

20:09.991 --> 20:14.097
Did you, and you had women in these summer courses, of course.

20:14.177 --> 20:14.979
Yes, always.

20:16.120 --> 20:20.367
And the, well, there used to be more

20:21.359 --> 20:25.444
male teachers teaching the middle school than there are now.

20:26.105 --> 20:30.990
So that the first programs would have maybe 90% men.

20:31.831 --> 20:35.596
Now it's 90% women.

20:35.616 --> 20:37.598
The other way around if you have a program.

20:38.219 --> 20:41.262
Now you've been doing this all these summers since then?

20:41.903 --> 20:44.206
From 1960 up through 96.

20:46.148 --> 20:49.031
With a few years where I didn't have a program.

20:49.552 --> 20:50.353
How did

20:50.840 --> 20:52.871
Describe how it changed.

20:53.374 --> 20:58.099
What changes were in that program during that 30 years?

21:02.129 --> 21:03.571
Well, let me just say this.

21:03.691 --> 21:14.867
The topics change a lot because you have to remember earth science is a field where we're finding out something new every day, particularly astronomy.

21:15.828 --> 21:18.832
And so this keeps changing all the time.

21:19.934 --> 21:30.769
And we started to emphasize the fact that when you teach something,

21:32.318 --> 21:34.741
You can do it better if you've seen it.

21:37.745 --> 21:44.434
And so that was one of the philosophies that you, in order to teach it, you have to see it.

21:47.378 --> 21:52.105
And there has been a change in NSF towards more innovative things.

21:52.145 --> 21:59.575
They forget that most of the teachers that are selected as these students,

22:00.837 --> 22:04.201
by the Presidential Award for Teachers that goes on.

22:04.641 --> 22:08.045
Most of them are products of the Summer Institute program.

22:10.388 --> 22:14.953
Now, geographically, did you continue to draw teachers from about the same area?

22:14.973 --> 22:18.056
Well, in the beginning, it was nationwide.

22:18.337 --> 22:18.537
Oh.

22:19.598 --> 22:26.706
And the last ones have been from Texas because they got to where they were more provincial.

22:26.766 --> 22:28.448
They wanted them more provincial.

22:29.508 --> 22:33.072
And was there a good mix between urban and rural?

22:35.535 --> 22:36.476
Schools represented?

22:36.496 --> 22:38.518
We took whatever the applicants were.

22:38.558 --> 22:39.619
We didn't try to.

22:39.679 --> 22:42.042
No, but I mean in terms of the applications.

22:42.202 --> 22:42.903
Yeah, generally.

22:43.003 --> 22:43.984
There was a good blend?

22:44.484 --> 22:47.247
Yeah, there was a good mix.

22:47.267 --> 22:52.593
Because Van Horn isn't a very big place.

22:52.613 --> 22:57.118
What were some of the most difficult topics for you all to get across to them?

22:57.959 --> 23:09.034
What did they understand most easily and most... Well, you always have a few people that don't believe in evolution.

23:09.055 --> 23:09.575
Ah, okay.

23:10.497 --> 23:16.265
And, of course, I always start off, one, I believe there is a God.

23:17.727 --> 23:23.575
I believe that the rules for evolution are set up by the God.

23:24.316 --> 23:24.456
Mm-hmm.

23:24.942 --> 23:30.127
And therefore, faith is a search for the truth, and so is science.

23:32.690 --> 23:38.156
And if we do a good job of it, relatively, we'll get to the same place.

23:38.516 --> 23:40.558
Did you ever have anybody challenge you on that?

23:41.279 --> 23:41.499
No.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.563
Really?

23:44.583 --> 23:51.650
But we have had people in our beginning of geology class, the historical one, challenge the props on it.

23:51.790 --> 23:53.532
Really?

23:55.317 --> 24:14.254
But see, it turned out that the fellow that started off by saying that humans were present with dinosaurs from the tracks up at Glen Rose, and I've seen those so-called human tracks,

24:14.318 --> 24:16.842
They're just the result of water erosion.

24:17.303 --> 24:22.351
He finally admitted that he thought they weren't human drugs either.

24:24.173 --> 24:34.670
So that a lot of the evidence they use is... All right, so evolution is a reality in geology.

24:34.770 --> 24:35.972
What are some other...

24:36.627 --> 24:44.019
of the most difficult or the most discussed topics in geology in general?

24:44.039 --> 24:52.253
Well, plate tectonics is one that most students have a little difficulty understanding.

24:53.595 --> 24:55.598
In other words, the earth that we're on

24:58.531 --> 25:01.757
They don't see it in three dimensions.

25:02.037 --> 25:10.373
And essentially, we know there are segments of the earth that move.

25:10.393 --> 25:13.799
Otherwise, we wouldn't have earthquakes.

25:13.819 --> 25:18.227
And we get some very difficult ones.

25:28.282 --> 25:34.148
I guess when I was doing my Ph.D.

25:34.208 --> 25:38.252
dissertation, those were the days when I smoked.

25:38.312 --> 25:46.680
And it's a wonder that I don't have lung cancer or this, but I've been very fortunate.

25:49.343 --> 25:52.366
My doctor says you've got to quit smoking, so I did.

25:53.847 --> 25:55.909
Let's talk about smoking a second.

25:56.682 --> 26:02.590
In general, did your colleagues also smoke in those years, in the 50s and 60s?

26:03.371 --> 26:03.551
Yes, yes.

26:03.571 --> 26:05.714
And what were you all smoking generally?

26:05.734 --> 26:07.737
What kinds of cigarettes?

26:07.757 --> 26:10.681
Well, I smoked mentholated ones then.

26:10.701 --> 26:15.227
But I also smoked cigars, smoked a pipe.

26:15.708 --> 26:16.909
I always had something going.

26:17.530 --> 26:19.753
And you smoked in your office?

26:20.634 --> 26:21.055
Oh, yes.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.900
Did any of your colleagues smoke in the classroom?

26:25.589 --> 26:26.770
We weren't supposed to.

26:28.032 --> 26:30.114
But did anybody do it, as far as you remember?

26:31.816 --> 26:35.520
Clay sewer might have, I don't know.

26:35.540 --> 26:43.029
Because I think I remember some faculty members smoking in seminars, you know, sitting at the table.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.494
Certainly when I was a graduate student at Rice, we had some people that did that.

26:51.919 --> 26:54.702
But I remember faculty members' offices

26:55.643 --> 27:00.830
it was normal for there to be an ashtray everywhere.

27:01.631 --> 27:07.039
And how many packs a day were you smoking?

27:07.079 --> 27:07.299
Two.

27:11.104 --> 27:23.862
No, and then the difficult thing was, after I'd quit smoking, I was in the hospital for something, and my doctor came in, the one that told me not to quit smoking.

27:26.542 --> 27:27.403
Dwight Andres.

27:28.465 --> 27:29.807
Andres?

27:29.827 --> 27:30.828
Yeah, Dwight.

27:32.611 --> 27:34.153
He just died recently.

27:35.816 --> 27:41.825
And this is the last place he visited.

27:42.566 --> 27:50.017
Sat down, pulled out his pipe, smoked.

27:50.037 --> 27:55.485
Now, I sort of refused to go to a hospital

27:56.208 --> 27:58.611
that doesn't have a non-smoking sign.

27:58.631 --> 28:15.672
During that era, in those years here, where did you and your wife and other couples, what did you all do for relaxation and entertainment?

28:15.693 --> 28:19.738
Where did you go to party or to eat and so forth, to relax?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.262
Well, you remember the Grove?

28:25.418 --> 28:29.664
I've even gone there to see movies in the summer.

28:29.684 --> 28:30.285
In the summer.

28:30.685 --> 28:43.983
And I remember they even put on a musical there one summer.

28:44.003 --> 28:45.626
I don't know where they got the talent.

28:48.610 --> 28:51.614
Where did you— Was Guyon Hall here when you— Oh, yes.

28:51.954 --> 28:52.455
Oh, yes.

28:53.093 --> 28:54.395
Sure.

28:54.415 --> 28:58.439
It's in the site of the rudder building.

28:58.459 --> 29:02.984
Well, I've even gone to see movies in Guy and Hall.

29:05.067 --> 29:09.872
Of course, you had the core in here in Guy and Hall going to see the movie, too.

29:12.435 --> 29:15.078
And it could be pretty noisy, couldn't it, with the core?

29:15.779 --> 29:16.120
Yes.

29:16.140 --> 29:18.442
And then they used to show that one.

29:19.003 --> 29:19.944
We've never been licked.

29:20.264 --> 29:20.805
Yes.

29:22.186 --> 29:28.156
That would be shown about every other time there were movies, so I've seen it several times.

29:28.897 --> 29:32.223
Where did y'all go eat if you're going to eat out, going to dine out?

29:38.153 --> 29:46.607
Well, the Whataburger came in before McDonald's did.

29:47.887 --> 30:01.269
Earlier in the 60s, in order, because of doing the research and the research field coming into town, I did join the country club, Briarcrest.

30:01.570 --> 30:01.971
Okay.

30:03.093 --> 30:06.658
So we normally— You'd take company out there.

30:06.719 --> 30:07.059
Yeah.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.585
And then did you ever go to the Texan?

30:12.468 --> 30:12.949
Yeah.

30:16.186 --> 30:36.107
Well, in the early days, you know, after he just decided to quit teaching physics and go to... As coeducation and integration began on the campus, how did that affect your classes?

30:36.447 --> 30:43.915
Do you remember the early days when they were the first women and the first blacks in the fall and spring semester?

30:46.342 --> 30:52.231
Well, I remember I had a couple of blacks, very bright too, but I don't know.

30:52.272 --> 30:54.415
They never finished up here.

30:54.515 --> 30:55.717
I don't know where they finished.

30:55.777 --> 31:03.990
They were in the petroleum engineering course for geologists, so I don't know what happened to them.

31:04.211 --> 31:09.379
In those early years, do you remember any problems black students encountered in class?

31:12.683 --> 31:14.171
Like I never heard of any, did you?

31:14.252 --> 31:15.277
No, I haven't either.

31:15.640 --> 31:20.044
And I would, well,
