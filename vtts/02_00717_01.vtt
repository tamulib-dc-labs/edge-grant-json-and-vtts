00:02.866 --> 00:19.243
whatever you can remember of your childhood, 
including the names of your parents, places and

00:02.866 --> 00:19.243
dates of birth and death if you know them, things of 
that nature, the schools you attended before

00:02.866 --> 00:19.243
going to college and something of that nature. I 
was born in Nashville, Tennessee on July 16th,

00:20.024 --> 00:29.734
1904.

00:31.132 --> 00:40.482
My father was William Abbott, and my mother was 
Eleanor Ryan Abbott. My father died when I was very

00:40.502 --> 00:42.984
young. As I

00:43.004 --> 00:47.549
recall, it was 1910. But my mother lived to be about 
93 and retained her health, I'm happy to say, all of

00:49.611 --> 00:59.181
that time. And she stayed on in Nashville, 
although I came to Texas and never left Texas after

00:59.802 --> 01:08.372
I did come here. I came in 1926. Now, before that, I 
attended the public schools in Nashville. The

01:20.245 --> 01:29.556
grade school I attended from the first grade up to 
the eighth was called Howard School in South

01:20.245 --> 01:29.556
Nashville. I think it may still be in existence, 
although I'm not sure whether it's an active

01:30.025 --> 01:35.794
school or not. The high school I attended was 
Hume-Fogg, which at that time was the only high

01:35.814 --> 01:46.651
school in Nashville, although I think there was a 
county high school called Central. Of course, now

01:48.674 --> 01:56.927
there are any number of high schools there, and I 
think it has become a special high school I'm not

01:58.223 --> 02:04.029
sure what it does specialize in, but I think it is a 
special purpose high school now. I went to, from

02:05.711 --> 02:19.606
there, I went to Vanderbilt and went five years 
there, the four undergraduate years and one

02:05.711 --> 02:19.606
graduate year. Although I did not take my 
master's, I did have the graduate year in

02:20.947 --> 02:28.095
philosophy, but I was already pretty sure that 
what I wanted to do was English language and

02:28.700 --> 02:40.816
literature, and I suspect that's why I did not 
finish the master's in philosophy. Your

02:41.277 --> 02:42.658
undergraduate degree? My undergraduate work was 
psychology and philosophy. Was psychology and

02:45.482 --> 02:46.804
philosophy? Yes. Well, the department was a 
combined department of psychology and

02:47.385 --> 02:51.931
philosophy. I suppose, technically, I was a 
philosophy major. although I had as many

02:58.130 --> 03:03.655
psychology courses as were offered in the 
combined department. Where does the English come

03:04.777 --> 03:05.878
in? Was that a minor? It was a minor and a very full 
minor, as a matter of fact. I had about as many

03:10.842 --> 03:15.627
English courses as I had philosophy and 
psychology courses. And, well, this may be of

03:16.808 --> 03:22.414
interest to some people. I was in Vanderbilt. At 
the time, the very famous fugitive group of poets

03:26.564 --> 03:43.252
was there, and while I was only on the fringe and 
attended only a few of their meetings, many of them

03:26.564 --> 03:43.252
were personal friends of mine. Robert Penn 
Warren, and will I'm sure be known to most people,

03:43.933 --> 03:52.167
John Crowe Ransom, who was a teacher of mine, and 
Walter Clyde Curry, a teacher of mine. You notice

03:57.346 --> 04:03.734
they both are teachers in the Department of 
English, rather than in the Department of

03:57.346 --> 04:03.734
Philosophy. The Department of Philosophy, as a 
matter of fact, was a one-man department. It was

04:09.441 --> 04:22.356
Dr. Sanborn, who had been German trained,

04:09.441 --> 04:22.356
and was really a very fine person. and an excellent 
teacher.

04:29.474 --> 04:32.017
You mentioned this fugitive group of poets. In 
what way were they a fugitive group?

04:37.544 --> 04:41.528
I'm not sure what they were fleeing from.

04:45.433 --> 04:52.782
Some of them called themselves unreconstructed 
southerners and a number of them were of what they

04:53.403 --> 04:57.647
called themselves agrarians.

05:01.150 --> 05:08.297
I'm not too sure of what they were, but also 
Jeffersonian in the agrarian sense. But it was a

05:08.317 --> 05:22.650
happenstance that they all were either on the 
faculty at Vanderbilt or were students at

05:08.317 --> 05:22.650
Vanderbilt or were very closely associated with 
faculty and students. at Vanderbilt. Of course, a

05:24.922 --> 05:35.577
number of them went on to make

05:24.922 --> 05:35.577
international reputations for themselves, even 
when the fugitive group itself broke up. I suspect

05:36.578 --> 05:44.289
our library has a full file of the fugitive, the 
actual fugitive poems.

05:47.593 --> 05:52.620
Oh well, some others in the group were Alan Tate and 
Oh, Wills, Ridley Wills, I remember, was in the

05:54.372 --> 05:57.656
group. And Donald Davidson, I mentioned, I 
believe, Walter Clyde Curry was a member of the

05:59.619 --> 06:09.491
group. Well, of course, that was very stimulating 
to students, and I'm not at all sure that it didn't

06:10.333 --> 06:19.444
influence me also to shift over into language and 
literature. I was fortunate enough to... and be

06:25.169 --> 06:30.794
elected to Fabio DiCaprio at Vanderbilt.

06:33.216 --> 06:41.984
And at that time I was, and had been for several 
years, a counselor at a YMCA boys camp. And it was at

06:44.146 --> 06:53.775
the camp that I received an offer to come to Texas 
A&M in the Department of English.

06:54.650 --> 07:00.116
I went back to Vanderbilt and talked to my dean and 
asked him what I should do. Texas seemed a long way

07:00.217 --> 07:01.738
off. And he advised me to go and try, see whether I 
liked it or not. So I accepted. Had you applied for a

07:09.247 --> 07:12.311
position here? No, no. I suspect that my name, all 
from the dean's office, was probably made

07:20.873 --> 07:26.601
available to a number of places, but I had not 
applied anywhere. I was at the camp that summer

07:26.621 --> 07:30.446
when the offer came. The amusing thing is that the 
offer was for $1,800 for nine months a year. Three

07:40.119 --> 07:48.670
days later, I got an offer from the Citadel over in 
Carolina for $1,900. And although $100 doesn't

07:49.662 --> 07:54.106
seem like very much, it did then. But I had 
committed myself, and so I had to turn down the

07:54.126 --> 08:00.773
citadel offer. And by way of coincidence, the man 
whose place I took at A&M, and this is, I'm sure, how

08:00.793 --> 08:18.910
Dr. Summey, Dr. George Summey, who was head of the 
department, I'm sure that's how he found out about

08:00.793 --> 08:18.910
me. was Professor Bryce Harris, and when I got 
here, I discovered that he had taken the job at the

08:19.210 --> 08:31.946
Citadel that I had been offered, so our paths 
crossed. He had been a graduate student at

08:32.727 --> 08:37.193
Vanderbilt a year ahead of me. So you think it 
perhaps was on his recommendation? I suspect so,

08:41.158 --> 08:47.867
yes, because Dr. Samuel would have had no way of 
knowing anything about it, and I had been in a a

08:47.982 --> 08:52.107
couple of classes with Bryce Harris. I was curious 
as to how a native Tennessean had arrived at

08:52.227 --> 08:57.114
College Station, Texas in 1925. In 26. 26. And 
you've answered that. You mentioned that Texas

09:03.101 --> 09:10.831
was a long way from Tennessee and you had some 
perhaps misgivings about going so far away from

09:03.101 --> 09:10.831
home. What were your first reactions when you 
arrived in town? Let me be sure that now I am being

09:16.332 --> 09:20.977
straightforward. Actually, I think I started 
enjoying myself from the moment I landed,

09:22.318 --> 09:38.915
although it was on a very hot September day, and I 
had to walk from the railroad station to the old

09:22.318 --> 09:38.915
bachelor club where I had a room. And I... Met Bryce 
Harris there. He had not left yet for the Citadel. I

09:50.466 --> 09:54.049
met several of the people who were staying in the 
old bachelor club. And I think I really started

09:54.470 --> 09:57.453
liking it almost immediately. And while I 
originally had thought I might stay here for a year

09:58.294 --> 10:07.564
or so to get a little experience in seasoning, I 
never looked back.

10:10.868 --> 10:12.850
For how long did you stay in the bachelor club? I

10:15.074 --> 10:44.642
think about three years and then five of us who had 
been in the bachelor club rented an apartment at

10:15.074 --> 10:44.642
the north gate the apartments are still there at 
stucco building we rented an apartment and hired a

10:15.074 --> 10:44.642
cook to take care of us for two years let me see now if 
I can count up 26 I married in 31 So that would be the

10:45.584 --> 10:53.794
last two years before I married were with the five 
in the apartment. And one of them is still here in

10:53.814 --> 11:02.345
retirement, Alvin Zeller. Alvin Zeller, I think, 
was in our sanitary engineering department. Now,

11:07.512 --> 11:11.797
he was in the apartment in the bachelor club with 
you? Yes. life like in a bachelor club, and what

11:13.597 --> 11:17.682
sorts of things could you do for... Very, it was 
very pleasant. It

11:19.765 --> 11:36.006
was also a boarding house, and while it was on 
college property, the dining room was run by a

11:19.765 --> 11:36.006
private person. It was not a college, at that time 
it was a college, not a college facility, but Mrs.

11:41.002 --> 11:47.069
Boyd ran the dining room. It was an excellent 
dining room. We all enjoyed it. In fact, for a

11:50.833 --> 11:57.941
while, after we took the apartment, before we 
found our own cook, we still boarded with her. And

11:57.961 --> 12:00.164
was this the Boyd family that had the store? Yes, 
yes. There's still some of the Boyds, a number of

12:02.867 --> 12:05.550
the Boyds still here.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.215
They lived just across... from the campus at that 
time. I believe they had a store that was right

12:14.636 --> 12:21.324
across from about where the post office is, across 
the university's drive.

12:23.888 --> 12:28.593
And so did the people who lived in the bachelor club 
then own the building? No. Or you rented it from the

12:29.234 --> 12:31.577
college? No. We rented a room. Each individual 
rented a room. I'm not sure how many rooms. I'm

12:37.744 --> 12:40.928
guessing there must have been around 30 rooms in 
it. It had been a wartime building, that is, World

12:41.380 --> 12:55.515
War I, but nothing, of course, is more permanent 
than a temporary building, and it was still there,

12:41.380 --> 12:55.515
still a sound building. So the building was owned 
by the college? It was owned by the college, yes.

12:59.580 --> 13:04.605
And faculty members, I presume all faculty, they 
were all faculty members living there? Yes, all of

13:04.825 --> 13:07.168
them were faculty members.

13:10.152 --> 13:12.334
You mentioned about eating. In the Bachelor Club, 
what types of things could you do for

13:12.514 --> 13:21.422
entertainment and recreation? Oh, there was an 
almost perpetual bridge game going on every

13:22.083 --> 13:27.628
night. And I remember that we had three or four 
dedicated

13:29.650 --> 13:38.218
domino players and a couple of dedicated chess 
players and uh let's see what oh and a good many

13:39.498 --> 14:04.797
played golf

13:39.498 --> 14:04.797
where did you play golf at that point it was called 
the country club then it is the present brown

13:39.498 --> 14:04.797
municipal course

13:39.498 --> 14:04.797
any any other kind of physical activities other 
than golf that uh yes i uh My sport, if I can be said to

14:06.228 --> 14:10.652
have had a sport, was tennis. And I played a great 
deal of tennis. I was fortunate enough to have as a

14:14.015 --> 14:29.850
friend the then coach of tennis, who was a member of 
the Department of English,

14:14.015 --> 14:29.850
Mr. William Thomas. And so he would let me play with 
team members. And, of course, I thoroughly

14:36.417 --> 14:38.299
enjoyed that. And as a matter of fact, when Mr. 
Thomas died in 1935, very suddenly, I took over as

14:38.319 --> 14:56.260
coach, and I coached the tennis team then until I 
went off to Iowa to do complete work on my

14:38.319 --> 14:56.260
doctorate. That was about three years. At that 
time, did you have any, say, when you went to coach

14:58.643 --> 15:03.589
tennis, Did you have any reduction in your 
teaching load, or did you get additional pay for

15:04.008 --> 15:08.055
coaching? Never dreamed of asking. It was just 
fun. It was fun. You got to play tennis along with

15:11.921 --> 15:16.909
the team members then when you coached. Okay. You 
mentioned that in 31 you married. Did you then move

15:22.038 --> 15:26.345
on to the campus in a faculty home, or where did you 
live?

15:29.170 --> 15:30.572
For the first... couple of months or so we lived in 
that same apartment house an apartment became

15:32.493 --> 16:01.808
vacant and we lived in it but but we had been 
building our own home a little home out in college

15:32.493 --> 16:01.808
park it's the home we have now it was not ready when 
we married because they'd been very bad weather

15:32.493 --> 16:01.808
that fall it was supposed to have been ready when we 
married on the 23rd of december but it was not ready

16:02.902 --> 16:04.805
for several weeks after that. We lived in an 
apartment. We were lucky enough to get this

16:06.067 --> 16:09.052
apartment for that time. But at that point a goodly 
number of the faculty were living in houses on the

16:09.072 --> 16:12.978
campus, were they not? A good many were living, 
particularly senior members of the faculty, were

16:13.459 --> 16:20.250
living on campus. So then you've lived in the same 
residence from Early 32, I take it, until today.

16:29.407 --> 16:33.231
Until today, yeah.

16:34.052 --> 16:36.796
You came here as an instructor from Vanderbilt in 
26. And

16:38.518 --> 16:42.923
you taught English. Do you remember what courses 
you taught at that point? Almost exclusively

16:46.247 --> 16:55.217
freshman courses because for many, many years, as 
I'm sure you know, the department of english like

16:56.108 --> 17:24.681
history and economics and modern languages was a 
service department that is it we didn't even have

16:56.108 --> 17:24.681
majors for a long time much less candidates for the 
doctorate he existed to provide electives for the

16:56.108 --> 17:24.681
other departments so mostly freshmen but uh or 
maybe one or two sections of a sophomore course.

17:28.411 --> 17:32.377
And at that time, the loads were regularly 15 
hours. So you might have five sections. I would

17:35.862 --> 17:37.044
have five sections. And the chances are there 
would be three or four sections of freshman and one

17:37.745 --> 17:45.337
or two sections of sophomore. And freshman 
English then was somewhat like today, grammar,

17:45.357 --> 17:48.802
primarily? Primarily. And sophomores would be 
what, American literature? No. what I guess they

17:54.125 --> 18:03.920
would call today types, like the essay, poems, 
novel, and a play or two. I think it would be

18:03.960 --> 18:07.585
probably called a types course. So kind of an 
introduction to the various types of literature.

18:10.670 --> 18:20.044
And then there was another sophomore course 
called argumentation, which was the first course

18:10.670 --> 18:20.044
was the literature of types course. And the second 
semester in the sophomore year, was

18:23.740 --> 18:27.564
argumentation.

18:27.584 --> 18:37.155
And almost all students took the four semesters, 
plus a one-hour course in the senior year in public

18:27.584 --> 18:37.155
speaking. And that was changed, of course, later. 
But at that time, that was almost universal, that

18:40.338 --> 18:51.911
you could count on every Aggie having freshman 
English, two semesters of sophomore English, and

18:40.338 --> 18:51.911
one speech course. One speech course. In the 
senior year. Well, perhaps that was when he needed

18:55.448 --> 18:59.833
it the most.

19:01.175 --> 19:06.661
I believe you rose to the rank of assistant 
professor in something like three years. Was that

19:06.701 --> 19:11.386
a normal

19:06.701 --> 19:11.386
period at that point? Honestly, I don't know. Then 
you notice there was a long gap. A long gap before

19:17.894 --> 19:23.160
you made associate professor, but then only one 
year an associate professor up to full. Yes, but I

19:23.478 --> 19:27.172
had nothing but a bachelor's degree at that time. 
You mean? See, I had had a graduate year, but I did

19:29.421 --> 19:32.633
not take my master's degree. You came here with a 
bachelor's. Yeah. You mentioned leaving here to

19:36.218 --> 19:41.185
go to Iowa for a graduate to work on your doctorate. 
What year was that? 37. 37. So that was shortly

19:44.230 --> 19:50.439
before you rose to the associate professor. Yeah, 
and I got my degree in 39. Uh-huh. And had you been

19:55.006 --> 19:56.928
taking summer courses? I had taken summer courses 
one summer at... The University of Wisconsin at

20:03.725 --> 20:07.472
Madison and another at Tulane in New Orleans. And 
then you had one full year at... And one full year at

20:09.074 --> 20:13.121
Vanderbilt before I came. Oh, you mean at Iowa. 
Well, I took leave for the academic year 1937-38. I

20:22.257 --> 20:26.104
came back for the year 38-39 but went up there in the 
summer and finished up in the summer of 39. So in a

20:33.041 --> 20:37.488
sense you went uh you never did receive a master's 
degree then. Never did. Just went from the

20:38.028 --> 20:45.119
bachelor's and one year of graduate school then on 
into a doctorate program. Not not very many places

20:45.139 --> 20:48.583
would allow you to do that today I would think. Uh 
not many people do it. I don't know how many places

20:52.649 --> 20:54.572
would uh Say you can't do it. I think most people 
like to have a crack at you at a master's term. Well,

21:00.798 --> 21:06.425
now... And if you can make it, then they let you go on 
for a doctorate. Well, I had to take the qualifying

21:06.906 --> 21:14.196
examination, which would have been the same thing 
as you would have done if you had the master's. I

21:15.077 --> 21:18.481
didn't just say start out and go on to the 
doctorate. You had a qualifying examination.

21:21.282 --> 21:22.684
This was at Iowa. Yes. And you took that, what, 
after you'd already had two summers elsewhere, I

21:24.888 --> 21:33.401
take it?

21:33.421 --> 21:33.621
Yes. Now, the graduate college at Iowa was very, 
very considerate, and the graduate college did

21:33.641 --> 21:47.543
let me take my final examinations much earlier 
than would be normal. And I'm sure that very few

21:51.564 --> 21:54.227
universities would do it. But the then dean of the 
graduate college who was started later became, I

21:55.168 --> 22:10.384
think, president of the Consolidated University 
of New York and then Illinois. And it was his theory

22:12.326 --> 22:17.091
that if I wanted to take the chance, Well, he would 
let me take the chance, so I wanted to take the

22:17.813 --> 22:34.810
chance, and did, after only, I

22:17.813 --> 22:34.810
think I took it, I did take it, the summer of 38. So I 
was in there barely a year when I took my final

22:35.228 --> 22:38.912
examination. I believe today, I can remember when 
I had mine, I had to have taken a specified number of

22:40.333 --> 22:47.121
hours beforehand. And there was really no way you 
could do that in one year.

22:55.330 --> 23:02.858
I believe you mentioned that Dr. Sumi was head of 
the English department when you came. Was he a

23:03.398 --> 23:05.100
pretty good man to work under? One of the finest men 
I ever knew in my life. For how long then did he stay

23:08.926 --> 23:12.831
on as head of our chairman of the English 
department?

23:15.394 --> 23:19.520
You probably have more accurate dates than this. 
It was a number of years until I think he just plain

23:19.540 --> 23:27.330
got tired of administration and asked to be 
relieved. He did want to stay on with his teaching

23:27.370 --> 23:32.657
and did stay on and then The one who followed him was 
also our head librarian at the time, Thomas R.

23:33.177 --> 23:38.305
Mayo. Well, I've heard lots of people say lots of 
good things about Dr. Mayo. They were both very

23:44.074 --> 23:45.516
fine people.

23:48.901 --> 23:58.415
I think Dr. Summey inspired the kind of loyalty 
that you rarely find in an individual. I know of no

24:00.519 --> 24:02.121
one who served under him who would not say the same 
thing.

24:09.336 --> 24:30.505
I think it was his marvelous character that, 
although he was himself an excellent student of

24:09.336 --> 24:30.505
language, and his book on punctuation is, I 
suspect, still the standard book, although Dr.

24:09.336 --> 24:30.505
Summey has been dead several years now, and his 
revised version of that book or must be 15 years

24:31.193 --> 24:33.276
old. But it is still, I think, the standard work on 
punctuation.

24:39.385 --> 24:57.032
Over the years that you were in the English 
department and in various other positions, was

24:39.385 --> 24:57.032
there a discernible difference in relationship 
between, say, incoming faculty members and the

24:39.385 --> 24:57.032
department head, or did that...

24:59.881 --> 25:08.810
Were the department heads continuing to stay 
close to all of their faculty members as the size of

24:59.881 --> 25:08.810
the faculty increased, do you think? Or was there 
almost necessary, in a sense, separation because

25:08.830 --> 25:16.358
the departments became fairly sizable? Well, 
they didn't become fairly sizable for a number of

25:16.819 --> 25:20.703
years. In fact, the department was fairly stable. 
I would say remarkably stable. until

25:28.923 --> 25:33.147
the war years. And that was when the growth began, 
tremendous growth, of course. I remember that Dr.

25:41.554 --> 25:53.584
Mayo, I think, had to fill, I

25:41.554 --> 25:53.584
hope I'm not exaggerating, 12 or 15 positions for 
one fall. And we had a little indigestion at that

25:59.213 --> 26:04.299
time because we greatly increased the size of the 
department. Of course, that bulge

26:04.319 --> 26:16.433
was short-lived because we didn't start our real 
growth for a number of years after that. We went up

26:16.853 --> 26:20.477
to about 9,000, I think, immediately after the 
war. Then we fell back down to, what, around six?

26:24.382 --> 26:24.982
Something like that. Something like that. My 
memory is not that accurate. And then we just

26:29.858 --> 26:31.500
slowly grew. It's only within the last three or 
four years, of course, that we've had this...

26:31.841 --> 26:37.448
Really ballooned. Almost an explosion.

26:42.394 --> 26:50.325
I believe I had this right in 47, you were moved up to 
an assistant to the dean and head of the basic

26:42.394 --> 26:50.325
division.

26:53.048 --> 26:55.411
What was the goal of the basic division? Well, it 
was... It was a necessity, as a matter of fact. We

27:02.199 --> 27:09.389
simply did not have room on campus for all the 
freshmen. I mean, for all students. And so the

27:11.191 --> 27:13.654
decision was made in 47. I did not go in 47. But Dr. 
Harrington, M.T. Harrington, who later became

27:19.522 --> 27:22.326
president and chancellor, He was asked to go out 
and establish an annex in what had been the Air

27:24.145 --> 27:40.669
Force Base, around the Air Force Base, which is 
presently our research center, as you know. And he

27:40.689 --> 27:43.072
did start it. And it was the next year that I went, 
when he was asked to become Dean of Arts and

27:43.713 --> 27:54.068
Sciences,

27:43.713 --> 27:54.068
Dean Bolton, who was the executive dean. The title 
was dean of the college, but it meant executive

27:57.676 --> 28:08.186
dean, equivalent today, I think, of executive 
vice president, or academic vice president,

27:57.676 --> 28:08.186
probably.

28:10.488 --> 28:16.294
Asked me if I would go out and take charge of the 
annex, and I did, and had a marvelous time. And I was

28:17.635 --> 28:24.021
there myself only from 48 until December of 1949, 
when I followed Dr. Harrington as Dean of Arts and

28:24.473 --> 28:30.342
Sciences. When he became Dean of the College, or 
the Executive Dean. But for those nearly two

28:35.410 --> 28:40.758
years, I had a very fine time. So, it was a out of 
necessity for space. Oh, yes. At least a portion of

28:47.508 --> 28:50.492
the student body. You were asking about the basic 
division. It was not at first thought of really as

28:52.274 --> 28:55.439
the basic division. It was just a way of taking care 
of students. But the students did so well out

28:58.523 --> 29:12.823
there, the freshmen who were out there, did so well 
that it seemed a good idea to preserve the freshmen

28:58.523 --> 29:12.823
as a separate unit. And

29:14.322 --> 29:23.832
this was done even when room became available on 
the campus again, and they were, the freshmen were

29:14.322 --> 29:23.832
moved. You have a record of this. I don't remember, 
was it 50? When they came back to the campus, when

29:31.940 --> 29:35.624
the freshmen were moved back to the campus. I don't 
remember right offhand what it was. But then it

29:37.866 --> 29:43.452
became an administrative unit on campus, and... 
at its director on campus, who was John Bertrand,

29:44.528 --> 29:50.098
who had succeeded me.

29:54.566 --> 30:03.201
And the basic division then remained a working 
division for a good many years after that. So it was

30:04.964 --> 30:07.228
a, it was kind of a special help For freshmen? Yes. 
Even after it was not a physical necessity? Yeah.

30:12.315 --> 30:15.019
The freshmen were all administered in this. That 
is, the grades were kept there, the counseling was

30:15.039 --> 30:18.604
done there. Were they registered separately? 
Yeah,

30:23.951 --> 30:34.144
well,

30:23.951 --> 30:34.144
actually they were, of course, after that first 
year. They went with their major department, as

30:34.732 --> 30:38.363
they do now.
