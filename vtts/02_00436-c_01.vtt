WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:03.523
nurse. Yeah, they were married and she had, I think 
she was about maybe two months pregnant, but this

00:04.164 --> 00:16.104
was not known. I didn't know it when he told me. I was 
shocked. I was shocked. I didn't know. I was

00:20.351 --> 00:20.992
surprised. And so was Bob Neal. And it so happens 
that old PTAC And he was one of the 16 that

00:27.335 --> 00:31.840
volunteered to stay over those extra 10 days. And 
he was killed. Oh, I see. He was killed. And it was

00:36.764 --> 00:42.630
either 16 of us for 10 days or 10 of us for 16 days. I 
forget which. At any rate, he was one of the eight

00:46.334 --> 00:57.325
pilots I told you originally about that was killed 
in combat, actually killed in the entire AVG

00:46.334 --> 00:57.325
history. Anyway, she was pregnant, and they sort 
of wanted us to look after her. Well, Red sort of

01:03.108 --> 01:10.657
took care of me in a hospital, you know, and bathed 
me when I was, you know, had come back and shot down

01:03.108 --> 01:10.657
and all that. So I had developed a close rapport 
with her. And my first reaction, of course, to Bob

01:13.801 --> 01:18.286
Neal, too, was the rapport with her. We just loved 
those nurses. And, you know, there were only two

01:19.648 --> 01:22.091
females with her. And... We said, sure. But I said, 
you know, we don't know how we're going to get home.

01:28.157 --> 01:29.239
We're going down to India. And I told him I'm going 
to try my best to pull strings in the 10th Air Force

01:29.299 --> 01:37.691
Headquarters of New Delhi to get air 
transportation back home. I don't know. I'm not

01:38.332 --> 01:40.375
even going home on a slow boat. I'm not afraid about 
submarines, but I just don't want to do that. So he

01:42.919 --> 01:44.161
said, yeah. So he told Red. And we three had come in 
then, got on an airplane, provided by the old man.

01:53.920 --> 02:00.826
got us to CNAC, Chinese National Airways 
Corporation, which was really the Chinese

01:53.920 --> 02:00.826
airline. And he was boss of that, too. So that got us 
to Calcutta. So Calcutta, we were on our own from

02:05.651 --> 02:09.555
then on. And we three stayed together all the way 
home. To make a long story short- How'd you get

02:14.159 --> 02:17.022
home? I knew General Caldwell, Colonel Caldwell 
at that time. And Colonel,

02:23.266 --> 02:38.769
I had to refer to my diary notes,

02:23.266 --> 02:38.769
he later became a four-star general in the Air 
Force and personnel. And General

02:38.789 --> 02:51.467
Nagel, who was commander, brigadier general in 
the United States Army Air Corps, 10th Air Force

02:38.789 --> 02:51.467
with headquarters in New Delhi. General Peabody, 
General Peabody. I knew all of these guys from

02:53.329 --> 02:58.196
Langley Field, the early current. They knew me. 
And of course, word got back, you know, word from

02:59.318 --> 03:03.544
the heroes. They followed very closely.

03:10.774 --> 03:17.404
I figured I'd call and work through Charlie 
Caldwell first, and I told him what the story was,

03:10.774 --> 03:17.404
and God bless him, he was just... He was 
tremendous. I think he was in the operations

03:20.126 --> 03:23.471
section. Let's

03:23.592 --> 03:29.160
correct this. General Naiden, N-A-I-D-E-N, was 
the commander of the 10th Air Force. General

03:35.389 --> 03:38.634
Peabody is the guy that sent me to Russia later on. 
But General Naiden was the commander in charge of

03:38.654 --> 03:41.558
Caldwell. So I explained to him, and I used red. 
Petak's condition is one of the reasons I said, I

03:45.329 --> 04:04.129
explained she's pregnant, and I said, quite 
frankly, I said, if you'd get her home on an

03:45.329 --> 04:04.129
airplane by ATC Air Transportation Command, 
which was under the United States Air Force,

03:45.329 --> 04:04.129
really took over Pan Am and all the airlines, you 
know what I mean. I said, really, just get her home.

04:05.831 --> 04:06.492
That's all right. Then Bob and I, if you can't get us 
on, well, okay, we'll go by ship or something.

04:11.215 --> 04:12.556
Well, he said, oh, no, no. I said, I'll tell you 
what, let me do some talking, and I'll call you

04:12.576 --> 04:16.620
back. The next day he called back and said, say, you 
come on up here to New Delhi. So we got on a train up

04:20.523 --> 04:29.891
New Delhi, and I introduced Red and Bob Neal to him, 
and they took us to dinner, and we talked at length.

04:29.991 --> 04:35.536
And this other gentleman, a great guy, I think of 
his name in a minute.

04:38.399 --> 04:41.121
Finally, they got me an audience for General 
Nadin, the commander. And I went in personally and

04:41.557 --> 04:45.502
by myself and told him the situation. He picked up 
the telephone and called General Hap Arnold's

04:45.522 --> 04:53.453
office in Washington, D.C. and explained the 
situation to him. And I think it was General Cuter

04:54.294 --> 05:05.009
or one of General Arnold's top aides who answered 
the phone and said, we'll get back with you

04:54.294 --> 05:05.009
tomorrow and give you the answer. And that 
morning, General Layton called me in the office

05:05.730 --> 05:09.775
and he handed me a wire and he said, He said, send him 
a wire. He had a wire in his hand. Give Quadrant

05:14.590 --> 05:34.359
Leader Charles R. Bond, Bob Neal, and Nurse Red 
P-Tech of the American Flying Interior Group a

05:14.590 --> 05:34.359
full accord and courtesy of the Air Transport 
Command back to the United States. And from then

05:35.942 --> 05:38.125
on, you know, no problem. So they flew you by? Yeah, 
and we got on ATC airplanes, various types.

05:45.211 --> 05:50.836
Actually, we flew in an old goonie bird from New 
Delhi clear across India to Karachi. Karachi, we

05:50.856 --> 06:06.390
flew across to Allahabad,

05:50.856 --> 06:06.390
and Allahabad to Aden, Aden to Khartoum, Khartoum 
to Tano,

06:09.172 --> 06:16.840
What do you call it, not the same name now, what is

06:09.172 --> 06:16.840
it? Gold Coast. Gold Coast. That's from the Gold 
Coast to Trans-Pertuson, an old, the only

06:18.401 --> 06:27.871
commercial version of the B-17 that ever built one 
of them. TWA. But as I mentioned, we flew from there

06:28.512 --> 06:35.879
to Natal, Natal then on this way back to Miami. Did 
you have a stunt there? Well, that's on the way

06:37.401 --> 06:38.162
over. Oh, okay. and back up to Miami.

06:49.383 --> 06:49.984
No, we did. We landed sentinel with them. That's a 
British air base at that time. And then when I got

06:56.192 --> 07:07.748
back to Miami, of course, we told Red goodbye, and 
Bob Neal and I went to New York, and Bob had ideas,

06:56.192 --> 07:07.748
and did go with Penebroke. a forerunner of Pan Am, 
eventually was taken over from Pan Am, Pan

07:08.369 --> 07:21.465
American Grace, as a pilot with an old flying boat, 
and he's Navy anyhow, and I was going to go to work

07:08.369 --> 07:21.465
for TWA. But, what happened after that? He went 
with Pan Am, I mean Pan Am, and flew with them a long

07:27.373 --> 07:34.782
time, and then finally he quit, and went to back to 
his old love, state of Washington, and he's now

07:35.099 --> 07:47.834
running a little fishing resort and been up there 
ever since on a little island in the sound right

07:35.099 --> 07:47.834
north of Seattle. And living with his wife. So he 
stayed with Pan Am for the rest of his career? No,

07:53.982 --> 07:55.564
no, he resigned from Pan Am. He resigned after 
about four or five years. Maybe six or eight years.

08:02.825 --> 08:21.212
And Red Petak is currently married to a gentleman 
who is running a,

08:02.825 --> 08:21.212
some sort of fish wholesale business in, I think 
it's Maryland, someplace in Maryland. And what

08:21.773 --> 08:24.316
did you decide to do? Well, my objective was to get a 
rate commission in the Air Force, and I didn't give

08:24.336 --> 08:30.365
up. So, I... I went with Bob Neal up and talked to 
Panagra people, and I wasn't too impressed with

08:32.997 --> 08:43.253
those people, but I still wanted commission in the 
Air Force. They wanted to go in commercial

08:43.333 --> 08:46.638
airlines.

08:47.900 --> 08:54.530
I wanted my regular commission, so I went down to 
Dallas Civilian. Had plenty of money at that time.

08:59.812 --> 09:11.570
I went down to Washington and walked into the 
munition building and kept talking to people

08:59.812 --> 09:11.570
until I got to General Hap Arnold's office and told 
him who I was. And of course, the officers, the

09:11.810 --> 09:18.761
major officers, they had certainly heard of 
Flying Tigers, and a lot of them had heard of me. I

09:19.803 --> 09:23.749
was one of the so-called heroes. And next thing I 
know, I finally got to General Cuter's office.

09:28.094 --> 09:28.875
K-U-T-E-R. He was a very good gentleman. He 
suddenly became a four-star general. Very fine.

09:33.701 --> 09:34.682
He was brilliant also. Got a half-armed 
right-hand man. And I walked into his office and I

09:37.466 --> 09:42.953
was, I was aggressive. I had one objective in mind 
and I didn't waste any time. I didn't pull any

09:46.177 --> 09:47.298
punches. And I said, I have come to see General 
Arnold, first of all. I'm sure he bought and he knew

09:51.644 --> 09:54.928
I was one. He's the one, by the way, who got us here. 
He said, well, General Arnott is going to be busy

09:59.982 --> 10:03.685
for a long time. I said, General Cuter, I know he's 
very busy, but I came here to see him. If I can't see

10:08.971 --> 10:11.313
him, then let's say so and I'll leave. He said, oh, 
no, wait a minute. Don't get mad. I said, you came

10:14.557 --> 10:16.139
here to see him, didn't you? I said, that's right. 
He said, well, don't leave until you see him. I

10:19.322 --> 10:21.544
said, well, I'm not going to wait all week. He said, 
I think we can probably get an appointment in the

10:21.564 --> 10:24.207
morning. I said, all right then, I'll wait until 
tomorrow. I hope he shook hands, and I walked down.

10:31.122 --> 10:34.667
Sure, if he called me 9 o'clock the next morning, 
I'd call him at 10, something like that. And I came

10:34.727 --> 10:47.666
down, and at the appropriate time, whenever it 
was, General Kuehler took me in General Arnold's

10:34.727 --> 10:47.666
office, and there he was sitting by his desk with 
his blouse open the way he usually does. And

10:48.747 --> 10:50.650
terrific man, terrific man. But I bet he had at 
least... six or eight generals crowding around

10:53.752 --> 10:58.937
him, standing at the desk. And it became fairly 
obvious, very obvious in no short, in a very short

10:58.957 --> 11:07.924
period of time, what all of the generals were 
doing. And... What were they doing? I'll tell you.

11:12.208 --> 11:22.257
I was, I'm going too slow for you, I know I'm 
dragging you out, but I, I took hands with the

11:12.208 --> 11:22.257
general, I said, told him where I was, and he says, 
what can I do for you? I said, General Arnold, I want

11:22.962 --> 11:25.606
a regular commission in the Air Force. I said, 
that's all I want. I said, I'll go back to China

11:26.828 --> 11:28.711
right now. I would have stayed in China, and I told 
Tex Sanders I'd stay in China if you'd give me a

11:28.731 --> 11:34.619
regular commission. I had a long talk with General 
Berg. He said he'd take Congress and give me a

11:37.443 --> 11:39.587
regular commission. I said, if anybody can give me 
a regular commission, I believe you can. I said,

11:43.152 --> 11:44.494
that's what I want. And then I'm back in the Air 
Force. I love it. He said, well... He says, Burton

11:49.743 --> 11:55.513
was right, that it will take an act of Congress, and 
I just don't see how I can do it. But tell me, young

11:55.533 --> 12:01.843
man, now tell me, what is it about the P-40 that you 
guys love and did so well? And he changed the

12:01.963 --> 12:04.568
conversation completely. And then he dominated 
me from then on, you know. And he got me started, and

12:07.252 --> 12:09.456
that's what all these journalists... They wanted 
to hear it. General Arnold was in a very bad

12:12.983 --> 12:16.448
political situation. He was being pushed by 
Congress and everybody that his superior's ego

12:16.468 --> 12:22.655
was such a fantastic airplane. He'd been shooting 
everything out of the sky, you know. He'd just

12:26.680 --> 12:30.985
eaten up American airplanes in the Philippines. 
You know, Pearl Harbor, fantastic airplane. And

12:33.508 --> 12:37.232
here, the Flying Tigers just shoot them down out of 
the sky like they're nothing. Why can't, what's

12:37.820 --> 12:40.824
the matter with you people in the Air Force? 
General Arnold was really in the spot. Here was an

12:42.687 --> 12:44.229
expert back. You know, been flying, had two, 
practically double A's. So he wants them the

12:48.195 --> 12:49.677
harshest amount. So he asked, and so I just built my 
guts right there, and I stood up and just let them

12:50.478 --> 12:57.709
have it like I'm telling you right now. And I said, 
there's not a damn thing wrong with the P-40. I

12:59.972 --> 13:01.494
said, people don't know how to fight. I said, 
there's a certain way you've got to fight it. Boy,

13:04.098 --> 13:07.383
these gentlemen stand there with their mouths 
open. And I said, it's a matter of tactics. I said,

13:10.771 --> 13:14.374
in some ways, the Japanese zero is superior to our 
airplane. But I said, in other ways, it won't match

13:14.394 --> 13:16.176
it. And then I explained the whole situation. What 
did you say? Well, the P-40 is structurally, we

13:20.640 --> 13:26.366
always build a terrific airplane. The P-40 
structurally was far superior to the zero. The

13:28.809 --> 13:36.236
zero was a tin can compared to a heavy steel, if you 
will, airplane. We could out-dive it. but we could

13:37.979 --> 13:39.301
not out-turn it. The top speed of them were about 
equal. At altitude, the jet airplane, around

13:43.306 --> 13:49.916
20,000 feet to zero, was probably superior to the 
P-40. At any altitude, it would out-turn the P-40,

13:50.096 --> 13:56.204
easily, out-climb it, out-maneuver it. You just 
could not maneuver it. But the P-40, you could put

13:58.407 --> 14:05.377
it straight down a dive and never worry about the 
tail coming off. It'd get cockeyed on you because

14:05.397 --> 14:07.480
of the propeller. Turk torsion, but it would leave 
the Zero away and he couldn't, his terminal speed

14:07.915 --> 14:20.426
was, you know, slower than if he'd fought him. 
Pretty soon he was out of gunnery range. All he had

14:21.867 --> 14:26.351
to do was dive away, go out and climb back up and use a 
tactic that Chennault told us. And that's the way

14:27.812 --> 14:30.855
we took care of the Zero. And that's what you told 
Half Iron? Yeah, and I told the story and it, you

14:32.436 --> 14:35.819
know, I summarized things. Strictly tactics. And 
I said, there's nothing in the world wrong with the

14:37.666 --> 14:40.350
Peacock. I'd go back and water it right now. And, oh 
boy, he took a death tear. Well, I made friends with

14:45.978 --> 14:48.321
the old man, obviously. But, again, he was sorry, 
and I left very, very, very sad. Oh, what did the

14:54.611 --> 14:57.194
other eight generals that were standing around 
say? Oh, they just listened. They didn't say

14:58.717 --> 14:59.678
anything? No. Oh, a few, they'd come up and answer a 
few questions. Well, you know, what's your,

15:02.382 --> 15:06.166
what's the max speed you think of the Zero? What do 
you think of the Jap pilot? Those types of

15:07.988 --> 15:12.372
questions. It'd be typical. And what'd you answer 
to the Japanese pilot question? Well, the

15:15.735 --> 15:21.080
Japanese pilot was a, in my opinion, was a 
mechanical type guy. He didn't have the, this is

15:21.120 --> 15:26.826
one that I met in combat. Why they flew their 
formation the way they did, which was absolutely

15:27.397 --> 15:33.803
asinine, I'll never know, like a play hive on 
airplanes. They stuck to 18,000 feet. Their

15:36.325 --> 15:38.167
tactics were stereotyped. We knew exactly what 
they were going to do each time they came over. They

15:40.829 --> 15:41.670
didn't bury them. The Navy pilot was far superior 
to the Army pilot, definitely. Far superior.

15:48.176 --> 15:50.898
That's the reason they bring them into 
hand-counted fine campaign. They're going to

15:50.918 --> 15:53.501
eliminate us. Had we fought zeroes all the time, 
Initially, I didn't start. I think we would have

15:58.415 --> 16:00.538
had a little bit tougher time. Sure. I still think 
we would have

16:00.858 --> 16:07.768
prevailed. The primary question was oriented to 
the P-40 versus the Zero, and that's what the old

16:07.788 --> 16:13.916
man was. In other words, they were trying to get the 
old man to buy everything like a Zero. Well, he,

16:18.482 --> 16:23.108
General Oren, wasn't for it, and his generals 
weren't for it, but they needed backup. Yeah. They

16:24.586 --> 16:28.712
wanted an expert's opinion on this, and then take 
it to Congress. And look what came out of the P-40,

16:28.912 --> 16:33.698
the P-51, one of the greatest airplanes we ever 
built. Mustang, you know? Yeah. And then the old

16:35.621 --> 16:42.430
iron-gutted jug, we called it, the P-47, you know, 
that great big thing. It had the, when you turn that

16:42.450 --> 16:47.256
thing into a power dive, you never worry about it 
coming to pieces. Run through an orange grove on a

16:47.276 --> 16:52.163
landing, you know, belly up, it never hurts you. 
And so, how long were you with General Arno? I

16:57.681 --> 17:00.745
wasn't in there long in about 45 minutes. Thank 
you. Turned around and left. Went back. Then I went

17:03.048 --> 17:03.709
home. Do you know what the date of this meeting was?

17:09.557 --> 17:10.458
That's not my diary. My diary ended when I landed in 
Miami. August the 17th. It must have been the

17:14.784 --> 17:19.751
latter part of August. I can't I don't remember, 
and I don't think I'm recording. Last of August,

17:22.380 --> 17:23.742
1942. Last of August, 1942. Okay. And subsequent 
to that, then, see, I was disappointed, and I had

17:27.328 --> 17:35.880
failed in one of my missions. I had made enough 
money to come back and buy a house for my mom and dad.

17:40.588 --> 17:42.150
I did that. How much money did you make? Oh, I came 
back with more than $10,000 in my bank. Wow. With

17:49.876 --> 17:50.817
more than $15,000. More than $15,000? Boy, that's 
a lot of money for them, isn't it? Yeah. And none of

17:57.426 --> 17:59.389
that was gambling. I didn't gamble. No, that was 
just combat pay. Combat pay and travel pay, extra

18:02.133 --> 18:10.885
pay for staying over longer, and transportation 
pay, some transportation expense pay that I

18:02.133 --> 18:10.885
didn't use. But at any rate, I achieved two of my 
objectives. I got the combat experience. Yeah. I

18:20.062 --> 18:27.532
have my mother and father put them in a home, which 
is better than they've been used to, which I felt

18:20.062 --> 18:27.532
great about. But third one, I didn't get the 
regular permission. But I still had my blood. You

18:32.940 --> 18:34.022
still had your what? I had it in my blood, the 
military. I started to work for TWA and worked for

18:36.105 --> 18:45.698
about 16 days and decided it wasn't for me and 
walked in and told Jack Person, the personnel

18:36.105 --> 18:45.698
manager, In the gravity point hangar there at 
National Air Force. Look, I'm sorry. I just, I

18:53.037 --> 18:55.640
don't have it in me. I've got to go back to the Air 
Force. And he took one look at me and says, I

18:58.583 --> 19:01.866
understand perfectly. I don't blame you a bit. He 
said, you can go right ahead. He said,

19:04.168 --> 19:09.634
furthermore, we'll pay you for the 16 days that 
you've just been taking a physical examination

19:04.168 --> 19:09.634
for us. He says, I'm proud of you. So I walked across 
to Were you flying during that time? No, I was just

19:18.187 --> 19:20.470
being, for TWA? No, I was just, 16 days, filling out 
forms and taking a physical exam. They gave me a

19:27.721 --> 19:30.265
complete physical. Okay, so then you went back 
to... At that time, I don't, I have, I'm not sure

19:30.285 --> 19:42.263
whether it was in the Pentagon, but then whether it 
was finished or not. It seemed like I went over to

19:42.530 --> 19:45.154
the Pentagon. I went back in the Air Force, or 
wherever it was. The personnel told them I'm going

19:47.938 --> 19:51.142
to go back to service. Of course, they immediately 
took me back in and put me in. As a reserve officer?

19:56.310 --> 19:58.813
As a reserve officer, second lieutenant. Second 
lieutenant? When you could have been a major?

20:01.657 --> 20:03.800
Well, legally, I had to go back that way. They 
explained to me that this is, when I went back home

20:03.820 --> 20:10.750
and told them I wanted to go back to service, this is 
the way they told me. Well, I said, Yeah, we'll take

20:11.740 --> 20:16.225
you in as a first lieutenant. We have to do this 
reserve. I think it's October the 14th, 1942.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.372
Okay. And that's when my active duty started 
again. Okay. And then in one week, they promoted me

20:26.675 --> 20:29.198
to a captain. Another week, I was promoted to a 
major. Another week, I was promoted to a

20:31.140 --> 20:33.262
lieutenant colonel. I stayed there about two or 
three months in the Pentagon. Of course, in the

20:38.605 --> 20:45.674
meantime, I'd come back to Dallas in August and got 
married to Dorn on the 14th of August, 19. Okay,

20:46.915 --> 20:58.409
before we get into this part of your career, which 
starts October 1942, there are a couple of

20:46.915 --> 20:58.409
questions, just a couple more questions I want to 
ask about the Flying Tigers. One, you landed a lot

20:59.210 --> 21:05.878
of RAF bases, Royal Air Force bases. And I was 
wondering about the relationship between the

21:06.449 --> 21:18.160
British maintenance men, the base captains, the 
fliers, and the American Flying Tigers. How'd you

21:18.480 --> 21:19.461
get along with them? Well, tremendous. Matter of 
fact, one RAF

21:21.503 --> 21:35.376
pilot, no, he was an administrative officer, he 
actually left the RAF in Rangoon And in effect,

21:36.149 --> 21:37.871
just told him to go to hell. He went up into Kunming, 
China with us and stayed with us until we

21:38.552 --> 21:43.578
disbanded. And I don't know what ever happened to 
that man, but he never, as far as I know, he never

21:43.598 --> 21:48.964
went back to the RAF. Eventually, I sort of lost 
track of him. I think his name was Davis. I don't

21:55.772 --> 21:57.053
know what happened to him. Why did he do that? He 
wasn't getting the job back? He loved us. He loved

21:59.576 --> 22:00.217
us. He wanted to stay with us. He thought we were 
without a doubt the best. He thought we were gods,

22:02.930 --> 22:05.032
superhumans. He thought we were the greatest 
outfit in the world. The RAF pilots that I met, most

22:08.857 --> 22:16.646
of them, the majority of them by far, I had a great 
respect for. I never will forget old William

22:16.686 --> 22:20.791
Commander Carey, a terrific guy. He thought the 
world and all of us. You know, we were the only ones.

22:25.897 --> 22:30.263
that were really making any progress or could, you 
know, just knock the Japs off at will. We were the

22:30.423 --> 22:34.609
only bright spot in the entire world against the 
Japanese Air Force. Against Japan. Yeah. And

22:36.571 --> 22:40.917
until, you know, Doolittle, Major Ray, and 
incidentally Doolittle folks came back. We met

22:40.957 --> 22:43.581
several of them coming back to China with us. Oh, 
wow. You had to tell me about that. I talked to

22:45.423 --> 22:47.707
several of them. But we were the only bright spot on 
the horizon then. The old...

22:55.597 --> 22:58.521
And so the few of the bomber pilots I didn't 
particularly care about. I had a lot of service

22:59.362 --> 23:03.047
with the RAF in subsequent times, you know. And did 
they go out on you? Oh boy, they'd go in their

23:05.591 --> 23:09.316
hurricane just like we would, and eager to go as we 
were. And that hurricane was a sorry, it was a sorry

23:09.356 --> 23:13.782
airplane, the P-40. And they lost a lot of people 
because they didn't have the benefit of our

23:13.802 --> 23:20.251
tactics and Chenault's construction. They lost 
they just lost practically everything in

23:22.327 --> 23:25.990
Singapore and wherever they were. They lost a lot 
of people. But the, no telling how many missions

23:29.554 --> 23:46.750
Carrie had, Wing Commander Carrie had been on, and 
he'd get, Bob Neal was one of his favorites, they

23:29.554 --> 23:46.750
came very close, and of course I'd already known 
Bob, and we'd get together at night and get on the

23:29.554 --> 23:46.750
drinking spree sometime. Terrific guy. We got 
along great together. So they shared Are you,

23:52.060 --> 23:58.447
whenever you, when you were over there, you shared 
food and supplies? They actually, outside of

23:58.487 --> 24:07.377
China, if it wasn't for the RAF and their support, 
we couldn't have gotten home. We depend on them.

24:08.698 --> 24:17.848
And apparently the Chinese who lent leaves in the 
United States and Britain had come to this

24:08.698 --> 24:17.848
agreement that in Burma, you know, they'd support 
us as well. And that's the reason we used their air

24:18.470 --> 24:20.233
bases. And we would go down to send General 
Chenault's airplane down to Singapore before it

24:20.393 --> 24:30.290
was taken to get some maybe tires from them. We'd be 
out of tires, you know. The tires for their

24:32.534 --> 24:38.044
particular airplanes, that's how I think it flew 
to Buffalo with 50 people on it. We used their

24:38.565 --> 24:39.547
oxygen. We used their mess facilities. We got 
along great with them. The airmen. particularly

24:44.238 --> 24:45.620
got along greatly. The airmen got along much, much 
better with them than they did with the United

24:45.680 --> 24:54.373
States Air Force types that began to come over 
there. Why? Oh, well, the airmen were the NCOs,

24:55.214 --> 25:02.345
particularly the key ones. Not only the Air Force, 
but the Navy, Marines, and Air Force. All of them,

25:06.010 --> 25:12.540
they had more of a reason, I think, to get out of the 
services maybe than The officers, they were more

25:12.892 --> 25:17.897
griped, I think, at the service. So you had a chance 
to make more money. And we had some Mavericks in

25:20.679 --> 25:32.250
the, many more Maverick types in the so-called 
enlisted types, airmen, than we did in the Air

25:20.679 --> 25:32.250
Force. We had a few 8-ball, I mean in the pilots. We 
had a few 8-ball officer types in the pilots. Now,

25:40.145 --> 25:42.247
competence, I'm not telling them competence. 
These airmen were fantastic. They were terrific.

25:45.651 --> 25:48.394
But some of them did carry a chip on their shoulder. 
Against the Army Air Force. Well, Navy, too, and

25:51.718 --> 25:53.560
Marine. Whenever they'd catch a, you know, during 
the days when ATC began to ferry supplies up into

25:53.580 --> 26:09.358
China, you know, a lot of parts of our one year, 
April up through July, we'd meet some of the Air

25:53.580 --> 26:09.358
Force officers. Particularly the higher ranking 
ones, colonels and brigadier general types, you

26:10.233 --> 26:18.862
know. The airmen get a few drinks in there, run to 
their bell, and they were, they didn't sober. Oh,

26:23.346 --> 26:23.927
really? And I, of course, I didn't like to see that. 
I felt a little ashamed of that. But, you know, in

26:30.173 --> 26:38.502
some cases, maybe they had a reason, because,

26:30.173 --> 26:38.502
well, I don't know. It was my observation that 
generally the Air Force types, Navy types, and

26:38.870 --> 27:04.519
what few Marine Corps types, you know, that came 
over there that were real gentlemen and knew what

26:38.870 --> 27:04.519
they were doing and knew the situation, they 
didn't have trouble. But Prince Tex Handler had

27:04.539 --> 27:07.763
the wrong idea when he tried to recruit them. Oh, 
yeah. Now, here's a question about the airmen.

27:11.791 --> 27:12.352
What? Here's a question about the airmen. When 
Chennault changed or was back in, I guess,

27:15.334 --> 27:26.204
commission back in the Air Force, what happened to 
the airmen? Well, the airmen came home, too. Oh,

27:28.446 --> 27:29.667
they did, huh? See, of course, now you say when they 
come home, they were subject to induction and

27:29.767 --> 27:36.973
prescription and, I'm sure, come back to service.

27:38.894 --> 27:40.756
I can't remember exactly how many. You were too, 
weren't you? Right. Technically? Right. But see,

27:44.761 --> 27:48.405
had I gone to work for airlines, they wouldn't pay. 
See, that would be a, what do you call it, exempted

27:48.425 --> 27:53.811
job. Well, the airmen came back and sought the same 
types of jobs, like with the aircraft industry,

27:53.831 --> 27:59.958
with airlines. A lot of them went with airlines. 
Many of them went with airlines. And, you know, the

28:03.222 --> 28:07.146
pilots, like crew chiefs, take a crew chief and 
they'd talk. They put in there two bits for crew

28:07.531 --> 28:11.295
teeth to go to work for there, and the airlines 
needed them. Sure. Did Chennault try to talk them

28:13.697 --> 28:16.439
into staying? He treated them the same way he did 
the politics. He said, I can sure use you, but you

28:18.661 --> 28:23.386
do, you've earned it. You do what you want to do. If 
you want to go home, I don't know where to get you.

28:28.391 --> 28:29.932
And most of them went home, too. Yeah. And most of 
them had to go by boat. It took them a long time to get

28:34.917 --> 28:36.238
home.

28:41.956 --> 28:43.178
What happened to the others? Out of your entire 
Flying Tiger group in July, at the end, how many

28:43.999 --> 29:01.602
were there left, and how many decided to stay with 
Chenault, and how many decided to go home?

29:06.128 --> 29:10.714
At the date of disbandment on July 4th, actually, 
July the 20th, 16 days after, you know, he had some

29:11.032 --> 29:16.117
of us stay out. Let's say on the 20th of July, all of 
us went home except, if I remember correctly, I

29:16.417 --> 29:32.954
think there were five or six pilots, five or six Air 
Force pilots that decided to stay over. Well, no,

29:32.974 --> 29:34.636
Tex Hill was like the Navy. Five or six pilots 
decided to stay over and go into the Air Force,

29:35.156 --> 29:41.022
right on the spot. And Airman, I don't really 
recall, and I'm not even sure it's in my diary book

29:41.879 --> 29:49.368
there, or in my diary. So five or six pilots out of 
how many? I'd say out of... That were left on the 4th

29:53.072 --> 30:01.963
of July.

30:02.023 --> 30:07.870
I'm guessing, I'd say four or five out of about, at 
that time,

30:12.423 --> 30:15.808
40, 45, see a lot of them had already gone home. Some 
of the pilots went home just before July 4th. They

30:19.975 --> 30:20.836
just had it. Well, they had it, yeah, and they knew 
they were good. And the old man people, they were in

30:23.099 --> 30:26.565
Kunming not doing a thing. He didn't actually have 
enough airplanes for him to fly. Oh, no kidding. Or

30:31.853 --> 30:35.799
enough anything for the airmen to do. Kunming was 
rapidly becoming nothing but a sort of a air

30:39.220 --> 30:40.922
transport stopped. The Japanese weren't raising 
a place anymore. So by May of 42, the Flying Tigers

30:44.385 --> 30:50.172
were beginning to disband.

30:54.957 --> 30:57.800
I'd say as early as June. Maybe late May, yeah. 
Okay, okay. And your original, what did you say you

31:01.684 --> 31:05.768
had? My original plan was to have 100 airplanes and 
100 pilots, and a total of 250 people.

31:15.623 --> 31:18.726
And how many did you ever have full-strength, do 
you think? No, we never did have full-strength

31:19.006 --> 31:20.828
pilots. No, I know, but approximately how many did 
you ever have? I think probably 65. The last

31:26.313 --> 31:30.177
contingent was about the same as mine, around 35. 
Maybe 70. Okay,

31:32.479 --> 31:36.463
and all... but five decided to go, four or five 
decided to go home. Yeah. Now, did you find that

31:42.600 --> 31:44.002
unusual? That all, that no one wanted to stay and 
continue the war effort? No, I didn't. As a matter

31:51.131 --> 31:56.778
of fact,

31:51.131 --> 31:56.778
Tex Hill was ex-Navy. Tex was actually born in 
China. His missionary parents. He's a Texan boy.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.607
You've probably heard of him. He stayed over. Bill 
Martin, a Texacana boy. No, he went back over. Mack

32:14.779 --> 32:20.085
McCormick? I forget his name. I can't remember his 
name. He was an Air Force fighter jockey. I

32:26.193 --> 32:28.616
think... I don't know. It's hard. I've asked 
myself that question. Why did they stay? Tex

32:32.160 --> 32:36.606
Hill is a He's an Orient. He loves the Orient. Like I 
say, he was born and raised over there. As a matter

32:41.987 --> 32:52.837
of fact, Tex still represents certain agencies in 
the Far East today. He spent a lot of time in Taiwan,

32:54.079 --> 32:59.023
Japan, and the Far East. But the other guys, as a 
matter of fact, two out of those five I think were

33:00.365 --> 33:05.850
killed I don't

33:06.100 --> 33:12.827
know. Everybody was just eager to get home now. Oh 
yeah, by far a majority.

33:23.198 --> 33:23.939
Were you sort of sad? Tired, combat weary. I

33:26.762 --> 33:33.930
think really, in my opinion, I'm convinced that 
Texas Amherst's approach to recruit us was by far

33:34.282 --> 33:39.889
the greatest factor for his policy.

33:43.213 --> 33:54.127
And I know had the Air Force, you know it still 
hasn't come around, I think 47 they did something,

33:43.213 --> 33:54.127
the act of 47 on the defense department, that's 
when I got my regular commission, 1947. So I

33:54.187 --> 33:57.551
ultimately achieved that too. But I had the Air 
Force, you know, said, well, look, we'll get an

34:02.834 --> 34:05.858
acronym where we can give. You guys have earned it 
in your combat duty. Although you left the

34:08.401 --> 34:13.347
service,

34:08.401 --> 34:13.347
we'll get you ready. I think, I bet you there could 
have been as many as 25 or 30, let's say. I would say

34:18.113 --> 34:23.620
25 or 30. And a lot of the airmen, I think, see, You 
know, an airman becomes close camaraderie

34:25.936 --> 34:31.923
between a lot of the airmen and the pilots over 
there. We're a pilot state. I'm sure you can talk to

34:33.185 --> 34:35.027
airmen in the state. A lot of them in the state. But 
just like anything, it's like fire. It starts

34:38.331 --> 34:39.232
spreading. It keeps spreading like more and more. 
As the river gets around, I'm going home. Gee, if

34:43.797 --> 34:45.459
you go home, I'll go home. Something like that. 
Sure. Chain effect. Okay.

34:51.126 --> 34:51.727
Okay. Now, tell me about Doolittle. All I know 
about the Doolittle is, of course, we heard about

34:55.957 --> 35:00.462
it on the radio. Was it July of 42? June of 42? It had 
to be early in July. Was it April? Maybe it was

35:09.351 --> 35:10.172
April. April, I think. Because, matter of fact, we 
were still at Kunming when I met two of the pilots At

35:21.050 --> 35:26.535
the hostel one night, they had trickled down 
through the underground. I mean, Chinese picked

35:26.615 --> 35:29.898
them up, got them through the line. Some of them 
went down the line. A lot of them went down the line.

35:32.940 --> 35:33.220
Japanese line. Chinese bugged them through the 
line. Basically, going down to Kunming, where air

35:35.622 --> 35:40.527
transport command terminal is, before they get 
on. And I met a couple of them there. I'm pretty sure

35:42.548 --> 35:44.370
it was around April. I'm almost sure it was April. 
And of course, they told a story, the Chinese. I

35:51.492 --> 35:58.440
guess the Chinese still are super spies, in my 
opinion. Of course, Japanese are too, but I don't

35:58.460 --> 36:01.683
think he meant Chinese.

36:07.490 --> 36:11.194
I don't know much about that except what I read 
later on. Did they tell you any of their

36:11.234 --> 36:14.197
experiences when they were flying over Tokyo? Did 
they tell you this story? Well, I can't remember. I

36:20.558 --> 36:23.120
remember, obviously, you know, we talked about 
it. And he told us...

36:27.804 --> 36:32.809
I think the subject did come up about the fact that 
he said, well, I can't talk too much about it. I

36:32.969 --> 36:36.752
think that, you know, the old story of keeping 
quiet about things. I think that came up once, but

36:37.373 --> 36:43.998
after a few drinks, you know, the bar after dinner, 
they'd tell us a little bit about it. I think most of

36:44.899 --> 36:48.162
what I know, though, is what I've read since And 
also I knew one of the Air Force boys who

36:48.597 --> 36:56.008
participated in the flight of Colonel real well, I 
forget his name, I served with him in the act. Did

36:56.769 --> 36:58.872
you know Doolittle? I've met him, matter of fact 
we've had him at our reunion a couple of times,

36:58.892 --> 37:05.081
yeah. But you met him later on, you didn't even 
know. No, I never did meet him when he came. Okay.

37:12.992 --> 37:17.018
Well, that sounds like this is a really 
fascinating part of your life. What was the

37:17.791 --> 37:30.529
entire, overall, looking back 40 years later, 
what do you think the impact of the Flying Tigers,

37:17.791 --> 37:30.529
what was the impact that the Flying Tigers had on 
your life and your career?

37:34.194 --> 37:37.579
Well, I think perhaps it...

37:46.372 --> 37:47.393
I think it... served several purposes, one of 
which it seemed as though I had achieved some of my

37:49.651 --> 37:56.700
objectives. Sure. Two out of three. Yeah. Plus, 
not only that, but I had made money. I had become a

38:02.527 --> 38:03.689
hero. I was proud of what I'd done. And, you know, 
the American Federation album, there's a lot of

38:06.793 --> 38:10.477
other books. I was 19...

38:14.703 --> 38:18.848
When I came home in Dallas, I was given the... 
Dallas Chamber of Commerce award for the

38:19.486 --> 38:37.438
outstanding young man, the outstanding,

38:19.486 --> 38:37.438
the outstanding Texan in the Junior Chamber of 
Commerce in 1942 in Dallas, and that was quite an

38:19.486 --> 38:37.438
honor.

38:39.281 --> 38:43.148
I guess I bask in the glory and the heroism People 
wanted me to have a place. I got tired of that. You

38:47.727 --> 38:57.660
know, when the

38:47.727 --> 38:57.660
so-called, what are prisoners in Iran, Tehran? 
You know, when they were freed. Hostages.

39:00.043 --> 39:00.623
Hostages. When they were freed and came home and 
you began to read stories, they were tired. I went

39:04.408 --> 39:06.331
through the same thing. I wanted to be left alone. I 
had

39:08.073 --> 39:12.358
some... very fine people who had their jobs, you 
know, raising money for war bonds and so forth,

39:13.064 --> 39:19.872
wanted to participate, and I was tired of it all. I 
got quite angry when I wasn't participating, but I

39:19.952 --> 39:27.281
wasn't nasty about it. I couldn't do as many as they 
wanted me to every single day. I wanted to rest, and

39:31.225 --> 39:34.329
I was tired. And I wanted to do some thinking. Just 
exactly like those hospitals. I often look at...

39:43.085 --> 39:48.772
Well, so many times I watched those hostages in the 
news media after them. And I thought, oh, what I

39:48.873 --> 39:52.938
could tell a news reporter. What I could tell a news 
reporter. But they got their job to do. I'm proud of

39:59.887 --> 40:02.270
what I did. The experience was worth millions and 
millions of dollars. I think I would do it again.

40:13.983 --> 40:16.506
I've seen this happen before in the world. I 
understand now about,

40:16.606 --> 40:32.822
for instance, this is what Cuba's doing, various 
places, as what do you call them, as a henchman of

40:16.606 --> 40:32.822
Russia, all over the world. Only there, this is 
more, it's not exactly like that one, but I don't

40:33.522 --> 40:41.070
understand. What do you mean, this is what Q was 
talking about? Russia is using- Oh, I was asking

40:44.364 --> 40:48.029
about the impact, remember? We were talking 
about- Yeah, I got what you said. Yeah, let's stay

40:50.152 --> 40:52.495
on the subject. We have enough to talk about, 
believe me. But I was wondering about the impact

40:54.878 --> 41:03.130
that being in the Flying Tigers had on your life, 
and you said you accomplished those things. You

41:03.430 --> 41:06.214
also came back the hero. Was there any impact on 
your future career? Did it help you in the service?

41:11.139 --> 41:14.204
Was it an impetus for a generalship eventually? 
Oh, yes, no doubt. The record I had, no doubt, was it

41:16.427 --> 41:23.718
pushed me to lieutenant colonel right away in just 
two weeks. And immediately this had quite an

41:23.738 --> 41:34.935
impact on the, immediately almost, the 
assignment as a pilot and aide. I've asked a

41:35.371 --> 41:36.793
Harriman to Russia.

41:40.959 --> 41:42.160
Just came down to have Barnum. General Peabody at 
the Air Force School of Applied Tactics where I was

41:42.541 --> 41:48.209
teaching credit tactics at that time. So you got to 
meet, you got to advance professionally and you

41:49.170 --> 41:54.458
got to meet Harriman. Oh yeah. One thing led to 
another. Sure, help your career. Renown, if you

41:59.805 --> 42:00.947
will. Medals. which I'm proud of, particularly 
that British DSC, that one of three of us in ABG was

42:04.312 --> 42:15.162
given British Distinguished Lion Cross. And if 
you'll notice, I don't have a single American

42:16.203 --> 42:22.289
combat record. I did all my combat

42:22.309 --> 42:33.019
in effect in China, and I have Chinese combat 
decorations and a British Distinguished Lion

42:22.309 --> 42:33.019
Cross. The top one there, the Air Force 
Distinguished Service medal in service. So, this

42:41.678 --> 42:45.825
being part of the Flying Tigers and that decision- 
Oh, it contributed. You bet it did.

42:53.063 --> 43:01.512
One reason they assigned me to the United States 
Air Force School of Applied Tactics in Orlando, it

42:53.063 --> 43:01.512
was a school where we taught actual combat 
tactics. We still learn upon it down there.

43:03.774 --> 43:06.077
Teaching actual combat tactics. And I wrote 
manuals from my experience. They're still in use,

43:08.359 --> 43:10.161
I'm sure. And so, Hap Arnold saw a place for you 
because of your speaking out when you met him in

43:11.322 --> 43:18.290
that meeting. I often think that And I'll get to 
that story later on. That's an interesting one you

43:22.548 --> 43:24.210
want to hear. I think Hap Gorno remembered me. This 
was, let me see, that was in August of 42, and this

43:27.614 --> 43:40.950
was in about

43:27.614 --> 43:40.950
a year later, August 43. Matter of fact, I know he 
remembered me because it said he came up about

43:42.172 --> 43:47.518
Chenault. And that probably I think he probably 
admired my aggressive attitude in my career, I

43:52.126 --> 44:00.877
mean my combat experience, which is one thing he 
wanted. He wanted a man to go to Russia and talk to

44:01.238 --> 44:07.325
Red Army Air Force officers that had experience in 
fighting. He could talk, you know,

44:07.806 --> 44:11.991
authoritatively, not from bombers, fighters. 
Okay, so the Flying Tigers helped you in that? You

44:18.518 --> 44:24.244
never, did you ever regret the decision that you 
decided to quit the Air Force and go on a flying

44:18.518 --> 44:24.244
tour? Not one bit, I did. As a matter of fact, 
sometimes I think I'm just lucky that Gilboa

44:27.708 --> 44:38.399
Grover knew I wanted great information and 
thought it might be a good idea to call me and let me

44:27.708 --> 44:38.399
know. Otherwise, I don't know how I would have 
learned about it. No, I don't regret that at all.

44:49.231 --> 45:09.095
The experiences that I had as

44:49.231 --> 45:09.095
a person,

44:49.231 --> 45:09.095
they had their imprint, probably too, on what's 
right and what's wrong, what's dangerous, what's

44:49.231 --> 45:09.095
not dangerous. I matured an awful lot in one year of 
combat. I think anybody does. I matured an awful

45:14.701 --> 45:17.685
lot.

45:22.019 --> 45:35.574
It definitely had a profound effect, I think, on my 
thinking, my

45:22.019 --> 45:35.574
advancement, my professional career. I was a 
professional far forehead of a lot of my buddies

45:35.594 --> 45:43.283
and cohorts. Okay, well, I think this is a good 
place to stop, and I want to start. Yeah, good.

45:51.635 --> 46:09.713
the second interview with General Bond and today 
is the 22nd, July 1981 and we were at the impact of

45:51.635 --> 46:09.713
the Flying Tigers on your life and we had finished 
that and you told how you got out of the Flying

45:51.635 --> 46:09.713
Tigers and came back to the United States. From 
October of 1942 to June of 1943 you were commander

46:12.096 --> 46:21.405
of the 81st Fighter Squadron in Orlando, Florida 
as a Lieutenant And you tell me about that

46:21.908 --> 46:24.151
assignment.

46:27.016 --> 46:30.861
That was at the Air Force School of Applied 
Tactics. And it was an organization where combat

46:30.881 --> 46:38.913
experienced people like myself had key 
positions. And the pilots themselves in the

46:39.895 --> 46:51.392
organization were combat experienced pilots to 
the extent they could get them at that stage of the

46:39.895 --> 46:51.392
war. And we brought cadres of, let's say, a new 
fighter organization, the wing commander, the

46:51.980 --> 47:14.586
group commander, and the squadron commander, and 
probably his flight leaders, where we would

46:51.980 --> 47:14.586
actually fly with them and document them in 
specifically combat tactics of fighter units and

46:51.980 --> 47:14.586
fighter aircraft. That was the whole purpose of 
the organization, my job. And it was interesting.

47:22.648 --> 47:26.517
We killed a lot of pilots down there because we flew 
realistic missions. Matter of fact, one of the

47:26.537 --> 47:32.911
Flying Tiger buddies that was in my squadron was 
killed. No kidding. How? We were running some

47:36.038 --> 47:38.524
tactics.
