WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:05.187
Thursday testing, testing, testing. Testing. 
One, two, three. This is Thursday, January 10,

00:08.012 --> 00:16.707
2002, in downtown Albuquerque, and I have the 
pleasure and honor of interviewing Sam Camilli,

00:17.176 --> 00:19.860
class of 73. To introduce yourself to any reader of 
the transcript or any listener of the tape, tell

00:19.880 --> 00:39.868
about yourself, background, growing up, what did 
mom and dad do, where'd you go to high school, and so

00:19.880 --> 00:39.868
forth. We're a fifth generation El Paso family. We 
were born and raised there. I went to Austin High

00:45.880 --> 00:48.704
School along with my four brothers. My father and 
my grandfather were both in the wholesale food

00:49.986 --> 00:56.494
business, and we basically grew out of that. My 
older brother preceded me at A&M, of which I was

00:58.858 --> 01:04.025
responsible for getting him there. I got there. 
Basically, my best friend is a Malooly, and his

01:07.489 --> 01:13.778
father Albert Malooly graduated in 52 and ever 
since I was you know played baseball played

01:14.146 --> 01:39.158
football and he wanted us to just go to A&M he 
thought he was recruiting everybody for A&M and so

01:14.146 --> 01:39.158
he recruited my brother and of course I wanted to go 
first but Lou my brother got there before me so

01:14.146 --> 01:39.158
that's really how I got there I almost didn't get in 
I didn't have my application until May 31st when my

01:39.728 --> 01:42.534
counselor said, you think you're going where? I 
said, well, I'm going to go to A&M. I said, well, you

01:43.676 --> 01:46.422
better get an application in because you won't get 
there. And I said, well, Coach Chandler already

01:46.442 --> 01:52.455
said I'm getting in, but I said, but I guess I better 
get my application in. Had you visited College

01:52.840 --> 01:56.826
Station and the campus before you went over to 
enroll? Had you ever been there? Yeah, I went down

01:57.888 --> 02:01.413
to see my brother play ball and went to the 
architecture building. I wanted to be in

02:01.433 --> 02:02.895
architecture, so. What was your impression when 
you saw it, in fact? I loved it. I mean, my whole life

02:08.083 --> 02:16.936
had been for, you know, 12 years of school was 
basically getting to A&M. That's what I wanted to

02:17.177 --> 02:18.078
do. So that's really when I got there, I fell in love 
with it, you know. My brother loved it, had a good

02:22.152 --> 02:27.078
job, you know, a good opportunity there and a good 
school there. Now, your brother played? He played

02:29.762 --> 02:31.865
baseball and he played pro baseball. He went three 
years and then signed a pro contract. And was Tom

02:36.090 --> 02:37.913
Chandler already there? Yes, he was our coach, 
loved him. Good man, good. He was a great man, great

02:41.798 --> 02:44.521
coach, great human being. I mean, just absolutely 
wonderful. When you went over to enroll in the fall

02:47.465 --> 02:57.696
of 69,

02:47.465 --> 02:57.696
how did you get there and what did you take with you? 
Describe the trip from El Paso to College Station.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.703
Well, I always tell this story about my trip. When 
my brother went to A&M, my parents got in the car,

03:03.723 --> 03:10.991
loaded him up, took him down there in the car. Mom 
made sure he had a place to sleep. And they were

03:12.874 --> 03:13.734
there. I can't remember what hall they had. They 
were torn down the hall. It was horrible. finish

03:17.637 --> 03:24.147
Fowler Hall, which is where he stayed and I stayed, 
but this place was really the pits. And of course my

03:24.167 --> 03:40.512
mother saw it, she was all worried about him, you 
know, she says, oh, he's not going to be happy here,

03:24.167 --> 03:40.512
he's going to be, so they, I mean, she just, over and 
over, both of them just made over, and Tom Chandler

03:24.167 --> 03:40.512
said, they'll be fine, the dorm will be finished in 
a month or so, and they'll be in the new, brand new

03:24.167 --> 03:40.512
dorm. Well, when I went to A&M, my dad handed me a 
plane ticket, I took two suitcases and he says,

03:43.827 --> 03:47.731
have a good time in college, son. I don't have to 
worry about you. So by, you know, the experience of

03:49.973 --> 03:55.299
my brother and Coach Chandler basically saying, 
hey, don't worry. Sam's going to be okay. We got him

03:56.240 --> 03:57.061
a room. He's fine. He said, call Tom when you get, 
Coach, when you get there. He'll come to the

04:02.787 --> 04:04.989
airport, pick you up, take you to your dorm. Well, 
that's what happened. I had two suitcases. I

04:07.532 --> 04:08.713
called Coach Chandler. Coach Chandler showed up. 
He picked me up. He says, is that all you had? That's

04:12.597 --> 04:13.378
all I got? went to the dorms. Is that your room? 
You're supposed to be here to register or get all

04:16.460 --> 04:20.329
your stuff, but I'm taking care of it. If you have 
any questions, call me. We'll see you later. So,

04:24.438 --> 04:25.220
you know, here I am. I get there. I went in to the, you 
know, the down below or the I can't remember what

04:33.642 --> 04:38.086
they called it then, but got my keys, went up to the 
room, got all set up. What dorm was it? Fowler Hall.

04:40.449 --> 04:40.789
Fowler. And that was the athletic dorm. That was 
basically where all the other jocks except the

04:42.911 --> 04:46.895
football players. And they were still in 
Henderson? They were still in Henderson. All

04:50.458 --> 04:51.219
right. What did you, in those two suitcases, what 
did you take? Actually, it was funny. I had all my

04:55.763 --> 04:59.667
clothes in one and my stereo in the other. So I had to 
have music. So I played in a band. I had a bunch of

05:03.618 --> 05:09.006
musical background, so I made sure I had music. And 
my roommate showed up, John Alvin Woods from

05:10.028 --> 05:15.356
Nacogdoches, and he saw I had a stereo. He said, oh, 
I'm so happy you brought your stereo. I said, yeah,

05:17.420 --> 05:22.307
you don't know how much trouble it was to pack that 
thing in that suitcase and make sure it got here

05:17.420 --> 05:22.307
okay. Now, you flew El Paso to Houston. And a little 
DC-3 from Houston to College Station. And Coach

05:31.889 --> 05:34.312
Chandler came to meet you. Yes, he did. Did you have 
a scholarship? No, I didn't have a scholarship,

05:37.176 --> 05:41.120
but he made sure I had a room. And I was on the team, 
and he got me a few books. He says, we can help you

05:47.327 --> 05:51.372
with your books because that's something that 
doesn't really take away. dollars from the

05:52.060 --> 06:21.831
university but we can help you with bucks so did he 
promise you the chance of a scholarship later

05:52.060 --> 06:21.831
absolutely he knew my brother my brother was a full 
full boat and he'd already he'd already uh gone

05:52.060 --> 06:21.831
yeah he we're four years apart so he was basically 
graduated when i got there and he uh he didn't he

05:52.060 --> 06:21.831
signed his pro contract his third year so gave 
coach another scholarship that fourth year um all

05:52.060 --> 06:21.831
right um you you weren't in the core how Describe 
how you became assimilated into Texas A&M student

06:22.098 --> 06:27.564
body. When did that start? Oh, the day we went out 
and started throwing washers out there in front. I

06:34.552 --> 06:38.376
mean, that was just the, you know, you see these two 
cans in the ground. Of course, in West Texas, we

06:38.397 --> 06:40.619
don't know what washers are. And all of a sudden, 
these baseball, well, the rest of the baseball

06:40.639 --> 06:44.203
team showed up, you know. And my brother had a very, 
um, Colorful reputation, shall I say? I'll give

06:52.158 --> 06:53.000
you an example. We went first road trip with Coach 
Chandler to, I can't remember if it was to Baylor or

06:53.060 --> 07:08.043
somewhere, and we went to Luby's to eat, or first to 
eat, it was Luby's, and he says, okay, everybody's

06:53.060 --> 07:08.043
got a limit. Everybody, you just get whatever you 
want to eat, except Camille. He's limited $10.

07:13.552 --> 07:14.734
$10. My brother was known to eat for two or three 
players. And of course, everybody had stories

07:19.990 --> 07:24.358
about my brother. But when I got there, they all 
wanted to see Camille's little brother, Dave

07:24.378 --> 07:32.812
Elmendorf, and Long, and those guys. Who were the 
big names on the baseball team when you arrived?

07:36.618 --> 07:39.162
Well, Dave Elmendorf, Bob Long was still there. 
Butch Gootsman was there. There was a Georgia

07:43.030 --> 07:45.973
Englert I played with who went to the pros. And 
several others. I'll remember their names

07:49.996 --> 07:51.758
eventually here. Describe when you and your 
roommate got your room set up. Describe what was in

07:55.401 --> 07:57.783
the room and what it looked like. Literally 
nothing. I mean, our stereo. Because he got to

08:00.226 --> 08:02.248
bring more than I did. Whatever I had is what I had a 
whole year. I mean, I didn't have a thing. And of

08:06.431 --> 08:10.455
course, we eventually... You know, I eventually 
went out and bought a refrigerator and hid it, and

08:10.722 --> 08:17.813
we had a little bit of a toaster oven. And we hid it 
because we weren't supposed to have anything in

08:17.833 --> 08:20.517
there. How big was this refrigerator? It was a 
little underneath. We put it underneath the

08:24.002 --> 08:29.790
two-by-two, maybe the biggest, underneath the 
sink. And we, both of us, liked to eat, as you can

08:29.810 --> 08:33.115
tell. But we used to go out about once a week. drive 
the rest of the dorm crazy and we'd get us a couple of

08:36.558 --> 09:04.253
steaks at Safeway and we had a little uh for making 
popcorn we had a hot pad and we brought up got some

08:36.558 --> 09:04.253
oil and we cut up some french fries and we'd cook at 
nine o'clock at night we start cooking those

08:36.558 --> 09:04.253
steaks and we'd go to Cebisa the next morning and 
eat breakfast and John and I used to love to do this

08:36.558 --> 09:04.253
we'd walk around behind a bunch of people going to 
eat breakfast or stand in line Man, I could have

09:04.587 --> 09:10.236
sworn these people, they were in front of us 
telling us, I could have sworn I smelled steaks

09:04.587 --> 09:10.236
last night in the dorm. Somebody, I mean, we had 
steaks going. Somebody had steaks going

09:12.559 --> 09:13.942
somewhere. I was hungry all night. Well, we just, 
you know, John, that was just our weekly ritual.

09:20.592 --> 09:22.575
We'd go there. So that was one of the fun things we 
did in the dorm that we were never supposed to do.

09:28.347 --> 09:31.991
Right, let's go back to the very, very first. You 
didn't go to fish camp? Didn't go to fish camp. I

09:34.795 --> 09:36.617
don't know if there was fish camp in the city. Oh 
yeah, there was. How did you register and how did

09:39.921 --> 09:42.684
you select your courses? I went to a counselor. I 
mean, I basically got there, they gave me the

09:44.246 --> 09:49.893
packet, my registration packet down there, all 
the athletes get it. So I got my packet, they told me

09:50.053 --> 09:56.481
where to go, I went to a counselor, they basically 
walked me through Saw what I was weak in, saw what I

09:57.035 --> 10:01.281
was strong in, what my major was supposed to be. And 
you were going to major in? Architecture. It was a

10:04.706 --> 10:06.208
lifelong dream. So I got all registered and it 
really was not, that was pretty easy for me. I mean

10:15.401 --> 10:17.324
they did a real good job of getting me there. I was 
there probably a week before, I was probably there

10:18.285 --> 10:22.671
FOW week. when all the core guys were there. So none 
of the athletes, nobody else had showed up. So I

10:26.442 --> 10:27.463
walked campus. I walked to my classes. I made sure I 
knew where this building was and that building

10:29.425 --> 10:31.888
was. So I did all that at their behest. What 
impression did the campus make on you, and what

10:35.312 --> 10:39.717
made the most impression? Big. It was big. I mean, I 
never realized. You know, Austin High School is a

10:43.982 --> 10:46.485
big school for a high school. We had that quad, and 
we had, you know, we had.

10:51.845 --> 10:56.310
I did not remember it being that big when I went to 
see my brother play. So it was very interesting to

10:56.651 --> 11:00.015
see the size of it. Now what seemed new? Was there 
anything that seemed real new? No, the

11:04.139 --> 11:07.303
architecture building was brand new when my 
brother was there. So, you know, we were real

11:07.644 --> 11:09.486
fortunate. We got into a brand new building. And, 
of course, you know, there was still a lot of

11:11.768 --> 11:14.712
building going on. They were building the 
oceanography building. They were building, you

11:16.494 --> 11:20.839
know, all these things started really coming 
alive during my four years there that I saw. In

11:22.594 --> 11:25.959
fact, I worked on the oceanography building. Do 
you remember who that counselor was that you? Not

11:29.244 --> 11:29.865
at all. All right. Now, first classes. What were 
some of those classes you remember the first year?

11:40.560 --> 11:49.493
The first year was,

11:40.560 --> 11:49.493
well, I flunked four of them, so I should tell you, 
history and English were killers, especially

11:50.182 --> 11:53.647
during baseball season. I ended up having to take 
English in El Paso to make sure I got back to school

11:53.988 --> 11:59.837
next fall. I took English 101 and History. Do you 
remember any of the teachers that first year? You

12:12.507 --> 12:17.433
know, every once in a while their names will flash 
in front of me, and then somebody will tell me, did

12:12.507 --> 12:17.433
you have Song Tso? You know, I said, you know, I did. 
Of course, I had the judge, and I had my geology

12:18.895 --> 12:25.543
prof. I can't remember his name. He was an older 
prof, too, and he was funny. First thing in the day

12:30.790 --> 12:33.573
in class, he says, how many athletes do we have in 
here? Of course, half the, 90% of the class was

12:33.593 --> 12:37.178
athletes trying to get their science. And he says, 
okay, I just wanted to know that because I need to,

12:41.043 --> 12:48.333
you know, gauge this class based on what you need to 
know as opposed to what you, you know, will get you

12:41.043 --> 12:48.333
by, so. As far as you and your buddies were aware, 
were there any courses that were giveaways to

12:49.855 --> 12:56.424
athletes in those days? We just knew if we took 
geology, we could get some science credit. I took a

13:01.811 --> 13:02.953
lot of Spanish. I was fluent in Spanish, so if I 
needed an A, which I did several times, I went to

13:06.642 --> 13:10.628
Spanish. And you were fluent in Spanish, not 
because you'd taken a lot of Spanish, but because

13:10.788 --> 13:18.359
you'd grown up in El Paso. Yeah, we really knew 
Spanish before we knew English. My grandfather

13:21.604 --> 13:24.107
was an assistant. And the Spanish prof there was 
very thrilled to have me there because he was

13:25.690 --> 13:32.700
trying to teach, you know, I was kind of his 
teacher. Tell them what this means, and then help

13:33.541 --> 13:37.971
them out so that they understand this stuff. Had 
your older brother given you some advice on how to

13:37.991 --> 13:41.338
succeed at A&M? No. He was a lot smarter than I was. I 
mean, he was a math major and a psychology major, so

13:45.086 --> 13:50.899
he really didn't struggle too much. But did he tell 
you what to do or not to do? no of course he was off

13:54.719 --> 14:22.178
playing baseball i really didn't see him much and 
so he just you know he said how you like it i'm doing

13:54.719 --> 14:22.178
good he says are you passing i said yeah i'm passing 
he said that's all that matters as far as you recall

13:54.719 --> 14:22.178
what did that first year cost do you remember any oh 
we have all my old grade slips and i mean i i think it

13:54.719 --> 14:22.178
was a thousand dollars the whole year for room 
board tuition and everything and did you have any

13:54.719 --> 14:22.178
spending money yeah my dad put money in the bank 
which i went through remember how much He gave me

14:22.782 --> 14:27.087
$500 one semester and $600 the next. As spending 
money? As spending money. And that basically, you

14:29.150 --> 14:33.976
know, I had to basically take care of everything, 
which I thought was pretty good. And before you

14:35.117 --> 14:42.807
left, perhaps related to that money, did your dad 
give you any guidelines or rules?

14:46.071 --> 14:46.291
No. I mean, I worked with my dad. for about seven 
years. So he knew my money habits. I mean, he knew

14:50.731 --> 14:52.092
how he paid me. He saw what I did with my money. What 
did he do? He was in the wholesale food business.

14:55.556 --> 14:56.217
Oh, yeah, that's right. I was a truck driver. I was 
driving a truck delivering food since I was 15. And

15:00.201 --> 15:02.724
he, you know, he resigned my paycheck every week. 
And I think I was the only person that I never had one

15:02.804 --> 15:08.230
vacation. I went to college for five years or four 
and a half. And every vacation, I went home to work.

15:13.276 --> 15:16.279
And my dad said, this is your trade-off. And every 
summer I went back and worked for him. I didn't work

15:19.033 --> 15:20.955
really in my field. And you assumed you were going 
to graduate in what period of time? Well, I thought

15:25.100 --> 15:26.882
it was five years. I guess one of my rudest 
awakenings at A&M was I went to my first

15:28.364 --> 15:35.413
architecture class, and Dean Romick was there. 
And all the freshmen walked in, and he went up to the

15:36.595 --> 15:41.421
podium. He says, y'all are here to be architects? 
He says, yes. He says, well, I'm here to tell you

15:43.683 --> 15:46.587
this is the wrong place to be. He says, you do not 
need to be in the architecture profession. The

15:50.402 --> 15:52.084
architecture profession is dead. Architects, 
you know, are a dying breed. You're never going to

15:55.308 --> 15:57.431
make any money. You're never going to be 
successful. He says, you're going to be

15:59.033 --> 16:01.155
frustrated your whole life. And he says, and 
that's why we're changing this department. So all

16:06.081 --> 16:07.302
of us are saying, wait a minute. We've got our 
five-year plan here written down on our schedule

16:07.322 --> 16:11.327
sheets. And you're telling us, you know, we've got 
our book and everything else. He says, yeah,

16:14.271 --> 16:15.392
you're going to be You are now going to be 
considered ED students, which are environmental

16:16.267 --> 16:19.671
design. We want you to learn design. We want you to 
learn all these things that architects never

16:21.292 --> 16:23.995
learn. They learn how to draw straight lines. We 
want them to learn how to design first. We left. Of

16:32.124 --> 16:33.465
course, we're all scratching our heads. About 
half of the guys said, I'm out of here. I'm going to

16:35.347 --> 16:40.232
go to UT or go to some other schools. So as, you know, 
we were the guinea pig. I think our class was the

16:44.063 --> 16:50.774
first ED class that graduated, and the goal was to 
get us into graduate school. Well, that's real

16:51.575 --> 16:54.620
good if, you know, and I was. I was accepted to 
graduate school. I was planning on going to

16:56.062 --> 16:57.584
graduate school. Unfortunately, I had a father 
and a fiancé that both said I was having too much fun

16:58.446 --> 17:04.034
in college. And one of them wanted to get married, 
and one of them said, You're on your own, son. Your

17:09.780 --> 17:12.143
younger brother now is in college. So it was one of 
those things. And the degree is not, I'm not doing

17:16.208 --> 17:27.140
what I really wanted to do, but it really helped me 
focus on what I needed to do. My talent is in

17:28.602 --> 17:34.028
construction, not in design. So that's really 
where it led me, and that's what I'm doing. Now, in

17:37.030 --> 17:43.940
those first months or that first year, was there 
anyone in E.D. or architecture, whichever we

17:44.060 --> 17:50.410
title it, was there anyone to whom you began to turn 
for advice and direction? Not until my second

17:50.690 --> 17:52.012
year. The first year was pretty much. Who was it 
then, the second year? It was Larry Priesmeier. He

17:57.781 --> 18:04.832
and I, you know, he was the first one that said, Sam, 
you're not a designer. He says, you don't have you

18:06.882 --> 18:35.860
know you're not an off the wall type guy you know 
that these big firms he says you're he says you know

18:06.882 --> 18:35.860
what you'd be great if i had a firm you're a nut bolt 
guy you'd be drawing door jams your whole life

18:06.882 --> 18:35.860
because you can do it you you know but give you 
something real out you know something out there to

18:06.882 --> 18:35.860
draw he says you'll you'll struggle for 20 years he 
says you need to get and they didn't really have a

18:06.882 --> 18:35.860
construction program at that time it was it was 
just that was it so he says you need to concentrate

18:06.882 --> 18:35.860
on these things So, you know,

18:36.532 --> 18:49.804
he really kind of led me to get more into design 
build where I could, you know, design metal

18:36.532 --> 18:49.804
buildings and, you know, warehouses. And that's 
really where Where he led me so you need to learn how

18:52.124 --> 19:00.155
to build these things and you need to be a 
contractor In that first year or two were there any

18:52.124 --> 19:00.155
other? experiences you remember with somebody 
that were important As you look back I I can't

19:12.982 --> 19:21.290
remember the prof, but he was from Santa Fe, and he 
spent a lot of, it was one of those things that he saw

19:12.982 --> 19:21.290
the same thing in me that was in him. He was more of an 
outdoor person and everything else. That's what

19:24.693 --> 19:25.374
he told me. He says, you do not fit the mold of 
somebody being in the office. He says, I've been in

19:31.680 --> 19:34.223
the field for 8 or 9, 10 years. I can tell you right 
now. He left the architecture field and went to

19:35.224 --> 19:40.068
Santa Fe to live and work in the mountains and 
everything else. He says, I can sense that you're

19:42.867 --> 19:44.349
more of a hands-on guy. He said, you don't, you 
know, you work with your hands, you do things with

19:44.369 --> 19:47.233
your hands. Because I built great models. I was a 
real good model builder. I could really do the

19:50.257 --> 19:53.280
building part. Everybody wanted me as a partner so 
that I could help them build stuff. They could

19:57.766 --> 19:59.248
design it, I could build it. So as we teamed up on 
teams, you know, I always got the three guys that

20:00.189 --> 20:10.623
couldn't put a nail in a two-by-four to help, you 
know, and I would go build a thing and they'd just

20:00.189 --> 20:10.623
tell me what to build. So that's kind of how as we got 
to that year, the third year earlier. All right,

20:15.491 --> 20:18.394
back to the first year. During those first weeks, 
months, how did you and your freshman buddies

20:18.935 --> 20:25.761
learn about A&M traditions and all that? Most of 
them, I should have been at an advantage with my

20:27.243 --> 20:37.933
brother being there, but I was at a disadvantage in 
that everybody there seemed to know what to do,

20:27.243 --> 20:37.933
where to go, everything. So I followed. I did a lot 
of following. you know, like most people, and

20:40.175 --> 21:01.016
being from West Texas, way out there where I was, it 
was strange because I caught, my wife still has

20:40.175 --> 21:01.016
this in a letter, when there wasn't a football game 
on a weekend, there was two people in the dorm, me

20:40.175 --> 21:01.016
and somebody else on the back side, a swimmer from 
somewhere that didn't have transportation, so

20:40.175 --> 21:01.016
everybody else went home. You know, the campus was 
basically evacuated except the people from

21:01.997 --> 21:08.443
Mexico or, you know, the Far East or You know, so I 
basically learned real quick, you know, you need

21:08.710 --> 21:13.256
to make friends. If you don't want to spend every 
weekend that there ain't a football game on this

21:13.917 --> 21:17.882
campus. So I started making friends. I started, 
you know, enjoying going back to the little city

21:19.304 --> 21:28.657
down in Dallas and Waxahachie and places like that 
to people's houses and coming back to A&M. And as

21:28.717 --> 21:32.362
you make friends, you start making friends. Like 
half of the friends that I met on the baseball team

21:32.402 --> 21:38.270
all had friends in the Corps. Mm-hmm. So they're 
all coming over here crying, you know, the blues,

21:38.748 --> 21:43.034
you know, in their uniforms. They'd hide in our 
dormitory room. You know, these guys, I mean, what

21:44.856 --> 21:46.979
are you doing over here? I need to stay in here for 
about four hours. Just leave me alone. I'm in

21:50.123 --> 21:50.703
class. I'm in study hall. I'm doing something. 
Just leave us alone. So they'd show up in the

21:54.228 --> 22:01.217
uniforms, and pretty soon we had nine or ten or 
twelve guys, you know, in the Corps over there

21:54.228 --> 22:01.217
visiting us. So we'd start learning about the 
Corps and, of course, how hard it was and, how lucky

22:06.811 --> 22:10.876
we were that we weren't in the corps and those type 
of things. But we didn't venture much to the quad. I

22:14.540 --> 22:19.826
mean, as athletes, if you weren't in the corps, we 
just didn't venture over there too much. Now you

22:19.866 --> 22:25.192
all ate, you and your roommate ate at Sabeasa. 
Describe the routine at Sabeasa for civilian

22:25.232 --> 22:29.417
soldiers. Well, you walk in, drop your briefcase 
or your books and get in line. For me, it was, you

22:36.005 --> 22:42.432
know, strange to eat just at, you know, it wasn't 
like high school where you all had your same

22:36.005 --> 22:42.432
buddies. Every day was seeing it with somebody 
different or saw somebody different. And it was

22:45.255 --> 22:51.341
pretty much first come, first serve, you know, 
very unregulated, regimented. I didn't like the

22:52.602 --> 22:58.108
idea that you couldn't eat all day long, but, you 
know, you had to get there in time. Did you think the

22:58.168 --> 23:00.311
food was good? I thought the food was great. But any 
food to me is great. Was there, among you non-Corps

23:05.890 --> 23:10.979
members, was there mischief in the dining hall? 
Oh, there's lots of butter patties on the ceiling.

23:13.985 --> 23:16.449
We had a couple of pretty good food fights. Over 
what? Somebody said, pass something. I can't

23:22.159 --> 23:23.221
remember what it was. And you put out your hand, and 
you got a, you know, You got a whole douse of sugar or

23:27.355 --> 23:34.045
something in your hand and you throw it back and 
pretty soon it just gets going back and forth.

23:34.486 --> 23:38.592
Somebody will fling a butter patty at you across 
the room and you try to figure out who it was. And how

23:38.672 --> 23:41.696
many people maybe were involved in a food fight? 
Well, eventually everybody, I think. And was

23:44.480 --> 23:45.622
there any punishment? No, a lot of us had to clean up 
stuff. Coach Chandler showed up one day and said, I

23:48.867 --> 23:54.094
understand everybody had a good time last night at 
supper. He says, we're going to clean up over

23:54.235 --> 23:56.518
there. So, you know, it was the baseball players 
against the swimmers and the track guys one time. I

24:04.457 --> 24:04.998
know that. We all had supper, and basically 
everybody was there at the bus. Did he say, it's not

24:07.923 --> 24:10.147
going to happen again? No. He just said, you're 
going to go clean it up. And he told them, he said,

24:16.038 --> 24:18.743
you all don't touch that stuff. He says, I'm 
sending some boys back over there. They're going

24:21.168 --> 24:22.709
to clean up for you. So we got to clean up. All right. 
What did you soon assume to be some guidelines for

24:25.892 --> 24:35.782
you about going to class and behavior and dress and 
homework and so forth?

24:37.964 --> 24:45.592
My roommate wouldn't agree to it, but I learned 
real quick you try to get as much done before you got

24:37.964 --> 24:45.592
back to the dorm as possible. I did, where I went to 
the library. Because once I got back to the dorm,

24:49.688 --> 24:57.099
You know, studying was out the window, you know, 
and everybody playing cards and playing baseball

24:49.688 --> 24:57.099
games in the rooms and stuff like that. So if I 
wanted, I lived in the architecture building. So

25:01.306 --> 25:08.076
basically, I mean, I stayed there as long as I 
possibly could because once I got back to my dorm

25:01.306 --> 25:08.076
room, I never cracked a book. I mean, as an honest to 
God, I never read a book. If I was going to read or

25:10.319 --> 25:13.244
study, I'd go to the library. And this is the old 
Cushing Library. This is the old Cushing Library.

25:17.450 --> 25:18.852
I fell asleep many times in there. Did you ever know 
of any mischief there? No. I never saw and I never

25:23.488 --> 25:24.990
did any. Nobody else has either. I just don't, you 
know, you just went there. Everybody was too busy

25:28.314 --> 25:30.958
trying to get their studying done. I guess they 
felt the same way once they got back to their dorm.

25:37.767 --> 25:40.711
Give me a description of a typical class day. What 
time did you get up? What did you do when? From

25:44.697 --> 25:48.602
getting up to going to bed, describe a typical day. 
Usually I always got an 8 o'clock class.

25:50.885 --> 25:52.387
Architecture classes are four hours. So 
baseball, we always had to have that class first in

25:52.407 --> 25:55.431
the morning. So I'd get up, you know, John and I 
would get up and go to breakfast, and I'd just take

25:55.451 --> 26:01.599
off from there and go down to the architecture 
building. I'd stay there for three hours. Then I

26:04.162 --> 26:06.665
hit my next, you know, I had a class. I never had a, my 
first freshman year, I never had an hour in between

26:06.685 --> 26:13.855
classes because we had fall ball and we had to be out 
there by 2 o'clock. So I had class 11, I had class 12,

26:14.115 --> 26:17.880
I had class 1 by 2 o'clock. I was hooking it up to the 
baseball field to get my cleats on and my stuff, get

26:19.160 --> 26:26.927
ready to play ball, and we'd finish that up. And 
when fall ball wasn't there, we just basically,

26:28.129 --> 26:34.575
when we weren't playing baseball, we'd go back to 
the dorm or go work out. We'd go back to the dorm and

26:34.595 --> 26:36.717
have supper. Everybody walked to supper 
together, and about 8 o'clock, we'd start

26:36.737 --> 26:41.822
playing. I mean, guys would start playing cards 
and At what time would y'all go to bed? Midnight.

26:49.096 --> 26:50.579
11, 30, 12. Did you go to class every day? I mean, I 
had class scheduled every day. I didn't make it

26:55.387 --> 26:57.811
every day. Oh, you did cut some classes? Oh, yeah. I 
was right on the ragged edge. My freshman year, I

27:02.358 --> 27:04.742
was, you know, half the time I was Especially 
English and history. Do you remember who you had

27:07.800 --> 27:09.001
for history? I could probably look at my records, 
but I don't remember who it was. Because I was still

27:13.226 --> 27:24.619
teaching a big fresh 105 at 8 o'clock on Tuesday and 
Thursday over in either in physics or in Zachary. I

27:24.639 --> 27:25.641
might have had you. I was a horrible student. Did 
you turn to anybody for academic advice during

27:27.183 --> 27:33.249
that semester? Hey, what do I do? Well, Coach 
Chandler got me help all the time. He knew all the

27:37.113 --> 27:39.776
freshmen were struggling. He knew I was going to 
struggle. He warned me. He says, it's almost

27:42.058 --> 27:48.045
impossible for an architecture student to be an 
athlete. He says, they demand more of your time to

27:48.065 --> 27:53.891
be down there in the labs than we do. He says, they 
want you there. learning, you know, everything.

27:57.595 --> 27:58.800
So he said, you're going to struggle. And for two 
years, I did struggle. And then I decided it was

28:01.913 --> 28:03.921
enough baseball. It was either, you know, One time 
I had to go, and it was obviously baseball. During

28:10.851 --> 28:18.660
that first year, did you and your buddies go to Yale 
practice? Oh, yeah, we had Yale practice right out

28:18.680 --> 28:20.723
in front of our dorm. Okay. Several times. Okay. 
So, yeah, we... What about midnight Yale

28:22.905 --> 28:25.108
practice? Yes, we'd go to midnight Yale practice, 
and we were known to dive off the three-meter,

28:25.128 --> 28:33.037
three, is it the three-meter board? Mm-hmm. The 
platform. Mm-hmm. It was condemned. That was one

28:37.555 --> 28:42.903
of our, we'd go over there with the swimmers and 
dive off that thing at 2 or 3 in the morning after

28:37.555 --> 28:42.903
midnight. Campus police come screaming down 
there, what are y'all, you guys, that thing is

28:43.965 --> 28:50.556
condemned, it's going to fall down. And what would 
y'all be wearing when you did that? Our clothes,

28:53.279 --> 28:57.005
full clothes, whatever we had on at the time. They 
just come by, hey, we're going to go die. You guys

28:59.148 --> 29:00.250
want to come? All right, now that sounds like that 
might have been physically dangerous. Looking

29:04.176 --> 29:08.562
back on it, did you all do any other pranks that you 
now realize were dangerous?

29:11.427 --> 29:21.022
Oh, I wouldn't call it dangerous, but I think we had 
a band my second year over there. Baseball players

29:21.042 --> 29:22.003
had a Charlie Jenkins was a drummer. Had another 
guy down the road play saxophone, I played guitar,

29:25.972 --> 29:34.203
and we got a couple of core guys for the band that 
wanted to play, and we started playing one night.

29:35.304 --> 29:45.118
It was 11, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, we're out on the 
stoop, you know, we're just rocking along, just

29:35.304 --> 29:45.118
had everybody downstairs below just having a good 
old time. All of a sudden, one guy stopped playing,

29:45.138 --> 29:50.725
the other guy stopped playing, and Because half us 
are in the room, half us are out of the room. We're

29:53.788 --> 29:56.151
trying to figure out how all these people are kind 
of moving down the stoop. And in comes Gene

29:57.413 --> 29:58.694
Stallings. And he says, boys, you sound great. He 
says, I love the music. I said, but I got some

30:07.526 --> 30:13.354
players across the way that need to get their sleep 
because they're going to play a football game on

30:07.526 --> 30:13.354
Saturday. He says, I don't want you to stop ever 
playing the music. I just want you to stop tonight.

30:23.689 --> 30:28.594
So he walked, you know, and everybody, you know, 
we're just all shaking in our boots. Chandler's

30:29.094 --> 30:30.796
going to hear about it now. And, you know, of 
course, Tom had it. I said, I heard you guys were

30:32.277 --> 30:36.101
serenading the football players the other night, 
boys. He said, we're not going to have that again. I

30:38.443 --> 30:40.345
said, we'll stop early, Coach. We'll stop early. 
So that was not a, it was a very threatening thing

30:41.266 --> 30:47.712
because Gene was a man of very few words. And all he 
had to do, and everybody was starting to pack up

30:48.198 --> 30:51.001
their stuff. We knew we had done something wrong, 
so we just started putting our stuff away. We had a

30:56.306 --> 31:01.572
little contest one year, and these were the older 
baseball players when I was there. The football

31:02.433 --> 31:06.477
players would get on top of Henderson on the roof. 
And we'd get on top of Fowler on the roof with our

31:08.659 --> 31:14.425
golf clubs and our golf balls. Yeah, we'd have 
little... I wouldn't say mortar launches.
