WEBVTT

00:01.853 --> 00:02.434
civilians. Some of the civilians were World War II 
physically disabled paratroopers, you know,

00:02.454 --> 00:09.081
that type of thing. But we had some civilians that 
had never been in the military. Was your friend

00:12.665 --> 00:14.607
right that it was a dead end? No. That was one of the 
most interesting three years I'd ever spent.

00:22.836 --> 00:27.962
Official reports were, in fact, I was recommended 
for general officer by the by my boss and his boss,

00:29.039 --> 00:35.910
and then we had a retired General Jeff Ballmer, 
who's deceased now. He too gave me a plug, so. The

00:38.614 --> 00:44.143
tour was cut short because I went to, was selected 
for the War College. Now, during this time, Allen

00:44.944 --> 00:48.490
Dulles was in charge of the CIA. Did you have any 
work with him? Yep. Could you describe him? Tell me

00:52.116 --> 00:52.797
about him. What kind of relations did you have with 
Mr. Dulles? He was a real character. Interesting,

00:59.799 --> 01:01.601
colorful character, I mean. When I say character, 
I usually mean a positive rather than a colorful

01:01.681 --> 01:05.967
character. Deep voice, talked loud, laughed a 
lot. I remember one time we were having an

01:10.714 --> 01:20.086
exercise,

01:10.714 --> 01:20.086
which we used to have in the government. We don't do 
it anymore. On evacuation war, you know,

01:21.268 --> 01:23.511
evacuations. Of course, they will get back around 
to that pretty soon. And we were having this

01:27.612 --> 01:46.532
exercise out in the area and so in our scenario we 
had a situation that we had written for Fabricate

01:27.612 --> 01:46.532
Fiction of what could happen and some of the 
personalities involved their reaction, like

01:47.525 --> 01:51.952
some of them would get killed and so forth, take on 
like that. And old Allen Dulles, I don't know how

01:52.052 --> 01:59.022
much he knows or experienced, he's had wargaming 
action, that's what this is, with civilians

01:52.052 --> 01:59.022
seldom ever do. He really got a kick. He was just 
coming by to visit, but he got so involved with

02:01.326 --> 02:13.905
that, he wanted to sit down and listen to the whole 
thing, and then return and say, by the way,

02:01.326 --> 02:13.905
whatever happened, just like it actually was in 
process, whatever happened to so-and-so. Was he a

02:15.968 --> 02:16.789
good leader? Yeah, I think so. Of course, his 
advantage was he had such prestige on the national

02:18.392 --> 02:35.011
level, see, with his brother being Secretary of 
State, and the two men, Eisenhower, I thought, was

02:18.392 --> 02:35.011
very close to him. He had a sister, too, that was a 
real strong individual, which I never did know

02:35.031 --> 02:39.376
her. She was involved in a lot of diplomatic action 
in Europe. Was there a lot of,

02:47.245 --> 02:59.461
I should say, how did the Secretary of State and the 
CIA Director, how did they get along together?

03:00.042 --> 03:06.691
What were the relations between the CIA and the 
State Department?

03:06.711 --> 03:09.194
Well, you aren't talking about the two brothers. 
You're talking about any Secretary of State. No,

03:11.877 --> 03:15.362
I'm just talking about what the relations were 
with the CIA. and the State Department during the

03:15.663 --> 03:18.407
time that you were there? Oh, during? Yeah. I think 
they're very good. You see, because, see, he's the

03:24.815 --> 03:30.884
director of Central Intelligence. Sure. Which 
includes, see, the State Department's got an

03:33.187 --> 03:43.881
intelligence department, and, of course, the 
services plus the defense intelligence. And,

03:43.901 --> 03:44.522
uh... I never, I wasn't aware of any friction at all 
between us. Because we had, we had joint groups at

03:53.070 --> 03:55.233
work. I've

03:55.393 --> 04:14.678
already forgotten the name now, but nearly every 
operation that'd be planned,

03:55.393 --> 04:14.678
not all of them, there'd be certain ones that 
probably wouldn't, but any one of them, national

04:15.265 --> 04:25.941
significance would be worked out and cleared in 
this particular working group of CIA, state, and

04:15.265 --> 04:25.941
the defense that represented them. And you 
obviously haven't necessarily because all of

04:26.341 --> 04:41.003
them have other plans and you can really foul up 
things royally if you get somebody that's going

04:26.341 --> 04:41.003
splashing around in some environment where 
somebody else has made plans and is working with

04:26.341 --> 04:41.003
them. But there was never any competition, nor was 
there any at that time when I was there, as I was

04:43.227 --> 04:48.721
aware of. They thought that the CIA was

04:51.107 --> 05:00.510
running their own national policy.

05:03.494 --> 05:05.136
The Bay of Pigs, of course, came along. That wasn't 
while I was there. That came in 61, but there were a

05:06.477 --> 05:11.243
couple of interesting incidents that happened. 
One was the invasion, the Soviet invasion of

05:11.263 --> 05:17.329
Hungary in 1956 when you were there. Do you 
remember that? I mean, what was the CIA's response

05:18.791 --> 05:21.033
to that? And did you have to have war plans for that? 
No. Our war plans were coordinating our U.S.

05:25.658 --> 05:32.706
assets, military, which obviously we don't have 
in Hungary, we don't have in Poland. Right, okay.

05:35.877 --> 06:00.703
with no i don't i don't worry i guess i recall more 
reading the papers than anything else hungry

05:35.877 --> 06:00.703
what about that it just seemed it seemed as i recall 
back in those days not from the cia knowledge but uh

05:35.877 --> 06:00.703
cia might have been involved in that we had we had 
led the Hungarians to believe that we might come to

06:01.493 --> 06:06.318
their aid if they resisted.

06:09.041 --> 06:23.558
And I think that was all based on the propaganda on 
the radio, whether it was the CIA's radio, whether

06:09.041 --> 06:23.558
it was our information program, and then we didn't 
produce. Right. What about Lebanon? Eisenhower

06:27.783 --> 06:29.965
sending the troops in? Well, I was in Europe then. 
And how about the problems with, the problems that

06:33.259 --> 06:42.252
were growing with Laos and especially Vietnam? I 
wasn't involved

06:42.453 --> 06:48.221
in that. I mean, in CIA I

06:48.241 --> 06:53.950
wasn't. Later on I was, because not only was it the 
military, recommended against us, any

07:00.218 --> 07:04.583
involvement. And the same thing we did in Korea, 
the same thing we did in Vietnam.

07:12.051 --> 07:13.432
Did you enjoy working with the CIA? Yeah. What did 
you do? And I found those Ivy League people that

07:15.114 --> 07:17.797
they talked about. You see, like we talked about 
other things in combat, perceiving things. Now,

07:23.123 --> 07:30.090
this individual here, probably he was, the 
problem was, like we met the enemy and He is us, you

07:30.610 --> 07:31.652
know. I think that individual was a problem. He 
couldn't get along with these people, see, and so

07:34.978 --> 07:50.627
he views them as being the villains rather than 
himself because, no, I was working with Helms, you

07:34.978 --> 07:50.627
know, who later on was the, he was a real fine guy and 
easy to get along with. I found just the opposite of

07:51.738 --> 07:55.261
it. What else? Was there anything that struck you 
about Helms, the type of person he was? He was a

08:02.067 --> 08:04.629
smooth operator. What do you mean? He was a real 
sophisticated individual, a debonair. Both

08:11.715 --> 08:21.643
he and his wife were very impressive individuals.

08:23.817 --> 08:28.523
He's

08:23.817 --> 08:28.523
a cultured lady. In other words, he moves very well 
in high society. At

08:38.157 --> 08:48.070
first, he was head of the Condescension Service, 
the CDI. This character has just been fired. And he

08:52.256 --> 08:53.638
worked very well with Dulles. Of course, Dulles 
was over, as you know, CIA is divided in two. You've

08:57.691 --> 08:58.352
got D.D. Allen and Kolesnick, and then you have the 
other, which is overt intelligence, where you

08:58.372 --> 09:08.506
have all the scientists and guys like you, you 
know, who really study all of this. They can tell

09:08.806 --> 09:23.305
you everything about agriculture and each of the, 
any part of the USSR, what's happening in Siberia,

09:08.806 --> 09:23.305
and oil, although some say their oil estimate was 
incorrect. It seems to me scientific. They may

09:28.615 --> 09:32.281
really have a tremendous talent. That's the thing 
that impressed me when I got to CIA. How do you

09:35.066 --> 09:38.531
attract this type of talent? I'm talking about now 
intellectual talent. So I can see, they say, I

09:42.838 --> 09:48.668
believe, obviously, a lot from Harvard. 
intrigued, I think, some of these people for this

09:49.002 --> 10:00.612
type of work, particularly the research, the 
scientific point, which, of course, enables

09:49.002 --> 10:00.612
these to write papers. Of course, they're 
classified, but it's a lot of personal

10:00.952 --> 10:05.156
satisfaction. What opinion did you have? And 
you're sort of alluding to this now, but I'd like to

10:08.499 --> 10:12.883
answer on this. And that is, your opinion of the top 
level civilian bureaucrats at the CIA What did you

10:18.854 --> 10:20.195
think of them? When I was there, I thought they were 
tops because they were selected on ability. See,

10:25.461 --> 10:27.804
like Heldner, he was a career man. He had been there 
for years, so he knew everything about it. But when

10:35.352 --> 10:47.646
you pull in a political appointee, like this 
recent disaster, like I saw a cartoon today, they

10:35.352 --> 10:47.646
asked him questions about, yes, I'm a friend with 
the president. And what else you did? Well, my

10:50.041 --> 10:53.866
company made paper clips of it. They said, fine, 
and you're qualified to be at the CIA. And Dulles,

11:00.574 --> 11:04.779
of course, was more of a political appointee. 
However, he'd been in the business for years. He

11:07.363 --> 11:12.068
goes all the way back to World War II. And he'd been 
in Washington. He knew his way around in

11:13.891 --> 11:16.654
Washington. I think it was a big mistake, and 
Stansfield Turner, for example, he's a very

11:17.596 --> 11:44.278
capable Navy admiral and that sort of thing, but he 
tried to organize CIA like the Navy, and you can't

11:17.596 --> 11:44.278
do that, and you can't deal with these, I call them 
Ivy League, and I don't, Ivy League got a lot from

11:17.596 --> 11:44.278
California, from Caltech, but you can't expect 
them to respond to you if you treat everybody as if

11:44.697 --> 11:49.324
they're a military organization.

11:51.848 --> 11:54.932
So basically you had a high opinion of the 
bureaucrats. Yeah. But not a very high opinion of

11:56.354 --> 12:01.001
many of the political appointments. That's 
right. It comes in. Because it shows. If you have

12:04.847 --> 12:07.911
time to teach them, you know, I own the job 
training. But

12:08.752 --> 12:13.860
see, they've run into all these people all over. My 
friend, who I can't remember his name, I'll talk

12:14.566 --> 12:19.271
about that when we get to the joint staff. He became 
head of CIA, and he was a career man. But they

12:25.817 --> 12:28.680
accused him of being too honest. He went to 
Congress and told them all about everything. In

12:32.864 --> 12:41.653
the long run, he probably helped CIA more doing 
that than getting up there and trying to double

12:32.864 --> 12:41.653
talk and say, well, I'm just not free to discuss 
this. But he's no longer there. Of course, he's

12:45.241 --> 12:47.363
appalled by what's happening in the CIA. Because 
it becomes just like a family, as I say. What's his

12:51.567 --> 12:53.029
name? Maybe I'll think of it later on. I can't think 
of it now. What was he? He's a previous...

13:01.076 --> 13:02.057
He followed Hale. He's before Turner, really. Do 
you remember who that was? No, he was quit. He was

13:09.865 --> 13:10.105
free. Yeah, because Carter changed him, you know, 
because after all he'd been there during the Nixon

13:11.519 --> 13:19.932
years. Now in 1958 you left the CIA and went to the 
Army War College. What was your opinion of that

13:29.347 --> 13:32.211
college?

13:37.422 --> 13:39.725
Well, of course, I'm a little biased to be in the 
Army. I thought it was a real fine. Because it

13:42.590 --> 13:47.758
enabled you, to begin with, there's no 
examination. This is the year that you go there to

13:48.779 --> 13:53.306
think, to study. The only requirement is that you 
must write a thesis.

14:00.937 --> 14:03.281
And it has to be a thesis. And it has been accepted. I 
never did submit mine, but it has been accepted for

14:06.481 --> 14:14.752
a master's degree, of course, if you do the other 
subject. But the problem is that most of them are

14:14.772 --> 14:22.983
classified, so they have to be rewritten to 
declassify them, or they have to wait several

14:14.772 --> 14:22.983
years. And so that, too, is very interesting 
because, as any thesis is supposed to be, is an

14:24.746 --> 14:34.038
original creative thing where you really 
research it. And so it's really interesting

14:36.029 --> 14:40.997
to do the research. Of course, you have to do that 
all during the academic year, so most of that's

14:41.077 --> 14:44.803
done at night. So it's not an easy course at all. But 
it's national strategy. This is a place you have an

14:51.334 --> 15:00.990
opportunity to relate weaponry with economy, 
economics.

15:03.637 --> 15:06.842
So at the end, you should have, and you use them. A 
lot of civilians come in. And at the end, we have a

15:09.547 --> 15:19.023
national seminar where you bring in all these 
people from Washington, the Secretary of State, a

15:09.547 --> 15:19.023
whole range of them. The Secretary of State, of 
course, doesn't have time to participate, but you

15:19.043 --> 15:28.378
have people who participate in that seminar, but 
you also have some guest speakers I guess you'd

15:29.894 --> 15:31.916
call that an enrichment program. They come and add 
to and agree or disagree with what the national

15:32.016 --> 15:45.532
seminar has come up as a national strategy for the 
direction we should be going. Is it feasible? Is it

15:46.353 --> 15:47.214
attainable? And all that. An entire year is moved 
along in that way, which is supposed to result in a

15:49.637 --> 15:58.247
product

16:00.809 --> 16:11.567
that's qualified and eligible to move at the 
highest level of government, whether it be state,

16:00.809 --> 16:11.567
CIA, national defense. And you have students. We 
have CIA there. We have State Department there. We

16:16.234 --> 16:18.518
have Army and Navy, Marine. The

16:20.221 --> 16:26.631
USIA, they usually have one there, 
informational. I've often heard that the war

16:28.231 --> 16:38.902
colleges are almost mandatory for one to be 
promoted to generalship. That's pretty good.

16:43.146 --> 16:46.389
There have been some promoted, but you'd have to 
look a long while. And that's the reason why the

16:47.631 --> 16:56.820
career ladder is a lot being written about that now 
in our periodicals.

16:58.336 --> 17:27.702
those who it has to really do for the 20-year 
retirement which is critical now because it's

16:58.336 --> 17:27.702
very costly and then you get into the double 
dippers why does a person get out after 20 years at

16:58.336 --> 17:27.702
20 years of course he gets half his retirement is 
half of his base pay he's still young enough to get

16:58.336 --> 17:27.702
another job some got another job in government So 
they become what they call double-dippers, see?

17:31.607 --> 17:34.791
Although he can't draw all of his other pay, 
there's a limit. He gets about half of it,

17:35.772 --> 17:37.715
something like that. I'm not aware of it. I've not 
been following that. Well, why do they retire?

17:42.961 --> 17:48.227
I've just told you that I'm going to say what you've 
already concluded in court. But that time, if they

17:49.268 --> 17:54.735
haven't been to the Armed Forces Staff College or 
the Army War College or the Naval War College,

17:54.968 --> 17:59.295
National War College, or the Air Force. We have 
Army going to all of those, you know, the same as

17:59.315 --> 18:03.781
Navy. And they all have the same equipment as far as 
credit is concerned. Then they feel that they're

18:10.351 --> 18:19.445
not going to, their chances of making general 
officer, even those who go, the chances of making

18:10.351 --> 18:19.445
general officer. I look at my classmate. We had 200 
in my class, and I think we had, uh, 10 who made

18:24.348 --> 18:27.371
general loss in that class. Some classes go as high 
as 20, some as low as 5 or something. Another reason

18:34.600 --> 18:48.216
why the Army has never discouraged that is because 
many of those who stay in for 20 years are

18:34.600 --> 18:48.216
non-regular and we need them and they're very 
capable and they're good. We certainly don't want

18:49.477 --> 18:52.060
to expand our regular Army to And then find out 
later on you've got a contractor, a constrictor.

18:58.077 --> 19:00.199
So it appeals to them. They stand for 20 years. And 
do you think that it prepared you for a general

19:02.942 --> 19:07.306
officer slot? I mean, did it give you the type of 
education that a general officer should have? I

19:13.713 --> 19:14.834
think so. See the two of your students. Just like I 
had been to CIA and worked with them. Many of your

19:21.800 --> 19:31.109
students have been in the Pentagon, and they bring 
a lot of experience to that that shares with others

19:21.800 --> 19:31.109
who may not have operated at that level, see. And 
some are real good writers. In fact, we have a

19:34.752 --> 19:38.275
problem with that. They only have about 15 to 20 
minutes to go in there and write their position,

19:38.295 --> 19:43.459
you know. And you have some who experience that, 
boy, they just sit down and gifted writers that can

19:49.263 --> 19:53.788
put concepts and ideas together on the first 
draft. Well, I couldn't do that, but I could learn a

19:55.930 --> 20:01.436
lot from their approach to it. And you get all these 
together, sharing, and I say it's the end of the

20:02.698 --> 20:07.323
year. It's really been a fun experience for me. And 
I agree that it does, certainly. I thought I was

20:15.959 --> 20:21.965
better prepared after that if I were to be 
selected. I didn't think I was ever going to be

20:21.985 --> 20:33.637
selected for colonel, I didn't mention that, but 
in Iran, having not been in Korea when I went there

20:21.985 --> 20:33.637
on a staff visit for a month, and all these other 
people, you know, that really had gone through a

20:21.985 --> 20:33.637
lot. But I was selected for it, and I couldn't 
believe it when the sergeant came in and said, sir,

20:34.538 --> 20:39.103
you're on the colonel's list. And now still, after 
graduating from the War College, I hadn't been to

20:43.415 --> 20:48.019
Korea, and the chances are with all these other 
outstanding officers. See, the problem is, what

20:48.159 --> 20:50.241
system? How can you possibly select, say, 50 a 
year? That's about what we got in the Army. 50 a year

20:56.426 --> 21:00.990
out of all those qualified colonels. That's where 
luck comes into it a lot, because they all have

21:01.010 --> 21:09.378
outstanding efficiency reports.

21:09.398 --> 21:11.920
Because I've been on boards selecting... 
Selecting majors to lieutenant colonels. And I'm

21:15.958 --> 21:20.645
telling you, you go through all those records, and 
you've got to come up with a limited number. And you

21:21.566 --> 21:23.549
really do a lot of soul searching. Of course, you 
have a team. They all look at it, and they all vote

21:25.531 --> 21:27.975
what it amounts to. You know, what do you vote this 
or not? Then you have to come back and work at it

21:29.918 --> 21:31.740
again. And it is really a difficult job. And at one 
time, it used to be selecting by name, like a Like we

21:41.026 --> 21:46.353
talked about, General Marshall practically 
selected all of the division commanders by name.

21:47.494 --> 21:48.495
It isn't that way now. Colonel to Brigadier 
General is strictly by record with this group

21:49.096 --> 21:56.285
working on it. There's no doubt it helps you if you 
happen to have somebody that you served under and

21:56.305 --> 22:02.672
he says, oh, I know this individual here. He is 
really top notch. He might have an advantage over

22:07.317 --> 22:14.644
another, but they said, well, he's got an 
outstanding record, but I don't know if any of you

22:07.317 --> 22:14.644
know him. No, but I say, I know this guy here who 
raided him, and I know the type of raider he is, and

22:16.065 --> 22:23.412
if he says he's good, then he is.

22:27.236 --> 22:30.519
Well, for the War College, you want to go to the next 
one? Yeah, in 1958, then you went to Fort Riley,

22:30.539 --> 22:32.961
Kansas. Right. What was your job there? Once 
again, career management came to the Army War

22:36.697 --> 22:43.946
College like they did at the Armed Forces Staff 
College. Before the end of the course, I would call

22:43.966 --> 22:49.452
them prima donnas. They're all jockeying for 
position, you know, because everybody's in the

22:49.472 --> 22:55.179
running, you know. All the students are jockeying 
for position? Well, some of them, you know, for

22:57.161 --> 23:02.387
assignments because, you know, the next one is 
very, very important. Sure. And they want to be

23:03.428 --> 23:04.590
with troops. You've got to command, see. command 
the unit. That's another thing along with the

23:08.298 --> 23:10.521
school. So these guys were going to the Pentagon 
because they all had contacts there, you know,

23:12.724 --> 23:17.490
checking on it. They'd come back and say, yeah, it 
looks like I'm going to get a command. They asked

23:23.017 --> 23:25.380
me, and I said, no, I don't know. Well, haven't you 
been there? No, I haven't been there. But chances

23:28.144 --> 23:30.047
are I won't get one. But I'll go ahead and let the 
chips fall. So here comes General Ben Harold, who

23:38.425 --> 23:44.892
headed the career management that I had served 
with at Fort Benning in Italy, really. He's a third

23:45.653 --> 23:47.215
division. So he came up, and I hadn't even talked to 
him, but I spoke to him. And so he named off those who

23:50.899 --> 23:54.223
got command. And he says, Colonel Andrews to the 
first division at Fort Raleigh, command Johnson.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.395
And my friends all came around the end, and he said, 
Rascal, you knew this all this time, and you was

24:06.370 --> 24:09.634
keeping us quiet. I said, no, I didn't have a clue. 
I'm as surprised as you are. And some of them didn't

24:13.559 --> 24:15.241
get their command. So I went to Fort Riley, and I was 
assigned as the commanding officer of the 1st

24:16.242 --> 24:23.492
Battle Group 18th Infantry. Yet at the time,

24:23.512 --> 24:34.926
a colonel who was going to become chief of staff 
didn't want to leave the 18th, and the generals

24:23.512 --> 24:34.926
supported him, so I took command of the division 
trains. What does that mean, division trains?

24:38.318 --> 24:44.468
They're the support, the supporting division, 
you know, the quartermaster and all of that. You

24:45.850 --> 24:49.777
have the combat arms and then you have all of the 
support division. Now, at that organization, at

24:49.857 --> 24:56.407
that time, they were called division trains. So I 
stayed there for about A couple of months, I guess,

24:58.632 --> 25:00.875
before. And that was good experience because that 
gave me an opportunity to work for the services.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.703
I've been infantry all my life. Then I took the 
first battle group. And the reason why I was due for

25:11.589 --> 25:25.107
an overseas assignment, so that's the reason I got 
this, because the 1st Division, at least the 1st

25:11.589 --> 25:25.107
Battle Group, 18th Infantry, was going to move to 
Germany. And they had a program called Gyroscope.

25:28.754 --> 25:37.902
We were supposed to replace a battle group in 
Germany, and that battle group would come back to

25:28.754 --> 25:37.902
Raleigh in the 1st Division, and we would go to the 
8th Division. That was Operation Charter School.

25:39.303 --> 25:41.806
Yeah, that's what they called Charter School. So 
we trained there. And the battle group was

25:45.249 --> 25:52.876
terrific, and not because of me, although, of 
course, I'd like to think I was a brilliant leader

25:45.249 --> 25:52.876
that did it. But we trained our own recruits, and 
our take of these young men Came from California.

26:03.067 --> 26:04.529
Most of them just out of high school. They hadn't 
been contaminated by anybody else. Hadn't been

26:08.554 --> 26:13.661
called, you know, like they do in most training 
centers to recruit. You know, they pick out the

26:13.681 --> 26:17.306
higher IQ types. They go to one place and they call 
through them. And then sometimes I say

26:20.811 --> 26:22.493
contaminate them. They get them, the training is 
wrong. You'll have a really receptive young man.

26:27.140 --> 26:29.423
He becomes bitter because of the way he's been 
treated. But we didn't have it. We got it at Fort

26:31.337 --> 26:34.561
Riley, right out of high school. Some of them had 
finished college. Some had two years of college

26:36.484 --> 26:42.593
and decided, even though that maybe they could. 
See, this was before Vietnam. But they decided

26:46.038 --> 26:49.863
that they would fulfill their obligation. Really 
tough. We trained them. Every bit of the training

26:54.610 --> 26:58.035
they had, we gave it to them. And then we took them to 
Europe. And they were receptive, for example.

27:04.005 --> 27:09.211
There's always a big drive on to purchase a savings 
bond. And I appealed to these young men. I said,

27:12.013 --> 27:14.536
now, you'll be in two years. You might as well save 
this money, because a lot of you are going to

27:15.036 --> 27:19.981
college or finishing college. And this will be 
saved. And that's the best advice I can give you,

27:23.765 --> 27:28.650
because you'll be assured of this amount of money. 
They signed up 100%. It is the size of the battle

27:30.980 --> 27:32.643
group. Let me see now, we had five come in, around 
1,200 men. 1,200 men? Did you, what did you think

27:41.619 --> 27:46.308
about being a commander? This is really the first 
time that you ever got a group like this, did you?

27:51.517 --> 27:55.304
Well, of course, I commanded a battalion in World 
War II. But I mean the first peacetime. And of

27:57.448 --> 28:02.397
course, this was larger in numbers than the 
battalion. Well, of course, I was thrilled.

28:05.482 --> 28:14.098
Everybody,

28:05.482 --> 28:14.098
I shouldn't say everybody, most Army types of 
these, Well, it's the same thing in the Navy. The

28:16.404 --> 28:23.434
Navy wants the command of a ship, and the Air Force 
wants the command of a squadron, you know, where

28:16.404 --> 28:23.434
you run your... It's the biggest thrill is what you 
strive for, to command, to have a unit of your own,

28:23.454 --> 28:36.232
and working with the officers, and having them to 
respond to you. And it's the highest-rated corps

28:36.252 --> 28:41.259
in that battle group, 18th Infantry. It has a long 
history. It's one of the oldest units. in the Army.

28:48.176 --> 28:55.066
So it was a high spree to court when I got there, so 
I'm not the one who bolted and built and shooted up.

28:56.348 --> 29:03.979
Of course, they were understrength, and so most of 
our, and those who weren't eligible to go

28:56.348 --> 29:03.979
overseas, they transferred out. So basically, we 
had non-commissioned officers and officers, and

29:04.540 --> 29:12.992
we brought in these recruits and trained them. So 
it's really our unit. We didn't get a bunch of

29:14.830 --> 29:20.539
transfer, you know, the troublemakers.

29:21.180 --> 29:22.382
Were there major problems? No. Not at all. Some of 
the other units, yes. So we moved, well, I'll give

29:27.990 --> 29:30.434
you a problem, yes.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.704
They publicized the gyroscope program. And so 
some of the sergeants that we got transferred in to

29:41.592 --> 29:45.879
become part of the gyroscope. They had married 
German girls in Germany. So the German girls, of

29:49.785 --> 29:53.351
course, wanted to go back to Germany. This was 
their opportunity. And many of them had a very

29:56.656 --> 30:07.093
unfortunate experience in the United States 
because then mixed marriages, you know, at that

29:56.656 --> 30:07.093
time you still, anybody on TV couldn't couldn't 
kiss, for example, like they do now, you know, like

30:07.512 --> 30:13.921
a guest on a tour. And so to be married, and 
unfortunately some of these were southern

30:13.941 --> 30:21.131
blacks, in some states it's against the law, you 
know. They're actually, they couldn't even live

30:21.171 --> 30:23.815
there. They lived there, they got arrested. So 
this gave them an opportunity to go home. Yet we

30:29.002 --> 30:31.686
didn't have space for them. In other words, we were 
overstrength and we were only going to ship out

30:32.547 --> 30:37.013
with the our signs, our authorized strength, 
T-O-N-E. So it meant some of those weren't going to

30:42.317 --> 30:48.465
be able to travel with us, go with us. Gosh, we had a 
couple of German wives, they went to see Mimi,

30:48.485 --> 30:56.714
appealed to them, please, some of them would come 
to see me. Of course, the sergeants did. But for

31:00.218 --> 31:07.607
some reason, fortunately, they didn't go with us, 
but they went as replacements to Europe. They

31:07.891 --> 31:09.774
shipped them out since they had to. And that took a 
lot of bureaucratic work to get that authorized.

31:14.060 --> 31:19.568
But they could still go as replacements in a pool, 
not necessarily in 18th Avenue, but somewhere

31:14.060 --> 31:19.568
else. So it turned out all right. But that was a 
difficult problem. But we had one ship. Oh, no,

31:28.702 --> 31:33.549
everybody's really high, including the draftee 
to go to Europe. It's the best thing that could

31:33.829 --> 31:36.413
happen to them for their concern. And it was 
because they could travel. This was really an

31:38.523 --> 31:43.571
experience for a young man at gun expense. And they 
liked the military because we had parades. We

31:48.057 --> 31:54.988
tried to make it not drudgery, but they, it's their 
unit, you know. And you even appeal to them and they

31:55.008 --> 31:57.252
respond to it. We don't want an AWL. And you can 
influence others. If you find somebody that's

32:05.654 --> 32:35.121
unhappy or thinking about that talk to him because 
he's reflecting on us you know we don't want any awl

32:05.654 --> 32:35.121
and we didn't have you know the first awls we had in 
europe we got replacement we had a bunch of

32:05.654 --> 32:35.121
characters two characters that came from the 
united states put down their barracks bag and took

32:05.654 --> 32:35.121
off took off for parents first awls we had in the in 
the unit and that was quite a few months actually

32:37.953 --> 32:39.715
And the trip was very good. We had a big ship for the 
battle group. I flew, or we flew, ahead, so we'd be

32:43.399 --> 32:49.225
there in Bremerhaven to meet them. The executive 
also had other people aboard the ship, so the trip

32:49.245 --> 32:55.612
was uneventful. Fogged in at Bremerhaven, which 
is not unusual in Germany. Where was the battle

33:00.958 --> 33:03.281
group stationed? Near Mannheim, Germany. And who 
is your superior?

33:11.764 --> 33:20.361
His headquarters is in

33:11.764 --> 33:20.361
Bad Cross Mountain. Let me see. I

33:20.922 --> 33:27.636
can't think of the name. During this, what—were 
you with the NATO forces, part of the NATO forces?

33:32.850 --> 33:33.210
Yeah. How'd you get along inside the NATO 
structure? Well, of course, we— Go out on

33:37.656 --> 33:40.320
maneuvers and stuff like that? Yeah.

33:43.845 --> 33:50.494
We were a battle group there near Mannheim, real 
near where we cross the Rhine when I tell you about

33:43.845 --> 33:50.494
patent-directing traffic. And out at Coleman 
Barracks, that's out of the suburb of Mannheim.

33:57.637 --> 34:16.882
When

33:57.637 --> 34:16.882
we first arrived there, we had to undergo a test to 
convince the Army commander, Corps commander,

33:57.637 --> 34:16.882
that we were combat ready. So we had that, as soon as 
we arrived, a three-day exercise, which we passed

34:19.345 --> 34:26.614
with a high mark. And this was the first really test 
we had because the test we ran ourselves back in

34:27.252 --> 34:37.348
Fort Riley was not a three-day test. It was about a 
day and a half. So the only time we had that was

34:39.852 --> 34:44.800
necessary to complete our cycle for the BL. But we 
did very well on that test. And then we trained, of

34:47.904 --> 34:49.267
course. We had training airs in the barge around 
the train. And then we would go to I met, I don't know

34:57.037 --> 35:04.384
his name here, Kaiselard, a big German, was a 
German, training here, and then he was a Frenchman

34:57.037 --> 35:04.384
now. Trained there as a unit. And then once a year 
you have a training test for three days. Every

35:12.551 --> 35:14.553
month you have unannounced alerts.

35:19.497 --> 35:26.824
And those are good tests because then you can 
measure how quickly that you can assemble a unit,

35:19.497 --> 35:26.824
get their equipment, and move out to a dispersal 
area out of the barracks. Sometime we would move

35:33.060 --> 35:43.492
there on to a training area, but most times you just 
acted as an all-air, and you reported the time it

35:33.060 --> 35:43.492
took you to close in. If you called off, you 
returned back and cleaned

35:44.213 --> 35:52.183
your equipment the rest of that year. One 
interesting side note, at least to me, I told you

35:55.036 --> 35:58.600
these outstanding people that they weren't all 
from California. I had from the University of

35:59.641 --> 36:01.443
Kentucky. I had one of their basketball stars. 
They didn't call him. And I forget his name, too. I

36:06.829 --> 36:07.589
can look it up. I got him. Clip him up there in the 
book up there.

36:15.017 --> 36:18.701
Real fine young man from California. I don't 
remember. I think he played on the junior college.

36:22.445 --> 36:24.267
We had five good basketball players. We won the 
first division champion at Fort Riley. Moved to

36:29.482 --> 36:32.886
Germany. We were in eighth division. And they had a 
delayed basketball season there because of the

36:35.108 --> 36:38.832
gyroscope. And we won the eighth division 
championship. You know, here in one year, they won

36:42.916 --> 36:47.081
two division championships. That's fantastic. 
That's really good. Had a little guy, real short.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.923
He was a Harlem grope-crawler type, you know. Boy, 
he could dribble. He was fast. He weeded way down

36:56.125 --> 36:57.908
through that. Finally get it to the tall 
University of Kentucky that he had an overhead

36:59.289 --> 37:04.956
loop shot. As he fade away, you know. How did the 
American troops get along with the German

37:11.644 --> 37:15.148
civilians? Oh, now at this time, sure. Excellent. 
My wife Mimi was president of the German-American

37:20.896 --> 37:27.062
Women's Club. And of course she was president of 
ours also in the 18th Infantry.

37:33.308 --> 37:37.552
So we met, well she met with them, of course, but we 
had parties together. They had plans, social

37:37.613 --> 37:47.622
functions, charity things, which all here are 
very active. It was excellent. The press was good

37:49.752 --> 37:51.234
to us. We got good press, the German papers and 
Mannheim. And the

37:55.980 --> 38:01.566
troops got along well in the community. And by that 
time, sometimes there was resentment against the

38:03.589 --> 38:07.694
blacks. But by that time, they had certain taverns 
which were receptive to blacks. And these were the

38:15.924 --> 38:19.168
ones that you had a mixed marriage would go to those 
because the resentment wasn't so much against the

38:19.756 --> 38:28.825
black as it was against that blonde German girl 
from there in the black. They took the view of one of

38:28.845 --> 38:33.290
them, a real fine sergeant. We had a boxer. That's 
another 18th Infantry. We had champion boxers. I

38:38.816 --> 38:42.880
inherited those, but I took those over with us. So 
we had champions

38:44.161 --> 38:48.666
in the division. But they fought the Germans, too. 
The Germans, of course, they had great boxers, you

38:53.561 --> 38:59.910
know, from the Shmelian days. Only bad thing about 
that, we had to wear the headband, you know, so we

38:59.930 --> 39:08.422
wouldn't have injuries. Of course, the Germans 
didn't. Some of the Germans didn't understand.

39:12.007 --> 39:14.491
But we always offered them. They should wear them 
since we were wearing them. But they'd usually

39:16.273 --> 39:18.096
say, no, we don't want to. but some of the German 
people thought that, you know, not only was he

39:18.987 --> 39:28.901
black and big and good as far as a bargain, he was 
equipped with these guys, but he was protected.

39:28.921 --> 39:37.413
So all of that, all the relationships in our battle 
group had the best record, disciplinary records.

39:37.433 --> 39:38.014
Did it, really? Yeah. How can you account for that? 
Well, because of these young men we had. They just

39:42.941 --> 39:44.863
hired tight. They weren't a cross-section of USA. 
It was a select group. And we had less demerits, I

39:50.071 --> 39:58.183
say disciplinary, no AWLs for a long time. We had 
less maintenance, deadline vehicles. And by all

40:02.208 --> 40:13.024
of the measurements, and we'd have our 
commander's conference, and the division

40:02.208 --> 40:13.024
headquarters always had all of these different 
disciplinary items on the wall. And we were always

40:16.782 --> 40:19.287
the lowest. The highest was the paratroopers. 
They had two battle groups, paratroopers. Of

40:25.859 --> 40:30.628
course, they always proving their manhood and 
their fighting and drinking. Sure. They had the

40:32.391 --> 40:33.132
worst. Do you think that Your success at this job 
and the fact that the group is so outstanding, do

40:34.992 --> 40:44.901
you think that was one of the major reasons for your 
rise to generalship? Yeah, because you have to be

40:44.921 --> 40:49.105
recommended. Sure. And so the division commander 
gave me a high-efficiency report and recommended

40:50.006 --> 40:58.735
me for General Lawson. And that's another one the 
board meets. If this individual had been

41:00.777 --> 41:03.379
recommended, by a number of general officers. And 
I don't mean by just a letter, because he wrote

41:08.197 --> 41:12.363
solicitors and said, would you write me a letter? 
You know, he served with them over a period of time.

41:15.849 --> 41:18.292
Well, then that has a weight. But my next 
assignment probably contributed more or as much

41:18.873 --> 41:24.983
as this one. And you stayed right in Germany then 
for the next two years. Yeah. Now, with the 7th

41:32.992 --> 41:37.959
United States Army Support Command in Europe, no. 
What exactly were you doing in this? See, that's in

41:41.844 --> 41:43.767
Mannheim also. I bet you're sorry to give up your 
own personal command. Oh, yeah. We even had our own

41:48.674 --> 41:57.206
theme song.

41:57.226 --> 42:00.771
And this was really popular with the Germans 
because the name of it was Happy Heiming. And it was

42:01.544 --> 42:04.627
a composite of two German folk songs. And the 18th 
Infantry had that for years, wasn't it? And we had

42:08.851 --> 42:14.477
our own band, unauthorized band, and our own honor 
guard, unauthorized. And how we did that, and I

42:14.497 --> 42:20.503
inherited this, so this is not my brilliant idea. 
It got us in trouble in Europe. One platoon of a

42:23.586 --> 42:27.450
unit.

42:28.628 --> 42:32.752
We put all of the honor guard in one platoon, but one 
platoon was the honor guard. And honor guard means

42:34.433 --> 42:41.539
we did all this drilling, you know, like the 
Marines do in Washington at the Marine. All the

42:42.380 --> 42:44.722
fancy rifle stuff. Plus, they really were honor 
guards. And on field exercises, they provided the

42:46.364 --> 42:52.389
security for the headquarters. Always, you've 
got to get it from somewhere, you know. These were

42:54.371 --> 42:55.151
trains. That's what you had to say. That's what 
impressed us when we first impressed the corps

42:58.261 --> 43:00.364
commander we got in Germany. He came down, he 
called it a war camp, an operation, whatever. And

43:06.012 --> 43:08.216
we had these two guys outside going. And boy, they 
snapped to attention. Of course, they could

43:11.140 --> 43:15.587
really make that rifle, you know, snap since they 
were training it. And he stopped and

43:16.508 --> 43:21.856
double-taped, started talking to them, how long 
you been to Army and all that sort of thing. Of

43:21.876 --> 43:23.659
course, they were just like everybody else. They 
just had the skill. And the band was another

43:27.337 --> 43:31.603
platoon of another unit. And we had our own 
instruments. And it was about a 12-piece band. It

43:36.810 --> 43:40.295
wasn't very large, but they could play music. But 
what was thrilling, even in the First Division,

43:40.315 --> 43:50.970
when the 18th Infantry would come, the band would 
stop whatever marks they were playing and play

43:40.315 --> 43:50.970
Happy Heine until we were all done. So anything 
that was 18th Infantry, that was a song.

43:57.593 --> 44:03.440
When we got to Europe, though, and these rifles, we 
had chrome rifles for the honor guard. The old 03,

44:05.602 --> 44:15.814
the old rifles, all chromed up, chrome domed.

44:17.256 --> 44:25.305
We'd gotten word that we weren't permitted to use 
those chrome rifles or couldn't use a band. It was

44:26.450 --> 44:27.491
unauthorized. So when we landed, automatically, 
the band came out in the honor guard with the colors

44:27.511 --> 44:39.382
off the ship first and lined up for everybody else. 
And they were playing not only Happy Heine, but

44:39.402 --> 44:46.248
other pieces.

44:46.268 --> 44:51.914
And the division commander came up to me and he 
said, you know, you're not supposed to have this. I

44:53.075 --> 44:54.516
said, I know it. morale building. Everybody likes 
it. He said, well, I tell you, I won't tell the Army

44:59.206 --> 45:05.675
Commander if you won't. So we just never did show 
those things when they were out. We still had our

45:08.879 --> 45:11.202
own parade battle groups. Every chance we got a 
happy honey, we'd go out

45:11.803 --> 45:17.751
and do it. So all those things would keep morale 
high. Yeah. That was top notch. I'm telling you.

45:25.201 --> 45:25.802
Just like a an athletic group that's really fired 
up, you know. And nearly all of them, I know all of

45:30.349 --> 45:35.377
them weren't that way, but the peer pressure kept a 
lot of them in line. Sure. You know, you jerks, if we

45:36.638 --> 45:40.024
go to do it this way, we get a long fine.

45:44.130 --> 45:52.883
So 7th Army Support Command was the Army support, 
just like Division Trains was in the 1st Division.

45:53.223 --> 45:55.587
This dealt with the entire 7th Army? That's right, 
support. So they're scattered and concerned all

45:57.090 --> 46:02.638
through Germany, just our headquarters in 
Mannheim. So that job, and I was chief of staff at

46:02.658 --> 46:21.507
the time, and my job, besides being the chief of 
staff duties, I conducted inspections for the

46:02.658 --> 46:21.507
commanding general on all these quartermaster, 
engineer, chemical, You just name it, all the

46:23.579 --> 46:25.342
facilities. So that got me out of the office, which 
I wanted to do. So I enjoyed that very much. Now, the

46:34.054 --> 46:36.378
commanding general then was General Shervin. And 
they put him there because he was an airborne

46:37.760 --> 46:40.764
general. He commanded the 101st. And General 
Bruce Clark wanted the support units to have the

46:41.946 --> 46:51.460
same standards that you have other ones. 
soldierly quality, that is, in addition to their

46:51.845 --> 46:56.451
technical ability. And Sherwin had done a good job 
in establishing this standard. And he asked for me

47:03.940 --> 47:09.387
to be chief of staff since we live right up the 
street from him. And I became his chief of staff.

47:12.671 --> 47:17.818
Moved across the street and that caused a big 
problem because
