00:03.878 --> 00:23.577
have you seen or have you noticed a difference in 
the role of women or the way women are treated

00:03.878 --> 00:23.577
between the north and the south?

00:26.500 --> 00:31.725
I think that in a sense you may be talking I really 
don't see the stereotype of the southern woman. I

00:36.134 --> 00:40.198
see people filling the stereotype, that's not 
what I mean. But I don't feel, I think the southern

00:41.940 --> 00:48.967
woman is just as strong as the northern woman. And I 
think she may role play a little bit more and

00:50.248 --> 00:59.738
may seem more feminine But there are lots of very 
feminine women in the North, too. I think you can

01:03.550 --> 01:09.737
build up stereotypes until really they're 
meaningless. But I went to school in the 50s in

01:09.817 --> 01:16.866
North Carolina. I knew a lot of Southern women. And 
most of them were hell on wheels. I mean, they were

01:24.895 --> 01:27.058
super intelligent. They were manipulative. Many 
of them were full of leading families. They knew

01:31.248 --> 01:33.412
how to juggle power. They could be feminine. I have 
a friend in Texas who is one of the most feminine

01:35.695 --> 01:41.485
women. If you spoke to her, you would say, this is 
the personification of the stereotype of the

01:41.545 --> 01:49.638
Southern woman. She is sweet. She is sugary. So on 
and so forth. And I want you to know this woman can

01:53.921 --> 02:00.347
manipulate legislators in the field of mental 
health. I mean, she can get people to do almost

02:00.367 --> 02:02.510
anything. And she's super smart. And she has a 
publication list as long as three arms.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.082
And when my daughter first met her, she really 
didn't like her. You see, because she took that

02:15.562 --> 02:17.404
stereotype. But when she got to know her, it was a 
different matter. And Dr. Merritt has been

02:21.173 --> 02:26.720
looking at ranch women. And you get some of that 
role playing there, but on the other hand, these

02:26.740 --> 02:32.687
women are just super. I mean, they fill men's 
roles, or they fill important roles. This

02:38.053 --> 02:41.577
business of a man's role versus a woman's role. I 
think some of these are stereotypes.

02:46.163 --> 02:49.527
There are in every society women and men who do not 
perform well. Men as well as women. And it depends

02:55.618 --> 02:59.863
on how you analyze this. It's just like women who 
say women do derogatory tasks and men do all the

02:59.923 --> 03:08.653
important things. A lot of nonsense. You sit down 
and you figure out how many derogatory tasks men do

03:15.123 --> 03:19.307
like carrying out garbage or so and so forth versus 
washing dishes. I mean, whatever it is, there are

03:19.327 --> 03:23.310
always problems. That kind of leads to my next 
question. Well, you know, some people feel that

03:26.052 --> 03:44.168
marriage is a form of servitude and, you know,

03:26.052 --> 03:44.168
why women accept men, their husband's name, and 
that when they get married, they tend to lose their

03:26.052 --> 03:44.168
identity. And, you know, how do you feel about 
this?

03:50.048 --> 03:52.672
I think housework is a form of servitude anyway. I 
mean, I don't enjoy housework. And, I mean, I don't

03:56.397 --> 03:58.881
think it's anything profitable. It's like going 
to search out bibliography using a car file and

03:58.941 --> 04:05.490
index when you can do it on the computer. You know, 
it's a waste of time. If there's an easier way of

04:07.673 --> 04:10.698
doing it, do it. There are certain things I like. I 
like to cook if I didn't gain weight. And I like to

04:14.827 --> 04:17.070
sew. I mean, just because it's different from what 
I do every day. So there are lots of things I like to

04:21.755 --> 04:25.319
do, but I think housework is drudgery. And unless 
it's something you like to do as a hobby or to do

04:26.981 --> 04:36.953
something different from your everyday work, 
everybody has to do it until we have robots or

04:37.827 --> 04:45.337
something that will do all these tasks, both male 
and female. I mean, if you're living in a house,

04:45.617 --> 04:54.989
somebody's got to keep it clean and somebody has to 
cook the meals unless you can afford to eat every

04:45.617 --> 04:54.989
meal out. Somebody's got to do it. And if it's a male 
living in a house, the male has to do it. If it's a

05:00.937 --> 05:07.125
female living in a house... Now, there are people 
who have had... who do not have a husband or a wife

05:07.628 --> 05:13.134
who will do these things. In other words, there are 
women who say, my husband will not lift a finger in

05:15.277 --> 05:18.540
the house. And I think that is very hard. I happen to 
have a husband who has always been willing to help.

05:26.249 --> 05:31.855
And if one of us has special work, then the other one 
tries to free the other one. And almost everybody

05:31.875 --> 05:35.880
that we knew who were in school with us did the same 
thing. And large numbers of working families

05:38.212 --> 05:44.499
share the work. But my father always did things. He 
didn't clean, but he would do the dishes. And in

05:54.751 --> 06:02.020
some ways, my mother is a really good cook, but in 
some ways there were things that my father could

05:54.751 --> 06:02.020
cook better. Not that he... that he rushed around 
doing it. But mother never had to carry out the

06:07.959 --> 06:10.823
garbage. She never had to do all the, never had to 
worry about house repair or any of those things. I

06:16.089 --> 06:19.554
mean, it was a sharing of responsibility. I think 
sometimes after a while you get awfully tired of

06:19.574 --> 06:24.720
some of these things and you think, well, I need 
help. But you really have to assess how much the

06:24.740 --> 06:27.263
other person does. I see. And did you feel that when 
you got married and accepted your husband's name,

06:34.484 --> 06:40.215
that you lost some of your identity or your being a 
separate person? No, but nobody was talking about

06:40.836 --> 06:43.741
that then. Maybe I would have if everybody had been 
talking about it. But what's in a name, really? And

06:52.217 --> 06:57.387
I know that younger faculty members feel 
differently about this. But what's so precious

06:57.907 --> 07:02.831
about your father's name versus your husband? I 
mean, in our society, names come down through the

07:02.851 --> 07:09.397
male line. In some societies, they come down 
through the female line. I'm not sure that this

07:13.360 --> 07:21.467
makes you a better person or makes you less of an 
individual. I mean, Margaret Mead would have been

07:22.248 --> 07:26.732
Margaret Mead whether she was a mead or whatever 
her maiden name was. I just don't think... I don't

07:33.454 --> 07:34.215
think the name... I think you can put too much 
emphasis on these things and not put emphasis on

07:34.235 --> 07:39.502
getting your work done. Do you feel that women 
today, and when you talk about the younger

07:40.944 --> 07:49.615
faculty, do you think that they put too much into 
these things?

07:56.378 --> 07:58.941
I think there's a little bit too much... I don't 
think you can interpret everything that happens

08:00.062 --> 08:06.709
to you as being male-female. And I think when you do 
this, you're mishearing everything else that

08:06.730 --> 08:12.956
happens. And you're always looking for someone 
who is discriminating against you. And I just

08:19.704 --> 08:25.170
think it's a waste of time. But I have,

08:25.910 --> 08:54.837
if I had been discriminated against seriously, I 
mean in an area that was especially important to

08:25.910 --> 08:54.837
me, if I had had work limitations or had felt that 
the resources in a particular department was such

08:25.910 --> 08:54.837
that I was not getting my share, maybe I would feel 
the same way.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.401
You've got to look at the way a lot of men feel, too. 
Because you can be in a department with all men, and

09:01.382 --> 09:14.954
half the men can feel that a department head or a 
corporate head is

09:01.382 --> 09:14.954
discriminating against them. And what reason do 
you give? Because they're male? I mean, there are

09:19.418 --> 09:27.085
people, if you have an all-male division, there 
are going to be people who feel that they're being

09:19.418 --> 09:27.085
discriminated against. What's the basis of that 
discrimination? Talent? Ability to sell

09:32.449 --> 09:34.752
yourself?

09:37.676 --> 09:52.614
I

09:37.676 --> 09:52.614
believe in equality,

09:37.676 --> 09:52.614
but I think there are better ways of fighting for it 
than to keep dwelling on it. For example, I'm not

09:53.175 --> 09:57.240
sure how important women's studies are.

10:03.071 --> 10:05.816
I don't think any area ought to be neglected. But I 
really feel in education at this point in time, you

10:06.597 --> 10:14.510
ought to be educating people for jobs. How do you 
educate people for jobs? What are they going to do

10:17.875 --> 10:21.962
if they have a whole bunch of courses in women's 
studies? Is everybody going to teach women's

10:22.904 --> 10:26.308
studies? Or is everybody going into an agency that 
is going to guarantee civil rights of females?

10:35.518 --> 10:37.580
I mean, what are you going to do with women's 
studies?

10:41.184 --> 10:42.585
That's a good point. Yeah, I mean, I can understand 
that if I were teaching a course in... that fit into

10:49.212 --> 10:54.960
that category that I might want to fight for just 
because I might want to teach a course in that area.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.985
But I think the bottom line is, what can you do with 
it? Is it going to get you a job, meat on the table,

10:58.886 --> 11:05.396
new clothes, a house? And I don't see it as being a 
profitable area.

11:12.907 --> 11:16.312
Well, Dr. Shepherd, those are all the questions 
that I have for you. Is there anything that you

11:16.392 --> 11:18.375
would like to add?

11:21.781 --> 11:38.473
How

11:21.781 --> 11:38.473
do you feel about

11:21.781 --> 11:38.473
some of the things you've heard? Well, I'm still 
trying to assess it all. It's been very

11:41.845 --> 11:47.892
interesting to get a different point of view after 
interviewing Dr. Sell and you. And I'm going to go

11:47.932 --> 11:50.576
on and try to interview Dr. Merritt. And I think 
that will be just another person's point of view.

11:55.181 --> 12:02.551
And I'm interested in this because I'm looking at a 
career in academia, in research, and being a

11:55.181 --> 12:02.551
professor. And so I'm just kind of taking it all in, 
trying to make my own decisions. Well, I think it's

12:08.525 --> 12:12.690
one of the easier fields for women to be in. I

12:12.710 --> 12:26.348
think that

12:12.710 --> 12:26.348
if and when you marry, it's always helpful to marry 
somebody who is understanding. But there are

12:27.389 --> 12:36.000
always, it doesn't matter whether you're married 
or you have a roommate or whatever the situation

12:27.389 --> 12:36.000
is, If work demands a major proportion of your time 
and you're not able to juggle things so that you're

12:36.858 --> 12:55.320
not assuming responsibilities in the private 
sector of your life, there are always conflicts.

12:56.501 --> 12:58.984
In other words, if you have a roommate and you don't 
keep your your room clean or you don't do your share

13:00.044 --> 13:07.712
of the work, there's going to be conflict. So 
there's going to be conflict anywhere. Living

13:09.894 --> 13:17.542
together with people means that there's got to be a 
give and take. And why one would expect that there

13:17.562 --> 13:24.729
wouldn't be, I don't know. But it almost, some 
of... of the expressed attitudes make it appear

13:28.934 --> 13:36.525
that women have the hardest row and men don't. And I 
guess over the years, certainly since the

13:37.166 --> 13:56.713
development of the overt women's movement, a lot 
of young men, students at the university, have

13:37.166 --> 13:56.713
come to me and they have they have raised questions 
about how they can handle their personal life.

14:03.909 --> 14:17.008
They have met this girl and they really like her and 
she wants to have a career and if they had their way

14:03.909 --> 14:17.008
that would be okay up until the time they have 
children. But you know that The woman doesn't feel

14:21.888 --> 14:23.410
that way. How do you handle this and not lose the 
girl? I mean, essentially some of the same things

14:26.534 --> 14:29.898
that women are feeling. You know, how much do you 
really tell someone you're thinking of marrying

14:30.438 --> 14:36.065
about the way you really feel? And

14:36.105 --> 14:51.203
I guess, you know, the off-the-cuff answer is it's 
better to at least explain how you feel and talk

14:36.105 --> 14:51.203
about how you can work it out. rather than 
role-playing and then getting into marriage and

14:51.503 --> 15:01.595
suddenly finding that you were married to this 
person who has very different views. If you had

15:01.675 --> 15:09.765
discussed them and worked out some arrangement 
before marriage, it would be a lot easier. But it's

15:10.386 --> 15:11.066
hard. In any courtship situation, there's a lot of 
role-playing. And it's hard to get by that.

15:26.361 --> 15:47.700
A

15:26.361 --> 15:47.700
few years ago, when we began to get a lot of change, 
young people as well as old people living

15:26.361 --> 15:47.700
together, unmarried, and stuff like that, I had a 
secretary who worked for me on a research project.

15:49.402 --> 15:51.124
And she was very outspoken. Her husband was 
getting a doctorate in something like tree

15:51.144 --> 15:56.591
genetics. And she had a little boy. And a lot of the 
graduate students used to flock around her. She

16:03.740 --> 16:08.225
was quite an interesting person and very, very 
talented. I mean, she was way overqualified for

16:08.245 --> 16:12.430
secretary, so it was great for me. And they would 
talk about some boy they were living with. in town.

16:21.832 --> 16:23.294
And she would say, you're all crazy. She says, 
you're living with this person and you're doing

16:23.675 --> 16:31.549
his laundry and you're doing all these things and 
you're sitting around hoping that he'll marry

16:23.675 --> 16:31.549
you. And she says, you don't get any of the perks 
that you get when you're courting. Because he

16:37.899 --> 16:39.422
never takes you out or take you out very seldom, 
never spends any money on you, no gifts. And she was

16:45.679 --> 16:47.461
really quite interesting. And I had a graduate 
student who very romantically met this boy in

16:47.542 --> 17:02.625
December, just before the, oh,

16:47.542 --> 17:02.625
I would say maybe three weeks from now. And her car 
broke down, and he lived in her apartment area.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.734
She'd never met him, and he helped her fix it. And so 
she invited him to dinner. And then they saw each

17:14.368 --> 17:28.061
other every day for about three weeks before he 
went out into, he was in banking, or he was going to

17:14.368 --> 17:28.061
be in banking. And he had to serve an 
apprenticeship for a semester in his graduate

17:28.081 --> 17:33.606
program. So he went out to California to do this, 
and she was madly in love with him. And so he asked

17:40.287 --> 17:47.556
her to come and live with him for a month to see 
whether they could get along. And so our secretary

17:48.457 --> 17:54.084
said, oh, you know, that's a lot of nonsense, you 
know, and so on and so forth. And, uh, principally

17:55.306 --> 17:59.631
because she was afraid the girl would have her 
heart broken, you know. And so she asked me what I

18:00.372 --> 18:04.557
thought, and, uh, and I said, well, I didn't think 
It was such a hot idea. But she went anyway. And she

18:09.913 --> 18:13.296
went out there for three weeks. She was working on 
her thesis at the time. She went out there for three

18:16.079 --> 18:17.080
weeks. She came back with a diamond the size of a 
cantaloupe. Oh, my goodness. And she had this big

18:22.245 --> 18:23.586
wedding. I mean, and she's very happily married 
and has two children now. So, you know, that was the

18:30.232 --> 18:33.015
last time I opened my mouth. But they don't all 
happen like that. Because a lot of them happen like

18:36.329 --> 18:44.397
the secretary said, that the girl is hoping the 
boy's going to marry her, and nothing happens. Or

18:44.958 --> 18:49.963
the boy is hoping the girl will marry him, and she 
doesn't. So interpersonal relationships are

18:49.983 --> 18:55.229
very difficult. And they are complicated by 
changes, and not knowing how to change them, and

18:55.249 --> 19:03.618
not knowing how to communicate feelings. Not to 
communicate them with this. It's either going to

19:06.046 --> 19:08.008
be this way or not at all. But to communicate them 
with, I care for you. How can we work this out? That

19:14.736 --> 19:20.442
kind, a more reasonable approach.

19:20.843 --> 19:24.767
And I think we'll have problems for a while. But I 
don't see any way in our society that females

19:24.787 --> 19:34.618
will be removed from the workforce unless large 
numbers of jobs are removed. In fact, there may be

19:42.496 --> 19:57.639
more females in the workforce than males if 
females are more technically oriented, more into

19:42.496 --> 19:57.639
the kinds of jobs that are going to be available in 
the next several years. I mean, you look at the

19:58.680 --> 20:01.905
number of students in business And I think they're 
over the 50% mark now in female. That's

20:06.605 --> 20:09.209
interesting. At least, someone told me that. I 
don't remember whether it was Dawn Wood who told me

20:11.111 --> 20:14.556
that or not. Somebody told me quite recently. 
Well, I'll have to look into it and find out those

20:17.840 --> 20:20.905
statistics. That would be very interesting. But 
you see, in those fields, and the number of women

20:22.467 --> 20:27.133
engineers is increasing.

20:30.472 --> 20:32.388
Well, thank you for your time. You are very 
welcome.
