00:05.870 --> 00:19.490
The black colleges in the South, of course, were 
originally started by northern missionaries

00:05.870 --> 00:19.490
who, I suppose, they've gotten all the labels. 
They were the nigger lovers. They were the persons

00:22.815 --> 00:29.464
who believed that black people had this equal 
opportunity to fight after the Civil War. And they

00:29.484 --> 00:34.932
were hoping that the establishment of colleges 
would help. liberate blacks from the problems

00:35.620 --> 00:42.869
that they had. And so, of course, the funding for 
many of them came from northern churches, and even

00:43.110 --> 00:51.961
to this day. And then, of course, the Negro College 
Fund eventually was formulated much later. And,

00:57.729 --> 01:03.957
of course, the southern churches because of 
various ways, have not been real strong

01:05.185 --> 01:15.078
supporters, although I'd have to, I really can't 
speak intelligently on percentages here. But, of

01:16.100 --> 01:32.762
course, there was a tendency that once they did get 
started, that the white, predominantly white,

01:16.100 --> 01:32.762
denominational churches did give help to the 
black college as much as they would give

01:16.100 --> 01:32.762
missionary aid to sending people to Africa. same 
kind of mentality. Minnesota Conference, which I

01:37.310 --> 01:42.176
was a part, really tried to raise a lot of money for 
West College. That's why I was involved with it to

01:42.196 --> 01:46.042
some degree. And the pastor of the church where I 
was serving as a campus minister was on the board of

01:46.823 --> 01:51.950
trustees. There were all these kinds of tie-ins 
with that, but I saw that kind of mentality of

01:51.970 --> 01:58.258
giving. Again, because there was a feeling on the 
part of the people in the northern churches that we

02:03.455 --> 02:12.986
ought to do something about our country, you know, 
in the South. And I think that was a worthy and noble

02:14.207 --> 02:17.451
goal. And even to this day, there's a need for black 
colleges, I believe, as well as women's colleges,

02:18.693 --> 02:32.128
as well as other kinds of ethnic colleges, because 
there's certain, according to research, as I

02:32.632 --> 02:43.106
understand it, there's certain self-esteem that 
is built into people when you have role models of

02:32.632 --> 02:43.106
people that are like you. And I think that's worthy 
in facing the problems of life that you can see

02:43.126 --> 02:57.065
people who are like you succeeding and not feeling 
the failures that are around when you don't have

02:43.126 --> 02:57.065
those role models. Well, considering that 
support from the North added the Well, of course,

03:02.635 --> 03:19.757
they were ridiculously bad, because here, even 
though the college was formed after the Civil War,

03:02.635 --> 03:19.757
here we were in 1963. And, of course, the Civil War 
was over in 1965, 1865.

03:26.866 --> 03:32.473
And so, here the college was almost 100 years old, 
and it still wasn't accredited. it was the last

03:33.668 --> 04:00.165
black college of our church that was accredited 
eventually it is now accredited and of course i

03:33.668 --> 04:00.165
heard a story recently about i was talking to an 
accrediting head of the southern association as a

03:33.668 --> 04:00.165
matter of fact because i was on one of these 
committees here in texas and he pointed out how you

03:33.668 --> 04:00.165
know people can get accreditation if they have a 
lot of money in some from New York came down to

04:01.377 --> 04:08.745
Florida and got this thing accredited in a very 
short time because they were millions, both

04:01.377 --> 04:08.745
millions. Well, the church just didn't put enough 
money into that college to get it accredited, and

04:08.825 --> 04:19.317
so an unaccredited college does not attract a lot 
of students. And so that was a very big problem, and

04:19.337 --> 04:27.486
fortunately that has now been overcome. I don't 
know if I fully answered your question, but it

04:29.677 --> 04:46.252
shows that finances of the church were not given to 
meet some of these ethnic and minority concerns.

04:46.332 --> 04:53.279
Now, the Methodist Church for the last two 
quadrenniums has put the ethnic church as number

04:46.332 --> 04:53.279
one. So now, there is a real emphasis in giving 
towards these concerns more than any other

04:58.448 --> 05:01.051
concerns. So again, Methodist Church is a 
national and international leader in this very

05:01.071 --> 05:21.115
thing and I'm glad to know that I belong to a church 
that is trying to practice in all its policies a

05:01.071 --> 05:21.115
more equalitarian than any other denomination or 
church that I know in the world today. The ethnic

05:26.665 --> 05:36.237
church in the United States or in the world, the 
missions field, is where the most money is going

05:26.665 --> 05:36.237
right now? Oh, the Methodist Church is always all 
denominations. They put more money into their

05:41.164 --> 05:46.510
local church than they ever give to missions. And 
domestic missions are their own missions. That's

05:50.862 --> 05:56.834
a natural phenomenon.

05:57.295 --> 06:01.865
Did you ever get to meet the professor that you 
exchanged with? Yes, I met him. We visited

06:02.987 --> 06:05.091
briefly. What was his reaction to his experience?

06:11.703 --> 06:21.798
A lot of problems existed in the Mankato area 
because he was a black person, he was perceived as a

06:11.703 --> 06:21.798
black person because he isn't learning. Just to 
give you an example, a very strange thing

06:24.082 --> 06:28.448
happened. We had a heating system problem in our 
house and the heating system would go bang because

06:28.468 --> 06:40.326
of various times he couldn't uniformly get around 
the pipes and he was scared to death a number of

06:40.829 --> 07:08.929
times he thought somebody had bombed the building 
and of course that was partly due to the fact that

06:40.829 --> 07:08.929
that was actually happening in Birmingham there 
was this terrible bombing and we had racists in

06:40.829 --> 07:08.929
Mankato I was I wasn't threatened but I was called 
even by some of the people in our congregation, in

07:09.466 --> 07:25.525
various derogatory terms, because of my interest 
in helping in

07:09.466 --> 07:25.525
this equality work that we were working on. So did 
he give any advice to you all upon returning of

07:28.088 --> 07:37.279
things that could be done in your cave in a previous 
situation? He wasn't one to give advice on that,

07:38.660 --> 07:45.528
and I wasn't one to give advice to him either. We 
both were humbled by the experience of living in a

07:45.909 --> 07:57.863
way in two different cultures, and yet here we were 
citizens of the same country. When did, upon

07:57.883 --> 08:08.616
returning home, was that when you first started to 
hear about the March on Washington, or was that

07:57.883 --> 08:08.616
when the works were while in Illinois? Well, of 
course, it was the same year that I was in that

08:08.984 --> 08:14.312
exchange in the spring. And then, of course, I was 
active in student work. So I think the march in

08:21.502 --> 08:31.637
Washington was just a culmination of our 
expression of frustration over the whole

08:21.502 --> 08:31.637
situation. I mean, people generally don't march 
unless there's a lot of frustration going on in

08:31.778 --> 08:37.506
their hearts and minds. So this is just a 
culmination of hundreds of years of frustration

08:38.380 --> 08:46.772
that we were expressing. Frustration in our own 
religion that was not practicing what it

08:46.973 --> 08:51.620
preached. Frustration in the democracy that was 
not practicing what it preached. Frustration in

08:55.385 --> 09:07.543
the educational system that was

08:55.385 --> 09:07.543
saying certain things in the textbooks, but not 
really living it out. in educational

09:08.468 --> 09:11.592
institutions, and on and on and on. Just total 
frustration

09:11.672 --> 09:20.523
with the words of democracy and the lack of 
practice.

09:23.447 --> 09:32.598
So what were your steps to go to UN as a delegate for 
the Methodist Church for the Minnesota

09:23.447 --> 09:32.598
Conference? Well, these things happened really 
quickly. March

09:37.342 --> 09:59.271
on Washington was being organized and there was 
going to be all this happening and some of us were

09:37.342 --> 09:59.271
interested in participating in it and so 
different kinds of things happened. At Mankato

10:00.793 --> 10:04.598
State different groups were praying about it, 
working on it, and decided that certain people

10:05.084 --> 10:31.817
ought to be sent as delegates, and then I was a part 
of a regional system of the Methodist Church, and I

10:05.084 --> 10:31.817
was one of the associate deans of the summer camp 
program that met every year, and they also felt we

10:05.084 --> 10:31.817
ought to be a part of this, and so there were 
different organizations in the church, both in

10:33.350 --> 10:40.317
the local, regional, and national level. And then 
there were some of us that volunteered to be a part

10:41.958 --> 10:47.223
of this representative process. So that's how it 
happened. So in going to the march, you felt like

10:50.787 --> 11:01.197
the main purpose was a mass expression of 
frustration about the institution you were in?

11:01.953 --> 11:29.800
frustration about the political, religious, and 
educational, and economic institutions of our

11:01.953 --> 11:29.800
country, that we're not living up to the ideals 
that were written down as practices and policies

11:01.953 --> 11:29.800
to follow in dealing with people who are of 
different races and colors and creeds. What do you

11:31.619 --> 11:51.182
feel was the response from, as an attempt to lobby 
for Kennedy's moderate civil rights package, and

11:31.619 --> 11:51.182
to Martin Luther King said he felt like the march 
was a subpoena on the conscience of the United

11:31.619 --> 11:51.182
States. What was your response after that day? 
Well, I think it was the greatest step forward in

11:56.148 --> 11:59.972
American democracy. even greater than the 
American Revolution or the Civil War in terms of a

12:00.931 --> 12:30.145
positive kind of witness that made us world 
leaders, I believe, and still world leaders in

12:00.931 --> 12:30.145
trying to practice some of these things that we 
have in our Bible and in the US Constitution. Which

12:30.901 --> 12:33.143
speaker affected you the most?

12:35.966 --> 12:45.357
Well, of course, you know, I could say it was Martin 
Luther King and his great dramatic

12:35.966 --> 12:45.357
speech. I had a dream there at the memorial, but I'm 
not sure that that was... I think the greatest

12:56.045 --> 13:05.278
speaker was the Spirit of God working in the midst 
of our humanity. The voice of God, the voice of

13:05.298 --> 13:16.894
human conscience over

13:05.298 --> 13:16.894
all of history,

13:05.298 --> 13:16.894
human history. And these were the voices that I 
heard. I think the voice of Christ Of course,

13:25.205 --> 13:45.736
Martin Luther King would quote Christ, and so I saw 
a, and as far as that goes, it was the voices, you

13:25.205 --> 13:45.736
know, universally around the world.

13:45.756 --> 13:52.967
One of the speakers at that day was from the Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. called

13:53.150 --> 13:55.193
SNCC. They came out of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference with Martin Luther King

13:56.134 --> 14:05.448
started, and he was a rather militant speaker. Do 
you remember that? Like you said, Louis? Well, I

14:09.333 --> 14:14.020
remember hearing of him, knowing of him. I never 
knew him personally, and I, um, disagreed with a

14:19.137 --> 14:31.794
number of the people who

14:19.137 --> 14:31.794
ideologically nor practically did I agree with. 
Some people felt that although Martin Luther King

14:31.814 --> 14:45.892
preached nonviolence, that in effect his 
preaching of nonviolence was actually inciting

14:31.814 --> 14:45.892
violence. How do you feel about that? Well, the 
same criticism was made of Jesus and Gandhi and

14:47.251 --> 14:54.421
others. You remember Jesus, Gandhi, and others 
did not have a political army, you know. And what

15:02.453 --> 15:07.460
are the alternatives if you don't have an army and 
computers and missiles? What are your

15:08.181 --> 15:09.923
alternatives to power? About all you have is the 
people and mass, or a person as an individual. But

15:18.301 --> 15:41.662
do

15:18.301 --> 15:41.662
you think that the changes that were accomplished 
during that period could have been

15:18.301 --> 15:41.662
done without the violence and things that did take 
place, without the change in the South, the

15:18.301 --> 15:41.662
antagonistic attitude towards the South? Well, 
you have to measure violence. Look, when we had war

15:43.143 --> 15:47.447
with England, And we separated from them, and that 
was, we had a lot of people die. But it was a small

15:53.763 --> 16:00.133
number compared to what died in the Civil War, the 
largest number in the history of the country. And

16:00.153 --> 16:10.268
neither the issues of the Revolutionary War or the 
Civil War were settled in any form or fashion,

16:00.153 --> 16:10.268
really. Whereas this did help settle some of the 
issues that they aren't. fully worked out, but at

16:18.325 --> 16:37.932
least we do have some semblance of American 
democracy being practiced on all levels of our

16:18.325 --> 16:37.932
society now in 1985, whereas we didn't have that in 
1865 or in 1776. We had these paper promises. Now I

16:41.997 --> 16:46.864
think we're beyond paper promises and we do some 
practical realism. Nothing's accomplished in

16:47.941 --> 17:10.686
this world, unfortunately, save through war or 
political protest or Pearl Harbor type

16:47.941 --> 17:10.686
experiences because of the idiotic behavior of 
people. Concrete thinking, people have their

17:12.428 --> 17:16.412
minds set in concrete. And no matter, you know, 
presently I'm engaged in this suicide youth,

17:17.354 --> 17:39.374
teenage situation, but it doesn't affect anybody 
until a Pearl Harbor happens in a family or a

17:17.354 --> 17:39.374
community, and then you can start working. And I 
can't tell you why. I mean, I'm working, and it

17:42.217 --> 17:45.960
hasn't happened here, but there's a a small 
minority of us that work on these problems of

17:46.396 --> 18:09.700
society, whether it be war, suicide, civil 
rights, poverty, feeding the hungry, saving the

17:46.396 --> 18:09.700
environment, we've got terrible problems with 
acid rain in the environment now, and those are

17:46.396 --> 18:09.700
just some of my concerns, and we're just a small 
number. And we're all human, we get tired, we don't

18:10.361 --> 18:15.306
have money, but Sometimes we have to use large

18:15.978 --> 18:22.744
crowds. Sometimes we have to use the mass media. 
Sometimes we have to use protest letters to make

18:27.628 --> 18:33.334
it. Well, I guess what I'm referring to is 
something like the Selma March, where the

18:34.755 --> 18:43.243
marchers tried to cross that bridge for days. 
There were two people killed, two white was

18:47.028 --> 18:52.473
something like that really necessary? And I get to 
see some, what some Southerners think is that if

18:53.494 --> 19:10.351
the civil rights movement had taken place in the 
sense that it did with the sit-ins and all, that

18:53.494 --> 19:10.351
today, socially, there'd be a better situation 
between whites and blacks. And one comment that

19:10.371 --> 19:15.516
was made is that a lot of the legislative progress 
that was made during the 50s and the 60s is now being

19:15.884 --> 19:24.654
overturned in the 80s. For instance, with what is 
that thing in Texas that came up about the tuition?

19:29.519 --> 19:36.026
Being able to take your tuition to anywhere that 
you go, want to go to school.

19:38.949 --> 19:44.035
That seems to me like a recall of that to what 
Virginia was trying to do. Well, I think that all

19:45.500 --> 19:50.745
these things are ups and downs. You move one inch 
ahead and you retreat one mile behind in human

19:51.105 --> 20:00.553
rights and civil rights. And that's the way of 
humanity. As long as we have humans, there's going

20:05.457 --> 20:11.042
to be that reaction phenomena. So I can't answer it 
except to say yes, I think. There are some things

20:15.267 --> 20:26.585
that are, in some parts of the country, maybe not as 
favorable as they ought to be or they should be. But

20:27.486 --> 20:42.270
overall, comparing 1963 with 1985, I see many more 
favorable things now than then.

20:43.837 --> 20:45.560
That's the only way I can answer it. You know, with 
specific situations, you can always find things

20:45.620 --> 20:53.733
that are different.

20:56.998 --> 21:04.530
I guess one thing about Martin Luther King, that 
was the second time that you heard him speak. When

21:04.670 --> 21:08.376
was the first time? Yeah, second time in person, 
but of course I heard him continually during that

21:08.947 --> 21:19.484
era on television, the radio, and so forth. But the 
first time we had invited him to come to be our

21:19.584 --> 21:36.270
Wesley Foundation speaker, and of course he was 
with us for a number of days, and I got to know him in

21:19.584 --> 21:36.270
the context of better than, you know, often you get 
to know most people, which, you know, you hear them

21:38.545 --> 21:48.958
at a rally, or a speech, and that's it. What were 
your impressions? I felt that he was a sincere

21:51.081 --> 21:59.292
person who was attempting to live out the 
convictions of his life. His father was a pastor in

21:59.372 --> 22:05.059
Atlanta, and he definitely, I thought, was trying 
to bring to our consciousness the fact that our

22:05.680 --> 22:22.903
Christianity was not doing what the New Testament 
had indicated that it should be doing in this time

22:05.680 --> 22:22.903
in history. And I think that he was doing what a 
preacher ought to be doing who was convicted to

22:24.084 --> 22:35.299
bring both personal and social justice to us and of 
course I saw in him the prophetic voices of Amos and

22:35.819 --> 23:04.341
Hosea and others in the Old Testament who tried to 
help the Jewish people long before Christ to be

22:35.819 --> 23:04.341
more compassionate to each other as well as their 
neighbors and bring justice and understanding to

23:04.979 --> 23:10.686
the people that were living in those BC times. What 
was the response of the community to his presence?

23:15.912 --> 23:32.050
Well, the Mankato community in general were 
impressed with his oratory and his sincerity and

23:15.912 --> 23:32.050
the fact that he was trying to, as a person, unright 
the wrongs of humanity throughout history.

23:32.992 --> 23:35.795
through his movement, Southern Leadership 
Travellers.

23:39.740 --> 23:44.445
He was brought by Wilbur Gross, is that right? 
Well, he was brought by a number of us who felt he was

23:44.465 --> 23:57.841
a local witness to some of the convictions that we 
believe are inherent in the Old and New Testament.

23:57.941 --> 24:00.764
Did his wife come along with him? No, he didn't.

24:05.442 --> 24:16.177
Would you like to make any general conclusions or 
further comments about that period of time? Well,

24:16.197 --> 24:34.943
I would say that I was glad that I lived through that 
era of time because it helped me understand how

24:16.197 --> 24:34.943
important it is as a person who has been given many 
good things, such as a religious heritage that

24:16.197 --> 24:34.943
sees a uniformity and equality inherent in our 
faith and also I'm thankful for our political

24:35.851 --> 25:02.128
heritage and the fact that we have a constitution 
that says idealistically what we ought to be and

24:35.851 --> 25:02.128
I'm thankful also for having an educational 
opportunity in this country to have had

25:03.290 --> 25:12.443
professors and fellow students who helped me 
understand the importance of all of these things.

25:13.765 --> 25:32.672
I think that era of history is one that

25:13.765 --> 25:32.672
really, as I said, did more than the

25:13.765 --> 25:32.672
Revolutionary War or the Civil War to help 
humanity see that we need to focus in on the values

25:33.209 --> 25:47.728
of human beings, that all human beings have worth 
in terms of their life. And out of that came an

25:48.869 --> 25:58.542
appreciation, not just for blacks, but for browns 
and yellows

26:03.787 --> 26:08.331
reds and all the other rainbows of humanity. I 
think that also that period of history helped us

26:09.773 --> 26:32.275
see how

26:09.773 --> 26:32.275
utterly difficult it is always to change our legal 
system and our institutions and even our families

26:32.828 --> 26:37.853
to appreciate people who are different than we 
are. And I think that it's helped me individually

26:39.395 --> 26:57.515
to try to bridge the gaps and the barriers that are 
ever around us in trying to relate to people,

26:39.395 --> 26:57.515
listen to people, understand people. I 
personally believe that most important thing

27:01.195 --> 27:24.486
that we can do as a country and as members of the 
human race is to gain these kinds of

27:01.195 --> 27:24.486
understandings and to try to live them out so that 
we can avoid human prejudice and conflict,

27:01.195 --> 27:24.486
violence and war. I think that this is something 
that goes beyond Any ideology or religion, it

27:31.182 --> 27:42.552
should universally be in our veins to do that. 
Unfortunately, it isn't that way genetically, so

27:43.313 --> 27:58.287
we have to work in a sociological way through the 
institutions of politics, religion, the family,

27:43.313 --> 27:58.287
in the socialization of of people, and I think it 
differentiates us from the animals when we do

27:59.043 --> 28:03.589
that. When we don't do it, I think we are back to 
stark jungle. In fact, the jungle, and I've lived

28:09.938 --> 28:17.989
in the jungle, is actually better than the jungle 
we create with our prejudice.

28:21.093 --> 28:25.759
The raw jungle is a safer environment, more safe 
environment, I find, than the jungle that we have

28:26.785 --> 28:31.451
created by our prejudices.

28:36.278 --> 28:39.722
Here is a quote I found. I guess it was about that 
violence that I was trying to play here. I was

28:45.110 --> 28:48.554
trying to talk about something that Martin Luther 
King said. He said, I've almost reached the

28:49.235 --> 28:55.003
regrettable conclusion that the Negro's 
greatest stumbling block in the stride towards

28:49.235 --> 28:55.003
freedom is not the white citizens' council or the 
Ku Klux Klan, but the white moderate who is more

28:55.709 --> 29:03.722
devoted to order than to justice. That's what I was 
trying to say. I guess that was one thing I was

29:07.568 --> 29:11.434
reading about this Ku Klux Klan. Well, I think, you 
know, that it's,

29:11.454 --> 29:21.970
that's an interesting problem, because later on, 
when I started to work with blacks, on various

29:22.591 --> 29:23.893
projects. I was rejected because I was seen as a 
paternalistic white who was cultivating their

29:23.993 --> 29:36.550
interest in it. Now, since the law gave them 
equality again, of course in the law, but we

29:36.570 --> 29:47.164
weren't enforcing it, that I was interfering with 
their understanding. They didn't need any white

29:50.139 --> 29:52.682
leadership anymore. They could carry it 
themselves. And all I've got to say for the poor

29:55.806 --> 30:12.407
black, or for the person that has that mentality, 
and I speak right to Martin Luther King here,

29:55.806 --> 30:12.407
there's no man, Martin Luther King or anybody 
else, that I wouldn't challenge. I'm a thinking

30:12.547 --> 30:16.712
person too. and I would challenge Martin Luther 
King to say that we can't really get along without

30:17.165 --> 30:26.980
each other. I don't think he'd disagree with that. 
But that we really haven't got time to blame

30:29.324 --> 30:36.896
different kinds of people either. I think he said 
some of that, probably some of the bitterness that

30:38.759 --> 30:43.206
he experienced And again, not being treated 
probably equally. There were some liberal whites

30:47.560 --> 31:00.695
who got into the southern Christian leadership 
movement and assumed

30:47.560 --> 31:00.695
leadership and took it away from some of the 
blacks. And I think that's what he was, he probably

31:01.015 --> 31:09.245
was striking back at that and he probably resented 
that to some degree. I don't know. He's dead. It'd

31:10.887 --> 31:12.028
be interesting to to talk with him if he were here 
about that. But I think it's probably some of his

31:17.138 --> 31:34.919
own feelings and resentment that even in this 
movement, there were some whites who put order,

31:17.138 --> 31:34.919
peace, somewhat like the problem of...

31:36.721 --> 31:40.986
Sometimes it's just like in all of life, you've got 
to go through a conflict before you can get to the

31:41.253 --> 31:45.639
other side sometimes. And sometimes we, yeah, we 
would rather not talk to each other, we'd rather

31:45.659 --> 32:08.813
not confront one another, we'd rather not say one 
another, to one another, the things we ought to say

31:45.659 --> 32:08.813
because we think we might hurt each other, and yet 
if we remain silent and we don't say it, ultimately

31:45.659 --> 32:08.813
in the long run we'll be guilty of

31:45.659 --> 32:08.813
problems. And I think I've made those mistakes 
too, and I continue to make those mistakes. And

32:17.026 --> 32:21.892
there are some people who are not close friends of 
mine because I do speak my mind to them. And

32:22.092 --> 32:32.605
sometimes it was in case and in times of trying to 
help save their life, be it from drugs or whatever,

32:22.092 --> 32:32.605
that I said what I said. And I'm sorry, I thought 
more of their life than I did of our friendship. And

32:41.817 --> 32:59.057
that may be also true of some of the people who are my 
relatives and friends who I've spoken directly

32:41.817 --> 32:59.057
to, not in anger, but just, you don't have to say it 
in anger, it just still can be misunderstood, you

32:41.817 --> 32:59.057
know. And I said it because of their health and 
their life more than it was interesting. If I hurt

33:04.863 --> 33:08.888
them because I said it, I said it. I regret that I 
hurt them, but I don't regret that I said

33:11.791 --> 33:19.403
it. Well, thank you very much, Dad. Thank you for 
your good questions. They were hard.
