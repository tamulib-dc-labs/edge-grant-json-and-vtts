WEBVTT

00:04.925 --> 00:08.389
Well, was this steam engine that was pulling 
the... I'm pretty sure it was. There's all steam

00:10.030 --> 00:11.191
back then. Was it like a locomotive? Yeah, but it 
was small, I think. It was just a little small

00:15.496 --> 00:17.578
locomotive. Did they use the lignite to... Yeah, 
fire the boilers. Fire the boilers. They used the

00:23.003 --> 00:26.987
lignite over here on the Gene Railroad, too. Well, 
it's the Missouri Pacific now. It used to be the I

00:29.250 --> 00:31.412
and Gene, you know. Right. International and 
Great Northern. You see them longhorn cattle go by

00:34.355 --> 00:37.060
over there in the Carlos. Longhorn cattle. Yeah, 
the Texas coal mine was on the spur of it. Yeah, nice

00:45.896 --> 00:48.260
empty.

00:55.253 --> 00:58.118
But this Sanity mine over here was a... I think they 
put out quite a bit of coal, too. Santa Fe? Mm-hmm.

01:02.908 --> 01:03.369
Santa Fe. Did your dad cut timber in Santa Fe? He 
sure did. He sure did, you see. I went with him to

01:09.337 --> 01:10.860
open gates, you see. And we'd come out back this 
road here and go over to where we lived.

01:17.269 --> 01:17.429
Uh-huh. Do you know when the Santa Fe mine was 
operating? Let me ask you this. When did your dad

01:22.757 --> 01:24.980
cut timber? How old were you? I was about 9, 10. 
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, along there, you know.

01:32.384 --> 01:33.185
So that would be? I was born in 1904. Something like 
that. Oh, yes. Did your daddy and his brother talk

01:42.700 --> 01:47.567
about the mines very much, or was most of the talk at 
the dinner table? Well, that was just his

01:47.587 --> 01:49.330
brother-in-law, you know. You see, that was his 
mama's, my uncle, my mother's brother that worked

01:49.510 --> 01:54.818
in the mine, you see. My daddy's brother didn't 
work in the mines. Did they talk about mining at the

01:59.288 --> 02:01.431
dinner table? Not so much, not so much. It was just 
an everyday deal with them. It wasn't nothing

02:08.180 --> 02:09.762
unusual. Just get the coal out. Get the coal out and 
get it going. Make that little paycheck. Do you

02:16.692 --> 02:21.058
remember the big rains in the early 20s? It was a big 
flood, I believe. Yeah, I believe that. I do

02:26.090 --> 02:26.550
remember that. Did it harm your house at all? No. 
No, it didn't. Do you remember what effect it had on

02:32.839 --> 02:36.725
the coal mines? Coal mines? No, I really don't 
remember that. No,

02:38.567 --> 02:44.596
my granddaddy at McCoy built him a real good house. 
He was a carpenter, too. Both of my granddaddies

02:45.617 --> 02:47.119
were carpenters. He built him a real good house. It 
was a two-story. It wasn't nothing fine, but it was

02:49.563 --> 02:51.265
good. And he painted it. And he had the, like I said, 
two-story. And it was all right. My daddy, he built

02:59.902 --> 03:02.768
his house, just a common old farmhouse. But he 
built it good. And it didn't damage it. I love to

03:08.288 --> 03:13.858
tell, hear my daddy tell about though, he built a 
house in 1900, that's where I was born. He built it

03:13.878 --> 03:18.445
himself out of logs and notched them, and he built 
the roof himself. He arrived aboard, as he called

03:19.367 --> 03:23.614
them, and made one of them homemade roofs. And when 
that 1900 flood come, hurricane, he'd say, it

03:24.356 --> 03:30.807
didn't leak a drop. See? Oh, so he built it down? He 
built a house, you see, in the year of, you don't

03:32.977 --> 03:36.501
know, because you can't remember. The Galveston 
Flood. A hurricane. Him and Mama, that's where I

03:41.347 --> 03:44.570
was born, see. They lived in Galveston? No, no, 
they lived over here on Grandpa McCoy's place. He

03:48.074 --> 03:50.117
built the house himself, you see what I say. He was 
so proud of it because he built it himself on his

03:50.717 --> 03:58.967
daddy-in-law's place, and he made the boards 
himself and put them up there. All that rain and

03:59.622 --> 04:01.884
rain and wind coming in. He said it didn't leak a 
drop. He was so proud of it. That's where I was born.

04:06.088 --> 04:07.890
I can remember, of course. People could do things 
back those days, you know? Yeah, uh-huh. They did

04:12.134 --> 04:13.355
not in such a hurry. He could do it. He could arrive 
in those boards some way with a, you know.

04:21.082 --> 04:27.368
But you don't remember about the rains in the 
1920s? No, not really.

04:32.039 --> 04:37.387
I thought lots of times people ought to keep a 
better record of a lot of things that'd be worth to

04:32.039 --> 04:37.387
them in the future, you know. But we go along for a 
haphazard, you know, and don't think much about

04:38.308 --> 04:42.574
it. For instance, some of these antiques. That 
would be antiques now if we'd have saved them. Just

04:48.683 --> 04:51.167
maybe throw them away or something, you know. 
Right. But we don't, we can't save everything. Oh,

04:55.070 --> 04:56.151
no. No. That's one reason we like to do this oral

04:56.532 --> 05:07.645
history. It's a

05:07.665 --> 05:16.075
good way to preserve the antiques. Yeah. What 
about World War I? How did that affect Rockville?

05:21.035 --> 05:22.998
Oh, World War I, that's a terrible thing. We took 
daily paper, and every morning my granddaddy

05:24.259 --> 05:31.269
would come over there and mama would read to him. 
See, he was a school teacher, but his eyes had gone

05:31.309 --> 05:34.553
bad. She'd read to him about the war news. We had no 
radios. We did have a telephone, but we had no

05:39.540 --> 05:43.746
radios, no televisions back in World War I. Now, 
you did speak of World War I. Did you have any

05:45.850 --> 05:47.752
electricity? No. No. Coal oil lamps. Coal oil 
lamps. Yeah. Cooked with wood. No electricity. No

05:58.424 --> 05:59.285
running water. No. World War I was the same time. It 
was a terrible time. Yes. Some of the boys right

06:05.211 --> 06:07.594
here around Milano got killed over there. I was 
pretty young at the time, but I remember I wrote to

06:08.895 --> 06:13.160
one of the two of those soldiers. Just because I 
knew them, not because I And just to fast, to help

06:15.348 --> 06:19.072
it, help it. Some of them come back, some of them 
didn't.

06:23.776 --> 06:27.560
Do you remember how that... My daddy had to 
register in that deal.

06:29.462 --> 06:37.550
Did any

06:29.462 --> 06:37.550
of the Mexican miners go out to fight? I'm sure they 
did. I'm sure they did. And the black people too. Do

06:45.925 --> 06:48.949
you remember how the mines were affected by World 
War I? Did there seem to be a lot of mining activity?

06:50.772 --> 06:58.824
Well, really and truly, like I say, I just can't 
remember for sure how it did affect the mines. But

06:59.505 --> 07:02.950
back then, people our age, you know, we was 
thinking about other things. We wasn't, you know

07:04.232 --> 07:05.935
what I mean. Young people, they don't take things 
too serious, you know. I guess it's a good thing

07:10.361 --> 07:11.663
they don't. I find that they're taking you too 
seriously too young nowadays. And a few of them

07:17.294 --> 07:20.039
don't take it serious enough. You know what I mean? 
You know what I mean? They can get hooked on this

07:22.502 --> 07:24.886
dope or something, you know, and that's bad. Or 
this drunk driving. You see, my boy, the one who

07:27.911 --> 07:33.539
works for the IGC now, he was five years in the 
sheriff's office. So he learned a few things. He's

07:35.923 --> 07:38.106
seen lots of things that was pretty bad.

07:42.558 --> 07:46.403
But we still got lots of young, good young people. 
You bet. You know, obviously now the mining camps

07:47.665 --> 07:55.496
are no longer there. That's right. Do you have any 
idea what happened to the Mexican families that

07:57.799 --> 07:59.702
were living there? Have they moved out of 
property? Well, I think they just scattered. A few

08:01.864 --> 08:04.688
of them might have went back to old Mexico, had 
people there. There's one Mexican who lived right

08:06.271 --> 08:08.413
up here a little ways. We sure liked him. He'd come 
down and talk to me sometimes. I can't even call his

08:12.157 --> 08:15.440
name anymore, Sally Garcia, Garcia. And he taught 
me a few Spanish words. And he's buried over there

08:20.164 --> 08:23.327
next to the Spanish cemetery, Mexican cemetery. 
And they just sort of scattered around. Some of

08:26.070 --> 08:28.071
them farmed, and some of them went, a few of them. 
You see, he come from old Mexico. He could remember

08:30.033 --> 08:31.535
living in old Mexico. But he could speak some 
English, you see.

08:38.261 --> 08:38.621
Did he marry here? I think his wife come from old 
Mexico. She stayed at home most of the time. She

08:45.565 --> 08:48.850
didn't go much.

08:49.071 --> 08:56.281
Do you

08:49.071 --> 08:56.281
know of anybody specifically that grew up around 
the mines? No, really, I don't. I imagine they're

08:58.344 --> 09:00.688
over around there somewhere in places. Some of 
them may be around Milano that grew up around the

09:01.529 --> 09:04.533
mines. Do you know of anybody I might check, too?

09:12.738 --> 09:14.640
Is that one thing I forgot? They did have a doctor? 
Oh, yes. Well, I don't know. That is for Big Lump

09:19.384 --> 09:20.445
now. I don't know about the other camps. This was 
Dr. Rob Wallace.

09:27.772 --> 09:29.033
He was a big man. He lived at Rockdale. That's 
right. They'd call him, you know. They had

09:34.959 --> 09:37.281
telephones back then, you know. That's about all 
they did. He'd come out. Then he had a mine

09:40.295 --> 09:41.816
inspector, too. I forgot who he was. Seemed like 
one of my uncles was mine inspector for a while.

09:47.122 --> 09:48.163
Cousin. Mr. Bullock? No. Bullock. Bullock. He was 
mine inspector for a long time. You're right. But

09:55.750 --> 09:58.172
Rob Wallace was the company doctor there. Now, how 
many mining camps he took, mines he took care of, I

09:58.553 --> 10:02.597
don't know, but he did. When my granddaddy got 
hurt, that's the one that come out to him. Did you

10:06.653 --> 10:09.116
take care of the children also, and the wives? I 
don't think so. I think it was just the minors.

10:12.100 --> 10:18.749
Well, how did the wives and kids get medical 
attention? Just like, they had no insurance. They

10:20.651 --> 10:21.512
had no insurance. They just had to pay their own. 
They'd go into Rockville, and the doctor would

10:23.374 --> 10:25.677
come out? Yeah, the doctor would come out there. 
They had no hospital over there. They had doctor's

10:30.303 --> 10:32.686
offices, and they'd come to your home. So if the... 
They'd come to him. That's right. That's right.

10:45.538 --> 10:48.784
Sure did.

10:48.804 --> 10:53.552
But my grandpa's chest was sort of crushed and he 
was broken up in here some. It took him about a year,

10:54.333 --> 10:59.322
like I say, to die.

10:59.362 --> 11:00.985
McCoy. Daniel McCoy. Mama's daddy. That was about 
1906. Yeah, about 1906.
