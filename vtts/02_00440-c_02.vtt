WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:04.206
Yes, and made apologies for it. Oh, was anyone 
killed? No, no. No one was killed. Just a question

00:09.994 --> 00:11.115
of a fight. I don't think there were. There may have 
been minor injuries. I'm not aware. As I recall,

00:18.546 --> 00:21.710
there were no major injuries at any time. Nobody 
had to go to the hospital. And

00:24.554 --> 00:30.763
we...

00:34.338 --> 00:44.850
I told him that we were going to the death school 
with two people involved.

00:44.870 --> 00:49.475
He said that was

00:44.870 --> 00:49.475
satisfactory. We went on back and handled

00:49.496 --> 00:58.646
him, and handled him, and handled him, and the 
court-martialed him, and sent him back to the

00:49.496 --> 00:58.646
state. What was the verdict and punishment? The

01:04.021 --> 01:25.280
punishment was not, was not a gross, a gross

01:04.021 --> 01:25.280
sentence.

01:25.300 --> 01:33.167
I think

01:25.300 --> 01:33.167
we find one of them, the one that started it, and the 
other one that gave him a Did

01:34.868 --> 01:42.318
you have to sit on the court martial? No. No,

01:44.862 --> 01:50.069
I am proven. Do you think that this was part of, you 
know, during the mid-1960s, of course, we had a lot

01:50.089 --> 01:58.681
of black riots, civil rights movements. Was that 
part of this, or did this have an impact on you? Yes,

02:02.037 --> 02:09.385
it did, because this is what this guy told us about 
the impact it was having over in the States versus

02:02.037 --> 02:09.385
what we had there. And we had integrated 
everything. We had no,

02:12.688 --> 02:26.323
the only, he said that they would click together, 
these younger guys, were really the ones causing

02:27.029 --> 02:37.465
them trouble. They would click together. And then 
pretty soon you had a big problem. They'd get

02:45.196 --> 02:49.062
together and congregate together. And that's 
what was causing the problem. What we did was

02:49.903 --> 02:53.008
separate them out so that they were really in there 
and not all put together. So some of them, they'd

02:53.028 --> 02:56.193
separate them as far as the barracks were 
concerned. Yes. Some of them here and now, and all

02:56.645 --> 03:01.431
of them help. But they still go back and get it. 
Sure. Did it decrease the amount of attention?

03:08.339 --> 03:10.101
Yes. It did lower the attention. And we tried to,

03:10.682 --> 03:24.639
well, just everything was made as equal as we could 
make it for everyone. As a matter of fact, my age was

03:24.659 --> 03:25.921
covered. Sorry?

03:29.517 --> 03:32.261
He was helped too. He was helped? He was helped. In 
what way? In the talking about conditions. The way

03:38.390 --> 03:41.435
they saw things. What the problems were.

03:45.441 --> 03:49.387
What did he think of the changes that you made? He 
was formed.

03:54.655 --> 03:56.538
And he felt that you were improving morale? Yes.

04:00.837 --> 04:11.773
That

04:00.837 --> 04:11.773
was a major problem? Oh, in the States, in the Air 
Force, you know, in all the services.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.713
That was the only incident that you had? The only 
incident I had was in the Air Force. Of

04:29.525 --> 04:46.977
course, during this time, Europe has sort of taken 
a second place to war in Vietnam, and did- I thought

04:47.665 --> 05:03.279
that there was a tremendous buildup in Southeast 
Asia, and of course a decrease in supplies and

04:47.665 --> 05:03.279
troops in Europe. Did that have an impact on you and 
the Azores?

05:11.847 --> 05:17.352
I don't think it did, except it slowed down the 
amount of traffic that's come through. Several

05:17.855 --> 05:19.919
big exercises every year. Came through. A lot of 
deployments. Rapid deployments.

05:31.120 --> 05:31.360
Sure. And did you ever have missions or training 
exercises with the Portuguese?

05:40.778 --> 05:40.858
Yes. Unless

05:42.610 --> 05:59.594
they

05:42.610 --> 05:59.594
had

05:42.610 --> 05:59.594
a very small air force. Oh, yes. They only had C-54 
and a couple other small airplanes there. That's

06:02.058 --> 06:02.919
all they had. The only thing, they were Air City 
Rescue. That's all we did. We practiced Air City

06:04.181 --> 06:04.922
Rescue mission.

06:07.990 --> 06:13.538
with that part of the Portuguese Air Force. And 
did, I mean, were you ever called in to help them as

06:13.558 --> 06:18.405
far as RC rescue? No.

06:26.155 --> 06:35.128
How were the relations between your men in general 
on these, or your airmen and your officers and the

06:26.155 --> 06:35.128
Portuguese that lived in that area?

06:38.922 --> 06:47.112
There was no tension at all.

06:47.132 --> 06:54.802
The presence of the base there meant a lot to the 
economy of that island.

06:54.822 --> 07:03.293
It's called the Isle of Tessera, which means the 
Third Island, and it was a third great island.

07:04.927 --> 07:17.385
not particularly blessed with a lot of good land

07:04.927 --> 07:17.385
to raise cows or, I mean, till, much less, and also 
raise cows. We had

07:17.405 --> 07:21.471
a few cows. They raised grapes

07:21.491 --> 07:27.961
and vegetables. That's about all. Now that you are 
a general and now that you're in a diplomatic

07:28.342 --> 07:34.731
position, I would imagine

07:37.698 --> 07:52.334
Well,

07:37.698 --> 07:52.334
we had a lot of pressure on the wives at the squadron 
officer school because we made all the wives

07:37.698 --> 07:52.334
participate. The wives participated in 
everything. Well, not everything, all the

07:54.757 --> 07:58.000
functions. We have a,

07:58.020 --> 08:05.308
as soon as the athletics were over, The families 
would all join together with a section, and then

08:06.419 --> 08:15.952
they'd have hamburgers or cook something, and 
beer, and soft drinks.

08:18.795 --> 08:22.380
Have a big get-together, then we'd have dining in, 
so the wives would all come to those. Normal

08:24.303 --> 08:25.204
clothes.

08:32.170 --> 08:45.124
We had

08:32.170 --> 08:45.124
a big awards night, and all the wives attended. We 
had graduation ceremonies. We did a whole part of

08:46.966 --> 08:47.707
that. And your wife, because you were a 
commandant, was she sort of formally in charge of

08:47.727 --> 08:57.677
the wives who were the instructors and the 
students? Yeah. And in these, or is... Did you or

08:58.985 --> 09:02.571
your wife ever have an opportunity to learn 
Portuguese? Yes, we both did. Oh, did you? Oh,

09:05.896 --> 09:06.076
yeah. When I left. Because I noticed you don't have 
a school here for Portuguese. Usually they have a

09:09.301 --> 09:10.423
school. Well, we

09:10.483 --> 09:16.192
attended school there on the base.

09:20.519 --> 09:20.659
Mm-hmm. One afternoon a week, every week.

09:26.035 --> 09:32.124
I even gave my farewell address in Portuguese. I 
don't know if he understood the word because it all

09:32.144 --> 09:36.870
collapsed.

09:38.292 --> 09:43.700
And then the Air Attaché said he

09:38.292 --> 09:43.700
could understand it. Vince Bennett, the Air 
Attaché, is a guy we worked through as an

09:43.720 --> 09:51.030
ambassador.

09:54.453 --> 09:58.778
He would come over and meet with us periodically. 
What do you think of the quality of the Portuguese

09:58.798 --> 10:08.368
Air Force

09:58.798 --> 10:08.368
and the officers that you have? The officers were 
very impressive, Portuguese officers. Very

10:11.551 --> 10:17.338
proud people.

10:17.358 --> 10:21.422
They don't take time in the criticism because they 
are so proud. So

10:22.465 --> 10:46.651
you never saw a pal on the back of it. We got to be very 
close friends. And he did this here in the States.

10:48.053 --> 10:48.273
No kidding. So we've been back. And they had the 
takeover over there by the socialists. He was

10:49.815 --> 10:50.295
forced to retire. He's

10:51.963 --> 11:16.395
gotten back in since then. He's been doing certain 
jobs for the Air Force. And he's trying to get

11:17.376 --> 11:17.957
there. His retirement reversed, but I don't think 
he will. He may have been present with me, but he's

11:19.018 --> 11:20.340
very bitter towards me. I don't know.

11:25.966 --> 11:28.591
He thinks you're back to normal. Yeah, it seems 
that way.

11:32.858 --> 11:37.346
What were your feelings in here about the 
revolution?

11:37.626 --> 11:44.478
It scared

11:37.626 --> 11:44.478
me. The chance of confidence didn't end. But I

11:49.321 --> 12:03.854
don't think the Portuguese are ready for it. 
They're

12:03.874 --> 12:07.938
just not the type. I

12:07.958 --> 12:11.441
don't believe it. What do you mean

12:11.461 --> 12:15.285
they're not the type? They're too individual. 
They're not going to submit to that type of regime.

12:17.046 --> 12:17.427
I don't believe it. They're more used to it. Almost 
dictatorship.

12:26.946 --> 12:40.326
We were more liable

12:26.946 --> 12:40.326
to go for

12:26.946 --> 12:40.326
that side. Very conservative. But Salazar is 
still in? No, Salazar is in. Well, I know, but was he

12:44.872 --> 12:46.475
in when you were there? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's what 
I meant. And Salazar. Did you have an opportunity

12:51.691 --> 12:54.053
to meet him? What did you think of him? Very 
impressive person. Very. In what way?

13:05.165 --> 13:09.269
He seemed to have command of himself and 
everything. Very sure of himself.

13:17.498 --> 13:21.242
I thought he was doing what was best for the 
country, really. The feeling it gave me was that he

13:21.509 --> 13:39.500
was doing what he thought was best for

13:21.509 --> 13:39.500
the country

13:21.509 --> 13:39.500
all the time. He was not an opportunist. Was he 
friendly with the Americans?

13:45.530 --> 13:47.093
I don't think we'd been there if we weren't. Yeah.

13:51.985 --> 13:56.412
Well, let's stop right here for a minute, okay? Is 
there anything else about the Azores that we

13:56.432 --> 14:00.900
should discuss?

14:16.946 --> 14:17.807
No, I don't think so. Well, you had a real quick next 
assignment, Vice Commander, 12th Air Force Base

14:18.158 --> 14:29.609
at Bergstrom, which only lasted from October 69 to 
May 1970. Why was it so brief? Usually, what's

14:31.090 --> 14:33.612
that, a two-year job? Well, you have no set tours as 
a general officer. You just go when they say and do

14:36.835 --> 14:46.444
what they say, and

14:36.835 --> 14:46.444
your life's not your own. I think they needed 
somebody over in Vietnam in a hurry, because

14:46.660 --> 14:56.053
somebody finished up or something, and I went over 
to finish up the tour. I was happy to get the

14:56.093 --> 15:00.359
opportunity. At Bergstrom,

15:02.682 --> 15:11.554
was it basically a question of hearing, by this 
time, We were training pilots. Our major thrust

15:16.127 --> 15:23.835
was training pilots for replacement pilots to go 
to Vietnam, yes. Now, because of the difference in

15:25.798 --> 15:39.313
that type of war, the jungle warfare versus the 
regular World War II or Korean War, was there a

15:25.798 --> 15:39.313
different emphasis on training?

15:42.922 --> 15:52.832
Well, the emphasis was making them combat-ready 
in the aircraft to perform the missions that the

15:42.922 --> 15:52.832
aircraft was capable of performing. And then when 
they went to Vietnam, they were prepared to do

15:53.953 --> 15:58.237
whatever was required. They could do any mission 
that was required in their particular aircraft.

16:04.764 --> 16:10.009
And most of these aircrafts, of course, were the 
jet aircrafts, even though we did use prop planes.

16:10.029 --> 16:11.190
By that time, they were all. The Vietnamese had the 
props then. One thing about Vietnam was, of

16:14.797 --> 16:20.443
course, the SAM missiles. Did you train them to 
attempt to evade SAMs? Well, you had evasion

16:28.310 --> 16:32.314
tactics, yes, that you taught them. They were 
given all the tactics for SAM evasion, what to do,

16:32.975 --> 16:38.660
and so forth. What were they told to do? They had all 
different. It depends on the situation. And if

16:45.798 --> 16:50.686
they knew that SAMs were firing, well, they took 
evasive tactics. And they were able to maneuver so

16:51.748 --> 16:59.180
that they would not be intercepted. Quite a few, of 
course, during 67 and 68, when they put SAMs in

16:59.200 --> 17:07.833
North Vietnam, quite a few of our fighter pilots 
were shot down. How was morale? Well, morale

17:09.811 --> 17:12.274
wasn't... The morale when I was there was good. 
Now, I'm not sure about how it was back when several

17:14.596 --> 17:20.182
of them were getting shot down. But we had 
perfected electronic countermeasures so that we

17:21.223 --> 17:38.322
knew when they were launched and we knew more about 
where they were because we had ECM aircraft go with

17:21.223 --> 17:38.322
the strikes, especially those in the north that 
not. They all had As well as all the B-52 missions,

17:40.118 --> 17:44.703
too. And the training back at Bergstrom was a lot of 
new technology? Not a gross amount of new

17:50.929 --> 17:52.811
technology. The training at Bergstrom itself was 
only for the RF-4, and that was only for the

17:52.851 --> 17:59.037
reconnaissance. So we had the other bases at Luke 
and Nellis and George and

17:59.057 --> 18:08.387
I don't remember. We had several other bases where 
we were training people on different types of

18:09.177 --> 18:16.344
aircraft. Now, when you got to Bergson, did you 
apply for Vietnam? When you get to be a general

18:20.389 --> 18:22.611
officer, you don't apply for anything. But you 
must have friends and said, gee, I sure would like

18:23.892 --> 18:27.376
to get to Vietnam. I mean, did you tell anybody that 
you wanted to get over there because you were next

18:27.436 --> 18:36.045
to her duty in June of 1970?

18:39.299 --> 18:40.180
It was in Vietnam. Yeah. I was happy to go. I wanted 
to go. As

18:46.365 --> 18:52.371
I said before, when you get to be a general officer, 
you don't ask questions. You just go where you're

18:52.411 --> 18:56.154
told, and if somebody wants you, they'll call for 
you. If they don't, they won't. Okay. Now... You

18:59.197 --> 19:02.079
have no choice in the matter. Right. You were at Tan 
Sonot for the 7th Air Force And you were in

19:09.083 --> 19:13.367
operations. Yeah. What exactly was your job? The 
job was to direct all the operations of the

19:16.369 --> 19:28.880
different organizations

19:16.369 --> 19:28.880
that were under Seventh Air Force. I wrote all the 
ops orders, tell them what to do, and coordinated

19:29.020 --> 19:38.888
with intelligence to send out that information. 
and

19:39.543 --> 20:08.503
directed the reconnaissance missions to fulfill 
the intelligence requirements, and

19:39.543 --> 20:08.503
evaluated the performance of the units below, and

19:39.543 --> 20:08.503
evaluated requirements of what was going to be 
needed in the future for whatever program that we

19:39.543 --> 20:08.503
had, whatever our program was going to be. in the 
ongoing year and

20:08.973 --> 20:36.217
provide the command and the control for the 
direction of the commander to direct the

20:08.973 --> 20:36.217
operation. Now, when you were down there, Was it 
the responsibility of the 7th Air Force,

20:39.331 --> 20:44.638
basically that core area? No, the responsibility 
of the 7th Air Force was the responsibility for the

20:45.680 --> 20:50.927
whole. For the whole Vietnamese theater, but not 
including Thailand. Including Thailand.

20:56.174 --> 20:57.155
Including Thailand. Including Thailand. 
They're everything in Southeast Asia. Okay, and

21:01.140 --> 21:02.302
Okinawa? No, not Okinawa. So who controlled the 
B-52s? The B-52s were, we controlled the B-52s,

21:09.149 --> 21:13.455
their strikes. But we only had operational 
control over them. Right. Then you went back to

21:19.042 --> 21:21.406
Okinawa. Yeah. Okay. This war, of course, has been 
debated by historians now for a long time, and was

21:25.631 --> 21:38.008
debated by the public at large for a few years, 
especially when you were there. And I'd like to ask

21:39.254 --> 21:42.958
you some questions about that war. How did you feel 
that we were getting along with the South

21:43.459 --> 21:48.285
Vietnamese? Well, we were getting along with the 
South Vietnamese Air Force fairly well, but I

21:49.906 --> 21:57.796
don't think we were getting along too well with the 
South Vietnamese people. I think it was a dirty,

21:58.857 --> 22:00.579
rotten mess. It was a no-win war, which is 
ridiculous. The situation that we put our forces

22:05.512 --> 22:14.603
in, we put our people in, was almost inexcusable. I 
just can't see anybody wanting to put the United

22:14.623 --> 22:19.649
States of America in that sort of condition. Why 
don't you elaborate on that? Well, when you get in a

22:22.192 --> 22:35.367
no-win situation and the President of the United 
States has to direct a squadron what it can do, then

22:22.192 --> 22:35.367
something is wrong.

22:35.735 --> 22:56.101
When you tie the hands of your strike force that 
could have ended the war in the very beginning, in a

22:35.735 --> 22:56.101
short period of time, and you tie their hands so 
completely that all they can do is what they're

22:35.735 --> 22:56.101
told they can do that day by the President of the 
United States, then there's something lacking.

22:56.121 --> 22:57.843
And we never will win one like that. That's the 
second no-win thing we've been through. And there

23:02.469 --> 23:04.071
was no excuse to be in the mother. And Korea was bad 
enough, but this Vietnam thing is ridiculous.

23:10.733 --> 23:12.415
It's just a dirty, rotten mess. That's all I can 
say. Okay, now tell me about, give me a specific

23:13.677 --> 23:19.365
example of this no-win situation.

23:23.690 --> 23:26.454
We weren't allowed to bomb in North Vietnam. When I 
first got there, we couldn't bomb in North

23:27.676 --> 23:30.820
Vietnam. We had to get permission. It was directed 
down from above what targets would it hit. So the

23:40.037 --> 23:43.081
Pentagon and the White House controlled... It was 
in the White House. So the White House controlled

23:44.542 --> 23:50.409
the targeting. And that must have caused a lot of 
resentment in Saigon. It did. It caused

23:57.478 --> 23:59.320
resentment everywhere.

24:02.742 --> 24:06.305
And I think Mr. Kennedy could have stopped it from 
the very beginning. So if you don't withdraw

24:06.325 --> 24:08.967
those, we're going to do this tomorrow. We're 
going to bomb this factory or this place or this

24:09.468 --> 24:14.813
place and then go up and do it. And if we displayed 
some power at the very beginning, rather than

24:16.194 --> 24:28.544
keeping completely hands off, there never would 
have been a war in South Korea. They've been

24:28.564 --> 24:31.267
stopped in North Vietnam. We did the same thing in 
Korea. We stopped at the Yalu River. We didn't go

24:35.410 --> 24:37.853
across the Yalu River. So the Chinese came in and 
wiped us out. So as far as China now for a second, did

24:41.136 --> 24:52.488
you agree with John MacArthur as far as we should 
have been bombing north of the Yalu? Yes, I did. Of

24:54.530 --> 24:58.995
course, I don't disagree with President Truman 
firing because President Truman was the boss. And

24:59.756 --> 25:02.719
if the boss says do that, you do it. If you look in 
retrospect, everybody can look back and see what

25:03.138 --> 25:08.085
would have been better and what wouldn't. Most of 
them can. But in my opinion, we would have been a lot

25:11.009 --> 25:15.135
better off if we had gone ahead. They never would 
have come in, in all probability.

25:23.487 --> 25:28.814
Did you sense a lot of resentment in Saigon with 
your superiors? Who was your superior, by the way?

25:30.256 --> 25:33.060
Well, George Brown, who was later chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, What

25:33.412 --> 25:38.618
are his feelings?

25:41.862 --> 25:44.705
I believe he felt the same way, and General Abrams 
did too.

25:49.791 --> 25:58.320
And most of the Air Force, the senior Air Force 
people that I knew felt that way, in my opinion. Of

25:58.340 --> 26:02.305
course, I can't speak for them, but that's the way I 
felt they thought. Now, you made an earlier

26:02.639 --> 26:12.609
statement that we got along all right with the Air 
Force Vietnamese people, but we didn't get along

26:02.639 --> 26:12.609
all right with the civilian population. Could you 
elaborate on that? Well, I don't know what

26:15.511 --> 26:22.638
question of getting along with them, just the 
stories that were told me about encounters with

26:15.511 --> 26:22.638
them. And the Vietnamese people didn't want us 
there, I didn't think. How'd you know? Out in the

26:28.564 --> 26:31.667
boondocks, the people out in the boondocks.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.496
They wanted everybody to go away and leave them 
alone. That was the feeling that you got. That's

26:39.519 --> 26:41.601
the feeling I had. Now, in the... Did you have any 
examples? I mean, did you have any good things to

26:44.884 --> 26:46.585
tell you then? I had a chaplain who was in the field 
with the airborne division tell me that that's

26:48.968 --> 27:03.021
where I got the feeling, the expression of that 
feeling from him, that he got that feeling.

27:07.692 --> 27:33.653
I guess the Vietnamese had been under the French 
and under domination for so long that they were

27:07.692 --> 27:33.653
happy to be away from that, and yet they don't want 
North Vietnam

27:07.692 --> 27:33.653
taking them over.

27:33.733 --> 27:34.234
We were there. We prolonged the war. by being 
there. Or we could have, if we had done it right in

27:39.853 --> 27:47.282
the beginning, they would never have had a chance 
to come in, in my opinion.

27:50.325 --> 27:52.147
What were the conditions like at Pan Snow? As far as 
the Americans were concerned, they were fine.

27:59.996 --> 28:04.902
Comfortable quarters, good flying conditions. 
good facilities, good runways, good radar

28:06.485 --> 28:13.835
control. We've got a good system there, a good 
tactical control

28:15.037 --> 28:26.432
system to take care of the strikes, monitoring. 
How effective do you think that the Air Force was in

28:27.594 --> 28:35.365
Vietnam as far as destroying the enemy? I mean, on 
the missions. Regardless of what the politicians

28:36.607 --> 28:43.815
controlled or which ones you could bomb, et 
cetera, how about the ones that you could? How

28:43.975 --> 28:45.316
effective were they? I think they were quite 
effective. I don't think there's any question

28:46.658 --> 28:50.522
about it. They were very effective. We were able to 
hit the targets. And if the intelligence was good,

28:55.868 --> 28:59.852
we clobbered whatever was there.

29:02.655 --> 29:05.078
But when you can't see through the jungle, We have 
an impossible problem almost. Yeah. To even

29:09.664 --> 29:13.530
assess your game. Sure.

29:16.655 --> 29:24.647
That is a problem, and of course we bombed the Ho Chi 
Minh Trail to death almost, and we still didn't

29:16.655 --> 29:24.647
stop the flow of supply. I'm surprised. Is that 
correct? That's correct. Why not? I don't know. I

29:31.577 --> 29:33.360
really don't know. We may have stopped the flow, 
but they already had so many down there, they

29:34.167 --> 29:37.331
didn't need them. And give them time enough to 
repair and get through. And don't ever think we

29:43.078 --> 29:49.406
didn't bomb it. We bombed the hell out of it. Looked 
like the moon.

29:58.858 --> 30:02.402
What about the Debolian campaign of the ranch 
hands? as part of the Air Force. Is that also under

30:04.067 --> 30:09.854
your control?

30:09.874 --> 30:23.072
This, of course, has come into the news lately, 
Agent Orange, and if that is going to have an impact

30:09.874 --> 30:23.072
on the people who were sprayed, et cetera. And I was 
wondering about your ideas of the use of the

30:23.873 --> 30:28.980
deployments.

30:35.137 --> 30:44.527
Well, I'm not

30:35.137 --> 30:44.527
too sure in my own mind how effective it was. Some 
people think it was quite effective. And others,

30:48.931 --> 30:51.474
like me, they're not quite so sure.

30:55.638 --> 30:56.599
It had some effect. I know that. But to be worth all 
the effort it took, I don't know whether it was

30:58.221 --> 31:05.008
worth it or not. I

31:06.575 --> 31:15.785
just wasn't in a position to evaluate it, really.

31:19.689 --> 31:22.292
What did you think of General Brown? What's your 
opinion on him? He was fine. Fine. Fine,

31:26.597 --> 31:29.941
outstanding soldier. A real professional 
soldier.

31:34.345 --> 31:35.907
How'd you get along with him? What kind of man is he? 
Is he easy along with ours? Is he demanding? No,

31:40.172 --> 31:43.237
he's fairly demanding, but not overly so. He just 
wanted you to do your job.

32:01.562 --> 32:06.349
He was very fair and knew what he wanted. sure of 
himself.

32:13.482 --> 32:17.806
He still was very pleasant to me, and will remain in 
any way.

32:20.948 --> 32:23.951
How'd you, did you, did you know General Abrams? 
Yes. Probably worked pretty close on, on

32:25.412 --> 32:28.195
something. Worked, well I went to his staff 
meeting every week. Yeah. And uh. How was he? He,

32:34.300 --> 32:38.344
he's a, he was a crusty old soldier. of the old 
school. I admired him. Why? I thought he was a great

32:42.518 --> 32:50.270
American.

32:50.290 --> 32:52.293
He was very thoughtful of his men.

32:57.041 --> 33:06.255
He took advantage of every bit of intelligence 
that he could get, and he tried in every way to win

32:57.041 --> 33:06.255
the war.

33:07.838 --> 33:19.212
supportive of the Air Force and their mission, and

33:07.838 --> 33:19.212
the Navy as well.

33:19.232 --> 33:24.900
He was, I think, just an outstanding commander, 
really. He had a grasp of the situation and knew

33:24.920 --> 33:35.093
what he was trying to do, and worked at it day and 
night. Hard working, man. I know he was.

33:40.002 --> 33:50.813
In general, then, it sounds to me that you have a 
very high opinion of the military leadership of

33:40.002 --> 33:50.813
the American Forces in Vietnam. I sure do. I sure 
do.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.101
How about on the other side? How about, let's talk 
about that. I know we talked a little bit about how

34:01.164 --> 34:03.647
you got along with the Vietnamese. Air Force 
people, but, you know, a lot of the blame, I heard a

34:04.201 --> 34:14.832
lot of blame put on the Vietnamese themselves for 
losing their own war, and I'm sure you've heard

34:04.201 --> 34:14.832
that. What's your opinion on that?

34:19.197 --> 34:23.442
Well, I think in a large part that might be true. I 
don't know whether they had any

34:23.462 --> 34:32.892
anything that brought them all together to really 
want to do something. I don't know whether

34:34.559 --> 34:40.407
I'd almost call them lethargic. They didn't want 
to talk about the peasants out in the field. They

34:43.171 --> 34:45.293
didn't know about all this other stuff going on. 
They just wanted everybody to leave and let them

34:45.834 --> 34:48.077
alone. That's the feeling and impression that I 
got from talking to people. And did you take, every

34:55.287 --> 34:59.633
once in a while, did you take trips out in the field? 
Yes, I went to every one of the bases. I flew

35:02.256 --> 35:02.997
missions. You actually were flying some 
missions? Yeah. What kind of aircraft? Well, I

35:08.927 --> 35:12.411
flew one in the F-100, and I flew one in the F-4. As a 
major general? Yeah. They had you fly in missions?

35:17.597 --> 35:20.700
Well, they let me fly missions. Oh, they let you. 
But isn't that unusual? I don't think so. I flew

35:25.125 --> 35:29.750
nine reconnaissance missions. But you didn't fly 
any combat, did you? No. Yes, I flew combat. You

35:35.275 --> 35:37.879
flew, like you flew into North Vietnam? Oh no, they 
were not letting me go into North Vietnam. I was

35:40.522 --> 35:42.124
thinking you would have been captured. I know it, 
that's North Vietnam. So I went on missions in

35:44.306 --> 35:50.193
Vietnam, where they were dive bombing missions. 
And you participated? Yes. I don't know, I just, to

35:54.398 --> 35:56.541
me. It seems incredible that they'd have a major 
general doing that, not only because of your rank,

35:57.685 --> 36:05.974
but also because of your age. What do you mean my 
age? I was combat qualified in the RF-4. Well, I

36:11.660 --> 36:22.611
know that you're combat qualified, but I was under 
the opinion that mostly on these you'd have the

36:11.660 --> 36:22.611
younger men doing these. You do, but you got to know 
something about it. I've always felt that the guy

36:26.913 --> 36:32.842
in charge ought to know something about what the 
guy is asking him to do, what he's asking him to do.

36:33.162 --> 36:33.663
He should know. Oh, yeah. But you went out in 
strafing and dive bombing missions? Yes. I wasn't

36:42.977 --> 36:43.938
doing it. I was in the back seat with a guy in the 
front. I ain't doing the actual firing.

36:56.444 --> 36:59.447
And that was typical for a major general? I don't 
know if it was typical or not. As I say, there were

37:02.850 --> 37:08.215
only three or four missions that I went on. And I 
flew the reconnaissance missions. I was taking

37:09.837 --> 37:10.658
pictures. I actually did those in Cambodia and 
South Vietnam, and also

37:10.678 --> 37:23.430
in Laos. Not with none, no. And what did you find out 
on these missions? What the problem was, when they

37:33.211 --> 37:46.527
were trying to find the tardy in the jungle, and 
even though you mark it, the forward air

37:33.211 --> 37:46.527
controller marks it with smoke, you don't see 
anything but leaves, trees. So you go down and hit

37:46.547 --> 37:51.473
the smoke and hope there was something there. 
Occasionally you get an explosion and know you hit

37:51.493 --> 37:53.856
something. Because you have no idea what you're 
bombing most of the time. You can't jump.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.345
Gee, that must have been really difficult to run 
bombing missions on a night down.

38:10.829 --> 38:11.410
Yes, it was. And difficult for the pilots. What do 
you think about the quality of our pilots over

38:15.296 --> 38:17.459
there? Outstanding. Oh, they were super. compare 
them to our fighter pilots in World War II? They

38:23.860 --> 38:27.445
were much better trained than we were when we got to 
combat in World War II. Really? Oh, yeah. They're

38:28.486 --> 38:29.627
experienced people. I mean, people, we got over 
there maybe with 300 hours of flying. They were

38:37.777 --> 38:41.262
there with 3,000 hours of flying. So there's all 
the difference in the world in the level of

38:41.282 --> 38:46.188
experience. And the machines were all 
complicated, too. Oh, absolutely. And more of

38:50.030 --> 38:53.613
technical, and more firepower. Everything has 
upgraded tremendously.

39:00.479 --> 39:01.259
How could you ever... I know one of the things that 
McNamara wanted to do was to sort of quantify the

39:01.580 --> 39:05.623
war. McNamara was stupid, in my opinion. Well, I 
want your opinion on McNamara. I want you to

39:12.008 --> 39:14.911
continue on that. I think he tried to quantify 
everything and put it in a computer, and you can't

39:14.931 --> 39:19.935
do that, in my opinion. And he wanted commonality 
in everything. And that slowed down the

39:23.855 --> 39:34.128
procurement of weapons because he wanted Air 
Force and Navy to have airplanes that were common

39:23.855 --> 39:34.128
to be the same thing. And he

39:35.270 --> 39:49.888
lost sight of the fact that you had to have these 
things now, not programmed in the future. like he

39:50.948 --> 39:52.089
was trying to do. And he squeezed down on

39:53.892 --> 40:17.783
the budget so that even though we were able to do 
some research and development, he squeezed it

39:53.892 --> 40:17.783
down so much that he cut out most of our research and 
development.

40:18.404 --> 40:21.527
to stay with the state of the art at this time rather 
than progress. Well, that's what I think he did. He

40:24.751 --> 40:27.814
stopped the progression in the state of the art.

40:31.438 --> 40:34.581
There's a lot of resentment in the knowledge area 
about Mackinac. Yes, there was. I guess there

40:36.683 --> 40:37.664
still is. I mean, there was Newman. Did you ever 
meet him? Oh, yes. When he came to Saigon? No, when

40:45.332 --> 40:48.175
he came to Maxwell.

40:51.108 --> 40:56.195
No, I didn't see him inside,

40:51.108 --> 40:56.195
no. When he came to, um, what's it, and you just came 
in to inspect, he talked to you? Oh, he talked to the

41:03.304 --> 41:06.328
War College, yeah.

41:13.698 --> 41:14.078
Yeah, okay. And, uh, usually we'd have a little 
dinner beforehand, and he invited the

41:14.099 --> 41:19.005
Commandants.

41:22.090 --> 41:25.976
For me.

41:25.996 --> 41:28.761
Were people friendly toward him? Oh, yeah. There 
was no

41:30.864 --> 41:37.054
dislike for the man personally. No, I don't think 
so. I don't recall any. You can dislike a man. I

41:44.706 --> 41:48.291
mean, not dislike a man personally, but you can 
dislike what he does. His policy was still like

41:48.311 --> 41:49.954
him, huh? I've got a lot of friends that I love, but I 
don't like some of the things they do.

41:59.783 --> 42:15.080
Now back to Vietnam, and did you ever receive a 
survey from a Brigadier General that served in

41:59.783 --> 42:15.080
Vietnam, and later wrote a book about it, and his 
name was Douglas Kennard? Kennard?

42:16.181 --> 42:20.346
D-I-N-N-A-R-D.

42:16.181 --> 42:20.346
Never did? He sent a survey out to, I guess there 
were 168 generals at one time or the other served in

42:22.570 --> 42:32.045
Vietnam. He sent a survey out to these people and 
asked them questions about why we lost the war and

42:32.065 --> 42:40.738
things like that. You

42:40.818 --> 42:48.430
never did receive any of those? No. At this time, 
you made, or right before that, you made Major

42:49.520 --> 42:53.465
General. Can you tell me about that?

43:01.213 --> 43:04.998
Just that I was eligible and got promoted. Well, 
you got promoted awfully quickly. Well, that's a

43:10.084 --> 43:11.726
lot easier. You only competed with a few people 
there.

43:19.810 --> 43:21.412
second star than it was the first? Sure. Less 
competition. A lot less.

43:28.822 --> 43:32.768
And was that part of filling the job in Vietnam? I 
mean, did you need two stars to do that job? Was it

43:36.793 --> 43:38.616
usually a two-star response going? Yeah. But I was 
promoted before I went. Yeah, I know that. Okay. I

43:45.746 --> 43:47.488
was wondering about Why did we lose the one in 
Vietnam? You alluded to some of this. I like your

43:53.682 --> 43:54.864
answer. Well, because the Air Force's hands were 
tied at the very beginning and they weren't

43:55.866 --> 44:17.256
allowed to go in and

43:55.866 --> 44:17.256
destroy the targets and the will to fight in North 
Vietnam at the very beginning when we had the

43:55.866 --> 44:17.256
capability, when we had the force there to do it, 
and we didn't do it. We could have had them at the

44:18.670 --> 44:26.078
negotiation table a long time ago if we'd started 
bombing North Vietnam even after it was

44:18.670 --> 44:26.078
authorized. That's the way we got them to the 
bargaining table. But we could have won the war

44:28.741 --> 44:34.908
before then without having to go to any bargaining 
table if we'd done just the same thing.

44:38.392 --> 44:42.477
So in other words... And our hands were tied, 
actually, when we were bombing North Vietnam. The

44:42.497 --> 44:45.961
specific targets were picked by the President. 
Sure. In other words, you blame politicians. I do.

44:51.371 --> 44:51.471
Okay.

44:55.417 --> 45:13.102
What about the question of

44:55.417 --> 45:13.102
reporting back to the Pentagon how successful you 
were in the armament of the body counts, which were

44:55.417 --> 45:13.102
not very accurate, according to the generals I 
talked to. You just talked earlier about shooting

45:17.581 --> 45:28.611
in the jungle, how could you, maybe you might see 
something explode, how could you tell what kind of

45:17.581 --> 45:28.611
damage you were doing if you were hitting the 
targets?

45:28.932 --> 45:30.353
Well, if you're in the jungle, you can.

45:34.517 --> 45:46.288
But we had other targets and we could see them and we 
could tell if we shot a truck up or...

45:34.517 --> 45:46.288
And we had other techniques, infrared sensors, 
and so forth. And we had smart bombs, too. They

45:51.551 --> 45:55.695
could hit whatever we pinpointed them on. We had a 
lot of success with that, smart bombs, infrared

45:55.715 --> 46:00.139
sensors.

46:06.305 --> 46:12.951
And when they located troops, we could put 
something on them.

46:14.230 --> 46:19.077
could at least rattle their eardrums and then hit 
them. One of the charges that was made by some

46:19.097 --> 46:31.615
people was that there was careerism in the 
military during the war, and that there was

46:31.949 --> 46:43.923
mandatory for an officer's career to get his tour 
of duty over there, but then the rotation was so

46:31.949 --> 46:43.923
fast that often they couldn't serve, often they 
couldn't do their job very well. For example, most

46:44.023 --> 46:51.632
jobs are rotated in six months, and you were there 
for six months, and it was the same situation.

46:51.652 --> 46:55.777
Could you learn that job in six months? Could you 
learn who your men were? Could you work

46:58.079 --> 47:00.302
efficiently?

47:03.320 --> 47:06.401
Well, I think that's too short a period. I really 
do.
