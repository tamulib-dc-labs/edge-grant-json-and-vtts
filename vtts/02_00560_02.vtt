00:01.634 --> 00:13.220
Did the church discourage or forbid 
relationships with your family and with your

00:01.634 --> 00:13.220
former friends? And what did that have to do in the 
indoctrination process?

00:23.453 --> 00:31.860
The unified family name that they go under 
sometimes, or they weren't at that time, I don't

00:23.453 --> 00:31.860
know if they use that name anymore or not. is a 
reference to the fact that they believed the

00:33.376 --> 00:40.607
church to be the new family of God. It's sort of a 
tribal concept. Moon and his wife are seen as being

00:45.174 --> 00:55.190
the true parents of mankind, which Adam and Eve 
could not be because they had a premature sexual

00:45.174 --> 00:55.190
relationship. And all of the members of the church 
are grafted into that family, in a sense, into the

00:55.210 --> 01:00.598
true family. because of that, this becomes your 
real family.

01:08.119 --> 01:24.426
And so relationships to the former family and 
former friends are only for the purpose, solely

01:08.119 --> 01:24.426
for the purpose of getting them involved in the 
church, getting them to make different kinds of

01:08.119 --> 01:24.426
commitments to the church, whether they will join 
or not, making financial commitments, material

01:08.119 --> 01:24.426
commitments, whatever they are. Now, this, of 
course, if you believe that this is the true

01:26.195 --> 01:40.794
family, and it's the only thing to be involved 
with... Paul, no, don't do that now. Then it

01:40.814 --> 01:49.485
makes sense that if you love these people, you'll 
want them to do this. But it's a classic example of

01:50.680 --> 02:00.695
ends justifies the means, in that whatever you do 
to your family or for your family is only for the

01:50.680 --> 02:00.695
purpose of getting them involved with the church. 
And so all real love and affection that you can have

02:01.116 --> 02:08.166
is channeled into pro-group activity.

02:12.635 --> 02:21.708
And of course, the effect of that is to minimize and 
hopefully neutralize any influence from your

02:12.635 --> 02:21.708
formal life on people. Of course, that's very 
difficult to do to a 100% kind of degree. But I think

02:26.715 --> 02:30.060
this is sort of like a corporate takeover in some 
ways. You only have to have 51% finally, although a

02:30.180 --> 02:38.592
person who's going to vacillate that much is not 
much good to the church. but everyone has little

02:39.415 --> 02:58.875
corners of their psyche that resist control but 
even that resisting control becomes part of the

02:39.415 --> 02:58.875
control because you have guilt feelings about 
that and so that makes you that much stronger and so

02:39.415 --> 02:58.875
if you do if your parents do have some influence on 
you they do make you feel guilty about being

02:39.415 --> 02:58.875
involved or they do make you feel anxiety, that 
ends up making your commitment to the church that

02:58.855 --> 03:12.460
much stronger because the negative response 
against that, the guilt, is part of what connects

02:58.855 --> 03:12.460
you to the church.

03:15.410 --> 03:21.217
My relationship with most of my friends at the time 
I joined the church were very unsatisfactory. The

03:21.257 --> 03:31.068
relationship with my girlfriend at that 
particular point was frustrating, not because we

03:21.257 --> 03:31.068
didn't care about each other a lot, but because she 
was going to the Ivory Coast the following year.

03:32.229 --> 03:34.251
And also I was just not interested in being 
married. While I wasn't ready to propose by any

03:34.391 --> 03:40.178
means, it was a different kind of relationship 
that I was looking forward to. So there was really a

03:40.558 --> 03:42.160
lot of... a lot of things contributing to the 
decline of the influence of my friends and my

03:42.848 --> 03:51.101
family in my life at that time, which, again, is 
typical of college students. I mean, that's a big

03:51.562 --> 03:56.650
part of what college is about, a lot of what makes 
them vulnerable to begin with. But the church

03:57.371 --> 04:02.699
certainly

03:57.371 --> 04:02.699
extends that. Is this all the coffee? Yeah. She 
wants some, too. Can you pour half of it in? Sure.

04:08.028 --> 04:09.310
Thank you. That's fine.

04:15.856 --> 04:21.283
You need so many people here. I don't know if you're 
ready for this one. Okay.

04:29.233 --> 04:33.939
Explain how the divine principle differs from 
Christian theology. Put in the new tape.

04:41.029 --> 04:41.489
Briefly. Briefly, right. 25 words or less. Well, 
essentially, different people approach it

04:45.893 --> 04:55.607
different ways, but essentially Christianity is 
based on the concept of grace and forgiveness. A

04:56.408 --> 05:10.888
sacrifice which, made by Christ,

04:56.408 --> 05:10.888
made it possible for people who were separated 
from God and sinners to be accepted on the basis of

04:56.408 --> 05:10.888
his sacrifice. The idea of grace is a difficult one 
for many people. The Jews have a real hard time with

05:14.655 --> 05:16.658
it. Jewish theologians, that's the thing that 
gets in the way, I think, as much as anything else.

05:22.348 --> 05:24.933
They feel like that's saying that God is not just. 
And I can understand that. And particularly a

05:26.115 --> 05:30.683
group that's had so much, oh, you didn't want to 
feel like this. but has been treated so unjustly

05:30.663 --> 05:34.587
throughout the years, that's really hard for them 
to deal with. But I think that's the essential

05:35.368 --> 05:38.191
basis of Christianity now. The book of James has 
all the business about faith without works is

05:38.791 --> 05:50.964
dead, so you get the Protestant work ethic coming 
through there, and you have a lot of people in

05:38.791 --> 05:50.964
Protestantism probably who are trying to earn 
their salvation, whether they have that theology

05:38.791 --> 05:50.964
or not. But the Unification Church is definitely 
an earn-your-salvation church. I mean, that's a

05:56.752 --> 05:59.756
major theological point. They call it the concept 
of indemnity, and it's a matter of making

06:00.096 --> 06:05.142
spiritual restitution for past sins. And while 
Moon has, in some ways, done it for the whole world,

06:06.464 --> 06:12.592
each of us has to do it on our own. And so you have 
processes of fasting and taking cold showers for

06:12.612 --> 06:23.485
long periods and doing lots of different things to 
pay indemnity for some kind of spiritual price. So

06:23.465 --> 06:25.889
that's a huge difference. There are carryovers 
from a lot of oriental cultural and religious

06:26.310 --> 06:33.884
ideas. The importance of ancestors, the 
spiritual relationships, or the spirits of the

06:34.806 --> 06:43.161
ancestors are seen as being very important. They 
must be released from their spiritual world

06:43.141 --> 06:52.602
prisons by special prayers and rituals. I 
participated in some of those. It was really wild.

06:56.310 --> 06:57.994
Fascinating, fascinating. The view of 
Christology, because of the idea of grace, is very

06:58.278 --> 07:03.303
different. They see that the Christ was supposed 
to have been the conquering hero, not conquering

07:03.323 --> 07:18.338
in the sense of necessarily having to be a military 
conqueror, although military might play a role in

07:03.323 --> 07:18.338
the Unification Church's anti-communist stand, 
for sure. I don't think in the long run that it's

07:18.358 --> 07:23.003
really a military takeover. although elements in 
the church are certainly present where if it

07:22.983 --> 07:29.929
needed to go that direction, it could. But the view 
of Christology, essentially, is that Christ came

07:30.350 --> 07:41.260
to take a bride and to establish the heavenly, the 
perfect family, true family, to become the true

07:30.350 --> 07:41.260
parent. And that's the way they refer to him and his 
wife as the true parents. So that's very

07:47.986 --> 07:52.450
different. sort of millennialist, some 
similarities there. There actually is a group of

08:00.893 --> 08:08.941
Jews, I think, that believes that the fall was 
essentially a sexual fall. I forget which group,

08:09.461 --> 08:14.766
but I've heard that fact. But in terms of 
differences from Christianity, I would say the

08:14.786 --> 08:23.314
business of grace versus works is probably the 
biggest one in the view of what Christ came to do.

08:25.640 --> 08:42.745
The view toward the Bible, of course, they have to 
be willing to use the Bible rather than follow the

08:25.640 --> 08:42.745
Bible because these views that they have do really 
justice to a lot of

08:25.640 --> 08:42.745
the stuff that's in the text. Did you believe that 
Reverend Maine was the Messiah? Yeah,

08:46.050 --> 08:46.711
definitely. All the members of the church. I 
shouldn't say all. It's rumored that one of the

08:50.902 --> 08:57.190
high-ranking theologians has her doubts about 
her. But essentially, being a member of the church

08:57.210 --> 09:03.157
means accepting that fact, or at least living as 
though that were true. Because that's what the

09:03.177 --> 09:04.679
whole thing is predicated on. And they'll deny 
that, of course.

09:10.747 --> 09:14.031
After you joined the group, where did you live? I 
stayed in Manhattan, lived in the center in

09:14.171 --> 09:17.335
Manhattan for a while. I actually went... I was 
actually at home, that is to say in Newton, for a

09:19.960 --> 09:32.156
fairly long period during that first summer, and 
in the hospital for a while trying to get rid of an

09:19.960 --> 09:32.156
ulcer that I had picked up during the school year. 
During that time, the church members visited me.

09:36.801 --> 09:41.968
My dad tried to talk with me, but at that point my 
commitment was a young enough one But it was pretty

09:42.252 --> 09:44.856
rabid. And essentially, I didn't really want to 
talk with people about it too much. I knew that I

09:50.063 --> 09:53.467
wasn't prepared to deal with all the questions 
that people were going to have. I already knew a lot

09:53.487 --> 09:57.333
of what the objections would be from a traditional 
Christian point of view. And my commitment was

09:58.154 --> 10:07.787
essentially a feeling commitment and one that I 
wasn't really willing to question at that point.

10:10.400 --> 10:15.567
So after I went back from there, I think I went to 
Kansas City for a short time to try to help

10:10.400 --> 10:15.567
establish a center there. I went back to Manhattan 
later on in the year. It was thought for a while that

10:18.671 --> 10:23.879
I would try to go back to school and run for student 
body president, which of course would have been a

10:18.671 --> 10:23.879
real coup. I would never have been elected if 
people were too weirded out by me wearing a tie at

10:23.899 --> 10:30.788
school and my beard shaved off. And so I wouldn't 
have had a chance. But in any event, that was

10:33.878 --> 10:36.222
considered. I got a call to join the New Hoop 
Singers, which was a singing group that was

10:36.562 --> 10:50.262
established to accompany Moon on his speaking 
tours to the United States, the tour, the

10:36.562 --> 10:50.262
eight-city tour that started in Carnegie Hall in 
the fall of 1978. And I was in that group until I left

10:51.305 --> 10:56.675
the church. We toured with him then, we toured with 
him again. I don't know if it was later that fall or

11:00.963 --> 11:04.529
in the next year. I tell you, the dates from that 
whole era are very difficult for me to remember.

11:11.582 --> 11:14.427
There are only two or three landmarks that I know 
what the dates were. There were a couple of times

11:14.407 --> 11:18.195
when we had breaks that I remember. We were in 
certain places and I remember events, but

11:18.736 --> 11:23.066
everything is very jumping together. We traveled 
without a whole lot of sleep a lot of the time and

11:23.547 --> 11:30.542
were working very hard all the time. Never had 
enough time to rehearse. It was artistically

11:33.765 --> 11:39.371
extremely frustrating.

11:39.391 --> 11:43.495
Although I had some creative moments while I was in 
the church. I think that that kind of discipline

11:43.876 --> 11:54.387
and intensity can in some instances be a boon to 
creativity because there's so much structure.

11:54.721 --> 11:57.103
And I think most artists will agree. Like for 
Stravinsky, he would set a problem, and once the

11:58.284 --> 12:03.469
problem was solved, the piece was composed. And so 
establishing a structure within which one has to

12:03.549 --> 12:12.878
work is one of the first and maybe the most 
important part of having something happen

12:03.549 --> 12:12.878
creatively. And I did some interesting arranging 
while I was in the church, some things that I still

12:12.898 --> 12:20.064
like a lot. Not much composing. It was almost all 
arranging, as I recall. How

12:24.691 --> 12:42.506
is the structured life used to keep members in the 
church and to get rid of any doubt that they're

12:24.691 --> 12:42.506
having? Well, you know rituals in any culture 
serve to kind of give one stability and structure

12:47.911 --> 12:57.330
and help you make one step to the next without 
having to stop and think about the next one. That's

12:57.791 --> 12:58.552
parallel. You know, if you have to ask why about 
everything you do, then you don't get anything

12:59.113 --> 13:03.021
done. And within the Church, you know going 
working very hard many many hours all the time

13:05.461 --> 13:32.532
seven days a week with very very few breaks 
certainly no long vacations if there was ever a

13:05.461 --> 13:32.532
break it would be like a day-long trip or something 
like that or and often it's not a big festival at one

13:05.461 --> 13:32.532
of those big homes either on the west coast or the 
east coast or wherever you happen

13:05.461 --> 13:32.532
to be um

13:35.633 --> 13:41.019
What that serves to do is give you some stability on 
a day-to-day basis and small tasks to accomplish.

13:41.660 --> 13:44.463
And, of course, that's very important within the 
theology of the church, too. All of these little

13:44.583 --> 13:49.268
tasks have their spiritual role and their 
spiritual component. But it also keeps you from

13:49.329 --> 13:53.553
having time to think very much on your own. You're 
always working with other members. The hardest,

13:55.435 --> 14:04.746
acknowledged by the church, is the hardest thing 
is to have a person go out and try to establish a

13:55.435 --> 14:04.746
center on his or her own. And that would be hard in 
any event, because it's just hard to do that sort of

14:06.110 --> 14:11.327
thing alone. But most of the time, the people live 
in groups, and particularly fundraising and that

14:11.864 --> 14:21.935
sort of thing is done in groups because it just 
takes a lot to keep each other built up. I think the

14:24.278 --> 14:27.521
normal peer group pressure is used. I mean, it's 
peer group pressure the way you see it in other

14:27.741 --> 14:30.605
things. The only thing is that what it's 
reinforcing is a very intense manipulation that

14:30.625 --> 14:39.154
goes far beyond what group pressure can 
ordinarily influence. Were you involved in a lot

14:39.877 --> 14:43.662
of fundraising activity? Some. I was never 
involved on what they called a mobile fundraising

14:44.282 --> 14:49.449
team, MFT. But while I was with the New Group 
Singers, we did a fair amount of fundraising. I was

14:54.054 --> 14:56.698
never a particularly successful fundraiser. I 
was pretty average. I'd average $100 a day.

15:00.262 --> 15:05.150
selling flowers or something like that, or 
between, I would say, 70 and 120. I did get somewhat

15:06.031 --> 15:08.174
better as time went on. The biggest day I ever had, I 
think, was $200. But there are some people who can

15:11.579 --> 15:18.490
do $500 a day for 30 days in a row. I don't think that 
the fundraising is carrying on to the same degree

15:18.470 --> 15:22.296
now. They've become much more involved with the 
business. Of course, all this stuff about the

15:24.840 --> 15:32.792
fishing industry that they were trying to work 
their way in and have, I think, pretty effectively

15:24.840 --> 15:32.792
worked their way in. They were providing cleaning 
services, doing all sorts of stuff. If they would

15:37.840 --> 15:42.908
have followed Moon's advice, he wanted them to try 
to corner the flower market. in the 70s. And if they

15:44.850 --> 15:50.676
would have followed his advice and really been 
organized about it, they could have done quite a

15:44.850 --> 15:50.676
bit, I think. Because the thing is, you know, 
essentially they don't pay the labor at all. And

15:54.981 --> 16:03.670
they order in tremendous bulk, and they sold 
flowers to people

15:54.981 --> 16:03.670
for donations. You know, a dollar for a carnation 
kind of stuff. So the profit was just

16:08.475 --> 16:11.899
unbelievable. And, of course, that's why he ended 
up having so much money. But, no, I wasn't involved

16:18.059 --> 16:21.687
with that much money. Do you think the fundraising 
activities helped strengthen the group's

16:21.707 --> 16:26.698
cohesiveness? or help the members identify more 
with the group? Yeah. Fundraising is very

16:30.838 --> 16:33.382
difficult work. I mean, you're on your feet for 12 
to 16 hours a day. It's unbelievably difficult.

16:40.233 --> 16:47.826
And running a lot of the time, and you're having to 
meet people, and you're having to sell this group

16:40.233 --> 16:47.826
to people all the time. And a lot of the fundraisers 
lied. As a matter of fact, I think all of them

16:50.151 --> 16:52.817
probably. I can't imagine how a person could have 
been a successful fundraiser without doing quite

16:52.837 --> 16:56.825
a bit of lying. So you were involved in the process 
of deceiving the world to try to take away its money

16:56.845 --> 17:04.822
to build up the Heavenly Kingdom all the time. So 
yeah, it was... If you lived through it... And

17:07.668 --> 17:09.591
there's some people who didn't. I mean, I know of 
some people who cracked under the strain. And the

17:13.096 --> 17:15.079
church would just send them home. You know, they 
have a mental breakdown, something like that.

17:18.263 --> 17:19.185
They'd just send them home. No money, no nothing. 
Oh, gosh. It was some terrible tragedy. The first

17:22.569 --> 17:27.116
member from Kansas who joined was on a roll of 
fundraising. He finally had a mental breakdown

17:27.557 --> 17:32.764
while fundraising barefoot in the snow on the East 
Coast. And they just sent him home. He ended up in

17:35.615 --> 17:42.767
Topeka State Mental Institution because his 
family didn't have enough money. Yeah. Yeah,

17:42.907 --> 17:44.350
pretty tragic. Anyway.

17:54.086 --> 17:58.954
But I would say that it does build up the group and 
also... Yes, I do think that those activities, and

18:00.655 --> 18:16.469
the witnessing was carried on in much the same 
manner, but witnessing the members always found

18:00.655 --> 18:16.469
much easier to do or much more grateful because 
they were in the process of actually engendering

18:00.655 --> 18:16.469
positive responses, people who would join the 
church and that kind of thing. But yeah, they did a

18:16.529 --> 18:18.350
lot to build the members up. I mean, that was the 
kind of activity, both of those were the kind of

18:18.471 --> 18:27.438
activity where you were putting your faith on the 
line all the time in difficult actions. And that's

18:27.458 --> 18:29.380
what builds a person up. what was your reaction to 
reverend main's vast personal wealth and did the

18:31.334 --> 18:49.495
church try to justify it at all well yeah the 
justification was built in to the ideology in the

18:31.334 --> 18:49.495
sense that the true parent of mankind deserved to 
have everything and that

18:51.989 --> 18:53.991
You know, that was never an issue. It's very 
interesting. I know for the people outside, boy,

18:55.093 --> 18:59.518
how could he have all this and you have nothing? And 
they obviously don't understand the mentality. I

19:01.981 --> 19:12.052
mean, I think that's one of the best examples I can 
think of of people just being incapable of

19:01.981 --> 19:12.052
understanding the extent to which the mind 
control existed in the group. But that was never a

19:12.072 --> 19:16.177
question for me, and I don't know anyone for whom it 
was a question. Maybe one or two people who were

19:16.197 --> 19:20.342
kind of marginal and people who... in one case I 
know left the church, in the other case I don't

19:20.322 --> 19:26.777
know, on their own, that is to say, deprogramming. 
And that sort of thing happened too. A lot of people

19:29.102 --> 19:39.225
looking at the church from the outside, they have 
to say it's either you have 100% control over them

19:29.102 --> 19:39.225
and they can't do anything on their own, you have to 
let them go by deprogramming, or the other extreme

19:29.102 --> 19:39.225
liberal ideas, Well, it's just like a convent. You 
know, well, neither of those is really true.

19:45.463 --> 19:55.259
People do leave on their own, and there were 
greater and lesser degrees of control, and the

19:45.463 --> 19:55.259
person exerted, in a sense, exerted the church's 
control over themselves. But on the issue of how

19:55.359 --> 20:01.528
much money he had, that was just never a big deal. 
And the thing is, is that...

20:05.665 --> 20:10.973
There was in some ways a beautiful quality about 
the simple lifestyle. I mean, I think that a simple

20:10.993 --> 20:19.647
lifestyle can do wonderful things for a person's 
sense of material value. I will never again be so

20:20.789 --> 20:25.176
hung up about money. I can recall feeling very 
guilty when I bought myself a 59-cent Coke with

20:25.156 --> 20:32.659
money that I had raised in fundraising. And there 
were some members who justified it in saying, you

20:32.679 --> 20:37.214
have to have those kinds of things from time to 
time. And I think those were the wise ones,

20:37.294 --> 20:39.300
probably. But the thing is, when I left, I just 
realized that things are for using. And this is not

20:46.620 --> 20:50.863
universal, but it was a lesson that I took from it. 
Things are for using. They're for enjoying. They

20:54.026 --> 20:54.787
are important. But they are not important in and of 
themselves, but they are important because of the

20:55.588 --> 21:04.556
relationships that can be developed and enjoyed 
and the life experiences that can be had with them.

21:05.037 --> 21:06.638
That's all they're for. And I think there was 
probably a sense of that in the church, at least

21:06.618 --> 21:14.174
with some of the better people who I knew. And like 
when he, when Moon would throw a party and would buy

21:14.875 --> 21:21.469
Big Macs for everybody, he loved McDonald's. He 
went to McDonald's all the time, and he would buy

21:22.210 --> 21:28.002
Big Macs for everybody, and it was like communion. 
You know, some very beautiful, intense

21:27.982 --> 21:31.488
experiences. Or they would fix Korean food, and I 
still love Korean food to this day. And we would

21:36.657 --> 21:42.967
share that, and it was so wonderful, so beautiful. 
He would give gifts, like ties, to the guys who

21:43.147 --> 21:52.062
finished the training session, or take them to New 
York and buy them all new suits, or something like

21:43.147 --> 21:52.062
that. And there was a real... Yeah, it was very 
manipulative, but there were some very positive

21:53.665 --> 22:03.820
feelings and some, you know, that people didn't 
take things for themselves. I don't know any

22:04.260 --> 22:10.449
instances of graft, for example, and that sort of 
thing while I was in the church. I don't know of

22:10.470 --> 22:13.454
people taking money that should have belonged to 
the church. I'm sure there were some, you know. You

22:15.317 --> 22:19.723
have somebody who left the church and took with 
them a whole bunch of money or something like that.

22:20.446 --> 22:26.714
But essentially,

22:20.446 --> 22:26.714
people didn't get hung up on material as much. The 
church was very hung up on material, and they were

22:27.575 --> 22:32.421
trying to get as much of it as they could, for sure. 
But in terms of on a personal level, I think

22:32.902 --> 22:40.432
material things were important because they 
could be gifts, or they were important because who

22:32.902 --> 22:40.432
had given them to them. And there were some 
attractive things about that. But as far as

22:43.615 --> 22:50.244
resentment against Moon, I certainly never 
experienced any, and I don't know if there were

22:43.615 --> 22:50.244
members who did or not. That's not to say that I 
think it was appropriate, that looking back now I

22:51.265 --> 22:57.694
think it's appropriate or that it's right that he 
had those things. If he were who he said he was, who

22:57.894 --> 23:04.543
they said he was, you know, I suppose that it would 
be okay. I don't think... that a person who was the

23:08.422 --> 23:20.143
Messiah would have that much stuff and would

23:08.422 --> 23:20.143
treat it that way, but I'm not in a position to make 
that kind of judgment. What was your diet like in

23:20.163 --> 23:26.194
the center and on tour?

23:26.832 --> 23:27.553
A lot of rice.

23:30.336 --> 23:33.380
Very little meat, of course. We had some cooks who, 
having had experience with macrobiotics or

23:33.520 --> 23:41.189
natural foods, would cook a lot of vegetables and 
we'd have a lot of fruit. Sometimes we ate fairly

23:41.209 --> 23:44.453
well from that point of view. Sometimes we had 
people who knew nothing about it and all we had was

23:44.553 --> 23:51.321
rice and soybeans, a lot of soybeans as well. Very 
little meat, but that was because it was

23:51.301 --> 23:54.845
expensive. I don't think that that was a 
deliberate technique to bring down the line

23:55.465 --> 24:00.490
through deprivation of proteins. Although some 
of that may have happened, I don't know. There was a

24:03.213 --> 24:08.619
time when the New Hope singers were so poor, we had 
to raise our own money as well as rehearsing and

24:03.213 --> 24:08.619
that kind of stuff. That was a common technique 
within the church. Make each group support

24:11.121 --> 24:13.684
itself, plus send in a lot of money.

24:17.167 --> 24:18.709
We lived for a week on peanut butter. while we were 
on tour.

24:24.687 --> 24:26.470
But essentially it was sort of...

24:33.785 --> 24:36.731
I don't know what it would be comparable to. Really 
bad school cafeteria a lot of the time. Now, I've

24:41.690 --> 24:45.621
heard some people say that there was some protein 
deprivation going on. I think that's possible. I

24:46.784 --> 24:52.138
don't think that it was a policy of protein 
deprivation through the church. While we were in

24:53.165 --> 25:00.393
Japan and Korea, we ate better than we did when we 
were in the States. They made sure that we were well

25:00.413 --> 25:01.414
fed all the time. Which meant white rice most of the 
time. I think a lot of us who were redder had brown

25:03.036 --> 25:08.062
rice or some other thing. But white rice is what you 
serve to companies, so that's what we got. We had

25:12.506 --> 25:19.935
some really good meals while we were in, but mostly 
food was very functional. Any thoughts? Lots of

25:22.460 --> 25:24.144
rice and lots of coffee.

25:27.873 --> 25:34.167
What were the circumstances surrounding your 
leaving the church? Tape number four.

25:38.744 --> 25:43.410
In 1973, in October, we had just returned from 
Japan. We had had some really incredible

25:44.271 --> 25:48.898
experiences in Japan and Korea. We played for like 
a million people. I'm sure it was in the range of a

25:52.382 --> 25:54.645
million people. The estimates went from 600,000, 
which I think was people trying to minimize it, I

25:54.665 --> 26:03.277
really do, because it was people as far as the eye 
could see. I mean, it was unbelievable.

26:06.061 --> 26:06.321
Unbelievable. They were not all members by any 
means, don't get me wrong. By no stretch of the

26:09.575 --> 26:15.402
imagination were they even, you know, the church 
members were a small minority. It was a political

26:15.462 --> 26:17.825
rally that was staged. And he used all of these 
Westerners, members of the church, to travel

26:18.806 --> 26:28.357
around Korea trying to get people to come to this 
thing, passing out handbills and stuff like that.

26:28.738 --> 26:31.341
And so the Korean people were very interested. Who 
is this Korean man who has all of these Westerners

26:31.361 --> 26:34.364
running around? You know, it was a good ploy on his 
part. And I'm sure he helped his stock in Korea

26:36.507 --> 26:41.072
quite a bit, particularly with the government. 
But anyway, had a lot of those kinds of

26:42.974 --> 26:46.257
experiences. We came back to the United States. We 
were supposed to have gone through the singing

26:47.219 --> 26:49.821
group I was in, that is. We were supposed to have 
gone through a training session in New York, and

26:50.242 --> 26:55.888
then we would go back into rehearsals. Some would 
be given other assignments, and the group would be

26:55.908 --> 27:01.654
a little bit reorganized and continue traveling 
and performing. My grandmother happened to be

27:01.634 --> 27:15.335
fairly ill and in the hospital at the time, and I 
hadn't seen her in years and hadn't been, since I

27:01.634 --> 27:15.335
had joined the church two and a half years, and 
hadn't been with my family for quite a while. And so

27:15.576 --> 27:19.982
when they discovered that, since ancestors are 
very important, they allowed me to go home. Now I

27:20.002 --> 27:26.292
had a dream before I left, the night before I left, 
that my parents were going to try to deprogram me,

27:20.002 --> 27:26.292
and I was responsible. to tell my able. But I knew if 
I did, I wouldn't get to go. So one of the very few

27:30.922 --> 27:42.507
insubordinate things that I ever did when I was in 
the church, a minor thing to a degree, but, well,

27:30.922 --> 27:42.507
they wouldn't consider it minor, of course. But I 
did go home.

27:46.572 --> 27:49.297
My parents had tried to talk me into leaving the 
church before. My dad had flown out, had spent

27:49.357 --> 27:53.886
Christmas with me that year, the previous year, 
72. He spent Christmas with me instead of with the

27:53.906 --> 28:01.341
family before I left for Japan and Korea because he 
tried to talk me to stay. He never even really

28:02.114 --> 28:03.878
raised the subject. I mean, he knew from the 
discussions we were having that it was evil, but

28:04.600 --> 28:11.676
what we did, we were able to spend a little bit of 
time together since he had come out to see me. The

28:12.818 --> 28:13.861
church respected that. I mean, they realized that 
he had made a tremendous sacrifice to come out to

28:13.881 --> 28:18.030
see me. And so they were willing to let me spend some 
time with them. Although certainly not days on

28:24.114 --> 28:28.060
end, you know, but a few hours here, a couple hours 
there. Anyway, so they allowed me to go home. And

28:31.946 --> 28:38.095
she was out in Colorado Springs, so I flew into 
Wichita and drove out to Colorado Springs with my

28:31.946 --> 28:38.095
folks. I don't think the church knew that I was in 
Colorado Springs. I had thought that she was in the

28:43.002 --> 28:50.942
hospital in Newman, which is where my parents 
live, in Newman, Kansas. So I don't think they knew

28:51.924 --> 28:54.210
where I was. I don't recall that detail very well. 
But in any event, we went out and we visited my

28:57.754 --> 29:01.118
grandmother in the springs. And I have an aunt and 
uncle who live there. They told me that they had a

29:04.183 --> 29:15.239
Sunday school party that was being held up in the 
mountains, and they needed to take up some pots and

29:04.183 --> 29:15.239
pans. So we went out to dinner at a cafeteria, and 
then we took off up in the mountains, and I was

29:15.259 --> 29:22.189
exhausted, and I fell asleep in the back seat. And 
so I got into the, went into this house, cabin up in

29:23.182 --> 29:41.157
the mountains and met some people from the Sunday 
school class and went downstairs and my dad

29:23.182 --> 29:41.157
introduced me to Ted Patrick and I found out the 
party was for me.

29:45.153 --> 29:46.155
Very interesting. This was in the evening. I don't 
really recall what time, I suppose. 8, 9 o'clock,

29:51.563 --> 29:53.586
10 o'clock. I don't really know. Anyway, there 
were some big guys there. And I knew that I was not

30:00.136 --> 30:05.524
going to be able to walk out the door. And I also 
knew, they were up in the mountains, and I knew, you

30:05.504 --> 30:09.649
know, I had no idea where. I just, I had no idea at 
all. I had fallen asleep, you know, so I was, could

30:11.851 --> 30:18.058
have been in Wyoming, probably, or New Mexico.

30:20.741 --> 30:24.486
So I sat down there, and Patrick was using his 
standard lines. He would sit there and ask me

30:24.526 --> 30:31.473
questions about the church, but he had his own 
answers, you know, so he'd ask me a question, I

30:24.526 --> 30:31.473
would give him the standard line, and he would say, 
no, this, this, this. And he baits people. He would

30:35.137 --> 30:44.131
read passages from the Bible, like the one about, 
let no man have you called him father, or this sort

30:35.137 --> 30:44.131
of thing. And he would insert Moon's name. Do not 
let Sun Myung Moon have him call you father. It's

30:49.459 --> 30:50.441
just to make you angry. And in some ways, that's a 
pretty good tact, just because once you start

30:50.921 --> 30:57.111
getting angry, then you start drawing on your own 
personal resources. And once you start doing

30:57.091 --> 31:10.568
that, then you begin to realize the distance 
between, the member begins to realize the

30:57.091 --> 31:10.568
distance between his or her own personal feelings 
and own morals and own standards of judgment in

30:57.091 --> 31:10.568
those of the church. And that's the beginning of 
the process of breaking away.

31:16.516 --> 31:17.597
I was a little... I mean, I knew what this was going 
to be like. I had a sense. We had already talked

31:21.432 --> 31:24.395
about it in the church, and I had heard stories from 
people. And also, I kind of had a sense of what it

31:24.455 --> 31:26.977
would be like. I mean, I just could imagine it in a 
way. And so I essentially faked through the first

31:30.381 --> 31:32.903
evening. And I knew I was supposed to have an 
emotional breakdown and embrace my parents and

31:33.684 --> 31:38.709
tell them I had to go back to the church, and I did. 
And so they were real happy, and Patrick was happy.

31:42.613 --> 31:44.095
He was like, oh, he's going to be fine. He'll be 
fine. Well, I don't know if they had a sense of how

31:45.742 --> 31:49.387
much I was faking or not. I don't really think they 
did. I've been through enough deprogrammings to

31:50.889 --> 31:55.696
have a pretty good sense of what happens on the 
other side. And I think they thought it was over,

31:56.177 --> 32:03.687
that there might be some problems that they didn't 
know. But anyway, so Patrick left the next

32:03.707 --> 32:09.235
morning. He left

32:10.193 --> 32:23.233
a couple of former members there with my family and 
my aunt and uncle and their friends who were

32:10.193 --> 32:23.233
serving as security. I knew that they were going to 
want me to sign a statement saying that if I went

32:24.314 --> 32:34.530
back to the church I wanted them to, I gave them 
permission to have police come in and take me out.

32:34.510 --> 32:53.330
And I knew that in order for that to have any kind of 
legal binding effect, they were going to have to

32:34.510 --> 32:53.330
have at least a

32:34.510 --> 32:53.330
signature from the media.

32:53.350 --> 32:55.653
You know what I'm talking about.

32:57.195 --> 32:58.476
You know what I'm talking about. Notary.

33:03.816 --> 33:04.257
Yeah. So I knew they had to have at least a notary, 
too. And so I thought what I would try to do was get

33:08.229 --> 33:13.967
them to take me to a law enforcement office to sign 
it. or at the very least have a notary public come

33:15.027 --> 33:17.731
out. I figured that was the contact with the 
outside world, the objective outside world. The

33:21.036 --> 33:24.221
next morning I saw that we were right close to Pikes 
Peak. And so I figured if that fails, then I would

33:24.642 --> 33:41.929
just simply take one of the chairs from the living 
room and throw it through the window and myself

33:24.642 --> 33:41.929
after it and I'll head for the peak and certainly be 
able to get out somehow, you know, get forestry

33:24.642 --> 33:41.929
service or something. So that was my plan. Well, I 
was able to persuade them to take me to a law

33:43.371 --> 33:49.798
enforcement office, a local sheriff's office, to 
sign this paper. We walked into the sheriff's

33:50.379 --> 33:51.721
office. I went up there on a Thursday night, and 
this was Saturday. I went to the sheriff's office

33:56.306 --> 33:59.510
Saturday morning. And I walked in, and I told the 
guy, listen, these people are holding me against

33:59.850 --> 34:04.135
my will. They're trying to force me to change my 
religious beliefs, and you are responsible for

34:04.456 --> 34:09.722
protecting me. My dad nearly had a heart attack. I 
have never seen him so close. And the guys were just

34:18.373 --> 34:22.939
livid, the guys who came along with him. There were 
two guys. And all three of them were just going

34:26.224 --> 34:28.247
crazy. They were screaming and yelling. And they 
just couldn't believe this was happening. And I

34:31.592 --> 34:34.697
was sitting there very coolly trying to explain to 
this guy. He happened to be the undersheriff. Why

34:37.521 --> 34:39.443
it was that he had to give me asylum. I said, I'll be 
happy to talk to a psychiatrist. I'll be happy to

34:43.269 --> 34:49.357
talk to lawyers or whatever, but do not let them 
take me back because they're holding me against my

34:43.269 --> 34:49.357
will. Well, there was a children of God compound 
not too far from there. And when they started

34:54.775 --> 35:11.324
talking about brainwashing, and he saw that I was 
sitting there very coolly, calmly, just talking

34:54.775 --> 35:11.324
to him very normally, while my dad was on his knees 
pleading with me to go back, and these other guys

34:54.775 --> 35:11.324
were screaming their heads off. I think he 
realized that probably something like that was

35:11.465 --> 35:15.191
involved. He didn't want to get involved in any of 
that, so he let them carry me out of there. And he was

35:19.531 --> 35:20.693
really liable. I mean, we could have sued him up one 
side and down the other so bad. Well, at that point,

35:24.221 --> 35:31.556
I knew that it was probably not my sense of mind 
anymore, that I had blown my best chance. And that

35:32.458 --> 35:37.288
if there was a chance to escape, I would, on the 
other hand, if the truth's the truth, you know. So

35:37.669 --> 35:39.092
we sit and talk about it. And if it's the truth, 
fine. I don't have to worry about it. And I figured

35:42.469 --> 35:48.737
that I would end up letting them get much closer to 
what I really believed and just be much more open

35:42.469 --> 35:48.737
with them. And so I did. And what happened was, 
during the next week then, these people who were

35:49.418 --> 36:00.612
staying with me, they hadn't been in the church 
nearly as long as I had, didn't know half of what I

35:49.418 --> 36:00.612
knew. Patrick didn't know half of what I knew about 
the church, I don't think. He was showing me films

36:04.277 --> 36:06.760
and telling me all this terrible stuff. And I was 
saying to myself, you don't know nothing. Having

36:10.679 --> 36:13.545
been in Korea and Japan, I had heard some pretty 
weird stuff. I had been traveling with women. I had

36:17.013 --> 36:19.799
served as a bodyguard for them. They just had no 
idea the kind of things I had been doing or the kind

36:21.283 --> 36:25.853
of stuff I knew about the church. So as time went on, 
we read Helter Skelter and parts of Helter

36:27.048 --> 36:32.521
Skelter. And I recognize some similarities, and 
there really are. I think that people who say that

36:36.450 --> 36:40.439
that's just scare tactics are wrong. I think that 
there are some similarities. very obvious

36:43.366 --> 36:46.091
similarities between the two groups. The Jones 
People's Temple, same thing. There are a lot of

36:48.575 --> 36:49.617
similarities. The ideologies are different, and 
some of the tactics are different. They tend to be

36:52.602 --> 36:55.226
much more violent, of course, than the 
Unification Church. But the same kind of control

36:55.327 --> 37:05.965
exists, I firmly believe, and I think could be 
demonstrated by looking at psychological

36:55.327 --> 37:05.965
profiles.

37:06.856 --> 37:30.241
Anyway, after a few days, one time we were sitting 
down, and I was reading a passage from Matthew, a

37:06.856 --> 37:30.241
business about how Jesus is accusing the 
Pharisees of being whitewashed tombs, and

37:06.856 --> 37:30.241
talking about how, you know, you

37:06.856 --> 37:30.241
make these proselytes, you know, more fit for hell 
than yourselves. You know, the passage I'm

37:30.261 --> 37:33.825
talking about, Matthew 24, something like that. 
And I realized that because of the deception that

37:35.172 --> 37:47.270
the church engaged in, and I was involved in it, and 
I was very aware of it, and it bothered me on a

37:35.172 --> 37:47.270
personal level, even though I could understand 
the reasoning for it and was committed to it as a

37:35.172 --> 37:47.270
committed member of the church. I realized how a 
person could really hold that up against the

37:48.131 --> 37:54.080
church and say, you know, that's a real drawback. 
And the first time I read it, it really affected me

37:55.122 --> 37:58.466
emotionally very deeply. The second time I read 
it, much less than the third time, it didn't affect

37:58.486 --> 38:01.551
me at all. But at that point, I was aware enough of my 
own responses emotionally. But suddenly I was

38:08.703 --> 38:10.606
thinking, well, that's really wrong. It really 
shouldn't be that way. That's not the kind of

38:11.908 --> 38:13.310
person I am. And I really resented the kind of 
emotional manipulation that I had been subjected

38:13.991 --> 38:21.823
to and was subjecting myself to as a member of the 
Church. And I began to, and I realized very

38:22.965 --> 38:34.423
quickly, and it was something I had probably known 
but not allowed myself to be conscious of, was that

38:22.965 --> 38:34.423
my commitment to the Church was essentially a 
manipulated one. It was not an authentic one, as I

38:34.403 --> 38:41.378
said before, one that was carefully reasoned and 
thought out and made from the basis of a lot of

38:34.403 --> 38:41.378
choices. It was one that I was forced into, and 
coerced into, and deceived into, most

38:41.398 --> 38:48.955
importantly. And that made me really angry. And 
all of a sudden, I just had this overwhelming urge

38:51.076 --> 38:54.662
to feel my own feelings. Now, that may sound very 
bizarre to you, but I really felt like I had been in

38:54.722 --> 39:02.876
the process of only feeling what the Church wanted 
me to feel for such a long time. And I had a real

39:03.417 --> 39:06.282
desire just to feel my own feelings. And it was like 
there was anger there, but I wasn't experiencing

39:07.143 --> 39:11.230
it. It was kind of a strange, almost dissociation. 
And in order just to feel... My own anger and my own

39:17.080 --> 39:21.086
hurt, I started hitting the wall. I still have 
scars on my hands from hitting the wall in that

39:23.009 --> 39:28.336
basement. And my hands started bleeding and I 
started sobbing, just terrible choke, you know,

39:29.778 --> 39:35.767
horrible choke. Choked sobs, just bleh. That was 
it. At that point, I had a tremendous sense of

39:41.609 --> 39:49.498
sadness that I knew that I could never be the same. 
There was an element of relief to it, but it was a

39:49.518 --> 39:52.601
great deal of grieving. It was sort of like 
realizing that your marriage isn't going to work.

39:59.569 --> 40:04.254
Something you've committed yourself to forever 
is just not going to work.

40:06.576 --> 40:10.020
It was very painful, but I think even if I would have 
gone back to the church, I would have loved it. It's

40:11.047 --> 40:23.341
interesting, since that time, I haven't had this 
dream for a long time, and the dreams have changed,

40:11.047 --> 40:23.341
but from that time on, for a number of years, I 
dreamed about going back to the church and going on

40:11.047 --> 40:23.341
with life. It's like I knew that even though there 
was attraction for me there, I had some wonderful

40:23.361 --> 40:37.257
experiences there and some beautiful friends, 
wonderful people, and some very beautiful

40:23.361 --> 40:37.257
experiences, very intense, of the kind that only 
come in that kind of intense encounter. Not to say

40:37.237 --> 40:39.060
that kind of intense manipulation. I think it can 
happen in other ways. And I've certainly had many

40:40.722 --> 40:42.845
beautiful experiences since. All the more 
beautiful because they happened in and of

40:43.846 --> 40:54.762
themselves among adults

40:43.846 --> 40:54.762
who had freedom of choice. Even so, there were 
still attractions and things that I had liked

40:54.962 --> 41:03.835
about it and people who I had loved that I could 
never go back and stay.

41:07.257 --> 41:12.123
The whole process was about, we were in that cabin 
for about two weeks. After five days, I was done. I

41:15.708 --> 41:19.072
had left the church inside. Not to say that I would 
never have gone back at that point, but like I said,

41:19.112 --> 41:25.159
I think I would have left eventually. After two 
weeks, I think I was very settled. They weren't

41:31.989 --> 41:37.900
secure about me at all, and of course, after the 
trick I pulled at the Hunter Sheriff's Office, I

41:31.989 --> 41:37.900
don't blame them. But, oh, less than a month later, 
they let me out in the car by myself, and I had a

41:38.601 --> 41:50.764
sense, pulling up to a stop sign in Newton, well, I 
know that I could head down the street and be in

41:38.601 --> 41:50.764
Wichita at the center in an hour, and just... It was 
kind of fun to know that I could do it if I wanted to,

41:50.744 --> 41:54.573
but I knew I didn't want to. That was it. For me, it 
was a very clean break, an emotional abreaction.

42:03.502 --> 42:08.107
But for many people it's not, and it's too bad. 
Because it makes it much easier, like I said,

42:08.127 --> 42:12.492
dealing with the guilt and the feeling of 
responsibility. As a matter of fact, I even had one

42:12.512 --> 42:17.818
person say, you know, you really don't take 
responsibility for that experience. And I had

42:17.838 --> 42:21.842
just to admit to myself, no, there's a way in which I 
don't. I feel like a lot of the responsibility for

42:21.862 --> 42:24.946
me getting involved lies with the Church. And I 
won't say none of it lies with me. And not that I

42:29.978 --> 42:36.264
didn't learn a lot of valuable things, but the 
sacrifices were extraordinary. And the

42:36.344 --> 42:45.012
commitment, extraordinary as it was, and as much 
of a learning experience as it was, and you can

42:36.344 --> 42:45.012
never say this was better or that was worse about 
your life. I mean, I sort of take it as a piece and

42:45.032 --> 42:49.636
feel like in the whole I've been very lucky. Still, 
I think it was primarily a negative lesson in my

42:50.917 --> 42:55.541
life. And while I would not say that the 
Unification Church is something that should be

42:55.561 --> 42:59.985
outlawed, I

42:59.965 --> 43:09.362
think that there needs to be sort of a truth in 
advertising kind of enforcement that happens by

42:59.965 --> 43:09.362
groups like that. And I don't know how much the 
government can do. It's a real quandary. That's

43:14.992 --> 43:20.020
why I've done a fair amount of lecturing and stuff 
like that to try to help educate people. I feel like

43:20.041 --> 43:22.024
that's the best thing that can happen. But the 
level of manipulation that goes on in coercion in

43:22.696 --> 43:33.586
that group and the level of deception that is 
involved is really not evident to the outside

43:22.696 --> 43:33.586
world. People who've not been through it, I don't 
think, can really appreciate it. And I don't say

43:38.727 --> 43:40.329
that about a lot of things. I firmly believe in the 
value of symbolism and the ability of people to

43:40.409 --> 43:48.640
share experiences through art, for example, and 
stuff. And I hope someday to write an opera which

43:48.660 --> 43:51.944
will help people understand. I wouldn't even 
write it just for the... to be anti-cult. Just to

43:56.310 --> 44:05.322
say, this is a very intense human experience which 
is worth trying to explore through the different

43:56.310 --> 44:05.322
kinds of symbols that are available to artists. 
But I think, essentially...

44:09.187 --> 44:15.400
You know, it's like trying to

44:09.187 --> 44:15.400
make the association between

44:17.675 --> 44:18.877
a lake and the ocean.

44:22.063 --> 44:26.271
The two are both bodies of water, but they're so 
dissimilar. When I'm speaking, I have such a hard

44:26.952 --> 44:31.801
time coming up with metaphors that will help 
people understand. I use a Chinese fire drill to

44:32.362 --> 44:41.539
talk about group pressure and how differently 
people behave than they would by themselves. But

44:41.519 --> 44:42.721
it's really hard. Most people just can't imagine 
letting somebody else decide who they're going to

44:44.465 --> 44:47.210
marry. I mean, it takes them into the realm of 
fantasy. And they can't imagine how that can

44:50.076 --> 44:52.541
really happen. And they don't understand the 
tremendous psychological dynamics that have to

44:52.561 --> 45:00.016
be in play in order for that to take place. But I was 
looking forward to it. I was a committed pacifist

45:02.495 --> 45:11.344
who had gone through a very painful transition 
from wanting to be a Marine to finally rejecting

45:02.495 --> 45:11.344
violence as a means of solving human problems. And 
that was a very carefully-reasoned and mature

45:12.285 --> 45:16.650
choice that I had made. I say mature, maybe rather 
presumptuously, but it was certainly the most

45:16.930 --> 45:23.818
difficult process I had gone through. And I tossed 
it all over in the matter, really, of a few minutes,

45:23.838 --> 45:28.823
when I joined the Unification Church. was willing 
to go to war for South Korea, not even just for the

45:29.562 --> 45:38.452
United States. So it's a really extraordinary 
thing, and there's hardly any explaining it. It's

45:47.363 --> 45:49.125
just sort of a phenomenon. I'm not suggesting that 
people become involved to experience it, but to

45:49.145 --> 45:56.413
see the degree to which an individual can

45:58.705 --> 46:05.070
give up their own choice-making responsibility 
and opportunities is really amazing. And it's a

46:07.025 --> 46:08.086
frightening lesson. I think that the parallels 
that have been drawn between it and Chinese

46:08.807 --> 46:18.175
brainwashing, although I think brainwashing is a 
very bad term, because it's not really a washing of

46:08.807 --> 46:18.175
the brain. The Chinese think that they wash away 
the old character and install a new one. That's

46:21.558 --> 46:24.040
their materialist point of view. It's evident 
from the people who go through that process and

46:24.241 --> 46:28.965
come out that, at least on the short term, that's 
not what happens. Because most people who come out

46:29.585 --> 46:37.032
end up being much more similar to what they were 
before they went through it than what they were

46:29.585 --> 46:37.032
after the process. and certainly you don't have 
the kind of physical torture that some of the

46:37.012 --> 46:51.320
Westerners went through, but if you examine the 
process that the Chinese intellectuals went

46:37.012 --> 46:51.320
through in China, the similarities between that 
and what happens with the Unification Church are

46:37.012 --> 46:51.320
very frightening. If you take away the element of 
enforced participation, which happens in China,

46:58.257 --> 47:11.400
The Unification Church gets participation 
through deception, and giving people something,

46:58.257 --> 47:11.400
or making them think they're getting something 
that they're not, other than what they're

46:58.257 --> 47:11.400
getting. If you're willing to make that 
substitution, then the similarities are

47:12.122 --> 47:20.316
unmistakable.
