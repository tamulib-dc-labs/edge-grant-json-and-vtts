00:02.073 --> 00:09.523
As things, as we talk and things occur, I'm 
certainly willing to move you into some kind of

00:02.073 --> 00:09.523
discretion or digression, excuse me. My first 
question is, how did you develop your interest in

00:09.603 --> 00:12.386
oceanography? What was your career leading to 
your service in Washington? Well, my interest in

00:17.593 --> 00:22.079
oceanography came before I went to Washington. 
I'd gone to school at New Mexico State University,

00:23.221 --> 00:32.012
Las Cruces, New Mexico, and majored in physics and 
minored in math, and I had planned to do graduate

00:32.566 --> 00:35.231
work at Stanford University. I had a fellowship 
all lined up right after my graduation. And about a

00:39.700 --> 00:49.920
week before graduation, I drove up to Stanford to 
talk to the professor that I was going to be working

00:39.700 --> 00:49.920
with and got it all set. And on the way back from 
Stanford to New Mexico, I picked up a copy of Life

00:50.181 --> 00:55.030
magazine. and saw a two-page article on 
oceanography in Scripps. So I decided Scripps was

00:59.972 --> 01:02.696
on the way back to New Mexico. So I stopped into 
Scripps and met another physicist there. Rusk was

01:09.544 --> 01:10.745
his name. And he introduced me to Walter Monk, and I 
talked to him for the rest of the afternoon about

01:12.067 --> 01:22.460
what oceanography was all about and so on, and 
became interested in it. I went back to New Mexico.

01:25.688 --> 01:29.932
decided that I'd rather be in oceanography than in 
physics. So I wrote a letter to Stanford and turned

01:29.992 --> 01:38.079
down my fellowship and wrote a letter to Walter 
Monk saying I'd be there in a week, see what he could

01:29.992 --> 01:38.079
do for me. Now, I'd had three and a half years in the 
Navy immediately prior to that, where I was a

01:39.060 --> 01:46.266
quartermaster and worked on charts. And so I had a 
little bit of feeling for some of the kinds of

01:46.406 --> 01:54.413
things that I thought oceanography involved. And 
I lived near the oceans all my life in Southern

01:55.068 --> 01:58.272
California. So it was kind of a natural, I think, to 
go into it. Well, like I said, about a week later, I

02:02.298 --> 02:07.225
drove out to Scripps. And I went in to see Walter 
Monk and asked him how I went about either getting a

02:07.245 --> 02:16.738
job or getting enrolled. I wanted to do some 
graduate work. And at that same day, Teddy Bullard

02:24.667 --> 02:42.148
Sir Edward Bullard from England arrived, and he 
needed a graduate student to work for him, so they

02:24.667 --> 02:42.148
paired the two of us off, and we spent all that 
summer, that was in 1949, working on heat flow

02:24.667 --> 02:42.148
work. This was the first heat flow work that had 
been done at sea. A little bit had been done by Hans

02:44.972 --> 02:53.442
Pedersen and the Albatross expedition, but he 
hadn't made any successful measurements, so We

02:54.113 --> 02:55.315
started in on that. I spent a summer with Teddy, 
which was an absolute delightful summer. Neither

02:59.522 --> 03:02.767
of us knew much about La Jolla or Scripps at the 
time. But it was a great summer. Got me started in

03:06.072 --> 03:07.594
oceanography. Then I went on and got my master's 
degree there in 1951 and worked for a number of

03:07.634 --> 03:21.336
people at Scripps. Primarily, John Isaacs, I 
would say, was the main person after working on my

03:22.295 --> 03:28.943
thesis material. But I worked while I was there 
closely with Roger Revell, who was director. He

03:34.950 --> 03:40.277
was my most immediate thesis advisor, so I worked 
as close to him as anybody. Actually, Roger was an

03:40.297 --> 03:48.867
interesting person because he would come in in the 
morning and he'd run scripts during the daytime.

03:49.148 --> 03:51.070
He was just director at that time. In the evening, 
I'd go over to his house about 8 o'clock every

03:51.877 --> 03:57.384
night, and we'd work about 3 o'clock in the morning 
on science. Almost every night. Much to the

04:01.048 --> 04:07.936
consternation of Ellen, his wife, objected to us 
spoiling all the evenings doing that. But in a way,

04:07.977 --> 04:10.339
I kind of grew up with one of their families. I spent 
several years in this kind of pattern, so I got to

04:10.359 --> 04:16.387
know Roger and his family very well.

04:20.972 --> 04:21.613
I left... scripts in 1955 to go to the Office of 
Naval Research. I'd like to interject a couple

04:30.041 --> 04:31.302
questions here. Did you work on heat flow from 49 to 
55? That's right. And you worked with Isaacs on

04:35.406 --> 04:36.968
heat flow too? No, I worked with John Isaacs on 
another program. The heat flow was the basis of my

04:40.993 --> 04:45.177
thesis for my PhD. And I worked primarily with

04:45.978 --> 04:52.225
Roger Revelle on that. A few other people that I 
don't recall their names right now. A physicist

04:58.107 --> 05:02.292
who is from San Diego State was working there, 
worked with me. And every once in a while, projects

05:03.674 --> 05:08.481
would come up. And being a graduate student, you 
had cheap labor there, so I'd get off on these. And

05:12.747 --> 05:16.772
some of these were measuring waves at the bomb 
tests at Bikini. Now, I want you to say a few words

05:16.792 --> 05:22.380
about that. Let me back off just one step from that. 
I guess it was in 1951

05:27.311 --> 05:44.094
that we went out on a mid-pack cruise, which was the 
first Scripps cruise after the war that went from

05:27.311 --> 05:44.094
San Diego to Hawaii and back. And I did heat flow 
work on that. The first heat flow work was

05:46.317 --> 05:48.840
accomplished on that. That was followed by their 
Capricorn expedition that went out from San Diego

05:53.326 --> 06:04.702
to the Marshall Islands and then down to Fiji, 
Samoa, Tahiti, and so on and back. And we got a lot of

06:04.782 --> 06:07.967
heat glomations on that. And those two cruises 
formed the main basis for my thesis work. There

06:12.413 --> 06:19.283
were a few other shorter cruises afterwards, but 
that was the main part of it.

06:21.085 --> 06:24.568
51, I believe it was, I went out to the bomb tests. I 
participated in, oh, three or four of these

06:24.788 --> 06:36.379
different bomb tests, which I designed some 
instruments that could be set underwater. It was

06:36.419 --> 06:38.261
essentially a very simple thing. It was a pan 
inverted with a screen on the bottom and a

06:38.301 --> 06:44.427
basketball bladder inside. It would be half 
filled with air, then ran a tube up to the surface

06:44.867 --> 06:50.873
and to a recorder in the boat. And it required scuba 
diving to set these. They were set in about 60 feet

06:54.411 --> 06:56.074
of water. I can remember the first day I went scuba 
diving, I was out in bikini with Bill Bascom, who

06:57.275 --> 07:06.928
was quite an accomplished scuba diver at the time. 
And he said, put the lung on. We put it on. We walked

07:10.113 --> 07:11.154
into the surf. And he said, if you get water in it, 
just turn up your head and blow on it and blow it out.

07:16.261 --> 07:17.603
And he said, try it once. And I tried it once. And 
then we took off. There we were. Went right down to

07:20.881 --> 07:22.863
60 feet. That's the only lesson I had in scuba 
diving. Quite different than it is today on that.

07:29.692 --> 07:31.714
But we would go out there. And Phoenix Jennings was 
out there on part of this. Set these instruments.

07:38.643 --> 07:43.508
And I can remember the first H-bomb test. I've 
forgotten exactly when that was. We were out

07:45.671 --> 07:46.392
there. and had instruments set on it. The test went 
off, and it went about five times larger than they

07:48.695 --> 07:52.238
expected. And it radiated all the area in our 
campground where we had our tents and clothes and

07:53.139 --> 08:00.666
equipment. But fortunately, everything that we 
had was self-contained in a trailer. So we moved

08:06.551 --> 08:10.695
this aboard a ship, and it wasn't contaminated 
inside. We'd lost all our clothes. All I had with me

08:11.976 --> 08:16.800
was a bathing suit and toothbrush that I'd taken 
out in the carrier. So we were able to keep in

08:18.907 --> 08:25.396
business on that, but it wiped almost everybody in 
the test scene out of business for about a month. So

08:25.437 --> 08:30.764
we spent the month out there tuning up the 
instruments and so on until the next series of

08:25.437 --> 08:30.764
tests started. I think we were out there three 
months or so on that test. And the plan of the day

08:36.012 --> 08:43.062
would be to go out and go around all the 
instruments, set them, make sure they were all set

08:36.012 --> 08:43.062
to record. Then we were usually the last person to 
leave the lagoon we needed to set our instruments

08:48.640 --> 09:16.285
just sort of before the test, so we'd take off in the 
helicopter, fly out to the aircraft carrier,

08:48.640 --> 09:16.285
watch the blast go off from the aircraft carrier, 
and then we'd take a helicopter and we'd be back in,

08:48.640 --> 09:16.285
and they'd drop us off in a boat, and we'd go around 
and pick all our records up, and we were the first

08:48.640 --> 09:16.285
ones back in the scene afterwards, so we were kind 
of the last to leave and the first back after all

08:48.640 --> 09:16.285
these tests, and they were really interesting 
tests, and we a good set of measurements on what the

09:17.598 --> 09:22.324
waves were like that were generated from these 
tests. Were you working with Walter Munk then on

09:23.465 --> 09:25.628
the wave measurements? No, that was primarily 
with John Isaacson. John was working on those and

09:30.354 --> 09:35.881
John went out on several of those tests himself.

09:40.667 --> 09:41.368
Let's see. Well, it was after those series of tests 
and Gordon Lill came back to visit me at Scripps,

09:47.804 --> 09:58.622
and he and John Adkins from ONR tried to talk me into 
coming back to Washington. It was right at the

09:58.762 --> 10:05.433
beginning of the IGY getting organized for it, 
which was in 1957, and this was in 1955. And they

10:06.915 --> 10:12.124
wanted me to help back there, and I felt like I was 
getting in a rut at Scripps. I was spending more and

10:12.184 --> 10:13.947
more of my time working on these programs and less 
and less trying to finish up my thesis. So I felt

10:17.900 --> 10:27.651
that the only way I'd really get myself to get right 
down to it was to get away from that atmosphere. So I

10:28.072 --> 10:28.993
went to Washington. And then it took me four years 
after going to Washington before I finished up

10:29.033 --> 10:34.860
PhD. It was working evenings and weekends. It was a 
long, drawn out thing, which I finally managed to

10:36.382 --> 10:41.908
get in 1959.

10:46.225 --> 10:52.953
When I first went to work for ONR, Gordon Little was 
my boss there. And we were in the geophysics

10:53.053 --> 10:56.737
branch. We had three sections in there. There was a 
meteorology section, earth physics section, and

10:58.879 --> 11:05.026
an oceanography section. And I came back to head 
the oceanography section. Dick Better was

11:07.910 --> 11:11.614
actually working in the oceanography section at 
that time. Gordon was head of the branch.

11:17.714 --> 11:20.238
And it was a nice, good little group. It was one of 
the most interesting places I've ever worked.

11:24.866 --> 11:26.509
Gordon is a great guy to work for. And it was a can-do 
place. The whole atmosphere around there was if

11:31.317 --> 11:36.706
somebody had a good idea, we'd find a way to do it. 
And that not only went with the scientific part of

11:37.427 --> 11:42.996
the group, but the contracting part of ORNR was 
that way. And this is really in contrast to almost

11:43.634 --> 11:50.083
any agency that exists in the federal government 
now, even NSF. If something comes up, the

11:51.726 --> 11:56.533
questions are, what are the problems about it? All 
the reasons why you can't do it instead of just the

11:56.553 --> 11:59.718
other way around. And I think it made ONR really a 
great place to do things from. A lot of good science

12:05.606 --> 12:10.333
was supported just because of this attitude that 
existed there.

12:15.190 --> 12:19.236
Well, I worked for ONR for 10 years.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.031
I started as head of the oceanography group and 
then worked up to being head of the geophysics

12:22.000 --> 12:29.031
branch when I left. Gordon had left to go to 
Lockheed, somewhere along there, and I took over

12:29.131 --> 12:38.665
his job.

12:38.685 --> 12:41.650
I don't know whether there's anything about that 
particular era that's... Yes, I have several

12:41.670 --> 12:44.674
questions about ONR I'd like to ask. You

12:45.042 --> 12:52.070
were at ONR when the Mansfield Amendment came 
through. That's correct. When was the date of

12:53.752 --> 12:55.014
that? I think it was 61. 61 is when the Mansfield 
Amendment came through. I was there. Some people

13:02.843 --> 13:12.354
have maintained that the Mansfield Amendment 
almost ends the productivity of ONR vis-a-vis

13:02.843 --> 13:12.354
oceanography. By the time it becomes more and more 
narrowly construed on what kind of age you go to

13:14.506 --> 13:19.871
oceanography, oceanography suffers. Would you 
agree with that? No, I wouldn't agree with it. I

13:24.155 --> 13:28.539
think the timing is approaching being right. That 
ONR was becoming less and less a factor in not only

13:28.579 --> 13:36.087
oceanography, but all science about that stage. 
Because oceanography was getting close to being

13:37.108 --> 13:41.171
20 years old or something. NSF had been going, I've 
forgotten when NSF was started, but it was in the

13:43.075 --> 13:50.403
50s sometime. It started out with a small budget, 
but it was growing, and it was obviously the place

13:52.345 --> 14:00.794
that should be supporting science for science's 
sake on a broad basis. There was no doubt that ONR

14:02.175 --> 14:08.402
was going to have to restrict its interests 
somewhat. Now, when I was there, we were keenly

14:12.472 --> 14:26.388
aware of this situation, and I urged the Chief of 
Naval Research that it ought to support more

14:12.472 --> 14:26.388
things like oceanography and worry less about 
mathematics, psychology, nuclear physics, and

14:12.472 --> 14:26.388
so on. And indeed, there was a shift toward that 
during this time. And the Chief of Naval Research

14:31.394 --> 14:39.323
that was Admiral Layden at that time was very 
sympathetic to that point of view. I think one

14:39.843 --> 14:49.675
could justify supporting oceanography, even in 
its broadest sense, vis-a-vis supporting the

14:39.843 --> 14:49.675
whole broad science. But now, the Mansfield 
Amendment came into effect in 61. And as I recall,

14:53.200 --> 14:56.464
it was only in effect for one year. But it had a 
lasting effect that's there even now, because a

14:57.465 --> 15:09.040
lot of the agencies say we've got to be 
mission-oriented, particularly the Navy on

14:57.465 --> 15:09.040
this. Guys like Proxmire look at things and gives 
his Golden Fleece Award if they're too far off the

15:09.779 --> 15:19.852
beam on these kind of things. I think this has 
pervaded the whole business and has hung on for a

15:20.793 --> 15:26.020
long time. But I think it was probably a timely 
thing that if you hadn't had a Mansfield

15:27.121 --> 15:37.474
Amendment, you probably would be running into the 
same situation in any case. I think by this stage of

15:38.129 --> 15:45.539
the game that O&R would be phasing out a lot of 
things. I would have hoped that they could have

15:47.562 --> 16:05.166
stayed strong in oceanography, that it could have 
been one of their major fields, and that it might

15:47.562 --> 16:05.166
support roughly a third of the work that's going on 
in the business now.

16:05.382 --> 16:14.598
NSF should be supporting about a third, the Navy 
about a third, and NOAA from a civilian agency, the

16:05.382 --> 16:14.598
civilian side, supporting about a third. That 
kind of balance, it seems to me, makes more sense.

16:18.826 --> 16:20.008
And I think that's the way it's headed. The 
military has just faded off into the business, and

16:20.048 --> 16:27.521
that's as it should. It's built way up. during 
World War II, and it's phased down to a level, but

16:31.235 --> 16:36.722
it's gradually phasing down.

16:39.946 --> 16:44.651
So I think it shouldn't play as much of a role as it 
did at one time. I'm not going to name their names,

16:46.173 --> 16:59.790
of course, but several of your colleagues in 
federal agencies at the time when you guys were so

16:46.173 --> 16:59.790
active there maintained that this was the most 
creative time of the federal bureaucracy, that

17:00.192 --> 17:11.288
they feel as if there were more excitement in your 
agency, in other agencies, NNSL, about this time

17:00.192 --> 17:11.288
than ever before. And somehow I have inferred or 
have at least drawn the conclusion that it's not

17:12.029 --> 17:21.883
like that anymore. Now, what I'd like you to 
comment on is both phases. Do you think this is

17:26.049 --> 17:27.151
true? And if it's not like that anymore, why? Yes, I 
think it was true. I think being in Washington was

17:32.852 --> 17:35.494
fun at that time. I don't think it's that way 
anymore. Those are the exact phrases they all use.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.438
It was once fun, it's no longer fun. It's a chore 
now. You're justifying everything. At that time,

17:43.021 --> 17:46.203
you could build programs. It was very 
freewheeling. And I think one of the reasons for

17:49.386 --> 17:55.872
this is that science was on a very steep part of the 
curve going up at that time. And there was more

17:55.932 --> 17:58.414
money each year. more money significantly above 
inflation on it so that you're on an expanding

17:59.103 --> 18:27.068
curve and you could do creative things on that now 
the budgets have leveled off and are approaching

17:59.103 --> 18:27.068
inflation or maybe going up slightly with respect 
to it but not much and there's more competition for

17:59.103 --> 18:27.068
every dollar I think in part this is the reason for 
this is that science has just become very

17:59.103 --> 18:27.068
expensive and you know you can't do everything in 
science anymore. There's a lot of things that

18:29.611 --> 18:34.217
people can do if you had the money, but there just 
isn't enough money to do. At that time, I think the

18:35.438 --> 18:38.222
situation was the other way around. The 
technology was such that you could put your money

18:38.242 --> 18:48.215
into the new kinds of technology, and you could 
afford to support all of the new technology at that

18:38.242 --> 18:48.215
stage of the game. And that made it an exciting time 
to be there. And I think this is just gone, and it

18:52.460 --> 18:56.886
won't be recovered again, just by the nature of the 
beast. Now things are so sophisticated

18:59.363 --> 19:05.570
that even in oceanography we can't do. We could 
spend all the money that's budgeted for science if

19:05.590 --> 19:16.263
we really wanted to, and you just can't afford to 
put priorities on things like that. OK. Now

19:16.283 --> 19:28.577
others, in this case not your colleagues, but 
people contemporaneous with you, maintain that

19:16.283 --> 19:28.577
one of the reasons why the ONR was so innovative 
then was that the tendency towards block funding,

19:29.468 --> 19:43.368
the idea to invest good ideas, and they maintain 
that now, with the concept of peer review and

19:29.468 --> 19:43.368
careful justification, that that can't happen 
anymore. What are your feelings about peer review

19:43.728 --> 19:49.016
and careful justification of your project?

19:51.920 --> 19:58.429
Well, again, I suspect this is related more to the 
situation that exists then and now. And when I was

20:00.549 --> 20:05.957
in ONR, we didn't have peer review. We had a group of 
people that looked at programs. We made judgment.

20:10.444 --> 20:16.553
We tend to bet on people, good people we supported, 
and gave them a lot of leeway to do what they wanted.

20:17.514 --> 20:21.540
And I think we had good results on that. We weren't 
forced to justify our money so much, and therefore

20:22.421 --> 20:27.589
we didn't, in turn, pass this on to the people that 
we were giving money, as long as good results were

20:27.805 --> 20:32.249
coming in. I think the way we used to play the game in 
ONR is that we considered we'd put something like

20:34.251 --> 20:48.786
60 or 70 percent of our money on what we called blue 
chip research, just first-rate people in the

20:34.251 --> 20:48.786
business. We'd just give them the money they 
needed and let them do what they wanted. And we used

20:52.930 --> 20:55.112
to take a smaller percentage of it and play the big 
risks. And they were kind of the fun things to play.

21:01.602 --> 21:04.427
Some of them panned out, and some of them didn't. 
And that's a very fine line between what's a blue

21:04.527 --> 21:09.515
chip and what's a big risk on it. It's no straight 
line, but it gradates into it. I think as money has

21:14.062 --> 21:21.454
become short, And even when I left the Navy, it was 
getting to be more and more of a job of justifying to

21:23.138 --> 21:42.018
DDR&E and other places your budgets, that you had 
to become more critical of where you were spending

21:23.138 --> 21:42.018
the money, get these people to write more specific 
proposals. And then you had to have some way to

21:42.158 --> 21:44.861
review these. And I think the peer system, I don't 
know that it was ever initiated as such, but I think

21:50.915 --> 21:56.843
it just grew, particularly in NSF. I think even in 
the early days of NSF, there was a good possibility

21:57.884 --> 22:09.279
that the program managers could make decisions on 
what they wanted to support and so forth. And this

22:09.319 --> 22:16.028
has gradually disappeared over the time, where 
for one reason or another, including

22:16.582 --> 22:24.290
congressional pressure that they're forced to 
justify decisions they make on these, and they

22:16.582 --> 22:24.290
need to send it out for review, get written 
reviews, and so on. It's more of a protective

22:24.310 --> 22:32.138
mechanism than an innovative mechanism of doing 
research. It's to make sure that if they get in

22:32.158 --> 22:35.602
trouble, they can show that they're right. Again, 
it's just the opposite kind of attitude that I

22:35.662 --> 22:44.091
think existed in that time, where There was an 
attitude to go out and do. If there was a good idea,

22:46.357 --> 22:48.641
you'd go out and do it.

22:52.086 --> 23:01.159
I can give you an example of an interesting thing 
that happened in O&R when Gordon and I were there,

22:52.086 --> 23:01.159
which shows you the flexibility we had.

23:04.143 --> 23:06.086
Bill Van Dorn from... This was right after Sputnik 
went off. Bill Van Dorn from Scripps came in with an

23:08.109 --> 23:11.614
idea of...

23:14.564 --> 23:15.806
putting something into orbit. And his idea was to 
essentially bore a hole in the ground and put about

23:17.348 --> 23:34.152
three or four atomic bombs on it in a projectile and 
fire them off one after the other as it went off to

23:17.348 --> 23:34.152
fire this fairly heavy payload into orbit. Well,

23:34.172 --> 23:38.639
it was an interesting thing at the time. And 
Rockefeller was in town. And we got Bill Baskin. I

23:44.787 --> 23:50.053
remember Bill Bascom got Rockefeller involved in 
it. He and Rockefeller came over to my house one

23:51.594 --> 23:55.979
evening and we discussed this whole thing. We 
decided we ought to classify it at that time

23:56.880 --> 24:01.845
because it was an interesting idea. As

24:01.865 --> 24:13.798
a result of this, we gave a physicist at, well I'm 
not sure where it was, I think it was the University

24:01.865 --> 24:13.798
of Illinois, $50,000 to make a feasibility study. 
to see whether this made any sense to put something

24:14.572 --> 24:19.116
in orbit this way, just looking at the physics of 
it.

24:22.279 --> 24:37.795
Here's something that has no relation to 
oceanography or hardly any relation to the earth

24:22.279 --> 24:37.795
sciences or atmospheric sciences, yet we could 
spend money that way and what we thought was a good

24:22.279 --> 24:37.795
idea and follow it through. In actuality, as a 
result of this, it was a great long classified

24:37.815 --> 24:43.380
study that which I don't know how it ever came out, 
but went into the whole program looking at it. But

24:50.014 --> 24:52.116
we had flexibility. You could do things like that, 
and nobody complained as long as you thought it was

24:52.136 --> 25:00.427
a good idea and could sell it that way. I feel that 
that's the kind of flexibility and attitude that

25:01.749 --> 25:08.297
you're not able to have. I'm not sure that a lot of 
people wouldn't like to have it in Washington. Now

25:12.463 --> 25:12.743
I I think the climate has changed there where it's 
just not possible to do that.

25:24.528 --> 25:27.091
I only have one more comment along that line.

25:29.995 --> 25:42.190
Some people maintain that to have that sort of 
flexibility, not only do you need to return back to

25:29.995 --> 25:42.190
the earlier days of ONR, but possibly what you 
ought to do is make amends manager and then

25:42.710 --> 26:11.451
responsible for the decisions and not 
responsible for not responsible to the peer

25:42.710 --> 26:11.451
reviews that is what they're saying is that now the 
peer reviews have become the managers rather than

25:42.710 --> 26:11.451
sort of the advisory committee to a competent 
manager if that's good enough put for it yes it is

25:42.710 --> 26:11.451
and i agree completely with it and i think this is 
still the way onr is run that is the people you know

25:42.710 --> 26:11.451
in onr that are supporting oceanography they make 
the decisions and they have to stand on it whether

26:11.583 --> 26:39.278
it's good decisions or bad decisions bad decision 
their funding is going to get cut off as is

26:11.583 --> 26:39.278
everybody's that gets funded for them and they may 
call on people for advice but they're not they're

26:11.583 --> 26:39.278
no fall guy for them and i agree that the the peer 
review system has gotten to be a way of shedding the

26:11.583 --> 26:39.278
responsibility and and really trying to play 
things as safe as possible, which I don't think you

26:39.916 --> 26:43.861
can do in research. I think it's tending in the 
wrong direction there. Now, what it takes,

26:47.806 --> 27:04.487
though, if you're going to have a group of people in 
NSF that's supporting programs and they're going

26:47.806 --> 27:04.487
to have to live or die by it, it takes good people 
there. And I think That's probably another thing

27:08.975 --> 27:13.099
that has changed over the years. When I was in ONR, 
ONR had some of the top scientists in the country

27:14.460 --> 27:20.685
working there. I mean, absolutely first-rate 
people that have become college presidents and so

27:22.066 --> 27:27.051
on since they left there. They were first-rate 
people. They put their time in and they made

27:29.233 --> 27:32.015
decisions on this. NSF has had good people and does 
have good people, but I think, by and large, what

27:38.422 --> 27:57.543
NSF has tended to do is bring in young people 
because of the difficulty of getting people to

27:38.422 --> 27:57.543
come to Washington, young, immature people that 
are not capable of making decisions on this, and

27:38.422 --> 27:57.543
then they have to fall back on the peer review 
system in order to make good judgment. They're

27:57.664 --> 28:00.387
just not capable of doing it themselves. And I 
think this is important because you have a lot of

28:00.487 --> 28:06.994
very young people that haven't been around Well, 
as a matter of fact, you've anticipated a question

28:08.088 --> 28:10.953
I have. How do you explain that, let me draw a 
scenario for you. Roger Revelle, ONR, split in

28:16.121 --> 28:24.635
NSL, yourself, Finn and Jennings, Isaac's going 
back, and how do you explain the ending of that?

28:24.655 --> 28:25.757
Because that no longer happens. When somebody 
goes to the ONR desk now, it's almost as if they're

28:25.777 --> 28:31.105
looking for a sabbatical.

28:34.851 --> 28:34.952
Yeah. Well,

28:38.058 --> 28:42.923
I don't know

28:38.058 --> 28:42.923
how you explain that now. Even in the early days of 
NSF, I think a lot of scientists went there and

28:43.704 --> 28:56.416
spent two or three years there as just sort of part 
of their careers to do that. I don't detect that so

28:57.798 --> 28:59.500
much now. I think what you tend to get are people 
that stay in Washington all the time. that never

29:09.074 --> 29:15.344
leave, and then you have an influx of people that 
come in for a very short period of time, like a year

29:09.074 --> 29:15.344
on this. But I think ONR had, I don't know what the 
mean life of people was during that, during ONR's

29:17.407 --> 29:31.950
early stages, but I would suspect it was more like 
five years or something of that order. And now I

29:33.512 --> 29:36.617
think, well, the mean life of all, all people in NSF 
may be the same, but I think it breaks down into two

29:36.985 --> 29:40.791
groups. You have one group of people that comes in 
for about a year, and then you have another group of

29:40.811 --> 29:46.481
people that never leaves. If I look at the section 
of NSF I know best, most people have been there ten

29:48.063 --> 30:01.305
years or more, I guess. Well, they haven't been in 
NSF necessarily, but they've been in the

30:02.298 --> 30:11.530
government one way or another for a very long 
period of time. Now, maybe that isn't bad. I don't

30:12.691 --> 30:13.132
know. I tend to feel that you sort of get stale in any 
job after a period of time. It probably makes sense

30:20.581 --> 30:23.905
to move on. Those of us who are not administrators 
maintain five years. I wouldn't say more like

30:28.170 --> 30:31.815
seven, but... that order of time, you know, the 
government is a tough place to work if you come in

30:32.116 --> 30:40.928
from the outside and don't know anything about it. 
And it really takes something like two years to get

30:41.509 --> 30:49.199
up to speed so you can really know how to do things in 
the government. And then you can be innovative for

30:49.219 --> 30:51.803
maybe five years after that. Then you start going 
over the same ground again. And I suspect that's

30:54.386 --> 30:58.572
pretty much true in any job. I would think five to 
seven years is... is a time people should move on,

31:01.563 --> 31:06.116
particularly in administrative spots. I'm 
saying that knowing that I've been in this spot 12

31:07.901 --> 31:10.729
years now.
