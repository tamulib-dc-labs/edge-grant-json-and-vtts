00:02.191 --> 00:08.459
Do you feel as if the students should work more 
today to develop their own tools and processes?

00:08.499 --> 00:12.265
Would this make them feel more one with the 
environment? Well, I don't think they should. But

00:16.270 --> 00:20.536
everything is sort of a trade-off. And certainly, 
when you do develop your own equipment, you

00:20.576 --> 00:31.270
develop more interest in the data. and you 
understand more exactly the limitations of your

00:32.347 --> 00:36.754
data. But this is enormously time consuming and in 
the modern world, or much better off, to be able to

00:37.976 --> 00:47.511
buy equipment off the shelf. I would never want 
people to go back and do it the way we did it. It's

00:54.422 --> 00:59.991
like asking whether you would rather go to 
California by covered wagon or by by auto, but

01:02.114 --> 01:10.246
there isn't much you can say, but you certainly, 
when you go by covered wagon, you see more of the

01:02.114 --> 01:10.246
country. What about the idea of financing 
students? Several people have commented they

01:14.812 --> 01:27.330
think the students are too well financed today in 
terms of doing graduate work, that you acquire

01:14.812 --> 01:27.330
technicians rather than people who are 
innovative in attempting to identify with new or

01:14.812 --> 01:27.330
old fields. Would you agree with that? Well, I 
would say Yes, there's a certain element of truth

01:32.658 --> 01:35.261
there.

01:38.865 --> 01:56.405
The ground rules, when Irma and I were a student, is 
that we were paid this amount of money for

01:38.865 --> 01:56.405
assisting Shepard, but then anything which 
really applied to our thesis work, we were

01:38.865 --> 01:56.405
supposed to do on our own without any salary or 
compensation. So we were being paid more or less

01:57.487 --> 01:59.509
half time a dollar a day and the other half, but we 
could spend half that time working on our thesis.

02:05.978 --> 02:07.560
But this was sort of without compensation. We 
really was not considered cricket to be supported

02:08.622 --> 02:13.648
in your research. And well, this goes back to the 
philosophy of even professors in those days were

02:14.809 --> 02:19.956
taught to teach. And research was thought to be 
kind of fun you could have as a compensation for

02:20.717 --> 02:26.685
doing this chore of teaching. You weren't really 
compensated for it. for doing research. This was

02:30.272 --> 02:32.194
sort of your personal enjoyment. And that, of 
course, is not really a valid philosophy. And I'm

02:39.682 --> 02:41.604
glad to see it go by the board. So I don't agree that 
students should do thesis work without support.

02:46.369 --> 02:52.155
But at the same time, they tend to become perennial 
students. And certainly at places like Scripps

02:52.596 --> 02:56.580
and elsewhere, they And also, the staff members 
are part of this conspiracy, because they like to

02:57.488 --> 03:03.334
have this assistance. And they tend to assign 
students to do a job. They hire them, and they

03:06.157 --> 03:10.461
control their work too much. I must say that Henry 
and I were encouraged. In fact, we more or less

03:15.186 --> 03:18.489
selected our own pieces. It was our idea to do just 
what we did, within the general context of using

03:19.590 --> 03:27.158
some of the data our work there, so this is quite the 
whole philosophy here has changed over the years.

03:35.935 --> 03:39.420
You keep speaking of Emory and I, and I have a note 
here to ask you. What was the nature of the joint

03:39.921 --> 03:41.863
work with Emory? That is, when a man goes into 
partnership

03:41.883 --> 03:51.876
with a research friend in the time, was this fairly 
common then? Well, I wouldn't say so. I think the

03:56.159 --> 04:09.152
relationship was rather unique because

03:56.159 --> 04:09.152
we were Shepard's two first students in 
oceanography, and he's had some 60 more over the

03:56.159 --> 04:09.152
years. And he more or less took us in as members of 
his family. And we were roommates for three or four

04:20.783 --> 04:32.514
years, as well as working together on this 
project, so we became very closely identified in

04:20.783 --> 04:32.514
doing this work, so I think it was rather an unusual 
circumstance. Was oceanography more personal

04:33.074 --> 04:39.801
then, in the sense of personal relationships, 
than it is now? I would say it was, yes. It was a much

04:43.324 --> 04:49.710
smaller

04:43.324 --> 04:49.710
group of people, and it was people that were In a 
sense, they received

04:50.821 --> 04:57.847
very small compensation for their work. And so 
they were penurious people. And

05:01.410 --> 05:14.702
we were isolated from the social and scientific 
community generally, being in a separate field,

05:01.410 --> 05:14.702
which was not really recognized. And this tended, 
I suppose, to pull people together. Now, in

05:21.213 --> 05:26.538
California, I used to know all the oceanographers 
in the world and all the marine geologists,

05:21.213 --> 05:26.538
certainly. And I used to know all about marine 
geology. I don't anymore. The more old you get, the

05:30.862 --> 05:33.564
less and less you know. But

05:34.245 --> 05:39.549
there was a time when I knew all the marine 
geologists. Well, for example, in California,

05:40.650 --> 05:44.574
this marine geologist finally wanted to come 
along named David Moore. Well, now there are six or

05:45.414 --> 05:49.498
seven marine geologists named Moore in 
California alone. And I keep getting confused

05:49.985 --> 05:55.194
about which Moore is which Moore, but I mean this is 
how the field has expanded. Enormous expansion

05:55.795 --> 06:01.205
where you kind of lose contact, you lose the 
personal contact with people. Well, when a man

06:02.066 --> 06:11.583
like Roger Revell comes to Scripps at almost 
exactly the same time you do, as a matter of fact,

06:02.066 --> 06:11.583
would you automatically know his interest? Would 
you exchange information with him? Would you be

06:15.398 --> 06:16.620
social friends? Oh, yes. Oh, we were very close to 
Roger Vell. And he had started a few years earlier,

06:19.666 --> 06:30.988
but of course, he went to Norway and came back and 
returned at that time. He was working on the

06:31.008 --> 06:32.431
Carnegie results. And so. And he also got involved 
in this project and sailed at sea with this group.

06:41.590 --> 06:47.098
So we were extremely close friends, yes, and it was 
a very close relationship. When you're aboard a

06:47.118 --> 06:56.792
ship and you, for a month at a time, and, you know, 
with six or eight people aboard, you get to know

06:47.118 --> 06:56.792
people very well. Stands to reason.

07:01.779 --> 07:04.643
When you were thinking of oceanography at Scripps 
at this period, Did you tend to all be generalists,

07:04.977 --> 07:16.194
that is, you all discussed the same problems, or 
were you already moving towards a technological

07:04.977 --> 07:16.194
division in oceanography? That is, were you 
primarily interested in geology and someone else

07:16.214 --> 07:27.390
primarily interested, let's say, in marine 
biology, or was there much exchange of

07:16.214 --> 07:27.390
information in terms of problems? These separate 
fields were recognized then. I mean, we

07:31.651 --> 07:41.043
recognized the main branches of oceanography, 
which were marine biology and marine geology. The

07:42.045 --> 07:45.750
geophysics aspects of geology was almost 
undeveloped then. And physical and chemical

07:47.071 --> 07:51.217
oceanography, these divisions were recognized. 
But in those days, we all knew other people's

07:56.564 --> 07:57.505
field. I mean, I felt then I knew a good deal about 
physical oceanography and about chemical

07:57.545 --> 08:03.252
oceanography. I was involved in doing chemical 
analysis, seawater analysis. And I felt then I

08:08.517 --> 08:16.526
knew much more about it than I do now because, well, 
the knowledge was so basic and primitive. And you

08:16.607 --> 08:18.509
did cross fields. And you tended to become a 
generalist rather than a specialist. You have a

08:23.142 --> 08:30.411
phrase in your work, our most productive years, 
you say, in these early years at Scripps. Do you

08:32.774 --> 08:39.281
bring to science sort of a youthful, enthusiastic 
energy that seems to wane over the years? Is that

08:40.403 --> 08:43.406
the nature of scientific research? Well, 
certainly you'll have much more energy in the

08:43.426 --> 08:53.098
early years.

08:55.272 --> 08:59.517
I don't... Did I say they're the most productive 
years somewhere in my publications? Yes, you said

08:59.537 --> 09:03.963
our most productive years, speaking of the years, 
it scripts right up to World War II. I wonder if you

09:04.484 --> 09:09.009
saw... What I'm trying to find out is, did you see a 
break, let's say, with World War II? Do you feel as

09:09.050 --> 09:17.540
if when you begin to move in and around 
oceanography in the Navy that somehow your active

09:09.050 --> 09:17.540
years of research seem to lessen? Your 
publications don't seem to indicate that. No, I

09:19.403 --> 09:20.704
wouldn't say so. I think they're... But I... I 
think you could make more important

09:24.888 --> 09:31.017
contributions, very simple sort of descriptive 
observations in those days than you can now. I

09:31.257 --> 09:38.327
wrote papers in the early years about sea surface 
slicks, for example. And I wrote a paper about the

09:39.709 --> 09:45.457
transparency of the atmosphere in the Antarctic. 
And I wouldn't attempt that nowadays because it's

09:45.537 --> 09:50.004
just too specialized. I feel I don't know anything 
about it. case of Fools Rush In Where Angels Fear to

09:54.183 --> 09:59.408
Tread, but also there was no literature on it, so 
you could contribute something new. And I wrote a

10:00.429 --> 10:07.035
very basic paper on slicks, which I now, I don't 
know enough about it to ever attempt to write

10:00.429 --> 10:07.035
another paper on slicks. And I wrote a paper on deep 
scattering layer, which is acoustic and

10:08.196 --> 10:22.789
biological paper, but the state of knowledge 
wasn't so specialized that you could really make

10:08.196 --> 10:22.789
an important contribution out of your particular 
specialty. But I think at Scripps, the number of

10:24.203 --> 10:32.251
publications we got out was quite impressive, 
considering the small budget. And the papers, I

10:33.352 --> 10:35.574
think, were significant, too. We did the first 
work, for example, on the phosphorite nodules,

10:35.654 --> 10:42.581
which was a very significant discovery. And many, 
many, many very good publications on very small

10:43.382 --> 10:47.286
budgets. So the relationship between the amount 
of money and number of publications or the quality

10:54.072 --> 10:59.519
is very doubtful, whether you have large amounts 
of money or small amounts. You seem to be able to get

11:00.540 --> 11:03.644
some good results. You say the Navy was not 
interested in oceanography in the early 40s, but

11:05.506 --> 11:13.015
the Hydrographic Office is being reorganized 
then. When would you feel as if the Navy committed

11:13.776 --> 11:19.703
itself to oceanography? During World War II. 
During World War II, I think mainly the people at

11:23.772 --> 11:36.871
Woods Hole became, well Scripps too of course, 
through the University of California Division of

11:23.772 --> 11:36.871
Air Research, they both turned to on problems of 
importance to the Navy.

11:39.776 --> 11:48.008
It isn't quite certain the impact they had upon 
wartime results, but certainly it was

11:39.776 --> 11:48.008
significant matter of Often by hindsight, for 
example, the way predictions associated with

11:49.355 --> 12:11.862
amphibious landings, thermal structure 
associated with the back of the thermograph of a

11:49.355 --> 12:11.862
spill house and the submarine, anti-submarine 
warfare, the sediment type, sediment on shelves

11:49.355 --> 12:11.862
associated with the submarine operations and 
resting on the bottom, that sort of thing. It

12:11.902 --> 12:12.803
became very important. The Navy became, became, 
much interest in oceanography during and at the

12:16.523 --> 12:18.946
end of the war. But I think this interest is mainly 
because oceanographers like Ravel infiltrated

12:20.007 --> 12:24.693
the Navy. And when we say the Navy, this is a 
non-personal thing. But when you realize that

12:29.979 --> 12:39.470
there are people in the woodwork like Roger Ravel, 
they provided the catalyst to speak for the Navy. I

12:41.293 --> 12:45.838
should amplify a bit because there are people like 
Marshal Sergeant and Ravel John Lyme and others,

12:46.358 --> 12:56.330
and Bates, who

12:46.358 --> 12:56.330
became part of the Navy operation. And at the end of 
the war, they became sufficiently influential to

12:57.691 --> 13:08.123
get the Navy interested in oceanography. And so 
they established the Office of Naval Research,

13:09.945 --> 13:14.931
which was a very, very critical step And the whole 
philosophy of a military department, military

13:15.839 --> 13:29.622
service sort of sponsoring a science and giving 
out grants and aid was a whole new concept at that

13:15.839 --> 13:29.622
time. And this was successful because of the 
establishment of ONR and its grant policy, which

13:29.822 --> 13:39.518
was unique. among the services, and really the 
whole field of grantsmanship was unique in those

13:40.358 --> 13:45.565
days. Well, what about you in those days? You know 
that you were at Scripps really until about, until

13:50.071 --> 13:57.662
41, you were at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography there. What happened to you between

13:58.042 --> 14:00.325
41 and 45? Well, I,

14:02.388 --> 14:08.897
at University of Illinois, in my When I began my 
junior year, military service was required for

14:09.451 --> 14:14.838
two years, you know, in the ROTC. And I had decided 
not to go on in the advance car, but at the last

14:15.859 --> 14:24.931
moment when I was going through registration, I 
signed up to go into the advance car. And

14:26.593 --> 14:34.243
this was a turning point in my life because it... I 
had no idea I'd ever used this training. Of course,

14:37.770 --> 14:39.712
the clouds of war were already gathering. And so, I 
was a reserve officer in the field artillery. And

14:47.679 --> 14:53.304
so, after Pearl Harbor, even before that, of 
course, when I graduated, I got my PhD. I was really

14:53.384 --> 15:00.130
in effect, I suppose, received a deferment for a 
while so I could finish. That was the summer of 41.

15:05.037 --> 15:17.473
And I came out to Scripps with my new PhD, and I

15:05.037 --> 15:17.473
applied to work for what was then to become the 
University of California Division of War

15:05.037 --> 15:17.473
Research. And Emory did get employed, it did work, 
and so did Shepherd, but the fact that I had this

15:18.935 --> 15:34.234
reserve commission meant that I tried to get into 
war research rather than in as an officer. But I was

15:35.075 --> 15:38.499
called up in August of 41. And

15:38.799 --> 15:49.231
because I had had this flying training and a 
private license at University of Illinois, I was

15:38.799 --> 15:49.231
eventually going into the Air Force. And I 
eventually went through flying school and became

15:49.311 --> 15:52.895
an Air Force officer. I am now a retired lieutenant 
colonel in the Air Force. But so those years, out of

15:58.221 --> 16:03.647
oceanography, spent in the Air Force. Again, 
always trying to use my scientific training as a

16:07.496 --> 16:12.341
PhD, but never successful. Except I finally got 
into photo mapping, which is somehow associated

16:13.122 --> 16:17.266
with geology. But I was there purely as a pilot. I 
never could

16:20.549 --> 16:31.440
get a proper billet in the services to utilize my 
scientific capability. So when the time after the

16:32.669 --> 16:57.647
war and then I received a letter from Eugene LaFond 
who had organized what is now the Navy Electronics

16:32.669 --> 16:57.647
Laboratory and he invited me to join there so I at 
that time people were mustering out of the

16:32.669 --> 16:57.647
services so I left the Air Force and came west to 
join the newly developing Naval Aquatics

16:58.133 --> 17:10.904
Laboratory, and that's a group being formed by 
Eugene LaFond, which was doing oceanographic

16:58.133 --> 17:10.904
work under Navy sponsorship. This is 1946. 1946. 
He invited me to come out, but I guess what the,

17:14.012 --> 17:16.277
really the the carrot and the stick, because he 
suggested I come out. And I was being there

17:20.294 --> 17:28.183
organizing a project high jump, which involved 
going to the Antarctic for three or four months.

17:28.463 --> 17:36.432
And that was a great interest to me, this chance to 
go to the Antarctic under the aegis of the Navy and

17:28.463 --> 17:36.432
Richard Byrd. And so I came out there. And within a 
month's time, I put together what equipment I

17:40.497 --> 17:44.121
could. I was aboard this task group going down to 
the Aeronautic Ocean as the oceanographer on what

17:44.607 --> 17:52.955
was called the Western Task Group. There were 
three separate groups of ships going down, and I

17:52.975 --> 18:00.281
was in charge of the oceanography on the Western 
Group. Myself and a Scripps technician named

18:00.301 --> 18:06.827
Herbert Mann went along with me on that trip. You 
were really going to be attached off and on, if I may

18:07.688 --> 18:12.893
use that word correctly. in San Diego until about 
1963, are you not? Yes, that's right. I was,

18:18.974 --> 18:43.403
I, during my time at NEL, I spent one year in Japan as 
a Fulbright Fellow, and then four years with the

18:18.974 --> 18:43.403
Office of Naval Research in London, and I came back 
again to the Navy, and in 60, but in 63, I

18:18.974 --> 18:43.403
transferred

18:18.974 --> 18:43.403
to to Washington to what was then the Coast and 
Geodetic Survey. Now, as they know, a National

18:49.388 --> 18:52.433
Ocean Survey. I have several questions about this 
period right here. What major projects did you

18:56.460 --> 18:59.224
work on while you were at NEL? You go to work 
primarily upon the structure of ocean floors. Do

19:02.369 --> 19:02.950
you remain? Well,

19:04.793 --> 19:10.723
we made an attempt to work upon the problems of 
marine geology. The climate was not very

19:13.662 --> 19:26.793
favorable there at Naval Aquatic Laboratory 
because they were a hardware-oriented group and

19:13.662 --> 19:26.793
there was a great emphasis upon underwater sound. 
And we were trying to establish a foothold of

19:28.355 --> 19:34.840
oceanography in the Navy. And we did establish a 
Center of Excellence in Oceanography. And we were

19:38.083 --> 19:39.564
a very small part of the lab. We were something like 
In terms of personnel, we were something like two

19:41.230 --> 19:49.918
or three percent of the lab, but we were writing 
more than half the papers, and so we had great

19:41.230 --> 19:49.918
visibility. This really didn't help us because we 
were being criticized all the time for writing for

19:51.019 --> 20:07.455
the scientific literature and scientific 
publications and not for Navy publications and

19:51.019 --> 20:07.455
not for the admirals, and not doing things which 
were considered to be directly applied to Navy

19:51.019 --> 20:07.455
mission. We wrote papers on general science of 
marine geology and oceanography. And many, many

20:14.185 --> 20:21.392
of these efforts were not considered pertinent. 
And we had to hide our proposals under military

20:21.893 --> 20:27.939
adjectives, which were very popular in those 
days. And I must say that the management was sort of

20:29.921 --> 20:33.445
in collusion with us. They went along and they 
realized what was happening. We do the same thing

20:37.029 --> 20:37.970
nowadays. We use the ecological adjectives when 
to explain something we're doing we at any

20:40.732 --> 21:08.190
particular time there's a certain amount of 
something's in vogue and somehow you must couch

20:40.732 --> 21:08.190
your terms and those terms to to remain funded we 
were very poorly funded we had our salaries but

20:40.732 --> 21:08.190
very little more beyond that but it was very 
remarkable when I came back after four years in

20:40.732 --> 21:08.190
London that you say oceanography today is sort of a 
a bright science it suddenly bloomed I guess in

20:40.732 --> 21:08.190
about 58 or so, because then when I returned from 
London to the Navy Lab, I came back, of course, I

21:09.402 --> 21:30.465
came back with the Bathyscaphtra Est, but the 
oceanography in the meantime had become rather a

21:09.402 --> 21:30.465
darling science, if I may use the word, and 
suddenly people that were prior to my departure

21:09.402 --> 21:30.465
were called physicists and acousticians 
suddenly were wearing hats. They were listed as

21:37.103 --> 21:39.186
oceanographers. It suddenly became sort of an 
okay science. And this was quite a remarkable

21:42.270 --> 21:50.701
transition and something which you were aware of 
when you were away for four years and suddenly came

21:42.270 --> 21:50.701
back and saw this new, this sudden new look. What 
took you to the ONR office in London in the 50s? Why

21:55.147 --> 21:56.329
did you choose that? What were the facts behind it? 
Well, uh...

22:05.174 --> 22:34.742
I was

22:05.174 --> 22:34.742
recruited to go there by the ONR staff and I guess 
the idea of going to London, going to a foreign

22:05.174 --> 22:34.742
country and getting involved in something which 
had a good deal of challenge and a promotional

22:05.174 --> 22:34.742
opportunity had certain appeal and it was a very 
good assignment and it was an enjoyable

22:05.174 --> 22:34.742
assignment but I uh i'm not sure it was a wise move in 
my part because it's it was mainly administrative

22:35.397 --> 23:05.337
and it's very difficult to go from research 
scientist into administration and never come

22:35.397 --> 23:05.337
back into research again because you're you 
suddenly lose contact with the field of

22:35.397 --> 23:05.337
literature and you're not up to date and also i 
think doing research involves sort of mental

22:35.397 --> 23:05.337
training it's like It's like when you train for the 
Olympics or something like that, you exercise and

23:06.127 --> 23:11.135
do certain things. When you do research, you think 
along certain lines, and that part of your brain

23:12.037 --> 23:18.968
atrophies if you don't stay with it. You become a 
good administrator, but your ability to do useful

23:19.689 --> 23:31.729
research suddenly, it takes a year or so to get back 
into being a research person, and it's difficult

23:19.689 --> 23:31.729
to switch. What would be your job in the O&R office? 
Our job in O&R was the mission of the O&R office was

23:37.513 --> 24:03.218
to establish liaison and with British and 
European science

23:37.513 --> 24:03.218
mainly more or less in Navy interested fields but 
it was very very broad and my responsibility was

23:37.513 --> 24:03.218
more or less in the oceanography and geophysical 
sciences. And this mission was a very good mission

24:08.098 --> 24:27.332
when ONR was first, ONR London was first created in 
late 40s because all these ties had been broken and

24:08.098 --> 24:27.332
we had no knowledge of what had developed in 
Germany or anywhere in Europe or even in England in

24:08.098 --> 24:27.332
a very immature sort of way. The contacts we have 
nowadays are sort of one to one. But in those days,

24:32.226 --> 24:33.788
you had to go through channels. And it was very 
difficult to learn about developments which had

24:33.848 --> 24:37.452
occurred.

24:40.535 --> 24:50.045
But when I was there, this mission of liaison and 
that level already had become a bit passe because

24:40.535 --> 24:50.045
these bonds were being generated. And people 
were, again, working directly. And people were

24:51.747 --> 24:57.133
traveling overseas, which they getting to 
travel. And so this mission was somewhat passe.

25:05.021 --> 25:07.703
And I realized that. And for that reason, I got 
involved in certain things which really weren't

25:07.723 --> 25:13.309
supposed to be part of the mission. So one of my big 
involvements there was

25:13.509 --> 25:26.563
being involved with the Bathyscaphe Trieste and 
with Picard and with trying to get the Navy

25:13.509 --> 25:26.563
involved in deep submergence, The Navy had an 
interest in not only in ships, of course. The sea

25:35.292 --> 25:36.673
was their environment. But in those days, and I 
think even now, they're spending more money on

25:36.693 --> 25:42.320
aircraft than on ships. And they were spending 
zero money on deep submergence. And they had no

25:51.730 --> 25:54.973
budget at all. They had no precedent. they had had a 
blimp program, a lighter-than-air program,

25:57.104 --> 26:09.364
which was wiped out at the end of the war by the huge 
hurricane here in Florida, which wiped out most of

25:57.104 --> 26:09.364
their blimps down at Richmond Air Force Base. They 
wrapped up the lighter-than-air program, but the

26:10.086 --> 26:18.159
bathyscaphe is simply an underwater, of course, 
is now an underwater blimp.

26:19.882 --> 26:19.922
So My interest, I thought the best thing I could do 
was to get the Navy back into the field of deep

26:22.467 --> 26:35.780
submergence, and the Bathyscaps Trieste 
provided that vehicle to work with Picard and get

26:22.467 --> 26:35.780
small funding. We got $40,000 for his, we weren't, 
the mission of our office was not contracting, but

26:35.800 --> 26:48.913
we did have a few contracts with European 
scientists, and I managed to get these funds

26:35.800 --> 26:48.913
together for Picard. to get the Bathyscaphe 
Trieste back diving, and eventually for the Navy

26:49.889 --> 27:05.603
to buy it and bring it to the U.S. and make the deep 
dive in the Challenger Trench, and this Project

26:49.889 --> 27:05.603
Necton, which Picard and I thought of. And this 
really got the Navy back in deep submergence. The

27:10.367 --> 27:18.214
last time I know this, the Navy's deep submergence 
budget, I think, I don't know, six to eight years

27:10.367 --> 27:18.214
ago, was something like $40 million a year. So it 
went from zero to in the mid-50s to a substantial

27:20.973 --> 27:25.598
program, which it is nowadays. And this was the 
opening wedge of getting Navy involved in deep

27:25.618 --> 27:34.447
submergence, manned deep submergence in DRVs and 
URVs. Do you have any explanation? I have a

27:36.749 --> 27:38.511
question here to ask you about that. Do you have any 
explanation why it took the Navy so long to become

27:38.531 --> 27:44.997
interested in this sort of thing? Well, in any 
large organization,

27:52.445 --> 27:54.427
it's very difficult to establish a precedent. And 
the smaller groups tend to be flexible. But in any

27:59.113 --> 28:02.998
large organization, things are done in a certain 
manner. And any sort of new program, it's

28:03.218 --> 28:10.547
extremely difficult to sell, to organize. So it's 
a matter of basic inertia, I think, of getting

28:10.627 --> 28:19.718
something like the Navy or any large organization 
to move into a new direction.
