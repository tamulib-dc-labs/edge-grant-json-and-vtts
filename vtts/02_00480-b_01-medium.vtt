WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:13.397
Okay, now right after you left England you came 
back and you were assigned as director of the

00:03.001 --> 00:13.397
training of Harledge and Gunnery School in late 
1941.

00:16.001 --> 00:16.823
Tell me about that. What was the objective? Teach 
aerial gunners how to shoot and of course maintain

00:21.890 --> 00:27.439
their weapons.

00:33.747 --> 00:38.093
Were you, did you feel that you were successful 
about doing this?

00:41.558 --> 00:43.241
There are two answers to that. The answer, the 
medium obvious answer is yes, reasonably so. Not

00:48.749 --> 00:50.732
too well, but reasonably so. But to say that this 
effort made a significant contribution in the war

00:51.693 --> 00:58.363
is not so. They didn't get there in time. I see. That 
sounds ridiculous, but just to think that we

01:02.587 --> 01:13.459
started then and were not able to get them into 
combat at the time, but we did the best we could. You

01:13.919 --> 01:17.443
were there on December 7, 1941, I would imagine. 
Yes. What did you think of the Japanese attack on

01:20.126 --> 01:23.590
Pearl Harbor? Were you surprised? Did you have any 
feelings toward it?

01:34.514 --> 01:36.237
Let's put it this way. When I came back from 
England, I of course reported to my commander and

01:38.120 --> 01:44.570
said, we are in the war. The people of the country 
don't know it yet, but we are. And we will be in the

01:50.338 --> 01:57.169
war, Atlantic or Pacific or both, by June of 42. 
This is a certainty. It was in my mind. and made a

02:00.586 --> 02:04.470
deal with him that I'd start this school in 
Harlingen as a goal.

02:07.253 --> 02:17.703
To say that I was surprised that we were in war 
wouldn't be quite accurate because we already

02:07.253 --> 02:17.703
were in the war.

02:19.485 --> 02:30.036
To say that I was surprised that our garrison could 
have been surprised to the extent that they were,

02:19.485 --> 02:30.036
yes, I was.

02:31.231 --> 02:32.953
a blunder in the first consequence.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.818
How long did you stay in Texas? Then you went to 
commander in Laredo as the gunnery school. How

02:41.382 --> 02:44.866
long did you stay before you were finally assigned 
to Europe? Well, until the summer of 43. What

02:49.912 --> 02:58.622
happened again was that by the time we got things 
going, I know we did work our ass off to get it going

02:49.912 --> 02:58.622
as quickly as we could. The commander changed, and 
he came down and invited himself out to my house for

03:00.458 --> 03:12.154
lunch to tell me that I was not going overseas, but I 
was going to Laredo. And I tried to talk my way out of

03:13.616 --> 03:15.679
it, but I couldn't. In other words, you wanted to go 
to the war. That was what I was being paid for.

03:22.128 --> 03:29.098
That's what I'd held my hand up to do, and I felt that 
that was the only thing worthwhile tutors for men.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.825
Now mind you, this didn't apply to everybody. God 
damn it, I had lots of guys, and damn good ones I

03:35.466 --> 03:44.639
might add, who just shucked off their civilian 
clothes and got into uniform to do what they could.

03:46.142 --> 03:49.547
But god damn it, I was a professional. That is what I 
had held up my hand to do many, many years before,

03:51.650 --> 03:58.680
and I felt very strongly about it, and still do as a 
matter of fact.

04:02.153 --> 04:06.759
Because that wasn't the only time it happened.

04:07.420 --> 04:16.371
I got it greased again, and then the commander of 
the training command. I was down at Laredo then,

04:16.391 --> 04:23.881
and I was getting all kinds of cast-off airplanes. 
I'd ask for them. So I'm not blaming anybody for

04:25.643 --> 04:27.225
that. I just, if nobody doesn't want an airplane, 
we got a use for it type of thing. And I got an old

04:31.050 --> 04:33.714
short wind V-26. And the guy that brought it in 
caught a train and left. And there are no data books

04:41.124 --> 04:43.907
with it. I was out there after work toward dark one 
evening trying to figure out how to get it started

04:44.889 --> 04:52.579
so I could test fly it. And this airplane pulled up 
alongside me. I was by myself. And I was in a dirty

04:58.328 --> 05:00.089
flying seat. And it was Tommy Power. He later 
commanded SAC, who was this guy's aide. And so they

05:08.076 --> 05:10.438
got out. And the old man had to go to the Diffie. So 
Tommy said, what the hell are you fixing to do? And I

05:16.143 --> 05:16.744
told him. And he said, no, by God, you're not. 
Anyway, I didn't know this airplane was a true dog.

05:25.735 --> 05:28.158
I was ordered not to fly it anywhere. Nobody else 
could. The bitchin' thing sat on the line there for

05:29.500 --> 05:36.690
a month before we ever got any poop that came 
supposed to come with it. That's not a part of the

05:37.851 --> 05:39.073
story. Yott, who was the commanding general, by 
that time I'd gotten a car to the line, an official

05:40.996 --> 05:49.247
car, and put him in it. And he said, I want to go look 
at your ground range. And I knew goddamn well he

05:51.670 --> 05:53.713
didn't. Things like that didn't interest him. But 
what he wanted to do and what he did was get me off by

05:56.802 --> 06:05.872
myself to tell me again that I wasn't going. And I 
sure didn't like that.

06:10.477 --> 06:13.520
So you didn't get to go until the summer of 1943. 
Yeah, and that was a fluke. And how did that come

06:16.864 --> 06:17.885
about? Because, by God, again, the same thing. I 
organized it.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.370
Well I wasn't there as a combat soldier, I was there 
as an observer. Manning a gun, of course, on the

06:31.531 --> 06:38.858
missions, I believe, but I had wired it up with the 
8th Air Force. I had an old friend there, Fred

06:39.038 --> 06:41.940
Anderson. A classmate of mine from the military 
academy. Hell of a good man. I had arranged it so

06:50.127 --> 06:55.632
that I could stay,

06:56.708 --> 07:07.339
When I shot up, the upshot of it was that we were 
ditched down in the Turanian Sea between Naples

06:56.708 --> 07:07.339
and Sicily. Couldn't make it. We were on a shuttle 
on to Africa. So you were going from where to

07:13.506 --> 07:15.408
Africa? Anyway, when I got in the rubber boat, I 
said, God damn, I may not be back in London in time to

07:15.708 --> 07:24.437
meet the date I had to. see whether or not I was going 
to have to go back before I came back. Anyway, that

07:30.260 --> 07:31.462
didn't work either.

07:34.265 --> 07:35.868
The Germans picked me up the next day. Oh, the 
Germans did? Yeah. I don't think any of this is

07:38.891 --> 07:42.877
humane. So this is 1943? August 17, 1943. 43. 43.

07:50.867 --> 07:54.492
And you were flying as an observer Actually, I was 
flying as a gunner. I was assigned to the theater as

07:57.725 --> 08:13.910
an observer in much the same kind of orders that I'd 
been assigned to the RAF. And as far as the guy I was

08:19.902 --> 08:23.047
working for at the time was concerned, I was coming 
back. But my immediate commander, and I had a

08:23.909 --> 08:37.372
different point of view about it, and he'd already 
arranged, and I knew he had, nobody else did, for my

08:23.909 --> 08:37.372
replacement. And whether this thing that I had 
tried to work out would have worked, I don't know.

08:43.562 --> 08:45.285
Chances are I'd have been killed anyhow. But it 
doesn't matter. Too many years ago, and it doesn't

08:47.787 --> 08:51.751
figure in what you're talking about here. Now, why 
did the plane have to ditch? Well, see, we'd lost

08:56.497 --> 08:59.441
two engines. And we shot up, not badly. Over Italy? 
No, no, over Germany. No, see, what happened...

09:08.452 --> 09:12.317
You see, you said you had to ditch in the 
Mediterranean. Did, but see, the mission was

09:12.798 --> 09:15.441
to... a shuttle run. We would have landed more and 
the remainder of the outfit dead. LeMay was

09:22.239 --> 09:23.620
leading it. And, oh God, I don't see any reason to 
talk about all this.

09:32.209 --> 09:41.679
We got shot up and shot out of the formation and 
managed to get an engine back in and got back in the

09:32.209 --> 09:41.679
formation just in time to bomb and then fell out 
again. Now, we went through the pass, through the

09:45.678 --> 09:57.092
Brenner Pass, because we couldn't make the 
altitude, figuring we were going to get to the

09:45.678 --> 09:57.092
final point, which is Bourne. But we ran out of 
oomph and had to ditch. We finally ended up with one

10:02.719 --> 10:07.866
engine and ditched with one engine. Off Naples? It 
was about midway between Naples and Sicily.

10:15.275 --> 10:15.415
Mm-hmm. I by that time knew we weren't going to make 
it to Bonn, but I did think that we could make it to

10:15.985 --> 10:24.413
Sicily. See, Sicily was in the conflict at the 
time. And in fact, I've been told all kinds of

10:29.718 --> 10:39.868
untruths about what the situation was in Italy, 
but that's not germane. In fact, the whole damn

10:39.888 --> 10:43.191
thing is, I don't see any particular reason I don't 
know why this would figure in a story, but go ahead

10:44.538 --> 10:50.307
and ask the question and I'll answer it. Well then, 
once you were down in the water, how long was it

10:50.327 --> 10:57.478
before the Germans picked you up? They picked us up 
next morning, about probably 9 o'clock in the

10:58.200 --> 11:02.066
morning. Were there any casualties on the plane? 
Oh, not appreciable, no. I got a splinter not

11:11.470 --> 11:12.972
enough to amount to anything. In fact, it didn't 
come out of hand until back in this country. And the

11:18.618 --> 11:24.084
radio man got a slight hit. Actually, a piece hit 
his gun and knocked it out of commission. It wasn't

11:27.287 --> 11:28.729
worth a damn anyway. But that's all. And then when 
you were, so you floated? That's a very, very

11:35.637 --> 11:37.819
sturdy airplane, a B-17. Yeah. And so you were 
floating in life rafts overnight and the next

11:39.837 --> 11:45.764
morning the Germans picked you up. This was a 
pretty heavy

11:46.785 --> 11:53.293
loss raid. When I was taken in finally in 
interrogation I found out why the Germans had the

11:54.695 --> 12:04.326
raid Where they got it, I don't know. I think 
probably off the coding system, but they had it.

12:12.885 --> 12:16.911
And they had it from takeoff points in England and 
tapes. And they had their fighters dispersed down

12:18.514 --> 12:24.002
the whole route. So it was a pretty busy day. And we 
lost quite a few airplanes.

12:32.403 --> 12:35.127
Well, what were your thoughts when the Germans 
picked you up? I thought, oh shit, what else?

12:40.335 --> 12:41.697
Excuse me for the expression.

12:46.004 --> 12:58.343
The thing was that the flying boat came alongside, 
it landed and came alongside, and this guy had in

12:46.004 --> 12:58.343
the front what we call the meat can gun position, 
and I on the boats. We had our lifeboats tied

13:00.921 --> 13:14.994
together and nothing we could do except throw our 
arms overboard and what we had that would sink and

13:00.921 --> 13:14.994
when they said come and she meant that's what we had 
to do. Now where, they flew you to a POW camp? Well

13:22.981 --> 13:28.026
actually I stayed in Naples a while.

13:28.799 --> 13:31.402
got loose in a while, that doesn't matter. And then 
were put on the train, and that took quite a while

13:32.083 --> 13:41.293
because we had a pretty good rage going on. And then 
ended up at Frankfurt, which is where the

13:42.935 --> 13:49.202
interrogation center was. How did the Germans 
treat you? Quite correctly. I have no criticism of

13:56.896 --> 13:59.419
the Germans. I'm a lifelong prejudice against 
Japanese. If I'm aware of it, I won't buy anything

14:03.463 --> 14:08.148
made in Japan. I just detest them. I can't help it. 
And I know it's a prejudice. It's unjustified, but

14:12.573 --> 14:14.315
I've got it. I won't lose it. Not about the Germans. 
What type of questions did the Germans ask you when

14:18.680 --> 14:22.524
they started to interrogate you? Oh, the usual 
ones. The interrogator that I was assigned to, as

14:26.967 --> 14:38.024
it were, was under no illusion about who was going 
to win the war. In fact, none of the German

14:38.044 --> 14:42.391
intelligence officers had any doubts about it.

14:45.516 --> 14:47.659
They knew who was going to win the war. They knew 
that they didn't have the force to oppose us with.

14:50.223 --> 14:50.924
How could you tell? When you got close enough to 
them, they'd tell you. They would actually tell

14:57.224 --> 14:59.387
you that? Oh, yes. Look, they wouldn't tell just 
anybody that.

15:08.841 --> 15:15.710
But,

15:08.841 --> 15:15.710
Jesus, I don't see any use in going through all 
this. See, my assignment as a prisoner was

15:23.296 --> 15:30.084
what you might call counterintelligence, to be in 
charge of escape activities and counter-German

15:23.296 --> 15:30.084
activities. And we had specifically two Germans 
assigned that had no doubt whatsoever about what

15:30.184 --> 15:42.118
the outcome of the war would be. One of them 
survived and was in care packages for a while, and

15:43.680 --> 15:52.611
then we got him a job during the bad times in 
Germany, He's dead now. The other one,

15:55.408 --> 15:57.109
apparently. In other words, did he come to America 
later? No, we got him a job in Germany. He had to stay

16:05.457 --> 16:07.238
there. But he had kinfolks in America. This 
particular one, the one that survived. See, his

16:14.305 --> 16:22.292
uncle owned a bank at Hampton, Virginia, which is 
next door to Langley. And the people at Langley all

16:22.312 --> 16:23.813
knew him. And this man had been there, and he'd 
worked in New York, worked for Hamburg American in

16:24.215 --> 16:29.141
New York for a long time. And he was doing his duty, 
but he wasn't in a doubt whatsoever as to what the

16:30.683 --> 16:37.292
outcome of the war would be. And the other one had 
married one of the Bush heiresses, and she got

16:38.013 --> 16:44.441
tired of him. She divorced him, but he'd lived in 
the United States a long time, too. We tried to find

16:50.409 --> 16:53.513
him, and I actually went through the Russians. We 
got some of them back from the Russians, some of

16:55.096 --> 16:58.920
them that had helped us. But they had no record of 
him, and nobody else did. But he'd been ordered to

17:02.905 --> 17:09.692
Berlin a few days before the collapse. And we 
tracked him that far, and so I suppose he was killed

17:09.712 --> 17:13.776
in Berlin. I don't know. Anyway, we never found 
him.

17:18.741 --> 17:21.424
I'm trying to say in an illustrative way that this 
experience is not like any other experience. And

17:31.414 --> 17:35.158
the general assumptions made about it are 
generally wrong. And what do you mean they're

17:36.519 --> 17:38.481
wrong? Well, in some respects it was much worse 
than people think it was. In other respects it was

17:42.926 --> 17:44.708
much better. Oh, can you explain that? No. But when 
I talk to another POW, he knows exactly what I'm

17:48.852 --> 17:52.255
talking about. Okay, now you said that you were in 
charge of breaking

17:54.395 --> 18:03.088
out of the camps. Look, I don't want to overdo this. 
Most of the time it was very boring. Yeah, I would

18:11.399 --> 18:12.481
think so. I can say this, I was probably Hitler's 
most traveled guest before this was over. I was in

18:18.670 --> 18:20.132
more than one place. But I don't want to make 
anything out of it because it wasn't any big deal.

18:28.950 --> 18:37.061
And the part that I was concerned with was one 
compound. There were others, Americans and

18:38.343 --> 18:40.426
British. When I first got there, they were all 
British. And we went into a British. Later on, the

18:45.854 --> 18:48.557
Germans sorted us out and put the British here. And 
and the Americans there, and then as the Americans

18:50.960 --> 18:56.505
came in and fledged, then they had to build other 
compounds for them. And I was just in this

18:59.188 --> 19:03.852
particular one little place. What was the name of 
it? It was Stalag Luft III, Mittellager.

19:11.319 --> 19:12.780
Mittellager means center camp. And Stalag Luft 
III is the big one that was over in what is now

19:14.642 --> 19:20.848
Poland, which was then east of Germany.

19:25.553 --> 19:33.642
Then they set up another one in a place called 
Barth, which is up on the North Sea, but that was

19:25.553 --> 19:33.642
later. You must remember they were just a whole 
hell of a slew of Americans shot down in that deal.

19:39.409 --> 19:39.729
Sure.

19:46.156 --> 19:51.122
Were you at all fearful that you were going to be 
liberated by the Soviets? I knew we wouldn't.

19:57.926 --> 20:01.151
I made some whiskey on that deal. I bet 
indiscriminately with anybody that bet on what

20:01.632 --> 20:07.600
time we would get out of there and which direction 
we'd go. I knew it because this was my job. A good

20:12.507 --> 20:20.198
many didn't believe it, but this was helpful 
because by the time we had to move, we were prepared

20:12.507 --> 20:20.198
to do it. We had made these guys, most of them 
youngsters, young air-crewed people. We'd

20:25.718 --> 20:32.246
forced them to be prepared to go, and they were 
prepared. And did the Americans liberate to them,

20:32.266 --> 20:36.371
or did the Germans just let you out? No, no, they 
moved us out.

20:42.758 --> 20:47.063
See, it was night, and I had a lot of stuff, 
goddammit.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.047
hidden in various places. I had a gun, for example. 
The idea of a PW having a gun was simply out of the

20:55.610 --> 20:58.693
question. This was a serious misdemeanor. 
Nevertheless, I had it, and ammunition, too. But

21:04.438 --> 21:19.412
in order to secure it, plus a camera and some other 
things that were strictly forbidden, I had taken a

21:04.438 --> 21:19.412
piece of a wall off out of part of this particular 
compound, this particular place. and put it in

21:20.827 --> 21:31.044
there, and then took

21:20.827 --> 21:31.044
water and poured on it, and the ice formed, and it 
was a nice barrier, considerable. Made it look

21:32.366 --> 21:36.232
like it was natural from the rain and so forth. I 
didn't have time to get all that stuff out. I'm

21:41.280 --> 21:43.564
trying to illustrate how it was that we moved. We 
were trying to see our job as more senior people,

21:49.632 --> 21:51.074
was to keep these kids alive. And I don't mean to say 
they were bum kids, they were damn good kids, but

21:51.734 --> 22:03.987
nevertheless they were most of them pretty young 
aircrew guys. It was our job to keep them alive. And

22:06.270 --> 22:17.682
on the whole we did fairly well, but that 
particular occasion, for example, it was dead

22:06.270 --> 22:17.682
night and snowing, and we had to move out pretty 
quick.

22:20.260 --> 22:21.741
And where did the Germans move you? Well, this is a 
long story. But let me tell one illustration of how

22:25.966 --> 22:31.211
it was and stop that. We were walking down a country 
road in the snow, and didn't know where the hell we

22:31.231 --> 22:39.880
were going to get a chance to sleep. But we all had 
these packs that we'd made and were full of stuff

22:40.680 --> 22:47.247
that we'd saved that we needed, food that we could 
save. And warm clothes that we could save. And we'd

22:53.362 --> 22:59.311
inspected all of them, see to it that they had as 
good shoes as we could put together, and that sort

22:53.362 --> 22:59.311
of thing. All right, we were stopped. And here 
comes a tremendous bus the other way, heading

23:03.297 --> 23:11.649
toward the Russian front. And these tremendous 
guys got out, all of them in white snow mountain

23:11.669 --> 23:17.638
clothes. whole thing, hood, everything. Great 
big men and they were certainly interested and

23:21.358 --> 23:27.624
surprised. Guy comes up to the group I was standing 
with and said in a perfect South Carolina accent,

23:27.644 --> 23:37.675
any of you guys got a cigarette?

23:40.537 --> 23:43.120
And before we could react to that, the whistle and 
they all had to run back and get in the bus. In other

23:46.342 --> 23:48.285
words, they were on their way to the Russian front. 
That's the kind of peculiarity that goes with that

23:50.628 --> 23:56.557
situation. Now, we got on down— And were these 
Germans or Americans? Oh, they were Germans.

24:04.808 --> 24:12.499
There were a number of Germans, and I'll say one 
more, who had gone back when Hitler promised them

24:04.808 --> 24:12.499
everything, you know. They went back, second 
generation Germans, some of them, some of them

24:13.475 --> 24:22.543
were just emigres, and they couldn't leave then. 
Once they got back they couldn't get away. One, for

24:26.847 --> 24:40.900
example, this same camp I was talking about,

24:26.847 --> 24:40.900
a shuttle run to a Russian field, I've forgotten 
the name of it, some friends of mine were on the rig,

24:26.847 --> 24:40.900
came over They bombed on the way and they were 
landed in Russia and then they came back to another

24:41.453 --> 24:46.260
target. Well, they came over to camp, you know, 
lots of them. And this man, we called them ferrets

24:49.806 --> 24:56.997
because they just wandered around trying to find 
evidence of escape and whatever they could find.

24:57.618 --> 24:59.701
And they wouldn't speak to you, the guards would. 
Anyhow, this guy looked out the window and says, my

25:01.043 --> 25:06.351
God, this guy is full of the sons of bitches, in 
English. That's exactly what he said. Well, we had

25:08.274 --> 25:09.115
him then. Up to then, we didn't know he spoke a word 
of English. He'd been listening to guys. We warned

25:13.830 --> 25:14.911
him about that. Anyhow, we had him. And it turns out 
that he spent ten years in the United States. No

25:22.381 --> 25:24.343
kidding. He was more American than he was German. 
But that was his job that he was doing. But, to get

25:29.389 --> 25:35.897
back to the question you asked me, we went on to a 
place called... It's just out of Berlin. So in

25:40.027 --> 25:44.892
other words they moved you from East Germany to 
over by Berlin. Yes, I was taken out of the group

25:44.912 --> 25:55.904
along with the senior officer who was a regular 
general and another colonel and a couple other

25:44.912 --> 25:55.904
guys. At this time you were a colonel? Yes, and we 
were taken out and told that there was something

25:57.626 --> 26:09.038
special they wanted us to do and we didn't have any 
option. So the other guys were put on a train and

26:09.963 --> 26:16.533
sent down to another camp down in Bavaria.

26:25.266 --> 26:34.981
Anyway, I ended

26:25.266 --> 26:34.981
up at a place called Lückenwald, which is on the 
other side of Berlin. I went through Berlin that

26:35.001 --> 26:38.586
night, walked through. Was it pretty bombed out? 
It had had a raid that day. It was a nightmare, the

26:45.263 --> 26:57.216
thing, because it was still burning and people 
were still, you could hear some kinds of help and

26:45.263 --> 26:57.216
that sort of thing. Anyway,

26:57.236 --> 27:02.602
I stayed in looking hard. I'd forgotten how long, 
but two were taken out. and sent out through

27:08.384 --> 27:25.160
Switzerland and we demanded that we be put with the 
Americans and join them in Heidelberg and walk

27:08.384 --> 27:25.160
from there down to a place near Munich.

27:28.183 --> 27:31.366
Well, what was this special assignment that the 
Germans had for you? Oh, they were kind of screwed

27:33.248 --> 27:35.910
up. This was told right at the end of the war, and to 
shorten up the story appreciably, those two that

27:36.650 --> 27:49.490
were finally sent on the assignment had orders 
from Himmler. See, Himmler was actually, well

27:51.292 --> 28:02.269
anyway, to go back to Washington with a proposal, 
and one unbid, the other one stayed to take care of

28:02.941 --> 28:04.583
us. See, our job, as I say, was to keep these guys 
alive. And he took this, he only died recently,

28:08.468 --> 28:28.493
with a very dear friend, a close friend of mine, who 
saw it as his job to go into the headquarters of the,

28:08.468 --> 28:28.493
of Eisenhower's headquarters, and see to it that 
we, who were still in the camp, were taken care of

28:29.232 --> 28:33.980
and did a goddamn good job of it, I might add. 
Meanwhile, I was under orders to go with this group

28:34.000 --> 28:42.493
to Mooseburg where we ended up. And is that where 
the American Army liberated you? Yes. It worked

28:48.903 --> 28:50.606
all right. It wasn't exactly pleasant, but it 
wasn't totally bad.

28:57.363 --> 29:00.026
I thought I had lost one man. I was just madder than 
hell about it because I had no option and I left him

29:00.146 --> 29:14.263
in a barn and with word for the Red Cross to pick him 
up if they could. The Red Cross was coming up from

29:14.283 --> 29:19.390
Switzerland at the time. He had no money.

29:25.780 --> 29:30.465
I later heard that he had died.

29:30.485 --> 29:38.774
And see, the object of this kind of exercise is to 
establish some lines of communication. And I had

29:39.935 --> 29:41.958
them by then. And the German told me that, and he 
told it so fluently that I'm sure the guy had died.

29:49.025 --> 29:55.332
Oh, hey, years later, I was in a hurry, admittedly, 
coming out of a an operations office

29:56.037 --> 30:05.048
in Germany trying to get to my airplane before the 
goddamn ice rains immobilized me. This kid

30:05.669 --> 30:08.112
hollered, Hey, Colonel! And I turned around and 
I'm sure as hell it was this kid that I'd left. The

30:12.238 --> 30:17.845
Red Cross had picked him up and got him to a German 
hospital and he survived. So I didn't lose any of

30:17.865 --> 30:18.906
them. How many were you in charge of? I only had 
about 250, and God knows how many there were on the

30:22.290 --> 30:26.193
road.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.118
It was interesting. I bet you it was very 
interesting. What did you do for food? In the first

30:38.123 --> 30:49.753
instance, we had seen to it that those guys 
collected every goddamn bit of food that they

30:38.123 --> 30:49.753
could, that you could preserve, and we made them. 
learn how to preserve food, how to cook it so you

30:51.843 --> 30:55.909
could keep it. And admittedly, we didn't have a 
hell of a lot, but we had enough. It wasn't that way

31:01.978 --> 31:03.561
for everybody.

31:07.186 --> 31:18.964
Now the second go-round,

31:07.186 --> 31:18.964
well, after we had been on the road a little while, 
the Red Cross trucks came up from from Switzerland

31:20.412 --> 31:24.296
and met us and dispersed it. And we actually

31:24.556 --> 31:30.522
fed the Germans out of that. And this sounds 
screwy, but in order to keep us protected from the

31:31.503 --> 31:43.376
SS, we wanted those guards with us. And they had 
nothing to eat except what we gave them. See, this

31:48.323 --> 31:51.728
is asked backwards from the way most people think 
of it. Most people think, well, God Almighty, you

31:51.748 --> 32:02.122
want to get away from the guards, and you do, but the 
circumstances change, and you act accordingly.

32:02.423 --> 32:10.354
And during the final days of the war, you wanted the 
German guards to protect you against the SS. Oh,

32:10.374 --> 32:11.275
this is serious. See, often SS that were moving our 
way into the Redoubt, were largely men who were

32:18.479 --> 32:23.164
from all the countries. They were Flemish, they 
were French, they were Hungarians, they were

32:23.184 --> 32:30.512
everything, who ended up in the German army. They 
didn't have a prayer. They were going to be dead men

32:34.336 --> 32:36.858
when the war was over. And I could tell you about 
things they did, but there's no point in that. We

32:43.085 --> 32:46.208
knew what the situation was.

32:48.010 --> 32:50.373
and we wanted those guards with us. What were the 
guards' feelings toward the SS? It varied, but in

32:56.482 --> 33:07.878
the main, for example, the officer that was in 
charge of the guards that went with us and I became

32:56.482 --> 33:07.878
pretty good friends by the time it was over. He was 
an Austrian and he didn't think anything of this

33:07.918 --> 33:12.325
goddamn war anyhow, but he had to be in it. I'll tell 
you a story about him.

33:18.318 --> 33:32.858
We'd finally got out of the worst part of the 
situation and we were capped and what we did was

33:18.318 --> 33:32.858
send this fella ahead of us on his bicycle to get us a 
place that we could all lie down in. Some village,

33:32.918 --> 33:37.584
anyway, some space that would get under cover. In 
the first instance, you see that? Sleep in the snow

33:39.106 --> 33:40.268
or whatever. And he did a good job on that. We were 
sitting in a farmer's kitchen the men with me that

33:47.275 --> 33:51.081
were more or less in charge of this deal. And we were 
having a pretty good breakfast because the

33:52.282 --> 33:56.949
farmer's wife had given us a couple of eggs apiece. 
They were hard to get. Of course, we'd given her

33:57.910 --> 34:01.295
some soap, which she didn't have. Anyhow, we were 
feeling good. And he came in, and we ribbed him that

34:03.859 --> 34:14.835
he had done so well for us that we thought he ought to 
get a medal. But we didn't know whether he ought to

34:15.558 --> 34:24.049
get the medal from Roosevelt or Hitler because 
he'd done a job for the Germans and he'd done a job

34:15.558 --> 34:24.049
for us too. That was our dilemma and what do you 
think about it? Well, he pulled off his military

34:27.454 --> 34:31.880
cap and threw it on the floor and stomped on it. I 
don't want no medals, no medals. All I want is a

34:33.902 --> 34:35.745
civilian hat. I'll

34:35.785 --> 34:41.953
always remember him. But he was just caught in this 
dilemma then.

34:49.121 --> 34:49.602
What do you mean? Well, he was caught in between 
trying to protect you, and trying to keep you as

34:49.742 --> 34:56.330
prisoners. Exactly where we wanted him. Sure.

35:02.797 --> 35:07.703
In the main, the people that we associated with 
were like that. When you're in the clutch, I mean

35:09.706 --> 35:13.510
when you're really in a serious situation, The one 
thing you could depend on was that they would abide

35:14.823 --> 35:20.793
by the rules. Now, you couldn't depend on that with 
the SS or the Security Service.

35:33.293 --> 35:40.965
Anyway, if you got into their hands, you had to get 
the Luftwaffe to get you out. And they would.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.603
That's where the communications links came in. 
When we found out they had somebody in frame over in

35:45.623 --> 35:55.834
Paris, for example, if we went to our Luftwaffe guy 
and said, that guy's in frame, he didn't ask you how

35:45.623 --> 35:55.834
you knew. He had a police suspicion, I guess, but 
he'd get you out. And once you were in the hands of

36:01.039 --> 36:06.886
the German military, you could depend on their 
abiding by the rules. And that's important. The

36:09.929 --> 36:11.070
Japanese didn't.

36:13.717 --> 36:20.525
Well, when you left then, you were liberated 
probably in May of 1945. I believe it was April.

36:23.628 --> 36:24.269
April 1945. What happened, the force came in and 
just pushed the gates down and the SS shot the

36:24.429 --> 36:36.583
guards. They just shot them with no god damn reason 
except that... Shot the German guards? They

36:42.218 --> 36:44.862
machine gunned the guard house. This sounds well, 
I'll tell it. This is just before the Americans

36:52.653 --> 36:55.077
came in. Two things happened. The SS had some 
prisoners of their own, some of these poor

36:57.100 --> 37:05.171
bastards, and God, you wouldn't believe what they 
looked like. Skinny? They were all kinds, but they

37:08.035 --> 37:11.280
were Germans as well. people of this country I 
don't think realize about Hitler's regime is they

37:11.598 --> 37:17.685
didn't just do this to Jews. They did this to 
anybody that was against them. Anyway, they shot

37:21.889 --> 37:23.131
some of them. They lined them up and shot one here 
and one here and just left them lie there. And they

37:27.195 --> 37:40.710
came by the guard house, the guard men's house, 
little barrack-like building, hardly any bigger

37:27.195 --> 37:40.710
than these two rooms, and told the guards they were 
going down to the redoubt and they said, The guard

37:41.129 --> 37:43.331
said, no, we're going to stay here with the 
Americans. So by God, they machine gunned the

37:44.092 --> 37:47.816
house and killed several of them. Didn't kill them 
all, but killed three or four of them. Anyway,

37:52.320 --> 37:59.328
shortly after that, the Americans came in with 
weapons carriers and tanks and broke down the

37:52.320 --> 37:59.328
gates. And the SS had left? Yes. These people were 
the kind of people I told you they were. house

38:09.715 --> 38:11.637
landers that had no future. When they went home, 
they were dead, and they knew it.

38:18.543 --> 38:20.425
So they acted that way. And so then the Americans 
came in, did they give you any kind of hospital care

38:21.186 --> 38:29.454
or medical treatment or food, or how did they? 
Look, they fed us as best they could. When I first

38:35.420 --> 38:37.782
got in the cab, This was a, I guess you'd say it was a 
surge of prisoners. The summer of 43 it was a pretty

38:42.873 --> 38:50.265
big scale operation for the 8th Air Force, and they 
got a lot of them in. The Germans weren't prepared

38:50.285 --> 38:51.587
for them. We went in with the British, and the 
British were getting, by that time, were getting

38:51.607 --> 39:03.385
food, not a hell of a lot, but some, through the Red 
Cross, Britain, in through Sweden, down to

38:51.607 --> 39:03.385
Israel. So the British shared with us. They shared 
everything. And of course, when things got tight

39:07.613 --> 39:10.777
for them, we shared the family. It was a two-way 
street. But the Germans didn't give us much.

39:18.246 --> 39:20.008
Later, it was a little better. It was not good. But 
they did give us stuff. And I'd say that on balance,

39:28.799 --> 39:33.925
we ate about half off the Americans and half off the 
Germans, something like that. Well, how'd you get

39:39.806 --> 39:41.188
your half? Was this Red Cross food? Oh, well, they 
were, again, a part of the German mystique. When it

39:48.136 --> 39:53.303
was a Red Cross authorized delivery, by God, you 
got it. They wouldn't consider taking any of it off

39:55.346 --> 40:01.313
for themselves. That's just the way they are, or 
were, with us. Let me illustrate what I mean. I told

40:09.968 --> 40:19.560
you I was taking them to this special place just out 
of Berlin, and I'd quit smoking long before

40:09.968 --> 40:19.560
because I don't smoke now at all, but I did then. It 
wasn't worth it. Besides, it's great trading

40:21.923 --> 40:23.705
material. So my wife had arranged to send through 
the Red Cross tobacco. Well, this place that we

40:30.313 --> 40:31.975
left was you might imagine, utter chaos. And how 
the British man responsible for Red Cross knew

40:35.795 --> 40:43.466
that I was in this particular place, I was, I'm 
damned if I know. But one day he came in, two big

40:44.547 --> 40:51.357
packs of pipe tobacco addressed to me. It had been 
stopped because it couldn't be delivered,

40:51.377 --> 40:54.622
obviously, where it had been. The Russians were 
there by then, I guess. But there it was, and you

40:58.330 --> 41:02.975
recognized the name, and the Germans weren't 
about to take it, so they gave it to him. Of course, I

41:02.995 --> 41:07.541
traded it for food, and warm clothes. Well, hell, 
it doesn't interest me a goddamn bit, but you ask

41:07.561 --> 41:16.291
the question, and I'll answer it. Well, what about 
when you were on the East, in East Germany, before

41:16.311 --> 41:26.262
you left that area? Were the Germans fearful of the 
Russian advance? Oh, look, the Germans were under

41:30.675 --> 41:37.322
no illusion whatsoever about the Russians. We 
were. I wasn't because I had better information.

41:42.468 --> 41:42.528
No.

41:45.891 --> 41:50.356
No, they were under no illusion about it at all. And 
it proved out. I had some friends that were caught

41:54.288 --> 42:00.097
in the mess when the Russians came in and took the 
country, and they were pretty bad. I mean, they

42:01.158 --> 42:04.403
raped women right out on the street, things like 
that. And I'm not saying I saw this, but friends of

42:04.463 --> 42:15.039
mine who did see it and would have no reason 
whatsoever to lie about it, they just tell me what

42:04.463 --> 42:15.039
they saw and what happened, and it was pretty bad.

42:17.884 --> 42:20.768
Now, after our Tell me a little bit about the 
relationships between the British prisoners of

42:21.828 --> 42:28.758
war and the American prisoners of war. You did 
mention that you shared food. Did you share

42:31.683 --> 42:33.085
command too? I mean, as you as an American colonel, 
were you in charge of British troops or? Oh no,

42:38.052 --> 42:50.350
once we found out what the score was we tried to keep 
this thing as separate as we could and we did pretty

42:38.052 --> 42:50.350
good, but it isn't as though there weren't some 
peculiar instances. Let me tell you one. Jesus,

42:54.085 --> 42:55.346
I'm talking too much. I owned a guard all right, but 
went into a railroad station and the yards had been

42:58.049 --> 43:17.890
bombed and around they'd been bombed and all the 
people were down in what you might call the

42:58.049 --> 43:17.890
basement of the railroad station and it was full of 
sewage. women and children and what not, but

43:19.405 --> 43:30.018
nevertheless that's where they, what they call an 
abort is a biffy, and we had to use it. And there was a

43:30.038 --> 43:43.514
British group captain, correspondents to 
Craylon, and this was a lousy circumstance in

43:30.038 --> 43:43.514
which all you had to do was just do it, do something, 
and there was a pair of the guys off to go. But he took

43:45.857 --> 43:48.400
charge just as though he were

43:51.468 --> 43:59.200
guiding the Battle of Britain

43:51.468 --> 43:59.200
in issued orders, sternly and all that. Well, we 
just laughed at him. But that's the kind of thing

44:01.263 --> 44:03.426
that can happen.

44:06.912 --> 44:12.280
Some people resented it more than others, and some 
British resented it more than others, I'm sure.

44:13.342 --> 44:19.551

among those people.

44:23.730 --> 44:31.918
returning soldier. How did the American people 
treat you? Were you treated as a hero? I wasn't a

44:39.005 --> 44:41.147
hero, Christ no. Here's what happened. I was 
first, old friends did this, they knew where I was,

44:42.868 --> 44:50.736
and another guy too. And they sent after us. They 
sent an airplane as far as they could go and loaded

44:53.502 --> 44:57.667
the jeep out of them and came and got us. They knew 
what we were doing and had been doing. So I ended up

45:02.913 --> 45:06.276
in Rice. That's where the command headquarters 
was then. Because the object was to see to it, for

45:09.580 --> 45:15.206
example, we had a sergeant's camp. I'd been to it 
down in Austria. It looked kind of bad for them. We
