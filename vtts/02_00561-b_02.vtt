WEBVTT

00:14.527 --> 00:18.191
So after you worked in industry for a couple of 
years, Mr. Green? Yes. So then were you free to do

00:19.873 --> 00:22.075
what you wanted? Yes. I see. And you were free to 
join the Communist Party overtly? Yes. I see. Were

00:33.867 --> 00:42.576
there any times, like in the 60s, where you felt the 
country was more receptive or warmer? Where there

00:43.872 --> 01:09.215
was hope, maybe.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.697
Well, it's a tremendous proof that it has to be a 
first world experience. Yeah. A piece of... Yeah.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.238
And, of course, that goes on back to tremendous... 
Yes. Well, I think it inspired a lot of people,

01:12.358 --> 01:13.339
right? Yeah.

01:25.004 --> 01:31.354
And in so doing, being tolerant for minorities, 
the communists were more accepted?

01:39.829 --> 01:40.069
Yeah.

01:43.593 --> 02:08.356
Although,

01:43.593 --> 02:08.356
the McCartney period was something of a watershed 
for his life. Two aspects. First, in regard to the

02:08.637 --> 02:09.497
country's ideology. Second, in regard to the 
country's ideology. In regard to the ideology,

02:10.418 --> 02:12.200
during the McCartney period, there were periods 
of oppression. Yes.

02:29.543 --> 02:43.937
Yeah.

02:43.957 --> 02:59.173
Or intolerance for any other ideology.

02:59.193 --> 02:59.293
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

03:03.310 --> 03:04.652
Yeah. Don't you think... I get the impression... I 
used to live in Britain, and I lived in Canada, and

03:06.054 --> 03:11.080
I've been in the States six years now. And I think 
part of it's got to do with lack of education. We

03:15.687 --> 03:20.213
were... Well, in Britain and in Canada, we were... 
They were a lot more open-minded about teaching

03:20.233 --> 03:23.717
other ideologies. It wasn't the good versus the 
bad. It was just different ideologies. And the

03:28.824 --> 03:30.647
student... When I was in high school, at least... I 
didn't find... They taught nothing about

03:34.872 --> 03:37.015
communism. And the government class we had were 
taught, American democracy, this is it. And I

03:43.887 --> 03:45.390
don't know.

03:48.976 --> 03:55.668
Yeah,

03:48.976 --> 03:55.668
well, of course, that is another thing. Uh-huh. 
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

04:03.335 --> 04:06.865
Yeah.

04:40.223 --> 04:45.231
Yeah.

04:50.841 --> 04:54.306
Uh-huh.

04:54.326 --> 04:59.355
Uh-huh.

04:59.375 --> 04:59.515
Uh-huh.

05:10.160 --> 05:33.858
Uh-huh.

05:33.878 --> 05:33.978
Yeah. Oh.

05:55.823 --> 06:22.985
Uh-huh.

06:23.005 --> 06:23.105
Yeah. Uh-huh. Over $300

06:24.072 --> 06:42.279
billion. $300 billion, yes. Now, we've had 
inflation, of course, because it's related to it.

06:44.963 --> 06:46.866
In 1935, the average wage of something of a worker 
was something like $50 a week. Yeah. Now, if you

06:47.667 --> 06:49.510
multiply that 300 times, the average wage today 
would be $15,000 a week. Yeah, yeah. Do you know how

06:49.770 --> 06:50.451
ludicrous that is? Everybody wants $15,000 a 
week. So you

06:51.224 --> 06:57.055
can see that the inflation of the military has far 
surpassed any. Yeah. Well, military has become a

06:57.195 --> 07:01.323
number one priority, unfortunately. That's

07:01.343 --> 07:06.513
right. Yeah. And also, we've reached a point now 
where so much has been targeted to the military,

07:06.654 --> 07:08.457
where

07:16.351 --> 07:39.675
Uh-huh.

07:47.637 --> 08:05.454
Now,

07:47.637 --> 08:05.454
also, when the

07:47.637 --> 08:05.454
war ended, we were the preeminent export nation in 
the world. No one could compete with us. If anyone

08:06.074 --> 08:08.256
mentioned that Arthur Beale, you always thought 
of Detroit. But today, that's no longer the case.

08:11.159 --> 08:15.383
What is happening today is we have a budget that 
just counts, mainly because of what we're

08:11.159 --> 08:15.383
spending on the military. We

08:15.751 --> 08:40.942
also have a

08:15.751 --> 08:40.942
deficit of world trade, something like $125 
billion a year short of foreign trade. Yes. And the

08:41.062 --> 08:43.445
only two things we excel in now in export is first, 
agricultural growth of 70 billion. Now all that

08:43.465 --> 08:43.986
has happened. all

08:44.422 --> 09:07.105
that impressed

08:44.422 --> 09:07.105
the one thing, the attainment of world supremacy. 
Yeah. Yeah. Or diplomacy. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. At

09:08.046 --> 09:08.607
one point, after the war, Senator

09:09.008 --> 09:18.343
Vandenberg.

09:22.694 --> 09:37.087
Yeah.

09:37.107 --> 09:39.893
Yeah. Yeah.

09:50.237 --> 09:55.450
Yeah.

09:55.470 --> 09:55.570
Yeah. Do

09:56.242 --> 10:20.317
you think we're suffering because of the Reagan 
administration and, say, if things change in the

09:56.242 --> 10:20.317
next election, or is it just a current and it really 
doesn't matter who's in power?

10:20.337 --> 10:22.580
Yeah. In other words, the dominant sections of 
American capitalism And

10:24.203 --> 10:50.033
the next group, combined with the military, who 
thought they had at that time, they had the deep

10:24.203 --> 10:50.033
weapon that could decide issues, namely the atom 
bomb. I remember that when our trial began, the

10:50.053 --> 10:51.975
United States was the only country with the atom 
bomb. Yes. Now there's a threat. Yeah. They still

10:52.656 --> 10:53.517
talked about the Russian threat. Yeah. What has

10:55.928 --> 11:04.180
happened is a combination. It's made for it. Yes, 
the Reagan administration has taken it to its

11:04.561 --> 11:08.526
extreme. But it goes deeper than the Reagan 
administration. So what's the outlook for the

11:09.728 --> 11:11.110
future? Is it pessimistic? No, I don't think it's 
pessimistic. I believe that we are approaching a

11:18.441 --> 11:21.345
period when things are going to change. First,

11:22.388 --> 11:43.993
Reagan has had a lot of luck in terms of the economy. 
And I think the economy is going to have a downturn,

11:44.013 --> 11:46.015
and then things will get to face up to reality. That 
the technological, scientific changes that are

11:46.035 --> 11:48.377
taking place in production are going to create a 
kind of problem. Furthermore, that the country

11:48.398 --> 11:50.600
cannot completely recover the kind of deficit 
that it has in the federal budget. It's

11:50.620 --> 11:50.940
impossible. Nor can it solve that problem by 
taking more from those who have less. Yeah.

12:18.955 --> 12:22.500
Ability,

12:18.955 --> 12:22.500
yeah. So

12:23.476 --> 12:46.406
I think that at this point, the

12:23.476 --> 12:46.406
great majority of the people want peace. And I 
don't think too much happened in Geneva. No, I

12:47.367 --> 12:47.807
don't either. It's important nonetheless. But at 
least there was a similar change between the two

12:48.388 --> 12:49.650
powers. And it's interesting that the tremendous 
response that the Congress gave to the president,

12:49.670 --> 12:52.133
Democrats and Republicans alike, Because

12:52.433 --> 13:16.490
generally, people feel that this offers a hope of 
some way of solving the crisis that we're getting

12:52.433 --> 13:16.490
into more deeply all the time, and the danger of a 
clear war that may destroy all life on Earth. And I

13:16.510 --> 13:17.812
think that that is the significance of what 
happened there. Although the fight is still ahead

13:17.832 --> 13:21.377
of us, we're turning that into some kind of 
meaningful change, putting the army race,

13:17.832 --> 13:21.377
burying it where it belongs to the barrier to being 
free. Yes. Yeah. No, thank you. Well, can I get your

13:25.916 --> 13:27.579
address? I'd like to send you something.

13:42.523 --> 13:42.623
Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. That's very 
kind of you.

13:51.986 --> 14:00.539
Well, I'm graduating, but I'm quite certain that 
other students and my professor would be

13:51.986 --> 14:00.539
interested in having you come speak.

14:04.165 --> 14:06.809
Yeah. Uh-huh. Ah, OK. 10111?

14:18.630 --> 14:21.133
Okay, okay. I was living, I spent some time with a 
friend who lives off West 22nd and Park this

14:22.235 --> 14:29.246
summer. That was nice.

14:35.655 --> 14:36.717
Well, thank you very much. Yes, I do, by heart now. 
Thank you very much, and the best of luck to you, and

14:40.872 --> 14:45.532
I hope your wife ends up getting better. Thank you 
very much. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.
