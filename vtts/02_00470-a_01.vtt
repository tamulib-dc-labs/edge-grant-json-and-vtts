WEBVTT

00:01.027 --> 00:02.630
convenient at that time you were saying? Reserve 
units were sort of few and far between and they had

00:03.912 --> 00:27.709
not been re-established and there were no 
armories really and the program was really in the

00:03.912 --> 00:27.709
grassroots and there were some geographical 
divisions in other words if you lived in one county

00:03.912 --> 00:27.709
you had to go a certain direction to to meet there 
were, I think they called them

00:28.398 --> 00:35.585
reserve areas or some such thing. I lived in Hearn, 
and the closest place that I could find to

00:35.905 --> 00:45.395
participate in the reserve was in Temple, which 
was 65 miles away. So there were four of us that

00:46.376 --> 00:52.982
pulled our automobile and started driving back 
and forth to Temple. And I think we met twice a month

00:54.263 --> 00:58.067
there, not on a real regular scale, no pay, just met 
for points and comradeship and just to keep in on

00:58.199 --> 01:08.793
the know. We'd have speakers that had come that 
were Army people, and we'd have people that knew of

01:09.734 --> 01:20.188
the development in the military. It really was not 
a real organized type outfit. And there was every

01:25.992 --> 01:28.355
branch in the world in it. Oh, really? They called 
it a composite regiment. You just came, and

01:33.182 --> 01:44.438
somebody was designated the commander, and he 
probably got a few little administrative pays,

01:33.182 --> 01:44.438
but we got on the points. Well, what'd you do in it? 
And this is from 1946 to 1951 then? That's right.

01:49.425 --> 01:51.569
And what was your duty there? We'd be assigned 
to... come up with a program for the whole group.

01:59.814 --> 02:06.641
Maybe mine might be on building a highway bridge or 
something along my line. And then we studied, we

02:07.622 --> 02:16.191
took advantage of a lot of the correspondence 
courses that the Army had. And we utilized those to

02:16.271 --> 02:22.217
just enhance our knowledge and whatnot. But it 
really was not Not really what you'd call anything

02:23.975 --> 02:28.540
real constructive branch-wise. It really was 
just a sort of a holding unit, just to keep people

02:28.620 --> 02:33.546
together. And we did have the opportunity to go to 
summer camp a couple of times. Did you get paid for

02:39.413 --> 02:40.334
that? Yes, we did. We were on active duty then. I 
mean, just like any other two weeks. But you didn't

02:45.199 --> 02:48.804
go two weeks every summer because it was so 
disorganized. You just went a couple of times in

02:48.824 --> 02:51.146
those five years. I think I only went two times. 
Then I think I went one time as a casual. I just got an

02:56.771 --> 03:03.060
opportunity to be called and went up to Fort Hood 
and served with an engineer battalion. So I may

03:03.080 --> 03:11.571
have gone three times, but two or three, it was not 
anything regular like it is now.

03:11.592 --> 03:17.640
All this time, you were part of the reserve unit 
attached to the Corps of Engineers, right? I was a

03:18.008 --> 03:19.671
Corps of Engineer officer. Okay. But we were under 
what was called Texas Military District, which

03:20.572 --> 03:29.207
headquartered in Austin, and they administered 
all the reserves. It didn't matter whether you

03:29.307 --> 03:32.332
were engineer, artillery, infantry. It was sort 
of a control headquarters. But it's called Texas

03:36.118 --> 03:38.122
Military District. Okay. They maintained 
records. Right. Now, as an engineering officer,

03:41.971 --> 03:55.647
what relation did you have, or what relationship 
did you have, your reserve unit have, with the

03:41.971 --> 03:55.647
Corps of Engineers who built Somerville Dam? 
None. None? Not at that time. Ever? Did you ever? We

04:00.753 --> 04:04.637
did after we got in this engineer brigade, yes. And 
when did you erect the engineering brigade? I got

04:07.790 --> 04:11.234
into it in 51 or 52, I guess. 51 through 65, okay. 
Right, okay. Okay. That's when they finally broke

04:14.639 --> 04:27.155
down these county lines and allowed me to come from 
Roberson County to Brazos County and let me join

04:14.639 --> 04:27.155
this 420th Engineer Brigade. Right. And that's 
what I'd been wanting to do for, well, it had been in

04:27.495 --> 04:32.281
being for a couple of years. But why did they erect 
the 420th? Spencer Buchanan, who is a consultant

04:37.574 --> 04:57.456
here, envisioned the opportunity to come up with 
an engineer unit and utilize a lot of engineer

04:37.574 --> 04:57.456
reserve officers to start building the reserve 
program in this area. And he got them together and

04:58.448 --> 05:04.977
got the designation and started the unit. It was 
his doings, basically, just in order to promote

05:04.997 --> 05:12.326
the reserve program. And the Army Reserve went 
along with this. Oh, yeah. I think by that time,

05:18.194 --> 05:22.920
they were probably beginning to... have funds and 
uh places and Korean war just yeah right around the

05:23.137 --> 05:51.085
corner and it it started as a I believe as an 
engineer group or battalion battalion or group

05:23.137 --> 05:51.085
and subsequently got designated as a brigade so he 
commanded it for its initial

05:23.137 --> 05:51.085
birth and infancy and kicked it off the ground and 
Most of the officers in it were engineer officers.

05:55.298 --> 06:01.204
And he built a good program and started it very 
constructively. And I went with it the first time I

06:02.286 --> 06:05.970
went to summer camp was in 1952. They did not go, I 
believe, prior to my going as a group, as a brigade.

06:13.340 --> 06:17.086
So the first time it went to summer camp was 1952. We 
went up to Mineral Wells, up to Walters Air Force

06:18.508 --> 06:37.339
Base, and we built roads and little landing strips 
and

06:18.508 --> 06:37.339
oil tank pads and, you know, the gamut. He was a 
stickler for getting up there and building

06:37.707 --> 06:43.934
something that you could see and use. He was sort of 
oriented toward the Air Force. In fact, we were at

06:50.062 --> 06:55.929
one time called Air Force Engineer Brigade. So it 
was sort of designated toward the Air Force. But we

07:01.796 --> 07:03.698
began to do things that were were constructive and 
instructive, and it grew in a pretty good hurry. It

07:12.305 --> 07:13.186
blossomed. Okay, now let's get back to that 
question. What relations do they have with the

07:15.950 --> 07:20.075
Corps of Engineers since the early 1950s? Okay, we 
would work, we would go to summer camp, and a lot of

07:21.257 --> 07:33.853
the work we did was with the civilian Corps of 
Engineers at a Class I installation, like Walters

07:34.188 --> 07:51.763
Air Force Base has a, their engineer was called a 
director of installations or some such thing, but

07:34.188 --> 07:51.763
he was part of the engineering aspect of that 
installation. And he'd have certain chores that

07:52.584 --> 08:02.693
he was going to do with his own forces or contract 
it, and we'd use our engineer people, and he'd

07:52.584 --> 08:02.693
furnish materials. Subsequent to that, we did 
some jobs as time went along with the actual Corps

08:03.567 --> 08:21.088
of Engineers, things that they had that they were 
going to have done and pay for, and we'd do it in

08:03.567 --> 08:21.088
coordination with them to utilize. You'd do it on 
like a summer camp basis? That's right. That's

08:25.794 --> 08:26.134
right. What kind of projects? I mean, like did you 
work out at Somerville or did you? No, we never did

08:30.059 --> 08:32.562
work at Somerville, but we worked at, Oh, we worked 
at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, Fort Chaffee, Arkansas,

08:33.335 --> 08:53.757
Fort Polk, Louisiana, Bullis, Camp Bullis, Fort 
Sam Houston, Fort Bliss.

08:56.909 --> 09:01.814
up at Red River Arsenal in Texarkana. Anywhere 
there was an installation that we could go and do

09:01.834 --> 09:15.088
work that was constructive to us, we were very 
insistent that we not make work type things. Build

09:15.669 --> 09:17.731
something that they were going to tear down. Sure, 
right. You can really tear a man's morale up to have

09:18.792 --> 09:26.781
him go out and labor and sweat and build something 
that he knows is going to serve no purpose

09:27.419 --> 09:30.202
whatsoever. And one of the prime concerns that I 
had as a brigade commander was, if at all possible,

09:31.944 --> 09:52.688
never build anything that's going to be torn up 
unless it was made to be torn up, something to be

09:31.944 --> 09:52.688
able to explode or blow up or something like that. 
We always wanted to build something that was going

09:52.988 --> 09:56.312
to be utilized or have some utility.

10:01.146 --> 10:23.818
We, the Corps of Engineers, I'm talking about 
reserve units or engineer units, in my opinion had

10:01.146 --> 10:23.818
a head and shoulders start on a lot of the other type 
of military organizations, infantry per se,

10:01.146 --> 10:23.818
artillery, the other people because we could 
teach people skills that they could use to make a

10:24.153 --> 10:29.119
living at. Now, an infantryman, he's a very 
important part of the war, but you can take an

10:29.159 --> 10:41.435
infantryman out and nothing that he learns at 
summer camp can he make a nickel with. But we taught

10:42.216 --> 10:50.306
bulldozer operators, motor grader operators, 
crane operators, welders, divers. You know, just

10:54.055 --> 11:23.370
thousands of skills and many of those people got 
civilian jobs on the strength of learning it in the

10:54.055 --> 11:23.370
reserve program and it was real easy back in the 
times when it was hard to get people enlisting in

10:54.055 --> 11:23.370
reserve units we didn't have much trouble because 
we had a program that could pay them dollars and

10:54.055 --> 11:23.370
cents and it just made a big difference I had never 
thought of that aspect of it. And you could tell a

11:28.223 --> 11:40.028
man when he came out to recruit him that he could 
teach him skills that he could make a living with.

11:41.832 --> 11:43.435
Pretty interesting to him. How many reserve 
engineering brigades are there in Texas? Just

11:49.397 --> 11:49.938
one. That's what I thought. There are four in the 
United States. Oh, that's all. That's

11:54.305 --> 11:56.649
fascinating. Where are the other three? Well, 
there was one. Now, there were four. Now, two of

12:05.343 --> 12:06.806
them have subsequent. There were four when? 1968? 
Well, when I was in the reserve. Okay. Okay. There

12:11.427 --> 12:19.758
were four, but two of them have been re-designated 
as engineer commands, they call it, and they're

12:11.427 --> 12:19.758
commanded by a two-star general. And we were not 
fortunate enough to get one of those. Why do they

12:24.825 --> 12:27.749
need a two-star general? Why were they 
re-designated? I'm not real sure. The concept of

12:34.398 --> 12:39.966
it was that they were going to give them broader 
responsibilities in the event of emergencies,

12:40.857 --> 12:59.062
and they were going to handle a broader area of 
engineer responsibilities, less of a direct

12:40.857 --> 12:59.062
responsibility like we had of actually 
commanding the units. They would have an umbrella

12:59.123 --> 13:05.211
type responsibility, like there was one in 
Vietnam that that was responsible to the theater

13:05.933 --> 13:13.041
commander for all engineer activities in 
Vietnam. And it's just a bigger responsibility.

13:17.025 --> 13:23.112
So they re-designated two of them as engineer 
commands and then left two of them as engineer

13:17.025 --> 13:23.112
brigades. Now, there's one in Chicago, one in New 
York, one in

13:23.132 --> 13:34.945
Vicksburg, and one in Brown, Texas, Vicksburg, 
Mississippi. Why Vicksburg? The Waterways

13:38.403 --> 13:40.226
Experiment Station. Now, that was one that was 
designated as a command, and the one in Chicago was

13:40.546 --> 13:48.779
designated as a command. Now, the one in 
Vicksburg, and I think the reason it was activated

13:50.041 --> 14:01.759
in the first place was they've got a big waterway 
experiment station over there, belongs to the

14:02.836 --> 14:07.322
Corps of Engineers, and they've got lots of Corps 
of Engineer officers there. And I'm sure that's

14:07.342 --> 14:12.209
the reason it was originally organized like this 
one was here. But why the two were chosen for two

14:14.311 --> 14:27.409
stars, I think it was politics, Senator Strom 
Thurmond

14:29.363 --> 14:33.930
Mississippi, or wherever you want to know that. 
Who was from Mississippi? Anyhow, one of the big

14:36.673 --> 14:40.980
armed forces man was... Eastman, isn't he? I don't 
remember, but anyhow, we always thought that

14:41.320 --> 14:50.073
there was a lot of politics in it, because we 
thought we had about as good a run as anybody. Well,

14:50.093 --> 14:51.074
that's something, though. There's four of them in 
the country, and we're one of them. There's one in

14:55.460 --> 14:58.645
Germany, and... It's under Seventh Army. And then 
there was one in Vietnam. But that's on active

15:04.784 --> 15:06.126
duty, yeah. That's correct. But full reserve. 
Yeah,

15:10.090 --> 15:18.200
that was a compliment to Brian to have one, and just 
four in the States. Certainly does seem like it to

15:19.822 --> 15:21.284
me. OK, let's talk a little bit about your career. 
In December of 1946, you were promoted to major.

15:36.728 --> 15:42.633
Then your next promotion didn't come for 14 years 
until 1960. Why is that? Well,

15:44.235 --> 15:50.460
there just was not an opening. We had a pretty 
static outfit. People got in and they didn't get

15:53.703 --> 15:58.787
out much. But it just was not an opening. I used to 
hoorah that I was the oldest major in the United

16:02.776 --> 16:09.643
States Army Reserve. But the opening just didn't 
occur. The fellow got in a position where he stayed

16:15.830 --> 16:18.093
with it. So, you know, I just never got the 
opportunity. Well, did you ever get frustrated

16:21.516 --> 16:24.399
about that? Oh, not really. So you never 
considered getting out of the resource because

16:26.273 --> 16:30.658
they didn't promote you? No, it was a real 
satisfying job. I had several jobs during that

16:34.303 --> 16:47.519
time, principally the brigade engineer, but the 
fellow that was above me just stayed and stayed,

16:34.303 --> 16:47.519
and so it just didn't come off. I was under the 
impression that after you went up for a rank, then

16:49.542 --> 16:55.369
you came under review. Uh, and after you've been 
reviewed a couple of times, then they might not let

16:55.872 --> 17:04.202
you stay in the... That didn't happen in the 
reserve, or didn't over those years. It did not

17:04.222 --> 17:05.323
happen, no. That was not part of the, part of the 
program. It is now, though, isn't it? I think

17:09.949 --> 17:10.790
that's right. I think that's correct, and it 
probably should be. Uh, in fact, I think now, uh,

17:15.275 --> 17:25.828
they limit certain positions to maybe three years 
or five years or some such thing. Fortunately for

17:26.855 --> 17:33.924
me, they didn't at that time, because I might have 
dropped out of the program of necessity. Sure,

17:34.184 --> 17:34.845
sure. In fact, I had to drop out a couple of times, 
just very temporarily, because when I got

17:35.406 --> 17:46.399
promoted to lieutenant colonel, there was no slot 
for me. I got the promotion, and then the slot did

17:47.581 --> 17:52.727
not... stay for some circumstance and I had to drop 
out for six months or some such thing but I stayed I

17:53.399 --> 18:18.360
stayed continued with the unit on an unpaid basis 
just because I was interested in it and and then it

17:53.399 --> 18:18.360
opened right back up and I got back in and when I was 
promoted to a full colonel I think I got out just

17:53.399 --> 18:18.360
shortly but Anyhow, everything worked great. 
Well, that's the thing about your career in the

18:22.011 --> 18:25.576
reserves. For 14 years, you're not promoted at 
all, and then from 1960 to 1966, the matoric rise,

18:25.616 --> 18:33.366
this one promotion after another. How can you 
account for that? Well, here again, it's just one

18:34.848 --> 18:49.427
of those things where when I got promoted to 
lieutenant colonel, I got the opportunity to go to

18:34.848 --> 18:49.427
command general staff school, which made me 
eligible for... on up and very shortly thereafter

18:50.032 --> 19:13.660
well the man who was in the full colonel slot well he 
died so I was moved into that slot and then see I was

18:50.032 --> 19:13.660
only a full colonel just two years or two years and A 
little over something, a very minimum of time.

19:17.255 --> 19:17.956
Three years. Okay, just under three, wasn't it? 
Mm-hmm. And at that time then, Cliff Samang, who

19:22.241 --> 19:31.230
was my predecessor, had mandatory retirement. 
See, a brigade commander did have mandatory. He

19:34.634 --> 19:36.656
had a time limit. It was either 30 years or five 
years in grade, whichever came later. So he had

19:41.981 --> 19:43.663
mandatory retirement. and I moved into his slot. 
So, why they used to hoot on me, I said, once I got off

19:46.456 --> 19:52.890
that major spot that I really went up. And it does 
look funny.

19:58.262 --> 20:00.426
In other words, there wasn't any time in grade? I 
mean, you were a lieutenant colonel, um, just for

20:03.539 --> 20:06.142
three years? There would have been. Then you were a 
colonel for less than three years? That's right.

20:10.268 --> 20:14.593
You didn't have to be a colonel for five years and a 
lieutenant colonel for four years? No, I think a

20:14.613 --> 20:25.147
full colonel, you had to be a full colonel 30

20:14.613 --> 20:25.147
months, three years. I was right on top of it. I was 
just barely eligible. Of course, I stayed a

20:30.714 --> 20:33.377
colonel six months after I was assigned to the, as a 
brigade commander. Right. But I was just under the

20:38.553 --> 20:40.616
wire. How many officers did you have in that 
brigade that were a similar rank? Similar rank?

20:47.404 --> 20:49.928
Rank, yeah, that were lieutenant colonels or 
colonels. Well, let's see. Only the,

20:52.110 --> 20:59.340
well, there was only one colonel in the 420th. Then 
there was There were two groups, and each of them

21:02.635 --> 21:07.341
had a full colonel. There were only three. And then 
there were probably five or six lieutenant

21:09.764 --> 21:14.410
colonels. But just three full colonels in the 
brigade at that time. Well, why'd they pick you

21:20.798 --> 21:23.101
instead of some of the other colonels? Just 
thought I was more qualified. That's what I like to

21:27.927 --> 21:31.171
think. And another thing. I lived here, and the 
unit was here, and I'm sure that had something to do

21:32.808 --> 21:37.935
with it. But I know that Cliff Samang recommended 
me highly, and I know that the higher headquarters

21:39.216 --> 21:54.316
take the present brigade commander's 
recommendations. I know they're evaluated. That

21:56.959 --> 22:01.465
doesn't mean that they always go along with it, but 
I do know that he recommended me. So in the fact that

22:03.723 --> 22:13.898
I was an engineer officer,

22:03.723 --> 22:13.898
I can't help but think they thought I was the most 
qualified. Now, we talked about this for a few

22:14.518 --> 22:19.045
minutes after the tape recorder was off 
yesterday. And that is that you were appointed

22:19.666 --> 22:26.756
district engineer for district 17 of the highway 
department in the summer of 1966. And then six

22:27.537 --> 22:32.464
months later, you were appointed general. Was 
there any relationship there? Do you think that

22:37.233 --> 22:45.401
the fact that you have this new position of 
responsibility with the highway department

22:37.233 --> 22:45.401
might have had some bearing on the fact that you 
were made a general? I don't believe so.

22:51.067 --> 22:54.410
The command position called for a brigadier 
general. Now, the only question at that time, they

22:55.532 --> 23:01.017
had a few surplus brigadier generals in the 
reserve program and there was in fact when they

23:01.604 --> 23:30.936
called me and told me they were signing me to the 
420th this major general said to me this doesn't

23:01.604 --> 23:30.936
necessarily mean you're going to get a promotion 
because they feasibly could assign some other

23:01.604 --> 23:30.936
brigadier general to sign this unit to take up that 
slot in other words he's a surplus unassigned

23:31.507 --> 23:37.172
officer somewhere, and if he wanted that unit, 
they'd consider assigning him. So he said, that

23:37.753 --> 23:43.999
doesn't necessarily follow that you'll be 
promoted, but he said, I'm going to recommend you.

23:44.019 --> 23:47.982
So the unit, it just called for a brigadier 
general. If I was going to command the unit

23:48.283 --> 23:54.709
continuously, then they almost had to promote me. 
But within that six months time, they could have

23:56.010 --> 24:01.395
brought somebody else in and relieved me and and 
given him the unit, not one to be promoted, I don't

24:01.932 --> 24:09.945
think, but if they had had a surplus brigadier 
general, they could have done that. Now, did you

24:10.886 --> 24:28.834
really tell what you were telling me yesterday 
about how one day you got a phone call and the next

24:10.886 --> 24:28.834
day... Well, I had been interviewed by my boss in 
the highway department for possibly assigning me

24:10.886 --> 24:28.834
as a district engineer for the highway 
department, and The districts, the highway

24:29.725 --> 24:33.750
department is divided in 25 districts. That's a 
very prestigious job in the highway department.

24:37.815 --> 24:41.120
That's lots of responsibility and lots of 
latitude. Works with broad guidelines. And he had

24:46.326 --> 24:56.880
interviewed me and he called me and I'm not certain 
whether, he called me one day and the army man

24:46.326 --> 24:56.880
called me the next, but On a Tuesday, I was called by 
one of them and said he was assigning me as District

24:58.075 --> 25:05.468
Engineer of the Highway Department. I was called 
the next day, almost the same time of day, just

25:05.488 --> 25:18.771
before noon, that I had been assigned as the 
commanding officer of the 420th Engineer

25:05.488 --> 25:18.771
Brigade, which called for Brigadier General. So 
two days in a row, I got very prestigious

25:18.791 --> 25:23.138
assignments. The greatest two years of your life. 
Two days. That's right. Somebody said that was my

25:30.918 --> 25:33.422
blue ribbon week, and it was. It led to great things 
for me.

25:41.434 --> 25:47.403
I had a marvelous career, both civilian-wise and 
Army. I was at the right place a lot of times. I had

25:53.560 --> 26:02.429
some excellent recommendations apparently and 
got moved in some slots that were most rewarding.

26:03.170 --> 26:07.234
Now let's move back to the Reserves right after the 
Second World War. It sounds like they were

26:07.314 --> 26:09.696
somewhat in disarray. That's correct. They had, 
of course, not had any chance to regroup after the

26:13.060 --> 26:18.705
war. Yeah. A world of people that were discharged 
were sick and tired of war, army. They went here,

26:27.165 --> 26:29.428
thither, and yon. And it was a matter of gathering 
some little nucleuses for people to go to

26:30.670 --> 26:39.761
responding to and building around. So it was 
almost a total rebuilding job. And that's what

26:45.198 --> 26:50.948
sounds like happened from 46 into today, as a 
matter of fact. That's right. Of course, well, I

26:53.031 --> 27:06.514
guess starting

26:53.031 --> 27:06.514
in, I want to say now about,

27:09.329 --> 27:15.035
middle and latter 50s and early 60s there was a 
great emphasis put on the reserve program. Why do

27:15.335 --> 27:16.296
you think that was? Well I guess the result of the 
Korean War they saw the need for a strong reserve

27:17.678 --> 27:33.815
and lots of monies were appropriated and built 
armories and when you got nice facilities that

27:17.678 --> 27:33.815
lends itself. Of course another thing was the The 
fact that we still had the draft, and the draft

27:37.561 --> 27:44.430
assisted the reserve program greatly. Sure.

27:50.397 --> 27:55.343
Erroneously, people referred to reservists as 
draft dodgers. And that was completely

27:57.145 --> 28:00.209
erroneous. The reserve was a form of a man 
fulfilling his requirement. The draft was

28:07.953 --> 28:10.316
another. Now, it's true, I'm quite sure, that many 
people knew they would be drafted and got in the

28:10.336 --> 28:21.810
reserve because they could stay at home, they 
could drill on weekends, they could go to summer

28:10.336 --> 28:21.810
camps. But that was the law. I mean, that was legal. 
But a lot of people got called raft dodgers for

28:28.738 --> 28:32.903
getting in the reserve. But I'll tell you for sure, 
we had waiting lines to get in. throughout the

28:37.568 --> 28:38.429
1950s. Oh, yes. Well, it varied, but it seemed to me 
like it started in the later 50s and in the 60s.

28:51.461 --> 28:59.089
There were a few times that we had lists, and there 
were some pretty stringent requirements on who

28:51.461 --> 28:59.089
you took in the reserve. I mean, it wasn't unusual 
to get a congressional on why you took so-and-so

29:00.090 --> 29:07.457
over this person. What do you mean, get a 
congressional? Well, an investigation. Oh,

29:10.683 --> 29:11.504
really? Congressional investigation. No 
kidding? People would write to the congressman, I

29:14.408 --> 29:21.075
wasn't taken in this reserve unit, and I ought to 
have gotten in, and you know, this type of thing. No

29:21.095 --> 29:21.836
kidding. Was that more in the 60s or the war in 
Vietnam? No, well, I really don't remember the

29:25.580 --> 29:37.393
time frame, but it was during the time that the 
draft was very active and people were... were

29:37.610 --> 29:41.634
utilizing the reserve to fulfill their 
obligations, and they wanted in. But it has

29:43.236 --> 29:45.158
seesawed. There'd be times that you can't get them 
in the reserve. Then there are times that you've

29:49.363 --> 29:56.470
got a waiting list for reserve, and right now 
they're having trouble again getting them in the

29:49.363 --> 29:56.470
reserve. But the draft played a great part in 
keeping the reserve program going. I would think

30:01.676 --> 30:03.718
so.
