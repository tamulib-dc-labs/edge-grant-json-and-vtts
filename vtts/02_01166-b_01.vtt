00:04.823 --> 00:14.292
Okay, this is Ron Shorn interviewing Ray Newbern 
at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,

00:04.823 --> 00:14.292
California on June 16, 1993. Ray, for the record, 
what's your full name? Ray Leon Newbern, Jr. And

00:19.717 --> 00:24.862
where and when were you born? January 9, 1933, Rock 
Island, Illinois. How did you get interested in

00:31.728 --> 00:33.970
astronomy in the first place? I read a Sunday 
Supplement in a newspaper when I was in the fourth

00:34.743 --> 00:44.733
grade, probably at that time, in the old Herald 
Examiner. Except I guess it was the Herald Express

00:45.714 --> 00:51.200
in those days, before they combined with the 
Examiner. Got very excited about this article

00:51.881 --> 00:55.124
about the solar system. Started asking my folks 
questions. They didn't know the answers. Said,

00:58.067 --> 01:00.750
you know what you're supposed to do when you want 
the answer to something, and we don't know the

01:01.540 --> 01:04.463
answer, go to the library. So I started reading 
books on astronomy, and the next thing I knew, I was

01:04.503 --> 01:07.847
hooked. Okay. Did you keep that interest in 
astronomy through high school? Yes, very much so.

01:15.015 --> 01:16.416
Where did you go to high school, by the way? 
Glendale High, Glendale, California. So where

01:20.501 --> 01:22.122
did you go to undergraduate school? Well, just 
tell me your schooling. I went to Caltech in

01:25.986 --> 01:30.231
September of 1950. Got my bachelor's degree there 
in 1954, a master's degree in 55. I did the

01:36.156 --> 01:39.481
coursework for a doctorate. And then in the summer 
of 56, I came to work at JPL rather than continuing

01:40.583 --> 01:54.485
as I had in a couple of previous summers at Mount 
Wilson Observatory because I was $3,500 in debt

01:40.583 --> 01:54.485
and needed the money. JPL offered me twice as much 
money as Mount Wilson. So I came to work at JPL. And

02:01.158 --> 02:04.221
it turns out I never went back to school then. I 
stayed at JPL. I've been here just over 37 years

02:05.642 --> 02:08.185
now. What did JPL hire you to do? Well, the first job 
I did that I was really looking at seriously was the

02:12.990 --> 02:21.960
flame attenuation of electromagnetic 
radiation. They were still doing radio guidance

02:22.480 --> 02:24.863
in those days. And they were concerned about the 
radio signals for guidance being attenuated by

02:28.497 --> 02:31.720
the rocket plume. And so it was a problem in pure 
physics. There was no real astronomy here, and

02:33.442 --> 02:36.886
that's what I was doing that summer. Was that 
Sergeant or Corporal? Actually, in those days, it

02:41.271 --> 02:45.936
was, I think, a concern about both. Both were 
certainly... Corporal was in the field, and

02:47.177 --> 02:54.105
Sergeant was still under development.

02:55.867 --> 02:56.327
When did When did JPL start getting interested in 
astronomy? Well, the first action that I got

03:02.062 --> 03:24.238
involved in that was really astronomy occurred 
when Marsha Neugebauer and I wrote a series of

03:02.062 --> 03:24.238
articles, or articles, but just position papers 
on some of the things that we might do in space in

03:02.062 --> 03:24.238
early 1958.

03:24.775 --> 03:38.808
This was in response to Explorer 1 having gone up 
and people starting to think ahead as to what it

03:24.775 --> 03:38.808
might be possible to do with these newfangled 
rockets and space probes. And the result of that

03:39.929 --> 03:53.702
position paper, which was strictly an on-lab 
thing, was that I was made part of a Tiger team set up

03:39.929 --> 03:53.702
by Al Hipps in the fall of 1958. to formally look 
into these problems of what should we do in our

03:53.969 --> 03:59.296
studies of the solar system. And this all finally 
resulted in Marsha and I writing the report 30-1,

03:59.797 --> 04:16.120
which was the formal report of Al Hibbs' Tiger 
Team, and we did the science section.

04:16.140 --> 04:20.466
Okay, did that report have any, did anything come 
out of that? Yeah, I mean, it was accepted by NASA,

04:21.475 --> 04:31.487
and I think it was widely used initially as sort of 
an outline of the things we ought to be attempting

04:21.475 --> 04:31.487
to do in space. And it was very widely used and 
quoted for a few years until we began to try to do

04:32.288 --> 04:37.755
some of these things. Found some of them were a 
little harder than we thought. But actually, I

04:39.737 --> 04:44.103
think virtually everything in that report we 
finally did. Maybe not quite on the time scale we

04:44.263 --> 04:46.626
expected. Took a little longer, but we finally did 
it all. When did you get to be able to start to do some

04:51.597 --> 04:57.944
astronomy

04:51.597 --> 04:57.944
at JPL? Well, we created an astronomy group here 
in, I believe, 1961. People

05:06.413 --> 05:16.845
were convinced that we needed some astronomers 
around doing astronomy to maintain, I think,

05:17.483 --> 05:43.845
recognition in the field and to give proper advice 
and mostly we were concerned about the fact there

05:17.483 --> 05:43.845
was almost no planetary astronomy going on in the 
United States in those days we knew that we were

05:17.483 --> 05:43.845
going to need ground-based support of the space 
program no one else seemed willing to do it so we got

05:17.483 --> 05:43.845
the idea well let's see what we can do in a small way 
ourselves and when a small 16-inch The telescope

05:44.078 --> 05:47.022
came on the market for, I believe, $8,000. It was 
for sale by a private party here in the basin. I

05:51.888 --> 05:55.173
talked the boss into buying it. Who was the boss? 
And housing it. In those days, it was Al Hitz was the

05:57.395 --> 06:02.182
division manager. Fred Eimer was his deputy. And, 
gosh, who was the section manager? Shortly after

06:11.146 --> 06:14.511
that, Luke Kaplan came on board as the section 
manager. I think at the time this actually

06:14.591 --> 06:19.539
happened, it was probably either Herb Trostle or 
John Porter. All right, so you got this 16-inch and

06:21.002 --> 06:24.507
where'd you put it? We looked at several 
possibilities. I talked to Ira Bowen, and he had

06:27.131 --> 06:35.044
agreed that we could use a site just north of the 
100-inch dome on Mount Wilson. But, of course, we

06:35.412 --> 06:48.750
would have been distinctly visitors, and he said 
that their facilities were sufficiently loaded

06:35.412 --> 06:48.750
and water was short, and we'd have to bring in 
everything that we wanted to use and stay in the old

06:35.412 --> 06:48.750
Mount Wilson Hotel and what have you. We looked at 
Chileo, but we looked longest and hardest and

06:49.671 --> 06:58.603
finally went in to Table Mountain because the 
Smithsonian was just moving out. They had done

06:58.663 --> 07:01.707
solar constant work there for some... 25 or 30 
years, I guess. There were primitive facilities

07:06.085 --> 07:13.436
there already, and the Forest Service was happy to 
have someone take over the site. And, of course, we

07:13.456 --> 07:24.773
had seeing studies as well for the site since it had 
been one of the areas where Caltech had looked as a

07:13.456 --> 07:24.773
possible site for the 200-inch reflector. And 
they found that it was as good as Palomar from the

07:24.793 --> 07:29.500
point of view of astronomical seeing, And at that 
time, from the point of view of city lights, but it

07:29.817 --> 07:36.126
was very close to the San Andreas Fault. So they 
went to Palomar instead of to Table Mountain. But

07:39.470 --> 07:42.114
we had all those seeing studies, and we knew it was a 
good site. So we grabbed it.

07:47.962 --> 07:49.985
Who were the early people that were hired on? I 
guess High Spinrad was one of the earliest to come

07:50.025 --> 07:55.353
in after you formed your astronomical section. 
Yeah, High Spinrad, Bob Youngkin. Yourself, Ron

08:00.023 --> 08:04.890
Scharn, were the first people that were involved. 
We hired a man by the name of Charles Caveman. He

08:09.055 --> 08:22.894
went by the name Chick, who would actually act as 
the on-site manager, supervisor, holder of

08:09.055 --> 08:22.894
hands, repairer of problems, and so on at the 
mountain. I know where High and I came from. Do you

08:24.757 --> 08:26.419
remember where Bob Youngkin came from? He was 
actually working on his doctorate at UCLA at the

08:26.568 --> 08:43.429
time, and he was married, family, and needed to 
work, and so he was just working on his doctorate in

08:26.568 --> 08:43.429
his spare time, and he did finally finish it years 
later. I guess you got interested in planetary

08:44.118 --> 08:48.004
astronomy right from the start, right? From the 
Sunday supplement? That's true. Although when I

08:49.987 --> 08:57.938
was a student at Caltech, my work and my interests 
lay mostly in galactic structure and cosmology.

08:58.720 --> 09:11.779
And my published work there, a major paper that I 
did, was on the RR Lyrae variables in NGC 4147,

08:58.720 --> 09:11.779
published in the AJ the year I came to work at the 
lab. But here, of course, the interest was in

09:12.687 --> 09:18.075
planetary, and I loved astronomy generally. So at 
that time, it was easily possible for a person to

09:19.156 --> 09:30.012
know everything there was to know about the field 
of solar system astronomy, quite unlike today. So

09:30.873 --> 09:35.781
I just sort of made myself a universalist on the 
solar system. Back, say, in 1958 or 1960, your

09:36.081 --> 09:40.888
opinion Did real, quote-unquote, astronomers 
look down on planetary types? Very much so. Did you

09:47.399 --> 09:48.381
feel inferior? Not really, no. Because you were 
working on planets. I didn't think so. I thought

09:52.149 --> 09:58.843
that most of the attitude that astronomers had was 
because of a few unfortunate...

10:00.427 --> 10:15.813
Articles of people who tended to follow Percival 
Lowell's school of study of Mars and that the

10:00.427 --> 10:15.813
Sunday supplements, in fact, even though one is 
what attracted me to the field, had given the

10:00.427 --> 10:15.813
people who were interested in the solar system a 
bad name. But if one looked, one found people like

10:15.894 --> 10:18.618
G.P. Kuiper, who was doing good, reputable work. 
Of course, the people at Mount Wilson, like Dunham

10:21.283 --> 10:24.949
and Adams and And Nicholson and Pettit had done 
good work, solid physical, astrophysical work on

10:25.216 --> 10:32.526
the planets throughout the 30s. And Kuiper picked 
it up in the 40s. And it was a perfectly good, honest

10:35.891 --> 10:40.077
field. It's just that it had gotten a little bit of a 
bad rep that people who didn't know too much about

10:40.197 --> 10:54.497
it tended to look at the infamous Lowellian school 
of the solar system instead of the solid physical

10:40.197 --> 10:54.497
work. Do you think planetary astronomy and the 
planetary astronomers are considered

10:55.118 --> 11:01.929
respectable today by the other astronomers? I 
think very much so. I do not feel today that they

11:03.351 --> 11:16.471
draw any distinction as to the quality of a person 
because he works in the field of solar system

11:03.351 --> 11:16.471
research rather than in stellar or galactic 
research. I think that most modern astronomers

11:16.531 --> 11:20.738
probably feel that This study may not be quite as 
fundamental, shall we say, as studying the Big

11:21.038 --> 11:43.266
Bang or trying to solve some of what they consider 
basic problems of the first few seconds of the

11:21.038 --> 11:43.266
universe or the missing mass or the great 
attractor or the great celestial voids or what

11:21.038 --> 11:43.266
have you, but I don't think they... They probably 
look at it as sort of a different field, almost like

11:44.005 --> 11:55.360
biology and chemistry are a different field, not 
necessarily inferior, but just different and not

11:44.005 --> 11:55.360
as interesting to them.

11:56.301 --> 12:05.934
Again, back when you got started doing this, say 
around 1960, what was planetary astronomy like in

11:56.301 --> 12:05.934
the U.S.? It was almost non-existent. Really, 
G.P. Kuiper... was the only one who was doing

12:09.790 --> 12:19.104
modern physical observing of the planets at that 
particular time that I can think of off the top of my

12:09.790 --> 12:19.104
head. We had a very few people in celestial 
mechanics, about six of them, I think. We had

12:25.673 --> 12:39.173
Clements, and Brower, and Herget, and Herbig, not 
Herbig, Robbie,

12:25.673 --> 12:39.173
Herrick was the other one I was trying to think of. 
That was just about it. Brown of the lunar theory

12:43.746 --> 12:46.390
was dead by then. And in fact, there were so few 
people even who knew celestial mechanics that

12:47.712 --> 13:09.244
when the space program hit, the lab started 
shipping people en masse back to a special summer

12:47.712 --> 13:09.244
school that Dirk Brouwer held at Yale to teach 
people what celestial mechanics was all about,

12:47.712 --> 13:09.244
because the subject wasn't even taught at 
Caltech, for example.

13:10.473 --> 13:18.986
Where do you think planetary astronomy would be 
now if it wasn't for the money NASA has spent in the

13:10.473 --> 13:18.986
last 30 years? Obviously it would be a very, very 
different field. I don't think, if we didn't have

13:22.171 --> 13:30.564
the space program, I think there would still be a 
few isolated individuals who would study the

13:22.171 --> 13:30.564
planets from time to time. Anytime you get new 
techniques, new instruments, new equipment,

13:35.701 --> 13:47.920
Somebody's going to apply them to the obvious 
objects that are near at hand, like the planets,

13:35.701 --> 13:47.920
but I don't think it would have, well, much of our 
knowledge has clearly been found by the space

13:35.701 --> 13:47.920
probes. Possibly, I don't know, maybe a quarter as 
much of it has been found from the ground. And I

13:57.503 --> 14:03.050
don't think there would have been but a fraction of 
that if it hadn't been for NASA and the space

13:57.503 --> 14:03.050
program. I think the interest would not have been 
there. The people wouldn't have been attracted to

14:04.732 --> 14:06.934
the field. The telescopes wouldn't have been 
available for this less interesting work, less

14:07.695 --> 14:14.263
fundamental work as it were. I think it's, there's 
no question that NASA and the coming space program

14:14.283 --> 14:20.571
changed the whole field. Do you think that 
planetary astronomy is a part of astronomy? Yes. I

14:24.976 --> 14:25.377
do. I think that there are many people in the field 
whose background is more geology or meteorology

14:26.218 --> 14:49.011
than it is astronomy, but I think astronomers play 
a particular role, especially in the study of

14:26.218 --> 14:49.011
objects like comets and asteroids, the small 
bodies of the solar system, where they're still

14:26.218 --> 14:49.011
basically not looking at geological or 
meteorological processes. And similarly, with

14:49.833 --> 14:54.139
many of the satellites in the solar system, I think 
we all have something And one of the interesting

14:54.406 --> 15:02.783
things about modern solar system astronomy is 
that it isn't just astronomy, but it's also

14:54.406 --> 15:02.783
geology and meteorology. And I think everybody 
works together very well. Back when this stuff

15:07.191 --> 15:11.520
started in the early 60s, You were in a special 
situation because JPL is actually a contractor to

15:12.395 --> 15:20.145
NASA through Caltech. And how was astronomy 
funded at JPL in those days? Did headquarters give

15:24.070 --> 15:30.839
a block grant to Caltech to be given to JPL to be used 
as JPL saw fit? Or did they say exactly what they

15:30.859 --> 15:34.264
wanted done? This is in the early 60s when this 
stuff began. I was, of course, a very junior person

15:37.994 --> 15:42.159
at JPL in those days. I do not know for sure exactly 
how it was funded. I know that initially I simply

15:45.963 --> 15:55.133
got my money from my superiors, and if they thought 
what I wanted to do was right, then they found me the

15:45.963 --> 15:55.133
money to do it. So my guess is it was probably a block 
grant. I know that when I began building the Table

15:58.577 --> 16:06.786
Mountain Observatory and that I had a... brand, if 
you will, although it was not the result of a

16:07.137 --> 16:10.966
proposal. I simply sent a proposal to NASA, as it 
were. It wasn't reviewed as they are today, and

16:14.213 --> 16:22.632
they decided if what I proposed to do was 
reasonable, and they sent me the money to run the

16:22.882 --> 16:29.130
ground-based astronomy program at Table 
Mountain, for example, and to fund a number of

16:22.882 --> 16:29.130
people to work on it and work there. So in that 
sense, it was a block grant, not to JPL. It came in

16:34.497 --> 16:38.422
that case to me, and I was responsible for it. But 
earlier, it had come to my bosses, and so I suppose

16:38.442 --> 16:44.610
you would call that a block grant. It certainly was 
not money to an individual to do a specific kind of

16:44.650 --> 16:48.995
work. And how is it done today? Today, of course, it 
is very much The individual who is funded, if the

16:53.020 --> 16:57.485
individual leaves, the money goes with him or her. 
And that money is on the basis of competitive

16:58.406 --> 17:04.051
proposals to do specific things. And it is much 
today as if you were working in a university going

17:05.193 --> 17:12.400
to NASA or to the NSF for funds. It's a totally 
different approach to doing the research.

17:22.062 --> 17:24.064
in some ways is not as pleasant, of course. It was 
much easier when if you saw something new and

17:24.364 --> 17:35.055
exciting and interesting, you could jump into it 
without having to worry about whether this was

17:24.364 --> 17:35.055
covered in your proposal and exactly what you 
would plan to do. But I suppose it also left

17:36.196 --> 17:46.467
possibilities for people to not do exactly what 
was right.

17:48.083 --> 17:53.790
As I recall, back in the early 60s, those of us that 
were observing kind of did what we could. There was

17:53.810 --> 17:55.432
so much to do. How is it done today? I mean, does the 
section chief or division chief say, we shall

17:57.975 --> 18:12.353
study Pluto this year and everybody follows, or 
since now everybody has to get grants on their own,

17:57.975 --> 18:12.353
do they propose what they want to do? Individuals 
propose what they want to do today. I think any

18:15.332 --> 18:28.853
section manager in the science division at JPL who 
tried to tell an individual what he had to work on

18:15.332 --> 18:28.853
would sort of be laughed out of town, unless of 
course he had money and the individual wanted the

18:15.332 --> 18:28.853
money, then that's something else again. But in 
general, It's left up to the individual today.

18:32.107 --> 18:35.452
This is true to a large extent. However, in times 
when billets become tight, then it may be that the

18:35.492 --> 18:45.808
lab or the division or the section may decide that, 
hey, we've got to cut back a little bit. And so they

18:46.429 --> 18:55.502
may look at those activities which seem less 
related to the flight programs of NASA and of the

18:46.429 --> 18:55.502
laboratory and decide that, hey, let's not say 
decide, let's sort of suggest to the person that if

18:56.005 --> 19:09.645
he or she wants to continue in employment at the 
lab, it might be better to look for a new field that

18:56.005 --> 19:09.645
is more akin to the needs of the laboratory. 
However, that person, of course, if he or she has

19:10.507 --> 19:17.818
money, can take that money and go elsewhere and do 
it. JPL never did get a big telescope on Table

19:18.619 --> 19:21.523
Mountain. Not really, no. We tried, of course, and 
that's a big story in and of itself. However, in

19:27.639 --> 19:44.317
recent years, we did get from the Air Force the old 
48-inch ALT-ALT-AS telescope that was at

19:27.639 --> 19:44.317
Cloudcroft, and this now has been erected on Table 
Mountain and, in fact, is going into regular

19:27.639 --> 19:44.317
scheduled observation in about two weeks. There 
is also a 40-inch reflector on Table Mountain that

19:45.639 --> 19:50.464
is owned by Pomona College, And the time on that 
telescope is available, half of the time is

19:50.765 --> 19:56.872
available to the people at JPL. What 
instrumentation, and also you have a 24-inch, is

19:57.733 --> 20:02.459
that still in operation? 24-inch is very much in 
operation. It's been the one instrument that has

20:05.122 --> 20:13.752
produced pretty good science throughout all of 
the years that Table Mountain has existed, which

20:05.122 --> 20:13.752
number roughly 30 now. Well, of course, the 
24-inch wasn't there initially. It came in a few

20:17.965 --> 20:20.929
years later, but let's say 25 years. Yeah, it has a 
large cu-day spectrograph on it, which was

20:22.251 --> 20:36.091
heavily used at first, has been more lightly used 
in recent years, but I guess there are people

20:22.251 --> 20:36.091
planning to bring it back into full use again. 
There's been a great deal of photoelectric

20:36.491 --> 20:40.397
photometry, and imaging with CCDs and prior to 
that Vidicon type detectors on the 24 inch. What

20:48.457 --> 20:54.182
kind of foci do the 40 inch and 48 inch have that are 
available? I've never seen the 40 inch. I have no

20:55.763 --> 20:58.266
idea what is available there. In the case of the 48 
inch, again, I haven't been on the mountain now in

20:59.046 --> 21:08.595
more than 10 years. I have information here that I 
can give you that shows the exact instrumentation

21:08.862 --> 21:19.838
and foci and so on on the 48-inch, but I shouldn't 
really say off the top of my head. We'll get to that

21:20.259 --> 21:21.080
later. You mentioned that JPL's attempt to get a 
decent-sized, not a big telescope, but a 100-inch

21:22.743 --> 21:29.132
class. It's a long story. Let's talk about some of 
that story. How did the idea start, or was it

21:34.211 --> 21:41.137
obvious to everyone that you needed a dedicated 
planetary telescope? Well, I think with all of us

21:41.178 --> 21:50.567
here, it was obvious to us when we went out and tried 
to get time on existing large telescopes that that

21:41.178 --> 21:50.567
time simply was not available for planetary work. 
All of the telescopes were very busy, and even in

21:51.668 --> 21:59.676
those days there were more astronomers wanting 
time than there was time available.

22:01.107 --> 22:10.295
And when good young people could not get time at the 
major instruments, it was pretty obvious that we

22:01.107 --> 22:10.295
needed a major instrument of our own. And I 
couldn't say that any one person was responsible

22:11.316 --> 22:16.140
for that idea. It was a very obvious one. If you 
can't get the time you need, you better build your

22:17.702 --> 22:23.327
own. And that, in fact, was what was suggested by 
people like Ira Bowen, who was then the director at

22:23.407 --> 22:29.612
Mount Wilson. And he, in fact, helped a great deal 
in pushing NASA into the idea that they needed to

22:30.503 --> 22:39.332
build their own telescope for planetary 
astronomy. He certainly agreed that there was

22:39.893 --> 22:48.462
still a great deal of good, solid astrophysical 
work on the planets that could be done with modern

22:39.893 --> 22:48.462
equipment. He was, I think, a very honest, 
straightforward, actually rather far-thinking

22:49.663 --> 22:57.912
individual who recognized the fact that there was 
a great deal left to be done from the ground, and he

22:58.415 --> 23:12.348
gave a lot of good advice to NASA, suggesting that 
they should go ahead and build their own

22:58.415 --> 23:12.348
telescope.

23:13.108 --> 23:27.021
I got Homer Newell to sign two things, and one was 
for a telescope at the McDonald Observatory at the

23:13.108 --> 23:27.021
University of Texas, and one was for what I thought 
was going to be a telescope on Table Mountain.

23:27.423 --> 23:30.347
whatever happened about that time in the 
left-hand corner? Caltech, unfortunately, is

23:30.367 --> 23:32.330
what happened. The feeling was that since we were 
young and not well-known, and there were a lot of

23:34.594 --> 23:45.930
famous astronomers at Caltech, that this ought to 
be some kind of a joint effort between Caltech and

23:34.594 --> 23:45.930
JPL. Unfortunately, what JPL wanted was a good 
telescope in a good site that could get to work in a

23:45.950 --> 23:55.945
hurry, doing astronomical research what caltech 
wanted was a really new modern earth-shaking

23:56.363 --> 24:20.937
telescope in the world's very best possible site 
and their idea was to perhaps do a five-year seeing

23:56.363 --> 24:20.937
survey and some work was actually done on that 
telescopes were mounted at white mountain for

23:56.363 --> 24:20.937
example for a time and We got information from 
Berkeley, who had also mounted a seeing study up

24:21.203 --> 24:25.828
there. But they really began looking for the 
world's greatest site for a planetary telescope,

24:27.069 --> 24:35.557
thinking that seeing was all important in 
planetary detail work. And they had a very long

24:36.678 --> 24:39.581
range plan. I think that what it finally came down 
to was that their idea of what needed to be done and

24:41.103 --> 24:48.730
ours were so different, and I think both Well, NASA 
also wanted to get on the air, so to speak. So we

24:53.529 --> 25:05.531
could never reach an agreement with Caltech that 
we both felt comfortable with and finally wound

24:53.529 --> 25:05.531
up, as I understood it, with money going to Hawaii, 
which of course was a very superior site, as it

24:53.529 --> 25:05.531
turned out. Right, but which had no astronomers 
whatsoever except a few solar types. That's

25:10.119 --> 25:11.562
right. Then there was another project that I guess 
finally became the infrared telescope facility

25:12.368 --> 25:19.075
in Lunakea, the light bucket. Do you remember the 
light? JPL was going to build a light bucket. How

25:21.557 --> 25:22.418
did that get started? Was it Frank Gray involved in 
that or something? I never knew the details on that

25:25.321 --> 25:28.164
one, Ron. I wish I had. Frank Gray was the assistant 
section manager in those days, and he could very

25:30.486 --> 25:37.633
well have been heavily involved in it. But by that 
time, I was not heavily involved any longer in the

25:37.968 --> 25:43.157
field. I had pushed hard to build a... I had even the 
blueprints in my office for the 84-inch Kitt Peak,

25:45.761 --> 25:52.453
which we were proposing to duplicate to save time. 
Again, here was an existing working telescope,

25:52.533 --> 26:00.567
and we had a complete set of blueprints for it, and 
it would have been easy and cheap to simply

25:52.533 --> 26:00.567
duplicate everything at Table Mountain. When 
that money didn't come, we had preliminary

26:01.188 --> 26:07.696
designs for a 48-inch, preliminary designs for a 
60-inch.

26:10.499 --> 26:11.460
We got none of those. And when it became obvious the 
telescope was going elsewhere, in fact, I got

26:12.621 --> 26:25.296
heavily involved in other areas, in particular in 
work on comets and advanced comet missions. And

26:25.436 --> 26:30.182
part of the problem was that I didn't have my Ph.D., 
And at that time, I had a division manager who

26:30.550 --> 26:36.820
didn't go by what you did, but by what your 
credentials were. Who was? Robert Magreblian.

26:40.446 --> 26:52.525
And he moved me out of the slot as head of the 
astronomy group and put me in charge of a group

26:40.446 --> 26:52.525
which was doing models of the planets for the 
projects. And I did that and various advanced

26:53.426 --> 26:55.950
studies. And then from there, started studying 
comet missions, got extremely interested in

26:56.487 --> 27:15.390
comets, and began my own research program in 
cometary astrophysics, and started going to

26:56.487 --> 27:15.390
other observatories and working with other 
people, and sort of divorced myself from the

26:56.487 --> 27:15.390
astronomy program at JPL. I tried to do some work at 
Table Mountain, but it was so ill-funded by the

27:16.484 --> 27:27.234
mid-'70s that we didn't have the manpower to even 
keep the auxiliary instrumentation running

27:16.484 --> 27:27.234
properly. And so from the mid-'70s on, I worked on 
advanced studies at JPL of comet missions and then

27:27.314 --> 27:41.026
did my own research at other places like Mauna Kea 
and later at Lick Observatory. That brings up an

27:41.907 --> 27:43.668
interesting question. Through the 20s and 30s and 
40s, when solar system studies in general had a bad

27:47.146 --> 27:51.372
odor about them. It was always legitimate to study 
comets. Why? Well, comets, I guess, didn't have

27:57.541 --> 28:11.582
any thoughts on anybody's part about life and the 
solar system and a little green man, and comets

27:57.541 --> 28:11.582
were simply a phenomena that had fascinated 
mankind throughout history. They were an

28:11.642 --> 28:15.988
interesting astrophysical problem, both as to 
their origin and to the way they work. What in the

28:18.797 --> 28:19.677
heck are they? What are they made of? And why do they 
behave the way they do? And their problems were

28:22.500 --> 28:35.773
sufficiently enigmatic that they had always 
fascinated even the classical stellar

28:22.500 --> 28:35.773
astronomer, and indeed they remained a subject 
that was always considered quite a legitimate one

28:22.500 --> 28:35.773
for study. And it's sort of ironic that the very 
objects which did remain of interest to the

28:36.153 --> 28:44.001
classic stellar and galactic astronomer are the 
single object to which NASA has never mounted a

28:44.791 --> 28:51.019
mission.

28:52.161 --> 28:56.466
What do you think killed planetary astronomy in 
the early part of this century? Effectively

28:56.487 --> 28:57.488
killed it. I know some was being done, but if you 
look at the journals in 1900 and then you look at

28:57.508 --> 29:05.619
1930, wow, is there a difference. What's the 
reason, or reasons? Well, I think there are, to my

29:08.943 --> 29:14.190
way of thinking, off the top of my head, a couple of 
things can be said about it. For one thing, large

29:14.575 --> 29:32.557
telescopes became available, which gathered a 
great deal of light and allowed people to do

29:14.575 --> 29:32.557
high-resolution spectroscopy, to go deep into 
the universe studying the extragalactic

29:14.575 --> 29:32.557
nebulae, the galaxies, the expansion of the 
universe. These problems were totally

29:32.597 --> 29:34.980
fascinating. But if you wanted to study the 
planets with a large telescope, obviously you

29:35.467 --> 29:46.700
didn't get any better resolution with the large 
telescopes than you did with much smaller ones

29:35.467 --> 29:46.700
simply because you were atmospheric seeing 
limited. People in those days didn't know how much

29:47.661 --> 29:53.648
of that seeing was created locally by 
uncontrolled thermal problems. But in any case, a

29:53.748 --> 29:59.955
big telescope wasn't that much better than a 
little one for studying kind of planetary work

30:00.307 --> 30:08.776
that people had traditionally done, which is to 
say planetary detail, the kind of thing that

30:00.307 --> 30:08.776
Percival Lowell had done. So they sort of went off 
and developed new instrumentation and went off

30:08.796 --> 30:15.223
into the universe. Now, there were always a few 
people who remained in the field, including some

30:15.283 --> 30:22.911
with the biggest telescope in the world, 100 inch 
at that time. But I think it was the fascination

30:23.712 --> 30:28.137
with the deep space problems And the fact that the 
big telescopes couldn't do that much more than the

30:28.741 --> 30:40.837
little ones could in those times on the planets 
that allowed the planetary field to simply die. Do

30:41.999 --> 30:47.426
you think any NSA headquarters tries to 
micromanage scientific projects too much? Well,

30:50.090 --> 30:56.238
not in the individual research particularly. I 
mean, they manage it in the sense that They decide

30:58.913 --> 31:07.745
how much money is available for stellar astronomy 
versus planetary astronomy versus Earth. And

31:08.786 --> 31:22.044
really, if you look at it, the only reason they 
support this research at all is because of the very

31:08.786 --> 31:22.044
complementary way that it blends in with their 
spaceflight missions. But their real interest is

31:22.124 --> 31:24.567
in the missions. And they're simply supporting 
them with this ground-based research. So I think

31:29.583 --> 31:34.529
they don't try to tell an individual what he has to 
do. On the other hand, the amount of money that's

31:34.729 --> 31:42.798
available in a given field is certainly a function 
of their interest in it. Well, the universe we live

31:42.818 --> 31:46.943
in, why, the guy who has the bucks calls the shots. 
Do you think over the years the people at

31:47.834 --> 31:56.725
headquarters really knew what was going on in 
planetary astronomy, or were they playing

31:47.834 --> 31:56.725
catch-up? Well, let's face it. Most of them were 
not planetary astronomers themselves. There

32:00.149 --> 32:03.674
have been obvious exceptions to that, yourself 
among them.

32:07.278 --> 32:16.930
But no person sitting in Washington can really 
retain a feel for the work in the field. It's

32:17.112 --> 32:27.686
virtually impossible, to my way of thinking, for a 
person with a job in Washington to retain a

32:17.112 --> 32:27.686
research program of his own or her own.

32:30.670 --> 32:32.653
The exceptions are very forced. I think if the 
people running the programs at headquarters were

32:34.576 --> 32:45.010
handled perhaps the way section managers are in 
the science sections at JPL, that is on an

32:34.576 --> 32:45.010
alternating, rotating two-year basis, where 
they remained scientists a good part of the time,

32:45.547 --> 32:56.763
but then filled in and devoted a couple of years to 
seeing after NASA's interest, maybe that would be

32:45.547 --> 32:56.763
a solution. But it has been my experience that 
generally when people go to Washington, the very,

32:57.785 --> 33:11.284
very fine people that often go there simply after a 
time become so involved in their own worries about

33:11.635 --> 33:24.685
their programs that they lose any feel for or sight 
of the real research and the real interests of the

33:11.635 --> 33:24.685
people in the field actually doing the work.

33:25.988 --> 33:30.218
What do you think the public thinks of planetary 
astronomy and astronomy in general? I think

33:30.805 --> 33:34.430
they're fascinated by it, probably for a lot of 
wrong reasons. I'm sure that when they think of the

33:34.590 --> 33:52.476
solar system, they're thinking, again, even in 
the classic Lowellian sense of little green men,

33:34.590 --> 33:52.476
and there's certainly a lot of fanatics out there 
in the UFO field and what have you that have a lot of

33:34.590 --> 33:52.476
interest in this sort of thing, but it's all 
misplaced. On the other hand, I think the young

33:53.277 --> 33:56.982
people find... real modern astronomy 
fascinating. Obviously, again, they're

34:01.379 --> 34:14.801
somewhat steered in that direction by the Star 
Wars and Star Trek kind of phenomenon, but I think

34:01.379 --> 34:14.801
it gives them a healthy interest in science, and I 
think they're genuinely interested. I'm not sure

34:15.883 --> 34:18.948
that it's always brought to them in the proper way. 
I'm sure that many adults are don't understand it

34:23.472 --> 34:33.087
at all and perhaps poo-poo it, but I think the 
younger generation has a genuine interest in

34:23.472 --> 34:33.087
astronomy, both solar system and deep space 
astronomy. Do you think planetary astronomers

34:34.308 --> 34:41.920
have done as good a job as they could of putting your 
case across to the public and to Congress?

34:42.575 --> 34:43.476
Probably not. Let's face it, scientists in 
general are not necessarily salespeople. There

34:48.261 --> 34:55.430
have been a few obviously very good salespeople 
for planetary astronomy, like Carl Sagan. And

34:55.450 --> 35:04.600
Carl, I think, usually has done a good job of 
selling it, although there are Maybe some things

35:05.744 --> 35:21.868
that he's done that weren't in our best interest, 
but I think he's a straightforward and honest and

35:05.744 --> 35:21.868
well-meaning guy who's done an awful lot to help 
sell the space program to Congress and to the

35:05.744 --> 35:21.868
world. I think we could use a few more, a little 
different maybe, but a few more similar people.

35:28.818 --> 35:35.228
But I'm sure that the likes of you and I have not 
perhaps done our part and perhaps are not capable

35:36.018 --> 35:41.724
of doing the sales job that needs to be done. Thirty 
years ago, there was just an American

35:44.267 --> 35:47.130
Astronomical Society. Now there's a lot of 
sub-societies, particularly there's the

35:47.170 --> 35:54.457
Division for Planetary Astronomy, which even has 
its own official journal, Icarus. What are these

35:55.879 --> 35:57.640
developments? Do you think, on the whole, that 
they've been good, bad, or just inevitable? I

36:03.018 --> 36:12.870
think they've been good in the sense that it would 
have been very difficult for planetary astronomy

36:03.018 --> 36:12.870
to grow if it had remained totally under the thumb 
of the parent society. By having its own

36:13.330 --> 36:24.144
organization and its own journal and its own 
prizes, why, it could develop as an entity and a

36:13.330 --> 36:24.144
very strong one in its own right. And I think it 
would have been almost impossible for this to

36:24.985 --> 36:31.152
happen under the thumb of the parent society. 
These days, do you think that real quote-unquote

36:31.840 --> 36:38.475
astronomers and planetary astronomers talk to 
each other very much? I think they do, maybe not as

36:40.126 --> 36:58.889
much as they should, but there is a very definite 
attempt to occasionally hold meetings of the

36:40.126 --> 36:58.889
parent society and the divisions jointly, and to 
have prize winners and so on from the divisions

36:40.126 --> 36:58.889
deliver prize lectures at the parent society. I 
think there's much more appreciation for each

37:00.611 --> 37:08.040
other today, certainly, than there was 30 years 
ago.

37:08.527 --> 37:21.199
Feelings are improving, which isn't to say that 
the stellar and galactic astronomers still don't

37:08.527 --> 37:21.199
feel that their field is the real astronomy and 
more important than solar system work. And

37:21.219 --> 37:30.888
probably a lot of them tend to lump solar system 
astronomers into the class along with geologists

37:21.219 --> 37:30.888
and meteorologists as opposed to being real 
astronomers. But I think they respect one another

37:32.310 --> 37:37.875
and are interested in each other's work to an 
extent. Okay, for 35 years now, we've been going to

37:39.458 --> 37:45.686
planets and observing them from the ground and 
spacecraft and directly. Not a trace of, not a

37:47.287 --> 37:55.177
trace of more fossil of any life anywhere in the 
solar system except Earth. In particular, no

37:56.138 --> 37:59.823
trace of life so far on Mars. Do you think that's had 
a big effect on the public and on funding, a big

38:01.224 --> 38:07.592
negative effect, or not? Oh, boy, that's hard to 
say. I think that astronomers never really

38:13.361 --> 38:19.788
expected to find any significant form of life 
anywhere in our solar system. I think many,

38:20.489 --> 38:27.216
perhaps most of them, feel that there may be some 
form of life elsewhere in the galaxy and certainly

38:20.489 --> 38:27.216
in the universe. It's an awfully big universe for 
this to only have happened once. And whether you

38:31.581 --> 38:37.528
think about this from a purely scientific point of 
view or even from a religious point of view... Why

38:37.880 --> 38:42.865
should God create such an enormous universe and 
only inhabit one teeny tiny mote of it? And if you

38:45.769 --> 38:52.075
look at it from a purely biological evolutionary 
point of view, if it happened here, why can't it

38:45.769 --> 38:52.075
have happened somewhere else? So I think most 
scientists probably feel somewhere in the

38:52.136 --> 38:58.482
universe there's life, other than here and here on 
Earth. But none of us really expected to find it in

38:59.023 --> 39:02.527
the solar system. The public in general probably 
did. And some of them may be disappointed by it. And

39:08.402 --> 39:25.470
I think that some of them are put off now, perhaps, 
by people trying to oversell programs on the basis

39:08.402 --> 39:25.470
of

39:08.402 --> 39:25.470
looking for life, even though it is still a 
legitimate thing to do to see if there's any

39:08.402 --> 39:25.470
evidence, let's say, on Mars of... prebiotic 
molecules or of any form of life ever having

39:26.142 --> 39:30.666
existed. This is a legitimate scientific study 
like any other but it's not the kind of thing that's

39:30.726 --> 39:37.213
going to enchant the general public. They want to 
see some walking and talking or at least growling.

39:43.979 --> 39:55.390
A lot of people lately have been getting a lot of 
publicity and some money for studying things like

39:43.979 --> 39:55.390
the possibility of planets around other stars 
Killer asteroids, ozone hole, ozone layer hole,

39:55.927 --> 40:03.315
and the search for extraterrestrial 
intelligence. Do you think those people are

40:03.856 --> 40:06.478
overdoing it a bit or not? I think they're all 
legitimate fields of study. I think that as

40:10.583 --> 40:20.053
virtually every program, they are oversold in the 
sense that they are giving love and motherhood

40:10.583 --> 40:20.053
statements, which are their ultimate goal. The 
implication is that these programs are going to be

40:20.253 --> 40:23.537
solved with a few bucks in a short period of time 
when, in fact, they may not really say that, but the

40:23.956 --> 40:39.696
implication is there, whereas, in fact, most of 
these are very long-range programs and are going

40:23.956 --> 40:39.696
to have to be followed for many decades to have any 
real hope of success. So I think there is a big

40:40.116 --> 40:52.512
tendency on everyone's part to try to oversell 
because, with the shortage of funds, everybody

40:40.116 --> 40:52.512
feels they've got almost half to oversell in order 
to get funded, and that's unfortunate. I mean,

40:53.048 --> 40:59.758
every one of those programs is a legitimate 
program, and it's a legitimate scientific study.

41:00.920 --> 41:07.690
But I think they probably are oversold in that 
people tend to think that they're going to get

41:00.920 --> 41:07.690
results cheaper and sooner than they really are.

41:10.714 --> 41:14.920
What's, in your opinion, what's the state of 
planetary astronomy today in this country? Plus,

41:15.862 --> 41:16.883
minus, zero? Well, I'm not sure what you mean by 
state. Expanding? idling, sinking? It's

41:24.683 --> 41:25.824
sinking, I think. I don't think there's any 
question of that. The funding for planetary

41:27.526 --> 41:38.857
astronomy has not increased for a decade, and 
there's been no real allowance made for

41:27.526 --> 41:38.857
inflation. I think there's enormous pressure 
from the fact that any university professor is

41:40.158 --> 41:51.068
judged in part by the number of graduates that he 
has and the number of PhDs that he produces, And

41:51.385 --> 42:10.044
you've got to figure if every individual 
planetary astronomer out there in a university

41:51.385 --> 42:10.044
produces even five or six students, and most of 
them, it's probably more like 10 PhDs in the field

41:51.385 --> 42:10.044
during their working lifetime, you can see how 
rapidly the number of people in the field is going

41:51.385 --> 42:10.044
to grow. And each of them in turn then is going to 
have the same problem of getting funding and have

42:10.465 --> 42:17.452
their own students. And so you tend to get an 
exponential growth. And clearly no field can

42:20.647 --> 42:25.073
sustain an exponential growth for a long period of 
time. Planetary astronomy has done it, did it for a

42:25.173 --> 42:33.284
couple of decades, and clearly that has to stop. So 
there's tremendous pressure just from there

42:33.624 --> 42:38.871
being too many people today for the funds that are 
available. And you might argue that that's good

42:39.492 --> 42:45.760
for the field in that you can claim that the very 
best will rise to the top and be funded and But I

42:46.364 --> 42:53.894
think it's not doing any young person a favor to 
take them into planetary astronomy today. At

42:54.014 --> 43:06.210
least you have to be honest and explain the facts of 
life to them that they're going to have to be

42:54.014 --> 43:06.210
awfully good and work awfully hard if they're to 
have any real hope of succeeding in the field. Over

43:06.390 --> 43:10.656
the years, what's JPL's attitude been? Looking at 
it from the bottom, looking up, what do you think

43:10.696 --> 43:14.481
the people... Well, what's the impression you got 
of what's JPL's quote-unquote attitude towards

43:14.798 --> 43:21.886
planetary astronomy? Necessary evil, an 
ornament, or what? I think the attitude at the lab

43:26.872 --> 43:31.157
has always been fairly good. I think they found 
astronomers to be useful, well, all planetary

43:31.978 --> 43:40.047
scientists, not just astronomers, but all of the 
people in the field to be useful. a useful adjunct

43:40.651 --> 43:46.656
in that they were around to help when questions 
came up on the flight projects. And I think the

43:46.696 --> 43:54.964
feeling has been that the science produced here 
has been of sufficient quality for JPL to be quite

43:46.696 --> 43:54.964
proud of it. And I think the attitude of senior 
management at the lab towards science has always

43:56.825 --> 44:01.770
been good. It's never been, of course, their 
fundamental goal. Their fundamental goal has

44:04.192 --> 44:09.156
always been and remains to sell new projects. So 
while I think the scientists are respected and

44:12.807 --> 44:29.346
have a place, everybody feels they have a place 
here, that place is not going to be allowed to

44:12.807 --> 44:29.346
interfere in any way with the lab's chief goals, 
which are to fly missions. Do you think there's

44:29.366 --> 44:38.637
enough support for ground-based work as opposed 
to the money spent on probes by NASA?

44:41.468 --> 45:04.714
I have to say no, in a way, in the sense that if you 
actually look at the dollars spent on probes

44:41.468 --> 45:04.714
through the last couple of decades and the dollars 
spent supporting ground-based work, the amount

44:41.468 --> 45:04.714
of knowledge that we've gained from the 
ground-based work is far larger proportionally

44:41.468 --> 45:04.714
than the money spent on it. And as long as that 
continues to happen, then one has to argue that

45:09.498 --> 45:12.783
Perhaps there should be more funding for the 
ground-based work. You're getting more bang for

45:13.864 --> 45:16.828
buck out of the ground-based stuff. Now clearly 
there are many things that you cannot do from the

45:16.888 --> 45:20.293
ground. You could never have done without the 
probes. And so I'm not arguing to dismantle one in

45:24.018 --> 45:27.864
favor of the other. I'm simply saying that I think 
perhaps their balance has always been a little bit

45:27.924 --> 45:33.231
off. They get a lot of good data. And then they have a 
brief research and analysis program on that data.

45:40.201 --> 45:48.390
And before the treasure trove that they've gained 
with a probe is really worked out, the research

45:40.201 --> 45:48.390
program is cut off and they go on to something else. 
And I think that's short-sighted. And I think

45:51.733 --> 46:02.585
similarly, the actual support of ground-based 
observations has been a little lacking in, well, I

45:51.733 --> 46:02.585
think the balance is a little off. Let me put it that 
way.
