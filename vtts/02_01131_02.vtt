WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:05.364
So anyway, if we could begin. You just sort of 
introduce yourself, and you don't need to talk

00:07.527 --> 00:10.371
into the mic. It's real good. It picks up all kinds 
of stuff. It picks up right there. OK, my name is

00:13.916 --> 00:15.018
Bill Kendrick. I was raised in central part of 
Texas, up near Burnett. I went to Southwest Texas

00:22.809 --> 00:25.954
State in San Marcos. And after that, I got a job with 
the Soil Conservation Service. What did you major

00:30.278 --> 00:31.800
in? In agronomy. And when I worked for the Soil 
Conservation Service, I was in the position of a

00:34.224 --> 00:41.174
soil scientist. And we did... When was this? When 
did you go to school? When did you graduate? This

00:47.720 --> 00:52.726
was in the mid-60s, 65, 66. Oh, but I knew the deputy 
director of the soil conservation service for a

00:52.746 --> 01:05.222
very long time, Jeff Dykes, who, I don't know 
whether you knew him or not, he was from

00:52.746 --> 01:05.222
Washington, D.C. Old egg. No, I guess I knew him. I 
was working up in... He retired maybe about the

01:08.506 --> 01:10.629
time you joined. I was working up in Comanche. 
county doing a progressive soil survey of that

01:13.910 --> 01:43.056
county and it was in the late 60s i guess by that time 
i'd been with the service about seven years that

01:13.910 --> 01:43.056
they were getting to to formulate the woodlands 
and put it together and the environmental

01:13.910 --> 01:43.056
planners uh particularly when you talk about that 
you think of ian mccard right that wrote the book

01:13.910 --> 01:43.056
design with nature they wanted One of the things 
that they needed was the soils information. And so

01:48.831 --> 02:09.049
being the young progressive soil scientist, I 
guess, up in Comanche County, the Soil

01:48.831 --> 02:09.049
Conservation Service was looking for someone to 
come to the woodlands, at that time we're talking

01:48.831 --> 02:09.049
about 20,000 acres, and be a party leader to map out 
the existing soils that occurred in the

01:48.831 --> 02:09.049
woodlands. So as part of the environmental impact 
statement and part of the original HUD HUD

02:13.647 --> 02:16.391
application and part of that plan. So I got 
selected to come down and it was kind of an unusual

02:17.552 --> 02:35.136
agreement that the federal government could not 
go and do work on private lands and do a survey that

02:17.552 --> 02:35.136
had already been completed at a larger scale as 
part of the Montgomery County soil survey. So what

02:35.997 --> 02:40.583
they did, they kind of contracted us through the 
local salt and water conservation district And we

02:41.963 --> 02:48.410
in turn, through the district, we were able to work 
in the woodlands. So we came in and spent about

02:48.510 --> 02:53.236
almost a year. I guess I moved to Conroe then in 
1972. And we spent about a year in the field mapping

02:56.980 --> 03:10.215
out the different soil types and observing and 
recording the different vegetation types that

02:56.980 --> 03:10.215
was occurring on the soil.

03:12.642 --> 03:25.240
After we finished the field work, at the same time 
we were doing water percolation tests and we had

03:12.642 --> 03:25.240
water table studies where we were doing some 
little shallow wells and doing that. And we were

03:26.322 --> 03:35.535
having visits and corresponding with McCarg and 
his planners, working along with them at the same

03:26.322 --> 03:35.535
time. Then we had to finish up the report after we 
did the field work. And I was finishing that up and

03:43.304 --> 03:51.980
ready to move on to something else, and I was 
offered a job to go work with the Woodlands

03:43.304 --> 03:51.980
Corporation to stay around and help them 
interpret and understand. Who did it? Who offered

03:53.603 --> 03:54.564
me the job. The person who was leading, hitting up 
that part of the planning at the time was James

03:56.608 --> 04:02.038
Beltman, or Jim Beltman. and he was kind of the 
liaison between the corporation and mccard and

04:02.677 --> 04:29.258
his people so he thought i should be part of the team 
to stay around and do that so he offered me a job and

04:02.677 --> 04:29.258
at the time it was a rough decision to give up my 
security of working with the federal government

04:02.677 --> 04:29.258
to come to work with the developer this was about 
when this was in 19 i actually came to work in 1973.

04:02.677 --> 04:29.258
okay You've been here a long time. I've been here a 
long time. The Woodlands didn't open until 1974.

04:35.312 --> 04:52.455
So

04:35.312 --> 04:52.455
I came to work with them and immediately fell into 
the

04:35.312 --> 04:52.455
job of working with the planters and trying to 
explain the different soil types and what we'd

04:35.312 --> 04:52.455
expect from a development. They were concerned 
about runoff and recharge and all those

04:52.475 --> 04:58.924
percolation rate of soils and we did some of that. 
then it was like well you know what am i going to do

04:59.545 --> 05:27.797
now so i got involved in the in the tree 
preservation aspect of the woodlands because of

04:59.545 --> 05:27.797
that earlier experience of mapping out the 
vegetation and having that knowledge of the

04:59.545 --> 05:27.797
different kinds of trees and agronomy knowledge 
so the concern and the challenge from mr mitchell

04:59.545 --> 05:27.797
from the early days was to develop a new town and not 
disturb the character of the forest which meant

05:28.655 --> 05:32.740
that we were going to try to save every tree we 
possibly could. We were not going to destroy what

05:33.801 --> 05:45.055
we call the understory of the big trees, the canopy 
trees with the overstory and everything

05:33.801 --> 05:45.055
underneath was the understory. The brush. Where 
you get your screen and where you get your

05:46.858 --> 05:56.470
flowering plants like dogwoods and sassafras and 
all that kind of thing. So that was... I think one of

05:58.287 --> 06:05.234
the most significant, from the appearance of the 
Woodlands today, I think that was a significant

05:58.287 --> 06:05.234
decision. It was not going to be a park-like 
environment where you go in and just leave the

06:05.254 --> 06:12.521
mature trees and clear the understory. And based 
on the premise that we were going to try to utilize

06:13.342 --> 06:24.092
the natural forest as much as we could, so it's a lot 
cheaper and it just makes more sense to to save what

06:24.832 --> 06:38.672
you have, groom and prune and work with that and 
replace with native plant material as opposed to

06:24.832 --> 06:38.672
cut everything down and bring in something 
completely foreign and plastic looking and plant

06:24.832 --> 06:38.672
that. So, you know, it's working with the existing 
plant. So I was given the job of the tree keeper and

06:41.577 --> 06:49.388
so I ended up working with the individual builders 
that came to the Woodlands and we actually went out

06:49.688 --> 07:02.065
and required the builders to outline the 
footprint, whether it was a single family or

06:49.688 --> 07:02.065
whether it was a commercial structure, to outline 
the footprint. If they were going to clear, then

07:02.085 --> 07:04.849
we... They'd actually stake it out? Stake out the 
footprint and the driveway and with a continuous

07:06.110 --> 07:13.941
ribbon all the way around and then we would either 
approve or disapprove an issue of clearing permit

07:14.748 --> 07:20.335
if everything was properly marked out. And we 
would make decisions at that time, can we shift the

07:21.175 --> 07:28.884
house to the front or to the rear, and can we move 
things over to save a few trees. So we were

07:28.904 --> 07:42.240
successful in saving a lot of trees simply because 
of offsets in the house that maybe they didn't take

07:28.904 --> 07:42.240
advantage of, or maybe flipping and putting the 
driveway on the other side and doing those kinds of

07:28.904 --> 07:42.240
things. and but once we said okay now you can clear 
so they go in and they get so bad it's it's always

07:43.199 --> 08:07.283
been rewarded for being as as fast and as reckless 
as you can the fact you clear the better you are the

07:43.199 --> 08:07.283
dozer operator the dozer operator so uh he just 
started falling trees and they were going outside

07:43.199 --> 08:07.283
the ribbon and everywhere so we had a real 
education process with all the subcontractors in

08:08.107 --> 08:31.482
the woodlands as to how we wanted them to try to 
protect the forest it was they were just not

08:08.107 --> 08:31.482
accustomed to doing anything that drastic but 
tedious as far as keeping let me explore that just a

08:08.107 --> 08:31.482
little bit um manifestly what you're talking 
about is something well in fact what you're saying

08:08.107 --> 08:31.482
is this was not a normal way of doing business. 
Usually when a builder goes in, it's his

08:33.743 --> 08:42.895
convenience to serve first in terms of building a 
home, because that lowers his costs, that he can do

08:33.743 --> 08:42.895
it more efficiently. Do strip clearing and build a 
pad. And from here's point of view, even more

08:46.720 --> 08:50.205
effectively, really, than what you're 
suggesting. So that education process had to be

08:50.866 --> 08:56.974
fairly formable, I would think. Could you explain 
a little bit about one how that education process

09:01.955 --> 09:07.824
developed, the role you played in it, to how 
successful it was. Was there a builder fallout?

09:09.546 --> 09:14.273
Were there some builders that said, I ain't going 
to do this, and wandered off? Were there times

09:16.256 --> 09:23.947
when, in fact,

09:16.256 --> 09:23.947
you mentioned that you gave them approval. What 
happened when they didn't get approval? Builders

09:27.693 --> 09:31.118
sometimes work on a very marginal kind of profit. 
Delays, what have you, could seriously disrupt or

09:31.722 --> 09:38.850
affect their success? How did you deal with those 
kinds of things? I guess the most beneficial two we

09:43.134 --> 09:49.842
had to work with was as the different sections were 
developed. They were described and they were so

09:49.862 --> 09:59.552
under covenant that the the development criteria 
for that section spelled out that the vegetation

10:01.810 --> 10:07.419
would be preserved. It was kind of a binding 
agreement with them. We had a lot of problems with

10:12.066 --> 10:19.057
the builders who were coming out of Houston in the 
1960s and coming out here and they'd never done

10:12.066 --> 10:19.057
things like this before. They didn't like the 
delays. They didn't like putting up the fencing.

10:25.707 --> 10:28.071
We had a lot of real heated arguments with some of 
the builders to the point where, you know, they

10:28.338 --> 10:31.942
just almost want to fight. They'd get so mad at you. 
And we ended up kind of having a, taken back through

10:34.424 --> 10:39.129
DSC. They had a committee called DSC, which was 
Development Standards Committee. Yeah. That

10:43.274 --> 10:49.540
approved the single family plans and that aspect. 
And there were many meetings where we would, it had

10:49.560 --> 10:57.248
the support of management, what we were trying to 
do. And we would have meetings where we would

10:57.683 --> 11:08.837
present, maybe I would put together a slide show 
and those kind of things, and we would meet and

10:57.683 --> 11:08.837
present it to the builders. We would not only 
present it to the builders, but we'd present it to

11:09.518 --> 11:14.584
their people that they used as landscape. You 
know, we'd invite all of the landscape people and

11:14.744 --> 11:25.277
all of the builders and all of the cleanup men, 
which probably had more decision than any of us in

11:14.744 --> 11:25.277
what it actually looked like in the end. actually 
doing the cleanup and putting down the saw and

11:26.303 --> 11:29.346
doing the grading. You know, the lowest paid 
person on the staff was the one that was making the

11:29.526 --> 11:37.133
final decision as to the survival of my little 
wishes, the brush. But it was that kind of, those

11:38.494 --> 11:50.165
kind of meetings, and again, it had support of Mr. 
Mitchell on down, and that was what the Williams

11:38.494 --> 11:50.165
was going to do like, you know. And it was basically 
just, you know, either build like we want you to

11:50.185 --> 11:55.409
build or go somewhere else, you know. It was kind of 
a... the builders were, we weren't just selling

11:56.763 --> 12:04.070
lots to everyone, you know, it was kind of a select 
group of people that were here. They had to have a

12:04.110 --> 12:09.075
track record proving, you know, they built a good 
house and those kind of things. So it was a good

12:09.235 --> 12:11.457
situation to be in. I felt like we always had the 
upper hand and had control. If they over cleared,

12:15.461 --> 12:19.345
then we tried to force them to replant. And it was a 
lot of have so far involved when you didn't abide by

12:22.953 --> 12:49.804
the rules we required after clearing after you got 
to that point then you had all the subcontractors

12:22.953 --> 12:49.804
that want to go through the woods and tear up the 
forest so we found out we can't have that because

12:22.953 --> 12:49.804
we're not going to have anything so we required 
them to put up in the early days in this training

12:22.953 --> 12:49.804
process this is like in the 70s or not mid 70s this is 
some of the first homes we built down in all across

12:51.826 --> 12:56.630
some settler's corner town halls where the first 
models of the woodlands were that I'm thinking

12:51.826 --> 12:56.630
about. We required them to put up fencing right 
inside that envelope. And they didn't want to do

13:03.577 --> 13:06.139
that. In some cases we actually went in and put up 
the fence ourselves to help protect the

13:06.540 --> 13:19.692
vegetation of the first models that we built to 
make the point that we were trying to get across.

13:19.712 --> 13:20.753
And We were successful in doing that. And once, 
after they built the homes there and they got rid of

13:24.082 --> 13:45.440
the landscape, we insisted, too, on approval of 
the landscape plan so that they would maintain the

13:24.082 --> 13:45.440
natural character again, use, you know, 
indigenous plants or use native plants that would

13:24.082 --> 13:45.440
fit in and texture and blend in with the existing 
mature trees that were there. So, you know, when

13:46.041 --> 13:50.605
the models opened, we were all very proud of the way 
they looked. literally just tucked into the woods

13:50.804 --> 14:20.743
at the end of a cul-de-sac and it was very popular a 
lot of people really liked that concept but there

13:50.804 --> 14:20.743
were still those in the sales force and they were 
skeptical about what it would really working on

13:50.804 --> 14:20.743
you know the place looked like it's not being 
maintained it looks like we need to mow along with

13:50.804 --> 14:20.743
the streets and anytime the sales were down they 
always blamed it on signage and landscape you know

13:50.804 --> 14:20.743
that was why we were not selling homes I mean first 
impressions. First impression that you get when

14:22.316 --> 14:24.739
you come into the Woodlands. But Mr. Mitchell was 
very persistent about that was what the Woodlands

14:26.021 --> 14:48.435
was going to be like and we were going to save the 
forest and so the problem you had then was once you

14:26.021 --> 14:48.435
sell that home to someone he wants to come in and 
because of that nature and that natural instinct

14:26.021 --> 14:48.435
to get out and and clear his block of land and 
develop the way he's always seen it with St.

14:48.635 --> 14:56.103
Augustine grass and curb appeal to my house. The 
first weekend is there, he takes his saw, his

14:56.483 --> 15:07.634
machete, and he comes down and he wants to chop up 
everything that we've been beating the builders

14:56.483 --> 15:07.634
over the head about for five, six months to save. He 
clears it out the first weekend and puts it on the

15:08.155 --> 15:14.261
curb and gets someone to haul it off the next week. 
So we thought, how do we overcome that one? We

15:17.086 --> 15:24.076
actually went around in the early days and visited 
with the residents. We'd have native landscape

15:24.096 --> 15:30.185
seminars for all the residents of the woodlands. 
In the early days we had a wildflower conference, I

15:30.205 --> 15:40.140
think we called it, where we would put people on bus 
tours and drive them around. and identify

15:40.829 --> 15:45.855
wildflowers to build that kind of interest that 
you had. And it was, you know, those that were very,

15:46.576 --> 15:55.947
the little ladies in tennis shoes and the very 
ecology-minded people were the easiest ones to

15:46.576 --> 15:55.947
sell. But those that had prior homes and lived in a 
more suburban area were the most difficult to

15:56.388 --> 16:03.796
sell. And, you know, our theory was that if you 
could just get someone to, you know, to wait a

16:03.816 --> 16:09.283
season before you chop anything down and be inside 
your glass home and look out like we're looking out

16:09.652 --> 16:24.925
now into this area and watch it change through the 
seasons and watch the flowering of the dogwoods

16:09.652 --> 16:24.925
and the berries, the beauty berries and all those 
things develop. Then you develop that

16:24.945 --> 16:28.488
appreciation for it. And we always insisted 
everyone go through the information center,

16:28.508 --> 16:36.655
which is a multimedia presentation on that one. 
And we developed a nature trail by the information

16:39.250 --> 16:55.521
center also and we had a brochure that went along 
with the trail and it was open to all the residents

16:39.250 --> 16:55.521
and it explained our concept for development and 
how important it was to keep it foraged and how But,

16:55.940 --> 17:02.589
you know, so many trees in front of your house 
increase the value 27%, you know, a lot of value.

17:03.410 --> 17:07.936
And how important it was to the environment and to 
the birds and the wildlife and all that. And let

17:07.956 --> 17:15.306
them begin to identify the trees and there was a 
posted number and it told you the common and

17:07.956 --> 17:15.306
botanical name. And just try to instill that sense 
of real feeling that we had about how important it

17:16.007 --> 17:23.837
was to development. Keep that character. Yeah, I 
appreciate it. Do you know...

17:31.488 --> 17:34.653
I forgot how to ask this question.

17:39.039 --> 17:49.294
Playing devil's advocate, let's say I move here 
from East Orange,

17:39.039 --> 17:49.294
New Jersey. For whatever reasons, I buy... home or 
buy a lot in the woodlands and build on it. And then

17:59.645 --> 18:10.441
Bill Kendrick or somebody comes and tells me about 
how I should be landscaping it.

18:10.461 --> 18:16.170
With certain kinds of personalities, there might 
be some resistance to anyone telling me what to do

18:10.461 --> 18:16.170
with my land. You know what I'm saying? Exactly.

18:23.588 --> 18:44.098
How many, I guess, of the people you talked to were, 
to borrow a religious phrase, converted to Mr.

18:23.588 --> 18:44.098
Mitchell's vision versus those who said, I ain't 
going to do it, versus those who said, we moved and

18:23.588 --> 18:44.098
then went somewhere else. Do you understand what 
I'm saying? How successful, I guess I'm trying to

18:46.661 --> 18:49.225
ask, was that? a combination of educational slash 
propagandizing, and I mean that in a positive

18:50.977 --> 18:59.186
sense, effort. Do you have any feel for that at all? 
Well, I think the best way to answer the question,

19:02.810 --> 19:08.536
if you could, the village of Grover's Mill was the 
first one we did. And if you could drive back

19:08.556 --> 19:19.228
through Grover's Mill in sections one, two, 
three, four, five, six, and seven, you know, those

19:08.556 --> 19:19.228
are the first ones. You can't see the houses where 
the trees. I mean, it's literally very

19:22.116 --> 19:25.021
successful. There was always a few. And that's 
true in any situation. But I'd say 90% successful.

19:35.396 --> 19:39.462
To me, success meant if you drove down the street 
There was always a native look to the landscaping.

19:45.499 --> 19:47.963
The mature trees were there, there was a certain 
amount of understory. I consider we were

19:48.745 --> 20:02.007
successful if we had a natural block of forest 
opposite side of the driveway that was not

19:48.745 --> 20:02.007
completely destroyed and cleared out and 
installed to St. Augustine grass.

20:03.286 --> 20:11.235
They enjoyed, I think, the privacy that you get 
from leaving it in the backyard so you don't see

20:03.286 --> 20:11.235
your neighbor's swing set, so you don't see a row of 
houses. It's kind of that little secluded bit of

20:11.716 --> 20:15.080
privacy that you get. What you have to remember, 
things were a little bit slow in those days in 74.

20:20.786 --> 20:23.289
They weren't a little bit slow. They were real 
slow. It's almost like you built a new town but no

20:24.350 --> 20:26.753
one came. So you had the opportunity to work. 
one-on-one with a homeowner, art builder, and

20:30.387 --> 20:37.136
you're not in the fast pace that you're in today. So 
you're able to spend more time with them and then do

20:38.198 --> 20:46.229
a better job of that conversion experience that 
we're talking about. Does that still continue

20:46.970 --> 20:48.432
today? Are you still doing this in 1991? It's still 
just as important to Mr. Mitchell and management

20:50.555 --> 20:57.084
as it's ever been. I understand that, but how is it 
accomplished? Today it's, we have a, we don't go

21:00.425 --> 21:08.876
door to door and try to talk to new homeowners. The 
builder still gets beat over the head just as hard

21:09.276 --> 21:13.382
as he ever did about doing his part. We have a, at the 
information center, they hand out a residential

21:15.064 --> 21:22.854
guide to landscaping in the woodlands, something 
we developed to show them how to. May I have this?

21:24.797 --> 21:25.017
Yes. Thank you. How to try to save the, try to save 
the forest.

21:31.610 --> 21:33.593
It's handed out there. There's all kinds of 
information that they get when they move to the

21:34.494 --> 21:38.299
Woodlands. It's like the welcome wagon or the 
newcomer approach to it. It's included in that.

21:45.389 --> 21:49.755
There's still slideshows and presentations to 
landscapers and builders today. And I think

21:50.976 --> 22:01.110
probably more than anything, it's probably 
enforced just the feeling that you get when you

21:50.976 --> 22:01.110
drive into the Woodlands by the people.

22:03.098 --> 22:06.722
The best effort is probably made by the people that 
live here now. Tim probably told you. I sensed

22:08.124 --> 22:09.465
that, yeah. I don't know, I seem like it's, I don't 
remember the number, at least 25 or 30% probably of

22:09.565 --> 22:18.576
the new home sales or referrals from people living 
here now. And it's just a pride that the community

22:18.596 --> 22:21.659
has. I mean, you know, if somebody really get on 
your case now about tearing up trees, it's the

22:21.719 --> 22:29.308
residents against the developer, you know. And 
it's a good position to be in. Tim also mentioned

22:31.627 --> 22:38.398
that just since 1985, over 50% of the builders have 
packed it in and left. So I assume you're having a

22:38.999 --> 22:43.606
continuing education program with those new 
builders as well. Yes, it's always... From day

22:47.733 --> 22:49.836
one, it's been a problem. Not just the builders, 
but from the subcontractors. Those are drivers

22:52.701 --> 22:55.265
that left, you know, or knew and came in. You had to 
go through the same process again. My role has

22:58.190 --> 22:59.272
changed. Now since I'm manager of grounds 
maintenance, I'm not working with the builders or

22:59.352 --> 23:07.665
the residents in that respect. You know, we're 
concentrating on kind of out of that field that

23:07.766 --> 23:12.373
we're talking about. that I wasn't doing at that 
time. I'm doing something different. Well,

23:15.305 --> 23:15.986
that's good. Let's shift gears. What are you doing 
now? How does your role fit? How long have you been

23:20.370 --> 23:23.793
doing this, manager of grounds maintenance? This 
is about the fourth year. It's kind of my five years

23:26.496 --> 23:27.737
now. Okay, okay. Was there a predecessor to you? 
Was it a position created for you? Was there

23:34.603 --> 23:35.444
someone who was... There was someone here, and he 
retired. Oh, okay. So you inherited a... Well,

23:42.138 --> 23:48.008
philosophy obviously has already existed, but 
you inherited some procedures and activities.

23:48.469 --> 24:01.231
What challenges, changes, like I said, 
benchmarks have occurred in the last 10 years in

23:48.469 --> 24:01.231
what is your job? I think one thing I didn't mention 
Now we're involved in not working on individual

24:06.725 --> 24:14.393
lots, but we're working on all the company-owned 
properties, anything the company owns, and we

24:06.725 --> 24:14.393
maintain it. We landscape it. We maintain all of 
the street right-of-ways. And one of the

24:21.521 --> 24:30.150
significant things we've been able to do there is 
the utilization of the natural reforestation,

24:21.521 --> 24:30.150
which simply says that If you've got a grass that 
you're mowing there every day and a little pine

24:31.075 --> 24:39.329
tree sticks its head up and you cut it off, it never 
has an opportunity to grow back. So many areas that

24:39.990 --> 24:51.048
we can, we go in and do a planting of native plant 
material and let Mother Nature come back and heal

24:39.990 --> 24:51.048
those scars. And our concept oversimplified is to 
to hide the unsightly parts and accentuate all the

24:56.877 --> 25:02.185
pluses and the beauty. And that's kind of our, and 
using native plant material, you know, that's our

25:03.406 --> 25:08.494
philosophy. I think one of the most popular things 
we've done is the development of our Woodlands

25:09.615 --> 25:20.050
Wildflower Program that we have. grown to the 
point where this year we probably planted about

25:22.257 --> 25:28.046
$20,000 worth of wildflower seeds. Probably one 
of the biggest plantings that occurs anywhere in

25:28.346 --> 25:32.833
the state of Texas. We bought over, planted about 
2,000 pounds of bluebonnet seed, which is a lot of

25:33.093 --> 25:41.967
bluebonnets. And what we've seen is that has 
really grown in interest. And with Mr. Mitchell's

25:46.614 --> 25:48.737
encouragement, We're not only doing that here in 
the Woodlands, but we're trying to encourage

25:49.527 --> 25:54.773
other people to do this. For instance, the Hardy 
Toll Road, we've gone down and did some plantings

25:55.094 --> 26:01.001
on the Hardy Toll Road. Your office is down there? 
Right. From the Woodlands Corporation. They

26:05.486 --> 26:08.389
provided the seed, and we actually go do the 
planting for them. He asked us to go down to Rice

26:09.751 --> 26:16.699
University, and we did some demonstration 
plantings down there. pray to sow the seed and, you

26:17.050 --> 26:21.176
know, they'll reap the benefits. On the Beltway 8, 
for the Houston Lighting and Power, they provided

26:22.277 --> 26:31.810
the seed and we went and did some plantings 
underneath some of their power lines. There's a

26:31.850 --> 26:33.232
test project. He believes that, you know, if we can 
have other people do what we're doing, from a

26:33.712 --> 26:45.188
natural landscaping, for wildlife programs, 
then we're all the benefit of that. And, um... and

26:46.885 --> 26:48.987
it's been successful. I've got a letter on my desk 
today that came from the Hardy Toll Road. It went to

26:52.930 --> 26:59.016
Mr. Mitchell, thanking him for our efforts in 
establishing the wildfire from Hardy Toll Road.

27:00.597 --> 27:09.425
The company, we also maintain and do work in the 
Galveston area on some of our property as manager

27:00.597 --> 27:09.425
of grounds maintenance. And he's big on getting 
wildfire established in some of the developments

27:09.445 --> 27:15.070
in the Galveston area also. Do you go to Colorado to 
Snowmass? No, I haven't been up there. No, it's

27:19.391 --> 27:26.018
just been in this area.

27:26.038 --> 27:28.461
So that's been a major, obviously a major impetus. 
Right. What other things are hanging out there? If

27:32.866 --> 27:41.175
someone, you know, what I'm looking for, 
obviously, or maybe it's not obvious, but in 20

27:32.866 --> 27:41.175
years people are going to look back and say, boy, 
that really made a difference when we did this or

27:41.527 --> 27:48.377
when we did that or when this was allowed to happen 
or that occurred. What sort of things are going on

27:49.198 --> 28:08.445
and have gone on within the decade of the 80s and 
presently that, you know, the business as usual

27:49.198 --> 28:08.445
stuff, people are going to know about, but what 
changes, what

27:49.198 --> 28:08.445
initiatives

28:13.201 --> 28:19.349
anything, I mean, business as usual has been so 
successful, I really can't think of anything

28:13.201 --> 28:19.349
really new and outstanding that we're doing. Or 
have there been significant challenges to the

28:19.730 --> 28:23.775
business as usual? That have, that have, you know, 
where you've had to, you know, mount troops in

28:23.795 --> 28:28.541
charge? Yeah. Um,

28:31.245 --> 28:40.057
no, just the, um, the size of the jobs that we've had 
to complete. And I think I see a little bit of, um, of

28:43.053 --> 28:44.174
refinement. There's still that battle of

28:45.996 --> 28:56.348
is it properly maintained from a first 
impression, from a buyer's standpoint. I think

28:56.868 --> 29:05.618
there's a little bit of more of a grooming 
appearance, more of a little strip of grass along

28:56.868 --> 29:05.618
the edge of the wood to give you that transition. So 
you kind of lose that weedy look along the edge. I

29:09.825 --> 29:11.166
think that's the trend. We're doing a little bit 
more material. Economics have played into that

29:13.688 --> 29:15.850
too, haven't they? One of the things Tim was 
telling me was that

29:16.050 --> 29:31.464
in the downturn times, 82, 83, 84, 86, through 
there when things were rough, they were selling

29:16.050 --> 29:31.464
300, 400 homes a year or something like that. Now 
they're selling 900,000. And they're looking to

29:32.986 --> 29:35.588
do that in good times. And that they're promoting 
the notion that builders will finish out 600

29:35.872 --> 29:45.564
homes, all within each other. And they want to do 
that as a marketing plan.

29:52.132 --> 29:59.922
Which means that instead of having homes built 
serially, you'll have huge blocks, whole

29:52.132 --> 29:59.922
neighborhoods done. Has that brought distinct 
challenges, different challenges? I think just

30:05.389 --> 30:09.115
in volume of work that we had to do, and the staff 
increase. I mean, my staff has grown from, since

30:09.135 --> 30:20.393
I've been here, from 30 and 35 to, I think we had like 
80 at the peak period this year. And it fluctuates.

30:21.615 --> 30:26.483
We have an average of 55, and this next year I might 
have an average of 60. and just the keeping up with

30:27.188 --> 30:34.237
the staff and the motivation and keeping the 
equipment that you need and just actually getting

30:27.188 --> 30:34.237
the job done. It's just such a, the area's growing. 
Everything we have installed since 1974,

30:36.940 --> 30:45.691
I still have to maintain that, plus everything new 
that we're installing. So it's getting to be big.

30:49.816 --> 30:52.299
It's just geometric increases, right? I think one 
of the things that we're trying to do is to from a

30:56.585 --> 31:03.396
landscape standpoint, are to not install so many 
of those things that are high labor items. I mean,

31:03.657 --> 31:08.485
there's a big issue in management about color or no 
color. If we start installing hundreds of median

31:10.107 --> 31:22.187
tips I have all over the Woodlands now, if I put 
color in those areas, then my staff is going to

31:10.107 --> 31:22.187
probably double just to do the the hand labor 
that's involved in doing that. So, you know, we're

31:26.096 --> 31:30.140
saying stay with native plants, minimum kind of 
maintenance. What color are you talking about?

31:34.064 --> 31:34.424
Annual? Annual color that you'd replace two or 
three times a year based upon the season. And

31:39.530 --> 31:42.012
that's kind of an ongoing battle right now. And I 
think it's... Between whom?

31:48.159 --> 31:49.120
Between... Those of us that are maybe too pure, the 
naturalist versus the sales, the marketing

31:50.028 --> 31:59.919
staff. They're doing it in 1960, so we should be 
doing it out here. Some of us think, well, go to

32:04.865 --> 32:07.188
1960. That's why we're unique is because we're 
different. From little things that we are seeing,

32:13.315 --> 32:19.782
we've picked out a beautiful red maple. okay when 
it had extremely good color and about it and we

32:19.897 --> 32:48.773
we're working with one of the growers and we're 
growing our own calling the woodlands red maple

32:19.897 --> 32:48.773
and we hope to proliferate the woodlands with our 
our red maple and you know someday it may be

32:19.897 --> 32:48.773
something you go to a nursery and buy you know those 
little kind of things are going on but from an

32:19.897 --> 32:48.773
overall standpoint we're we're looking into 
techniques and ways to keep down the maintenance

32:49.732 --> 32:57.322
costs so we can afford to keep doing all the 
maintenance that we are now. Well, that makes

32:57.643 --> 32:59.405
sense from a management point of view. The 
marketers, though, I would imagine, you know, I

32:59.846 --> 33:09.039
mean, I understand or I assume from what you said 
that this battle, to use your words, is not over.

33:09.099 --> 33:10.981
This discussion is ongoing. What if the marketing 
group wins and, in fact, there is color in all the

33:11.602 --> 33:18.051
tips of these things? What will that mean besides 
just more work? I think it would mean more work. I

33:25.188 --> 33:29.975
think it would be, I don't know what the total 
outcome would be. You know, if that was all we did, I

33:30.116 --> 33:34.462
think that we could live through that. My concern 
would be that we'd get to the point someday, if you

33:35.343 --> 33:40.752
let your guard down. I mean, to me, you've got to try 
to save 100% of the trees on the block or the lot that

33:41.232 --> 33:47.802
you're working with. or you won't get them. If you 
try to save 100%, then you may get 50 or 60%. If you

33:54.985 --> 34:00.814
loosen your requirements and you say, well, let's 
strive for 50, you're going to get 25. And my real

34:01.576 --> 34:15.679
concern would be if we ever relaxed our rules, our 
demands on keeping the character of the forest,

34:01.576 --> 34:15.679
that forest is like people, like old people, If you 
just save the big trees, mature trees, you don't

34:16.233 --> 34:28.465
save all of the, to me it's understory and the 
shrubs, and we called it brush earlier, with the

34:16.233 --> 34:28.465
beauty part of the forest, and it's also where 
those child trees and the little trees are coming

34:16.233 --> 34:28.465
along. If you ever get to the point where you say, 
okay, let's mow that and make it look more like a

34:28.785 --> 34:46.122
park as opposed to a living forest, then in time, 
we're going to deplete the forest because old

34:28.785 --> 34:46.122
trees are going to die, and there's not going to be 
anything there to replace it and I think it would be

34:47.063 --> 34:58.813
the most critical error that we could make if we got 
to the point where we actually destroy the

34:47.063 --> 34:58.813
character of our living forest that we have today. 
So you obviously favor a conservative or a

34:59.394 --> 35:11.224
conservationist point of view, let's conserve 
what we have rather than muddy the water with new

34:59.394 --> 35:11.224
introductions and new species. Absolutely, 
absolutely. We might, I think you can have you can

35:16.966 --> 35:43.834
possibly have both if you say okay it's okay we're 
going to touch up the median tips and lightly but

35:16.966 --> 35:43.834
you still got to be just as strong about the forest 
itself I mean a median tip is in the middle of the

35:16.966 --> 35:43.834
road so it's not a great reforestation zone or 
regenerative area where you're you know you're

35:16.966 --> 35:43.834
trying to keep the character of the forest but I 
think once it starts on the if you're relax and it

35:44.185 --> 35:48.470
starts on the median tips and the next thing it's 
going to start is around the office building. I

35:48.971 --> 35:50.492
want them to be able to see my signs. I want them to be 
able to see my building. So we start, it's a

35:52.094 --> 35:54.878
constant battle. We have it with every new 
commercial building. We just had a McDonald's

35:59.603 --> 36:07.452
that they said, you know, you can't have a 
McDonald's if you can't see the sign for 10 miles

35:59.603 --> 36:07.452
away. But it's not. It's not that way. It has a 
low-profile sign, and you have to know where it is

36:11.323 --> 36:15.268
to get there. And to everyone's surprise, 
especially the owner, it's outperforming all the

36:16.189 --> 36:22.195
other McDonald's in the area. So we have that kind 
of debate going on. Are you going to have to,

36:27.241 --> 36:33.408
whenever we get out on I-45, are you going to have to 
be able to see the signs in the commercial part of

36:27.241 --> 36:33.408
the woodlands? We're five miles in both 
directions. Right now we're saying no. But

36:37.645 --> 36:39.087
there's another side to that, too. If you know 
where it is, you're going to come. Because I've

36:40.789 --> 36:46.175
talked to individuals who said that from a 
marketing point of view, and again, it's

36:40.789 --> 36:46.175
marketers. They're the ones who are concerned 
about image as much as you are, only from a

36:46.375 --> 36:50.981
different point of view. One gentleman, I'm 
trying to think who it was.

36:57.428 --> 36:59.651
It may have been Richard Brown. Although I could be 
wrong about that. But anyway, one gentleman I know

37:00.552 --> 37:05.678
mentioned he says one of the mistakes he thinks was 
made was that instead of having a wall of trees on

37:06.333 --> 37:13.320
I-45, that in fact there should have been a peak 
into a lake.

37:16.243 --> 37:17.024
I think there will be. It just hasn't happened. 
Yeah. But he says it should have happened from day

37:19.386 --> 37:22.129
one. That there should have been something 
intriguing from I-45 about the woodlands, rather

37:22.469 --> 37:36.103
than this sort of closed... You know, because the 
forest has two images. They're in constant

37:36.843 --> 37:38.486
conflict. One is the nurturing trees, the 
sheltering canopy, the privacy, the noise

37:39.468 --> 37:49.806
abatement. The other is the forbidding woods. You 
can't see the forest with trees. That's right.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.297
That's where the bears live. That's where the 
wolves live. You know what I'm saying? There's a

37:58.922 --> 38:01.146
forbidding... for some claustrophobic concern 
about it. And the notion was, well, hey, from I-45,

38:06.579 --> 38:11.667
all you see is this wall. And it seems 
impenetrable. And it seems,

38:14.571 --> 38:27.210
or it can seem

38:14.571 --> 38:27.210
daunting, perhaps. Maybe that's not the word. I 
think you might get that sense now as you drive. by

38:31.889 --> 38:33.571
the woodlands on I-45. We don't really see that 
much going on. I think they have tried, we have

38:36.615 --> 38:45.047
tried, we just haven't been able to develop that 
commercial portion of the woodlands. The

38:45.127 --> 38:49.853
population base hasn't been here to get them all 
and those kind of things. But it's right on the

38:49.873 --> 38:52.497
verge of happening. The next few years it's going 
to explode along the entry to I-45. One of the

38:56.682 --> 39:01.609
things you will see there someday will be our 
impression of This is the woodlands, and you're

39:02.298 --> 39:08.564
going to look through the trees or underneath the 
trees and look into that lake that you're talking

39:02.298 --> 39:08.564
about. It's going to be there, and I think it'll be 
well done. The problem, as I see it, is not the view

39:12.088 --> 39:16.071
of the lake. The reason you keep those trees out 
there now and that wall is there is to give you an

39:16.672 --> 39:27.483
option, again, to open up those little peaks so you 
can see in and to hide those cars that are going to be

39:16.672 --> 39:27.483
in front of the mall. And I think that's the 
challenge. is how do we keep it from looking like

39:30.850 --> 39:38.620
the other side of the street where all you see is 
buildings and concrete and asphalt. That's what I

39:38.640 --> 39:40.302
want it to look like. Still be enough of those 
little contiguous pieces of forest even though

39:42.304 --> 39:54.960
there's parking lots and cars and buildings and 
service stations and all those kind of things are

39:42.304 --> 39:54.960
going to be there. It still gives you the warmth of 
the woods when you drive by there, that this is a

39:57.952 --> 40:00.896
rule. What is your personal view on...

40:01.477 --> 40:10.651
What do you call it? Well, take the recent issue 
someone told me about yesterday. The brush is

40:14.216 --> 40:15.258
getting out of hand. You can't see around the 
corners when you come to a traffic intersection.

40:23.350 --> 40:27.756
On one hand, philosophically, we want to create 
the woodsy natural environment. On the other

40:30.543 --> 40:40.353
hand, people who drive in the woodlands can be 
intimidated, as was described to me, when they

40:30.543 --> 40:40.353
can't see traffic coming. That can be a stressful 
rather than a calming effect. Well, if the brush is

40:44.838 --> 40:47.080
getting out of hand, I'm not doing my job. Safety

40:47.140 --> 40:54.047
is something we've been aware of for a long time. 
But it's a historical issue is what this guy was

40:54.162 --> 40:57.445
telling me about. In the early days of the 
woodlands, you probably, there were a lot of

40:57.465 --> 41:03.452
hazardous intersections in the woodlands. But 
since I've been in this position, my goal has been

41:03.472 --> 41:09.638
that you'd be able to see at intersections. I mean, 
we've gone in and we've underbrushed. Is that

41:12.001 --> 41:12.821
written down? Are those kind of criteria codified 
in some way? In the standards or what have you? Or is

41:20.429 --> 41:21.030
that... probably too many too many of the 
standards are floating around in my head or

41:23.086 --> 41:52.536
someone is working for me that this is the way we do 
things and it's not written down I think we're at

41:23.086 --> 41:52.536
the point now we're getting large enough and yeah 
that's probably one of our goals for this year is to

41:23.086 --> 41:52.536
start actually getting in favor of what we're 
doing so if it ever comes to the point where grounds

41:23.086 --> 41:52.536
maintenance is too expensive or it's not going to 
do this and we put it out to bid we need to qualify or

41:52.972 --> 41:56.196
quantify what we're actually doing so that can 
occur. But from a hazardous intersection

41:57.037 --> 42:05.827
standpoint, if we know about them, we take care of 
them immediately because it is going to be a

41:57.037 --> 42:05.827
problem. Well, that's not what the issue I was 
trying to raise. The issue I was trying to raise was

42:07.429 --> 42:14.758
when compromise needs to be made, how is that 
worked out? Who and how and what? That's what I was

42:18.101 --> 42:19.824
trying to get at. Was it, you know, when... The old 
philosophical issue of we want a natural

42:23.093 --> 42:34.444
environment conflicts with other pressing, 
realistic demands. And I just use that brush as an

42:34.845 --> 42:37.047
example. I don't think anyone is going to downplay 
the

42:38.669 --> 42:52.122
involvement and the influence that George 
Mitchell still has. over that issue. It's very

42:57.252 --> 43:03.159
important to him that the woodlands be unique and 
that it maintain the character of the forest. And

43:03.179 --> 43:06.262
he will battle with anyone, you know. And he calls 
me and says they don't want to save it, then tell

43:06.683 --> 43:09.786
them to call me. Oh, he backs you that way? He backs 
you 100% in what we're doing. So I know, and

43:15.312 --> 43:20.438
management knows what he wants. So he's the 
guiding force. I mean, I'm not just out on my own

43:25.281 --> 43:29.067
doing what Bill Kendrick wants to do. I mean, Mr. 
Mitchell is behind me 100%. So those decisions,

43:31.771 --> 43:35.196
basically what you're saying, go all the way up the 
line? Exactly. OK. OK. Let me ask you one other

43:36.157 --> 43:41.726
question. Playing devil's advocate again. I'll 
never use this, but it popped into my head and so I

43:43.849 --> 43:49.497
wanted to ask. You're an agronomist. You'll know 
more about this than I. In my little reading about

43:55.178 --> 44:03.487
woods, trees, forests, they have a life of their 
own. They cycle. And this argument has been in the

44:05.970 --> 44:08.053
news significantly. The Yellowstone burning 
last year in Annapolis is an object lesson in case,

44:08.073 --> 44:15.822
in point, where In fact, environmentalists and 
naturalists split over that issue because some

44:16.291 --> 44:23.117
said, no, this is natural. Fires are a natural way 
of renewing the forest and da, da, da, and what have

44:23.358 --> 44:27.562
you.

44:30.525 --> 44:32.466
But it's not an either-or proposition. It's 
certainly not an either-or proposition here in

44:32.486 --> 44:36.330
the woodlands. What you're doing is not

44:36.350 --> 44:42.636
pure and simple, natural. you are promoting 
certain species, right? Like wildflowers, like

44:48.765 --> 44:57.737
other sorts of things, which in fact may not exist 
natively in the woodlands. You're developing,

44:57.757 --> 45:02.583
like the woodlands red maple that you talked 
about. You're developing other, how does that, or

45:02.603 --> 45:05.527
is that even an issue? Is there a purist can't, Is 
there a more moderate camp? I would sense that Mr.

45:13.020 --> 45:16.164
Mitchell is a bit more moderate in that. He has a 
vision, and he's not particularly intrigued with

45:16.184 --> 45:30.825
the purest, you know, the Sierra Club kind of...

45:16.184 --> 45:30.825
Am I making myself clear? No, I think, if I'm 
understanding the question, I think Mr.

45:30.845 --> 45:40.298
Mitchell's comment to me is to... Don't plant 
anything with native wildflowers. Don't use

45:43.503 --> 45:46.706
anything with native trees as those that grow. 
There's a wide number, probably, you know, 150 or

45:48.808 --> 45:55.335
200 different species of trees that grow into 
woodlands. We're constantly searching

45:55.355 --> 46:02.023
nurseries all over trying to find native plant 
material to purchase to use for landscape. To the

46:03.084 --> 46:07.028
extent that a lot of people are not using them. 
Therefore, there's not a high demand, there's not

46:07.666 --> 46:10.251
a lot of growers. So some of the things that we want 
to use, you literally can't find. Oh, there's more

46:14.058 --> 46:15.640
than used to be. There's been several books 
written. Yeah, a lot more than used to be. But my

46:19.347 --> 46:32.070
question had to, you know, there is a, within the 
environmentalist conservationist

46:19.347 --> 46:32.070
discussion, or national forum, whatever you want 
to call it, there are, as there are in any other

46:32.303 --> 46:51.887
There are sort of right-wingers and 
left-wingers, and I don't know which is which, but

46:32.303 --> 46:51.887
what I'm saying is there are people who view 
natural habitats as, in fact, an ecosystem unto

46:32.303 --> 46:51.887
itself that

46:32.303 --> 46:51.887
if a pine beetle comes in and eats all your beetles, 
hey, that's what happens. That something else

46:52.648 --> 46:54.851
naturally will replace it. That forests 
themselves, that pines are not a climax forest.

47:01.430 --> 47:01.790
True. You know, in fact, the climax, you know, the 
stages of Forest of Others, I guess what I'm

47:02.151 --> 47:08.237
talking about.

47:11.060 --> 47:11.720
Is that an issue? Has that ever been an issue? Could 
it be an issue? I haven't seen it as an issue. I think

47:18.927 --> 47:26.695
the forest, like you said, is ever-changing, and 
the first thing that happens is the pine.
