00:03.794 --> 00:17.655
This is an interview with Lynn Bond, Lieutenant 
Colonel, United States Marine Corps, retired by

00:03.794 --> 00:17.655
Shannon Bond on April 3, 1993, at his home in 
Richardson, Texas, concerning his involvement

00:03.794 --> 00:17.655
in the Vietnam War. In the interest of 
accumulating knowledge, I'm asking you to donate

00:17.695 --> 00:26.829
this tape to me or to the Texas A&M Oral History 
Collection in the University Archives. Is that

00:27.050 --> 00:28.051
all right with you? It's perfectly all right. OK. 
Start out with, could you please Tell us your date

00:32.313 --> 00:34.636
and place of birth. I was born in Bullard, Texas, 
June the 18th, 1932. And tell us about your

00:42.047 --> 00:44.751
educational background. I attended grade school 
and high school in Bullard, and I graduated from

00:45.913 --> 00:57.409
Bullard High School in 1949 and joined

00:45.913 --> 00:57.409
the Marine Corps at that point. I subsequently 
attended night school and obtained roughly two

00:58.857 --> 01:07.066
years of college in night school. And that's the 
extent of my formal education. OK. Why did you

01:11.471 --> 01:15.155
enlist in the Marine Corps to begin with? I'm not 
really sure. I think it was probably twofold. One,

01:19.920 --> 01:27.328
at that time, we were about to enter into a 
depression type economic period. It was very hard

01:29.578 --> 01:30.799
to get a job. I did not have good enough grades to get 
a scholarship to college and would have had a great

01:32.681 --> 01:45.473
deal of trouble supporting myself and paying for 
college at the same time. So, one, I wanted to be

01:46.734 --> 01:57.163
covered under the GI Bill, which still was in force 
from World War II at that time, and Secondly, I

01:57.532 --> 01:59.635
really didn't know what I wanted to do. And so it was 
kind of on a lark that a friend of mine one day says,

02:01.037 --> 02:10.549
why don't we join the Marine Corps? And so we went to 
Tyler, joined, was supposed to come back the next

02:10.569 --> 02:19.381
day to go to boot camp. I came back. He didn't. So I 
wound up going by myself. OK. How did you wind up in

02:28.109 --> 02:32.134
Vietnam?

02:32.154 --> 02:35.238
Well, I volunteered to go to Vietnam. In 1967, I 
completed Amphibious Warfare School at

02:35.258 --> 02:43.268
Quantico, Virginia. I was a major at that time. 
And,

02:45.390 --> 02:49.976
well, it was the thing to do. We were fairly heavily 
engaged at that time, and it was being escalated,

02:54.721 --> 03:00.629
the number of forces that was going. So I 
volunteered to go. It's kind of academic. They

03:03.733 --> 03:14.447
would have sent me sooner or later anyway, because 
the requirements for forces had reached the point

03:03.733 --> 03:14.447
where everybody was going to go sooner or later. 
But I wanted to go. I believed that what we were

03:18.813 --> 03:23.479
doing was just, was right and of course I don't 
think you could be a good Marine or a good soldier

03:24.083 --> 03:36.419
and not want to be involved in whatever was going on 
with your country. So I vowed there. Okay.

03:41.827 --> 03:44.550
Were you surprised by the Tet Offensive and why or 
why not? Yes, very much so.

03:51.660 --> 03:53.382
Just prior to the Tet Offensive, My battalion, 2nd 
Battalion, 26 Marines, had responsibility for

03:54.644 --> 04:18.925
the Hue Phu Bai area and for the main road that led 
from, actually, I think it goes from well up in the

03:54.644 --> 04:18.925
North Vietnam all the way down to Saigon. We had 
responsibility for about 50 kilometers of road

04:24.007 --> 04:33.180
which included Hue Phu Bai, which is one of the 
major cities in, let's say, central Vietnam. And

04:33.200 --> 04:41.872
there was not very much activity as far as the Viet 
Cong was concerned at that time. But about three

04:42.333 --> 04:51.145
weeks before the Tet Offensive, my battalion was 
given orders to move up to the northeast

04:54.010 --> 05:01.859
anchor on the DMZ, not on the DMZ, it's been so long 
now I'm having trouble remembering some of these

04:54.010 --> 05:01.859
places. I had to, it was Hoang Song, it was a line 
that went across Vietnam which was known at that

05:03.000 --> 05:13.872
time as the McNamara Line. And we were ordered up to 
that location I took half of the battalion and

05:22.208 --> 05:33.405
started up there and just before we reached that 
point they changed our orders and sent us to Khe

05:22.208 --> 05:33.405
Sanh. So actually I spent the entire Tet Offensive 
in Khe Sanh. While the Tet Offensive was going on

05:40.837 --> 05:50.832
primarily in Hue Phu Bai and in Saigon, they also 
made a major effort to capture Khe Sanh. Now Khe

05:55.019 --> 06:18.945
Sanh is on the western part of Vietnam over near the 
Laotian border and so I spent the siege of Khe Sanh

05:55.019 --> 06:18.945
there but yes the activities around Hue Phu Bai 
which I was the most familiar with was very light

05:55.019 --> 06:18.945
and so the the Tet Offensive of 68 67, 68 came as 
quite a surprise to me. Okay, you've already

06:26.707 --> 06:42.404
mentioned Khe Sanh and understand that the siege 
was just involved some very fierce fighting and

06:26.707 --> 06:42.404
there's been stories of conditions on the North 
Vietnamese side being so bad that they had to eat

06:26.707 --> 06:42.404
rats and things like that. Tell me about Khe Sanh 
all that you can. Well, I don't know anything about

06:46.208 --> 06:47.970
the the Vietnamese portion of that. First, I think 
you should realize that a person's views of any

06:52.180 --> 07:04.453
combat situation is very, very subjective. My 
views is going to be different from anyone else's.

07:09.198 --> 07:12.762
That doesn't make mine right, nor does it make the 
other people's wrong. It is my personal opinion.

07:16.368 --> 07:27.760
that there has been more pure garbage written 
about Vietnam than probably any other war that

07:16.368 --> 07:27.760
ever was fought.

07:29.662 --> 07:44.637
I know we used to get reports and I would get letters 
and so forth about from home about how bad

07:29.662 --> 07:44.637
everything was in Khe Sanh and so forth and what all 
was going on about how the Vietnamese were

07:29.662 --> 07:44.637
tunneling under our lines, and so on and so forth. 
And it was pure hogwash.

07:51.413 --> 08:09.069
The siege of Quezon was primarily a situation 
where they sat and pounded us with rockets and

07:51.413 --> 08:09.069
artillery for, oh, I don't know, 70 or 80 days, 
something along those lines. And we did sit there

08:09.769 --> 08:14.353
and were pounded. in a terrible way for this period 
of time.

08:21.965 --> 08:23.047
But we were dug in. Everybody was in trenches and 
bunkers that had overhead protection and that

08:24.649 --> 08:40.274
included runway matting with sand bags on top of 
it. Generally speaking there was very little need

08:43.561 --> 08:47.487
to get out of your bunker. So we simply sat there. 
And they simply fired their artillery and so

08:51.353 --> 08:53.977
forth. The truth of the matter is, it was not 
extremely effective.

09:01.610 --> 09:11.425
We had the 1st Battalion 9th Marines, the 3rd 
Battalion 26th Marines, Well, 1st, 2nd, 3rd

09:12.907 --> 09:20.135
Battalion, the 26th Marines were all at Khe Sanh 
and reinforced by the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines.

09:20.836 --> 09:33.590
There was also Army Special Forces there who had 
their positions actually set up outside of the Khe

09:20.836 --> 09:33.590
Sanh Combat Bay. Now, a portion of the 2nd 
Battalion, 26th Marines later left the combat

09:40.497 --> 09:48.665
base and went into a blocking position about five 
or six kilometers north of the base. We also had a

09:50.207 --> 09:58.896
reinforced rifle company that was on a hill north, 
northwest of the base. And the 3rd Battalion, 26

10:00.518 --> 10:08.766
Marines, had a company that was on, I believe it was 
Hill 881, but I I don't recall a lot of this. Now,

10:12.340 --> 10:32.370
there were times when our units that were on the 
hills, 881 and I believe it was 812, their

10:12.340 --> 10:32.370
positions were attacked several times by some 
rather significant forces. But the main combat

10:33.392 --> 10:36.897
base, only had minor probes as far as infantry 
attacks on the base is concerned. Everything else

10:44.606 --> 10:53.658
was just pure artillery and rocket attacks, which 
were quite severe for many, many days. And so that

10:54.639 --> 11:00.888
was hard on the troops, but it really wasn't a big 
deal.

11:03.231 --> 11:04.112
How many was out there? I don't know.

11:08.095 --> 11:15.487
They told us at varying times that there was 
probably as many as 50,000 North Vietnamese. And

11:15.587 --> 11:19.012
these were North Vietnamese, not Viet Cong. These 
were North Vietnamese troops. But we had

11:22.157 --> 11:35.959
one battalion and one battery of artillery inside 
the combat base. All of our other artillery

11:36.935 --> 11:47.386
support came from Camp Carroll, which was, oh, 
about 10, 15,000 meters away. But we had all the air

11:49.187 --> 12:02.781
support that anyone could ever ask for to include 
B-29s, which we never asked for, but on several

11:49.187 --> 12:02.781
occasions were directed to use. So we had to come up 
with targets for B-29s. And when told that we

12:07.478 --> 12:25.420
really didn't have any targets for B-29, we were 
told to select them because LBJ, that's

12:07.478 --> 12:25.420
president, had said that he is going to do 
everything humanly possible to see to it that we

12:07.478 --> 12:25.420
were not overrun. Now, they were indicating that 
it was imminent that the combat base would be

12:25.621 --> 12:33.711
overrun by the day. We never felt that it would be.

12:37.769 --> 12:50.220
They gave us intelligence reports at varying 
times that there

12:37.769 --> 12:50.220
would be an armored attack by the North 
Vietnamese. And they

12:51.682 --> 12:59.349
tried to make it look like it was a lot worse than it 
really was. Had there been an armored attack of any

13:00.430 --> 13:06.375
significance, we might have had a problem. If my 
memory serves me correctly, we had a sum total of

13:07.165 --> 13:10.608
five tanks.

13:13.931 --> 13:31.587
And

13:13.931 --> 13:31.587
other than that, each battalion had a 106 
recoil-less rifle, platoon, and of course, each

13:13.931 --> 13:31.587
infantry company has 3.5 rockets, which are 
anti-tank weapons. But a concerted armored

13:32.488 --> 13:35.991
attack. And they could have indeed overrun the 
base because we had inadequate armor. And if they

13:45.580 --> 13:55.835
selected to do this at a time when the air could not 
have been used, then they could have overrun the

13:45.580 --> 13:55.835
base. Now, the weather up there at that time was 
such that often you could not use air until noon.

14:07.358 --> 14:10.623
because of the fog and so forth. But I think the 
severity of the action around Quezon, for the most

14:10.643 --> 14:36.859
part, other than the fact that they used their 
artillery to pound us for a long time, has probably

14:10.643 --> 14:36.859
been grossly overstated.

14:38.763 --> 14:41.907
What impact do you feel that firepower had on the 
war?

14:45.091 --> 14:53.522
Well, first of all,

14:45.091 --> 14:53.522
I assume you mean from both sides here.

14:56.306 --> 14:57.808
We had superior firepower. There's no question 
about it. Except at that particular place and at

15:00.451 --> 15:04.256
that particular time. They had amassed more 
rockets and artillery than what we had. As I

15:12.604 --> 15:21.655
indicated, the only artillery that we had was a 
reinforced artillery battalion. It was a 105

15:21.675 --> 15:27.081
battalion reinforced with one battery of 155 
howitzers. We could get 175 support from Camp

15:28.163 --> 15:32.347
Carroll. Then everything else we got in the way of 
firepower had to be air. This was at a time that

15:39.580 --> 15:50.891
our all-weather capability was not quite as good 
as a lot of people thought it was. So during periods

15:52.172 --> 16:01.181
of reduced visibility, your air support was 
somewhat questionable. And this was also before

16:01.981 --> 16:07.967
we started using our so-called smart bomb. They 
were everything we used up until this point was

16:08.960 --> 16:14.327
dumb bombs. And when you're using dumb bombs, you 
don't get anywhere near the effectiveness that a

16:15.148 --> 16:28.044
lot of people would have you believe. But we, well, 
first of all, they had no air in South Vietnam. To

16:37.529 --> 16:43.056
the best of my knowledge, they never used air 
against our infantry forces. I know they didn't

16:43.336 --> 16:48.743
against us, and to the best of my knowledge, they 
never did against any US ground forces. We had

16:50.225 --> 16:58.656
such vast air superiority that it was just no 
contest. And we were able to use it quite

17:00.779 --> 17:05.545
effectively, but the Vietnamese soldier, 
Totally different from the U.S. soldier. He was

17:11.957 --> 17:33.128
not as well trained in many, many ways, but he was 
far more disciplined in that he would dig tunnels,

17:11.957 --> 17:33.128
he would dig trenches and so forth that would give 
him more protection. And as a result, you might

17:34.718 --> 17:44.988
think that you had done a tremendous amount of 
damage in an artillery barrage or in an airstrike,

17:34.718 --> 17:44.988
and come to find out, you really hadn't. I mean, 
when the smoke cleared up and you'd go back into

17:45.008 --> 17:52.835
that area, you'd find that he's still there and was 
ready to fight. But the

17:52.855 --> 18:03.325
firepower was the deciding factor in our side of 
the thing. But when they decided that they wanted

18:08.250 --> 18:16.418
to stay and fight, they could stay and fight with 
the best of them. The oriental, not the oriental,

18:16.919 --> 18:25.047
yeah, I guess the oriental soldier is very, very 
disciplined. And he will stay and do what he's

18:25.067 --> 18:27.810
told. The Chinese communists in Korea were a lot 
like that. They lost a lot of men, but losing a lot of

18:33.241 --> 18:37.046
men was no big deal to them. You could wipe out a 
battalion and they'd simply send another

18:39.368 --> 18:47.839
battalion up and it didn't bother them. They 
didn't have a situation where the mothers and

18:48.019 --> 18:55.388
fathers at home got upset and wouldn't support the 
government. I doubt very seriously if a battalion

18:56.870 --> 19:02.877
commander had to write home and say, hey, Your son 
has been killed. Whereas we had to write in each

19:07.273 --> 19:11.657
navigation, we even had to tell how it happened.

19:15.741 --> 19:19.404
But I'm getting off the beaten path. But firepower 
was very, very important.

19:30.153 --> 19:32.155
Were you optimistic about winning the war? When 
you first arrived in Vietnam, why or why not? Oh,

19:36.163 --> 19:36.584
yes.

19:39.488 --> 19:40.890
I was optimistic. We had vastly superior forces. 
And at that time, what we were doing is we were

19:45.015 --> 19:50.162
confronting the Viet Cong. We were, you know, this 
was before the North Vietnamese was involved in

19:50.182 --> 20:00.977
any significant extent.

20:01.278 --> 20:18.463
I guess a lot of it was ego, but we like to believe 
that the little Viet Cong peasant soldier was no

20:01.278 --> 20:18.463
match for us, no match for our equipment, no match 
for our firepower. They didn't have helicopters,

20:19.945 --> 20:22.408
for instance. We could get in helicopters and move 
about as we saw fit. If the Viet Cong wanted to move a

20:29.054 --> 20:32.257
force, they walked. They didn't have trucks for 
all practical purposes. And so yeah, I thought we

20:38.462 --> 20:44.308
could take care of it without any trouble. And 
secondly, I thought that what was taught in

20:44.648 --> 20:58.200
military doctrine at the time was the way to defeat 
a guerrilla army is to go into the area and to win the

20:59.328 --> 21:09.882
hearts and minds of the people in the area, and 
hence the guerrilla then had no base of support.

21:11.504 --> 21:19.815
And that was really our major effort when I got 
there, was to go in and win the hearts and minds of

21:11.504 --> 21:19.815
the people. And I thought we were doing a pretty 
good job of it, but apparently we were not, because

21:30.310 --> 21:48.410
The Vietcong continued to increase their forces 
and then of course the North Vietnamese moved in to

21:30.310 --> 21:48.410
take over and then it was a different ballgame 
altogether. What about when you left the war? Well

21:51.674 --> 21:59.322
I left from Quezon and

21:51.674 --> 21:59.322
my Initial judgment at that time was that they had 
lost quite a large force in that Tet Offensive. And

22:11.185 --> 22:13.688
they had lost a lot of people in the Tet Offensive. 
And I wondered if they had the will as a country, now

22:15.570 --> 22:29.207
I'm talking North Vietnam now, to continue to 
fight. I guess what I should have been concerned

22:30.335 --> 22:38.522
about was whether or not we had the will as a country 
to continue to fight. Because that was at the time

22:39.062 --> 22:52.293
when the anti-war forces back in the United States 
really started growing and started having an

22:39.062 --> 22:52.293
effect.

22:54.976 --> 23:00.240
But I thought that we could still win the war, well I 
still believe we could have won

23:03.308 --> 23:11.483
if as a nation we had a goal of winning rather than 
just a status quo. So I believe that there was an

23:13.125 --> 23:21.300
error as far as a national goal is concerned in the 
Vietnam War.

23:34.882 --> 23:38.385
The first time you were in Vietnam, you were only 
there for seven months. Yeah. Why was that? Well,

23:40.187 --> 23:51.539
on the way to Vietnam, I was, we stopped on Okinawa, 
and they changed my orders. A general that I had

23:52.419 --> 24:03.150
worked for back in Camp Lejeune saw my orders on the 
way through, and he had just moved there to form

24:04.902 --> 24:15.796
Fleet Marine Force Pacific forward staff and was 
told, you can take anybody you see coming through

24:04.902 --> 24:15.796
and form your staff. Well, he knew me. And he pulled 
me off. And all the begging and pleading and crying

24:20.422 --> 24:27.091
and so forth would not change his mind one iota. But 
he did promise me that after six months, he would

24:27.531 --> 24:32.918
send me on into Vietnam, which what he did and 
that's why it was for only seven months.

24:46.157 --> 24:46.257
Okay. Tell me your feelings about the anti-war 
movement.

24:51.566 --> 24:54.371
Well, I think they were wrong. You know, it's just 
that simple. I'm not against people protesting. I

25:01.721 --> 25:04.243
think that that's one of our basic rights. And if 
you did not have the right to disagree with your

25:05.125 --> 25:12.773
government, then you would not have a true 
democracy.

25:16.978 --> 25:27.110
I believe this all started, however, through a 
group of what were referred to then as hippies,

25:16.978 --> 25:27.110
which were really just anti-establishment. They 
were against everything. government was doing

25:28.720 --> 25:53.698
and it just happened that the government was 
involved in war and that just happened to be

25:28.720 --> 25:53.698
something that that they could could gather a lot 
of emotional support for i think most of the people

25:28.720 --> 25:53.698
involved in the the vietnamese war were doing so 
just because they they were against everything

25:55.400 --> 26:12.122
And I think there's a distinct difference between 
having an honest disagreement with what your

25:55.400 --> 26:12.122
government is doing and exercising

25:55.400 --> 26:12.122
a right which I support to the fullest to disagree, 
and then just being disagreeable. Now, it's hard

26:12.142 --> 26:24.698
to say the vast majority, but I will say this, that 
the vast majority of the leadership of the

26:12.142 --> 26:24.698
anti-war parties our anti-war group, in my 
judgment, were totally and completely worthless

26:25.184 --> 26:35.178
people.

26:39.304 --> 26:40.787
And I think it was wrong. And even though they had 
the right to do it, it did cost many lives. And it

26:48.598 --> 26:53.605
created an atmosphere in this country that the 
truth of the matter is we're just now working our

26:54.648 --> 27:05.624
way out of

26:54.648 --> 27:05.624
it. The Desert Storm Operation did a tremendous 
amount to reunite and refocus the unity of the

27:06.545 --> 27:19.203
country. But up until that point, They had been 
very successful in the anti-war environment that

27:24.382 --> 27:37.041
they had been able to create in this country. And 
how do I feel about it? I think it was absolutely

27:38.984 --> 27:42.028
terrible. I mean, you take a Jane Fonda, for 
instance, who went to North Vietnam, had pictures

27:42.048 --> 27:53.545
made of her on an anti-aircraft gun while US forces 
were flying combat missions over there and were

27:54.082 --> 28:10.862
being shot down by those very things. I can't 
forgive her for that.

28:15.147 --> 28:21.094
There is a perfectly acceptable dissent. She 
passed way beyond that. There are conscientious

28:25.570 --> 28:28.113
objectors. No problem with them. The vast 
majority of the people we're talking about though

28:31.796 --> 28:36.341
were not just conscientious objectors. They were 
just objectors.

28:41.246 --> 28:44.569
They objected to everything.

28:46.751 --> 28:48.953
When I left Vietnam, I went to Washington. And I got 
there after several of the big riots took place

28:56.013 --> 29:00.717
much of which were caused by the anti-war 
demonstrators. Part of it was civil rights, but

29:01.859 --> 29:06.363
the vast majority of this was not civil rights. The 
vast majority of it evolved around the anti-war

29:06.383 --> 29:12.689
demonstrators. ROTC armories, for instance, on 
college campuses weren't safe. People were

29:19.996 --> 29:22.518
breaking into those. They were stealing weapons. 
They were burning them. They were picketing

29:26.050 --> 29:38.722
around ROTCs,

29:26.050 --> 29:38.722
calling these young students killers, and so on 
and so forth. They were terribly objective

29:39.483 --> 29:44.988
people.

29:47.371 --> 29:55.939
And if I didn't feel so strongly about the basic 
rights and privileges

29:56.408 --> 29:58.230
what we have here in America. I would say, you know, 
let's exterminate these people. But they have the

30:03.477 --> 30:06.682
right to do it. And as objectionable as they are, in 
the final analysis, I truly believe that they were

30:08.544 --> 30:24.525
the very best advertisement for democracy there 
has ever been anywhere in the world because in

30:26.277 --> 30:55.896
russia and china and other places where this is 
they they could look and see and say how in the world

30:26.277 --> 30:55.896
can that nation allow people to do this see that's 
the true definition of freedom when you have the

30:26.277 --> 30:55.896
freedom to do that then you've got real freedom And 
like I say, had they been smart enough to know that

30:56.416 --> 31:10.991
they were democracy's best advertisement,

30:56.416 --> 31:10.991
they wouldn't have done it. They wouldn't have 
done it. And so I guess we have to give them a certain

31:16.076 --> 31:23.984
amount of credit for what we see throughout the 
world now. Russia, Russian communism. having

31:27.078 --> 31:28.582
gone down the tubes. All the other European 
communistic countries having gone down the

31:29.244 --> 31:34.477
tubes. The complete and total failure of 
communism throughout the world.
