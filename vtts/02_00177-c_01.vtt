00:03.777 --> 00:08.745
I want to do was run around out there on that field chasing some yell leader and going and throwing him in the fish.

00:08.825 --> 00:10.388
I want to cut out of there with that honey.

00:12.571 --> 00:16.898
Could a freshman avoid being part of the group to throw the yell leaders in?

00:16.958 --> 00:21.786
I suppose they could, but I never accomplished that task, you know.

00:22.828 --> 00:26.494
I mean, Haskell, it was all male, all military.

00:26.930 --> 00:31.442
There just weren't a lot of places and you're in uniform and your hair is cut.

00:31.462 --> 00:34.170
There's just not a lot of places to hide as a freshman.

00:34.611 --> 00:37.138
I mean, it was like being a prisoner.

00:38.121 --> 00:41.530
Where would you and your date on a Saturday night, where would you go?

00:42.269 --> 00:46.215
Well, the first place we'd head is out to Whiskey Bridge to get some refreshments.

00:47.136 --> 00:49.239
Did you have to prove your age there?

00:49.860 --> 00:50.741
No.

00:50.761 --> 00:52.524
They weren't real sticklers on that.

00:53.585 --> 01:02.218
And if it was, you'd just hang around the outside and an upperclassman would come through and, you know, you'd buy whatever you needed.

01:02.958 --> 01:06.663
You know, generally somebody had a party going at one of the motels.

01:06.723 --> 01:16.235
We'd go by there, dance a little bit, have a few drinks, and then we would head out and do what young people, you know, want to have some privacy.

01:17.356 --> 01:22.884
The, at Whiskey Bridge, were the prices about reasonable?

01:23.524 --> 01:27.970
Haskell, as far as I know, because I was not a, you know, uh,

01:28.743 --> 01:38.739
Whiskey was something that, you know, you were expected to have a pint bottle to pour in a Coke so that, you know, you were like everybody else having a drink.

01:38.759 --> 01:44.248
And I was not out there doing comparative shopping and had not bought enough to know one way or the other.

01:44.668 --> 01:47.473
I'm sure they gouged Aggies just like everybody else did.

01:48.114 --> 01:49.216
Now, what about Uncle Ed's?

01:49.276 --> 01:50.638
Did you all go to Uncle Ed's ever?

01:52.060 --> 01:56.387
You know, I went out there occasionally, but generally we, because we could walk,

01:56.772 --> 02:09.893
You could walk to the East Gate, and in fact our senior year, two of us, we had been over there so much, the guy that had it, they had thrown him out, and whoever owned the building, I can't remember the guy's name, knew we were in there.

02:09.913 --> 02:12.657
He said, boys, how would y'all like to own a beer joint?

02:13.498 --> 02:14.840
He said, own a beer joint?

02:14.861 --> 02:16.583
He said, well, actually you wouldn't own it.

02:17.064 --> 02:20.890
The licenses are all in my name and everything, but we'll work on halves.

02:21.241 --> 02:25.288
You know, you come in here and you operate this thing, and I'll split the profits with you.

02:25.929 --> 02:35.664
So my senior year, in addition to carrying 21 hours to correspondence, of course, I was a joint proprietor of a beer joint over there by the bus station.

02:35.725 --> 02:36.686
What was the name?

02:37.267 --> 02:43.637
You know, whatever was on the door when we got it, and it was somebody's name, and I can't even remember that.

02:44.459 --> 02:47.143
Don Lane, who's now dead, was the ringleader of that.

02:47.183 --> 02:48.345
That wasn't Spurkey's, was it?

02:48.781 --> 02:53.811
No, Sparky's has gone on to become a legend, but it's right in there where Sparky's is.

02:54.311 --> 02:58.459
You know, those, I mean, that was the, who was the developer there in Bryan?

02:58.499 --> 03:05.693
That was the first strip shopping center, I think, was over there at Eastgate, and it was in there near the bus station.

03:06.230 --> 03:10.458
All right, so you get your first semester grades, and they're not good.

03:10.498 --> 03:12.542
I'm on academic probation.

03:12.602 --> 03:15.186
I'm on disciplinary probation.

03:17.130 --> 03:21.418
I was already on disciplinary probation, and then I go on academic probation.

03:22.700 --> 03:29.773
And that's what General Rudder, he said, you know, Mr. Raines, he said, you didn't make it a semester that you have, he said, you've been on probation.

03:29.753 --> 03:39.395
Every semester, usually a freshman doesn't go on probation or a second semester, but you manage to get on your first semester, you're quite an unusual young man.

03:40.096 --> 03:43.003
Alright, at the end of your freshman year, what'd you do that summer?

03:43.684 --> 03:47.593
Went back and hung steel for Ellerbee.

03:48.164 --> 04:03.764
I had a good job and I made $2.75 an hour and overtime was double time and every Saturday my job was to go out and service all the caterpillars, change oil filters, pump them full of diesel, all that.

04:04.205 --> 04:07.309
He'd give me four hours for doing that, took me about an hour and a half to do it.

04:08.009 --> 04:13.176
And I was bringing home more in paychecks from my father.

04:13.561 --> 04:17.609
And did, in your family, was that all your money?

04:19.112 --> 04:20.775
No, you had, I mean, you know.

04:21.336 --> 04:22.258
Did you contribute something?

04:22.278 --> 04:24.342
There were all sorts of things that I owed.

04:25.504 --> 04:33.780
My dad sold my car after I got in trouble up there for about 10 cents on the dollar, which really made me angry.

04:33.760 --> 04:38.086
He went down to see his good friend who took it off his hands.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.910
In fact, he let me sell a car, you know.

04:41.751 --> 04:44.535
It was a hot machine.

04:45.736 --> 04:48.140
Reckon how much money you took with you as a sophomore?

04:49.201 --> 04:55.830
That summer that I earned, I was netting over $500 a month, which was big money.

04:55.930 --> 04:58.214
How much of that did you take to college to spend?

04:58.234 --> 05:00.857
Well, I didn't take, you know, I mean, I went back to college.

05:00.937 --> 05:01.438
I had to,

05:01.790 --> 05:09.665
You know, mother and dad would, I had a checking account up there, and they'd put in like $20 a month, you know, in the checking account.

05:11.428 --> 05:13.552
If I needed more, I had to call and justify it.

05:14.013 --> 05:19.183
All right, now that sophomore year, you're in ARROTC.

05:20.265 --> 05:21.267
Yep, and I'd qualified.

05:21.307 --> 05:23.832
I'd taken all the physicals and

05:24.875 --> 05:29.981
qualified for a Category 1 flight contract, which I was really excited about.

05:30.061 --> 05:33.665
And you're still aiming on law school as your career goal?

05:33.745 --> 05:40.772
Yeah, but I've been, my career counselor had told me, said, Raines, you can forget about law school.

05:40.792 --> 05:43.115
He said, people who go to law school have good grades.

05:43.756 --> 05:46.679
He said, you don't even have grades, much less good grades.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.482
Who did you turn to for counseling then?

05:49.563 --> 05:52.369
Well, by that time, you know, you're assigned to someone.

05:53.331 --> 05:55.315
You went into, like, the College of Business.

05:55.336 --> 05:58.061
You know, you declared a major up front.

05:58.402 --> 06:04.315
And so it was whoever, you know, talked to you over the College of Business.

06:04.548 --> 06:09.197
Make believe I had never seen academic registration at A&M.

06:09.217 --> 06:11.561
Describe registration.

06:12.423 --> 06:14.186
A Tasmanian cluster.

06:15.228 --> 06:20.358
It was, you know, just the most disorganized jumble in the world.

06:20.478 --> 06:22.742
It had been designed by somebody

06:22.722 --> 06:24.986
who had a lot of military experience.

06:26.489 --> 06:36.968
I mean, it just, if there was a way to get a lot of people standing in a lot of lines to get to some place, and it was a catch-22, oh, well, you've stood in this line, well, listen,

06:37.319 --> 06:43.129
You can't get in this line until you go through the line so-and-so over there and get your ticket punch.

06:43.149 --> 06:45.332
So then you had to go stand in that line to get there.

06:45.693 --> 06:46.835
Now you've got your ticket punch.

06:46.875 --> 06:47.937
You get back in this thing.

06:47.997 --> 06:48.898
I want to take this course.

06:48.979 --> 06:49.580
I'm sorry.

06:49.940 --> 06:51.122
This section is full.

06:51.683 --> 06:58.394
You might try standing in that line over there, which is such a fine, and you redo your schedule about 15 times.

06:58.935 --> 07:01.740
I mean, it's just the worst thing in the world.

07:02.851 --> 07:05.336
And there wasn't any shortcut, was there?

07:05.356 --> 07:06.117
Wasn't any escape?

07:06.297 --> 07:08.201
If there was, I never found it.

07:09.463 --> 07:13.771
And how did you and your buddies find out about the easy courses and the hard courses?

07:13.791 --> 07:18.700
Well, those were the things that you were preregistered for by,

07:18.680 --> 07:21.402
Denton and Kutesh and all that.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.804
For instance, you know, I told you about rocks for jocks.

07:24.205 --> 07:27.668
There was Dr. Dan, the grade point man in sociology.

07:28.128 --> 07:29.449
Did you ever take a course from him?

07:29.469 --> 07:30.210
Of course.

07:30.410 --> 07:31.291
Describe that.

07:31.311 --> 07:34.053
Oh, well, in criminology, Kutesh taught that.

07:34.213 --> 07:40.679
In fact, he wound up over at the prison system, I think, as a part of the keepers, not as an inmate.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.442
But it was a wonderful course.

07:44.502 --> 07:45.243
Fascinating.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.505
And you made an A.

07:48.262 --> 07:50.768
I mean, it was just, it was a given.

07:51.790 --> 07:53.093
And I didn't cut that class.

07:53.133 --> 07:54.196
I really enjoyed it.

07:54.216 --> 08:02.455
The classes I cut, Haskell, if I'd ever had a prof like you, you know, when you were teaching up there, I sat in on your classes.

08:02.655 --> 08:07.266
And my kids, you know, I pulled strings to get them into your classes.

08:07.887 --> 08:17.902
At that time, your freshman year, you just had all these in these huge amphitheaters at one o'clock after everyone had a lot of starches.

08:17.922 --> 08:20.886
And, you know, you couldn't hear because there's many people snoring.

08:20.926 --> 08:25.172
You know, it's just I can't think of a worse academic setting.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.858
So what I do is I wouldn't even buy the books.

08:28.878 --> 08:30.160
You know, we got money for books.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.783
I put that, you know, that was my walking around money.

08:33.164 --> 08:37.270
I'd borrow one of my buddy's books and I'd take it and I'd read the book.

08:37.925 --> 08:42.032
And I've always had the ability, you know, because mother started me reading when I was very young.

08:42.893 --> 08:46.539
And I have the ability to read and absorb things and remember things.

08:47.541 --> 08:49.945
So I'd read the book and the quiz would come up.

08:49.965 --> 08:51.708
They'd say, we've covered these chapters.

08:51.788 --> 08:55.194
And I'd borrow somebody's notes and I'd show up for the quiz.

08:55.254 --> 08:58.279
And hell, I could make a C standing on my head and made a B a lot of the times.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.323
And so I just didn't go to class.

09:01.343 --> 09:03.306
I viewed it as a waste of my time.

09:04.247 --> 09:07.011
You said money for books.

09:07.031 --> 09:12.439
In fact, I showed up for a final one time, and the guy would, he thought I was taking the final for somebody else.

09:12.479 --> 09:15.123
He said, you're not Jack Raines.

09:15.143 --> 09:16.585
I said, yes, sir, I'm Jack Raines.

09:17.246 --> 09:18.828
I said, here's my driver's license.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.833
He said, I've taught this class, and you've never been in this class.

09:21.933 --> 09:23.815
I said, yes, sir, I was here for three finals.

09:24.036 --> 09:25.838
I mean, for three major quizzes.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.000
Here for the final.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.915
He said, I know who's my class.

09:29.015 --> 09:30.216
I teach his class every day.

09:30.276 --> 09:31.437
You're not my class.

09:31.457 --> 09:32.959
We went around and around.

09:36.462 --> 09:38.324
You mentioned having money for books.

09:38.564 --> 09:41.127
Now, did you get any athletic funding?

09:41.167 --> 09:43.509
Oh, I had a piece of a thing, and that was back.

09:43.529 --> 09:47.914
See, they weren't so stuffy about alumni help.

09:48.274 --> 09:50.116
You know, Charlie Myers mailed us a check.

09:51.277 --> 09:55.842
You know, I'd get a deferred compensation out of Ellerbee Brothers.

09:55.882 --> 09:56.903
You know, that, I mean,

09:57.203 --> 10:03.653
Without that, I guess my family would have let me have more money than I had.

10:03.693 --> 10:11.125
But, you know, at that time, I think you paid $125 a semester for room board tuition and you got your books.

10:11.246 --> 10:12.588
It was a poor boy's school.

10:12.688 --> 10:20.781
As far as you and your buddies were aware, were any of the athletes in the Bear Bryant days getting big money under the table?

10:21.672 --> 10:23.114
Well, sure you knew that.

10:23.134 --> 10:31.403
I mean, you knew, you know, John David Crowe had the definitive statement when they asked him his first year in the NFL, said, what's the difference between his college and pro ball?

10:31.423 --> 10:33.245
He said, what do you get paid in the lighted room here?

10:34.326 --> 10:43.917
And my other favorite John David story, and he and Carol, you know, I got to know them, and Carol was just a saint, and everybody loved her, and

10:44.217 --> 10:50.476
Harrison, who was freshman quarterback, that Milstead started behind, I mean, was behind Harrison.

10:50.857 --> 10:52.422
He and Joni were married.

10:52.942 --> 10:55.907
We used to go over where all the married students were in Jackson.

10:56.288 --> 10:58.451
You know, she'd cook chicken, fried steak for us.

10:58.491 --> 11:06.805
We'd all chip in to buy groceries and that sort of thing and get a decent meal because you'd get so tired of eating out of those mess halls.

11:07.105 --> 11:15.439
But you knew who had a better standard of living than others and it had a lot to do with who was starting and they just got more help.

11:16.027 --> 11:18.170
HENDERSON HALL IS BUILT WHILE YOU'RE THERE?

11:18.611 --> 11:18.891
YEAH.

11:19.171 --> 11:24.339
WELL, I WAS NO LONGER EVEN A MARGINAL ATHLETE, BUT I WENT OVER THERE.

11:24.359 --> 11:26.141
I HAD BUDDIES, YOU KNOW, LIVING OVER THERE.

11:26.301 --> 11:27.804
AND THAT WAS JUST FOOTBALL?

11:27.824 --> 11:29.386
THAT WAS STRICTLY FOOTBALL.

11:29.466 --> 11:39.900
AND THEY MAY HAVE HAD, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE BASKETBALL COACH WAS LEFLER, AND HE RECREATED SOME HOT SHOT, AND BRIAN LET HIM PUT THE HOT SHOT IN.

11:40.001 --> 11:42.624
YOU KNOW, I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HAD ONE ROOM FOR TWO GUYS.

11:42.724 --> 11:45.308
WHERE DID THEY EAT?

11:45.524 --> 11:50.608
They had, in Sabisa, you had training tables over there.

11:50.628 --> 11:52.410
In Duncan, you had training tables.

11:53.191 --> 11:54.892
And training tables in two places.

11:55.032 --> 12:01.898
And food was basically the same, you know, unless you had some guy on a special diet or something like that.

12:02.239 --> 12:03.159
Coach would eat over there.

12:03.199 --> 12:11.227
Some guy that was trying to get him to lose weight, he'd take the fat boys and they'd sit out here and they'd bring them a lot of vegetables and no gravy.

12:11.247 --> 12:15.210
Did anybody ever try to play any jokes on Coach Bryant?

12:15.342 --> 12:18.186
Not that I'm aware of.

12:18.226 --> 12:18.566
You know.

12:19.948 --> 12:24.034
I mean, Coach Bryant was not a man you trifled with.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.999
And yet, I was the world's most marginal kid.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.302
And I'll show you something upstairs.

12:30.543 --> 12:33.387
I have two letters on the wall up there.

12:33.407 --> 12:36.651
One's from Ronald Reagan on his last day in office.

12:36.671 --> 12:38.774
And the other's from Coach Bryant right before he died.

12:39.815 --> 12:41.097
And...

12:41.363 --> 12:50.855
Who were the other, who were, other than John David and Charlie Milstead and people like that, who were the other celebrity students while you were at A&M?

12:50.875 --> 12:51.495
Were there any?

12:52.456 --> 13:06.273
Well, Kruger, of course, you know, and Charlie Kruger, and I know, you know, Rolf and all that bunch, and... Were there any important millionaire sons, politician sons?

13:06.293 --> 13:10.999
Well, my freshman roommate when I was in the Corps was a guy named Yost.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.384
And he was in all kinds of trouble.

13:13.444 --> 13:20.160
And one night, boy, I heard everybody hitting the wall and all this stuff going on with us there in CQ, call the quarters we're studying.

13:20.722 --> 13:27.999
And the door opens and filling up this doorways, a three-star general with fruit salad all over him.

13:28.019 --> 13:29.342
And, you know, we're like that.

13:29.778 --> 13:32.722
And Yost says, Dad, what are you doing here?

13:33.123 --> 13:34.685
You know, I'm standing in a brace.

13:34.705 --> 13:35.767
And he says, at ease, son.

13:36.327 --> 13:37.028
He sits down.

13:37.068 --> 13:39.212
He had flown into Bryan Air Force Base.

13:39.292 --> 13:41.475
He was in charge of the Air Defense Command.

13:42.436 --> 13:44.860
And we didn't know who in hell his son was.

13:45.921 --> 13:48.425
But he had gotten pretty bad grades.

13:48.605 --> 13:52.771
And so the old man flew down to see him.

13:53.131 --> 13:54.493
He was like a celebrity.

13:54.694 --> 13:57.017
I mean, in our world, he was a big celebrity.

13:56.997 --> 14:10.990
And then there was one of the boys that was a Cleburne was there and nobody knew who the hell he was until one of the guys said he asked

14:11.155 --> 14:36.133
one of the guys if he could uh use his car his parents were coming in he had to pick them up out the airport and you know we didn't have commercial service incident well how that happened the airport you know they had a plane and this is the king ranch family yeah and which i later found out but i didn't know who kleeberg was from adam's all thoughts were there any famous people that came to visit

14:36.637 --> 14:39.282
Uh, performers, politicians.

14:39.302 --> 14:51.928
Well, my senior year, uh, well, my freshman year, there was a guy from, uh, Port Arthur named Bubba Hurd, who was a Three Diamond man, and he was head of, uh, the Town Hall series.

14:52.938 --> 15:12.702
And when we had run into, and before I went to A&M, we'd got out to California to work, and we went to a place called The Hungry Eye in San Francisco, and there was a group that performed out there.

15:13.063 --> 15:20.432
There was a local California group that we really thought was good, and I gave their name and their agent who I met to Bubba Hurd.

15:20.472 --> 15:21.493
So Bubba Hurd,

15:22.942 --> 15:26.729
The next year, I'm coming up, I'm gonna be a freshman.

15:27.130 --> 15:39.533
He had contacted this group and sent them $500 as an advance on a $1,000 contract for them to book and play on A&M campus.

15:39.513 --> 15:54.754
Well that year they released their first album and I mean they had like two hits in the top ten off that album and

15:55.409 --> 16:03.024
They came, and they honored their date, and they came in the Kingston Trio with the hottest thing going in this cow college.

16:03.044 --> 16:04.287
You had them booked.

16:04.407 --> 16:05.289
Where did they perform?

16:05.550 --> 16:05.990
G. Raleigh?

16:06.011 --> 16:06.632
G. Raleigh White.

16:06.652 --> 16:07.754
That's where everybody did.

16:08.536 --> 16:13.165
Edie Gourmet came down to perform, and...

16:13.432 --> 16:16.857
She was so smitten with Bubba, Bubba later that night.

16:17.458 --> 16:20.642
And he left with her, and they went to Dallas.

16:20.722 --> 16:21.924
She had another date up there.

16:22.485 --> 16:27.732
I thought he was going to run away from home with her.

16:27.752 --> 16:33.781
And did, you know, you guys did some mischief sometimes at Guy and Hull.

16:34.162 --> 16:37.827
Was there any mischief during a concert at G. Raleigh?

16:37.987 --> 16:40.651
Well, they'd beat them to death, you know what I mean?

16:40.671 --> 16:41.873
Listen, we're in here.

16:41.893 --> 16:42.814
You're not going to...

16:42.794 --> 16:52.204
You know, if you have the Kingston Trio up there, you know, if it had been a senior starting to do something, they'd have mobbed him.

16:52.364 --> 16:56.047
Describe the Quack Shack in those days and campus health services.

16:56.067 --> 17:00.132
Well, you know, we used to live, you know, no matter if you went over there, they gave you an SMU pill.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.613
It was one of those red and blue pills.

17:02.754 --> 17:05.297
You know, he said, listen, my arm's broken in three places.

17:05.317 --> 17:08.380
Well, take this SMU pill and I'm going to see me in the morning, you know.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.142
We never figured out.

17:10.182 --> 17:11.824
I think it was probably a placebo.

17:12.645 --> 17:13.726
Who was the doc then?

17:13.746 --> 17:14.307
I don't know.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.248
I never, you know.

17:16.009 --> 17:18.892
If we were hurt, you know, Smokey had us under his.

17:19.933 --> 17:22.977
You didn't want to be hurt because Smokey would hurt you worse.

17:22.997 --> 17:24.739
He'd convince you you weren't really hurt.

17:25.620 --> 17:36.713
And fortunately, I never had a, you know, most of mine were muscle tears and strained ligaments and that kind of stuff.

17:37.030 --> 17:40.408
all the surgery I had later that I probably should have had then.

17:40.895 --> 17:43.117
Monk Meeks, did you know him?

17:43.858 --> 17:44.979
He was the equipment manager.

17:44.999 --> 17:45.240
Right.

17:45.620 --> 17:48.083
I know who he is, but didn't know him.

17:49.905 --> 17:51.747
Mamaliga was the strength coach.

17:51.827 --> 17:56.352
I see his son stay in touch with Mammy's boy.

17:58.434 --> 18:01.077
Trying to think who else was around down there that still has.

18:01.437 --> 18:10.227
Of course, Billy Pickard is, you know, his trainer down there and still a dear friend today, and we helped his son get on with the CIA, and he's...

18:10.207 --> 18:13.955
He didn't want to be with the NFL team or the CIA.

18:14.155 --> 18:16.279
I said, well, that's a match.

18:18.885 --> 18:23.093
Describe, during your years at A&M, describe the student body in general.

18:23.554 --> 18:24.216
Who were they?

18:24.256 --> 18:25.458
What were their attitudes?

18:25.478 --> 18:26.620
Where did they come from?

18:27.081 --> 18:29.346
Well, they really fell into two classes.

18:29.950 --> 18:34.917
There were the guys that were there because their daddies had been there, and generally they hated the place.

18:34.937 --> 18:39.044
I mean, you know, they had just been raised on a steady diet A&M.

18:39.184 --> 18:39.945
Some of them loved it.

18:40.025 --> 18:47.436
I mean, you know, but there were a lot of those kids that were there because they had to be there, and they started off with a red-ass attitude to begin with.

18:48.074 --> 19:00.017
Then there were people like me that got there for some of the strangest reasons, you know, that were the kind that you could drop us in a room full of shit and we'd be digging, looking for the Shetland pony and having a big time, you know, no matter what.

19:00.698 --> 19:09.795
And then there were just a lot of people from small towns, country places, you know, that...

19:09.775 --> 19:21.945
wanted to major in animal husbandry or had been in the future farmers or, you know, the real rural kids.

19:22.381 --> 19:24.824
You know, they thought College Station was pretty nifty.

19:25.746 --> 19:30.653
And, you know, there were some of us that were pretty hip or thought we were.

19:31.093 --> 19:36.260
You know, and we were going down to Austin all the time, and we knew what it was like.

19:36.601 --> 19:38.944
We had seen the other side of the khaki curtain.

19:39.084 --> 19:41.828
We had escaped the outside and come back.

19:41.848 --> 19:47.036
We used to listen to Radio Free Austin at night, you know, broadcasted music behind the khaki curtain.

19:47.857 --> 19:52.303
In the spring, you knew the spring was coming because guys had opened the windows and stuff.

19:52.688 --> 19:56.633
I ate this fucking place.

19:56.653 --> 19:59.016
And you'd hear guys screwed up.

19:59.056 --> 20:00.858
It was like an edible roar.

20:00.958 --> 20:05.924
You knew that it was getting time for the water pipes.

20:06.244 --> 20:09.568
And in terms of their background, was there much diversity?

20:11.531 --> 20:13.893
Well, not really.

20:14.074 --> 20:18.699
I mean, most of the kids that were there, there wasn't a lot of diversity in Texas.

20:18.719 --> 20:21.042
You got to remember, it was totally segregated then.

20:21.224 --> 20:29.020
In Port Arthur, I had friends who were Mexican-Americans, and one of my best friends at A&M was Champ Fraga.

20:29.501 --> 20:31.044
He was a baseball player.

20:31.645 --> 20:32.487
FRAGA.

20:32.867 --> 20:33.609
FRAGA.

20:33.769 --> 20:39.400
He is here in town now, and his son, you know, godfathered his son.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.262
We're very close.

20:40.664 --> 20:45.209
He was honored, the Fraga family was honored by the Mexican American Bar Association.

20:45.249 --> 20:49.033
He asked me to be the speaker for the family because I know all of them.

20:49.053 --> 20:56.241
And Lupe and I, he would invite me to go home with him on the weekends and I took him and he told his story.

20:56.261 --> 20:59.564
He said, the first time Jack came home with me, we went to a dance.

20:59.584 --> 21:02.688
And Jack came over and said, hey champ, am I dressed funny or something?

21:02.768 --> 21:04.029
And he said, no, why?

21:04.109 --> 21:07.853
Because I said, well, you know, people keep staring at me and I mean, you know,

21:08.288 --> 21:15.502
I've checked, my fly's done, and he said, I laughed and told him, we don't get a lot of Anglos in the bar on Saturday night.

21:16.504 --> 21:18.187
But I hadn't really thought about it.

21:18.207 --> 21:19.529
I was the only guy down there.

21:20.411 --> 21:25.140
And that was, he said, you know, everybody asks me, you know, who's your white friend?

21:26.783 --> 21:27.945
But we didn't think anything about it.

21:27.965 --> 21:31.512
We started traveling to all the baseball games because he was the first

21:32.082 --> 21:35.293
Mexican to play in the Southwest Conference.

21:35.915 --> 21:38.223
And Baylor, I mean, we had a war at Baylor.

21:38.243 --> 21:39.848
They were just vicious over there.

21:40.722 --> 21:45.328
But at A&M, did it matter among you and your buddies?

21:45.348 --> 21:48.552
No, everyone was treated the same way, shitty, you know.

21:49.593 --> 21:50.955
They did not discriminate.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.137
Treated everyone like crap.

21:53.298 --> 21:54.579
Jewish boys, were there some?

21:54.599 --> 21:56.161
Yeah, we had Jewish kids.

21:56.221 --> 21:58.484
And again, you know, in Port Arthur we had Jewish kids.

21:58.624 --> 22:01.448
I can't ever remember anyone making any distinction there.

22:01.468 --> 22:02.749
Or between Mexican kids.

22:03.070 --> 22:04.892
And we scrimmaged black high school.

22:05.252 --> 22:09.818
So it was, while the society was...

22:10.507 --> 22:38.607
segregated we did not grow up thinking about differences in people at least in port arthur now maybe they did in other parts of the state and you know you'd hear the that's when amos and andy was on the radio and i mean it was just a different time but i had black friends even then that i'd worked with in the merchant marine or i worked with out at those refineries or uh you know on a work crew it was who could get the job done why did it why

22:38.941 --> 22:43.449
Why did Aggies accept people so well?

22:44.170 --> 22:55.209
Well, I think it's because a lot of people look down on Aggies, and we were a tribe unto ourselves, and still are.

22:55.670 --> 22:57.393
I mean, that's what makes us unique.

22:57.453 --> 22:58.936
And almost everybody had a nickname.

22:59.878 --> 23:00.659
Oh, that was good.

23:01.240 --> 23:04.105
My mother, my mother,

23:05.148 --> 23:07.351
My nickname at A&M was Snake.

23:10.536 --> 23:12.479
You'd have to ask some of those guys.

23:12.560 --> 23:23.697
I was kind of a cool dude that tried to slip through the crack.

23:24.132 --> 23:28.745
You know, the snake can get in there, or the snake can get this done, or something.

23:29.046 --> 23:30.811
What are some of the other nicknames you remember?

23:32.496 --> 23:34.281
Well, snake was the one that I got.

23:34.322 --> 23:35.385
No, no, no, for other people.

23:35.425 --> 23:36.307
Oh, for other people.

23:36.327 --> 23:38.614
But I was going to tell you this story.

23:39.742 --> 23:43.026
I'm there and the phone rings at home.

23:44.067 --> 23:45.629
And mother answered the phone and said, yes.

23:46.971 --> 23:47.912
Said, yes, it is.

23:49.093 --> 23:52.778
She said, no, I only have one son and his name is Jack.

23:53.178 --> 23:54.900
There is no snake living here.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.503
And she hung up and I said, hey, mom, that was for me.

23:57.523 --> 23:58.805
She said, no, it's not.

23:58.865 --> 24:01.508
And the phone rang and I ran and got the phone.

24:01.528 --> 24:03.991
She did not like my nickname.

24:04.231 --> 24:07.335
I will not have a snake as a son.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.657
Why do they call you that?

24:08.737 --> 24:10.039
Oh, mom, it's just a nickname.

24:11.161 --> 24:15.147
Oh, they had, you know, we could sit here and talk about nicknames.

24:15.808 --> 24:17.431
John Hall wrote a book about that.

24:17.471 --> 24:18.613
He brought a recorder down.

24:18.773 --> 24:21.437
I did an information dump with him.

24:21.517 --> 24:23.039
Go pull one of his damn books.

24:23.119 --> 24:24.902
It's got every nickname in the world.

24:25.283 --> 24:27.366
And we got to laugh, and I'd forgotten some of those.

24:27.386 --> 24:29.049
I'd get with those guys, and you'd start.

24:30.231 --> 24:35.078
Were those nicknames, in fact, acceptance labels?

24:35.362 --> 24:43.169
Well, if some guy you didn't want to mess with and his name was Herschel, you made it a point of calling him Herschel.

24:44.791 --> 24:52.238
Not to have a nickname meant that you were devoid of personality or distinguishing characteristics.

24:52.898 --> 24:55.401
And what was the key to being accepted at A&M?

24:57.923 --> 25:03.208
I think willing to do your part, being one of the guys.

25:05.618 --> 25:14.478
Not pulling your, you know, if you pulled your weight and, you know, if all the freshmen got in trouble and you didn't whine and bitch about it, you were in good shape.

25:17.925 --> 25:24.640
But if, you know, the only people that ever had any trouble at A&M were the ones that were the crybaby's mama's boy.

25:25.750 --> 25:28.655
And they really then begin to catch more hell than anyone else.

25:28.675 --> 25:30.958
Once someone got like that, it could get pretty vicious.

25:30.978 --> 25:32.761
They'd decide, you know, that guy needs to go.

25:32.781 --> 25:33.582
They'd run him off.

25:34.604 --> 25:41.335
And I saw, you know, a couple of freshmen just, it was like the weakest chick, and they all were going to peck on it and kill it.

25:42.116 --> 25:43.718
And that was bad.

25:44.139 --> 25:45.621
We had a fish black.

25:46.202 --> 25:47.064
You talk about colorful.

25:47.204 --> 25:47.845
What did he say?

25:49.327 --> 25:51.030
Until she gets them all taken.

25:51.090 --> 25:53.614
Honey, we're going to take a lunch break whenever you're ready.

25:59.939 --> 26:01.582
Oh, Fish Black.

26:01.982 --> 26:03.505
I've got to tell you about Fish Black.

26:04.766 --> 26:06.509
You know, Hart Hall had those ramps.

26:08.452 --> 26:23.856
Well, we had been, it was in the fall semester, and everybody was coming back from Chow, and there was this big, just a huge explosion, and it came from the direction of our dorm, and everyone went running.

26:23.876 --> 26:25.178
We thought the damn thing had blown up.

26:25.699 --> 26:27.702
We got over there, and windows were blown out.

26:28.610 --> 26:31.337
And everybody said, what was it?

26:32.740 --> 26:38.595
Didn't break our windows, but several windows were the concussion blown windows out.

26:38.615 --> 26:42.585
So ours was open as always.

26:43.831 --> 26:48.422
So they said, you know, somebody had set off an explosive device out in the quadrangle.

26:48.442 --> 26:52.551
You know, one side was open and three were closed.

26:52.571 --> 26:56.581
And they said, you know, it's good if it had been such and such an arm had a closed quadrangle.

26:56.661 --> 26:59.207
It would have, you know, they came over.

26:59.693 --> 27:08.691
And the FBI, they called the FBI, and they investigated because it was one of the professors says, you know, this is gunpowder residue.

27:08.711 --> 27:11.136
Said somebody, you know, set off a bomb.

27:11.256 --> 27:13.060
You know, this was not a firecracker.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.322
This was a bomb.

27:15.284 --> 27:18.991
And there were pieces of shrapnel embedded.

27:19.031 --> 27:20.915
You know, I mean, it's just lucky no one was killed.

27:20.935 --> 27:21.837
Everybody's gone, yeah.

27:22.795 --> 27:24.639
So they came over and they did this.

27:24.699 --> 27:27.606
They investigated one day.

27:27.626 --> 27:30.652
I mean, these guys came and they went up in fish black.

27:30.672 --> 27:31.434
They arrested him.

27:32.256 --> 27:35.944
And he had in his room four cans of

27:36.633 --> 27:43.161
black blasting powder, you know, the kind that they used to put, you know, blow stumps up with and all this stuff.

27:43.501 --> 27:48.907
And he had weapons and he had all this shit up there in the room directly above us.

27:49.348 --> 27:51.730
Fish Black had some little strange problems.

27:52.091 --> 27:55.815
And that was one of the colorful characters.

27:55.835 --> 27:57.497
And what happened to him after that?

27:57.517 --> 27:59.359
We never saw Fish Black again.

27:59.439 --> 28:03.484
I think they took him away and got him some help.

28:03.886 --> 28:19.228
Then we had a sophomore named Andy Ersman, and Ersman was a swimmer, and he thought that he was really serious about this military stuff, and here he was gonna haze all these, all the freshmen in the athletic dorm.

28:19.208 --> 28:21.611
And Ersman was always running around.

28:21.631 --> 28:27.218
He said, I'm going to, you know, write you rams, and you've got to march in a bullring, and we'd tear it up.

28:27.318 --> 28:31.583
And, you know, Colonel Melcher would talk to us and talk to Ersman.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.425
And he always had his brass.

28:33.605 --> 28:37.870
He ironed his shirts every night, always in uniform, had his brass.

28:38.231 --> 28:42.015
And his shoes were just absolutely, they looked like patent leather.

28:42.035 --> 28:43.117
He'd shine them all the time.

28:44.458 --> 28:47.562
And so one weekend, he went home to Dallas.

28:48.301 --> 28:56.117
And we went in there to his room and we put a half pound of shrimp, took his bed apart and put it in the bed.

28:56.157 --> 29:06.799
Another guy took his pillow, took the stitching out half of the feathers and defecated in there and refilled it and stitched it and put that back.

29:06.779 --> 29:22.298
And then we took his shoes and spent the weekend sandpapering them so that they looked like suede when he came back, which was really kind of a cruel thing to do in retrospect, but it seemed like a nice thing to do at the time.

29:22.318 --> 29:23.421
Did he retaliate?

29:24.278 --> 29:27.221
Well, you know, who did this?

29:27.241 --> 29:29.524
You know, of course, everyone had an ironclad alibi.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.206
I mean, none of us were there.

29:31.326 --> 29:39.596
Everybody was, you know, there were 10 of us that were drinking at, you know, Uncle Ed's, and there were five gone.

29:40.136 --> 29:42.079
You know, I mean, there was no one there.

29:42.099 --> 29:43.781
That dorm was deserted that day.

29:43.801 --> 29:47.926
It must have been someone, because he was notorious for Hayes and core guys.

29:48.346 --> 29:53.492
And, you know, they'd say, who the hell is this athlete coming over here to the quadrangle to haze our freshman?

29:53.472 --> 29:56.797
And they said, you know, it must have been the upperclassmen knew, of course.

29:56.817 --> 29:59.380
And they said, you know, Ersman, we've told you to quit going over there.

29:59.400 --> 30:04.768
I said, there's probably some sophomores over there that did this to you that just don't like you hazing their freshmen.

30:06.090 --> 30:11.397
So then Ersman, about a day or two later, you know, he's complaining about the smell in his room.

30:11.849 --> 30:16.555
And so he gets, and people would come in his room and say, Erseman, I don't smell anything.

30:16.615 --> 30:17.556
You can't smell that.

30:18.598 --> 30:19.659
Smell what, Ant?

30:19.759 --> 30:25.146
You need to go over to the quack shack and get your, you know, your sniffer checked out.

30:25.567 --> 30:27.189
God damn it, you can't smell that.

30:27.590 --> 30:31.815
So he'd play in there at night and put his head in his pillow.

30:32.167 --> 30:35.370
I mean, it would gag a maggot walking by that room.

30:35.871 --> 30:37.473
I know you guys can smell it.

30:37.973 --> 30:41.717
Ersman, you know, and he didn't have a roommate.

30:42.298 --> 30:45.721
And so we'd make him in those guys.

30:45.901 --> 30:48.925
They said, you know, we've got to do something.

30:48.985 --> 30:49.946
We can't stand it.

30:50.046 --> 30:53.249
And so you'd close both crapper doors, and they'd put towels under it.

30:53.610 --> 30:54.531
They'd have their windows up.

30:54.551 --> 30:55.992
We'd give them cross ventilation.

30:56.012 --> 30:59.676
And Ersman is in there, and it just got worse and worse and worse.

30:59.656 --> 31:02.304
And Andy went home one weekend and didn't come back.

31:03.448 --> 31:07.300
And later on, we found out he had had a nervous breakdown, and I felt bad about him.

31:07.722 --> 31:11.995
But, uh... And he spelled his name with an E, E-R-S-H?
