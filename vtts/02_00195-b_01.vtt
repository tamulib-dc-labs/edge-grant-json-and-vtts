00:02.933 --> 00:14.944
The fall of 1944,

00:02.933 --> 00:14.944
when you and many of your classmates knew you were 
going on active duty, did you all still take your

00:02.933 --> 00:14.944
academics seriously? Not as seriously as we 
probably should. Some did. Some of the young ones

00:18.167 --> 00:21.691
particularly, you know, I don't know. But

00:21.851 --> 00:26.175
you did go to class every day? We did go to class. I 
always went to class. It was the easiest way to get

00:28.897 --> 00:30.419
by. I mean, I have a good memory. I retained what 
people say, take a couple of notes, and I could come

00:32.212 --> 00:37.579
back and do it. It was just so much easier than 
trying to dig it up on your own and have the

00:37.599 --> 00:43.407
professor tell you, and learn from the professor. 
Now, had you already officially joined the Marine

00:43.787 --> 00:48.954
Corps? Second semester, yes. Second semester. 
Second semester. August, just when the first

00:52.899 --> 01:00.109
semester was over in August, I joined the Corps. 
All right, and you volunteered for the Marine

01:00.157 --> 01:04.743
Corps because of your brother. Because of my 
brother. He's a historian, and you're a

01:07.207 --> 01:08.849
historian. I'm a multiple selection guy. A, my 
brother. B, I don't like cold weather, and I knew

01:14.697 --> 01:20.244
that the Europe was cold. C, I didn't want to wear 
wool next to my skin, and I knew the Army would make

01:21.526 --> 01:27.274
you wear wool shirts next to your skin. D, I'd 
rather kill a Jap than kill a blond-headed,

01:30.093 --> 01:37.921
blue-eyed German who might be my cousin.

01:42.805 --> 01:57.940
My father knew people at the replacement, or the 
drives where you first went in down in San Antonio,

01:42.805 --> 01:57.940
and I had a cousin that went through there and went 
into OCS, and everybody said my father did it for

01:42.805 --> 01:57.940
him. And if I did anything, I wanted to do it in my own 
name and not have my father get credit for it as then

01:58.426 --> 02:05.733
a lieutenant colonel in the Army.

02:08.556 --> 02:10.117
So I'm of multiple causes. Why did I do it? I wanted 
to replace my brother. I wanted to kill jobs. I

02:15.843 --> 02:25.472
wanted to, if I had to kill anybody, I didn't want to 
go into, I didn't want to get my feet cold and get

02:15.843 --> 02:25.472
frostbite and stuff like that. So all those 
reasons are there. I'm from Orange County. And the

02:29.407 --> 02:40.662
Kishi family, which produced a number of Aggies, 
some of whom were real World War II heroes, were

02:29.407 --> 02:40.662
there any Japanese-American students at A&M? I 
don't remember seeing them. I've never heard of

02:42.864 --> 02:44.326
any during the war. I've never heard of them. 
Right. That fall, you're still treated as fish,

02:52.477 --> 02:56.743
and so you still have to clean things up. Yeah. and 
there were

02:57.404 --> 03:10.344
run details, and there were yell practices, but 
you all did not march into the game. After the game,

03:10.864 --> 03:15.191
when the Aggies won, did you still throw the yell 
leaders into the pond? I don't remember doing

03:15.551 --> 03:17.735
that. I don't remember doing that. I don't 
remember the pond, as a matter of fact. Did many

03:22.936 --> 03:24.838
people come to the games? No. Because gas was 
tough. Gas was tough. If they ever got 38,000

03:29.664 --> 03:33.268
there, it was a huge, big crowd. And sometimes they 
came on the train? Oh, yeah. And the big thing

03:38.274 --> 03:47.104
that's changed for that whole era is going to the 
game was a social event. Men wore jackets and ties,

03:47.185 --> 03:55.137
and women wore dresses and corsages and silk 
stockings and silk hose. And all the games were day

03:55.157 --> 03:56.619
games. And all the games were day games. And it was a 
time to get together in the YMCA. You couldn't get

04:05.411 --> 04:07.494
through the YMCA hardly at all. It was crowded. 
Crowded. And so it was a good experience. Did

04:12.802 --> 04:15.045
anybody take any strong drinks to games? Oh, yes. 
Much more. drunkenness in those days than there is

04:17.290 --> 04:20.053
today. Where did Aggies buy their drinks?

04:24.878 --> 04:27.161
Neither my father, mother, nor I drank. So I don't 
know. They just had them. There were a lot of

04:31.345 --> 04:35.911
advertising lights stopped outside of Waco to get 
beer and so forth. I know that Austin was the

04:38.253 --> 04:47.263
smallest town where you could buy, where they had a 
university where you could buy beer. And all the

04:47.530 --> 04:49.532
games were day games. All the games were day games, 
and the band was there. Did you go on court trips

04:54.238 --> 04:56.200
during the war? Yeah, hitchhiking. One of them, a 
friend of mine, we had a walk-on quarterback from

04:58.403 --> 05:04.410
Plainview taking in Bob Horn. They went to Naval 
Academy and started a quarterback there in the

05:04.430 --> 05:10.397
fall of 1949. And Bob Lane, my roommate and I, were 
hitching, and our suitemates from Hearn came by

05:16.859 --> 05:21.423
and they had a two-seat coupe. And they said, well, 
if we would ride the truck, and if we would go by to

05:22.885 --> 05:32.995
see Hearn play Franklin on Friday night, they 
would take us to Dallas in the coupe, in the trunk of

05:22.885 --> 05:32.995
the coupe. We said, that's a deal. And we got in the 
trunk of the coupe and drove up to Franklin and saw

05:35.417 --> 05:41.723
the Hearn-Franklin football game and got back in 
it. And we put a two-by-four to hold it back. They

05:45.607 --> 05:46.748
lived openly. Well, we hit a bump, and the 
two-by-four went flying, and the lid came down,

05:47.437 --> 06:16.937
and it wasn't dangerous or anything like that, but 
the guy driving the car named Lawson or Cornforth,

05:47.437 --> 06:16.937
kind of gigantic pull-in for guys, he pulled in and 
told the attendant to check his spare tire, you

05:47.437 --> 06:16.937
know, and the attendant opened it, and it was three 
bodies, and all of them were pretty big guys, and he

05:47.437 --> 06:16.937
opened that thing, and there were three bodies, 
and he jumped back, But we drove up to Ornby and saw

06:17.542 --> 06:22.949
the game at Ornby Stadium. And

06:22.969 --> 06:27.596
yeah, we went on court trips. And of course, you 
know, I'm sure you write and meet the girls from

06:27.676 --> 06:37.129
TSCW there in Dallas at the court trips. And one 
time I met a very fine girl there named Pam Burgess,

06:38.230 --> 06:45.080
who had apparently a skill, a pretty good pianist. 
She had played in Boston and going She played in the

06:47.191 --> 06:49.934
Governor's Mansion. And when I say this, there's 
nothing of color in any of this. The thing I would

07:01.445 --> 07:14.498
say about A&M then and A&M today, the surface 
morality was much higher then than it is now. But

07:14.866 --> 07:17.950
the spirituality is much greater now than it was 
then. There was much more real commitment today to

07:19.192 --> 07:25.861
spiritual things than there was then. It was a kind 
of a surface. Everybody is Christian. There's a

07:30.187 --> 07:34.834
Christian country, so you're born into 
Christianity, cultural rather than personal.

07:36.536 --> 07:44.367
And on those court trips, as you all marched down 
the street and so forth, how did the observers

07:36.536 --> 07:44.367
respond? a very patriotic era. Later on, I knew a 
mother who said she always wanted her son to come to

07:49.613 --> 07:53.521
A&M. She had two sons that went to Baylor, and they 
were athletes. And her third son came to A&M, and

07:57.348 --> 08:01.496
she was thrilled that he didn't go to Baylor. They 
were from Waco. And he's an athlete called for him

08:03.139 --> 08:05.223
at A&M now. And she wanted, because it was 
patriotic. And everybody in the 30s in that time,

08:08.292 --> 08:16.546
well by the time I got here of course we were in the 
war, but in the 30s everybody knew we were going to

08:08.292 --> 08:16.546
soon be in war. And the advantage of A&M also at that 
time was getting the reserve commission gave you

08:17.828 --> 08:27.224
an extra degree of economic security. When my dad 
was on CC duty, we knew a lot of graduate engineers.

08:34.280 --> 08:39.708
who until they were called active duty were 
pumping gas to put money into the family. They were

08:39.748 --> 08:47.680
just literally out there and servicing cars, 
changing oil and things like that as graduate

08:39.748 --> 08:47.680
engineers. But they were called active duty as 
lieutenants and captains. And it was another

08:51.266 --> 08:57.034
security element for them. And A&M grew in 
enrollment. The golden years of A&M in many ways

08:59.598 --> 09:02.042
was that late 1930s with the war coming on and the 
Depression and cheap education. Describe, if you

09:07.906 --> 09:20.118
can, that fall semester or the summer, first 
Silver Taps and then Bonfire as it was held then in

09:07.906 --> 09:20.118
those days. Silver Taps was held whenever any one 
individual was killed, died, or something. And it

09:26.725 --> 09:32.130
was very similar to what they do today, except 
probably just as somber and you know, and the one

09:32.853 --> 09:45.953
thing that I pictured as different is they had the 
silver taps from the top of the academic building

09:32.853 --> 09:45.953
and then another one further away and then another 
one further away, so you've got an echo effect. Oh,

09:46.053 --> 09:46.413
really? Yeah. It was very, very, very, much more 
moving than it is today, because they'd play, this

09:47.595 --> 09:55.146
one would start and then this one would start and 
then that one would start. You'd turn out all the

09:55.547 --> 10:00.835
lights and things like that, and we'd all march, we 
would March down there, it was something you would

10:01.608 --> 10:05.192
go to. Did anybody not take it seriously? Nothing, 
no. No pranks? No pranks. And when you got back to

10:10.958 --> 10:14.583
the dorm, appropriate seriousness?

10:17.145 --> 10:17.486
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't recall any, and if 
somebody said something, I mean, I'm not saying, I

10:17.506 --> 10:21.430
just don't. I've never heard of any. Now, Bonfire 
was in the drill field, and we'd go out, and we'd cut

10:23.432 --> 10:30.180
the logs, We had no moving equipment, except 
trucks. Were there some logs in 44? Yeah. Oh,

10:37.808 --> 10:38.569
really? Yeah, we'd go out and cut the logs. And my 
shoulders got scraped and everything else. We'd

10:43.776 --> 10:46.961
hold them on our shoulders, carry them to the 
truck, put them on the truck. The truck would bring

10:46.981 --> 10:49.004
them here, and then we would bring them in. And it's 
just a TP effect, one layer. About how long

10:53.070 --> 10:57.856
chronologically did you all work on the bonfire? A 
week, a month? I'd say a week and 10 days. Not that

11:00.856 --> 11:02.658
long. All right. And so they had quit by 1944. They 
had quit putting trash wood. Yeah. There was some

11:09.404 --> 11:14.369
trash on it, but basically it was a teepee effect of 
trees. Of logs. Because, see, in the late 30s, they

11:15.230 --> 11:23.798
used quite often the wood crating and so forth from 
the railroad. Right. It was a burning up of trash.

11:26.080 --> 11:26.181
Yeah. All right. So it's held on the drill. But the 
thing is that we did not have a crange to lift up.

11:30.545 --> 11:30.745
Yeah. all that stuff. We don't understand why they 
can't go back to that. It was relatively safe. Who

11:37.201 --> 11:38.923
did the cutting? Freshmen. Freshmen. I think we 
did, but I know we did the carrot. And you used

11:45.508 --> 11:46.970
two-man saws? Yeah, and axes. And axes. Do you 
remember any injuries? No, except scratch on

11:50.913 --> 11:55.297
Ray's shoulders. But nobody got a leg cut off or a 
hand or anything like that? There ain't no power

11:58.740 --> 12:00.141
saws. Did anybody attempt any kind of pranks, any 
outsider, with Bonfire? What year was that that

12:06.583 --> 12:09.167
the Texas tribe had come over? Oh, no, that's 
later. That's later. That's the only thing I

12:11.330 --> 12:12.672
remember, no. It would have been worth somebody's 
life if we were friends. I mean, it was... What were

12:16.558 --> 12:21.085
you all told that Bonfire symbolized? What did it 
represent? We didn't make a big deal out of it,

12:24.971 --> 12:27.615
really. Nothing. Was there much of a crowd? A long 
time. No, I mean, just cadets. All right, then you

12:33.739 --> 12:39.487
go home at the end of the semester, which would have 
been late January. Well, I didn't go home. See, I

12:40.889 --> 12:41.931
went to the Marines. No, but the semester is over, 
and you reported for active duty. Yeah, active

12:48.541 --> 12:49.923
duty to the Marines. All right, briefly summarize 
your active duty service. Okay, I went to the

12:54.530 --> 12:58.275
Marines, and they gave me the... responsibility 
of getting about six guys from San Antonio to

12:58.576 --> 13:11.529
Atlanta, Georgia with an eight day, eight hour 
layover in New Orleans and I sweated that one out

12:58.576 --> 13:11.529
getting back on that train in New Orleans. I went to 
Atlanta. In Atlanta they put us on another train. I

13:16.514 --> 13:26.845
lost my responsibility and my authority and 
became another Munich and we went to Parris Island

13:16.514 --> 13:26.845
and there they put us on cattle cars, bus, 
semi-trucks, and drove us in to Parris Island,

13:27.213 --> 13:38.408
where we were met by a legend in the Marine Corps in 
World War II, covered in Time magazine, Sergeant

13:27.213 --> 13:38.408
Lou Diamond. And he was a goatee to the guy, using 
all kinds of profanity and everything else. I was

13:45.517 --> 13:55.310
six feet three, weighed about 155 pounds, and was 
in excellent shape from my freshman year at A&M,

13:45.517 --> 13:55.310
from running mile and seven-tenths and other 
things that we did here. And... The biggest

13:57.689 --> 14:22.937
adjustment I had in boot camp was I was taken out of 
my socioeconomic level, geographic

13:57.689 --> 14:22.937
socioeconomic level, and thrown in with a bunch of 
people that were totally different culturally

13:57.689 --> 14:22.937
from me, all the way from an illiterate from 
Alabama, whom I was supposed to teach the General

13:57.689 --> 14:22.937
Orders, and I said, First General, take charge of 
this post. When we took charge and I had to try to

14:23.272 --> 14:39.300
explain to him, they pulled him out, thank 
goodness, to people from the scum that scraped off

14:23.272 --> 14:39.300
the streets of New York City, real scumbags. And 
the language they used was different from what

14:39.681 --> 14:44.249
I've been used to. I never heard the word scum. The 
name of Jesus Christ taken as an oath, you know, it

14:46.053 --> 14:56.087
was something we, damn hell, a lot of other things, 
but not, that was not something you would use in the

14:46.053 --> 14:56.087
South. You never heard said that. I was designated 
a acting squad leader by, platoon leader, you'll

15:00.433 --> 15:11.248
be interested in this, was one Shelby Foote, who 
had a strange background. He had been cashiered

15:12.110 --> 15:15.334
out of the Army as a captain. I don't know if you know 
this about Shelby Foote. No. He had something

15:19.497 --> 15:23.141
happen in North Ireland. In the height of the war, 
he had been booted out of the Army as an

15:23.161 --> 15:29.849
uncommissioned officer and was dragged to enlist 
in the Marines as a private. I wonder if that's in

15:30.169 --> 15:32.693
the standard biography of Foote. No, I don't think 
so. I called him and just talked to him a little bit,

15:34.855 --> 15:39.241
you know, after I got my doctorate in history. But 
he, and then presumably there were B-12 types

15:39.381 --> 15:46.249
who'd been bumped out of B-12 programs or 
something. How well prepared had your A&M

15:46.482 --> 15:52.735
experience made you for those responsibilities? 
Oh, very much so. Very much so. Particularly, I

15:56.482 --> 15:58.707
gained 30 pounds at Marine Corps boot camp. 
Physically, it was very easy. Psychologically,

16:01.092 --> 16:06.803
having to adjust to the new culture was pretty 
tough. When I was at Bukank, they called me over and

16:07.188 --> 16:11.173
said, we're going to go to second phase. After 
second phase, would you be interested in going to

16:11.233 --> 16:15.739
Japanese language school, which studies your 
tests? And by

16:15.779 --> 16:26.092
this time, the romance of the Marine Corps and the 
adventure had kind of worn off. And I like to be a

16:26.233 --> 16:28.255
student. I like to go to school. I love to go to 
school. And yeah, I'd be interested in it. I went to

16:33.850 --> 16:37.115
second phase training, which was good. It was not 
bad. And then they asked me to, I had to go before a

16:38.176 --> 16:43.944
board to tell them why I wanted to go to Jet League. 
And I lied like a trooper and talked my way into it,

16:44.065 --> 16:56.162
where apparently a fellow by the name of Robert 
Bork was there at the same time, because I heard

16:44.065 --> 16:56.162
them ask him, where were you when the atomic bomb 
went off? And he said, Japanese language school in

16:56.598 --> 16:59.382
the Marine Corps in Cancun, June. And that's where 
I was. And very small, so I had to see him. But we both

17:02.367 --> 17:05.812
came to probably 50 pounds since those days. He 
wasn't a best friend, don't misunderstand me. But

17:07.975 --> 17:09.197
I didn't know him. He must have been there. I must 
have seen him. And then after the war was over, as

17:11.641 --> 17:21.135
soon as the war was over, I forget that going to 
Japan and speaking the language. I said, I want to

17:21.155 --> 17:22.677
get out of this. And so I went. flunked out of 
Japanese language school, to put it bluntly. I

17:28.617 --> 17:30.981
didn't try at all. And so then they sent me to combat 
intelligence school, then I went to Quantico,

17:31.001 --> 17:39.895
rifle range coaching school, I was always, they 
kept putting me in school. Then finally, in a

17:39.915 --> 17:50.230
brigade, first special marine brigade, we went on 
maneuvers down off of Puerto Rico, out of Calibra,

17:39.915 --> 17:50.230
then on Puerto Rico. And then they brought us back 
up on the transport into New York Harbor, sailed up

17:55.542 --> 17:58.785
Hudson River to 125th Street. And in order to get 
$300 mustering out pay, rather than $200, you had

17:59.746 --> 18:08.936
to be overseas for one month or more. And they kept 
us on that boat for 32 days, for two days over a

18:10.638 --> 18:15.263
month. Of those two days, we were on the boat, 
theoretically. But we were in New York for eight

18:19.868 --> 18:21.530
days. Four days, they let us have leave. And then 
the other two days, they gave us overnight passes.

18:28.142 --> 18:32.026
So out of those eight days, six days was a leave or 
pass. And you go into New York and get free tickets

18:33.048 --> 18:53.511
to South Pacific, Big Dog Baby, Red Mill, free 
tickets to baseball games, Yankee baseball

18:33.048 --> 18:53.511
games,

18:33.048 --> 18:53.511
nickel hot dogs, free Pepsi Cola in Times Square. I 
stayed at the Taft Hotel at 42nd Avenue and 7th

18:54.368 --> 19:05.125
Avenue and 42nd Street. 7th Avenue and 42nd 
Street. And the room was $7 a night. Vincent Moe

19:09.713 --> 19:15.322
plays, playing for your dancing pleasure in the 
ballroom, $7 a night. And I remember I... Got on the

19:19.225 --> 19:20.607
subway. It was an elevator at that point, 125th 
Street, Old Morrison, Texas. And I never thought I

19:25.293 --> 19:28.838
was on anything going so fast when I went down 
underground. You know, it's so close, it's going

19:28.858 --> 19:31.461
by. And I got off at 42nd Street and Broadway, a 
junction there, and got up and knew where the

19:32.262 --> 19:43.277
tagged hotel was. A fellow from up in that area told 
me about the tag. And I walked up to it, got there,

19:46.107 --> 19:50.312
and I said, can you tell me where Times Square is? 
Because I'd been listening to radio at Little

19:51.113 --> 19:54.437
Theater on Times Square and all this thing. And I 
figured it was just kind of like Alhambra or like

19:54.938 --> 20:03.488
Camelot or something, just a gorgeous, glorious 
place. And they said, well, where did you come

20:03.508 --> 20:04.770
from? I said, I got off at Subway right

20:04.810 --> 20:10.977
there. And they said, well, you walked right 
across it on the way here. And all I saw was orange

20:14.373 --> 20:17.918
juice sales and things like that. And so it was 
funny. And so then I went back to Quantico,

20:20.743 --> 20:30.518
Virginia, and waited out until my points built up 
and got discharged. And when I was in, and when I

20:30.538 --> 20:35.926
was, my wife will get it. When I was in, for a while I 
was a transient and had no assigned duties. And

20:41.835 --> 20:43.317
they'd keep us busy. And I got to be perfect at 
avoiding that. We'd fall out about four ranks. I

20:48.433 --> 20:52.176
always get the last rank, have a clipboard, and 
then call my name. As soon as they called my name,

20:52.396 --> 20:55.559
I'd be all the way here. I'd step back one step, walk 
along the formation all the way, very official

20:55.579 --> 21:08.732
looking, not try to hide, walk right in front of all 
the non-coms, and go over to the library and the

20:55.579 --> 21:08.732
snag bar. They were in the same building. And read 
and listen to the jukebox and listen to... Doris

21:13.486 --> 21:23.736
Day sang Sentimental Journey and dreamed about 
getting on that train, counting every mile of

21:13.486 --> 21:23.736
railroad track that takes me back to Texas.

21:24.036 --> 21:28.500
But I got to be really good at avoiding these make 
jobs. But I didn't get in trouble. I read

21:29.742 --> 21:32.184
trigonometry. It was a history of Texas 
government in the West. It was the first time I

21:37.189 --> 21:40.032
heard of John Wesley Hardin. When I came home, I 
asked my grandfather, Paudie, did you ever hear of

21:43.135 --> 21:44.957
John Wesley? Oh, no, I saw him. And I think he's 
dead, too. He said he and his father were coming

21:48.642 --> 21:57.153
through, and John Wesley was riding a horse, and 
his father was driving a wagon that came down to a

21:48.642 --> 21:57.153
ford here across the Brazos River. And there was a 
deputy sheriff there. And the deputy sheriff

22:00.958 --> 22:04.543
pretended he didn't recognize John Wesley 
Horton. And so he didn't try to do anything, and he

22:05.404 --> 22:10.290
went peacefully on his way. Now, was this the Aggie 
grandfather? Grandfather, yeah. Now, did he tell

22:14.307 --> 22:18.872
you anything about his attitude when you became an 
Aggie? Did he say anything to you about A&M? The

22:20.774 --> 22:31.026
only thing he had said, that if any grandson of his 
ever became the captain of the Texas A&M football

22:20.774 --> 22:31.026
team, he would give them 200 acres of land. Now, his 
great-great-grandson

22:31.046 --> 22:38.995
started for... the Aggies in the Cotton Bowl 
against Auburn. His name was Wiley. He was his

22:45.144 --> 22:59.009
son's daughter's, his son's, no, his 
granddaughter's, his son's son's daughter's

22:45.144 --> 22:59.009
son. Randy Wiley started at guard.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.422
under Jackie Sherrill. But did he ever say to you 
that it was important to be an Aggie, or really? He

23:15.249 --> 23:16.451
didn't need to. Okay. Now, in fact, we, you know, 
and I talked to, when I was at William & Mary, there

23:17.111 --> 23:26.762
was a, I really thought I could have gotten in and 
get some back here. Here I was an Aggie. I was not

23:28.204 --> 23:30.907
really proud of my history degree for me. I knew 
that I was going to why I thought this. And then I had

23:35.274 --> 23:39.980
a master's from when I was in the Army from 
Hardin-Simmons. And it ended up William and Mary,

23:40.000 --> 23:41.902
they were all Ivy Leaguers. And I walked in and saw 
John Shelby there. And I walked in the door and he

23:47.308 --> 23:52.254
said, what are you going to write your 
dissertation on? What's the topic of your

23:52.294 --> 23:53.755
dissertation? And I didn't even know what he was 
talking about. I didn't start talking. Words that

23:57.980 --> 24:00.623
I had not yet formed in my historiography. And I 
didn't know how to pronounce it either. And it was

24:03.586 --> 24:06.509
really bad. They said, go over and see Dr. Brown, 
Richard Maxwell Brown, over in the library. And I

24:14.198 --> 24:17.822
thought, well, Selby's PhD from Brown. Brown's 
PhD from Harvard. I can't talk to a guy from Brown. I

24:22.367 --> 24:24.810
haven't ever talked to a guy from Harvard. And I 
went over there, knocked on the door, came in. He

24:27.933 --> 24:29.695
said, oh, you came from Abilene, Texas. I said, 
yeah. He said, did you ever know him? high school

24:32.712 --> 24:34.835
football player there named Jack Mildred. Yeah, 
yeah, you know him. He showed me another magazine

24:37.479 --> 24:39.201
called Texas Full. He said, I've got every copy 
that's ever been printed out of the house here. It

24:42.606 --> 24:48.013
turned out he was a big aficionado for Southwest 
Conference and Texas high school football. And

24:48.033 --> 24:49.676
while I'm talking to him, the phone rings. He's the 
expert witness on... Extra-legal violence in

24:54.211 --> 24:59.798
support of community values before the select 
committee of the Senate. And I knew that couldn't

24:59.818 --> 25:01.560
be hurting this. We're about the same age. He was 
looking at me and getting this great compliment

25:02.842 --> 25:06.967
and recognition of his expertise. And we're 
talking about this great conversation. So it was

25:08.910 --> 25:10.712
really good there. But it was fun. Way off the 
topic. You get discharged. When? I got discharged

25:17.120 --> 25:19.864
on August the 13th. of 46. And back in school 
September of 46. And so you're one of those, one of

25:27.069 --> 25:32.934
that large, large group of veterans. 9,000 
students. Compare what it was like to arrive in 46

25:34.956 --> 25:41.622
with what it had been like to arrive in 44. I was 
coming home. I was coming home to A&M. I felt very

25:47.807 --> 25:49.108
much At home, okay. I literally, while I left home 
in 44, I was coming, when I came to A&M, I was coming

25:52.489 --> 26:01.257
home in 46. Were there many of the folks that you had 
been with in 44, were many of them back also? Oh,

26:12.186 --> 26:14.569
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And what outfit were 
you in? I was in a veteran's outfit. I came back I was

26:20.695 --> 26:22.177
a sophomore academically. I signed up and got a 
contract in ROTC. I was a junior in ROTC, and I had

26:26.805 --> 26:30.410
senior privileges. All my classmates were 
seniors. All the people who come into Fort Worth

26:32.894 --> 26:36.941
were, by now, because of the accelerated program, 
seniors. So I was a senior. So for three years, I was

26:39.124 --> 26:42.430
a senior at A&M. But I never was a, with privilege, 
never was a sophomore or junior. Freshman to

26:46.777 --> 26:47.698
senior. So where were you assigned in terms of 
dormitories? First I was in a veteran's outfit.

26:54.748 --> 26:55.309
And where were you? Then I went over on the core 
staff and joined the outfit of our classmate of

26:55.349 --> 27:03.439
mine, Country Higgins, football's four-year 
story, football was killed in Korea. Where were

27:05.000 --> 27:06.122
you? We were in the new area, the quad. I moved from 
those two buildings right up on Duncan. First

27:14.311 --> 27:15.873
semester I was over here. Second semester I was I 
mean, then I moved over to E Infantry and was in

27:17.817 --> 27:21.542
there. But you were in a veteran's outfit, but you 
all still marched to chow? No. Oh, you didn't? No.

27:27.651 --> 27:29.253
What did you all wear? I was saying we wore, I wore 
the pinks, just what seniors wore, except I never

27:29.273 --> 27:40.709
bought boots. People didn't wear, the seniors 
didn't wear the boots in those days the way they do

27:40.729 --> 27:44.635
now. Now, and nobody messed with you veterans? No. 
No pranks, no jokes? No. Nothing like that? No, no.

27:54.103 --> 27:55.965
Where did you all eat in the dining hall? Did you eat 
as a unit? Well, they changed everything by that

27:58.487 --> 28:00.969
time, too. Because they had so many civilian 
veterans here, they had cafeteria style. Oh,

28:07.835 --> 28:08.375
okay. And I think I did that. And the campus was 
crammed with people, wasn't it? A campus. The

28:13.927 --> 28:15.009
campus was crammed. They had no campus housing. 
They moved, they closed Bryan Air Force Base and

28:19.777 --> 28:25.467
put freshmen out there the next year, I guess. And 
it was packed and they had to digest all these

28:26.229 --> 28:31.919
veterans. And the married veterans lived... They 
moved in some housing. over there where the Hensel

28:37.906 --> 28:44.192
apartments are in that area there, made 
apartments out of old barracks as they moved in

28:37.906 --> 28:44.192
there. They put in a lot of barracks. I don't know if 
they did in the war, but they did, exactly. And

28:48.977 --> 28:51.960
over— South of the football field? No. Oh, no. Over 
near the water tower? Over near the water tower.

28:57.406 --> 29:05.154
And where the engineer and where the physics, the 
cyclotron and all that is over in that area,

28:57.406 --> 29:05.154
generally speaking. And also I took classes over 
there. Now, did you and your fellow veteran

29:07.657 --> 29:12.202
buddies feel more mature? We were more mature. We 
were more mature. When I came back, classroom work

29:16.927 --> 29:21.473
was like falling off a log. First time, first time I 
came back, I was worried about it. I wanted to do

29:25.637 --> 29:27.419
better than I'd done before. I took 15 hours. 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. ROTC drill on

29:32.125 --> 29:33.947
Thursday afternoon. Kept Saturday free as much as 
I could. and wanted anything to it. And so you made

29:41.435 --> 29:42.777
good grades. Made good grades, twice, you know. 
Who were some of the, you're a history major now.

29:47.724 --> 29:48.304
History major. And who were some of the history 
faculty? Well, we had, and I'll use what we called,

29:50.968 --> 29:57.376
I don't know the first name, Screaming Al Nelson. 
Wait, and describe why they had those nicknames.

30:01.902 --> 30:06.368
Well, Screaming Al Nelson, Screaming, his first 
name was Al, A-L-A-L. And you could hear him

30:07.023 --> 30:11.468
throughout the academic building when he was 
teaching. And I did not have him for a lot of

30:11.528 --> 30:16.394
courses, maybe for one course. But you could hear 
him all over the building. And one of them did have

30:21.500 --> 30:24.203
Arshter Gaumann. Now, Arshter because he . 
They're teaching. And he had a unique way of

30:29.248 --> 30:33.233
teaching that you had a reading assignment. And 
you came in, and you'd sit there. He'd ask a

30:36.487 --> 30:46.299
question and call somebody and make a mark in his 
thing, in his grade book of some kind, if you

30:36.487 --> 30:46.299
answered the question correctly or not. And 
that's the way he talked. I also had a Dr. Hill, who

30:49.903 --> 30:53.948
left here at the University of Texas, who was... 
John Hill. Yeah. In retrospect, a good American

30:54.789 --> 31:02.298
historian, and he was one that really challenged 
me, I thought. Did you have Ralph Steen? I had him, I

31:04.540 --> 31:06.122
think, for one course. one semester for, I think it 
was a government course.
