WEBVTT

00:04.688 --> 00:09.214
You don't think that Truman then had much 
knowledge about the situation? Well, if we think

00:09.314 --> 00:16.263
back there, he inherited an awful lot of things in a 
mighty short time. On a world scale in just a day.

00:20.309 --> 00:31.624
Things going on in that particular theater at that 
time were, I'm sure, not his top priorities by any

00:20.309 --> 00:31.624
means.

00:32.178 --> 00:45.360
So I don't really blame the Truman 
administration, but all of the smoke was there and

00:32.178 --> 00:45.360
building on up to the McCarthy-Bearer problem. 
Were there particular senators or congressmen,

00:45.461 --> 00:51.912
though, that you would place some of the blame on, 
just your own personal opinion? Oh, hell yeah.

00:54.175 --> 00:55.077
Sure, sure. There are.

00:59.937 --> 01:04.544
I need to look at that a little more closely before I 
go start naming names. Okay, fine. But, yes, there

01:06.767 --> 01:09.010
had to be. Because you were right there on the spot, 
and I was wondering what you and your men felt was

01:09.030 --> 01:15.078
going on. Or you had just come back from China, and I 
was wondering what Brigadier General would think

01:15.519 --> 01:28.898
when he came back to America and saw what was going 
on with the Nationalist Army over there. Well, it

01:29.266 --> 01:31.749
just about killed me, I can tell you that. Because I 
knew those people, and we had worked hard to move

01:33.171 --> 01:36.816
them. When you start flying a division, 1,100,

01:37.757 --> 01:50.093
1,200 miles, I'm putting it down.

01:54.680 --> 01:59.467
That gets to be a really rough job, and we flew 
almost half a million troops. So we're not talking

01:59.948 --> 02:01.691
about peanuts. We're talking about a big deal.

02:09.163 --> 02:13.930
I wish I came back here to the joint staff. I was 
senior air planner on the Joint Chiefs of Staff in

02:15.412 --> 02:22.223
Washington when I came from this job. And that's 
when all that was happening over there.

02:29.256 --> 02:33.621
So it was a little hard to tell you. How about a quote 
while we rest? All right, fine. Let's have a quote.

02:39.128 --> 02:40.490
Okay, now let's continue. On February 46, you went 
back to the United States, and at that time you were

02:41.271 --> 02:49.020
a general. about how you learned that you were 
appointed a general? Yes. When I, while I was in

02:57.905 --> 03:19.665
India, and actually in headquarters in Calcutta,

02:57.905 --> 03:19.665
General Stratmire had recommended that I be 
promoted to Brigadier General, and forwarded

02:57.905 --> 03:19.665
this out through, you know, Stilwell Theater and 
on back to Washington.

03:22.295 --> 03:30.945
And

03:22.295 --> 03:30.945
it seemed that things were going on all right.

03:35.330 --> 03:50.547
But General Cure, who was Air Staff A-5 here in 
Washington, which was Assistant Chief for Air

03:35.330 --> 03:50.547
Staff Plans, passed through India.

03:53.969 --> 03:56.352
and stopped and talked to me. Of course, planning 
was one of my functions there.

04:02.841 --> 04:05.684
And we talked at length about plans. We had worked 
together in the years before that and knew each

04:05.724 --> 04:10.250
other very well.

04:13.935 --> 04:21.445
I told him about a plan that I was working on and my 
planner was working on.

04:22.353 --> 04:28.481
in which we really made CBI an air theater. And 
about the only thing that we used ground forces for

04:30.664 --> 04:42.058
was to guard the ports and air drones and a few 
things and we carried the war by air.

04:44.761 --> 04:50.048
And this was just a draft plan that we were working 
on. But he said, how about letting me have a copy of

04:51.125 --> 04:54.550
it? So I did. I didn't see any problem about that.

05:00.999 --> 05:10.773
On his way back to Washington, after he finished 
his other business over there, he read the plan and

05:00.999 --> 05:10.773
he thought it had quite a bit of merit to it. So he 
took it and gave it to General Handy. General Handy

05:15.600 --> 05:16.862
was

05:19.373 --> 05:25.780
head of the operations division of the War 
Department General Staff. A really fine,

05:25.800 --> 05:27.742
wonderful man. And General Handy liked that plan. 
And

05:31.325 --> 05:43.218
for some reason he asked General Stilwell about 
some things that were contained in that plan. And

05:43.278 --> 05:45.280
of course General Stilwell knew a damn thing So, I

05:46.508 --> 06:03.452
got called out of bed one night about two o'clock in 
the morning by General Stratt. I was living in, we

06:03.512 --> 06:11.063
were all living in the same house in the compound.

06:11.083 --> 06:15.469
He stood me up in my pajamas and really dressed me 
down like a corporal. that

06:16.799 --> 06:30.078
John Stilwell had called him and just absolutely 
raised hell with him and told him to get his ass down

06:16.799 --> 06:30.078
to Stilwell's headquarters down in downtown 
Calcutta. So, and he, of course, didn't know a damn

06:31.740 --> 06:44.578
thing about it, and he went down there and found out 
that Stilwell

06:31.740 --> 06:44.578
was mad because this plan had gotten back into 
Washington when he didn't know anything about it.

06:48.170 --> 06:53.681
Well, I hadn't tried to undercut anybody or 
anything else. It was just that I had it in draft.

06:55.484 --> 06:58.470
Larry wanted to see it, I let him have it, and then it 
got back here. But still weren't wearing it back

07:00.454 --> 07:04.702
here anyway until John Marshall told me to take my 
name off the lip.

07:07.688 --> 07:10.313
So something had to be done in a pretty quick hurry.

07:13.685 --> 07:17.511
I got hold of Larry Cuter, told him what had 
happened. So he went then to see John McNorney, who

07:18.693 --> 07:25.082
was General Marshall's deputy.

07:27.807 --> 07:34.898
And

07:27.807 --> 07:34.898
John McNorney looked into it and got the facts one 
talk with General Handy. So when the subject came

07:35.799 --> 07:42.409
up with General Marshall, John McNorney took my 
side of the cake.

07:46.743 --> 07:58.019
John Marshall knew me too, and when all the 
controversy, the chatter was over there, he just

07:46.743 --> 07:58.019
pushed it over the side of his desk and kept on 
moving. And it went on, it went on through.

08:04.387 --> 08:06.270
If John McNarney hadn't been able to be there, know 
the facts, and say what happened, or I probably

08:08.360 --> 08:15.089
would have just been pulled from that lift. And of 
course I never would have gotten back on any lift.

08:20.576 --> 08:25.083
So you were really delighted then when you learned 
that you were going to receive a star? Oh yes. I

08:26.945 --> 08:34.135
guess

08:26.945 --> 08:34.135
you never know the significance of a little thing. 
While I was in in Cairo at the Sexton Conference.

08:41.983 --> 08:55.904
In the planning side of the house, I had some 
contact with John Handy, who was the top plan for

08:41.983 --> 08:55.904
the War Department and for the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff at that time. And I told him about some things

08:55.924 --> 09:05.518
in India, and particularly having to do with the 
Burma Road, and how we might could do a better,

09:07.372 --> 09:10.936
better approach there. Well, he thought enough of 
it that he asked General Marshall and General

09:12.438 --> 09:24.592
Arnold to have lunch with us that day in the Manor 
House and at the Pyramids in Carroll where we were.

09:27.616 --> 09:33.042
But they did, and I laid out my plan on the table.

09:36.481 --> 09:40.166
General Arnold said, I believe it, I think it's 
right. I have fought the problem

09:42.369 --> 09:52.423
all the way to the top twice, I've lost it, and I'm 
not going to fight it anymore. We've got a plan to do

09:53.725 --> 09:57.510
it, let's follow the plan. But General Marshall 
remembered my presentation of the thing. General

10:04.180 --> 10:05.121
Marshall A wonderful man, a really wonderful man. 
I don't know when I've ever known anybody, ever

10:11.974 --> 10:17.902
been around anyone at that time. I was so impressed 
with John Marshall. Why do you say that?

10:25.613 --> 10:27.956
He was big, really big. Thought big, acted big.

10:35.645 --> 10:46.102
but with every ounce of compassion, integrity, 
kindness, love, and patriotism that anyone could

10:35.645 --> 10:46.102
have.

10:49.648 --> 10:51.030
Just a wonderful man. Do you remember later on in 
his life when Senator McCarthy

10:51.050 --> 11:01.888
labeled him Either a stooge or a traitor for the 
Communists? Yes, I do. What was your response?

11:12.292 --> 11:17.139
I almost feel obligated to kill anybody that we 
categorize them that way. I mean, I feel that

11:17.319 --> 11:20.984
strongly about it. I didn't agree with what 
General Marshall did in his capacity as the

11:21.004 --> 11:30.458
peacemaker over there.

11:33.475 --> 11:39.540
But, I didn't have the instructions that General 
Marshall had when he went over there, either. To

11:41.342 --> 11:41.943
China? Yeah. I think what General Marshall did 
over there, he did pursuant to the instructions

11:43.744 --> 11:50.871
that he had when he went there.

11:52.552 --> 12:02.301
And as I said, with the China lobby and whatnot back 
in the United States, it was during that same time

11:52.552 --> 12:02.301
that these supplies didn't get there.

12:06.854 --> 12:21.004
General Marshall was not soft on any communism or 
anything else that was a threat to America's

12:06.854 --> 12:21.004
freedom, and he knew damn well communism was such a 
threat. He would be the last thing on his agenda, I

12:21.084 --> 12:27.698
tell you. After the Second World War, some people, 
some officers were reduced when one, or sometimes

12:29.197 --> 12:40.132
even two, but especially one grade in the rank. 
Were you concerned that you might be reduced down

12:40.693 --> 12:44.498
to colonel? Well, yes, I was concerned, since with 
one exception I was the youngest general officer

12:44.518 --> 12:53.149
that I knew of. I think I was the youngest. How old 
were you? Let's see, I guess I was 34 by that time.

13:14.379 --> 13:16.442
So, you became a Brigadier General at age 34? 33. 
That

13:17.223 --> 13:23.352
is incredibly young. And

13:24.158 --> 13:36.631
there was one officer, and he actually was over in 
China, who was made a general up to, I think he was

13:24.158 --> 13:36.631
28, Casey Vincent.

13:39.294 --> 13:45.901
And he came back to the States and was reduced back 
to town. So I think I was the youngest. And I knew

13:48.523 --> 13:53.068
many others that were being reduced. You could say 
one or two, two grades. And sure, I was concerned,

13:57.153 --> 14:07.642
but what the hell, you couldn't do anything about 
it anyway, except the best you could, so I just

13:57.153 --> 14:07.642
didn't worry about it. And the job that I was given 
when I got back here was a proper job for a Brigadier

14:07.662 --> 14:20.254
General, and so the Air Force left me in that grade 
and pushed me into that job. At that time when you

14:20.504 --> 14:29.577
returned to the United States, this was a period of 
heavy demobilization and a lot of people were

14:20.504 --> 14:29.577
getting out and getting into civilian life. Did 
you ever consider going, after the war, going into

14:29.637 --> 14:33.282
civilian life? No. After I got my, after I was 
accepted a regular commission in 1938, I

14:34.443 --> 14:48.503
determined then that I was going to make a career 
out of the Air Force and I just Quit worrying about

14:49.040 --> 14:52.765
the other things. Okay, now let's turn to your job 
that you held for three years, February 1946 to

14:52.785 --> 15:06.181
June 1949, the air planner for the Joint Strategic 
Plans Group for the JCS. The Joint Chiefs of Staff

15:06.261 --> 15:15.773
had

15:06.261 --> 15:15.773
three groups. at that time. The Joint Chiefs of 
Staff were relatively new then, just hadn't

15:19.275 --> 15:24.042
started functioning in the war.

15:27.126 --> 15:36.800
The Joint Strategic Plans Group, the Joint 
Logistics Group, and the Joint Strategic Survey

15:27.126 --> 15:36.800
Committee. This Joint Strategic Survey 
Committee was a group of Army, Navy, and Air Force

15:36.820 --> 15:46.013
and Marine officers, very senior officers, and 
they reviewed very large worldwide problems and

15:47.073 --> 16:00.990
prepared positions for the chiefs on those. The 
Joint Strategic Plans Group prepared, number

16:02.331 --> 16:13.705
one, war plans for future use, and also plans on any 
current or foreseeable situation requiring

16:14.596 --> 16:34.423
a military position by the Joint Chiefs. One of the 
first things that I started working on, as a matter

16:34.443 --> 16:41.413
of fact was already in the mill when I got there, The 
plan for the trusteeship of the Pacific Islands,

16:42.153 --> 17:02.532
where some of the islands were strategic 
trusteeships, and well it's a very large, very

16:42.153 --> 17:02.532
large problem, a very large paper. And it was one 
that I spent an awful lot of the early months

17:02.552 --> 17:07.716
working on. Like areas like Tarawa and some of 
those? Some of those were British islands too,

17:11.785 --> 17:14.568
weren't they? Yes, some were British, some were 
German, some French, all kinds.

17:22.677 --> 17:38.755
What we did was really kind of whip them all 
together, give them the closest thing, usually

17:22.677 --> 17:38.755
give them to independence, and yet retain the kind 
of entree to them that we would need to to defend

17:40.118 --> 17:50.129
them as well as take care of our own security in the 
Pacific. So they all became a part of a large

17:50.569 --> 18:00.340
trusteeship, which we proposed we would be the 
trustees. And then we... designated some of them,

18:05.228 --> 18:23.310
particularly important ones, as strategic 
trusteeships in which the right was recognized to

18:05.228 --> 18:23.310
conduct military operations and build military 
facilities and this sort of thing. Then you had to

18:23.330 --> 18:27.375
set up a governing mechanism for that.

18:30.940 --> 18:34.324
I'm still very proud of the whole plan, except for 
one thing, And

18:35.384 --> 18:47.779
like we do with the poor people in the United 
States, anytime we want to help them, we set up a

18:35.384 --> 18:47.779
plan that takes care of them. And as soon as you 
start taking care of somebody, he becomes a ward,

18:47.979 --> 18:54.027
and then he breeds more wards. And the first thing 
you know, you're up to your ears in a welfare kind of

18:54.047 --> 18:59.974
a situation. And we were so good to all the peoples 
of the trusteeship, they have become wards, and

19:01.253 --> 19:12.247
now they're costing us a lot of money for not much 
return. I'm not happy about that aspect of it, but

19:12.307 --> 19:18.996
everything else I am a bit happy about.

19:19.016 --> 19:21.719
How do you think we could have resolved that 
problem differently?

19:26.426 --> 19:29.510
About there being wards, you mean? Yes. Same way 
we're going to resolve it in the United States.

19:35.323 --> 19:48.676
Situations are going to get so bad that people have 
to take care of themselves or kick the damn bucket

19:35.323 --> 19:48.676
and then they'll get busy taking care of 
themselves.

19:48.776 --> 19:55.763
I think as long as they can sit on their backside and 
howl and somebody comes and brings the bucket with

19:48.776 --> 19:55.763
some food in it, they'll howl. When the guy stops 
bringing the bucket, pretty soon they'll get up

19:57.802 --> 20:04.570
and start stirring around a little bit. In the 
meantime, they'll threaten you about the

20:04.590 --> 20:12.920
communists and threaten you about the devil and 
about anything else that you think of. An honest

20:15.444 --> 20:20.590
answer to your question, I don't know, but I think 
really that is the answer. You're going to have to

20:20.630 --> 20:24.134
make them do for themselves or starve. Same as 
you're going to have to do to us. Now as the air

20:27.586 --> 20:32.774
planner, what particular problems did you have? 
During this time for these three years, it's one of

20:34.756 --> 20:48.076
the most dynamic times in American foreign 
policy, and we're going to talk about a lot of these

20:34.756 --> 20:48.076
things that happened and what impact they had on 
plans, but were there internal problems that you

20:34.756 --> 20:48.076
faced? Internal armed services, you mean? Yes, 
there were some really severe internal problems,

20:52.142 --> 20:57.289
some that Of course, one of the big ones, I would 
imagine, is the Army and the Air Force breaking

20:57.944 --> 21:02.790
away. Yes, that was not as big as some others. What 
were some of the others? That was a big one. Well,

21:09.417 --> 21:27.698
right after the war,

21:09.417 --> 21:27.698
I guess

21:09.417 --> 21:27.698
it had three things that had happened that opened a 
lot of people's eyes and opened a lot of new

21:09.417 --> 21:27.698
horizons. Atomic energy had come into being, of 
course. And it had come in as an air weapon, the

21:32.702 --> 21:36.908
first application of it.

21:40.073 --> 21:52.652
Air power had demonstrated its potential in such a 
manner, it demonstrated it before, but this time

21:40.073 --> 21:52.652
nobody could argue about it. So, everybody wanted 
it. You didn't have to sell yourself anymore as an

21:56.230 --> 21:59.855
airman.

22:02.698 --> 22:05.421
You had to just keep from being taken over by 
somebody.

22:09.727 --> 22:22.002
The other thing,

22:09.727 --> 22:22.002
in spite of the glory and all of the Battle of 
Ladygolf and whatnot, the total effects of the

22:09.727 --> 22:22.002
war, said to you that the surface maybe as such just 
doesn't have any place left in the world

22:22.387 --> 22:47.280
as a combat unfair

22:22.387 --> 22:47.280
i don't i don't mean by that that you won't ever have 
any more submarines or anything like this but uh

22:47.530 --> 22:53.359
Battleships and cruisers and these kind of 
things, they're fresh out. You couldn't build

22:54.641 --> 23:01.411
them as fast as somebody could sink

22:54.641 --> 23:01.411
them. Air Force was trying to get out from under. It 
had been for a long time.

23:08.461 --> 23:16.153
Long enough that I was already long before this one 
up for court martial twice on the subject.

23:21.652 --> 23:48.165
And so everyone in moving forward from there was 
trying to put their best foot forward in terms of

23:21.652 --> 23:48.165
having the responsibility

23:21.652 --> 23:48.165
for air power operations of any type allocated to 
their service, the Army, Navy. and of course Air

23:48.449 --> 23:54.898
Force fighting to be a separate force and not to let 
all those things be taken away.

23:58.022 --> 24:05.433
And as far as Navy is concerned, I guess the thing 
peaked in the B-36 controversy.

24:09.178 --> 24:11.000
All of which was kind of silly. The B-36 didn't have 
a hell of a lot to do with it. It was the a mighty fine

24:16.698 --> 24:23.907
piece of equipment for what it made for, but by the 
time we're talking about it here, it's already ten

24:16.698 --> 24:23.907
years out of date. But it served as a vehicle to get 
all these things all mulched up and out of focus

24:26.150 --> 24:34.660
before the public and the Congress. And to make 
some real enemies out of, between Air Force and

24:36.603 --> 24:44.292
Navy, Naval Aviation in particular.

24:47.647 --> 24:55.755
And so anything you did on a joint planning, as soon 
as you got to the air power part of that plan, you

24:47.647 --> 24:55.755
were going to have a hell of a fight. And you had to 
fight with the Navy and you had to fight with the Air

24:57.577 --> 25:03.082
Force. The Marines kind of acquiesced because the 
Navy agreed they could keep their limited amount

25:04.904 --> 25:15.595
of air, and that's all they wanted anyway, so they 
had relative peace, but the rest of us didn't. And

25:16.908 --> 25:23.995
so that permeated this whole three years of 
fighting on the joint staff. Nuclear-wise,

25:24.015 --> 25:32.884
of course, everybody wanted to be supreme in the 
nuclear thing. The Navy wanted to drive its ships,

25:32.904 --> 25:41.633
to drive its airplanes, to be the best in the 
delivery of the weapons and everything else. and

25:42.592 --> 25:47.518
of course the Air Force knew that that was its 
destiny and it would have it. The Army couldn't be

25:48.439 --> 25:50.021
left out. It needed its short range missiles, its 
guns, which it got of course. And the big fight in

25:57.649 --> 26:08.802
there between the Air Force and the Army was over 
domination of the intercontinental And who was

26:09.288 --> 26:12.351
going to dominate it? The Air Force won out on that 
one, primarily. It doesn't mean the Army can't do

26:18.837 --> 26:23.142
it, but they won that battle. And I think we won on 
the Navy, too, because we outperformed them.

26:33.652 --> 26:37.776
This is what made it so hard for me as the commander 
of the Joint Task Force going to detonate the first

26:39.713 --> 26:46.824
nuclear weapon at high altitude as commander of 
the task force. I had to go pick an Army missile to

26:47.545 --> 26:55.739
carry my warhead up there because the Air Force 
didn't have one.

26:55.759 --> 26:58.904
That must have caused a lot of friction. Well, it 
caused an awful lot of people in the Air Force to

26:58.924 --> 27:02.970
feel mighty hard at me. because of course the 
people who had the Air Force missile were quite

27:05.498 --> 27:10.223
confident it could get there. I had to be more than 
quite confident. I had to be god damn near certain.

27:17.009 --> 27:25.117
And the only reason the Army had one is because they 
brought Bonbon and his V-2 over here and it was that

27:17.009 --> 27:25.117
V-2 rocket that I used to put it up there.

27:28.861 --> 27:29.742
Well we're going to get to that. I was interested in 
Besides the Intercontinentals and the B-36

27:33.595 --> 27:47.934
controversy,

27:33.595 --> 27:47.934
what impacted the Russian atomic bomb in 1949 
having the Air Force? The Russian? When Russia

27:51.479 --> 27:53.982
exploded their atomic bomb in 1949.

27:56.665 --> 27:57.887
Did that change the plans? That's really awfully 
hard to say. No, I don't think so. It put more

28:01.962 --> 28:05.347
urgency on some things. Remember this took 
everybody by surprise. Our experts said that they

28:09.492 --> 28:12.356
weren't going to have one until about 1960. Yes, 
but we didn't all share that. Oh, you didn't? No, we

28:18.064 --> 28:18.785
didn't. I didn't for one. I was in the, by that time, 
in the atomic energy business.

28:31.983 --> 28:34.066
John Vandenberg didn't share that view.

28:42.237 --> 28:45.642
I think there were a number that didn't share it. 
So, when they got it, it wasn't as much of a surprise

28:46.403 --> 28:55.595
to us as a question of what is the best thing to do in 
light of that fact. We didn't have a ballistic

28:57.037 --> 29:01.804
missile that could get there. And that's when we 
sat down with Bennett Shriver and said, we've got

29:02.189 --> 29:14.660
to make some compromises and then not change our 
mind. And so that gave birth to our first

29:16.362 --> 29:28.553
intercontinental, truly intercontinental 
missile that could carry a significant warhead.

29:29.253 --> 29:30.535
And we went ahead with it. And we had it in time.

29:35.011 --> 29:48.183
We had it before the Russians could really take 
advantage of their newfound strength, even in the

29:35.011 --> 29:48.183
sense of posing a real threat.

29:51.947 --> 30:03.077
But Schriever did a damn good job of getting that 
rocket warhead combination together and getting

29:51.947 --> 30:03.077
it on the launch pads.

30:05.200 --> 30:14.973
So I think that probably that was the biggest 
effect I had strictly on Air Force, not on the U.S.,

30:05.200 --> 30:14.973
but on the Air Force. Sure. And that was urgency. 
Yeah. And

30:18.778 --> 30:27.510
we, I think, were relatively well prepared to go 
ahead. And nobody was well prepared with all the

30:27.610 --> 30:33.177
reduction in funds and whatnot we'd have. Oh, 
yeah. but we were prepared to go ahead. The other

30:37.422 --> 30:59.355
thing I think it did, the other impact that it had 
indirectly on the Air Force was

30:37.422 --> 30:59.355
evident in that day in July, I believe it was, 49 
when Truman said we were going ahead with the

30:37.422 --> 30:59.355
hydrogen bomb.

31:02.525 --> 31:06.849
At that time I was in the military liaison 
committee. I was out of the joint chief.

31:13.616 --> 31:17.640
So I wrote the draft press release that the 
president turned loose that afternoon. Did you?

31:22.745 --> 31:23.246
No kidding.

31:26.389 --> 31:32.295
The general advisory committee to the Atomic 
Energy Commission. had been meeting, well,

31:32.596 --> 31:38.283
for several days. And they had made their 
recommendations to the President through the

31:40.646 --> 31:47.134
commission, of course.

31:50.478 --> 31:54.283
And I was the Executive Secretary of the Military 
Liaison Committee, which was a group that's

31:55.445 --> 32:06.456
supposed to protect the interests of, or 
represent, not protect, the interests of the

31:55.445 --> 32:06.456
Department of Defense with the Atomic Energy 
Commission. And the chairman of that committee

32:08.939 --> 32:17.708
was a man named Webster, Bill Webster,

32:08.939 --> 32:17.708
who was president of New England Power and Life. 
He's the guy that put the Yankee one, Yankee two

32:19.910 --> 32:24.675
reactors in up there later on.

32:27.558 --> 32:42.580
And Bill was going over with the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs and Secretary of Defense

32:27.558 --> 32:42.580
and Chairman of the Commission.

32:45.444 --> 32:54.257
And had met with the President the day before on the 
problem to present the, or to let the Chairman of

32:45.444 --> 32:54.257
the General Advisory Committee present their 
views.

33:02.294 --> 33:09.562
And so they were going back again this time and go 
over the thing with the President and he was going

33:02.294 --> 33:09.562
to, hopefully he was going to make a decision.

33:13.767 --> 33:17.171
So the five of them were going over to the White 
House. I wrote up the draft press release on the

33:17.251 --> 33:23.839
basis that he was going to say, yes, we are which I 
thought he was, I'm going to say,

33:25.034 --> 33:34.907
and went along with Bill over there to the White 
House to the meeting. Now, I didn't go in the Oval

33:35.268 --> 33:40.575
Office where they were meeting at that time, but I 
was just outside the door. And when the President

33:40.695 --> 33:44.680
announced his decision in there, But Bill came out 
and I gave him the draft press release and the

33:46.077 --> 33:54.010
president came to the door and read it and said, 
yeah that's right, roll it. So, we went from there.

33:58.136 --> 34:13.941
And that was a great day, I thought, because we 
almost did not go ahead with that because of all

33:58.136 --> 34:13.941
the guilty consciences, I think, that people had. 
Like the General Advisory Committee. Okay, now

34:18.481 --> 34:21.425
one of the guilty conscience, of course, was 
Oppenheimer. Well, it was right there. He was one

34:23.368 --> 34:25.031
of them. And what was your, what was your, you know, 
he's a so-called father of the A-bomb. Of course,

34:30.298 --> 34:37.067
he isn't a father, but he was one of the men 
instrumental in the development of the atomic

34:30.298 --> 34:37.067
bomb, and he was against the H-bomb. What was your 
feeling toward him? Well, I guess that's probably

34:43.672 --> 34:49.060
the hardest question that you could ask.

34:52.606 --> 35:03.103
I got to know Oppenheimer when he was head of or 
member of the General Advisory Committee and when

34:52.606 --> 35:03.103
I was in the MLC. I got to know him a lot better than 
that with the passage of time. After I left that

35:10.807 --> 35:25.554
job, I went to defense as director of the Atomic 
Energy Committee of the Research and Development

35:10.807 --> 35:25.554
of the Department of Defense, under the Secretary 
of Defense. And Appiah was chairman of that

35:27.477 --> 35:35.211
committee, so I worked directly for him during 
that period of time.

35:39.511 --> 35:44.799
And my job, of course, to keep the damn place 
running. I mean, that wasn't his occupation. He

35:47.102 --> 35:50.527
was coming there on part-time doing these things. 
Mine was to keep it, conceive the programs, get

35:51.689 --> 36:02.484
them approved, and get them implemented, and have 
the services and whatever other agencies of the

35:51.689 --> 36:02.484
government were involved do them. So I

36:02.505 --> 36:08.353
didn't know what I was doing.

36:13.733 --> 36:29.152
Arthur, I believe, had the most brilliant brain of

36:13.733 --> 36:29.152
any one that,

36:13.733 --> 36:29.152
that I would possibly have known.

36:32.596 --> 36:39.184
It may have been so brilliant that I don't even know 
it, that I don't even know what it was thinking, you

36:32.596 --> 36:39.184
see. I know this sounds silly, but I think it was 
that way.

36:49.462 --> 37:02.978
I think he saw in his own mind so far down the road of 
history here, and he did things today that fit that

36:49.462 --> 37:02.978
pattern a hundred years from now in his mind.

37:07.379 --> 37:22.426
Now, I'm not sure how you do this, because I've 
never tried to make my daily actions conform to

37:07.379 --> 37:22.426
something that I think will be or ought to be 50 or 
100 years from now. So I'm not sure whether it takes

37:22.446 --> 37:27.014
a brilliant mind or not, but I would certainly 
think it does. And I believe that's what he did. And

37:30.440 --> 37:32.323
I think he did a damn good job of it.

37:40.336 --> 37:58.304
He always did or seemed to try to do the very best for 
the United States in the problem at hand, meaning

37:40.336 --> 37:58.304
its immediate effect. Whether he was trying to do 
the best for it in the long range, I have some very

37:58.324 --> 38:04.453
serious questions in my mind.

38:08.129 --> 38:18.459
because I think what he had in mind was a society, an 
objective in mind was a society that does not now

38:08.129 --> 38:18.459
exist. Neither ours, nor the communist, nor 
socialism, or anything else.

38:31.031 --> 38:34.795
And it was never possible for me to get a clear 
enough picture of what that society was in his mind

38:35.028 --> 38:45.681
to frame it into something I could see.

38:50.206 --> 38:59.297
But that feeling was always there after a year's 
association with him, for example.

39:02.467 --> 39:06.491
and he was very genuine and very sincere about 
everything.

39:09.374 --> 39:31.377
Yet,

39:09.374 --> 39:31.377
in that way of mind, there seemed to be a, an

39:09.374 --> 39:31.377
area, naive area that either things just weren't 
important to him, or that he had no thought

39:32.858 --> 39:46.758
experience about, that he just let shine,

39:32.858 --> 39:46.758
didn't make any difference.

39:46.778 --> 39:57.533
In his earlier

39:46.778 --> 39:57.533
trials and tribulations with the Atomic Energy 
Commission over the clearance problem, he had no

39:59.757 --> 40:07.889
brilliant man would do the things that he did that 
caused the question on his security clearance.

40:10.272 --> 40:16.741
And yet he never did see that it was stupid, or he 
certainly never did acknowledge it. So why the

40:18.684 --> 40:20.667
hell did he do it, you see? If I take that little 
problem, it didn't turn out to be so damn little,

40:21.649 --> 40:27.537
but relatively and translate it up here to these 
bigger things, it looks still the same way, you

40:28.225 --> 40:32.971
see. How come he thinks just this way? Because he 
doesn't tell you, no more than he defended why he

40:35.814 --> 40:41.221
did it then.

40:44.705 --> 40:46.928
So, I really never did know. I don't know right now, 
just exactly what to think. As a physicist, he was

40:52.134 --> 40:55.498
certainly a brilliant man, no question about 
that.

40:58.448 --> 41:22.988
And if you look at what, try to put a little more 
meaning into what I'm saying here, if you take his

40:58.448 --> 41:22.988
position on the H-bomb,

40:58.448 --> 41:22.988
I know he knew, in retrospect I know he knew, that it 
was physically possible to do it. that certainly

41:24.790 --> 41:33.161
we could get fusion and we could make it work and we 
could control it.

41:33.181 --> 41:42.493
He must have known that we couldn't sit here and not 
do it and have the Russians do it and hold it over our

41:33.181 --> 41:42.493
head. He just must have known that. He never said 
that, but he must have. So, why did he take that

41:46.759 --> 41:48.722
position? Is it because he feared retribution by 
God? I don't believe so. I don't believe he

41:55.123 --> 41:56.404
believed any of that.

42:00.068 --> 42:07.775
So, you just end up with a bunch of damn questions 
and not many answers. So, I don't know. Did you ever

42:08.516 --> 42:20.127
have, I mean, working for him like that, did you 
ever ask him straight out, why do you support your,

42:08.516 --> 42:20.127
how do you support your position? It never, the 
answer is yes, I have, a lot of times, but I'm

42:20.258 --> 42:30.188
talking about something factual, something 
immediate. And he always had a rational answer.

42:32.790 --> 42:38.976
And sometimes I agreed with it, sometimes I 
didn't, but it was at least on the basis of tangible

42:32.790 --> 42:38.976
things that you could consider.

42:43.440 --> 42:49.506
You ask him about these kind of long-range things 
that I'm talking about, or philosophical things,

42:50.819 --> 43:03.599
he could look right at you and talk a whole batch of 
sentences and not tell you a goddamn thing and move

42:50.819 --> 43:03.599
on to the next problem.

43:03.619 --> 43:07.665
And without your feeling that he was trying to be 
deceptive. I don't know yet whether he was or not.

43:12.733 --> 43:14.936
He was a very complex man. How was he as far as an 
administrator? No, he wasn't. He didn't profess

43:22.835 --> 43:24.798
to be an administrator. He didn't really want to 
be. How was he dealing with people? With his peers?

43:34.030 --> 43:38.436
Okay.

43:38.636 --> 43:48.990
I think you have to, when they ask that about that 
particular man, that particular time, we have to

43:38.636 --> 43:48.990
look at one, remember one other thing. and it 
sounds maybe even unbecoming of me to mention it.

43:54.973 --> 44:10.495
But right after the bomb went off, an atomic fusion 
had been achieved by the United States, and it had

43:54.973 --> 44:10.495
won the war in the Pacific.

44:15.423 --> 44:20.530
The people who had worked on it, who had mastered 
this And

44:20.830 --> 44:27.260
they would do a lot of credit. It was a wonderful 
job. But they had not had any praise.

44:37.335 --> 44:38.296
And they were hungry. And they drank it in. And they 
became a fraternity. And if you were a member of

44:48.083 --> 44:51.569
that fraternity, brother, you could do no wrong. 
If you were not a member of that fraternity, it

44:52.750 --> 44:59.020
didn't make a damn what you thought. Nobody 
listened. You couldn't even speak their

45:02.286 --> 45:03.948
language. Well, it was at that point, under that 
circumstances, that I entered the field, not a

45:06.452 --> 45:13.804
member of the fraternity.

45:17.480 --> 45:34.996
And after five

45:17.480 --> 45:34.996
years, I guess, or six, I'll have to check it, of 
working with the military side of the nuclear

45:17.480 --> 45:34.996
business, I became the general manager of the 
Atomic Energy Commission. The great scientists

45:35.036 --> 45:45.445
are wonderful people,

45:35.036 --> 45:45.445
and even though they are members of this exclusive 
fraternity, they get hungry just like everybody

45:45.914 --> 45:48.516
else does. They like to have three meals a day and 
ride airplanes and all kinds of things. So they

45:53.501 --> 45:54.342
need some money. The Atomic Energy Commission was 
the only place they had to get any money at that

45:56.544 --> 46:02.369
time. So they at least have to be civil to the guy who 
gives them the money. So I got to know a lot of them.

46:14.585 --> 46:22.195
some very well, and some of them very wonderful 
people.

46:22.215 --> 46:33.350
But I got to know a great deal about the motives and 
egos and all the other things that make them tick.

46:33.370 --> 46:36.394
I didn't remember all kinds of funny things about 
them. One of the most wonderful people in that

46:38.396 --> 46:43.663
fraternity is one that didn't to create such a 
fraternity to be the last thing he wanted to do. And

46:49.899 --> 46:51.902
I haven't heard from him in about a year. I don't 
know whether he's still alive or not. Dr. Eugene

46:54.184 --> 46:57.448
Wigner from Princeton.

47:01.253 --> 47:02.615
Absolutely wonderful man. Wonderful physicist 
and scientist, but also a very wonderful man. He's

47:10.905 --> 47:12.807
the one that when they were working
