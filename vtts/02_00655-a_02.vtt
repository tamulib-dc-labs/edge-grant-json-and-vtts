WEBVTT

00:11.168 --> 00:33.480
Well,

00:11.168 --> 00:33.480
one of the most interesting things about 
perception is a statement by Dr. Rainey, who was a

00:11.168 --> 00:33.480
Special Assistant for Science in the Assistant 
Secretary's office, plus the fact is now Chief

00:11.168 --> 00:33.480
Scientist for Office of Naval Research, denies 
that I or anybody else ever attempted to

00:11.168 --> 00:33.480
consolidate the oceanographic program in 
Washington, and we That is the biggest crock I ever

00:33.933 --> 00:45.705
saw because we tried to, we knocked heads together 
during Tex Treadwell's time to set up the Maury

00:33.933 --> 00:45.705
Center and put the research and development 
physically at the Naval Research Laboratory and

00:33.933 --> 00:45.705
stuck it in some buildings. And then I guess things 
sort of went downhill, but we never got it

00:45.725 --> 00:50.450
completely done. Because if that had been done, 
we'd have never had any reason to even look outside

00:50.910 --> 00:55.075
of Washington. Because anybody would rather have 
his own organization in his backyard than to have

00:55.095 --> 01:03.163
it, for example, over in a place that is far remote 
from where he's getting his dollars. And in fact,

01:04.274 --> 01:06.096
we even called it the Maury Center. We even hired 
Dr. Hersey from Woods Hole to try to pull it

01:06.898 --> 01:09.882
together. And we never really pulled it together. 
And I hope we can do it this time. Because I think

01:14.968 --> 01:17.171
this is our last chance to pull it together. 
Exactly what would you like to put all together?

01:20.536 --> 01:25.302
I'd like to put every bit of ocean science together 
under one single manager in the Navy. Now, I am not

01:25.483 --> 01:27.345
one of those people. want to take university 
academic research and put it under single czar.

01:31.315 --> 01:33.898
And when Bill Nuremberg told me this, I said, look, 
Bill, you're crazy. You want to come to Ed Snyder,

01:34.619 --> 01:38.644
and if I say no, I can't fund you, you don't want to be 
able to go to anybody else? I said, you've got the

01:38.664 --> 01:40.126
best of both worlds now. You've got three people 
you can go to. You can go to Guy Stever, Ed Snyder, or

01:41.328 --> 01:44.412
Bob Abel. Bob Abel runs the Sea Grant program. Dr. 
Stever up until recently ran the National Science

01:46.855 --> 01:54.345
Foundation, and I theoretically ran, and I always 
use the word theoretically because in the Navy

01:46.855 --> 01:54.345
you're never sure who runs what. the Navy's 
effort. If you put it under one individual,

01:56.318 --> 02:01.825
scientists don't like to knock at one door and not 
have another door to go to. And I think that people

02:01.885 --> 02:13.440
who argue that there are 21 agencies plus in 
oceanography don't know what they're talking

02:01.885 --> 02:13.440
about in university research because right today 
it's probably the best coordinated program in the

02:01.885 --> 02:13.440
federal bureaucracy. In fact, it may even be too 
well coordinated. It's coordinated basically

02:16.203 --> 02:22.932
through my being double-hatted to the National 
Science Foundation and to Dr. Hughes where the two

02:23.367 --> 02:36.326
of us look at both programs together, and then Bob 
Abel, who used to be the executive secretary of the

02:23.367 --> 02:36.326
ICO for whom we used to work together, having such 
an interrelationship that I seriously doubt if

02:23.367 --> 02:36.326
you'd want to really take science and coordinate 
it any better. Science, I'm talking about, basic

02:37.067 --> 02:38.710
science. Now, the Navy's definition of ocean 
science is weird compared to yours because the

02:38.790 --> 02:45.840
Navy's runs even into operational money. It just 
happens to divide its program into science,

02:45.900 --> 02:49.806
engineering, operations, and prediction. But 
when I have to be careful of my words,

02:52.831 --> 02:59.985
nomenclature, because to use science as 
university, to the Navy that's called basic

02:52.831 --> 02:59.985
research 6.1, and to somebody else it's called. 
But we're talking about the work done in

03:00.005 --> 03:02.129
universities. And my position has been, since 
I've been involved in this program and still is,

03:07.343 --> 03:16.692
that the basic research being done in the 
universities and the academic world and

03:07.343 --> 03:16.692
nonprofit organizations of this country in 
oceanography can best be done there. And I

03:17.533 --> 03:37.333
maintain a very small capability to do that 
internally within the Navy because I think the

03:17.533 --> 03:37.333
rewards and the incentives in the academic 
community are greater physically in the

03:17.533 --> 03:37.333
university or the nonprofit than they are within a 
Navy industrial type laboratory, even though we

03:17.533 --> 03:37.333
have basic research, as we call it, done in our 
laboratories. The reason that I'm trying to

03:37.786 --> 03:50.281
consolidate that group with the people working on 
the in-house group is to ensure that the people in

03:37.786 --> 03:50.281
the academic world have some feel for what the 
Navy's needs are. The Navy still can provide, even

03:51.382 --> 03:57.970
though it doesn't look like it's providing much 
dollars, it still has almost 400 ships. It almost,

03:58.210 --> 04:02.595
I think, something over 100 at sea every day. over a 
hundred and thousand people at sea every day, if I

04:02.896 --> 04:19.715
can somehow use some of this to help us solve our 
problems, because in addition to the great

04:02.896 --> 04:19.715
scientists, the problem in oceanography is the 
lack of capability for collecting information,

04:02.896 --> 04:19.715
and I'm trying to use the operational Navy to 
collect information. I'm building a, I've

04:20.476 --> 04:29.747
abolished the weather service, I've changed its 
name, I've physically taken it and put it at this

04:20.476 --> 04:29.747
center down in Mississippi to Because the other 
end of those people are not dollars, but they're

04:30.065 --> 04:46.142
1,600 and some enlisted men and officers riding 
around in aircraft carriers on admiral staffs and

04:30.065 --> 04:46.142
at fleet weather centrals whose only job is to 
predict the environment and to forecast it,

04:30.065 --> 04:46.142
taking the information. And if I can use those and 
somehow escalate their capability along with the

04:46.182 --> 04:54.511
scientific community, I'd sort of use them as a 
negative feedback loop. They're out there where

04:54.531 --> 04:56.032
the user is. The difference between the Navy... 
for example, in the foundation, and I'm also

04:57.908 --> 05:04.590
double-hatted at NOAA, is the Navy is a user of its 
own science. The National Science Foundation

05:05.232 --> 05:09.245
just does science for science sake. And I'm not 
being critical. and perhaps some people say

05:11.999 --> 05:18.305
science for science sake, but I mean science in 
order to be able to move forward and

05:11.999 --> 05:18.305
understanding. But they're not going to use the 
science themselves. The rest of the country will

05:21.048 --> 05:24.031
probably use it or somebody else. NOAA would like 
to say, and they always tell me that they are

05:24.512 --> 05:30.397
producing oceanography for a reason. They are, 
but the reason is not for themselves. They don't

05:32.920 --> 05:36.343
depend on oceanography in any sense as a user. They 
collect information, bring it together, and give

05:36.784 --> 05:41.428
it to other people to use it. The Navy 
theoretically uses everything it does. I think an

05:45.294 --> 06:02.959
interesting thing is the Navy not only uses what it 
does, but the Navy uses what the Foundation does,

05:45.294 --> 06:02.959
and the Navy uses what NOAA does, because WODC, the 
World Oceanographic Data Center, and the

05:45.294 --> 06:02.959
National Oceanographic Instrument Center were 
in fact owned by the Navy during the time that I was

05:45.294 --> 06:02.959
physically in the Washington Arena. Didn't go 
back, didn't go out of the Navy until I think 1971

06:02.979 --> 06:08.547
when Nixon reorganized and formed NOAA. I think 
the big critical things coming up now in the future

06:13.036 --> 06:20.605
in oceanography are the so-called engineering 
and undersea technology in the development cycle

06:13.036 --> 06:20.605
because of the oil interest and because of the 
other thing. And I think the universities have

06:20.685 --> 06:24.058
been significantly helpful in this area and yet 
cannot afford to run the kinds of programs that

06:25.102 --> 06:33.257
demand huge pieces of systems and equipment. And 
yet I think perhaps Woods Hole, and believe it or

06:33.878 --> 06:43.296
not, even Texas A&M, now with their advent of, I 
believe, putting the Perry Cub Marine and getting

06:33.878 --> 06:43.296
engineering-wise, are probably the two most 
advanced in what I call engineering. Scripps

06:47.542 --> 06:52.728
would get very upset in Miami and all the rest of 
them, and they would say, well, putting out buoys

06:47.542 --> 06:52.728
in engineering. That's not what I mean. I mean 
undersea technology, the ability to operate at

06:53.509 --> 07:08.085
any depth, at any time, at any place in the world's 
ocean, which is my objective, my military

06:53.509 --> 07:08.085
mission, and I never will achieve it as long as I 
live or my son lives, but I'd sure give it a healthy

06:53.509 --> 07:08.085
college try. And that's costly because that 
demands huge systems, long development times,

07:09.196 --> 07:17.687
and large expenditures of money, even more so than 
Oceania. Now, in 1953, let's say, when you arrived

07:20.130 --> 07:30.664
and looked over the bureaucratic organization in 
Washington, when were you first struck that

07:20.130 --> 07:30.664
consolidation had to take place? I'm being 
unfair. You seem to be a consolidator all along

07:32.404 --> 07:37.351
because the assistant secretary asks you, what 
would you do? And you say, I would consolidate or I

07:37.391 --> 07:41.055
would abolish it. Do you usually look at problems 
this way? Yes, I guess I do. I guess I have a weakness

07:45.641 --> 07:49.526
of always wanting to get a critical mass. I guess my 
disgust with science, my disgust with anything

07:49.586 --> 07:57.917
I've ever done is that to watch various people 
doing little bits and pieces and realize that that

07:58.488 --> 08:00.170
it lacks a critical mass. And you don't 
necessarily have to consolidate to get a critical

08:00.230 --> 08:03.474
mass. But you can't run a three-man post office 
department in science or engineering and

08:04.375 --> 08:10.282
everybody tries to do it. It takes a certain amount 
of manpower. And this doesn't mean they all have to

08:12.004 --> 08:14.206
work for one boss. And this doesn't mean they all 
have to be under one roof. But it means they all have

08:16.389 --> 08:18.151
to be pulling together. And it's very difficult to 
get people pulling together unless you

08:18.792 --> 08:24.418
physically put them together or you let them meet 
all the time. And in the academic world, I think

08:24.478 --> 08:28.343
we've been very fortunate, certainly up until 
very recently, of being able to get them all

08:28.593 --> 08:35.225
working together and meeting together, but not 
necessarily working together geographically.

08:35.706 --> 08:44.762
But they're being forced to work together in large 
sea experiments geographically because nobody

08:35.706 --> 08:44.762
can any longer afford to do his own experiments. In 
a sense, the system is driving it that way. And I

08:47.286 --> 08:49.450
look at that as the word critical mass. And maybe 
that's because of my nuclear physics background.

08:51.673 --> 08:52.855
But to me, that means something. That means it can 
run on its own. That means it can survive. That

08:55.840 --> 08:58.284
means it can, in fact, recreate and generate. It 
can, in fact, create matter. Now, that's my

09:00.728 --> 09:06.598
layman's view of what I mean by critical mass. And 
I'm concerned that in oceanography, we tend to...

09:11.354 --> 09:13.638
to have a lot of little isolated groups. But I do not 
think this is a problem in the academic

09:13.658 --> 09:20.548
oceanography, but it's certainly now a problem in 
the engineering side of oceanography. Terrible.

09:21.009 --> 09:26.318
I have a follow-up question on that I intend to ask 
later from something you said previously, but

09:21.009 --> 09:26.318
you're now like that. Does it not seem to you that 
such things as 200-mile limits, international

09:26.338 --> 09:33.008
conferences, In effect, that oceanography has, 
world oceanography, has become more and more

09:32.988 --> 09:41.359
involved in the political realm with the 
development of third world powers? Absolutely.

09:42.781 --> 09:48.208
Does that seem to work against your idea of 
creating critical masses? Yes, it does, because

09:48.228 --> 09:55.958
there are lots of people in the bureaucracy that 
like to isolate things by how you do them as opposed

09:48.228 --> 09:55.958
to specific disciplines. I think the 
oceanographic community and the Navy in

09:56.900 --> 10:04.532
particular were very remiss not to forecast what 
was going to happen with the 200-mile limit. I

10:05.314 --> 10:07.177
certainly know that Dr. Wakeman did. I know we did 
in the Secretary's office. We were just basically

10:08.979 --> 10:10.903
not listened to. We really weren't prepared for 
this. I think that the... The interesting part of

10:16.373 --> 10:29.129
oceanography, again, which is again unique in the 
scientific sense, and this speaks to the

10:16.373 --> 10:29.129
international sense, is that what happens on the 
coast of Africa may very well affect what happens

10:16.373 --> 10:29.129
on the coast of North America. Now, you can trap me 
here and maybe I'm in the wrong realm of current

10:29.730 --> 10:38.601
flow and basin flow and theory, but certainly my 
statement in general is true. And this basically

10:39.391 --> 10:42.217
says that you have to work together. It doesn't 
mean you have to do it under the United Nations,

10:42.498 --> 10:46.166
under a single organization. But again, you're 
going to have to have at least a group of people that

10:46.206 --> 10:56.269
have subcritical mass so that when they can 
survive on their own and at the same time they're

10:56.485 --> 10:58.507
they can gain by working together with someone 
else. And this has been our big push in scientific

10:58.547 --> 11:13.885
academic oceanography to ensure that the world 
does not think of these people as exploiters, but

10:58.547 --> 11:13.885
rather as people who are trying to explore and lay 
the basis for their own benefits. We can't just

11:14.826 --> 11:20.552
say, I want to look at what's off my own coast and try 
to figure out what effect it's going to have on the

11:20.735 --> 11:30.910
atmospheric weather, on where the fish go, where 
are the minerals, how do we get the best

11:20.735 --> 11:30.910
point-to-point transportation. I think we 
certainly should have learned in this country by

11:31.210 --> 11:39.703
now, we may never have learned it, but you don't 
move large masses of things by air. The McNamara

11:39.843 --> 11:48.936
philosophy of everything's done by air, it was 
disproved certainly in Vietnam where still 98% of

11:39.843 --> 11:48.936
everything went by sea. You're moving tremendous 
tonnages of food, of petroleum products, of

11:49.726 --> 11:59.662
machinery, of equipment, and of course in the 
military also of ammunition. Now, it is better to

11:59.742 --> 12:16.408
move men by air and to move certain other things, 
but the Flying Tigers World War II bootstrap

11:59.742 --> 12:16.408
operation to carry 50 gallons of gas to get five 
there is not only inefficient, but it's almost

11:59.742 --> 12:16.408
impossible in modern technology. That's an 
opinion, but I think we're seeing the revival of

12:17.536 --> 12:24.186
the importance of marine transportation. And 
yet, interestingly enough, the politics of the

12:24.206 --> 12:38.788
merchant marine have been so sticky that 
everybody who's tried to look at how you bring

12:24.206 --> 12:38.788
consolidation together in the federal 
government has been afraid to tackle it. And I've

12:40.009 --> 12:43.054
been involved in almost every single tackling of 
it. consolidation or bringing things together or

12:43.523 --> 12:53.135
cutting up the pie that's been, it doesn't mean I'm 
running it, but I've certainly been involved in it

12:43.523 --> 12:53.135
as a staff member or as a guy sitting on the outside. 
Oceanography, of course, has been escalated to

12:55.057 --> 13:10.236
the White House, if you want to look at it that way, 
from the Humphrey era when he was chairman of what

12:55.057 --> 13:10.236
we used to call the Wet Space Committee, which is 
what the Marine Sciences Council. Another thing

13:10.576 --> 13:13.480
that, well, I guess that's it.

13:16.514 --> 13:24.753
Politics play a very important part in 
oceanography, and I guess I didn't realize that

13:16.514 --> 13:24.753
initially, because I'd never been thrown into 
politics until I got into oceanography.

13:29.163 --> 13:31.107
You can see why I get concerned.

13:33.973 --> 13:34.755
The world is negative. They'll cut you when you 
don't look at it.

13:40.358 --> 13:43.862
Well, I have a follow-up now on this idea of 
international cooperation. How do you as a Navy

13:43.922 --> 13:58.459
man, for example, feel about what seems to be, 
because of the need to bring a critical mass

13:43.922 --> 13:58.459
together, to use your word, they're growing 
international cooperation from the ships at sea.

13:58.479 --> 14:05.567
The Soviet Union, the Norwegians, the Americans 
have done more than just a few joint ventures,

13:58.479 --> 14:05.567
including Moho, for example. I don't have any 
heartburn with that. I guess perhaps many people

14:07.770 --> 14:09.572
do. But if you go back and analyze the history of 
going to sea in general, seamen generally fought

14:10.210 --> 14:18.362
as gentlemen and generally hated to fight. They 
were all after you, Alphonse, and they'd all stand

14:18.402 --> 14:23.349
off while two people battled it out. And I think the 
reason for that, again, is the environment. The

14:25.331 --> 14:35.766
environment was so destructive and so 
overwhelming that the respect for the

14:25.331 --> 14:35.766
environment was so great that people fought, if 
you will, gentlemanly wars. The thing that

14:35.806 --> 14:37.028
destroyed the The attempted to destroy 
gentlemanly wars were pirating back many, many

14:38.729 --> 14:48.418
hundreds of years ago, periodically, and that was 
finally, I guess the American Navy was the one that

14:38.729 --> 14:48.418
wiped that out for the rest of the world. Then the 
next thing that began to attempt to destroy the

14:49.319 --> 15:04.433
gentleman's agreement, as I call it, of how we all 
are bound together by the sea rather than by the

14:49.319 --> 15:04.433
national flag, was the advent of the submarine, 
who would stick his periscope up and fire

14:49.319 --> 15:04.433
indiscriminately at passenger ships and 
warships. That certainly has caused us a lot of

15:05.194 --> 15:07.656
problems, and Yet, on the other hand, that's 
perhaps maybe even brought us together on

15:07.973 --> 15:12.080
occasion. I think that seamen have historically 
been more afraid of the sea than they have of the

15:12.100 --> 15:17.789
enemy. Maybe that's an over-exaggeration. I 
think they've certainly been willing to sit down.

15:22.697 --> 15:34.437
I think there's another thing that many people 
don't recognize, and that is that if you are king of

15:22.697 --> 15:34.437
Xavier, say, for example, and I bring a ship in, I 
bring it in because I ask you if I may bring it in. And

15:35.092 --> 15:37.175
you as a gentleman say, well, certainly. But 
interestingly enough, I'm really not resident in

15:37.475 --> 15:41.219
your country. You can tell me tomorrow morning at 8 
o'clock to get my butt out and I can go. Whereas you

15:45.925 --> 15:52.173
might be reluctant politically to bring in an air 
group and put it in your backyard or an army tent

15:45.925 --> 15:52.173
because that's symbolic. Whereas the ship is 
merely tied by lines to your pier and is by law, a

15:52.193 --> 16:01.504
warship by law, is still sovereign territory and 
land of the country to which it belongs. So you're

16:02.968 --> 16:12.372
taking a piece of America and temporarily tying it 
up along the Xavier Principality or whatever

16:02.968 --> 16:12.372
country you have, and I think that This is 
particularly true in science. Now, when you get

16:16.083 --> 16:19.088
into hardware, then you're talking something 
else. Then you're talking competition for

16:19.168 --> 16:24.958
economic or other reasons which may be different. 
And I think you will find the biggest heartburn

16:25.640 --> 16:35.457
comes in sharing technology which may destroy you 
economically or militarily rather than sharing

16:25.640 --> 16:35.457
science. in the ocean. That's an opinion, but I 
certainly think that I have the full support of the

16:37.356 --> 16:48.612
hierarchy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 
Secretariat on fully supporting international

16:37.356 --> 16:48.612
science. There are many people who would not like 
to do this, but as far as policy is concerned, I have

16:49.373 --> 16:57.304
the full support, and I think that's an 
interesting thing because you wouldn't get that

16:49.373 --> 16:57.304
in other fields. I have another question that 
leads to about consolidation here. Would your

17:02.090 --> 17:05.595
plans of consolidation or your attempt to... and 
probably successful to move to Mississippi been

17:06.014 --> 17:10.259
possible without computers? Absolutely not. The 
thing that made a consolidation down there

17:12.461 --> 17:18.948
possible are two things, three things. Good air 
transportation, good computer tied-in systems,

17:20.290 --> 17:26.957
and good communication systems. In fact, we don't 
have the best communication system down there.

17:30.201 --> 17:34.165
We've got a Navy communication system, and right 
now there's a lot better commercial

17:34.718 --> 17:42.207
communication, television, satellite systems 
for command and control available other than the

17:34.718 --> 17:42.207
kind the Navy has. And I'm looking forward to maybe 
getting one of those because I think that if you're

17:43.149 --> 17:57.807
going to prove to yourself you can run something 
outside of the center of the bureaucracy where the

17:43.149 --> 17:57.807
heartbeat of the bureaucracy is, you've got to be 
sure you know what it's doing and can use it to

17:43.149 --> 17:57.807
justify your thousands of requests that come in 
from the bureaucracy all right well uh along that

17:58.664 --> 18:23.558
line would it have been possible for for you to 
think in terms of organization of a bureaucratic

17:58.664 --> 18:23.558
institution as bringing the various elements of 
oceanography together in one building if you had

17:58.664 --> 18:23.558
not been in one of the early disciplines or 
scientists which involve computer work that is

17:58.664 --> 18:23.558
nuclear physics

17:58.664 --> 18:23.558
i don't really understand that question well uh 
The first beginning of organizations in science,

18:24.297 --> 18:31.347
I would argue, comes from those nuclear 
physicists, particularly nuclear... Oh, the

18:24.297 --> 18:31.347
Manhattan Project. Oh, absolutely. But that was 
brought together for a different reason, and

18:32.789 --> 18:35.553
there were not computers then. The Navy was 
working on its first computer with Harvard called

18:35.613 --> 18:41.602
the Mark I Brain down at Dahlgren, Virginia, as I 
remember it, in the late 30s. The reason they

18:42.863 --> 18:46.769
brought the physicists together was just because 
it was an early discipline. They needed to get out

18:47.690 --> 18:53.438
in some remote location because they were 
fighting in a sense of what they might find when

18:47.690 --> 18:53.438
they developed it. They were going to develop it 
not as a scientific tool, but towards a specific

18:54.217 --> 18:58.142
end project. I mean, everybody knew exactly what 
they were going to try to do with it. So they put them

19:01.947 --> 19:08.717
together, and of course it only lasted during the 
war, and the scientific part of it almost fell

19:01.947 --> 19:08.717
apart within months after the war was over. At 
least I was over there at Los Alamos right after the

19:08.737 --> 19:11.841
war. That doesn't true. There were great brains, 
Teller, Oppenheimer, so forth. But basically the

19:14.885 --> 19:21.574
real desire to work together disintegrated at the 
end of World War II, as I read it. even though we were

19:22.111 --> 19:23.933
trying to work on the hydrogen bomb. But the real 
motivation to work together for, if you will,

19:23.953 --> 19:39.470
survival against the so-called Axis powers was 
what I think gave the, not the impetus for the

19:23.953 --> 19:39.470
consolidation, but the real reason that let them 
come together and put everything together. And of

19:39.490 --> 19:40.751
course, there were problems there. The problems 
there were mostly military, where if you had a PhD

19:40.791 --> 19:50.001
in nuclear physics, you were a buck private, and if 
you were driving the major, you were probably a top

19:40.791 --> 19:50.001
sergeant. That's another problem. Well, how do 
you explain, then, your developing interest in

19:51.912 --> 19:56.001
consolidation? When is it first apparent to you in 
63 that the parts of oceanography have got to be

19:56.101 --> 20:03.596
consolidated? Because none of them had enough 
capability on their own to ever either articulate

20:03.616 --> 20:11.052
the need for the importance to the oceans... the 
need for the oceans in their business, or worse

20:11.268 --> 20:17.858
than that, what it is they wanted to do when they got 
together. Because we were doing it through

20:17.958 --> 20:21.724
committee work, but it was getting bigger. And 
once it got big enough so that it became huge, you

20:21.924 --> 20:29.555
just can't sit down with a group of 12 people around 
a table. In 1963, I'll bet you by the end of the time

20:29.615 --> 20:34.643
Tex Treadwell had trained me, I'll bet you I knew 
90% of everybody working in oceanography, or knew

20:35.737 --> 20:43.027
of them, and I bet I knew almost that much of what 
they were doing. Today, I don't even know what the

20:43.047 --> 20:45.270
Navy's doing. It's gotten so diffuse that I can't 
really tell you what we're doing in great detail,

20:45.290 --> 20:52.520
even within the Navy, much less within the rest of 
the world. Now, you can say that's maybe

20:53.401 --> 20:58.588
bureaucracy, but I think as the group gets bigger, 
as the as the instruments become more

20:58.957 --> 21:05.105
complicated, more sophisticated, as the 
necessity for working together to solve the

20:58.957 --> 21:05.105
technical problems. For example, in 
oceanography, no longer, in my opinion, can a man

21:05.145 --> 21:14.718
take a thesis and take a ship and go to sea and make a 
significant thesis. Now, you'll get a thesis and

21:14.758 --> 21:26.955
get a Ph.D. that way, but as far as really beginning 
to solve the problems of what is the ocean like,

21:14.758 --> 21:26.955
you're now well beyond a single oceanographer 
dipping his wick in a single ship. I mean, we are at

21:27.712 --> 21:38.162
the point right now where, to do a job right, we tie a 
satellite or an aircraft or some other kind of

21:27.712 --> 21:38.162
worldwide sensor in with the ground truth of the 
ship. And if you start looking at it from that

21:39.463 --> 21:52.937
viewpoint and you look at it from a military 
viewpoint, the military man has long known that

21:39.463 --> 21:52.937
one person working independently doesn't 
accomplish very much except in espionage, but in

21:39.463 --> 21:52.937
operations he accomplishes very little. Perhaps 
it's the military mind or the experience when

21:57.563 --> 21:58.504
you're working together. But I don't really mean 
when I say consolidate to put everything under one

21:58.524 --> 22:03.489
individual. Consolidate to me is to consolidate 
one's effort, initiative, and raison

22:03.529 --> 22:12.639
d'etre, why we're here and what we're trying to do. 
I would not go beyond the consolidation I think we

22:13.540 --> 22:17.725
have now achieved in the academic world. I think 
that's about the optimum. What sort of opposition

22:20.788 --> 22:23.311
did you meet in the beginning? You mean from 63? 63.

22:28.090 --> 22:38.744
The opposition of the people who call themselves 
oceanographers but didn't really want to because

22:28.090 --> 22:38.744
they had been in another discipline or they were 
mapmakers or they didn't want to do this or didn't

22:28.090 --> 22:38.744
want to do that. In the Navy, everybody has his own 
organization, so therefore he doesn't want

22:39.765 --> 22:44.412
somebody else to serve him. If it were sexy or 
fascinating or necessary, he'd probably do it

22:45.793 --> 22:50.920
himself, but he wouldn't want to do it with 
somebody else. I think it's probably a

22:51.961 --> 22:57.709
relationship of Parkinson's first, second, 
third, and fourth laws combined together with the

22:51.961 --> 22:57.709
Peter Principle It says that humans, being what we 
are, will never really attempt to do the ultimate,

22:58.212 --> 23:06.705
but to do that which we see can be done most 
expeditiously. Now, and how did you handle

23:08.788 --> 23:12.574
problems in reorganization? Did you try to 
transfer people out? No. Try to reason with them?

23:15.719 --> 23:16.460
Try to reason with them. I never tried at that time 
to hit people over the head because I wasn't that

23:16.480 --> 23:24.152
type of individual, nor did I think we would gain 
very much. I think we only transferred one

23:24.689 --> 23:52.350
individual, and the reason for that was in trying 
to set up a new program for surface type of ships,

23:24.689 --> 23:52.350
that is, and that's part of oceanography in a 
sense, in trying to design new hull forms and break

23:24.689 --> 23:52.350
through the frontier that we found the individual 
most competent to do this was sitting up in an air

23:24.689 --> 23:52.350
development center, and he was too remotely 
associated with the people who went to sea and too

23:24.689 --> 23:52.350
intimately associated with the people who flew 
all the time so that To put him in charge of a new

23:52.702 --> 24:00.712
design of ships, he needed to have some kind of tie 
to the people who had some capability. I don't

24:00.732 --> 24:14.250
think you ever want to bind people to the past, but 
you certainly would like to link them so that they

24:00.732 --> 24:14.250
can come down that tradition and pick from the past 
what's important and yet reject the old if it isn't

24:00.732 --> 24:14.250
important. You can't be too tied, but you have to be 
somehow willing to get some support from the past.

24:21.929 --> 24:24.973
or by the past, I mean in this case, the capability. 
Many people argue that's not right, that you just

24:25.574 --> 24:30.421
go out in the wilderness, you carve out a hunk of 
desert, and you start from scratch. Well, they did

24:30.441 --> 24:38.733
that at Los Alamos, but that was a wartime 
situation, and everybody knew what they wanted to

24:30.441 --> 24:38.733
achieve, and the question was how to achieve it. I 
think in oceanography, we've only had glimpses of

24:38.753 --> 24:46.344
what it is we wanted, but we've never been totally 
able to articulate exactly what we wanted. And

24:46.845 --> 24:48.848
probably until that happens, we'll... have a 
difficult time. Look, can that happen in

24:51.332 --> 24:54.416
something as fast-changing as the Navy? It's 
happened before. It only happens once in the,

24:57.321 --> 25:00.285
probably in a generation. We went from sail to 
steam and it damn near killed everybody. We went

25:04.191 --> 25:06.554
into the submarine Navy and they tried to ignore 
it. We went into the battleship Navy and they tried

25:06.694 --> 25:19.273
to ignore that in Civil War and then we got so 
entrenched in the battleship Navy we couldn't get

25:06.694 --> 25:19.273
in the air Navy and now we're in the air Navy and so 
entrenched now we can't see the rest of the Navy and

25:06.694 --> 25:19.273
it's interesting. Well,

25:19.439 --> 25:41.008
you look

25:19.439 --> 25:41.008
at what you think the Navy will look like 20 X number 
of years in the future. you also ask yourself very

25:41.495 --> 25:44.178
broad scientific questions. You ask yourself, 
what are the fundamental requirements? Not what

25:46.440 --> 25:51.505
requirements are dictated by what you have or what 
you may have, but what are the fundamental

25:46.440 --> 25:51.505
requirements? And I guess it was very easy for me as 
an individual who had no knowledge whatsoever to

25:51.565 --> 25:57.731
be very fundamental. You know, my comment, the 
Navy must have the capability to operate at any

25:57.811 --> 26:08.502
time, at any depth, at any point in the world's 
ocean is a very simple statement, but that

25:57.811 --> 26:08.502
generates about $10 billion worth of 
requirements. That says you've got to build a

26:08.963 --> 26:11.265
submersible that goes down to 36,000 feet. That 
says you've got to have remote control vehicles

26:12.744 --> 26:16.108
that can do the same. And then from that, you say, 
well, now where can I get from there? And how

26:19.152 --> 26:20.093
important is it? And where do I put my priorities? 
And you suddenly recognize that very little of the

26:21.375 --> 26:25.600
ocean is deeper than 20,000 feet. So why pay 10 
times as much for a capability to get that 2%?

26:29.965 --> 26:32.568
Because the day we need it so badly, we'll go to 
20,000. So we'll design our systems around 20,000

26:32.788 --> 26:35.892
foot depth. So you can say, well, I didn't meet my 
major objective, but I met, say, 98% of it. It's

26:40.137 --> 26:41.218
always a give and take. The argument of whether you 
use, for example, you could say, well, I want all my

26:41.890 --> 26:47.130
equipment manned. I want all my equipment 
unmanned. You can use the space argument. I think

26:49.821 --> 26:52.812
we in oceanography and ocean engineering and 
undersea technology We've looked at it from three

26:53.230 --> 26:56.796
basic ways of doing business. You do it with a man in 
the vehicle, you do it remotely from a surface

26:56.816 --> 27:04.808
vessel, or you do it in some combination thereof. 
So you look at what combinations could you

27:05.088 --> 27:12.520
possibly do, and you get the surface ship that can 
put a pipe type of arrangement, stiff arrangement

27:05.088 --> 27:12.520
down on the bottom. You get the surface ship that 
can tow a flexible cable in the fish, and then you

27:12.560 --> 27:17.668
get the The vehicle itself, and the vehicle 
happens to be called a submersible, and they make

27:17.986 --> 27:22.853
many kinds of submersibles. And ideally, and I've 
been fighting for it for years and never won, I

27:22.953 --> 27:44.382
wanted a large submarine, non-combatant, that 
carried little baby submersibles that could

27:22.953 --> 27:44.382
operate below the surface air interface so that 
you could launch at any time of the day and you could

27:22.953 --> 27:44.382
do things in the complete oblivion of a relatively 
tranquil environment from a surface wave combo.
