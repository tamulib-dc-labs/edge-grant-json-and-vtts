WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:04.358
to know that I could do a day's work. And when I say a 
day's work, it would be from sun to sun. And I'd get a

00:11.950 --> 00:13.633
big dollar for it. Just one dollar? Just one 
dollar. And that bought your school clothes? And

00:17.840 --> 00:20.364
that helped to buy my school clothes. And I was so 
proud of you. Yeah. I was proud to know that I could

00:23.926 --> 00:27.455
be of help to my family. The question I must ask is, 
you've taught school for so long, and education

00:27.816 --> 00:41.108
has been at the center of your family and at the 
center of your life, because I saw you teach today.

00:41.088 --> 00:50.018
I know you've been retired for a long time, but you 
had those kids blooming, just blooming with

00:41.088 --> 00:50.018
discovery. In just one hour, they were 
discovering reading, they were discovering

00:50.538 --> 00:54.783
history. And, you know, I think about the kids in 
Harlem and Watts and just the kids in Las Cruces,

00:55.964 --> 01:06.015
New Mexico, and I just think that You know, to teach 
them the way you teach, to give them this value, I

01:07.565 --> 01:22.427
mean, if you could say something to every school 
child in this country, I bet you could say it and get

01:07.565 --> 01:22.427
it across and change their life. What do you think? 
Well, I know one thing. Uh-huh. You just stop, and

01:27.975 --> 01:37.048
it's an old saying, a spoonful of sugar... makes 
the medicine go down. A

01:39.527 --> 01:47.758
little boy that couldn't write his name today. And 
I said, Johnny, sure you can. Now you watch exactly

01:55.388 --> 01:58.292
what I do, Johnny. You watch my hand. Start right 
here. It takes time. It takes love and patience.

02:09.747 --> 02:10.948
And I just said, watch it. And he watched. And I went 
up real slow. Now lots of children's concept is

02:15.513 --> 02:20.178
quicker and they grasp it. But others are slow. So I 
took it very slow with Johnny. And I took two

02:26.685 --> 02:32.331
letters at a time until I had written Johnny. And 
then he came along and made his first two letters.

02:38.913 --> 02:41.997
And I said, oh, that is so good. But he just beamed. 
He just blossomed. I said, you did a good job,

02:46.642 --> 02:48.724
Johnny. That's good. And then he made eight with 
the two letters. And then he came back and made two

02:56.032 --> 02:58.175
more. And I showed you. I did it step by step. I think 
what is wrong... where it is true we're living in a

03:05.369 --> 03:10.135
fast age and times change.

03:13.238 --> 03:31.119
But patience

03:13.238 --> 03:31.119
and a desire to learn and a desire for a teacher to 
put it over and the love she has for that child can't

03:13.238 --> 03:31.119
be wiped out. They have to admit of all their 
educated philosophies that they stick at you,

03:35.018 --> 03:43.207
they can't wipe that out. You have to love. You have 
to love. You have to have the patience. You have to

03:48.693 --> 04:00.165
have that push and desire to open the door or the 
channel or the eyes of a child that can't see it.

04:01.462 --> 04:03.744
Yes, that's right. Indeed. And when I opened the 
door to this little boy. Today. Today. That is

04:09.970 --> 04:13.614
where I lit my candle today. The good book tells 
you, if you can light one candle, how much it means.

04:20.941 --> 04:22.703
Well, I lit my candle today. Then the little boy 
over here, that I asked him what reading was. Yeah.

04:30.487 --> 04:34.940
And he come down with the little girl that was in the 
fifth. She'll be in the fifth grade next year.

04:37.247 --> 04:38.531
She's in the fourth now. She couldn't tell me what 
reading was. She didn't know. Yet she'd sat here

04:42.907 --> 04:45.610
and heard all of this discussion. And he came down 
with his fist, and he says, it's talk written down

04:46.210 --> 04:54.379
on paper. That was great. And it just thrilled me to 
death. And he said, you don't read like that. I was

05:04.208 --> 05:10.855
trying to break the habit of saying, A, this is a 
tree. This is the ball. And I was trying to get it

05:14.706 --> 05:17.710
over. And that we had commas was just like a yellow 
light. It's a signal light to slow.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.166
That's good. And that was what I was trying. And 
who, what, when, where are all question words. And

05:39.437 --> 05:41.179
you ask it like one. You remember him picking that 
out? I do. And he said,

05:46.587 --> 05:51.613
can this one too? I said, yes, it sure is. So it 
opened the door. It's just like throwing out a

05:58.401 --> 06:06.189
fishing line with a good bait on it. You'll get a 
bite. If the bait is good. If the bait is not, it'll

06:10.827 --> 06:17.200
stay there and some will come along and nibble and 
off it'll go. But if that bait's good, it's gone.

06:20.126 --> 06:20.627
All right. I threw that line out and he grabbed it 
right quick with that reading. He understood.

06:32.847 --> 06:33.508
You did. It was great. I want to ask you a question. 
Since you grew up with that kind of value towards

06:35.793 --> 06:45.592
education and then, again, this was before you 
went to college to be a teacher that you believed in

06:35.793 --> 06:45.592
teaching like this. I can see that. Yes. Yes, I did. 
Because you learned and grew this way. And I just

06:49.560 --> 06:54.450
want to come right out and ask you, do you think this 
had an influence on your cousin? I know it was. We

06:55.582 --> 06:57.667
grew up the same thing. And Uncle Sam was one of the 
best teachers that ever walked in Blanco County.

07:03.199 --> 07:06.527
Now, there's so much of this stuff that I hear. Oh, 
his mother was an educator. They never say an

07:09.714 --> 07:12.019
educator. An educator.

07:15.895 --> 07:25.765
They forget that Sam Johnson was one of the 
smartest, quickest-minded men that ever walked.

07:25.785 --> 07:28.228
Now, Aunt Rebecca was good, I grant you. She was 
smart

07:29.169 --> 07:42.122
in her way, but not an overall educated person. 
Now, I'll take up for her anywhere. She was a

07:45.889 --> 07:47.171
wonderful woman. She had a great influence on me, 
and she had a great influence on Linda, and all the

07:47.952 --> 07:54.121
children she touched. But when it come down to the 
fundamental facts, none of them could touch Uncle

07:54.662 --> 08:01.011
Sam. Now, Kitty Clyde's mother was a teacher. We 
grew up with teachers. This community was

08:08.551 --> 08:11.435
teachers, teachers, teachers. It believes in 
education. To me, this is one of the greatest

08:12.596 --> 08:15.379
hearts of education. Right here in the country. 
All right. You just take this old school right up

08:19.083 --> 08:21.346
here. I can show you there's more people that's 
come out of the Johnson City School that have

08:22.327 --> 08:32.899
doctorate degrees than you'll find in any... 
Well, that's a Class B school, and we didn't have

08:32.879 --> 08:38.929
any affiliation until 1948. That's the truth. And 
we've got plenty of people that came out with

08:43.176 --> 08:49.487
doctorate degrees. Dr. Emmett Redford today, 
down there at the University of Texas. Or Dr. James

08:55.036 --> 08:59.443
Dollyhike, down at... No, at A&M. A&M, Dolly 
Height, yeah. Yeah, Dolly Height at A&M. All

09:04.449 --> 09:04.950
right. Neve Clark, Dr. Neve Clark down at A&M. Oh, I 
could... There's just a...

09:14.408 --> 09:16.231
Cox, what's his name? Sid. Sid Cox. Yeah. I'm going 
to tell you. He was quite a guy, yeah. Well, he was a

09:21.001 --> 09:22.964
folklorist. And I'll tell you, they lost the 
pattern when they made him. But they didn't, they

09:25.329 --> 09:29.577
didn't, he was smart. He had lots of brains, lots of 
brains.

09:35.097 --> 09:40.644
But these people came out of this small town that 
people pass through every day. That's right. And I

09:41.705 --> 09:49.875
think that the people of Johnson City, I think that 
part of that reaching out and that value and that

09:41.705 --> 09:49.875
touching each other has been education. I think so 
too. I think so because we wanted to show people

09:52.178 --> 10:04.733
that we were something and we would make something 
out of this life, that we could do it. I've

10:04.949 --> 10:19.746
got to ask you, when Lyndon began his education 
policies, you believe it was coming from this as

10:04.949 --> 10:19.746
well as from the political necessity of the 
country. I do know it. And he says that ignorance is

10:20.607 --> 10:25.993
our only enemy. And that is right. It really is our 
own enemy. And we... don't want to cultivate it, so

10:33.181 --> 10:36.307
let's kill it. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I would attribute 
that, again, this is part of the people. That's

10:44.642 --> 10:45.143
right. That was in him. And I won't tell you. I think 
people need to know that. And I think another

10:50.232 --> 10:53.337
thing, of course, they give them a bedtime. I know 
they do. But about... all of this program of

10:56.350 --> 11:03.217
feeding the children and Head Start and all of 
that. But let me tell you right now, that all stems

11:03.918 --> 11:08.763
from home. What would a kid do? He does well to get up 
and catch a bus and come in. What if he had to do like

11:15.090 --> 11:23.218
Linda and the rest of us, ride five miles to school 
and get here by 8.30 these cold mornings? And open

11:23.198 --> 11:25.822
eight gates. I want to tell you right now, you'd 
either learn your horse to jump them or you'd learn

11:26.342 --> 11:32.871
to ride up and get them open. Your hands are cold, 
your feet are cold, and you ride and you hook your

11:32.912 --> 11:46.911
bridle reins over the horn of the saddle and you put 
your hands in your pocket and make the old horse

11:32.912 --> 11:46.911
slow. Well, do you think that? And when we started, 
he had learned enough German, and we went to work

11:48.661 --> 12:02.138
down on the ranch and had those little Mexicans, 
and we got the German and the Spanish mixed up.

12:02.178 --> 12:03.539
Nobody could understand us. Speaking German, 
Spanish, neither. And Papa spent half the time

12:06.323 --> 12:11.329
going to school to get us straightened out. That's 
the truth for a while. And I think that lemon, all of

12:13.469 --> 12:17.315
this had an effect on lemon. Okay. So you believe in 
his heart that one of the attributes of the Johnson

12:17.895 --> 12:26.727
family, and I will give this as a whole, it's not 
singled out. It's no person's idea. But as a whole,

12:28.910 --> 12:32.555
you do believe that it was part of the family 
structure. I do believe it. I believe it with

12:33.917 --> 12:36.540
everything in my soul and body. We were brought up 
to be educated. Let me tell you, there were nine

12:41.448 --> 12:46.192
children in my Grandpa Johnson's family. Every 
one of those nine children could do something.

12:51.857 --> 12:54.660
They were educated to do something. Now, Aunt Mary 
was a great, great seamstress. In those days, to be

13:03.007 --> 13:05.489
a seamstress, that was something. That was. All 
right. And...

13:10.793 --> 13:15.158
Aunt Lucy taught piano. Aunt Frank was an artist. 
She did some of the most beautiful work that you

13:19.923 --> 13:24.528
ever looked at. Uncle George was a teacher. Aunt 
Jess was a teacher. Aunt Ava was a teacher. Aunt

13:32.277 --> 13:33.819
Kate was a teacher. My daddy did not teach school. 
But there's not anybody that won't tell you in this

13:39.768 --> 13:48.715
county that my daddy was one of the best judges of 
livestock of anybody that ever was. He was good,

13:52.798 --> 14:00.046
and he was one of the most wonderful ropers that 
ever... He served in political, or in cattle

14:00.066 --> 14:04.770
office. What was he now? He was cattle inspector, 
tick inspector for years. Right, yeah. All in

14:10.777 --> 14:12.358
South Texas and all through here. All through that 
region, yeah. And he also got the first

14:13.940 --> 14:26.497
right-of-ways for the Pertinolis Electric Co-op 
that was gotten to put up the lines because people

14:13.940 --> 14:26.497
were afraid of electricity. And my daddy went out 
and talked to them. They had faith in him. They knew

14:30.422 --> 14:32.985
that he was an honest, hard-working man. He was not 
a politician. He was a home man. And they had faith

14:36.810 --> 14:38.773
in him. And he got the right-of-ways for the 
first... Electric lights that came into Johnson

14:42.205 --> 14:45.078
City. A monument. And that was in what year? The 
first electricity. Back in 30... 35? 35. About 35.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.578
About 35.

14:58.359 --> 15:02.803
What was the first electric light in Johnson City 
to be lit up? It was a little bitty... Oh, TPNL came

15:02.823 --> 15:06.226
in here. TPNL. TPNL. Texas Power and Light with a 
little dynamo. Oh. And put it up over there. And

15:14.254 --> 15:17.236
every church had its own little light plant. Oh, I 
love that. the school had their own little light

15:19.178 --> 15:46.873
they'd heavy you could burn a 15 watt light bulb in 
your room but not anymore because it wouldn't

15:19.178 --> 15:46.873
carry it yeah texas parent life just couldn't 
carry it right amazing that's just oh i don't know

15:19.178 --> 15:46.873
it's over there where the old soul house stands an 
old hen building really yeah how about that it sure

15:19.178 --> 15:46.873
was

15:47.140 --> 15:49.143
Yeah, but I really believed. Then when you look 
back, and then on my mother's side, all of them,

15:49.263 --> 16:00.118
well, my uncle was, Uncle Jay was, worked in a tax 
collector's office. He's a deputy sheriff here

16:00.158 --> 16:06.026
for years and years, and worked in the- Well, 
that's Jay Johnson. Jay Chapman. Jay Chapman.

16:07.788 --> 16:08.028
Uh-huh. Aunt Mabel was a teacher. Uh-huh. My 
mother, so what could you expect? Teachers

16:13.175 --> 16:14.217
everywhere. Everywhere. Everywhere. Yeah, this 
community, yeah. And we just, we knew nothing but

16:17.615 --> 16:21.841
to study and to work. So that realization that 
ignorance is our worst enemy. That's right. Is

16:26.608 --> 16:32.036
true to heart, because when you were enlightened, 
I'm sure, by all of these teachers. Every time you

16:32.276 --> 16:42.051
turned around, if you used the wrong word, they 
called you down, if it wasn't for everyone. Yeah.

16:43.435 --> 16:44.736
Of course, they don't do that now. They say it 
embarrasses children. But again, this isn't the

16:46.118 --> 16:53.686
sophisticated professorial community where the 
old professor takes the book off the shelf. This

16:54.307 --> 17:00.734
was a whole unity group of people who simply valued 
knowledge. That's right. And do you know in the

17:01.434 --> 17:10.905
place of, we would get a little old current event 
paper every week. Yeah. But when we were young, I

17:11.498 --> 17:16.463
mean, we were in the seventh and eighth grade. 
Uncle Sam was, of course, in the House of

17:17.825 --> 17:25.934
Representatives and things, and he would come 
back and he'd throw out questions. We'd meet up

17:26.034 --> 17:28.517
there to play. Maybe we wanted to play bingo or not 
bingo, croquenole or hearts or something, some

17:29.037 --> 17:37.266
kind of game. Well, in place of getting to play, 
he'd give us... topics to discuss. And what do you

17:45.436 --> 17:50.320
think about ownership, government ownership of 
railroads? Do you think that they should own our

17:50.380 --> 17:56.746
railroads and tell us how much they're going to 
charge us for hauling? All right, you take the

17:57.206 --> 18:00.409
affirmative and you take the negative. He would 
use the power of debate, right? Right from the word

18:02.671 --> 18:04.292
go. And he'd set us over here in a room, all right? 
There'd be two of us over there and he'd come over

18:07.095 --> 18:09.137
here. Well, what do you think about the League of 
Nations? Yeah. What do you think that we should be

18:13.667 --> 18:15.710
doing? You take the affirmative and you take the 
negative. You go in that room. All right. What do

18:21.902 --> 18:26.190
you think about Eugene V. Debs, who's come out on 
the Socialist Party? What do you think the

18:26.230 --> 18:29.756
socialists have rights in this United States? 
What are they going to do? What's it good for?

18:35.047 --> 18:36.049
Question, all right? You take the affirmative. 
You take the negative and get going. You go up here

18:39.234 --> 18:40.836
and you pick out. I don't care. You can take out 
seniors and ask them things today in our

18:41.477 --> 18:47.387
government. They can't tell you. And say, now, you 
tell me what you think. I'll give you five minutes

18:52.796 --> 18:57.183
to get up here and get this written. Knowledge. 
Knowledge. Knowledge of everything that's

18:59.768 --> 19:05.536
happening in your world was of importance to you? 
It was at that time. We listened. Even the young?

19:10.763 --> 19:12.885
Little folks were seen and not heard. We listened 
to what was going on. We had to. And if you didn't

19:19.254 --> 19:22.418
know it, you was called a dumb bunny.

19:25.216 --> 19:27.926
So we just, that's the way we just lived. That's the 
only entertainment we had. That's all we had to do.

19:30.616 --> 19:31.118
Was learning. Was learning. Yeah. And he was poked 
down us three times a day. Sure. And in between

19:36.804 --> 19:38.026
meals. Right. It was really right. Yeah, I think 
so. It's not here today. No. You know, there's that

19:45.401 --> 19:47.745
big movement to go back to basics. But I'm 
wondering if anybody really knows what the

19:47.986 --> 19:51.753
definition of basics are anymore. I don't think 
so. I don't think so. That bothers me because...

19:56.519 --> 20:04.251
No, honey, when they tell you that 10 is as far as you 
need to count, you just as well forget it. Right. If

20:05.713 --> 20:13.785
you meet a certain quota of knowledge by a certain 
grade level, then you're okay, rather than to

20:05.713 --> 20:13.785
promote. the expertise in any area. There you are. 
It's a crying shame. It's worse than that. Oh, it

20:21.971 --> 20:22.892
is. But, I said before, we're following the 
footsteps of the Roman Empire. Just exactly like

20:28.501 --> 20:30.364
they did. We will fall flat on our face. All but 
there. We're all but fallen. We're all but fallen.

20:39.454 --> 20:40.395
We're all but there. Yes. It's really a shame.

20:46.901 --> 20:46.981
God. So what do you think people have to offer their 
children in the future? What are they going to

20:51.626 --> 20:54.148
offer them? What will they be to offer? The child 
gets everything that he has a desire for. Yeah.

21:03.537 --> 21:04.258
Without Any compensation at all? Of what he needs. 
Of what he needs. Yeah, that's it. I'm scared. I

21:12.502 --> 21:13.043
want. They wake up in the morning, I want. They go to 
bed at night, I want.

21:21.097 --> 21:28.390
I never will forget saying my prayer one night and 
asking God, It was getting close to Christmas

21:29.652 --> 21:35.497
time, and old times were hard, and I knew it. We were 
having a hard time on the ranch, and I said,

21:36.599 --> 21:49.711
I do hope that you make room for Santa Claus to come 
to our house, and he won't forget where we live.

21:51.272 --> 21:56.417
That we live so far back down on the river, and he 
could get lost. I can remember just saying that.

22:00.263 --> 22:08.815
But please, God, ask him to bring me just one little 
doll that's not homemade. Uh-huh. You wanted to

22:11.478 --> 22:12.900
have... I wanted a little doll that wasn't 
homemade. Uh-huh. Ten years old had never had a

22:18.748 --> 22:27.480
doll that wasn't

22:18.748 --> 22:27.480
homemade. Yeah. And tell me that... Uh-huh. We 
were not poor. We had everything. I had

22:33.150 --> 22:35.753
everything. I had all the love in the world. I was 
the richest one going.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.803
But earthly things were few and full. The 
material. The material. We're a material nation

22:47.805 --> 22:49.747
now. I mean, we really are. Everything that we do is 
based on what we own and how much more we can get. The

22:55.532 --> 22:59.076
material things were not there. And I will forget 
Uncle Clarence went to town, and he bought all the

22:59.613 --> 23:10.930
little girls a doll and put them on the Christmas 
tree. But to get this little doll, we each had to say

23:10.950 --> 23:14.154
a speech. And then, or we had to do a dance, or we had 
to sing a song.

23:23.328 --> 23:24.810
So again, you had to... Show your own. Own ability 
to do. And you didn't. And it wasn't hanging to you

23:29.253 --> 23:32.998
on a silver platter. You earned it.

23:37.223 --> 23:42.109
And what I'm trying to, the point I'm trying to 
make, what we did, we worked for. Now, whether we

23:43.871 --> 23:52.401
could say a good speech or whether we could sing a 
good song or whether we could do a good dance, we got

23:43.871 --> 23:52.401
up and tried. And we earned that ball for what we had 
done. Well, let me ask you another question

23:57.741 --> 24:00.986
because you're a woman. You're a woman in Texas. Do 
you feel that you were ever put down or put in your

24:03.750 --> 24:10.800
place as you were growing up in your home? Or that 
you were told that you had to be something and you

24:10.820 --> 24:15.407
couldn't be something else? Or how were you 
raised? I was told that a lady's place was number

24:23.060 --> 24:24.061
one. OK. B, quiet, polite, courteous.

24:37.375 --> 24:40.198
You're big enough to? You wanted to. You could do 
it. All I had to do was say, I can do it. And I did it. So

24:47.847 --> 24:52.071
as far as equal rights in your household, it was 
definitely there. Right. Always. Because

24:54.122 --> 24:56.324
there's always a job to do. I have always had all the 
power that I ever wanted, because I knew what I

24:56.344 --> 25:03.432
could do. And I darn sure wasn't going to overjump 
it, because the more responsibility I took, the

25:03.973 --> 25:10.861
more I was going to have to take. Yeah. And I went, as 
Ivy Dildine said, I went just so far Now, I didn't go

25:17.026 --> 25:19.248
any further. Yeah. And I tell you, I didn't. You 
know that. I know that, right. I'd come in from

25:23.132 --> 25:32.200
work, work all day like a trooper, and then work at 
the house. I'd do a day's work and a half a day after I

25:32.220 --> 25:39.127
got in from work. Uh-huh. And then go to the ranch 
and feed and check on the cattle and everything.

25:45.273 --> 25:45.413
Uh-huh. That's enough. I knew when I had enough. 
And I said, you can't do it. A question, because I

25:51.590 --> 25:56.675
myself grew up with the hard lot, you might say. But 
I ask that a woman's day-to-day, if she's a career

25:57.316 --> 26:07.627
woman, is a job from 8 to 5, let's say. Well, sure, 
and we come in and we open up a pizza or we go to get a

26:07.647 --> 26:16.357
frozen dinner and stick it in the thing. That's... 
That's the way of life. Do you think that women are

26:21.089 --> 26:27.095
being cheated today because of what's happened, 
that they don't see their ancestry? I do. More than

26:28.236 --> 26:30.258
anything in this world. And let me tell you one 
thing. They don't know their own strength. They

26:34.061 --> 26:36.944
don't know what they could do if they would try. 
Now, I work with girls up at the old ranch. Yes, for

26:44.331 --> 26:45.872
the National Park Service. That's right. They're 
on a Monday. I'll guarantee you at 80 years of age, I

26:48.387 --> 26:54.073
can work circles around every one of them. Right. 
And never know I've done it. Yes. I'm tired. I'm

27:00.800 --> 27:01.480
tired. Yeah. There are muscles in their body that 
haven't ever been stretched. That's right. Yeah.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.571
That's true. It is, I'm sure. And they don't. But 
people in other countries, and I have to ask this on

27:15.235 --> 27:20.904
a country and a basic culture question. People in 
foreign countries live with less luxury than we

27:21.645 --> 27:25.411
do. Yes, much less luxury than we do. Are they 
better off than we are, do you think? Physically,

27:33.624 --> 27:34.485
yes. Physically, yes. Of course, some of them die 
young. But it's their fault. And when I say it's

27:43.801 --> 28:00.784
their fault, they just fail to take the precaution 
and listen

27:43.801 --> 28:00.784
to what their body tells them. Well, I mean, your 
body's been through quite a bit itself, which I

28:01.338 --> 28:04.542
know. Certainly. I mean, you've lost several 
children in pregnancy because of the RH factor,

28:05.143 --> 28:13.234
which they didn't know about. Heavens knew 
nothing about it. Right, but here your own

28:15.477 --> 28:25.810
grandson, your great-grandchild, your 
daughter-in-law went out and had an injection,

28:15.477 --> 28:25.810
and now she can, you know, she went through her 
pregnancy fine, so... Yeah, but that I didn't

28:26.482 --> 28:28.965
know. They didn't have it, right. Back in the 40s. 
So you had the grief. Yes, I did. And it's something

28:34.231 --> 28:37.554
you don't overcome. If I had a girl today, well, 
things would be different. It still hurts. You

28:46.884 --> 28:48.126
wish you'd had a daughter. More than anything. I 
know, I can see it. But I have a son. that takes the

28:56.941 --> 29:01.611
place of everybody and everything. That he does. 
He is the best thing in this world to me. And I love

29:08.766 --> 29:10.329
him. And I know I love him too dear. Yes. Because I 
know that. But that's all I have. Is one child. I

29:21.092 --> 29:21.533
know. One child, no sisters, no brothers. I have 
nobody. I know.

29:32.565 --> 29:40.173
But I just hope God takes me before I have to give him 
up. I think God's taking care of both of you right

29:41.955 --> 29:45.038
now. On equal grounds. Well, I'm sure that's right 
because we're both on borrowed time and we both

29:48.046 --> 29:52.993
know it. But I don't even stop to think about it. 
Because when my work's done and I'm through, my

29:57.599 --> 30:05.529
time will be up and I'll know it. But right now, I've 
got plenty to do. That's true. I'm going to stop.
