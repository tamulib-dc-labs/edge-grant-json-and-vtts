WEBVTT

00:01.499 --> 00:21.249
We were talking about improvements in training 
and leadership at A&M and the Cadet Corps, which we

00:01.499 --> 00:21.249
think has been real good, and elimination of some 
of the bad things and improvement of the

00:01.499 --> 00:21.249
leadership in counseling mainly. And we think 
that the discipline training is much improved

00:22.912 --> 00:28.941
over what it was in 1945.

00:31.199 --> 00:35.083
And this should really encourage more students to 
become cadets. And the military services have

00:37.004 --> 00:41.508
improved the profession of militarism, too. 
There's no disgrace in being connected with the

00:43.670 --> 00:48.715
military anymore like it used to be. So this has an 
added impetus, but we still need to do some selling

00:50.336 --> 00:58.624
on this cadet program. The civilian program, all 
in all, we believed, while I worked here, was real

01:00.140 --> 01:14.172
good, except for the fact that they didn't have the 
organization that the cadet corps did. They were

01:15.153 --> 01:17.955
scattered because many of them have to live 
downtown. You don't have contacts with them. Many

01:22.239 --> 01:29.185
of them were married, and they don't have time to do 
student activities, participate in a lot of the

01:22.239 --> 01:29.185
programs. But all in all, those are the kind of 
people that have spent their time studying and

01:30.802 --> 01:44.499
doing their schoolwork, and we think have 
improved the scholastic proficiency of married

01:30.802 --> 01:44.499
students as a whole. And we kept records on this, 
incidentally, for a good number of years by

01:45.680 --> 01:49.945
categories. And we found that the married 
students were making better progress as students

01:49.965 --> 02:00.218
than the single students, which is good for the 
institution, too. And as a whole, these people

02:01.784 --> 02:06.271
were better satisfied than the single students.

02:08.874 --> 02:14.082
We tried from time to time to encourage them to 
participate in the program, and some of them did.

02:14.102 --> 02:20.532
But the thing that bothered us most was the fact 
that we couldn't ever get them all together. We

02:20.552 --> 02:24.578
couldn't get them into a cohesive unit. And even 
though we had programs set up for them, they didn't

02:26.180 --> 02:30.306
participate. like we thought they should. But we 
wanted it to be a voluntary thing. And if they

02:35.647 --> 02:43.319
didn't want to participate, for instance, in 
things like the intramural program, OK. If they

02:43.699 --> 02:54.055
didn't want to go out for athletics, if they didn't 
want to work on the MSC Council,

02:43.699 --> 02:54.055
fine. But all in all, we think they've made good 
progress. And despite the fact that some of them

03:00.948 --> 03:08.177
more scroungy clothing, and weren't quite as 
meticulous about the dress. We believed that this

03:08.678 --> 03:16.868
was a national trend, so we didn't fight it too 
hard. We weren't very happy about it from time to

03:16.968 --> 03:19.291
time. And I know Mr. Rudder wasn't. But there

03:22.095 --> 03:29.284
were certain limitations, too.

03:29.990 --> 03:54.748
tried to keep them as clean as we could and as 
meticulous and we did this with the hope that

03:29.990 --> 03:54.748
they'd have pride in themselves and in the 
institution we think it worked up to a point and and

03:29.990 --> 03:54.748
incidentally we think that this helped to keep 
down some of the disorders that other university

03:29.990 --> 03:54.748
campuses had

03:29.990 --> 03:54.748
and we didn't I spent a lot of time going around 
telling people that they couldn't have marches

03:55.403 --> 04:01.713
and sit-downs and things of this sort. They wanted 
to do it. Well, we discouraged it. We did what we

04:04.578 --> 04:06.881
could, and we always policed them. I don't like to 
use the word police, but we were there to see that

04:08.985 --> 04:14.093
trouble didn't erupt. And we had plans made for 
assistance if we need to call on outside police

04:14.594 --> 04:22.947
people to come in. And we kept close watch on groups 
that we thought might be subversive, like the SDS

04:24.817 --> 04:45.475
and other organizations that were very critical 
of various operations at the university, some of

04:24.817 --> 04:45.475
which were assisted by members of the staff. And we 
knew who these members of the staff were and

04:46.196 --> 04:52.782
kept institutional executives informed of this.

05:00.257 --> 05:11.476
We improved the police operation and we think that 
campus security operations on Texas A&M campus

05:00.257 --> 05:11.476
are as good as you'll find in most institutions and 
the men are now getting some training.

05:14.501 --> 05:19.630
This is required training and we've changed the 
attitude of the operation. I don't know whether

05:21.819 --> 05:25.765
you keep good men all the time or not, because this 
is a real problem. The time you get a good group

05:25.805 --> 05:30.431
trained, they get better jobs in other 
institutions. But they have a good program, and

05:32.154 --> 05:37.521
they've built a lot of good parking places for 
cars. Not enough, but as much as they have money

05:37.661 --> 05:47.655
for, and they've changed the system of 
registration, and they're spending a lot of time

05:37.661 --> 05:47.655
with regular police work. We have a remarkably low 
crime rate on Texas A&M campus. According to

05:54.321 --> 06:05.374
people in other agencies,

05:54.321 --> 06:05.374
we believe that it's much less than in most 
educational institutions even. But of course,

06:05.394 --> 06:13.464
when you have 10,000, 12,000 people, you're going 
to have some thieves and would-be murderers and so

06:05.394 --> 06:13.464
on. But we've had a good record so far. We've had 
little disturbance. And we think a lot of it has

06:23.310 --> 06:31.760
been due to the fact that we've had a lot of 
dedicated people on the campus, not only staff

06:23.310 --> 06:31.760
people, but a lot of students who have worked. For 
instance, I remember one time that we got a threat

06:33.001 --> 06:39.889
that the SDS was going to block. The cadet prayed 
when one of the outstanding generals came here.

06:44.675 --> 06:49.000
And they had special guards meet him at the airport 
and all this kind of thing. But a group of 200

06:49.874 --> 06:52.698
students came. And they had the names written 
down. And they said, we'd like to take over this

06:54.740 --> 06:59.586
responsibility of protecting this general and 
the parade. And we refused to let them have this

07:02.049 --> 07:12.182
because we didn't think it was fair to have a 
student group policing the campus for an

07:02.049 --> 07:12.182
emergency situation. So we managed to get some key 
students posted around to keep us informed. And we

07:19.608 --> 07:20.949
kept it from happening. And this was a small group 
of about 12 students that we knew were members of

07:22.191 --> 07:28.458
the SDS.

07:31.841 --> 07:41.231
Do you think one reason maybe we did remain fairly 
quiet during those days is that the students had

07:31.841 --> 07:41.231
come to a place where maybe somebody cared about 
what they did? I think that's right. I think most

07:43.474 --> 07:45.396
A&M students have come to A&M because they felt 
like it was a sort of a conservative type

07:46.658 --> 07:58.756
institution that didn't believe in uprisings and 
rebellions. There are ways of doing these things

07:59.297 --> 08:07.389
by proper process and students here have had the 
doors open enough for them to come in. We've

08:07.449 --> 08:11.856
always felt like it's There were a goodly number of 
the staff, teachers I'm talking about, faculty

08:13.608 --> 08:30.488
people who were interested in these programs too, 
and they assisted by even talking in classes from

08:13.608 --> 08:30.488
time to time, a few minutes about things that make 
an institution great. And I know our counselors

08:30.508 --> 08:37.977
have worked on this, and the tactical officers did 
in the cadet corps, and the military science

08:30.508 --> 08:37.977
people teach this kind of thing. They're a pretty 
good size staff too. But the administration has

08:42.582 --> 08:57.223
generally been opposed to

08:42.582 --> 08:57.223
mob action and violence and let the students know 
this. And the former students believe in this too.

09:01.509 --> 09:02.771
They believe in this attitude. Do you think maybe 
you have mob action and violence only when the

09:04.293 --> 09:12.285
students feel that they can no longer communicate 
with the administration, and here where you have

09:12.535 --> 09:18.926
an open door policy, where if you feel like you need 
to tell somebody off, you can go do it. You may be

09:19.026 --> 09:22.451
wrong in doing so, but the door is open to you. And I 
would think since the administration has been

09:23.473 --> 09:33.229
fairly open, and you can go see almost anyone on 
this campus you want to see, that this has probably

09:23.473 --> 09:33.229
averted a lot of problems. I think that's right, 
because I can remember many groups that I went to

09:38.050 --> 09:40.934
see Mr. Gilchrist when he was president. That's 
when we had a lot of unrest back right after the war.

09:45.641 --> 09:48.145
And they could always see him. They could always 
see the dean of students. They could always see the

09:50.248 --> 09:52.251
dean of agriculture. And if they wanted to have a 
group action, they got the executive committee

09:53.533 --> 10:01.324
together and let them point their own committee 
and come in and talk to the executive committee.

10:02.553 --> 10:10.523
And I know they had assemblies over in Assembly 
Hall and in Guyon Hall, where people, where they

10:02.553 --> 10:10.523
could express their opinions. And I think this has 
been continuous.

10:16.851 --> 10:25.101
I think, all in all, that this attitude, too, you 
asked a question that I think that communications

10:25.638 --> 10:26.699
help? Well, yes, it does. Now, of course, we felt 
like that some of these people in the SDS were

10:28.241 --> 10:33.689
planted here.

10:36.893 --> 10:46.786
I know from time to time we found problems that 
other universities had about the black people,

10:36.893 --> 10:46.786
for instance. And when Mr. Rutter decided to admit 
some black people, they did it very quietly and

10:51.659 --> 10:57.525
notified these people to come at a certain time. 
And they met in the registrar's office. And Mr.

11:01.770 --> 11:13.161
Rutter had the registrar and the dean and the 
student affairs people meet with them and explain

11:01.770 --> 11:13.161
to them what the university would and could do. But 
you people have to help. So they registered these

11:17.686 --> 11:21.430
colored people before anybody else arrested to 
avoid having them report to the line. So they were

11:30.387 --> 11:37.055
arrested, no newspaper publicity, no radio, no 
television pictures, anything. And these men got

11:37.095 --> 11:40.639
along real well with no trouble. And when they ran 
into some difficulty, they always reported to the

11:42.080 --> 11:50.269
dean of students' office and reported what they'd 
found. And then later we prevailed on the

11:51.987 --> 11:59.537
university to open up a swimming pool and the 
tennis courts and things like this for the black

11:51.987 --> 11:59.537
people. When was this? Do you remember?

12:05.165 --> 12:07.728
Must have been about 1959 or 60. I believe 60, but 
I'm not absolutely positive. But I remember we had

12:12.975 --> 12:15.919
one man from Florida. They were as happy as he could 
be because he said, this is the greatest thing

12:17.418 --> 12:26.808
that's happened for the black people, even though 
they didn't have very many of them. And so far as I

12:26.828 --> 12:31.013
know, we've never had any problem with the black 
people at Texas A&M. Now, we had one or two groups

12:31.934 --> 12:45.028
that wanted to demand, make certain demands on 
certain books and certain literature and certain

12:31.934 --> 12:45.028
classes, but Mr. Rutter and the library provided 
these things. And I don't know how many teachers

12:47.287 --> 12:55.736
they have, but they have some black people now 
standing on the campus that are teaching. Now,

12:57.838 --> 13:02.222
same thing happened with the foreign student 
program. Back when I came in in 1945, there were

13:02.282 --> 13:11.972
about 50 or maybe 75 foreign students, mostly from 
Latin American countries. And this thing was

13:11.992 --> 13:14.515
handled by two or three people. The registrar's 
office did some of the work, and the The dean of the

13:17.780 --> 13:25.871
college did some, and the rest of it was just done by 
the placement office, mainly advice. And

13:26.572 --> 13:41.573
so we found that these people weren't very well 
accepted in a lot of cases by our own students,

13:26.572 --> 13:41.573
mainly because of communications again. So 
President Bolton, when he was president, I don't

13:43.476 --> 13:47.702
even remember what year that was exactly, asked 
our, the Dean of Students Office, to assume

13:49.994 --> 13:59.963
responsibility for our advisement of all foreign 
students and take over the whole program. And the

14:01.865 --> 14:19.461
Student Affairs Office was bound with this thing 
and so we had to find out all the rules and

14:01.865 --> 14:19.461
regulations of the Immigration Service and the 
State Department and how to contact these people

14:01.865 --> 14:19.461
and we made associations with people in Houston 
and San Antonio and El Paso and Washington, where

14:20.251 --> 14:25.378
we could contact them and get these people. And we 
even set up programs where we'd have an

14:25.438 --> 14:33.007
orientation for these foreign groups when they'd 
come in. And in spite of the fact that we've had some

14:34.489 --> 14:49.448
dissidents, like when Castro was in first power, 
some of the people from Cuba wanted to go down there

14:34.489 --> 14:49.448
and take over. And we had to give them a lot of good 
advice, the best we had, of course, to keep them

14:50.558 --> 14:56.704
from getting into trouble. And they wanted to 
bring Castro here, and we forbid it.

15:06.594 --> 15:14.162
We had some foreign students that were opposed to 
the policies of the United States government and

15:06.594 --> 15:14.162
were very loud about this. And we had tried to keep 
them in tow for peacemaking purposes. And we had

15:21.659 --> 15:24.122
sessions with them. We organized a foreign 
student club, and we met with them. One of our staff

15:28.506 --> 15:38.938
always met with them and helped them arrange for 
some of their financial support

15:28.506 --> 15:38.938
and attended their special dinners and things of 
this sort. And we finally got Mr. Rudder to select

15:43.543 --> 15:50.991
Mr. Melcher as full-time foreign student 
advisor, because this grew and grew until he was

15:51.798 --> 16:21.535
full-time job and Melcher did this entirely for a 
good number of years until about five or six years

15:51.798 --> 16:21.535
ago when he took on some other responsibilities 
for the dean of students and I understand that Mr.

15:51.798 --> 16:21.535
Melcher is still the foreign student advisor but 
has an assistant and this has helped not only the

15:51.798 --> 16:21.535
foreign students themselves but it's helped A&M 
students become acquainted with these people and

15:51.798 --> 16:21.535
their heritage, heritages, and their customs, 
and getting a better attitude about worldwide

16:21.734 --> 16:31.408
situations. I think this has been good for the 
university up to a point. Now, there's some things

16:34.112 --> 16:36.295
that are wrong about it. We recognize those, too.

16:43.605 --> 16:50.475
We have noted, and this has been done by a lot of 
people, the university has tremendously

16:51.130 --> 17:00.322
improved its housing program and its feeding 
services and health services in the past 20 years.

17:01.564 --> 17:08.373
Because the university, up until about 1960, had 
an attitude that this was a poor man's school and

17:01.564 --> 17:08.373
should be kept that way. And they just didn't want 
to raise any fees. And they found out that it took

17:11.417 --> 17:17.425
more money and inflation was running prices up all 
the time. So the university finally decided that

17:19.092 --> 17:26.079
the only way to get better food was to get more money 
from the students. And the same thing about

17:27.320 --> 17:28.821
housing. Buildings cost more, and we tried to 
institute a program of maintenance and keep them

17:29.882 --> 17:43.335
painted and cleaned and put down new equipment, 
new furniture, carpeting and tile flooring and

17:29.882 --> 17:43.335
whatever we could. And we think this has had a a good 
effect on the students. A student can study and be

17:51.981 --> 18:04.077
happier in an attractive, clean place than he can 
in a makeshift proposition.

18:04.097 --> 18:09.144
And they've even put in telephones and lounges and 
spent a lot of money on this. Students don't

18:10.345 --> 18:15.272
sometimes use them as much as we think they ought 
to. I guess they still don't, I know they didn't

18:15.522 --> 18:35.984
when I worked up here, because some of the lounges, 
but we spent a lot of money on the Memorial Student

18:15.522 --> 18:35.984
Center and put in a lot of good programs there and 
A&M provided the facility for the best education a

18:15.522 --> 18:35.984
guy can get at reasonable price. I checked not too 
long ago for some people in Oklahoma who wanted to

18:36.004 --> 18:44.854
find out about Texas A&M and I found that the cost 
average cost per student detection and essential

18:45.020 --> 18:52.167
cost is about half what it is in most institutions. 
And a lot of institutions are as much as three and

18:53.369 --> 18:56.732
four times as much.

18:59.555 --> 19:06.142
So even though it's gone up considerably, it's 
still not prohibitive. And if a student wants to

19:06.162 --> 19:12.208
get work, he can get work to supplement his pay from 
home. The university has modified a lot of its

19:14.129 --> 19:32.171
attitude, and I don't know for sure what the 
attitude is about discipline at this time, but we

19:14.129 --> 19:32.171
believed in law and order all along through the 
years, and students knew this. If they didn't

19:34.333 --> 19:39.900
abide, they knew that they might get punished, and 
we tried to make it swift and fair and told them. We

19:43.170 --> 19:44.372
always told them why. I don't know whether this has 
always been the policy of the university, but

19:44.392 --> 19:51.282
while all the years I worked up here, we told them 
why we did this. We didn't just call them and say

19:51.302 --> 19:53.986
because we said so. We explained to them why we did 
this. Then they had an appeal. We got the

19:59.154 --> 20:01.878
administration to send them an appeal panel. As 
far as I know, it's still in operation. And this is

20:06.064 --> 20:09.870
good because if the dean or the commandant 
unfairly punishes a young man, he can appeal to the

20:11.335 --> 20:18.686
panel and he'll have nine or ten people listen. And 
it's very unlikely that they're going to all be

20:20.388 --> 20:26.718
unfair, at least the majority of them, we think 
would be fair. And, of course, he always, even

20:29.201 --> 20:33.187
after that, has an appeal to the president. And the 
president has overruled the appeal panel a few

20:33.207 --> 20:38.355
times, not often, but a few times.

20:41.558 --> 20:43.701
I don't know whether I've covered the thing or not. 
There's a good number of other things that I can

20:43.841 --> 20:48.167
see. When I first was a student, the health 
services were just sort of a first aid thing. When I

20:57.280 --> 21:07.373
came back here to work in 1945, they didn't have 
adequate staff or facility, and it was modified

20:57.280 --> 21:07.373
quite a bit. Now they have a new fine hospital. I 
guess, with complete staff. And I know the

21:12.885 --> 21:18.771
students can have inexpensive treatment. A 
student that doesn't ever go to the hospital pays a

21:20.733 --> 21:29.962
fee, but this is what sick insurance amounts do. I 
pay $230 a year for my wife and I. Last year, we got

21:33.205 --> 21:34.606
back $40. But if either one of us goes to hospital, 
we'd get it back. That's what it's for. It's a

21:40.884 --> 21:41.545
protection. And it's very reasonable. We did the 
same thing on publication. When I came to work at

21:45.410 --> 21:51.397
A&M, they were having some great difficulties 
with publication. They didn't really have a good

21:52.839 --> 21:54.622
organization. One man ran it, and he reported it to 
the president. I think the first man I knew was

21:59.028 --> 22:09.261
Roland Bing, and he was just out of the Army, was an 
A&M graduate, and had been a journal writer.

22:09.933 --> 22:14.240
journalistic, I think he studied journalism when 
he was a student, I'm not sure. But anyhow, he'd

22:14.260 --> 22:19.208
done some newspaper work and did public relations 
work in the Army. So he was hired as administrator

22:20.289 --> 22:25.217
of the student publication program. He did it all 
by himself. But when he left here, he started

22:28.422 --> 22:36.615
having trouble because students still elected 
the editors of all the publications. and

22:37.658 --> 23:04.408
sometimes this was a popularity contest not 
necessarily a matter of proficiency so the

22:37.658 --> 23:04.408
university appointed a board to advise them and 
sometimes the editors accused the board of being

22:37.658 --> 23:04.408
set up by the administration to censor which 
wasn't so because I served on that publication

23:05.013 --> 23:14.001
board about five or six years, and we were never, 
all the time I worked on it, told by the

23:05.013 --> 23:14.001
administration to do anything to censor the 
publication. Now, there are certain ground rules

23:14.061 --> 23:26.772
that were set down for us to operate under, and we 
didn't want the editor of The Bat, for instance, to

23:14.061 --> 23:26.772
just go out and tear the university to pieces. One 
or two editors took it on themselves to slaughter

23:28.614 --> 23:33.298
the cadet corps. And we didn't think they had a 
right to slaughter the cadets. So we, as a

23:38.781 --> 23:49.493
publication board, told them, as long as you fare 
and stick by the truth 100%, we can't tell you you

23:38.781 --> 23:49.493
can't do this. But what are you trying to 
accomplish? And they'd come around and see this.

23:54.518 --> 23:55.619
We did it by advisement. One or two of them we had to 
order not to do it, to leave out certain things. And

24:02.286 --> 24:04.028
they'd come down and jump the president We didn't 
think that it was quite cricket for the

24:06.505 --> 24:16.040
publications to tear the president to pieces 
because this paper goes all over the state. And

24:16.681 --> 24:27.398
so far as I know, the publications, two 
publications have been working better here than

24:16.681 --> 24:27.398
any other institution I know of. I know I read the 
paper about all the trouble they have over at

24:28.279 --> 24:32.766
Austin, and it's constant. Rice, not a very big 
institution, they have trouble. University of

24:37.021 --> 24:37.882
Houston. Harvard even had trouble with their 
lampoon and some other publications. A&M hadn't

24:42.948 --> 24:47.974
had that kind of trouble.

24:47.994 --> 25:00.829
Now, one other thing that I

24:47.994 --> 25:00.829
observed, A&M has spent a lot of time working with 
all state and federal agencies to get facilities

25:01.214 --> 25:14.754
for proper research, and we've gotten money and 
equipment from some of these firms and

25:01.214 --> 25:14.754
institutions, and I think ANM made real good 
progress with its program. Sometimes I hear

25:14.794 --> 25:29.196
various people in the faculty say we're spending 
too much on research, and I don't know whether it's

25:14.794 --> 25:29.196
true or not, but we need research, and it's 
expensive, But everything about the university

25:31.522 --> 25:40.971
expansion, and if I had any complaint to make now 
that I didn't make in 1945, is that the people have

25:31.522 --> 25:40.971
become more wasteful. The university people, 
when I came in in 45, were penurious, really. Had to

25:49.419 --> 25:52.421
be, because they didn't have the money. And they 
used pieces of paper, scrap paper, that normally

25:52.441 --> 25:58.407
you throw in the trash. And I see people now using 
letterhead stationery to write notes and pencil

25:59.635 --> 26:08.128
notes on and paper, I mean, telephone numbers and 
things. To me, this is a waste. And I see people

26:10.231 --> 26:19.566
making trips just for the trip purpose, not to 
benefit the university. Now, this didn't happen

26:19.586 --> 26:21.990
20 years ago. But this has been a change in all 
government agencies. People travel a whole lot.

26:29.926 --> 26:40.739
People become wasteful, and

26:29.926 --> 26:40.739
you have an assistant, and then an assistant to the 
assistant. You need some of these people, but a lot

26:40.759 --> 26:43.162
of them you don't need. And this has become big 
business, really. So I'm afraid sometimes that

26:46.786 --> 26:55.697
when an institution like A&M over expands, I don't 
know what the student enrollment was last year,

26:46.786 --> 26:55.697
17,000? It's been up as high as 18, I think. That's 
pretty big. That's a lot of people, and you just

26:58.825 --> 27:03.692
don't have the facilities to take care of them. At 
least you can't take care of them anymore. No,

27:07.959 --> 27:11.083
Cooper says it'll probably be 22,000 next year. 
That's right. Now, where are you going to put them?

27:14.148 --> 27:16.491
You don't have any supervision on them when they 
live downtown. They may be on marijuana or

27:17.453 --> 27:23.081
morphine or codeine or something. You don't know 
what they're doing. They may be prostituting,

27:24.787 --> 27:30.694
they may be stealing, they could be doing a lot of 
things. You can't say they're not doing that on the

27:30.754 --> 27:37.102
campus, because I saw all those things done when I 
was a student. Not very many of them, and a lot of

27:37.122 --> 27:44.010
them were picked up and talked to, and some of them 
were punished, some of them were sent home. But you

27:45.932 --> 27:47.334
don't even see them anymore. And the teacher has so 
many classes and so many students, a lot of times he

27:48.175 --> 27:52.600
just knows them by numbers. And I taught school a 
long time. I knew my students. I knew a lot about

27:57.721 --> 27:59.162
their families. This is good because I knew why he 
revolted when I wanted to make a B, when he wanted to

27:59.342 --> 28:09.733
make a D. I knew his background. Well, you can't do 
that in a big institution. And this makes it cost a

28:14.077 --> 28:16.439
lot. American

28:18.742 --> 28:23.987
people have become very fluid and wasteful we're 
wasting lots of good resources we're wasting

28:25.823 --> 28:52.320
lives we're wasting paper and trees concrete and 
other things so this is the thing we've got to keep

28:25.823 --> 28:52.320
in mind when we talk about students because they 
they they see these things happening back in the

28:25.823 --> 28:52.320
public school back in the city government back at 
home I just got back from San Antonio, and my

28:54.410 --> 28:59.657
grandson, 18-year-old high school kid, got one 
year in high school. He wants to go to A&M,

28:59.678 --> 29:01.240
incidentally. He wants to play football. He's a 
pretty good athlete, but he wants a car. So his

29:10.333 --> 29:18.244
father told him, Robert, if you can make enough 
money this summer to buy a car, fine, but I'm not

29:10.333 --> 29:18.244
going to make any note for you. Now, a lot of his 
friends had new cars. Papa bought it for Well, he

29:24.312 --> 29:27.496
doesn't need a car. It's good to have, but he 
doesn't really need it. He could ride the school

29:32.002 --> 29:38.491
bus from his front door, well, one block up to the 
school back, but he wants to go in his own car. This

29:40.454 --> 29:41.355
is expensive. Well, if you go staying in, he'll 
demand more than I demanded when I was a student,

29:41.595 --> 29:49.806
and more than his father did when he was a student 
here. So this is a trend in America.

29:54.451 --> 30:00.801
But I think all in all, I'm sorry I don't know 
anything much about Williams. I know him, I've

30:02.784 --> 30:04.727
seen him, met him twice. He wouldn't know me if he'd 
see me today. I knew Kodas by reputation only when

30:06.830 --> 30:15.163
he was at Arkansas and East Texas. He comes with 
good reputation, so he ought to be a good dean of

30:16.245 --> 30:21.032
students. give us any more about General Rudder as 
president? Any personal remembrances that you

30:25.475 --> 30:27.638
have? Yeah, I thought Mr. Rudder was an 
outstanding man. He certainly wasn't what you'd

30:31.322 --> 30:43.355
normally call an educator, because in the first 
place, he didn't have a whole lot of education

30:31.322 --> 30:43.355
himself, except what he made, his own 
self-education. But he understood how to find out

30:48.468 --> 30:51.452
about problems, and he went about it and found out. 
Sometimes he was pretty ruthless and

30:51.732 --> 30:57.019
cold-blooded about it, but he found out what the 
problems were at A&M. And then he set about trying

30:57.039 --> 31:04.127
to remedy the problems, check if he needed 
facilities. He knew where he'd go and get them. And

31:06.250 --> 31:09.054
he selected people like Dr. Settle, for instance. 
I know one of the reasons he brought Dr. Settle here

31:09.074 --> 31:14.821
is because he had good contact with the federal 
government. And Settle was a good research man,

31:14.841 --> 31:18.205
had this reputation. So he hired Suttle and turned 
him loose. And Suttle went after the state in

31:22.049 --> 31:24.732
Washington quite a bit. And not only in 
Washington, but everywhere. He tried to pick

31:29.596 --> 31:48.394
people that had some organizational ability and 
guts enough to do what they thought was right and

31:29.596 --> 31:48.394
would have a certain amount of allegiance to the 
university and to him. in my opinion, bad

31:48.796 --> 31:54.323
selections, but every leader's got to do some bad 
selections. I thought once or twice that he picked

31:56.125 --> 32:05.817
too many ex-military people just because they 
were military to be staff people. But most of them

32:06.638 --> 32:12.225
turned out to be real good people, real proficient 
and dedicated to A&M. Some of them are still here.

32:15.644 --> 32:21.895
And a lot of the non-military believers detested 
him for this, which wasn't fair. They were just

32:21.915 --> 32:26.062
biased and they were super critical. But he didn't 
matter with the education part of it. He let the

32:30.110 --> 32:33.055
deans do this because that's what they're hard to 
do anyhow. He went about raising money and

32:33.135 --> 32:40.588
organizing and setting up procedures and 
systems. And if he thought he could go to

32:41.767 --> 32:46.952
Washington and talk to somebody up there and get 
some help, he did it. If he wanted to go to Atlanta,

32:47.533 --> 32:58.424
Georgia and meet some people that were around him, 
he got a man set up there in the, what is that office

32:47.533 --> 32:58.424
where you go out and beg for money? The development 
office? The development office. He said, I have a

33:01.888 --> 33:03.870
good system there, and he helps them. When old 
Walker wants to go to see Sid Cowell, Sid Cowell got

33:11.281 --> 33:16.649
million dollars he wants to give to the 
university, and with a little drag on his feet,

33:11.281 --> 33:16.649
rather go see him. Just get in his plane or car and 
drive down and see him. He didn't hesitate to call

33:20.594 --> 33:27.965
Tiger Teague or somebody else in Washington, some 
general that he knew up there, or somebody in

33:20.594 --> 33:27.965
California. And I thought he was fair, fair to the 
student, fair to the staff. He got better pay for

33:37.679 --> 33:40.022
them. tried to improve the facilities. He didn't 
hesitate. He said, sure, it's a poor man's school,

33:44.586 --> 33:48.690
but we can't be paupers. We've got to build better 
places to live. And he set up a good system for

33:50.931 --> 33:53.814
building better buildings. And they had 
discarded the idea of air conditioning these old

33:53.914 --> 34:00.319
buildings. And Rutter said, I'm not going to take 
that. And he pointed to Dean Benson and said, Dean,

34:03.162 --> 34:07.886
I want you to get with some experts. Bible, Hollis 
Bible, for instance. Bring him up here and make a

34:11.423 --> 34:13.426
survey. And then if you all tell me that it can't be 
done, I'll buy it. But in two years' time, he had all

34:17.592 --> 34:20.416
the old bellies air conditioned. Because he just 
didn't take no. Now, I didn't think he could do it

34:22.939 --> 34:25.583
either. But it worked out real good. He got a lot of 
prestige for A&M because he'd go and speak for A&M

34:28.527 --> 34:40.063
wherever he went.

34:40.516 --> 34:49.347
I think people generally here and away from the 
university had a great deal of respect for Earl

34:40.516 --> 34:49.347
Rudder. And I think it would be a long time before 
they got a man to replace him. He didn't have a

34:57.016 --> 35:03.284
doctor's degree and all that, but he was a smart 
cookie. He knew people pretty well, and he knew how

35:03.865 --> 35:09.612
to get things done, and he worked hard. In fact, I 
wouldn't be surprised if he did. He worked too hard

35:13.779 --> 35:17.284
and didn't take care of his health like he should 
have. And died at a reasonably young age. And I

35:25.556 --> 35:37.334
think if he'd have stayed here another 10 years 
until his retirement time, it wouldn't have been

35:25.556 --> 35:37.334
quite 10 years, but I think he would have done 
terrific things for A&M. Maybe somebody else can,

35:39.317 --> 35:40.999
too. Nobody's indispensable, but I thought he was 
real, real excellent for Texas A&M. Now, at the

35:48.743 --> 35:51.467
University of Texas, he probably wouldn't have 
been worth anything. But he was an ex-Aggie, and

35:52.548 --> 35:54.830
this helped him. And he had the respect of the 
military people in the United States because he'd

35:56.853 --> 36:03.520
been a general. Was a colonel in combat, a 
lieutenant colonel in combat.

36:10.443 --> 36:19.793
And they proved that he could organize from 
scratch to confounded, compounded, fighting in

36:10.443 --> 36:19.793
it. He did it. This helped him. And then he took that 
land office when he was in trouble, bailed it out.

36:28.843 --> 36:32.307
And this balance had been difficult. I have a 
question. I just wondered, do you believe he ever

36:32.948 --> 36:36.151
had any political aspirations? I've heard it 
rumored that he might have liked to run for office.

36:40.700 --> 36:50.072
Yes, in fact, I heard quite often when he first came 
here that he came here with the hope that he would

36:40.700 --> 36:50.072
eventually jump to be governor of Texas. I heard 
this. And then I also heard once or twice that he had

36:51.453 --> 36:57.561
some aspirations about being a federal 
politician. Possibly running for the Senate?

36:59.664 --> 36:59.944
Yes. But I sort of doubt this because I've talked to 
him many times. In fact, I asked him about it. Point

37:09.016 --> 37:12.520
blank, did you have any political aspirations? 
Now, some people here still believe that he did. In

37:17.625 --> 37:24.533
fact, I talked to a man yesterday that said he 
believed that Ernie Rudder came here with that in

37:17.625 --> 37:24.533
mind. And he had this from some people in Austin. I 
said, well, they were just guessing, I'll bet you.

37:30.800 --> 37:31.881
Now, maybe he did. I don't know. But if he did, he 
should have dragged his feet a long time. Yeah, it

37:35.594 --> 37:36.515
is interesting. I just wonder whether that was a 
rumor or maybe he ever, he really did want to run for

37:36.656 --> 37:41.783
office. I know he did a very good job when he was in 
the land office. Yes. And built a fairly healthy

37:46.049 --> 37:49.114
respect. Well, he was elected one time, wasn't he? 
Yes, he was. He was appointed to take a vacation,

37:52.619 --> 37:55.383
then he was elected. Well, he might have been, I 
don't know, but he told me that he didn't have any

37:56.785 --> 38:04.015
ambition to be governor of Texas or a senator. No, 
you can't tell. I don't know. Now, he was mayor of

38:08.325 --> 38:11.368
Brady, wasn't he? Gee, I think so. I think so. Which 
nothing really politically. No, no, no. It's not.

38:18.878 --> 38:19.339
I know that. It's just interesting. I'm wondering 
whether his career was cut short here or was cut

38:21.041 --> 38:25.006
short for a bigger. He had bigger things in mind. I 
really believe the reason... I got awful upset at

38:33.475 --> 38:48.477
Mr. Rutter back at the time Com left here, because 
as I told you yesterday, Mr. Rutter had been to A&M

38:33.475 --> 38:48.477
when they didn't have any student services. 
Everything was done by the Commandant's Office.

38:53.103 --> 39:00.434
And then further, he was an athlete, and athletes 
didn't do a lot of things that regular cadets did.

39:00.454 --> 39:02.757
They lived a sort of secluded life, They always 
did, even back when I was in school. So when he came

39:08.288 --> 39:17.199
here, he come left, and Mr. Rutter told me that he 
believed he didn't see any sense in that

39:08.288 --> 39:17.199
organization. He said, go wipe it out. And I said, 
sir, you wipe it out, and you're going to see how

39:18.240 --> 39:22.385
fast A&M folds up. Because the commandant has 
positive orders from the military that he cannot

39:23.106 --> 39:30.735
keep A&M's dirty linen clean. Now, I don't like to 
use dirty linen because everything that you do in a

39:32.352 --> 39:40.559
student life, people associate with violence and 
crime. But I'd say 90% of the things that student

39:41.560 --> 39:50.188
personnel service people do don't have anything 
to do with rules and regulations and violations.

39:51.168 --> 39:53.150
So he said, well, what do you do? And I told him. I 
wrote out a whole page of things and outlined for

39:53.891 --> 39:59.176
him what to do. He said, draw me a diagram of what 
ought to be. And just behind he, so he finally asked

40:03.655 --> 40:10.147
me, if we make you dean, what'd you do? And I said, 
no, I don't want to be the dean. And he asked me why.

40:14.855 --> 40:21.567
He smiled and said, well, that to me sounds silly, 
but I'll buy that. So two days later, he called back

40:23.911 --> 40:27.638
and said, I'll change my mind. I've talked to some 
other people, and I think we're going to keep some

40:28.883 --> 40:37.012
semblance, and I'd like to have you stay on as the 
director of student personnel services. Not a

40:37.733 --> 40:41.417
dean, but a director. And the reason was I had told 
him that if I take it on and do it like I thought it

40:41.438 --> 40:57.456
ought to be, there are about seven or eight people 
that I'd have to fire for inefficiency, but they

40:41.438 --> 40:57.456
were all good friends of mine, and I wasn't going to 
fire them because I didn't hire them. So he got mad

40:59.090 --> 41:03.236
at me, said, he said, trouble is you don't have gut 
enough to do it. I said, hell, I don't. I got gut

41:04.838 --> 41:06.039
enough to do it. I'm just not going to do it. I don't 
believe in operating like that. So I got real mad at

41:10.385 --> 41:11.547
him. And I went back to see him later, and he laughed 
and said, you got mad, didn't you? And I said, yeah,

41:19.137 --> 41:20.338
I got mad, sure.

41:24.263 --> 41:25.485
I didn't like your attitude. So he said, I didn't 
like yours either. But anyhow, we got it all

41:28.723 --> 41:30.125
settled. And he told me just a short while, four 
hours ahead. In fact, I had a heart attack. And he

41:35.610 --> 41:37.212
came down to the hospital to see me. And he came over 
and put his hand on my shoulder and said, don't

41:40.135 --> 41:44.640
worry about your job. We'll take care of it if I have 
to do it myself until you get back. And when I got

41:51.627 --> 41:53.869
ready to retire, he came over. and talked to me a 
long time about the Student Life Program. And he

41:59.387 --> 42:05.815
said he'd changed his mind about a lot of things at 
A&M since he'd been working here. And one of the

42:05.835 --> 42:23.738
things was that he knew that we needed to have good 
planning and good leadership in the Student Life

42:05.835 --> 42:23.738
Program at Texas A&M, just as much so as we did in the 
dean's office in veterinary college and

42:05.835 --> 42:23.738
architecture and so on. And he saw a lot of things 
that needed to be done, and he said, I'm going to

42:26.266 --> 42:31.752
keep on. I'm going to do it. I don't know when, but 
we're going to do it. And he changed up some of the

42:37.399 --> 42:45.508
things in the commandant's office that added some 
strength to the cadet corps. I'm

42:45.528 --> 42:50.634
forgetting what year. But anyhow, when he made the 
commandant not a civilian, But an army officer,

42:56.624 --> 43:00.408
what year was that? You know, 1959,

43:00.428 --> 43:07.335
I guess. Yeah, 1959.

43:12.781 --> 43:22.851
And he just removed the comrade who was a reserve 
officer on duty

43:12.781 --> 43:22.851
and moved him and his staff out.

43:26.172 --> 43:32.862
Colonel Baker came here and he said, you are the 
commandant.

43:32.882 --> 43:48.025
And you'll handle the, you'll handle everything 
except the discipline, but we're not going to take

43:32.882 --> 43:48.025
all that discipline away from the commandant, but 
we're not going to expect you to suspend kids for

43:32.882 --> 43:48.025
beating others, for getting drunk and stealing 
and things of this sort. But if you find, if you find

43:49.407 --> 43:52.011
ordinary people mist him in like dirty shoes and 
filthy room and tearing up the dining hall, you can

43:52.430 --> 44:02.986
give them punishment, military punishment. But 
if you have to punish him for crime, then this will

44:03.006 --> 44:07.513
be done by the dean. So Dean Hannigan understood 
that when he was here. When he first came, he

44:11.098 --> 44:14.343
understood that's going to be part of his 
responsibility. And he never did buckle from it.

44:16.947 --> 44:20.833
And

44:16.947 --> 44:20.833
so this made This made a better cadet corps, but the 
only thing that was bad about it, they took all the

44:21.421 --> 44:29.672
attack officers out. They didn't do it all at one 
time, but they piecemeal and so forth. I know they

44:33.297 --> 44:36.481
don't even have a tactical officer down there now. 
I think they need some. They got one man, I believe,

44:38.203 --> 44:42.048
and I can't even think of his name. I've talked to 
him once or twice. He's a young man, and he's doing

44:43.670 --> 44:50.179
advisement, but one man's not enough to advise... 
three thousand cadets.

44:55.728 --> 45:02.939
Now he may, the colonel over there may have it 
broken down and some of his officers doing some of

44:55.728 --> 45:02.939
this advisement too. If they want to do this they 
could do it. And this, I think this is real good

45:07.467 --> 45:09.890
actually. I saw this done at some military units I 
was in Once or twice I was castigated because they

45:14.898 --> 45:20.727
said, we want you to teach them to fight and that's 
all. I said, no, it's more than that. I want them to

45:22.970 --> 45:24.312
be good citizens. And they've got to have some 
confidence in me as a commander if I'm going to tell

45:26.075 --> 45:32.685
them to go get them. When I send them out there to get 
shot at, I want them to have guts enough and

45:32.725 --> 45:41.057
confidence enough in me to know that I'm going to do 
what I can to help them. And the only way I'm going to

45:42.117 --> 45:50.867
do this is to talk to them about God and a few things 
that are important. I didn't hesitate to talk

45:50.887 --> 45:52.389
about it. I didn't infuse profanity with them, 
things like that. So I don't believe that you have

45:57.154 --> 46:02.701
to do it at Texas A&M either.

46:02.721 --> 46:05.243
Can you think of anything else you'd like to 
comment on? Covered a lot of ground. No, I think A&M

46:07.306 --> 46:11.010
made lots of progress.

46:13.690 --> 46:23.241
I saw a lot of things wrong with it while I worked 
here, and I know you can't perfect everything. No.

46:24.443 --> 46:31.631
You've got certain weaknesses in certain 
positions of people, and all your students are not

46:24.443 --> 46:31.631
ambitious all the time. A lot of them are not 
ambitious at all, and this handicaps you.
