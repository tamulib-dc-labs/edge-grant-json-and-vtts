WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:09.059
Graduated from A&M in 1935 and went to teach in San 
Gabriel. In two years' time, I left to go to Alfie,

00:09.600 --> 00:20.515
but I had one of the most remarkable experiences 
that I ever had in San Gabriel. The secretary of the

00:22.277 --> 00:30.308
school board and I were absolutely like twin 
sisters. And he had a history that I'd like to write

00:32.127 --> 00:41.158
his biography, but I can't get my own written. But 
Jamie Clark was the secretary of the school board,

00:42.159 --> 00:56.617
and he approached the people by saying, WPA is 
building schoolhouses, and we can get a grant to

00:42.159 --> 00:56.617
build a schoolhouse. So he asked the people, to 
vote a $5,000 bond to build a schoolhouse. Had the

01:03.668 --> 01:21.279
architects draw up an eight-classroom 
gymnasium-type schoolhouse, 256 feet long and 50

01:03.668 --> 01:21.279
feet wide and with a gymnasium on the back. And 
after it got started, He barely got the foundation

01:23.900 --> 01:25.922
laid. He didn't quite get it all finished before he 
had to have another bond issue. And by the time he

01:32.168 --> 01:42.718
got the second bond issue, while we got the walls up 
top of the level of the ground, and we had to have

01:32.168 --> 01:42.718
another. And I said, Jamie, you knew that you 
couldn't build a schoolhouse for what you have

01:42.738 --> 01:50.886
gotten so far. He said, well, yes, I know. But he 
said, my son asked me for a nickel one morning. And

01:56.602 --> 02:00.266
then he asked me a nickel after breakfast. And he 
asked me for a nickel. He said, at the end of the day,

02:02.529 --> 02:07.235
he said, Daddy, here's this $0.25 I asked you for. 
And so he got enough money to build a schoolhouse.

02:12.401 --> 02:19.290
And I was put in charge of the laying of the rock on 
that schoolhouse. And I spent more time. somebody

02:22.912 --> 02:30.581
else took my responsibility so that I just had 
vocational agriculture and schoolhouse. And

02:30.601 --> 02:49.763
when we had gotten that wall that was ten feet 
underground and eighteen feet above the ground

02:30.601 --> 02:49.763
and two pieces of girders that were sixty-six 
inches, sixty-six feet, two inches tall ready to

02:30.601 --> 02:49.763
be joined by bolts in the center of the arch. And 
when those were raised, there wasn't a plow in the

02:56.042 --> 03:07.813
field in San Gabriel when I told them when we'd 
raise the

02:56.042 --> 03:07.813
girders for the gymnasium. And I want you to know 
that whenever that first girder went up there and

03:09.134 --> 03:20.425
went down into those bolts that were 18 inches in 
that stone wall, And then lift let it down on the

03:21.620 --> 03:25.665
other side and it went down. And it did so because I 
had enlarged the 8. 5H hole. The two 5H holes

03:36.017 --> 03:40.762
together so that I had 10 inches on each end. And 
when we raised those four girders in less than two

03:42.084 --> 03:47.290
hours. I could have walked off of that top of that 
house without touching a thing but air until I got

03:48.012 --> 03:54.359
to the ground. There was a 20-year-old individual 
in charge of a project that was employing 75,000,

03:55.300 --> 04:06.052
75 people. I was really a happy young man, I 
guarantee. Now, go ahead. Describe what it was

04:15.423 --> 04:17.445
like to... What were your classes, and describe 
the students then.

04:25.947 --> 04:31.114
The students that we had at the high school were 
farm people. There were three different ethnic

04:32.616 --> 04:35.820
groups in the community. There were Czechs, there 
were Germans, and then there were white folks. And

04:43.009 --> 04:44.952
they were so designated. And Jamie and I were the 
only people that could get along with all three

04:45.505 --> 04:49.909
ethnic groups. And I wanted to take a German boy to 
the state contest in debate one time. And I went to

04:58.718 --> 05:02.641
see the daddy of the boy and asked him if he could go 
with us. And he said, well, yes, I reckon he can go.

05:07.866 --> 05:12.711
But said, all you're doing is teaching him to run 
around, and I've got to teach him to work. That's

05:14.075 --> 05:17.239
his attitude.

05:18.380 --> 05:27.851
One man, when I took him home, he lived up on the 
hill, and it wasn't gravel. And I took the boy home

05:28.331 --> 05:31.335
at night, 10 o'clock. And the boy got into his 
parents' yard, and his dad heard something out

05:32.075 --> 05:43.288
there, and he got his shotgun and shot his son full 
of bullets. Buckshot? Buckshot. And I want you to

05:47.344 --> 05:55.053
know that they took him to Temple and he wasn't 
fatally injured and so forth. But I was afraid of

05:55.514 --> 05:58.117
that man ever since then. You were responsible for 
teaching what courses? Well, I taught a seventh

06:02.963 --> 06:07.248
class one semester. And then at one time I taught a 
fifth grade class for one semester. And the rest of

06:14.048 --> 06:18.735
the time I was teaching vocational agriculture 
and working on the building. And the people in the

06:20.297 --> 06:34.919
ag education department told me that I either had 
to quit building the schoolhouse or, and I got a job

06:20.297 --> 06:34.919
at Alvin. During those years at San Gabriel and 
then in Alvin, What clearly were the rules of

06:41.268 --> 06:47.596
behavior and conduct for a young teacher? They may 
not have been written down, but what did you know?

06:51.381 --> 07:01.574
They clearly were that you had no contact of any 
kind with the students.

07:02.035 --> 07:08.203
I had a girl that was a sophomore, and she brought 
roses to me every day. And when I went back to one of

07:09.314 --> 07:17.403
the reunions 40 years later, one of the girls said, 
well, every girl in the class had a crush on you. But

07:18.184 --> 07:23.010
remember, I still looked like I was 19 years old. 
And I wasn't much older than that, but I knew

07:23.030 --> 07:25.613
better. What about things like movies and smoking 
and dancing?

07:34.122 --> 07:35.524
We were so far apart. a way that we didn't have those 
things. We were strictly a rural community. And I

07:43.244 --> 07:48.952
had a rule that the boys could not smoke in the back 
seat of my car. And if they had to smoke, they'd have

07:50.314 --> 07:55.040
to ride in the front seat with me. Was it all right 
for you to smoke as a teacher? Yeah, it did. It was at

07:58.725 --> 07:59.847
that time. I turned down one job when I was out on the 
interview because of school. They asked me if I'd

08:05.930 --> 08:08.893
quit smoking if I got the job. And I said, no. I said, 
every one of you got a cigarette tray in front of

08:11.456 --> 08:20.305
you, and you asked me to say if I'd quit smoking, I 
will have your job. And that was Riesel, Texas.

08:22.507 --> 08:24.169
Could you go to a pool hall? No. Were you expected to 
be a churchgoer? I

08:28.773 --> 08:35.160
didn't really feel like. that there was any 
compunction, but I was. But you didn't think that

08:41.064 --> 08:43.426
that was a requirement? That's right. And you went 
then to Alvin. Describe those years. Well, the

08:50.393 --> 08:59.382
first two years I was unmarried, and I got involved 
with Future Farmers there.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.468
Finally, we We had two projects that we were 
interested in. One of them was a Jersey cattle

09:11.936 --> 09:19.224
business, and we bought Jersey cattle from R.E. 
Hildebrandt in San Antonio, Jersey cash for our

09:19.264 --> 09:27.352
club, and he gave us a Jersey bull. And then we 
bought pigs from former Governor Ross Sterling.

09:36.194 --> 09:47.127
And at that time, the governor was using his help to 
have a sausage route. And I was told that he made his

09:47.147 --> 09:53.955
living peddling whole hog sausage in Houston. 
That Jesse Jones had caused his financial empire

10:01.793 --> 10:10.484
to collapse because Jesse Jones told him to do 
something in Texas from Washington, and he said,

10:01.793 --> 10:10.484
I'm governor of Texas. But he was a real 
interesting individual. My boys were delighted

10:14.148 --> 10:19.575
to know that they'd been at the home of the 
ex-governor of Texas.

10:22.839 --> 10:29.067
I took a group of boys one time to the Fort Worth Fat 
Stock Show with their livestock. And when we were

10:30.228 --> 10:43.969
there, I had told them specifically that not one of 
them could get drunk when they were out with me, and

10:30.228 --> 10:43.969
some of them did. And when I got back to Alvin and 
reported to the superintendent what had

10:44.911 --> 10:57.771
happened, he didn't uphold me in the decision that 
I had made, that I had explicitly told him. was a

10:58.645 --> 11:02.856
part of their trip. And so that's when I decided to 
get out of school teaching. And I spent

11:10.627 --> 11:13.170
from June 1st to October 1st on R.E. Hildebrandt's 
dairy farm. Now, this is what year? 1939. 1941.

11:19.678 --> 11:30.411
Now, then

11:19.678 --> 11:30.411
that fall, what did you do? I was in the Army. I went 
into the Army on October

11:32.053 --> 11:39.081
13th, 1941. Where were you when you heard the news

11:39.787 --> 11:47.814
of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor? I was in 
church with a friend of ours from Columbus,

11:49.775 --> 12:09.372
Georgia, who had

11:49.775 --> 12:09.372
relatives in Montgomery, Alabama, and they 
didn't have any transportation, so I took them to

11:49.775 --> 12:09.372
visit their relatives And we went to church in 
Montgomery, Alabama, about 80 miles from

12:09.790 --> 12:16.055
Columbus. And when I heard about the attack after 
our noon meal, I took off immediately to go back to

12:16.075 --> 12:33.270
the barracks in Fort Benning.

12:33.290 --> 12:39.595
And what did you and your fellow officers and 
enlisted men think was going to happen? Well, now,

12:39.963 --> 12:42.686
then I was living in an officer's barrack. We had no 
contact with enlisted men until... What did you

12:43.628 --> 12:49.835
and your fellow officers do? We went around and 
holding up our orders, and it said, unless sooner

12:49.855 --> 12:59.988
relieved, you will go back to your civilian 
occupation. And then everybody looked at

13:01.310 --> 13:05.415
everybody else and said, you know what that means? 
And that means we'll be in here a long time. I had a

13:10.574 --> 13:13.799
fantastic career at the infantry school. I went 
over there as a first lieutenant. Since I had been a

13:18.125 --> 13:23.654
teacher, they kept me to be an instructor at Fort 
Benning. And within five months after I started my

13:25.176 --> 13:30.845
instruction, I was promoted to captain. And nine 
months later, I was promoted to major. When I left

13:37.861 --> 13:44.448
there, that was the last promotion I had till I was 
discharged as Lieutenant Colonel. And how long

13:44.468 --> 13:47.370
were you at the infantry school? Two years. I went 
in and took one course. And then when I was relieved

13:51.915 --> 14:00.624
of my responsibility, I spent a period of time 
there till I got my majority. And then I went to the

14:01.344 --> 14:07.210
field grade officer's class and spent two nearly a 
year of my time there. All right. After that, where

14:11.570 --> 14:13.152
were you? I went to Brownwood.

14:17.115 --> 14:17.716
Camp Bowie. Camp Bowie.

14:23.482 --> 14:34.092
I was sent to Camp Bowie to be cadre for the new Corps 
after the 8th Corps moved out of Brownwood. and

14:35.675 --> 15:04.737
whenever we interviewed the provost marshal 
there were four majors and of the four majors he

14:35.675 --> 15:04.737
said where did you come from where'd you come from 
where'd you come from where'd you come from what

14:35.675 --> 15:04.737
did you do before then i was the one who had been at 
fort benny as a small arms instructor and then the

15:05.746 --> 15:09.931
The provost marshal said, well, who's the senior 
officer? And then he said, well, let's not look at

15:11.052 --> 15:13.015
that. He said, we've got one man here with 
experience in handling arms, so he'll be in charge

15:13.035 --> 15:19.803
of this group. And we never knew who was the ranking 
officer. Four majors, and I was in charge.

15:28.433 --> 15:30.876
After being there a month, the 8th Corps was to move 
out and we were to be in the 18th Corps. And on

15:39.981 --> 16:00.662
Saturday, before the Corps was to move out Sunday 
morning, I was called in and offered the job of

15:39.981 --> 16:00.662
headquarters

15:39.981 --> 16:00.662
company commandant to go to Europe with 8th Corps. 
And I said to the chief of staff do i have to take it

16:04.336 --> 16:33.313
and he said well no and i said well look you people 
have known for 30 days that you were going overseas

16:04.336 --> 16:33.313
and you've prepared your family and you've taken 
your shots and you've done all of these things

16:04.336 --> 16:33.313
necessary and i said if i have to do everything in 
one day that you've had 30 days to do i won't be able

16:04.336 --> 16:33.313
to see my wife have i got it the opportunity to 
decline.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.773
It had been a great assignment. But my wife and 
daughter was out there that I wouldn't see. And I

16:45.417 --> 16:51.683
said, well, I just am going to turn it down because I 
don't want to leave my wife and daughter stranded

16:45.417 --> 16:51.683
out there. And so I didn't go with them. When the 
18th Corps was activated, I went out to Wachuga,

17:02.420 --> 17:05.524
came back Christmas. And I'd been friendly with a 
fellow that was in Wachuga with me, Wirtz and I. And

17:15.738 --> 17:25.671
three days after we got back from Wachuga,

17:15.738 --> 17:25.671
Wirtz was field officer of the day. And a request 
came in for field grade officers to go on an

17:31.782 --> 17:33.384
overseas assignment. And before I got there, he 
had volunteered my name and his name to go on this

17:35.126 --> 17:43.456
foreign assignment. Now, who is this? A fellow by 
the name of Wirtz. W-E-R-T-Z? Yeah. And Wirtz and I

17:50.264 --> 17:53.948
were together until we got to India. So you leave 
Camp Bowie? We left Camp Bowie. On the 3rd or 4th of

18:01.803 --> 18:11.236
January, and within five days, I reported to Camp 
Meade in Maryland. And then to India? We stayed in

18:14.440 --> 18:20.428
Camp Meade in Maryland for nearly three months. 
And I went back home after we'd been there two or

18:21.970 --> 18:29.280
three weeks and had been processed. They said, if 
you've got any leave, why... you can take leave

18:32.043 --> 18:35.569
now. And I took 15 days leave and went back home 
about the end of February, first of March. And by

18:44.422 --> 18:50.712
the way, when I went back home on that leave, we 
ordered another baby in our family. And I didn't

18:52.094 --> 18:56.481
know my wife was pregnant until I got the overhand 
in Africa. And when I found out about it, I wrote

19:00.325 --> 19:08.296
back, well, I knew it was going to happen because 
every palm tree in Orianne had a stork on it. And we

19:08.416 --> 19:12.462
stayed in Orianne for quite a long time. And then we 
went on to Africa, and I was field officer of the day

19:12.962 --> 19:22.736
on two occasions, going across the Atlantic. And 
then when they left Orianne, it was five days later

19:23.817 --> 19:28.003
until my turn came up. And the interesting thing, 
as far as I'm concerned, is the fact that there were

19:28.844 --> 19:36.375
four men that I outranked. And 245 that outranked 
me. But one of them was,

19:42.664 --> 19:47.831
can't get the name.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.801
It'll come to him in a minute, maybe. But he later 
came home and was in Eisenhower's cabinet as one of

19:59.371 --> 20:06.583
the Army cabinet members. And then after he left 
the cabinet, he was president of the University of

20:07.885 --> 20:13.955
West Virginia. And in one of the last issues of a 
magazine I got, he wrote a letter saying that we

20:15.117 --> 20:22.830
were liaison officers. but nobody has written 
anything about the liaison officers. I hope

20:27.867 --> 20:29.309
somebody does. That was in one of the last issues 
that I had. Elvis J. Starr was his name. S-T-A-R-R.

20:40.264 --> 20:44.350
S-T-A-R-H. R-H, okay. Elvis J. S-T-A-R-H. And? I 
really wouldn't recognize the man today if I saw

20:51.143 --> 21:00.015
him, but I knew who he was when we were going. So you 
go to Africa, then to India? Right.

21:08.888 --> 21:18.501
On the trip from O-Ran, we found an American 
soldier in the medical corps who was a native of

21:08.888 --> 21:18.501
China who was sent to America to study art. And the 
government said, we don't need any more art. You go

21:25.435 --> 21:30.440
to University of Wisconsin and study 
engineering. Very fluent in both English and

21:32.001 --> 21:35.145
Chinese. And the stupid Americans sent him to 
China not as an interpreter, but as a medical corps

21:36.006 --> 21:44.775
man. And from the time we left Oran until we got to 
Bombay, we studied Chinese two times a day. We

21:55.410 --> 21:59.395
didn't know we were going to China until we were 
halfway across the Atlantic. And when we opened

21:59.455 --> 22:06.804
our stuff going across the Atlantic, we found a 
Chinese language book there. And that told us

22:06.844 --> 22:08.606
where we were going. And we had a man on the board 
this year who was a principal from some town in

22:16.075 --> 22:21.983
Newark, and he taught us contract bridge. I played 
a lot of auction bridge when I was in A&M, but he

22:22.724 --> 22:40.209
taught us contract bridge so that I got two things 
on the trip from Oran to Bombay, how to play

22:22.724 --> 22:40.209
contract and how to speak Chinese. And

22:40.410 --> 22:44.175
I In all of my writings, I use a lot of Chinese terms, 
many of them which I've forgotten. And much of the

22:50.121 --> 23:03.436
material that's in my memoir about World War II is 
refreshing of my memory by the letters that I wrote

22:50.121 --> 23:03.436
my wife. Now, when did you arrive in China?

23:07.741 --> 23:13.487
I was posted with the 64th Regiment as a regimental 
liaison officer on the 22nd of June, 1944. And that

23:20.484 --> 23:26.413
was the same time I got a job at San Gabriel at $90 a 
month. And whenever the combat was over and we were

23:28.476 --> 23:38.711
put back in the forest in reserve, a lieutenant 
colonel came out there and took charge of it. And he

23:38.731 --> 23:43.137
was left out there till it was ready to go back in 
combat And they replaced him, and I took back my job

23:43.606 --> 23:48.231
as regimental. But I was a battalion liaison 
officer when he was in regiment. But as soon as it

23:54.318 --> 23:58.743
got time to move out, he didn't go into combat. 
Right. Briefly summarize your Chinese

23:59.984 --> 24:03.908
experience then. I don't really have anything. I 
don't have the bitterness that so many of the

24:05.430 --> 24:13.579
people that were over there had. My comment would 
be very friendly toward the Chinese. They were

24:23.153 --> 24:26.537
more polite than I ever could be. One of my officers 
that I was with told me that one of the differences

24:26.577 --> 24:42.655
in culture between China and America was the fact 
that Chinese did not give negative answers, and

24:43.495 --> 24:55.926
that you had to be smart enough to know when a no was a 
yes, or when a yes was a no. And many Americans

24:56.587 --> 25:04.594
couldn't stand the lie that their counterpart. 
And I never had any problem with it, but I'm

25:04.614 --> 25:13.182
convinced that liaison officers were destroyed 
in combat because they wouldn't

25:14.005 --> 25:22.936
go along with this idea of having to make that 
decision. And they'd talk to the Chinese about

25:23.756 --> 25:29.563
lying and whatever and whatever and whatever. And 
they'd walk down a trail and they'd say, well,

25:29.703 --> 25:36.552
we've got to have a new liaison officer. And how 
long were you over there? Well, I got to Burma. I got

25:43.452 --> 26:05.224
to Bombay on the 2nd of June and I was in Calcutta for 
two days and then I went from Calcutta to the

25:43.452 --> 26:05.224
headquarters in in Burma within two days after we 
got to Calcutta and I got there maybe the 15th

26:05.879 --> 26:09.445
before I got down to my final assignment on the 
22nd. And that's 1944? That's right. And you're in

26:14.895 --> 26:17.680
the Far East until when? I flew out of Burma in an 
airplane with four Mews on Christmas Day, 1944.

26:26.717 --> 26:29.642
And I was flown into China because the Japanese 
were threatening the last airport that the

26:29.943 --> 26:37.851
Americans had in China. They had already captured 
all the rest of them. But then this last airport was

26:40.894 --> 26:45.999
very important. And we went down there about the 
15th of April. And on the 8th of May, we were

26:52.085 --> 26:58.752
entering combat. We heard about the German 
surrender. The Japanese started moving back.

27:05.552 --> 27:20.649
They

27:05.552 --> 27:20.649
had put a

27:05.552 --> 27:20.649
group of soldiers on top of a mountain, sometimes 
two miles or three miles from the canyon. The

27:22.591 --> 27:28.317
Chinese had to eradicate those groups up there. 
regimented commander took me up to the top of a

27:28.837 --> 27:33.445
mountain that they had captured. And there was a 
hundred dead Japanese on that mountain,

27:34.626 --> 27:41.578
unburied, when we got there. And that was one of the 
most horrifying sights I've ever seen. Dead

27:48.129 --> 27:51.895
soldiers and smell and so forth. Chinese removed 
their dead. and buried them. How did you and your

27:57.507 --> 28:04.555
colleagues know that the war in the Far East was 
over? How did you learn that? Well, I was in

28:08.400 --> 28:16.469
Chickaya, in that canyon, about 20 miles down the 
canyon. And when I heard about the negotiations

28:17.270 --> 28:24.679
for the surrender, I went to the headquarters. and 
said, look, when am I going home? Because I had more

28:28.966 --> 28:34.413
points than enough to go home. And they say, oh, 
you've been frozen. You're going to Nanking. And

28:40.541 --> 28:45.828
on the 2nd of September, we were standing beside an 
airplane. And whenever the official notice came

28:45.848 --> 28:53.398
that the Japanese had surrendered, we got on that 
airplane. Four officers and maybe seven enlisted

28:55.760 --> 29:00.187
men, and flew to Nanking. And I was working on the 
airport at Nanking from the time that, from let's

29:00.687 --> 29:14.929
say the 3rd of September until after the surrender 
on Double Ten Day, October the 10th.

29:20.998 --> 29:25.024
I never had, I was actually very fond of, the 
regimental commander that I served with from the

29:25.763 --> 29:37.299
time we left the

29:25.763 --> 29:37.299
position back in the jungle. Colonel Lee was a very 
fine man. That's L-I? L-E-E, way I'd pronounce it.

29:44.129 --> 29:45.050
No, but it's spelled. Probably L-I.

29:49.616 --> 29:51.619
And I did more I played bridge with Generalissimo, 
not Generalissimo, the commanding general of the

29:52.342 --> 30:01.657
22nd Division many times. While we were back, when 
we weren't in combat, I played bridge a lot. I spent

30:08.028 --> 30:11.213
a lot of time writing to my people. And we were told 
to destroy anything that we had received. before

30:19.038 --> 30:20.399
we moved out. And so my daughter was born on the 21st 
of October, and I didn't know that she was here

30:21.741 --> 30:30.569
until the 10th day of November. And there was a 
squadron of, I mean, a unit of L-5 airplanes,

30:32.531 --> 30:48.707
little airplanes that delivered things all over 
the country. And they'd come by and say, what are

30:49.379 --> 30:52.184
you doing today? And I said, oh, I don't have 
anything to do. So they said, come go with me. And I

30:55.289 --> 31:01.360
went all over Central Vermont while they were 
airdropping mail to units or whatever. And one

31:02.843 --> 31:07.491
time I looked up like that and there was the 
Irrawaddy River right up there. That guy was

31:08.713 --> 31:10.436
flying upside down. And then he started down. And 
he made a lot of speed. But when he got to the ground,

31:16.770 --> 31:20.293
the dust came up around us. And all of his buddies 
came over there to find out why we crashed. And when

31:27.281 --> 31:32.806
he got out of that airplane, his hand was shaking so 
much he couldn't light his cigarette. He was going

31:33.187 --> 31:34.828
to scare me, and he did. But I enjoyed flying. And 
after I married, I dreamed about flying those. I

31:45.376 --> 31:49.523
could fly those as well in my dreams as any of them 
could over there. But I didn't really have

31:51.226 --> 31:59.238
anything that made me bitter about the Chinese. 
Alright, what about the Japanese? How did you and

32:02.223 --> 32:05.007
your colleagues feel about the Japanese? Well, we 
didn't like the Japanese. They called my name on

32:08.293 --> 32:10.416
the next day after I joined my unit and said that 
Major McNeil is with the 64th Regiment and he is not

32:10.953 --> 32:28.528
a part of the Chinese Army, he's a spy. And if we 
capture him, we'll treat him as a spy. Now, how,

32:33.573 --> 32:35.895
they called you on the radio or what? No, they, 
Tokyo Rose called. Tokyo Rose, okay. Somebody was

32:40.045 --> 32:45.652
keeping them well informed about whatever 
happened in Burma. Did you hear that broadcast?

32:48.916 --> 32:51.739
See, I had a liaison team with me. I didn't have a 
radio, but they had a radio and they listened to

32:51.840 --> 32:57.767
Tokyo Rose and that's what they told me the next 
day. I have the impression that those men who

32:59.409 --> 33:10.002
fought in World War II in Europe have a far more 
positive opinion today about their German

33:10.690 --> 33:18.397
opponents than do the Americans who fought in the 
Pacific have about their Japanese opponents. I

33:20.139 --> 33:22.881
don't quite understand your statement. The 
veterans of your generation who fought against

33:23.502 --> 33:32.950
the Germans don't dislike them nearly as much as 
the veterans who fought against the Japanese.

33:33.330 --> 33:33.971
That's right. Why? Well, the Japanese have no 
concept of anything but brutality. If they

33:44.207 --> 33:50.015
captured an American officer in Burma, they 
hanged him immediately. If you read about the

33:50.876 --> 33:58.026
story of the rape of Nanking, you understand the 
mentality of the Japanese. Did you see some of

33:58.466 --> 34:03.112
those results personally? Not when I got to 
Nanking. It had been years before. No, but I'm

34:07.198 --> 34:10.262
talking about did you see some of their cruelty 
anywhere else? Well, I don't know that I did, but I

34:11.828 --> 34:25.287
also

34:11.828 --> 34:25.287
heard so much about them that I despised the 
Japanese. How did they treat the Chinese? They

34:27.910 --> 34:29.733
treated them very badly. And on

34:30.795 --> 34:40.468
one occasion, a

34:30.795 --> 34:40.468
unit of battalions was ordered to capture the top 
of a hill. They made 11 assaults to the top of the

34:45.669 --> 34:51.197
hill and were not successful. And the regimental 
commander went over to see what the problem was.

34:59.888 --> 35:05.816
And he executed the commander of that battalion 
and took charge of it. And he captured the top of

35:06.857 --> 35:09.561
that hill. But there were only 79 soldiers that 
were alive on top of that hill out of a battalion of

35:10.132 --> 35:18.803
700 or 800 men. And when I questioned them about it, 
they said, well, our soldiers are fatalists.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.338
I don't know whether that's the right word or not. 
But said if they got wounded, they got sent to a

35:32.379 --> 35:37.025
hospital. If they got killed, They didn't have to 
fight anymore. And the Chinese word that applies

35:42.349 --> 35:46.875
to that is Meoganchi. What does it matter? And I 
really had a good command

35:50.099 --> 35:58.791
of the Chinese language when I was with them. 
Right. Do you remember your reaction when you

36:01.494 --> 36:08.083
heard about the first atomic bombs? I didn't know 
anything about it, but Wirtz told me after we got to

36:09.650 --> 36:18.899
China that they were working on it. Now, Wirtz was 
in the office of General Hershey, and so he knew

36:20.220 --> 36:29.869
things that I didn't know. All right, but what 
about when you all heard that it had been dropped on

36:29.910 --> 36:34.034
Japan? I wanted to go home.

36:44.041 --> 36:44.542
What next?

36:49.249 --> 37:04.631
You heard about the surrender, and how long was it 
after you heard about the surrender before things

36:49.249 --> 37:04.631
began to change and you all knew that you would get 
to go home? Well,

37:04.651 --> 37:12.883
we went to Nanking on the second day of September.

37:15.428 --> 37:25.837
And we knew that we would be able to go home when we 
completed our mission. When we completed our

37:27.378 --> 37:32.963
mission, there was no supply people there. And the 
arms that I had carried, I gave to the Chinese. And

37:39.789 --> 37:44.473
they in turn gave me sabers. that were captured 
from the Japanese officers. I have one out in my

37:49.804 --> 37:55.631
garage, and I gave one to my son who went to Vietnam. 
And he lost his when the house burned that he was

37:55.651 --> 37:59.116
living in. It doesn't look like much now, but I've 
got the Japanese saber yet. All right, so in

38:07.106 --> 38:11.191
September, and then when did you get home? Well, I 
left. Nan King spent a day or two in

38:14.947 --> 38:26.960
Shanghai as a way station to Kunming. And I stayed 
two or three days in Kunming and flew into

38:27.540 --> 38:32.205
Calcutta. And I stayed in Calcutta for two or three 
weeks. And they had a ship that was in there. And

38:41.194 --> 38:43.637
they filled it up. They had so many rooms in that 
ship that were for field grade officers. And they

38:49.674 --> 38:56.662
came and said, now every one of the rooms 
designated for field grade officers have been

38:49.674 --> 38:56.662
taken.

39:01.127 --> 39:09.657
They said, you can sign up to go home on enlisted 
men's quarters, but you need to go see where it'll

39:01.127 --> 39:09.657
be. And I said, look, where is the list to sign? that 
you'd go home on enlisted men quarters. I didn't go

39:18.238 --> 39:19.540
look at it. And I came home in the stairwell of, they 
had a bunk, in the stairwell, and I slept in that

39:20.621 --> 39:31.253
bunk. So when did you get home? Fifth day of 
December. Of 1945. Right. Describe seeing family

39:37.299 --> 39:41.704
and other loved ones Well, I had given Colonel 
Miller a letter when he was in charge of the airport

39:43.895 --> 39:53.427
after we took it over. And Colonel Miller came to 
the airport, and I was the person that he saw. And I

40:02.798 --> 40:11.269
want you to know he really was unhappy about what 
was going on at Nanking, and he unloaded on me. And I

40:12.734 --> 40:19.384
want you to know that that was one of the times that a 
major unloaded on a colonel. And he came back, I

40:21.407 --> 40:24.471
said, take my Jeep. And when he came back, he said, 
Major, I owe you an apology. Said, you're the only

40:29.158 --> 40:33.164
person in Nanking that's doing what they're 
supposed to be doing. And he later came back and was

40:34.446 --> 40:39.734
in, we got real well acquainted. One day,

40:45.117 --> 40:52.126
He asked me to go eat in the headquarters of his uni. 
And at that time, he made some snide remark about

40:53.307 --> 41:00.917
the Kitty Corps. And I said, Colonel Miller, what 
about your wife living in Alvin? He said, oh, how do

41:09.528 --> 41:12.311
you know that? And I said, well, Your wife and my 
wife are good friends. And I wrote a letter for him

41:18.448 --> 41:26.636
to bring to my wife because he said, I'll be flying a 
war-weary airplane home and be there in a week. And

41:28.117 --> 41:29.498
he carried that letter. We went home on the same 
ship. And he carried that letter in his pocket. And

41:36.045 --> 41:42.951
when we got to Seattle, I got in line to call James. 
And I stayed in that line for 10 hours, missed my

41:44.703 --> 41:50.792
evening meal. And I called Jane, and I said, Jane, 
we're here. I'm in Seattle. She said, I know that.

41:59.185 --> 42:01.909
Colonel Miller's wife told me that three years 
ago. You know how, well, you don't know. But it was

42:09.561 --> 42:12.145
not anything it could have been. affected me the 
way that did. I got into San Antonio, checked in,

42:17.355 --> 42:29.953
went to spend the night with one of Jane's 
relatives, got back in there the next morning, and

42:17.355 --> 42:29.953
he walked in after I was halfway through 
processing. And I said, Colonel Miller, have you

42:30.473 --> 42:33.097
still got that letter? And he said, yes, I have, and 
I'm going to give it to your wife. And he did. But he

42:38.364 --> 42:39.786
carried it all the way. He said, I got grounded on an 
airplane in Mountain Home in Idaho

42:40.593 --> 42:55.848
and said we were snowed in for that long and said I 
have got that letter for her. So when did you get

42:57.169 --> 43:03.656
back to Alvin?

43:03.676 --> 43:09.081
Well, I guess about the 6th or 7th of of December. 
And if I remember correctly, we had bought this

43:14.120 --> 43:19.447
farm. And as soon as I got home, we came first to 
Moody, and Jane had rented a house in Moody, an

43:20.869 --> 43:33.025
apartment. And I came to Moody within two or three 
days from the time I left San Antonio. All right, so

43:39.875 --> 43:43.519
you were then, very soon you were on inactive duty? 
That's right. And I stayed in the reserve. What

43:48.145 --> 43:50.948
were you planning to do as a civilian? I was going to 
be on this farm for the rest of my life. And I was

43:55.854 --> 44:01.480
going to be the rural carrier for Moody because 
that was the best job they had in Moody. All right.

44:05.985 --> 44:08.228
Take the story from there. back to A&M? Well, I 
taught in the McClendon County Vocational School

44:11.418 --> 44:18.686
for four years. And I was gone from home and so much. 
And finally, I went into partnership with one of

44:22.250 --> 44:26.335
the veterans. And while I was in that partnership, 
I hurt my back and went to Dallas and spent from

44:27.736 --> 44:38.468
Thanksgiving Day, 1947 1950 to 15th of March 1950. 
And when I got home,

44:44.131 --> 44:58.647
I knew that I had just less than three months to get 
into the veterans training program. So I went to

44:59.288 --> 45:03.392
A&M on the 1st of June and enrolled. Because July 
the 15th was the date that you had to make. And left

45:10.816 --> 45:12.457
the kids here. My wife took me to Marlin every 
morning. I went to A&M and stayed until Friday and

45:17.642 --> 45:20.965
came back. She met me in Marlin sometime Friday 
afternoon or Saturday morning. How had A&M

45:28.291 --> 45:30.973
changed since you left it? And those... eight 
years or so? Well, the biggest change was the fact

45:36.964 --> 45:43.552
that A&M was flooded with veterans. And they

45:45.594 --> 45:56.467
told a story that I told my class. And this story was 
that they put all of the all of the Army veterans out

46:02.384 --> 46:07.472
at Bryan Air Force Base. And they had a prof that 
went out to the Air Corps base to teach classes. And

46:15.385 --> 46:23.078
he'd go out there and get his room ready to preach 
and put his hat on the table. And when they put his

46:23.098 --> 46:29.488
hat on the table, then he'd go to one of the mess 
halls and drink coffee with the mess sergeant. And

46:30.582 --> 46:32.744
he was late coming back. And when he got back, there 
wasn't anybody in the room. They swapped him. And

46:41.211 --> 46:48.697
so the next day, when they came back in, there was a 
big sign on the front of the door on the wall. I gave a

46:50.259 --> 46:53.662
test yesterday and all of you made zero. And they 
started howling.

47:04.838 --> 47:06.540
And he said, well, that's the way it is. You walk my 
class. And when he came to the classroom the next

47:09.585 --> 47:14.311
day, the hat, there was a hat on every room. And I 
told my class that. Have you heard that story

47:17.936 --> 47:19.558
before? And I want you to know that I kept an 
accurate record of attendance while I was at A&M.

47:28.470 --> 47:31.875
And I never had a class to walk me while I was 
teaching. I was on the program one time and the

47:32.716 --> 47:44.716
graduate student was supposed to teach my class, 
but he forgot and they walked him, but they never

47:32.716 --> 47:44.716
walked me while I taught. Now you enrolled in 1950 
and what was your goal in terms of a degree at that

47:45.938 --> 47:51.827
point? Well, I had already
