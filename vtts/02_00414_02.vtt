WEBVTT

00:01.111 --> 00:13.807
The

00:01.111 --> 00:13.807
American commissioner, Mr. Lawson, didn't want 
to do anything.

00:13.847 --> 00:24.300
We started to make decisions, to see if we could get 
this or that, and we couldn't get anything. That

00:25.192 --> 00:27.595
they don't take those 50,000 acres. They were 
going to take 50,000 acres that the dam didn't

00:27.635 --> 00:33.562
need. The commission wanted to buy the acres at $12 
or $15 to sell them now at $500 or $1,000 for the

00:33.642 --> 00:46.098
increase in the dam. It didn't want the landowners 
of Zapata to take advantage of that value. But

00:50.926 --> 01:14.757
seeing the political movement of General 
Eisenhower and

00:50.926 --> 01:14.757
the Republican chairman in Texas, Mr. Porter, he 
was very interested in our luck and he began to

00:50.926 --> 01:14.757
manage with President Eisenhower, until 
President Eisenhower gave the order to the

01:15.023 --> 01:38.483
Commission of Limits to not take that land, to only 
take it to where the water would reach, so that the

01:15.023 --> 01:38.483
water would be left to the owners, and that there 
would be some facilities, and thanks to that, it

01:15.023 --> 01:38.483
was built. But, I repeat, the intention of the 
Commissioner of the Limits was for Zapata to

01:39.239 --> 01:45.828
disappear.

01:50.175 --> 02:06.057
And

01:50.175 --> 02:06.057
Porter...

01:50.175 --> 02:06.057
Porter was the one who took this matter very 
seriously. He took him to the Congress and

02:07.201 --> 02:29.445
he was the first one to get those 50,000 acres of 
land and he got us some facilities to change our

02:07.201 --> 02:29.445
lives. And as things are, there's not even a street 
here in Zapata called Porter. There should be a

02:35.599 --> 02:42.986
street called Porter, and there should be a street 
called Eisenhower. Because they were the ones who

02:43.006 --> 02:46.449
helped a lot. But after the prison, things were 
better in Zapata than Guerrero? Now I think so.

02:53.936 --> 02:58.260
Zapata is a town that goes up and grabs a new one. Why 
not? What happened with Guerrero? Well, first of

03:00.593 --> 03:08.824
all, they don't have a branch of life nearby. The 
life they have are ranches. Most of the rich

03:12.349 --> 03:21.682
ranchers

03:12.349 --> 03:21.682
or rich farmers live in Nuevo Larero. In Nuevo 
Larero. They don't live there. They don't live in

03:24.185 --> 03:26.128
Guerrero. Guerrero is exploiting tourism a 
little bit, but... And fishing? The fishing that

03:34.099 --> 03:35.663
goes there... But not much, right? And there is no 
other type of business there? It's just

03:44.249 --> 03:47.073
commercial. There are a lot of shops here. There 
are a lot of shops here. There are times when all the

03:56.347 --> 04:06.763
motels and all the tourist courts and all the 
trailer courts and all that are full. And there's a

04:07.570 --> 04:11.315
lot of people here. All of these things are full 
here, but in Guerrero there's none. Oh, yes. It's a

04:18.344 --> 04:24.693
problem, perhaps, of failure or lack of tourism 
there. Lack of tourism. The people who were

04:26.715 --> 04:36.328
interested in making camps for tourists so that 
the tourists could spend a week or two there to make

04:26.715 --> 04:36.328
money, right? No hay esa facilidad. De aquí sí, 
aquí hay muchos. ¿Y en qué pueblo está la gente más

04:43.528 --> 04:46.872
contentado?

04:49.615 --> 04:59.447
Pues, francamente, yo creo que los de Guerrero 
están satisfechos con su pueblo y nosotros

04:49.615 --> 04:59.447
estamos satisfechos

04:49.615 --> 04:59.447
con el nuestro. In other words, life is different, 
but the good things about life are the same. Well,

05:10.027 --> 05:14.834
no, that's not exactly what I want to say. Life is 
different. Yes, there is... I don't know how to say

05:20.322 --> 05:21.604
it. In general, the effort of the

05:22.141 --> 05:46.782
population

05:48.550 --> 05:58.071
El trabajo de la Comisión de Límites Mexicana fue 
mejor allá que el trabajo que hicieron aquí. Pero

05:58.392 --> 06:04.585
el esfuerzo del pueblo de Zapata fue mejor aquí que 
allá. Ah, yes, it's a thing of spirit. Spirit,

06:09.792 --> 06:11.054
that's it. That's the correct word. And Zapata had 
more spirit. Yes, yes. Courage. Courage, courage

06:20.886 --> 06:22.829
is correct. And those of Guerrero are more... Yes, 
they have... Well, many people of Guerrero live or

06:25.072 --> 06:30.078
have their ranches. They sell their ranches, they 
sell... They are content with the life of a

06:32.594 --> 06:41.607
rancher. Here, for example,

06:42.508 --> 07:02.517
there are many cases in which a person was paid 
$2,000 for his house over there, and he came here

06:42.508 --> 07:02.517
and made $10,000. And here you

07:03.458 --> 07:15.015
need more work to make a town like the old one. More 
words, more work from the people. But maybe this

07:20.583 --> 07:26.952
work is something that makes I attribute it to my 
branch,

07:27.758 --> 07:46.278
the last branch

07:27.758 --> 07:46.278
of mine was the water plant. I always

07:46.318 --> 07:53.125
consider that La vida de los pueblos y el porvenir 
de los pueblos depende mucho del sistema de aguas.

08:02.751 --> 08:11.279
Un pueblo que tiene un buen sistema de agua, hay una 
razón por qué venir a vivir aquí. La planta de agua

08:11.859 --> 08:20.968
yo les estuve ayudando a manejar esta una 
temporada.

08:23.024 --> 08:36.062
El record que tiene aquí la planta de agua de Zapata 
es que en 20 años no ha tenido una muestra de agua

08:23.024 --> 08:36.062
contaminada. Puede decirse que el agua que se toma 
aquí en Zapata es completamente

08:37.284 --> 08:43.953
pura. Es segura, no hay peligro de 
contaminaciones. Y eso atrae mucho, ¿verdad? Sí.

08:53.095 --> 09:00.426
Some people who think in a place of good people to 
come and live in peace and all that. The

09:00.466 --> 09:03.591
sombrerista Zapata has a very good water plant. 
And he comes and he brings another one. And

09:08.278 --> 09:19.655
the other little towns like Lopeño and Palcón and 
Ramarito? Ramarito. Ramireño. ¿Cómo se dice?

09:25.891 --> 09:27.492
Ramireño. Ramireño. Ramireño. Ramireño. Bueno. 
¿Es de su familia? Sí. Ramireño. Era mi papá. ¿Sí?

09:35.501 --> 09:36.642
Ramireño. Ramireño. En esas gentes, muy 
especialmente de Falcón y de Gueloteño, hay

09:38.104 --> 09:49.056
todavía un esfuerzo mayor de las gentes. Here in 
Zapata? In Zapata 9?

10:02.754 --> 10:10.504
Yes.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.443
But I've seen a lot of small towns. But they claimed 
that if Zapata had the right to take them out, why

10:13.624 --> 10:20.052
not us? And they didn't want to take them out. They 
had to go out alone. And they did it again, the

10:25.860 --> 10:37.015
ranchers, Lopeño and Falcón, and they were... 
Lopeño and Falcón were thrown into the water of the

10:25.860 --> 10:37.015
dam. They told them to leave, but they didn't pay 
them so they could leave. Because they didn't pay

10:40.630 --> 10:44.418
the houses until later. They didn't pay them back. 
But frankly, Lopeño, and especially Falcón,

10:50.491 --> 10:57.906
because Falcón and Lopeño are growing more, 
Porque Falcón quedó cerca de la cojina, de la

10:58.409 --> 11:04.715
presa. Ah, es un local muy bueno, correcto? Y 
Falcón Heights.

11:12.663 --> 11:17.568
Falcón

11:12.663 --> 11:17.568
Heights. Sí. Allí en esos pueblos yo considero que 
fue mayor el espíritu de... To preserve. To

11:27.715 --> 11:32.720
preserve their people, because they didn't help 
them in anything. They didn't make them pantheons

11:32.761 --> 11:35.243
or anything. No? They told them that here was the 
Zapata pantheon that they wanted. And they made

11:40.950 --> 11:45.154
them in this Zapata pantheon. This is for Falcón. 
It's for everyone. Yes, but they didn't want to.

11:49.499 --> 11:50.500
They didn't want to. They wanted to stay in 
their... In their lands. Their ancestors wanted

11:54.822 --> 12:01.408
them to be in their... Well, I understand, I 
understand. And they made their own pantheons

12:01.669 --> 12:06.753
with the cooperation there. I had the 
satisfaction of having cooperated with them. I

12:12.158 --> 12:19.885
went and brought them the Falcon Pantheon and the 
Lopeño Pantheon. I also... I brought it. The

12:22.437 --> 12:26.724
Ramireño one, I also brought it. I'm also a fan of 
Grimesor. But nothing else? A fan, right? I'm not a

12:32.433 --> 12:46.875
fan, but I saw one of those people so... so involved 
in the effort to make their town against... Those

12:32.433 --> 12:46.875
towns are so beautiful. Yes. Well... Falcón 
helped a lot. A son of Falcón who lives in San Diego,

12:53.171 --> 12:59.498
over there. Yes. He came and razed a town. He 
brought some engineers and razed the town. And he

13:08.169 --> 13:12.574
told them, there's the town that was razed. 
Whatever they give you for the solar of old Falcón,

13:17.240 --> 13:37.346
San Ignacio is

13:17.240 --> 13:37.346
viejo todavia,

13:17.240 --> 13:37.346
si? San Ignacio intentaron echarlo fuera tambien 
pero se defendieron.

13:46.754 --> 13:50.820
Y dio la orden al presidente de que no lo movieran. 
Oh. ¿Y qué fue posible esto? Pues, la razón técnica

13:56.768 --> 14:06.142
era que de ninguna manera le llegaba el agua a San 
Ignacio. Sí. Yo veía yo una cosa un poco

14:08.065 --> 14:16.677
discriminatoria.

14:19.255 --> 14:22.402
San Ignacio had a lot of agricultural land. Yes. 
Agricultural land for irrigation. Yes. And it had

14:29.496 --> 14:34.206
its people there. There's a tourist park in San 
Ignacio, over there, very high, in a hill. Do you

14:38.194 --> 14:39.998
remember the high park? San Ignacio is over there, 
a place that is very high. Yes, it's high. I passed

14:46.281 --> 14:48.464
through San Ignacio that day. Before you got to San 
Ignacio? Yes, it's very... Very beautiful? Very

14:53.930 --> 14:56.432
beautiful, with the... It has there a... Very old 
buildings and the, how do you say, sandals. The

15:00.997 --> 15:02.359
thing for the sun. Ah, yes, the sandals. Ah, yes, 
those are in the front. Yes. Yes, it's very

15:06.455 --> 15:09.119
beautiful over there. It's quite tall. It's old. 
And there on that hill, they drew the line of

15:10.481 --> 15:25.923
expropriation from the outside, taking it to San 
Ignacio with all its 8,000 acres of irrigation.

15:26.404 --> 15:26.685
Yes. On the other hand, on the other side of the 
hill, the terrain is the same as that of San

15:26.705 --> 15:35.938
Ignacio, except that there the owner was 
Millionaire. He was American. They didn't

15:40.586 --> 15:42.628
expropriate it there, just for here. What was his 
name? His name was Minkum. Minkum. Oh, I saw him at

15:47.912 --> 15:50.034
his ranch. I saw him and he said, it's a village. No, 
it's not a village, but there's a house in Loma.

16:00.844 --> 16:01.584
It's his house. It's a house in Minkum. In where? In 
Loma? No, no, it's in the Andoma. The Andoma, yes.

16:09.668 --> 16:12.711
It's a big ranch house. Very big. Very big, very 
beautiful. Yes, it's a millionaire. Yes. My

16:17.736 --> 16:22.780
daughter says, she wants this house. And I say, 
yes, me too. And then? My eldest son is dead. Now he

16:26.945 --> 16:31.329
has the ranch, the son. Ah, yes. My daughter is also 
very poor. Cuando ya se interesó Porter y

16:36.483 --> 17:03.823
consiguió la orden del presidente de que no tomara 
la comisión de límites más terreno arriba de la

16:36.483 --> 17:03.823
elevación, la elevación a 3.07, 3.07,

16:36.483 --> 17:03.823
elevación

16:36.483 --> 17:03.823
sobre el nivel del mar, Y San Ignacio está arriba de 
307, está como en 325. No había razón por qué tomar a

17:12.149 --> 17:15.615
San Ignacio. Se fue la línea de expropiación, se 
fue por la orilla del agua. Sí. Y se fue porque se

17:24.471 --> 17:27.617
salvó. Well, in San Ignacio it is very different 
from Zapata. Because it is ancient. Yes, it is very

17:37.299 --> 17:45.730
ancient and there are not many businesses or 
anything. What is your idea of the comparison of

17:45.750 --> 17:51.917
life here and in San Ignacio?

17:55.019 --> 18:05.148
Well, the reason I see why San Ignacio is now 
declining is because the main life of San Ignacio

17:55.019 --> 18:05.148
is agriculture. Agriculture too. And 
agriculture is very declining. All those

18:09.251 --> 18:16.597
villages in the valley that had a lot of 
agriculture, they don't go up, they go down. Here,

18:17.678 --> 18:24.604
for San Diego, Benavides, there is a lot of 
agriculture. They go

18:26.120 --> 18:32.613
back and forth. It was a time when the cattle came. 
The one that has cows now has a lot of money. Vacas

18:43.180 --> 18:47.666
ahora son buenos para el dinero. Y la agricultura 
está un poquito... Sí, la agricultura es poco

18:48.788 --> 18:55.877
abajo, pero los ranchos son poco arriba. El farmer 
no tiene mucho lugar. No, los con vacas. Pero San

19:03.307 --> 19:05.290
Ignacio... San Ignacio, when we came here, was 
richer than Zapata. It had more population,

19:12.913 --> 19:19.161
more trade. It even had something very original. 
It didn't have Zapata. There was a kind of social

19:26.591 --> 19:31.698
classification. Yes. There was a club there of 
rich people, of aristocrats. From San Ignacio?

19:39.992 --> 19:41.314
From San Ignacio. Oh, aristocrats from San 
Ignacio. Who was it? The Uribe people. Those

19:49.243 --> 19:51.446
people, Uribe, Martín. Sánchez, Martín. And they 
had clubs and all? But there is something very

19:57.173 --> 20:00.117
meritorious for San Ignacio.

20:03.370 --> 20:24.621
que en aquellos días en que venimos nosotros y 
todavía hasta los 20, después de los 20,

20:03.370 --> 20:24.621
la gente de San Ignacio se interesaba más por las 
escuelas que la gente de Zapata. Y tenían ellos su

20:26.704 --> 20:30.610
propio distrito escolar. And they were very 
straight men, very honest men. And San Ignacio

20:37.396 --> 20:41.460
always had better schools than Zapata.

20:44.302 --> 20:51.909
In Zapata, the schools depended a lot on politics, 
or the politics depended on the schools. And they

20:53.210 --> 20:58.235
had teachers to vote for them, whether they were 
good teachers or not. And in San Ignacio, no. In San

21:01.167 --> 21:20.071
Ignacio, after 1925 or 1929, when I was in charge of 
the treasury of the schools,

21:01.167 --> 21:20.071
San Ignacio had its own district. And it always had 
the best teachers. That's why you can see that the

21:25.498 --> 21:28.322
kids of San Ignacio they look more prepared. In 
those times? In those times. Not now, because it

21:34.754 --> 21:37.738
changed here. Ah, yes. Well, in which year did 
these changes come? From the schools? Yes, from

21:45.168 --> 21:46.790
everything, from life. For example, in which year 
were Zapaka higher and San Ignacio lower? The

21:53.319 --> 21:57.364
schools, the school system changed, I think, When 
they changed the town, I think. I don't remember,

22:03.394 --> 22:10.041
because in San Ignacio they don't have a primary 
school anymore. No, there was only a primary

22:10.141 --> 22:13.505
school. They are, I think, from six or eight, they 
come here. Six or eight. I think that, well,

22:17.990 --> 22:18.710
exactly. And then it is necessary for them to come 
here? They come here in buses. And if there is a

22:24.076 --> 22:26.018
school there too, College

22:26.403 --> 22:37.935
Station.

22:40.918 --> 22:54.773
College

22:40.918 --> 22:54.773
Station.

22:55.293 --> 22:56.435
Universidades? Yo creo que hicieron un solo 
distrito escolar aquí en Zapata porque ya el

22:56.475 --> 23:19.292
gobierno

22:56.475 --> 23:19.292
del gobierno escolar aquí en el estado tomó más 
interés en la educación y ya no permite que ocupen

22:56.475 --> 23:19.292
maestros a base de A favoritism. A favoritism. 
Now, every teacher needs to bring a certificate.

23:30.671 --> 23:31.012
Yes. And things have changed. Kingsville is very 
close. Kingsville is very close, yes. Many

23:38.702 --> 23:41.326
children from here went to these universities? 
Yes, many went to Kingsville. Many? They have gone

23:47.352 --> 23:51.839
to Laredo, like now, Laredo also has courses. Yes. 
Teachers, teachers. Yes, for teachers.

23:58.369 --> 23:59.751
Professors, yes. Yes. And business. Yes. And 
nursing. Nursing. I think those three are

24:05.400 --> 24:12.972
materials, they just finish their exams and they 
have to go to take them, it will be... Dallas or... I

24:16.505 --> 24:18.408
don't know. And the people from San Ignacio also 
went to... Also. Also, many went to the

24:22.733 --> 24:25.077
universities. It's a lot of... But before there 
was that demand from the state, that

24:26.679 --> 24:42.300
the judge of the county was the one who put teachers 
and removed them and all that, San Ignacio, it can

24:43.276 --> 24:59.135
be said that since 1900, or before 1900, until 
1920, San Ignacio had an independent district.

24:59.195 --> 25:04.822
And it was very well managed, and they had a time of 
very good teachers. In 1906 or 1907, they had a

25:04.882 --> 25:11.190
professor, Hart, who made records. Then, in our 
time, they had Cunningham,

25:12.250 --> 25:23.630
and they had Dr. Wallace, who was also a professor. 
They always had better teachers than Zapata, and

25:25.593 --> 25:29.460
better paid. But not now. Not now. They are the 
same, in that sense. And the

25:37.985 --> 26:04.684
people.

26:05.052 --> 26:11.405
Usted dice que no quieren salir de Zapata Viejo. 
¿Cómo se dice sobre ellos? Que no quieren

26:15.193 --> 26:17.036
progreso. Pues no, como nosotros teníamos que 
salir. Sí. ¿Cuándo la pensé? If we wanted to or not,

26:26.635 --> 26:31.682
we had to leave, right? That's how it is that all of 
us left. All of us left. And we couldn't live in

26:35.668 --> 26:38.291
other places. We all didn't have a place. Well, 
there are some families who take their children,

26:42.777 --> 26:48.966
maybe they go to Marietta or Antonio or other 
places. But since they have changed to live in

26:49.066 --> 26:55.495
other places, everything has changed. Although 
they

26:56.707 --> 27:01.837
didn't want to. That little question of yours 
makes me assume that you already read out there

27:02.038 --> 27:10.855
that there was a group that didn't want the prison 
to be built. Yes. Yes or no? No, that was a political

27:15.805 --> 27:18.310
question. No había una sola persona que se 
opusiera a la construcción de la presa. Todos

27:24.495 --> 27:35.507
estábamos dispuestos a cederle al Valle la 
oportunidad de que hicieran la presa para que les

27:24.495 --> 27:35.507
beneficiara a ellos. Lo único que queríamos 
nosotros era que nos pagaran. Sí. Pero como había

27:41.213 --> 27:46.018
mucha política, el grupo contrario al nuestro He 
said that we were oppressing him, but it wasn't

27:46.268 --> 27:52.216
true. It was an infamous

27:52.236 --> 27:57.343
lie. I think that all the people, when we thought we 
had to leave and leave the town, they didn't leave

27:57.363 --> 28:11.423
us a little disappointed. Because we were going to 
leave everything there. Naturally, it hurt to

28:14.067 --> 28:15.769
leave Yes, sentimental

28:17.217 --> 28:24.458
things.

28:26.384 --> 28:28.189
The trees. All the contractors would come and 
bring them home. No, no, no. They would take them

28:34.778 --> 28:38.181
out and throw them away. I had planted them when 
they were little and I needed them so they could

28:38.201 --> 28:41.785
grow. And when I saw them take them out and throw 
them away, I was sad. Yes, it's a very sad thing for

28:46.749 --> 28:50.452
grandparents. Yes, we saw that everything... And 
they, none of them, they would put the tree and they

28:50.552 --> 28:57.298
would say, A device. Yes. And they would throw it 
away. And they would throw it away. Those things

29:05.570 --> 29:06.911
were what we felt. But that is purely sentimental. 
Sentimental. Of the old things. Yes. Houses of

29:13.521 --> 29:15.904
many years. Yes. Yes. Yes. It is a very important 
thing. The discomfort that was seen was that the

29:20.591 --> 29:25.598
Commission of Limits According to the 
authorities in the

29:26.557 --> 29:44.577
county, you have been committed to bringing the 
whole county here to Zapata.

29:45.078 --> 29:53.307
And instead of having gathered the people and 
having told them, man, we're going to have to get

29:45.078 --> 29:53.307
out of here, what do you want? Those people from 
Falcón said, we want you to do with us what you're

29:54.299 --> 30:00.828
going to do with Zapata. What more does Zapata have 
than us? And they didn't see them. They paid them

30:08.038 --> 30:12.424
and they came and made their town and made their 
pantheon. And there they have them, they go up.

30:17.772 --> 30:18.733
Falcón goes up. There's oil in Falcón. Oh, oil in 
Falcón. Bueno, yo he oído que hay personas de

30:22.784 --> 30:33.160
Guerrero que nunca salió del pueblo viejo. ¿Es la 
verdad? Muy pocas, pero... ¿Qué clase de gente

30:35.623 --> 30:41.532
están ellos que no salieron? Porque no les llegó el 
agua. Ah, un parte de la ciudad no está. Sí, porque

30:46.620 --> 30:49.264
el pueblo viejo era así. But only the

30:50.290 --> 31:07.234
people who had houses in the upper part of the city 
were there? Yes, the English were there. But

31:12.785 --> 31:34.405
they still

31:12.785 --> 31:34.405
lived

31:12.785 --> 31:34.405
there?

31:34.840 --> 31:36.905
But with electricity? In Guerrero Viejo they 
don't have anything. Nothing? No roads, no

31:42.858 --> 31:47.087
electricity, nothing? What did you say? Roads. 
Roads are bad. There are about 15 or 20 families, if

31:53.707 --> 31:59.116
not more. 15 or 20 families. 20 families, maybe. 
100 people, more or less. It's like a ranch. Yes,

32:10.676 --> 32:12.880
it's like a ranch. And from there they make their 
living as they can? They are people who live from

32:16.739 --> 32:23.636
fishing or something like that. Mmm, that's good 
for fishermen. I think agriculture is one of those

32:25.561 --> 32:27.807
things that you do. Yes. It's a very quiet life, I 
think.

32:34.194 --> 32:36.276
Because there's no light. There's no light, 
there's no road, no buses, there's nothing, it's

32:36.296 --> 32:41.601
very quiet. There's no telephone either. No, no 
telephone, it's too quiet, I think. Yes,

32:45.245 --> 32:56.115
well, it's the same thing in a small town that I 
studied in Mexico. Do you know it? The story of the

32:59.603 --> 33:02.588
Mexican Revolution. Yes. I recommend you this 
work. It was lent to me. It's called Historia.

33:09.398 --> 33:13.745
Illustrated electronic of the Revolution. Yes. 
It has the history of the Revolution. But it has a

33:18.833 --> 33:21.417
lot of photographs. Ah, yes. Look, José. I saw it 
there. Look, José. He brings a lot of photographs.

33:32.274 --> 33:33.596
This is one of two. And

33:35.178 --> 33:52.224
the reading is very pleasant because you have fun 
with the monkeys, with the portraits.

33:52.244 --> 33:57.792
Apart from the Revolution, he also brings 
articles. Yes, they are very interesting. Well,

34:03.100 --> 34:10.930
what do you think about the revolution? Was it a 
good thing for Mexico or not?

34:24.333 --> 34:28.319
Well, in part good and in part bad. In part good and 
in part bad? Because in some people, that's what I

34:31.824 --> 34:39.795
think, that there were people who became 
revolutionaries. Yes. And for your family, was it

34:42.159 --> 34:46.925
a good thing or a bad thing, the revolution? Well, I 
would say that...

34:54.742 --> 35:09.607
I think that the so-called

34:54.742 --> 35:09.607
benefits of the practical revolution are not 
immediately sold. I have this idea. against the

35:15.363 --> 35:21.193
opinion of the lady. It is

35:21.273 --> 35:33.574
clear that the revolution

35:21.273 --> 35:33.574
had to come one day, right? We all knew that when the 
revolution came, it had to come a period of

35:35.225 --> 35:45.295
disorder and destruction and a tremendous thing. 
And not only did the revolutionaries destroy the

35:45.315 --> 36:03.173
soldiers of the Federal Army, they believed that 
they were the ones who were defending the

35:45.315 --> 36:03.173
government and defending the institutions. And 
they destroyed the others in a tremendous

36:03.895 --> 36:11.585
way. I consider this from the time of Juarez.

36:22.520 --> 36:31.152
Juarez

36:22.520 --> 36:31.152
handed him over to a president, Lerdo. General 
Díaz made a revolution for Lerdo, and General Díaz

36:32.161 --> 36:43.777
stood up with the principle of no re-election. He 
was in the presidency for four years, and at the age

36:45.640 --> 36:53.190
of four he handed over to his substitute.

36:56.191 --> 37:13.571
But then Congress saw that in every change of 
president there were political problems,

36:56.191 --> 37:13.571
movements, and then Congress authorized General 
Díaz to stay another four years. And he stayed

37:13.591 --> 37:22.061
another four years, and then they told him that he 
could stay as many years as he wanted. I believe

37:22.281 --> 37:25.725
that the dictatorship of General Díaz It was 
necessary. The country was dead. There was no

37:30.160 --> 37:40.811
economy, no schools, no railways, no roads, 
absolutely nothing. And a lot of disorder. Yes.

37:47.237 --> 37:51.040
And an iron hand was needed to put those things. A 
lot of debt. Juárez... he was left to owe to the

37:55.912 --> 38:04.106
United States a general. Then General Díaz, 
during his 30 years of government, the same

38:04.146 --> 38:20.535
revolutionaries recognize him that in 30 years he 
took away from the people the right to vote, the

38:04.146 --> 38:20.535
right to elect president. pero le dio 30 años de 
tranquilidad, fuerza económica, el dinero en

38:21.224 --> 38:37.622
México valía, le dio escuelas, le puso 
ferrocarriles, le puso caminos. A raíz

38:39.344 --> 38:48.835
de cerca del 910 o del 909,

38:49.675 --> 39:01.395
An American journalist had a conference

38:49.675 --> 39:01.395
with General Díaz, and he told him that he thought 
of re-electing. And General Díaz told him that he

39:01.415 --> 39:10.992
no longer thought of re-electing because he was 
already old, And he also noticed that the middle

39:11.731 --> 39:22.766
class was interested in politics, that the rich 
were interested in politics before.

39:25.971 --> 39:31.819
And the people of the center and the lower class 
were not interested. And then he said that he was no

39:33.822 --> 39:36.085
longer reelected. Entonces comenzó el país a 
prepararse para las elecciones y comenzó a ver

39:36.689 --> 39:44.178
grupos... Encontrados. Encontrados. Sí. Y luego 
Madero se fue, era uno de los candidatos, el

39:46.641 --> 39:59.817
general Reyes era otro de los candidatos, y 
comenzaron a pelearse y echarse trancasos allá en

39:46.641 --> 39:59.817
las calles. Entonces alguien le dijo al general 
Díaz que mejor se religiera And that's where his

40:06.608 --> 40:12.378
error was, his religion. And then came the Madero 
revolution. Yes. In 1910. And he was a very popular

40:17.768 --> 40:23.919
president, but by the time he was in the 
presidency, they didn't want him anymore. Yes.

40:25.863 --> 40:30.171
The same people who helped him with the revolution 
began to betray him. Yes. Then came the murder

40:31.229 --> 40:35.154
of... You know that, right? Then came the murder of 
President Madero, and the murder of the Vice

40:35.995 --> 40:48.711
President, and then came the Carnacist

40:35.995 --> 40:48.711
Revolution. And there was a disorder, a disorder 
that didn't stop being harmful. The people

40:54.358 --> 40:58.723
were... Are you from Escalosquena? Yes. Y por ese 
lado, la revolución perjudicó mucho. Pero por el

41:06.658 --> 41:14.427
lado ideológico, puramente decir, ahora sí 
tenemos el derecho de decir no reelección. El

41:16.210 --> 41:18.953
sufragio efectivo, quién sabe. La no reelección 
sí es cierta. Sí,

41:22.578 --> 41:30.227
es cierto en México ahora, no reelección. No. 
Pero... Ahora, pasada la revolución, pues, todo

41:33.538 --> 41:41.529
ha venido dependiendo de sus gobernantes. De la 
revolución para acá, yo considero que el general

41:41.549 --> 41:48.339
Cairo fue un buen gobernante. Y después, este, 
López Mateo.

41:54.408 --> 41:57.953
Este hombre es muy inteligente. A very hard 
worker. A great

42:02.732 --> 42:06.778
orator. Oh, Mr. Lopez Mateos? Yes. And who is that? 
That's me. Oh! Is Lopez Mateos a friend of yours?

42:18.355 --> 42:19.015
Well, yes. When he came as a candidate to Nuevo 
Laredo, I went there to greet him, and there I had

42:19.156 --> 42:26.646
the opportunity. That's where they took me back. 
Yes. What year is it? And what year was this photo

42:31.615 --> 42:41.072
taken? 1960, maybe? I don't remember.

42:48.826 --> 42:51.852
When was this photo taken?

42:57.451 --> 43:02.235
Seis de López Mateos y seis de... Diez Odal. Diez 
Odal. Y ahora Echeverria. Son tres años, son

43:04.537 --> 43:07.300
doce... Son doce años y tres, quince años, así es 
que... Quince años pasado, más o menos. Así es que

43:12.284 --> 43:17.189
son sesenta y tres, cincuenta y ocho. Cincuenta 
ocho, sí.

43:22.694 --> 43:25.416
¿Visita usted en México algunas veces? When

43:26.594 --> 43:35.206
I came, I was in Nuevo Larero. In Nuevo Larero, but 
more in the interior. Do you know Mexico or the

43:38.931 --> 43:41.094
city? I've been to the city of Mexico last year. We 
saw it there on the highway in Guanajuato.

43:47.943 --> 43:49.405
Guanajuato, Celaya. Celaya. For vacation? Yes, 
for vacation. Monterrey, San Luis. And life in

43:57.020 --> 44:04.850
Mexico now is different than in the past? Well, in 
this last trip that I did,

44:04.870 --> 44:19.769
I found improvements

44:04.870 --> 44:19.769
in some branches. For example, in the road 
construction branch, there are many roads that

44:19.789 --> 44:26.858
are very well preserved. And every town has its own 
paved road. In the school area, a lot has been

44:33.323 --> 44:36.126
developed. You can see schools in every town. Yes. 
In the area of... Tourism as well. Tourism. There

44:48.179 --> 44:49.701
used to be little tourism. There is a service for 
tourism. What? There are some trucks on the road.

44:55.829 --> 45:01.556
that if they lack gas, or a tire, or a mechanic, or a 
nurse. I got the impression

45:01.576 --> 45:24.486
that in schools,

45:01.576 --> 45:24.486
on roads, in portable water, it has developed a 
lot.

45:28.043 --> 45:29.407
And it's very close. The lines, those lines. What? 
Those lines, those lines. You can see peace there.

45:38.311 --> 45:43.285
In those three branches, you can see the 
development. I didn't find agriculture

45:44.665 --> 45:54.015
very developed. You have to see that we went to a 
region where there is no agriculture. In the bay,

46:03.946 --> 46:09.812
agriculture is very good.
