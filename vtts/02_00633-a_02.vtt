WEBVTT

00:03.473 --> 00:13.364
I have a 15-second

00:03.473 --> 00:13.364
delay. Once you then talk about these kinds of 
guidelines, management, in effect,

00:13.384 --> 00:30.342
mariculture, aquaculture, pollution control, 
work with the oceans, climate and climatology,

00:13.384 --> 00:30.342
then when you're looking at proposals or these 
sorts of things that you try to direct research

00:13.384 --> 00:30.342
into,

00:33.798 --> 01:00.582
In our program now, what we do is describe the area, 
the general programmatic area that we're

00:33.798 --> 01:00.582
interested in, and then

00:33.798 --> 01:00.582
discuss with the scientific community what kinds 
of research ought to be done, and essentially

00:33.798 --> 01:00.582
respond to the community as they consider these 
regions or these areas and decide from a

01:00.933 --> 01:05.438
scientific point of view what they think ought to 
be done. And what happens is that we finally get a

01:07.620 --> 01:19.733
strong enough signal that a particular

01:07.620 --> 01:19.733
limited part of a program area should be tackled. 
Some of the scientists who are going to lead it

01:19.773 --> 01:30.484
stand up and say, look, it's time that we started 
working on this question. And then what we go

01:31.291 --> 01:34.915
through is a series of steps. If the area is not well 
enough known, and in most cases it's not, then we

01:37.097 --> 02:00.302
sponsor a workshop in which all the experts in that 
particular area of research gather and discuss

01:37.097 --> 02:00.302
the status of knowledge and what are the gaps in the 
status of knowledge, and do a tentative design on a

01:37.097 --> 02:00.302
research project to fill in some of those gaps.

02:01.548 --> 02:12.481
either at that meeting or shortly thereafter, 
either by osmosis or by election or by some

02:01.548 --> 02:12.481
process, a handful of leaders will take the 
leadership and say, OK, we're going to organize a

02:01.548 --> 02:12.481
research program. And now we insist that they make 
this known to the community by putting an ad in

02:13.723 --> 02:24.596
Science or someplace saying, we're going to 
prepare a proposal along these lines of the

02:13.723 --> 02:24.596
National Science Foundation. Anyone who has 
interest and good ideas on how this Problems

02:30.590 --> 02:31.772
should be tackled. Send us a letter and give us your 
thoughts. If it fits, we'll incorporate it into

02:35.276 --> 02:40.623
the task. And if it doesn't, we'll say so. And if you 
don't like our answers, go see the foundation and

02:42.125 --> 02:46.250
tell them that we're giving you a bad time. Good 
shape.

02:50.296 --> 02:59.888
Now, a couple of questions now very quickly on you 
concerning personal comments, which you may

02:50.296 --> 02:59.888
choose to ignore, by the way. For example, given 
the way that the problems you see facing this

03:00.475 --> 03:16.476
country, let's say that in terms of nuclear 
energy, with energy being overlapping problems,

03:00.475 --> 03:16.476
what's your attitude towards developing nuclear 
energy and nuclear waste? Do you feel it should be

03:16.516 --> 03:17.757
stopped? Should it be continued? Do you feel as if 
the oceans can serve as sort of a waste deposit?

03:25.687 --> 03:26.008
That's strange. If you had asked me that two months 
ago, I would have said, No problem. Don't worry

03:32.980 --> 03:33.680
about it. But unfortunately, between then and 
now, I read this rather excellent book on We Almost

03:33.900 --> 03:45.611
Lost Detroit is the title of it. And it concerns 
some accidents that we've already had using fast

03:45.651 --> 03:54.879
breeder reactors and water-cooled reactors. And 
my opinion was that we had self-quenching cooling

04:00.533 --> 04:05.097
fluids for use in these reactors. And it was 
impossible for them to get out of hand, because if

04:05.237 --> 04:14.906
the neutron flux got too high, why, the material 
would just become opaque to neutron flux, and it

04:05.237 --> 04:14.906
would shut down. But apparently, this stuff, the 
fusion, the uranium and the thorium don't behave

04:16.047 --> 04:24.876
like they should. And I guess they develop 
hotspots within the core. And once the hot spot

04:30.250 --> 04:37.077
develops, it can do some damage to the cooling 
system, to the flow of it. And then it ceases to be

04:37.798 --> 04:41.962
cooled correctly, and that hot spot continues to 
get hotter. And so now I'm convinced that

04:43.063 --> 04:58.418
probably, unless we can deal effectively with 
that, and I don't think we can, that we probably

04:43.063 --> 04:58.418
shouldn't be using fission as a major source of 
heat. a power in the future, and it's too bad

04:59.090 --> 05:02.495
because it's so attractive otherwise. I think 
they can deal effectively with the waste. That's

05:07.122 --> 05:07.963
not my concern. My concern is that they are going to 
have some bad accidents and that those accidents

05:08.024 --> 05:16.977
are going to do a lot of harm to a lot of people. So I'm 
not sure it's worth the gamble. Are you optimistic

05:20.563 --> 05:26.291
about the ocean as a producer of food, as an 
oceanographer? Oh, I think so. I think

05:28.790 --> 05:50.572
my view is that now we're about the same point that 
the

05:28.790 --> 05:50.572
country was in 1860 when

05:28.790 --> 05:50.572
we were hunting buffalo. If we had continued to 
improve our ability to hunt buffalo, they would

05:51.713 --> 05:57.379
have disappeared even faster. Instead, we learn 
how to farm and to husband cows and to actually feed

05:57.697 --> 06:11.636
them and collect them together, essentially the 
farming effort that's going on. And I think once we

06:11.696 --> 06:25.915
stop worrying about improving our ability to 
catch fish, start worrying more about how to farm

06:11.696 --> 06:25.915
the seeds, that the seeds can really, you know, 
they can, I think the potential for, supplying

06:26.620 --> 06:42.239
proteins is

06:26.620 --> 06:42.239
certainly not unlimited, but it certainly goes 
orders of magnitude over above what we're talking

06:26.620 --> 06:42.239
about now in the sustained yield of the oceans in 
the natural conditions. Third comment, then, on

06:43.180 --> 06:48.467
these fields you've defined as pressing fields, I 
suppose. How successful will we be in mining the

06:48.487 --> 06:56.256
ocean, producing finite resources from the 
ocean, at a cost which is within some kind of a

06:56.877 --> 07:02.843
bottom line in terms of cost.

07:05.846 --> 07:26.547
Well, I'm certainly not an expert, but I was 
exposed to a rather thorough briefing by

07:05.846 --> 07:26.547
Marquis Sunnyvale, where their manganese nodule 
effort and the Glomar Explorer effort were

07:05.846 --> 07:26.547
housed. This was before the explorer went out and 
picked up a piece of a submarine. But they went

07:32.631 --> 07:46.887
through the whole exercise for, this was at a COA 
meeting out at Stanford, went through the whole

07:32.631 --> 07:46.887
exercise of how they examined, how they decided 
whether or not to go into a field like this. And

07:47.407 --> 07:51.572
their first step was to do a complete market study 
on on present-day mining, on the grades of ores

07:51.974 --> 08:06.094
that are being used to recover copper and other 
minerals, the potential for finding more of

07:51.974 --> 08:06.094
those, the whole market study bit. And they 
decided that the

08:07.175 --> 08:21.255
copper concentrations, for example, in 
manganese nodules, is now better, higher, around

08:07.175 --> 08:21.255
2%. than the copper concentrations in the ores of 
the mines that they're now mining. And therefore,

08:28.112 --> 08:31.796
they said, then it's worth looking into. And then 
they identified all the engineering problems

08:31.856 --> 08:37.462
associated with doing that kind of mining. The 
first study was a million dollar operation. Then

08:42.487 --> 08:49.555
that engineering study was a $10 million 
operation, identifying all the engineering

08:42.487 --> 08:49.555
problems. And they, at that time, were in the third 
step, which costs about $100 million. And that is

08:53.992 --> 08:59.700
tackling the remaining engineering problems. 
What kind of a nozzle do you use to pull them up? Do

09:02.003 --> 09:07.311
you use airlift or dredge or what? And they felt 
that they had essentially solved the major

09:07.331 --> 09:16.825
engineering problems with recovering it from the 
ocean.

09:17.193 --> 09:29.449
The fourth step, which had cost a billion dollars, 
and that is to actually start mining and

09:17.193 --> 09:29.449
recovering the metals from it and marketing them, 
was the one they were about to launch into. And

09:29.609 --> 09:45.951
that's the step at which they felt they had to have 
some assurance, either from the federal

09:29.609 --> 09:45.951
government on how the US government was going to 
protect their interests at sea, or some

09:29.609 --> 09:45.951
international agreement on how they'd operate at 
sea. And, you know, the Japanese are in it, and the

09:46.572 --> 09:51.740
Germans are in it, and the French are in it, and the 
U.S. is in it. And I would guess that within no more

09:53.102 --> 10:03.977
than 20 years, maybe 10, we'll be recovering 
medals from the bottom of the sea. I think once we

10:04.919 --> 10:07.022
start, it's going to get easier. Yeah, but that 
anticipates another question of mine, and that

10:07.042 --> 10:11.989
is, How are you going to use the sea and utilize the 
sea? And how is the foundation going to encourage

10:16.230 --> 10:26.561
projects when it becomes fairly apparent with 
200-mile boundaries, international

10:16.230 --> 10:26.561
agreements, that oceanographers' activities 
will be more and more limited?

10:31.766 --> 10:32.407
Well, I'm not... I think it's going to be more 
difficult for us to operate internationally, but

10:34.049 --> 10:37.953
I don't think it's going to be limited. I think we 
can work out bilaterals and regional agreements

10:37.993 --> 10:42.077
and international agreements. And I'm not really 
pessimistic about being able to do the kind of

10:43.629 --> 10:52.579
research we want to in the future. It's going to 
take a little bit more planning. And it may take

10:54.221 --> 11:04.474
some funding to solicit participation by some of 
those countries that we don't now do. But I think

11:05.475 --> 11:09.820
I'm pretty optimistic that we'll be able to go 
ahead and work.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.554
Good enough. Now, given the problems in fishing 
and international cooperation which are

11:14.714 --> 11:29.228
developing and international agreements, do you 
see oceanography moving in perhaps closer to the

11:14.714 --> 11:29.228
shores? That is, with more and more demand for 
practical oceanography, if I may use that word,

11:29.368 --> 11:43.080
for finding finite mineral resources, and with 
fishing banks, after all, close to our shores

11:29.368 --> 11:43.080
itself Will oceanography come back from the sea 
rather than go back into deep

11:43.432 --> 11:58.795
water?

11:58.815 --> 12:10.232
I think the expansion will be in the shallow water 
areas and in the continental shelf areas, but I

11:58.815 --> 12:10.232
don't see the deep ocean work pulling back from the 
deep ocean. because of that i think the ratio will

12:10.752 --> 12:37.738
change but it won't be because deepwater people 
have moved into shallow water you know there isn't

12:10.752 --> 12:37.738
that much going on in deepwater

12:10.752 --> 12:37.738
the onr and the

12:10.752 --> 12:37.738
nsf are the only ones that support deepwater work 
and all the other agencies work primarily in

12:10.752 --> 12:37.738
shallow water so i you know there will there will be 
a shift in the percentage but it won't be because

12:38.562 --> 12:41.706
the deepwater people pulled out of the sea. If you 
were, in the 20 odd years you've been involved in

12:42.748 --> 12:54.343
oceanography, what do you consider the tools 
which have changed the nature of work in

12:42.748 --> 12:54.343
oceanography the greatest?

13:02.234 --> 13:08.502
Well,

13:02.234 --> 13:08.502
let's see, I would say

13:11.924 --> 13:15.691
Satellite navigation.

13:23.083 --> 13:23.664
STDs.

13:26.129 --> 13:32.660
You know, the Neil Brown type STD.

13:33.582 --> 13:34.303
XPTs.

13:43.717 --> 13:44.678
Curb meter developments.

13:49.903 --> 13:52.045
And the whole raft of geophysical tools.

13:55.228 --> 13:58.410
Seismic reflection, multichannel seismic 
reflection. But even before that, even single

13:58.430 --> 14:01.613
channel seismic reflection and refraction.

14:07.779 --> 14:11.142
The auto analyzer, which wasn't developed or 
oceanographers, but was adopted by them for

14:12.353 --> 14:27.171
measurements of nutrients and chemicals aboard 
ship in large numbers and accurately.

14:27.191 --> 14:30.875
And taking the ship, taking the computer to sea. 
Almost everyone says the computer to sea

14:32.717 --> 14:36.142
someplace. Just imagine where they list it. 
Instant analyzing of data. There have been glory

14:42.560 --> 14:46.465
fields of oceanography, if I may again use that 
term. That is, oceanography essentially began

14:46.485 --> 14:51.312
with marine biologists. Then physical 
oceanographers seemed to come into sway. And for a

14:54.276 --> 14:56.359
while, people involved in nuclear physics. What 
do you think will be the next glory field of

14:56.699 --> 14:59.743
oceanography? You're going to advise us on what 
hard science to study to become an oceanographer.

15:03.368 --> 15:04.129
What would you suggest?

15:13.778 --> 15:22.670
Oh, that's a tough one.

15:27.637 --> 15:35.006
It would either be chemical or physical 
oceanography.

15:35.026 --> 15:40.714
And I guess it would be physics for the next few 
years.

15:43.715 --> 15:51.302
And if you were going to advise an academic 
department on what sort of oceanographer to try to

15:43.715 --> 15:51.302
turn out, what would you suggest?

16:02.373 --> 16:04.194
I would say physics and chemistry.

16:07.157 --> 16:12.102
Now, while you were involved both in your own 
research and as a member of a funding agency, what

16:12.335 --> 16:24.449
program did you feel to be the most successful, and 
what program did you feel to be the most disastrous

16:12.335 --> 16:24.449
fate?

16:24.469 --> 16:26.712
Depends on what you mean, project? Project, 
right, or a project that was to lead to a series of

16:26.772 --> 16:40.047
projects, either

16:26.772 --> 16:40.047
way. Well, I think I had a strong hand at ONR for a 
number of years in developing deep-sea

16:42.625 --> 16:52.537
telemetering buoys. And I thought that's going to 
be absolutely necessary. It's the wave of the

16:57.223 --> 16:58.825
future. We'd better get it developed and get to 
using it.

17:06.487 --> 17:08.269
And I thought I had done everything right. I had set 
up a committee of scientists to advise on the

17:08.289 --> 17:20.442
development of this hardware all the way along so 
that when it was ready, we could just hand it to them

17:08.289 --> 17:20.442
and they'd take it away and use it, and the whole 
bit. And in the end, it turned out that the tool was

17:22.304 --> 17:36.038
so expensive and so unreliable, even after 
putting $10 or $12 million in it, whatever it was,

17:36.828 --> 17:39.111
that it just wasn't suitable as an oceanographic 
tool. And I consider that to be pretty much of a

17:39.872 --> 17:50.067
disaster for which I had a great deal of 
responsibility, if not the whole

17:39.872 --> 17:50.067
responsibility. And I feel bad about it. I just had 
no idea of how much the things would cost in the end

17:54.573 --> 18:04.287
or how difficult it would be to develop a system 
that you could put in the ocean and leave for a year.

18:04.756 --> 18:09.182
without having something go wrong with some piece 
of it that would essentially inactivate the whole

18:04.756 --> 18:09.182
thing. And we spent a lot of money using space 
technology on it, the whole industrial weight of

18:10.404 --> 18:24.884
general dynamics, and failure modes, and 
reliability. And you get all through, you still

18:24.964 --> 18:28.429
don't have a workable tool. And you don't have one 
that

18:35.047 --> 18:39.132
that the community can afford to buy very many of 
them. And so now I've given up developing systems

18:39.152 --> 18:44.237
for oceanographers. When they come in and say, we 
want this system for this research task, then

18:44.558 --> 18:51.786
we'll try and get the system for them. But I've 
given up trying to anticipate what I think they're

18:51.826 --> 18:55.931
going to need.

18:58.934 --> 19:01.577
That's probably one of the biggest failures. The 
most successful program that I've been

19:02.941 --> 19:09.790
associated, had anything to do with, and I haven't 
had too much to do with, is the Climap program. And

19:10.971 --> 19:14.095
this is the, it's an IDOE project. Essentially 
it's a project which the paleontologists who

19:16.298 --> 19:31.277
study fossil fuel, fossil in the deep sea 
sediments, try to say something about the age of

19:16.298 --> 19:31.277
the sediments or when the conditions changed by 
looking at these fossils in the deep sea core. And

19:42.210 --> 19:51.502
up until we supported the Climap program, each 
paleontologist was very excited about his own

19:42.210 --> 19:51.502
work. And he would show you micro photographs of 
forams until you could, you know, you were sick of

19:51.542 --> 19:55.406
them. But there wasn't any, outside of telling 
you, outside of telling the oil companies

19:55.426 --> 20:02.395
whether, what geologic age, was being examined in 
the cores. It didn't tell you an awful lot. But the

20:07.620 --> 20:24.357
scientists at Brown, John Embry, at Lamont, Jim 
Hayes,

20:07.620 --> 20:24.357
at Oregon State University, Ted Moore, put 
together a program with about 25 to 30

20:07.620 --> 20:24.357
paleontologists. And they welded them into a team 
so that they had

20:32.800 --> 20:49.602
each one working on the same core, each one 
obtaining a different bit of evidence on that

20:32.800 --> 20:49.602
core, so that when you put all this evidence 
together and did some statistical manipulation

20:32.800 --> 20:49.602
with it, you could say what the ocean temperature 
was at that time, at that place, at the surface. And

20:51.044 --> 20:57.833
they developed a map of the Ice Age Ocean 18,000 
years ago. They induced the global atmospheric

21:02.365 --> 21:15.179
modelers to use that data, that picture of the 
global ocean, to examine their own models and the

21:02.365 --> 21:15.179
constants that the modelers were using. Just a 
very, very successful program.

21:25.209 --> 21:30.415
If you were to suggest, as a matter of fact, To young 
oceanographers,

21:32.572 --> 21:38.861
what sort of an education should they receive? 
That is, hard science, schools of oceanography.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.808
What direction should schools of oceanography 
take them? What would you suggest? Should they get

21:46.953 --> 21:51.379
a general oceanography degree, or should they 
major in a hard science like you did? Should

21:51.679 --> 21:59.631
oceanography be only graduate study, or should it 
be undergraduate study?

21:59.651 --> 22:01.093
Well, I think there's

22:03.807 --> 22:17.725
There's no question in my mind that you need a 
thorough grounding in whatever

22:03.807 --> 22:17.725
basic science you're going to operate in before 
you come into oceanography, because

22:03.807 --> 22:17.725
oceanography is just the application of that 
science to the oceans. So if you get an

22:18.406 --> 22:30.642
undergraduate degree in oceanography, you don't 
have any strength in any particular field, not

22:18.406 --> 22:30.642
physics, not mathematics, or anything else, and 
you really end up more at a technician role than you

22:31.313 --> 22:35.559
do at a researcher role. And some of the most 
successful people have gone on and got their PhDs

22:36.281 --> 22:50.182
in the hard science, in chemistry or in physics, 
and then come into oceanography as a matter of

22:36.281 --> 22:50.182
interest. And in fact, that's where they all came 
from initially. And that's still where many of the

22:54.268 --> 22:58.034
good ones come from. But oceanography is 
training. their own experts now, very

23:01.638 --> 23:06.586
successfully, they can compete with. Monk came in 
that way, and Stommel came in that way. All of the

23:10.271 --> 23:19.726
older group of people, it's the only way they could 
get in, as a matter of fact. But I would certainly, I

23:19.746 --> 23:29.721
think,

23:19.746 --> 23:29.721
if you want to say I'd like to work in the field at the 
technical level, at the technician level, then

23:30.157 --> 23:31.699
you get an undergraduate degree. But if you really 
want to do research, your own research, an

23:31.959 --> 23:41.150
advanced way forward, you really have to have an 
undergraduate degree in a basic science. Which

23:41.171 --> 23:47.558
oceanographer possibly had the greatest 
influence on directing your career? On my career?

23:50.061 --> 23:50.562
Your career.

24:02.945 --> 24:11.134
Well, you know, not from a professional point of 
view, but from...

24:02.945 --> 24:11.134
And I guess that's not the question. The question 
is from a professional point of view. I take it from

24:12.976 --> 24:13.897
any point of view. Well, you know, obviously 
Maxwell taught me in the coming into the field, and

24:14.017 --> 24:25.129
he coerced me into going to Washington, so he had a 
profound impact on my career. As far as...

24:31.210 --> 24:46.227
professional end of it, I suppose Ted Folsom, who I 
worked with closely for about six years before I

24:31.210 --> 24:46.227
joined ONR, probably had the most,

24:31.210 --> 24:46.227
the largest impact. Have you had any regrets that 
you chose to become a, may I use the word, political

24:48.569 --> 24:56.017
oceanographer rather than an academic 
oceanographer? No, no, I don't, I'm not a,

24:59.577 --> 25:03.323
particularly strong research type. And I faced 
that

25:03.483 --> 25:08.831
shortly after I came to ONR. I decided I surely had a 
better management capability than I had a

25:08.852 --> 25:14.580
research capability. And so it was not really 
difficult for me to make the decision. And I

25:18.046 --> 25:19.408
certainly never regret it.

25:32.045 --> 25:35.710
Are you going to say a few words about where you 
think the focus of research will be? Yeah, by that I

25:35.730 --> 25:39.616
don't mean in physics or in chemistry. What I 
really am referring to is the annual decision or

25:40.637 --> 25:58.963
the annual approach by Congress to put all of 
oceanography into one super

25:40.637 --> 25:58.963
agency.

26:00.850 --> 26:16.068
In this country today and

26:00.850 --> 26:16.068
since the early 60s, the real oceanographic 
strength of this country has been at the academic

26:00.850 --> 26:16.068
institutions, at the universities. And I think 
this is the reason that the country leads the world

26:16.088 --> 26:24.158
in oceanography, because of the academic 
atmosphere. and the impact of the students on

26:24.779 --> 26:32.386
their professors in tackling various problems 
and in keeping them sharpened up. And so I get

26:32.606 --> 26:45.278
concerned when we talk about giving 
responsibility for supporting research to an

26:32.606 --> 26:45.278
agency with an in-house capability. And I'm going 
to do whatever I can to make sure at the basic

26:52.927 --> 27:15.810
research component, the research component of 
the country stays that the university is

26:52.927 --> 27:15.810
supported through grants and contracts from 
whatever source, and that that pot of money is

26:52.927 --> 27:15.810
protected very carefully by the federal 
government, from inroads, by in-house

26:52.927 --> 27:15.810
laboratories. And I have a strong conviction from 
my days at ONR and watching the Air Force turn the

27:20.737 --> 27:36.537
responsibility for their basic research in 
geophysics over to the geophysics research

27:20.737 --> 27:36.537
directorate, which was a laboratory up in 
Massachusetts, and then watching their contract

27:20.737 --> 27:36.537
research program disappear. It's very easy to 
say, well, I need a million dollars because I've

27:37.318 --> 27:45.127
got a laboratory with a whole bunch of civil 
servants in it. And therefore, we just take it away

27:45.147 --> 27:48.972
from the contract research program. this year, 
give it back next year. And, you know, just this

27:52.813 --> 28:00.283
continual encroachment of in-house versus 
contract research. It's kind of insidious. Now,

28:01.825 --> 28:04.188
by in-house... I mean in-house Navy labs, NOAA 
laboratories, EPA laboratories. I think these

28:12.479 --> 28:19.127
are necessary for carefully applied research and 
to answer questions that these... that these

28:19.597 --> 28:21.540
agencies need for their own mission. But I get 
concerned that, for example, in the Sea Grant

28:22.562 --> 28:39.327
Program, which is in NOAA, that they might have 
difficulty protecting that from other parts of

28:22.562 --> 28:39.327
NOAA, because it's a grant. a grant program. 
Universities are violently opposed to this idea

28:40.875 --> 28:45.625
of a super agency to administer funds. This is one 
of the common things that oceanographers talk

28:46.346 --> 28:49.052
about. So you think the fear may well be from 
competition with in-house agencies? Oh, I don't

28:55.490 --> 28:57.212
know whether that's their fear or not. I think 
they'd like to have more than one place to go to. All

28:59.996 --> 29:01.137
right, now that's what I said. Their words always, 
what I always hear is we'd like to have several

29:01.157 --> 29:12.272
agencies to try our ideas out on because an agency 
tends to favor certain kinds of ideas and become

29:01.157 --> 29:12.272
sort of locked into those ideas. Yeah, I think 
it's, I think their concerns are

29:12.292 --> 29:20.923
valid ones. And in fact, the foundation, the whole 
foundation's policy is to encourage other

29:21.612 --> 29:28.402
agencies to support basic research. But when you 
start talking about an agency

29:29.343 --> 29:49.493
or an office which will be responsible for all of 
oceanography or all of environmental sciences,

29:29.343 --> 29:49.493
or in the case of energy, all of energy, you have to 
be very careful about how you set it up.

29:49.962 --> 30:01.018
particularly with regard to the basic social 
research component that's just a holly horse

29:49.962 --> 30:01.018
right around well i'm interested in that i want to 
ask more questions about that
