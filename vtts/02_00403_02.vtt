00:01.583 --> 00:03.947
And what's your specialty in political science? 
Public administration, which is... What's your

00:04.167 --> 00:08.113
field? Geography. Well, it's a long story. I'll 
turn this off in a minute, and then I'll tell you all

00:12.540 --> 00:15.665
mine. Well, the reason I ask what your field is, pub 
ed is kind of a... It's a hybrid. On the one hand,

00:23.857 --> 00:27.743
it's a kind of intellectual activity with... 
epistemological concerns, you know, and

00:28.128 --> 00:32.133
philosophical concerns. And then there's a great 
deal of grubby how-to kind of thing. And so it's not

00:38.482 --> 00:43.929
a specialty that turns undergraduate or graduate 
students on, you know. And so I always feel a bit

00:45.311 --> 00:53.282
apologetic for it, you know, because there's so 
much more exciting things, so many more exciting

00:45.311 --> 00:53.282
things to study in political science than I 
thought I had. But somehow it was impressed on me

00:53.903 --> 00:57.848
very early that... One of the fields they always 
need people in in public political science is pub

00:58.148 --> 01:09.482
ad, and I suppose as a result of employment 
experience, all this kind of thing, I'd always

00:58.148 --> 01:09.482
been kind of practically argumentative. So this 
would explain that. I suppose if I had that to do

01:12.225 --> 01:21.456
over again, I could be assured of a job, I would have 
as my specialty normative political theory,

01:23.309 --> 01:29.820
because here you read all the good literature, you 
have sexy things to talk about. But at that time,

01:32.324 --> 01:37.253
there just was no demand for people to teach 
normative theory. Well, why political science?

01:39.917 --> 01:42.702
Can you think of any reason why you got involved in 
that? Well, I've always liked history. I've read a

01:45.420 --> 01:46.662
great deal of history. I like literature. I'm an 
undergraduate minor. I have an undergraduate

01:49.825 --> 01:54.850
minor in English literature and more in 
economics, major political science. I've always

01:55.751 --> 01:56.632
liked to read. And I think it's just probably 
similar to hundreds of thousands, perhaps, who

01:57.172 --> 02:04.800
were turned on by a professor. And in this case, the 
professor was not particularly charismatic.

02:08.332 --> 02:18.923
Certainly not a dynamic speaker or a magnetic 
personality, very matter-of-factly, but he

02:08.332 --> 02:18.923
interested me in subject matter, and it was sort of 
a cumulative process. You know, I got interested

02:18.943 --> 02:22.026
in it and would take more of it, got more interested 
in it. And Utah State, where I finished my

02:22.046 --> 02:28.353
undergraduate work, had a very small political 
science department. I think there were only three

02:28.373 --> 02:33.478
people, but they were first-rate as teachers and 
as researchers. And it was just a very happy

02:34.454 --> 02:40.202
experience, and the same thing carried through my 
entire graduate experience. So it was just, you

02:40.222 --> 02:43.065
know, a fortuitous series of events. It was when 
you finished your doctorate that you went to Peru?

02:46.249 --> 02:53.459
No, I taught for, I got my first teaching job at 
Colorado College in Colorado Springs, and I

02:46.249 --> 02:53.459
taught there from 62 until 67. When I went to Peru, 
and I came back to the college, and then left in 68.

02:59.952 --> 03:01.594
But I had taught for five years. And came here? Did 
you come here? No, it's long story. I resigned in 68

03:05.478 --> 03:07.821
from Colorado College. I went to the University of 
Denver for two years. I went to Memphis State

03:09.323 --> 03:14.729
University for two years, and then I came here. 
Don't ask me why, because it's terribly

03:14.749 --> 03:17.672
self-seeking. You know, a perfect opportunity. 
And you've been here for? I came here in September.

03:25.482 --> 03:26.242
In this city? Yes, this is my first. I completed my 
first.

03:34.647 --> 03:38.492
And you were first in Mexico, in Juarez, after 
coming here. Yes, I was interviewed here a year

03:38.732 --> 03:46.883
ago, January, and Ed took me over to Corona. It was 
the first time, basically. I've been back often,

03:49.326 --> 03:59.620
and Polly and I want to go down, and I've almost 
convinced myself that I am going to go to La

03:49.326 --> 03:59.620
Veracruz. I know I have family there. But I keep 
dragging my feet. I can't really explain why. You

04:08.406 --> 04:15.337
know, I make up all sorts of convenient excuses 
that, you know, I have to work this summer, or

04:08.406 --> 04:15.337
Bobby's got to go to camp. At least I knew why I'm 
reluctant to go back. That's interesting. How did

04:19.925 --> 04:21.488
you react to Juarez? Very well, very well. I was 
delighted by the Spanish, you know, and the

04:24.853 --> 04:28.279
culture. I was used to the poverty already as a 
result of being in South America. And this is just

04:31.847 --> 04:33.849
the condition, the fact of life. I'm hauled by it. 
There's very little I can do about it. The poverty,

04:36.933 --> 04:39.236
the extremes of wealth. But I don't think the 
stereotypic response of being appalled by the

04:40.838 --> 04:51.370
dirt, this kind of thing, I suppose it's part of my 
culture. I am delighted to be here. It's a delight

04:54.394 --> 04:57.237
to go to the Union and hear Spanish spoken. 
delightful community to speak Spanish with my

04:57.571 --> 05:02.478
students, of the diet. Maybe this is why I feel a 
little strong compulsion to get to Mexico, in the

05:02.779 --> 05:10.831
sense of going down, because so much of it is here. 
What is your perception of Mexico? Do you think of

05:12.533 --> 05:16.039
it as a relatively dynamic country right now? What 
do you feel about the revolution? Do you think

05:17.761 --> 05:25.553
it... Yeah, I think that as far as I'm concerned, 
it's the first genuine social revolution that

05:17.761 --> 05:25.553
we've ever seen. even more genuine than French, 
because they substituted one regime with another

05:26.258 --> 05:32.804
dictatorship. I think that it's really the 
unfortunate thing about the Mexican Revolution

05:32.824 --> 05:40.531
is that it happened in a small country. It was

05:40.571 --> 05:49.239
ultimately powerless. And it's gotten no press, 
which is worse than a bad press, and therefore

05:49.259 --> 05:53.363
nobody knows about it. And so to this extent, I 
think that Mexico's revolution as a contribution

05:54.862 --> 06:02.849
has been overlooked. And it's only been recently 
with the scholarship of Womack, for example,

06:03.330 --> 06:08.895
people are regarding the Mexican revolution 
seriously. But even in South America, they don't

06:08.915 --> 06:12.799
think of the Mexican revolution as a model. They 
think of Castro's revolution as a model. It's very

06:15.501 --> 06:17.483
interesting. My previous students, anyhow. And 
this is why I say I think they've got no press as

06:19.164 --> 06:24.109
opposed to a bad press or a good press. But I'm very 
prideful of the Mexican Revolution, because it

06:25.017 --> 06:33.025
was, in my job, the first genuine social 
revolution. And I'm very prideful of the heroes

06:33.725 --> 06:37.449
that emerged. I think a great deal of this is 
romanticizing.

06:41.813 --> 06:43.815
But this is a latter-day acquisition. I think not 
until I was about 35 or 36 did I really feel

06:44.536 --> 06:52.003
confident enough to face up to my own background in 
America. I'm not really apologetic for it. I can't

06:57.098 --> 06:58.039
justify it. But I do try to reason with myself and 
say it's understandable, given the conditions

06:58.940 --> 07:07.752
under which you were brought up, to react in this 
way. Sort of just make the whole thing invisible.

07:12.338 --> 07:21.450
But do you have any sense of the amount of, say, 
socioeconomic progress made in Mexico, say, in

07:12.338 --> 07:21.450
the last 15 or 20 years? This would be 
intellectual, on my part, rather than

07:22.814 --> 07:26.420
experiential firsthand. And I think that there is 
considerable in that. There isn't the starvation

07:32.650 --> 07:40.583
that my mother used to talk about, except for the 
Indians, perhaps, in isolated areas. There's not

07:40.623 --> 07:42.866
the brutalization that there was. The Urales, for 
example, don't kill half the countryside at will.

07:49.527 --> 07:50.588
without retribution. So I think in this sense, 
there's been a quantum leap. Now, if you measure

07:54.673 --> 08:02.423
the advances they've made, say, compared to the 
advances that the industrialized nations of the

07:54.673 --> 08:02.423
North made, well, they're still dragging behind. 
Well, do you think of Mexico as being essentially

08:02.623 --> 08:07.810
an urban industrial nation or approaching that 
point? I think of it as being mixed. I wish I could

08:10.874 --> 08:15.079
label it in one of Rob Stout's seven stages, but I 
don't. I think that it is industrialized in the key

08:15.700 --> 08:20.885
industries, petroleum, railroad, what else, 
mining. But I also see a great deal of agriculture

08:21.866 --> 08:27.973
providing the livelihood for thousands of 
people. And so to that extent, I think that it's

08:28.053 --> 08:37.343
still approaching the stage of 
industrialization in the modern Western

08:28.053 --> 08:37.343
American, Japanese sense of the word.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.568
But I think that... that there has been a 
demonstrable increase in the quantity and

08:44.202 --> 08:49.207
quality of life. I was reading something, I can't 
remember where, just in the past week, that we

08:49.227 --> 09:00.338
really don't have a regular starvation in the 
world anymore, with the exception of India,

08:49.227 --> 09:00.338
perhaps. But the person was arguing that instead 
of being pessimistic and saying we're really in

09:00.478 --> 09:12.150
very bad shape, we should face up to the fact that we 
don't have the families, we don't have the

09:00.478 --> 09:12.150
scourges of the past, We've really come a long way 
in the sense of medical advances, dietary

09:12.518 --> 09:18.084
advances. And so if you use this as an index, it 
would seem that Mexico would qualify as making

09:18.104 --> 09:26.373
this sort of quantum jump.

09:27.915 --> 09:31.039
I can't give an example firsthand. But I get the 
idea that while people have to work very hard in

09:31.659 --> 09:39.488
Mexico, and that their diet isn't what it might be, 
this is still better than the misery that was there

09:39.940 --> 09:46.248
when my parents were growing up there, when people 
would starve to death. What about the class

09:46.268 --> 09:48.290
system? To what extent do you think of Mexico as 
being a nation with a strong middle class? I don't

09:53.857 --> 09:55.539
think it's got a strong middle class. I think it's 
got a strong upper class, even though I have a

09:55.559 --> 10:06.893
colleague in the department who is Mexican 
national who denies this and says, well, this is my

09:55.559 --> 10:06.893
imagination.

10:08.189 --> 10:29.073
No, I don't know whether this, my reaction comes 
from my reading of Mexico, my experience in South

10:08.189 --> 10:29.073
America, but I have a feeling that in the countries 
I've been in Mexico, which we just did, or Mexico

10:08.189 --> 10:29.073
and Peru, is that there's a very, very strong upper 
class orientation in the sense that the upper

10:08.189 --> 10:29.073
class dictates morals, mores, manners. Would you 
compare Mexico with Peru in this sense? Not in this

10:33.057 --> 10:36.441
sense, because Peru, at the time I was there, Now, 
you've got to remember that Alvarado has been

10:36.792 --> 10:41.998
there since, and he's changed things quite a bit. I 
said Alvarado, I meant Velazquez in Peru. And so

10:47.343 --> 10:54.171
there may be a diminution or dilution of the class 
structure since Alvarado was there just five

10:47.343 --> 10:54.171
years ago. But I still see very strong overtones of 
this. For example, in restaurants in Mexico, I see

10:59.156 --> 11:03.881
the... In Juarez. Juarez, yes. I think here at El 
Paso, you know, I see a very patronizing attitude

11:06.155 --> 11:18.114
on the part of educated Mexicans to their 
compatriots, you know, who are clerics, mediums,

11:06.155 --> 11:18.114
whatever. So this is what I'm basing my impression 
on. And I feel a certain amount of this towards me.

11:22.220 --> 11:25.165
Now, I have a colleague here, his name is Leonardo. 
And as you can imagine, we chat frequently about

11:26.567 --> 11:30.673
these things. And one of the things we noted is that 
there is a tendency on the part of Mexicans to look

11:32.210 --> 11:41.781
down on Mexican-Americans who are in Mexico, even 
if the Mexican-Americans are professional, as he

11:32.210 --> 11:41.781
and I are. And there's Néstor Valencia, who is a man 
in local government. He's known the same thing.

11:46.966 --> 12:02.183
And I think these impressions which we have 
experienced have convinced us that although you

11:46.966 --> 12:02.183
can't perhaps quantify this in an empirical 
study, that there is a definite class, upper class

11:46.966 --> 12:02.183
bias in Mexico, in my experience, which I think is 
acting as a governor, inhibitor, or retarder of

12:02.872 --> 12:20.956
the revolution to the extent that they see their 
own purpose as being endangered by too much

12:02.872 --> 12:20.956
democratization or too much redistribution of 
wealth. Have you ever run into many Mexican

12:23.059 --> 12:31.731
nationals who talk of themselves as clase media 
and who take tremendous pride in being middle

12:23.059 --> 12:31.731
class? You haven't encountered much of this. No, 
because I think that the people who are

12:33.642 --> 12:42.154
professionals still consider themselves 
members of the Catholic media, but members of the

12:33.642 --> 12:42.154
upper class. Jose Luis, for example. He may be, 
indeed, upper class. You would agree with Richard

12:46.680 --> 12:52.087
Adams, one of my old professors.

12:52.287 --> 12:55.151
He just says the upper class keeps getting bigger, 
in effect. Yeah, that's right. That's

12:55.912 --> 12:56.853
essentially... They co-opt. You see, the middle 
class, are supposed to be defined as the mechanic,

12:59.740 --> 13:04.606
automobile mechanic, you see, who we would 
consider working class. Because there's a

13:05.147 --> 13:10.273
voluntary co-optation process at work, if I can 
call it that. It was the guy who becomes a ,, a ,, an

13:10.413 --> 13:17.802
intellectual, a journalist. The minute they get 
the titulo, they become members of the upper

13:18.883 --> 13:23.669
class, you see, rather than members of the group. 
Now, we might define them on our standards in terms

13:23.689 --> 13:28.515
of income as middle class, but they consider the 
job, in my judgment, as well as the upper class.

13:30.256 --> 13:31.798
Jose Luis is a good example. And this is supported 
by what you know from this particular area. Yeah, I

13:36.644 --> 13:38.827
would think so, yeah. I'm curious. You know what 
I'd like for you to do? Professor, when you do go to

13:42.652 --> 13:55.650
Mexico, and I hope you go for a long enough time to 
have it soak in, like a month or two, I'd like for you

13:42.652 --> 13:55.650
to keep a diary. A very impressionistic diary, 
because I think it could be a very fascinating

13:56.238 --> 14:01.869
thing. I'm sure, yeah. I've done diaries, you 
know, from time to time. I suppose like most people

14:07.601 --> 14:11.349
who start a diary, they let them lapse very, very 
soon. I've not thought about it. You seem to have a

14:13.333 --> 14:16.018
very different image of Mexico.

15:46.887 --> 15:49.438
What was that?

16:44.583 --> 16:49.729
Oh, and then after that, after I'd already paid my 
fees, I put my card packet over to turn it in. The

16:51.091 --> 17:07.289
dear little lady sitting there collecting the 
card packet says, oh, well, you'll have to take it

16:51.091 --> 17:07.289
over to housing and get your housing card stamped 
before I can take your card packet. I've already

17:07.309 --> 17:08.230
paid my fees. She says, yes, but you have to go to 
housing. So I had to go to housing. And for the

17:12.781 --> 17:17.509
umpteenth year in time, I have the permission to be 
on campus.

20:20.701 --> 20:21.549
One o'clock. I'm only making beds this morning.

23:43.724 --> 23:50.462
Yes.

23:50.482 --> 23:50.562
Yes.

24:38.028 --> 24:42.120
You

24:38.028 --> 24:42.120
want to put it on? No, not that hand.

29:55.885 --> 30:03.015
That

29:55.885 --> 30:03.015
is crazy. Some guy had it. I don't remember.

31:16.379 --> 31:25.304
What's the towel doing on the tape recorder?

31:25.324 --> 31:25.665
What?

31:28.634 --> 31:28.935
What? Where's the little plug?
