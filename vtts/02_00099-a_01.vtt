WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:04.333
Two, three, four, one, two, three.

00:04.993 --> 00:05.114
Four.

00:06.856 --> 00:09.219
This is Monday, February 26th.

00:09.239 --> 00:10.140
Yes, sir.

00:11.242 --> 00:21.716
Out in the beautiful new home of Charles and Diana Hall out on Kemp Road, not far from the river west of the campus.

00:22.777 --> 00:26.882
And we're going to start off by chatting about his student days here.

00:28.625 --> 00:31.168
First of all, introduce yourself by where

00:31.435 --> 00:32.456
Talk about your family.

00:34.058 --> 00:34.879
Grew up where?

00:35.019 --> 00:36.141
Went to school where?

00:37.823 --> 00:43.149
Describe yourself before coming to Texas A&M.

00:43.169 --> 00:51.098
Well, I was born in the woods outside of LaRue, Texas in Henderson County.

00:51.439 --> 00:52.900
Athens is the county seat.

00:53.862 --> 00:55.924
21 of May 1933.

00:58.537 --> 01:19.355
Shortly thereafter my father who was a sixth grade dropout, still trying to farm, moved to the Rio Grande Valley near Wesley Cole, Texas looking for a little better wage than he got in the cotton patch in East Texas.

01:21.577 --> 01:28.003
Ran a service station, ran a nice house, farmed, anything to

01:30.194 --> 01:36.019
Yep, put food and shelter for four children.

01:37.561 --> 01:39.543
I'm the second of four sons.

01:43.326 --> 01:59.982
In 1939, we moved from the Rio Grande Valley to Aransas Pass, just 19 miles up the coast from Corpus, and I went from the first through the ninth grades at Aransas Pass

02:02.088 --> 02:30.188
And it was during this time, during my last year there, my freshman year in high school in 1946, that I had the wonderful fortune of meeting Miss Ree McCullough, who was dating an Aggie somewhere off in some mysterious place called College Station, Texas.

02:32.733 --> 02:34.896
That Aggie, by the way, his name was Charlie.

02:34.976 --> 02:39.861
I wish I knew what his last name was so I could find him again to find her.

02:40.562 --> 02:51.175
But she was always coming to College Station to visit Charlie and vice versa and always talking about Texas A&M and all the wonderful things that they did.

02:51.215 --> 02:59.905
And just by having that exposure to Miss McCullough, for the first time in my life, I thought about

03:01.117 --> 03:06.585
the possibility of even going to college and having been raised on the farm.

03:07.666 --> 03:18.602
Farming was the only thing that I ever thought that I would want to do and all of this was reinforced with all of the movies that all of us kids saw in those days.

03:18.682 --> 03:27.495
So I immediately began to think there's only one place for me and that's Texas A&M, wherever it is.

03:28.100 --> 03:35.711
Then after that freshman year we moved 26 miles up the road to Senton, Texas and I was a Senton pirate for one year.

03:36.472 --> 03:52.013
My father by this time had become a deputy sheriff and they promoted him to the chief deputy sheriff of San Patricio County under Sheriff Tomlinson and he wanted Dad closer so we moved up to the county seat at Senton.

03:55.038 --> 03:56.740
Dad ran for sheriff

03:58.913 --> 04:03.999
the following year and was defeated and it upset him terribly.

04:05.441 --> 04:23.301
He would not pay the Padron for the 250 block votes that they promised him if he would just shell over the cash and my dad was an honest man and that was one of

04:24.817 --> 04:29.903
my good fortunes was having a good honest Christian mother and father.

04:30.824 --> 04:46.823
Anyway dad lost the race and he was very unhappy at that point in time in his life and his older brother in Dallas called him and said come to Dallas I want to hire you to work in my wholesale hardware business.

04:49.065 --> 04:52.950
And on Sunday September

04:53.774 --> 05:00.521
The 11th, 1948, we moved to Dallas.

05:02.202 --> 05:19.900
And the next day, I started to school at Woodrow Wilson High School, a three-year school, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades with 1,300 students, coming from Sinton with 150 in four grades.

05:21.301 --> 05:23.123
I was a country boy in the big town.

05:24.065 --> 05:27.408
and very unhappy, very, very unhappy.

05:28.789 --> 05:39.239
I had played all of the sports as a freshman and sophomore, and I refused to participate in anything except go to school.

05:43.003 --> 05:53.953
Fortunately for me, as is the case anywhere in the United States, there are good people who came to my rescue and aid in the form of

05:54.305 --> 06:03.697
Kids of my age met primarily in the church, Lakewood Methodist Church, that we became members of.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.043
And they quickly became fast friends.

06:08.304 --> 06:12.910
I never thought that you could have good friends in a big city from what I'd been told about them.

06:14.171 --> 06:18.497
I've subsequently learned that they even grow good people in New York City.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.202
My daughter lives there now, one of them.

06:23.903 --> 06:29.530
Anyways, I went through my junior year without participating in any extracurricular activities.

06:30.170 --> 06:42.365
Fortunately again for me, Woodrow Wilson had an ROTC program and I became a part of that and for two years I took ROTC and got a basic understanding of what the military was all about and liked it.

06:45.248 --> 06:47.490
Senior year I went out for football and track.

06:48.612 --> 06:53.117
I certainly didn't distinguish myself but I played football as a

06:54.042 --> 06:56.945
My head coach was named Jim Riley.

06:57.045 --> 07:00.830
Head coach was named Jungle Jim Riley, a great fellow.

07:02.432 --> 07:03.633
Coach Riley was a good man.

07:05.295 --> 07:20.252
One thing that stands out in my memory from my senior year on the track team, we had a good mile relay team.

07:21.498 --> 07:35.238
You may know Sam Blair, longtime reporter for the Dallas Morning News, and he's written a number of books, I don't know, a dozen by now probably, and one on A&M.

07:35.258 --> 07:37.762
I've got several copies of it over there in my bookshelf.

07:38.563 --> 07:48.518
Sam was a member of the team and myself, and the anchorman was a kid named Jack Dunlap,

07:49.477 --> 07:51.320
We called him one lap done lap.

07:51.380 --> 07:57.749
That was all he was good for, but he was good for a good closing lap on that mile relay.

07:58.070 --> 08:00.073
And we won the Dallas City Championship.

08:02.797 --> 08:05.561
But that wasn't the most memorable event.

08:05.661 --> 08:14.554
We then went to stage meet in Houston and stayed in the brand new Shamrock Hotel.

08:14.734 --> 08:15.255
Wow.

08:17.238 --> 08:18.640
A big deal.

08:20.003 --> 08:25.388
I'll never forget being very responsible and conscientious.

08:26.049 --> 08:33.116
I went to bed early that night, unlike many of my teammates who went to see the big city.

08:34.998 --> 08:41.764
And I developed out of anxiety, I'm sure, the worst headache I've ever had in my life.

08:42.785 --> 08:43.866
And I couldn't go to sleep.

08:44.287 --> 08:47.270
And at 4 o'clock in the morning, I finally said, I've got to do something.

08:47.310 --> 08:48.711
My head is going to split wide open.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.523
I got up, got my clothes on, went downstairs and found Bell Boy.

08:53.183 --> 08:55.525
And I said, listen, I've got to have some aspirin.

08:56.606 --> 08:59.729
I'll even give you a dollar if you'll just get me two.

09:00.509 --> 09:03.512
Now a dollar was big stuff in 1950.

09:06.294 --> 09:08.997
And he promptly showed up with two aspirin and I took them.

09:09.037 --> 09:10.938
So I got about two hours sleep that night.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.603
And that was about two hours more than one lap Dunlap got.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.765
I think he stayed out.

09:18.880 --> 09:22.024
and drank all night long.

09:25.929 --> 09:34.019
And at the track, he was dry heaving as he got there.

09:34.039 --> 09:41.529
And oh my goodness, Coach Jamison was the track coach and I'll never forget.

09:41.549 --> 09:43.251
He was so disturbed about

09:44.733 --> 09:49.097
Jack Dunlap, but anyway, he said, you're gonna run if it kills you.

09:50.919 --> 10:05.634
We ran, but needless to say, we were the last one in our heat and that was the end of our state meet and Jack threw up right before and right after his 440 lap.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.503
That finished off my senior year.

10:15.732 --> 10:19.876
and I was looking forward anxiously to going to A&M.

10:20.977 --> 10:21.738
I didn't know how.

10:22.278 --> 10:23.359
Had you visited yet?

10:23.880 --> 10:28.424
I have never set foot on the campus yet, but the dream is all in my head.

10:30.086 --> 10:42.718
And so at some time down about graduation and before I went to work for that summer, Dad sat down to talk to me

10:44.673 --> 10:54.167
He said, Charles, I know you want to go to A&M, but SMU is only three miles down the road from where we live.

10:55.609 --> 10:58.153
And rent is free, and your food is free.

10:59.094 --> 11:03.200
He said, you could go to SMU, and it's a better school than A&M.

11:03.220 --> 11:11.372
And, of course, this was the time of Doak Walker and Kyle Rote and all of that bunch and all the national...

11:12.432 --> 11:18.200
publicity that they were getting, and SMU was an attractive school, but it wasn't me.

11:19.722 --> 11:28.654
Anyway, being the loyal son, back in those days, it's so different.

11:28.875 --> 11:32.980
I don't have to explain it to you, but you did what your parents wanted you to do.

11:35.364 --> 11:38.608
They supported you, and you supported them, and you were a family, and

11:39.331 --> 11:49.100
My parents were good parents and they wanted me to go to SMU even though even yet money was tied in our family.

11:49.120 --> 12:07.077
I remember that dad was making $500 a month which was not bad but we lived in a new home and there were four of us so there wasn't a whole lot of extra money as you can imagine but anyway I went to SMU for that semester

12:07.715 --> 12:16.006
and signed up for just general studies, not knowing anything about what I wanted to study at SMU.

12:17.268 --> 12:30.386
I remember I studied Spanish and geology and English, and I took ROTC, surprisingly, because I liked ROTC, and they had a unit there at SMU, so I took ROTC that semester in physical education.

12:32.429 --> 12:36.675
Anyway, at Christmas time at the family gathering,

12:39.929 --> 12:41.951
Mom and Dad said they wanted to talk to me.

12:43.213 --> 12:51.221
By the way, my older brother was, had quit high school in his senior year and joined the Marine Corps for four years.

12:52.382 --> 12:58.128
And this was, remember, Korean War started in June of 1950.

13:03.494 --> 13:08.940
And here I was in SMU and there he was in the Marine Corps.

13:11.013 --> 13:16.561
Anyway, that's another reason for me to want to study ROTC quite well and learn how to be a soldier properly.

13:18.143 --> 13:28.497
Mom and Dad said, hey, look, we recognize that SMU is not doing you any good and you're not doing SMU any good and you're very unhappy, which was oh so true again.

13:30.240 --> 13:40.294
And they say, said, if you want to go to A&M, fine with us.

13:41.185 --> 13:44.190
You may not have been here in January 1951.

13:44.310 --> 13:45.872
I probably weren't.

13:46.473 --> 13:47.455
No telling where you were.

13:48.436 --> 13:54.286
But January 1951 was one of the worst ice storms that this part of the world has ever seen.

13:54.346 --> 14:01.056
I drove from Dallas by myself in January through that ice storm.

14:01.076 --> 14:03.821
There was about six inches of ice and snow on the road all the way.

14:04.902 --> 14:06.585
It took me all day long.

14:07.055 --> 14:07.876
just to drive here.

14:07.896 --> 14:13.664
I couldn't go over 30 miles an hour, and several times I was heading in the wrong direction, but I was the only fool on the road.

14:15.666 --> 14:21.814
I got down here and set foot on this campus for the first time in January of 1951 to register.

14:21.834 --> 14:26.120
Do you remember any letter?

14:26.280 --> 14:27.802
Did you apply in advance?

14:27.822 --> 14:28.663
Did you write down?

14:28.683 --> 14:31.447
Oh, I didn't make any contact in advance.

14:31.547 --> 14:32.328
I showed up.

14:32.368 --> 14:33.029
Here I am.

14:33.610 --> 14:36.133
I'm going to enroll in this school.

14:36.856 --> 14:41.786
Do you remember where you, what building you walked into to do that?

14:45.994 --> 14:51.866
I went to the agricultural college to start with.

14:51.906 --> 14:57.818
Now where did I go from there to actually?

15:01.207 --> 15:04.031
Registration had already occurred.

15:04.272 --> 15:10.541
This was down in the 20s of January, 20-something, and I was registering late.

15:12.384 --> 15:20.757
So I wound up in the College of Agriculture, where I wanted to be, and I had to be sent from one department to the other to fit into the classes.

15:21.919 --> 15:23.481
Wasn't any problem with numbers.

15:23.561 --> 15:27.467
I mean, you know, there weren't but less than 6,000 here then.

15:31.666 --> 15:38.934
And surprisingly, I wound up living in Hart Hall, the athletic dorm.

15:40.015 --> 15:40.275
Why?

15:40.315 --> 15:51.727
I had a number of friends, but one in particular from Aransas Pass who had been given a scholarship to A&M and some from Dallas.

15:51.747 --> 15:57.994
Berman Gleiser was a tackle at Woodrow that got a scholarship down here.

15:59.307 --> 16:02.151
Hal said, I don't have a roommate, just come over and move in with me.

16:02.231 --> 16:03.573
We didn't even ask anybody.

16:03.873 --> 16:05.375
We just went over and moved in with them.

16:06.697 --> 16:21.316
And I lived in the athletic dorm, participated in the ROTC activities with them and lived there for one semester.

16:22.738 --> 16:29.247
That was the spring semester of 1951 and had a ball until

16:30.408 --> 16:32.450
mid-semester grades came out.

16:35.412 --> 16:45.501
Seventeen-year-old, away from home the first time, wide-eyed and bushy-tailed, but still, you know, responsible.

16:45.521 --> 16:55.810
Because when I got my grade report, I said, I am in trouble and I am going to get in high gear or they are going to kick me out because that's what they said they were going to do.

16:57.171 --> 16:58.913
And they told me what I had to do

16:59.264 --> 17:02.247
on probation to stay in school.

17:03.229 --> 17:06.893
Do you remember who it was that gave you that advice or counsel?

17:08.535 --> 17:10.297
Was there a particular person that you?

17:13.100 --> 17:15.643
No, it wasn't personal counsel.

17:16.444 --> 17:19.067
It was in the form of a letter with my grades.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.048
Oh, okay.

17:20.068 --> 17:20.388
So.

17:20.408 --> 17:23.652
That if I didn't make

17:25.606 --> 17:28.790
A certain GPA, and I don't remember what they said.

17:28.970 --> 17:33.436
I would be dismissed from the college, certainly still a college.

17:34.898 --> 17:37.281
But I buckled up.

17:37.902 --> 17:38.703
But I'll say this.

17:40.686 --> 17:49.597
I flunked freshman chemistry, a four-hour course, as you well remember.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.402
And I made 14 hours.

17:53.922 --> 17:55.424
Flunked those fours, taken 18.

17:55.444 --> 17:57.387
That was the average load in those days.

17:57.968 --> 18:02.334
I made 14 hours and 15 grade points that first semester.

18:02.895 --> 18:07.943
But in those days, an A was a three.

18:08.323 --> 18:08.724
Correct.

18:08.784 --> 18:11.047
So you had a two point by today's standards.

18:11.067 --> 18:11.428
Correct.

18:11.928 --> 18:12.169
Yes.

18:13.571 --> 18:15.834
And they let me stay.

18:17.256 --> 18:21.803
And I could see that,

18:22.492 --> 18:28.539
Living in the athletic dorm was detrimental to my academic success.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.564
There was an awful lot of nonsense that went on over there.

18:32.805 --> 18:36.209
I mean, that was the name of their game, nonsense.

18:36.269 --> 18:37.250
Describe some of it.

18:38.091 --> 18:39.092
Oh, my guess.

18:39.112 --> 18:46.241
Well, I never forget things like Bobby Jack Price, who was a sophomore.

18:47.642 --> 18:48.904
Big tackle about.

18:49.222 --> 19:00.319
for those days, about 6'4 and about 2.30, and he liked to wield the broom, and I'm telling you, when they used the broom on you, there was no handle left when it got through.

19:00.339 --> 19:05.126
The first lick, the handle was gone, and then they beat you with what was left, and I mean beat you.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.663
Guys coming in in the middle of the night,

19:20.508 --> 19:23.311
So and so, I'm gonna get you.

19:26.353 --> 19:28.095
You better barricade that.

19:30.757 --> 19:33.279
Did you all do anything in retaliation sometimes?

19:33.460 --> 19:33.860
Oh, yes.

19:35.521 --> 19:40.846
I got the sweetest revenge of my life, but this came years later.

19:41.687 --> 19:44.990
Bobby Dixon was a big tackle on the football team in those days.

19:45.570 --> 19:48.473
He was a senior when I was, after I had gone back,

19:49.347 --> 19:51.451
to the athletic dorm, Hart Hall.

19:51.751 --> 19:54.576
He was a senior and Bobby was a big drinker.

19:55.077 --> 20:00.185
In fact, Bobby was, how do I say this?

20:00.987 --> 20:09.100
Bobby influenced me by his peer pressure.

20:10.322 --> 20:14.950
At the end of my sophomore year, we were headed for the Shamrock Hotel again

20:15.200 --> 20:23.982
for the athletic, for the football banquet where we give the awards out and the letters and whatever.

20:25.025 --> 20:31.200
I'd never had a drink of alcohol in my life and I'd finished my sophomore year

20:32.868 --> 20:40.816
And we went down Highway 6 to go to Houston and stopped just outside of town somewhere that maybe is in the next county.

20:40.836 --> 20:42.238
I think it's still dry here.

20:42.418 --> 20:44.480
You know, he had to go across Whiskey Bridge.

20:44.981 --> 20:47.343
I guess it was down toward Navasota, Grimes County.

20:47.423 --> 20:52.349
He stopped and got a case of beer, a case.

20:52.369 --> 20:56.853
And Bobby's a big guy and he can handle about two-thirds of a case by himself.

20:58.015 --> 21:00.017
But he kept heckling me.

21:00.137 --> 21:01.238
I was sitting in the back seat.

21:01.707 --> 21:09.398
heckling me about, you know, I was a wimp and I couldn't, couldn't drink a beer even if I wanted to, you know, you know.

21:10.319 --> 21:13.724
And finally I said, Bobby, give me a beer and I'll show you.

21:13.764 --> 21:17.669
I can remember to this day, it was one of those foul tasting slits.

21:17.829 --> 21:20.152
I hated the taste of it, hated it.

21:22.716 --> 21:29.385
I took it, popped it, and I just swizzled the whole 12 ounces.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.940
just to show him that I could do it.

21:34.264 --> 21:50.285
And surprisingly to everyone, and about, of course he was trying to get me to rank another one immediately and I wouldn't do it, but in about five minutes, I learned what beer does to me.

21:51.347 --> 21:52.909
I started giggling.

21:53.311 --> 21:58.517
Everything that I saw and everything that anybody said was funny.

21:59.398 --> 22:05.665
And we wound up laughing all the way to Houston.

22:05.685 --> 22:06.807
Just over one beer.

22:07.167 --> 22:14.776
And then the closer we got to Shamrock, I got to worry about, gee, where do you suppose I'll sit at this banquet?

22:15.477 --> 22:21.664
And who's going to be smelling my breath?

22:23.247 --> 22:40.466
And sure enough, right where you're sitting and in a table a little narrower than this one, big long hotel banquet tables lined up one another in a big T-shape, Gil Stonkey, my backfield coach, was sitting right in front of me.

22:40.486 --> 22:42.370
And I'm sitting there.

22:42.653 --> 22:47.401
breathe it somewhere except across the table.

22:48.162 --> 22:57.097
But if the truth were known, I'll bet you his breast talked worse than mine did.

22:57.117 --> 23:03.508
Now, for you as a, let's say, would you, were you called a frog?

23:03.768 --> 23:03.968
Oh, yes.

23:03.989 --> 23:05.411
Transferred after one semester?

23:06.092 --> 23:07.294
I was called a frog.

23:07.915 --> 23:16.624
just that one semester, and that's the lowest thing on earth, as you know, and they said it with just such harsh tones in their voice.

23:16.644 --> 23:18.906
And being a frog was worse than being a fish, wasn't it?

23:18.926 --> 23:19.567
Absolutely.

23:20.187 --> 23:21.048
Oh, absolutely.

23:21.068 --> 23:23.050
That's the lowest thing on campus was a frog.

23:23.831 --> 23:28.596
Now, and the fact that you had frogged in from SMU, was that also?

23:29.277 --> 23:35.423
Well, there was nothing worse except if I came from west of here.

23:35.443 --> 23:35.543
Okay.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.587
for football?

23:40.787 --> 23:41.148
Yes, sir.

23:42.329 --> 23:45.473
I went out for spring training in the spring of 52.

23:45.874 --> 23:46.535
Describe that.

23:47.195 --> 24:01.754
Well, I'll start by saying that Ray George was the kindest, most, I just have to say, wonderful gentleman that I've ever known in athletics.

24:02.315 --> 24:03.517
Was this his first year?

24:03.797 --> 24:06.120
No, it was Ray George's

24:10.387 --> 24:11.749
Second or third year.

24:11.989 --> 24:13.872
And he followed Coach Norton, didn't he?

24:14.914 --> 24:17.157
No, he followed Harry Steitler.

24:17.357 --> 24:17.878
Oh, that's right.

24:17.898 --> 24:18.279
That's right.

24:18.299 --> 24:18.760
That's right.

24:18.780 --> 24:22.044
Harry Steitler got himself in trouble with, you know.

24:22.165 --> 24:24.168
Yeah.

24:24.188 --> 24:25.069
He followed Steitler.

24:26.211 --> 24:28.374
And I loved him.

24:29.275 --> 24:33.221
He was a big, jolly giant, you know, an ex-pro lineman.

24:35.344 --> 24:37.187
Maybe he wasn't the best coach in the world, but

24:37.808 --> 24:39.954
He was sure a good role model for kids.

24:41.077 --> 24:42.220
I love him to this very day.

24:43.322 --> 24:49.579
Coach Michalski was also an ex NFL lineman who was a line coach and we all loved him as well.

24:50.341 --> 24:53.910
And I went out in the spring of 1952 and

24:55.021 --> 24:57.705
Caught the coach's eye because I'm, you know, a real hard worker.

24:57.745 --> 25:00.569
I don't have much talent, but I give it everything I've got.

25:01.551 --> 25:07.039
And he told me during spring training, if I did well at the beginning of the fall, he'd give me a scholarship.

25:08.021 --> 25:19.358
And long and short of that was, gave me a scholarship, which was sorely needed.

25:22.358 --> 25:25.841
90 cents a day for their OOTC contract the last two years.

25:25.881 --> 25:29.405
Man, I was in tall cotton.

25:29.465 --> 25:30.846
Tall cotton.

25:30.866 --> 25:36.972
But football season of 52, just remembered for two or three things.

25:38.593 --> 25:41.536
I was still really working hard trying to make the team.

25:41.596 --> 25:42.277
I couldn't believe it.

25:42.297 --> 25:52.146
This was far and beyond any dream that I ever had, playing football for the school that I loved dearly.

25:54.404 --> 26:10.687
We went up to play the number one team in the United States, Michigan State, at East Lansing, Michigan that fall in a preseason game, and they were tough.

26:10.707 --> 26:14.412
They already had a bunch of black boys on their team.

26:15.253 --> 26:19.719
I'd never seen a black boy in uniform, but they were good.

26:20.821 --> 26:22.403
We held them pretty good in the first half.

26:22.822 --> 26:25.928
At the beginning, let's see, was it the beginning of the second half?

26:27.551 --> 26:30.216
My memory's not that good, but I believe that's correct.

26:31.999 --> 26:40.955
We came back out on the field and Coach George walked up behind me and said, Charlie, I'm going to start you, second half.

26:42.138 --> 26:45.083
He said, they're kicking off to us, you go in and take the kickoff.

26:47.965 --> 26:51.389
My eyes got big as saucers.

26:51.409 --> 26:57.657
Anyway, they kicked off, and surprisingly, they kicked it right to me, and surprisingly, I caught it.

26:59.599 --> 27:06.428
And I ran up the field like a scared jackrabbit just as fast as I could go, and I thought I was gone.

27:08.110 --> 27:16.420
And those black boys, and they were two of them, came from either side and hit me at the same time.

27:17.632 --> 27:21.636
And I went that way and the ball went that way straight up.

27:21.656 --> 27:26.280
And I fumbled that ball and they recovered it on about our 40-yard line.

27:26.300 --> 27:32.866
And that was the longest trip going back to that bench.

27:35.228 --> 27:36.790
You know how you felt.

27:37.210 --> 27:47.520
And I walked by Coach George and he put his arm around me and said, Charlie, I give you a chance and look what you do.

27:48.682 --> 27:49.623
And he patted me.

27:49.643 --> 27:54.871
And I went over and sat down and I said, I'll never play again this season.

27:58.537 --> 28:02.042
And they really selected us in the second half.

28:02.062 --> 28:06.429
It was 40-something to seven, the final score, which is about what it should have been.

28:09.053 --> 28:15.162
Next week we were getting ready to play the first Southwest Conference

28:15.547 --> 28:33.204
opening game and we were doing calisthenics down and I can still remember the very place on Kyle Field down in the south end we were doing pre-game warm-ups and Coach George walked up behind me and said, Charlie you're going to start today.

28:36.367 --> 28:45.115
So that, that, I got some redemption I had a pretty good game that, I wasn't a star I was just a hard-working player

28:46.192 --> 28:50.576
And we did have two-platoon football that year.

28:50.896 --> 28:57.203
The very next year, they started messing with it and going to, they changed the rules up so bad it was horrible.

28:57.223 --> 29:03.348
But anyway, under two-platoon when I was playing just offense, I enjoyed playing the game that way.

29:03.669 --> 29:06.852
To play 60 minutes a game, you have to be an iron man.

29:06.912 --> 29:14.279
And by the fourth quarter, you know, all you got left is guts to play on.

29:14.819 --> 29:15.540
But anyway.

29:15.858 --> 29:22.806
I had a pretty good season that year in lettered and really got to know the guys well.

29:24.308 --> 29:34.320
One little incident that I want to relay to you, you might remember Jack Little, two-time All-American tackle, 6'4", 234.

29:34.761 --> 29:38.465
I can still see him standing on the scales, weighing in.

29:39.927 --> 29:45.173
A real man among boys, at least among this boy.

29:46.402 --> 30:04.327
And in the very first play of football at A&M in the spring of 52, the very first play, I was playing right halfback on a T formation.

30:04.868 --> 30:09.895
They set me left and my mission was to block Jack Little.

30:11.678 --> 30:15.463
Do you know how I remember that, Haskell?

30:16.844 --> 30:26.079
I remember being a bothersome gnat on his butt and nothing more.

30:27.401 --> 30:32.028
He swatted me off like I was insignificant.

30:32.049 --> 30:35.835
I thought, my God, are all these guys this tough?

30:38.118 --> 30:39.040
He was one man.

30:39.901 --> 30:43.527
In those days, where in the dining halls did y'all eat?

30:45.329 --> 30:49.718
We ate in a corner of Cebiza.

30:49.938 --> 30:50.960
Oh, Cebiza.

30:50.980 --> 30:51.361
Cebiza.

30:51.822 --> 30:55.229
And did you all eat any food that was different from everybody else?

30:55.249 --> 30:55.890
Oh, absolutely.

30:56.031 --> 30:57.894
During football season only.

30:58.335 --> 31:01.902
What kind of, what was the menu in those days?

31:01.942 --> 31:03.726
The menu was usually

31:04.972 --> 31:15.066
lots of meat, steaks, that was the basics, lots of potatoes and whatever you wanted, lots of kush, all of it you wanted.

31:15.146 --> 31:31.688
The thing about it though, when you had a football practice with Coach George, and maybe, maybe this is one of the reasons why he was fired, you could

31:31.887 --> 31:35.738
generally go down to Cebiza and eat a meal after practice.
