00:01.870 --> 00:15.488
Groups that we talked about earlier reacted to 
this cut off of federal funding as far as projects

00:01.870 --> 00:15.488
that they had been relatively assured of getting 
rehab that had been promised and this type of

00:01.870 --> 00:15.488
thing. How are they reacting? How do planners 
react to their different demands that they have

00:17.510 --> 00:23.197
coming in now? Well, the Planning Department of 
the City of Austin is not involved in the Community

00:23.858 --> 00:31.388
Development Program, in the delivery of services 
directly. nor are they involved any longer in the

00:32.262 --> 00:35.846
planning for the use of those funds. That's done 
through the city's human services department.

00:39.710 --> 00:48.779
Federal programs have been centralized in the 
human services department, while overall

00:39.710 --> 00:48.779
comprehensive plans, zoning, and things have 
been in the planning department. The

00:49.920 --> 00:59.130
neighborhood groups most closely affected by the 
cutoff of funds, or not cutoff, but the

00:49.920 --> 00:59.130
withholding of funds, because the funds are still 
available, they're just being held. The

01:00.171 --> 01:02.033
withholding of funds has been affected of groups 
like Texas Acorn, some of the minority

01:02.536 --> 01:13.425
neighborhoods, not well organized, but 
dependent upon these kind of activities to

01:02.536 --> 01:13.425
support the neighborhoods. They have, they have 
expressed great concern. They've repeatedly

01:16.488 --> 01:20.912
made statements and tried to work with city 
officials. And they're as anxious as we are to

01:21.932 --> 01:25.595
resolve it, but we all feel powerless. It's out of 
our hands, there's nothing we can do about it.

01:29.859 --> 01:32.121
During the 1950s when the The federal government 
had a push for building an interstate highway

01:32.455 --> 01:38.865
system of transportation. What planning was 
involved by Austin City in order that areas would

01:39.266 --> 01:48.682
be best served by the interstate system? And how 
were areas impacted in the suburbs in that? Well, I

01:53.785 --> 01:56.589
don't know how planning occurred in Austin. I 
suspect the State Highway Department did it all.

01:59.153 --> 02:02.277
This is their headquarters and this is the State 
Capitol and they're going to take care of it. I can

02:03.619 --> 02:05.201
tell you what the result was. The result was 
Interstate 35 came right through the center of the

02:06.363 --> 02:11.670
heart of the community. It segregated the East 
Austin portion of this community, which was

02:12.331 --> 02:22.746
predominantly minority and poor, from the more 
affluent and business oriented West and Central

02:12.331 --> 02:22.746
Austin. it did in fact sever some 1,500 homes from 
their historical neighborhood

02:23.671 --> 02:41.716
by placing them in the West Austin area when they 
really had living ties to East Austin. These homes

02:41.736 --> 02:47.224
were greatly dilapidated, problems in it. 1956 
the interstate was announced right through The

02:51.734 --> 02:58.965
east side of Austin, accessible to the state 
capital, the University of Texas, was coming

02:51.734 --> 02:58.965
right through the heart of town. Followed within 
ten years was the declaration of the Urban Renewal

02:59.847 --> 03:09.261
District that removed all the housing from the 
west side of the freeway, and so the expansion of

02:59.847 --> 03:09.261
state government. It's been viewed, and I think in 
many respects rightly so, by the East Austinites

03:10.082 --> 03:18.315
as a wall and a barrier that cuts them off from full 
participation in the community. And in fact,

03:22.563 --> 03:25.426
those that were cut off by it have been removed. 
Those who were displaced as a result of interstate

03:27.088 --> 03:42.484
highways in the area and as a result of urban 
renewal programs, how did the planning

03:27.088 --> 03:42.484
department in Austin attempt to accommodate 
their relocating? Planning departments, to my

03:43.965 --> 03:48.370
knowledge, had no role whatsoever. The Urban 
Renewal Agency, created in 1956-57, did all of

03:49.025 --> 03:56.734
that. They used the Federal Relocation Act and 
benefits and all of that, and they did everything.

04:03.922 --> 04:11.691
The city planning department had only one role, 
and that was in the preparation of the urban

04:03.922 --> 04:11.691
renewal plans done by consultants. The planning 
department reviewed them, the planning

04:13.092 --> 04:17.277
commission reviewed them, and the council 
adopted them, and that was it. Obviously there are

04:18.775 --> 04:25.402
a great deal of state projects that have impacted 
the city of Austin. What are some of the more

04:25.422 --> 04:29.065
significant of these within the city? Where do you 
start? Gee, the state has always had the complex

04:32.429 --> 04:38.475
from the early day to the layout of the capitol. 
From 11th Street to Martin Luther King, 19th

04:39.356 --> 04:43.720
Street. Those were not the original names of the 
streets. They were changed several times. Austin

04:50.010 --> 04:53.275
had a very characteristic and something I've seen 
repeated in other cities. The rivers of Texas were

04:54.638 --> 05:00.787
the north-south streets, and the trees of Texas 
were the east-west streets. Those tree names have

05:00.807 --> 05:10.483
been replaced with numbers, though in the center 
city, the rivers still remain. There's just been a

05:11.560 --> 05:18.447
characteristic complete building program based 
on an old, old plan of the expansion of state

05:11.560 --> 05:18.447
government. Some of the greater impact on the city 
of Austin has been that when you look at the

05:19.468 --> 05:40.369
community in light of its total governmental 
impact, it's been said that over 50% of the land

05:19.468 --> 05:40.369
within the community itself is tax exempt, 
therefore creating severe economic constraints

05:19.468 --> 05:40.369
on city government. Actions taken by the state and 
the university, of course, are not subject to

05:41.463 --> 05:48.852
approval by the city of Austin. Street closings 
have occurred, rerouting of traffic has

05:48.872 --> 06:02.509
occurred, significant buildings have been 
constructed, which may or may not fit into the

05:48.872 --> 06:02.509
landscape the community wants to see, but are not 
under the control of the community. There's not

06:03.571 --> 06:05.833
been any friction that I'm aware of, however. 
There's always been a very strong partnership

06:06.775 --> 06:11.200
between the state, the city, and the university 
And though there are inconveniences, I've never

06:12.175 --> 06:19.543
seen outright or been aware of any outright 
conflict between the two or three. Which private

06:20.825 --> 06:25.430
development projects would you say played a major 
role in the city's planning history?

06:31.177 --> 06:36.843
Well, I'd have to have some idea of what time frame. 
If we look from 1975, from my perspective, of

06:41.555 --> 06:42.196
planning. Two recent activities have occurred, 
three now, that I feel will have a long range impact

06:44.639 --> 06:56.232
on this community, much longer than perhaps many 
people are willing to admit. The city has been in an

06:56.292 --> 07:07.005
aggressive downtown redevelopment attitude and 
the goals have expressed the need for a compact

06:56.292 --> 07:07.005
city Yet in the last three years, three very large, 
very significant projects have been located just

07:07.964 --> 07:14.813
south of Town Lake. They are going to begin the high 
impact of existing neighborhoods in that area.

07:22.001 --> 07:33.296
And I foresee a further expansion of the central 
business district south of Town Lake, something

07:22.001 --> 07:33.296
that had never been talked about and really had 
been discouraged in the goals. The Hyatt Regency,

07:34.157 --> 07:37.701
the American Statesman newspaper, and now 
another new hotel will have some very, very long

07:38.120 --> 07:52.900
range and serious effects on land values and 
intrusion in those very close in neighborhoods

07:38.120 --> 07:52.900
that exist on that side of the river.

07:53.140 --> 08:05.697
You mentioned earlier dates and a little bit on the 
methods of review and revision that need to be

07:53.140 --> 08:05.697
undertaken for changing the city's 
comprehensive plan Has the development of the

08:05.963 --> 08:13.470
city's charter itself and the changes in the city 
charter had a significant role in planning in

08:05.963 --> 08:13.470
Austin? They've had a very significant role in the 
operation and the role that the city government

08:15.492 --> 08:23.820
has played. They've not had a significant role 
that I see, in revisions anyway, as far as the

08:23.840 --> 08:32.048
impact of planning. Planning is very strongly 
recognized and provided for in the charter. No one

08:36.305 --> 08:39.228
has ever attempted to do anything other than 
strengthen that. Other revisions have changed

08:39.969 --> 08:43.553
the role of the council and the role of other 
people. Have ordinances dealing with planning

08:44.574 --> 08:50.441
implementation had a significant role in 
changing planning in Austin? Yes, particularly

08:51.563 --> 08:58.971
in regards to subdivision activity as new 
development occurs. New standards based on the

08:59.761 --> 09:15.212
master plan for density, for layout, for street 
facilities, utilities, the development of the

08:59.761 --> 09:15.212
CIP itself all critically affect the shape and the 
level of services this community provides. How

09:15.232 --> 09:20.723
about different controls on height, building 
height that Austin City has tried to employ? How

09:21.530 --> 09:23.493
has this affected planning? In the center city, 
there's been a discussion for some four years

09:23.513 --> 09:32.865
about the establishment of height limit zones to 
protect the view of the capital for those who would

09:23.513 --> 09:32.865
be entering this community. A unanimous proposal 
for the establishment of a height ceiling in

09:34.648 --> 09:45.582
downtown Austin was submitted to the city council 
over two years ago by the planning commission

09:34.648 --> 09:45.582
after long debate. The council tabled it, and it 
has never come up again. and there is still great

09:50.453 --> 09:59.222
consternation from the members of the Planning 
Commission that that is a necessary activity, the

09:50.453 --> 09:59.222
Council has not seen fit to pass it. You mentioned 
that most of your planning experience with Austin

10:01.604 --> 10:06.509
City has been in the recent past. To the best of your 
recollection, though, what individuals and what

10:07.470 --> 10:17.980
organizational changes within the Austin City 
Planning Department, as far as administration

10:07.470 --> 10:17.980
goes, have had a significant impact upon planning 
here. Let's talk maybe about specific department

10:24.052 --> 10:28.216
heads and that. Well, I think certainly Dick Lilly 
has had a tremendous impact on what we'll know this

10:29.097 --> 10:38.205
city to be in future years. The commitment made by 
him and his staff and the Planning Commission and

10:39.346 --> 10:46.532
all of those who saw this need to to involve the 
citizen in the determination of their own future

10:46.816 --> 10:55.408
is something that the city has now embraced and I 
don't think would ever attempt to change. The wide

10:55.829 --> 11:00.896
concern for citizen participation in this city is 
so deep-rooted that it's become part of our

10:55.829 --> 11:00.896
heritage. I think Dick Lilly should be given 
tremendous credit for that as the leader of that

11:01.858 --> 11:09.489
and a strong supporter of it. He also brought, of 
course, the the beginning of organization of

11:12.905 --> 11:19.330
neighborhood groups, which has led, as I said, to 
some 65 groups now being recognized by the city.

11:23.214 --> 11:42.810
In my experience, a hearty commitment towards the 
environment and the protection of the lakes, the

11:23.214 --> 11:42.810
protection of the hill country, brought forth the 
development of the Environmental Resource

11:23.214 --> 11:42.810
Management Department, whose sole function it is 
to look after the environment. While that's

11:43.162 --> 12:00.703
characteristically a planner's role in looking 
at the development of the city, the

11:43.162 --> 12:00.703
sophistication and everything is so great in 
Austin that this city saw fit to create an entire

11:43.162 --> 12:00.703
department whose only role was environmental 
department, environmental management, and one

11:43.162 --> 12:00.703
of the few in the state. Nationally, that is fairly 
unique for a city the size of it. Yes, I believe

12:06.129 --> 12:07.270
that's true. The current director, Dr. Maureen 
McReynolds, came from San Diego where she was

12:07.351 --> 12:12.797
director of environmental resources. That was 
not an uncharacteristic thing in California, but

12:14.329 --> 12:22.040
for Texas, we may still be the only city that has 
that kind of commitment. They work very, very

12:22.060 --> 12:23.462
closely. Their offices are co-located with the 
Planning Department, so there's tremendous

12:23.502 --> 12:28.930
cooperation. Have there been significant 
administrative changes, whether formal or

12:28.950 --> 12:39.426
informal, between the Planning Department, the 
and the city council and the planning staff and the

12:41.549 --> 12:46.334
city manager in Austin? I'd say yes. And I'd say 
that they are formal. When I first arrived in

12:52.540 --> 12:59.667
Austin, the planning department, in accordance 
with the charter, had full control over all

12:52.540 --> 12:59.667
planning activities in the community. They wrote 
the capital improvements program. They provided

13:03.751 --> 13:09.497
for federal distribution, federal planning for 
community development block grants and others.

13:10.456 --> 13:18.928
And over the years since that time, the capital 
improvements program has become part of the city

13:10.456 --> 13:18.928
manager staff and is now reviewed only by the city 
planning department. The federal programs have

13:20.170 --> 13:28.021
been taken away and planning for those programs 
has now been placed into another operational

13:20.170 --> 13:28.021
department, the human services department. 
Issues such as economic development, manpower

13:29.564 --> 13:39.518
and jobs, the programs that I operate for 
rehabilitation and conservation are no longer an

13:39.953 --> 13:42.196
issue for the planning department. They're not 
involved in those. I personally believe they

13:45.061 --> 13:52.832
should totally be involved in them, but the 
current operation is that the planning

13:45.061 --> 13:52.832
department does zoning, subdivision, and master 
plan. That's it. All of the implementation, the

13:55.456 --> 14:03.969
specifics of where the money goes and when to 
accomplish what it goes are done in other

13:55.456 --> 14:03.969
departments now. Those functions that are now 
performed by other departments outside of the

14:03.989 --> 14:08.155
planning department, Have there been 
administrative changes informally whereby

14:08.540 --> 14:26.663
different departments

14:08.540 --> 14:26.663
have incorporated plan implementation 
functions, for example, that are outside of what

14:08.540 --> 14:26.663
originally was intended?

14:29.707 --> 14:35.695
Well, the department, the original organization 
was that the planning department prepared all of

14:29.707 --> 14:35.695
the block ramp plan an application for the 
development and improvement of the community,

14:36.265 --> 14:43.856
and then it was implemented by the city's human 
services department. Now the human services

14:45.278 --> 14:49.644
department does both the planning and 
implementation. The environmental department

14:49.664 --> 14:58.636
reviews and has authority over the city's 
environmental creek and waterways ordinance.

14:58.656 --> 15:04.905
That was never part of the planning department's 
function, but they played a very strong role in

14:58.656 --> 15:04.905
environment up to that point. though they still do 
because it all impacts subdivision.

15:10.707 --> 15:28.755
Informally, until the current time, for the past 
three and a half years, even after planning for

15:10.707 --> 15:28.755
federal programs left the planning department, 
they in fact still were done that way because the

15:10.707 --> 15:28.755
human services department came right back and 
needed help to get the job done. They didn't have

15:28.775 --> 15:31.880
the staff capability to do it. I think they're 
getting away from that now. Is there much of a

15:33.438 --> 15:44.092
struggle or competitiveness between different 
city departments to have more control over plan

15:33.438 --> 15:44.092
implementation functions as a result of that? 
There is between those two departments.

15:49.940 --> 16:03.158
The feeling in the Human Services Department 
having control over some five to six million

15:49.940 --> 16:03.158
dollars a year, pure plan implementation, 
neighborhood conservation, neighborhood

15:49.940 --> 16:03.158
improvement, neighborhood development, very 
strong planning roles. has been that they control

16:04.083 --> 16:09.149
that function and they've acted that way. The 
planning department has lost any authority to

16:09.550 --> 16:15.737
actually get out and implement those kinds of 
plans. And it's become a very highly political

16:15.998 --> 16:18.240
process. And many of the projects that are 
developed now and implemented by the Human

16:18.981 --> 16:31.136
Services Department do not reflect adequate 
planning, nor do they reflect needs of the

16:18.981 --> 16:31.136
community. And they become highly political 
projects that are of, at least in my opinion, very

16:34.610 --> 16:40.859
nebulous benefit.

16:45.566 --> 16:52.757
You have been associated with Austin City 
Planning Department formally for the last while.

16:52.837 --> 16:56.603
What would you say the current status of planning 
is in Austin?

16:59.507 --> 17:01.630
Very active.

17:03.280 --> 17:32.511
the department is moving with the planning 
commission very very methodically and i think

17:03.280 --> 17:32.511
very well organized towards the development of 
comprehensive new zoning ordinance they're

17:03.280 --> 17:32.511
looking at new options for growth management and 
they're looking for new ways of implementing the

17:03.280 --> 17:32.511
issues of the master plan the size of the city the 
developmental corridor aspects and i'd say

17:03.280 --> 17:32.511
they're even they're very very strongly involved 
in major developmental issues for the city. And

17:35.556 --> 17:56.541
you would say that perhaps in contrast to other 
Texas cities where planning is considered an

17:35.556 --> 17:56.541
intervention on private property rights, in 
Austin decisions that are made by planners or

17:35.556 --> 17:56.541
let's say by city council or the planning 
commission are more readily accepted by the

17:35.556 --> 17:56.541
public as a result of a greater deal of input then? 
Yes, yeah. I think The openness and the

17:59.626 --> 18:25.431
involvement of citizens still evolves with the 
complaint of infringement on property rights,

17:59.626 --> 18:25.431
but since it's had such a wide dissemination and 
discussion, which of course takes a long time,

17:59.626 --> 18:25.431
which delays your ability to get new plans going, 
it has characteristically been the strongest

17:59.626 --> 18:25.431
stable factor in the community. There are a 
variety of different types of influences that can

18:27.267 --> 18:38.504
play a role as far as playing in a particular 
community goes. What influence would you say that

18:39.245 --> 18:45.274
political forces and political aspect has had in 
planning in Austin?

18:49.020 --> 18:51.103
Well, I think it's been very significant. In 1976 
when Jeff Frieden was elected mayor, along with

18:55.634 --> 19:24.679
the council, who was deemed to be a liberal group of 
individuals, there was a very strong commitment

18:55.634 --> 19:24.679
toward limited growth, managed growth, not to be 
construed as no growth, but a management of our

18:55.634 --> 19:24.679
environmental resources, a sensible 
development of our community in a way that was

18:55.634 --> 19:24.679
beneficial to everyone who was here, and not to 
create another Houston or Dallas or whatever, not

18:55.634 --> 19:24.679
being derogatory towards them. That council came 
in with a very strong mandate to control, to keep

19:25.773 --> 19:33.060
Austin, Austin. To an extent it was successful, to 
another extent it was not, and I think Jeff

19:33.300 --> 19:40.347
Friedman would be the first to say so. Do you have to 
know offhand approximately what percentage

19:41.008 --> 19:47.214
population increased Austin experienced from 70 
to 80? Yes, in 1970 the population was 250,000.

19:54.916 --> 20:00.245
In 1980, it was 354,000, roughly one-third. 
Historically, that is a larger increase than

20:00.685 --> 20:07.637
would be expected in population. Sure, sure. 
Austin has been a very rapid growth. Now between 76

20:11.002 --> 20:20.518
and 78 during the Freedmen Council, growth 
occurred, but it was not as rapid as it has been the

20:11.002 --> 20:20.518
last two years. nor as rapid as it was from 70 to 75. 
Would you say that religion has been a significant

20:27.077 --> 20:31.923
influence as regards planning in Austin?

20:35.166 --> 20:36.107
No, I don't think so. I would say that the churches 
are organized and do exercise political power in

20:36.187 --> 20:50.522
the community, but I've not seen any activities 
that would attempt to manipulate or influence the

20:36.187 --> 20:50.522
general planning community. How have the various 
ethnic groups within Austin impacted planning

20:51.734 --> 20:58.041
here? Very much. Very much. Particularly the 
Mexican-American community. The growth of that

21:03.547 --> 21:08.833
community has been

21:03.547 --> 21:08.833
very strong. It is an increasing percentage of the 
overall population. You would estimate

21:13.799 --> 21:16.302
approximately what percent? Twenty-seven 
percent of the community. And I think that we can

21:19.814 --> 21:23.158
say that that is growing. Since the early 1970s, 
particularly as you saw the 1976 council, the Jeff

21:25.421 --> 21:43.545
Friedman council, pay more and greater attention 
to the issues of the poor, the minorities, the

21:25.421 --> 21:43.545
impact on the eastern side of the community. I 
think there's been a greater organization,

21:44.186 --> 21:49.433
greater impact, and now, of course, much greater 
investment in fixing up those parts of the

21:50.257 --> 21:52.039
community. So right now they're a very formidable 
force in the community.

21:57.326 --> 22:05.756
Do ethnic groups primarily reside in lower income 
areas in Austin? Can it be typified in that sense,

22:06.236 --> 22:11.443
or is that too broad a generalization? Well, the 
poor areas of the city are predominantly minority

22:12.324 --> 22:16.569
occupied. That doesn't mean that there aren't 
affluent Minority workers live in other parts.

22:21.320 --> 22:28.807
But if you look at the concentration of minorities 
in this community on a map, you are also looking at

22:21.320 --> 22:28.807
the poor areas of the community. And that is 
unusual for any town. No, it's typical of every

22:30.709 --> 22:32.811
country in the world. How has their involvement in 
the planning process, let's say through the

22:33.592 --> 22:38.897
neighborhood groups organization, been? Has it 
been active? Has it been solicited as far as

22:40.758 --> 22:46.504
changes, let's say from major thoroughfares or 
public projects? There have been solicitations,

22:46.923 --> 23:02.768
but they have been characteristically less 
organized and have less of a vocal, they have vocal

22:46.923 --> 23:02.768
people, a cadre of small groups who are very vocal 
in the community and pushing the interest. They

23:03.329 --> 23:09.299
have not been able to have the hundreds of people 
that typically come out of Anglo areas. If you have

23:09.379 --> 23:13.065
a neighborhood issue, every homeowner in the area 
is interested and you can make it. make a

23:13.400 --> 23:15.942
statement, and have everyone in your 
neighborhood there. You can't do that in the

23:16.022 --> 23:18.044
minority areas of the city. You have the 
spokesmen, and by and large, 85%, 95% of the people

23:18.064 --> 23:24.630
won't participate. They will sympathize, but 
they won't get involved. But as a result of their

23:27.753 --> 23:40.825
activities, more and more investment, both 
general tax funds through its city's general

23:27.753 --> 23:40.825
obligation bonds, and almost exclusively the 
federal program. have all been chartered towards

23:41.564 --> 23:47.390
the improvement of those areas and the 
improvement of living conditions in them. Have

23:47.410 --> 23:57.600
activities of the black community in Austin 
significantly impacted planning, or do they

23:47.410 --> 23:57.600
constitute a significant percentage that they 
would have that kind of influence? The black

23:57.620 --> 24:00.483
community in Austin has been decreasing. And 
it's, I don't know if it's philosophical or not,

24:02.224 --> 24:10.913
but we've looked at the history of South Texas 
cities. As we move north, we're the most northern

24:17.057 --> 24:38.380
city, I believe, I can't speak about Houston, but 
coming out of the valley from the Mexican border,

24:17.057 --> 24:38.380
we are probably the most northern city with a 
large, organized Mexican-American community

24:17.057 --> 24:38.380
within it. And that community is growing. looking 
at South Texas, San Antonio, those areas, it has

24:41.639 --> 24:57.173
happened that as the Mexican-American community 
increased, the black community and in some

24:41.639 --> 24:57.173
respects even the Anglo community has decreased. 
We don't see in Austin a decrease in the Anglo

24:58.194 --> 25:09.705
community, but we do see a continual erosion of the 
percentage of the total population that the black

24:58.194 --> 25:09.705
population is. As far as participation as a result 
of employment in the planning department or as a

25:10.715 --> 25:25.313
result of being elected to office, have ethnic 
groups played a significant role in the planning?

25:25.554 --> 25:26.255
Yes, they have. There is both factors. 
Representation on the city council and on

25:29.158 --> 25:36.047
commissions by both black and Mexican-American 
individuals have have focused the needs and funds

25:37.158 --> 25:45.672
for that matter on East Austin and South Austin, 
where the minorities predominantly live.

25:47.535 --> 25:56.129
Employment within the city under the city's 
affirmative action plan has been significant,

25:47.535 --> 25:56.129
and minorities are well represented in many, many 
areas of the city. Not to the level that the plan

25:56.270 --> 26:00.958
would require them to be, but significant 
nonetheless. Has this been a recent factor, or has

26:04.698 --> 26:11.747
this always existed historically in Austin, that 
degree of visibility by ethnic groups? I'd say

26:12.468 --> 26:16.473
it's not more than eight or nine years old. Fairly 
recent. Yes. As an example, the 1924 plan, I

26:19.957 --> 26:33.574
believe,

26:19.957 --> 26:33.574
provided for a separate but equal community, and 
it provided for the segregation of black people in

26:34.735 --> 26:37.239
East Austin specifically. And of course during 
those times segregation was the law of the land,

26:37.399 --> 26:44.810
but yet here was a public document adopted. No one 
of course today supports that, but it was public

26:46.111 --> 26:54.824
policy during those times that separate but equal 
was in fact going to occur in Austin. Lawsuits and

26:55.745 --> 27:00.112
of course everything occurred to that, and East 
Austin is exactly that case. As a result of that

27:00.512 --> 27:04.438
policy and a result of that program we have a 
predominantly minority area of the city which is

27:05.127 --> 27:12.698
run down and needs significant investment to 
bring it back. You mentioned back in 1839 when the

27:12.718 --> 27:22.994
state legislature was looking for a city in which 
to base a capital for taxes. Austin was considered

27:23.574 --> 27:30.705
one of the advantages it had over other areas as far 
as being created as a new city was its central

27:23.574 --> 27:30.705
location. What other geographic factors have 
influenced planning in Austin? The Highland

27:36.920 --> 27:42.086
Lakes and the Colorado River have been an 
extremely important factor. It's provided a

27:42.968 --> 27:46.752
virtually unlimited water supply to this 
community. The hills themselves, the Edwards

27:48.775 --> 27:58.727
Plateau and the Central Texas Hills, the heritage 
of all of Texas, begins in Austin. The hill country

28:02.992 --> 28:07.638
has been the premier residential area of this 
community. It is the thing to which everyone

28:07.878 --> 28:12.924
aspires to live in, and it is the area that is most 
sensitive environmentally. And so you have the

28:12.964 --> 28:21.955
conflict of everyone wants to live in the central 
Texas hills, yet at the same time, it's the area

28:12.964 --> 28:21.955
that can least support that urbanization. That's 
been a very strong characteristic of the

28:22.596 --> 28:31.547
community, trying to determine how much can we 
afford to allow development to occur in those

28:22.596 --> 28:31.547
hills. Realizing that type of desirability, how 
has planning in Austin attempted to alleviate

28:32.540 --> 28:43.036
that kind of conflict? Well, planning in Austin 
has attempted, by virtue of its environmental

28:43.997 --> 29:00.943
basis, to establish growth corridors in the city 
that will channel public investment and private

28:43.997 --> 29:00.943
development into areas of less sensitive 
environmental characteristics. What that has

29:01.430 --> 29:23.013
meant is that the city has adopted a growth 
corridor concept that says the Austin ought to

29:01.430 --> 29:23.013
grow north and south and stay out of the hill 
country, utilize it as a resource for this

29:01.430 --> 29:23.013
community, but limit densities, limit public 
investment so that we do not encourage rapid

29:01.430 --> 29:23.013
urbanization of the area, which supports our 
water supply and all of the other factors. That's

29:24.714 --> 29:27.517
been effective, at least the capital 
improvements program. Subdivision activity and

29:28.418 --> 29:30.120
all has been very strongly related to protecting 
the Hill Country.

29:36.701 --> 29:42.307
What sociological influences would you say have 
affected planning in Austin?

29:46.933 --> 29:59.888
The high level of education as a result of state 
employment and the University of Texas have

29:46.933 --> 29:59.888
brought a very sophisticated and very 
knowledgeable population to Austin. Especially

30:03.671 --> 30:05.093
for a city its size. Especially for a city its size. 
As the state capital and the seat of its largest

30:07.094 --> 30:19.586
university, the city has benefited because of the 
tremendous pool of knowledge and sophistication

30:07.094 --> 30:19.586
that's here. Therefore, the planning activities 
of this community have been much deeper thought

30:19.626 --> 30:29.014
and widely discussed through the university, 
through the state, through all of the thousands

30:30.091 --> 30:37.123
and thousands of people who have tremendous 
academic credentials in various, various forms.

30:37.624 --> 30:40.088
The city has benefited tremendously from that. 
They've had the university's resources, the

30:40.149 --> 30:46.299
state's resources assisting in the development 
of the future of this community. Geologically,

30:47.742 --> 30:55.255
environmentally, organizationally, no area in 
the city has been untouched by that talent pool.

30:58.188 --> 31:07.416
You mentioned earlier that the military has not 
played a particularly important role in planning

30:58.188 --> 31:07.416
in Austin, military projects and that. So we can 
discount that as a major influence on planning

31:08.216 --> 31:12.760
here. Except as most recent, there is a current 
problem involved with the location of the

31:12.780 --> 31:27.773
existing airport and the conflict in the air 
traffic that's occurring between our city

31:12.780 --> 31:27.773
airport and the Bergstrom Air Force Base. That has 
come over the past two years to result in studies

31:28.394 --> 31:35.887
that say the city must build a new airport. And one 
of the options at that time was to suggest a

31:36.367 --> 31:44.361
co-location of the city and the military 
utilizing Bergstrom as a
