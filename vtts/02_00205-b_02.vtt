WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:05.022
from that experience.

00:05.203 --> 00:07.352
I saw what the possibilities were.

00:08.035 --> 00:09.501
I saw that

00:10.088 --> 00:11.810
A woman could be a professor.

00:12.872 --> 00:14.834
I wouldn't have known that up to that point.

00:15.655 --> 00:19.861
And so, and I think that was one of the things that I did for my students.

00:19.881 --> 00:40.028
I think the fact that they saw me in class, that I was able to give them an example, a model of someone who could do an effective job in a career that they had never thought was possible before.

00:40.008 --> 00:48.782
and that maybe that might help them to consider that whatever they wanted to do, you could do if you wanted to do it bad enough.

00:49.743 --> 00:58.978
And if you were willing to put in the kind of time and effort and discipline and so on, that was a great... And I always say, you know, if you couldn't do the work, you wouldn't be here.

00:59.701 --> 01:05.149
I said, you're here because you are qualified to be here.

01:05.770 --> 01:08.874
So that if you don't make it, it's not because you're not qualified.

01:09.395 --> 01:18.047
It's because you aren't exercising the necessary discipline and organization and an interest.

01:19.023 --> 01:24.091
And so therefore, how you do in this class is really up to you.

01:24.111 --> 01:33.587
I mean, there are only two things that it takes in a classroom out of the three possibilities to have a really great learning experience.

01:34.268 --> 01:41.300
You have good materials, you have a good instructor, and you have good students.

01:41.861 --> 01:42.482
And I'd say,

01:42.783 --> 01:46.431
I know the materials are good, and I know that all of you are good.

01:47.093 --> 01:54.189
I may not qualify, but even so, everything is available for you to have a really great learning experience.

01:54.209 --> 01:55.071
So it's up to you.

01:56.080 --> 02:04.009
And particularly in those earlier days with co-eds, did any co-eds ever come to you with any unusual circumstance?

02:04.029 --> 02:04.950
Yes, yes.

02:05.071 --> 02:06.893
Can you share any of those?

02:06.913 --> 02:09.095
Well, some of them were very confidential.

02:09.516 --> 02:09.856
Okay.

02:09.876 --> 02:14.081
But they were, they were bitter experiences.

02:14.802 --> 02:21.750
And if not being properly listened to about those experiences of being

02:23.519 --> 02:30.833
of being treated like they were the ones who had invited the experience.

02:32.115 --> 02:44.278
And that was one of the most troubling aspects of my being at this institution, of feeling that a number of the women

02:47.600 --> 03:03.465
were not getting the kind of understanding about the experience, the very unhappy experience which they had had.

03:05.504 --> 03:07.226
I was not happy about that.

03:07.626 --> 03:18.219
I also had experiences of women who were in the Corps who had very unhappy experiences and who would come and talk to me about it.

03:18.719 --> 03:24.066
And I would try to help them to know what to do and how to do it.

03:24.987 --> 03:33.857
But there were certain things that they felt that they could not do because of the traditions in the Corps and about the way that they were going to be blackballed

03:33.837 --> 03:38.965
And I regret to say that that still happens.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.710
I regret to say that.

03:42.730 --> 03:46.896
And I was on one of the president's committees to look into that.

03:48.218 --> 03:58.934
And I worked very hard to try to build a leadership program that would look to the situations of discrimination in women.

03:59.315 --> 04:00.857
And I had a

04:02.575 --> 04:07.179
I had a particularly good opportunity to understand what it was all about.

04:07.559 --> 04:17.769
Because one of my graduate students, Judy Luckett, was the head of the American History Department at West Point.

04:19.170 --> 04:20.992
And I was very proud of her.

04:21.992 --> 04:24.014
And she's a full colonel.

04:25.175 --> 04:32.582
And so when I was appointed to this president's committee,

04:32.562 --> 04:58.603
I talked to Judy and I asked her if she could help me how they had worked it out at West Point and what kinds of things that she would suggest to incorporate into a leadership program that would help the Aggies to understand the importance of treating all persons with equality and with respect, etc.

04:58.583 --> 05:03.614
And, you know, traditions are fine when they're really good traditions.

05:04.215 --> 05:10.990
But when the traditions can be hurtful to other human beings, then it's time to discard.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.485
And so I worked very hard at that.

05:15.585 --> 05:16.707
And I did help.

05:17.227 --> 05:20.633
I worked with Manuel Davenport to build a leadership program.

05:20.773 --> 05:24.559
And we did a lot of research and a lot of consulting.

05:24.940 --> 05:29.828
And we looked to the Air University for their programs.

05:29.968 --> 05:36.519
And at that time, I was on the historical advisory to the Secretary of the Navy.

05:36.559 --> 05:39.323
And I had a very good friend who was an admiral who

05:39.303 --> 05:41.367
did all this work in leadership training.

05:41.807 --> 05:46.616
And I consulted with him, and he sent me the videotapes of the way in which he did it.

05:47.377 --> 06:03.184
And we incorporated all of this into a leadership training program here, which I thought if it was really, if it was really done effectively, could perhaps over the long run bring about some change.

06:03.164 --> 06:07.390
But it's not just working at it intellectually.

06:07.690 --> 06:13.939
It has to be demonstrated experientially.

06:13.959 --> 06:31.483
After being away 17 years for me and my wife, and now being back two years, I'm a bit concerned that the Corps has not progressed forward in terms of staying up to date

06:32.493 --> 06:35.478
as well as the rest of the university has.

06:35.498 --> 06:35.839
Is that?

06:36.500 --> 06:36.761
Yeah.

06:37.181 --> 06:38.183
I feel the same way.

06:38.524 --> 06:39.505
I feel the same way.

06:40.487 --> 06:50.345
And I certainly have worked hard at trying to do something about this.

06:50.966 --> 06:54.973
And when I get women in my, and we have had some outstanding

06:55.747 --> 07:09.227
They were first-rate people, and not all of them have had a bad experience, not all of them, so that wouldn't be fair to say, but I'm afraid too many of them.

07:09.487 --> 07:15.996
What about when you first arrived, we had not had many black minority students.

07:16.117 --> 07:16.637
That's right.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.720
We had had minority students of other sort.

07:18.740 --> 07:19.021
Yes.

07:20.283 --> 07:23.948
Did you have any class or?

07:24.518 --> 07:31.971
or hallway minority incidents that you experienced?

07:32.051 --> 07:33.253
Yes, I did.

07:34.295 --> 07:40.425
And this was the very first time that I, the very first years that I was here.

07:41.868 --> 07:47.758
I had an African-American student who enrolled in my East Asian class.

07:48.970 --> 08:03.410
And he was another one of these students who just had the world opened up to him by this exposure to this different culture and this different history and philosophical and religious background, etc.

08:03.831 --> 08:12.183
And so he was another one of these students who used to come to see me after class, talk about the material, ask for more to read, etc.

08:13.184 --> 08:15.788
And he had come from

08:15.768 --> 08:20.653
an all-black high school in Waco.

08:20.673 --> 08:31.225
So when he came here, this was his first exposure to being with white students.

08:33.107 --> 08:40.054
And he used to tell me how difficult it was.

08:42.565 --> 08:54.853
And then he told me something about a terrible experience where they had put this big sign in his dorm which said something like, nigger go home.

08:56.234 --> 09:01.139
and how he came to my office and how deeply hurt he was.

09:02.201 --> 09:05.324
This kid was very bright, very bright.

09:05.664 --> 09:09.809
He was not only bright, but he was a deeply spiritual kid.

09:10.610 --> 09:24.705
And so I remember that one of the things that I did at one point was there's a United Methodist retreat up in Palestine, and there was a spiritual retreat up there.

09:24.685 --> 09:31.757
And I was taking some students up to that retreat, and I invited Giles to go.

09:33.139 --> 09:35.022
And he was just delighted.

09:35.162 --> 09:36.184
He was just thrilled.

09:36.585 --> 09:44.618
And on the way up there, we stopped to eat, and we couldn't eat in a restaurant because he was there.

09:44.598 --> 09:51.772
And I had had that experience earlier on with a very dear black friend at Harvard.

09:52.393 --> 09:58.144
And it had been a new experience for me because I was raised in an area where there were no blacks at all.

09:58.965 --> 10:01.510
And she...

10:01.490 --> 10:07.819
She had been just such a wonderful inspiration to me as a graduate student.

10:08.339 --> 10:21.898
She had been five years or so ahead finishing up a PhD when I was a beginning student, and she had just taken me under her wing and helped me adjust to what was just a terrifying situation for me.

10:21.998 --> 10:29.708
I was, you know, I was just a kid at the time, and I was scared to death of these

10:29.688 --> 10:34.596
Harvard students and Harvard professor and all that kind of thing, but she was just wonderful.

10:34.636 --> 10:40.326
So my view of African Americans was based on that kind of experience.

10:40.346 --> 10:49.502
I thought that all of them came from their fathers were professors at Tuskegee University, and they were all brilliant, et cetera, et cetera.

10:49.702 --> 10:52.987
And so, I mean, this was such a shock to me.

10:53.708 --> 10:58.815
And so we couldn't eat at this restaurant.

10:59.275 --> 11:00.097
What could we do?

11:00.537 --> 11:06.165
And so we stopped in at one of these 7-Elevens, and we brought the makings of lunch.

11:07.046 --> 11:16.840
And we prepared lunch, and we had it in one of those recreation centers on the way up.

11:17.697 --> 11:31.733
It was a tragic experience for me, and most of all for, I mean, to have to know that this young kid who was so bright and so able had to go through that kind of thing.

11:33.675 --> 11:37.840
And so I certainly supported him in every possible way.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.744
He went on to Michigan, University of Michigan, to law school.

11:42.585 --> 11:46.590
And later he came back, and he was assistant attorney general in Texas.

11:47.633 --> 11:57.443
I have all of his letters that he wrote to me, and they're beautiful, beautiful letters.

11:57.463 --> 12:08.334
And I think that he got a good education here, or he never could have made it as he did.

12:08.354 --> 12:16.122
In these three decades here, have you seen progress in

12:16.675 --> 12:17.692
in minority.

12:18.633 --> 12:20.635
attitudes toward minority students here?

12:20.655 --> 12:33.850
Well, you know, in 76, when we had the centennial year, that was another place where I suddenly found out that I was an Aggie.

12:34.250 --> 12:43.681
Dean Hubert called me and he asked me, he said that I had been nominated to run for the, what was it?

12:45.223 --> 12:47.425
We had an academic council.

12:48.569 --> 12:54.816
And he said, I had been nominated to run for the vice chairperson.

12:54.896 --> 13:00.922
The president was the chairperson, but to run for the vice chairperson of the academic council.

13:02.484 --> 13:05.527
And would I do that?

13:05.587 --> 13:06.208
I said, oh.

13:06.969 --> 13:09.652
I said, no, no way I can get elected.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.694
I said, not at this institution.

13:12.194 --> 13:13.716
And I was running against a man.

13:15.130 --> 13:20.435
And he said, well, he said, don't worry about that.

13:21.216 --> 13:23.318
He said, just say you'll accept the nomination.

13:23.378 --> 13:26.661
He said, after all, you probably, he said, you may not get elected.

13:27.261 --> 13:28.943
And I said, well, I was sure of that.

13:30.164 --> 13:35.629
But to run against this man, who was a very prominent man on the faculty.

13:35.649 --> 13:39.733
So I said, OK, I would submit this election.

13:39.813 --> 13:42.235
Well, it turned out I was elected.

13:42.704 --> 13:45.735
So I got to be the academic chairperson.

13:45.775 --> 13:53.322
That was fun, too, because I don't know whether you were on the council at that time, but there were times when they called me Mr. Chairman.

13:54.162 --> 13:59.852
when I was residing without ever thinking about it because that was just the way to do it.

14:01.876 --> 14:03.419
So that was a fun thing.

14:03.920 --> 14:07.346
And outside of those little things, I felt like they were treating me properly.

14:07.386 --> 14:09.129
Well, it was the centennial year.

14:09.770 --> 14:15.040
And so, of course, I had to be the faculty spokesperson for everything.

14:15.020 --> 14:20.989
And Fred McClure was the, I think, president of the MSC at the time.

14:21.010 --> 14:21.430
Student body.

14:21.450 --> 14:22.332
Student body, yeah.

14:22.792 --> 14:26.979
Well, anyway, so I got to know Fred, and that was just so nice.

14:27.199 --> 14:32.908
He was just, and I felt like, you know, he was just so accepted, it seemed.

14:33.249 --> 14:40.200
So that was a happy experience of seeing him and getting to know him and so on.

14:40.180 --> 14:46.149
And all in all, it was very, that whole experience, and I felt like an Aggie.

14:46.389 --> 14:58.127
I mean, when I got up there and talked about the history of A&M, and I was proud to be an Aggie, and I was proud to be a pioneer.

14:58.989 --> 15:09.124
I had led the argument at the administrative level as dean of faculties, persuading Dr. Calhoun and Dr. Williams

15:09.796 --> 15:19.796
that the old academic council, which was all department heads, deans, and up, was too conservative, meaning too hesitant to change anything.

15:19.816 --> 15:19.997
Yeah.

15:21.320 --> 15:28.935
And that, on the other hand, if you did only faculty with no

15:29.945 --> 15:31.867
administrative restraints.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.209
They might be too liberal.

15:33.890 --> 15:38.395
And so my argument was, let's add elected faculty to the council.

15:38.415 --> 15:38.716
That's right.

15:38.736 --> 15:40.338
That's how I got on the council.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.459
And that was what we did.

15:42.340 --> 15:54.295
And I still think that's a pretty good combination if we hadn't stayed with that because you need somebody to throw out some new ideas and occasionally somebody would say, well now we've tried that and here's what went wrong.

15:56.177 --> 15:57.859
Let's see, do you remember

15:58.042 --> 16:03.027
Did any students ever try any eggy good bull on you as a faculty member?

16:03.868 --> 16:05.390
Any jokes, pranks, teasing?

16:10.055 --> 16:15.621
Well, I'll tell you.

16:15.641 --> 16:21.147
I used to use the discussion approach in class, so I would,

16:23.202 --> 16:36.829
I had a phrase that I would say, a student would say something, and I would never, you know, if it was on a controversial topic, as very often there was controversy in the subjects in U.S.

16:36.869 --> 16:40.637
foreign relations, throughout the Cold War, of course, you know,

16:40.617 --> 16:42.879
So you had to be very careful.

16:42.939 --> 16:46.122
I would never let them know what I thought personally.

16:46.743 --> 16:50.166
I would always just really work with the materials.

16:50.306 --> 16:58.374
And I used documentary materials so that I would ask them to illustrate in terms of the documentary materials.

16:59.054 --> 17:01.136
That's what this was all about.

17:01.176 --> 17:07.502
That was what history was all about, was analysis and interpretation and provision of evidence and all that sort of thing.

17:07.482 --> 17:14.208
So I would often say, well, what do you think about that?

17:15.469 --> 17:18.452
And so that got to be kind of a stock phrase.

17:18.792 --> 17:25.438
And the students on the last day of class, they came in, they said they had a present for me.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.240
And I said, fine.

17:27.260 --> 17:35.667
And I opened up the present, and it was a pink T-shirt that said,

17:39.427 --> 17:40.710
So that was really fun.

17:40.730 --> 17:45.562
To me, that's good, Aggie Bowl, because it means, let's see if you agree with me, I think it means acceptance.

17:45.582 --> 17:46.966
Yeah, I think it did.

17:47.427 --> 17:48.289
I think it did.

17:48.570 --> 17:52.239
Well, I never had any question about acceptance.

17:52.740 --> 17:56.389
I mean, I had more male students who would come in

17:56.369 --> 18:00.916
and sit down and tell me all about their problems.

18:01.296 --> 18:09.529
And one of the things I learned was that the men have just as many problems about their love life as the women do.

18:10.230 --> 18:12.173
I heard all about that.

18:12.193 --> 18:25.853
I tried to tell them the way in which they might work things out with their beloveds of the time or the best course of action in certain sort of situations, et cetera.

18:25.833 --> 18:32.700
I watched them cry because they had been rejected by the girls that they thought were the ones for them.

18:33.020 --> 18:36.604
I tell you, I went through it year after year after year.

18:36.624 --> 18:44.592
I have no illusions about the idea that women are the only one that get to feel bad when they're rejected.

18:44.612 --> 18:52.060
Did you ever have, in these three decades, have you ever had any parental

18:52.900 --> 19:01.851
and or administrative and or legislative attempt to intervene in something you were doing or not doing?

19:01.871 --> 19:05.295
Anybody try to ensure that you gave a certain grade to somebody?

19:06.537 --> 19:16.950
Anybody here attempt to tell you, quit teaching this or that, or quit talking about this or that?

19:21.588 --> 19:25.875
I've had a parent occasionally call me up and ask me about a grade.

19:27.738 --> 19:31.123
But I've always been able to explain to them what was based on.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.287
No, but never, never call me.

19:33.327 --> 19:34.409
You never tried to twist your arm?

19:34.449 --> 19:36.652
No, no, no, no.

19:36.692 --> 19:39.597
And you never heard from a legislator or a...

19:39.897 --> 19:45.744
A&M board member or an administrator, so-and-so's in your class, be sure that that student passes or?

19:45.945 --> 19:46.746
No, no.

19:46.926 --> 19:48.228
I never had that experience.

19:48.548 --> 19:53.154
I sometimes felt that there was a little pressure being exerted about football players.

19:54.035 --> 19:57.299
But that pressure was not, it was not explicit.

19:58.060 --> 19:59.722
You know, it was more implicit.

19:59.802 --> 20:01.404
Well, how's so-and-so doing?

20:01.605 --> 20:04.668
And what do you think he might do to do better?

20:05.029 --> 20:06.010
Or that sort of thing.

20:06.431 --> 20:08.233
But, but I.

20:08.551 --> 20:10.381
Is that in recent years or was that in?

20:10.401 --> 20:11.567
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

20:12.311 --> 20:13.316
Jackie Sherrill years.

20:13.396 --> 20:14.140
Jackie Sherrill.

20:14.609 --> 20:17.433
And I did have a run in with Jackie Sherrill.

20:17.453 --> 20:18.695
Not surprised.

20:18.715 --> 20:19.276
You're not?

20:19.396 --> 20:20.397
Not surprised at all.

20:20.417 --> 20:35.018
Well, one of the things that he said at one point, and I was going to resign from the academic council, from the athletic council at the time, he talked about these long-haired liberal arts professors.

20:35.599 --> 20:42.709
And he, I don't know what his political viewpoint, it must have been, you know, to the right of Attila the Hun.

20:42.689 --> 20:46.233
But at any rate, and I was horrified.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.935
And so were some of the other people in the liberal arts.

20:49.296 --> 20:51.598
And Dan Fallon was the dean at the time.

20:52.639 --> 20:58.165
And so I decided that I was not going to stay on the athletic council.

20:58.225 --> 21:01.308
So I called him up and I said I'd like to talk to him.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.190
And I went over and I talked to Jackie Sherrill.

21:03.550 --> 21:10.317
And I said that was so, not only unnecessary, but I said it was just

21:10.297 --> 21:14.766
you alienated the whole liberal arts college faculty.

21:15.487 --> 21:24.925
And I said that was so discriminating and it was so unbecoming of any kind of a model of Texas A&M University.

21:25.165 --> 21:27.630
We may have our shortcomings, it's true.

21:27.610 --> 21:36.299
But we certainly don't like to publicly have them displayed by a person who is in public, in as public a place as you.

21:36.779 --> 21:41.744
And I said, I'm just, I just don't want to have anything more to do with the athletic council.

21:42.705 --> 21:46.829
And so he said, oh, no, he begged me to stay on.

21:46.869 --> 21:54.917
And he made an overt gesture to Dan Fallon, and he invited Dan Fallon to go

21:54.897 --> 22:03.891
on the next airplane flight with the football team, and I suppose he tried to make his amends.

22:05.373 --> 22:09.960
So that, yeah, on that occasion I was not very happy.

22:10.120 --> 22:16.770
And I, when I was on the athletic council and he was our, our,

22:16.750 --> 22:35.637
our coach, I worked very hard to try to see that I was on the Academic Standards Committee in the Athletic Council and I worked very hard to try to see that we were, we began to raise the standards of the academic standards for the football players and that they had better

22:35.617 --> 22:46.188
and that they got to class and that we began to have a better showing of graduating football players and so on.

22:46.808 --> 22:50.612
So, yeah, that was not a very pleasant experience.

22:51.673 --> 22:55.557
What topics have we not touched so far that we should have?

23:00.242 --> 23:03.345
I'm trying to think of things that I have done.

23:05.266 --> 23:07.571
Oh, I'll tell you another story that was really neat.

23:11.178 --> 23:14.646
You know, I have done a lot of service at the national level.

23:14.666 --> 23:19.717
I've served and chaired the State Department Historical Advisory Committee.

23:21.621 --> 23:26.110
I've been a commissioner on the national

23:26.090 --> 23:31.577
what do you call it, historical documentary projects of the National Archives.

23:32.197 --> 23:40.968
And I've been on the historical advisory committee to the Department of the Army, and to the Secretary of the Navy, and to the Defense Department.

23:42.109 --> 23:47.856
And now I'm on the history review panel to the Central Intelligence Agency.

23:47.876 --> 23:53.683
Well, not to the central, to the director of the central, I have to make that clear.

23:53.663 --> 23:56.873
So, a director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

23:57.140 --> 24:09.938
Well, it so happened that they put the fact that I was on the Historic Advisory Committee, the Secretary of the Navy, in the Aggie magazine.

24:09.978 --> 24:14.023
They like to tell things about that anyway.

24:14.744 --> 24:19.771
And so the next thing I knew, I had a letter from one of the Aggies.

24:19.891 --> 24:25.459
He was an Aggie Marine, and he was on a carrier in

24:25.439 --> 24:27.737
the Gulf during the Gulf War.

24:29.692 --> 24:40.082
And so he wrote and he said, Dear Professor Underbricker, I understand that you're on the Navy Advisory Committee, and I just wondered if you might be able to help us.

24:40.862 --> 24:43.004
We're in really very difficult straits.

24:44.205 --> 24:56.897
General Gray, the commander of the Marine Corps, has said that none of us are going to get promoted unless we read these 30 books

24:56.877 --> 25:00.063
in military and diplomatic history.

25:00.564 --> 25:04.572
He said, but we don't have access to any of these books, he said.

25:04.612 --> 25:08.239
Is there any way that you could help us to get them?

25:08.259 --> 25:10.784
Well, what do you do?

25:11.104 --> 25:12.827
And I read the list of the books.

25:13.288 --> 25:17.316
They were all very reputable historical accounts.

25:17.667 --> 25:24.758
And, you know, I had really been responsible for getting military history transferred from the ROTC to the department.

25:24.919 --> 25:30.007
I had done that while I was on the Historical Advisory Committee to the Department of the Army.

25:30.407 --> 25:37.819
So I felt, I mean, I was just so delighted that they were using these as a criteria for promotion.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.642
So what was I going to do?

25:39.622 --> 25:43.749
So I looked at the list and there were a number of the books that I had.

25:44.209 --> 25:49.939
And so I sent a note around to all the members of the department and I asked them if they had copies of those books.

25:50.900 --> 25:56.349
And then I went to the library and I asked them if they had copies of them.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.973
Well, of course they had copies, but they couldn't give them out.

25:59.554 --> 26:03.621
And so then there was an Aggie who ran

26:03.601 --> 26:07.405
this Xeroxing place.

26:07.465 --> 26:08.907
What is it called down here?

26:09.648 --> 26:11.430
Oh.

26:12.491 --> 26:18.618
Anyway, it was a big Xeroxing place where you could get all kinds of things Xeroxed.

26:18.638 --> 26:20.180
He was an Aggie.

26:21.181 --> 26:29.811
So, and so I called him up and I told him about this young man who had written to me.

26:29.791 --> 26:31.253
And he said, oh, I know him.

26:32.194 --> 26:37.521
And he said, oh, we'll Xerox some of these books for you if you can get them.

26:38.102 --> 26:48.355
So we got all these books together between my collection, the department's collection, the libraries letting us Xerox their books.

26:48.395 --> 26:52.440
And then we got the help of the alumni office.

26:53.737 --> 27:05.316
And they, we got them all together and the alumni office packed and sent all of these books out to this carrier and to this.

27:05.336 --> 27:07.920
That was our contribution to the Gulf War.

27:08.080 --> 27:12.387
You may have violated some copyright law in there buying those copies.

27:12.367 --> 27:13.308
I may have.

27:13.608 --> 27:14.249
It's perfect.

27:14.329 --> 27:15.671
I didn't even think about that.

27:16.271 --> 27:24.760
I just thought that, I mean, we were going to further the education of those Marine officers.

27:25.782 --> 27:28.825
A couple of things before we run down.

27:30.347 --> 27:38.155
With, like all of these letters from students and so forth, at some point, I hope that you will consider

27:38.590 --> 27:41.332
of leaving those to the archives here?

27:41.352 --> 27:45.636
I have been giving my papers to the archives.

27:45.736 --> 27:47.578
But I haven't given any of those yet.

27:47.638 --> 27:49.159
But I have kept them.

27:49.179 --> 27:49.900
At some point.

27:49.920 --> 27:50.180
Yes.

27:50.520 --> 27:50.780
Yes.

27:51.161 --> 27:54.784
Because those are things of the sort we don't have much.

27:54.884 --> 27:55.905
That's right.

27:56.485 --> 27:56.986
Let's see.

27:57.586 --> 28:05.193
Let's make believe that somebody were to give you a check for a million dollars now with only one condition.

28:05.933 --> 28:07.855
You have to give it to Texas A&M.

28:08.223 --> 28:13.038
but you decide what use would be made of that million dollars.

28:14.483 --> 28:18.756
What would you have A&M do if you had the capability to give them a million dollars?

28:20.474 --> 28:22.257
Boy, that's a tough question.

28:22.978 --> 28:32.915
And it's a tough question because I'm torn between the library and of building the program in the history department.

28:32.955 --> 28:41.790
There's so many areas where we really need to build our program.

28:48.352 --> 28:49.054
I don't know.

28:49.074 --> 28:51.560
I think it would be a tough call.

28:52.001 --> 28:56.112
But those would be the two places that I'd want to really work.

28:56.132 --> 28:56.613
All right.

28:56.633 --> 28:59.540
For this interview, let's close with this question.

28:59.560 --> 29:03.711
What feelings do you have in your heart about Texas A&M today, now?

29:07.150 --> 29:12.478
Well, I would be, I love Texas A&M.

29:12.819 --> 29:24.217
I mean, and that has so much to do with this big family of Aggies who have stayed in touch with me for so many years.

29:24.297 --> 29:30.306
Do you know that I have students who are writing to me since 1968?

29:31.670 --> 29:43.967
And now their children are coming to my classes because their fathers told them, when you go to, you go in Dr. Underberger's class.

29:46.151 --> 29:52.159
The managing editor, for example, of the newspaper, Eagle,

29:53.101 --> 29:56.568
was his daughter was recently in my class.

29:57.129 --> 30:01.197
She came to me and she said, my father said, I had to take your class.

30:01.818 --> 30:04.042
And I have another student, Amanda Brooks.

30:04.543 --> 30:08.631
Her father is a professor of history now at one of the community colleges.

30:09.533 --> 30:13.600
And she is finishing graduate work now in history.

30:13.661 --> 30:14.923
She was a student here.

30:14.903 --> 30:18.290
And she's trying to get some fellowships to go abroad.

30:19.312 --> 30:20.374
She was in my class.

30:20.575 --> 30:23.862
My father said, I had to come and take your class.

30:23.962 --> 30:27.590
Well, I mean, of course, that sort of dates me, doesn't it?

30:27.610 --> 30:31.778
When I get the children and the brothers and sisters of Aggies.

30:32.139 --> 30:35.967
And they say, you go and take Professor Winterberger's class.

30:35.947 --> 30:44.284
Well, it gives me a feeling that somehow I have made a difference in the lives of these young people.

30:45.005 --> 30:49.234
And, you know, it's like an extended family.

30:50.116 --> 30:51.519
It's like an extended family.

30:51.739 --> 30:57.651
So I can't, just my association with the students has been, I think,

30:57.631 --> 31:15.150
one of the greatest aspects of being here and of having the opportunity to really I think open their hearts and minds to a broader view of life and relationships and

31:15.130 --> 31:27.443
An appreciation, I think, particularly of the liberal arts, because I think that is one of the areas where Texas A&M certainly must expand.

31:28.124 --> 31:44.682
They have got to, of course, recognize that any great university must have at its core a great liberal arts college, and they just need to look around at the great universities to see that that is so.

31:44.662 --> 31:47.736
and to the extent that I've played some part.
