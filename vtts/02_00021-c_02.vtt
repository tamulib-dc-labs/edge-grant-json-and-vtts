00:02.360 --> 00:12.817
Just apply for this executive vice presidency and start asking around about the process and what it would require.

00:13.498 --> 00:19.729
Got my application in and applied and interviewed, but was not selected for the position.

00:19.749 --> 00:28.924
In fact, let's see, it was Greg Hawkins' younger brother, Robert, was selected.

00:30.119 --> 00:33.310
And so, no big deal.

00:33.330 --> 00:36.320
So then I decided, well, my goodness, I want a seat on the council.

00:36.681 --> 00:39.792
Now there's the vacancy for the VP for Cultural Programs.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.906
And so I applied for that and was selected.

00:43.926 --> 00:47.172
And we were having a banner year.

00:48.254 --> 00:55.246
And the individual, there was another executive vice president position that became vacant because the student leader resigned.

00:55.727 --> 00:58.792
It was the executive vice president for marketing and personnel.

00:59.854 --> 01:01.797
So I said, I'm going to apply for it.

01:02.333 --> 01:09.576
I had spent a few months on council and was selected for that.

01:09.596 --> 01:11.382
So I was part of Dennis Davis's.

01:12.426 --> 01:14.773
So you're both on the council and?

01:15.682 --> 01:16.784
and involved in the committee.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.975
So I continued to be involved in some of the other committees.

01:23.698 --> 01:29.310
Really got more involved, a lot more involved with Fall Leadership Conference and planning the Fall Leadership Conference.

01:29.871 --> 01:33.979
So that was really neat and had a wonderful year.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.386
But then I decided

01:37.366 --> 01:38.328
This is it.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.631
I've done marketing and personnel.

01:39.711 --> 01:40.492
I've had fun.

01:40.693 --> 01:43.278
It's time for me to go off the council.

01:43.298 --> 01:55.122
And I happened to be up in the student programs office one day, and Dennis Davis, who was the president, came to me and said, you know, are you going to apply?

01:57.076 --> 01:57.858
for presidency?

01:57.898 --> 01:58.719
I said, no.

01:58.799 --> 01:59.781
And she said, well, why not?

02:01.365 --> 02:04.731
And I said, well, I said, I just hadn't thought about it.

02:04.751 --> 02:10.342
I said, I just, it's wonderful to be EVP, but I just, I don't know why I didn't just think about the presidency.

02:10.363 --> 02:11.625
And I thought, I can't do it.

02:12.010 --> 02:12.911
I just don't want to do it.

02:12.971 --> 02:15.455
And so she said, well, I think you ought to do it.

02:15.555 --> 02:17.698
I think you really ought to think about it.

02:17.718 --> 02:19.720
She said, why don't you get by and visit with Jim Reynolds?

02:20.622 --> 02:24.707
Why don't you get by and visit with some of the other advisors and make up your mind?

02:26.169 --> 02:34.800
Well, the next day, one of the student leaders came by who was involved in the student development area.

02:34.821 --> 02:40.448
And he came to me and said, I'm really interested in being on next year's council.

02:40.428 --> 02:47.343
But I wanted to talk to you because I would expect that you would be a candidate for president.

02:47.503 --> 02:48.566
And I said, well, why?

02:48.746 --> 02:51.973
And he said, well, I just thought you would.

02:52.527 --> 02:57.976
So I thought, well, maybe I ought to think about this council presidency thing.

02:57.996 --> 03:04.708
And I just waited and waited, started asking people, but did not talk to Jim, Jim Reynolds, yet.

03:06.230 --> 03:10.738
Finally, I went in to see Jim and said, Jim, I think I have decided to do this.

03:11.883 --> 03:37.215
well he says to me i think that's absolutely wonderful but i'm disappointed that that you did not come to me you have not come to me sooner to talk about this and i said well jim i just want you to be comfortable that i'm not i don't think i'm i'm not making a fly by night decision i really want to do this now and he said well i understand he said i'm just and i'm also disappointed that you just you were not already thinking about doing this and so

03:37.786 --> 03:39.028
Okay, okay.

03:39.048 --> 03:45.076
We talked about that and talked about generally what his expectations, what he saw as the challenges.

03:45.677 --> 04:00.317
I asked him to be very, to kind of evaluate me, if he could tell me what he saw as my strengths and weaknesses, and they were pretty much on target with what I had

04:00.297 --> 04:07.206
what I had perceived about my strengths and weaknesses, and then it got pretty serious.

04:07.226 --> 04:09.208
So then I decided, okay, I was going to apply.

04:10.009 --> 04:21.343
And knowing that there was a possibility that I wasn't going to get it, and there was another, in fact, one of the other executive vice presidents decided to apply.

04:22.100 --> 04:28.655
He had planned to apply, apparently had made up his mind much sooner than I had.

04:29.317 --> 04:35.451
And so my application, everything came in at the last, it came in before the deadline, but came in last.

04:36.038 --> 05:02.383
he then decided to opt out of the process and don't know why but and so it was I was literally while there was no we were we always tell everybody in the MSC you you're not necessarily competing for against somebody else for the position you're competing against yourself and that that the council still could have decided that they didn't that they were not going to name me president

05:03.899 --> 05:22.482
And I remember after going through my interview, which was a very, it seemed like it lasted all day, but got through the interview process and then the night of the council meeting where they actually present the slate or there was

05:22.850 --> 05:27.455
Of course, they asked the candidates to leave the room, and I was just asked to go and wait in Dennis' office.

05:28.536 --> 05:34.203
And it just seemed like time just slowed up.

05:34.223 --> 05:42.692
It just seemed like it took forever for the council to deliberate and come to some conclusions about my candidacy.

05:42.712 --> 05:51.642
I think there were some people on the council who were not particularly thrilled, and I can't remember

05:53.427 --> 06:01.746
I guess it would have had to have been my years of experience because I had kind of come through the ranks so rapid.

06:02.387 --> 06:04.933
And I think people were asking about that.

06:04.973 --> 06:10.947
I decided at the last minute or decided late to be a candidate.

06:12.023 --> 06:15.407
I think there was a lot of discussion about that.

06:18.051 --> 06:25.641
But it turns out the council did decide to name me president, and it was wonderful.

06:26.782 --> 06:27.764
It was a great year.

06:28.685 --> 06:34.773
As you review that process, do you think you were treated fairly?

06:37.236 --> 06:38.278
I think so.

06:38.298 --> 06:38.758
I really do.

06:38.818 --> 06:41.642
I think, interesting, in spite of

06:42.027 --> 06:48.674
in spite of what happened, I thought the rules of the process prevailed.

06:49.676 --> 06:53.540
And I did not lose faith in the process.

06:54.100 --> 06:59.146
I think people may have tried to alter the process.

07:02.370 --> 07:08.997
But I learned a very valuable lesson in that, that there were a couple people on the council who were critical of

07:09.331 --> 07:13.116
of my leadership in my EVP role.

07:13.736 --> 07:21.887
And so I learned a very good lesson about office politics or corporate politics.

07:23.088 --> 07:30.317
But I don't harbor, never really harbored any feelings, negative feelings about it.

07:30.638 --> 07:34.242
I really viewed it as a learning experience.

07:34.610 --> 07:37.194
And I was determined to grow from that.

07:37.214 --> 07:43.002
I mean, I was determined that I was going to be the best darn president that the Student Center had ever had.

07:43.964 --> 07:50.754
And I think we had a phenomenal year.

07:51.295 --> 07:51.495
All right.

07:51.515 --> 07:54.519
Now, also, my question has the other side of it.

07:55.521 --> 08:00.448
Were you just handed it because you were a minority student?

08:01.441 --> 08:10.134
You know, the battalion made a big issue of me being the first African American.

08:11.416 --> 08:16.223
And I'm proud that it happened.

08:17.625 --> 08:30.064
But I was also determined that if the council had, if by some chance, the council had made the selection based only on my race, they were going to get way more than they bargained for.

08:31.782 --> 08:37.988
And so I just, I was not gonna be an African American president.

08:38.008 --> 08:41.852
I was gonna be the MSC president and that was gonna be it.

08:42.833 --> 08:53.444
And so I was determined that, I was determined to prove that I did, I was selected based on merit.

08:55.166 --> 08:59.410
And I think the way you do that is you just, you bust your butt and do a good job.

09:00.183 --> 09:03.031
What were your primary goals as the year started?

09:03.432 --> 09:04.255
Oh, God.

09:04.275 --> 09:11.135
Well, I thought the relationship between the council and the committees needed some improvements, and so I wanted to see that happen.

09:11.636 --> 09:15.407
I wanted to look at the approval processes throughout the organization

09:15.387 --> 09:29.066
And I wanted to have the committees feel like they were being treated fairly, that they recognized an appropriate role for the council or the governing body.

09:29.967 --> 09:38.539
I also, I made some, one of the big things that the MSC president gets to do is make appointments to standing committees.

09:38.660 --> 09:44.668
And I spent a lot of time working on standing committees, standing committee appointments, because I thought

09:45.458 --> 09:50.027
I thought they lacked diversity.

09:50.047 --> 09:56.961
And I don't mean in terms of ethnicity, I mean largely in terms of thought or experience.

09:57.362 --> 10:04.176
And so I did some pretty radical things like I asked the chair of one of the premier organizations

10:04.156 --> 10:05.740
and that's SCONA.

10:06.101 --> 10:20.258
I asked the chair of SCONA to be a part of what was then, we had a series of study committees and those study committees kind of worked with what I would call problem committees.

10:20.238 --> 10:30.895
looking at fundamental issues about what's the committee's goal, what's the committee's purpose, and how do we structure the committee, how do we get people involved, all those kinds of things.

10:30.915 --> 10:44.676
So I asked some of the individuals who were the stars in the organization based on their committee appointment, based on their chairmanships, their leadership roles as chair, committee chairs, to sit

10:45.247 --> 10:52.057
For instance, I asked the chair of SCONA to be a part of the recreational sports, I mean, the recreational studies committee.

10:52.618 --> 10:58.105
So she would work with those committees because I thought that those committees could gain from her leadership.

10:58.386 --> 11:11.985
So I wanted to not just put people in very typical roles, you know, all of the, where the chair of SCONA and the chair of Wiley got to be, got to sit in on, you know, be primary committees.

11:12.466 --> 11:14.629
I gave them committees that nobody was excited about.

11:15.115 --> 11:18.221
because I thought they could bring something to the table.

11:18.241 --> 11:20.204
But I talked to them about what those expectations were.

11:20.745 --> 11:33.468
I want every committee to run as smoothly and be as strong as SCONA, and so other committees need to hear from your experience and gain from your experience.

11:33.548 --> 11:36.073
So we did that, and I think it worked well.

11:36.093 --> 11:39.098
So that was a big deal for me to do that.

11:39.078 --> 11:46.579
I also knew that I thought we had some problem committees and I thought we needed to do something about them.

11:46.599 --> 11:49.307
We didn't need to keep them on.

11:49.788 --> 11:54.100
We needed to either keep them on or put some resources in place to move them along.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.764
and to be very critical in our thinking about that.

11:57.305 --> 12:00.290
I was also very concerned with our budget deficit.

12:00.791 --> 12:09.726
We kept running budget deficits in our concerts with Town Hall and our Broadway series, which began to compete

12:09.706 --> 12:12.569
very much so with Opus.

12:12.589 --> 12:20.918
And so I wanted to do something about that because they were becoming a huge drain on the organization financially.

12:20.938 --> 12:24.542
And so we ended up doing those.

12:24.582 --> 12:27.105
We ended up eliminating some committees.

12:27.165 --> 12:33.672
We ended up reducing, in fact, we eliminated the town hall series

12:33.652 --> 12:58.950
uh we moved the town hall series from the broadway series from town hall to opus and now that's why opus opus season looks a lot different than it did uh back then uh but but we've and then we started using promoters to do concerts uh uh and and i think it i think it really worked worked wonderfully so it was it was a pretty positive year of the uh in your year

12:59.605 --> 13:03.711
Which were the outstanding committee's activities?

13:05.093 --> 13:05.454
Gosh.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.159
You mentioned SCONA as being part of that.

13:09.179 --> 13:09.820
Yeah, SCONA was one.

13:10.161 --> 13:11.523
Wiley was one.

13:12.825 --> 13:18.433
We also put in place what was the beginning of the Jordan Institute for International Awareness.

13:20.256 --> 13:26.706
Mrs. Jordan was very generous in supporting, wanting to support an international program committee.

13:26.726 --> 13:28.228
Now, we had an international committee

13:28.664 --> 13:44.597
But we also had, but the committee was kind of very young and without some purpose, but we were also beginning to compete with the International Student Association for members.

13:45.185 --> 14:06.400
What we decided was to call on those folks, organize a study committee, and I asked Michelle Mobley, who had spent a great deal of time chairing Opus, who really developed a relationship with her father as dean of the College of Business, Bill Mobley,

14:06.380 --> 14:13.831
who I knew had a great deal of appreciation for international issues, international programs.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.799
And Michelle shared that.

14:16.133 --> 14:38.512
that same love for internationalism and ask her to chair the study committee that basically ended up recommending to the council that we take the Jordan Institute Committee, merge it with International Programs Committee, create a huge program, and it's worked wonderfully.

14:38.532 --> 14:39.493
So that was pretty neat.

14:40.014 --> 14:43.577
What were the most frustrating groups to have to work with?

14:43.717 --> 14:45.178
Let's see.

14:48.955 --> 14:53.222
They turned out to be not so frustrating for me.

14:53.742 --> 14:59.030
One, I was really concerned about COMAC, which is the Committee for the Awareness of the Mexican-American Culture.

15:01.054 --> 15:09.747
There was not a lot of student involvement in it, but I thought it was a very important committee, and so we spent a great little time trying to study it.

15:10.788 --> 15:15.756
We had an MSC recreation committee that just kind of went

15:17.052 --> 15:20.696
went belly up that students just kind of didn't want to participate.

15:21.016 --> 15:25.201
Well, Rec Sports, the Rec Sports program was just so huge.

15:26.262 --> 15:29.406
And so we were having trouble finding our niche with that committee.

15:30.227 --> 15:36.073
And we ended up, we did a couple of neat things, but we ended up eliminating that committee.

15:37.435 --> 15:44.983
One committee that I had some problems with was a subcommittee of the hospitality, and that was the pageant, the Miss Texas A&M pageant.

15:45.908 --> 15:56.897
Committee which was again a part of the Hospitality Committee and we just had some very difficult times with there were charges of

15:59.763 --> 16:17.400
unfair and unkind treatment of the contestants, and in fact Miss Texas A&M, and I just learned some not so pleasant things about pageants, particularly the Miss Texas pageant and the way, I think it's a lot better now, but it was,

16:17.380 --> 16:27.375
I don't think it was a very, I think a lot of women may have benefited from it, but I think a lot of women were just hurt, hurt by it.

16:27.475 --> 16:34.485
It was just some very nice, and it was not always just the men that were just terrible about it.

16:34.505 --> 16:37.009
There were some women that bought into this.

16:36.989 --> 16:46.255
And it was always a challenge that our pageant was so heavily governed by the Miss Texas A&M pageant rules.

16:46.356 --> 16:52.433
And in fact, we spent a lot of time thinking about whether we were gonna pull out of it, pull away from Miss Texas pageant, and we eventually did.

16:53.206 --> 16:55.509
But that was a big struggle.

16:55.609 --> 17:02.820
We had staff in the office who were opposed to pageants.

17:04.142 --> 17:08.648
And so they couldn't understand the benefit of it.

17:08.929 --> 17:17.661
And so there was a challenge trying to convince people that there was some benefit in spite of the bad things that had happened that

17:17.641 --> 17:23.510
if we focus on what the purpose of it is and that's the scholarships and just everything else.

17:24.130 --> 17:30.720
And I remember having the big debate about the swimsuit competition and whether we ought to cut it out.

17:30.880 --> 17:41.636
And quite frankly, I think there was enough, we wanted to do it, but our contract with Miss Texas A&M, our contract with the Texas pageant, Miss Texas pageant wouldn't allow us to do it.

17:41.796 --> 17:45.842
We had to do the swimsuit competition.

17:46.463 --> 17:58.614
Did anybody, any group, any person ever come to you during that year, publicly or privately, and say, hey, you, you personally, you're supposed to do more for us than you are?

18:02.317 --> 18:03.919
No, I didn't.

18:04.739 --> 18:15.289
So no minority group, be it African American, Hispanic, female, international, nobody came to you to twist your arm that you specifically ought to,

18:15.893 --> 18:16.974
No, I didn't.

18:17.075 --> 18:41.007
There was one incident where I thought I led the council to disapprove of a program request that one of our standing committees had actually approved, and it was a program that Black Awareness Committee was sponsoring, and they were bringing Kirk Whalum to campus.

18:41.408 --> 18:56.484
I probably, I don't think it was an over action, but I got the feeling that the program approval just fled, I mean, just sped through the process and that there were some very critical things that the group didn't look at.

18:56.904 --> 19:00.388
So I led the effort to kill it at council.

19:01.449 --> 19:07.315
And obviously there was some backlash behind me leading the effort to do that.

19:07.852 --> 19:18.226
But I called the chair of the committee in, and I said to him, and I told him point blank that I was very disappointed in how they had put together the program.

19:18.286 --> 19:19.588
I said, I'm not trying to dictate to you.

19:19.608 --> 19:22.552
And I said, but this is sloppy.

19:22.572 --> 19:24.274
I said, your marketing plan is poor.

19:24.734 --> 19:28.379
I said, you know, I said, you just put it together.

19:28.419 --> 19:30.142
I said, it's not going to work like this.

19:30.162 --> 19:31.644
And I said, I'll tell you what I'll do.

19:32.324 --> 19:34.147
You all go back and plan a program.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.251
Plan a darn good program.

19:38.362 --> 19:40.347
I will all but guarantee you its passage.

19:40.367 --> 19:47.725
I'll call a special meeting of the executive committee of the council and we'll approve the program, but not until you come back with a decent program.

19:48.748 --> 19:54.582
I got the impression that that program was run through

19:55.928 --> 20:08.503
and not scrutinized the way it should have been because Black Awareness Committee did it and my association with the committee, because it was their big program, it was their major program for the year.

20:09.264 --> 20:14.050
I should say, it was their major, their speakers programs were wonderful.

20:14.390 --> 20:19.236
This was the first time Black Awareness was about to do, to bring a major concert here.

20:19.840 --> 20:25.191
I asked the question about why are you not partnering with Town Hall to do the program?

20:25.952 --> 20:28.237
Why are we not co-programming?

20:28.497 --> 20:32.926
And have you all talked to Town Hall about how they have historically done these kinds of programs?

20:33.928 --> 20:36.052
You all are used to doing speaker programs.

20:37.054 --> 20:38.878
You need to talk to the concert people.

20:39.179 --> 20:49.056
And like I said, when the program came back to executive committee, it was one of the nicest proposals or plans that I had seen.

20:50.158 --> 20:57.711
And I just held it up because I thought it was originally because I thought the group just had not done their job.

20:58.484 --> 21:00.567
You mentioned the battalion a while ago.

21:01.629 --> 21:05.275
What were the key pot shots that the battalion took at you during that year?

21:06.017 --> 21:06.718
Over what issues?

21:06.758 --> 21:14.130
Well, as it turns out, the editor of the battalion sat on the council, and I really wanted

21:15.612 --> 21:21.037
I probably didn't want political stuff with this office than the previous presidents.

21:21.298 --> 21:31.407
We had a bad relationship with the battalion, or if it wasn't bad, it was in a different relationship before that year.

21:31.868 --> 21:42.398
And so Kathy Anderson, who also happened to be the first African-American editor of the battalion, Kathy Ann, she's now at the Dallas Morning News.

21:42.418 --> 21:44.260
So the two of you broke precedent.

21:44.580 --> 21:45.501
We did.

21:45.835 --> 21:48.801
We did not know each other until announcements.

21:49.623 --> 21:57.059
And so I went to her and said to her, I need you to be an active participant on the council.

21:57.079 --> 21:58.361
The editor before was not.

21:58.382 --> 22:02.671
And I said, and I know the struggle is, how do you be a good journalist and then be involved in this?

22:02.691 --> 22:05.717
So I said, I'm going to ask you if you want to sign a reporter,

22:06.237 --> 22:10.061
then you assign a reporter, but I need you to be an active council member.

22:10.161 --> 22:13.325
I need to hear your perspective on things.

22:14.526 --> 22:20.673
And so when she got, there was one story that was a bit controversial across campus.

22:21.314 --> 22:31.705
When the MSC political forum committee decided to bring, they had been working on this program, it was an election year,

22:32.478 --> 22:37.665
They wanted to bring the two gubernatorial candidates to campus.

22:38.126 --> 22:44.575
Mark White, who was the sitting governor, and Bill Clements, who was running for office again.

22:45.537 --> 22:49.442
And so they wanted to bring both of them to campus for a debate.

22:49.923 --> 22:51.606
And that's always an aspiration.

22:51.646 --> 22:53.548
Oh, gubernatorial election, let's bring the candidates.

22:53.568 --> 22:58.215
So what happened was the two campaigns could not agree.

22:58.195 --> 23:01.601
that they were going to do a debate here on campus.

23:01.621 --> 23:03.204
They said, if we do a debate, it'll be somewhere else.

23:03.244 --> 23:04.746
It won't be at College Station.

23:05.488 --> 23:07.231
So we said, let's put together two programs.

23:07.751 --> 23:10.316
One, we will bring Mark White.

23:10.336 --> 23:12.780
The other one, we will bring Bill Clements.

23:13.401 --> 23:17.548
Well, it turns out Mark White had a not so pleasant experience, my understanding, at a game.

23:17.588 --> 23:21.435
I think it was at the Cotton Bowl game where he got booed.

23:21.415 --> 23:24.700
And so he was determined not to come to this campus.

23:26.002 --> 23:28.827
So we proceeded to put together the program.

23:29.387 --> 23:38.502
Well, the Bill Clements program turned out to be what we ended up calling the Republican perspective on the future of Texas.

23:38.522 --> 23:40.966
We wanted to do the same program with the Democrats.

23:42.368 --> 23:46.434
We could not get anybody on the Democrat side to respond to it.

23:46.494 --> 23:48.958
So we decided to go with the program.

23:50.305 --> 23:57.292
Then all of a sudden we get a call that then Vice President Bush wants to come and he wants to be a part of the program.

23:58.433 --> 24:01.075
Not only that, Senator Phil Graham wants to be a part of the program.

24:01.996 --> 24:03.437
So we said, okay, we will do this.

24:03.578 --> 24:10.604
And so we said, well, let's quickly get back to the Mark Weiss folks and start talking about what can we do.

24:11.445 --> 24:14.268
We could not get a response, could not get them to move.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.650
They just said no.

24:17.491 --> 24:38.240
But of course, then all the criticism began that the university is cozying up to all the Republicans and when you do things like this, the Aggies, the Republican Aggies got a little out of control and they started labeling at a big Republican campaign rally.

24:39.422 --> 24:41.425
It was not that, it was to be an educational program.

24:41.805 --> 24:44.089
And so we worked long and hard.

24:44.489 --> 24:46.452
Well, Kathy was running a story

24:47.073 --> 24:52.061
about that, and she called me and said, I'm running this story.

24:52.081 --> 24:56.729
I've decided to run the story, but I wanted to give you a heads up that I was running the story.

24:58.151 --> 25:06.725
And you'll probably get called by the reporter to respond, but I did, Bobby, I do believe I owe you that.

25:07.827 --> 25:10.752
And I told her, I said, I understand you've got your job to do.

25:11.322 --> 25:15.188
But I appreciate the fact that you're going to give us an opportunity to respond.

25:15.248 --> 25:29.972
And in fact, I said, once you run the story, I'd appreciate it if you would spend a great deal of time talking to the student leaders about this and not talk to the campaign staffs, because they're going to characterize it as something very different.

25:30.205 --> 25:32.528
And so we took a lot of criticism.

25:32.628 --> 25:40.698
I mean, I got calls from, in fact, I got a call from a reporter, I believe, at the Dallas Morning News.

25:41.199 --> 25:44.844
And so it made quite a few of the Texas papers.

25:44.864 --> 25:52.894
And I got a call from a reporter at the Dallas Morning News and was asked point blank whether, you know, Bill McKenzie, Billy Mac McKenzie, had some influence in the program.

25:52.914 --> 25:57.580
Were you able to say to any questioner,

25:58.100 --> 26:03.050
that we offered the same opportunity to the Democrats.

26:03.070 --> 26:03.911
We were able to say that.

26:04.653 --> 26:14.211
This thing became so big and all of the Republican Aggies from everywhere got involved in this.

26:14.271 --> 26:15.113
This is about 86?

26:15.133 --> 26:19.281
Yes, it would have been 86.

26:21.505 --> 26:22.667
Yeah, 86 or 86.

26:22.848 --> 26:23.329
It may have been.

26:23.429 --> 26:25.994
Yep, it would have been because the election would have been in November.

26:27.116 --> 26:28.840
And it just, it was incredible.

26:29.541 --> 26:35.233
We, of course, you don't turn down an opportunity when the vice president wants to come to campus.

26:35.313 --> 26:37.097
So we thought it was, we thought it was wonderful.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.261
Well, well, then it's hard to,

26:39.916 --> 26:48.687
It was hard then, I think that made it that much harder to try to get a Democratic program or to get Mark White here or others.

26:48.707 --> 26:51.711
Because we said, we'll take surrogates, let's work on surrogates.

26:51.731 --> 26:53.794
And we tried that and that did not work.

26:53.934 --> 26:57.438
But of course, then we had to have a lot of help from Jim.

26:58.780 --> 27:01.283
We had to have a lot of help from the President's office.

27:01.263 --> 27:15.660
because everybody wanted to sit on stage, and we said, I will never forget to tell Billy Mack McKenzie that he can't sit on stage, who was then

27:17.615 --> 27:28.027
He was not board chair then, but it was apparent that if Clements won, he was going to be chair.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.889
University president then was Dr. Vandiver?

27:30.349 --> 27:32.852
University president then was Dr. Vandiver.

27:32.872 --> 27:35.335
And so we got a great deal.

27:35.375 --> 27:40.180
He did let us manage the issue.

27:40.700 --> 27:48.529
And we just kept him informed, and it turned out to be a great program.

27:49.029 --> 28:01.503
I will never forget backstage as Ann Levy, who was chairing political form that year, as she was giving instructions to then Vice President Bush about the program format.

28:01.523 --> 28:07.450
And looking him directly in the eye and saying, this is not a rally.

28:08.257 --> 28:15.365
we want you to talk about what the Republicans will do for Texas.

28:15.385 --> 28:16.867
I mean, she was giving him instructions.

28:17.528 --> 28:21.512
And so, and he did well in his speech.

28:21.532 --> 28:28.580
And at one point, and then he said, they told me that this was not a rally, that I was gonna have to toe the line.

28:29.021 --> 28:31.083
And he said, but I'm sorry, I can't keep doing it.

28:31.864 --> 28:36.930
At that point, at that point, it was okay, but he did, he did,

28:37.214 --> 28:38.637
He did what we wanted him to do.

28:38.717 --> 28:42.967
And I think it was wonderful that he was able to contain himself.

28:43.047 --> 28:45.192
And he did not say anything.

28:45.513 --> 28:49.382
He talked about his, my good friend, Bill Clements.

28:49.422 --> 28:53.772
I think also, if he had gone away that night feeling badly,

28:54.612 --> 28:58.703
that this campus had been rude to him, we might not have a presidential library here.

28:58.863 --> 28:59.324
That's true.

28:59.926 --> 29:05.941
In fact, I'd like to think that that was his first introduction to A&M.

29:06.422 --> 29:08.267
The response in that room

29:08.956 --> 29:10.518
was incredible.

29:11.059 --> 29:17.308
I think we did not allow signs in because we were told people were going to be dropping off signs and all this.

29:17.328 --> 29:24.497
And we talked to all of the organizations, at least on campus, and said, we're not doing that, folks.

29:24.718 --> 29:25.659
We're not going to have any of that.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.341
Everybody's going to pass their metal detectors.

29:27.361 --> 29:28.643
We're going to take up stuff like that.

29:29.324 --> 29:31.487
And so we were prepared.

29:31.467 --> 29:39.498
But the response he got, I think, in that room, because it was a packed house, was just incredible.

29:39.538 --> 29:43.764
And I think that gave him a really good feeling about A&M.

29:43.965 --> 29:53.818
Let me mention on the machine that I attended an event a few years earlier in that where perhaps he spoke on this campus for the first time.

29:54.479 --> 29:57.103
He was a freshman member of Congress.

29:57.472 --> 30:02.719
the first Republican congressman in modern times representing West Houston.

30:03.680 --> 30:12.191
An MSC political forum had a session on what is the difference between a liberal and a conservative.

30:13.693 --> 30:25.268
He and his wife, and I believe the congressman from Houston was Bob Echols anyway, a liberal, long-time incumbent congressman Democrat from East Houston,

30:26.108 --> 30:41.734
And many of the students were astonished that a Democrat and Republican could ride in the same car, that a liberal and a conservative could be pleasant, and their wives would sit near each other and smile at each other.

30:42.695 --> 30:45.319
And that was way back in the 60s.

30:46.642 --> 30:50.007
But on that occasion, things had gone well also.

30:50.358 --> 30:53.802
Let's see, other big events that you were calling?

30:54.183 --> 30:57.266
Let's see, I think that was probably the biggest.

30:57.547 --> 31:07.078
With Wiley Lecture Series that year, we brought to campus former president Carter and Ford.

31:08.460 --> 31:10.702
And you must have been near them.

31:10.723 --> 31:12.805
What were they like as people?

31:15.468 --> 31:21.257
And I found them to be both down to earth.

31:21.518 --> 31:27.447
I found them to be... In fact, I always thought Ford was just a very intelligent man.

31:28.869 --> 31:31.794
As a student, I didn't think Carter was a very intelligent president.

31:32.415 --> 31:37.763
But he, in my opinion, just carried the...
