WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:08.251
visiting with the students, which I guess was 
important to the students, being straight from

00:02.883 --> 00:08.251
practice. So it would relate to them about what 
they intended to do. Because historically, 90% of

00:12.016 --> 00:18.045
our graduates here and throughout the nation have 
gone into practice. And I think try as hard as they

00:18.065 --> 00:22.612
might, that's not going to change a whole lot. I 
hope it doesn't anyway. But I don't know. The

00:26.978 --> 00:31.725
difference in that philosophy I'm sure has come 
out. Do both of you think that it's important for

00:31.975 --> 00:41.528
faculty in the college to have had a practical 
experience in the field? Well, I'd say it's an

00:41.548 --> 00:43.009
advantage. I don't know how important it is, but 
perhaps so. Because the students are pretty quick

00:46.214 --> 00:54.525
to detect if you're telling them a story, 
stringing them along with the book version, or

00:46.214 --> 00:54.525
whether you've been there. Do you find this to be 
true? Well, yeah. I think so.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.235
They respect you for having been there. Yeah. Do 
you think they're better able to sit and wait on the

01:03.076 --> 01:06.619
job? And I think the students are surprisingly 
capable of doing that. They've always been there.

01:13.405 --> 01:17.169
Are most of our faculty, have they had some 
experience and practice?

01:20.733 --> 01:25.337
Well, I've been away from it as long as it takes. I'd 
say most of them, it's a minimal amount of

01:25.357 --> 01:28.560
experience. Typically,

01:28.810 --> 01:37.170
your engineers and certainly your historians 
don't practice anyway, I guess. But academic

01:37.190 --> 01:40.117
people don't really know the real world out there. 
And I think that's kind of interesting The

01:42.547 --> 01:52.800
practice that most of our clinic faculty has had 
has been in an academic environment where they are

01:42.547 --> 01:52.800
associating with specialists instead of seeing a 
general practice. Most of our faculty are coming

01:54.221 --> 01:59.988
from the intern residency program, from clinics. 
It's still a controlled kind of a laboratory

02:00.809 --> 02:06.917
environment. Well, you don't have to deal with the 
economics of it. Yeah, right. And that's a big,

02:10.883 --> 02:13.886
that's a key difference. Yeah. Probably not a plan 
to go into practice. You have to shoot from the hip

02:18.350 --> 02:20.973
more. You don't have all the laboratory 
facilities and diagnostics, sophisticated

02:20.993 --> 02:25.798
instruments. Yeah, diagnostics. That's a good 
point. Yeah, I would think that would be something

02:28.540 --> 02:32.044
that's very different in the environment. I know 
my dad, he was a county agent type and all that. And

02:36.298 --> 02:40.883
then in the implement business, he always talked 
about the sterile environment of academics. They

02:40.903 --> 02:42.084
just didn't know. I think that's important. I 
don't think there's any question about our

02:43.325 --> 02:49.172
faculty now is better qualified to teach than I 
was. Technicians are good. But I think that it has

02:51.855 --> 02:57.441
some problems that we need to be aware of educating 
these kids. I don't know if this is a fair question,

02:57.961 --> 03:00.003
but let me come back. Since both of you have been 
through the same experience, what did you do with

03:00.023 --> 03:04.869
your practice finally? Did you sell it? Did you 
turn over a partner? Was there anything to sell? I

03:12.017 --> 03:22.990
don't need money, but I just... My associate had 
been with me for about nearly four years, I guess,

03:12.017 --> 03:22.990
on a percentage of the... net income. But about 
first of the year, first of 71, I'd made him a 50-50

03:26.415 --> 03:31.922
partner. But I continued to own the real estate, 
just leased him, leased the partnership, the real

03:34.045 --> 03:40.633
estate. And I guess the wisdom of the attorney that 
drew up the papers, he said, any time you get into a

03:42.175 --> 03:52.369
legal arrangement like this, like a partnership, 
that is the time to plan how to dispose of the

03:52.822 --> 03:59.333
partnership. You have good feelings toward each 
other, you're amicable, and you're rationally

03:59.453 --> 04:12.514
discussing things, and you need to plan a way out of 
a partnership when you go into the partnership.

04:13.536 --> 04:18.103
And this served to be, I think, to the advantage of 
both of us, eventually. But when I came up here then

04:18.640 --> 04:37.345
and decided to come and went back and discussed it 
with my partner, we arranged again with an

04:18.640 --> 04:37.345
attorney that if I didn't return to the practice 
within a period of three years, he was to buy the

04:18.640 --> 04:37.345
other half of my practice. And we set out the terms 
and the purchase price and all of that at the time.

04:45.640 --> 04:48.123
Just to say I didn't return in three years. And at 
the time it was a very attractive opportunity for

04:48.243 --> 04:51.747
him. Oh, no doubt, no doubt. He's made a better 
businessman out of a deal than I ever did when I was

04:56.633 --> 05:02.659
in practice. It's been a very lucrative practice 
for him. I don't know whether they've done it more

05:06.204 --> 05:11.850
practice than they did when I was in practice, Give 
me more dollars. Veterinary medicine has

05:14.455 --> 05:20.024
improved the economics of it, for one thing.

05:23.109 --> 05:25.973
It was good for both of us, as it turns out. What did 
you do, Charlie? Well, I had a young man who came

05:27.736 --> 05:34.106
when he graduated, came to work for me, but he 
didn't put in the hour and time required. He went to

05:35.588 --> 05:39.154
work in the regulatory. I remained by myself for 16 
and a half years the rest of the time. I don't think

05:45.686 --> 05:48.750
you can sell even good will. Sometimes you can 
leave good image and move in. But your physical

05:53.995 --> 05:57.899
plant and your actual inventory is about... 
That's what you got. If a guy's very smart, you can

05:57.919 --> 06:03.826
sell him a big deal and make him believe it because 
you got a lot of money made. When I went into

06:04.787 --> 06:06.589
practice, I had no money. I just bought a car and 
that was it. And I would order two bottles of, for

06:09.307 --> 06:15.474
instance, calcium gluconate from Jack Miller, 
another veterinary supplier. They'd put it on the

06:15.494 --> 06:18.017
Greyhound bus and get it in an hour and a half. And 
when I used one, I ordered one more until I built up

06:18.778 --> 06:23.042
the inventory. I rented a building that had a 
14-foot ceiling, was 60 feet wide and about 440

06:23.062 --> 06:33.674
feet long on the main track, Main Street. And 
people weren't used to small animal parks. They

06:35.696 --> 06:36.377
had two quacks in the area there, non-graduate, 
non-licensed, you know, shot givers, and stayed

06:36.762 --> 06:45.695
busy all the time, cleaning cows, pulling calves, 
that sort of thing. And it was, I'd sit there three

06:45.715 --> 06:52.224
days, wouldn't make a call, you know, just a matter 
of trying to weather the storm without a level. A

06:52.244 --> 06:56.771
guy would come in with his wife's dog, and he'd get 
out and stand on the, we were next to the bank. He'd

06:58.173 --> 07:05.183
stand on the street a while, look both ways, if he 
didn't see any of his friends, he'd go out and get

06:58.173 --> 07:05.183
the dog, put it in his coat, and bring it inside, you 
know. And I had one cage, and when I was in Houston, I

07:05.669 --> 07:25.372
had a desire to set up a practice, and I had rented an 
office, and off hours and weekends, I would

07:05.669 --> 07:25.372
operate, you know, kind of a diagnostic skin 
treatment sort of thing there on Harvard, at the

07:05.669 --> 07:25.372
corner of White Oak Drive and Harvard over in the 
Heights. And I moved that cage and that table,

07:26.754 --> 07:33.482
examination table, which had been with the 
surgery table, I moved that with me. And in due

07:33.884 --> 07:43.697
time, we picked up one, so we lost the rent of that 
building and we moved to a corner of a service

07:33.884 --> 07:43.697
station sort of thing. And most of the work was done 
in a field. 90% of it was probably lower down in the

07:47.342 --> 07:51.388
field.

07:55.113 --> 08:00.280
Got enough money together, I bought a place that 
bettered land board and then I sold that a little

08:02.032 --> 08:04.075
ranch type deal and built a clinic. The name of it 
was the Near the Nothing Ranch. It was a brand

08:06.698 --> 08:10.183
registered in Hill County. Had her raise her 
cattle along and built a clinic and that was quite

08:10.203 --> 08:16.452
an improvement. You treat three while you're 
treating one in the country. I guess the best thing

08:19.175 --> 08:28.528
that happened was the advent of the four-wheel 
drive vehicle, which I purchased an old army jeep

08:19.175 --> 08:28.528
and fixed that thing up and then I wore that one out 
in another one. and then got into the pickup, the

08:29.656 --> 08:35.485
kept sort of thing. And when I left, there was, I 
came down here, one of the seniors, graduating

08:35.505 --> 08:45.200
seniors, bought the place, and bought a home. His 
wife knew nothing about their medicines. He had no

08:48.204 --> 08:52.771
help, but eventually he gave the thing up, and I got 
it back. I sold it to him. It was an automobile, so I

08:53.893 --> 08:57.418
had to reclaim it with all your feelings. Then I 
leased the clinic facility and it turned into

08:57.820 --> 09:01.225
something else.

09:04.230 --> 09:08.557
So you basically dissolved the practice and sold 
the facilities and so forth. Well, there's

09:08.577 --> 09:11.722
another veterinarian who lived there in town. He 
also is Dr. Maddox who heads the meat inspection

09:11.782 --> 09:20.115
training school at the feds there in Fort Worth and 
has for about 30 years. Rick started in doing some

09:20.618 --> 09:23.323
practice. He built him a little surgery room, 
whatever, in his backyard and did some small

09:23.343 --> 09:33.580
animal practice and a little large animal 
practice, but he was gone, you know, all day, so it

09:23.343 --> 09:33.580
was a matter of night. That pretty soon got over. 
But there were no veterinarians. There were two

09:37.787 --> 09:39.630
veterinarians in Hillsboro. Dr. Ralph George 
came there just before I came here. And there were

09:44.739 --> 09:46.542
about five in Cleveland. So they sort of sorted the 
area. We got to walk to Hatchie, Dr. Kelly, and Dr.

09:49.288 --> 09:52.993
Wheaton. And I had a 10-mile equidistant to all the 
small towns from Grandview, Taska, Albany, and

09:53.013 --> 10:00.903
Lake Pearl, Cutler. Far down is Whitney and as far 
up is Fort Worth. We got some equine practice out of

10:03.527 --> 10:05.749
Fort Worth. And your business is basically calls. 
Yes, they don't bring them into you. You go. Oh,

10:10.987 --> 10:12.248
yeah, I forgot the clinic. They brought me in. 
Okay, I can get out work. We did with record

10:14.771 --> 10:24.500
outpatient for pregnancy diagnoses That sort of 
thing that man mood a thousand cows 55 bulls in

10:14.771 --> 10:24.500
there from Montana. He got tired the cold weather 
and It was sort of a dormant type branch operation

10:24.520 --> 10:36.913
has been there all the time They had a few sheep when 
this guy came in and images began to change the

10:37.197 --> 11:02.665
charlotte people began to move in the exotics we 
then provided facility for that i availed myself

10:37.197 --> 11:02.665
of the high school kiddos by putting putting a tv in 
the reception room and let them play 42. no card no

10:37.197 --> 11:02.665
whiskey no drinking no beer but let them watch tv 
and play it out and i always had somebody for the

10:37.197 --> 11:02.665
night work at the clinic yeah and uh The night 
watchman checked the thing, and he'd drive in and

11:03.016 --> 11:07.382
shine the lights out there. We had a small paddock 
we kept the potential cavers in, which they looked

11:07.422 --> 11:13.089
like they were going to calve at night. By 4 
o'clock, we'd do a section and be good to go in about

11:13.109 --> 11:17.936
a minute. It worked out real good. I had a daytime 
receptionist, and I had a day man who went with me on

11:20.018 --> 11:25.946
calls and worked in the clinic. Then I had a night 
man, and then I had a Saturday and Sunday person. I

11:29.310 --> 11:30.492
had four late people. And I was doing work. That's 
when I decided. I had two children. They were

11:34.789 --> 11:36.151
asleep when I got home. They were asleep when I left 
in the mornings. So I said, we've got to do

11:38.213 --> 11:41.175
something else, you know. And I decided, well, 
here I've been 30 straight days and nights, no time

11:41.195 --> 11:45.900
off, weekends and all. And about four other people 
are keeping up with what I'm doing. So I decided to

11:50.464 --> 11:52.967
look for something else. And I went to Houston and 
talked with a classmate, Dr. Myatt. His partner

11:56.330 --> 11:57.451
had left. He said, oh, we have a two days a week when 
they're playing together, you have, well, every

12:00.053 --> 12:04.039
other weekend, all that, you know. And I said, 
well, who does emergency calls at night,

12:04.059 --> 12:09.127
fractures and that sort of thing? He said, well, 
Leland's been doing those. And I said, well,

12:11.130 --> 12:12.472
uh-huh. Boyd's fixing to get that. If I want to do 
that, I want to stay home and get all the money. I'm

12:16.478 --> 12:17.980
not going to split. So that's what, and I looked for 
something the other day. That, and I came here to

12:21.245 --> 12:23.428
the university. But you had a single practice, I 
mean, you were the sole... Single person

12:25.845 --> 12:28.468
practice, general practice, we did everything. 
That's not common now, is it? Or is it? Well,

12:30.390 --> 12:37.979
there's too much knowledge and too much specialty 
work, there's too much liability to try to do all

12:30.390 --> 12:37.979
those things by yourself. Yeah. And I don't think, 
those who do it are in East Texas areas like Melvin

12:38.320 --> 12:44.908
Ketchum and somebody like that. Yeah. Small 
communities. It can be done. You can learn, as

12:48.221 --> 12:51.545
Elmer said a while ago, to give you an eyeball 
diagnosis. You don't have to take a computerized

12:51.565 --> 12:59.876
printout sheet with the norms and the actuals and 
go down to the checklist and say, well, it must be

12:51.565 --> 12:59.876
this or this. You can still make a successful 
practice. When you're going over treatment, 70%

13:03.661 --> 13:08.567
are going to get well anyway if you just handle it 
right. And you have to be able to deal with the other

13:09.108 --> 13:12.012
part of it, the necropsies. The thing that amazed 
me when I came here was that I can remember as a

13:12.852 --> 13:30.379
student we had one glass syringe and someone broke 
it so they had to get on a bicycle and come to the

13:12.852 --> 13:30.379
north gate and buy another one and go back and boil 
it in the old sterilizer before we could continue.

13:30.399 --> 13:32.903
When I came here I didn't find it a hell of a lot 
different. They had one instrument cabinet, they

13:33.136 --> 13:41.929
had one surgery pack, and you did surgery on the 
horse, you had to clean it up and autoclave it

13:33.136 --> 13:41.929
before you could do the next procedure. And when I 
made any calls to the dairy for the university or

13:41.949 --> 13:49.241
whatever, I still had my pickup with the cover deal 
on the back and the instruments in it. And I'd just

13:49.761 --> 13:54.228
load the students up and we'd go with my stuff, 
check out stuff out of the pharmacy and go to it. And

13:55.070 --> 14:00.578
then we got a little more money and I prevailed upon 
Dr. Callahan that we need this and we need that. How

14:01.115 --> 14:13.835
would you, again this is really random, what would 
you say would be the high and low points of your

14:01.115 --> 14:13.835
practice when you were practicing? Low point from 
1955-56. We had a drought area up there and I had

14:17.680 --> 14:23.950
clients who were buying and selling cattle and 
horses and and this sort of thing, and those who

14:24.655 --> 14:31.083
were operating on annual loans from the bank, they 
went under. The lots where the cattle had been had

14:32.025 --> 14:37.151
sunflowers six feet tall in them, no cattle. They 
owed me and my workmate, I guess, $12,000 at one

14:37.171 --> 14:41.998
time receivable. I had $156 in the bank at the time I 
paid all these drug bills, and I should have known,

14:42.438 --> 14:47.525
but I didn't. You were out of business, huh? And so, 
you know, we weathered the storm. We paid our

14:50.849 --> 14:51.650
bills. We tightened our belts. 57 it started to 
rain things started to pick up this guy moved in

14:53.765 --> 15:18.827
these animals i bought an electro ejaculator for 
semen evaluation people you know had one or two

14:53.765 --> 15:18.827
bulls and they said well you know you don't get 
bread i'll sell them buy some more cows buy another

14:53.765 --> 15:18.827
bull if they go ahead and when i got the the setup 
with the scope and uh had a deal to go out the the

14:53.765 --> 15:18.827
angus man had 55 bulls and had me test all 55 bulls 
for semen evaluation And these other guys said,

15:19.145 --> 15:23.050
well, hell, I guess old Ashton and Mastin could 
afford to do that. I'll check my one book on it if

15:23.571 --> 15:26.054
there's something wrong. So, you know, things 
started snowballing. Do you think, I remember

15:30.760 --> 15:37.950
that, Joe, I was in the school in Texas in 55, 56, but 
was that pretty pervasive all over the state? You

15:37.970 --> 15:44.859
think that most veterinarians went through that 
same kind of, maybe not in East Texas, but in the

15:37.970 --> 15:44.859
west of it all? No, we did. And I remember that was a 
terrible... My low point, though, came just a

15:47.883 --> 15:52.609
little bit before that, about 1953, I guess. Of 
course, the drought didn't affect us right in the

15:52.850 --> 15:57.737
immediate Rio Grande Valley. Yeah, because 
you've got the water and the irrigation area and

15:57.757 --> 16:00.941
such as that. But the economy was depressed 
because of the drought throughout Texas, and it

16:01.321 --> 16:08.271
affected our practice in that respect. But in 51 I 
took in my first partner. That was two years after

16:11.370 --> 16:12.972
I'd opened. I took in a partner who was a classmate 
of mine and he'd been down in Mexico on the Aftosia

16:12.992 --> 16:23.447
program, the foot and mouth disease program. Been 
about a year down there and he came back up to and

16:27.944 --> 16:30.328
built a clinic. While his clinic was being built, 
he was coming up to West Laco and just spending each

16:30.348 --> 16:40.205
day with me just trying to get his hands back into 
practice, Tom Mosley. And I taught the world and

16:40.225 --> 16:48.579
all of them while we were in class together and 
school together as well as after graduation. And

16:48.619 --> 16:54.188
things were going so well for us at that time that 
even after he got his clinic finished, he

16:48.619 --> 16:54.188
continued to work with me and we might i made a 
partner out of it not in the real estate but yeah 50

16:54.708 --> 17:22.251
50 net income in the practice and that was went on 
for two years i guess he was sitting with a brand new

16:54.708 --> 17:22.251
completed veterinary clinic in harlingen 
commuting back and forth to hardington and

16:54.708 --> 17:22.251
practicing with me but they got so slow and quiet 
that we decided we'd better split up and him make a

17:22.855 --> 17:26.302
run at it and hardly continue to investigate. And 
that was really the low point, I guess, to have to

17:27.304 --> 17:33.135
turn loose a partner that I've known an awful lot 
of. We were just extremely compatible and enjoyed

17:33.155 --> 17:39.107
each other's companionship as well as sharing 
our... But you were just really having trouble

17:39.127 --> 17:41.351
surviving. That's right. It was just... Well, 
that's kind of nature, I guess, of any business,

17:44.945 --> 17:48.289
really, if you think about it. It's not just 
peculiar to veterinary practice or anything. In

17:51.153 --> 18:00.164
fact, then, it was about 1956 that I took in my 
second partner who was with me for nine years at

17:51.153 --> 18:00.164
that time. They built Falcon Dam at the time. They 
were expecting it to take several years for the dam

18:03.168 --> 18:08.835
to be built. But they had one of the hurricanes come 
in that dumped very little water on the coast but

18:11.911 --> 18:34.122
came in up up river and there's water in the 
watershed up the river and san juan river and phil

18:11.911 --> 18:34.122
falcon lake and one rain yeah i mean i think i 
remember that kind of turn the economy of the

18:11.911 --> 18:34.122
valley around when they had the constant water how 
much time did both of you have to spend actually

18:11.911 --> 18:34.122
with business affairs in your practice Managing 
the books. Did you have, did you hire accountants?

18:37.092 --> 18:37.693
How'd you do that? Or did you do it yourself? We had 
no business experience. I didn't before I went in,

18:40.837 --> 18:42.480
you know. I hadn't ever had any money in my life 
anyway, and $100 a month seemed like a hell of a

18:42.500 --> 18:47.928
bunch. Working there in Houston, I was able to get 
some exposure working at the packing house. But we

18:54.841 --> 19:06.097
had a hist account book system, and my wife worked 
at the clinic for the first, in the office for the

18:54.841 --> 19:06.097
first, oh golly, eight years, I think. So she was 
your receptionist, bookkeeper, basically.

19:09.262 --> 19:15.070
Bookkeeper, telephone person, dog baler, cage 
cleaner, and everything. We just did whatever it

19:15.191 --> 19:19.617
had to do to make it go. his account system was one 
that was a commercial thing they put out day by day

19:21.537 --> 19:51.477
thing and of course there was a person who did 
income tax returns we didn't have to worry about

19:21.537 --> 19:51.477
that for five years you know sort of an in-house 
operation again the drug salesman would come by or

19:21.537 --> 19:51.477
the bill reed people from drug out come by and check 
the farmers here ask you what you need did you rely

19:21.537 --> 19:51.477
on them quite a bit for your for your uh information 
on medications etc Yeah, new drugs and flyers,

19:51.608 --> 19:58.917
briefs, prices, volume discounts. You know, if 
you bought so much paid cash, you got 6% off. Just

20:03.403 --> 20:12.935
about the charges while I go, or fees, like Elmo, 
somebody going and borrowing money at the bank at

20:03.403 --> 20:12.935
4% then was a pretty good deal. And they paid $5,000 
or something. I said, look, you know, this

20:15.478 --> 20:18.042
animal's about to die. If I'm going to give you that 
animal back, 4% of the... First, the price is not

20:20.785 --> 20:24.630
too high, but it didn't always amount to that. 
There were other people, I guess I gave away a brick

20:25.111 --> 20:36.285
home at one time by the time I moved here by not 
charging 4-H club members, vocation ag dealers,

20:25.111 --> 20:36.285
that sort of thing, just doing the work for them. 
Usually folks had something in return.

20:42.133 --> 20:43.114
So it was a good thing.

20:45.997 --> 21:02.696
When I went to the Valley to start practice, I think 
this is an indication of the transition that

20:45.997 --> 21:02.696
veterinary medicine made, probably as a result of 
World War II and its effect on the overall economy

20:45.997 --> 21:02.696
as well as on the veterinary profession. I wanted 
to build a building for a veterinary hospital.

21:07.642 --> 21:11.146
That's something that wasn't very frequently 
done at that time. Most veterinary clinics moved

21:12.087 --> 21:14.670
into an abandoned service station. It had an 
excellent location. That's where the traffic

21:19.372 --> 21:20.813
was. It had a lot of water supply, and they had a lot 
of concrete, all that sort of thing. But my dad,

21:27.981 --> 21:34.509
well, he loaned me the money. There was no 
paperwork. I couldn't show that I owed the money

21:36.011 --> 21:39.274
for the lot that I bought. I paid $2,500 for a 
50-foot lot. $50 a book

21:45.110 --> 21:54.680
and $2,500 for the lot where I could borrow money to 
build a building. The lot had to be terrible. Well,

21:57.623 --> 22:05.612
I drew plans for a hospital and I took it to the 
savings and loan and tried to borrow money on it.

22:05.632 --> 22:08.535
They weren't about to loan money for a veterinary 
hospital. And, of course, they had no confidence

22:09.443 --> 22:13.589
in veterinarians. They had nothing to do with the 
building. If I didn't make a go of it, what did the

22:15.792 --> 22:22.482
savings alone do for the veterinary hospital? So 
they sent me back to redraw my plans. I had to draw

22:25.427 --> 22:29.513
plans for a residence. Well, nobody was going to 
believe where I was going to build this hospital.

22:32.337 --> 22:34.320
It was right on the main highway. on a narrow, long, 
50-foot lot.

22:40.277 --> 22:47.517
So I had to renew my plan so it would pass as a 
residence.

22:48.172 --> 22:50.055
But this day and time... Then you got the money. I 
got the money. Ten thousand dollars. And I built

22:53.740 --> 22:58.747
the building and had money left over to buy drug 
stock and a surgery table. That's what I started

22:58.767 --> 23:06.698
with and got three pieces of furniture for a 
reception room. But this day and time and for the

23:06.718 --> 23:13.588
last probably 30 years, you could take your 
license go into a community and go in and borrow

23:14.193 --> 23:21.560
money just on your license to practice or diploma. 
That's good. That's an indication of recognition

23:24.302 --> 23:31.009
of how the profession is recognized by the society 
and the banking community and everybody else. At

23:31.529 --> 23:36.474
one time, was it IRS that considered veterinarian 
the same as plumbers? And bartenders. Plumbers

23:39.257 --> 23:40.858
and bartenders? And

23:41.243 --> 23:48.831
what about your business? How did you operate the 
business side of it? The business side of it? Well,

23:53.116 --> 24:00.164
I had a little bit of exposure to the business 
aspect of veterinary medicine with my uncle when I

23:53.116 --> 24:00.164
was practicing with him. At that time, most 
veterinarians, most graduates did go out and set

24:01.245 --> 24:08.753
up their own practice unless they were going into 
the service. of it anymore, that's a rare thing.

24:13.033 --> 24:20.146
You might have maybe two or three kids out of this 
graduating class that's planning on moving into

24:13.033 --> 24:20.146
their own practice immediately. They've got to go 
through a training period and then go to practice

24:20.166 --> 24:30.505
for a period of at least a year, maybe

24:20.166 --> 24:30.505
two or three. The histocount bookkeeping system 
that Claudia referred to, of course I didn't have

24:30.738 --> 24:42.930
one in practice until 49, and first year I just kept 
it in a notebook, my income. I had an Aggie friend

24:44.051 --> 24:58.264
that was a CPA in the West Licole community, and 
took my books to him, such as they were, and he made

24:44.051 --> 24:58.264
considerable corrections on them for another 
year, and then about that time histocount system

24:44.051 --> 24:58.264
came out, which was I still consider that an 
excellent training for bookkeeping.

25:04.688 --> 25:15.365
It had your daily records of both income and 
expenditures and then a monthly summary sheet and

25:04.688 --> 25:15.365
then the annual summary sheet that just all worked 
out very well. I used that for probably 15 of the

25:15.505 --> 25:24.960
years that I was, 22 years that I was in practice, I 
guess. It's still in use, I guess, isn't it,

25:25.092 --> 25:27.755
Charlie? Except most of them operate on a 
computerized basis. Oh, yeah. I guess I

25:31.539 --> 25:37.346
overlooked one year there that was about the same 
as 5596. Daughter fell off a swing set and broke her

25:37.366 --> 25:39.708
leg. Next week, my wife said she was pregnant, and 
the IRS sent me a notice saying we're going to

25:40.289 --> 25:45.695
audit. Boy, boy, boy. When it hits, it hits hard. 
I'm going to audit it one time. There's a good

25:50.260 --> 25:53.023
experience, you know. When it hit, it hit. Okay, I 
know about your low side. What are the high points

25:56.235 --> 25:59.718
of your, and I'll close it down in just a little bit. 
I'm in no rush. Okay. You want to take a break? My

26:01.800 --> 26:02.420
students need me. They're receiving hours. Okay. 
And they, three of them did this last week, so they

26:03.681 --> 26:08.145
know very well how to do it this week. And if they 
need me, they can get me on the paper. Okay. So just

26:11.008 --> 26:11.989
take your time. But what were the higher points of 
your practice? Time. And then what I want to ask you

26:16.112 --> 26:22.538
is sort of compare, a general comparison of your, 
of the academic side, the practice side. how you

26:22.855 --> 26:29.004
feel about veterinary medicine and 
veterinarians and where the profession's going

26:22.855 --> 26:29.004
and that kind of thing will wind it up pretty much at 
that level. But what were the high points now? I

26:30.466 --> 26:34.472
guess the high point was building the clinic and 
building the house. We bought a lot and built a home

26:34.532 --> 26:46.129
and a VA loan and built the clinic when I sold the 
little farm operation we had. Getting that

26:47.471 --> 26:52.238
together where we could work in the inside. enjoy 
that a lot more. Well that that was that was a high

26:57.056 --> 27:09.890
point of my practice is when I bought the furniture 
showroom shops and converted it into a veterinary

26:57.056 --> 27:09.890
clinic and until that time I didn't have any large 
ambulance services. I did it on ambulatory work

27:09.910 --> 27:13.835
and all the work in the field. Did you did you both 
kind of feel that throughout your practice that

27:15.397 --> 27:20.402
you sort of had the I don't know, you've got the 
esteem, the respect, or whatever the community

27:20.939 --> 27:26.346
around you, people, life, veterinarians. Is that 
an overstatement? I think so. I kind of said, yeah.

27:30.290 --> 27:36.298
The last veterinarian that the licensed 
practitioner had been there was, oh golly, it must

27:30.290 --> 27:36.298
have been 1916 or 1918. I believe the guy's name was 
Chris when he died of man's rats. But they had a

27:40.483 --> 27:43.627
great deal of respect for Dr. Burns there again. He 
was an outstanding individual in the community as

27:43.967 --> 27:48.853
a veterinarian. Do you feel that veterinarians 
have pretty well preserved that sense of

27:49.643 --> 27:57.314
identification with the community or supportive 
base? Well, I don't think practitioners are as

27:59.176 --> 28:06.186
much community-related now as they were when... 
It's so much of an urban society now. Okay, so you

28:08.790 --> 28:12.695
lose some of that personal identification. 
That's right, and they're just not as involved as

28:13.015 --> 28:17.682
much in community activities as they were. I've 
noticed this in I think this is one of the most

28:19.377 --> 28:24.351
dramatic things that I noticed when I was on the 
selection committee. Interviewing these kids,

28:25.294 --> 28:33.437
you ask them about how they would like to 
participate in community life when they're a

28:25.294 --> 28:33.437
veterinarian. And they're all coming from 
Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio,

28:33.704 --> 28:39.755
Austin. The big cities are not coming from these 
smaller communities where their dad or mother had

28:40.457 --> 28:51.257
an opportunity to serve on the school board, on the 
city council, and such as that. They just don't

28:51.541 --> 29:01.932
make that connection that you have the 
opportunity as a professional individual to

28:51.541 --> 29:01.932
participate in community activities or fairs 
like that. Have you noticed that, Charlie? Well,

29:06.377 --> 29:07.699
there's some reluctance. For some reason, they 
either participate in fun runs or jobs or clubs or

29:08.219 --> 29:20.873
something like that, but they don't seem to want to 
participate at the city council level or the

29:08.219 --> 29:20.873
school board. Yeah, or even the socials are 
community activity clubs. Rotary club or Lions

29:25.959 --> 29:31.826
Club, Kiwanis, you know, they don't, well, I 
didn't hear any talk about it. It's a different

29:31.846 --> 29:32.467
breed. Well, it doesn't make, they can't see it as 
making money for them. Yeah. And I think, well, I

29:36.411 --> 29:41.618
think all of society now is more concerned about 
the dollars than they were. Oh, I think so. Well, I

29:42.459 --> 29:43.200
sure do. I sure do. What I want to kind of ask, 
though, relating to this general idea is, how do

29:43.540 --> 29:48.666
you think the, um, the profile of the veterinarian 
has changed in the public mind as compared to the

29:49.355 --> 29:56.542
profile of the medical doctor. Because I see a 
rather large change in the way the public views the

29:57.323 --> 30:07.893
medical profession and less a change in the way the 
public views veterinarians. In other words, I

30:07.954 --> 30:15.901
think that the veterinarian still has, in a sense, 
a great deal of a sense of public affection, maybe.

30:15.941 --> 30:18.484
That's the wrong word, but that's the idea I want to 
get to. Whereas the doctor has become such a

30:18.920 --> 30:25.529
specialized and more impersonal character. Is 
that wrong? Well, it depends, though. I think,

30:28.538 --> 30:30.200
again, on the individual. Alcohol and drugs have 
taken a toll on both the veterinary profession and

30:30.401 --> 30:34.947
the medical profession. Yeah, I saw an article 
about that recently. I hadn't even really

30:36.589 --> 30:41.495
realized that veterinarians were so susceptible 
to that problem, but apparently they are. My first

30:42.096 --> 30:53.171
experience in practice, and that's about two 
years after I got there, was an EMD who had gotten on

30:42.096 --> 30:53.171
drugs, came and gave me a check to go buy drugs. I 
didn't know this until I got a check in England. But

30:55.690 --> 31:00.880
the veterinarians, the image the veterinarians 
have had is, of course, earlier you have to live

30:55.690 --> 31:00.880
now. Microchippers, snub dippers, whiskey 
drinkers, you know, hail raisers in general. yeah

31:08.397 --> 31:34.017
and uh i think we've been able to live that down i'm 
particularly proud of the female contingent of

31:08.397 --> 31:34.017
their medicine they dress well they groom 
themselves well they're not addicted to drugs and

31:08.397 --> 31:34.017
alcohol in my knowledge we've had some male 
members of the profession

31:08.397 --> 31:34.017
but the idea of professionalism i think it uh that 
everyone wants to contribute to raising the

31:36.089 --> 31:40.475
image. The thing that's bad is, like it is with the 
news media, the press got on this deal in Houston

31:40.556 --> 31:53.174
where the city council passed the licensing deal, 
and the veterinarians have to report the names of

31:40.556 --> 31:53.174
all who had their dogs vaccinated. You get 
involved with the news media, and then the

31:54.316 --> 31:59.724
veterinary profession gets the bad ball on the 
thing. The same thing with the old boy that had the

31:59.764 --> 32:03.850
42 dogs they picked up the other day. Again, this 
morning in the Houston Chronicle. You'd think

32:06.008 --> 32:07.767
that the veterinarian Tom Durrell was the one, you 
know, Tom owned Pasadena, was on Shaver, you know,

32:08.101 --> 32:15.130
when Mombardi was there. Tom's involved with it, 
and not really because he just knew the guy, but

32:15.470 --> 32:29.527
here's the veterinarian, he gets the fall, you 
know, so you have to be continually defending the

32:15.470 --> 32:29.527
profession and yourself and Leo's to such an 
extent that it will upgrade instead of that. Now, I

32:29.547 --> 32:36.235
picked up from Billy Tremere and some of the group 
over in San Antonio the sense that maybe the

32:29.547 --> 32:36.235
professionalism or the symbols of the 
profession, at least, are getting lost a little

32:36.772 --> 32:42.860
bit in this newer generation. Dress, deportment, 
attire. Oh, yeah. I think we've seen the whole

32:48.366 --> 32:52.131
circle, Henry.

32:54.915 --> 32:57.818
Let's go back to our executive secretary. When we 
graduated, Eddie Grist, have you met him yet? No.

33:01.915 --> 33:03.197
Have you been told about him? Not really. He's an 
invalid now in a wheelchair confined to a

33:04.798 --> 33:07.722
wheelchair. And he was in New Braunfels. New 
Braunfels, okay. And was extension veterinarian

33:11.426 --> 33:16.212
for when we were in school. And then he went into 
practice in New Braunfels and was the secretary

33:17.093 --> 33:24.722
for the TVMA. And at the time Eddie was secretary 
for the TVMA, dues were a dollar. Yeah. I remember

33:32.146 --> 33:44.207
the first TVMA meeting I went to was in San Antonio, 
and they had their business meeting, and then he

33:32.146 --> 33:44.207
kind of made the announcement that we were 
dismissed, and, oh, by the way, dues are a dollar.

33:44.248 --> 33:46.031
If you go out the door, we'll leave you a dollar. 
Yeah. A dollar. A dollar. Yeah. I think I copied

33:47.754 --> 33:49.437
some of the list. We went then from Eddie Grist as 
secretary of TVMA, and our first meeting,

33:55.595 --> 34:22.733
full-time executive secretary was paul blunt who 
was a veterinarian he was also an attorney and he

33:55.595 --> 34:22.733
was first a part-time executive secretary for the 
bear county veterinary association i'm

33:55.595 --> 34:22.733
surprised they didn't put you in on this i probably 
have that yeah i probably didn't have any records

33:55.595 --> 34:22.733
but

33:55.595 --> 34:22.733
uh Brown and Parker didn't. Were they present? 
R.D. Brown? No, both of them in the hospital that

34:27.965 --> 34:30.068
day. Is that right? Yes, sir. You've got to get 
those guys. Yeah, they said I should come back for

34:33.915 --> 34:36.459
them. They were partners. It was scheduled, and 
they both were in the hospital. They were two of the

34:40.706 --> 34:46.215
people in attendance at Bexar County meetings 
when I attended down there. Two of those people

34:46.235 --> 34:48.199
were. And Culpepper, their other partner. But 
Paul Blunt, then, was our first full-time

34:50.624 --> 34:55.692
executive secretary. And old Paul Blunt was 
poisoning with tobacco smoke. He'd get it right in

34:58.115 --> 35:07.930
your face, and he'd take a big, deep breath, and 
inhale it, and the whole time he was talking, just

34:58.115 --> 35:07.930
puffing this smoke right out in your face. And 
you'd be backing up to get out of it, and he'd be

35:07.950 --> 35:11.155
advancing. But he said, when he became executive 
secretary, he said, I'm going to take this

35:12.057 --> 35:19.568
profession out of cowboy boots and blue jeans and 
put them in coats and ties. And he did a pretty

35:20.290 --> 35:23.353
doggone good job of it. And that went on for, well, 
after Paul Blunt, we had Paul.

35:31.122 --> 35:35.046
He was the executive secretary when I was 
president. That's a good quote. I'm going to use

35:36.007 --> 35:40.252
that one. He wore the black leather jacket you're 
talking about? Oh, well, he was the PR man from

35:42.774 --> 35:47.159
Dallas. His name was Paul. Mm-hmm. I'll find it. 
Three o'clock in the morning, I'll call you. Okay,

35:52.257 --> 35:53.458
all right, fine. But anyway, he advanced the 
profession to the public by the news media. He made

36:02.726 --> 36:20.082
a concerted effort to gather news items of 
veterinarians' involvement in local politics or

36:02.726 --> 36:20.082
local community activity, and anything done of 
state newsworthiness, he disseminated that

36:02.726 --> 36:20.082
thoroughly. Well, he had me invited as president 
of TVMA to the Texas Medical Association meeting

36:20.416 --> 36:31.607
in Galveston as kind of a guest. Yeah, that's a good 
touch. I don't know whether it ever happened again

36:32.488 --> 36:34.310
or not. Yeah, that's a good touch. I'm not a fan of 
that. No, we had a meeting set with the TMA on

36:36.452 --> 36:44.761
appointment of somebody to the State Board of 
Health. I met an officer with those guys there.

36:48.327 --> 37:01.342
Well, for several years, I know we invited the 
president of the Texas Medical Association to our

36:48.327 --> 37:01.342
convictions, and it was a woman the year after I was 
president that attended the Fort Worth meeting.

37:01.362 --> 37:02.603
There's A. Owen. Yeah, A. Owen. She attended the 
TVMA meeting. But I think during those times, was

37:12.762 --> 37:19.810
probably when the greatest effort was made to 
raise the prestige of the veterinary profession

37:12.762 --> 37:19.810
to the public. And I think that they did a good job of 
it. But I do think that probably in the last 10 or 15

37:23.213 --> 37:27.598
years, there's been kind of a taper. Yeah, that's 
kind of what I picked up. Seeing young people come

37:29.320 --> 37:32.803
into the TVMA meeting and cutoffs. Yeah. Well, 
that's, again, the style of life part, I guess. It

37:36.187 --> 37:41.773
isn't so much that as I got a recent report from my 
daughter who took her dog into the clinic. This

37:42.142 --> 37:48.812
girl, when she was here, would dress Neiman 
Marcus, Neiman Marcus dresses, suits, nice.

37:50.093 --> 37:51.956
Carpenter, you remember that? Yeah, sure. She 
worked for Lloyd Petry. She came in with a jogging

37:55.121 --> 38:02.852
suit on, jogging shoes, whatever, playing 
baseball, you know, right in to talk to clients and

37:55.121 --> 38:02.852
work on that. Well, the medical profession is 
doing the same thing, Charles. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I

38:07.733 --> 38:09.535
agree with that. I know when my mother was sick, 
this was three years ago in the hospital, they had a

38:09.815 --> 38:24.629
medical doctor, he was a Latin, but you have Latin 
doctors, their dress is fine, but there was one

38:09.815 --> 38:24.629
down there that I thought was a custodian. He was up 
and down the halls all the time, and I wondered

38:25.390 --> 38:32.837
where his room was, because he was just dressed so 
sloppy and unkempt looking. Look at Red Duke when

38:33.222 --> 38:36.988
he does his thing. Oh yeah boy. One time he's got on 
the tub, the next time he's got on the tub. That's

38:41.095 --> 38:46.244
what I like about Scott and White, they do have some 
memoratory rules. Back to my clinic that built, my

38:46.524 --> 38:55.339
first one that I built in, turned it down to what 
turned out to be downtown Wesley Cove. When I moved

38:55.439 --> 38:58.825
out to the new clinic that I remodeled the 
furniture store, It turned into a fried chicken

38:59.581 --> 39:01.946
place. Is that right? They didn't make a go of it. In 
fact, they had a little fire in it. I don't know

39:06.035 --> 39:07.498
whether it was an insurance fire or not. It didn't 
do a whole lot of damage to the building, but it was

39:07.558 --> 39:15.555
vacant for a while and I sold it to a convenience 
store owner that was right next door to it. And then

39:16.798 --> 39:18.602
he eventually sold it to a medical doctor who was an 
Indian doctor, not an American Indian, an

39:19.207 --> 39:32.040
orthopedic surgeon, and his wife was also a 
doctor, and she was an obstetrician and

39:19.207 --> 39:32.040
gynecologist. And they took that little old brick 
building, 34 by 34 was the building I started off

39:33.221 --> 39:46.375
with, and I added on to it a kennel building in the 
back that was better constructed than the

39:33.221 --> 39:46.375
original building was, running it for $8,500. You 
can imagine it wasn't a whole lot of a building. But

39:49.379 --> 39:54.347
those people, between the two of them, just about 
own half of Westaco now. Is that right? Yeah. They

39:55.909 --> 40:04.683
built a new building on the street just back of it 
between my clinic and the local medical hospital.

40:05.584 --> 40:11.393
And they've parlayed their two medical degrees 
into a fortune in that community. It's amazing

40:11.413 --> 40:12.836
what those people have done. It's amazing what 
those people have done. The front was small

40:14.945 --> 40:21.896
animals and the large animal operating room was in 
the center and then the stable area in the other

40:14.945 --> 40:21.896
part. And I wore coveralls for the large animal 
work and I'd slip those off and slip on at least from

40:21.916 --> 40:34.455
the forward linen and towel supply three-quarter 
length white wraparound jackets and a white shirt

40:21.916 --> 40:34.455
and black bow tie. And, you know, you go in there, 
you're clean when you go to the front door. You

40:39.435 --> 40:42.218
small animal things, if you cover off, go out the 
back, you know. And it worked very well. The

40:44.460 --> 40:53.110
biggest harassment that I got when I came here is I 
had a pair of white books, shoes, red soles, you

40:44.460 --> 40:53.110
know. I wore those and kept my stethoscope. And you 
can imagine Jim Denton saying, hey, here comes Ben

40:56.254 --> 40:59.117
Casey. Oh, get out. But the students felt it. There 
was a horse man, a practitioner before, now Buzz, I

41:06.278 --> 41:16.993
can't remember Buzz's last name, but he also had a 
white box and more of a dress over there. And the

41:17.013 --> 41:27.847
students would harass you, but pretty soon you'd 
watch and they'd come cleaner or they'd come, but

41:17.013 --> 41:27.847
now we've got, I guess they still have a set rule of 
clean coveralls on campus. We've got some

41:27.907 --> 41:35.037
criticism by our students going over to the MSA and 
all the gay with clean coveralls. Well, I wore a

41:35.388 --> 41:39.933
white barber's coat, I guess, you know. Yeah. Like 
we used to have. Snap down the side. Yeah. Yeah. The

41:45.019 --> 41:48.042
same thing we wore when we were students. And I had 
what I call my dog shoes and my cow shoes. I kept a

41:53.448 --> 41:55.871
pair of field boots in the back of my car. I never 
practiced in a pickup. Most veterinarians don't

41:57.393 --> 42:01.237
practice, but I always used the trunk of my car. I 
wanted to be able to. put it in there and close the

42:02.692 --> 42:05.195
lid and shut it out of sight. I kept a pair of field 
boots in the backseat of my car in the floorboard.

42:10.902 --> 42:13.264
Well, on a country call, I'd put on my field boots. 
I'd get back to the clinic, I'd slip on my shoes.

42:15.647 --> 42:18.811
Most people wouldn't have to clean their shoes to 
go in the clinic. Is it true, incidentally, that

42:19.492 --> 42:31.045
the practice had, but it doesn't seem to be 
necessarily what I've gotten from you, that

42:19.492 --> 42:31.045
instead of you going to your clients, the clients 
are now coming to the veterinarian? That's the

42:31.447 --> 42:32.728
simplest statement. There's still people who 
make some out of college and larger operations.

42:36.372 --> 42:42.197
But yeah, by and large, I think the clinic 
facilities are such that they attract you to come

42:36.372 --> 42:42.197
in. And I know you were mentioning on the phone, the 
automobile really revolutionized the

42:42.217 --> 42:49.283
veterinary practice business as much as anything 
in the world. I had that Jeep, and I had a roll bar on

42:49.364 --> 42:56.250
it, and I had a metal cab built in, and I had a water 
tank on the back with a faucet on it, and all those

42:49.364 --> 42:56.250
things. When I couldn't drive up within 10 or 20 
feet of the patient, I was pretty perplexed. I've

43:02.910 --> 43:11.223
been to places where the creek bank was so steep 
that I'd be afraid to drive up and come back, so I'd

43:02.910 --> 43:11.223
back up the thing. I wanted to take the poleaxe and 
cut the bigger ones down. I'd drive over the little

43:13.287 --> 43:15.450
ones, you know, and get up to them. It was just there 
in sections in the field. Those things worked very

43:18.882 --> 43:21.127
well. We had mud roads. I can remember going 
three-quarters of a mile one time. It took me about

43:24.997 --> 43:30.671
45 minutes punching black mud with a hose and 
pouring that water in there and the thing balling

43:24.997 --> 43:30.671
up. And even a compound low four-wheel drive, you 
couldn't negotiate. You couldn't get through

43:34.340 --> 43:35.964
that many. Yes. That's another thing that helped 
the rural practices was farm to market rules. The

43:41.810 --> 43:46.156
improvement of travel methods and 
identification. The guy couldn't tell you where

43:46.637 --> 43:48.539
he lived. He didn't even have his name on the 
mailbox 90% of the time when I went into practice.

43:53.927 --> 43:55.289
Those things changed. Television, whatever. 
Television had a profound effect on it. They used

44:00.136 --> 44:02.039
to come to the house at 5 in the morning. Who's going 
to sleep all day? And when they got TV, they watched

44:04.377 --> 44:06.940
the late show. You see them come and call me about 7 
in the morning. They got off of that rack. Yeah.

44:12.466 --> 44:15.990
That's interesting.

44:17.352 --> 44:23.599
What do you think needs to be in a history of 
veterinary medicine that you would put in there

44:17.352 --> 44:23.599
particularly? Well, it'd be kind of like the 
encyclopedia. It'd be a whole set of it. Whatever

44:30.486 --> 44:31.127
you think. Yeah, and take plenty of volumes, you 
know, to include the people and the things that

44:31.428 --> 44:36.815
happened to them in Texas. But if you were to 
emphasize some quality, some aspect of the

44:36.895 --> 44:54.617
business, would you emphasize the... Well, I 
think the change from the feed store and the back of

44:36.895 --> 44:54.617
the drug store to your own clinics and the...

44:56.369 --> 45:00.736
participation at continuing education levels. 
These things need to be in there. The funded

45:03.460 --> 45:12.334
research, the cutting-edge research is 
developed by drug companies and veterinarians in

45:03.460 --> 45:12.334
their law. And is the product of most that result 
getting to the practitioner through continuing

45:13.816 --> 45:21.448
education programs, through your College of 
Veterinary Medicine? I think that there's an

45:22.390 --> 45:27.738
interesting contrast there, too. Even the other 
professions, I think conventions, to the general

45:27.779 --> 45:36.412
public, means going off and having a good time. And 
I think forever. Veterinary conventions have

45:40.497 --> 45:43.780
involved continuing education. I think there's 
been a concerted effort on veterinarians to stay

45:43.800 --> 46:03.961
abreast of their, well, it's been such a rapidly 
developing field that we have felt the challenge

45:43.800 --> 46:03.961
of dealing with so many different species of 
animals, and general practitioners were not

45:43.800 --> 46:03.961
limited to one species or one aspect of... I mean, 
exhibit halls are just a valuable tool,

46:07.177 --> 46:08.479
information tool. I know it is in your 
conventions. Just walk around seeing the new

46:11.343 --> 46:16.550
equipment and ideas and medicines. I know it is in 
history. I go around and look at the book exhibit.

46:21.757 --> 46:22.718
We have conventions. Well, that's part of the 
academy, I guess, is to plan a convention off

46:22.758 --> 46:30.248
somewhere that provides a place to take the family 
for. a vacation. But generally speaking,

46:32.334 --> 46:38.567
throughout the nation, and maybe even throughout 
the world, I don't know, I haven't attended that

46:32.334 --> 46:38.567
much.

46:41.694 --> 46:42.476
Or even read that much. Do both of you go to the 
American Veterinary Medical Conventions? Yeah,

46:46.597 --> 46:48.159
ABMA. ABMA, yeah. Yeah, I have, you know, he told 
me, as I've been the senior member a while ago, you

46:49.480 --> 46:56.689
know, I have some advantages he doesn't have now in 
retirement. I have a complimentary membership of

46:57.269 --> 47:02.035
the American Bovine Practitioners, the ABMA. I 
was a contingent 40-year uninterrupted

47:02.675 --> 47:08.482
membership in TVMA and ABMA both. So they gave me 
complimentary memberships, though,

47:08.943 --> 47:13.328
complimentary registration in ABMA. That's 
good, yeah. So, you know, that's it. I think for

47:16.297 --> 47:25.529
small animal practitioners, that's been the 
Cadillac of convention. And I think this is

47:25.890 --> 47:34.521
another aspect of veterinary medicine too that 
could receive a little attention. Long about the,

47:36.765 --> 47:40.870
well, the 40s and the 50s,
