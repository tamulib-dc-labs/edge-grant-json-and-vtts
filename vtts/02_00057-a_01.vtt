WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:03.709
Two of testing now.

00:05.373 --> 00:10.524
Okay, now we're testing and this is Thursday the 28th.

00:10.744 --> 00:11.967
28th is it?

00:12.127 --> 00:12.428
Okay.

00:13.069 --> 00:13.510
I think it's.

00:13.530 --> 00:13.891
All right.

00:15.094 --> 00:16.476
Say something.

00:16.497 --> 00:17.659
I thought it was 27th.

00:17.719 --> 00:19.262
That was yesterday, wasn't it?

00:19.363 --> 00:20.505
I did too.

00:20.525 --> 00:21.187
28th, okay.

00:21.207 --> 00:22.309
Until I checked my calendar.

00:24.314 --> 00:34.780
June 28th we are in the Evans Library and I have the honor and pleasure of trying to record as much as we can of the

00:35.114 --> 00:38.960
experiences here at A&M of Major General Tom Darling.

00:39.722 --> 00:50.239
To introduce yourself to anybody that listened to the tape or read the transcription, give a biographical summary of life before you came down.

00:50.439 --> 00:51.120
Where'd you grow up?

00:51.180 --> 00:52.322
What did mom and dad do?

00:52.763 --> 00:53.905
Where'd you go to high school?

00:55.327 --> 00:58.012
Summarize until you're ready to go off to college.

00:58.733 --> 00:59.454
Okay, very well.

00:59.594 --> 01:01.898
I'd be pleased to do that.

01:02.080 --> 01:07.065
My background, I suppose, was not a lot different to people of my age.

01:07.085 --> 01:10.789
I was born in 1932 in Abilene, Texas.

01:12.130 --> 01:29.708
My parents lived on a dairy farm, worked on a dairy farm just out of Abilene, and they had originally migrated there from northeast Texas in the Depression years, and jobs were hard, but there was some lead out there on a job.

01:30.363 --> 01:36.249
And they went out there and later went to work on this kind of operating a farm, a dairy farm.

01:36.289 --> 01:38.752
My dad did that for many years.

01:38.792 --> 01:46.841
He didn't own the thing, but he sort of ran the dairy herd and helped run the farm and did a little sharecropping.

01:47.081 --> 01:53.408
My mother and dad and either one graduated from high school over in deep east Texas where they attended school.

01:53.428 --> 01:59.374
I think out in the country it dropped off at grade 10 and they had to go into town or somewhere.

01:59.624 --> 02:04.391
They neither one had a high school degree or diploma.

02:05.112 --> 02:16.428
My dad did attend the business school just a little bit, but primarily he was a farm worker and he do a lot about dairy farming and managing a herd of 100 dairy cows.

02:17.129 --> 02:23.758
So I grew up on that dairy farm about five or six miles out of Abilene and

02:24.413 --> 02:26.316
We didn't have any close neighbors.

02:26.436 --> 02:29.520
I think a mile or so would have been the closest neighbor we had.

02:29.620 --> 02:33.505
I went to a small rural school called Elmdale.

02:33.745 --> 02:38.852
The community still exists, but the little store and all that were there are no longer there.

02:38.952 --> 02:42.357
All that's sort of included in the edge of Abilene now.

02:42.557 --> 02:46.202
But anyway, I went to a small rural school.

02:48.926 --> 02:50.768
Only half a dozen teachers.

02:50.828 --> 02:52.210
We had two grades.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.259
in one classroom.

02:54.379 --> 03:06.673
I remember in the second grade watching the third grade learn their multiplication tables and I see debated in the paper something this week about when do you teach the multiplication tables, what grade, but I remember that very well.

03:07.214 --> 03:08.756
It was the third grade when I went to school.

03:08.776 --> 03:18.467
But anyway, we went, I went through eight grades there at this small rural school and then transferred into Abilene High School.

03:18.869 --> 03:20.911
which was a good-sized high school.

03:20.971 --> 03:24.955
It was a top-of-the-class double-A high school in those days.

03:25.015 --> 03:30.120
We had a little over 300 in my graduating class there, but I went all four years to Abilene High School.

03:31.141 --> 03:33.223
I graduated there in the spring of 1950.

03:35.265 --> 03:39.169
Growing up, I learned hard work.

03:40.971 --> 03:46.176
I hold cotton for 50 cents an hour and headed maize and

03:46.865 --> 03:53.578
drove the tractor and did a lot of farm work, a lot of hard work, fence building and all of those things.

03:54.780 --> 04:06.443
And I remember ideas about college were given to me primarily by my dad as far back as I can remember.

04:07.030 --> 04:09.553
He kept saying, son, you need to go to college.

04:10.114 --> 04:15.139
We want you to have it better than we had, which was a common thing with people at that time.

04:15.239 --> 04:17.102
They wanted something better for their kids.

04:17.162 --> 04:34.742
But he enrolled in all of the extension programs and took the bulletins from the extension service here, and I'd see these things, and they were stamped Texas A&M, and got involved in 4-H club work as a youngster.

04:35.195 --> 04:47.112
helped advise some, and we'd go to the summer camps, and we'd have people from A&M, from wildlife, Dr. Potts, I remember him bringing all his stuffed animals and giving these demonstrations.

04:48.354 --> 04:59.650
So A&M became more and more on my mind, but as far back as I can remember, that's the only place I wanted to go, and my dad helped shape that.

05:00.153 --> 05:07.040
this dairy farm that we lived on was owned by a man by the name of Pitzer, P-I-T-Z-E-R.

05:08.381 --> 05:16.909
And he had two boys, his oldest son, Ted Pitzer, who was class of 50, I believe, here at Texas A&M.

05:16.969 --> 05:18.631
He was four years ahead of me.

05:19.552 --> 05:25.798
But he came on to A&M, and I remember him wearing his uniform and hearing things about A&M from him.

05:26.118 --> 05:29.181
But Ted Pitzer went on to become the

05:30.005 --> 05:35.514
that headed the Association of Former Students when the Alumni Center was opened in 1987.

05:35.934 --> 05:38.879
Unfortunately, he passed away about then.

05:39.079 --> 05:50.858
But Ted Pitzer, the son of the man that owned this farm that I grew up on, was a guy that I remember well and helped me think about A&M and want to come here.

05:51.639 --> 05:56.046
But I do remember World War II very well, although I didn't serve in that, of course.

05:56.735 --> 06:07.694
But all of those things had a deep impression on me, and being in the military or serving was something I felt compelled to do, and I wanted to do that.

06:07.774 --> 06:14.044
So when I came to A&M, I knew that they had military programs here and you could get a commission here.

06:14.986 --> 06:17.751
You know, it didn't dawn on me what service they were talking about.

06:17.831 --> 06:21.477
I assumed Army, I guess, but I knew they had a green coat and all that.

06:21.946 --> 06:25.895
I would be an ROTC and hopefully get a commission out.

06:25.915 --> 06:30.646
That all sounded very attractive to me, a better way to go than to be drafted or something.

06:30.706 --> 06:35.437
And so all of that kind of led me to Texas A&M.

06:36.379 --> 06:39.887
My folks, again, were very poor people, didn't have...

06:40.694 --> 06:43.257
many resources of the world of their own.

06:43.878 --> 06:58.598
And I had an older brother, Jim, he's two years older than I am, and he attended John Tarleton first two years, 48 and 49, and he and I both came to A&M in the fall of 50.

06:58.699 --> 07:04.947
He was a transfer from Tarleton, started out in the Corps, and I was a fish.

07:05.298 --> 07:07.700
in the Corps, but we came to A&M together.

07:07.801 --> 07:11.865
And then I had a younger sister, about a year and a half younger than me.

07:12.906 --> 07:17.270
And she was still in high school, of course, but later she went on to North Texas.

07:18.231 --> 07:21.214
So there were three of us in college at one time.

07:21.895 --> 07:27.280
And it really didn't dawn on me what a burden that would be financially for my parents.

07:27.981 --> 07:31.845
I really had not heard of any scholarships or anything.

07:31.977 --> 07:41.430
Again, when I came to A&M, I saw some people did have table waiting jobs in the dining hall and things like that, but I didn't hear of many scholarships.

07:42.692 --> 07:46.557
And me, financial aid in those days was go get a job.

07:47.899 --> 07:52.485
Had you, before you came to register, had you ever been to the campus to visit?

07:52.505 --> 07:53.086
Okay.

07:53.767 --> 07:57.732
In high school, I played on a basketball team there.

07:58.522 --> 08:02.367
and had done fairly well as a basketball player and as a team.

08:03.088 --> 08:08.734
And one of the fellows on the team, well, in fact, there were three of us, I believe, came to A&M and fought together.

08:09.395 --> 08:11.558
But his dad had graduated from A&M.

08:11.738 --> 08:12.939
His name was Val Montgomery.

08:12.979 --> 08:18.206
He was a Yale leader in my class, but one of my best friends in Abilene growing up.

08:18.266 --> 08:23.432
We played ball together and all, but his dad was an engineer and had graduated from A&M.

08:23.783 --> 08:26.927
So he brought us down here one time to visit.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.691
This was the main visit we made about coming to A&M.

08:30.892 --> 08:35.477
And I'll back up in a moment and tell you about one previous visit I'd made to A&M.

08:35.497 --> 08:40.143
But anyway, they brought us down, and we were all committed to come.

08:40.163 --> 08:41.384
It wasn't a question of wanting.

08:41.444 --> 08:42.245
We wanted to come.

08:43.266 --> 08:46.230
And I remember visiting with Coach Marty Corot.

08:46.396 --> 08:54.472
who had been the basketball coach, but he was in the process of moving from A&M to Ohio State as the head baseball coach.

08:55.214 --> 08:58.140
Marty Corot was a famous name in college athletics in those days.

08:58.280 --> 09:04.573
I was very impressed to sit down with Marty Corot and talk about coming to A&M and play basketball.

09:05.110 --> 09:15.597
And he had had a recruiter that had watched us in one tournament out there and he told, it was two of us I guess, he said, I can't offer you a scholarship or anything.

09:15.617 --> 09:16.960
I don't have anything to offer you.

09:17.395 --> 09:21.423
but I will put you in an athletic dorm and you know we'll see how you can do.

09:22.686 --> 09:24.990
And that was that visit to A&M.

09:25.050 --> 09:27.114
I did have a previous visit to A&M.

09:27.796 --> 09:36.133
I said I was in a 4-H later in high school I was in FFA work and I was president of our local high school chapter and all that thing.

09:36.173 --> 09:37.395
My brother

09:37.375 --> 10:06.673
just ahead of me he'd been state ffa president he'd won the national public speaking contest in ffa so we were all very hooked in to 4-h and ffa and i was on the high school dairy judging team and we'd won our little area there and we want to write and won the district and we'd won the opportunity to come to a m to participate in the state dairy judging contest this was my junior year in high school

10:07.312 --> 10:11.918
And we came down here and we won first place in state dairy judging.

10:12.899 --> 10:14.221
And I was on cloud nine.

10:14.461 --> 10:16.604
My BOAG teacher, Mr. J.I.

10:16.624 --> 10:22.311
Moore, I never will forget him there in Abilene, was one of the, you know, my heroes.

10:23.072 --> 10:28.720
But he did more probably than my parents, anyone but my parents, in shaping me.

10:28.780 --> 10:32.224
Of course, he directed me to A&M too, having been a graduate of A&M.

10:33.105 --> 10:36.610
But we came down to A&M and won that dairy judging contest and

10:37.079 --> 10:43.859
I remember driving all the way back to Abilene and Mr. Moore and the three of us on the team, we talked and visited.

10:44.581 --> 10:50.498
We got the opportunity to go to the National Dairy Judging Contest in Waterloo, Iowa that fall.

10:51.136 --> 10:58.508
So we get on a train and ride all the way to Waterloo, Iowa and participate in the National Dairy Judging Contest.

10:59.069 --> 11:02.435
We won a second division rating or something.

11:02.475 --> 11:04.278
We didn't win the whole thing up there.

11:04.358 --> 11:12.672
But anyway, it was my first trip really out of Texas and my exposure to some other part of the country, my first train ride like that.

11:13.327 --> 11:19.199
All of that was fun and some things that I have good memories of.

11:19.259 --> 11:31.283
But anyway, the two trips I'd had to A&M were on the dairy judging and also when we came down really to see the coach and say, yes, we want to come and find out a little bit more about it.

11:31.403 --> 11:33.968
I don't remember much about it.

11:34.336 --> 11:37.562
pre-registration or anything like that.

11:37.642 --> 11:42.450
I just remember when we came, we all went through this big line over in Cebiza.

11:42.470 --> 11:54.150
It was all a manual system, and you'd run over at this table, and they'd say, no, we're full up, and then you'd run over to another one, and you'd try to get you a schedule that you wanted.

11:54.772 --> 12:08.148
Again, back to my pre-A&M days, they sold off the dairy herd and we just were straight farming, but I had summer jobs working in the grain harvest.

12:08.168 --> 12:18.400
A neighbor of ours had a fleet of combines and needed operators to pull those, and I did that for about three summers.

12:19.544 --> 12:23.611
I was driving a tractor before I ever had a license to drive a car.

12:24.593 --> 12:33.688
One other interesting thing, prior to coming to A&M, we lived out in the country there, and really I was not in the Abilene School District.

12:33.708 --> 12:36.212
We lived just across the county line.

12:36.333 --> 12:41.822
Our house was about 200 yards into the Callahan County.

12:42.376 --> 12:50.167
And we should go to this little school back through the winding roads over there called Eula, E-U-L-A, a little small school.

12:50.668 --> 13:01.343
I don't remember being there once or twice in my life, but the roads were very poor, very rough and unpassable in inclement weather when it rained and muddy and all that.

13:01.363 --> 13:02.264
You couldn't even get there.

13:02.525 --> 13:03.546
The buses couldn't come.

13:04.928 --> 13:10.476
And my parents very much wanted me to be able to go, all three of us, to go to Abilene High School.

13:10.962 --> 13:14.587
rather than this little small rural school that we couldn't get to.

13:15.789 --> 13:26.543
And, you know, it ended up, most of those years I was in high school, my parents had to pay the tuition because the school district wouldn't transfer us to Abilene.

13:27.204 --> 13:35.796
Although we drove the other way, we rode the milk truck, we did all of these things, the school bus came within a mile of our house, all of that.

13:35.816 --> 13:39.501
But the Eula School District couldn't even get within five miles of us.

13:39.802 --> 13:42.044
But still, they wouldn't honor a transfer.

13:42.144 --> 13:48.551
So my parents, as poor as they were, had to foot the bill for us to pay that tuition.

13:48.631 --> 13:49.712
I don't remember what it was.

13:49.813 --> 13:51.194
It probably wasn't a great amount.

13:51.254 --> 13:53.356
But nonetheless, it was a burden for them.

13:53.536 --> 13:59.283
But in hindsight, I'm very glad that I had the opportunity to attend what I thought was a very good high school.

13:59.343 --> 14:00.444
I had good teachers there.

14:00.484 --> 14:07.311
And when I came to A&M, I think I was ahead of a lot of the students

14:07.612 --> 14:08.433
that came with me.

14:08.794 --> 14:17.686
A lot of them were from very small schools that perhaps didn't have all the resources and all that we had in Abilene at the time.

14:18.487 --> 14:22.993
But anyway, I counted a blessing that I got to attend Abilene High School.

14:24.896 --> 14:31.405
But work on the farm all the time was something that we just grew up with.

14:31.505 --> 14:36.572
And when it came time to go to college, I was glad to come.

14:37.463 --> 14:39.847
One reason, I was ready to get away from that hard work.

14:40.728 --> 14:42.751
I mean, it was long and hot and sweaty.

14:43.732 --> 14:52.646
And when I got to A&M, I heard these stories about people wanting to quit.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.849
And I've heard them all my years since then.

14:54.909 --> 14:57.433
Everybody comes to A&M, especially in the Corps.

14:57.473 --> 15:00.377
You know, you think at least once or twice about seriously quitting.

15:00.918 --> 15:04.163
I can honestly say it never entered my mind.

15:04.598 --> 15:19.384
Once I came, I was so proud and glad to be here and so pleased that I might have an opportunity to make something better of my life that I wouldn't have to return to be just a farm laborer, which was essentially what my dad was.

15:19.567 --> 15:27.538
I'm assuming also one of the other factors relating to that is you didn't want to have to face your parents to explain to them why.

15:27.819 --> 15:28.840
Well, that's true.

15:29.261 --> 15:35.230
I know they never had any doubts about me staying, and I never expressed any doubt to them either.

15:35.370 --> 15:45.304
But anyway, I worked through that summer before I came, and I believe my mother brought me to A&M in our old car.

15:46.027 --> 15:47.769
and I had very little with me.

15:47.889 --> 15:49.271
We didn't have much in the rooms.

15:49.351 --> 15:53.155
All you needed was... Did you already have your footlocker?

15:53.576 --> 15:54.417
I had a footlocker.

15:54.557 --> 15:56.479
Let's see, I got one, I believe, to come here.

15:56.499 --> 16:06.730
I had a footlocker and, you know, my underwear, and I think we were allowed to bring a little small radio maybe with us, and maybe the towels, I don't recall.

16:06.811 --> 16:09.373
But, you know, just the very basic things.

16:09.393 --> 16:13.418
It didn't take a lot of space, and I remember the rooms we had

16:13.702 --> 16:24.872
All we had was a double deck bed in there, steel bed, and we each room, remember each roommate had a desk and a chair in your footlocker and nothing on the floor.

16:24.892 --> 16:27.534
It was pretty basic and so, you know.

16:27.574 --> 16:30.917
How did you locate that room?

16:30.937 --> 16:32.799
Did you know before you came?

16:32.859 --> 16:33.279
Yes.

16:33.559 --> 16:34.280
Okay.

16:34.300 --> 16:40.025
I mentioned earlier that the coach had promised us that he would put us in the athletic dorm.

16:40.285 --> 16:41.006
And that was where?

16:41.086 --> 16:42.427
That was Hart Hall.

16:42.447 --> 16:43.708
I didn't, I,

16:43.688 --> 17:03.732
I think I saw Hart Hall when we came down on that visit I knew roughly course the campus was not huge in those days and there's a main street that ran up in front of Hart Hall there and we parked on each side there but they brought my mother brought me and let me out there Hart Hall and I moved in and she took off.

17:04.012 --> 17:05.494
Do you remember anything that

17:06.335 --> 17:10.160
she and you said to each other when she was there?

17:10.700 --> 17:18.750
I can't remember anything specific about that departure.

17:18.810 --> 17:22.815
I've heard those kind of stories where they give you some bit of instruction or something.

17:23.035 --> 17:27.060
And did your dad say anything before you left home?

17:27.597 --> 17:29.721
Just a word of encouragement.

17:30.823 --> 17:40.519
You know, again, I think with an expectation that I was going to make it, that there was no question that he was glad I was going and that sort of thing, but no, no.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.324
And there was no fish camp then, was there?

17:43.344 --> 17:44.106
No fish camp.

17:46.550 --> 17:47.732
Seemed like we did.

17:48.134 --> 17:51.458
maybe report two or three days early or something like that.

17:51.518 --> 17:52.279
I remember that.

17:53.540 --> 18:09.600
But I do remember after I was dropped off and checked into the dorm there, I was assigned a room there on the first floor in C Stoop, we called it, the C Corridor, and got a roommate there.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.461
I remember him.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.263
He didn't stay very long.

18:12.443 --> 18:15.627
Billy Jeffrey was a kid from the valley.

18:16.113 --> 18:18.537
But got in there and, you know, start meeting these other people.

18:18.577 --> 18:22.143
But one of the first things we, it was on a Sunday.

18:24.508 --> 18:29.877
And that afternoon for the evening meal, the first sergeant told us to fall out.

18:31.379 --> 18:34.184
We fell out in the street there in front of Hart Hall.

18:34.645 --> 18:36.048
Civilian clothes.

18:36.068 --> 18:40.956
Civilian clothes at that time to march up to Cebisa Hall for dinner.

18:41.965 --> 18:46.217
And I remember very well, my commanding officer was a guy by the name of Julian Herring.

18:46.317 --> 18:47.199
He was from Abilene.

18:47.219 --> 18:48.804
I had known Julian a little bit.

18:48.824 --> 18:52.153
He was ahead of me, but he ran track and all.

18:52.213 --> 18:55.823
But he was a track man at A&M, very fine individual.

18:56.309 --> 18:59.717
I was assigned to Company B Athletics in those days.

19:00.459 --> 19:13.710
Hart Hall was divided between Company A Athletics, which was all football players, and then essentially the other half of the dormitory was all the other sports, basketball, baseball, swimming, track,

19:13.690 --> 19:18.176
all of those, so we were all sort of together in one company.

19:18.796 --> 19:27.647
But Julian Herring of Abilene, I believe he was a petroleum engineer if I remember correctly, was a commanding officer, a guy that I really respected.

19:27.847 --> 19:38.861
I still can remember the, you know, the way he handled himself and, you know, I thought, hey, that's the guy I want to be like.

19:38.881 --> 19:42.145
And the first sergeant was a fellow by the name of Ralph Ellis from Dallas.

19:43.087 --> 19:44.389
And Ralph was a swimmer.

19:46.753 --> 19:47.775
Very good man, too.

19:47.975 --> 19:50.760
But he had to play the role of first sergeant, which is a little different.

19:50.800 --> 19:57.853
You know, he had to teach us some of the first things about dress right, dress and about face and all of that stuff.

19:57.933 --> 19:59.896
And that was all very confusing to me.

20:00.677 --> 20:01.799
It was kind of surprising.

20:01.879 --> 20:03.683
I wasn't expecting that, I guess.

20:03.723 --> 20:06.828
But it kind of struck me as, oh, I didn't know about this.

20:08.030 --> 20:08.571
And...

20:09.209 --> 20:16.317
But anyway, we got oriented and we had to go through that week to get our uniforms, had to go through the process.

20:16.397 --> 20:24.387
And I never will forget, they had some old warehouses over there, the ROTC shacks and all that, but it's over there somewhere and I can't even picture where it is now.

20:25.168 --> 20:27.791
But there was a big warehouse thing that we had to line up.

20:28.532 --> 20:30.915
It took us all day to get our uniforms.

20:31.035 --> 20:36.381
I never will forget how hot and miserable it was standing in line

20:36.732 --> 20:40.198
And I thought at the time, you know, there must be a better way to do this.

20:40.840 --> 20:45.408
But my years at A&M, it was mostly standing in line.

20:46.169 --> 20:55.126
Line still bug me today, and it stems from that first year at A&M when we had to stand in line so long to do almost everything.

20:55.367 --> 20:59.955
And some of the uniforms y'all were issued were new clothing and some were used?

21:00.070 --> 21:01.172
Yes, yes.

21:02.634 --> 21:08.003
We had a bag there, and it was old starch stuff mostly for the summer uniform anyway.

21:08.063 --> 21:15.174
But they had a laundry turn in, and we'd put our laundry together on a certain day and pick it up.

21:15.194 --> 21:18.299
But I remember those pants and shirts, they'd stand on their own.

21:18.319 --> 21:21.324
They were so stiff when you get them back.

21:21.344 --> 21:26.112
But when I got that uniform and all, I felt pretty proud.

21:26.092 --> 21:36.663
Describe the, now the, were the sophomores here when you arrived, the first day or two?

21:36.683 --> 21:38.765
There were some here as I recall.

21:38.785 --> 21:40.507
You know, that's not real clear.

21:40.927 --> 21:45.171
I do remember it was primarily the CO and the first sergeant that we were dealing with.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.414
And classes were two or three days away?

21:47.434 --> 21:50.857
They were just, we were here a little, I believe, early.

21:51.298 --> 21:54.681
I don't recall the exact sequence and schedule there, but

21:54.661 --> 21:59.947
We had a little bit, because I do remember we had some testing we went through in the basic division.

22:00.627 --> 22:02.990
They kept talking about the basic division.

22:03.330 --> 22:05.493
I never heard that term before.

22:05.513 --> 22:10.158
And Dr. Cliff Ransdell was one of the main guys in that.

22:10.258 --> 22:19.027
And I never will forget him talking to us, but I guess it was kind of like orientation, a combination of some things we have today.

22:19.127 --> 22:24.313
But it seemed like we had to take one course in the basic division there.

22:25.897 --> 22:28.942
But it was a course that every freshman had to take, I believe.

22:28.962 --> 22:33.809
But I do remember some of that and doing some testing.

22:33.990 --> 22:37.876
And I don't remember what they did with that testing.

22:37.916 --> 22:42.262
I think it helped maybe in the placement of some courses and all.

22:42.282 --> 22:47.871
And describe how you and your buddies, you and your classmates were,

22:48.762 --> 22:52.826
oriented in terms of traditions and hazing and whatever else.

22:52.846 --> 22:54.248
How did they get y'all broken in?

22:54.628 --> 22:59.313
Well, I believe we were the first freshman class back on campus, as I recall.

22:59.373 --> 23:03.057
Our sophomores had all been over at O'Brien Air Base.

23:03.077 --> 23:11.506
So, you know, they were glad to be here and they were really gonna, I guess, get us straightened out and oriented in the right direction.

23:12.667 --> 23:14.449
But I don't remember

23:16.015 --> 23:35.458
too much of the hazing and stuff that you might think of you know as in the first few days they didn't harass us too badly but again being in athletic dorm was a little different and there were no hallways were there no hallways per se that you just had these

23:35.438 --> 23:41.309
ramps that went up four floors and it's just that stoop or corridor, whatever you call it.

23:41.369 --> 23:43.513
So, you know, you couldn't get people together.

23:43.573 --> 23:45.436
So they couldn't line you up in the hallway?

23:45.456 --> 23:45.697
No.

23:45.717 --> 23:48.822
Mainly it was in the formations.

23:48.963 --> 23:54.713
We did have a meeting or two, as I remember that right off where they lectured us and told us.

23:55.283 --> 24:18.186
and taught us how to wear the uniform and all that thing all of those kind of things but at the dining hall i remember they they got after us pretty good describe that well again i learned that you know there's privileges starting at the top here and freshmen didn't have any and we we had to do all these errands and details and

24:18.740 --> 24:25.449
answer questions and that was every meal practice it seemed.

24:26.230 --> 24:29.294
Did you have any favorite Cush questions or?

24:30.516 --> 24:35.122
Oh, I can't say that I had a favorite like that.

24:35.162 --> 24:40.449
I do remember we had Cush questions and the seniors like to play joke, like to do things.

24:40.609 --> 24:45.676
They detail some fish to go over to do something to some senior.

24:45.716 --> 24:47.278
That was a favorite trick.

24:47.663 --> 25:05.941
And, you know, you'd be ordered to go steal this guy's dessert or take his water away or just all kind of things, you know, from getting his chair to you name it, kind of things that they had us doing.

25:06.041 --> 25:11.246
But some of it seemed like it was trying to belittle us.

25:11.366 --> 25:14.970
And I heard the stories, you know, we start you out at the bottom.

25:15.271 --> 25:23.041
You're all alike here and we put this uniform on you and there's no difference in economic status or anything.

25:23.101 --> 25:26.185
I'd heard that story from the first day I got here.

25:26.706 --> 25:37.259
And I came to believe that, that there is something in the core that's special about kind of starting everyone out on the same tier.

25:39.382 --> 25:44.248
And I can say that even though I came from a very poor background,

25:44.684 --> 25:56.044
I was treated pretty much like every other student, and I think it was pretty much on you earn your grades and you earn your status.

25:57.747 --> 25:58.889
I liked that.

25:59.029 --> 26:01.573
I liked that because it gave me an opportunity that I wouldn't have.

26:01.653 --> 26:02.835
Socially, I didn't have that.

26:03.877 --> 26:06.642
I would not have had that opportunity.

26:07.482 --> 26:19.480
Some of these guys had, you know, been involved in a lot of social things in high school and all, and I really didn't have that much opportunity to participate socially because I was working.

26:19.540 --> 26:22.244
We didn't have neighbors and that sort of thing.

26:23.265 --> 26:30.777
How long was it before you all did any pranks or assigned jokes in the dining hall?

26:31.257 --> 26:34.502
Well, that started off pretty quickly, very quickly.

26:35.005 --> 26:35.666
Very quickly.

26:35.986 --> 26:39.651
And I remember we'd get hassled on campus.

26:39.912 --> 26:43.917
Sophomores, you know, kind of had a free run at us and ask us all these questions.

26:43.937 --> 26:47.822
And I became a little frustrated that you couldn't satisfy any of them.

26:47.842 --> 26:48.923
I didn't understand that.

26:49.644 --> 26:51.607
But I just couldn't satisfy any of them.

26:51.927 --> 26:57.655
This learning to whip out and meet, that was one thing they taught us very early on and why they did that.

26:58.208 --> 26:59.530
You know, that's pretty neat.

27:01.313 --> 27:07.662
But that was a pretty respected thing that we did back then and I don't remember too much playing around with that.

27:07.722 --> 27:09.044
That was kind of serious business.

27:09.685 --> 27:14.492
And they told us, you know, we had to know the names of everybody in our outfit and be able to call them.

27:14.512 --> 27:17.837
You had to speak and that speaking to each other was

27:18.492 --> 27:20.134
Oh, stressed very much.

27:20.714 --> 27:25.920
But there are some of the things that I've seen here since I've been back at A&M that I don't recall us doing back in those days.

27:26.601 --> 27:31.786
I think in some ways some of that has moved the wrong direction from what I remember.

27:32.287 --> 27:39.975
But back to where the, you know, what I remember as being very uncomfortable was football games.

27:41.376 --> 27:44.279
The core all set together down there on the east side.

27:44.359 --> 27:47.723
And I was a big sports nut when I came to A&M.

27:48.462 --> 27:52.488
I kept up with, I read the paper cover to cover every day.

27:52.508 --> 27:55.913
I could tell you the batting average of every player in the major league.

27:55.993 --> 27:59.118
I just read it and I could remember that right at it.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.842
People used to say, how do you remember that?

28:01.962 --> 28:04.867
I say, well, if you're really interested in something, you can remember it.

28:05.688 --> 28:06.830
That was my philosophy.

28:06.850 --> 28:08.432
And I think there's some truth in that.

28:08.452 --> 28:13.460
But anyway, I was really looking forward to the football games at A&M.

28:13.520 --> 28:16.444
To be at A&M made me feel very proud.

28:16.795 --> 28:17.436
back up.

28:17.616 --> 28:38.567
I remember we had to go to Guyon Hall for some orientation or something and I just sat there and looked around and I was so elated about being here and thinking I'm sitting here at this great university and this great hall and you know, I've come a long way to be here, just to be here.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.782
But anyway, back to the football game.

28:40.843 --> 28:42.044
I was really looking forward.

28:42.164 --> 28:45.809
I had a practice game there one Saturday before the season started.

28:45.909 --> 28:47.631
I went out and watched all of that.

28:48.372 --> 28:49.553
I was just really into it.

28:50.074 --> 28:53.558
We played that first home football game, and we marched into the stadium.

28:54.399 --> 28:58.464
Golly, we sit down, and the sophomores are just all over us.

28:59.666 --> 29:01.568
I mean all over us.

29:02.577 --> 29:04.399
And I didn't get to see any of the football game.

29:04.920 --> 29:09.886
But the sophomores sat there right behind the freshmen, I guess it was, or amongst us.

29:10.988 --> 29:12.810
And most of them had a big cigar.

29:14.132 --> 29:21.881
And they'd puff on that cigar and blow smoke in your face and ask you all kind of impossible questions and harass you.

29:22.682 --> 29:30.272
And that was really one of the most uncomfortable, unpleasant experiences I had as a freshman was going to the football games.

29:30.387 --> 29:56.884
did were the rest of the games that year home games about like the first one uh i i would say so it was it was pretty fair game to for the sophomores but i but i did i'll come to it a little later maybe but i ended up getting a job later and i escaped some of that harassing that we had i never will forget i believe it was the oklahoma game we played oklahoma

29:57.455 --> 29:57.976
that year.

29:58.637 --> 30:02.302
Billy Vessels was a star halfback, all-American halfback for Oklahoma.

30:02.322 --> 30:05.586
It was on a Saturday evening, and the rain off and on is a wet evening.

30:06.307 --> 30:07.949
But I believe we beat Oklahoma that night.

30:08.009 --> 30:08.710
It was a great game.

30:09.451 --> 30:16.100
But I never will forget, I didn't get to see much of it because of the harassment I got from the sophomores.

30:16.160 --> 30:20.526
And I guess that

30:20.843 --> 30:26.592
disappointed me and discouraged me about as much as anything was the harassment I went through at football games.

30:27.092 --> 30:29.316
Now, they don't do that kind of stuff today.

30:29.356 --> 30:35.505
Of course, the Corps didn't sit together until recent years again, and that's one thing they lost over the years.

30:36.306 --> 30:41.675
I think you can pretty much go to the football game as a fish in the Corps today and enjoy it.

30:42.376 --> 30:44.859
But it was miserable.

30:45.020 --> 30:48.505
The other way you could now for the road games,

30:48.856 --> 30:53.722
Our home games, if you had a date, that made it a little different too.

30:53.742 --> 30:55.284
But most of us didn't have a date.

30:56.125 --> 30:58.147
But that made things a little different.

30:58.207 --> 31:01.251
But those football games were miserable.

31:01.872 --> 31:05.977
Your freshman year, did you already have an academic major in mind?

31:06.377 --> 31:06.998
Oh, yes.

31:08.099 --> 31:11.303
I had, my older brother was majoring.
