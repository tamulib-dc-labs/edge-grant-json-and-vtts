WEBVTT

00:03.119 --> 00:08.506
Anything like that, if somebody wants you to do it, 
you ought to be willing to do it a little. And so I

00:09.147 --> 00:11.190
told them I'd take it for one term. Well, at the end 
of one term, I had turned it over, but I turned it

00:11.911 --> 00:18.540
over to go into World War II. Because, as you see in 
there, I was a busy man between two wars. What did

00:26.711 --> 00:28.454
you do during the Second World War? Inspected 
kitchens. I went to, I'd gone to Fort Sill, First

00:33.815 --> 00:38.159
World War. They had sent a lot of people out of the, I 
was in the Mississippi New Regiment. It was

00:47.669 --> 00:52.293
regiment, New Artillery Regiment from Louisiana 
and then from Arkansas.

00:58.099 --> 01:03.484
Most of it went there, had no military experience, 
and none whatsoever in artillery. They were, it

01:08.106 --> 01:19.480
was a regiment in all three states where the 
governor said to a friend, you've got a, you're a

01:08.106 --> 01:19.480
lieutenant colonel over here in this infantry 
outfit, go over here, I'll make you a colonel. But

01:21.082 --> 01:22.324
he was an infantryman. Same thing happened in 
Arkansas that did in Mississippi and Louisiana.

01:28.772 --> 01:31.615
They didn't have any, they didn't have any 
artillerymen.

01:34.109 --> 01:47.908
They had people who were foot soldiers that had had 
any military training, and they didn't want to

01:34.109 --> 01:47.908
learn anything else. After we were federalized, 
we met at Clinton, and we stayed over there a few

01:47.948 --> 02:00.285
weeks, where we drilled, and just in infantry 
stuff, but I had some artillery books I was

01:47.948 --> 02:00.285
studying. And then they got us over to Jackson 
where they assembled this Mississippi regiment.

02:07.541 --> 02:11.686
We stayed there for, oh, two months, I guess. We 
paraded every afternoon. These infantrymen were

02:16.432 --> 02:20.317
the people from Jackson who'd come out there and 
see us parade. We'd pass and review, pass and

02:20.397 --> 02:25.463
review, pass and review, march and march and 
march. When we weren't... standing still, we were

02:30.033 --> 02:36.440
marching and when we weren't moving, if there was a 
train on the track, we just marched in place. We

02:38.983 --> 02:40.465
just marched. And we're pretty good paraders now, 
but we didn't know a three, we'd never seen a 75 and

02:40.485 --> 02:54.741
there wasn't but one three-inch battery, the old 
Washington artillery of the world, of

02:56.223 --> 03:00.009
Confederacy was the only battery we had and it just 
shot all over the lot. It was loose. One, one, one

03:02.172 --> 03:07.059
battery for a whole brigade now. For about a month 
or two. And then, and then they sent the majors on

03:08.982 --> 03:16.093
out there and they busted all of them. Then they 
sent a capital two and none of them came back. I mean

03:19.198 --> 03:20.880
for the whole brigade now. Well, I don't know. I 
don't think I volunteered, but I guess I did too

03:23.368 --> 03:27.094
much talking. And so they sent me. And by golly, I 
thought I was going to bust out short because it was

03:31.602 --> 03:36.209
tough. It was fast. Every Saturday we had about 
four or five examinations, 30 minutes. You had to

03:42.658 --> 03:43.660
pass it off. You had to answer a whole lot and write 
and it had to be fast. Well, I'm sure I didn't do too

03:47.166 --> 03:57.103
darn well because every single Sunday morning for 
about six weeks I always went down to look at the

03:47.166 --> 03:57.103
casualty list. They published the casualty list. 
Those that failed, on the exams the previous

04:01.563 --> 04:03.746
Saturday morning. That was published Sunday 
morning with orders to proceed back to your

04:04.447 --> 04:09.014
outfit. Well, when you got back to your outfit, you 
were b-boarded,

04:09.936 --> 04:17.487
which meant give up your commission. And I'd have 
been drafted. And I, oh Lord, I was, I'd say under

04:20.912 --> 04:27.282
pressure. I didn't think I was any better than some 
of the others that were flunking. But thank

04:31.448 --> 04:34.053
goodness I made it. After ten weeks I knew I had it 
made. After six weeks of the ten I knew I had it made.

04:39.583 --> 04:45.674
Well I got back to the brigade, the first one from 
the three regiments that passed that school of

04:39.583 --> 04:45.674
fire. And the old general over there, he didn't 
know any more about artillery than anybody else

04:47.197 --> 04:53.068
because he's real old timer and artillery was 
getting to be a little more technical. You had to

04:58.089 --> 05:05.380
know some trigonometry and had to be able to figure 
out how you could hit something over there and

04:58.089 --> 05:05.380
you're over here and you're looking over yonder. 
And well, I got back and was the first one. And this

05:14.334 --> 05:19.541
old general, he was an old boy, didn't know modern 
stuff. He said, I just don't know anything about

05:20.042 --> 05:26.470
that damn school, but I know it's just running my 
outfit. And I want you to start a school. And I was

05:32.118 --> 05:36.083
his school officer for the balance of the war. And 
we had a school there and I tried to teach them as

05:36.738 --> 05:40.904
much as I could in the time. But then after I'd been 
on that a few weeks, he got orders to send a group of

05:41.625 --> 06:04.737
people over to France, the head of the division, 
the head of the brigade, to go to this French school

05:41.625 --> 06:04.737
to learn about the French 75 and the 155. And I had a 
first sergeant from every battery, three

06:05.071 --> 06:18.108
regiments now, Mississippi, Arkansas, 
Louisiana. I had a first sergeant from every

06:18.148 --> 06:20.832
outfit. I had a second lieutenant from every 
outfit. And he was supposed to be a bright young man

06:25.138 --> 06:34.470
that had maybe been through the French school over 
at, what you call it, and then it'd come back.

06:40.946 --> 06:42.848
And so I had all that bunch of people. We went 
overseas and I remember when we landed at Lahore we

06:43.428 --> 06:53.299
could hear the front, the big guns. That's as near 
as I ever got to firing or receiving any fire in

06:54.380 --> 07:04.811
anger.

07:04.991 --> 07:05.031
So I took this bunch of young officers to this 
school, Equiquidon, that's in Brittany. French

07:16.998 --> 07:19.821
school, artillery school. We went through that 
artillery school and when our regiments came over

07:19.841 --> 07:30.552
there, these officers, there were two to every 
batterer plus me. And so we were ready then to teach

07:31.453 --> 07:34.917
our people stuff. Then we

07:35.808 --> 07:46.444
went and fired and then we went firing and we went. 
We had 70 rounds in our battalion at 11 o'clock on

07:46.464 --> 07:52.874
November 11th. Armistice Day when we got the word 
the truce was signed. And I gave one command. It was

08:02.680 --> 08:08.047
a standing barrage that we shot 70 rounds. That's 
the way we celebrated the armistice. We were just

08:12.714 --> 08:15.217
finishing that morning, that day. At 11 o'clock, 
we shot those 500 rounds. And then there we were.

08:23.569 --> 08:27.094
There's the war over, and we finished the day on our 
train. Well, what are they going to do now? Can't

08:29.620 --> 08:32.524
send everybody, two million people back home the 
same day. And so they give, I don't know what

08:33.285 --> 08:37.129
happened to the other three regiments. I don't 
know what happened to the regiment from Louisiana

08:37.530 --> 08:43.537
or the regiment from Arkansas. But the regiment 
from Mississippi was sent to Valdehan, Valdon,

08:43.557 --> 08:56.473
the way they pronounce it, up near the Swiss 
border, where there was a specialized French

08:43.557 --> 08:56.473
school. on artillery and I mean the arranges and 
things like that for it. We were sent over there and

09:04.153 --> 09:24.520
the old general always had me for his, he always 
made me on every dog gun, I was summer court martial

09:04.153 --> 09:24.520
and a member of a special court and one time I was on a 
general court martial at different places. But we

09:28.921 --> 09:36.940
stayed at Valadol until we got home in July of the 
next summer. firing for that school. Because they

09:41.120 --> 09:43.203
kept an army of occupation. They wanted to offer me 
a job. I was a major, but I'd have to go back as a

09:46.126 --> 09:50.852
captain in the regular army. But I didn't think I 
wanted to be in the army in peacetime. And I wasn't

09:58.701 --> 10:03.387
in the army in peacetime until the Second World War 
came along. And I didn't have to go then. But they

10:06.531 --> 10:07.652
asked me, to report to Fort Sill on August the 4th, 
ever when it was, and I did. And I got up there and

10:19.268 --> 10:25.978
went through the basic course, and I went through 
the field officer's course. There were seven of

10:26.759 --> 10:27.760
us. Probably, they called us the Eagle Squadron,

10:28.722 --> 10:37.234
because we had a bird on our shoulders, you see. 
They don't know what to do with us, because we're

10:38.463 --> 10:41.927
too old to go over. Or if we weren't, we would be in a 
few months. I got to be, I was too old to go over,

10:48.054 --> 10:51.417
because I was already 52. And you couldn't go over 
unless you were a general officer. They'd take you

10:56.403 --> 11:00.187
more than over 52, but that was the cutoff age. And 
those people, those people, I was just more or less

11:01.068 --> 11:07.575
in their way. And we stayed up there though for a 
good many weeks at Fort Sill, heading boards,

11:08.146 --> 11:18.398
investigation boards, and that was all right. And 
then we were on the board that would approve an

11:18.858 --> 11:30.051
enlisted man who wanted to go to officer's 
training camp, and that was all right. And one

11:30.772 --> 11:34.997
time, a boy whose daddy was, the engineer prof 
here, and I was at this time, he was in school now,

11:36.766 --> 11:46.356
I'm back down yonder in the athletic field. No, 
that's what I was a commandant.

11:53.764 --> 11:55.946
No, I guess I'd given up the commandant's job. But 
at least I'm the oldest of this colonel bunch. And

12:00.831 --> 12:04.495
as a result, I'm the chairman of this little thing. 
this little committee. And here comes a boy into

12:06.823 --> 12:12.029
that thing and when he saw me his eyes popped. He was 
a member of my golf team at A&M College. Just before

12:17.496 --> 12:22.723
I left here, my other stuff out there, I was just 
coaching the golf team for the fun of it. And they

12:22.903 --> 12:24.345
taught me a lot of golf. I didn't know any golf. But 
at least I took them on trips and everything like

12:26.308 --> 12:28.751
that. And old Foraker, He's been offered the 
presidency of this school a number of times and

12:31.238 --> 12:35.528
turns it down. He's a big man up at Harvard right 
now. He walked into that thing, because I

12:39.256 --> 12:43.866
recognized him and he recognized me. And I said, oh 
boy, I'm glad to see you. But you don't have to

12:48.256 --> 12:50.361
worry. Because you got it made. You just go back and 
tell them that we're going to give you a favorable

12:53.106 --> 12:57.812
report. I didn't even talk to these other officers 
that are on this committee. And then I'd explain to

13:02.138 --> 13:09.187
them just who this boy is and what I know about him 
and what I know about his daddy. And just a fine

13:09.908 --> 13:12.331
engineer. And he's up at Harvard. He's had a chance 
to come here as president. That was a fun little

13:18.640 --> 13:21.044
story. I was wondering about the changes in the 
Southwest Conference. How's that? The changes in

13:29.136 --> 13:34.425
the Southwest Conference. Have there been major 
changes in the Southwest Conference, do you

13:34.445 --> 13:38.812
think?

13:43.659 --> 13:45.542
I think the Southwest Conference, Of course, the 
coaching profession has progressed a long, long

13:47.682 --> 13:52.368
way. Yeah, could you talk about that? And it 
progressed when the ex-bible came here. We had an

14:01.479 --> 14:05.444
old man by the name of Charlie Moran, famous, 
famous old boy. He coached Center College to a

14:05.464 --> 14:09.949
national championship. You ever heard about 
that? No. Well, they beat Harvard and Harvard was

14:13.130 --> 14:19.197
the best team in the east and the center beat them 
and everybody else that played. They went out and

14:19.737 --> 14:28.487
beat a composite team out on the west coast at a 
Christmas game after winning everything over

14:19.737 --> 14:28.487
here. Then they made a mistake of coming back to 
Dallas and playing Texas A&M on New Year's Day and

14:29.588 --> 14:36.876
we beat them. and that then gave us the claim to 
national championship because that's what they

14:37.987 --> 14:44.556
were and we beat them. Now,

14:46.599 --> 14:54.230
D. X. Bible was the new school.

14:57.294 --> 14:58.476
The man that went to

15:04.075 --> 15:09.283
Wallace Wade was the man that was at that little 
Tennessee prep school in the Desjardins County.

15:09.303 --> 15:10.025
Wallace Wade. He coached at Alabama when our 
present coach was there. He played for Wallace

15:15.013 --> 15:16.255
Wade. And Wallace Wade went from there to 
Vanderbilt, and then he went to Duke where he

15:17.076 --> 15:22.084
stayed, I guess, until he quit. He and Bob were the 
two young coaches that were together in those

15:23.026 --> 15:28.952
adjoining counties in Tennessee. Tennessee in 
those days had very few high schools, but they had

15:29.513 --> 15:39.883
some fine prep schools that had just run by a man who 
had a staff and a building, and he had a prep school.

15:40.844 --> 15:42.385
So those were two prep schools.

15:45.008 --> 15:50.974
Brandon at Shelbyville, Tennessee, and the other 
over at Tallahoma. Now, what did, now... You were

15:52.810 --> 15:58.998
talking about the changes in the Southwest 
Conference. The change was that people started to

15:59.078 --> 16:03.323
recruiting. I see. We took boys that came here. D. 
X. Bobble and I, we'd never had an automobile in

16:09.471 --> 16:16.579
1922, the spring of 22. We stayed here until the 
final parade. And then we got onto a little old car

16:22.325 --> 16:26.891
that we bought for $600 and headed for the west 
coast. We were both Shriners and they were having

16:26.911 --> 16:34.801
the Shrine Convention in San Francisco and so we 
decided to go to it. We'd never been anywhere, we

16:35.522 --> 16:41.690
never had a car or anything like that, but we 
started out and we made it in seven days. And then we

16:42.631 --> 16:44.333
went up the coast. Went to the convention after we 
had already gone down to Mexico and on up the coast

16:45.005 --> 16:51.733
to San Francisco. Then we came back through Patajo 
and Winnemucca and that's in Nevada and then Salt

16:52.333 --> 17:08.151
Lake and then we came around through Colorado and 
came on home. Stayed here about three days. three

17:11.988 --> 17:15.474
or four days just to kind of see how things were 
coming along. Then we head out for Tennessee. He

17:17.418 --> 17:20.523
lives a little above Knoxville and I live on the 
other side of Knoxville. We got to Nashville and

17:21.746 --> 17:25.913
there's a railroad that went from there straight 
to Knoxville, Tennessee Central. It doesn't run

17:25.933 --> 17:27.396
now, but it did then. He caught the train home. I 
gave him $250 for his part of the car. Drove it in. We

17:38.012 --> 17:42.878
had seven fairs between, I had seven fairs between 
here and Sparta, Tennessee. Six of them. Didn't

17:46.783 --> 17:51.649
have many roads, but we didn't stay here and 
recruit. We came here just to be here in time school

17:52.349 --> 17:55.453
started. I never did get here until maybe two days 
before school started every year. Never thought

18:00.700 --> 18:03.443
we were trying to recruit anybody. But these other 
teams got ahead of us while we were coasting along.

18:11.142 --> 18:16.207
And D-X was doing just better than anybody under 
the old deal. But the track wasn't doing too much.

18:22.214 --> 18:28.641
Baseball and basketball and everything like that 
didn't matter, don't matter now to a lot of people.

18:29.902 --> 18:31.624
Football had just got so big. But they're going to 
build us a new stadium. That is, they'll put up some

18:37.858 --> 18:44.049
steel bleachers or something and move the track 
right west of the baseball field. You know where

18:44.731 --> 18:47.937
I'm talking about now. I read in the paper 
yesterday about where they're going to build

18:47.957 --> 18:54.810
three new intramural fields over there and the 
track. I have another question. During the 1960s,

18:57.150 --> 19:07.221
after you retired, A&M of course let women in and 
they also stopped the mandatory corps. So people

19:08.002 --> 19:11.105
did not have to join the corps of cadets. I was 
wondering what you thought of those changes. I

19:14.489 --> 19:15.510
love the corps. I love that uniform. I've put more 
in that uniform than many people. I've had two wars

19:20.716 --> 19:22.078
in it. I love this corps. But I didn't like the 
initiation of this perpetual four-year

19:26.093 --> 19:42.532
fraternity life that was driving the other people 
off and choking the school to death, and nobody's

19:26.093 --> 19:42.532
doing anything about it. I'm the individual that 
challenged this thing and started this ball

19:42.733 --> 19:46.978
rolling. And Gib Gilchrist, my very close friend, 
was here when I was doing it, and he wanted to do what

19:47.638 --> 19:54.987
I... was doing. He was a Texas University man and I 
don't believe that there ever been an A&M man to do

19:56.795 --> 20:04.345
what I did or what he did. Somebody had to come in 
here from somebody else. And not a silly thing,

20:09.212 --> 20:17.903
chasing them off with bore every Friday night once 
a year, was not a silly thing. to do the things they

20:18.997 --> 20:25.286
do to carol from Ann's Barn or take anybody's 
woodpile or just do anything they wanted to do.

20:26.448 --> 20:31.576
Wasn't it a silly thing to make freshmen wait on 
you? Here's another thing they did. Dean Bolton

20:33.138 --> 20:37.605
was a very conservative man. He was in charge of the 
Blue Book. The Blue Book was the rules that the

20:40.769 --> 20:46.658
faculty and the board of directors had adopted to 
take care of discipline and other things in this

20:47.026 --> 20:50.132
college.

20:52.778 --> 21:07.988
I went to,

20:52.778 --> 21:07.988
I guess after the first term in that chair, I went to 
Bing Bolton and I said, Bing Bolton, there's not

20:52.778 --> 21:07.988
any use in them keeping those freshmen in a cage, 
they make them stay right there in the dormitory.

21:13.487 --> 21:14.548
They're in the last class. They can't go to Brown. 
They can't do anything. They have to stay there so

21:16.852 --> 21:22.159
they can wait on the upperclassmen. I said, now 
listen, Dean, let's you and I change that thing.

21:28.729 --> 21:36.760
After a man has passed his December the 10th 
testing age, and he's passing all of his work, Dean

21:28.729 --> 21:36.760
Bolton, Let's make those people give those boys a 
little bit of privilege. Oh, Mr. Edison, let's

21:43.568 --> 21:45.830
just let it alone. Let's just let it alone. All 
right, we let it alone. Next fall, I didn't ask Dean

21:50.435 --> 21:53.938
Bolton anything. I just got out an order. From now 
on out, when that freshman's last class is over

21:57.121 --> 22:03.908
with, he's a free man to call to quarters. He can go 
to town if he wants to. That's revolutionary.

22:10.921 --> 22:13.324
Nobody says I can't do it. The student body doesn't 
like it at all. But there wasn't anybody there with

22:16.408 --> 22:20.433
enough guts to say you can't do that. I forced stuff 
on this college.

22:28.023 --> 22:31.728
I've never told anybody that. But I did force that 
on the senior class. You cannot keep this boy in

22:35.667 --> 22:42.558
quarters just to be there to run your errands and do 
your stuff. He's a free man if he's passing his

22:42.578 --> 22:47.065
grades on December the 10th. I was a reasonable 
person. I cooperated when I was sensible to

22:49.509 --> 22:57.983
cooperate and tried to get a job done that I felt 
like should be done by somebody.

23:00.807 --> 23:01.388
Oh, maybe.

23:04.912 --> 23:08.076
And they weren't too hard to handle. They gave that 
paddle up, just about gave that paddle up. I don't

23:14.824 --> 23:17.186
say that they didn't do it after I left. I don't 
know. I know that they'd better not do too much of it

23:18.107 --> 23:25.076
because Gilchrist wouldn't fool with them. He 
just accepted their resignation and said, we can

23:26.557 --> 23:32.604
get along without you.

23:32.625 --> 23:34.767
And they hadn't done anything to do but swallow it.

23:38.273 --> 23:42.518
I accept your resignation, but you can take the job 
back if you want it. But by golly, I ain't on my

23:42.538 --> 23:45.402
terms. That's what he said. That's what he did. And 
then they, but they forced us to go further than

23:49.827 --> 23:53.072
that. They forced us to go to the state. I went over 
there with him. And the committee from both houses

23:58.899 --> 24:04.686
there asked us questions.

24:08.345 --> 24:13.352
and they told the people over here what was what.

24:20.822 --> 24:35.483
Of course, the darn Korean War

24:20.822 --> 24:35.483
just about ruined military in this country.

24:35.817 --> 24:38.299
Well, it was a damn full war. They shouldn't have 
never gone over there. I used to write Teague every

24:40.041 --> 24:55.035
so often and plead with him, Teague, stand on your 
feet and tell these people over there that they

24:40.041 --> 24:55.035
should have never landed a single man on the 
continent of Asia with a rifle in his hand. If you

24:55.315 --> 25:00.880
want to fight those boys, you've got to be mean 
enough to blow them off the face of the earth and

24:55.315 --> 25:00.880
have it over with. If you don't want to do that, then

25:07.762 --> 25:12.107
I couldn't get him to do that either. But we made a 
terrible mistake going over there. You can't

25:15.851 --> 25:18.634
fight, they're a bunch of red ants. You kill 10 to 
our one, pretty soon we run out of people. And

25:23.480 --> 25:25.022
besides, they fought in the bushes. They never did 
get out and fight like an army. We made a horrible

25:29.367 --> 25:33.111
mistake and just ruined their military As far as 
popularity with the people concerned, they just,

25:35.268 --> 25:42.119
everybody had to be against that war. Except the 
people that got it started and couldn't quit.

25:47.549 --> 25:48.590
Until they finally did. Oh, we're just talking 
about a lot of the stuff that I have lived through.

26:01.913 --> 26:06.100
Had a good time, fine place, wouldn't change it for 
anything in the world. Good wife, good boys,

26:06.741 --> 26:11.469
wonderful boys, two fine sons. Both of them, Rusty 
and my doctor son lives right over there. He lives

26:21.306 --> 26:23.609
in Brown, we live in College Station. Right there 
are those trees that I built up and planted some

26:24.090 --> 26:27.516
time ago. there between us, that's all. He was in 
Arabia last, came back ten days ago. They had him

26:34.940 --> 26:37.624
come over there for thirty days. He's an eye 
specialist. And transplant some corneas and take

26:40.769 --> 26:54.550
out some

26:40.769 --> 26:54.550
lumps out of the eye, what is it, when you have 
cataracts, yeah. Well he did that for thirty days.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.058
just to see what it's like. They paid him well. He's 
just back from it. He came back walking home with

27:04.204 --> 27:12.094
one of those dirt long robes over and a thing over 
his head and a little ring around the top the other

27:04.204 --> 27:12.094
day. And the other boy, the other boy stayed here 
for a couple of years and then he went to Annapolis.

27:19.924 --> 27:22.607
And he was the top man up there. He was the brigade 
captain his senior year and that same cadet

27:23.929 --> 27:28.755
colonel here. So I'm very proud of him. He didn't 
stay in the Air Force or the Navy. I heard he stayed

27:33.511 --> 27:38.738
in there eight years, and then he decided his wife 
didn't like the service. He liked it all right, but

27:39.840 --> 27:44.587
his wife didn't, so he decided just go into 
business. He's with the Southland Corporation up

27:44.627 --> 27:48.072
in Dallas. He does a good job. We had both of them and 
their families in there for food yesterday,

27:50.055 --> 27:57.325
Saturday, Sunday at noon. get them together and we 
got two fine sons. We sure like them. Sure like

28:02.778 --> 28:03.499
them. Sure proud of them.

28:08.006 --> 28:10.650
What do you think of the future of Texas A&M? What do 
you think of the future of Texas A&M? But listen,

28:12.733 --> 28:16.318
there's one other thing I want to say. There's a 
picture of the man that decided that they needed a

28:16.398 --> 28:24.190
marker down there on the track. old Pat Olson, 
Helen standing right there by him. She was the

28:29.373 --> 28:34.139
mother and sponsor of that track team all during 
the years. I don't think I'd ever got too far

28:36.442 --> 28:43.572
without her because she just, she just was just 
nice to those kids and they liked her. She'd feed

28:46.435 --> 28:51.342
them when the year was over and she'd be with them on 
the bus wherever they'd go, here, there, and

28:46.435 --> 28:51.342
yonder. and she's just a great gal.

29:00.415 --> 29:16.497
But the,

29:00.415 --> 29:16.497
I guess

29:00.415 --> 29:16.497
I'm a little bit unique in the fact that I just never 
did leave the place, and in athletics.

29:18.920 --> 29:21.143
Never did, never was fired except I quit. For a few 
hours. And there was fire, never did quit. That's

29:30.904 --> 29:32.746
pretty good for a coach. No kidding. That's an 
accomplishment in itself. Well thanks a lot for

29:38.615 --> 29:40.257
this interview. We'll have it typed up for you.
