WEBVTT

00:01.685 --> 00:10.868
This is all part of the interview format.

00:12.316 --> 00:12.957
Good afternoon. We're in the office of Marvin 
Townsend, city manager of Laredo, Texas. Mr.

00:17.464 --> 00:27.999
Townsend is going to tell us about events in the 
history of planning in Corpus Christi during his

00:17.464 --> 00:27.999
years as city manager of Corpus Christi, Texas.

00:29.802 --> 00:37.874
Mr. Townsend, I started out, as you say, making 
some assumptions about the role of planning in the

00:29.802 --> 00:37.874
management of the city. Do you want to? Well, I 
don't think you can identify and separate

00:40.497 --> 00:49.129
planning from the total staff responsibilities 
of the city. So I don't think we can identify what is

00:49.149 --> 01:02.068
caused by planning versus what comes out of the 
engineering department or what comes out of the

00:49.149 --> 01:02.068
utility programs as they work on growth or the 
staff people responsible for transportation.

01:02.108 --> 01:09.238
It's a team, which the planning responsibility is 
to focus on one part of it. We're talking about a lot

01:09.809 --> 01:12.173
of years now. Where do you want to start that 
process? Well, why don't we start with your

01:13.456 --> 01:19.447
background and how you came to Corpus Christi and 
how you... I know that you worked in the city and

01:19.467 --> 01:22.893
became the city manager. I have a bachelor's 
degree in economics from Cornell University and a

01:22.914 --> 01:29.606
master's degree in public administration from 
Cornell. The master's degree is with a city

01:29.626 --> 01:33.353
management major. And I wasn't a minor, but I had a 
substantial number of planning courses, enough

01:35.003 --> 01:43.736
so that I could have gotten a master's in regional 
planning, except for an eight-hour design

01:35.003 --> 01:43.736
course. So I have been actively involved in 
planning throughout my whole life. I went to

01:47.622 --> 01:50.666
Corpus Christi in 1956 when I graduated from 
college. And I was there until 1982. I was the

01:52.970 --> 02:02.023
assistant city manager beginning in 68. No, 
pardon me. In 60. And the city manager began in 68.

02:05.622 --> 02:15.531
Who was the city manager at the time that you were 
assistant city manager? Herbert Whitney, who

02:15.811 --> 02:19.114
just died two days ago. I had a telephone call. I was 
trying to get straight. It was about his death.

02:28.021 --> 02:32.685
He was city manager from 58 until...

02:33.644 --> 02:34.545
Well, 59 to 68. Now, I

02:34.685 --> 02:47.357
guess all the prior city managers are deceased 
now, because Russian Leclerc, the one before

02:34.685 --> 02:47.357
that, has also passed away.

02:48.618 --> 03:03.212
The city in 56 was about 100 and,

02:48.618 --> 03:03.212
let's see, let me work backwards. I've

03:04.103 --> 03:14.737
forgotten exactly, but it was around 100,000 
population. And square miles was about 37 square

03:14.797 --> 03:17.300
miles. During that process, it's grown by 
annexations and by physical growth to where it's

03:18.682 --> 03:23.027
now. You've got the actual figures, I'm sure, but 
it's over 200 square miles of water and about 130,

03:24.209 --> 03:32.980
140 square miles of water. The area that is water is 
the Corpus Christi Bay. And Uasis Bay. And Uasis

03:38.939 --> 03:40.000
Bay. And just down into the Gulf of Mexico from the 
city of Puerto Angeles down to the national

03:41.301 --> 03:52.932
seashore to protect for offshore drilling, to 
regulate offshore drilling. So they go to Madre as

03:54.194 --> 03:59.399
well as Corpus Christi Bay as well as Uasis Bay. OK. 
So when you started working with the city, let's

03:59.757 --> 04:10.569
see, the comprehensive plan that was adopted by 
the city council was adopted around 53 or 54? Yes,

04:12.791 --> 04:16.495
that was the Bartholomew study, yes. And so where 
was the city government as far as implementing

04:16.936 --> 04:23.983
that when you joined? Had it just about been built 
out? It was a piece of work that was done. in the

04:29.592 --> 04:38.083
56th, and it left a very definite mark on the city, 
but it was basically just a planning document.

04:39.405 --> 04:46.193
There are those, and I imagine the conversation 
with Mr. Anderson probably tied everything that

04:39.405 --> 04:46.193
happened to the city back to that Bartholomew 
plan. Well, I don't find that to be true at all. It

04:48.937 --> 04:57.428
was a growing city, and it is a growing city, and 
they've made accommodations step by step as the

04:48.937 --> 04:57.428
planning process has evolved. But to give you an 
example of The Harlan Bartholomew master plan

05:00.406 --> 05:06.636
called for expanding the present airport. 
Instead, they built a new airport. Well, there are

05:10.782 --> 05:18.954
those who think the plan was followed that says 
that that was all focused because the Bartholomew

05:10.782 --> 05:18.954
plan focused on it. Well, obviously, the 
community was focusing on it, and I don't think

05:18.974 --> 05:23.481
that's really even the same solution.

05:27.207 --> 05:27.508
Yes. Thank you. Yes, Louise. OK, here we go again. 
Well, there's no doubt that the expressway plan

05:35.697 --> 05:40.802
was a very major change. But see, that wasn't in the 
Bartholomew plan in 53 and 54. Well, yeah, because

05:43.765 --> 05:49.371
that was a response to things that occurred later. 
I'm just trying to say, though, that to identify a

05:49.391 --> 06:01.243
master plan and say that it caused all these things 
or it was the major reason for all these things,

05:49.391 --> 06:01.243
it's just a step in the evolution of the city. Well, 
what parts of the growth of the city do you think had

06:01.493 --> 06:12.807
to do with the comprehensive plan at the time that 
you were first working in the city? Well, see, I'm

06:12.947 --> 06:18.334
not trying to suggest that having a plan is not an 
important part of the process. And it's constant

06:18.354 --> 06:19.636
update. But I mean, the 53 plan did not become the

06:19.656 --> 06:27.726
foundation stone for much of anything. It became a 
point of departure for all these things. It

06:31.632 --> 06:33.978
certainly did a good job in bringing things 
together. Now, one thing it did do, for sure, it was

06:34.078 --> 06:46.047
the immediate catalyst to the correction of the 
railroad problem, which led to the construction

06:34.078 --> 06:46.047
of the harbor bridge and the Tule Lake lift bridge. 
That was a very major change, and I think that

06:46.432 --> 07:05.658
probably was kicked off by the Area Development 
Committee's participation in that master plan

06:46.432 --> 07:05.658
report, because it set up a technical committee, 
and that technical committee involved people

06:46.432 --> 07:05.658
from the Navigation District, which was the port, 
and the county, and the city, and the railroads,

06:46.432 --> 07:05.658
and others. And they did work carefully together 
to bring that very major change, which other

07:06.018 --> 07:14.209
things might not have followed had that not been 
true. But even there, it was a major variation. At

07:17.009 --> 07:20.874
one point, the plan talked about a tunnel, and it 
turned out to be a bridge. These are rather

07:21.494 --> 07:22.776
substantial changes. But I think it very clearly 
caused that to happen. Now, the rest of it, there

07:27.942 --> 07:37.794
was underway reservoir studies then, and a dam was 
constructed shortly after the report was

07:27.942 --> 07:37.794
prepared. But the studies that were ongoing for 
that dam were built into the report. So it's the

07:42.980 --> 07:45.143
planning process. It involves all of the 
departments, as well as planning as a

07:45.275 --> 07:51.262
coordinating vehicle. Now, when Bill was there, 
Bill Anderson, he was the secretary to the

07:51.282 --> 08:00.111
technical committee, and he was right in the 
middle of these various actions. And he was

08:01.112 --> 08:07.059
actively involved in the construction of the 
first reservoir, the expanded reservoir, Lake

08:01.112 --> 08:07.059
Corpus Christi. Now, which one is Lake Corpus 
Christi? OK. It's the same reservoir that was the

08:08.981 --> 08:15.248
old lake, but a new dam was built, which is Wesley 
Seal Dam, in front of the old reservoir. and

08:15.464 --> 08:17.627
flooded the old reservoir. And the creation of the 
water district made that possible. But see, when

08:19.710 --> 08:24.998
the water district was created then, that's the 
Lower Illinois Superior Water Supply District,

08:19.710 --> 08:24.998
it was larger than the city. And today, it doesn't 
represent a third of the city, because it has not

08:26.460 --> 08:34.733
grown as the city's annexed and grown. So the 
process of orderly growth, the process of having

08:35.514 --> 08:41.843
good subdivision regulations, I think that's 
been a very important contribution to planning,

08:42.042 --> 08:46.949
is having subdivision regulations and then 
living with them. I think that's been a very

08:48.971 --> 09:00.887
important part, that the subdivisions are 
basically laid out well, that there are arterial

08:48.971 --> 09:00.887
streets laid out, that there is a program of curb 
and gutter and sidewalks, and the city has gone

08:48.971 --> 09:00.887
into old areas and rebuilt them. I was very much 
concerned to tie the reconstruction of the city

09:01.588 --> 09:06.555
and the planning of the city together. I think 
historically too many planning departments have

09:07.897 --> 09:10.260
been able to handle new growth and laying out 
subdivisions such as this, but really can't come

09:10.628 --> 09:30.787
to grips with the reconstruction of a city, 
housing programs, rehabilitation of old

09:10.628 --> 09:30.787
streets, and putting in utilities, and payment 
assessment programs, and the kind of hard work

09:10.628 --> 09:30.787
that you have to go through to rejuvenate an old 
neighborhood. So you saw that there was not only

09:30.807 --> 09:40.416
planning for new growth in the city, but going back 
into the existing city and bringing it up to date.

09:40.649 --> 09:51.929
And I, in fact, bought community development 
under planning about

09:40.649 --> 09:51.929
1969 or 70.

09:52.310 --> 09:58.982
There were ordinances for subdivision 
development in the city charter? No, the charter

10:00.084 --> 10:02.889
is just a foundation stone. The council has to 
adopt ordinances. And those ordinances are

10:05.557 --> 10:19.667
adopted into law under the state platting law, 
which I believe is 964 , which says that whenever a

10:05.557 --> 10:19.667
piece of land is divided into two or more parts, The 
person divided has to file a plat, and that plat has

10:19.951 --> 10:23.975
to comply with the city's ordinances. And that 
plat must show the streets being laid out and the

10:24.456 --> 10:27.699
utilities being dedicated. It must show how all of 
the services of the public are going to be

10:27.719 --> 10:33.365
provided, and you have to have access to it. Well, 
most cities in Corpus Christi had an ordinance

10:33.966 --> 10:47.160
that went well beyond that and spelled out in great 
detail the construction standards and how you had

10:33.966 --> 10:47.160
to build sidewalks and you had to provide fibers 
under your acreage for parks and set up a lot of

10:33.966 --> 10:47.160
other requirements. You had to put in sanitary 
sewers and storm sewers When was that? Oh, I think

10:51.103 --> 10:57.632
Bill Anderson was probably responsible for the 
first one, or the first comprehensive one. I guess

10:57.652 --> 10:58.853
there was one even before that. And I imagine that 
the first comprehensive platinum ordinance was

10:59.354 --> 11:04.961
probably adopted in the middle 50s. Middle 50s? 
OK. They had one before that. But I mean, I think the

11:08.665 --> 11:17.937
standards were brought up to far, or brought up to 
more acceptable levels in the middle 50s. And was

11:18.440 --> 11:19.702
that ever updated? Oh, yes. Is that updated 
continually? Yeah, that's right. It's been

11:23.870 --> 11:25.853
changed a lot since then. And what part of the, 
would that be part of the planning department?

11:31.723 --> 11:32.545
Yeah, the planning department. And what part, I 
realize that the planning department in Corpus

11:32.625 --> 11:35.270
Christi. Oh, that's normally called current 
planning, but it was, back to the days we're

11:35.290 --> 11:41.040
talking about it, it was the planning department. 
Right. The old planning department was only,

11:41.741 --> 11:43.384
yeah. Bill Anderson, Bob Burr, and I guess Earl 
Getz was there. I guess there were about maybe five

11:50.194 --> 11:55.506
people, six people at most. That was in the 
mid-50s? Yeah. Okay. And so then... At some time in

12:03.783 --> 12:18.973
the mid-60s, or 1974, maybe we're jumping ahead, 
but in 74, you reorganized the...

12:19.865 --> 12:23.511
Offices of the city manager and the deputies. Yes, 
yeah. Well, there was once in 74 and once in 80 are

12:26.276 --> 12:31.244
the two dates that I've got. So you were there. 
Yeah, I guess that's correct. What do you think?

12:34.950 --> 12:35.591
Oh, I don't know. The days kind of fall together. 
You said 70? 74 was one date that I've got. I guess

12:42.743 --> 12:43.464
that's right. I guess I brought... Yeah, we set up 
the Department of Planning and Urban Development

12:46.814 --> 12:51.138
in the 74. That was probably right. And included 
under planning community development and

12:53.060 --> 13:01.148
planning and something else. I guess we separated 
current planning and long-range planning. And

13:07.094 --> 13:08.476
then the change in 80, 81? 80, I think. My date was 
80. Then we changed it, and we created a position of

13:15.097 --> 13:18.621
assistant city manager. The assistant city 
manager took the place of the director of planning

13:19.022 --> 13:23.207
and urban development. And under that assistant 
city manager, other functions were placed, which

13:23.888 --> 13:38.286
included park and recreation, which included the 
library, which

13:23.888 --> 13:38.286
included I guess that's it. And there are other 
city managers established, assistant city

13:42.390 --> 13:48.238
managers established at the same time. So that 
basically we had everybody in the city reporting

13:48.838 --> 13:56.208
to either one of the three assistant city managers 
or to the deputy city manager or directly to me. It

13:56.448 --> 13:59.412
was set up so eventually there would have been a 
fourth assistant city manager. There isn't now.

14:00.493 --> 14:03.457
It's presently operating with three assistant 
city managers. One of those is now. Well, the

14:06.886 --> 14:12.973
deputy manager is now Ernest Briones,

14:06.886 --> 14:12.973
who was the... He didn't go through assistant city 
manager. He moved up from director of planning and

14:15.976 --> 14:22.724
urban development

14:15.976 --> 14:22.724
to deputy manager. What were you hoping to

14:23.304 --> 14:35.458
gain, improve, increase in terms of changing the 
organization or developing the organization

14:23.304 --> 14:35.458
even more? Well, there's two changes in that 
process. One was the matter of the city manager's

14:39.153 --> 14:52.405
span of control being much too large, having some, 
I guess, 18 people, probably 20 people, no, I guess

14:39.153 --> 14:52.405
18, something like that, reporting directly to 
the city manager. The other, the earlier change,

14:52.846 --> 15:00.433
bringing community development and planning 
together, was to make more realistic current

14:52.846 --> 15:00.433
planning. Here you had the community development 
program, which I forgot now what the money was, but

15:00.453 --> 15:05.918
$3 or $4 million a year. That process of planning 
really wasn't even tied in with the so-called

15:06.725 --> 15:12.836
physical planning of the city. And the planners 
really weren't very practical people in terms of

15:12.856 --> 15:18.986
making things happen. And I felt that that tie 
needed to be made. We needed to relate housing and

15:23.514 --> 15:29.745
zoning to what's happening out on the street. It 
doesn't do any good to be concerned about the

15:30.232 --> 15:39.365
zoning and not be concerned about the condition of 
the housing, or the trash on the street, or the

15:30.232 --> 15:39.365
abandoned cars living on property. Just because 
the book says the zoning is right doesn't mean that

15:39.426 --> 15:46.716
the living conditions have been corrected. It's 
all got to be tied together. And so I felt that the

15:48.879 --> 15:56.070
current planning needed to be tied into the 
community development planning, that it had to be

15:48.879 --> 15:56.070
all the same process.

15:59.341 --> 16:07.072
I think that's always been my concern about 
planners generally is that they don't seem to

15:59.341 --> 16:07.072
understand that a plan is no good unless you carry 
it out. Right, the implementation. When you can't

16:08.634 --> 16:11.558
carry it out, it's in a planning department 
someplace. You've got to mix with the operating

16:12.819 --> 16:20.149
people and revise the plans to be realistic and 
then carry them out. If they don't get carried out,

16:21.071 --> 16:22.733
they don't do any good. And that's still basically 
the problem. For somebody to sit around and draw up

16:26.061 --> 16:36.695
goals programs or draw up plans or draw up master 
plans without the ability to implement those

16:26.061 --> 16:36.695
plans and without the organizational ability is 
just hot air. Okay. What are some of the things that

16:37.817 --> 16:45.748
you feel were implemented that were most 
important to the growth of Corpus Christi? Say,

16:45.968 --> 16:52.237
when you first went in as assistant city manager, 
start there. I mean, the things that We know that

16:53.982 --> 16:59.107
Bill left off about the highways and the 
transportation and the port. I guess whatever you

16:59.347 --> 17:06.834
saw is important because, right, a plan is a piece 
of paper, but what was the implementation that

16:59.347 --> 17:06.834
really affected the purpose? For a long while, 
three of the things that were very important to us

17:06.854 --> 17:16.563
was a long-term water supply, which we 
accomplished with the construction of Choke

17:06.854 --> 17:16.563
Canyon, if it ever rains in that part of the 
country. Well, it sure hasn't in a while. The

17:18.985 --> 17:20.227
reservoir is almost empty. 120 million dollars 
worth of reservoir. And a second big... A need was

17:23.024 --> 17:34.009
the need to build a convention facility so that the 
city could more actively enter into the

17:23.024 --> 17:34.009
convention business, which we accomplished on 
the Bayfront, finally, after several false

17:23.024 --> 17:34.009
starts. Another was the development of Crookston 
Beach. which have been allowed to become almost a

17:37.435 --> 17:39.998
slum. Several hurricanes and a lot of hard work. We 
got cleaned up pretty much. And we plan to go for it

17:44.083 --> 17:45.645
now. It's pretty much... Is that North Beach or the 
beach in front of the Coliseum? North Beach. Okay,

17:50.531 --> 17:50.951
North Beach. But that's called Cochise Beach. 
That's the correct name for it. South Beach is

17:56.758 --> 17:59.101
called E Beach. I think we accomplished... 
Looking back, the development of Ocean Drive was a

18:01.651 --> 18:07.138
major project during that period of time. What 
kind of street should it be, and the fact that we

18:07.879 --> 18:13.888
decided to have a median, and the fact that we 
developed some big parks simultaneously to it.

18:13.908 --> 18:17.352
See, for instance, Cole Park and Swanton Park, 
those didn't exist. We pushed the seawall out in

18:18.093 --> 18:22.920
the water and then filled in behind them, along the 
part of the street, technically. Those two parks

18:22.980 --> 18:24.902
were built as part of the street. They had a seawall 
someplace, so we said, why not put it out in the

18:25.403 --> 18:28.367
water? get as much material as we can. In fact, we 
dredged in behind coal and we dredged in behind

18:29.994 --> 18:36.143
slander as well as hauling a lot of material. 
Right. I remember Coal Park prior to the ocean

18:36.303 --> 18:38.286
drive. It's just that little block that used to 
fall off. Yeah, yeah. Well now, that was solely a

18:41.851 --> 18:45.696
city program? Was it at all involved in... 
Preserving the open space. We got federal funds to

18:49.522 --> 18:52.085
buy the open space. It's always intrigued me. We 
had to back off a couple pieces, because they were

18:55.600 --> 18:59.263
partially developed out in the water. They were 
also owned by some very influential people. But I

19:02.106 --> 19:04.168
think the main reason was that they were partly 
developed. There was improvements on the water

19:04.188 --> 19:07.131
side. Mrs. Sam Wilson, right there at the 
Doddridge or Weber and the Ocean Drive. Yeah. So

19:14.538 --> 19:16.360
owned by somebody else now. properties, which are 
out there right by Sauna Park. Just before you get

19:18.962 --> 19:20.604
to it, there's two or four houses enrolled. You got 
some finger piers down there. And a house that's

19:22.425 --> 19:25.168
become. a lot of controversy here up here of late 
that one house that's on the water side after you

19:25.908 --> 19:51.139
passed the Baptist Church yeah yeah Mr. Henry 
Stewart owned it and that was taken out of the

19:25.908 --> 19:51.139
project and even then we just got to approve about 
four to three votes uh by city council yeah now if

19:25.908 --> 19:51.139
you go back and ask those councilmen about that 
project all think it's wonderful nobody

19:25.908 --> 19:51.139
remembers voting against it well what were some of 
their uh objections well buying buying the last

19:51.338 --> 19:59.309
piece of waterfront available for private 
development, and that people who bought those

19:51.338 --> 19:59.309
lots ought to be able to develop them, et cetera. 
See, the statement in bought, for what today is

19:59.689 --> 20:10.644
peanuts, I think the whole project wasn't over, 
I've forgotten the figure, but I think it was over

19:59.689 --> 20:10.644
$400,000, $500,000. Bought. That's amazing. 
Every strip of land that was as much as 1,000 foot in

20:12.988 --> 20:17.734
a row, And that's how Doddridge Park, the city had a 
little piece of land at Doddridge Park, but

20:17.917 --> 20:23.964
expanded to Doddridge Park or wherever. 
Expanded, bought Swantler Park. Swantler was one

20:27.008 --> 20:30.772
of these places like Cole Park where it just fell 
off right at the edge of the road. And bought that

20:31.533 --> 20:36.499
whole strip from the Baptist Church in the town. 
Now some of it had to be bought because the old Ocean

20:36.999 --> 20:45.409
Drive was so narrow that in putting down the new 
Ocean Drive, it had to have some support. And so the

20:45.693 --> 20:52.291
tracks had to be purchased because there was such a 
large portion of them being purchased anyway that

20:45.693 --> 20:52.291
we felt, why not buy the whole thing? But we did 
successfully carry that out and that certainly

20:53.154 --> 20:57.526
has had a big impact. Obviously the sewer plants 
had to be planned and built. And that worked quite

21:00.965 --> 21:09.194
well, even though now it's become quite a problem, 
because it had some monumental problems with some

21:00.965 --> 21:09.194
of the contractors. And that sewer plant is 
located? Sewer plants, they're all over it. OK,

21:14.560 --> 21:16.943
I'm familiar with one over by Cuyahoga. Yeah, it's 
called Cuyahoga. That's the largest now. But the

21:20.627 --> 21:28.356
Broadway, what was the largest, which is right 
downtown on the edge of the ship channel, the west

21:20.627 --> 21:28.356
side is on Saratoga and Greenwood. And then 
there's the Allison plants out by West Goose Park

21:29.602 --> 21:35.951
out in Annabelle. Right. And there's

21:36.732 --> 21:41.559
two on the far above. There's one on Padre Island. 
So all those have developed. In 56, there were two

21:46.346 --> 21:50.112
sewer plants. When was the decision to go ahead 
and, or was there a time when there was a decision to

21:50.733 --> 21:57.803
go ahead and add new sewer plants into the city 
growth? Well, throughout the whole process. Like

22:02.560 --> 22:11.530
I say, the one out of Saratoga, which was the third 
sewer plant built, called the Westside, was built

22:02.560 --> 22:11.530
in the 50s, 60s, 60s. We had one along through 
there. And the fourth one was the Allison plant out

22:13.593 --> 22:18.238
by Westwood Park. And then the fifth and sixth ones 
were at Florida Bluff. And the seventh out of

22:21.061 --> 22:22.963
Allen. Annexation has been a very important part 
of Corpus Christi. Were it not for annexation, it

22:31.232 --> 22:37.007
would be just a new city with much better traffic 
right now. And that started back in 54 when they had

22:37.027 --> 22:40.395
the first, well really, I think Billy Anderson 
went to Corpus Christi to, one of the purposes was

22:40.595 --> 22:48.905
to straighten out the boundaries, in other words, 
to carry out the first annexation there. I don't

22:48.925 --> 22:52.129
mean the first, but there was a substantial 
annexation in 54 and 55. And then we carried out a

22:52.990 --> 23:00.839
big one in 61, and that's when Flower Bluff was 
annexed, and then Count Allen and H. Willis Midway

22:52.990 --> 23:00.839
was annexed. And that caused a lot of grief. Where 
did he live there? Up until 70. OK. I'm sure you've

23:08.152 --> 23:10.575
heard a lot about the . And then, because those were 
so large, then there were just a bunch of filling

23:10.615 --> 23:18.444
annexations for the next decade. But of course, 
now the annexations are gradually going forward

23:18.464 --> 23:31.119
until they include a substantial part of Padre 
Island now, mostly developed area of Padre Island

23:18.464 --> 23:31.119
inside the city, as well as the area out the 
Orangeville Highway, which is out west of

23:18.464 --> 23:31.119
Calhoun. Right. When did the annexation start? at 
Padre Island beginning in the 70s or late? Well,

23:38.766 --> 23:39.947
Flora Bluff was annexed in 61. OK, Flora Bluff. Was 
annexed in 61. And then the causeway was annexed as

23:41.288 --> 23:45.212
part of Laguna Madre. You see, the whole of Laguna 
Madre was annexed to control oil and gas

23:45.232 --> 23:49.916
exploration. It would require storm shoulders. 
It would require spacing so that the would be too

23:51.297 --> 23:53.900
close together. It would require that the 
platform be a certain distance off the shore and

23:54.300 --> 23:57.443
such as this. And then the first Padre Island 
annexation happened in the 80s. So

24:05.678 --> 24:12.244
that's been very recent. Yeah. That's just about . 
We were having a public meeting . OK. Same with the

24:20.552 --> 24:22.233
Orange Grove Highway. Now, you understand what I 
mean by that? You know where Calhoun is? Yeah.

24:28.179 --> 24:30.200
Well, this is on west of Calhoun. Right. Yeah. As a 
matter of fact, I just drove that highway

24:32.242 --> 24:35.145
yesterday. Coming here? Yeah, coming in this way. 
Okay, that's not the fastest way. That's all

24:39.879 --> 24:40.540
right. Where are you coming from? Well, I was 
coming from College Station. Oh, all right. Well,

24:45.666 --> 24:47.708
I always take a different route. That's okay. So I 
went through Tynan and Orange Grove on towards

24:48.930 --> 24:52.814
Alice. And the Orange Grove Highway is 181? No. 
Coming into Corpus Christi? No, that's the beach

25:00.764 --> 25:03.407
highway. 624. Okay. Yeah.

25:08.291 --> 25:08.631
Thank you. Carlos? Okay, where were we? Well, I 
want to ask you about, you talked about the

25:12.915 --> 25:27.608
reconstruction in the internal part of the city, 
and I want to ask you about the attitudes towards

25:12.915 --> 25:27.608
urban renewal in Corpus Christi, because I 
understood that there weren't any federal urban

25:12.915 --> 25:27.608
renewal. Yeah, urban renewal kind of was an idea 
whose time came and went. Now, how it would have

25:31.071 --> 25:34.714
changed the city, had the city taken advantage of 
it, I don't know, looking back, I mean, maybe we

25:35.555 --> 25:40.380
would have gotten some neighborhoods restored 
earlier. The big problem with urban renewal was

25:40.420 --> 25:43.704
clearance. And who knows now what would have 
happened if the election in 1959 had passed. I've

25:51.873 --> 25:53.114
forgotten the date of the second election. Which 
election was that? Well, the first urban renewal

25:53.655 --> 25:55.337
election was in 59. In Corpus Christi? Yes. Okay, 
that was like... A city-wide bond. Right. It

26:00.732 --> 26:02.555
failed, I think, four to one or something like 
that. Well, no, in Texas, in order to have urban

26:02.615 --> 26:05.679
renewal, you had to have voter approval. You had to 
take the concept, not the project, but the concept

26:05.719 --> 26:09.844
to the voters. And then we went back to the voters 
again in 19, and I have to check the date. I would

26:16.593 --> 26:20.578
guess 67, 8, 9, 6, someplace along there. And it 
failed the I guess the first one failed four and a

26:22.872 --> 26:26.036
half to one, and the second one failed four to one. 
It was enough so that I said to my wife, at this rate,

26:26.916 --> 26:31.201
we have to have nine more elections before it'll 
pass. It was the kind of thing where all the

26:32.463 --> 26:41.192
so-called good guys in town were in favor of it, the 
Chamber of Commerce, all the civic clubs, but it

26:32.463 --> 26:41.192
still failed that badly. Of course, the reason was 
that you can't pass something on a concept. I

26:45.317 --> 26:51.664
remember one old man, I talked to him for an hour, 
but he'd been given a map by the opposition And the

26:52.437 --> 26:55.683
map was the map of the area of substandard housing. 
He'd been told in that meeting by the opposition

26:56.985 --> 27:02.095
that if your house was in the gray area, it went. 
Clearance, total clearance. And even though this

27:05.441 --> 27:11.492
guy had a lot of respect for me, and we talked for an 
hour, at the end he said, but Marvin, my house is in

27:05.441 --> 27:11.492
the gray area. And that was the story of urban 
renewal in Purpose 50. To me, that one little

27:15.360 --> 27:18.203
comment just tells it all. I mean, it never passed 
because the lies were so easy to make and the

27:18.223 --> 27:25.651
program based upon philosophy could never pass. 
What did you say the advantages would have been to

27:26.372 --> 27:29.375
the city? Well, like the project that was the first 
proposed project took the oldest part of the city

27:29.515 --> 27:41.547
in a very rundown park called the, some called it 
the Cut, basically the area between the

27:29.515 --> 27:41.547
expressway and the Broadway and adjacent to the 
sewer plant and back over to Port Avenue. Right.

27:45.996 --> 27:50.620
And converted that into a complete redevelopment 
area. Now, what do you need, Bob? I just wanted to

27:53.723 --> 27:56.826
know, are we playing games with the court 
tomorrow? Tax cases? Gosh, I don't know. What

28:00.089 --> 28:01.050
cases are set tomorrow? I thought you might know. 
I'll call one of the lawyers and ask them. Flo

28:05.895 --> 28:06.836
should be around. Is he in the tax office? I haven't 
checked. Oh. I always love the Uber. OK. That's

28:11.886 --> 28:13.128
fine. OK. Ah, where was I? OK, so the first project 
for urban renewal was proposed for that area,

28:15.631 --> 28:26.045
between Rob and I. Yeah, in what later became the 
Coles High Alco area. And I don't know what would

28:27.046 --> 28:30.611
happen if it had been approved. The concept was 
almost total clearance. It was going to be

28:32.794 --> 28:39.563
redeveloped with some apartments and some single 
family housing around the cemetery and some

28:32.794 --> 28:39.563
existing churches. They're still now, 25 years 
later, working in that same neighborhood with CD

28:40.370 --> 28:48.098
money. And finally got, well, I haven't been back, 
but I think all the streets are now reconstructed.

28:53.243 --> 28:57.867
And there's still some pretty bad slums in that 
neighborhood, though. And after a renewal went

28:57.887 --> 29:09.178
down the second time, a 221 project, which is a 
housing project owned by a nonprofit

28:57.887 --> 29:09.178
corporation, but still basically,

28:57.887 --> 29:09.178
well, it's A lot of people have Section 8 housing 
assistance grants to let them live there. But they

29:15.265 --> 29:28.883
went in with the city's cooperation that bought 
the worst four blocks in the slums and built a

29:15.265 --> 29:28.883
cooperative project with the St. Matthew's 
Baptist Church acting as one of the key sponsors

29:15.265 --> 29:28.883
for it. So I don't know whether it would have 
changed dramatically. I'm sure that those kind of

29:30.605 --> 29:36.853
things would have happened a lot faster with urban 
renewal because it would have been a get in, get out

29:30.605 --> 29:36.853
kind of thing. I know that some of the projects now 
where they're working on the city hall site, for

29:37.222 --> 29:51.332
instance, and the courthouse site, those tracks 
might well have been bought and cleared quickly

29:37.222 --> 29:51.332
with urban renewal, and maybe those improvements 
could have been built ten years ago. That's what

29:51.582 --> 29:56.329
would have happened there, and maybe the city hall 
and courthouse would be being built someplace

29:51.582 --> 29:56.329
else. I don't particularly agree with where the 
city hall is being built. In fact, I think it's

30:00.474 --> 30:01.876
wrong. So it's who knows what the right solution 
would have been. But all of those things evolve as

30:08.485 --> 30:15.515
the city grows, and there's no one process. To me, 
the process of planning is to be at the front in that

30:19.274 --> 30:28.227
evolving and to see that in fact as much 
information as is possible goes into the process

30:19.274 --> 30:28.227
and not a bunch of off-the-cuff opinions. A lot of 
planners think that because they're a planner

30:29.529 --> 30:37.400
they can make some grandiose comment about 
something and it's supposed to be good because

30:29.529 --> 30:37.400
they say it's good. And if they can't support what 
they're saying then their views are no different

30:38.181 --> 30:42.227
than the man on the street. The planner's got to be 
prepared and put hard, logical reasoning behind

30:43.388 --> 30:50.999
what he says, and then help that department head 
carry it out. Right. So one of your major concerns

30:52.381 --> 31:00.874
is how do you get a plan off the paper into the actual 
construction? Yeah, and the actual

31:00.914 --> 31:03.758
construction, and the other way around, too. 
Thank you, ma'am.

31:21.307 --> 31:25.554
Well, how did the city approach the 
reconstruction then in the older parts? Was there

31:26.015 --> 31:27.678
a plan? I mean, in a plan, what was the method for 
approaching that reconstruction? Well, the

31:31.144 --> 31:39.718
difference between urban renewal and non-urban 
renewal is the difference between massive reuse

31:31.144 --> 31:39.718
of land versus rehabilitation of existing uses. 
Urban renewal lets you go in and clear so you can

31:40.840 --> 31:44.867
rearrange street patterns. And you could regroup 
the properties. You didn't have to accept the

31:49.923 --> 31:52.145
subdivisions as they were laid out. You could 
start over again. So without that, you have to go

31:54.048 --> 31:56.030
about it the other way. You have to go in and 
rehabilitate it as it sits. So there are still some

31:58.894 --> 32:04.581
land use problems in Corpus Christi that will 
never be solved by current techniques. There's a

32:05.682 --> 32:10.568
little subdivision off of Port Avenue called 
Industrial Boulevard. There's another one

32:10.750 --> 32:22.381
that's, I've forgotten the name of it, but it runs 
off of the port at the curb, runs back toward Agnes,

32:10.750 --> 32:22.381
where you have a tough mix of industrial uses and 
single-family houses. It's surrounded by a

32:22.401 --> 32:35.474
cement plant, or it was a cement plant on one side, I 
think it's probably vacant now, railroad track at

32:22.401 --> 32:35.474
the other side, and a great big cotton compress on 
the third side, and Port Avenue on the fourth side.

32:35.494 --> 32:38.817
It's only three lots deep, and four lots deep 
maybe, and probably have 200 lots in all together.

32:42.444 --> 32:48.190
That is a tough land use problem that all the 
rehabilitation money in the world will probably

32:42.444 --> 32:48.190
never really solve. At some time, maybe the 
private uses will buy it out and turn it into all

32:49.452 --> 32:54.537
industry. But right now, it's home for a lot of 
people, and they've lived there for years, and yet

32:55.238 --> 33:00.804
there's slums. So that's the kind of land use 
problem that without the tools of urban renewal,

33:01.485 --> 33:06.390
it's kind of hard to solve. But many other 
subdivisions have been solved very nicely.

33:08.817 --> 33:22.915
Molina, behind the golf center, was a slum partly 
because of the influence of Cliff Moss Airfield,

33:08.817 --> 33:22.915
which was the old airport, and partly because it 
was a poor neighborhood in a very poor area. It was

33:23.536 --> 33:30.124
kind of a poor school district that was largely 
controlled by the farmers and the ranchers. Do you

33:30.144 --> 33:31.826
know where Molina was? Do you know where Horn Road 
is? Yeah. Well, Horn Road is now between the Golf

33:35.176 --> 33:38.822
Center and Molina. It used to be between the 
airport and Molina. But Molina in 56 had some dirt

33:41.405 --> 33:49.638
roads, no curb and gutter, standing ditches, no 
drainage, no sewer. So it was little two inch water

33:49.658 --> 33:53.284
lines or even smaller. And the city went in there 
and completely redid that subdivision. Built big

33:58.911 --> 34:25.821
storm sewers, big open concrete channels that run 
all the way to Oso Creek to drain it, and then put in

33:58.911 --> 34:25.821
sanitary sewers that ran down to the sewer plant I 
was telling you about before, the west side plant,

33:58.911 --> 34:25.821
and then went in with the two basics done 
underground, went in and replaced the water lines

33:58.911 --> 34:25.821
and replaced the gas lines and put in pavement with 
curb and gutter, and went in at the same time with

33:58.911 --> 34:25.821
what's called concentrated code enforcement, 
where HUD loans were available as well as city

34:26.088 --> 34:38.916
loans to rehabilitate the houses and get rid of the 
privies and connect the people to city sewer as

34:26.088 --> 34:38.916
well as improve their houses. So it was a combined 
effort, and it's been quite successful. If you

34:42.176 --> 34:55.294
look at Molina now, it's nowhere near, it's still 
not probably not the place you'd pick to live, but I

34:42.176 --> 34:55.294
mean it's basically a subdivision of controlled 
land use, and most of the houses are now up to

34:42.176 --> 34:55.294
standard. And that's not just, I'm picking 
Molina, but it was true in Gardendale. You know

35:01.137 --> 35:02.340
Gardendale? Probably. I'm not sure. Gardendale 
went from Staples to Everhart. Okay, yeah. The

35:09.399 --> 35:10.843
roads are... Betty Jean, and Nelson, and Burton, 
and Williams Drive. Anyway, they run it from the

35:22.409 --> 35:29.018
railroad track back to Blanche Moore's property. 
You know that big track on Padre Island Drive

35:29.038 --> 35:37.388
that's undeveloped from Everhart to Staples? And 
Blanche Moore's school sits on the other side of

35:37.408 --> 35:39.391
it? Well, that's Gardendale. That whole side of it 
is back there. Around the 50s, Gardenville had no

35:41.553 --> 35:48.185
sewer, had little two-inch water lines, had open 
ditches on both sides of the streets. Some of the

35:48.766 --> 35:55.458
streets were in very bad shape, had bad gas lines, 
very huge stop signs, very huge street lights. And

35:56.139 --> 35:59.966
Reed did the whole subject. Got the property 
owners to participate on the sewer lines and make

35:59.986 --> 36:06.497
connections to the sewer system. And Gardendale 
is now almost a standard subdivision. In fact, of

36:10.886 --> 36:26.470
course, there was other factors involved with 
Gardendale, because you had tremendously

36:10.886 --> 36:26.470
expensive improvements around it, which just 
kind of made those big lots in Gardendale also

36:10.886 --> 36:26.470
quite advantageous for the person that wanted 
some space, but couldn't afford to buy a big lot in

36:10.886 --> 36:26.470
Country Club. So all those things were happening, 
and I think that basically through the 50s and 60s,

36:33.427 --> 36:41.876
the 60s maybe, and the 70s, the city got rid of many, 
many, many problems that had existed in the World

36:33.427 --> 36:41.876
War II development. In terms of the physical 
layout of the city and the services that the city

36:42.257 --> 36:47.562
could provide for its residents. Yeah, the 
standard of housing, the standard of support for

36:47.582 --> 36:59.215
the people who lived there, the basic 
fundamentals, park improvements, water and

36:47.582 --> 36:59.215
sewer, and gas, and other fundamentals. I know 
it's getting late, but could you just real briefly

37:00.258 --> 37:08.978
touch on the role of zoning in being able to bring 
about some of those changes? Were areas re-zoned?

37:11.102 --> 37:13.949
To me, zoning is so fundamental. We just adopted 
zoning here six months ago. And Houston, they were

37:17.386 --> 37:19.128
in it. Well, Houston is going to suffer, too, 
deeply, because they were able to grow fast enough

37:19.548 --> 37:35.505
that they could replace the sins of the first tier 
of development by the great magnitudes of the

37:19.548 --> 37:35.505
second tier of development as the great buildings 
came down upon the slums. But you notice that

37:35.845 --> 37:37.707
stopped. And you now got that entire around 
Houston of pretty sick slums that didn't want to go

37:37.727 --> 37:43.974
anyplace. Nobody was going to buy those out. 
You've got growth beyond the expressway, and

37:45.989 --> 37:49.773
you've got the center city growth. And that's the 
big problem is it doesn't have any zoning. And you

37:53.137 --> 37:56.961
go in that middle area, some things you just can't 
believe. Burned out structures that have been

37:57.982 --> 38:06.371
there for years that just left alone because in 
that twilight zone, they can't really restore

37:57.982 --> 38:06.371
those houses. And they don't want to. It's got to 
demand as business investment. But were there

38:10.836 --> 38:14.280
areas like that in Corpus Christi? No. didn't 
leave that opportunity. When Bill Anderson went

38:17.689 --> 38:22.957
to Corpus Christi in 54, I guess he did, maybe. Is 
that the date? He said it was in the early 50s,

38:24.980 --> 38:27.564
mid-50s. Maybe 53. But let's say it's 54.

38:32.311 --> 38:34.294
Basically, the city was out to Louisiana.

38:37.219 --> 38:40.043
I moved into a house in the

38:43.195 --> 38:45.838
You know where Louisiana meets Staples? Right. I 
moved into a house four doors down from that

38:47.159 --> 38:49.882
corner. And they were just pavement staples at 
that time. Staples was just a two lane canyon road.

38:58.290 --> 38:59.912
And that's 56.

39:02.815 --> 39:06.419
So most of the subdivisions that are there now 
weren't there. All the south side had not

39:06.499 --> 39:10.603
developed. The city didn't go across Potter 
Island Drive except Gardendale.

39:17.674 --> 39:21.598
The city was not connected out to Calhoun and the 
Phyllis Midway and those areas. Was the city at

39:22.299 --> 39:24.281
that time using zoning? Yeah, it said zoning for 
years. Bill might have had a hand in making the

39:27.905 --> 39:32.770
first zoning ordinance, but I think it might have 
even predated him. I know he helped to improve it.

39:35.473 --> 39:39.477
But I think you'll find almost all of Cork City's 
growth has been under the guidance of zoning. Now,

39:40.165 --> 39:42.728
it's only when it was followed. And the exception 
to those always seemed to exaggerate the rules, so

39:42.748 --> 39:47.793
to speak. Just because there's a plan for 
Everhart, for instance. Everhart's the worst

39:53.179 --> 39:55.201
example. Everhart, and the plan was to be a feeder 
street. Which plan is it? The so-called Everhart

40:03.009 --> 40:06.933
plan, which is a special plan for Everhart. 
Everhart's only plan. But the Everhart Zoning

40:08.448 --> 40:16.937
Plan said that it was to be basically just a 
residential street with some offices and some

40:08.448 --> 40:16.937
apartments. No, not even offices. Just a 
residential street, really, serving as a

40:18.219 --> 40:22.824
collector. And the two majors are supposed to be 
Weber and Staples, with good reason. Both Weber

40:26.447 --> 40:30.852
and Staples go across Oso Creek and feed in. And 
they also come on through to Ocean Drive.

40:37.422 --> 40:40.385
Staples, of course, because it's the main street 
all the way through town. Staples is the only

40:40.825 --> 40:47.171
street that goes from the ship channel to out 
beyond the city limits.

40:48.352 --> 40:55.159
But people came in to try to make Everhart, to 
convert the lots into businesses, into offices.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.801
And so one by one, Everhart fell. Did they apply for 
zoning variances or variances to the zoning plan?

41:03.727 --> 41:04.948
No, it was just rezoning. It was just rezoning. 
Residential uses. Of course, the problem was that

41:08.054 --> 41:14.020
Everhart, when it was laid out, was laid out with a 
lot of residential lots facing the street. So

41:15.241 --> 41:18.684
those were prime suspects to get rezoned. Who's 
going to want to buy a house on Everhart facing the

41:19.485 --> 41:27.853
street with all the traffic, and the kids can't 
move here, and you can't rob me of my investment. I

41:27.873 --> 41:29.795
need to be able to convert it into an office. So one 
by one, the street turned. Everhart went down. But

41:35.100 --> 41:37.062
that's by their choice. I can sit back from 
perspective and say that they're all going to be

41:37.514 --> 41:41.399
starved. Because already the 80s have already 
told them that. If you go to the Corpus Christi

41:44.824 --> 41:49.570
right now, you'll see that Weber and Staples are 
getting the substantial growth. The office

41:50.492 --> 41:53.035
buildings, the shopping centers, the big 
shopping centers. The major improvements, the

41:53.776 --> 41:57.321
heavy investment. And Everhart is smothered.

42:02.368 --> 42:05.412
A lot of quick improvements when there's only an 
open belt. where people put in a little office

42:05.662 --> 42:09.851
building here, but they can't get to it. The 
congestion is so bad on the other part that no one

42:10.512 --> 42:14.661
wants to be there now. So the offices that are 
developing nicely are on Weber and on Staples,

42:15.282 --> 42:23.620
where the road's 64 feet wide, or a little wider 
maybe. where you have traffic lights every half

42:23.600 --> 42:31.847
mile, and where you have left turn lanes, and all of 
the conveniences that you have in a wider road.

42:31.927 --> 42:36.612
Everhart's 50 feet in certain portions, and out 
towards the country club for you. Right.

42:40.976 --> 42:45.640
But I guess the people who have their offices along 
Everhart are doing all right. They're fussing

42:46.200 --> 42:48.522
about what the city's going to do about the 
Everhart problem. Of course, the Everhart

42:49.263 --> 42:53.607
problem shouldn't have been there if the zoning 
plan had been followed. What was that, the

42:54.127 --> 42:58.150
responsibility of the planning department? Oh, 
no, no, this was just one of these things. It was

43:01.633 --> 43:03.775
very well supported. I mean, our zoning plan was a 
well-done document, and it was fought on every

43:03.875 --> 43:09.260
lot. So there was so much resistance by the people 
of the city to the plan? No, that's too grandiose.

43:19.549 --> 43:21.871
Zoning deals with the people up and down the 
street. The rest of the city couldn't care less. I

43:23.641 --> 43:27.946
mean, the guardians of the zoning of the city are 
the planning commission and the city council. The

43:28.767 --> 43:31.891
citizens get involved only when they're within 
200 feet of change. Then they hoot and holler. But

43:34.955 --> 43:39.080
they don't even notice when the same thing's 
happening someplace else. They just ignore it. So

43:39.521 --> 43:41.683
if the city council was the guardian of the plan. 
It's a big plan. But they're also the ones that have

43:43.906 --> 43:45.548
to face reality. And for instance, in this case, 
you had a lot of single family lots facing the

43:46.469 --> 43:51.876
street. You can say, well, maybe the plan was 
wrong. Maybe it was. Maybe the plan should have

43:56.134 --> 43:59.822
said that we had to find some way to buy one of these 
lots and widen the street. That would have been a

44:01.847 --> 44:05.275
very practical alternative.

44:06.284 --> 44:11.191
The only point I'm making here is that zoning, too, 
has to be flexible. It has to change. And it can

44:11.953 --> 44:14.256
guide the city quite well. And there's no doubt 
that Bill Anderson's work and others in seeing

44:14.917 --> 44:21.867
that the major streets were laid out in a somewhat 
logical manner. Not logical the first time you're

44:22.749 --> 44:29.078
in town, but I mean, if you've been there a little 
while, they begin to make sense when you realize

44:22.749 --> 44:29.078
you like the fingers of my hand. And they go off in 
different directions. But the major streets are

44:31.922 --> 44:33.625
there. Of course, the south part of the city, 
that's probably shown even more distinctly than

44:33.875 --> 44:54.837
any place else, where you really haven't had very 
many zoning problems in the south part of the city,

44:33.875 --> 44:54.837
where Alameda has been a very clear feeder street 
and ocean drive and staples and the areas that

44:33.875 --> 44:54.837
developed around those streets really quite 
orderly and where they make sense. Good, solid

44:54.978 --> 44:57.300
shopping centers that very rarely have 
vacancies. And that's part of the test of whether

44:57.770 --> 45:01.274
it's successful or not. Whether the buying power 
is related to the quantity of commercial space in

45:01.915 --> 45:09.803
the south part of the city, that's been done quite 
well. Of course, it's also the more well-to-do

45:09.823 --> 45:14.028
part of the city, so that makes it easier. Then we 
can try to face the same problems in a lossy port

45:14.048 --> 45:17.672
area.

45:23.438 --> 45:26.241
Obviously, the city's grown tremendously. But 
basically, the building's been provided for by

45:26.963 --> 45:34.735
the whole city structure. I wouldn't call it 
planning. It's differentiated from the rest of

45:36.077 --> 45:42.006
management.

45:42.026 --> 45:46.713
I lost my faith in capital improvement programs 
quite a while ago. And even though I'm getting

45:46.733 --> 45:55.587
ready to prepare one here, I just don't believe in 
it anymore, even though I'm as wrapped up in it as

45:46.733 --> 45:55.587
anybody could be. except to plan for what you can 
actually do. Within a certain what range of years?

46:04.820 --> 46:06.282
No, within a certain range of money. Of money? 
Yeah. We stopped about 10 years ago in Corpus

46:08.105 --> 46:10.949
Christi having capital programs. They're bond 
programs. A bond program may be three or five

46:13.072 --> 46:20.582
years, but still it's the only time it's really 
christened in and adopted is at the time that

46:13.072 --> 46:20.582
you're going to face that financing. Because 
otherwise the planning program becomes just a

46:20.602 --> 46:24.207
wish list. And then you get all kinds of false 
expectations. You get people expecting those

46:26.970 --> 46:30.134
things to happen on the schedules that are shown. 
And then they become disgruntled if it doesn't

46:31.176 --> 46:32.838
happen. They say, hey, you promised to pay this 
street two years ago. Why isn't it paying? Oh, that

46:37.144 --> 46:37.945
was a plan. That was our idea. We didn't have the 
money at that time. And it's a very empty process.

46:45.716 --> 46:50.322
It's a very empty process to be dealing with 
physical needs, but without the money. Come here,

46:50.362 --> 46:53.446
Flo. That's OK. OK.
