WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:19.609
Testing, testing A, B, C. Testing, testing January 31, CBA, CBA, testing CBA.

00:24.078 --> 00:27.401
This is Thursday, January 31.

00:28.322 --> 00:31.845
Have the pleasure of chatting with John Effinger, class of?

00:31.865 --> 00:31.925
75.

00:31.945 --> 00:34.808
75, one of the youngsters.

00:36.489 --> 00:48.440
John, to help anybody understand your background, please give us a biographical summary of parents growing up, high school.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.823
Tell us about everything you did before you came to A&M.

00:53.896 --> 00:55.839
In 30 seconds or less.

00:55.859 --> 00:58.043
No, it doesn't have to be real brief.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.647
My parents are Jack and Sally Effinger.

01:01.909 --> 01:02.630
Bo's still living.

01:03.291 --> 01:04.753
Father's an attorney.

01:04.913 --> 01:15.270
He's the only son and one of two children of a son of a German immigrant family that came into Medina-Hondo area.

01:16.391 --> 01:18.655
His dad...

01:19.478 --> 01:47.207
ended up being the postmaster for Alamo Heights post office in San Antonio and in 1927 he and his brother who was a construction person built their frame wood house in San Antonio that he ended up dying in lived all his life in after that so obviously a lot of German stock and core values there my mother

01:47.592 --> 02:12.790
family came from Alabama her father passed away early in life but I knew her mother very well as well as my dad's father and her mother spent a good part of her young adult life in the Philippines yeah it's so fascinating getting a little bit of culture that way

02:13.512 --> 02:15.816
I'm just a West Texas kid, grew up in Midland.

02:16.277 --> 02:22.588
My father came back from Korea, served time in Judge Advocate General's Corps as a St.

02:22.608 --> 02:24.011
Mary's graduate in San Antonio.

02:24.852 --> 02:35.571
And he and my mom got married December 26, 1951 at the chapel at Fort Sam Houston and just had their 50th a couple of weeks ago, which we had a grand celebration on.

02:36.327 --> 02:37.949
And he went off to Korea.

02:38.190 --> 02:43.577
I was born at Fort Sills, spent all of about six weeks, came back and lived at Fort Sam most of my early years.

02:43.737 --> 02:45.720
And then at six, we moved out to Midland.

02:47.182 --> 02:50.507
Went to parochial school out in Midland through eighth grade.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.870
We moved my ninth grade year.

02:52.991 --> 02:55.194
Dad took a job in San Antonio.

02:55.714 --> 03:00.762
The highlight of that wasn't so much high school because I went to three and four years.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.647
Highlight was Hemisphere in 1968, which was outstanding.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.329
We moved to Houston my junior year in high school.

03:09.050 --> 03:11.853
While in San Antonio, I'd been in the ROTC program.

03:12.494 --> 03:29.892
It made a major difference in my life, and a good friend of my mother's had a son that was a year ahead of me, and I came up my junior year to see what the Cork and Desk was like and fell in love with A&M and have never looked back and never thought about any place else.

03:30.445 --> 03:32.650
So I came to A&M thinking, I'm going to be Army.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.995
Didn't have to worry about a decree or anything else.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.297
Didn't have to worry about late in life.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.881
Just go through the Corps and I'll be set.

03:40.105 --> 03:41.569
Spent four years in the Corps.

03:42.891 --> 03:44.555
We'll get to that.

03:44.675 --> 03:45.797
We're going to detail on that.

03:45.817 --> 03:46.118
OK.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.802
And let's see.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.708
When you came up to visit, you were a junior?

03:51.189 --> 03:51.289
Yeah.

03:51.691 --> 03:53.453
Did you come by yourself or with somebody?

03:53.473 --> 03:53.673
No, no.

03:53.693 --> 03:57.237
We took, there was a class outing from a high school.

03:57.718 --> 04:01.963
And we came up here, spent the day, watched the Corps march in, sat in Horseshoe.

04:02.504 --> 04:03.925
Horseshoe was still there at that time.

04:04.926 --> 04:09.331
And spent time in the dorm, got to get in the dorm.

04:09.351 --> 04:16.720
And actually, since Tim Frazier was a freshman, I got a chance to see what it was like to see fish on the wall still.

04:17.763 --> 04:21.607
One other quick note I just thought.

04:22.589 --> 04:26.793
My dad has no idea what he did to err in life, but he has.

04:27.634 --> 04:30.798
All three sons out of five of us are A&M graduates.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.983
One's the sales manager that runs a small company in Houston.

04:35.784 --> 04:43.112
My other brother's a doctor on the faculty at Southwestern Medical School and just was president of the faculty senate last year.

04:43.953 --> 04:48.578
And he has a daughter-in-law, my wife Kathy, who's class of 76.

04:49.138 --> 04:50.640
So he's done well by now.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.863
Did you go to fish camp by chance?

04:53.883 --> 04:55.425
No, never did.

04:55.445 --> 04:56.346
All right.

04:58.127 --> 05:04.994
When you came up to enroll, describe who brought you and what you brought with you.

05:06.015 --> 05:09.459
Talk about that trip.

05:09.659 --> 05:10.760
It was interesting.

05:11.141 --> 05:13.403
Came up during the summertime.

05:13.923 --> 05:23.672
knew that I wanted to get in the Corps, knew it was going to be the Army, had no thought about major, but I knew I wanted, at that time, wanted to make the Army career.

05:24.553 --> 05:41.128
Ended up, the only thing I can truly remember about that two or three days here, aside from a lot of meetings and going across campus, was when you went to sign up for an outfit, and I knew that Tim Frazier had been

05:41.615 --> 05:48.048
in the freshman class of an outfit called D2 the year before, brand new unit, a relatively new unit, I think.

05:49.150 --> 06:01.615
And so I signed up for that thinking, well, that would be kind of a safe haven because he'd be a sophomore in my outfit, and little did I realize that that probably was not a smart idea at the time, but it turned out great because the outfit was terrific.

06:02.067 --> 06:05.892
But that's really the only thing I can remember is signing up for D2 in that time frame.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.236
But now you're coming up to begin the class.

06:09.197 --> 06:10.119
Parents brought me up.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.923
What did you have in your footlocker?

06:14.164 --> 06:15.827
You know, I don't really remember, Haskell.

06:15.847 --> 06:17.109
There wasn't a lot of stuff.

06:17.269 --> 06:26.522
But we walked in the dorm and walked into the room right after Little East Texas going out a little.

06:26.890 --> 06:31.117
And East Texas guy from Mount Pleasant had just moved in with his parents.

06:31.998 --> 06:33.600
His parents brought him named Louie Gohmert.

06:33.841 --> 06:34.842
Louie was my fish roommate.

06:35.083 --> 06:36.625
G-O-M-M?

06:36.825 --> 06:39.810
G-O-H-M-E-R-T.

06:39.830 --> 06:39.930
Okay.

06:39.950 --> 06:48.003
And so Louie and I started off the semester, and D2 was pretty strong about not bringing a lot up.

06:48.784 --> 06:52.009
My senior year, we were still in freshman room or sophomore rooms.

06:54.012 --> 06:55.294
Did D2 have a nickname?

06:55.527 --> 06:57.730
Dog company, hell-bent canines, all or none.

06:57.931 --> 07:00.655
Dog company, hell-bent canines, all or none.

07:01.757 --> 07:02.998
Okay, and it was Army?

07:03.319 --> 07:04.561
Army, Sacred Brigade.

07:05.562 --> 07:07.405
Any particular group of majors?

07:08.407 --> 07:10.350
At that time, predominantly liberal arts.

07:10.390 --> 07:12.914
There was some ag in there, but mainly liberal arts.

07:12.934 --> 07:22.969
All right, describe for me now as a beginner how you became oriented into and received into the corps.

07:24.974 --> 07:26.596
Good times.

07:26.676 --> 07:29.419
Let me set the stage.

07:29.439 --> 07:35.105
D2, I think at that time, was in its second year of existence.

07:35.125 --> 07:40.491
It had been formed when several units had been broken apart and reformed.

07:41.712 --> 07:47.198
The year before I got there, it was, I think, 40th out of 40 outfits in general war.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.962
And it was already on probation.

07:50.562 --> 07:54.947
Now, there's a setup for that, because we did something really interesting as an outfit.

07:55.602 --> 08:02.194
We had a Wild Bill White, who ended up being Airborne and Ranger, was our first sergeant.

08:02.795 --> 08:13.075
So we got to know Bill White very well the first week and learned right when we got our first haircuts, some with hair down to their shoulders, what it was going to be like in D2.

08:13.135 --> 08:14.938
There were 13 of us when we started.

08:16.521 --> 08:18.184
But we had a week with Bill White.

08:18.552 --> 08:21.095
under a little oversight by the seniors.

08:21.135 --> 08:25.781
We had two terrific, we had a great CEO named Mike Thompson and an exo named Doug Blake.

08:27.483 --> 08:30.827
But Bill really ran the show and it was focused.

08:31.228 --> 08:34.232
It was, you guys are gonna shape up or ship out.

08:34.632 --> 08:36.114
Now this is a week before classes begin.

08:36.134 --> 08:37.336
This is a week before classes.

08:37.696 --> 08:38.657
We learned to march.

08:38.757 --> 08:40.760
We learned to hit the wall.

08:40.820 --> 08:44.104
We learned all the things that a fish would learn.

08:44.675 --> 08:48.886
And he was pretty tough, and one of the best things to happen.

08:48.906 --> 08:49.588
This is the new.

08:50.911 --> 08:52.375
Y'all are over and over.

08:52.495 --> 08:55.263
Yeah, we were in dorm six, fourth stupid dorm six.

08:55.784 --> 09:01.519
And interesting, this was the last year, Haskell, that you could walk across the campus

09:01.955 --> 09:04.319
and fish were treated as fish campus-wide.

09:04.339 --> 09:07.624
You know, they limited to the next year, you had to be in the quad.

09:07.644 --> 09:15.617
So any trek out, we still moved in schools of fish, and particularly when we went to Northgate to get haircuts or anything else, we traveled in schools.

09:16.419 --> 09:20.726
And it was not unusual to, in fact, Bill Broke is in pretty well.

09:20.766 --> 09:28.198
We did lots of marches across campus to Cebesa for dinner that first week, because Duncan wasn't going.

09:28.567 --> 09:34.095
And then we, lots of Northgate excursions, but all under constant supervision of Bill White.

09:34.555 --> 09:39.322
During that week, describe a typical day's routine.

09:39.983 --> 09:41.445
You got up and did what, when?

09:44.829 --> 09:46.452
It started the night before.

09:46.612 --> 09:47.914
We shined shoes every night.

09:48.715 --> 09:55.143
Had to get a, there was, we didn't know what was happening as fish.

09:55.384 --> 09:57.747
Obviously, you'd never know what the output wants to try to do.

09:58.435 --> 10:07.691
But there was a real attention that we were going to not lose any points, didn't know what that meant, on inspections this semester.

10:08.933 --> 10:22.637
And so there was an extreme focus on uniforms, how you wear the uniform, brass being shined all the time, hair being as short as you're going to get it.

10:23.258 --> 10:47.224
rooms kept absolutely meticulous we we had no excess stuff if people came up with stereos those went back that first go around that I do remember bare rooms there was beginning focus on grades but it was really we will not lose any points on inspections room inspection personal appearance inspection

10:47.761 --> 10:50.744
and then we will not lose any points on drills and reviews.

10:50.804 --> 10:53.326
So we did lots of drilling and drilling and drilling.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.971
And that first week, yes, lots of P2.

10:58.752 --> 10:59.693
It started to window us out.

10:59.733 --> 11:02.435
We lost a few that first week.

11:02.656 --> 11:12.966
But there was a very, and the only way I can describe it, it was extreme focus on discipline and focus on what you were going to be doing in the Corps.

11:13.546 --> 11:15.388
And there weren't many juniors and seniors.

11:15.858 --> 11:19.762
No, the only ones I remember were Bill White and Mike Griswold, who were juniors.

11:20.102 --> 11:21.884
The other juniors didn't come in until later.

11:21.904 --> 11:25.967
And this is something we kept going through my sophomore, junior, senior years.

11:26.087 --> 11:28.309
And the CO and the XO.

11:28.390 --> 11:31.893
Sophomores weren't on campus until right at the end of that first week.

11:31.913 --> 11:34.775
And, of course, we met them bright and early the second week.

11:35.056 --> 11:39.420
All right, during that week, you got your outfit, you got your uniforms.

11:39.820 --> 11:43.063
Right, learned where the laundry was, learned...

11:43.752 --> 11:45.854
where Dunkin' was, but we weren't eating a Dunkin'.

11:45.874 --> 11:47.536
We were still marching over to Cebiza.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.720
I don't remember why, but we weren't in Dunkin' at that time.

11:51.841 --> 11:54.484
Learned beginning campusology, hitting the wall.

11:54.985 --> 11:57.388
We had Reveille in the dorm all four years.

11:58.068 --> 12:03.335
So we learned what it was like to enter and see Reveille's paw sitting right outside the door still.

12:04.075 --> 12:08.140
And after a while, if you got over the fact that you were hitting the wall for a dog,

12:08.457 --> 12:13.624
you figured out, well, maybe there was a way, as a freshman would, to kind of get back a little bit at the dog.

12:13.704 --> 12:16.828
And so we would go running down there en masse.

12:17.309 --> 12:21.174
Of course, we didn't have restrictions on when you hit the wall during the day anymore at that time.

12:21.214 --> 12:25.280
And we would just, all of us, pop up against the wall, how do you miss Reveley man real loud?

12:25.460 --> 12:30.607
And she would then turn around and go back in the room, and we wouldn't have to hit the wall for Miss Reveley man anymore.

12:32.029 --> 12:36.355
So E2 probably would not like that statement, but that was fun.

12:36.638 --> 12:38.541
Now, did you acquire a nickname early?

12:39.202 --> 12:42.788
I don't remember a nickname.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.152
Describe your room.

12:45.893 --> 12:46.294
Spartan.

12:48.037 --> 12:48.858
It was really interesting.

12:49.058 --> 12:51.522
It was Spartan with the exception of one thing.

12:52.224 --> 12:54.307
Louis played a great guitar.

12:55.830 --> 12:57.673
Allowed to have a guitar?

12:58.133 --> 13:00.437
He brought it in halfway through the first semester.

13:00.477 --> 13:03.422
He had it by the second semester because he was serenading

13:03.942 --> 13:10.491
the younger sister of one of the juniors with the guitar, singing American Pie, which was a song back then.

13:11.032 --> 13:19.985
But yeah, he brought it in halfway through, and I think he got it because he had such good grades after the first half of the first semester.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.131
But Spartan, I mean, everything was military.

13:24.151 --> 13:25.954
There was nothing extreme.

13:25.974 --> 13:26.815
Two-level bunk?

13:26.835 --> 13:27.596
Two-level bunk.

13:28.197 --> 13:30.220
How did y'all decide who slept up and down?

13:30.959 --> 13:33.364
I was a shorter guy, so I slept on top.

13:34.446 --> 13:35.649
And Louie got the bottom bunk.

13:36.591 --> 13:38.014
At least that's what I think we did.

13:40.559 --> 13:42.743
In the future, I was always on the bottom bunk.

13:42.763 --> 13:44.627
And no radio, no record player?

13:44.647 --> 13:46.531
No radio, no cassette player at that time.

13:46.611 --> 13:47.613
No car at that time.

13:47.774 --> 13:48.696
Or at least I didn't.

13:48.716 --> 13:50.299
I don't think any of us had cars at that time.

13:50.319 --> 13:52.343
I dropped my VW, which I had at the...

13:52.660 --> 13:55.043
In Houston, I brought that up second semester.

13:55.143 --> 13:55.563
A bug?

13:55.583 --> 13:58.146
67BW bug.

13:58.226 --> 13:59.067
Remember Dean Powell?

13:59.768 --> 14:02.831
I sold it to Dean Powell so his sons could have a dune bug.

14:04.613 --> 14:06.835
And did you have any civilian clothing at all?

14:07.496 --> 14:07.976
Very little.

14:08.337 --> 14:12.742
I mean, it was all, I mean, if we had it, it would have been blue jeans and two shirts.

14:13.382 --> 14:15.985
We really didn't bring very much up.

14:16.218 --> 14:18.501
underwear, and that was about it.

14:19.882 --> 14:27.592
We learned early on that we had to have an extra supply of toothbrushes, because we got real good at cleaning out the cracks in the towel, those kind of things.

14:27.632 --> 14:29.594
But it was, I mean, it was very spartan.

14:32.137 --> 14:37.163
The second or third day there, we had uniforms after we had them hung correctly

14:37.463 --> 14:46.072
and we were inspected multiple times each day, and they had to be spaced correctly, couldn't be dust on the coat hangers or anything else.

14:46.132 --> 14:54.900
I mean, it was, we learned that if we were going to pass inspections, we had to be very, very good at minimizing what could collect dust.

14:55.441 --> 14:59.084
And how, you and your buddies, when you all got your hair cut, where?

14:59.525 --> 15:02.488
We went to Northgate, and there were a lot of them that had long hair.

15:02.528 --> 15:06.812
I mean, Warren Russell, who's now a colonel, had hair, we have,

15:09.610 --> 15:10.431
How long was yours?

15:11.232 --> 15:15.418
It wasn't that long, but it was probably collar length at that time.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.162
When the haircut was done, how long was everybody's hair?

15:19.664 --> 15:20.405
They were white walls.

15:20.886 --> 15:21.547
We got white walls.

15:21.647 --> 15:22.448
We didn't get gray.

15:22.548 --> 15:23.229
It was all white.

15:23.249 --> 15:26.073
Yeah, it was funny because I remember Warren particularly.

15:26.093 --> 15:29.538
He had the longest hair, and they sent Warren in the chair, and he was first.

15:30.299 --> 15:35.787
And the barber was one of the old military types, and he took the razor, and it just

15:36.172 --> 16:03.951
true i mean he just came right back over the scalp and once that was gone everything went now did you all start calling each other old lady yeah yeah immediately yeah okay yeah yeah no problem with it yeah i mean it was we we uh there's one other thing that happened during that week too that was interesting the only time that i remember we talked with there are two times that we talked

16:04.387 --> 16:20.168
uh with mike thompson who is the ceo this was in the this was september 71 or late august 71 so the first thing was no drugs no alcohol and and fairly strong it it it was uh

16:21.532 --> 16:51.302
really a focus on what could happen to a cadet if you got into problems that way and then the second one was we had a meeting almost like a come to bill white meeting and and mike started it off bill actually led it it was a revival that was really on the corps ethics and and the corps cadet honor book and i think a lot of it was driven because we'd been 40th last year and the year before and they were talking about disbanding it there were some pretty rowdy people that had been in the outfit that year

16:51.282 --> 16:52.464
Corps commander?

16:52.524 --> 16:54.987
Tom Stanley.

16:55.328 --> 16:56.569
No, Stanley was a sophomore.

16:56.589 --> 16:59.093
No, it was Tom Stanley because Louis dropped handles with him.

16:59.113 --> 17:00.374
Yeah, he was from Mount Pleasant.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.517
And the commandant?

17:02.537 --> 17:06.403
You know, I don't know that, but I don't think Parsons was there yet, but it may have been Parsons.

17:07.424 --> 17:07.724
Okay.

17:09.066 --> 17:12.872
And how long before you all saw the new president of A&M?

17:13.833 --> 17:16.176
I didn't actually see the new president until...

17:17.152 --> 17:18.414
Later in life.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.359
I mean we knew who he was, but I wasn't very active in student activities at that time.

17:22.399 --> 17:23.640
It was all D2.

17:23.961 --> 17:30.989
Although I didn't meet Dean Hennigan a couple of times.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.873
Describe that.

17:34.013 --> 17:35.815
Dean Hennigan and I had some interesting times.

17:35.855 --> 17:40.341
I remember going in halfway through my first semester and

17:40.878 --> 17:45.485
in the academic building in his office, and he was already starting to worry about my grades.

17:45.545 --> 17:49.732
My grades my first three semesters were not something to write home without at all.

17:50.172 --> 17:50.773
Very tenuous.

17:51.495 --> 17:56.122
But he was good about it and talked sternly.

17:56.602 --> 18:02.832
And there's a piece in my sophomore year I'll get back to that was rather interesting that helped him.

18:03.313 --> 18:05.316
All right, you what high school now?

18:05.617 --> 18:06.018
Aldine.

18:06.358 --> 18:07.841
Aldine High School in Houston.

18:07.861 --> 18:09.323
All right, then you're going to major in?

18:09.844 --> 18:12.628
At that time, it wouldn't have been liberal arts.

18:12.668 --> 18:13.510
It would have been history.

18:13.910 --> 18:14.611
I think it was history.

18:14.932 --> 18:15.873
It may have been poli-sci.

18:15.893 --> 18:19.980
All right, describe how you signed up for that first semester of classes.

18:20.841 --> 18:21.903
I don't even remember.

18:22.003 --> 18:23.946
I do remember we went.

18:24.213 --> 18:25.695
And I don't remember what building.

18:25.735 --> 18:28.059
It wasn't the building that was the old bookstore.

18:28.760 --> 18:29.621
But we went somewhere.

18:29.741 --> 18:33.827
It may have been Dunkin', and maybe that's why we weren't eating in Dunkin', to sign up there.

18:34.107 --> 18:35.630
But that part's blur.

18:35.670 --> 18:43.882
I mean, my memories of the first two years at A&M revolve around one thing and virtually one thing only.

18:43.902 --> 18:45.865
And that wasn't even the Corps Cadet.

18:46.085 --> 18:47.487
It was D2.

18:47.872 --> 18:54.681
Did anybody give y'all advice before you went to class or as you're beginning classes about how to survive and how to?

18:54.861 --> 18:55.622
No.

18:55.682 --> 18:58.266
That happened as we got into the first semester.

18:59.067 --> 18:59.928
How did it come about?

19:00.749 --> 19:01.450
Describe that.

19:01.610 --> 19:03.132
We didn't know the reason at that time.

19:04.254 --> 19:09.981
But we got at least into the first half of the first semester.

19:10.484 --> 19:17.956
And all of a sudden, we moved from real attention on military discipline and unit type stuff to grades.

19:18.137 --> 19:19.018
Got to have the GPs.

19:20.160 --> 19:26.070
And then that moved by the time we got to that to end the second semester index of grade activity.

19:26.090 --> 19:27.072
So grades came in.

19:27.132 --> 19:28.093
There was a major push.

19:28.674 --> 19:29.235
Study hours.

19:29.275 --> 19:31.138
We started doing a lot of things with study hours.

19:31.178 --> 19:36.407
I think even before some of the other units in our brigade and certainly within our back did.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.002
Mike was real keen on that.

19:39.063 --> 19:42.246
And Doug Blake wasn't really the scholastic officer.

19:42.826 --> 19:47.271
But Doug had, rumor has it, Doug actually played football as a freshman.

19:47.331 --> 19:49.353
He was a great big old guy.

19:49.373 --> 19:51.896
He'd make a perfect lineman or defensive lineman offense.

19:53.377 --> 19:56.000
But quite individual, kind of like the gentle bear.

19:56.561 --> 19:59.303
And he really took on the role of grades.

19:59.343 --> 20:03.728
And as we started to get GPs in, we could see that some of our class were struggling.

20:04.349 --> 20:10.691
started to work on how to really start to focus on grades, but the attention still was pretty much military stuff.

20:11.293 --> 20:15.507
Do you remember some of those first semester classes?

20:16.718 --> 20:41.545
at the house i sometimes i don't want to remember my school but describe going to class and learning the routine of college that was my problem i didn't go to class that much you know i was here to get the core connect education i didn't know what an agreement did you skip class no i skipped class way too much and what did you where were you when classes were being held oh where'd you hang out we were we were talking

20:42.115 --> 20:49.002
core stuff, D2 stuff, how we would do things different the next year, how we'd help out some of our buds that were having problems.

20:50.043 --> 20:56.350
A lot of time evading upperclassmen just to find some quiet places.

20:57.211 --> 21:03.217
There were a couple of classes that interest me, and I would do a lot of reading, but I never generated GPs like I should have.

21:04.679 --> 21:06.521
Military science a lot, that kind of stuff.

21:06.981 --> 21:10.705
We spent a lot of time that first semester, early morning runs,

21:11.140 --> 21:13.163
when we weren't supposed to be doing it, I don't think.

21:14.425 --> 21:15.967
Lots out to Eastwood and back.

21:17.430 --> 21:19.192
Interesting times doing PT.

21:19.533 --> 21:25.622
We never had the board, but we had a lot of PT and pretty extreme PT and physical training.

21:26.584 --> 21:27.846
Okay.

21:27.946 --> 21:29.648
What time would you all make those runs?

21:30.450 --> 21:33.034
Five in the morning, four in the morning.

21:33.054 --> 21:35.698
Not on school days, although there were a couple of school days.

21:37.060 --> 21:38.562
Early Saturday mornings out to Eastwood.

21:38.883 --> 21:39.223
Lots.

21:40.604 --> 21:44.850
Had a couple of rangers in the outfit, and that was kind of... Right.

21:45.792 --> 21:48.856
When you went to class, describe your routine.

21:48.876 --> 21:49.517
Where did you sit?

21:49.738 --> 21:51.420
Did you take notes?

21:51.600 --> 21:55.727
I wasn't a very good student in high school, so I'd sit in the back of the room.

21:55.767 --> 21:58.551
Didn't know how at that time to talk to professors.

21:59.813 --> 22:02.697
Didn't know how to try to stay plugged in when I was missing things.

22:03.537 --> 22:23.115
probably there was a lot of aversion when my grades started to come in and they weren't as good as they ought to be there was a lot of avoidance and so if I didn't go to class then it was out of mind in the near term of course then it caught up to you when you took tests and finals it was it was it was

22:23.905 --> 22:31.876
Literally, my first two years, I remember not having something that I really enjoyed from schoolwork, but I loved McCourt.

22:31.896 --> 22:35.181
All right, let's go to the chow hall.

22:35.201 --> 22:39.247
Describe the routine of your outfit at chow.

22:40.689 --> 22:46.357
Obviously, we marched in after rigorous inspections, whether we were inspected by somebody outside the outfit or not.

22:48.199 --> 22:53.507
Freshmen didn't eat very much the first semester, not till we had our outfit party in November.

22:54.263 --> 22:57.208
Always served hot corner at that time.

22:57.628 --> 23:00.473
Lots of milk drinking contests.

23:00.493 --> 23:04.279
Had more milk than we could think of what to do with in the glass jars at that time.

23:06.582 --> 23:11.810
Lots of running, I don't remember what we used to call them.

23:11.850 --> 23:15.997
They weren't really far enough, but it was light that to other outfits.

23:16.017 --> 23:16.698
Lots of quads.

23:16.778 --> 23:19.302
That's another thing that we did a lot early in the mornings.

23:19.322 --> 23:20.524
We'd take people to the quad.

23:20.926 --> 23:23.590
So, you know, juniors would send a junior, seniors would send a senior.

23:23.630 --> 23:24.732
Sometimes it was in the outfit.

23:24.772 --> 23:26.555
Generally, it was people outside the outfit.

23:27.216 --> 23:37.651
And so we'd take them, get them up early in the morning before first call, take them out, trash them out with water from the forest stoop and other ingredients, depending on the level of the exercise and those kind of things.

23:39.234 --> 23:43.941
And then what punishment would you all get in return for that prank?

23:43.961 --> 23:44.622
Didn't get any.

23:45.764 --> 23:46.805
Oh, really?

23:46.906 --> 23:47.526
No.

23:47.867 --> 23:49.870
We weren't yelled at as much if we did a good job.

23:50.035 --> 23:51.396
Oh, okay.

23:51.517 --> 23:52.858
These were not from your outfit?

23:52.878 --> 23:55.080
No, they were generally going outside the outfit.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.443
There was very little inside the outfit.

23:57.863 --> 24:03.609
It was pretty tight, which is unusual, because I think that our senior class, and I know our junior class, was pretty large.

24:04.230 --> 24:10.096
All right, how did you all keep other outfits from doing the same to your upperclassmen?

24:10.116 --> 24:18.304
You know, I don't know how that happened, but they didn't get, I mean, I'm sure they got quieted, but I don't have any, and maybe that's because we were doing so many, we were,

24:18.622 --> 24:19.944
they were getting retaliated at.

24:19.964 --> 24:21.587
But we got pretty good at what we did.

24:22.268 --> 24:25.634
We could get into a room even if it was pretty well locked.

24:25.674 --> 24:31.104
Back in the dining hall, what kind of games, tricks, pranks did y'all play during the meal?

24:32.506 --> 24:37.175
Flying buzzards would be, well, we did lots of milk contests.

24:37.575 --> 24:41.963
How many of the, I think there were quarts at that time, how many quarts of milk could you drink

24:42.770 --> 24:45.516
before you literally almost exploded.

24:46.217 --> 24:57.541
And we would have hot dog eating contests when we had hot dog nights and never got to eat steak on Wednesday night, even though steak was the entree.

24:57.641 --> 24:58.382
We never got it.

24:58.423 --> 25:01.048
It always got some of the classmen, upperclassmen got it.

25:01.653 --> 25:04.657
Got lots of scrabble eggs for some reason.

25:04.717 --> 25:05.558
Don't ask me why.

25:05.598 --> 25:07.800
That was the only thing that was left there.

25:08.841 --> 25:17.051
We generally didn't eat because we were doing all sorts of stuff, either campusology or contests before the upperclassmen left.

25:17.071 --> 25:22.918
And a couple of flying buzzards, which is, and we didn't have a guy near as good as some of the outfits, but

25:23.253 --> 25:36.854
You'd take stuff like scrambled eggs and mashed potatoes, something really gooey, and pack it just into a guy's mouth, and then he'd make like a buzzard, and he'd go seek out his prey, and he'd get right up to his prey, and all over the uniform and that kind of stuff.

25:36.894 --> 25:38.557
But pretty easy stuff.

25:39.098 --> 25:40.059
Nothing really bad.

25:40.720 --> 25:48.272
They were real focused, I think, on having fun and doing things, but not doing it to that part we didn't do extremely.

25:48.292 --> 25:51.657
What Cush questions, what are your favorite that you remember?

25:53.189 --> 25:54.971
You know, I don't even remember back then.

25:55.752 --> 25:56.674
I don't remember any.

25:56.694 --> 25:58.576
OK.

25:59.677 --> 26:01.700
Then as.

26:01.780 --> 26:03.302
Maybe because we didn't eat a lot of kush.

26:04.343 --> 26:07.127
As football season is coming around.

26:07.147 --> 26:07.548
Oh, yeah.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.230
Campusology at the wazoo.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.214
Had to know everything about everything about everything.

26:12.514 --> 26:12.714
And.

26:14.397 --> 26:16.219
We had to know the team too deep.

26:16.259 --> 26:18.181
And of course, this was Gene Stallings last year.

26:18.201 --> 26:22.487
So there was a real incentive to know the team too deep.

26:22.737 --> 26:28.140
Describe the routine of a game day for a freshman.

26:29.183 --> 26:30.806
Because we still had Saturday classes.

26:31.146 --> 26:33.330
Yeah, we actually put up the flags a lot.

26:34.191 --> 26:45.569
And I don't remember classes on Saturdays, but we always, I think there were three times at least, if not more, we had flag detail on the main drive, which was really cool.

26:46.150 --> 26:47.532
That was a neat experience.

26:47.552 --> 26:56.727
Because I mean, they marched, primarily it was all freshmen, and we marched out and put the flags up along the main drive coming into the main administration building.

26:57.938 --> 27:03.006
In later years, I remember it more because we would always go out and get uniforms at the off-campus cleaners.

27:04.027 --> 27:06.391
But it was getting uniform ready.

27:07.372 --> 27:12.460
Because we didn't have cars and there weren't girls living on campus, we didn't have any dates, really.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.604
I was, quote, engaged to a girl in Houston.

27:16.386 --> 27:17.327
She would come up.

27:17.828 --> 27:19.330
She came up for a couple of games.

27:19.791 --> 27:23.196
And so you had the ritual of going out to Eastgate and meeting the bus.

27:23.276 --> 27:27.422
And literally, the whole bus was girls coming up from Houston and points between.

27:27.605 --> 27:53.545
and and you would find places for them to stay in some of the motels that were all within walking distance and that kind of stuff uh long walks obviously but uh the first couple of uh games it was all the focus was we will not lose uh we want high rankings on our march ins even if they were the practice ones at that time so i mean it was it was a pretty spartan existence at that stage

27:53.660 --> 27:57.287
Then you all marched in, you stood with your outfit.

27:57.387 --> 28:00.493
Stood with the outfit, marched in, and survived to getting back.

28:01.234 --> 28:06.003
Midnight Yale practice, you were always with your fish buds, never got outside that group.

28:06.364 --> 28:11.614
And we had Yale practices, I think, on Thursday or Wednesday nights in the evenings as well.

28:11.634 --> 28:12.896
We'd go to the old job dorm.

28:13.457 --> 28:15.060
We'd march from the quad and go there.

28:15.631 --> 28:21.019
And so, march isn't the right word, but we'd troop behind and get there.

28:22.882 --> 28:27.548
But... Did you see or hear Gene Stallings that fall?

28:28.910 --> 28:36.621
The only recollection I have of Gene is when he had dinner in Duncan Dining Hall after he was let go.

28:36.802 --> 28:40.107
It was his last dinner in the Corps.

28:40.127 --> 28:43.191
And the only reason I remember that one is that Reveille, literally...

28:43.964 --> 29:05.432
you know i like gene i met him much later in life and talked to and he talked to our some of our former student group uh and current students uh but rev got right next to the table he was sitting at a core table and immediately decided it was time that she needed to uh to use a restroom and dropped a load right there

29:05.632 --> 29:07.394
next to him, next to the table.

29:07.734 --> 29:17.305
And that poor E2 cadet turned her around and he's pulling her literally back and she's just laying down the aisle.

29:17.325 --> 29:21.369
And of course, everybody went ballistic and I feel sorry for him at that stage.

29:21.389 --> 29:31.200
But of course, you know, the couple of times we had girls up there, we were kissing on first downs, which were you and far between, so there wasn't any real love lost.

29:31.906 --> 29:37.677
Then, let's see, you're in your uniform.

29:38.218 --> 29:43.870
What did you and your buddies do after the games, football games?

29:43.890 --> 29:46.415
Oh, things that we probably weren't really supposed to be able to do.

29:46.435 --> 29:50.964
Every once in a while, we figured out where we could find some beer, and we were still underage at that time.

29:51.124 --> 29:53.188
Didn't drink a lot, but there was some.

29:53.911 --> 29:57.975
A lot of, I mean, we really didn't get out that much.

29:58.015 --> 30:01.299
We did a lot of walking wherever we went because we didn't have cars.

30:03.882 --> 30:06.324
No nightlife at that time to speak of.

30:07.886 --> 30:12.811
So we would go find some place to just sit and talk, but that was about it.

30:12.851 --> 30:15.534
Yeah, we did pick up a bad habit then.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.717
We had this crazy game.

30:19.599 --> 30:22.602
Maybe one of those things we edit sometimes.

30:23.189 --> 30:29.398
Do you know how close you have to be to see the numbers on a train at night before you get off?

30:31.261 --> 30:33.464
So we did some pretty stupid things, too.

30:33.504 --> 30:40.795
So we would get out on a well-worn highway, and we would stand on the tracks and wait for the train and stand there until you could see the numbers.

30:40.855 --> 30:42.678
And it was chicken to see who got off last.

30:42.758 --> 30:45.903
So yeah, but again, we had airborne rangers in our outfit.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.066
Some of our guys became airborne rangers.

30:48.417 --> 30:50.379
That was one of those things we did that was stupid.

30:50.440 --> 30:51.701
That's how we spent a lot of our time.

30:52.622 --> 30:55.266
But yeah, there was probably a lot of beer out there, too, just to get about it.

30:55.566 --> 30:58.069
Now, underage, where did y'all get the beer?

30:59.271 --> 30:59.711
Northgate.

31:00.252 --> 31:03.276
There was a 7-Eleven, a store like a 7-Eleven.

31:03.376 --> 31:05.018
And they would sell to underage.

31:06.399 --> 31:17.293
How often did... It depended on who bought it and whether you had a growth on your... Obviously, we didn't have beers, but if you look like you could be older...

31:17.628 --> 31:21.513
There were guys in other outfits that actually had IDs.

31:21.553 --> 31:25.939
And one of our guys, we had a great big old guy named Ed Guerrero, and Ed was pretty good at getting beer.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.421
So we'd get a couple.

31:27.462 --> 31:28.543
Where would y'all go to drink it?

31:28.843 --> 31:29.504
Wellborn Road.

31:30.626 --> 31:32.448
We'd find somebody that had a vehicle.

31:32.589 --> 31:34.872
We'd all pile into it if we had to make two or three times.

31:35.493 --> 31:44.865
And generally what we'd do is go out Wellborn and then back over the railroad track, which is how we started doing the railroad track deal, into a cattle gate and just sit up there.

31:46.147 --> 31:47.449
How often did somebody get drunk?

31:50.450 --> 31:52.082
Well, if they were cheap drunk, pretty quick.

31:52.807 --> 31:53.351
A lot.

31:53.875 --> 31:54.942
There weren't a lot.
