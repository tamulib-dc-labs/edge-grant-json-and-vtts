WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:07.751
Is the college making an appropriate effort to try to correct these?

00:09.096 --> 00:09.437
Yes.

00:10.781 --> 00:15.677
And we've done, we're doing much better now than we were then.

00:16.163 --> 00:18.087
But we were attentive to it then.

00:18.107 --> 00:34.678
I think what you had was a case where there were so many factors, many women coming into their careers later in life as I was, so that when you start trying to compare,

00:34.658 --> 00:36.300
It's hard to compare.

00:36.360 --> 00:49.138
Years of experience, years since degree, it's very difficult to say what are exactly equivalent people.

00:50.359 --> 00:53.764
Now we certainly realized then and we realize now that

00:54.520 --> 01:06.981
Anyone who's in an underrepresented group on campus is likely to be swamped with student demands for advising, help me, what should I do in this case?

01:07.041 --> 01:08.383
How should I handle that case?

01:09.605 --> 01:19.482
These very important demands on them are likely to be much heavier than they are for members of a minority group, of a majority.

01:20.137 --> 01:35.914
group, and those things must be taken into account in annual evaluations, in promotion and tenure cases, and they are hard as the Dickens to weigh properly.

01:36.134 --> 01:44.743
As you judged it then, how did the status of a minority female

01:45.584 --> 01:51.895
in terms of salary and whatever else, compared with that of a majority female?

01:55.742 --> 02:02.293
There were so few, and there still are so few, that that's hard to answer.

02:05.986 --> 02:12.437
I can think right off of only two examples, though surely there were others.

02:13.920 --> 02:19.690
In one case, the minority female was probably paid somewhat less.

02:20.692 --> 02:25.480
Her record on the surface of it would have looked fairly weak.

02:25.460 --> 02:34.010
But I knew what pressures she always faced in this community, in the university, the pressures of isolation.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.293
How can you compare that?

02:36.333 --> 02:44.082
In the other case I'm thinking of, the person was relatively high paid compared with colleagues.

02:45.543 --> 02:53.813
Statisticians refer to the small n problem, and it's very hard to generalize when you have a small n, a small number.

02:54.805 --> 03:04.624
When you began that task as associate dean, did the dean or anyone else give you any guidelines, any directions, any counsel?

03:07.731 --> 03:12.420
When I reported for duty up here, I think they had forgotten I was coming to work that day.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.025
They didn't have a desk for me to sit at.

03:15.005 --> 03:24.535
There were no instructions what to do and not even any suggestions what to do, and that was pretty much the way all the way through.

03:24.576 --> 03:41.014
When the dean did his first kind of a semi-annual review with me, he said it seemed as though I'd had a little trouble getting going in my duties, and I don't think I quite had the nerve to say it, but what I thought was, is there any wonder?

03:41.074 --> 03:44.978
Nobody even gave me a clue what I was supposed to do.

03:45.683 --> 04:02.965
I started by making appointments with all the department heads and going to visit them on their turf, which I think is always important, and saying, what do you think is important for me to do in this job, and how would you suggest I get started at it?

04:03.485 --> 04:03.686
All right.

04:03.706 --> 04:05.488
Now, I'm not going to ask the negative on this one.

04:05.928 --> 04:13.598
As you made those first visits, which departments and or department heads made the most positive impressions on you?

04:14.287 --> 04:38.278
The one who made the most positive impression was the one who immediately seemed to understand that I wanted a cook's tour of the department, who took me around, showed me the facilities, gave me some statistics, said these are our three big challenges today, immediately perceived and was able to give me a kind of executive summary.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.822
The one who made the worst impression.

04:40.942 --> 04:43.365
What was that best one?

04:43.733 --> 04:47.603
Oh, the best one was Doug Starr in journalism.

04:47.623 --> 04:50.491
He immediately knew what I needed.

04:52.216 --> 04:55.043
The one who made the worst impression, I will not name.

04:56.170 --> 05:04.219
either by department or by name, but was a person who was much admired and knew it very well.

05:04.279 --> 05:09.626
And when I asked my question, he said, I have no idea what you need to do.

05:09.646 --> 05:12.249
That's for you to figure out.

05:12.269 --> 05:14.091
I thought, thanks a lot.

05:14.111 --> 05:18.276
Were there some female department heads in liberal arts?

05:18.536 --> 05:20.318
There was one at that time.

05:20.378 --> 05:21.840
Her name was Mary Zye.

05:22.934 --> 05:23.735
In sociology.

05:23.915 --> 05:24.936
In sociology.

05:25.177 --> 05:30.402
She was, I believe at that time, the only female department head in the university.

05:34.187 --> 05:44.539
And as you and your husband became a part of this community, describe what social activities you all got involved in early.

05:45.359 --> 05:45.420
Ah.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.243
Either by choice or by responsibility.

05:48.423 --> 05:48.503
Yes.

05:49.985 --> 05:59.159
We quickly became part of the dinner party kind of social life of this community.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.642
You have a couple or two over.

06:01.323 --> 06:03.246
Someone else has a couple or two over.

06:04.187 --> 06:12.280
We attended the symphony concerts very quickly and regularly and any other musical events.

06:13.222 --> 06:16.667
We attended Aggie Players.

06:16.647 --> 06:18.970
regularly and often.

06:19.150 --> 06:20.411
I have not kept that up.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.553
It's not because I didn't like it.

06:23.855 --> 06:26.297
It's, you know, what happens to your time.

06:26.858 --> 06:27.719
What about athletics?

06:28.900 --> 06:31.063
Oh, not much.

06:31.323 --> 06:32.764
You didn't?

06:32.784 --> 06:39.211
Were there any social events that you kind of felt, as an associate dean, you were obligated to attend?

06:39.632 --> 06:40.072
Oh, yes.

06:40.172 --> 06:43.376
Lectures in the college, certainly.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.477
I mean, that's...

06:44.744 --> 06:50.755
One might drive great pleasure from it, but I didn't even think about that as a social event.

06:50.775 --> 06:52.418
That was work.

06:52.438 --> 06:58.669
And who became your closest colleague friend or friends?

06:59.611 --> 07:05.517
Paul Parrish and Charlie Johnson were my fellow associate deans at that time.

07:05.537 --> 07:07.379
Paul Parrish is from English and Charlie Johnson.

07:07.399 --> 07:07.859
He's from English.

07:07.879 --> 07:11.703
He's now dean of liberal arts and we had offices.

07:11.903 --> 07:12.744
His department of what?

07:12.764 --> 07:14.106
He was political science.

07:14.706 --> 07:14.806
Okay.

07:14.826 --> 07:16.728
He was political science.

07:16.748 --> 07:18.790
Our offices were very close to each other.

07:18.830 --> 07:24.336
We talked a lot and also

07:24.316 --> 07:27.491
Chuck Staup, our Saba in Liberal Arts.

07:28.395 --> 07:28.696
Spelling.

07:28.716 --> 07:33.398
S-A-B-O, Staup is S-T-O-U-P as in Paul.

07:33.479 --> 07:36.321
He was a senior academic business administrator.

07:39.504 --> 07:44.328
But he had been on the faculty himself for a few years.

07:44.989 --> 07:48.292
So he had a dual perspective on things.

07:49.333 --> 07:56.759
And I quickly came to feel that Chuck was a person to talk with when I was puzzling over what to do.

07:57.060 --> 08:02.204
Not necessarily the business matters, but general wisdom.

08:02.364 --> 08:03.385
You have to have

08:04.462 --> 08:06.004
a sounding board or two.

08:06.625 --> 08:09.008
Now you served as associate dean for how long?

08:09.829 --> 08:16.238
For a total of seven years if you count the one year that I had my misadventure going to Auburn.

08:18.281 --> 08:18.521
All right.

08:19.342 --> 08:24.889
Now during that time were children here or were they elsewhere?

08:25.450 --> 08:29.035
Our kids were all elsewhere.

08:29.943 --> 08:42.639
My youngest son, Steven, had just started college that year at Rice, and so he would come home for the summers or for holiday occasions, but we had no offspring living with us.

08:43.801 --> 08:51.831
We are very quiet people, probably less involved in the community than you would be, for example.

08:51.851 --> 08:52.972
You're very outgoing.

08:53.272 --> 08:55.275
What did you all do for relaxation?

08:56.082 --> 09:08.762
We would rush home after work in the evening, eat a simple dinner, work a crossword puzzle, and work on our books or articles until about 1030, and that's what we still do.

09:10.365 --> 09:12.128
Okay.

09:12.208 --> 09:16.234
No big vacation trips?

09:17.632 --> 09:32.351
We would get away every summer on a vacation trip, usually take a little pop-up camper behind our car and go visit my husband's parents in Nebraska and go camp out in Rocky Mountain National Park.

09:34.193 --> 09:40.521
What were the joys, what were the satisfaction experiences of being an associate dean?

09:40.541 --> 09:42.964
I felt that I could make a difference.

09:43.703 --> 09:44.785
Not always.

09:44.805 --> 09:54.941
I mean, there were times of frustration because an associate dean is a what we would call a staff position, not a line position, and you know the difference between those.

09:55.682 --> 10:05.677
There were times where I thought we should be doing something different to be just to somebody, to be fair to somebody, and I couldn't make that call.

10:06.118 --> 10:08.682
My boss could.

10:08.662 --> 10:16.556
I can remember a few cases that I went home in the evening and cried over them and I should have remembered that before I became dean of faculties too.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.824
But I could sometimes make a difference.

10:21.485 --> 10:26.855
I helped found what is now the Women Faculty Network.

10:27.256 --> 10:28.358
Describe that.

10:29.249 --> 10:34.810
It seemed to me that there were women scattered around this university who were very isolated.

10:34.850 --> 10:40.491
I had very early started looking at the statistics on where the women were.

10:41.416 --> 10:44.921
And I could see just with the numbers that there was a lot of isolation.

10:45.802 --> 10:51.010
And I was talking with Mary Zai, who was our department head in sociology.

10:52.512 --> 10:57.198
And she and I agreed that we should try to get women together so they could get acquainted.

10:58.120 --> 11:06.732
So we got a list of the women faculty, and we hand addressed invitations to a luncheon in the MSC.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.866
We had two women come and talk about their research for the program.

11:13.767 --> 11:22.797
That was very deliberately done because everyone always talked about, oh, women are wonderful teachers, which may or may not be true.

11:23.078 --> 11:24.139
It's frequently true.

11:26.181 --> 11:30.106
But very seldom would people talk about women are wonderful researchers.

11:30.626 --> 11:31.968
And that may be just as true.

11:32.889 --> 11:33.870
So we had that.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.313
And then we organized another luncheon.

11:37.188 --> 11:44.498
And by then we retired, and somebody else organized the next one, and it got going.

11:45.380 --> 11:56.675
Did the numbers and percentages of women faculty here, was it much different from the same percentages at similar institutions elsewhere?

11:57.276 --> 12:00.000
Other, say other land grant, other separate land grant?

12:00.060 --> 12:03.124
Somewhat lower, but not drastically lower.

12:06.189 --> 12:07.110
We are...

12:07.934 --> 12:09.137
And this is still true.

12:10.099 --> 12:14.851
The representation of women is lower than at institutions across the country.

12:14.891 --> 12:22.990
Land grant, I don't know that I've ever separated out well enough to make a really good comparison.

12:23.746 --> 12:41.914
But I think also the women in this university are clumped because of discipline and also certainly then and to some extent still tend to be more junior than it places across the country.

12:42.215 --> 12:43.657
And it's easy to understand that.

12:43.998 --> 12:46.902
Our faculty is very senior.

12:47.742 --> 12:57.235
I mean, out of 1,710 tenured and tenure track faculty last fall, right at 900 were full professors.

12:58.236 --> 13:03.903
So you don't change the percentage of a group of 900 very quickly.

13:04.544 --> 13:10.812
When I came here, three and a fraction percent of our full professors were female.

13:11.513 --> 13:14.998
Three and a fraction percent.

13:14.978 --> 13:18.303
Now it's 6.5% or 6.75%.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.809
That's after 12 years.

13:22.830 --> 13:34.749
That sounds slow, but when you think that the N, the denominator in the fraction, is almost 900, and a lot of those people have been here a long time, then you can understand it.

13:35.731 --> 13:39.096
You see, I think that comparisons would be most appropriate

13:39.447 --> 13:44.773
for separate land-grant schools, Auburn, NC State, Virginia Tech.

13:44.793 --> 13:46.434
Yeah, yeah.

13:46.454 --> 13:48.657
K-State, Oklahoma State, and so forth.

13:48.677 --> 13:55.644
Right, and those data are available, and I haven't spent the time poring over them.

13:55.844 --> 14:04.814
We, there's less difference, of course, there, although still some difference.

14:04.874 --> 14:08.037
If you talk like Kansas State,

14:08.017 --> 14:20.412
If you talk like Davis, which is a very comparable land grant, talk NC State, I believe we are still somewhat lower.

14:20.672 --> 14:25.478
If you compare us to Auburn, I doubt that we are lower at all.

14:27.139 --> 14:30.143
As you became a part of this community, what?

14:30.612 --> 14:34.567
What impressed you most about the institution, plus or minus in general?

14:35.731 --> 14:38.361
The faculty, the students, the attitude, and so forth?

14:39.370 --> 14:42.433
Oh, the attitude of open possibility.

14:42.834 --> 14:45.957
That was what had struck me when I came here for an interview.

14:46.638 --> 14:48.180
And that's what stayed with me.

14:50.002 --> 14:55.808
That this place was unlimited in where it could go.

14:55.829 --> 15:03.938
And certainly a confidence that it was already a very good institution, which I've always believed and wouldn't be here if I didn't believe it.

15:04.859 --> 15:07.842
But the sense that we could be even better.

15:08.800 --> 15:24.706
I think we are almost unique in our ability to change, and the change has been drastic, but to change while still keeping hold of great elements of sameness.

15:26.609 --> 15:34.302
As you interacted with the students, how would you compare those with the students you had known at Rice?

15:35.648 --> 15:40.516
That's a very interesting question and one that was very important to me from early on.

15:43.461 --> 15:56.702
We have many students who are every bit as good as any of the students at Rice or at Bryn Mawr where I had been at one time previously.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.188
But we also have a broader swath

16:00.995 --> 16:01.779
of students.

16:03.086 --> 16:09.317
And I think that is a good and constructive thing on the whole, and I'm glad that we do.

16:10.175 --> 16:14.903
I believe in democracy, small d democracy.

16:15.324 --> 16:22.977
And that doesn't mean that you throw the doors open and anyone who shows up comes in.

16:23.338 --> 16:34.276
But I think people learn more and learn better when they are dealing with a broader swath of the human population.

16:34.316 --> 16:35.338
We have that here.

16:36.145 --> 16:51.876
Did you find in general that the senior administrators above you, particularly in those first years, seemed to be willing to consider new ideas, seemed to be open?

16:55.045 --> 16:57.389
And the answer is certainly yes.

16:58.451 --> 17:11.772
I think sometimes the central administration was a little bit taken aback by the dean of liberal arts being maybe a little too different.

17:13.118 --> 17:15.983
and wanting to push the envelope a little too much.

17:16.404 --> 17:23.216
As far as you were aware, in those liberal arts years, which deans had the most clout on the campus?

17:23.236 --> 17:27.104
Oh, well, the dean of engineering and the dean of agriculture.

17:27.845 --> 17:28.827
Certainly that was true.

17:29.067 --> 17:31.752
I mean, it was just very obvious.

17:32.012 --> 17:35.599
Then after them, were there any others?

17:36.288 --> 17:42.960
It was never clear to me, really, how the, shall we say, the pecking order went.

17:43.201 --> 17:45.605
I was not sure if it was the dean of science.

17:46.106 --> 17:51.857
I was inclined to think it was the dean of science next, but maybe it was dean of business.

17:51.957 --> 17:54.702
I just wasn't sure there.

17:55.103 --> 18:07.556
like I've thought as an observer down through the years, sometimes, other than those first two, sometimes it depends on the personality of the individual dean or the college they represent.

18:08.057 --> 18:09.058
Yeah, yeah.

18:09.158 --> 18:11.580
But not necessarily one and the same.

18:11.761 --> 18:15.244
But with agriculture and engineering, there's not any doubt, right.

18:15.264 --> 18:19.609
All right, so you served as an associate dean of liberal arts how long?

18:21.800 --> 18:27.787
I was an associate dean of liberal arts for seven years including my one year at Auburn.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.570
All right, and you went to Auburn briefly to do what?

18:33.052 --> 18:34.974
We thought we wanted to make another change.

18:35.615 --> 18:41.161
I didn't think this was the place I wanted to stay and my husband didn't either.

18:41.221 --> 18:49.410
And so we both went on the job market and we agreed we'd see what we could work out whoever got the first

18:50.487 --> 19:00.166
And we tried to apply where there were two possibilities, you know, where we could see it working, because it's hard.

19:01.288 --> 19:06.538
It so happened that Auburn was advertising for head of the Department of Civil Engineering.

19:06.518 --> 19:13.926
and also for dean of the College of Liberal Arts, not associate dean, but dean.

19:13.966 --> 19:16.609
And we both applied, and we were both asked for interviews.

19:16.749 --> 19:21.875
I mean, I think it was like two weeks apart we got these phone calls asking us for interviews.

19:22.976 --> 19:27.001
For dean of liberal arts, I was one of only two finalists.

19:27.061 --> 19:34.669
There had been a third, but he had gotten tired of waiting around for the search to get finished, and he took a job somewhere else.

19:35.459 --> 19:44.694
There was an internal candidate, and there was I. And when I went for the interview, I think I had a very good interview.

19:45.795 --> 19:54.529
And the internal candidate sat and talked with me and sort of made noises that he might just pull out.

19:54.930 --> 19:58.716
He asked me if I would consider him to be my associate dean.

20:00.080 --> 20:05.708
And his friends later told me that he really had said he was going to pull out, and they talked him into staying.

20:07.030 --> 20:07.972
He was chosen dean.

20:10.235 --> 20:11.096
And he deserved it.

20:11.517 --> 20:12.819
He'd been a good department head.

20:13.119 --> 20:14.762
He'd been speaker of the faculty senate.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.684
It was the right thing for them to do.

20:18.527 --> 20:23.074
In the meantime, my husband had been offered the headship of the Department of Civil Engineering.

20:23.975 --> 20:26.038
The dean there was someone we'd known at Rice.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.602
They knew and respected each other.

20:30.218 --> 20:36.051
Lauren didn't really want to be an administrator, but he thought he could work with Bill Walker pretty well.

20:37.976 --> 20:39.399
And he wanted to accept the job.

20:41.384 --> 20:42.927
But I was not chosen as dean.

20:44.431 --> 20:48.480
The new dean phoned me and said, would I come as associate dean?

20:50.401 --> 20:55.027
And that was a bitter pill to swallow because I didn't want to be associate dean anymore.

20:55.708 --> 21:00.614
But Lauren had come here for me and it seemed right that I should go there for him.

21:02.096 --> 21:02.877
So I said I would.

21:04.559 --> 21:06.721
Then the dean called back and said, guess what?

21:06.922 --> 21:12.729
My affirmative action officer won't let me hire you as associate dean because we haven't met a search yet.

21:14.391 --> 21:19.277
So would you come as acting associate dean or interim, whichever it was?

21:20.776 --> 21:25.841
That was really a bitter pill to swallow because I knew Auburn was not as good an institution as we are.

21:26.381 --> 21:33.949
And not only was I going at the same rank, but I was dropping because there was that acting or interim.

21:33.969 --> 21:35.831
But we went and we bought a house.

21:35.931 --> 21:37.813
We went in good faith, meaning to stay.

21:39.194 --> 21:45.580
Both of our deans at Texas A&M knew that this was a volatile situation.

21:46.681 --> 21:50.445
And both of them gave us leave of absence here.

21:50.813 --> 21:55.478
And both of the deans at Auburn knew that we had the leave of absence here.

21:55.618 --> 22:00.083
So, so all four deans knew and that's the only honorable way to do it.

22:01.785 --> 22:08.111
We went and they did their search and they offered me the associate dean position.

22:09.513 --> 22:13.657
But Auburn has a very peculiar culture.

22:15.099 --> 22:19.183
They are not used to their administrators necessarily having faculty positions.

22:20.648 --> 22:34.573
In fact, their chief academic officer right before the one who was there at the time had come without a faculty position and had been turned down by two different departments and never had a faculty position.

22:35.245 --> 22:40.035
But the new dean over there said, well, I have the job to offer you.

22:40.055 --> 22:43.682
And I said, what about my faculty position?

22:45.145 --> 22:49.895
And I will not do it if I am a faculty member.

22:50.055 --> 22:51.157
That is my identity.

22:52.260 --> 22:52.981
I don't go anywhere.

22:53.001 --> 22:54.925
I don't have a faculty position.

22:54.905 --> 22:59.450
And he said, well, put yourself up to the English department.

22:59.470 --> 23:06.378
Now, that was the point at which I goofed up, because I should have said, no, you put me up to the English department.

23:07.099 --> 23:08.561
But he just tossed me in.

23:10.443 --> 23:23.258
And I found out later that people, well, at least one specific person who did American literature there, walked the halls and lobbied

23:23.913 --> 23:28.539
her colleagues saying, if you vote for her, you are voting against me.

23:28.619 --> 23:30.342
She'll be more senior than I am.

23:31.063 --> 23:32.565
She will get the graduate students.

23:32.745 --> 23:33.566
I won't get any.

23:34.948 --> 23:38.352
And the vote was close, but the vote was negative.

23:38.372 --> 23:41.837
And we gave in our letters of recommendation the next day.

23:43.299 --> 23:48.486
Great irony of that was that my husband, who had not wanted to be an administrator,

23:49.276 --> 23:54.970
had liked his job better than he ever expected, had done wonderfully.

23:56.333 --> 23:59.761
And that meant he stepped out of that job.

24:00.944 --> 24:01.686
We came back.

24:01.866 --> 24:03.370
And I've been so thankful.

24:04.025 --> 24:04.225
Right.

24:04.245 --> 24:06.188
You came back as associate dean.

24:06.448 --> 24:07.850
I came back as associate dean.

24:07.890 --> 24:09.031
I had not expected to.

24:09.051 --> 24:12.195
I had leave of absence from my faculty position.

24:12.315 --> 24:16.781
I had thought, whoop-dee-doo, I'll come back as a real professor.

24:17.021 --> 24:25.151
And Woodrow Jones was just going into his interim year before his permanent position.

24:25.312 --> 24:29.497
And he said, would I please come back as associate dean for him?

24:29.557 --> 24:30.898
And I said, I'll do one year.

24:31.559 --> 24:33.762
And this is 80 or 90?

24:34.147 --> 24:38.301
93, 94 was the year we came back.

24:38.522 --> 24:39.646
Okay.

24:40.148 --> 24:43.178
Did your task, when you came back, had it changed?

24:43.597 --> 24:48.463
No, I stepped back into doing the same thing I was, the faculty affairs graduate programs.

24:49.264 --> 24:59.958
Woody relied on us very heavily in that year because he was new in the role and he wasn't sure he had the role, you know, I mean an interim.

24:59.978 --> 25:06.246
And so, and you were in that role for how long before you became dean of faculties?

25:07.188 --> 25:08.970
I only stayed that one more year.

25:09.030 --> 25:11.453
That's all I had promised to do, and that's all I did.

25:12.134 --> 25:16.880
I went back to be, being a true professor in English.

25:17.781 --> 25:19.463
First time in my life, really.

25:21.165 --> 25:23.589
And I was happy as a clam.

25:24.530 --> 25:30.377
And then this announcement was made of being a faculty and I couldn't resist.

25:30.897 --> 25:34.381
And did, were you nominated, did you apply, or both?

25:34.841 --> 25:44.192
I, people asked me was I going to be a candidate, and I said no, and then others would ask, and I'd say no, and finally I said I'll think about it, and then I applied.

25:45.113 --> 25:49.077
And the vacancy came because Bill Perry was promoted?

25:49.718 --> 25:52.321
To executive associate provost, that's right.

25:53.522 --> 25:58.968
Describe the search process for the dean of faculty then, as far as you recall.

25:59.929 --> 26:00.550
About how many?

26:00.884 --> 26:02.567
Do you have any idea how many people they consider?

26:02.587 --> 26:05.732
I do not know how many total candidates there were.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.476
There were three finalists.

26:08.536 --> 26:09.678
All local?

26:09.698 --> 26:10.219
All local.

26:10.259 --> 26:12.562
The dean of faculties is always a local person.

26:13.143 --> 26:20.134
There's never been someone hired from outside as dean of faculties, and I think that tradition will be maintained.

26:23.460 --> 26:26.284
But we were put through our usual paces.

26:26.264 --> 26:39.060
The toughest single group that I had to talk to were the Distinguished Professors, Executive Committee of the Distinguished Professors, and the second toughest group was the Executive Committee in the Faculty Senate.

26:40.022 --> 26:42.445
What was tough about each of those?

26:42.465 --> 26:50.635
Distinguished Professors very much had their own agenda and

26:51.037 --> 26:55.329
They were kind of aggressive about wanting to talk about it.

26:55.970 --> 26:59.440
They were not laid back in any sense.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.643
What were their key concerns?

27:01.325 --> 27:06.278
The status of soft money researchers on the campus.

27:06.258 --> 27:26.848
and their wish that they could have free discretion in the paying of those, whereas we require that they be in job classifications and subject to comparable policies as people who are paid from

27:26.828 --> 27:28.009
state funds.

27:28.910 --> 27:35.616
And you can say there's unfairness the way it is, but there certainly would be unfairness if it were another way.

27:35.696 --> 27:38.839
And they were not pleased that I said so.

27:39.379 --> 27:42.342
What about the Faculty Senate?

27:42.362 --> 27:48.488
Well, the Faculty Senate, of course, had many issues in mind, as a Faculty Senate always should have.

27:49.789 --> 27:52.551
And I guess I kind of irritated them.

27:53.832 --> 27:54.473
I'm sorry.

27:56.039 --> 27:57.984
I, let's stop a minute.

27:59.468 --> 28:01.533
Okay, I remember the moment very well.

28:03.338 --> 28:09.795
So I told them in our session that I had some fears that the Faculty Senate

28:10.400 --> 28:19.877
had fallen away from one of its most important missions, which is the mission of raising significant issues.

28:20.818 --> 28:28.131
You could say being a gadfly, and I don't think it's necessarily being a gadfly, but raising significant issues.

28:28.452 --> 28:35.344
I was concerned that the Faculty Senate had become so institutionalized

28:35.510 --> 28:48.798
that it had become bogged in routine processing and was not stepping back and taking the independent look and asking questions the way the early Senate had.

28:49.659 --> 28:53.367
And I don't think they had expected someone in that interview to

28:54.292 --> 28:57.295
to challenge the role of the Senate in that way.

28:57.835 --> 29:00.898
And they were kind of, shall we say, shook up.

29:00.919 --> 29:06.524
But those were the two hard interview sessions, I think.

29:07.945 --> 29:09.887
And about how many finalists were there?

29:10.508 --> 29:11.469
There were three finalists.

29:11.489 --> 29:11.849
Three finalists.

29:11.889 --> 29:13.211
Three of us were interviewed.

29:13.291 --> 29:14.272
I think that's right.

29:15.433 --> 29:16.394
As far as you know.

29:16.474 --> 29:17.295
May have been four.

29:18.576 --> 29:22.780
As far as you know, who made the decision as to who would be selected?

29:22.844 --> 29:28.652
Well, the search committee made a recommendation, but the provost definitely made the decision.

29:28.672 --> 29:30.334
And it was the current provost?

29:30.354 --> 29:30.935
Ron Douglas.

29:31.035 --> 29:31.596
Ron Douglas.

29:32.237 --> 29:40.548
I well remember my conversation with him during the interview process because I, he was entirely a cipher to me.

29:40.568 --> 29:41.950
I did not know him.

29:42.731 --> 29:44.574
I didn't know much about him.

29:44.594 --> 29:49.020
I had seen him only in university faculty meetings.

29:50.013 --> 29:56.106
And a large meeting like that is never the context in which this provost shines best.

29:56.667 --> 30:01.037
He shines best in small group and individual sessions.

30:01.919 --> 30:06.368
And so I didn't have much of an opinion formed of him until

30:06.837 --> 30:21.120
this hour-long conversation, and he impressed me as a person who thought long and carefully about the big issues of higher education in a national perspective.

30:22.161 --> 30:29.993
Obviously, yes, this institution, but in the context of the big issues of higher education nationally.

30:30.955 --> 30:32.878
I immediately admired that.

30:33.432 --> 30:46.472
During this interview process, did you get the impression that anybody had any preconceived notions of what the next dean of faculties must do or must not do?

30:47.013 --> 30:47.233
No.

30:47.914 --> 30:52.401
I had been a candidate when Bill Perry was selected for dean of faculties.

30:52.421 --> 30:55.686
I probably should have mentioned that sooner.

30:56.488 --> 31:01.195
And I think in that search, there were preconceived positions.

31:01.985 --> 31:11.321
At that time, there was a very active discourse of, should the dean of faculty be an ombudsperson or not?

31:11.341 --> 31:16.871
Should the dean of faculties have the tie with the provost or not?

31:16.891 --> 31:24.043
And the way I remember that earlier search was that I would have a very clear sense when
