WEBVTT

00:04.317 --> 00:08.481
with you if we donate this to the oral history 
collection at Texas A&M? Yes, it is. Okay. Which of

00:11.764 --> 00:13.125
the forces were you in? I was in the United States 
Army. And what division and unit? I was attached to

00:21.253 --> 00:23.955
the 2 Field Force. It's Roman numeral 2 Field 
Force. And I was assigned to the Two Field Force

00:32.768 --> 00:37.992
Artillery, which was a brigade-sized artillery 
unit. Okay, and what was your title? I was the legal

00:40.775 --> 00:43.997
officer for the artillery brigade. Okay, and what 
was your rank? First Lieutenant. And what dates

00:48.701 --> 00:50.223
were you in Vietnam?

00:55.247 --> 01:02.353
May the 31st, 1970

00:55.247 --> 01:02.353
through...

01:04.747 --> 01:07.510
January the 19th, 1971. Where were you stationed? 
I was stationed at a place called Plantation. It

01:13.075 --> 01:31.632
was right outside of Long Ben, which was a large 
United States military installation, and right

01:13.075 --> 01:31.632
by the city, Benoit City, which was a Vietnamese 
city, town. How did you end up in Vietnam? Were you

01:35.982 --> 01:38.265
drafted or did you enlist? No, I was ROTC at the 
University of Texas. Okay. How much did you know

01:43.671 --> 01:45.874
about the war before you left?

01:49.458 --> 01:55.746
Oh, probably not any more than anyone else that 
watched TV and read the newspaper at that time. I

01:57.047 --> 02:01.112
really didn't keep up with it a lot. I would watch TV 
and read the newspaper, and that's about all I know

02:02.172 --> 02:07.237
about it. Do you think it affected you that you 
entered the war after the Tet Offensive and all the

02:07.257 --> 02:13.424
news coverage of that? Do you think you would have 
had a different perspective before that? Oh, I

02:18.509 --> 02:22.593
don't think so. I think probably the Tet Offensive 
would have, It might have changed my outlook a

02:28.582 --> 02:36.009
little bit on Vietnam and serving in Vietnam. 
Probably would have been more of an incentive to be

02:37.130 --> 02:41.314
there. Okay. When you left, what training were you 
given?

02:50.483 --> 02:57.010
We had what was called RVN training, Republic of 
Vietnam training. It was basically orientation

02:58.957 --> 03:20.437
on the country and the culture of the country, 
something about the people, a little bit about

02:58.957 --> 03:20.437
staying alive and

02:58.957 --> 03:20.437
it was a week training, one week training at Fort 
Hood where I was stationed when I left. Did you know

03:21.358 --> 03:27.023
any Vietnamese at all or just a brief kind of 
overview of their culture? Not really. I didn't

03:28.119 --> 03:34.645
know very much about Vietnam at all when I went 
there. What was your first perception of Vietnam?

03:41.892 --> 03:47.257
Well, it was, it appeared to me to be a very backward 
country. It was very flat where I was.

03:55.625 --> 03:56.166
Dirty.

04:02.086 --> 04:03.608
with a Vietnamese person?

04:09.878 --> 04:30.388
I was, I shared an office with, my office was in a 
building that I shared with, with the civil

04:09.878 --> 04:30.388
affairs officer for our brigade and he, he had a 
Vietnamese, he had a counter, his counterpart

04:09.878 --> 04:30.388
with the the Republic of Vietnam, the Army of the 
Republic of Vietnam, was a Sergeant Ahn. That was

04:38.625 --> 04:46.737
my first encounter on a personal basis with any 
Vietnamese.

04:47.598 --> 04:49.741
He spoke English very well. He was very polite.

04:53.266 --> 04:55.809
Really a nice guy. Was it hard to adjust to daily 
life in Vietnam?

05:01.587 --> 05:02.128
Not really. We worked all the time. We worked seven 
days a week from seven in the morning until five in

05:04.650 --> 05:09.194
the evening. So there was, you know, you were just 
busy. You were working all the time, so it really

05:14.920 --> 05:23.468
wasn't too hard to adjust.

05:23.528 --> 05:30.835
I was not out in the field, so I was not out in the 
field a lot, so I was really in an office type job and

05:23.528 --> 05:30.835
really didn't have much problem adjusting to just 
doing my job. Do you think it was hard on the people

05:34.571 --> 05:38.775
in the field because they weren't always busy? You 
know, fighting was maybe one day out of a month or

05:41.117 --> 05:43.459
whatever. I think it was a little different when I 
was there. I think that war was winding down. And it

05:51.847 --> 06:00.855
probably, there probably was some boredom and 
some feelings of uselessness helplessness

06:01.291 --> 06:04.957
because the people are not busy every day. They, 
you know, they may be doing things that will make

06:04.977 --> 06:14.372
work type activities or tasks. As a legal officer, 
what were your duties?

06:21.404 --> 06:25.290
I prosecuted

06:27.734 --> 06:43.595
For the brigade, we were a special court martial 
jurisdiction, which meant that the commanding

06:27.734 --> 06:43.595
officer of the brigade was a one-star general, or 
he was actually a full colonel general designate.

06:44.817 --> 06:52.527
And he had authority to sentence up to six months in 
the confinement in a stockade. So I prosecuted

06:53.435 --> 07:20.978
primarily those cases, handled the 
administrative portion or supervised

06:53.435 --> 07:20.978
administrative portion of the court-martials at 
the special court-martial level, and advised the

06:53.435 --> 07:20.978
commanding officer of our brigade on the legal 
affairs of the brigade and the prosecution of the

06:53.435 --> 07:20.978
cases within his court-martial jurisdiction. 
What did you find was the major difference between

07:21.852 --> 07:29.179
a court martial situation as opposed to the normal 
court system in the United States? Basically

07:29.840 --> 07:39.709
there's not any real difference between the two 
systems that follow essentially the same rules of

07:29.840 --> 07:39.709
evidence and same rules of procedure as the 
federal system. I would say that the biggest

07:40.610 --> 07:51.741
difference during the period of time that I was in 
the service was the

07:52.970 --> 08:13.049
refusal or the choice by the accused not to use a 
jury trial but to elect to be tried by military

07:52.970 --> 08:13.049
judges and sentenced by military judges as 
opposed to selecting a jury made up of military

07:52.970 --> 08:13.049
personnel. Most of the people chose to be tried and 
if they were convicted, sentenced by military

08:13.069 --> 08:18.794
judges. What type of charges did you bring against 
the soldiers? Oh, they ranged everywhere from I

08:23.665 --> 08:51.360
tried one negligent homicide case where a guy 
accidentally shot McGillie's best friend to all

08:23.665 --> 08:51.360
types of drug possession and use charges, 
marijuana, heroin, and military offenses such as

08:23.665 --> 08:51.360
insubordination, sleeping on guard duty, So they 
really range from failure to salute, fairly

08:52.707 --> 09:21.027
insignificant type violations of the military 
code of justice, to fairly significant charges,

08:52.707 --> 09:21.027
any of which could have been a general 
court-martial, which would be an unlimited

08:52.707 --> 09:21.027
jurisdiction, but for various reasons were tried 
at the special court-martial level, which had a

08:52.707 --> 09:21.027
limited sentencing jurisdiction. But I ran 
nearly the entire gamut of military violations.

09:30.178 --> 09:35.847
Were they given any, I guess, special treatment 
because of their psychological state during the

09:30.178 --> 09:35.847
war? I don't think so. I think there was probably a 
relaxing of the

09:37.189 --> 09:48.786
military... rules that is the fewer and fewer 
people were ever charged or tried or

09:50.504 --> 10:10.611
court-martialed, I guess, for military 
violations like failure to salute or

09:50.504 --> 10:10.611
insubordination or improper uniform or those 
kinds of things. Those rules were relaxed in

10:10.651 --> 10:14.516
Vietnam substantially. I think most of the 
offenses that were tried dealt with things that

10:20.508 --> 10:42.492
were perceived as something that might get you or 
your fellow soldiers killed, drug offenses, and

10:20.508 --> 10:42.492
weapons violations primarily, or somebody got 
hurt carelessly using a weapon.

10:42.952 --> 10:46.416
How big do you think the drug problem was during 
Vietnam? During the period of time I was there, it

10:46.436 --> 10:49.519
was extensive. It was readily available. The post 
I was on had a seven foot or seven or eight foot chain

10:56.331 --> 11:20.232
link fence around it with barbed wire around the 
top of it and Constantino wire around the bases out

10:56.331 --> 11:20.232
several feet and the Vietnamese kids would come up 
to the fence and throw marijuana over in a five

10:56.331 --> 11:20.232
pound plastic bag. what the price of it was, but it 
was relatively inexpensive, but it was very easy

11:22.068 --> 11:26.513
to get. Do you think the North Vietnamese 
contributed to it and helped the distribution?

11:35.644 --> 11:37.366
I don't have any real proof of that. I have an 
opinion that they probably did. I think it was

11:39.549 --> 11:50.522
psychologically to their advantage to make the 
drugs readily available, plus the fact they,

11:39.549 --> 11:50.522
although it was illegal to have, United States 
currency in Vietnam. Everyone was issued

11:53.184 --> 11:55.026
military script. Some people still had currency, 
and if you could get, say, a $50 bill would buy a lot

11:56.187 --> 12:11.540
more than $50 of military script of anything, 
whether it was drugs or contraband or anything of

11:56.187 --> 12:11.540
that nature. Primarily the North Vietnamese and 
the Viet Cong would be taking the United States

12:12.681 --> 12:20.087
currency to buy weapons. Why was there a drug 
problem in this war as opposed to other wars?

12:39.045 --> 12:40.747
It may have been a sign of our time. We may have had a 
drug problem not only in Vietnam but in the United

12:41.068 --> 12:48.657
States. or the beginning of a drug problem in the 
United States altogether. I think that it

12:54.930 --> 13:01.958
probably was not a popular war. I'm not sure that 
would contribute a lot to the use of drugs in

13:03.180 --> 13:19.420
Vietnam, as opposed to just the availability

13:03.180 --> 13:19.420
and relatively inexpensive availability of the 
drugs in Vietnam. We had many guest speakers in my

13:25.752 --> 13:36.747
class, and I noticed that those in the latter part 
of the war noticed a big drug problem while the ones

13:25.752 --> 13:36.747
at the first part of the war barely saw any. Do you 
think that was true, or is it just where they were

13:36.767 --> 13:40.412
stationed in their perception? No, I think that's 
probably true. Understanding I was only there to

13:44.799 --> 13:48.023
see it for a 10-month period. at a time which I felt, 
and I believe the war was winding down, a lack of

13:48.509 --> 14:07.902
military operations, a lack of actual day-to-day 
combat or military operations or maneuver time on

13:48.509 --> 14:07.902
the hands of the people over there. I think that 
that's a winding, a... result or characteristic

14:16.083 --> 14:19.147
of the winding down of the war. Idleness. What 
effect do you think drugs had on military

14:22.452 --> 14:27.339
operations?

14:30.764 --> 14:45.685
Well, I don't have any doubt that if you've got 
someone that's using drugs during a military

14:30.764 --> 14:45.685
operation, it's got to affect his ability to 
perform his job as it would anyone, whether you're

14:30.764 --> 14:45.685
a truck driver or you're you're driving a tank or 
trying to, in my case, fire an artillery piece.

14:57.120 --> 15:02.948
I think it will affect and did affect some of the 
military operations. I think the problem was more

15:03.870 --> 15:14.845
not during actual operations that people were 
using it, but in their free time, if you will, when

15:15.989 --> 15:24.361
they were not on an operation and they were on some 
kind of drug. Do you think the drug problem

15:24.381 --> 15:29.088
affected minorities any more or less than the 
white soldiers? I really can't answer that. I

15:32.333 --> 15:33.114
don't think so. Let me say, I did not perceive that 
you had a greater problem among blacks or

15:33.635 --> 15:45.692
Hispanics than you had among whites. I think we 
handled the process just as many all races. I don't

15:52.362 --> 16:02.314
think there was any line drawn between one 
particular minority or our minorities and anyone

15:52.362 --> 16:02.314
else. Did you see any cases of racial tension? A 
few. I think it was primarily the blacks felt like

16:06.919 --> 16:15.730
they were being discriminated against. It was a 
perception that I had and probably from the facts

16:16.874 --> 16:28.267
that they felt they did not get, or not that they did 
not get the good jobs, but they got the bad jobs.

16:31.230 --> 16:43.604
In a lack of acceptance of military discipline,

16:31.230 --> 16:43.604
I think that was part of the problem that created 
some of the racial tension that I saw. In some

16:43.965 --> 16:45.126
cases, We found out that the North Vietnamese 
dropped information to the black soldiers about,

16:45.393 --> 16:56.992
you know, you were enslaved and similar 
situations are going on in Vietnam. Did you see any

16:57.012 --> 16:58.154
of that? I did not see any of that literature. I 
mean, I believe that to be true because I know that

17:02.381 --> 17:09.011
that's what the civil affairs companies for the 
United States Army did over North Vietnam. They

17:09.031 --> 17:11.856
dropped leaflets all the time, so that was part of 
their job. I didn't see it in that literature, but I

17:12.983 --> 17:17.647
don't have any doubt that it probably existed. 
Okay, what did the Army do for those with a drug

17:19.068 --> 17:24.493
addiction?

17:24.513 --> 17:32.640
Well,

17:24.513 --> 17:32.640
they probably really didn't do very much during 
the period of time that I was there. I think that

17:32.700 --> 17:41.488
there was a recognition back in the United States 
that a problem and a huge problem was existing as a

17:41.755 --> 17:58.257
result of soldiers coming back to the United 
States with drug habits that they were not able to

17:41.755 --> 17:58.257
support in the United States just because of the 
cost, the difference in the cost of the drugs. And I

17:59.699 --> 18:09.332
know that there was an effort to counsel and 
educate and discipline for drug use and abuse.

18:14.227 --> 18:20.635
While I was there, I served on a particular 
committee that was made up of a doctor. I

18:21.936 --> 18:28.645
can't think of his name. Not his name, his title. He 
was a preacher. I can't think of

18:30.327 --> 18:37.897
it, Paige. Chaplain? Chaplain. He was a United 
States chaplain. and me as a lawyer, and we went to

18:41.189 --> 19:10.285
the various firing batteries in my brigade and 
tried to counsel and talk with and educate the

18:41.189 --> 19:10.285
soldiers about the use of drugs and the problems 
that they can encounter looking at it from a

18:41.189 --> 19:10.285
medical standpoint, a legal standpoint, and a 
religious standpoint. And I know that program was

19:11.665 --> 19:17.613
instituted while I was in Vietnam and carried out. 
We did do that. I don't know how successful it was,

19:19.455 --> 19:21.558
but we did do it. What sentences did you give those? 
Of course, like I said earlier, I had a very limited

19:27.786 --> 19:32.732
jurisdiction. Six months confinement in a 
stockade was the maximum that the jurisdiction I

19:32.832 --> 19:41.183
served in could administer, most of it would be, 
and that was one of the reasons that people took the

19:41.905 --> 20:04.212
military judges to impose sentences as opposed to 
military juries because they tended to be lesser

19:41.905 --> 20:04.212
sentences than would have been or were in fact 
administered by the jury. So most of the offenses

20:04.272 --> 20:10.900
would range from two to three months for drug 
possession primarily. And it all depended on

20:14.107 --> 20:16.831
whether this was a first or second offense. And two 
to three months of confinement with a loss of

20:17.953 --> 20:37.101
two-thirds pay for that period of time for a first 
offender with a hard drug, heroin, marijuana

20:17.953 --> 20:37.101
offender probably wouldn't get maybe 30 days, two 
months, depending on a lot of it, depending on how

20:17.953 --> 20:37.101
much they had. And

20:40.462 --> 20:42.044
But that was left strictly up to the judge. I really 
had no input into it. He made that decision. Which

20:45.889 --> 20:48.452
drug do you think was the worst in Vietnam?

20:51.116 --> 21:01.449
Well, I think the heroin was, obviously, was the 
worst, the most dangerous, and was readily

20:51.116 --> 21:01.449
available. It was cheap, and it was a lot stronger, 
a more pure grade of heroin than they were my

21:11.157 --> 21:15.582
understanding that people were able to buy once 
they got back to the United States. It was not cut

21:15.603 --> 21:23.312
nearly as much as what was sold on the streets in the 
United States back then. What effect do you think

21:23.332 --> 21:28.118
dealing with all these drug problems has on you 
today? I mean, do you take a stronger stance

21:28.138 --> 21:33.304
against drugs or maybe legalization of drugs? Oh, 
I don't know. I'm probably more intolerant of drug

21:35.968 --> 21:40.253
and drug abuse than I was Well, then I might 
otherwise have been, although I doubt it.

21:47.044 --> 21:51.871
I'm just not very tolerant of drug users or drug 
sellers.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.780
What percentage do you think were caught?

22:01.185 --> 22:01.846
Caught using? Mm-hmm, caught using drugs. A very 
small percentage. There were too many people over

22:06.472 --> 22:07.874
there. There were half a million men over there one 
time, and you just didn't handle very many of them.

22:15.023 --> 22:16.424
One percent, two percent. You said you had a 
limited field experience. When did you have to go?

22:21.609 --> 22:36.864
I went to,

22:21.609 --> 22:36.864
we had firing batteries that were stationed in 
various places in the field. When I arrived in

22:36.904 --> 22:38.826
Vietnam, the Cambodian, it was right in the middle 
of the Cambodian invasion, so our firing

22:39.498 --> 22:52.571
batteries were up on the Cambodian border 
supporting the Americans, which were over there

22:39.498 --> 22:52.571
for 30 days, but they pulled out right at the end of 
May. But the ARVN stayed up in Cambodia and our

22:53.312 --> 22:58.077
batteries supported up there. It was a lot easier 
for me to get out to the batteries than it was to

22:58.677 --> 23:06.265
bring or people in for me to counsel or that nature. 
So I wouldn't say that I went to the field a lot, but I

23:11.504 --> 23:23.278
was out maybe weekly to one battery or the other 
during the time that I was there. Sometimes we

23:23.458 --> 23:33.831
would go in Jeeps or trucks, but most of the time we 
flew

23:23.458 --> 23:33.831
in Alconca. Did you ever see any combat? No. Not to 
my knowledge. What was the hardest case for you to

23:40.351 --> 23:42.473
try? I

23:42.493 --> 23:49.360
think the negligent homicide case that I had over 
there. The kid just accidentally, you know, said

23:50.161 --> 23:58.368
they were sitting around in a hooch one night 
shooting a bull, and he pulled his .45 and killed

23:50.161 --> 23:58.368
his best friend. It was a tough case to try.

24:04.334 --> 24:05.395
What happened to the kid? He was found guilty and 
got six months in the stockade, which was the

24:06.083 --> 24:16.376
maximum he could have gotten under the

24:06.083 --> 24:16.376
special court martial jurisdiction. I think he 
was fortunate that he was, that the general court

24:16.396 --> 24:25.969
martial jurisdiction elected not to process him 
at that level because he could have gotten life.

24:28.392 --> 24:29.734
Well, probably not life, 10 years. Do you think he 
ever got over it from being on, or was he greatly

24:30.715 --> 24:34.420
affected? No, he was greatly affected. I don't 
remember the kid well. I remember he was from a

24:40.345 --> 24:45.351
Midwestern state, Missouri or somewhere like 
that. Average intelligence, but not a bad kid at

24:45.391 --> 24:50.678
all. Young, 19.

24:54.803 --> 24:55.924
And I think he was affected. I don't know that he was 
affected so much by Vietnam as he was the fact that

24:56.104 --> 25:01.791
he had killed somebody. What effect do you think 
the age, well, the difference in age, you'll say,

25:03.543 --> 25:12.934
between Vietnam and World War II had on the cases 
you tried and the numbers?

25:16.478 --> 25:21.884
Oh, I think that

25:16.478 --> 25:21.884
I'm not sure there was. There is a difference in age 
between the soldiers in World War II and in

25:21.924 --> 25:27.831
Vietnam. And this is my own perception. I perceive 
war to be a young thing. young men's game that it's

25:33.057 --> 25:58.885
easier to take 17, 18, 19, 20 year old kids and give 
them a rifle and send them off to war there they see a

25:33.057 --> 25:58.885
challenge to it as opposed to someone a little bit 
older that may not quite see that as being a

25:33.057 --> 25:58.885
glorious activity. I think that The age 
differential, I'm not sure that there really was

26:02.892 --> 26:06.716
one. Or there ever has been. I think young people 
sometimes tend to do dumb things. Whether that's

26:17.788 --> 26:27.459
drug abuse or running up a mountain or a hill with a 
rifle, screaming at somebody, that's another

26:17.788 --> 26:27.459
thing. I don't think there's an age problem. I 
don't think it was an age that would cause more

26:33.453 --> 26:44.126
people to be processed or court-martialed in 
Vietnam than there would have been in World War II

26:33.453 --> 26:44.126
just because of the age. I don't think there's an 
age difference, really. Do you think you had a

26:47.791 --> 26:55.480
different perception because you had a family and 
you were older as opposed to a young soldier? And

26:55.500 --> 26:57.823
what do you think the difference was? No, I think I 
did. I very definitely think I had a different

27:00.790 --> 27:03.073
view.

27:05.836 --> 27:11.262
I was not going to take any chances if I could keep 
from it.

27:11.883 --> 27:24.277
And by that, I meant I did not want to be out in the 
field with a rifle and walking around in the rice

27:11.883 --> 27:24.277
paddies or whatever trying to find Charlie. I 
think there were several people that served in

27:28.685 --> 27:31.508
Vietnam that truly enjoyed it. They liked it. I had 
a fellow that was in one of the units that I had

27:33.009 --> 27:45.962
jurisdiction over that I tried to recruit to come 
into my office. He was a black guy from South Texas.

27:49.925 --> 27:56.852
He had a college education and he would have made a 
very good legal clerk. job that I wanted him to do

27:57.052 --> 28:20.342
for me but he was a duster commander he had a duster 
which was a trapped vehicle that rode road guard

27:57.052 --> 28:20.342
for convoys and he liked to do that and he he would 
not even consider making the change

28:21.723 --> 28:27.050
What type of cases went up to the general court 
martial as opposed to your level?

28:29.774 --> 28:30.595
Second offenders.

28:35.762 --> 28:44.635
Cases that involved

28:35.762 --> 28:44.635
a homicide of some kind, generally. And

28:44.655 --> 28:51.544
anything that dealt with a breach of security.

28:56.384 --> 29:00.669
In the military system, any offense can be handled 
at any level. So they all can be up there. It just

29:03.173 --> 29:05.596
depends on whether you want to. The general court 
martial authority wants to handle those offenses

29:07.838 --> 29:24.079
at that level because of what he believes to be a 
serious problem as opposed to something that

29:07.838 --> 29:24.079
ought to be handled at a lower level because of 
special circumstances. Most of the cases that

29:24.464 --> 29:39.042
went up would be second offenders, people that 
were destined to be removed from the military with

29:24.464 --> 29:39.042
some kind of less than honorable discharge. If 
they get a general court-martial, then they were

29:39.062 --> 29:51.197
removed with

29:39.062 --> 29:51.197
dishonorable discharge or some sort of discharge 
that would be less than honorable. How long would

29:52.747 --> 29:55.531
it take to get your case tried?

29:59.436 --> 30:01.198
Really not very long. I could get most of my cases 
ready from the time that the charges come in from

30:02.940 --> 30:15.196
the field and are processed within 30 to 45 days. So 
much faster than the court system here. Yes. We

30:22.042 --> 30:31.710
probably didn't handle as many cases as they 
handled here, but we can get them ready for you. A

30:31.730 --> 30:34.072
lot of it was depending on the availability of the 
witnesses. If they were in a firing battery way up

30:34.132 --> 30:39.477
north somewhere, it was a little difficult to get 
them in. On a few occasions, I went to the field and

30:41.319 --> 30:50.867
tried to get to my court reporter and to the defense 
counsel and tried the case in the field if the

30:41.319 --> 30:50.867
military judge would do it. That was a rare 
occurrence, but sometimes when you had a lot of

30:52.214 --> 31:08.976
witnesses, it was a whole lot easier to move the 
courtroom to the field than it was to bring the

30:52.214 --> 31:08.976
witnesses back for a trial.

31:08.997 --> 31:09.197
Okay. I guess changing subjects. What did you do 
after 5 o'clock in Vietnam?

31:17.748 --> 31:21.293
I generally went to the...

31:22.184 --> 31:26.709
back to my room and change clothes. I really didn't 
change clothes. I kept the same clothes. I went to

31:31.534 --> 31:38.141
either the officer's open mess or the officer's 
club for dinner and I watched a movie almost every

31:31.534 --> 31:38.141
night. Did they bring in American movies? Just the 
ones that were showing or a lot of classics? No,

31:44.468 --> 31:50.875
mostly they would have

31:44.468 --> 31:50.875
mostly current movies, first-line, first-run 
movies. We watch movies almost every night. Do you

31:57.198 --> 31:58.401
enjoy movies now? Yeah, very much. Still?

32:03.091 --> 32:06.017
Have you seen a lot of movies about Vietnam? I've 
seen one or two. Full metal jacket. What did you

32:15.084 --> 32:16.126
think of it? No, it wasn't full metal jacket, it was 
the other one. Platoon? Platoon, I saw Platoon.

32:26.121 --> 32:28.584
It's kind of like a lot of movies that you see. I 
think probably at some time during the 15 years

32:28.685 --> 32:38.479
that the United States was in Vietnam, those 
things happened. I doubt very seriously that they

32:39.050 --> 32:45.019
happened to that one platoon, that all those 
things happened to that one platoon. They

32:45.059 --> 32:55.595
condensed all of the horrible things or the good 
things that they can show in movies into an hour and

32:45.059 --> 32:55.595
45 minutes and happening to one small group of 
people. It didn't bother me. It didn't affect me. I

32:58.099 --> 33:02.505
looked at it as just a movie. How did you think they 
dealt with drug use? Do you think it was very

33:06.071 --> 33:07.673
accurate?

33:10.808 --> 33:13.251
I'm not sure I remember how they dealt with it in the 
movie. Do you remember? I think it was mostly in

33:13.912 --> 33:23.706
their hootches or whatever and no one was really 
caught and a lot of young kids. No, I think that's

33:23.766 --> 33:25.208
probably true. That's probably accurate. That's 
really what I was trying to describe to you a few

33:27.091 --> 33:36.985
minutes ago when I said I really didn't think that 
they used it in the field but when they would be back

33:27.091 --> 33:36.985
in their base. as probably a method of escape. What 
was the climate of Vietnam like? It's tropical.

33:47.322 --> 33:50.226
It's very hot, very humid. And during the rainy 
season, it rains every day harder

33:51.508 --> 34:01.301
than you can believe. And then during the dry 
season, it stays dry and hot and gets dusty. But

34:06.107 --> 34:07.309
it's hot all the time now. Was that hard to learn to 
deal with? No, it really wasn't. Once, at least for

34:11.819 --> 34:26.975
me, once I acclimated myself to the change from a 
rather dry climate to a tropical, subtropical

34:11.819 --> 34:26.975
climate, it wasn't any problem. How much do you 
know about the military strategy in action? Did

34:32.141 --> 34:37.887
you ever learn anything about it while you were 
there, or did they keep you all totally... No, not

34:32.141 --> 34:37.887
really. I wasn't involved tactically in what was 
going on in Vietnam, so I didn't go to briefings, to

34:38.153 --> 34:50.826
the tactical briefings. I had my own private 
briefing with the general that was, the colonel

34:51.446 --> 35:08.143
that was in charge of our unit, and I didn't sit in on 
regular staff meetings, although I was on his

34:51.446 --> 35:08.143
staff, so I really didn't have any input or access 
to the tactical part of what was going on and other

35:09.119 --> 35:17.369
than what I read in the newspaper are left here on 
the radio. Did you get a military newspaper? We got

35:19.671 --> 35:27.440
a old, it was a, I guess you could call it a military 
newspaper. It was two or three pages of kind of

35:27.460 --> 35:31.205
what's factual data of what's going on. So it was 
very screened? Yes. Well, I assume it was. I'm

35:35.189 --> 35:36.831
assuming it was I'm not saying it was censored, but 
I think they put whatever they wanted to in it. Did

35:42.362 --> 35:45.786
you ever hear about the anti-war protesters while 
you were in Vietnam? Oh, yes. We had access to

35:47.107 --> 35:50.371
American television. We watched American 
television available, so we watched the news. How

35:57.959 --> 35:59.541
did you feel towards these people? Oh, I probably 
was...

36:09.127 --> 36:16.475
I probably had some ill feeling for them

36:09.127 --> 36:16.475
that I didn't like, didn't really like them. I 
thought they were probably not patriotic, maybe

36:17.896 --> 36:24.984
cowards.

36:31.231 --> 36:33.393
How did your wife feel about them? Hmm. I think she 
probably felt about the same way that I did about

36:38.270 --> 36:42.175
them. That we really didn't, we don't have much 
respect. We did not then and I don't today have much

36:48.222 --> 37:00.878
respect for those type, the people that were 
demonstrating and draft dodging and going to

36:48.222 --> 37:00.878
Canada or whatever. I'm not saying that I hold 
anything against folks that joined the National

37:00.978 --> 37:06.505
Guard. or just drew a lucky number and didn't get 
drafted. That's part of the luck of the deal. But I

37:13.524 --> 37:19.051
just don't have much respect for those two. Should 
we have allowed the media free access in Vietnam?

37:23.296 --> 37:24.197
Sure. I think so. I don't know. I felt like they had 
pretty free access to what was going on in Vietnam.

37:33.869 --> 37:35.952
And I certainly don't see any reason to keep them 
out. Should we have allowed other civilians that

37:36.674 --> 37:45.782
weren't media, such as, you know, like Jane Fonda, 
whenever that's the most famous, but a lot of the

37:36.674 --> 37:45.782
anti-war protesters? I think it's, you know, it's 
not good for morale to have someone who had some

37:47.404 --> 38:05.500
kind of national reputation in the United States 
over supporting the North Vietnamese.

38:09.310 --> 38:11.593
I don't think it's good. It is good for morale, but I 
don't really think that you can keep it out or you

38:11.993 --> 38:17.801
ought to keep them out. If they want to go over there 
and do that, that's fine. Maybe the remedy is

38:21.525 --> 38:25.811
something other than stopping them from going. 
Let them stay. Don't let them come back. What

38:29.435 --> 38:33.981
effect did television have on the war since this 
was the first televised war? I think it had

38:34.542 --> 38:36.364
significance. I don't own the war. It had a 
significant effect on the people that were

38:40.377 --> 38:43.460
involved in it. They knew more about what was going 
on in this war than participants in any other war, I

38:44.200 --> 39:06.802
suppose, on a daily basis because you could turn 
the TV on and watch the 6 o'clock news or the 5.30

38:44.200 --> 39:06.802
national news broadcast and find out more about 
what was going on in Vietnam, around Vietnam, and

38:44.200 --> 39:06.802
in the United States because of Vietnam. 
Probably... Well, not probably than any other war

39:08.761 --> 39:14.648
that I know

39:08.761 --> 39:14.648
of. What perception did the soldiers or you have of 
the different presidents? I guess for that time it

39:20.915 --> 39:25.661
was Nixon.

39:27.203 --> 39:29.285
Because, I mean, did television cloud that? I got 
to think about that. Was Nixon the president when I

39:31.268 --> 39:34.191
was there? When did Johnson go there? 
Sixty-eight.

39:39.068 --> 39:51.402
Well,

39:39.068 --> 39:51.402
I guess that we felt, I felt, let me just say what I 
felt. I felt like that Vietnam was a war that could

39:51.422 --> 39:59.592
have been won had we wanted to win the war. I don't 
know too much about what the political risk for an

40:05.815 --> 40:15.171
all out invasion, an all out effort to win that war 
would have caused around the world, if any, might

40:05.815 --> 40:15.171
not have caused anything.

40:18.677 --> 40:32.059
And I really felt like it was a situation where, had 
we have not been so concerned about our worldwide

40:18.677 --> 40:32.059
image and even maybe our image back at home, that 
war could have been over in six months to a year. So

40:37.224 --> 40:44.753
you think we should have been in Vietnam?

40:45.994 --> 40:49.358
I don't have an opinion whether we should have been 
there or we should not have been there. At the time,

40:52.122 --> 40:58.890
it was something that I had volunteered myself to 
do. decided, I made the decision when I joined,

40:59.410 --> 41:15.031
when I started in college, to join the ROTC knowing 
full well that when I got out of there, the chances,

40:59.410 --> 41:15.031
out of the school, the chances were better than 
50-50 that I would wind up in Vietnam.

41:17.715 --> 41:22.462
I looked at it as my job. And I went because I was told 
to go. I really made no judgment about whether we

41:28.840 --> 41:32.243
should have or should not have been there. If I look 
back on it now, the way we handled it, it probably

41:32.263 --> 41:40.272
was a mistake to have been there. Whether it 
affects our national security, whether it would

41:40.292 --> 41:55.287
have affected our national security back then, or 
some significant national interest that we had in

41:40.292 --> 41:55.287
preserving Vietnam, I really don't have a very 
good feeling for the fact that we were over

41:55.604 --> 42:05.405
there. Did that answer that?
