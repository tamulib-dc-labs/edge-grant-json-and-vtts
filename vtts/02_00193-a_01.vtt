Ray Wednesday chatting with Bob Skrabonik and sitting in his living room over at 1105 Berkeley in College Station we're testing our machine Bob check yours okay I hope this comes through okay Bob since some people may use these memories of yours and years to come

00:28.617 --> 00:30.960
and might not know about your background.

00:31.981 --> 00:40.490
Would you begin this by describing your family background, where you grew up, where you went to high school?

00:40.510 --> 00:45.696
What did you tell us about your life before you came to A&M to enroll as a student?

00:46.156 --> 00:46.537
Okay.

00:48.319 --> 00:54.726
I grew up in Snook, which is about 15 miles from today's present-day College Station.

00:55.043 --> 01:02.191
At that time, it was an all Czech community, a really self-contained little cultural island in which we spoke Czech.

01:02.271 --> 01:05.314
When I went to church, it was in that language.

01:06.055 --> 01:11.621
Everything, our catechism, the Bible, the sermons, everything was in Czech.

01:12.542 --> 01:21.692
So I think that had a lot of influence upon what happened to me as the days went along and how things life changed.

01:22.465 --> 01:41.283
At that time, and by the way, I was born in 1918, one week after the Armistice was signed, and my mother would supposedly have said that, boy, she's glad she got her boy, you know, a son, because he will never have to fight in a war again, ever.

01:42.365 --> 01:42.786
Anyway.

01:43.205 --> 01:47.213
Regardless of that, little did she know about what was going to happen in the future.

01:48.275 --> 01:52.483
So I started out there at that little community at Snook.

01:52.503 --> 01:59.095
At that time we had only nine grades at the local school.

01:59.155 --> 02:01.720
There were three rooms but nine grades.

02:02.392 --> 02:08.861
So typically, if we were going to get a high school diploma, we had to go somewhere else to school.

02:08.981 --> 02:12.546
And by the way, there were no hard surface roads.

02:13.848 --> 02:14.889
There was no running water.

02:15.530 --> 02:16.672
There was no electricity.

02:17.353 --> 02:20.457
And so it was brought up under the old days of things like that.

02:21.578 --> 02:24.282
And that had something to do with the fact also that

02:24.734 --> 02:46.447
Then when it came time for me to complete, you know, to finish there at Snook last year, I would say roughly of the kids that were, let's say, my age at that time, probably 90% of them left and went to Houston and didn't pursue further education.

02:48.010 --> 02:51.535
And they got jobs around Houston and places like that.

02:52.072 --> 03:12.224
And I might comment, parenthetically at least, that one of the things I'm really proud of is that bunch of people that I grew up with, while they didn't have all the education, all that sort of stuff, they just did remarkably, remarkably well, which I really attribute to, again, growing up in the conditions under which I grew up.

03:12.244 --> 03:14.147
Okay.

03:15.764 --> 03:21.491
So then in order to finish high school or get a diploma, I went to Caldwell to school.

03:21.952 --> 03:28.640
Now in those days, of course, again, there were no hard surface roads, and so we had no school buses.

03:29.641 --> 03:33.246
So it was pretty necessary for me to live in town in Caldwell.

03:34.868 --> 03:42.337
And particularly in the wintertime, there were a bunch of creeks that would overflow, you know, just impassable sometimes, and all muddy and all that.

03:43.238 --> 03:45.501
So two other boys and I,

03:46.156 --> 03:55.565
rented a room in Caldwell and we paid eight dollars a month for that big room in which we did all of our, whatever we did, that was it.

03:56.769 --> 03:59.136
I would come home and

03:59.538 --> 04:08.351
We would come home each weekend if we could, and by the way, I was in a high school band and things like that old high school, old Caldwell, and enjoyed, just had a tremendous time at high school.

04:08.371 --> 04:18.786
Anyway, our folks were all farmers and had big gardens and, you know, put up sausage and all that sort of stuff year round, hams and whatnot.

04:19.588 --> 04:23.233
So we took all of our food from home and we did our own cooking.

04:23.213 --> 04:30.023
And, you know, just was, you know, the three of us really worked as a team there at that.

04:30.043 --> 04:36.954
And so each weekend we would try to come home to get a fresh supply of food to take.

04:38.135 --> 04:42.902
And sometimes during the rainy season that would be impossible.

04:43.884 --> 04:49.272
So I can recall several times, like say on a Friday,

04:49.252 --> 05:06.418
Maybe we'd have, let's say, we could buy a big old, well really a better than a quart of milk for a nickel, and we made rice and just made, you know, stirred up the milk and rice and that was our new meal.

05:07.420 --> 05:15.512
Also, since we grew all these things, sometimes on Fridays when we had no, you know, good food left, because after all we had no refrigeration,

05:16.150 --> 05:21.216
I remember that we used to fry, we all grew big sweet potatoes in those days.

05:22.137 --> 05:29.066
We'd fry up a bunch of sweet potatoes and they would just glisten with all the grease on it and all that.

05:29.687 --> 05:30.548
Pour a little sugar on that.

05:30.568 --> 05:33.331
That was a grand, grand noon meal on Fridays.

05:34.293 --> 05:38.698
So that's sort of the high school thing and I graduated in 1935.

05:39.674 --> 05:45.482
And I was 16 at the time and had really no idea what I wanted to do in life.

05:45.662 --> 05:47.325
I just didn't know.

05:47.365 --> 05:49.508
I was just young and older.

05:49.908 --> 05:58.681
I didn't have access to all the old things like people have today, like have people to tell me, you know, talk to and so forth.

05:58.701 --> 06:02.526
My folks knew little about the outside world per se.

06:04.092 --> 06:08.317
I didn't know what to do, so I went home and stayed at home with my parents.

06:08.718 --> 06:17.749
I was the youngest of five and felt I was doing real well there, helping my mother and dad on the little farm there, and stayed at home that one year.

06:17.809 --> 06:24.937
And while I was there, I somehow or another decided that I should do something else.

06:25.037 --> 06:26.139
Obviously, time to move out.

06:26.399 --> 06:31.365
By now, after all, I was the ripe old age of 17 and ready to go.

06:31.885 --> 06:44.460
I found out that the A&M Dining Hall at that time, Spisa Hall, there was a guy by the name of Hotard, was the main guy, director of the dining halls in those days.

06:44.940 --> 06:59.277
Anyway, a number of the Snook boys had gotten jobs at Spisa Hall, and that's what he was named in those days even, as cooks or whatever it was, bakers or whatever they were.

06:59.780 --> 07:08.011
So I applied for a job there, and sure enough, and I'd say I was very fortunate because there were lots of guys after these jobs that time.

07:09.173 --> 07:20.348
And I thought I had it made when I got there, and by the way, this had nothing to do with being a student at all, just strictly a full-time employee.

07:21.370 --> 07:29.601
So when he got time to interview me, I thought it was rather strange because off right of hand, he called my name Skribani, which is rather rare for people to do that.

07:30.560 --> 07:35.566
And so in the process of being interviewed, he said, do you know Tommy Scrivati?

07:35.586 --> 07:36.767
I said, oh yes, he's my cousin.

07:37.508 --> 07:40.972
So he kind of says, well, we were old roommates here at A&M.

07:41.413 --> 07:43.956
So sure enough, I got a job.

07:44.677 --> 07:47.780
And that job paid $45 a month.

07:48.481 --> 07:52.686
And it included room and board and laundry.

07:52.666 --> 08:01.562
And in those days, there were some kind of gray shacks that were about where the water tower is now, somewhere about there, you know, the big one there.

08:02.285 --> 08:05.470
And we lived in those, and like I said, I got $45 a month.

08:06.512 --> 08:11.501
And work hours were normally, and I was assigned to the so-called vegetable line.

08:11.581 --> 08:18.072
We did the vegetables only, and then there were separate cooks and bakers or whatever they had of these others.

08:19.193 --> 08:26.065
And typically, we got up about 4.30 probably in the morning.

08:26.045 --> 08:41.235
and went over right across the street to the dining hall and got to eat breakfast but then we started preparing the noon meal and so our job from that point on

08:41.620 --> 08:45.947
till about 1.30 maybe, we stayed there and it didn't work.

08:47.128 --> 08:50.874
And I have some interesting things that happened during that time.

08:50.914 --> 08:56.964
And by the way, all of the cadets that were on campus, they ate their whole meals there.

08:57.945 --> 09:09.062
And one that I pulled, I remember it really bothered me a great deal, was that we had big drums.

09:09.042 --> 09:13.548
in which they poured the excess, shall I say, lard or grease in those.

09:14.769 --> 09:21.818
And so one time we were going to have corn.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.043
And so we had big cans we opened.

09:25.063 --> 09:34.695
And I didn't realize it, but instead of getting the grease from the proper place, I got the grease from what was tallow at that time.

09:35.047 --> 09:44.700
And so you can imagine what happened when that first diff, when it first came out and the eggs were out there, the students old, they started eating that stuff.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.283
Man, I thought I was going to get fired over the spot.

09:47.704 --> 09:51.428
Nevertheless, Hothard kind of grinned and said, oh, that's all right.

09:52.750 --> 09:58.558
So I worked there for that nine months and of course didn't have a summer job.

09:58.618 --> 10:02.623
Now this is the fall, you started in the fall of 37?

10:03.194 --> 10:17.090
I finished in 1942 at four years, so 42, 41, 40, 39, so that must have been 38 I guess.

10:17.271 --> 10:17.511
38.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.113
Okay.

10:19.133 --> 10:26.181
And if there's some, yeah, I stayed home one year then I guess I tried, fall of 38.

10:27.258 --> 10:31.542
I saved my money in the meantime thinking I wanted to go to A&M.

10:31.562 --> 10:34.846
And in those days, we all were in ROTC.

10:35.647 --> 10:37.208
So a lot of the clothes were furnished.

10:38.009 --> 10:40.992
Wait, let's back up on that year.

10:41.212 --> 10:41.512
Okay.

10:42.774 --> 10:50.822
About how many were there like you who were simply Sabisa Hall employees, not students?

10:53.104 --> 10:55.847
I would say almost none, although

10:56.165 --> 10:57.547
They employed a bunch of students.

10:57.567 --> 10:58.348
For example, O.D.

10:58.388 --> 11:05.918
Butler worked in a butcher shop at that time, and of course you know he became a student.

11:05.938 --> 11:18.375
And others were the same, but at that time, as far as I know, among my group anyway, they were full-time non-students, full-time workers.

11:19.267 --> 11:21.510
And so I tried to save my money, whatever I could.

11:22.151 --> 11:25.255
Oh, by the way, another thing.

11:26.176 --> 11:32.524
We also worked six and a half, oh, I talked about the morning.

11:33.285 --> 11:37.651
After that was done, we were free until about four o'clock.

11:38.232 --> 11:40.535
Then we'd go back and stay there until about seven.

11:40.555 --> 11:41.716
So I don't know how many hours that is.

11:41.796 --> 11:42.738
We put in a full day.

11:43.438 --> 11:47.704
And not only that, we got just one afternoon a week off.

11:47.819 --> 11:49.040
Out of seven.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.121
Out of seven, that's right.

11:50.902 --> 11:52.464
For 45 bucks a month again.

11:52.524 --> 12:06.919
And anyway, so I saved my money and bought a lot of secondhand stuff at the old, well, one that Ed Garner later had, I forget the guy's name who had it, at the north gate there.

12:07.459 --> 12:09.421
You're meaning secondhand clothes or furniture?

12:09.441 --> 12:10.943
Yeah, well, just a little bit.

12:11.043 --> 12:11.864
No, no furniture.

12:12.104 --> 12:15.868
No, just clothes or books or whatever I thought I would need.

12:16.540 --> 12:19.705
Now, there had to be some encouragement back home.

12:19.966 --> 12:20.326
Oh, yes.

12:20.527 --> 12:26.196
What encouragement did your family give you to do that and to think about going to college?

12:28.560 --> 12:29.381
Let's put it this way.

12:32.086 --> 12:41.121
I really, and in reality, I'd have to say that my family, my mother and dad were the finest people in the world.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.463
They were just the finest.

12:42.730 --> 12:47.315
But they had no financial means of, you know, helping me or anyone.

12:47.335 --> 12:56.046
And they, you know, they just, whatever I wanted to do, that was what they wanted me to do.

12:56.066 --> 13:02.633
So in a way, surely, let's put it this way, I had all the love that anybody could possibly have.

13:03.694 --> 13:05.797
But, you know, I was just out on my own.

13:05.857 --> 13:08.961
So they didn't say, yeah, you go to college, you do this, you do this.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.944
Like, in effect, they said, you know, here you are.

13:12.582 --> 13:19.993
During that year before you were a student, what did you and your buddies do for relaxation when you had a little time off?

13:20.013 --> 13:39.180
Well, first place, going back to high school days, one of the reasons I went to Caldwell instead of Somerville O'Brien was the fact that I had been taking, well, I had been taking music lessons on a trombone, and we local boys formed a little dance orchestra.

13:40.342 --> 13:47.854
And we played mainly at that time in the Czech community we played oom-pa-pa type music, but graduated along so we could play other places.

13:47.915 --> 13:52.041
So that was my main thing I guess that I did.

13:52.102 --> 13:58.472
We played at dances, many different places, over some distance from home as a matter of fact.

13:58.492 --> 14:06.265
I remember playing at Taylor for example, in an old SBJST hall there, and I remember one thing about that too is that

14:06.532 --> 14:18.256
In those days, and I'm really reminiscing about this other thing now, at the dances that we played, we played on a commissioned basis.

14:18.276 --> 14:22.365
Whatever the take was, we got half of it, the orchestra did.

14:23.267 --> 14:27.696
And if we had a bum night, we just sometimes didn't get anything.

14:28.267 --> 14:33.380
One night at Taylor, I remember we got $12 a piece.

14:34.263 --> 14:35.967
And that was really big money.

14:36.829 --> 14:40.639
And I remember also that I took that $12 and I bought

14:41.311 --> 14:47.819
what in those days was called an absolutely tailor-made suit for 12 bucks, and I was so proud of that suit.

14:47.839 --> 14:49.722
But anyway, so that was the main thing.

14:49.782 --> 14:56.811
We practiced, and oh, we did other things, but sometimes we would come.

14:57.872 --> 15:02.739
I had an older brother, by the way, who was teaching school, and he went to the University of Texas.

15:03.840 --> 15:09.968
I'm digressing a little bit now, but he was one of these guys that was, oh, kind of a...

15:11.956 --> 15:14.159
I was just saying, kind of a Bo Brummel type.

15:14.320 --> 15:18.006
He was always dressed to fit to kill, all that sort of stuff.

15:18.026 --> 15:20.409
And he went to the University of Texas and he taught school.

15:21.131 --> 15:28.883
He'd teach school maybe a year and then drop out and work somewhere and do other things.

15:28.923 --> 15:30.285
Then he'd go back anyway.

15:30.805 --> 15:37.214
So when he found out I was going to go to A&M, I remember his remark very well.

15:37.434 --> 15:43.703
He says, oh, Robert, you're going to go to that school or you're going to learn there.

15:43.723 --> 15:45.726
You're going to learn how to march and farm.

15:45.746 --> 15:46.227
Nothing else.

15:46.267 --> 15:47.028
That's it.

15:48.831 --> 15:58.264
So I had encouragement, but nevertheless, I'd have to be honest and say that it was in a way maybe a lack of something else to do.

15:58.328 --> 16:21.703
do right so let's give me one other thing a lot of my friends went to houston at that time and they delivered milk for phoenix dairy and those were days of the horse drawn carts and and a local snook boy had who had worked at phoenix was a route manager and he would hire any check boy from snook you know just loved to have us because they were good workers

16:21.683 --> 16:35.606
And I remember going to a state one night with a friend of mine there, and we got up early and he took me on his route, a little horse-drawn cart and delivered milk.

16:36.768 --> 16:41.917
And I was told, you know, I had a job there, but I just didn't know what I wanted to do.

16:41.977 --> 16:44.822
I was, I don't know, so I just thought up in there, yes.

16:44.802 --> 16:52.867
During that year then that you worked full-time in the dining hall, you continued to play in this Czech orchestra?

16:52.887 --> 16:53.590
Yes, that's right.

16:54.131 --> 16:58.525
And most of your concerts were, your performances were on weekends?

16:59.163 --> 17:02.327
Yes, Saturdays, almost.

17:02.668 --> 17:08.615
Because in those days, because of the nature of the roads, about Saturday nights were about the only time there was anything.

17:08.655 --> 17:10.378
We'd played Curtain.

17:10.398 --> 17:17.367
At that time, we were at Southside, they had a dance hall.

17:17.387 --> 17:18.188
Milliken-Welburn?

17:18.488 --> 17:23.635
No, about where Kroger's is now.

17:24.762 --> 17:27.406
What's the name of that little place there?

17:28.488 --> 17:30.531
Anyway, it doesn't have that name anyway.

17:30.551 --> 17:33.155
As a matter of fact, it's where the cemetery is now, just about now.

17:33.175 --> 17:35.319
You can say the cemetery.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.906
We used to play there in places like around here, Snoke.

17:41.028 --> 17:47.378
One other feature I want to add, and I might be taking too much time here, is that in those days,

17:47.797 --> 17:55.006
The cost of the dancing was 50 cents per male.

17:55.667 --> 17:56.328
Women were free.

17:57.669 --> 18:01.014
And so you can imagine we had to have a pretty good crowd to make any money.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.717
There were about seven of us playing and we really enjoyed that.

18:04.358 --> 18:08.423
Now would you all go in one vehicle or did it take two cars?

18:08.503 --> 18:10.125
Most of the time it took two cars.

18:11.084 --> 18:26.545
and you were the trombone player yes and i'm bragging now also was the vocalist and in those days we had no uh

18:27.706 --> 18:28.267
Microphones.

18:28.347 --> 18:29.548
Microphones, things like that.

18:30.169 --> 18:37.398
So I remember that today I tell my kids, believe it or not, of course they don't know who this guy was, but I felt like I was Rudy Valli.

18:37.619 --> 18:39.982
Of course I had one of those microphones.

18:40.182 --> 18:40.843
Yeah, megaphone.

18:40.983 --> 18:42.365
Megaphones.

18:42.865 --> 18:46.530
Those were grand days as the girls floated by and smiled at me.

18:47.151 --> 18:50.915
What were some of the most popular songs that you remember you all played?

18:51.036 --> 18:51.536
Oh, man.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.401
First of all,

18:55.381 --> 19:00.770
When we first started out we played strictly umpah-pah type music.

19:01.150 --> 19:03.655
And so in other words check polkas and waltzes and so forth.

19:03.695 --> 19:11.888
But, and by the way I think we called ourselves something I'm not sure, something like maybe the Snoop Polka Boys or something like that.

19:12.627 --> 19:17.995
Someone got the wise idea we needed to be better than that as we got a little better and better known.

19:18.796 --> 19:22.021
And so we ended up with a name called the Lone Star Ambassadors.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.225
I don't know where that came from but anyway.

19:24.906 --> 19:36.103
And so some of the, we played for example Up the Lazy River, you know that one, Moonglow, and

19:37.484 --> 19:45.755
At the moment, it escapes me, but those were the popular slower dances and so forth that we played.

19:47.056 --> 19:53.945
And we even tried to at one time kind of have like a theme song like the big dance bands did in those days.

19:54.686 --> 19:59.492
It was a song that went about Goodnight Sweetheart and so forth.

19:59.472 --> 20:05.178
But that didn't go over because every time we played that, the crowd expect us to play Home Sweet Home.

20:05.198 --> 20:06.420
So they didn't hear Home Sweet Home.

20:07.421 --> 20:10.364
We had a great time.

20:10.384 --> 20:12.446
So that's basically what I did at that time.

20:13.107 --> 20:23.438
And then I think that summer when I finished at the dining hall working there, the AAA farm program was in.

20:24.160 --> 20:28.445
And the local guy hired me to be his chain guy.

20:28.485 --> 20:33.171
You know, in those days they measured the acreage of cotton and so forth.

20:33.191 --> 20:42.522
And so I was the guy that ran the chain to plot out the, you know, and so I made little money there.

20:43.223 --> 20:45.505
And that was down in the Brasses Bottom?

20:45.605 --> 20:47.788
Well, no, that was every farm.

20:47.988 --> 20:50.812
No, but I mean, in general, where was the area?

20:51.032 --> 20:52.233
Around Snook.

20:52.454 --> 20:52.714
Okay.

20:52.834 --> 21:03.828
But then sometimes to finish up when somebody else wasn't through, we would go somewhere else, but not very far, maybe as far as lines or someplace like that, some of these other communities.

21:04.049 --> 21:05.771
So you then enrolled?

21:06.492 --> 21:12.139
So then I really don't remember the details, but I enrolled at Texas A&M then.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.350
What did I say, 1938?

21:14.871 --> 21:15.833
I believe that's right.

21:15.853 --> 21:16.093
Okay.

21:17.295 --> 21:17.937
Oh, 39.

21:19.179 --> 21:19.880
Yeah, 38.

21:20.341 --> 21:21.283
Okay, so I enrolled there.

21:22.004 --> 21:29.377
And I remember at that time, at least best I can recall, the tuition was $50 a semester.

21:29.778 --> 21:30.499
That was it.

21:31.306 --> 21:33.329
And I had secondhand books and so forth.

21:34.551 --> 21:46.348
And my first, and again, as I recall, and this may not be correct, but I really think I had only about $50 left after I had paid my fees.

21:47.790 --> 21:55.220
And so I found out somehow that they had the project house system.

21:56.302 --> 21:58.545
And there was an old house, a two-story house,

21:59.335 --> 22:02.162
on what is now around F&B Road, I think.

22:03.244 --> 22:06.993
And it was referred to as the haunted house.

22:07.254 --> 22:11.644
And so I got in there, and it was a project house.

22:12.587 --> 22:16.095
And as best I recall, we paid $12 a month for room and board.

22:17.341 --> 22:27.115
And then they had a truck that we caught to go back and forth to the main town, of course.

22:27.135 --> 22:33.765
And by that time, there was nothing, no buildings on the west side of the tracks at all.

22:34.326 --> 22:35.247
Nothing like that.

22:35.267 --> 22:36.689
How many lived in that house?

22:36.709 --> 22:37.130
Do you remember?

22:37.270 --> 22:38.311
I really don't know.

22:38.331 --> 22:40.234
Probably about 15 or 20, something like that.

22:40.254 --> 22:44.600
Were they from any particular place or scattered?

22:45.061 --> 22:46.403
I think they must have been scattered.

22:46.906 --> 22:56.802
But I didn't stay there very long because after I was at, as a freshman, I was there probably about six weeks, and my money was pretty well shot.

22:58.484 --> 23:04.294
And I was thinking about withdrawing and just said, well, I'll just take one of these jobs as a milkman or something like that.

23:05.095 --> 23:10.163
And I happened to run into an old boy who was a, about a junior at the time from Snook.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.011
And told him I was going to quit.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.313
Just couldn't go anymore.

23:14.954 --> 23:18.296
And had no further means of income, money.

23:19.077 --> 23:22.340
And so he sort of said, well, I said, don't do that.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.983
You know, you're going to end up like the rest of the guys down there.

23:27.284 --> 23:28.205
Why don't you do that?

23:28.665 --> 23:31.127
So he suggested I put an ad in the old Brian Eagle.

23:32.949 --> 23:33.469
And I did.

23:33.529 --> 23:40.015
And it stated something like, farm boy willing to do anything in exchange for room and board.

23:41.193 --> 23:59.783
And I put that ad in, and the very same day a guy called me from Bryan and said, look, I have anywhere between 12 and 20 cows to be milked, morning and night.

24:00.784 --> 24:06.373
And then when you can, you'll help us deliver the milk by nothing pasteurized, nothing.

24:06.556 --> 24:18.097
And these were friends in their church, which is at that time the College Avenue Baptist Church, which is located almost across the street from where the main courthouse is in Bryan now.

24:19.319 --> 24:27.754
And so I did that, and I did that morning and night.

24:29.101 --> 24:33.247
walked to where the courthouse is now, roughly somewhere right there.

24:33.267 --> 24:35.831
And in those days, none of us had automobiles, of course.

24:36.452 --> 24:38.355
And we'd thumb a ride to the campus.

24:39.336 --> 24:47.908
And then after the school day was over, I would go back and she'd, his wife would prepare a little sandwich for me or something like that.

24:48.630 --> 24:55.159
And we would congregate in the, at that time, where the YMCA building is now.

24:55.662 --> 25:02.915
There was a bowling alley there, and we would congregate down there during Lunardi, Edom Hill, that sort of thing.

25:04.057 --> 25:12.131
And that's where they also, there was a kind of, well, they served ice cream and stuff like that.

25:12.191 --> 25:13.333
I forget who had that now.

25:13.814 --> 25:14.536
It was very popular.

25:14.716 --> 25:19.324
Now, where was this little dairy located?

25:19.591 --> 25:26.141
Well, it wasn't really a dairy, it was just, it was personally owned, and so he had just his own, okay.

25:26.161 --> 25:40.182
It was located out on what was called Knoll Lane, and that is on the east side of town, and I've driven by there several times to try to locate where that exactly was.

25:40.786 --> 25:47.613
And I know kind of where it is, but I can't give you the, you know, all that has been developed and all that's been lost.

25:47.633 --> 25:51.397
How did you get from there to the courthouse area to Thummara?

25:51.417 --> 25:52.398
Walk, walk.

25:52.418 --> 25:53.600
You walked, okay.

25:55.241 --> 25:59.025
And now you're a freshman with this kind of task.

26:00.066 --> 26:00.147
Yes.

26:00.167 --> 26:04.912
And at that point, did you have any idea what you were going to major in?

26:05.112 --> 26:05.292
No.

26:06.098 --> 26:12.526
And let me say furthermore, going back again, there was an old ag that had graduated from A&M.

26:13.828 --> 26:18.353
When we talked about me going to A&M, he gave me two pieces of advice.

26:19.455 --> 26:25.543
Number one, in those days, you had to be in one of the military units, or whatever you call it.

26:26.544 --> 26:28.506
He says, you want to be in the Coast Artillery.

26:28.727 --> 26:29.367
That's one thing.

26:30.048 --> 26:33.793
Number two, you want to major in ag because you want to be an ag teacher.

26:34.364 --> 26:36.627
Neither one of these proved correct.

26:36.767 --> 26:45.878
And the Coast Artillery, I was out of phase just real quick because in that field, they took basically engineering students.

26:46.840 --> 26:50.004
And so, and they had to have math and trig and all that sort of stuff.

26:50.024 --> 26:52.527
So I was sort of out of my element right away.

26:52.547 --> 26:59.455
And then the other was also, I started out and didn't know what I started out in that field.

27:00.396 --> 27:03.240
And the freshman year, I took a course.

27:03.878 --> 27:05.120
called Fish and Game.

27:05.941 --> 27:07.684
There was a professor by the name of W.B.

27:07.884 --> 27:09.667
Davis that taught that course.

27:09.687 --> 27:11.169
And he was just phenomenal.

27:11.250 --> 27:12.692
He just did a tremendous job.

27:12.712 --> 27:14.054
You might have heard of him.

27:15.657 --> 27:18.842
And I just thought, boy, this is what I want to do.

27:19.523 --> 27:20.464
So I changed to that.

27:22.207 --> 27:24.891
And then stayed in that year.

27:25.715 --> 27:31.861
But let me go a little bit further now, and I changed majors again, of course.

27:35.225 --> 27:39.409
After the Fish and Game major, changed then to Sociology and how that came out.

27:39.449 --> 27:47.017
Anyway, I went back and forth, you know, to class.

27:47.037 --> 27:50.660
And let me mention one other thing that I think is kind of interesting.

27:51.581 --> 27:55.165
My very first class that I had at A&M was in the chemistry building.

27:56.140 --> 27:59.663
And in those days, if we had labs, we could wear coveralls.

27:59.683 --> 28:04.708
And they were really coveralls and had the A&M logo on the back, A&M College of Texas.

28:05.529 --> 28:07.711
And I was so proud I had my coveralls on.

28:07.751 --> 28:11.535
And first class, I went to that classroom and sit down.

28:12.135 --> 28:16.259
And it was a real nice room, apparently redone or whatever.

28:16.279 --> 28:18.081
And I had a clipboard.

28:19.162 --> 28:25.388
And I sat on the very front row because I wanted to make sure I was being noticed or whatever.

28:25.469 --> 28:28.832
And there was a guy by the name of Eads, E-A-D-S, he was a professor.

28:30.194 --> 28:35.219
And the very first thing he jumped right on me, right off the bat, and he just, he really let me have it.

28:35.639 --> 28:36.940
He said, what are you doing with that clipboard?

28:37.421 --> 28:40.764
Are you going to scratch the surface of that, you know, and all that?

28:41.304 --> 28:46.830
And it just made me feel so small I just, you know, almost said, gee, I'll get out here and go home or something.

28:48.031 --> 28:49.993
Anyway that was my first experience in the classroom.

28:50.614 --> 28:51.755
Okay.

28:51.775 --> 28:55.138
So I would thumb a ride back and forth.

28:55.861 --> 28:57.283
starting at the court house.

28:57.304 --> 28:59.427
In those days that was no problem, no problem.

29:00.008 --> 29:03.895
Anybody that had room, no problem.

29:03.915 --> 29:10.887
So I stayed there that freshman year and completed that freshman year that way.

29:12.209 --> 29:15.996
And then that summer I went home and

29:17.461 --> 29:22.847
They took me into the office in Caldwell, the AAA office, in which I ran what was called a plonometer.

29:22.867 --> 29:29.453
It was kind of a little bitty instrument where they drew the lines on the farms as they were shown.

29:29.894 --> 29:33.758
You would run that to show how many acres that they had and all that sort of stuff.

29:33.778 --> 29:34.499
So I stayed there.

29:35.400 --> 29:47.232
And by the way, I stayed in an old little shack in the backyard of one of the houses and did my own cooking and all that sort of stuff again.

29:48.410 --> 29:58.163
And then comes the second, then comes the sophomore year, I decided I'd had enough of milk and cows and all that, if best I could.

29:58.944 --> 30:11.320
So I rented a room, almost downtown Brine, from people who had lived, well, a young, the lady had been grown up in Snoke and knew my folks.

30:12.021 --> 30:14.704
And so I rented a room from them, had kitchen privileges.

30:15.494 --> 30:18.700
did my own cooking and brought my food home and all that sort of stuff.

30:19.742 --> 30:32.986
Stayed there about a semester and in the meantime an opening occurred on the campus in the project houses that used to be on the south side of those white ones over there.

30:33.588 --> 30:37.114
So I got in one of those and I lived there in the Leon County Project House.

30:38.326 --> 30:48.096
And at that time, I remember specifically, again, we definitely paid $12 a month for room and board, and I think there were 36 of us in that one house.

30:49.717 --> 30:56.124
And four of us to the room, and the room was very small, but that's beside the point.

30:56.144 --> 31:01.689
And so that's how, but anyway, also worked for the N.Y.A.

31:01.909 --> 31:02.550
in those days.

31:02.830 --> 31:05.633
They paid us 30 cents an hour to do whatever we were assigned to do.

31:06.457 --> 31:10.204
And I worked in the landscape department.

31:10.224 --> 31:14.892
What we did in those days, there were no motorized lawnmowers or anything like that.

31:14.912 --> 31:20.262
So we mowed grass, whatever needed done, you know, chopped or grass or whatever needed.

31:21.224 --> 31:27.435
And by the way, I helped plant some of those trees that are lying the main.
