WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:02.259
Okay. So the fighting was over. Well, the fighting 
was substantially over. The German army had

00:07.506 --> 00:11.451
effectively collapsed by that time. Essentially 
mop up operations going from where we were on the

00:13.334 --> 00:30.898
west bank of the Rhine right on clear up into 
Yugoslavia and then the unit got sent back to the

00:13.334 --> 00:30.898
United States and actually got sent to Camp Swift, 
Texas, a backdrop.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.167
So that was a shortcoming, just messing around, no 
excuse for getting wounded in the way I did. It

00:41.448 --> 00:43.670
would have been nice to finish out the war. Yes, I 
guess it would.

00:48.715 --> 00:53.440
In retrospect, I don't know whether that would 
have been unlucky or lucky as it was.

00:56.463 --> 01:00.767
There's so many people qualified

01:10.906 --> 01:24.764
and of course you never know

01:10.906 --> 01:24.764
what one day difference at one time or another 
would have made. It's just that close.

01:28.690 --> 01:32.174
Retirement is a major change in an individual's 
life. Did you retire because of the age? I went on

01:35.979 --> 01:39.664
mandatory retirement for time and grade. One is 
allowed five years in grade or a certain number of

01:40.302 --> 01:51.296
years for

01:40.302 --> 01:51.296
that grade. But my mandatory retirement was 
effective because I was five years in the great

01:51.316 --> 01:58.886
Brigadier General.

02:01.148 --> 02:07.997
At the time, I was one of those being considered for 
a major general assignment commander of the 75th

02:08.534 --> 02:12.239
Maneuver Area Command in Houston.

02:14.742 --> 02:19.367
And I guess there was some disappointment that I 
wasn't selected for that. But actually I had mixed

02:21.710 --> 02:30.601
emotions about it because I had real heavy demands 
on my civilian job too. Very few general officers

02:32.023 --> 02:35.267
live five minutes from their headquarters. in the 
Army Reserve, so I could accomplish this work with

02:35.821 --> 02:41.510
a very minimum of time. And one time previously, 
I'd turned down an opportunity to be assigned to a

02:43.793 --> 02:59.798
general officer position as deputy commander of 
the 90th Division Artillery, because I didn't

02:43.793 --> 02:59.798
feel like I had the time to do it. There again, it was 
just a lucky decision. because the one who was

03:03.631 --> 03:19.515
assigned to that position got promoted to 
Brigadier General, but then his job was, when the

03:03.631 --> 03:19.515
whole division was deactivated, he didn't have a 
job, so he didn't serve in the job for about one

03:03.631 --> 03:19.515
year. So if I'd taken that assignment, I would have 
had to go to Dallas, Texas to meet with the unit.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.149
That would have taken a good deal more time. 
Probably would have detracted from my

03:30.496 --> 03:34.464
effectiveness in my civilian job. I wouldn't have 
had the position. I probably would have earned a

03:39.013 --> 03:42.781
star alright, but I wouldn't have had the position 
very long. I was just lucky that I didn't take that.

03:46.669 --> 03:49.394
So the job down in Houston was a major generalship? 
Yes. And what would you have been doing now?

03:53.041 --> 04:01.378
command the 75th maneuver area command, which is 
really only about 350 people down there. So it's

04:01.398 --> 04:05.145
basically a smaller command than much ahead, but a 
higher rank. Much smaller command, much higher

04:05.225 --> 04:10.736
rank, but the responsibilities of the unit are 
great. It's just a big headquarters unit that is

04:15.113 --> 04:27.129
prepared to command a maneuver area on 
mobilization and carried out similar

04:15.113 --> 04:27.129
responsibilities on an active duty and active 
duty for training basis. Do you remember what your

04:28.431 --> 04:31.054
thoughts were on the day that you retired? Oh, I was 
happy with my career. Had no regrets at all. Plenty

04:39.314 --> 04:41.717
of things to do on weekends. Proud of the people, 
proud of the status of the unit the way I left it.

04:49.128 --> 04:53.273
Very proud of the man that had been selected to 
succeed me. I had campaigned for him. That's

04:56.117 --> 04:58.040
Colonel McIntosh.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.868
I'd selected and tried to bring him along, put him 
in position. For every general officer position,

05:04.068 --> 05:08.694
of course, any eligible colonel can apply for it. 
So here was my deputy right there that we had really

05:08.714 --> 05:22.532
a game plan for succession to command of that unit 
over about five years in the future. That got

05:24.175 --> 05:28.320
telescoped quite a bit because Carl McIntosh 
succeeded me and within a year he was Deputy Chief

05:28.587 --> 05:40.844
Army Reserves in Washington, a position I feel 
like I might have had a little bit of influence in

05:28.587 --> 05:40.844
helping him get. And then the man we had picked to 
succeed McIntosh got to succeed him in just a

05:41.966 --> 05:54.544
little over a year, and that was Colonel Len 
Stewart, a man I had helped to develop

05:57.494 --> 06:02.401
a highly talented person, real able. I was proud to 
be present at the ceremony where he got his star.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.432
That would be gratifying. Oh, the whole thing was 
just a pleasant trip to me and I really had no

06:11.033 --> 06:18.343
regrets on retirement. Well, let's talk about 
leadership then. It's about our final topic.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.033
Could you define leadership?

06:29.793 --> 06:59.395
Well, leadership is a status

06:29.793 --> 06:59.395
which one achieves

06:29.793 --> 06:59.395
by

06:29.793 --> 06:59.395
selection

06:29.793 --> 06:59.395
and earns

06:29.793 --> 06:59.395
by of course having followers. fundamental that 
if one is a leader, you must have followers.

07:07.812 --> 07:28.622
Though it is a status that may be earned by 
designation or selection by higher leaders or

07:07.812 --> 07:28.622
higher authorities, or it can be just given to a 
person on a volunteer basis by a group of people.

07:30.307 --> 07:33.631
Now, you've been a leader in both civilian and in 
the military. Is there a difference?

07:39.319 --> 07:40.821
Basically, I don't think there is. I think the same 
traits for success exist in both places. You know,

07:48.071 --> 07:58.144
it's popularized quite often in films to see 
military leaders like Patton, you know, sort of,

07:48.071 --> 07:58.144
come on, over the hill boys, let's go and kick them 
in the back of the pants. That kind of, That idea, do

07:59.973 --> 08:07.701
you think that that type of leader is very typical 
of the armed forces? Not as much anymore. It is a

08:12.487 --> 08:19.274
very effective form of leadership, very 
authoritarian, dominant kind of leadership. But

08:19.394 --> 08:29.625
the

08:19.394 --> 08:29.625
followers don't, in general, react to that, I 
believe, readily as they once did. We have a higher

08:33.534 --> 08:48.096
educated group of people that are

08:33.534 --> 08:48.096
rather sophisticated and knowledgeable and 
different psychology, different expectations.

08:48.116 --> 08:57.030
I don't believe that you can, they're not blind 
followers that one might expect to respond best to

08:58.816 --> 09:02.322
that style of leadership.

09:06.568 --> 09:11.736
Most people that tried, the way I'm saying it, 
would fail in that kind of leadership. Patton was

09:13.219 --> 09:19.549
notably successful.

09:19.569 --> 09:26.680
I would say that Paul Bryant, as a football coach, 
is that type of man. why it is that they're able to be

09:28.769 --> 09:35.721
so effective with that style of leadership. 
Certainly it isn't my style. What is your style of

09:38.686 --> 09:40.108
leadership?

09:44.655 --> 09:53.410
I've explained it to

09:44.655 --> 09:53.410
my faculty and to my leaders in the Army this way. 
have often said that one time I read an article in a

09:55.567 --> 10:09.326
wildlife magazine, where the leading sentence in 
the article was, you can drive a buffalo anywhere

09:55.567 --> 10:09.326
he wants to go. And I believe that's what you can do 
with professional people and good subordinate

10:11.910 --> 10:18.579
leaders in an army. You can help them achieve 
whatever it is they really want to achieve.

10:25.520 --> 10:37.976
My style of leadership is to try to give them enough 
recognition, encouragement, responsibility so

10:25.520 --> 10:37.976
that they will want to achieve and try to help them 
do that.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.061
Support of them. Well certainly, create 
opportunity and really, I've often told the

10:44.584 --> 10:53.856
successful people that I never expected them to do 
anything except a little bit more than they were

10:55.642 --> 11:01.970
doing right now. So I always wanted them to be 
ambitious and want to achieve just a little bit

11:02.751 --> 11:11.561
more. Give them recognition for it. Be frank with 
them about my perception of what their status was,

11:16.167 --> 11:23.235
I think. We must be frank and honest and open about 
those things. Okay. So, so far you've mentioned

11:31.635 --> 11:38.664
honesty, being frank, being encouraging. These 
to me seem to be values you think leaders should

11:38.724 --> 11:42.329
have. Are there other values that leaders should 
have? Well, I certainly believe that a leader must

11:46.374 --> 11:50.640
set the example. I don't believe he can demand 
anything of those for whom he has responsibility

11:50.907 --> 11:57.415
that he wouldn't do himself. That

11:57.796 --> 12:07.688
he has to be willing to work just a little bit harder 
than those under him to achieve. So I don't believe

12:08.649 --> 12:16.459
he can demand anything of the people for whom he has 
responsibility that he wouldn't do himself. I

12:17.958 --> 12:21.823
don't believe you can get anybody to do as I say, not 
as I do. So

12:21.843 --> 12:29.853
that's one other attribute that I think is very 
important. I think it is very important that the

12:31.775 --> 12:38.243
people receive adequate recognition for what 
they do. That they believe that what they do is

12:39.405 --> 12:44.011
important. I wanted to them to take pride in it. I 
want to have pride and I want them to be proud. Self

12:53.750 --> 12:54.731
satisfying. Achievement. It seems to me that 
you're the type of leader that opens paths for

12:59.237 --> 13:08.570
people so they can use their open ways for people so 
they can use their own potentials. Would you agree

13:10.012 --> 13:10.993
with that? I don't want to put words in your mouth. I 
try to

13:18.438 --> 13:28.527
The greatest responsibility a leader has, for 
instance, one who is department head or whatever,

13:18.438 --> 13:28.527
is the selection of the people that will be on his 
team. And we have a lot of opportunity for that. A

13:33.051 --> 13:43.080
person to have success must be a good judge of the 
characteristics of the people that he can choose.

13:43.140 --> 13:46.403
They must have a lot of potential. He must get a lot 
of satisfaction out of seeing them develop their

13:47.007 --> 14:02.946
potential and keep providing opportunity and 
stimulus to them.

14:02.966 --> 14:06.670
Is tolerance or flexibility, are those important 
for a leader? Well, for some leaders, tolerance is

14:09.353 --> 14:16.221
important, but tolerance can also be a fault. I'm 
sure George Patton was mighty intolerant. He had

14:21.402 --> 14:27.767
very high standards and he certainly expected 
people to come up with those standards or else.

14:30.690 --> 14:34.554
So I think that a leader can be too tolerant. 
However, I don't think he can be entirely

14:36.175 --> 14:39.178
inflexible. He can't be a martinet.

14:45.543 --> 14:47.305
I certainly believe one hundred percent you 
stimulate people to greater accomplishments by

14:48.668 --> 14:55.359
encouragement, not punishment. But you cannot 
achieve anything at all in the way of improved

14:56.100 --> 15:04.994
performance by any form of punishment.

15:09.421 --> 15:15.250
And I believe that a person, that a leader can help a 
person to develop by observing and encouraging

15:16.951 --> 15:26.585
him in what he does best.

15:30.931 --> 15:36.199
Everybody likes to excel in something and gain 
recognition for it. At all times I've tried to fit

15:38.522 --> 15:44.190
square pegs into square holes. where we could all 
be real pleased with what was accomplished. Now

15:50.434 --> 16:02.005
let's say that the Corps asked you to come over and 
give a talk to these eighteen, nineteen year old

15:50.434 --> 16:02.005
young men on how to become a leader. What would you 
say? Well, I had a talk like that prepared one time.

16:11.835 --> 16:13.857
Oh you did? staff or somebody that was scheduled to 
give the commission an exercise was held up by

16:14.815 --> 16:21.784
weather some place. I don't know where it is now. Do 
you remember what you said? No, well I didn't ever

16:26.911 --> 16:35.243
have to make it because the weather cleared up and 
the man did get here, but I was on alert to give the

16:26.911 --> 16:35.243
commission an exercise.

16:37.826 --> 16:43.033
Well, I would say that

16:46.152 --> 17:13.965
certain attributes that they must have to achieve 
leadership roles would be to be dedicated, to set

16:46.152 --> 17:13.965
the example themselves for the followers,

16:46.152 --> 17:13.965
to demand high standards, and to

16:46.152 --> 17:13.965
be generous with recognition for subordinates.

17:16.983 --> 17:20.387
that the leader must be somewhat self-effacing. 
If people believe they're being exploited for the

17:20.788 --> 17:28.618
benefit of the leader, that is certainly a turn 
off. I believe that the leader must be honest and

17:31.362 --> 17:37.810
forthright

17:31.362 --> 17:37.810
and genuine. If there is a ever any suspicion of 
hypocrisy. This is definitely a turn off for

17:46.990 --> 17:53.396
people.

17:53.416 --> 18:11.273
Then I think I believe I said earlier that the 
person must know his own goals and objectives and

17:53.416 --> 18:11.273
what it takes to achieve those goals based upon 
experience and observation of others.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.630
Those are some of the characteristics. The Army 
does have excellent courses on leadership. One of

18:24.578 --> 18:33.031
the best guys I know of to teach it is Dr. Lannis Hope 
right here in our Department of Educational

18:24.578 --> 18:33.031
Psychology. He and I organized a leadership 
school for our engineer brigade. We asked people

18:37.838 --> 18:44.989
to select one person out of each company in the 
brigade and we put on a leadership course. for

18:46.015 --> 18:52.123
years, so he's excellent on psychology and 
leadership.

18:54.606 --> 18:58.151
We did use psychological principles at the time. 
We were fascinated with Maslow's hierarchy of

18:58.251 --> 19:08.204
satisfaction, what gives satisfaction to 
people. I think that's been modified somewhat.

19:22.010 --> 19:31.225
I believe I could give them a lecture on leadership 
based on my experience.

19:31.465 --> 19:34.129
That might seem logical to them. Now, as a very last 
topic, there is a number of very important changes

19:35.572 --> 19:47.571
in the 1960s here on this campus, as you're well 
aware of and as you partook in, as a matter of fact.

19:47.631 --> 19:49.013
And as a former student, I'd like to ask you what you 
thought of them. Could you tell us about your role

19:53.924 --> 20:01.074
with the women and the blacks and General Rudder 
and to the Mandatory Corps? Could you tell us about

20:01.255 --> 20:03.778
your ideas on that and your role? Certainly.

20:07.464 --> 20:13.853
I was privileged to be appointed to a three-person 
committee by General Rudder. a committee that was

20:16.027 --> 20:29.862
chaired by Dr. Archie Flowers and the Veterinary 
Public Health Department to consider carefully

20:16.027 --> 20:29.862
the matter of enrollment of women in Texas A&M and 
of compulsory core.

20:32.866 --> 20:43.738
We did a rather thorough study of it and I'm very 
proud of the fact that the admission of women

20:32.866 --> 20:43.738
proceeded exactly according to the way we 
recommended that is first that the wives of

20:43.938 --> 21:04.284
students and daughters of faculty members be 
admitted and that females be admitted to those

20:43.938 --> 21:04.284
courses that were unique at Texas A&M in all of 
Texas such as in their medicine if they were

20:43.938 --> 21:04.284
otherwise qualified.

21:08.069 --> 21:13.135
We recommended against the mandatory core 
because that was military had declined in

21:13.351 --> 21:30.793
popularity and we saw that as a handicap to improve 
stature of Texas A&M University appeal to the

21:13.351 --> 21:30.793
general, highly qualified student.

21:38.102 --> 21:40.945
So of course Those things were also considered by 
the century study recommendations by a group of

21:41.397 --> 22:04.300
100 highly selected people around the state who 
served with General Rutter in determining

21:41.397 --> 22:04.300
what Texas A&M should be like in 1976.

22:06.946 --> 22:13.436
That was one of the finest activities shaping the 
future of Texas A&M I think that ever has occurred.

22:13.456 --> 22:24.974
As a matter of fact, most of the gold were exceeded

22:13.456 --> 22:24.974
prior to the, I don't know, somewhere between 10 
and 15 years. I don't remember seeing me like that.

22:26.396 --> 22:33.747
It was early 60's when the study was made.

22:36.157 --> 22:44.469
I have been very inspired by the popularity and 
progress of Texas A&M University since that time.

22:46.271 --> 22:52.620
Now as a corpsman, was it difficult for you to 
advise against mandatory corps? Not at all. Based

22:54.803 --> 23:05.758
upon appraisal of the situation, based upon the 
realization that the corps could be preserved on a

22:54.803 --> 23:05.758
voluntary basis, and be even more professional 
than it was during the time when it was compulsory.

23:13.927 --> 23:19.073
I had thought that we could go both directions with 
the increased enrollment. I believe that the

23:19.093 --> 23:27.323
Corps of Cadets right now is good or better than it 
ever has been in the history of Texas A&M. I'm

23:27.443 --> 23:30.867
certain that it's much better than it was in my 
time. So we can have both aspects. have a very fine

23:35.219 --> 23:52.107
Corps of Cadets in military uniform to maintain 
the traditions of Texas A&M, and we can have a very

23:35.219 --> 23:52.107
fine student body outside the Corps of Cadets. Why 
do you think the Corps is better? I've heard others

23:54.090 --> 23:59.539
say that the Corps is not as good as it was in the 
1930s. Why do you feel it's better? Well, I know

24:02.432 --> 24:07.098
that the people are better educated. They're 
better prepared. They're better led. They have a

24:10.663 --> 24:13.767
lot more resources. There is an opportunity for 
many more leaders. The organizations are

24:17.633 --> 24:19.495
smaller. They must have three or four times as many 
active army or active military officers here.

24:27.734 --> 24:34.881
They have much more variety in what they can 
select, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines.

24:39.926 --> 24:54.019
I believe that their standards of performance in 
things that you can see, such as their reviews, are

24:39.926 --> 24:54.019
better. Their appearance is better. Their 
uniforms are better. I just don't know any way

24:58.666 --> 25:02.772
where I think they are better than they were in my 
day. What about camaraderie?

25:08.661 --> 25:21.079
I'm not 100% prepared to say about that, but I 
believe it has to be fully as good, if not better,

25:08.661 --> 25:21.079
because there is no compulsion. People that don't 
like it can get out anytime they want to. So I'd have

25:24.985 --> 25:28.470
to say that the ones that stay in there must like it. 
They must be inspired by the camaraderie and

25:29.547 --> 25:34.201
association. Do I have to say that better than it 
was? Now I've been at other institutions that are

25:38.812 --> 25:54.276
trying to maintain their size, but not grow too 
fast, just sort of stay fairly steady at 15,000 or

25:38.812 --> 25:54.276
20,000 students. And Texas A&M goes from about 
6,000 to 7,000 students in 1970 to 31,000 in 1960.

26:05.255 --> 26:11.822
to 31,000 in 1980 had done increases perhaps five 
times.

26:14.184 --> 26:27.017
Why do we have such a growth orientation here at 
A&M, where at other schools they don't want to grow

26:14.184 --> 26:27.017
too fast, at many other schools?

26:29.739 --> 26:32.342
Well, Texas A&M and its role in school has been one 
of those institutions, one of really two

26:34.145 --> 26:49.170
institutions in the past that were selected for 
excellence. University of Texas and Texas A&M.

26:52.515 --> 26:55.600
University of Texas has long had a high 
enrollment. The funding of the university is

26:57.503 --> 27:00.388
based

27:05.195 --> 27:07.519
standard allocation of funds.

27:10.304 --> 27:28.755
So the more students we have, the more student 
credit hours we have, the more funds we qualify

27:10.304 --> 27:28.755
for, the greater our influence in a former 
student's organization in all aspects of the

27:10.304 --> 27:28.755
state.

27:33.781 --> 27:49.540
And I think that prior to the time that we became 
quite popular, that many, many of the farmer

27:33.781 --> 27:49.540
students were so dedicated to trying to recruit 
people to come to Texas A&M. We could hardly

27:50.261 --> 27:53.044
believe it when it did get popular. We got 
practically overwhelmed with students.

28:01.625 --> 28:25.607
I presume that these are reasons that Texas A&M has 
wanted to earn and be accorded the kind of

28:01.625 --> 28:25.607
recognition they have both for the depth and the 
size of their contributions and endeavors.

28:31.797 --> 28:37.285
not everybody is interested in the size of the 
university.

28:39.889 --> 28:51.746
There are many who would prefer to see it half as 
large as it is now,

28:39.889 --> 28:51.746
when life might have been a little less demanding 
on them.

28:55.091 --> 28:58.716
What's your opinion of another general, Earl 
Rudder?

29:01.615 --> 29:08.064
Well, I was privileged to serve with Errol Rudder, 
both in the military and in the civilian.

29:10.948 --> 29:25.228
Errol Rudder was one of those people, quite like 
Patton, that had a certain charisma, that had the

29:10.948 --> 29:25.228
characteristics that I have described of a 
leader. A time-tested man, battle-tested,

29:32.412 --> 29:55.942
Started out from a handicapped position when he 
was placed

29:32.412 --> 29:55.942
on active duty at captain level and required to 
perform against those that had much better

29:32.412 --> 29:55.942
training and experience to carry out the job. In 
spite of all these handicaps, he did excel. an

30:01.724 --> 30:19.862
honest-to-God legitimate war hero for his 
leadership of his Ranger Battalion at Pointe du

30:01.724 --> 30:19.862
Haut in France,

30:01.724 --> 30:19.862
a man who

30:01.724 --> 30:19.862
gave me a tremendous amount of encouragement. And 
I'd have to say that one of the fine emotional

30:19.982 --> 30:31.613
experiences I had is when Mrs. Earl Rudder 
presented me a set of his stars that I got to wear.

30:34.411 --> 30:39.259
So he's a man I respected greatly and loved. He gave 
me the sort of inspiration that I said I think

30:41.202 --> 30:50.577
should be given to subordinates. Recognition, 
demanding, fair,

30:50.597 --> 31:02.275
always wanted the person to be a little more 
ambitious. my experience with him. Like many

31:06.462 --> 31:17.457
other, practically every prominent man, I'm sure 
there were some who were detractors, all right,

31:06.462 --> 31:17.457
who might have blamed him. He judged harshly 
sometimes. If you fell out of favor with him, you'd

31:20.441 --> 31:27.570
had it, sort of.
