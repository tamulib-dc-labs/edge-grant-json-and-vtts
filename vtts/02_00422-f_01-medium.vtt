WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:06.717
I want to know when the lights come on in New York 
City immediately. Of course, here I'm sitting

00:07.859 --> 00:10.002
here in the Pentagon, you know. How are

00:10.242 --> 00:16.110
we going to find that out? Not that I got an idea. 
Governor's Island then was still an Army post. Now

00:22.559 --> 00:25.443
I think the Coast Guard got it. So I called them up on 
the phone. And a sergeant. answered the

00:29.258 --> 00:30.239
telephone. He was a duty sergeant, I guess, 
because obviously this is a night when all

00:30.300 --> 00:35.227
everything's black. I said, Sergeant, I have a 
problem. He said, yes, sir, what it is? I said, if I

00:37.931 --> 00:39.633
can help you. I said, I have to know immediately 
when the lights come on in New York City. Can you

00:47.304 --> 00:48.025
help me? He said, well, certainly. I said, what are 
you going to do? He said, I'm going to get a private

00:49.868 --> 00:52.371
and post him out there and watch. And just as soon as 
Lower Manhattan, those lights come on, I'm going

00:52.431 --> 00:55.436
to let you know. I said, thank you, Sergeant. 
Really appreciate that. So that solved that

00:59.056 --> 01:00.137
problem. Of course, that didn't bring the lights 
on. And I notified the Navy. Of course, when you

01:04.181 --> 01:11.287
notify the Navy or the Army and say, yes, they want 
to know who's going to pay for this, because they

01:04.181 --> 01:11.287
had to move some of the ships because of the 
dockside. Of course, some of the crews are gone. It

01:12.848 --> 01:15.731
takes time to get them underway. But they said, 
sure, that they would do that. Fortunately, all of

01:20.555 --> 01:24.879
our tactical airfields have auxiliary. So they 
had no problems on their own. runways as far as some

01:28.135 --> 01:56.168
thought for a while this might be a preliminary to 
some sort of an attack because it's so widespread

01:28.135 --> 01:56.168
and all the experts couldn't figure it out you know 
but that this is impossible so we have a grid system

01:28.135 --> 01:56.168
this goes out it's just rerouted any way you can 
have a massive blackout like this plus the fact is

01:28.135 --> 01:56.168
that why you have it it was two or three different 
places which i called it circuit breakers that

01:28.135 --> 01:56.168
would occur what would take them all out course you 
know the solution finally was a massive surge

01:57.329 --> 02:24.872
reverse surge they've just overloaded 
everything that went up now i really don't know why

01:57.329 --> 02:24.872
or how what caused that tremendous reverse surge 
that knocked out on but it took them weeks to

01:57.329 --> 02:24.872
finally decide at least to announce that did they 
did they use the navy that way yep navy moved up and

01:57.329 --> 02:24.872
uh they were able to start The auxiliary 
generator, of course, that was just a small thing.

02:29.508 --> 02:33.492
It didn't help the city very much. The Army 
assisted with a generator, enabled Cronkite to

02:34.813 --> 02:43.082
come on and report by candlelight. At least he had 
power for his broadcast.

02:49.289 --> 02:50.590
But it was calls coming from Many places. And 
they'd come in because this was getting to be late

02:52.489 --> 02:55.052
at night. What are you doing? Have the lights been 
turned on. What do you hear? And the lights and

03:01.018 --> 03:05.862
power didn't come on until the next day. I think it 
was in the afternoon. But people were in a frantic,

03:08.525 --> 03:12.289
you know, they were on elevators to stop, you know, 
blackout. And you had people there. And how you get

03:13.270 --> 03:16.493
them out, and they pounded. And the birth rate went 
up, you know, after that. A lot of people had

03:22.695 --> 03:24.317
nothing else to do. Now, another more hairy type of 
experience, these are what you have, and you have

03:25.679 --> 03:32.167
to stay right with it, of course. You have people 
that expect you to have more information than

03:32.187 --> 03:35.591
anybody. Sure. And that's your job to get it. But 
one night, we thought we had a quiet night. And in

03:44.122 --> 03:44.843
the... We have a conference room also. We've got a 
big display board up here that shows the dew line

03:46.727 --> 03:55.339
across the North. And only once we got alert, both 
from the Colorado Springs American Command that

03:55.359 --> 04:12.062
was showing up, there's an unidentified object 
coming towards the United States. and just be

04:12.852 --> 04:15.776
happy the heading is coming from the USSR. And now 
you're really under the gun. At what point do you

04:21.144 --> 04:24.728
push the panic button? And what you do is an SOP, of 
course you notify the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the

04:24.748 --> 04:33.421
President, because they say it's got to be made, 
what are we going to do about that? Are we going to

04:33.841 --> 04:35.463
shoot it down, or what is it? And they finally 
figured out that monitoring this thing and

04:37.546 --> 04:41.712
tracking it It was too fast to be an aircraft. It 
must be a missile. And now it's getting pretty

04:47.828 --> 04:53.596
close to the dew line up there. They've been 
monitoring it out in the distance. And so I was

04:56.339 --> 04:59.343
talking to Colorado Springs. I said, at what point 
do you think that I should alert the Joint Chiefs of

04:59.363 --> 05:05.612
Staff and the president? And he said, well, it's 
getting pretty close. Because the way we figured

05:09.096 --> 05:11.800
it, it's It's minutes, of course, it's still quite 
a few minutes from the United States, but you've

05:12.725 --> 05:19.933
got to react to a ship scrambling aircraft. Well, 
they did scramble aircraft. So did you notify the

05:22.276 --> 05:24.038
Joint Chiefs then? No, I hadn't done it yet, Steve. 
But NORAD scrambled the aircraft? Yeah. Without

05:29.884 --> 05:31.326
notifying the Joint Chiefs? Well, they can do that 
routinely. But they weren't going to attack it.

05:34.870 --> 05:36.852
This is just getting airborne into position. Of 
course, they'd have a hell of a time attacking a

05:36.872 --> 05:39.094
missile. Sure. So... Once again, I was lucky, 
because my decision to delay it was correct.

05:47.246 --> 05:54.594
Because then I got a hurried call back and said, 
hold everything, because we've just found out

05:47.246 --> 05:54.594
what our problem is. It was a computer that was 
miscalibrated properly or something. Anyway, it

05:59.479 --> 06:02.342
was misreading something that wasn't there, I 
said. But it was really coming just as if it was

06:02.522 --> 06:06.426
headed for the United States. So you get 
situations like that, and you finally Find out if

06:10.589 --> 06:12.771
it's OK. It's such a sense of relief. It's like 
somebody taking a great load off. Another

06:17.997 --> 06:24.043
situation, I'll just tell one more, and then I'll 
move along to something else.

06:25.264 --> 06:27.146
I had a call one night. And the reason why things 
happen at night, when it's nighttime, of course,

06:27.226 --> 06:36.756
in Washington, it's daytime in Vietnam and a lot of 
other places in the world. So it can be very active

06:36.776 --> 06:40.360
in the MCC at night. and slow going in the daytime. 
Plus the fact you got everybody to help you in the

06:43.106 --> 06:45.309
daytime. You know, the chairman of the joint, 
everybody's there. You don't have all that

06:49.394 --> 06:50.896
responsibility. You just let them call in. And 
although you handle everything, you don't ever

06:53.300 --> 07:00.770
call anybody unless it's really a need to. So I had 
that call. They said that Cuba has just captured

07:09.702 --> 07:15.427
one of our ships and that came out of I guess Key 
West.

07:17.669 --> 07:18.190
How do you know? Says because we were monitoring 
and we listened to it and we had the Cubans said I

07:18.230 --> 07:32.223
have captured and the name the name of the ship. So 
we immediately asked where is that ship? Oh yes

07:36.006 --> 07:37.988
this is a scientific I don't remember where it was 
from, MIT or some college or university, was

07:39.554 --> 07:51.471
assigned as a board doing some sort of underwater 
research. And on that type of ship, they only come

07:52.993 --> 08:03.148
on the air as intervals because they don't have 
anybody to sit in the communication room 24 hours a

07:52.993 --> 08:03.148
day. This is not a U.S. government ship, is it? 
Yeah. It was a U.S. government ship? Yeah. No, it

08:07.985 --> 08:08.766
was private. It was a private research ship. Yeah. 
Okay. Well, sometimes that's a cover for

08:12.511 --> 08:16.236
intelligence. In this case, this was a legitimate 
research. And so after hearing this, well, we've

08:20.241 --> 08:27.070
got to check it out, see. So they scrambled some 
planes down in Florida. And they flew over the ship

08:33.368 --> 08:39.654
and actually got dived down real close. But later 
on, we found out this kind of frightened the crew

08:39.674 --> 08:47.361
aboard that because they couldn't figure out what 
the hell is everybody coming around here getting

08:39.674 --> 08:47.361
so close to. It was off Cuba, near Cuba, but in 
international waters, like Cuban waters. And

08:53.487 --> 09:02.295
there was some Cuban ships at a distance, but not 
right alongside this particular one. Crap. So

09:05.065 --> 09:08.147
then the question comes, what are we going to do? 
Because it appears to be heading for the harbor.

09:11.870 --> 09:13.131
Are we going to intercept it?

09:16.174 --> 09:17.655
And that's the unit side, too. You could really 
make a stupid mistake. In this instance, there

09:20.678 --> 09:27.804
wasn't any service

09:20.678 --> 09:27.804
nearby. So I was trying to figure out what we were 
going to do, what could be done, when

09:35.367 --> 09:37.769
It just so happened that this ship came on the air. I 
guess they came on the air because they were kind of

09:39.391 --> 09:45.897
disturbed that they were being

09:39.391 --> 09:45.897
attacked. Not really attacked, but scared. Going 
down. In fact, they'd go down so low they could read

09:50.322 --> 09:54.606
the name on the side. And they come on there. And 
they said, well, we have had a report that you were

09:55.467 --> 10:01.132
captured by the Cubans. Have you been captured? 
They said, oh, no. We haven't been bothered. But we

10:05.101 --> 10:06.923
monitored it. And it says, I have been captured. I 
have captured this name. Well, as it turned out,

10:13.652 --> 10:20.401
this just shows you how the lack of communication 
or improper communication. What the Cubans said,

10:22.524 --> 10:26.529
or the translation was wrong. When they said, I 
have captured, they mean with the eye. I see. And

10:30.254 --> 10:30.855
they were... They were identifying the ship back 
to their headquarters that they were observing.

10:36.360 --> 10:40.404
That shows you how you can get really all brewed up 
during the nighttime or something like that.

10:42.106 --> 10:43.067
Well, that's enough of those. Anyway, every day 
that was something pretty interesting. You must

10:46.831 --> 10:49.554
have really been sort of on the firing line. Well, 
I'm going to have to tell one more because this is

10:51.817 --> 10:56.522
one of the... We had another bombing pause. This is 
separate from the other. We had several, you know,

11:01.489 --> 11:07.498
during the bombing pause.

11:07.518 --> 11:28.247
We had a paper that said, it went out to the far east 
of Westmoreland's command, of which Admiral

11:07.518 --> 11:28.247
Stark and the think tank knew that the president 
had authorized that if you were being attacked,

11:07.518 --> 11:28.247
then you were authorized to commence bombing 
without coming back and getting the president's

11:28.750 --> 11:32.976
permission. Otherwise, do not bomb until 
authority is given from the president.

11:41.128 --> 11:44.172
And this happened on a weekend when everybody's 
gone.

11:47.697 --> 11:57.171
Admiral Stark called in personally, when I was on 
duty, and said that Westmoreland wants us to

11:47.697 --> 11:57.171
resume the bombing. And Westmoreland didn't 
control the bombing. Think back. He just had the

12:00.655 --> 12:04.360
ground war. And I'd like to have permission, says 
Admiral Stark, to commence bombing. I said, sir, I

12:10.609 --> 12:14.435
can't give you an answer now, but I'll call you back 
in just a few minutes. Well, General Wheeler, who

12:15.416 --> 12:19.262
was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs at that time, 
wasn't there. The acting chief, chairman, was the

12:24.607 --> 12:26.629
Air Force General, Grok. I can't recall his name 
right now. And he said, well, that's easy. He says,

12:33.758 --> 12:38.664
you just tell Admiral Stark to commence bombing. I 
said, well, don't you think we better refer this to

12:38.684 --> 12:44.090
at least the Secretary of Defense? No. But we have 
the piece of paper. Tell him to go ahead. I'll take

12:50.158 --> 12:53.702
full responsibility.

12:54.020 --> 13:01.170
He really wasn't in a position to take full, even 
though he was active chief, but this was a little

12:54.020 --> 13:01.170
bit stronger medicine. Well, now I'm on the spot. 
Am I going to disregard a four-star general that

13:02.912 --> 13:08.440
really I'm working for in the MCC? Well, Vance was 
always a good, steady pre-NC to all of us, and he was

13:10.623 --> 13:19.415
the deputy secretary of defense. Sonny Vance, 
yeah. So I called him up. And of course, he was hard

13:22.184 --> 13:25.528
to get a hold of, because he was out guest 
somewhere. And I had to run down several times as a

13:25.568 --> 13:30.273
guest in an office somewhere. And that makes it 
difficult, because you can't talk classified.

13:33.237 --> 13:34.598
Now you're next out again. Because all of this is 
monitored. Everything we said is taped. It's

13:38.082 --> 13:44.930
taped for protection, both of the people that 
you're talking with, and also to be sure they're

13:38.082 --> 13:44.930
accurate. Who said what? I wanted it taped. 
Terrible things can happen with mistakes like

13:48.965 --> 13:51.028
that. So I called him up and I said,

13:51.909 --> 14:06.528
the acting chairman had given Admiral Stark the 
green light to commence bombing him. And there was

14:06.548 --> 14:08.030
a long pause. I said, hello, sir, are you still 
there? He said, yes, I'm still there. I said, is

14:15.037 --> 14:17.420
there anything you want me to do? I just wanted to be 
sure you were informed. He said, no, you don't do

14:20.965 --> 14:23.449
anything. Take it from a collar. I'll take it from 
here. And I never heard any repercussions from

14:26.754 --> 14:29.317
that. So apparently, I'm sure that was something. 
So you didn't give Stark the green light? Oh, no. Or

14:37.069 --> 14:37.549
did you? No, that's another thing. After he told me 
that, after I talked to Vance, We still had the

14:46.913 --> 14:51.299
responsibility.

14:54.182 --> 14:55.604
And I told him what I was going to do. I didn't recite 
this very accurately because that's what I was

14:55.684 --> 14:59.830
told to do. And he paused a long time and said, oh, 
that's all right. Thank you for calling. I'll

15:06.158 --> 15:07.179
handle it from here. So I called Admiral Stark back 
and told him that it was affirmative. And then I got

15:13.964 --> 15:17.710
to thinking, what he needs is an order. He ought to 
have that in writing. So I called back the

15:19.953 --> 15:23.599
gentleman and I said, I think this ought to be in 
writing. I relate orally

15:23.920 --> 15:33.375
of what you directed, but I think he ought to have a 
message. Oh, no, he don't need a message.

15:37.321 --> 15:39.024
And he said, all right, send one if you want to. I 
said, who shall I have sign? Your name? Yeah, I'll

15:42.297 --> 15:43.479
sign it Monday. So we sent off a message 
confirming. I'll say it never was any

15:46.345 --> 15:56.827
repercussion, so I don't know what dance he 
probably called the president and told him.

15:56.848 --> 15:58.511
We'll have to get off of that one. Well, I wanted to 
know, there's a number of things at first I want to

15:59.032 --> 16:02.820
know about this. this job in the Pentagon. That 
sounds absolutely fascinating. One is, during

16:07.091 --> 16:17.741
this time there was a tremendous increase in the 
technology that America was using in fighting the

16:07.091 --> 16:17.741
war in Vietnam in a space program. Was technology, 
and you've already alluded to this when you talked

16:17.761 --> 16:31.474
about the communication possibilities, but was 
technology, were there examples of rapid

16:17.761 --> 16:31.474
increase in new technologies in the Pentagon at 
this time?

16:33.327 --> 16:40.198
This new communication system had just been 
installed, so I don't know of any... So during that

16:40.218 --> 16:44.905
year, it was installed just before I got there, so 
I...

16:48.651 --> 16:55.102
I don't know of anything...

16:48.651 --> 16:55.102
And they were computerizing a lot of things, too. 
Aside from... This was a day-to-day hour, many for

16:57.666 --> 17:00.330
many, but... A lot of the things that we had files of 
being placed on the computer. But I don't know of

17:09.144 --> 17:20.595
any, as you say, any dramatic additions we had or 
changes due to the space program or the

17:09.144 --> 17:20.595
development of technology. Now, why did you only 
stay on this job for one year and then you went to

17:20.615 --> 17:25.200
Chief Far Eastern Division? Because it was a 
one-year tour of duty. And you got reassigned.

17:28.483 --> 17:29.524
Everybody, they figured it. One year is all that 
also should be there. And also for his own benefit,

17:33.864 --> 17:37.449
you would want him. True. Gosh, actually, you've 
done that a few months. Now, the troops invaded the

17:42.076 --> 17:45.380
Dominican Republic in 1966. Were you on the 
hotline there? Yeah. Not there because, I'm glad

17:48.966 --> 17:55.275
you mentioned that, because whenever there's a 
troubled spot, they don't expect, The flag also on

17:55.998 --> 17:58.121
duty to handle that. You immediately set up a task 
force. Sure. It's in an MC. There are rooms for the

18:02.427 --> 18:04.871
task force. And that task force handles it. Even 
their communications come right in there. So the

18:11.921 --> 18:13.863
Dominican Republic was handled. And that task 
force is similar. You've got CIA, State

18:15.526 --> 18:21.074
Department, Department of Defense. They're in a 
room right next to you. Yeah. So they can get all the

18:23.622 --> 18:26.907
information they need as fast as possible. That's 
right, from us and from our facility and also from

18:27.047 --> 18:30.232
them. Of course, they had to use the same 
communication. And that was very active. Also in

18:36.221 --> 18:50.423
NMC, we produced every day a top secret, I won't 
call it a newspaper, but it's more of a pamphlet or a

18:36.221 --> 18:50.423
magazine type of thing. And that was our response. 
We had to go to press early enough to get it all, to

18:54.070 --> 19:07.149
confirm the accuracy before the people who were 
deceived arrived. And that would be the Chairman,

19:07.229 --> 19:13.498
Joint Chiefs, Secretary of Defense, and people of 
that category. And it had a box score, the number of

19:13.518 --> 19:19.026
strikes we made during the last 24-hour period. 
the number of planes we lost, what assessment we

19:20.103 --> 19:26.471
had of the damage. But usually you had it because 
the reconnaissance plane flew right after you

19:26.811 --> 19:38.486
took a picture, and the carrier, and from 
otherwise too. And summer of the ground action,

19:38.506 --> 19:42.811
where it occurred, that's right. Number of 
casualties, number of prisoners taken, if any.

19:49.229 --> 19:53.813
Later on, that crazy body count was stupid. The 
press forced that on them, you know. But tell me

19:56.015 --> 19:57.516
about that body count. Of course, a number of 
people have said that that's distorted, and even a

19:57.556 --> 20:04.983
number of generals have said that the body count 
was distorted. What were your feelings on that?

20:06.684 --> 20:10.207
Well, I'm sure it was distorted. Why did you say it 
was stupid? Because they never should have

20:12.369 --> 20:13.670
started it. The media forced it on them. I'm not 
blaming them for the poor body feelings, but But

20:19.402 --> 20:23.367
they gave an estimate, like you normally do 
anywhere. We estimate 15 or 20 or whatever. So they

20:27.532 --> 20:28.433
put the pressure. What do you mean, estimate? 
Either you know or you don't know what you base your

20:30.996 --> 20:33.699
estimate on. So they keep pressing them like that 
to where they'd have to actually, that's how they

20:34.841 --> 20:39.687
got the body counts. How do you know? Well, we sent 
somebody out and they counted the body. But that's

20:45.233 --> 20:46.395
the worst thing here. Who? Who goes and counts the 
bodies? You don't go up and count children, dogs,

20:49.267 --> 20:56.736
and all other bodies. But that's kind of a callous 
way. Of course, war is a terrible thing the way you

21:00.961 --> 21:05.146
look at it. But when you start, it would be much 
better, I think, to just give an estimate. And I'm

21:11.874 --> 21:13.616
saying that estimate is exaggerated. It probably 
was, or is. But that's a more... civilized way, I

21:17.705 --> 21:20.731
think. But you weren't directly involved in any of 
the planning or staging of the Dominican Republic

21:20.751 --> 21:26.962
situation. No. They set up a task force. Oh, we did. 
It was monitored. And it was well underway when I

21:33.635 --> 21:35.498
came in there. That was one of my first tasks force. 
OK. I'd like you just to give your opinion of some of

21:41.617 --> 21:49.810
the people that you worked with who were very 
important during this time as far as national

21:41.617 --> 21:49.810
affairs. And one of the most controversial is 
Robert Mackinac.

21:55.519 --> 22:07.238
Well,

21:55.519 --> 22:07.238
he's really a difficult one to...

21:55.519 --> 22:07.238
Once again, brilliant mind. Yeah. Brilliant.

22:11.772 --> 22:16.679
And he thinks he's usually ahead of the people 
mentally. And therefore, like, makes him

22:18.222 --> 22:20.866
impatient.

22:23.630 --> 22:34.246
And he particularly, if somebody would ask him a 
question of what he just said, like, that was

22:23.630 --> 22:34.246
really, he'd be impatient with that because he'd 
say, well, didn't you hear what I just said? Of

22:34.426 --> 22:37.771
course, what this person means, maybe I heard it, 
but I don't quite understand it. But he didn't like

22:38.512 --> 22:40.615
people like that around him, you see. And he 
surrounded himself with some brain. When they

22:45.330 --> 22:51.958
talked about the whiz kids, he got some really 
sharp, bright young people. Most of them are

22:53.179 --> 22:55.041
scientifically trained. And many of them didn't 
understand the weapons of war or how you fight a

22:56.323 --> 23:03.591
war. But they were good because with their system 
analysis, They tried to fight or win the war by

23:10.784 --> 23:14.469
system analysis. And of course, if you could ever 
do that, we really progressed. That would be good

23:17.292 --> 23:19.956
where you don't even need people in the field. For 
example, the development of the electronics

23:21.978 --> 23:29.167
defense. We were going to put that in, and nobody 
could penetrate because of monitoring. But all

23:36.136 --> 23:38.079
sorts of things happened for them. It cost a lot of 
money. That was the system analysis of whiz kids

23:41.446 --> 23:46.571
and developing those things. But McNamara,

23:47.291 --> 23:57.521
he was a positive and he was friendly in his own cold 
way. You know, you didn't expect him to be smiling

23:58.342 --> 24:00.804
like that. But he could kind of look at you with his 
eyes kind of half closed and kind of nod at you. You

24:08.471 --> 24:09.512
knew that. Apparently, everything's not so bad. 
He was impatient with generals, admirals, and

24:14.206 --> 24:37.137
probably so because when you spend, say, 25 or 30 
years in the military, all different situations,

24:14.206 --> 24:37.137
different places, you seem to assess the 
situation based on your education, background,

24:14.206 --> 24:37.137
experience, and so forth. If you've got a civilian 
that hasn't trod that long rocky path, he comes

24:37.808 --> 24:42.500
from over here. And he sees it, and it's good to have 
him to look at it, because he may see a lot of fresh

24:42.540 --> 24:52.847
new things that could be done and will be done. But 
this guy here seems to be, and I guess I'm being

24:53.671 --> 25:02.261
impatient, I guess I figure that these generals 
are kind of slow and they put the status quo and they

24:53.671 --> 25:02.261
haven't had a new idea in years. They're all 
training to fight the last war and never can

25:02.302 --> 25:10.632
foresee or project to create the future. So, and 
these young guys, they weren't handicapped by

25:10.652 --> 25:17.460
experience. You know, they're willing to try 
anything. Well, they wouldn't call it trial and

25:20.755 --> 25:30.249
error, but it would be a... And I never heard any of 
them say something was wrong. If it didn't pan out,

25:30.269 --> 25:36.037
it was because something had been overlooked. So I 
guess what I'm saying is they saw the world

25:36.057 --> 25:40.884
entirely different than we saw it. But we knew we 
had to do the fighting. And we were responsible.

25:46.111 --> 25:50.037
Just like, look at that desert fiasco in Iran. 
Everybody says the military becomes a joke, and

25:50.962 --> 25:55.347
they shouldn't be. Aircraft maintenance is poor. 
You know, everything. Why can't we learn to do at

25:58.890 --> 26:03.295
least as well as Israel can do, see, with all of 
that? So we get the responsibility for whatever

26:03.335 --> 26:08.761
goes wrong or something doesn't work. That's the 
reason I'm talking about Korea. Yet,

26:12.585 --> 26:20.293
people change things or alter them, and then at the 
last moment, They'll change their mind and say,

26:21.623 --> 26:24.426
well, I was wrong. Fulbright said that, you 
remember, about the Gulf of Tonkin. He said, yes, I

26:28.531 --> 26:29.933
voted for it. I led. I was the president's 
spokesman on that. But I was wrong, because I bring

26:33.537 --> 26:37.301
back 50,000 young men.

26:41.686 --> 26:45.150
But McNamara had these real fine guys. Was there a 
lot of jealousy between, or not jealousy,

26:46.463 --> 26:56.535
antagonism, I guess, hard feelings between 
McNamara and the Whiz Kids and the upper echelon

26:46.463 --> 26:56.535
military? Not so much with McNamara, but he really 
had some youngsters that, for example, Halpern is

26:57.616 --> 27:07.768
one. You may recognize his name. He's the one who's 
had the most. Martin Halpern. Martin Halpern. You

27:12.313 --> 27:13.074
ever meet him? No, he's a historian. The one who 
sued Kissinger. It was Kissinger and everybody

27:18.668 --> 27:21.671
else. Martin Halpern had just finished Harvard, 
Ph.D. He came to the Pentagon Department of

27:28.019 --> 27:43.056
Defense as a, what do you call him, research 
analysis, you know, a fellow, a White House

27:28.019 --> 27:43.056
fellow. Well, he wasn't a White House fellow. I 
said, maybe I'll think of the word in a few minutes.

27:50.069 --> 27:56.296
Of course, they come in for a year for experience, 
and they're really studying government

27:50.069 --> 27:56.296
functions. He was so intrigued with it, he stayed 
on. He came to the Pentagon with preconceived

28:00.440 --> 28:05.445
ideas on everything. And he wouldn't listen. I 
served on committees with him. In the Far East

28:09.569 --> 28:14.014
Division, we had a committee

28:15.209 --> 28:16.911
Bill Bundy was on. Brzezinski, you know, the 
former. Sure. He was on that committee. Halbert

28:23.359 --> 28:24.280
was on it. I was on it. I represented joint staff. 
Halbert represented the Department of Defense.

28:31.910 --> 28:37.056
And we addressed, this was the Far East Division, 
this joint. Did you have a State Department

28:37.757 --> 28:39.739
official on that too? Yeah, he chaired it. Bundy 
chaired it. Oh, okay. Bunded State had the Far

28:42.378 --> 28:44.780
East. That was his area. CIA man on that, too? Yeah. 
And he was the one name I couldn't remember who

28:48.644 --> 28:53.229
later became the chief. So we had Brzezinski. DIA 
on that, too?

29:02.878 --> 29:07.022
You know, I don't remember about DIA, but they must 
have been on that. OK, but what about an offering

29:07.042 --> 29:09.665
then? Well, there was a paper. that had been 
approved by the president of which, on this

29:13.023 --> 29:21.453
particular committee, and this was for the Far 
East, they had similar committees to other parts

29:13.023 --> 29:21.453
of the world. And in it, it said, it was perfectly 
written that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had a vote,

29:22.655 --> 29:33.768
and the Department of Defense had a vote. Halperin 
said, the Joint Chiefs are subordinate to the

29:33.788 --> 29:41.578
Department of Defense, therefore, You cannot 
vote differently than I do. And I said, but the

29:48.153 --> 29:50.215
paper, here it is right here. He says, I don't care. 
Now, he had been misled because before we went, we

29:53.077 --> 29:58.562
always had a subject agenda, of course. And we 
would develop position papers. And we always,

30:00.844 --> 30:06.109
before that, would take them over to Halpert for 
his agreement. And there was another young man

30:06.509 --> 30:10.292
also from New York. He worked on the transition. 
team I noticed here a while back. He's a lawyer from

30:15.662 --> 30:17.004
New York. Because we weren't coordinated, and of 
course it would be unusual for us to really

30:19.608 --> 30:25.838
disagree, but there was disagreement. He said he 
don't have the vote. Well, we disagreed, so we went

30:28.603 --> 30:34.853
ahead and voted, and Halbert said, I object. Mr. 
Chairman, because the Joint Chiefs do not have a

30:35.508 --> 30:45.180
separate vote, and this is counter to our vote, and 
I represent the Department of Defense of

30:35.508 --> 30:45.180
McNamara. And I thought I disagreed, and I quoted 
the paper. Bundy ruled that, for the time being,

30:49.746 --> 30:58.697
since the paper said two votes, that he would rule 
in my favor. So the record will show that defense

30:58.717 --> 31:03.102
positions one in power over the other. Later on, 
they supported the paper. They didn't have to

31:06.545 --> 31:09.088
change the paper. They fired everybody. So they 
purposely wanted the Joint Chiefs to have a vote in

31:11.050 --> 31:17.859
these committees to represent the uniformed 
military as opposed to the other. There wasn't any

31:18.721 --> 31:20.703
world-shaking problem at all. But it was just 
Halperin's attitude. Is that what you're saying?

31:23.767 --> 31:27.072
Yeah, and that was his attitude on a lot of other 
things. Then we finally got... It was just

31:28.053 --> 31:30.736
uncooperative, or was that his deal? 
Hard-headed. He thought, I guess he was an example

31:34.081 --> 31:41.869
of what Ted Walsh was telling about some Ivy League 
type. I'd hate to be working for Halverson. It

31:44.072 --> 31:46.074
would be impossible to get along with him. But he 
didn't understand. Never had any military

31:47.555 --> 31:49.257
training. He'd never been a private or ever been a 
Boy Scout. Well, finally, he left the Department

31:54.683 --> 31:59.388
of Defense, and everybody just cheered. And why 
did he show up over? in the White House working for

32:03.612 --> 32:07.116
Kissinger.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.343
And he started doing the same thing over there. Of 
course, I had left then. I went down to Fort Monroe,

32:13.985 --> 32:18.150
so I didn't have any dealings with him after he left 
the department then. And I wasn't surprised at all

32:19.852 --> 32:23.716
to find out that he would be involved. And I wasn't 
surprised to find out he was going to carry this

32:23.776 --> 32:27.561
suit to the Supreme Court. See, the settlement was 
a dollar, and now since they won in the Supreme

32:28.823 --> 32:34.870
Court, they want to raise it to several million 
dollars. The old principle at the beginning, but

32:34.890 --> 32:39.156
now he wants to make his million. There was another 
guy, and I can't recall his name, but he was a

32:40.578 --> 32:49.529
partner of Halpern, and he went over to the State 
Department. He messed us up in the Defense

32:49.549 --> 32:52.813
Department. He went over and did the same thing 
with Halpern in the White House. I meant the White

32:56.838 --> 32:58.780
House, not the State Department. Now, what about 
Brzezinski? What was your opinion of him? Oh, he's

33:04.241 --> 33:17.573
probably the, of all of the guys that I've met 
around two years, he's probably the most

33:04.241 --> 33:17.573
brilliant. And everybody agrees with that, even 
with his. But sometimes he thinks, he's got a

33:21.496 --> 33:27.321
creative mind. He's always thinking ahead.

33:32.037 --> 33:36.845
And he's way ahead, even McNamara, he's ahead of 
him on it. Of course, he doesn't have the training,

33:36.865 --> 33:41.893
the scientific training that old McNamara had. 
Brzezinski has an idea, a concept, and a solution

33:42.414 --> 33:48.063
on every single problem. So when we meet as a 
committee, and we even met to devise a way to end the

33:48.344 --> 33:56.998
war in Vietnam, Couldn't get together, of course, 
because everybody... We made a trip to Vietnam

33:58.447 --> 34:03.011
together. We got briefed at all levels. When was 
that?

34:10.298 --> 34:14.703
Well, it was before Khe Sanh was attacked. You 
remember that went on for quite some time. LBJ

34:16.705 --> 34:27.475
promised the nation, he says, the Joint Chiefs 
assured me Khe Sanh will not fall, which it didn't.

34:28.754 --> 34:32.578
But we went to Khe Sanh, went to all of them, all over 
Vietnam. And the situation wasn't so bad then. In

34:37.683 --> 34:40.646
fact, that was the light at the end of the tunnel. 
Everybody was seeing things. But Brzezinski, I

34:44.490 --> 34:46.932
just can't praise him enough. Now, I've noticed 
this critique of his service in the Security

34:47.933 --> 34:57.343
Council was that brilliant mind, Great concept, 
great vision. But then he didn't have the ability

35:03.798 --> 35:10.007
to implement. When you get right down there, this 
is great. Now, how do we get there from here? See,

35:13.672 --> 35:17.337
now we've got to do this and this other thing. He 
lost interest at that level. So you needed

35:19.159 --> 35:27.651
somebody else to come over that followed him and 
everything he did, and then come back and build a

35:19.159 --> 35:27.651
place, a building block, where he could finally 
get to the objective. But you would really be

35:28.542 --> 35:32.426
impressed if you just sit down and hear that guy 
talk. What about Bundy? Bundy, too. Bundy, by the

35:36.310 --> 35:41.235
way, was on the firing line Sunday, whatever. He's 
head of the Foreign Affairs magazine. Bill Bundy.

35:49.563 --> 35:51.065
Yeah. He's a quiet, tall individual and not 
impressive at all.

36:02.343 --> 36:15.881
I mean, what he does, obviously, he wouldn't be 
editor of this foreign affairs magazine,

36:02.343 --> 36:15.881
but you'd have to be around him, and I wasn't around 
him that much. He always seemed to be preoccupied.

36:19.205 --> 36:28.217
He'd come to our meetings late because he chaired 
them, and he didn't seem to always make himself

36:19.205 --> 36:28.217
busy on very important issues. I don't know. Up to 
speed on what had been done and where we were. So he

36:35.316 --> 36:38.380
had a little guy, and I forgot his name. He ended up 
later being ambassador to Korea that carried the

36:38.400 --> 36:44.747
ball for Bundy on the sport. He knew all about 
everything. But he was a feisty little guy. And he

36:50.874 --> 36:52.736
was a hawk. Bundy was a dove. Of course, he's 
probably

36:56.020 --> 37:01.206
correct. You're not necessarily a dove if you 
don't agree with what's doing. Maybe a hawk on what

37:05.623 --> 37:07.225
you think is right. Of course, you also said that 
you knew Cyrus Vance. Yeah. Would you describe

37:13.011 --> 37:13.932
him?

37:17.396 --> 37:25.744
Very friendly,

37:17.396 --> 37:25.744
humble type of individual. Humility.

37:30.835 --> 37:40.544
He's interested to know what you think of your 
ideas, not like McNamara, who doesn't care your

37:30.835 --> 37:40.544
ideas. You know, he's already solved the problem, 
and you're wasting my time. Resentka, the same

37:45.148 --> 37:46.409
thing. He's already got his ideas concept.

37:52.434 --> 37:54.056
He too is way ahead. But Vance is a, and I think he's 
been criticized in, the Secretary of State for

37:59.371 --> 38:01.054
this. He wasn't necessarily a fighter. He seemed 
to be more of a team player.

38:12.031 --> 38:18.181
He doesn't want to create a diversified

38:12.031 --> 38:18.181
views. He'd like to pull them together.

38:25.192 --> 38:27.015
He would even come into the MCC, He'd almost always 
preface his remarks, he'd like to know this, but

38:27.940 --> 38:34.348
don't.

38:38.193 --> 38:39.796
I hope it doesn't appear or something else. You 
know, when Deputy Secretary of Defense comes in

38:40.076 --> 38:45.323
and says, I want this done, you know, you figure out 
how you're going to do it. Sure. That's what I mean

38:45.964 --> 38:48.667
by humility. He certainly wasn't arrogant. And I 
think the Secretary of State, the way he ran that,

38:56.594 --> 39:03.706
But I was a little surprised and kind of proud of him 
when he resigned because of that raid in Iran. So

39:04.487 --> 39:10.537
with this white appearance, they have a strong 
mind and principle.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.565
Of course, he was very knowledgeable. He had been 
Secretary of the Army. He had been Deputy

39:17.569 --> 39:22.517
Secretary of Defense, which means that they carry 
a big load. of coordinating and running it,

39:23.003 --> 39:26.567
particularly getting into the budgetary. Then he 
got to be Secretary of State. So he really knew his

39:29.590 --> 39:31.171
way around. And he knew the military, certainly 
the Army. But he was on top of the information. He

39:39.499 --> 39:41.101
knew he was preparing. And I like him. I admire him. 
I think he's a real fine gentleman. It's a pity that

39:48.709 --> 39:51.171
we couldn't temper

39:53.075 --> 40:08.450
somewhere between Haig and Vance would be a real 
good solid Secretary of State, you know, not too

39:53.075 --> 40:08.450
positive and too strong in strong-minded views or 
saying things that Haig does. This is it, you know,

40:09.130 --> 40:20.061
just a declaration of a fact when maybe it should be 
a declaration of a study, ongoing study that we're

40:09.130 --> 40:20.061
looking at. Did you happen to get to know Alexander 
Hague at this time? No. He wasn't in the White House

40:25.073 --> 40:26.634
then at all. No, he was not. He was still a 
low-ranking colonel somewhere around in the

40:27.535 --> 40:31.339
Army. Well, he was in Vietnam, that's where he was. 
Tell me what you did as Chief Far Eastern Division

40:34.022 --> 40:41.870
when you left the National Military Command 
Center for the next two years. Yeah, when I talk

40:41.910 --> 40:46.175
about this committee with State, this is as a chief 
here. The Chief of the Far East Division He is in

40:50.230 --> 41:19.765
charge of all plans concerning the area, which, of 
course, is designated as Japan and Korea, the

40:50.230 --> 41:19.765
Philippines, Taiwan,

40:50.230 --> 41:19.765
Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Burma, Thailand, 
Indonesia, and the islands in the Pacific, which

40:50.230 --> 41:19.765
we're

40:50.230 --> 41:19.765
not custodian. Territories. Territory, yeah. 
That was included and that came into active play

41:25.720 --> 41:34.952
because then they were still discussing, you 
know, what were they going, what's going to be the

41:25.720 --> 41:34.952
status. Freedom would become a commonwealth. And 
what was your I mean, when you are chief, obviously

41:42.982 --> 41:50.810
you're not dealing with the command decisions in 
Vietnam, although that's in the Far East

41:42.982 --> 41:50.810
Division. What exactly are you dealing with? 
Policy planning? You have a good point. Since

41:57.356 --> 42:06.986
Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia was an active 
theater, this became operational planning. So

42:07.406 --> 42:11.390
that was taken out of our shop. Now, long-range 
planning if we're talking about what will happen

42:13.593 --> 42:20.001
as a cessation of hostilities. And that would come 
in our ear.

42:25.489 --> 42:27.291
Thailand was in between, see? That's supposed to 
be neutral. So we have a lot of planning to do with

42:30.015 --> 42:35.502
Thailand, because they have a member of CETO. 
That's all changed now. And that would come under

42:37.825 --> 42:38.986
us. When CETO had a meeting in Washington, for 
example, my division was responsible for

42:43.546 --> 42:54.600
organizing and planning the meeting, which 
brings back to McNamara. Mrs. McNamara, bless her

42:54.680 --> 43:00.447
soul, she recently ceased from cancer. We had all 
this planned. And so of all things, now this is like

43:04.933 --> 43:10.800
the detail I could expect Jimmy Carter to ask for. 
She asked for the list. of liquor, kinds of liquor,

43:13.853 --> 43:18.179
that we were going to serve. Where? At this 
reception. Oh, at a reception. The Cito Meats

43:23.928 --> 43:29.576
business bar and the social that followed it. So we 
had listed Smirnoff Vodka and Cutty Sorts,

43:29.596 --> 43:35.444
Scotch. She came back and she changed all of them. 
Two-inch pegs that cut back some cutting saw to a

43:40.162 --> 43:47.933
cheaper stock and spurred off back to a cheaper 
vodka. And all across the board. And she really

43:51.678 --> 43:56.645
didn't have anything to do about it, except she 
did, of course, he had a responsibility for it. She

43:56.665 --> 43:58.728
was just interested in keeping costs there. I 
thought that was, to me, an interesting sideline

43:59.870 --> 44:07.661
of what Ms. McNamara was doing, her attention to 
detail. Then I had a division, an organization,

44:07.681 --> 44:10.084
where But people were organized by country. In 
some cases, more than one country was divided up.

44:17.706 --> 44:31.418
So any paper that comes to us, and it could be 
generated by the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marines

44:17.706 --> 44:31.418
concerning our area, we would handle it and staff 
it through the Joint Chiefs. And there's a regular

44:31.438 --> 44:36.162
way you may know it with different colors they call 
them. And that indicates the stage that you're in

44:36.182 --> 44:39.885
when you start out. you end up buff, you know, you 
work it. When you finally get it to where everybody

44:43.855 --> 44:50.726
agrees it's ready to go to Joint Chiefs, then it is 
actually a green color. And then when they agree to

44:51.928 --> 44:58.197
it, I've already forgotten what color it is, it's 
published in a different color. So that's the

44:58.217 --> 45:00.701
short way to say, what's the status of this? You 
say, well, it's still in the buff. And then you have

45:05.108 --> 45:06.210
to arg it. or be prepared to argue to the Joint 
Chiefs when they meet. You have to answer all the

45:13.366 --> 45:16.650
questions about it. Now they have, they're 
prepared because their staff has studied it and

45:16.690 --> 45:26.142
used and made notes, changes, or additions. So 
sometimes it doesn't, it can take hours,

45:26.162 --> 45:31.928
sometimes days before it's ever done. But much of 
the discussion, of course, there's

45:31.948 --> 45:38.256
many things narrowed down to budget. in the Army 
Navy Air Force, sure, nobody would accept a change

45:38.725 --> 45:51.925
that would end up saying, well, you just gave up one 
squadron of aircraft, but this means two more

45:38.725 --> 45:51.925
ships going to multiple things. How many men did 
you have under your command as chief? I think about

45:56.772 --> 45:57.613
20. About 20, and they were probably all officers? 
Yeah. Oh, yeah, they were. And they were all

46:02.500 --> 46:05.685
experts in certain fields, in certain countries? 
They were all colonels or... or captains of the

46:08.020 --> 46:12.306
Navy.

46:12.326 --> 46:12.667
And what? Do you remember what your plans were for 
future Vietnam?

46:21.279 --> 46:34.719
No, not really, because

46:21.279 --> 46:34.719
the plan was to restore the stability of the 
government and have it operated out of Seoul. I

46:35.660 --> 46:36.762
mean, out of Saigon.

46:40.015 --> 46:44.740
Did you feel that in your job, anybody was 
listening to you? Or was the Vietnamese word so

46:44.980 --> 46:54.629
important that they didn't worry about the future 
plans for the Philippines or for Japan or

46:44.980 --> 46:54.629
whatever? Well, of course, the plans are...

46:54.649 --> 47:05.500
Actually, all the focus was on Vietnam to get 
there.
