00:02.562 --> 00:24.330
First of all, Mr. Hale, would you tell us something 
about your early life, including the names of your

00:02.562 --> 00:24.330
parents, and if you remember them or know them, the 
dates and places of their birth and death, the date

00:02.562 --> 00:24.330
and place of your birth, the schools you attended 
before you came to Texas A&M, and whatever else you

00:02.562 --> 00:24.330
can remember about your childhood. My father and 
mother, my father's name was William Brewer Hale.

00:31.739 --> 00:38.927
And my mother was from, they were both from 
Tennessee. And her name was Alice Mitchell before

00:40.569 --> 00:44.053
she married. And the father came to Texas in 1883 
and settled in Coffman County. The reason he came

00:55.465 --> 01:01.712
to Texas, they had a smallpox back there in 
Jonesboro, Tennessee, and he had an uncle living

00:55.465 --> 01:01.712
down here. The uncle rode him and told him he'd come 
and see of him until the smallpox rolled. In those

01:08.049 --> 01:10.731
days, you know, smallpox kill you. They didn't 
have much way to be treated. So he came here in 1883

01:16.317 --> 01:25.287
and he liked it and so he stayed. In 1886 he went back 
to Tennessee and married this girl Alice

01:25.307 --> 01:30.973
Mitchell. So my mother and father then lived down 
here in Kauffman County from 1886 to 1900 when he

01:31.983 --> 01:45.683
moved out to Swisher County, Tudor, Texas. There 
wasn't a railroad there then. The Litten Years

01:49.229 --> 01:51.933
Railroad was at Canyon. And so we lived on the ranks 
28 miles south of Canyon for five years. And the

01:57.281 --> 01:59.644
railroad first came to Tudor in 1906. So I went, in 
1906 then, my dad moved to town so his kids could go

02:01.902 --> 02:06.166
to school. He had four boys and two girls.

02:10.711 --> 02:16.137
And we were seven years old before he'd go to school 
when I was a kid.

02:17.058 --> 02:22.623
But I skipped one grade, third grade got crowded 
and they sent three of us to the fourth. And I had to

02:23.084 --> 02:26.207
be one of those three. So that would make me famous, 
start school when I was six. So I got out of school. I

02:32.272 --> 02:34.294
graduated from Tule High School in 1918. Now you 
were born what year then? Born in 1900. 1900. That

02:40.282 --> 02:42.905
would be the year your family moved to? Yeah, I was 
born in May and they moved in 1901.

02:50.996 --> 02:56.443
In December 1901 to Swish County.

02:56.463 --> 02:56.563
Okay. And you graduated from Tulia High School in 
May of 1918 and that's the only school you had gone

02:57.505 --> 03:05.656
to in Tulia.

03:08.360 --> 03:11.324
What factors were involved in your choice of Texas 
A&M? Well the superintendent of the school told us

03:12.546 --> 03:26.145
that they had a military program going on here and 
also an educational program at A&M we could get in

03:12.546 --> 03:26.145
both of them because we had to sign up when we're 18 
years old, September the 12th, just a little while

03:27.087 --> 03:32.294
before school started here. And he says, if we come 
down here, they let us go to school and stay here

03:33.215 --> 03:38.743
until March next year. But he says, if the war was 
over before then, we'd be gaining a lot by coming

03:39.744 --> 03:49.678
here and getting in the SATC and also going to 
school. And three of us did that. It was one of the

03:52.990 --> 03:55.714
best things that ever happened to me. I sure was 
glad of it. Of course, we had a hard time that year

03:57.736 --> 04:01.662
because of the flu. There was some regular Army 
people here besides the students in those days,

04:02.863 --> 04:12.997
and counting the regular Army boys and the 
students too, there was about 80 boys died here

04:02.863 --> 04:12.997
that fall. But I never did have the flu. You were one 
of the lucky ones. Well, the lucky ones never did

04:16.562 --> 04:21.428
have the flu, but we had to head down to the hospital 
and off hours. because they didn't have enough

04:22.657 --> 04:24.479
help. And then when the war was over, well, we just 
started regular classwork in school. We was going

04:35.011 --> 04:39.256
to school anyway, but it upset it a little bit, but 
not too much. We didn't, we still graduated in

04:39.717 --> 04:46.605
time, in four years time, just like it never had 
happened. So from that September when you

04:46.737 --> 04:58.549
enrolled until January, I believe, when they 
started kind of a new school year, particularly

04:46.737 --> 04:58.549
for those who had been away, you actually attended 
regular classes. Yes. Plus, did you have to do some

04:59.590 --> 05:02.452
additional drilling? Oh, yeah. You see, we had to 
do additional drilling and trench digging

05:02.673 --> 05:10.220
because that was a trench warfare in World War I. 
And we dug a lot of trenches around here. And did a

05:13.805 --> 05:16.748
lot of bandit practice and stuff like that. And 
then had a military manual that we studied. And the

05:22.654 --> 05:29.101
army really had a pretty good program. There's 
only one thing that was about it. The officers we

05:35.067 --> 05:39.072
had down here had only 90 days training before they 
came down here. And every one of the officers named

05:39.932 --> 05:43.356
down here began with a K. Keese, Kennedy, King, and 
all that came down here from Wisconsin or

05:43.724 --> 05:48.190
somewhere. And they didn't even know how to put us 
in the mess hall to eat our meals. We'd go up to the

05:53.036 --> 06:00.646
steps, and then they'd say, Squad 1, forward 
march, and set the table, then Squad 2. Well, we had

06:01.568 --> 06:08.076
some juniors here that were still here in school, 
and they finally called on them to help them a

06:01.568 --> 06:08.076
little bit. They didn't even know how to hold a 
tree. And these juniors got him in line. They'd

06:12.670 --> 06:15.475
been schooled here three years, see. And it worked 
out all right. But if I was, although that flew and

06:19.162 --> 06:23.350
we had a lot of misery and all, If I were going to 
school at A&M again and could pick my years, I'd

06:24.460 --> 06:32.310
pick 18 to 22, just like I had before. You mentioned 
the SATC. Students Army Training Corps.

06:37.577 --> 06:39.539
Otherwise known as Stay Around Till Christmas. 
Yeah, or Safe at the College. I've not heard Safe at

06:42.543 --> 06:44.305
the College before. You haven't heard that one? 
No, no. Dr. Hedges told me that one. Oh, is that,

06:48.010 --> 06:52.155
those are kind of... Kind of like Aggie Jokes. 
Aggie Jokes are, I'm trying to think of the word,

06:53.805 --> 06:58.333
names that the students would use. Oh, yeah. 
Students give everybody a name.

07:05.906 --> 07:14.921
You indicated earlier about, say, at the time you 
graduated from high school, when you reached your

07:05.906 --> 07:14.921
18th year, you had to sign up. I had to sign up 
September the 12th. That is, that everybody who

07:17.887 --> 07:24.699
was 18 or more had to register for the draft. That 
was the first draft that we'd had in a long time. I

07:28.646 --> 07:35.477
know the North had a draft during the Civil War, 
which was not very popular. By that date,

07:36.920 --> 07:39.464
everybody who was 18 had to sign up. That's right, 
by September the 12th.

07:46.658 --> 07:53.167
Had you had any prior knowledge to what life was 
like at A&M before you came here? Well, my mother

07:53.207 --> 07:55.890
tried to get me not to come here. She wanted me to go 
to Baylor. And I don't know where she got all this

07:58.073 --> 08:07.005
information, but she said they had mosquitoes 
down here and malaria and said the boys beat on you

07:58.073 --> 08:07.005
all the time and just a whole lot of stuff like that. 
And so the more she talked, the more I kind of wanted

08:08.166 --> 08:12.612
to come down here. I told her, I said, now, Mom, 
They've been telling the boys to graduate down

08:15.346 --> 08:18.069
there. And I said, if they could graduate down 
there, I can too. And I talked her into it, and I came

08:22.134 --> 08:25.117
on down here. And she was later glad I came. But she 
didn't want me to come down here. But I went into the

08:33.426 --> 08:44.779
2D high school, had a little library, not very big, 
but long about that time, about 1918, I guess 1917,

08:33.426 --> 08:44.779
they put out a little brochure or something here 
entitled 60 Facts About A&M College of Texas. And

08:51.634 --> 08:53.076
you may have it over there in the archives. Yeah, I 
have some of those. But I give mine to old Pink

08:53.917 --> 08:55.440
Bounds. And I thought maybe he put it in the 
archives. I think he did. 60 Facts About A&M

08:59.867 --> 09:03.753
College of Texas. And it had a picture of a Hereford 
cow with a halter on it. I'd never seen one of those

09:06.537 --> 09:08.520
with a halter on it. We just had range cows out 
there. And I kept reading those facts, and they

09:11.489 --> 09:15.773
were wonderful, I'll tell you. I just saw a state 
highway engineer was from A&M, and an electrical

09:17.435 --> 09:26.944
engineer who helped eliminate the Panama Canal, 
and you never saw so many things in there. And then

09:27.645 --> 09:39.977
in 1913, the sergeant and team from A&M won the 
contest at International in Chicago, and just

09:27.645 --> 09:39.977
things like that, you know. and what the graduates 
had done and all. So that impressed me very much. I

09:47.278 --> 09:56.331
believe that that would still impress high school 
students if you get out something like that and

09:47.278 --> 09:56.331
send these kids to the library. I don't know where 
it would not. Of course, when I was in 1918, that's a

09:59.376 --> 10:03.482
long time ago. Kids are a little different now than 
they was then. Well, I think they had some very

10:07.608 --> 10:10.352
elaborate brochures with colored pictures in 
them that they send out to the high school students

10:10.855 --> 10:17.504
nowadays.

10:20.469 --> 10:23.713
What were your first reactions to the school when 
you arrived? Well, the first day I spent at A&M was

10:24.775 --> 10:37.493
in the rotunda of the, I guess, what do they call 
that building on the Dome right now? Academic

10:37.653 --> 10:38.995
building. Academic building, on a cot. It didn't 
have the assignments to dormitories and things

10:41.922 --> 10:46.468
like that. And so I spent my first night on a cot in 
that

10:47.489 --> 10:57.422
rotunda of that building. And when I got up the next 
morning, they had A&M students, most of them were

10:57.442 --> 11:09.297
juniors, assigned heard these boys around and the 
various things that they had to do. And the first

11:17.473 --> 11:20.277
thing we did, of course, was go to breakfast. And I 
looked at that piece of hull, and I thought that was

11:21.659 --> 11:25.805
the biggest thing I ever saw. And my roommate, his 
daddy was a rancher. And when we got to the front

11:29.871 --> 11:34.257
door, my roommate says, look at that thing. And it 
was big dust. We were from a little old town, too. He

11:37.962 --> 11:39.925
said, wouldn't this hold a lot of hay?

11:45.372 --> 11:59.124
But I was really, really impressed with A&M 
College and we thought we had a lot of good

11:45.372 --> 11:59.124
buildings in, but man, now, I've been around here 
so long now, I'm a stranger in my own hometown. But

12:00.345 --> 12:14.637
we had, God Hall was completed that year and Bazell 
Hall was completed that year and I think Francis

12:00.345 --> 12:14.637
Hall was completed that year and So we thought Gown 
Hall was just out of this world in those days. And

12:20.249 --> 12:24.674
Brazil Hall, I lived in there three years, 
sophomore, junior, and senior. I lived in Leggett

12:24.694 --> 12:29.198
and Milner the first two years. But there were a lot 
of bedbugs here then and there. Man alive, you'd

12:34.223 --> 12:40.789
come in here after Christmas and turn on your 
light, and those bedbugs would be climbing all

12:34.223 --> 12:40.789
over everywhere. They'd give you a hard time at 
night? Yeah, man, they did. What did you do to it?

12:47.330 --> 12:56.320
Well,

12:47.330 --> 12:56.320
as soon as we'd report the bed bugs, well, they'd 
get the sulfur out and treat them, you know. And one

12:57.141 --> 13:05.130
time they sent us all to another dormitory, fish, 
sent us down to Brazel Hall so they could burn that

12:57.141 --> 13:05.130
sulfur down there. And that, I guess, got rid of a 
lot of them. Then they'd put these mattresses in a

13:08.574 --> 13:13.159
room and treat them, you know. But I liked A&M from 
the day I came and the day I left. It just suited me

13:19.767 --> 13:22.610
fine. Well, you mentioned earlier your mother 
didn't want you to go because of the story she had

13:22.630 --> 13:28.918
heard about hazing. I don't know where she heard 
all that. Did you encounter any? I didn't hear any

13:31.421 --> 13:32.323
of that. You hadn't heard any? I hadn't heard any of 
that. And it wouldn't have made much difference

13:34.906 --> 13:38.550
because I had three brothers older than I. And...

13:44.408 --> 13:46.230
They hate me all the time anyway. And for example, 
and they taught me a lot of things that hit me out

13:46.250 --> 13:51.576
down here. Like, well, my youngest brother was 
five years older than I was. When I was about 12, he

13:55.661 --> 14:02.789
was 17, and I got me a secondhand little bicycle. 
And they were playing down there about a block from

14:03.710 --> 14:08.636
where we lived, he and his buddies. And I went down 
there on my bicycle. Well, they didn't want me

14:12.185 --> 14:14.949
around because I was too young for them. So they 
asked me if I'd, they bragged on my bicycle and then

14:16.050 --> 14:20.776
asked me if I'd run them an errand. And I said, yeah. 
And they sent me down to the hardware store to get a

14:22.738 --> 14:31.289
can of wrinkles and a half a dozen knot holes.

14:31.309 --> 14:36.816
So I got on the bicycle and I went down there. 
Luckily, the owner of the outfit, Mr. Cancel, came

14:41.598 --> 14:47.083
out there about the time my dad did, and they were 
good friends, and they knew me ever since I was a

14:41.598 --> 14:47.083
baby. And he put his arm around my shoulder and 
said, well, I know what I wanted, and I told him I

14:47.103 --> 14:54.209
wanted a can of wrinkles and a half-dozen autos. He 
knew what, he said, who sent you down here? And I

14:56.351 --> 14:59.674
told him, he said, you tell those boys to come down 
here themselves and get that. He saved me, because

14:59.774 --> 15:02.536
he's supposed to send me to the next store, you 
know. So that kind of stuff was going on down here,

15:03.917 --> 15:08.021
you know. Like they'd send you to Reveille, Fluid, 
and all that kind of stuff. Sell you a ticket to take

15:12.997 --> 15:18.005
a bath and stuff like that you didn't need. Sell you 
a radiator to heat your room with. So I just got

15:23.854 --> 15:27.519
right into that stuff. I'd been trained a whole lot 
by my older brothers. So the upperclassmen were

15:30.724 --> 15:37.675
the ones who would try to sell the fish a ticket to 
take a bath and a radiator for the room and that sort

15:30.724 --> 15:37.675
of stuff. Yeah. Were they very successful with 
some of the other boys? Well, yes. And one of the

15:45.355 --> 15:58.509
main ones was to pick out some old fish that looked 
gullible and then promote it to first sergeant and

15:45.355 --> 15:58.509
pin it and stuff. And that fish, he took that 
seriously. He tried to tell these other fish

16:04.370 --> 16:06.393
softboard what to do and all that kind of stuff. 
They had a lot of fun out of those kind

16:06.453 --> 16:12.142
of boys. Somebody told me about a student who was a 
fish that was really trying hard in the military

16:12.162 --> 16:30.090
and I forget what position they promoted him to but 
they told him that he was in charge of inspecting

16:12.162 --> 16:30.090
all the vehicles that came on campus on Sunday to 
see if they were carrying any alcohol. And he

16:31.673 --> 16:33.516
stopped Dr. Brazell. Oh, he did? And some visiting 
dignitary and inspected the car. Isn't that

16:37.122 --> 16:40.488
something?

16:40.588 --> 16:43.112
That's really good. No, I sure did like him. Of 
course, everybody was in the cadet corps then, and

16:45.396 --> 16:54.451
roomed in the dormitories, and the athletes 
roomed right with them. They didn't have any

16:54.471 --> 16:56.955
athletic dormitory or anything like that. And I 
know when I was a senior, I was a major of the 1st

16:58.032 --> 17:01.917
Battalion Infantry. And I had several football 
players in the company. I had two companies, A

17:09.227 --> 17:12.191
company and B company. And Bob Carruthers, who was 
an outstanding football player, and Peony

17:12.211 --> 17:19.440
Wilson. And those were in there. And I remember one 
time, we had to have inspections, and old Peony

17:20.602 --> 17:26.790
didn't have his. the shirt, the emblem on his shirt 
that he's supposed to have. And the sergeant major

17:35.749 --> 17:41.535
was taking down these things and he'd get the 
marriage written. And I said, told him what the

17:41.555 --> 17:43.577
thing was. He said, you mean you're gonna give him 
the marriage, Peter Williams? You know, he was out

17:48.022 --> 17:49.984
signing football players. I said, sure. I said, 
Peter wouldn't like this if we didn't give him the

17:51.606 --> 17:56.271
marriage. So the world couldn't hear me. And Puny 
later thanked me for that. He says the other kid,

18:01.214 --> 18:07.483
they would have forgiven him if he'd got by that. 
But we the football players right there in the

18:07.503 --> 18:13.331
company with you, you know. Well, they did have 
different training tables where they had their

18:13.371 --> 18:20.020
own training diets and stuff like that. But 
outside of that, they slept in the dormitories

18:20.060 --> 18:23.845
with you. and the drill and all that kind of stuff. I 
presume during football season they might miss a

18:27.345 --> 18:30.808
drill now and then. Oh yeah, they relied on it then, 
yeah. But we had a class of 19, my fish year, those

18:33.011 --> 18:53.173
four years were really, we were very fortunate as 
far as that is concerned because in 1919 we won the

18:33.011 --> 18:53.173
Southwest Conference and wasn't even scored on 
and made 276 points to nothing. And we also won the

18:53.845 --> 18:58.292
basketball championship along that 19, 19, 20, 
and 21. And in 1921, we won another Southwest

18:58.392 --> 19:05.343
Conference championship. And on January the 1st, 
22, played the Praying Colonels up there at Dallas

19:05.363 --> 19:11.092
Fire and won that game. And old Peter Wilson, he 
made the first score. He recovered a fumble or

19:15.399 --> 19:20.207
something behind the goal line and made two 
points. But we really had some good athletes,

19:22.128 --> 19:31.020
successes in their athletic program when I was 
here. I believe the 17 team was the football team.

19:34.745 --> 19:35.666
17, yeah, but I wasn't here. Yeah, it was also 
unscored on. It was, yeah. And the 19 was unscored.

19:38.771 --> 19:40.893
Yeah, they made 270 points in 1917. Mm-hmm. 19, 19, 
276. In 19, 19-2, our international livestock,

19:42.656 --> 19:47.603
that team won at Chicago. Mm-hmm. So we had pretty 
good four years. Yeah, yeah. And now that 22 class

19:51.777 --> 19:56.263
really had some wonderful boys in it. Well, we've 
got three buildings on the campus named after 22

19:57.244 --> 20:01.890
graduates. The petroleum building there, Old 
Music Daugherty, and Zachary Engineering

20:01.970 --> 20:09.020
Building, he's a 22 man. Tom Harrington, 22 man. So 
we've got three out of the 22 class. We've got a

20:13.566 --> 20:15.288
building named after Peter. Yeah, I've been 
working with the Mr. Crawford in mechanical

20:19.351 --> 20:22.154
engineering. And he keeps referring to, well, I 
think particularly 22 and 32 as banner classes.

20:31.304 --> 20:35.108
So many in each of those two classes that have 
really attained prominence. They were really

20:36.069 --> 20:39.252
prominent classes. 42, I guess. They were real 
good boys. Well, that's the war class. So many of

20:45.900 --> 20:47.762
them, I guess, were killed. Yes. Well, if you go 
backwards from 22, the 12th class had some- Oh

20:49.439 --> 20:58.731
yeah, Dutch Horn was in class of 12. His boy married 
our eldest daughter.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.405
Dutch Horn, he was a character. I've read portions 
of his book, The Dutchman on the Brazos. He's the

21:14.170 --> 21:19.717
one who started selling these tickets to these 
fish that come off the train down there for 10 cents

21:14.170 --> 21:19.717
to take a bath. Didn't have to buy them, but they 
didn't know this. Now Dutch was captain of the

21:24.082 --> 21:28.407
football team and baseball team. The tickets to 
take a bath would have been for the gnat, I take it.

21:32.752 --> 21:37.418
Yeah, that's right.

21:39.642 --> 21:41.524
What was life like in the dormitory? I don't 
believe you've ever... Well, the dormitory life

21:41.624 --> 21:51.133
was designed to help the kids so they could study. 
In other words, they had to call the quarters. I

21:54.597 --> 21:56.899
forget what it was, about 7, 7.30, 7.30. And 
everything had to be quiet because the post had

21:57.559 --> 22:01.123
guards in it. And I guess that's one reason they 
built these dormitories like Leggett and Milner

22:01.143 --> 22:07.489
because you'd walk all around and they'd inspect 
every room on every floor and they had in the

22:07.942 --> 22:37.780
military they posted the guard and somebody had to 
walk post once a term and they'd put you on one of

22:07.942 --> 22:37.780
these floors and you'd go around and your job was to 
open the door at 7.30 and ask alright and if they say

22:07.942 --> 22:37.780
alright that means nobody's visiting and 
everybody's there and ought to be there and all

22:07.942 --> 22:37.780
that stuff And everything was quiet and you could 
study. And then at 10.30, I believe, or 10.45,

22:41.155 --> 22:52.667
they'd give you 15 minutes to get ready to go to bed 
and blow another bugle. They used to blow the bugle

22:53.347 --> 22:57.452
down here. And one of the blue taps was 11 o'clock, 
and he was supposed to be in bed. And then that old

23:01.075 --> 23:03.418
boy would expect again, you see. Opened the door 
and said, Say, all right, your light's supposed to

23:05.958 --> 23:10.223
be out, except for seniors. I think seniors get to 
leave their light on. What about at other times

23:14.827 --> 23:17.550
during the day? You know, there was no guard mount 
then. No, well, they had an altar of the day. But

23:25.399 --> 23:28.262
that's all. Well, of course, we had regular army 
sergeants. We had artillery and we had...

23:35.371 --> 23:43.081
Calvary, and we had Air Corps, and we had Signal 
Corps. We had a lot of division of the Army here

23:44.122 --> 23:50.450
then, and it took a lot of regular Army sergeants 
around here. We had quite a few of them. They'd been

23:51.792 --> 24:00.943
in the Army, some of them fought down there in 
Mexico in 1915, along with old Funston and

23:51.792 --> 24:00.943
Pershing and a bunch of guys. And so we had some real 
good sergeants here that During the war, they

24:05.257 --> 24:09.724
boarded the captain and they had to deal with the 
mess. Were they the ones who did the inspections of

24:09.744 --> 24:12.287
the rooms? No, the inspection of the rooms was done 
by students. Now, we had to get up and have

24:17.655 --> 24:28.050
calisthenics before breakfast when we were going 
school here. And then, while we were our records

24:34.231 --> 24:41.119
went to classes while some of the military people 
inspected our rooms. And we were supposed to have

24:41.139 --> 24:46.425
our beds made, we were supposed to have our shoes 
shined and all that. We kept rifles in our room in

24:46.466 --> 24:48.408
those days. And we were supposed to have those 
rifles cleaned and everything in place. The rooms

24:53.894 --> 24:58.720
were really nice in those days. Did you ever use the 
rifles on the rifle range or anything like that or

24:59.324 --> 25:05.434
were they just primarily for carrying around? We 
did have range practice, yeah. But they were

25:07.779 --> 25:09.962
primarily just for parades. Where was the rifle 
range? It was way back over in there, close to that

25:11.565 --> 25:16.554
fish, old fish tank. I don't know what they call it 
now. Back over there where that Fire School is

25:21.245 --> 25:23.367
somewhere in that area. Uh-huh. Well, it would be 
then across the bypass. Yes. Then behind there,

25:27.431 --> 25:30.254
east, on the other side of Eastwood Airport. Yeah.

25:35.098 --> 25:41.765
Now, we had an interurban from here to Bryan. They 
called it a lot of names. I don't know what it was.

25:43.727 --> 25:45.549
Jumping Jelly or something. Tunerville Trolley. 
Tunerville Trolley and... We had no place to go.

25:51.209 --> 25:55.995
There wasn't no such thing as going home on the 
weekend in those days. And I never saw a boy get out

25:56.055 --> 26:02.982
on the highway and tell me he was riding when I was in 
school here. That started later.

26:10.210 --> 26:13.133
You mentioned the interurban to Bryan. How 
frequently could you go to Bryan? Well, you'd have

26:18.367 --> 26:21.490
to get a pass to go to Bryan. And if you wasn't a 
campus, you'd go nearly any time you want to if you

26:22.511 --> 26:29.197
get a pass. But there wasn't anything to go to 
except pick show. And we'd do that sometimes. And

26:38.726 --> 26:46.213
then when you got to be a senior, if you were a 
captain or higher, The picture show down there

26:46.818 --> 26:52.464
would give you a pass to the show all year long. And 
so that was one thing they did for us over in Bryan.

27:00.131 --> 27:02.454
How much did it cost you to ride the trolley to 
Bryan? 10 cents. 10 cents.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.523
Let's see. We've talked a little bit about the mess 
hall. And you mentioned that your roommate, who

27:13.265 --> 27:15.627
was also West Texas thought it would hold a lot of 
hay.

27:21.813 --> 27:23.375
I had to agree with you on that. Yeah, it'd hold even 
more today. What was the food like there? Well, we

27:29.262 --> 27:30.163
thought it was good. Now, every now and then you'd 
hear a lot of complaints. And Dr. Brazell was

27:33.948 --> 27:35.429
president. He was president of the CIA before he 
came down here. Of course, some of these guys at the

27:40.155 --> 27:44.280
CIA don't like to be called that anymore. makes 
some of them mad. Texas University for Women, I

27:47.347 --> 27:49.931
believe, what they call it now. Anyway, Dr. Zell 
was fed up there and he came down here in 1914. And

27:55.497 --> 28:05.830
he'd hear these complaints about food and so one 
time he had us all down there in Guyon Hall and those

27:55.497 --> 28:05.830
days he'd put everybody in Guyon Hall. And he had 
mentioned that and he said now, you ought to check

28:12.188 --> 28:15.193
up a little bit on that and see if you don't weigh 
more than that. And you did when you came down here,

28:15.213 --> 28:17.917
and usually you would, you know. But I thought they 
fed us pretty good. And they put a pitcher of milk

28:20.982 --> 28:23.826
that big on everything. If you wanted milk, just 
pour you a glass full, and if you run out, pour

28:23.846 --> 28:28.714
another one. And you had enough to eat.

28:33.261 --> 28:35.544
Some of them might not have liked it, but I thought 
it was good. They had pancakes and eggs and bacon

28:35.565 --> 28:38.449
for breakfast. and syrup and stuff like that, and 
they had cereal. I don't see how they could beat

28:42.868 --> 28:44.169
that. And sometimes they passed out apples and you 
could take them home with you or back to your

28:45.471 --> 28:53.858
dormitory.

28:53.878 --> 28:56.961
Yeah, some complaints, but I thought it was pretty 
good. Well, I imagine there will always be some

28:57.581 --> 29:01.245
people who would complain no matter what you feel. 
Yeah. But what did the... We had to learn all these

29:01.805 --> 29:08.411
names, us fish did, you know. Uh-huh. You mean the 
special names for the food? Yeah. If you didn't ask

29:12.079 --> 29:14.242
for it by the right name, you didn't get anything. 
That's right. They call molasses a regulator.

29:19.169 --> 29:19.910
Coffee dope.

29:22.614 --> 29:28.201
I guess that's because of the drug it has in it. 
Mm-hmm. Caffeine. Caffeine.

29:32.447 --> 29:32.588
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. They named them pretty good. Yes. 
Pepper was black. It was dirt. Dirt. Sugar.

29:43.515 --> 29:44.356
Sand, I believe. No, salt was sand, I believe. I 
forget what sugar was.

29:50.686 --> 29:51.748
Bread was gunwale. Pie was cush. We never got much. 
That's one thing that softball would take away

29:56.475 --> 30:06.570
from us sometimes, particularly if it catches us 
doing something we ought to be, we shouldn't be

29:56.475 --> 30:06.570
doing. And then they'd really take the coach away 
from us for a week. Well, it was all kind of home

30:11.474 --> 30:13.477
style. Oh, yeah. Family style. You see, each 
company would be assigned a table, you know, and

30:17.624 --> 30:24.114
the same table every time. So when they march you up 
the steps and turn you loose, you know where to go.

30:28.781 --> 30:32.787
And you'd get all the food you wanted to eat. They 
never did. Did the upperclassmen ever play any,

30:35.221 --> 30:47.516
well, I'll say play games about the food other than 
taking away your kush? Well, once in a while you'd

30:47.536 --> 31:01.093
hear something like that where they'd add 
something to it, like I'd put some vinegar on

30:47.536 --> 31:01.093
something to make it taste pretty good or 
something like that, but not very often. One, I've

31:01.529 --> 31:09.690
heard mention of occasional prune races in the 
mess hall. Did you ever experience any of those?

31:11.515 --> 31:12.237
No, I didn't. No? Okay. I think some of those 
things...
