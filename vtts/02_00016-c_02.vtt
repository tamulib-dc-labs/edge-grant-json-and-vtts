00:02.562 --> 00:04.624
Maybe, maybe not.

00:07.306 --> 00:23.622
But that I'm not one of the Aggies who bleeds maroon, nor am I an Aggie that is embarrassed when someone pokes fun at us because I know they only poke fun out of jealousy or envy.

00:25.804 --> 00:29.447
And I would not exchange, given a choice, to be 18 years old again.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.382
I would tell you I made the right choice.

00:35.625 --> 00:41.012
Have we left out some important topics?

00:41.032 --> 00:53.909
I did not prepare to come to this, short of when I got in my vehicle to drive over here, thinking two or three thoughts, two or three of the stories that I've told this afternoon.

00:54.129 --> 00:55.872
Have we included all the stories you thought of?

00:56.573 --> 00:58.455
Well, let me tell you one more.

00:59.617 --> 01:02.140
And you can confirm this.

01:04.802 --> 01:15.633
When the POWs were released, that I called James Ray, and he remembered me.

01:17.515 --> 01:23.381
And he was at San Antonio, as I recall, or ended up at San Antonio in the hospital there, or they kept him there for a period of time.

01:24.542 --> 01:27.345
And I invited him to come back

01:28.051 --> 01:34.862
that I had tickets, would he come and go to the first football game of the season with me?

01:35.563 --> 01:36.184
And he agreed.

01:38.868 --> 01:41.232
And he came and we visited one with another.

01:41.252 --> 01:47.562
And when we went to the ball game, and I'm a great football fan, that there we played Wichita State.

01:49.567 --> 01:58.179
And as the kickoff was just moments away, I said, man, I have really waited to see this game.

02:00.502 --> 02:15.422
And he said, so have I. And probably in my mind, that tells the story of what an Aggie is all about.

02:15.959 --> 02:17.504
What a splendid example.

02:17.604 --> 02:18.768
What a splendid example.

02:20.613 --> 02:25.328
Well, if you think of other topics, we can do it again.

02:27.873 --> 02:29.977
I've got three other things to mention.

02:30.198 --> 02:47.874
One is if you ever have any Aggie memorabilia, papers, tickets, programs that you saved or anything that you are going to dispose of, I beg you please send them to the A&M Archives.

02:48.515 --> 02:48.615
Okay.

02:48.595 --> 02:48.955
Done.

02:51.258 --> 03:05.531
Then the next to last one is, what if someone comes up to you today and said, here is a check for a million dollars and there's only one condition, you must give it to Texas A&M, but you get to tell them what they should do with it.

03:06.572 --> 03:13.219
If you had a million dollars you could give to A&M, what would you ask them to do with it?

03:13.239 --> 03:16.442
What good do you wish you could do for A&M today if you had the money?

03:20.050 --> 03:27.159
I think in this life that A&M has values and tradition that I will carry to the grave.

03:29.462 --> 03:45.282
But I would ask that it would be, they would use that million dollars to endow or to establish someplace where people with a Christian faith could be studied so that we could take these values with us to heaven.

03:48.316 --> 03:49.117
Last question.

03:49.838 --> 03:57.325
What feelings do you have in your heart for Texas A&M now?

03:57.345 --> 03:58.867
Again, let me end with a story.

03:59.547 --> 04:05.053
If I had a little brother and you were picking on him, I would come and kick your butt.

04:08.576 --> 04:13.341
And I'm going to whip up on him every chance that I get, but he's still my little brother.

04:13.361 --> 04:14.222
And while

04:15.248 --> 04:17.271
A&M has grown beyond anything.

04:17.331 --> 04:23.501
It is a stranger to me in terms of I'm intimidated by trying to find a parking place here.

04:23.521 --> 04:31.333
I could not at any time in my life do well enough on the SAT that I could get into A&M today.

04:33.406 --> 04:46.707
While I'm immensely proud of it at times and infuriated at it at other times, that I made the right decision by being an Aggie.
