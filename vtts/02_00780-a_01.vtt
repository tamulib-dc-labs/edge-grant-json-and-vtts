00:01.887 --> 00:08.376
This is Deborah Beale, and I am interviewing Dr. W. 
Arthur Porter on the history of Texas Engineering

00:01.887 --> 00:08.376
Experiment Station. The date is June 8th, 1984.

00:15.326 --> 00:24.879
What I'd like to start with is just a brief 
biographical sketch of you and how you came to be

00:15.326 --> 00:24.879
associated with A&M and Peace. Oh, okay. Brief or 
long, whatever you want to make it. Uh...

00:32.077 --> 00:56.907
My association

00:32.077 --> 00:56.907
with A&M began in 1968 as an assistant professor of 
local engineering coming here from the

00:32.077 --> 00:56.907
semiconductor and R&D labs in Texas. And you had a 
degree in electrical engineering? No, I had

00:57.929 --> 01:01.493
degrees in physics, a bachelor's and a master's 
from North Texas, which I got

01:06.890 --> 01:10.614
63 and 64 maybe. I have to check the masters. I think 
the masters were 64. Then I came

01:15.220 --> 01:28.956
to Texas

01:15.220 --> 01:28.956
A&M

01:15.220 --> 01:28.956
for a Ph.D. in physics in 64. I finished the 
coursework for my Ph.D. in physics in 66. In those

01:32.741 --> 01:34.483
two years from 64 to 66 when I taught as an 
instructor in both the physics and math

01:36.083 --> 02:00.294
departments

01:36.083 --> 02:00.294
during those two years, decided

01:36.083 --> 02:00.294
that I had been in the educational mode the moment I 
left Texas A&M. I went to Texas A&M. R&D lab. Now,

02:01.075 --> 02:03.058
the bio that I saw, you said you had the PhD in 
interdisciplinary engineering. Correct. What

02:03.258 --> 02:04.099
is that? That's

02:05.429 --> 02:19.310
a degree that's not used very often here at A&M, but 
it has been on the books. And there is not a

02:21.393 --> 02:25.179
department of engineering here. The department 
head rotates.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.943
without any periodicity. I think it's random.

02:37.049 --> 02:41.956
From various departments.

02:41.976 --> 02:47.583
I don't know how many degrees of 
interdisciplinary engineering have been given

02:41.976 --> 02:47.583
at Texas A&M. It would be interesting to know that. 
It's in the catalog. It's an option. But it's

02:55.254 --> 02:59.500
usually reserved for someone who has had

03:00.712 --> 03:04.937
I think my situation was a good example. I had 
completed the coursework for a Ph.D. in physics. I

03:07.880 --> 03:11.904
had spent two years in a major industrial research 
laboratory. I had a very specific dissertation

03:11.924 --> 03:21.194
research project that I was interested in doing. 
And the coursework built around that discipline

03:21.214 --> 03:28.862
was very interdisciplinary. It required an 
understanding of the basic laws of Mother Nature

03:29.197 --> 03:39.271
from the physical sense, which I had already done 
in my PhD work in physics. It also demanded an

03:39.291 --> 03:54.833
understanding of the applications of those laws 
in several different areas of engineering, in

03:39.291 --> 03:54.833
electrical, chemical,

03:39.291 --> 03:54.833
materials.

03:57.479 --> 04:15.782
So in 68, when I returned, when I really came to 
Texas A&M as a professor for the first time, having

03:57.479 --> 04:15.782
been a graduate student for two years before, I 
defined what I wanted to do to finish my PhD. And it

04:15.802 --> 04:24.332
was suggested that what I needed to do was to do the 
interdisciplinary

04:15.802 --> 04:24.332
engineering degree. I looked at it. It sounded 
reasonable to me. So I did it. That I finished in

04:28.428 --> 04:30.851
1970. So really all I did was build on the 
experiences, educational experiences in

04:30.891 --> 04:58.165
physics by adding courses in electrical 
engineering at the Ph.D. level,

04:30.891 --> 04:58.165
mechanics and materials, in chemical 
engineering and gas dynamics,

04:59.005 --> 05:04.533
did what we might otherwise call a Ph.D. and a half 
or two Ph.D.s at a court work. And then did my

05:06.876 --> 05:08.178
dissertation. And all of that time I was serving as 
an assistant

05:08.478 --> 05:16.049
professor. And the association that you used to 
associate as a researcher at that time? Sure. The

05:21.296 --> 05:25.722
research course at that time, that was in 68 to 70, 
The electrical engineering department, which

05:26.039 --> 05:42.240
also served as a division of teams, had very little 
research and was trying to build its first

05:26.039 --> 05:42.240
microelectronics program. I believe that was 
what I was recruited from TI to do. The question I

05:48.228 --> 05:50.511
was asked, I remember it well, And even how I came to 
come back was I was here at A&M on campus recruiting

05:50.913 --> 05:59.689
North Texas instructors. When I was asked to come 
over to the electrical engineering department to

05:59.709 --> 06:15.317
meet with some of the professors to advise them on 
how to spend $50,000 of TEAS money they had been

05:59.709 --> 06:15.317
given to start a microelectronics research 
group. And so I met with him one afternoon, an

06:17.153 --> 06:23.862
afternoon when the interviewing was slow. And 
that evening, the head of the department, Bill

06:23.882 --> 06:35.156
Jones, asked me if I would consider coming as a 
member of the faculty, which I turned down. And it

06:35.176 --> 06:43.026
was about three or four months later, after he 
continued to contact me about would you do this or

06:35.176 --> 06:43.026
would you do that, and kept saying, would you come 
and join us? But I finally decided that if I was

06:46.389 --> 06:55.781
going to finish my Ph.D., that would be about as 
optimal a way as I was going to run into it. I was

06:55.801 --> 07:03.070
working on it, still in physics, at night at North 
Texas State. And I'm trying to do that for

07:03.090 --> 07:08.357
Dallas. It's tough. So...

07:12.102 --> 07:13.283
It was... June of 68, I decided to leave TI. I took a 
leave. I just took a leave. You were just going to

07:23.261 --> 07:26.726
set it up and go back? I was just going to set it up, 
finish my PhD, and go back

07:26.746 --> 07:33.475
to TI. And then in 70, when I finished my PhD and we 
had the lab set up, I had written a proposal to NASA

07:33.495 --> 07:42.747
for a research conference. which almost 
coincided with the granting of my degree. The very

07:50.063 --> 07:57.772
first research contract in electrical 
engineering was awarded to me. Here at A&M? From

07:59.313 --> 08:01.716
NASA. And so then I was faced with the decision of 
whether to stay at A&M.

08:11.549 --> 08:14.093
Was there a research contract that was awarded to 
you? Yes. So it couldn't be passed on? That's

08:16.316 --> 08:17.057
right. I had written the proposal. This was to the 
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,

08:18.880 --> 08:27.252
Alabama.

08:27.272 --> 08:36.125
Looking at the potential advantages.

08:36.145 --> 08:39.210
There were two thrusts of the contract, as I recall 
it. One was to try to establish concretely the

08:40.051 --> 08:57.860
effects of processing these defects, those 
defects that are induced during the process of

08:40.051 --> 08:57.860
building an integrated circuit, or the yield and 
reliability of the circuit. And my dissertation,

08:57.880 --> 09:05.653
what I had gotten interested in at Temple Central 
was a technique for controlling, preventing, And

09:05.988 --> 09:20.102
then the potential advantages of going to space to 
build the semiconductor integrated circuit

09:05.988 --> 09:20.102
devices to avoid those effects. So that's kind of 
the two career paths we crossed. There was an

09:27.389 --> 09:35.016
intersection at the time of my graduation, 
completion of my Ph.D. The NASA contract was

09:35.553 --> 09:37.938
awarded. The option to go back to Texas estimates 
was there. And Texas A&M was saying, don't go. So

09:48.338 --> 09:58.017
all of that was,

09:48.338 --> 09:58.017
it turned out to be an economically down The

09:58.925 --> 10:20.610
final decision was TI asked me to stay on leave if I 
wasn't going to return.

10:20.630 --> 10:25.475
As long as I was staying at Texas A&M, TI was 
satisfied. Fred Busey had called me He was then the

10:28.372 --> 10:36.566
vice president of TI, in charge of the Civic Energy 
Division. He said, do me one favor, if you leave

10:36.586 --> 10:47.544
Texas A&M, do not take another industrial job 
without letting me know

10:36.586 --> 10:47.544
about it. But as long as I was willing to stay at A&M, 
and work on the national research contract and

10:50.377 --> 10:57.105
continue to build the research program here. They 
were quite comfortable with me staying on leave

10:58.367 --> 11:05.595
from PI and staying at A&M. And that's ultimately 
what I did. And I stayed on leave from PI until

11:08.839 --> 11:15.507
somewhere in the mid-70s when I finally decided I 
wasn't going to go back. So you were the first

11:17.039 --> 11:22.868
director of the Institute of Solid State? No. How 
did that get set up? There were five or six of us in

11:24.731 --> 11:40.314
electrical engineering that loosely formed what 
you'd have to call the solid state

11:24.731 --> 11:40.314
microelectronics group, or faculty. The 
decision was made in the department that if we had

11:40.334 --> 11:45.983
an institute, a formal institute, 
administratively structured that the

11:47.110 --> 12:04.550
visibility that we would present to the outside 
world would be better and that we could compete

11:47.110 --> 12:04.550
more effectively for research contracts and 
graduate students

11:47.110 --> 12:04.550
and so forth. So the decision was made, Boolean 
Tees, with Bill Jones, who was head of the

12:04.570 --> 12:15.463
department in the division of Tees, to create the 
institute.

12:17.688 --> 12:31.810
And that was made,

12:17.688 --> 12:31.810
I believe, prior to even my

12:17.688 --> 12:31.810
completion. I'm not sure. Very, very close to the 
time. I've had to look at it. At the time, it seemed

12:33.212 --> 12:39.241
just exactly what was written. But Roman Hayden 
was the first director of ISSE, of the Institute

12:39.261 --> 12:43.307
for Solid State Electronics. And he served as the 
director until I took over. And I don't even

12:49.978 --> 12:50.999
remember. 72. 72? Okay. So the Institute, the 
Solid State Institute, or the Institute for Solid

12:53.782 --> 13:01.551
State Electronics, was probably created about 
70. I'm guessing. You may know that or not. Yeah.

13:09.641 --> 13:11.623
We enrolled and took the... When he left Texas A&M 
to become the chairman of the W department, I think

13:12.734 --> 13:22.888
at Oklahoma, he now serves as the dean of 
engineering at Arizona State. I don't know where

13:22.908 --> 13:24.651
he is now. I'm not sure where he went, but he left. 
And I was asked to take over the directorship of the

13:28.196 --> 13:36.267
Institute for Scholarly Studies at Clarkson. I 
was the second director. Did that take much of the

13:37.268 --> 13:40.012
administrative work? Initially,

13:44.948 --> 13:47.770
Well, nothing like this job. We were about five 
faculty members. Probably no more than five

13:53.275 --> 14:02.763
graduate

13:53.275 --> 14:02.763
students. Maybe 10, but I don't believe there were 
any at the PhD level. All at the master's level.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.433
Might have been one in there somewhere at the PhD 
level. But very small. So the administrative work

14:17.551 --> 14:31.392
that it took on my part was just trying to structure 
and define and give visibility to an entity that

14:17.551 --> 14:31.392
was a mental creation that was in the process of 
being physically structured. But see, we were

14:32.334 --> 14:36.981
still putting all this together over an old bolted 
wall. We were trying to build out of two-by-fours

14:37.001 --> 14:44.352
and sheet-like, what you'd call a high-tech 
research object. When

14:46.795 --> 14:51.323
did you get out of there? When the Zachary 
Engineering Center was completed, we moved from

14:51.503 --> 15:00.599
Baltimore to Zachary. And I think Zachary must be 
about 12 years old now. That would

15:04.686 --> 15:10.135
have been about 70. No, Zachary must not be. He must 
have been. 74 or somewhere like that. Yeah, well,

15:14.718 --> 15:25.425
whatever that is, when we moved and we had 
designed, been able to design into Zachary,

15:14.718 --> 15:25.425
really some first class facilities. Is that the 
way Zachary was constructed, or was every

15:26.013 --> 15:31.102
department and institute got to design its own? 
Well, not every, but all of those that were in

15:31.122 --> 15:33.967
there. I think there were five. But I mean, all the 
ones that were going to move in got to design their

15:35.149 --> 15:39.617
own? That's right. So it wasn't an outside effort 
to... No, that's right. As a matter of fact,

15:48.203 --> 16:07.307
The person who really designed the facility,

15:48.203 --> 16:07.307
the institute, was Robert Hayden. He was the 
interface person. Did your involvement with TEAS

16:13.054 --> 16:13.815
change? I know it did change between 72 and 79. 
Well,

16:15.203 --> 16:40.553
as ISSE

16:15.203 --> 16:40.553
grew, the amount

16:15.203 --> 16:40.553
of administrative work, we were, at the time, I was 
asked to come in to tease. to become the director of

16:41.326 --> 16:45.652
TV. That was in, actually it

16:45.672 --> 16:53.003
was in August of 79. Yeah. Okay, so as director or as 
assistant director? Well, I was asked to come as

16:54.085 --> 17:09.628
the director, but the evolution of that was to be 
the assistant director for a few months, and then

16:54.085 --> 17:09.628
in the spring of 80, take over as director. But to 
serve as the assistant director,

17:17.366 --> 17:28.426
find where the restroom is and kind of get your feet 
on the ground for a few months and then become the

17:17.366 --> 17:28.426
director. And that proposal was made to me. 
Actually

17:32.744 --> 17:44.919
in August of 1979.

17:44.939 --> 17:50.806
I

17:44.939 --> 17:50.806
remember it well because I was just about to leave 
on a trip to the PNC. There were eight or ten of us

17:50.826 --> 18:01.419
local engineers from around the nation who had 
been invited by China to come and give lectures

17:50.826 --> 18:01.419
throughout the country. We were going to spend 
about a month And about two weeks before I was to

18:03.642 --> 18:24.523
leave, I was called out by the dean of the College of 
Engineering and director of TEJ,

18:03.642 --> 18:24.523
Fred Benson, and presented with his proposal. So 
did you get to go to the PRC? Oh, sure. Okay. They

18:25.864 --> 18:27.726
didn't make you? But I was asked to make my mind up. 
or whether or not I would accept the position so

18:29.917 --> 18:42.454
that it would become effective

18:29.917 --> 18:42.454
on the 1st of September. Which really gave me 
something like two weeks. It was somewhere around

18:44.016 --> 18:47.380
the middle of August. So this wasn't a job you did or 
made or got after this was just passed up? No, and it

18:50.264 --> 18:52.988
came completely off the wall to me. It was the 
second time I arrived in approach to the Indian

18:53.508 --> 19:01.977
system to take on a major administrative

18:53.508 --> 19:01.977
responsibility. What was the position? As 
president of the Research Foundation, which

19:03.018 --> 19:11.787
had...

19:03.018 --> 19:11.787
Wasn't he, didn't Benson have that position then? 
He may have had that position then, too. But when J.

19:14.510 --> 19:21.878
Llewellyn, Dr. Llewellyn, had left as the 
president of the Research Foundation, I

19:23.073 --> 19:43.164
was

19:23.073 --> 19:43.164
approached to take over that position. And I had 
turned that day home. And so, after Intensive

19:45.314 --> 20:13.482
meetings

19:45.314 --> 20:13.482
with the president

19:45.314 --> 20:13.482
of the university, who was at that time George 
Miller, and the new dean of engineering, who at

19:45.314 --> 20:13.482
that time was Bob Page, to get their sense of 
whether or not it was the right move for me to leave

19:45.314 --> 20:13.482
the directorship of this union. take

20:14.423 --> 20:33.724
on the Directorship of Tees,

20:14.423 --> 20:33.724
Vis-a-Vis, coming in as Assistant Director for a 
few months and then going into the Directorship.

20:33.744 --> 20:34.746
With their encouragement to do it, I agreed to it. 
And then I went to China. Did you, was your

20:37.087 --> 20:48.867
experience before then limited to ISSE or had you 
gotten into any of the other TEAS programs and

20:37.087 --> 20:48.867
research groups? Oh, at that time, of course by 
that time ISSE had grown into a much more

20:48.887 --> 21:03.111
substantive and definable research entity, 
which was taken considerable amount of my time. As

21:03.918 --> 21:13.571
a matter of fact, it was to the point where I had 
really very little time to spend in the laboratory

21:03.918 --> 21:13.571
myself. I sat right next to it. Graduate students 
were essentially the hands and legs of the work in

21:17.436 --> 21:27.150
the laboratory. But that change was pretty 
dramatic. When was it, 72, did you say? From 72 to

21:33.888 --> 21:51.830
79, that seven-year period,

21:33.888 --> 21:51.830
a lot of the

21:33.888 --> 21:51.830
nuts and bolts of literally installing the 
equipment, I had done myself. And many, many of the

21:52.210 --> 22:00.520
measurements, the experiments, not just their 
design and the strategy of how to carry them out and

21:52.210 --> 22:00.520
the analysis of the results, but the actual 
carrying out of the experiments I had done myself.

22:05.980 --> 22:10.589
Because we were building for nothing. No space, no 
facilities, no equipment, no students. As they

22:17.142 --> 22:19.487
say, no nothing. And so it was...

22:24.327 --> 22:37.508
tracking from 68 particularly to 70, that 11 year 
period, we had come from, and starting with me, how

22:24.327 --> 22:37.508
would you spend $50,000 to get started if you had 
it? Was it $50,000 in Teesman or was it Grant? No,

22:40.012 --> 22:40.733
Teesman. But Tease had put $50,000, but sitting 
here today talking about that is a joke. It's

22:50.012 --> 22:50.733
funny. At the time, in 1968, for $50,000, you could 
buy a respectable amount of equipment, which we

22:51.274 --> 23:02.410
did, enough to get started. Well, we bought, I 
think, four furnaces. a very fine microscope

23:07.443 --> 23:19.758
and the basic photolithographic equipment to 
have a dark room. You could buy one furnace

23:19.778 --> 23:28.608
today for $50,000.

23:28.629 --> 23:33.915
The laboratory over there is worth probably well 
in excess of $5 million.

23:33.935 --> 23:35.657
It may be more than that. It's probably closer to 
$10,000 to $20,000. There are two laser systems

23:36.957 --> 23:48.995
over

23:36.957 --> 23:48.995
there that are worth half a million dollars each. 
Is it

23:49.015 --> 23:54.243
ever an interdisciplinary program? It was 
confined. Its target was to support the research

23:55.926 --> 24:02.155
and graduate education. in the microelectronics 
area and we had selected the engineering

24:03.080 --> 24:29.492
from a search point associated with the actual 
fabrication manufacturing of the integrated

24:03.080 --> 24:29.492
circuit so really it was the device physics and so 
we were had built a strong group associated with

24:03.080 --> 24:29.492
the the really front end part of the process as 
opposed to the circuit design part of the process.

24:35.919 --> 24:51.025
And that was a conscious decision because the 
major universities that had to jump on Texas A&M,

24:35.919 --> 24:51.025
places like Stanford, Cal Berkeley, had already 
staked out a pretty substantial claim in the

24:51.308 --> 25:15.039
circuit design, but there wasn't any university 
really targeting

24:51.308 --> 25:15.039
its efforts on studying the device physics 
aspects associated

24:51.308 --> 25:15.039
with building the head-right circuit. So that's 
where we focused our attention. Is there any work

25:16.060 --> 25:17.722
done with the remote sensing center, or is that 
fairly different? The remote sensing center was

25:17.742 --> 25:20.826
leaked also to the electrical engineering 
division. And because of the natural colleague

25:25.708 --> 25:43.173
relationship, the head of the remote sensing 
center was John Rouse, who, as a matter of fact,

25:25.708 --> 25:43.173
came to Texas A&M at the same time I did, in 1968. 
He's now the dean of engineering at UT Arlington

25:43.193 --> 25:50.644
and serving as head of the division of T's, as a 
matter of fact. So

25:51.080 --> 26:01.175
we had regular communication just because we were 
professors in the same department. And we would

26:01.195 --> 26:12.531
work jointly on research projects where the 
expertise of ISSE and the remote sensing center

26:01.195 --> 26:12.531
could be combined. So in that sense, I think all of 
our research programs here are

26:12.865 --> 26:18.603
interdisciplinary in nature. We work with the 
physics department, with the chemistry

26:18.623 --> 26:24.141
department, regularly. When our resources, our 
capabilities, our facilities could supply a need

26:24.492 --> 26:36.786
or satisfy a need, we always were open. We worked 
with the nuclear engineering, still do. ISI has a

26:40.010 --> 26:51.343
number of interrelationships, 
interdisciplinary activities where it is

26:40.010 --> 26:51.343
supportive of other programs and other programs 
support itself. Did that flexibility

26:51.880 --> 26:58.348
ever change when the administrative changes, 
either as Chancellor or President? No, I don't

26:58.368 --> 26:59.850
think so. That flexibility,

26:59.870 --> 27:07.279
the flexibility to do it? No, because it's a 
program in the Engineering Interim Station, and

27:07.299 --> 27:20.335
the Engineering Interim Station is kind of a 
melting pot of interdisciplinary activities. I

27:22.913 --> 27:35.613
don't think that there's never been a 
disincentive from the engineering

27:22.913 --> 27:35.613
experiment station's point of view. No,

27:35.633 --> 27:51.537
I don't believe there's ever been any 
administrator that I've known at least or that

27:35.633 --> 27:51.537
I've known if he's had or she that desire. It's not 
been evident to me. The strength, in my opinion,

27:56.172 --> 28:14.678
and I think this is shared by all of us in higher 
education, what happens, although none of us

27:56.172 --> 28:14.678
understand it, but what happens in a university 
atmosphere and a university campus comes from

27:56.172 --> 28:14.678
getting out of people's way and letting creative 
minds work together. And if you start trying to

28:15.359 --> 28:19.465
edict a person in a narrow otherwise narrowly 
defined discipline can never go over and interact

28:19.748 --> 28:46.482
with a person in a different but narrowly defined 
discipline i think that would be suicide to what i

28:19.748 --> 28:46.482
think happens in an academic but no one's ever 
tried it it has been tried at other places no one's

28:19.748 --> 28:46.482
no no no one's come in and tried to mark up the works i 
wouldn't say that i i won't say that All I can say is

28:46.968 --> 28:51.533
that I don't know of anybody who consciously tried 
to do that. Now,

28:51.773 --> 29:15.540
anytime you reorganize a place, and this place 
does it regularly, I think it's constantly

28:51.773 --> 29:15.540
undergoing re-organization,

28:51.773 --> 29:15.540
the desire on almost all of our hearts to, what I 
would say, control your own destiny,

29:18.743 --> 29:47.451
Most of us, particularly in higher education, we 
are in higher education in a collection of big

29:18.743 --> 29:47.451
egos, generally talented people, bright people 
who have a desire to make a contribution and hence a

29:18.743 --> 29:47.451
desire to make their own contribution and have 
that recognized. And that's the ego part. And

29:49.880 --> 29:55.245
that's very desirable, I think. So to the extent 
that any kind of administrative structure is

29:55.265 --> 30:14.586
perceived, whether it is in point of fact or not, or 
might have been, or might have worked, if given the

29:55.265 --> 30:14.586
chance, If it is perceived by an individual to 
interfere with that person's, much less entity of

30:15.089 --> 30:44.252
a department or an institute or a division, 
ability or right to control their own destiny,

30:15.089 --> 30:44.252
then that perception will

30:15.089 --> 30:44.252
cause problems. come to rest at the 
administration's

30:45.160 --> 30:49.875
doorstep. Has there been any particularly 
low-part point in the peace history since you've

30:49.895 --> 30:56.757
been involved with it? Oh,

30:57.783 --> 31:05.191
yes, absolutely. Well, I don't say that they had to 
turn around and evaluate themselves, but between

31:05.932 --> 31:25.292
the time I agreed to become the director of TEES in 
late August of 79,

31:05.932 --> 31:25.292
and at that time, The system organization 
structure was, TEAS was reporting to the

31:25.762 --> 31:38.023
president of Texas A&M University. Fred Benson 
was the vice president for engineering and

31:38.043 --> 31:47.699
non-renewable resources,

31:38.043 --> 31:47.699
if I recall the time. And TEAS reported to the 
president through that vice president.

31:53.825 --> 31:59.552
I was gone for a little over a month actually. I was 
given a paper in a conference in Germany.

32:04.757 --> 32:13.387
At any rate, by the time I got back from China,

32:04.757 --> 32:13.387
the reorganization of the system was underway. 
Unknown to me. And I found myself in the mode of

32:23.373 --> 32:47.457
having been, quote, ordained the director to be of 
needs of a part of the system that was finding

32:23.373 --> 32:47.457
itself now

32:23.373 --> 32:47.457
structured differently in the AM system than

32:23.373 --> 32:47.457
it was. I had no... way, really, to judge what that 
meant, what it might mean, or what it might be

32:50.035 --> 32:57.625
perceived to mean. But it was a very traumatic 
period for the system. All I had to do was be a casual

33:02.572 --> 33:04.935
observer. And so, I would say the whole period of my 
directorship has been rather interesting, from

33:06.998 --> 33:18.574
this administrative organization, or 
reorganization, and the perception

33:19.448 --> 33:27.196
of what that means.

33:27.256 --> 33:30.039
How does it turn out to be perceived? It depends 
upon the eyes of the holder. It's like a painting.

33:36.025 --> 33:48.477
My personal philosophy is that you can draw lines 
on paper and say this office reports to this office

33:36.025 --> 33:48.477
and this office interacts with this office And 
about the best you can do with all of that is make it

33:49.182 --> 33:55.289
difficult for it to work. But if you've got people 
with common objectives, you cannot structure

33:55.309 --> 34:04.440
a place. You'd have to work so hard, consciously, 
to destroy it, to overcome the desire and will of

34:04.460 --> 34:16.294
those people, regardless of where you placed them 
and how you drew the lines. They're going to get the

34:16.314 --> 34:17.535
job done. I do think you can organize a place, 
however, to

34:20.300 --> 34:37.488
simplify

34:20.300 --> 34:37.488
how those good people can get the job done. But it's 
virtually impossible if you really have good,

34:37.508 --> 34:43.017
dedicated people with common values to start 
with. So is the TEAS reorganization a part of the

34:45.730 --> 34:54.859
whole system reorganization that took place? 
Yes, that's right. So you were going through the

34:55.820 --> 34:57.822
same threads everyone else was going through? Oh, 
you bet. And I really had no idea personally what

34:58.322 --> 35:05.249
all that meant. What was clear, it was resisted by 
the university, Texas A&M University, did not

35:05.269 --> 35:14.758
want to see the engineering experiment station 
moved out from under the chain of command of the

35:15.329 --> 35:24.900
university.

35:26.161 --> 35:34.370
It was the will of the board to have the system 
reorganized. And the details of why, I have no

35:34.390 --> 35:37.233
idea. Nobody asked me. As a matter of fact, the 
decision was made while I was out of the country.

35:44.472 --> 36:01.135
And I frankly didn't know on a personal basis what 
it might mean or be perceived as I came back and was

35:44.472 --> 36:01.135
told that this reorganization was imminent and in 
process.

36:01.355 --> 36:08.665
Of course, it's a matter of history what

36:01.355 --> 36:08.665
happened. And I just,

36:12.805 --> 36:35.166
Having made the mill commitment and

36:12.805 --> 36:35.166
the professional commitment to try to grab hold of 
the range of keys and try to build a research

36:12.805 --> 36:35.166
property

36:12.805 --> 36:35.166
that would make a difference for this state. 
Decided to hang on to the range and see if I could

36:35.186 --> 36:39.910
keep the wagon between the ditches. But there were 
some clear ditches and some big potholes. You

36:44.876 --> 36:47.279
know, I'd turn a curve and see if there would be one. 
I hadn't had a slightest idea it was going to be

36:47.339 --> 36:50.383
there or why it was there. It would be a good shot. 
Yeah, yeah. Was the period when you acted as vice

36:53.387 --> 36:57.712
director, was that helpful to you? Sure, 
absolutely. And absolutely necessary. It's

37:00.936 --> 37:09.087
a complex... growing organization that's a now 
because of the pressures on the state part of it was

37:09.961 --> 37:39.478
at that time part of a very complex and rapidly 
growing system of critical importance to this

37:09.961 --> 37:39.478
thing this land grant university system in

37:09.961 --> 37:39.478
my opinion is and should be the brightest star

37:40.235 --> 37:47.743
in the crown of Texas. Was this during the Texas 
2000 Commission? Well, no, not at that time. That

37:54.491 --> 38:06.985
happened during

37:54.491 --> 38:06.985
Governor Clements' period as governor.

38:07.910 --> 38:19.045
But that did happen and did come to a final form 
during the period while I've been the director of

38:07.910 --> 38:19.045
teams, and I got very actively involved in that. 
Did the original findings of the commission shock

38:19.065 --> 38:29.300
teams as to how little it was actually known about 
it? Well, it didn't shock teams, I would think. One

38:34.994 --> 38:53.039
of the things I

38:34.994 --> 38:53.039
was told

38:34.994 --> 38:53.039
and encouraged to do as the time gets past and 
something like this, usually the guy who had run it

38:34.994 --> 38:53.039
will drop a pearl or two for the guy who's taking it 
over. But I was encouraged that all of us at the time

38:53.059 --> 39:01.491
to try to make these more visible in the state. So 
that, first of all, it would be clear to the

39:02.332 --> 39:12.144
entities, the citizens of the state, how to access 
TEAS. And it would also give TEAS greater

39:12.164 --> 39:27.923
visibility so that the legislators, the 
leadership of Texas would understand its value

39:12.164 --> 39:27.923
and potential. And it's helping gain the support 
it needed in order to do the job it can do.

39:33.685 --> 39:58.014
So because I had been told that that was, in almost 
everybody's opinion, something that needed now

39:33.685 --> 39:58.014
to be done for this agency, I wasn't shocked in the 
Texas 2000 study to know or to learn that Tease was

39:33.685 --> 39:58.014
not known or understood. Tease is not known or 
understood in Texas A&M University. Still isn't.

40:04.162 --> 40:07.145
It's known now. It's become very visible, very 
active, and it's grown at an incredible pace. But

40:19.677 --> 40:21.599
it's not understood. It's perceived

40:21.780 --> 40:25.924
often to be things it isn't. And typically, when 
things are not understood, they're feared. It's a

40:28.666 --> 40:30.188
human nature. Is that one of your major programs is 
trying to get peace understood within the system

40:30.208 --> 40:33.291
itself? Absolutely, sure. All people that have a 
need or an opportunity or a desire to work through

40:36.035 --> 40:46.508
teens. My philosophy is, as an educator, the more 
everybody knows, the better off we all are. And a

40:53.617 --> 41:02.248
difference of opinion, in my opinion, is healthy, 
as long as we keep it in perspective and keep it

40:53.617 --> 41:02.248
constructive. So no, I was not surprised. But when 
I saw the recommendations, the first report of the

41:04.632 --> 41:16.347
Texas 2000, I didn't sit around and wring my hand. I 
went immediately to the person who was

41:16.367 --> 41:28.362
responsible for having written that and told

41:16.367 --> 41:28.362
them that, first of all, I didn't appreciate it. 
Secondly, the reason I didn't appreciate it was

41:28.382 --> 41:31.746
because it was incorrect. And thirdly, I'd be 
happy to share with him why I felt that way and get

41:31.996 --> 41:39.124
his opinion. Did that commission really make it 
easier for you to become this way? Has it brought it

41:45.030 --> 41:45.711
out in the open? I think that that helped. Because 
when I said those things to Vic Arnold, actually,

41:51.358 --> 41:59.927
who was heading up the Texas 2000 Commission, at

42:01.477 --> 42:15.195
least the working

42:01.477 --> 42:15.195
end of it. And I mean

42:15.215 --> 42:27.692
by that, he was the person who had the 
responsibility, literally, for the staff that

42:15.215 --> 42:27.692
was pulling all the staff together. He was 
surprised. I just challenged him. He was

42:29.034 --> 42:29.374
receptive. And I said, all right, I'd like to hear. 
So I immediately set up a meeting with him the very

42:33.729 --> 42:39.497
next week. Went to Austin. And we sat down, and he 
told me some of the thoughts he had about how to

42:42.581 --> 42:57.960
build a program, define a program, get it funded, 
to try to help create new businesses for the state.

42:59.290 --> 43:07.442
We had NTs already begun to work on the

42:59.290 --> 43:07.442
Institute for Ventures and Technology earlier. 
We didn't have that name for it at that time. We were

43:10.546 --> 43:19.279
still calling it the Small Business Development

43:10.546 --> 43:19.279
Center or something like that. But we had the 
concept well defined. We already had the proposal

43:21.422 --> 43:25.628
in the NSF. And we were moving. We weren't talking 
about an idea that we were thinking about getting

43:27.421 --> 43:33.889
ready to define. We already were moving on. And in a 
meeting of the 2,000 that identified, I think,

43:37.493 --> 43:53.833
seven areas of critical importance to the state, 
one of which was research and development, and in a

43:37.493 --> 43:53.833
meeting at LTV, I think one of theirs, of that R&D 
committee. I was then invited the following week

44:01.115 --> 44:16.176
to come make the presentation of this idea and how 
it would function and how it would be funded

44:01.115 --> 44:16.176
through the governor's R&D committee. And we were 
ready. And I took Bill Muse, who was then the dean of

44:20.664 --> 44:37.268
the College of Business, who had

44:20.664 --> 44:37.268
been working from the outset in the proposal 
preparation. And he and I and Jane Armstrong, who

44:37.288 --> 44:42.015
was then my assistant, went to that meeting and 
laid out the proposal. And there was just a

44:42.035 --> 44:44.779
dramatic turnaround. in the concept of how the 
state might proceed

44:45.637 --> 44:56.570
to accomplish that. And I think that gave T's 
visibility. What about the

45:02.157 --> 45:12.649
N, MCC?

45:12.669 --> 45:13.230
Well, Of course, you know what NCC is and how it came 
about. Well, some of them. But briefly, it was an

45:24.832 --> 45:31.663
idea of one man, as most ideas are. Although it's 
hard to have a unique one. You can often then find

45:33.747 --> 45:37.733
out who the other men were that might have had it 
about the same time. But Bill Lawrence, who's the

45:38.489 --> 45:47.655
Chairman of the Board of the Controlled Danical 
Commission, had been pushing a concept like the

45:38.489 --> 45:47.655
NMCC.
