WEBVTT

00:03.372 --> 00:03.893
Okay. They said, well, we know your 
circumstances, and we've had people from our

00:04.714 --> 00:29.329
company here before that have been in the same can 
groups with military, and we know that you only get

00:04.714 --> 00:29.329
a small per diem, which can't possibly take care of 
all your living expenses, and it will really be a

00:04.714 --> 00:29.329
financial burden to you unless you're a wealthy 
man independently for you and your family for you

00:04.714 --> 00:29.329
to be here. And he said, we want to tell you 
something. We don't want you to ever try to pick up a

00:35.473 --> 00:39.419
check when we go out to eat. And we want to pay your 
phone bill. It'll be divided up between all of us

00:43.905 --> 00:48.992
and put on our expense accounts, which are 
unlimited. And any other expenses you have, we

00:50.154 --> 00:53.258
want to pay for. And I said, for Christ's sake, what 
do you think I am? I said, hell, I'm not going to

00:58.170 --> 01:01.333
accept charity from you guys. Sure, it might be a 
little bit of a financial burden to me, but I'm just

01:02.014 --> 01:08.681
not going to do it. And I said, I couldn't let you pay 
my phone bill and my laundry bill. You want to pay my

01:16.409 --> 01:18.471
laundry bill, too, see? Send out your clothes, 
shirts, and everything. So they said, well, why

01:22.465 --> 01:33.059
don't you just let us do what we can then, and you 
keep your self-respect, if you call it that. But we

01:33.099 --> 01:35.021
really said it's done. It's been done for years. 
And the president of my company, this was Ed

01:37.584 --> 01:45.935
Donnelly saying it, he said the president of my 
company, when he was up here six years ago, he said

01:37.584 --> 01:45.935
they did it. He told me just before I left, he said, 
now, if there are any military in your can groups,

01:50.748 --> 01:52.651
put their expenses on your tab. And so I couldn't 
wait to get to the other military guys. They said,

01:59.280 --> 02:01.663
yeah, we've had a meeting just like it. And most of 
them took the same attitude I did. But they did pay a

02:05.628 --> 02:09.593
lot of my expenses. And a couple of times, I just 
damn near fought them over picking up checks. So it

02:14.180 --> 02:19.607
did cost me, oh, I guess maybe $1,500, $1,600. But 
nevertheless, they helped quite a bit. Oh, yeah.

02:24.065 --> 02:25.406
Now, why do you think they do that? I think they do it 
because it's a genuine feeling of,

02:27.789 --> 02:46.607
I don't know whether it's appreciation or a 
general feeling of wanting to be of service and

02:27.789 --> 02:46.607
help somebody from the military or from 
government that doesn't have the the financial

02:46.925 --> 02:51.492
backing to really enjoy the full fruits of the 
endeavor. And I don't think they want to try to gain

02:52.293 --> 03:04.210
any brownie points for their company with anybody 
because I've never had any dealings with any of

02:52.293 --> 03:04.210
them and didn't anticipate ever having any 
official dealings with any of them. But the last,

03:04.230 --> 03:12.843
the crowning achievement of things, the last week 
at the AMP is called Wives Week. And they

03:12.863 --> 03:15.767
traditionally have the wives come up And 
everybody moves out of the can group to a downtown

03:16.237 --> 03:20.083
hotel. They all book rooms, all contiguous to one 
another. And all the wives are there. The wives

03:26.373 --> 03:29.318
make some of the classes. They have some special 
classes for wives, four or five hours of classes

03:29.338 --> 03:35.889
during the week. There are three or four big 
parties of entertainment, and then a final big

03:35.909 --> 03:42.700
graduation banquet and party. It's a very 
expensive week, the wives' week. Air

03:45.943 --> 03:50.588
transportation up there, staying at the Ritz, our 
kin group stayed at the Ritz. So we were living in

03:51.549 --> 03:56.554
Atlanta at the Third Army, and my wife came up there 
and left the kids. She flew up. So we were there at

03:58.536 --> 03:59.817
the Ritz. We took part in everything all during the 
week and just had a heck of a good time. So we were

04:03.541 --> 04:08.586
going to check out early Sunday morning to catch an 
early flight back to Atlanta. And I went down about

04:09.764 --> 04:15.732
7 o'clock to get my tab and pay my bill. We figured we 
owed $200, $250. So I went to the desk and they said,

04:20.718 --> 04:26.265
well, Colonel, we haven't got a bill for you. I 
said, what the hell do you mean? And they said,

04:28.808 --> 04:30.430
well, we just have it. I said, you don't have a bill. 
And I said, you've got to be kidding me. And they

04:35.988 --> 04:38.190
said, no, I said, well, who paid for it? I said, God 
damn it, somebody must have paid for it. My wife and

04:41.434 --> 04:43.657
I have been here for six days. And they said, well, 
you just haven't got a bill. And so finally, the

04:47.961 --> 04:55.290
assistant manager says, look, why don't you just 
be a good guy and just forget about it and walk off?

04:55.370 --> 04:57.552
And don't ask me any more questions. He says, 
believe me, you haven't got a bill. So I don't know

05:00.575 --> 05:06.560
who paid for it, or whether they divided it up on 
their bills or not. And I later saw one of the other

05:07.541 --> 05:14.487
military, and he said the same thing happened to 
him. No kidding. No kidding, yeah. Everybody from

05:16.969 --> 05:24.656
government, when they went to pay their bill for 
Wives Week, the hotel just said, well, you haven't

05:16.969 --> 05:24.656
got a bill. And they couldn't even give them a copy 
of the bill. They just said, you have no bill. Isn't

05:29.819 --> 05:31.280
that something? That's fantastic. And I think 
it's still being done today. And they're just

05:35.784 --> 05:50.778
about the same number of guys going, because I get 
all the news from the Harvard Business School and

05:35.784 --> 05:50.778
the AMP programs have about the same, no more, no 
less, same people from the military and from the

05:35.784 --> 05:50.778
Army. And when you so-called graduate, what do 
they give you, a diploma that you were in this

05:50.798 --> 05:55.002
course? Yeah, you get a diploma, a nice little 
diploma. You become a member of the Harvard

05:57.164 --> 05:59.826
alumni. I think that's how they build up their 
massive alumni that continually plague you for

06:00.143 --> 06:08.111
money and so forth. But it's a real great 
experience. It's a certificate then that you pass

06:11.654 --> 06:14.877
this course. How rigorous was the course? Pretty 
doggone rigorous. We worked every night until 10

06:18.200 --> 06:25.527
or 11 o'clock on all these case studies. 
Everything was on case studies. So usually you

06:27.589 --> 06:29.391
worked with your TAN group. Work with your can 
group, yeah. And sometime on maybe a special

06:31.373 --> 06:41.047
project, you'd work with guys from other can 
groups that were in your section or in the group

06:31.373 --> 06:41.047
that the professor had assigned. But it was, and I, 
many times I used a lot of things I got,

06:41.067 --> 06:49.280
particularly in the labor relations. I had this 
very eminent little German guy that was a

06:49.560 --> 06:56.931
professor.

06:59.054 --> 07:10.644
And then this guy that talked about 
constitutional law and antitrust legislation,

06:59.054 --> 07:10.644
he was just absolutely superb. So you thought the 
professors at Harvard were quite good. Oh, yeah.

07:15.889 --> 07:20.172
And it was many of the things that I used 
extensively. I know in my command at the Defense

07:20.252 --> 07:28.960
Industrial Supply Center that just prior to my 
last command, in some very tedious steel

07:30.053 --> 07:34.319
negotiations that the government was having with 
big steel. While some of the things that I learned

07:35.281 --> 07:46.177
and gained and gleaned at that, uh, uh, advanced 
management program really were of great

07:35.281 --> 07:46.177
assistance to me. And I, I think it's a very 
worthwhile thing. It certainly, uh, but for five

07:48.761 --> 07:56.112
months we were, you know, separated from our, from 
the military completely and, uh, It's looked upon

07:57.003 --> 08:01.288
very, very strongly by the military.

08:05.954 --> 08:18.028
People kind of bow down to you when you get an 
appointment to go to the Harvard Business School,

08:05.954 --> 08:18.028
to the advanced management program.

08:18.049 --> 08:19.911
And I want to talk about getting to France. OK.

08:25.201 --> 08:51.934
My tour of duty, I was in charge of the

08:25.201 --> 08:51.934
operations division in the G4 section of U.S. 
UConn, United States European Command, which was

08:25.201 --> 08:51.934
the supreme headquarters in Europe at Camp du 
Loge, just outside of Paris, right in the suburbs

08:25.201 --> 08:51.934
of Paris. And the Supreme Commander at that time 
was General Charles Palmer, Charles D. Palmer.

09:00.227 --> 09:22.258
And the work there was logistics, joint logistics 
at this high level involving a lot of contact with

09:00.227 --> 09:22.258
NATO allies and a lot of contact and activity in 
connection with NATO facilities, particularly

09:22.593 --> 09:29.681
the NATO pipeline system throughout Europe. And 
it's a network of pipelines in the low countries

09:30.381 --> 09:52.245
and a network of pipelines from the coast of 
France, across France, into West Germany, all the

09:30.381 --> 09:52.245
way to the Rhine River, so that in the event of a war, 
we can unload tankers on the French coast or even in

09:30.381 --> 09:52.245
the low countries and pump jet fuel or diesel fuel 
or motor fuel through this pipeline network right

09:52.985 --> 10:00.435
on as far forward as the Rhine River. And this is all 
underground pipeline built pipeline system in

10:01.637 --> 10:11.550
the U.S. And a beautiful setup. We even built 
pipelines in Turkey. We built NATO pipelines in

10:14.795 --> 10:22.165
Turkey, throughout Turkey, and built a few 
pipelines in North Africa. short pipelines to

10:22.533 --> 10:33.426
serve the Pueblos Airport in Libya which is now 
turned back of course to the Libyans and I'm sure

10:22.533 --> 10:33.426
Qaddafi is using all those facilities now. It 
involved a lot of travel to the Middle East and back

10:34.868 --> 10:51.088
and forth to the Middle East, inspection type 
travel and visiting all types of facilities like

10:34.868 --> 10:51.088
air bases and Eastern Turkey, and checking on the 
support of the U.S. to our NATO allies through the

10:51.845 --> 11:03.238
aid programs and what have you. Very, very 
interesting job. And it was there in Paris that I

11:06.541 --> 11:11.547
got word that I was nominated to be a general 
officer. Yeah, tell me about that. How did that

11:12.688 --> 11:16.873
come about, and what were your feelings at the 
time? Well, of course, we had known that a

11:17.292 --> 11:25.220
selection board was convening.

11:25.281 --> 11:32.708
Everybody does that's in the zone knows that a 
selection board is convening to make nominees. So

11:33.930 --> 11:42.439
I hadn't really given a whole lot of thought about 
it, or certainly hadn't worried about it. And one

11:43.860 --> 11:46.303
morning, I I was late to work. I think it was 
probably the only time during the three years I was

11:49.292 --> 11:58.906
assigned there in headquarters that I didn't get 
into the office till about 8.30, 8.45. Because I

11:59.607 --> 12:12.686
had just bought a French car, a little Simca, a 
little four-door Simca, and I had to take it by a

11:59.607 --> 12:12.686
French garage because the windshield wipers 
weren't working good or something. Anyway, I took

12:12.786 --> 12:14.569
it by the garage and They gave me a ride to the gates 
of Camp Delos, and I walked from the main gate into

12:15.089 --> 12:21.159
my office. So when I got into my office, my office, 
there were four or five officers in there, my

12:21.179 --> 12:31.695
secretary was in there, and a couple of civilians, 
and I said, what the hell's going on? And they said,

12:31.735 --> 12:34.580
well, why don't you read the message on your desk? 
So there was a cable on my desk from the Edgerton

12:35.802 --> 12:42.953
General notifying me that I had been nominated by 
the president. to be a general officer. And about

12:47.321 --> 12:51.726
that time my secretary came back and he always 
said, General Palmer wants to see you. He called.

12:52.266 --> 13:00.415
As a matter of fact, she said he called 10 minutes 
ago and we had to tell him that you were out for a

12:52.266 --> 13:00.415
moment. So I said, well, I guess I better go in to see 
the old man. So I went down right away and was

13:04.459 --> 13:07.682
ushered right in. And he congratulated me and told 
me to sit down. And he talked a little bit, and then I

13:12.295 --> 13:26.918
told him, and tried to be as humble as I could, that 
there's certainly a lot of more people more worthy

13:12.295 --> 13:26.918
and deserving than me that should have been 
selected. While I'm very honored, I know that

13:26.938 --> 13:34.670
there's a hell of a lot of people that deserve it 
more than I did. He looked at me and he said, look, he

13:34.730 --> 13:39.197
said, it's nice of you to say that. But just 
remember this. God damn it, they had the same

13:42.427 --> 13:44.991
chance you had. And I've always remembered that. 
And he looked me right in the eye, and he said it very

13:47.975 --> 13:52.502
sincerely. And I really appreciated it. He was a 
very, very great guy, a nice guy. Not a household

14:01.096 --> 14:03.579
word. He had a brother that also was a four-star 
general. the two Palmer brothers, Charlie Palmer

14:09.518 --> 14:16.245
and his brother, a little short fella. I forget 
what his first name was. But both of them were

14:20.350 --> 14:23.273
really outstanding officers. Both of them had 
big, had high combat commands during the war,

14:23.313 --> 14:29.901
division commanders or corps commanders. And 
very capable administrators, both of them. And he

14:34.986 --> 14:38.310
was very, he was very, very really really meant a 
lot to me and for him to say all the things that he did

14:39.877 --> 15:09.495
say and immediately after that why he must have 
directed that they start to uh you know give me all

14:39.877 --> 15:09.495
the privileges and everything of the flag even 
though it was oh hell it was about seven months six

14:39.877 --> 15:09.495
months before i got my star because of the 
vacancies they have to wait until somebody

14:39.877 --> 15:09.495
retired and so forth and then there was some hitch 
came up some congressman some senator on the armed

15:10.454 --> 15:37.828
service committee wanted to charge some general 
officer spots in the national guard division to

15:10.454 --> 15:37.828
the regular general officer roster and that 
delayed it another month or two because they they

15:10.454 --> 15:37.828
tagged the three or four spaces in the in the 
national guard division to the general to the

15:10.454 --> 15:37.828
general officer roster of the regular army well 
anyway uh us ucom

15:40.593 --> 15:57.807
I already had a staff card that I, that was my own, 
that was assigned to me from my job, but about two

15:40.593 --> 15:57.807
weeks later I got a new one, a little bit, you know, a 
brand new one, without even asking for it, and the

15:40.593 --> 15:57.807
other one I had was perfectly good. And it was just a 
lot of little things like that. It was so obvious.

16:04.093 --> 16:10.498
But it was, it was very good, and I stayed there for 
about, 90 days. And then I was transferred back to

16:14.974 --> 16:38.968
the States to help put together the Defense Supply 
Agency, which was this new joint agency that

16:14.974 --> 16:38.968
Secretary McNamara had decreed that he wanted 
done. Okay, but before we get to that, let's Let's

16:42.760 --> 16:50.809
talk about France leaving or kicking the United 
States out of their country early in the 1960s.

16:51.330 --> 16:52.451
Were you there at that time? No, I was not there at 
that time, but I made a trip over there. Okay. A

16:56.576 --> 17:06.548
couple of trips over there, and we had to, I first 
went into Germany, and we had to get into civilian

16:56.576 --> 17:06.548
clothes before we went on into France. No kidding. 
No kidding. They told me when I got to France. What

17:11.313 --> 17:12.615
were your feelings about that? Well, I just 
thought it was awful that I couldn't, as an

17:12.832 --> 17:31.014
American officer, and I was already a general, and 
that I couldn't, as an American general, get off of

17:12.832 --> 17:31.014
the airplane at Orly Field, a military airplane at 
Orly Field, and go into Paris in my uniform. That I

17:31.715 --> 17:33.557
had to wear civilian clothes. And it's the honest 
to God's truth. Well, what were most of the

17:37.571 --> 17:40.173
feelings of the American officers? Well, they 
were the same. They were the same. And it was awful.

17:43.316 --> 17:47.741
The French people, per se, of course, nobody knew 
who you were. You're walking down the street in

17:47.761 --> 17:50.203
civilian clothes. That's fine. But the people you 
had contact with, they didn't have any big change

17:50.884 --> 17:58.751
of heart to you outwardly or to your face. They 
didn't say you were a no-good and so forth. But...

18:05.363 --> 18:09.728
You really, it was kind of a bitter pill, really. 
And the French have not done a very good job on this,

18:10.770 --> 18:22.444
to jump ahead a few years, this survey I made for the 
Department of Defense of the pipeline. See, when

18:23.205 --> 18:34.358
the French kicked us out, instead of us having U.S. 
personnel along the pipeline through France, the

18:23.205 --> 18:34.358
French now run it with a contractor civilian 
contractor. There's no U.S. military on the

18:37.583 --> 18:40.426
pipeline at all. And when I saw it about four years 
ago, it was pitiful. I'd say, I've got it in my

18:48.696 --> 18:58.227
report, but about 30% of the pumping units are 
inoperable. They've been robbed of spare parts to

18:59.409 --> 19:03.113
keep some of the other ones going. They're just 
like what we call hangar queens, airplanes that

19:03.768 --> 19:11.377
have been robbed of spare parts to keep other 
airplanes flying. You've got an airplane in a

19:11.417 --> 19:18.946
hangar that won't fly because some wings have been 
taken off or ailerons have been taken off. Why

19:19.086 --> 19:21.509
don't they order parts from American companies? I 
don't know. But rather than spend the money, they

19:22.370 --> 19:30.720
just cannibalize spare engines and spare pumps 
and compressors in the pump stations. Two or three

19:31.763 --> 19:38.370
pump stations that I visited along the line were 
absolutely inoperable. And the product that goes

19:39.252 --> 19:45.719
through the line is only a very small amount that 
they keep pumping through the line. This is some of

19:46.400 --> 19:53.227
our product that is unloaded and pumped all 
through the line into Germany just to make the line

19:46.400 --> 19:53.227
operational. It loses capacity and loses fluid 
velocity and everything because this pump

19:54.269 --> 20:01.737
station is inoperable to keep it moving. limps 
along at a very slow pace, so the throughput in the

20:02.189 --> 20:08.558
line is greatly reduced. And the maintenance of 
the thing is just awful. The stations, the weeds

20:11.562 --> 20:16.850
are growing up around them, the paint is peeling 
off the wall. It just makes you sick. Because

20:19.073 --> 20:23.119
American money, taxpayer money, built that 
goddamn system. I think when the pipeline system

20:24.200 --> 20:30.930
across France cost about 90 million dollars, and 
The French are not taking care of it. I don't know

20:35.534 --> 20:36.576
what they did. I rendered my report to DOD and they 
haven't asked me to go back again. I imagine they

20:43.024 --> 20:45.848
will one of these days ask me to go back again. I was 
spent about two weeks looking at it. Went to

20:50.775 --> 21:01.390
Donges, that's D-O-N-G-E-S on the channel, 
Channel Coast where the tankers unload and that

20:50.775 --> 21:01.390
unloading facility was in very bad shape too. But a 
French hate a rich uncle. That's their

21:06.641 --> 21:07.682
philosophy. And I've had French people tell me 
that because a good friend of mine, an officer,

21:07.722 --> 21:14.508
married a French gal. And we know him very well. 
He's dead now. But the French hate a rich uncle. And

21:24.477 --> 21:26.639
we've seen it several times. And it's 
particularly evident in Paris, a Parisian

21:31.475 --> 21:35.801
expresses all of the bad things about the French 
psychology. Now, the people out in the provinces

21:36.262 --> 21:39.687
are pretty good guys. They're just good old 
country people. But the haughty Parisians are

21:42.551 --> 21:46.798
despicable, really. They really are despicable. 
And the wife and I were over there last November.

21:52.666 --> 21:55.310
Crime in Paris today is pitiful. Oh, it's awful. 
Subways. The metro system, the beautiful subway

21:57.573 --> 21:59.997
they've got. When you ride the Metro, by God, be 
sure you've got your billfold velcroed in your

22:00.770 --> 22:10.339
pocket or zippered in your pocket because of 
pickpockets. We were targeted pickpockets on the

22:10.359 --> 22:13.782
Metro. Three guys, three Algerian-looking 
students, dashed in on us and bumped into us and

22:13.962 --> 22:30.658
then went right out the door before the door closed 
at the Metro stop, at the Concord Metro stop, which

22:13.962 --> 22:30.658
is a very busy one. Did they get your wallet? No. I 
had some jackets I wear, particularly overseas,

22:35.055 --> 22:43.084
with zippers in the inside coat pocket. Put the 
wallet in there and close the zipper. And there's

22:46.288 --> 22:48.430
all sorts of things now. There's a little wallet 
thing you can put on your leg. It's an elastic

22:51.113 --> 22:52.715
thing. Slip it on over your sock. You can put your 
wallet right down in it. There's all sorts of

22:57.780 --> 22:58.761
things. But the best thing, and you can put a flap on 
your pocket on your inside coat pocket with

23:03.342 --> 23:05.886
Velcro. And built that up. But I've got two or three 
jackets with zippers in the inside pockets. And

23:12.575 --> 23:13.336
that's perfect. Now let's talk about McNamara and 
you helping set up the Defense Supply Agency. What

23:20.426 --> 23:21.788
was the rationale for that? Why did McNamara want 
that? He wanted a joint facility, a joint

23:23.831 --> 23:29.940
activity, a joint agency take care of the 
requirements of all the services, staffed by

23:31.068 --> 23:43.863
people from all the services, to avoid and save 
duplication of effort and duplication of

23:31.068 --> 23:43.863
activity and services. Now what I'm going to say, 
you won't hear from a lot of military guys of any

23:45.024 --> 23:56.097
rank, but I think Bob McNamara is the only 
Secretary of Defense we ever had. He was the only

23:56.802 --> 24:19.975
one with the vision and the courage and the guts to 
do some of these things, to do away with this

23:56.802 --> 24:19.975
absolutely foolish, wasteful, and scandalous 
self-service interest that some of my peers and

23:56.802 --> 24:19.975
colleagues in the military services hold out for 
their respective services. We have gone too far.

24:22.340 --> 24:23.762
Life is too complex. Weapon systems are too 
expensive for petty service jealousies and

24:24.463 --> 24:31.670
rights to prevail. We've got to have one central 
defense effort and activity staffed and manned by

24:32.251 --> 24:48.949
people of the various disciplines, Army, Navy, 
Air Force, Marines, and to do away with the damn

24:32.251 --> 24:48.949
duplication of effort. And a lot has happened 
since the start of this, but a hell of a lot more

24:49.739 --> 24:57.346
remains to be done. You may have been reading 
recently about some of the battles in the Joint

24:58.086 --> 25:04.012
Chiefs of Staff where they want to make some 
changes. And they've just got to do it because

25:04.972 --> 25:19.425
there are still some people that just hold out, you 
know, they say, well, hell, this is an Army role,

25:04.972 --> 25:19.425
this is an Army responsibility, and they ought to 
do it. We ought to do it. We the Army ought to do it. A

25:22.901 --> 25:25.484
lot of guys in the Air Force say the same thing. A lot 
of guys in the Navy. I think the guys in the Navy and

25:27.466 --> 25:37.799
the Army are the worst so far as being jealous of 
their prerogatives and their roles and their

25:27.466 --> 25:37.799
missions. I believe the Air Force are more 
joint-minded. At least I found that from my

25:41.543 --> 25:44.046
experience. McNamara wanted to do this because, 
for what I've said, he did it. And I had the

25:51.077 --> 25:59.005
opportunity to help create it from the ground 
floor of this defense supply agency. And he picked

26:00.006 --> 26:07.113
AT McNamara, General McNamara, to head the thing 
up. And there was a nuclear service of about 12

26:07.133 --> 26:12.919
officers. that arrived in Washington. We went to 
Temporary Building A down on Buzzard Point right

26:15.170 --> 26:25.320
adjacent to the Fort McNair there, a temporary 
building built in World War II. And we were in there

26:26.281 --> 26:34.930
for about four months and putting the thing 
together organizationally and gathering people

26:26.281 --> 26:34.930
in from the services. Then we moved over to Cameron 
Station over in Virginia and they rehabilitated

26:35.831 --> 26:42.298
offices for us. We had all kinds of problems 
getting people from the services to help staff the

26:43.004 --> 26:51.032
organization. The Army and a lot of the staff, you 
know, they would send us not the best guys, but some

26:51.052 --> 26:58.660
of their mediocre guys. It's awful. Why would they 
do that? Because they were against it. They were

27:02.584 --> 27:03.765
against it. They were against it. So the 
hierarchy, the Army Chief of Staff was against it.

27:09.430 --> 27:21.310
And the people, we the people that served in the 
joint agencies suffered in our respective

27:09.430 --> 27:21.310
service because of our service in the joint staffs 
in the joint agencies. But I'm proud and happy to

27:21.411 --> 27:31.067
have been a part of the beginning of joint defense 
efforts in this country because The quicker we get

27:31.790 --> 27:39.580
to it in a clean, pure basis, the cheaper, the more 
bang we're going to get for the buck. And it's just

27:40.802 --> 27:43.926
pitiful, really. And was the function of the 
Defense Supply Agency to coordinate all of the

27:44.206 --> 27:54.880
supplies that are needed for all services? Not 
only coordinate, but actually take control. The

27:58.486 --> 28:07.938
inventory control, the procurement of them, the 
management of them, and then issue them out to the

27:58.486 --> 28:07.938
services based on what they've asked for. Yeah, 
absolutely. All the common supplies. And then

28:12.044 --> 28:23.278
there was always a fight of whether the service 
would turn it over to the DSA because, oh, they

28:12.044 --> 28:23.278
said, no, we've got to manage this because this is 
peculiar to our missions. And even though the Navy

28:24.187 --> 28:31.814
used the same thing, and the Air Force used the same 
thing, they said, no, we've got to manage this.

28:31.874 --> 28:35.016
Well, it was a slow, painful process. But 
gradually and gradually, we took away all of the

28:35.076 --> 28:45.726
things that were specifically jointly used 
things. But you'd be surprised. They would argue

28:47.007 --> 28:53.012
about things like mundane things, like 
underwear. Oh, this particular type of

28:53.465 --> 28:57.351
underwear, this is peculiar to the Navy. Even 
certain foodstuffs and everything, certain

28:58.553 --> 29:03.180
rations, operational rations. How did you ever 
get over all that nonsense? Well, McNamara

29:07.346 --> 29:17.582
issued, you know, certain, and the Secretary, he, 
the Secretary of Defense, and he had the backing of

29:07.346 --> 29:17.582
the White House, and...

29:19.216 --> 29:22.160
It was painful, but it came about. It came about, 
and it came about very quickly. And, of course,

29:25.304 --> 29:28.128
they're still fighting today about a lot of 
things. They're fighting today about a lot of

29:28.729 --> 29:30.511
things. A lot of even weapon systems and certain 
vehicles. They're fighting. All the things

29:41.045 --> 29:43.529
they're fighting about today are the hard ones. 
The easy ones and the not-so-hard ones that we've

29:44.310 --> 29:48.295
already... put in joint operation. Like all the 
uniforms? All the uniforms, all the ammunition,

29:52.992 --> 29:58.482
and things like that. There's, line item wise, 
Probably close to six, seven, 800,000 different

30:01.825 --> 30:06.773
line items. No kidding. That are in joint supply 
now, yeah. Where's the warehouse for this? I

30:11.520 --> 30:13.182
suppose there's a number of warehouses. There 
must be enormous. Number of depots. The largest

30:16.447 --> 30:24.019
ones are in Ogden, Utah, New Cumberland, 
Pennsylvania.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.852
Anniston, Alabama. Did you have to take these over 
from them? Yeah, we took these over. You took these

30:31.217 --> 30:33.900
over from the individual services? Sure did. They 
must have complained. DSA depots, yeah. All of

30:37.184 --> 30:38.847
this came about. It's a massive thing. Did you keep 
the original commanders in charge of those? In

30:43.513 --> 30:45.535
most cases we did, yes. Most cases. But then the 
next commander went to a comparable officer from

30:47.037 --> 30:54.006
another service. So an Air Force commander would 
go in and take over a Navy depot. From a Navy depot,

30:58.740 --> 31:08.012
and then the next commander might be a guy from the 
Army, and his deputy might be a guy from the Navy or a

30:58.740 --> 31:08.012
guy from the Air Force. Just like when I commanded 
the Defense Industrial Supply Center in

31:08.673 --> 31:16.824
northeast Philadelphia, it had been a Navy 
command. It was responsible and is responsible

31:17.465 --> 31:23.132
now for all of the... the fasteners, the bearings, 
the sheet steel, the sheet aluminum, the plate

31:23.905 --> 31:39.941
steel, the gaskets, and the bearings, I mentioned 
that, and the aircraft fasteners, and bolts and

31:23.905 --> 31:39.941
nuts. It's responsible for about 400,000 line 
items. And we had them stored in these DSA depots at

31:44.085 --> 31:51.212
about five locations around the country. and 
everything was, all the requisitions are on a

31:51.580 --> 32:00.653
computer basis and distribution and shipping 
orders were on a computer basis. And this was a real

32:01.794 --> 32:09.585
interesting operation, a real can of worms with 
all those different things. We had in Northeast

32:09.686 --> 32:19.900
Philly at this old Naval Supply Depot 
headquarters, I had about 150 officers of all the

32:09.686 --> 32:19.900
services. about 2,000 civilians and then 
scattered around in the procurement offices and

32:20.656 --> 32:28.146
about that many again. And

32:28.166 --> 32:37.639
this was after I left the headquarters and they 
sent me out to run one of these joint activities.

32:37.679 --> 32:49.836
Then I went from there down to southeast 
Philadelphia just for one end of Philadelphia the

32:37.679 --> 32:49.836
other to take over the personnel support center 
which is the largest one of the joint supply

32:50.052 --> 33:09.748
centers because of its it's the largest one from a 
monetary standpoint because of other than from

32:50.052 --> 33:09.748
weapon systems because of food clothing medical 
organizational equipment and the like now you

32:50.052 --> 33:09.748
being in the groundwork here for the design supply 
You must have irritated some of your superiors.

33:13.425 --> 33:14.406
Oh, yes. No question about it. And that might be 
another reason why you didn't get that second

33:15.969 --> 33:20.275
star. Well, it might have been, but I think 
everybody

33:20.435 --> 33:38.402
that had any interest in it is all satisfied it's 
because of the Eisenhower-George Gordon Moore

33:20.435 --> 33:38.402
incident and some of the residual feedback and 
results from that. It could have been, could have

33:38.855 --> 33:40.617
been. But did you irritate a lot of your superiors? 
Yes, I'm sure I did. I'm sure I did. There's no

33:47.564 --> 33:48.985
question about it. No question about it. Even some 
of the people, well, in my own service army,

33:50.887 --> 34:04.481
because, you know, they would refer to you as a DSA 
type or a joint staff type. And everybody suffered

34:04.501 --> 34:08.085
a little bit. from it, from the services. But 
that's gradually disappearing and now in my last

34:12.861 --> 34:25.215
command I have, the guy that took over from me was a 
Navy Admiral. And then the guy that took over from

34:26.597 --> 34:29.961
him was an Air Force Major General. And the guy 
that's there now is an Army Major General. And on

34:37.429 --> 34:38.190
your The only Brigadier to have that job. Yes, I'm 
the only one that's had that job since 1967. Yeah,

34:47.145 --> 34:49.333
since I left there. I think you're right. I think 
the record will show that. This is, of course, one

34:53.112 --> 35:00.902
of McNamara's desires to centralize the whole 
system and streamline the whole system.

35:00.922 --> 35:02.324
Streamline and centralize. And it's sort of like 
setting up the Defense Intelligence Agency at the

35:02.844 --> 35:08.331
same time. I had a good friend that was mixed up in 
that, and oh my God, the arguments they had about

35:08.772 --> 35:15.160
that. You wouldn't believe it. Do you know General 
Maples? No. No? I sure didn't know him. He was in on

35:22.358 --> 35:29.306
that, and he was also a... Have you had some guys say 
the same thing about this joint business? It's

35:30.467 --> 35:31.548
pitiful. It really is pitiful. I think that the 
presidents have been derelict in their duty as

35:34.691 --> 35:44.762
commander-in-chief. all of them that have 
happened since McNamara's time, for not sounding

35:45.552 --> 35:59.511
out and saying more publicly and in service debate 
and in service direction. I think the people that

35:59.611 --> 36:08.083
have occupied the Oval Office and the White House 
could have done a hell of a lot to help speed this

35:59.611 --> 36:08.083
thing along. Of course, it's come along a long, 
long way. But there's still a long way to go and

36:11.573 --> 36:26.933
there's billions of dollars in the offing because 
the duplication of effort and the duplication of

36:11.573 --> 36:26.933
roles and missions, it's just scandalous, 
really. Tell me about McNamara. I liked the guy. I

36:33.041 --> 36:34.403
really liked the guy. What did you like about him? 
You were one of the very first generals that I've

36:35.645 --> 36:39.049
interviewed who liked him. Most of them say that he 
was very bright, but he was obnoxious and that he

36:39.299 --> 36:46.168
had no respect for the military. Well, that's not 
true. He did have respect for the military.

36:50.795 --> 36:55.261
McNamara is a very, he's maybe a little bit cocky. 
Most sharp, real sharp guys are when they achieve a

36:56.463 --> 37:02.731
lot of power. Napoleon was. Maybe McNamara is kind 
of like Napoleon in that respect, but McNamara has

37:04.696 --> 37:11.806
a lot of humility. He has a lot of feeling and I got to 
know the guy. I never saw him a whole lot, but he

37:17.914 --> 37:26.886
remembered who I was and he remembered certain 
things about things we had done. He mentioned a

37:26.926 --> 37:32.053
couple of things one time about that was a great job 
you did on all those directed orders and so forth.

37:34.547 --> 37:37.992
Well, that was six months after that happened. And 
he had courage, he had guts, and he was extremely

37:38.012 --> 37:45.542
bright. He was really bright. He was, of course, 
one of the original whiz kids, and you can spell it

37:47.105 --> 37:53.233
all with caps as far as he's concerned. Extremely 
bright. And I know that nearly everybody Almost

38:00.552 --> 38:02.654
everybody doesn't like him. But a lot of people do 
like him, and I just happen to be one that does. Were

38:09.261 --> 38:11.724
you in a lot of meetings or some meetings with him? 
Some, yes. How did he handle them? Very

38:15.127 --> 38:17.429
efficiently, very efficiently. Right to the 
point, and he respected people's opinions. He was

38:23.676 --> 38:29.682
not, you know, he didn't try to force his... Matter 
of fact, he kind of... He was a pretty good

38:31.180 --> 38:37.529
proponent of the decision by committee type, you 
know? Two or three people to handle a task problem

38:38.270 --> 38:47.684
and come up with a committee opinion or a joint 
opinion on it. What did you think of the so-called

38:48.866 --> 38:50.789
whiz kids? Did you have any dealings with those? 
No, I didn't really. I never was thrown in any

38:54.855 --> 38:59.922
contact with that group. McNamara I guess was the 
only one. But I think he did a great service to the

39:06.737 --> 39:15.252
United States, McNamara did. And Kennedy was very 
astute to bring a guy like McNamara in. Of course

39:23.766 --> 39:26.871
Kennedy and McNamara were very, very close. Did 
you ever have any debates with some of your

39:27.003 --> 39:34.893
colleagues in the Army about this since you took 
such an opposite view of most of them that I've

39:27.003 --> 39:34.893
talked to? Lots of them. Lots of them. What they 
say? Well, they say about what you've heard that,

39:40.761 --> 39:49.592
you know, he's obnoxious and autocratic and so 
forth. Nobody ever, ever discounted his ability.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.841
Nobody ever discounted his ability. And I say that 
the charter for the Secretary of Defense is very

39:57.766 --> 40:03.274
strong. He can do just damn near anything if he has 
guts to do it. And that's why I say McNamara is the

40:08.622 --> 40:12.989
only Secretary of Defense we ever had. From what 
I've read, and I don't have any inside

40:13.690 --> 40:25.748
information, but what I've read, I think Caspar 
Weinberger is fairly close to performing much

40:13.690 --> 40:25.748
like McNamara did. But the Secretary of Defense, 
with his charter, has got a hell of a lot of

40:26.285 --> 40:34.680
authority and a hell of a lot of power. And McNamara 
was the only guy that used it, and I think he used it

40:35.962 --> 40:41.131
wisely. And if he'd been there longer, we'd be 
further along. I think we'd have a leaner,

40:45.398 --> 40:50.908
stronger defense posture.

40:54.922 --> 40:56.744
Why don't we take a little walk through the plant? 
Great, let's do that. I was at a cocktail party, and

40:58.967 --> 41:12.743
he was telling a story about a serviceman that had 
had an accident, and the family had had a lot of

40:58.967 --> 41:12.743
hardship and everything, and the guy had tears in 
his eyes. McNamara. McNamara. Tell me that. A

41:15.086 --> 41:15.887
warrant officer. He had spoken to the warrant 
officer's wife. And the guy had a lot of

41:20.933 --> 41:23.376
compassion. I just can't see them telling 
somebody that they don't know anything. Well,

41:30.136 --> 41:37.584
let's continue about your next one, which was 
command of Defense Industrial Supply Center.

41:37.604 --> 41:37.925
Yeah. And was this one of McNamara's babies, too? 
This is one of McNamara's babies. He established

41:43.591 --> 41:49.498
about five of these joint supply of service 
commands where they managed inventory. You got it

41:54.884 --> 41:55.525
on? Yes, I did. Where they managed inventory for 
common items for all the services and procured for

41:56.446 --> 42:05.098
all the services. They were jointly staffed and so 
forth. And the chain of command was directly to the

42:09.004 --> 42:13.410
Secretary of Defense. And we had no operational 
authority from our respective services. It was

42:21.446 --> 42:24.049
all to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. And 
of course, this sometimes worked to a

42:24.870 --> 42:32.740
disadvantage to the individual service officer 
and his relationship with his other service. But

42:32.800 --> 42:39.027
those difficulties were really minimal, and I 
think they mainly revolved around personnel

42:39.479 --> 42:43.523
administration matters primarily. Could you 
give me an example of the type of things that you

42:43.903 --> 42:49.629
would order at the industrial supply? Yeah, steel 
for the Navy shipyards and aluminum plate for the

42:50.229 --> 43:04.664
Air Force maintenance depots like at Kelly Field 
in Texas and at Wright-Patterson. Barings for all

43:04.924 --> 43:08.187
sorts of purposes. components for the nuclear 
submarines and for the repair and all kinds of

43:08.858 --> 43:28.125
aircraft fasteners, wing fasteners and aircraft 
fasteners and things, some common components to

43:08.858 --> 43:28.125
landing gears and things like that. The peculiar 
items in an aircraft were supplied by the Aviation

43:29.206 --> 43:36.857
Supply Office, but the the common things on an 
aircraft and there are many thousands of common

43:37.073 --> 43:43.380
items that can come from any place. And I spent 
about a year at that command and we were very

43:45.162 --> 44:00.560
successful and very satisfying and a vacancy 
opened up at the Defense Personnel Support Center

43:45.162 --> 44:00.560
in South Philly. Kind of an emergency vacancy 
because the then commander who was also an army

44:06.520 --> 44:24.512
type, a major general army, had suffered a heart 
attack, and they wanted him replaced with the

44:06.520 --> 44:24.512
minimum of

44:06.520 --> 44:24.512
lag in operation and authority and so forth. So 
they said, look, we're going to move you down

44:25.533 --> 44:31.043
across town to South Philadelphia to run DPSC. And 
there was quarters on the facility down there, as

44:32.018 --> 44:39.127
well as we had quarters on our facility at the 
industrial supply center. So, hell, we moved over

44:39.928 --> 44:42.412
a weekend. We moved in and took right off. And it was 
there that I found myself during the Vietnam

44:45.876 --> 44:53.526
buildup. Prior to that, I had made an extensive TDY 
trip to Vietnam. and spent about 60 days over there

44:59.778 --> 45:04.542
on some joint matters. And then when I was at DPSC, I 
was sent over by the Secretary of Defense to make an

45:05.563 --> 45:24.800
exhaustive logistical survey of supply 
operations and logistic support of the forces in

45:05.563 --> 45:24.800
Southeast Asia. And what did you find when you went 
over there? When was that, 1966? No, this was in,

45:29.090 --> 45:32.376
yeah, it was early 66. A lot of problems, a lot of 
confusion, a lot of bad management. Bad

45:41.853 --> 45:50.389
management attributed sorely to the lack of 
command attention to the problems, such as

45:41.853 --> 45:50.389
improper...
