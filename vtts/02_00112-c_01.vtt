WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:04.066
places around Italy looking.

00:04.607 --> 00:06.589
And that's where we ended up in the present place.

00:06.609 --> 00:08.191
We are in Castiglione da Florentina.

00:09.052 --> 00:13.637
And the town desperately wanted to be affiliated with the university.

00:14.878 --> 00:17.101
And so they made a really good deal.

00:18.182 --> 00:20.545
And so Sally said, sign it up.

00:20.565 --> 00:25.630
So the next year we did a floating studio between Assisi and some other places.

00:26.131 --> 00:28.814
And then the following year it was ready to live in.

00:29.334 --> 00:31.877
And then since that time, the bishops come back.

00:32.718 --> 00:36.482
and begged for A&M to come back because the place is falling apart again.

00:36.882 --> 00:38.003
It's out in the middle of nowhere.

00:38.303 --> 00:39.444
They can't rent it to anyone.

00:39.525 --> 00:40.906
They essentially cut their own throats.

00:41.967 --> 00:44.109
And so we all just went, yeah.

00:44.589 --> 00:51.736
But the College of Architecture, I think, has more students going study abroad percentage-wise than any place on campus.

00:52.657 --> 01:01.746
And I think we're the number one university in the US for sending students abroad in the College of Architecture because we have programs in Guatemala,

01:01.726 --> 01:11.436
in France, in Australia, Mexico, Barcelona, Greece, Turkey, the whole bit.

01:11.497 --> 01:14.960
So it's grown, and it's all Dan McGilvery, you know, started the whole thing.

01:16.081 --> 01:18.324
But, you know, that's really good.

01:18.364 --> 01:21.147
And Vivian Paul has a really good, you know, history of the whole thing.

01:23.810 --> 01:25.391
Let's see if I went through that.

01:25.411 --> 01:27.654
Oh, Ran Watson would be a good one to get hold of.

01:27.674 --> 01:27.754
Who?

01:27.774 --> 01:28.695
Ran Watson.

01:28.675 --> 01:39.086
He came, he's a chemist, he came the same time I did, and he was Associate Dean of Chemistry for a while, but he's been around a long time.

01:39.526 --> 01:51.419
And, let's see, Salwood Central Texas Hardware, we all remember, is the place, let's see.

01:52.140 --> 01:57.045
Oh, and Connie Jo Donaldson, there were lots of stories about him.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.663
He must have taught at A&M for 30 or more years.

02:01.965 --> 02:03.507
What was his specialty?

02:03.687 --> 02:04.308
Freehand drawing.

02:05.610 --> 02:10.957
But when I first came here, I know students, the first year he was here, he has really long legs.

02:10.977 --> 02:11.778
He's like a spider.

02:12.359 --> 02:19.168
And he was sitting on one of those stools, and he's real nervous, and his legs intertwined, and he got caught, you know, and like just fell over.

02:19.468 --> 02:22.813
And the students had to spend about 15 minutes trying to get him untangled.

02:22.793 --> 02:32.307
And then when he was first here, he was walking to the old Heaton Hall, which was the bookstore, and he always had the cigarette dangling.

02:33.008 --> 02:41.781
And he had a big open collar shirt and two core guys, freshmen came as he was holding all these books and went,

02:41.761 --> 02:42.503
Howdy, sir.

02:42.523 --> 02:56.211
You know, and it's startling because he'd never, you know, been on campus before, seen anybody in the Corps, and the sewers were flipping up and down there, you know, and started smoking, and he had to drop all of his books, you know, to undo his shirt, and, of course, they ran.

02:56.231 --> 02:58.937
But, you know, he's a good one.

02:59.498 --> 03:01.322
Did the students have a nickname for him?

03:01.302 --> 03:01.983
Connie Joe.

03:02.544 --> 03:08.954
Connie Crayons is the brand of a crayon and they called him Connie Joe Donaldson.

03:09.034 --> 03:09.915
Is it C-O-N-N-Y?

03:10.696 --> 03:15.444
I think it's C-O-N-E-E, I think.

03:15.464 --> 03:16.726
C-O-N-E-E.

03:17.968 --> 03:20.431
And then let's see, there's Doster Goswick's story.

03:20.451 --> 03:28.103
Sue worked in the health center and he would roller skate around the health center to get from one place to another.

03:29.534 --> 03:45.734
Oh and then when the health center was built they built a spot for the hyperbolic unit and then it turned out they forgot to size it or figure out how they were going to get it in and they had to tear out a wall to move it in.

03:45.774 --> 03:48.457
Oh and Dean Hannigan too was another story.

03:48.918 --> 03:50.580
When they were building Military Walk

03:51.607 --> 04:02.055
My specialty was environmental psychology and how people behave in spaces, and so there was no spot around campus for students to sit anywhere.

04:03.385 --> 04:09.995
Myself, another faculty member and two students went to meet with him because he somehow was in charge of this.

04:10.336 --> 04:22.534
So we tried to explain to him that if we could work these different seating areas out, what he had now won't work because it puts people in a goldfish bowl and they're just going to be vacant, sunken areas.

04:23.275 --> 04:27.722
And he just laughed and he said, Aggies don't want to sit around outside and chat.

04:27.702 --> 04:30.425
You know, and there's no need to have that.

04:30.665 --> 04:33.648
Besides we provide, if they want to sit, they'll sit in these type spots.

04:34.049 --> 04:36.011
Then we try to explain again and he said, nah.

04:36.511 --> 04:38.834
You know, so the next year they were built and they're still vacant.

04:39.114 --> 04:40.155
You know, nobody will sit in them.

04:40.876 --> 04:48.203
But it's just, it's almost like you're a prophet anywhere else but at A&M, you know, if you're on campus.

04:49.385 --> 04:54.570
Oh and then I remember when the battalion used to be delivered in the neighborhoods.

04:54.803 --> 04:58.006
And no longer anymore.

04:58.867 --> 05:03.411
And we had one of our gourmet dinners on the steps of the systems building.

05:05.012 --> 05:10.457
We set up tables and tablecloths and cantalaperas, and we had a dessert gourmet meal.

05:11.438 --> 05:16.263
What was the impression, what impression did you and others have of Jack Williams?

05:17.984 --> 05:18.745
We liked him.

05:19.906 --> 05:23.089
We thought he was very academic, you know, but he was here such a short time.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.383
But I think because of his credentials people liked him.

05:27.403 --> 05:27.763
Five years.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.949
So he was so dear to me.

05:31.149 --> 05:31.610
Oh, yeah.

05:31.630 --> 05:44.453
Well, when he was in the hospital I had a piece of wood that was from the panel up there and I carved a heart out for it, told him it was over Sully's and sent it to he and his wife.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.886
She still has all those things.

05:46.906 --> 05:47.707
Oh, good, good.

05:47.747 --> 05:48.088
I betcha.

05:48.729 --> 05:49.270
You betcha.

05:49.530 --> 06:00.626
Yeah, but he, you know, he seemed to be the only real president that you could call a president, and I'm sure Vandiver was, but, you know, the ag people, they seemed to be sort of a joke.

06:01.567 --> 06:05.192
Well, and see, William's experience

06:05.172 --> 06:14.540
at Clemson, and then at the coordinating board, and then being chief academic officer for the University of Tennessee System, all of that prepared him well.

06:14.821 --> 06:16.967
Oh, yeah.

06:16.987 --> 06:19.013
So, think of this.

06:19.651 --> 06:40.211
a separate land grant school in a southern state that is 100 miles from the state capitol, off the main highway, with a limited curriculum, all male, all white, compulsory military, had a corps, rah-rah school spirit, rah-rah athletics.

06:40.231 --> 06:48.139
The state university is at the state capitol and they tell Clemson jokes at that state university.

06:48.119 --> 07:03.444
And he worked his way up from a beginning faculty level in southern history to be the chief academic officer at Clemson, and he went through all the experiences there that we went through here about three years before we did.

07:03.844 --> 07:04.425
Oh, great.

07:04.545 --> 07:07.330
And that's why he would understand this place well.

07:07.350 --> 07:08.071
Yeah, yeah.

07:08.091 --> 07:12.338
So he dealt with experiment stations and extension services and all that.

07:12.554 --> 07:17.400
And I've learned from these interviews, well, I'll give you this question.

07:18.061 --> 07:22.708
Who recommended him to the board?

07:23.909 --> 07:25.031
I would think it would be Rudder.

07:25.271 --> 07:26.673
It was Rudder in 68.

07:26.733 --> 07:33.482
If something happens to me, he told Ford Allbritton and John Lindsay, if something ever happens to me, you go get him.

07:33.462 --> 07:39.653
And Albritton, then in 1970, when Rudder dies, was a new board member.

07:40.174 --> 07:52.315
And when he said, when I told the board that, they didn't have to hear anything else, if that's what Earl said to him.

07:52.295 --> 07:57.805
What are your most cherished colleagues, the ones that you respect the most?

07:58.806 --> 07:59.708
John Ferry.

08:00.129 --> 08:00.409
Why?

08:01.231 --> 08:04.236
What are the keys to his capability?

08:04.256 --> 08:06.560
He can get blood out of a turnip in a classroom.

08:07.341 --> 08:09.425
He can make students do their very best work.

08:10.427 --> 08:11.869
That's F-E-R-R-Y?

08:11.889 --> 08:15.636
F-A-I-R-E-Y.

08:17.219 --> 08:29.772
I mean, students may scream and moan and yell, but four years later, they're saying in senior design, the best work they've ever done was in his class because he wouldn't take anything less than excellent.

08:30.893 --> 08:34.978
And he could get them to expand beyond their wildest dreams.

08:35.739 --> 08:37.080
He's really good at that.

08:37.220 --> 08:39.022
Plus, he's real broad.

08:39.042 --> 08:39.823
I mean, he's a painter.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.426
He's a gardener, nationally known gardener.

08:45.389 --> 08:45.589
Excuse me.

08:45.569 --> 08:51.877
Oh, you got another one.

08:56.442 --> 08:57.704
Right.

08:57.724 --> 08:59.546
But he brings diversity to the classroom.

08:59.967 --> 09:06.455
He can talk along a whole series of lines that most faculty members can't.

09:06.655 --> 09:08.978
Most of them are single-dimensioned.

09:10.190 --> 09:10.891
And who else?

09:11.312 --> 09:12.394
Jerry Maffey, I respect.

09:13.095 --> 09:13.396
Jerry who?

09:13.416 --> 09:14.919
Maffey, M-A-F-F-E-I.

09:15.299 --> 09:16.782
He came the same time I did from Berkeley.

09:16.802 --> 09:18.966
I didn't know him at Berkeley.

09:18.986 --> 09:25.258
Dick Roman had us over for dinner one night with our wives, thinking it would be on home week, and we met for the first time there.

09:26.319 --> 09:33.733
And he's very methodical, but he also, his wife's a fabulous painter.

09:33.713 --> 09:44.554
She had a show in Chicago about six years ago, and it was a retrospect of the 60s, she and Judy Chicago and some other people, so she's high up there in level.

09:45.336 --> 09:47.039
He's an antique dealer.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.504
He sells off the internet.

09:50.406 --> 09:55.536
He's won national award for some of his designs.

09:55.516 --> 10:03.567
And he also won't take any kind of low-quality work, and he can inspire the students, and he makes them question themselves.

10:04.048 --> 10:12.520
And then Alan Stasel, you know, if there's anybody I modeled myself after, it was probably Alan.

10:12.681 --> 10:20.812
His compassion, you know, for individuals and students, his ability to, you know, see, you know, good or the development, anybody.

10:23.175 --> 10:24.257
He could...

10:25.975 --> 10:32.265
He could start talking to somebody and find out anything about them, what directions they need to go, and the whole bit.

10:32.726 --> 10:36.832
And then he would bend heaven and earth to make that happen for them.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.116
There's very few people that will do that.

10:39.597 --> 10:45.546
And even if it disagreed with what direction he wanted to go, he would try to do what was best for that person.

10:46.187 --> 10:52.557
Him I probably respect more than anybody.

10:52.537 --> 10:58.985
Outside of that, I actually ran around with more people outside the College of Architecture than inside the College of Architecture.

10:59.005 --> 11:04.031
Steve Ryder, for one, Skip Porter, a bunch of those people.

11:04.632 --> 11:05.713
Yeah, Manny Parsons.

11:06.154 --> 11:08.737
See, Steve and I were at Rice at the same time.

11:08.757 --> 11:08.997
Oh, really?

11:09.117 --> 11:10.279
But I was a graduate student.

11:10.299 --> 11:11.120
He was an undergraduate.

11:11.880 --> 11:18.088
Then here, he gets hired at UTEP 20 years ago, same summer I get hired.

11:18.068 --> 11:20.194
He's now the chief academic officer out there.

11:20.355 --> 11:21.598
Our kids knew his kids.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.948
So we've crossed a lot of paths.

11:25.791 --> 11:29.040
And then, let's see, other little funny stories.

11:30.067 --> 11:45.288
We had artists in residence for six years where the dean paid for somebody to come in and they would be there for a year and they would work in a studio and they would teach and they'd give a work of art to the college.

11:45.768 --> 11:58.926
Well, one of them was Dick Ray out of Houston and he made a, I think it was a 50-foot bra that hung across Main Street for the grand opening of the Fine Arts Museum.

11:59.665 --> 12:07.557
So anyhow, he brought it up here and was showing the classes and had the giant six-foot clothespins and all sorts of things.

12:07.618 --> 12:13.306
So anyhow, several of the students thought this would look good on top of the academic building.

12:14.128 --> 12:20.037
So they went running over and somehow got out and wrapped

12:20.118 --> 12:29.655
And there's a picture in one of the battalions, or in the alumna magazine, not alumna, in the Aggieland of the bra around it.

12:30.757 --> 12:32.360
And they were arrested for that.

12:32.841 --> 12:38.110
And then he also helped, this was during the streaking era, remember that?

12:38.461 --> 12:43.447
He led a bunch of the architecture students when they were over in the old hospital, you know, streaking around the campus.

12:45.950 --> 13:03.372
And then Mad Max Griner, he painted the dumpster, he's a really good painter, but he painted this large chicken with core boots on, you know, and a core hat on the dumpster, which was neat, it somehow disappeared.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.323
Let's see.

13:07.343 --> 13:14.075
Oh, before there was theater here, we had a melodrama.

13:14.636 --> 13:15.598
I don't know if you remember that.

13:15.638 --> 13:19.605
It was over at the Huey's house, which was over near Belly Goat Park.

13:20.125 --> 13:38.674
and we invited 500 people, and it was all faculty cast, and we all played different roles, set up the backdrops, the sets, and we had popcorn and beer out, and then produced our own melodrama, and that was probably around 74, somewhere in there.

13:40.096 --> 13:40.817
But that was fun.

13:42.260 --> 13:46.386
And then architects on the faculty couldn't practice.

13:46.366 --> 13:59.920
within the community without them phoning the legislature and da-da-da-da until about the late 70s when there got to be enough business that we really weren't taking business away.

14:02.043 --> 14:18.297
Let's see, are there any, I'm using the phrase broadly now, former students, any former students, non-A&M employees that have been significant in the progress of the College of Architecture?

14:19.057 --> 14:23.101
Are there some people that... Well, Ron Skaggs, which is fairly obvious.

14:23.561 --> 14:31.408
He's president of the American Institute of Architects nationally now, and he's president of HKS in Dallas.

14:31.388 --> 14:34.956
How has he helped the college?

14:34.976 --> 14:43.837
Well, he set up an endowed professorship, several scholarships, things like that for the College of Architecture.

14:44.579 --> 14:50.072
And then he's always been, you know, just a major supporter when we needed things.

14:51.470 --> 14:58.039
He's, you know, there's been several exceptional, you know, students like Robert Riggs who was.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.403
You're saying by his accomplishments he helped.

15:01.423 --> 15:02.404
Yeah, by his accomplishments.

15:02.444 --> 15:06.590
Did the CRS firm, have they been helpful?

15:06.990 --> 15:07.631
Yeah.

15:07.651 --> 15:17.123
They set up the Vis Lab and then set up the CRS Center for Entrepreneurship that Bob Johnson's head of right now.

15:17.524 --> 15:21.409
Am I correct that the CRS firm started

15:21.389 --> 15:23.815
when they were here.

15:25.199 --> 15:27.906
And they used to office over Maidleys?

15:27.986 --> 15:29.290
That's what I thought at Southgate.

15:31.756 --> 15:36.208
Do you know of any instances when some true outsider

15:36.762 --> 15:44.031
former student, legislator, regent, or somebody else, attempted to give direction of what architecture should or should not do?

15:44.452 --> 15:45.853
Yeah.

15:45.873 --> 15:46.294
Dallas.

15:47.275 --> 15:48.276
Not Dallas, Fort Worth.

15:49.458 --> 15:50.039
Pete Peterson?

15:50.639 --> 15:51.060
Hmm?

15:51.080 --> 15:51.761
Pete Peterson?

15:53.243 --> 16:01.673
He, yeah, he was one, but there was another one, seemed like it was, his son was the legislature.

16:03.256 --> 16:14.731
It seemed like his son was named Pete or Bud or something like that, but it seemed like it started with a D. But he was a big—Garrett, Preston Garrett.

16:14.751 --> 16:22.041
He came in, and he didn't like the idea of us branching out of being a boutique school of architecture.

16:22.021 --> 16:27.508
He didn't like the idea of research, you know, and planning should be in some other school.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.491
And he tried to dictate.

16:30.992 --> 16:39.863
Harwood K. Smith tried to dictate that too, which surprised me because Harwood, being an artist, you know, should be broader than that.

16:40.283 --> 16:43.567
But Harwood did set us up with the Guatemala study abroad program.

16:43.687 --> 16:47.472
I have to give him credit for that.

16:47.452 --> 16:48.654
Who else was it?

16:49.054 --> 16:50.716
Oh, D.D.

16:50.756 --> 16:51.698
Matthews here in town.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.163
He didn't like anything that any of us did.

16:57.045 --> 17:00.769
But I think the biggest pain in the ass, well, D.D.

17:00.809 --> 17:09.140
Matthews and the guy from Fort Worth.

17:09.741 --> 17:15.028
What is it that, what are the ingredients in good teaching?

17:16.696 --> 17:18.919
Ah, okay.

17:19.119 --> 17:22.424
You've been highly recognized as a good teacher.

17:22.704 --> 17:34.440
To me it's like, the analogy I might use is if you have two pendulum clocks on a metal piece and you set them going opposite directions, they will eventually oscillate to the same frequency.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.443
Like a really good teacher.

17:38.009 --> 17:45.199
tunes in with an individual student that way and finds out where the student is, not where the student finds out where the prof is.

17:45.961 --> 17:53.151
And then you start opening up doors for them and showing them how they can do things better or how they can become better or how they can grow.

17:53.872 --> 17:57.317
So it's essentially sort of

17:57.297 --> 18:06.820
It's how much growth you can achieve in your student is, I think, a good prof. I don't think there's an ego for the prof involved.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.750
I think the prof has to almost become egoless to make that happen.

18:11.168 --> 18:15.116
What about pride in what that teacher is trying to teach?

18:16.058 --> 18:18.303
Yeah, you have to be enthusiastic.

18:18.323 --> 18:19.886
You have to believe in what you're trying to teach.

18:21.389 --> 18:21.830
Patience?

18:22.431 --> 18:23.975
Oh, definitely patience.

18:23.995 --> 18:29.987
Yeah, because you're going to see some kids, you know, that will try and try and try again.

18:29.967 --> 18:34.214
And, you know, I might have seen them go out of my class, you know, clueless.

18:34.975 --> 18:42.347
And then about a year or two later, all of a sudden they turn around and they come back and say, that's what you were trying to do.

18:42.367 --> 18:46.494
And it dawns on them, but it just takes that long for it to gel, you know, and come to the surface.

18:47.055 --> 18:48.938
And there's a lot of incubation.

18:48.918 --> 19:03.568
that's involved with a lot of students and students that you think you know hate you and then two years later they say you know you turn my life around uh which is kind of fun did you ever think about leaving here

19:04.662 --> 19:05.803
Not really, no.

19:06.224 --> 19:26.130
I kind of got hooked in right off the bat and I guess my house became sort of home room for, you know, the college's kids and it was a half a block from campus and half the time they'd come in, you know, anywhere from 6 to 9 at night and just sit around and chat.

19:26.785 --> 19:31.712
Normally did you walk to the architecture building or did you drive?

19:33.275 --> 19:34.737
I probably drove more than I walked.

19:38.382 --> 19:42.448
So that you never got any formal offer or sought a formal offer?

19:42.509 --> 19:43.911
Nobody ever tried to lure you?

19:44.311 --> 19:45.934
Did anybody ever try to lure you away?

19:46.074 --> 19:47.416
Yeah, Auburn's trying to get me now.

19:47.496 --> 19:50.160
Oh, really?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.821
Oh, Buffalo, New York.

19:53.841 --> 19:54.602
Tried last year.

19:56.284 --> 20:01.450
But anyone that has asked me, Tech has tried three times.

20:03.613 --> 20:05.996
So, but I don't see any reason to leave.

20:06.056 --> 20:06.657
It's a problem.

20:06.977 --> 20:12.324
So your Red Raider blood cells have been turned... Replaced.

20:12.364 --> 20:13.806
They've been replaced with maroon.

20:14.106 --> 20:14.427
Right.

20:14.507 --> 20:15.388
Yeah, I mean, there's...

20:15.368 --> 20:17.932
I don't like to be an administrator that much.

20:18.112 --> 20:19.013
I enjoy the students.

20:19.614 --> 20:28.447
And if I went to be a dean, that would put me out of the classroom, and then I'd just have to meet with a bunch of administrators all day, and that wouldn't be any fun.

20:30.450 --> 20:43.890
Do you feel that the program in here, and I'm using architecture now in general, have there been any important opportunities missed in the last quarter of a century or third of a century?

20:46.368 --> 21:09.979
There were probably some faculty hires had they paid more attention to that this like this last summer when Julius Garbo went to Utah I mean UTSA he was so busy interviewing around there were six faculty positions that they had spent megabucks flying people in and he essentially the faculty thought he was handling getting them in

21:09.959 --> 21:15.308
And he was so busy making arrangements, selling his house, he didn't phone any of them.

21:16.109 --> 21:20.596
And so by the time they figured out that he hadn't done anything and they phoned him, they'd taken jobs elsewhere.

21:21.658 --> 21:29.571
But I would say... Have you missed any opportunities in the program's development?

21:31.373 --> 21:37.785
It could have, the computer stuff could have developed earlier if it hadn't been for Reed and Hicks.

21:38.527 --> 21:39.188
It could have happened.

21:41.051 --> 21:45.640
McCarthy made it happen, but we're still number one in the world in that area.

21:46.482 --> 21:48.285
But it could have happened a lot earlier.

21:48.265 --> 21:54.352
Are there some, are there some innovations that we ought to be doing more of now?

21:54.552 --> 21:58.457
Yeah, we should be getting into the design bill, more like your son is in.

22:02.742 --> 22:05.546
And more management style stuff.

22:05.766 --> 22:09.670
A lot of the old architects on the faculty, not old, I mean, these are young people.

22:10.652 --> 22:11.493
You mean old style?

22:11.533 --> 22:12.274
Old style.

22:14.096 --> 22:16.078
They're still looking at the boutique school.

22:19.417 --> 22:22.223
and saying we want to be like Harvard, we want to be like this and the other.

22:22.944 --> 22:28.015
And the whole industry is going toward land development and design-build.

22:28.836 --> 22:37.595
And architects need to be managers, not hired, you know, decorators, you know, for the design-build firms.

22:37.935 --> 22:40.260
And if we don't hop on that boat,

22:40.730 --> 22:51.760
We're going to get left out in the coal and we need to be the leaders in it, training them both in both areas and not just hiding our head in the sand just because it's unpopular, design was, to do so.

22:53.221 --> 23:01.509
Let's make believe that you were hired as a consultant now to the leadership in the College of Architecture.

23:02.270 --> 23:07.935
What advice would you give them for now and the future?

23:09.350 --> 23:13.676
Well, I would hop on the design bill for sure and on a management option.

23:15.578 --> 23:18.542
They've gotten a little tight over the last two years since Walter left.

23:19.163 --> 23:28.135
Once Walter left, who kept everything open and multi-directional, some of the old-style thinking architects.

23:28.115 --> 23:34.102
have ventured a little bit back to more, you know, this is architecture, you know, this is the way it should be.

23:35.023 --> 23:41.171
And they have their head in the sand, I think, a little bit too much in that direction.

23:41.211 --> 23:55.388
It's still broader than 98% of all the schools of architecture in the country, you know, and I don't think it'll ever swing the pendulum to the right on that again.

23:55.368 --> 24:03.947
I would go in with the Visual Studies Undergraduate curriculum where we have the first electronic arts program in the U.S.

24:04.649 --> 24:12.988
and we already have a world-renowned graduate program in it and the only problem with doing that is that

24:12.968 --> 24:17.696
A third of all the students coming here in environmental design want to go that route.

24:18.577 --> 24:28.113
And since we have a cap and we're only taking the top students, well, the people that want to go this are the people that also have to pass engineering calculus and all that.

24:28.133 --> 24:34.403
So there's going to be a greater percentage of them admitted into the program than there is architecture or anything.

24:34.383 --> 24:47.315
I don't mention that to them because I know that's going to happen, but if any of the architects and construction science people ever realized that, they would probably try to put a stop to the visual stage program because it would become the largest department.

24:48.036 --> 25:01.048
And plus it sure would help A&Ms, you know, image around the country to have an earth, I mean, a world-renowned, you know, pace-setting, you know, undergraduate electronic arts program.

25:01.670 --> 25:08.181
In terms of dimensions of number of students and so forth, what advice would you give?

25:08.602 --> 25:12.668
How large should the program, should architecture in general be?

25:13.630 --> 25:17.617
Right now, they're at a pretty good size that they can handle.

25:18.358 --> 25:22.605
If they put in the visual studies program, they need to get bigger.

25:24.909 --> 25:26.091
They need more space.

25:26.071 --> 25:32.124
Within that framework they have, it would be almost impossible to have a visual stage program.

25:32.585 --> 25:44.451
They need some place like Scotes Hall or some similar sized building that they could branch into, that they could create studio space and stuff like that.

25:44.431 --> 25:47.475
All right, now I've just about run out of questions I can think of.

25:47.495 --> 25:48.417
Can you think of any other?

25:48.457 --> 25:50.419
I've gone through pretty much everything.

25:50.439 --> 25:50.720
All right.

25:50.740 --> 25:52.562
Okay, then I've got two questions left.

25:53.464 --> 25:58.451
Let's make believe that somebody walks up to you and gives you a check for a million dollars with one condition.

25:59.252 --> 26:02.196
You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you can decide what.

26:03.358 --> 26:10.067
If you could make a huge gift to A&M, for what purpose would you want that gift used?

26:10.047 --> 26:13.810
the development of the visual studies curriculum.

26:13.830 --> 26:23.920
The second one would be, if I had an alternative, was the Center for, I'm not sure what they're going to call it, creative leadership through educational psychology.

26:24.620 --> 26:37.472
They're working with the vice president of Conoco right now, and he's not married, and he and his wife, he was responsible for all the creative ventures of Conoco in the last 20 years, and

26:39.663 --> 27:02.937
He has already approached, and we've already had a couple, three lunches with him, and he's going to donate money to set up a center for creative leadership or creativity at A&M campus, and it'll be handled through educational psychology, and they'll do sort of a cross-campus interdisciplinary curriculum, and then my freshman class will be one of the

27:02.917 --> 27:10.752
courses in it, but to me that would be a neat second thing if it had to be something out of the College of Architecture.

27:11.774 --> 27:13.056
All right, then the last question.

27:13.617 --> 27:16.503
What feelings do you have in your heart for Texas A&M today?

27:17.545 --> 27:22.815
Well, I've turned down all the offers to go elsewhere.

27:22.795 --> 27:23.917
You know, to me, it's home.

27:25.721 --> 27:28.487
I can't think of going anywhere else.

27:29.509 --> 27:31.553
I've been able to accomplish everything I want to here.

27:32.715 --> 27:35.481
And there doesn't seem to be any end in sight.

27:36.463 --> 27:42.134
So, you know, I think if I come up with some new ideas or directions, so far I've been supported all the way.

27:42.194 --> 27:42.475
So...

27:43.822 --> 27:45.103
And I like the students here.

27:45.764 --> 27:53.271
They have a different kind of attitude, a can-do attitude that very few other colleges around.

27:53.291 --> 28:01.478
When I was at Berkeley, most of the students out there thought they were owed an education and that if they went to class, they were doing the prof a favor.

28:02.659 --> 28:04.781
And here, it's the opposite.

28:04.841 --> 28:07.183
You know, it's like, you know, what can I learn?

28:07.243 --> 28:08.124
How much can I learn?

28:10.546 --> 28:12.428
It's just a different mindset.

28:13.640 --> 28:14.353
Splendid.
