WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:08.863
Well,

00:01.735 --> 00:08.863
what is your name? Arnulfa Martinez de Medina. 
Again, Arnulfa Martinez de Medina. And where were

00:19.795 --> 00:21.196
you born? In the city of Camargo. In 1995. 1995. 
1895.

00:31.655 --> 00:33.457
Yes, 895. And when did you come here to Texas? We 
came in 1913. Well, tell

00:39.964 --> 01:01.408
me, please, these things about the story of your 
life in the days when you were a girl in Camargo.

01:02.080 --> 01:09.051
When you were a child in Comarga, tell me about your 
life. For example, what was your father's name? My

01:12.476 --> 01:26.438
father's name was Romaldo Martínez and my 
mother's name was Arnulfa

01:12.476 --> 01:26.438
Olivares.

01:26.458 --> 01:28.341
He died in 1898.

01:32.067 --> 01:35.511
Yes, he died, my father. My mother had four 
children, his children, well married. And then he

01:40.437 --> 01:52.971
got married again in 1900, with another man named 
Macedonio Carrera. And he had many children, I

01:53.031 --> 01:58.117
still have my brothers. And what else do I want? 
What kind of work did your father have? My father

02:05.701 --> 02:08.084
was a farmer. He was a capitalist. That's what they 
say in my register. My father was a capitalist. He

02:14.974 --> 02:16.577
lived in his capital. That's what they say in my 
register, where he registered

02:18.219 --> 02:25.169
me with his mother. And the second wife of your 
mother? The second, yes, she lived with the

02:27.672 --> 02:30.617
capital. Also? Also. Capital of what? Small 
cattle, they call it cabras. Oh, cabras. Cabras.

02:41.443 --> 02:43.084
Did they have a lot of land? Well, maybe they did, so 
they had a lot of capital. It was very extensive,

02:47.989 --> 02:50.832
the Mexican land. In wintertime, the cattlemen 
would go to the mountains where there was a refuge

02:50.952 --> 03:00.782
for the animals, far away. What kind of house did 
you have?

03:08.362 --> 03:10.045
A good house. Yes. With adobe. So we used adobe. 
Yes. From Soquete. The painting to make the

03:18.358 --> 03:20.322
houses. Very good house we had. With patio? Yes. 
With fruit trees? Yes. In the city of Camargo? In

03:30.557 --> 03:32.980
the city of Camargo. And how many people lived 
there in the city of Camargo in those days? Many,

03:38.665 --> 03:40.047
many. And then, for what reason did your family 
come to Atenas? Why did we come? Yes. Because of the

03:52.740 --> 03:54.141
war in the Camargo. Well, tell me about the war. 
Well, I told them. I told the people that they were

03:57.916 --> 04:01.761
very messy and that they did many bad things. And 
some of them would do them, maybe. But my parents,

04:05.226 --> 04:12.194
out of fear, dad, my brothers Martínez, who were 
two men, they were already men, not men, but young

04:05.226 --> 04:12.194
boys. And out of fear that they were going to go to 
war, they came here with all the cattle that was

04:12.294 --> 04:18.502
left. And we left the house and everything there. 
And we came here. How many people came? A lot.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.264
Almost all of Camargo came. Almost all of the town? 
Yes. After that, some came, and others have come

04:33.968 --> 04:39.214
now from out there, foreign. We tell them that they 
are from outside, foreign. But some returned to

04:42.739 --> 04:44.441
their homes. We didn't, because Dad didn't leave. 
Because here he thought about living, making a

04:48.005 --> 04:50.368
living. I bought some mules and a guayín, I bought a 
car and a bunch of beasts so that my brothers and

04:50.602 --> 05:00.676
sisters

04:50.602 --> 05:00.676
could work. And then they all grew up, my brothers 
and sisters. I have a brother who has a very strong

05:02.679 --> 05:09.368
store, very big, very good prices, with good 
possessions. My brothers and sisters are not very

05:09.408 --> 05:11.931
popular. I still have three brothers and sisters, 
men and two women. And we all have good houses to

05:18.597 --> 05:21.781
live in. We are not under huts that serve us. We are 
under... I am a mother, under a good environment.

05:32.953 --> 05:38.499
Why didn't you go back to Camargo after the 
revolution? Because they started working here

05:38.519 --> 05:41.663
and we made a living here. I got married here 
because I was the first and we all got married, we

05:42.524 --> 05:48.030
all got married. What year did you get married? I 
got married in 1918. During the revolution? No, I

05:59.265 --> 06:01.128
think it was over. There were a lot of foreign 
troops and they were very bad. The troops

06:08.101 --> 06:11.908
were bad. My father didn't want to come here. My 
father paid the expense. I didn't know my father. I

06:20.271 --> 06:22.874
can't remember him. But my father didn't want to 
come here. He had a lot of corn. And they had stored

06:28.020 --> 06:31.663
it in a room to use it. And the bad revolutionaries 
came, I told them. Because some came and others

06:35.287 --> 06:37.770
didn't. And they never left the Pacific. And I 
didn't want to say that... Well, the little man,

06:41.943 --> 06:45.666
right? And then they made him run over, or they ran 
over him, and he said, I don't have any more wine

06:45.686 --> 06:53.953
left. And we thought, the revolution lasted 14 
years. 14 years? 14 years it lasted. Oh, how hard.

06:59.258 --> 07:06.604
That's why we made deposits here, and of housing, 
and of everything, because that's how we liked it.

07:06.624 --> 07:10.668
We didn't like to go from house to land. Yes.

07:16.148 --> 07:42.443
Well,

07:45.275 --> 08:11.890
What

07:45.275 --> 08:11.890
type of history

07:45.275 --> 08:11.890
are you mainly

07:45.275 --> 08:11.890
interested in?

08:12.511 --> 08:15.538
Well, I'm interested mainly in... Are you a 
history major? No. After

08:16.540 --> 08:25.320
my grandfather died, he was coming to practice. 
Uh-huh. And that grandfather and father, when

08:28.070 --> 08:34.102
they came over, they always had the intention to go 
back. They had no intention to stay here. But they

08:37.149 --> 08:40.415
never went back, you know, because everybody was 
born here and grew up here. They didn't want to go

08:40.435 --> 08:42.239
back. Uh-huh. Well, she just told me that one 
reason that they didn't go back is that, you know,

08:42.420 --> 08:48.492
they all got married here. And then she married an 
American citizen, my father. And at that time, I

08:53.813 --> 09:03.951
don't know if you were familiar with, the law was 
that if a woman married a foreigner, she would

08:53.813 --> 09:03.951
become a citizen of that country. It used to be that 
they changed the women's living order. They

09:07.116 --> 09:07.897
changed that. So she became an American citizen By 
marriage. By just marriage. And she didn't know

09:15.988 --> 09:28.497
until about 20 or 30 years later that she was in a 
pregnancy. . Actually, on my father's side,

09:30.355 --> 09:56.093
they were all He probably was born here in this 
state in 1865. And after

09:59.568 --> 10:07.677
the Mexican-American War, they took all this 
land. Why don't you leave your chair up close so I

10:07.997 --> 10:10.760
can pick you up? And the people, you know, these 
people that had lived here even before they were,

10:10.820 --> 10:16.326
they were part of Mexico. And the United States 
took all this land. And these people remain here

10:19.449 --> 10:23.734
anyway. My father grew up in this area, even though 
it was U.S. territory. But the people that lived

10:30.711 --> 10:35.457
here at that time, they still used Mexican 
currency. It was just like living in Mexico as far

10:36.199 --> 10:40.485
as they were concerned. So there were lots of 
connections between, was there a lot of contact

10:40.545 --> 10:49.097
back and forth across the river? There was no such 
thing as immigration. Immigration officers.

11:00.920 --> 11:09.072
See,

11:00.920 --> 11:09.072
the wealth at that time was to have goats or sheep. 
They were pretty well off if you had that capital.

11:12.998 --> 11:14.420
And he crossed with everything. And that's what 
she's saying. He had to get Oh, when they crossed

11:16.972 --> 11:20.399
during the revolution? That's right. They 
brought everything. Was it easy to get the

11:23.846 --> 11:25.429
permission? ¿Estaba fácil para obtener esta 
permisión de aduanas? ¿De cruzar con todos los

11:29.778 --> 11:31.160
animales? Sí, sí. Eso era muy, muy gratis todo. No 
cobraron. Ah, no problema. No. Sí. They

11:40.090 --> 11:53.949
were

11:40.090 --> 11:53.949
very well off, you know, in that type of standard. 
My grandfather, my real grandfather, my real one,

11:53.989 --> 11:58.496
because she remarried. Right. And was very well to 
do, you know. He developed quite a bit of capital

12:04.304 --> 12:08.950
when he died. It's funny because at that time, if 
you owned a horse and had a gun, you were pretty

12:09.250 --> 12:18.299
well-to-do. Just like having a Cadillac 
nowadays. You got a car. When did your family move

12:24.708 --> 12:27.992
into this part of Texas? You say your father was 
born in 1865? In Tabasco. My grandfather was born

12:33.058 --> 12:36.121
in 1865. No, your grandfather was from Rancho El 
Azucar. No, but he was an American citizen. He was

12:45.192 --> 12:47.354
an American citizen. He was born in Yes, but in 
1865, when did the United States take over this

12:48.232 --> 12:53.662
land? 1845. 1845. Was he born in 1865 or was he born 
in 1840?

13:06.847 --> 13:10.273
See, he died. My father was born in 1883. And his 
father died when he was a little boy. So that means

13:16.702 --> 13:23.672
he was in his mid-40s. And my father was... So that 
was 1893. And he was about 45. Actually, he

13:31.002 --> 13:37.071
probably was born closer to that 1845 era. So it's 
possible. See, when the Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty

13:38.975 --> 13:54.292
said that if you lived in this area that they had 
taken over, you could either remain here and

13:38.975 --> 13:54.292
become an American citizen and retain all rights, 
or you could go back to Mexico. You had a choice. So I

13:55.974 --> 13:57.596
think that's probably what happened. They just 
stayed here. And by virtue of taking over this

13:58.797 --> 14:03.683
land, you became an American citizen. I was 
wondering when his forebearers, they must have

14:04.253 --> 14:08.998
been among the fairly early colonists of the 
region. Very, very early. His father, my... Your

14:11.701 --> 14:12.982
great-grandfather. Do you know about your 
great-grandfather? We know his name. What was his

14:15.785 --> 14:16.466
name? He was probably more Indian than Spanish. 
What was his name? Benigno. No, Benigno was the

14:21.811 --> 14:23.793
father of Apollonio. My great-grandfather was 
named Apollonio Medina. Apollonio Medina.

14:30.060 --> 14:30.841
Apollonio. Do you remember his name? And

14:33.768 --> 14:41.899
my grandfather was Benigno, which I had a brother. 
What makes you think he was more Indian than

14:42.620 --> 14:45.023
Spanish? Because my father used to say that he 
remembered him as just like an Indian, the way that

14:45.043 --> 14:57.399
he was, barefooted and dressed in long hair. So he 
would say he was just like an Indian.

15:05.307 --> 15:12.395
And then my grandfather became very well-to-do 
because they were cattlemen. This is on your

15:12.756 --> 15:14.097
father's side. My father's side. They were 
raising cattle. Now, on your mother's side, they

15:15.759 --> 15:17.541
were raising goats. Right. Right. And they were 
all, from my grandfather and all his

15:19.383 --> 15:23.948
brother-in-laws, they were all cattlemen. They 
used to, my grandfather used to, when they'd have

15:23.988 --> 15:29.915
these drives to Kansas, they'd bring beef on them. 
He used to be a trail driver. That was his job. Tell

15:35.125 --> 15:36.046
me something. Before that, before the Kansas 
drives, did they ever drive the cattle south to

15:37.047 --> 15:41.511
Mexico? Back to the markets? Well, I'll bet you 
anything they did, because I've got some

15:44.034 --> 15:51.081
documentation on cattle drives as far south as San 
Luis Potosi going back to the 18th century. This is

15:51.341 --> 15:56.006
what's interesting is, you know, I wonder, where 
did my grandfather learn this trade? He learned

15:56.346 --> 16:02.432
this trade because they were driving, from 1750 
on, they were driving cattle Five and six hundred

16:02.581 --> 16:08.168
miles south of the Perilla Market in central 
Mexico. I've just found this out, and I'm really

16:08.488 --> 16:11.873
excited about it. All the brothers-in-law of my 
father were experts. They were experts as far as

16:15.878 --> 16:18.441
that business was concerned. So they had to learn 
it, like you say. It's obvious that that's how it

16:20.123 --> 16:22.166
is. They already knew how to do it. They didn't 
learn it here. And the Anglos didn't invent it. No.

16:32.062 --> 16:38.347
It was already going on, and so really what seems to 
have happened is the direction of the drives

16:32.062 --> 16:38.347
changed. And then eventually they took over. It's 
just like

16:45.213 --> 16:53.461
on that Guadalupe Treaty, we seem to have 
forgotten it. I live in Virginia. There's not very

16:56.203 --> 17:01.387
many Spanish-speaking people down there. Not 
very many. Very few. According to the treaties,

17:03.044 --> 17:14.136
you know, these people that remain here, it said 
that they could retain, if they had land, if they

17:03.044 --> 17:14.136
had land, they could retain title to their land. 
They could retain their own language and their own

17:14.797 --> 17:18.141
customs and their own religion. This was, you 
know, guaranteed. And, of course, see, now we run

17:19.943 --> 17:29.153
into the problem that, like, when I went to school 
here, it was against regulations to speak

17:19.943 --> 17:29.153
Spanish. Against regulations? In the school 
grounds. And it's understandable why. I can

17:33.197 --> 17:34.238
understand why. But it's still against what was 
first understood. Well, tell me, have they

17:42.266 --> 17:49.934
brought in the bilingual education program here 
where you should be learning both languages from

17:42.266 --> 17:49.934
first grade on? Here in Texas, I'm not very 
familiar, but I just read a book recently. The

17:54.619 --> 18:00.085
Constitution of New Mexico was set up where the 
school systems were to be set up bilingual and to be

18:00.605 --> 18:07.593
taught by people that could speak both languages, 
which of course wasn't done. That's why, you know

18:08.675 --> 18:11.078
who Reyes Tijerina is? He's been raised in hell, 
but then he's in jail. But, of course, he wants his

18:15.203 --> 18:17.926
land back. He says it's theirs. But he ain't gonna 
get it back. He says that... The Jews got their land

18:25.748 --> 18:29.072
back in Palestine. This is my brother-in-law. I'm 
Mary Lee Nolan from College Station. How's

18:37.801 --> 18:41.585
everything up there? Fine, fine. You can say that 
here. Over there? Yes, it's hot up there, but it's

18:47.111 --> 18:51.937
just as hot here. It's hotter here because of the 
dust. He says that the Jews got back their land.

19:00.045 --> 19:06.497
They felt that they'd been there for centuries and 
centuries, and there's no law to take it away from

19:00.045 --> 19:06.497
them. And we supported him. Eric said, we should 
get the land back. And he said, well, why can't we

19:10.564 --> 19:15.533
get ours?

19:15.817 --> 19:21.264
He probably, I'd love to see his flames. He says 
he's had them. I've never seen them. He may have

19:24.268 --> 19:27.212
them because there was a lot of slicky business. 
Yeah, with the Santa Fe ring and all that. He's

19:29.575 --> 19:31.617
mainly in New Mexico. He's very radical. He's an 
extremist, I think. But sometimes, you know,

19:36.884 --> 19:40.268
that's what he thinks. If you have people that are 
too peaceful, you ain't going to get anything

19:40.288 --> 19:43.513
done. That's what he thought. I've got a friend 
here, and I

19:46.242 --> 20:12.857
haven't seen him in years, because I haven't lived 
here in 10 years, that his grandparents, all his

19:46.242 --> 20:12.857
grandparents, I don't remember which, they came 
from Spain originally. They had a grant from the

20:12.989 --> 20:21.179
king of Spain, giving them, I've forgotten how 
many, thousands of acres, 25, 30,000, 50,000. So

20:22.500 --> 20:33.794
when this happened, So when it changed, the land 
changed, the U.S. government was good enough

20:22.500 --> 20:33.794
about it that they retained title to their land. 
They didn't lose it. Like in California, all these

20:34.455 --> 20:36.878
people lost it. They had the Russian, they didn't 
have it in Texas. So they still have about 25,000

20:39.348 --> 20:42.857
acres right now. They still retain their title. 
But it'd be interesting, I don't know how much he

20:46.646 --> 20:56.530
knows to see how and where his grandparents were, 
his great-grandparents when this changes. A lot

20:57.117 --> 21:04.524
of the people I know in Zapata and Webb counties, 
most of the titles were respected. Now, I don't

21:04.844 --> 21:14.113
know how it was down here and on down toward 
Brownsville, but I've looked at a lot of the court

21:04.844 --> 21:14.113
records in Webb and Zapata. Now, a lot of people, 
one thing that happened to the lands is that the

21:14.153 --> 21:24.323
titles would come into controversy and lawyers 
would clear it up and get a good copy. for clearing

21:25.028 --> 21:45.349
the tides,

21:25.028 --> 21:45.349
but the tides

21:25.028 --> 21:45.349
were ultimately respected in

21:25.028 --> 21:45.349
that area. And where were they from? Where did they 
come from? From Camargo. They were from Camargo

21:50.515 --> 21:52.177
too? Yes. And they came here during the 
revolution? Yes. So they lived, it was the same

21:55.681 --> 21:58.324
thing, they just crossed the river. And why did 
they have their lands here? Because they lived in

22:01.667 --> 22:04.510
Camargo. Actually it was all Mexico. They had an 
agreement, the lands from here, They used to bring

22:11.992 --> 22:34.995
their cows across the river, depending

22:11.992 --> 22:34.995
on where it was better grazed. So they actually, on 
your father's side, they lived in Camargo part of

22:35.127 --> 22:41.279
the time and raised their cattle. Let me see. Papá 
nunca vivió en Camargo, ¿no? ¿Tu papá? Ellos

22:45.767 --> 22:47.711
siempre vivieron acá en La Joya. Sí, tu papá no 
vivió nunca aquí. Ni nosotros hasta que no nos

22:49.915 --> 22:51.718
venimos. See, actually, my father always was on 
this side of the river. But on your mother's side,

22:55.021 --> 22:59.168
they would bring their cattle back and forth 
across the river. Do you have land here on this side

22:59.188 --> 23:02.835
as well? Yes, also. A lot of land? A lot, a lot of 
things. How many hectares? How many acres? No, I

23:10.148 --> 23:11.430
can't tell you. It's just that there were a lot. A 
lot? I can't tell you because my people... They

23:16.741 --> 23:18.863
didn't work with them. My family wasn't working 
with them. They worked on their own. Only on their

23:21.926 --> 23:22.746
own. Your father? Your father was Martínez, 
right? Yes, that's why I called him Martínez. And

23:29.953 --> 23:32.475
he wasn't from Camargo originally. No. Your 
father was. Your father was? The one who was was my

23:35.058 --> 23:39.341
grandfather, Miguel Martínez. He was from China. 
From China. My grandfather. Your grandfather.

23:43.826 --> 23:44.026
Let's see. No, my grandfather was Miguel. He was my 
grandfather. mis abuelos it goes so far back it's

23:46.829 --> 24:13.647
just

23:46.829 --> 24:13.647
like uh first cousin she's from mexico and they 
used to own a lot of land they used to have you know

23:46.829 --> 24:13.647
acres and acres and when all this changed and all 
this you know some people took over anyway she was

24:13.998 --> 24:19.469
Just recently, she was trying to get the land back, 
but we didn't have any records. She went through

24:19.609 --> 24:21.953
all the records in Mexico. This is land in Mexico 
she was trying to get back. Yeah, well, the

24:26.061 --> 24:29.768
revolution kind of took care of a lot of that. And 
they just couldn't get the land back.

24:37.150 --> 24:44.361
I'd like to know more about how the decision was 
made to actually move over here to this side of the

24:37.150 --> 24:44.361
border. ¿Quién decidió? ¿Papá no nos decidió 
venirse para acá? Pues el temor nos hizo venirnos.

24:51.192 --> 24:52.994
¿Pero quién hizo la decisión? Pues papá y mamá. 
Pues papá y mamá. En la noche llegaron los primeros

24:57.021 --> 25:01.167
tropas. And they were destroying, shooting, and 
scaring people in the streets. And they took the

25:04.830 --> 25:07.573
horses too, right? Yes, the horses, they took 
everything. Animals, I don't tell you, corn,

25:10.415 --> 25:16.362
everything that was destroyed, they threw 
everything at the animals, just like that. And all

25:16.462 --> 25:18.084
the things from your house too? They would take 
everything. No, no, the houses. They wouldn't

25:20.626 --> 25:21.547
take the houses? Well, yes, but later, yes. Well, 
yes, later, yes. That's why they left. Because the

25:24.891 --> 25:26.192
other day we woke up here. It was a complete

25:26.510 --> 25:44.997
evacuation

25:26.510 --> 25:44.997
because my grandmother's brothers, they all 
lived here. They were olivares. And this was in

25:46.860 --> 25:55.673
1913.

25:55.838 --> 25:57.840
That was in 1913? 1913? 1913, in May. In May of 1913? 
Yes, in May of 1913. And who are the bad troops from?

26:05.629 --> 26:06.690
From Carranza? From all of them. Some came and 
others went with other names and other names like

26:09.593 --> 26:13.878
that. Many, many, and it's not important from 
whom. And in Camargo, are there sides in the

26:19.324 --> 26:22.948
revolution? How do you say it? How would you say, 
were they on either side? Did they have any

26:30.893 --> 26:32.596
political... I know what you're trying to say. I 
think I know the answer, but I don't know. It's

26:37.463 --> 26:40.067
something that's been a question in my mind 
always. Because I used to tell my grandfather, if I

26:40.588 --> 26:45.235
were a baby, I wouldn't have left. I would have 
fought there. I would have made my stand. Who would

26:48.191 --> 26:50.014
you have fought for? For myself, for my land. For 
your own land, right there. But you would have been

26:53.298 --> 26:55.020
a non-combatant. Right, I would have lost. In 
defense of, you wouldn't have been, you'd have

26:56.322 --> 26:58.505
lost. But I wouldn't have died, but I wouldn't have 
died. There were many names of those who came. And

27:04.352 --> 27:08.198
you, I mean, the whole revolution is your 
strength. And you didn't have any interest in who

27:08.278 --> 27:10.781
won? No. See, this is what I never could 
understand, but I can't. I've got an idea that

27:15.539 --> 27:20.499
you've got a group of people that are isolated. 
They're isolated from politics. They're very

27:22.707 --> 27:24.414
poor, very poor people. The only thing they had... 
The president. The president. Yes, the president

27:31.157 --> 27:34.161
of the nation. Francisco Madero. Francisco 
Madero. His people. No, in Mexico. In Mexico. The

27:41.751 --> 27:45.076
president of Mexico and the city of Mexico. Yes, 
but the people of your people, do they like Madero?

27:48.547 --> 27:51.293
No, they didn't take decisions. No, they didn't 
have political things. They didn't have meetings

27:56.345 --> 28:00.936
or elections. No, there are no elections? No. Was 
he a mayor of Camargo? Well, not in Camargo, he was

28:10.494 --> 28:15.764
from Mexico. When you lived there? In Camargo, 
yes. How did he become mayor? I don't know. Didn't

28:22.216 --> 28:22.997
they vote? Yes, before the war. Before the war, 
they did vote. They all voted. Yes, before the war.

28:31.243 --> 28:31.924
Before the war. But when there was war, there was no 
peace, there was no tranquility, there was

28:31.984 --> 28:38.012
nothing. That's why we didn't go. Because there 
was no government. There was no government. And

28:47.784 --> 28:51.349
there were some people who took care of us. In the 
Camargo presidency, But my, this other, like I

28:52.503 --> 29:08.347
say, my grandfather, but he's not really my 
grandfather, that's the only person that I knew,

28:52.503 --> 29:08.347
because her father died when she was young, so I was 
at home. He used to say that... He used to say

29:10.731 --> 29:14.697
that... He had his, you know, you had your horse 
there and the soldiers would come and they would

29:15.368 --> 29:22.100
take him. So, he was the only one from his family. 
Yes. Pancho Villa? Ah, yes, yes. But is it after

29:32.429 --> 29:37.236
your family came here? No, we were here. We only had 
the newspapers. They ask me about the newspapers.

29:43.064 --> 29:44.085
60 years ago. How did they protect you here? Who 
protected you on this side of the river? You had

29:49.393 --> 29:51.556
American soldiers. So who protected you? No, by 
law. Which law? The Cote. If the soldiers could get

29:56.883 --> 29:59.807
to Camargo, why didn't they get here? They came 
here once, but with permission. on the 21st of

30:02.585 --> 30:12.903
March, because they were afraid, because they 
were afraid that they would be thrown on top of

30:02.585 --> 30:12.903
them. And then, how do you call the one in charge of 
the court? The judge? No, no, the one in charge of

30:20.637 --> 30:25.285
the court is Álvarez. What does he do? He's the head 
of the whole town. He was a warlord, and he ordered

30:31.124 --> 30:34.849
the families not to go out. And that they were 
allowed to go in because they were being thrown on

30:34.889 --> 30:43.040
us and they were killing us. And that's how they did 
it. They came in with a lot of peace, with things of

30:45.483 --> 30:52.472
gender, loaded and giving to the people. But we 
didn't go out.

30:56.197 --> 31:25.900
And another thing

30:56.197 --> 31:25.900
was

30:56.197 --> 31:25.900
that

31:27.297 --> 31:33.724
These people didn't have any weapons, I say. No, 
they didn't have any weapons. No, they didn't have

31:36.207 --> 31:40.071
any weapons, I say. No, they didn't have any 
weapons, I say. No, they didn't have any weapons, I

31:43.555 --> 31:46.838
say. No, they didn't have any weapons, I say. No, 
they didn't have any weapons, I say. And that's how

31:55.698 --> 32:03.586
all the noble, good people got together, because 
they were afraid. Yes. Fear, danger, danger. And

32:05.348 --> 32:08.591
the women, especially, or the men too? The men too. 
They were all afraid. My father had the bonfire on

32:11.815 --> 32:16.039
for the cattle, and he left it on. He let it go. He got 
angry. Because there were a lot of people without

32:18.742 --> 32:23.447
law. They didn't have law. Because all the old 
people were prisoners. There in Camargo they took

32:28.452 --> 32:37.441
a boy and we never saw him again.

32:38.422 --> 32:40.585
And they killed him there in Camargo. Those 
things. Are there people who live in Camargo now?

32:42.787 --> 32:43.868
Yes, a lot of people. It's peaceful, you have your 
law. Did those people return to Camargo? No. How

32:48.413 --> 32:50.915
did they get up again? Some people returned and 
others... They came from other places. Now they

32:55.870 --> 32:56.991
have a lot of people. Not yet. Now there is a lot of 
people and a lot of order and everything. Cases

33:03.438 --> 33:09.224
happen wherever they want, but the people are with 
their order, with their law. Yes. Well, in which

33:09.585 --> 33:16.972
country do you think life is better, here or in 
Mexico now? Well, here. Here? Why? Because here

33:20.416 --> 33:23.940
there is a lot of work. It's a difficult

33:24.865 --> 33:33.618
question. This, of course, is a richer country. We 
can't deny that.

33:43.993 --> 33:54.568
It's more advanced

33:43.993 --> 33:54.568
politically.

33:54.953 --> 33:56.475
Yes, women too. You'd rather live in Mexico. Why? 
Because I like the way of life. It's very nice out

34:02.202 --> 34:09.190
there in Monterrey, in Mexico, Guadalajara. It's 
more relaxed. No, it's very nice. My daughters are

34:11.793 --> 34:13.956
going to walk in the shadows. Because I have three 
daughters who are teachers. You? Married women.

34:17.981 --> 34:20.965
This is one of them. And I have another one who lives 
in Macaulay. Here I have two. How many children do

34:24.957 --> 34:28.481
you have? I had 11, thank you. 11? All of them were 
born. 11 children. And 3 are teachers. I have

34:39.535 --> 34:45.623
Marcos, Arturo, Ella, Marta.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.168
Marta is 4. 4 teachers. And the others, what kind of 
work? I'm a Carly Boomerang technician. I'm in the

34:59.019 --> 35:00.060
Air Force. The other brothers, what happened to 
them, one was killed in World War II at 22 years old.

35:07.531 --> 35:11.456
The other one was killed in an accident when he was 
27. He was the man. And my oldest brother. My oldest

35:14.941 --> 35:19.027
brother didn't go to college. He was also inducted 
in World War II. He lost his left arm. Y mis hijos

35:23.851 --> 35:26.034
vivimos bien cuando menos. No somos ricos, pero 
vivimos bien. I went for three years and I quit. You

35:33.824 --> 35:35.126
went to college for three years. Pues las otras 
también fueron al colegio, pero no alcanzaron.

35:38.670 --> 35:42.976
And the other one, my other sister did go for two or 
three years and she got married. Now, what is your

35:42.996 --> 35:43.777
name? Alfredo. Alfredo. And what are you? You're 
one of the younger. I'm the youngest. You're the

35:49.665 --> 35:50.526
youngest. You're the baby of the family. Él es de la 
barrica. That one? Yes.

35:58.943 --> 36:01.325
Well, and your husband? What kind of work did he 
have? Well, he was a manual laborer. But he had

36:06.992 --> 36:08.013
land, right? We had cows and we had goats. Yes, and 
land of your own? Of my own. And the children, all my

36:12.778 --> 36:17.284
children went to school, well, all of them. The one 
who didn't take out his griffin was because he

36:17.324 --> 36:21.128
didn't want to. But we all live well, we never live 
badly. Thank God, I say, thank God. She just told

36:30.283 --> 36:33.166
you that she did it. Thank God. I am very... I 
believe a lot in God. I believe a lot in God. He has

36:41.114 --> 36:45.279
led me through mysterious paths that I did not 
think about. I have a master's son. I did not think

36:47.041 --> 36:48.603
about it. But one of them began to think. And we 
continued. I have one who is a teacher, who is in

36:53.145 --> 36:56.349
McAllen. They were putting her to study so that she 
could calm down for a while. To write, and there was

37:00.274 --> 37:02.397
a little girl. And she asked me for a pencil 
sharpener and I gave it to her. Because it was her,

37:06.582 --> 37:08.584
so that she was happy. And my father came, who 
raised me, my stepfather. And he said, and my

37:11.829 --> 37:15.133
daughter, what are you going to do? I, dad, no, no. 
Maita, teacher. I said, Maita. For what reason did

37:20.002 --> 37:36.002
your husband and I have this, how do you say, 
this...

37:38.851 --> 37:43.260
Because he didn't know how to read. And I don't know 
how to read. Yes. How old were you? How old were you

37:51.637 --> 37:55.284
when you went to school? Well, I think I didn't 
complete it. I should learn to read and write. In

38:00.980 --> 38:02.381
Camargo. Read and write, because in the Methodist 
Church we read and write. And I didn't like it when I

38:08.446 --> 38:15.132
entered the religion, I didn't like to do it unless 
I knew how to read. When did you learn to write? In

38:17.715 --> 38:19.116
school. At what age? 16 or 17 years old. Ah, not in 
Camargo. In Camargo, yes. Oh, 16 years. And it

38:26.607 --> 38:28.349
ended at 18? Yes, at 18. But I kept writing and 
reading books. I liked reading books. I liked

38:33.055 --> 38:33.716
reading. I liked reading. And I like it. Yes? Yes. 
And for this reason, these things were important

38:38.362 --> 38:43.809
to you all your life. And your husband also went to 
school? No, he didn't. He didn't? Precisely, this

38:49.916 --> 38:54.522
is what took us to school, the children, what he 
didn't know. He said, when we got married, we're

38:55.042 --> 39:01.751
not going to leave our children without knowing. 
We have to look for them. They go to school. They

39:04.334 --> 39:05.656
liked school. But because in those years, people 
were very decisive. Yes. They didn't like school.

39:14.628 --> 39:20.515
Well, my brothers didn't want, they didn't accept 
that my daughter went to school. Oh, yes. Yes, they

39:22.558 --> 39:24.120
did. This is difficult to understand. No. This is 
difficult to understand, and it still is in

39:30.978 --> 39:38.186
Mexico. In Mexico, higher learning is strictly 
cultural. You go to school, it's like a luxury.

39:46.836 --> 39:47.717
Culture is a luxury. In this country, as far as I'm 
concerned, you can make a living without having to

39:48.538 --> 39:54.985
go to school, as long as you know the basics. The 
hard earning is just for culture. In this country,

39:58.523 --> 40:00.405
of course, it's the worst. You have to have this 
education to get a job. But my husband told his

40:03.008 --> 40:10.936
children that he had lost a lot of good jobs because 
he didn't know how to read or write or count. And

40:10.956 --> 40:16.561
that led him to have an idea to educate his 
children. But we didn't think we were going to have

40:17.422 --> 40:22.407
teachers. No, I didn't think about it in those 
years. Education wasn't worth anything. No? No.

40:30.326 --> 40:33.149
There was no education, so it wasn't worth 
anything. I was in a ranch and I took out a bus full of

40:34.972 --> 40:41.620
votes so that I could take my children to school and 
others. The whole ranch fell into the school. But I

40:43.162 --> 40:44.384
looked for votes. Yes? Yes. So that they would give 
me the bus to take them abroad. That's what I did.

40:52.153 --> 40:53.355
The interest. I knew that

40:54.297 --> 41:00.506
my children knew about it. He was very loving, and 
he was just like me. We thought the same, I think. He

41:07.858 --> 41:12.024
was my son, he was old and his father died when he got 
married. He was never talking, fighting, saying

41:12.745 --> 41:15.770
bad words. He was the one who said it. We talked at 
the table and everything we were going to do, very

41:19.575 --> 41:23.241
peaceful. They were all

41:23.778 --> 41:48.334
Catholics.

41:48.533 --> 41:58.743
In Mexico, everybody's

41:48.533 --> 41:58.743
a Catholic.

41:59.463 --> 42:14.698
She

41:59.463 --> 42:14.698
thought

41:59.463 --> 42:14.698
she had changed.

42:15.179 --> 42:17.781
Oh.

42:18.419 --> 42:24.092
And he had children and even met a grandson. And his 
wife and I were there when Kirby died, one of the

42:24.113 --> 42:30.047
veterans. And we came home at midnight, we took 
care of everything, very happy. Only with God and

42:36.357 --> 42:38.679
Christ. When they were there, they also had 
another turning point. When we had World War II,

42:42.844 --> 42:51.673
when World War II began, the boys were old enough to 
go to war. They were all different. They almost

42:53.895 --> 42:56.538
went back to Mexico. But the boys didn't go. Did you 
prefer to go back to Mexico? I did want to go because

43:02.264 --> 43:04.947
I didn't want them to go to war. Because of the war. 
Because of the war. Yeah. Well, a mother. My

43:12.943 --> 43:19.075
children were just starting to live and I was going 
to take them with me, as they told me. They all went

43:19.135 --> 43:20.036
to war. Yes, all of your children? Yes, five of 
them. My mother is my third daughter. The sense of

43:28.535 --> 43:38.465
loyalty and being born here, and it has been an 
important factor in staying here, that is on the

43:28.535 --> 43:38.465
part of the children. But you say you would... I 
would pray that I would go to Mexico. Why don't you?

43:47.715 --> 43:48.395
I couldn't get a job. If I didn't get a job, a good 
job, a good job, I'd go back. Where would you go in

43:53.240 --> 43:54.562
Mexico? Anywhere. But I prefer southern Mexico 
than southern Mexico. You get a little altitude

43:58.437 --> 44:01.961
and the weather gets a little better. Much nicer. 
Where have you been in Mexico? Mexico City and

44:07.066 --> 44:16.155
around

44:07.066 --> 44:16.155
Mexico City. Bueno, en los días de la Revolución, 
¿hay

44:16.175 --> 44:27.887
problemas aquí en la frontera? Antre los tropas. 
Después de su familia fueron por aquí. ¿Hay

problemas con tropas? ¿Cuáles tropas? ¿De

45:38.000 --> 45:46.491
that she has allowed to drink.
