00:02.528 --> 00:12.378
31 testing 1 2 3 4 testing Just say something well You say you're testing.

00:12.418 --> 00:13.439
Well, what are you testing?

00:14.941 --> 00:28.755
Sorry Down at the Houston City Club have the joy and honor of interviewing mr. Earl Patterson class of 25 mr. Patterson to begin with I

00:29.343 --> 00:36.452
would you describe where you grew up, where you went to high school, what your family did, where they'd come from?

00:37.874 --> 00:42.139
Well, actually, I was born in Dallas in 1903.

00:42.179 --> 00:48.447
And I lost my father when I was three years old.

00:48.527 --> 00:52.432
My mother remarried when I was nine.

00:53.654 --> 00:54.495
That was 1912.

00:54.635 --> 00:56.397
We moved to Galveston.

00:56.950 --> 01:06.679
where I went through high school, well, grade school and high school there and graduated from Ball High School in February 21.

01:06.879 --> 01:14.006
I had to go a half a term longer because I failed Spanish, believe it or not, and had to take another three months.

01:15.488 --> 01:17.770
And I graduated from Ball High School.

01:17.810 --> 01:25.337
As well as I recall now, I got a job that summer working on the Todd Shipyard in Galveston

01:25.958 --> 01:33.565
They were remodeling some of the ships at that time and taking iron pipe off the deck and replacing it with copper pipe.

01:34.206 --> 01:38.870
And it was a dirty, lousy job, but it was a job anyhow.

01:39.531 --> 01:41.913
And then that fall, I, of course, went to A&M.

01:42.954 --> 01:43.354
All right.

01:44.135 --> 01:46.537
How did you come to be interested in A&M?

01:46.577 --> 01:47.538
What did you know about A&M?

01:47.558 --> 01:55.105
I knew the two universities, University of Texas and A&M.

01:56.620 --> 02:05.134
I guess maybe one thing, A&M was closer to home, closer to Galveston, and I liked that.

02:05.295 --> 02:19.439
Also, I had a friend who was—had a brother who was in my high school class, and I got to talking to this man who was in A&M at the time, and he asked me what I was going to take, what course, and I didn't have the slightest idea.

02:19.459 --> 02:22.003
Like most of them, I didn't know what I wanted to do.

02:22.523 --> 02:28.147
He suggested you take mechanical engineering because that was one of the broadest engineering courses.

02:28.167 --> 02:29.513
They had a little bit of everything.

02:30.303 --> 02:36.048
And looking back now, I think that was probably a wise judgment that I made or situation that I made.

02:36.088 --> 02:44.115
And then that fall, I entered A&M with a class of 1925.

02:44.135 --> 02:44.496
Right.

02:45.657 --> 02:48.780
Had you gone up to visit before you went up to enroll?

02:49.080 --> 02:49.480
No, sir.

02:49.841 --> 02:57.808
The closest I saw was A&M College as it would pass by on the Southern Pacific Railroad.

02:58.048 --> 02:59.830
So you applied by mail?

02:59.850 --> 03:00.310
Yes.

03:00.290 --> 03:04.180
Do you remember what it cost that first year?

03:05.704 --> 03:10.857
As well as I recall, it was somewhere around the neighborhood of $125 per semester.

03:11.461 --> 03:16.287
And your family, what were they doing then for a living?

03:16.307 --> 03:21.774
My mother remarried, as I mentioned, and he was in the tugboat business in Galveston.

03:22.815 --> 03:25.038
I think it was called the Bay Towing Company.

03:25.959 --> 03:29.304
And he was general manager of the Bay Towing Company.

03:29.384 --> 03:34.330
And then after that, he eventually became vice president and general manager.

03:34.850 --> 03:40.976
When you went to A&M that first time, did you go by yourself or did somebody go?

03:40.996 --> 03:41.557
Yes, yes.

03:41.657 --> 03:42.698
I went by myself.

03:43.399 --> 03:43.959
On the train?

03:44.279 --> 03:46.942
On the train as a scared freshman.

03:46.962 --> 03:49.084
And what did you take with you?

03:49.104 --> 03:49.745
Do you remember?

03:50.706 --> 03:58.374
I had a, at that time, a thing called a steamer trunk, which was like a little wardrobe.

03:58.414 --> 04:01.897
That and a handbag, I suppose.

04:01.937 --> 04:02.798
That was about it.

04:03.149 --> 04:05.593
What what was in that steamer trunk reckon?

04:06.394 --> 04:13.004
A suit of clothes, some shirts, socks and handkerchiefs, underwear, maybe another pair of shoes.

04:13.044 --> 04:13.745
That was about it.

04:13.785 --> 04:15.167
Not very much.

04:15.187 --> 04:21.556
And how did you get from the station over to the dormitory or wherever you were supposed to be?

04:22.878 --> 04:23.600
Shank's mare.

04:24.541 --> 04:25.082
I walked.

04:25.943 --> 04:27.565
And you carried that that steamer?

04:28.106 --> 04:30.370
No, I don't remember how that got there.

04:30.450 --> 04:32.633
Actually, I kind of think that

04:33.389 --> 04:40.880
At the railroad station there were some of those wagons that you had to pull and we probably with some other students with us.

04:40.901 --> 04:45.007
We loaded up a bunch of those and then hauled them all down there to the dormitory.

04:45.307 --> 04:48.452
At that time I think it was in Foster Hall I spent the first night.

04:49.073 --> 04:51.116
Were there some other Galveston boys with you?

04:52.558 --> 04:56.865
There were some that entered that year but I can't remember

04:57.132 --> 05:02.442
particularly doing that, moving the baggage to the dormitory.

05:02.782 --> 05:04.806
As far as you know, you got off the train by yourself?

05:04.886 --> 05:05.167
Yes.

05:05.668 --> 05:06.068
Okay.

05:06.389 --> 05:10.977
Now, one or two of the other fellows may have been there, and we may have sat together.

05:10.997 --> 05:12.380
I don't remember the details of that.

05:12.660 --> 05:16.647
How did you get broken into the Corps?

05:18.511 --> 05:20.254
Well, the funny thing...

05:20.977 --> 05:32.389
I had, my mother bought me a saxophone during the summer, well I guess in the spring of 1921, and incidentally I started with a class of 25, but I didn't graduate until 26.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.793
Calculus got me.

05:34.916 --> 05:36.420
So anyhow.

05:38.223 --> 05:39.205
What was I talking about?

05:39.525 --> 05:42.910
About how you got into the dorm and into the core.

05:43.812 --> 05:48.579
I had taken saxophone lessons for about three months.

05:49.801 --> 05:58.135
And this friend of mine, who was also going to go to A&M, the brother, knew that I had taken up the saxophone.

05:58.155 --> 06:00.198
He said, well, you're going to get in the band at A&M.

06:00.298 --> 06:02.762
I doubt it because I don't know how to read music yet.

06:03.265 --> 06:04.707
And he said, well, that don't make any difference.

06:04.727 --> 06:13.941
When you get there, go see Farley, who was a band director, Farley or Farley, and tell him you want to get in the band and you'll take lessons from him if he'll let you in the band.

06:15.223 --> 06:26.540
So, a day or two after I got there, I went over and looked up Farley and told him that I was there, I had a saxophone, I'd like to get in the band if I could.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.745
And he said, well, come on over and move your stuff over.

06:30.333 --> 06:33.717
And I said, if I can get in the band, I'll take lessons from you.

06:34.878 --> 06:44.348
So I moved over and I got into the band and waited for Mr. Farley to ask me, when are you going to start taking lessons?

06:44.968 --> 06:49.533
Well, to this day, he hasn't asked me until this day I haven't taken any lessons from him.

06:50.174 --> 06:54.258
But I played in the band, and for the first year or two, I played by ear.

06:55.259 --> 06:58.502
Now, how did you get into the band?

06:58.522 --> 06:59.023
Did you...

06:59.459 --> 07:00.741
Did he allow you then?

07:00.801 --> 07:01.502
Oh, yes.

07:01.642 --> 07:06.350
Yes, I moved right into the dormitory with the other freshmen that were in there.

07:07.231 --> 07:13.340
There happened to be another tenor saxophone player there, Arthur Elliott, who is still alive and living down in Corpus Christi.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.046
He could really eat up music.

07:17.106 --> 07:19.710
He could read the spots very well.

07:20.732 --> 07:26.040
And I would listen to him playing, and then I would look at the music,

07:26.527 --> 07:27.828
and kind of follow there.

07:27.868 --> 07:32.853
And after doing that for several months, I kind of got onto the idea of what was in there.

07:33.734 --> 07:35.716
And that's about the story.

07:35.776 --> 07:42.442
I stayed in the band the whole time I was there and enjoyed it very much and gained a lot of experience in it.

07:42.802 --> 07:45.685
About how many freshmen were in the band your first year?

07:46.946 --> 07:51.130
Well, the total band was right around 100 at that time.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.872
That was in the fall of 25.

07:53.813 --> 08:00.983
And I don't remember for sure, but I'd guess 15 maybe, freshman, 10 to 15.

08:05.330 --> 08:10.898
Was there any kind of testing or any admission process?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.520
Not at that time, no.

08:13.121 --> 08:21.593
And recently the band director was down here at A&M one day, and I asked him then, what do they do now to...

08:22.012 --> 08:23.294
get people get into the band.

08:23.314 --> 08:25.597
They said, well, we check them very thoroughly now.

08:25.637 --> 08:29.042
We have to because there's just so many wants to get in the band.

08:29.723 --> 08:34.750
But at that time, somebody said, if you knew which end to blow in, why Farley would let you in the band.

08:35.672 --> 08:36.733
And that's about the way it was.

08:37.334 --> 08:40.318
Describe, what did y'all call him?

08:40.339 --> 08:42.562
Colonel Farley or Mr. Farley?

08:43.002 --> 08:43.463
No.

08:43.966 --> 08:44.987
I guess it was Mister.

08:45.327 --> 08:50.793
I don't recall that he had any title or anything, except just the band director.

08:51.313 --> 08:54.096
And what was he, big, small?

08:54.116 --> 08:58.980
No, he was rather small, rather frail, had a little black mustache, and I'm not sure.

08:59.761 --> 09:01.162
I always thought he was Italian.

09:02.404 --> 09:11.172
And he was there about two years, I guess, when Dunn, oh, Dunn came in.

09:11.354 --> 09:12.796
Talk about Colonel Dunn.

09:12.896 --> 09:13.897
Colonel Dunn, yes.

09:13.917 --> 09:17.140
Now, I think at that time, I don't think he had the title of Colonel.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.302
I think it was Major Dunn when he first came in.

09:20.284 --> 09:31.556
And he was there until Vern, the director after him.

09:32.076 --> 09:34.499
I can't remember, but he was there a long time.

09:34.619 --> 09:40.365
He was a freshman, and I was surprised years later on to find out here he was, the band director.

09:41.257 --> 09:43.080
Vern Adams.

09:43.241 --> 09:44.904
Vern Adams, yes, yes.

09:44.924 --> 09:49.793
All right, so what outfit were you in in the Corps?

09:50.494 --> 09:55.123
I was in the infantry attached to Company B my first year there.

09:55.163 --> 10:00.873
I think the remaining years I was assigned to Company D in the infantry still.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.480
Did you all have nicknames for units then?

10:05.202 --> 10:06.743
Not that I recall, no.

10:07.304 --> 10:08.845
And you lived in Foster Hall?

10:09.866 --> 10:10.547
No, no.

10:12.088 --> 10:15.151
The band lived in Milner.

10:15.411 --> 10:15.791
Milner.

10:15.811 --> 10:16.512
Milner Hall.

10:16.792 --> 10:19.615
Describe your room your freshman year.

10:19.695 --> 10:20.416
What was in it?

10:21.737 --> 10:26.020
Well, there were three of us in the room and our beds were stacked one on top of each other.

10:27.422 --> 10:28.503
Was it three or two?

10:28.523 --> 10:33.387
I believe there were just two of us in there that first year.

10:33.923 --> 10:59.391
and it had just a regular bunk bed stacked on one one on top of the other and I had I think I guess there were two tables in there one for each one of us and I of course had that little steamer trunk I don't recall whether the other fella had a dresser of any kind or not there wasn't very much in there except just what you brought with you and you had a closet

11:00.147 --> 11:01.709
I don't think there was a closet.

11:03.070 --> 11:05.794
I can't remember the details now, where they hung their clothes.

11:05.814 --> 11:09.017
Of course, I put all mine up in a little steamer truck.

11:09.037 --> 11:15.405
And you didn't have a ceiling fan or anything like that?

11:15.565 --> 11:16.266
No, no.

11:16.286 --> 11:17.207
Just open windows.

11:17.347 --> 11:18.028
Open windows.

11:19.490 --> 11:20.891
Did anyone have a radio?

11:22.413 --> 11:22.714
No.

11:23.094 --> 11:27.319
That was before radios, as well as I recall.

11:27.586 --> 11:39.865
A few years later, I lived out in the shacks, and at that time, radio was coming in, and somebody two or three rows over did have a radio, and we used to go over at nighttime and listen to it.

11:40.346 --> 11:43.671
Describe the uniforms that y'all wore every day.

11:44.444 --> 11:49.909
It was just a regular Army issue uniform.

11:50.910 --> 11:51.330
Khaki.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.855
We wore, we didn't have, I guess we did have a blouse.

12:00.599 --> 12:04.903
And I don't remember now whether we had to buy it that first year or whether it was issued to us.

12:05.403 --> 12:06.704
Did you have olive drab?

12:06.985 --> 12:09.066
Olive drab and rack leggings.

12:10.588 --> 12:13.050
Some of them as well as I recall had

12:13.385 --> 12:17.154
canvas leggings, the underclassmen.

12:17.174 --> 12:18.537
The seniors, of course, wore boots.

12:20.201 --> 12:22.186
Did the seniors yet wear flared?

12:23.649 --> 12:24.812
I don't believe that that

12:25.315 --> 12:30.601
particular time they did, but within a year or two, they had the flared pants along with the boots.

12:31.101 --> 12:34.886
For you as a fish, what kind of hat did you wear or cap?

12:35.006 --> 12:43.876
We had a cap, and I don't remember now whether we wore a hat or not.

12:43.896 --> 12:53.006
I think we must have had a hat in addition to the cap, the raker cap that we wore with a bill on it.

12:53.426 --> 12:54.968
Were you all called fish yet?

12:55.724 --> 12:56.446
Called Fish?

12:56.826 --> 12:57.127
Yes.

12:57.949 --> 12:59.251
Hey, Fish Patterson.

13:00.554 --> 13:02.358
And was your roommate your old lady?

13:02.558 --> 13:03.500
Did y'all use that term?

13:03.520 --> 13:04.162
Old lady, yes.

13:04.983 --> 13:10.074
I had two roommates, neither of which came back for their sophomore year.

13:10.094 --> 13:12.058
They both dropped out after their freshman year.

13:12.740 --> 13:14.323
I don't know whatever happened to them.

13:14.827 --> 13:18.593
Describe a typical class day.

13:18.613 --> 13:21.176
In other words, a Monday through Friday.

13:21.717 --> 13:25.863
Describe when the day began and what you all did as the day went along.

13:26.644 --> 13:30.069
Well, the first thing was bugle call.

13:31.852 --> 13:32.513
First call.

13:32.914 --> 13:33.554
You'd hear that.

13:33.635 --> 13:39.383
We'd get up and dress and go out into formation.

13:40.375 --> 13:46.426
I don't remember if the band marched the Cadet Corps into the mess hall for breakfast or not.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.272
Maybe we did, maybe we didn't.

13:50.533 --> 14:02.113
But anyhow, we were the first ones to enter the mess hall, because we were in Milner Hall, and we were the first one to get in the line there, and then the rest of the Cadet Corps formed on military walk.

14:03.089 --> 14:05.452
And we marched into the band.

14:05.753 --> 14:12.443
We marched the band in, and the cadet corps all followed and went into the Spisa Hall for meals.

14:12.863 --> 14:17.210
Now, before you fell in with the band, did you have to clean up an upperclassman's room?

14:20.094 --> 14:24.921
We didn't have time as well as I recall, but we had to after we came back, I assure you.

14:25.221 --> 14:25.682
Oh, okay.

14:26.423 --> 14:27.645
And what would that involve?

14:27.980 --> 14:35.590
making up their bed and maybe washing out the wash basin to clean it up a little bit and possibly sweeping out the room.

14:35.851 --> 14:37.212
Did you have to polish their shoes?

14:38.294 --> 14:39.536
I don't recall that we did.

14:39.616 --> 14:42.259
We may have, but I don't remember ever doing it.

14:43.201 --> 14:50.230
And in the dining hall, describe the routine of how your outfit sat and what you freshmen had to do.

14:50.470 --> 14:55.037
Well, we all marched in and then we were assigned certain tables.

14:56.078 --> 14:56.839
I think there were

14:57.798 --> 15:00.382
either three or four on each side of the table.

15:04.068 --> 15:14.886
The food was, well, part of the food was already on the table, but scrambled eggs and things like that was brought in later by the boys who worked there in the mess hall.

15:16.108 --> 15:23.400
And during the meal, the officer of the day would read out the announcements for the day and

15:24.123 --> 15:34.418
as he would mention one item and then the freshmen all took their knives and banged the table when he finished that one.

15:34.438 --> 15:38.965
Then he had nailed something else and we'd bang the table again after he was through.

15:39.125 --> 15:42.970
And that went on until the Office of the Day read all of the notes for the day.

15:45.033 --> 15:51.042
Did you and your freshman buddies attempt any kind of pranks?

15:51.022 --> 15:52.283
in the dining hall?

15:52.824 --> 15:53.405
Any jokes?

15:54.706 --> 15:58.791
I don't recall that we did.

16:00.312 --> 16:03.276
We had certain names for certain foods.

16:03.956 --> 16:04.837
Share some of those.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.982
I'd rather not.

16:09.002 --> 16:18.092
One of them, I remember one of the customs was, as well as I recall now, freshmen could not have any, it was either pineapple pie or

16:18.815 --> 16:21.319
or apricot pie was one or the other.

16:21.359 --> 16:22.942
That was taboo for the freshmen.

16:23.423 --> 16:26.027
I don't remember who got it now, probably the sophomores.

16:26.949 --> 16:29.433
But mashed potatoes were spuds.

16:31.597 --> 16:32.538
Milk was cow.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.820
Milk was cow.

16:34.141 --> 16:35.283
Meat was bull neck.

16:36.966 --> 16:37.807
Tea was horse?

16:38.989 --> 16:39.430
Iced tea?

16:40.191 --> 16:41.033
No.

16:41.053 --> 16:42.375
Oh.

16:43.975 --> 16:45.277
I'd rather not mention that.

16:45.297 --> 16:46.299
Ketchup was blood.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.242
Yeah, ketchup was blood.

16:48.683 --> 16:49.624
Pepper was dirt.

16:51.007 --> 16:52.069
I don't remember that one.

16:53.691 --> 16:57.337
I don't remember all those names now, but it had a name for everything.

16:57.998 --> 16:59.942
Was the name for dessert Cush?

17:00.182 --> 17:00.883
Cush, yes.

17:01.484 --> 17:03.688
Were you freshmen allowed to eat

17:03.938 --> 17:07.204
Cush, except for the apricot and pineapple?

17:07.224 --> 17:07.465
Yes.

17:07.946 --> 17:23.095
And incidentally, we had a classmate whose name was, I can't think of it now, but his nickname was Cush.

17:23.311 --> 17:30.640
because of his given name and I can't think what that was now.

17:30.660 --> 17:34.045
Then did y'all ever throw any food?

17:35.827 --> 17:38.010
Later that would be they would throw things.

17:38.030 --> 17:50.466
I think that they did maybe throw a biscuit or something like that at somebody once in a while and getting back to this hitting the table with a knife when the officer of the day would get through and he'd

17:50.885 --> 17:55.191
give the command to rest, then we'd always bang the table with a knife again.

17:55.211 --> 18:00.138
Now, describe the quality of the food in general.

18:00.959 --> 18:05.987
Of course, everybody belly ached about it, but looking back on it, it was very good.

18:07.008 --> 18:11.755
Spezia did a good job, and we all gained weight on it, I'll assure you.

18:12.616 --> 18:15.581
Did you have some of the foods that you really liked?

18:15.621 --> 18:16.622
What were your favorites?

18:18.104 --> 18:25.127
I liked them all, frankly, and as far as I recall, I ate everything that they'd put on the table.

18:25.580 --> 18:29.144
Did you ever see Mr. Cebisa and so forth?

18:29.684 --> 18:35.330
I probably did, but I don't remember specifically being associated with them any.

18:36.051 --> 18:47.003
All right, so then after breakfast you'd go back to the dormitory, clean up the... Clean up the upperclassmen if you were assigned to it that day and get dressed.

18:47.924 --> 18:51.688
Well, I guess we were already dressed, but when it came time we'd head off to classes.

18:52.057 --> 18:55.681
Now, in what buildings were most of your classes held?

18:57.003 --> 19:04.472
The main building, which is, I guess they call it Old Main, that was where most of our general classes were held.

19:04.512 --> 19:08.557
Then there was a mechanical engineering building and the laboratory.

19:11.861 --> 19:17.828
Civil engineering was over in the civil engineering building, which was on further down military walk.

19:18.837 --> 19:22.721
The chemistry building was in the Old Main building.

19:25.323 --> 19:27.145
Did you have classes in science hall?

19:28.707 --> 19:29.087
No.

19:29.107 --> 19:29.507
Red Bridge?

19:29.528 --> 19:32.631
We didn't have a science hall at that time as well as I recall.

19:33.672 --> 19:37.876
That was the main, I guess most of our classes were held in the Old Main.

19:37.896 --> 19:42.821
Alright, what was there east of Old Main?

19:44.002 --> 19:45.283
Going

19:46.107 --> 19:51.877
Going away from the railroad track, what buildings were back there?

19:52.418 --> 19:59.971
Well, there was... I think there was a chemistry building back up over in there.

20:00.031 --> 20:04.819
Then there was one of the dormitories that I Company infantry lived in.

20:04.859 --> 20:06.462
They called it Black Eye Company.

20:08.285 --> 20:10.849
There was what we call a horse barn.

20:11.318 --> 20:13.001
which was kind of an auditorium.

20:13.022 --> 20:14.765
They had rodeos and things in there.

20:17.531 --> 20:20.477
There was a chemistry building over on that side.

20:20.537 --> 20:28.313
Extension building was back over there.

20:29.035 --> 20:30.137
And that was about it.

20:30.455 --> 20:32.439
There wasn't an awful lot familiar.

20:32.459 --> 20:35.605
There's quite a ways on over to what is now Highway 6.

20:35.886 --> 20:38.451
As a matter of fact, I don't remember Highway 6 being there.

20:38.471 --> 20:38.912
It wasn't.

20:39.092 --> 20:39.513
It wasn't.

20:40.495 --> 20:46.327
And the main road was what is now called Welburn Road, the main highway.

20:47.749 --> 20:50.555
The railroad station, was it a busy place?

20:51.056 --> 20:52.058
Are there people...

20:52.612 --> 20:53.653
coming and going?

20:55.996 --> 20:57.659
Not except train time.

20:58.159 --> 20:59.281
That's what I mean.

20:59.701 --> 21:01.344
Were there number stops?

21:03.146 --> 21:07.031
I guess there was a night train went through.

21:07.051 --> 21:15.783
I got in there around 9 or 10 o'clock going to Dallas, and then there was one in the afternoon around 3 o'clock in the afternoon came back going to Houston.

21:16.684 --> 21:18.747
Those two particularly now.

21:18.767 --> 21:20.028
That was Southern Pacific.

21:20.088 --> 21:21.370
There was also a

21:21.535 --> 21:37.961
The Katy Railroad went through there, and I don't recall passenger trains there, but I guess there were, but they came at times that none of us that I associated with went down there to the depot at that time of day.

21:38.301 --> 21:46.294
And I guess you all got accustomed to hearing the train whistle, or knowing... Yeah, I guess we did, but...

21:47.033 --> 21:50.788
About the only time any of us went down there was on Sunday afternoon.

21:50.808 --> 21:52.876
We would go down Sunday afternoon.

21:52.916 --> 21:57.634
The dairy barn was across the railroad track.

21:58.306 --> 22:03.874
We'd go down on Sunday to watch the train go through and wave to the girl on the train.

22:05.136 --> 22:14.891
And as I say, the dairy barn was on the other side of the railroad track, and we'd go over and get a pint of ice cream and come back over and wait for the train.

22:14.951 --> 22:21.841
And then after the train passed on, I went back to the dormitory rooms or down to the Y or the Casey's, someplace like that.

22:21.861 --> 22:24.986
All right, back to the day routine.

22:25.006 --> 22:26.929
And then you had classes all morning.

22:27.989 --> 22:28.510
Did you?

22:28.550 --> 22:28.970
Yes.

22:30.372 --> 22:36.680
Mostly, well, classrooms in the morning, and as well as I recall now, the lab work was usually in the afternoon.

22:37.321 --> 22:40.505
Did you fall in and march to noon chow?

22:40.846 --> 22:41.186
No.

22:41.206 --> 22:41.787
Oh, we did.

22:43.229 --> 22:50.338
We did, and the band played and marched them into chow, and then as well at night, they had retreat, and we marched in again.

22:50.398 --> 22:55.785
And where would the band gather for that?

22:57.740 --> 23:10.373
I don't remember the name of the street now that Milner Hall was on, but just across the street, what was... Military Walk.

23:10.894 --> 23:13.036
It was on the west side of Military Walk.

23:13.056 --> 23:18.902
There was a little park over there, and we would farm there, and then the cadet corps would march in.

23:18.922 --> 23:22.066
We were right there, the first thing out of Speza Hall.

23:22.786 --> 23:25.910
Now, in the afternoon, did y'all have intramurals?

23:26.750 --> 23:27.291
Yes.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.812
What were your favorite intramural?

23:29.932 --> 23:30.993
I didn't participate.

23:32.314 --> 23:40.341
Being in the band, what spare time we had, we went to band practice or practiced ourselves a little bit before band practice.

23:40.401 --> 23:42.062
Usually our band practice was at night.

23:43.724 --> 23:45.305
And would you practice every night?

23:47.067 --> 23:50.190
No, two or three times a week, though.

23:51.010 --> 23:56.535
Now, in the band, what were the songs that y'all played then most often?

23:57.460 --> 23:59.123
What was the Aggie repertoire?

23:59.244 --> 24:02.550
Well, the main one, of course, Goodbye to Texas.

24:02.570 --> 24:02.991
Okay.

24:03.091 --> 24:03.913
That and then.

24:03.993 --> 24:09.304
The Aggie wore him.

24:09.524 --> 24:10.506
Aggie wore him.

24:10.686 --> 24:11.368
And the spirit?

24:12.209 --> 24:14.133
No, the spirit was not born yet.

24:14.294 --> 24:14.694
Okay.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.498
It came along a little later on.

24:16.799 --> 24:18.080
a couple of years later on.

24:18.641 --> 24:27.891
And Mims, I think, was the name of the person that wrote it, and Adams arranged the music for it.

24:28.192 --> 24:32.877
Do you remember when y'all first began to play The Spirit?

24:32.897 --> 24:34.819
Was that during your time there?

24:35.620 --> 24:36.441
Yes, yes.

24:38.363 --> 24:39.424
What did y'all think of it?

24:39.444 --> 24:43.909
Probably very much.

24:44.550 --> 24:45.591
Well, now,

24:46.313 --> 24:48.216
I didn't particularly like it at first.

24:48.837 --> 24:58.350
I don't know, just something about it didn't quite sit right, but later on everybody got familiar with it and it turned out to be a very nice song.

24:58.370 --> 25:01.755
Was there any kind of a school song before the Spirit?

25:02.957 --> 25:04.038
An alma mater song?

25:04.939 --> 25:08.785
The only thing was, no, it was Goodbye to Texas, but that was about it.

25:09.886 --> 25:12.490
What other songs did y'all play regularly?

25:13.330 --> 25:14.751
Well, it was mostly marches.

25:15.032 --> 25:43.017
Of course, we played the Stars and Stripes Forever and National Emblem March, and there was one, the first one I ever tried to play was a WBM march, and it was a fairly simple march, and I would listen to Bugs Elliott playing, and I'd look at the spots, and like I say, it was a fairly easy march, and I picked up pretty much on how to read music that way.

25:43.756 --> 25:53.792
Alright, so then y'all practice then you would go back to the dorm change and then go over and Fall in to go to evening chow.

25:54.393 --> 26:00.263
Yes And we always had retreat and march the cadet corps in the child again

26:00.243 --> 26:06.778
And after supper, then what would you all do usually during weeknights?

26:08.842 --> 26:14.555
We might go to somebody's room or somebody come into our room for a little while.

26:14.615 --> 26:18.724
And I guess later on we had call to quarters.

26:19.227 --> 26:26.035
And then when you go went to your room and did your studying and you stayed there, supposedly.

26:30.641 --> 26:34.706
The, did you make some important friendships that first year?

26:36.929 --> 26:38.531
In terms of, they lasted?

26:40.173 --> 26:41.635
Not the first year, no.

26:42.996 --> 26:45.480
Like I say, my two roommates never did come back.

26:46.321 --> 26:47.462
But my,

26:53.146 --> 26:57.550
Yeah, I guess in my junior year I made some friendships that lasted until today.

26:58.231 --> 27:02.695
But for the sake of me, I cannot remember who I roomed with me in my sophomore year.

27:03.176 --> 27:04.197
What about the junior year?

27:04.217 --> 27:05.879
What made that special?

27:05.899 --> 27:13.887
Well, they built the shacks sometime during that year, and that fall we were put into the shacks.

27:14.107 --> 27:14.707
Where were they?

27:15.128 --> 27:22.495
They were between the YMCA and Speza Hall over on the west side of Military Walk.

27:23.183 --> 27:31.911
And as well as I recall, there were about one, two, three, four, about five or six rows of these shacks.

27:33.413 --> 27:37.297
And I happened to have one right on Military Walk.

27:37.377 --> 27:41.381
No, this was the street that the YMCA was on.

27:42.041 --> 27:46.946
Military Walk was back behind the Y. We were right on that other street.

27:46.986 --> 27:49.168
And that street is still there today.

27:49.188 --> 27:51.250
Of course, the shacks are all gone.

27:51.550 --> 28:00.730
But these were little wooden shacks, and there were three of us in this little wooden shack with the bunks, again, stacked one on top of the other.

28:00.870 --> 28:05.420
And unfortunately, I lived on the top bunk.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.584
Now, how did you get, why the top?

28:07.605 --> 28:08.366
How did you?

28:08.406 --> 28:09.930
I would climb up there some way.

28:09.990 --> 28:11.112
We didn't have any ladder.

28:11.412 --> 28:14.517
No, but why did you get stuck with the top one?

28:14.537 --> 28:15.077
I don't know.

28:16.279 --> 28:19.544
Unless they jumped in their bunks first, and that was all that was left.

28:20.085 --> 28:23.049
It wasn't assigned or anything like that, as well as I recall.

28:23.269 --> 28:29.438
These shacks were about what dimension?

28:29.458 --> 28:30.640
Oh... Were they one room each?

28:30.660 --> 28:32.082
They were one room, yes.

28:32.483 --> 28:34.686
And I'm guessing, you know,

28:36.083 --> 28:39.887
15 by 15, something like that.

28:39.907 --> 28:41.468
I ought to know I lived in them long enough.

28:41.488 --> 28:43.890
You had electricity, but did you have a wash basin?

28:45.452 --> 28:46.933
Was there any plumbing in it at all?

28:46.953 --> 28:51.498
We must have had a wash basin, but there was no other plumbing.

28:51.518 --> 28:57.103
We had to go to a shower bath that was built over there next row or two.

28:57.864 --> 28:59.325
And about how many shacks were there?

29:02.048 --> 29:03.289
I guess it was...

29:05.345 --> 29:15.416
They were about ten deep, maybe not, well between eight and ten deep on each side, and they, there was a little street in between the two.

29:15.836 --> 29:20.881
They faced each other, and the next two would face each other, the next two would face each other.

29:21.482 --> 29:24.245
And these were built because the enrollment was growing?

29:24.525 --> 29:27.448
Yes, and there was no dormitory, no dormitory.

29:27.528 --> 29:28.990
I could hear these things whistling.

29:29.695 --> 29:35.642
How is it that you and your buddies, how did y'all get the shacks instead of somebody else?

29:35.822 --> 29:36.783
I have no idea.

29:36.823 --> 29:38.445
They just assigned the band to it.

29:38.565 --> 29:39.426
Oh, the band.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.628
The whole band was there.

29:41.068 --> 29:46.294
And there was some others there besides the band, too.

29:46.354 --> 29:50.839
And I don't remember what company it was, whether it was artillery, cavalry, or what.

29:50.879 --> 29:54.964
But the band just occupied part of the shacks.

29:54.984 --> 29:57.627
And were they hot or cold?

29:57.978 --> 30:01.502
We had a wood-burning fireplace or wood-burning stove.

30:01.642 --> 30:02.223
In each one?

30:02.383 --> 30:03.685
In each one, yeah.

30:03.705 --> 30:04.706
And where'd you get the wood?

30:04.766 --> 30:06.768
Did the campus provide it?

30:06.788 --> 30:08.350
The campus provided that.

30:08.370 --> 30:09.451
I don't remember.

30:10.132 --> 30:20.564
We undoubtedly had to go get it somewhere, and we probably made freshmen go get it for us, but it was a little wood-burning stove, and you'd have to get up in the morning to build your fire to warm up the place.

30:21.405 --> 30:23.007
Were there screens on the windows?

30:24.202 --> 30:26.425
I don't remember, but there surely were.

30:26.505 --> 30:27.186
There must have been.

30:27.286 --> 30:28.708
So you weren't bothered by bugs?

30:28.768 --> 30:29.630
No, no.

30:31.012 --> 30:33.395
They were not too uncomfortable, actually.

30:33.455 --> 30:36.559
We fussed about them, but it was all right.

30:36.960 --> 30:41.166
So you were in those as a junior and a senior?

30:41.386 --> 30:41.486
Yes.

30:42.107 --> 30:42.948
In your fifth year?

30:45.011 --> 30:52.622
No, my fifth year, I lived in dear old Gathright Hall on the second floor front, where I looked out over everything.

30:53.446 --> 30:56.049
Now, Gathright was one of the oldest buildings on the campus.

30:56.069 --> 30:57.131
Yes, it was one of the oldest there.

30:57.171 --> 31:08.465
The post office was on the main floor of that building, and it seemed to me like there was something behind it.

31:11.188 --> 31:12.770
The bookstore was built later on.

31:12.830 --> 31:17.056
It was behind Gathright getting coerced.

31:17.076 --> 31:20.500
And was Gathright a pleasant place?

31:20.783 --> 31:24.060
I enjoyed there that year very much.
