00:03.878 --> 00:06.260
This is Ron Shorn interviewing Fred Franklin. 
Fred, would you say something for our mic? How

00:09.303 --> 00:18.732
about Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn, and 
Uranus?

00:18.832 --> 00:26.439
This is Ron Shorn on April 22, 1993, at the Center 
for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.501
And I'm interviewing Fred Franklin. Fred, what's 
your full name? Fred Aldrich Franklin. And when

00:33.865 --> 00:36.027
and where were you born? I was born in Worcester, 
Massachusetts on July 24, 1932. How

00:41.694 --> 00:47.360
did you first get interested in astronomy?

00:50.984 --> 00:51.865
Long pause. Long pause. Well, I had a grandfather 
who was interested in astronomy. I never knew him,

00:58.152 --> 01:00.534
but he left a lot of books behind. I had a chance to 
browse through those. We had a fairly active

01:03.802 --> 01:16.315
natural history society that urged people or 
children to come and visit, and I guess I went

01:03.802 --> 01:16.315
there, and it was quite an active astronomical 
group. There was a very good astronomy club there,

01:16.755 --> 01:22.761
and I had several friends who became keen on 
astronomy. This is at the age of 8, 9, and 10, and in

01:22.781 --> 01:29.108
fact, three of us made careers of it. We were 
together, too. Or Ed Olson. now at the University

01:32.742 --> 01:39.369
of Illinois, and Werner Neuper, who was at 
Goddard, Greenville. So these things play on each

01:40.250 --> 01:42.352
other. Ed was a tiny bit older and very good with 
making telescopes. So we had quite a number of

01:45.356 --> 01:49.700
possibilities of developing interest. And so it 
began in that way. And I must say, the local

01:53.445 --> 01:56.428
astronomy club was very nice. The older people in 
that were very helpful toward the the younger

02:01.632 --> 02:11.366
generation, and they incorporated us into their 
programs and went observing, looking at eclipses

02:01.632 --> 02:11.366
and having talks and so on, visiting other 
observatories. So that was a nice introduction.

02:14.890 --> 02:16.312
Where did you go to undergraduate school? I was 
very keen to come to Harvard, and so I did. What year

02:21.600 --> 02:23.002
did you graduate? 1954. And what was your major? 
Astronomy. Astronomy major. And your minor? I

02:29.425 --> 02:32.509
don't know that we had any minors. I guess I was a 
minor, but I'm not sure I had one beyond that. So

02:37.496 --> 02:39.819
when you entered, you knew you wanted to be an 
astronomer. Ron, it's funny. I decided that with

02:41.061 --> 02:51.696
rare wisdom, I guess, that I was not going to follow 
the practical dictates of my family, but at least

02:41.061 --> 02:51.696
for a while I was going to do what I felt was fun to do 
and wanted to do. I didn't really think of making

02:51.716 --> 02:58.605
astronomy a career, but I didn't think also that it 
was appropriate to come to college and plan

02:59.142 --> 03:09.837
exactly what you wanted to do, let's say in a 
commercial or business-like sense, I decided

02:59.142 --> 03:09.837
just to study what was interesting and fun. And 
always expecting it probably would stop the next

03:11.099 --> 03:14.884
day or the next year. There'd be a knock on the door 
and I'd be sent out to the salt mines or something,

03:14.904 --> 03:23.877
but I really wanted to study the things that I 
liked. And it was a more a case of good fortune in

03:28.201 --> 03:33.187
terms of timing that allowed me to make a career of 
things. What was the good fortune in timing? I

03:35.970 --> 03:39.774
think as I was in graduate school and getting out of 
graduate school. And that was for Harvard? That

03:40.915 --> 03:41.936
was Harvard, too. That was as the Sputniks were in 
orbit, and suddenly astronomy was a very active

03:42.437 --> 03:50.286
field with much more money infused into it. NASA 
was founded, and suddenly many small or

03:50.746 --> 03:57.634
medium-sized colleges and universities were 
starting departments. So that there was, as

03:58.171 --> 04:07.426
opposed to present time, there was an opening 
market for people who would teach or do research in

03:58.171 --> 04:07.426
astronomy. It was a very fortunate and rare, I 
think, business. When did you get your PhD? In

04:11.893 --> 04:12.734
1962. And what was your thesis topic? I worked on 
Saturn's rings under the aegis of Fred Whipple as a

04:16.099 --> 04:23.571
formal advisor.

04:24.074 --> 04:24.895
What about the rings? Stability or their 
composition or physical structure? Several

04:28.340 --> 04:29.421
areas, really. There's been a lot of rather low 
quality photometry of the rings, measuring the

04:31.124 --> 04:36.672
opposition effect in various colors. So I set 
about doing that to try to get really good

04:37.172 --> 04:44.042
photometry and to separate the brightness 
contributions of rings A and B. So part of it was,

04:45.924 --> 04:51.432
first, the obtaining the photometry over a six 
month period. and then analyzing that. And then

04:53.703 --> 05:08.376
once that had been done, looking into the 
stability questions, too, whether the rings were

04:53.703 --> 05:08.376
a stable phenomenon, a stable system or not, to 
redo some of the Maxwell work, the classic Adams

04:53.703 --> 05:08.376
Prize essays of the last century. So it was a 
two-pronged effort, really, but basically

05:09.717 --> 05:19.866
designed to try to get a fairly good comprehensive 
picture at that time of the dynamics and structure

05:09.717 --> 05:19.866
of Saturn's rings. When did you decide to go into 
things planetary rather than galaxies or

05:20.369 --> 05:27.140
cosmology or stars? It's a very, very good 
question, and you'll get a, because it's a good

05:27.421 --> 05:35.895
question, a rather poor or fragmentary answer, 
but I'll do the best I can. And perhaps there's no

05:35.955 --> 05:45.972
overwhelming, compelling reason, but a little 
bits of motivations here and there. I think when I

05:47.133 --> 05:52.080
was a graduate student at Harvard, it was sort of a 
transition time, in a way. It was the Shapley era

05:52.100 --> 05:57.969
had ended, and Donald Menzel was the director. It 
was perhaps not because it was a transition and a

05:59.351 --> 06:03.917
number of things were happening. It was not 
perhaps the very finest hour of the observatory.

06:09.505 --> 06:16.836
Bach, who was, of course, very keen on attracting 
students, left when I was a graduate student. And

06:17.238 --> 06:20.042
in general, it was an unsettled era.

06:23.687 --> 06:45.135
It seemed maybe a semi, well, let's say 
unconsciously to me that the person whom I was

06:23.687 --> 06:45.135
attracted to for his science and for his interest 
and his thoughtfulness was Fred Whipple.

06:45.571 --> 06:50.276
Dr. Menzel was developing his solar project, was 
traveling a lot. There was nothing very

06:50.917 --> 06:52.739
attractive to me there. Bach was very keen on 
attracting students, but he was a very emotional

06:52.759 --> 06:58.926
man. And somehow, it didn't somehow quite gel with 
me. I liked him very much. I admired him very much.

07:06.113 --> 07:09.117
But there was something that kept me away from 
galactic astronomy. Perhaps because he was

07:09.217 --> 07:14.042
thinking of leaving, also He was keenest, of 
course, at that time on radio astronomy, and I felt

07:14.731 --> 07:20.918
electronically very ungifted. I was fascinated 
by theoretical work. Max Crook was here, who was a

07:26.264 --> 07:31.130
marvelous person, but hard to work with because he 
was hard to find. Somehow, it was a case of being

07:31.170 --> 07:41.582
interested in theory and the feeling that Fred 
Whipple was wise and good, helpful man. And

07:46.516 --> 07:54.908
another reason was that one of the people who came 
to work with him, Alan Cook, was at that time

07:46.516 --> 07:54.908
unmarried and often here, and we talked a lot. And 
Alan is a very bright fellow. He's an interesting

07:57.332 --> 08:11.552
person in many ways, but he was certainly always 
available to talk to, and so a number of the work, a

07:57.332 --> 08:11.552
certain amount of the work we did was, I did on the 
range, was done in collaboration with him. So it

08:12.477 --> 08:17.905
was a case of having good people to talk to and a 
certain amount of stability, I think. There was no

08:17.925 --> 08:23.915
conscious decision on my part to study planetary 
astronomy. After you got your PhD, where did you

08:24.796 --> 08:26.919
go? It was interesting. I

08:29.083 --> 08:41.522
rather wanted to stay here, but there was a good 
feeling that it was wise for students not to spend

08:29.083 --> 08:41.522
too much time in one place. And I was offered a 
teaching position at the University of

08:42.093 --> 08:45.417
Massachusetts. At that time, and still to this 
day, University of Massachusetts and some of the

08:45.997 --> 08:59.772
surrounding institutions like Smith and Amherst 
and Hampshire and Mount Holyoke have formed now a

08:45.997 --> 08:59.772
five-college department. At that time, it was a 
smaller number of people, but I was invited to come

09:00.853 --> 09:10.564
and teach at the University of Massachusetts and 
join that, I guess it was at that time,

09:00.853 --> 09:10.564
four-college department. I knew several of the 
people there. It seemed like a rather nice thing to

09:14.192 --> 09:16.054
do. And as I remember, I was finishing the thesis 
with about three minutes to spare. And so I didn't

09:24.244 --> 09:29.591
want to take the time to find applications for 
positions. And this one, in some sense, came

09:29.671 --> 09:33.195
looking for me. So I was delighted to accept it. An 
old friend of mine, Ed Olson, whom I mentioned

09:35.401 --> 09:41.908
earlier, was there at the time, and that was a very 
nice lead-in. So I went out there and had a very

09:42.849 --> 09:46.833
pleasant year. I have to say that maybe two-thirds 
of the way through it, Fred Whipple called and

09:46.853 --> 09:57.585
asked if I wanted to return on the Smithsonian 
staff. And I was only too happy to accept, because a

09:57.605 --> 10:05.053
year there was fine, teaching I could do, and I 
guess adequately. But it wasn't something that I

10:07.690 --> 10:10.453
felt was my great calling. I was rather keen to come 
back to work. To spend a year or so doing something

10:12.535 --> 10:18.682
new, say recovering from graduate training, was 
fine. But I was very glad to come back. And so you

10:21.365 --> 10:23.147
came back here in what, 60? I came back here in the 
summer of 1963.

10:30.595 --> 10:35.040
What research did you do when you first came back 
here? keen on working more on the structure of

10:35.459 --> 10:43.448
Saturn's rings, on the gaseous envelope around 
the rings. I was also interested in doing more

10:44.669 --> 10:47.312
photometry. In fact, Fred Whipple had a project he 
wanted me to look into. And perhaps that was one

10:51.297 --> 10:53.659
reason why he lured me back. There had been some 
work on the Smithsonian side on rather

10:53.679 --> 11:00.227
approximate photometry on the Earthshine. And he 
wanted someone to work on that and see if he could

11:03.573 --> 11:10.981
make a little more sense of the Earth's albedo as 
determined by measuring the Earth's shine. And so

11:11.041 --> 11:12.343
I was able to do that. It was not a tremendously 
exciting project, but it was good fun to do that. I

11:19.831 --> 11:28.260
think I was keen on working principally on the 
Saturn system, on looking into the satellites,

11:19.831 --> 11:28.260
particularly the rings, the interrelation 
between the rings and the satellites. And I have to

11:28.961 --> 11:30.002
say that In my graduate training, I never took any 
courses in celestial mechanics. And I began to

11:34.872 --> 11:40.961
realize that if you're going to work in areas in the 
solar system, you should know at least a little

11:34.872 --> 11:40.961
bit. So I felt that I should pick up some knowledge 
in that area, too. What have you been doing since

11:47.850 --> 11:49.012
then? Give us a synopsis. Well, I have been keen on 
the rings for a long while. But I must say, again, my

11:56.847 --> 12:09.822
interests have turned a little bit away from that 
to problems related to dynamics, to

11:56.847 --> 12:09.822
some of the planetary satellites. Another

12:11.023 --> 12:25.960
friend and I colleague have worked for some time on 
the mutual phenomena, that is, the eclipses and

12:11.023 --> 12:25.960
occultations of the Galilean satellites, the 
long-term hope being that we can unravel the tidal

12:26.159 --> 12:29.844
evolution of Io's orbit. We're on the threshold, I 
think, of being able to do that, or at least set

12:30.445 --> 12:34.130
limits on it now. But we did a number of 
measurements of the eclipses, timings of the

12:34.710 --> 12:43.362
eclipses and occultations to get highly accurate 
positions. I'm also fascinated by chaos, by

12:44.524 --> 12:53.736
motions of chaotic objects, and whether chaos and 
instability go hand in hand. our chaotic orbits

12:54.695 --> 12:57.257
per force unstable. That's been my keen activity 
for the last number of years.

13:07.287 --> 13:15.054
Do you think that people who worked on the planets 
were considered second-class astronomers back

13:07.287 --> 13:15.054
when you started in this field? I have to say I can't 
give any specific examples, but my feeling is yes.

13:24.142 --> 13:31.188
Certainly in the interactions here, and I can name 
names if you like, but please do. I don't think

13:31.588 --> 13:33.150
people would object to this. Everyone

13:33.550 --> 13:47.101
who's been at Harvard will know, back in my day, 
that Bach was a marvelous man and very keen on

13:33.550 --> 13:47.101
talking with students and bringing them along. 
But he had very strong emotional responses, and I

13:48.102 --> 13:54.047
have to say, as we all do, I guess, prejudices as 
well. And certainly from him, as he was the first

13:55.225 --> 14:09.721
real astronomer whom I got to know here, there was 
the feeling that galactic or possibly

13:55.225 --> 14:09.721
extragalactic astronomy was the essence of 
things. And the other things were solar system was

14:10.702 --> 14:16.028
a backwater, which really didn't count for very 
much. And if one wanted to do anything or be

14:16.729 --> 14:24.658
marketable, to put it crassly, you certainly 
didn't pay much attention to the solar system. I'm

14:24.892 --> 14:29.016
not sure he put things in so many words, but the 
feeling was definitely there. Of course, he was

14:29.557 --> 14:33.901
riding the wave of radio astronomy, which was 
developing fast. And he had a very strong point

14:33.941 --> 14:37.165
that that was going to be a major field. And one 
might be well advised to become involved with it.

14:43.671 --> 14:44.893
But there was more than that. There was sly remarks 
that people who dealt with the solar system really

14:44.933 --> 14:54.122
were leftovers. not probably first-rate people 
in general, and that one really wasn't advancing

14:54.794 --> 15:05.251
the cause of astronomy if you lingered too long in 
the solar system. I think that's a fair statement.

15:07.955 --> 15:15.668
I can't, again, give you any specific examples, 
and I don't mean to saddle him as the only person who

15:07.955 --> 15:15.668
made these remarks. But I do associate them with 
him, and I think not unfairly. Do you think that

15:21.457 --> 15:26.383
these days, planetary astronomers have second 
class status? Again, I can't give any strong

15:28.585 --> 15:31.949
examples. But I generally feel that's the case. I 
think probably with some of the grand successes of

15:35.853 --> 15:46.165
the last decade or decade and a half, that feeling 
has been, in some sense, lessened. But I think

15:48.187 --> 15:58.242
that's probably true, that still planetary 
people are generally felt to be somewhat less than

15:48.187 --> 15:58.242
in the forefront.

16:01.206 --> 16:06.233
I sort of worry sometimes, at the center for 
astrophysics, we will lose this planetary group.

16:06.894 --> 16:09.919
I think under the present regime, that's 
unlikely. But I think had Erwin Shapiro not been

16:09.979 --> 16:14.505
the director, we very well might have 
disappeared. And maybe there's a good reason for

16:14.966 --> 16:17.029
that. I have to say, in general, I think planetary 
people are not regarded as the most significant in

16:17.448 --> 16:24.438
the astronomical community. Where did you get 
your funding for your work the last 30 years? The

16:31.507 --> 16:32.869
last few years? The last 30. Thanks, Ron. When I 
began here, the Smithsonian really had a mission,

16:36.935 --> 16:45.767
formally, to study what was in the solar system. 
The initial wording was that they studied

16:46.490 --> 16:55.359
material between the surface of the sun and the 
surface of the earth, which was very restrictive.

16:56.260 --> 16:59.923
Fred Whipple quickly got that expanded. But 
still, with Whipple and with this background,

17:00.203 --> 17:11.815
there was still definitely a

17:00.203 --> 17:11.815
feeling that our main concentration was in the 
solar system. In any event, since that was my

17:12.936 --> 17:16.159
interest, funding Smithsonian at that time was 
fairly easy to come by. I remember getting a couple

17:19.960 --> 17:22.744
grants to do assorted things. I guess the 
Earthshine was a grant that we had, and some other

17:22.785 --> 17:26.811
things, too. Some satellite astrometry that Cora 
and I had a grant for for a while. But at least at that

17:33.381 --> 17:36.205
time, funding was fairly easy. And since the 
Smithsonian's mission was mainly in the solar

17:36.506 --> 17:43.176
system, and there wasn't a great deal else being 
done in the solar system, Money came rather

17:43.409 --> 17:48.894
freely, I think, from SI itself, or SAO itself. And 
one, although was encouraged to get grants, and I

17:49.354 --> 17:56.060
guess I did from time to time, there wasn't a great 
deal of need to do that. In fact, one grant, I think

17:57.221 --> 18:01.865
from NASA, almost sought us out to do some of the 
work for them. It's a very different picture from

18:02.445 --> 18:05.348
now. What was your first NASA grant? And when was 
it? I think it was do this Earthshine work. It was a

18:12.991 --> 18:23.248
smallish grant, and it was to do some fairly 
comprehensive extensive photometry on the

18:12.991 --> 18:23.248
Earth, Sean, and that was probably back in the 
mid-60s. It lasted only for a couple of years, and I

18:23.469 --> 18:38.053
think it was a specific request from them to write 
the grant because they wanted this work done, and

18:23.469 --> 18:38.053
so we did it and then carried it through.

18:39.569 --> 18:49.342
What do you think NASA's impact has been, or NASA's 
money, has been on the field of planetary

18:39.569 --> 18:49.342
astronomy?

18:50.964 --> 18:56.231
I think it's been striking and valuable, and I'd 
say enormous. Just to go on from where we were

18:58.333 --> 19:05.343
before, Alan Cook and I put in to join the Voyager 
mission. Since we'd worked on Saturn's rings

19:06.424 --> 19:09.508
together, we joined it together. it turned out my 
interests were turning slightly at the time, and

19:10.096 --> 19:21.771
it turned out for a number of reasons to be 
appropriate for him to do most of the consulting

19:10.096 --> 19:21.771
and be the formal member of the Voyager team. But I 
followed along and checked a lot with him, and

19:22.653 --> 19:29.602
occasionally consulted and went out to JPL. But I 
just make the obvious remark that without NASA

19:31.424 --> 19:38.213
there would have been no Voyager, and without 
Voyager there would have been a totally different

19:39.053 --> 19:41.697
view of the solar system.

19:44.380 --> 19:51.550
Both for Smithsonian funding and for NASA 
funding, how have those funding sources treated

19:44.380 --> 19:51.550
you? Have they been nitpicking? Have they 
interfered? Or have they basically let you do what

19:54.654 --> 19:58.178
you said you were going to do? Ron, I've been very 
fortunate.

20:03.657 --> 20:09.145
essentially on the SAO staff, I guess you might say 
on the tenured staff, you can do pretty much what I

20:03.657 --> 20:09.145
like. It's true if I want a fancy computer, if I want 
to travel somewhere, I have to get funding, but I

20:10.167 --> 20:29.436
have been very fortunate of having a position 
which more resembles an academic position, so I

20:10.167 --> 20:29.436
can do what I like without having to go out and get 
funding to maintain myself. So I only need it for

20:32.328 --> 20:33.730
occasional special items. It's not a very good 
answer, but you see my position is a little bit

20:35.773 --> 20:42.021
different, because I haven't had to worry about 
this question directly. I think you included this

20:42.361 --> 20:45.646
earlier, but what are you working on right now? 
Right now, two projects, the tidal evolution of

20:46.207 --> 20:56.040
the Galilean satellites, and perhaps even more 
actively, chaos in the asteroid belt and the

20:46.207 --> 20:56.040
origin of Kirkwood Gaps. What, in your opinion, is 
the most important work you've done.

21:07.097 --> 21:11.822
I'm enormously excited about chaotic motion in 
the solar system. I hope it's important. A little

21:13.184 --> 21:24.737
group of us of three here have been keen on trying to 
establish the relation between measurements

21:13.184 --> 21:24.737
of chaos and eventual instability. And we think we 
see a fairly successful statistical relation

21:25.358 --> 21:31.765
between the two. It has to be checked further, but 
it seems to me significant both in a scientific and

21:32.487 --> 21:39.056
almost philosophical sense. I find it very 
exciting, perhaps because I'm on top of it now, but

21:40.077 --> 21:47.908
I really like this and I'm quite excited by it. It's 
an empirical relation to date, and one should try

21:48.228 --> 21:55.778
to establish more theoretical understanding, 
but I really I have to say what I'm doing just now on

21:56.467 --> 22:03.457
chaos and instability seems to me most 
interesting and possibly most enduring. Well,

22:04.278 --> 22:07.322
you also answered my next question, which is what 
was the most fun? Most wonderful fun, yes. Did you

22:09.746 --> 22:22.063
ever blunder or run into a stone wall or get 
entangled in some swampy mess that you said, oh, I

22:09.746 --> 22:22.063
wish I had never thought of this and never gone into 
it? I suppose so. This isn't a very good example,

22:25.458 --> 22:28.381
but let me give it anyway. Both by myself and with 
Alan Cook, we did work. And BepiColombo. I mustn't

22:34.448 --> 22:35.849
forget BepiColombo. We did do a number of studies 
of Saturn's rings. And toward the end, we were

22:40.755 --> 22:47.702
trying to understand better the structure of the 
rings in terms of the resonant interactions with

22:40.755 --> 22:47.702
the satellites. That obviously was very 
difficult. And it was with a certain sense of

22:50.885 --> 22:55.110
relief and delight I heard from Bill Ward that 
Peter Goldreich and Scott Tremaine were working

22:56.221 --> 23:25.705
on the project and would clean it up because, well, 
everybody knows their unique power, but I felt

22:56.221 --> 23:25.705
that I was unable to go sensibly any further, and 
the subject obviously needed more insight and

22:56.221 --> 23:25.705
more physical treatment, and it was nice that good 
people had gotten into the job and were going to do

22:56.221 --> 23:25.705
that. That's sort of an answer to your question, I 
think. I pretty much shot my bolt, I think, and was

23:31.003 --> 23:39.952
glad to turn it over to the major leagues.

23:44.096 --> 23:48.540
Just say the question once again, Ron, and I'll 
think again. Have you ever made any real blunders

23:48.600 --> 23:55.067
or gotten into a field where you weren't getting 
enough enough wasn't coming and you were hitting a

23:55.351 --> 24:05.065
dead end, or it didn't seem like the results were 
going to be worth the effort you put into it? Well,

24:05.706 --> 24:11.875
along the first part of your question, yes, there 
was one paper that never got published that was

24:05.706 --> 24:11.875
delightful that it never did. I think it was 
something that Alan Cook and I wrote, and this is

24:12.816 --> 24:19.386
back pre-Jim Elliott days. We had a fairly ornate 
and obviously fallacious reasoning why there

24:22.148 --> 24:28.695
weren't going to be any rings around the Planet 
Uranus. Saved by the bell. Saved by the bell. And we

24:30.917 --> 24:38.846
wrote a paper, which we sent off, and the referee 
with great wisdom and foresight said, this really

24:30.917 --> 24:38.846
isn't very persuasive. I don't think this should 
be published. This was maybe three or four years

24:41.268 --> 24:49.557
before Jim Elliot discovered the ring.

24:50.465 --> 25:09.047
It was based somehow, I think, on the feeling that 
because the inner satellites of Saturn were so

24:50.465 --> 25:09.047
prevalent, they seemed to define the boundaries 
of the ring, and there were no inner satellites

24:50.465 --> 25:09.047
around Uranus, not in the right positions anyway, 
probably any early Uranian ring would dissipate.

25:09.888 --> 25:18.598
Anyway, we gave the paper a terrible name called On 
the Absence of a Ring Around Uranus, which someone

25:09.888 --> 25:18.598
said sounded like a soap commercial. It's quite 
right. Anyway, the paper never got published, and

25:20.925 --> 25:28.737
you can imagine with what great relief I view that 
today. Where do you publish most, or where have you

25:28.877 --> 25:33.404
published in the past, and has that changed over 
the years? I guess most of the planetary work we've

25:34.466 --> 25:38.892
sent to Icarus.

25:41.957 --> 25:47.826
We had a little trouble with some of the referees on 
Icarus, and lately have been sending things more

25:41.957 --> 25:47.826
frequently to the Astronomical Journal. The work 
on chaos, I guess, has now had two or three papers

25:48.498 --> 25:52.142
there. But this is only,

25:54.003 --> 26:02.372
what shall I say, a glitch, or at least a temporary 
change. But Eckeres and the AJ have been the major

26:02.632 --> 26:06.476
repositories. Do you get the impression that the 
AFJ doesn't want work such as yours? Oh, no. No.

26:14.424 --> 26:17.847
Well, golly, this was some years ago.

26:19.649 --> 26:22.032
I'm at the urging of BepiColombo, basically. We 
went and reanalyzed some of the stratoscope

26:22.052 --> 26:28.281
observations of the shape of Uranus. This is, 
again, back before Voyager. Just before, though.

26:34.329 --> 26:36.532
Because of a number of reasons. Anyway, we went 
back with new equipment to reanalyze the data of

26:36.592 --> 26:43.581
Danielson. and found that, in fact, we could 
improve upon it substantially and derive an

26:44.692 --> 26:53.708
ellipticity or geometrical ablateness for 
Uranus. And I can't quite know the reason. This was

26:58.016 --> 27:02.564
a paper of Charlie Avis at the JPL, and Bethany 
Colombo, Erwin Shapiro, and I. We sent it to the

27:02.584 --> 27:08.455
APJ, I guess because that's where Danielson's 
first work. on Project Stratoscope had appeared,

27:09.245 --> 27:15.073
and it was published without great difficulty. So 
I don't suppose it's a journal that was first

27:15.113 --> 27:25.288
thought of in terms of planetary work, but this one 
seemed to be appropriate for there, and it was

27:15.113 --> 27:25.288
accepted. Do you think having a journal such as 
Icarus devoted just to planetary astronomy is a

27:26.510 --> 27:32.699
good thing? Well, one good thing, of course, is 
that it hasn't and all the other major

27:37.561 --> 27:41.085
astronomical journals do, and they're heavy page 
charges. So certainly, Icarus, I think, is a good

27:41.105 --> 27:48.412
journal from that technical reason. I agree, 
though, beyond that, that I think its focus is so

27:49.393 --> 28:00.123
strictly planetary, but broad planetary, both 
dynamics, optometry, its spectroscopy. I think

28:00.404 --> 28:02.386
it's a very, very good thing to have it. I'm very 
much an avid reader, although not a describer of

28:02.406 --> 28:06.690
Icarus. When we were graduate students, there was 
just an American Astronomical Society, period.

28:12.576 --> 28:17.943
Now there are a lot of sub-societies, and the 
Division for Planetary Sciences is one of them. Do

28:17.963 --> 28:20.446
you think that's a good deal or a bad deal? I think 
it's inevitable. So in that sense, it's good. It's

28:24.692 --> 28:33.483
just too diffuse now to have one society being 
concerned with the entire topic. That, in a sense,

28:33.503 --> 28:37.048
is regrettable, but it seems to me inevitable. in a 
sense, the result of a very healthy growth in all

28:37.113 --> 28:40.196
areas. We know, of course, now that simultaneous 
sessions occur at all Astronomical Society

28:42.058 --> 28:47.363
meetings. And I still like to go occasionally and 
just see some people and listen to some areas that

28:47.383 --> 28:54.990
aren't my own. That the AES meetings, I mean. But I 
think it's inevitable and necessary that this

28:58.534 --> 29:03.138
field be more focused. I'm unaware, anyway, of any 
great loss of generality or failure to keep up with

29:08.365 --> 29:14.671
things because of this separation.

29:17.434 --> 29:22.839
Not a very helpful answer, not a very unusual 
answer, but it seems to me hard to think of the lies.

29:22.859 --> 29:24.400
Well, that brings up the next question. You 
yourself, there's a lot of astronomers around

29:26.002 --> 29:29.305
CFA. Do you talk to the stellar and galactic and 
cosmological types, and do they ever talk to you

29:29.786 --> 29:37.613
besides saying hello when you pass in the hall? 
Yes. Yes, I think I can answer that very

29:39.944 --> 29:42.527
definitely.

29:50.537 --> 29:52.099
Well, I'll just give you an example. I've been 
serving for several years now on several

29:52.159 --> 30:01.510
committees, reviewing applications for 
postdoctoral fellowships and predoctoral

29:52.159 --> 30:01.510
fellowships. And it's a wonderful thing, because 
it gives me a chance to read over applications,

30:05.875 --> 30:11.820
talk with colleagues about subjects that I am 
somewhat familiar with, but not very familiar

30:05.875 --> 30:11.820
with. And I find that to be a demanding but 
rewarding exercise. So I can say, I guess, that in a

30:17.585 --> 30:25.792
group as large as this, perhaps these stimuli 
occur out of necessity. But they're, I find, very

30:25.832 --> 30:28.234
valuable. If it weren't for a little bit of 
pushing, I think I would probably become more

30:28.975 --> 30:35.781
narrow. But I think, again, the place as large as 
this with many, many journal clubs and talks,

30:36.689 --> 30:54.537
colloquia, and lunchtime gatherings, the 
ability to stay fairly general, at least in a

30:36.689 --> 30:54.537
somewhat shallow sense, is there. And that's very 
helpful and very nice. What are the biggest

30:59.304 --> 31:05.093
differences you see between planetary astronomy 
and this when you started in the early 60s and now?

31:09.839 --> 31:15.827
Well, certainly, the activity in the field is 
totally different. Back in the early 60s, there

31:15.928 --> 31:17.710
were very few people. You knew virtually 
everyone, or could know everyone.

31:24.921 --> 31:32.532
I think you felt, perhaps, at that time, you were 
united by the small numbers game you were a small

31:32.967 --> 31:37.292
cause in yourself, and you wanted to keep the 
lights burning.

31:39.916 --> 31:50.949
We've grown to such a degree that that feeling of 
being an endangered species, perhaps, is not

31:39.916 --> 31:50.949
quite so prevalent.

31:51.890 --> 32:01.422
I think, Ron, I have to say, too, that as I get older, 
I get somehow

31:51.890 --> 32:01.422
the feeling that since there isn't a huge amount of 
time left, perhaps I want to concentrate and do the

32:01.823 --> 32:07.731
things I want to do and I'm interested in. So I don't 
try to get so involved or so active in causes,

32:07.751 --> 32:21.952
promoting things, or worried about things that 
aren't sort of in my first line of interest. And at

32:22.352 --> 32:28.641
present, I'm keenest on the science itself, and so 
I'm not very active in committees or meetings or

32:29.954 --> 32:34.822
pushing various agendas. I like to do the science 
itself and have been rather selfish in that

32:35.082 --> 32:41.833
regard. What do you think the status of planetary 
astronomy is now? Growing, shrinking, or hanging

32:45.478 --> 32:47.501
in there?

32:52.329 --> 32:58.138
Well, I think it certainly grew so and produced a 
certain amount, perhaps, of well, perhaps lived

32:59.300 --> 33:01.623
in an unrealistic world. I guess it is probably 
shrinking. I do not believe it will ever go back or

33:06.408 --> 33:11.714
shrink to the level it was, say, after World War II.

33:14.857 --> 33:22.125
I think there's too much...

33:14.857 --> 33:22.125
What shall I say? There are too many interesting 
problems that are meanable to... observations or

33:29.455 --> 33:37.563
techniques or studies that are sufficiently 
rewarding and basic that the subject will

33:29.455 --> 33:37.563
certainly continue. And perhaps that was the 
problem back in the 30s and 40s, that there was just

33:37.623 --> 33:51.338
no tremendously advancing technique to solve 
many of the problems. Now we do have those, but

33:51.378 --> 33:55.682
maybe they'll have to be measured out in smaller 
doses, but I don't believe the field will

33:56.050 --> 34:11.803
disappear or be set back simply because the 
techniques to advance it are so powerful and the

33:56.050 --> 34:11.803
people are here to use them. I guess I look in terms 
of a settling back, some projects perhaps being

34:13.204 --> 34:25.855
put aside, but the questions are basic and the 
techniques are sufficiently advanced that the

34:13.204 --> 34:25.855
subject will not diminish greatly, I feel. Do you 
think planetary astronomers have done a good job

34:28.858 --> 34:34.486
of selling what they do to the public? In other 
words, do you think they presented their case well

34:34.506 --> 34:44.178
and actually affected the public thinking to any 
extent?

34:44.198 --> 34:46.661
I guess I would say they have done rather well. 
Again, I'm sorry, I don't think of any particular

34:47.402 --> 34:54.812
probing or exciting answer to that. If

34:55.518 --> 35:08.414
you'll forgive me for just giving you such a blank 
and unqualified answer, I would be rather

34:55.518 --> 35:08.414
impressed by what they've done. And I think the 
public relations have been really quite

35:09.095 --> 35:12.740
strikingly good. Do you think this idea of selling 
planetary astronomy as a practical science, for

35:14.722 --> 35:22.993
example, diverting killer asteroids, keeping 
the ozone in our upper atmosphere, stopping Earth

35:23.682 --> 35:29.710
from turning into Venus. Do you think that 
emphasis to get funding at the expense of other

35:31.433 --> 35:40.225
problems is good or bad, or the best that can be 
done, perhaps? My feeling is that if you don't

35:41.407 --> 35:47.055
argue honestly, you always regret it eventually, 
or someone will regret it eventually. And I think

35:48.136 --> 35:52.322
that Killer Asteroids is not an honest sell. 
Ozone, I suspect, to take your example, clearly

35:53.602 --> 35:58.629
is. I would only say that I think you have to make an 
honest, a brutally honest approach to the

35:59.630 --> 36:06.820
subject. And you will always regret it if you do 
not. So I would be skeptical about some of the

36:10.345 --> 36:14.671
selling techniques.

36:17.454 --> 36:20.959
Do you think that the failure to find life on Mars 
had an effect on funding for planetary astronomy

36:22.137 --> 36:25.922
in general? Oh, I suspect it did. Somehow a more 
positive in terms of life result would have

36:30.208 --> 36:38.559
accelerated our interest.

36:41.223 --> 36:52.077
Maybe we should have made a stronger point that the 
changes in the Martian obliquity leading

36:41.223 --> 36:52.077
possibly to periods of greater of unleashing 
various internal water supplies still left the

36:52.580 --> 36:58.532
question open. That's a possibility. But

37:00.797 --> 37:07.111
I'm sure the detection of life would mean a great 
infusion of money. Do you think the obliquity,

37:11.699 --> 37:15.207
changes in the Martian obliquity may have a 
tremendous climactic effect. Oh, yes. When they

37:15.769 --> 37:21.322
first got those pictures showing stream beds, 
they said, well, it might be some fluidized thing.

37:21.342 --> 37:22.925
And I just said, hell, it's water. Why not?
