00:04.587 --> 00:06.390
All right, a few recollections now. When did you 
first meet Heisman Ren? Came to JPL to interview

00:11.478 --> 00:14.402
for a job. And as the supervisor of the astronomy 
group, I did the interviewing. So that was in, I

00:21.914 --> 00:32.130
guess, sometime in 1961.

00:32.903 --> 00:34.445
What did you think of him when you first met him? 
Does not act like the public's typical image of

00:34.645 --> 00:39.451
what an astronomer should act like. No.

00:43.376 --> 00:47.982
But he had a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of bounce to 
him. He was obviously knowledgeable. And he was

00:50.405 --> 00:55.672
interested in working in a field where not too many 
people were interested in working. And that

00:56.513 --> 01:02.100
seemed more than adequate to me to offer the man a 
job. Later, of course, we became very close

01:02.215 --> 01:16.288
personal friends, and it's a little hard since 
I've been in touch with him all of the time for the

01:02.215 --> 01:16.288
past 30 years to really remember back to what I 
thought of him 30 years ago. I can't help, I can't

01:16.308 --> 01:23.554
separate that from the contemporary Spinrad, 
but... He got pretty unhappy here at JPL. He got

01:26.357 --> 01:29.640
unhappy here because he couldn't get telescope 
time. And he, when he came here, assumed that he

01:30.160 --> 01:39.343
would be treated like any other young astronomer, 
and he found out to the contrary. He found out that

01:39.403 --> 01:44.677
people were simply not giving time on large 
telescopes to do planetary projects. They were

01:44.737 --> 01:46.802
looked down upon. And he tried to mine the old plate 
vaults at Mount Wilson. They were willing to have

01:51.406 --> 01:53.028
him do that. But as far as getting new time at 
McDonald or Mount Wilson, no luck. So he started

02:03.157 --> 02:11.205
looking around, and when he got a job offer from his 
old alma mater, he left and went to Berkeley. Okay,

02:12.626 --> 02:13.887
let's... discuss the world's greatest planetary 
astrophysicist, Gerard Peter Kuiper. When did

02:20.488 --> 02:23.516
you first cross paths with him? Well, Kuiper was 
around the lab all of the time in the early days of

02:23.536 --> 02:29.833
the space program. Kuiper, of course, tended to 
look upon anyone at JPL as being a good guy, because

02:30.303 --> 02:48.208
to him the people at JPL were building the kinds of 
spacecraft that he was interested in, they were

02:30.303 --> 02:48.208
promoting the kind of work that he wanted to do, and 
they were potential sources of funds. And so

02:48.728 --> 02:53.475
anybody who worked at JPL was his friend. saw 
anyone he recognized from JPL at a meeting and he

02:53.860 --> 03:04.756
tended to back you into the corner and began to 
harangue you with his latest theories and ideas

02:53.860 --> 03:04.756
and he was a great guy. On the other hand, if you were 
on an opposing team, he could be a pretty wicked

03:04.796 --> 03:10.345
player. I don't remember when I first met him. I 
know he came to the lab regularly. We had meetings

03:16.214 --> 03:21.842
with him throughout the period from say 59 on. But I 
couldn't give you an exact date. How about Girard

03:26.011 --> 03:28.836
de Vaucouleur? Well, I worked with de Vaucouleur 
on committees that were set up by NASA to look into

03:31.221 --> 03:44.505
the need for planetary telescopes.

03:44.671 --> 04:00.153
I attended these meetings, usually with Al Hibbs, 
sometimes not, but people involved included Al

03:44.671 --> 04:00.153
Wilson, DeVocalor, Stan Greenfield, who I guess 
was with Rand Corporation at the time. We

04:01.936 --> 04:10.408
sometimes met with people like, I don't know, what 
was his name, Edson, I guess it was, who was... at

04:10.777 --> 04:16.884
the Pentagon at the time as a civilian scientist at 
the Pentagon.

04:19.367 --> 04:31.321
Anyway, I met de Vaucouleur working on these 
various teams together where we were trying to get

04:19.367 --> 04:31.321
support for a NASA building, one or more large 
planetary telescopes. And he was, of course, very

04:32.202 --> 04:37.628
enthused about his Mars work at the time. met with 
him often and enjoyed his company very much.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.924
Tell me billions and billions of things about Carl 
Sagan. Well, Carl, of course, was a graduate

04:52.746 --> 04:58.292
student of Kuiper's when Kuiper first went to 
Arizona. In fact, I guess he was a graduate student

04:58.613 --> 05:03.598
before Kuiper went to Arizona. followed him there 
from Chicago. I guess Carl's PhD is actually still

05:06.250 --> 05:11.177
a Chicago PhD since he began it there. But I called 
Kuiper one day and said, gee, we've been

05:13.379 --> 05:30.262
interested in ideas about solar system cosmology 
and the origin of the solar system and a lot of

05:13.379 --> 05:30.262
disagreement on this, but you've done a lot of work 
in the field. Could you sort of give us, write us a

05:30.282 --> 05:33.366
position paper that tells us what at least your 
current ideas are on where things stand with our

05:33.717 --> 05:45.113
knowledge of how the solar system originally, how 
it originated. And he said, gee, I wish I could. But

05:48.538 --> 05:49.580
I'm awfully busy. However, I've got this very, 
very bright young graduate student named Carl

05:49.640 --> 05:54.807
Sagan. And I'm sure he'd do a bang-up job for you. 
And he really needs the money. He's very poor. And

06:00.836 --> 06:03.640
he'd do a great job. work out well all around. And so 
I said, well, fine, sure. We'll let Carl work on

06:07.767 --> 06:09.329
this. And so we met Carl. He was, of course, working 
on his thesis on the greenhouse model of the Venus

06:13.576 --> 06:17.623
atmosphere. And after he had pretty well along, 
why, he came up to the lab and gave us a seminar on the

06:18.384 --> 06:26.077
greenhouse model of the Venus atmosphere. And we 
all met him.

06:32.543 --> 06:33.524
known him ever since. Was he self-assured even 
then? He was pretty self-confident, even in those

06:35.967 --> 06:41.233
days, yes, very much so for a graduate student. 
Yeah, he was always a very confident person, but

06:41.853 --> 06:46.618
not overbearing or anything. He was just quite 
sure of what he did. Where

06:50.242 --> 06:57.150
did you first meet Harlan Smith, and what did you 
think of him when you saw him? Harlan Smith, to me at

06:58.565 --> 07:04.331
the time, seemed one of the senior astronomers of 
the world. I don't remember where I first met

07:04.831 --> 07:07.133
Harlan. I remember many incidents where I was with 
him, like just the two of us had dinner together at

07:07.654 --> 07:25.551
Snowmass, Colorado, when we were both there for a 
meeting of the National Academy Solar System

07:07.654 --> 07:25.551
Exploration Committee. I talked to him many times 
at meetings of

07:26.577 --> 07:37.930
the American Astronomical Society or of the 
Planetary Sciences Division. He, of course,

07:39.231 --> 07:43.976
hosted a couple of meetings of the Planetary 
Sciences Division at Austin. I ran into him in many

07:45.878 --> 07:51.184
places, but I really don't remember where I first 
met Harlan or when. But it was always a great

07:51.745 --> 07:54.508
pleasure to talk to him. I always felt that 
although he was a very senior man in the field, that

07:54.995 --> 08:06.166
he always treated everyone as if they were equal 
and seemed to respect other people's opinions. He

08:06.386 --> 08:21.201
was always an exciting person to talk to, and that 
he was always full of both ideas about astronomy

08:06.386 --> 08:21.201
and knowledge of the current political situation 
and trying to get new telescopes or new probes or

08:06.386 --> 08:21.201
whatever underway. And I was always very happy 
when I could could sit down and talk to him. The last

08:27.198 --> 08:32.106
time I saw him was at the AAS meeting in Pasadena 
about five years ago. And there he grabbed me and

08:33.048 --> 08:45.307
said he had this very bright young woman who was 
about to get her PhD at Texas and wondered if there

08:33.048 --> 08:45.307
might be any place for her at JPL. It was Jackie 
Green. And I met Jackie, talked to her, and was very

08:48.232 --> 08:52.018
much impressed by her. It turns out she went to 
Hawaii for a couple of years, but she is, in fact,

08:52.454 --> 08:58.202
now at JPL. But he was looking after his graduate 
students, as he always did, and making a good case

08:58.222 --> 09:03.670
for them. Actually, I don't think she was his 
student. I think she was Roman Smolakowski's

09:06.974 --> 09:09.157
student. But she was there in the department, and 
he was looking out for them. Tell me something

09:15.767 --> 09:17.449
about Roger Hoare.

09:21.496 --> 09:23.679
Didn't have a close relationship with Roger. Knew 
Roger when he was at headquarters. Served on a

09:25.863 --> 09:27.385
committee or two with him. Was never close to 
Roger. Never had any private dinners with him or

09:28.868 --> 09:34.196
anything like that. Couldn't really tell you much 
about Roger. Maybe you can tell me something about

09:38.523 --> 09:41.327
Nancy Roman. Oh, I could tell you some things about 
Nancy, yes. Nancy and I served together on the

09:45.544 --> 09:51.631
Astronomy Subcommittee of NASA from 1960 to 62. 
Nancy, of course, chaired that committee, so in a

09:52.712 --> 09:56.577
sense I worked for her. I was JPL's delegate for the 
first two years to that august group. Bill Brunk

10:04.628 --> 10:14.217
for part of that time was the representative from 
Lewis Research Center, where he worked at the

10:04.628 --> 10:14.217
time, then left when he went back to finish his PhD. 
We had a lot of outstanding consultants on it. And

10:17.280 --> 10:19.562
that's another story in and of itself. But I worked 
with Nancy fairly closely for two years. And to be

10:24.027 --> 10:30.433
blunt about it, I was not always happy with Nancy. I 
think the thing that really frosted me was her

10:31.730 --> 10:42.663
very, very down-the-nose attitude toward solar 
system astronomy generally. She felt that it was

10:43.204 --> 10:47.449
very distinctly inferior to stellar and galactic 
work. And I remember when we had a meeting of the

10:47.889 --> 10:55.138
committee at the lab one time, she sort of took me 
aside and said, rather confidentially, that

10:55.625 --> 11:04.813
she'd been talking to Ira Bowen and that he had 
agreed that there were still some things that

10:55.625 --> 11:04.813
could be done from the ground in planetary 
astronomy. And she gave me this information as if

11:04.893 --> 11:22.549
it were a great discovery and something that, boy, 
wasn't this interesting, that the great man, the

11:04.893 --> 11:22.549
director of Mount Wilson and Palomar 
Observatory, actually said there were still some

11:04.893 --> 11:22.549
things that could be done from the ground in solar 
system astronomy. And she was very surprised by

11:23.350 --> 11:25.632
this. Well, I was promoting within the astronomy 
committee the need for NASA to build their own

11:26.422 --> 11:39.222
planetary telescope because of the difficulty of 
getting time. And I remember a meeting we had at

11:40.584 --> 11:44.009
Ames. I guess it was the last meeting that I 
represented the lab. I'd served my two years.

11:49.675 --> 11:53.706
People present included, for example, Jesse 
Greenstein as a consultant. We had on that

11:54.929 --> 12:00.884
committee people like Freeman Dyson, for 
example, as a consultant to the committee. There

12:00.904 --> 12:02.288
were a lot of big names there. Anyway, I made my 
pitch. It probably took 10 minutes saying why I

12:06.483 --> 12:11.711
felt it was important that NASA build their own 
planetary telescope. She turned to Gary Mulders,

12:13.294 --> 12:16.879
who was representing the National Science 
Foundation. Well, what do you think about this?

12:18.241 --> 12:26.674
And Mulders said that, well, he agreed totally 
with what I had said, that the NSF could not support

12:18.241 --> 12:26.674
building additional telescopes. They were hard 
pressed to keep up with their requirements as they

12:26.714 --> 12:30.921
were. and that he thought NASA indeed should go 
ahead and build their own planetary telescope,

12:31.323 --> 12:38.213
that they should support planetary astronomy. So 
she asked Jesse Greenstein, and Greenstein said,

12:38.773 --> 12:43.240
well, yeah, I quite agree. There are a number of 
things, useful things that can be done from the

12:43.480 --> 12:46.685
ground yet. NASA ought to do them. They're not 
going to get enough time to do them on existing

12:48.707 --> 12:54.295
telescopes, and yeah, they should do it. Well, I 
went away feeling really good. I mean, the whole

12:57.359 --> 12:59.002
committee had backed me up. NASA ought to build a 
telescope. Well, that was my last meeting. But

13:03.950 --> 13:07.955
somebody else then later showed me the minutes of 
that meeting. And nowhere in those minutes of that

13:08.235 --> 13:17.346
meeting do you ever find any part of this 
discussion that strongly supports NASA building

13:08.235 --> 13:17.346
a planetary telescope. And that really frosted 
me. That had just been written out of the minutes.

13:24.895 --> 13:31.924
Tell me something about Bill Brunk, who actually 
ran the Ground-Based Planetary Astronomy for

13:24.895 --> 13:31.924
longer than everybody else put together, I guess. 
Yeah, I think that's true. And Bill and I, of

13:35.923 --> 13:47.420
course, met each other when we were 
representatives from JPL and from Lewis on this

13:35.923 --> 13:47.420
initial Nancy Roman Planetary Astronomy. Or not 
Planetary Astronomy, but this was the Astronomy

13:47.440 --> 13:57.455
Subcommittee, which included, at that time, 
solar system astronomy, solar astronomy,

13:47.440 --> 13:57.455
stellar and galactic astronomy. It covered all of 
astronomy.

14:02.009 --> 14:09.341
So that we got to be friends and work together on 
that

14:02.009 --> 14:09.341
committee. And then he left to go back and finish 
his PhD, and then came back to headquarters as an

14:09.361 --> 14:16.833
employee. And Bill and I worked together closely 
over the years. He was my program manager when I was

14:21.401 --> 14:27.831
leader of the International Halley Watch, and he 
We always got along well together. I think he

14:31.857 --> 14:35.142
supported me pretty well. I have no real 
complaints about that. I often felt, however,

14:39.368 --> 14:57.293
that as people seem to do when they spend a long 
period of time in Washington, DC, I think they tend

14:39.368 --> 14:57.293
to lose touch with the realities in the field, as it 
were, and in the field of astronomy. And they tend

14:57.754 --> 15:00.197
to become more concerned about How do I fit what I 
want to do within my budget? And how do I satisfy the

15:03.474 --> 15:05.277
boss? Then am I suggesting what's best for 
astronomy? And so I often disagreed with him on

15:11.364 --> 15:18.873
whether he was really doing what was best for the 
field. I felt he was out of touch at times. But he

15:21.476 --> 15:27.464
tended to annoy me a little sometimes. But we 
always got along well. Do you think planetary

15:30.181 --> 15:32.424
astronomy is mined out? No. I think there are, as 
long as the planets have atmospheres, those

15:35.929 --> 15:42.478
atmospheres are going to change. We don't even 
understand our own, let alone the atmospheres of

15:42.518 --> 15:45.703
the other planets. I think continuing study of the 
major planets is certainly in order. Until we have

15:50.950 --> 15:56.037
some kind of permanent presence in orbit around 
Mars or something, there's some work perhaps yet

15:56.742 --> 16:18.848
to be done on Mars, but I think particularly in the 
small bodies of the solar system, there are so many

15:56.742 --> 16:18.848
of them that even if we eventually get missions to a 
few of them, one or a comet or two, a few asteroids,

15:56.742 --> 16:18.848
there are so many of them out there that the only way 
that it's ever all going to be tied together is from

15:56.742 --> 16:18.848
a ground-based study of these objects. And I think 
even solar system planetary astronomy has got a

16:23.894 --> 16:32.625
lot of future ahead of it because of the 
impossibility of doing it all from space. What's

16:34.989 --> 16:38.153
the position of planetary astronomy at JPL right 
now? I think there is a little sense of dread, a

16:40.896 --> 16:46.864
sense of Maybe we've seen the best days of it. I 
think there's a morale problem at JPL today, to be

16:50.183 --> 16:54.228
perfectly frank. The lab has generally been an 
ebullient place to work, a place where everybody

16:55.429 --> 17:09.828
sort of felt that the sky was the limit, upward and 
onward, we're doing great things, and next year

16:55.429 --> 17:09.828
we're going to do even greater ones. I think that 
was true for many years. And I think there has now

17:12.592 --> 17:16.277
come a realization that... This isn't going to 
continue to happen quite that way. We're being

17:21.232 --> 17:29.584
forced, probably correctly, to do business in 
different ways in the sense that the

17:21.232 --> 17:29.584
multi-billion dollar missions are just not going 
to be flown. We've got to fly smaller missions.

17:32.087 --> 17:34.891
There is a change of direction. This always means 
some heartbreak for people who have been involved

17:34.951 --> 17:43.002
in the old way of doing business for a time. And I 
think among the planetary people in general, the

17:46.565 --> 17:55.260
lack of support, we've seen the loss of a number of 
very good people simply because they can no longer

17:46.565 --> 17:55.260
get their ground-based work funded. And I think 
there's a certain loss of morale and a fear of the

17:55.280 --> 18:03.394
future, perhaps, rather than an eagerness for the 
future. It's not a palpable thing exactly, but

18:05.658 --> 18:09.966
everybody's concerned. Let's put it that way. 
Well, that also answers what was going to be my next

18:11.827 --> 18:17.655
question, what do you think of the future? But 
again, this has got to be a guess, but you'll recall

18:17.695 --> 18:30.191
in the past there were always been rumors they were 
going to close JPL and make it the foothill campus

18:17.695 --> 18:30.191
of Pasadena City College or something like that. 
And of course, NASA does have big budgets. In the

18:34.256 --> 18:41.766
long-term future, do you see JPL around in 20 
years, and do you see any planetary astronomy

18:34.256 --> 18:41.766
being done at JPL if it's still here? I think JPL 
will still be here in 20 years, yeah. I think it'll

18:46.122 --> 18:48.705
be a rather different place than it is today. I 
think it won't have the outriggers that it does

18:48.725 --> 18:54.993
today, that is the least space around town. I think 
it'll probably all be here on one campus, so to

18:55.053 --> 19:00.701
speak, except for the computing facility at 
Woodbury. I think that the missions that we fly

19:02.002 --> 19:10.774
will be smaller, perhaps a bit more often than the 
big missions, but much smaller missions. I think

19:11.294 --> 19:27.504
that there will perhaps be a tauter,

19:11.294 --> 19:27.504
tighter management in the sense that I think that 
you'll find more a skunkworks approach to things.

19:28.125 --> 19:33.555
You won't throw people at a project, so to speak.

19:34.244 --> 19:37.908
just doing things a little differently than 
they've traditionally been done at the lab. And I

19:37.949 --> 19:42.955
think the same thing is true of ground-based 
astronomy. I think there will always remain

19:42.995 --> 19:49.863
people here in the field, but I think that the 
number may be somewhat smaller. And I think that

19:50.824 --> 20:00.436
most people, instead of being able to spend 100% 
time on research, there's almost nobody doing

19:50.824 --> 20:00.436
that now even, although there were years ago. I 
think you'll find everybody will have maybe half

20:03.657 --> 20:08.506
time working on one of these projects, half time on 
their research. I think JPL will continue to

20:09.629 --> 20:19.167
exist, will continue to be a very reputable and 
enjoyable, even, place to work. But I think that

20:19.748 --> 20:25.800
the feeling of youthful enthusiasm

20:27.434 --> 20:30.538
Well, at least among some of us older ones, it isn't 
there anymore. We're not so young anymore is

20:30.558 --> 20:33.062
perhaps the answer to that. I shouldn't really 
answer for what some of the new young people coming

20:33.162 --> 20:39.872
in may think about it. Since planetary astronomy 
got back into high gear about 30 years or so ago,

20:39.932 --> 20:51.248
what do you think the taxpayers have gotten out of

20:39.932 --> 20:51.248
it? I think there have been a number of useful 
things that have come out of the program, and you

20:51.498 --> 20:58.727
can go at this many, many different levels. I think 
they've gotten a sense of almost a competition

20:59.849 --> 21:09.781
with the Soviets, and I think that the American 
public generally enjoys a good contest. I think

21:10.422 --> 21:12.605
they've got the feeling that we won some of it. I 
think they've been excited and had their minds

21:12.645 --> 21:17.691
opened a little bit by some of the discoveries. I 
think that's good. Clearly the advances in

21:20.866 --> 21:33.379
miniaturization and computing and so on that were 
necessary for a lot of our space activities have

21:20.866 --> 21:33.379
been carried on into regular commercial life. One 
might argue that perhaps the Japanese have made

21:34.119 --> 21:44.910
better use of these discoveries than we have in the 
commercial sector, but certainly people have

21:45.565 --> 21:49.150
very cheap, extremely potent desk computers 
today. I don't know how much of this would have

21:49.190 --> 21:53.716
happened without the space program. Maybe it 
would have happened anyway, but certainly I would

21:53.756 --> 21:57.842
feel it wouldn't have happened as soon. And I think 
this is true in the medical field. I think there

22:01.607 --> 22:08.417
have been a lot of great advances, 
miniaturization and so on, application of laser

22:09.140 --> 22:15.707
technology and so on, some of which was developed 
within the space program that's being applied

22:09.140 --> 22:15.707
here on Earth. I think just trying to open young 
people's eyes to the universe, to the

22:18.290 --> 22:39.113
impressiveness, the fascination of it, to give 
them the impression that there's something more

22:18.290 --> 22:39.113
important out there than accounting or or 
belonging to a gang is important. It gives the

22:43.209 --> 22:59.389
people, the young people, a sense of place in the 
universe and that maybe there's something that

22:43.209 --> 22:59.389
they can go out and do that will add to the good of the 
world as opposed to just simply being consumers. I

22:59.509 --> 23:01.292
don't know. What do you think modern planetary 
astronomy has done for astronomy as a whole?

23:09.653 --> 23:11.738
Hmm, haven't thought about that one. You think 
it's shaken them up a little bit? Oh, it probably

23:15.989 --> 23:17.212
has. I'm sure there's been some instrumentation 
that's been developed by planetary people for use

23:17.292 --> 23:24.591
on space probes that's been applied to 
telescopes. I think a lot of the development,

23:25.111 --> 23:40.033
though, has been military and then has dribbled 
down into both planetary and classical galactic

23:25.111 --> 23:40.033
and stellar astronomy rather than any direct 
exchange just between the branches of astronomy.

23:40.594 --> 23:47.424
Well, in addition to that, I'm thinking of 
theories of star formation, which now, I guess,

23:40.594 --> 23:47.424
have to include planets. Well, that's certainly 
true. I mean, the discovery of the dust and what

23:48.966 --> 23:54.915
have you around... several stars on Fomalhaut, I 
guess, and Beta Pictoris was the first one, yeah.

24:03.340 --> 24:10.228
And I guess there's some hints of material around 
Vega.

24:11.289 --> 24:15.914
That certainly has, they've interacted, let's 
put it that way.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.700
Well, as I said, Solar system astronomers, 
planetary astronomers, and stellar astronomers

24:21.288 --> 24:35.986
do talk to each other today, and I think have some 
appreciation of the work that each other is doing,

24:21.288 --> 24:35.986
and I think that both fields are more fruitful for 
it. This is getting awfully general now, but what

24:36.006 --> 24:40.512
do you think planetary astronomy has done for 
science as a whole? I mean, it's obviously

24:41.974 --> 24:50.164
affected something like biology, and I don't know 
about geology and meteorology. I don't know about

24:50.549 --> 24:53.153
chemistry so much. Well, what do you think? Well, 
sure. Again, one of the things that the space

24:56.738 --> 25:06.714
program in general has done is made us aware of the 
fragileness of our own environment. And clearly,

25:06.954 --> 25:12.923
if you're going to understand the Earth's 
atmosphere, those same theories ought to apply to

25:06.954 --> 25:12.923
other planets. And so we've got a number of test 
subjects now where we can try to apply general

25:13.023 --> 25:19.273
meteorological theories. which I'm sure that 
studies of atmosphere of Venus and the major

25:19.996 --> 25:33.498
planets have had impact on our studies of our own 
atmosphere. Clearly, the studies toward the

25:35.200 --> 25:44.856
planet Earth, as NASA now puts it, are of great and 
even grave interest to the future of the human

25:35.200 --> 25:44.856
race. Considerations of the greenhouse effect of 
the ozone holes have a lot to say about whether

25:46.102 --> 25:53.094
we'll even survive. And, of course, ultimately 
there is the job of mapping out the small

25:53.254 --> 26:04.292
near-Earth asteroids to the extent that if one 
really does threaten the Earth, maybe we can do

25:53.254 --> 26:04.292
something about it in the future. It isn't to say we 
ought to mount any program now to do it. But what we

26:08.090 --> 26:19.526
ought to be doing is trying to find all of these 
bodies so we know if any of them are going to become a

26:08.090 --> 26:19.526
threat and they have an impact on everything, 
every person's life in that sense. But as far as

26:20.107 --> 26:28.298
direct impacts on science,

26:20.107 --> 26:28.298
all science is a unity, really. And I've just not 
thought about the direct interchanges, say,

26:28.778 --> 26:35.768
between astronomy and chemistry or science. had 
enormous impacts on physics, clearly. I mean, the

26:38.414 --> 26:46.434
interactions between astronomy and physics, 
they're one. Astronomy is just physics applied to

26:47.476 --> 26:52.930
the study of extraterrestrial subjects. You 
often hear the statements made, such as, you know,

26:53.467 --> 27:09.505
the space program has given us a view of the Earth as 
seen from outside as a planet, and studies

26:53.467 --> 27:09.505
round-basting probes of other planets have 
shown, yeah, it is just another planet, but unique

26:53.467 --> 27:09.505
and so forth. But do you think the public has really 
changed its attitude towards, or the way it thinks

27:10.066 --> 27:21.178
about Earth, or just changed its attitude, 
period? I think there has been a change. I think the

27:23.906 --> 27:37.502
average man in the street doesn't stop to think 
each day that he should be concerned about whether

27:23.906 --> 27:37.502
the earth is heating up or whether the ozone hole is 
going to cause him to have skin cancer or not. But

27:38.463 --> 27:51.199
certainly among those who read the daily 
newspapers or weekly news magazines or even those

27:38.463 --> 27:51.199
who listen to the TV news cannot help but be much 
more aware of their world and of the fragile nature

27:51.567 --> 28:06.389
of that world as a result of the space program, and 
in particular of various kinds of solar system

27:51.567 --> 28:06.389
studies. They have to be more aware of it and more 
concerned about it. I mean, in the past, man is

28:11.125 --> 28:16.672
largely worried about warfare, man against man. 
But now I think he is finally becoming very aware,

28:16.872 --> 28:33.031
or should be, that he may be doing himself in with 
some of his activities, both as to use of resources

28:16.872 --> 28:33.031
and his disposal of materials. When you meet 
people, say strangers, say on an airplane,

28:35.234 --> 28:38.938
they're sitting next to you, What's a reaction 
when they find out what you do for a living? Most of

28:43.398 --> 28:45.040
them, oh, gee, that's interesting. And then they 
usually think a minute, and, gee, have you heard

28:45.641 --> 28:59.982
about and something that they've read somewhere 
or heard somewhere and were kind of curious about,

28:45.641 --> 28:59.982
and can you tell me anything about thus and so? 
That's often happened. They're usually

29:02.946 --> 29:04.148
fascinated. So... So at least in your experience, 
it's a positive image. I would say so, yeah.

29:14.228 --> 29:23.356
Originally, and for the first few decades, JPL was 
just strictly, let's face it, working for the Army

29:14.228 --> 29:23.356
as a contractor developing weapons. When you 
first came here, was that still a situation? Yes.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.044
OK. When did JPL get handed over to the Army? Well, 
we did, of course, work with the Army in putting up

29:38.791 --> 29:47.204
the initial explorers. And then when we were 
talking with the Army and with the defense people

29:48.105 --> 30:03.969
about doing additional space-type missions that 
were more researched than anything else before

29:48.105 --> 30:03.969
NASA came into existence. But NASA then, of 
course, was founded. Immediately, they were told

30:09.335 --> 30:23.867
that they could take over existing laboratories 
if the laboratories were willing to be taken over

30:09.335 --> 30:23.867
to work with them on the space program that had been 
proposed. So they said, well, since we had worked

30:24.505 --> 30:32.474
on the explorers, where the obvious place to turn 
to, they'd like to have JPL. And people at JPL were

30:32.514 --> 30:34.957
very enthused about this. Most of the people here 
felt they'd much rather work on studies of the

30:35.057 --> 30:51.216
solar system than they would work on military 
field artillery, long-range field rockets, and

30:35.057 --> 30:51.216
that kind of thing, especially since that 
knowledge was applicable to the new space program

30:35.057 --> 30:51.216
as well. So that by... The end of 58, everybody here 
was very enthused about being a part of NASA. I

30:58.714 --> 31:04.729
think it was in 58 that NASA took us over then with 
great enthusiasm on everybody's part here. Not

31:04.769 --> 31:13.429
that we disliked the Army people we worked for, and 
I mean, in some ways, working for the Army was a

31:04.769 --> 31:13.429
rather pleasant experience in that we had a real 
skunk works approach to things in those days and

31:14.185 --> 31:39.130
the army would sort of come in with a bucket of money 
and suggest that we do some work in an area and the

31:14.185 --> 31:39.130
people here would kind of decide how the money 
should be spent and if there were a lot of money in

31:14.185 --> 31:39.130
the bucket at the end of the year no one was 
concerned about it that there might be any less the

31:14.185 --> 31:39.130
next year because we hadn't spent at all I mean they 
spent what they had to spend to get the job done and

31:39.380 --> 31:46.876
And if the bucket ran dry for some reason, why, 
they'd simply go back to the Army and say, hey, you

31:39.380 --> 31:46.876
know, can you fill up the bucket partway again? And 
usually the bucket would get filled up. And nobody

31:49.421 --> 31:58.300
was concerned in those days about which charge 
number to charge this hour's work to, or it was just

31:59.140 --> 32:07.088
There were broad tasks being assigned at JPL, and 
the people here decided how best to carry them out,

31:59.140 --> 32:07.088
and the money always seemed available. So in that 
sense, the working relationship was great. It was

32:11.232 --> 32:12.033
ideal. But, of course, the work being done was work 
on missiles like the Sergeant, for example. So the

32:20.101 --> 32:24.625
whole idea of converting our expertise over to 
Learning more about the solar system was just, I

32:24.942 --> 32:31.965
don't know, I think everybody reacted with great 
enthusiasm, with a few exceptions.
