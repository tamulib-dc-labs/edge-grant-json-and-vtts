WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:09.865
We know that a lot of students, or some students 
anyway, had part-time jobs, and I believe you

00:01.735 --> 00:09.865
mentioned earlier at one point that you, I 
believe, worked in the library. C.C. Yeats was a

00:11.587 --> 00:25.384
senior my first year, and he asked me if I wanted to 
work in the chem lab with him, and I took the job for

00:11.587 --> 00:25.384
15 or 20 cents an hour. I don't know what it was. And 
the next year, I'd been in the library so much, I got

00:33.140 --> 00:39.867
to voluntarily helping doing things, 
straightening up things. And so the lady in charge

00:40.588 --> 00:47.415
asked me if I wanted the job, and I took it for 20 
cents an hour. And I kept those jobs through my

00:47.455 --> 00:53.701
senior year, not in chemistry, only my junior, 
senior year. But the last year in college, I still

00:54.482 --> 01:00.328
worked in the, didn't work in either one of them, 
actually. the last year I was there, when I went

01:00.933 --> 01:08.162
back in January 1919.

01:09.223 --> 01:22.519
But

01:09.223 --> 01:22.519
I made my expenses at $0.20 an hour on average 
working in either chemistry or in the library

01:09.223 --> 01:22.519
during that period. I got some help from home. All I 
asked for, I wouldn't ask for it because I wanted to

01:26.124 --> 01:30.349
do it on my own. since I'd been out of school four 
years before I went to A&M. My money was lost in a

01:35.617 --> 01:43.809
bank failure in Fort Worth three months before 
school opened, and I was broke after saving for

01:35.617 --> 01:43.809
four years. That must have been quite a blow. Yep. 
Did the athletes on campus when you were there

01:49.178 --> 01:54.646
receive any particularly special treatment?

01:57.651 --> 01:59.053
Only into the that they had a separate table, I 
think, in the dormitory. But as for special favors

02:04.057 --> 02:08.404
to athletes, I don't think there were any. 
Basically, they had to make the drill and abide by

02:08.764 --> 02:12.269
the rules that the rest of you did. They had to 
abide. Well, some rules they drilled and things of

02:14.172 --> 02:17.637
that kind. Some of it they got out of. Didn't have to 
do it. But I don't think there was any special

02:20.562 --> 02:25.409
effort to get out of anything. Were a goodly 
percentage of them on scholarship? I don't think

02:28.480 --> 02:30.723
there was any scholarships at that time. In my 
impression, there wasn't. I think they were all

02:33.046 --> 02:34.528
there on their own. They just were there for the fun 
of it. Yeah, they just, there were no

02:36.431 --> 02:40.496
scholarships. I never heard of a scholarship 
while I was at A&M College. Okay. In looking

02:46.284 --> 02:54.015
through your senior yearbook, I noticed that you 
were a member of the, I guess it's K-E-B-L-E,

02:46.284 --> 02:54.015
Keeble Club. The Keeble Club was an organization. 
I don't know who started it. It was in existence

03:01.148 --> 03:03.171
before I got there. It was started by a group of 
Episcopal students. Keeble was one of the

03:07.938 --> 03:16.950
outstanding Roman Catholic, I guess you'd call 
him a missionary. I can't give you his history.

03:18.552 --> 03:19.113
I've forgotten. I hadn't heard of that in so long. 
But the opposite was for the Catholic boys. And

03:26.260 --> 03:32.731
theirs is the, oh, my memory's terrible. The 
Catholic boys had their own, and the name they

03:32.751 --> 03:48.015
selected was the great scholastic

03:32.751 --> 03:48.015
minister who was an Episcopalian. It went over to 
Catholic. Keeble was Catholic, went over to

03:50.546 --> 03:52.929
Episcopalian. Now, that's a rough history of that 
back there. But we met once a month in a dormitory

03:56.454 --> 04:01.080
room. But

04:02.041 --> 04:10.412
the local minister from downtown would come out 
and visit with us. And we'd talk generalities.

04:12.795 --> 04:18.222
There wasn't any religious activities connected 
with it. And that's the only thing I remember about

04:18.961 --> 04:20.763
that. Of course, we had a Fort Worth club. It met 
once or two or three times a year. So we'd recognize

04:26.368 --> 04:27.789
each other. At that time, I knew everybody from 
Fort Worth. But they've all disappeared. And

04:35.256 --> 04:37.738
let's see, you were also in the SAA. That was what? 
FAA? SAA. Student Agricultural Association or

04:41.301 --> 04:44.103
something? It was something like that, but I don't 
remember any activities connected with it. What

04:48.931 --> 04:50.753
about the horticultural society? We had a 
horticultural society, which only met once or

04:51.053 --> 04:54.657
twice. I've

04:55.819 --> 05:02.266
forgotten what we did, actually. I don't remember 
even the members of it. I'd have to look in the . I

05:06.631 --> 05:09.514
assume it was primarily horticulture. Yeah. 
Earlier, you sort of summarized your career from

05:11.857 --> 05:17.183
graduation. work in China, and at one point while 
we had the mic off, you were telling me something

05:17.602 --> 05:30.301
about the one factor which influenced your 
decision to go to China, about the lecturer who was

05:17.602 --> 05:30.301
on campus. Yes, Frank N. Myers, who gave his 
lecture on his experiences in China, and I

05:30.321 --> 05:46.225
experienced many of the same things on my own, 
because I've walked across China twice myself,

05:30.321 --> 05:46.225
and but not in the area that he had been, that he 
reflected to me, because he was in northwest China

05:46.829 --> 05:57.421
where an ox cart was possible. I have never lived in 
China where an ox cart was possible. I've had

06:01.746 --> 06:12.499
either sedan chairs or rowboats or walking, and 
I've walked across most of China, central China.

06:14.133 --> 06:18.940
Living in China, of course, is much like living in a 
country as large as the United States. A person who

06:18.960 --> 06:23.928
has lived in New York all his life doesn't know 
anything about the Big Bend industry. He wouldn't

06:23.948 --> 06:25.991
know how people lived in South Texas. And people 
live in Shanghai all their life, or all the time in

06:26.652 --> 06:33.863
China, have no conception whatsoever of the rest 
of the countries. And that goes people in the north

06:34.484 --> 06:41.755
or south, so you get many conflicting impressions 
of the country. After you came back from China then

06:41.975 --> 06:52.611
and things erupted in China and you were in the 
United States, presumably you were then without a

06:41.975 --> 06:52.611
job back in China. Yes, I came back to the United 
States and was here for a year. My company finally

06:58.020 --> 07:01.605
decided they couldn't send me back. But in case I 
would go back, they asked me if there was anything I

07:02.311 --> 07:06.917
wanted to do. And I told them I wanted to take a 
training course in motor rebuilding at the Ford

07:06.937 --> 07:13.005
Motor Company. And they arranged that. I went out 
to Ford Motor Company in Detroit and spent two

07:14.427 --> 07:31.069
months rebuilding automobile engines so that I 
could get the equipment to establish in China to

07:14.427 --> 07:31.069
service the motors we had already sold. And I also 
had about 80% of all the tire sales in China,

07:32.078 --> 07:48.458
central China, because I knew the name and make and 
owner of every car in there, because it was a

07:32.078 --> 07:48.458
limited area where you could drive a car. And 
outside of the foreign community, you couldn't.

07:53.004 --> 07:59.352
And so I went to Goodyear for, I don't know, six 
months, I guess. I learned how to build tires and

08:00.277 --> 08:06.063
rebuild them and repair them. They put me on the 
export desk for Central America and I stayed there

08:06.103 --> 08:28.107
for the rest of that part of that year.

08:28.407 --> 08:39.078
picked a man who had never been out of the United 
States to send him to China to take the place of my

08:28.407 --> 08:39.078
favorite district manager in the company in 
China. And so I quit there. And I then

08:46.445 --> 08:55.714
took a job with

08:58.394 --> 09:08.689
an oil company, HH Oil Company, in

08:58.394 --> 09:08.689
West Texas in Big Spring. And I worked as a 
roughneck for six

09:10.052 --> 09:20.527
months until I nearly got killed and I quit. And I 
went back to the company in New York, and we finally

09:20.547 --> 09:27.658
decided I wasn't going back to China. And I met an 
executive of this associated oil company who had a

09:28.583 --> 09:37.173
refinery in Patterson, New Jersey. So with my 
experience in that, I went down there and they put

09:38.215 --> 09:52.532
me through a course of combining fuel oils, 
lubricating oils, and I stayed there for a few

09:38.215 --> 09:52.532
weeks. I accidentally walked into the Texaco 
office, Foreign Department, and

09:53.930 --> 10:03.164
told them who it was. And I wanted to find out where 
J.C. Williams was, the person I knew in China who

10:03.184 --> 10:10.255
lived with me. And he told me. And in the course of 
it, he asked me if I wanted to go back to China. And I

10:16.945 --> 10:18.387
told him I did someday. And I gave him my name and 
address. I was staying at the Times Square Hotel.

10:26.682 --> 10:32.028
The next morning at eight o'clock, he called me up 
and asked me if I'd come down to the office. He

10:32.048 --> 10:33.070
wanted to talk to me. And he laid before me this 
request from the Shanghai District Office that

10:33.891 --> 10:39.938
they'd like to have me back out there. And this was 
two weeks before Christmas.

10:48.828 --> 10:50.110
We talked it over. He said, well, while your thing 
is over, would you mind finding out something

10:51.524 --> 10:57.235
about our products? Well, I said, I know about your 
products. Your man lived with me for four years.

11:00.922 --> 11:04.669
And I've been using it on motor cars in China. And I 
said, it's almost as good as standard oil

11:04.689 --> 11:08.576
products. And he left. So he sent me over to Long 
Island City for weeks training on their oils. And,

11:16.060 --> 11:26.692
of course, my experience as a roughneck in the oil 
field and also with Union Associated Oil, they

11:16.060 --> 11:26.692
thought it would be a good idea if I took this job to 
go out to China. So I told him I would like to go in

11:26.712 --> 11:32.939
January. Well, he said, we have a boat leaving the 
6th of January from Seattle. And I said, well, I

11:39.226 --> 11:45.072
have to get back to Texas and get things 
straightened up because then there's a week

11:39.226 --> 11:45.072
before Christmas. before I, January 6th would be 
too early. And he immediately said that, well, if I

11:50.374 --> 12:00.484
was working for a hard-boiled outfit, and that 
they wasn't accustomed to giving two weeks

11:50.374 --> 12:00.484
vacation to somebody before they hired them. And

12:01.546 --> 12:14.299
he said, I see there's a boat on the 21st of January, 
and if you don't own the whole damn state of Texas,

12:01.546 --> 12:14.299
you ought to be able to get ready at that time. So I 
came back home and packed and went back to China

12:15.983 --> 12:24.112
with the Texas Company. And of course I knew the 
territory and I knew the Chinese and knew the

12:26.014 --> 12:34.563
companies and knew all the hooks and crooks of 
dealing with the Chinese. Everything was fine

12:35.744 --> 12:45.214
until my district manager made a big blunder. ship 
load of kerosene up through the Yangtze Gorges at

12:45.312 --> 12:55.061
the time when the price was highest. The rate's 
always higher in wintertime when the water's low.

13:00.146 --> 13:12.518
And I was opposed to it, but he shipped it anyhow 
because he had a friend in the English community

13:00.146 --> 13:12.518
who he was toady into because he was so excellent at 
the country club. And they shipped it up there, and

13:13.915 --> 13:21.547
it lay out in the harbor for 10 days in the rain on a 
flat boat. And we paid the taxes on it, the internal

13:21.567 --> 13:25.433
taxes. And when the general in charge of the area 
came down, we couldn't produce tax sheets. The

13:30.742 --> 13:41.138
Englishmen in charge of shipping it on an English 
boat up through the gorges couldn't be found, and

13:30.742 --> 13:41.138
they taxed us again on it. And we lost—had all these 
cases exposed to rain, and they began to rust and to

13:41.894 --> 13:46.521
leak. And we got it up to Chongqing a week or two 
later. They had 800 gallons lost, and the Chinese

13:52.510 --> 14:07.513
came and dipped it up with tin cans and what have you 
out of the ship and located it on the foreshore

13:52.510 --> 14:07.513
where they had not any place to store it except in a 
Chinese hut. and there was kerosene leaking all

14:08.270 --> 14:11.995
over the place, one that didn't all catch fire. 
Well, they sent me up there to straighten that out,

14:13.036 --> 14:37.770
and they also sent up an interpreter who was a 
professional detective who had worked for

14:13.036 --> 14:37.770
Standard Oil for many years, and he had the record 
of this, and he double-crossed me because I

14:13.036 --> 14:37.770
couldn't speak the Sichuanese language, and he 
took a fifth of one-tenth or one-tenth of a percent

14:13.036 --> 14:37.770
off of Comshaw for each case, and we finally found a 
place outside of the city limits of what we'd call

14:38.493 --> 14:46.762
the harbor limits there. A Chinese house was 
roofed in with bamboo, and you could put 30,000

14:47.623 --> 15:03.100
cases in there, and we did, and then they had to hire 
men to look after it. And the reason I took it,

15:03.620 --> 15:11.650
because it was the only place available, and it was 
right in the middle of the thieves' union

15:03.620 --> 15:11.650
territory. You have unions of thieves in China, 
and you have to play with the thieves, not the

15:11.671 --> 15:16.697
police. Because when the thieves steal anything, 
they know who got it. And if they don't, somebody

15:20.502 --> 15:25.088
gets the throat

15:20.502 --> 15:25.088
cut. When it was found out, of course, and reported 
to New York, and they got wind of it, I put their

15:26.215 --> 15:35.245
cargo in the center of a thieves outfit. And I was 
paying the thieves $50 a month just to look after

15:35.445 --> 15:40.671
it. And the thieves, of course, were not going to 
let anybody else steal it. And they were

15:45.597 --> 15:47.019
satisfied. They'd get more money that way than 
they was getting any other way, illegitimately.

15:51.744 --> 15:55.328
And this was perfectly safe.

15:56.202 --> 16:04.535
The company sent another detective up there, 
their own up there, and they found this fellow

15:56.202 --> 16:04.535
chiseling for $7,000. And so we had a big racket, 
and the interpreter disappeared, and I never have

16:05.717 --> 16:14.792
known what happened to him. I took him as 
interpreter to see one of the Tuchans across the

16:16.234 --> 16:21.923
river, and it turned out that This Tuchin had a 
reward out for his head, because he had stole one of

16:22.578 --> 16:27.684
these concubines. And we went in, and he 
interpreted our discourses and made an agreement

16:28.585 --> 16:36.674
as to the treatment of our men down on the 
waterfront. And I didn't find this out till after

16:37.434 --> 16:40.818
he came back. And he disappeared. The general

16:43.301 --> 16:52.551
in charge of ,, his men picked him up and beheaded 
him. I assume they did. I never found out what

16:53.811 --> 16:55.694
happened. So I came back downriver and

16:55.714 --> 17:02.404
had a long story of horror to tell them. And so they 
said, well, you better get back down to Shanghai

17:03.146 --> 17:07.292
district. And when I went to Shanghai, the first 
thing that told me he wanted me to go to Korea. And I

17:13.101 --> 17:17.468
went to Korea for six or eight months. I came back to 
Shanghai, and that time the Depression hit. was

17:22.973 --> 17:24.915
still reflecting on us out there. They came back, 
and eight or 10 of the people who had been with them

17:26.016 --> 17:38.711
for 25 years were cashiered because they couldn't 
keep them any longer, and all of their hard plans

17:26.016 --> 17:38.711
had been messed up. And so they said that they'd 
have to cancel my contract. And so that was

17:47.180 --> 17:52.947
satisfying to me because things were getting 
pretty rough.

17:55.188 --> 18:11.245
though I took my money and got on a boat and went 
around the world, stayed a few weeks, months in

17:55.188 --> 18:11.245
India and Egypt and France and Germany and 
England. And when I landed back in New York with red

18:12.567 --> 18:23.659
lines a mile long, a very depressing time, I got all 
my junk back to Texas. and then went back to the

18:24.348 --> 18:31.316
University of Pennsylvania and just got on a 
streetcar and drove out there and enrolled. And I

18:31.916 --> 18:47.453
stayed there until 1937 when

18:31.916 --> 18:47.453
I accidentally came down here and

18:31.916 --> 18:47.453
contacted these people at Tech. Two years later, I 
came down here. Did you teach at University of

18:49.876 --> 18:51.638
Pennsylvania then? No, I was a graduate student 
there. I took the business administration

18:54.031 --> 18:57.835
course, then I took the doctoral course. And I was 
writing my thesis between 36 and 39. And when the

19:01.700 --> 19:16.797
war started, the Japanese oriental division of 
the Library of Congress double-crossed me out of

19:01.700 --> 19:16.797
all of my documented references. And so I knew I 
couldn't finish it. So then I gave up. Meantime, I

19:20.221 --> 19:21.523
got married. And so we landed in here in 1940. I did 
Texas Tech. And I stayed there until I retired in

19:28.585 --> 19:31.188
62. OK. So that's how come you were, the business 
course you took was what made you teach economics

19:32.370 --> 19:42.584
and management rather than horticulture, which 
was your undergraduate major. Yes. See, I'd been

19:42.724 --> 19:48.692
so far away from agriculture for those years 
because I'd been in shipping and international

19:42.724 --> 19:48.692
trade. International relations. So I majored in 
international economics at the university. And

19:53.956 --> 19:55.438
then did you ever finish your doctorate? No. No. My 
first son was my doctorate. I didn't expect him so

19:59.862 --> 20:02.285
soon. And arriving down here, then the war 
destroyed all of the pertinence of my four years

20:02.305 --> 20:11.375
accumulation of information. I had to run for 
three years at the Department of Commerce,

20:12.055 --> 20:15.359
Department of State. I was in both those. I knew 
everybody in there in those days. It was very

20:19.013 --> 20:19.854
simple. Of course, you couldn't get in there 
without an armed guard now, but I knew everybody in

20:20.054 --> 20:25.980
there in those days. And so then you were at Texas 
Tech in the economics department from, what, 40?

20:32.006 --> 20:33.147
40 to 62. And of course, in 42, they made me head of 
department. And I stayed head of department until

20:39.994 --> 20:44.339
I retired from that in 65. And of course, remained 
there the next three years. Made it 22 years in all

20:49.557 --> 20:52.702
when I retired in 62. What have you been doing since 
you retired? Well, unfortunately, my wife

20:56.188 --> 21:04.663
developed Parkinson's disease, and that limited 
our activities. We visited with relatives in

21:05.268 --> 21:09.573
various places in Texas. I mean, Fort Worth 
primarily. But as she grew worse, she required

21:11.675 --> 21:16.420
more of my attention. And I became her sole nurse 
for the next 10 years. And she died June a year ago.

21:24.228 --> 21:30.195
And I've spent all my time the last four years as a 
nurse around the clock. And I've only been out of

21:31.416 --> 21:35.140
town once in four years. Week before last, I went up 
to Wisconsin to visit my son, who's with General

21:35.845 --> 21:42.591
Motors up there, and I had a week with him. It's the 
only time I've had one night out of my house in

21:43.512 --> 21:49.858
nearly five years. Okay. Albert Atkinson was a CE 
student enlisted in this 32nd Service Company

21:51.880 --> 22:05.312
with me, and he was what we call a photographer buff 
today. And when these airplanes, one of them

22:06.305 --> 22:11.913
landed there, I think it was out of Houston or 
someplace down there. This was on campus? On

22:12.895 --> 22:13.796
campus. He had talked this fellow into taking him 
up and let him take pictures. And he took pictures

22:18.162 --> 22:20.025
of the campus. And I have three or four of them he 
gave me. And

22:24.351 --> 22:34.506
I would suggest that if you could see him in Dallas, 
and he's in the student directory there. Albert

22:34.655 --> 22:36.998
Atkinson, 29. I think he must have had a son or two 
because there's two more Atkinsons down there.

22:41.743 --> 22:43.405
But he's CE 1920. Actually, I think he was, well, I 
think that was it. No, he was class of 19, I think.

22:51.694 --> 22:54.517
But I'd just love to see him. I haven't seen him 
since I left college. He was the same man who took

22:57.360 --> 23:02.265
the picture of the University of Texas steer that 
was branded. I think that's right, and I have a

23:02.380 --> 23:05.284
picture of that, too. That occurred while you were 
a student, did it not? Yes, that was one of the big

23:08.588 --> 23:11.712
episodes. We've had a good bit of interest in that 
just recently, my assistant and I have. As a matter

23:16.538 --> 23:21.284
of fact, he went down to McAllen and interviewed 
Hans Rohde, who did the branding. Hans Rohde did

23:21.444 --> 23:23.486
the branding. Got a good story from him about the 
branding. I like to read that sometimes, it's a

23:26.330 --> 23:28.793
memory. Rodie also sent us in the mail an 
invitation to a barbecue that he thought occurred

23:29.752 --> 23:54.814
in 22 but I believe it was actually 1920 and this 
would have been during your senior year that

23:29.752 --> 23:54.814
apparently with this 13 to nothing brand on the 
side of the animal some people have said they the

23:29.752 --> 23:54.814
University of Texas over branded it to read Bevo 
and we can't find any proof of that. Some people

23:57.799 --> 24:01.384
have said the animal never made another public 
appearance. It never made another public

24:01.404 --> 24:04.167
appearance as far as I know. You see, I left the 
country after that, but from the impression I got

24:04.187 --> 24:11.397
when I got back there, I got back and talked to some 
people. I understood that they disposed of that

24:11.497 --> 24:13.559
animal. Well, Rhodey sent us an invitation to a 
banquet in Austin in 1920. which supposedly they

24:18.942 --> 24:47.363
had killed this animal and had a barbecue over in 
austin and they invited people from a m and people

24:18.942 --> 24:47.363
from university of texas to it and supposedly uh 
according to a newspaper clipping we have they

24:18.942 --> 24:47.363
split to hide one school got one half and the other 
school got the other half i don't know who got the

24:18.942 --> 24:47.363
branded half we've never been able to track that 
down oh that was big days and exciting that's one of

24:18.942 --> 24:47.363
the most exciting things that ever happened i've 
been looking back on it That was really something.

24:49.176 --> 24:50.457
The school went wild. Well, there was another one 
afterwards. Or was it before? We went down to

24:55.442 --> 25:00.366
Houston and beat the Owls. And I think it was the 
first time we'd beat them in years. And they had a

25:03.189 --> 25:04.350
mascot. It was a big

25:04.390 --> 25:09.134
stuffed owl. And a group of students swiped it and 
ran down the street with it and put it on the train

25:09.335 --> 25:17.282
and expressed it at a college station. And the Rice 
student body tried to come down and recover it, and

25:17.988 --> 25:24.297
the express company wouldn't release it, of 
course. And they brought that back. And we had an

25:26.199 --> 25:32.728
armory up on the third floor of the administration 
in the northeast corner, and they stored it in

25:26.199 --> 25:32.728
there. And some Rice students came up there, and 
they stayed on the campus as visitors for three or

25:34.531 --> 25:42.081
four days. And they finally found out where that 
was, where it was hidden. So one night, they went up

25:47.772 --> 25:54.722
there with crowbars and broke that open and got the 
thing down those three flights, staring into a

25:47.772 --> 25:54.722
car. And it had no better sense than to parade 
around the campus yelling, we got the owl. And so

26:00.250 --> 26:04.937
they started off those dirt roads all the way down 
to Houston then, you see. And so it happened just 3

26:04.977 --> 26:09.223
o'clock in the morning. The whole student body, 
nice shirts and everything else. They got on a

26:12.189 --> 26:18.177
train to beat it down to Navasota to head it off. And 
some went in cars that they could scramble to get

26:18.397 --> 26:22.924
the very many cars around. But they finally got a 
bridge over a creek down there. They got there

26:26.689 --> 26:35.201
before this car and the Bryce group went off in the 
woods and burned it up rather than have it

26:26.689 --> 26:35.201
captured. That was pretty exciting. But they 
brought those people back, kept them on the campus

26:37.047 --> 26:41.713
as prisoners for three or four days. It was all good 
natured stuff, but it was lots of excitement.

26:46.059 --> 26:47.782
Yeah, that was a pretty good story. That sort of 
stuff really can't go on anymore, I don't think.

26:52.067 --> 26:56.574
They've pilfered a few things over the last two 
years, but not anything like that. Oh, a couple

26:56.674 --> 26:59.518
years ago, they stole the university steer again. 
They did. Brought it over to campus and braided it

27:00.499 --> 27:04.945
around for a while, and then they took it back, or 
allowed it to go back. There's something happened

27:08.986 --> 27:14.374
to the spirit of students out at Tech, even in the 
faculty. For the years I was there, our faculty was

27:15.395 --> 27:23.608
closely associated, especially in the Division 
of Business Administration. We were all closely

27:25.090 --> 27:26.992
associated. Of course, we were on two floors. And 
we had meetings with each other all the time. And

27:32.017 --> 27:36.862
we'd have social meetings, three formal ones 
through the year. And the students

27:37.763 --> 27:43.849
seemed to be closer together. And there wasn't any 
friction. But now I'm told I haven't been on the

27:49.215 --> 27:54.540
campus much since I retired because I As they say, I 
had to stay at home. And when the cars got so

27:57.159 --> 28:05.487
numerous that it was difficult to park, and after I 
hurt my feet, I couldn't. It was too uncomfortable

28:05.587 --> 28:07.729
to walk up there. And then they finally put the 
administration over in the new high rise

28:07.829 --> 28:12.013
building. And they're all on different floors. 
And they don't see each other once a year. And they

28:16.517 --> 28:23.683
don't even know the names of the new people that 
know the people who come in. Across the campus,

28:24.254 --> 28:26.737
there's so many new people come in. The faculty's 
tripled in numbers. And people don't know each

28:29.241 --> 28:33.066
other except in their own division. And when I said 
to someone here recently, who is this new man you

28:33.086 --> 28:37.632
got in economics? He said, I haven't met him. I 
don't know. So you have that spirit. They don't

28:42.238 --> 28:45.001
have parties anymore, social activities. I think 
this is true at many, many schools. We used to have a

28:49.752 --> 28:53.517
little place down there where the agriculture 
building is. Now there's a little tree, some

28:53.597 --> 28:57.443
forest there, a few trees. And we'd have faculty 
picnics down there. And then we used the old, what

29:01.869 --> 29:11.683
do you call it, the auditorium or the place where 
the judge am. We used to have parties in there two or

29:12.424 --> 29:16.470
three times a year, the whole faculty. And of 
course, you could get the whole faculty in one room

29:16.490 --> 29:19.354
then. There was room 225 that would hold 100. We'd 
get everybody in there. Today, they haven't got a

29:23.877 --> 29:25.262
building. They're big enough to take care of 
things, let alone the students.
