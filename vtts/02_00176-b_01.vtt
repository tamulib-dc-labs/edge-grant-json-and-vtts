WEBVTT

00:03.558 --> 00:11.409
in January of 1970, and Mr. Rutter's illness and death comes that spring.

00:11.709 --> 00:22.584
Actually, he must have taken ill in late January, early February, and he was sick for a while, maybe died in March.

00:22.644 --> 00:24.487
Does that sound right?

00:25.568 --> 00:26.209
I think that's right.

00:26.249 --> 00:28.973
The only time I ever saw President Johnson, he was at the funeral.

00:29.834 --> 00:33.379
Oh, I remember how Johnson and Shivers

00:33.578 --> 00:36.742
a whole bunch of John Connelly were all there.

00:38.044 --> 00:44.853
When you became dean, did you have any specific goals in mind for the college?

00:47.877 --> 00:48.237
Yes.

00:49.238 --> 00:56.828
With respect to the research programs, I wanted to see these greatly expanded and the quality improved.

00:57.930 --> 01:00.413
I think that our teaching had been

01:01.034 --> 01:07.662
in general good through the years, but the research function of the college had lagged, and so I tended to push pretty hard on that.

01:07.682 --> 01:18.675
In fact, some people misunderstood, I think, and I was given the reputation of not caring about teaching on the research, which definitely wasn't true.

01:18.755 --> 01:25.523
My feeling is that the first thing you do is take care of your teaching responsibilities and do it right.

01:26.330 --> 01:32.779
But then you also owe other service and any scientist should owe other service in terms of research.

01:34.301 --> 01:39.128
So that was my main goal was to improve that function.

01:40.030 --> 01:45.958
We also of course needed some space and equipment which was always a nagging problem

01:46.613 --> 01:55.627
And when I remember that we ran freshman chemistry laboratories from either 7 or 8 a.m.

01:55.687 --> 01:59.252
till 11 p.m., five days a week.

01:59.272 --> 02:09.448
And one day, Dr. Williams was visiting, and I took him by the old chemistry building in the first floor basement there, that huge freshman laboratory, and it was just amazing.

02:10.458 --> 02:23.414
overpowering, the crowded conditions, the drabness of it all, and he was shocked, and it was shortly thereafter, I mean very shortly thereafter that we got permission to plan the Heldenfelds building.

02:25.038 --> 02:26.121
When you took over,

02:27.535 --> 02:35.927
which departments or programs did you think were the leaders in the College of Science?

02:35.987 --> 02:37.149
Oh, chemistry by far.

02:38.170 --> 02:47.224
And somebody made a decision some years before you... Brought in Arthur Martell and... How did that come about?

02:47.244 --> 02:52.732
I don't know because I wasn't involved, but Arthur Martell knew a lot.

02:52.812 --> 02:57.238
He was, in the first place, an eminent researcher, very prominent.

02:57.623 --> 03:02.750
and inorganic chemistry, and he knew how things were done other places.

03:02.811 --> 03:05.915
He knew how to get a program development grant, for example.

03:05.935 --> 03:12.965
That's one of the first things he set about doing, get a program development grant from the NSF, which gives you enormous flexibility.

03:13.827 --> 03:20.897
And you can juggle teaching loads, research loads, equipment, all sorts of things.

03:20.937 --> 03:22.399
He did that very skillfully.

03:22.700 --> 03:26.365
So chemistry was way in front, there's no question about it.

03:28.628 --> 03:37.139
Physics was doing well, not as well as chemistry, but it was progressing.

03:38.561 --> 03:52.420
Mathematics, mathematicians and their organization are completely foreign to me, and I was just glad that

03:52.737 --> 03:56.021
Dr. Byers had hired Bob Blakely before I became dean.

03:56.482 --> 04:05.995
I'm just glad Bob speaks eloquent English and thinks in terms like non-mathematicians, and so that made it simpler.

04:06.035 --> 04:08.498
But I can't tell you how math was doing.

04:08.698 --> 04:15.387
They improved dramatically during that time because we, for example, phased out all these instructorships, got in people,

04:15.367 --> 04:19.652
with terminal degrees in mathematics and people who were going to do research.

04:19.873 --> 04:22.175
Now we did have some problems with the teaching there.

04:22.215 --> 04:36.413
There's no question about it because it's a difficult subject and some people were not very diligent about their teaching and we had to make some changes there.

04:36.916 --> 05:01.523
biology was a real problem biology was controlled by the classical biologists who stubbornly failed to recognize that there's a new biology on the loose and it was very difficult as a matter of fact i never did get i'm never did get uh... things settled in biology the way i wanted to uh... tried

05:01.975 --> 05:05.880
with tremendous effort, and Herbert Roller was a great help in trying this.

05:11.166 --> 05:15.871
The inertia was just too much to overcome.

05:15.891 --> 05:18.775
So, let's see, departments, biology, chemistry, physics.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.417
Mathematics, statistics.

05:20.677 --> 05:21.398
And statistics.

05:21.598 --> 05:23.981
And the Cyclotron Institute was later added.

05:24.001 --> 05:31.830
I mean, it had been under Vice President Subtle at the time when Dr. Williams came and made his

05:32.772 --> 05:35.800
decision to change the organization.

05:35.860 --> 05:43.699
That affected this, and did you go off?

05:44.742 --> 05:47.529
That's the background on that.

05:47.549 --> 05:49.313
But we were talking about the

05:50.710 --> 06:11.082
departments in the College of Science, include the cyclotron, and when it came back into the College of Science in, I think, 1971, probably, early 71, I don't remember, maybe the summer of 71, Tom Sugihara became director and did a masterful job of pulling together a proposal that got us funded for multiple years on the National Science Foundation.

06:11.872 --> 06:17.941
All right, then as Dr. Williams becomes president, what was your early impression of him?

06:18.221 --> 06:18.802
Very favorable.

06:20.485 --> 06:28.076
Did he have any key early conversations with deans that you remember?

06:29.098 --> 06:32.402
How did he become aware of what the College of Science was all about?

06:34.245 --> 06:37.730
Well, basically, Dr. Williams worked through vice presidents.

06:37.750 --> 06:40.174
He didn't work directly with deans to any great extent.

06:40.492 --> 06:45.358
But one time I just invited him, come spend a day at the College of Science.

06:45.378 --> 06:46.399
We'll go different places.

06:46.479 --> 06:47.220
I'll show you different things.

06:47.300 --> 06:47.901
Sure, we'll do it.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.623
And he gave me a date and did.

06:50.304 --> 06:53.608
And then we had a dinner out at Briarcrest that night.

06:54.089 --> 06:58.714
And I felt bad because it was something like the 39th consecutive evening that he had been away from home.

06:58.755 --> 07:00.537
And I'm sorry, Dr. Wang.

07:00.557 --> 07:01.698
I said, don't worry about it, Mike.

07:02.699 --> 07:04.742
That's life.

07:05.383 --> 07:09.688
But I always felt that I could talk with him any time I wanted to.

07:10.529 --> 07:15.835
He never showed the slightest irritation toward me.

07:16.516 --> 07:17.957
Did you ever see him lose his cool?

07:19.319 --> 07:21.261
Yes, but never toward me.

07:21.661 --> 07:24.845
Can you share an example of it?

07:24.865 --> 07:38.680
One time, we had recruited a very senior scientist, and so I went over there and said, Dr. Williams, can we earmark some organized research funds for this guy for the next

07:39.166 --> 07:41.990
three years or five years wanted to get him settled here.

07:42.991 --> 07:49.920
He said, now, Mac, if we got people coming here demanding this kind of stuff, we're just not going to, they can just stay away.

07:49.940 --> 07:52.023
I said, hold it, let me go out and come in again.

07:52.884 --> 07:53.585
He didn't ask that.

07:53.705 --> 07:54.987
I'm just asking if you'll do it.

07:56.929 --> 07:59.132
No, he didn't, but he wasn't mad at me.

07:59.517 --> 08:12.639
We were in the MSC, not the MSC, the rudder tower, right after it was finished, and the fireman had been there, and somebody had pulled a heavy piece of equipment across the parquet floor and plowed a trench in it.

08:15.123 --> 08:20.412
I was with him, and he exploded and called them Marine Corps names.

08:23.412 --> 08:24.556
You mentioned Marine Corps.

08:25.279 --> 08:31.822
I learned that he had a very, very exemplary record, wartime record in the Marine Corps.

08:32.404 --> 08:34.873
I never heard him brag about it.

08:35.512 --> 08:37.415
No, he was very low-key.

08:37.915 --> 08:42.762
He was a company commander, I think, of a heavy weapons company, at least by the end of the war.

08:42.782 --> 08:47.489
Wounded, decorated, all that, but I never... Never said much about that.

08:47.850 --> 09:03.612
One thing I remember, for some reason I was in office, and there's something about Lieutenant Calley, the My Lai massacre, and he said, there's no way on earth I would obey an order to mow down civilians.

09:03.895 --> 09:10.787
Now, Dr. Byers was the chief academic officer when Dr. Williams came.

09:11.347 --> 09:13.070
Then he retires?

09:13.792 --> 09:14.913
In 71.

09:15.675 --> 09:18.880
Summer of 71, he went back to his professorship.

09:18.900 --> 09:19.100
All right.

09:19.121 --> 09:23.828
How did Dr. Williams identify the next vice president of academic affairs?

09:23.868 --> 09:24.790
Don't know.

09:25.546 --> 09:30.052
I think I'm quite sure that he and John knew each other previously.

09:30.372 --> 09:30.973
I think so.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.215
And at least had met.

09:33.796 --> 09:42.587
I remember John told me that he was at some meeting where Jack was there, and Jack said, I just wanted to meet somebody named John C. Calhoun.

09:43.007 --> 09:43.748
Because of Clemson.

09:43.768 --> 09:46.031
Yeah, he came around and shook hands with him.

09:46.051 --> 09:47.933
So at least he knew of him.

09:50.497 --> 09:54.962
But I do remember he called, at least me, I don't know about the other things, he called me in and said,

09:55.212 --> 10:02.406
I'm planning on appointing John Calhoun to Vice President of Academic Affairs.

10:02.486 --> 10:04.129
By the way, there's a change in title.

10:04.650 --> 10:07.295
Wayne and Horace both used Academic Vice President.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.017
Yes, that's right.

10:08.037 --> 10:11.623
And then John changed it to Vice President for Academic Affairs.

10:12.064 --> 10:14.970
But he said, I'm considering appointing John to that position.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.613
Do you have any problem with it?

10:16.593 --> 10:20.078
And I said, no, I have none.

10:20.178 --> 10:29.371
And he said, in a way, it's been a little bit unfair to the rest of your deans because John is dean of geosciences, but he's also a vice chancellor.

10:30.292 --> 10:36.060
And so, and he said, in that sense, it's been a little bit unfair to the rest of your deans.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.024
But I said, I have no problem at all.

10:39.886 --> 10:45.233
And by the way, I'll add here, I think John Calhoun has been underappreciated.

10:46.124 --> 11:06.925
I agree entirely because of the immense role that I think he played in helping to move this place forward academically, and under that I mean both teaching and research, and has one of the most creative minds still going strong that I've ever been around.

11:07.185 --> 11:09.147
We got along great.

11:09.308 --> 11:11.710
You know, John never took me to task for anything.

11:11.943 --> 11:16.908
But we laughed that we made an agreement that we would not get mad at the same time.

11:20.111 --> 11:28.179
All right, as he becomes vice president, describe his manner of beginning work with the dean.

11:32.623 --> 11:34.125
He was very easy to see.

11:34.165 --> 11:37.528
Anytime I wanted to see him, there was no problem.

11:38.116 --> 11:41.201
I could argue his decisions and it would not be held against me.

11:41.301 --> 11:49.333
And most important, the next time I came, if I had won the debate the previous time, he didn't hold it against me when I walked in the door.

11:50.134 --> 11:51.276
It was fresh start.

11:52.097 --> 11:54.962
The facts are here, now we'll make this decision.

11:55.543 --> 11:59.128
So he was, I found him easy to work, he was

11:59.834 --> 12:06.192
always willing to listen, and I learned that from him, and I tried to do it when I was vice president.

12:06.213 --> 12:14.316
In fact, see if you agree with this, I believe that he would have held it to someone's discredit if they later had

12:14.768 --> 12:20.557
had said to him honestly, I would have told you, but I was afraid you didn't want me to say it.

12:20.777 --> 12:25.605
Oh, that would really infuriate him.

12:25.625 --> 12:26.266
Oh, no, he wouldn't.

12:27.628 --> 12:32.856
An example, let me put this on tape, an example I give of my own failure.

12:32.876 --> 12:35.600
I'd been over with him only about a month and a half.

12:35.720 --> 12:40.067
We went to a meeting of the library committee, which I had chaired for a good while.

12:40.553 --> 12:44.598
And these were the plans for that first big expansion of the Cushing Library.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.302
They asked him some very detailed questions.

12:49.203 --> 12:54.109
No way he could have known because he hadn't had a chance to look through all of the last pages.

12:54.829 --> 13:04.360
Then they asked me the same questions, and I contradicted the answers he had given because I knew what was in those details.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.563
And I saw the look on his face.

13:06.943 --> 13:10.307
When the meeting was over, as we walked out, he didn't say anything to me.

13:11.097 --> 13:17.968
When we got out of earshot of everybody, I turned to him and I said, Dr. Calhoun, I want to apologize first of all.

13:19.470 --> 13:34.033
Second of all, I want to say to you, if I have a chance to continue, I will demonstrate to you that I will never do that again in a public setting.

13:34.435 --> 13:38.752
to take a contrary view for me.

13:38.953 --> 13:43.652
He looked me very closely in the eye and he said, see to it that you don't.

13:44.037 --> 13:51.345
Subject ended, never mentioned again ever, and within six or eight steps we're chuckling.

13:51.545 --> 13:54.909
And I thought that was good advice for him.

13:55.629 --> 13:59.974
Am I, is my memory correct?

14:00.034 --> 14:03.438
We had a dean's meeting every week.

14:03.458 --> 14:06.501
Academic Programs Committee Monday at 1 o'clock.

14:06.521 --> 14:07.222
That's what I thought.

14:08.343 --> 14:13.268
And it included the academic deans plus

14:13.552 --> 14:14.673
Was Cooper there?

14:15.274 --> 14:21.640
Yes, because registration always was a matter that we needed to thresh out.

14:21.961 --> 14:25.604
But I can't think of any, the library director was not there.

14:25.845 --> 14:26.065
No.

14:26.585 --> 14:38.537
I got to sit in with my, even before I had the title dean of faculties, and Winnerty was there so that it was the key academic.

14:38.557 --> 14:38.838
Right.

14:41.901 --> 14:43.002
They were good meetings.

14:45.108 --> 14:54.370
I thought those were very, very... I continued that after I took over and then after you left I continued right up until the time I resigned.

14:54.651 --> 15:03.572
Do you remember during those years any decisions which now in hindsight look like very key decisions whether they were positive or negative?

15:08.902 --> 15:10.044
I don't have any in mind.

15:10.765 --> 15:11.426
I don't either.

15:11.867 --> 15:15.994
I'm sure there are some, but it's been a gradual process.

15:17.316 --> 15:21.904
The whole progress has been a gradual process, and I don't remember any specifically.

15:21.984 --> 15:26.792
Do you agree with me that we all, even subconsciously,

15:27.076 --> 15:32.226
were aware that this place was moving, it was growing, it was getting better.

15:32.787 --> 15:33.208
Oh yeah.

15:33.228 --> 15:35.172
But we were part of something that was happening.

15:35.192 --> 15:45.051
One time, shortly after the Texan opened, you know it used to be open for lunch, I was sort of down there, and Dave Brooks, who was in charge of our freshman chemistry program,

15:45.571 --> 15:49.795
And he was in the group, and something sticks in my mind still.

15:50.116 --> 15:57.223
He said, anybody who isn't impressed with the way this university is moving is unconscious or burst that effect.

15:58.084 --> 16:11.758
Of your fellow deans, were there any that you thought had more access to John Calhoun's or Jack Williams' ear than anybody else?

16:12.258 --> 16:13.840
Were there any deans that had more?

16:15.187 --> 16:16.268
I don't think so.

16:17.789 --> 16:23.855
I think that, well, maybe Dave and I did.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.877
I don't know.

16:25.917 --> 16:26.437
What do you think?

16:26.697 --> 16:28.319
No, I didn't think so.

16:28.839 --> 16:32.823
It seemed like everything was just plain fair with him.

16:33.223 --> 16:43.152
I thought in the olden days, before I was there at the table to know whether it was true or not, I'd always heard that engineering and or particularly agriculture

16:43.452 --> 16:45.374
could almost veto anything.

16:46.015 --> 16:47.777
But I did not think that was true.

16:47.837 --> 16:49.038
No, I don't think so.

16:49.138 --> 16:54.724
I think that maybe Pearson did initially because he and John played poker in the same club.

16:54.804 --> 16:58.828
And so, well, and Romanick was in that club.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.551
But I don't think that sloshed over so much.

17:02.592 --> 17:04.875
At least I never felt any disadvantage.

17:05.776 --> 17:12.463
What was, for you as a real working dean, what did you see as the role of Dick Winerdi?

17:16.139 --> 17:17.241
Well, not easy to say.

17:17.301 --> 17:21.927
He took care of a lot of the details of the office there.

17:23.029 --> 17:34.465
He liked to at least give the impression that he was involved in the decision making, and I presume he was.

17:34.986 --> 17:37.489
As I say, he gave that impression, and I presume he was.

17:38.110 --> 17:42.114
I had the impression that Dick loved crises.

17:42.134 --> 17:42.354
Yes.

17:42.455 --> 17:53.726
That he worked best if he could visualize a crisis and impress it on the typing pool and Jeanette and so forth that we have a big crisis we've got to solve.

17:58.051 --> 18:02.415
I was stunned my first day as a full-time member of that staff.

18:03.797 --> 18:06.820
He and I went into Dr. Calhoun's office probably at 5.30.

18:06.840 --> 18:07.881
Everybody else was gone.

18:08.924 --> 18:14.292
And he took issue strongly with something Calhoun had drafted.

18:15.474 --> 18:18.819
And I think he even said, John, you don't know what you're talking about here.

18:19.420 --> 18:20.141
I was stunned.

18:21.363 --> 18:32.080
And then I realized that Calhoun, later, by experience, I realized that Calhoun was very receptive to that kind of sentiment privately

18:33.207 --> 18:34.188
Yeah.

18:34.208 --> 18:36.271
And if you had some basis for it.

18:36.291 --> 18:36.571
Oh, yeah.

18:36.592 --> 18:37.533
You'd better have a reason.

18:37.593 --> 18:37.993
That's right.

18:38.174 --> 18:38.374
Yeah.

18:38.394 --> 18:38.714
That's right.

18:38.734 --> 18:39.495
You'd better have a reason.

18:40.036 --> 18:40.236
All right.

18:40.256 --> 18:44.502
Did you all feel there was a good turnaround time on matters?

18:44.562 --> 18:44.863
Yes.

18:45.343 --> 18:46.164
With Calhoun?

18:46.805 --> 18:47.526
Yeah.

18:47.646 --> 18:47.786
Yeah.

18:47.987 --> 18:48.708
And with Williams?

18:50.310 --> 18:53.334
Yeah.

18:54.095 --> 18:59.502
Was there bored or interference that you recall in those years?

19:00.140 --> 19:02.823
with anything, I don't remember particularly.

19:02.843 --> 19:03.384
By the board?

19:07.209 --> 19:09.291
Not right then, later.

19:09.832 --> 19:24.369
And since there was no system, since Williams and Rudder had for a number of years been the chief academic officer of both, then you didn't have to worry about whether this was a system matter or a campus matter.

19:24.390 --> 19:25.110
Correct, yeah.

19:25.951 --> 19:28.915
And I presume that also saved a lot, not only time, but a lot of money.

19:29.789 --> 19:31.032
Certainly a lot of paper.

19:32.896 --> 19:41.294
I used to think that was not a good system, but in retrospect, I believe it's a lot better than what we have now because it minimized the system functions and work.

19:41.314 --> 19:49.452
Do you remember of any proposal ideas that you had that you sent forward that you wish had gotten approved?

19:52.013 --> 19:54.675
There probably were some, but I can't recall any right now.

19:57.017 --> 20:09.108
Well, can you think of, and I don't have anything in mind, can you think of any missteps that were made in the Rudder Williams years?

20:15.613 --> 20:21.058
Well, in retrospect, it looks so much better than what's going on now.

20:21.325 --> 20:24.111
That I can't think of any.

20:24.151 --> 20:29.362
I thought, you know, I was an administrator at a time when it was really fun to be.

20:29.422 --> 20:31.106
I felt like I was doing something.

20:31.166 --> 20:32.790
I felt like we were going somewhere.

20:32.850 --> 20:40.887
The institution was upward bound qualitatively, not just in numbers, but qualitatively.

20:41.508 --> 20:48.644
The people I worked with were by and large congenial, and it was just a great time to be a dean and a vice president.

20:48.664 --> 20:53.776
And when it quit being fun, Haskell, I quit because research was still fun.

20:54.377 --> 20:57.103
Administration wasn't because of the system.

20:57.522 --> 21:00.786
Now, you kept your, did you keep your lab throughout?

21:00.826 --> 21:01.827
Yes, I did.

21:01.847 --> 21:02.047
Your dean?

21:02.067 --> 21:07.534
Yes, and bless their hearts, Stella Wilkes and Mary Evelyn Bayless saved my career.

21:08.355 --> 21:10.858
All right, and let's talk about them for a second.

21:10.938 --> 21:16.285
When did they join you?

21:16.305 --> 21:20.189
At one time, I had these numbers down, but I'm gonna have to approximate them now.

21:20.249 --> 21:25.656
Stella and I must have worked together for 26 years, and Mary for 20.

21:25.973 --> 21:43.587
I'll tell you what, we can date Stella's time in my lab from when Dr. Ray Richardson became head of Agricultural Analytical Services because Stella said, I'm going to resign here, stay out a year, and I'm going back to work for Dr. Prescott.

21:44.769 --> 21:48.977
And Ray said, I kind of thought maybe something like that was going to happen.

21:49.312 --> 21:57.946
And her husband, Lambert Wilkes, was a faculty member in... Agricultural engineering, very distinguished career in research.

21:58.387 --> 22:04.637
I don't know, he is not probably taught quite so much, but he's been terrific in research.

22:05.318 --> 22:11.067
Three Clemson graduates, he, Luther Byrd, and Tom Cartwright.

22:11.519 --> 22:13.022
Terrific researchers.

22:13.643 --> 22:18.892
But then Mary came after Garland finished his PhD.

22:20.735 --> 22:24.281
She worked for Carl Fokers over there, a very eminent organic chemist.

22:25.343 --> 22:29.730
And she came to my lab after that.

22:30.520 --> 22:36.588
So the two of them and... They're so good at what they did.

22:36.608 --> 22:41.074
I never, you know, we just would take, we just talk in general terms of what we're going to do.

22:41.895 --> 22:44.298
While I was being administrative, they were running my lab.

22:44.318 --> 22:45.219
It was still productive.

22:45.340 --> 22:46.561
I had a place to go home to.

22:46.601 --> 22:50.526
Haskell, if I hadn't had a place to go back to, I don't know what I'd have done.

22:50.546 --> 23:00.139
And through all of those administrative years as dean and as vice president, you didn't get a cent of compensation

23:00.558 --> 23:29.856
salary did you for your research no that's what i thought that no that that was uh it was okay i mean i was i was happy with what they paid labor of luck they did i did have quite a struggle in getting their salaries to where they were where they were up the uh with williams were you aware before his heart attack were you aware of decline in his physical no no i wasn't i wasn't either of course um

23:34.156 --> 23:37.380
When did this happen?

23:37.880 --> 23:38.501
Early 76.

23:38.802 --> 23:40.644
Yeah, that's right, early 76.

23:41.525 --> 23:45.309
Our centennial year, which was going to be the end-all be-all.

23:46.471 --> 23:53.479
And he was in desperate condition for a while, then slowly recovered.

23:53.759 --> 23:54.861
Came back in the summer.

23:55.481 --> 23:56.122
Right, yes.

23:56.322 --> 23:57.784
And then...

23:57.764 --> 24:07.981
The board had decided during that time that the system would be recreated and he would be made Chancellor.

24:10.606 --> 24:15.113
And I don't know exactly how I became aware that that was going to happen.

24:15.494 --> 24:16.836
I can't remember any.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.122
specific announcement or anything.

24:19.223 --> 24:23.027
I guess we read it in the battalion or the Eagle probably would just be my guess.

24:23.308 --> 24:26.812
But incidentally, that's how you used to find out if you were promoted.

24:27.032 --> 24:27.233
Yes.

24:27.533 --> 24:32.639
You know, the Eagle was an afternoon paper in those days and you'd pick up the Eagle after the board met and see if you'd been promoted.

24:32.719 --> 24:33.961
That's right.

24:33.981 --> 24:41.170
All right, I rode with Dr. Calhoun to the board meeting at which

24:42.280 --> 24:45.405
the board was going to decide who the new president was.

24:47.047 --> 24:52.235
I had pretty good reason to believe that Dr. Williams was going to recommend it was Dr. Calhoun.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.459
I think that he did.

24:55.260 --> 25:00.428
And that instead the board selected Dr. Miller.

25:01.770 --> 25:05.335
Were you as a dean aware of what was going to happen?

25:06.357 --> 25:08.100
See, remember you and I were also interviewed.

25:08.761 --> 25:09.081
Yes.

25:11.272 --> 25:12.614
And I don't know who else.

25:13.295 --> 25:14.256
Maybe Lee Smith.

25:14.276 --> 25:19.203
Yes, I think Lee Smith from Southwest Texas, who's one of our PhDs, statistics.

25:19.223 --> 25:27.734
And I figured, really, Jack wrote me and said, send me your curriculum.

25:27.814 --> 25:30.538
He didn't tell me why, but it's pretty obvious why.

25:31.159 --> 25:32.320
I'm sure he did do the same way.

25:32.341 --> 25:35.945
But I figured that mine was more wonder-dressing than anything else.

25:37.107 --> 25:38.629
And I thought that...

25:39.250 --> 25:40.772
I figured John was going to be it.

25:40.973 --> 25:41.453
I did too.

25:41.834 --> 25:49.806
Were you aware of the campaign across the state by the experiment station?

25:49.826 --> 25:52.771
It became clear toward the end.

25:54.473 --> 25:57.778
Then I rode back with Dr. Calhoun after the meeting.

25:57.999 --> 25:59.161
He was just as calm.

25:59.301 --> 26:00.122
Where was the meeting?

26:00.162 --> 26:00.523
I forgot.

26:00.623 --> 26:01.444
It was over in the board.

26:02.555 --> 26:03.456
Oh, it was here on campus.

26:03.476 --> 26:04.738
It wasn't in one of these off campus.

26:05.098 --> 26:09.144
And he was just as calm after the meeting as he was before outwardly.

26:10.385 --> 26:12.548
And he had gone in and resigned.

26:14.951 --> 26:19.357
Well, see, he had just turned down the Nebraska job.

26:19.377 --> 26:21.961
And let me get this.

26:22.842 --> 26:23.443
You mentioned that.

26:23.503 --> 26:25.305
Let me add this so it'll be preserved.

26:26.213 --> 26:33.289
When that one day, when he had that offer before him, after 5 o'clock, he asked me and Winerti what we thought.

26:35.935 --> 26:40.986
And we said, Dr. Calhoun, and we didn't conspire in advance.

26:41.006 --> 26:43.311
Each of us agreed that he ought to take it.

26:44.978 --> 26:59.242
And I threw out the opinion, I think that you're so bright that you sometimes scare the A&M board, that they think you're so brainy that they're intimidated.

26:59.262 --> 27:04.791
And I'm afraid that they will never give you the leadership role that you deserve here.

27:06.053 --> 27:07.375
Well, Nerdy agreed with me.

27:09.262 --> 27:12.427
And, but Dr. Calhoun said, well, but I think I'm gonna stay here.

27:12.507 --> 27:13.148
This is home.

27:13.249 --> 27:14.891
Was this chancellor or president there?

27:15.432 --> 27:16.654
Chancellor's like Missouri.

27:17.035 --> 27:17.936
Chancellor's the local.

27:18.618 --> 27:21.262
I don't think at that time they had yet divided it.

27:21.602 --> 27:21.923
Okay.

27:23.986 --> 27:30.517
And if I'm not mistaken, they then picked Woody Varner, an A&M graduate.

27:30.878 --> 27:35.185
I was thinking that Varner was retiring, and that was the reason for this.

27:36.194 --> 27:37.255
No, that wouldn't be right.

27:37.295 --> 27:39.317
Varna was class of 40 here.

27:41.019 --> 27:44.382
So he's roughly a little older than I am, but not much, a couple years older.

27:44.923 --> 27:48.166
And Calhoun is, what's he, three or four years older than I am.

27:48.967 --> 27:49.587
He's 81.

27:50.028 --> 27:50.969
I'm 78, he's 81.

27:51.049 --> 27:57.135
And they picked Jarvis.

27:59.117 --> 28:05.003
On Monday, Calhoun had already moved out of his office out of the T building.

28:05.506 --> 28:06.908
and Dr. Miller was there.

28:10.252 --> 28:16.560
Tell me about his contact with you for you to become the chief academic officer.

28:20.845 --> 28:32.340
I believe that there's a party over at, I can't remember who, maybe Dudley and Angela Smith's house, a celebration party for this, and I was invited.

28:32.877 --> 28:38.149
went over and Jarvis said, need an academic vice president.

28:38.711 --> 28:42.901
And I said, I'd be glad to give you some names of people I think who'd be considered.

28:44.284 --> 28:46.870
And so that was it.

28:47.238 --> 28:48.720
that night at that party.

28:48.740 --> 28:52.746
And then the next day, Jarvis didn't move into the building for a while.

28:52.766 --> 28:57.373
He stayed for a few days in the old Experiment Station office.

28:57.894 --> 29:02.661
And so Betty came in and said, you've got a call from Dr. Miller and he wants to see you.

29:02.721 --> 29:04.524
And so I went over there.

29:04.544 --> 29:07.589
And then that's when he really began talking with me about it.

29:07.769 --> 29:14.359
I didn't know whether he wanted my recommendations or somebody began talking with me about it.

29:14.862 --> 29:27.043
I gathered that he was essentially, had his mind made up, but he said, I want to talk to Dave, and I don't know, he'd probably talk to you and to Dave.

29:27.824 --> 29:33.434
He told, when he talked to me, he said it was either going to be you, me, or Dave.

29:33.814 --> 29:38.322
Well, that was the impression I had, and at the time I left, I thought, well, it's

29:38.774 --> 29:44.347
Sounds like he may offer me the job, but I won't be a loser in any case if it's one of these two other guys.

29:45.008 --> 29:56.715
In fact, Dave, after I was appointed, Dave came around and said, I feel like I've still got most of the chips in this game, which I thought was really nice of him.

29:58.923 --> 30:03.748
Then I guess he made up his mind, and he asked me, he wanted a briefing by all the different deans.

30:04.169 --> 30:05.510
Do you remember that?

30:05.530 --> 30:08.314
After he moved into Dr. Collins' office, he wanted a briefing by all the different deans.

30:08.914 --> 30:10.416
He asked me to sit on all the briefings.

30:10.456 --> 30:13.359
Well, you know, this is what you call telegraphing your punch.

30:13.980 --> 30:21.649
So, you know, there I'm sitting, and here's Benson coming and presenting the engineering programs, and Pearson presenting the business.

30:21.669 --> 30:27.175
And by the way, that's, John made one of these offers that I'll, you know, if you want somebody in business, I'll resign.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.596
and you appoint somebody else, and Jarvis said, well, I'll think it over.

30:32.138 --> 30:34.520
And that was handled badly.

30:34.560 --> 30:44.653
I think that John Pearson was stabbed in the back by one of his own faculty members who had rapport with one of Jarvis's assistants.

30:44.673 --> 30:45.474
I think that's true.

30:45.494 --> 30:46.435
You on my wavelength?

30:47.055 --> 30:47.496
Yeah, I think so.

30:47.516 --> 30:48.617
I think that's what happened.

30:48.637 --> 30:49.959
I think it was a bad deal.

30:51.120 --> 30:54.985
Anyhow, then I was sitting in on all these briefings,

30:55.673 --> 31:03.332
Did Jarvis try to size up any of your opinions, preconceptions before making the decision?

31:06.680 --> 31:06.961
On what?

31:06.981 --> 31:08.224
Make the decision on what?

31:08.485 --> 31:09.868
Before he selected you.

31:10.186 --> 31:14.151
Did he try to be sure that you agreed with him on this, this, or this?

31:14.171 --> 31:15.133
Not that I recall.

31:15.613 --> 31:16.915
Not that I recall.

31:16.935 --> 31:17.396
I don't think so.

31:17.416 --> 31:19.018
I never heard any allegation of that.

31:19.238 --> 31:31.014
And by the way, Jarvis was also easy to, if you will, I told him when he appointed him, I said, now Jarvis, I can help you only if I tell you what I really think and not what I think you want me to say.

31:31.816 --> 31:32.136
Fine.

31:32.577 --> 31:38.725
As you were identified,

31:38.705 --> 31:43.701
Did Dr. Calhoun contact you in any manner?

31:45.969 --> 31:46.691
I don't remember.

31:46.711 --> 31:51.988
I do remember I called him and urged him to stay on.
