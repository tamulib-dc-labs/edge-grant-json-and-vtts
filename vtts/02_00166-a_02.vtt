WEBVTT

00:04.773 --> 00:09.817
There were three of us in that room and still had about the same furniture.

00:09.857 --> 00:14.722
Somewhere along the line, I picked up what's called a Victrola.

00:14.942 --> 00:27.293
At that time, it was a record player, and it was a little cabinet, and the top would raise up, and the sound went through some way back then.

00:27.313 --> 00:33.598
We hit the top and rebound up, and it was a good little music box,

00:34.895 --> 00:49.936
That year, this was my fifth year now when this happened, that year I was asked to join the Aggieland Eight, which was a dance band that was formed on the campus and had, the band had no authority over it, it was just a bunch that got together.

00:50.517 --> 00:58.388
The previous bunch had graduated and there was one or two that had played the year before and

00:58.874 --> 01:03.741
When they formed this year, for some reason they asked me if I wanted to play with them, and I said, sure.

01:03.781 --> 01:06.886
Maybe it was because I had that Victrola and we could play records on it.

01:07.867 --> 01:16.079
But we would go over to Bryan on Saturdays at the music store and listen to records.

01:17.261 --> 01:28.037
And if we had a record that we liked while we would buy it, then we'd go back to my room and play it, and then each one of us would try to pick out our part, and we learned to play that way.

01:28.709 --> 01:30.558
And then you all played dances?

01:30.638 --> 01:31.764
We played for dances.

01:32.990 --> 01:35.462
I still have somewhere a record of

01:36.337 --> 01:39.461
what we made each night playing for dances.

01:39.521 --> 01:48.273
The teachers would have a dance maybe once a month and different organizations, but we played darn near every weekend somewhere.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.516
Somewhere on the campus?

01:51.458 --> 01:51.998
Or in Bryan?

01:52.018 --> 01:57.926
In the Elks Hall, over the country club, or some little town, the surrounding town.

02:01.231 --> 02:04.335
We made somewhere around three,

02:05.041 --> 02:08.565
to five or six dollars a night playing for about four hours.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.428
Now, for the group or per person?

02:11.448 --> 02:12.029
Per person.

02:12.530 --> 02:14.792
Yeah, per person.

02:14.812 --> 02:17.335
And what instruments were in that eight?

02:18.036 --> 02:31.572
We had a bass horn, a trombone, two saxophones, a trumpet, drums and piano, and a banjo.

02:32.733 --> 02:35.756
Jack Pink was the banjo player, and he was our leader.

02:36.456 --> 02:41.061
Now, I get the impression that you didn't have music for all the things you played.

02:41.561 --> 02:42.182
We did not.

02:44.324 --> 02:48.708
Incidentally, now, the rest of the fellas were pretty good musicians.

02:49.649 --> 02:53.892
The other saxophone player, as well as I recall, we had two saxophones.

02:54.733 --> 02:58.617
As well as I recall, the other saxophone player couldn't read music either, good.

02:58.637 --> 03:02.200
He could read it a little bit, about like I could.

03:02.838 --> 03:09.448
We were able to get along, even as band music, because we'd soon learn how to play it by ear where we could do it all right.

03:09.468 --> 03:13.735
What were some of your favorite tunes from that era that you remember?

03:14.596 --> 03:15.037
Oh, me.

03:17.261 --> 03:29.740
Tin Roof Blues, Way Down Yonder, New Orleans, Who, W-H-O, Who, Sonny,

03:30.884 --> 03:35.168
Oh, there were a bunch of others now.

03:35.248 --> 03:36.249
I can't remember all of them.

03:36.709 --> 03:41.194
And the dances, did they do the Charleston?

03:42.715 --> 03:43.736
It was just beginning.

03:44.637 --> 03:49.121
Well, yes, we were playing it because we got into Houston.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.864
Well, during the Christmas holidays, we went on a tour.

03:52.824 --> 03:57.769
And we played in Kerrville the first night.

03:58.458 --> 04:22.879
We played in San Antonio, we played in Galveston, played in Houston, and in Houston some of the dancers there decided they were going to have a little contest among themselves, and we played some piece which was good for Charleston dancing, and everybody nominated some couple, I forget who it was now, it was a champion Charleston couple.

04:23.213 --> 04:27.700
But it was just becoming in and becoming popular at that time.

04:28.381 --> 04:31.786
Do you happen to remember where in Houston y'all performed?

04:32.888 --> 04:36.493
I don't in Houston, but we played in the Galvez Hotel in Galveston.

04:36.814 --> 04:37.795
Hey, that big time.

04:37.955 --> 04:39.277
Big time.

04:39.317 --> 04:40.940
Big time.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.264
And how did y'all get around?

04:43.364 --> 04:43.965
On the train?

04:44.946 --> 04:49.453
We rode a train from Kerrville to Galveston.

04:49.733 --> 04:52.157
I think we rented a...

04:53.285 --> 04:57.232
car or a taxi to go from College Station to Kerrville.

04:57.493 --> 04:58.955
Okay.

04:58.975 --> 04:59.837
And you didn't move?

04:59.857 --> 05:02.341
That seemed like a long distance to go by car.

05:02.822 --> 05:06.629
You didn't, now you didn't take the piano with you though?

05:06.649 --> 05:08.813
No, we always, they always furnished a piano.

05:09.130 --> 05:12.193
where we were, but we did have to carry the bass horn with us.

05:12.574 --> 05:13.234
And the drums.

05:13.475 --> 05:15.216
And the drums, yeah.

05:15.257 --> 05:17.779
I guess we rode the train most everywhere we went.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.623
So when you said bass a while ago, it was a bass horn, not a string bass.

05:21.643 --> 05:22.464
No, a bass horn.

05:22.805 --> 05:25.147
Yeah, the sousaphone.

05:25.167 --> 05:27.830
The sousaphone was just coming in at that time, too.

05:28.210 --> 05:30.112
And y'all were playing jazz?

05:30.393 --> 05:30.733
Yes.

05:31.554 --> 05:35.458
We had one tune that there was no music for,

05:35.911 --> 05:46.901
It was learned, or one of the previous Aggieland eights picked it up from some band that had been playing in a hotel in Corpus Christi.

05:49.042 --> 05:59.832
Their season was up and the Aggieland came in to take their place, and while there was an overlapping there, this old band taught this piece of music to the Aggieland coming in.

05:59.892 --> 06:05.817
And it was taken from, I think it's called Massenet's Elegy.

06:06.455 --> 06:14.568
And they played that, or changed it to a Foxtot tune, and we learned that, and we played that one.

06:14.588 --> 06:22.320
Now, that was strictly no spots to read on that one, but it was a darn nice dance tune, and everybody loved it.

06:22.553 --> 06:24.195
Did you all have any themes?

06:24.275 --> 06:29.179
Did you open usually with the same and close with the same?

06:29.199 --> 06:29.359
No.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.943
No, except we always closed, I guess, with a good bite of Texas.

06:33.884 --> 06:34.424
Oh, okay.

06:35.545 --> 06:36.806
And what did you all wear?

06:38.028 --> 06:39.289
Just a uniform.

06:40.090 --> 06:41.691
Maybe we wore street clothes.

06:41.731 --> 06:45.214
Now, during the Christmas trip, we wore tuxedos.

06:45.294 --> 06:49.118
And I guess for our regular dances,

06:49.992 --> 06:52.795
particularly some special dance, we had tuxedos.

06:53.676 --> 06:56.698
Did you have a conductor or just the eight of you played together?

06:56.939 --> 07:00.102
The banjo player was our conductor.

07:00.122 --> 07:01.944
And you were called the Aggieland Eight?

07:01.964 --> 07:03.365
Aggieland Eight, uh-huh.

07:03.385 --> 07:07.449
And the band had no, I mean, the band director had no authority over us.

07:07.549 --> 07:10.912
It was just a pickup little organization that got together.

07:11.673 --> 07:19.020
Do you have any idea how many years earlier the first Aggieland Eight was formed?

07:20.654 --> 07:35.074
I know it was there when I got there, and there was one man, Saul Bartlett, who died just recently, a few years ago and lived in San Antonio.

07:35.094 --> 07:37.678
Saul Bartlett was the trombone player.

07:37.738 --> 07:42.985
Dink Hubby was the clarinet player.

07:45.469 --> 07:46.510
Paul Washburn

07:46.979 --> 07:49.042
played cornet or trumpet.

07:51.987 --> 07:56.796
It did not have a banjo at the time, and I don't remember who played the piano.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.702
They did have a bass horn.

08:02.826 --> 08:08.295
Barney Dodd, who was in my class, played bass horn with them.

08:09.203 --> 08:13.089
But I don't remember the rest of them now, but there were eight members of the band at that time.

08:13.749 --> 08:17.375
And so you don't know whether it went back before World War I or not?

08:18.036 --> 08:18.476
My what?

08:18.496 --> 08:21.461
You don't know whether there was an Aggieland 8?

08:21.681 --> 08:23.844
No, I have no idea when it was first formed.

08:24.385 --> 08:27.870
And it continued after you a good while?

08:28.491 --> 08:33.017
As far as I know it did until it was taken over by the band.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.824
And I don't know what year that happened.

08:36.844 --> 08:39.006
Oh, now that, see, that's a splendid one.

08:39.066 --> 08:41.829
We didn't have anything about that group at all.

08:41.849 --> 08:42.090
Oh, really?

08:42.110 --> 08:43.912
And that's really good.

08:44.352 --> 08:56.786
Let's see, do you remember any, when y'all were out playing, do you remember any goof-ups where y'all didn't get there, or the train derailed, or you went there?

08:56.806 --> 08:58.848
No, we didn't miss any engagements.

08:58.988 --> 09:02.312
I remember one night, we were going somewhere, and...

09:03.170 --> 09:06.076
We were in a couple of cars, I guess.

09:06.677 --> 09:13.871
The car I was in, we went over kind of a hump to get to the railroad track, and when we got on top, the darn car stopped.

09:14.993 --> 09:21.766
And there was a train coming, but fortunately it was way down there, and we got out and pushed it off the track in time.

09:21.786 --> 09:23.710
We cleared it in plenty of time.

09:24.263 --> 09:27.688
That was the only close accident that we had that I recall.

09:28.209 --> 09:33.416
Did y'all ever play for any celebrity people in the audience?

09:36.721 --> 09:37.762
Governor?

09:38.663 --> 09:39.505
Not that I recall.

09:39.525 --> 09:40.646
Movie star?

09:40.666 --> 09:41.407
None of the dances.

09:41.688 --> 09:45.733
Of course, the band played for some special occasions.

09:46.414 --> 09:53.865
As a matter of fact, my freshman year, Marshall Foch was coming to Houston.

09:54.284 --> 09:55.946
for some kind of a celebration.

09:57.469 --> 10:08.224
And the day before he was to arrive, as I understand it, whoever was putting this parade on, the local band union struck.

10:08.304 --> 10:09.305
They wanted more money.

10:10.847 --> 10:19.700
And they struck, and whoever was sponsored, they got in touch with the A&M band, wanted to know if they'd send the A&M band down to play for this march for the general.

10:20.401 --> 10:21.102
And we went.

10:22.060 --> 10:41.418
And it rained that night, late in the afternoon, but we played and marched, I don't know what was behind us, but we did march down Main Street to the Rice Hotel and went up to the Rice Hotel and had dinner there at somebody's expense.

10:42.739 --> 10:47.283
And it was the first time in my life I ever had Ropeford cheese in celery.

10:48.104 --> 10:50.346
And I thought that was great.

10:50.731 --> 10:53.735
Now, that was the whole Aggie band, not just the Eight.

10:53.755 --> 10:55.137
Yeah, that was a full band.

10:55.217 --> 10:58.140
I guess it was 95 to 100, something like that.

10:58.521 --> 11:02.025
Did the Aggieland Eight ever play at the Rice Hotel?

11:02.326 --> 11:02.826
Do you remember?

11:05.750 --> 11:07.252
I don't remember that we did.

11:07.292 --> 11:13.920
The only time we were there, well, we played in Sylvan Beach, I guess on that Christmas trip, and then...

11:14.609 --> 11:17.853
We didn't play in the Rice Hotel the night we played there.

11:17.873 --> 11:21.358
I think that was the night before we played to Galveston.

11:21.678 --> 11:23.601
Then from Galveston we went to Sylvan Beach.

11:26.765 --> 11:30.751
Let's see, back to going to class.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.995
Before we get off the band, let me mention one thing.

11:34.536 --> 11:41.044
In Fort Worth, during this Christmas trip, we played for a dance in Fort Worth, and we had an upright piano.

11:42.667 --> 11:43.688
And...

11:43.972 --> 11:48.059
there was two or three in the crowd that had a little bit too much to drink.

11:49.160 --> 11:56.312
Well one of them, some of them, I don't know who it was now, or maybe more than one, but anyhow somebody danced by and had a firecracker.

11:58.054 --> 12:06.448
And just before he got by the band he fired this thing up and he threw it into the piano that had this front of it open.

12:06.728 --> 12:10.975
It was an upright piano and that front was off of it, and the piano player didn't know it.

12:13.486 --> 12:17.613
Well, that firecracker went off, and you can imagine what happened.

12:19.756 --> 12:24.704
It really stopped the music, but everything finally quieted down.

12:24.744 --> 12:29.192
But it was, I'll never forget that as long as I live, that noise that thing made in that piano.

12:30.714 --> 12:35.762
As you recall, what song or songs did you most enjoy that y'all played?

12:36.784 --> 12:38.667
What were your favorites?

12:39.693 --> 12:41.114
I liked this song, Who.

12:41.555 --> 12:46.780
There was a, at that time there was a musical comedy in New York City playing, called Sonny.

12:47.760 --> 12:55.087
And although there was a tune in that play, there was a feature tune named Sonny, the tune that I always remember was this Who.

12:55.347 --> 12:56.609
That stuck in my mind.

12:56.709 --> 13:03.495
That, and this one that we picked up, this one that's taken from the Elegy, I liked that one very much.

13:04.936 --> 13:06.898
But that was the two main ones that I liked.

13:08.313 --> 13:08.614
Let's see.

13:08.715 --> 13:09.819
Am I talking too much?

13:09.960 --> 13:11.747
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:11.787 --> 13:16.787
I'm just realizing I need to get ready for the next tape.

13:17.898 --> 13:31.750
The then in the eve after you finished the supper Let's go back to the routine of the day you went back to your room and Did you all studied in your room or did you go to the library?

13:33.112 --> 13:45.863
Well those that had to go to the library for some reason went to the library, but mostly it was studying in your room and That first year what courses

13:46.720 --> 13:49.244
do you remember as being the toughest for you?

13:55.793 --> 14:01.942
I can't remember what year I had calculus, but the one that was really tough for me was calculus.

14:03.284 --> 14:12.017
And the reason for it was, I guess, besides my dumbness, was the teacher we had.

14:12.037 --> 14:13.639
He explained nothing.

14:14.075 --> 14:18.139
And frankly, I just, I never did understand that calculus.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.722
To this day, I don't understand it.

14:20.742 --> 14:23.025
Let's see, and you were an engineering major?

14:23.465 --> 14:23.745
Yes, yes.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.810
And why engineering?

14:27.890 --> 14:28.911
Do you remember why you?

14:31.234 --> 14:35.118
I guess I was always kind of mechanically inclined.

14:35.138 --> 14:39.002
I liked to take things apart and see what made the wheels go around.

14:39.674 --> 14:54.047
And then, too, this friend suggested that I take mechanical engineering, because it was about as broad a course as you could get, a little bit of everything, chemistry, civil engineering, mechanical.

14:55.449 --> 14:58.551
How did you all register for courses then?

14:59.953 --> 15:00.954
Where did you sign up?

15:01.654 --> 15:04.997
There was a room over in the old main building.

15:05.658 --> 15:07.960
I guess it was the dean's office at the time.

15:08.463 --> 15:09.745
There on the first floor.

15:11.969 --> 15:20.624
And was there a person that you went to for advice about what to take or what not to take?

15:21.225 --> 15:23.690
Was there somebody that... I don't recall that there was.

15:24.651 --> 15:26.775
It seemed to me like the course was set.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.427
It was published, and you went to the library.

15:29.507 --> 15:30.669
And you took everything?

15:30.689 --> 15:32.332
Took whatever it called for there.

15:33.394 --> 15:34.756
We had to buy our own books.

15:34.836 --> 15:35.397
I know that.

15:35.898 --> 15:38.883
Did you go to the library very often to study?

15:38.923 --> 15:41.167
No.

15:41.187 --> 15:45.034
As well as I recall, I spent most of the time in the room studying.

15:45.892 --> 15:48.394
Now, the Cushing Library was already built.

15:48.935 --> 15:49.435
No.

15:49.455 --> 15:49.816
It wasn't?

15:49.916 --> 16:01.527
It was a room in Old Main down on the end of the building, as well as I recall, on what would be the south end of the Old Main building.

16:01.787 --> 16:03.749
Was Tommy Mayo the librarian?

16:03.769 --> 16:03.869
Yes.

16:04.550 --> 16:05.331
Describe him.

16:08.734 --> 16:11.697
He was average size.

16:12.453 --> 16:27.120
dark-complected nice-looking fellow and a very personable man I think we all liked him as a teacher very much was the library a pleasant place to go and study

16:28.670 --> 16:44.106
Yes, it was very small, just one of those size of a classroom, but it was pretty well equipped with the books that were required that you needed to refer to.

16:44.126 --> 16:56.078
Now, when freshmen were getting hazed, later there would be no hazing in the library.

16:56.227 --> 16:57.249
They couldn't pick on you.

16:57.329 --> 16:58.591
Was that true in your day?

17:00.414 --> 17:01.636
As far as I know it was.

17:01.696 --> 17:05.563
I don't remember that that was a rule, but I was never bothered.

17:06.444 --> 17:12.314
Back in your room when the sophomores were hazing the freshmen, what did they do?

17:13.616 --> 17:15.720
Well,

17:16.392 --> 17:22.821
The fellas that I lived next door to, the sophomores there, if they wanted me for anything, they just knocked on the wall.

17:23.222 --> 17:23.602
All right.

17:23.622 --> 17:26.146
Banged on the wall, and I went to see what it was that they wanted.

17:26.827 --> 17:29.891
I personally was hazed very little as a freshman.

17:30.452 --> 17:31.694
Did you ever get paddled?

17:31.714 --> 17:32.175
Oh, yes.

17:32.375 --> 17:34.558
Yeah, I got paddled, but it wasn't severe.

17:37.142 --> 17:41.468
There's two occasions when I got paddled that I remember.

17:42.810 --> 17:44.172
One, when I was...

17:46.092 --> 17:47.734
I don't remember when it was now.

17:48.435 --> 17:54.363
I guess it was in my freshman year.

17:54.463 --> 17:59.429
It must have been, but an airplane fell over in what was the airport at that time.

17:59.870 --> 18:04.937
It was an Army plane, and it was broken up pretty much.

18:04.997 --> 18:08.902
And there was a fellow who was in on the football team named Jack Evans.

18:09.803 --> 18:13.568
He went over there to see this wreck, and he found a strut.

18:14.172 --> 18:20.980
that went from the fuselage up to the wing, and he got that strut, and that was his fish killer.

18:23.183 --> 18:31.332
And at the end of that freshman year, I guess he came by the room one day showing that thing off, and I said, when you graduate, I want that.

18:31.833 --> 18:35.117
Well, he gave it to me.

18:35.137 --> 18:36.298
He gave it to me, yes.

18:37.299 --> 18:41.985
And I had that strut for years and years and years,

18:42.370 --> 18:46.414
It was in my home down at Galveston, and I don't know what became of it.

18:46.434 --> 18:47.635
Now, was it a wooden strut?

18:48.256 --> 18:48.596
Oh, yes.

18:48.696 --> 18:49.137
It was wooden?

18:49.157 --> 18:50.138
It was a wooden strut.

18:50.178 --> 18:51.279
Oh, it was a beautiful thing.

18:51.519 --> 18:52.700
About that long.

18:53.081 --> 18:55.483
Where was the airport then?

18:56.104 --> 18:59.407
I think it was over there in the general area where the present airport is.

18:59.427 --> 18:59.927
Oh, really?

18:59.947 --> 19:00.388
Okay.

19:00.528 --> 19:04.252
And it was, I don't know how much of an airfield it was.

19:04.332 --> 19:08.536
Probably nothing but a fenced-in place with a sign, this is the airport.

19:09.076 --> 19:11.719
It was very small and not very well known.

19:12.307 --> 19:17.517
All right, at night, did you and your buddies ever dream up any mischief?

19:20.723 --> 19:22.526
Play any tricks on anybody else?

19:22.546 --> 19:24.951
I don't recall that we did in particular.

19:26.694 --> 19:30.862
We had some kind of a meeting one night, and I have a picture of it.

19:32.265 --> 19:34.028
I guess it was a whole band.

19:34.649 --> 19:58.402
There was a, in the middle of Milner Hall there, there was an opening, I guess you'd call it, and all of us had on some kind of a dressed up uniform, costume rather, and we were out in the middle of this area there, atrium I guess it would be, and for some reason we were all dressed up in some kind of little funny uniform.

19:58.462 --> 20:01.686
I had some kind of a cap on with a plume sticking out of the top of it.

20:02.273 --> 20:05.458
And I don't remember what the occasion was, though.

20:08.622 --> 20:12.448
I remember very well one incident when we were in the shacks.

20:16.074 --> 20:17.275
It was inspection time.

20:18.097 --> 20:25.327
Taps had blown, and I was officer of the day, I guess, there for our company, for the band, and I was making an inspection.

20:26.509 --> 20:30.475
I got down to one cabin, one shack,

20:31.180 --> 20:35.447
where I knew some freshmen lived, and the light was on, taps had blown.

20:36.549 --> 20:48.248
So I knocked on the door to see what was going on in this freshman's room, and the door opened about a couple of inches, and here came a sandwich stuck out.

20:48.269 --> 20:51.494
Well, as I mentioned, we had those wooden stoves in there.

20:51.554 --> 20:55.180
These freshmen and some sophomores had

20:55.666 --> 20:57.629
acquired a turkey of some kind.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.555
And they had fried turkey sandwiches.

21:02.457 --> 21:06.623
And what that was that passed out there was a fried turkey sandwich that they gave to me.

21:06.664 --> 21:10.369
Well, of course, I had to go in and investigate, but it was delicious.

21:11.692 --> 21:22.669
But the next week or two, when the, oh, the little magazine that came out each week, they still have it.

21:23.341 --> 21:24.104
The battalion?

21:24.365 --> 21:24.928
Battalion.

21:25.550 --> 21:33.503
The next issue of the battalion, there was quite an article in there about one of the favorite turkeys over in the chicken farm was missing.

21:34.850 --> 21:42.240
I have no idea where it went, but I know we had a good turkey sandwich one night.

21:42.421 --> 21:44.944
That was about all I can tell you about that one.

21:44.964 --> 21:46.987
Let's see, were there drowned outs then?

21:47.708 --> 21:48.249
Were there what?

21:48.349 --> 21:49.130
Drowned outs.

21:49.671 --> 21:59.845
Later, if you were a freshman, you and your buddies, and you wanted to get back at a sophomore, you'd catch him in bed, sound asleep, and then pour a lot of water on him.

21:59.960 --> 22:00.902
You drowned him out.

22:01.283 --> 22:03.567
I don't recall that we did.

22:03.647 --> 22:16.433
However, it did happen, and I remember very distinctly one night, there was a disturbance over in Leggett Hall, I think it was, which was just down the street from Milner, and Dr. Brazell,

22:17.071 --> 22:20.254
came over to see what was going on over there at Leggett Hall.

22:20.274 --> 22:28.963
And as he walked up the steps, somebody up on the ceiling dumped a barrel of water on Dr. Bazell going up those steps.

22:30.164 --> 22:31.966
And I don't remember what happened after that.

22:32.927 --> 22:35.069
But somebody was up on the roof of that hall.

22:35.129 --> 22:40.274
And when he came up there to investigate the trouble, that water was dumped on him.

22:40.294 --> 22:45.880
Describe your memory of Dr. Bazell and his personality.

22:46.079 --> 22:48.164
He had a very good personality.

22:48.184 --> 22:57.085
He appeared to be a most kind gentleman, and someone that you felt like you could go to and talk with any time you wanted to.

22:57.125 --> 23:01.776
I don't recall that I had an occasion to do it, but I felt like that

23:02.313 --> 23:06.819
I was all free to go and talk to him if I wanted to and visit with him.

23:07.280 --> 23:11.266
Did he seem strict in his rules and his beliefs?

23:12.507 --> 23:17.675
Yes, but he was very gentle and very kind, but he was quite businesslike.

23:18.776 --> 23:27.308
And he wanted attention to what you were doing and try to get the students to be good students.

23:27.288 --> 23:32.177
Did you ever see this young lady I mentioned a while ago in my speech, his daughter Elaine?

23:32.477 --> 23:33.159
Many times.

23:33.219 --> 23:33.960
Describe her.

23:35.503 --> 23:37.487
Well, she was a very attractive young lady.

23:38.929 --> 23:43.498
Mostly I remember it as my freshman year, and she was quite likable.

23:43.538 --> 23:46.984
Some of the seniors I know dated her quite a bit.

23:47.622 --> 23:53.450
And incidentally, there was another young lady there at the same time who I'm sure went through, and that was Dean Bolton's daughter.

23:54.251 --> 23:56.815
And then there was another one, and I can't remember her name.

23:56.895 --> 24:01.742
One of the other deans had a daughter there, and those three of them, they were there at the same time.

24:02.303 --> 24:03.304
And they went to classes?

24:03.725 --> 24:05.888
As far as I know, they did, yes.

24:05.908 --> 24:09.133
And did y'all think that was a good idea, to have three girls there?

24:09.393 --> 24:10.855
I don't think we thought much about it.

24:10.895 --> 24:12.718
We just wondered, well, why are they here?

24:12.818 --> 24:13.679
That was probably it.

24:14.120 --> 24:14.220
Yeah.

24:14.842 --> 24:17.526
But I don't think it bothered us any.

24:17.566 --> 24:22.033
There was another one that came there one summer when I was there.

24:22.494 --> 24:24.737
After I failed that calculus, I went to summer school.

24:25.658 --> 24:32.969
And there was a young lady there that that summer that went to classes, and I, for the sake of it, I can't remember her name or where she was from.

24:33.771 --> 24:37.997
Now, was Bolton already dean when you got there?

24:38.905 --> 24:39.687
Uh, yes.

24:39.707 --> 24:40.789
Was he dean of engineering?

24:40.809 --> 24:42.934
No, he was, yes, he was dean when I got there.

24:42.994 --> 24:44.617
Did y'all call him Bear Tracks yet?

24:45.599 --> 24:45.820
No.

24:45.940 --> 24:48.065
Later that would be his nickname was Bear Tracks.

24:48.085 --> 24:50.570
Not that I recall, no.

24:50.871 --> 24:54.058
Describe him, Dean Bolton.

24:54.078 --> 24:58.888
Uh, he, again, was a very,

24:59.172 --> 25:10.025
who seemed to be a very capable man, knew what he was doing, but he was, as I remember, he was rather strict and businesslike and wanted you to pay attention to what was going on and try to learn.

25:11.747 --> 25:16.493
How did you communicate with your family while you were a student at A&M?

25:18.255 --> 25:19.897
Did you write letters?

25:20.398 --> 25:21.439
Well, mostly letters.

25:21.499 --> 25:22.200
I was trying to think.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.264
There was a telephone on the front of Gathright Hall

25:25.818 --> 25:30.267
But usually when it was time to do some telephoning, they were lined up.

25:31.129 --> 25:33.214
And you had a hard time getting the telephone.

25:33.294 --> 25:37.162
And there again, you'd give the operator the telephone number you wanted.

25:37.242 --> 25:39.767
And later on, they'd call you back after they made a connection.

25:40.509 --> 25:42.714
But communication was mostly by mail.

25:44.077 --> 25:45.700
And where was the mailbox then?

25:47.654 --> 25:51.317
Well, it was there in Gathright Hall.

25:51.377 --> 25:53.479
The post office was in... In Gathright?

25:53.680 --> 25:55.701
In Gathright, yes.

25:55.761 --> 25:57.783
Do you remember your box number?

25:58.044 --> 25:58.304
No.

25:59.665 --> 26:02.608
291 comes my mind, but I don't think that was it.

26:02.968 --> 26:05.390
About how often did you write your mother?

26:07.072 --> 26:07.632
Once a month.

26:07.913 --> 26:08.633
And what about her?

26:08.713 --> 26:12.977
How often did she... About once a month, I guess.

26:12.997 --> 26:17.121
And during those years, how often did you go home to Galveston?

26:18.873 --> 26:23.099
Not very often.

26:23.319 --> 26:24.802
Did you go before Thanksgiving?

26:26.003 --> 26:26.965
I don't think I did.

26:26.985 --> 26:27.766
I don't remember.

26:31.251 --> 26:34.195
One time the Cadet Corps went to Austin and I couldn't go.

26:34.255 --> 26:34.956
I didn't have any money.

26:35.297 --> 26:37.099
So I went home for that Thanksgiving.

26:42.988 --> 26:45.792
I would say

26:46.261 --> 26:52.871
Although I lived fairly close to Galveston, I don't think I went over once each semester.

26:52.911 --> 26:57.038
Well, I guess mostly it was just Christmas time.

26:57.158 --> 27:00.303
I don't remember making very many trips during the school year.

27:03.347 --> 27:10.959
Describe, if you can, that first year or two, an Aggie football game Saturday.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.703
What did y'all do all day?

27:15.370 --> 27:16.511
You went to class.

27:18.154 --> 27:21.338
Went to class if you had them on Saturday morning, and most of us did.

27:21.358 --> 27:24.702
I think mine were lab classes.

27:26.144 --> 27:34.935
I remember my senior year, the representative from General Electric Company was going to be on the campus, and I didn't know it.

27:35.956 --> 27:43.065
I missed the announcement of it, and I was in the mechanical engineering lab that Saturday morning.

27:45.020 --> 28:06.622
I guess I heard about it and had on a jumpsuit, a dirty work clothes, because I was there working in the lab, and I heard he was on the campus over in the electrical engineering building, so I washed my hands right quick and went over and interviewed the gentleman, talked with him a while, and I guess filed an application for an employment with him, and went back to the lab.

28:07.283 --> 28:12.428
The lab was over, went back to the room, cleaned up, washed up and all, and then the band formed.

28:12.863 --> 28:22.890
to Morton's Cadet Corps into the dining hall and so helped me right there on that corner where the band formed was this man that I interviewed from General Electric Company.

28:23.444 --> 28:26.849
And I went over and talked with him, introduced myself to him again.

28:26.949 --> 28:30.795
And I don't know, but I think that helped me get a job at General Electric.

28:30.815 --> 28:31.736
Oh, did you get a job?

28:31.836 --> 28:32.477
I sure did.

28:32.797 --> 28:34.039
What was the beginning salary?

28:34.600 --> 28:35.742
50 cents an hour.

28:37.344 --> 28:38.085
And was this?

28:38.105 --> 28:39.547
I was in Schenectady, New York.

28:39.567 --> 28:40.869
This is after graduation?

28:40.949 --> 28:41.209
Yes.

28:42.051 --> 28:43.312
And what was your task?

28:44.654 --> 28:47.258
It was what they called a test course.

28:47.744 --> 28:57.729
You were in the testing department, testing machinery after you had it been manufactured and was being tested to be sure everything was correct and right for it.

28:58.611 --> 29:01.939
If it wasn't, then you had to make whatever corrections were necessary.

29:02.543 --> 29:03.645
And that was what year?

29:04.386 --> 29:05.407
That was in the fall of 1926.

29:05.427 --> 29:06.429
26.

29:06.549 --> 29:11.496
They had several different courses.

29:11.556 --> 29:18.847
The first one I was in was this, it was elevator controls, electric controls for elevators.

29:19.488 --> 29:20.649
That lasted a month.

29:21.851 --> 29:26.738
From there I transferred tests, testing large steam turbine generator sets.

29:27.560 --> 29:31.285
That lasted six weeks, no, three months.

29:31.720 --> 29:39.609
And on and on like that, you transfer through different departments, and most of the fellows stayed in there about two years' time.

29:40.230 --> 29:41.632
I only stayed 14 months.

29:41.652 --> 29:43.894
There was a job open down in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

29:43.914 --> 29:54.066
They needed somebody, and although I kind of wanted to stay on those tests a little bit longer, they needed somebody in Tulsa, so they transferred me down there.

29:54.637 --> 29:55.418
G.E.?

29:55.578 --> 29:56.219
Well, G.E.

29:56.420 --> 29:56.720
I see.

29:57.001 --> 29:58.383
Did you stay with them a long time?

29:58.543 --> 30:00.125
My entire professional life.

30:00.386 --> 30:00.826
Oh, really?

30:01.808 --> 30:01.908
Yeah.

30:01.928 --> 30:03.070
Oh.

30:03.090 --> 30:13.866
And what was more, after I retired, at my retirement party, oh, they gave us a little talk, and then they asked me to make some remarks, which I did.

30:13.887 --> 30:17.332
And when I got through, then somebody said, what are you going to do now?

30:18.393 --> 30:21.759
I said, well, I'm going to go on vacation, I guess.

30:21.859 --> 30:23.361
Why would I go down the valley?

30:24.657 --> 30:27.761
And I was trying to think of something to say.

30:27.821 --> 30:39.996
I said, well, when I get back, I'm going over to Manpower Incorporated and sign up with them, let them farm me out somewhere, knowing that these engineering concerns would hire people, get a contract, and after it was over, they let them go.

30:40.957 --> 30:43.019
And then you'd get another one, a job would come up.

30:43.039 --> 30:45.462
Well, anyhow, that's what I did.

30:45.602 --> 30:49.387
And when I came back, the guy called me.

30:49.687 --> 30:53.432
Well, he called me the next morning and said, did you mean what you said?

30:53.918 --> 30:55.059
I said, yes, I did.

30:55.099 --> 30:58.822
And he said, well, when you go on your vacation trip, when you come back, give me a call.

30:59.123 --> 30:59.723
And I did.

31:17.759 --> 31:23.925
And it was a little bit different work than what I had been doing, sales engineering work.

31:24.445 --> 31:26.271
And this was mostly inside work.
