WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:24.503
sort of a rat-a-tat-tat, you know,

00:02.562 --> 00:24.503
rate and he had a huge memory and he was also the 
first professor that I had that was

00:02.562 --> 00:24.503
internationally traveled and had met all of these 
heroes of the plant physiology area he had been to

00:24.753 --> 00:51.334
conferences where they were and I remember one 
time while I was still a student he went to an

00:24.753 --> 00:51.334
international conference on plant growth 
substances came back with pictures of all these

00:24.753 --> 00:51.334
people you know and uh and uh he wanted us to 
remember names and to know what different labs

00:24.753 --> 00:51.334
were doing and everything like that so he made it 
very personal and uh and of course there were funny

00:51.820 --> 01:18.553
stories about all these uh not all of them but some 
of the big stars in the biological area he knew a lot

00:51.820 --> 01:18.553
of those because he traveled around some he was uh 
um he was not a what i would call a father figure you

01:21.503 --> 01:48.878
know he wasn't the kind of guy that came around and 
put his arm around you and your shoulder and you

01:21.503 --> 01:48.878
know made you feel like he was your grandfather or 
her older father or something but when i first met

01:21.503 --> 01:48.878
him he had young children and his wife was 
extremely ambitious she was she was always having

01:49.246 --> 02:11.929
some kind of a social function for all of his 
students and patting us all on the head and

01:49.246 --> 02:11.929
encouraging us and telling us to find us some of our 
friends to work with Dr. Hall and everything so she

01:49.246 --> 02:11.929
he was a hard worker wasn't he he was a hard worker 
and uh uh he uh was, you know, I didn't realize it at

02:14.373 --> 02:30.054
the time, but he was very much a visionary in his 
sense of what was going on in biology and the way

02:14.373 --> 02:30.054
plants were working. And I remember one time he 
telling me something about he thought he worked on

02:30.574 --> 02:39.987
ethylene that proved to be a plant hormone. And I 
remember him telling me one time that you know,

02:43.600 --> 02:58.779
that he thought that individual flowers made 
ethylene and that they made enough that they could

02:43.600 --> 02:58.779
sense their own ethylene and that this would cause 
them, you know, to do certain things. And I

02:58.879 --> 03:02.944
thought, boy, you've got some imagination, you 
know. I didn't say that, but I just thought you are,

03:02.964 --> 03:09.051
I just cannot believe that you really think that 
that uh that plants could make that much or you know

03:09.402 --> 03:32.878
that they'd make enough that an individual flower 
would be able to tell what was you know what it was

03:09.402 --> 03:32.878
supposed to do because of what it made but but that 
proved to be just totally correct you know years

03:09.402 --> 03:32.878
later but at that time um We would take, I built some 
plastic boxes that were about four feet square and

03:34.985 --> 03:55.250
would fill them full of plants and flow air through 
that and collect all of the ethylene from that air

03:34.985 --> 03:55.250
for six hours or something like that and I would 
just barely have enough to measure. And, you know,

03:56.332 --> 03:59.035
years later we could measure the ethylene from one 
very small flower that it made in 15 or 20 minutes,

03:59.740 --> 04:08.692
you know, with great accuracy. So as the 
instrumentation became better, a lot of the

04:09.273 --> 04:17.304
things that he predicted turned out to be true. But 
he led me by personal example more than anything

04:18.085 --> 04:26.136
else, not so much by what he said, He read, uh, you 
know, extensively. He, uh, uh, was always

04:31.446 --> 04:46.373
thinking about how facts from this lab and another 
lab would fit together and would make you

04:31.446 --> 04:46.373
understand something that you couldn't 
understand if you didn't bring those two things

04:31.446 --> 04:46.373
together. And, uh, so all of that was, uh, really a 
good example for me, and once I got into his lab,

04:50.602 --> 05:01.842
well, uh, you know, that's, that was the beginning 
of my scientific. How long did that take after you

05:02.283 --> 05:06.430
started out your graduate? Okay, so, I. A year? 
Well, before, I, uh, I finished my master's degree

05:13.906 --> 05:21.172
and then moved in to the PhD program at Wayne Hall. 
And I guess for about a year and a half, I was mostly

05:21.192 --> 05:28.759
doing coursework. And within another year, I was 
beginning to get data that was totally unheard of

05:28.779 --> 05:43.812
at the time and turned out to be really uh you know a 
big thing in plant biology uh and uh and would you

05:44.838 --> 06:12.583
know I did it because Wayne pointed me down this 
trail and uh he just brought me one reprint he he

05:44.838 --> 06:12.583
laid it on my desk and he says uh I'd like for you to 
figure out what's happening here you know and So he

06:13.171 --> 06:18.259
didn't tell me how to do the experiments or, you 
know, what to do or anything. He just said, this is

06:18.380 --> 06:23.388
your baby, you know, you've got to figure this out. 
About how many grad, at, at, as the, you began to

06:23.929 --> 06:32.623
work with him, about how many graduate students 
did he direct? He probably had three or four other

06:32.643 --> 06:38.132
students at the time and, uh, Not all of them were 
working on the same projects and one of them was a

06:38.737 --> 07:05.921
student from Argentina and so he sort of became my 
mentor and I learned a lot of techniques from him

06:38.737 --> 07:05.921
and I ended up extending some of the things that he 
did on his dissertation. Did Dr. Hall have any

07:08.723 --> 07:20.059
either expressed or just otherwise obvious 
guidelines, rules, principles that you graduate

07:08.723 --> 07:20.059
students were to follow?

07:26.548 --> 07:28.691
I don't remember so much about that. He did not have 
a set of like I expect you to work so many hours a week

07:32.348 --> 07:37.435
or anything like that. He, uh, um, I remember, I

07:38.035 --> 07:59.503
remember, you know, occasionally he'd tell me 
something like, well, I see you up here every

07:38.035 --> 07:59.503
night, I wish so and so was up here or something like 
that, you know, so he had some He had a student or two

07:59.956 --> 08:09.407
during that era that was kind of lazy and he would 
hint to me that he was glad that I was not like the

07:59.956 --> 08:09.407
lazy one. And you were putting in long hours? Yes, 
very long hours. So when you, after your master's

08:15.354 --> 08:25.506
degree, when you went over to start studying with 
him, what was your perception at that point of your

08:15.354 --> 08:25.506
goal? What were you, were you thinking about then 
being a faculty? research person? I was thinking

08:32.778 --> 08:38.208
about a basic science research career. I had not, I 
had not at that time thought so much about

08:38.388 --> 08:47.344
university faculty as maybe maybe somebody like 
DuPont or Dow or maybe, maybe USDA basic science

08:47.510 --> 08:58.320
lab or something like that. But I was thinking at 
this point about a, a

08:58.380 --> 09:11.412
more experimental science career. And I guess the 
thing that, that, caused me to leave ecology which

09:15.404 --> 09:42.255
was what the range management business was all 
about was that it was not very quantitative that it

09:15.404 --> 09:42.255
was more subjective and I did not feel comfortable 
walking out into a field and saying this is sixty

09:15.404 --> 09:42.255
percent this kind of plant and seven you know 
seventeen percent that kind of plant and

09:15.404 --> 09:42.255
everything because I for whatever reason that was 
just not my calling. Now did you feel in working

09:48.852 --> 09:57.621
with Dr. Hall that you were kind of on the cutting 
edge of where science was heading?

09:57.641 --> 10:11.517
Well, at, I guess at first, I, my first impression 
from what some of his students were doing was that

09:57.641 --> 10:11.517
they were, They were making advances in 
agricultural technology, but they were not

10:12.239 --> 10:22.837
really doing much for science. But he had this one 
student, the Argentinian guy, who was actually

10:23.217 --> 10:31.431
trying to find out how things work. And that was 
very interesting to me, and that was really what I

10:32.233 --> 10:37.842
wanted to do. was to understand how things worked. 
So once I got started, I, I felt that I was, uh,

10:40.883 --> 10:52.878
actually, uh, making progress at doing that. And I 
remember going to a meeting where, uh, somebody,

10:53.559 --> 11:04.993
there was, Hall was involved in several, uh, uh, 
feuds i guess you'd say scientific feuds about

11:05.564 --> 11:35.503
theories and so this person hall didn't go to this 
particular conference and i was still a graduate

11:05.564 --> 11:35.503
student and this person said well uh you know we 
we've just facing all these uh unexplainable

11:05.564 --> 11:35.503
mysteries and uh maybe it's just ethylene that's 
you know that's the solution to all of these

11:05.564 --> 11:35.503
unexplained mysteries well everybody there 
laughed, you know, that was a big joke and uh, and so

11:35.483 --> 11:59.668
then he said, everybody go around the room and tell 
us what you're gonna, what you're doing and uh, you

11:35.483 --> 11:59.668
know, what you're gonna talk about at this meeting 
and this was uh, dinner, after dinner the night

11:35.483 --> 11:59.668
before the conference started and it was a small 
conference and everybody kind of knew each other

12:00.172 --> 12:04.500
So they finally came around to me, and I said, well, 
I'm Paige Morgan. I'm Wayne Hall's graduate

12:04.600 --> 12:06.423
student. I'm working on auxin-induced ethylene 
production, and I'm going to explain to you

12:06.463 --> 12:14.657
tomorrow how important it really is. And you've 
been talking about it all evening, and actually

12:14.778 --> 12:21.389
what you've said in jest is going to turn out to be 
the truth. And the room got as quiet as that had been

12:26.243 --> 12:36.012
making fun of Hall's interest in Athelaine was one 
of the USDA leaders in this whole area. Well, at

12:36.693 --> 12:49.825
that point, I felt like that I could stand up on my 
feet with these guys and that I knew as much about

12:36.693 --> 12:49.825
some things as they did. I didn't know that I knew 
everything, you know. Well, it turned out that You

12:55.893 --> 13:07.605
know, years later, this guy finally had to admit 
that we had, you know, really done something

12:55.893 --> 13:07.605
significant with our, with my dissertation 
research. Now, Wayne Hall was always modest,

13:07.625 --> 13:10.733
wasn't he? Yes. I can't imagine him ever being 
flashy. No, he was the kind of person that would

13:16.796 --> 13:24.911
sort of stay in the background. Did he ever get mad 
at anything? Did he ever show anger? I don't ever

13:30.661 --> 13:35.670
remember him doing

13:30.661 --> 13:35.670
that. I know that he was involved in several 
personal conflicts

13:35.920 --> 13:50.344
with people here at A&M and other places, but I 
never saw him raise his voice or anything like

13:35.920 --> 13:50.344
that. I never heard that either. He always seemed 
very mild. So that, in effect, that course that you

13:53.870 --> 14:01.843
were assigned to take as a As an elective. As an 
elective. It was a life changing event, wasn't it?

14:07.700 --> 14:08.181
It was. That was,

14:08.281 --> 14:28.270
Dr. Darrow, by saying that you need to know how 
plants work in order to put herbicides on them and

14:08.281 --> 14:28.270
kill them, actually changed my whole interest and 
that's what led me eventually to become a faculty

14:28.925 --> 14:34.053
member. Alright, getting ready now to kind of 
summarize here.

14:41.966 --> 14:46.292
Looking back, what did you learn at A&M that has 
been important in your life?

14:52.442 --> 14:55.607
Well, you know, the

14:59.873 --> 15:17.125
The lessons were from the core were personal 
responsibility and leadership and doing your

14:59.873 --> 15:17.125
best and honesty and integrity.

15:19.529 --> 15:22.675
All of those were not only just taught in theory, 
but we had the opportunity to learn them in

15:22.908 --> 15:32.939
everyday experience. So that was all good. From 
the

15:36.624 --> 15:50.940
faculty, I saw a lot of people that were kind and 
fair and considerate.

15:52.878 --> 16:09.074
I guess some of the ones that I remember that were 
not in my major field were I remember them because

15:52.878 --> 16:09.074
of their human qualities, not so much because of 
anything they ever said in a lecture or anything

15:52.878 --> 16:09.074
like that. Are there some of those to whom you feel 
particularly grateful to mention? Well, I

16:15.920 --> 16:21.045
remember

16:23.067 --> 16:44.555
Homer Sperry and

16:23.067 --> 16:44.555
Waldrop in range management and Jerry or Gerald 
Thomas in range management that became president

16:23.067 --> 16:44.555
of New Mexico State, I believe. They were all 
really fine people.

16:52.413 --> 16:56.718
I mentioned Professor Dobson in biology. I don't 
know why, but I became acquainted with John

16:57.399 --> 17:08.212
Beckham in chemistry very early. And he always 
remembered me, you know, and it was a great

17:09.213 --> 17:14.259
encouragement. I met Robert Skravanek as an Alpha 
Zeta student going around getting people signed

17:21.657 --> 17:28.927
my key and knew him all of the years after that. I met 
a man in civil engineering. I took a surveying

17:34.174 --> 17:40.783
course and met Mr. Harrington in civil 
engineering. I met Mr. Varvel in Walter Varvel in

17:41.965 --> 17:51.057
psychology. He just was such a fine person that I 
always remembered him. Did

17:56.474 --> 18:02.181
John Beckham have a nickname? With that deep 
voice, I've always thought he would have been a

18:03.422 --> 18:08.127
sitting duck for a nickname, and I never heard one. 
Yeah, I don't know whether I had a course from him or

18:08.447 --> 18:11.891
not. See, we knew him well at church. Right. I, you 
know, I looked at the catalog and he must have been

18:14.864 --> 18:31.354
just an instructor when I started out here and I,

18:14.864 --> 18:31.354
but he made a good impression on me. There was a man 
in math, J.R. Hillman, that I had for calculus as a

18:31.908 --> 18:42.962
beginning graduate student, but he made a good 
impression on me. I had an acquaintance in the P.E.

18:46.226 --> 18:52.073
department, Emil Amaliga, who I had two or three 
P.E. courses from and I had advice from after that.

18:55.837 --> 19:11.719
and he also taught me a lesson in a negative way, you 
know, and that was he died from lung cancer and he

18:55.837 --> 19:11.719
probably got the lung cancer from smoking and so I 
picked You know, someplace along, uh, before I got

19:12.863 --> 19:30.366
to be too old, I noticed that people, some people 
made bad decisions about their health, you know,

19:12.863 --> 19:30.366
the things that they should have done that would 
have made their lives more longer and happier and,

19:12.863 --> 19:30.366
uh, I resolved you know not to make repeat those 
kinds of mistakes so he was one of those and there

19:31.409 --> 20:01.112
was a man in some engineering department that I had 
his daughter in a bible class and he his name was

19:31.409 --> 20:01.112
Amix and he died suddenly from heart failure at age 
like 43 or something like that and that's when I

20:01.430 --> 20:13.785
decided that I was not going to just work and just 
have stress and just not, you know, not exercise

20:01.430 --> 20:13.785
and that sort of thing. He was in the petroleum 
engineering department. I also knew Dr. Isabel in

20:17.950 --> 20:24.859
chemistry. Texas. Tex Isabel. And I had an early 
acquaintanceship with Harry Kunkel and he was a

20:27.142 --> 20:35.152
positive influence. He and I have this Northwest 
Texas ranching heritage in common and he was

20:35.212 --> 20:45.325
always a big encouragement.

20:48.865 --> 21:08.511
I had a course from him one time that met on Saturday 
like 10 o'clock my senior year in fact on Saturday

20:48.865 --> 21:08.511
morning at 9 or 10 o'clock every Saturday we had a 
quiz because he knew no one would be there if he

20:48.865 --> 21:08.511
didn't give that quiz but I you know survived that I 
knew R.C. Potts pretty well and he was a good

21:11.040 --> 21:15.326
influence. He's the one that made me realize that I 
was not going to be able to make a living on a couple

21:15.967 --> 21:25.462
of hundred acres of northwest Texas land. I got to 
know Dr. McAfee pretty well and

21:35.018 --> 21:57.246
I knew George Kunze before he was dean and I met some 
of the people in Ag Eco and knew them when I was going

21:35.018 --> 21:57.246
around as an undergraduate with this alpha zeta 
key to get it signed and some of those guys were

21:35.018 --> 21:57.246
around for a number of years. And I'd be remiss if I 
didn't say that one of the people that really was a

21:58.053 --> 22:18.401
positive influence was Howard Johan, who was also 
in the department that Hall was in and stayed there

21:58.053 --> 22:18.401
his whole career and was a good man and a good 
influence. He was one of the people that said the

22:18.421 --> 22:27.874
best job in the whole world is a full professor at a 
major university. Don't ever discredit, you

22:28.073 --> 22:35.942
know, don't ever think poorly of that. All right, 
if you were hired today as a consultant to the A&M

22:35.962 --> 22:51.121
leadership, and you can define leadership 
however you want to, what advice would you give

22:35.962 --> 22:51.121
them about what A&M's future should be? What 
should A&M be doing or not doing from here on?

22:59.123 --> 23:09.927
Well, it seems to me like that there are a lot of good 
things in our past that we don't want to lose and the

22:59.123 --> 23:09.927
big you know, the big fraternity sorority concept 
where everybody is judged on their own merit and

23:11.932 --> 23:24.248
not on the color of their skin or how much money 
their parents make or this sort of thing. That's

23:24.969 --> 23:27.231
extremely important. We can't continue to be the 
university that that,

23:38.830 --> 23:41.915
is different if, if we give up on that. So, so that, 
that's important and it, it has to be achieved in

23:42.176 --> 23:54.818
ways in addition to just the Corps of Cadets 
obviously. So all of the, all of the things about

23:54.958 --> 24:00.147
student life and the traditions that influence 
student life, the positive ones have to be

24:00.532 --> 24:24.025
promoted and extended and the leadership 
experiences which have been amplified and spread

24:00.532 --> 24:24.025
out a lot since I was a student, all of the MSC 
activities and everything are very important and

24:25.996 --> 24:36.779
I think that, you know, that we're doing things 
that we would have never thought of like the summer

24:25.996 --> 24:36.779
abroad and things. When I was a student, no one 
would have ever even conceived of that being

24:37.019 --> 24:46.840
something you could do.

24:48.473 --> 25:11.410
All of that, you know, in the context of the 
traditions, the commitment to integrity and

24:48.473 --> 25:11.410
responsibility and I guess a while ago I didn't say 
hard work, but that was one of the things, you know,

24:48.473 --> 25:11.410
that we took for granted was hard work and that 
school was more than just a big party. And I think we

25:13.145 --> 25:16.009
want to, you know, keep those. I think we have a 
significant issue between acceptance

25:17.951 --> 25:42.561
of everyone and the

25:17.951 --> 25:42.561
personal values that different people have and 
how do you How do you accept everyone without

25:42.946 --> 25:50.275
violating your own personal values? That 
continues to be something I think that's a

25:51.477 --> 25:57.725
challenge for the future.

26:02.611 --> 26:12.143
There's merit in both sides of that and I think we 
want to find a compromise which will be will

26:12.612 --> 26:26.674
leave us a

26:12.612 --> 26:26.674
place that are producing people that can be 
admired and respected and trusted. And

26:27.295 --> 26:37.692
I guess I still see the student as the basic 
product. And in my area, the science is the

26:39.038 --> 26:43.643
secondary product. I'm still more proud of my 
students that I've trained than the discoveries

26:44.183 --> 26:49.709
that we've made. And I think that both of them are 
valuable, though. And I now have a graduate

27:00.100 --> 27:06.227
student that's retiring.

27:09.464 --> 27:10.506
Just this summer. Okay, I've got two more 
questions. Okay. If somebody walked up to you and

27:16.775 --> 27:26.870
handed you a check for a million dollars with one 
requirement, you must pass it on to A&M, for what

27:16.775 --> 27:26.870
purpose would you want that money used?

27:29.835 --> 27:32.359
If you could make a gift, you get to choose. Yeah, I 
think I would put it into some kind of an endowed

27:32.499 --> 27:38.408
professorship. I don't think we have enough. I 
think that

27:41.011 --> 28:05.070
when each department has several of those chairs 
that they will,

27:41.011 --> 28:05.070
that we can

27:41.011 --> 28:05.070
have the level of

28:07.582 --> 28:26.106
get out of the cycle of always being behind in our 
appropriations from the state, you know, and

28:07.582 --> 28:26.106
going through these cycles where our salaries are 
not competitive and we're losing this bright star

28:07.582 --> 28:26.106
and that bright star and then we get the salaries 
back up and that sort of thing. And I think for the

28:26.146 --> 28:30.552
long run, for the long stable, status of the 
university, you need a substantial core of

28:31.038 --> 28:38.666
endowed chairs. Alright, have we left anything 
out? I've only got one question left. Have we left

28:43.952 --> 29:00.690
out something, some things you...

28:43.952 --> 29:00.690
No, I've thought about this on several occasions 
since we scheduled to do this and I

28:43.952 --> 29:00.690
don't really Oh, well there was one thing I was 
going to tell you about and that was that I had the

29:02.797 --> 29:32.044
experience after graduation

29:02.797 --> 29:32.044
while I was in graduate school of having to defend 
the decision to add women and to make the corps

29:02.797 --> 29:32.044
optional with a bunch of people at an army reserve 
summer camp and I remember they were really angry

29:32.733 --> 29:56.648
and uh and I remember what I told them which it ended 
up being the truth you know that that we could stay

29:32.733 --> 29:56.648
where we were and become a non-factor in the 
history of Texas and the world or we could take the

29:32.733 --> 29:56.648
good of what we had and go forward with it and become 
a great major university and that we were just at

29:56.813 --> 30:01.630
that moment making that decision. And they had no 
vision for what A&M has become. And if we had gone

30:11.132 --> 30:16.020
the other route, we would be back where- Sentinel.

30:18.704 --> 30:22.671
Sentinel are some of those- And VMI. Some of those 
other very small, very elitist 400, 500 student

30:23.131 --> 30:34.870
institutions, or 2,000 student institutions. 
And I have no regrets that we didn't make the right

30:35.356 --> 30:40.422
decision. And I gather that Wayne Hall was one of 
the positive? With Cooper, right. With Cooper and

30:46.109 --> 30:50.454
one other person who's, I don't remember. They had 
all these sessions and would have these big

30:51.215 --> 30:58.563
discussions with General Rutter. And I gather 
that that one that I mentioned a while ago, that

30:59.925 --> 31:04.350
apparently Lyndon said you don't have any choice 
about integration. That's already been decided.

31:08.279 --> 31:09.722
You've got to do it, Earl. And I'll back you. John 
Connolly will back you. Tiger Teague will back

31:12.309 --> 31:13.552
you. Come on, let's do it. All right, the last 
question, then, is what feelings do you carry?
