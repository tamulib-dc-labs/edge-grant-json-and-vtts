00:02.005 --> 00:15.407
It was a freshman privilege to have the carry matches, and if you could once again do this low crawl below the table, you could go over and you could light the upper class one's paper napkin and have it burn.

00:16.709 --> 00:21.377
Or the other thing, it was always a freshman privilege to start a Wildcat.

00:21.397 --> 00:23.440
Somebody would tell you to stand up.

00:23.892 --> 00:26.417
and yell, beat the hell out of whoever you were playing.

00:26.437 --> 00:29.843
An example you were playing at the University of Houston, it was beat the hell out of Cougar High.

00:30.885 --> 00:34.332
Or if you were playing Baylor, beat the hell out of Baylor or wherever.

00:34.492 --> 00:45.393
You never wanted to stand up and beat the hell out of somebody that other people couldn't hear.

00:45.513 --> 00:46.896
And after a while,

00:47.332 --> 01:04.209
in your outfit it became clear which freshman could stand up and yell and which one would get into the spirit because you could almost give a little speech when you say, beat the hell out of somebody.

01:05.570 --> 01:17.102
You could stand up on your chair or if you were a really bold freshman you would just stand up on the table and you would get down in a humpet position with your hands on your knees and at the top of your voice

01:17.386 --> 01:20.269
but very much under control so you didn't slur it all together.

01:20.329 --> 01:33.204
You could go beat the ever-living, complex, confounding, complex hell out of those whatever from Baylor.

01:33.645 --> 01:35.847
And then you'd go, yay, and everybody stood up and yelled.

01:35.887 --> 01:42.194
But the Wildcats, there was only three in the mess hall when people would stand up, so it was the first three.

01:42.595 --> 01:46.279
So an outfit that had a particularly loud freshman or a particularly

01:48.807 --> 01:53.055
I know spirited to make sure that they got the first one.

01:53.115 --> 02:05.016
So as soon as you sat down, if some upperclassman told you to get up and lead a Wildcat, that was kind of a, I guess, a positive signal that you felt good about.

02:05.036 --> 02:11.608
So some of the things that you did in the mess hall, like they weren't going to send you over to another table if you were going to get caught.

02:12.263 --> 02:18.216
So being singled out for some of these details was a positive recognition.

02:18.697 --> 02:24.028
Now this, I'll call it mischief, at mealtime occurred more often at supper

02:25.882 --> 02:36.614
Well, it didn't seem like it occurred very much at breakfast because people were still waking up, the upper classroom, and the attendance at morning chow, not everybody went to morning chow.

02:37.895 --> 02:41.579
At noon chow it seemed like everybody was at noon chow.

02:41.599 --> 02:51.670
Evening chow, for whatever, some of the people might go out to eat or be going on dates or going to study or whatever, but it seemed like at noon chow everybody was there all the time.

02:52.342 --> 03:04.118
But the evening chow was pretty well attended too because the meals were not only being pleasurable to eat but they were also a social time.

03:04.338 --> 03:14.552
They were also the gossip time and the catch up on the news time and find out about this outfit and that outfit and the upperclassmen were

03:15.275 --> 03:20.282
would talk about other members of the outfit and what was going on.

03:20.562 --> 03:26.450
Of course, freshmen were not allowed to talk unless they were spoken to, and their eyes were straight to the front.

03:27.952 --> 03:30.335
It's amazing how much you can see when you're looking straight ahead.

03:30.475 --> 03:34.701
Of course, your ears, you pick up everything.

03:34.985 --> 03:54.563
you quickly know what's in your outfit and who the good guys are and who the bad guys are and who's respected and who's not respected and who's getting good grades and who's got a girlfriend that's a hot and heavy relationship and which girlfriends are about ready to dump them, etc.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.314
Go to class now.

03:57.515 --> 04:01.922
What did, when you went to class, what did you take with you?

04:02.362 --> 04:06.589
What did you assume was the normal behavior pattern in class?

04:07.491 --> 04:08.592
But let's back up first.

04:09.974 --> 04:12.899
How did you select your courses that first semester?

04:12.919 --> 04:13.440
Do you remember?

04:13.921 --> 04:18.508
Well, I came, I didn't

04:19.518 --> 04:25.267
I knew very little about college other than the fact that it was a good thing to go there.

04:26.308 --> 04:34.501
So my first semester I came to Texas A&M, I was going to major in general business, just for want of a, okay, here I am type of thing.

04:36.103 --> 04:39.829
And throughout my time at A&M, I had a clipboard.

04:40.310 --> 04:43.635
And on my clipboard, and I still have the clipboard to this day.

04:43.750 --> 05:11.850
on my clipboard i used to keep my class schedule so where i was supposed to be what i was supposed to do and i always carried a paper with me to take notes because i was a note i was a note taker in class and oftentimes i would carry a book but i don't i don't remember carrying a whole lot of books but i did have this i had this clipboard that that took with me and i and i and i took notes and best i can recall as i majored in

05:13.619 --> 05:15.122
business for the first semester.

05:15.382 --> 05:27.645
I think the second semester I switched over to major in physical education because coming to college for me was the first time

05:28.790 --> 05:34.759
that I really started making decisions on my own, like I made the decision to join the Marine Corps and then I told my parents.

05:35.681 --> 05:48.621
I made the decision to switch from general business to physical education because I did some soul searching and decided if I wasn't going to be in the service that I wanted to work with people and be a coach.

05:50.390 --> 05:56.581
Later on, I started taking lots of English courses.

05:56.821 --> 06:01.209
They didn't have double majors in those days, but I really enjoyed English and writing and speaking.

06:02.491 --> 06:14.052
I figured that that would help me most as a Marine officer to be able to write and speak and interact.

06:14.605 --> 06:32.365
It must have been my sophomore year that I became desirous of becoming a yell leader because I had, I guess, come under the spell, if you will, of the Aggie spirit and the fact that the yell leaders were the ones that focused that spirit of the Corps of Cadets.

06:33.727 --> 06:39.073
I decided to become a run for yell leader, and I was successfully elected.

06:40.154 --> 06:42.857
I was a yell leader both my junior and senior year.

06:44.390 --> 06:51.944
And by this time I had, between my freshman and sophomore year, I had also gone off to Quantico, Virginia for six weeks of training in the Marine Corps.

06:53.447 --> 06:59.399
And that was another eye-opening experience with regards to the Marine Corps.

06:59.779 --> 07:06.432
And my resolve to become a Marine officer was strengthened.

07:08.015 --> 07:11.799
and stimulated by my exposure six weeks at Iquantico.

07:11.819 --> 07:21.871
So when I came back to the Corps for my sophomore year and then throughout my time in the Corps, I was very fixed in what I was going to do after I graduated.

07:21.911 --> 07:37.650
A lot of the things that I wanted to do in the Corps, I made a conscious decision to participate and to experience and to seek out various things so that it would enhance the qualities that I would be bringing to being an officer in the Marine Corps.

07:38.120 --> 07:46.230
Back to that first semester, do you remember going through any registration line in either Cebisa or G. Raleigh?

07:46.610 --> 07:55.481
No, I don't remember, but I do remember after that other semesters of going through the drill over at Cebisa, all the lines outside, etc.

07:55.862 --> 08:00.087
What about that first semester, do you remember some courses, some teachers?

08:00.427 --> 08:01.208
I remember

08:02.470 --> 08:10.223
I remember a history course from Mr. Ashcraft in History 105.

08:10.404 --> 08:11.545
I always loved history.

08:12.026 --> 08:25.930
He was an exceptionally good teacher, and I remember being right on the borderline between a B and an A in the class, and the final exam was, I remember just studying and

08:25.910 --> 08:34.907
I remember I got a B-plus in the final exam for a B in the course, and one of the things he wrote on the back of my paper, he drew a little shovel.

08:35.360 --> 08:41.407
and said, the order of the shovel is yours for all that BS you've shoveled my way, but you really didn't answer the question.

08:42.408 --> 08:42.748
Oh, boy.

08:43.029 --> 08:58.386
But I remember him being good in his un-air-conditioned classrooms at one o'clock in the afternoon after a big meal in Duncan of still taking notes and just a superb instructor.

08:59.708 --> 09:00.028
English?

09:01.410 --> 09:01.790
English.

09:02.331 --> 09:03.392
Do you remember?

09:04.216 --> 09:09.203
I wish I could.

09:09.243 --> 09:15.813
I don't remember the English, but English instruction I thought was outstanding.

09:15.833 --> 09:21.702
That's one reason I was motivated towards taking more when I was here.

09:23.183 --> 09:27.429
Everything fromâ€”I had some success in writing.

09:27.689 --> 09:32.735
The teacher would say, in fact, the writing is not up to standard.

09:32.775 --> 09:33.877
You all have to pay attention.

09:33.897 --> 09:36.200
You're not going to be able to do well, etc., etc.

09:37.001 --> 09:47.875
These grades, there was one B-, two Cs, three Ds, and twenty S. And I'd get my paper back, and I'd either be a B- or C. I'd be right up at the top.

09:48.175 --> 09:52.039
Part of that was because my mother had been a newspaper reporter and a newspaper writer.

09:53.320 --> 10:00.047
One of the things that I remember interacting during junior high and high school was my mom helping me with that.

10:00.128 --> 10:09.497
My dad was kind of the math guy and my mother was the English guy, but because my dad was on the road a lot, I had probably more, I guess, scholastic interaction at the high school level with my mom.

10:09.678 --> 10:15.464
So I was comfortable writing and it was accepted.

10:15.504 --> 10:16.765
I remember that.

10:18.314 --> 10:33.912
Algebra was hard for me, but I remember that the prof told us that there would be no question on the final that we hadn't been on one of our previous tests.

10:33.932 --> 10:36.458
So I went through and worked every problem.

10:37.332 --> 10:43.160
and knew how to do it that we had had before, you know, by sheer hard work, and then we came in the final.

10:43.821 --> 11:05.652
Lo and behold, there was ten problems with a bonus one, and I still remember, you know, one of those things that stick with you thirty-plus years later, I got a hundred and ten on the final, and I think raised my grade all the way up to a B, which was, you know, but it's just, I found the academics challenging

11:06.813 --> 11:10.209
but not insurmountable.

11:10.229 --> 11:12.520
Of course, I didn't major in the hardest thing.

11:12.661 --> 11:15.253
I often wish that political science or history

11:17.242 --> 11:37.242
20 years later down the road as a general officer and a colonel in the Marine Corps, sometimes I thought that I might have been better suited to have studied something different in college, but I wouldn't trade the Texas A&M education both in the classroom and outside the classroom for anything.

11:37.222 --> 11:48.562
What did you and your close friends that freshman year, what did you all decide were the basic guidelines about attendance and behavior and so forth in class?

11:49.905 --> 11:51.247
Did you all go to class regularly?

11:52.289 --> 11:54.032
I went to every class.

11:55.312 --> 11:59.400
ever, the whole time I was a student, I never missed a class that I can recall.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.283
I don't ever.

12:01.704 --> 12:04.649
Did people misbehave in class?

12:04.670 --> 12:04.870
No.

12:06.052 --> 12:10.060
You went to class and it was never.

12:10.120 --> 12:14.107
I mean, I don't remember anybody ever misbe... Sleeping in class?

12:14.187 --> 12:15.109
Did anybody go to sleep?

12:16.203 --> 12:20.647
I'm sure there were, but I don't remember.

12:21.007 --> 12:25.812
I remember one guy one time who was a very marginal football player.

12:25.832 --> 12:29.695
I remember one guy cheating in class, but he was so dumb, I don't even think he knew how to cheat.

12:29.775 --> 12:33.018
But I don't remember people sleeping.

12:33.078 --> 12:34.299
I don't remember people cutting up.

12:34.559 --> 12:35.600
I don't remember cheating.

12:38.303 --> 12:45.349
But in some ways, it was just an idealistic...

12:46.477 --> 12:47.879
experience at Texas A&M.

12:47.939 --> 12:55.592
I was one of these guys that shortly after I got here fell in love with it and it's just, it stayed with me.

12:55.612 --> 13:05.288
And I guess in many ways I feel like I, you know, owe my life to my experiences and values that I picked up in the Corps.

13:05.328 --> 13:08.894
And of course, you know, I guess we all pick up values all along in our lives.

13:08.914 --> 13:11.218
We pick them up from our parents and from our

13:11.772 --> 13:31.409
teachers and coaches as we go through, but at Texas A&M, the values that I picked up from the upperclassmen and then from my classmates and from Aggies were what, in many ways, were the most sustaining and the most valuable lessons that I picked up.

13:32.310 --> 13:41.037
If you and or a friend wanted to kind of go somewhere to relax, you had an hour without classes,

13:41.405 --> 13:42.146
Where did you go?

13:42.206 --> 13:45.611
Where could you slip away?

13:47.072 --> 13:58.748
Well, I remember coming to Cushing Library and it was always comfortable in Cushing Library and I don't ever remember getting harassed.

14:00.270 --> 14:06.518
And I always liked magazines and newspapers and when we had to write papers I always

14:07.949 --> 14:11.174
I found the research kind of enjoyable.

14:11.194 --> 14:13.778
I mean, it wasn't a pain to do it.

14:14.860 --> 14:15.882
I remember relaxing there.

14:15.902 --> 14:18.666
I also remember the All-Faith Chapel.

14:18.967 --> 14:22.392
I know where the room is over there right now, but I went over there a couple of times and studied.

14:23.734 --> 14:29.063
I also remember various times and places in the MSC.

14:29.718 --> 14:32.241
Where were those?

14:32.261 --> 14:34.444
But they were just, I mean it was mainstream.

14:34.744 --> 14:37.327
It wasn't a corner or an alcove.

14:37.347 --> 14:44.876
It was just like, well there's a chair and it might be right on that main kind of thoroughfare in there and I'd be there.

14:44.916 --> 14:50.322
If you went to the snack bar, did an upperclassman bother a fish in the snack bar?

14:51.484 --> 14:58.392
You know, I don't remember going, I knew who the snack bar was, but I wasn't a snack bar person.

14:58.878 --> 15:02.423
How much spending money did you have that freshman year?

15:02.443 --> 15:02.864
Interesting.

15:04.546 --> 15:08.732
When I came away to school, my dad gave me a checkbook.

15:10.775 --> 15:13.760
And I wrote all the checks that I wanted to write, open account.

15:14.961 --> 15:20.329
And I remember, oh, three or four years after I graduated, I said to my dad, I said, Dad, you know, you sent me away to school.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.566
with a checkbook and you never gave me spending limitations or whatever."

15:25.629 --> 15:29.717
I said, that was kind of unusual.

15:29.797 --> 15:30.819
Why did you do that?

15:31.100 --> 15:39.658
He said, son, all I had to do was look at those checks and I could tell exactly what you were doing, what you were spending your money on, because there was no credit cards in those days.

15:39.678 --> 15:41.862
And I guess I was more frugal

15:42.787 --> 15:45.493
because I was just frugal.

15:45.534 --> 15:53.232
I never have been a drinker, so I didn't spend money on beer.

15:53.593 --> 15:54.535
I remember we used to

15:55.763 --> 16:05.556
It seems like on Friday nights or Saturday nights, I remember groups all through the time I was going out for chicken fried steak and a movie.

16:06.717 --> 16:11.563
It seemed like chicken fried steak dinner was like a dollar fifteen or a dollar and a quarter and the movie was fifty cents.

16:12.825 --> 16:16.810
So I was spending money during the course of a week, I was probably about two dollars and fifty cents.

16:17.498 --> 16:25.026
Now that full semester, that first semester, did you and your buddies attempt any good bull?

16:25.186 --> 16:27.789
Did you attempt any pranks on anybody or anything?

16:31.653 --> 16:40.982
Yeah, I remember going to another dorm or two and taking lights.

16:42.244 --> 16:47.269
The hallways had screw-in light bulbs and if you sat on somebody's shoulder you could take

16:48.397 --> 16:49.519
take the light bulbs.

16:51.303 --> 16:57.435
But I think in our outfit something had gone wrong the previous year.

16:58.678 --> 17:08.397
Some upperclassmen had gotten in trouble and some people kicked out because there just wasn't the

17:09.929 --> 17:11.511
Maybe it was the quality of leadership.

17:11.531 --> 17:17.937
There just wasn't this desire to do stupid, silly things.

17:20.559 --> 17:30.029
Like when I get together with my classmates now and they talk about some of the things that went on in their outfits, and that just wasn't us.

17:31.710 --> 17:39.598
But then, I don't know, because my junior year

17:40.709 --> 17:44.672
The outfit I was in, I was a First Sergeant.

17:44.692 --> 18:04.089
With my knowledge, the freshman raided another dorm to include lighting off some tires that caused smoke and blew out windows, and I got our outfit disbanded.

18:05.250 --> 18:10.294
But it was more, it was one of those things that,

18:11.843 --> 18:13.085
that just kind of happened.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.687
As a First Sergeant, I knew about it.

18:14.707 --> 18:28.486
I remember sitting in a dorm with a buddy, sitting in our chairs with our feet propped up on the radiator, watching the freshmen go over there at 1 or 2 in the morning and watching it all happen and come apart.

18:28.506 --> 18:32.411
The next day, our outfit was history.

18:32.732 --> 18:35.475
I remember being on suspended suspension from school.

18:37.338 --> 18:41.023
I'm thankful to this day that I wasn't kicked out of school.

18:41.830 --> 18:51.360
but it was a tremendous lesson that I learned about the responsibility for your actions and the actions that you are in charge of.

18:52.841 --> 19:01.690
Our commanding officer, he was the CO, and I don't know if he knew about it or what, but he was removed as CO.

19:03.632 --> 19:10.960
It was like, as a first sergeant, I had an active hand in seeing that the rug got pulled out from under him, and he was

19:11.598 --> 19:12.840
Fine cadet and a good guy.

19:14.281 --> 19:18.426
Do you remember your first Corps trip?

19:19.007 --> 19:20.749
I remember the Corps trip.

19:21.130 --> 19:22.051
I don't know if it was the first one.

19:22.071 --> 19:22.812
It probably was.

19:22.872 --> 19:27.918
The first Corps trip that year, as best I can recall, was up to Fort Worth to play TCU.

19:29.660 --> 19:30.842
How did you get there?

19:30.982 --> 19:33.505
Well, I remember driving.

19:35.375 --> 19:44.144
I remember stopping in Mejia because driving by car with Mike Richardson who was at that first semester, was not my official lady, was a good buddy.

19:45.045 --> 19:53.554
I remember driving up with him and his brother had been in the Corps the year before, stopping at Mejia where they served fried pies.

19:53.654 --> 20:04.285
This was before the McDonald's became about and this was before the franchise and fried apple pies were the big thing and half the Corps was in the parking lot at this place in Mejia.

20:04.838 --> 20:07.182
getting a Dr. Pepper, I'm sure, and a fried pie.

20:07.222 --> 20:11.449
Then we drove on up to Dallas and stayed with his family.

20:12.611 --> 20:20.223
The next morning I remember getting over to Fort Worth bright and early to the form-up point and going to the game.

20:20.664 --> 20:25.632
I think the Aggies got outscored.

20:27.687 --> 20:37.960
And I don't remember the post-game party, although I'm sure there was one, but I remember the marching down the streets of Fort Worth and, you know, being proud and saluting.

20:38.020 --> 20:48.713
And I remember it was just one of these beautiful, not-a-cloud-in-the-sky days, and it was just, you know, I just thought this was just a great experience.

20:48.733 --> 20:52.918
Do you remember on all your Corps trips, do you remember any bad experiences?

20:54.653 --> 20:56.397
I sure haven't gotten many of those.

20:58.361 --> 21:00.045
Did the crowd ever boo or?

21:01.428 --> 21:12.493
No, there's all kind of people watching and all kind of people clapping and the band playing and, I mean, as you would expect for somebody that was thirty years career.

21:12.473 --> 21:13.214
military.

21:13.254 --> 21:19.961
I enjoyed wearing the uniform and I enjoyed the people clapping and the flags.

21:19.981 --> 21:27.149
It was just something that became, I guess, part and parcel of my makeup.

21:27.230 --> 21:28.731
I just enjoyed it.

21:29.512 --> 21:33.437
Do you remember going to Silver Taps as a freshman?

21:35.339 --> 21:40.084
Yeah, it was explained to us and I remember

21:42.173 --> 22:09.413
I guess there wasâ€”memory fades, but it seemed to me like me and my roommate were more concerned to make sure that no light got out of our room than we were to having profound thoughts about, you know, our own mortality and Aggie spirit and the things that you're supposed to think about or you shouldn't be thinking about when you go to the silver test.

22:09.663 --> 22:23.001
as I recall, more concerned about making sure there wasn't light getting out through underneath our door and, you know, out the window because we were told this is lights out and this is the way you show your respect for the Aggie who was killed.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.844
But everybody did take it seriously.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.546
Oh, absolutely.

22:26.987 --> 22:29.871
Describe Bonfire, your fish here.

22:30.832 --> 22:31.653
What did you all do?

22:31.794 --> 22:38.623
Well, I remember very well the participation in going out to Bonfire because I remember...

22:40.915 --> 22:46.544
Once again, to think that Bonfire was new and different, I didn't understand it.

22:46.664 --> 22:51.632
It becomes part of you once you've done it.

22:51.652 --> 23:04.052
But I remember early on a Saturday morning of getting on a flatbed truck up behind Duncan and with no sides on the flatbed truck.

23:04.853 --> 23:08.138
I remember that we all were sitting there and we all had to lock arms.

23:09.603 --> 23:12.333
That's the way that no one fell off.

23:13.678 --> 23:21.267
The freshmen, I think it was our privilege to sit on the outside and lock arms and all the other, the upperclassmen behind us.

23:21.432 --> 23:27.399
some bawdy songs being sung, some that I had never heard of before.

23:28.481 --> 23:33.927
But the spirit was, it was like, well, this is to go off and have a good time.

23:34.208 --> 23:35.709
How far away was the cutting area?

23:35.729 --> 23:36.170
Do you remember?

23:37.151 --> 23:41.516
It was maybe 10 or 12 miles.

23:42.598 --> 23:47.424
How many weeks did you all work on Bonfire your freshman year?

23:48.385 --> 23:51.068
You know, I only remember going out to the cut site

23:57.612 --> 24:00.115
two weekends is the most I can possibly remember.

24:00.295 --> 24:09.565
I remember Saturday, but it was an all-day thing on Saturday of cutting downâ€”I don't think I ever got the cut as a freshman, but carrying those logs out.

24:11.147 --> 24:21.578
It just seemed systematic, and it seemed good, and the upperclassmen were in control, and I don't remember anything

24:23.482 --> 24:26.649
I don't remember any hijinks or hazing.

24:26.810 --> 24:31.400
It was a good time and we were just working to get the bonfire built.

24:31.681 --> 24:42.064
See, what most people have said, just like you, that the time they spent was not very long in number of days or weeks.

24:43.040 --> 24:49.392
And the dimensions of Bonfire were not yet huge.

24:50.014 --> 24:51.056
Where was it located?

24:51.416 --> 24:56.506
Bonfire was right behind Duncan on the drill field and it was a teepee style.

24:58.310 --> 25:03.580
And my outfit was not involved in

25:04.657 --> 25:09.261
building, and was not involved working behind Duncan.

25:10.262 --> 25:13.946
I might have had a guard duty out there, but I don't remember it.

25:15.207 --> 25:18.830
Do you remember where the outhouse came from, by chance?

25:19.251 --> 25:19.551
No.

25:20.652 --> 25:31.322
Among the things I've learned, in the 20s at least, is that you lived in somewhere not too far away, and if you wanted a better outhouse at home than you had,

25:31.707 --> 25:36.368
You came and arranged for the Corps to come and steal yours.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.302
In other words, you knew they were going to do it.

25:38.862 --> 25:48.974
And then the campus administration then paid for your new outhouse so that you got rid of an old one and got a new one.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.957
And everybody was happy.

25:51.678 --> 25:51.978
Yeah.

25:52.038 --> 25:53.940
Probably better constructed than the one that you lost.

25:54.261 --> 25:54.681
That's right.

25:55.302 --> 25:56.764
That's right.

25:56.784 --> 25:57.124
Let's see.

25:57.284 --> 26:01.369
And they cut down with almost nothing but axes.

26:01.569 --> 26:02.170
Is that right?

26:02.757 --> 26:06.464
I don't remember any saws ever being out there.

26:06.484 --> 26:07.726
That's the same.

26:09.289 --> 26:09.770
Let's see.

26:11.233 --> 26:14.279
And the Texas game, was it here or there?

26:14.339 --> 26:14.960
Do you remember?

26:17.605 --> 26:23.196
The first year it was here, Kyle Field, because I remember

26:24.982 --> 26:30.189
I remember James Saxton was the All-American from TU and he was from Palestine.

26:30.630 --> 26:34.375
I remember it was a close game, or I think it was close.

26:34.395 --> 26:36.397
I remember it was a sunny day.

26:40.523 --> 26:44.188
Then the two games in Austin.

26:47.020 --> 26:54.049
I don't, we played our hearts out and they had much the better team, but we got outscored both times.

26:54.110 --> 27:14.597
And I remember the 63 game here when we had them, when they were, after the Kennedy assassination, and we had them down and going into the fourth quarter and our captain, John Brotherton, intercepted and was tackled trying to let all the ball back and, you know, all that's

27:15.438 --> 27:18.822
football history and I remember the missed call in the end zone by the referee.

27:18.842 --> 27:21.586
Of course I was a yell eater that year and I was down there close and saw it all.

27:23.929 --> 27:29.416
And had a, you know, and had a, like everybody did, all the Aggies there, had a heartbreaking experience.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.584
That freshman year you said there were some athletes in your outfit.

27:36.185 --> 27:41.091
Were you aware of any cush courses for athletes only?

27:41.847 --> 27:44.050
I haven't heard of any either.

27:44.651 --> 27:46.454
No, I don't, no, no.

27:48.938 --> 27:51.502
The, let's see, another freshman.

27:51.863 --> 27:55.348
Do you remember going to muster your freshman year?

27:58.173 --> 28:09.390
I'll tell you, the only memories I have is not specific years.

28:10.079 --> 28:17.731
but going to muster in front of what we call the Simpson's Administration Building, now called the Williams Building.

28:17.751 --> 28:26.164
I remember so crowded that I was way off to the right and couldn't see, couldn't hear, et cetera.

28:26.313 --> 28:30.557
And things gradually got moved.

28:31.098 --> 28:37.464
Okay, you did okay in grades your first semester at the end of the first year.

28:37.544 --> 28:40.727
What did you do at the end of that first academic year?

28:40.747 --> 28:41.628
What did you do that summer?

28:44.351 --> 28:53.020
Well, that summer, the second half of the summer, I went to Quantico, Virginia for Marine Corps training.

28:53.700 --> 28:55.442
The first half of the summer,

28:55.827 --> 29:10.646
I went home because my parents had moved from North Dakota to Billings, Montana, and I worked for my dad, delivering dynamite and also mixing ammonium nitrate and fuel oil.

29:10.866 --> 29:18.036
They were building a big dam up there, and he had the contract to supply the explosives to blow the rock out.

29:18.496 --> 29:23.843
It was on the Bighorn River in southeastern Montana.

29:23.823 --> 29:38.563
I'm saying, wow, over ammonium nitrate because I was a high school student in Orange, Texas, almost exactly 100 miles east of the Texas City explosion.

29:38.583 --> 29:39.164
And you remember?

29:39.364 --> 29:48.637
Which was a shipload of ammonium nitrate because the shock waves rattled the Venetian blinds in our Spanish class window 100 miles away.

29:49.539 --> 29:52.783
At Quantico,

29:53.270 --> 29:59.319
Did you feel that your Aggie year had helped you be ready for that?

30:00.841 --> 30:01.522
Oh, yeah.

30:01.822 --> 30:20.509
I've said many times that I felt like I had a head start in the Marine Corps and experience and level of confidence that was just uniquely Aggie.

30:21.485 --> 30:23.328
What was it like to be a sophomore?

30:25.050 --> 30:36.888
A sophomore, I was over and had switched outfits and went over to I-3, which was the new Navy Marine Corps unit that was formed because the Texas Maritime Academy had started and we had their freshmen.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.673
Fish year was over in the Duncan area.

30:40.873 --> 30:45.400
Sophomore year was over in the Cebisa area.

30:46.696 --> 31:12.872
the uh the people in the outfit were all all the upperclassmen were marine oriented so we were a homogeneous group so to speak but uh in retrospect we were also probably uh full of ourselves thinking that we were a little bit better than everybody else and it would eventually led to our demise uh in those days the rest of the corps was not into the pt and
