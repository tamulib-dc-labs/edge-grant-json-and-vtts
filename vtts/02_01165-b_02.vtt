WEBVTT

00:03.929 --> 00:10.599
Yeah, so I think that the planetary field has 
become better integrated with the rest of

00:03.929 --> 00:10.599
astronomy. And that's largely also because 
planetary studies have, thanks to the amount of

00:11.661 --> 00:24.460
money and effort, have been brought up to date. You 
have to realize that back in the 30s and 40s, when

00:24.480 --> 00:30.409
planetary studies were at their lowest ebb, The 
techniques that were used by planetary

00:31.199 --> 00:34.882
astronomers were very primitive. There was an 
awful lot of what was called physical study of

00:35.022 --> 00:49.655
planets, which was taking pictures of them and 
trying to understand things from just direct

00:35.022 --> 00:49.655
photographs, which is not very important and not 
very useful. With perhaps different filters?

00:50.796 --> 00:51.097
That's right. A lot of stuff like tracking dust 
storms on Mars. There's still a certain amount of

00:54.540 --> 01:00.565
tracking dust storms on Mars that goes on, but 
that's kind of all there was in those days. There

01:01.051 --> 01:07.577
were a few feeble efforts by people to understand 
the markings on them. You have to realize, when I

01:07.617 --> 01:14.423
got into this business, there was a huge 
controversy over the nature of the lunar craters.

01:14.583 --> 01:17.666
There were still people who wanted lunar craters 
and volcanoes. Kuiper was one of the first people

01:18.447 --> 01:29.337
who pointed out that lunar craters were different 
from lunar volcanoes and showed that these things

01:18.447 --> 01:29.337
that people would call them were genuine 
volcanoes like the volcanoes in Hawaii. and

01:29.873 --> 01:34.640
pointed that out as a result of compiling the 
pictures for the photographic data. And so there

01:35.462 --> 01:47.720
was a long period of techniques that were being 
used by mainline astronomers, particularly

01:35.462 --> 01:47.720
spectroscopy, simply weren't being applied to 
planets. And after planetary spectroscopy got

01:47.740 --> 01:58.817
revived, that quickly showed the need for more 
laboratory spectroscopy, more molecular

01:47.740 --> 01:58.817
things. molecular spectra have taken over an 
overriding importance in the Earth's atmosphere

01:59.135 --> 02:05.403
because of pollutant detection. So the portfolio 
has become, well, I guess that's the other

02:06.565 --> 02:23.808
connection, that the whole business of 
comparative planetology, of comparing both the

02:06.565 --> 02:23.808
solid bodies in the atmosphere of other planets 
with that of the Earth, has made the field a great

02:06.565 --> 02:23.808
deal more respectable as well as more 
well-funded. And so this has again brought a more

02:27.772 --> 02:33.402
into the mainstream of science and left a little 
peripheral interest. Where do you think if there

02:35.326 --> 02:41.577
was never been a NASA? Well, for there never to have 
been a NASA, there would never have had to be a

02:41.597 --> 02:46.185
Sputnik. And for there never to have been a 
Sputnik, I mean, this is really one of these things

02:50.266 --> 02:59.139
that's tied in with the current war and the use of 
ICBMs and rockets for military purposes. There's

02:59.679 --> 03:04.827
a whole broad context there that must be tied 
together. Do you think that if there had not been

03:05.107 --> 03:15.382
that,

03:05.107 --> 03:15.382
they seem willing to do it right now, this year? 
Yeah, right. Hmm.

03:20.945 --> 03:26.392
Well, the Air Force certainly was sponsoring a lot 
of early studies and things that could be done.

03:26.432 --> 03:36.626
Now, for instance, to give you some notion, again, 
of a Cold War tie-in, when I had, I guess I hadn't

03:26.432 --> 03:36.626
even gotten my Ph.D. yet. I was a senior graduate 
student at Harvard. I was asked by one of the

03:40.311 --> 03:48.201
companies around 128, I guess it was somebody out 
at Lincoln,

03:40.311 --> 03:48.201
who write a study of what could be done with a 
100-inch pulse depth of orbit. And this must have

03:54.166 --> 03:59.253
been around 1969 or 60. And, of course, 
unbeknownst to me at the time, the Earth Force was

04:01.536 --> 04:09.728
in the process of launching 100-inch telescopes 
in orbit, looking down rather than up. I was

04:10.589 --> 04:11.631
unaware of that. Right. I was unaware of that, of 
course. and was extremely skeptical at the time

04:15.974 --> 04:21.541
that the technology permitted such a thing to be 
done. They were talking about a lifetime for the

04:22.162 --> 04:30.892
telescope of two weeks to a month, and they wanted 
projects that could be done quickly in that length

04:22.162 --> 04:30.892
of time. I gave them a rather discouraging report 
because I thought that testing the optics of the

04:31.673 --> 04:43.568
thing would take more time than that, and that it 
wouldn't be possible to do an awful lot of

04:31.673 --> 04:43.568
astronomy with such an object. And, in fact, we've 
seen from the Hubble Space Telescope that, in

04:44.088 --> 04:52.761
fact, it takes several years to test and correct 
the optics that's up there. So maybe I wasn't so far

04:53.422 --> 04:55.364
off. Well, how long did it take them to correct the 
optics they needed to? About four to five years.

04:59.791 --> 05:00.752
Yes, it took a while. Of course, they weren't as 
well funded as some of these airport problems.

05:07.422 --> 05:09.505
Planetary astronomers now have their own 
journals. I would say

05:09.704 --> 05:20.903
they're good for both.

05:28.476 --> 05:34.446
The DPS was extremely valuable for planetary 
astronomy because you have to remember that that

05:34.915 --> 05:40.241
was a time when you couldn't get planetary papers 
published in the Apt.J. And so Icarus, like

05:41.141 --> 05:50.892
several other journals one could name, was formed 
as a place for people to publish who couldn't

05:41.141 --> 05:50.892
publish in the Apt.J.

05:53.454 --> 05:59.961
You remember Icarus was founded by Copal, who, I 
think, wrote Journey of Donorite. And Copal

06:00.616 --> 06:04.421
founded it. Yeah, right. And then it was taken over 
by Carl Sagan. And Carl, as soon as he took it over,

06:09.507 --> 06:18.878
tried to build it up and make it a focal point for 
planetary work, which he was entirely successful

06:09.507 --> 06:18.878
in doing. And concomitant with that, there was an 
effort by several people, of whom I believe Carl

06:20.099 --> 06:30.572
was one, to firm a society devoted to planetary 
studies. and to make Icarus the official journal

06:30.890 --> 06:33.934
of that society. The other people came about after 
a few years, and DPS members have had for a long time

06:34.875 --> 06:45.089
a good price break on Icarus subscriptions.

06:45.149 --> 06:52.158
You answered the question I had earlier, what was 
planetary astronomy like when you started, and

06:45.149 --> 06:52.158
now you didn't answer that. But do you think 
planetary astronomy is part of astronomy? Of

06:56.043 --> 06:58.106
course, yes. I always did. It seems it's a totally 
different character now. When you look at the view

07:02.287 --> 07:19.933
of the planets, in fact, even when I was still at 
Harvard, I realized that everything that was

07:02.287 --> 07:19.933
accepted proof of our planets in the old planetary 
astronomy days, there was something drastically

07:02.287 --> 07:19.933
wrong about every planet. Because when I started 
teaching astronomy, I taught my students that

07:19.953 --> 07:25.281
we're doing all these people and things all the 
time. that Venus rotates in 24 hours. Or 248. Take

07:30.302 --> 07:31.784
your pick, either one. And that the clouds were 
probably made of water. Then there was the blue

07:37.369 --> 07:39.892
haze on Mars.

07:42.395 --> 07:45.197
Jupiter, let's see, what was there about Jupiter? 
The red spot was all wrong. The red spot was all

07:47.640 --> 07:48.861
wrong, yeah. There was a Taylor column at that 
time.

07:55.315 --> 07:57.218
There was just so much stuff then. It was just 
awful. Yeah, right. In fact, if you want a good

08:02.905 --> 08:16.864
picture of that incorrect view of planetary 
astronomy, a good picture of the way it was, look at

08:02.905 --> 08:16.864
Blanco and McCaskey's book, The Basic Physics of 
the Solar System. Yeah, you'll also find that in

08:17.004 --> 08:19.347
Russell Dugan's story. That's right, yeah. But 
these two books together... really embody that

08:23.260 --> 08:37.143
view of the solar system before the old 
spacecraft, before modern technology was

08:23.260 --> 08:37.143
brought to bear on planetary problems, and shows 
you what a primitive state it was in. And I guess in a

08:37.845 --> 08:48.863
way, even though the stellar guys sneered at 
planetary stuff largely because of the

08:37.845 --> 08:48.863
sensationalism It was

08:49.248 --> 09:12.083
really the lack of applications of things like 
spectroscopy and large telescopes and even the

08:49.248 --> 09:12.083
existing technologies today. the planetary 
problems that made planetary astronomy so

09:12.367 --> 09:18.857
exceedingly permanent at that time? That was 
something I'm certainly going to stress, which is

09:18.877 --> 09:27.110
that some of these things could have been 
uncovered long before they were. Long before they

09:27.130 --> 09:28.032
were. Long before they were. Let's get personal 
for a minute. All right. What's the best piece of

09:33.561 --> 09:36.265
work you think you've ever done? You always have 
the feeling that the paper you're working on now is

09:37.612 --> 09:43.558
the finest thing in the world. I guess, in a way, the 
best piece of work I've done, apart from what I'm

09:44.780 --> 10:00.577
working on now, is a series of review articles I 
wrote for Nat Carlton's book on pathometry. I've

10:00.597 --> 10:04.581
got three chapters in Volume 12A of Methods of 
Experimental Physics. that was published in

10:05.236 --> 10:07.539
1975. And that's been a very influential and I 
would say successful review of the subject. A less

10:16.311 --> 10:27.065
successful but I think equally good piece of work 
is the body of work I did on simulations back in the

10:16.311 --> 10:27.065
late 60s and early 70s. Unfortunately, that has 
not been influential. Well, most astronomers are

10:31.207 --> 10:52.731
unaware of propagation through turbulence, 
modern simulation theory, ceiling, and all that

10:31.207 --> 10:52.731
stuff that's well understood by optical 
physicists, communication engineers,

10:31.207 --> 10:52.731
oceanographers, and many other people in fields 
dealing with propagation through turbulence.

10:52.751 --> 11:01.180
Astronomers, unfortunately, were the first 
people into this field of turbulent propagation,

10:52.751 --> 11:01.180
and they fossilized a lot of wrong notions very 
early. In particular, the notion that there are

11:01.531 --> 11:09.478
independent bright and dark factors argument can 
be used to estimate the amplitude of simulation.

11:10.619 --> 11:18.686
That argument was recently published last year, 
most recently published last year in solar

11:10.619 --> 11:18.686
physics, at least 30 years after it was known to be 
wrong. And I am continually discouraged at how to

11:20.167 --> 11:27.193
solve this problem of getting astronomers 
educated. The theory is not all that difficult,

11:27.213 --> 11:31.116
but it seems to be one we refuse to learn. because 
the textbooks are in other fields. It's the

11:34.059 --> 11:36.483
not-invented-here business. And they simply 
won't read books written by people who are not a

11:36.503 --> 11:40.910
scholar. Do you have any misfires? Misfires? You 
mean real boo-boos? Yes. Sentin bands. Sentin

11:47.820 --> 11:48.421
bands. I guess the biggest sentin band thing I came 
up with was when I suggested there might be carbon

11:48.481 --> 11:55.973
disulfide on Venus. And a close companion to that 
was my suggestion that the lower atmosphere of

11:56.560 --> 12:03.468
Venus might contain a large amount of sulfur. 
Those are probably my worst two pieces of work. Any

12:09.735 --> 12:20.466
gripes or compliments about the way the USA's 
handled science and, of course, scientific

12:09.735 --> 12:20.466
research grants in particular in the past? Yeah, 
let me think about this for a second. Turn off the

12:23.830 --> 12:24.491
tape. OK. I think NASA got off on the wrong foot by 
being created overnight in a rush. The result was

12:32.643 --> 12:35.648
it was staffed with people who were available. I 
know there were people who were borrowed from

12:36.669 --> 12:40.635
other agencies in the Washington area. There were 
a lot of non-astronomers put in. There were too few

12:43.379 --> 12:56.419
people at the start that had the scientific 
expertise to guide the agency

12:43.379 --> 12:56.419
wisely. That was the error in the beginning. After 
a few years, they began getting some scientists

12:59.229 --> 13:02.854
involved. Unfortunately, as the thing grew, it 
became more and more bureaucratic, and that

13:03.935 --> 13:25.005
repelled more and more scientists, so that now 
it's exceedingly difficult to get anybody with

13:03.935 --> 13:25.005
good scientific credentials to help NASA 
headquarters, or for that matter, any other of

13:03.935 --> 13:25.005
these Washington bureaucracies. And again, the 
result is that there's not enough scientific

13:25.525 --> 13:33.254
input to the policy making.

13:40.622 --> 13:54.638
There's entirely too much bureaucracy that has 
been shoveled onto the individual scientists,

13:40.622 --> 13:54.638
the grant receivers, who have worked through the 
development of these large research

13:55.107 --> 13:59.854
contract-handling organizations that are 
connected with universities. The result is that

14:01.255 --> 14:06.683
far too much money is going in the overhead and not 
enough in the science. That's another problem.

14:11.890 --> 14:24.928
There's yet another problem in NASA, which I have 
seen close up, and that is that although they have

14:11.890 --> 14:24.928
continually patted themselves on the back for 
their amount of general expertise I've actually

14:25.010 --> 14:34.200
heard NASA people say that NASA's greatest 
contribution was learning how to manage these

14:25.010 --> 14:34.200
enormously complicated technical projects. In 
fact, they have not learned how to manage these

14:35.322 --> 14:40.588
enormously complicated technical projects. 
Every one of them that I've seen has been done

14:40.608 --> 14:43.070
differently. They always discover that there 
were serious flaws in the previous project, so

14:43.491 --> 14:53.262
they vow to do the next one differently, and they 
make a whole new set of mistakes the second time

14:43.491 --> 14:53.262
around. My favorite example of horror story is the 
thing that got me out of the Viking lander camera

14:53.697 --> 15:01.065
team. I was going to these meetings every two weeks 
in various parts of the country to discuss

15:02.066 --> 15:09.514
progress on the cameras. And at one of these 
meetings, a guy came up to me and said, hey, we got a

15:10.315 --> 15:13.999
problem. We've just realized that the radio 
transmitter that sits on the back of the lander is

15:15.400 --> 15:22.388
gold coated for thermal control. And we're 
worried that the sun will reflect off of this shiny

15:23.633 --> 15:30.980
gold coating into the camera, and the camera will 
be blinded. And I said, come on. That's a

15:33.742 --> 15:35.604
ridiculous worry. The sun would have to be just in 
the right orientation, just the right height

15:35.624 --> 15:40.068
above the horizon. Even if the sun did reflect off 
of the thing into the camera, it's a scanning

15:40.568 --> 15:45.073
system. The image of the sun is only going to be on 
the detector for a tenth of a millisecond. You can

15:48.816 --> 15:49.997
forget about it. You know, it's a solid state 
detector. You can't hurt it. He said, you mean we

15:53.637 --> 15:55.660
don't have to paint it brown? And I said, that's 
right. And he said, you've just saved us $30,000.

16:00.386 --> 16:07.255
And it turned out that the $30,000 was not $30,000 
worth of brown paint. And it was not $30,000 worth

16:07.275 --> 16:11.241
of testing in thermal vacuum chamber. It was 
$30,000 that it cost to print and mail out that

16:11.821 --> 16:22.716
boiler plate thing two inches thick every time 
they made a change in the specification. So if they

16:22.848 --> 16:31.878
changed the line from shall be gold-coated to 
shall be painted brown, that was $30,000 down the

16:22.848 --> 16:31.878
drain. That kind of was the last straw for me.

16:36.983 --> 16:40.467
All

16:36.983 --> 16:40.467
right. We've done a lot of work from the ground and 
from spacecraft, and no trace of life or anything

16:40.487 --> 16:52.080
approaching it anywhere else in the solar system 
except Earth. Yep. How much do you think this has

16:52.767 --> 16:56.993
hurt funding? A lot? None at all? Gee, I don't know 
if it's made any difference or not. Unless

17:07.166 --> 17:10.450
walking, talking life were discovered 
somewhere. You know, if, for example, the lichens

17:10.630 --> 17:17.880
that had been expected on Mars by some people had 
actually been discovered on Mars. I don't think

17:18.620 --> 17:21.263
that would have done much. You've got to realize 
that there's something like 10% of the population

17:21.283 --> 17:26.829
that thinks the moon landings were fake. They 
don't believe any of this stuff anyway. People in

17:29.391 --> 17:37.700
general are pretty ignorant of science, 
apparently increasingly more so as time goes on.

17:38.882 --> 17:46.770
And I think that unless obviously intelligent 
life that could compete with us on our own level had

17:38.882 --> 17:46.770
been discovered, I don't think it would have made 
any ripple in the public. It would have made a

17:50.847 --> 17:53.952
ripple in the academic community, to be sure. But 
I'm not sure that it would have had a big impact on

17:54.453 --> 18:01.904
funding of NASA. You have to realize there might 
also have been a backlash from the

18:02.224 --> 18:11.157
fundamentalists against this and demanding that 
this kind of stuff be shut off. So I think, on

18:11.438 --> 18:16.285
average, it probably made no difference 
whatsoever. What's the state of planetary

18:16.771 --> 18:19.976
astronomy today? Oh, shrinking like mad. 
Shrinking like mad. The NASA budget is rapidly

18:25.123 --> 18:27.166
being cut. I read not long ago that 70% of the 
astronomers in this country, not just planetary,

18:28.088 --> 18:36.660
but all astronomers in this country are supported 
by NASA. It's creating an employment crisis. I

18:38.928 --> 18:49.157
think what's going to happen is that NASA will 
shrink back to something closely resembling the

18:38.928 --> 18:49.157
old NACA that preceded it, the National Advisory 
Committee on Aeronautics. I think it will become

18:49.177 --> 19:08.395
an aeronautical engineering research 
organization, as it was originally, and that the

18:49.177 --> 19:08.395
space business will eventually peter out and come 
to an end, either for lack of funding or because the

18:49.177 --> 19:08.395
accumulation of debris in orbit makes it 
impractical to launch things into space. into

19:08.830 --> 19:11.073
lower Earth orbit anymore. The Air Force seems 
ready, willing, and able to do space exploration.

19:16.340 --> 19:18.402
Do you think they'll make the change that they can 
stand on? They already are, of course. Well, I

19:21.466 --> 19:22.287
don't know. I think I'm not plugged into that 
community, so I can't say how eager they are to get

19:22.307 --> 19:28.576
into that kind of stuff. They may pick up a little of 
it. I can't... You see, the Air Force, probably

19:31.159 --> 19:37.487
even more than NASA, is interested in flying 
people around. I think even more than NASA, they

19:38.210 --> 19:44.255
regard that as their primary mission. And so I 
think it's unlikely that the Air Force will make it

19:44.275 --> 19:51.222
go in place of NASA. If the Air Force should take on 
the scientific one, as they did before there was

19:51.242 --> 20:00.190
NASA, would that be good or bad or a different 
performance? Well, it would be kind of like it was

20:00.210 --> 20:02.812
before there was a NASA. It would be things more 
oriented toward the Air Force's end than toward

20:02.992 --> 20:08.217
astronomers' end. It would be better than nothing 
from a scientific point of view. But again, it

20:13.839 --> 20:23.332
would be regarded as kind of marginal funding that 
a lot of people wouldn't be all that interested in

20:13.839 --> 20:23.332
because the airport has its own access to guns. 
There was this interesting business recently a

20:23.632 --> 20:30.502
few years ago when the airport declassified their 
active optics research. And it appears to me that

20:31.723 --> 20:38.052
the reason they did that was that... You can just 
barely make active optics work on astronomical

20:38.673 --> 20:45.705
objects, which are moving across the sky very 
slowly. But if you're trying to track incoming

20:46.286 --> 20:56.264
missiles or satellites or airplanes and correct 
their images, they have much higher angular rates

20:46.286 --> 20:56.264
of motion across the sky. The problem is very much 
more difficult. And I think the Air Force has

20:59.950 --> 21:03.837
probably given up on trying to do it for their 
purposes. and turn it over to the astronomers

21:04.222 --> 21:13.482
because they realized it would do us some good and 
it can't do the competition any good because it

21:04.222 --> 21:13.482
isn't useful for military use. And get them some 
good, favorable publicity. The problem is that

21:16.128 --> 21:19.615
the hardware is still at Air Force prices if you 
need a hundred and some actuators per mirror and

21:19.932 --> 21:44.269
the actuators cost fifty thousand dollars a piece 
i think the number of observatories that can

21:19.932 --> 21:44.269
afford that is about two one of which is eso and i 
don't know which is the other but maybe the cat

21:19.932 --> 21:44.269
maybe the cat right maybe the cat um

21:48.755 --> 21:50.177
That's a good question. I guess I would have to say 
from the current state of funding that they

21:51.278 --> 22:00.790
haven't done a good job of selling themselves to 
the Congress. From the response I get from people

22:00.810 --> 22:16.570
in the street and the interest I see in solar system 
astronomy in general when I talk to people, I think

22:00.810 --> 22:16.570
they've done a fair job of selling themselves to 
the public. But the public hasn't been

22:18.742 --> 22:25.528
sufficiently enthusiastic to communicate their 
interest to their representatives in Congress.

22:26.489 --> 22:35.638
As a result, planetary astronomy has remained 
near the bottom of Congress's priority list and is

22:26.489 --> 22:35.638
rapidly getting cut. Well, that almost 
completely answers the next question, which is,

22:35.958 --> 22:44.706
do you think that planetary astronomy has changed 
in any significant way the way the public thinks

22:35.958 --> 22:44.706
and views the research? Oh, yes. Absolutely. 
Absolutely. I think the thing more than anything

22:46.771 --> 23:01.609
else that has changed the public perception of 
things is the photographs, alas, not by planetary

22:46.771 --> 23:01.609
astronomers, but by NASA astronauts on the moon, 
photographs of the Earth as taken from the moon.

23:01.629 --> 23:06.675
That picture of Earthrise on the moon, I think, has 
really sunk in on the public consciousness. And in

23:06.775 --> 23:14.044
general, photographs of the Earth from space 
have, I think, heavily leaned under the

23:14.513 --> 23:20.380
environmental movement and the awareness that 
the Earth's resources are finite. Yeah, I think

23:20.400 --> 23:23.804
that's been a very beneficial effect. Not 
entirely on the part of planetary astronomers,

23:23.824 --> 23:27.068
but we've helped a little. There's a few technical 
questions. All right. Whatever happened to the

23:31.733 --> 23:33.655
blue haze and the blue blurry? That's a very 
interesting question. DeVolkalor and I wrote a

23:36.218 --> 23:43.727
paper that was never published on that very 
subject while I was still at Harvard. IAU

23:44.197 --> 23:49.084
symposium that was held in Marfa, Texas. We again 
presented this paper. The glitch in this was

23:52.128 --> 24:07.690
originally that one of the snipers was still alive 
at Lowell, and the book lure had used the sliper

23:52.128 --> 24:07.690
plates in gathering his raw material.

24:08.632 --> 24:20.067
The original idea behind the Blue Haze, that there 
was a large amount of opacity on Mars, was

24:08.632 --> 24:20.067
certainly disproved by the Mariner probes. In 
fact, that was one of the things that got me in

24:20.748 --> 24:28.699
trouble with JPL administration, was that Brad 
Smith and I sent a letter to science. Actually, I

24:28.719 --> 24:34.707
signed the letter with Brad, and Brad was the guy 
who mailed it in, unbeknownst to me. uh sonnet to

24:35.378 --> 25:05.318
science showing stating that the third 
observations of craters and shadows on mars by

24:35.378 --> 25:05.318
mariner six and seven showed that there was no 
large opacity at short wavelengths in these blue

24:35.378 --> 25:05.318
photo pictures i then got chewed out by my boss at 
jpl for not having this letter approved for

24:35.378 --> 25:05.318
publication by jpl security who was the owner must 
have been jerry smith i think at that time Well,

25:05.956 --> 25:14.305
he's immortal in the Keck Telescope because he's 
the chief engineer on the Keck Telescope. I think

25:14.325 --> 25:16.427
it's the same Jerry Smith. Anyway, I got chewed out 
for not having it cleared, and they insisted that I

25:16.447 --> 25:29.922
sign, after the fact, a clearance application 
form to have that letter approved for

25:16.447 --> 25:29.922
publication.

25:30.543 --> 25:48.485
Well, anyhow, so we know there's no blue haze, but 
the odd thing is, and this is what the local study of

25:30.543 --> 25:48.485
those old plates showed, there is an enhancement 
of contrastive features that appears to be

25:30.543 --> 25:48.485
statistically significant at small phase 
angles. In the sense that in blue photographs,

25:49.046 --> 25:59.959
things that seem to be well-known surface 
features appear more often at small phase angles

25:49.046 --> 25:59.959
than at large phase angles. And this is an effect 
which is only weakly dependent on seeing and image

26:00.243 --> 26:05.930
quality. And so it's not just due to the image being 
bigger near opposition. It's a genuine

26:10.696 --> 26:13.260
enhancement of contrast. I suppose it has to do 
with the difference in phase function between

26:13.280 --> 26:18.186
light areas and dark areas. But it's still an 
enigma as to why there is this enhancement in

26:19.468 --> 26:26.657
contrast at small phase. We still never published 
our paper. Although it's plainly visible in

26:29.605 --> 26:43.693
Schleifer's book on Mars, if you remember the big 
coffee table book that Schleifer produced with, I

26:29.605 --> 26:43.693
believe, Air Force funding, he shows essentially 
the same kind of figure that we came up with. All

26:43.874 --> 26:49.926
DeVos Miller did was reconfirm that same thing 
with more statistics and more data. I think the

26:50.378 --> 26:56.807
effect is real if there's an enhancement of 
contrast in blue photographs at small phase

26:50.378 --> 26:56.807
angles. So that's the blue clearing? That's the 
so-called blue clearing, but it's not a blue

26:58.188 --> 27:01.012
clearing. It's a blue contrast change at small 
phase angles. Whatever happened to the wave of

27:04.757 --> 27:06.480
darkening? Well, there have been various studies 
of the wave of darkening. I think Chick Capon

27:12.488 --> 27:16.253
published a number of papers on it. Who was that guy 
at Lowell? Len... I just didn't keep

27:20.534 --> 27:37.238
track of that stuff, Ron. I

27:38.139 --> 27:44.809
can't tell you whatever became of that. Here's 
something that you kept up with. What is the color

27:49.171 --> 27:51.555
of Mars? There's a book called The Red and Green 
Planet. I'll tell you, there's another book,

27:53.778 --> 28:00.228
which if you want to see the color of Mars, shows you 
pretty damn accurately the color of Mars. And

28:00.248 --> 28:09.521
that's a nice coffee table book that was put out as a 
NASA SP by Tim Mutch and the Viking Lander imaging

28:00.248 --> 28:09.521
team. And there are some well-reproduced color 
pictures in there showing the best

28:09.541 --> 28:17.794
reconstructions I know of of the color of Mars. 
They... It was the only spacecraft experiment on

28:18.753 --> 28:24.120
which genuine colorimetry was done. They 
determined the Munsell specifications for

28:24.140 --> 28:32.892
various features in the landscape, rocks, soil, 
sky, and whatnot. And that stuff was published in

28:32.912 --> 28:44.187
detail in JGR and then was published in a more 
informal fashion without the Munsell

28:32.912 --> 28:44.187
specifications. in this caucus table book called 
The Martian Landscape. And if you want to see what

28:49.107 --> 28:54.233
color Mars is, it's well shown in The Martian 
Landscape. If you look up the MUNCEL

28:54.253 --> 29:05.527
specifications and find out the names that the 
National Bureau of Standards attached to those

28:54.253 --> 29:05.527
colors, they are yellowish brown, various kinds 
of yellowish brown. It's about the color of an old

29:05.547 --> 29:07.429
rusty nail. So the brighter is on Mars, the darker 
is on Mars. Brighter, darker. Yellowish brown.

29:14.542 --> 29:19.768
Exactly.

29:19.848 --> 29:22.011
Whatever happened to the ashen light on Venus? Are 
you familiar with that? Yeah, the ashen light.

29:23.813 --> 29:35.607
Well, there's a curious follow-up to the ashen 
light, you see, and that's this infrared ashen

29:23.813 --> 29:35.607
light that has been discovered by David Allen and 
investigated further by David Crisp. The thermal

29:35.727 --> 29:42.675
radiation from the lower atmosphere that leaks 
out through the windows between the water and CO2

29:35.727 --> 29:42.675
bands. There is genuine radiation. It probably is 
not visible. Probably all the stuff that was

29:47.967 --> 29:55.143
reported as ashen light by the visual observer is 
purely optical illusion effect. But there is this

29:56.085 --> 30:02.959
funny successor to the ashen light in the near 
infrared that's genuine and has been studied.
