WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:04.121
That's one of those things that the military 
shouldn't get into. You mean it was too political?

00:09.849 --> 00:10.630
Too political? Yes. I'll illustrate that. I knew a 
good many Britishers, I guess, if you gather, and I

00:13.254 --> 00:23.088
knew what their point of view about it was, and that 
was expressed by their government to Truman

00:13.254 --> 00:23.088
directly. No part of it. They'd part company with 
us if they did it. Of course, I knew that people

00:30.085 --> 00:41.881
thought that it would lead Russia into war, and us 
into war with Russia, and I knew the pros and cons of

00:30.085 --> 00:41.881
that, but these are not questions which military 
people should address themselves to. What did you

00:42.983 --> 00:45.066
think of Truman's firing MacArthur? He had to. He 
had no option. He had to. MacArthur stepped over

00:50.614 --> 00:52.977
that line I was talking about. Yeah. Now, when were 
you assigned to the headquarters of Europe? as

00:59.667 --> 01:01.930
commander of the light bomber wing in France. 
Well, I served in Europe headquarters before

01:01.950 --> 01:07.759
that. I was assigned there to help arrange to get 
what we now call tactical weapons into position

01:07.779 --> 01:17.073
and so forth and so forth. And the opportunity came 
to get out of that headquarters into an active unit

01:18.295 --> 01:23.542
and I grabbed it. And when was this, early 1950s? I 
guess so. Wait a minute, wasn't it 51? I came back in

01:30.565 --> 01:33.488
54, so it had to be 51. Okay, so you were commander of 
the light bomber wing in France from 1951 to 1954?

01:38.032 --> 01:54.447
Look,

01:38.032 --> 01:54.447
I spent six months roughly in Europe, I mean Europe 
headquarters, and two and a half years roughly in

01:38.032 --> 01:54.447
France. So it had whatever that adds up to. Was it at 
this time when you were promoted to a Brigadier

01:57.351 --> 02:00.795
General? No, I wasn't promoted until I came home.

02:07.202 --> 02:10.907
And about how large was the command? It was a bomb 
wing. It was the only one of its kind in NATO, but it

02:13.770 --> 02:23.742
was a pleasure, particularly because of the It got 
me away from these things that I'm not too talented

02:24.515 --> 02:33.948
at anyway, away from the opposing forces and so on 
that I mentioned earlier. At this time France of

02:34.429 --> 02:42.901
course was still in NATO and later on by 61 they were 
taken out of NATO. How were the relations between

02:42.921 --> 02:49.851
the French and the Americans and the military? Oh 
I'd say good.

02:55.649 --> 02:59.055
It depended on where you were dealing. The 
relations at the highest level were not very good

02:59.916 --> 03:07.149
because it was totally political. The relations 
that I had with my counterparts in the French Air

03:09.332 --> 03:16.304
Force and the French Army were very good. In fact, 
they were amicable. I entertained them at my base

03:18.920 --> 03:25.432
in a goddamn lousy tent camp and they entertained 
me in their chateau. But we were good friends and we

03:26.634 --> 03:32.364
got along well and both of us got something out of 
it. But the relationships in the parish was

03:32.384 --> 03:41.400
something else because they were motivated a 
different way. Now in this time when you were in

03:41.819 --> 03:57.255
France, the United States was trying to 
rejuvenate West Germany and they eventually

03:41.819 --> 03:57.255
joined NATO too and we re-armed or helped re-arm 
West Germany. What was your opinion of re-arming

03:59.037 --> 04:02.680
West Germany? My opinion was we better goddamn 
well do it if we wanted to defend Europe on that part

04:04.342 --> 04:10.909
of it. Of course. But you see, at the time we're 
fixed on here, that geography of France was a

04:13.291 --> 04:24.963
backdrop. Now it's denied us.

04:30.529 --> 04:33.852
But that's no reason to talk about that. See, I went 
back to NATO after the next assignment and got

04:34.253 --> 04:41.560
another slant at it.

04:45.860 --> 04:50.787
NATO is never going to be out of trouble. I read the 
papers and almost every year there will be

04:50.807 --> 05:00.122
something about the drift in NATO or the schisms in 
NATO. That's always the case and it always will be

05:00.542 --> 05:03.447
the case. If you want to ask me whether or not I think 
the United States puts too much into it, as of right

05:04.829 --> 05:10.758
now I don't know. When I was there we did put too much 
into it. I mean by that we put more into it than we had

05:16.555 --> 05:24.764
to and it was extremely expensive.

05:29.729 --> 05:34.293
Now you left the command of the light bomber wing. 
This was your first wing command wasn't it? Well I

05:42.602 --> 05:45.465
guess

05:46.610 --> 05:50.436
This is the first tactical command I've had, yes. 
How did you like that? How did you like it? Did you

05:53.521 --> 05:55.283
enjoy being a commander? Of course I did. As a 
matter of fact, the goddamn outfit still has

05:58.769 --> 06:01.954
reunions. I had one not long ago. And I will say 
this, see I remember one way in this Goddamn sit

06:13.002 --> 06:16.106
around and tell the goddamn this lies. They'll all 
act like now like they just had a wonderfully good

06:16.627 --> 06:20.272
time. Well, Christ, it wasn't all that. They were 
in the mud a lot. And God knows their wives didn't

06:27.222 --> 06:29.505
enjoy it. My wife joined me there later. And she 
hated every day of it. But those guys seemed to

06:34.772 --> 06:38.557
think that was a great experience. I didn't worry 
at all. See, we went everywhere. Being the only one

06:43.276 --> 06:49.205
of our kind, we went all the way from Norway down to 
Saudi Arabia. This had its disadvantages, but

06:49.465 --> 06:54.373
also for a flying machine type, it was pretty good. 
And we'd go down to North Africa and bomb up the

06:55.214 --> 07:01.664
ranges and so forth.

07:04.368 --> 07:10.076
I made myself very unpleasant and disliked, of 
course. That's common for me. because my guys had

07:12.301 --> 07:21.433
to carry around a handbag full of different kinds 
of currencies and stupid bastards over in Germany

07:12.301 --> 07:21.433
that never went anywhere. They kept us on a funny 
money deal. For quite a script-type money, you

07:25.979 --> 07:35.892
don't think you could buy a meal in Italy with it or 
anywhere else for that matter, except right on a

07:25.979 --> 07:35.892
base. But it was hell's own job trying to get it 
through their heads that They were the pain in the

07:41.343 --> 07:45.587
ass to us who had to move all the way across the 
theater. The fighter outfits didn't. See, they

07:48.110 --> 07:50.873
always came back to the home base right there. And 
that was just one of the things that made me persona

07:50.953 --> 07:58.180
non grata, I guess. But altogether, and as far as 
the experience, working with the Americans and

08:00.222 --> 08:09.291
with the French, it was good. Do you think that your 
duty as the commander of that wing was one of the

08:10.300 --> 08:20.874
main reasons why you were promoted to 
generalship? I don't know. I

08:21.455 --> 08:28.744
want to make another philosophical statement 
about this.

08:32.789 --> 08:37.776
When you're in the military, if you know how the 
system works, and I did, Look, I've been in it a long

08:38.600 --> 08:40.282
time.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.129
You don't bother about things like that. The thing 
is, you've got one person to answer to, and that's

08:46.430 --> 08:51.657
yourself. If you feel like you're doing all right 
and you're doing what's right, that's what

08:52.438 --> 08:58.306
counts. And if you get promoted, fine. You don't 
bother with it too much. Unfortunately, most

09:08.080 --> 09:10.962
people aren't made that way. They think there's 
something wrong with them. And that's very

09:14.345 --> 09:15.746
painful. But I never bothered about that. I knew 
how the system worked. Now, you went back to the

09:24.394 --> 09:30.679
United States as deputy for personnel tactical 
air command. Was that a Pentagon job? Oh, no. No, it

09:33.381 --> 09:35.383
was headquartered then at Langley. Okay, at 
Langley. I want to make one more statement about

09:38.472 --> 09:40.795
this. By the time I was promoted to general, God 
knows, there must have been probably 150 at least

09:41.256 --> 09:52.029
men who had been junior to me who were promoted 
before me. But by the time I was promoted the second

09:53.271 --> 10:04.125
time, I was probably promoted over 300 men who were 
senior to me. Did I make it clear why this thing

10:05.219 --> 10:10.306
doesn't make so goddamn much difference as most 
people seem to think it does? Okay.

10:17.475 --> 10:26.226
Now at Langley, or during, this is, your next 
assignment then was from about 1954 to about 1957,

10:17.475 --> 10:26.226
probably. Four to 58, I believe it was. Okay, to 
1958. Wait a minute, was it four years? Must have

10:32.735 --> 10:34.517
been, that's what it was. Now as it was during this 
time that the Strategic Air Command of course was

10:36.050 --> 10:45.907
glamorized in America. There's even movies about 
it and Curtis LeMay was the leader And I've heard

10:52.452 --> 11:01.385
from other Air Force officers that there was some 
contention between tactical and the strategic

10:52.452 --> 11:01.385
air commands. Would you like to address that? Some 
what? There were some problems. There was some

11:04.870 --> 11:06.352
irritants. Oh, yes. There was friction. Yes, of 
course there was. Would you? Well, I'll

11:10.738 --> 11:12.340
illustrate it this way. Back when I was in the 
training command in the same job,

11:13.482 --> 11:22.054
that time when The Air Force was going to make a big 
program change, or change of any consequence.

11:28.487 --> 11:42.509
They called in senior officers, various 
commands, and we were called in to look at the plan

11:28.487 --> 11:42.509
under which the Strategic Air Command was going to 
be established and run. Two men in the conference,

11:44.132 --> 11:48.058
myself and one more, said this is probably going to 
be a bomb idea. But it may not be. But one thing you

11:55.994 --> 12:05.449
can be sure of, and that is you're going to 
establish an Air Force within the Air Force,

11:55.994 --> 12:05.449
separate and distinct. And that is going to cause 
you some problems. And we went on back and exactly

12:10.417 --> 12:14.944
set up that way. And what we said and how we did, 
Whether it's justified or not, I'm not in a

12:17.654 --> 12:20.797
position to judge. All I'm saying is that, yes, 
there were problems. And when I got back to TAC, we

12:23.020 --> 12:27.405
inherited them. It made for a situation in which 
you found yourself necessarily in competition

12:28.526 --> 12:43.763
with someone that you should not compete with.

12:44.784 --> 12:46.446
That's still true. You knew Curtis LeMay for a 
number of years before this time. We were

12:51.286 --> 12:54.609
classmates in the flight school. What did you 
think of him? Probably the best air commander or

12:58.973 --> 13:03.156
combat situation we've ever had. Not necessarily 
the attack. There were two others that were just as

13:05.919 --> 13:07.580
good. Who were they? Pat Partridge and Opie

13:10.603 --> 13:17.108
Weiler. LeMay was an extremely competent man. 
Now, let me talk about it just a moment since you

13:23.581 --> 13:28.126
asked the question. Way back when we were young in 
the service, each of us had to qualify as a radio

13:28.907 --> 13:42.101
operator, as a navigator, as an observer, as a 
gunner, as a pilot. Of course, all of us were

13:42.121 --> 13:43.483
pilots. When LeMay set out to do these things, he 
set out to be the best, to be the best radio

13:44.982 --> 13:55.558
operator, to be the best navigator, to be the best 
man with a gun and all that sort of thing. And he

13:56.299 --> 13:59.724
pretty goddamn well achieved that. I'll go one 
step further to illustrate what I mean. When I

14:03.250 --> 14:09.960
checked in his headquarters before I joined the 
group which I flew with, and fact-stated his

14:11.493 --> 14:14.998
headquarters there, so just to get the pitch. When 
a first, a mission came in for debriefing, he was

14:16.820 --> 14:40.572
then what they called a wing commander, later 
called it a division, now they call it an air force,

14:16.820 --> 14:40.572
but when they came in, you do a debriefing, you get 
the story from, here's the lead pilot, here's the

14:16.820 --> 14:40.572
lead navigator, here's the gunner, here's the, 
and so forth. Now, it was self-evident in the

14:42.340 --> 14:51.873
briefing that LeMay knew more about what these 
people were doing than they knew themselves.

14:53.796 --> 14:54.737
That's pretty impressive. He wasn't earnest 
about it. It was just self-evident to anybody that

14:58.502 --> 15:08.736
knew anything about how you run a show like that.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.199
He's pretty good. He's got some god awful blind 
spots, but who doesn't? He's good. What did you

15:18.866 --> 15:20.788
think his blind spots were? One of them, and this 
applies more earlier than it did later, but it

15:23.491 --> 15:33.022
applied at the time he took over the Air Force. He 
wasn't

15:39.209 --> 15:49.239
I don't know whether the right word is sensitive or 
whether he just planned to give it down, about the

15:39.209 --> 15:49.239
fact that people aren't all alike and they never 
will be. He was pretty severe to some people that

15:49.259 --> 15:59.789
had a lot to contribute. That's what I would call 
his mind spot, his principal one. He mellowed in

16:03.914 --> 16:07.377
his later years, he mellowed quite a lot. In fact, 
I'm reminded of a man who I knew pretty well that had

16:08.183 --> 16:21.981
gone to a commander's conference down in the 
Caribbean not too long after LeMay took over. And

16:22.001 --> 16:24.263
he came back just like that. God damn, I don't 
understand it. He said, I used to be scared of that

16:26.747 --> 16:31.092
son of a bitch that I'd run and leave the room to 
avoid him. He's just as kind and gentle as he can be.

16:37.512 --> 16:39.735
The fact of the matter was, LeMay got what he 
wanted. He didn't have to be that way anymore. He's

16:42.458 --> 16:47.584
a good guy, and God knows, you don't find many like 
him.

16:52.190 --> 16:58.478
I don't know anything about him now, I haven't seen 
him in years, but I suspect he's probably not in

16:52.190 --> 16:58.478
very good health. Now the Tactical Air Command, 
was your mission training?

17:09.912 --> 17:11.354
Well, not really. Not just that. Basically, in 
peacetime, that is your mission. So I can't say,

17:17.883 --> 17:20.187
no, it wasn't. Of course it is. But we had to build up 
units. We had to deploy them. We had

17:26.896 --> 17:33.065
what they now call this rapid deployment force. 
It's been in being a long time. I don't know why the

17:34.667 --> 17:38.653
newspapers say it's brand new, but it isn't. We had 
to get all this done, and then when the Air Force

17:39.730 --> 17:51.183
budget got cut, we had to cut it all back and 
readjust and all that. I'm talking about the

17:51.203 --> 17:54.246
headquarters job. And all the time, at least my 
job, was to see to it that the right people were in

17:54.267 --> 18:00.293
the right place. It's rewarding, particularly By 
that time, you see, I knew a hell of a lot of people. I

18:13.222 --> 18:20.675
knew something about anybody, any colonel, for 
example, who might be coming into the command or

18:13.222 --> 18:20.675
leaving it. If I didn't know him personally, I knew 
something about him. And it's useful to even... if

18:31.267 --> 18:36.252
necessary, to bend the rules a little bit to see to 
it that the right guy gets in the right place.

18:37.193 --> 18:39.335
Everybody benefits, you know, when this happens. 
He does, and the unit does, everybody does. And

18:42.599 --> 18:46.543
when you get the wrong guy, so much for that. It's a 
good type of job. Okay. Now your last job, you were

18:49.646 --> 18:54.191
assigned as Chief of Staff of the Allied Air Force 
in Southern Europe. And so that was from 1958 to

18:55.152 --> 18:57.294
1961. At this time you were a two-star general? 
Now,

19:01.675 --> 19:08.145
were relations with the French starting to sour? 
You must have dealt quite a bit with NATO and the

19:08.386 --> 19:14.335
French.

19:14.355 --> 19:19.363
Oh,

19:14.355 --> 19:19.363
the French kind of got on me for what it did for them, 
I guess they liked me all right. Did I hear your

19:24.244 --> 19:25.505
question? I don't know what you, I'm not sure. Were 
relations between, during these last three years

19:27.247 --> 19:38.059
from 58 to 61, were relations between the American 
Air Force and the French Air Force starting to

19:27.247 --> 19:38.059
sour? That wasn't the way of it. Oh, okay. About the 
time I got back there, I mean got back to NATO, mind

19:42.644 --> 19:49.671
you I'd had to go back and forth God knows how many 
times I've been in Europe while I was stationed at

19:50.073 --> 19:53.778
Langley. I don't remember a lot on business. So it 
wasn't totally unfamiliar with me, but about the

19:57.363 --> 20:08.318
time I got back, De Gaulle was just taking over. And 
France was right on the verge of civil war. I mean

20:13.726 --> 20:15.569
right on the brink of the civil war. Or the Algerian 
affair. Yes. I know this because I had some friends

20:18.676 --> 20:26.765
of French officers who informed me of it. It was 
close. Now, the

20:29.949 --> 20:48.210
fact that de Gaulle wanted us out of France and 
France out of NATO had to do with his idea of the

20:29.949 --> 20:48.210
grandeur of France. Now look, don't get me wrong, 
de Gaulle was a great man. He was one of the great men

20:54.528 --> 20:58.092
of our century. But he was great for France. He 
didn't give batshit about the United States or

21:00.595 --> 21:05.920
Britain or Yugoslavia or anywhere. It was la belle 
France. And he did what he thought was right for

21:10.786 --> 21:13.649
France. Maybe he's right, maybe he's wrong, I 
don't know.

21:18.734 --> 21:26.364
The fact of the matter is that NATO as a fighting 
outfit is just about the same. You're going to get

21:27.726 --> 21:31.992
about as much out of the French Air Force as you got 
when it was in NATO. It's not going to be

21:32.032 --> 21:36.077
appreciably different. So, I don't know how to 
answer your question. Okay, okay.

21:42.526 --> 21:47.232
What were your duties as Chief of Staff? Damn 
little... keeping the peace mainly. I think, on

21:50.552 --> 21:58.845
retrospect, I thought, well, here's something, 
here's an old guy that we might as well give him a

21:50.552 --> 21:58.845
pleasant place to live for his last few years. That 
may have been it. But I came back to retire. I wasn't

22:04.314 --> 22:07.539
doing anything worth much. And I was told, God damn 
it, shut up and go on back. And I found out, I guess,

22:12.042 --> 22:17.689
when I got back, that somebody in Punggol knew 
something I didn't, I guess. And there was

22:17.729 --> 22:28.343
something to do, but it was quite different from 
what I had done in the past.

22:28.363 --> 22:37.915
I think I did a good job, but as far as work, no.

22:38.333 --> 22:45.421
I spent my time interested, when I found out I was 
going to have to stay out of my term, diving in the

22:38.333 --> 22:45.421
Mediterranean. That was fascinating. Scuba 
diving. But in terms of duty, I

22:50.025 --> 23:05.742
guess the thing could be described as trying to 
prevent fires, trying to prevent problems from

22:50.025 --> 23:05.742
happening. Dog simple. Why'd you retire? Why did 
you retire? Well, officially I retired for

23:11.630 --> 23:19.617
physical disability, but actually I was coming up 
for mandatory retirement pretty quick anyway.

23:23.901 --> 23:25.983
Were you ready to retire from the service? Oh, yes. 
Of course.

23:31.468 --> 23:36.032
You see, there's a time for everything, as the poem 
says. I'd

23:36.957 --> 23:42.242
lost my love affair with airplanes. I flew them. 
But damn business on the ground had gotten so

23:44.264 --> 23:53.572
complicated, and there was so much red tape, and 
I'm here, and I'm going to be there, and all this

23:44.264 --> 23:53.572
reporting to half a dozen stations. It wasn't much 
fun for me anymore. It was totally different from

23:58.056 --> 24:05.283
what I had started back when I had the love affair 
with airplanes. That was in it. And shoot, you

24:07.147 --> 24:12.798
don't want to stay in that kind of racket too long. I 
don't mean by that I enjoy retirement. I don't at

24:16.385 --> 24:16.986
all. Never had. Never expected. I much preferred 
the active life that I had, but I certainly knew it

24:21.596 --> 24:27.026
was time to retire. No question about that.

24:37.201 --> 24:41.887
I'll make one more statement about Naito, and I'll 
illustrate it again. Another guy from Texas A&M,

24:41.927 --> 24:45.812
he was one of my students in the flying school. I've 
known him ever since. He was a hell of a good man. I

24:48.536 --> 24:54.543
came home and needed somebody to be my exec and 
asked him if he wanted the job. He said he was

24:54.583 --> 24:57.487
delighted to get it. So he brought his family over 
there. The first thing I did, he came out of the Air

25:00.171 --> 25:05.858
War College, and I know what he'd been taught 
there. Send him out to find out under what exact

25:07.559 --> 25:16.387
terms the nations in NATO would go to war. And he 
came back shaking his head, and I can't believe it.

25:25.536 --> 25:26.657
I did it on purpose. This is a common sense guy that 
has to understand that he's an Alice in Wonderland

25:27.178 --> 25:35.946
situation. It's through the looking glass. You 
see it that way. On this side, you see it the other

25:39.414 --> 25:41.717
way. That's NATO. That's the best simple 
explanation I can give for it. What was his answer?

25:46.583 --> 25:47.304
What did they say? Every goddamn one of them has a 
different will. Here's what the treaty says. An

25:55.455 --> 25:57.257
attack on one is an attack on all.

26:00.241 --> 26:01.562
The United States doesn't say that. Neither does 
any other country in NATO. That's what the treaty

26:05.107 --> 26:06.329
says. Mm-hmm.

26:11.245 --> 26:16.832
In some circumstances this would be true, in 
others it wouldn't. That's NATO.

26:21.458 --> 26:26.185
NATO as an intelligence situation couldn't be 
worse. It's an absolute sieve. Anything by way of

26:31.091 --> 26:39.482
an order, NATO order, is automatically available 
to the other side. And you know this. This is one of

26:42.110 --> 26:47.238
the things that you have to deal with. But Larry 
Norstad is a genius. He's an absolute genius. Who

26:54.008 --> 26:54.649
is this now? Norstad, who is the commander who's 
been in NATO ever since it started. He's an

27:00.978 --> 27:07.929
absolute genius in understanding these things 
and coping with them.

27:09.431 --> 27:10.092
I used to think, all right, if we have a war, who's 
coming over to run the war? And I had a pretty good

27:15.730 --> 27:16.852
idea. It would have been either Partridge or 
Weiland, because Larry's genius does not extend

27:17.253 --> 27:31.355
to that particular type of duty, but for that duty, 
you couldn't have had a better man. De Gaulle said

27:31.375 --> 27:32.357
as much.

27:36.003 --> 27:38.847
I'm just trying to illustrate the nature of that 
type of duty. Now let's talk a little bit about some

27:39.687 --> 27:47.055
major changes in the military that we've had over 
the last, well since the 1950s. One was we, the

27:48.776 --> 27:52.420
military, and I'd just like your opinion on it. I 
know that you weren't involved with a lot of these

27:52.440 --> 27:57.405
things, but that's all right. I'd just like your 
opinion. One was ending the Selective Service,

27:58.546 --> 28:04.112
the draft, and now having a volunteer army. What do 
you think of that?

28:13.690 --> 28:16.074
I'm sorry, but I have to give you my point of view. 
That's what I want. This is a political question. A

28:21.261 --> 28:25.047
military person does his best to live with 
whatever the politicians give him. To put it

28:27.010 --> 28:30.194
another way, there are advantages to both sides. 
And you live with compromise, whatever the

28:30.655 --> 28:35.542
politicians say it should be. There are obvious 
advantages to one or the other. I've lived with

28:39.848 --> 28:41.411
both. Mm-hmm. What do you think of the increased 
number of women in the armed forces?

28:52.010 --> 29:00.041
One of my best friends among the women in the 
service is the first woman to be head of the Air

28:52.010 --> 29:00.041
Women, Gina Holmes. She was my diving partner in 
the Mediterranean. If I was in a firefight, I'd

29:03.926 --> 29:09.153
just as soon have Gina as anybody I know. That's 
about as high a compliment as I can give. On the

29:13.698 --> 29:28.674
other hand, if it was a long slog out,

29:13.698 --> 29:28.674
she just simply doesn't have the physical 
stamina.

29:28.694 --> 29:29.455
She'd deny that. She's a good athlete, but this is a 
fact of life. She has done more for the Air Force

29:35.121 --> 29:39.486
than anybody ever. to increase utilization and 
the wider spread utilization of women in the Air

29:40.040 --> 29:45.625
Force. Jeannie's retired, of course, but she's a 
major gentleman. Well, she finished. First one we

29:48.869 --> 29:49.950
ever had. Boy, she's worth it. I hope I'm making 
myself clear. I don't want to call that gal down. I

29:57.057 --> 30:03.523
say, if I was in a firefight, I'd just as soon have 
her as any man I've ever been with, and I've been

29:57.057 --> 30:03.523
with some damn good men. But there's more to that. 
Also, in a complex staff situation, no problem

30:10.027 --> 30:12.770
with her. The only problem I see with women in the 
service is this god-awful situation, you get him

30:13.891 --> 30:27.425
now and then, that requires a hell of a lot of 
physical stamina, and don't get me wrong, all men

30:13.891 --> 30:27.425
don't have it either. Right. So, that's about all I 
can say. Okay. What do you think about the

30:37.634 --> 30:46.205
increased number of black Americans and 
integration of units in the service?

30:47.907 --> 30:58.160
One of my best friends in the service, not really, 
but a very good friend in the service was Benno

30:47.907 --> 30:58.160
Davis, who was the first black general, finished 
as a lieutenant general. One of the best men I've

30:58.180 --> 31:00.563
ever known. Benno put his whole self on the line, 
his whole career, everything, on a on a premise.

31:10.320 --> 31:14.246
This is way back, not too long after the war. You 
treat everybody alike regardless of his color.

31:18.292 --> 31:20.756
Everybody takes the same exam. Everybody takes 
the same requirement. And the black men that can't

31:25.283 --> 31:28.467
hack it, get out. The white men that can't hack it, 
get out. Ben couldn't have been righter. He's

31:35.458 --> 31:37.020
absolutely right. As long as we in the Air Force 
were able to follow that, and mind you, it was a hell

31:37.709 --> 31:44.517
of a lot to overcome before we could. And I was 
there. We were in clover. There was no such thing as

31:50.743 --> 31:53.567
a Negro problem. Unfortunately, that couldn't 
last, because you know what happened. The Civil

31:59.533 --> 32:01.275
Rights Program came along. The laws were changed. 
And the worst thing you can do is to give a Negro

32:08.050 --> 32:18.988
soldier or a Jew soldier or a Spanish soldier an 
idea that he has certain rights because of his

32:08.050 --> 32:18.988
color. That has happened, and it's a tragedy. 
That's the worst feature of it. As long as

32:25.639 --> 32:32.590
everybody is treated just the same, to the same 
standards, by God, you don't have a problem.

32:33.717 --> 32:36.620
except, of course, with the ignorant bigots. And 
you can't get rid of ignorant bigots. You always

32:39.683 --> 32:40.664
have them. But you can make them come to terms with 
it as long as they're all meeting the same

32:42.186 --> 32:47.151
standards. But when somebody gets a special right 
that he shouldn't have, you've got trouble.

32:56.681 --> 32:57.662
I'll illustrate that. Hell, the place that I've 
set up, built, and commanded first, Laredo before

33:03.974 --> 33:05.996
they closed it. Had some Negroes, and this was 
since I retired, come into a mess hall and inhabit

33:07.138 --> 33:22.415
it just as though it was a mutiny and defy the people 
because they felt not that they were being

33:07.138 --> 33:22.415
discriminated out there, because they were 
discriminated in town. Now, nobody has the right

33:22.455 --> 33:29.542
to come in and take over a mess hall. If he's got a 
bitch, he's got a right to bitch. But when that

33:34.467 --> 33:41.456
happened, the commander was unable to do what I 
would have done, and could have done, in the same

33:34.467 --> 33:41.456
circumstance. He had to send for a negotiator, a 
negro, a master sergeant, assigned for that

33:41.516 --> 33:52.310
purpose at his headquarters to come down and 
negotiate with those men. This ain't good.

33:57.778 --> 34:01.943
I don't want to weigh in on that problem too much,

34:03.239 --> 34:05.382
I've lived with it when it was a damn sight better. 
It's pretty simple, once you can get people to get

34:07.344 --> 34:18.557
it through their heads and do it, to treat 
everybody just exactly alike.

34:18.577 --> 34:22.783
Make them all meet the same standards for 
promotion, for pay, for rank, for whatever. No

34:24.124 --> 34:24.705
problem. There's the most unfortunate feature of 
it, which you're well aware of, When you're

34:33.496 --> 34:50.414
dealing with very large numbers of people, you're 
going to find out that the IQ rating on a very large

34:33.496 --> 34:50.414
number, the lower ones are going to turn out to be 
Negroes, disproportionate to their numbers in

34:33.496 --> 34:50.414
the population. I don't want to go into that 
because I know the exceptions to it. People like

34:55.720 --> 34:56.600
Ben.

35:00.084 --> 35:01.866
Ben is quite a man.

35:04.597 --> 35:16.394
The other one who reached high regard, his dad died 
of a heart attack, used to command the Air Defense

35:04.597 --> 35:16.394
Command, Chappie, Chappie James. He was a 
four-star general when he retired. That was the

35:18.998 --> 35:22.163
man that saved him and put him on the right track. 
Chappie was a damn good man, too. But when he was a

35:26.088 --> 35:31.296
wheeler-dealer radical, he had to get 
straightened out and learned that he had to live to

35:31.563 --> 35:35.287
the same standards that other people did. Ben 
taught him that. By God, look what happened. He

35:39.252 --> 35:40.794
ended up as a four-star general. So this can be 
done. There's no Negro problem if you treat

35:46.860 --> 35:50.965
everybody alike. The problem comes up when you 
start elevating a white man because he's white or

35:52.127 --> 35:59.375
elevating a black man because he's black. That's 
where the problem is. But I don't think this

36:02.208 --> 36:04.531
country is going to change about that. Let's drop 
it. Okay. Let's go to leadership. Oh, that's the

36:09.437 --> 36:16.366
word that military people use the most and nobody 
can define. I know what I think it is. What do you

36:18.730 --> 36:19.911
think it is? I've already described it. It's what I 
learned down in ROTC. That's what I think. But

36:29.604 --> 36:30.645
there comes a time When it means something else. 
When it means something else. Something you don't

36:39.616 --> 36:41.298
learn in A&M. What time is that? At a higher rank. 
Well what does it mean then? What does it mean then?

36:50.692 --> 36:52.414
Yeah, at higher rank. It means a different kind of 
talent.

36:59.444 --> 37:01.307
It means an ability to to deal with your peers, not 
with your subordinates, because leadership is

37:02.873 --> 37:13.469
generally thought of as being able to deal with and 
lead your subordinates. But leadership in the

37:13.489 --> 37:23.724
higher ranks means an ability to deal with your 
peers and to, as it were, lead them whether or not

37:13.489 --> 37:23.724
they want to be led. And it's quite a different 
proposition.

37:30.903 --> 37:34.066
think, I don't know whether that observation did 
any good. Now let's talk a little bit, final topic

37:34.407 --> 37:37.230
here. Let's talk a little bit about the changes 
over the last 20 years at Texas A&M. Now I know you

37:46.339 --> 37:50.684
weren't involved with those changes, but you must 
have some opinions on them. For example, we ended

37:51.585 --> 37:59.593
the mandatory Corps of Cadets. Do you think that's 
good or bad for A&M? What's your opinion? The

38:04.492 --> 38:06.755
difference was good or bad or not, it had to be done. 
I can speak a little bit on this, because I was

38:08.458 --> 38:15.829
working for that Governor Connelly's commission 
at the time. This had to be done. And one of the men I

38:17.632 --> 38:21.659
admired beyond reason was Earl Rudder. I don't 
think anybody else could have done it. Earl Rudder

38:25.605 --> 38:28.990
had to do that, and he had to see to it that the women 
got in there. Both of those things had to be done.

38:32.503 --> 38:38.732
All you had to do was to lay out the problem, which is 
what I was helping to do. I was dismayed, I must

38:38.752 --> 38:46.503
admit, but Rudder was in no way dismayed. He knew 
what had to be done. He did it. If he hadn't been the

38:49.948 --> 38:55.235
kind of man he was, A&M would have had hell.

38:58.139 --> 38:59.922
I'm very much admired. Sorry he's dead. What was 
your role in that? What was your role in that?

39:08.320 --> 39:09.141
Nothing really. I was trying to get things 
together for the commission.

39:15.930 --> 39:18.433
In the process I learned some things I'd rather not 
know. In fact that was one of them. I didn't realize

39:21.758 --> 39:28.727
until I began to deal with this that

39:30.428 --> 39:32.871
NM was as far behind the times as it was. And I didn't 
realize, see, my, if I know anything much, it's how

39:35.113 --> 39:43.041
to deal with figures. For example, I deal with the 
stock market now, and that's the easiest way to

39:45.164 --> 39:50.689
make money I've ever run across, honestly. I know 
what cost effectiveness is because I do. I was

39:59.116 --> 40:07.907
really shocked to see what the 
cost-effectiveness factor of Texas A&M was when I

39:59.116 --> 40:07.907
got into it. And the things that Rudder did had to be 
done because of that. There's no other reason.

40:17.760 --> 40:25.309
I thought, because I was in it, that the old ROTC 
system at A&M was good.

40:28.512 --> 40:29.333
You couldn't do it. You couldn't do it and

40:29.954 --> 40:37.421
discharge your responsibilities to the people of 
the state of Texas. Do you follow me? Yeah. That's

40:39.564 --> 40:40.925
why it had to be done. I won't argue the good or bad 
features of it had to be done. Same with allowing

40:48.673 --> 40:51.897
women and blacks into Texas. Same thing.

40:55.941 --> 40:57.743
Same thing. hope, and it's nothing but hope, that 
the scholastic standards can be kept up. I don't

41:07.218 --> 41:07.979
really know. You see, when I went there, you got a 
tremendous influx every fall, and then they start

41:08.019 --> 41:17.172
going home, just like that. In other words, the law 
required that they take them, but the law didn't

41:18.474 --> 41:23.140
require that they keep them. When the guy got out of 
there, whether he was in animal husbandry or

41:25.398 --> 41:33.912
whether he was in civil engineering, you knew 
goddamn well he knew certain things that you had to

41:25.398 --> 41:33.912
know or he didn't get out. I hope that's still true.

41:40.141 --> 41:41.724
It can be, but it depends. I don't know. I don't 
know. I just don't know anything about the school

41:47.073 --> 41:49.416
now. I hope so.

41:55.722 --> 41:59.847
I think probably so, but that's a guess. What 
little bit I'm able to gather from the various

42:00.568 --> 42:05.054
reports I read. You're in a better fix to answer 
that question than I am. Well, I'm about exhausted

42:12.343 --> 42:16.869
the questions that I have. No, I meant whether or 
not the standards of the institution are still

42:17.170 --> 42:20.894
high. I think they are. Hope so. I think we just 
raised the entrance standards. I heard that. Back

42:29.760 --> 42:36.609
then, you see, they didn't have the entrance 
standard problem. Say, I've got one more thing

42:36.629 --> 42:41.256
that goes back a long way. It has to do with the 
education and the military person. I had a

42:47.806 --> 42:53.033
contemporary who was a little bit ahead of me in 
flying school who became One of the Air Force's

42:53.333 --> 42:57.958
best aeronautical engineers.

43:00.500 --> 43:04.885
You would never guess that he graduated from East 
Texas State Teacher's College. You know goddamn

43:05.726 --> 43:08.489
well they didn't teach him anything about that. 
But when he died, he was crashed, of course. He was

43:15.296 --> 43:18.379
on his way to command that test facility out there 
at Edwards. And there's no flies on him. He learned

43:22.561 --> 43:26.867
what he had to learn in the Air Force, I mean about 
the technology. So it ain't necessarily so that

43:28.069 --> 43:37.503
you have to get a lot of this crammed in your head in 
college. Okay, finish. Well, I'm done with the

43:40.467 --> 43:42.470
questions. Is there something else that you... 
No, God almighty, I'm sorry I kept you so long. No,

43:47.197 --> 43:50.121
is there something about your career that I might
