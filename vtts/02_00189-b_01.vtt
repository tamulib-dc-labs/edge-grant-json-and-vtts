WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:03.973
The student body. Describe the student body. Who 
was here? What kind of students, people, where

00:07.278 --> 00:10.443
were they from?

00:15.791 --> 00:17.033
What was their tip? What

00:17.694 --> 00:28.030
was their basic attitude about life and so forth? 
Oh, I don't think it's a lot different now than it

00:28.955 --> 00:40.065
was

00:28.955 --> 00:40.065
then. To me, the biggest entrepreneur in the 
world, right?

00:47.272 --> 00:50.055
All kinds of opportunities. Is it chicken or egg? 
Were they that way before they got to A&M? I don't

00:55.100 --> 00:55.620
think so. You think A&M? Not necessarily.

01:01.780 --> 01:03.501
Part of it could be. What is it at A&M that caused 
that, that generates that?

01:12.732 --> 01:15.435
There again, I go back to the court. And I don't know 
how you could say that would cause it today, since

01:16.516 --> 01:24.105
it's such a small part of the body. But he's still a

01:24.777 --> 01:35.408
very big part of it.

01:42.395 --> 01:43.175
But I don't really have a good answer. Just a 
spirit. But you don't get anywhere else. And many

01:50.663 --> 01:52.725
muster his life. What

01:52.975 --> 02:19.793
are

01:52.975 --> 02:19.793
the factors that youth can think of that 
contribute to that spirit?

02:26.540 --> 02:52.707
I

02:26.540 --> 02:52.707
guess the fact that

02:26.540 --> 02:52.707
you probably

02:26.540 --> 02:52.707
have a

02:26.540 --> 02:52.707
place in life that you wouldn't

02:26.540 --> 02:52.707
have if you hadn't been a part of the university. 
And it's such that

02:56.375 --> 03:00.045
It's a very real thing. And it's displayed in many 
ways.

03:04.677 --> 03:11.515
And it's probably not even recognized as such by 
anyone else around.

03:27.239 --> 03:53.398
points

03:27.239 --> 03:53.398
in life.

03:58.660 --> 04:00.520
Thank you.

04:30.622 --> 04:33.185
All right, the student body, small town. Let's 
talk about the diversity. Were there some Jewish?

04:39.614 --> 04:53.271
Economically,

04:39.614 --> 04:53.271
the typical Aggie came from what kind of family? 
Did

04:55.428 --> 05:18.381
it matter whether a kid was from a rich or poor 
family?

05:18.401 --> 05:20.203
No, absolutely not. Not at all. And it didn't 
matter what religion. Those were important.

05:25.313 --> 05:26.875
Let's jump on that a second. How were Jewish 
students treated? Oh, just like any other. How

05:31.901 --> 05:34.724
were the Catholic students treated? Just like any 
other. Did you all have any nicknames?

05:41.492 --> 05:41.592
No. Right now, I see earlier I learned that some of 
the Jewish students were called Jew boy, but it was

05:41.612 --> 05:51.623
not meant negative, like you might be called 
country. And were there any international

05:51.643 --> 05:54.747
students that you were

05:55.283 --> 06:05.902
aware of? In petroleum engineering

06:05.922 --> 06:16.701
in particular?

06:17.626 --> 06:22.317
Did they come to A&M specifically for the 
engineering? Was there a special link that

06:22.337 --> 06:27.310
brought them? I really don't know. Well, I'm 
certain it was a national company in Mexico or

06:33.269 --> 06:44.067
something up here in the United States. I'm sure 
they could put it down there. And I'm sure over

06:47.332 --> 06:56.887
there, particularly in Saudi Arabia, it was 
around the coast, some of the bigger oil companies

06:47.332 --> 06:56.887
were trying to get some natives over there 
trained. Were they non-reg or were they in the

06:56.907 --> 06:59.051
Corps? No, they were not. that I know of. Lived on 
campus?

07:06.459 --> 07:06.559
Yeah. Well, that causes me to mention, were there 
faculty living on campus much?

07:13.947 --> 07:25.180
South

07:13.947 --> 07:25.180
of where physics, south and east of G. Raleigh?

07:30.172 --> 07:35.239
Well, maybe south of G. Ronald. I'm sorry. East but 
west. Well, there were practice students there.

07:40.567 --> 07:41.709
You're in the project houses. Yeah.

07:45.014 --> 07:46.676
There weren't any faculty houses left? No. Okay. 
Because, see, the faculty had once lived on the

07:49.921 --> 07:56.230
campus there south of where the Colas building is 
now. Really? Yeah. Did not know that. Oh, yeah.

07:59.212 --> 07:59.733
They were gone. OK. Married student housing? 
Because of what they call it, bed building. A lot of

08:08.087 --> 08:11.112
beds.

08:12.394 --> 08:12.795
Let's see. Korean War. Korean War was going right 
on. While you get there. That's right. All right.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.432
Let's talk about that a second. What did you and 
your friends, what did y'all think you were going

08:23.952 --> 08:33.006
to be facing worldwide? Did you think that you 
might be in some kind of active duty military? Oh,

08:38.334 --> 08:43.543
there's no question I was going to be on active 
duty. When I signed the contract, I signed on for

08:43.563 --> 08:48.631
two years active duty, six years inactive. So, you 
know, I had an eight-year delay. It ends up I'm

08:50.733 --> 08:55.837
having to be a Cold War veteran, but I could have 
been a very hot one very quickly.

09:00.641 --> 09:15.454
I went

09:00.641 --> 09:15.454
out to find out what petroleum was needed and I was 
able to do that for a year and a half after I got out of

09:00.641 --> 09:15.454
university.

09:15.474 --> 09:20.098
So before I didn't go in until like 1956 and came 
back out in 1958, What world event, world or

09:20.838 --> 09:30.575
national events, do you remember happening while 
you were an undergraduate that seemed to you very

09:20.838 --> 09:30.575
significant to you? I think I bought a green one 
because we had several plans . But

09:42.978 --> 10:04.125
there

09:42.978 --> 10:04.125
weren't

09:42.978 --> 10:04.125
any assassinations? Like I tell people, every one 
of

10:04.831 --> 10:21.453
them...

10:04.831 --> 10:21.453
Let's go on to 55.

10:25.939 --> 10:28.142
Were there any...

10:32.428 --> 10:34.230
Were there any... important visitors to the 
campus, notable individuals who came to speak?

10:47.872 --> 10:57.707
Not like

10:47.872 --> 10:57.707
we have.

10:57.727 --> 10:59.830
But by the time I got out of here, I had heard most of 
the big things. Such as? And

11:06.020 --> 11:19.872
most of those played, where were their concerts?

11:22.995 --> 11:24.877
No, but where was the dance, where were the dances 
held? At Sabisa. And how did people... How did

11:31.805 --> 11:34.268
people behave at those?

11:40.114 --> 11:42.056
Just like they should. Just like you'd expect. 
Let's see, I'm not asking anybody else this

11:44.338 --> 11:46.641
question. What were the evils that you and your 
buddies knew about?

11:55.130 --> 11:57.913
Telling bad jokes, using bad language, What did, 
what drinking, what did drinking mean? If

12:03.072 --> 12:07.981
somebody was going to be drinking, what were they 
drinking? Well, okay, let's say it's a freshman

12:08.001 --> 12:13.352
year. The first, the first time in a lot that a guy 
has ever hit you. And

12:19.088 --> 12:46.280
if people were smoking, what were they smoking?

12:48.102 --> 12:48.302
What? What did y'all know about other than tobacco 
of some sort?

12:55.800 --> 13:04.248
Driving fast, telling bad jokes, chasing girls,

12:55.800 --> 13:04.248
and only bumpkins chewed tobacco.

13:06.911 --> 13:10.115
Country, you know, country. Unless you played 
baseball. Oh yeah, that was different.

13:16.541 --> 13:18.103
Of course you can't do that now.

13:21.121 --> 13:30.578
Let's

13:21.121 --> 13:30.578
see. These dances. Did you dance with the same girl 
for every dance that night? Every number? Could

13:41.303 --> 14:04.020
a guy go without a date and cut in?

14:04.928 --> 14:13.484
All right, would you then and one of your friends 
ever for the next dance swap partners? Okay, sure.

14:15.507 --> 14:18.012
And you would do that only though with friends? 
Some people, no. Yeah, didn't do it with

14:19.014 --> 14:25.205
strangers? No. But she didn't come all the way down 
for, you know, being humiliated. G. Raleigh,

14:28.368 --> 14:39.524
describe going to an important event in G. 
Raleigh,

14:28.368 --> 14:39.524
why? Because it was built during your time.

14:47.487 --> 15:06.515
How

14:47.487 --> 15:06.515
big did y'all think it was when it

14:47.487 --> 15:06.515
was finished? Was your commencement held there?

15:13.204 --> 15:14.406
Please describe...

15:16.867 --> 15:26.996
The biggest difference I've seen now is in the 
commission ceremony.

15:30.900 --> 15:37.466
We had several hundred getting commissions.

15:37.846 --> 15:40.268
Now it's just a handful. I don't need to go take a 
look. It's amazing. I didn't know that. Describe

15:46.111 --> 15:50.917
commissioning and commencement was on the same 
day? On the same day. Describe that day. Who was

15:54.161 --> 15:55.083
there? Oh,

15:57.045 --> 16:09.802
of course, my parents and

15:57.045 --> 16:09.802
my wife. Probably my sister. Probably, yeah. Was 
there a, do you even remember who the speaker was?

16:15.874 --> 16:20.340
Was it somebody of the? No, but I tell you, I 
remember one of the things. I had the

16:27.069 --> 16:34.900
opportunity to get the speaker for our senior, our 
senior base.

16:40.567 --> 16:47.275
.

16:47.295 --> 16:55.125
.

16:55.145 --> 17:09.122
.

17:09.828 --> 17:31.169
And

17:09.828 --> 17:31.169
you're

17:09.828 --> 17:31.169
inferring that when he got through, y'all did 
wonder why you'd ask. The senior and the senior

17:31.409 --> 17:35.413
band, who went to the senior banquet? Was this for 
dates, or was it only the seniors? Dates.

17:51.255 --> 17:55.700
And at commencement, name was called, everybody, 
hands were shaking. So what kind of? .

18:09.008 --> 18:12.433
That you had cleared all your courses? What was

18:13.494 --> 18:35.404
a normal academic load per semester?

18:37.122 --> 18:53.183
There's

18:37.122 --> 18:53.183
all those labs.

18:56.708 --> 19:02.556
Do you remember most of your classes being large or 
small? I

19:04.477 --> 19:27.061
remember

19:04.477 --> 19:27.061
a lot with the technical

19:04.477 --> 19:27.061
chemistry, some of the more basic geology 
courses. Some of those were the slowest. But

19:30.105 --> 19:33.268
speaking of the others, the last two or three 
years, we've had only probably 15 problems, and

19:30.105 --> 19:33.268
normally probably 25 or 30. Were your 
instructors, your teachers, were they

19:33.805 --> 19:39.637
accessible if you needed to talk to them? Let's

19:40.819 --> 19:46.330
see. We talked about some of John's. Did you have a 
car? No. Never had a car. Never had a car. Did you

19:52.683 --> 19:55.088
ever borrow anybody else's? If so, what were the 
rules about? No, but I had a roommate that had one

19:58.917 --> 20:07.816
of the last two years. Actually, the last three 
years. So usually I had a wife. And here were all

20:10.923 --> 20:12.907
kinds of questions. I was going to ask about how did 
a guy who didn't have a girlfriend had to get a date.

20:18.126 --> 20:20.210
Those don't apply to you. You dated the same young 
lady. Let's see. Was there a guy named Pinky Downs

20:23.657 --> 20:26.482
around then? I don't

20:27.063 --> 20:36.300
know who the new Pinky Downs is. There's not. Bupo.

21:05.167 --> 21:15.597
But Bo was a very strong

21:05.167 --> 21:15.597
man, and he later

21:05.167 --> 21:15.597
was. He was always the one that, if you needed 
something in the making, you could probably go to

21:15.617 --> 21:20.843
him. You could probably get along with him. Were 
anybody important in the commandant's area

21:23.245 --> 21:30.012
during your days that you remember? Let's see. 
Colonel Davis was the commandant. Please

21:33.896 --> 21:35.157
describe him. I asked

21:36.537 --> 21:54.190
him if he was the biggest son in the house. I'm sure 
he wasn't an old man, but maybe older, but he made

21:54.210 --> 21:56.655
quite an appearance.

22:06.895 --> 22:31.958
student

22:06.895 --> 22:31.958
organizations what was the most prestigious 
undergraduate student position office

22:06.895 --> 22:31.958
if you could have been anything on campus

22:06.895 --> 22:31.958
we really didn't have

22:06.895 --> 22:31.958
a The student body president, the closest to that 
would be the president of the student senate or the

22:32.478 --> 22:43.009
president of the senior platoon. But was that as 
high in prestige as corps commander?

22:49.757 --> 22:53.701
They're

22:49.757 --> 22:53.701
different.

22:56.464 --> 22:56.564
Okay. Probably not. All right, other positions 
of... I think as I look at it, later in life, I think

23:01.300 --> 23:05.908
it's probably a lot higher. But it's necessary to 
make sure. At the time, what were the other key

23:08.232 --> 23:12.780
student positions on campus?

23:18.531 --> 23:19.693
Student Corps. Correct. Student Corps.

23:36.552 --> 24:03.336
What

23:36.552 --> 24:03.336
did you and your classmates think about the Aggie 
Band? They were always

24:04.480 --> 24:12.570
changing songs when we'd go by to review them. So 
what's different?

24:16.616 --> 24:25.587
We thought

24:16.616 --> 24:25.587
they

24:16.616 --> 24:25.587
were great. Can you share any information about 
supposedly secret fraternities? The T.T.s. Was

24:34.535 --> 24:35.377
there such? Well, there evidently was because I 
lost my freshman squad commander. And then his

24:46.299 --> 24:52.712
brother, a classmate of mine, got busted as a 
senior. Supposedly because they belong to this

24:54.211 --> 24:58.897
same secret true text. Apparently. Surely 
somebody has talked to you about that. Well, I

25:03.404 --> 25:09.632
really don't know that much about it. Nobody has 
known? It's a mysterious thing. Two or three

25:13.678 --> 25:15.800
people said it didn't exist at all. Well, I think it 
did. It had to. Do you have any idea as to how many?

25:21.363 --> 25:23.086
How many members? Members? I had a placement that 
seemed to know more about it than I did. We were

25:31.942 --> 25:35.789
always getting into politics together. I'd 
nominate him, and he'd nominate me. But he... He

25:41.090 --> 25:45.114
really seemed to think Uncle Ed was the T.T. 
hanging. Maybe you've heard of that. I don't know.

25:48.016 --> 25:48.877
I've heard that. And that apparently the object of 
the T.T.' 's was to get their members elected. In

25:57.425 --> 25:58.306
control. In control of key positions on campus. 
That's what it sounds like. All right. Have you

26:10.497 --> 26:12.119
heard mention of any other? No. What about the 
stickers? I've never heard of that. Swastikas.

26:18.449 --> 26:20.351
No, I've not heard of that. Apparently there was 
way back in the 20s. Oh, okay. And the swastika,

26:24.898 --> 26:33.792
this was before Adolf Hitler, before the Nazis, 
the Navajo symbol of friendship. And that

26:34.553 --> 26:37.337
supposedly... That was their secret symbol. And 
if you look through the Longhorn in the 20s, you

26:41.681 --> 26:52.075
will see on certain pages a swastika. But no one has 
admitted to me if they were a member or knew a

26:53.016 --> 27:00.747
member. Nobody has yet. And so I've had fun kind of 
asking about that. And as far as anyone has given me

27:08.468 --> 27:19.482
any information, they don't know anyone who they 
knew was a member. But you should have been asked to

27:20.344 --> 27:23.868
call some people. Oh. That said, I do know of some of 
the members that were busted in Miami. Mm-hmm. I

27:33.521 --> 27:37.446
definitely know them there at different times. 
Let's see, did you have any, did you have much

27:38.000 --> 27:50.055
opportunity to ever be in a faculty member's home 
or any other off-campus person?

27:54.400 --> 28:00.428
I can remember with the Churchill there. I can also 
remember the first weekend I don't really

28:07.632 --> 28:36.306
remember

28:07.632 --> 28:36.306
going to anyone's

28:07.632 --> 28:36.306
home

28:07.632 --> 28:36.306
except the president between the flags. So I can

28:37.383 --> 29:06.175
remember going

28:37.383 --> 29:06.175
out to this one old professor on Thanksgiving or 
Thanksgiving afternoon or something and just

28:37.383 --> 29:06.175
visiting. But that's, and I can remember, as I 
said, being the president's own, David Morgan,

29:07.066 --> 29:16.743
but mainly all the students. Did you ever hear any 
stories, reports, of any faculty or professional

29:16.763 --> 29:25.799
staff misbehavior, indiscretions? No. That's 
the answer I would have assumed. Let's

29:32.345 --> 29:37.610
see.

29:45.678 --> 29:48.621
Have you described a court trip yet? No. Okay. Tell 
me about a court trip. I don't remember the first

29:51.704 --> 29:56.709
time. I don't remember the first word.

30:06.466 --> 30:21.075
How

30:06.466 --> 30:21.075
did you get from College Station to Fort Worth?

30:25.965 --> 30:28.710
Hitchhiking? And

30:28.927 --> 30:57.168
you all would gather at about what time, say for 
Fort Worth, where would you gather and where

30:28.927 --> 30:57.168
would you march? I think it's always downtown. 
They

30:58.525 --> 31:20.333
normally, they,

30:58.525 --> 31:20.333
uh, listen, I would say, up to the courthouse, to 
the magistrate, and they, uh, come on and want to

30:58.525 --> 31:20.333
fit in that. It's a matter of who you want to get. Uh, 
back then, we, we would go to, uh, each one of the,

31:21.114 --> 31:23.537
uh, boards, and then we'd establish an office for 
the other kids. What was the reaction of the

31:23.703 --> 31:30.977
audience, the onlookers, as you all were 
marching? All very, very hard.
