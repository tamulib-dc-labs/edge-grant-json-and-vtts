WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:19.393
We publish booklets and we give them information 
in closing and we visit with all the landscape

00:03.068 --> 00:19.393
architects and architectural, I mean, landscape 
firms that operate in the woodlands to try to get

00:03.068 --> 00:19.393
them to think about this natural environment and 
saving trees. So that's an ongoing process. Yeah,

00:22.897 --> 00:29.644
every year we have something called Arbor Day and 
we've given away, how many of them? 330,000

00:29.664 --> 00:33.167
seedlings and small trees. And people stand in 
line to get those trees and they take them home and

00:33.688 --> 00:40.114
plant them in the yard. And we just got together in 
the Wildflower Festival. Wildflowers are deeply

00:45.059 --> 00:48.803
a part of the image of the woodlands. Lady Bird 
Johnson has been here for several seminars. She's

00:52.087 --> 00:53.910
deeply involved in wildflowers. And Texas 
wildflowers are something we plant and cultivate

00:53.930 --> 01:02.744
every year and have a very well-defined program to 
propagate those. At what point following 86 did

01:03.646 --> 01:10.316
you feel like you were rounding the hump, let's 
say, of the financial? You may not have felt that

01:10.337 --> 01:13.301
way yet. I guess we're still working on it. 
Statistically, the third quarter of 1987 is when

01:16.205 --> 01:23.195
the Houston economy started rebounding. I think 
we gained 12,000 jobs in Houston in the third

01:24.357 --> 01:31.367
quarter of 1987 after having lost 200,000. That 
was the first time you could see it coming back. In

01:34.592 --> 01:45.047
1988, I think we gained maybe 30,000 jobs at about 
that level, maybe 40,000 jobs in 1989.

01:46.090 --> 01:59.887
According to a study done by Barton Smith at the 
University of Houston, you probably know,

01:46.090 --> 01:59.887
Houston is now about 60% energy dependent, where 
it was 80% energy dependent. And the strengths

01:59.907 --> 02:09.919
are, you know, the port of Houston, it's number one 
in the nation in terms of export tonnage. And most

02:09.939 --> 02:12.242
of that is not petroleum related. It's grain and 
foodstuffs and things like that. The NASA Space

02:15.419 --> 02:20.025
Center, of course, has come back strongly during 
the downturn. During that downturn, we were

02:21.466 --> 02:30.397
blessed, too, with the largest highway 
construction program ever undertaken in this

02:21.466 --> 02:30.397
region. More than a billion dollars a year was 
spent on highway construction in the Houston

02:31.058 --> 02:41.691
region, which exceeded any other state in the 
nation except California for a five-year period

02:31.058 --> 02:41.691
of time. And, of course, the tremendous growth and 
expansion of the Texas Medical Center The $5

02:45.760 --> 02:51.629
billion expansion program underway out there and 
it's still ongoing. It really helped the Houston

02:51.649 --> 02:53.452
economy. Compact Computer came into being. It 
didn't exist in 1982. And that's one of the major

02:58.640 --> 03:00.783
companies in this country. And it's located 20 
miles away. The biotechnology industry and

03:04.629 --> 03:10.097
startup companies that have come out of that. Dr. 
Dominic Lamb, you'll enjoy that interview. He's a

03:15.919 --> 03:19.603
very interesting, intelligent, bright, 
energetic person. You'll get a lot from Dr. Lamb.

03:27.453 --> 03:30.376
There was another matter I was going to mention.

03:33.480 --> 03:38.886
Maybe I'll come back to him in a moment. By 88, 
things are... Yeah, by 88, you can see things

03:41.262 --> 03:46.511
moving in the right direction. 89 was a good year. 
This year, we'll have a record year in home sales.

03:51.699 --> 03:59.853
So far, we've sold almost $120 billion worth of 
home sales, $120 million worth of home sales. $120

03:59.993 --> 04:03.338
million worth of new homes this year. Oh, no, the 
Barton Smith study. We had him conduct a study to

04:06.980 --> 04:16.432
determine what is the impact of the Woodlands on 
the economy of Montgomery County. In the early

04:16.452 --> 04:20.357
days, the Woodlands was not well accepted by 
Montgomery County. There's a great deal of

04:20.377 --> 04:24.482
suspicion and doubt and uncertainty. Even 
hostility from the commissioners. Hostility.

04:27.165 --> 04:32.071
And there is still some of that, but it's beginning 
to wane, and obviously it's not so bad. But the

04:32.132 --> 04:36.497
interesting thing about that study is that now the 
Woodlands... It constitutes 17% of the tax base in

04:37.304 --> 04:43.091
the county. It is the biggest single taxpaying 
entity in the county today. At one time, the Conroe

04:46.535 --> 04:52.903
oil field was the dominant economic generator for 
taxes in the county. And now the Woodlands

04:52.923 --> 04:58.229
exceeds, and when I say the Woodlands, I mean all 
the homes, all the development. Collectively.

04:59.350 --> 05:05.758
The Woodlands pays more taxes than the Conroe oil 
field pays to support schools and the county

04:59.350 --> 05:05.758
government. We also now constitute about 16% of 
the voting population in the county.

05:17.401 --> 05:28.315
The community is predominantly Republican, 
predominantly conservative, and it's changed

05:17.401 --> 05:28.315
the shape of politics within the county. When I 
moved here 20 something years ago in Montgomery

05:28.655 --> 05:36.505
County, you could not find anyone who would 
profess to be a Republican. except Dr. Wally

05:37.430 --> 05:40.474
Wilkerson, who was part of the Republican Party. 
Today, you can't find anybody who agrees that

05:41.295 --> 05:44.199
they're a Democrat. Even the local officeholders 
who originally were elected as Democrats have now

05:45.581 --> 05:54.793
changed to the Republican Party for fear of being 
defeated. The Woodlands has done, I think, a

05:54.853 --> 05:59.420
number of positive things for the county. It's 
helped create economic growth. It's helped

06:01.643 --> 06:02.704
create jobs. It's provided, I think, the numbers, 
25% of the... retail sales are generated by people

06:07.518 --> 06:11.424
who live in the Woodlands. That's not 25% of retail 
sales occurring in the Woodlands, but the

06:11.464 --> 06:20.578
population of the Woodlands generates 25% of the 
retail sales. Has this study been published? I'll

06:22.400 --> 06:23.863
give you a copy of it. I think we'd like that. Jack, 
could you see it? It's interesting reading. I got

06:29.812 --> 06:33.357
Dr. Smith to do it, so it would be objective. We 
could do it, but that would not be held to be fairly

06:33.657 --> 06:38.884
objective. Yeah, credibility would be 
questioned. But this will give you some good

06:40.666 --> 06:45.131
background information from a third-party 
source. It's got a good executive summary, and

06:45.232 --> 07:00.711
then he kind of gets involved in the science of 
evaluating demographics and economic

06:45.232 --> 07:00.711
evaluation.

07:01.501 --> 07:06.527
the executive summary makes more exciting 
reading than the methodology.

07:09.651 --> 07:31.018
So, what do you think now, so we're in, you and you 
now, are in a position of potential expansion,

07:09.651 --> 07:31.018
let's say, on the conditions of potentially good, 
but... Well, you know, we've got the same over in

07:09.651 --> 07:31.018
the Gulf, and we've got oil prices that... It went 
down $5 a barrel yesterday, and I don't know what

07:31.623 --> 07:37.208
they've done today. And there is a devastating 
financial condition for financing real estate

07:37.228 --> 07:44.274
nationally. And while the market is good in the 
Houston region, financial institutions don't

07:45.295 --> 07:52.962
look favorably upon real estate financing. So I 
think it's going to have some detrimental effect

07:53.042 --> 08:00.128
on Houston, even though we're doing much better 
than the nation as a whole. We still look to the

08:00.631 --> 08:04.797
money-centered banks for a lot of financing. And I 
don't think that it's going to be as generous as we

08:04.877 --> 08:12.228
would like for it

08:04.877 --> 08:12.228
to be. But so far, we've spent $2 billion in the 
woods total. $2 billion has been invested by all

08:17.516 --> 08:21.222
parties in the woods. A billion dollars of that is 
in residential homes owned by third parties. The

08:26.469 --> 08:28.933
rest of it's in schools and churches office 
buildings and research facilities and land

08:29.217 --> 08:38.749
development and those kinds

08:29.217 --> 08:38.749
of things. Upon completion, total investment in 
the woodlands will be about $12 billion by all

08:38.769 --> 08:45.538
parties. And the population will be somewhere 
around 150,000 people. And we anticipate having

08:50.845 --> 08:55.911
about 80,000 jobs, permanent jobs. Someone 
asked, when are you going to finish developing the

08:55.931 --> 08:59.055
woodlands? and the very clear answer to that we 
never will because no city is ever complete i don't

09:00.031 --> 09:27.979
think he's ever driven through any city in this 
country where you could say they have finished i

09:00.031 --> 09:27.979
mean there will always be redevelopment the 
reconstruction of buildings replacement of

09:00.031 --> 09:27.979
housing but essentially most of the development 
will will have occurred by the year 2027

09:28.651 --> 09:35.740
We have a very definite plan year by year, unit by 
unit. You asked about the strategy for developing

09:35.820 --> 09:39.605
it. We have an economic model that we update 
annually that looks forward and takes into

09:39.705 --> 09:46.835
account changes since we last did it. Is that 
in-house? Is that done in-house? We do it with some

09:50.119 --> 09:57.088
outside consulting help, but it's an in-house 
document that we produce our own. planning

09:57.305 --> 09:58.926
purposes. And we don't publish that. Do you see 
this kind of expansion of population growth and so

10:00.868 --> 10:14.220
forth as being a threat or a great difficulty in 
continuing to manage the environment and the

10:00.868 --> 10:14.220
quality of life type situation? Or do you feel 
quite comfortable that can be accommodated? I

10:16.402 --> 10:19.825
think it can be accomplished, but it's becoming 
more complicated. You know, I think the 1990s is

10:19.925 --> 10:24.609
going to be the decade of the environment. We see 
things like concerned about hazardous waste

10:27.224 --> 10:55.543
endangered species the wetlands the Clean Air Act 
all of those things are going to come to bear and

10:27.224 --> 10:55.543
frankly I don't think in the future you're going to 
see very many large-scale communities like the

10:27.224 --> 10:55.543
woodlands undertaken in the future for those very 
reasons there's so much uncertainty over the life

10:27.224 --> 10:55.543
span of developing a community like this that You 
deal with a lot of uncertainties, a lot of risk

10:55.743 --> 11:00.028
involved. You have so much front-end investment 
that you have to recoup out of the assumption of

11:00.688 --> 11:07.916
later development. Q And, Shane, are there any 
more government initiatives in that direction

11:07.936 --> 11:11.580
that you would like to see? THE PRESIDENT. No, I 
don't think you probably will. I think the

11:14.784 --> 11:24.855
government involvement should be one of 
providing incentives and not providing

11:14.784 --> 11:24.855
roadblocks. Actually, some people look at the 
Woodlands as a government-sponsored community.

11:34.680 --> 11:41.008
We borrowed $50 million to start the development 
of the Woodlands, but we're paying that back. That

11:41.048 --> 11:41.669
was a loan. That was not a gift from heaven. It was a 
little lower interest rate, but when you add to it

11:45.674 --> 11:55.787
all the administrative costs of monitoring that 
for the government and reporting and the hassle

11:45.674 --> 11:55.787
you go through, I'm not sure it was a A good bargain. 
George Mitchell will tell you it was a tremendous

11:57.284 --> 11:59.908
bargain. But I lived over here working on those 
reports that had to go in. And there was a cost

12:03.472 --> 12:06.035
attached to that. But I think the environment is 
going to be a great challenge in the future. We, I

12:12.083 --> 12:14.346
think, tried to address it very well. And I think 
we've done a pretty good job of it. But I think there

12:16.949 --> 12:25.099
are going to be more and more rules and regulations 
promulgated without a clear understanding of the

12:16.949 --> 12:25.099
impact It's going to cause uncertainties and 
delays. And the delays are the money. And when you

12:32.929 --> 12:36.513
get one of these started, you really need to move 
along with it. You can't have periods of time when

12:36.533 --> 12:42.359
you do nothing. What projects are you really 
devoting most of your time to right now? Or is there

12:47.285 --> 12:52.470
any kind of, any kind of affinity like that in what 
I'm doing? I'm pretty well involved in all the

12:53.581 --> 12:56.083
projects that are going on. And it's hard in a 
community like this to separate it into a series of

12:56.164 --> 13:02.550
projects. They're all interrelated. Right now, 
this week, we have the formal opening of a new

13:04.572 --> 13:12.360
18-hole golf course designed by Arnold Palmer. 
And we are expanding the country club in a large

13:12.380 --> 13:17.184
amount. What is that opening? It's on the 30th. 
You're invited. Thank you, sir. Come at 11

13:20.908 --> 13:22.930
o'clock. But right now, after being here 15 years, 
a number of our facilities are 15 years old, and we

13:23.585 --> 13:41.046
have had an ongoing refurbishing program, but 
right now it's a little more intensive than it has

13:23.585 --> 13:41.046
been in the past. We've renovated the conference 
center, updated the guest rooms, enlarging the

13:41.647 --> 13:52.039
country club, separating the conference center 
from the country club, so there are two separate

13:41.647 --> 13:52.039
entities over there. We're enlarging the golf 
facilities because the membership has grown

13:52.610 --> 13:58.179
tremendously. We're engaged in, continually 
engaged in this economic development program and

13:59.541 --> 14:09.817
encouraging businesses to locate here. And the 
main thrust of Madigan would be, right now, is in

14:09.837 --> 14:19.832
the medical area, in the, say, the youth, I'm using 
the umbrella of the Youth and Advanced Research

14:09.837 --> 14:19.832
area. And also well-established companies 
looking for a home. For example, we have the

14:23.932 --> 14:28.760
Products Testing Laboratory for Penzol here, a 
well-established company. Betts Process

14:29.201 --> 14:32.286
Chemical has a major operation here. Up in the 
Trade Center, you may or may not have seen it, it's a

14:32.907 --> 14:44.385
rail-serve trade center and major distribution 
centers there owned by Michelin Tire, Kraft Food,

14:32.907 --> 14:44.385
Eckerd Drug, The distribution outlet for 
McDonald's, as well as Burger King are there. Are

14:50.164 --> 14:51.806
you continuing that expansion? Yeah. As a matter 
of fact, most of our buildings are completely full

14:52.807 --> 14:55.449
there. We have an ongoing program to enhance and 
improve the mobility of the region through the

14:57.331 --> 15:06.781
encouragement of improving highways. We've 
created here in the Woodlands, and I think this is

15:06.801 --> 15:14.068
kind of unique, we've created a commuter van 
system. and also commuter bus parking ride

15:14.673 --> 15:19.240
system. We're outside the service area of the 
Houston Metro, so they could not bring buses into

15:19.820 --> 15:26.891
the woodlands. So we worked through the county and 
got a federal grant, and we built a parking ride

15:26.971 --> 15:34.622
lot, and we financed the buses. It's now being 
operated by Brazos Transit Authority, which is

15:35.041 --> 15:41.253
located in Bryan, I believe. They do a good job. 
Yeah, they do a good job here, too. So we've been

15:45.702 --> 15:53.998
able to take, you know, four, five, six hundred 
cars off the highway by creating alternative

15:45.702 --> 15:53.998
systems for transportation. Is there no internal 
transportation? Would you anticipate ever

15:58.227 --> 16:01.011
having to do something like that? Well, we're 
setting aside right-of-ways and the provision

16:01.031 --> 16:05.097
for that to occur. There's no defined plan to make 
it happen currently. Most of those that have been

16:10.345 --> 16:14.251
attempted have failed. Without some heavy 
subsidy, it's hard to... Even up to Brian, I don't

16:18.757 --> 16:20.640
know. I was wondering about rail service. Do you 
need to keep it there? Do you think you had a

16:22.863 --> 16:27.390
monorail or anything like that in the 
Houston-Dallas connection? Well, that's always

16:27.775 --> 16:42.774
a possibility, and part of the dream that we have is 
there's a plan for this high-speed rail from

16:27.775 --> 16:42.774
Dallas to Houston and to San Antonio. And there are 
a couple of alternate routes for that. Both are to

16:45.697 --> 16:48.941
the west of the Woodlands. They would not come 
through the Woodlands. So I don't think we'd be

16:50.403 --> 16:57.512
exposed to that opportunity, but we do have a rail 
system here at the front door. And there's great

16:58.420 --> 17:08.629
debate in the city of Houston, as you know right 
now, about heavy rail, whether or not to have it,

16:58.420 --> 17:08.629
and if so, where, and who pays for it. If, as you 
commented, the 90s become the decade of the

17:09.089 --> 17:22.481
environmental movement, highway building, if 
it's pursued logically, would diminish, I would

17:09.089 --> 17:22.481
think. Go ahead. Alternative, as you suggested, 
alternative transport modes would have to then

17:27.935 --> 17:30.919
Yeah, I think you're going to see those pressures. 
I think you're exactly right. With respect to the

17:33.703 --> 17:47.802
specific question about rail, I don't think 
that's in the immediate 10-year horizon just

17:33.703 --> 17:47.802
because of cost and time to build it, who owns it and 
how it operates. There are a lot of questions that

17:48.503 --> 17:56.895
need to be answered about rail before it's 
implemented anywhere in the Houston region, I

17:48.503 --> 17:56.895
think. Great debate about that thing. What about 
recreation as an economic investment? That's a

18:11.943 --> 18:12.744
good question. That's a good question. Back when I 
got started in the real estate development

18:15.167 --> 18:26.562
business, developers typically built golf 
courses to help sell land and then hope they didn't

18:15.167 --> 18:26.562
lose too much money and usually gave it away to The 
members, if they would take it or sell it to someone

18:26.913 --> 18:38.886
for a small number of dollars, Club Corporation of 
America became wealthy by taking over clubs that

18:26.913 --> 18:38.886
developers didn't want, didn't know how to run, or 
that members couldn't operate. Today, that's

18:39.767 --> 18:40.788
changed. Golf is a business, and it's a profitable 
business. And we have, we just finished a study

18:46.114 --> 18:51.039
looking at golf meets in the woodlands. Right now, 
we have four 18-hole golf courses. One of them is a

18:54.554 --> 18:58.939
tournament players course, which is in fact a 
day-to-day course. You don't have to be a member to

18:59.620 --> 19:01.942
play. We have one course for the conferees who 
visit the conference center for recreational

19:01.962 --> 19:07.869
purposes. And we have two 18-hole courses set 
aside for country club membership. And we had the

19:13.355 --> 19:20.022
firm by the name of Real Estate Research 
Associates of California do a comprehensive

19:20.643 --> 19:28.595
study course looking at the total golf needs and 
demands throughout the life of the Woodlands. And

19:28.615 --> 19:33.322
in total we need 10 golf courses in the Woodlands, 
10 18-hole golf courses. But we need six more than

19:33.342 --> 19:35.646
we have today. And that would be a combination of a 
second tournament players course, which we have

19:36.407 --> 19:48.085
the right to build, a 36-hole daily feed course, a 
public course, for those who cannot afford or

19:48.858 --> 19:51.963
choose not to belong to a country club. And then a 
more exclusive country club than the one we have

19:52.704 --> 20:04.782
today, a higher-end club, maybe an equity club 
where the members would own that. We're combining

20:04.802 --> 20:15.979
that now with our land planning for the remaining 
portions of the woodlands to make sure we set aside

20:04.802 --> 20:15.979
enough land in the right place to accommodate 
those golfing needs. Is the skiing operation

20:16.297 --> 20:23.867
under your surveillance also? Is it all the ski 
lines or skiing lifts in Colorado? Yeah. We've got

20:28.453 --> 20:33.140
all the real estate falls under- Within the 
corporation? Yeah. We've got two parcels of land

20:33.901 --> 20:42.372
in Colorado, one between Aspen and Snowmass, and 
one at Simbo Springs. The regulatory environment

20:42.925 --> 20:45.830
up there is a morass. You have the Forest Service. 
Yeah, dealing with everybody. Forest Service is

20:49.495 --> 20:56.306
the one who grants permits, but you deal with 
everyone who chooses to deal with you. But in the

20:57.207 --> 21:10.688
area between Aspen and Snowmass, we have 
developed about 800 acres of land and have sold

20:57.207 --> 21:10.688
lots to individuals who have built homes. And 
that's in the very beautiful Owl Creek Valley that

21:11.461 --> 21:19.769
extends the entire distance from the town of Aspen 
to the town of Snowman. And in Steamboat Springs,

21:19.789 --> 21:27.636
we have 3,000 acres of land that we own jointly with 
a third party. And there we're actively trying to

21:28.517 --> 21:33.901
get a permit to build a ski mountain. And that one 
will take on a different character from what we

21:33.921 --> 21:40.067
have in Aspen. has been very low density. The only 
thing that, you know, recreation can tie in nicely

21:42.630 --> 21:53.244
with your quality of life and with the impact on 
your medical care, atmosphere, and even with the

21:42.630 --> 21:53.244
environment. The jogging path. Yeah. You asked 
about other recreational things here in the

21:56.609 --> 22:00.374
Woodlands, and you mentioned jogging paths. 
That's probably the single most popular

22:01.035 --> 22:05.261
recreational amenity we have. We have 53 miles of 
pathway. And it's off the $20 a foot to build that.

22:16.578 --> 22:17.299
Is that your cost? $10,000 a month. $10,000 a 
month. Forget the number. $5 to $10 million

22:24.709 --> 22:28.274
invested in this pathway. I mean, that's 
tremendous investment in a recreational

22:28.294 --> 22:32.359
facility. But it's used by everybody. Kids on 
bicycles, people out for exercise. people both

22:38.587 --> 22:47.440
jogging and riding bicycles and actually 
commuting in some cases from home to school and

22:38.587 --> 22:47.440
from home to shopping. We've got some of the 
retirement communities located close to the

22:48.843 --> 23:00.861
shopping center and you see people in wheelchairs 
walking down and moving down the pathway to go to

22:48.843 --> 23:00.861
the grocery store. So it's kind of a nice feel to it. 
We have a swimming athletic center which is

23:07.983 --> 23:35.847
olympic quality in terms of its facility as a 
matter of fact olympic tryouts are held there and

23:07.983 --> 23:35.847
we're in the process of enlarging and upgrading 
that currently i think in uh summary i really take

23:07.983 --> 23:35.847
up how much time you wanted to give us but um i still 
got a couple questions okay you go ahead well one of

23:07.983 --> 23:35.847
the things which you started and we got distracted 
away from you mentioned some of the things that in

23:07.983 --> 23:35.847
the future

23:37.413 --> 23:40.237
not that they worry, but the things you're 
planning to do. The other side of that coin is, what

23:41.760 --> 23:48.290
are the future incentives or the initiatives that 
you perceive? Are there future initiatives? Is it

23:49.772 --> 23:58.385
going to be business as usual, or are there other 
initiatives that the Woodlands is going to

23:49.772 --> 23:58.385
develop in the next two, three decades? Well, 
yeah, there are very specific things that we need

23:58.405 --> 24:03.753
to develop in the next several decades. One is Town 
Center. Town Center is well defined on paper,

24:07.366 --> 24:11.209
still defined if you try to find it. But it will 
include about 17 million square feet of office

24:11.229 --> 24:23.300
space, which is equivalent to the downtown of 
probably Cincinnati, if you measure it in square

24:11.229 --> 24:23.300
footage. But it will include a regional shopping 
mall, and it will be the urbanized center for

24:23.320 --> 24:29.205
Northeastern. Not only the urbanized center for 
Woodlands, but we look at that as a focal point for

24:29.225 --> 24:36.732
business in Northeastern. The termination of the 
Hardy Toll Road is on I-45. It's the intersection

24:39.491 --> 24:50.461
of some major east-west roadways under design and 
partially under construction, and it will be the

24:39.491 --> 24:50.461
center of population for more than a million 
people. So we look at that as a big item on our agenda

24:51.322 --> 24:58.548
for the next 10 to 15 years. We look at the research 
forest only at its beginning stages right now, and

24:58.568 --> 25:05.554
we would hope we would have 15,000, 20,000 jobs in 
the research forest over the next 20 years, and in

25:05.956 --> 25:22.017
fact do things like have been done in the research 
triangle of North Carolina or around the Stanford

25:05.956 --> 25:22.017
and the Silicon Valley or Route 128 in Boston. So 
that's a long-term goal and objective. We work on

25:24.781 --> 25:32.571
it every day, and we try not to lose sense of 
direction of where we're trying to get to and be

25:24.781 --> 25:32.571
discouraged if we haven't gotten there as quickly 
as we'd like. Those are two very big elements.

25:37.550 --> 25:55.837
Beyond that, the continuation of a quality 
residential program on the remaining lands in the

25:37.550 --> 25:55.837
woodlands that continues to provide housing 
opportunities for the secretary and the clerk and

25:37.550 --> 25:55.837
the grocery store as well as the chairman of the 
board. All done in a tasteful way. Neighborhoods

25:57.839 --> 25:59.201
that are close together. So you get this social 
intermixing of it. school level anyway other

26:02.875 --> 26:32.022
schools where you don't have an elitist side of 
town and a poor side of town so that's an objective

26:02.875 --> 26:32.022
that we had from the beginning and we still pursue 
we have a couple of major lakes we'd like to build in

26:02.875 --> 26:32.022
the woodlands for recreational purposes and 
that's going to take some regulatory approval

26:02.875 --> 26:32.022
governmental health and things like that but 
that's part of the mission that we look at it as

26:32.423 --> 26:36.169
being important to us. Let me answer a couple of 
specific questions. My brother's a city manager

26:38.973 --> 26:40.856
in Las Vegas. He's been doing that for more than a 
dozen years. I called him several months ago, or

26:44.862 --> 26:52.373
actually a better part of a year ago, when we first 
started kicking around with the tickets. Well,

26:53.028 --> 27:02.939
over the years I've talked to them, I'm completely 
at sea when it comes to the niceties or the

26:53.028 --> 27:02.939
crudities, however you want to look at it, of 
running a community. Both definitions are right.

27:05.181 --> 27:07.423
You mentioned that the Woodlands is 
non-incorporated. That's right. Will it be?

27:09.606 --> 27:15.011
Well, let me give you the legal side and then maybe 
the practical side, a little background. Right

27:15.872 --> 27:17.975
now we have a community association. We were 
formed when the Woodlands was created. and is

27:21.665 --> 27:28.551
supported financially by assessments applied 
against all the properties that have been

27:21.665 --> 27:28.551
developed in the area. And it has about a $6 million 
budget now. And it provides all the municipal

27:31.253 --> 27:49.950
services that the city would provide, including 
the fire department, the collection of garbage,

27:31.253 --> 27:49.950
the street escape maintenance, neighborhood 
watch programs, emergency medical services,

27:31.253 --> 27:49.950
street lights, mowing grass, maintaining the 
parks and pathways. does everything the city

27:50.386 --> 27:51.687
would do. And the outlook is for that mechanism to 
continue until one of two things happens. The

28:01.477 --> 28:11.848
woodlands become separately incorporated in the 
city, or it's incorporated into the corporate

28:01.477 --> 28:11.848
boundaries of the city of Houston. And under 
current state law, the woodlands is in the

28:11.908 --> 28:18.975
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city of 
Houston. the city of houston has the right and

28:19.934 --> 28:44.203
authority to annex the woodlands anytime it would 
like to do that as a practical matter i don't think

28:19.934 --> 28:44.203
they will for another year for a couple reasons one 
we're not contiguous to the existing boundaries

28:19.934 --> 28:44.203
of the city of houston and they would have to step 
over a lot of the land that would not be in their

28:19.934 --> 28:44.203
corporate boundaries and two they're not going to 
annex the woodlands as long as there's a

28:44.622 --> 28:49.510
significant debt existing in the municipal 
utility districts that have been created to

28:44.622 --> 28:49.510
provide utilities. The way to let that is to pay 
down. I would think that over the next 20 years,

28:54.117 --> 29:06.117
unless state law changes, that Woodlands will 
become part of the community. Are you, is that

29:06.137 --> 29:10.544
part, is that an assumption built into your 
strategic plan? Yes. Okay. I'll go on to say, too,

29:12.618 --> 29:24.732
that if you took a vote in the Woodlands today, 
there'd probably be 90% of the people who would

29:12.618 --> 29:24.732
choose not to be in the city of Houston and maybe 10% 
who would. So it would not necessarily be a popular

29:25.653 --> 29:29.677
decision. But when you think about it on a regional 
basis and you step aside from the selfish, what's

29:29.697 --> 29:39.148
best for me, question, Cities up in the 
northeastern part of the country and other parts

29:39.601 --> 29:53.818
of the country have been choked, small 
incorporated cities surrounding them, people,

29:39.601 --> 29:53.818
productive people moving out of the inner city, 
living and paying taxes in these small

29:39.601 --> 29:53.818
incorporated areas. And the central city has no 
tax base or declining tax base to provide social

29:54.539 --> 30:08.595
services, the airport, the library, the museum, 
the streets that lead to the jobs where people

29:54.539 --> 30:08.595
work. And philosophically, George Mitchell felt 
that the city of Houston needed to have the ability

30:09.453 --> 30:23.414
to continue to annex land and grow as it could 
provide services for those areas. So by contract,

30:23.434 --> 30:26.618
the Woodlands is included in ETJ. It was not 
geographically situated to be included in ETJ,

30:26.698 --> 30:37.975
but by contract, it is now included in ETJ, the city 
of Houston. Isn't that, I mean, a lot of what you

30:39.001 --> 30:45.629
said, you know, where you could go, well, one, does 
the community in fact know that? Yes. They do know

30:46.470 --> 30:47.671
that. Isn't that then a potential source of some 
grievous conflict in the future? Yes. Which

30:54.940 --> 30:58.244
means, I mean, what's going to happen? Well,

30:58.704 --> 31:07.995
right now the approach, and I think the realistic 
response is that nothing is going to happen for a

31:08.313 --> 31:37.611
period of time the city of houston is not going to 
annex the woodland for a period of time you know

31:08.313 --> 31:37.611
likelihood if it's a sleeping dog that's going to 
wake up well it slept in a place called clear lake

31:08.313 --> 31:37.611
city until the residents there challenged the 
system and under state law an area can if it wants to

31:08.313 --> 31:37.611
separately incorporate first has to ask the city 
in whose ETJ it resides to annex them. And if the

31:44.938 --> 31:48.823
city refuses to do that, then they can 
unincorporate. The Clear Lake City asked the

31:48.843 --> 31:53.790
question, and they were annexed into the city of 
Houston. And that was not a pleasant set of

31:53.810 --> 31:58.296
circumstances. It existed for a number of years. 
As you look around Houston, Every major

32:02.971 --> 32:06.735
large-scale community is an ETJ in the city of 
Houston. It's not unique to the woodlands. No, I

32:07.697 --> 32:08.798
know that. So wherever you locate around the city 
of Houston, you're faced with the same issue. So

32:14.925 --> 32:17.328
it's not a unique woodlands question. It's a 
regional issue. But the distinction is, I mean,

32:21.814 --> 32:32.286
forgive me, but the distinction is those 
communities,

32:21.814 --> 32:32.286
this is a corporation running a community. You 
know, that isn't happening. Kingwood is, too. Oh,

32:35.788 --> 32:36.309
is it? Mm-hmm. Fair Lake City is, too. Oh, because 
what I would... You know, at least it would be a

32:39.033 --> 32:53.773
nagging headache in the back of my skull that at 
some point, instead of animosity being turned

32:39.033 --> 32:53.773
toward the city of Houston or some other place, 
that I'm going to catch it in my lap, you know. Well,

32:53.913 --> 32:59.280
under the community association that we have 
here, it's a representative form of government.

32:59.300 --> 33:02.104
The residents elect... representatives to serve 
on their behalf on the board of directors that

33:02.371 --> 33:14.590
addresses all of the services and charges for 
those services, the scope of delivering those

33:02.371 --> 33:14.590
services. And in fact, in 1992, the residents will 
control that WCA board, the community

33:14.670 --> 33:24.104
association board, and the developer will no 
longer control that one. So it's not that the

33:24.124 --> 33:29.813
corporation controls the community. the 
residents will control the community. You're in

33:32.380 --> 33:33.922
the middle of that transfer right now. Yeah, 
right. That was my second question. We're in the

33:35.684 --> 33:36.825
transition. That takes place in 1992, and we're 
trying to go through the discussion of trying to

33:37.225 --> 33:47.375
prepare the community for that happening. And 
right now, frankly, there is some confusion. It's

33:52.840 --> 33:57.285
a complicated issue, but most people don't think 
about it day to day. It's not something they deal

33:57.545 --> 33:58.686
with. And then when confronted with the notion 
that something's going to happen, the natural

33:59.122 --> 34:07.570
reaction is, if it's changing, I need to be 
concerned about it. And then they try to learn

34:07.590 --> 34:10.473
quickly what they need to be concerned about. And 
we're going through a very lengthy educational

34:11.034 --> 34:18.321
process now to make sure they don't misunderstand 
that we're the bad guys. Sure. That was my other

34:20.663 --> 34:21.764
question. As the privatization of city 
management... you know, what's your role? How do

34:28.777 --> 34:40.129
you, you know, how will you continue to influence 
or affect the quality of life issues, the

34:28.777 --> 34:40.129
infrastructure that you've worked so hard to 
establish? Well, we hope we put in place a

34:40.149 --> 34:48.997
framework with respect to those areas already 
developed that will last long after the

34:40.149 --> 34:48.997
development is on. That was the, I don't like the 
word scheme, that was the concept. to put in place a

34:55.163 --> 34:59.989
form of quasi-government. Residents would run, 
control, operate, and take care of their own

35:00.009 --> 35:04.295
needs. Our intent is not to be here forever. It just 
probably seems that we will be. We'll be here for a

35:10.062 --> 35:11.204
long time. But in 1992, when this first community 
association control transfers to the residents,

35:22.400 --> 35:31.292
A second community association will be formed to 
carry out the development mission on lands not yet

35:22.400 --> 35:31.292
developed. So we will, in essence, control. We'll 
have the capacity to control the undeveloped

35:33.435 --> 35:43.569
lands with respect to lands already developed the 
residents will control that. So there's a

35:43.589 --> 35:47.054
transfer of control with respect to what's 
already been done. In terms of residential

35:48.336 --> 35:50.719
development, you're about halfway where you've 
No. No, we've got 30,000 people live here, 150,000

35:52.503 --> 36:02.139
or whatever percent that is.

36:05.585 --> 36:07.408
But it's an accelerating phase.

36:09.992 --> 36:15.200
If we don't have eight years of economic hardship, 
maybe we'll move along faster. We're 16 years old

36:15.220 --> 36:16.943
and we've been in the doldrums eight of those 16 
years. So I think our progress has been, I think,

36:19.786 --> 36:24.854
surprisingly good, considering the time that 
we've been here. Well, I think you can see, whereas

36:24.894 --> 36:33.026
the rest of the country has been in relaxation now, 
you've still been pretty active. Let me ask one

36:33.046 --> 36:35.069
last question, and then I'll shut up. And you may 
find this impertinent, but it's something that I

36:35.810 --> 36:45.003
wondered about as I talked with Mr. Richmond, Mr. 
Brown, and now you. What would happen? to the

36:47.483 --> 36:51.750
Woodlands if George Mitchell died tomorrow? 
Well, the Woodlands Corporation is a wholly owned

36:51.770 --> 36:58.821
subsidiary of a public corporation. George, in 
fact, owns 62% of the stock of that corporation,

36:58.861 --> 37:09.798
but it is publicly held and will have an ongoing 
life should something unfortunate happen to Mr.

36:58.861 --> 37:09.798
Mitchell. I'm not privy to how his estate would be 
managed. I would

37:16.643 --> 37:27.033
not expect any great changes over the short term. 
Over a longer period of time, I don't guess I would

37:27.053 --> 37:35.342
be capable of addressing that. There's enough 
framework in the Woodlands, just talking about

37:35.362 --> 37:41.728
the Woodlands itself and the community of the 
Woodlands. There's enough framework here

37:41.748 --> 37:46.633
already in place and enough initiatives in place, 
and it's market vitality has been established to

37:47.069 --> 37:55.101
the point where I think it could have an ongoing 
life beyond Mr. Mitchell. You feel that the

37:55.121 --> 38:02.913
strategic plans you've developed and the 
machinery of those are going to continue on

37:55.121 --> 38:02.913
regardless? Yeah, there may be some modification 
to it, but I've come back to the earlier

38:02.933 --> 38:08.681
statements. What we've tried to do is build fabric 
in the community that gives the community an

38:09.142 --> 38:15.692
ongoing life and set it in place. It's an 
institution that has a life of its own. And it will

38:19.260 --> 38:22.265
be a viable community. You know, a town of 30,000 
people is not a small town. And it's got a lot of

38:26.192 --> 38:33.045
elements in it that are necessary to make it 
function, even if it's reading up others. By 92,

38:33.285 --> 38:39.216
basically, the Woodlands Corporation would be 
another business located in the Woodlands. Well,

38:39.567 --> 38:44.453
except that they'll still be developing. Well, 
we're going to continue to develop. In 1992, you

38:47.096 --> 38:52.022
won't be able to tell any difference visually if 
you drive in here. And if you live here, you

38:52.403 --> 38:56.107
probably won't notice any difference either. 
Legally, there'll be some changes that take

38:57.009 --> 38:59.812
place. But I think with respect to the development 
concept, the quality of what we're doing, the pace

38:59.832 --> 39:08.663
at which we're doing it, the way it's financed, 
It's a

39:09.436 --> 39:24.134
unique opportunity,

39:09.436 --> 39:24.134
a unique

39:09.436 --> 39:24.134
place. It's nice to have a sense of pride in what 
you're doing. I guess the most satisfying things I

39:34.192 --> 39:40.598
can do is not sit here in the office, but 
occasionally on the weekend drive around and see

39:34.192 --> 39:40.598
what's happening. I mean, it's kind of impressive 
when you get out and look at all the things that have

39:40.618 --> 39:44.041
happened. And we get caught up in the fires like 
anyone else. There's a crisis today or a crisis

39:47.584 --> 39:59.194
tomorrow, and we address that, and we like to think 
we always have a long-range vision, but in truth

39:47.584 --> 39:59.194
and in fact, you have daily things that you need to 
do. And it's nice to back away occasionally to

40:02.930 --> 40:08.538
reflect on what has happened and what can't 
happen. And we've got a staff of people who have

40:08.658 --> 40:11.382
been here a long time. That was my next question. 
How do you work? Do you have staff meetings

40:13.304 --> 40:14.746
regularly? Yeah, we have staff meetings and 
planning meetings and meetings on special

40:14.766 --> 40:20.254
issues. But we've got most of our employees have 
been with us 10, 15 years and been working together

40:20.274 --> 40:28.806
as a team for that period of time. We don't have a lot 
of turnover. You don't have to have quite as many

40:33.457 --> 40:37.002
meetings when people have been around that long. 
Everyone knows what they need to do and what's

40:38.104 --> 40:42.630
expected of them. But in managing this process, we 
have a staff meeting once a week where our key

40:42.650 --> 40:58.554
managers get together and talk about the issues 
and try to stay away from numbers and details and

40:42.650 --> 40:58.554
look at the big picture. Then we have specific 
planning meetings in the residential

41:03.730 --> 41:11.801
communities and also in the commercial and retail 
areas. We have staff groups, like Jack provides

41:11.821 --> 41:21.053
advertising and VR services to the operating 
units. Each operating unit doesn't have an

41:21.234 --> 41:25.099
advertising and VR person. We have a centralized 
engineering and construction group. We have a

41:28.664 --> 41:32.148
centralized land planning group. You can have 
Dick Brown, apparently. We have centralized

41:33.937 --> 41:38.963
legal, accounting, and other services. And then 
we have essentially three operating groups. We

41:43.387 --> 41:51.517
have a residential group, we have a commercial 
industrial group, and we have a hospitality

41:43.387 --> 41:51.517
group. Those are the three components of the 
Woodlands community. And then we have another

41:54.540 --> 42:03.690
group that we call Mitchell Southwest that takes 
care of all the properties not in the Woodlands.

42:04.295 --> 42:08.378
40,000 acres of timberland between here and 
College Station. And we have resort properties on

42:08.398 --> 42:15.384
Galliston and on Lake Travis, Lake Livingston. 
And that's taken care of by a separate group.

42:18.307 --> 42:19.168
That's a good summary. I haven't heard that 
before. The stuff that Mr. Mitchell does, the

42:20.969 --> 42:26.614
restoration stuff on Galliston, that's not done 
by you, then? No, we provide the technical

42:26.734 --> 42:30.257
services. That's all his money, all his 
initiative. We have a couple architects that work

42:34.636 --> 42:46.091
in our planning group that help him select 
architects, especially trained in renovation

42:34.636 --> 42:46.091
work. We oversee some of the construction for him, 
and we are reimbursed on a time basis for the work we

42:46.111 --> 42:52.540
provide for him. So that's basically like a 
contractual contract. Yeah, right. But you are

42:56.885 --> 43:02.773
doing the, not fire, what's the point? Point 
Venture? No, that'll be all. Pirates. Pirate

43:06.163 --> 43:07.124
speech and code? Yeah. Yeah, that's not right. And 
there's new activity there, right? Yeah, right.

43:12.389 --> 43:12.509
Right. Several kinds of new activity. One, we're 
developing part of it, and we're in the courthouse

43:13.950 --> 43:17.133
on part of it. We've been trying to get approval to 
develop one little parcel down there for 16 years

43:19.335 --> 43:24.480
now. And it's caught up in emotion and environment 
and local politics. We sure appreciate your time.

43:35.932 --> 43:37.555
Well, thanks for coming by. I look forward to 
seeing what work product you produce here. We

43:41.504 --> 43:43.087
will, too. What is your time frame for? Really 
about six months.
