WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:09.178
So we were down there re-equipping ourselves and 
getting ourselves sorted out, and you don't do

00:02.410 --> 00:09.178
that overnight. We had to get new replacements in, 
and remember you've got to check them out and fit

00:09.538 --> 00:28.941
them into the crews, and some of them may be trained 
for artillery, but you're going to use them for

00:09.538 --> 00:28.941
tank gunners, and my God, you have to do that in a 
hurry, and you never get trained people. to fit

00:30.440 --> 00:35.429
every slot where you've had casualties, so you've 
got to keep training even during battle. And we got

00:36.971 --> 00:53.781
through Thanksgiving all right, and we're still 
working to put this stuff together when

00:36.971 --> 00:53.781
the Ardennes campaign broke out on the 16th of 
December.

00:57.355 --> 01:04.004
A fellow named Hugh O'Farrell, who had the 2nd 
Battalion of the 66th Regiment.

01:08.390 --> 01:13.878
I had the 2nd Battalion of the 67th Regiment.

01:13.898 --> 01:21.509
We were ordered out at midnight on the 16th

01:13.898 --> 01:21.509
to get in the Ardennes Campaign. We went on two 
different columns.

01:29.384 --> 01:47.821
We traveled blacked out all night long

01:29.384 --> 01:47.821
over the icy roads, mud, ice, some rain,

01:29.384 --> 01:47.821
fog.

01:52.305 --> 01:53.746
Blacked out all night long. Show you the 
discipline we had in those units. We never lost a

01:57.930 --> 01:59.391
vehicle. I never lost a vehicle. I don't think Hugh 
lost any. And we're talking about moving hundreds

02:04.490 --> 02:12.417
of vehicles,

02:04.490 --> 02:12.417
armored vehicles, fighting units. Daylight 
came. We

02:13.338 --> 02:25.548
were on the right road. We hadn't lost any 
vehicles. And we continued to move.

02:35.147 --> 02:40.532
And we got into a place called Sine,

02:35.147 --> 02:40.532
Belgium.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.642
I recall we coiled up about two o'clock in the 
afternoon.

02:53.326 --> 03:00.293
And the division commander had sent word out that 
the corps commander wanted us to be in Army

02:53.326 --> 03:00.293
Reserve.

03:04.036 --> 03:12.607
And this didn't suit the division commander at 
all, a guy named Ernie Harmon.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.910
What does it mean to be in Army Reserve? That means 
you move down here now, you don't do any fighting

03:15.050 --> 03:22.900
until I tell you to. Okay. Meantime, the division 
had reconnaissance. The reconnaissance

03:25.984 --> 03:30.550
battalion had gone out screening all the roads in 
the area in which the division was going to occupy,

03:30.867 --> 03:40.916
which was on the main axis of the Germans to 
Antwerp. So we just go grab off that. What the

03:46.741 --> 03:59.372
theater commander and the corps commander are 
saying is, we've got that armored division to

03:46.741 --> 03:59.372
stride their avenue into Antwerp where they're 
going, So we know they ain't gonna get there unless

04:00.652 --> 04:06.561
they knock that armored division out and ain't 
anybody about to do that. That old armored

04:08.825 --> 04:12.690
division's got too damn much experience and too 
much power.

04:17.177 --> 04:25.410
So it

04:17.177 --> 04:25.410
was

04:17.177 --> 04:25.410
four or five o'clock. Things began to get a little 
hazy, you know.

04:34.030 --> 04:42.518
Coming to the road, and this main road, Hugh 
O'Farrell's on one side of it, I'm on the other

04:34.030 --> 04:42.518
side, Bill Whack on the other side. In other words, 
we got this major avenue closed, or blocked. Here

04:48.384 --> 05:03.919
came a sergeant up the road with his, from our 
reconnaissance outpost,

04:48.384 --> 05:03.919
with his dead platoon leader laying across the 
jeep. in front of the jeep and another wounded man.

05:10.208 --> 05:11.330
And, well, what hit you?

05:14.793 --> 05:18.216
Said, a German column moving up this road.

05:21.900 --> 05:28.906
Said, they knocked out our M8 armored car and they 
captured and killed the rest of them. This is all I

05:28.946 --> 05:30.548
could get out.

05:35.438 --> 05:43.611
So the story goes that General Harmon contacted 
the Corps commander and said, here is what's

05:35.438 --> 05:43.611
happened. He said, it's obvious to me that this 
outfit is moving.

05:50.101 --> 05:53.125
And said, by God, I want orders to attack. Collins 
said, you're in Army Reserve and you will continue

06:00.211 --> 06:07.878
to remain in Army reserve and I'll give you orders 
when you are to attack. Is this Jay Lawton? Yeah,

06:09.159 --> 06:14.665
Jay Lawton.

06:14.685 --> 06:26.556
Harmon said a four-letter word

06:14.685 --> 06:26.556
and then called

06:14.685 --> 06:26.556
the two combat commanders Pee Wee Collier had CCA, 
he was a brigadier responsible for Hugh

06:28.612 --> 06:35.820
O'Farrell, and I.D. White, who had CCB, who was our 
brigadier on my side to combat Command B, ordered

06:35.840 --> 06:48.133
us into action. Over Collins Head? Yeah, over 
Collins Head. Told him to go. You know, F himself.

06:55.004 --> 06:56.266
to be attacking anyway. He's going to save you a 
soldier, absolutely.

07:01.352 --> 07:10.383
Well, within the hour,

07:01.352 --> 07:10.383
these two leading battalions that led the 
division down there. So you took your troops? We

07:12.725 --> 07:14.047
deployed them. Both of them deployed them on each 
flank of that road. Within an hour, here they came,

07:19.514 --> 07:23.138
bumper to bumper, just about dark. Bumper to 
bumper. Tanks, about 800 and some odd tanks and

07:24.668 --> 07:30.635
armored vehicles and thousands of men. Second SS 
Panzer Division. A whole division? A whole

07:37.142 --> 07:38.283
division. And what did you have? How many tanks did 
both of you have? I had 56 and you had 56.

07:46.051 --> 07:47.513
What happened? We destroyed every damn one of 
them. Tore them all to hell. killed thousands of

07:53.662 --> 08:02.052
people, their soldiers, and stopped the advance 
of the Ardennes campaign. How? By destruction of

08:04.955 --> 08:06.677
that division. I know. How did you destroy the 
division? With fire, with tank fire and artillery

08:09.420 --> 08:14.205
fire and rifle fire. So you surprised them moving 
on? We not only surprised them, but we had the

08:18.951 --> 08:22.555
stealth there to kill them with. Well, once you 
started shooting, didn't their tanks start

08:25.133 --> 08:30.419
spreading out? Absolutely. They couldn't spread 
out. They were bumper to bumper on this road. And

08:34.865 --> 08:36.507
you had them boxed in on both sides? We had them 
boxed in on both sides. We killed the lead tank and

08:38.069 --> 08:43.175
the rear tanks and the vehicles and then just 
started wading into them. Well, couldn't the

08:45.217 --> 08:46.699
tanks get off the road? Nope. They didn't get off 
the road. They all burned. We didn't wait—well, a

08:51.678 --> 08:57.485
few of them didn't burn, I guess, but most of them 
did. We'd done this before. This is the third time.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.672
So you had them sandwiched in. In other words, you 
had the front and both of the flanks— They were just

09:03.173 --> 09:07.759
like this. Here is a road here coming out of the 
Ardennes campaign. I mean, coming out of

09:14.908 --> 09:16.270
Ardennes. Some wooded area, lightly wooded area. 
I'm on this side here. Hugh O'Farrell is over here.

09:25.326 --> 09:32.780
Those represent a tank company, and this 
represents from here to here about 1,000 meters.

09:35.204 --> 09:41.756
And here we are, and they've got these vehicles, 
one right after the other, real close. They're

09:41.796 --> 09:42.357
moving. They're moving real close. I mean, 10 
meters between vehicles. And sometimes less than

09:48.430 --> 09:49.871
that. And people on them and riding in them and so on 
and so forth. I'm sure we let some get away. But we

09:55.436 --> 09:58.319
just slapped this one out up here. And he started 
hitting in here. And nobody makes a move. They try

10:02.923 --> 10:03.924
to move off. Really, you're killing them. You've 
got 56 tanks just searching. And 56 on this side are

10:08.968 --> 10:11.991
just busting the hell out of them. Plus the 
artillery pounding them.

10:17.386 --> 10:18.588
So it's like a canyon. Yeah, and we did the same 
thing. In which you had control of both sides, and

10:20.511 --> 10:28.183
you hit the first and you hit the last tanks, and 
they couldn't get out of there. That's right. What

10:29.725 --> 10:31.308
are they going to maneuver against? Against you? 
Direct fire into them? Mm-hmm. You see?

10:37.557 --> 10:40.722
We're about 300 to 400 meters off out here. Oh, 
that's all you were on both sides? That's all. 300

10:43.006 --> 10:44.949
to 400 meters, yeah. My goodness. We just sucked 
them in there and killed them. We did that during

10:48.782 --> 10:52.525
the, first time we did that was in St. Louis. Oh God, 
the soldiers had a time down there in St. Louis.

10:58.050 --> 11:02.734
Shot up the finance, division headquarters of the 
finance section and killed a general. I reported

11:04.295 --> 11:05.176
it. And General Brooks was commanding the 
division and General White was a brigadier and

11:07.598 --> 11:15.945
they wanted to get down there and see this, dead 
general. By the time we got down there, this guy was

11:17.744 --> 11:23.951
naked because the soldiers had pulled all his 
beautiful uniform off, you know. What are you

11:25.032 --> 11:27.375
gonna say? So they give me hell. But this 
headquarter, they had a finance truck in there

11:29.978 --> 11:43.974
that got blown up also, and

11:29.978 --> 11:43.974
I think somebody said five or six million dollars 
worth of French francs in there. Come to find out

11:43.994 --> 11:45.055
that That stuff was for real. Soldiers were 
throwing that stuff around all over the place.

11:52.523 --> 11:54.326
Everybody was saying it was no damn good. Come to 
find out later, you're about six million dollars

11:54.546 --> 12:01.216
worth of gold-certified French francs. Well, 
getting back to this and the Ardennes, when you

12:01.236 --> 12:11.751
reported what happened,

12:01.236 --> 12:11.751
what did General Collins have to say? Well, there 
wasn't much he could say. We just destroyed the

12:14.829 --> 12:16.511
division.

12:19.454 --> 12:25.820
I guess after the Ardains campaign was over, 
General Harmon went home.

12:29.904 --> 12:30.745
So they relieved him? He didn't go home. He was 
promoted to take a corps, a corps headquarters,

12:32.427 --> 12:38.953
but he was never given a third star. So, although he 
was a thousand percent right, he won the battle,

12:41.262 --> 12:49.210
but lost the war. You know how that goes. Because he 
defied Collin's order, but

12:53.214 --> 13:06.527
that's where the guy on the ground that knows 
what's going on, you better listen to him.

13:08.532 --> 13:15.859
Wouldn't it have been a shame if we'd have sat there 
with that division and allowed these people to

13:08.532 --> 13:15.859
come up here and deploy and cut us up? How do you 
answer that one? You don't. Well, what did you

13:20.464 --> 13:21.805
think of Collins? I thought he was a weak sister. I 
thought he was similar to some of the other senior

13:27.631 --> 13:35.159
people we had. They were nice guys.

13:38.890 --> 13:45.099
but not cut out to really

13:38.890 --> 13:45.099
fight a war. And I'm sure that General Collins did 
thousands of things right,

13:47.543 --> 14:05.910
but this was a hell of a mistake.

14:08.270 --> 14:16.380
that he didn't want to accept the division 
commander's judgment of what the hell was going

14:08.270 --> 14:16.380
on. So, since I was a part of this, you have personal 
feelings

14:18.163 --> 14:34.564
against the guy who, if his orders had not been

14:38.425 --> 14:41.790
countermanded by the division commander, I might 
not be sitting here. So you get a personal feel on

14:43.292 --> 14:49.842
this thing, which may be good and it may be wrong. 
Did you take any prisoners? I think there were a

14:53.748 --> 14:54.869
few.

15:00.297 --> 15:01.379
I think there were a few. Did you lose any tanks? We 
never lost a man, never had a scratch.

15:10.437 --> 15:15.363
I can give you example after example of that in 
Vietnam. We're going to get to Vietnam later.

15:18.967 --> 15:21.670
Where firepower saves people's lives.

15:27.076 --> 15:36.867
Let's go back now to discuss, well we just finished 
the Ardennes and let's continue on that campaign.

15:40.188 --> 15:50.966
During the Ardennes campaign,

15:40.188 --> 15:50.966
I was wounded again, I guess for the second or third 
time. I was evacuated back to England. What kind of

15:55.853 --> 15:57.957
wound was it? It came from German artillery. I had 
my head outside the tank trying to see and try to

16:01.983 --> 16:06.651
move through the woods. And wooded areas are not 
very conducive for tank operations, but if that's

16:07.660 --> 16:13.631
what you got, that's what you use. And

16:13.671 --> 16:25.331
the German artillery breaking in the trees with 
tree bursts, they cut this finger off and cut it

16:13.671 --> 16:25.331
down. So they were shooting above you with 
fragment shells and spraying you. You see, it was

16:30.070 --> 16:38.301
point detonating fuse and it would be hitting in 
the trees and going off in the trees and the

16:30.070 --> 16:38.301
fragments were coming down. So, your hand and 
glove was laying outside the turret, you know, and

16:39.082 --> 16:50.478
you're trying to move along and conduct a battle 
and it cut this thumb and finger off. It's got some

16:50.738 --> 16:55.605
use left in it, but anyway,

17:02.943 --> 17:13.597
About that time my

17:02.943 --> 17:13.597
gunner took a piece inside the head and killed him 
and I went down then. The loader went over to become

17:13.717 --> 17:25.373
the gunner and I dropped down in the tank to load the 
gun and a round came in and kind of anti-godling, 75

17:26.703 --> 17:35.111
millimeter round, came in the tank and bounced 
around in a turret and pinned this arm against the

17:26.703 --> 17:35.111
wall. And I had on a heavy leather flying jacket, 
wool lined, or this arm would have been totally

17:35.352 --> 17:43.520
knocked off. And that anti-tank projectile, 
tungsten steel that they were shooting

17:44.400 --> 17:56.052
broadsided against it after it had been around, 
lost most of its velocity, but pinned it against

17:44.400 --> 17:56.052
the turret and dropped down. So I just totally lost 
all this, you see. From your elbow down, you had no

17:59.956 --> 18:02.398
feeling whatsoever. Yeah, not at all. And this was 
cut open, and thank God it was cold, you know, and

18:03.039 --> 18:14.450
the blood had been coagulating in my leather 
glove, which had a liner in it. And this anti-tank

18:15.311 --> 18:18.334
shell went right through them? Came through off of 
the angle. Right through, right into the tank?

18:22.378 --> 18:23.659
Right into the tank, yeah. And, uh, So I would find— 
No one was killed? Only my gunner who was killed

18:30.796 --> 18:34.780
from the— Shrapnel. Not shrapnel, shell 
fragment. Shrapnel, you know, is a ball. Right,

18:39.204 --> 18:40.946
right, okay. Okay, so don't you consider yourself 
and your crew pretty lucky that the shell could

18:40.966 --> 18:51.917
purse right into your tank and not kill anyone? 
Yeah, it came in behind the driver. and it was kind

18:56.680 --> 19:20.936
of low, and they came in, and they come up, and they, 
my gunner was already dead, and he had slumped

18:56.680 --> 19:20.936
over, and we were trying to continue the battle 
here because we were receiving a lot of pressure,

18:56.680 --> 19:20.936
and as long as we shoot, it was all right. It hadn't, 
a shell fragment hadn't hurt the tank, and he was

19:20.976 --> 19:24.882
still in good

19:29.468 --> 19:33.933
loading the damn thing, and the loader moved over 
to be the gunner. And the Germans were up in front of

19:35.855 --> 19:39.359
you on the road? Oh, yeah. They were anti-tank 
guns. Yeah. And you were on the lead. 75mm, yeah.

19:47.868 --> 19:49.350
And so you were the first one to get hit? I was the 
first one to get hit. And so what'd you do then?

19:53.935 --> 19:56.097
Well, people moved up. How'd you maneuver the tank 
down? I was still on the radio and people moved up. A

20:00.479 --> 20:09.230
guy named Jim Starr, who had my F company, I told 
him, I said, Jim, move up on the left here and get

20:00.479 --> 20:09.230
through these woods as best you can. Get up here and 
get on the left here and take this damn fire off of

20:09.350 --> 20:13.156
us. I said, I've been hit and you're going to have to 
take command. He said, Roger that, I understand.

20:19.204 --> 20:22.408
So he started moving. bypass my dead tank, of 
course, you see. I was dead in the water. The tank

20:28.961 --> 20:30.002
was finished. So,

20:30.683 --> 20:50.067
the driver

20:30.683 --> 20:50.067
was able to get out and get the dead sergeant out and 
with a loader help get me out and tank for some

20:51.869 --> 20:57.495
reason didn't blow up until we were a hundred yards 
away from it. I don't know what happened. I don't

20:59.638 --> 21:07.587
know whether they shot it and hit it again or what 
happened, but we were getting away from it because

20:59.638 --> 21:07.587
you never know when a fire is gonna start. So you 
were moving back up the road? They were out. We

21:11.271 --> 21:16.057
were, they were carrying the dead soldier and I was 
making it on my own. So Jim Starr was in charge. He

21:22.480 --> 21:23.722
assumed command. And so did Starr and the rest of 
the tanks, did they knock out these? Went ahead and

21:29.390 --> 21:30.572
cleaned them out. Outflanked them then? 
Outflanked them, come in on the flank of them,

21:33.916 --> 21:38.122
killed them, and I just stopped them. And I was 
evacuated to Paris and then to England. And I was

21:45.373 --> 21:52.403
gone about

21:45.373 --> 21:52.403
three or four weeks total time. Came back, 
Ardennes campaign, I was hit on, I

21:53.058 --> 22:09.176
believe it was the first or second of January, and 
the campaign was over on about the 13th. Second

22:11.379 --> 22:18.627
Army Division moved up north of Hawkin,

22:11.379 --> 22:18.627
and I stole away from the hospital. I went AWOL from 
the hospital and went to England. I went to

22:28.287 --> 22:48.630
Heathrow, caught an airplane to Orly Field in 
France, hitchhiked into Paris,

22:28.287 --> 22:48.630
went to the rear area transportation and asked for 
transportation to go back up to the front. Ended up

22:50.230 --> 22:59.020
by riding with a black sergeant who was leading a 
red ball truck company up that night. We left at

22:59.200 --> 23:00.382
midnight. We spent all night and got into the edge. 
When I got into the edge, I got the field telephone

23:05.628 --> 23:11.775
of one of the units there, one of the supply units. 
And I called on the line at division rear

23:13.457 --> 23:19.444
headquarters. I got the headquarters. My 
battalion sent a jeep for me and picked me up in

23:22.315 --> 23:28.582
Liege and I was back in my outfit in command. Why'd 
you go AWOL? Why didn't you wait until you got

23:29.903 --> 23:31.345
orders? I was afraid I might lose my unit, you know, 
if you'd gone very long. You're gone more than 30

23:36.250 --> 23:40.654
days until I would get another guy to command your 
unit. What were you gone? Three weeks? I'd gone

23:43.497 --> 23:45.179
about three weeks. Did the doctors want to keep you 
there? They wanted me to keep me on. As a matter of

23:49.732 --> 23:57.719
fact, they threatened to send me to the United 
States, and I didn't want any part of that. So I— How

23:59.061 --> 24:03.004
was your arm by that time? Well, I was doing—this is 
still, you know, it's just dead out there. It's

24:11.772 --> 24:14.555
just there, but it's better than nothing. Good 
thought. Yeah, and it hadn't healed up, of course.

24:18.132 --> 24:20.836
But it was coming along, no infection. It moved the 
stitches out of it. And how was the rest of your arm?

24:24.941 --> 24:30.790
Well, this was still black, and they were having me 
put it in. They were working it every day, a

24:31.330 --> 24:34.294
physiotherapist. It got to where it didn't hurt me 
any, but you know, it's still black from where it

24:34.955 --> 24:40.984
got squashed. So I decided that I could make it, and 
I just got out of there. Did you think about your

24:48.271 --> 24:51.434
career at that time? Yeah, that's what I was 
thinking about. I didn't want to lose my command. I

24:56.779 --> 24:59.681
didn't want to lose my unit and the war wasn't over. 
But going AWOL, that certainly might not help your

24:59.701 --> 25:06.087
career in the long run. Well, that's true, but I 
just had to take a chance on that. I just had to take a

25:10.351 --> 25:11.652
chance on that. And you were just eager to get back 
in the combat? I wanted to get back in my unit. In

25:15.316 --> 25:16.377
your command. In my command, so... I never thought 
much about my career then. I was just thinking

25:20.847 --> 25:24.993
about my unit and trying to stay alive, you know. 
And so when you got back, what did your commanding

25:25.714 --> 25:28.639
officer have to say? Oh, my God, he was happy as 
hell. Oh, he was? Yeah.

25:36.271 --> 25:38.214
Did you tell him that you went over the hill? I told 
him that I'd had transportation between London

25:46.709 --> 25:52.719
and Paris were such, and the hospital, that I 
didn't have time to check out. So if there's any

25:52.819 --> 26:00.672
complaints, it's because I just didn't have time 
to really go through all the procedure of checking

25:52.819 --> 26:00.672
out. You've got to understand what you did.

26:08.486 --> 26:10.509
Well, did you ever, never heard a word? Never heard 
a word from it.

26:18.653 --> 26:24.001
So what, did your commanding officer cover for you 
then? Nothing ever come up. I guess that... The

26:26.665 --> 26:28.067
doctors never did anything? Never did a thing, no, 
no. I don't think they really cared, you know. The

26:34.276 --> 26:35.618
guy would get up and leave. They don't know where in 
the hell he goes. Soldiers do the same thing. There

26:40.805 --> 26:47.395
were soldiers noted for running off from the 
hospital and getting back to his unit. He doesn't

26:48.488 --> 26:50.813
want to go join anybody else's unit. He doesn't 
want to get in that replacement system, you know.

26:55.201 --> 27:09.670
So he'll find out that he's gonna be assigned to 
what he called a REPL depot, replacement depot,

26:55.201 --> 27:09.670
you see, where you're a number and you're just 
gonna go here or wherever they need you most. Well,

27:10.207 --> 27:16.013
you just leave the damn hospital and go AWOL and go 
back to your unit. When you tell them that, just

27:16.033 --> 27:21.939
tell them that you're alright and you want to get 
back to your unit. You don't want to go to somebody

27:21.959 --> 27:25.323
else's unit. How had your command done while you 
were away? They had done well. Jim Starr had, from

27:33.091 --> 27:39.437
Gainesville, Texas up here, he had He had taken 
over command of the battalion, he was a captain,

27:40.430 --> 27:53.629
taken over command of the battalion and finished 
off the campaign and then moved the unit up there

27:40.430 --> 27:53.629
and they were getting ready to go again and I walked 
in there a couple of days before. He stepped back

27:54.410 --> 27:59.738
down to his company and took it over and off we went.

28:10.518 --> 28:16.984
We headed out then to the Rhine, I guess.

28:17.004 --> 28:30.117
And I took a town named Krefeld, K-R-E-F-E-L-D,

28:17.004 --> 28:30.117
Krefeld on the Rhine.

28:30.137 --> 28:40.086
And

28:30.137 --> 28:40.086
that was the industrial center in the industrial 
area. Germans mostly, most all of them except some

28:41.669 --> 28:48.378
remnants, had pulled back across the Rhine and 
blown most of the bridges. I had tried to get this

28:49.680 --> 28:56.349
bridge at Krefeld, but they had blown that thing a 
few hours before I got there.

29:02.398 --> 29:09.668
We found out later that there was a failure on the 
Germans' part down south where the 9th Armored

29:02.398 --> 29:09.668
Division crossed.

29:13.529 --> 29:15.932
I believe that's what it was. But we pulled up 
against the Rhine and first thing you know we get

29:18.155 --> 29:38.220
orders to cross at Wessel, W-E-S-S-E-L, and they 
had an airborne drop over there,

29:18.155 --> 29:38.220
about a regimental strength airborne drop over 
there. on the other side while we were bridging it.

29:40.770 --> 29:47.098
We bridged, the 2nd Armored bridged to Ryan the 
vessel in eight hours and 20 minutes. Eight hours

29:47.118 --> 29:50.302
and 20 minutes at dark, after dark. That's 17th 
Combat Engineers of the 2nd Armored Division.

29:55.048 --> 29:57.691
Eight hours and 20 minutes. And I crossed them. And 
I was the lead element, advance guard for the

30:00.254 --> 30:04.039
division. And I headed for Liebstadt and 
Paderborn,

30:05.605 --> 30:17.042
and the 3rd Armored Division crossed down at 
Cologne.

30:20.266 --> 30:25.053
And that division was commanded by Maurice Rose.

30:28.138 --> 30:28.979
He was killed. Mike Gilman, who was there. Their 
advance guard leader was killed.

30:41.591 --> 30:44.855
I never lost a soldier on the north flank in my unit. 
I fought like hell.

30:50.301 --> 30:59.372
Mike Yeoman

30:50.301 --> 30:59.372
is a brother of the football coach at the 
University of Houston.

31:03.554 --> 31:10.080
I can't think of a yeoman down there's name, first 
name now. I can't think, it doesn't matter. But we

31:12.923 --> 31:20.991
finished off after five days and five hard nights 
of, we met at Paderborn, linked up. That's the

31:23.053 --> 31:25.896
heart of Germany, that's still the heart of 
Germany. Whoever takes that has Germany.

31:34.233 --> 31:37.998
I was going to, I had a great disappointment. I was 
going to, I promised the soldiers, I said, we get

31:38.760 --> 31:52.860
this link up here, we closed off some fourteen 
divisions,

31:38.760 --> 31:52.860
and the whole heart of Germany. Great double 
envelopment, historical double envelopment. as

32:01.503 --> 32:09.933
it was a historical meeting engagement back on the 
16th of November.

32:09.953 --> 32:21.988
I had promised my soldiers that they'd get a chance 
to get some rest and we'd get all of our vehicles

32:09.953 --> 32:21.988
refueled and maintenance up on them and ammo and 
all that. All of that was underway. We had coiled up

32:26.153 --> 32:28.236
in a big area. big wagon train area, tank 
battalion, tank battalion, tank battalion,

32:28.790 --> 32:41.769
infantry battalion with each tank battalion, 
artillery in the middle ready to shoot in any

32:28.790 --> 32:41.769
direction, scout reconnaissance out all the way 
around. We brought in fuel and ammunition and some

32:42.751 --> 32:48.640
food and water and that sort of thing. The mail, 
which they hadn't seen. And we were gonna get all

32:53.947 --> 32:57.733
that maintenance done and then we were gonna good 
night's rest for the first time. We met those

33:02.915 --> 33:20.391
people about two o'clock in the evening and we were 
about finished about five o'clock and it's

33:02.915 --> 33:20.391
beginning to get gray and dusk and soldiers were 
thinking about going to sleep when here comes the

33:02.915 --> 33:20.391
division commander. Who was he? General, now 
General I.D. White. a retired four-star general

33:27.498 --> 33:32.586
now, Norwich graduate, Norwich.

33:36.452 --> 33:36.812
So. Was he a one-star general then? Two. He'd just 
been promoted to two-star. Ernie Harmon left

33:44.303 --> 33:50.012
after the Ardange campaign and he took over the 
division and got promoted.

33:59.543 --> 34:00.865
What did General White have to say? General White 
said, you've got your map? Yes, sir. He said, we're

34:06.732 --> 34:07.954
right here. I said, that's right, sir. He said, 
well, I want you to move

34:11.298 --> 34:20.871
from this point up here. I

34:20.911 --> 34:27.199
said, hell, that's 12 kilometers up there. That's 
right. Well, he said, I want you to jump off here at

34:29.699 --> 34:38.888
midnight,

34:29.699 --> 34:38.888
and the division is going to follow you by six 
hours. And I want you to get a pass through the

34:40.710 --> 34:57.107
Teutoburger Wall at a town named Dentmole, and 
that's a SS collecting point where all the

34:40.710 --> 34:57.107
soldiers, SS soldiers that get, units get beat up 
and so on and forth, they all

35:00.698 --> 35:02.620
They were reorganized into other units. He said, I 
want you to take that pass and that mall and have

35:03.821 --> 35:17.917
that all cleared out because the whole division is 
going to follow you

35:03.821 --> 35:17.917
by six hours. You're going to jump off at midnight, 
and we're going to start moving at six.

35:26.006 --> 35:26.166
Goddamn. I said, my soldiers haven't had any rest 
or anything.

35:33.677 --> 35:41.828
He said, say again, once you're here at midnight, 
the division's going to follow you by six hours.

35:45.232 --> 35:46.494
And I said, roger that. So I called Lieutenant 
Drake, who had the reconnaissance company that

35:48.176 --> 35:53.743
was attached to me. I said, Drake, five o'clock.

36:05.752 --> 36:08.535
here at midnight. I get some scouts quick on the 
goddamn road and understand that this is an

36:08.555 --> 36:13.980
uncleared area. Uncleared. So the enemy could be 
right there? The enemy could be all over it, you

36:18.805 --> 36:21.147
understand that? He said, Roger, sir, and I said 
report to me every 30 minutes by radio. Roger that.

36:29.155 --> 36:30.617
He said, I'll send Sergeant Happy. Sergeant Happy 
got killed the next day. No, two days later, but he

36:35.165 --> 36:39.409
said, okay. Sergeant Happy was replacing a 
lieutenant because he didn't have enough

36:39.509 --> 36:48.137
lieutenants in reconnaissance, so he took a 
reconnaissance platoon. Sergeant Happy took off

36:49.918 --> 37:03.771
and he reported, and Break, Lieutenant Break, a 
company commander, was following back behind,

36:49.918 --> 37:03.771
moving along, posting some guides. very helpful 
that night. If you got to be at some place at some

37:06.826 --> 37:14.035
specific point at that time, you got to know where 
you're going. Well, everything worked well, and I

37:14.055 --> 37:33.640
got on that damn thing, and I figured we were going 
to have to move about 10 o'clock, and I didn't want

37:14.055 --> 37:33.640
to stop, but by the time we got the orders out, and 
everybody zeroed in, and so on and forth, it was, we

37:14.055 --> 37:33.640
didn't have any spare time, so we started moving 
in, and got up here a few minutes ahead of time, and I

37:35.932 --> 37:41.998
just proceeded to continue to move. We ran into 
Army headquarters during the night. German?

37:49.124 --> 37:49.664
Germans. We caught German tank crews with tanks 
guarding the road that we were on asleep. They were

37:56.611 --> 37:57.672
exhausted too. Yeah, and we used the old piano wire 
method, you know. Do you know what I'm talking

38:00.695 --> 38:02.116
about? Take a piece of piano wire about three feet 
long. You put a hand grenade ring on each end of it

38:07.437 --> 38:12.444
that fits in your finger. A hand grenade ring, you 
know, it pulls the piano out of your hand and it's

38:12.465 --> 38:16.190
very strong. And so, you catch a guard out there 
halfway asleep or something, or asleep on the

38:17.973 --> 38:33.597
ground, you just put that piano wire over there and 
cross it and pull it up on his neck, you know, and you

38:17.973 --> 38:33.597
can kill him without him ever making a squawk. and 
that's what you have to do. So we did the lead

38:37.604 --> 38:40.368
elements. I was with the lead recon platoon all 
night, everybody moving along. Ran into this

38:46.257 --> 38:47.438
headquarters. I called back on the radio to my rear 
area. So you were in the lead? I was up front. You

38:55.711 --> 38:59.376
were in the lead jeep then, or you were in the lead 
tank? I was in the lead jeep behind the recon

38:59.737 --> 39:03.482
platoon. Okay, and the recon platoon, what did 
they have? Jeeps. Yeah, jeeps, that's all. All

39:10.048 --> 39:11.830
jeeps, yeah. And you guys were driving up and 
catching these guys asleep? At night. Or were you

39:16.436 --> 39:17.858
walking up? At night. They were so tired that they 
didn't even hear you driving up? No. You know, a

39:23.565 --> 39:25.588
jeep's fairly quiet. We come into an area that you 
just, obviously, you know, there's some activity

39:26.193 --> 39:30.917
here. You can see some lights flickering over 
there. That's not German houses because the

39:33.079 --> 39:36.323
Germans would shoot them, you know. That's the 
military. So we ran into this one army

39:39.265 --> 39:45.731
headquarters and it was about 300 yards off the 
road. The tank crews on guard there were asleep. We

39:51.857 --> 39:52.858
knocked them off. Would you have 50 calibers on the 
Jeep? 50 calibers. 50 calibers or 30 calibers.

40:00.677 --> 40:09.326
Usually a 30 caliber is mounted down there, but 
sometimes you have a pedestal mount with a 50

40:00.677 --> 40:09.326
caliber up there because it gives you some pretty 
heavy stuff. And we use armor-piercing rounds in

40:11.708 --> 40:17.454
it too to clean up thin-skinned vehicles and 
stuff. Anyway, this is obviously the big

40:17.474 --> 40:21.158
headquarters. They had generators running, you 
know, and lights and tents, and you could see them

40:22.268 --> 40:28.379
flickering in and out and so on and forth. And I 
called back and said, at this point, you're going

40:28.439 --> 40:35.091
to find a tank there, but don't worry about it.

40:38.357 --> 40:45.930
The crew is dead, and it's right opposite an Army 
headquarters here, or headquarters of that

40:38.357 --> 40:45.930
magnitude, because it had about We were able to 
identify there about 10 or 15 big Buick sedans,

40:46.940 --> 40:59.033
Mercedes and Buick sedans, so that's typical.

40:59.053 --> 41:05.760
A little parcel of land I paid $900 an acre for and 
selling it for $2,500. Really? Where's that? Down

41:08.483 --> 41:15.630
in the old country in Kerr County, north of San 
Antonio. Gee, that's too bad. Well, I'll tell you

41:23.022 --> 41:24.464
what.

41:28.690 --> 41:38.322
Ms. H., since I had this cancer, she's a little 
upset about us having properties in Montana and

41:28.690 --> 41:38.322
South Carolina.

41:41.646 --> 41:45.972
You were discussing moving in. to the German 
headquarters and you were radioing back. Yeah,

41:51.116 --> 42:00.468
well during that night

41:51.116 --> 42:00.468
we ran through all types of different 
installations. And you got to this German

42:01.249 --> 42:03.912
headquarters and now you were radioing back. 
Yeah, I was radioing back telling them you had to

42:03.932 --> 42:14.305
keep everybody advised and up to date because you 
didn't want some tank driver coming along there

42:03.932 --> 42:14.305
that might be inclined to be frightened and see 
this German tank there and start shooting and

42:14.842 --> 42:33.762
create a disturbance in your rear area or the 
middle of your element when you're using as much

42:14.842 --> 42:33.762
stealth as possible during the night and being as 
careful as you can because you The one thing that

42:34.400 --> 42:59.635
worries you most, I think, during the night, 
movement and fighting during the night, is that

42:34.400 --> 42:59.635
you keep track of where you are because you don't 
want to be on the wrong road the next day when a

42:34.400 --> 42:59.635
division is following you and you've cleared one 
road, but it just so happened that you were on the

42:34.400 --> 42:59.635
wrong road and they're going on another road that 
hasn't been cleared. So that's disaster. So

43:02.294 --> 43:05.477
that's what I think you worry about most of during 
the night. But anyway, I had a funny thing happen

43:05.497 --> 43:07.700
there. I called my headquarters commandant in the 
rear of my column, and I said, when you pass this

43:07.760 --> 43:28.521
particular area here, I said, I'd like for you to, 
since you're at the rear of the column, the combat

43:07.760 --> 43:28.521
elements, I said, I'd like for you to shoot up these 
damn Buick sedans in this Army headquarters over

43:07.760 --> 43:28.521
here. Did you already capture the headquarters? I 
had already captured it, but I said that. And who

43:32.567 --> 43:33.368
was in there? Were there some officers? Well, they 
were running. Oh, hell, they were running off.

43:36.894 --> 43:38.196
Most of them run off on us. We didn't get a handful of 
them. We got a few soldiers. But you drove in there

43:42.763 --> 43:45.548
in your Jeeps. Well, reconnaissance elements 
went in. And you tried to surprise them? Hell, they

43:50.215 --> 43:53.901
were running out all through the dark on us every 
place. And so I just called a guy, a captain back

43:54.421 --> 44:04.353
there at my headquarters, a commandant, and I 
said, when you get up here, blow this stuff up. I

44:04.834 --> 44:11.182
