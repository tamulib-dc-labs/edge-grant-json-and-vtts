00:03.592 --> 00:12.422
It was a dissertation by a fellow who had passed 
away, and his wife had sent it to us and asked us if we

00:03.592 --> 00:12.422
were interested in publishing it. He had worked 
with the Corps of Engineers for many years, and it

00:14.004 --> 00:31.405
was on the subject of the

00:14.004 --> 00:31.405
development of the mouth of the Mississippi 
River, the channelization of the Mississippi,

00:31.823 --> 00:44.102
and opening it up to heavy ship traffic. And that 
was the dissertation, but it was absolutely, it

00:44.122 --> 00:51.914
was like reading a finished book. It wasn't like a 
dissertation at all. It didn't have the usual

00:54.238 --> 01:00.227
dissertation ease and the view of literature and 
notes to every phrase, extremely well written,

01:00.916 --> 01:07.444
and I wanted to publish that. And I was in the middle 
of negotiations with the man's wife and had told

01:07.865 --> 01:14.994
her that we would like to publish it. And she wrote 
to me and said that the Corps of Engineers had

01:15.694 --> 01:23.424
gotten in touch with her and they wanted to publish 
it. And so they did. We missed out on that. I think

01:26.638 --> 01:43.081
that would have been a really good book, and I think 
it would have led us into doing some stuff in

01:26.638 --> 01:43.081
history of technology and southern history, too, 
that we didn't get into until much more recently.

01:45.163 --> 01:51.392
How does an editor attract manuscripts?

01:51.963 --> 01:54.566
You attract manuscripts by publishing good 
books. You find manuscripts by getting out there

01:54.666 --> 02:13.007
and talking to people, going to meetings, talking 
to people on the phone, just talking to people

01:54.666 --> 02:13.007
about their students and who's doing good work and 
about their colleagues and finding out who's got

01:54.666 --> 02:13.007
the manuscripts. And then you make the contact 
with them and ask them if they haven't written a

02:20.870 --> 02:23.734
manuscript yet, if they would consider writing 
one. If they do have the manuscript, have they

02:23.835 --> 02:27.220
presented it to someone else? And if not, could you 
see a proposal on it? Give an example of one that you

02:30.925 --> 02:38.317
recall where that worked, where you did that. Oh, 
that's the standard practice. Practically every

02:42.603 --> 02:48.953
manuscript we get is now something that we either 
have attracted through our previous

02:49.540 --> 03:09.046
publications or that we've gone out and

02:49.540 --> 03:09.046
contacted the author and asked that the author let 
us have a look at it. I do that pretty often in the

03:09.687 --> 03:14.032
Eastern European series. Stepan Nestrovich is 
the series editor, and he and I often contact

03:19.072 --> 03:30.146
people whose work we've heard about and ask them if 
they will

03:19.072 --> 03:30.146
provide us with the prospectus. I've just begun

03:31.348 --> 03:38.978
what we call the Centennial of Flight series. And 
Roger Lanius, the chief historian at NASA, is the

03:40.180 --> 03:46.107
general editor of that series. And he and I have 
actually asked people to contribute books to the

03:48.620 --> 03:53.244
series. And these are people who have done other 
writing in the history of aviation and

03:53.444 --> 03:58.269
aeronautics. And so we don't even have a 
manuscript on that in that series yet, but we have

03:59.470 --> 04:06.116
15 books lined up for it. Everything from the 
man's, humanity's visions and imaginations

04:06.857 --> 04:18.407
about flight long before flight was possible, 
through the light or the air period into the early

04:19.130 --> 04:25.822
years of aviation and right on up to the space age. 
And I'm hoping that whoever takes my place here

04:26.563 --> 04:34.157
will continue that series and working with Roger. 
And maybe there'll be 20 or 25 books in the series

04:34.237 --> 04:42.792
before it's really closed out in about 2004 or 5. 
But we have about 15 titles lined up for it now.

04:51.705 --> 04:55.210
Let's see, I'm now kind of going, heading 
downhill. As you look back over these years, to

04:55.991 --> 05:03.502
which colleagues are you most grateful here on 
staff? Oh, they're all a wonderful team.

05:10.379 --> 05:20.529
I'm really grateful to Gayla Christensen, our 
marketing manager, because she's been my model

05:10.379 --> 05:20.529
for marketing practices and good marketing. I've 
learned a tremendous amount from her over the

05:21.870 --> 05:24.513
years. I

05:25.534 --> 05:38.226
was really grateful to Tom Rotell, because I 
learned a lot of business practices from him. and

05:38.527 --> 06:02.982
learn from him that a university press can be run 
efficiently business-wise and still be a

05:38.527 --> 06:02.982
university press, still publish good scholarly 
work, but university press doesn't have to lose

05:38.527 --> 06:02.982
money on every book it publishes to retain its 
reputation. And in fact, the books that sell well

06:04.092 --> 06:08.598
are often the books that give you a good 
reputation.

06:13.064 --> 06:16.889
Just everybody on the staff, they've all been 
wonderful to work with. Chris and I have been here

06:18.692 --> 06:23.037
25 years, and all our friends are here. We know some 
people in Lubbock, but it's going to be quite

06:24.299 --> 06:28.825
different. Did you, by chance, know Bill Shearer? 
Yes, I did. Describe Bill Shearer for people who

06:32.649 --> 06:35.312
might not know you. Well, Bill Shearer was our 
second sales rep, and he used to travel Texas

06:35.332 --> 06:45.203
visiting all the bookstores and selling the 
press's books in Texas. Bill was an Aggie, and he

06:46.425 --> 06:56.716
was probably the most literate Aggie I ever met. He 
read everything he could get his hands on. He found

07:01.619 --> 07:14.114
time to read when, you know, I often wish that I had 
time to read books, just to sit down with a good book

07:01.619 --> 07:14.114
and enjoy it. Well, Bill found that time. He made 
that time. That time was part of his life. And I just

07:20.381 --> 07:24.486
have never lived books like Bill did. And so he 
worked for us for, I forget how long it was, five or

07:32.078 --> 07:34.461
six years. And one day, I was riding with him on a 
trip, and I said, where do you want to go? What do you

07:44.156 --> 07:46.118
plan to do in this business? And he said, I'm going 
to start my own publishing house. And sure enough,

07:50.505 --> 07:54.671
a few days later, he came in dressed in a suit. You 
didn't see Bill in a suit very often. But I said, why

07:57.897 --> 08:00.840
are you all dressed up? And he says, I'm going to the 
bank. I'm going to talk to them about financing me

08:02.821 --> 08:08.566
my publishing business. And he got the loan. He 
also got support from, oh,

08:11.849 --> 08:27.162
jeez, my memory is going.

08:28.964 --> 08:39.497
fellow in a printer in Austin who had done a lot of 
work for the press, had done a lot of our printing,

08:28.964 --> 08:39.497
especially our big color books. Hart, Bill Hart 
was the name. And Bill Hart had acquired the rights

08:42.661 --> 08:55.377
to Shoal Creek Publishing, which was a little 
fine, high-quality publishing house at Texana.

08:56.032 --> 09:09.648
And so Bill Hart told Bill Shearer that he would 
contribute to Bill's business and become a

08:56.032 --> 09:09.648
partner if Bill would take these Shoal Creek books 
and distribute them and sell them. So Bill did

09:10.449 --> 09:20.540
that, and then he started his own publication 
program and moved to Fredericksburg after a

09:10.449 --> 09:20.540
couple of years here. And Shearer Publishing was 
one of the one of the top Texas literature Texana

09:26.170 --> 09:35.142
publishers in the state for several years for the 
good work that Bill had done. He was in an old beer

09:35.182 --> 09:42.332
hall and dance hall in Fredericksburg. I guess 
their offices are still there. I haven't been over

09:45.537 --> 09:46.999
there in some time. I think so. But his wife Kathy 
now runs the business. Bill passed away a few years

09:51.124 --> 09:55.350
back, and it was a tremendous loss. He was a great 
publisher and he was just an all-around great guy.

10:01.855 --> 10:12.825
Let's see, other people that, are there any 
non-A&M employees, perhaps former students,

10:01.855 --> 10:12.825
that you think have been important to the press? Oh 
yeah, Joe and Betty Moore, John Lindsay,

10:13.085 --> 10:23.194
the more recently,

10:26.566 --> 10:30.710
John

10:26.566 --> 10:30.710
and C.C. Keck down in Laredo. K-E-C-K. Yes. John 
Keck and

10:35.976 --> 10:52.573
we have a series name for them, and I can't even 
think of the name now. I'm getting close to

10:54.308 --> 10:56.011
retirement, I guess. What is the common factor in 
those folks? What causes them to be? Well, they

11:02.560 --> 11:04.243
love books. They love publishing. I know John 
Lindsay's case, he was just so excited that his

11:07.187 --> 11:20.147
university could have its own publishing 
operation. I was going to say, is the fact that

11:20.515 --> 11:24.159
there's some ruinousness, does that help? Oh, 
yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's very true that Aggies

11:26.401 --> 11:33.830
support their university better than alumni 
anywhere else in the world. And they are the Moores

11:34.691 --> 11:48.125
and the Lindseys and the Kecks and

11:34.691 --> 11:48.125
the other people whose name I can't recall. I'm 
embarrassed to say. have all been real

11:50.823 --> 11:53.686
supportive. And then a lot of other people, too, 
just people like John Adams. We're publishing his

11:59.993 --> 12:02.776
third book. He's written The History of the Corps 
of Cadets, and we'll be publishing that. Adams has

12:10.224 --> 12:20.796
done a lot of good work with the press, and he's 
never asked for anything special, no special

12:10.224 --> 12:20.796
consideration.

12:23.510 --> 12:27.417
wants Texas A&M University Press to publish these 
things. What advice as you, now I'm placing you,

12:29.201 --> 12:40.982
you're the consultant, what advice would you give 
to the Texas A&M Press now?

12:42.766 --> 12:47.374
Keep up what it's been doing for the last six years. 
What does that mean? Keep publishing the kinds of

12:50.385 --> 12:58.534
books that it's been publishing and keep its eye on 
the bottom line the way it has been doing. I think

12:59.996 --> 13:05.802
the press could be a little more adventurous in 
some areas that it has funding in. Such as? Well,

13:08.445 --> 13:13.210
like in the revolving funds, use of those.

13:15.603 --> 13:27.275
But I think overall the balance is real good right 
now between the funded books and the unfunded

13:15.603 --> 13:27.275
ones, between the trade books and the scholarly 
books. And I think it's a good opportunity now. If

13:32.861 --> 13:42.150
the press sticks to its knitting and does what it 
has experience of doing, that we can see some

13:32.861 --> 13:42.150
growth from it. in coming years and it can move on up 
into the from 20th to 25th on up into the teens and

13:42.923 --> 13:53.540
maybe even higher in the ranking. I think Charles 
has plans to

13:53.921 --> 14:08.104
move right on up with the university and make the 
press expand and grow. right along with the

14:08.472 --> 14:09.754
university. Are there any new subject areas that 
would be worthy for A&M to consider and impress?

14:20.247 --> 14:22.870
Well, we're trying to get a series in agriculture 
started. We have three books on that. Is that a

14:24.773 --> 14:26.675
good? That's starting, yeah. That's a good 
venture. That's a good prospect. I think the only

14:31.081 --> 14:37.669
other one that

14:31.081 --> 14:37.669
should be considered right now and I think Charles 
is considering it, but I would recommend that he be

14:38.932 --> 14:46.319
very careful about it, is veterinary medicine. 
Because there's a lot of commercial competition

14:47.280 --> 14:49.902
there. But the right kinds of books, I think, this 
press could do in vet medicine or associated

14:50.663 --> 14:56.368
topics. But other than that, I think the press 
ought to hold on developing any new fields for a

14:57.128 --> 15:04.675
while. And the number of titles projected now per 
year? It's about 50 to 55, but it's going on up from

15:10.348 --> 15:14.071
there. Do you think that's a worthy goal? Yeah, if 
the administration is willing to support the

15:21.939 --> 15:35.331
university and support the press and

15:21.939 --> 15:35.331
help with the cost of that growth, we're going to 
The press is going to need a new warehouse if it

15:35.513 --> 15:40.100
expands its list much more. It's going to need new 
staff and production and every other department.

15:45.488 --> 15:46.470
And more space. And more space for the offices, 
yeah. We have room in the field out back for more

15:50.355 --> 16:00.150
warehouse, but I'm not sure how this building 
could be expanded for offices. We might have to

16:00.210 --> 16:01.993
move part of our operation to another building. 
Other presses do that. It's OK, but it's just not

16:06.295 --> 16:08.578
the same. Of what are you, as you look back, of what 
are you most proud of your 25 years here? Well, I'm

16:16.405 --> 16:32.419
most proud, I think, of keeping a lot of the 
traditions

16:16.405 --> 16:32.419
of the press, the things that we published in the 
past, keeping them alive, keeping our Texas

16:16.405 --> 16:32.419
history publishing live and on track, and getting 
our military history series started and going

16:34.036 --> 17:02.929
strong, and getting the Eastern European series 
started, getting this new Centennial of Flight

16:34.036 --> 17:02.929
series started, and being here and overseeing the 
other new areas that we've gotten into,

16:34.036 --> 17:02.929
presidential studies, although that, you know, 
with Mary Lynn's working directly with the Bush

17:03.567 --> 17:06.031
School people. That was such a natural topic for 
us. It could hardly have been avoided. But those

17:13.000 --> 17:18.869
things are the kinds of things I think I'm proudest 
of having been a part of here.

17:24.557 --> 17:24.957
All right. Just about next to the last question. 
Let's make believe someone walked up to you and

17:27.441 --> 17:31.026
handed you a million-dollar check with one 
stipulation. You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but

17:32.982 --> 17:37.246
you can decide. I couldn't ask them if I could take 
it with me today. No, no. You could decide what A&M

17:40.790 --> 17:43.092
would do with it. If you had a million dollars to 
give Texas A&M, what would you ask them to use it

17:44.734 --> 17:49.299
for? Well, of course I'd give it to the press. To do 
what? To endow publication. In what? In whatever

17:55.125 --> 17:57.127
the press wanted to publish. You mean you wouldn't 
specify? I wouldn't specify. I would rely on the

18:01.938 --> 18:05.962
editors and the director to make that decision. As 
you drive away to a school whose colors are red and

18:07.064 --> 18:18.416
black, how easy will it be for the maroonness in 
your system to fade away? Well, as I said, 25 years

18:20.098 --> 18:25.544
here, we put down some pretty deep roots. All our 
friends are here. We have acquaintances. and a few

18:30.946 --> 18:35.733
friends in Lubbock, but we're going to be leaving a 
lot here. And so the strings are going to be

18:37.255 --> 18:42.002
attached. They're going to be long strings, 
428-mile long strings, but they'll still be

18:42.022 --> 18:46.529
attached. And I'm going to be keeping in touch with 
people here, and they with me, I know. So

18:54.521 --> 18:59.248
I'll have to root for them. Red Raiders at the 
football games, but there'll always be a little

18:59.465 --> 19:05.681
bit of maroon in there. I may have to cover it up with 
red and black, but it'll be there.
