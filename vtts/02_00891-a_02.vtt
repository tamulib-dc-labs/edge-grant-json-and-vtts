WEBVTT

00:01.617 --> 00:07.486
Rick Gerlach, who is the executive assistant to 
Mayor McCann of Houston, Texas. Rick is an alumnus

00:08.748 --> 00:22.709
of the Department of Urban and Regional Planning 
at Texas A&M and is exercising an important role

00:08.748 --> 00:22.709
with regard to the development and growth of 
Houston. And in that regard, I would like to begin

00:22.729 --> 00:29.920
with a rundown of your personal past and how you 
came to be in urban planning.

00:39.274 --> 00:39.714
Okay. I was raised in Abilene, Texas and my father 
was a Texas Aggie and so naturally I went to Texas

00:40.355 --> 00:56.397
A&M

00:40.355 --> 00:56.397
beginning to study law. and decided that wasn't 
exactly what I needed to do. And in taking several

01:03.075 --> 01:15.214
political science courses from Claude Davis, he 
put the bug in my ear about perhaps going into

01:03.075 --> 01:15.214
planning rather than law. There were less 
planners than lawyers then, and that's basically

01:16.756 --> 01:24.949
sort of the way that that happened. Rick, you 
graduated when? I got my master's in 72. OK. And

01:32.623 --> 01:39.154
upon receipt of your master's degree, you came to 
Houston. Well, actually, I came to Houston

01:40.176 --> 01:51.696
my last semester of graduate school, because I was 
on that urban extension fellowship with the city

01:40.176 --> 01:51.696
department. And which got a lot of jobs, by the way. 
I'd strongly suggest that implementing

01:55.226 --> 02:07.064
something like that in the future because it 
places your students without much trouble if they

01:55.226 --> 02:07.064
have any snack. At the end of my tenure at In Model 
Cities, I was asked to stay as environmental

02:07.965 --> 02:20.924
project planner in In Model City department under 
Michael McAnany. OK. Then you were an intern at

02:21.697 --> 02:24.481
that time, more or less. At that time, yes. And then 
when you joined the municipal corporation as a

02:26.164 --> 02:34.216
permanent, was it under civil service? Yes, it 
was. I think I graduated on a Saturday, and I was at

02:37.842 --> 02:42.989
work Monday on the payroll. What was your salary at 
that time? $10,150. And what is it now? About

02:48.983 --> 02:49.864
$41,000. And a car. We can go over that in a hurry. 
Moving right along. Right along. Yes, you know how

03:00.656 --> 03:06.563
to make your old props feel bad,

03:00.656 --> 03:06.563
don't you? Come join us. Okay, so then you joined 
the Municipal Corporation in which position? I

03:16.114 --> 03:18.417
started out as a... a project planner in the Model 
City department. And the interesting thing about

03:22.856 --> 03:36.074
the Model City program, and it sort of switched me 
out of planning in the case of a planning director

03:22.856 --> 03:36.074
type, was that you actually planned the project 
and you had the money to fund it. Directly from the

03:36.535 --> 03:38.617
feds. Right, right from the feds. And you knew if 
your idea was good or bad. You didn't have to wait 40

03:43.003 --> 03:46.648
years to see if this concept was any good. know your 
rehab program busted or you fixed the houses you

03:47.033 --> 04:16.095
know it was very very immediate type of planning 
and uh that was the phone and i told her to grab these

03:47.033 --> 04:16.095
copies quick and uh that sort of took me out of out of 
the traditional city planner type mode of

03:47.033 --> 04:16.095
thinking and into more uh planning and managing it 
too. There was a time that I was project manager for

04:19.203 --> 04:24.071
all those projects too. I was administrator and 
planner. So it was very very rewarding and

04:26.135 --> 04:39.619
revealing and you got to see whether you were right 
or wrong real fast and you had direct interface of

04:26.135 --> 04:39.619
course with the residents that your projects were 
were impacting upon because all of us, the

04:40.274 --> 04:49.048
planners and functional areas, had a task force of 
neighborhood residents that we had to meet with.

04:49.068 --> 04:56.019
And they actually designed with us, we planned 
with them, the types of programs that they wanted.

04:56.981 --> 04:59.585
And so it was very revealing. Did you have much 
interface with the housing authority? At that

05:04.773 --> 05:07.598
time, no. We really didn't. At that time, the 
housing authority hadn't built any new units in 20

05:09.011 --> 05:12.836
years. And they were, no, we really didn't. Then 
from that position, you moved to what? Well, let's

05:23.629 --> 05:24.190
see. I stayed, I moved to a senior project planner 
spot, which didn't do anything except pay me more

05:24.330 --> 05:33.942
and give me an assistant. And then that was 1974. 
And Mayor-elect Hawthorne was trying to put

05:37.210 --> 05:59.614
together an office of the mayor, or a part of the 
office of the mayor that could sort of deal with

05:37.210 --> 05:59.614
overall policy development, which is sort of 
funny because I always thought policies are crude

05:37.210 --> 05:59.614
and never developed. But anyway, we were working 
at that time with several... people, Bob Schultz,

06:07.906 --> 06:18.762
I think it was with one of the big eight accounting 
firms, and Alan Ackman with the assistance group

06:07.906 --> 06:18.762
out of Silver Spring, Maryland, to work on this 
proposal. And all of a sudden, HUD comes up with

06:18.882 --> 06:26.152
capacity building demonstration projects. So my 
boss at that time, which was Mike McEnany, who was

06:26.172 --> 06:37.288
the manager of planning for all the cities, and 
myself and Alan Ackman of the assistance group got

06:26.172 --> 06:37.288
together and we wrote. a proposal, which we got 
funded for a quarter of a million dollars to do

06:37.808 --> 06:50.700
capacity building, which was sort of a, as I 
understood it, and it may be wrong, but a

06:37.808 --> 06:50.700
forerunner of how cities can deal with community 
development programs.

06:53.283 --> 06:59.569
So we set up what was then called the Policy 
Planning Division of the Mayor's Office. Among

06:59.589 --> 07:06.415
the things we were trying to do was to develop an 
urban policy, if you will, which we managed

07:06.648 --> 07:32.284
finally to do last year to do a capital improvement 
program which the city hadn't had ever and

07:06.648 --> 07:32.284
yes it's true now they had a program but it never put 
everything together and it never was approved

07:06.648 --> 07:32.284
officially by motion as policy it was never done 
1974 was the first the first real capital

07:33.293 --> 07:36.117
improvement program per se. The Public Works 
Department has always had a program. And it's a

07:40.783 --> 07:42.766
negotiated program with the council. But as far as 
an official document with project numbers and

07:42.786 --> 07:52.179
everything by function and year and funds and 
everything like that, it was the most complete

07:42.786 --> 07:52.179
one. It was the first one we'd ever done. At any 
rate, we Passed a 1974-75 CIP program, which was

08:02.487 --> 08:08.295
basically the tail end of the bond election. And 
then went right to work on a 1976 through 78 capital

08:10.198 --> 08:27.262
improvement program, which was developed a lot 
like most cities develop their programs and goals

08:10.198 --> 08:27.262
and objectives and the whole nine yards. It was a 
relatively straightforward plan. You said the

08:29.385 --> 08:30.707
whole planning process? Yes. And again, it was 
much more sophisticated. The first one was sort of

08:36.972 --> 08:47.385
a kit of parts approach, but the other one I felt 
very good about because we really did isolate cost

08:36.972 --> 08:47.385
by objectives and types of projects that went 
through such. We've abandoned it now because

08:47.425 --> 08:49.968
nobody paid any attention to it. We had no 
mechanism and still don't of accounting for cost

08:50.949 --> 09:00.220
by project because our accounting system isn't up 
to sorting across funds at this time. We are doing

09:03.211 --> 09:05.334
that now. So we kind of blew that off this last time. 
And that's getting off track, however. Anyway,

09:11.343 --> 09:20.877
and so the policy planning division then changed 
names to planning coordination. When was this?

09:21.558 --> 09:27.286
Well, that was with the, when Hawthorne's didn't 
run and Mary McCann was elected. In 19... In 19, oh

09:28.267 --> 09:30.190
Lord. 78, I guess. 78. Yeah, our division not only 
did the capital improvement program and the

09:33.884 --> 09:43.794
revenue sharing budget, but we also did the 
operating budget for 77 and 78. When the mayor came

09:43.814 --> 09:59.569
in, he removed the budget function out of that 
office and into his office, into the mayor's

09:43.814 --> 09:59.569
office proper in a management services group.

10:03.388 --> 10:05.491
Yes, that was in 78.

10:08.115 --> 10:15.305
And they removed the three people out of our office 
that were doing

10:08.115 --> 10:15.305
it. So that sort of left us with, well, doing about 
half revenue sharing budget, and they're doing

10:15.325 --> 10:20.652
the other half. No operating budget, 
coordination basically A95, which they still do.

10:27.742 --> 10:28.763
Under a new name, called Planning and Management 
Division.

10:33.696 --> 10:58.800
Planning and Management Division basically now, 
and that was where I was up until August of this last

10:33.696 --> 10:58.800
year, was set up trying to do operational 
planning, which is certainly maybe jargon, but

10:33.696 --> 10:58.800
what it is is we're trying to improve the budget 
process to allow for a cost accrual by objective.

10:59.101 --> 11:02.864
if you will, output measures, some way to account 
for it. We've set up the accounting system, at

11:05.206 --> 11:10.551
least we're in the process right now of setting up 
the accounting system to do that. So we'll have a

11:10.611 --> 11:26.485
traditional line item budget over here, a line 
category, and we'll have, however, on the other

11:10.611 --> 11:26.485
side, an operational plan, which basically takes 
your money and tells you what you're getting for

11:10.611 --> 11:26.485
it. And aside here, Rick, is that... As part of our 
core curriculum at Texas A&M, students are

11:28.868 --> 11:50.170
required to take a course in the principles of 
accounting, which coins them with the principles

11:28.868 --> 11:50.170
of how to set up books and keep track of funding, the 
revenues, and the expenditures, and so forth. I'm

11:50.190 --> 11:57.357
not sure that personally I agree that this should 
be part of the required core curriculum for

11:50.190 --> 11:57.357
graduate planning students. But you may be able to 
comment on that from your particular point of

11:57.893 --> 12:04.301
view. No, I think the accounting for the money, as 
far as planning, you can hire somebody to do that.

12:12.171 --> 12:19.740
Some course that would teach you how to budget, how 
to set up a performance budget, not account for it.

12:19.761 --> 12:21.563
Accounting is past tense. That's not what 
planning is about. I would suggest that...

12:25.535 --> 12:31.785
perhaps some of the city management courses might 
be if you're going to require something rather

12:25.535 --> 12:31.785
than accounting. I don't see that at all. Well, 
it's been a problem to me personally, and I just, as

12:33.527 --> 12:39.777
long as we're touching on that, I don't like that. I 
wouldn't have taken that course.

12:45.466 --> 12:46.548
Okay. Okay, then you went from that into the next 
phase of your career. Well, I was... We operated in

12:55.083 --> 12:57.526
planning and management. This is really 
confusing, changing the names. Can't tell the

13:00.790 --> 13:02.131
players without a program. We operated without a 
director. And we criticized the feds. Oh, really?

13:09.420 --> 13:12.023
We operated without a director for almost a year. 
It might have been a year and a half. And basically,

13:14.366 --> 13:16.429
what we had were two managers. And I managed the 
hardware side of the shop, and a woman managed the

13:16.989 --> 13:25.039
software side, the social service side, for 
almost a year. And I was sort of an executive

13:25.643 --> 13:41.982
without portfolio for a long time, basically 
operating under what I got by with was because of my

13:25.643 --> 13:41.982
very strong association with the Department of 
Public Works in capital improvement program and

13:25.643 --> 13:41.982
revenue sharing. And that's where, to this day, a 
lot of my stroke comes from. If I really need help, I

13:47.868 --> 13:53.595
can always feel like I can go to those guys. I've 
helped them out on some things. And they've helped

13:56.069 --> 14:00.295
me out on some things. Basically, they don't have a 
planning group, per se. And I was sort of their

14:05.602 --> 14:06.904
planner. And so if we had to fight a planning 
argument, I'd go up there with the public works

14:07.805 --> 14:16.998
strength behind me and make planning points for 
them. And if I had problems internally, they would

14:17.018 --> 14:21.064
take care of me. That's the system everyone 
criticizes, but it is in fact in place.

14:31.658 --> 14:33.900
Okay, then from that you went on to... Okay, well 
from there, which puts us at August of 1980, there

14:34.301 --> 14:46.174
was a vacancy created on the mayor's office staff. 
as an executive assistant position, which is sort

14:47.504 --> 14:53.330
of like a deputy mayor, but nobody wants to admit 
it. And the mayor saw fit to ask me if I wanted to do

14:55.132 --> 14:59.616
that. And I said yes, yesterday, and made the move. 
Well, when you made that move, you left civil

15:06.023 --> 15:09.666
service behind you. Yes, I did. At that point. Yes, 
I did. So now you're serving at the pleasure of the

15:12.469 --> 15:14.631
mayor. Absolutely. And you like that, too. Yes, I 
do. It makes you responsive. Yes, it does. It makes

15:25.297 --> 15:26.399
you a little more careful. But what happened was 
from a position where I was doing a lot of just staff

15:28.561 --> 15:45.422
research and stuff like that, I've actually 
gotten to a point where I'm liaison with the city

15:28.561 --> 15:45.422
planning department, the real estate 
department, the purchasing department,

15:28.561 --> 15:45.422
management information systems department. my 
old division of the mayor's office, which is

15:45.740 --> 15:50.886
planning and management. Who did I leave out? I 
always leave somebody out anyway. But then

15:53.249 --> 16:10.090
there's some functional areas dealing with 
energy, environment,

15:53.249 --> 16:10.090
legislation in terms of our analysis between 
legal department, the mayor's office, planning

15:53.249 --> 16:10.090
and management. We have a consortium, and I'm the 
mayor's liaison with that. and trying to keep up

16:15.338 --> 16:18.363
with boards and commissions.

16:21.467 --> 16:30.901
Oh, yes, and supposedly liaison with the 
Metropolitan Transit Authority in their

16:21.467 --> 16:30.901
dealings with the office of the mayor. Sounds like 
a bundle to me. Making me old. What do you do in your

16:34.507 --> 16:35.789
spare time? That's another subject. Anyhow... 
Now that you're in this position, Rick, I'd like to

16:40.297 --> 17:08.363
ask you some questions about your perception of 
the planning process as we in planning envision

16:40.297 --> 17:08.363
it, how it has worked since you have come to 
Houston, how it is working currently, and then

16:40.297 --> 17:08.363
later on how you think it may evolve in the 
immediate future. Let's begin with your earliest

17:08.984 --> 17:18.577
firsthand knowledge of how the planning process, 
if there is a planning process at all in Houston,

17:08.984 --> 17:18.577
how it operates. Clearly, we all know that Houston 
doesn't have zoning. But there may be other things

17:24.264 --> 17:26.547
it doesn't have. And there may be things that it 
does have to compensate for non-zoning. And we'd

17:33.756 --> 17:35.318
like to know about it. Because in terms of the 
history of planning in Texas, Houston is an

17:40.135 --> 17:43.018
anomaly in this sense. And it's the largest single 
city in the state. And as such, even if anyone

17:46.080 --> 18:07.560
wanted to, we could not overlook Houston in terms 
of its growth, in terms of how it accommodates

17:46.080 --> 18:07.560
growth, and in terms of how it relates to the formal 
planning process as we might conceive it in a

17:46.080 --> 18:07.560
textbook. Well, in terms of the non-zoning,

18:09.903 --> 18:23.855
I came out of planning school raving about zoning.

18:24.956 --> 18:36.085
I'm not sure that the absence of zoning 
necessarily means there's an absence of planning

18:24.956 --> 18:36.085
or a planning

18:24.956 --> 18:36.085
process. After doing three capital improvement 
programs for the city, I would find that there's a

18:40.463 --> 18:44.789
hell of a lot of planning that's going on. We're 
basing it on something. I've found in most cities

18:48.935 --> 19:00.452
that the form outweighs the substance in most 
planning exercises.

19:00.472 --> 19:08.985
The city of Dallas, for example, it seems to me that 
while they manage their resources much better at

19:10.045 --> 19:33.977
least reading wise they do much better than we do 
they account for things to the nth degree I'm not

19:10.045 --> 19:33.977
real sure that any more thought goes into to their 
physical facilities planning for example which

19:10.045 --> 19:33.977
is what I basically do

19:10.045 --> 19:33.977
the city has grown so quickly and the dynamics of 
having a second downtown in three years where

19:35.105 --> 19:43.173
there used to be a residential subdivision, for 
example. I'm not convinced that zoning would

19:44.654 --> 19:53.503
prohibit anything that's happened in the city of 
Houston. It might have slown it up. It might have

19:56.446 --> 19:58.087
gotten people thrown in jail. But I really don't 
think, I honestly don't think that this is any I'm

20:04.535 --> 20:12.764
not going to say better or worse, but any different 
from any city that would be totally unconstrained

20:04.535 --> 20:12.764
in any kind of growth. It might have directed the 
location of activities to different areas than

20:12.784 --> 20:19.351
has, in fact, occurred. But you're saying that it 
would have happened regardless of zoning. I think

20:24.717 --> 20:26.178
so. If you do have some . The thing about zoning, 
that I miss, or I think that some of our citizens are

20:32.716 --> 20:39.124
missing, is it's not going to prohibit a Greenway 
crossing. It's not going to prohibit a Northwest

20:39.144 --> 20:43.450
crossing. It provides a forum for citizens to 
discuss what the hell's going on in their

20:43.470 --> 20:50.498
neighborhood and if they can do anything about it. 
We do not have that here. I mean, you can do it

20:51.920 --> 20:53.282
politically. If a guy wants to put a service 
station up next to the chairman of Exxon's house,

20:54.904 --> 21:01.272
he's not going to do it. But the little guy, a mom and 
pop junkyard comes up next to him, that's what

21:02.450 --> 21:07.918
we're hurting on, I think. And the fact that, and I 
think everyone will admit that all our codes of

21:08.339 --> 21:17.132
ordinances are geared to new development. And the 
city, being as young as it is, it's just now getting

21:17.152 --> 21:25.304
to the point of redevelopment in these areas. And 
we have no

21:25.364 --> 21:30.752
control. in my way of thinking, that we need to 
ensure that any redevelopment is done in an

21:31.053 --> 21:38.442
orderly manner. And I think that's the problem 
that we've got, not particularly zoning, because

21:38.462 --> 21:53.199
I really don't think, I mean, even most cities have 
a transition zone or an office zone or something

21:38.462 --> 21:53.199
like that, and that's what you have in Montrose and 
the Heights, and that's happening anywhere. But

21:53.240 --> 22:00.368
you do have those nuisances, if you will, that 
zoning might prohibit, but I'm not sure that it's

21:53.240 --> 22:00.368
worth that. And another thing is a citizen just 
won't stand for it. We're not sure in the academic

22:04.934 --> 22:28.547
circles how much of this is due to the public press 
and in terms of the editorial positions that are

22:04.934 --> 22:28.547
taken by the press in the Houston area and how much 
of it seems to be the popular culture of the time and

22:04.934 --> 22:28.547
the trend and the thing to be in favor of or against 
or whatever. I find it not all that easy to accept

22:31.381 --> 22:41.917
that the average citizen in Houston would be 
necessarily opposed to zoning. However, I think

22:41.937 --> 22:58.502
it's not an important point because zoning, we all 
agree as planners, has definite limitations,

22:41.937 --> 22:58.502
particularly planners who have lived and worked 
in Europe, where the concept of zoning originated

22:58.972 --> 23:27.578
and where they've gone beyond it now in terms of 
what it seems to me that, you know, this is not my

22:58.972 --> 23:27.578
interview, it's yours, but I just wanted to throw 
out that I think that zoning in the United States

22:58.972 --> 23:27.578
has really become almost an aberration and has 
expanded into what I would refer to as homogenized

22:58.972 --> 23:27.578
districts of single functions throughout a 
metropolitan area wide urbanized district and

23:27.912 --> 23:57.025
it's not right because it leads to incredible 
inconveniences and they've got over this in

23:27.912 --> 23:57.025
Europe and now they think in terms of 
three-dimensional zoning where you have

23:27.912 --> 23:57.025
multi-purpose buildings and we're getting into 
this now in some of the core areas where you have

23:27.912 --> 23:57.025
uses stratified by whether they're below ground 
at the sidewalk level and then on up into various

23:57.393 --> 24:07.867
elevations above street level, which seems 
incredibly practical and attractive. So the idea

24:08.688 --> 24:19.121
of zoning, I think we can let's go into growth 
management then in terms of the planning process

24:08.688 --> 24:19.121
for Houston. Does Houston attempt to compensate 
for the lack of zoning in any way? And if so, how does

24:26.198 --> 24:28.101
How does this operate, and is it legal? I'm not a 
lawyer. I've told the people on the fourth floor I

24:30.946 --> 24:33.430
won't practice law. But you came from political 
science. Oh, yes. So, opinions, you know,

24:37.678 --> 24:40.001
everybody's got one. The city does have an option, 
which some believe is unconstitutional, about

24:41.564 --> 24:50.940
enforcing private deed restrictions. Uh, and 
that's... Alec Bixley believes it's

24:51.258 --> 24:54.683
unconstitutional. Well, I do too, but I'm not a 
judge, so I don't matter. But anyway... Has there

24:57.847 --> 25:00.811
ever been a court test? No, not up the line. Why not? 
I think they just go in and let them do it. Just let

25:06.399 --> 25:08.482
them break the deed, especially. Or they put so 
much pressure on them, politically and other

25:08.502 --> 25:11.887
ways. You know, I'm not that familiar with that 
situation, but I do know that... The deed

25:18.173 --> 25:23.740
restriction argument is fine as long as your 
subdivision has the goddamn restrictions. Well,

25:24.562 --> 25:30.510
most of our growth took place in the 50s, so we're 
running out of those deed restrictions. They last

25:30.530 --> 25:31.451
for how long? Well, generally, 20 years. It 
depends on the deal. We don't have any say in what

25:35.296 --> 25:38.881
goes into these restrictions, by the way. We can 
enforce them by a little special deal in the

25:39.041 --> 25:43.607
legislature, which, again, has not really been 
tested. I'm not sure anybody would. And it already

25:45.720 --> 25:47.963
applies to Houston, doesn't it? Yes, it does. It's 
a bracket that's one-five bill.

25:54.571 --> 26:03.483
Large cities on a 20-mile-long stream named after 
a four-footed, very almost extinct quadruped.

26:04.664 --> 26:12.835
But now we're finding that as more of these 
restrictions lapse, some of the more affluent

26:04.664 --> 26:12.835
citizens of our city are confronted with the idea 
of stop and go's, you know, modeling studios in

26:13.253 --> 26:22.304
their neighborhoods. And they don't like the work 
of God damn. And it was okay if people in Montrose

26:25.428 --> 26:30.874
had to deal with it, or people in Third Ward. But now 
it's moving down into Tanglewood and people are

26:30.894 --> 26:33.357
getting uppity. You know, and we've got... It's 
coming home to roost. Yeah. We've got people in the

26:37.222 --> 26:42.568
medical center area that want a very restrictive 
parking ordinance. on some kinds of commercial

26:43.055 --> 26:47.000
property, a la San Francisco. Well, you can't say 
some kinds of commercial property are going to

26:47.020 --> 26:56.131
have to provide off-street parking. That's 
zoning. You can't do that. And we've told them it's

26:59.775 --> 27:01.377
illegal. They want to do it anyway. And the thing 
about that is, in their rush to do that, what they do

27:03.840 --> 27:11.830
is eliminate all the shops and stuff in some of 
these neighborhoods that really make the

27:03.840 --> 27:11.830
neighborhood. And what you'll do is a guy will buy 
the house next to him, family evict, build a

27:12.637 --> 27:17.783
parking lot. You've screwed up the economics of 
the whole goddamn neighborhood. But there are

27:22.448 --> 27:33.800
things that are happening in a city that are moving 
toward growth management or zoning type

27:22.448 --> 27:33.800
remedies, such as the sign ordinance that was 
recently passed. And there are some people on

27:34.861 --> 27:41.749
council that want more government intervention 
into the land use decisions. which is ultimately,

27:42.185 --> 27:53.299
I think, as we discussed, probably the solution to 
our transportation woes rather than building

27:42.185 --> 27:53.299
trains and freeways. It's basically some 
language decisions about where people do live and

27:53.319 --> 28:06.116
where they do work, and then you build those 
bridges with the transportation network, not

27:53.319 --> 28:06.116
build a network that serves everybody in the damn 
world. Well, Houston is a city in trouble. I

28:09.480 --> 28:11.483
wouldn't say that. Well, okay. We're a city in 
trouble with a AAA bond writing out. Just let me

28:19.375 --> 28:23.260
remind you of that. Well, not everything can be 
equated to the dollar sign.

28:28.706 --> 28:29.527
Okay. What money isn't, it can buy, but that's 
okay. Everyone has his price. That's right. So

28:35.122 --> 28:36.444
I've been told. Are you suggesting that I've just 
found mine?

28:44.033 --> 28:45.415
No, would I do that? You would. How dare you? 
Anyway, aside from the frivolity, Houston grew up

28:48.098 --> 28:57.790
at the wrong time, as it were. All the eastern 
seaboard cities had their mass transit

29:05.193 --> 29:34.930
facilities in place because they grew up before 
the advent of the automobile, and even the cities

29:05.193 --> 29:34.930
on the West Coast did the same, such as Los Angeles, 
of all creatures, with the red car system that

29:05.193 --> 29:34.930
operated beautifully up to and through the Second 
World War, at which time it was bought out by the

29:05.193 --> 29:34.930
automobile manufacturers in Detroit for clear 
reasons, and the rights-of-way no longer

29:05.193 --> 29:34.930
operative. But anyway, what I'm saying is, now you 
mentioned energy as being one of your concerns.

29:42.862 --> 29:45.365
And you mentioned the growth of Houston. And you 
mentioned all the industries coming in. And the

29:48.488 --> 29:59.939
mayor is very proud of the fact that Houston's 
economy is probably one of the brightest, if not

29:48.488 --> 29:59.939
the brightest spots for capital in the entire 
United States. How do you relate all these

30:01.601 --> 30:04.123
together, Rick? in terms of continuing to provide 
basic accessibility to various sites for various

30:04.711 --> 30:34.600
activities throughout the greater Houston area, 
given an energy crunch in the future, given a

30:04.711 --> 30:34.600
growing industrial base for Houston, given, 
therefore, the multiplier effect on the entire

30:35.187 --> 30:47.902
retailing economy and business economy, 
wholesaling, distribution activities, and all

30:35.187 --> 30:47.902
the rest, and what the consequences are for 
residential activity and continued growth. In

30:48.482 --> 31:02.899
terms of growth management, otherwise called 
planners by those of us who still identify

30:48.482 --> 31:02.899
ourselves as planners, how would you like to 
respond to, I guess this is a question, I was hoping

31:03.217 --> 31:06.542
it was going to be rhetorical. No, not at all. Oh, 
Lord. Would you like to handle that? Yeah, I'll

31:16.077 --> 31:16.939
give it a shot. I think that we're finding in 
Houston just recently a bit of an implosion, if you

31:16.999 --> 31:29.038
will, or at least some...
