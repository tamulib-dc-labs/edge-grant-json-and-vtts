One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, 
testing. One, two, three, four, one, two, three,

00:07.530 --> 00:10.775
four, testing. This is bringing philosophers to 
life in the background somewhere. Get that on him.

00:16.243 --> 00:31.827
This is Monday, April the 2nd, and we're in the 
Heritage Preservation Outer Office in the

00:16.243 --> 00:31.827
library, and I have the honor and pleasure of 
interviewing Dr. Jack Campbell about his work

00:32.684 --> 00:35.749
three decades of service here at Texas A&M. To 
begin with, Jack, to introduce yourself to anyone

00:36.550 --> 00:52.735
who listens or who reads, give a biographical 
summary of yourself growing up, where, when, what

00:36.550 --> 00:52.735
did mom and dad do, high school, college, 
experience before you came to A&M. Well, the year

00:53.322 --> 01:01.211
of my birth was 1927 when Lindbergh flew across the 
Atlantic. I was born in Chicago, Illinois. My

01:03.975 --> 01:11.744
father was working for Armour and Company as one of 
the earliest personnel or industrial engineers.

01:13.065 --> 01:16.950
He was originally from Duluth, Minnesota. My 
mother was from Indiana, and my parents met at the

01:17.082 --> 01:26.404
University of Indiana in the 1920s. We lived in an 
apartment in Chicago. until I was about seven.

01:34.471 --> 01:40.659
Went to school in the city when the Depression was 
starting, and it was pretty rough. And my

01:41.841 --> 01:49.210
experience in school was great if I didn't get 
knocked down at least one or two times. About

01:50.312 --> 02:00.285
the time I was seven, we moved out to Downers Grove, 
which was 20 miles west of Chicago. and my father

02:01.075 --> 02:08.011
would take the train into work and I had the 
advantages of going to suburban schools. I

02:09.594 --> 02:12.621
graduated from high school in 1945. Which high 
school? Downers Grove High School. They just had

02:17.138 --> 02:18.419
one high school. I was president of the senior 
class,

02:19.059 --> 02:27.068
somewhat active in school. But it was the last year 
the Cubs won the pennant, I remember, in 1945. It

02:32.333 --> 02:33.815
sticks in my mind. From there, I was 4F for the Army. 
The war was about over and I failed. I had heart

02:45.227 --> 02:47.630
murmur and bad ears. And so I went to college at 
Cornell in Mount Vernon, Iowa and majored in

02:47.690 --> 02:56.280
history.

02:59.384 --> 03:06.452
When I graduated in 1949, I wasn't sure what I was 
going to do, but I always wanted to be a writer. And I

03:07.445 --> 03:13.393
thought the great American novel would be in the 
Chicago Stockyards, the slaughterhouse of the

03:07.445 --> 03:13.393
world. So I got a job as an industrial engineer at 
Armors, but didn't care for it too much and decided

03:13.413 --> 03:25.791
I'd go into teaching after a year of industrial 
engineering. And I applied to the University of

03:26.598 --> 03:32.290
Illinois to get teacher certification. And I got a 
job in the summer of 1950 as a camp counselor in New

03:32.891 --> 03:38.683
Hampshire. 25th of June of that year, the Korean 
War started. I was one of the first to be called in,

03:45.363 --> 03:50.851
and this time I passed the physical. But I was 
already at the University of Illinois and was

03:51.712 --> 03:59.743
deferred until the end of the school year. at which 
time I entered the Navy on July the 9th, 1951, for a

03:59.723 --> 04:20.413
four-year enlistment, serving at the Atlantic 
Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, aboard a heavy

03:59.723 --> 04:20.413
cruiser, the Macon, and then the last year with a 
squadron at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On discharge,

04:22.857 --> 04:26.963
I...

04:28.580 --> 04:39.079
I went back to the University of Illinois for a year 
to finish a master's and a teaching certificate,

04:28.580 --> 04:39.079
and got married.

04:39.987 --> 04:40.728
How much of this? Is this all right? I don't want to 
use too much tape, because I've got a lot of

04:41.990 --> 04:46.037
marriages. Anyway, my wife was a singer, and she'd 
been on Broadway in The King and I as the chorus, and

04:46.558 --> 05:00.882
she wanted to come back to New York, so I got a job 
after I was certified at Manhasset on Long Island

05:01.267 --> 05:12.902
while she tried to get a job on Broadway again. 
After about two years of teaching there, I was

05:14.023 --> 05:24.556
discouraged and wanted to work on a doctorate. I 
had been taking a few courses at Columbia. About

05:29.431 --> 05:43.946
the time my marriage was breaking up, I decided to 
go full time at Columbia Teachers College, where I

05:29.431 --> 05:43.946
worked with my master's leader was Dr. Lawrence 
Kremen.

05:47.450 --> 05:53.616
After about two years, I got a teaching job at 
Cranford, New Jersey. became the chairman of the

05:54.862 --> 06:12.149
history department at the high school, taught 
there about five years, completed the doctorate

05:54.862 --> 06:12.149
with a dissertation on Colonel Francis W. Parker, 
a father of progressive education. The next thing

06:14.413 --> 06:21.544
I did was to get a job as teaching at Brooklyn 
College. where I taught some foundation history

06:22.672 --> 06:36.647
and philosophy courses, but mostly supervised 
social studies teachers in the various schools of

06:22.672 --> 06:36.647
Brooklyn. It was a very fine experience, 
teaching-wise. But the commute from New Jersey

06:41.984 --> 06:44.989
was two hours each way. And I started looking for 
another position and was chosen as the head of the

06:46.230 --> 07:00.711
Department of Education at Lycoming College in 
Williamsport, Pennsylvania. And there, in a

07:01.957 --> 07:18.526
small liberal arts college, I developed the 
programs and taught supervised student

07:01.957 --> 07:18.526
teachers, but was not able to fully develop my 
interest in the history and philosophy of

07:01.957 --> 07:18.526
education. In 1970, I met Glenn Johnson. who was 
head of the education department at Texas A&M when

07:24.046 --> 07:31.777
I was at a meeting in Chicago. And we liked each 
other, and he invited me to come down to look at

07:33.239 --> 07:38.686
Texas A&M. Before I got there, I believe President 
Rutter, who I had heard so much about, had died. I

07:48.042 --> 07:57.851
was offered a position and came to Texas A&M in the 
fall of 1970.

08:00.414 --> 08:04.918
As far as you know, was there a search committee? 
Oh, yes. They were developing the College of

08:09.022 --> 08:14.086
Education, which had been established one year 
earlier. It had been a department. and they were

08:16.139 --> 08:18.563
looking for foundation people. Glenn Johnson was 
also a graduate of Teachers College Columbia. The

08:24.491 --> 08:32.263
man I was named after was Carnegie. They called him 
Andy. And he had taught economics at Texas A&M.

08:39.065 --> 08:44.038
Before that had been a vice president for some 
insurance company. And he had recommended Texas

08:44.961 --> 08:50.736
A&M to me, Andy Carnegie. When you and Glenn

08:50.716 --> 09:04.088
met at a professional meeting, as far as you knew, 
what was this position? What was it described as

09:04.128 --> 09:05.269
being? The position was described as in 
foundations of education, which was exactly what

09:05.289 --> 09:15.678
I had been prepared to do, but had been doing 
everything at Lycoming College. So it was ideal

09:16.239 --> 09:20.723
for me, and I thought it would be a wonderful place 
for the children. Now, as far as you knew, what did

09:20.703 --> 09:24.809
you know about Texas A&M at that point? Only that it 
was a wonderful place from Andy Carnegie, who was

09:24.829 --> 09:39.591
not exactly my godfather, but he had been my 
father's boss at Armoring Company, and my father

09:24.829 --> 09:39.591
thought he'd make points by naming me after him, 
but he left Armors. Spell his last name.

09:41.434 --> 09:45.360
K-E-N-A-G-Y.

09:45.340 --> 09:58.383
He was quite active in the community as well as in 
economics and was one of the founders of the, I

09:45.340 --> 09:58.383
think it's the retirement nursing home, 
Briarcrest. And he was on the Governor's

09:58.403 --> 10:01.088
Commission for Aging. So what you knew about A&M at 
that time was positive. Positive. As far as you

10:07.395 --> 10:11.539
knew, what was A&M like before you came to? Well, I 
was very ignorant of Texas and wasn't just sure of

10:11.699 --> 10:18.987
the geography. I didn't know up from down or Dallas 
from Houston. I had to look at a map. had never

10:25.013 --> 10:28.578
really considered Texas. But I had the wonderful 
glowing accounts from Andy Carnegie.

10:37.690 --> 10:42.517
So I came here, and from the very first moment I fell 
in love with it. The trees were in bloom. It was

10:44.760 --> 10:46.482
spring, I guess. The students were so friendly. Up 
north at Lycoming, the teacher was the enemy of the

10:50.948 --> 10:57.516
people. Down here, the students seemed to be so 
friendly and so nice. I remember I stepped on the

11:03.804 --> 11:11.714
grass looking at a tree, and a student very 
politely told me it was sacred ground. It

11:12.094 --> 11:15.338
impressed me very much. Just fell in love with the 
university from the very first moment. As far as

11:20.432 --> 11:24.779
you know, were you the only person interviewed for 
this job? At the time I came down for the interview,

11:26.161 --> 11:30.428
I was the only one. There were others. I remember 
Jim Rollins was one of them. hired at the same time,

11:35.517 --> 11:48.154
but I was the only one, and I went through the 
various stages of ultimately getting to meet Dean

11:35.517 --> 11:48.154
Hubert, who was, of course, very impressive. 
Describe your first impression of Frank Hubert.

11:51.518 --> 12:00.951
Well, he impressed me as being extremely 
insightful

11:51.518 --> 12:00.951
and As I got to know him better later, I realized he 
was not only insightful, but he was very powerful.

12:09.008 --> 12:11.832
He was kind of like a Toscanini. He made you play 
better than you knew how to. I had great respect for

12:15.818 --> 12:21.606
him. There was also another man, and I can't 
remember his name, who I was working with. Dean

12:27.053 --> 12:33.784
Hubert, and developing an off-campus program 
that was quite extensive. Did Hubert ask you some

12:33.824 --> 12:38.031
key questions?

12:41.797 --> 12:45.743
Well, I'm sure he did, but I've lost the key to that. 
It wasn't just you got acquainted session? Oh, no,

12:47.967 --> 12:48.588
no. He asked me questions about my education, 
about my position. I don't believe he asked me

12:56.862 --> 13:05.158
anything about my slant, my philosophy of 
education, although we talked, I'm sure, about

12:56.862 --> 13:05.158
philosophy.

13:08.585 --> 13:11.832
Who were the other key people you met with on that 
list? Well, the one person I can't think of is I left

13:16.278 --> 13:19.322
shortly after I got here. But, of course, Glenn 
Johnson was one of the—well, sponsored me,

13:19.983 --> 13:25.830
actually. I remember talking with Bob Schuetz, 
who became a very good friend of mine later. At that

13:34.521 --> 13:44.513
time, he was in the curriculum

13:34.521 --> 13:44.513
development at our department.

13:46.147 --> 13:48.731
I'm sorry, I can't think of the name of this. As you 
understood it, you were going to be responsible

13:49.372 --> 13:54.560
for what courses and what specialties? I was going 
to work with the introductory courses, which were

13:54.580 --> 14:00.730
called foundations. There was the history of 
American education, and then there was the

14:00.770 --> 14:06.619
history of a world education. There were the two 
basic courses that they had. These were

14:14.047 --> 14:15.170
undergraduate. We did not have the graduate 
program, but I was told that they would have you

14:15.190 --> 14:23.494
work on a graduate program as I moved along. I was 
also interested in the comparative education.

14:27.601 --> 14:35.816
There was a Pan-American dimension that was going 
on at this time, connecting the university with

14:27.601 --> 14:35.816
Mexico. Comparative education was also one of my 
fields at Columbia. And so they made the offer, and

14:42.712 --> 14:46.997
this is the only dollar question we're going to 
ask. What was your beginning salary? I can

14:48.499 --> 14:49.981
remember it very well. It was $17,000, and I think 
at the time I was making around $10,000 as chairman

14:50.041 --> 15:00.154
of the Department of Education at Lycoming, maybe 
$11,000. So this was, I couldn't believe the

15:00.414 --> 15:05.040
salary. And I'm assuming that the living costs 
here were not higher. No, no, it was much, much

15:14.539 --> 15:16.862
better. And housing was much better. As a matter of 
fact, the day I was interviewed, I was also shown

15:19.986 --> 15:28.617
around by a real estate agent to get an idea of the 
housing. And there weren't any apartments at the

15:30.800 --> 15:40.512
time, very few, it seemed as though, but houses 
were readily available. And so you moved down here

15:40.660 --> 15:44.827
then in the fall or summer? In summer. Moved in the 
summer and got, I think it was in July, and then I

15:45.288 --> 15:57.908
spent the rest of the summer in the library 
developing bibliographies and getting

15:45.288 --> 15:57.908
acquainted on campus. My first class was in the 
fall. And as you began to get acquainted on campus,

16:05.433 --> 16:08.618
What was your feeling about the way newcomers were 
received? It was just marvelous. In fact, there

16:10.221 --> 16:28.673
was several days of going around being told about 
the insurance plan being introduced to many

16:10.221 --> 16:28.673
aspects of the community, and even a dinner over in 
the core building which introduced me to the

16:29.598 --> 16:35.644
Corps, and it was very impressive. And I remember, 
I think I spilled a little bit of coffee or

16:36.625 --> 16:46.055
something on one of the cadets, and I wanted to pay 
for the cleaning, and he refused to do that. But the

16:46.916 --> 16:49.559
cadets were just so nice. But that was one of the 
features of dinner with the Corps of Cadets. All

16:55.425 --> 16:58.508
right, Dr. Williams wasn't yet here, General

16:59.129 --> 17:06.658
Ludeke was the interim. Did he, by chance, welcome 
people? Yes, we had a, I don't remember now if it was

17:08.801 --> 17:24.040
just the new people or all of the faculty, but I 
remember meeting him and shaking his hand at a

17:08.801 --> 17:24.040
reception. And this was the department of what? I 
was in the Department of Educational Curriculum

17:28.907 --> 17:32.031
and Instruction. Describe that department and 
who the key people were then. Our offices were in

17:37.138 --> 17:39.942
the old academic building. My office was on the 
fourth floor, and I had the big room. I had big

17:45.630 --> 17:48.033
classes, you know, 80 or 90. Glenn Johnson was the 
department head. And Bob Schuetz was in English,

17:54.327 --> 18:00.335
Jim Rollins was new and he was in math ed. Joe Illica 
was in reading.

18:08.605 --> 18:11.349
Del Yank was in science education. But

18:11.369 --> 18:19.959
we were like a little happy family and we were all 
excited about developing our program. How many

18:19.979 --> 18:22.022
were in the department total? Well, there were a 
few who were part-time, who supervised students.

18:29.562 --> 18:32.165
I don't think, I know there weren't more than 10. 
About

18:32.185 --> 18:38.371
how many majors were there then, do you remember? 
Well, there were, we were, my memory doesn't, I

18:39.832 --> 18:46.679
remember there were only 14,000 students on 
campus. And women were new, and most of them, I

18:48.641 --> 18:54.186
think, were in our department. But I can't 
remember how many majors we had, but it was

18:55.094 --> 19:04.669
becoming a big department in terms of majors. And 
the dean office down on the second floor, I

19:05.410 --> 19:08.816
believe, didn't he? I think the dean was in the 
library, maybe. Was that possible? When we were in

19:15.326 --> 19:20.815
the academic building, he must have been. there in 
that building, but I can't picture that now. I

19:23.957 --> 19:28.126
remember the big Liberty Bell was down on the 
ground floor at the time.

19:31.213 --> 19:37.707
What were your first impressions of A&M students 
in terms of their capability and their interests

19:31.213 --> 19:37.707
and so forth? Well, of course, I was very impressed 
with how good they were and receptive to learning.

19:45.665 --> 19:56.983
I think in the beginning, my students were not that 
good in spelling and grammar, as I might have

19:45.665 --> 19:56.983
expected, but that soon changed. But they were 
very eager, very conscientious, and very

20:02.071 --> 20:03.213
respectful. I remember being called sir, which I 
wasn't sure if that was a compliment or not at

20:03.954 --> 20:11.287
first. As a matter of fact, a little incidentally, 
I had a lot of corps students and I wondered just why

20:12.509 --> 20:23.027
so many in the corps wanted to go into education. I 
was teaching the introductory course And I found

20:26.354 --> 20:30.904
out that most of them just wanted to see what girls 
were like. So that's why they were coming into

20:33.630 --> 20:35.895
these courses. And the first year or two, about 
what was the male-female ratio in your classes? I

20:42.183 --> 20:48.933
had more women, I think, than men, even in the 
beginning. I had rather large classes, not

20:49.013 --> 20:56.584
exceptionally large, but I would have fifty or 
more in some of those introductory courses. My

20:58.867 --> 21:08.882
impression was, other than core—I also had 
Reveille in one of my first classes, and I thought

20:58.867 --> 21:08.882
the dog was so smart, he knew when the bell was 
supposed to ring. and he would start growling, and

21:08.862 --> 21:18.895
I didn't know until later that he was taught to do 
that, make sure we didn't go overtime. But the

21:20.537 --> 21:22.640
students are just marvelous. Did they tell you in 
advance who Reveley was and that was okay? Yes, oh

21:26.505 --> 21:28.247
yes, they explained to me this. He was the keeper of 
the flame, so to speak, and the dog just sat there

21:28.388 --> 21:36.338
very quietly, but about the time And at first I 
thought, well, people are shuffling their feet.

21:40.122 --> 21:41.765
He didn't like the shuffling. He thought there was 
a little anxiety there and the class needed to

21:41.846 --> 21:47.296
bark. But that alerted us to the time. We didn't 
have bells. Actually, I guess this is on your

21:54.830 --> 22:03.864
report somewhere we had a bell that blew at 8 in the 
morning, and one at 12, and one at 5, and sort of like

21:54.830 --> 22:03.864
a mill town. But we did not have bells in academic 
building, to my knowledge. So we were on our own as

22:09.993 --> 22:12.898
far as getting students out on time. Reveille 
helped us. This is an editorial note. Dr. Jack

22:17.064 --> 22:23.554
Kenny Williams came as president November the 
1st, 1970. One of the agreements he was able to

22:24.935 --> 22:40.007
obtain from the board of directors, they were then 
called, the title was not yet regents, was that

22:24.935 --> 22:40.007
they would allow him to select one of the existing 
dormitories on campus and designate that

22:41.692 --> 22:59.498
dormitory for the first semester in spring of 1971 
to be a woman's dorm and open to all undergraduate

22:41.692 --> 22:59.498
women. That decision led to a sharp increase in the 
enrollment of women here, and in correlation with

23:00.507 --> 23:15.563
that, the number of men went up also. And

23:15.543 --> 23:33.810
the mention of Reveille should be known by 
everyone that Reveille was the only non-human

23:15.543 --> 23:33.810
animal allowed into every class, every room, 
everywhere. So that here was the combination. Did

23:41.701 --> 23:43.744
the anyone give you any orientation into Aggie

23:44.045 --> 23:54.302
vocabulary, traditions, habits? How did you 
learn about this institution's traditions?

23:59.650 --> 24:04.939
Well, of course I was interested in the history 
because it was my field and I I think I pursued as

24:05.307 --> 24:08.811
much as I could the background. I don't recall any 
formal introduction. Jim Rollins, who came at the

24:15.860 --> 24:23.971
same time as I did in math ed, had been a student 
here, graduating in 1952. He helped me a great deal

24:24.311 --> 24:29.758
with the traditions. I was very much interested in 
them.

24:35.024 --> 24:39.649
had hoped that I might write a biography of Earl 
Rudder. I knew the history of A&M was being written

24:41.071 --> 24:45.757
at that time. I made some overtures, but someone 
else was going to be doing it. So I missed out on

24:51.504 --> 24:54.047
that, but no one ever did it. I think his biography 
is not developed. No, not done yet. To whom did you

24:59.053 --> 25:02.837
turn for advice in those early semesters? I think 
Glenn Johnson was just a marvelous leader and

25:04.150 --> 25:11.291
congenial person. He'd had me over to his house for 
dinner, my wife and I.

25:20.924 --> 25:23.968
He was, I would say, my main mentor. Bob Schutz and I 
became very close. His birthday was one day after

25:26.270 --> 25:29.454
mine. I'm a day older than he is. We became quite 
close. As I say, we were such a small group, we often

25:34.780 --> 25:42.209
went to lunch together and worked on ideas over the 
lunch every day. Where did you and friends like

25:43.451 --> 25:48.957
that, where did you all have coffee and then where 
did you have lunch? It was in the MSC. I've

25:51.763 --> 25:53.986
forgotten just where it was now. It was not the big, 
it was just a little side area. And then they

25:58.072 --> 26:01.837
developed a line later. I think we called it the 
snack bar. Snack bar. And then the food developed

26:05.303 --> 26:13.915
more sophistication as we went along. But we'd get 
a table and chat and talk. Sometimes we brought a

26:17.901 --> 26:19.804
bag lunch. And where did you park? I had various 
parking places and for the first five years I think

26:32.592 --> 26:37.581
1970 to around 1975 or 76, I rode my bicycle. It was 
only about two and a half miles, and in the morning

26:38.843 --> 26:46.035
it was cool enough, so I didn't work up a lot of 
sweat.

26:50.222 --> 26:54.229
There was no locking of bicycles, just left them 
there. And there weren't many bikes then, were

26:54.412 --> 26:56.238
there? No. Later I had various parking lots. One of 
the last ones I remember was where that building is

27:00.232 --> 27:06.312
now. that has all the air conditioning and 
equipment. I forgot just what the name of that

27:12.263 --> 27:17.569
building is, but that was one of the best parking 
lots. But for the first five years I think I rode my

27:18.050 --> 27:21.914
bicycle. What were your assumed guidelines, your 
personal guidelines for the hours you were on

27:29.596 --> 27:34.321
campus and your dress and so forth. The policy was 
to be in your office at all times, which I rather

27:34.922 --> 27:47.876
liked because it gave me a chance to get prepared 
and do my research. If I went home, I'd play with the

27:48.316 --> 27:58.067
children all the time, so when I would go home in the 
I don't believe the first few years I had night

27:58.047 --> 28:00.692
classes. Later on, most of my classes were at 
night. But I liked that full time. And so students

28:07.146 --> 28:11.415
were free to come in at any time. I was in the office 
all the time. And so you got here about eight and

28:14.348 --> 28:17.891
stayed until about? Oh, at least five. Yes, I could 
remember a time or two on my bicycle hearing the

28:21.354 --> 28:32.064
bell, you know, the whistle that blew all over town 
and realized I was going to be late to my office. I

28:32.124 --> 28:37.649
was not late to class, but I, you could, you always 
knew what time it was. This is another editorial

28:38.589 --> 28:43.714
note and typist tacked this back up on to the first 
editorial note about Dr. Williams. And I think

28:49.435 --> 29:07.491
maybe his second year here, some small group of 
faculty went to him to complain about the whistle

28:49.435 --> 29:07.491
that blew at 8 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock, and 5 
o'clock that it made them feel like they were

28:49.435 --> 29:07.491
factory workers. And so he immediately had it 
terminated. Many others were disappointed that

29:12.938 --> 29:25.935
that was terminated because that, for years and 
years, had been a signal for the College Station

29:12.938 --> 29:25.935
neighborhood near the campus Parents told their 
children, when you hear the 5 o'clock whistle,

29:26.523 --> 29:31.776
that's time for you to come back home. And the 12 
o'clock, 1 o'clock was used by the A&M

29:31.816 --> 29:43.165
consolidated school system always, so there were 
two sides to the argument. Yeah. But President

29:45.173 --> 29:48.679
Williams blew the whistle on it, is that right? 
Yeah, that's right, yeah. He blew the whistle on

29:49.520 --> 29:51.584
the whistle. What was the, in terms of the general 
appearance of the faculty in those days? What did

29:57.934 --> 30:03.162
a... Oh, we all was required to wear a coat and tie. 
And of course that was my working uniform anyway.

30:06.927 --> 30:16.439
And I don't, if I can add to it, I think it was in the 
energy crisis that we had the right to bear arms, so

30:06.927 --> 30:16.439
to speak. But yes, we were very formal, but coat and 
tie was the regular uniform of the day. And what

30:25.090 --> 30:27.613
about beards and long hair? I don't think, I never 
tried to pass that one, but I don't believe I saw

30:28.218 --> 30:34.986
anyone. Did anyone say anything about the coat and 
tie? No, I don't believe they ever did. It was just

30:41.114 --> 30:44.058
what you did. I mean, I had done that as a professor 
at Brooklyn College and Lycoming College also. It

30:51.487 --> 30:52.328
was expected. And was it common for you and your 
colleagues to check the roll? in those days to keep

30:58.340 --> 31:00.544
attendance? Oh, yes. Attendance was very vital. I 
kept attendance throughout my career at A&M. Same

31:07.255 --> 31:08.558
here, same here. We were still in that era posting 
grades on our door. in the history department. Did

31:16.390 --> 31:17.111
you all do that? Well, I remember it later, but I 
don't remember the first few years. I remember

31:20.838 --> 31:29.595
that later we posted grades, then they put Social 
Security numbers down, and I think finally that

31:30.267 --> 31:34.474
disappeared, but I don't think they did it the 
first few years in education. Do you remember any

31:34.955 --> 31:47.476
anecdotes or stories about Aggie Texans giving 
you new excuses for missing the class or anything

31:34.955 --> 31:47.476
like that? Do you remember some anecdotes about 
that? Well, you know, there's wonderful

31:50.622 --> 31:53.587
anecdotes. I may get them mixed up with

31:58.887 --> 32:08.888
Well,

31:58.887 --> 32:08.888
there

31:58.887 --> 32:08.888
was always this death in the family. I

32:08.928 --> 32:19.410
think one of them was that he couldn't get to class 
because a couple of his cows got out of the yard.
