WEBVTT

00:03.794 --> 00:07.481
18th of December. No, I'll take it back. 20th of 
December. 20th

00:11.929 --> 00:19.183
of December.

00:19.544 --> 00:20.145
Tell me about that. This was shortly after we 
deployed to Kunming. Prior to that, the Japanese

00:29.174 --> 00:33.798
had taken over so-called French Indochina at that 
time. They were operating a training base out of

00:33.818 --> 00:38.643
Hanoi to train their bomber pilots. And they had 
used the route from Hanoi to Kualian and to Kunming

00:39.383 --> 00:59.181
to bomb those cities, Kunming being a key city in 
the southern part of China, and also a big air base,

00:39.383 --> 00:59.181
and Kualian being another main supply base of the 
southern part of China, the south central part.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.830
And they had no opposition whatsoever. They sent 
me green crews up there, just bombing the city and

01:02.190 --> 01:07.937
the air base, trying to hit the air base. So when we 
got up there, that's one of the things we began to

01:07.957 --> 01:12.923
wait for. Well, as I say, we went up on the 14th and on 
the 20th. Now, I'd been on, as soon as we got up

01:16.027 --> 01:25.619
there, we went off on some scramble missions, 
expecting them the very next day, 15th, 16th,

01:16.027 --> 01:25.619
17th, and this was full of that for a while. So you 
were waiting for the bombers to hit you from Hanoi,

01:29.283 --> 01:34.290
but they didn't. We know for a fact that several 
raids took off and shortly after they got over the

01:34.310 --> 01:43.424
Chinese border, about halfway up the turnaround 
went back. Why is that? We know they had their own

01:44.505 --> 01:53.799
intelligence contacts in Kunming and they knew we 
were up there and they knew we had scrambled to get

01:44.505 --> 01:53.799
in the air. As a matter of fact, we had a Chinese spy 
on the hillside right opposite the air base at

01:58.662 --> 02:01.425
Hanoi. We knew exactly when they took off. And we 
also had in China, and that's one thing that

02:04.448 --> 02:24.109
General Chennault helped the Chinese develop in 
the late 30s, was a ground observer core system

02:04.448 --> 02:24.109
where the Chinese—we attempted to do that here in 
the earlier days in NORAD and ADC in the United

02:04.448 --> 02:24.109
States, which was useless. But over there, that's 
all they had, and the ground observer core worked

02:24.129 --> 02:27.673
with their meet telephone and signal systems, get 
word about an air raid coming up to Kunming, and

02:27.873 --> 02:34.485
that's how we were alerted. That's what we 
scrambled on. Eventually, they got a few radars

02:36.489 --> 02:51.737
over there through the land-leash system, but we 
got word on the morning of the 20th that the raid had

02:36.489 --> 02:51.737
taken off, and it was, I think it was 14 bombers.

02:57.792 --> 02:58.894
Ten bombers. Ten bombers. Ten Japanese bombers 
were en route. So you scrambled. We had about

03:04.682 --> 03:08.247
20,000 feet just approaching Kunming. So you 
scrambled. We knew they were on their way up, and I

03:10.831 --> 03:19.564
think we were at 20,000 feet in an area southeast of 
Kunming.

03:24.387 --> 03:30.112
I think we had 14 airplanes. We had to divide what we 
shot down by 14 people to get credit for our $500. We

03:36.979 --> 03:37.620
know this. Not one single one of those 10 airplanes 
ever got back across the Chinese border. No

03:42.124 --> 03:43.545
kidding. You nailed all of them. But we didn't 
account for them. In other words, the pilot didn't

03:47.149 --> 03:50.732
come back and say, I shot this one down, I shot that 
one. I came back and claimed two probables. It was

03:54.196 --> 03:55.298
my first combat. I had gotten so close to one, you 
know, my ego was like a toilet bowl. We just

03:59.083 --> 03:59.944
couldn't wait. And once the fighting started... 
Well, tell me when it started. Tell me about that.

04:06.794 --> 04:07.936
We climbed up. We knew they were coming. And the 
usual taxes, we'd climb up to altitude about

04:09.999 --> 04:14.145
20,000 feet. Now, you're getting higher than 
20,000 feet in a P-40, and, you know, you just have

04:14.165 --> 04:18.351
to operate at max volume. You don't have any 
reserves. And generally, the Japanese never flew

04:19.872 --> 04:23.276
above about 18,000 feet. So that gave us about 
2,000 foot altitude, which is all we needed. Well,

04:28.261 --> 04:31.905
coming down on top of them, you know, you'd pick up 
speed. And we'd have a band of speed, and I'd hit and

04:32.766 --> 04:40.735
run and come back, hit and run, peel off, come back, 
hit and run. And we finally saw this formation. All

04:44.039 --> 04:49.845
of them were in one formation of ten of them, a V. And 
of course, they had the right to come in. We

04:50.838 --> 04:52.239
immediately started attacking them. Once we 
started the attack, we were in elements of four,

04:52.380 --> 04:59.687
about, I think it was fourteen airplanes. And 
three or four in each? Four in each section, so it

05:01.069 --> 05:03.872
had to be two of us separate. And which ones in the V 
did you strike out first? Well, whenever, the

05:08.116 --> 05:12.781
minute we saw them, we started after them. Well, of 
course, all fourteen airplanes didn't arrive at

05:12.801 --> 05:15.684
the same time. See, in the formation we'd have, 
we'd have what's called The attack section would

05:19.593 --> 05:21.616
be four. There would be a support section about 
maybe 1,000 feet higher than them, a little behind

05:22.097 --> 05:27.484
them. Yeah. And then the reserve, another four at 
the top altitude, maybe 1,000 feet above, still

05:28.105 --> 05:34.074
further behind them. Sure. And, of course, 
everybody's looking, and we're flying back into

05:34.734 --> 05:41.184
loose formation to stand together to keep the 
airplanes within sight of each other. Once you saw

05:41.304 --> 05:45.129
the formation, you know, you pass a word, and 
everybody sees the formation. Sure. Well, then,

05:45.490 --> 05:49.195
of course, everybody pushes forward and gets 
there and maybe checks their guns even. And then we

05:49.478 --> 05:58.791
start, well of course, the closest flights of one, 
that's another thing that was peculiar to some.

05:59.612 --> 06:06.422
The first guy that got there was the first guy, I 
mean the one nearest was always the first one that

05:59.612 --> 06:06.422
got there. And from then on, boy, it was a fight 
about getting in your position. I've had to be

06:09.907 --> 06:16.817
amongst the pilots to get the attack, to make the 
first attack on the bomber. It was that eager. The

06:19.567 --> 06:23.332
first airplane, of course, in the lead, the boys 
would see him at the same time. He's the first one to

06:23.352 --> 06:25.055
go make the attack. Well, the rest of them then come 
by, and then, you know, you're peeling around to

06:25.075 --> 06:28.439
come back. And from then on, boy, it's a fight as to 
who's going to do it, like a bunch of chickens

06:28.520 --> 06:37.292
getting up there, birds, I mean, as to who's going 
to get in there and make that attack. And several

06:37.312 --> 06:48.848
times, I remember just about ready to, you know, my 
attack, to start firing, here's a P-40 coming and

06:37.312 --> 06:48.848
slip, you know, he turned and turned, and he 
slipped right in front of me, and I couldn't shoot.

06:48.963 --> 06:51.967
because he was trying to get in there and shoot too. 
We were just absolutely swarming all of them.

06:53.990 --> 06:55.031
That's the correct word. Just swarming. And 
whether it was another guy flying on my wing, I was

06:56.233 --> 07:01.300
letting him fly forward. You were in the attack 
four. I didn't know yet. You were in the attack

07:03.462 --> 07:04.524
four. What about the other eight now? Pretty soon 
they all came. They couldn't stay out. Oh, no, all

07:10.612 --> 07:12.334
of them. I don't know who shot who down, but I do know 
I came back and had some... I had some holes in my

07:18.730 --> 07:26.583
rear right tail fin, tail stabilizer, and I had to 
have those patched up. And I claimed two

07:26.603 --> 07:34.916
probables, but we saw about four airplanes go down 
during the time we was fighting them. Actually saw

07:34.936 --> 07:39.544
four fall out of formation, because they 
immediately turned and started running. But we

07:40.626 --> 07:45.193
got word from our intelligence that not one single 
airplane of those got back to base. But we only

07:46.439 --> 07:48.742
claimed, I think we claimed credit for four. And we 
divided the four 2,000 bucks among 14 of us,

07:49.303 --> 07:55.791
because we're not sure, you know, who knocked who 
down. And subsequent fights, particularly

07:56.813 --> 08:05.504
between fighters and fighters, you know, where 
you're maneuvering, you know whether you're

07:56.813 --> 08:05.504
going to shoot this guy down or not, because you're 
the only one behind him. Now, did you have a camera

08:05.524 --> 08:07.366
in the nose of the plane? No. We had cameras. We had 
one P-40 that eventually we tried to put a camera in

08:10.711 --> 08:16.378
to use as a reconnaissance airplane, but... The 
basis on which we claimed aircraft was the

08:16.797 --> 08:29.377
polished word plus your wingman or another guy 
seeing it go down. That's the basis on which we

08:29.497 --> 08:32.402
claimed. Sometimes, I dare say there may have been 
a little bit of cheating on it, but I don't think

08:32.422 --> 08:38.491
there was very much. I know this, the number that we 
shot down. For instance, the British

08:43.018 --> 08:44.661
intelligence When we evacuated Burma and, you 
know, then finally ran the Japanese down, the

08:45.637 --> 09:04.984
British intelligence claimed that there were 
almost 600 Japanese airplanes, wrecked

08:45.637 --> 09:04.984
airplanes, found in the southern part of Burma, 
and I know we didn't claim over 120 or something

08:45.637 --> 09:04.984
like that. But, now when these bombers saw you, 
when these ten bombers saw you, did they, did they

09:14.476 --> 09:17.619
try to put up a fight and get to their bombing 
objective? Or did they just turn and run? They

09:18.820 --> 09:24.245
mainly made a gradual turn, stayed in perfect 
formation. They never broke formation. I give

09:25.507 --> 09:26.388
credit for that. Boy, they stayed right in 
formation. See, that's the only defense. Of

09:29.611 --> 09:33.254
course, we'd pick the guys off from each end. We'd 
pick the last man on the Vs. Yeah, because they did

09:33.274 --> 09:42.643
have a little return rear-firing gun in a bucket 
that fell down and went back. The rear gunner would

09:42.824 --> 09:44.365
shoot back. you get behind, you know, get in the 
middle of the V, trying to shoot down the middle one

09:45.593 --> 10:11.289
down, you've got all this fire, where if you come on 
the end, my favorite tactics, and many others did

09:45.593 --> 10:11.289
the same thing, was to get way out, you know, where 
you have altitude, and come down, get, come down

09:45.593 --> 10:11.289
next to him, was to get, pick up speed, and then come 
up at a lower, about a lower quarter attack, and

09:45.593 --> 10:11.289
shoot, and then break off. That was my favorite 
tactic. And that was my best gunnery. had my

10:16.660 --> 10:31.419
gunnery, had I been, you know, had time to be really 
trained, had I been a typical fighter train pilot,

10:16.660 --> 10:31.419
like the average American fighter pilot, I'm sure 
I could have had 50 to 60 airplanes of my credit. But

10:31.439 --> 10:34.724
I just wasn't trained in gunnery, aerial gunnery. 
See, I was, ever since I graduated, I was in B-17.

10:40.231 --> 10:45.097
Uh, so you people did see four drop, and those were 
the last four. Uh, Well, that's when we broke off

10:46.630 --> 10:48.372
the time, see. Why'd you break off the time? Well, 
we were getting, we caught on southeast of, uh, of,

10:50.294 --> 11:16.502
uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, 
uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of,

10:50.294 --> 11:16.502
uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, 
uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of,

10:50.294 --> 11:16.502
uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, 
uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of,

10:50.294 --> 11:16.502
uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of And allow a 
little bit to get maybe lost, you know, in trying to

11:17.039 --> 11:21.323
find yourself again. Pretty soon you break off the 
combat and it, and of course, the little

11:21.904 --> 11:34.456
commercial radios we had, sometimes you hear the 
boss, I mean the commander call in and say, okay,

11:21.904 --> 11:34.456
it's breaking off, go back. And sometimes you 
don't, you just do it on your own. And a lot of our

11:36.958 --> 11:42.844
combat was that way, where they'd just, we'd wait 
until the last one's dragging in. Some guys

11:43.297 --> 11:45.000
wouldn't get back. So you guys were getting low on 
gas? Oh, yeah. Did you lose any of your airplanes?

11:52.074 --> 11:52.455
Oh, yeah. On this particular attack? I

11:54.799 --> 12:03.516
don't think we lost any on that.

12:09.925 --> 12:12.648
Sandy began calling us off and wagging his wings 
for joining us. By this time, we were some 200 miles

12:12.668 --> 12:15.512
from Columbia. Oh, I see. So you were 200 miles. 14 
of us had taken off. Okay. And we couldn't afford to

12:20.398 --> 12:23.321
lose any aircraft after such a fight.

12:28.207 --> 12:29.328
We found a base landing. The strike was followed in 
one by one.

12:37.478 --> 12:38.920
We had critiqued the detail. We could treat the 
flame, detail included. We had gotten four of the

12:41.327 --> 12:43.909
bombers ashore and several more as probable. I 
felt fairly convinced of having contributed to

12:44.289 --> 12:49.034
the loss of that left wingman. We were in high 
spirits, snarled with the ladies. It was our first

12:50.776 --> 12:53.378
test of combat and our first test. We had not lost a 
man. Not a man, no one, no wounded, or no, uh, right?

12:59.504 --> 13:01.746
No.

13:02.827 --> 13:08.232
When on the ground in the parking area, I found in my 
maven's eye a bullet hole in my right aileron,

13:02.827 --> 13:08.232
right stabilizer and rudder. I reflected back now 
about that quiver in my coat. I remember that. I

13:13.995 --> 13:16.938
remember this very day, all of a sudden, I felt it. 
Your airplane was quivering? Yeah, and the stick.

13:19.681 --> 13:20.222
Oh, I see. The rudder, the whole airplane. Boy, you 
get bullet holes in your airplane. So it was

13:25.127 --> 13:33.475
quivering, and you were coming in for a landing, 
and you were— No, no, that's when, actually in

13:25.127 --> 13:33.475
combat, I got the return fire from one of the 
bombers. Oh, I see. See, that's when a bullet hole

13:34.196 --> 13:37.759
went through my—that's when a bullet hole went 
through. Oh, this happened in combat, too. I bet

13:41.641 --> 13:43.887
you Chenault was really happy with you. Oh, yeah. 
And that reminds me, let me make one comment before

13:44.308 --> 13:49.082
I close. I know you're going to ask this question. 
Sure, go right ahead. You know what?

14:21.179 --> 14:26.965
Now this is subsequent to, this one I was down in 
Rangoon later on, but I just want to make this

14:21.179 --> 14:26.965
comment to you now. This was in a fight, I think my 
first fight with Japanese fighters. Well, we're

14:32.271 --> 14:34.113
going to go through all of these. We're going to 
continue on these missions.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.743
Well, this is when I shot down three airplanes in 
combat. Well, we're going to get to that.

14:48.409 --> 14:49.110
Unbelievable. This is our only day. 
Unbelievable. Yet, I subsequently was to see the

14:51.081 --> 14:55.205
same lopsided victories over and over. Expertise 
from training, confidence, and high morale is a

14:55.986 --> 15:02.773
hard combination to beat. When experience is 
added, one becomes super.

15:09.479 --> 15:15.445
To me, that's the explanation of the flying tiger.

15:15.465 --> 15:17.186
We were unbeatable and we knew it. And It wasn't 
Glenn's fault.

15:24.094 --> 15:28.080
That first mission must have really blew them 
around. Well, of course, right after that, the

15:29.081 --> 15:37.134
boys at Rangoon began to get locked in combat 
practically every day. They'd come up with

15:38.957 --> 15:45.507
figures, you know, at the end of the day with nobody 
lost and maybe

15:50.397 --> 15:55.265
maybe 15 shot that. I think one day we shot down 21 
airplanes and ran through them, 21 Japanese and

15:55.285 --> 16:03.938
didn't lose a man. That's in four days of four 
different fights. Well we're going to get to that

16:06.462 --> 16:07.644
now. The first mission you had was the 20th of 
December, what was the next one? For me, well

16:24.316 --> 16:30.464
I don't actually remember getting in a fight with, 
I've scrambled on some flights up at Cunnameen. By

16:30.684 --> 16:33.708
the way, the bomber didn't come over for about two 
or three weeks after that. No. About two or three,

16:36.192 --> 16:38.555
ten days or anything. I remember scrambling 
against- Did he ever hit the city? Never hit the

16:41.679 --> 16:44.062
city again. No. One time about three- Did he ever 
drop any bombs on the city? No. One time about, must

16:47.687 --> 16:53.074
have been April or May. where we were dispersed at 
Chongqing and Kuilin and practically no

16:53.662 --> 16:57.948
airplanes would come in. I think they made a run up 
there and did actually hit the city with two or

16:58.429 --> 17:04.217
three bombers one night. But to answer your 
question about the next fight, I was on several

17:06.340 --> 17:19.078
scrambles out of Kunming where we know bombers 
were on their way up, but they never got to the city

17:06.340 --> 17:19.078
and we never saw them. I don't think I had actual 
contact with the enemy until following late

17:19.278 --> 17:30.917
January when my squadron, or I was, most of my 
squadron was picked to go to Rangoon. Okay. Late

17:33.661 --> 17:35.464
January 1942. At

17:35.484 --> 17:41.194
Rangoon. Tell me about that.

17:59.373 --> 18:28.080
On the...

17:59.373 --> 18:28.080
January the 29th, 1942

17:59.373 --> 18:28.080
was

17:59.373 --> 18:28.080
my first fight at Rangoon and this is when one of 
those typical fights. This is a typical fight we

18:30.203 --> 18:38.395
had at Rangoon and we, our squadron was there until 
the 27th or 28th of February at which time we had to

18:30.203 --> 18:38.395
evacuate. We would fight two to four times a day 
actually meeting the Japanese. I'd say about four

18:44.383 --> 18:46.767
or five times out of each week. And this was what I'm 
about to describe to you. It would be a typical

18:52.155 --> 18:54.558
combat, typical fight. We had a We were at 
Mingledon Air Base, RAF base at Rangoon, and we had

18:58.402 --> 19:25.370
the benefit of an RAF radar that was installed 
nearby to warn of the Japanese coming across from

18:58.402 --> 19:25.370
the full main Singapore

18:58.402 --> 19:25.370
mainland area.

19:25.390 --> 19:25.810
We would take every airplane off we could get off. 
And it'd be anywhere from, say, 8 to 10, maybe 12

19:30.355 --> 19:37.300
sometimes. Plus, the British could touch, but 
they'd have maybe two or three boosters or three or

19:37.320 --> 19:42.785
four Hurricanes. They'd get them off. And we'd all 
scramble, get off just as fast as we could. And

19:47.409 --> 19:54.635
actually, I've seen flights thread each other at 
the intersection of the runway in our haste to get

19:47.409 --> 19:54.635
off. Personally, we never had an aircraft taken 
off. I remember taking off several times, and

19:57.599 --> 20:14.260
instead of going through the normal procedure of 
checking the mags, you know, right and left mags, I

19:57.599 --> 20:14.260
wouldn't do it because I knew darn well I'd have 
such a drop that I'd just have a little bit of doubts

19:57.599 --> 20:14.260
and I wouldn't take off. Who do you mean your mags? 
That's a magneto. Oh, okay. You check the engines.

20:18.706 --> 20:19.186
Okay, okay. And it's normal procedure, and this is 
a proper plane. Sure. And... I knew I wouldn't take

20:28.615 --> 20:29.716
off. I couldn't justify the takeoff, logically. 
Why? Because of bad engine. Oh. And possibility of

20:36.142 --> 20:39.625
it conking out on the air, then you lose the 
airplane. Sure. In other words, it did need some

20:40.766 --> 20:44.309
maintenance on it, tuning up or something. But 
just go ahead and take off. Whatever runs good

20:45.730 --> 20:47.331
enough, you know. And the minute you get off and get 
your wheels tucked up and get all the garbage

20:47.391 --> 20:54.237
tucked in, you know, and flying clean, you begin to 
relax a little. And, of course, then is when you're

20:54.257 --> 20:56.479
getting ready to get to fight. But then you begin to 
relax. That was the most tense minutes is to hear

20:58.788 --> 21:07.082
the scrambles fall. That's the shocking thing. 
Then rush to your airplane, hoping that you can get

21:08.845 --> 21:19.724
in the airplane, get everything on, get the 
engines to it, and get off that runway before the

21:08.845 --> 21:19.724
bomb maybe hits you or a strafe. That's the most 
tense part of any scramble. But then, the minute

21:22.852 --> 21:25.816
you get in the air, see, then you have 
maneuverability. Maybe you get out of the way, and

21:25.876 --> 21:27.558
you see them coming. And you haste to have a chance 
to fight back, because you can point your airplane

21:27.578 --> 21:31.844
at them and shoot. Then you begin to relax a little. 
And then, of course, we'd join up, get up. Then we'd

21:37.372 --> 21:41.538
immediately go to 20,000 feet, and then we'd start 
circling. And like I say, there'd be, well,

21:41.558 --> 21:45.723
there'd be at least a flight of four each. Now, if 
there was an extra two, he'd tack on maybe a flight

21:46.224 --> 21:50.530
of six. And the booster boys, maybe they'd be 
nearby with three or four airplanes, maybe two.

21:57.188 --> 22:04.378
And we'd be generally in the same area where we 
could at least, you know, catch a glimpse of one

21:57.188 --> 22:04.378
another. We wouldn't fly in tight formation. And 
eventually, one of us would see this swirling mass

22:06.681 --> 22:14.412
of Japanese fighters coming over on a fighter 
suite. And I, it looked straight at me. Just a

22:17.056 --> 22:18.779
straight, basically? Uh, yeah. And to catch us in 
combat in the air with the idea of whipping us,

22:19.265 --> 22:23.630
shooting us down. In other words, it was a battle, 
air battle, to eventually wipe us out. They always

22:28.096 --> 22:31.640
thought, I don't know why, they just never would 
learn. They always thought they could destroy us.

22:34.143 --> 22:35.625
They didn't figure we had many airplanes. And they 
were right. We didn't have many. But they just

22:38.188 --> 22:45.617
never did

22:38.188 --> 22:45.617
succeed in knocking us out where we couldn't fight 
back. And... there's no doubt we must have shaken

22:47.648 --> 22:50.671
them up morale-wise. We're bound to because of the 
odds. They knew what they lost. And yet every time

22:54.115 --> 22:57.859
they come over, we still have eight or ten 
airplanes up there. And you can imagine coming

22:57.879 --> 23:05.647
over with 120 airplanes, seeing eight airplanes 
against you, you know darn well, well, these guys

22:57.879 --> 23:05.647
can't have many more. If we just keep up this few 
days, we might lose some, but they're bound to lose

23:05.667 --> 23:10.853
those. Well, we never did. But this is the way we'd 
meet. And it'd be just a looked like a haggle of

23:18.175 --> 23:21.120
bees, a swarm of bees. No formation at all, but they 
would move. For them, for the Japanese, no

23:23.664 --> 23:26.848
formation at all. And they'd move toward, you 
know, always moving towards Rangoon, eventually

23:27.630 --> 23:36.003
in Gages. This is how it was on the 29th of January. 
Right. And somebody saw them, and then, of course,

23:40.850 --> 23:45.938
all of us... They'd give us direction by ground, 
you know, 10 miles north of Pei-Gu, which was a

23:46.745 --> 23:56.822
little town outside of Ran-Gun, or just east of the 
city, and at 18,000, something like that. We

23:56.842 --> 24:01.710
always knew they were around 18,000, so 
altitude-wise, we knew just about where to look.

24:02.932 --> 24:04.174
And eventually, all of us see them. Now, 
sometimes, one flight may never even see this.

24:08.041 --> 24:11.807
You'd think it's impossible with that many 
airplanes in the air. that guys wouldn't be able to

24:12.175 --> 24:16.101
see it, but sometimes you just don't do it. I've 
been up in the air, and sometimes I wouldn't see

24:16.502 --> 24:20.808
them. And boy, it just killed me when I would. It 
just killed me to come back. These guys had been

24:24.855 --> 24:26.377
fighting, and I hadn't seen them. We'd make a point 
to hoover over each other about this. But

24:30.564 --> 24:33.729
eventually we saw all these airplanes, and then 
we'd get in a fight. And again, it was the usual

24:33.789 --> 24:36.613
tactics. Coming down from above and this swirly 
massed airplane, these were little fighters,

24:37.184 --> 24:45.694
little fixed, these were not zeroes at first when 
we met. What were they? These were called I-96s and

24:46.254 --> 24:48.817
I-97s. They were little fixed wing Japanese 
fighters that reminded me of the early P-26. A

24:57.287 --> 25:06.077
little monoplane, low wing, fixed landing gear, 
real sharp looking airplane this day with a radial

24:57.287 --> 25:06.077
engine on it. very maneuverable. They could 
practically turn around in a common 50-foot lock.

25:12.608 --> 25:14.511
What about armament? They had two little 
7.5-millimeter gun guns. That's all? Very light

25:18.275 --> 25:19.176
armament. And practically, I don't know whether 
they even had an armor plate in them or not. How

25:22.080 --> 25:22.781
about speed? Oh, very low compared to the P-40. 
They'd probably cruise. They were an easy prey,

25:27.467 --> 25:28.248
then. Oh, yes. These were. These were. But 
extremely maneuverable. And if you ever let them

25:32.333 --> 25:35.317
get on your tail, then you've had a problem. You've 
just been out couldn't possibly out-turn them.

25:38.587 --> 25:40.769
But you could out-power them. Oh, yeah. So, you 
know, you do tactics. We'd come down and pick one of

25:42.992 --> 25:46.575
them on the end, on the outside of the squirrel. And 
I'd just grab mine, and my tactics were just like

25:47.756 --> 25:51.440
all the rest of them. And I'd come down, pick out one 
guy because of his position. I figured he'd be

25:55.304 --> 26:00.549
about in the right position for me to be on his tail 
when I got in firing position. And I'd just stay

26:00.569 --> 26:05.374
right with him, completely ignoring all the rest 
of them. And as I'd come in, There's your came in.

26:08.753 --> 26:10.275
Okay, you're describing a situation. Yeah, I'm 
coming in on the attack. As I get into position to

26:11.897 --> 26:24.052
shoot, say maybe four or five hundred yards, then 
close, with intention to close practically by

26:11.897 --> 26:24.052
running over it, then I start firing. And I had, as I 
say, a .430 caliber gun and a .250 caliber, hoping

26:24.072 --> 26:32.022
all of them

26:24.072 --> 26:32.022
would fire. Sometimes I'd hold my trigger down too 
long, and I'd fire too long a burst, and heat up my

26:32.339 --> 26:38.108
guns too fast. As a result, I'd have a stoppage on my 
gun and have to cock them again, you know, get them

26:38.668 --> 26:44.297
working again. For the 50s? For the 50s. Not for the 
30s. Well, the 30s, a lot of times they'd get

26:46.620 --> 26:53.170
stopped up, and I'd hit my, I'd go out of control, 
and it wouldn't unstop. Many times I'd go on back to

26:53.210 --> 26:57.957
the base, but none of them were for the 30s working 
at all. But not on this particular plane. No.

26:59.459 --> 27:00.661
You're moving in on this one. Oh, yeah. On this one 
bird on the outside. And I'd close in on him, and

27:03.110 --> 27:14.139
being a normal fighter pilot, he probably knew I 
was coming in on him, and he'd wait until the last

27:03.110 --> 27:14.139
minute to return. Sometimes he wouldn't. But in 
this particular case, now there's many of these I

27:15.801 --> 27:23.267
had, so I'll try to be, this is typical. But just 
give me this example. Coming in on this guy, he saw

27:26.890 --> 27:29.953
me. and turned at the last, very last, at the 
correct second. And I tried to follow, but as I

27:35.247 --> 27:43.015
followed, I'd gotten inside of this mess of 
airplanes, and no doubt there'd been some on my

27:35.247 --> 27:43.015
tail. So I chose not to follow, and I turned off. I 
didn't even get to fire my gun at him. But then I

27:47.840 --> 27:54.226
pulled off the side, gained a little more 
altitude, didn't turn around and come back in, did

27:47.840 --> 27:54.226
the same thing again. This time, I caught one about 
the same way, and I closed in on him and started

27:54.266 --> 28:00.312
firing. And I began to see smoke come off his 
airplane and boil down the side of his cockpit. And

28:07.589 --> 28:15.716
I remember practically, I felt as though I had to 
lift my left wing to get over his right wing as I

28:07.589 --> 28:15.716
passed by him. No kidding. And I looked back. You 
were that close? Oh, yeah. Oh, goodness. You could

28:19.920 --> 28:21.762
have touched him. Well, it seems that close, yeah. 
I'd say easily within 50 feet, no doubt. Did you see

28:28.267 --> 28:30.109
the pilot? No. One time I saw a pilot in an airplane. 
As a matter of fact, it was in the same flight. I

28:38.708 --> 28:43.615
looked back long enough to see this guy trailing 
off and smoke going down and I figured I got him.

28:45.358 --> 28:51.087
Then I remember that was the first airplane I shot 
down. What was your feeling?

28:59.185 --> 29:04.733
I squealed into the light and caught myself 
laughing aloud, sitting there in my cockpit at

28:59.185 --> 29:04.733
some 18,000 feet. Enough for him. Got one. There 
you are, Hoffman, old boy. Just a few days before we

29:10.060 --> 29:13.485
lost Hoffman in a fight with the Japs. He was one of 
the oldest, as a matter of fact, he was the oldest

29:13.525 --> 29:19.794
boy we had from the Navy. And he was in the other 
squadron and was one of the first pilots we lost in

29:19.814 --> 29:25.441
combat. I think we only lost eight. And That was my 
reaction. Related?

29:34.052 --> 29:40.177
It's a hell of a thing to say you're related about 
killing somebody, but related doesn't describe

29:34.052 --> 29:40.177
it. I was exuberant. I was just beside myself. And 
then, of course, I wanted more. So then I pulled off

29:46.743 --> 29:51.287
again to come back. So you banged off him. Yeah, 
yeah. And he was going down. Yeah, to do the same

29:55.371 --> 29:56.692
thing. And of course, all this time, You could look 
across the whole area and you could see, you could

29:58.720 --> 30:05.386
see smoke, streaming smoke of airplanes going 
down. You could actually see, catch out of the

30:05.846 --> 30:12.292
ground, burning airplanes. This is just a mass 
dogfight like you might see in the old movies. And

30:18.377 --> 30:25.183
the next one, I believe the next one was a head-on 
attack. Yeah. I came in and I was going to do my same

30:27.172 --> 30:33.220
little stunt, catching the guy on the end and all. 
But just about time as I was approaching to get in my

30:33.580 --> 30:43.493
firing run, I caught another Jap that evidently 
had seen me and knew what I was going to do. And all of

30:44.033 --> 30:49.320
a sudden here he appeared right in front of me and we 
were hitting directly at each other. And it was

30:51.082 --> 30:53.365
close enough to shoot, so both of us started 
shooting. I could see, you know, when you shoot

30:53.834 --> 30:59.501
your gun, the smoke curls over the wings, 
trailing, and you see the smoke. He was shooting at

30:59.521 --> 31:01.164
me, and I was shooting at him. And I didn't feel 
anything hitting me, but I knew I was hitting him

31:01.845 --> 31:17.285
because I began to see smoke curling coming from 
the Indian cow along the two sides of the airplane.

31:17.305 --> 31:21.310
And at the very last second, I was going to pull up. 
But the very last second, apparently, he was going

31:22.488 --> 31:25.992
to pull up and did. And I don't know how to describe 
it, but just split second thing, you know. And I

31:32.179 --> 31:35.923
started to pull up and then shoved forward 
violently. And when I shoved forward, of course,

31:35.983 --> 31:40.688
that's a negative force. And except for my seat 
belt, I'd have thrown myself right through the

31:40.708 --> 31:44.732
canopy, I'm sure, if it wasn't violent. But my head 
hit the canopy. But everything turned black. as

31:50.315 --> 31:53.159
his airplane passed over me, that's how close he 
was. So we couldn't have missed each other more

31:53.600 --> 31:59.327
than, we couldn't have missed each other more than 
20, 25 feet, even closer. And then, of course, turn

32:00.529 --> 32:06.838
around and look at him, and I saw him going down, and 
I was close enough where I claimed him. Just like

32:08.720 --> 32:09.401
the other one. He went down there right after that. 
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Matter of fact, I think I

32:12.345 --> 32:15.129
followed him down a little. And I was, I remember I 
was so tense and tight that, you know, just hardly

32:19.745 --> 32:21.808
breathing. And then, not exuberant, but, you 
know, just tense. And then as I watched him go down,

32:27.315 --> 32:34.085
then I began to relax, and I started to get elated 
and exuberant again. God damn, two or something

32:34.285 --> 32:37.269
like that. And then, after I was over, I started 
again, and this time I... They just keep doing

32:44.239 --> 32:47.984
this. That's their formation. Why didn't they 
stay in the middle? Why didn't they move out? Why

32:53.908 --> 32:58.533
did they stick together just as a beehive?

32:59.554 --> 33:03.459
Seemingly mutually supporting one another. And 
of course we just picked off the side of them. Sure.

33:08.144 --> 33:09.345
Especially with a quicker flying. Yeah, and then 
the next one I think was similar to the first one

33:09.405 --> 33:13.710
where I got him on a rear attack. And by this time... 
Tell me about that. Tell me about this. Well, it's

33:19.825 --> 33:20.866
similar to the first. I think I caught him from the 
rear. And, oh, this is when I came past him, and our

33:23.389 --> 33:37.125
speed differentiation was so small that I 
actually passed him and could see him sitting in

33:23.389 --> 33:37.125
fire in a cockpit. But, you know, just a quick pass 
to look over. Say about 50 feet apart. So you came up

33:41.010 --> 33:43.312
behind him. Yes. Similar to the first one, yeah. 
And how far were you when you started shooting?

33:51.222 --> 33:54.186
Oh, again, probably four or five hundred yards. 
And then you just close up, you know, practically

33:54.206 --> 33:56.349
run over him. And then he got to move over to get by 
him. And he was obviously, I obviously killed him,

33:58.472 --> 34:06.323
you know, way back because he didn't make any 
effort to move at all. He just stayed right in the

34:06.364 --> 34:11.671
same position, smoke coming back, black smoke, 
and then he started going down real slow. And as I

34:11.691 --> 34:13.013
passed by him, He was sitting in fire in the 
cockpit. He was on fire? Oh yeah, he was dead.

34:18.450 --> 34:20.713
Otherwise, he was bailed out. Sure. I don't ever 
remember seeing Daphne bail out. What did you feel

34:29.925 --> 34:32.728
like when you saw this man on fire? Well, I just 
exuberant again. You know,

34:35.932 --> 34:42.460
you don't get like a... a madman you just get by then 
you get coldly calculating daring

34:43.199 --> 35:10.270
confident you know you can do it sure

34:43.199 --> 35:10.270
you're you've won nothing can hold you back it's 
feeling of winning in As a combat pilot, a pilot has

35:10.807 --> 35:13.912
a feeling of being victorious. You're good. 
You've done your job. And you just feel elated. Not

35:21.623 --> 35:22.224
nervous. The actual firing and attacking and 
seeing him on fire, it's tense. But it's just like

35:33.160 --> 35:35.043
I'm telling you, it's fitness. But then when you, 
the afterthought or before is when you get tense.

35:38.853 --> 35:41.777
and nervous about it, and a little bit scared 
maybe. Of course, in between these attacks I'm

35:43.018 --> 35:54.533
telling you about, I actually had made some 
attacks and had to break it off because I found

35:43.018 --> 35:54.533
airplanes on my tail, but they weren't close 
enough to hit me. You were out of their range. Oh,

35:56.695 --> 35:57.036
yeah. You continually, continually got your head 
on a pedestal. If a guy doesn't get on your tail, you

36:00.760 --> 36:06.247
can't get shot down. That's the old days. It 
doesn't in the day for missiles, but in the old days

36:08.182 --> 36:10.925
for guns. It's true. Subsequently, in the story 
later on, I didn't do that and I got shot at. But by

36:16.432 --> 36:20.597
that time, you know, we were nearing the end of 
combat. The airplanes, you don't see many of your

36:20.677 --> 36:31.469
P-40s around and their flights broken up more and 
they started back, they make this swoop at 180

36:20.677 --> 36:31.469
degrees and they're going back home. So, you know, 
the fight's over. You just have, you know when to

36:32.911 --> 36:34.593
quit. So, how long did the fight take? You shot 
three down that day. That whole flight probably

36:39.472 --> 36:42.595
took thirty-five minutes. That's all?

36:46.138 --> 36:51.203
The longest time it takes is to climb the altitude, 
get there, then when you see them, all that time. I

36:53.225 --> 37:06.758
dare say the actual

36:53.225 --> 37:06.758
combat shooting those three airplanes, and 
probably one problem, actually the three

36:53.225 --> 37:06.758
airplanes, one problem was it probably took— Tell 
me about the problem. It's one I wasn't sure of.

37:08.669 --> 37:10.172
Probably the same type of attack. I'd have to read 
this to...

37:16.842 --> 37:17.964
It's the same type of attack. Okay, but the whole 
thing takes about 35 minutes. The whole thing

37:21.570 --> 37:27.480
takes about 35 minutes, but the actual fighting, 
engaging, couldn't take over 10 minutes. Except

37:29.062 --> 37:31.125
for 8 minutes. That's always the way it is. And then 
when you get down, you know, then of course, we're

37:32.742 --> 37:39.351
not in formation with each other, but when you 
start breaking off a meeting, you start looking

37:32.742 --> 37:39.351
for a buddy. And no matter who it is, if it's P-40, 
you go up and get together. You join. He may have

37:44.217 --> 37:47.342
been your wingman, now you're flying on his wing, 
but you get together. And then you start going back

37:47.382 --> 37:56.894
to the base, and we'd arrive back to the base in 
twos, ones, threes, and, you know, very seldom,

37:47.382 --> 37:56.894
very seldom in the same, if ever. I can, well, maybe 
one or two, I return to the base with, maybe my

38:01.598 --> 38:06.383
wingman on the same position, but very, very 
seldom. Now, this is the... Oh, did the Japanese

38:06.403 --> 38:10.448
just start moving away then? Then they go back 
home. I mean, they had decided they'd had enough,

38:12.030 --> 38:15.534
right? So did they make up their mind at this 
particular battle on the 29th of January, did they

38:15.554 --> 38:24.204
make up their mind first that they'd had enough, or 
did you people? Well, it's a tactic. See, they can

38:25.325 --> 38:31.572
only fly so far and so long because of fuel, but 
can't last too long, and... We know that, and they

38:31.889 --> 38:33.411
know it. So it's almost a set pattern. You don't 
just...

38:39.499 --> 38:47.410
The time element is always in your mind, and where 
you are, the navigation, has to always be in your

38:39.499 --> 38:47.410
mind, or you'll never make it back. Or you'll run 
out of gas. So it's just automatically when you

38:49.172 --> 38:52.837
break off. And it's experience. It's experience. 
And then we get back, and of course we...

39:00.998 --> 39:15.817
Sometimes, if there's no worries about more 
attacks or more waves of bombers or fighters

39:00.998 --> 39:15.817
coming over, we'd by ourselves, we'd come over to 
the field and do a slow roll, a victory roll, pull up

39:00.998 --> 39:15.817
and land. Then we'd get down, of course, we'd get 
together and have a critique and discuss all of

39:16.238 --> 39:21.825
that. That's the way, by the end of one day, I forget 
when it was, it was the latter part of February,

39:22.042 --> 39:30.913
we'd been fighting about four, we'd fought the 
Japanese four times in one day. And you see, this

39:31.394 --> 39:35.579
was toward the end of the campaign when they were 
about, well, they did force us out. See, the

39:35.599 --> 39:36.961
intensity was such. And they achieved their 
objective, they forced us out. We just drew the

39:41.126 --> 39:42.889
rate from Rangoon. Then the ground forces, see, 
were moving forward too. So if we'd stayed there

39:45.552 --> 39:51.019
another 24 hours, we may not have got our ground 
force up the highway enough. We actually

39:51.455 --> 40:00.506
patrolled them the day we evacuated to be sure that 
if any Japanese coming across the ground were

39:51.455 --> 40:00.506
attacked, we'd at least give them some air 
support.

40:03.249 --> 40:15.123
I'm rambling an awful lot, but

40:03.249 --> 40:15.123
you came back and you critiqued this battle of the 
29th of January before we get to the ones in

40:03.249 --> 40:15.123
February. What did your men think? Of course. How 
many did you lose? We didn't lose any. You didn't

40:23.103 --> 40:24.006
lose any. And how many did you claim? How many 
victories did you claim?

40:49.167 --> 40:50.429
I decided to call it a day. After all, I was getting 
too far eastward from the field. Nearing the field

40:53.935 --> 40:58.563
and after checking the tower, I did a slow roll 
across the runway of the first victory roll in my

40:53.935 --> 40:58.563
life. Landed and taxied toward the alert area at 
the top center of the field.

41:05.695 --> 41:09.762
While taxiing past the revetment, I saw quite a 
crowd around one side of the enclosure. Closer

41:10.403 --> 41:13.588
observation revealed a crashed Jap I-97 fighter. 
Japanese pilot had apparently been shot out of the

41:14.378 --> 41:22.389
air and he was making a last suicidal attempt to 
crash into an old RAF Blenheim bomber in a

41:14.378 --> 41:22.389
revetment on the field. See, all this fighting was 
going on over the field, practically, which was

41:23.270 --> 41:27.956
sheltered in a revetment. He had missed it by only a 
few feet. An RAF airman, I want to read this to you

41:29.959 --> 41:37.068
because I remember this so well. An RAF airman held 
up a leather helmet with a Japanese pilot's head

41:39.556 --> 41:44.802
still in it with parts of his throat hanging down in 
a bloody mess. With his other hand, he pointed two

41:45.743 --> 41:50.548
fingers skyward and the usual V for victory sign. I 
returned the V sign and texted on. I could not,

41:52.651 --> 41:55.074
however, return it broad grin.

41:58.397 --> 41:59.258
So this RAF man? Ground man, yeah. Did the ground 
man cut the Japanese head? No, no, in a crash.

42:05.105 --> 42:06.406
Severed in a crash. In a crash, yeah, yeah. 
Incidentally, I went over later on and got a gun

42:07.737 --> 42:12.965
charging handle out of that airplane as a 
souvenir. I still have it. A what handle? They

42:16.971 --> 42:22.399
charge the gun manually with a little handle 
that's got a wire on it, you know, that goes with the

42:16.971 --> 42:22.399
gun in the wing. You just pull it up like you do a 
stutter lawnmower. It's written in Japanese

42:25.964 --> 42:28.688
letters, a gun charger, I guess. I don't know.

42:32.594 --> 42:34.817
We critiqued our expenses over a cup of coffee. 
There must have been at least I say 35 of these

42:37.437 --> 42:39.559
fighters. We figured we got at least 16 of them. I 
now believe I have shot down two aircraft. I had it

42:44.706 --> 42:50.973
last done something.

42:50.993 --> 42:52.094
Now, you said three. Three, yeah. Just a couple 
minutes ago, and your diary says two. Well, this

42:56.019 --> 43:01.245
is the fight where I only got two. I'll have to 
describe the fight later on where I got three now.

43:04.769 --> 43:04.969
Okay. So you'll believe me. Okay, this is... This 
is the 29th of January, and you shot two? Two. Oh,

43:12.759 --> 43:14.540
two in one probable. Two in one probable, okay. I 
now believe I have shot down two aircraft. I had at

43:19.546 --> 43:20.567
least done something. So that last one that you 
came up on, that was another fight probably? Yeah.

43:25.532 --> 43:31.358
So you shot one down how you described it, and the 
second one how you described it, and then you got

43:25.532 --> 43:31.358
a... In other words, did you see that? Was the man 
that you saw on fire, was... That's what I'm trying

43:36.466 --> 43:37.967
to think of. I remember that so vividly that that 
may have been in the subject. Maybe that was on

43:41.891 --> 43:43.212
another flight. When I get your manuscript, I'll 
check this out. Now, this is as far as I got when the

43:50.219 --> 43:58.426
first chapter, I don't know, May page, well, 
chapter 126. Now, I'll have to,

43:58.906 --> 44:05.072
well, this type of fighting went on. This was the 
next day was the 30th of January. And how long did

44:09.581 --> 44:13.908
you stay in Rangoon in these types of dogfights? 
30th of January. From the 29th of January until the

44:15.792 --> 44:23.365
22nd of Rangoon.

44:38.566 --> 44:47.820
27th is

44:38.566 --> 44:47.820
Rangoon.

44:47.920 --> 45:06.008
I call these

44:47.920 --> 45:06.008
chapters, but chapter 155 is the 155th day since I 
left. San Francisco, but the day is 27 February

45:06.258 --> 45:11.544
1942 in Rangoon.

45:14.428 --> 45:16.070
And that's when you left? The 27th of February? 
Yeah. 28th, yeah. So you were there from the 29th of

45:21.476 --> 45:24.980
January until the 27th of February. That's right. 
And English breakfast is something new to be

45:26.822 --> 45:30.687
compared with that. Okay. Okay, so when... That 
was the mission of the 29th of January, where you

45:33.747 --> 45:37.832
hit two and one probable. What was your, and you 
were doing, you were having a lot of these

45:38.413 --> 45:47.704
dogfights during that entire month then, during 
the month of February. I think when I left,

45:48.125 --> 45:54.553
I got credit for two and a half at Chiang Mai. I think 
when I left there, I had seven aircraft to my

45:56.035 --> 45:59.579
credit.

46:02.402 --> 46:02.723
Okay. Yeah. Because I was officially paid for nine 
and a quarter airplanes. Okay, so you had two and a

46:08.452 --> 46:10.094
half. No, you don't get paid for half. In that case, 
probably, we didn't get paid for half. Oh, okay.

46:18.902 --> 46:29.032
But in the raid at Chiang Mai, Thailand, which I'll 
tell you later on about, I was paid for nine and a

46:18.902 --> 46:29.032
quarter airplanes. On the raid at Chiang Mai, we— 
burned up so many airplanes there that we just

46:32.742 --> 46:39.113
divided them amongst the four of us that attacked. 
And it came out where I got two and a quarter.

46:42.639 --> 46:44.843
Because we couldn't prove anything. And got 
credit for two and a quarter. So that left me seven

46:46.706 --> 46:48.329
airplanes. And I didn't shoot any airplanes down.
