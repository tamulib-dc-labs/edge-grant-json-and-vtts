00:04.705 --> 00:15.160
Well, if you were to kind of start... Well, just to 
continue, you saw them going to school every day in

00:04.705 --> 00:15.160
their little uniforms and that. So there was a... 
And I don't think it was just upper class. I think

00:20.668 --> 00:24.874
everyone had an opportunity to be educated. I just 
didn't see... I saw very few what you may call

00:26.136 --> 00:31.303
street urchins roaming around. Oh, there 
weren't? No, there weren't. You know, there

00:33.595 --> 00:36.698
weren't any gangs or anything like that, I didn't 
see. Now, it so happened that the procurement

00:36.818 --> 00:48.010
agency was located in the prostitution district. 
In your agency? That's where it was. It was right

00:49.811 --> 00:51.713
down on Plantation Road. Is that what you call it? 
That's right. So, there was that going on there,

00:55.717 --> 01:00.362
but... But as I say, the Vietnamese, and just like 
the Thais, had great respect for youth, and the

01:01.608 --> 01:12.741
parents loved their children. Very touching. Not 
very touching, but very admirable. You said even

01:16.345 --> 01:21.291
you felt like all classes went to school. Was there 
a great class society? I mean, can you tell a big

01:23.934 --> 01:25.737
distinction? I think there was a class. It was more 
by education than by money. Education probably

01:32.253 --> 01:39.363
made the distinction, you know, than money. Was 
there a lot of money? Didn't you have a lot of money?

01:47.113 --> 01:52.500
I really couldn't tell, but I don't think...

01:54.984 --> 01:56.326
I didn't see poverty there. Let's put it that way. I 
did not see poverty. I didn't see poverty in

01:59.630 --> 02:01.753
Thailand either. And I didn't see it, now we don't 
know, I don't know whether it was, hey, the wartime

02:02.645 --> 02:12.663
economy in Saigon meant there was a lot of money 
around because everybody could get a job. But I

02:13.684 --> 02:15.648
would sort of suspect that was it. There was a lot of 
money around and everybody could get a job. Do you

02:20.136 --> 02:25.986
think this was because of the contract we were 
having that a certain ratio had to be Vietnamese? I

02:26.236 --> 02:36.552
don't know whether that was it, but they're 
probably very industrious people, and even

02:26.236 --> 02:36.552
without that, they were getting a spillover, 
maybe not such a direct spillover. When we say 20%

02:36.572 --> 02:45.206
to Vietnamese, that meant 20% of our in-country 
expenditures were going directly to the

02:36.572 --> 02:45.206
Vietnamese. But even before that, I think it would 
have probably reached the Vietnamese, but maybe

02:45.647 --> 02:51.977
through one or two middlemen, you know? Right. But 
I think we were making sure that more got down to the

02:52.510 --> 02:59.539
Vietnamese. That was, as I said, both through the 
contractors and requiring contractors to employ

02:59.559 --> 03:06.709
Vietnamese. And I

03:07.590 --> 03:19.345
didn't see anything which would be indicative of 
graft or corruption. Do you have any certain

03:21.350 --> 03:27.802
personal relationship with the Vietnamese 
person? No, it was just all business. Although I

03:29.666 --> 03:33.593
got that vase up there from the young lady in the 
office. But we all liked it so much that when I went

03:33.813 --> 03:44.353
to Hong Kong on a R&R,

03:33.813 --> 03:44.353
we bought her a typewriter from the office. 
Because we felt that she could use this at home or

03:44.941 --> 03:51.768
maybe a little business or the rest of it. So 
everybody in the office chipped in and we got her a

03:52.108 --> 03:57.153
typewriter, among other things. Is she still over 
there now? I would guess so. I really lost touch. In

04:06.682 --> 04:10.806
fact, I didn't maintain any touch with anybody. I 
don't usually when I'm over there. Right. because

04:13.173 --> 04:42.572
it's profitless and I don't mean that from the 
monetary sense I mean that from the emotional

04:13.173 --> 04:42.572
sense it's profitless what we had in common is God 
I'm not there anymore and you're there so I don't

04:13.173 --> 04:42.572
maintain any relationship with people I've 
served with before very rare exception what we had

04:13.173 --> 04:42.572
in common was our service together that's over and 
I'm going on to new friends And you're going on to

04:42.873 --> 04:44.295
new friends. If we meet again, we'll be friends 
again, but... We're going on. That's right.

04:48.642 --> 04:50.164
Everybody goes forward. Right. Well, if you were 
going to sum up your experience in Vietnam, what

04:50.905 --> 04:55.572
would you say? I would say it was entirely worth it. 
I would say entirely worth it in every respect. I

05:01.121 --> 05:02.343
like the experience. I like the service.

05:07.210 --> 05:10.315
I thought we were trying to do some good there. I 
never felt a sense that we were being rejected by

05:10.936 --> 05:18.866
the Vietnamese people, that we were doing 
something unpopular. And you might say, well, in

05:19.367 --> 05:27.056
Saigon, where everybody was under the thumb of the 
police, you think that is realistic. But I was out

05:27.137 --> 05:28.699
in the country, too. And people were either the 
ones that I had an opportunity to see were either

05:29.480 --> 05:40.133
for us or, at worst, indifferent. But I saw we did a 
lot of good, I thought, with the

05:41.412 --> 05:50.601
economy. And I only saw the best of motives towards 
the .. Only the best of

05:51.021 --> 05:58.548
motives. And to say, hey, such a nice and wonderful 
and fine people, you're first certainly going to

05:58.568 --> 06:09.799
feel a certain remorse that something like this 
had to happen. When

06:10.302 --> 06:23.437
you talked about the countrymen, the country 
people that you saw, do you feel like there was more

06:10.302 --> 06:23.437
indifference out there than there really was 
feelings? Did a lot of people just live their own

06:23.837 --> 06:25.919
lives? Well, they tried to. They tried to. But in 
some way or not, in some way they're certainly

06:29.503 --> 06:35.730
going to be involved. But you're going to get... 
people very well in the combat zones, in the fire

06:40.475 --> 06:54.448
zones, certainly couldn't be indifferent to it 
because they were threatened every day from

06:40.475 --> 06:54.448
either one side or the other. Maybe not 
intentionally, but the threat was there when you

06:54.488 --> 07:08.001
drop that many explosives and you engage in that 
sort of violence, one no matter how innocent or

06:54.488 --> 07:08.001
how... the desire to keep out of the way, you do 
become involved. Just like even in Saigon, we were

07:13.982 --> 07:20.448
involved with the little terrorist activities 
and the rest of it. You're always conscious of

07:21.408 --> 07:24.171
that. Even in the hotel room or going to and from 
work, I always carried a pistol and carried it on my

07:24.351 --> 07:38.443
lap because... You didn't know who was out there. 
That's

07:41.880 --> 07:46.966
right, that's right, that's right, that's right. 
And you always figured that if you were prepared,

07:46.986 --> 07:52.252
the person might go along and pick on somebody 
else. So even though you were in Saigon, as well as I

07:53.053 --> 07:57.177
said, there was always that fear. Well, always 
that vigilance. Vigilance would be a word. Oh, you

08:01.702 --> 08:05.847
never let that vigilance down. You were always 
concerned. At least I was. I was always concerned,

08:10.185 --> 08:26.661
always aware that you figured that the more 
vigilant you were, the less of a target you would

08:10.185 --> 08:26.661
appear to be, less of an attractive target you 
would appear to be. And everybody, everybody

08:26.941 --> 08:29.704
carried guns. Everybody had guns. And they 
treated them with respect. Respect, I mean, it

08:34.829 --> 08:35.970
was. It was just like you would, you yourself would 
carry your purse to school. When you got up in the

08:40.851 --> 08:43.154
morning, you put on the gun. Went to work. You 
carried it, you loaded it, it was loaded, and you

08:45.177 --> 08:50.404
kept it in, on driving in the car, you kept it in your 
lap. And so it was always, you never went out

08:51.786 --> 08:55.251
without it. Never went out without it. So I would 
say, hey, the Vietnamese people were concerned,

09:01.039 --> 09:04.303
and There had to be, too, because I remember that 
they would run convoys through the city, and

09:05.093 --> 09:16.010
Vietnamese traffic is just like any other 
Oriental city. So I got a great deal of traffic.

09:19.776 --> 09:33.177
Now, these convoys, what they would do is they 
would get these five-ton trucks, and they would

09:19.776 --> 09:33.177
run through the city with their horns going, and 
they wouldn't stop. They would jump one stop and

09:34.979 --> 09:43.409
maybe it would be about, and going about 40 miles an 
hour through the crowded streets. 40 miles an hour

09:44.009 --> 09:49.916
might not seem to you, but through crowded streets 
and a lot of intersections. But you knew that you

09:49.996 --> 09:58.086
could hear those horns going, those air horns, 
maybe about a half a mile away. And you knew you

09:58.807 --> 10:02.691
better get out of the way because they did not stop 
for lights. They did not stop at anything. In a

10:04.678 --> 10:09.265
five-ton truck, he would just run over you, and he 
wouldn't even feel it. He'd just keep going. Keep

10:10.807 --> 10:11.288
going. So it was those kind of things that was 
always, I would imagine,

10:11.308 --> 10:28.233
caused the local populace to always be constantly 
reminded that something was going on. Do you think

10:28.253 --> 10:32.880
after the UN was met in the Vietnam War, Now, when we 
got involved with another country, would we be

10:33.316 --> 10:40.224
careful of getting involved? Well, I think you can 
see that in Central America. Everybody's

10:44.629 --> 10:45.550
concerned. They've got it on their mind. We don't 
want it to be another Vietnam. This is only the

10:48.533 --> 10:51.076
beginning of involvement. I see that on the 
television each night. Nobody can say, hey, we

10:53.178 --> 10:57.763
shouldn't give aid to these people. This is the 
beginning of another Vietnam. Do you think that's

11:00.940 --> 11:05.246
a true statement, or do you think it's a statement 
to say, yeah? Well, I don't know how, I don't really

11:05.266 --> 11:08.190
know how true it is. The really thing is we have to, I 
think we have to probably decide for ourselves

11:08.210 --> 11:16.120
whether it's going to involve another Vietnam or 
not. Is it necessary to become involved?

11:20.066 --> 11:25.153
Apparently when we became involved in Vietnam, 
people thought it was necessary. Maybe they

11:25.193 --> 11:29.158
didn't have the foresight to see that it would end 
in that manner. But now that they have one

11:30.590 --> 11:55.247
experience, I think we will not be influenced 
by... Oh, yes, we probably will be influenced by

11:30.590 --> 11:55.247
Vietnam in that people will make the decision a lot 
more carefully, saying we will become involved

11:30.590 --> 11:55.247
even if it becomes a Vietnam or we won't become 
involved because it's not worth it. Do you think

11:55.936 --> 12:01.625
that people that came home from Vietnam got to talk 
about it or was it hushed up? I think they talked

12:01.645 --> 12:06.012
about it as much as they wanted to. I think if you 
wanted to talk about Vietnam, you could. I never

12:08.175 --> 12:15.547
had any problem with people saying, don't talk 
about it, or I talked with people who were over

12:08.175 --> 12:15.547
there. We always talked about it. people who've 
been over there, why did you do, how was it, what

12:17.063 --> 12:21.969
were your experiences? So I didn't, I've never 
found any reticence by anybody to talk about it if

12:21.989 --> 12:28.857
they wanted to. But people just, just over and done 
with it. So you wouldn't take, you'd go again? Oh,

12:37.448 --> 12:39.050
sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. Well, maybe it's 
because I didn't have any unhappy experiences

12:39.090 --> 12:45.838
there, except, you know, what ultimately 
happened to the people. That's got to be unhappy.

12:49.690 --> 12:51.092
That's got to be sad for us all. But yes, the 
experience was just good. It's like all military

12:58.982 --> 13:04.870
experience in the world, but just a question of 
degree. Well, thank you for letting me in. OK.
