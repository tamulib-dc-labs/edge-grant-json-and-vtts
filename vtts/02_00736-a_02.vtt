WEBVTT

00:03.558 --> 00:06.221
Besides mapping, how about programs? Were there 
any industrial programs that you instituted? No.

00:12.890 --> 00:23.223
Shortly after I got here, I realized that this was 
essentially a fire outfit. Nothing else really

00:23.464 --> 00:24.805
counted. Sort of piddled around with a nursery, 
too.

00:31.435 --> 00:38.466
I thought, well, what do we need here in the 
organization is a man who knows something about

00:31.435 --> 00:38.466
silviculture.

00:40.829 --> 00:45.777
And, of course, I was biased about that because 
that was one of the subjects I taught at LSU. So I

00:46.979 --> 00:57.375
contacted a man who at one time worked with me on a 
project over in Louisiana by the name of Vaux, who

00:46.979 --> 00:57.375
later became head of the School of Forestry at the 
University of California at Berkeley. And I asked

01:03.033 --> 01:18.674
him whether he could suggest someone who might be 
interested in coming to the South, who has had a

01:03.033 --> 01:18.674
good basis in silviculture and plant physiology. 
He recommended somebody. We had an interview. He

01:23.681 --> 01:24.622
was employed. And that's how we got started. I'd 
say one of my principal accomplishments here,

01:27.545 --> 01:33.332
research in tree improvement. Okay, now this is 
later, because you said a while ago, you know, in

01:34.873 --> 01:41.861
initial parts you got rid of a kind of a useless 
silvicultural program. And so what, then you

01:41.881 --> 01:46.787
waited until you had more money in your budget to be 
able to operate this time? Well, got a little more

01:47.027 --> 01:53.455
money, and I got enough money to employ this fellow 
as a silviculturist. Now, he was in the management

01:54.536 --> 01:56.438
department. He wasn't... Still no silvicultural 
research. No, no. As a matter of fact, there still

02:01.259 --> 02:06.163
isn't any silvicultural research per se. There is 
research in tree improvement in the forest

02:06.684 --> 02:12.729
management department. Now, you say I'm 
nitpicking? No, no. I can understand it, though.

02:19.896 --> 02:20.756
Okay. I think. Because with a very limited... and 
the Texas Forest Service has, it should be engaged

02:25.949 --> 02:35.003
in only that sort of research that isn't 
obtainable elsewhere. And this was the first

02:35.704 --> 02:40.771
research in tree improvement in the whole South. 
As a matter of fact, almost in the whole nation. The

02:43.836 --> 02:50.225
only other place that it was being done was on a very 
limited scale in the Lake States and out in

02:43.836 --> 02:50.225
California. The Nelson, I mean the Eddy Tree 
Breeding Station. Maybe you'll run across that or

02:55.767 --> 03:04.698
have, but... No, I have avoided, for the most part, 
real technical things that I don't understand.

03:04.719 --> 03:04.819
Okay. I've avoided them because if I run across it, 
the only thing that I can ever read that I've read

03:05.459 --> 03:23.262
about that was of any research value was done by 
accident, and it was planting slash pines in 1926,

03:05.459 --> 03:23.262
and lo and behold, those things grew fast, and they 
noticed it, and were able somehow to convince

03:05.459 --> 03:23.262
industry. I guess... I don't know how they did it. I 
don't have enough information to tell them. They

03:27.739 --> 03:30.602
must have brought them in there and said, look, 
these things grow fast. And somebody tried them.

03:32.263 --> 03:35.586
Well, there were experimental plantings down in 
the Siki State Forest. Yes, in 1926 those first

03:35.606 --> 03:38.789
plantings were made. And I've seen pictures, and 
they grew very fast. I've got them in my yard. They

03:42.412 --> 03:43.273
grow fast. I have no doubt about it. They shouldn't 
be planted here. You're abusing nature when you

03:46.096 --> 03:48.698
plant a pine tree here. I know. Well, all the roots 
are on top of the ground. One of these days it's

03:51.561 --> 03:53.803
going to fall on the house. Okay. It'll get even 
with me.

04:00.052 --> 04:02.415
But evidently the things caught on. Yeah, it is. 
And they're getting away from Slash Pie now

04:04.437 --> 04:10.383
because it's, oh, this is a technical aspect. 
Yeah, well, it was an interest and it caught on.

04:13.766 --> 04:14.087
Okay. Do you have any other questions? One, no, I 
don't have a whole lot. If that's what you saw,

04:19.732 --> 04:22.255
well, yeah, one more, one quick one. What was the 
South Central Interstate Forest Fire Protection

04:23.028 --> 04:26.733
Compact? Well, that was an arrangement whereby we 
could

04:26.753 --> 04:47.922
call on adjoining states for assistance because 
we had an acute forest fire situation and because

04:26.753 --> 04:47.922
of liabilities

04:49.589 --> 04:58.098
one state agency would be most reluctant to 
dispatch anybody to an adjoining state because of

04:49.589 --> 04:58.098
liability in case of injury. And that's why it was 
set up, created, so that there would be no

04:59.099 --> 05:12.252
reluctance for Texas men to go into Louisiana or 
Arkansas and vice versa for assistance. Did you

05:12.933 --> 05:13.714
all ever do that? Yeah. We used the compact in a few 
cases, but Now we have all gotten to the point where

05:19.880 --> 05:27.209
we're large enough so that we can take care of 
practically any situation that develops. Did you

05:27.890 --> 05:29.332
set this up? Or were you involved in setting it up? I 
was involved in setting it up, yeah. Where did this

05:32.616 --> 05:33.617
come about? Is this jawboning with the other guys 
and decided we needed to do it? Well, see there's a

05:36.861 --> 05:40.766
National Association of State Foresters, has 
been for a long time. And I first learned about it

05:41.968 --> 05:47.895
because they had what was known as the New England 
Compact, The U.S. Forest Service, I think, was

05:48.584 --> 05:54.471
responsible for organizing that compact up there 
in the New England states. Well, that was a good

05:54.892 --> 05:58.796
idea, and some of us thought it had application 
down there. So we decided to create one here. Do you

06:02.380 --> 06:07.527
remember what date that was set up?

06:07.547 --> 06:09.649
Well, I can merely give you an approximation. The 
office would have a record on this. I would say

06:13.994 --> 06:17.038
about...

06:22.047 --> 06:25.351
56, 57, 55 maybe. I don't remember. Okay. I was just 
curious about that. One last thing that just

06:28.936 --> 06:34.464
dawned on me and I wanted to ask about the advisory 
committee. Was this done in any other states? I

06:38.108 --> 06:38.789
don't think so. So you innovated it? It's an 
innovation, I think. Okay. I just wondered where

06:43.696 --> 06:45.739
you were drawing on past experience. Well, you see 
in other places there's a Arkansas, for example,

06:49.368 --> 06:54.818
has a forestry commission where industry is 
represented on this commission. They have a

06:54.878 --> 06:57.423
similar situation in Louisiana or did. Oh, I see. 
Okay, okay. So that's, yeah, that's very nice.

07:01.570 --> 07:03.514
That's a good point. Okay, so it gets industry back 
into the picture again that way without the

07:03.534 --> 07:07.942
commission. Right. Marvelous. In these meetings 
that you have with the advisory committee, Did

07:14.225 --> 07:16.809
they tell you what they wanted? Sometimes. I 
wouldn't say that it was particularly

07:19.033 --> 07:26.766
revolutionary, but it did this. It established 
the fact that the Texas Forest Service was

07:28.529 --> 07:37.043
interested in establishing communication with 
industry. Because I had gotten a complaint from

07:38.677 --> 07:44.565
one of the lumbermen, well, we don't know what the 
Texas Forest Service is doing. And so you could sit

07:46.628 --> 07:52.456
down and say, this, fellas, is what we can do, or 
this is what we can do for you? Yeah. This is what we

07:53.938 --> 07:54.920
can't do? Yeah. Also, this was a means of 
mobilizing some legislative input. I don't know

08:03.412 --> 08:04.313
if you... A form of lobbying, you can say. 
Certainly, because these men had their

08:07.284 --> 08:10.691
legislators, didn't they? Sure. You've got a big 
business going. And I'm sure this was a big help in

08:14.198 --> 08:20.591
getting any programs through that you wanted, or 
your budget especially. Don't overlook the fact

08:20.631 --> 08:26.723
also that simultaneously with my coming here, the 
Texas forest industry had a representative on the

08:27.361 --> 08:34.357
board of directors in the form of Al Cudlip. Yes, 
that's in this. And I think this is some important

08:36.001 --> 08:43.277
point I've got to include in this, is that when 
Cudlip came, it almost seems like... You were

08:44.843 --> 08:46.985
lucky of coming at the right time. Yeah, right. I 
got a break there. I have no reluctance in

08:48.627 --> 08:51.110
admitting that. Suddenly that somebody was 
interested in you doing well. He thought he was

08:54.754 --> 09:04.184
going to have more influence directly on the Texas 
Forest Service than he ever did because Gib

08:54.754 --> 09:04.184
Dilchrist disillusioned him in a hurry on that 
point. Did he get rid of Gib? Oh, no. He didn't help

09:08.969 --> 09:10.130
to get rid of Gib? No, I don't think so. Later on they 
got together all right. But Al recognized that he

09:12.839 --> 09:19.327
shouldn't be messing directly with the Texas 
Forest Service. He withdrew. I think Gibb merely

09:22.110 --> 09:28.618
told him how the cow ate the cabbage and that's all 
that was to it. I can see that. Did they leave you

09:32.042 --> 09:33.304
alone? Did the university or the system leave you 
alone? Sure did. Is there not a good thing and a bad

09:37.589 --> 09:40.112
thing in that? It had its strengths. It's nice not 
to be bothered. Yeah. I say this, it may sound like

09:46.960 --> 09:50.224
boasting, but it isn't really.

09:53.328 --> 10:01.558
In the presence of other people, D.W. Williams 
said several times, the best thing that I ever did

09:53.328 --> 10:01.558
was leave Al alone. Had he left the others alone? 
No. He had not? One reason was he didn't know a damn

10:06.624 --> 10:09.087
thing about Forrester. And he wasn't much 
interested in learning. He didn't much care. He's

10:12.474 --> 10:14.816
an agriculturalist. He's what? He was an 
agriculturalist. Well, he was more of a stock man.

10:19.501 --> 10:21.482
Well, still, that's agriculture. Yeah. And I'm 
not sure agriculture has any real understanding

10:22.703 --> 10:25.606
of forestry. No, it doesn't. You know, Dean 
Shepardson, when he was here, he didn't want to

10:26.827 --> 10:32.852
have a darn thing to do with forestry. That's good 
and bad. Well, it is bad because had he created a

10:39.847 --> 10:49.681
Department of Forestry here in the College of 
Agriculture, we wouldn't be in the situation we

10:39.847 --> 10:49.681
are today where the Forest Science Department is 
just sort of limping along. It's just sort of

10:49.701 --> 10:51.023
tolerated. Because had that department been set 
up here, the one over at Stephen F. Austin would not

10:51.444 --> 11:00.918
have been established. And I attribute that all to 
Charlie Shepardson's indifference. It's

11:06.906 --> 11:07.407
amazing. EJ Kyle promised the legislature that if 
we got a state forester, we'd have a department of

11:09.074 --> 11:16.501
forestry. Well, that was never created. And he 
never did it. Did you help create the one hand? No.

11:21.805 --> 11:22.826
You didn't have anything to do with it? I more or 
less dragged my feet on it. Yes, I said I thought it

11:25.468 --> 11:27.670
would be a good idea. And I dragged my feet on it 
because I had a divided opinion on it. In the first

11:32.935 --> 11:35.017
place, this is where it belonged. In the second 
place... there was this department in existence

11:38.082 --> 11:43.669
over at Stephen F. Austin. It had a running start. 
Furthermore, it was over there in a forestry

11:45.452 --> 11:48.997
environment. And they still get that flack here 
from students. Well, since we can't take any field

11:52.221 --> 12:02.014
trips and we don't have to pay for it to get over into 
the forestry area, well, we're sort of marooned

11:52.221 --> 12:02.014
here.

12:06.432 --> 12:09.656
Yeah, I just wondered if you had anything to do with 
the creation of that thing. No, I didn't. I

12:11.018 --> 12:21.813
remember this matter was discussed on occasion 
within the group that D.W. Williams would

12:11.018 --> 12:21.813
sometimes get together. When you left, did you 
have any input into who your successor would be?

12:29.343 --> 12:30.885
Well, I'll put it this way. I made a couple of 
recommendations. Okay. But I... Yes, I had some

12:35.373 --> 12:36.794
input. But you were not allowed to hand-pick your 
six-pack? No, no, no, no. Was Siki allowed to

12:41.499 --> 12:43.582
hand-pick white, I wonder? I have no idea. Okay, I 
was just curious about that. Something told me he

12:48.186 --> 12:50.028
could have done that because... I had this feeling 
that the Forest Service, I don't know about now, I

12:51.970 --> 12:59.358
don't know a whole lot about what's going on right 
now, was run so much as an independent agency. It

12:59.618 --> 13:00.820
was, I think. A&M said, that's nice, don't bother 
us, we won't bother you. Of course, they didn't get

13:03.763 --> 13:04.924
any money out of it. A little. Well, not a whole lot, 
but

13:06.649 --> 13:11.896
it's an interesting setup. It's a very 
interesting setup. Now, one more thing you asked

13:15.261 --> 13:16.724
me. What would I like to take credit for while I was 
here? Yeah. Putting some order in it and

13:21.170 --> 13:28.541
initiating this tree improvement work, which has 
a damn good record. And this fellow Zobel that I

13:28.862 --> 13:34.270
brought in here, he has become... WORLD 
AUTHORITY. HE DIDN'T STAY HERE BECAUSE HE

13:36.404 --> 13:43.714
COULDN'T ATTRACT GRADUATE STUDENTS BECAUSE IT 
WASN'T THE FOREST SCIENCE DEPARTMENT. WELL, THE

13:43.734 --> 13:59.616
OTHER THING IS THAT I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING 
IN THIS NURSERY THAT WAS LOCATED WHERE IT WAS

13:43.734 --> 13:59.616
DURING THE PERIOD WHEN The Department of 
Agriculture financed the establishment of

14:00.457 --> 14:13.801
nurseries to reforest land that had been thrown 
out of production because of contraction of

14:00.457 --> 14:13.801
agricultural commodity production. Is this the 
Magnolia? That's right. Later became the

14:17.408 --> 14:23.258
Magnolia Springs.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.669
Yeah, this is a nursery. But this was later 
converted into a seed orchard, Magnolia Springs

14:32.950 --> 14:37.516
Seed Orchard. It's all a big seed orchard now. Who 
was Charlie Heitman? Do you recall? No. Okay. I'm

14:45.646 --> 14:46.568
just curious. I happened to find an extra one of 
those in my files.

14:51.674 --> 14:53.837
I have the chancellor's office files from that 
period. There's just not much in there. I wouldn't

14:55.860 --> 14:56.881
think so. There's not.

15:00.228 --> 15:01.496
I appreciate this interview. You've given me much 
more than I can ever need. Have I given you

15:02.785 --> 15:03.509
everything? Oh, I'll probably think of something 
later, but I can't imagine more than...
