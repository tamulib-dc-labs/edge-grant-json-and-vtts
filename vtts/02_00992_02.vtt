WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:05.129
We're continuing on with college. Okay. Every 
time they would organize some kind of a protest, I

00:05.850 --> 00:09.914
would wear my uniform.

00:12.677 --> 00:27.574
I got in with the small veterans club they had on 
campus, and they voted to allow me to go in to join

00:12.677 --> 00:27.574
the club, even though I was not out of the service, 
and I was an officer. They had two strikes against

00:27.594 --> 00:33.160
me, but they allowed me to go ahead and join. On one 
particular occasion the students were going to

00:33.325 --> 00:43.180
take down the flag in front of the administration 
building.

00:43.200 --> 00:53.395
So we got ourselves organized and we made a roster 
of who had which classes at which times and we

00:43.200 --> 00:53.395
posted guards on the flag all day long and the flag 
didn't come down. We had lots of debates in the

00:55.338 --> 01:02.809
student union and I'm not sure I convinced anybody 
of my way of thinking I'm not sure they convinced

01:03.228 --> 01:14.540
me, but it was active

01:03.228 --> 01:14.540
in terms of participation on both sides. I was the 
only active duty army person on the whole campus.

01:25.011 --> 01:28.375
At the end of two years I knew about half of them and 
they all knew me.

01:32.793 --> 01:38.079
Did you get into any real major blows, not 
physically, but verbal blows? Oh, yes. I was

01:39.260 --> 01:45.788
called, you know, a baby murderer to, you know, 
anything that was going along. And you got a lot of

01:45.828 --> 01:53.616
that wash over and debate them at whatever level 
you felt best at. The only time I ever really lost, I

01:54.517 --> 02:01.365
was invited to come into one of the It

02:02.442 --> 02:08.030
was in the history department. A guy by the name of 
Joe Carter, whom I had known for many years, was one

02:08.050 --> 02:15.401
of the professors.

02:15.421 --> 02:22.632
Asked me if I would come in and be a guest speaker 
since Vietnam seemed to be a topic of greatest

02:15.421 --> 02:22.632
interest with all of the students. And I could 
pretty well hold my own in a debate with any of the

02:23.593 --> 02:28.180
undergraduates. But when I walked into this 
classroom, I found that not only do we have all of

02:29.020 --> 02:42.720
the undergraduates, we've got all of the graduate 
students and all of the faculty in this room.

02:42.740 --> 02:47.067
Well, I did all right until I ended up taking on the 
head of the history department. And I lost that

02:49.190 --> 02:50.572
one. Regardless of what I said, the dean of the 
history department carried more weight than

02:58.282 --> 03:01.166
Undergraduate, Lee Johnson.

03:11.542 --> 03:14.627
You later went on to teach ROTC at Nevada 
University? Mm-hmm. After I finished up my degree

03:16.009 --> 03:26.685
at Adams State, I went to Benning for 10 months, 
finished a infantry officer's advance course.

03:26.851 --> 03:33.156
and then got an assignment out to the University of 
Nevada, Reno as an ROTC instructor. We had five

03:33.176 --> 03:35.178
guys there.

03:41.003 --> 03:43.185
Reno was a unique campus. It was liberal in its 
ideas to some degree and its proximity to

03:44.246 --> 03:56.436
California, and yet it was far enough away from 
Berkeley that we didn't have the violent

03:44.246 --> 03:56.436
protesting. We had a fairly active ROTC 
department.

04:05.723 --> 04:15.353
It was a land grant college, and every able-bodied 
male freshman was required to take one semester of

04:05.723 --> 04:15.353
ROTC. We did not put these in uniform. This was 
strictly academic. Here's what the Army's all, or

04:20.398 --> 04:22.700
the military's all about. We taught Army, Navy, 
Air Force, Although

04:28.225 --> 04:39.578
there was no Army, I mean Navy or Air Force ROTC 
detachment, they were just Army, but because we

04:28.225 --> 04:39.578
were the only one there we taught cross service.

04:42.621 --> 04:53.493
If they elected to come in and take ROTC after that, 
then we would put them in uniform and they had to

04:42.621 --> 04:53.493
make drills and all that, but for the freshmen we 
didn't do all that. It was a trying and a rewarding

04:54.334 --> 04:58.198
experience. The kids were the right age. They had 
cut the relical cord from their parents, and yet

05:01.603 --> 05:08.591
they were still hungry for some kind of adult 
guidance. They were moldable,

05:08.611 --> 05:26.093
enthusiastic,

05:08.611 --> 05:26.093
questioning, and bright, and they would suck as 
much of your time as you would absolutely give

05:08.611 --> 05:26.093
them.

05:27.592 --> 05:30.276
many of the kids I graduated from there I later 
served with. It was probably one of the best three

05:31.558 --> 05:45.178
years I ever spent in terms of

05:31.558 --> 05:45.178
being able to leave your stamp on the service.

05:52.228 --> 05:56.755
You have

05:52.228 --> 05:56.755
anything you'd like to expound on or in what regard 
just overall your whole period how has it affected

05:57.663 --> 06:26.742
your life how have you continued if you had to cope 
with it see I after my second tour I had nightmares

05:57.663 --> 06:26.742
for a little while over that one particular 
incident that we discussed earlier and finally

05:57.663 --> 06:26.742
one day I got out a bunch of maps and I went over the 
whole scenario and decided that Given the

06:28.342 --> 06:32.829
information I had at the time, I would have done 
everything exactly the same. And after that, I

06:33.630 --> 06:39.358
didn't have any problems dealing with it.

06:39.378 --> 06:46.429
Understand that by this time I, well, by the time I 
finished up my second tour, I decided I was going to

06:39.378 --> 06:46.429
be a career officer.

06:49.654 --> 06:51.296
I was very good at what I was doing. I liked leading 
troops. And I did it well. I don't think any other

06:57.417 --> 07:01.863
single person could have done it with any less 
casualties than I did.

07:05.147 --> 07:14.018
And I still had no qualms about being in Vietnam in 
terms of fighting at war other than the fact that I

07:05.147 --> 07:14.018
think we could have won if they had turned us loose. 
Or if they decided it was not winnable, then we

07:14.739 --> 07:17.642
shouldn't have gotten in there. And I can't blame 
that on the troops or the country. While I was at

07:22.448 --> 07:25.332
UNR, Vietnam fell. And there was a graduate 
student there who was Vietnamese, whom everybody

07:29.817 --> 07:36.447
loved. And when the country fell, he was cut off. He 
had no place to go. His family was still back in

07:42.395 --> 07:44.859
Vietnam and all that. And everybody felt very 
sorry for him, except me.

07:50.727 --> 07:52.509
And nobody could understand that. And I said, 
look, For eight years this kid has been in the

07:54.742 --> 07:58.928
United States going to college. Well, I have spent 
more time in the last eight years in his country

08:01.032 --> 08:05.799
than he has. If he was so worried about Vietnam, he 
should have been over there packing a rifle, not

08:07.061 --> 08:13.611
over here hiding and going to college.

08:23.598 --> 08:26.302
I have no desire to ever go back and see Vietnam 
again.

08:29.427 --> 08:30.749
And it was a beautiful country. We messed it up a 
lot.

08:37.660 --> 08:44.210
By the time we got through with that country, you 
could not go half a mile in any direction without

08:37.660 --> 08:44.210
seeing a very big hole in the ground left by a bomb 
somewhere.

08:47.996 --> 08:52.002
Sure, eventually the bomb craters had fell down 
and they rebuilt part of the country, At one time,

08:53.180 --> 08:55.043
Wayne was a beautiful city.

08:57.987 --> 09:03.776
And by the time the NBA and us got through with it, it 
was mostly rubble. But I remember seeing Europe

09:05.479 --> 09:11.668
when I was over there as a dependent in 1948. And

09:11.768 --> 09:19.440
now you can't see any or very few scars of the war 
left in Europe.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.316
I'd like to ask you a question. What do you know 
about the Mealy incident? I knew Rusty Cowley a

09:34.381 --> 09:38.144
little bit from the ranger department. He and I 
were both in the ranger department at Fort Benning

09:38.344 --> 09:57.662
when most of the major investigations in the 
states were created

09:38.344 --> 09:57.662
and he was assigned over to building four at Fort 
Benning which is a big administration building

09:38.344 --> 09:57.662
where he spent most of his time preparing his 
defense with his lawyer. I was at Fort Bedding

10:01.643 --> 10:18.261
where the My Lai court-martial was taking place 
and was there all the time while he was basically

10:01.643 --> 10:18.261
under house arrest after the court-martial 
waiting for the appeal process to take place.

10:21.244 --> 10:23.346
I'm convinced of a number of things. Number one, 
Rusty Calley was guilty of sin. He was tried by a

10:26.524 --> 10:37.460
board of officers who had all been to Vietnam, who 
all understood the problems of command, who

10:26.524 --> 10:37.460
understood the problems of Vietnam, and they 
found him guilty.

10:42.227 --> 10:48.096
The problem with Calley and the My Lai is more basic 
than an individual. He was an OCS product. He was 20

10:51.521 --> 10:53.704
years old when the incident occurred. He had not a 
degree nor very much military background. He was

10:59.990 --> 11:12.986
in a unit that had been put together from a lot of 
different units into a division, so there was not

10:59.990 --> 11:12.986
the real history of a unit. It had a lot of growing 
pains. They were also in an area that was primarily

11:14.628 --> 11:19.894
a pacification program, so they didn't have 
clear-cut enemy as much as they would go into what

11:20.397 --> 11:50.185
was supposedly a friendly village and they would 
take some horrendous losses when they finally get

11:20.397 --> 11:50.185
into the village there wouldn't be anybody there 
everybody would say oh they were friendly and you

11:20.397 --> 11:50.185
had men women and children

11:20.397 --> 11:50.185
the repetition of this over a long time caused a 
great deal of frustration and I think not only

11:20.397 --> 11:50.185
amongst the leaders by amongst the troops. I 
basically think that he just kind of went berserk

11:55.715 --> 11:58.718
one day. What he did was absolutely wrong. In any 
military conflict, there's going to be civilians

12:03.822 --> 12:11.810
that get hurt. My standing orders to my troops used 
to be whenever we had to deal with a civilian

12:14.192 --> 12:19.817
populace, which was not very often, If you see 
somebody running after you've told them to stand

12:22.210 --> 12:32.060
still, and we had Vietnamese interpreters and 
loudspeakers to do that, you shoot.

12:34.863 --> 12:40.068
The troops, when they go into a village, don't have 
time to ask questions. They don't have time to look

12:40.168 --> 12:48.436
real hard to see whether it's a guy's got a weapon or 
it's a 17-year-old kid or it's a 13-year-old kid.

12:48.456 --> 12:50.158
You can't tell the difference when they're 
moving. And it's very much like a policeman. He

12:54.039 --> 13:00.567
walks outside of a bank, and he knows the bank's 
being robbed, and he sees somebody run out the door

12:54.039 --> 13:00.567
real quick, and he yells to him to halt, and he 
doesn't halt. The policeman will probably shoot.

13:05.012 --> 13:10.018
But if the guy stops, and he lines him up against the 
wall, and then shoots him, that's murder.

13:11.639 --> 13:13.181
Basically, that's what Kelly did. He said after 
they had captured these people, they shot them.

13:19.168 --> 13:19.909
And a bunch of them.

13:22.977 --> 13:32.049
The primary reason for having officers is to 
ensure that units operate within the realm of law.

13:33.451 --> 13:42.123
Small units like platoons can operate probably as 
well under an NCO as they can under a platoon leader

13:33.451 --> 13:42.123
or a platoon commander. But that is the training 
ground for higher ranking officers. and is to

13:48.998 --> 13:53.022
ensure that units operate within the scope of the 
law. Cali had neither the training nor the

13:55.664 --> 14:04.292
maturity nor the experience to carry that 
through.

14:07.355 --> 14:09.196
You feel that reflected on the Army Officer Corps? 
Most definitely.

14:16.703 --> 14:18.685
Cali was probably not the only one

14:22.293 --> 14:27.998
Our officer corps expanded tremendously in a 
period of a few years. I was responsible for

14:29.640 --> 14:34.564
producing some of those lieutenants. I ran an OCS 
company on a number of occasions. I tried to bounce

14:38.408 --> 14:43.012
out people whom I thought would not be good 
officers. And as an OCS company commander, I

14:44.894 --> 14:50.359
submitted reports to an evaluation board that 
generally consisted of a lieutenant colonel, two

14:52.111 --> 14:58.601
majors, and a couple of captains.

15:01.705 --> 15:12.481
They had to make an evaluation based on my reports 
and their interview with the prospective

15:01.705 --> 15:12.481
lieutenant of whether or not he would or would not 
remain in the program. Many times, my evaluation

15:14.745 --> 15:19.131
and recommendation was overruled. And one day I 
finally got mad and walked into the board and

15:21.237 --> 15:29.267
talked to the president of the board about, I would 
not have this character as one of my platoon

15:21.237 --> 15:29.267
leaders. And he said, I understand what you're 
saying, Captain Johnson, but in many cases a

15:30.729 --> 15:40.642
lieutenant is better than no lieutenant. And I 
said, yeah, but I would rather have a sergeant

15:40.662 --> 15:42.904
running it. He said, yeah, but we don't have 
sergeants either. I talked to you earlier about

15:47.090 --> 15:50.434
the NCO academy. that our army had expanded so fast 
in such a short period of time that we had neither

15:50.650 --> 16:19.712
good qualified officers or ncos that understood 
and it doesn't come from reading a book but from the

15:50.650 --> 16:19.712
deep tradition bound understanding that comes 
with being a part of a unit and watching and

15:50.650 --> 16:19.712
observing superiors

16:20.350 --> 16:36.067
that kind of understanding comes from.

16:36.087 --> 16:37.328
I remember digging out all those letters. He wrote 
me every day. Were you ever accused or had any

16:42.294 --> 16:46.999
experience with other war atrocities that took 
place?

16:49.949 --> 16:59.463
I, well I was in the advanced course, one of the 
young E-5s that had been in my company during my

16:49.949 --> 16:59.463
tenure. And understand that when I took over my 
company,

16:59.483 --> 17:09.438
in the six month period before me, they had five 
company commanders. All of them had been shot out

17:10.640 --> 17:13.304
from under the company. The company that I was in 
was involved in a way during the test. and they had

17:19.497 --> 17:23.202
two company commanders in less than three weeks.

17:26.908 --> 17:37.884
One of these characters got out and joined the 
Vietnam Veterans Against the War and had made a

17:26.908 --> 17:37.884
number of allegations about the company 
commanders that he had served under. I got called

17:37.904 --> 17:48.660
out of the advance course and reported out of the 
Provo Marshal's office to be interviewed, and the

17:37.904 --> 17:48.660
list of allegations ran from murder to petty 
theft. After submitting my affidavit and

17:50.260 --> 17:56.870
answering all the questions on tape, charges were 
later dropped. It wasn't really a charge at this

17:59.153 --> 18:00.855
point in time. They were doing what they call an 
Article 32 investigation. There's a civilian

18:04.601 --> 18:06.864
name for it. I can't remember what it is, but 
basically it is a preliminary investigation to

18:06.944 --> 18:19.002
determine whether or not there is a basis for 
initiating court martial proceedings.

18:20.703 --> 18:26.992
The investigation later resulted in them 
dropping all the charges because they found out

18:20.703 --> 18:26.992
that this kid was basically just trying to raise 
dust. But it was enough to strike terror in my heart

18:28.854 --> 18:40.871
because at that point in time, in 1970, merely 
being accused was enough to ruin one's career. How

18:43.034 --> 18:48.101
did you control your troops when they do get angry 
from having their buddies blown away? How do you

18:48.642 --> 18:49.663
control them from committing such atrocity? By 
example and by letting them know absolutely that

18:51.707 --> 18:58.118
nothing will happen. On one occasion, I think I 
mentioned to you when the tape was off, we had, we

18:59.380 --> 19:09.076
were moving through an area where we had killed a 
lot of people.

19:11.861 --> 19:15.567
We had used artillery as well as mortars and I came 
across, I usually ran my company command group

19:17.504 --> 19:30.197
right behind the first platoon and then I would 
have two platoons either out on the flank or behind

19:17.504 --> 19:30.197
me and the mortar platoon behind me. And somebody 
had taken a bamboo stake or just a piece of bamboo

19:31.799 --> 19:47.055
and had chopped it off with a machete and taken a 
head of an NVA soldier that had been severed with

19:31.799 --> 19:47.055
what looked like artillery but some kind of a 
fragment and had shoved it down on top of this

19:47.575 --> 19:51.281
bamboo stake and put a first calf patch in the 
mouth. Well the NVA were predominantly Buddhist

19:53.885 --> 20:15.979
and the Buddhists were very superstitious or what 
we consider to be superstition in that if their

19:53.885 --> 20:15.979
body wasn't whole or at least together I mean all 
the parts of it in the burial place that they

19:53.885 --> 20:15.979
couldn't go to heaven and that used to really

20:20.178 --> 20:22.241
caused serious morale problems with the NVA. And 
it became common for many troops to leave either

20:23.603 --> 20:36.240
human patches or an ace of spades or something on 
the bodies as a calling card for the guys that came

20:23.603 --> 20:36.240
in and picked up the bodies later. And it was a 
psychological game. I simply got my lieutenants

20:40.766 --> 20:43.109
to put out the word. I didn't want to know who did 
that, but I didn't want to ever see it again, and it

20:43.129 --> 20:47.755
never happened. As long as the river is in command, 
we'll put out the word that what is acceptable as

20:48.798 --> 20:59.198
norms, the troops will fall in line with that. And 
occasionally if somebody gets out a little bit,

21:00.099 --> 21:05.770
you bring it back into the fold.

21:09.778 --> 21:09.878
Okay. Do you have anything else you want to add on 
this topic?

21:18.093 --> 21:21.623
I think every every time

21:27.053 --> 21:31.820
This has been an interview with retired Army 
Lieutenant Colonel Lee Leonard C. Johnson. His

21:32.281 --> 21:37.829
awards consist of one Silver Star, seven Bronze 
Stars, Air Medal, two Purple Hearts. He served the

21:38.330 --> 21:42.116
Army from March 1963 to April 1984. He served two 
tours in Vietnam from July 1966 to July 1967 and

21:42.216 --> 21:51.430
August of 1968 to August 1969. He presently 
resides in Temple, Texas with his wife and two

21:52.492 --> 21:55.997
children.
