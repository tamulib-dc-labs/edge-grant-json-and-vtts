WEBVTT

00:03.760 --> 00:05.122
All right. You mentioned win the hearts and minds. 
Now, that was an official policy or strategy for

00:07.666 --> 00:12.254
you, wasn't it? It was. Okay. Was it taken 
seriously? And if so, how did you do it? We would,

00:21.048 --> 00:30.122
for example, we would go into a village and we would 
surround it with our infantry troops. and to

00:30.845 --> 00:33.768
prevent the B.C. from, or the North Sea B.C. from 
sneaking up and ambushing. And then we would set up

00:38.893 --> 00:49.663
a medical dental unit inside the village, and we 
would do dental work and medical work for the

00:38.893 --> 00:49.663
villagers. And, you know, those things were 
really effective. On the other hand, when the B.C.

00:55.128 --> 00:57.831
would come back in, if someone had a gold tooth, for 
example, or other evidence that they

00:58.148 --> 01:02.775
collaborated with the Americans Then they would, 
you know, there were reports of them being

01:03.059 --> 01:17.752
executed, being tortured, harassed, taken to 
relocation, you know, relocated elsewhere,

01:03.059 --> 01:17.752
those kind of things. And, you know, once the 
Vietnamese perceived that we were not going to be

01:18.393 --> 01:33.066
able to protect them, that we had been in there a 
long time, and that our strategy of counting the

01:18.393 --> 01:33.066
numbers of bodies that we killed wasn't going to 
protect them in the long run, they started to think

01:33.046 --> 01:42.035
about their own survival more than any other 
thing. Okay. Continuing with the relationship

01:42.175 --> 02:00.673
with the Vietnamese, there was a lot of talk about 
the U.S. Army beating stones, and probably an

01:42.175 --> 02:00.673
over-exaggeration, but to what extent was the use 
of narcotics, of whatever substance, especially

01:42.175 --> 02:00.673
related to your platoon and from what you saw? I, 
when I was,

02:01.345 --> 02:21.303
my first

02:01.345 --> 02:21.303
assignment

02:01.345 --> 02:21.303
with Charlie Company, when I left as the acting 
platoon leader, I was reassigned to the mouth of

02:01.345 --> 02:21.303
35M. When I left the field to go to the defensive 
perimeter, i expected and uh would

02:22.760 --> 02:44.228
uh would would hear and overhear people talking 
about it but they never took me into their

02:22.760 --> 02:44.228
confidence i just wanted to get into their 
confidence that uh and i could tell that some

02:22.760 --> 02:44.228
people were acting a little weirdly and uh i never 
On one occasion, we were leaving for an ambush, and

02:45.001 --> 03:04.522
as I was checking the people off, my people off, at 
that time I had about, I was taking a couple of

02:45.001 --> 03:04.522
supplies, so I probably had about 17 people. One of 
my men who was a RTO, the radio carrier, didn't have

03:04.722 --> 03:08.726
a weapon. And I said, wait a minute, where's your 
weapon? And he said, I said, if something happens,

03:15.477 --> 03:22.227
There'll be plenty of weapons. I'll use somebody 
else's weapons. And I said, whoa, hold it right

03:23.969 --> 03:25.211
there. Middle outer police guy said, hold it right 
there. Just get back and get a weapon. You're not

03:31.140 --> 03:32.742
going anywhere without a weapon. This isn't, you 
know, come dressed as you are. You know, everybody

03:34.284 --> 03:39.852
had to have a certain amount of, you know, had to 
have a weapon and so many magazines and so many

03:34.284 --> 03:39.852
grenades and signals. You had to carry, you know, 
what you thought you needed. And, uh, so at that

03:43.439 --> 03:57.463
level, uh, I, in our unit, it wasn't, uh, I

03:43.439 --> 03:57.463
wasn't aware of it being all that pervasive. But, 
uh, it's, uh, probably, uh, and I'm thinking of, of

03:57.483 --> 04:01.430
marijuana. Well, can I, how does that tie in with 
the, um, radio operator? Well, I suspect that he

04:04.375 --> 04:06.679
probably had been, uh, doing some marijuana 
earlier. At the time, I didn't think all that much

04:07.064 --> 04:16.114
about it. I just thought it was kind of his somewhat 
absent-minded nature. But then later on, we were

04:22.321 --> 04:27.147
ambushed, and he lost an eye. And when I got out of my 
section of the hospital, I visited him, and he had

04:27.167 --> 04:33.274
said that that he was going to

04:33.710 --> 04:41.582
stop using someone's dope. And I assume that he'd 
been using dope, and I was pretty much unaware of

04:42.623 --> 04:51.276
it. Do you know where the marijuana was bought? Was 
it everywhere? It was everywhere. Every

04:56.524 --> 05:02.974
five-year-old kid who sold coke could either sell 
you or put you in contact with someone who had you

04:56.524 --> 05:02.974
buy anything you wanted. I really

05:04.051 --> 05:32.151
don't know what the Vietnamese attitude towards 
prostitution was prior to us being, you know,

05:04.051 --> 05:32.151
prior to the French being,

05:04.051 --> 05:32.151
or maybe the Japanese in 39, but It was a pretty grim 
survival over there, and I think that being a

05:33.160 --> 05:49.656
prostitute had a certain amount of acceptance in 
the way of supporting a family.

05:49.676 --> 05:59.725
So, indirectly, do you think maybe the prevalent 
prostitution and the narcotics, would this maybe

05:49.676 --> 05:59.725
have been a... and, let's say, a positive effect in 
the WAM, would that have won some hearts and minds?

06:05.851 --> 06:10.536
Or maybe just as long as the bucks were flowing, 
they were smiling. Do you know what I'm getting at

06:11.917 --> 06:13.119
there? Yeah, well, if you're getting at who was in 
involvement with the American G.I. to a certain

06:20.427 --> 06:22.489
segment of society, Yeah, that element of society 
probably

06:23.228 --> 06:32.300
has to be the general, venerable deal that needs to 
be presented. Okay. Well, how about any...

06:36.565 --> 06:53.067
There's been a lot of, well, let's say, with the 
tale of brutality on the ground and the mass

06:36.565 --> 06:53.067
long-distance and sometimes indiscriminate 
death from the sky, a lot of people claim that this

06:36.565 --> 06:53.067
was easily done and done because of the racist view 
towards the gook. In fact, that was pretty common

06:53.401 --> 07:00.131
to call the Arvins gooks, and that is a derogatory 
term. Do you agree that perhaps the whole culture,

07:00.151 --> 07:04.717
the whole people, they were looked down on? 
Absolutely. When we began the war, even through

07:08.462 --> 07:22.362
basic training and the different levels of 
training that the average American GI went

07:08.462 --> 07:22.362
through to get to Vietnam, they were referred to as 
derogatory and racist terms. And, uh, your, uh,

07:22.645 --> 07:33.946
you know, I want to get to Vietnam, we killed some 
Charlie Klong. Your airborne, uh, running song,

07:33.966 --> 07:37.432
uh, they were, they were something very, uh, 
racist. And I guess there's a surveillance then in

07:37.452 --> 07:41.520
your platoon also, right? Uh, it, it's, uh, It was a

07:46.810 --> 08:03.073
matter of survival

07:46.810 --> 08:03.073
at that point. And even though there was a 
realization

08:03.094 --> 08:13.268
that they're just like us, only on the other side, 
and those who aren't on the other side are in the

08:03.094 --> 08:13.268
middle, the majority of citizens, it's a matter of 
survival. And I can only keep to my own right now

08:13.288 --> 08:15.231
because if I keep to somebody else's, then it'll 
kill me. Well, then would you agree that there was

08:16.493 --> 08:21.419
an underlying racist attitude? Really, no matter 
what was done to win the hearts and minds, it

08:22.200 --> 08:33.452
probably wasn't done with, well, with the amount 
of enthusiasm. I would completely agree. I would

08:36.116 --> 08:41.742
say that from our military strategy to the 
attitude that the average troop represented to

08:36.116 --> 08:41.742
the average human being, It

08:42.194 --> 08:53.223
was a numbered game and there was no quality. And 
the attitude was a very erratic attitude. After

08:54.648 --> 09:10.454
the My Life publicity in 1968, many people argued 
or defended the incident by claiming the often

08:54.648 --> 09:10.454
heard grenade-rigged baby tactics employed by 
the VC and NBN. Is there a certain amount of truth to

09:10.874 --> 09:12.397
that? I think there's a great deal of truth to that. 
I'm not defending the incident, but I'm saying

09:16.518 --> 09:30.932
that I know that after an extended period of 
combat... A little louder please. I know that

09:30.952 --> 09:41.563
after an extended period of contact with hostile 
fire and friendly casualties occurring with

09:30.952 --> 09:41.563
people around you being blown to bits, being sent 
or killed for life, and

09:41.864 --> 10:07.382
smiling faces turning and wheeling on you with

09:41.864 --> 10:07.382
automatic weapons, that your ability to discern 
between right and wrong and how to act really

09:41.864 --> 10:07.382
changes. And it probably changes in most 
everything. And you just become a little more

10:08.283 --> 10:11.027
violent and flash out. You

10:11.767 --> 10:37.019
see,

10:11.767 --> 10:37.019
in your mind at

10:11.767 --> 10:37.019
the time, if you can eradicate these people right 
now that are affluent, you're not going to have the

10:11.767 --> 10:37.019
problem to live. If you can't, you may not. And if 
you're in a situation where your powers are

10:37.700 --> 10:40.624
feeling that way and thinking that way, it's hard 
to, it just doesn't turn off right away. And some

10:40.644 --> 10:41.385
people are very poor judges. Well, yeah, war is 
war, as some say, right? Yes. And that's not a

10:45.877 --> 10:48.761
justification, though. Um, okay, well, I'd like 
to, I guess, hit the last thing before we call this

10:49.563 --> 10:57.714
off, and this is just pretty much your home front 
experience after the war. And I'm curious, when

10:57.734 --> 11:03.423
you, okay, you returned, could you repeat again, 
when did you return? I returned on July 10th, 1970.

11:06.427 --> 11:06.527
Okay. And, uh, that week, that was... That was 
just... We had gone to Cambodia in, I believe,

11:11.133 --> 11:18.225
March. March, April, March, yeah. April, March, 
April of 1970. And... How were you received back

11:24.877 --> 11:26.880
home? Well, by... I felt very disappointed 
because when I came into Oakland, and while I was

11:30.860 --> 11:46.616
still, before I got to the airport, I'd been 
insulted by, and it's called baby killer. I'm

11:46.636 --> 11:47.177
sorry. A what? A baby killer. by a long-haired

11:49.169 --> 12:10.381
hippie, who,

11:49.169 --> 12:10.381
you know, obviously had, I don't even know if he was 
old enough, his girlfriend was old enough to be

11:49.169 --> 12:10.381
concerned about the war, or the draft war. And I 
just think I deserve that, and that just didn't

12:10.401 --> 12:14.367
make me feel very good, because I felt like I'd been 
lucky to escape with my life, and... That's funny

12:16.928 --> 12:22.476
that you say that, because I've already alluded to 
him in his book, Rumor of War. Philip Caputo wrote,

12:22.496 --> 12:29.586
and he was on his way returning back home, that, 
quote, we had done nothing more than endure. We had

12:30.086 --> 12:34.232
survived, and that was our only victory. Would you 
add to that, or does that pretty

12:34.312 --> 12:39.880
much say it? Well, I think that pretty much says it. 
All I could add to that would be to say that I think a

12:42.183 --> 12:45.147
lot of us got home We regrouped our thoughts about 
what we were doing there. And a great number of us,

12:59.199 --> 13:07.470
either we do it or we get off the pot. Either we go in 
there and eradicate a great number of agents, or

13:07.490 --> 13:12.777
else we get out of there, because we are not going to 
win the war the way it's going. And I think it forced

13:12.797 --> 13:15.420
a lot of us into political situations that we 
otherwise probably wouldn't have involved. and

13:15.755 --> 13:21.522
has altered the course of our lives. Why do you 
think there's still so many vets who are angry,

13:21.842 --> 13:35.398
unbalanced, and, well, in jail, just not getting 
over it? Or is there maybe an insight to that that

13:35.418 --> 13:41.845
you could give? I think they feel like they 
personally have been drained of a number of years

13:41.865 --> 13:45.289
of their life have

13:45.472 --> 14:08.526
been

13:45.472 --> 14:08.526
gently experienced in Vietnam, and society has 
not responded to them in general, has not welcomed

13:45.472 --> 14:08.526
them back as people who gave everything they could 
for their life, and it just hasn't been too kind to

13:45.472 --> 14:08.526
the Vietnam veterans. He doesn't recognize the 
Vietnam vetter for a number of years. If you were a

14:23.126 --> 14:30.116
Vietnam vet, you would have drug-crazed Vietnam 
vets. And I don't think the society has ever said,

14:30.136 --> 14:34.443
you know, you people really did a hard job. You 
really did. You know, you've been kicked in the

14:34.783 --> 14:37.667
butt by the enemy, and now you've spent a number of 
years spat upon by your fellow countrymen. And you

14:37.687 --> 14:38.108
deserve that. Okay. I guess with the last 
question, it ties in with my first one, and that was

14:40.438 --> 14:46.966
of a subjective nature. I asked you earlier, prior 
to NOM, what your feelings were. And,

14:51.192 --> 15:03.488
let's see, you stated your feelings, and how did 
they change once you're back in, or if they had at

14:51.192 --> 15:03.488
all, what were your feelings right after, let's 
say, a few months in the U.S.? Okay.

15:07.357 --> 15:27.077
I went over there thinking that we were doing

15:07.357 --> 15:27.077
the right

15:07.357 --> 15:27.077
thing, that we were a good country, we were doing 
the right thing. Once I realized that, though,

15:27.097 --> 15:31.602
entirely, we were not doing everything that we 
could, that the average GI was a little more than

15:27.097 --> 15:31.602
space for five houses, and that the BSC people just 
didn't need to be all that thrilled with us. Uh,

15:32.037 --> 15:43.208
I was, I was disappointed on that count. I came, 
came home, requested on it a while, and I

15:43.228 --> 15:45.715
eventually became, uh, involved with Vietnam 
better than I guess we would. Uh, so, so... I

15:46.718 --> 16:10.301
basically

15:46.718 --> 16:10.301
tried to assert the proposition that we were not 
going to win the war, that the objective that we had

15:46.718 --> 16:10.301
could not win the war, and that we should come to 
some other decision and more openly refuse. I was

16:10.321 --> 16:11.302
fairly active that way. It was a major part of my 
life throughout the following college years.

16:12.743 --> 16:13.924
Then I burned out on involvement, political 
involvement, I, uh,

16:14.680 --> 16:36.247
before I

16:14.680 --> 16:36.247
burned out, I was a human delegate for the EFL 
National Convention in Miami. And, uh, and after

16:36.267 --> 16:39.631
working for some local candidates, uh, I haven't 
done anything political, really, since, uh,

16:36.267 --> 16:39.631
since about four years after returning home. And 
my attitude has evolved from one of the terrible

16:39.651 --> 16:41.093
mistakes and, uh, And

16:41.393 --> 17:07.438
people who

16:41.393 --> 17:07.438
should be

16:41.393 --> 17:07.438
listening

16:41.393 --> 17:07.438
have been ignoring, shoving it under the door, 
trying to point someone else to one of, in the long

16:41.393 --> 17:07.438
run, we may have served our ultimate objective. 
Right now, China is in the process of

17:07.458 --> 17:08.479
capitalizing. It looks through the example that 
Japan has set since World War II, the example that

17:08.499 --> 17:11.282
economic might is inferior to military might. 
They

17:12.494 --> 17:37.807
look to Russia

17:12.494 --> 17:37.807
and probably don't want

17:12.494 --> 17:37.807
the average Chinese citizen to live the life that 
the average Russian citizen lives, and think that

17:12.494 --> 17:37.807
they can accomplish everything they want to by 
economic means. I think that Vietnam would,

17:37.827 --> 17:38.788
Russia and China, It

17:40.962 --> 18:05.849
had

17:40.962 --> 18:05.849
the effect of their

17:40.962 --> 18:05.849
parting ideological

17:40.962 --> 18:05.849
ways, and the Chinese deciding to go elect 
military troops. And I think that our presence in

18:05.869 --> 18:09.653
Vietnam for the number of years, the protracted 
time that we were there, probably helped in the

18:05.869 --> 18:09.653
Chinese leadership at that time, that the 
Americans wouldn't have been where they were for

18:10.055 --> 18:28.516
quite a period of time. They would create enough 
problems that they weren't about to, that they

18:28.536 --> 18:35.343
would draw lines and not allow the Chinese to run 
whole hog over that section of the world. And

18:35.363 --> 18:37.986
enough people in China probably decided that they 
really didn't have to fight for that. And

18:38.708 --> 18:54.844
I'm not sure that without Vietnam, without 
Vietnam, there may have been more Chinese

18:38.708 --> 18:54.844
involvement in the government in Cambodia, 
Vietnam, Thailand, Laos. And

18:56.832 --> 19:17.963
with Vietnam, I think it helps change the course of 
superpowers because China is involved in

18:56.832 --> 19:17.963
capitalizing. Russia has a very limited, I think 
Russia has a limited amount of time, number of

19:17.983 --> 19:19.745
years. They're going to have to gather so many 
South Americans and Africans and third world

19:19.765 --> 19:21.608
nations to

19:22.195 --> 19:43.789
their

19:22.195 --> 19:43.789
form of government before China capitalized, 
because China is going to be the first example to

19:22.195 --> 19:43.789
third world peace. And I think that because of our 
being involved in Vietnam, China decided, China

19:43.810 --> 19:47.275
was prevented from taking any more direct action 
by its more radical, early 1960s government. And

19:47.508 --> 20:00.625
as

19:47.508 --> 20:00.625
a result,

19:47.508 --> 20:00.625
it's evolved into a somewhat more peaceful 
nation. Okay. Well, I would maybe like to

20:00.885 --> 20:13.121
sometimes catch a follow-up interview on this, 
even though it's not dependent on a grade, because

20:00.885 --> 20:13.121
we've touched upon a lot of things, and with some 
detail and then without some detail. So for this

20:13.141 --> 20:14.443
one, thank you very
