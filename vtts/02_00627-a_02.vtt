00:10.493 --> 00:13.837
Now, repeat the last part about New York. You'd 
have... Okay.

00:17.662 --> 00:40.129
There's absolutely no chance of finding oil in 
Long Island Sound or even as much as until 30 or 40

00:17.662 --> 00:40.129
miles seaward of Long Island itself because the 
geology of Long Island Sound area consists of 200

00:17.662 --> 00:40.129
or 300 feet of glacial overburden that overlies 
pre-Cambrian rocks. which there's no oil that's

00:40.261 --> 00:44.507
ever been found pre-Cambrian rock. And the oil 
company in their right mind would think of

00:44.527 --> 00:50.495
drilling a well in Long Island Sound for those 
reasons. And yet the people on the Connecticut and

00:50.515 --> 01:05.957
New York shores and on the North Shore of Long 
Island were quite vehement in saying they don't

00:50.515 --> 01:05.957
want these damn oil rigs in Long Island Sound 
getting in the way of their sailboats or

00:50.515 --> 01:05.957
motorboats or spilling oil all over the place and 
messing things up. And it's totally unrealistic

01:05.977 --> 01:09.762
to expect to find oil in that area. I cite that as an 
example of emotionalism rather than back to

01:09.978 --> 01:15.169
objectivity. Do you foresee more cooperation 
between, let's say, laboratories and schools and

01:16.973 --> 01:30.062
industries now that the

01:16.973 --> 01:30.062
desperation for new fuel sources has appeared?

01:33.485 --> 01:34.226
Oh, I don't know. I think cooperation, 
collaboration between the laboratories and

01:34.286 --> 01:40.152
industry has always been pretty good.

01:43.096 --> 01:48.121
Let's see whether there necessarily should be 
more. I think it will continue on at least at the

01:48.141 --> 01:50.384
same rate. You don't see then, let's say, a 
proliferation of agencies involved in the ocean,

01:52.126 --> 02:02.597
which will mean an ocean-related activity, which 
will mean then... duplication of research and

02:02.965 --> 02:05.648
research interest. Yeah, we've already had that 
proliferation. And these outfits have been

02:07.990 --> 02:16.839
messing all along, like BLM and EPA and the Marine 
branch of the USGS. There are three that are now

02:16.859 --> 02:20.863
getting in the act. We've already had the 
proliferation. I hope to God it doesn't continue.

02:24.347 --> 02:26.689
It would be even worse. You foresee then, let's 
say, a new president's commission appearing.

02:33.104 --> 02:42.096
Yes, as a matter of fact, I only foresee it, but 
Senator Hollings has already been making noises

02:33.104 --> 02:42.096
about setting one up in some of his more recent 
press releases. And I reminded the staff when I saw

02:43.998 --> 02:49.526
that that you should go back and look at the one that 
came out in 1968.

02:52.590 --> 02:57.296
Save the money for a new commission and apply it to 
doing more work in oceanography. The blueprint's

02:58.417 --> 03:00.600
there if you want to follow it. There hasn't been 
that much change basically in sociology or

03:02.247 --> 03:11.743
anything else of economics since then have 
warranted a new approach or a new attack. Do you see

03:11.763 --> 03:16.712
a changing direction in the future of research in 
oceanography? Yeah, I think it's going to be

03:18.312 --> 03:26.723
directed more toward applied research rather 
than basic research, if you don't want to pin me

03:18.312 --> 03:26.723
down with a definition or two. But right now 
there's more money available for oceanographers

03:27.464 --> 03:42.463
to solve problems on the continental shelf and 
estuaries and so on than there is in the deep ocean,

03:27.464 --> 03:42.463
because the people are tired of supporting basic 
research in oceanography the last 20 years or more

03:42.832 --> 03:49.858
and not having anything very definite to show for 
it. And so Congress reacts to the wishes of their

03:49.878 --> 03:54.202
constituents. I think any additional funding 
that's going to come in oceanography in the next

03:54.222 --> 04:12.417
few years will be in projects that are more closely 
tied to solving specific problems that are a

03:54.222 --> 04:12.417
benefit to the congressman's constituents than 
just giving a blank check to go out and do what they

03:54.222 --> 04:12.417
want to. So more applied than pure research? Yeah. 
Emphasis is definitely going in, already started

04:15.730 --> 04:20.396
going in applied research. This million and a half 
dollars I mentioned before, as far as I'm

04:20.656 --> 04:27.025
concerned, strictly 95% of that is applied 
research. Do you see, let's say, more

04:27.045 --> 04:35.496
environmental or impact studies coming forth 
from oceanographers? More of that, but I think

04:35.956 --> 04:40.362
also more getting information that will help 
develop the potential wealth of the ocean.

04:51.665 --> 04:59.111
In the academic world, do you see the breakup of 
oceanography departments once more or more

04:51.665 --> 04:59.111
consolidation towards oceanography 
departments?

05:01.694 --> 05:05.037
That depends on the institution. You can't answer 
that question yes or no like, have you stopped

05:05.057 --> 05:08.880
beating your wife? I think it depends entirely on 
the philosophy of the institution. In most

05:12.302 --> 05:15.465
institutions, I think they're away from a 
breakup. They're trying to incorporate new

05:15.786 --> 05:24.576
divisions, such as I mentioned, where the 
emphasis is on applied oceanography and the

05:15.786 --> 05:24.576
emphasis is on estuaries and shallow water. But in 
this particular university, the emphasis seems

05:25.798 --> 05:37.011
to be about breaking it up by having marine science 
curricula, activities, sea grant, and that sort

05:25.798 --> 05:37.011
of thing. Rather than trying to put it all under the 
umbrella of an oceanography department, they're

05:37.548 --> 05:48.910
trying to put all marine-related activities on 
the campus under a separate umbrella. And this

05:49.411 --> 05:54.480
isn't just A&M, but I think that philosophy is a 
minority rather than a majority. This is an

05:54.500 --> 05:57.025
example of Oregon State. was a department of 
oceanography until a couple of years ago, and is

05:57.342 --> 06:05.474
now a college of oceanography, or school of 
oceanography, rather. University of Rhode

06:05.935 --> 06:09.961
Island is a graduate school of oceanography. 
University of Miami has a school of oceanography

06:10.682 --> 06:16.651
and atmospheric sciences. So the emphasis, with 
only a few exceptions, is on consolidation rather

06:16.671 --> 06:25.003
than fragmentation. I mean, I've been making 
comments about the government fragmenting and

06:25.237 --> 06:34.048
proliferating its oceanographic agencies and 
marine-oriented agencies. I mean, the same

06:34.068 --> 06:35.910
applies to this university.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.136
The last and final question, then. Would you want 
to list people whom you would suggest had a shaking

06:41.176 --> 06:50.367
influence on your career in oceanography and say 
possibly a few words about them? who had to direct

06:52.102 --> 06:55.286
you towards research oceanography. Well, I 
already mentioned earlier, this afternoon,

06:55.587 --> 07:15.054
people like Dr. Hess, who was one of the first 
land-type geophysicists and geologists to go to

06:55.587 --> 07:15.054
sea and get information, George Willard, Maurice 
Ewing, Columbus Islin. I guess those are the main

07:15.074 --> 07:17.097
ones.

07:23.523 --> 07:30.149
Would you offer any explanation why that you were 
attracted to oceanography and working the sea,

07:23.523 --> 07:30.149
let's say, rather than work on the land? Yeah, I 
think I mentioned that in the first few minutes,

07:30.809 --> 07:42.079
that I found out pretty soon working on land that 
the major questions such as continental drift and

07:30.809 --> 07:42.079
things like that couldn't be answered on land. You 
had to get the information from the sea, where it,

07:42.139 --> 07:48.805
again, wasn't buried under thousands of feet of 
sediment. This is for pure science. I mean,

07:51.047 --> 07:53.209
applied science, of course. Again, when the oil 
companies started going into the sea, well, I

07:53.645 --> 07:58.657
followed them along with it. Well, does there seem 
to be to you a general, let's say, description of

07:59.760 --> 08:06.858
the older oceanographers, as people are quickly 
involved in the field? They seem to have an

08:06.898 --> 08:09.865
interest in all sorts of environmental studies. 
We're struck by the interest in the air and the

08:11.819 --> 08:22.376
ocean, for example, by Spilhaus, and the interest 
in continental drift and fields of magnetism and

08:11.819 --> 08:22.376
the ocean and you and other people. Does it seem to 
be that oceanography and early environmentalist

08:22.557 --> 08:27.625
movements seem to work hand in hand? Well, by 
environment you mean, well, it carries two

08:29.448 --> 08:34.857
connotations.

08:37.250 --> 08:41.658
You talk about an atmospheric, a land, and a marine 
environment. You know those three things. OK.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.807
Rather than environment in the sense of an 
environmental impact statement. Right. OK. I'll

08:48.049 --> 08:52.837
go along with that if you take it in the former 
rather than the latter. And I think of the people I

08:54.140 --> 08:57.165
mentioned, including myself, tend to be more 
generalists rather than specialists. Now, this

09:00.825 --> 09:02.792
is the point being interdisciplinary. This is the 
point we were leading up to, and we just didn't know

09:02.953 --> 09:07.510
how to ask you the question to get you to say it 
rather than us.
