WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:04.366
was more sort of a close-knit fraternity. There 
weren't a whole lot of you guys, by the way, you

00:04.386 --> 00:06.608
know. No. That you had a chance probably to know 
everyone and much more camaraderie existed. Do

00:12.234 --> 00:21.122
you feel as you got towards the end of your career 
that somehow or another that oceanography became

00:12.234 --> 00:21.122
more specialized and more impersonal? Well, it 
became

00:23.444 --> 00:31.472
in one way more specialized and more fragmented 
And then the sheer bulk of people that were

00:31.975 --> 00:46.736
involved necessarily meant less intimate 
associations with the few that were in the field in

00:31.975 --> 00:46.736
the early days. And in the early days, much of the 
contacts would actually be some Europeans. And

00:56.029 --> 01:01.577
Helen Hansen was through here early on. at Grand, 
and a number of people in the early days. And before

01:09.150 --> 01:19.064
Tommy Thompson built the laboratory, that's why 
he toured Europe to get an idea of what was going on

01:09.150 --> 01:19.064
in Europe. And of course, he, being a true 
extrovert, knew people all over

01:19.164 --> 01:30.079
the world. In your opinion, and sort of this 
particularly working in the north, which, you

01:30.700 --> 01:44.739
know, what you've done the most of, what nations 
did you particularly sort of admire in terms of

01:30.700 --> 01:44.739
their oceanographic ventures, besides 
ourselves? Well, of course, the Norwegians have

01:44.759 --> 01:50.247
been tremendous in the field. It started out with 
the dynamic meteorology, so that we had... And

01:59.101 --> 02:16.929
Anson, and Spadrup,

01:59.101 --> 02:16.929
Mosby, a number of people there early on that were 
involved. And certainly the dynamic part of it,

02:16.949 --> 02:26.104
Ekman and Bjerkenes and that group. started out 
and the same fluid dynamics applies to the ocean as

02:26.624 --> 02:36.554
does the atmosphere in different ways. But these

02:37.635 --> 02:44.742
people were very important. The Japanese, of 
course, have been a long time involved in it. They

02:53.091 --> 02:55.433
get mostly from the Outside of Hidaka, who was over 
here, spent some time with us, and Uta, and some of

02:55.767 --> 03:00.173
the others. They're mostly, a great many of them 
were involved in the fisheries, which is their

03:00.193 --> 03:07.844
lifeblood, as far as the ocean is concerned. 
They've sort of lived off of the ocean. We've had

03:12.892 --> 03:20.523
good contacts, in association with the 
Canadians. This last year, I was up to the to an

03:25.248 --> 03:38.526
affair honoring the physical oceanographers of 
Canada, the founding sort of physical

03:25.248 --> 03:38.526
oceanographers, in a way, of Canada. And we had 
Tully from the West Coast, Bill Cameron, Hatchie

03:38.546 --> 03:52.926
from the East Coast, and Picard, who came over 
after the war from England to Canada.

04:04.182 --> 04:22.643
So just where I've worked, a lot of it has been with

04:04.182 --> 04:22.643
Canadians from

04:04.182 --> 04:22.643
time to time, both on the East Coast and the West 
Coast. Now, I hate to ask you to hazard

04:25.002 --> 04:28.525
predictions. I realize that's always not kosher. 
But I'd like to sort of wind the interview down with

04:31.849 --> 04:37.454
a series of questions that students would like to 
ask you primarily.

04:41.698 --> 04:53.710
What do you think was the single most important 
development in oceanography while you were

04:41.698 --> 04:53.710
involved in it during your long 40-odd year span? 
That is an exceedingly difficult question

04:55.968 --> 05:05.579
to answer. And

05:05.599 --> 05:22.819
I wouldn't look at a single development as much as a 
in some ways, a unification of the field.

05:31.718 --> 05:38.708
And I think a lot of this is sort of expressed in the 
book on the oceans. And I think that

05:41.051 --> 05:51.625
these sub-disciplines, although they 
contribute really to the understanding The final

05:52.600 --> 06:01.888
use that we make of those is going to require the 
cooperation of people of different disciplines.

06:03.129 --> 06:06.212
This is still hard to get across in this present 
day. But I think it doesn't mean that people have to

06:06.773 --> 06:14.860
be experts in all the different areas, because no 
one can. But at least there should be free

06:15.681 --> 06:22.607
communication from one group to another. There's 
far too much effort that has been spent on pursuing

06:23.043 --> 06:36.698
things that, from another viewpoint, would have 
been perfectly illogical.

06:39.921 --> 06:52.375
So I think that, of course, there's no question 
about

06:39.921 --> 06:52.375
the advance in the technology here. And I think in 
some ways the early days were a little bit like this

06:52.945 --> 07:04.921
skipper trying to get to the iceberg.

07:08.926 --> 07:15.174
So we've come a long ways in that respect. Was there 
any single amazing discovery in oceanography

07:15.194 --> 07:21.282
that seemed to amaze you the most? in your career, 
anything that took you simply off balance?

07:30.765 --> 07:37.933
I don't think that I was built to be caught too much 
by surprise.

07:41.196 --> 07:49.885
There's been a lot of things that I've really 
appreciated that's come along, and the great

07:41.196 --> 07:49.885
developments and strides that have been been made 
here. But I think a lot of the sort of big strides

07:52.249 --> 08:06.389
have been from a certain amount of group effort. 
And of course, with the increasing number of

08:07.871 --> 08:15.602
people, you don't see the ones that particularly 
stand out head and shoulders above all others.

08:22.230 --> 08:37.473
They're based on a fairly sound foundation, and so 
much of it has been in the nature of this

08:22.230 --> 08:37.473
cooperative work, even though some of them don't 
speak to each other yet. That's always been a

08:37.493 --> 08:42.660
problem.

08:42.680 --> 08:45.184
Now, excuse me. Suppose you were simply to name one 
thing in your career that you thought you had

08:47.611 --> 08:55.079
enjoyed the most in oceanography. What would you 
choose?

09:01.545 --> 09:16.521
I've never worked on a job yet that I couldn't find 
some satisfaction in doing and some challenge

09:01.545 --> 09:16.521
all the way from my Piling lumber to theoretical 
problems. It's always been interesting to me.

09:33.081 --> 09:39.550
And it would be hard for me to say, well, now, just 
what I would like to go out and do. Now, what I'm

09:39.811 --> 09:45.158
doing at the moment is trying to... round up a 
little bit more on the circulation of water

09:46.032 --> 10:00.766
properties in Puget Sound that I've been looking 
at since the early 30s out in the Sound, a little bit

09:46.032 --> 10:00.766
before. And if we look at the ship canal problem.

10:08.733 --> 10:14.959
So it's

10:08.733 --> 10:14.959
hard to say.

10:16.458 --> 10:20.084
to pick out the real highlights. I really 
appreciate the efforts that were put in by some

10:20.164 --> 10:38.775
very dedicated people that came out of a 
cooperation when we were in the emergency during

10:20.164 --> 10:38.775
the war, World War II, that really brought an awful 
lot of people together. And I think above some of

10:38.815 --> 10:43.242
the personal differences because there were an 
awful lot of personal differences in this group

10:43.812 --> 11:09.027
but i really think that they established then a a 
very good foundation for the

10:43.812 --> 11:09.027
future in oceanography and i think we can see the 
results of that that goes right back into the 40s

10:43.812 --> 11:09.027
right up this uh present time. We're still 
enjoying some of the fruits of the efforts of some

11:10.366 --> 11:18.575
of these dedicated individuals.

11:18.595 --> 11:23.020
I take it that you would not change careers if you 
had to do all over again. You would not remain with

11:23.060 --> 11:25.583
chemistry. You'd go to oceanography.

11:29.928 --> 11:37.917
Well, there's still chemistry in oceanography, 
although I haven't. that I haven't done any

11:38.538 --> 11:43.323
legitimate chemistry for a long time. It's one of 
the things that we started to do on the jobs I'd

11:43.463 --> 11:47.948
never finished. At Woods' home, we thought if the 
situation deteriorated too much, we'd no longer

11:48.128 --> 12:01.423
be able to get our standard water from Copenhagen, 
and so we made up our own at Woods Hole. I was

12:06.710 --> 12:28.423
instrumental in going out on the soil on that and 
collecting up the water and bottling it up and so

12:06.710 --> 12:28.423
on, running some tests, which I never finished all 
the tests because the things got under control

12:06.710 --> 12:28.423
before it was necessary to push that. than a 
routine job. But I'm still concerned with the

12:31.144 --> 12:45.140
interaction of the physical and the biological in 
the water system, which is a problem that is far

12:31.144 --> 12:45.140
from being solved. It's very, very complex. And so 
I never looked a little bit at the Columbia River

12:48.844 --> 12:58.174
affluent at sea.

13:00.398 --> 13:02.702
been involved in that. But it's hard to pick out any 
one thing. Or I don't think that I have any regret

13:08.633 --> 13:16.027
for the different steps I've taken over the years. 
Is there anything else you'd like to add to the

13:18.392 --> 13:20.095
tape?

13:26.740 --> 13:47.363
Well, I still think that anyone that is going ahead 
in science owes it to himself to be fairly broadly

13:26.740 --> 13:47.363
based, not that he is going to be an expert in any 
particular, in more than one particular facet.

13:48.404 --> 13:53.490
But he certainly wants to have an appreciation of 
the interaction of his sub-discipline with the

13:54.280 --> 13:59.792
others in some way or another.

14:03.219 --> 14:11.336
The body has many different digits and so on, but 
they've all got to work together somehow.

14:11.356 --> 14:11.857
Good enough. I agree.
