WEBVTT

00:03.575 --> 00:07.179
I believe it's April the 10th, and this is tape 
number three. Transcriber, when we transcribe

00:07.219 --> 00:14.748
these, just continue where we ended off on tape 
number two. Dr. Hubert, now try yours. Okay.

00:21.395 --> 00:24.659
We're here in the cabin and ready to proceed. As

00:24.719 --> 00:32.147
we go back to the early 1960s, One of the truly 
revolutionary changes at A&M came as a result of

00:32.600 --> 00:41.131
all of the work on what was then called the Century 
Study. Do you have any recollection as to where

00:42.392 --> 00:51.844
that idea for a major look forward and an internal 
study, where that came from? Who proposed that?

00:55.709 --> 00:56.409
Who thought it up? I don't know. who originated the 
concept, the idea of a century study for Texas A&M.

01:08.541 --> 01:23.987
I do know that although it was not inaugurated 
until early 60s, that some thought was being given

01:08.541 --> 01:23.987
to it in the late 50s in 1959 when I came aboard 
Because as I indicated earlier, I think my

01:24.406 --> 01:39.823
experience on the committee of 75 over at the 
University of Texas gave me an edge up in being

01:24.406 --> 01:39.823
selected for the position that I first occupied. 
But who actually said, let's do it at A&M is unknown

01:41.845 --> 01:47.451
to me. Do you remember anything other than 
optimism about that uh effort no as it was

01:53.583 --> 02:19.118
beginning it was enthusiastically received by 
all constituents so far as i know haskell i don't

01:53.583 --> 02:19.118
think of a i can't remember a single negative voice 
concerning the the

01:53.583 --> 02:19.118
the conduct of the century council study uh The 
quality of the people selected for the century

02:21.258 --> 02:25.243
Council. The fact that it was about half and half. 
Farmer student non farmer student. The fact that

02:34.214 --> 02:37.859
there were a number of outstanding women. On the 
Council.

02:43.927 --> 02:48.092
These things themselves brought a new tone to the 
effort. and I think we're helpful in its getting

02:48.562 --> 02:54.229
launched. The University of Texas had just a short 
time before concluded its Committee of 75 study,

02:54.249 --> 03:16.257
and that may have prompted A&M, I don't know, to 
proceed accordingly as a mechanism for deciding

02:54.249 --> 03:16.257
upon its future. But nonetheless, it was a 
fantastic experience for all parties, I believe.

03:26.830 --> 03:29.794
It was, I think, fast moving. It

03:30.715 --> 03:40.168
addressed the questions that were relevant to the 
university. What kind of university do we expect

03:42.325 --> 03:48.795
to have on our centennial anniversary? What kind 
of student body do we want to have? What kind of

03:53.602 --> 03:55.685
programs and curricula? Where should our 
strengths be? Questions of that magnitude, and it

04:00.552 --> 04:06.621
was well done. Concurrent with the Century 
Council study, was one done by the faculty

04:11.165 --> 04:17.470
called the Aspiration Study. And it too, it in fact 
was more specific in its content than was the

04:18.311 --> 04:28.860
Century Council Study. The Century Council Study 
was in some ways pretty highly generalized in its

04:28.880 --> 04:40.750
recommendations. Whereas the aspiration study 
was far more to the point and more specific. And I

04:48.262 --> 04:58.975
think a blend of the two helped chart the course for 
the university in the years to come.

05:03.540 --> 05:10.568
How did faculty members like me get selected for 
the aspirations committee? Who selected the

05:12.556 --> 05:14.678
members, do you know? Did you deans make 
recommendations? I think we did, Haskell, yes.

05:23.367 --> 05:41.685
And I think the Koch building had some choices 
also, but nominations also came from the deans of

05:23.367 --> 05:41.685
the four colleges, schools. Was there any hint in 
your recollection of any high-level

05:42.020 --> 05:52.233
predetermination of membership or anything? 
That is, the board or Mr. Rutter or somebody

05:54.155 --> 05:59.942
saying, put this one, this one, this one? No, I 
don't recall that. Some of that may have happened.

06:06.571 --> 06:08.133
I never heard of any. I don't recall of it. I don't 
recall it at all. those

06:12.783 --> 06:41.119
committees met and their work I know that we call 
the aspirations committee we had what we called

06:12.783 --> 06:41.119
working parties to look at specific topics as 
those committees were doing their work do you

06:12.783 --> 06:41.119
remember much apprehension of anybody as to what 
the final recommendations might be from the

06:41.656 --> 07:08.659
aspirations committee yes sir

06:41.656 --> 07:08.659
I can't pinpoint anything there may be there may 
have been some anxiety again in the Koch building

06:41.656 --> 07:08.659
I'm not sure but

06:41.656 --> 07:08.659
I I don't remember that among the Dean's there was 
any concern. Among the deans or their equivalent,

07:11.009 --> 07:27.172
among the key administrators, do you recall 
anyone who was more

07:11.009 --> 07:27.172
conservative about any change at that time than 
any of the others? Yes, yes. I think agriculture

07:29.215 --> 07:34.462
was far more concerned about big changes. And and 
was somewhat lethargic in embracing some of the

07:38.643 --> 07:44.631
changes. Were you one of the more, using the word 
liberal now as receptive to change, do you think

07:45.572 --> 07:54.323
you were seen as one of the more liberal deans at 
that point? I think so, Haskell.

08:00.852 --> 08:07.080
In fact, a few years later, when...

08:08.107 --> 08:20.008
The then College of Arts and Sciences was 
reorganized into a College of Science and a

08:08.107 --> 08:20.008
College of Liberal Arts. There was some concern 
among

08:22.613 --> 08:31.549
key administrators, the top ones, about the use of 
the word liberal arts. Really, really. And in

08:39.424 --> 08:47.891
fact, I was asked if I had considered a College of 
Humanities as the title.

08:53.015 --> 09:02.363
But the College of Liberal Arts title prevailed 
and was finally accepted, although there, there

09:02.798 --> 09:08.243
was some skepticism about the word liberal in the 
liberal arts. I was asked at a retreat for

09:10.366 --> 09:27.022
administrators that was held up near Teague, 
Texas at some utilities company meeting house. I

09:28.624 --> 09:32.788
was asked, why is it that you people in the liberal 
arts are always the ones who raise cane around

09:34.017 --> 09:39.625
here.

09:49.961 --> 09:51.463
It was an interesting session. I introduced my 
colleagues to the trivium

09:51.483 --> 10:02.860
and the quadrivium from Greek and Roman times when 
the liberal arts were first expressed in those

10:03.852 --> 10:11.885
terms. And it was intended to be a serious

10:12.986 --> 10:26.147
effort on the part of knowledge purveyors to 
embrace those basic disciplines which were

10:26.988 --> 10:48.692
non-vocational in nature and which in fact would 
free, thus liberal, would free the individual

10:26.988 --> 10:48.692
from having to participate in menial types of jobs 
and effort, et cetera.

10:51.895 --> 10:55.459
I was much better prepared on that occasion than I 
am now to elaborate upon that early development of

10:56.182 --> 11:05.419
the liberal arts through the trivium and the 
quadrivium. But it was, I think, an eye-opener for

11:06.741 --> 11:15.517
some of my colleagues. And I think they felt better 
about it after that

11:22.372 --> 11:34.787
effort on my part to explain the essence and nature 
of the studies which comprise the liberal arts

11:22.372 --> 11:34.787
sector. Now, the work of the Aspirations 
Committee took more than a year. It and all of its

11:40.894 --> 11:44.719
subunits that we call the working parties. Were 
you and your colleagues in the administration

11:45.660 --> 11:51.687
aware of some of the probable recommendations 
before the aspirations report was finished? I

11:57.279 --> 11:59.261
don't recall that we were, Haskell. Weren't 
supposed to be. I don't recall that we were at all.

12:03.765 --> 12:16.997
When the report was finished and the 
recommendation for co-education, voluntary

12:03.765 --> 12:16.997
core, racial integration and so forth, what were 
the initial reactions of the people that you

12:03.765 --> 12:16.997
recall? Mixed. There was still among the members 
of the Century Council some true original

12:20.219 --> 12:49.534
Aggies who did not support wholeheartedly the 
move to coeducational and to a voluntary

12:20.219 --> 12:49.534
military. they did not take it easily. And I'm 
going to say among this number, there may have been

12:57.068 --> 13:09.465
half a dozen out of the 100 who

12:57.068 --> 13:09.465
constituted the members of the Century Council. 
But

13:10.246 --> 13:20.500
they did not indicate that they wanted to present a 
minority report. And I think Harold Dunn's

13:21.830 --> 13:36.109
leadership in that regard was another key element 
in the success of the conclusion of the study. The

13:38.652 --> 13:50.267
final report then, who were some of the strongest 
supporters on campus that you recall to endorse

13:38.652 --> 13:50.267
it? Oh, on campus? Yes,

13:51.943 --> 13:56.551
sir. I think it was pretty universally accepted 
and supported, Haskell. I can't point out any

14:02.501 --> 14:11.456
single voices that were strongest in its support. 
Those who might have been

14:19.762 --> 14:26.670
slow to accept it, were quiet, as I recall. Mr. 
Rutter, as far as you know, his initial reaction? I

14:31.976 --> 14:34.219
think it was favorable, Haskell, yes. Now, I 
understand from Wayne Hall that one of the

14:35.440 --> 14:44.171
recommendations that bothered Mr. Rutter was 
leaving the A&M out of the title. Yes, that would

14:44.191 --> 14:47.895
have... been a great concern to him. He wanted the 
A&M brand

14:52.713 --> 14:59.723
locked in. Do you remember any attempt by any board 
member to

15:00.784 --> 15:10.238
contradict or counteract anything? No. No, I 
don't recall at all. Now, as I look back on that

15:14.804 --> 15:17.308
board, I say to a number of observers that Mr. 
Rutter was fortunate in that he had a number of

15:18.183 --> 15:29.137
people on the board then who had had major 
management experience. Yes. And that that helped

15:30.238 --> 15:33.602
them not to be nitpickers and micromanagers. Yes. 
Let's see. Was the chairman of the board of

15:37.126 --> 15:42.733
Tentaco, was he on board by that time? I think so. 
And Sterling Evans. And Dow Chemical. Dow

15:46.583 --> 15:47.724
Chemical, Boyle. Vice President. Boyle. Al 
Davies, former CEO of Sears. Yes. Dick Goodson,

15:53.871 --> 15:55.713
former CEO of Southwestern. Yes. Oh, yes. These 
are great names, and they were strongly

15:57.275 --> 16:04.803
supportive of the council study. All right. As the 
aspirations, I mean, as those recommendations

16:06.304 --> 16:16.135
began to take effect, share some experiences you 
may recall as to the effects at the working level of

16:16.773 --> 16:24.061
women enrolling and of black students being 
admitted? It

16:24.081 --> 16:40.620
was a period of,

16:24.081 --> 16:40.620
at the working level, in the office, at the desk,

16:44.077 --> 16:45.700
keeping the network alive. It was a rapid pace 
environment. Things were happening so rapidly.

16:55.739 --> 16:57.522
Enrollment picked up quickly. Space was a 
problem.

17:03.449 --> 17:05.912
Women were delightful. They added such a great new 
chemistry to the campus, a great new

17:06.513 --> 17:13.984
characteristic. Do you remember any anecdotes to 
illustrate that? No. No, I don't. It was just so

17:24.779 --> 17:29.085
fine to have them aboard. I think it helped with

17:30.668 --> 17:43.281
the behavior of the student body general. In the 
presence of a lady, one tends to be more careful

17:44.502 --> 17:58.296
with one's behavior and language and so forth, and 
I think in that regard it was a great additive to the

17:44.502 --> 17:58.296
campus. That's not to say that before they came 
there was not an

17:58.580 --> 18:13.743
acceptable level of performance in that regard, 
but they added that element.

18:18.830 --> 18:24.098
I was concerned about getting new curricula 
going. I was concerned, and this is without regard

18:25.293 --> 18:29.841
to women and minorities. This was with respect to 
the essential components of a college of liberal

18:30.001 --> 18:38.535
arts. I was concerned about getting a philosophy 
department going. That was my number one

18:43.423 --> 18:47.550
ambition, a department of philosophy. I dearly 
wanted to see it come about. I also wanted at

18:53.778 --> 18:57.122
another level. I wanted to get geography out of 
agriculture.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.012
And that happened. How did you do that?

19:09.457 --> 19:10.779
Simply mainly by. Indicating to the front office 
that it needed to be done. And I had some at that time

19:17.527 --> 19:20.511
Ed. Duran, a geographer, I think was supportive of 
the idea. Smith, as I recall, who had been in

19:28.937 --> 19:43.755
geography with Schleselmann many, many years, 
was supportive of it, and he was an old liner in the

19:28.937 --> 19:43.755
College of Agriculture. So that happened. Where 
did you get the resources for philosophy?

19:50.883 --> 19:53.185
Interesting, it came about in this way. At that 
time, early 60s and far beyond earlier,

19:55.807 --> 20:14.665
the several churches on the periphery of the 
campus offered courses in the Bible. The courses

20:17.107 --> 20:20.670
were built into the catalog They were placed in the 
catalog in such a way that they were

20:20.988 --> 20:37.895
non-denominational, thereby exempting their 
offering from being criticized as

20:20.988 --> 20:37.895
denominationalism.

20:41.761 --> 20:47.670
And almost every, I think almost every sect around 
the campus had its campus minister who taught a

20:48.376 --> 20:54.445
course. And they taught the course in their 
building, not on campus.

21:01.655 --> 21:05.601
Now here's the trick they added to make it purely 
denominational. In the battalion, each semester

21:06.542 --> 21:14.974
before registration, they would run a little 
block advertisement saying,

21:19.122 --> 21:24.489
I don't know what the tag was for religion. Was it 
religion itself? Or was it humanities? I don't

21:30.676 --> 21:31.177
know. But we'll say it was religion. Religion 101, 
the Old Testament. Section 21,

21:37.906 --> 21:47.037
Father Donahoe. location in the Catholic Student 
Union, well, you know, that's, and likewise for

21:48.873 --> 22:08.516
each other, each other denomination or sector of 
the churches around the campus. And under the

22:08.736 --> 22:16.886
Coordinating Board formula system, that earned 
some student credit hour dollars for Texas A&M.

22:17.527 --> 22:17.867
Yes. Now then, I learned on one occasion, and I 
picked this up through the registrar's office, I

22:19.062 --> 22:49.052
think I got a tip from, I don't know that it was Lloyd 
Heaton himself or someone in the registrar's

22:19.062 --> 22:49.052
office, that in one of these classes in religion 
being offered off campus, and I must say I honestly

22:19.062 --> 22:49.052
do not recall which

22:49.589 --> 23:08.598
which church it was associated with, there was a 
prof, a campus minister teaching the course

22:49.589 --> 23:08.598
who was very

22:49.589 --> 23:08.598
liberal in student comings and goings. You really 
didn't have to attend. And there were some

23:13.085 --> 23:17.892
students who would register, I'm told, I was told 
at the time, some students who would register for

23:18.462 --> 23:26.790
the course and during an entire semester might 
attend five times. Then at the end of the course

23:28.832 --> 23:37.460
would receive a passing grade of A or B and get 
credit for it.

23:42.985 --> 23:47.389
I verified this information, then took it to 
President Rutter I says, we're open for a lot of

23:47.707 --> 23:54.816
serious embarrassment over this situation. And 
we need to reclaim these courses in religion and

23:56.478 --> 24:15.163
get them taught on campus by people whom we select, 
whom we exercise some authority over. And We need

24:19.162 --> 24:20.523
to do it quickly. He says, you think it's that bad? I 
said, yes, sir, I certainly do. It would just take

24:25.148 --> 24:35.919
one newspaper to pick it up from somewhere from the 
battalion and what we're doing, and it would be so

24:25.148 --> 24:35.919
embarrassing. He said, what shall we do? I says, we 
need to create a department of philosophy.

24:46.290 --> 24:46.931
And we did. He said, OK. Who are you going to get to 
run it? I said, I'll employ someone. I'll go to the

24:54.698 --> 24:56.701
key places and find. Among the searches that I made 
for our first department head in philosophy, I

24:56.721 --> 25:07.219
went to Yale.

25:13.691 --> 25:14.532
There I met. I had corresponded with him earlier. I 
met John Orr, O-R-R, brilliant young guy,

25:17.992 --> 25:40.266
Presbyterian, incidentally, and he had just 
finished his doctorate in philosophy, and he had

25:17.992 --> 25:40.266
also had his, he had been in the Yale program of I 
don't know whether they call it a divinity or a

25:41.242 --> 26:09.055
seminary or what but He had been through that 
Excellent program in religion and had his degree

25:41.242 --> 26:09.055
there along with his doctorate in philosophy So I 
thought that would make him more acceptable to the

25:41.242 --> 26:09.055
campus ministers having that background

25:41.242 --> 26:09.055
I Met with the ministers told them of our plans and 
that we were going to bring the Department of

26:09.676 --> 26:24.171
Philosophy on board and that when we did, we would 
discontinue the off-campus offerings. They

26:24.191 --> 26:25.592
accepted it okay. I think they were aware all the 
time that

26:27.174 --> 26:38.485
it was an

26:27.174 --> 26:38.485
unsafe situation. John Orr came aboard, did a 
great job as a one-man department. He was

26:45.283 --> 26:47.886
department head and faculty the first year. 
Students hearing about it and registering for the

26:49.747 --> 26:59.396
courses just became thirsty for it, Haskell, 
really excited about the language and

26:49.747 --> 26:59.396
philosophy. And next year I think John employed 
Manuel Davenport. I think Manuel came from One of

27:08.958 --> 27:13.843
the California schools, I want to say, but he came 
with excellent credentials. He was had received.

27:19.089 --> 27:24.194
I think at his institution that which was called 
the Albert Schweitzer. Award for teaching.

27:31.062 --> 27:36.788
Made a great impression during the interview and 
we brought him on board and excellent for the

27:37.004 --> 27:39.266
department all the way through. So we got the 
Department of Philosophy started in that

27:39.306 --> 27:45.332
fashion.

27:49.896 --> 27:50.516
Let's see. Then it was time to separate education 
and psychology. We did not have on the campus at

27:59.885 --> 28:04.429
that time any

28:06.181 --> 28:15.897
practicing experimental psychologist

28:06.181 --> 28:15.897
or a clinical psychologist. That was far, far out 
of reach for us. But we needed an experimentalist

28:20.003 --> 28:33.285
who could do some basic research and teaching in 
the field of psychology and ultimately work

28:20.003 --> 28:33.285
toward a degree in psychology.

28:37.687 --> 28:41.210
Again, another interesting development. At that 
time, Dr. Sidney O. Brown, professor in the

28:45.474 --> 29:07.693
Department of Biology, had a contract with the 
United States Air Force doing research on goats,

28:45.474 --> 29:07.693
tracking physiological changes in goats after 
they had been exposed to low doses of radiation out

29:08.635 --> 29:22.294
at our nuclear science center, actually built a 
goat shed out there, pens and goats.

29:24.477 --> 29:37.275
He would expose the animals to low doses of 
radiation, then would examine them and their

29:24.477 --> 29:37.275
carcasses closely. The results were just from 
well received by the Air Force. This is great

29:44.788 --> 29:45.970
stuff. And they came back to Dr. Brown after a 
couple of years of this research and they asked

29:46.630 --> 29:56.443
him, Dr. Brown, will you add another dimension to 
your research? And that is, we'd like to know what

29:56.543 --> 30:03.172
behavioral changes take place. Brown says, 
that's not my field, but I'll see about adding a

30:09.925 --> 30:22.204
staff member to my research team who's an 
experimental psychologist and see if we can't get

30:09.925 --> 30:22.204
into that field. Brown came to me and said, told me 
this story that had been asked of him. And he said,

30:30.717 --> 30:37.688
I'd like to, he says, I think I can, I know a 
connection over at the University of Texas. where

30:38.343 --> 30:52.243
I can go over there and get them to let me have a 
half-time psychologist to come over here,

30:38.343 --> 30:52.243
appropriate intervals, and assist me in 
research.

30:55.908 --> 31:01.195
I said, have

30:55.908 --> 31:01.195
you made any contacts there yet? No, I have not. I 
said, let me make a suggestion. If your contract

31:07.368 --> 31:14.699
will pay for half of a faculty person, I'll pay the 
other half. Let's bring him here full time on that

31:14.719 --> 31:22.931
basis and have him begin teaching some courses in 
experimental psychology. Good. Brown was

31:24.473 --> 31:29.100
receptive to the idea and we did that. At that time, 
Dr. Walter Varvel, was the principal

31:34.199 --> 31:46.752
psychologist I felt on campus, and he was in the 
Department of Educational Psychology teaching

31:34.199 --> 31:46.752
counseling courses and doing it admirably. His

31:46.792 --> 31:58.124
degree, however, had been in experimental 
psychology, as I recall, University of Kansas.

32:01.948 --> 32:03.430
I asked him for his help. in finding an 
experimentalist, a young person who could team up

32:03.933 --> 32:10.160
with John Orr. No, not with John Orr, but with 
Sidney Brown, and do this work. Of course, he did a

32:19.390 --> 32:21.272
natural thing. He first contacted, I think, the 
University of Kansas. They gave him glowing

32:24.996 --> 32:29.962
remarks about a young doctorate named Casey. Ben 
Casey or Albert Casey? Albert, one of the two. He

32:39.103 --> 32:40.024
came aboard. And I often say that, well, not often, 
but I sometimes say that

32:40.044 --> 32:59.212
our psychology department grew out of a goat 
research experiment. That's not too well

32:59.232 --> 33:03.758
received, but I think it has some basis in fact. But 
it's good for a land grant school that it grew out of

33:04.058 --> 33:10.047
a goat herd. Yes.

33:13.892 --> 33:17.578
Another interesting development at this time, 
Haskell.

33:21.043 --> 33:27.232
And this likewise has to do with program 
expansion. And this is the story of the cyclotron.

33:33.927 --> 33:49.933
I'm not sure of the first portion of this, but I have 
a hunch

33:33.927 --> 33:49.933
that one morning at breakfast, somewhere along 
the line,

33:33.927 --> 33:49.933
W.T. Doc Daugherty, senior fellow with the Welch 
Foundation in Houston, and a devoted Aggie,

34:04.100 --> 34:21.027
at breakfast with Earl Rudder said, Earl,

34:04.100 --> 34:21.027
much of the cutting edge research in chemistry in 
the years ahead is going to be done with a

34:04.100 --> 34:21.027
cyclotron. We need one.

34:27.697 --> 34:30.782
And with that beginning,

34:34.846 --> 34:43.381
Incidentally, I think President Rudder had great 
respect and regard for any recommendation that

34:34.846 --> 34:43.381
W.T. Doherty made.

34:48.731 --> 34:59.250
And so President Rudder began his quest for a 
cyclotron.

35:02.268 --> 35:05.734
Where do you go to learn something about a 
cyclotron? Haskell, at that moment, we did not

35:06.255 --> 35:17.835
have a single member of our faculty who had ever 
performed any experiment whatsoever on a

35:06.255 --> 35:17.835
cyclotron. None.

35:21.942 --> 35:26.790
I think I'm kind in saying we were cyclotron 
illiterate.

35:33.892 --> 35:36.055
President Rutter said, I'll tell you what we'll 
do. We'll take a team out to the University of

35:37.797 --> 35:54.781
California at Berkeley and visit their cyclotron 
Livermore Laboratories, see what's going on out

35:37.797 --> 35:54.781
there, what a cyclotron looks like, what it does.

35:57.564 --> 35:59.928
Let's get acquainted with a cyclotron.

36:02.291 --> 36:03.072
And so I was asked to go out there along with Tom 
Cherry, Fred Benson,

36:03.423 --> 36:13.998
a couple of others. I don't recall who they were. We

36:16.262 --> 36:23.452
visited for a couple of days on the Berkeley 
campus. This was early 60s now, and the student

36:31.267 --> 36:34.352
unrest out there was expressing itself every 
hour. We walked through student groups every time

36:34.372 --> 36:38.839
we crossed the campus.

36:42.384 --> 36:58.489
I went out there, President Rutter asked me also, 
Frank, I want you to see if you can find out what

36:42.384 --> 36:58.489
they're doing in closed circuit television, what 
they're teaching in television on their campus.

36:59.195 --> 37:04.524
and see if you can get some clues as to how we might 
get started in that game." Tom Cherry and I were

37:07.068 --> 37:10.574
paired up to do that search.

37:15.262 --> 37:18.587
We visited the cyclotron.

37:20.153 --> 37:30.550
made prearrangements for someone to meet with Tom 
Cherry and me and give us a guide through their

37:20.153 --> 37:30.550
educational television system. It happened to be 
Mel Chastain who was assigned to us. And we toured

37:36.680 --> 37:40.065
the campus. They had only a closed circuit, but it 
was an effective one.

37:47.137 --> 38:03.781
When we got home, I

37:47.137 --> 38:03.781
prepared my report to President Rutter that it was 
feasible, gave him an estimate on what the cost

37:47.137 --> 38:03.781
would be, and I underestimated it, I think. But 
nonetheless, he said, fine, got started.

38:12.694 --> 38:15.017
I told him about the Chastain chap. and that I'd 
like to bring him to campus if I could. We brought

38:21.001 --> 38:27.267
him to campus, offered him a job, and that's how we 
got started in educational television. First as a

38:27.347 --> 38:30.811
closed circuit system.

38:35.315 --> 38:40.840
The cyclotron

38:35.315 --> 38:40.840
was an interesting development. Fred Benson 
initially was Let's see, what was the title given

38:45.355 --> 38:48.079
to a person? Project coordinator. That member of 
the faculty, that member of the university staff,

38:52.467 --> 39:06.790
who represented the faculty's point of view about 
the building.

39:09.689 --> 39:11.312
Was it project coordinator? I've forgotten what 
the title was. Nonetheless, Fred Benson started

39:13.135 --> 39:34.633
out in that position, but after he got started and 
met some people and brought some consultants to

39:13.135 --> 39:34.633
the campus, and I met with all of them, mainly 
because it was Fred's good recommendation that

39:13.135 --> 39:34.633
the cyclotron should be more associated with the 
Department of Physics. than it should be with the

39:35.660 --> 39:40.706
Texas Engineering Experiment Station.

39:43.449 --> 39:59.386
Fred learned from a consultant who was an employee 
of the Livermore Radiation Laboratory that at

39:43.449 --> 39:59.386
Berkeley, the laboratory people did not have 
faculty status. And he said that was a great bone of

40:01.268 --> 40:05.413
contention every day out there. He said, so when 
you start out, give your people faculty status

40:05.984 --> 40:11.250
somewhere. And he says, they're all physicists, 
mainly. So physics is a natural location for them.

40:18.599 --> 40:23.705
At any rate, I wound up as project coordinator for 
the cyclotron, if you can imagine that. But the

40:24.827 --> 40:25.928
deal was this. And I think this developed from Mr. 
Dougherty. Mr. Dougherty said, Earl, The Welch

40:33.659 --> 40:35.821
Foundation will give you $1 million.

40:42.247 --> 40:46.490
You've got to try to see if you can get the Atomic 
Energy Commission to give you a million. And the

40:47.871 --> 40:49.913
university ought to put up a million. And for $3 
million, you ought to get started in the cyclotron

40:50.654 --> 40:55.098
business. That was an underestimate also. But 
nonetheless, that's the way it started out.

41:08.776 --> 41:13.301
The university was to build the building and 
supply the staff. The Atomic Energy Commission

41:14.963 --> 41:34.506
was to provide the cyclotron instrument itself, 
that huge piece of equipment, and provide funding

41:14.963 --> 41:34.506
for the research on a continuing basis.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.488
This was early 63.

41:41.530 --> 41:49.241
as I recall.

41:49.261 --> 41:50.843
Yeah. And I've got a sneeze coming up if it 
materializes.

42:01.960 --> 42:02.540
Excuse me. We had

42:04.463 --> 42:11.233
the consultants in

42:16.225 --> 42:38.908
They did the initial development for a proposal 
and a plan for the cyclotron, but said very

42:16.225 --> 42:38.908
quickly, you must tell someone on your faculty 
right now, preferably as a member of the

42:16.225 --> 42:38.908
Department of Physics who has had cyclotron 
experience, can write a proposal for a cyclotron.

42:40.306 --> 42:45.293
and write the scientific proposals for research 
to be supported. So you can take it to the Atomic

42:46.514 --> 42:53.383
Energy Commission and get this funding.

42:57.929 --> 43:06.921
The university employed a professor from, who had 
had experience at Berkeley, by the name of George

42:57.929 --> 43:06.921
Aigo, Aigo. Prior to that time, however, it was 
necessary to go to the Atomic Energy Commission,

43:07.610 --> 43:26.388
Tennessee, at their Oak Ridge location, and 
negotiate the contract, the final details of the

43:07.610 --> 43:26.388
contract. The three negotiators the university 
sent up there were Clyde Freeman, distinguished

43:26.408 --> 43:35.997
physicist, Donald Simon, At that time, my 
assistant, outstanding scientist, and Frank

43:36.972 --> 43:42.297
Hubert. And you know, I've never had a course in 
physics. Chemistry, yes. Physics, no. But we went

43:53.128 --> 44:03.418
to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the Atomic Energy 
Headquarters building there, sat down across the

43:53.128 --> 44:03.418
table. Facing us were 13 scientists. members of 
the AEC staff. There were scientists, there were

44:09.845 --> 44:22.917
auditors, there were administrators,

44:09.845 --> 44:22.917
the complete

44:09.845 --> 44:22.917
ensemble.

44:28.522 --> 44:34.587
Well, you know, I've forgotten the name of the 
fellow who chaired that group. But he said, well,

44:35.410 --> 44:41.177
how shall we get started, Dean Hubert? I said, 
well, the first thing I'd like to know. It was

44:45.041 --> 44:50.668
already agreed that we would do the building, and 
they would provide the instrument.

44:53.291 --> 44:58.397
I said, the first thing I'd like to know is, where 
does the cyclotron start?

45:01.668 --> 45:06.573
I knew it had to have lots of electrical power and it 
had to be plugged in somewhere. I says, does the

45:07.314 --> 45:11.998
cyclotron begin at the point where it is plugged 
in?

45:15.181 --> 45:22.629
I'd like a clear distinction in my mind between the 
instrument and the building in terms of cost

45:15.181 --> 45:22.629
allocation. Well, that opened it up easily for us 
to follow that track in terms of where the

45:32.718 --> 45:45.117
cyclotron begins and what it's going to cost and 
what kind of building it will require and what type

45:32.718 --> 45:45.117
of electrical power it will need. We spent a couple 
of hours with them, turned out well, came back,

45:46.880 --> 45:54.051
they approved Ultimately the contract George by 
that time George Igoe had written a scientific

45:54.706 --> 46:23.734
proposal for several research projects and It was 
funded and off off and running

45:54.706 --> 46:23.734
Such an experience but nonetheless At

45:54.706 --> 46:23.734
that time this was this was 63 remember now Haskell 
At that time, I'm

46:24.946 --> 46:39.178
told one of the pressing problems on President 
Kennedy's desk was, where shall the next

46:24.946 --> 46:39.178
cyclotron be built? Hubert Humphrey badly 
wanted...
