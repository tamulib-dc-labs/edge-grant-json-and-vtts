WEBVTT

00:03.119 --> 00:04.962
trying to develop this system. Who was the 
director of the? Hood Gibson, G.D. Gibson, and

00:06.825 --> 00:09.569
J.D. Pruitt was the associate director. He was the 
one that came to Matagorda County and talked to me

00:11.052 --> 00:16.020
about my interest in coming up here. I said, what 
does the future hold after that? Well, the future,

00:19.385 --> 00:27.658
you know, he planted the idea that, I guess I'd been 
spotted in terms of, you know, the work I've done

00:19.385 --> 00:27.658
with my master and so forth. He, um, suggested that 
maybe after that there might be a possibility for

00:30.237 --> 00:36.883
further graduate study that they see if they could 
find help for me. Compare the, these are the only

00:37.544 --> 00:43.390
salary numbers I'm going to ask, what was your, 
what was your, your... I remember my first salary,

00:43.410 --> 00:44.551
$2,650. That was here? No, at the county. At the 
county. And I guess I was, when I left Matagorda

00:48.295 --> 00:58.084
County, I was probably in the mid $3,000, $3,500, 
$3,800 in there, and I think when I came up here, I

00:58.520 --> 01:01.805
can't remember without referring, but it wasn't a 
lot more than that. And this is what year? 1955.

01:03.347 --> 01:04.508
1955. And you had to furnish a car. Now you've got 
some expenses for a car, usually a flat mile, but

01:06.291 --> 01:13.140
your county agent wore a car out almost every year. 
I mean, in fact, for a while there, I did have to buy a

01:13.180 --> 01:21.492
car almost every year because it went on so many 
miles. And when you got here, where were the

01:21.732 --> 01:24.095
offices? Well, they are now in the system 
building. Well... About that time, well, they had

01:27.848 --> 01:29.690
just moved. There used to be what's now the Trigon. 
The whole building was an extension building. And

01:35.716 --> 01:48.249
about the time when I came up here, they had located 
their headquarters offices in the system

01:35.716 --> 01:48.249
building on the north side of the system building, 
where they still are. And the specialists that had

01:48.269 --> 01:57.518
been all in one building together were then housed 
with the departments, the agronomists, the

01:48.269 --> 01:57.518
animal scientists, and so forth. So it was 
basically the administrative staff plus the

01:57.734 --> 02:04.801
bookkeeping and all of that. Well, they had more of 
that building. They had the second floor, too, the

02:10.227 --> 02:13.330
offices over there. And Director Gibson reported 
to whom, as far as you know? Well, there were

02:19.736 --> 02:25.682
several reorganizations, and through the years 
there was always a change. I think at that time he

02:26.287 --> 02:30.912
reported to the president of the system. I guess at 
that time, I don't know when the system

02:31.433 --> 02:36.399
organization came in. It comes and goes. It comes 
and goes. But I think basically he reported to

02:40.644 --> 02:43.627
Gilchrist, I guess. And where did you and your wife 
find a place to live? Over in South College

02:48.193 --> 02:49.634
Station. And we just rented because we had this 
notion that probably would be going off to further

02:55.598 --> 02:59.322
graduate study after that. And after finishing or 
doing pretty much all of this number crunching,

02:59.442 --> 03:24.711
and we didn't have all the fancy computers in those 
days, had to do everything with a calculator, we

02:59.442 --> 03:24.711
used the Gilmer-Akin thing as a model of trying to, 
what we came up with was we had a measure of what we

02:59.442 --> 03:24.711
thought the counties deserved in terms of a staff, 
and then a way to break down the finances. As I said,

03:28.368 --> 03:39.304
if a county had a lot of resources, they were 
expected to pay more and more for each particular

03:28.368 --> 03:39.304
agent because, I don't know if you're aware of 
this, agents always receive a part of their salary

03:28.368 --> 03:39.304
directly from the county. That's right. And 
usually the expenses, office, secretaries were

03:40.566 --> 03:52.583
furnished by the counties, and the agents were 
drawing anywhere from $20 to $30, $40, $50,

03:40.566 --> 03:52.583
depending on the situation, some of them much more 
than that, from the county. You'd get a separate

03:52.763 --> 03:53.785
check. You'd get a check from A&M and They took all 
the deductions out of here in terms of retirement

03:55.673 --> 04:01.360
programs and insurance and everything. And the 
county didn't do any of that. And so you had two

04:05.164 --> 04:10.050
checks that you got paid for. Anyway, after I had, 
and I worked in the administrative building over

04:10.731 --> 04:21.384
there because I had to have constant access to the 
administrative staff. And we often met with them

04:22.024 --> 04:24.347
to, you know, explore ideas and ways to do it, and 
then I'd have to do more number crunching, and they

04:24.817 --> 04:32.749
wanted this, and it didn't look right, so I'd do 
more number crunching. Anyway, I went through a

04:32.769 --> 04:45.167
lot of this, and then I also, during that period, 
was

04:32.769 --> 04:45.167
that afterwards? No, I guess that was later. 
Anyway, I came here in 55, and along about that

04:46.709 --> 04:53.980
time, They organized this National Extension 
Center for Advanced Study at University of

04:55.107 --> 05:07.283
Wisconsin, financed by Kellogg. And they gave 
fellowships, which means you didn't have to work.

05:13.691 --> 05:17.196
And it was considered a very generous fellowship 
if you could qualify. Well, I had a choice of going

05:17.636 --> 05:19.579
to There was another program that several 
administrators participated in was the public

05:20.335 --> 05:25.403
administration program at Harvard. But you'd get 
a doctorate of public administration, which,

05:26.044 --> 05:39.003
although it would have been nice to go to Harvard 
and have that in your record, I thought a PhD was

05:26.044 --> 05:39.003
probably better from anywhere else. And 
Wisconsin was fairly respectable as far as the

05:39.103 --> 05:44.551
graduate school is concerned. Anyway, Kellogg 
provided a grant for five years of getting Oh, a

05:50.980 --> 05:59.209
couple of dozen or so young people or mid-career 
people identified that might have other

05:50.980 --> 05:59.209
administrative potential. And it was a 
competitive thing. You applied, and if you got it,

06:01.872 --> 06:08.759
you got a, at that time, I think it was $4,800 a year 
tax-free income. And so in 1957, we took off. And as

06:13.504 --> 06:19.030
I think I mentioned to you before, I anticipated 
these moves. I finished the program in 18 months,

06:21.119 --> 06:30.449
if you can believe this, because I could study full 
time, and I also had, at that time they still

06:21.119 --> 06:30.449
required the two languages. I had done all of my 
homework on the languages and passed my exams on

06:31.130 --> 06:44.244
the languages very early, whereas most of my 
colleagues in the program were spending more time

06:31.130 --> 06:44.244
on the languages than they were on the courses. So I 
took a full load, got my languages out of the way,

06:44.264 --> 06:50.451
and then as far as my thesis study, further 
elaboration of this measuring county workload

06:50.971 --> 07:01.521
and financing thing and developed into a 350-page 
thesis. Now, did you take leave? I was given leave.

07:05.485 --> 07:07.887
Given leave without pay. But still. With no 
assurance that I'd get that particular job, but

07:09.249 --> 07:14.854
they said, you will have a job when you come back. 
And in fact, Hutchison was director by then. He

07:20.688 --> 07:22.350
wanted me to come back early. He kept pressuring. 
They had some assignments for me that they wanted

07:23.512 --> 07:26.235
me to do. And I had some other offers when I left 
there, but he arranged to offer me the assistant

07:27.176 --> 07:36.328
director position for some special activity 
areas. And that made me a member of the

07:36.448 --> 07:39.071
administrative staff. I guess I was only, what, 
30, 31 years old by then. But I became a part of the

07:42.395 --> 07:45.719
administration at that time. I guess when I was 
administrative assistant, I really wasn't

07:45.779 --> 07:48.703
officially a part. But he had me come back as 
assistant director. And that's 1957? No, that

07:55.203 --> 07:57.486
would be 59. I went to school in 57. 57, came back in 
59, and I think I became assistant director. I'm

08:04.476 --> 08:06.419
coming into the rudder years now, I guess. That's 
the same year I got here. I came back here in 59, in

08:07.881 --> 08:15.231
the spring of 59, and was involved in several 
special projects.

08:18.451 --> 08:27.303
Describe, as you came as assistant director, 
describe the Extension Service and its

08:18.451 --> 08:27.303
leadership. What was its organization? Well, 
John Hutchison was director by then, and he was an

08:30.327 --> 08:35.654
outstanding director. And I enjoyed serving with 
him. He was director, I guess, 19 years. And J.D.

08:45.286 --> 08:47.209
Pruitt was associate director. They made a good 
combination, Mr. Pruitt was not a what you call a

08:48.033 --> 09:08.573
gregarious person to deal with and I had of course 
going through administrative training programs

08:48.033 --> 09:08.573
I had always felt that an organization would work 
effectively if you could have what I call the Mr.

09:08.806 --> 09:10.448
Outside and Mr. Inside. And the outside man had to 
be the head man because most of the time people

09:10.968 --> 09:16.254
don't want to deal with the number two or three 
person. And I saw that operate. Hutchison was very

09:21.299 --> 09:25.464
effective working with the legislature, with the 
leadership in the state. Mr. Pruitt did the work

09:26.045 --> 09:35.775
back home in terms of all the staffing and budgets 
and personnel problems and all of that. I guess the

09:36.397 --> 09:39.883
administrative staff at that time was about eight 
or nine people. You had a state program leader for

09:39.923 --> 09:49.458
agriculture, one in home economics, 4-H, 
communications, fiscal, personnel, all of those

09:39.923 --> 09:49.458
types of things. And it was a good learning 
experience to work that closely to

09:50.540 --> 09:55.208
administration. Had the black and white agents 
yet been integrated? That came, I guess, In the

10:03.076 --> 10:03.877
60s. That involved me very heavily. Oh, okay. We 
had to go through a lot of the things at that time

10:08.544 --> 10:14.033
with that program. And also I got a lot of special 
assignments. Kellogg at that time had financed

10:19.882 --> 10:31.480
another program called the National Agriculture 
Communications Project, centered at Iowa State

10:19.882 --> 10:31.480
University, in which they trained two or three 
people in each state intensively, and it was kind

10:32.000 --> 10:45.394
of the in-thing then of principles of 
communication, organizations function better,

10:32.000 --> 10:45.394
people could communicate better, and you could 
reach audiences better. There was a lot of this was

10:45.934 --> 11:00.910
based on Bowen and Beale's sociology work at Iowa 
State where they learned how the process of how new

10:45.934 --> 11:00.910
ideas are accepted, they call it the fusion 
process, of when people first hear about a new

10:45.934 --> 11:00.910
idea. how they go about the mental processes they 
go through, and finally accepting a new variety of

11:01.396 --> 11:10.006
corn or a new way of doing things or something. We 
were given training.

11:20.039 --> 11:27.808
Three of us were selected to participate in an 
intensive three-week program at the University

11:20.039 --> 11:27.808
of Wyoming. And then we came back, and we had to 
train everybody in the staff, all 1,100, 1,200

11:28.447 --> 11:51.990
people that were on the staff about that time in 
district meetings, different kinds of state

11:28.447 --> 11:51.990
meetings, two or three day, I guess, meetings 
where we gave everybody this

11:28.447 --> 11:51.990
type of training. interpersonal relations and 
communications and how you get ideas across to

11:53.253 --> 11:59.519
people and get them to accept them and all this type 
of thing. That was a very exciting project. As I

12:02.522 --> 12:04.704
said, I was involved in special things. Back in the 
county, I had already gotten extremely

12:05.405 --> 12:20.560
frustrated with the lack of any guidance in terms 
of how files were kept in the counties because the

12:05.405 --> 12:20.560
county agents had to depository of all kinds of 
information. And you had a real problem. Every

12:23.387 --> 12:27.151
county agent set up their own system, and no two 
people think. And I guess part of that was my

12:28.052 --> 12:30.215
library experience. I knew that you could 
organize things. And so I started out in the county

12:33.058 --> 12:35.160
of trying. At that time, I had worked in the library 
here. I had to do a decimal system. I thought, well,

12:39.926 --> 12:44.351
why can't you use the same principles, maybe in 
organizing office files? But I found out that that

12:44.431 --> 12:48.876
was a little too complicated for the average 
agent. So I started on my own in the county of

12:49.278 --> 12:53.362
developing a sort of a filing system. And my 
contention was that if there was a similar filing

12:54.403 --> 13:19.048
system in every county, that when agents went from 
one county to the other, they would either face one

12:54.403 --> 13:19.048
problem of learning the other guy's or his 
predecessor's system, which probably was

12:54.403 --> 13:19.048
incomprehensible, or set up his own, which was a 
very huge process because in most counties you had

13:20.041 --> 13:24.988
five or six, ten file cabinets full of 
information. I mean, you had to have, you know,

13:25.048 --> 13:30.015
somebody come in, what's the formula for a 
whitewashing offense? I mean, you don't remember

13:30.135 --> 13:34.181
these things, you have to have a place to find this 
information. And so I, so it had been tried before

13:35.183 --> 13:41.412
three or three times in Texas and always bogged 
down. It had been tried in other states, it had been

13:41.492 --> 13:46.339
tried nationally, and I said, I think I can do it. 
And I was given full time off and resources to do it,

13:49.471 --> 13:58.200
and I developed this system in about a year's time, 
but I involved everybody in the staff, every

13:49.471 --> 13:58.200
specialist. We set up the sections by 
disciplines, animal science, but we did it as an

13:59.081 --> 14:05.627
agent would look at it. You know, he wouldn't look 
at it in terms of, you know, breeding and so forth,

14:05.848 --> 14:12.755
but he would look at it from the way he does it. So we 
set up a rather elaborate filing system, and we

14:13.275 --> 14:18.060
went We trained, gave people, everybody in the 
state, a full day training program on it, and even

14:18.344 --> 14:28.454
provided the materials of the dividers, the 
guidance, and so forth. So that was a very, I

14:28.914 --> 14:35.221
thought it was a thing that made a great 
contribution to the organization. And as far as I

14:35.341 --> 14:38.644
know, the system is still being utilized. So I was 
kind of jumping from projects to projects. And

14:44.650 --> 14:46.832
gradually, I was beginning. what I'd call more 
real administrative responsibilities.

14:53.041 --> 14:56.485
When you started out, did you replace anybody? No, 
no, I think it was more of a new slot for special

14:56.846 --> 15:02.914
projects, I guess you'd call it. But gradually I 
was given responsibility over units of other

15:03.975 --> 15:14.389
people, like in that period of time, community 
development became a big new thrust from the

15:14.555 --> 15:37.997
Lyndon Johnson, you know, working with 
low-income farmers and so forth, and I started

15:14.555 --> 15:37.997
giving leadership to some of those kind of 
programs, or had the people that were employed in

15:14.555 --> 15:37.997
those areas, and got involved in, I was always 
available for special things, the Century Study,

15:14.555 --> 15:37.997
I got stuck in that. That was in the 60s. Mr. Rutter 
was, early on, was president of both the campus and

15:41.274 --> 15:46.783
the system. So Dr. Hutchinson, no, Hutchinson, 
isn't it? Hutchinson. H-U-T-C-H-I-S-O-N?

15:56.359 --> 15:56.700
Hutchinson, yeah. All right. He reported to 
President Rutter that, the what was Mr. Rudder's

16:03.520 --> 16:11.048
what was their working relationship and how do you 
think he felt about the extension service Rudder?

16:12.910 --> 16:14.452
Did they did they work well together? I think so I 
mean I think so Mr. Rudder had a good understanding

16:17.075 --> 16:28.487
of rural agricultural I mean he had that 
background himself I think he recognized the

16:17.075 --> 16:28.487
important role that the extension service played 
particularly in the 90 percent of the counties in

16:31.285 --> 16:57.965
of thing, and I think he recognized, which I always 
say, land grant, I have made the statement at land

16:31.285 --> 16:57.965
grant meetings that, you know, you get a lot of 
people that come out of non-land grant situations

16:31.285 --> 16:57.965
that get into leadership positions, and I always 
say that presidents of non-land grant

16:31.285 --> 16:57.965
universities would give their right arm to have 
what a land grant university president has with

16:31.285 --> 16:57.965
this outreach into every single community. I 
think a lot of presidents that don't have that

17:01.103 --> 17:06.591
appreciation don't realize what they have with 
the extension service. And I think Mr. Rudder

17:07.192 --> 17:18.309
understood that, and I think he used the extension 
service for... Can you think of any examples where

17:07.192 --> 17:18.309
he demonstrated how well he could relate to 
agricultural people? Mr. Rudder? Yeah, places

17:19.451 --> 17:23.437
where he used to... Well, he was always at home in 
agricultural circles. I mean, he had no

17:23.457 --> 17:26.942
problem... Well, I guess he was at home in all kinds 
of circles, but You know, he did grow up in a rural

17:27.783 --> 17:32.389
area and understood farmers and farmers' 
problems. I don't think he was a farmer himself,

17:32.849 --> 17:34.732
was he? I think they had... They had a ranch. They 
did have a ranch, but they had business that served

17:37.956 --> 17:40.439
farmers. Yeah, yeah. But he had a good 
understanding of, I think, farm problems and I

17:42.862 --> 17:49.690
think supported the Extension Service very well, 
and as far as I know, at least from my vantage point,

17:50.851 --> 17:56.478
there were no problems in terms of relationships 
and so forth. Would you agree with me? I think that

17:57.719 --> 18:09.953
he felt more relaxed and comfortable in front of an 
agricultural group than he did in front of a

17:57.719 --> 18:09.953
faculty group. Yeah, I'd say that's probably a 
fair assessment. There was a lot of, I guess,

18:13.117 --> 18:20.065
unhappiness that I detected during the century 
study and so forth, particularly from people who

18:20.770 --> 18:29.941
At about that time, I would guess in engineering 
and agriculture that 80% of the faculty were A&M

18:20.770 --> 18:29.941
graduates themselves. Of course, then the 
decision was made to try to get more outside, which

18:30.341 --> 18:36.989
was necessary if the school was going to grow. But I 
think there was a lot of resentment on the pure

18:37.890 --> 18:46.120
academics that he had no academic credentials as 
such. Now, as far as I remember, the Century Study

18:46.758 --> 18:55.926
is 62-3-4, and you were appointed to the 
committee, weren't you? They had four task

18:56.186 --> 18:59.869
forces. I worked with one of the task forces. 
That's what I thought. The chairman I worked with

19:03.993 --> 19:09.697
was Harry Moore, and they had 25. Describe what you 
can remember of that task force's work. Describe

19:14.221 --> 19:16.343
what that task force did. Well, it was a very 
interesting experience. I mean, these were the

19:18.653 --> 19:27.987
very top people in Texas, political, industrial, 
business, agricultural, you name it, top

19:18.653 --> 19:27.987
leaders, men and women. all parts of the state. It 
was interesting to see how they interacted and

19:30.446 --> 19:35.174
became a group and made their recommendation. I 
think each task force has sort of an area to look at.

19:38.860 --> 19:43.027
And the staff person was kind of the go-for. You 
know, made arrangements for the meetings and got

19:43.648 --> 19:49.738
the resource people they needed, kept notes of the 
meeting and wrote up their materials, which were

19:50.005 --> 19:55.632
turned into your group, I guess, and processed 
them somehow. I don't remember all the details,

19:56.333 --> 19:59.277
but it was an interesting experience. Do you think 
that was an important activity in terms of its

19:59.297 --> 20:03.943
long-range results? It was absolutely 
essential. A&M would not have been anywhere from

20:05.305 --> 20:19.624
my viewpoint where they are today, because the 
report dealt with the basic issues about

20:05.305 --> 20:19.624
co-education, mandatory core thing, name 
change, all of those things, as I think we

20:20.414 --> 20:25.639
indicated before. My own conclusion is nobody 
could have done this other than Earl Rudder,

20:26.880 --> 20:36.010
because he did have a non-academic background, 
but he knew that he had to have the state

20:26.880 --> 20:36.010
leadership. If the state leadership made these 
recommendations, that they would be more

20:37.051 --> 20:42.996
acceptable, and I think it turned out that way. Do 
you remember any opinions Dr. Hutchinson had

20:43.297 --> 20:48.582
about some of those basic changes?

20:51.380 --> 20:55.484
Well, he didn't, I mean, he didn't, deliberately 
didn't try to influence me. I was just pretty much,

20:55.544 --> 20:58.887
I guess that was almost a full-time assignment 
those days. Almost. I mean, I didn't. Like, I never

21:01.249 --> 21:04.151
heard of his being for or against. No, I think he was 
a true blue Aggie, and I think he had to, but he was

21:04.191 --> 21:11.537
also progressive. He'd gone to the University of 
Chicago and got his Ph.D. I mean, I think he

21:14.880 --> 21:20.205
recognized that some of the change, but he tended 
to be, you know, conservative, uh, I know he had a

21:20.641 --> 21:28.373
real problem, and I told my wife the other day, I 
think if it hadn't been for me, he would have got

21:20.641 --> 21:28.373
himself in trouble. He was a hard time accepting 
women wearing pants. Really? Describe that,

21:35.183 --> 21:37.346
because that's good history. Well, there was a 
period there when women started wearing what are

21:37.406 --> 21:44.237
called pantsuits, something like that, and he was 
just adamantly against it. He just thought it was

21:44.257 --> 21:48.403
not professionally appropriate, and I I guess I 
was a little of the younger generation, and I told

21:49.075 --> 21:54.403
him, don't waste your shots on it. It's a fashion 
thing. It's probably come and go. But he had a real

21:57.267 --> 22:00.532
hard time accepting it. You see, if you go back far 
enough in time, I mean, that generation, it was

22:00.973 --> 22:06.361
like school teaching. A woman couldn't teach if 
she was married, for example, or divorced or

22:06.641 --> 22:12.510
something like that. It was a different area. I 
think he had also... more conservative

22:16.278 --> 22:19.322
viewpoints about the racial thing. I mean, I'm 
sure that he felt the way the system had arranged

22:19.382 --> 22:31.317
it, and I think it was from a sincere basis that he 
felt the black community was better served with

22:19.382 --> 22:31.317
having their own professionals. They could 
relate to each other, and there's some evidence

22:31.998 --> 22:34.381
that's true. I mean, even now they try to identify 
people. There was one other thing I got very

22:39.187 --> 22:44.293
involved in that I'm very proud of that's, I guess, 
made my reputation a little more national is that I

22:44.594 --> 22:52.924
participated with the federal office. They had a 
small research unit at the Department of

22:52.964 --> 22:58.050
Agriculture in Washington, only a handful of 
people. But in the war and poverty time days, some

22:59.172 --> 23:05.940
monies became available for extra studies. We 
were very concerned that we, with our home

23:06.821 --> 23:12.087
economics program, particularly in nutrition, 
that we weren't you know, really reaching people

23:13.518 --> 23:17.305
effectively, the poorest of the poor. And this is 
very unusual for Extension to get involved that

23:18.507 --> 23:37.922
deeply, but there was a lady who was a research 
expert out of Washington, and if you look at my

23:18.507 --> 23:37.922
resume, that's identified on there as a 
publication that Dr. Starley Hunter and I did a

23:18.507 --> 23:37.922
long-term project In the Hispanic area of El Paso,

23:38.662 --> 23:52.576
what was unusual about it, in this type of a thing, 
we actually had a control group. It's called

23:52.817 --> 23:55.800
Reaching Mexican-American Families. We 
actually had about an area of 700, 800 families,

23:55.820 --> 24:04.028
another area that demographically, 
statistically, was similar. We didn't do any work

24:06.154 --> 24:09.618
with this group, but we worked with the other 
group. And well, to make a long story short, we

24:09.638 --> 24:33.711
found out that we could utilize what we call 
paraprofessionals, people out of that

24:09.638 --> 24:33.711
community, homemakers, mothers, bring them in 
and employ them at minimum wage, give them

24:09.638 --> 24:33.711
intensive training in nutrition, human 
nutrition, and let them go back out in the

24:09.638 --> 24:33.711
communities and that they could get access to the 
homes where a professional could not. And we found

24:37.865 --> 24:51.906
that, and it was a seven-year project, we found 
that using this technique was an effective way of

24:37.865 --> 24:51.906
reaching this audience. They actually improved

24:51.926 --> 25:01.740
in their knowledge of nutrition and made some 
changes in their practices We had identified one

25:02.007 --> 25:23.458
of the problems was that as much of the population 
was in a migratory status that had come from

25:02.007 --> 25:23.458
Mexico, what we found particularly with the 
succeeding generations is that they brought the

25:02.007 --> 25:23.458
best of both cultures and pick up the worst, I mean 
fast food, potato chip, protein. If you analyze

25:23.995 --> 25:32.025
their own diets the way they were in the 
traditional days, they were probably pretty good

25:23.995 --> 25:32.025
in terms of the beans. And anyway, we identified 
that this could be done with low-income

25:32.926 --> 25:40.155
audiences. And this gave rise to a program, I don't 
know if you've heard about, you probably did if you

25:41.237 --> 25:53.412
were president, of the Expanded Food and 
Nutrition Educational Program, which was

25:41.237 --> 25:53.412
financed in the Johnson war and poverty days. I 
guess it even started out, I guess, even the

25:55.942 --> 26:00.947
Kennedy times, but money started becoming 
available. And the Department of Agriculture was

26:01.587 --> 26:12.617
given special monies by Congress to carry out a 
nationwide program of reaching the poorest of the

26:01.587 --> 26:12.617
poor with a nutrition program. And it was based on 
the results. And that program continues to this

26:15.120 --> 26:18.983
day, although it has not been funded. Its funding 
has diminished. We, the basic unit in Texas, every

26:21.556 --> 26:27.502
state was given the money but could operate the 
program. But it was based on the principles that we

26:27.542 --> 26:39.934
had identified of employing paraprofessionals, 
giving them intensive training, even though they

26:27.542 --> 26:39.934
may have only had little or no formal education 
themselves. But they were given very simple

26:39.974 --> 26:48.081
materials, recipes to get into the homes and try to 
get families to. There was no money given. It also,

26:50.125 --> 27:03.947
but these people were given information about 
when they found problems, they went house to

26:50.125 --> 27:03.947
house, or what they were encouraged to do is to get 
two or three or four of their neighbors together

26:50.125 --> 27:03.947
and talk about these things. But they were also 
given information about the other social

27:05.229 --> 27:13.863
services that were available for families, food 
stamps later on and all this type of thing. And a lot

27:14.383 --> 27:16.707
of these people were unaware, a lot of these people 
were totally afraid of government or anything.

27:19.362 --> 27:21.184
These people were not even identified as 
government. They were just neighbors helping

27:21.204 --> 27:22.786
you. And I think it was a successful program. And as 
I said, I think it's, as I said, this research that

27:26.470 --> 27:36.882
we participated in, it was a difficult thing to do 
because you had to train people to do it. You had to

27:36.922 --> 27:46.052
get detailed information about what they, when we 
started the project, we went into the

27:36.922 --> 27:46.052
experimental area and actually found out the base 
of knowledge. people had about nutrition. Then we

27:48.765 --> 27:54.131
conducted the program and measured it two years 
later, and then again seven years later as to the

27:48.765 --> 27:54.131
actual changes. Did the same thing with the 
control group. It was an interesting project, but

27:56.774 --> 28:05.525
as I said, it was one of the bases used for this 
national program that Congress funded and still

27:56.774 --> 28:05.525
continues to fund. In fact, that program, I was, 
the basic unit in Texas, which I was given sort of,

28:05.985 --> 28:14.976
even though it was a home economics area, it was 
given the responsibility of the training, the

28:15.530 --> 28:22.939
intellectual support of the training materials 
and so forth. The home economics staff, of course,

28:22.959 --> 28:28.086
the nutritionists were involved in the nutrition 
training of it. And what we did, we set up only in

28:29.527 --> 28:41.402
urban areas and a few rural areas what we call an 
expanded foods and nutrition unit, which

28:29.527 --> 28:41.402
included 30 paraprofessionals. which was too 
money for one professional to supervise. So we had

28:44.868 --> 28:55.040
an intermediate group called program

28:44.868 --> 28:55.040
aides, who were also people of that community. But 
they worked full time, were paid full time. And one

28:58.264 --> 28:59.065
professional. So a unit consisted of 30 people, 
mostly women in most cases, homemakers

28:59.085 --> 29:06.934
themselves, who were employed. to reach out to 
their neighbors and friends on this program. You

29:12.857 --> 29:15.540
had a program aide who supervised 10 of those. You 
had to schedule things pretty carefully. You do

29:19.405 --> 29:22.108
this block and this type of thing. They were 
trained every week, given a half a day of training

29:22.128 --> 29:25.272
every week. And then you had one professional 
nutritionist who supervised the whole program.

29:29.637 --> 29:36.145
This led to, talking about the growth of 
bureaucracy, I once was at a land grant meeting.

29:37.036 --> 30:02.082
some Californian you know they have the huge 
counties out there bragging about the size of

29:37.036 --> 30:02.082
their staffs and I said well I can I think I can top 
your story I said we have one county where we have

29:37.036 --> 30:02.082
over 100 employees he was absolutely staggered 
and it became I could actually in San Antonio we set

29:37.036 --> 30:02.082
up there's only city we set up two units if you're 
familiar with San Antonio they have both the

30:14.161 --> 30:17.424
So that was 34 times two. And then we got a Sears 
funding project for doing work with low-income

30:18.525 --> 30:27.174
youth, a 4-H program. And they hired part-time 
paraprofessionals, about 30 or 40 of those. So you

30:32.199 --> 30:37.123
add all those together, not even counting the 
professional staff at one time. We had over 100

30:37.143 --> 30:40.326
people working in one county alone. But this was 
mostly either federal money or

30:48.839 --> 30:52.373
trying to reach low-income families. We need to 
quit, because you go to 10 o'clock. Aren't we about

30:55.184 --> 30:56.790
through?
