00:01.280 --> 00:03.742
Dr. F. P. Jaggi. Today's date is January 24th, 
1980, and this is Terry Anderson.

00:14.233 --> 00:20.679
Today's interview is with Dr. Frederick P. Jaggi, 
Jr., retired professor of Veterinary Medicine.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.861
Today's date is January 24th, 1980. Now,

00:22.881 --> 00:30.949
you were born on May 5th of 1900 in Mexico, and you 
attended high school in San Antonio. Could you

00:33.427 --> 00:37.471
tell us about your experiences in high school? 
Well, I didn't have any particular experiences in

00:38.752 --> 00:46.479
high school that were different from most of the 
other boys in high school. Oh, we participated in

00:47.741 --> 00:59.552
sports of one kind and another, and then the usual 
academic

00:47.741 --> 00:59.552
courses that everybody took, But beyond that, I 
had no particular activities.

01:07.146 --> 01:14.316
In other words, lots of the boys went in for 
debating societies and all that. I did not have

01:15.117 --> 01:18.781
time for that because I worked after school. What 
kind of work did you do? Delivering shoes for a shoe

01:21.625 --> 01:25.590
company there.

01:30.447 --> 01:32.610
You were born in Mexico. That's right. How'd you 
get up to San Antonio, and could you tell us about

01:33.632 --> 01:37.959
your parents' background?

01:41.845 --> 01:43.167
Well, how far back you want to go? Well, go ahead, go 
ahead. My mother and father were from Eagle Pass

01:46.993 --> 01:57.990
originally, and then my father went to Mexico 
working for mining companies, and then I was born

01:59.506 --> 02:03.109
in Pachuca, Mexico, the state of Hidalgo. And my 
father was, well, they called him a mining

02:04.511 --> 02:10.877
engineer. Pachuca was, at that time, was the 
biggest silver mining center in the world, I

02:12.579 --> 02:19.726
guess. And

02:21.768 --> 02:26.152
I was born there. We left there and went to Mexico 
City. Let me just say you were wondering about my

02:29.763 --> 02:34.449
education. I started out with a governess. There 
was four of us children, and we had a governess then

02:37.393 --> 02:43.060
for one year. After that, I went to the Methodist 
Mission School there in Pachuca. And when the

02:51.752 --> 02:56.698
Madero Revolution took over, the town in 1911. We 
moved to Mexico City and I went to the American

02:58.685 --> 03:02.851
school there. And we stayed there till, well, the 
end of the summer of 1912 when we moved to San

03:05.334 --> 03:14.006
Antonio. Then I went through the San Antonio 
schools. Now did your father have an engineering

03:17.291 --> 03:20.215
degree? No. Could you tell me about his education? 
No, I can't. All I know is Well he went to St. Mary's

03:26.311 --> 03:39.832
School in San Antonio, I know that, or University 
or whatever it was, which is still there, and

03:26.311 --> 03:39.832
beyond that I can't tell you anything about his 
education. Did he work for a company or did he work

03:40.212 --> 03:43.437
for the Mexican government? Yes, he worked for a 
company. Now you were down in Mexico at a rather

03:47.103 --> 03:50.648
turbulent time. Do you, I know you're only 11 or 12 
years old at this time, but do you remember

03:51.286 --> 03:59.118
anything, any episodes during the Mexican 
Revolution? Well, I remember when the, when the

03:59.498 --> 04:19.588
Madarizas took over the town of Pachuca, they came 
in and shot it up and burnt some of the buildings and

03:59.498 --> 04:19.588
the, I guess you'd call it the National Guard or 
Army, whatever it was, It's a little different

04:20.210 --> 04:29.845
from our system in that each state more or less 
operated independently. At any rate, there was a

04:29.925 --> 04:36.435
barracks there with soldiers, and they just took 
out. They left. And after two or three days while

04:38.658 --> 04:46.690
the Maderistas established Oh, some sort of 
semblance of order there. They executed a man

04:51.014 --> 04:56.479
which I visited, which I viewed. I shouldn't say 
visited, I viewed it. I'm glad I didn't visit it.

05:01.524 --> 05:02.946
They shot him? Yes, they shot him. He was a 
bureaucrat on the other side? Well, no, they got

05:07.750 --> 05:15.478
him for, oh, you might call it vandalizing or 
looting. because all the workmen, the peons and

05:16.589 --> 05:36.830
all those, when the maderistas started into town, 
they just became a mob and did a lot of looting, and

05:16.589 --> 05:36.830
they're the ones who burned the buildings that 
were burned and that sort of thing.

05:39.713 --> 05:41.635
The governor, of course, took out because this was 
a different regime, and they finally

05:43.943 --> 05:53.919
straightened things out. It didn't last too long, 
that is the disorder, and then it went on from

05:53.939 --> 06:08.241
there, and we went to Mexico City, and Madero was 
president then. Diaz had been. He overthrew

06:12.715 --> 06:27.754
Madero overthrew Diaz, and then he became 
president and was in Mexico City during the time

06:12.715 --> 06:27.754
that we were living there, and beyond that I can't 
tell you anything about there. This is a time of

06:28.875 --> 06:32.360
rather intense nationalism for the Mexicans. Was 
there any anti-Americanism that you can remember

06:32.780 --> 06:35.984
at that time? Oh yes, there was some. There's 
always been antagonism to Americans. Americans

06:40.373 --> 06:46.519
have the peculiar habit of not understanding 
foreigners. They think they should all behave and

06:47.260 --> 06:59.572
act like Americans, and well, the Americans seem 
to feel like they're a little superior. So there's

07:00.453 --> 07:02.375
always a resentment there. And yes, there were 
some anti-American demonstrations

07:11.035 --> 07:14.319
Not bad, but your family? No, no, our family was 
not, no. Okay, let's move north then, back up to San

07:18.003 --> 07:22.989
Antonio. What were the subjects that you liked the 
most when you were in high school?

07:30.238 --> 07:33.061
I didn't particularly care too much for any of the 
subjects. I guess mechanical drawing and shop

07:34.082 --> 07:40.570
work, things of that nature were my principal 
interests. I never was a whiz at mathematics or

07:43.557 --> 07:50.606
ancient history or any of that stuff. I shouldn't 
call it stuff, but those courses, and

07:50.626 --> 08:01.641
well I did like I think probably botany. We didn't 
have zoology, but we did have botany and we had an

08:03.884 --> 08:09.932
excellent teacher, and I liked that. It was very 
interesting. How large was the school? How many

08:17.876 --> 08:18.597
students?

08:22.361 --> 08:25.525
Oh, there was only one high school in San Antonio at 
that time. That was Old Main Avenue High School,

08:25.565 --> 08:33.154
and I imagine there was about 2,000 in the high 
school.

08:36.518 --> 08:38.080
I understand they must have seven or eight high 
schools there now. Yeah, yeah. Now a rather

08:42.055 --> 08:45.920
interesting world event was exploding at this 
time. World War I, 1914, erupts in Europe, and then

08:45.960 --> 08:55.412
we joined the war in 1917, and you're 17 years old at 
that time. Do you remember what it was, if the war

08:56.654 --> 09:03.863
itself had much of an impact on high school, or 
right after you got out of high school? Not so much

09:05.445 --> 09:08.269
impact on high school, It did. The people, of 
course, reacted to it. And then in the summer, I

09:15.904 --> 09:32.425
guess it was, of 1918,

09:15.904 --> 09:32.425
three of us went up to work in the wheat harvest, 
which was

09:15.904 --> 09:32.425
popular at that time. They were short of hands, and 
we went up through Kansas and South Dakota working

09:32.445 --> 09:39.454
in the wheat harvest. On the way back, I had, I guess 
I was 18 then, and I registered for the draft in

09:40.987 --> 09:51.243
Amarillo on the way home. But beyond that, it did 
not affect us a whole lot. We had lots of soldiers

09:57.493 --> 10:07.990
there in San Antonio, and Fort Sam Houston, Camp 
Trev, Kelly Field, and all that, and

10:10.619 --> 10:12.302
Oh, we played a lot of them football.

10:15.707 --> 10:24.820
We didn't get very far with them, but nevertheless 
we did play them, and some of their people from time

10:15.707 --> 10:24.820
to time coached us. That is the high school team. 
Pretty good relations between the high school

10:29.287 --> 10:33.113
kids and the servicemen? Oh yes, yes. Good, good 
relations as far as I can far as I was concerned, we

10:39.712 --> 10:52.973
had good relations, and I don't remember any 
disagreeableness between any of the students and

10:39.712 --> 10:52.973
any of the service people.

10:53.053 --> 11:06.073
Southern Texas is heavily influenced by German 
immigration a century ago, and I was, I'm sure that

10:53.053 --> 11:06.073
one of the languages in high school was German at 
this time, and in many high schools across the

11:06.425 --> 11:13.992
country during World War I they banned the 
instruction of German language. Do you remember

11:14.032 --> 11:16.194
if they did that at San Antonio? We didn't have 
German in the high school. We had Spanish. Spanish

11:20.278 --> 11:21.159
and Latin. And in the grade schools before the war 
they had, in some of the schools they had German,

11:22.200 --> 11:31.549
and in some of them they had Spanish.

11:35.292 --> 11:35.993
But They didn't have German in high school. Now why 
exactly did you go up to the Midwest to help with the

11:41.109 --> 11:49.378
grain harvest? Well, I had to do something for the 
summer. It seemed adventuresome, and we got us an

11:53.261 --> 12:03.111
old Model T Ford three of us, and we and we took off. 
We got 50 cents an hour working in- Fifty cents an

12:07.919 --> 12:11.965
hour? Yeah, big money. That is pretty good. So 
working in the harvest and we'd stay in one place

12:15.811 --> 12:28.812
until that was harvested out and then we'd move on 
north to places that were just starting up and

12:31.441 --> 12:35.288
Oh, we did too much exploring, I guess, to make much 
money. We wanted to see this and that and the Black

12:35.969 --> 12:43.182
Hills and Montana, Wyoming. So we spent most of our 
money just traveling around, looking at things,

12:44.204 --> 12:53.280
and then we'd run out of money and then we'd go back 
to work somewhere. 50 cents an hour seems pretty

12:53.868 --> 13:03.437
good for 1917, considering that it wasn't until 
1937 when we get the first minimum wage, and that's

12:53.868 --> 13:03.437
only 25 cents an hour. Well, this was set by the 
government. Really? And in order to get workers, I

13:08.101 --> 13:17.930
think at first it was 45 cents, and then they went to 
50 cents an hour. And, of course, you've got your

13:19.271 --> 13:22.054
room and board. Yeah. on these farms. The rooms 
were usually questionable, but the food was all

13:25.047 --> 13:31.414
right. Lots of it. We usually slept right on the 
ground in our own blankets rather than go into

13:35.758 --> 13:51.094
those places where all the granaries and places 
that stick you to sleep. Were you drafted during

13:53.116 --> 13:54.818
the war? No, the war ended before I got out of high 
school. Oh, I thought you graduated in the summer

14:01.126 --> 14:04.710
of 1918. Did you? No. From high school? No, in 
January of 1919. Oh, okay, then the war just ended.

14:20.150 --> 14:20.490
Okay. But you registered during the summer of 1918 
and you did register? Yeah, in Amarillo on the way

14:27.795 --> 14:29.757
home. And then that winter I graduated from high 
school. Oh, okay. I thought you probably

14:35.564 --> 14:37.286
graduated in June. No. No, I didn't graduate in 
June. Why not? Well,

14:44.414 --> 14:51.743
my education had lots of ups and downs. See, I was in 
the school in Pachuca when the Motheristas took

14:52.938 --> 14:57.124
the place over. And that was along in May, I guess it 
was. And they closed the school down, so there's no

15:03.893 --> 15:07.599
grades. Then I went to Mexico City, and they stuck 
me in the grade there, fourth grade, I guess it was.

15:18.554 --> 15:22.219
And it was a tough school.

15:23.414 --> 15:24.435
It was right up there. Then we came to San Antonio, 
and the grades were divided. And they put me in the

15:31.746 --> 15:38.495
high fifth, I think it was. So that was in 
September. So I didn't start with the low fifth. I

15:44.925 --> 15:46.086
started the high fifth. Then in the midterm, I went 
over to the next grade. And so I was all messed up

15:52.827 --> 15:56.613
that way. So you were half a year behind? Yeah, half 
a year behind or half a year ahead, whichever way

15:58.316 --> 16:03.564
you want to look at it. Depends on which school you 
were looking at. Why'd you decide to go on to

16:07.069 --> 16:08.692
college? What else? Well, there's a lot of people 
who don't go to college. Well, my folks wanted me to

16:16.043 --> 16:18.447
go to college. and most of the boys I ran with in high 
school went to college. And so I came to A&M. My

16:32.441 --> 16:44.456
father had drilled it into me that I should be an 
engineer, came to A&M, took a year of engineering,

16:32.441 --> 16:44.456
and found that was not my forte. So then the 
following year, that was a year wasted, I took

16:48.110 --> 16:58.702
agriculture and finished in animal husbandry in 
1924. And that is the class year that I am

17:00.524 --> 17:08.913
associated with, identified with, in the Foreign 
Student Association. And then after I graduated

17:08.933 --> 17:17.863
in animal husbandry, scouting around, there 
wasn't any jobs. except working for Purina, so I

17:19.531 --> 17:36.746
had had some contact with the people in veterinary 
school, so I came back and took veterinary

17:19.531 --> 17:36.746
medicine, an intensive course. Of course, I had 
credit for all the prerequisites, and so it took

17:36.806 --> 17:47.496
me, well, I went Two years, summer and all, took a 
heavy course. I had as many as, I think, 36 hours,

17:55.960 --> 18:03.289
something like that, one term. We'd even have 
night classes. Really? Night classes? Yeah.

18:11.259 --> 18:15.163
Couldn't work it in the schedule, where there were 
so few of us. There were about six in your class? No,

18:18.239 --> 18:19.340
it was only four. Four in your class.

18:27.551 --> 18:34.840
Well, we just shift the things around so that we 
could have enough people to make a class.

18:40.548 --> 18:44.533
Finally, I finished in 1926.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.503
got my degree in veterinary medicine in 1926. Can 
you describe the college campus back in 1920?

18:56.113 --> 19:15.263
Well,

18:56.113 --> 19:15.263
the only dormitories were on the military walk, 
what was called military walk at that time, and

19:18.736 --> 19:20.538
Gine Hall had just been built. It was at the end of 
the military, one end of the military walk and

19:20.699 --> 19:26.547
Spezo Hall was at the other end. And essentially 
everybody except some of what we called the

19:28.349 --> 19:46.174
casuals, men who had been in the service or for some 
reason or other weren't in the Corps, everybody

19:28.349 --> 19:46.174
was in the Corps and on the military walk. And 
that's where we'd have our formations. meal

19:50.528 --> 19:54.392
formations and all that stuff.

19:58.416 --> 20:06.084
Well, let's

19:58.416 --> 20:06.084
go the other way. The front of the campus was at

20:07.125 --> 20:14.312
the railroad tracks where the depot was. Then 
there was a gravel

20:16.054 --> 20:20.198
street up to the Military Walk.

20:26.671 --> 20:31.475
Goodwin Hall on the right, YMCA on the left when you 
got to the end of it.

20:34.438 --> 20:36.440
The President's House was still there. It burnt 
several years ago.

20:42.085 --> 20:44.347
It was down there by Speza Hall.

20:47.790 --> 20:50.893
I might mention this. that they didn't have enough 
dormitories as the enrollment increased some.

21:00.937 --> 21:06.443
When I was there it finally reached 2,000 and a 
little more. And they built some, put up a tent city

21:07.544 --> 21:10.548
out there. Really? A tent city for the corpsmen? 
Yeah. Four men to a tent that was walled up on That's

21:20.928 --> 21:23.751
really what we call temporary housing. And they 
had a bathhouse, a central bathhouse out there,

21:24.171 --> 21:34.281
and they called it Hollywood.

21:39.786 --> 21:48.775
Then in back of the, well the, what we used to call 
the administration building, which know what

21:49.193 --> 21:53.137
they call it now, academic building, the big 
building with the dome.

21:56.500 --> 22:04.509
That was the center of things academically, and 
back of that was the chemistry building, which is

21:56.500 --> 22:04.509
gone. Where the library is now. Yeah, and textual 
engineering was on one side, on the other side.

22:15.259 --> 22:16.821
Then Francis Hall was about a block down from the 
academic building.

22:25.247 --> 22:39.801
Then the end of the campus going towards what is now 
Highway 6 or Texas Avenue was a horse barn, and it

22:25.247 --> 22:39.801
was there about where the administration 
building is.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.947
There are 2,000 students in Yeah, they finally 
made $2,000. There wasn't that many when I was a

22:48.591 --> 22:51.775
freshman, but finally made $2,000. What did you 
think of Core Life? Did it play any role whatsoever

22:54.598 --> 23:00.785
in your decision to come to A&M? Not particularly. 
I guess the cost was one of the big things. A&M was

23:09.875 --> 23:16.002
pretty reasonable at that time, and I guess still 
is, relatively speaking. But it was very

23:17.213 --> 23:28.989
reasonable, and I could go home for $350 and make a 
term.

23:32.854 --> 23:35.097
Room, board, laundry, and all. So that was one of 
the big reasons. Well, there's a lot of different

23:41.025 --> 23:44.790
universities in the state. and some even closer to 
San Antonio, like University of Texas. Why'd you

23:49.863 --> 23:53.106
decide over A&M, over those other ones? Well, I 
don't know that I can really answer that. They did,

24:00.573 --> 24:14.507
I was urged

24:00.573 --> 24:14.507
by some to go to the University of Texas and join a 
fraternity, but I couldn't afford those things.

24:16.934 --> 24:20.438
We just didn't have the money. Now,

24:20.458 --> 24:29.747
in 1924 you started in School of Veterinary 
Medicine. Could you describe the curriculum?

24:34.792 --> 24:44.342
Well, as I say, mine was kind of mixed up because I 
was so irregular, but course anatomy, that was one

24:46.482 --> 25:02.619
of the big things, anatomy and bacteriology, 
pathology, well no that came afterwards,

24:46.482 --> 25:02.619
embryology. Dr. Francis taught the anatomy and 
embryology

25:03.921 --> 25:10.768
and

25:13.837 --> 25:20.906
And as I say, I can't give it to you as freshman year, 
sophomore year, because I was all mixed up. What

25:22.348 --> 25:25.992
about the students? What about your student 
colleagues? Could you tell me about them? Where

25:30.638 --> 25:35.524
they were from, their quality, and what did you 
think of those people? Oh, they were good. Now,

25:38.888 --> 25:43.354
well, Two of them were local boys from around here, 
and they were all smart enough, and made a pretty

25:43.739 --> 26:02.023
good life for themselves afterwards, very 
successful. And then we had a few from here and

26:03.766 --> 26:12.177
there, I can't remember where they were from.

26:13.186 --> 26:15.908
Dr. Burns was in there with us about that time. He 
was from Cuero. He was just a little bit ahead of me,

26:18.471 --> 26:27.139
maybe half a year or something like that, or a year 
maybe. But he was in school with me and a man from

26:29.080 --> 26:34.125
Texarkana, I believe. Just here and there, just 
like all the students are now, just kind of

26:35.206 --> 26:40.110
spotted. Okay, okay. Another question. You said 
that engineering wasn't and animal sciences was

26:43.949 --> 26:52.397
your forte. Why did you decide to continue? Was it 
just because there was only a job with Purina and or

26:55.300 --> 27:06.070
what are the other reasons for you desiring to 
continue and going on to become a doctor of

26:55.300 --> 27:06.070
veterinarian medicine? Well I had contacts with 
it while I was taking agriculture and that phase of

27:11.523 --> 27:27.303
education was much more interesting to me than was 
just agriculture or the agricultural courses.

27:30.367 --> 27:39.218
So I just kind of drifted in and I had lots of good 
friends in the veterinary school There wasn't

27:39.839 --> 27:43.442
many in the veterinary school, but we were good 
friends. Did they have, and if they did, did they

27:43.583 --> 27:49.008
offer you a scholarship or anything like that? Oh, 
I didn't have scholarships. Didn't have

27:51.390 --> 27:52.651
scholarships? No, they didn't have 
scholarships. That was to come later. Okay. Let's

28:01.019 --> 28:04.723
turn to a minute to the instruction. What did you 
think of the quality of instruction in the early

28:05.844 --> 28:09.087
1920s? Oh, it was good. It was excellent. Most of 
the men, in some respects, I guess what they'd

28:14.736 --> 28:22.929
consider now were overworked because they taught 
many courses. Dr. Francis was one of the, I guess,

28:25.172 --> 28:34.247
one of the greatest men I've ever known or had any 
contact with.

28:35.999 --> 28:39.282
Dr. Marsteller was quite outstanding. Dr. 
Leonard over in the hospital.

28:47.231 --> 28:48.913
It seemed Dr. Francis was dean. Marsteller became 
dean later. And well, we had some good men there.

28:57.262 --> 29:05.230
Dr. Price, who taught parasitology and 
histology. and bacteriology, public health.

29:11.679 --> 29:12.740
What a teaching load. He taught all those? Oh, 
yeah. Shoot, all of them. There wasn't but about

29:16.285 --> 29:17.987
six teachers. I know. They had to cover the 
waterfront. Yeah, yeah. I've seen how small the

29:22.874 --> 29:25.898
staff was by looking at . There was Blackberg, S.N. 
Blackberg. He taught physiology and toxicology.

29:39.331 --> 29:40.973
I think that's all he taught.

29:46.659 --> 29:49.502
Now, Price taught immunology. And then

29:50.583 --> 30:07.060
Dr. Leonard and Dr. Marsteller down at the 
hospital, they taught infectious diseases and

29:50.583 --> 30:07.060
surgery and obstetrics.

30:09.689 --> 30:16.282
And all those clinical courses you might call, 
might call them clinical courses. What was the

30:18.466 --> 30:22.213
average number of courses that these gentlemen 
taught?

30:29.547 --> 30:30.769
I'd say about four.

30:35.862 --> 30:37.224
I guess that'd be about right. They didn't leave 
much time for research or anything else, did they?

30:40.288 --> 30:42.090
No, nobody did any research. Now, Dr. Schmidt did 
some research, but he didn't teach. Yeah. Right.

30:52.864 --> 30:55.248
I wonder what the average teaching load is now. 
It's probably two, isn't it? I can't answer that.

31:02.626 --> 31:07.711
I've been going 15 years from out there and I don't 
know what the average load is. I imagine it's about

31:07.771 --> 31:14.559
15 hours, not courses. I probably teach one or two 
courses a semester. It's a trimester now. It's

31:21.906 --> 31:23.448
going back to the semester. Can you tell me who your 
favorite professors were?

31:30.095 --> 31:30.996
They all were. I guess Dr. Francis, Dr. Leonard, 
Dr. Price. Now Dr. Dunn, he just taught some

31:38.989 --> 31:58.654
special courses like poultry diseases,

31:38.989 --> 31:58.654
and I

31:38.989 --> 31:58.654
think that's all he gave us. But you see he was in the

32:00.659 --> 32:17.052
in the laboratory producing whole-collar, 
anti-whole-collar serum and virus, and that was

32:00.659 --> 32:17.052
shipped all over the in the state. So that was
