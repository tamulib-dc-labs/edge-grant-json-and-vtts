00:04.115 --> 00:31.405
I would like to see somebody, an anthropologist, 
really look at this influence of how our legal

00:04.115 --> 00:31.405
system, our judiciary system, our legislative 
system, which is totally related to the nature of

00:04.115 --> 00:31.405
the laws, which government is made of laws, not 
men, I take it, but it nevertheless influences men

00:04.115 --> 00:31.405
and their way of thinking. and there's a there's 
really a tremendously and fundamental

00:33.123 --> 01:01.459
inconsistency between the our system of advocacy 
and science and the manner in which advice

00:33.123 --> 01:01.459
guidance can be exercised of course other 
political systems and i'm just guessing this

00:33.123 --> 01:01.459
napoleonic ones of that nature may not be quite so 
constrained. All sides and all doubts and all

01:04.293 --> 01:14.689
questions and all levels of certainty can be 
discussed more freely in a system of that nature,

01:04.293 --> 01:14.689
perhaps.

01:17.894 --> 01:29.151
So you see science as a sort of an explosive 
institution where everybody puts in sorts of

01:17.894 --> 01:29.151
ideas and argues, and eventually you, in effect, 
would you say calculate risk? Like you say, the

01:29.570 --> 01:39.224
risk of a nuclear plant is 0.2% in terms of doing 
damage, so you ought to go ahead then and do what's

01:29.570 --> 01:39.224
necessary to develop one. Is that fair to say, that 
sort of open debate? I'm not a bit sure how the

01:42.890 --> 01:47.216
nuclear power plant business has gone, really. I 
think that what has happened is that many

01:47.957 --> 01:58.513
companies developed nuclear power plants, and 
they were really looking for patentable aspects

01:47.957 --> 01:58.513
of them so that they could have control of them. I 
know General Atomics had some very excellent

01:58.932 --> 02:03.898
parts of their development. Somehow, all of this 
should be put together in the best parts of all of

02:05.801 --> 02:10.026
these put together, you see. But that hasn't 
happened, I believe. So each company has its

02:15.654 --> 02:18.577
weaknesses and its strengths. What we need is the 
most certain sort of a nuclear power plant. But if

02:22.382 --> 02:26.948
you want to talk about certainty and risk,

02:28.598 --> 02:55.787
and I truly believe that if in the brain of the 
archangel that runs this universe there is some

02:28.598 --> 02:55.787
sort of a curve which says what are the risks to the 
human race and the risks to the human race are not

02:28.598 --> 02:55.787
probably the ones we recognize just exactly like 
the risks in war are very often not the ones we

02:28.598 --> 02:55.787
recognize and that if one really knew what this 
curve looked like and could make the product of

02:56.071 --> 03:06.925
risks and stakes, or on the positive side, risks 
are possibilities and advantages. It's the rare

03:07.766 --> 03:10.750
ones that are going to count, the very rare ones. 
The fact that we can foresee you might have a

03:10.850 --> 03:15.457
nuclear accident is probably a trivial risk 
anyway. If you multiply the stakes times the risk,

03:16.097 --> 03:19.061
it's a very low number.

03:23.006 --> 03:25.690
On the other hand, there are a great number of other 
things that probably are not so. natural events.

03:33.305 --> 03:41.117
And I truly think science's role is to explore 
these more unlikely possibilities. Let's look at

03:42.439 --> 03:45.844
the positive side for an instance. There is no 
science that rules out the existence of a

03:45.864 --> 03:55.339
particle, which is a normal particle that has an 
opposite charge of gravity, just a negative

03:45.864 --> 03:55.339
gravity particle. There's no law that rules such a 
particle out. There is a rule that says if nothing

03:59.463 --> 04:02.447
rules it out, it probably exists. What are the 
possibilities of such a particle existing and

04:03.788 --> 04:08.454
that we could make them? A billion to one? Maybe so. 
But what are the advantages if we could? Rise to an

04:15.083 --> 04:17.646
anti-gravity particle? We'd be in real business 
if it were a normal matter, not nanomatic. We'd

04:23.453 --> 04:24.735
really be in business, wouldn't we? The boon to the 
world would be absolutely incredible. The

04:28.665 --> 04:35.012
product of possibility and value is an immense 
one, even though it's only a billion to one, or

04:28.665 --> 04:35.012
whatever it is. The product is huge. We must 
explore, both on the positive side and the

04:37.855 --> 04:47.105
negative side, these much more outlandish, outre 
possibilities, it seems to me. And we've got to

04:48.026 --> 04:54.773
think, and the anthropologists also, and the 
historians should really think about what are the

04:54.955 --> 05:06.522
The risks and the advantages that are critical to 
the survival of this species, which I take it is one

04:54.955 --> 05:06.522
of our principal concerns.

05:06.542 --> 05:07.564
I don't think we're progressing very well.
