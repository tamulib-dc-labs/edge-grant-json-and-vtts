WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:30.473
Okay. Any time you want to stop or do anything, you just, you just holler at me. Oh, okay. Like you say, we can get it to heck out of the state. We're not worried about that. Okay. No, well, he felt that since Garwood was such a small little town, that we would probably all get a better education if we were sent away to school, and I think my mother concurred once she was, you know, in the small little town. What was her reaction whenever you left to go off to go to school?

00:32.161 --> 00:52.580
Um, just a typical mom sending her child off to school. I mean, she was okay with it, and we were okay with it. So, um, every now and then we'd cry because when we went to St. Mary's Hall and when Paul went to, um,

00:52.580 --> 01:21.233
San Marcos Baptist Academy we were like in the seventh and eighth grade so we were pretty young so there were tears at that point in time but they were both pretty strong and just said you know this is important and you need to do this and we'd get over it we're okay today it was probably very good for you right right did he spend much time counseling you about things or

01:22.988 --> 01:50.174
Yes, both of them did, but he was particularly interesting, and I guess I had the best relationship with him in this way. I could always go to him anytime, anywhere. I could walk into this office and say, I need to talk to you, and he always made time, and I don't care what he was doing, and would close his door or take us into another room in the house, and we'd sit and we'd talk.

01:50.343 --> 02:13.343
That was probably the best thought and memory I have of him, is being able to do that from a little bitty on. Oh yeah, that's great. Is there anything that you want to have in the archive that's in the back of your mind, or either one of you?

02:19.283 --> 02:46.942
You mean as far as included in this? Yeah, just, you know, whatever from the hobbies and things that Caroline and Bill did together. Well, because of her arthritis, she wasn't able to do a lot. She did try fishing, as you can see with him. He loved his deep-sea fishing. He was a quail hunter.

02:47.414 --> 03:10.887
she didn't get much into quail hunting and he was a goose and duck hunter but in his later years he kind of got away from that she spent more of her time um she was a pink lady at the hospital and dar and very involved in the christ episcopal church in eagle lake and

03:10.887 --> 03:39.541
daughter of the king and on the altar guild and that sort of thing. I know at one point in time they tried to get into golf, but they both decided that it took the majority of your day to play around the golf and that just wasn't feasible particularly for him. So she was very, very active then from a social standpoint in organizations. Yeah.

03:40.182 --> 04:06.254
And you said she was a pink lady for how many years? Oh, a number of years at the hospital in Eagle Lake. And then she also volunteered over at the nursing home, too, in Eagle Lake for quite some time. Okay. Was she going to Eagle Lake because there weren't those facilities here? Right.

04:08.009 --> 04:33.794
and their church was in Eagle Lake so we knew quite a few people in Eagle Lake so I think that was the natural place to go she um she also is um if she's been involved in the Magnolia Homes tour in Columbus she has a lot of friends in Columbus they both did now um Jack Wendt and her were friends for a long time is that right

04:34.790 --> 04:58.499
Jack went and my dad were friends. Well, all of them have known each other for years. Yes. And since daddy has passed away, Jack's kind of taken mother under his wing. So he calls and he checks on her and calls me and we chat about her. But yes, very, very good old friends.

04:59.714 --> 05:15.104
Now, did they work together in the rice industry on legislating even water issues? I don't think directly. I'm not real sure. I don't think directly. I think it was more...

05:16.657 --> 05:40.805
Information gathering, if you will. They would both come to each other when they needed to know about this, that, or the other. Networking. Yes, thanks. That's the word. Right. How did he meet Steve Ballas? My father or Jack? Your father.

05:42.965 --> 06:10.488
it might have been through that rice legislative group probably and then daddy served on the hospital board a lot and of course steve has the pharmacy over there but he's involved with the hospital so it might have been through that area too right and steve farms rice for some time did with his hunting and fishing did he

06:11.416 --> 06:31.649
Do that pretty much internationally? I know you went to Australia and you were talking about fishing, but did he hunt around the world or? No. Pretty much in Texas? Just locally, uh huh. Yeah. You said that they had both the Richmond

06:32.662 --> 06:56.962
Irrigation, is it Richmond Irrigation District or? Irrigation Company. It was Richmond Irrigation Company at the time. But he sold that early on then? Right. It just kept the Garwood Irrigation Company. Right. So the two canal systems weren't connected or anything like that? Right. I think one's on the Brazos and the other one was on the Colorado.

06:59.746 --> 07:11.440
Now, one of the things that you mentioned was profit sharing. The profit sharing plan and the credit union. Right.

07:12.588 --> 07:40.398
I'll let Ralph speak to that. Well, he thought a lot of his employees, and what he wanted to always make sure of is, and he even noted that when he sold the Garwood Irrigation Company to LCRA, that you're going to take all the employees and they'll all have a job. And that was one of his key points. If you didn't do that, he wasn't going to sell the company, period. So he wanted to make sure that people were taken care of, not only the rice farmers that are in the area, but he wanted to make sure the employees that have been working with him for years...

07:41.343 --> 08:10.300
And our employee base here, you know, we've had people, we had one guy retire that was here for 50 years. So everyone here, in fact, right now, I mean, I've got probably no one, well, maybe one person less than about five years. Everybody is 10, 15, 20, 25 years. But he was involved with the employees and wanted to help them out as much as possible. So even in his companies, he had a profit-sharing plan

08:11.077 --> 08:25.488
where the employees don't contribute anything. It's basically on the profit of the companies. If the company makes profit, then he contributes X amount to each person's account that works for him in the profit-sharing plan. Plus, he was instrumental in

08:26.483 --> 08:52.572
The companies here have a credit union called a layer interest credit union where you don't see any very many credit unions in this area. People were having a hard time borrowing money from banking institutions at the time, so they established in 1955 a credit union where the employees could actually be a member, save money out of their paychecks, and also come and borrow money.

08:52.572 --> 09:12.502
And we loan from incidentals, washers and dryers, all the way to cars, all the way to making house notes now. So it's an employee-owned credit union, and it's run by the employees, all volunteers. So we have a board of directors,

09:12.923 --> 09:41.560
he he was instrumental in getting all that phase accomplished for the employees too and it does help because garwood doesn't have a bank either so that's kind of like having a bank in town too but it's basically for the employees of the layer interests so you would classify him as really a people-oriented type person then that's right very compassionate in fact i got one of his cards and i've always kept it this is one of his cards

09:42.488 --> 09:57.608
And this is what he had put on the back. When did he have those made? I was thinking about that yesterday. He had me make those, I don't know when, it's been years. Really? Interesting, yeah. Yeah, he was a real...

09:59.600 --> 10:13.842
a giving man he the the people in garwood as far as the fire department the ambulance service i mean he donated a lot towards that uh to keep the ambulance service for the whole community

10:14.045 --> 10:36.860
He was really involved with the fire department as far as making sure that this area was taken care of and still is as of today. He wants that to continue. He felt that it's real important to have a local ambulance service here because it's 20 miles from any town you go to. And he felt that if we could have the volunteers here,

10:37.552 --> 11:03.860
you can get help a lot faster by having your own ambulance service and own fire department. He contributed heavily to that and, you know, that was really important to him. In fact, they just dedicated their little building downtown to him not long ago. But there was another part of him, too.

11:04.501 --> 11:16.432
When was it, Ralph, that some of the people in the community, we were having a very, very cold winter and they weren't capable of paying their electric bills.

11:17.039 --> 11:46.013
Remember that? Well, that and even in the summertime because it was that heat wave. It was a heat wave. That's what it was. That we had here that it was over 100 degrees for, I don't know, a couple of weeks in a row. And there were a lot of people in town that were on the poverty end. And he sent word to them to keep your air conditions and your fans on. And if you couldn't pay your bill to bring them up to him and he'd help them out. And he did.

11:46.013 --> 12:12.963
He ended up helping a lot of people in town that could not allow the elderly, and that's what he was looking for, that needed the air conditioning and all and the heating in the wintertime, to bring him the bill and he'd help you out. And he did, he paid their electric bills, he paid their heating bills. No questions asked, he just did it. And there were a lot of people in the community that

12:12.963 --> 12:28.370
received that help, there were really, I mean, gratitude for that. Oh, yeah. Oh, I bet so. That's very good. And what about their church involvement? Was that pretty extensive also?

12:29.551 --> 12:57.968
Yes, I mean, they always went to Christ Episcopal Church in Eagle Lake. And as I told you about my mother's involvement, he wasn't so involved. I think he did sit on the vestry a couple of times in his younger years. But, I mean, it was an every Sunday sort of deal. Yeah, they were involved. Jane?

12:59.825 --> 13:13.443
I don't know what else to cover. Is this history, is that going to be written or is that something that can be placed in the archive?

13:14.860 --> 13:40.038
No, it's nothing that's actually finished. Nancy, we could maybe take parts of this and give it to you. A lot of it's technical information in there, too. Right. That wouldn't be of interest to you, really. And I think from all these lines and stuff going through here, I think he was editing it and...

13:42.620 --> 14:11.493
gonna like he's got a question mark here and so i just have to probably go through it and gather for you what might you know be of interest sort of a little history yeah i think that's what you're looking for that's right i mean this is what we're really documenting is okay all right that's what we're after okay anything else all right is there anything else that y'all want to add

14:18.800 --> 14:46.525
Well, my mother went to Greenbrier College. You never asked me where she went to college. Are we missing anything? I'm sitting back trying to think. I suppose if we think of something we can

14:46.964 --> 15:15.027
Oh, yeah. Like I said, you'll have an opportunity to get this back and you can add some things to it if you want to or whatever. One thing I think that people should know is my father had an incredible sense of humor and was great at playing jokes on people. Okay. And you saw that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he did do that. And he was... Very quick, very clever.

15:17.575 --> 15:45.723
and so he had a lot of fun I can there are some funny stories of pranks he pulled on people but what was the best one he pulled the best one he pulled was when he he had these lawyers from Houston coming out to the house and both of them

15:46.027 --> 16:13.313
their last names were Hutchison both of well no Hutchison and Grundy I believe anyway they were coming out to go hunting and they had never been out to our house before the one that you've been to um and so he said now he gave them directions and he said now listen you better turn in you better get it right the first time because we have some neighbors

16:13.955 --> 16:42.794
and they don't like being bothered at night and they might shoot at you. And so they were, they were coming, I would say they got to the house about eight or so at night. And so daddy could see their car coming up the gravel road. So he turned all the lights out in the whole house and he got up on that, the roof, the deck up there with a shotgun

16:43.537 --> 17:05.592
and so when they pulled up he started screaming and yelling at them and wanting to know who they were and shooting his gun up in the air and they were flying under the car and finally he couldn't quit laughing long enough to carry it on and he said come on guys it's me just playing a joke on you

17:07.381 --> 17:30.837
I would expect that he probably picked up a lot of that at A&M where he started pulling pranks at A&M. Probably. Those guys were famous for all of that. And that was real entertaining for his children. Oh, I bet it was. I bet so. What do you think was his most significant

17:42.734 --> 17:56.032
Well, before I answer that, the other thing I wanted to tell you that I just remembered is he and my mother for many, many years, if you recall correctly, the state of Texas was predominantly democratic.

17:57.567 --> 18:27.082
and they were very involved with the grassroots Republican Party and worked very hard and went to many conventions and were very dedicated in their effort there so I wanted to tell you that his greatest accomplishment I don't know in his mind I think it was selling the irrigation company the way he did and with the contract that he had behind it and

18:27.740 --> 18:46.707
for the amount of money that he got for it only because he and LCRA had been at odds for a number of years and then to finally come together and both get what they wanted. Wouldn't you say that was... I think that was probably the most, even for the state of Texas, where the water's concerned.

18:48.395 --> 19:16.778
They both felt that they were in a win-win situation. Right. He took care of the farmers in the surrounding communities by the contract that he has with LCRA to supply water for this system at least for the next 10 years. He froze the rates on the water for five years so the farmers could manhandle and help them. He froze the rates for five years in his contract. And he even

19:17.842 --> 19:46.478
he looked after the people here at that point when he was selling that company and as far as there were two things that he wanted to make sure were taken care of in that contract when he sold it he was going to take care of the farmers in the community he was going to take care of the employees and that was the two main concerns in either or if they did not take care of any of those he wouldn't sell it so it wasn't really i mean he did get a lot of money for it don't get me wrong but it wasn't just dollars that

19:46.951 --> 20:16.229
that made him do what he did. Is it okay to talk about his sister? Sure. I understand they were fairly close, is that right? Yes. I guess from, was there an estate then that the two of them had from, is it W.K. then, right? Right. Is that the way he left that to him?

20:16.364 --> 20:45.743
Yes, to the two of them. Did they work pretty close over the years or did Bill pretty much just run everything? Bill ran everything. She was happy just to... She stayed at Eagle Pass and he ran everything from her part of the family. And we still do to this day. Right. It's all still run through here. She's still in Eagle Pass. She just didn't have an interest in...

20:48.427 --> 21:12.372
No, I guess not, and her husband wanted to be in Eagle Pass and do ranching there, and it was, I guess, geographically not, she wasn't capable of staying really that involved. She has a family also, right? Yes, she has three sons. Are they going into ranching also?

21:12.980 --> 21:24.387
uh one of them sort of hits and misses at ranching they have two ranches and he he kind of plays around with one and then his father plays around with the other

21:26.783 --> 21:52.872
Then they have a younger, the youngest is in California, and he is in the music recording business in some fashion. And then the middle son is in Arizona, and he was involved in computers. Do you know what he's doing? I don't know what he's doing now, but he was something in the computer industry at one time.

21:57.074 --> 22:20.277
So you never really got to know her that close since she was out in Eagle Pass? Oh yes, oh yes. I know her very well. I talk to her sometimes twice a day. Nancy knows her probably, she's closer to her than any of the other brothers and sisters. Yeah, she calls Nancy quite a bit.

22:20.277 --> 22:38.975
to find out, too, what's going on here. They come to our annual meetings, but basically, as far as I'm concerned in this area here, we see them like once a year because they're stockholders. I don't know if they visited a lot in the younger years. No, a couple of times a year, probably.

22:39.835 --> 23:08.219
She's very into gardening, though. She loves flowers. And her yard is just gorgeous. She sends me pictures all the time of all the flowers and stuff that she's growing. That's her thing. And her mother was very into gardening, especially roses. And so I think she gets that from her mother. And she had 100% trust in Bill, so she let him handle everything.

23:09.367 --> 23:32.468
I would say that speaks a lot. Not too many people will do that in a court. Well, my father, and I've had many people tell me this, was probably one of the fairest, most honest men they knew. And he was, in my personal opinion, overboard in his fairness to her.

23:33.633 --> 23:58.388
Not that I dislike her, but he was the type of person he would rather be overly so than have someone come back to him and go, well, now, what's this or that? So he always took great care, don't you think, Ralph, in seeing that everything was on the up and up and fair and square.

23:58.777 --> 24:27.818
But did they communicate back and forth pretty regular then, even though they were only here a couple of times a year? Oh, yes. Mm-hmm. All the time, by phone. By telephone. He'd, she'd always call. And he called her. Did, did they ever talk about growing up together, or? About growing up together? Mm-hmm. As kids, and what they did, and things like that? Well, a little bit, I guess.

24:29.202 --> 24:58.548
He'd pull, well he was pulling pranks on her when she was dating. Putting potatoes in exhaust pipes and dates exhaust pipes and I remember when he was little I don't know what prompted her to do this but she shaved off his eyebrows so he had to go around without any eyebrows for a while. So I guess they had a typical

24:58.818 --> 25:24.012
childhood yeah that's great they sound like well they're kind of mischievous oh yeah brothers and sisters that got along but at the time they didn't you know how it goes well everybody has that oh and then they did he and a friend of his somehow wired up her toilet i remember him telling me that

25:25.058 --> 25:53.527
and then they would do something when she'd go to the bathroom and she'd fly and I guess she had a girlfriend over too I guess and it would shock them every time they tried to go to the restroom they wired up the commode seat yeah he did tell me that uh-huh in fact that's why he got into engineering could be mm-hmm what if now what about your uh your granddad um

25:54.083 --> 26:10.503
Did you know him for quite a while then? Oh yes, I was very close to him. He was, well he had a great sense of humor, but he was also a very serious person. He loved to travel.

26:10.807 --> 26:40.608
He was very into genealogy and was putting all that together, and I still have that stuff that I need to go to work on. He was diabetic. He was a very disciplined man because he was insulin dependent and had to watch his diet and had to exercise. So he was disciplined and sort of regimented, if you will. But he didn't let it bother him. He went ahead and did everything he always wanted to do.

26:42.093 --> 27:04.368
There were greenhouses there. Didn't he grow like the greenhouses or was it your grandmother? Well, all the greenhouses were hers. But I do know that he decided, because of the diet that he was on and his travels, he got real into papayas and mangoes. So he was going to figure out how to grow them here.

27:05.448 --> 27:21.631
And actually he did accomplish it. He had these huge things that had plastic and would cover them. He actually successfully grew mangoes and papayas. Very interesting.

27:22.643 --> 27:50.605
Anything he wanted to do, he was going to do it. And that was basically my dad's philosophy too. If they wanted to do it, they were going to find a way to get it done. That's just the way they were. Spent a lot of time thinking about it. Mm-hmm. Oh, my father didn't sleep most of the time because there was something on his mind that he was going to figure out. He wasn't going to ever make a real hasty decision. If you came to him, he thought it through before. If it was something important,

27:51.989 --> 28:13.184
He thought it well through before he ever made the decision to do it. Probably why you're successful at what you're doing. Right. And he did have a tractor dealership here back in the 80s. The fact right here where we're sitting, there were tractors and combines. We had the International and Case dealership here. And back then,

28:14.062 --> 28:41.753
Times were hard, and hardly any new equipment was selling, and he decided to get out of the business. And he did right at, whenever he decided he did it at the right time, because right after that, the bottom fell out of all of the market for new tractors and combines and all. He did it just at the right time. And that was back in the early 80s. I think we got out of that in about 1983.

28:42.293 --> 29:10.272
Now, what about your grandmother? You said she was really heavily involved in gardening? Yes, and she was a big DAR person. I can't remember that much. She traveled quite a bit with him. They both were quite involved in the Methodist Church here locally. In fact, it's now called the Laram Memorial. Laram Memorial United Methodist Church. And what was her name?

29:13.242 --> 29:38.521
Dottie or Dorothy, Dorothy Ann. Now what about your mother's parents? They were from Ohio. He was an engineer for the railroads and so he was gone an awful lot.

29:39.331 --> 29:52.898
And they moved to Weston, West Virginia, which is where my mother was born. And her mother had rheumatoid arthritis. And in fact, was bedridden with it.

29:53.945 --> 30:23.189
most of her life and she developed uh I guess a bladder infection and they were sulfur drugs were just new and out and they put her on sulfur drugs but back then they didn't know to tell them to drink a lot of water so she passed away of uremic poisoning she had a sister an older sister um who did marry and

30:25.433 --> 30:46.544
Was she a Latin teacher? She was very bright. But she was asphyxiated by a gas heater, young in her marriage, in the bathroom. And she didn't have any children. So then her father moved to Circleville, I guess.

30:47.253 --> 31:16.700
And they had a little farm up there and then he finally ended up moving down here with us and staying here for a while prior to his death. So you got to know him pretty good. I did. One of his favorite tricks to do to my mother is evidently working around all these railroad type guys. When they'd run into snakes, they'd pick up these snakes and twirl them in the air and pop their heads off.

31:16.852 --> 31:29.238
My dad used to do that. And so his favorite thing to do to her is when she was having her bridge club in or her DAR ladies over, he'd go and pop the head.
