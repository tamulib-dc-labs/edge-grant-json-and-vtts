WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:02.736
Okay. Any time you want to stop or do anything, you 
just, you just holler at me. Oh, okay. Like you say,

00:06.060 --> 00:07.582
we can get it to heck out of the state. We're not 
worried about that. Okay. No, well, he felt that

00:11.307 --> 00:24.385
since Garwood was such a small little town, that we 
would probably all get a better education if we

00:11.307 --> 00:24.385
were sent away to school, and I think my mother 
concurred once she was, you know, in the small

00:11.307 --> 00:24.385
little town.

00:27.369 --> 00:30.493
What was her reaction whenever you left to go off to 
go to school? Um,

00:32.161 --> 00:39.275
just a typical mom sending her child off to school. 
I mean, she was okay with it, and we were okay with

00:39.315 --> 00:42.781
it. So, um, every now and then we'd cry because when 
we went to St. Mary's Hall and when Paul went to, um,

00:52.580 --> 01:21.253
San Marcos Baptist Academy we were like in the 
seventh and eighth grade so we were pretty young so

00:52.580 --> 01:21.253
there were tears at that point in time but they were 
both pretty strong and just said you know this is

00:52.580 --> 01:21.253
important and you need to do this and we'd get over 
it we're okay today it was probably very good for

00:52.580 --> 01:21.253
you right right did he spend much time counseling 
you about things or Yes, both of them did, but he was

01:22.988 --> 01:31.696
particularly interesting, and I guess I had the 
best relationship with him in this way. I could

01:32.837 --> 01:35.020
always go to him anytime, anywhere. I could walk 
into this office and say, I need to talk to you, and

01:35.100 --> 01:50.194
he always made time, and I don't care what he was 
doing, and would close his door or take us into

01:35.100 --> 01:50.194
another room in the house, and we'd sit and we'd 
talk. That was probably the best thought and

01:50.343 --> 01:57.115
memory I have of him, is being able to do that from a 
little bitty on. Oh yeah, that's great.

02:05.329 --> 02:13.363
Is there anything that you want to have in the 
archive that's in the back of your mind, or either

02:05.329 --> 02:13.363
one of you?

02:19.283 --> 02:22.107
You mean as far as included in this? Yeah, just, you 
know, whatever from the hobbies and things that

02:22.247 --> 02:30.238
Caroline and Bill did together. Well, because of 
her arthritis, she wasn't able to do a lot. She did

02:37.869 --> 02:40.192
try fishing, as you can see with him. He loved his 
deep-sea fishing.

02:45.800 --> 02:46.962
He was a quail hunter. she didn't get much into 
quail hunting and he was a goose and duck hunter but

02:47.414 --> 03:10.907
in his later years he kind of got away from that she 
spent more of her time um she was a pink lady at the

02:47.414 --> 03:10.907
hospital and dar and very involved in the christ 
episcopal church in eagle lake and daughter of the

03:10.887 --> 03:16.133
king and on the altar guild and that sort of thing. I 
know at one point in time they tried to get into

03:16.313 --> 03:28.728
golf, but they both decided that it took the 
majority of your day to play around the golf and

03:16.313 --> 03:28.728
that just wasn't feasible particularly for him. 
So she was very, very active then from a social

03:28.748 --> 03:35.857
standpoint in organizations.

03:39.461 --> 03:39.561
Yeah. And you said she was a pink lady for how many 
years? Oh, a number of years at the hospital in

03:43.286 --> 03:46.189
Eagle Lake. And then she also volunteered over at 
the nursing home, too, in Eagle Lake for quite some

03:48.532 --> 03:56.742
time. Okay. Was she going to Eagle Lake because 
there weren't those facilities here? Right.

04:08.009 --> 04:33.814
and their church was in Eagle Lake so we knew quite a 
few people in Eagle Lake so I think that was the

04:08.009 --> 04:33.814
natural place to go she um she also is um if she's 
been involved in the Magnolia Homes tour in

04:08.009 --> 04:33.814
Columbus she has a lot of friends in Columbus they 
both did now um Jack Wendt and her were friends for a

04:08.009 --> 04:33.814
long time is that right Jack went and my dad were 
friends. Well, all of them have known each other

04:37.814 --> 04:40.557
for years. Yes. And since daddy has passed away, 
Jack's kind of taken mother under his wing. So he

04:50.329 --> 04:55.495
calls and he checks on her and calls me and we chat 
about her. But yes, very, very good old friends.

04:59.714 --> 05:06.147
Now, did they work together in the rice industry on 
legislating even water issues? I don't think

05:06.167 --> 05:09.593
directly. I'm not real sure. I don't think 
directly. I think it was more... Information

05:16.657 --> 05:19.460
gathering, if you will. They would both come to 
each other when they needed to know about this,

05:19.520 --> 05:25.047
that, or the other. Networking. Yes, thanks. 
That's the word. Right. How did he meet Steve

05:31.194 --> 05:36.620
Ballas? My father or Jack? Your father. it might 
have been through that rice legislative group

05:42.965 --> 06:10.508
probably and then daddy served on the hospital 
board a lot and of course steve has the pharmacy

05:42.965 --> 06:10.508
over there but he's involved with the hospital so 
it might have been through that area too right and

05:42.965 --> 06:10.508
steve farms rice for some time did

05:42.965 --> 06:10.508
with his hunting and fishing did he Do that pretty 
much internationally? I know you went to

06:13.419 --> 06:17.386
Australia and you were talking about fishing, but 
did he hunt around the world or? No. Pretty much in

06:18.488 --> 06:19.369
Texas? Just locally, uh huh.

06:26.360 --> 06:26.521
Yeah. You said that they had both the Richmond 
Irrigation, is it Richmond Irrigation District

06:32.662 --> 06:35.907
or? Irrigation Company. It was Richmond 
Irrigation Company at the time. But he sold that

06:41.116 --> 06:42.919
early on then? Right. It just kept the Garwood 
Irrigation Company. Right. So the two canal

06:49.710 --> 06:52.775
systems weren't connected or anything like that? 
Right. I think one's on the Brazos and the other one

06:53.136 --> 06:56.982
was on the Colorado.

06:59.746 --> 07:05.302
Now, one of the things that you mentioned was 
profit sharing. The profit sharing plan and the

07:07.007 --> 07:09.956
credit union. Right. I'll let Ralph speak to that. 
Well, he thought a lot of his employees, and what he

07:14.610 --> 07:26.183
wanted to always make sure of is, and he even noted 
that when he sold the Garwood Irrigation Company

07:14.610 --> 07:26.183
to LCRA, that you're going to take all the 
employees and they'll all have a job. And that was

07:26.643 --> 07:30.627
one of his key points. If you didn't do that, he 
wasn't going to sell the company, period. So he

07:33.130 --> 07:40.418
wanted to make sure that people were taken care of, 
not only the rice farmers that are in the area, but

07:33.130 --> 07:40.418
he wanted to make sure the employees that have been 
working with him for years... And our employee

07:41.343 --> 07:48.772
base here, you know, we've had people, we had one 
guy retire that was here for 50 years. So everyone

07:49.914 --> 07:58.345
here, in fact, right now, I mean, I've got probably 
no one, well, maybe one person less than about five

07:49.914 --> 07:58.345
years. Everybody is 10, 15, 20, 25 years. But he was 
involved with the employees and wanted to help

08:02.690 --> 08:07.376
them out as much as possible. So even in his 
companies, he had a profit-sharing plan where the

08:11.077 --> 08:14.384
employees don't contribute anything. It's 
basically on the profit of the companies. If the

08:16.248 --> 08:23.504
company makes profit, then he contributes X 
amount to each person's account that works for him

08:16.248 --> 08:23.504
in the profit-sharing plan. Plus, he was 
instrumental in The companies here have a credit

08:26.483 --> 08:34.972
union called a layer interest credit union where 
you don't see any very many credit unions in this

08:26.483 --> 08:34.972
area. People were having a hard time borrowing 
money from banking institutions at the time, so

08:36.314 --> 08:52.592
they established in 1955 a credit union where the 
employees could actually be a member, save money

08:36.314 --> 08:52.592
out of their paychecks, and also come and borrow 
money. And we loan from incidentals, washers and

08:52.572 --> 09:01.105
dryers, all the way to cars, all the way to making 
house notes now. So it's an employee-owned credit

09:01.225 --> 09:09.377
union, and it's run by the employees, all 
volunteers. So we have a board of directors, he he

09:12.923 --> 09:41.580
was instrumental in getting all that phase 
accomplished for the employees too and it does

09:12.923 --> 09:41.580
help because garwood doesn't have a bank either so 
that's kind of like having a bank in town too but

09:12.923 --> 09:41.580
it's basically for the employees of the layer 
interests so you would classify him as really a

09:12.923 --> 09:41.580
people-oriented type person then that's right 
very compassionate in fact i got one of his cards

09:12.923 --> 09:41.580
and i've always kept it this is one of his cards And 
this is what he had put on the back. When did he have

09:44.453 --> 09:45.476
those made? I was thinking about that yesterday. 
He had me make those, I don't know when, it's been

09:47.180 --> 09:49.366
years. Really?

09:54.781 --> 09:55.663
Interesting, yeah. Yeah, he was a real...

09:59.600 --> 10:13.862
a giving man he the the people in garwood as far as 
the fire department the ambulance service i mean

09:59.600 --> 10:13.862
he donated a lot towards that uh to keep the 
ambulance service for the whole community He was

10:14.045 --> 10:20.875
really involved with the fire department as far as 
making sure that this area was taken care of and

10:14.045 --> 10:20.875
still is as of today. He wants that to continue. He 
felt that it's real important to have a local

10:23.600 --> 10:33.054
ambulance service here because it's 20 miles from 
any town you go to. And he felt that if we could have

10:34.076 --> 10:36.880
the volunteers here, you can get help a lot faster 
by having your own ambulance service and own fire

10:37.552 --> 10:43.478
department. He contributed heavily to that and, 
you know, that was really important to him. In

10:52.388 --> 11:00.116
fact, they just dedicated their little building 
downtown to him not long ago. But there was another

11:00.617 --> 11:03.880
part of him, too. When was it, Ralph, that some of 
the people in the community, we were having a very,

11:04.501 --> 11:16.452
very cold winter and they weren't capable of 
paying their electric bills. Remember that?

11:17.960 --> 11:22.225
Well, that and even in the summertime because it 
was that heat wave. It was a heat wave. That's what

11:23.106 --> 11:23.667
it was. That we had here that it was over 100 degrees 
for, I don't know, a couple of weeks in a row. And

11:28.192 --> 11:33.939
there were a lot of people in town that were on the 
poverty end. And he sent word to them to keep your

11:34.680 --> 11:40.046
air conditions and your fans on. And if you 
couldn't pay your bill to bring them up to him and

11:40.066 --> 11:44.832
he'd help them out. And he did. He ended up helping a 
lot of people in town that could not allow the

11:46.013 --> 12:00.089
elderly, and that's what he was looking for, that 
needed the air conditioning and all and the

11:46.013 --> 12:00.089
heating in the wintertime, to bring him the bill 
and he'd help you out. And he did, he paid their

12:00.129 --> 12:03.072
electric bills, he paid their heating bills.

12:05.815 --> 12:07.837
No questions asked, he just did it. And there were a 
lot of people in the community that received that

12:12.963 --> 12:17.070
help, there were really, I mean, gratitude for 
that. Oh, yeah. Oh, I bet so. That's very good. And

12:21.618 --> 12:25.144
what about their church involvement? Was that 
pretty extensive also? Yes, I mean, they always

12:29.551 --> 12:34.297
went to Christ Episcopal Church in Eagle Lake. And 
as I told you about my mother's involvement, he

12:35.359 --> 12:42.768
wasn't so involved. I think he did sit on the vestry 
a couple of times in his younger years. But, I mean,

12:48.035 --> 12:51.600
it was an every Sunday sort of deal. Yeah, they were 
involved.

12:57.888 --> 12:57.988
Jane? I don't know what else to cover.

13:05.561 --> 13:13.463
Is this history, is that going to be written or is 
that something that can be placed in the archive?

13:14.860 --> 13:19.367
No, it's nothing that's actually finished. 
Nancy, we could maybe take parts of this and give it

13:19.407 --> 13:24.635
to you. A lot of it's technical information in 
there, too. Right. That wouldn't be of interest to

13:29.642 --> 13:31.986
you, really. And I think from all these lines and 
stuff going through here, I think he was editing it

13:32.807 --> 13:40.058
and...

13:42.620 --> 14:11.513
gonna like he's got a question mark here and so i 
just have to probably go through it and gather for

13:42.620 --> 14:11.513
you what might you know be of interest sort of a 
little history yeah i think that's what you're

13:42.620 --> 14:11.513
looking for that's right i mean this is what we're 
really documenting is okay all right that's what

13:42.620 --> 14:11.513
we're after okay anything else all right is there 
anything else that y'all want to add

14:18.800 --> 14:20.922
Well, my mother went to Greenbrier College. You 
never asked me where she went to college.

14:25.666 --> 14:30.050
Are

14:25.666 --> 14:30.050
we missing anything? I'm sitting back trying to 
think.

14:44.363 --> 14:46.545
I suppose if we think of something we can Oh, yeah. 
Like I said, you'll have an opportunity to get this

14:47.305 --> 14:52.793
back and you can add some things to it if you want to 
or whatever. One thing I think that people should

14:52.833 --> 15:05.492
know is my father had an incredible sense of humor 
and was great at playing jokes on people. Okay. And

15:07.155 --> 15:08.797
you saw that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he did do that. And he 
was... Very quick, very clever.

15:17.575 --> 15:45.743
and so he had a lot of fun I can there are some funny 
stories of pranks he pulled on people but what was

15:17.575 --> 15:45.743
the best one he pulled

15:17.575 --> 15:45.743
the best one he pulled was when he he

15:17.575 --> 15:45.743
had these lawyers from Houston coming out to the 
house and both of them their last names were

15:46.027 --> 16:13.333
Hutchison both of well no Hutchison and Grundy I 
believe anyway they were coming out to go hunting

15:46.027 --> 16:13.333
and they had never been out to our house before the 
one that you've been to um

15:46.027 --> 16:13.333
and so he said now he gave them directions and he 
said now listen you better turn in you better get it

15:46.027 --> 16:13.333
right the first time because we have some 
neighbors and they don't like being bothered at

16:13.955 --> 16:17.380
night and they might shoot at you. And so they were, 
they were coming, I would say they got to the house

16:19.963 --> 16:24.950
about eight or so at night. And so daddy could see 
their car coming up the gravel road. So he turned

16:31.619 --> 16:42.814
all the lights out in the whole house

16:31.619 --> 16:42.814
and he got up on that, the roof, the deck up there 
with a shotgun and so when they pulled up he started

16:43.537 --> 17:05.612
screaming and yelling at them and wanting to know 
who they were and shooting his gun up in the air and

16:43.537 --> 17:05.612
they were flying under the car and finally he 
couldn't quit laughing long enough to carry it on

16:43.537 --> 17:05.612
and he said come on guys it's me just playing a joke 
on you

17:07.381 --> 17:12.369
I would expect that he probably picked up a lot of 
that at A&M where he started pulling pranks at A&M.

17:12.649 --> 17:13.310
Probably. Those guys were famous for all of that.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.623
And that was real entertaining for his children. 
Oh, I bet it was. I bet so. What do you think was his

17:27.872 --> 17:30.857
most significant

17:42.734 --> 17:56.052
Well, before I answer that, the other thing I 
wanted to tell you that I just remembered is he and

17:42.734 --> 17:56.052
my mother for many, many years, if you recall 
correctly, the state of Texas was predominantly

17:42.734 --> 17:56.052
democratic. and they were very involved with the 
grassroots Republican Party and worked very hard

17:57.567 --> 18:27.102
and went to many conventions and were very 
dedicated in their effort there so I wanted to tell

17:57.567 --> 18:27.102
you that his greatest accomplishment

17:57.567 --> 18:27.102
I don't know in his mind I think it was selling the 
irrigation company the way he did and with the

17:57.567 --> 18:27.102
contract that he had behind it and for the amount of 
money that he got for it only because he and LCRA had

18:27.740 --> 18:39.397
been at odds for a number of years and then to 
finally come together and both get what they

18:27.740 --> 18:39.397
wanted. Wouldn't you say that was... I think that 
was probably the most, even for the state of Texas,

18:42.301 --> 18:46.727
where the water's concerned. They both felt that 
they were in a win-win situation. Right. He took

18:52.481 --> 19:02.056
care of the farmers in the surrounding 
communities by the contract that he has with LCRA

18:52.481 --> 19:02.056
to supply water for this system at least for the 
next 10 years. He froze the rates on the water for

19:03.057 --> 19:10.188
five years so the farmers could manhandle and help 
them. He froze the rates for five years in his

19:10.228 --> 19:12.712
contract. And he even he looked after the people 
here at that point when he was selling that company

19:17.842 --> 19:46.498
and as far as there were two things that he wanted to 
make sure were taken care of in that contract when

19:17.842 --> 19:46.498
he sold it he was going to take care of the farmers in 
the community he was going to take care of the

19:17.842 --> 19:46.498
employees and that was the two main concerns in 
either or if they did not take care of any of those he

19:17.842 --> 19:46.498
wouldn't sell it so it wasn't really i mean he did 
get a lot of money for it don't get me wrong but it

19:17.842 --> 19:46.498
wasn't just dollars that that made him do what he 
did.

19:52.198 --> 19:53.459
Is it okay to talk about his sister? Sure. I 
understand they were fairly close, is that right?

19:59.387 --> 19:59.728
Yes.

20:06.376 --> 20:12.785
I guess from, was there an estate then that the two 
of them had from, is it W.K. then, right? Right. Is

20:14.587 --> 20:16.249
that the way he left that to him? Yes, to the two of 
them. Did they work pretty close over the years or

20:20.029 --> 20:23.634
did Bill pretty much just run everything? Bill ran 
everything. She was happy just to... She stayed at

20:26.938 --> 20:33.827
Eagle Pass and he ran everything from her part of 
the family. And we still do to this day. Right. It's

20:37.812 --> 20:39.034
all still run through here. She's still in Eagle 
Pass.

20:44.261 --> 20:45.763
She just didn't have an interest in... No, I guess 
not, and her husband wanted to be in Eagle Pass and

20:48.427 --> 21:03.583
do ranching there, and it was, I guess, 
geographically not, she wasn't capable of

20:48.427 --> 21:03.583
staying really that involved. She has a family 
also, right? Yes, she has three sons. Are they

21:10.270 --> 21:12.392
going into ranching also? uh one of them sort of 
hits and misses at ranching they have two ranches

21:12.980 --> 21:24.407
and he he kind of plays around with one and then his 
father plays around with the other Then they have a

21:26.783 --> 21:37.315
younger, the youngest is in California, and he is 
in the music recording business in some fashion.

21:38.816 --> 21:47.386
And then the middle son is in Arizona, and he was 
involved in computers. Do you know what he's

21:47.446 --> 21:48.527
doing? I don't know what he's doing now, but he was 
something in the computer industry at one time.

21:57.074 --> 22:03.867
So you never really got to know her that close since 
she was out in Eagle Pass? Oh yes, oh yes. I know her

22:05.530 --> 22:07.614
very well. I talk to her sometimes twice a day. 
Nancy knows her probably, she's closer to her than

22:10.258 --> 22:17.432
any of the other brothers and sisters. Yeah, she 
calls Nancy quite a bit. to find out, too, what's

22:20.277 --> 22:22.361
going on here. They come to our annual meetings, 
but basically, as far as I'm concerned in this area

22:23.123 --> 22:31.360
here, we see them like once a year because they're 
stockholders. I don't know if they visited a lot in

22:32.762 --> 22:35.809
the younger years. No, a couple of times a year, 
probably. She's very into gardening, though. She

22:41.598 --> 22:42.579
loves flowers. And her yard is just gorgeous. She 
sends me pictures all the time of all the flowers

22:48.148 --> 22:52.715
and stuff that she's growing. That's her thing. 
And her mother was very into gardening,

22:54.337 --> 22:57.743
especially roses. And so I think she gets that from 
her mother. And she had 100% trust in Bill, so she

23:03.311 --> 23:08.239
let him handle everything. I would say that speaks 
a lot. Not too many people will do that in a court.

23:15.277 --> 23:23.272
Well, my father, and I've had many people tell me 
this, was probably one of the fairest, most honest

23:15.277 --> 23:23.272
men they knew. And he was, in my personal opinion, 
overboard in his fairness to her. Not that I

23:33.633 --> 23:45.730
dislike her, but he was the type of person he would 
rather be overly so than have someone come back to

23:33.633 --> 23:45.730
him and go, well, now, what's this or that? So he 
always took great care, don't you think, Ralph, in

23:47.553 --> 23:58.408
seeing that everything was on the up and up and fair 
and square. But did they communicate back and

23:58.777 --> 24:02.863
forth pretty regular then, even though they were 
only here a couple of times a year? Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.

24:03.944 --> 24:04.986
All the time, by phone. By telephone. He'd, she'd 
always call. And he called her.

24:13.057 --> 24:15.941
Did, did they ever talk about growing up together, 
or?

24:19.206 --> 24:20.388
About growing up together? Mm-hmm. As kids, and 
what they did, and things like that? Well, a little

24:25.134 --> 24:27.838
bit, I guess. He'd pull, well he was pulling pranks 
on her when she was dating. Putting potatoes in

24:35.728 --> 24:53.684
exhaust pipes and dates exhaust pipes and I 
remember when he was little I don't know what

24:35.728 --> 24:53.684
prompted her to do this but she shaved off his 
eyebrows so he had to go around without any

24:35.728 --> 24:53.684
eyebrows for a while. So I guess they had a typical 
childhood yeah that's great they sound like well

24:58.818 --> 25:24.032
they're kind of mischievous oh yeah brothers and 
sisters that got along but at the time they didn't

24:58.818 --> 25:24.032
you know how it goes well everybody has that oh and 
then they did he and a friend of his somehow wired up

24:58.818 --> 25:24.032
her toilet i remember him telling me that and then 
they would do something when she'd go to the

25:25.058 --> 25:53.547
bathroom and she'd fly and I guess she had a 
girlfriend over too I guess and it would shock them

25:25.058 --> 25:53.547
every time they tried to go to the restroom they 
wired up the commode seat yeah he did tell me that

25:25.058 --> 25:53.547
uh-huh in fact that's why he got into engineering 
could be

25:25.058 --> 25:53.547
mm-hmm what if now what about your uh your granddad 
um Did you know him for quite a while then? Oh yes, I

25:56.349 --> 25:57.792
was very close to him. He was, well he had a great 
sense of humor, but he was also a very serious

26:00.278 --> 26:06.233
person. He loved to travel. He was very into 
genealogy and was putting all that together, and I

26:10.807 --> 26:18.097
still have that stuff that I need to go to work on. He 
was diabetic. He was a very disciplined man

26:22.363 --> 26:30.074
because he was insulin dependent and had to watch 
his diet and had to exercise. So he was disciplined

26:30.995 --> 26:34.580
and sort of regimented, if you will. But he didn't 
let it bother him. He went ahead and did everything

26:37.924 --> 26:40.628
he always wanted to do. There were greenhouses 
there. Didn't he grow like the greenhouses or was

26:44.517 --> 26:48.062
it your grandmother? Well, all the greenhouses 
were hers. But I do know that he decided, because of

26:51.127 --> 27:00.262
the diet that he was on and his travels, he got real 
into papayas and mangoes. So he was going to figure

27:01.183 --> 27:04.388
out how to grow them here. And actually he did 
accomplish it. He had these huge things that had

27:07.433 --> 27:14.953
plastic and would cover them. He actually 
successfully grew mangoes and papayas.

27:20.749 --> 27:21.651
Very interesting. Anything he wanted to do, he was 
going to do it. And that was basically my dad's

27:26.128 --> 27:28.732
philosophy too. If they wanted to do it, they were 
going to find a way to get it done. That's just the

27:32.618 --> 27:33.860
way they were. Spent a lot of time thinking about 
it. Mm-hmm. Oh, my father didn't sleep most of the

27:36.644 --> 27:41.712
time because there was something on his mind that 
he was going to figure out. He wasn't going to ever

27:43.755 --> 27:45.878
make a real hasty decision. If you came to him, he 
thought it through before. If it was something

27:49.603 --> 27:50.625
important, He thought it well through before he 
ever made the decision to do it. Probably why

27:55.715 --> 27:58.380
you're successful at what you're doing. Right. 
And he did have a tractor dealership here back in

27:58.680 --> 28:04.389
the 80s. The fact right here where we're sitting, 
there were tractors and combines. We had the

28:07.755 --> 28:10.740
International and Case dealership here. And back 
then, Times were hard, and hardly any new

28:14.062 --> 28:19.768
equipment was selling, and he decided to get out of 
the business. And he did right at, whenever he

28:20.189 --> 28:30.440
decided he did it at the right time, because right 
after that, the bottom fell out of all of the market

28:20.189 --> 28:30.440
for new tractors and combines and all. He did it 
just at the right time. And that was back in the

28:33.784 --> 28:37.328
early 80s. I think we got out of that in about 1983.

28:42.293 --> 28:43.875
Now, what about your grandmother? You said she was 
really heavily involved in gardening? Yes, and

28:47.981 --> 28:51.165
she was a big DAR person. I can't remember that 
much. She traveled quite a bit with him. They both

28:57.494 --> 29:03.102
were quite involved in the Methodist Church here 
locally. In fact, it's now called the Laram

29:03.142 --> 29:06.166
Memorial. Laram Memorial United Methodist 
Church. And what was her name?

29:13.242 --> 29:16.447
Dottie or Dorothy, Dorothy Ann.

29:20.353 --> 29:28.325
Now what about your mother's parents?

29:28.345 --> 29:29.607
They were from Ohio. He was an engineer for the 
railroads and so he was gone an awful lot. And they

29:39.331 --> 29:44.862
moved to Weston, West Virginia, which is where my 
mother was born. And her mother had rheumatoid

29:44.902 --> 29:49.070
arthritis. And in fact, was bedridden with it. 
most of her life and she developed uh I guess a

29:53.945 --> 30:23.209
bladder infection and they were sulfur drugs were 
just new and out and they put her on sulfur drugs but

29:53.945 --> 30:23.209
back then they didn't know to tell them to drink a 
lot of water so she passed away of uremic poisoning

29:53.945 --> 30:23.209
she had a sister an older sister um who did marry and

30:25.433 --> 30:26.615
Was she a Latin teacher? She was very bright. But 
she was asphyxiated by a gas heater, young in her

30:28.998 --> 30:36.449
marriage, in the bathroom. And she didn't have any 
children. So then her father moved

30:40.115 --> 30:46.564
to Circleville, I guess. And they had a little farm 
up there and then he finally ended up moving down

30:47.253 --> 30:58.223
here with us and staying here for a while prior to 
his death. So you got to know him pretty good. I did.

31:01.066 --> 31:10.134
One of his favorite tricks to do to my mother is 
evidently working around all these railroad type

31:01.066 --> 31:10.134
guys. When they'd run into snakes, they'd pick up 
these snakes and twirl them in the air and pop their

31:10.835 --> 31:16.720
heads off. My dad used to do that. And so his 
favorite thing to do to her is when she was having

31:18.936 --> 31:29.258
her bridge club in or her DAR ladies over, he'd go 
and pop the head.
