00:01.685 --> 00:18.746
Mr. Whitfield, tell us something about your early 
life, including the names of your parents, the

00:01.685 --> 00:18.746
dates and places of their births and death, the 
place and date of your birth, and the schools you

00:01.685 --> 00:18.746
attended before you entered Texas A&M. Well, my 
father was James Whitfield, and he was born in

00:20.668 --> 00:27.456
Georgia. I can't tell you exactly when. Now, 
where? My mother was Eliza Whitfield Brown. She

00:38.579 --> 00:43.023
was Eliza Brown, born in Rush County, Texas. I 
can't tell you that exactly. I might figure it

00:46.266 --> 00:49.929
back. I could figure it. Can we put that at the end of 
the tape? Let me do a little figuring. I don't want

00:55.414 --> 00:56.375
to slow the thing up. Or if you can tell us when they 
died and how old they were. Well, my father died in

01:00.393 --> 01:06.201
1922.

01:11.848 --> 01:14.411
He was 82 years old. My mother died in 1932.

01:22.942 --> 01:25.546
She was 77 years old. She was a good bit younger than 
he was. I was born at Henderson, Texas, January the

01:31.696 --> 01:36.741
12th, 1892.

01:40.664 --> 01:44.027
And you want me to go from there? Right. All right. 
So when I was just 12, 8 or 9 years old, my parents

01:45.088 --> 02:01.703
moved to Tom Green County, a ranch north of San 
Angelo, and I grew up on that ranch going to school

01:45.088 --> 02:01.703
in a horse and buggy And later they moved into town 
so we could have the benefit of these. What was the

02:08.606 --> 02:09.527
ranch? Did the ranch have a name? No, just James 
Whitfield Ranch. James Whitfield. Your father

02:15.091 --> 02:17.153
owned the ranch. Okay. Did you have any 
responsibilities on the ranch as you were growing

02:19.295 --> 02:23.079
up? Oh, just to the normal youngsters growing up. I 
rode a horse along with everybody else. For how

02:32.142 --> 02:36.448
many years then did you ride the horse and buggy 
back and forth to school every day? I'd say until

02:36.508 --> 02:44.199
about four years. Then you moved into San Angelo. 
Moved into San Angelo, yes. Was your move from

02:48.384 --> 02:52.170
Henderson, was it? From Henderson to San Angelo. 
To the ranch in San Angelo. Was that by train? By

02:57.317 --> 02:57.737
train. My father used a boxcar to transfer the as 
they did in those days, some livestock. I don't

03:07.076 --> 03:07.997
know what it was. I just don't remember seeing any. 
It was a milk cow, probably. There wasn't any. What

03:14.323 --> 03:19.689
kind of business had he been engaged in in 
Henderson before he moved to the ranch? He had

03:19.709 --> 03:24.453
formerly been, he had had some sheep business. 
He'd been tax collector in Rusk County at one time.

03:30.952 --> 03:41.707
Must have been somewhat of a gamble to give up a 
steady job, so to speak, as a tax collector or

03:30.952 --> 03:41.707
county official to take on a ranch. Well, 
primarily he was a rancher, a farmer. He wanted to

03:45.072 --> 03:47.836
get back into that business. Was San Angelo, or 
that area, I gather, was a pretty wide-open area?

03:56.568 --> 03:58.030
bleak place, was it? Well, no. San Angelo was a 
fairly good town at that time. It was small, of

04:02.114 --> 04:03.375
course. But it was wide open, as you say. They had 
saloons and honky-tonk and all that.

04:15.508 --> 04:17.970
Then you graduated from San Angelo High School? 
No, I took my last two years of high school at

04:17.990 --> 04:22.795
Trinity University at Waxahachie.

04:25.373 --> 04:27.735
Why did you choose to do that? Well, my parents 
chose it for me. Was that a larger and better school

04:32.180 --> 04:35.483
than San Angelo? Well, it was Trenton University. 
It's at San Antonio now, you know. And they had what

04:40.147 --> 04:43.250
they called the Academy at that time. It was 
sub-freshmen.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.056
Well, it would take two years. They would take you 
in your junior and senior year of high school. So

04:53.120 --> 04:54.081
that's where I got my high school and didn't get a 
diploma. I just finished the work. Finished the

04:58.915 --> 04:59.496
work. What factors were involved in your choice of 
Texas A&M? Oh, I don't know. I guess growing up on a

05:09.911 --> 05:14.477
ranch, I was interested in livestock. So

05:14.518 --> 05:18.904
you had the opportunity. And I had had an uncle 
prior to My mother's brothers attended A&M, but he

05:22.478 --> 05:28.524
didn't graduate. He attended for a year. So you 
knew of the agricultural instruction that was

05:29.826 --> 05:34.471
available there, and you were going for that.

05:37.534 --> 05:48.646
You said you didn't receive a diploma, so to speak, 
from Trinity,

05:37.534 --> 05:48.646
so you didn't have a diploma when you entered Texas 
A&M. What kind of procedure did you go through to

05:52.685 --> 06:07.759
Oh, I don't know if Charles Friely was there then or 
not, but I took some grades from Trinity with me,

05:52.685 --> 06:07.759
not a transcript, but the courses I had taken, they 
admitted me with that. You didn't, as the students

06:08.539 --> 06:12.543
do today, apply months in advance? Oh, no. No, I 
just showed up down there. You just showed up in

06:15.125 --> 06:18.408
time for registration. Yeah. What was your first 
reaction? to the school and to the community when

06:22.013 --> 06:24.416
you arrived? Well, that's rather interesting. 
Charlie Moran was a fish along with me, and they

06:28.862 --> 06:36.172
were working out for football. And I was Don Lee's 
freshman.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.544
He was a San Angelo boy. He was a junior that year. 
And he told me that he was in company C, and he told me

06:49.840 --> 07:01.895
to get into company C. Well, I went through the mill 
and got Captain Moses, who was a commandant at that

06:49.840 --> 07:01.895
time. He asked me if I had a preface to company, and I 
said, yes, sir, C. And I guess I was scared of

07:03.076 --> 07:17.974
something, but he put down G. So I went to G, and Don 
Lee, at that time, we were in Goodman Hall, and we

07:03.076 --> 07:17.974
had to go around the south end of Foster Hall. And 
there was a bunch of football players, and Don Lee

07:18.933 --> 07:23.638
introduced me to them as his fish. I don't know what 
he told them, but he invited them to have at it, and

07:25.320 --> 07:32.467
they did.

07:32.487 --> 07:34.989
You say Charlie Moran was a fish. Freshman. He was a 
freshman coach. He was a freshman. That was his

07:38.113 --> 07:40.675
first, 1909 was his first. First year as coach. So 
right after you registered then, the football

07:43.558 --> 07:47.462
players kind of worked you over. Yes, that's 
right. but

07:50.320 --> 07:55.567
it was kind of a warm reception. Really a warm 
reception. I was ready to go home.

08:03.919 --> 08:09.507
After that, were you still Mr. Lee's fish, even 
though you were in different companies? No, I got

08:11.069 --> 08:12.772
to be a fish. The old boy that looked after me was 
named Lake Robertson. He was from Bollinger.

08:18.923 --> 08:22.067
which is just this side of San Angelo. He took me 
under his wing and guided me, but Don looked after

08:22.087 --> 08:29.638
me once in a while. He'd come by to see how I was 
getting along. So primarily if you were

08:31.861 --> 08:35.566
somebody's fish, it was an upperclassman in your 
company. Yes, that's right. That sort of activity

08:37.829 --> 08:45.340
didn't cross company lines, is the rule.

08:45.360 --> 08:45.420
No. Were you assigned to Goodwin Hall? Yes. Then 
the first year you were there. What other

08:50.261 --> 08:51.963
dormitories did you live in? Mitchell. The first 
year that Mitchell was occupied, they moved G

08:52.984 --> 08:58.349
Company into Mitchell. And then did you stay in 
Mitchell the rest of the time? Just the one year,

09:01.833 --> 09:03.314
yes, my senior year. Your senior year in Mitchell.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.801
What was life like in those dormitories? Well...

09:16.670 --> 09:17.712
There was lots of fun. You and Aggie? No. Well, you 
haven't had the experience. I don't know whether

09:26.005 --> 09:33.938
they did it in your age time or not, but we had plenty 
of hazing going on. It wasn't wild. They'd strap

09:37.724 --> 09:38.525
you. Usually

09:38.565 --> 09:43.453
they'd have somebody would... take you and tell 
you to report after dinner, after supper, every

09:43.771 --> 09:49.739
night. You'd go in and if you were a good fish they'd 
just slap you once or twice and let you go, but if you

09:50.079 --> 10:00.573
were an honorary fish they'd let you have it. And we 
had some peanut racers up and down the hall with our

10:03.176 --> 10:07.602
noses, you know, somebody standing by on his 
drivers, things of that sort. A couple of fish

10:11.740 --> 10:17.509
racing against each other?

10:17.529 --> 10:17.729
Yes. But it was good life. It was lots of fun. Lots of 
bull sessions? Oh, yeah.

10:30.869 --> 10:36.458
Of course, at that time, after we got through with 
supper, They marched us to our meals, but after we

10:37.838 --> 10:42.983
were through eating, we all just straggled on. And 
we had to call the quarters at that time. You had to

10:48.769 --> 10:55.436
be in your room, and

10:48.769 --> 10:55.436
then they blew an assembly, I guess. I don't 
remember what the people's call was.

11:01.963 --> 11:06.107
I believe it was at 7 o'clock or 7.30. You had to be in 
your room. And we had all student government at

11:09.993 --> 11:12.235
that time. And there were no profs or no sergeants 
or anything in the dorms. It was all the captain of

11:19.563 --> 11:28.793
the company was responsible for the behavior of 
the fellows in his company. And we had inspection

11:29.754 --> 11:36.381
right after call to quarters to see that you were in 
your room. You stayed in there until what we called

11:37.812 --> 11:46.240
Tattoo, which was 1015, and then at 1030 we had 
taps, and you had to have your lights out. I guess

11:46.260 --> 11:50.865
Kerber told you all that, didn't he? Well, he was 
pretty much the same when he was there.

11:58.032 --> 12:03.137
Did you take it a sentry walking the hallways 
during the flight hour? Yeah. And we all stood

12:04.057 --> 12:07.701
guard, all the privates. walked post in the 
different dormitories, and we had an officer of

12:08.221 --> 12:18.976
the day from the corps, the sergeant of the guard, 
and the corporal of the guard. Now was this all day?

12:21.540 --> 12:22.461
No, just at night. Just during the quiet hours? Of 
course, the officer of the day and the sergeant of

12:23.983 --> 12:36.000
the guard were all day long, but the sentries were 
just at night, to walk post during the study hour.

12:37.195 --> 12:45.526
When somebody was assigned as officer of the day, 
was he in the quarters all day then? Or did he have to

12:45.606 --> 12:48.570
leave when he went to class? He was in the guard room 
all day or whatever it was. I think it was a guard

12:52.515 --> 12:53.756
room. But he had to make inspections of the rooms to 
see that the beds were made and that they were

12:54.717 --> 12:59.924
clean. Well, if he was officer of the day, then was 
he excused from classes for that day? Oh, yes. Yes.

13:08.617 --> 13:12.722
This was done on a rotating basis, I would gather. 
Yes. So you would be officer of the day only a couple

13:14.044 --> 13:18.710
of times, I suppose, in a turn. Probably. I just 
don't recall how often.

13:25.239 --> 13:25.579
Okay.

13:31.387 --> 13:34.551
What kind of activity did you have right after you 
got up? I mean, you were awakened by the bugle?

13:37.015 --> 13:37.375
Bugle. We did everything to the bugle. We had 
revelry. We got out and did calisthenics. For

13:43.960 --> 13:46.244
about how long? Oh, 10 minutes, I'd say. And then 
you do what? Dress, shave, dress. Went over and

13:53.694 --> 13:55.257
assembled for breakfast. And they marched us to 
breakfast. And as I say, after we finished eating,

14:01.225 --> 14:06.653
we just wandered back to quarters. and then 
getting ready to go to class. Yes. And sometime

14:10.164 --> 14:17.892
during the day, this man that was officer of the day 
would inspect your quarters to make sure that they

14:10.164 --> 14:17.892
were made properly. And everything was cleaned 
up. The floor was clean. The GI bucket was...

14:23.297 --> 14:33.006
We had that in

14:23.297 --> 14:33.006
Goodwin Hall. In Mitchell, we had a little 
different proposition. A little better. You had a

14:37.345 --> 14:40.128
regular bathroom? Yeah, we had showers. We had to 
go to Natler, Goodman Hall, to get our baths. Well,

14:46.175 --> 14:49.078
Goodman Hall was then a fairly new dormitory, 
wasn't it? It didn't have any showers. That's

14:51.100 --> 14:53.342
right. No, we went to Natler until, well, fall of 
1912 when we went to Mitchell Hall. I don't know

15:03.413 --> 15:06.036
what they did in Goodman Hall after that. Because 
it seemed to me that the old natatorium that they

15:06.691 --> 15:14.159
called it was the one with the steam plant. It 
wasn't a natatorium, it was just showers. They

15:16.021 --> 15:19.945
called it the natatorium. But

15:19.965 --> 15:32.158
it seemed to me that it was closed right about fall 
of 1912. Did they require you to take a shower

15:33.067 --> 15:36.993
regularly, or did you just, was that? No, it was 
voluntary. It was voluntary. Yeah, because you

15:38.996 --> 15:48.250
were inspected regularly, so you had to keep 
clean.

15:48.410 --> 16:00.728
I ask that partly because I recently read some 
letters written by a fellow who was there in the

15:48.410 --> 16:00.728
1880s, and he indicated that he bathed regularly, 
but one of the other boys had been taken to the

16:01.433 --> 16:14.652
doctor because he was quite ill, and the doctor 
asked him about how often he bathed, and the boy

16:01.433 --> 16:14.652
said he had bathed twice since he'd been there, 
about two and a half months, and both of those were

16:01.433 --> 16:14.652
in the first week. Yeah.

16:18.257 --> 16:20.720
I mean, he was smelling the high heaven with it. I 
would imagine he was, yeah.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.753
About how much time did you spend drilling? On a 
daily basis, or did you drill daily? No, we drilled

16:32.869 --> 16:36.254
every Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. For an 
hour, I believe. I believe that's right. Did you

16:41.342 --> 16:43.705
have classes on Saturday as well as the other day? 
Saturday morning. Saturday afternoon was fairly

16:45.769 --> 16:47.731
free then? Free,

16:47.792 --> 16:51.137
yeah. Okay. What was the food like in the mess hall? 
Well, I enjoyed it. It was good. I'll never forget

16:56.851 --> 17:03.740
the

16:56.851 --> 17:03.740
coconut pie. I was a fish, and I remarked how much I 
liked coconut pie, and there were two pies on the

17:03.900 --> 17:10.369
table, and I ate them both. That must have been 
something for a fish to get two whole pies. Well,

17:15.355 --> 17:17.018
they made me eat them. The sophomores are sort of 
that. Did they not like them? Oh, no, they just

17:21.524 --> 17:25.609
wanted me to have all the pie I wanted. Normally 
it's the other way around, isn't it? The

17:29.736 --> 17:31.138
upperclassmen get the cushion. That's right. 
They get the cushion. I

17:32.540 --> 17:41.473
just made the remark, boy, there's some coconut 
pie, and I sure do like it. Fish, you really like

17:41.933 --> 17:44.016
coconut pie. Yeah, well, just eat both of these 
pies.

17:49.484 --> 17:55.933
At a normal table, I realized that the company ate 
together. Now, obviously, the whole company

17:56.656 --> 18:00.462
couldn't get it at one table. About how many people 
would be at the table? No. We had two

18:02.885 --> 18:10.216
sophomores at each table. They sat at the end, the 
corporals. And as I recall, we had about 14 at the

18:13.942 --> 18:21.914
table. And the company would be, what, about 100? 
That or a little less. Most of the time they were in

18:27.164 --> 18:30.788
the 80s too. So anywhere from six to seven tables 
would be company.

18:44.540 --> 18:51.587
What privileges did the upperclassmen enjoy that 
the freshmen didn't have?

18:52.698 --> 19:03.428
A freshman could do most anything that he could get 
by with, except,

18:52.698 --> 19:03.428
you mean so far as the school is concerned now? 
Yeah. Freshman didn't have many privileges in the

19:05.350 --> 19:13.418
dorm, because the upperclassmen saw that he was 
kept in line. That was part of his training. But a

19:17.542 --> 19:22.266
freshman couldn't go to town, couldn't go to 
Bryan, once every month or something like that.

19:27.997 --> 19:29.539
That would be only on a Saturday afternoon. Yeah, 
on a Saturday afternoon. Or maybe Sunday, I don't

19:32.663 --> 19:34.987
know. I'd have to go to Brian on Sunday. I seldom 
went on Saturdays. Was the Tunerville trolley

19:40.173 --> 19:43.538
working or in operation? It was a motor-driven bus 
my senior year. What was it? It was none in

19:52.773 --> 19:55.056
existence before that at all? How would you get to 
Bryan before that? Either walk or ride a freight

19:57.280 --> 19:58.942
train. Ride a freight train. Didn't the passenger 
train stop in? No, it wasn't until the proper time.

20:04.290 --> 20:08.477
Yeah, they stopped at College Station, the INGN 
and H&TC, too. They both came through at that time.

20:11.061 --> 20:13.324
I don't know if they still do or not, do they? Well, 
they still have the tracks there. They come

20:15.688 --> 20:19.253
through as freight trains, I believe. But those 
trains, it was not convenient to take those. No,

20:22.094 --> 20:25.217
the hours weren't convenient to take into Bryan. 
But you could hop, could hop a freight. Could hop a

20:26.719 --> 20:28.260
freight. Or walk. Or walk. It's about a, what, 
five-mile hike? About a five-mile hike. Into what

20:34.206 --> 20:36.048
would have been downtown Bryan. Yeah. What, for 
what purposes did the students go to Bryan? Oh,

20:44.776 --> 20:48.480
just to go to town, more or less, I think. Wade Cox 
had a pool hall that got quite a play, all right. I

20:54.347 --> 20:56.630
don't know if you've ever heard of Wade Cox's pool 
hall. No, never heard of Wade Cox's pool hall. He

20:58.833 --> 21:06.985
had a pool hall that got a lot of play, and the Harry 
Jenkins Bar got a little play, too. I don't know if

21:08.988 --> 21:10.490
you've heard of his place. No. Maybe I'm talking 
too much. No, you're not talking too much. I don't

21:20.489 --> 21:33.587
know, in those days the cadets could go in and get a 
nigger to get them some beer or something.

21:33.607 --> 21:38.974
I should say a black or colored person,

21:33.607 --> 21:38.974
rather. But they went to Brown to, they probably, 
some fellows had girls who they knew that they

21:38.994 --> 21:48.387
wanted to call on, particularly upperclassmen.

21:51.657 --> 21:53.440
But the freshmen, they didn't have anybody. They 
didn't have any cause to go to Bryan, really,

21:53.460 --> 21:55.903
truly. As far as anything that they needed for 
school, I presume that was available on campus,

21:57.726 --> 22:03.975
probably. Oh, yes. So we wouldn't have to go to 
Bryan to buy things. What was that bohemian that

22:11.145 --> 22:14.169
made the uniforms? I had the uniforms. Charlie... 
Mitchie? Mitchie, yeah. He made the uniforms and

22:20.311 --> 22:24.615
had everything that you needed in the way of 
clothing. Where was his shop? I don't recall. It

22:29.680 --> 22:41.952
seemed to me it was in the,

22:29.680 --> 22:41.952
to the left. That's the present Nassau, the old 
Spieser Hall, the present Spieser Hall. It was the

22:47.513 --> 22:50.016
left and back of it a little, as I recall. Of course,

22:50.036 --> 22:58.125
not too far from Gathright Hall. Let's see, the Y 
was not built until after you, was not completed

22:58.225 --> 23:04.012
until after you graduated, was it? That's right. 
We had just a basement, as I think. So there was a

23:07.396 --> 23:10.159
basement portion of it completed while you were 
there. What was available down there? Oh, not much

23:11.520 --> 23:15.725
of anything. Not much of anything, no. Did you have 
any kind of place where students could gather

23:18.091 --> 23:23.899
socially? Oh, we had an old barn for a gym.

23:33.472 --> 23:36.737
I don't think they even had a name for it, as I 
recall. Just a gym? Just a gym. Okay. Was that where

23:41.143 --> 23:43.626
the basketball team played? Did intramural 
basketball play there, too? There wasn't any

23:47.049 --> 23:48.571
intramural basketball. There was intramural 
baseball and football. Basketball didn't come in

23:51.636 --> 23:53.619
until later, did it? No. I was managing the first 
basketball team A&M ever had. That is, of the

23:58.627 --> 24:00.791
college basketball team? Yeah. I believe, let's 
see, you were there when both the Old Main and the

24:09.728 --> 24:11.390
original mess hall burning, weren't you? I was a 
fireman. You fought the fire. Bucket Brigade. I

24:18.257 --> 24:20.440
imagine that was quite something, wasn't it? Oh, 
it was. The mess hall, as I recall, burned just

24:23.363 --> 24:27.648
before Christmas, and they had us go home a little 
early. We came back, and they had an old

24:28.729 --> 24:32.413
contonement built in the fetus there. A what? A 
contonement, kind of a ramshackle. Army-type

24:37.775 --> 24:42.519
structure, you know, for emergencies. So that's 
where you ate until—? Until Spieser was finished.

24:45.963 --> 24:46.483
Spieser was finished. It was finished

24:46.503 --> 24:57.454
for—gosh, it was—when

24:46.503 --> 24:57.454
did it burn? I've forgotten. Was it in the spring of 
12? I believe so, yeah. Old Main burned in 11, I

25:06.361 --> 25:10.026
believe, in Mesa. Mesa burned before Main did. 
Mesa burned first, and then Main. Yeah. That's not

25:18.158 --> 25:21.503
much difference, I don't suppose. We have a number 
of pictures of the old Main building during the

25:21.523 --> 25:30.275
fire, and some of the walls there are still left. 
How did they tear down the walls? Or do you recall? I

25:34.301 --> 25:35.102
don't recall. I don't believe they'd torn them 
down one night. Yes, they bound to have torn them

25:38.866 --> 25:41.469
down before I graduated. Because I believe they 
started the new building on the same location and

25:42.430 --> 25:48.176
completed it by 14. Had they? Yeah. So the new one 
was probably being constructed your final year

25:51.240 --> 25:54.984
there.

26:00.069 --> 26:05.916
Did the cadet officers enjoy any particular 
privileges that were not available to the other

26:00.069 --> 26:05.916
cadets? No. You mentioned, say, in the mess hall 
that you had a corporal at either end of the table.

26:15.062 --> 26:16.966
Where did the other company officers eat? They 
were scattered around in there and all through the

26:17.887 --> 26:23.237
tables. Did they not eat with the company? Oh, yes. 
Yes. What about the regimental officers? Did they

26:27.805 --> 26:28.386
eat? They had a staff table. Staff table. Yeah. 
They were privileged. They got steaks and things

26:32.914 --> 26:37.380
like that. So the regimental officers had better 
food than you did. Yes, they did, yes. Was the same

26:43.107 --> 26:44.750
true for the athletes? Oh, yeah. The same table was 
a good place to eat. Well, when you were manager of

26:48.855 --> 26:52.400
the basketball team, did you get to eat with the 
athletes? You bet, you bet. That was a good

26:53.522 --> 26:55.424
incentive for being in. Oh, yeah. That's your 
watch. Uh-huh. Now, on this training table, did

27:00.250 --> 27:08.141
the athletes eat there the whole year or just while 
they were participating? Just during their

27:08.782 --> 27:12.547
season.

27:14.891 --> 27:20.138
Did the athletes have any other privileges other 
than the training table? No. They had to, when they

27:21.480 --> 27:26.547
weren't practicing, would have to do their 
regular drills? No, they didn't. Well, yeah, I'll

27:28.570 --> 27:30.072
take it back now. The football team and the 
baseball team, as I recall, didn't drill, but the

27:30.862 --> 27:42.358
basketball team did, because they—wait a minute, 
I'm not right about that.

27:45.442 --> 27:52.752
I was captain of the Chief Company, and I was the 
manager of the basketball team, so I'm bound to

27:45.442 --> 27:52.752
have drilled. I had to be with my company. So all 
companies drilled at the same time? Yeah. See, we

27:58.752 --> 28:02.256
just had three battalions, twelve companies. The 
parade ground took care of it pretty well. Did you

28:06.981 --> 28:08.563
have any favorite instructors? Well, yeah, I 
guess so. I guess you'd call Dr. Mark Francis one of

28:12.227 --> 28:16.751
my favorites. What did you particularly like 
about him? John Burns. What did you particularly

28:20.676 --> 28:22.958
like about Dr. Francis? Well, he was

28:23.292 --> 28:34.290
a good instructor, good teacher, and a rare 
character, if there ever was one. Is it all right if

28:36.553 --> 28:38.476
I tell you a little incident? Sure, let me make sure 
I have enough tape here on this side. Yeah, I

28:42.022 --> 28:42.603
believe so. Well, we had a fellow named Frank 
Lockridge in our company, and we had The vet

28:49.752 --> 28:53.696
science was taught was kind of an amphitheater.

28:57.059 --> 29:00.462
Frank would always sit over there in the open 
window and chew tobacco. Doc Francis got up one day

29:02.104 --> 29:10.292
and picked up a GI bucket and took it up there and put 
it down. He said, hey, Rube's spitting that. So he

29:14.836 --> 29:16.738
was Rube Lockridge from then on.

29:19.638 --> 29:22.523
Dr. Francis was quite a character. He was a 
wonderful man, and then John Burns, he was a

29:22.603 --> 29:28.053
prophet of the age. He was a good one.

29:33.702 --> 29:42.237
Bobby Smith, math prof. Carby Cameron tried to 
teach me some French, and it didn't take too well.

29:44.933 --> 29:45.955
I know what you mean. I had some French in the 
graduate school. Is that right? Well, Carby would

29:51.305 --> 29:58.679
try to get me to say the feminine of one, you know, 
U-N-E. I'd say, eun, and he'd say, no, it's not

29:59.641 --> 30:03.088
that, it's eun. I couldn't get to suit him at all. 
Well, the kind of French I took was not really so

30:07.900 --> 30:12.288
much in speaking but in translating. We were 
supposed to learn a few words, though, and they

30:12.708 --> 30:16.756
were just beyond me. Between my English and my 
German, I couldn't make those French words sound

30:16.816 --> 30:24.930
right.
