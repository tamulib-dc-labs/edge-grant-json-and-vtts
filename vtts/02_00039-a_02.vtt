WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:06.278
A fish to smoke?

00:06.298 --> 00:07.119
I don't really recall.

00:07.139 --> 00:09.724
I never did smoke, so I didn't really notice.

00:09.744 --> 00:14.394
But I don't know of any prohibition we had against smoking, so it probably was all right.

00:15.496 --> 00:24.233
As I recall, the only mischief that would be considered something that was out of line was

00:24.753 --> 00:27.636
You remember back when we were kids, they used to have firecrackers.

00:27.657 --> 00:30.120
They were small sticks of dynamite.

00:30.140 --> 00:30.720
That's what they were.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.002
We called them baby giants.

00:32.823 --> 00:39.030
Well, some of the guys got to wondering what would happen if they'd light a baby giant and flush it down a commode.

00:40.132 --> 00:40.953
Well, we found out.

00:41.233 --> 00:44.237
It blew that commode to smithereens.

00:44.257 --> 00:51.165
And I guess probably the size of a saucer would be about the biggest piece of that commode that was left.

00:51.652 --> 00:55.057
And we all got restricted to the campus for a couple of months for that.

00:55.598 --> 01:02.167
And I was not involved, but I don't even remember who was, but we were in the proximity, so we all suffered because of it.

01:02.768 --> 01:08.356
About how often did you go home during that time?

01:08.617 --> 01:10.640
I think Thanksgiving was my first time home.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.344
And homesick, first time I'd ever been away from home.

01:13.484 --> 01:14.746
And I almost died.

01:14.786 --> 01:15.607
I was so homesick.

01:15.667 --> 01:19.633
We had a very close-knit community, very close-knit family, a lot of affection.

01:19.968 --> 01:22.012
A lot of hugs, you know, those kind of things.

01:22.553 --> 01:24.857
But the minute I set foot on the campus, all that stopped.

01:25.859 --> 01:27.061
And I was so homesick.

01:27.362 --> 01:30.929
And we did, they had one old pay phone in the dining hall.

01:31.169 --> 01:33.614
And there'd be a long line of people waiting to use the pay phone.

01:33.634 --> 01:34.576
I think it cost a nickel.

01:34.596 --> 01:35.818
Of course, you could call Collect.

01:36.860 --> 01:40.026
But those phone calls were so important to me.

01:41.248 --> 01:42.090
What about mail?

01:42.130 --> 01:43.292
Did you write much?

01:43.559 --> 01:45.522
Wrote a lot, wrote a lot.

01:46.043 --> 01:53.453
A lot of the guys that had steady girlfriends back home would get what we called a Dear John letter, where she had found someone else and so forth.

01:54.014 --> 01:58.200
So then we would all write her a letter telling her what a dirty trick that was.

01:58.380 --> 02:02.085
So she'd get a lot of mail from the guy's buddies telling her how bad she was.

02:02.506 --> 02:05.550
Did your mom send you any...

02:06.172 --> 02:07.114
Cookies or cake?

02:07.314 --> 02:07.675
Oh, yes.

02:08.196 --> 02:08.978
That was called what?

02:09.138 --> 02:09.920
A care package.

02:10.261 --> 02:12.385
Well, that's what we called it later on.

02:12.646 --> 02:14.489
I don't know if we had a name for it in those days.

02:14.510 --> 02:14.830
Was that kush?

02:15.932 --> 02:17.556
No, well, now kush is dessert.

02:17.716 --> 02:19.761
That's part of your slanguage in the mess hall.

02:20.161 --> 02:22.466
But that wasn't applied to?

02:22.667 --> 02:24.771
Not applied to packages that you got from home.

02:25.375 --> 02:31.161
If you got any package of dessert from home, cookies or cake, were you expected to share it?

02:31.381 --> 02:31.942
Absolutely.

02:31.982 --> 02:35.666
You know, if you got a big box of cookies, if you got one or two, you'd be very lucky.

02:36.066 --> 02:40.751
The whole barracks, you know, if you got something from home, everybody would come in and we'd divide it equally.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.774
It was almost like an extended family.

02:44.255 --> 02:51.903
Who were the faculty members during that freshman year that made an impression on you?

02:53.385 --> 02:53.745
I had...

02:54.147 --> 03:00.358
I had a PE prof that kind of helped me along a whole lot, Amel Mammal Eagle.

03:00.638 --> 03:01.620
Did you ever know him?

03:03.103 --> 03:08.072
I took weight training as one of my PE exercises.

03:11.337 --> 03:18.450
Our chemistry class, lecture class, was so large that I don't remember who my freshman chemistry prof was.

03:19.932 --> 03:24.959
We had a guy, and I wanna, my memory's so hazy on this, but we called him Cube Root.

03:26.121 --> 03:29.366
Kent, Cube Root Kent, I believe was the gentleman's name.

03:30.087 --> 03:33.672
And there was another guy that lisped a lot, I think his name was Callahan.

03:34.373 --> 03:36.336
And I don't remember what course he taught, biology.

03:36.356 --> 03:38.519
No, wait, there was a guy that taught biology.

03:39.740 --> 03:44.287
His name was Ripma, R-I-P-M-A, I don't know what his first name was.

03:44.888 --> 03:49.855
But I'll never forget, the very first lecture he gave us was on venereal disease, of all things.

03:50.898 --> 03:57.588
Because a lot of us had never, you know, we all led sheltered lives and in those days promiscuity had not been invented.

03:58.629 --> 04:03.696
And so he wanted to make sure that we knew what we were getting into if we decided to stray a little bit.

04:03.957 --> 04:09.745
And he described all the diseases in such vivid detail that none of us wanted to go close to a girl ever.

04:11.628 --> 04:12.309
What about English?

04:12.649 --> 04:13.851
We had English.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.564
Now Harrison Hurth taught one year.

04:17.584 --> 04:21.911
He taught, I took some courses from Harrison on the campus, but not my freshman year.

04:22.352 --> 04:24.997
I don't recall who my freshman English teacher was.

04:25.017 --> 04:27.120
As you look back, what was the quality of the instruction?

04:27.140 --> 04:28.162
Oh, I think it was excellent.

04:28.983 --> 04:31.027
And plus, we didn't have a lot of distractions.

04:31.287 --> 04:37.117
You know, we were either marching or playing or studying or in class.

04:37.858 --> 04:38.579
And that was it.

04:38.740 --> 04:39.501
That was our life.

04:39.650 --> 04:44.019
If you needed advice, to whom did you turn?

04:44.540 --> 04:48.548
We had tactical officers, but none of us really felt free to discuss things with them.

04:49.149 --> 04:49.911
I guess each other.

04:50.572 --> 04:55.402
I really don't recall having anyone that we could go sit down and talk over our problems with.

04:55.983 --> 04:57.085
You would have been...

04:57.183 --> 05:13.572
I know that near the end of my freshman year, of my first semester, it became evident that I was not going to make it as an engineer because of aptitude or just sheer intellectual inability or I'm not sure what.

05:13.855 --> 05:20.523
But Dean Abbott called me in and he said, you've got a good record, you're a good kid, but you're not going to make it as an engineer.

05:20.804 --> 05:23.407
He said, we need to see what else that you would be interested in.

05:24.088 --> 05:27.312
And I guess we spent almost an hour, just one-on-one.

05:28.353 --> 05:33.960
And as a result of that conversation, I switched to business administration, which is what I stayed in for the rest of my life.

05:34.781 --> 05:35.702
So it was a good choice.

05:36.263 --> 05:40.127
But he was very kind, very understanding, not threatening in any way.

05:41.009 --> 05:43.812
He wanted to do what was in my best interest.

05:44.197 --> 05:47.324
Now, where did you finish in Waco senior class?

05:47.364 --> 05:48.768
Where were you?

05:48.788 --> 05:50.452
I was in the top quarter, as I recall.

05:51.895 --> 05:55.002
And you, like I, didn't take an ACT or SAT, right?

05:55.042 --> 05:56.947
Never heard of such a thing, yeah.

05:56.967 --> 05:57.208
All right.

05:57.969 --> 06:01.277
Anything unusual in the spring semester out there?

06:02.067 --> 06:17.545
Other than my academics were so completely different, well, of course, the basics were not, but I was, I've even forgotten what courses I took that second semester, but it was almost like starting over again because the courses I'd taken in engineering didn't count

06:17.592 --> 06:20.497
So it's the end of the first semester when you make that change.

06:20.517 --> 06:21.900
That's correct.

06:21.940 --> 06:29.595
After the first semester, I switched over to business administration and took some courses on the campus that led up to that.

06:30.536 --> 06:34.624
Second semester was, after football season, it all gets kind of hazy.

06:35.205 --> 06:38.892
I remember the football season very vividly because of the trauma involved.

06:39.074 --> 06:41.517
Did you all come in for basketball games?

06:41.837 --> 06:44.420
I don't recall ever seeing a basketball game my freshman year.

06:44.440 --> 06:49.306
Did you come in for any of the silver taps?

06:49.627 --> 06:53.932
Yes, we did come in for silver taps, and of course there was no hazing there.

06:54.332 --> 06:55.494
It was all serious.

06:55.794 --> 06:56.174
Buster?

06:56.815 --> 06:57.816
Buster, we did.

07:00.520 --> 07:00.880
Bonfire?

07:01.822 --> 07:22.328
uh we had bonfire it was out in front of the uh the msc on what's now simpson drill field what did what did you fish what part of the job we we went to the woods and there was a lot of hazing in the woods as i recall and uh but we we were not allowed to spend a whole lot of time in the woods they wanted to make sure that that we were able to

07:22.814 --> 07:23.635
to do our studying.

07:23.655 --> 07:27.418
Was the bonfire constructed of timber then only?

07:27.638 --> 07:33.003
It was, much like it is now, only nowhere near as large as it became.

07:33.044 --> 07:39.469
Of course, it kept getting bigger and bigger, and then later on they had to limit the size because of the safety factors.

07:39.630 --> 07:41.431
Did you and your buddies do the cutting?

07:41.712 --> 07:41.972
Yes.

07:42.392 --> 07:42.953
Yes, we did.

07:43.794 --> 07:44.975
Using cross-cut saws?

07:45.275 --> 07:46.336
Using axes, mostly.

07:46.976 --> 07:47.197
Okay, axes.

07:47.217 --> 07:47.477
Yes.

07:48.278 --> 07:49.699
Any accidents that you remember?

07:49.966 --> 07:50.828
Not that I recall.

07:53.414 --> 07:58.887
That many people, some of whom were totally... And had never seen an axe up to that point.

07:59.228 --> 08:03.739
Of course, I cut firewood all the time when I was a kid, so I was very familiar with how to use an axe.

08:04.107 --> 08:08.092
Was there an outhouse on the top of the bonfire?

08:08.152 --> 08:08.413
Yes.

08:08.773 --> 08:09.454
Yes, there was.

08:10.215 --> 08:13.199
And in those days, they used to steal them.

08:13.219 --> 08:19.708
It was a real outhouse that they stole from someone's actual outhouse.

08:20.669 --> 08:23.793
Now, y'all did not come in for midnight yell practice the night before?

08:24.394 --> 08:26.336
No, no, we did not, that I recall.

08:26.376 --> 08:29.220
What about any of the big dances?

08:30.567 --> 08:35.933
We had a freshman ball, and it was in Cebisa.

08:35.953 --> 08:37.315
All of our dances were in Cebisa.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.917
And we had some big-name bands that came through.

08:39.938 --> 08:45.183
I remember Ray Anthony and his band, for one, that's the only one that sticks in my mind.

08:45.203 --> 08:49.708
There was a... I can't remember.

08:50.409 --> 08:50.589
No.

08:51.310 --> 08:54.634
Did you have a special date to that freshman ball?

08:57.112 --> 09:01.398
As I recall, it was a young lady from Waco that came down.

09:01.738 --> 09:06.605
They used to come down, and we'd meet and go to the dance, and then they'd go back home.

09:07.927 --> 09:09.810
And I'm trying to remember her name.

09:09.970 --> 09:11.031
Did she go back that night?

09:11.712 --> 09:14.035
Her mother brought her down, so I presume that she probably did.

09:14.055 --> 09:18.722
And the dancing started early and ended early.

09:18.762 --> 09:20.925
It was not a late-night affair.

09:22.053 --> 09:28.682
But then, of course, later on, after I got on the campus, then we had dances a lot more often.

09:28.703 --> 09:30.245
But I just recall that one dance.

09:30.545 --> 09:31.627
I call it the fish ball.

09:33.910 --> 09:34.992
Did you go to commencement?

09:37.495 --> 09:42.783
I don't remember going to commencement except, no, I don't remember going to commencement.

09:43.864 --> 09:51.435
What was the, still in this fresh year, what was the routine of conduct in the classroom?

09:51.922 --> 09:59.973
It was, I would say mostly lecture, the test.

10:00.294 --> 10:04.459
How did y'all, what were they, what was expected of you as the students?

10:05.040 --> 10:10.588
Well, we were expected to be absolutely, our deportment had to be perfect, you know, there was no toleration for

10:11.007 --> 10:12.869
for horseplay or anything of that type.

10:12.950 --> 10:13.911
It was serious business.

10:15.012 --> 10:17.235
And we were expected to have our homework.

10:17.275 --> 10:19.799
We were expected to participate in class.

10:21.140 --> 10:24.084
If we didn't, then we'd be called on, called upon.

10:25.927 --> 10:29.031
Where could you have hidden if you had wanted to cut class?

10:30.012 --> 10:32.075
Oh, I can't imagine where you could hide on that.

10:32.235 --> 10:34.298
It was a fairly barren environment.

10:34.750 --> 10:38.013
And there was a little bit of a health center?

10:38.574 --> 10:39.975
Yes, we had a health center.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.197
We called it the Quack Shack.

10:42.318 --> 10:46.302
And, of course, there were competent people there, but I don't remember.

10:46.723 --> 10:52.909
We did have one young man that developed spinal meningitis in a barracks about three or four down from me.

10:54.190 --> 11:02.479
And I'm not sure if he died or not, but it was a very serious deal, and they quarantined the barracks, and we all had to go through a lot of tests.

11:02.898 --> 11:08.504
I remember that my freshman year, during the wintertime, I developed a very bad case of flu.

11:08.564 --> 11:18.395
And I had so much congestion in my chest that mother and daddy, that was about the time the spinal meningitis deal came out.

11:18.415 --> 11:24.022
So they came and got me in with the university's permission, of course, took me to Marlin to a doctor.

11:24.062 --> 11:26.424
And I went into the hospital there and stayed about two or three days.

11:26.464 --> 11:32.331
And they determined that, no, it was just a bad case of flu with on the verge of pneumonia, but never went into pneumonia.

11:33.037 --> 11:33.798
then I came back.

11:33.838 --> 11:37.343
All right, that second semester academically went better.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.666
Much better, yeah.

11:39.686 --> 11:47.777
I was on probation as a result of flunking some courses my first semester, and I almost got off probation the second semester, but not quite.

11:48.218 --> 11:52.043
What were your parents' reaction to your first semester grades?

11:52.063 --> 11:53.064
Oh, they were heartbroken.

11:53.765 --> 11:57.570
They just couldn't understand it because I'd always been such a good student.

11:57.590 --> 11:58.892
Did they lay down any kind of

12:00.138 --> 12:01.179
you will do this?

12:01.240 --> 12:04.104
No, not really, because they knew that I was doing the best I could do.

12:04.905 --> 12:12.295
And so, no, I didn't, most of my grief was self-imposed.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.637
About what did that year cost?

12:13.657 --> 12:15.941
Do you remember?

12:15.961 --> 12:16.562
I don't recall.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.304
It was nothing almost.

12:19.105 --> 12:25.935
I remember that my sophomore year, Mother and Daddy sent me $50 a month, and I made the rest of it waiting tables and what have you.

12:25.955 --> 12:28.018
But it was not a whole lot more than that.

12:28.589 --> 12:32.057
And you didn't come on a scholarship?

12:32.579 --> 12:39.215
I took a test for the Opportunity Award Scholarship along with hundreds of other guys.

12:39.816 --> 12:45.670
That's the first time I heard the expression where the guy said, look at the guy on your left and look at the guy on your right.

12:45.970 --> 12:49.194
two out of the three of you will never graduate.

12:49.835 --> 12:53.280
You know, that was really a motivating comment, of course.

12:53.300 --> 13:00.109
But I was not awarded an Opportunity Award scholarship, so no, I had no scholarships.

13:00.129 --> 13:02.191
Okay, you go home that summer.

13:03.633 --> 13:04.915
When did the homesickness end?

13:06.517 --> 13:09.982
I guess probably by the end of my first semester, I was pretty well acclimated.

13:10.923 --> 13:14.728
I'd say almost by the end of football season, I was pretty well set up.

13:15.248 --> 13:19.574
Did you, at the end of the spring semester, did you have any thought about transferring?

13:20.074 --> 13:20.595
None at all.

13:20.895 --> 13:26.763
No, there was never any consideration that I would go anywhere with A&M and that I would graduate from A&M.

13:26.783 --> 13:32.070
All right, so you go home and come back the second year and tell me what it was like to be then on the main campus.

13:32.090 --> 13:37.397
Okay, the main campus, we were, my sophomore year, I was in B Air Force.

13:37.938 --> 13:39.079
We called it Bloody B.

13:39.751 --> 13:45.198
And I think later on they changed it, which is now Squadron 3.

13:45.999 --> 13:54.450
But the fact that I was in the Air Force on the annex just logically led me into an Air Force unit, which led to my career in the Air Force.

13:54.470 --> 14:02.400
But we were on what we call the stoop, which commonly refers to as a floor, third stoop of Durham 6, Lacey Hall.

14:02.752 --> 14:08.318
And it runs parallel to, I've forgotten the name of the street now.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.023
It's one that runs by the Corps Center.

14:12.703 --> 14:19.591
But anyway, our sophomore year, of course, we dropped a lot of the mental hazing.

14:20.452 --> 14:23.035
But then we started getting some physical hazing.

14:23.376 --> 14:25.618
Those were in those days we still had the board.

14:26.820 --> 14:32.286
And the juniors would swap the sophomores

14:32.266 --> 14:38.252
Well, the seniors would swat the juniors, and then the juniors would swat the sophomores, and it was a pretty brutal experience.

14:38.273 --> 14:40.595
It's a miracle that some of us didn't get injured.

14:43.879 --> 14:56.232
We had wooden doors on our closets, two men to a room, upper and lower bunk, and the wooden doors, every time we'd get our fannies whipped, I'd cut a notch in the door.

14:56.988 --> 14:58.870
And those were kind of badges of honor.

14:58.890 --> 15:01.613
You know, all the sophomores, how many notches you got?

15:01.653 --> 15:03.175
You know, we'd all compare notches.

15:03.675 --> 15:11.905
Well, I pretty well led the group my sophomore year because a lot of times I'd antagonize some of the other people just so I'd get an extra notch.

15:11.925 --> 15:15.068
I had 19 notches on my door at the end of my sophomore year.

15:16.229 --> 15:22.176
All right, now, normally when you get paddled, how many licks was that?

15:22.196 --> 15:25.780
Okay, they'll tap you lightly with a board, which we call warm-up licks.

15:26.317 --> 15:31.583
And I don't know the purpose of that other than they claim that it got the blood circulating or not circulating.

15:32.044 --> 15:37.250
But then you'd squat down, and the term used, you'd grab pooch.

15:38.051 --> 15:47.222
You'd grab your privates and squeeze them real tight, and then you'd stand up and squeeze your butt muscles as tightly as you could, which made it hurt less and be less likely to get injured.

15:48.183 --> 15:49.765
And then they would tap you.

15:49.825 --> 15:55.412
And then when you were ready for the three licks, there were three licks, you'd say, come through.

15:55.561 --> 15:57.964
And then they'd hit you three times with a board.

15:58.084 --> 16:03.531
And it was, you know, the boards were, you know, some of them were the length of a baseball bat.

16:03.551 --> 16:05.253
And they'd swing them as hard as they could swing them.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.055
And it was very, very painful.

16:07.135 --> 16:10.859
Our butts stayed black and blue the whole sophomore year, just about.

16:11.460 --> 16:14.323
And that eased up after the first semester of our sophomore year.

16:14.944 --> 16:19.830
Now, what were the alleged wrongs that could lead to a paddling?

16:20.671 --> 16:29.905
Well, we'd maybe be late for CQ or go down to the Coke machine during CQ and get caught, making too much noise in the hallway.

16:30.967 --> 16:38.519
Sometimes they would just paddle a whole sophomore class because the seniors had paddled the juniors, you know, and it trickled down.

16:38.699 --> 16:43.366
So we didn't want the juniors to get any paddles because we'd know that if they got it, we were going to get it.

16:44.308 --> 16:49.075
And there were two or three guys that were more notorious with the board than others.

16:49.578 --> 16:51.421
I remember there was a junior named Boyd Taylor.

16:51.902 --> 16:57.912
Everybody hated to get Boyd because he was strong and he would just pulverize you almost.

16:58.953 --> 17:07.788
But those days, when we got to be juniors, the paddling almost came to a stop because of the administration.

17:07.968 --> 17:14.539
You found out what was going on and of course it had been going on for years, years.

17:14.907 --> 17:23.140
But it periodically had outbreaks, and even later on when I was a tactical officer on the campus, my first job, we still had outbreaks of it.

17:23.841 --> 17:29.730
Now, who were the key administrators at A&M that sophomore year?

17:30.251 --> 17:32.695
Tom Harrington was our president.

17:32.715 --> 17:34.297
Now, wait, or was it Bolton?

17:36.981 --> 17:38.063
No, it was Tom Harrington.

17:38.380 --> 17:40.203
Gilchrist was the chancellor by then?

17:40.403 --> 17:41.305
I believe that's correct.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.587
Uh-huh.

17:42.607 --> 17:47.475
And Colonel Boatner was the commandant.

17:48.216 --> 17:50.439
Let's see around him.

17:50.459 --> 17:50.600
Uh-huh.

17:50.760 --> 17:57.230
Describe him physically and his manner and style.

17:58.072 --> 18:01.958
He was very stern.

18:02.512 --> 18:06.999
Not too tall, somewhat portly for a full colonel in the Army.

18:08.121 --> 18:08.863
Very gruff.

18:13.530 --> 18:20.302
To give you an example, my sophomore year I worked in the MSC in the bowling alley.

18:20.762 --> 18:25.330
I was a waiter at first and then a banquet waiter, but along with that I worked in the bowling alley.

18:25.698 --> 18:26.540
setting pins.

18:26.620 --> 18:31.632
Back in those days, we didn't have an automatic machine.

18:31.672 --> 18:32.915
We set the pins by hand.

18:33.396 --> 18:35.741
Well, I was going over one morning, and I've forgotten.

18:35.921 --> 18:42.516
As I recall, it was on a Saturday morning, which, of course, we didn't have classes at that time on Saturday morning.

18:42.577 --> 18:43.639
I didn't have any classes.

18:44.328 --> 18:52.336
Well, Colonel Boatner's house was on the corner so that I had to walk through by his front yard on the way from Durham 6 to the MSC.

18:53.757 --> 19:02.506
And he came out of the door of his house in his bathrobe and house shoes to pick up the newspaper out of the front yard as I was walking by.

19:03.607 --> 19:04.468
And I was in uniform.

19:04.488 --> 19:07.891
Of course, you never went anywhere without being out of uniform.

19:08.852 --> 19:11.635
And I passed by and I said, good morning, Colonel Boatner.

19:12.593 --> 19:14.215
And he said, cadet, come over here.

19:14.756 --> 19:16.519
And I went over and I was standing at attention.

19:16.659 --> 19:18.782
He said, do you know who I am?

19:19.002 --> 19:19.703
I said, yes, sir.

19:20.124 --> 19:20.625
Who am I?

19:21.486 --> 19:22.468
You're Colonel Boatner, sir.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.794
He said, well, don't you salute officers?

19:28.116 --> 19:29.858
And I said, yes, sir.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.020
He said, well, give me a salute.

19:31.040 --> 19:31.861
So I saluted him.

19:32.783 --> 19:35.266
And he turned around, went back in the house, and I went to the MSC.

19:35.306 --> 19:37.329
Here he's in his bathrobe, and I didn't salute him.

19:37.429 --> 19:39.833
So he kind of got on me a little bit about that.

19:40.184 --> 19:47.575
In later years, he went on to either fame or infamy, whichever you choose to call it, in a place called Koji Island.

19:48.236 --> 19:54.125
There was a prison there that he was put in charge of, and he was going to straighten it out, and he probably did would be my guess.

19:54.285 --> 19:56.268
Was he an Aggie by background?

19:56.288 --> 19:56.809
I don't know.

19:56.829 --> 19:57.830
Or a West Point?

19:57.850 --> 19:58.611
I really don't know.

19:58.652 --> 20:03.058
I've never heard anyone claim him as an Aggie.

20:03.198 --> 20:06.343
That was the only personal contact I had with him, and we really...

20:06.577 --> 20:13.027
I didn't know too much about him other than the fact that he was not a guy that you could go in and pour your heart out to.

20:13.087 --> 20:16.452
He was really a hard guy.

20:17.394 --> 20:27.690
That sophomore year, do you remember any key courses for you during that first year on the main campus?

20:27.940 --> 20:33.187
I took chemistry in high school, and I did not do well in chemistry in high school.

20:34.168 --> 20:39.996
I flunked freshman chemistry on the annex my first semester, so I was spooked about chemistry.

20:40.537 --> 20:51.251
So when I took chemistry the second semester, I was really concerned about it, but with some good help and so forth, I think I made a C or something like that.

20:51.691 --> 20:56.057
But chemistry was really the course that I really concentrated on.

20:56.037 --> 21:01.748
But all my grades started coming up my sophomore year, and then, of course, everything was fine by the time I got out.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.794
But I remember that specifically.

21:07.960 --> 21:11.446
No courses particularly stand out other than that chemistry course.

21:11.467 --> 21:19.041
You were some teachers and or advisors during the whole four years that now you look back on with gratitude.

21:19.882 --> 21:23.291
Of course, John Paul Abbott was the first one that would pop into my mind.

21:23.331 --> 21:28.785
Harrison Hearth that we mentioned earlier was a good friend.

21:28.925 --> 21:31.191
I think probably one of the people that had

21:31.762 --> 21:36.769
A lot of influence on my life was a business professor named Herb Thompson.

21:37.450 --> 21:53.593
Herb was really a great guy, and we got... He was just an excellent teacher, and he was entertaining, but he was instructive, and he demanded a lot from his students.

21:53.613 --> 21:56.236
He wanted to make sure that you understood what he was saying.

21:57.298 --> 21:59.661
And he was always real friendly.

21:59.681 --> 22:01.043
He was approachable.

22:01.748 --> 22:03.570
And I remember that very well.

22:04.451 --> 22:07.195
What about Harrison Herb, you said?

22:07.235 --> 22:09.758
Same way, just a great guy.

22:10.058 --> 22:16.606
I never did really have a whole lot of trouble with his courses, so I had no really occasion to go in and counsel with him.

22:17.047 --> 22:18.589
Did Professor Thompson have a nickname?

22:20.151 --> 22:20.972
Herb Thompson.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.073
What was his nickname?

22:22.093 --> 22:22.994
Nearly all of them did.

22:23.435 --> 22:24.716
I don't remember one for him.

22:24.736 --> 22:26.018
I don't remember one for Herb.

22:26.487 --> 22:28.129
Hearth was Harry, Happy Harry.

22:28.309 --> 22:28.629
Yes.

22:29.330 --> 22:36.416
I had a statistics prof named Hamilton, we called him Mouse Hamilton, because he was a mousy-looking little guy.

22:37.638 --> 22:40.721
And let's see.

22:40.741 --> 22:41.621
Did you have a nickname?

22:43.003 --> 22:43.543
Just Chuck.

22:43.803 --> 22:44.724
Everybody called me Chuck.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.368
And that came from earlier?

22:48.528 --> 22:54.874
There was a little Baptist preacher that called me Chuck when I was probably a freshman in high school, and it just kind of stuck.

22:55.225 --> 22:57.708
So I came to A&M with that as a nickname.

22:57.928 --> 23:01.872
And almost every A&M student had a nickname also.

23:01.932 --> 23:03.914
Pretty close, yeah, pretty close.

23:03.994 --> 23:12.203
Do you remember any now that by today's politically correct standards would not be used today?

23:13.965 --> 23:15.326
Oh my, that's a tough one.

23:15.527 --> 23:19.571
What about any of the Hispanic?

23:19.591 --> 23:21.553
Do you remember Flores, did he have a nickname?

23:24.098 --> 23:25.160
from Mexico?

23:26.481 --> 23:29.766
No, I don't recall he had a nickname.

23:29.846 --> 23:31.068
His first name was Octavio.

23:33.411 --> 23:34.994
No, I don't recall him having a nickname.

23:37.137 --> 23:38.899
Let's see.

23:39.760 --> 23:43.866
Describe a typical day of classes, a weekday of classes.

23:44.587 --> 23:48.553
Now, as a sophomore, what was the routine?

23:49.327 --> 23:57.298
We still fell out for Reveille and marched to Duncan Hall and ate together as an outfit.

23:57.879 --> 24:10.216
We had assigned tables and the seniors sat on the end and then the juniors and then the sophomores sat in the middle with the exception of the sophomore that was on what we call the hot corner.

24:12.279 --> 24:15.283
As the waiters would bring out trays of food

24:15.938 --> 24:21.083
they would hand them to the sophomore that was on the hot corner, and it was his job to pass them around.

24:21.664 --> 24:23.566
I hope, can we stop this just for a second?

24:25.828 --> 24:33.696
But then, as you mentioned earlier, all the food and utensils and so forth all had their own names.

24:33.756 --> 24:36.479
We called it slanguage.

24:37.340 --> 24:40.663
But the sophomore that was on the hot corner was responsible for

24:41.116 --> 24:44.282
making sure that all the rest of the people had the things that they wanted.

24:45.585 --> 24:54.242
And he would be the point where the waiter would hand him the, well he would lower the plate and then he would take the serving dishes off and pass them around and so forth.

24:54.262 --> 24:57.188
Now who, what sophomore got that task?

24:57.328 --> 24:57.949
It rotated.

24:58.190 --> 24:59.693
All of us had it from time to time.

25:00.173 --> 25:01.977
Now in later years,

25:03.712 --> 25:07.100
The freshmen would do that instead of the sophomores, is that right?

25:07.140 --> 25:07.862
I presume so.

25:07.882 --> 25:08.924
Yeah, that's right.

25:09.285 --> 25:09.686
That's right.

25:10.368 --> 25:11.530
Once the fish were on campus.

25:11.651 --> 25:11.931
Yes.

25:12.573 --> 25:17.805
Well, now, but even when the freshmen came on campus, as I recall,

25:18.595 --> 25:22.120
They lived over in what we call the new area, which is in the Cebiza area.

25:22.140 --> 25:24.704
They were still segregated, even though they were on campus.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.728
They were not integrated into the outfits.

25:28.470 --> 25:33.959
All right, so breakfast is 7 o'clock, and you all marched to chow?

25:34.019 --> 25:37.324
March to chow, and then dispersed from there and went our separate ways.

25:38.105 --> 25:44.535
As I recall, we were on our own for the noon meal, and then we had retreat and march to chow in the evening.

25:44.515 --> 25:48.542
And then after we finished, then we'd go our way until time for CQ.

25:48.602 --> 25:51.887
Sophomores were required to observe CQ also, 7 to 10.

25:53.290 --> 26:03.226
During the day, if you had an hour that was unscheduled, don't have a class, where was a place you could go and do whatever you wanted to do?

26:03.246 --> 26:07.754
We all headed to the sea, used the MSC, and get a Coke float.

26:08.215 --> 26:09.878
And it was comparatively new.

26:09.958 --> 26:10.759
When did it open?

26:10.891 --> 26:13.075
It opened in 1950.

26:15.339 --> 26:17.142
We were freshmen on the annex.

26:17.222 --> 26:19.667
It was just still under construction when we came here in 1949.

26:20.368 --> 26:27.921
And it was completed, as I recall, sometime in the spring or fall of 1950.

26:28.362 --> 26:31.007
So when we came back as freshmen, it was brand new.

26:31.207 --> 26:33.371
I mean, as sophomores, it was brand new.

26:33.832 --> 26:35.515
And Wayne Stark was the first director.

26:35.579 --> 26:38.242
What was your impression of the MSC?

26:38.503 --> 26:41.046
Oh, it was, you know, I'd never seen anything like it.

26:41.126 --> 26:43.308
It was a gorgeous building, still is.

26:44.229 --> 26:47.914
But the old part was just a beautiful structure.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.155
Air-conditioned.

26:49.175 --> 26:52.960
Air-conditioned, and I'd never been in very many air-conditioned buildings.

26:52.980 --> 26:54.862
We never had air conditioning when I was a kid.

26:55.463 --> 26:57.866
Twelve-foot ceilings in the houses, you didn't need it, you know.

26:58.106 --> 26:59.428
Well, at least we didn't think we needed it.

27:00.589 --> 27:02.211
And you said there was a bowling alley.

27:02.478 --> 27:06.923
Had a bowling alley and the bowling alley off to one side had a large room for ping pong.

27:07.023 --> 27:09.105
Ping pong was a big sport back in those days.

27:09.465 --> 27:11.808
Had eight lanes of bowling alley.

27:13.009 --> 27:20.697
Had a snack bar and then a little breakfast sandwich type place.

27:21.298 --> 27:25.002
And then of course we had the main ballroom where we still use it today.

27:26.263 --> 27:29.667
In your three years on the main campus,

27:30.372 --> 27:37.822
What major event, speakers, or other events do you remember in your MSC, in the MSC for you as a student?

27:37.842 --> 27:40.105
In the MSC itself?

27:40.706 --> 27:49.377
I was, my first job after I got on the campus, we were not allowed to work as freshmen, of course there's no place to work on the NX, but my first job was as a banquet waiter.

27:50.150 --> 27:55.676
We had a lady in charge of food services by the name of Theresa Tennell, and she was a, well.

27:56.436 --> 27:57.477
Spell her name, we may not.

27:57.618 --> 28:03.063
Theresa, I'm not sure how you spell that, but I believe it was T-I-N-N-E-L-L.

28:03.143 --> 28:05.025
So it's with a T. Yes, Tennell.

28:05.345 --> 28:05.786
Theresa Tennell.

28:05.806 --> 28:10.411
Theresa Tennell, and she was in charge of food services, and she reported to Wayne Stark.

28:11.572 --> 28:19.600
And so then I apparently did well enough as a banquet waiter

28:19.580 --> 28:21.342
that she offered me a job.

28:21.502 --> 28:24.024
And the coffee shop's the word I was trying to find a while ago.

28:24.045 --> 28:29.130
We had a coffee shop, a snack bar, where you got your drinks and Coke floats and that kind of stuff.

28:29.550 --> 28:37.638
And then the coffee shop, they served sandwiches and I think bacon and eggs as I recall or whatever, and maybe a noon blue plate special or something.

28:38.319 --> 28:39.921
So then I worked in there as a waiter.

28:41.382 --> 28:46.507
And of course Wayne Stark got to where he knew all of the people that worked there on a regular basis.

28:47.488 --> 28:49.350
And a job came open.

28:49.533 --> 28:51.916
in the bowling alley as a pin setter.

28:52.637 --> 28:55.500
Well, we made the same amount of money, but we got tips.

28:55.540 --> 29:00.767
They'd slide tips down the alley after you finished, nickel, dime, quarter, whatever.

29:01.388 --> 29:06.274
And so those were over and above the 50 cents an hour or whatever we were making at that time.

29:06.934 --> 29:18.088
So I left the food service operation and went to the bowling alley as a pin setter and worked there the rest of my sophomore year and probably half of my junior year.

29:18.710 --> 29:27.344
And then a desk clerk job opened up, and so then I moved up to a desk clerk in the bowling alley for the rest of my junior year and all of my senior year.

29:28.866 --> 29:34.255
How important was that work experience to you as you look back on you, your career?

29:34.454 --> 29:35.395
It was very important.

29:35.455 --> 29:36.216
I'd always worked.

29:36.236 --> 29:44.407
I had a paper route when I was 12 years old, and I'd always worked all my life, so work was nothing new to me.

29:45.068 --> 29:47.711
But I'd never worked in a business environment before.

29:47.731 --> 29:53.819
It had always been, you know, farm work or chopping cotton or picking cotton.

29:53.979 --> 29:56.783
I pick cotton a lot, and I don't ever want to do that again.

29:57.644 --> 29:59.987
But I'd never worked in a business environment.

30:00.428 --> 30:01.609
Now, waiting tables,

30:01.960 --> 30:08.247
And setting pins was labor, but there was no business equipment required there at all.

30:09.028 --> 30:14.033
But when I became a desk clerk, then I had reports to fill out, money to take care of, bank deposits to make.

30:14.554 --> 30:17.257
And that was my first exposure to those kinds of things.

30:17.297 --> 30:21.661
And it probably got me moving in the right direction.

30:22.382 --> 30:28.609
I know that you would work with him as a professional leader, but describe for this tape,

30:29.011 --> 30:33.719
Describe your impression of Wayne Stark at the time you were an undergraduate.

30:34.540 --> 30:36.424
Describe this man.

30:36.624 --> 30:42.334
I would think that he was probably someone that I would want to be like when I grew up.

30:43.095 --> 30:47.423
He had a pretty distinguished military career that most people are not aware of.

30:47.983 --> 30:50.648
As I recall, he retired as a full colonel from the reserve.

30:51.438 --> 30:52.220
Am I right there?

30:52.240 --> 30:52.961
I think so.

30:52.982 --> 30:54.244
I think he was a full colonel.

30:54.385 --> 30:59.837
But he never, you know, a lot of people wear their, they try to wear their military rank the rest of their life.

31:01.060 --> 31:05.430
And, but he was not, you know, we never even knew that he was in the military.

31:05.984 --> 31:09.131
But very gentle, very kind man, he knew everyone.

31:10.855 --> 31:17.190
I never worked for him directly, so I can't describe him as a stern taskmaster, but ran a good operation.

31:17.671 --> 31:21.480
He was very, I would think, very possessive of the MSC.

31:21.540 --> 31:24.567
He considered that his MSC.
