WEBVTT

00:01.111 --> 00:12.125
I graduated from there in 1949 and then came down 
here the following September as a freshman at A&M.

00:12.225 --> 00:17.431
But you did well enough at Waco High School to 
graduate and get accepted at A&M. Yes. I was

00:18.533 --> 00:29.947
probably in the second quarter of my class, but I'd 
been so long number one in my class in everything

00:18.533 --> 00:29.947
that I'd done that second quarter was almost a 
failure the way I'd looked at it. Yeah. Did you have

00:31.132 --> 00:33.776
favorite subjects? Did you like the science that 
you came to? No, not at all. The only thing that I

00:40.166 --> 00:43.751
liked English, I liked literature. I didn't like 
math. I didn't like science. I loved history. The

00:51.203 --> 00:57.392
only thing I liked about chemistry was that there 
was a lady that was a chemistry professor there by

00:51.203 --> 00:57.392
the name of Helen Dumont. I'll never forget her. 
I'd been, I was a junior, and I'd been in chemistry

01:00.781 --> 01:10.838
all maybe a couple months, and making B's and C's, 
you know. One day, and Helen was a very rough

01:12.561 --> 01:22.878
talking lady, you know, she was, just barked at 
everybody, and everybody was scared to death,

01:12.561 --> 01:22.878
Helen, do you mind? And so, one day she said, Okay, 
class is dismissed, but Cargill, I want to see you

01:26.060 --> 01:29.605
for a minute after class. Well, that boy, the 
adrenaline just flooded. And she said, I've been

01:32.389 --> 01:36.334
watching you. And she said, I want to ask you 
something. I said, don't you eat down in the

01:40.400 --> 01:43.284
cafeteria every day at noon? And I said, yeah, I 
sure do. And she said, you get a good balanced meal

01:45.427 --> 01:47.971
down there, don't you? I said, yes, ma'am, I sure 
do. She says, well, while you're down there in that

01:50.294 --> 01:54.700
cafeteria getting a well-balanced meal, All the 
other kids that are getting ahead by making

01:55.338 --> 02:03.952
friendships and making associations and so forth 
across the street, hamburger heaven, eating a

01:55.338 --> 02:03.952
hamburger. She said, you're a nice kid. And she 
said, I hate for you to see you clam up and stay

02:05.996 --> 02:09.161
inside of yourself. She said, I want you to get over 
there and start eating hamburgers instead of

02:09.181 --> 02:13.869
staying in the cafeteria. She said, on top of that, 
elections are coming up for some of the class

02:18.811 --> 02:21.394
officers and different things. She said, I want 
you to run for something. Well, I was literally

02:23.397 --> 02:25.419
scared to death, and she knew it. She was trying to 
pull me out of my shell. In a priority complex like

02:28.743 --> 02:35.411
you would not believe, I was literally scared in my 
own shadow because I was in such a strange

02:28.743 --> 02:35.411
environment, and she knew it. So I said, oh, I 
couldn't do that, you know. Well, to make a long

02:39.697 --> 02:43.141
story short, I did start going over and eating 
hamburgers. I did start meeting friends. And she

02:45.423 --> 02:48.787
said, now, I'm serious about you running for 
something. You come back and tell me what you want

02:48.827 --> 02:50.749
to run for. Well, at that time, we had yell leaders. 
And I never was good at sports. Didn't play

02:58.217 --> 03:02.322
football because mother didn't want me to get my 
hands hurt because I was going to be a surgeon

02:58.217 --> 03:02.322
someday. You know how that goes. But anyway, I did 
play some basketball. I was a pretty good

03:06.566 --> 03:10.471
basketball player and a real good tennis player. 
Went to a regional meet a couple of times.

03:16.102 --> 03:17.243
She called me and she said, OK. He said, what are you 
going to run for? And I said, well, I decided I want

03:19.525 --> 03:21.407
to run for . Well, at that time, my dad was a rural 
mail carrier, as I mentioned. And he had a lot of mud

03:24.990 --> 03:26.671
on his route. So he drove a four-wheel drive Jeep. 
And he had just bought him a brand new bright red

03:28.613 --> 03:31.836
fire engine red Jeep. So on the dry days, he'd carry 
the mail in his regular car. And I'd take the Jeep to

03:37.401 --> 03:39.323
drive to Waco. And we plastered campaign signs all 
over the Jeep. And I'd run around. school on my

03:44.333 --> 03:47.457
lunch hour blowing the horn and had a bunch of kids 
riding with me. And I came within just a few votes of

03:48.298 --> 03:52.644
winning the election to become yell leader. I 
didn't win, but I came so close it just really gave

03:52.804 --> 03:56.730
me a lot of good feeling. It forced me to get up on the 
stage and assembly and make some speeches and tell

03:56.770 --> 04:01.837
them why I should be the yell leader. And so it 
really helped me more than anything I can ever

04:01.897 --> 04:05.842
imagine. And I'll always be grateful to Helen 
Dumont for making me do that. That's a real boost in

04:10.488 --> 04:12.211
self-confidence. Sure enough. And I bought it. I 
need it. Then when I got to A&M, if you ever saw a

04:14.877 --> 04:19.843
melting pot, this was one. My class was the last 
class to be out at Bryan Air Force Base. Now, I don't

04:24.829 --> 04:27.412
know if you recall that or not, or if you've heard 
about it. But we lived in barracks, 20 of us, in one

04:27.612 --> 04:31.276
big open bay building. And we, of course, had an 
upper bunk and a lower bunk. A friend of mine who

04:33.799 --> 04:36.563
used to live in it, he was my bunk mate. And his name 
was Skipper McMillan. He was my closest boyhood

04:41.328 --> 04:42.910
friend. grown apart I don't even know where 
Skipper lives now but he flunked out and he kind of

04:44.493 --> 05:12.812
always I think felt that you know he didn't make it 
and I did and so I don't know if that was the wedge

04:44.493 --> 05:12.812
that separated us but he had a lot of problems with 
drinking and two or three wives and he just kind of

04:44.493 --> 05:12.812
didn't turn out the way everybody hoped that he 
would but anyway came here as a freshman spent my

04:44.493 --> 05:12.812
freshman year out of Bryan Air Force Base then came 
to the campus was over in dorm six as a sophomore.

05:17.242 --> 05:19.385
Loved the Corps, loved everything about the 
Corps. We're going to get to that. OK. I want to ask

05:21.168 --> 05:25.554
you about the time that you were ready to graduate 
from high school. Your mom wants you to be a

05:26.315 --> 05:28.619
physician. Did you have aims? Did you have goals? 
Was there something that you wanted? I wanted to be

05:34.247 --> 05:40.656
a doctor, primarily because she wanted me to be, 
right up until my graduation in high school. Well,

05:40.855 --> 05:44.299
that brings the question, then, why did you come to 
Texas A&M? Because almost all of the generals I've

05:44.940 --> 05:51.027
talked to wanted to be an engineer, or some of them 
business. But almost all of them want to be

05:51.747 --> 05:53.369
engineers. And most people who wanted to be 
physicians either went to Baylor or to the

05:53.469 --> 05:59.476
University of Texas. I had an uncle, Thomas Elijah 
Cole. And Uncle Tommy went to A&M. He graduated in

06:08.066 --> 06:09.748
1938. And the whole family thought A&M was just a 
super place. And I'm not sure that it ever really

06:14.798 --> 06:20.828
dawned on Mother that if you wanted to be a doctor, 
you did not come to A&M at that time. And so we just

06:22.050 --> 06:28.280
always kind of assumed that someday I was going to 
come to A&M. But I think as after I got to Waco High

06:28.300 --> 06:36.293
School, and I did so poorly in biology, did so 
poorly in chemistry, did so poorly in a lot of my

06:28.300 --> 06:36.293
other subjects, that mother realized that 
probably I would never be a doctor so then she

06:37.758 --> 06:43.845
really started pushing the A&M bit. She didn't 
have to push very hard because I've always been

06:44.626 --> 06:48.451
inclined toward the military. I think a lot of that 
stemmed from my intense interest in the Second

06:49.192 --> 06:55.419
World War. Ok, that's another question I wanted to 
ask. Why and how did you get interested in the

06:58.122 --> 07:01.386
military? I was a paper boy. I started carrying the 
paper when I was 12 years old, which was maybe in 31,

07:02.913 --> 07:06.838
41. That would be 1943, which was at the height of 
the war. And as I would fold papers, I would read the

07:11.684 --> 07:17.251
headlines and would read the paper intently. Of 
course, during those days, we had no television,

07:17.271 --> 07:22.297
but the radio was so real. And the newscasters 
would come on, and I'd always listen to the news

07:23.298 --> 07:27.003
reports on the war. Sit in Dad's lap or by him, and 
we'd all listen to the news reports. And I

07:32.129 --> 07:38.618
developed an intense interest in that, plus the 
fact that I was always very active in the Boy

07:32.129 --> 07:38.618
Scouts. Dad was a scoutmaster, and I was in a little 
country town like that. All the kids in town were in

07:44.987 --> 07:46.569
the Boy Scouts. And we'd go out on camping. We had 
uniforms, and I was proud of my uniform. And I

07:50.294 --> 07:57.103
excelled and did well in the Boy Scouts and only 
became a life scout. I never made Eagle. I ran out of

07:59.106 --> 08:00.668
time before I I had to get involved in other things. 
But in any event, the wearing of the uniform and

08:03.060 --> 08:08.545
keeping my shoes shiny, it just appealed to me. And 
so I would say that the thing that really whetted my

08:09.586 --> 08:24.419
interest in getting me to A&M were really two 
things, the Boy Scouts and the affinity for the

08:09.586 --> 08:24.419
wearing of the uniform and the Second World War. 
The Second World War had a tremendous impact on me.

08:30.533 --> 08:35.239
And how else besides getting you to A&M?

08:37.021 --> 08:42.388
The realization that, well, there was a certain 
beauty in the teamwork involved. It fascinated me

08:44.251 --> 08:52.061
how millions of people could be involved in a 
conflict with a common goal. And that fascination

08:54.404 --> 08:56.867
was not limited to just our side. I had a tremendous 
respect for the for the German army, for example,

08:59.086 --> 09:01.709
and some of the German generals. And I'm not sure if 
I had it at that time or if I've developed it since

09:02.310 --> 09:08.658
then and through historical readings and 
different things.

09:12.362 --> 09:22.775
But the beauty of an organization and men marching 
in columns, you've probably detected by now I'm

09:12.362 --> 09:22.775
very emotional about some things. And for 
example, Stars and Stripes Forever is a song that

09:28.297 --> 09:32.242
always chokes me up. I don't know why, because it 
conjures up visions of vast armies marching, all

09:32.262 --> 09:40.631
with a common goal. It's just something almost 
spiritual.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.682
What did you ever consider West Point? I never 
really did, and I don't know why. I really don't

09:55.649 --> 09:56.650
know why. I guess unless I just felt that that was so 
far beyond reality that it was just too much to hope

09:56.798 --> 10:03.465
for. But

10:05.047 --> 10:15.559
once I got to A&M, then the Corps continued to 
emphasize some of the feelings that I'd already

10:05.047 --> 10:15.559
had before I got here. So one main reason you'd say 
for coming to A&M was because of the Corps? Yes.

10:21.806 --> 10:25.270
Because it was here so you could participate in a 
military organization? Of course, the Corps and

10:25.604 --> 10:29.269
the University were one at that time. It was 
mandatory. Everybody was in the Corps. So in other

10:31.913 --> 10:35.177
words, if you came to A&M, you bought the package 
deal. You had no choices. Either you came to A&M

10:37.160 --> 10:42.387
100% in the Corps, militarily oriented, or you 
went somewhere else. But I would say a combination

10:43.148 --> 10:51.780
of my uncle's influence, since he was an Aggie, He 
had polio when he was a young man, and he was

10:52.132 --> 10:56.739
crippled. But even then, they would let people who 
were physically disabled in the Corps, they would

10:56.759 --> 11:02.729
not give them commissions. Just like today, we 
have drill and ceremony excuses. And I don't know

11:05.974 --> 11:10.161
if you noticed or not, but they're the guys that 
wear the A&M patch on both shoulders. They don't

11:10.201 --> 11:16.030
have an Air Force or an Army patch on their left 
shoulder. No, I didn't notice that. That's

11:17.370 --> 11:17.971
interesting. Those people, if you see an A&M patch 
on both shoulders, that's what they call a drill

11:18.051 --> 11:23.735
and ceremony, or a DNC student. It means they're 
just in the Corps because they want to be. They're

11:26.698 --> 11:28.259
not going to be a commissioned officer. And so he 
was in that category. I'm not sure they called it

11:33.304 --> 11:36.246
that at that time, but he was in that category. And I 
was very fond of my uncle. He's since deceased. But

11:42.372 --> 11:45.274
that, coupled with the fact that I wanted to be in 
the military, I wanted the commission. Well, the

11:48.024 --> 11:49.846
A&M was a logical choice. Sure. Now, when you got 
here, was it the first time you ever came to A&M?

11:57.053 --> 11:58.174
When you got off that train. Did you get off the 
train over here at the old station? No. Or did your

12:00.897 --> 12:02.899
parents drive you down there? My father drove me 
down. And at that time, we came up South College.

12:08.624 --> 12:16.392
Texas Avenue, I'm not even sure existed, because 
South College was the main connecting highway

12:08.624 --> 12:16.392
between Bryan and College Station, and was the 
main highway at that time. and it branched off and

12:17.063 --> 12:21.329
went to Welborn down on to Houston. But the first 
time I saw the college was we were coming to South

12:21.349 --> 12:31.763
College, and you could see the administration 
building, the present systems administration

12:21.349 --> 12:31.763
building on the horizon. And that was the first 
time I ever saw it when I came down here as a

12:31.783 --> 12:36.869
freshman, or to register to become a freshman. And 
it was quite a sight. It was then and is now. What did

12:43.498 --> 12:45.501
you think of the conditions when you got here? The 
course of living out, for example, living out at

12:46.915 --> 12:51.320
the airport. Keep in mind that this is a very 
unusual time for A&M. That's right. It really was.

12:56.706 --> 12:58.588
Mine was the last class out there. Mine was the last 
class out there. And out of that class came a lot of

13:01.091 --> 13:06.377
people that are still connected with the 
university in a very heavy way. Dean Cooper, our

13:06.437 --> 13:11.262
registrar, for example, Bill Preston, our state 
representative, and just on and on. Lots of people

13:11.302 --> 13:13.184
that were in that class. And we all shared those 
experiences together. I really never saw very

13:17.324 --> 13:23.692
much of the main campus until I was a sophomore, 
with one exception. And that is when they bust us in

13:23.992 --> 13:26.395
to go to football games. And that was terrible, 
because that's when we really, the upperclassmen

13:26.555 --> 13:32.182
had a shot at it from a hazing standpoint. And 
hazing then, and I'm not sure, I can't speak

13:32.202 --> 13:41.573
authoritatively now, but hazing in that time was 
intense during the football games. So we hated

13:41.593 --> 13:43.095
football games. But once we got back out to Bryan 
Air Force Base, then there was a relatively small

13:43.700 --> 13:49.765
amount of it because there were no upperclassmen 
out there. Occasionally, some renegades would

13:50.446 --> 13:53.468
come out and raise a lot of cane. There was some of 
that. But I remember the freshman year as being a

13:55.090 --> 14:02.656
very enjoyable, interesting year. And we did a lot 
of things for amusement, football in a muddy field

14:03.056 --> 14:13.285
where everybody got muddy and marching to chow. 
seeing the movies on weekends. I mentioned to you

14:18.282 --> 14:24.894
earlier, I was a very poor student because I just 
didn't like to study is my thing. And I didn't do

14:24.914 --> 14:25.815
very much. Well, I did quite a bit of it. I've 
started off as a petroleum engineering major.

14:30.824 --> 14:31.425
Because That's what the guy in line in front of me 
decided he was going to take, and that sounded good

14:31.928 --> 14:39.058
to me, who was Skipper McMillan, this guy I was 
mentioning to you. I said, boy, Skipper, that

14:39.078 --> 14:40.781
sounds good to me. If that's good enough for you, 
it's good enough for me. Well, I immediately

14:42.383 --> 14:44.566
flunked everything I was taking just about. And 
John Paul Abbott, who's still around campus, Dean

14:45.568 --> 14:57.565
Abbott, as we call him, he was the head academic, 
well, he was the head guy with academics on the NX.

14:59.063 --> 15:02.729
And he called me into the office and he told me, he 
said, it doesn't look like you're ever going to be

14:59.063 --> 15:02.729
an engineer. And I said, yes, sir, I know. And so he 
said, well, we need to change your major. What

15:08.338 --> 15:08.959
would you like? And so at that time, you know, it was 
engineering or agriculture or maybe something

15:09.820 --> 15:15.949
called business administration. So I said, let me 
try business administration. And so then, of

15:19.134 --> 15:27.147
course, I went ahead and got my degree in business 
administration and my master's in marketing and

15:19.134 --> 15:27.147
rather my undergraduate degree was in marketing 
and my master's degree was in management,

15:27.380 --> 15:35.073
organization and management. And then I took some 
courses beyond the master's level just to gain

15:35.093 --> 15:39.000
some knowledge. I took some accounting courses 
primarily. Never had any intention of pursuing a

15:41.705 --> 15:45.111
Ph.D. program. Now this is a really unusual 
situation for A&M because you have veterans still

15:45.872 --> 15:51.582
on you still had, I would imagine, a few veterans 
left from the Second World War who were just about

15:52.000 --> 16:01.832
ready to finish up, came back in 45 and 46, and 
enrolled. And there are civilians, and some of

16:02.253 --> 16:07.980
them were even in the Corps. And then you also have 
some teenage Corps kids. How did everybody get

16:12.706 --> 16:15.208
along? Fine, basically because they had a 
veteran's outfit. The veterans were not lined in

16:18.071 --> 16:23.196
with the regular undergraduate corps, the 
younger guys. They had their own outfit. They

16:24.718 --> 16:27.761
could be civilians, couldn't they, if they wanted 
to? If they wanted to. I mean, they did not have to be

16:28.462 --> 16:29.643
in the corps. That's right. That's correct. But 
all of the... And some of them, of course, are

16:31.665 --> 16:36.429
married and have families, too. Yes, that's 
right. But all of the guys in the... The outfits,

16:42.963 --> 16:46.907
that was your family away from home. And even 
though you had a mixture of seniors, juniors,

16:46.927 --> 16:55.675
sophomores, and then, of course, later on 
freshmen,

16:46.927 --> 16:55.675
you looked out for each other. And the outfits were 
very close. To this day, we have outfit reunions.

17:01.380 --> 17:06.404
And those are my closest friends, the guys that we 
were in the same outfit together. And of course,

17:06.425 --> 17:11.089
the whole school was relatively small at that time 
compared to now. And so you knew a lot of people. But

17:13.591 --> 17:17.958
we had no problems with the older veterans, 
because they kind of went their own way. And of

17:18.058 --> 17:25.389
course, those that were in the Corps, they would 
march in their outfit, and they would be in the

17:18.058 --> 17:25.389
parades and what have you. But they weren't 
intermingled with the rest of the Corps. I'm

17:31.278 --> 17:40.071
always interested in when someone who becomes a 
vice president and a general, when did they start

17:31.278 --> 17:40.071
their leadership? When did they feel like they 
were beginning a role of leadership? When was that

17:43.856 --> 17:44.677
for you? Was it here at A&M, or was it when you ran for 
Yale leader back in high school? I think that was,

17:50.086 --> 18:06.193
well, I would have to say that when I finished my 
sophomore year,

17:50.086 --> 18:06.193
let's see, no, when I finished elementary school, 
and I was the valedictorian of my class, was the

18:06.646 --> 18:11.231
first time I'd ever excelled and felt that I was a 
leader among my peers. Then my Boy Scout work

18:12.532 --> 18:18.239
emphasized that to some degree.

18:20.902 --> 18:30.492
The yell leader instance that I told you about in 
high school was another thing that added emphasis

18:20.902 --> 18:30.492
to the fact that I possibly had some leadership 
potential. I would say at A&M, Near the middle of my

18:37.038 --> 18:40.223
sophomore year, I was selected as a corporal. And 
there were only about three or four in the whole

18:41.665 --> 18:44.248
outfit. And that gave me some good feels, good 
vibes. I'd say in the early days, those were the

18:49.596 --> 18:56.125
events that stand out in my mind.

18:58.629 --> 19:06.640
In later years, I belonged to an organization 
called Toastmasters that did an awful lot for me as

18:58.629 --> 19:06.640
far as self-image, and of course, as you know, 
being in a job I have here as well as in the military,

19:07.548 --> 19:25.348
I have to make a lot of presentations, do a lot of 
speaking in front of not only large groups of

19:07.548 --> 19:25.348
people in some cases, but with very high-ranking 
people in some places. And so even though you never

19:26.429 --> 19:31.454
completely get rid of the butterflies, you don't 
want to get rid of all of them. You just teach them to

19:31.474 --> 19:33.977
fly in formations, what else to do. And so I give 
Toastmasters credit for an awful lot of my

19:34.666 --> 19:43.499
success, if you can say I've had any. And basically 
the role of Toastmasters is for people to give

19:43.519 --> 19:48.125
different talks. Yes, right. It's 
self-improvement through public speaking. And

19:53.753 --> 19:55.015
it works. It really works. So in other words, a role 
of leadership for you has been a gradual one. There

20:03.843 --> 20:04.905
was never just one. Some people in World War II told 
me, well, I just had to stand up and throw that hand

20:04.945 --> 20:11.513
grenade at the people. No, nothing that dramatic 
in my case. It's just been an evolving type of

20:14.416 --> 20:16.359
thing. It's just happened. Which is how it is with 
most people. OK, now let's talk about, you

20:20.397 --> 20:22.760
mentioned this before. This is something I am 
eager to talk about with former students, and that

20:23.261 --> 20:29.590
is the hazing. You said there was plenty of hazing 
when you came to the football field. What kind was

20:33.475 --> 20:34.517
it? And I'm particularly interested in the 
difference between mental and physical hazing.

20:40.005 --> 20:45.753
And also the question, what good did it do? What 
purpose did it serve? Yes, OK. To begin with, I've

20:50.114 --> 20:53.538
seen hazing from two different aspects. I've seen 
it as a student while I was a student here. And then

20:56.501 --> 21:08.113
as you get into my resume, you'll see that after I 
was out of school for a while, after I was off the

20:56.501 --> 21:08.113
military, then I came back and my first job at Texas 
A&M was as what we call a tactical officer,

20:56.501 --> 21:08.113
commonly referred to as a bull. I was a counselor. I 
wore my uniform by the virtue of the fact that I was

21:10.576 --> 21:19.345
in the reserve, not on active duty, but still I 
habitually wore the uniform all day every day. had

21:19.747 --> 21:21.710
my office down in the dormitory area. So I was able 
to see hazing from the guy's standpoint that was

21:21.850 --> 21:27.858
trying to prevent it and to eliminate it, more 
heavy. So let me start off with the student aspect

21:27.878 --> 21:33.046
of it first.

21:34.748 --> 21:41.297
We had been at the annex in the dormitory, in the 
barracks, I'd say maybe a week.

21:44.402 --> 21:49.669
We had heard all kinds of horror stories about the 
hazing and the boarding and the different things.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.982
90% of which weren't true. We thought they were at 
the time. I'll never forget one night about 3

21:54.565 --> 22:01.653
o'clock, about 2.30 in the morning, in the 
barracks next to us, there was the oldest

21:54.565 --> 22:01.653
commotion you've ever heard. You know, guys 
yelling and screaming and hollering in

22:01.753 --> 22:06.819
wastebaskets being thrown up and down the aisles. 
Well, somebody started the rumor in the back of the

22:07.560 --> 22:16.230
barracks, and keep in mind that there were 20 of us 
in this big open bay barracks, that the upper

22:07.560 --> 22:16.230
classmen were over next door hazing. Well, we were 
literally scared to death. We weren't about to

22:18.643 --> 22:21.487
turn on the light or stick our heads out or anything 
else. Well, as it worked out, the upperclassmen

22:22.188 --> 22:24.671
weren't anywhere near. The next morning, some of 
the freshmen had gone out and gotten a bunch of beer

22:24.731 --> 22:30.217
and gotten drunk, and they were coming in raising 
their own cane. But anyway, for me to remember

22:31.038 --> 22:35.844
that, that made such a tremendous impact on me. So 
the point I'm trying to make is the hazing was not

22:36.365 --> 22:42.792
anywhere near as bad as the anticipation of it. The 
fear of it. The fear of it, yeah. But the hazing my

22:46.028 --> 22:51.376
freshman year was entirely mental hazing. By 
that, there are little rituals that you go

22:52.718 --> 23:01.230
through, and they do even today, of introducing 
yourself in a certain manner. I'm sure you've

23:01.470 --> 23:03.213
probably seen that little routine. They call it 
whipping out, where you whip out and stand in

23:03.393 --> 23:06.718
detention. The guy puts you in a brace and sucks in 
your gut and your chin and all that kind of stuff.

23:11.184 --> 23:13.047
There were a lot of little things that we had to 
memorize. For example, you couldn't say, I do not

23:13.407 --> 23:15.310
know. you had to recite the little speech that went 
along with it, which I can do until this minute

23:16.015 --> 23:24.489
after all these years.

23:25.591 --> 23:36.650
But it was basically, I was raised in an 
environment, and a lot of us were, where the proper

23:25.591 --> 23:36.650
conduct was to be gentle to people and to be very 
considerate of the other person's feelings. You

23:37.391 --> 23:40.757
never raised your voice if there was any other way 
to do it. then suddenly you're thrown in an

23:41.227 --> 23:56.085
environment where a sophomore with his hat pulled 
down all over his face gets right up in your face

23:41.227 --> 23:56.085
with a cigar which is blowing smoke in your face and 
just yelling at you and telling you how stupid you

23:41.227 --> 23:56.085
are and how insignificant you are. It takes a lot of 
adjustment. But if you know it's coming and you

23:59.208 --> 24:10.542
know you've got some peers in the same boat, it 
develops a certain amount of toughness about you.

24:10.741 --> 24:36.445
allows you after you've been into it for a while to 
to tune the guy out and say he's not really talking

24:10.741 --> 24:36.445
to me you know if he wants to make an ass of himself 
then that's his problem it's not my problem he's

24:10.741 --> 24:36.445
the guy that's got the problem not me we had one guy 
that and this went on to some extent even when we

24:10.741 --> 24:36.445
were sophomores because when we were on the annex 
our freshman year we didn't They didn't have that

24:37.167 --> 24:38.850
much of a shot at us. So our second year, the hazing 
did take the form of boardings. Now, usually a

24:47.164 --> 24:53.595
boarding, I don't know if you've ever seen one of 
the boards we use or not, but it's a weapon. It's a

24:53.996 --> 24:54.577
weapon. That's what it is. And usually... they 
didn't get out the board for one guy. They'd have

25:03.709 --> 25:09.396
boarding sessions where they'd get all the 
sophomores in and give them licks. Usually the

25:10.357 --> 25:21.771
ritual went along the lines that they'd get you in, 
make sure they had plenty of room to swing the

25:10.357 --> 25:21.771
board, move the beds, furniture, what have you. 
Then the expression they used was to grab pooch.

25:25.688 --> 25:36.441
That meant that you reached down and grabbed 
yourself so that you wouldn't get anything

25:25.688 --> 25:36.441
injured, pull that up out of the way, and then you'd 
tighten the muscles in your rear so that it

25:25.688 --> 25:36.441
wouldn't hurt you as bad. And at that time, very few 
of us had any fat on us. It was just nearly all

25:40.245 --> 25:41.346
muscle. But when the board would hit, and they'd 
swing it as hard as they could, just like a

25:41.947 --> 25:49.716
baseball, it would bounce almost like it was 
hitting a piece of, You'd get three licks at a time.

25:56.468 --> 26:02.116
And they'd be so intense that your rear would just 
turn red and then sometimes white and then blue and

25:56.468 --> 26:02.116
purple. And it was really a bad situation. But it 
wasn't so bad that anyone that I knew ever got

26:05.220 --> 26:14.353
injured permanently with it, although I'm sure 
that there are cases where there have been some

26:05.220 --> 26:14.353
permanent injuries. But then after a while, we got 
to where we would almost antagonize

26:15.667 --> 26:22.458
upperclassmen just to show them that we could take 
anything they could dish out. Well, I had a wooden

26:23.540 --> 26:28.368
door in my closet, and most of us kept score either 
on a chair arm or on a wooden door. Well, every time

26:29.030 --> 26:33.577
I'd get my fanny beat, well, I'd go carve a notch on 
my door. Well, the notches on my door in room 305

26:33.657 --> 26:37.624
would arm six. became kind of a badge of honor. If 
somebody came and said, how many Nazis you got now?

26:43.866 --> 26:45.568
Boy, and I'd open the door and I'd show them with 
pride. I got 12 or 13. Each one stood for an

26:46.869 --> 26:50.573
individual boarding. That was all my sophomore 
year. Never had it hand on me my freshman year nor

26:52.816 --> 26:56.440
after my sophomore year. But it all happened my 
sophomore year. And near the end of our sophomore

26:59.463 --> 27:05.029
year, the authorities started clamping down on it 
and then it pretty well went away. But that was I

27:11.094 --> 27:20.708
didn't really see too much benefit in the physical 
hazing. Other than the fact to teach you that you

27:21.409 --> 27:27.437
can accept a certain amount of pain without caving 
in. And I would think that maybe in a prisoner of war

27:33.713 --> 27:41.742
situation where there's some degree of torture, 
that that might precondition you to some extent,

27:33.713 --> 27:41.742
although I've never been in a situation like that. 
But I have been in a situation many times, and

27:42.523 --> 27:49.031
recently, where I was under intense emotional 
pressure. And I always think back, even, you know,

27:51.474 --> 27:56.720
I use it as a crutch, but that's fine, you know, as 
far as I'm concerned. I always think back that no

27:57.460 --> 28:01.425
matter what those guys say to me or no matter what 
they can do to me, They couldn't possibly be as bad

28:01.743 --> 28:07.430
as Stanley Rosenthal was when I was a freshman and 
he was a sophomore, chewing on me. Nothing they

28:07.451 --> 28:10.334
could do to be that bad, and I took that. So once you 
accept that the worst that could possibly happen

28:11.396 --> 28:22.570
to you is not all that bad, then you go ahead and you 
almost kind of get tickled a little bit, and you

28:11.396 --> 28:22.570
chuckle about the situation. So in other words, 
you don't see much purpose for the physical

28:22.590 --> 28:27.477
hazing, but you do for the mental hazing. Yes. Yes, 
I do. It develops gradually. It develops a mental

28:30.059 --> 28:40.810
toughness that you've just got to have to be in some 
of the situations that I've found myself in and

28:30.059 --> 28:40.810
will find myself in in the coming years. Maybe it 
performs some of the same duty as the type of hazing

28:42.532 --> 28:52.022
you get in any boot camp situation. Exactly. It's a 
mental conditioning to accept adverse

28:53.523 --> 28:58.108
situations. You can't go through life looking for 
the tranquil way out all the time. And you try to get

29:05.505 --> 29:12.391
things done as nicely and as gently as possible, 
but you can't always do that. And so I don't ever

29:13.752 --> 29:16.634
mean to be insubordinate. I mean, I'm a very strong 
believer in subordination. It's the only way any

29:19.837 --> 29:22.259
system's going to work is through subordination. 
But if you get to the point where you can't accept

29:23.480 --> 29:28.905
the boss's instructions, then it's time to resign 
and go somewhere else. But I've always been very

29:29.813 --> 29:39.466
fortunate in that I've always had good bosses and 
people that I've respected and, for the most part,

29:29.813 --> 29:39.466
have agreed wholeheartedly with their programs. 
But I will say that the mental hazing was, I have no

29:40.408 --> 29:49.701
problems with mental hazing. I think that it's a 
positive thing, although it may be hard to see at

29:49.761 --> 29:53.786
the time. I'm all for it. By the same token, I think 
that physical hazing serves no useful purpose. It

30:00.256 --> 30:01.658
really doesn't. And when you came back later as a 
reserve officer, did you attempt to get rid of this

30:01.678 --> 30:09.788
physically? Yes, and we pretty well had it clamped 
down. There were a number of us that were involved

30:12.291 --> 30:21.283
in that aspect of the thing, and it was rare, I feel, 
when we had anyone that did any physical hazing.

30:21.303 --> 30:23.726
But mental hazing, of course, went on all the time. 
And with our knowledge, and as long as it didn't get

30:23.746 --> 30:28.272
out of hand, we felt that it was a positive thing. 
Just like today, they don't try to restrict the

30:29.483 --> 30:39.475
kids from yelling at a freshman, but just don't 
touch him. That's the thing. OK. There's a couple

30:42.398 --> 30:47.584
I've heard just from various sources. These might 
be rumors, and therefore I wanted just to, since

30:47.644 --> 30:54.713
you were on the scene at the time, I want to sort of 
try to clarify this. One was I heard that. The

30:58.846 --> 31:11.237
reason why they put people in the airport area, the 
freshmen in the airport area, was not just because

30:58.846 --> 31:11.237
of overcrowding with the veterans coming back, 
but was because the hazing had got so bad.

31:12.738 --> 31:19.944
Therefore, they wanted to separate the new 
freshmen from the three other classes. I don't

31:20.365 --> 31:22.006
believe there's anything to that at all. I 
honestly don't. I've never had any indication

31:24.408 --> 31:28.752
that that was even a remote reason for us being 
there. And another thing is I've heard from

31:32.969 --> 31:49.483
various A&M graduates that they're the

31:32.969 --> 31:49.483
most Aggie or the most die-hard Aggies. The former 
students were those who graduated in the 50s

31:50.404 --> 31:58.992
before this university became of Coed University 
and when it was still an A&M college. What do you

32:04.984 --> 32:05.744
think about that? Now they'd probably say the most 
conservative Aggies. I would tend to say that if I

32:13.093 --> 32:17.638
had to say yes or no, that I would say yes. Of course, 
that, like everything else, is a shade of gray. But

32:22.143 --> 32:28.270
I would say that as far as what we call Aggie spirit, 
almost fanatical defense of the university,

32:30.865 --> 32:41.561
defense of each other, sticking together. I've 
seen it. I've been here for 23 years on the staff

32:45.707 --> 32:50.514
and, of course, as a student before that.

32:53.358 --> 32:55.842
There's a lot of spirit here now, but it's a 
different kind of spirit. It's not fanatical.

32:57.424 --> 32:59.387
It's a more reasoned spirit. It's something that 
you do because you want to, whereas in our case,

33:00.110 --> 33:06.920
when we started out, we had no choice. But then we 
got to where we didn't want a choice. It was almost a

33:10.404 --> 33:16.653
type of brainwashing, I'd say. But it was a 
welcomed, positive time. I would say yes, that I

33:22.321 --> 33:30.032
would have to agree with your initial statement, 
that back in those days when it was all core, all

33:22.321 --> 33:30.032
mandatory core, There was a closer group, 
probably to some extent because it was a smaller

33:30.957 --> 33:52.738
group, but we all were pretty well out of the same 
mold, very conservative,

33:30.957 --> 33:52.738
a lot of patriotism, a lot of feeling of pride when 
the flag went by. And I'm sure that those feelings

33:52.758 --> 33:59.665
still exist, but they're just not as open and as 
apparent now as they were then. I will say that I

34:02.429 --> 34:17.144
think probably our students now are a lot smarter,

34:02.429 --> 34:17.144
have a lot more potential than a lot of our group did 
because of the fact that they're better rounded

34:02.429 --> 34:17.144
people. We had a pretty narrow upbringing, and 
we'll never overcome that. I'm not sure it's a

34:23.351 --> 34:25.453
disadvantage, but it's a fact. And of course, you 
have to deal with this all the time in your position

34:27.555 --> 34:30.618
today. Oh, yeah. I'm probably have a broader 
perspective than most because of the fact that I

34:32.585 --> 34:39.660
have been here for so long. And I deal with a lot of 
young people. And seen the change. Yes. And I've

34:44.511 --> 34:50.644
accepted the change much more readily than 
someone that, say, graduated from here and then

34:44.511 --> 34:50.644
went off somewhere. But I've had no problems 
accepting the changes. I think they've all been

34:55.185 --> 34:56.447
positive. And that, of course, goes right with my 
initial question that the people who are the most

34:56.687 --> 35:06.055
against many of the changes of the 1960s were those 
graduates in the 50s. This is the generalization I

35:06.236 --> 35:08.157
heard. Whereas the people who graduated in 
another very important decade for this

35:08.758 --> 35:19.888
university, the 30s, and then who became general 
officers later on after the Second World War,

35:21.185 --> 35:33.171
Those people have really broadened it in a very 
different way, and yes, they had the same old

35:21.185 --> 35:33.171
spirit, but they didn't have what you said, what 
the fanaticism of those people of the 50s. Why do

35:33.251 --> 35:39.244
you think there is such a difference in the 30s 
generation graduates versus the versus the 50s.

35:41.211 --> 35:49.505
And then, of course, since we've opened the door, 
there's an entirely new idea of the graduates

35:41.211 --> 35:49.505
today. I'd say the people graduating in the 70s are 
much more receptive to change. Why is that? Why are

35:56.415 --> 35:58.879
those 50 people that way? I don't know, unless we 
were all Of course, all being in the same age group,

36:01.567 --> 36:18.848
we were all formed by the same pressures, the 
influence of the Depression, the influence of the

36:01.567 --> 36:18.848
Second World War, the influence of a time when 
family authority was intense most places. You

36:19.569 --> 36:21.091
didn't question parental authority. That was 
just a given. Whereas nowadays, I would suspect

36:23.153 --> 36:28.840
that there's more questioning of In other words, I 
wouldn't dream of asking my daddy why if he told me

36:29.242 --> 36:34.127
to do something, even today. But the kids nowadays 
want to know why. They won't accept something just

36:40.372 --> 36:44.536
on face value because I say so. And I think that's 
probably healthy, as long as it doesn't get out of

36:44.556 --> 36:48.920
bounds. But I think that probably the reason is 
that we all shared a lot of very emotional,

37:00.342 --> 37:04.873
common occurrences through the Depression, 
through the Second World War. I don't think

37:05.755 --> 37:14.437
there's any way that you can place the impact that 
the Second World War had on the life of people in my

37:05.755 --> 37:14.437
age group. What about the period after the Second 
World War? I'm not trying to put words in your

37:17.150 --> 37:35.962
mouth, but the period after the Second World War, 
in which we thought we had won, and then we felt so

37:17.150 --> 37:35.962
disillusioned by 1947 when Eastern Europe had 
that dictatorship just being replaced by another

37:17.150 --> 37:35.962
one, Nazis versus the Communists. It can't help 
but contribute to a lot of frustration. And Korea,

37:39.928 --> 37:41.571
leading to Korea. You know, we were all the big 
slogan going around that this is the war to end all

37:41.821 --> 37:47.109
wars. And then it became very evident very shortly 
that that was not the case, nor is it likely to ever

37:48.030 --> 37:53.418
be the case during our lifetime. It just leads you 
to the conclusion that our way of life is worth

37:55.420 --> 38:01.489
defending, and we'll do that. OK, let's go to 
another issue, and that is the Corps itself. I need

38:09.715 --> 38:11.037
to take a little break. You want to walk down the 
hall a minute? I'm interested in a question that I

38:13.942 --> 38:23.698
ask all the generals, and I always get a lot of 
different remarks on this one. Was that a yes on

38:23.718 --> 38:25.101
another coat? Yes. Please. And that is, what did 
you like and what did you dislike about being in the

38:27.044 --> 38:34.356
Corps?

38:39.179 --> 38:44.606
At the time, I disliked the hazing, all parts of the 
hazing. In retrospect, as I mentioned earlier, I

38:44.626 --> 38:58.424
think that the positive aspects of the metal 
hazing far outweighed any temporary

38:44.626 --> 38:58.424
inconvenience. Other than that, I don't know of 
anything that I disliked about the core. I liked

39:02.369 --> 39:03.451
everything about it. I liked the drilling. I liked 
the regimentation of living by the clock. I like

39:10.336 --> 39:13.720
the call to quarters when you're required to 
study. I like the inspections. I like keeping my

39:15.482 --> 39:17.525
uniform sharp. I like the line of authority that 
you had between, in other words, the chain of

39:19.107 --> 39:30.941
command up through your commander. I still do. I 
think that probably had a lot to do with my interest

39:33.044 --> 39:37.329
in management and organizational structure. 
Sure. And the fact that it's so important

39:38.191 --> 39:51.747
to stick to some of the real basics and unity of 
command and things like that. One of the things

39:52.729 --> 40:01.279
that I think is wrong with part of our university 
operation and systems operation right now is that

39:52.729 --> 40:01.279
we've gotten away from the basics as far as 
organizational structure goes. We've got too

40:02.040 --> 40:06.325
many people trying to call the shot. as a result, 
there's always conflict. But you've got to have

40:09.746 --> 40:13.109
unity of command, and we always had that in the 
Corps. It was a very clear, simple line, and you

40:13.530 --> 40:20.657
know who the boss was, and you knew who you were 
supposed to please. And when you don't know what

40:22.279 --> 40:29.045
the rules are and who you're supposed to please, 
frustration is the result. And I think that's why a

40:29.065 --> 40:35.552
lot of people are frustrated, is that they're not 
really sure what is expected of them and who

40:29.065 --> 40:35.552
they're supposed to please. But I like those 
aspects of the Corps. So in other words, it seems to

40:39.666 --> 40:45.877
me, and again, I don't want to put words in your 
mouth, you like the military aspects of the Corps.

40:45.897 --> 40:47.139
Yes. How about the spirit? Oh, yes. I like it. I like 
it very much. I enjoyed the yells and the songs. I'm

40:57.317 --> 41:00.362
surprised you didn't mention the camaraderie. 
Yes, I did. That was a... Very close-knit bunch.

41:06.369 --> 41:11.274
Almost

41:06.369 --> 41:11.274
like brothers. Like family. But that was 
primarily by class within an outfit. Now the

41:19.982 --> 41:23.625
outfit, of course, had its identity. But classes 
within the outfit are the ones that stuck together

41:24.226 --> 41:29.991
like glue and helped pull each other through. 
Those are the ones that got closed. Class 53, for

41:32.823 --> 41:35.927
example.

41:36.988 --> 41:42.536
The Class 53 in B Air Force was very, very close, and 
all the outfits were. To this day, we are. We'll

41:44.618 --> 41:50.947
have our 30th class reunion coming up this fall, 
and we'll probably all get together over at my

41:44.618 --> 41:50.947
house and talk about old times. I want to ask you a 
similar question, the one that we just are

41:50.967 --> 41:56.153
discussing. And that is, in what ways do you think 
that the Corps helped your career And are there any

42:01.831 --> 42:08.500
ways in which you think I might have hindered your

42:01.831 --> 42:08.500
career? I don't know of any way that it hindered my 
career at all. I think it helped my career in that

42:12.385 --> 42:19.595
wherever you go in the military, there are always 
Maggie's around. You've almost got immediate

42:20.276 --> 42:22.759
acceptance

42:25.945 --> 42:28.668
by the fact that you did graduate from A&M. I think 
the fact that so many of our graduates have done

42:28.688 --> 42:43.942
well and have exhibited a high degree of 
discipline and professionalism, then when

42:28.688 --> 42:43.942
someone knows that you're a graduate of A&M, they 
assume that you're also going to fit that mold. So

42:44.103 --> 42:51.670
in other words, a lot of hard work and good work by 
people older than me, I reap the benefits from

42:44.103 --> 42:51.670
that. And hopefully the younger people can do the 
same because of me the way I conduct myself. So it's

42:57.305 --> 42:58.146
a mold. It's a pattern that evolves. And so you can 
make certain assumptions about a guy that came

43:01.069 --> 43:06.755
through the Corps at A&M without ever having met 
him before. And usually they're not too far from

43:07.375 --> 43:11.680
being correct assumptions. So those types of 
precedent-setting things definitely help me.

43:18.106 --> 43:24.032
Plus the fact that the Corps teaches you to be kind 
of outgoing, boisterous, if you want to use that

43:18.106 --> 43:24.032
word. you

43:25.058 --> 43:54.897
won't be around too many Aggies very many places 
that have gone through the Corps that are not

43:25.058 --> 43:54.897
you're not around very long before you find that 
out they'll let you know real quick that they went

43:25.058 --> 43:54.897
through the Corps at A&M they're proud of it and of 
course you've got to be prepared to catch a certain

43:25.058 --> 43:54.897
amount of flack coming back at you but that's part 
of the positive benefit but you you have to be

43:25.058 --> 43:54.897
willing to open yourself up to some criticism in 
order to make yourself heard or to have your

43:55.231 --> 44:00.699
influence felt in certain circles. Aggies pretty 
well do that. What's the difference between a

44:02.903 --> 44:13.478
brand new second lieutenant from A&M and a brand 
new second lieutenant from West Point or now the

44:02.903 --> 44:13.478
Air Force Academy? That's a tough one because I've 
never had that much exposure to the West Point

44:14.981 --> 44:19.728
lieutenants. Most of the West Pointers I've known 
have been higher ranking officers. I would say

44:26.163 --> 44:30.207
that probably the same basic spirits are going to 
be there. The same degree of self-assurance might

44:30.588 --> 44:34.732
not be a bad word. Spunkiness.

44:38.636 --> 44:46.004
You're taught that you maybe are a little bit of cut 
above the average bear, and you believe that after

44:38.636 --> 44:46.004
a while. And if you believe it, chances are you'll 
act like it's true. I would say that probably the

44:50.549 --> 44:55.815
spirit between the three institutions are really 
not all that far apart. That's just an opinion I

44:57.196 --> 45:02.284
have. I've heard before from Aggies who have 
worked for Academy graduates that they're sort of

45:03.806 --> 45:21.692
a ring-knockers club, and that the way to get the 
best jobs or to get the fastest promotion is to be

45:03.806 --> 45:21.692
from the Academy. Does not being from the Academy 
even for reserve officers, does that hold you back

45:24.415 --> 45:29.662
in any way? Did you ever find that, or do you think 
that that's just an excuse for something? I think

45:34.267 --> 45:49.246
it's probably true to some extent in that if people 
in positions of authority,

45:34.267 --> 45:49.246
they try to identify young people that have 
potential.

45:50.287 --> 45:54.152
We use a term in the military that if you're ever 
going to really amount to anything rank-wise,

45:54.503 --> 45:59.220
you've got to have a sponsor, one or more sponsors. 
By that, we mean some higher...
