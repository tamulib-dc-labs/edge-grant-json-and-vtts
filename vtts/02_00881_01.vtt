WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:06.147
We're at the residence of Doris Davis in Houston. 
Doris has been a force in the planning of Houston

00:07.649 --> 00:18.779
for several years, and she will begin by telling us 
briefly about her background before she got to

00:07.649 --> 00:18.779
Texas.

00:23.363 --> 00:29.869
To begin at the beginning in my career in planning, 
I guess it was 1967 I decided to go to graduate

00:23.363 --> 00:29.869
school in urban planning, and I did that at Wayne 
State University. Why did you decide to go to

00:33.982 --> 00:35.904
planning school? That's an interesting 
question. Basically, I had a bachelor's degree in

00:38.528 --> 00:58.894
psychology and sociology, and I was then married 
to a clinical psychologist, and I wanted to, I had

00:38.528 --> 00:58.894
been working, doing social research work at the 
university, and I wanted to get a master's, and all

00:38.528 --> 00:58.894
I knew was that I didn't want to do anything like 
anyone I knew was doing, and I didn't know anyone

00:38.528 --> 00:58.894
who was an urban planner. And of course having been 
born and bred in Brooklyn, New York, I had a great

00:59.347 --> 01:06.816
interest in urban areas. So it was kind of one of 
those strange decisions that I didn't want to be

01:06.856 --> 01:14.024
anything else and that sounded good. So you sort of 
backed into it? Very much so, very much so. I think

01:18.669 --> 01:21.793
many of us did that. Shortly before I finished my 
degree, I went to work for a small consulting firm,

01:22.499 --> 01:31.693
and as you probably realize, that's where you 
learn how to be a planner is when you start working

01:22.499 --> 01:31.693
at it. And then the next several years, I worked at 
another, one of the first non-profit consulting

01:32.595 --> 01:46.817
firms around, and we did a lot of work for money, and 
we did a lot of work for free, and it all evened out

01:32.595 --> 01:46.817
and was very interesting. Uh-huh. I also taught at 
the Wayne County Community College where we had a

01:47.322 --> 02:06.501
two-year program that offered a degree in 
planning technology at that period of time when we

01:47.322 --> 02:06.501
saw planning as a profession that had no end and 
that felt there would be a great need for

01:47.322 --> 02:06.501
technicians and assistants to professional 
planners. I have no idea now what happened to that

02:07.262 --> 02:09.784
program. In 1973, I moved to Houston.

02:15.807 --> 02:21.452
had taken a job at the medical center here and 
proceeded to attempt to find employment.

02:22.413 --> 02:27.938
Interestingly, I had a lot of difficulty feeling 
that I had a pretty good background in planning.

02:28.639 --> 02:31.722
That was the very thing that seemed to make it hard 
to find a job. There was a fair amount of suspicion

02:31.762 --> 02:43.553
and concern about a northern planner that knew all 
about zoning and that sort of thing, and that I

02:31.762 --> 02:43.553
would try to maybe instill some of these northern 
concepts into my work here. Early March 1st, as a

02:45.480 --> 02:53.509
matter of fact, of 1974, I did go to work for the 
Council of Governments. I was hired there as an

02:54.650 --> 03:01.938
environmental planner, which was some 
interesting since that hadn't, to that point,

02:54.650 --> 03:01.938
been my background at all. However, I had a strong 
background in demographics and land use and, in

03:02.378 --> 03:11.548
fact, my initial assignments were to work in 
demographics and land use for Environmental

03:11.900 --> 03:14.462
planning is a backup to that. I do remember when you 
were an environmental planner. That's when we got

03:21.389 --> 03:23.731
to know each other first. Well, that was my 
evolution, in a way, at HGAC was that whenever I

03:25.013 --> 03:38.646
would decide that I was sort of bored and it was time 
to move on, some opportunity would come up and I

03:25.013 --> 03:38.646
would find a whole new area to work in. And 
ultimately, as you know, before I left there, I was

03:41.380 --> 04:01.148
manager of community and environmental 
planning, and that had taken our environmental

03:41.380 --> 04:01.148
program, our community development, economic 
development program, and our information

03:41.380 --> 04:01.148
program, which was the demographics and land use, 
and pulled them all together into what was really

03:41.380 --> 04:01.148
pretty much a comprehensive planning 
department.

04:05.014 --> 04:08.198
Doris, how do you perceive the How would you 
characterize planning in Houston when you got

04:10.574 --> 04:14.858
here? Well, it was a bad word. The very first sort of 
professional planning meeting I attended in

04:18.321 --> 04:30.032
Houston, even before I found a job, I'll never 
forget, it was at Rice University, and the keynote

04:18.321 --> 04:30.032
speaker was then Mayor Louis Welch. And he stood up 
and announced to the audience that Houston had no

04:30.933 --> 04:36.638
need of planners. Houston was doing fine growing 
wild. And

04:39.818 --> 04:50.067
this was, I see, so that you felt that the 
environment was not particularly supportive.

04:51.348 --> 04:51.828
Definitely. There was, almost appeared to be 
concern about planners, and in fact when I went to

04:51.888 --> 05:02.517
work at the Council of Government, there was 
almost concern that I was a professional planner.

05:03.198 --> 05:09.403
And although they portrayed themselves as a 
regional planning agency, at the time, that I

05:09.586 --> 05:16.414
started work, I think I was the second person there 
that had a bona fide urban planning master's

05:09.586 --> 05:16.414
degree in urban planning.

05:20.600 --> 05:38.682
Now, from your knowledge of planning in the 
Houston area in general, how do you see it

05:20.600 --> 05:38.682
functioning in terms of,

05:20.600 --> 05:38.682
well, let's characterize it first, long-range 
planning and then day-to-day planning? And

05:39.387 --> 05:47.738
planning administration, you probably have had 
sufficient contact with city hall to have some

05:39.387 --> 05:47.738
view of that. And you might concentrate first on 
either that or HGAC, whatever you choose, and then

05:48.559 --> 05:57.151
go from there. Well, in a way, I see them as separate 
things. Let's keep them separately. If you look at

06:03.019 --> 06:07.825
the city of Houston, per se, in planning, from the 
first time I've been worked with them to this day.

06:10.383 --> 06:11.965
Planning is very fragmented. Every department 
has their own planning function, and they don't

06:12.627 --> 06:16.673
share it. And I would say in the last few years that 
the planning and development department has

06:17.234 --> 06:28.592
perhaps brought in a little more on those plans, 
but not to any great extent, so that Public Works

06:17.234 --> 06:28.592
tends to do planning. And in fact, all of the big 
money that has been spent in demographics has been

06:28.632 --> 06:33.880
spent out of Public Works. being caught for 
population forecasts for various plans that they

06:34.197 --> 06:39.605
do. The health department does planning. The 
solid waste department does planning. So that

06:46.214 --> 06:53.004
it's not the concept of comprehensive planning is 
really sort of alien in the city. Although, again,

06:53.204 --> 07:02.517
in recent years, I think there have been more 
efforts to think in terms of a comprehensive plan.

07:02.918 --> 07:18.959
mid-75, I guess the city had done some, I can't 
think of what it was called, it was Houston 2000 or

07:02.918 --> 07:18.959
something like that, which was, as I remember, 
consisted of a land use map of future land use.

07:18.979 --> 07:20.441
Yeah, I have a copy of that. Okay. There was, and 
when I was initially doing demographics, my first

07:21.863 --> 07:29.854
few years at HGAC, it wasn't to understanding of 
the political environment, there were many

07:30.138 --> 07:40.869
clashes, say, with City Hall in our visions of what 
the future growth would be like. And I, coming from

07:40.929 --> 07:54.964
the dense urban cities of the North, tended to see 
kind of centralized growth, particularly since

07:40.929 --> 07:54.964
there was so much land in which that could occur, 
whereas the view of city planning, which was the

07:40.929 --> 07:54.964
view of City Hall, was spread it out as far as 
possible and worry about the repercussions

07:55.484 --> 08:01.153
later. And there have been repercussions. The 
city was just hit with a half a million dollar fine

08:05.679 --> 08:12.169
for wastewater violations. And in 1974, when I was 
hired, it was because there were wastewater

08:13.050 --> 08:18.078
concerns in the area. And the city then was under 
notice that they would be enforced against.

08:23.817 --> 08:36.094
During that period of time, they were so busy 
building plants way out in the outer areas for new

08:23.817 --> 08:36.094
growth, and no efforts were made to keep the inner 
areas up to standards. Well, of course, Houston

08:37.015 --> 08:42.203
has had continual problems with air pollution. 
Yes, that's sort of another issue. Yeah, and they

08:46.689 --> 08:50.955
had at one time an excellent director of their air 
pollution control district, Mr. Cubedo. Yes, he

08:55.475 --> 08:57.397
passed away. He passed away, and we haven't heard 
much about it lately. But for a while, wasn't

09:01.183 --> 09:10.478
Houston under a federal court order that 
restricted any new industry? And that, again, was

09:12.180 --> 09:16.707
in the early to middle 1970s, and I remember it 
quite clearly because I was very impressed by the

09:17.041 --> 09:21.406
southern way of doing business. I believe the EPA 
said, you're not going to be able to grow anymore.

09:25.792 --> 09:27.334
And Houston said, go away. And they went away. 
Which is really about the way it sized up. And it's

09:34.102 --> 09:35.444
still a problem today. And they are, again, facing 
very severe penalties for ozone pollution in

09:35.484 --> 09:41.952
particular.

09:45.745 --> 09:48.788
So they simply said, go away, and the feds did. 
Basically, that's what happened. There was a lot

09:50.170 --> 09:56.436
of effort on the part of the Chamber of Commerce, 
and there was a lot of activity. And I'm sure there

09:56.516 --> 10:05.225
were some promises made, but there wasn't a great 
deal of regulation or anything that I could

09:56.516 --> 10:05.225
perceive happening in support of that. But they 
sort of said, everything's fine here, and no, we

10:05.245 --> 10:14.335
will not be enforced against, and so forth. That 
appeared to me. I wasn't in the midst of the

10:16.070 --> 10:18.714
happenings those days. But in viewing them, 
that's what appeared to happen. It's my

10:24.141 --> 10:31.692
understanding that most of the planning that is 
done in actual fact is done by developers. Well,

10:33.675 --> 10:37.019
there is a concept of private sector planning. And 
in fact, to a large extent, a great deal of very fine

10:37.079 --> 10:42.567
planning has gone on by developers. I think the 
problem is when there is a conflict between the

10:43.188 --> 10:52.562
public interest and the developer's interest 
that private sector planning tends to fall down.

10:54.164 --> 10:56.748
Those are some of my favorite things to discuss. 
For example, if you're talking about zoning,

10:57.309 --> 11:08.605
can't you accomplish the same ends in the way the 
developer did by providing land uses that were

10:57.309 --> 11:08.605
only compatible or patterns that were only 
compatible to certain sorts of development. You

11:14.305 --> 11:18.932
don't put a gas station in the middle of a 
cul-de-sac, for example. And that was a way of

11:19.152 --> 11:22.617
planning that can work. It's when the two 
interests really separate that the problems

11:23.117 --> 11:29.526
exist.

11:33.231 --> 11:33.792
Okay.

11:36.736 --> 11:38.018
How is the... city planning department 
organized? Today. Well, when you first got here.

11:48.123 --> 11:57.811
When I first got here, and I don't know that I'm the 
right person to speak to this, my sense was that the

11:48.123 --> 11:57.811
greatest city planning appeared to do two things. 
One was to keep track of data, land use and changes,

11:57.851 --> 12:07.380
and to try to forecast the future, and the other was 
to work with developers on subdivisions and

12:07.732 --> 12:11.799
plants. I never had a sense of any sort of overall 
comprehensive planning. Today, the planning

12:17.849 --> 12:22.317
department has many more responsibilities than 
they had then. Community development under the

12:22.818 --> 12:30.191
Community Development Block Grant is part of the 
planning department. The planning department's

12:30.231 --> 12:33.216
involved in economic development. they've taken 
on some additional functions and they are making

12:34.057 --> 12:49.657
an effort to do some comprehensive planning 
starting at the neighborhood level and with the

12:34.057 --> 12:49.657
idea of building a lot of neighborhood plans that 
then could be incorporated into a proper

12:34.057 --> 12:49.657
comprehensive plan. This is an approach I've 
always referred to as cut and paste. Well, it can

12:54.403 --> 12:55.164
be. I think that it's, at this point in time, 
perhaps the only approach that's politically

12:55.264 --> 13:00.571
feasible here. And even... I may be sorry I say 
this, but the development ordinance that was

13:05.242 --> 13:18.097
passed some years ago, which is a strong planning 
tool in many ways, appeared to come out of city

13:05.242 --> 13:18.097
council rather than out of the planning 
department. Who administers the deed

13:20.240 --> 13:27.028
restrictions that have to do with the use of land? 
Does the planning department have any role in

13:27.048 --> 13:30.192
this? Not that I know of. The only role, it's a 
private... And the city some years ago felt it had,

13:35.009 --> 13:48.310
and I believe it was challenged in the courts, and 
indeed they had a legal right to assist in

13:35.009 --> 13:48.310
upholding the restrictions. As far as I know, that 
would be city legal. So a subdivision that was

13:51.084 --> 14:00.913
having a problem keeping their restrictions 
enforced, or if someone tried to do something

13:51.084 --> 14:00.913
else, could go to city legal for assistance. And 
I'm not positive about the way that works. I can

14:04.636 --> 14:06.278
find out. OK. You got here during Roscoe Jones' 
tenure as planning director. Yes. Who was the

14:16.943 --> 14:21.769
executive director of HGAC when you got here? When 
I got here, it was Royal Hatch, who was a retired

14:22.209 --> 14:40.991
brigadier general from the Air Force and had 
another career since and was working as, I believe

14:22.209 --> 14:40.991
he was chairman of the Gulf Coast Waste Disposal 
Authority before he came to HGAC. He'd only been

14:41.872 --> 14:44.875
there less than a year when I went to work there. 
What was his style of leadership?

14:50.822 --> 15:00.538
His style was very much trying to work with the 
elected officials closely and understanding the

14:50.822 --> 15:00.538
concept of regionalism. He was very much an 
outside man, worked with funding agencies,

15:00.618 --> 15:11.757
worked with the city representatives and the 
county representatives.

15:12.800 --> 15:19.477
an inordinate amount of time with the day-to-day 
technical aspects of planning. He left that to the

15:19.517 --> 15:23.988
staff, pretty much. And he was succeeded by whom? 
Jack Steele, who had been actually grew up in the

15:28.460 --> 15:45.337
cog business, had worked at Southeast Texas 
Regional Planning Commission, went to HGAC in, I

15:28.460 --> 15:45.337
believe, 73 as criminal justice manager, and had 
worked up to director of programs, deputy

15:28.460 --> 15:45.337
executive director, and succeeded at Royal 
Hatch. And what was his management style like?

15:49.541 --> 15:54.706
Well, his management style, and he is still there 
today, is very different. He is very technically

15:54.866 --> 15:58.450
qualified in many areas. and pays a lot of 
attention to the program areas rather than to the

15:59.324 --> 16:15.263
political side of things or to spending a lot of 
time, you know, whining and dining politicians.

16:17.706 --> 16:18.327
Okay. What were some of the outstanding programs 
of HGAC? Well, the HJC programs have evolved

16:25.649 --> 16:29.173
considerably. Do you want me to kind of start at the 
beginning? Sure. The COG was formed, as were most

16:32.577 --> 16:46.873
COGs, I guess, in 1966, pretty much in response to 
A95 and the desire locally to be part of approving

16:32.577 --> 16:46.873
and disapproving federal projects. I think that 
there was a fair amount of controversy about

16:47.734 --> 16:53.040
whether to form a COG. And Emmet Lowery, who is 
mayor of Texas City and was at the time and was on the

16:53.510 --> 17:09.687
committee of elected officials that was meeting, 
deciding whether to start a regional planning

16:53.510 --> 17:09.687
commission, says that there was just 
considerable disagreement. And a big issue, and I

17:09.787 --> 17:21.019
think we may come back to this later, was how 
communities would be represented because the

17:09.787 --> 17:21.019
city of Houston was so big and compared to any of the 
other cities and counties even, whether if it was

17:21.235 --> 17:28.583
one man, one vote, then it was the city's cog. And if 
it was equal representation, not caring about

17:28.903 --> 17:37.653
population, then the city could very well get hurt 
in the process. This has been a classical problem

17:37.693 --> 17:42.178
facing cogs throughout the country. And I can 
understand that. Oh, yeah. And, for example, when

17:45.021 --> 17:49.065
I was with ABAC in the San Francisco region, There 
we had two central cities, Oakland and San

17:49.585 --> 17:53.210
Francisco. And there was a certain amount of 
jealousy, of course, between, and then Berkeley

17:53.911 --> 17:58.658
as a third. So it was quite complicated. And the 
same thing has happened elsewhere in the country,

18:01.562 --> 18:06.789
almost without exception. Well, and of course, 
Houston was just so much bigger than any other

18:07.290 --> 18:11.716
community. And it was agreed, though, that the 
other communities just weren't interested if it

18:12.377 --> 18:19.086
was going to be a Houston animal. Houston agreed at 
that time that they would not take it over. And as

18:26.758 --> 18:32.123
the, and I don't believe the board composition has 
changed much over the years. When the COG was

18:32.163 --> 18:44.895
formed it was eight counties and I don't know 
exactly which year but about maybe two or four

18:32.163 --> 18:44.895
years later it was made into 13 counties by the 
state who determines the area. And the board of

18:45.436 --> 18:47.858
directors, each county has One position, Harris 
County being so large, has two. The city of Houston

18:51.452 --> 18:58.498
has two seats, and other cities, 25,000 or over, 
each have a seat. There are two seats for cities,

18:59.539 --> 19:08.347
home rule cities under 25,000, and two seats for 
general law cities under 25,000. One for

19:09.709 --> 19:16.815
independent school districts, one for soil and 
water conservation districts, and Houston

19:09.709 --> 19:16.815
Independent School District. That's 
interesting. At ABAC, none of the school

19:18.884 --> 19:22.229
districts have representation. Only units of 
general purpose government. Well, you know, some

19:24.693 --> 19:27.878
of them don't even have school districts as 
members.

19:30.822 --> 19:40.677
So even though Houston and Harris County have four 
seats out of 27, it doesn't allow them to have a

19:30.822 --> 19:40.677
majority or to make the decisions for the COG. 
However, I think there was recognition that

19:41.787 --> 20:01.094
Houston needed in some way to work with some of the 
other communities, and although that may be

19:41.787 --> 20:01.094
getting ahead of myself, I really think the major 
thing was that they needed to have this regional

19:41.787 --> 20:01.094
planning commission in order to have a little more 
power over grants that came into the area. Then, of

20:01.976 --> 20:10.748
course, with the years of 701 money, there was a 
natural source of funding, and it wasn't going to

20:01.976 --> 20:10.748
cost anyone particularly anything to have this 
animal. I think the planning that was done then was

20:11.335 --> 20:17.704
extremely responsive to federal regulations. It 
was minimal. We'll do what we have to do to keep the

20:20.307 --> 20:25.254
money flowing, but we're not going to do too much 
else. It was sort of a pipeline for money. Exactly.

20:28.358 --> 20:36.710
In the early years, almost all of the work of the 
very small staff, from what I gather, almost all

20:28.358 --> 20:36.710
the work was done by consultants. So in addition to 
doing what the federal government wanted, The

20:40.799 --> 20:49.207
actual work was done by people that understood the 
local interests and was, you know, quite

20:40.799 --> 20:49.207
controlled. At the time that I went to the COG in 
1974, there was still a perception that this would

20:50.048 --> 21:04.463
try to be a tool of the federal government and one 
had to always be cautious about it. And I think the

21:05.164 --> 21:09.608
staff themselves were very torn all the time 
between what the federal government wanted and

21:09.993 --> 21:22.503
what a trained planner might feel would be the 
right way to pursue a planning process, and what

21:09.993 --> 21:22.503
the local governments appeared to want, which was 
to leave them alone to do their own thing. So there

21:24.006 --> 21:28.457
was a lot of conflict, I think, in early planning 
efforts when the staff went too far towards what

21:29.551 --> 21:32.575
they viewed of as planning. The board would tend to 
get kind of upset about it, or individual

21:32.715 --> 21:37.542
governments would. When the staff was doing what 
the local governments appeared to want, the

21:38.984 --> 21:44.692
federal government wasn't very happy. And in 
fact, towards the end of 701 money, I guess in 79 and

21:46.155 --> 21:59.153
80, we had really, before the money stopped 
flowing, made a conscious decision that we

21:46.155 --> 21:59.153
weren't going to apply for it any longer, because 
we were had so much administrative work with

21:59.369 --> 22:10.306
regard to the grant, and only a small piece of the 
grants were being used to do what the local

21:59.369 --> 22:10.306
governments wanted, which in those days was 
information. They wanted good data. They wanted a

22:12.269 --> 22:17.958
lot of day-to-day technical assistance and 
handholding, which was valid. But they didn't

22:17.978 --> 22:23.226
want the kinds of strategic plans that HUD was 
beginning to require. And the one that we did for

22:24.368 --> 22:25.950
HUD, In fact, never got out of draft form. The money 
went away, and we never had to do anything further

22:28.174 --> 22:30.998
about it. Plans that were controversial were 
those that had to have local government approval

22:31.939 --> 22:38.989
in addition to just the COG doing it.

22:42.274 --> 22:48.723
But because there was a very good flow of money, the 
COG in the early years did some very innovative

22:42.274 --> 22:48.723
work. We were talking at lunch about Charles 
Trost, for example. In the late 60s and early 70s,

22:52.137 --> 23:01.210
he developed some very sophisticated computer 
programs that we had a computerized library. What

23:01.670 --> 23:04.835
was his title then? Well, he went through a bunch of 
titles. He functioned in some ways as planning

23:08.460 --> 23:11.164
director. He had one title was director for 
intergovernmental affairs and His title and

23:18.260 --> 23:23.928
titles at HJC were frequently not exactly 
reflective of what people did. When I was told he

23:25.170 --> 23:32.180
was planning director and went to look for a job 
there, I was told to speak to someone else who was

23:25.170 --> 23:32.180
director of special projects. So it was always 
very confusing, at least in the early years, as to

23:32.220 --> 23:38.408
what this was. And still the planning title was 
uneasy for a local government. Frequently, in

23:45.648 --> 23:52.956
fact, when we were maybe doing some of our best 
planning, you'd never see anything called plan in

23:45.648 --> 23:52.956
something. Anyway, the COG was involved in very 
sophisticated computerized things. They were

24:00.424 --> 24:06.830
involved in the very early days of Landsat 
mapping, working with NASA and so forth. They

24:08.292 --> 24:15.199
worked with David Birch from, I guess he was then 
with Harvard, Yale. on what was called Recycum,

24:15.989 --> 24:38.050
and it was a very sophisticated simulation model 
that could spit out all kinds of demographics of

24:15.989 --> 24:38.050
every sort, which wound up being something of a 
fiasco because it got to be known as the Black Box,

24:15.989 --> 24:38.050
and it was one of those things where you never could 
figure out what went into it, and so what came out,

24:15.989 --> 24:38.050
you weren't too sure about. But still, for 
planning at that time, it was very sophisticated.

24:43.327 --> 25:08.734
I kind of grew up in the days of 208, the big waste 
treatment management planning, and though in

24:43.327 --> 25:08.734
those years the Houston plan was considered some 
disappointing, since it was in many areas very

24:43.327 --> 25:08.734
great compromise, in retrospect, I find that it 
really said some good things and was perhaps, you

24:43.327 --> 25:08.734
know, a forerunner to what we might now call 
strategic or policy planning. But at that time,

25:09.174 --> 25:12.878
the concern of the local governments was that it 
say, as little as possible, but be adequate to get

25:13.195 --> 25:19.945
certified so that the construction grants money 
would continue to flow. I think one of the most

25:21.787 --> 25:37.049
important things that happened for the regional 
agency, NHGAC in particular, given the political

25:21.787 --> 25:37.049
surroundings and so forth, was when most of the 
federal money dried up. And when there suddenly

25:37.549 --> 25:41.515
wasn't federal money, and we were talking about 
spending local, dollars or soliciting

25:41.765 --> 25:50.219
contributions for specific work, the work became 
more part of the local government. When did this

25:51.220 --> 25:53.304
transition occur? This started happening in 80. I 
guess the last of the 701 money was in 81. And

26:00.896 --> 26:07.907
suddenly when we would present the budget, which 
was a program type budget, you know, goals and

26:08.258 --> 26:11.362
objectives and this is what it'll take to reach it. 
The board started coming up with ideas of things

26:12.663 --> 26:15.827
they wanted done. The first thing that I was 
heavily involved with that was locally funded was

26:15.867 --> 26:33.507
in 79, beginning in 79 when we had some major floods 
in the area and the board said there must be

26:15.867 --> 26:33.507
something that HGAC could be doing to make sense of 
this problem. And initially, it started from the

26:34.094 --> 26:40.461
fact that people were being evacuated from, say, 
Galveston and being sent to Colorado County. And

26:40.481 --> 26:42.923
no one in Colorado County was told they were 
coming. And there wasn't enough food. And it was

26:44.104 --> 26:46.747
just kind of horrendous. And it was then that HJC 
started to begin to evolve into the role of truly

26:47.468 --> 27:03.865
regional organizer

26:47.468 --> 27:03.865
or, I can't think of a good word now. But we first did 
an emergency, well, it wound up being a directory

27:04.199 --> 27:12.550
for local officials in emergency preparedness or 
something. And it was a step-by-step, here's what

27:12.590 --> 27:17.056
you do if the water is going to rise. And it pulled 
together information from all kinds of places. It

27:23.504 --> 27:33.717
presented elected officials a workbook they 
could put in their drawer where their city

27:23.504 --> 27:33.717
manager, whoever, would fill out the phone 
numbers that were right for that particular

27:23.504 --> 27:33.717
jurisdiction. After that piece of work was 
concluded, they said, but we need to do more.

27:38.144 --> 27:49.982
There's still this enormous flood problem, and 
it's clear that it might flood in Houston because

27:38.144 --> 27:49.982
of rains in Fort Bend County or in Brazoria because 
of rains in Harris County. What can we do about

27:50.022 --> 27:51.824
this? And so they asked us to do a study that had 
well, two major goals. One was who is really

27:59.314 --> 28:02.457
involved in flood control. And secondly was kind 
of assess what current efforts were. And what we

28:08.342 --> 28:18.311
discovered was that there were hundreds of local 
agencies, local, state, and federal agencies in

28:08.342 --> 28:18.311
this 113 county area who had responsibilities in 
flood control. And nobody was talking to anybody.

28:21.774 --> 28:27.919
There were virtually no joint projects going on 
between the two communities. very little, and

28:28.186 --> 28:39.642
this was where you got into the local sticky 
politics, very little of what we call floodplain

28:28.186 --> 28:39.642
management, which tends to be land use 
management. The report was very, very well

28:40.543 --> 28:53.220
received, and as a follow-on piece of work, more 
money, local money, was used to begin a flood

28:40.543 --> 28:53.220
control task force. I don't know. That wasn't what 
we called it. We called it It had sort of a nice name,

28:58.156 --> 29:00.258
I can't remember. But it was, we got together the 
major actors in the 13 counties, and they sat at a

29:00.298 --> 29:08.866
table once a month, and they discussed flood 
control issues. And a piece of work that they

29:09.467 --> 29:27.724
basically, the staff did under their direction, 
was to survey all of the communities and ask them

29:09.467 --> 29:27.724
what equipment and manpower and so forth they had 
that they would be willing to share with other

29:09.467 --> 29:27.724
communities, and what projects they might be 
willing to work on jointly. It was very valuable

29:28.497 --> 29:38.170
from, if nothing else, from the extent that some of 
these people said, well, now I know who to call if I

29:28.497 --> 29:38.170
need help, which didn't exist before. It was 
moving again towards this idea that in order for a

29:40.053 --> 29:49.847
region to survive, even if there's one major 
entity, you have to have coordination and

29:40.053 --> 29:49.847
cooperation. And I think the COG began to evolve 
into understanding how communities work

29:50.568 --> 29:56.496
together. that even in some work we did for HUD 
around the same time where HUD had an objective of

29:57.404 --> 30:15.945
moving, decentralizing public housing and 
moving people from one community to another, and

29:57.404 --> 30:15.945
all of which didn't make a whole lot of sense here 
because we just didn't have enough of it anywhere.

30:15.965 --> 30:18.348
It wasn't a question of people being centralized. 
And what we were able to do there was find that some

30:19.409 --> 30:24.255
of the smaller housing authorities simply 
weren't equipped to do a good job of housing

30:24.573 --> 30:27.558
delivery. And this happens a lot when you have one 
big community and a lot of little ones. And we

30:31.885 --> 30:43.624
formed, again, an association of local housing 
authorities and got the housing authorities

30:31.885 --> 30:43.624
working together, which was the only way they 
could move towards this goal of allowing people

30:31.885 --> 30:43.624
movement within an area. And the issue of the 
public housing on Allen Parkway is still with us,

30:45.707 --> 30:51.397
isn't it? Yeah. And it was interesting, in the 
course of that work, one of the more traumatic

30:52.214 --> 31:00.890
times of my public service, there were two schools 
of thought. HUD was of the opinion that you were

31:01.411 --> 31:10.187
hurting minority and low-income people by 
keeping them bottled up in small concentrations.

31:10.808 --> 31:12.872
Well, after they gave money...
