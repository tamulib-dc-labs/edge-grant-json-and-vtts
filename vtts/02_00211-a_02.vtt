WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:06.747
Y'all did not get married before the war? It was 
five years before we got married. We dated five

00:09.511 --> 00:12.635
years, and he was in the Marine Corps at Camp 
Felton. And I taught a year of school, and then I got

00:13.357 --> 00:22.250
on the American airline and flew out to 
California, and we got married, and we thought

00:13.357 --> 00:22.250
we'd be together six weeks. And they had the 
problem with the landing boats out in the marshals

00:23.592 --> 00:32.265
on the coral reefs, and they had to redesign the 
landing boats And so we lived in Laguna Beach for

00:33.241 --> 00:39.290
six months. And he left, I think, on January 44. 
Went to Maui was the first landing they had.

00:51.708 --> 00:53.571
I think that's the name of it. How many landings did 
he make with the Marines? Two or three. Saipan is

00:59.460 --> 01:02.404
where he was hit with a grenade. He was wounded, I 
don't know how, where was he injured? Well, he got a

01:10.399 --> 01:21.010
hand grenade in his lungs and he had one under the 
bone here and the scar always vibrated. How that

01:21.951 --> 01:26.856
didn't cut his tubular vein, I don't know. and 
stand up and go in and pull these out of his lungs.

01:30.697 --> 01:33.381
And there was some they never could get that they 
watched for years. But it

01:34.302 --> 01:41.792
was a Japanese tag in the tree that's written 
through his name. And he was evacuated. And I heard

01:43.955 --> 01:48.621
from him 40 days after he went into combat. He 
always told me he would never get a letter after he

01:48.681 --> 01:51.645
went into combat. He always would get a letter from 
a dead man. So there are 40 days that you didn't hear

01:54.709 --> 01:57.433
anything. But I didn't hear anything. But on 
Monday, when the battle was over, I told my father I

01:58.970 --> 02:03.576
would hear from him that week. And my sister got a 
letter at the post office and ran all the way home.

02:09.182 --> 02:10.864
So I got ready to cry. It was a hard week. And my daddy 
came in. He had asked me early. He was going off with

02:16.851 --> 02:19.394
the telegrams. He had asked them when they had a 
death telegram, could he go? Because one woman had

02:26.303 --> 02:33.810
been given one that her son died, her only child had 
died, and she was in an office in a building all by

02:26.303 --> 02:33.810
herself all day. They just went up and handed it. 
And so I went down and handed my letter to my father.

02:40.937 --> 02:46.782
He didn't want me hearing something without him 
being there. And I handed it to him, and he handed it

02:46.802 --> 02:50.646
back to me. I said, Jack's alive. I didn't say 
Jack's injured. Jack's alive. And he said, you'll

02:56.797 --> 03:00.041
have to read it to me, I can't see it. And I looked and 
he was crying. And Jacket was already in the

03:03.325 --> 03:09.313
hospital then in Hawaii.

03:12.437 --> 03:15.761
And they always talk about Roosevelt not letting 
anybody see him in a wheelchair. He came into their

03:16.422 --> 03:20.166
hospital in a wheelchair. He came to this, didn't 
he? Franklin Roosevelt did. In Hawaii. Don't you

03:25.822 --> 03:27.204
think that's interesting? You bet. They always 
said that he never would allow himself to be. But

03:30.849 --> 03:33.533
these real veterans saw him in a wheelchair. 
That's it. Now, Dr. Williams was in the hospital

03:34.775 --> 03:38.040
about how long? Forgotten by now. He was alive and 
excellent. See, I got to know other people that

03:44.772 --> 03:50.020
didn't get to the hospital where they lost their 
husbands. And so, you know, we were a group. We

03:54.026 --> 03:58.333
partied together, you know, and they got home. 
Right. About when did he get home? When did you all

04:00.256 --> 04:01.698
get back together? The war was over. And, you know, 
you had to have so many points to be out. Well, they

04:05.684 --> 04:08.748
kept reducing the points. And I was teaching 
school, and I gave him notice because he couldn't

04:08.768 --> 04:13.075
come to me. home from the war and come to Redford, 
Virginia while his wife kept teaching school. So I

04:18.655 --> 04:21.558
gave him notice and he kept moving up the time. And 
so finally I met him in Roanoke and I had reserved us

04:22.039 --> 04:27.185
a hotel room in Roanoke. But the next day we got up 
and got on the bus and went to his mother and daddy's

04:27.205 --> 04:31.510
home. But his brother had brought his mother over 
for dinner that night. She couldn't wait till the

04:36.395 --> 04:37.797
next day. And I didn't think, I hadn't thought that 
would be cruel. for him to get off the plane and

04:41.270 --> 04:45.114
let's have a place to sleep that night over there. 
We held that room for a week with his luggage in

04:45.154 --> 04:50.860
there, stuff he brought back. And we only stayed 
that first night. We were out visiting our two

04:52.381 --> 04:59.288
families with pen men on the room in the hotel. And I 
said to him, now, this is an interesting thing. If

05:03.512 --> 05:05.474
you're going to be a lawyer, let's go to Harvard. 
Let's go to the best. He said, no, I'm going to go

05:07.136 --> 05:09.538
into education. Men are needed in high schools. 
And he had learned from that short period of time

05:12.732 --> 05:21.604
that it took a man to have the discipline that was 
needed in high schools. See, that's what's wrong

05:22.145 --> 05:23.967
now with the school. It's not the teachers. It's 
not the classroom. It's the students. It's the

05:28.653 --> 05:30.936
lack of discipline. How did you all happen to end up 
at Emory instead of some other school? Why Emory

05:35.342 --> 05:37.405
University? He had a good friend that was a 
graduate of Emory. And he knew it as a method of

05:40.518 --> 05:42.340
school. He always went to private schools, so he 
taught in . But Charlie was a good friend of his in

05:46.444 --> 05:53.451
Hawaii. And Charlie was an Emory graduate. And I 
think that had an influence on him. He probably

05:56.555 --> 05:58.737
said, that'd be a good school to get a degree in. And 
he just announced, no, I'm going to Emory, and I'm

05:59.618 --> 06:03.402
going to go into education. But his professor 
said, no, you can't. Now, how long were y'all at

06:07.535 --> 06:12.222
Emory before you came to Clemson? From March 23rd

06:12.242 --> 06:23.098
or something like that

06:12.242 --> 06:23.098
of 40, I have to count those years back then. I told 
you we came in August of 48,

06:24.500 --> 06:30.369
didn't I? We came to Clemson. And that meant this 
would have been 46. We came in March, and we left in

06:35.918 --> 06:38.701
August of 48. So we were on the Emory campus in a 
trailer for all that time. He got a master's

06:45.228 --> 06:46.389
degree. And we didn't incur to us that it was 
anything. We didn't invite his parents. They had

06:53.076 --> 06:57.240
come to Quantico to see him be commissioned. And 
when he got his doctorate, he went back to Emory.

06:59.503 --> 07:04.508
Now, the GED, was there a GED scholar? GRE. There 
was something that, when we were ready to go to

07:08.654 --> 07:24.792
Emory, one of his Emory professors was on that 
board and told Jack to meet him at the train station

07:08.654 --> 07:24.792
and wanted him to take one, but he waited to go to LSU 
or to Columbia in order to get this scholarship or

07:08.654 --> 07:24.792
graduate degree. And Jack said no, he knew what he 
was getting into. I think that's a graduate record

07:28.436 --> 07:30.678
exam. I think that is. Anyway, this Emory 
professor had him come to meet him at the train, and

07:34.711 --> 07:38.456
tell him that he wanted to have one. And Jack said 
no. And that he knew what he was getting into with

07:41.020 --> 07:44.505
Emory. So he went back to Emory. Or maybe the first 
time, I don't know. But anyway, I think Charles

07:49.392 --> 07:54.399
Harris influenced him. And

07:56.041 --> 08:03.612
that's the only thing I know, because he just knew 
where he was going to do what he wanted to do. He

08:03.632 --> 08:04.633
didn't consult me. So y'all came here in the fall of 
48, and you're here until? 66. 66. And then to

08:12.484 --> 08:25.299
Austin for two years, to Tennessee for two years, 
and then to Texas in November, to Texas A&M in

08:12.484 --> 08:25.299
November 1, 1970.

08:26.140 --> 08:32.006
When did you get to College Station? Did he precede 
you? I came in January. OK. I had to sell a house. You

08:36.185 --> 08:37.006
had to sell a house. And we had to work at a place to 
leave Mary with some relatives, but she could

08:37.026 --> 08:43.194
finish out of school. When you came, what were your 
goals as the university president's wife?

08:50.463 --> 08:57.111
Well, I didn't feel like they had changed from 
anything I had been here when he was vice

08:50.463 --> 08:57.111
president. I didn't have the same title, but I 
never got excited over any change. Isn't that

09:03.372 --> 09:04.854
terrible? I just took everything as it came and did 
the best I could. And everything included what?

09:11.601 --> 09:12.301
Whatever came. Well, if we were to meet somebody 
for a meeting or we were to get on the plane and go

09:13.302 --> 09:31.962
someplace or if he called and said, I'm bringing 
somebody by the house, make a reservation at the

09:13.302 --> 09:31.962
restaurant.

09:35.941 --> 09:45.255
I was just running my home like I always did and 
doing whatever came along and going to what came

09:35.941 --> 09:45.255
along. I didn't feel like that I was anything. I was 
just Jack's wife. How many nights did you all have

09:52.246 --> 09:58.075
unscheduled? Well, that would have varied, but we 
didn't have one. He had a full schedule. I could go

10:03.257 --> 10:06.461
pull out those little black books and show you how 
busy he was. And then he joined the boards. He was on

10:09.904 --> 10:13.848
several boards and he had those meetings too. And 
he did buy me some stock.

10:23.559 --> 10:31.007
So

10:23.559 --> 10:31.007
I could go to the meetings.

10:35.813 --> 10:39.958
I'm trying to think of what. I'll tell you in a 
minute. They were cotton. Oh, Anderson Clayton?

10:43.242 --> 10:44.023
Anderson Clayton. And he bought me 100 shares of 
Anderson Clayton so I could go to the stock

10:45.165 --> 10:51.192
meetings. But I didn't go to the stock meetings 
when he went to Dallas. And before he left there,

10:55.698 --> 11:04.048
they asked him to be on one of the bank boards,

10:55.698 --> 11:04.048
national bank boards. And he came in and said they 
asked me to be on the grant board. And I said, I don't

11:08.398 --> 11:10.621
know what to tell him about this town. He didn't 
want to really do anything with it. And I said,

11:14.526 --> 11:21.756
well, you already have a conflict with the 
December meetings because he was on enough boards

11:14.526 --> 11:21.756
in Dallas that he really did. And so I gave him an 
answer.

11:26.422 --> 11:33.512
But Anderson-Clayton was a good association for 
him. Do I remember his playing golf sometimes as a

11:33.830 --> 11:37.895
relaxation? Well, I did that. When we lived at 
Knoxville, I had said, we're living here, and

11:41.679 --> 11:49.329
there are all these resorts up here in the 
mountains, and it's time. The children are going

11:49.369 --> 11:53.754
to get gone, and we can just have a good time, and we 
should play golf. So I went over to the club and

11:53.774 --> 11:57.238
arranged for us to take lessons. He was in Memphis 
part of the time, and he was in Knoxville part of the

11:57.258 --> 12:01.263
time. So he didn't get all the lessons. But there 
came a time when we had secondhand clubs to start

12:03.327 --> 12:12.620
with, when he said go on out and start. And we did. 
And that's what got Jack into building, redoing

12:14.242 --> 12:20.371
the golf course at Texas A&M. He'd gotten 
interested in golf. And he had plans for a second

12:22.353 --> 12:26.159
golf course, mentally. I heard him say that he 
thought they should build, that A&M should have

12:26.399 --> 12:32.828
another golf course that wasn't enough for that 
size student body. But of course he didn't live to

12:33.618 --> 12:36.941
see that happen. But that's how he felt about 
coffee. You know, you're competing with

12:39.863 --> 12:41.325
yourself. I played with him when I was so cold that 
the tears would flow and he'd say, let's play the

12:43.426 --> 12:50.212
black nine. And I wouldn't tell him I was too cold to 
play, but I played. I just turned my head so he

12:55.036 --> 12:57.819
wouldn't see that I was crying. When you all were in 
College Station, what did you do for relaxation?

13:04.921 --> 13:07.584
Nothing exceptional. I just lived a normal life 
and read and did what I had to do with my daily

13:07.604 --> 13:13.850
chores. Time passed. Time passed. I didn't ever 
have any time on my hands. And let's say y'all were

13:20.397 --> 13:24.341
members of the A&M Methodist, you attended the 
Methodist church there. Y'all have been, were you

13:25.782 --> 13:29.806
both lifetime Methodists? Jack was. He joined us. 
The Baptist church, he didn't belong to a church.

13:37.013 --> 13:40.797
He joined the church in Emory University. Oh, I 
see. His grandfather was a primitive Baptist. I

13:44.661 --> 13:45.122
see. But he went to church, but not regularly. He 
was not a regular church member. Oh, going up. Oh, I

13:50.388 --> 13:51.709
see. At one time, one of our ministers stopped,

13:51.769 --> 14:02.560
told him he was being moved, and he called Jack and 
said, I have to talk to you before I leave. Would you

14:02.580 --> 14:03.261
meet me in... on the campus. And Jack went down 
there and he said, I can't leave until I tell you you

14:06.373 --> 14:13.302
should go in the ministry. Jack had worked in the 
church. He'd been chairman of the board. He'd

14:15.885 --> 14:17.687
taught students. Now, by what age was he then? It 
was when we lived here. Oh, here at Clemson? Yeah,

14:23.154 --> 14:23.995
here at Clemson. Oh. And Jack had worked in the 
church. had taught the students, and then he was

14:29.752 --> 14:32.395
teaching later on. He taught his senior adult 
class. And he did whatever came along with it, but

14:35.739 --> 14:46.452
he never belonged to anything very long before he 
was an officer. He had a way of sort of keeping

14:46.472 --> 14:50.257
things running smoothly, I think it was. I think it 
was a talent. Of all of the things he did, all of the

14:52.279 --> 14:58.206
different tasks, here Houston, Tennessee. No, 
no, not going to ask the negative. What do you think

15:04.221 --> 15:05.804
he enjoyed the most?

15:14.457 --> 15:21.188
Well, he had friends he enjoyed, but he enjoyed 
taking his children on a vacation trip. He enjoyed

15:21.809 --> 15:24.513
being home. All right, but then professionally. 
Professionally. Which of his professional

15:27.768 --> 15:33.554
accomplishments or tasks do you think he enjoyed 
most? He never talked about it. I was wondering

15:36.097 --> 15:36.817
what? He was just a happy person. Was he happiest 
teaching or administering?

15:46.827 --> 15:48.709
I would say it would be teaching. I cried the last 
time he taught class. I think Lynn actually wrote

15:52.053 --> 15:55.176
about it. That was

15:55.426 --> 16:23.661
here at Clemson.

16:23.978 --> 16:28.525
I realized that he loved teaching, he was good at 
it.

16:30.869 --> 16:33.954
Was there a course that you think he enjoyed most? 
No. He didn't talk about his work. This makes it

16:39.924 --> 16:50.661
hard for me because he didn't, I remember one day he 
came in and said, he held a meeting with his faculty

16:39.924 --> 16:50.661
staff He disagreed with what they thought they 
should be doing. His idea was different. He went

16:56.197 --> 17:01.823
back the next day, called them together, and told, 
you all are right and I'm wrong. I've thought it

17:01.943 --> 17:03.524
over. And they were amazed that they couldn't 
believe that anybody would ever admit that they'd

17:03.544 --> 17:09.210
been wrong. And when there came a time once, one 
dean, this is like the hard thing, one dean had to go

17:11.412 --> 17:20.361
down for a gang arrest. And he appointed one of his 
good friends. And he died. So the good friend was

17:26.933 --> 17:28.956
the acting dean. But Jack didn't feel like he was 
the one that should have the job permanently.

17:38.892 --> 17:45.583
And the acting dean was a good friend of Jack's dean 
of his school. Jack is the academic dean now. But he

17:50.210 --> 17:52.492
said the acting dean was lazy. And in spite of 
having to say no to Dean Hunter's best friend, he

17:54.835 --> 18:05.945
hired another man, brought another man in. And 
he's been honored and honored and honored. He was

18:07.887 --> 18:08.628
so great. Rather than just somebody just being 
inherited through friendship. And that isn't

18:13.373 --> 18:15.254
easy to do. The old timers, in other words. at the 
end of a work day, how could you tell it had been a

18:20.332 --> 18:27.320
good day or not a good day for him?

18:33.006 --> 18:38.912
I think it's just routine to have him come home and 
very seldom ever say anything for a comment.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.195
Anyway, he just acted like he was glad to be home. 
And the dog in the oxbow told him he was coming. The

18:45.279 --> 18:49.444
dog would hear the car, bang the floor with his 
table, look at me, keep looking at me, and Jack

18:49.694 --> 19:02.767
would drive up in the garage, and the dog and I would 
go to the door, and I would stick my head up for a kiss

18:49.694 --> 19:02.767
right here, and the dog would put his paws up on 
Jack's knee, and Jack would pat his head. That was

19:03.768 --> 19:04.809
our routine. The dog knew. And when Jack was in the 
hospital, you know, we had fired Willie, this same

19:07.471 --> 19:18.462
dog, and Willie came back to the house while Jack 
was in Houston with him there. Juanita was still

19:18.482 --> 19:19.363
there. The dog carried on so that one of them said 
she had to put the dog out of the house. He went with

19:23.595 --> 19:27.681
Willie in the car once, and he'd even never go near 
Willie again. He didn't like it, instinctively.

19:31.366 --> 19:32.127
Isn't that interesting?

19:35.272 --> 19:35.792
Let's see. You've got enough for me. No, no, no. I 
can't talk about what Jack thought or did or felt,

19:38.136 --> 19:46.347
because when we were home, it was just home, and it 
wasn't work. OK, now you see, that's an important

19:46.934 --> 19:51.178
characteristic, though, that I'm glad to get in 
here. You're saying that, by and large, he kept any

19:52.199 --> 20:02.089
worries, frustrations, and or exuberances, that 
he kept those comparatively quiet. Which is bad.

20:04.091 --> 20:11.999
If there's stress and you know that there's a bad 
gene in your family, it's bad to get taken that kind

20:04.091 --> 20:11.999
of work. I know a question. And there were people 
that were very stressful that he had to associate

20:12.680 --> 20:15.723
with. All right. What was his technique if he 
needed to make a key appointment? How did he go

20:24.471 --> 20:31.218
about trying to identify the appropriate person 
for that task? Well, he didn't consult me. I

20:32.599 --> 20:34.642
consulted him a few times. No, I don't know. He 
didn't appoint a search committee. He didn't? No.

20:41.569 --> 20:44.532
I guess he inquired, and part of it was, He was doing 
his homework. He was doing his homework, but he

20:46.751 --> 20:50.316
wasn't making a big issue of it. With whom did he 
inquire? I don't know. See, I think that his

20:53.460 --> 21:04.794
technique was to talk directly to people that he 
knew would give him a true answer, people that he

20:53.460 --> 21:04.794
really knew. That's why you and McCauley were good 
friends, because he knew he could trust him with

21:04.854 --> 21:11.362
any answer. He doesn't want a yes man. And I think he 
did his homework always. Also, when he got to Texas

21:16.004 --> 21:21.330
A&M, he had a lot of experience. He had worked up 
here through being president of the faculty

21:21.510 --> 21:26.295
senate. It was the biggest honor he ever had. He 
told me that the biggest honor I've ever had was

21:28.277 --> 21:38.749
being elected by my peers to be a member of the first 
faculty senate. I'm glad you put that in there.

21:40.531 --> 21:42.193
See, that's exactly the kind. Well, that was what 
happened. He was a member of the very first faculty

21:44.140 --> 21:49.766
senate, and he said that was the greatest honor 
he'd ever had. Alright, now, y'all were here when

21:49.786 --> 21:56.854
Harvey Gant, the first black student, came to 
enroll here. Do you remember anything you can

21:57.495 --> 22:01.239
share about those days? Yeah. They knew the 
problems that were going on in Arkansas and

22:04.243 --> 22:09.729
Alabama and so forth. They worked. They made it 
They worked out a schedule. They had a highway

22:15.026 --> 22:20.952
patrolman at every intersection from where 
Harvey was coming from until he entered the

22:15.026 --> 22:20.952
campus. They allowed the national press to be in 
the hotel, but not on the campus. And they brought

22:27.939 --> 22:37.268
Harvey up with a highway patrol escort, took him 
in, set him up in the Google architecture or

22:27.939 --> 22:37.268
wherever he was, and that was it, period. And 
Harvey had a wonderful sense of humor. And when

22:40.021 --> 22:46.232
things weren't going his, you know, if the 
students said anything to him, they'd give him all

22:40.021 --> 22:46.232
this freshman jobs to do. He said, you all just keep 
doing that to me, and I'll sit by you in the

22:46.452 --> 22:50.219
cafeteria. Which he showed you what a fine person 
he was. They did not allow a reporter on campus. I

22:58.613 --> 23:04.864
asked Dr. Williams one day about that, and I asked 
him, well, you mean there wasn't a single incident

23:05.992 --> 23:17.648
And as I recall, he said that when Harvey walked 
into the field house to register, two sophomore

23:05.992 --> 23:17.648
white male students said, where everybody could 
hear, here comes the coon. He said two Clemson

23:18.850 --> 23:32.850
campus police took those two young men to their 
room, watched them while they packed their bags,

23:18.850 --> 23:32.850
and took them to the county line and said, if you 
ever set foot in this county, you're under arrest.

23:32.870 --> 23:33.931
We're not going to tolerate that. And he said... It 
may have happened, see, but he wouldn't have come

23:35.523 --> 23:38.366
home and told me all of that. See the difference? 
Yeah, he said there was no problem at all, and he

23:39.347 --> 23:47.435
said there was careful planning by all kinds of 
people. And that day, he had one person that was a

23:48.396 --> 24:04.853
member of our supper club who stood up out on the 
steps of his building and watched all this taking

23:48.396 --> 24:04.853
place, and Jack didn't have any use for him after 
that. Oh. Because he was supposed to have gone

24:05.645 --> 24:09.809
about his business, about being out watching what 
was going on. A member of the faculty. And as far as

24:13.012 --> 24:14.294
he was concerned. Now, Jack didn't like 
everybody. You know that. He could be nice to

24:18.738 --> 24:21.161
people, but he didn't. I could tell you how the 
supper club, the three people, the three men he

24:21.401 --> 24:26.406
liked. He associated with them all for all those 
years. There were 12 families in it. He just had the

24:29.849 --> 24:31.571
entertainment. I could... But he liked people 
with a sense of humor, that he could joke with and be

24:34.535 --> 24:39.100
friends with. And I think that's why he liked book 
wires so much. A book could laugh with him in spite

24:42.804 --> 24:46.789
of all his problems. Now, let's see. Didn't fish. 
You all didn't go fishing. You didn't go hunting.

24:55.438 --> 25:01.285
While you were in College Station, did you all take 
many vacations?

25:01.973 --> 25:03.234
Well, we took vacations. We usually tried to go 
someplace where nobody knew us. Was it primarily

25:06.337 --> 25:10.821
to visit family, or was it to go to... We had to visit 
family every year. We had to come back and go to see

25:11.021 --> 25:13.824
our parents. We had to do that. One year, the year we 
built this house, we took the parkway and stopped

25:15.365 --> 25:27.557
at every place you could, and we cooked our meals 
along outside, and we went to... They did motels

25:27.577 --> 25:31.120
where they had a swimming pool, and we went to the 
art museums... And we'd do little things like

25:31.471 --> 25:34.074
that. We went to the Outer Banks, went up and saw the 
pageant up there. This is the type of family thing

25:38.740 --> 25:40.482
we did. Saw the pageant, and then we came down to 
Outer Banks with the children there where they had

25:42.824 --> 25:49.172
their wild horses and so forth. And he never called 
his office here. He would call my sister in the

25:52.075 --> 25:59.163
evening in Cincinnati and tell her where we were in 
case something happened in one of the families. He

25:59.184 --> 26:00.465
would report in. to Ohio instead of Clemson. He 
never made any contact with the university while

26:03.589 --> 26:12.785
we

26:03.589 --> 26:12.785
were away. We went to Florida one year, and then I 
went to the circus museum. That's the type of

26:19.156 --> 26:21.621
vacation we would take with the children. And he 
and I just started traveling when When he died,

26:26.905 --> 26:30.170
just going off on a nice vacation. In May, we joined 
Hugh and Pinky in London and toured London before

26:30.191 --> 26:38.144
he died in October. London and Scotland.

26:44.294 --> 26:52.508
And one year when we lived in Houston, I said, let's 
go to New York and see the Picasso exhibit. And he

26:53.129 --> 26:54.911
acted like I didn't say a word. So I called up Pinky 
and I said, would you like to go to New York to see the

26:55.893 --> 26:59.597
Pecanasol exhibit? She said, yes, we'll go when 
he's in Colorado. And he could tell the telephone

27:03.002 --> 27:09.410
conversation that she was going with me. And I 
said, do you want to go? And he said, well, you've

27:13.315 --> 27:17.340
already picked a date when Hugh's not going to be 
available. And so as it turned out, we couldn't get

27:17.801 --> 27:20.284
tickets for that weekend. So that looked like he 
was off. And then they added a week. So we added a

27:24.086 --> 27:26.690
week, and we went to New York. We were the last 
people to see the Picasso exhibit. But we went to

27:30.275 --> 27:34.080
six Broadway plays. And we had a wonderful time. 
You know, what I'm saying is our vacations were not

27:37.885 --> 27:42.251
anything fancy, but they were fun. But Jack was 
always quiet. You were around him to know that. He

27:49.380 --> 27:50.642
didn't stir up anything. No, but he always had that 
good sense of humor. He was just easy to be with.

27:57.382 --> 27:57.662
Yes. You know, for me, he was just that part of me 
that was easy to be with. If we were together,

28:02.790 --> 28:04.292
that's all it meant. That's all it mattered. You 
know, I don't know how to tell you all that. You're

28:09.740 --> 28:11.302
going to edit this stuff out, I hope. No, what we're 
going to do is try to get this typed up, give it back

28:11.643 --> 28:18.773
to you for you to correct, to... edit to add 
subtract what i hope you will do will be to add to it

28:18.938 --> 28:48.439
to fill in any gaps and so let's see and let's uh 
let's try to draw it to an end as you look back on

28:18.938 --> 28:48.439
those texas a m years what do you think were the most 
significant williams the two of you the most

28:18.938 --> 28:48.439
significant williams contributions to what a m is 
what it has become. Well, I don't feel like I made

28:50.364 --> 28:52.407
any. I just kept peace and family. And I felt like 
his biggest contribution was his staff, the

28:55.232 --> 29:03.846
people that he selected to put the programs 
together. And that's Jack's biggest

29:03.866 --> 29:05.488
contribution. He knows how to do that. I think it's 
natural for him to not want credit for himself, but

29:06.991 --> 29:13.300
to be able to pick a team. Do you agree with that? 
Well, I think you're being too modest I hope that

29:17.275 --> 29:24.323
the team was pretty good, but it was the leader of 
that team that really mattered to all of us. I felt

29:24.443 --> 29:32.132
like he was very fortunate in the people that were 
there that he could get to work with him and put his

29:24.443 --> 29:32.132
programs together. And I don't know where, some of 
the things, I don't know whose idea it was. The

29:36.216 --> 29:41.883
Galveston program, who's that? John Calhoun's, I 
assume. Don't you think that he was his? No. you

29:46.958 --> 30:01.291
know, different people made their 
contributions, and he was willing to follow

29:46.958 --> 30:01.291
through and develop anything he could, but his 
biggest contribution was the people that he

29:46.958 --> 30:01.291
worked with, you know, that he gave the 
responsibility to. In 1976, when the board of

30:01.311 --> 30:15.244
directors, I guess they were still called, we'll 
call them regents now, when they were going to

30:01.311 --> 30:15.244
recreate the system, and there needed then to be a 
president appointed, Whom did Dr. Williams

30:15.798 --> 30:18.202
recommend be the president?

30:24.514 --> 30:25.936
No, no, no. Dr. Williams is going to be the 
chancellor. They're recreating that job. But who

30:31.707 --> 30:32.889
did he recommend? He recommended John Calhoun. 
You know that. Well, that's what I thought. Yeah,

30:37.056 --> 30:37.958
you know that.

30:45.447 --> 30:48.710
He knew all these wonderful people in publishing. 
We're talking about Frank Wardlow now. Okay. He

30:51.133 --> 30:53.735
knew all these wonderful people in publishing. 
And we would be invited over for dinner and sit

30:53.755 --> 30:59.741
there and have an evening with all these marvelous 
people. You know, it was just fascinating to these

31:01.343 --> 31:07.389
people that he knew and to hear Frank Wardlow tell 
his stories. He was one of the most entertaining

31:07.850 --> 31:11.313
people I had ever heard. One of the most 
interesting men I've ever heard. And that

31:13.966 --> 31:16.512
marvelous South Carolina accent. Uh-huh. 
Uh-huh. It was just fabulous to listen to. And I

31:19.378 --> 31:25.130
went to his service up here when it happened. And 
somebody said, how many people were there? The

31:26.674 --> 31:27.756
McCauley's were with me.
