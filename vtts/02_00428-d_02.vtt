00:01.921 --> 00:05.906
There was an increasing amount of anti-military 
feeling in America at that time.

00:08.989 --> 00:25.869
What were your feelings toward that 
anti-military feeling, and was there anything

00:08.989 --> 00:25.869
that your

00:08.989 --> 00:25.869
department did to combat it or alleviate that 
feeling? Well, of course, my concern was

00:31.587 --> 00:34.710
with the Congress officially. As I mentioned, I 
think the vast majority of the members of

00:35.851 --> 00:54.871
Congress, when I first entered this office and 
became an observer of the scene with the Congress,

00:35.851 --> 00:54.871
were in solid support of the Vietnam War, and every 
vote they took reflected that on a related issue. I

00:56.093 --> 01:00.177
think by the time of this period you're talking 
about, by the end of 1970, only the minority really

01:00.815 --> 01:04.099
was there. And as you know, it wasn't long until 
congressional actions were being taken to really

01:04.219 --> 01:10.866
cut off the support for the Department of War. But 
everyone in the Army had to be conscious of this

01:12.148 --> 01:17.393
problem and concerned with it.

01:20.877 --> 01:25.683
The disenchantment of the people, particularly 
the youth, is true. It can't help the Army. You can

01:29.907 --> 01:30.849
only hurt. But what do you do about it? Really, it 
was a disenchantment with the Vietnam War. And of

01:42.208 --> 01:47.638
course, the people who were conducting the war 
were in uniform. And I don't think that it's

01:49.160 --> 01:54.109
entirely fair

01:56.890 --> 02:01.856
So much criticism fell upon the military who were 
there doing the job as they were instructed to do

01:56.890 --> 02:01.856
it. But nevertheless, it's understandable, I 
think. And we saw, of course, very serious

02:06.982 --> 02:14.611
results of that feeling. And I think the most 
serious that's going to affect us the most for the

02:14.651 --> 02:24.062
longest was the discontinuance of selective 
service. And President Nixon came to the

02:25.831 --> 02:32.640
conclusion that that selective service system 
had to be discontinued. And I think he came to that

02:33.081 --> 02:37.827
conclusion basically for two reasons. One, there 
was such opposition to military service,

02:37.847 --> 02:44.496
particularly among the youth. And it certainly 
had been demonstrated in those years of the

02:44.916 --> 02:49.382
Vietnam War. And two, I think there were some 
proper concern that a selective service system

02:55.345 --> 03:02.096
could not be conducted fairly.

03:05.181 --> 03:08.547
How can you be just? It had gotten into so many 
exceptions, you know. Sure. And the only reason

03:13.776 --> 03:19.706
you can justify those exceptions is because you 
don't need everybody anyway. Right. And, but the

03:21.940 --> 03:32.409
great cost of this, in my opinion, was evident from 
the time the decision, before the decision was

03:21.940 --> 03:32.409
actually made. Now, I didn't feel strong enough 
about this that I would revolt over it. And I don't

03:36.914 --> 03:39.796
think General Westmoreland liked the idea at the 
time. But when the decision was made, those senior

03:41.217 --> 03:50.766
military people and secretaries of the services 
set out to make a volunteer service work. But to me,

03:52.619 --> 04:02.750
and I said so at the time, the main hurt is not going 
to be the loss of that selection of men. Perhaps

04:04.532 --> 04:12.621
enough bodies can be attracted into the services 
to man them, and man them properly even. We didn't

04:13.361 --> 04:15.504
know at that time. But clearly, what we stand to 
lose most is the contact with the American people

04:21.087 --> 04:50.217
and their involvement in national security 
directly and what I mean is that when Johnny Doe was

04:21.087 --> 04:50.217
drafted

04:21.087 --> 04:50.217
almost inevitably I guess the sun is over the yard 
arm or whatever

04:21.087 --> 04:50.217
when Johnny though he was drafted, Mom and Papa 
almost inevitably wanted to know, why Johnny? Why

04:56.645 --> 04:57.946
does Johnny have to go? And Grandma and Grandpa 
felt the same way, and maybe brothers and sisters

04:57.966 --> 05:07.037
and aunts and uncles. Well, also, almost 
inevitably, after Johnny had been in a while, and

05:07.057 --> 05:18.651
they'd visited him at training camp and visited 
him in his outfit maybe, Johnny had learned why,

05:19.424 --> 05:22.888
and they learned why. We have to draft people 
because we have to have that much strength to meet

05:23.729 --> 05:31.818
our military commitments. Now I'm not talking 
about Vietnam specifically, I'm talking about in

05:31.858 --> 05:34.942
general. So not only Johnny, but his mom and dad and 
grandma and grandpa and aunts and uncles and

05:36.584 --> 05:49.178
brothers and sisters were involved.

05:51.487 --> 05:54.570
And they became informed. And this was extremely 
important to our, not just demanding the army, but

05:56.492 --> 06:07.844
important to our entire foreign policy and 
ability to carry it out. We've lost that. The

06:12.729 --> 06:20.177
minute the people were told that they were going to 
pay for an army, they might pay more. But they were

06:21.322 --> 06:22.884
going to use volunteers. They disconnected 
themselves from those concerns and those

06:23.885 --> 06:30.293
attachments. Don't worry about it. Just pay for 
it. Sure. Many people feel that they bought

06:34.979 --> 06:44.391
security,

06:34.979 --> 06:44.391
that they were buying security, but they weren't. 
They were simply buying a peacetime service. And

06:48.657 --> 06:50.299
there's going to be a great shock if and when we have 
another crisis that requires significant

06:52.793 --> 07:00.405
mobilization and the Johnnies are drafted again. 
Because a lot of people have just put it out of their

07:02.488 --> 07:05.372
minds. Now,

07:06.875 --> 07:15.128
the question is, can we withstand that shock? And I 
don't know. To tell you the truth, I don't know.

07:21.751 --> 07:49.092
When you combine that with

07:21.751 --> 07:49.092
the fact that

07:21.751 --> 07:49.092
we have fully accepted, as a nation of people, 
defeat at arms in Vietnam, we've long grown to

07:21.751 --> 07:49.092
accept a draw in Korea. And we think we've bought 
security when we haven't.

07:57.157 --> 08:10.958
The real question in my mind with regard to our 
national security is, do the people of this

07:57.157 --> 08:10.958
country have the will to provide for their 
security?

08:10.978 --> 08:11.759
And that worries me. I think we can have the best 
equipment in the world, But if we don't have a

08:19.447 --> 08:24.274
willing and determined hand on the trigger, it 
doesn't mean a thing.

08:27.799 --> 08:38.895
So we've got a lot of

08:27.799 --> 08:38.895
determination to be built back, I think. And I 
think the best thing that came out of that tragic

08:38.975 --> 08:47.327
and frustrating incident of our hostages being 
taken in Iran was the indication that the people do

08:47.594 --> 09:17.314
of this country do still have a feeling of 
patriotism and that's encouraging so maybe all we

08:47.594 --> 09:17.314
need to do is be put to the test but I'm very 
concerned that we've lost contact with

08:47.594 --> 09:17.314
international affairs and national security 
directly as families we think we bought security

09:17.547 --> 09:46.322
that we haven't we have found it comfortable to 
accept a defeat and perfectly acceptable to

09:17.547 --> 09:46.322
accept a draw so why where and when are we going to be 
determined to win again what about testifying in

09:17.547 --> 09:46.322
front of Congress you must have done that on a 
fairly frequent basis is that true that's not

09:46.471 --> 09:47.832
True, Terry. I very carefully avoided that. Yeah, 
did you let the Secretary of the Army do that

09:52.658 --> 09:55.741
instead? We used the Secretary of the Army, the 
Chief of Staff, and other chiefs, and commanders.

10:03.089 --> 10:15.443
Now, the reason I avoided that is that I could lose 
one case or be, you know, then I'd be ineffective as

10:03.089 --> 10:15.443
Chief of Legislative Liaison. Right. In fact, I 
testified only one time concerning whether

10:16.964 --> 10:32.405
senior officers should be permitted to be trained 
as pilots to fly Army aircraft. What was your

10:32.445 --> 10:34.228
opinion? My opinion was that they should. And it 
was a rather interesting thing. Incidentally,

10:38.313 --> 10:44.642
the Congress won on that one. but our Secretary of 
the Army their opinion was no Congress's opinion

10:45.398 --> 11:11.473
was no yeah we had had a program by which officers 
would be chosen as senior lieutenant colonels or

10:45.398 --> 11:11.473
colonels officers who were promising this had 
been going on for 20 years uh well it had been going

10:45.398 --> 11:11.473
on actually for about 10 years when Vietnam when we 
started moving into Vietnam those officers would

10:45.398 --> 11:11.473
be chosen to be

11:16.212 --> 11:44.683
necessarily but because they were promising 
officers who it appeared were going to go places

11:16.212 --> 11:44.683
and aviation was becoming more and more important 
in the Army and so we ought to have more senior

11:16.212 --> 11:44.683
officers from the combat arms particularly who 
are moving forward in grade and responsibility

11:16.212 --> 11:44.683
acquainted with the capability and limitations 
and the potential for the use of Army aviation

11:45.592 --> 11:46.893
That's the theory behind it. Anyway, that served 
us very well in Vietnam because we expanded Army

11:47.634 --> 12:06.134
aviation so greatly, not only in this 1st Cavalry 
Division, air assault, but also the 101st

11:47.634 --> 12:06.134
Airborne Division became an air assault 
division, and every division over there used

11:47.634 --> 12:06.134
aviation. What about inter-service rivalry 
between pilots in the Army and the Air Force? Was

12:12.201 --> 12:13.002
that a factor? No, not really. But I'll very 
briefly cover that incident. The Congress wanted

12:23.364 --> 12:27.550
to cut out this program of training senior 
officers. And the Secretary of the Army and the

12:27.570 --> 12:32.636
Chief of Staff were defending it, of course. I

12:32.656 --> 12:45.113
just wanted to very briefly tell this little story 
because it's a little bit interesting. Secretary

12:46.274 --> 12:55.006
of the Army and Chief of Staff kind of saw that they 
were losing the argument on whether to continue

12:46.274 --> 12:55.006
this training of senior officers so that they 
could understand aviation. When they got higher

12:55.026 --> 12:57.068
command, they could use it better. And General 
Westmoreland turned to me and said, Bill, General

12:58.610 --> 13:12.328
Becker, I think he said, you tell the members of the 
committee what you think about this because

12:58.610 --> 13:12.328
you're a product of the system. And that was true. I 
learned to fly after I was nominated promotion of

13:16.193 --> 13:24.161
Brigadier General, because the general officers 
in that Air Assault Division were all pilots, and I

13:16.193 --> 13:24.161
wanted to stay. So you learned to fly a helicopter 
then? I learned to fly a helicopter, and I took the

13:27.344 --> 13:32.789
authority of the Chief of Staff of the Army to allow 
me to learn on the job. And then when I came home for a

13:33.449 --> 13:44.800
brief leave, I split leave with training at Fort 
Rucker, our aviation center, and then went and

13:33.449 --> 13:44.800
returned to the division and finished my 
training.

13:45.910 --> 13:49.495
I thought I gave them a good argument, but we in the 
end lost. But to me, I was in a position of telling

13:49.515 --> 14:11.247
people where to go and what to do in aircraft, and 
when I learned to fly and went through the rigors

13:49.515 --> 14:11.247
of—by the way, when I was at Fort Rucker, they made 
me fly as many hours as I could do it because I was

13:49.515 --> 14:11.247
there just for a short time. Of course, I had some 
ground instructions. But they really worked me to

14:14.733 --> 14:17.175
the point of fatigue.

14:19.677 --> 14:23.561
They had an excellent training program there 
specially made up for me. I had learned in Vietnam,

14:24.842 --> 14:30.707
and the classroom emphasizes it, of course, how 
important this maintenance is. And all you have to

14:30.747 --> 14:39.095
do is see a disaster that's a maintenance fault to 
realize what the responsibility for maintenance

14:30.747 --> 14:39.095
is. So anyway, I outlined to them that

14:46.458 --> 15:01.037
First of all, you need people who are basically 
oriented not on aviation but on the combat arms to

14:46.458 --> 15:01.037
qualify at some point in aviation and learn the 
potential of it. If you've got a man that's done

15:01.057 --> 15:13.073
nothing but fly, and the Army didn't have many of 
those, but he's not the man you need to put in a

15:01.057 --> 15:13.073
position of command in this expanded use of 
aviation. Well, when I learned to fly, I not only

15:14.875 --> 15:18.019
filled a cockpit, which was unimportant, but I 
did. I relieved another pilot. I had a co-pilot.

15:22.485 --> 15:33.100
But I knew in a much better defined way what I could 
ask people to do or expect people to do in terms of

15:22.485 --> 15:33.100
flying so many hours in certain conditions. I knew 
much better whether you could land on that rough

15:33.120 --> 15:40.410
hilltop or not, and therefore whether you should 
order them to do so. And I had a much greater respect

15:41.791 --> 15:46.356
for the maintenance of that aircraft. And I said, 
beyond that, if you're flying alone in an

15:46.376 --> 15:55.987
aircraft, for example, on this maintenance, 
you're very conscious of it, solo fires

15:46.376 --> 15:55.987
particularly. But I pointed out that when I joined 
the 1st Cavalry Division in 1941, everybody was on

15:57.909 --> 16:03.735
a horse. And the commanders, particularly the 
senior commanders, All the soldiers, well every

16:11.322 --> 16:17.691
commander, the soldiers expected that commander 
to be a good horseman. And can you imagine being in a

16:17.711 --> 16:25.202
horse-cower division and not being able to ride a 
horse? Well what's different in the flying

16:25.222 --> 16:29.268
aerosol division? What did the congressman 
think? Money? Money. Dollars were the answer. And

16:35.538 --> 16:39.203
of course at some point dollars always have to be 
the limit, you know. but anyway as a result that I

16:39.942 --> 16:47.473
thought very vital program was discontinued.

16:47.493 --> 16:48.435
You had another question. Yeah, I had some other 
questions about that job. Congressman, who were

16:52.661 --> 16:56.768
the- you dealt with the congressmen all the time. 
Who did you consider your friends from 68 to 70? Who

17:00.193 --> 17:02.997
were your enemies as far as the military was 
concerned? Who were people that would work for the

17:03.635 --> 17:07.880
armed services, and who were people who wouldn't? 
Well, I don't think we really had any enemies.

17:17.911 --> 17:32.207
Surprisingly enough,

17:17.911 --> 17:32.207
the members of the armed services committees in 
the House and the Senate, the members of the armed

17:17.911 --> 17:32.207
services appropriations subcommittees in the 
House and the Senate, felt very much the same

17:33.233 --> 17:41.986
responsibilities as our senior military leaders 
and secretaries felt. And they felt

17:42.006 --> 17:56.828
that they had to prepare themselves to present an 
authorization bill on the floor of the House and

17:42.006 --> 17:56.828
the Senate that they can justify and that they can 
back up and that they can win with. That's exactly

18:00.989 --> 18:04.695
what we've come to the Congress with to those 
committees. Now, we have to sell to the

18:05.516 --> 18:13.227
committees, and then they have to sell to their own 
house of the Congress on the Senate floor. So we're

18:13.768 --> 18:16.872
really, now they're not yes men by any means. No 
way. But it's interesting that those committees

18:18.955 --> 18:26.967
are a continuation of the process that we go 
through and a continuation of the responsibility

18:18.955 --> 18:26.967
felt the security of the nation that our military 
and civilian defense leaders feel. So you had

18:32.838 --> 18:35.282
close cooperation and coordination with those 
people. So we worked with them. You bet. But they'd

18:36.765 --> 18:40.191
challenge us any time. And any one of them could 
challenge us on a point or a program or whatever.

18:45.982 --> 18:47.484
Who'd you have a lot of respect for? Which one of the 
senators and congressmen? Well, I couldn't name

18:49.267 --> 18:51.670
them all. Let me just say this. First of all, of 
course, the chairman at the time I was there of the

18:53.913 --> 19:00.042
Armed Services Committee was Senator Russell, 
briefly. Succeeded by a no. He had just moved to

19:02.405 --> 19:04.228
appropriate. Senator John Stennis of 
Mississippi and Congressman Mendel Rivers of

19:04.248 --> 19:15.263
South Carolina was the House Committee chairman. 
We

19:16.407 --> 19:29.720
in the Army have always felt the Congress was not an 
obstructionist organization, but they were so

19:16.407 --> 19:29.720
that blame slow that they were sometimes 
discouraging.

19:32.883 --> 19:45.975
After two and a plus years of working with them and 
observing this process in actuality,

19:32.883 --> 19:45.975
I wound up with a tremendous respect for the 
Congress. Well, first of all, for our total

19:46.158 --> 19:49.602
system. I think the concept that

19:49.662 --> 20:03.339
our framers of the Constitution had was 
absolutely tremendous, and of course that's not a

19:49.662 --> 20:03.339
new observation.

20:05.883 --> 20:13.532
The military men tend to be standing off from this 
and not particularly understanding it, but it

20:05.883 --> 20:13.532
works very well. And the Congress itself, I left 
with a much vaster understanding of it and a very

20:14.542 --> 20:24.636
high regard for it. And the members of Congress,

20:24.836 --> 20:33.328
by and large, they're very hardworking people. I 
don't know of a body of people that work any harder,

20:33.428 --> 20:37.694
contrary to some popular belief. They're

20:37.714 --> 20:42.000
very conscientious. and they are there to serve 
the best interests of the United States, the

20:43.212 --> 20:49.961
people of the United States, and there's no doubt 
in my mind about it. Now, we see the crook

20:49.981 --> 21:11.852
occasionally, and we see the deviate 
occasionally, but as I've often said, if you threw

20:49.981 --> 21:11.852
a fishnet over a hundred people in Kauffman, 
Texas, and then looked at them individually,

20:49.981 --> 21:11.852
there were two or three of them you would not want to 
keep. And I think the same thing is just about in the

21:12.760 --> 21:18.469
same proportion in the Congress. There's two or 
three percent of them that we shouldn't keep. But I

21:25.459 --> 21:39.460
felt that there's

21:25.459 --> 21:39.460
absolutely nothing I would change except, if I 
could influence it, I would change the

21:40.925 --> 21:53.500
tediousness and the time-consuming process, 
just as I've criticized the decision, the

21:40.925 --> 21:53.500
slowness in decision time in the Army, or the 
Office of the Department of Defense. That's the

21:54.641 --> 21:57.364
only thing I would like to see change. So you had 
real close cooperation with congressmen. Oh,

22:02.410 --> 22:02.871
yes. We had our critics, of course, and we had our 
incidents, and we had our bad news out of them. but

22:09.427 --> 22:13.490
they're all very conscious of their 
responsibility for national security. Okay, you

22:14.491 --> 22:18.475
were in this job when President Nixon was just 
elected. Did you have an opportunity to meet the

22:19.556 --> 22:21.517
President? No, I never met Mr. Nixon personally. 
I've been in audience a time or two. For example,

22:30.405 --> 22:38.792
he came to the Pentagon shortly after he was 
inaugurated and made a talk to the General

22:39.262 --> 22:42.945
officer, general and flag officers, and 
secretary level people. And I must say I was

22:44.427 --> 22:46.549
impressed. And when you look back in retrospect, 
Mr. Nixon's long suit was foreign policy and

22:48.690 --> 22:59.380
national strategy.

23:06.567 --> 23:08.188
Why'd you resign from this job? That sounds like a 
fascinating job. I didn't resign. I retired.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.021
Well, that's what I meant. Yeah, Terry, I got you on 
a technicality there. As a matter of fact, I'm

23:19.867 --> 23:23.631
still, I was not, I didn't leave the Army. I was 
reassigned to the retired list, technically. I

23:30.700 --> 23:36.387
could be called tomorrow if they wanted me and 
needed me. Well, you had 1968 major general and two

23:36.923 --> 23:43.270
years later, then you retire. You had a number of 
years that you could have served. Yes, that's

23:47.715 --> 23:48.616
true. Why did you decide to retire then in 1970?

23:53.941 --> 23:57.565
Well, yes, I'd be glad to respond to that. It was not 
an easy decision, and we decided, Fran and I, gosh,

23:58.546 --> 24:06.475
I guess ten years before, decided

24:07.096 --> 24:23.478
that, really, we can go the 30 years in the Army, but 
we surely shouldn't go further given the ages of

24:07.096 --> 24:23.478
our children and the stages of life they'll be in, 
ready to start college at the end of that term. We

24:23.559 --> 24:25.681
started our family a little late, as you see. That 
was a conclusion we reached. I shouldn't have

24:30.108 --> 24:31.570
called that a decision. In Yugoslavia, then? We 
were at that time, I believe- at the War College,

24:36.695 --> 24:45.024
really you might say right up at the top of our 
career. And I don't know whether I've said this in

24:47.146 --> 25:00.261
this interview, but I think it's appropriate to 
say that we certainly did not leave the Army

24:47.146 --> 25:00.261
because we were unhappy or dissatisfied or 
anything. As a matter of fact, both of us will say

25:00.281 --> 25:03.985
that we never I can say I never had a bad assignment. 
And she would say, since we've been married, she

25:09.866 --> 25:15.791
never has experienced a bad assignment. And in 
thirty years, the last five months, I had one son of

25:15.811 --> 25:23.718
a bitch box, I think I've said that. We're going to 
get him, why don't you? And that's a pretty good

25:26.020 --> 25:27.342
record. Were you going to name him, or do you want to 
keep him? No, I'm not going to name him. Yeah, we're

25:29.664 --> 25:30.745
going to leave him alone. I think I'm very 
fortunate. I would say absolutely.

25:35.977 --> 25:51.114
Now having arrived where we were in the Pentagon, 
and as we approached our 30th year, we began

25:35.977 --> 25:51.114
thinking about this again. That was a fascinating 
assignment, and I don't know what was ahead, but we

25:51.155 --> 26:01.967
felt we should come to grips with this thing, and 
some of the contributing factors to our thinking

26:03.449 --> 26:09.277
was that this was really a very unpleasant time for 
our children. We were living, it appeared, in a

26:09.297 --> 26:16.327
very select location in Washington. We were 
quartered at Fort Myer, Virginia, very near the

26:16.387 --> 26:21.254
Pentagon, beautiful situation. Our children 
were being bused to schools in Arlington, which

26:22.035 --> 26:30.807
for years had been considered the finest school 
system in the nation. And some of the things that

26:32.339 --> 26:43.294
had happened to our children, which were by plays 
from integration, were just almost unbearable to

26:32.339 --> 26:43.294
me. The children didn't bother them that much. So I 
guess this kind of got us, this didn't cause us to

26:46.778 --> 26:53.968
leave, but it caused us to think again about this. 
And we could visualize that upon completion of

26:55.450 --> 27:00.557
this tour, Our oldest son was, we had two sons, two 
daughters. Our oldest son was a freshman in A&M at

27:06.575 --> 27:10.600
the time I retired. We could be sent to Timbuktu or 
the back end of Turkey with these four children at

27:12.763 --> 27:30.645
these ages and say have one in college in the United 
States and one in high school in Switzerland and

27:31.402 --> 27:37.230
American school in Ankara and us out at the back 
end. And so family became the real consideration

27:37.250 --> 27:40.074
here. And

27:41.697 --> 27:50.670
family had always been extremely important to me 
for reasons you've learned here. And I've

27:50.770 --> 27:59.923
mentioned here that my children are fifth 
generation on this, fifth generation backers on

27:50.770 --> 27:59.923
this land here. So I had to satisfy myself that I had

28:00.950 --> 28:09.940
fulfilled my duty. I could have remained another 
five years beyond the date of my retirement. Five

28:17.069 --> 28:20.472
and a half years.

28:21.594 --> 28:22.775
And maybe another promotion. Possibly another 
promotion. That was not a serious consideration.

28:31.375 --> 28:38.264
I was absolutely convinced the Vietnam War was 
over with as far as resolving it in our favor was

28:31.375 --> 28:38.264
concerned. And so I felt that obligation had been 
met. I had served there a year and a half.

28:49.639 --> 28:53.985
I felt that I wasn't that essential to the Army.

28:56.969 --> 28:57.990
We had all kinds of highly qualified people coming 
on. I'd had the privilege of sitting on general

29:04.503 --> 29:17.956
officer promotion boards, selecting officers 
for promotion in general, which is a very

29:04.503 --> 29:17.956
difficult thing to do.

29:21.059 --> 29:26.745
But it was a very satisfying

29:21.059 --> 29:26.745
experience because

29:28.733 --> 29:37.120
We could actually only select at that time for 
promotion a fraction of those who obviously were

29:28.733 --> 29:37.120
qualified. Well, you see, that's pretty 
comforting for the future of the nation. And so

29:43.246 --> 29:46.328
that's sort of a thing I rationalized. As a matter 
of fact,

29:47.069 --> 29:58.639
each month the general officer in the Army get a 
listing of all general officers and where they

29:47.069 --> 29:58.639
stand on the promotion list and where they are. you 
know, their assignments. And I, while I was doing

30:02.625 --> 30:12.557
this contemplating, I happened to pick that up one 
day and I started looking at it with a new

30:02.625 --> 30:12.557
perspective.

30:12.577 --> 30:28.677
I found among

30:12.577 --> 30:28.677
the listed major generals and brigadier 
generals, I counted 25 that

30:12.577 --> 30:28.677
I felt I had been instrumental in promoting. by my 
reports on them. So that made it easy. I'd replaced

30:35.732 --> 30:39.255
myself 25 times, you see. And by the way, one of the 
officers on that list is General Shia Meyer, who's

30:39.576 --> 30:48.225
now Chief of Staff of the Army. So anyway, after all 
these considerations, but basically with the

30:48.245 --> 30:56.453
view to keeping our family together, and getting 
them on home ground and letting their roots grow

30:58.475 --> 31:11.453
here,

30:58.475 --> 31:11.453
we decided we'd retire. We'd be moved to the 
retired list, and that's what we did. Did you ever

31:16.540 --> 31:21.748
find out what your next assignment might have 
been?

31:23.070 --> 31:23.430
Yes. Not specifically, but I was

31:28.816 --> 31:41.375
I was told that I was to receive command of a 
division when I left the Pentagon, that I had been

31:28.816 --> 31:41.375
tentatively placed on that list, and that was very 
gratifying to hear that. Because you had never

31:41.675 --> 31:43.218
had... I had never been assigned as commander of a 
division. I'd been assistant division commander

31:47.104 --> 31:51.911
of the 1st Cavalry, and I commanded it 
temporarily, but that's not the same. Well, of

31:53.994 --> 31:58.080
course, that was rather enticing, but we'd made 
our decision. And I might say, for whatever it was

31:59.140 --> 32:15.464
worth, and I'm not sure what it was worth, I 
commented on it in response, that I'd always had

31:59.140 --> 32:15.464
the objective of being a division commander. And 
that's one specific objective that I had had. And I

32:19.149 --> 32:28.523
wasn't disenchanted or out

32:19.149 --> 32:28.523
of sorts because I hadn't gotten one, but I pointed 
out, that in my experience in World War II in

32:30.106 --> 32:41.539
Vietnam, I was absolutely convinced that the Army 
should never assign an officer to command a

32:30.106 --> 32:41.539
division if he's over 50 years old. Now, that's an 
arbitrary thing to say, but I felt it should be, if

32:41.619 --> 32:48.087
much over 40, not much. How old were you at that 
time? I was 51. So did you feel yourself that you

32:53.613 --> 32:56.917
were too old to command the division? I felt I 
didn't put it that way. But I did leave the thought

33:00.143 --> 33:06.832
that they should assign younger officers to 
command divisions. Because the older we get,

33:06.852 --> 33:21.092
whether we really are ready to admit it or not, the 
mechanism is such that we become more

33:06.852 --> 33:21.092
conservative in our thinking and certainly more 
conservative in our doing. And the division, and

33:22.614 --> 33:28.682
by the way, this age thing relates right on down, in 
my opinion. The division is

33:29.523 --> 33:44.186
the optimum combined arms unit of the Army that 
brings all capabilities into play at the first

33:29.523 --> 33:44.186
time, first point. And those are very critical 
people, those guys that command divisions. And my

33:50.216 --> 33:57.167
observation of World War II at Vietnam was that 
those who were nearest to 40 were the finest

33:50.216 --> 33:57.167
commanders. I don't know whether that was taken 
seriously or not, but I did note after leaving that

33:59.071 --> 34:09.366
many of them were young 40s who were assigned, 
mid-40s. Now, that's not so much of you're

34:09.566 --> 34:21.223
deciding to do it, but it's a function, really, of 
the cycle in age versus grade in the Army, which is

34:09.566 --> 34:21.223
basically determined by wars, really. Do you 
remember the day that you retired? Very well. Tell

34:25.789 --> 34:26.310
me about it. Well,

34:28.855 --> 34:41.028
I had been offered a retirement ceremony at Fort 
Myer with the Old Guard 3rd Infantry Division

34:28.855 --> 34:41.028
during the honors. That was normal for a senior 
officer retiring from the Pentagon. That was the

34:46.474 --> 34:48.196
ceremonial unit there. And I declined 
gratefully,

34:50.559 --> 34:58.407
saying that I felt it appropriate only to retire 
with the unit ceremony if it were my unit.

35:08.465 --> 35:18.839
So, the retirement ceremony itself was held in the 
office of the Secretary of the Army, and Fran was

35:08.465 --> 35:18.839
there. The

35:18.859 --> 35:28.832
Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff and his 
assistant Chiefs of Staff and a few of my special

35:18.859 --> 35:28.832
friends were there for the ceremony. And it was 
very simple, but very nice. It sounds like it was

35:32.117 --> 35:33.498
very nice. Very nice. And I would love to have been 
retired at a union ceremony, but I honestly have

35:36.181 --> 35:50.535
always said,

35:36.181 --> 35:50.535
I don't want those fellows to be called out to march 
for me unless they've been my troops. Yeah. What

35:53.839 --> 35:55.140
were your feelings on that day? Well, we've never 
looked back on that decision, honestly. We've

35:59.649 --> 36:01.131
missed the Army a great deal. But of course, that is 
a, that's kind of like, to some degree, kind of like

36:01.451 --> 36:10.064
that final review at A&M, you know. It's a great 
chance. It's quite a partition.

36:17.474 --> 36:23.423
But we miss the Army often, and I think that's good. 
But we've never regretted this decision. As a

36:25.789 --> 36:39.404
matter of fact,

36:25.789 --> 36:39.404
these four kids of ours, we've succeeded maybe too 
well, in a sense, in getting this roots growing and

36:25.789 --> 36:39.404
orientation at home here. Fran and I have liked it. 
We thought we'd never get Chris out of the house.

36:48.293 --> 36:52.077
But they have become very attached to the point 
that

36:52.478 --> 37:02.412
perhaps there are better opportunities for them 
elsewhere, but they all determined to stay right

36:52.478 --> 37:02.412
around here. Our oldest son lives and works in 
Kauffman, and our younger son lives out here

37:03.654 --> 37:11.746
across the road from us and works in Kauffman. Our 
baby daughter just graduated from Sam Houston

37:11.846 --> 37:17.254
State University, just gone to work in Dallas, but 
she doesn't want to live further away than Dallas.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.664
She would like to move closer to her work there. And 
our older daughter is out at Woodville and can't

37:25.085 --> 37:31.053
come home often enough with her two youngsters. So 
that's been very gratifying. Incidentally, both

37:36.079 --> 37:39.764
our boys went to A&M. Chris didn't graduate, but 
they're also A&M products.

37:46.293 --> 37:48.055
Very avid Aggies. There's only two things more 
that I'd like to talk about. And one is leadership,

37:53.140 --> 37:56.463
and one is the two more things. One's leadership, 
and one is the change. Another is the changes that

38:00.847 --> 38:04.571
have taken place at A&M. Now I was wondering if 
you'd define leadership for me.

38:11.017 --> 38:14.781
Well, I'm sure there are different ways to define 
leadership. But to me, leadership is the

38:15.740 --> 38:36.449
demonstrated capacity to cause men to perform in 
the accomplishment of an objective, whether they

38:15.740 --> 38:36.449
really are

38:15.740 --> 38:36.449
fully oriented or not. The better you are in them, 
the better it is. It's causing things to happen,

38:40.855 --> 38:44.400
and happen correctly. Is that motivation? 
Motivation, when you start dissecting this

38:47.414 --> 38:58.990
leadership, I think

38:47.414 --> 38:58.990
it's in many parts.

39:01.393 --> 39:03.776
By the way, I don't think leaders are born, I think 
they're made. I think leaders are made through a

39:04.577 --> 39:16.273
series of accumulating experiences, dealing 
with others and causing others to act. and

39:16.996 --> 39:28.173
growing situations of magnitude and 
responsibility and so forth.

39:28.193 --> 39:30.917
Personality, of course, has something to do with 
it. I think in terms of leadership, character is

39:31.518 --> 39:45.940
very important for the leader to have and show 
without, you know, to be observed without him

39:31.518 --> 39:45.940
showing it off. I think knowledge of what you're 
about has got to be an extremely important aspect

39:47.455 --> 39:57.404
of it. Of course, in military leadership,

39:57.424 --> 40:11.518
the ability to make decisions,

39:57.424 --> 40:11.518
useful and sound decisions, in a timely way is very 
important. You know, it's an interesting thing.

40:17.746 --> 40:23.333
most difficult thing for some leaders is to make a 
decision.

40:23.353 --> 40:46.200
Now maybe we're getting back into this matter of 
conservatism versus risk, but leadership is

40:23.353 --> 40:46.200
something that you don't really develop so 
consciously by preparation, but by experience.

40:46.568 --> 40:54.558
almost has to be successful experience and 
accumulation of successful experiences to

40:46.568 --> 40:54.558
really be a top leader.

40:57.782 --> 41:00.045
I'm not saying that a failure is not acceptable. It 
is. Most of us fail at something. Sure. Is there a

41:04.370 --> 41:08.435
difference between military leadership and 
civilian leadership, do you think? I think

41:08.455 --> 41:11.158
they're basically the same. I think they're 
different in you know, and the objectives that

41:15.408 --> 41:19.653
are... What type of values should a leader have? 
What type of values? Well, that's a good point.

41:25.059 --> 41:26.340
That comes under character. I think that a leader 
has to be a man of high moral values. He's got to be

41:35.551 --> 41:37.853
just. My experience is that you can be just as tough 
as you want to be, as long as what you require your

41:43.252 --> 41:50.362
people to do is achievable and you're fair with 
them in doing that.

41:55.790 --> 41:57.532
So you have to be fair and just. How about flexible? 
Well, I think... You have to have knowledge.

42:05.123 --> 42:12.313
Flexibility, that's true, because situations 
change, but also you should be flexible in mind to

42:05.123 --> 42:12.313
the extent that you can accept... advice, 
recommendations, and new information that leads

42:13.036 --> 42:23.410
to your decisions.

42:23.430 --> 42:29.017
Flexibility is, of course, we can describe that 
against various terms, and when you get to the

42:23.430 --> 42:29.017
battlefield, it's a must. It's an absolute must. 
Are the people that become leaders in the

42:33.763 --> 42:39.651
military, are they people who are the most capable 
people? Well, this is sort of what we were talking

42:42.875 --> 42:45.358
about before. Are they the most capable or is it 
fate? Right there at the right time or is it a

42:48.521 --> 42:50.924
combination? What was more important in your 
life? I think it's a combination. As you can see, if

42:57.552 --> 43:05.301
you're at the right place at the right time, you've 
still got to perform. But if you don't get to that

43:07.238 --> 43:11.122
place, you're not seen. You're not given the 
opportunity to perform. And there's some

43:14.166 --> 43:21.434
variation and, of course,

43:14.166 --> 43:21.434
significance of jobs. And much of that is a matter 
of chance. Well, that leads to another question.

43:26.340 --> 43:32.487
In a bureaucracy like a corporation or the 
military, you feel that leaders are basically the

43:26.340 --> 43:32.487
same. Do you think that people advance because of 
their own work or because there's somebody else

43:33.007 --> 43:42.456
that's helping them along, or why? Well, there's 
no question but what people you've convinced on

43:44.798 --> 43:54.427
your own capabilities can help you. But at the same 
time, I'd hasten to add that I never considered

44:00.260 --> 44:05.748
what has been referred to as politics in the Army as 
being really significant. I don't think it is. Who

44:08.412 --> 44:17.726
you know is helpful in many cases, particularly 
after you become senior and you do know more people

44:08.412 --> 44:17.726
and more people know you. But I don't think that's 
essential at all. Now, where it is helpful is like

44:21.773 --> 44:28.022
when you get, for example, when a general officer 
takes command of a division, or a corps, or a higher

44:28.542 --> 44:32.246
headquarters. Oftentimes, he's given some

44:34.448 --> 44:43.097
leeway in the selection of his staff or his 
subordinate commanders. In peacetime, it's not

44:44.619 --> 44:46.300
very great. In fact, it's almost nil in most 
situations. In wartime, it makes more

44:52.206 --> 44:55.630
difference. If he's got three records or resumes 
of officers in front of him, and he knows one of

44:56.116 --> 45:05.245
them, and the records look about the same, who's he 
going to take? Sure. And to that extent, it makes a

45:06.606 --> 45:09.188
difference. Oftentimes, a senior commander, a 
senior general officer, having had experience

45:09.469 --> 45:24.503
with people, he'll just recall them and send a 
message watching, I'd like to have Joe Doakes to be

45:09.469 --> 45:24.503
my brigade commander. And this will work to some 
degree, but I don't think that that's the

45:26.238 --> 45:35.007
determination. Primarily, you feel it's the 
individual's record of work. I think so. You made

45:40.292 --> 45:46.018
general officer, which is the highest grade that 
you can make in the military. Would you consider

45:46.078 --> 45:52.164
yourself, or did you consider yourself during 
your career an ambitious officer? No, I didn't. In

45:57.845 --> 46:03.573
this regard, if we mean that I said I'm going to be a 
general officer, I never did. I had always felt

46:03.613 --> 46:11.585
that I'd like to be, but at the same time I realized I 
was going to get there one grade at a time if I got

46:03.613 --> 46:11.585
there. No, I think my orientation accepted me to do 
the best job I could when I had the job. Well, when

46:17.733 --> 46:25.945
you were 25, for example, did you say to yourself 
someday, and by that time you'd made up your mind

46:17.733 --> 46:25.945
you wanted a military career, someday I want to 
become a general officer. That's my goal? No, I

46:29.726 --> 46:31.228
never said that's my goal. I always felt that 
that's really the top. Sure, I'm going to keep

46:35.855 --> 46:38.999
moving in that direction as long as I can. And did 
you feel once you became general officer, once you

46:39.280 --> 46:52.118
became a brigadier, did you feel that now that you 
were a general that your expectations of what

46:39.280 --> 46:52.118
generals are like Do you think that you had a good 
idea what kind of a status a general has? Was it

46:59.261 --> 47:02.027
reinforced or was it refuted? No, to a great extent 
I had an understanding.
