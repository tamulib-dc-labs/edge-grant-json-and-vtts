WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:07.965
About five or six hours, I mean, five or six cents an hour.

00:08.746 --> 00:09.488
Wasn't very much.

00:10.449 --> 00:20.704
But we did get our eats, and that was, they would let us eat nearly anything except steaks or anything like that.

00:21.746 --> 00:24.830
Was the food over there as good as it was in Cebisa?

00:25.251 --> 00:28.275
Well, they had their own plates.

00:29.017 --> 00:30.038
For instance,

00:31.807 --> 00:41.121
They would have a meat and two vegetables and a drink and a slice of bread.

00:42.003 --> 00:48.333
And best that I can remember, they were all about forty to forty-five cents.

00:49.514 --> 00:54.422
And they had them up there.

00:55.027 --> 00:59.312
of meat and two vegetables.

00:59.872 --> 01:03.837
Number two, it had something else without meat and something else, you know.

01:04.778 --> 01:06.840
Had three specialties most of the time.

01:08.222 --> 01:09.683
And that's what we did.

01:09.723 --> 01:12.727
Normally, who stayed at the Aggieland Inn?

01:13.147 --> 01:14.809
Who were the people that were there?

01:14.829 --> 01:16.011
Well, just somebody.

01:16.551 --> 01:19.995
Army people back when I was there, mostly.

01:20.195 --> 01:21.777
Okay.

01:24.862 --> 01:38.801
And football weekends, that's where I met one of their great, great, great supporters of football.

01:42.887 --> 01:48.054
Name was Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F.

01:48.775 --> 01:54.042
And he and Norton got together in 1934.

01:54.764 --> 01:57.809
And I met him in the fall of 35.

02:00.413 --> 02:03.017
Describe Coach Norton, personality.

02:03.658 --> 02:10.328
Well, I didn't know him much until after I graduated.

02:10.348 --> 02:22.847
But they didn't have any trouble filling those

02:23.688 --> 02:32.920
30 rooms, you know, during a football weekend or anything special, Mother's Day or whatever they had.

02:32.981 --> 02:39.149
During those three years you worked there, do you remember any celebrities spending the night at the Aggieland Inn?

02:39.469 --> 02:40.350
Any famous people?

02:42.393 --> 02:49.042
In 1937, Roosevelt came here.

02:50.524 --> 02:53.408
In spring of 37,

02:54.080 --> 03:01.331
got in his car and had his celebrities running by the side of the car.

03:02.332 --> 03:08.080
And he drove down through the military.

03:09.763 --> 03:11.045
Military wall.

03:17.013 --> 03:19.096
They had a drill for him.

03:20.578 --> 03:21.640
And I can remember

03:22.210 --> 03:29.561
right across the street, because I was watching out the window.

03:30.562 --> 03:42.740
And old Ed Lee, which was commanding officer of the students at that time, he rode in that open car with him.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.627
And that lasted a couple of hours, and then he left.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.862
But that was the biggest thing.

03:50.443 --> 03:53.146
Did he, he didn't stay at the Aggieland, though?

03:53.166 --> 03:54.227
No, no, no.

03:55.068 --> 03:59.153
Were you and your buddies aware that President Roosevelt was crippled?

04:00.014 --> 04:01.636
Oh, yes, they told us, yeah.

04:02.177 --> 04:04.480
But you didn't see him in a wheelchair or anything?

04:04.500 --> 04:05.461
No, no, he was in his car.

04:06.823 --> 04:08.425
I never saw him get out of his car.

04:09.787 --> 04:15.994
They came, had a special train, you know, that he drove in, or rode in.

04:17.696 --> 04:18.137
And, uh,

04:20.092 --> 04:25.440
It was quite an event to see the President of the United States on A&M campus.

04:26.101 --> 04:29.225
Were there any other famous celebrities that came during those years?

04:32.710 --> 04:39.761
Well, I'm sure there were some... Well, that's all we had then was military people.

04:41.143 --> 04:43.586
All right, back to your being a student.

04:43.686 --> 04:44.948
What outfit were you in?

04:45.569 --> 04:46.791
I was in...

04:47.345 --> 04:54.953
engineer my freshman year, and B Battery Field Artillery the next three years.

04:54.973 --> 04:57.075
Describe that outfit and what it was like.

04:57.155 --> 05:13.572
Well, they had, at that time, they had so many different

05:15.695 --> 05:36.066
They was divided up my second year, I believe, and second year they divided a few artillery up because there was more than that, except infantry.

05:36.552 --> 05:38.717
Everybody wanted to get in the infancy, you know.

05:41.383 --> 05:55.675
And so anyway, they had every Wednesday, we had a drill.

05:57.578 --> 06:26.893
We'd get out there and ride those old caissons and pieces and on a lot of the land that the wife's father worked, they called it Scotes Field up there, about where our motel was.

06:27.312 --> 06:52.948
up there and next to the highway you're saying uh north of the campus on the west side of texas avenue next to the highway on highway six when i got here in 34 highway six wasn't here on that side of the campus it was on on the west and the south side and and uh

06:53.907 --> 07:12.356
They were working on it, but it wasn't quite completed down when the old Highway 6 went through Welburn and met just before they got to the Navisota River down there.

07:12.376 --> 07:14.860
Describe the campus when you arrived.

07:15.121 --> 07:18.726
What were the main, what were the big important buildings?

07:20.649 --> 07:21.130
Well.

07:23.675 --> 07:27.881
We had, we called it the old main building, you know, with the big dome.

07:27.901 --> 07:28.442
Academic.

07:28.802 --> 07:31.286
Academic.

07:32.127 --> 07:34.630
And a lot of those buildings are still there.

07:35.391 --> 07:38.175
The chemistry building has been increased.

07:38.896 --> 07:50.492
The petroleum engineering building was being a new building and the one that

07:51.164 --> 07:58.534
I don't know what they call us building now, where you go, turn in off of Highway 6, go up to the main building.

07:58.574 --> 08:00.356
What we used to call the system building.

08:00.376 --> 08:01.097
System building.

08:01.117 --> 08:01.758
Was it there?

08:01.959 --> 08:02.840
Yeah, it was there.

08:04.242 --> 08:04.762
It was new.

08:04.782 --> 08:14.235
Her father that had built the Ag Engineering Building was a new building.

08:14.620 --> 08:18.904
All right, out there where the golf course is now, was that still a part of?

08:18.924 --> 08:21.647
Well, that was where they kept the cattle.

08:21.787 --> 08:23.088
That was still the cow pasture?

08:23.108 --> 08:24.089
The cow pasture.

08:24.249 --> 08:25.250
And the horse pasture?

08:25.530 --> 08:27.192
And the horse pasture.

08:27.412 --> 08:43.868
And where she lived, right across the street there, was where the pigs and the cows and where the

08:45.637 --> 08:48.922
The modern fire was built the last couple, three years.

08:49.362 --> 08:56.672
That was Dr. Marstella's veterinary sick cattle or horses or something.

08:56.993 --> 08:58.956
That's where they stayed.

09:00.758 --> 09:03.342
Now, back to your outfit.

09:03.382 --> 09:05.385
What was the nickname of your artillery outfit?

09:05.405 --> 09:08.549
Did you all have a nickname, your corps outfit?

09:09.450 --> 09:10.452
Not that I know of.

09:11.694 --> 09:14.918
Did you make some friendships in that outfit that lasted?

09:16.248 --> 09:18.031
Yeah, and they're mostly gone, too.

09:18.071 --> 09:23.199
I lost one with the little Higginbotham just last year.

09:23.259 --> 09:35.137
And my best man at my wedding, Oscar Long, he passed away about two or three months ago.

09:36.899 --> 09:44.010
John Bone, George Birch, and those Wichita Falls boys were

09:46.724 --> 10:08.597
All Gone, Tom Murrow is gone, and he was aâ€”I had more friends, I believe, in that band, and that was the most of all of the people that I really was real close to.

10:09.893 --> 10:11.555
Well, hell, I worked a little time.

10:12.016 --> 10:14.860
You know, six days when you got a little time.

10:15.521 --> 10:25.173
I can remember one day I had, in fact, I saw in the paper the other day where he passed away up in Stevenville.

10:26.555 --> 10:30.781
Joe Davis, Colonel Joe Davis passed away.

10:30.801 --> 10:33.765
I don't know whether you ever remember him or not.

10:33.785 --> 10:38.331
Then it wasn't, he just passed away the last month or two.

10:39.982 --> 10:55.404
He saw me one day, I was running across, at noon the band always played as you marked, they marked in the, and I was running across there, I was running a little late, and I had my whole uniform on.

10:56.045 --> 11:00.471
And he hollered at me, and he goes, hey, Ed, come over here.

11:01.430 --> 11:05.060
And I went over and ran over and stopped and saluted him.

11:05.902 --> 11:07.687
He said, what can I do for you?

11:08.309 --> 11:11.457
He said, I just wanted to see what you look like in a uniform.

11:14.505 --> 11:16.992
You know, when you're working six hours a day,

11:17.377 --> 11:20.041
That's about the only time they ever get to see you.

11:20.462 --> 11:23.126
You got an old white jacket on.

11:24.608 --> 11:30.757
But anyway, that was... In your outfit, what did y'all take pride in?

11:30.877 --> 11:33.441
What was important about your outfit?

11:35.304 --> 11:42.154
Well, as far as I know... Chick Sale was in mind.

11:42.475 --> 11:44.297
Mm-hmm.

11:44.317 --> 11:44.818
And...

11:48.022 --> 11:49.944
I don't know of anything special.

11:50.605 --> 11:57.814
There were a lot of different groups of boys from different areas.

12:01.358 --> 12:11.870
And most of the boys, I believe in my area, in my outfit, was Houston.

12:11.890 --> 12:13.312
From Houston?

12:13.332 --> 12:14.974
Were they rich, poor?

12:16.692 --> 12:23.322
Well, the ones that I knew weren't, some had a lot more money.

12:23.803 --> 12:31.034
And you didn't, you know, when, you don't, that didn't ever seem to bother.

12:34.138 --> 12:41.970
Let's see, when you and your buddies, did you all ever pull any pranks, any jokes, any aggie good bull?

12:42.892 --> 12:43.813
No, I didn't.

12:45.278 --> 12:46.399
I just never did.

12:46.419 --> 12:51.445
I was either going to school or I was working.

12:53.747 --> 12:54.748
And I had to work.

12:56.590 --> 13:03.498
That money that you had saved and then you're working, about how much did a year of here cost?

13:03.518 --> 13:04.098
Do you remember?

13:05.880 --> 13:11.927
I believe it was a year

13:13.983 --> 13:18.870
I believe your meals were, I believe, about thirty dollars a month.

13:21.334 --> 13:26.140
And it seemed like laundry was ten dollars.

13:28.544 --> 13:34.152
That's about as close as I can remember, the laundry and the eats.

13:35.330 --> 13:40.297
So that your working in the dining hall paid only about half?

13:40.798 --> 13:44.483
Well, it paid $30 in Cebiza.

13:44.764 --> 13:47.388
Oh, so it pretty well paid your way.

13:48.810 --> 13:58.444
But when I went to work over there, I got my eats and $15 a month.

14:00.647 --> 14:04.172
And after my junior year,

14:07.747 --> 14:20.468
I got a deal that, uh, I got, uh, it was a death blotter.

14:21.931 --> 14:34.311
And, uh, and the man down at, uh, at Athletic Halvis had charge of all those payrolls then.

14:37.312 --> 14:58.459
He ate up for lunch every day, and one day I asked him, he had somebody that had it a year or two before.

14:59.013 --> 15:08.146
And I asked him if I could, he would let me have the chance of selling those blotters.

15:08.947 --> 15:14.675
But it was a blotter about eighteen by twenty-four.

15:16.557 --> 15:27.332
And it was a, what I did, I put, I made me a big T on the inside.

15:27.802 --> 15:31.106
Divided it up into little different advertising sections.

15:32.107 --> 15:38.756
And the ones that were in the T, they would be two or three dollars higher.

15:39.337 --> 15:44.143
Then on each side I had the football and the basketball schedule.

15:44.623 --> 15:45.925
I had that for two years.

15:46.786 --> 15:50.831
And I'd sell them for ten cents a blotter.

15:51.412 --> 15:52.774
It was just a regular blotter.

15:53.735 --> 15:54.636
And a nice one.

15:55.477 --> 16:04.426
And some of them wanted to sell them, go around to the different rooms and sell them.

16:04.446 --> 16:07.770
I'd let them have nickel and I'd keep a nickel.

16:09.251 --> 16:14.797
And I just did different things.

16:15.718 --> 16:25.348
One time, one of my good friends that was with me at the mess hall, I mean over at the

16:26.257 --> 16:29.941
at the Aggieland Inn was named Igo, Harry Igo.

16:30.842 --> 16:44.058
In fact, he was just down here not long ago, gave $50,000 for one of the pillows, and he's pretty well lost.

16:44.078 --> 16:48.483
He and I were roommates during the summertime.

16:49.504 --> 16:51.166
He was in the infantry in the fall.

16:52.708 --> 16:54.610
In fact, I'm surprised that

16:55.231 --> 16:57.233
He generally calls me about once a week.

16:59.255 --> 17:09.445
But anyway, we had an old boy that had bought a wagon load of watermelons.

17:09.465 --> 17:11.207
This was in the summertime.

17:12.808 --> 17:15.151
And we bought them from him for ten cents a piece.

17:15.571 --> 17:18.114
We must have had fifty, seventy-five watermelons.

17:19.415 --> 17:23.719
And we put them up there in Hart Hall.

17:24.948 --> 17:28.272
You had a commode and a shower between two rooms.

17:29.854 --> 17:32.057
And we called it shower-cooled watermelons.

17:32.097 --> 17:33.279
We'd sell them for a quarter.

17:34.681 --> 17:41.950
Joe Davis called us in one day, said, have you all been selling these watermelons?

17:41.970 --> 17:43.252
Yes, sir.

17:43.272 --> 17:49.640
Well, you got to stop now because they're just leaving them out on the ground.

17:53.225 --> 17:54.887
And that little lady right out there,

17:55.357 --> 18:06.149
When we had a blind date or a date after a while, the first one was a blind date, but after that one, she knew she was going to get to eat a watermelon.

18:09.212 --> 18:17.381
But that's one of the ways that I'd sell during the football season, I'd sell seats.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.427
There was a, then it, the,

18:23.521 --> 18:32.276
athletic department owned those seats, owned metal seats and had a cushion in them and fit under them.

18:32.296 --> 18:36.222
I'd sell those and made a dime every seat.

18:37.705 --> 18:49.545
But when I graduated from here, there wasn't a head of the department

18:50.588 --> 18:59.760
or any of those instructors over there that when I walked up into their room, they invited me in.

19:00.201 --> 19:02.384
There wasn't one of them that didn't know my name.

19:04.046 --> 19:09.013
Because they had eaten there at Aggieland M for three years, you know.

19:09.774 --> 19:14.000
And I'd waited on them.

19:14.500 --> 19:18.205
I really had a lot, lots of good.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.308
In fact, Dr. Walton,

19:22.887 --> 19:40.887
and Schleserman, and, and Dean Kyle, we've all gone duck and dove hunting together, so.

19:41.488 --> 19:43.871
Describe those, describe those people.

19:44.311 --> 19:49.317
Describe Dr. Walton and what was he like?

19:50.005 --> 20:08.593
Well, I was always impressed with him, but we used to hunt along the old Little Brazos River before it went into the big lot.

20:08.773 --> 20:17.346
There used to be a lot of, well, in fact, I guess there's still a lot of farming out there, but there's a lot of doves out there.

20:22.962 --> 20:25.285
Dr. Dan Russell.

20:26.186 --> 20:27.387
Oh, I could just.

20:27.407 --> 20:29.290
Let's see, you mentioned Skipper Schleselman.

20:29.630 --> 20:32.053
You remember, you know, remember Skipper?

20:32.353 --> 20:34.216
Describe him, please.

20:34.236 --> 20:37.379
Oh, I thought he was one of the, he was great.

20:41.244 --> 20:52.918
My senior year, after I met her, my junior year, in the summer of my junior year,

20:53.523 --> 21:02.012
And the second half of my senior year, I wasn't doing very good because I was spending too much time down there.

21:03.534 --> 21:12.865
And so she was her daddy's secretary, and he was in charge of those boys that weren't doing very good.

21:14.626 --> 21:22.315
So I got a letter from him.

21:22.970 --> 21:33.441
She had written and said I wanted to meet him in his office after 7.30, after I got off work.

21:33.461 --> 21:35.023
And he said, I'll tell you one thing.

21:35.043 --> 21:38.327
If you don't start doing better, you ain't coming down.

21:38.347 --> 21:40.910
He said, you ain't coming down to the house anymore.

21:43.092 --> 21:46.416
So I got with her, and she and I worked.

21:46.456 --> 21:51.862
So you couldn't have a date with his daughter unless you improved your grade.

21:51.882 --> 21:52.302
That's right.

21:52.771 --> 21:53.733
That's what he told me.

21:55.857 --> 22:01.367
And it was a long way from here to Milner Hall.

22:02.269 --> 22:05.495
Because that road out there, it was an old gravel road.

22:08.040 --> 22:12.568
And there weren't any lights on the campus much.

22:13.831 --> 22:23.623
But anyway, but you get Skipper, he was, Dan Russell was, you just couldn't ask for anything.

22:23.663 --> 22:24.804
Describe him, please.

22:25.065 --> 22:26.487
He was, he was a good one.

22:27.888 --> 22:28.089
And.

22:28.629 --> 22:29.911
Did you take a course from him?

22:29.951 --> 22:31.252
Took a course from him.

22:31.373 --> 22:31.893
What was it?

22:34.536 --> 22:35.618
Rural sociology?

22:35.898 --> 22:39.062
It was a rural sociology, but I don't remember the number of it.

22:40.747 --> 22:44.672
I've heard stories that it was easy to pass his course.

22:45.953 --> 22:46.474
Yes, sir.

22:48.516 --> 22:49.037
It was.

22:49.217 --> 22:49.678
It was.

22:51.440 --> 22:57.347
He had another fellow in his name, Dan Davis.

23:00.130 --> 23:09.842
I took a course, old Harry Igo and I took a course under him right after one o'clock class.

23:10.514 --> 23:18.963
And then there weren't any, any air conditioner or any, you see, pull up all the windows as high as they get.

23:19.864 --> 23:28.853
And after he read everybody's name off and they answered, well, he'd start writing something on them.

23:29.414 --> 23:38.563
Old Harry and I would leave.

23:40.197 --> 23:43.421
in the Animal Hudson River 107, Dahlberg.

23:44.823 --> 23:47.546
I don't mind, I bet he wasn't here when he was here.

23:54.494 --> 23:56.537
I met lots and lots of good people.

23:57.458 --> 24:01.683
And did, when y'all would slip out like that, would he catch you sometimes?

24:01.803 --> 24:06.289
No, he finally did, right at the end.

24:06.449 --> 24:09.833
Dahlberg was, but Dan Davis never did.

24:12.057 --> 24:18.148
That first fall, describe what it was like to go to your first Aggie football games.

24:18.689 --> 24:19.570
Well, I didn't go.

24:19.590 --> 24:25.361
I sold the, because I didn't have any money to go.

24:26.683 --> 24:31.732
And I think then there were two or two and a half for a football game.

24:32.734 --> 24:33.956
That's about all they were.

24:34.737 --> 24:36.360
I'd sell those seats.

24:36.847 --> 24:38.990
So you worked at the games?

24:39.110 --> 24:40.212
Yeah, I worked at the games.

24:40.232 --> 24:41.894
Did you start that your freshman year?

24:41.994 --> 24:45.359
Started my sophomore year.

24:47.301 --> 24:57.295
I found out who you get to sell them for.

24:57.335 --> 25:00.820
Right, your freshman year, you went to the games?

25:01.501 --> 25:06.668
No, I didn't go to the games, but there was upperclassmen

25:07.728 --> 25:11.413
They didn't have very good football.

25:11.433 --> 25:20.785
I think one of the games that year, they played A&I, if I'm not mistaken, and they tied them that year.

25:21.105 --> 25:22.687
It was bad, bad.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.511
Did the sophomores get on to you for not going to the games?

25:26.192 --> 25:27.954
They'd make you guess at every game.

25:29.216 --> 25:34.022
And every point you missed, while you had to,

25:35.133 --> 25:40.719
I lived in Mitchell and the hall was all the way around on the inside.

25:40.759 --> 25:44.343
You had to walk all the way around it.

25:44.683 --> 25:45.244
Duck walk?

25:45.624 --> 25:47.967
Oh, terrible.

25:48.628 --> 25:51.931
It sure did.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.453
All right.

25:55.615 --> 25:58.238
What about bonfire when you were a freshman?

25:58.298 --> 26:00.280
Describe bonfire in those days.

26:03.010 --> 26:05.493
Well, you just picked up anything you could.

26:06.114 --> 26:16.086
Most of it was either those old railroad ties that they had pulled out and put new ones in, you'd get some of those.

26:16.667 --> 26:24.237
And back there then, most of your packages and stuff came in wooden crates, and we used that.

26:24.257 --> 26:28.562
And I'll never forget.

26:29.774 --> 26:41.408
One, and I don't know which year it was, but Railway Express had these wagons that had metal wheels on them.

26:42.810 --> 26:50.599
And we got one of them and pulled it up University Drive.

26:50.659 --> 26:55.345
Then it wasn't, I don't know, more likely, it was just an old dirt road.

26:56.486 --> 26:59.730
And crossed the highway now.

27:00.453 --> 27:20.301
there was an old house over in the cotton field and we went over there and pushed that thing up there and loaded it up and got nearly into the back one of the rooms and there was a colored man back there and he'd been sleeping in that house.

27:23.545 --> 27:28.452
And Dr. Walton found out about it and he made everybody

27:29.444 --> 27:34.230
on the campus put in a nickel in favor of that old house.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.351
I'll never forget that.

27:35.391 --> 27:43.120
Now how long in gathering up the stuff for the bonfire, how long did y'all work on it?

27:45.143 --> 27:45.463
I don't know.

27:45.503 --> 27:46.204
Two or three days?

27:48.006 --> 27:51.030
I don't know how long it is because

27:51.466 --> 27:53.529
5, 5, 5.30.

27:53.689 --> 27:55.692
I was working every day.

27:56.372 --> 27:59.256
And the bonfire was held on the drill field?

27:59.396 --> 28:02.120
On the old drill field.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.584
Always was there every year that I can remember.

28:06.265 --> 28:10.791
Did anybody during your days try to sabotage the bonfire?

28:11.973 --> 28:19.903
They had an airplane come over one night and try to douse it with some gasoline, but it

28:20.457 --> 28:22.499
and didn't do a very good job.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.122
That's the only time I can ever remember.

28:25.623 --> 28:35.893
I remember one time with an A&M boy, and that was after I got out of school, and I was married then, and it was over there.

28:36.734 --> 28:47.646
Even the MSC was built, and he was just going to die, vomit, and take off, and engines,

28:50.039 --> 28:54.264
Let's see, do you remember going to Silver Taps the first time?

28:57.428 --> 28:58.929
What was Silver Taps like then?

29:00.491 --> 29:07.440
Well, I'm assuming, I haven't been to one in many, many, many years, but I'm assuming it's a whole lot like it was then.

29:07.880 --> 29:17.211
Then they'd get up on the old main building there and everybody would

29:18.558 --> 29:20.060
Turn off all of their lights.

29:22.023 --> 29:23.385
But I don't know about it now.

29:24.867 --> 29:26.148
Did you all take it seriously?

29:26.169 --> 29:26.709
Sure did.

29:28.372 --> 29:31.095
And that first fall, did you go home at all?

29:32.397 --> 29:35.662
I went home Christmas.

29:36.783 --> 29:37.444
How'd you get there?

29:39.046 --> 29:44.514
Well, I was going with a girl that she was going to T.S.

29:44.894 --> 29:47.518
I don't know what, it was CIA the first year.

29:48.224 --> 29:48.724
up there.

29:49.185 --> 29:53.629
She was going, and that's where she went after her first year here.

29:55.511 --> 30:00.876
She went one year here in 33 one whole year, she and her sister.

30:02.057 --> 30:03.118
There were 11 of them.

30:04.900 --> 30:15.210
And that was the year that the state had lowered the teacher's salaries 25 percent.

30:16.591 --> 30:19.899
And then the Texas was broke.

30:19.919 --> 30:23.046
And they had served them warrants.

30:24.710 --> 30:31.005
But anyway, I went that year and then I never went back.

30:32.234 --> 30:33.336
Anymore than anymore.

30:34.097 --> 30:38.142
But did you go home at Christmas on the train?

30:38.182 --> 30:44.291
No, they met me and the girl and her mother picked me up in Dallas.

30:44.311 --> 30:45.993
I highwayed it up to Dallas.

30:46.634 --> 30:47.936
They picked me up in Dallas.

30:48.917 --> 30:56.588
And then the boy from Chillicothe, Raymond Igbosom, we'd get together and we'd highway back from

30:57.260 --> 30:58.741
Vernon together.

30:58.761 --> 31:01.384
All right, describe hitchhiking in those days.

31:02.065 --> 31:06.649
Oh, it wasn't too good.

31:09.332 --> 31:13.296
But if you don't, be sure you wore your uniform.

31:16.159 --> 31:19.983
And how long would it take to get from Vernon down?

31:23.206 --> 31:26.389
I just don't have any idea.

31:26.808 --> 31:42.080
I can remember one time that I got to Forrest Denton with one of these friends that was going to North Texas.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.804
I stayed all night with him.
