00:02.680 --> 00:05.824
Lloyd affected that whole idea, cultivated it.

00:06.745 --> 00:11.051
The way he wore his clothes and things caused people.

00:11.631 --> 00:13.013
Some people call him high pockets.

00:13.053 --> 00:16.578
Another thing he had was high pockets because he wore his pants so short.

00:17.639 --> 00:30.055
One thing I think the reason why Dr. Nance was always kind of in awe of Lloyd because Lloyd spoke two or three languages and Dr. Nance was an old farm boy and Lloyd was

00:30.558 --> 00:34.805
from Ivy League school and spoke two or three languages and came from an old family.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.449
And Dr. Nance appreciated it, I think, along the way.

00:38.170 --> 00:44.640
And don't I remember occasionally Lloyd would name drop of some Eastern families that he knew?

00:44.860 --> 00:45.381
Oh, yes.

00:45.922 --> 00:48.086
He double dated with Jacqueline Kennedy one time.

00:48.106 --> 00:52.212
He made a great point to let you know that he had known a lot of people like that then, yes.

00:52.411 --> 00:55.556
And he knew all about French wines and cuisine.

00:55.576 --> 00:55.876
Yes, good food.

00:56.297 --> 00:57.719
He ate the Texans once a week.

00:58.440 --> 01:05.131
They frequently, which was a great restaurant in College Station Bryan, and they frequently tried out new recipes on him.

01:05.771 --> 01:07.174
Now he lived where?

01:07.494 --> 01:14.605
On Church Street in a one-room apartment with a bathroom off the side.

01:15.057 --> 01:22.209
The light was a single light bulb hanging down from the ceiling, and that was it.

01:22.229 --> 01:25.995
And he, in his office, I remember he had succulents.

01:26.375 --> 01:27.918
He raised succulents.

01:27.938 --> 01:35.210
He collected paintings, and he collected women.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.597
Lloyd wrote about women, and his books were all on females.

01:39.830 --> 01:42.393
And he was a great collector of female painters.

01:42.473 --> 01:44.295
In fact, he had some very famous paintings.

01:44.655 --> 01:49.080
One of his paintings, a Peggy Bacon painting, was actually in the Smithsonian.

01:49.141 --> 01:55.848
They came, I remember very clearly, they came down, boxed that thing, and shipped it up to Washington where it went on display for a while.

01:56.709 --> 02:00.173
One of those paintings is in the dean's office now, a very famous one.

02:00.293 --> 02:02.456
Describe what you remember about his death.

02:04.198 --> 02:07.982
Lloyd was out, I saw Lloyd, I was getting ready to go to a book signing.

02:08.022 --> 02:09.043
There was a book signing.

02:09.547 --> 02:15.973
When you get ready to do something like that you can't remember names then.

02:16.714 --> 02:18.716
Our future president from Rice.

02:19.437 --> 02:20.358
Oh Frank Vandiver.

02:20.378 --> 02:24.182
Frank Vandiver was having a book signing over in the old board house.

02:25.403 --> 02:36.314
Wardlaw was there and I was walking over that because I had Black Jack Pershing the book, two volumes, and so I was going to walk over and have him sign that for me.

02:36.654 --> 02:39.537
And I was walking out the hall and I saw Lloyd and I waved at him.

02:39.938 --> 02:42.962
And he was getting ready to go run as he was wanting to do in the afternoon.

02:43.382 --> 02:44.444
And I went on to my meeting.

02:45.425 --> 02:49.430
And that night, I forget exactly what time it was, but it was fairly late, 910 o'clock.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.492
Keith Bryant was our head at that time.

02:51.873 --> 02:56.118
And I received a phone call from Keith Bryant telling me that Lloyd Taylor had died.

02:56.538 --> 03:04.729
He was out jogging on the track at that time in the Coliseum there, Kyle Field.

03:05.409 --> 03:07.532
And he evidently fell over.

03:08.002 --> 03:12.308
And when he was found he was still alive, they rushed him to the hospital, but he died.

03:12.348 --> 03:23.285
The Nina Harris or Nina Harris Ashcraft was at the hospital at the time and she was there after it all happened.

03:24.146 --> 03:27.070
And as far as I understand, they never knew why he had died.

03:28.052 --> 03:30.415
Nina thought it was probably a heart attack.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.298
But some people thought it was a stroke and.

03:33.739 --> 03:34.800
He was in his 50s?

03:34.820 --> 03:36.041
50s, uh-huh, yeah.

03:36.541 --> 03:37.883
Middle 50s.

03:38.143 --> 03:44.549
In hindsight, he may have consumed a little too much alcohol.

03:45.110 --> 03:46.331
He was a very heavy drinker.

03:46.912 --> 03:48.994
And one reason why he ran, he drank every day.

03:49.034 --> 03:53.678
And he ran, he would tell you that, he ran to keep himself clean.

03:54.639 --> 03:58.283
And Lloyd was always very red faced, if you remember that then.

03:58.323 --> 03:59.964
But he did not smoke as far as.

03:59.984 --> 04:00.705
Did not smoke.

04:01.057 --> 04:22.744
smoked very much anyway he didn't smoke and he ran every day and he looked in fit condition if you remember he didn't have an ounce of fat on him that most of us even had some by that time he ran every day and he ran a long way every day I don't remember do you remember any other tragedies in the department yes we had a

04:23.922 --> 04:28.186
The, the, you know, the individual who died in his office, and I cannot remember his name now.

04:28.766 --> 04:29.427
You were still here.

04:29.907 --> 04:40.857
His office was down there on the west, on the east end of the building, on the curve there, and he was brought in to teach Latin America.

04:40.877 --> 04:44.320
He was only here for a couple years, and he died in his office.

04:45.021 --> 04:45.941
Yes, okay.

04:45.961 --> 04:48.604
And we, by that time, we were in, we were still in Nagle Hall.

04:49.104 --> 04:52.427
By that time, the dean had moved out to academic, and we had taken over the center.

04:52.694 --> 04:58.701
I remember very clearly Dr. Nance coming into the center office there and calling his wife and I do not remember his name.

04:59.241 --> 05:00.503
He was only here for a short time.

05:01.744 --> 05:06.529
And that's a, and then of course Al Ashcraft had a stroke in his office.

05:06.749 --> 05:07.991
We're not really sure what it was.

05:08.071 --> 05:08.651
No one ever knew.

05:09.092 --> 05:13.897
He had a stroke or a heart attack in his office and he was taken to the hospital.

05:14.538 --> 05:15.419
Hill was head then.

05:15.979 --> 05:17.041
He was taken to the hospital.

05:18.462 --> 05:20.024
Al was retiring that summer.

05:20.064 --> 05:22.026
He was getting ready to start his last

05:22.293 --> 05:25.116
semester, and he had the attack there.

05:25.657 --> 05:26.738
He never recovered from it.

05:28.180 --> 05:30.042
He recovered very briefly, then deteriorated.

05:31.985 --> 05:33.687
And that's all I can remember now.

05:34.488 --> 05:34.688
All right.

05:34.708 --> 05:46.022
Let's jump back to the 60s and the changes at A&M, the proposals for women and non-compulsory corps and so forth.

05:46.373 --> 05:53.200
What did you and your faculty colleagues think about those prospective changes at A&M?

05:53.921 --> 05:56.843
As far as I know, all faculty members were in favor of letting women in.

05:57.844 --> 06:04.011
And all faculty members, as far as I know, were against the Corps being compulsory.

06:04.031 --> 06:11.398
And even Al Ashcraft, who had been in the Corps and was an old Aggie, Alan thought it should be non-compulsory.

06:11.418 --> 06:12.499
What about racial integration?

06:13.154 --> 06:15.839
Everyone thought that would take place.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.165
I don't remember ever hearing anybody argue on that one.

06:19.185 --> 06:19.365
No.

06:19.806 --> 06:23.914
In fact, you could argue that racial integration was easier than women.

06:24.595 --> 06:30.005
After all, they were boys, you know, even let in, and girls were a bigger issue than letting black males in.

06:30.626 --> 06:31.948
And admission requirements.

06:32.830 --> 06:36.276
Well, most faculty members believe they should be raised.

06:36.728 --> 06:49.628
At that time, I don't know what they were, but we were letting, I think, if you were, whatever percentage you were of your high school class, it really didn't make any difference what you made on any scores on any exams that you could get in.

06:49.688 --> 06:55.156
And we all, we were failing so many students, and we were letting some students in that shouldn't be in.

06:55.196 --> 07:00.745
It must have been terrible to their egos that we all thought that admissions should be raised.

07:01.062 --> 07:10.455
Once you started teaching advanced courses, what about the quality of the students that survived and made it to those courses?

07:10.475 --> 07:11.055
Oh, much better.

07:11.075 --> 07:22.851
105, 106 were required, and gosh, you know, some of those students were just really, in fact, you could see the difference in 105, 106.

07:23.168 --> 07:36.481
106 students were better than 105 because if they had run the gantlet and gotten through 105, they were much better for 106 because 105 did a lot of weeding out and got rather very worse.

07:37.602 --> 07:45.049
In those early years, how much time did, among freshmen, did bonfire work consume?

07:46.771 --> 07:48.533
I don't think freshmen spent that much time on it.

07:48.733 --> 07:51.015
Certainly the upperclassmen spent a great deal of time.

07:51.434 --> 07:55.519
But I don't really know how much time freshmen spend looking back on it.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.823
And of course, in those days, we had lots of mixed people.

07:58.843 --> 08:00.725
We didn't have all freshmen in 105, 106.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.649
Engineering put it off even in those days.

08:03.709 --> 08:08.294
And so you had even your 105, 106, you had a lot of upperclassmen from the very beginning in there.

08:09.756 --> 08:14.482
So I'm not really sure how much time freshmen were using for 105.

08:14.782 --> 08:21.070
In that era, what majors on the campus were supposedly the toughest and the easiest?

08:22.889 --> 08:30.597
Well, I used to have, we used to talk about how bad some of the architectural students were and they were, some of those were pretty bad.

08:30.657 --> 08:41.989
I'm not sure I could make anything on, I had both good and bad engineering students, had some very good engineering students and some very bad engineering students.

08:43.011 --> 08:47.916
Meteorology and oceanography students I thought on the whole were pretty good if I remember correctly.

08:48.496 --> 08:51.900
They, I don't remember any bad ones sticking out so much.

08:52.522 --> 08:56.189
Was there a major that supposedly anybody could pass?

08:57.010 --> 09:14.243
Well, of course, in those days, everyone talked about—that's before we had the—well, that's before Parks and Recreation came in, and Parks and Recreation became—but in those days, people talked about majoring in sociology.

09:14.999 --> 09:18.605
And those courses were considered very easy.

09:19.306 --> 09:24.636
And also then in those days, most of your football players were going to be physical education majors.

09:25.197 --> 09:26.439
But that changed somewhat.

09:26.819 --> 09:29.564
And physical education tightened up to state requirements.

09:29.784 --> 09:32.449
All of a sudden they had to start taking chemistry and things like that then.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.813
And so then that's when the

09:36.751 --> 09:40.341
when the Parks and Recreation came in and wildlife was never one of them.

09:40.361 --> 09:41.966
People always think about wildlife was easy.

09:42.006 --> 09:44.613
Wildlife required biology and chemistry, things like that.

09:44.654 --> 09:46.238
It was never considered an easy one.

09:46.876 --> 09:57.073
As coeducation began, can you recall any classroom realities about women being in your classes?

09:57.494 --> 09:57.814
Yes.

09:58.015 --> 10:07.430
A number of times I had to speak rather sternly and very harshly to some students to make sure that they were not doing things they shouldn't be doing.

10:07.450 --> 10:12.158
But on the whole, really, there was very little overt.

10:13.505 --> 10:15.488
action towards the girls.

10:16.309 --> 10:20.875
I'm sure there were some otherwise, you know, but most of the time it was not.

10:21.455 --> 10:34.973
And once in a while you would have girls complaining, but the worst complaint I had one time was a young lady who came up to me almost in tears complaining about the guys in back and I was ready just to jump up and become furious and pound people to death.

10:35.138 --> 10:53.880
and she was upset because they were chewing tobacco in the back and they were spitting it and she had on white boots and someone had splashed her white boots with tobacco and she was very upset and I felt so relieved because I thought maybe we had some guys back there but we had a few instances where guys did things they should not be doing.

10:54.641 --> 10:55.782
Can you share some of those?

10:57.985 --> 11:03.171
Well you know using vulgar words and making remarks to girls and I had a

11:04.450 --> 11:06.274
And those were short skirts in those days.

11:06.294 --> 11:08.318
In a period, they were wearing very short skirts.

11:09.119 --> 11:12.346
And some young ladies, all they wore were short skirts.

11:12.426 --> 11:14.089
And that's when pantyhose came in.

11:14.731 --> 11:17.015
And some of them seemed to think that pantyhose covered everything.

11:17.757 --> 11:21.124
And so some of them just revealed a great deal.

11:21.284 --> 11:24.771
And guys were talking about that then as well.

11:26.810 --> 11:32.676
The Corps always tried to keep classes from getting, in any way, confrontation.

11:32.756 --> 11:36.220
And so, when, thank God, class, there was one thing nice about the Corps.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.862
The Corps kind of maintained control.

11:38.482 --> 11:46.751
I remember very clearly one of my colleagues' wife was in my class, and Marty Calvert, and we were very, very good friends.

11:47.572 --> 11:52.277
And she would needle me in class, and I would speak back to her.

11:52.848 --> 11:59.558
And one day she was leaving class and she looked up and there were three or four of these corps guys, some of them boots on.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.781
They said, Letty, what are you trying to do to us?

12:02.242 --> 12:02.683
She said, what?

12:02.703 --> 12:04.726
She said, you're trying to get this guy mad at us?

12:05.547 --> 12:08.111
Calm it, cool it, quit all that stuff on him.

12:08.512 --> 12:10.615
And she just died laughing, you know.

12:10.695 --> 12:14.320
And so the very next class time, we really went at it.

12:14.861 --> 12:17.505
And all of a sudden they finally realized that I knew her, you know.

12:18.093 --> 12:19.836
And so we all kind of died down.

12:19.856 --> 12:26.949
But they were very concerned that she was going to, they felt I would take action against all of the whole class because of her activities.

12:28.151 --> 12:38.489
And then in a few years, what could you conclude about the effects of the admission of women?

12:38.590 --> 12:39.932
What did that really mean?

12:41.397 --> 12:46.606
Well, there's an old saying, go, women civilized, and I think there's some truth in that.

12:47.007 --> 12:57.125
When I first came here, the Tessas used to come down and give the boys lectures on how to act on dates and how to be gentlemen and things like that, if you remember, from Denton.

12:57.966 --> 13:06.561
Well, TSCW, well, that was discontinued as we had our own girls, our own women, and I think the classes got...

13:07.621 --> 13:13.510
Well, for a long time there were remarks made and you always had a few guys in class who made remarks.

13:13.911 --> 13:17.957
But I think they became fewer and fewer as there were more and more girls in there.

13:18.478 --> 13:25.750
And you can certainly say that the girls being admitted probably took the place of a lot of guys who should have been there.

13:26.271 --> 13:32.160
And I think the quality of students improved a lot because the girls who wanted to come

13:32.883 --> 13:35.345
And that's not saying I didn't fail girls, because I certainly did.

13:35.365 --> 13:38.709
I didn't fail females, because I had bad female students.

13:39.349 --> 13:42.993
But I think we had, on the whole, better students probably.

13:43.053 --> 13:48.979
Did you have any incident you can recall relating to racial integration?

13:50.460 --> 13:50.680
No.

13:51.181 --> 13:51.942
Blacks came in.

13:51.982 --> 13:52.582
There were blacks.

13:52.702 --> 13:55.966
I did not that I can recall.

13:57.307 --> 13:58.328
Did you ever hear of any?

13:58.388 --> 13:58.989
I didn't.

13:59.009 --> 14:00.510
No, I never heard of anything in class.

14:00.963 --> 14:04.288
You hear about it from other people, but I never had it in class.

14:05.049 --> 14:13.661
And blacks came in, took their seats, and I became friends with some of them, and I did not know some of them, really.

14:13.802 --> 14:17.287
And several of the blacks I'm still friends with, I had in class a long time ago.

14:18.889 --> 14:23.055
So, you know, it's one of those things that probably things happen that you didn't know about.

14:23.710 --> 14:28.527
Black students, I had some good ones and I had some very bad ones, but that's true of whites as well.

14:28.748 --> 14:32.100
Did any black student ever come to you to

14:32.637 --> 14:35.221
share any problem they had encountered?

14:35.241 --> 14:39.148
No, I never had a black student come to me and talk about any problems they had in class.

14:39.628 --> 14:55.074
But on the other hand, by the time blacks were coming in class, I handed out my syllabus by that time, and my syllabus spelled out very clearly that I would not tolerate any type of that sort of thing, that you were all Aggies and acted ladies and gentlemen and so forth.

14:55.094 --> 14:59.421
So I made it pretty clear that I would not allow it, and that may have headed some of it off,

14:59.654 --> 15:03.820
Now, you heard stories from other people about things happen to them, but never in my classes.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.545
And nothing relating to Hispanics or Jews or international?

15:07.565 --> 15:13.473
No, well, of course, I think Hispanics had been accepted for a long time, and I didn't know who Jews were most of the time, you know.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.558
And did you have many international students in those?

15:18.359 --> 15:26.050
You had a few, but we went then, of course, we went to teaching international students separately, and I taught international students several times.

15:26.290 --> 15:27.632
Oh, describe.

15:28.132 --> 15:29.374
What was different about that?

15:29.573 --> 15:35.119
It was way different because 105, 106, we got where we were teaching them in separate classes.

15:35.639 --> 15:37.541
We discovered they simply were at a disadvantage.

15:39.604 --> 15:42.787
The classes were originally set up for a language barrier.

15:44.949 --> 15:47.272
One time I had a Jew in there from Israel.

15:47.312 --> 15:49.294
Well, he spoke better English than I did, you know.

15:49.314 --> 15:50.655
He had better syntax than I had.

15:50.976 --> 15:54.399
He didn't belong in there, but his background was such that he was taking the course.

15:56.421 --> 15:57.943
They were wild sometimes.

15:58.312 --> 16:05.741
because, and I'm not using any groups again, but some of those people, looking on some of those papers was not cheating.

16:06.162 --> 16:09.145
It was just simply the way you did things from their home.

16:10.367 --> 16:15.213
And you really had to keep your eyes peeled in those classes because you could have cheating wholesale.

16:15.253 --> 16:19.919
And the students in those classes varied from being very good to being very, very bad.

16:20.700 --> 16:23.323
And I found them not much different otherwise.

16:23.708 --> 16:24.950
You had those eagerly learning.

16:25.331 --> 16:27.054
And what we did is we simplified things.

16:27.174 --> 16:30.419
We cut out most minor figures.

16:30.459 --> 16:35.247
We were concerned they learned the President of the United States, the important people, and the important issues.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.134
And we didn't give them any minutia or any lesser people.

16:39.154 --> 16:42.780
We didn't care whether they knew the Secretaries of State or not unless they were a very important Secretary of State then.

16:45.511 --> 16:47.033
That's good.

16:47.553 --> 16:55.161
Were there, did any of those international students ever argue about their having to take this U.S.

16:55.181 --> 16:55.861
history?

16:55.901 --> 16:56.202
Oh, yes.

16:56.442 --> 16:57.503
They never thought it was fair.

16:58.504 --> 17:01.507
And I think now a lot of those international students take that in blend.

17:02.848 --> 17:07.693
We have fewer and fewer of them because most of them are taking it in blend, where they conceive it to be easier.

17:07.713 --> 17:09.254
Now, whether it is easier or not, I don't know.

17:10.015 --> 17:14.860
But they conceive it to be easier, and so most of them, we have fewer and fewer of those people taking it now.

17:15.700 --> 17:28.358
As far as the, you recall the reputation among the students, who were supposedly the toughest graders in the history department and who were supposedly the easiest?

17:29.680 --> 17:33.986
Well, I know I was considered to be tough grader.

17:34.667 --> 17:41.877
A number of people who were considered real tough in those days, like Stuart Coughlin, who was considered to be very, very tough left.

17:44.202 --> 17:45.564
I'm trying to think now.

17:45.584 --> 17:48.188
Lloyd Tedder was considered to be very tough, tough grader.

17:50.892 --> 17:52.794
I think you were considered to be kind of a tough grader.

17:54.677 --> 17:56.259
Herb was not considered to be a tough grader.

17:56.460 --> 17:58.803
Who was supposed to be easy, if any?

18:01.307 --> 18:01.988
Oh gosh.

18:09.639 --> 18:10.841
It's hard for me to remember now.

18:10.861 --> 18:13.905
I'm trying to think about that now.

18:16.602 --> 18:20.366
Many of those left, and so they're no longer there.

18:22.388 --> 18:25.612
I think Al Asker was considered to be kind of an easy grader, but I don't think that was necessarily the case.

18:26.072 --> 18:29.556
Al was a good teacher and he presented it to him, but he was considered to be kind of easy.

18:32.439 --> 18:37.665
I think Duncan was considered to be kind of, oh, and Nancy was considered to be a very hard grader.

18:38.386 --> 18:45.934
Duncan was considered to be kind of an easy grader, and I think Tom Miller, at times, people thought that he was not a hard grader.

18:47.888 --> 18:54.546
Then in political science, Jack Woods, no, he wasn't.

18:55.167 --> 18:55.990
He came a little later.

18:56.030 --> 18:57.012
He was not at the beginning.

18:57.032 --> 19:01.123
No, who was the guy that was, was it Jock Woods?

19:02.266 --> 19:04.412
Who was supposed to be easy with athletes?

19:05.793 --> 19:07.915
Oh, yeah, that was Wood, I think, yeah.

19:08.115 --> 19:08.976
He was a lawyer.

19:08.996 --> 19:09.697
He was an attorney.

19:09.717 --> 19:12.920
Yeah, that if you were an athlete, supposedly you could pass his court.

19:12.940 --> 19:14.741
You couldn't get an A, but supposedly you could pass.

19:15.682 --> 19:18.324
And Gene Benton was considered to be terribly hard, yeah.

19:18.905 --> 19:19.706
Blue Book Benton.

19:19.726 --> 19:20.486
Describe him.

19:22.648 --> 19:28.233
Benton loved to teach and was probably a much better researcher than he was a teacher.

19:28.654 --> 19:33.218
He would walk in the classroom and sit down, open up the textbook, and read from it.

19:34.160 --> 19:37.305
He actually read from, he didn't allow any questions in class.

19:38.807 --> 19:44.155
His exams came strictly from the textbook.

19:44.796 --> 19:49.002
And as far as I know, he added hardly anything at all ad-libbing other than what the textbook did.

19:49.142 --> 19:53.148
And he wrote, helped to write with the textbooks, and so frequently he was reading from his own textbooks.

19:53.488 --> 19:55.752
Why was he called Blue Book Benton?

19:55.772 --> 19:59.998
Oh, because he had those blue books, and they had to take those blue books, and they better fill them up.

20:00.282 --> 20:07.110
And as the old saying goes, it didn't really make much of what you said as long as you said a lot of it along the way.

20:07.490 --> 20:08.592
Benton was a very nice man.

20:09.913 --> 20:10.934
He was a good colleague.

20:11.034 --> 20:14.618
And highly regarded across the state.

20:14.638 --> 20:15.179
Yes.

20:15.199 --> 20:16.240
He was a good researcher.

20:16.260 --> 20:23.409
He'd written a number of books on a variety of topics, but he just simply, he never had any eye contact.

20:23.649 --> 20:24.670
He never looked at students.

20:25.510 --> 20:30.357
You could go in and talk to him in his office and evidently, if you went into his office, he was more relaxed.

20:30.418 --> 20:32.961
But in the classroom, he was very formal.

20:33.462 --> 20:35.125
He and Nance were much alike, I think.

20:36.006 --> 20:44.319
I think that he was, I think that Benton was more extreme than Nance was in that sense.

20:44.339 --> 20:47.704
But if you, one-on-one, Benton was really a nice guy.

20:48.916 --> 20:56.488
All right, then in the early 70s, Dr. Nance left the department headship.

20:56.788 --> 20:57.289
Yes.

20:57.309 --> 21:01.616
As far as you know, was that of his decision or not?

21:05.041 --> 21:08.146
I gather, I always kind of thought he was forced out, kind of.

21:08.247 --> 21:12.093
I always gathered that there was pressure on him to resign.

21:12.373 --> 21:16.780
He and Rudder were pretty good friends.

21:17.705 --> 21:27.328
And when Rudder died, and within our department, as you know, there was some considerable opposition to Dr. Nance in many ways.

21:28.029 --> 21:30.415
And I think that probably there was pressure on him.

21:31.694 --> 21:34.857
Then what was the process?

21:35.117 --> 21:36.439
I was not aware of it, by the way.

21:36.459 --> 21:39.081
I was not one of the inside groups, so I can't say that.

21:39.482 --> 21:47.690
What was the relationship with the, I mean, the process for the new department head selection?

21:49.492 --> 21:53.475
Well, when we came out, we said Nashville was going to step down.

21:53.596 --> 22:00.182
We had a full, there was a committee formed, and I don't remember who's on the committee now, and we had a full departmental.

22:00.955 --> 22:03.958
participation, which surprised a lot of people.

22:04.579 --> 22:14.710
We were still in Nagel when that whole process began, and we were going to move into academic there about that same time.

22:14.991 --> 22:16.512
And Dave Maxwell would have been dean by then.

22:16.532 --> 22:21.057
Maxwell was dean by that time, and it was a fairly open process.

22:22.279 --> 22:25.763
Someone like Herb Lang would remember more clearly probably.

22:26.403 --> 22:30.608
Now who was the selectee?

22:31.313 --> 22:32.295
Who was the new?

22:32.315 --> 22:34.739
Bryson Gooch.

22:34.759 --> 22:35.961
We interviewed several people.

22:36.442 --> 22:45.036
Actually, there was one, there was a fellow from, I don't remember his name now, from New York, one of the New York schools that I've kind of liked.

22:45.056 --> 22:50.385
But he, Gooch becomes a selectee, and I'm not sure really how that was.

22:50.990 --> 22:52.993
And he came highly recommended to the Corps.

22:53.013 --> 22:54.094
From Oklahoma?

22:54.114 --> 22:55.376
Oklahoma University, Oklahoma, yes.

22:55.717 --> 22:57.319
Describe him in his department.

22:57.339 --> 23:04.970
He was a well-known, Gooch was a well-known French historian and came highly recommended.

23:06.892 --> 23:08.695
And he'd done all kinds of work.

23:09.476 --> 23:12.621
And he came to A&M, and some people say he retired when he came to A&M.

23:13.302 --> 23:14.784
He was a department head.

23:14.844 --> 23:17.908
He was not nearly as...

23:20.318 --> 23:21.681
demanding as Nats had been.

23:21.721 --> 23:23.344
It was more relaxed when he came in.

23:23.704 --> 23:24.826
In fact, it was fairly relaxed.

23:25.828 --> 23:29.495
If you did things and didn't get in the way, then Gooch didn't bother you, really.

23:30.237 --> 23:30.437
All right.

23:30.497 --> 23:33.944
Now, did he operate as a chairman or as a department head?

23:33.964 --> 23:34.445
Robert head.

23:34.485 --> 23:35.446
He was a head.

23:36.068 --> 23:40.015
And I'm not sure who he consulted, if he consulted anyone hardly at all then.

23:40.552 --> 23:43.937
Now, under Dr. Nance, there were departmental meetings about how often?

23:45.240 --> 23:45.640
Meaning when?

23:45.660 --> 23:46.361
Not very often.

23:46.762 --> 23:47.523
Once a semester?

23:47.563 --> 23:50.889
I think once a, I think beginning of the semester, something like that then, you know.

23:50.909 --> 23:52.572
Kind of like we had our college meetings.

23:53.152 --> 23:55.737
And they were announcement meetings, weren't they?

23:55.757 --> 23:56.638
Right, mainly announcements.

23:56.798 --> 23:59.042
And what about with Gooch?

23:59.743 --> 24:01.185
There was a little more participation then.

24:02.087 --> 24:05.833
Gooch, there was questions and answers and things like that then.

24:07.383 --> 24:12.331
Gooch allowed arguments and discussions and things like that.

24:12.371 --> 24:13.172
Things were debated.

24:14.034 --> 24:14.975
So there was more.

24:15.576 --> 24:20.745
But on the other hand, if I can remember back to the last meetings with Dr. Nance, that was true too.

24:21.165 --> 24:29.599
So I'm not sure there was that much difference between Nance's last few meetings and Beer and Gooch's.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.846
Because Gooch sought advice

24:35.665 --> 24:36.807
and did as he pleased.

24:36.827 --> 24:37.929
And I think that's a safe state.

24:38.029 --> 24:50.291
In the 60s and 70s, was there anybody in the department who had some departmental responsibilities as advisor, counselor, in addition to Dr. Nance and Gooch?

24:51.473 --> 24:51.873
Hall.

24:52.735 --> 25:00.188
Hall part of that time was advising first graduate students, I think, and then later undergraduates, you know.

25:01.889 --> 25:13.446
And then when Keith Bryant came in, I guess Bayless was undergraduate advisor, then Bonnie Stadelman, then me.

25:14.347 --> 25:15.088
All right.

25:15.108 --> 25:18.172
Gooch was department chairman about, department head about how long?

25:18.192 --> 25:19.654
Seven or eight years, something like that then.

25:20.536 --> 25:29.128
And he got problems, of course, because of Shirley Gooch and marriage and things like that, you know, then.

25:29.632 --> 25:33.156
And did he... It wasn't even seven or eight years, more than four or five years, I guess.

25:33.176 --> 25:33.456
Is that right?

25:33.476 --> 25:37.901
Did he stay on here after ceasing his department head?

25:37.961 --> 25:38.202
Yes.

25:38.222 --> 25:48.573
When he became, when he ceased being department head, he was moved upstairs to Dean's office where he became director of research.

25:49.594 --> 25:55.441
That job had been held by, I forget his name now, another guy, Englishman, who was Englishman, and he became that.

25:55.821 --> 25:59.065
And he was director of research for two or three, four years.

26:00.867 --> 26:07.102
And then he came back down to the department as a faculty member.

26:08.666 --> 26:11.473
Now, by this time, the graduate program is beginning.

26:11.694 --> 26:12.576
Yes.

26:12.596 --> 26:15.062
Do you remember, can you describe how that

26:15.447 --> 26:16.949
got into higher gear?

26:18.110 --> 26:26.902
Well, I think in the early days a large part of our graduate students were people coming back to finish degrees in the summertime, giving a master's degree and PhD people.

26:26.922 --> 26:31.888
Many of our people already had jobs and were simply trying to complete finish things up.

26:32.469 --> 26:44.745
Herb Lang was the advisor in much of that then and was handling most of that and Herb pushed it I think very, very hard to improve it and get better people and things like that then.

26:45.316 --> 26:59.134
Do you remember any particular events relating to the department getting the authority to do a master's degree and then getting to do a PhD?

26:59.535 --> 27:00.035
Not really.

27:00.075 --> 27:10.429
I was a very junior member, and we were giving master's degrees, and I just remember when we submitted the proposal and began doing PhDs then.

27:11.911 --> 27:14.635
And I don't remember any particular... No, I don't either.

27:15.597 --> 27:17.179
...to-do about it.

27:17.340 --> 27:18.922
I think Nance did most of that, probably.

27:20.465 --> 27:22.368
And it went on a kind of a low-key?

27:22.448 --> 27:24.451
Very low-key for a long time, yeah.

27:24.471 --> 27:30.040
All right, then Dr. Gooch is followed by... Keith Bryant.

27:30.381 --> 27:33.085
And he came from Dayton?

27:34.007 --> 27:34.307
No.

27:36.886 --> 27:37.948
He was from Oklahoma.

27:38.548 --> 27:39.049
Where was he?

27:39.550 --> 27:40.972
I don't remember now where he came from.

27:41.012 --> 27:42.915
He came from North someplace, yeah.

27:42.935 --> 27:43.796
Maybe it was Dayton.

27:43.876 --> 27:49.304
He came from all the school because he came down here mainly because he hated shoving snow in his head.

27:49.344 --> 27:51.607
Describe him as the department head.

27:51.728 --> 28:03.805
Well, he was very... Gooch let things slide, and Gooch didn't really care what happened as long as he didn't bother him, and Gooch consulted what he did as he pleased.

28:05.810 --> 28:10.657
Keith was a department head for sure also but I think Keith consulted more.

28:11.298 --> 28:18.047
Keith talked to people like Henry Detloff and I think Herb and people like that.

28:18.067 --> 28:27.160
He talked to them more but he still had and the final decisions he made pretty much along that line you know.

28:28.085 --> 28:34.459
Did, were there any changes in the routine for a typical faculty member?

28:34.860 --> 28:36.524
No, we kept getting shorter.

28:36.664 --> 28:46.887
Fewer courses were cut from 4 to 3 and then from 3 to 2 to 3 and from 2 to 1 in many cases then.

28:51.743 --> 28:54.245
Well, there's more specialization certainly by this time.

28:54.766 --> 28:57.548
In the old days under Nance, he believed you ought to be able to teach anything.

28:58.149 --> 29:00.551
And that was to some extent true under Gooch too.

29:00.571 --> 29:05.115
But under Keith then, we're getting more specialized where you're teaching your specialized courses.

29:05.916 --> 29:11.721
And under Keith, the idea begins to come in that courses don't belong to anybody.

29:12.062 --> 29:17.607
If you took a course and developed it, it was largely thought that that was your course.

29:18.327 --> 29:21.210
For instance, you developed the Old South, that'd be your course.

29:21.663 --> 29:37.802
Herb Lang developed and but beginning under Keith then the idea begins to come in that that courses don't belong to anybody even though you develop the course anybody can teach it in that area and that really comes to real full-blown debates and arguments under Henry Detloff then.

29:38.542 --> 29:45.751
Well were there some incidents where someone thought that the course they expected to teach was going to be taught by someone else?

29:46.532 --> 29:47.653
Yeah for instance Herb

29:48.140 --> 30:07.757
I'm quite sure that one reason why Herb Lang decides to retire is because he got tired of hassling some of it, and you can speak to him, but there were people who thought they should be able to teach the old frontier, or Frontier America, which Herb had taught for years and developed, had a big following in it, and they wanted it.

30:08.218 --> 30:15.004
And so you get a lot of so-called young Turks who think they should be having to teach these cars, or they should be rotated.

30:15.984 --> 30:17.826
I never felt very strongly on that.

30:19.038 --> 30:23.505
Allen and Ashcraft, there are people who thought they should teach the Civil War and Reconstruction.

30:25.068 --> 30:29.335
Allen was not one of those who thought things should be rotated.

30:29.355 --> 30:34.323
He thought, I developed this course as my course and I should be able to keep it.

30:34.383 --> 30:36.867
If you want to teach a second one, okay, offer another course.

30:36.887 --> 30:37.548
It wasn't against that.

30:38.550 --> 30:39.932
If you can fill a course, okay.

30:41.482 --> 30:52.698
All right, so that would imply that people were not recruited because of a special specialization topic.

30:52.718 --> 30:57.905
I don't think, it wasn't until Keith, I think, that we began to recruit.

30:58.826 --> 31:06.477
If you remember, we used to recruit people to teach Western civilization, but they still had to be able to teach American history.

31:06.597 --> 31:08.940
One of the requirements was, can you teach

31:09.207 --> 31:10.750
American history.

31:11.211 --> 31:17.522
If you didn't have a field in American history, we frequently wouldn't even consider hiring you, even though you were being recruited to teach medieval history.

31:18.524 --> 31:21.670
All right, now the department moved from Nagel to where?

31:22.011 --> 31:22.872
To academic.

31:22.892 --> 31:23.233
Where?

31:23.618 --> 31:24.901
Describe those quarters.

31:24.921 --> 31:32.257
We were on the third floor, and our office was there, and then we had office on the fourth floor as well then.

31:32.397 --> 31:34.080
So, occupy the whole third?

31:34.902 --> 31:37.107
Yeah, most of the third, yeah, and part of the fourth.

31:37.588 --> 31:41.977
And back earlier, where had the classes been taught?

31:42.238 --> 31:44.142
Back in the Nagel days,

31:44.122 --> 31:45.764
Most often where were the classes?

31:46.225 --> 31:48.748
Nagel and chemistry and physics.

31:49.088 --> 31:50.510
Nagel and physics.

31:50.530 --> 31:52.032
Most of our classes were in Nagel Hall.

31:54.214 --> 31:56.357
Physics or academic.

31:56.377 --> 31:59.000
Very rarely did we go very far afield.

31:59.621 --> 31:59.821
All right.

31:59.841 --> 32:03.045
Then with the move to academic, where were the classes?

32:03.065 --> 32:04.187
Classes go everywhere then.

32:04.247 --> 32:05.568
We were much bigger.

32:06.209 --> 32:07.851
We're going down to
