WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:23.769
At the time, you see, I left right at the tactile end 
of all of that, but as I recall, I had simply made the

00:03.136 --> 00:23.769
assumption that when that was all over, the Board 
of Regents and the Board of Directors at the time

00:03.136 --> 00:23.769
were very supportive of it. I know that Pete 
Peterson had been active in the association, and

00:23.789 --> 00:30.780
he later was the name to the Board of Regents. and 
there was a kind of a carryover of leadership on the

00:31.452 --> 00:45.428
board that had been involved either through the 
association's work or some way where it did with

00:31.452 --> 00:45.428
the university. Sterling Evans by then is on the 
board. Do you remember any role that he played? I

00:50.774 --> 00:59.063
don't remember any role that Sterling played 
during the century study, I assume he was a member

00:59.819 --> 01:03.705
of the... I think he was. I'm sure he was one of them. 
But my memory of Sterling Evans was the fact that he

01:08.552 --> 01:22.713
was a student loan fund trustee of the 
associations for many years, and I worked with him

01:08.552 --> 01:22.713
for 17 years. And long about that time or before, We 
had three trustees. One was Sterling Evans, one

01:33.368 --> 01:47.028
was Jimmy Aston from Dallas, and one was a fella, 
Estelle, that was president of the big bank in Fort

01:33.368 --> 01:47.028
Worth. And we'd meet usually in Fort Worth and 
Dallas for dinner. And during those discussions,

01:51.735 --> 01:55.240
we would talk about student life. And that's when I 
recall more than any other time Sterling

01:56.553 --> 02:13.190
expressing his opinions to these other two men 
that something was going to have to be done at A&M

01:56.553 --> 02:13.190
and that was to let the girls come and to let them 
make that call. And he was one of them. Before John

02:15.233 --> 02:25.243
Lindsay, he was one of the other ones that back in 
the early days had the vision to realize that we

02:15.233 --> 02:25.243
needed to do something. Do you have any idea who it 
was put their arm around Earl Rudder's shoulder

02:25.915 --> 02:34.084
and kind of said, come on, Earl, let's go with it?

02:38.129 --> 02:42.594
My guess would be it was Harold Dunn. My guess it 
would be Harold Dunn, because Harold was the

02:42.614 --> 02:47.920
chairman of the century staff. And he was very 
involved with it. And he knew psychology. And he

02:56.206 --> 03:06.818
knew that Earl was scared to death and was not 
willing to really back him. And I don't know, but

03:08.239 --> 03:14.086
I'm guessing it would have been well done. Now, I 
may sound to be a little critical of Earl, but I want

03:14.106 --> 03:24.998
to be truthful about the way it all came out. And 
I'll say this without fear of blind addiction. I

03:31.368 --> 03:34.653
don't think a single person in the world could have 
pulled this off. Except? Except our old brother.

03:38.017 --> 03:42.082
Now I say he drugged his feet, which I think he did. I 
don't think he won, which I don't think he did. I

03:45.346 --> 03:50.192
don't think he won the name check, but he probably 
did. And I don't think that we could have had

03:50.212 --> 03:54.698
another version at the time. that could have 
rolled with the punches, stayed in there, worked

03:55.927 --> 04:05.775
with the legislature, and got this thing done. Now 
Earl had a lot of help, but he was a driving force in

04:05.796 --> 04:20.128
bringing people like you

04:05.796 --> 04:20.128
and a lot of people you know to this campus. Well, 
let me put into this. a little connection. As the

04:28.113 --> 04:40.344
Secretary of the Aspirations Report, it was my job 
to write the draft of the report, particularly on

04:28.113 --> 04:40.344
RISL, Resident Instruction Student Life. The 
other part on research and extension was easy, do

04:41.706 --> 04:46.410
more better. So it was my job then to write up the 
part arguing for, justifying, non-compulsory

04:46.450 --> 04:54.317
core racial integration, women, higher 
admission requirements, and so forth. I turned it

04:58.992 --> 05:03.057
in to Wayne Hall, the Vice President of Academic 
Affairs. He called me back three or four days

05:03.518 --> 05:11.168
later, gave me the copy that Mr. Rutter had read and 
annotated. He told me to revise it, bring it in line

05:11.909 --> 05:17.656
with Mr. Rutter's comments, a number of which were 
negative. Who prepared that? The original, or I

05:21.685 --> 05:23.247
did. You prepared it and sent it to Rutter and he 
made some notes on it. And where'd you get this?

05:32.956 --> 05:33.957
This is a bunch of crap. No way. I go back to Vice 
President Hall a few days later and said, I can't in

05:36.379 --> 05:44.848
good faith make those changes because the 
committee. That's not the report. That's right.

05:46.930 --> 05:47.170
That. Our opinions are subjective. We may be in 
error, but we do believe that A&M has got to make

05:50.494 --> 05:56.022
these changes. And I always am proud to say, to 
recall that he said, I'll stake my job on your right

05:56.042 --> 06:04.955
to speak what the committee really believes. And 
so I turned it back, didn't hear any more. I then

06:08.521 --> 06:14.570
forgot to turn back in the copy with Mr. Rutter's 
comments. About two months later, one Sunday

06:14.590 --> 06:16.853
morning, Got a call from Dorsey McCrory. We were on 
our way to Sunday school in the garage. Where was

06:22.413 --> 06:24.015
that copy? In my office in Nagel Hall. I'll get it to 
you in a few days. He said, I'll meet you at Nagel

06:27.900 --> 06:30.584
Hall in 10 minutes. And I'm guessing that somebody 
had told him, get that report. Earl. Yeah, that's

06:36.392 --> 06:37.173
my guess. Earl told him to get it. So I gave it back to 
him. I don't know whether it still exists or not. I

06:44.677 --> 06:51.385
never had any call from anybody to try to pressure 
me or anything else. And I don't know that any

06:51.485 --> 06:53.868
member of the committee did. But we all admitted 
that we were surprised when we voted unanimously

06:54.589 --> 07:04.041
for all these changes that each of us thought he 
might be a minority of one or two. And we were

07:06.203 --> 07:09.147
pleasantly surprised that it went on. Are you 
aware of whether or not the board of directors,

07:13.583 --> 07:20.271
then called board directors, did they have any 
long debates over this or do you know? I do not know.

07:23.014 --> 07:23.835
I do not know. I don't even have a copy of that 
report.

07:29.881 --> 07:31.964
I got it when I left the association. I just didn't 
think about taking a copy of that report. I

07:36.929 --> 07:42.696
remember when it was done and I just thought it was a 
beautiful piece of work. Didn't Bob Hunt prepare

07:43.604 --> 07:47.128
one first and it was thrown out the window? I think 
so. I think that Bob Hunt prepared one, but not

07:48.349 --> 07:53.234
acceptable. And I remember talking to Darcy and 
talking to Wayne Hall to some extent. And they

07:59.180 --> 08:03.224
said, well, we're going to redo it. And I think I 
knew at that time that they'd moved it over to you to

08:03.424 --> 08:08.650
prepare. But I don't remember. I think that 
everybody was so relieved and so pleased with the

08:14.131 --> 08:28.051
report and the decisions that came out that we all 
just assumed that it was going to be approved by

08:14.131 --> 08:28.051
everybody. Now, how much debate did the board 
have? I doubt that they had very much. We never

08:33.319 --> 08:39.548
heard of any rumors or hints that there was any 
division when the board did I don't recall any

08:40.034 --> 08:44.399
division on the part of the board. I think the board 
was very informed and knew all about this century

08:44.979 --> 08:53.388
study that was being conducted. And they knew what 
was happening.

08:57.773 --> 09:01.917
And I think that they were prepared for it all when 
it came out. I remember the name change was one of

09:02.598 --> 09:09.265
the biggest things that happened in the whole 
thing. By that time we realized that we were going

09:09.970 --> 09:14.817
to have integration. I'm sure we had some blacks 
already by that time. I can line it up. Did you hear,

09:23.009 --> 09:27.295
I never heard any opposition to integration, did 
you? No, no. I never heard a rumble over that. I

09:29.378 --> 09:30.380
didn't hear a thing. The only thing I heard was the 
late women, the optional, and the name check. even

09:39.738 --> 09:56.982
though Bill Moore, in a moment of

09:39.738 --> 09:56.982
not much attendance, got a Senate resolution 
passed making the Corps optional. And nobody

09:58.364 --> 10:02.210
hardly knew about what was happening. And this 
caused quite an uproar. This was before the

10:03.832 --> 10:05.715
century started. Now, Moore was for the changes, 
wasn't he? Yes, very much so. Moore was for

10:09.927 --> 10:12.309
optional coal. Moore was for co-education. He was 
for the name change. He was for integration. I

10:20.677 --> 10:24.961
don't think he was on the century study, because he 
was a state senator. But he was for the . Now,

10:27.964 --> 10:30.486
Brownrigg Dewey was our representative. And as 
far as I know, he was quietly low key for. Low key

10:34.771 --> 10:35.451
for. Brownrigg never talked much about it. But 
Bill Moore was. Boy, he was strong. And you know

10:40.992 --> 10:43.435
Bill and Earl were like this. And they tried not to 
fire me. But Bill Moore had talked to Earl, and I

10:50.582 --> 11:00.892
didn't know it, about making the former student's 
office move off the campus. And I didn't know it.

11:01.873 --> 11:02.514
Because? Because they claimed that I talked very 
impugned. into running against Biltmore. I

11:09.910 --> 11:11.351
didn't know all this was going on. We had an 
executive board meeting, and we had the meeting,

11:11.391 --> 11:21.640
right at the end of the meeting, President, 
somebody said, by the way, we've got this problem

11:11.391 --> 11:21.640
we need to talk about. And I said, what's the 
problem? And they said, Biltmore is old enough to

11:23.762 --> 11:30.188
be unhappy with you. And Pew was running against 
change, wasn't he? Wasn't he opposed to the

11:34.732 --> 11:36.313
changes? Well, probably. Marion Pugh? Probably. 
Okay. But this situation had nothing to do with the

11:39.940 --> 11:44.605
Century Senate. Oh, okay. He was running for the 
Senate. Bill Moore had announced he was running

11:48.428 --> 11:55.655
for the State Senate against Bill Moore. Somebody 
had told Bill Moore that me personally had talked

11:56.856 --> 12:03.803
Marion Pugh into it. Therefore, he was mad at me and 
he was mad at the association. We had this meeting.

12:11.882 --> 12:17.230
I said, I did not have one thing in the world to do 
with it. The first time I knew that Pew was running

12:17.250 --> 12:24.140
against Bill Moore was when I saw Pew's picture of 
the eagle. And I just told him honestly. I said, I'm

12:27.826 --> 12:30.229
telling you, I didn't know a thing about it. Wayne 
Durham from Abilene was on our board. He was a good

12:35.003 --> 12:39.748
friend of Bill Moore last night. And I forgot who 
was president of the association there, but they

12:39.768 --> 12:44.833
said, well you go to Austin and talk to Bill Moore. 
Tell Bill Moore that the association and Herbie

12:46.034 --> 12:56.064
had nothing to do with Pew electing to run against 
you, which I didn't. And he went and talked to Bill

12:56.084 --> 12:58.006
Moore. Bill Moore just forgot about it. And later 
on, Bill Moore and I got to be close friends, still

13:02.035 --> 13:06.583
are. And I think I'm partly responsible for 
getting Earl and Bill Moore together, and they

13:06.603 --> 13:15.739
did. Now, I heard third-hand reports that by sheer 
coincidence, during some of those months of

13:15.759 --> 13:26.237
debate, two automobiles would drive with their 
lights off into the parking lot behind the campus

13:27.297 --> 13:55.498
theater at about 10 o'clock at night and these two 
total strangers would roll down their driver's

13:27.297 --> 13:55.498
side window and would chat with this total 
stranger in the other vehicle and that a close

13:27.297 --> 13:55.498
observer if he had walked by might have realized 
that this was the state senator and the A&M

13:27.297 --> 13:55.498
president who just accidentally happened to be 
there chatting with each other but they They then

13:55.850 --> 14:05.464
could also say, whomever those strangers were, 
that they had never really talked about this with

13:55.850 --> 14:05.464
the other one. Deep throat? Yeah. During your time 
with the association, did the association ever

14:06.606 --> 14:18.022
engage in any activity in Austin for anything?

14:19.985 --> 14:21.908
Well, yes.

14:24.892 --> 14:27.034
Did you all lobby for better appropriations? We 
lobbied mainly, we lobbied for better

14:27.215 --> 14:36.986
appropriations as far as we could under our 
charter. We wouldn't do anything to question our

14:37.286 --> 14:40.650
tax status. And you can't try to enforce 
legislation and maintain the type of tax status we

14:42.072 --> 14:48.699
had. So we were very careful about that. But we did 
lobby. Whenever our permanent university fund

14:55.047 --> 15:20.109
was questioned, and we had more or less committees 
among our 180 A&M clubs, those that were located in

14:55.047 --> 15:20.109
Texas, to be prepared upon the receipt of the 
telephone to go back. And I mean first team back. We

15:24.612 --> 15:31.621
had some of the top stud horses in every town. 
Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Parks

15:31.641 --> 15:38.249
Christian, Abilene, El Paso, Texarkana, Tyler. 
We had the state, every senatorial district, 31 in

15:38.269 --> 15:45.017
Texas. And we had committees, standing 
committees lined up. Ready to go. Ready to go. And

15:53.997 --> 15:56.660
every once in a while we had to use them. And we put 
them into effect. And here go the phone calls and

15:58.522 --> 16:03.907
the letters to the people from those districts. 
And we did mostly

16:04.888 --> 16:13.657
work on the university fund to protect it. There 
were always people trying to invade the

16:13.677 --> 16:21.045
university fund. Another thing too, we were 
active in getting legislation passed that

16:21.700 --> 16:35.379
provided for funding for these other schools 
outside the

16:21.700 --> 16:35.379
University of Texas system. Now let's see, the 
governors that you worked with would have been...

16:35.399 --> 16:42.529
Well, John Connolly. Connolly. Then before him, 
Shivers. Shivers and Smith. And Buford Jester? To

16:51.875 --> 16:53.817
some extent, early. That was before Alan Shivers. 
That was in right after the war, 46, 47, 48. Buford

17:01.706 --> 17:04.509
Jester and then Shivers. And then who after 
Shivers? Was it Conley or was it Smith? I believe

17:10.535 --> 17:11.596
it's Conley. Conley, yeah. And during Conley's 
administration is when Maggie Lee had such an

17:13.258 --> 17:17.863
influence in traveling all over the state about, 
well, when Earl came here, Earl sat down in the car,

17:18.299 --> 17:28.430
I remember you talked about deep throat. Earl and I 
would travel around in the car a lot, and he showed

17:28.450 --> 17:37.960
me one day, he said, you know what the average 
salary of a professor at A&M is? This would have

17:39.022 --> 17:43.767
been in 57 or 58 or 59. 58, probably. 48. No, 58. He 
came here in 57. $9,400. The average salary

17:53.821 --> 18:00.731
of a professor. And I said, that's got to be 
increased. We came that way. And that's when we got

18:06.720 --> 18:12.409
Maggie to provide his airplane.

18:14.412 --> 18:16.555
We got Tom Harrington early. I had a pair of guns 
held. We got Logan Wilson from the University of

18:22.270 --> 18:27.378
Texas.

18:27.398 --> 18:42.420
We put in some money to provide to, we hired this 
guy,

18:27.398 --> 18:42.420
he was a bearded man from Austin, a lot as you may 
know. You may remember him. And he was more or less a

18:42.880 --> 18:45.144
staff director. He'd been a lobbyist and he helped 
us. to improve, well first, we did a selling job to

18:48.665 --> 18:59.561
the people of Texas, the big people of Texas, on the 
importance of our education in Texas. The fact

19:00.923 --> 19:07.252
that we were losing the top of our herd, our best 
faculty people, to out of state institutions.

19:08.253 --> 19:17.727
They were going, leaving here by the droves, not 
going to stay in Texas, going up there where they

19:08.253 --> 19:17.727
appreciated us. I think you were on some of these 
trips, weren't

19:18.432 --> 19:23.542
you? We'd get the top people in Houston, like 
Beaumont, or Houston, or Dallas, or Fort Worth,

19:23.562 --> 19:31.417
Abilene. We'd get the top people up there, mostly 
Haitians, Dallas, to pay for the dinner. That was

19:37.147 --> 19:39.291
the first thing we did. We got a sponsor. Once we got 
the sponsor, then we invited the top people, like

19:41.956 --> 19:47.765
Dallas. We had the mayors of all these, and we had 
state senators, and we had members of the

19:47.785 --> 20:05.533
legislature from those areas come, and Tom 
Harrington and Logan Wilson were the main

19:47.785 --> 20:05.533
speakers. Every once in a while Earl would do some 
talking, and Ransom, Ransom was his name? Harry

20:11.684 --> 20:12.325
Ransom. Harry Ransom from Austin would do the 
talking. But we tried to keep Logan Wilson and Tom,

20:15.469 --> 20:22.418
because Tom could make a good speech. Oh yeah. And 
that's about the same time that Connery came up

20:22.759 --> 20:28.507
with this sales tax. And I don't know whether he 
dedicated the sales tax to education,

20:38.352 --> 21:05.338
He used education as a reason for selling the 
people of the state of Texas on the sales tax and so

20:38.352 --> 21:05.338
that whole effort was very important and I think 
more than anything else, even though we did

20:38.352 --> 21:05.338
include the other state schools, it really 
focused to the people of Texas the importance of

21:05.774 --> 21:12.664
the University of Texas system and the A&M system 
to the state. And we didn't exclude North Texas

21:12.684 --> 21:19.293
State, we didn't exclude the East Texas, 
Southwest, and all the rest of them. We included

21:19.874 --> 21:27.124
them, but we were the forces.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.167
Let's go back to the Deans. We had an interruption 
and we were getting ready to talk about Frank

21:30.688 --> 21:35.152
Hubert. Frank Hubert. Frank was my number one 
contact, I think, except for maybe Earl and Darcy

21:36.733 --> 21:43.319
and Wayne. I didn't deal too much with

21:43.439 --> 21:48.864
Wayne. But Frank had been brought in here by Earl. 
Do you know what the connection was there? Did they

21:58.002 --> 22:00.805
know each other in Austin? Because Hubert was J.W. 
Edgar's right-hand man at the Department of

22:04.689 --> 22:09.535
Education for a while in Austin. In Austin. And I 
was wondering if they knew each other then. I'm

22:15.802 --> 22:18.905
going back and trying to recollect.

22:23.330 --> 22:26.153
Earl needed help, and he needed some. for good 
health when he first came back here. And I remember

22:31.064 --> 22:41.073
some of those first people that he drew were Frank 
Hubert. And I'm assuming, see Frank had been

22:41.093 --> 22:46.879
superintendent of schools at Orange. That's 
right. Was my high school principal. All right,

22:49.381 --> 22:51.883
your high school principal. And he went with Mr. 
J.W. Edgar in Austin. and that was a key role in

22:55.563 --> 23:19.596
state at the time and I'm thinking that when Earl 
was at Austin, when he was in politics more or less

22:55.563 --> 23:19.596
with a land commuter job and getting elected job 
and supporting Lyndon Johnson that he and Frank

22:55.563 --> 23:19.596
were involved and He brought John Calhoun into 
here from wherever John was, wherever John was.

23:25.023 --> 23:25.283
Penn State. Penn State. He brought John into Penn 
State. And he brought,

23:28.847 --> 23:39.501
let me think a minute, this man that later went to 
Oklahoma State, Bob Com. Com. He brought Bob Com in

23:40.562 --> 23:46.049
the same time he brought John Calhoun in. Who else 
along that time? He brought... Frank Hubert. Now

23:51.587 --> 23:53.769
where did you find Dorsey McCrory? I got the 
Dorsey. I was Dorsey's room hardy. Oh. And

24:00.435 --> 24:08.783
Darcy under the Thomason Act went into the 
service. Earl talked to me he said I wanted an

24:08.803 --> 24:20.093
assistant and I want a retired, I want a reserve 
officer and I want somebody that's got an A&M

24:08.803 --> 24:20.093
degree.

24:23.482 --> 24:27.888
And I wanted to be my sister. You gotta be somebody 
to be recognized by the enemy. But my first

24:31.713 --> 24:35.439
recommendation was Dave Hitch. You remember Dave 
Hitch? I went to Earl and I said, Dave Hitch,

24:36.600 --> 24:42.308
he's your man. And Earl called Dave Hitch. Dave 
Hitch didn't want, he didn't want to leave Davis

24:43.970 --> 24:51.040
Field. So Earl called me and said, we struck out on 
For your first suggestion, I said, all right, I got

24:53.924 --> 24:59.152
another one. I had talked to Darcy at a class 
reunion or two. He wanted to get out of the

25:04.741 --> 25:06.463
military. He was a full colonel in the Army. And I 
had known that he had gone to Yale and gotten a

25:09.127 --> 25:15.337
master's degree in Yale, but he was a reserve 
officer. And he wanted a position with the

25:16.358 --> 25:20.725
university. I guess it later proved off that I more 
or less made a mistake. Anyway, I went to Earl and I

25:26.862 --> 25:35.833
said, your man is a little colonel named McCrory. 
And he said, well, can you get him down and talk to

25:36.033 --> 25:43.783
me? And I said, yeah. I called him and gave him 
Earl's telephone number. And I said, if he wants to

25:46.727 --> 25:51.032
talk to me, you got to make arrangements to get him 
in. He talked to Earl and the Army didn't want to let

25:51.907 --> 26:02.702
him go because he just finished

25:51.907 --> 26:02.702
this Naval War College or Army War College. 
Anyway, Earl said, if you want to come and if you

26:02.722 --> 26:07.628
will come, if you will accept the money, I'll pay 
you. I'll get you separated from the Army. And I got

26:11.794 --> 26:14.778
him a house he moved into when we first came. I did 
all that stuff. Yeah, I got Darcy here. And Ed

26:21.337 --> 26:25.181
Cooper, did he go to work for Mr. Rudder while you 
were still? Yeah, I was involved in that too. Earl

26:28.724 --> 26:41.797
was working in the, not Earl, but Ed Cooper was 
working in the extension service. I think so. He

26:43.018 --> 26:47.462
finished A&M in 53 and

26:50.058 --> 27:00.609
I had people call me wanting to employ somebody to 
run that

26:50.058 --> 27:00.609
maritime thing in Galveston. And I called them and 
I said, Ed Cooper's your man. I said, Ed Cooper?

27:07.616 --> 27:14.563
Well, Ed went down and interviewed these people 
and for some reason they couldn't quite get

27:07.616 --> 27:14.563
together, but they were gonna pay him. salary two 
or three times what he was making a year. Anyway, I

27:19.218 --> 27:24.625
had gotten acquainted with Ed and become fond of 
Ed. And

27:26.627 --> 27:44.770
then when

27:26.627 --> 27:44.770
Ed, by reason of Ed left the university, went to 
work with Broach in the oil business for a while.

27:50.416 --> 27:58.264
He had been,

27:50.416 --> 27:58.264
I'm not sure he'd been in Earl's office before then 
or not. I guess I'm kind of doubting. Anyway, Buck

28:00.527 --> 28:14.622
was running the association

28:00.527 --> 28:14.622
and Ed Cooper had left the college trying to make a 
fortune in the oil and gas business and that didn't

28:00.527 --> 28:14.622
work out. And

28:15.125 --> 28:38.836
they found a position for him over there, and then I 
guess when Dorsey, sometime in there, during

28:15.125 --> 28:38.836
Earl's time, not during Jack Williams' time, 
during Earl's administration,

28:15.125 --> 28:38.836
I guess maybe Dorsey brought him in there, and 
Dorsey went over to the development office.

28:39.197 --> 28:44.524
Dorsey went to the development office in 61, 
about.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.525
This young man, John Lindsay. John Lindsay. When 
did he become active in the former student? He was

28:52.109 --> 28:56.173
active in the former students when I came back here 
in 1947. So he already... He was already active in

28:57.634 --> 29:01.778
the former students program. Very active. He was 
on the councils and he was on the committees and he

29:03.539 --> 29:09.384
was involved in Houston. Anytime you needed 
anything in Houston, you'd count on John Lindsay

29:10.305 --> 29:14.629
to step forward with it. He was, we would have the 
A&M meetings around and he would be present, not in

29:15.503 --> 29:28.757
the big open meetings, but in the smaller full 
session type meetings when he was most effective.

29:30.499 --> 29:35.844
That's when he would shake his fingers and just let 
the girls come to the A&M. Can't keep them out

29:35.864 --> 29:38.607
anymore. We had past presidents meetings around 
every year. mostly a social event, but all the

29:42.655 --> 30:07.735
old-class presidents would come back and we'd 
have a meeting somewhere at a resort or somewhere,

29:42.655 --> 30:07.735
and I recall at those meetings, John would, and 
Earl would be president, a lot of them, and John

29:42.655 --> 30:07.735
would say, fellas, we can't operate like we 
operated in 1972. This is 1955, or this is 19, we've

30:08.457 --> 30:15.006
got an 18 girls' committee. And John was talking 
it, but nobody else would even mention girls. But

30:19.913 --> 30:22.937
John was saying, we've got to move this forward. I 
remember a meeting we had down at Key Allegro in

30:23.518 --> 30:30.888
Rockport. Mr. Krueger's son, Carl Krueger, 
developed that whole thing. And he had us down

30:35.778 --> 30:45.669
there one time, he said he asked me, John, made a 
speech to the people and we started picking up on

30:35.778 --> 30:45.669
them. Harold Dunn started realizing, Jimmy Astin 
started realizing, Bobby Krueger, Mr. Tyree

30:45.689 --> 31:04.469
Bell, and some of those real leaders started 
saying, well, we've got to do something. We've got

31:04.489 --> 31:05.109
to do something. That was in the days when most of 
the old

31:06.136 --> 31:12.368
die-in-the-wool Aggies like Charlie Babcock. I 
wouldn't think of a girl ever coming to him. I know

31:17.318 --> 31:18.921
Mr. Babcock's opposition. Who were the other most 
vocal, active opponents? Well, T.L. Smith, Jr.

31:23.129 --> 31:26.997
used to be Mr. Charlie Babcock for the most vocal.
