00:06.747 --> 00:18.765
Well, I think the time I first started thinking 
about oceanography was before there was any

00:06.747 --> 00:18.765
really formal training, you might say, or 
curriculum or degrees in oceanography. It wasn't

00:19.994 --> 00:37.361
until, oh, what, the last 20 years, something like 
that, that there is a formal training curriculum

00:19.994 --> 00:37.361
in oceanography, degree-granting, graduate 
degree-granting, and, of course, outfits like

00:19.994 --> 00:37.361
Scripps was one of the first ones. As a matter of 
fact, right now, today, of the 10 leading, or 12,

00:37.381 --> 00:46.035
depends on how you want to argue it, leading 
oceanographic institutions in the country,

00:46.943 --> 00:54.059
There's only one director who actually has a 
formal degree in oceanography, and that's Johnny

00:46.943 --> 00:54.059
Knauss up in Rhode Island. All the other directors 
have come through it by not necessarily a

00:55.963 --> 01:04.362
circuitous route, from the outside, so to speak, 
because I mentioned the lack of formal training in

01:04.747 --> 01:20.371
oceanography, to mouth anything until about 20 
years ago, in one of the disciplines that comprise

01:04.747 --> 01:20.371
the sub-disciplines of oceanography. 
Oceanography isn't a separate discipline like

01:20.391 --> 01:28.543
geology or chemistry or biology, but it's the use 
of all those to solve problems in the environment

01:20.391 --> 01:28.543
of the ocean. And that's one reason why we don't 
have an undergraduate degree in oceanography.

01:33.134 --> 01:41.041
And again, the leading oceanographic 
institution with one exception, the University

01:33.134 --> 01:41.041
of Washington, doesn't have an undergraduate 
degree. Because you have to be first grounded in

01:41.061 --> 01:52.012
some basic science and certain peripheral 
subjects along with it before you can really begin

01:41.061 --> 01:52.012
to do a job professionally in oceanography. So in 
my case, I came through the geologist geophysical

01:52.032 --> 01:59.239
route. For example, Paul Fein out with Hall as a 
chemist, Nirenberg, Scripps as a physicist. And

02:07.866 --> 02:16.519
right on down the line, Bradtray out at Washington 
is a, let's see, he's a chemist. And John Byrne at

02:17.581 --> 02:22.729
Oregon State is a geologist. George Bullard, who 
wrote a hat to Hawaii, is also a geophysicist. So

02:29.419 --> 02:34.385
this is the way the situation basically exists. 
And so in answer to your question, which may seem to

02:34.485 --> 02:47.923
be a long way around the mulberry bush, is that I 
came to oceanography through the virtue of

02:34.485 --> 02:47.923
geology and geophysics because Once having 
applied this information on land, obviously, in

02:48.376 --> 03:07.878
order to solve some of the problems, you had to turn 
to the sea, particularly in such major areas as

02:48.376 --> 03:07.878
crustal evolution, drifting continents, and 
whatnot, and the origin of continents and ocean

02:48.376 --> 03:07.878
basins. But the geologists on land can't solve 
these problems because the answers are skewed by

03:07.898 --> 03:17.168
thousands and, in some cases, tens of thousands of 
feet of sediment. And if it weren't for the

03:17.587 --> 03:30.005
information of the geological and geophysical 
ocean arcs that had gotten at sea, we never would

03:17.587 --> 03:30.005
have had the information we have now toward 
solving the earlier problems I mentioned. Well,

03:30.025 --> 03:32.369
when did these problems first occur to you? Do you 
remember? Was it when you were working at

03:33.350 --> 03:36.795
Standard, or was it prior to that? No, these 
problems occurred to me actually when I was

03:37.276 --> 03:45.568
working for my graduate degree at Princeton, 
because my major professor there, Dr. Harry Hess,

03:46.730 --> 03:59.787
had already started going to sea to start solving 
some of these problems using Vainik Mayonnaise's

03:46.730 --> 03:59.787
pendulums and a submarine and paddling around the 
Caribbean and whatnot. And George Willard, who

03:59.927 --> 04:11.722
had just graduated from Princeton when I first 
came, and Maurice Ewing were making studies off

03:59.927 --> 04:11.722
the New Jersey coast in the water. Did you 
participate in these? No, I didn't participate.

04:15.006 --> 04:15.066
No. before I came doing this work. And just by the 
time I came, he left and went up to withhold. And so

04:26.851 --> 04:29.899
when the war came along, with all the practical 
problems that were thrown in the laps of the

04:30.284 --> 04:35.791
oceanographers at Woods Hole to solve. I was soon 
asked to join the staff, so I did most of my war work

04:35.811 --> 04:51.092
at Woods Hole in the oceanographic factors 
affecting sound ranging in the sea, the Navy

04:35.811 --> 04:51.092
problems, anti-submarine, pro-submarine 
warfare. So that's how I wound up at Woods Hole.

04:55.647 --> 05:00.073
Now, you were an instructor at Princeton from 38 to 
42. This overlaps with private business, it

05:00.153 --> 05:03.737
seemed to me. You were also listed at Standard Oil 
at the same time. Is that correct? Well, I was a

05:07.562 --> 05:09.885
consultant at Standard Oil at that time. What 
happened was I worked for Standard Oil in New

05:09.925 --> 05:15.012
Jersey and New York before I went to Princeton. And 
then I decided to go on and get my PhD. And so they

05:17.975 --> 05:24.844
supported me with consulting work part of the 
time, although I was on a fellowship at Princeton.

05:25.128 --> 05:29.893
So I can see where the question arises. 42, you go to 
the Navy. Right. And then most of your work you do

05:33.156 --> 05:37.301
for the Navy is done at Woods Hole. Yeah. Although I 
did start out doing some work for the Navy in Rhode

05:37.901 --> 05:51.135
Island in connection with the gousing ships, 
which is also geophysics, protecting the ships

05:37.901 --> 05:51.135
from magnetic mines that were planted in the 
water. by wrapping coils of copper around the ship

05:52.381 --> 06:03.260
and putting current through it to set up a field 
equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to

05:52.381 --> 06:03.260
that of the ship's field. So when the ship went over 
a magnetic mine, the mine, there was no magnetic

06:03.741 --> 06:11.655
field force in the ship trigger and set off the 
mine, or the triggering mechanism. And that

06:17.634 --> 06:23.552
problem was solved pretty rapidly, and it went 
from there to Woods Hole on the submarine work.

06:24.713 --> 06:28.301
Does that explain, then, your interest in 
magnetism? Yeah. Did you come to that as a

06:30.225 --> 06:33.732
petroleum engineer, or was this... Geophysical. 
Geophysical. Okay. And then you were asked to

06:36.598 --> 06:42.872
apply that then in the Navy, a specific problem you 
were assigned to solve in the Navy. Okay. So you

06:45.790 --> 06:48.094
were involved in the anti-submarine work? Yeah, 
at Woods Hole and in the, you might say,

06:48.655 --> 06:57.609
geomagnetism the first couple years at Rhode 
Island. Did you meet Spilhaus involving the

06:58.871 --> 07:02.076
anti-submarine work? No, I didn't meet Spilhaus 
until, oh golly, about 1948 or 49. Spillhouse had

07:09.280 --> 07:13.644
left Woods Hole at the time when I came in. It was 
about 41, I think. When you leave the Navy in 45 and

07:17.708 --> 07:23.853
then return to Woods Hole?

07:23.913 --> 07:30.779
No, chronologically, as I recall, I left the Navy 
in 42 and went to Woods Hole in 42 to 45. And then at

07:31.580 --> 07:38.106
the end of 45, I went back to work for Standard & 
Jersey and won the subsidiaries, in this case

07:31.580 --> 07:38.106
Humboldt. What sort of work was going on at Woods 
Hole between 1942 and 1945? Was it primarily work

07:44.154 --> 07:46.880
involving the war effort? Yeah, not only in 
connection with anti-submarine, pro-submarine

07:46.900 --> 07:55.740
warfare, but

07:46.900 --> 07:55.740
for underwater photography, looking for wrecks 
and sunken enemy submarines to get a better idea of

07:56.176 --> 08:03.187
what they looked like. And then depth charges, 
more chemistry and more efficient ways of using

08:04.129 --> 08:11.721
depth charges. There was a whole gamut of things. 
More passive things is developing anti-fouling

08:15.532 --> 08:24.389
paints so that the ships wouldn't have to be 
painted as often and could go through the water

08:15.532 --> 08:24.389
fast. Oh, just a jillion things. But they were, as 
you say, all directed toward pragmatic war

08:25.471 --> 08:31.482
problems that needed to be solved. Actually, 
before the war, Woods Hole did not operate all year

08:31.782 --> 08:34.928
round. They just had funds to operate in the 
summertime. And it wasn't until the war came along

08:39.456 --> 08:48.252
that they got funding from the Navy and the Army and 
the Air Force and whatnot that they operated on

08:39.456 --> 08:48.252
12-month days. Did Woods Hole always have some 
sort of a contact with the Ivy League? We're struck

08:52.066 --> 09:00.503
more often than not how many people are brought in 
from the geophysics and from various places to

08:52.066 --> 09:00.503
work at Woods Hole as senior researchers, so to 
speak. Of course, there again, the geographical

09:00.524 --> 09:05.113
position tend toward that direction. And they 
were close to, say, the Ivy League. And Harvard had

09:08.345 --> 09:16.013
a good representation, even in the days of 
summertime, of climate only. And

09:16.033 --> 09:20.417
Columbus-Island was in Harvard on the faculty. In 
fact, most of the people that were on the Harvard

09:20.457 --> 09:29.987
faculty, a lot of this spread out into Princeton 
and some of the other, the bulk of it was One of the

09:30.997 --> 09:39.247
first directors, Bigelow, was a Harvard man, and 
then Islin was the second. Actually, Woods Hole

09:39.267 --> 09:48.077
didn't become a degree-granting institution 
until about, well, more than the last ten years.

09:49.159 --> 09:52.302
Did you sell any oceanographic vessels out of 
Woods Hole? I read an article of yours where you

09:52.322 --> 09:54.625
suggested or you describe the importance of these 
vessels. Do you have any comments you'd like to

09:57.485 --> 10:00.029
make on these? The Thompson?

10:04.296 --> 10:05.397
I'm sailed on the Thompson. No, no, not sailed on 
them. I said that you made comments about how you

10:06.599 --> 10:11.787
thought these were innovations in oceanographic 
research.

10:15.007 --> 10:17.711
This is a two-way street. I'm minding something. 
The Thompson is a relatively new agar-type vessel

10:20.134 --> 10:26.383
that's been floating around now for about 89 
years.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.590
And it isn't particularly innovative. Well, what 
would be its exact job? You say that these vessels

10:33.292 --> 10:43.987
are probably now designed to do specialized work 
in oceanography rather than general work, I

10:33.292 --> 10:43.987
suppose, in comparison with the Challenger and 
the type of mission. Yeah, no. The Thompson is

10:45.652 --> 10:49.137
doing pretty much the same as the Challenger. It 
belongs to the Navy, but it's on bailment to

10:49.217 --> 10:53.202
Scripps. It's one of an Agor class, the Thompson 
and Scripps, and we've got a similar one up in the

10:54.183 --> 11:02.194
University of Washington. That's not the 
Washington itself, is it? No, it's the other way

11:05.518 --> 11:06.480
around. It's very confusing. Two Agors, the names 
of them. One is named, you'd think it's

11:09.524 --> 11:15.051
Washington, but it belongs to Scripps, and the 
Thompson belongs to... University

11:15.554 --> 11:20.584
of Washington. But anyway, those are minor 
points. I don't remember saying anything about

11:23.048 --> 11:28.498
the Thompson or the Washington or the Agos in 
general. I did write an article once in connection

11:28.579 --> 11:37.275
with the new type of vessels that the Navy has now, 
the Gyre and the Moana Wave out of Hawaii, which

11:37.863 --> 11:48.340
were an outgrowth of a special type of vessel that 
we designed when I was a TI to do work at sea in the

11:37.863 --> 11:48.340
Navy. I think that's what it is. This one over here 
is one of the parts in this class that we designed at

11:52.386 --> 12:02.402
Texas Instruments and used for contract work with 
the Navy and with the oil companies and whatnot.

12:05.244 --> 12:16.300
That's what I'm trying to lead into, actually, is 
while at TI, which is jumping ahead of our story,

12:05.244 --> 12:16.300
what sort of innovations did you work in in 
oceanography at TI? Well, for one thing, the

12:17.441 --> 12:27.195
design of a vessel that gave more flexibility to a 
particular type of mission as a function of its

12:17.441 --> 12:27.195
length. In other words, what we have now in the 
gyre, we have a series of vans of different that are

12:32.909 --> 12:41.661
designed for particular sub-disciplines of 
oceanography, like chemical oceanography, and

12:32.909 --> 12:41.661
theological, and physical, and so on. And so by 
having a lot of after-deck on a ship available to

12:42.382 --> 12:58.022
put these specialized vans on, you can get more 
laboratory space for a particular mission of some

12:42.382 --> 12:58.022
certain type than you could if you tried to have the 
same lab space for the four disciplines on one

12:42.382 --> 12:58.022
ship. It would be like the French then. I think 
that's one of the things we worked on, along with

13:02.575 --> 13:07.419
Captain Rowe, when I was a TI. Hank Rowe, who was a 
retired captain of the Navy, worked with me very

13:07.439 --> 13:12.103
closely. In fact, when I came here and the Navy 
decided to build the type of vessel we have now, the

13:12.123 --> 13:26.456
Jarrah type, that he continued his work with them 
and with ourselves as a consultant on it. So Hank

13:26.476 --> 13:31.941
Rowe is the one who really worked out the details 
and made it gritty with this new type of vessel.

13:32.596 --> 13:34.781
Would you explain exactly how it would work? I take 
it you put compartments on for... Yeah, the ship

13:34.941 --> 13:45.222
has basic laboratory space that's used by all the 
disciplines, like electronics lab. for

13:45.573 --> 13:48.716
electronic information and navigation and so on. 
Then a wet lab. But then, from there on out, it's

13:51.059 --> 13:56.524
just a steel deck, except for winches and things 
like that. And if a cruise, the emphasis is

13:56.945 --> 14:08.737
supposed to be on chemical oceanography, well, 
then the van-type labs that you put on board are all

13:56.945 --> 14:08.737
outfitted, especially for chemistry, if it's 
biology, for biology. And that way, you can get

14:08.757 --> 14:14.162
more for your money, so to speak, on this 
particular type of... mission than if you just had

14:14.142 --> 14:19.671
a ship that had cubby holes for this branch and that 
branch. Of course, it doesn't have to be

14:21.594 --> 14:24.759
restricted entirely to one sub-discipline. You 
have two sub-disciplines. What was your role in

14:28.005 --> 14:30.348
this design? Was it more as a researcher who would 
know what kinds of things you would need, giving

14:30.368 --> 14:36.218
ideas as to what compartments you might want and 
leaving it up to them to design how it was going to

14:37.312 --> 14:41.617
be? Exactly, yeah. I mean, I make no pretense of 
being a naval architect or anything. The ship

14:45.862 --> 14:54.432
design and whatnot was left to that type of person, 
but I think you put it pretty well as to what my role

14:45.862 --> 14:54.432
was in it. The advantages of this type of 
flexibility. So from experience, you were

14:58.036 --> 15:04.063
telling them what you needed and then let them work 
out the detail of how it was put together. Right.

15:05.543 --> 15:19.119
For example, I never thought of increasing the 
freeboard 18 inches by putting gratings over the

15:05.543 --> 15:19.119
main deck, putting a false deck over it, which 
achieved the advantage of giving you more

15:05.543 --> 15:19.119
freeboard. And yet at the same time, you could also 
run cables and piping connections without

15:19.579 --> 15:24.685
tripping over them. I mean, things like that Roe 
thought of, I think. What's a freeboard? That's

15:29.651 --> 15:32.935
the distance from the deck to the water line. And 
that's another advantage of this type of ship as

15:32.915 --> 15:37.628
compared, say, to the Russian ships. They have 
such a high free port. It's more luxurious in the

15:39.473 --> 15:44.005
standpoint of having more room for recreation and 
whatnot. It doesn't roll as much. You can be away

15:45.738 --> 15:47.540
from port longer. But they take things that look 
like a cruise ship on their oceanographic

15:47.580 --> 15:54.688
vessels. And so you're standing 40 or 50 feet or 
more above the water trying to handle equipment

15:54.708 --> 16:02.096
and instruments and whatnot. On the other hand, if 
you've been in the sea on a gyre, you'll have the

16:02.116 --> 16:09.604
same complaint that other people have, which is 
you get your feet wet all the time. There's no happy

16:09.624 --> 16:11.967
medium between the two. Well, that's something 
that Spilhaus, I believe, said was important for

16:12.858 --> 16:16.402
an oceanographer. Yeah. To do at least several 
times. I wonder whether he meant it literally or

16:18.545 --> 16:22.850
briefly. Did you spend much time on these 
oceanographic vessels while you were at TI or

16:23.150 --> 16:27.155
before? Yeah, in order to only test out these ideas 
that we had, but more or less in a supervisory

16:27.976 --> 16:36.666
capacity.

16:36.766 --> 16:38.608
What vessels did you sail on in particular? Well, 
the Atlantic seal and the Arctic seal. the ones I

16:42.440 --> 16:46.305
spent most of the time on. Is there any description 
you'd like to make of the cruises? Not really. I

16:50.390 --> 17:06.050
mean, they're a regular routine type of 
oceanographic cruises whose mission varied from

16:50.390 --> 17:06.050
gathering geological and geophysical 
sub-bottom information to, in the case of some of

16:50.390 --> 17:06.050
the Navy work, was classified. Can't talk about 
that too much, although some of the Navy work

17:06.070 --> 17:10.135
wasn't classified. to gain information about the 
sea and beneath the sea. Again, to solve specific

17:19.293 --> 17:20.895
problems. Ed, we have you at a geophysicist at 
Humble Oil between 45 and 48. And what we'd like to

17:28.586 --> 17:33.272
know are two things involving that. First of all, 
were you involved in development of seaward

17:33.332 --> 17:37.978
planning for ESSO?

17:41.148 --> 17:43.211
Yeah, in two ways. One, in connection with the 
amount of area offshore that might lend itself to

17:43.471 --> 17:53.987
potential oil problems. And then some of the 
problems that you would get into in connection

17:54.007 --> 18:04.202
with getting oil from and producing oil from once 
you found the oil and dealing with problems. But

18:05.077 --> 18:09.524
there again, it is a question of bouncing back and 
forth. I started out in geology and geophysics at

18:09.664 --> 18:24.746
Princeton, and then I applied those principles to 
acoustics to solving problems with Woods Hole in

18:09.664 --> 18:24.746
connection with the war, and then, of course, the 
first part in connection with magnetic mines. And

18:25.427 --> 18:27.270
then oceanography. Frankly, there was no market 
for oceanographers, per se, at that time. So I fell

18:32.336 --> 18:40.846
back on my original training in geology and 
geophysics and went back to work for Humble, first

18:32.336 --> 18:40.846
as a research geophysicist. And then when they 
started getting interested in going to the Gulf

18:41.647 --> 18:55.603
area and getting their feet wet, as Spilly would 
say, they looked around for someone who knew

18:41.647 --> 18:55.603
something about oceanography, and Humble being a 
pretty big company, didn't realize they had the

18:56.022 --> 19:01.769
closest thing in oceanography at that time 
already within their group. And so they went to

19:01.789 --> 19:07.977
Woods Hole to try to hire somebody, and Woods Hole 
told them, well, they had a pretty good

19:01.789 --> 19:07.977
oceanographer right on their staff. So then he 
came to me and asked me to set up an oceanographic

19:07.997 --> 19:15.107
section, which is that next period there. Which is 
1945, 49 to 54. Yeah. Right. Well, we noticed that

19:17.370 --> 19:23.678
in 1949 and 1950, you presented both your first 
paper and began to publish. Does that explain...

19:25.351 --> 19:28.735
Your upward mobility, or is it in terms of 
Humboldt? Yeah. I think the first thing I did for

19:29.636 --> 19:42.553
Humboldt, I mean, one of the first things I did for 
Humboldt that was published was that

19:29.636 --> 19:42.553
bibliography of marine geology and geophysics. I 
went back to Woods Hole for a summer and spent the

19:42.573 --> 19:49.161
whole summer in the library putting it together. 
And then we also figured out from management to say

19:49.181 --> 19:52.405
that what the problems were going offshore in the 
provinces, potential provinces, and where the

19:54.258 --> 20:00.571
potential provinces were. And then to take the 
geophysical instruments that have been

20:01.052 --> 20:14.359
developed for land work, like the gravimeter and 
magnetometer, and adapt them to making

20:01.052 --> 20:14.359
observations at sea under continuous activity, I 
mean, in continuous motion. and not only a

20:15.200 --> 20:25.841
standard gravity meter and magnetics, but also 
electrical methods for looking for salt domes. I

20:25.921 --> 20:33.276
guess I happen to have pictures here of the early 
Humboldt fleet. a boat converted to making

20:33.256 --> 20:50.374
surveys using an electromagnetic field of the 
Earth to find the salt dome because of the big

20:33.256 --> 20:50.374
difference in electromagnetic characteristics 
between the salt dome and the surrounding

20:33.256 --> 20:50.374
sediments. So it's just a question of applying 
basic principles of geology and geophysics to

20:54.755 --> 21:03.887
marine modifications who are necessary in order 
to operate in a marine environment. These are some

21:03.907 --> 21:09.374
of the early Humboldt ships, as you probably 
recognize them. They're straight subchases that

21:09.394 --> 21:15.582
were used during the Navy for

21:16.321 --> 21:17.884
anti-submarine warfare work. And then there was 
surplus when the war was over. And those were the

21:19.727 --> 21:24.876
first things that the oil companies and the 
service companies latched on to buy. And here's

21:24.896 --> 21:26.018
one you can see. Gravity meter on the thing. Great 
big old bulky thing that was put over the side of the

21:29.184 --> 21:32.710
ship. and lower down to the bottom to make a 
reading. When I first came with Humble, they

21:37.561 --> 21:46.902
actually had a diving bell that they put this poor 
guy in with a gravity meter and then clamped the top

21:37.561 --> 21:46.902
on and lowered him over the side of the ship. Well, 
it wasn't a ship, in this case, a subchaser. And of

21:49.921 --> 21:58.631
course, if the sea were running at all, any sort of 
waves, well, he was very reluctant to go down and

21:49.921 --> 21:58.631
make a gravity measurement. And I noticed there 
was never any argument between the supervisor and

21:58.691 --> 22:09.143
the guy, because the instrument man would 
probably say, well, if you think it's so hot, well,

21:58.691 --> 22:09.143
you go down yourself. This is a very crude way of 
first starting out, taking an actual meter that

22:09.123 --> 22:20.060
was designed for making observations on land, 
putting it in the lap of a guy and putting him in a tin

22:09.123 --> 22:20.060
can, putting it on down, putting him on the bottom. 
Then the next step was the one that you see on here,

22:20.381 --> 22:25.809
where they designed a gravity meter that could be 
read remotely on the bottom. And finally, today,

22:26.330 --> 22:35.164
the evolutionary history of it is where you have 
gravity meters that are put on ships, and instead

22:26.330 --> 22:35.164
of making observations point to point the way the 
man and the bell would be, or the that type of

22:35.448 --> 22:37.613
gravity meter on that ship there. We can get a 
readout on the ship chart as we go along. Was Humble

22:43.005 --> 22:48.296
one of the first companies to start heading for the 
sea and doing this research? Yeah, Humble and

22:48.597 --> 22:51.483
Mobile were probably the first. Actually, Mobile 
was the first one. If the truth were known, and at

22:55.276 --> 23:02.808
this point it's no longer classified, none of the 
companies want to go to sea because they didn't

22:55.276 --> 23:02.808
have any experience in it and whatnot. But once one 
company went to sea, well, the

23:02.828 --> 23:10.760
self-preservation, all the others had to do too 
for fear that this one company would get to jump on

23:02.828 --> 23:10.760
all the goodies out there. So one group after 
another went to sea. But Humble was the first

23:13.965 --> 23:19.834
company to have actually designated an 
oceanographer and an oceanographic section.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.077
Shell was the second one. And then a lot of the 
others just contracted their work out to

23:23.288 --> 23:30.217
consulting companies that needed oceanographic 
work. Well, once the exploration phase and

23:30.237 --> 23:40.831
transition was made, it turned out that Humboldt 
felt that probably I could do more good in the

23:30.237 --> 23:40.831
production, producing activities. And in other 
words, what sort of wave forces would act upon

23:42.313 --> 23:53.228
these offshore platforms that they were going to 
stick in the water to drill off and produce from, if

23:42.313 --> 23:53.228
they hadn't had any experience before. and 
problems of following organisms on the platform.

23:56.746 --> 23:59.130
So it was a whole new area. And that's when I first 
got involved with Professor Reed. I was chairman

24:03.996 --> 24:16.414
of an API committee, American Petroleum 
Institute Committee, on getting together from

24:03.996 --> 24:16.414
the oil companies their design criteria for 
offshore platforms with regard to wave forces on

24:03.996 --> 24:16.414
them and whatnot. He participated in that 
symposium that we had at that time. Now, when was

24:21.813 --> 24:22.554
this? That was about the middle 50s. About the 
middle 50s, while you were still director of the

24:24.396 --> 24:27.361
oceanography section? Yeah. One of the things 
that really slowed it up was the Truman

24:29.023 --> 24:38.237
proclamation and the leasing restrictions that 
he put on. The company didn't know whether their

24:38.277 --> 24:45.608
leases would be valid or not, so they held off for a 
while. oceanography, you might say commercial

24:46.297 --> 24:51.684
oceanography in the oil company, so it leveled off 
for a while. And so that's why I left in 54 to go with

24:52.025 --> 25:08.187
Geophysical Service, Inc., which is the 
originator of Texas Instruments, because they

24:52.025 --> 25:08.187
offered me a job in heading up their new gravity and 
magnetic divisions, and that's I could see myself

25:09.061 --> 25:12.126
at the time when I left the Humboldt. It was just 
being plateauing for a while. This looked like a

25:15.491 --> 25:17.775
new opportunity to me, a lot of fun. So I went back to 
that field, although, again, I was still doing

25:17.895 --> 25:27.230
work for GSI at sea, the way I had been doing for 
Humboldt, only this time, again, the exploration

25:17.895 --> 25:27.230
side. People, not people, but a number, several 
people have said I'm a charlatan or a genius, one or

25:28.592 --> 25:35.102
the other. And I protest rigorously on neither. 
This precipitated by the time, again, I was with TI

25:38.338 --> 25:54.171
in the early 60s when I had a contract with NASA to 
figure out what geological and geophysical

25:38.338 --> 25:54.171
experiments should be made when the astronauts 
arrived on the moon. And the first guy that called

25:54.809 --> 26:00.536
me, Charlton, was one of the competitors that also 
had a proposal and didn't get the contract. And he

26:01.217 --> 26:03.160
said, what do you mean? He said, you start out as a 
land geologist and geophysicist, and then you

26:03.240 --> 26:10.129
turn into an oceanographer and go to sea. And now 
you're telling people what should be done on the

26:10.529 --> 26:15.636
moon in geology and geophysics. And I said, well, 
it's simple, because the fundamentals of geology

26:15.616 --> 26:25.471
and geophysics are the same, whether you happen to 
be on planet Earth or on planet water or on planet

26:15.616 --> 26:25.471
moon. Simple as that. And it was interesting to see 
that. See, that was in around the early 60s, when

26:30.498 --> 26:45.100
the astronauts did land on the moon,

26:30.498 --> 26:45.100
that they followed out pretty well the things that 
Jacqueline Lopek and myself had outlined, with

26:45.333 --> 26:51.943
the help, of course, of about 25 consultants, what 
should be done. We also looked for water on the

26:52.544 --> 26:56.290
moon, too. This group that I was involved in and 
running at the time. That's even more solemn than

27:01.939 --> 27:05.444
we all know. There's very little water on the moon. 
A lot of people had ideas that perhaps there'd be

27:06.586 --> 27:09.771
some sort of a... Oh, hydrate just below the 
meteoric dust. All right, this explains, then,

27:16.752 --> 27:20.243
your interest in space in the mid-1960s. Yeah.
