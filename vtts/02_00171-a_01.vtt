WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:26.207
my 42nd wedding anniversary happy anniversary 
thank you it's a slightly cloudy day outside

00:02.984 --> 00:26.207
sitting in the living room clint phillips house at 
1704 glade and now we're going to stop and be sure

00:02.984 --> 00:26.207
that it's working

00:02.984 --> 00:26.207
clint before you came here um give us a brief 
biographical summary of you where you grew up and

00:27.031 --> 00:53.123
went to school and your academic experience 
before you came to a m okay i was

00:27.031 --> 00:53.123
drafted into the army in world war ii and almost 
immediately became i was in the what was called the

00:27.031 --> 00:53.123
asdp program but when i got into Fort Hayes, Ohio, 
where I was literally admitted into the Army. I was

01:00.659 --> 01:02.784
asked if I wanted to be an aviation cadet. I said 
yes. I was sent to Jefferson Barracks for

01:03.605 --> 01:13.508
pre-training and then on to Marietta College, 
where I got the equivalent of almost a year's

01:03.605 --> 01:13.508
college in five months. And then went on and did the 
rest of the service bit. Came back and went to

01:20.174 --> 01:25.323
Baldwin Wallace College in Berea, Ohio. Managed 
to get through school working part time. and

01:31.645 --> 01:43.962
started in the summer of 46, finished in the fall of 
48, August of 48, and was at Vanderbilt working on a

01:31.645 --> 01:43.962
master's September of 48. Came back a year later 
and taught two years at Baldwin Wallace, then went

01:45.364 --> 01:53.755
back to Vanderbilt to work on my doctorate which I 
got, finished the dissertation after I had taken a

01:54.950 --> 02:06.249
job, two years after I had taken a job in 1954 at the 
University of Tennessee. So in 56 I got the Ph.D.

02:07.692 --> 02:11.899
Now this is all in finance? This is in economics. I 
got the degree in economics. I was in the economics

02:16.166 --> 02:19.472
department at Tennessee.

02:22.237 --> 02:32.346
Two years after I got the degree, I started out as an 
instructor, became an assistant professor the

02:22.237 --> 02:32.346
next year, an associate the third, which is kind of 
phenomenal. Then I stayed an associate for a

02:32.366 --> 02:33.967
while. But in 58, I moved to Tulane University in 
New Orleans, where I remained until 1967. While

02:45.998 --> 02:52.243
there, I twice served as an acting dean of a 
business school.

02:53.641 --> 02:59.049
as associate dean most of the time that I was there 
when I was an acting dean. Came here in 67 as a full

03:00.451 --> 03:04.717
professor. By then I was a full professor at 
Tulane.

03:10.525 --> 03:12.568
Found it to be quite a startling difference. Do you 
want me to go into that? Let me break in at this

03:15.012 --> 03:16.274
point. How did you and A&M become linked up? What 
was the process? I had chaired a seminar for

03:23.459 --> 03:30.491
visiting faculty members at Tulane. Tulane was in 
the forefront of introducing the computer to the

03:30.531 --> 03:43.273
business

03:30.531 --> 03:43.273
college environment In fact, I was one of the first 
to use a business game for decision-making

03:44.283 --> 04:05.802
purposes on an old IBM 1650, which took 55 minutes 
to process a decision, which would go in a snap of a

03:44.283 --> 04:05.802
finger now. I had this program and George Rice from 
the management department came from A&M as a

04:05.782 --> 04:15.031
participant. He went back and later I got a letter 
from here from George saying could I recommend

04:15.731 --> 04:32.987
some people that were graduates of our program and 
I mentioned some and I also said I might be

04:15.731 --> 04:32.987
interested. because I was getting kind of tired of 
the school situation in New Orleans, which you may

04:34.402 --> 04:42.014
know is particularly difficult at that time. We 
had our child and both children in private schools

04:43.115 --> 04:48.364
because the public schools are so bad.

04:51.208 --> 05:02.265
So anyway, to make a long story short, I came here in 
67 as a professor of management. management. And

05:04.121 --> 05:07.565
let's see, I'm not going to ask any other dollars in 
this. What was the beginning salary? Sixteen

05:09.306 --> 05:10.307
fifty. Sixteen thousand five hundred. For nine 
months. For nine months. And you... And one of the

05:13.430 --> 05:29.406
reasons I was interested in this place is that the 
AAUP bulletin had listed the five or three or

05:13.430 --> 05:29.406
whatever top schools in terms of percentage 
increases in salary. And I thought that was

05:29.426 --> 05:30.767
interesting. So I came here making more than I'd 
been making as a teen at Tulane, which wasn't a lot

05:31.625 --> 05:38.255
of money. I mean, the year before, I think Tom 
Saving had come at around 40 or 45K,

05:38.335 --> 05:46.286
but he was well known. At that point, 
organizationally, business was a school or was it

05:46.527 --> 05:53.737
yet a college? It was still a school, and the dean 
was... Hubert? Hubert. Yeah. So it was a school

06:01.950 --> 06:08.757
within the

06:01.950 --> 06:08.757
College of Arts and Sciences. That's correct. 
John Pearson was the director. Who were the key

06:13.482 --> 06:20.390
business faculty and administrator leaders at 
that time?

06:23.393 --> 06:27.838
Well, I suppose George Rice would have been one of 
them in management. John Pearson was serving as a

06:28.679 --> 06:35.307
business analysis acting head, even though he was 
a director. Marketing, oh, I've forgotten his

06:36.549 --> 06:41.415
name, but he's still here.

06:44.439 --> 06:48.544
Accounting was a fellow named Jack Coleman. He 
left shortly after and became a dean somewhere in

06:50.346 --> 06:57.876
California.

06:58.058 --> 06:58.559
Anyway. What was the reputation of A&M in general 
business? Just getting off the ground, really. It

07:06.293 --> 07:07.476
wasn't a college. It was not accredited by the 
American Association of Collegiate Schools of

07:08.778 --> 07:13.848
Business. But I saw this place as a you know, a place 
whose time had come. And, you know, in hindsight, I

07:22.339 --> 07:25.283
was right. But so were a lot of people at that time. I 
don't take any special... What was, for you and

07:27.626 --> 07:34.294
your family, what was your impression of the 
community when you arrived? Well, of course, we

07:34.314 --> 07:41.944
came from New Orleans, where we had our own waiter 
at Antoine's, and the same one the business school

07:34.314 --> 07:41.944
used all the time. And so this was a terrible shock. 
For Judy, it was fortunate there was a fledgling

07:45.983 --> 07:54.590
League of Women Voters group developing, and she 
got involved in that. She'd been in the League

07:54.971 --> 07:58.373
since the days we were in Knoxville. She'd been a 
secretary of the State League in Louisiana. So she

08:02.497 --> 08:04.779
was really into that. That helped. And the kids 
were happy in the school here. How did you find the

08:08.842 --> 08:11.484
quality of the schools, local? Quite good. They 
went to South Knoll over here. So that was good, but

08:16.291 --> 08:24.469
otherwise, you know, when you're used to dining 
out, it was the Texan, and that was that. One of the

08:24.890 --> 08:34.452
things that kind of wowed me was I was taken over to 
see the president when I was being interviewed,

08:24.890 --> 08:34.452
and so... Earl Rutter and I talked for about thirty 
minutes about the Jolly Green Giant of New Orleans

08:34.718 --> 09:01.890
the Attorney General there who was involved in the 
Kennedy assassination business Jim Garrison was

08:34.718 --> 09:01.890
his name he was called there the Jolly Green Giant 
so did Rutter know him or anything no he didn't know

08:34.718 --> 09:01.890
him but he was really up on politics of course And it 
had happened, the assassination of course in

09:02.242 --> 09:10.863
Dallas, and I suppose he knew a whole lot about 
that. What was your impression of Rutter based on

09:11.484 --> 09:17.078
that conversation?

09:18.188 --> 09:23.740
really, I was not really impressed. I thought gee 
whiz, this guy is president of a major university

09:23.760 --> 09:33.721
and the kind of people I'd known as presidents 
before were more academic. I subsequently became

09:34.523 --> 09:38.070
extraordinarily impressed by what he did and I 
said so publicly in fact got a nice comment from

09:38.050 --> 09:46.742
Mrs. Rudder Margaret about Oh you're meaning 
after his passing? No even while I was still here

09:51.308 --> 10:06.268
and got to know really what a role he had played in 
turning this place in the right direction and of

09:51.308 --> 10:06.268
course with Jack Williams coming on after him it 
was a perfect combination What about the quality

10:06.957 --> 10:09.923
of the students when you first arrived? Did they 
make any impression? I thought the students were

10:11.768 --> 10:14.774
reasonably good. I was not impressed with the 
graduate students. But they have since, of

10:19.529 --> 10:22.895
course, become... I remember I had two cases of 
plagiarism in a master's course. It just amazed me

10:28.224 --> 10:45.013
that they had... One guy had gone all the way 
through undergraduate school and had never

10:28.224 --> 10:45.013
written a paper, which really distressed me.

10:46.360 --> 10:51.310
kind of, it was still a Bush League school in my 
judgment. People who had doctorates flouted it. I

10:55.960 --> 11:05.319
found that Bush League at Tulane, we went to great 
pains to put Mr. So and So on the door. Although

11:07.370 --> 11:09.414
students might call you Doctor. Everybody was 
Mister. Everybody was Mister. It was, there was an

11:12.800 --> 11:22.797
enormous, Chicago, University of Chicago had an 
enormous influence on Tulane, in part because so

11:12.800 --> 11:22.797
many Chicago PhDs were there. Anyway, there was a 
lot that really bothered me about this place. I

11:27.743 --> 11:47.629
fell in with a group that met over in that round 
circle, rotunda kind of thing in the YMCA

11:27.743 --> 11:47.629
building, a lunch bunch, met every Friday or every 
once a month, I don't know, and we gave little

11:27.743 --> 11:47.629
papers, and it was sort of a hatchery. Did we call 
that the Brown Baggers? Yeah, it was called the

11:49.451 --> 11:51.754
Brown Baggers, that's what it was. I wish there was 
such as that now. I'd love to be part of one again.

11:56.658 --> 11:56.798
Yeah. Because that was fun. I thought it was fun. 
Now, all right, did you have, in those first years,

11:59.322 --> 12:04.951
did you have much interaction with John Pearson? 
Yeah, a good bit, and as a matter of fact, within

12:06.153 --> 12:13.725
two years, the end of the second year, about to 
enter the third year. I'm walking across the

12:16.506 --> 12:22.073
campus with him, and he says, I've got a terrible 
problem. I hired a guy to be head of the finance

12:22.153 --> 12:29.882
department, and he called me this noon and said he 
can't come. He didn't know that he didn't have a

12:30.482 --> 12:32.625
Ph.D. Guy was getting it at Northwestern. He 
looked good on paper, but in any event, didn't

12:36.710 --> 12:39.713
come. He said, will you serve? His words were, I'm 
not asking you, I'm telling you, I want you to be the

12:42.459 --> 12:49.710
acting head of finance. So that was how I came to be 
head of the finance department. I wasn't even in

12:53.356 --> 12:54.558
the department. That

12:55.900 --> 13:02.390
would be 69, fall of 69. Rutter's last full year. 
That's right. I was in the academic council at the

13:06.001 --> 13:12.451
time and sat in those meetings over which he 
presided. Describe those meetings. Do you

13:16.618 --> 13:18.681
remember any important topics you all discussed? 
I'm

13:19.582 --> 13:24.610
trying to remember one. It had to do with faculty 
responsibility.

13:35.110 --> 14:02.821
I'm vague about it but it had to do with putting more 
regulations on faculty to make sure they were

13:35.110 --> 14:02.821
coming to the office on time and things like that 
and Rutter kind of said we expect people to do what

13:35.110 --> 14:02.821
they're supposed to be doing but it was kind of an 
interesting session. I remember Another, this

14:04.625 --> 14:20.285
probably happened after Rutter had died, but 
there was a furor or at least a little flame over

14:04.625 --> 14:20.285
whether we should tear the old water tower down. 
The then department head of Modern Languages,

14:21.086 --> 14:28.776
whose name I've forgotten, who retired or It 
doesn't ring a bell. His name starts with D, I

14:30.618 --> 14:33.142
think. He fought for keeping the water tower. I 
never thought I'd see somebody from liberal arts,

14:36.266 --> 14:40.391
you know, doing that. Anyway, it went down, and we 
got a new one. It was all pretty much...

14:49.863 --> 14:52.186
Describe the department that you took over. 
Consisted of three people. Oh, that's all? One who

14:59.028 --> 15:19.587
had just arrived, one who had been around, 
Marianne Piotrowski, who had excellent

14:59.028 --> 15:19.587
credentials, master's from Sabon and a doctorate 
from the London School, and then some guy that John

14:59.028 --> 15:19.587
had picked up with a master's degree that lasted a 
year. I mean, it was pitiful. And the courses were

15:21.329 --> 15:23.331
all descriptive. A lot of insurance courses 
taught by And he was on the city council. Herschel

15:32.876 --> 15:33.517
Burgess? No, no, he died. Burgess, Keshner, his 
wife.

15:42.649 --> 15:44.792
Well, it's easy to look up. Anyway, he taught all 
these insurance courses. Wayne Etter and I became

15:47.115 --> 15:49.699
pretty close. He was my assistant department 
head, which left only Piotrowski. who was a real

15:55.443 --> 16:01.731
nice guy, but he reached sixty-five in a couple 
years now, and in those days that was it. Anyway,

16:02.933 --> 16:13.706
well, he threw out all the finance courses, I mean 
all of the insurance courses, kept one, risk

16:02.933 --> 16:13.706
management, and revitalized the whole program. 
Yeah, you all were housed office-wise where? Oh,

16:17.952 --> 16:25.281
next to the library in the old, what was the name of 
it, the veterinary medicine school. then we

16:26.577 --> 16:51.640
spread into the engineering school in fact I had 
Benson's old office for a while and

16:26.577 --> 16:51.640
then the the year well that was a later time when I 
was acting dean anyway I had to have heart surgery

16:26.577 --> 16:51.640
when I was 77 that was six years after I'd been 
department head, almost finishing my sixth year.

16:57.485 --> 16:58.307
Alright, let's back up. Do you remember any 
personal reaction when you heard that Mr. Rutter

16:59.068 --> 17:07.283
was ill or that he had died? Well, I think there was 
great concern on campus about, naturally, one

17:09.440 --> 17:15.887
wonders about the successor. I remember John 
Pearson calling me to tell me who the successor

17:15.947 --> 17:30.583
was, and I hadn't even heard of him, General 
Ludicke, who I think was the ideal guy for the time.

17:30.643 --> 17:33.186
Yes, I agree. Oh, but there was great sorrow. I 
remember going to the service, as I'm sure you do,

17:35.344 --> 17:43.915
and LBJ and Lady Bird were there, everybody who was 
in it. The Shivers, the Connellys, and Teague and

17:43.935 --> 17:47.519
all. And it was in Jolly Raleigh, yeah, and it was a 
full house. Yes, yes. Impressive. Now, did you

17:57.592 --> 18:01.857
have any interaction with Wayne Hall? Only when I 
first came. I was very impressed with him.

18:08.215 --> 18:09.938
Alright, then with Bill Graff, did you? Hardly 
any. Alright, he followed as chief academic

18:12.061 --> 18:14.906
officer. And, alright, when you first got here, 
almost all male students. As I once said to

18:23.820 --> 18:29.970
somebody, you walked across the campus propelled 
on a sea of Howdies. It was, I found that a little

18:31.047 --> 18:42.722
hard to take, hardly any women in the classes, but 
one saw the signs of its changing, and so I took

18:31.047 --> 18:42.722
heart from that. Alright, then Jack Williams 
comes. Did you have any communication with him

18:45.987 --> 18:50.833
early on? Not early on. I became, along with a chap 
in the engineering college advisor to the Black

18:58.925 --> 19:05.496
Awareness Committee. And they were taking 
actions without we advisors even knowing what was

19:07.839 --> 19:17.695
going on. So we did have a meeting with Jack 
Williams and, oh geez, who was head of the

19:27.157 --> 19:30.581
admissions office for so long, not the old guy. Not 
Heaton? No, after Heaton. Ed Cooper? Ed Cooper.

19:33.824 --> 19:37.228
Cooper was William's advisor for a while, wasn't 
he? Went over, mostly we talked with Cooper about

19:38.289 --> 19:41.533
the problem. Nothing ever came of it, but it all 
worked out all right. But that was the early, I

19:46.258 --> 19:52.304
don't know how I got involved with black 
awareness, but somehow I did. Let's review that a

19:52.324 --> 19:55.628
minute. Given your experience at a few other 
places and here, do you remember any problems that

19:56.249 --> 20:08.440
black students had here? How did, how were race 
relations in those early years here? Well, there

20:13.924 --> 20:20.670
were so few blacks that there didn't seem to be, and 
there were almost none in the College of Business.

20:20.770 --> 20:25.935
I don't, I honestly don't remember ever having a 
black student in class. in those days or even in

20:26.658 --> 20:31.004
subsequent years. In my years here until 1980, I 
really don't remember any incidents, any

20:31.985 --> 20:40.176
problems, any difficulties. I don't either. I 
remember being amazed when one of, when the

20:41.518 --> 20:50.991
student body president of Black was elected, Fred 
McClure, that just blew my mind. I thought that was

20:51.371 --> 20:54.876
really, I was impressed with the following. that 
generally I thought race relations in Texas were a

20:55.160 --> 21:06.392
whole lot better than they were in Louisiana, even 
though South Louisiana was better than North

20:55.160 --> 21:06.392
Louisiana. And incidentally, an aside, sometime 
in the last year and a half, there were two programs

21:07.814 --> 21:22.450
on NPR, one on how New Orleans handled the school 
desegregation or desegregation generally, and

21:22.430 --> 21:26.994
how Houston handled it. And the differences were 
stark. And what was the name of our black board

21:30.017 --> 21:34.961
member? There was a doctor. Anyway, he played 
apparently a major undercover role in Houston on

21:39.185 --> 21:44.750
that deal. Yes, I think so. I don't know what was his 
name. Because to me, one of the interesting

21:48.614 --> 21:52.437
features of the race relations here is we have a 
number of youngsters from farms and ranches and

21:52.838 --> 22:03.971
other rural settings, as well as urban 
youngsters, and things seemed to mesh reasonably

21:52.838 --> 22:03.971
well. They did that. I do seem to recall that one of 
the early coaches when I came, football coaches,

22:05.753 --> 22:21.512
seemed not ever inclined to have a black on the 
team, but when blacks started doing good things

22:23.062 --> 22:25.046
for the football team. I think that helped the 
whole picture, too. Well, Emery Ballard

22:28.071 --> 22:34.242
certainly recruited a number of black players 
when he- Yes, it was his predecessor, whoever that

22:28.071 --> 22:34.242
was. Alright, what were, how and who and when and 
why did the business program begin to grow? I

22:47.716 --> 22:55.826
suppose it really began to grow when it was set up as 
a separate college. That gave it more prestige. We

22:58.209 --> 23:03.195
sought accreditation from the AACSB and got it. On 
the first try? Yes.

23:10.264 --> 23:14.449
I believe so.

23:16.673 --> 23:25.442
The strong departments, accounting had always 
been a strong department, even back when it was

23:16.673 --> 23:25.442
apparently in agriculture. Bill Adams, for 
example, has a College of Agriculture degree in

23:25.802 --> 23:30.427
accounting. My department, there were ten people 
in it when I stepped down six years later. Or was it

23:36.834 --> 23:38.896
eight years? It was eight years. Two four-year 
terms I had. What we did was appeal to

23:44.399 --> 23:58.180
graduate students, particularly in 
agricultural finance. And so we brought in a

23:58.941 --> 24:11.841
number of graduate students and said, remember in 
the early days, if you were a department head, you

23:58.941 --> 24:11.841
got a printout showing by professor what the 
earnings were, by department, And per faculty

24:12.293 --> 24:20.443
member, my department was earning far more money 
than any others. We didn't have a big

24:20.844 --> 24:26.731
undergraduate group like management did, you 
know, they had to take all the students. So we were

24:26.751 --> 24:33.339
really, and I was able to get some pretty good money 
out of Pearson for graduate assistants. We had at

24:33.399 --> 24:38.706
one time half of all the assistantship money in the 
College of Business. So we were quite successful.

24:42.109 --> 24:49.680
I hired Pete Rose, kind of a fluke, out of Dallas for 
a bank, a Federal Reserve bank. He knew Don

24:50.221 --> 24:58.793
Frazier, who's now the head of the Department of 
Finance, and the two of them made banking a strong

24:50.221 --> 24:58.793
subsection of that. So our department and all the 
others took off. Was there ever any kind of,

25:09.584 --> 25:15.071
committee or any other group that made a detailed 
plan of action for business? Or was this

25:16.433 --> 25:18.235
department by department? I've never heard of any 
master plan. No, there wasn't. All right.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.182
Describe Pearson as a dean. How did he operate?

25:31.111 --> 25:32.813
I may have to edit this afterwards. Okay. Toward 
the end, he and I had some problems.

25:40.364 --> 25:50.437
Every Monday we would have a department heads 
meeting and we'd talk about things but nothing

25:40.364 --> 25:50.437
would ever come of it. It used to drive me nuts. One 
of my fellow department heads would always keep

25:54.222 --> 26:02.913
bringing stuff up and I kept trying to tell him on 
the side, don't bring it up because nothing's

25:54.222 --> 26:02.913
going to happen. So that was a disturbing thing for 
me. And I know it galled John when I was made acting

26:09.173 --> 26:15.417
head when he automatically submitted his 
admission you know his resignation when he was

26:16.443 --> 26:45.049
seen and

26:16.443 --> 26:45.049
Jarvis Miller came in he submitted his 
resignation like a cabinet member would to the

26:16.443 --> 26:45.049
president of the United States and Jarvis Miller 
picked it up Jarvis and he had apparently been in

26:16.443 --> 26:45.049
the Dominican Republic or something years 
earlier and gotten at swords points So John was

26:45.569 --> 26:46.553
out. Well, I was asked to be acting dean. I don't 
think that said well with John. But we did have some

26:57.331 --> 26:57.812
Bad times. Subsequently, we made up, because we 
used to party a lot together. There was a bunch of

27:02.697 --> 27:07.943
folks, including John, who was good on a guitar and 
a banjo. We'd sit around our pool lot there and

27:08.724 --> 27:11.948
play. Let's see. Describe Williams as university 
president from your point of view. He seemed like

27:19.577 --> 27:21.299
the ideal president. I think the faculty just 
thought the world of him.

27:29.140 --> 27:36.207
I was impressed with, I think he was just the ideal 
guy to succeed. When I'm very biased, I agree with

27:37.268 --> 27:39.130
you. Yeah, I know you do. Well, I think the whole 
faculty, anybody who was around. Why do you think

27:43.834 --> 27:44.715
they did? Well, he was a classy guy, for one thing. 
He knew what a real university was about, and

27:47.678 --> 27:57.207
he was very affable. Certainly not military, 
although his specialty was duels. But he had a very

28:04.881 --> 28:09.227
distinguished marine career in World War II. 
Yeah, most of us didn't even know about it, I guess.

28:12.751 --> 28:22.705
And I believe Bob Walker told me that he one time, at

28:12.751 --> 28:22.705
William's house, There were some Marines there, 
and they cajoled him into putting on his old

28:23.157 --> 28:27.881
uniform. Oh, be darned. And that nobody else that 
I've ever talked to ever saw him in the uniform. No.

28:32.725 --> 28:35.448
And I never heard him talk about his military. If 
I'm not mistaken, he was wounded two or three

28:36.028 --> 28:39.751
times. Is that right? I think he made five 
landings. He was decorated and so forth. Let me

28:46.497 --> 28:47.498
share with you Mr. Rudder's

28:47.998 --> 28:52.202
recommendation. to Fort Albritton and John 
Lindsay of why they should go get Jack Williams if

28:53.397 --> 29:01.546
something ever happened to Rutter. The heart of it 
was his experience at Clemson, a separate land

29:03.548 --> 29:23.370
grant school in the south, once all male, once 
compulsory military, once had a corps, once

29:03.548 --> 29:23.370
segregated, limited curriculum, off the main 
highway, 100 miles from the state capitol where

29:03.548 --> 29:23.370
the state university was. that he had been through 
experiences there just like we had been. And that

29:28.132 --> 29:36.124
he was very, very well regarded in our education as 
a leader. Coordinating. And in the coordinating

29:36.965 --> 29:38.187
board. He also was the University of Tennessee, 
wasn't he? He was the number two man in the

29:42.593 --> 29:47.360
Tennessee system at the time they went after him. 
Yeah. He had left Austin and gone to Tennessee.

29:51.907 --> 29:52.007
Yeah. I heard good vibes from Tennessee about him. 
So I understand. And I can't remember that

29:58.330 --> 30:01.577
legendary president at Tennessee. Andy Holt. 
Andy Holt. That Andy Holt was one of his role

30:03.601 --> 30:06.306
models. And the more I know about Andy Holt, the 
more I can see a little bit of Jack Williams, that

30:07.067 --> 30:14.923
Andy was vexed. Very, very, very skillful, I 
gather. He was a consummate politician, and he

30:18.371 --> 30:23.197
knew what it was all about. It was said that you 
could go to the headwaters of any creek, depending

30:23.438 --> 30:32.369
upon how you pronounce it, in Tennessee, and 
somebody up there would know. That's what I heard.

30:35.573 --> 30:40.860
Did you have any interaction with Williams that 
you can pass on to this machine? No, not really. Any

30:44.083 --> 30:48.047
William stories, anecdotes? No, I was aware that 
Dave Maxwell and he used to trade

30:48.067 --> 30:55.694
jokes.

30:57.636 --> 30:59.237
What was it that they were into?

31:02.040 --> 31:03.761
Play on words kinds of things. Puns and all? Yeah, 
puns. No, I really was, you know, at that time, in

31:11.198 --> 31:11.960
the trenches. I do remember that when I was named 
acting dean, the press interviewed me as acting

31:12.121 --> 31:23.537
dean of the business school. And I was 
complimentary of John Pearson, and Jack Williams

31:24.344 --> 31:30.231
called me and thanked me for that. By then, he was 
having his problems with the board. Alright,

31:37.199 --> 31:43.466
let's jump forward then and get you closer to being 
in the key role. Under, you were acting dean for how

31:45.168 --> 31:48.512
long? A year. A year. And then went back to the 
department?
