WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:24.298
At this point had the responsibility that I did 
when I was associate director, namely budgets and

00:02.714 --> 00:24.298
preparing requests

00:02.714 --> 00:24.298
to go to the legislature and essentially looking 
over the projects and lining up things. Who did

00:26.540 --> 00:30.985
A&M's legislative work then? Who were the key Who 
were the key folks? Bob Cherry. Bob Cherry. He

00:37.540 --> 00:43.106
worked the legislature and also was the 
right-hand man for the board? That's right.

00:47.811 --> 00:50.574
And did he keep you and others well informed?

00:53.297 --> 00:53.797
Not really.

00:56.921 --> 01:00.885
Did you as a new senior administrator get any 
advice or direction or guidelines from board

01:01.540 --> 01:08.289
members or legislators or former students? Not 
from former students, but from the legislators,

01:09.431 --> 01:15.239
yes, and from the board members, yes. Can you 
mention some key people that attempted to give you

01:15.319 --> 01:23.110
guidance?

01:24.693 --> 01:27.698
I think the board as a whole tried to give me 
guidance. You see, at that particular point, we

01:28.038 --> 01:30.181
did something. Patterson had really started it. 
And that was to take this huge monstrosity or this

01:33.987 --> 01:52.776
huge mix of things that we had of stations out in the 
Experiment Station and convert them to a much

01:33.987 --> 01:52.776
smaller group, which he called Research and 
Extension Centers.

01:55.895 --> 02:05.625
And

01:55.895 --> 02:05.625
when I was still associate director, I went up with 
Earl Rudder one day. We used to call him the East

02:05.685 --> 02:16.395
Texas Pasture Research Station, Research 
Center, and this kind of a thing. And that summer, a

02:17.256 --> 02:21.480
curious kind of occurrence happened was that the 
Texas Sheep and Goat Raisers Association met. And

02:29.873 --> 02:41.628
they there, they were at that time, maybe they 
still are, quite a resolutionizing group

02:29.873 --> 02:41.628
of people. And

02:43.130 --> 02:48.497
so they resolved And one of the resolutions was to 
give, criticize Texas A&M University and the

02:49.945 --> 03:04.179
university system very heavily for not being 
responsible to the sheep and goat raisers. At the

03:05.140 --> 03:18.113
same time, they were very

03:05.140 --> 03:18.113
complimentary of the station out at San Angelo was 
doing the kind of work they were doing. You see,

03:18.835 --> 03:25.984
what they were doing was they were not, in their 
minds, they were separating these stations from

03:18.835 --> 03:25.984
the main center. So coming back from a visit with 
the folks at Monday, which was another political

03:26.005 --> 03:41.485
situation, Earl Runner leaned over to me and he 
says, why don't you call all of these people, why

03:26.005 --> 03:41.485
don't you call all these centers, Texas A&M 
Center, at so-and-so. So I went back and drafted

03:42.528 --> 03:50.178
and had a secretary to do just the first draft of 
things. And I said, is this what you mean? He says,

03:52.562 --> 03:53.583
yeah, give it to me. And before I knew it, the Board 
of Regents

03:54.204 --> 04:04.097
had approved all of these names.

04:05.039 --> 04:15.649
So one fell swoop, it became Texas A&M University 
Research and Extension, Agricultural Research

04:05.039 --> 04:15.649
and Extension at Lubbock, Agricultural Research 
and Extension at this. And so it was at this point

04:16.810 --> 04:24.618
that I decided, well, we were really going to put 
these things in place. So I appointed a committee

04:25.619 --> 04:34.287
to go around to these various places, and I said, 
you know, we have problems of locations. because

04:35.212 --> 04:47.346
the legislators

04:35.212 --> 04:47.346
in many aspects of the situation believe that 
these centers ought to be in the middle of the

04:35.212 --> 04:47.346
agricultural world.

04:50.249 --> 05:00.240
And I wasn't quite sure about that, so I set this 
committee out and they came back and they said

04:50.249 --> 05:00.240
these centers need to be associated with cities, 
which I agreed with. And the principal reason for

05:01.064 --> 05:16.262
putting these centers at these cities was that the 
faculty, we could hire reasonably good faculty if

05:01.064 --> 05:16.262
they could have reasonably good areas to live in. 
But if they had to live in Chillicothe or some other

05:17.824 --> 05:27.595
outlying places, a few people like the range 
scientists and the animal husbandmen, You could

05:28.030 --> 05:30.577
put out at those places, but agronomists, no. You 
just were loaded. So I decided we were going to

05:34.388 --> 05:38.138
locate. Well, it...

05:42.982 --> 05:46.467
became quite a football player at that point as we 
went along. We were able to pick up the Renner

05:46.988 --> 06:02.730
Foundation, which is located in Renner, north of 
Dallas, and convert it to Texas A&M University

05:46.988 --> 06:02.730
Agricultural Research and Extension Center at 
Dallas. And it's next door to the University of

06:02.750 --> 06:07.977
Texas at Dallas.

06:08.699 --> 06:22.860
So from place to place we were able to establish and 
get people to give land, to get people to give money

06:08.699 --> 06:22.860
for our buildings, and you could put up a pretty 
good building for $200,000 in those particular

06:08.699 --> 06:22.860
days and time. And the original location of all of 
these research units had been political long ago,

06:23.962 --> 06:33.155
wasn't it? They were political long ago, and they 
remain political as far as this is concerned. And

06:38.483 --> 06:49.835
the most political of the one was the one at U Valley 
which should have been at San Antonio and the one at

06:38.483 --> 06:49.835
Chillicothe which should have been at Wichita 
Falls. Well,

06:49.915 --> 07:01.808
Dolph Briscoe was governor at that particular 
point and so the board decided They took that away

07:02.665 --> 07:06.669
from me and decided we were going to move to U 
Valley. And they said, you build it there and you

07:07.390 --> 07:09.952
build it in a hurry. So I had a way of doing that. I got 
the board to accept an architect that had been at

07:14.858 --> 07:21.124
another place. And they said, you duplicate this 
building right here. So you find now that the

07:25.609 --> 07:30.934
agricultural research and extension centers are 
across the state. Probably as much of a political

07:32.011 --> 07:35.935
situation. Now there's political visibility. 
The one in Dallas now is completely surrounded by

07:40.941 --> 07:47.889
urban

07:40.941 --> 07:47.889
areas. It's a green area. And I'm assuming that the 
realities of that situation in Texas are very

07:52.474 --> 08:00.043
little different from any other state. Wouldn't 
this be about the same in other states? You mean the

08:03.635 --> 08:04.816
location? Yeah. There are no, this is the only 
state that has that kind of setup. Oh, really? Yes.

08:11.543 --> 08:16.568
And that's actually, I think, one of my greatest 
achievements as an administrator. Do we have more

08:18.270 --> 08:24.957
locations than per capita or fewer? Well,

08:29.875 --> 08:30.956
Probably so. Probably more? You see, California 
had some, and most of those eventually became

08:32.959 --> 08:45.654
University of California at so-and-so, and 
various places of that sort. Florida had what they

08:47.316 --> 08:52.562
call A-R-E-C, agricultural research 
extensions. My concept was that these need to be

08:54.585 --> 08:59.190
educational centers as well as research centers. 
In that year before Mr. Rutter's illness, or two

08:59.542 --> 09:09.220
years, did you and O.D. Butler and Mr. Rutter 
sometimes go to reserve meetings together? Only

09:15.505 --> 09:17.968
Only as the division met. And that was how often? 
Once a year. Oh, okay.

09:26.038 --> 09:29.603
Did you ever see, did Mr. Rutter have much of a sense 
of humor? Did you ever see him? I've heard him

09:31.585 --> 09:32.607
laugh, yes.

09:36.171 --> 09:40.657
When did you see him really get angry over 
something? Really unhappy? I don't know that I

09:44.081 --> 09:45.343
ever did. I did see him in action as a political 
person. Oh, describe that. And he went to, well

09:51.237 --> 10:04.665
there was a bit of money being made available to the 
Department of Interior for water research and the

10:06.451 --> 10:21.810
enabling legislation nationally, sort of put it 
at the Land Grant University, but we had some

10:06.451 --> 10:21.810
trouble with the possibility that some of this 
stuff could go out to Texas Tech.

10:24.573 --> 10:31.041
And so the legislature was, and the senator who had 
built this, putting this bill in to move it

10:31.325 --> 10:43.300
someplace, Earl Rudder went down to see him, and 
you should have seen the shouting that went on in

10:31.325 --> 10:43.300
that one. But that was the only time I'd ever seen or 
heard Earl Rudder shout. And which board? Senator

10:50.349 --> 10:51.511
Krueger, by the way. Senator Krueger. What about 
our local legislative delegation, Bill Moore and

10:57.987 --> 11:00.230
and various state representatives. Did you see 
them in action much during the Rutter years? Yes.

11:06.099 --> 11:06.540
Describe. I think fundamentally Bill Moore was as 
much of a supporter of this university as any, and

11:07.341 --> 11:19.680
the fact is he didn't like for anything to be 
outside of this College Station Bryan. And so

11:22.144 --> 11:24.147
anything here he would, he would support anything 
away. He would drag foot. And did you work at all

11:29.725 --> 11:31.868
with Brownrick Dewey? Yes, I had Brownie, yes. He 
was quietly efficient, wasn't he? Quietly

11:37.976 --> 11:39.258
efficient, yes. Did you, in those, in the 60s, did 
any board member ever deal with you directly, or

11:42.001 --> 11:50.872
did they go through Mr. Rudder appropriately? 
They came at me directly. Is that right? Yeah. What

11:55.970 --> 11:57.012
were their concerns? Oh, usually small 
directions and this kind of a thing. Did they ever

12:01.597 --> 12:11.329
try to

12:01.597 --> 12:11.329
tell you what to fund or who to appoint? No. They 
didn't get involved in the details? They didn't

12:14.813 --> 12:16.796
get involved in the whole situation. Did you go to 
board meetings in those, in the voter years? I went

12:20.220 --> 12:21.842
to board meetings in those days. And he, as a matter 
of fact, is the associate director of the station.

12:26.632 --> 12:30.255
I went to the executive committee and Errol 
Rudder's executive committee meetings.

12:31.397 --> 12:32.117
Describe those. Who was at his executive 
committee meetings? The four or five deans and two

12:35.941 --> 12:42.528
associate directors.

12:42.548 --> 12:43.750
Were there minutes kept? Were there votes taken? I 
think so, I think so, but most of it you'd have

12:46.983 --> 12:52.490
people like Fred Benson. We'd talk softly at him. 
Patterson was pretty quiet. Which of those

12:58.398 --> 13:02.563
individuals do you think Earl Rudder listened to 
most? I'd say Fred Benson. I would have been

13:06.067 --> 13:10.934
surprised if you had not.

13:11.514 --> 13:13.337
Why was Benson so effective? He was quiet and very 
logical.

13:20.935 --> 13:21.696
Highly logical.

13:24.381 --> 13:37.002
He and I, I enjoyed being with him as a co-dean,

13:24.381 --> 13:37.002
as a level, not as a co-dean, but at the same... Oh, 
oh, oh, I was trying to figure out what word you were

13:24.381 --> 13:37.002
saying. You were saying as a fellow dean, yeah. 
Fellow dean, is what I meant to say.

13:42.972 --> 13:44.354
Was he your favorite colleague? He had to be, yeah. 
Did y'all ever get together socially, you deans

13:48.560 --> 13:53.026
and directors? In the Earl Rudder days, yes. In the 
Jack Williams days, yes. And heads of departments

13:59.534 --> 14:01.957
used to get together socially. We'd have social 
events when I was dean. Where were they held? At

14:06.803 --> 14:08.765
various homes, mostly. Coat and tie? Coat and tie. 
Were alcoholic beverages served? Sometimes. I

14:18.715 --> 14:25.123
remember Fred Benson saying that when he first got 
here, if you served alcoholic beverages, you

14:18.715 --> 14:25.123
closed the shades.

14:29.489 --> 14:31.111
Probably so. In those, in the 60s, where did you and 
other couples, where did you all go eat, if you're

14:31.312 --> 14:41.124
going to eat, you're going to dine out?

14:45.550 --> 14:46.311
Coach Norton's. Okay.

14:50.947 --> 14:51.408
Tom's.

14:54.332 --> 15:00.181
At about that time, well in the 60s, about that time 
some of the clubs were being developed. And what

15:01.523 --> 15:09.756
were the events on campus that you and your spouses 
normally attended? Oh, student club banquets and

15:11.318 --> 15:18.810
things of the sort, particularly in April we were 
going. And then, of course, our old rudder would

15:20.005 --> 15:25.993
have a dinner for somebody. Did

15:26.154 --> 15:35.326
the rudders ever have a dinner for the deans and so 
forth at the old president's house?

15:39.432 --> 15:40.253
I don't know. I don't recall. I don't either. Did 
you as dean go to the Ag Ball? Did faculty and

15:46.882 --> 15:48.865
students? and administrators go to the boot dance 
and the ring dance and things like that? We had

15:54.016 --> 15:55.698
invitations to all of them. But did you go? Oh, yes. 
Oh, did you? Okay. Cotton ball, that's what I was

16:00.383 --> 16:02.025
trying to think of. Cotton ball. Now, that was a big 
event, wasn't it? That was a big event. Of course,

16:05.409 --> 16:08.874
that died under my years. I finally killed it. 
Well, it just withered away, didn't it? It just

16:12.117 --> 16:14.620
withered away, yeah. As in your first... months or 
years of being of having these big

16:19.388 --> 16:41.650
responsibilities what were some of the first real 
difficult matters that you had to deal with the one

16:19.388 --> 16:41.650
you mentioned was the the the locations and all of 
that well political locations with the centers

16:19.388 --> 16:41.650
and things predominant things what about 
research topics and projects uh

16:46.135 --> 16:52.487
I don't know that I dealt with them, but I don't know 
that it was considered a problem. One of the things

16:53.929 --> 16:56.694
was that I became an administrator. I decided that 
the College of Agriculture

16:56.975 --> 17:04.228
was going to have to move toward the scientific 
group. And as we replaced faculty, we would move

17:06.723 --> 17:13.445
more and more into the scientific area. I had some 
difficulty problems with finding somebody to

17:14.448 --> 17:20.327
head the Department of Biochemistry. because I 
didn't know all of these situations. Sometimes I

17:27.850 --> 17:34.979
find a difficulty of finding heads of departments 
moving in, particularly in some of these others.

17:35.059 --> 17:37.362
We didn't use the committee system. I found it very 
useful later on as far as the approach was

17:38.543 --> 17:45.011
concerned. I lost a lot of confidence in the 
committee system when we through the years,

17:50.497 --> 18:15.508
largely because they could be managed by

17:50.497 --> 18:15.508
people who had certain concerns and things of the 
sort, and sometimes you had to take over if you were

17:50.497 --> 18:15.508
going to change direction, you were going to have 
to do this through the head of the department.

18:16.231 --> 18:23.119
In biochemistry, what were you hoping at the time 
you said the problem, what was the problem? Well,

18:23.622 --> 18:31.231
the problem was to try to find somebody who could 
lead the department toward science and upgraded

18:23.622 --> 18:31.231
in science. And we eventually, I eventually did 
this. I did get a hold of Gene Santer, who is now Dean

18:32.873 --> 18:38.879
of Agriculture at the University of Arizona. But 
Gene, he wasn't as strong a biochemist as the

18:40.401 --> 18:49.191
faculty would have liked and so forth. But he did 
turn it around, and of course the Department of

18:49.171 --> 18:55.897
Biochemistry now is largely a molecular biology 
department. And what has bothered me a little bit

18:57.699 --> 19:09.369
about the change is that the momentum, which I 
think I started,

18:57.699 --> 19:09.369
essentially ended up the legacy. It was called the 
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. That

19:14.074 --> 19:15.195
was an interesting battle. Describe that. Well, 
of course, the people in science, Dean Fackler, I

19:17.302 --> 19:31.562
tried it for 20 years, and first I couldn't get my 
own faculty, my own heads of departments,

19:17.302 --> 19:31.562
essentially, to move in that direction. And I'd 
propose ideas and get absolute results. I'd drop

19:37.029 --> 19:41.115
them, and I'd come back a little bit later. As we 
went into it, essentially, I had a decision that I

19:41.517 --> 19:47.502
was going to make this. By that time, I was just 
dean. I didn't have any responsibilities as far as

19:50.045 --> 19:54.809
Experiment Station or Extension Service was 
concerned. And even Clark held a meeting of

19:56.471 --> 20:03.537
holding this kind of thing. Richardson took a 
negativity to it, obviously. Fackler didn't want

20:06.079 --> 20:10.123
it.

20:11.639 --> 20:27.376
But things got so bad in the department of biology 
that they essentially

20:11.639 --> 20:27.376
were no longer supporting, the biologists were no 
longer supporting the dean of science. And when I

20:28.297 --> 20:32.361
saw that happening, I immediately shoved it in. Of 
course, that was the end of my career as dean.

20:35.973 --> 20:48.689
Charlie Arnson carried on and it was made so the 
name Agriculture and Life Sciences and I have the

20:35.973 --> 20:48.689
title of Dean Emeritus, Agriculture and Life 
Sciences and Agriculture. This is a note for the

20:49.730 --> 20:53.255
typist that you don't need to put in the 
typescript. It's an attempt at dry humor at

20:54.396 --> 21:04.309
Missouri one day as they were talking about adding 
something like that to the title College of

20:54.396 --> 21:04.309
Agriculture. with a straight face at a large 
gathering, I proposed that they consider

21:04.880 --> 21:15.395
renaming it Food, Agriculture, and Resource 
Management. And then I asked them to consider what

21:16.677 --> 21:19.721
the acronym would be. And a few people from across 
the state thought that F-A-R-M would be a very

21:22.265 --> 21:27.893
good.

21:32.039 --> 21:33.942
All right, let's go back chronologically then Mr. 
Rudder becomes ill in early 1970. Right. Were you

21:41.506 --> 21:46.480
and your colleagues aware soon before his illness 
that he was? I had no idea, as a matter of fact. I had

21:49.312 --> 21:54.237
been on a foreign assignment, been out of the 
country. I came back and I got a call in Chicago that

21:54.898 --> 22:06.629
Mr. Rutter wanted me to go to East Pakistan,

21:54.898 --> 22:06.629
Bangladesh. And because our project was coming to 
an end there,

22:15.282 --> 22:21.169
He wanted me to go, and then they told me he was in the 
hospital in Houston. And that was the last we ever

22:21.869 --> 22:23.271
saw of him. I never did see him after that.

22:27.776 --> 22:32.361
So he sent, the last thing he did was send me to Asia. 
Then we have a brief- By the way, I was not

22:34.203 --> 22:37.807
successful. And I'll tell you why I wasn't 
successful. And it

22:45.134 --> 22:52.365
should have given us a lesson to learn. When we had 
the contract to improve the faculty at East

22:53.487 --> 23:07.227
Pakistan Agricultural University, we trained 
every one of those PhDs here.

23:10.492 --> 23:13.757
And so what they got in was a bunch of Aggies against 
the European-trained people, and the chancellor

23:14.227 --> 23:19.936
didn't want any more of that. Or the vice 
chancellor, I should say. Who was that? That's the

23:24.703 --> 23:34.919
vice chancellor in the East Pakistan 
Agricultural University, the Bangladesh

23:24.703 --> 23:34.919
Agricultural University. I thought you meant 
here. I thought you meant

23:35.920 --> 23:40.487
here. Mr. Rutter died. We had a period of an interim 
president, and then Jack Williams is selected to

23:42.589 --> 23:55.803
begin in the fall of 1970, November the 1st. Do you 
remember what your first reactions were to his

23:56.904 --> 24:02.350
appointment? My first reaction was very 
positive. As a matter of fact, He came down after

24:06.050 --> 24:07.792
his appointment. I was in the administration and 
he poked his head in my office and said, I'm joining

24:08.233 --> 24:12.219
you. Describe, make believe I'd never seen him or 
known his personality, describe what he looked

24:14.041 --> 24:22.413
like and how he handled himself.

24:25.217 --> 24:27.801
He behaved himself as a real academic. I'm not sure 
I could describe his physiognomy.

24:36.256 --> 24:40.661
He was clearly one who supported me as dean. And

24:40.781 --> 24:47.468
I could go to him and we'd talk things over. His 
office was right above mine.

25:01.064 --> 25:05.048
I considered him tall.

25:07.087 --> 25:07.888
Fairly lean.

25:11.334 --> 25:22.852
Did he seem to understand the realities of 
agriculture far more than any other president has

25:11.334 --> 25:22.852
ever done since, including, well, I'm on your 
side. I agree. Did he ever smile? Oh, yeah. Sure.

25:31.445 --> 25:32.166
Yes. And

25:33.631 --> 25:43.200
did he make an effort, as far as you were aware, to 
learn about the realities of our agriculture

25:33.631 --> 25:43.200
programs? Yes, because right in the middle of his 
career, right in the middle of his career as

25:43.540 --> 25:50.627
deanship, we were building these research and 
extension centers. So I had to, of course, in days

25:50.647 --> 25:57.913
of early winter, he'd walk into the board meeting 
and say, yeah, I want one there here. And gave a

25:59.535 --> 26:01.917
listing of where they ought to be. But after that, 
it had to be far more formal in the approach, and he

26:02.217 --> 26:08.707
would help out. But we would talk about these 
situations.

26:13.575 --> 26:20.727
Did he, as far as you were aware, did he listen to 
you, did Williams listen to you and the other

26:13.575 --> 26:20.727
senior administrators? I think so. I think so. 
What do you think his goals were for A&M?

26:31.597 --> 26:35.242
What kind of school did he want this to be? Well, I 
imagined

26:35.262 --> 26:47.298
and perceived that he wanted Texas A&M University 
to be a great university in the academic sense. Was

26:48.479 --> 26:50.522
that consistent with what your goals were? That 
was consistent with my goals. What did you have?

26:54.087 --> 26:59.494
And I

26:54.087 --> 26:59.494
think that the goals are still that. The 
difference now compared to when I was there was the

27:00.200 --> 27:10.722
fact that I did not want to leave my roots in 
agriculture. And I see we're now losing our roots

27:11.844 --> 27:18.478
in agriculture as an institution. What were your, 
at that point, did you have any other institutions

27:18.779 --> 27:28.432
that you, in agriculture, that you were kind of 
using as your model? Cornell. Cornell.

27:29.873 --> 27:32.136
Wisconsin. Maybe Davis, Les Davis though. When 
you, when you first took over as an administrator,

27:37.023 --> 27:48.077
about where do you think we honestly ranked in 
agriculture nationally?

27:51.517 --> 27:52.959
Oh, I'd say below the bottom. Not in the top ten.

27:57.886 --> 27:58.527
And today? And I think after today, well, it was in 
the top ten. It was definitely four or five, maybe

28:02.793 --> 28:08.842
even higher than that, depending upon what you're 
looking at it. And what were you asking? And did you

28:13.468 --> 28:18.115
have any high priority projects, programs that 
you wanted to get done? Well, the highest priority

28:23.410 --> 28:35.851
project that I wanted to get done is essentially 
turn and get established molecular biology and

28:23.410 --> 28:35.851
what is known as biotechnology on the campus. 
Where did you get the money for that? Well, you

28:38.015 --> 28:39.537
stole it from other projects. You just closed out 
other projects. I did this thing in a very

28:41.770 --> 29:01.163
interesting way rather than doing as

28:41.770 --> 29:01.163
currently situations where you bring in the 
positions and then think

28:41.770 --> 29:01.163
about them and think of a sort and then redo this. I 
had, in my own mind, established a thought of where

29:01.463 --> 29:15.020
we needed to go, and as a position occurred, if the 
head of department didn't dream for it, I took that

29:01.463 --> 29:15.020
position and put it in another department. And 
during your years in that- Without saying

29:16.401 --> 29:22.269
anything, I didn't, I was very quiet. I didn't have 
a committee or anything of the sort. I just, it was

29:25.973 --> 29:30.559
more of a individual type of administration. 
where you did what you wanted to do by changing the

29:30.826 --> 29:36.555
funding operation. Who were the key people you 
turned to here on the campus and elsewhere for

29:37.056 --> 29:44.768
advice and counsel and opinions?

29:48.454 --> 29:59.010
Well, I think

29:48.454 --> 29:59.010
the people that were around me in the 
administration. Heads of departments. Bill

30:04.174 --> 30:04.675
Pope. Terry Greathouse when he came in. At least I 
try ideas on them. Various heads of departments.

30:18.190 --> 30:20.372
Hobgood. That's Merle Hobgood? No. What's his 
name? Price? Price Hobgood. Price Hobgood.

30:31.812 --> 30:36.899
And your key staff members at that time were, were 
whom? Well I have, actually some of the key staff

30:38.401 --> 30:45.271
members would seem to be in and around, well it was 
O.D. and there was Perry Atkinson and these people

30:45.351 --> 30:57.848
before they went up into administration were 
people that I would listen to. The, and under

30:58.729 --> 31:01.633
Williams In hindsight, so real progress is made, 
then, am I correct? That's correct. But you see,

31:11.228 --> 31:16.416
that was also the time in which the enrollment was 
increasing and the funding was increasing. So

31:17.258 --> 31:24.910
there was the opportunity to develop because you 
had new programs and developing and then the

31:17.258 --> 31:24.910
growth of the university. All right, and then 
Williams has a heart attack. were you aware that he

31:32.107 --> 31:39.619
was in bad health no i surely wasn't either and i saw 
him on
