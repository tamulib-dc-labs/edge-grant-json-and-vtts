00:01.229 --> 00:04.313
We are talking about the freeway system. And I 
bound again in a few licks here about signing and

00:05.114 --> 00:12.063
about the creation of anxiety levels. And I wanted 
to mention for the record the difference,

00:12.144 --> 00:28.165
apparent difference, not just because I'm a 
planner, but I think just because I'm a motorist,

00:12.144 --> 00:28.165
in going from, say, a Houston to a San Diego. and 
using the freeway systems there in the two cities,

00:28.837 --> 00:36.004
or even Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, for example, 
the signing is very anticipatable in the sense

00:37.186 --> 00:45.915
that each exit is announced three times. And the 
first time it's announced, it's at the bottom. The

00:49.899 --> 00:51.360
second time, it's at the middle. And then when you, 
the next time you are at the exit, it's at the top.

00:56.986 --> 00:58.067
And all exits are from the right hand lane unless it 
has been physically impossible because of

00:58.267 --> 01:27.902
historic problems to do otherwise and left hand 
exits are necessitated but it's a pattern that's

00:58.267 --> 01:27.902
exhibited all over the state of California and you 
come to expect that so you know you have three

00:58.267 --> 01:27.902
warnings before you ever have to make your 
maneuver and not only that but the signs are

00:58.267 --> 01:27.902
illuminated at night in all cases and the splits 
for off-ramps and so forth are eliminated before

01:28.321 --> 01:45.202
you get to them, and the signs are placed well in 
advance so that you don't have to make an instant

01:28.321 --> 01:45.202
judgment at the moment of truth before you make 
your action maneuver. And I believe that,

01:45.883 --> 01:54.514
personally, this creates a very low anxiety level 
and it contributes to the safety of the use of the

01:45.883 --> 01:54.514
freeway system. There's one other thing I'd like 
to mention in connection with freeway design in

01:55.304 --> 02:14.116
urban areas, and that is its appearance in terms of 
relationship between man-made construction and

01:55.304 --> 02:14.116
the use of plant materials. Of course, California 
is blessed with a certain climate that enables

02:21.241 --> 02:26.167
things to stay green and flowering throughout the 
year, at least in the southern part of the state.

02:26.688 --> 02:49.797
But even in the northern part of the state, where 
they have frosts and snow and so forth, there is an

02:26.688 --> 02:49.797
attempt made to put plant materials there that are 
native, require low maintenance, and that

02:26.688 --> 02:49.797
contribute to a kind of a softness of the sometimes 
necessarily harsh man-made constructions in

02:26.688 --> 02:49.797
terms of cuts and bridge structures and so forth. 
And I really would like to see something done more

02:55.860 --> 03:05.673
along those lines throughout Texas, but 
particularly in the urban areas such as Houston.

03:06.073 --> 03:07.595
Well, I think we'll see those things. I think with 
reference to the signing, I'm surprised. note

03:13.047 --> 03:21.657
there's any great difference because the 
interstate system has the one set of design

03:13.047 --> 03:21.657
standards that apply nationwide. Presumably. 
Presumably and certainly I would look for uniform

03:23.059 --> 03:41.620
design standards throughout a state and 
apparently you've noted difference in the

03:23.059 --> 03:41.620
signing of Houston and Dallas and other Texas 
cities so apparently there's more freedom left to

03:42.663 --> 03:49.250
the local district offices within the State 
Highway Department, and I'm aware of it. Of

03:49.530 --> 04:10.273
course, it's well to remember that when the 
interstate highway system had its beginnings,

03:49.530 --> 04:10.273
the choice of the State Highway Commission in 
Texas was to concentrate in the urban areas first,

03:49.530 --> 04:10.273
rather than, say, city or states like Oklahoma and 
Florida that I'm familiar with where they

04:10.540 --> 04:17.447
immediately moved into the rural areas because 
they could get more miles faster, and quite

04:10.540 --> 04:17.447
frankly, needed them more. Their roads built in 
the 30s were really frightful to take care of the

04:18.087 --> 04:25.574
traffic of the early 50s. So those states that had 
poor highways moved into the rural areas. Texas,

04:29.678 --> 04:39.147
with a very excellent highway department over the 
years, had a very excellent rural system, and they

04:29.678 --> 04:39.147
immediately moved into the urban areas. And in 
each urban area, as I understand it, is

04:39.700 --> 04:51.238
established an expressway office to design and 
coordinate construction, the awarding of

04:39.700 --> 04:51.238
contracts, et cetera, inspections. For the, I 
think, one in Dallas, one in Fort Worth, one in

04:52.680 --> 04:59.230
Austin, one in San Antonio, one in Houston. I think 
the urban expressway office in Houston is of those

05:04.743 --> 05:07.246
state highway offices. But even so, I thought they 
had a higher level of uniformity than they do. Let

05:12.572 --> 05:13.914
me give you another example. The freeway bypass 
for Bryan and College Station has on and off ramps,

05:13.974 --> 05:28.852
which by the admission of some people in the Texas 
Transportation Institute are a total disaster.

05:30.234 --> 05:32.877
Which makes it even worse is the fact that the local 
highway district engineers don't realize that

05:33.278 --> 05:37.923
there's any need for completely rebuilding them.

05:41.688 --> 05:49.477
Is College Station in District 12 operates out 
of...

05:50.218 --> 06:00.990
Okay, now let's proceed on, Roscoe, to...

05:50.218 --> 06:00.990
Do you perceive any administrative change within 
the planning department?

06:05.594 --> 06:06.435
That's 11. I don't see any at this time. I'm not 
contemplating making any internal changes

06:09.739 --> 06:15.025
within the department. Has the city, since you've 
been the planning director, made use of the work of

06:16.627 --> 06:27.961
planning consultants?

06:28.902 --> 06:29.803
Very seldom. We had a planning consultant 
Actually, an architecture firm in the

06:34.889 --> 06:38.334
preparation of community shelters. Master plan, 
which was a federally funded project. And the

06:45.985 --> 06:50.531
growth options project in which Rice Center came 
in. But most of the planning work the department

06:51.773 --> 07:00.926
over the years has been with personnel at the 
department. OK. these influences that are listed

07:03.425 --> 07:33.145
here political religious ethnic geographic 
sociological economic and military I think we've

07:03.425 --> 07:33.145
more or less covered as we've been going along but 
the city has now the problem of having expanded

07:03.425 --> 07:33.145
geographically over so much area 525 some square 
miles I believe that

07:33.530 --> 07:41.760
The view now, particularly in view of energy 
concerns, is turning inward again. And there has

07:41.800 --> 07:49.110
been a lot of discussion about the third ward and 
the role of the third ward and the fourth ward in the

07:41.800 --> 07:49.110
city. Would you care to comment on that or any 
expansion of this concept? Well, certainly, the

08:02.453 --> 08:23.345
aging of housing in neighborhoods

08:02.453 --> 08:23.345
is becoming a much greater problem than it was say 
10 years ago and receiving a much higher level of

08:02.453 --> 08:23.345
attention both in cap improvements and planning 
efforts and policy concerns.

08:29.614 --> 08:31.397
I would hesitate to say that there is a great 
movement into the central city of course we're

08:32.407 --> 09:00.827
currently under a sur moratorium that would 
restrict at least some of the developers and

08:32.407 --> 09:00.827
landowners feel like they're restricted from 
creating as high a density of developments as they

08:32.407 --> 09:00.827
would like when those restrictions are lifted 
with completion of the north east plant we

09:01.887 --> 09:10.459
probably will see more density development in the 
eastern half of downtown. The western half, I'm

09:10.479 --> 09:21.055
sorry, where there is a viable market for more 
dense housing. In the eastern half, the growth

09:21.075 --> 09:30.949
options study indicated very few pressures for 
extensive growth and development quite contrary

09:31.655 --> 10:01.442
there is need for a lot of revitalization and a lot 
of upgrading of housing it's going to be hard to

09:31.655 --> 10:01.442
come by at the same time the older areas on the east 
half represent a very good stock of housing in many

09:31.655 --> 10:01.442
respects Houston has facetiously had the wisdom 
to build in this century instead of the previous

10:01.895 --> 10:05.861
one. Therefore, we are not plagued with six-story 
cold-water tenement flats as New York and

10:06.963 --> 10:14.034
Chicago. We're not faced with the high-density 
areas that have become slums that were built in the

10:14.054 --> 10:23.628
1880s and such. The close-in areas of Houston are 
suburban in character. which means that there's a

10:29.232 --> 10:43.494
lot of close in areas that, given a stabilized 
confidence in these areas, can remain as good

10:29.232 --> 10:43.494
housing areas for many, many years. There's been a 
lot of private rehabbing going on in Houston, as I

10:43.514 --> 10:48.983
understand it. Is this making very much of an 
impact on the whole housing stock? I think it would

10:54.752 --> 10:57.636
be hard to find in the statistics. There's no 
question what old houses have been refurbished,

10:58.291 --> 11:13.973
but I think these

10:58.291 --> 11:13.973
are very few compared to the totality of the 
housing stock. But there is definitely

11:15.355 --> 11:24.147
remodeling going on, rehabilitation going on in 
many areas close in. And to some extent, like in, as

11:25.223 --> 11:49.932
in other cities, that the very success of the 
program, or I really can't call it program, the

11:25.223 --> 11:49.932
very success of the many individual investors, 
either as homeowners or as literally speculative

11:25.223 --> 11:49.932
investors in remodeling and reconditioning 
houses, has tended to drive the property up. The

11:50.502 --> 12:07.417
desire of people to live close in with the energy 
prices and traffic congestion is driving the

11:50.502 --> 12:07.417
prices up to where there's a limit to how the market 
that can afford some of

11:50.502 --> 12:07.417
the close in areas. You are the director of a large 
planning agency and as such you are of course

12:07.437 --> 12:19.648
responsible for the performance of the 
professional planners on your staff and in that

12:20.287 --> 12:35.200
respect you are of course concerned about the 
quality of planning education that these

12:20.287 --> 12:35.200
individuals receive before they come to you.

12:39.044 --> 12:48.252
In taking a look at perhaps your own experience 
with planning education and what's happened

12:39.044 --> 12:48.252
subsequently Your thoughts on this would be 
appreciated.

12:57.918 --> 13:08.232
Well,

12:57.918 --> 13:08.232
we were just talking between the tapes there on 
some aspects of this. I shared with you some of the

13:15.721 --> 13:30.759
questioning perhaps that the older one gets, the 
more nostalgic they get about their own education

13:15.721 --> 13:30.759
and the days that they spend at the university, 
particularly in graduate work, become a sort of

13:15.721 --> 13:30.759
golden age.

13:34.203 --> 13:42.994
Certainly, the late 40s and 50s, for planning 
education, there was a very limited number of

13:34.203 --> 13:42.994
planning schools. a very limited number of 
planning students, a very lucrative expanding

13:43.683 --> 14:02.624
job market for planners, and I think the quality of 
planning education during those days was really

13:43.683 --> 14:02.624
at a very high level. The faculty members tended to 
be practitioners, very successful in the

14:03.726 --> 14:11.935
planning field, and really almost with a sense of 
dedication that they gave up their practice and

14:12.573 --> 14:23.947
came back to school. And I think in the 60s, with the 
tremendous expansion of the number of students,

14:24.027 --> 14:41.668
with the somewhat artificial encouragement for 
graduate work in planning, as indeed graduate

14:24.027 --> 14:41.668
work in all areas is a means of avoiding the draft, I 
can't help but feel that the 60s saw a decline in,

14:42.442 --> 14:54.313
certainly, scholarship. A decline in

14:56.335 --> 15:09.327
not only the scholarship, but in the direction 
that education was heading. I think there was a lot

15:09.347 --> 15:12.330
of confusion in the 60s that that caused a lot of 
reevaluation, both in the national planning

15:12.985 --> 15:35.637
profession groups and on the planning schools, 
that I think in many respects was perhaps healthy,

15:12.985 --> 15:35.637
but in many ways a waste of time. I think certainly 
in the late 70s for moving back more to,

15:41.555 --> 16:04.575
I think, higher levels of scholarship,

15:41.555 --> 16:04.575
with job prospects for graduating planners not 
necessarily assured that they're going to find

15:41.555 --> 16:04.575
what they're looking for in terms of the job 
planning. Those that enter the planning

16:05.332 --> 16:22.611
profession, I think, are going to tend to be more 
dedicated, more sincere, rather than, as I'm

16:05.332 --> 16:22.611
afraid some of the 60s were just looking for a 
fabulous quick salary.

16:25.053 --> 16:32.301
But I'm speaking from the outside of the 
educational system now, but certainly

16:33.327 --> 16:45.924
interviewing the planners, I get the sense that we 
are beginning to see dedicated, qualified,

16:33.327 --> 16:45.924
well-trained planners available.

16:45.944 --> 16:50.590
Roscoe, thank you very much for your time and for 
your thoughts. I must thank you on the part of the

16:51.772 --> 17:01.765
Texas chapter of the American Planning 
Association and for the Department of Urban and

16:51.772 --> 17:01.765
Regional Planning at Texas A&M. Well, I 
appreciate the opportunity to participate. I

17:08.420 --> 17:11.344
think it's a marvelous program that you're 
undertaking. And good luck in providing

17:11.444 --> 17:15.028
additional information. Please call. We'll 
probably be asking for some documents. Let me give

17:20.716 --> 17:33.152
you here a listing of city planning publications 
of the department, which I tried to go back beyond

17:20.716 --> 17:33.152
the time that I came here and keep up to date. Not 
only the formal publication, but a lot of the

17:33.875 --> 17:50.387
informal publications that hopefully a goodly 
number of these have gotten to the planning school

17:33.875 --> 17:50.387
libraries and are certainly available here in the 
department library. Mighty fine. This will be

17:51.469 --> 17:52.431
very useful. Thank you.
