00:00.031 --> 00:06.358
Interviewing Dr. Newton Ellis, head of the 
Department of Industrial Engineering. Today's

00:06.919 --> 00:08.701
date is July 29, 1981. Dr. Ellis, could we begin by 
you telling us something about your personal

00:10.883 --> 00:17.431
background, where you grew up?

00:22.256 --> 00:26.661
Well, I was born in Texas. I was born in Northeast 
Texas. But I grew up pretty much all over the U.S. My

00:29.967 --> 00:35.712
dad bought a construction. And as a result, I lived 
in several states and went to several schools,

00:37.994 --> 00:52.847
sometimes as many as a half a dozen to a dozen 
different schools in one year. Where were you born

00:52.867 --> 00:55.749
in? I was born in Paris, Texas. Where were some of 
the states that you lived in? Well, most of the

01:00.713 --> 01:25.833
states

01:00.713 --> 01:25.833
were southwest

01:00.713 --> 01:25.833
states,

01:00.713 --> 01:25.833
picking up from probably as far west as Arizona. It 
was coming around to New Mexico, and then to

01:25.853 --> 01:27.435
Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee. It was for some 
time briefly in New Jersey and New York.

01:31.595 --> 01:33.578
I'm from Louisiana. I've heard you live in 
Louisiana. I'm from the amendment which is 30

01:38.564 --> 01:41.428
miles east of there. When

01:41.508 --> 01:48.056
did you graduate from high school and where? I 
graduated from high school in 1950 from Texas City

01:48.196 --> 01:53.383
High School. You had an interest in mathematics 
and engineering as a student? As a high school

01:59.001 --> 02:10.392
student, I was very much

01:59.001 --> 02:10.392
interested in engineering, math, quantitative 
aspects of education. That's one of the reasons I

02:10.412 --> 02:16.398
wound up at Texas A&M. When you graduated in 1950, 
you went to Texas A&M as a student? I came to Texas

02:19.200 --> 02:20.822
A&M as a freshman. I was majoring in industrial 
engineering, spent three years here, and became

02:21.562 --> 02:33.827
intrigued with the human side of engineering. 
Industrial engineering was the closest to that,

02:33.847 --> 02:40.921
but it didn't quite have what I thought I was 
interested in. That's one of the reasons I didn't

02:40.941 --> 02:41.983
finish my degree. What did you do after you left 
here? Well after, I spent about three years, in

02:45.342 --> 03:02.998
fact I was in

02:45.342 --> 03:02.998
my senior year, and I had a long talk with the wind 
department about my interests that were more

02:45.342 --> 03:02.998
focused in respect to people and less focused in 
the areas of engineering. And he recommended that

03:03.018 --> 03:08.983
I probably ought to look into a different 
curriculum. Not knowing a whole lot about the

03:09.003 --> 03:11.245
curriculums that might be available. which 
focused me on the human being. Someone told me

03:15.682 --> 03:32.638
about psychology

03:15.682 --> 03:32.638
and I transferred to Baylor

03:15.682 --> 03:32.638
and picked up a major

03:15.682 --> 03:32.638
in psychology. I finished there in 1956. Okay, 
what were some of the, since you moved around so

03:33.179 --> 03:39.325
much in your boyhood, what are some of the things 
you remember about that?

03:43.304 --> 03:50.072
Well, did you find that every place was pretty much 
the same, or did you find that there was a lot of

03:43.304 --> 03:50.072
differences? I found there was a lot of 
differences. I guess that was really my first

03:51.433 --> 03:54.236
brush. Again, I was very young still, but it was

03:54.296 --> 04:10.675
my first brush at problems associated

03:54.296 --> 04:10.675
with,

03:54.296 --> 04:10.675
or that had racial overtones associated with it. 
Areas of...

04:13.915 --> 04:37.300
Northeast

04:13.915 --> 04:37.300
Texas and into Louisiana, there was a great 
problem, I would say, with the standpoint of the

04:13.915 --> 04:37.300
lights. I got into Tennessee, and there was a 
problem associated with the, again, I don't know

04:37.320 --> 04:40.203
the exact terminology, so I'll say the hillbilly 
element. That may not be the proper terminology,

04:40.223 --> 04:41.745
but it had those types of overtones. I also

04:43.463 --> 04:56.797
lived in California,

04:43.463 --> 04:56.797
I forgot to mention that. California also was 
going at that particular time, as I recall it, was

04:56.957 --> 05:03.323
the first years of integration. And I remember 
quite a few problems associated with integration

05:03.343 --> 05:05.345
with the school system in San Diego. And I would say 
that traveling around gave me a better

05:05.365 --> 05:09.910
understanding of the people. I probably wouldn't 
have gained by moving in a single area and growing

05:10.919 --> 05:22.190
up in a single area. That was probably the main 
contribution. Other than that, it's seeing some

05:24.292 --> 05:29.537
of the different things that existed in different 
parts of the U.S. In 1956, when you graduated from

05:29.557 --> 05:35.463
Baylor with a bachelor's in psychology, what did 
you do then? Well, I thought I was ready to enter

05:38.105 --> 05:43.071
into something that tied engineering and 
psychology together.

05:45.975 --> 05:49.039
You mean something like efficiency engineering? 
Well, after the fact, I would say this was 56, about

05:49.059 --> 05:58.472
60 really the field of engineering psychology 
began to emerge. Prior to that, I guess I was before

05:58.492 --> 06:01.075
my time, I took a job that I really couldn't find a 
job I was interested in. I discovered

06:10.096 --> 06:16.867
that if you do anything with a psychology degree, 
you need a graduate degree. So I took a job in Temco

06:17.548 --> 06:24.699
Aircraft as the payroll department, payroll 
insurance department. I ran the night shift.

06:25.961 --> 06:26.141
Where? At Grand Prairie. And it was there that 
having that job permitted me to initiate I'm

06:29.978 --> 06:34.985
trying to protect this Christian university. I 
wound up getting a master's degree and a PhD

06:35.005 --> 06:42.136
degree, but during the process, about 61, 
aerospace was beginning to catch on. An emerging

06:42.156 --> 06:50.889
field column at that time called engineering 
psychology was beginning to catch on in

06:42.156 --> 06:50.889
aerospace. It was a technology that was to deal 
with trying to design equipment to fit the person,

06:50.909 --> 06:58.180
to fit the pilot.

07:01.096 --> 07:07.847
It was called engineering psychology. We 
transitioned then to another thing called human

07:07.867 --> 07:12.775
engineering. And over the years, eventually 
transitioned

07:12.795 --> 07:20.929
into a field called human factors engineering. So 
I was perfectly trained in engineering and in

07:20.949 --> 07:23.634
psychology. It was a perfect marriage between my 
training and my interest. Consequently, that was

07:25.056 --> 07:25.737
the reason. spent the time in aerospace after 
graduation. When did you complete your master's?

07:31.990 --> 07:37.240
I completed my master's in 62 and I completed my PhD 
in 64. Both at TCU? Both at TCU. The reason for that,

07:40.526 --> 07:47.640
I was employed at LTV at the time where I 
transitioned to Temco, Chance Fault. I worked at

07:48.059 --> 07:53.325
the Leintemko vintage in Leintemko-Bach, the 
transition companies. Is it still called

07:53.345 --> 07:54.967
Leintemko-Bach? No, it's called LTB. They 
dropped the full use of names and just used

07:56.669 --> 08:01.195
initials. I spent 10 years with them. Okay, then 
that brings us to 1964. What did you do then? Well, I

08:10.386 --> 08:11.887
was employed. At the same time I was working on a 
degree, I was employed. I was in a program

08:14.840 --> 08:31.336
that permitted me to work in the school.

08:31.477 --> 08:36.361
And I was working in the, I believe it was called 
Human Engineering and Safety Department. When I

08:36.381 --> 08:39.745
finished my degree in 64, I had the opportunity to 
go back to where I was, or stay in the department. I

08:39.765 --> 08:43.969
was going to go to a new development department in 
this space. Astronautics Division,

08:44.725 --> 09:02.962
where the emphasis would be placed on designing 
equipment not for the pilot, but for the

08:44.725 --> 09:02.962
astronaut. And I felt like that was at the cutting 
edge of technology, and I chose to go with the

09:02.982 --> 09:06.446
Astronautics Division. I spent the next two years 
or so there, and worked on some space systems. the

09:11.860 --> 09:37.405
design team that worked on some of the spacesuits, 
some of the Jiminy, early Jiminy space missions,

09:11.860 --> 09:37.405
and the development of what was called an 
astronaut maneuvering unit, something that

09:11.860 --> 09:37.405
permitted the astronaut

09:11.860 --> 09:37.405
to buckle on or secure to his back, a la Buck Rogers 
style, and get out of the vehicle and motor around

09:11.860 --> 09:37.405
through space. It was one of the Jiminy missions. 
This was while you were still at LTV? Yes.

09:45.740 --> 09:47.402
Okay, you stayed there until 1969? No, I left 
there. I had an opportunity to move up. It must have

09:56.871 --> 10:04.438
been 1960...

10:04.458 --> 10:07.821
I'll say 66, somewhere in that vicinity. I took a 
job at a

10:08.459 --> 10:25.277
senior scientist of a small research group called 
Life Sciences Incorporated.

10:25.297 --> 10:37.470
It was a high technology research group having to 
do with

10:25.297 --> 10:37.470
human behavior as it related to complex hardware 
systems.

10:42.226 --> 10:55.680
And I spent back time

10:42.226 --> 10:55.680
until I came

10:42.226 --> 10:55.680
in. I was there a couple of years. I don't recall 
exactly

10:58.704 --> 11:04.150
how long. A couple of years or so. It was a small 
group, probably having about 25 employees and all

11:05.651 --> 11:07.213
of them PhDs. And we probably did about a half 
million dollar business. And LTV, with a big

11:09.563 --> 11:18.672
program developing in LTV about 68, I think I was in 
life sciences two years. And they came and asked me

11:18.692 --> 11:25.398
to come back, take a special job in advanced 
systems. It had to do with being a part of a special

11:27.280 --> 11:39.452
group of engineers that were to try to define 
aerospace systems of the future. That intrigued

11:40.512 --> 11:41.393
me. I came back

11:42.014 --> 11:48.283
to it. Okay, Dr. Ellis, would you discuss your 
coming to Texas A&M in 1969, please? Well, I was

11:54.211 --> 12:03.764
right in the middle of a major proposal after LTV, 
and I received a telephone call from a Bill

11:54.211 --> 12:03.764
Wortham. He told me he was head of the Department of 
Industrial Engineering at Texas A&M. He caught me

12:09.554 --> 12:17.542
at a bad time because, like I said, we were in a 
proposal effort. It had been going on for about

12:17.562 --> 12:19.423
three months. We'd probably been spending about 
60 hours a week or more in that proposal effort. He

12:25.569 --> 12:30.934
caught me right as we were beginning to close out, 
and he caught me at a bad time. And he said he wanted

12:31.735 --> 12:36.760
to talk to me about the possibility of a job, a 
teaching job at Texas A&M. I told him that I wasn't

12:38.242 --> 12:53.405
interested in a teaching job at Texas A&M and that 
he had caught me at a bad time and I basically

12:38.242 --> 12:53.405
appreciated it but he didn't keep me and I sort of 
cut him off. But he was a persistent person and he

12:53.425 --> 12:56.790
called me back. At this time we had finished the 
proposal effort and I was in a slow down period and

12:58.213 --> 13:06.966
was in a much better mood. He was a good salesman 
too. He talked to me about some of the things he was

13:09.009 --> 13:13.098
trying to do at Texas A&M. And Bill Wortham turned 
out to be a person that had come from the Dallas area

13:13.118 --> 13:18.269
from Texas Instruments. And he was up to speed on 
what I considered some of the newer developing

13:18.790 --> 13:26.727
engineering technologies at the time. One of them 
happened to be human factors engineering, and he

13:27.533 --> 13:34.262
said he was trying to develop an industrial 
engineering department that would emphasize

13:27.533 --> 13:34.262
these. He talked about maintainability, 
reliability,

13:35.243 --> 13:47.400
safety, and he said, I'm looking for someone to 
help us in the human factors field, and I've been

13:35.243 --> 13:47.400
told you're it.

13:50.324 --> 13:52.166
I told him I really wasn't. Well, I had in the back of 
my mind the idea of coming to into university

13:55.867 --> 13:58.851
sometime to teach, but this was not the time. I was 
very comfortable with where I was. I'd just come

14:01.775 --> 14:05.681
back to LTV and been there probably a year or a 
little less. I can't remember exactly. I told him I

14:07.443 --> 14:12.951
really wasn't interested in a teaching job at this 
time, maybe two or three years. He said, well, why

14:14.754 --> 14:16.696
don't you just come down and visit? Take a look at 
what we've got here. Let's talk. Well, he called me

14:21.027 --> 14:23.390
the time we had just finished that proposal. I 
didn't have a whole lot to do. I was in between sort

14:25.031 --> 14:26.633
of projects. I was trying to catch up on some needed 
rest anyway. And I said, well, as long as there's no

14:30.357 --> 14:34.582
obligation, if you realize that, I'll be glad to 
come down. I've got some extra time. And I came down

14:37.125 --> 14:38.987
and spent a couple of days. And I was sold 
immediately.

14:44.753 --> 14:45.995
Bill Wortham was a good salesman. But more than 
that, I was sold on Texas A&M. I was sold on what the

14:48.538 --> 14:50.680
department was doing. And I was immediately 
caught up in the potential that existed. My wife's

14:57.020 --> 14:59.564
from over in Somerville. She was spending the day 
over there. We came back and we went through

15:02.889 --> 15:05.352
College Station. She said, you know, I could never 
live here. I always lived in the Dallas area. She

15:10.560 --> 15:13.564
said, you could never live in a small community 
like this. I hope you didn't get interested,

15:13.644 --> 15:16.008
weren't interested in a job. And I didn't tell her 
that I was until we got back to Dallas. And a couple

15:20.917 --> 15:24.140
of days later, I told her I was interested in that 
job. She said, oh, no, I don't think we could live

15:24.160 --> 15:27.623
down there. Bryan College Station was much 
smaller then than it is now.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.854
To make a long story short, she said, I'd like to go 
back down. So we came back down. At the time, I think

15:42.756 --> 15:47.440
there was about three houses available in the 
whole community to look at. And they were

15:48.982 --> 15:50.383
building. Oaks out here, and was actually 
building a house that she was sort of interested

15:50.903 --> 15:56.389
in. Anyway, we came back, and she said, well, of 
course, if I wanted to come, she certainly would

15:56.409 --> 16:03.456
like to come with me and learn about that. But she 
made the deal. She said, well, I'll tell you what.

16:07.701 --> 16:15.248
You'll purchase a house like we have here, and 
you'll always get season tickets to all the

16:07.701 --> 16:15.248
sporting events. She's a big sports fan. Maybe 
I'll, not kidding me, she said, maybe I can move

16:17.178 --> 16:21.943
with you. And of course, it wound up we did. And she 
just immediately fell in love with the community.

16:28.909 --> 16:38.078
She just didn't realize, not living here at the 
time, what was really available in the small

16:28.909 --> 16:38.078
community. There's a more cohesiveness. 
Merchants were more willing to help you. Banks

16:42.863 --> 16:44.805
were more willing to make that personal touch. And 
my daughter was just going into junior high. She

16:51.549 --> 16:55.296
immediately, sometime during that year, said, 
I'm going to Texas A&M. Well, you know, that hurt

16:57.059 --> 16:58.602
her. She'll change her mind many times before 
that, but she didn't. She never wavered. And she

17:02.448 --> 17:06.195
graduated last year. But that's how we came. Bill 
Wortham... insisted that I come down and I was very

17:09.895 --> 17:15.264
much intrigued with him, the department. I got to 
meet Dean Benson while I was here. I was very much

17:18.148 --> 17:24.719
impressed with him as an individual and I was just 
caught up in the potential that existed.

17:28.585 --> 17:32.832
And what was the position that you took when you 
came here? I had not had any teaching experience.

17:37.595 --> 17:45.185
They told me that I would have to start as an 
assistant professor, but that I would be promoted

17:37.595 --> 17:45.185
fairly quickly. That's what happened. But I came 
as an assistant professor in industrial

17:47.088 --> 17:56.481
engineering and as a researcher with the Texas 
Transportation Institute, a joint appointment,

17:47.088 --> 17:56.481
research and teaching. And you held that until you 
became department head? No, there's quite a bit of

18:01.482 --> 18:05.247
development and change in there. Of course, I was 
promoted to associate professor the second year.

18:12.617 --> 18:16.041
I think I served a system for up to two years. During 
the process of research at TTI, which is part of the

18:16.061 --> 18:30.240
engineering experiment station,

18:16.061 --> 18:30.240
I was able to sell the then directoratees of TTI, 
Jack Keyes, on the need to emphasize the driver in

18:30.997 --> 18:42.709
transportation research. TTI had built an image 
and an excellent reputation on what you might call

18:42.809 --> 18:51.258
the hardware, the cement, the bridges, the 
roadways, the things. But it never had a real

18:51.278 --> 18:57.344
emphasis on the driver as part of the 
transportation system. And due to my experience

18:57.364 --> 19:00.447
and interest, and sort of sold him on the idea. 
Sometimes,

19:04.637 --> 19:24.664
three years later, four years later, I'm not sure 
about the exact time, he, due to my somewhat

19:04.637 --> 19:24.664
success in developing research in that area, he 
developed a program, TTI, associated with the

19:04.637 --> 19:24.664
driver.

19:27.347 --> 19:29.590
I can't remember the name of the program. Highway 
Traffic Safety Programs. And I was the program

19:33.183 --> 19:36.708
manager. We started with about myself and about 
three people. And within two years, we were about

19:42.096 --> 19:50.468
30 people.

19:50.488 --> 19:56.016
And we then organized the division TTI set up with 
an umbrella

19:56.519 --> 20:06.709
over I think there were five divisions of 
research. One being highways and structures and

20:06.729 --> 20:10.834
bridges and so forth. And the sixth division was 
formed having to do with human factors and systems

20:10.854 --> 20:18.602
engineering. And I became the division head of 
that particular division. And it was Again, it was

20:25.780 --> 20:47.356
TTI's first

20:25.780 --> 20:47.356
emphasis in the area of research associated with 
the driver and the transportation element. That

20:47.376 --> 20:49.459
was actually when I developed my

20:53.017 --> 20:57.564
I guess the development of the research side of my 
personality, Texas A&M. In the meantime, the

20:58.445 --> 21:11.705
department was growing and there was the idea of 
trying to have a human factors engineering

20:58.445 --> 21:11.705
division in the department at the graduate level. 
That was organized somewhere during the time and I

21:11.725 --> 21:16.211
was made division in that.

21:19.376 --> 21:21.319
That sort of takes me up through at the time that 
there was a change. Actually, we had two changes in

21:26.617 --> 21:28.499
department heads. Bill Wortham stepped down and 
eventually left. Paul Newell was department head

21:34.608 --> 21:38.373
for, it seemed like, about three years. And when he 
stepped down, that's when I became department

21:39.395 --> 21:46.665
head. What was that? Seventy-five. Could you 
explain briefly? in layman's terms, what an

21:50.932 --> 21:57.260
industrial engineer does on the job?

21:57.280 --> 22:18.846
I'm not as competent, probably, in defining what 
industrial engineering does, per se, because my

21:57.280 --> 22:18.846
training and experience was in

21:57.280 --> 22:18.846
probably an auxiliary area of the field. But 
primarily industrial engineering is a

22:19.636 --> 22:42.784
technology that tries to optimize the 
relationships between

22:19.636 --> 22:42.784
the hardware that's necessary to produce a 
product and the person that's necessary to run the

22:19.636 --> 22:42.784
hardware that's to produce the product.

22:42.804 --> 22:45.627
An industrial engineer is a part of that. He's the 
engineer that facilitates the relationship

22:45.843 --> 22:58.685
between man, machine, and resources such that you 
can produce a product. Efficiency engineer is a

22:58.805 --> 23:05.657
type of industrial

22:58.805 --> 23:05.657
engineer. the quality control, the constant 
overview of the planning and the manufacturing

23:07.477 --> 23:19.670
process, the management engineer, all that fits 
the industrial engineering. How many faculty

23:19.710 --> 23:24.696
members do you have in the department?

23:24.716 --> 23:29.121
You mean the number of people in the classroom?

23:29.181 --> 23:32.124
Just under your supervision in this particular 
department? Well, again, that's In terms of the

23:36.603 --> 23:43.553
number of people it takes to teach our classes, we 
probably run close to 100. But in terms of

23:45.256 --> 23:51.505
full-time faculty that are assistant professors 
and above, I think we have 61. And we have to pull in

23:52.427 --> 23:55.351
people from other parts of the university. We use 
our own students just to teach the classes, do the

23:55.391 --> 23:59.337
size of the program.

24:02.287 --> 24:08.296
About how many students do you have enrolled for a 
degree in industrial engineering? Well, let me

24:08.316 --> 24:11.040
say something about industrial engineering. 
Industrial engineering is, I guess, is probably

24:11.060 --> 24:22.277
the only department in the university, if not the 
only.

24:22.397 --> 24:23.999
I can't think of any others like it. I think it's the 
only department that administers five different

24:24.019 --> 24:29.948
degree programs. This department administers 
the computer science program, the industrial

24:30.923 --> 24:43.782
engineering program, the bioengineering 
program, the safety engineering program, and the

24:30.923 --> 24:43.782
industrial hygiene program. Each one of those has 
its own set of faculty, its own set of students, but

24:43.802 --> 24:53.996
it's administered under the umbrella of one 
department, industrial engineering. Okay, now

24:55.218 --> 24:56.560
within that, on those total programs, there's 
just under 1,800

24:56.978 --> 25:05.591
students. 306 of those are graduate students. 
About 80 of those graduate students are Ph.D.

25:09.216 --> 25:17.509
students.

25:17.569 --> 25:21.996
How long had you been offering a Ph.D. degree in 
industrial engineering? That goes back before my

25:22.016 --> 25:26.142
time, so I really couldn't tell you that. must have 
been somewhere in the early 60s.

25:33.790 --> 25:53.091
The only degree program, the new degree program 
that's been instituted since I've been

25:33.790 --> 25:53.091
department head is the Bioengineering Master's 
and Ph.D. program and that must have been about 75

25:33.790 --> 25:53.091
and

25:33.790 --> 25:53.091
the safety engineering program, undergraduate 
and master's program, which is probably about two

25:53.965 --> 26:01.655
years old. Well, PhD in computer science began in 
1969. I don't know if there were some other ones

26:03.797 --> 26:06.541
before that. Yes, there were. The IE program is 
much older than that. I just don't know when it was.

26:12.789 --> 26:19.517
I would say that probably

26:12.789 --> 26:19.517
either the early 60s or maybe even the late 50s.

26:23.986 --> 26:34.901
Could you comment on the quality of the students 
enrolled in this

26:23.986 --> 26:34.901
department, particularly referring to the 
incoming students? Well, I think that as the

26:35.842 --> 26:48.921
statistics show, the quality of the incoming 
student has been improving over the last six or

26:35.842 --> 26:48.921
seven years of growth. We're getting a better 
student now. There's no doubt about that. We're

26:54.277 --> 27:01.332
not only getting more students, actually more 
than we can really handle, but we are getting a

26:54.277 --> 27:01.332
better student as well. I know the board 
yesterday, the past day, at least agreed to some

27:01.352 --> 27:13.078
kind of role in management policy that would 
upgrade the standards in terms of SAT scores for

27:13.666 --> 27:21.038
students before you finish your high school 
class. But even here, I'm not sure that's going to

27:21.859 --> 27:32.396
affect the growth in engineering that much 
because we've been getting a very, very good

27:21.859 --> 27:32.396
student the last few years anyway. That would seem 
to contradict the public perception of the news

27:32.416 --> 27:38.085
media that the quality of students is declining. 
Do you find that the case? Well, I can only say

27:42.944 --> 27:52.215
overall, all the statistics would show that there 
is, if you look at the reports on standardized test

27:42.944 --> 27:52.215
scores, there's some kind of decline nationwide. 
But if you compare what we're getting here, our SAT

27:52.915 --> 28:01.405
scores are above the standard. I'm not sure 
exactly what it is, but you can report it. The

28:04.308 --> 28:06.952
engineering people that I've interviewed here 
have concurred in that assessment. All the others

28:07.092 --> 28:10.015
have seen it, too. Do you have any figures on the 
number of women in the program of the 1,800

28:11.092 --> 28:15.578
students? Just an estimate.

28:23.409 --> 28:35.246
Other than the fact that we have the largest 
percentage of women in any of the industrial

28:23.409 --> 28:35.246
engineering departments, I honestly can't give 
you that estimate. Would you say it's under 10% or

28:35.266 --> 28:36.948
over? No, it's over. But under 20?

28:46.057 --> 28:49.260
I'd say that it's over 20. I think

28:49.280 --> 28:55.806
that the... I could look at that right quick. We 
just need a rough estimate. Maybe a four. I would

29:03.253 --> 29:06.416
say somewhere, yeah, I would say that. Probably 
25%. Okay, so industrial engineering attracts

29:07.157 --> 29:13.042
more women than the other fields of engineering. 
Yes. All right. Do you have any idea of why that

29:14.677 --> 29:18.842
might be the case? Well, again, included in this 
department are those technologies that relate

29:19.142 --> 29:29.013
more to the human element of engineering. Safety 
engineering, bioengineering, industrial

29:29.033 --> 29:33.478
engineering. Industrial engineering has 
always, in the past, been known as the management

29:33.498 --> 29:39.224
engineering field. As such, I really think that 
human element is what attracts more women Do you

29:45.710 --> 29:52.659
have any figures on the number of black steels that 
grow in this department?

29:53.680 --> 29:53.821
No. Again, we probably, percentage-wise, have 
more than the other departments,

29:53.841 --> 30:02.892
but we just don't have those figures. Is it under 
5%?

30:08.508 --> 30:09.710
Yes. Do you have any idea why relatively few blacks 
enroll in engineering here? This seems to be a

30:14.276 --> 30:17.460
situation throughout all the departments. Yeah, 
I think that the black student typically does not

30:18.101 --> 30:33.182
get introduced to some of the quantitative and 
physical sciences emphasis in the high schools.

30:36.520 --> 30:45.511
as typically

30:36.520 --> 30:45.511
the white student does. Engineering is a tougher 
curriculum. You don't quite have the background

30:46.753 --> 30:51.358
at the time to get into it. The failure rate's high, 
and there's less of a tendency to get involved in

30:52.780 --> 30:59.028
something that isn't high-productively 
failure. Do you have any statistics on what your

30:59.048 --> 31:04.114
dropout rate or attrition rate is in industrial 
engineering? I mean, what percent of the people

31:06.625 --> 31:14.176
who start the program never

31:06.625 --> 31:14.176
complete it? We're pretty much on the same

31:14.236 --> 31:23.369
college. I actually forgot what that is. I forgot 
what that percentage is. Did you get that from any

31:26.287 --> 31:28.370
of the other department heads? The other 
engineering department people have been saying

31:28.390 --> 31:33.276
that roughly half who began never complete. It's 
about a 50-50 situation. They're about as likely

31:35.039 --> 31:37.122
to finish as they're not. That's what the others 
have found. I think that's probably right. I think

31:42.129 --> 31:49.018
it probably is a little bit more than that, though, 
in that I'd say probably 60% finish. That's been

31:49.285 --> 31:54.274
steadily improving, or slightly improving over 
the last few years. At least the college has given

31:54.334 --> 31:56.357
us that data. What about the job prospects of 
people with bachelor's degrees in industrial

31:57.419 --> 32:03.910
engineering? It's never been better. What salary 
can they expect starting out with a bachelor's

32:07.176 --> 32:10.281
degree? Well, I would say you're talking about, 
again, there's a range here, depending if the

32:12.893 --> 32:37.703
person's had a co-op experience, in grades and 
things like that, but I would say that

32:12.893 --> 32:37.703
you're talking about a low end of the spectrum of 
probably $19,000 a year in the upper range of

32:12.893 --> 32:37.703
something like 23. This is last year's. Is it 
higher for a master's or a doctorate? Yes. How

32:46.614 --> 32:47.095
much? Oh, again, because a person with a master's 
degree will have other experience normally. But

32:54.405 --> 32:57.850
let's assume that there's just no experience 
that's gone straight through. There's no

32:58.050 --> 32:59.012
additional experience. You're talking about 
probably another $2,000 for a master's degree, an

33:01.544 --> 33:11.149
annual, and you're probably talking about maybe 
$5,000. What are some of the firms that hire

33:12.479 --> 33:19.371
industrial engineers?

33:19.391 --> 33:21.174
By name or by? If you could give us that, just to give 
an idea, because the average person probably

33:21.194 --> 33:28.026
doesn't have any idea where an industrial 
engineer works. Well, more recently, the oil

33:28.667 --> 33:38.183
companies have come in and been sort of purchasing 
the industrial engineer. planning and decision

33:38.163 --> 33:40.746
making purposes. But typically they have been all 
the manufacturing industries.

33:47.794 --> 33:51.319
Steel, metal cutting, aerospace.

33:56.545 --> 34:00.109
Again, mostly the manufacturing. Most of the 
graduates of the program have several job

34:00.149 --> 34:05.115
opportunities to pick from. I would say that 
typically you're talking about probably six to

34:05.720 --> 34:20.118
seven offers per student.

34:20.138 --> 34:30.090
Regarding the industrial engineering 
department, do you have any idea on how many

34:20.138 --> 34:30.090
universities across the nation offer programs in 
this field? Yeah, about 140. It's a lot of them. Do

34:35.389 --> 34:39.936
you have any idea on how the A&M program ranks 
others nationwide? Well, according to all the...

34:42.860 --> 34:54.017
There's several ranking

34:42.860 --> 34:54.017
sources in what's called the Dorman Report, which 
is one a lot of people look at. We rank 10th in the

34:54.778 --> 34:56.420
nation. In the... American Society of 
Engineering Education rankings, they rank you on

34:59.213 --> 35:13.671
several different categories in terms of faculty 
quality, amount of research, amount of

34:59.213 --> 35:13.671
resources. There's about five different places 
they rank you, and we're in the top five. Normally

35:19.919 --> 35:21.341
any one of those. Sometimes we're number one, 
sometimes we're always number five. We're

35:27.570 --> 35:31.376
typically in the top five in the way the ASEE ranks. 
What is ASEE? American Society of Engineering

35:32.578 --> 35:39.027
Education. Is the faculty considered your strong 
point in your

35:39.749 --> 35:45.437
program? Faculty and our research departments.

35:52.456 --> 35:58.404
Where are some of the schools that the faculty

35:52.456 --> 35:58.404
members are from? Well, Mr. Black, you name it. We 
have some from around our own area, the University

36:01.429 --> 36:11.543
of Texas, Arkansas, taking into account some of 
those numbers.

36:17.530 --> 36:39.567
Texas, outside Texas, we've got people from the 
University of Oklahoma, we've got people from

36:17.530 --> 36:39.567
Oklahoma State, we've got people from

36:17.530 --> 36:39.567
Purdue, University of Michigan,

36:17.530 --> 36:39.567
Penn State, University of Pittsburgh. You're 
teaching faculty members whole PhDs? All of what

36:43.349 --> 36:56.668
we consider our senior faculty members on the 
Ph.D. What are some of the weaknesses, if any, of

36:43.349 --> 36:56.668
the program? Well, at the current time, problems 
are associated with space and just to handle

36:56.688 --> 37:08.105
students. We have been teaching those. We're 
having to handle students put more students in

37:12.037 --> 37:24.892
laboratories

37:12.037 --> 37:24.892
than you've got facilities in. That damages the 
quality of your teaching. When you have to put more

37:28.896 --> 37:32.400
students in a classroom, a faculty member is 
accustomed to really handle the standpoint of

37:28.896 --> 37:32.400
trying to teach engineering. That's a problem. 
The last three years or so, we've faced situations

37:32.781 --> 37:38.247
where we just don't have enough classrooms, we 
don't have enough faculty.

37:42.648 --> 37:47.933
What about funding from the state legislature for 
industrial engineering? Is there enough, do you

37:48.394 --> 37:54.400
consider it funding to be adequate?

37:55.181 --> 38:03.008
In terms of, our funding from the legislature 
comes in two ways, faculty salaries and

37:55.181 --> 38:03.008
department operating money. The problems that 
we're experiencing now is that we stay two years

38:04.890 --> 38:09.735
behind the growth curve. We're funded on a 
biennial basis in the state so that money we're

38:09.968 --> 38:18.567
getting in any one time is basically behind. And if 
you're not in a growth mode, everything's fine.

38:23.477 --> 38:26.644
And I would say that we're happy to fund it. But in 
these periods of growth where we've been saved by

38:26.962 --> 38:38.779
hand, our funds have not been, we have not been 
added to the funding in terms of the growth, in

38:26.962 --> 38:38.779
terms of the way the budget operates in the state. 
Do you have any figures on what your department

38:38.799 --> 38:41.703
budget is for this year?

38:45.068 --> 38:46.029
Yeah, I do. I can't add

38:46.049 --> 38:52.138
that to the plan. Okay. Okay. Actually, the reason 
I can't say that because I don't, they really don't

38:52.865 --> 38:57.249
pass the budget. Well, for the past year. Well, the 
past year, yes. In terms of our academic money, we

38:59.872 --> 39:08.260
had, in the Department of Law, we had $1.8 million. 
Okay. What about sources of funding for research

39:08.400 --> 39:12.944
programs? What's the sources of those? We run, for 
the past five years, have been one of the major...

39:22.480 --> 39:28.113
departments of economy and engineering in terms 
of research, dollar volume produced. We run about

39:28.795 --> 39:32.644
2 million a year. And our sources are fairly well 
divided in terms of state sources and federal

39:32.664 --> 39:39.139
sources. And then I would say that one's about 40%, 
40%, and

39:40.503 --> 40:01.731
there's about 20% that we've picked up local 
industry, or industry sources. One of those

40:01.751 --> 40:06.898
specific examples of industry, we have been 
funded by General Dynamics, LTV, and some smaller

40:08.347 --> 40:15.663
manufacturing

40:08.347 --> 40:15.663
companies. I can't recall the names now. From a 
state standpoint, we have been funded for

40:16.284 --> 40:21.495
research by cities. El Paso, Arlington, some of 
our major contributors. We've developed the

40:28.368 --> 40:32.113
software systems for them. From the standpoint 
of, we've also received the funds from some of

40:32.133 --> 40:41.326
the state agencies. One of the governor's 
offices. We've received some research from Texas

40:43.128 --> 40:47.955
Education Agency. Going to the federal level, we 
receive funds from the National Science

40:48.914 --> 41:03.111
Foundation, Department of Defense,

40:48.914 --> 41:03.111
Department of Energy. That's sort of what's 
matter.

41:07.076 --> 41:15.926
Could you discuss, Dr. Ellis, specifically some 
of the research endeavors that are now underway or

41:07.076 --> 41:15.926
that have recently been completed? Well, I'll 
probably touch on the ones that are or most

41:19.289 --> 41:26.422
interesting, which we have probably made a name 
for ourselves nationally and internationally.

41:26.462 --> 41:37.703
And that is in the, and that is an ongoing research 
program that started about five years ago and will

41:26.462 --> 41:37.703
be continuing the next five years, I believe. It's 
an area in which we have some of my faculty applying

41:38.746 --> 41:49.937
engineering techniques to try to understand 
food-bearing plants. The idea is that we can apply

41:51.278 --> 42:08.314
engineering techniques to understand and model 
and describe how a plant that bears food actually

41:51.278 --> 42:08.314
operates given the conditions in which it exists, 
whether it's water, sunlight, how it uses

41:51.278 --> 42:08.314
nutrients, and so forth. We feel like then we can 
tell the person in the agricultural field how to

42:08.294 --> 42:21.031
optimize or increase food production. It's a 
rather unique, ingenious approach that says I can

42:21.131 --> 42:28.882
look at a plant, a food plant, just like I look at a 
manufacturing facility. If I can describe it

42:28.902 --> 42:37.373
mathematically well enough, then I can tell you 
what you need to change to make that plant produce

42:28.902 --> 42:37.373
better. And it has caught the attention of people 
at the national and international level. We have

42:48.935 --> 42:50.898
several faculty. There's no food conference 
given even internationally. Some of our faculty

42:53.582 --> 43:00.171
are not always invited

42:53.582 --> 43:00.171
to give presentations and so forth. That's 
probably the area in which, well, one other area

43:01.906 --> 43:14.343
also connected to engineering applied to 
problems that you may not think that they would be

43:01.906 --> 43:14.343
applied to. And also using the techniques to model 
the growth and spread of insects that are damaging

43:14.364 --> 43:22.114
the crops. Ways to detect them. how

43:26.071 --> 43:47.083
to sample

43:26.071 --> 43:47.083
them to describe their spread, and

43:26.071 --> 43:47.083
then how to optimize the use of pesticides to stop 
the spread. I guess the major

43:47.103 --> 43:52.170
project being in the Pine Parkville area. The 
insect is quite damaging to the pine and lumber

43:52.190 --> 43:53.412
industry. That's an area in which we have made 
quite an impact. Now, outside of that, we have the

43:58.064 --> 44:05.012
typical areas that we normally do research in. We 
do part of the research and manufacturing area. We

44:07.034 --> 44:19.467
have a person that recently developed a 
computerized model for describing and

44:07.034 --> 44:19.467
understanding the modular manufacturing 
process. It has been introduced and being used by

44:20.662 --> 44:27.111
several industries.

44:27.131 --> 44:32.679
We cooperate with Texas Transportation 
Institute in the study of the driver. One of our

44:32.699 --> 44:48.542
faculty has been involved in the 
state-of-the-art study of providing a real-time

44:32.699 --> 44:48.542
information display system to the highway, 
interstate

44:32.699 --> 44:48.542
highway. Those are

44:49.163 --> 45:04.465
the three major projects that have gone on and are 
still going on right now. There's a multiplicity

45:04.485 --> 45:08.912
of smaller ones. Are these projects done by 
faculty members and graduate students? Yes sir.

45:15.141 --> 45:16.723
Where do they conduct their research? Well, if 
it's the modeling research, this is sort of a

45:18.644 --> 45:27.332
paper-pencil-computer approach with field 
data. Some of the field data is collected in

45:28.874 --> 45:34.399
cooperation with the College of Agriculture. 
This is engineering agriculture studies. And

45:36.281 --> 45:42.727
some of the field data is collected right now on 
people's farms, meadows, and so forth. Tele-type

45:42.747 --> 45:48.212
back into the

45:42.747 --> 45:48.212
computer communications. Obviously

45:49.036 --> 46:07.569
the highway type stuff is done with TTI facilities 
either out of the annex, but some of the facilities

45:49.036 --> 46:07.569
are in the actual context of the roadway, Houston, 
Dallas,

45:49.036 --> 46:07.569
and so forth. How many of your faculty members have 
joint appointments through TTI in addition to

46:07.629 --> 46:11.837
being on the teaching faculty?

46:17.470 --> 46:33.014
Well, this will vary as a function of research 
needs at TTI, but any given semester we'll

46:17.470 --> 46:33.014
probably

46:17.470 --> 46:33.014
be sharing about three faculty at TTI. Let me 
switch the tape just a second.

46:37.923 --> 46:46.251
The last thing I want to ask you about is the changes 
that you've seen here since you were a student in

46:37.923 --> 46:46.251
the early 50s and since you came in 69 up to this 
time. So just a broad change that you've seen.
