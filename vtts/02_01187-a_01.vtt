WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:05.377
So let's see if this works better than Mars 
Observer. Okay, this is Ron Sharn interviewing

00:07.059 --> 00:13.947
Dale Cruikshank, older Colorado, October 19, 
1993.

00:16.410 --> 00:20.715
Dale, for the record, would you please give your 
full name? Yes, I am Dale Paul Cruikshank. And when

00:24.339 --> 00:25.721
and where were you born? I was born in Des Moines, 
Iowa, 1939, August 10th. When did you get

00:29.705 --> 00:31.067
interested in astronomy? I got interested in 
astronomy when I was about 12 or 13 years old. The

00:38.242 --> 00:49.092
first astronomical event of my life was the total 
eclipse of the sun of June 30, 1954, at which time I

00:38.242 --> 00:49.092
was 13 years old, I think. And my mother took me and a 
school friend to northern Michigan to see the

00:50.073 --> 00:56.299
totality phase. And it was a success. And from then 
on, it was clear that I had to be an astronomer.

01:02.114 --> 01:03.578
Where did you go to undergraduate school? I was an 
undergraduate physics major at Iowa State

01:03.778 --> 01:07.929
University in Ames. I graduated from there in 1961 
and went from there then to the University of

01:08.731 --> 01:18.537
Arizona where I was a graduate student I got a 
master's degree in planetary geology in 1966, I

01:19.732 --> 01:34.232
believe it was, and finished a PhD in 1968, also in 
the geology department with an emphasis on

01:19.732 --> 01:34.232
planetary geology. So what were you doing at 
Yerkes in the summer of 1959? When I was midway

01:37.917 --> 01:45.047
through my freshman year at Iowa State, I already 
started thinking about graduate school. and

01:45.517 --> 01:49.904
began to write to various schools that had 
astronomy programs. And one of those schools, of

01:50.525 --> 01:53.149
course, was the University of Chicago. And I got a 
very nice letter back answering the questions I

01:53.990 --> 02:05.507
had asked and telling me about a summer program 
that was held at Yerkes Observatory for

01:53.990 --> 02:05.507
undergraduates and inviting me to apply for that. 
I did apply and was told that the program was really

02:06.188 --> 02:13.920
for more advanced undergraduates than someone 
who was just finishing her freshman year. but that

02:14.491 --> 02:19.897
if I could provide a suitable letter of 
recommendation, they would consider my

02:14.491 --> 02:19.897
application. So this was correspondence with Joe 
Chamberlain, who at the time was the chairman of

02:20.738 --> 02:27.086
the student admission program, I think. So I 
managed to get a letter of recommendation from

02:27.626 --> 02:41.022
Philip Riggs, who was the astronomer at the Drake 
University and operated the Drake Municipal

02:27.626 --> 02:41.022
Observatory, and with whom I'd become friends 
because I lived in Des Moines. And so Riggs sent a

02:41.980 --> 02:48.109
letter of recommendation that was accepted by 
Chamberlain and the committee, and I was offered

02:41.980 --> 02:48.109
the summer job. So I showed up at Yerkes in the early 
summer of 1958.

02:57.022 --> 02:58.504
What did you do there? The first summer, I worked in 
the darkroom on Kuiper's Lunar Atlas project, at

02:58.524 --> 03:08.899
which time he was assembling the photographs from 
ground-based telescopes around the world, the

03:09.757 --> 03:21.871
best lunar photographs to assemble into the lunar 
atlas that was supported by the U.S. Air Force. And

03:22.773 --> 03:33.565
I remember I'd had a lot of experience with 
darkroom work just as an amateur photographer, so

03:22.773 --> 03:33.565
it was pretty easy to fit into that role, and I 
enjoyed it a lot. I remember the thrill on one

03:33.626 --> 03:39.072
afternoon when Kuiper came around to the darkroom 
shortly after I had arrived and introduced

03:39.457 --> 03:49.846
himself and saw what I was doing and came in and was 
helping me produce a couple of prints from some of

03:39.457 --> 03:49.846
these lunar negatives. And there we stood side by 
side with our hands in the developer tank rubbing

03:50.567 --> 04:01.516
on one of these prints to try to increase the 
development in a place that needed a little bit of

03:50.567 --> 04:01.516
extra help. And it was a real thrill because I had 
known Kuiper's name, of course, from reading the

04:01.536 --> 04:06.921
textbooks and so on. And there we were in the 
darkroom rubbing prints together. We'll get back

04:10.220 --> 04:14.365
to him in a while, but now you got your PhD in what 
year? 1968. Okay, where did you go from there? I

04:18.450 --> 04:23.015
went pretty much directly to Moscow from there. I 
had been interested in Russia, Russian language,

04:24.277 --> 04:35.070
Russian culture, the Russian science program 
since undergraduate days when I started to study

04:24.277 --> 04:35.070
the language. And Kuiper was interested in it too. 
He had I, of course, spent my graduate years with

04:38.401 --> 04:41.544
him there in Tucson. And he had developed contacts 
with the Soviet Union in terms of its lunar and

04:42.465 --> 04:50.013
planetary exploration program. And I asked him to 
help me try to get one of the National Academy of

04:50.814 --> 04:59.763
Sciences exchange appointments to the Soviet 
Union. The exchange program was fairly quiet but

05:00.744 --> 05:04.148
reasonably active at the time. And he helped, and I 
got one of the appointments. Um, shortly after I

05:08.557 --> 05:20.312
got my degree, uh, within a couple of months, I took 
off for Moscow, spent a better part of a year there

05:08.557 --> 05:20.312
and returned to Tucson in the summer of 1969. What 
did you do aside from hearing me over the radio in

05:21.553 --> 05:26.439
the caucuses one time? Yes. What did you do at, in 
Moscow? Um, the reason that it made sense to go

05:29.743 --> 05:37.753
there in the first place is that Vasily Moroz, uh, 
was a planetary astronomer. working in the near

05:38.105 --> 05:49.261
infrared with equipment very comparable in 
quality to what Kuiper had in Tucson and the

05:38.105 --> 05:49.261
equipment that I had used under Kuiper's 
direction in Tucson. So it made sense to go there

05:49.762 --> 05:55.310
and find out what Moroz was doing to work with him on 
planetary problems and so on. He received me in

05:56.512 --> 06:02.140
Moscow, and we did, in fact, work together. We 
observed together in the Crimea, wrote a couple of

06:02.180 --> 06:05.665
papers, And it was, in general, quite an 
adventure. So it was an opportunity to spend 10 or

06:09.005 --> 06:23.894
11 months with the Russian counterpart of 
Kuiper's program to assess what they were doing,

06:09.005 --> 06:23.894
to actually make a few interesting observations, 
write a couple of papers. Where'd you go from

06:23.935 --> 06:24.656
there? I went back to Tucson in the summer of 69. and 
spent almost, well, essentially a year there as

06:28.595 --> 06:36.105
Kuiper's associate. It was clear, however, that I 
would always be cast in the role of a former

06:36.665 --> 06:49.482
student, and Kuiper and I had a couple of tussles 
over scientific issues during that year's time. I

06:50.564 --> 06:55.530
was talking at the same time with the people in 
Hawaii, namely Bob Murphy, who is now at NASA

06:56.168 --> 07:04.638
headquarters, David Morrison, and with Bill 
Sinton and John Jeffries at the University of

06:56.168 --> 07:04.638
Hawaii about a possible position there. And they 
offered one. I originally turned it down. And then

07:08.463 --> 07:13.489
when things got tight with Kuiper again, it looked 
like it'd be appropriate to accept it. I did. And

07:14.209 --> 07:21.058
then in either late June or early July, I took off 
for Hawaii and stayed there for the better part of

07:14.209 --> 07:21.058
18 years. OK. What did you do at Hawaii? Hawaii was, 
in the summer of 1970, putting the finishing

07:24.974 --> 07:35.847
touches on the 2.2-meter telescope that the NASA 
Planetary Program had funded. NASA built the

07:36.808 --> 07:39.792
telescope roughly at a cost of $3 million. The 
state of Hawaii provided the building and

07:40.673 --> 07:44.578
infrastructure roughly for a cost of $2 million. 
This was one, of course, of the several NASA

07:45.319 --> 07:50.485
telescopes that were built during that era. And 
they were trying to build a... a program of

07:54.421 --> 07:59.808
ground-based astronomy, nighttime 
ground-based astronomy, because they already

07:54.421 --> 07:59.808
had a solar program. And we're building staff. 
We're finishing up this telescope and so on. So it

08:03.753 --> 08:18.231
was an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of 
the exploitation and development of Mauna Kea as a

08:03.753 --> 08:18.231
ground-based observing site, which turned out, 
of course, later to be world-class quality. So I

08:20.313 --> 08:23.938
went to Hawaii on a research position. with no 
teaching obligations, and it was one of those very

08:24.712 --> 08:40.451
rare opportunities to move into an academic 
setting with all of the best of the opportunities

08:24.712 --> 08:40.451
and very little of the liabilities. What did you 
work on? I began working immediately on planetary

08:41.532 --> 08:45.257
problems. The 2.2-meter telescope had a large 
Coudet spectrograph, which was available

08:45.777 --> 08:53.166
essentially as the telescope was commissioned. 
And I began doing high dispersion coude

08:53.585 --> 08:59.494
spectroscopy, photographic spectroscopy. And I 
remember the first problem I worked on was ammonia

08:59.514 --> 09:02.619
on Saturn. There was not, at that time, a positive 
detection of ammonia on Saturn, although it was

09:03.380 --> 09:08.408
obvious on Jupiter. Although it was in some 
textbooks, but it was wrong. That's right, yes. So

09:13.316 --> 09:21.769
I used,

09:13.316 --> 09:21.769
I think not the highest, but next highest 
dispersion spectrograph with about two

09:13.316 --> 09:21.769
angstroms per millimeter. photographic looking 
for the 6450 band of ammonia on Saturn, and I

09:22.407 --> 09:32.843
couldn't find it with what I thought was a rather 
high sensitivity limit. So I published an

09:33.464 --> 09:37.891
abstract and presented that at a DPS meeting, I 
think in 1971. I believe, I'm not certain, but I

09:39.153 --> 09:46.845
believe that my abstract was the first published 
scientific result from the 88-inch or 2.2-meter

09:39.153 --> 09:46.845
telescope. I've never made a point of that to my 
Hawaii colleagues, but for what it's worth, I

09:47.332 --> 09:53.120
think that is, in fact, true. Where did you go after 
Hawaii? Well, of course, Hawaii was an experience

09:56.866 --> 10:06.439
that ran nearly 18 years, and so I'd really 
developed almost all of my professional career

09:56.866 --> 10:06.439
during that period. I left Hawaii... After 17 and a 
half years. In what year? I believe late 87 and

10:13.830 --> 10:21.545
began a position at NASA Ames Research Center in 
California in January of 88. Why the switch? I made

10:23.328 --> 10:28.358
the switch primarily because my family and I were 
tired of living in Hawaii. And it was, in fact, that

10:28.928 --> 10:36.196
personal decision that motivated us to consider 
leaving the islands. Hawaii had tremendous

10:37.177 --> 10:42.083
professional opportunities and advantages. And 
I was not in the slightest dissatisfied with those

10:42.864 --> 10:50.612
professional aspects of the situation. The 
Institute for Astronomy during that 17 and a half

10:51.473 --> 10:55.678
years certainly did change. But I was very much a 
part of it. I was made to feel extremely welcome and

10:58.380 --> 11:02.544
valued there. Yet, based on my family's personal 
desire to return to mainland United States, we

11:03.285 --> 11:13.214
decided to leave Hawaii. And the opportunity for a 
position at NASA Ames arose largely through the

11:13.394 --> 11:23.623
help of Michael Werner, and James Pollock at NASA 
Ames, both of whom wanted me there. And so they made

11:29.334 --> 11:30.856
an opportunity, and we took it. Are you still 
there? I'm still at NASA Ames. It's coming up on six

11:33.879 --> 11:34.980
years. What are you doing, or what have you done? 
I'm continuing the very kind of thing I was doing in

11:37.243 --> 11:46.093
Hawaii, specifically spectroscopy in the 
infrared and near-infrared of planetary

11:37.243 --> 11:46.093
objects. And during the time since I started that 
business in the early 60s, which has now been

11:53.725 --> 11:55.007
almost exactly 30 years. Enormous advances have 
been made in the technology of infrared

11:56.890 --> 12:21.387
observations at all wavelengths and it's a real 
pleasure and a thrill to still ride on the crest of

11:56.890 --> 12:21.387
that wave as we continue to open up new levels of 
sensitivity and brightness and difficulty in

11:56.890 --> 12:21.387
looking at the infrared spectral signatures of 
small, distant, faint, cold solar system bodies.

12:28.155 --> 12:30.417
Isn't it nice not to have to ammoniate plates 
anymore? It's nice not to have to ammoniate

12:30.478 --> 12:33.721
plates, and I did a fair amount of that, too. I still 
got scars from some of that, but that's another

12:34.621 --> 12:37.304
story. You're the obvious person to ask this. 
While this project that I'm doing is subtitled

12:40.907 --> 12:48.775
NASA and the Rebirth of Planetary Astronomy, I do 
want to mention some other stuff now. The former

12:51.072 --> 12:58.360
Soviet Union had a huge program in science and 
everything, and a huge space program and so forth.

12:59.341 --> 13:15.218
But as Gerard de Bacallure said, they'd take a 
telescope this small, holding his fingers a

12:59.341 --> 13:15.218
centimeter apart, and get an image this small, 
holding his fingers a millimeter apart, take an

12:59.341 --> 13:15.218
equation this long, holding his hands a yard 
apart, And get a wrong result. Now, it seems to me

13:17.578 --> 13:24.645
they had the highest ratio of effort to results 
that I've ever heard of in any field of science.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.126
What's your view about that? Is that true? And if 
so, why? Well, let me try to answer that with a

13:28.588 --> 13:36.595
specific focus on the near infrared, which is my 
primary area of expertise. As I indicated before,

13:37.176 --> 13:45.103
I went to Moscow in the first place because Moroz 
had a detector and a spectrometer comparable to

13:37.176 --> 13:45.103
what Kuiper had. And this involved a lead sulfide 
single element detector that was attached to a

13:45.792 --> 14:02.210
spectrometer working in the lead sulfide region, 
that is, lead sulfide cooled with dry ice or

13:45.792 --> 14:02.210
nitrogen and operating out to about two and a half 
or three microns. Now, I'm told that the way the

14:02.810 --> 14:14.483
Russians got that lead sulfide detector is that in 
earlier years when the Russians were friends with

14:02.810 --> 14:14.483
the Chinese, that the Chinese had come upon an 
American rocket with a heat-seeking guidance

14:14.767 --> 14:19.492
system. And that heat-seeking, this was probably 
aftermath of the Korean conflict, maybe during

14:19.512 --> 14:25.539
the Korean conflict. But anyway, the Chinese gave 
this rocket sensing device to the Russians, their

14:25.619 --> 14:31.807
friends. The Russians took it apart, discovered 
that it was a lead sulfide detector, and proceeded

14:32.387 --> 14:40.977
to analyze it in such a way that they could make one 
themselves. An entire institute of probably

14:41.378 --> 14:45.544
greater than 100 people was assigned this task. 
And they, in fact, did make lead sulfide detectors

14:46.325 --> 14:51.453
of comparable quality. A couple of these found 
their way into the hands of scientists, in

14:52.094 --> 14:56.821
particular. And he was able to exploit it for 
scientific use. As I'm told this story, this

15:02.830 --> 15:07.757
particular science institute was this was 
essentially their only task, was to deal with this

15:08.142 --> 15:12.206
one detector system. And after several years of 
working, continuing on it, they got so entrenched

15:12.906 --> 15:24.217
and ingrown and inbred that they even lost the 
technique themselves. And after they had had this

15:24.777 --> 15:28.721
initial success, they couldn't do it anymore. Yet 
the Institute and all the personnel stayed intact

15:28.961 --> 15:35.247
and proceeded down their merry way because 
apparently nobody called them off. and told them

15:35.513 --> 15:37.917
to go do something else. So that was apparently the 
apex, the culmination of Russian near-infrared

15:37.937 --> 15:48.092
detector development. And to my understanding, 
it never got any better. And they were never able,

15:51.537 --> 16:00.531
after that initial success, to keep up with 
Western achievements, Western developments in

15:51.537 --> 16:00.531
detector development. Let's go back to GPK now. He 
was on the Project Alsos mission, which everyone

16:04.184 --> 16:13.955
always confuses with Operation Paperclip, but 
Alsos went in with the combat troops sometimes

16:04.184 --> 16:13.955
ahead of them. And that's where I understand that 
GPK picked up the infrared technology that he

16:15.017 --> 16:20.122
used. Well, I think that's not entirely correct. 
It's related. Kuiper was working on Alsos to

16:24.047 --> 16:28.352
evaluate German technological achievements and 
developments and so on. And that story is very

16:32.992 --> 16:38.718
nicely told in David Dvorkin's book, by the way, 
the 1992 book. Which is entitled? I've forgotten.

16:41.341 --> 16:44.243
It's something about the German vengeance weapon 
or something of the kind. It's an excellent book

16:44.263 --> 16:49.649
and a very nice little piece, well referenced 
about Kuiper's involvement with Alsace. In any

16:50.149 --> 16:58.778
case, Kuiper's academic colleague, Robert 
Cashman, in the United States, was the American

16:50.149 --> 16:58.778
developer of of the lead sulfide detectors. And 
Cashman worked with Kuiper or vice versa to

17:01.803 --> 17:19.840
produce one of these things after they were 
declassified, just following the war, to produce

17:01.803 --> 17:19.840
one of these things for use in an astronomical 
spectrometer at the McDonald Observatory. What

17:21.722 --> 17:27.988
Kuiper learned about German detector 
development, I don't know in detail, but I think he

17:21.722 --> 17:27.988
found that they were close on the heels or perhaps 
even a little bit better at these near-infrared

17:28.373 --> 17:34.662
detectors than the Americans were. The details of 
that I'm not certain about. But the upshot of it in

17:37.025 --> 17:50.324
terms of his ability to have a detector and begin 
this pioneering work in near-infrared

17:37.025 --> 17:50.324
spectroscopy, both in stellar and planetary 
work, came from his association with Cashman. And

17:51.165 --> 17:53.368
Cashman's A brief obituary of Cashman appeared 
not long ago in Physics Today, where there's a

17:53.956 --> 18:02.807
brief assessment of his work on these 
near-infrared detectors. The association with

18:04.689 --> 18:14.060
Cashman, as I say, produced a detector, one of 
which, by the way, is now in the collection at the

18:04.689 --> 18:14.060
National Air and Space Museum. I managed to 
salvage this from Kuiper's collection of

18:14.661 --> 18:23.271
memorabilia, and it was donated to the museum a 
couple of years ago. So they have it, one of the very

18:23.993 --> 18:28.417
ones that was used in the original spectrometer 
that Kuiper used. Now, Kuiper was, and I know this

18:29.499 --> 18:39.188
because I funded him when I was at headquarters, 
was the guy that first realized what a great site

18:29.499 --> 18:39.188
Mauna Kea was. But he got frozen out of it. What do 
you know about that? The story of Kuiper's

18:45.715 --> 18:53.022
association with Mauna Kea is rather accurately 
told in the two lengthy editorials by Mitch

18:53.305 --> 19:00.131
Waldrop in Science, and these appeared roughly 10 
years ago. I can't remember exactly. It's a

19:01.913 --> 19:03.134
complex story. Some of the details, I think, are 
forever obscure because they relate to Kuiper's

19:04.396 --> 19:09.520
feelings about it. Essentially, Kuiper 
recognized the potential of Mauna Kea, dealt

19:10.541 --> 19:19.650
directly with the governor of the state of Hawaii, 
John Burns, who received him very well and who

19:20.086 --> 19:26.576
supported the initial site surveys at Mauna Kea. 
At the same time, however, the University of

19:26.596 --> 19:39.797
Hawaii was trying to build a program in astronomy, 
primarily in solar astronomy, as a follow-on to

19:26.596 --> 19:39.797
the International Geophysical Year, which had 
taken place in 1957-58. There was work on aurora

19:40.739 --> 19:46.768
and, again, on the sun done on Haleakala, And this 
work was done through the University of Hawaii.

19:51.346 --> 19:59.835
Well, they hired a solar astronomer, John T. 
Jeffries, who brought with him an entourage of

19:51.346 --> 19:59.835
solar physicists from Boulder, Colorado. And 
they began this program of solar work. Well, they

20:02.939 --> 20:16.114
decided, while Kuiper was busily working with the 
governor of Hawaii to assess the qualities of

20:02.939 --> 20:16.114
Mauna Kea for nighttime astronomy, NASA 
solicited proposals for a major optical

20:16.330 --> 20:20.055
telescope on Mauna Kea. Kuiper, with the 
assistance of Harold Johnson, also in Tucson,

20:20.596 --> 20:26.203
naturally put in a proposal to do this. But NASA 
didn't want a single proposal because it was

20:27.064 --> 20:32.011
clearly non-competitive. So they solicited 
proposals from other agencies or other

20:32.391 --> 20:43.806
universities and were given proposals by Harvard 
University and also by the University of Hawaii.

20:44.528 --> 20:55.163
John Jeffries, sort of on last minute, put 
together this proposal to go in in parallel with

20:44.528 --> 20:55.163
Kuiper's proposal to NASA for a telescope there. 
After these proposals were evaluated, the choice

20:56.485 --> 21:02.273
was made to go with the University of Hawaii. And 
William Brunk tells me, who was in the driver's

21:02.873 --> 21:12.747
seat at that time, that they at NASA headquarters 
felt that Kuiper was overextended. He had too many

21:13.233 --> 21:26.312
irons in the fire at various places around the 
world, and they felt that John Jeffries and his

21:13.233 --> 21:26.312
solar crew, while more or less unproven for 
nighttime astronomy, should be given the

21:13.233 --> 21:26.312
opportunity to do it. They were on the site, they 
were there, and should be given the opportunity,

21:26.432 --> 21:33.422
Kuiper being overextended. The Harvard 
proposal, apparently, was not very competitive.

21:36.306 --> 21:37.287
That was Menzel's. That's right. I'll tell you, 
since I'm writing a book, I can say anything I want.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.801
Brunk was new. He never did have any track record as 
a scientist. Nancy Roman told me personally

21:50.227 --> 21:59.736
before I left headquarters that Kuiper would have 
a telescope on Mauna Kea over her dead body.

22:01.998 --> 22:05.301
Nancy Roman's involvement is an element that I 
really don't know anything about. Let me ask you

22:05.801 --> 22:08.203
something on a related matter. Kuiper left the 
directorship of Yerkes and McDonald rather

22:10.422 --> 22:13.425
suddenly. And in fact,

22:14.506 --> 22:29.721
Frank Edmondson keeps telling me, although I've 
never seen any proof, that he says he's got

22:14.506 --> 22:29.721
documentary proof that Kuiper was summarily 
fired as director of Yerkes and McDonald. What do

22:29.741 --> 22:31.483
you know about that? I would have to refer to my 
notes on that. I've been in touch with Frank

22:33.305 --> 22:38.590
Edmondson about this and with various other 
people as well. As I was putting together the

22:38.924 --> 22:57.833
manuscript for my biographical memoir on Kuiper 
that will soon be published by the National

22:38.924 --> 22:57.833
Academy, I was fully convinced that this 
assertion is true and that Kuiper was forced to

22:38.924 --> 22:57.833
step down. And I would have to refer to my notes and 
sources to recall the exact circumstances. on

23:04.422 --> 23:10.909
that, and I have agreed already to provide that to 
you, Ron, so that you can consider that. You're on

23:10.929 --> 23:11.910
the record now. Sure. Fair enough. Let me ask you a 
personal question. Because G.P.K. obviously is a

23:17.175 --> 23:23.982
key player in the rebirth of planetary astronomy, 
and I can't interview him. What was he like? Kuiper

23:25.764 --> 23:33.872
was a very intense personality, a very imposing 
figure physically, and an absolutely

23:34.612 --> 23:39.377
domineering character intellectually. He had a 
profound effect on my life, certainly at the

23:40.839 --> 23:50.670
professional level, but as the years go by, I see he 
had a profound effect on my life in a personal

23:40.839 --> 23:50.670
sense, too. There are other people upon whose 
lives he has had similar profound influences, and

23:51.551 --> 23:57.598
Tom Geralds is one such. Tom Geralds and I have, 
over the last many years, talked a lot, written a

24:02.050 --> 24:12.620
lot to one another, trying to come to grips, to 
reach peace with this effect that Kuyper has had on

24:02.050 --> 24:12.620
both of our lives. Gerholtz, of course, is a fellow 
Dutchman. In any case, and dealt with Kuyper

24:16.423 --> 24:30.977
primarily earlier on, in any event, Kuyper was a

24:16.423 --> 24:30.977
domineering individual whose intellect one 
could only respect and One evidence of that is that

24:31.598 --> 24:37.508
even essentially everyone who worked with him 
called him Dr. Kuiper. He was Gerard only to a very,

24:38.009 --> 24:45.242
very small inner circle of people who were 
essentially his contemporaries. Fred Whipple.

24:46.364 --> 24:53.397
Fred Whipple and Harold Johnson and Frank Lowe and 
those folks were able to call him Gerard, which, by

24:46.364 --> 24:53.397
the way, wasn't his real name. That's an 
Americanized version of Garrett. which was his

24:56.793 --> 24:59.558
Dutch given name. In any case, he, on the one hand, 
was a marvelous conversationalist, had a very

25:00.159 --> 25:14.102
nice sense of humor, and was a joy to be around in 
many respects. He was extremely impatient, on the

25:14.703 --> 25:21.535
other hand, with anybody who appeared to be 
intellectually inferior to him. to have less

25:22.190 --> 25:27.598
knowledge than him and so on, he didn't deal with 
students very well. He was very difficult to work

25:28.119 --> 25:31.104
with and to work for. His general demeanor was one 
of extreme arrogance, and it took a lot to get past

25:33.407 --> 25:46.848
that, to be able to work with him, to be able to stand 
him. But once you did, there was a lot to be derived

25:49.223 --> 25:55.250
from the association, a lot of positive things to 
be derived from the association. And for those of

25:56.331 --> 26:06.362
us who were able to get on top of that demeanor 
issue, we derived a lot of benefit from the

25:56.331 --> 26:06.362
association. Joe Chamberlain said something 
about the Quake. He said he was a very loyal man. And

26:12.649 --> 26:14.370
I mentioned that to Fred Whipple. And he agreed. He 
said, yes, he certainly was perhaps too loyal in

26:15.672 --> 26:18.555
some cases. But he said Gerard's main problem was 
he couldn't get along with people. That's right.

26:24.550 --> 26:25.251
That's quite right. And I think that that showed up 
when Kuiper arrived in America around 1929 or 1930

26:25.512 --> 26:43.739
and went to the Lick Observatory as a postdoc, 
later to become a Kellogg Fellow at the Lick

26:25.512 --> 26:43.739
Observatory. I mentioned earlier Philip Riggs, 
who was the astronomer in Des Moines where I grew

26:44.180 --> 26:48.306
up. Philip Riggs was a graduate student at Lick 
Observatory when Kuyper arrived as a fresh

26:49.163 --> 26:54.991
postdoc from Holland. When I told, after I spent 
the first summer at Yerkes Observatory, these now

26:56.012 --> 27:12.734
in 1958, and went back to Des Moines and talked to 
Philip Riggs, who had recommended me for the job,

26:56.012 --> 27:12.734
the first thing he asked me was, has old Gerard 
Kuyper learned to get along with anybody yet? And

27:13.575 --> 27:18.141
that told me right then and there that this problem 
had arisen And this element of Kuiper's

27:18.442 --> 27:22.729
personality showed up from day one. By the way, 
Phil Riggs spent a summer at the University of

27:22.749 --> 27:25.914
Illinois. I was his teaching assistant. Oh, is 
that right? That's great. He's a wonderful man.

27:30.561 --> 27:35.308
Now, let me connect Kuiper with going back now to 
the history of planetary astronomy.

27:38.233 --> 27:44.803
When you started, did you feel inferior to real 
astronomers who worked on stars and galaxies?

27:45.796 --> 27:48.400
Well, in a way, yes, and in a way, no. As I've already 
mentioned, I got my first acquaintance with real

27:48.740 --> 27:56.110
professional astronomers at Yerkes 
Observatory. And this was an extraordinary

27:56.551 --> 28:07.045
opportunity for a boy from the cornfields of Iowa 
to go to this imposing architectural structure in

28:07.345 --> 28:15.032
the farmland of Wisconsin, a place from the last 
century with gargoyles and all that sort of thing.

28:15.072 --> 28:17.915
It was neogothic right there in the middle of 
Wisconsin. The first foreigners I ever talked to,

28:19.276 --> 28:26.643
the first people with advanced degrees, 
essentially, that I ever spoke with were there at

28:19.276 --> 28:26.643
Yerkes. So this summer of 1958 was an 
extraordinary experience. Well, I say that to

28:31.348 --> 28:36.593
answer your question that Naturally, Yerkes 
Observatory was populated and dominated by

28:37.366 --> 28:49.058
classical stellar astronomers, the likes of 
Morgan, Hiltner, Abt, Chandrasekhar. S.

28:49.658 --> 28:50.499
Chandrasekhar. S. Chandrasekhar, and on and on. 
And Kuiper and his entourage of flunkies,

28:53.382 --> 29:06.715
essentially, some transports or transplants 
from England, amateur astronomers from England,

28:53.382 --> 29:06.715
and here this kid down in the darkroom rubbing 
prints with the great man himself. So Kuiper was an

29:06.897 --> 29:08.218
anomaly. His program was an anomaly. And all of us 
who were part of it were made to feel anomalous. We

29:14.625 --> 29:16.367
were, sure, treated well. I was given opportunity 
to spend evenings playing with a 40-inch

29:16.527 --> 29:22.073
telescope and so on. Yet there was this element of 
the whole thing was an amateur astronomy project.

29:28.139 --> 29:33.044
Do you think the fact that Kuiper was able to get big 
bucks out of the Air Force rankled with some of the?

29:33.184 --> 29:36.027
Oh, I think it must have, sure. The thing that I have 
to keep reminding myself is that when I got

29:36.563 --> 29:57.829
acquainted with Kuiper in that summer of 1958, the 
man had already done an entire career's worth of

29:36.563 --> 29:57.829
classical stellar astronomy, double star work, 
white dwarf work, and stellar spectroscopy, and

29:36.563 --> 29:57.829
done excellent work, the bolometric corrections 
and so on, some of which is still very valuable

29:36.563 --> 29:57.829
work. He had begun to pursue solar system work as 
essentially an outgrowth of his interest in

29:58.872 --> 30:06.499
binary stars and their formation and so on. But the 
man already had this strong scientific

30:06.519 --> 30:14.086
reputation before he even began to pursue 
planetary things. And as I've pointed out in my

30:14.607 --> 30:22.113
biographical memoir, his discovery of the 
atmosphere of Titan was purely an accident. He ran

30:22.334 --> 30:25.977
out of white dwarfs to take spectra of during the 
night at McDonald's And he decided to look at a few

30:26.345 --> 30:36.054
planetary objects, discovered methane on Titan, 
and that was a sort of beginning of his

30:26.345 --> 30:36.054
observational work in planetary astronomy. 
Well, anyway, that was an accident. But he was the

30:37.856 --> 30:49.507
director of Yerkes, the director of this bunch of 
stellar classical astrophysics prima donnas,

30:37.856 --> 30:49.507
who by this time had, I think, grown to loathe him. 
Yet they had to deal with him because he was the

30:50.328 --> 30:55.373
director, and he also commanded this very large 
amount of funding. from an unexpected source. It

30:58.672 --> 31:09.166
was from a government source, and astronomers 
weren't used to that in those days, and they had no

30:58.672 --> 31:09.166
choice but to deal with him, this person with a 
richness of resources. So I think there was a

31:09.586 --> 31:16.075
resentment there that grew out of the jealousy 
over the funding. It grew out of the the difficulty

31:18.337 --> 31:21.382
of his personality. When Otto Struve was the 
director, Otto was able to keep these prima donnas

31:22.183 --> 31:33.763
pretty much in harmony, just because of the 
strength of his own personality and his own

31:22.183 --> 31:33.763
managerial skills. But when Struve was gone, the 
place began to unravel. And it unraveled along a

31:39.785 --> 31:50.657
variety of lines that were related to these strong 
personalities, the diversity of scientific

31:39.785 --> 31:50.657
interests, and no doubt the jealousy over 
research funds. In your personal opinion, back

31:51.518 --> 32:05.534
around 1958, 59, 60, do you think that planetary 
astronomy was considered second rate and

31:51.518 --> 32:05.534
inferior by the, quote, establishment? Oh, it's 
clear to me that it was, yes. As I say, my first

32:09.232 --> 32:15.479
connections with the establishment were at this 
rather peculiar place, Yerkes Observatory. But

32:16.000 --> 32:35.762
as I expanded my experiences and contacts to 
various other places in the country and other

32:16.000 --> 32:35.762
institutions, it became clearer and clearer that 
planetary science, planetary astronomy, as it

32:16.000 --> 32:35.762
was considered in those days, that's really all 
there was, was definitely regarded as inferior.

32:36.046 --> 32:42.532
And I've spent the last 30 years in some ways trying 
to understand how that came to be. And is there any

32:43.233 --> 32:46.596
way to, is there any antidote for it? Or are we 
always going to be plagued with this problem as

32:47.477 --> 32:53.863
long as planetary science is identified as such? 
That brings up the next question. How do you think

32:55.384 --> 33:01.430
real, quote unquote, astronomers think of 
planetary astronomy now? Now.

33:06.539 --> 33:24.200
I believe that the generation represented by 
Kuiper, and this includes such people as Jeff

33:06.539 --> 33:24.200
Burbage, who was a personal enemy of Kuiper, and 
various other people of that generation still

33:06.539 --> 33:24.200
have rather negative feelings about it. Let's say 
the people at what's now Mount Palomar

33:24.480 --> 33:35.533
Observatory, these folks are cosmologists 
primarily. and classical astronomers. And I'm

33:38.204 --> 33:42.773
sure they have a very dim view of the value of 
planetary science. The Mount Wilson syndrome.

33:44.335 --> 33:45.057
Yeah, right. But even in Hawaii, where we had a 
rather unusual situation. As I say, the program

33:51.950 --> 33:54.474
was just getting started in 1970. That is, the 
nighttime astronomy program was just getting

33:54.775 --> 33:58.602
started. And planetary people were already 
involved. Bill Sinton was there, David Morrison,

34:01.274 --> 34:04.898
Bob Murphy, and then I showed up in 1970. And 
because I know I wrote the funding memo, that funds

34:05.479 --> 34:14.769
were given to Hawaii, committed for a long time, 
that they must do planetary work. That's right.

34:15.209 --> 34:16.411
They must do planetary work.

34:19.294 --> 34:21.216
And that was all fine. I mean, that's why the 
telescope was built, but it was clear that it would

34:21.296 --> 34:24.960
be used for A large fraction of the time would be for 
planetary work and the remainder for classical

34:25.278 --> 34:30.723
astronomy. The point I'd like to make is that that 
program developed and grew with a complete

34:31.584 --> 34:43.036
intertwining of classical astronomers, stellar 
astronomers, and planetary people. And the

34:43.736 --> 34:52.365
outcome of that was very positive in that there was 
a mutual respect, a family atmosphere and

34:43.736 --> 34:52.365
attitude, such that we all took a lot of pleasure in 
each other's successes and discoveries. And

34:59.474 --> 35:12.706
people interested in galaxies, such as Alan 
Stockton, people interested in classical

34:59.474 --> 35:12.706
stellar spectroscopy, such as Sidney Wolfe and 
Walter Bonsack, were working side by side with

34:59.474 --> 35:12.706
those people I've already mentioned doing 
planetary work. And as we grew up together, all of

35:13.307 --> 35:18.572
us having gone there, except Bill Sinton as fairly 
young people, we developed camaraderie and a

35:18.907 --> 35:30.602
family mood, which was very productive and very 
supportive. Before I left Hawaii, that had begun

35:30.682 --> 35:39.193
to change because John Jeffries had left, Don Hall 
had become the director, and his hiring policies

35:39.595 --> 35:48.829
had put into faculty positions there a larger 
number of cosmologists and people interested in

35:39.595 --> 35:48.829
extragalactic studies. And so the attitude 
toward planetary science, I think, even in

35:49.690 --> 36:00.526
Hawaii, had begun to shift a bit, to become a little 
less tolerant, a little less interested, and

35:49.690 --> 36:00.526
maybe a little less respectful. However, while I 
was still there, planetary astronomy had, still

36:06.730 --> 36:12.278
an important role at the Institute, primarily 
because of the funding structure. Also, we had,

36:12.979 --> 36:33.430
you know, productive scientists, but there was 
still sort of a cudgel that we held in that the

36:12.979 --> 36:33.430
88-inch telescope was still supported primarily 
by a grant from NASA Planetary Programs, and in the

36:12.979 --> 36:33.430
form of a large single grant that exceeded a 
quarter of a million dollars for a combination of

36:12.979 --> 36:33.430
support of the telescope, and the support of the 
planetary research, all of which was under the

36:33.798 --> 36:39.871
single umbrella of one grant. And that structure 
broke down essentially as I left by mutual

36:39.891 --> 36:46.705
agreement with headquarters and the Institute 
for Astronomy. But at least during the years I was

36:47.126 --> 36:51.395
there, planetary astronomy was respected. It was 
well supported. And we had a wonderful supportive

36:53.373 --> 36:58.198
arrangement with the classical stellar 
astronomers. I think that is less so now. That was

37:00.180 --> 37:03.244
one case where people actually talked to each 
other. That's right, and in friendly terms. One

37:07.549 --> 37:08.790
last thing about Kuiper. Do you think the fact that 
he was in what was considered a second rate field

37:09.010 --> 37:20.663
reinforced his personality character, his 
negative personality characters, and gave him

37:09.010 --> 37:20.663
this embattled status? I'm not so sure. I think 
Kriper was a difficult personality to the core,

37:22.306 --> 37:46.541
and that he had an element of arrogance and 
self-assurance that allowed him to rise above or

37:22.306 --> 37:46.541
beyond the criticisms of his colleagues and 
pursue his own path with complete

37:22.306 --> 37:46.541
self-assurance. At the time, he had a good 
relationship with S. Chandrasekhar, I think they

37:50.832 --> 37:56.418
also had some difficult times, but they were in 
very different areas of science. And I think that,

37:56.438 --> 38:10.213
well, I'm not sure where I was going with that, but 
I'll just say again that I think Kuiper didn't have

37:56.438 --> 38:10.213
a siege mentality. He felt completely 
self-assured that his course was right. Now we'll

38:15.038 --> 38:18.342
get on to a different subject, and this is 
something that I'm Nothing has been written about

38:20.026 --> 38:21.708
this. And the people involved are all dead. So I've 
got to ask people's personal opinions who are in

38:25.471 --> 38:29.114
the field now. At the turn of the century, 
planetary astronomy was still a popular topic. I

38:34.639 --> 38:38.403
mean, Henry Norris Russell did stuff on Venus and 
all that. By 1920, it was not only not popular, it

38:38.423 --> 38:45.709
wasn't safe to be in what killed planetary 
astronomy. I think two people killed it. I think

38:47.954 --> 38:52.700
Percival Lowell killed it in the United States, 
and Camille Flammarion killed it in Europe.

38:52.720 --> 38:56.385
That's exactly Gerard de Vaucouleur's comment. 
Well, I haven't talked to de Vaucouleur about

38:56.405 --> 38:59.910
this, but I... It's right in this book. Good, 
great. I came to this awareness when I was

39:02.253 --> 39:13.388
researching some work by Barnard, Edward Emerson 
Barnard, on his life and times. Barnard was a voice

39:14.633 --> 39:19.578
of reason during the Canals on Mars era. He was a 
Chautauqua series lecturer with lantern slides

39:21.119 --> 39:33.611
of pictures that he had taken, being one of the 
great pioneers of photography and astronomy and

39:21.119 --> 39:33.611
discoverer of comets and whatnot, and the fifth 
satellite of Jupiter. He was a well-known

39:33.671 --> 39:43.240
personality, but he didn't write popular books 
and didn't have the same charisma, contacts, and

39:33.671 --> 39:43.240
persona that Percival Lowell did. Percival 
Lowell wrote numerous books on the habitability

39:43.777 --> 40:02.323
of Mars and the nature of Mars' intelligent 
civilization and all this and that, based in large

39:43.777 --> 40:02.323
part upon his observations and those of his 
colleagues under his thumb at Lowell Observatory

39:43.777 --> 40:02.323
of the canals and seasonal changes on Mars. This 
attracted a lot of attention in the popular press

40:03.485 --> 40:12.197
and lent an aura of of silliness to planetary 
studies as seen by classical astronomers. What

40:21.023 --> 40:31.938
you indicated was true, that a major part of the 
program of nearly all professional astronomical

40:21.023 --> 40:31.938
observatories in the latter part of the 19th 
century was planetary work. They were doing

40:32.799 --> 40:38.387
planetary visual observations, searches for 
satellites, spectroscopy and photography, what

40:38.620 --> 40:41.543
have you. And this was a very legitimate part of 
classical astronomy at the end of the 19th

40:42.183 --> 40:48.750
century. Well, this business about the canals on 
Mars, I think, gave that an aura of science fiction

40:49.570 --> 41:04.144
and that primarily the efforts and the charisma of 
Percival Lowell in this country did it. I believe,

41:04.825 --> 41:07.007
although I'm not as well acquainted with it, that 
parallel activity in Europe by Flammarion with,

41:07.358 --> 41:18.313
again, a volley of popular books and articles 
produced essentially the same effect there.

41:20.156 --> 41:23.921
What's the best piece of work you've done in 
astronomy? The best piece of work I've done is

41:23.941 --> 41:35.357
probably the work on the spectrum of Neptune's 
satellite, Triton, in which persistence in

41:36.316 --> 41:58.250
Studying the near-infrared spectrum produced 
the detection and identification of methane,

41:36.316 --> 41:58.250
frozen methane on Triton, and frozen nitrogen, 
which we now recognize as the dominant material on

41:36.316 --> 41:58.250
the surface of Triton and Pluto. I continue to 
pursue this as the technology permits us to do a

41:59.632 --> 42:04.720
better and better job. Now, in 1989, of course, 
Voyager flew by Triton and found some very

42:05.392 --> 42:17.750
interesting things and corroborated the 
presence of nitrogen and methane, but it didn't

42:05.392 --> 42:17.750
show anything else. And in the meantime, we've 
found from additional ground-based work, carbon

42:18.030 --> 42:30.449
dioxide and carbon monoxide ices on Triton, and 
evidence of some other very interesting

42:18.030 --> 42:30.449
hydrocarbons, which we haven't even yet 
announced. So it turns out that the persistence in

42:31.911 --> 42:34.875
trying to detect, measure, and interpret the 
spectrum of a little object, 30 astronomical

42:35.463 --> 43:04.558
units from the sun, something that has a 
temperature in the neighborhood of less than 40

42:35.463 --> 43:04.558
Kelvin and is to the telescope only almost 14th 
magnitude, has proven to be a very, very rich

42:35.463 --> 43:04.558
spectrum, which we continue to interpret and find 
extremely interesting chemistry and

42:35.463 --> 43:04.558
information on the early development of the solar 
system. What did you have the most fun doing so far?

43:08.410 --> 43:11.893
Well, certainly the work on nitrogen has been some 
of the most fun. I also had an enormous amount of fun

43:13.134 --> 43:20.861
with our 20-micron detections of faint objects in 
the solar system. And I remember very well

43:21.602 --> 43:34.393
standing on the Cassegrain platform in the cold at 
the 88-inch telescope in Hawaii in the mid-'70s,

43:21.602 --> 43:34.393
measuring the thermal radiation from Trojan 
asteroids at 20 microns. These are objects which

43:36.025 --> 43:39.971
had never been detected thermally before. And I 
was able to get the first measurements of heat from

43:40.933 --> 43:48.425
those dark, small, little objects. And by the way, 
the detection of heat itself indicated that they

43:48.906 --> 43:56.538
were dark objects which absorbed a lot of sunlight 
and had low albedos. Similarly, with two of the

43:56.558 --> 44:01.225
outer satellites of Jupiter, I knew what I was 
looking for. I knew that if I could detect them at

44:01.508 --> 44:05.212
all, that that meant they were little black 
objects. And standing there on the platform

44:05.873 --> 44:13.923
seeing the strip chart recorder make a positive 
detection was a tremendous thrill. Have you had

44:15.164 --> 44:17.106
any fiascos or dead ends? Oh, sure. I've had some 
mistakes. What's your greatest fiasco? Well, I'd

44:20.631 --> 44:28.680
preface this by saying that I've enjoyed being on 
what is a cutting edge. of detections and

44:29.065 --> 44:32.989
measurements in planetary astronomy. And when 
you're on an edge, you can fall sometimes on one

44:33.770 --> 44:38.876
side and fall sometimes on the other. I've already 
told you about the successes in which I fell on the

44:39.437 --> 44:44.262
right side of the edge. There have been a couple of 
failures where I've fallen on the other side.

44:48.247 --> 44:57.317
Probably the worst one was the apparent detection 
of helium emission in the spectrum of Io,

44:48.247 --> 44:57.317
Jupiter's satellite Io. We in Hawaii, one of the 
first things I did there was to work on a

44:58.276 --> 45:05.066
near-infrared Fourier transform spectrometer. 
And one of the first things we looked at with this

45:05.967 --> 45:18.746
spectrometer after we finally got it online with 
the 88-inch telescope was IO, by which time sodium

45:05.967 --> 45:18.746
emission had already been detected in the 
spectrum by Robert Brown and colleagues. But we

45:19.407 --> 45:21.150
looked at it, and we detected this. We, that is with 
Carl Pilcher and Bill Sinton, we detected helium

45:21.310 --> 45:28.080
emission, the 10-8-30 band or line of helium. We 
rushed to a meeting that was held in Ithaca and

45:28.617 --> 45:35.102
reported this and sent out an IAU circular on it. 
And Don Hunton congratulated us on the detection

45:35.663 --> 45:39.726
of helium emission. No one understood what it 
meant, but they were all willing to believe that

45:39.786 --> 45:46.012
this very peculiar object had helium emission. 
And we all set out to understand it. And then we

45:48.394 --> 45:58.202
discovered that this was spurious because the 
interferometer control system used a helium

45:48.394 --> 45:58.202
lamp. to provide the clocking frequency. And 
while we could not imagine how this Spiria signal

46:03.298 --> 46:09.805
got into the signal chain, indeed it did. And our 
detection of helium on Io was wrong. And Larry

46:13.770 --> 46:21.138
Trafton continues to remind me of that, even 
though the rest of the world until this very moment

46:13.770 --> 46:21.138
has forgotten, mercifully forgotten. If you read 
any of the popular books about exploration of the

46:24.457 --> 46:30.144
solar system that have been coming out in the last 
20 years. It's all done by the space probes. Of

46:32.307 --> 46:32.688
course. What's your opinion? My opinion is that 
the space probes wouldn't have even known where to

46:35.111 --> 46:44.964
go or what to look at or how to look at it if it hadn't 
been for the work that has been done on the ground.

46:45.524 --> 46:52.253
And certainly the incremental improvement in our 
understanding of the planets was enormously

46:45.524 --> 46:52.253
augmented by the space probes. space probes. But 
I'd remind you again just what I said. When Voyager

46:56.083 --> 47:04.133
got to Triton, it detected nitrogen and methane, 
but it sure didn't see the carbon monoxide or the

46:56.083 --> 47:04.133
carbon dioxide.
