WEBVTT

00:04.385 --> 00:05.066
Okay, let's go. Okay, I'm ready. Enough about 2001 
nights. Now, first of all, I should like to know

00:09.933 --> 00:12.957
what interested you in oceanography.

00:17.043 --> 00:18.044
Specifically, you mean? Specifically,

00:18.545 --> 00:22.190
yeah. Well, my first real involvement in 
oceanography was during World War II with surf and

00:22.210 --> 00:32.164
beaches. working out of the University of 
California on landing craft, performance of

00:32.853 --> 00:40.683
waves, depths. That was my first actual 
scientific involvement, 1945, I guess, 44, or

00:40.824 --> 00:51.818
thereabouts.

00:52.179 --> 00:57.786
More generally, of course, I'd been interested in 
oceanography or in the oceans quite a long time

00:52.179 --> 00:57.786
before that. I was a commercial fisherman for 
three years off the Oregon coast and always was

01:02.924 --> 01:12.918
since childhood was interested in the oceans and 
got a great thrill out of fishing in a surf or off the

01:02.924 --> 01:12.918
boat or out of a skiff. When were you a commercial 
fisherman? About 1936 to 39. I have you at Oregon

01:18.386 --> 01:22.191
State University from 30 to 41. That's about 
right. Took me about that long to get through. But I

01:25.676 --> 01:27.359
don't have you receiving a degree. I didn't. I got a 
degree at Berkeley. That's right. What did you do

01:31.718 --> 01:34.261
at Oregon State University? Oh, I took things as 
long as I could stand it, and then did something

01:34.281 --> 01:38.606
else. I joined and went in the Forestry Service, 
worked in the Three C's, the Resettlement

01:38.766 --> 01:48.076
Administration, worked as a logger, went 
fishing, then go back to school. Fortunately, I

01:49.418 --> 01:54.884
sort of kept up my academic record there at 
reasonably respectable levels. It was a It was a

01:57.869 --> 02:04.858
good experience because it allowed me to take all 
kinds of different subjects, which I always felt I

01:57.869 --> 02:04.858
profited from. Engineering, science, 
literature.

02:09.664 --> 02:17.153
Much better, I think, than in my particular case, 
than going straight through school in some sort of

02:09.664 --> 02:17.153
rigorous curriculum. Was it economic pressure or 
the depression that sent you to these various

02:17.173 --> 02:24.062
jobs, or was it just wanderlust?

02:24.346 --> 02:33.640
I was all three plus my poor handling of my finances 
at various times, such finances as they were

02:24.346 --> 02:33.640
possible in those days. And did you primarily 
concentrate on science while you were at Oregon

02:34.742 --> 02:40.550
State or just? Yeah, science, math, I took quite a 
bit of literature, history, paleontology,

02:40.570 --> 02:47.080
engineering, chemistry, chemical engineering. 
Do you think this sort of broad education is

02:50.925 --> 02:56.191
necessary for scientists? I think this kind of 
broad education is essential if we're going to

02:56.211 --> 03:03.519
solve our problems. We have to have both 
penetrating minds and broadly comprehensive

03:04.920 --> 03:13.209
ones. People who have broad interests And I would 
take exception to your point, education, because

03:16.220 --> 03:24.151
I think a person who's broadly interested will 
educate themselves into these broader areas. But

03:24.952 --> 03:39.031
the whole idea that science is going to make its 
breakthroughs and understanding of the universe

03:24.952 --> 03:39.031
and man's position in it from narrow approaches 
versus is balderdash. It's got to have both,

03:40.473 --> 03:45.940
narrowly penetrating approaches and very 
broadly comprehensive ones. Science, of course,

03:46.460 --> 03:52.388
has capitalized the last few centuries on taking 
things apart. And now it's clear the problem of

03:53.330 --> 03:55.673
putting things together. And that's going to take 
people who have looked at all the parts spread

03:55.713 --> 03:59.939
around the floor, you see. We're much in the 
position of a 12-year-old stating the TV apart on

04:00.740 --> 04:09.993
the kitchen floor, you know, without seeing quite 
how it was together in the first place in our

04:00.740 --> 04:09.993
science. I noticed when you go to Berkeley, you 
major in engineering. That's what your degree is,

04:14.359 --> 04:16.382
a BS in engineering. The fastest degree I could 
get. Oh, okay. Was there such a thing as marine

04:20.963 --> 04:24.549
engineering then? No, no, no. Well, there was 
marine engineering, but that's boat building

04:25.510 --> 04:29.716
type of thing. Old-fashioned marine 
engineering, yeah. No, I took civil. Okay. And

04:37.488 --> 04:40.332
expediency steered you in this direction? No, I 
had... The reason I took engineering is early in

04:44.358 --> 04:56.917
the war, just before the war, I took a job as 
surveyor on a big naval base and rather rapidly

04:44.358 --> 04:56.917
became the chief engineer without any 
engineering training. And this interested me

04:58.339 --> 05:02.545
quite a bit, several factors. First, engineering 
was interesting, which is only applied physics,

05:02.566 --> 05:07.833
really. And secondly, the fact I could do that well 
without any formal engineering training seemed

05:11.543 --> 05:17.250
to me to indicate that that might be my fork. And so I 
thought, why not get an engineering degree from

05:17.270 --> 05:23.077
the best engineering school? So I did so. What were 
your career goals when you received an

05:25.000 --> 05:29.165
engineering degree? My career goals were to do... 
I mean, when I did that, I thought I was going to be an

05:34.051 --> 05:37.055
engineer. I truly did. My grandfather had been an 
engineer and charge of the Harriman lines, chief

05:41.547 --> 05:46.834
engineer for the Harriman lines. My father had 
been chief engineer for the Canadian Pacific. And

05:52.361 --> 06:00.732
I'd always been told I was going to be an engineer, 
and I always had resented it and refused to

05:52.361 --> 06:00.732
consider it. And at this time, I decided, yeah, 
that's what I'm going to be. Then when I went out

06:05.217 --> 06:08.061
looking for a job, they all sounded being the 
sectional engineer at Dunsmuir or something like

06:09.931 --> 06:14.156
that. I went back and asked Dean O'Brien if I 
couldn't do some research in the engineering

06:14.176 --> 06:25.951
department, and that's where I got started on the 
waves, beaches, and surf. Oh, okay. That's where I

06:28.875 --> 06:31.258
first met Ravel, too. Where, here? No, on the 
waves, beaches, and surf. Oh, okay. That's what he

06:36.144 --> 06:36.845
said. I was shocked all of a sudden when you 
introduced him. Something that didn't work out.

06:42.018 --> 06:44.442
Do you ever regret having not taken a higher 
degree? Do I ever regret it? No, I don't think so.

06:48.650 --> 06:55.763
I'm often told to make sure I never get one because 
it's a phenomenon to have somebody and not have

06:48.650 --> 06:55.763
one, you see. Do you think failure to earn one has 
limited your career, if I may use that word? I don't

07:04.437 --> 07:06.540
know. I haven't really thought about it a hell of a 
lot. It's never worried me anyway. Let me try it a

07:13.089 --> 07:14.130
different way. Does it seem to you as if the 
movement towards professional degrees since

07:14.210 --> 07:28.470
World War II, when in effect graduate degrees have 
become essential to the various academic

07:14.210 --> 07:28.470
professions, do you think that's potentially a 
mistake? Well, I think I would have progressed

07:30.003 --> 07:42.207
farther and accomplished less, or I could have 
progressed farther by accomplishing less, let me

07:30.003 --> 07:42.207
say, if I'd had a higher degree there. statement. 
Yeah. No, what strikes me is there are all kinds of

07:45.301 --> 07:53.909
historians and scientists who come out of World 
War II with either no degrees or BA degrees who

07:45.301 --> 07:53.909
accomplish a great deal. That ends someplace in 
the 50s as society becomes more technical. And

07:57.613 --> 08:01.016
yet, in a way, it doesn't seem to be as creative now 
as it once was. Would you agree with that? Well, I

08:03.159 --> 08:03.679
don't know. The pros and cons about the higher 
degrees, it tends to be a document that is an

08:03.719 --> 08:12.548
entree, of course. And I one time had a student who 
was, I thought, quite dull. And I tried to persuade

08:17.407 --> 08:23.254
him to forget and get a higher degree. And he said, 
you mean all those five years of work is wasted? And

08:30.282 --> 08:32.365
I said, you mean you didn't learn anything? I said, 
what were you doing? It can't be wasted. And he

08:37.044 --> 08:40.250
stopped for a minute, and then he said the most 
intelligent thing he's ever said. He says, you

08:40.310 --> 08:48.003
know, Dr. Isaacs, which was an interesting 
statement in itself, I'm just not smart enough to

08:40.310 --> 08:48.003
get anywhere without a PhD.

08:52.630 --> 08:53.993
And he wasn't, that's for sure. So you see, the PhD, 
it seems to me, and the higher degrees have their

08:54.433 --> 09:00.203
pros and cons associated with them. now i want to 
break away from chronology for a second and i want

09:02.663 --> 09:27.000
you to describe and give the significance of these 
things i've listed good heavens okay and uh and now

09:02.663 --> 09:27.000
first of all before i begin where did as an engineer 
were you asked to solve specialized problems is

09:02.663 --> 09:27.000
this what accounts for this list of inventions or 
As a matter of fact, did these come to you? You're

09:30.681 --> 09:33.405
telling me now that you're going to give me a list of 
inventions. Yes, that's right. No, I always

09:36.330 --> 09:39.094
selected my own problems first. And people didn't 
come to you with research problems and say, how

09:40.796 --> 09:46.244
would you as an engineer solve this? Sometimes. 
Sometimes, all right. Sure. Well, if that

09:48.568 --> 09:50.751
happened in the process. Folks came to me and asked 
me about how you'd make a mid-water trawl frame.

09:56.800 --> 09:56.920
Right. Well, if that occurred in the process of 
mentioning these, would you explain who came to

09:57.912 --> 10:04.761
you and what were the circumstances, too, 
involved? Sure. Good heavens, that sounds like an

10:06.263 --> 10:08.446
endless list. No, I only listed 12 or 13, just not 
all of them, as a matter of fact. 1945, a device for

10:15.216 --> 10:19.942
traversing surf zones and beaches. Oh. Well, I was 
working then on amphibious craft and several

10:21.858 --> 10:25.762
aspects. How in the devil did you get a line out 
through these tremendous surfs of Northern

10:26.222 --> 10:31.087
California and Oregon and Washington? Well, you 
could shoot one out. And I would watch during the

10:34.510 --> 10:46.562
war boats come in, land on the beach, get 
broadside, swamped, and somebody trying to get a

10:34.510 --> 10:46.562
line through to pull them off or help them one way or 
another. And they get broached and swamped and so

10:47.123 --> 10:49.245
forth. So wouldn't it be nice if you could just send 
a line out? Now, wouldn't it be nice if you could put

10:51.878 --> 11:03.774
something in the surface that would take an 
instrument out there so you could measure the

10:51.878 --> 11:03.774
waves, or put a rod on it and measure the surface? So 
it's obvious that waves have plenty of power to do

11:03.834 --> 11:07.679
this kind of thing. So you make a flap, and you 
rectify the wave so that the forces are only out,

11:07.699 --> 11:17.973
and you put it together. And he said, no, nobody 
came to me on that one, of course. Okay. Does your

11:23.157 --> 11:27.682
work with this lead you later on to working with... 
Wave power, wave propulsion, sure. Sure, years

11:30.966 --> 11:31.847
later. Also understanding something about 
undertow and worrying about sand motion, quite a

11:32.929 --> 11:39.256
few things. All right. And this began in effect 
from a military project. Yeah, a military project

11:43.281 --> 11:46.805
of understanding amphibious craft. Okay. Would 
you... adjudge the military, if I may say that, to

11:49.422 --> 11:55.568
play a sizable role in the development and 
advancement of oceanography in this period?

11:56.309 --> 11:56.829
Well, of course. The ONR, which was Revelle's 
baby, was, of course, a powerful influence and a

11:56.849 --> 12:02.895
very, very valuable one. One of the best sponsors 
of research that ever existed. I was also thinking

12:07.960 --> 12:15.667
possibly about experience gained in things like 
in anti-submarine warfare, for example, in

12:07.960 --> 12:15.667
anti-mine activities. Sure. A lot of those things 
have worked out.

12:20.810 --> 12:24.258
You really have to look at the environment of a 
submarine. And this gives you, I think, requires

12:24.278 --> 12:34.282
considerable thought into just exactly what is 
the meaning of placing this object in the ocean and

12:24.278 --> 12:34.282
its influences on it. Some of that, of course, 
classified material. the mine itself, the object

12:40.047 --> 12:54.828
on the bottom, the manner in which scour takes 
place, the release of particles, the release of

12:40.047 --> 12:54.828
bubbles, the influence, the collections of fish 
around it as part of the biological response to

12:40.047 --> 12:54.828
this object. All these things are involved. are 
part of beginning to build up a model of how the

12:56.720 --> 13:05.549
ocean puts together, even though they are 
directed towards a specific military need, I

12:56.720 --> 13:05.549
think. If you look at them not as a highly specified 
task, but rather as, from the broader standpoint

13:05.970 --> 13:22.727
of here as an object within the natural 
environment, how does it make its presence known

13:05.970 --> 13:22.727
and what are its influences? Then, of course, if 
you look at it that way, it has not just the military

13:24.209 --> 13:28.175
limitation. ONR allowed you to do these sorts of 
things. It was one of the most...

13:34.044 --> 13:48.224
ONR, I think, was one of the freest and most 
valuable types of sponsorship that oceanography

13:34.044 --> 13:48.224
has ever had. Do you think ONR is more 
mission-oriented now than it was then? Oh, sure.

13:52.110 --> 13:52.871
Sure, I think so. I hardly know what it... supply 
kind of very little contact with it. I think it's

13:57.168 --> 14:00.475
gotten very mission-oriented. Is there any 
particular explanation for that? Oh, I think the

14:03.922 --> 14:11.677
whole United States has never kind of quite 
recovered from the more bangs for a buck or how many

14:03.922 --> 14:11.677
philosophy. That is, a fixed objective towards 
which you progress It never allows for the

14:18.243 --> 14:22.730
unexpected to emerge, does it? The unexpected is 
almost always more valuable than the expected,

14:22.750 --> 14:29.160
because expected is something you obviously know 
can exist. Unexpected can be unlimited in its

14:29.380 --> 14:33.005
importance.

14:36.050 --> 14:39.936
What about the magnesium rod release device in 
1947? Oh, heavens.

14:44.804 --> 14:53.935
I was trying to make a pressure gauge for measuring 
waves in deep water and did so, but I needed to load

14:44.804 --> 14:53.935
it in cockets. After it got to depth, I needed to 
open up a reservoir so it flooded with gas, and I

14:55.177 --> 15:01.685
needed something that was simple that would 
release it. And Dean O'Brien said to me, as a matter

15:02.967 --> 15:08.854
of fact, Dean O'Brien, the head of the engineering 
school at Berkeley, said to me, Why don't you look

15:09.307 --> 15:10.669
into magnesium? It makes a good little battery 
with steel or brass. And so I put it together, and it

15:15.015 --> 15:19.261
looked fine. Just held the valve open with a 
magnesium wire, and after an easily calculable

15:19.281 --> 15:27.033
time, it released. And that all led into looking at 
magnesium batteries and magnesium as its power

15:27.734 --> 15:34.263
source. OK. That's what I wanted to know. OK. What 
about the torpedo net in 1947? Yeah. Yeah, that was

15:40.848 --> 15:44.472
a more or less specific project. And that was one of 
the few projects I ever worked with what was then

15:44.572 --> 15:59.648
the Bureau of Yards and Docks, I think, in which 
they had a great deal of trouble with torpedo nets

15:44.572 --> 15:59.648
tearing apart. Well, a torpedo net is a very 
strange object. manner in which trash is

16:03.560 --> 16:07.183
distributed through it is complicated. But more 
particularly, that was the first hint I had of

16:07.603 --> 16:24.137
what's more recently developed into several 
things called, for instance, the breakwater, in

16:07.603 --> 16:24.137
that these big net floats behave very curiously in 
the sea. And they behave very curiously because

16:24.538 --> 16:33.465
they were non-Archimedean bodies, to use the word 
improperly.

16:34.289 --> 16:40.795
bodies on the sea surface that had much more 
displacement than they had mass and free to move

16:34.289 --> 16:40.795
with. So they were forced to move in an exaggerated 
fashion. And this is one of the reasons that the

16:45.179 --> 16:58.933
torpedo nets were torn apart, because the floats 
were driven by something other than the orbital

16:45.179 --> 16:58.933
velocities of the waves. And this put them out of 
phase with the net that they were supporting. And

17:04.630 --> 17:18.611
this is the first hint I got of, as you begin to get 
larger and larger things in the ocean,

17:04.630 --> 17:18.611
accelerated forces play the more dominant role 
than surface forces. Does this end up later on then

17:18.631 --> 17:22.117
also involved in the energy project? Oh, sure. 
Yeah. Well, does it also end up... The principal

17:29.448 --> 17:31.431
thing you see is, something that is a concept which 
other people have probably understood much

17:32.609 --> 17:39.259
better than I have. But as you go to these larger and 
larger objects in a varying pressure field, like a

17:39.880 --> 17:55.444
wave,

17:39.880 --> 17:55.444
the smaller objects are driven by drag, ordinary 
drag forces, hydrodynamic drag. And then Even

17:59.491 --> 18:14.691
though you keep everything symmetrical and you 
merely scale it up into larger and larger

17:59.491 --> 18:14.691
dimensions, there's one aspect, and that's the 
accelerated forces, that scales on a one-to-one

17:59.491 --> 18:14.691
basis. That is, the forces are always equal to the 
volume. In other words, the dimension to the third

18:21.119 --> 18:23.642
power. where its surface forces go like the 
dimension squared. And thus, when you begin to get

18:28.560 --> 18:49.981
into very large objects, but not too large 
objects, in the wave field, such as the big lakes or

18:28.560 --> 18:49.981
the Texas Towers, an offshore crewing platform, 
it's clear that they're driven far more by the

18:28.560 --> 18:49.981
accelerated forces, which act on the total volume 
of them, than by the surface forces. And you might

18:51.342 --> 18:53.224
well forget the surface forces. And these are 
aspects that are still forgotten.

18:59.531 --> 19:23.818
For instance, in these big OTEC programs, where 
you're starting to put very large, slow-moving

18:59.531 --> 19:23.818
things in the ocean for ocean thermal energy 
conversion, the people and very erudite people at

18:59.531 --> 19:23.818
APL and Lockheed just totally forgot the fact that 
they're mainly dealing with accelerations,

18:59.531 --> 19:23.818
inertial forces. rather than the ordinary, 
conventional, frictional hydrodynamic

19:25.030 --> 19:29.637
dragons. And so they've made some mistakes.

19:36.787 --> 19:39.251
See, one thing scales like the square of the 
dimensions. The other scales like the cube of the

19:39.291 --> 19:41.093
dimensions. And even though it's a trivial effect 
at very small dimensions, it becomes a dominant on

19:41.133 --> 19:51.308
a very large dimension, since it's going up like 
the cube.

19:55.118 --> 20:02.345
You've been out in the desert, and you've seen 
these great boulders as big as a room that are way

19:55.118 --> 20:02.345
out in the desert somewhere? Yes. How'd they get 
there? They're obviously carried there by water.

20:07.470 --> 20:16.399
Well, at the moment that a flood wave hits a boulder 
like that, the crest of a flood wave hits a boulder,

20:07.470 --> 20:16.399
the boulder is easily moved as a sand grain. 
Because, you see, it's now at that moment subject

20:17.840 --> 20:24.467
to volume forces that scale just exactly like its 
weight. For frictional forces, it didn't care

20:25.342 --> 20:27.324
less. Once the flood flow is established, the 
boulder sits there. It's like a lead toad, of

20:31.928 --> 20:35.491
course. But at that instant, when the crest comes, 
it's as easily moved as a sand grain. So for an

20:39.955 --> 20:41.637
instance, it's moved. And a succession of these, 
and out it is, out in the desert, miles away. You

20:46.161 --> 20:48.724
can't conceive of how it got there. This is all part 
of the same phenomenology. And I think it's an

20:51.166 --> 20:52.547
interesting one. And I believe I've capitalized 
on it in a couple of cases. That came from the

20:58.949 --> 21:00.851
submarine net problem, yes. OK. And what about the 
thermopile wave meter? Well, I watched these.

21:13.165 --> 21:16.809
These are all very old things.

21:18.351 --> 21:21.034
That was a special problem, I think. I wanted to 
see. if we couldn't establish a very simple wave

21:24.100 --> 21:35.737
measuring device that could be put out to sea 
simply by a landing craft, dropped by a landing

21:24.100 --> 21:35.737
craft. So a beach master trying to bring landing 
craft in through the surf could observe the

21:36.958 --> 21:50.057
oncoming waves before they became breakers. on a 
meter of some sort on the beach and guide the

21:51.353 --> 21:59.524
landing craft into the lower breakers to come to 
the surf zone. Now, it didn't need to be exact. All

22:01.546 --> 22:03.368
it needed to be was relative correct. He would see 
big waves coming in. He'd see the breakers. He'd

22:06.973 --> 22:08.435
know they couldn't survive that. And then he'd see 
a series of lower waves coming in. And he could

22:11.779 --> 22:18.508
beckon them in at that point, see, or vector them in 
with a radio.

22:19.214 --> 22:36.070
It was the simplest device I could think of, a bag of 
gas that's adiabatically heated and cooled by the

22:19.214 --> 22:36.070
wave pressure in there and a simple little 
thermopile inside, up against sea water on

22:19.214 --> 22:36.070
conductive to sea water on the other side to make 
the cold junction or the reference junction. And

22:37.292 --> 22:38.993
it just responded to the waves. And he could see the 
high ones, and he could see the low ones. That's all

22:41.115 --> 22:42.096
he had to see. He didn't have to know how high they 
were. He knew that the big ones were producing wave

22:45.660 --> 22:49.103
breakers that He didn't want his craft to be in, and 
you could tell him to retract or to dander at the

22:49.707 --> 22:57.375
optimum times. That was the purpose of that whole

22:57.515 --> 23:03.761
thing. All right. What about the Isaac's Kid 
Midwater Troll? There's a case where Dr. Hubbs

23:09.086 --> 23:18.195
came to me, and

23:09.086 --> 23:18.195
he won. a net to really take the run deep fast and 
take the bath pelagic fish and Lou Kidd and I worked

23:18.631 --> 23:47.389
on that and I must say I think we lucked out on that 
one because it's always been a bit strange to me

23:18.631 --> 23:47.389
that we cut that we got that net hung we got that 
diving vane made We got the bridles cut, and we took

23:48.652 --> 24:08.196
it out to sea, and immediately we filled 
beautifully, dove beautifully, went down deep,

23:48.652 --> 24:08.196
and we could tow it at three, four thousand meters 
at reasonable speeds.

24:08.868 --> 24:13.294
Even today, if those bridles are cut a few inches 
different, the damn thing doesn't work. I never

24:13.695 --> 24:16.078
understood. We could have been so discouraged, 
we'd never have followed it through. And I see that

24:19.563 --> 24:23.709
thing all over the world, and that bridle is right 
to the same inch. And it was pretty much of a thrill,

24:25.492 --> 24:28.376
really, in those days. I remember those days quite 
well. On our first trips out, we would make halls

24:30.259 --> 24:34.605
that would, increased the number of specimens of 
some rare fish in the museums of the world by 50. You

24:40.952 --> 24:41.773
know, one haul.

24:44.658 --> 24:48.926
When there had only been 10 in all the museums of the 
world, we get 500 of the things. And of course, then

24:49.487 --> 24:53.794
specimen after specimen, it was totally 
unidentified. It was quite a thrill. We made a

24:57.400 --> 25:05.748
20-foot one one time, rammed it into the bottom 
through an axe and a parlous. Took one of the

25:07.229 --> 25:10.693
greatest mid-bottom trawls that anybody ever 
took.

25:13.575 --> 25:16.178
Rare brachiopods and glass sponges. That's 
probably considered in terms of oceanography

25:17.939 --> 25:22.964
your most important and famous invention. Would 
you agree with that? Oh, I don't. I wouldn't try to

25:25.941 --> 25:27.002
judge it. It certainly has been very broadly 
spread around the world, and I kind of suffer from

25:27.102 --> 25:43.277
it to some extent because I go to some outlandish 
place, and that's what I'm known for, you see, the

25:27.102 --> 25:43.277
Isaac Kidd Midwether Tronc. Well, I'm really 
trying to edge your question until you're

25:43.297 --> 25:48.702
unfairly, so let me ask you directly. That is, 
if... you should like to name what you consider

25:52.413 --> 25:57.300
your major accomplishment, what would you name? 
You mean something specific? Something

25:59.523 --> 26:00.865
specific, yeah. If you just wanted, you know, it 
was always said John Adams wanted such and such

26:00.925 --> 26:05.371
card upon his tombstone. If you just had to be 
remembered for one thing, what would you like to be

26:05.391 --> 26:08.876
remembered for? Oh, good heavens, I'd hate to be 
remembered for one thing.

26:16.387 --> 26:19.551
Well, I'd rather think this whole approach of this 
Dynamic breakwater is going to be a considerable

26:20.577 --> 26:23.480
breakthrough. I think it's going to 
revolutionize the whole method of defending

26:23.500 --> 26:37.656
ourselves against the destructive influences of 
waves, beach erosion, harbors. I think it has the

26:38.577 --> 26:48.508
potential of allowing the

26:38.577 --> 26:48.508
defense of our eroding coastlines. of protecting 
structures offshore, of making harbors

26:49.248 --> 27:18.343
of refuge in the open sea, of protecting small 
beaches and fishing villages in remote places in a

26:49.248 --> 27:18.343
way that can be afforded,

26:49.248 --> 27:18.343
so that people can pull their primitive boats out 
over the beach and get themselves some fish.

27:19.842 --> 27:28.019
make swimming beaches in places where surf now 
makes it essentially impossible, and on and on.

27:31.566 --> 27:37.378
There's quite a different approach to harbor 
protection, for example, than these damn Robomon

27:31.566 --> 27:37.378
breakwater And of course, it's totally the 
opposite direction. It's interesting to

27:42.339 --> 27:50.351
conceive that no matter how long you developed a 
rubble mound breakwater, you'd never come up with

27:42.339 --> 27:50.351
the idea of putting the lightest possible thing in 
the ocean. And it takes a 180 degree shift to do

27:51.953 --> 27:54.698
that. And it works on a different principle.

27:59.425 --> 28:00.587
I think maybe that's it. I expect to see the iceberg 
really solve some problems. I think the Israelis

28:05.067 --> 28:09.272
would do it now. They don't really have the money. 
But they would do it, except the minimum iceberg

28:12.076 --> 28:15.920
they could bring is too big. It covers the whole 
damn state with three feet of water. The Arabs are

28:21.747 --> 28:24.611
going to do it, or so I've announced. And it 
certainly is a natural one for them. The US is too

28:27.154 --> 28:33.842
followed up, I think, to do anything quite so 
dramatic.
