WEBVTT

00:01.246 --> 00:08.555
Today is Thursday, April the 17th, 1997.

00:08.875 --> 00:11.478
We're at your home in Austin. Would you please tell 
me a little bit about your upbringing, where you

00:11.718 --> 00:20.028
were raised, and all this kind of thing? I was 
raised in Junction City, Kansas. Were you? Yes. My

00:25.214 --> 00:31.101
dad was from Tecumseh,

00:25.214 --> 00:31.101
Kansas. I and my five children immigrated to 
Austin in 1965. In 65? Okay. And how old were the

00:37.444 --> 00:40.511
children when you got here? Oh, ranging. Well, now 
they're, I can tell you what they are now. They

00:44.539 --> 00:45.782
range from 40. Seven to forty-three now. And so you 
couldn't take it back to sixty-five and figure out

00:49.411 --> 00:54.339
how old I was. Anyway, it was ridiculous for 
Frankie and I to marry with nine kids. I want to hear

00:59.006 --> 01:01.210
about that. When you came to Austin, did you start 
working with the press right away, or what did you

01:01.230 --> 01:07.500
do? You never worked at Press, okay. I worked at the 
UT campus with the police corps program. Oh, okay,

01:13.313 --> 01:15.076
all right. I have a master's degree in 
linguistics. Okay. And then I worked at, uh,

01:18.340 --> 01:24.087
Houston, at, uh, Houston Tourism. Okay, yeah. Uh, 
how'd you happen to meet Frank Woodlawn? I met him

01:27.191 --> 01:36.103
at a, a Houston-Hilson University of Texas party. 
why they got together, sociology department of

01:36.927 --> 01:40.291
all things. And he just stopped in. He was walking 
at night, every night, and he would stop in at

01:45.057 --> 01:52.867
various friends' houses for coffee. And I've met 
him now. And you had five children, and Frank had

01:54.729 --> 01:59.175
four children. And you decided you really need... 
I think they made a television show about me. I

02:06.246 --> 02:06.927
think so. Didn't they? Now, tell me, if I might 
inquire further, was your husband, former

02:08.930 --> 02:17.383
husband, first husband, living? Yes. I was 
divorced at the time. How about Frank? His wife had

02:21.149 --> 02:22.972
just died. When did she die? I was trying to 
remember if it was 69 or 68. I cannot remember.

02:31.214 --> 02:33.918
Okay, and he had four sons? No, two sons and two 
daughters. Two sons and two daughters. I never

02:36.862 --> 02:38.424
really checked that out. I'm not saying too much

02:38.484 --> 02:43.191
about it. And you had four, five children, and they 
were sons and daughters? Yeah, four sons and a

02:47.957 --> 02:50.000
daughter. Four sons and a daughter. That was the 
business. And did you, when you married, did you

02:53.455 --> 02:58.120
all really live under the same roof for a while? 
Yeah. They were, well, two of my boys went to Cal

03:00.183 --> 03:07.451
College, both friends. Okay, yeah. And my 
daughter just went to high school, I think, she's

03:07.712 --> 03:15.741
forty-seven now. They were pretty 
well-qualified.

03:20.547 --> 03:20.847
Yeah. And when you married, you lived where? We 
lived up at the Edenroth Apartments first. And

03:30.649 --> 03:34.974
then we bought a duplex, and we lived in a duplex, 
and then we bought a little home out. So, and that

03:36.416 --> 03:38.939
was what year again, 16? We were married January 
1st, 1970. January 1st, 1970. And Frank? No. Frank

03:46.508 --> 03:49.412
was 15 and a half years older than I. Okay. He was 
born in 1913. Yes.

03:57.042 --> 04:05.393
When you walked into that world, publishing in the 
University of Texas Press, how did you feel about

03:57.042 --> 04:05.393
it? I mean, what did you see there? In the first 
place, I thought that Frank, when I met him, had

04:07.476 --> 04:15.467
something to do with newspapers. Okay. I can 
understand that in the way he talks, probably. And

04:19.518 --> 04:26.885
so I didn't know anything about the University 
Press, or any of the University Presses.

04:31.169 --> 04:33.111
But I soon found out. I bet. And was impressed. Was 
it fun? Oh, it was fun. That's a key word of our time

04:40.277 --> 04:44.781
at A.M. was fun. Yeah, I see that a lot in his 
correspondence. When you were here now at Texas

04:49.218 --> 05:04.860
from 1970 to 1974,

04:49.218 --> 05:04.860
you all, I assume now, were pretty closely 
entangled, let's say, with the Betacheks and

04:49.218 --> 05:04.860
Nobby and that sort of thing. He was. He was. They 
had all died before. They had already been. OK. I

05:09.886 --> 05:12.470
didn't believe you then. I'm glad you told me. 
Mm-hmm. But the widow, I remember we went to an

05:13.091 --> 05:19.039
autograph party for the widows once at Schultz 
Garden. Yeah, I remember Mrs. Dudley, and I

05:19.103 --> 05:25.713
remember him vaguely, just... Walter Webb was 
another one. Walter Prescott Webb, yes. And we

05:27.896 --> 05:32.724
loved his wife.

05:32.744 --> 05:34.767
So that world had pretty well already gone. Yes. 
When you walked into the situation. Except for

05:39.073 --> 05:39.934
Frank. Yeah, sure. Who retained the spirit of... 
did how did frank feel about texas from 70 to 74 to

05:45.445 --> 06:12.499
the press and austin and the university he got 
pretty fed up with john silver okay i knew john

05:45.445 --> 06:12.499
silver john silver's son was in my fraternity i 
believe jack and i met him he was dean okay i'm just

05:45.445 --> 06:12.499
nostalgic I don't know how John Silver is, but they 
had attempted to pack the board with Erebus, and it

06:12.648 --> 06:25.670
was such one struggle. That's right. And I know 
Frank just kind of defined the faculty here, he

06:30.098 --> 06:38.031
said at the time, as disgruntled. Now, Spur was the 
president for a while. Yes, he was. I think when a

06:42.690 --> 06:45.973
bank retired. We went and set up a house for a 
farewell or something like that. Now, you all went

06:52.620 --> 07:02.010
to... Help me reconstruct how it was that you 
happened to get to Texas A&M. John Lindsey. Okay.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.735
Now, when did you remember first encountering 
John Lindsey? The first year or two, we were

07:09.010 --> 07:11.714
married. Okay, you were early on. Yes. Now, I don't 
remember when Frank knew me. Okay, what I'm kind of

07:19.125 --> 07:22.029
leading, you can help me. What I kind of get out of 
all this, and talking to Lindsay too, is that John

07:22.049 --> 07:32.264
didn't know Frank Wardlaw until, but he knew Buck 
Shewitz real well. Yes. And Buck asked John

07:33.626 --> 07:37.532
Lindsay to come to a party, I'm going to say, at 
Austin. And I should be able to tell you what party

07:44.070 --> 07:46.634
that was, but I've already forgotten. And Lindsey 
met Frank. And they hit, and this was Lindsey's

07:53.843 --> 08:00.131
expression, they hit it off, right away. And Frank 
also needed John Lindsey at that moment. because

08:04.057 --> 08:07.344
he wanted Buck to do another book. Oh, I see. Okay. 
Does that sound reasonable? It does sound

08:10.750 --> 08:12.273
reasonable. Okay. It does. And he thought John 
could help him get Buck to do that book. Buck always

08:18.305 --> 08:20.149
had to be persuaded. I know that. So that was Buck, 
but apparently then things really... worked out

08:26.737 --> 08:38.231
and everybody seemed to have a good time for a 
while, and y'all were frequent visitors, let's

08:26.737 --> 08:38.231
say, I don't know how frequent, but anyway, you 
visited John both in Houston and Galveston at that

08:26.737 --> 08:38.231
beach house. Yes. Now, let me get to a critical 
moment. This is from Lindsay's account, and also

08:44.138 --> 08:51.968
from Frank's comments in that Catch-22, 
Style-22, that article anyway. He kind of

08:56.182 --> 09:00.847
explained how it was happening there, but there's 
a little difference in the version. And I really

09:01.668 --> 09:08.776
believe John Leeson's is probably the right one, 
because Frank was writing, I think, public, all

09:01.668 --> 09:08.776
consumption. But anyway, John said, and I'm doing 
most of the talking, so just stop me whenever

09:08.796 --> 09:14.422
you're ready. John said that you and Frank were in 
his house, And not in Houston. Frank was fussing

09:23.361 --> 09:26.545
about the faculty. And his advisory committee and 
all things were kind of going to pieces. And so

09:31.231 --> 09:41.042
John's version is that he said, well, Frank, 
basically, why don't you quit bitching and come to

09:31.231 --> 09:41.042
Texas A&M? I did not overhear this conversation, 
but it sounds true. He says you did. He says you were

09:45.608 --> 09:46.629
there. And he says, then the next response was, And 
he may not have put it in quite those immodest

09:50.420 --> 09:55.507
words, I don't know. Anyway, he said, come and 
where you'll be appreciated. And Frank said much

09:58.010 --> 10:03.978
the same as Frank said in his article that you all 
were at the beach house and so forth. And Frank said

10:03.998 --> 10:08.303
that his response was, well, this is a terrible 
time to start a press. And John Lindsay's comment

10:09.184 --> 10:20.359
was that both of you stopped and looked at him and 
didn't say one word.

10:20.491 --> 10:23.655
I don't remember that. Okay. I kind of believe the 
Lindsay version. Because, well, it's hard to

10:27.059 --> 10:32.526
believe, I guess, that Frank didn't have a 
response, I guess, to something at the moment. But

10:32.806 --> 10:38.813
anyway, I think it startled everybody, from what I 
kind of gathered. I don't think Frank had ever

10:38.833 --> 10:40.936
thought about it. Never thought of it. I really 
don't think so. No, I don't think, everything I can

10:43.219 --> 10:45.682
figure. In fact, for a man over 62. Yeah. do this was 
very unusual. Yeah. He was thinking retirement.

10:52.846 --> 10:56.892
That surprised me all through his letters, and I'm 
sure you wrote. He was planning what he was going to

10:57.212 --> 10:59.115
do when he retired. And what was going to happen to 
the press after he retired. And he was going to

11:02.199 --> 11:05.264
retire in 1965, whatever year it was. He had it. 
plan, and he did it. I was amazed. When the time came

11:09.303 --> 11:19.078
when he was 65, he wasn't quite ready, but his 
doctor, Dr. Lipscomb, and I, we were ready. I like

11:19.238 --> 11:21.061
Harry Lipscomb. I haven't seen him in years, but he 
and I got friendly for a while. He's nice. Oh, he's a

11:26.389 --> 11:27.831
lovely man. But anyway, then, according to 
Lindsay, in the version I'm developing, you two

11:36.412 --> 11:38.935
didn't really respond. Now, in Frank's article, 
he says, when I explained that, you know, we

11:39.857 --> 11:46.105
couldn't come because it was a terrible time to 
start a quest. Well, that's true. But anyway, then

11:47.547 --> 11:59.002
John says, and I think this is probably correct, 
that Frank called him about two or three days later

11:47.547 --> 11:59.002
after he had left Houston. He probably had another 
run in the silver. And said, John, I'm going to talk

12:05.572 --> 12:07.754
to you about coming to A&M. And John Lindsay said, 
and I think he's right, I'm way ahead of you.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.864
Because what John Lindsay had already done, I have 
this pretty well documented. Set up an interview

12:16.884 --> 12:19.346
with Jack Williams. Yes. He had it cold. I remember 
that. He had gone to the board of directors. He had

12:24.392 --> 12:27.955
three board members who were all ready for this. In 
fact, they were Clyde Wells and all this. guy in

12:35.508 --> 13:01.853
waco his name is me anyway three boys and and he told 
called uh jack williams and said i'm i'm asking

12:35.508 --> 13:01.853
frank wardlaw to come to a m and start a press what do 
you think about it i was wondering if there was much

12:35.508 --> 13:01.853
commotion about a press if that's all right well 
that's see that's what i've been working on i don't

12:35.508 --> 13:01.853
think much i think it was kind of a foggy notion 
maybe because and one thing that was going on I do

13:02.727 --> 13:27.452
know this I was already writing that Centennial 
History thing and I had started that in 1969 and it

13:02.727 --> 13:27.452
was just about done in fact it was finished by 72 73 
and then of course Rutter had died and we had a lot of

13:02.727 --> 13:27.452
confusion because Jack Williams became 
president in 73 I believe it was he'd just come in

13:27.736 --> 13:32.482
Frank was flounder of Jack Williams and almost any 
administrator living or dead. I want to ask you

13:32.783 --> 13:36.908
about that too. But then Lindsey had all this put 
together so he and Jack came to talk to you and

13:38.130 --> 13:48.984
Frank. Is that right? I think we had a luncheon 
outside the home. In fact, Frank told him to meet

13:55.310 --> 14:03.800
him at the Vagabond Motel, because he didn't want 
to be seen so badly. That's what it was. That sounds

14:04.221 --> 14:05.703
like Ring the Bell. And Lindsay, I'm still 
laughing about that. So anyway, so that was the

14:10.648 --> 14:12.871
next step. Jack Williams and Lindsay talked to 
Frank. Now, what year was this? That was 17... No,

14:17.477 --> 14:20.220
that was 17... still 74. I think that was the 
spring, maybe it was either late 73 or the spring of

14:21.730 --> 14:25.918
74. I believe it was the spring of 74. I remember 
Frank coming home from that meeting saying, Jack

14:29.826 --> 14:36.239
Williams is a fine fellow. That was the first time 
they met. Okay, that's what I had too.

14:44.332 --> 14:48.898
Another question I'm trying to figure out is, 
where did the real initiative for this press come

14:44.332 --> 14:48.898
from? Was it Jack Williams, or was it John Lindsay, 
or who? I think a combination. I think so too. But I

14:55.187 --> 14:57.430
still don't know how it came to pass. No, I don't 
think they do either. And in fact, that's what I

14:59.713 --> 15:03.999
kind of gathered from talking with Lindsay. He 
said, well, Frank, why don't you come over here and

15:04.820 --> 15:07.624
we'll start a press. It never had occurred to him 
before. And then he was tickled. Yeah, and then I

15:12.363 --> 15:19.013
said, well, John, do you like books and so forth? 
No, I don't care for books. So I was trying to figure

15:22.298 --> 15:25.864
out, but what he cared for, of course, was A&M. He's 
the biggest Aggie in the world. He'd do anything

15:27.867 --> 15:29.489
for A&M. And this seemed to be good for A&M. And I 
thought, well, maybe this guy really liked books

15:32.313 --> 15:38.082
or art

15:32.313 --> 15:38.082
or whatever. He did like Frank, and he did like Zach 
Williams, and that little mix worked nicely. So,

15:45.213 --> 15:51.980
then you and Frank go to Austin, to, I'm sorry, to 
College Station. Yes. When was it, in August?

15:55.905 --> 15:56.605
That's about right. No, no, not the move. You moved 
in August, but you went over there to see the signs.

16:04.955 --> 16:06.376
Weren't too terribly thrilled. Okay, that's what 
I wanted to know. No. When did this happen that you

16:09.908 --> 16:15.174
decided to come to college? I don't know, but I knew 
for months and had to keep quiet about it.

16:22.903 --> 16:29.330
Well, I'm making a story out of this, and I'm not 
sure it's right, so you might knock it in the head

16:22.903 --> 16:29.330
real quick if it isn't right. But John Lindsay 
again said, well, we were driving around, and I

16:29.350 --> 16:35.958
went to the old board of directors' house. Pick up 
Buck. Pick up Buck. Okay, good. That's what I'm

16:41.929 --> 16:43.552
looking for, a confirmation. And he said, while I 
went in to get Buck, you and Frank got out of the car

16:44.113 --> 16:50.182
and walked around the house.

16:54.269 --> 17:00.499
And he thinks, I think, that was the moment you 
decided to come to College Station. I just wonder.

17:02.420 --> 17:08.749
Well, we had no idea what... College Station isn't 
the most beautiful place in the world. No, not in

17:09.049 --> 17:13.736
1916, not in 1972 or what it was. Well, the campus 
itself was fine. Yeah. We loved living there.

17:19.443 --> 17:20.665
Still hear those... Those boys yelling back and 
forth, bad words at each other. That's another

17:26.891 --> 17:27.712
world. But to live on the campus. That's really 
changed. The old Aggies are fading, I think. For

17:35.183 --> 17:37.727
better or for worse. But I kind of thought that that 
might really be the time when y'all decided this

17:38.448 --> 17:42.894
was okay. Did you have any sense of that at all? No, 
we didn't know for sure for quite a while. Okay. It

17:49.957 --> 17:51.920
still makes a good story. Yeah, I think it was 
Frank's idea. Wouldn't this be a one-population

17:55.046 --> 17:57.310
plant? And it was. Because I can't even visualize 
the new one. I mean, it's too fancy. Who else has

18:11.094 --> 18:14.901
offices where everybody has a bathroom? A tub. 
Yeah, ten bedrooms. That's right. Well, all the

18:20.979 --> 18:24.162
other rooms, not the apartment. Each one had a 
bathtub. It was a bathtub. A great big bathtub.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.270
Which didn't do Buck much good. He couldn't get in 
and out of it. I think he had a shower put in on top.

18:41.378 --> 18:43.960
Now, so you decide to come. How'd you feel about 
that, leaving Austin? Did you have any sense?

18:48.540 --> 18:51.284
Anything he wanted. I did not care. I mean, about 
leaving Austin, I had only been here a few years, so

18:54.167 --> 19:01.518
I don't have any roots here.

19:04.962 --> 19:10.690
Now, and when you got to College Station, and you 
moved into the old Board of Directors' house, Can

19:11.024 --> 19:14.989
you kind of just describe things that really hit 
you? It was just marvelous, but it was dingy. Okay,

19:18.374 --> 19:19.295
yeah. And nobody mentioned anything about rehab 
in the place, and we wanted it so badly for what it

19:19.636 --> 19:38.922
was that mostly I spent my time making grapes and

19:19.636 --> 19:38.922
this and that, spreading out the furniture so it 
didn't look too bare. Did you bring your own

19:39.863 --> 19:41.385
furniture? Did they? Okay. Except for the sheets. 
Yeah, okay. Old-fashioned cacao sheets.

19:49.793 --> 19:51.074
Starched. Oh, luxury. I think I remember that 
Aggie Laundry. I can't exactly remember. It was

20:00.644 --> 20:01.865
real close.

20:05.408 --> 20:05.989
Now what about Did you have any sense of Texas A&M, 
like the kids? Oh yes, immediately. We had two dogs

20:15.363 --> 20:24.134
at the time, two Scotties, and we would go out every 
night and walk the dogs, and everybody would say

20:15.363 --> 20:24.134
howdy to us. Yeah. And that was nice. In fact, Frank 
had been coming in some of his letters.

20:37.711 --> 20:46.022
Did the military flavor bother you particularly 
at the time?

20:46.042 --> 20:46.242
No. Was that Vietnam time? I can't remember. Yeah, 
that was. And there wasn't much stirring around

20:51.008 --> 20:56.055
Aggieland over that. No, that's right. And just 
when Ohio and Austin, too, were getting the

20:57.898 --> 21:04.326
permit, Very conservative. And still is, but it's 
changed. Our kids, well of course we, I have a son

21:09.552 --> 21:19.909
who went to Vietnam, and Hank's son.

21:25.057 --> 21:27.161
You entertained a lot in the press. Yes. We had 
three bedrooms.

21:33.584 --> 21:36.888
spare bedrooms. And I don't think

21:36.908 --> 21:42.635
a week went by without an accident. No authors or 
just people. And oh, after the football games, we

21:46.740 --> 21:56.892
were the only place on the campus that dispensed 
free booze, and were we popular.

21:59.825 --> 22:01.047
And you enjoyed it? Frank enjoyed it? Oh yes, we 
loved it. I

22:03.290 --> 22:12.001
was busy too, just being a hostess. Yeah, I'm sure 
you were. That's a big part of the whole... I

22:17.509 --> 22:22.255
remember John Graves said, this is the only place I 
like to stay overnight. Well, usually I stay at a

22:23.264 --> 22:29.490
hotel when I go someplace, but this place is fun. It 
was fun, you know. Everybody had that sense, and

22:31.972 --> 22:37.557
that's what kept, I think, everything so upbeat. 
And compared, apparently, to what... And of

22:38.418 --> 22:43.023
course, the staff was just crackerjack. Oh, they 
were always friendly. It was small. It was for a

22:49.329 --> 22:50.269
long time. It was just Gayla. Yeah, Gayla and 
Margaret. And Don Collins comes in a little later.

22:59.866 --> 23:07.553
And then Noel didn't come in until 75 or 76, but 
there were three to start with. Oh, Ray Gamayi. Oh,

23:10.716 --> 23:11.257
yes. Right. That's who it was. Those three. That 
was the start of it. And Ray didn't really get there

23:18.384 --> 23:21.487
until February, I think, of 75. I can't remember 
how. Frank courted Ray. Early on, and he brought

23:26.736 --> 23:33.867
him down almost the same time y'all moved in. 
August through September. Ray came down and

23:35.369 --> 23:37.933
visited the campus. And there's a letter there. 
And in fact, then I saw the bill for the

23:39.836 --> 23:48.009
entertainment that he sent for his reimbursement 
to Buckwires. And they've taken Ray out to

23:48.229 --> 23:52.536
barbecue twice. somewhere else, I forget where, 
and then at your house, you know, several times,

23:53.242 --> 23:59.313
and he was there about a week, he and his wife. Is she 
still there? No, I don't think so, I don't know.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.127
I've never heard anything of her. I'll ask Gayla. 
Gayla really keeps in touch. I didn't know that.

24:11.454 --> 24:12.195
And Gayla's still there. She was a person. I was 
with Frank when he interviewed her. Is that right?

24:18.425 --> 24:21.290
I thought, oh my God, she's so young. Frank said, 
one look at her. That's it. His choice of people.

24:27.439 --> 24:28.561
Who is outstanding. That's incredible. You know, 
that's amazing for that press, that the people who

24:29.322 --> 24:32.508
come and stay. That's what makes it go through. 
That's very impressive. So those three, and then

24:39.952 --> 24:42.616
Don Collins comes in. And he's a wonderful guy, and 
he was. And Don is still around somewhere.

24:46.982 --> 24:47.703
Chicago. OK. It was the last I heard. Yeah, I 
probably should call him and talk to him in the

24:50.848 --> 24:55.415
phone or something. And then Noel came in about, 
what, 70, maybe even 77. I haven't really talked to

24:59.201 --> 25:02.045
him, but somewhere around there. But it was a small 
staff. Small staff? And I think he did four things

25:05.730 --> 25:07.613
this year? Four or six, I can't remember. Have you 
seen Elizabeth's job? Yes. No, I'm going. As soon

25:12.690 --> 25:15.472
as I leave here, I'm going to go see her. Yeah, she 
was quite close, being the first book, you know.

25:18.695 --> 25:20.657
Yeah, right, yeah. And I knew her. I had met her, and 
I liked the book. Yeah. It's a good book. So I'm

25:24.721 --> 25:29.306
anxious to visit with her. Now, Frank, you and 
Frank both, did you feel like that was a 24-hour

25:29.326 --> 25:34.731
interview? How did you feel about the work? It was a 
whole life. Just a lifestyle. A lifestyle that was

25:41.457 --> 25:44.721
so rare and wonderful. To any man who loves his work 
as much as Craig does his, it's just a wonderful

25:45.662 --> 25:54.231
thing to behold. Yeah. And I think that's the 
impression coming up with everybody that he

25:56.794 --> 26:02.760
encountered. And then when you can have a book in 
your hand to show for you, it's a wonderful thing.

26:08.209 --> 26:09.670
And it's pretty. He loved books. And Frank was so 
interested in everything. I still remember him

26:17.620 --> 26:20.964
telling me that he didn't like this. He was a hot 
lead man. Yeah, it's good he passed before. And in

26:26.991 --> 26:29.895
fact, that A&M history, that Centennial history I 
did, was printed at Taylor Printing Company. Oh,

26:32.582 --> 26:33.203
really? On their computers. And I, he, Frank, and 
Buckwires, and I went up there to tour the plant. I

26:40.972 --> 26:41.572
remember that. Yeah. And Frank was down there 
doing that computer stuff, you know. That's not

26:46.879 --> 26:50.343
real printing. Which I thought was fun and 
interesting.

26:55.669 --> 26:56.490
Were there any... big problems or encounters that 
you remember? I cannot remember any. I honestly

27:04.305 --> 27:06.268
can't. You block them out, okay. He needed his head 
tatted a little bit, you know, and he got it. He was

27:14.179 --> 27:16.943
the emperor of all, Mr. Ray. And he enjoyed it after 
being snubbed and snarled at here for so many

27:22.357 --> 27:24.819
years. That's what I get from Lindsey and Williams 
and Buck Wires. Now, Buck, did you know Buck Wires?

27:30.604 --> 27:35.008
Well, Buck had a bad stroke about four years ago. 
Oh, he's died. And he's done a lot of recovery and

27:36.770 --> 27:39.732
recuperation. And he said, frankly, Henry said, I 
have forgotten almost everything. But, he said, I

27:45.217 --> 27:46.658
do remember this. He said, if Frank wanted 
something, we've got it for him. Yes. And I think

27:51.584 --> 27:53.426
that's wrong. Complete respect and admiration. 
And after the deal went through here at UT, it was

27:56.508 --> 28:03.334
just fun. Well, that's good. That's a nice way to do 
it. Incidentally, I had a friend in South

28:10.641 --> 28:15.205
Carolina, University of South Carolina. I called 
him the other day because I needed the name of the

28:15.225 --> 28:20.730
guy who hired Frank. McKissick. That's South 
Carolina. McKissick. Was it McKissick? Okay,

28:25.054 --> 28:28.379
well, he told me Admiral Smith or something like 
that. Oh, maybe. That was in 1945. Now, McKissick

28:32.365 --> 28:36.191
was a professor of journalism, I believe. Okay, 
that would be right, too. Anyway, he wheeled and

28:38.855 --> 28:44.103
wheeled because Frank had, what, three semesters 
of college? Yes, yeah. And wow, suddenly it moved.

28:48.234 --> 28:52.384
Maybe 8,000 years.

28:52.425 --> 28:54.049
Speaking of that, there's a good comment. I can't 
remember if it was Webb. Maybe Webb. When Frank

28:59.823 --> 29:01.247
came to... Texas, I believe it was, when Frank 
recounted or something. Yeah, he said he didn't

29:05.520 --> 29:09.687
have any degrees, but he'd work on them in his spare 
time. Yes, and Webb said, don't bother. He said,

29:11.910 --> 29:16.578
what we don't need is somebody with a degree over 
here. And he went through a long ritual about,

29:16.998 --> 29:19.422
well, if you get a You know, the bachelor's degree, 
you don't have much. You have to get a master's. If

29:23.041 --> 29:28.407
you get a master's degree, then you have to go with a 
Ph.D. And if you get a Ph.D., it hasn't educated you

29:23.041 --> 29:28.407
at all. So you don't need that. Which I thought was 
neat. I've used that in the book. Frank always

29:34.834 --> 29:37.858
would feel that maybe he should have. He couldn't 
be. His daddy was a Presbyterian minister during

29:39.880 --> 29:44.925
the Depression. Mom, now, yeah. Frank was. Well, 
he was in the WPA. Yeah. And I think that salary

29:51.632 --> 29:53.835
was... CCC. CCC. And I think that was either $16 or 
$27 a month. I forget what it was. Mm-hmm. Which she

29:57.540 --> 29:58.401
sent home. One or the other. And half at least went 
home. Maybe all of it. That's right. So I can't

30:04.189 --> 30:07.113
imagine. But it's good that he, in my mind, it's 
good that he didn't get that degree because that

30:07.133 --> 30:13.863
would have cast him in another mode. Well, he had no 
trouble dogging on with AP. Now,

30:20.084 --> 30:27.316
any high points that you especially remember 
about your time at? Buck lived with us, and he was so

30:28.217 --> 30:33.566
wonderful. It was during his dry period, and he was 
very, very super sensitive. Like he would know

30:42.494 --> 30:47.000
when we wanted to be alone, and he would drift off. 
But he would eat his meals, and he was so fun. And

30:53.289 --> 30:54.952
they had been good friends before. Well, Frank had 
published his book here. But that was a bad time for

30:59.999 --> 31:03.364
Buck and I. And Frank was trying to help Buck. Yeah.

31:09.882 --> 31:13.209
And he really worked on it to get that book out of 
again. Oh, yeah. I remember a little of that. I

31:15.895 --> 31:16.215
remember that. We had quite a few books that read 
through the last of them. And when he came, he knew

31:23.551 --> 31:26.136
this was going to stay on.
