WEBVTT

00:04.402 --> 00:08.947
It was a designated area where a division size unit 
could go in and train. Flinders Range it was

00:09.007 --> 00:11.729
called. So we trained there and after that phase we 
were sent up to New Guinea. Yeah, that would make

00:18.176 --> 00:19.057
sense. But again, we were put into New Guinea at Oro 
Bay and still didn't have a mission. Is that

00:29.067 --> 00:30.008
December 43? That was December 43. I guess we got 
there in January. 44. 44. Okay, but let's not leave

00:34.883 --> 00:37.747
Australia yet. I'd like to ask a couple of 
questions. All right. I'd like to know about the

00:40.471 --> 00:51.385
relations between our allies, between the 
Australians, who are our allies, and the United

00:40.471 --> 00:51.385
States. First on the military level, did you train 
with the military? And then on the people level,

00:54.709 --> 00:57.793
what were your relations with the civilians? 
Well, that was another good experience. I guess I

01:02.452 --> 01:06.037
sound like to you that I never had any bad 
experiences. Maybe I just put those in the back of

01:06.758 --> 01:08.721
my mind. But as I told you earlier, in my 30 years in 
the Army, I never had a bad job. I'm only one son of a

01:15.570 --> 01:17.533
bitch boss. And that's true.

01:22.460 --> 01:24.202
The Australians were magnificent. They were 
delighted to see us come. The threat of the

01:28.088 --> 01:30.351
Japanese was very real. And they, today, We'll 
credit General MacArthur and his strategy and his

01:32.793 --> 01:44.470
troops with saving Australia from probably a

01:32.793 --> 01:44.470
devastating invasion by the Japanese. General 
MacArthur's as big a hero as Australia has from

01:46.553 --> 01:56.487
anywhere, including Australia, Australians.

01:57.308 --> 02:00.252
But now remember that when we got there, the vast 
bulk of the Australian Army was committed to

02:00.822 --> 02:07.892
Europe, actually to Africa. And so there weren't 
many Australian troops that we went into combat

02:07.912 --> 02:17.205
with. But of course we had the Army facilities 
there and support, and we had some of the troops go

02:29.560 --> 02:32.043
into the islands with us. The people, and they were 
magnificent soldiers. They were good soldiers.

02:34.766 --> 02:35.968
They were magnificent soldiers. Well-trained? 
Well-trained, and of course, in war, it's the

02:37.310 --> 02:47.522
motivation and the determination by the man and 
his team and his units and so forth that win.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.686
Training's important to it, but it's the will. 
Easy to work with. And they had the will, and

02:51.807 --> 02:54.811
there's no doubt about it. Was it easy to work with 
them? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. No problems with

02:57.835 --> 02:59.517
communications or anything? No, as a matter of 
fact, my comment and feeling was that the

02:59.851 --> 03:20.917
Australians were much more like Texans in their 
outlook and

02:59.851 --> 03:20.917
feelings and so forth than they were British. In 
other words, they've been very close allies of the

03:23.259 --> 03:27.585
British during all their years of existence. They 
were members of the Commonwealth and so forth. But

03:30.445 --> 03:36.012
really, they remind you very much of Texans, the 
one that I observed came to notice. In what way?

03:38.255 --> 03:41.340
They're very open. They're very frank.

03:45.405 --> 03:50.272
They're a little bit, I don't know, they're a 
little bit braggadocious.

03:52.615 --> 03:59.524
There are just several things about them that 
reminded me of that, you know, we had a lot more in

03:52.615 --> 03:59.524
common than they had in common with the British. 
And I say Texan because we're different, I think,

04:00.365 --> 04:06.033
than the rest, don't you? Now that you've been down 
here. You know, and the way we talk and our openness

04:08.597 --> 04:22.056
and frankness, sometimes it's called crudeness, 
depending on who's observing it and under what

04:08.597 --> 04:22.056
circumstances. So you had excellent relations 
with the armed

04:28.529 --> 04:34.676
No problem as far as any, throughout the war, no 
problems that you can remember? No episodes? Oh, I

04:36.257 --> 04:36.978
didn't. I know there were episodes. I, you know, 
individual episodes. But that's going to happen

04:42.825 --> 04:46.328
Saturday night in Coffman. Sure. Now, we have 
never experienced this on a large scale, but here

04:48.611 --> 04:57.861
was a case where the boys' and girls' pictures It 
was always real. Here were all these Yankees

05:01.320 --> 05:06.907
coming into Australia and most of the soldiers 
were gone to Europe, you know. So that created some

05:07.468 --> 05:09.751
frictions. But I must say that all the people in 
Australia, the civilians, whether they were

05:10.091 --> 05:25.631
government officials or heads of families or 
girls, and there weren't many young men available

05:10.091 --> 05:25.631
by God except in uniform. They were just like we 
were. They were just drafting everybody that was

05:29.279 --> 05:38.611
They

05:29.279 --> 05:38.611
were all very nice to us, and it wasn't just the 
girls falling for the Yanks. It was that we were

05:38.872 --> 05:41.215
just all very congenial. I know you read, I'm sure, 
that somebody's always going to write about the

05:43.317 --> 05:50.647
boy and girl situation. Any major problems as far 
as you were concerned with the boy and girl

05:52.129 --> 05:58.257
situation? In fact,

05:58.642 --> 06:06.389
we were very busy in Australia. I never really

06:06.609 --> 06:27.788
came to know Australian civilians of any kind 
until I was one of the lucky few that got a leave back

06:06.609 --> 06:27.788
from the islands a year later to go to Sydney on two 
weeks leave, recreation leave. And that's when I

06:28.122 --> 06:35.910
really, the only time that I, and it turned out I 
didn't get transportation back for another week,

06:28.122 --> 06:35.910
I guess it was. And Sydney's the main city. And 
that's the only time that I really was exposed to

06:39.474 --> 06:42.837
civilians.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.184
But there I was. I did get to know some of them. 20 
years later, 25 years later, the Australians put a

06:53.108 --> 06:57.673
few troops In Vietnam? Yes. Could you compare the 
troops in the 40s with those that they put in in the

07:02.016 --> 07:06.122
1960s? Only by reputation, because I was in 
Vietnam a year and a half, and I spent all of that

07:07.123 --> 07:15.974
time with the 1st Cavalry Division. And I never was 
close to the Australian units in there. But they

07:22.843 --> 07:24.505
were highly regarded. very highly regarded. They 
had a brigade in there, as I recall, a reinforced

07:26.197 --> 07:35.531
brigade, which is relatively small, or maybe they 
called it a regiment.

07:36.653 --> 07:39.358
But our troops respected them. They're very fine 
and courageous soldiers, and they're well

07:39.378 --> 07:45.467
trained. Now, of course, the difference is that To 
the best of my knowledge, Australia did not

07:50.911 --> 07:55.237
mobilize for the Vietnam War. So we were looking at 
the career soldiers, the professionals, rather

07:55.277 --> 08:05.012
than the World War II, everybody's in it. Now, the 
difference mainly is in age, average age. The

08:13.304 --> 08:18.792
average age of our World War II soldier was, I 
think, 20 and a half. every day looking at

08:19.396 --> 08:23.643
everybody in the Army, 21 maybe. Vietnam, it was 
just a little bit more, the average. That means

08:28.411 --> 08:39.830
that although we had more senior in years officers 
in grade and non-commissioned officers, still

08:28.411 --> 08:39.830
your buck was those youngsters. And remember, and 
I believe I'm correct, that we could, we drafted a

08:47.476 --> 08:53.903
drafted younger in Vietnam in World War

08:47.476 --> 08:53.903
II. Okay, then let's continue. You moved on to New 
Guinea in January of 1945 or 44. This

08:59.790 --> 09:04.896
had been a major front.

09:09.220 --> 09:16.048
New Guinea, at that time, they had won the big 
battle for

09:18.475 --> 09:19.396
What was the name of the mountain?

09:22.281 --> 09:32.176
That the Japanese were threatening to take that 
lower coast of New Guinea, which would have been

09:22.281 --> 09:32.176
very dangerous for the Australians. That battle 
was won. And so MacArthur was facing on up,

09:34.599 --> 09:42.331
figuring out how he was going to leapfrog through 
the island. And we sat there at New Guinea, really,

09:48.732 --> 09:50.894
until we went to the Admiralty Islands. The only 
mission we had other than training for those few

09:52.196 --> 10:03.749
weeks was, well actually a few months, was 
supporting the Marines on New Britain. And we'd

10:03.769 --> 10:17.305
actually load our trucks and our men with 
resupplies, ammunition mainly, and security

10:03.769 --> 10:17.305
troops onto Navy ships to go up and resupply the 
Marines in New Britain. And then one day, we got our

10:21.901 --> 10:43.191
first mission, and that was to go into the 
Admiralty Islands and seize Maumotiair Field,

10:21.901 --> 10:43.191
landing on Los Negros Island, and then expanding 
into Manus, the bigger island, the outlying

10:21.901 --> 10:43.191
islands, and cleaning them out of there. Now the 
Admiralty Island, you might recall, was just

10:43.576 --> 10:49.003
above New Britain, and that's sort of outflanking 
New Britain. New Britain had been a major base for

10:50.645 --> 10:53.368
the Japanese.

10:56.552 --> 11:00.517
And once we got in there, we then were busy from 
there on. We were one invasion after another.

11:02.860 --> 11:07.065
After we cleaned up there, then we went on up to— 
Okay, when did you land there? We landed there in

11:08.207 --> 11:13.093
March— March of 44. What were your feelings about 
going into combat? Probably typical. I guess the

11:20.475 --> 11:29.748
main feeling was, are we going to be good enough to 
get this done quickly and successfully?

11:32.072 --> 11:41.125
And, of course, you always,

11:32.072 --> 11:41.125
aside from winning, or in addition to winning, you 
always want to keep the casualties low. And I must

11:41.145 --> 11:42.507
say that... While General MacArthur's influence 
was not direct, I do credit him by virtue of the

11:43.550 --> 11:56.829
strategies he followed and the targets he 
selected for invasion, the objectives he

11:43.550 --> 11:56.829
selected. I've always credited him with keeping 
casualties to a minimum in the Pacific. Now, that

12:03.940 --> 12:08.727
wasn't all for humanistic reasons. The fact was 
that he was second in line for replacements.

12:19.131 --> 12:25.017
And if he took severe casualties, he didn't know 
when he might get them replaced. So it was a

12:25.037 --> 12:31.923
two-sided consideration.

12:31.943 --> 12:34.625
Did you ever have an opportunity to meet the 
general? I never shook his hand. I saw him several

12:39.250 --> 12:42.953
times because he was he was uh that was a kind of a war 
that the general couldn't visit every outfit

12:44.755 --> 13:10.527
every week but when we uh because you know we were 
all over the map but uh when he committed us to an

12:44.755 --> 13:10.527
operation he was always there the day we landed or 
the day after i'll never forget you've seen the

13:12.110 --> 13:30.273
famous photograph of General MacArthur coming 
ashore and saying, I have returned, and it was on

13:12.110 --> 13:30.273
Lady Island, and I did not see that coming ashore, 
but I saw him the next morning, and it was rather

13:12.110 --> 13:30.273
interesting how that happened.

13:33.317 --> 13:39.905
I don't know, there were four divisions in the 
assault in that landing on Lady. Our first cavalry

13:39.925 --> 13:41.627
division was the Northern was the capital city of 
Tacloban of the Isle of the Lady

13:43.784 --> 14:12.188
I don't know how many landing craft the large ones 
you know that put their ramps down and the vehicles

13:43.784 --> 14:12.188
come off LSTs I don't know how many we had in that 
line and that was a beautiful beach but for some

13:43.784 --> 14:12.188
reason

13:43.784 --> 14:12.188
we hit a sandbar about 100 feet from shore, and they 
could not get that ship over that sandbar. All the

14:20.405 --> 14:24.249
rest of them, right on the right, right on the left, 
were right up hugging the beach. The squadron

14:26.492 --> 14:33.900
commander was aboard that ship, and he would not 
replace it anywhere else. Well, I guess he

14:33.920 --> 14:35.522
couldn't. There was no other place to put it. So we 
unloaded that ship through that water. Every

14:41.648 --> 14:43.170
vehicle, every gun, Every soldier went through 
that blame. How deep was it? Well, it was about

14:48.428 --> 14:55.395
chest deep to a man at the average tide, the high 
tide. But anyway, it took us all night to get our

14:56.596 --> 14:59.899
ship unloaded. The first thing we got out, of 
course, were our guns, and they went into action,

14:59.919 --> 15:05.865
the 105 howitzers.

15:08.627 --> 15:13.512
And next morning, having just completed this, my 
unit. I was executive officer, number two, second

15:15.787 --> 15:19.490
in command of that battalion. The battalion 
command went forward with it, and I unloaded the

15:19.550 --> 15:32.363
ship, and we'd sent all the vehicles forward in 
just a few hundred yards in there, and so I decided I

15:19.550 --> 15:32.363
was going to walk. Hadn't slept a wink all night, 
and there was a trail there, a little road that went

15:32.403 --> 15:39.990
down there. Well, I just turned off the beach 
walking up that road and I heard the two jeep's

15:43.006 --> 16:12.827
horns all of a sudden sounding look around and here 
was Joe MacArthur and his staff coming in to take a

15:43.006 --> 16:12.827
look at what was being done and I had the greatest 
admiration and respect for him but I I really

15:43.006 --> 16:12.827
wasn't impressed I was so dang tired I could hardly 
walk down that road but anyway typically he went on

16:13.786 --> 16:40.249
forward, and every time he visited our division, 
our division commander would be nervous because

16:13.786 --> 16:40.249
General MacArthur wanted to be right up there, 
right up there where the front forward shooting's

16:13.786 --> 16:40.249
going on, you know, and you always worry about, he 
didn't, but the responsible commander, whether

16:13.786 --> 16:40.249
it be the division commander and the regimental 
commander and right on down were very much

16:13.786 --> 16:40.249
concerned with him, but he was good in that regard 
of having absolutely no

16:41.225 --> 16:57.061
regard for his personal safety, which is to some 
extent a disregard for the comfort of his

16:41.225 --> 16:57.061
subordinates, but he let the men know that he was a 
part of that war. I guess that's the closest I was

16:57.401 --> 17:09.814
ever to him, but he didn't have to be present to be 
respected because he had a way of projecting his

17:10.587 --> 17:19.337
command influence right down to the last soldier, 
I thought. Let's go back to your very first

17:19.357 --> 17:23.442
invasion. Tell me about it. How'd it go? Well, it 
went very successfully. We did have a lot of

17:28.568 --> 17:31.892
casualties in the first squadron. See, the 
Calvary designation is troop instead of company.

17:37.655 --> 17:43.202
squadron instead of battalion, and then your 
regiment terms, the rest of them were the same. The

17:43.222 --> 17:52.973
reinforced squadron went in initially, and 
before the next squadron landed, they took very

17:43.222 --> 17:52.973
heavy cavalry, but they just really— Right on the 
beach? No, they got off the beach. In fact, they

17:56.057 --> 18:02.704
were very successful because of the surprise of 
getting ashore, and of course that's the most

17:56.057 --> 18:02.704
important thing. And what time was it? Did you 
launch the attack? You know, I don't remember. I

18:08.998 --> 18:12.944
wasn't in that initial assault. That was the first 
brigade. My brigade, the second brigade that I was

18:14.546 --> 18:25.401
with, came, as a matter of fact, several days later 
because the mission of that squadron was a

18:14.546 --> 18:25.401
reconnaissance in force, if that means anything 
to you. No, what does that mean? That means go in

18:27.945 --> 18:37.378
there and find out what's there and be prepared to 
pull off after you determine it and come back.

18:41.020 --> 18:50.635
Well, this was a squadron of about 500 men with 
Brigadier General Chase in command. He was

18:50.715 --> 18:53.819
commander of the 1st Brigade. Squadron 
commander, Colonel Lobet. But they did a

18:58.607 --> 19:00.289
beautiful job. And when MacArthur came ashore, 
and they got ashore so beautifully, withstood

19:00.369 --> 19:08.682
that initial counterattack so well. That's when 
they took most of those casualties after the

19:10.530 --> 19:16.159
Japanese had time to react. General MacArthur 
came ashore and said, hold on. We're going to just

19:22.929 --> 19:32.304
stay here and clear up this whole series of islands 
and we'll send you reinforcements. So then they

19:32.324 --> 19:37.251
sent the rest of the division in. Now, our 
particular... So you went in with artillery? I

19:41.842 --> 20:01.344
went in with the 2nd Brigade, with the 6th 1st Field 
Artillery Battalion, and we had the 8th Regiment

19:41.842 --> 20:01.344
in that assault, the 8th Regiment of Cavalry, and

19:41.842 --> 20:01.344
the 7th. But now we went in on the opposite side of 
the island, These first assaults, well, it was

20:08.956 --> 20:22.552
mainly to envelop the enemy that remained there, 
take the pressure off of the 5th Cavalry.

20:27.038 --> 20:37.410
And then coming in, there was one, there were two 
little islands, there was a ring of islands that

20:27.038 --> 20:37.410
joined, hooked up Los Negros Island with the main 
island of Manus, almost hooked it up. It was very

20:42.054 --> 20:43.255
open on the end. We came in between the first and 
second island, away from Los Negros.

20:52.223 --> 20:53.264
No problem. Very narrow channel there between 
those two.

20:58.349 --> 21:04.454
And the cavalry assaulted. We came ashore and set 
up to support artillery. It was just a short time

21:09.537 --> 21:17.143
and not very heavy fighting before the two forces 
joined up. And so then it was a matter of simply

21:18.204 --> 21:34.158
consolidating on Los Negros and then after that 
the division operated to clean up Los Negros

21:18.204 --> 21:34.158
Island, this string of islands, and then later go 
on to the big Manus Island. Now Manus Island became

21:34.178 --> 21:39.122
a major neighbor base after we took it. In fact, I 
guess that was the biggest naval base away from

21:40.435 --> 21:50.067
Hawaii and away from the United States.

21:50.167 --> 22:06.808
One little interesting detail,

21:50.167 --> 22:06.808
we later occupied the island that was on our right 
as we came in that channel for that invasion.

22:06.828 --> 22:09.632
And as a matter of fact, we set our battalion up in 
positions there to support the assault on Manus

22:10.237 --> 22:15.381
Island, the big island. Where the airfield was 
stationed. Well, the airfield was on Los Negros,

22:17.803 --> 22:24.189
but the naval base was built. There was a beautiful 
harbor there, Seattle Harbor. The Japs had a minor

22:29.213 --> 22:33.737
little naval facility there, but it became a major 
U.S. naval base. Anyway, once we got on that

22:33.757 --> 22:38.701
island, that tip that we passed by had two naval 
guns on it. Nobody saw when we went in there. And

22:41.168 --> 22:43.291
nobody fired at you? And nobody fired at us. Oh, 
why? Were the Japanese? I'll never know because,

22:46.675 --> 22:54.145
of course, we had to invade that little island and 
there were Japanese on it, but not a lot. Were they

22:54.225 --> 22:55.346
out of ammunition? No. We had one of them shooting. 
Our

22:58.170 --> 23:07.762
executive officer, our service battery, had one 
of those guns shooting within two hours after we

22:58.170 --> 23:07.762
got on there. And we shot their ammunition. over in 
support of our troops. Why they shot, I'm sure, why

23:13.199 --> 23:22.290
they didn't shoot when we came in there, 
obviously, our headquarters had reason to order

23:13.199 --> 23:22.290
them not to. I don't know what it was. What about 
that airstrip? Did you have any problems taking

23:30.660 --> 23:31.922
it? Were there any airplanes there?

23:37.228 --> 23:38.209
No, there were no problems. No airplanes by that 
time? Had they been destroyed by our—? There were

23:42.600 --> 23:43.721
no airplanes there. The only problem resulted in 
the Japs trying to counterattack and trying to

23:45.884 --> 23:58.521
take it back,

23:45.884 --> 23:58.521
trying to knock our troops off. But it was put into 
operation very promptly. The usual pattern was

24:01.144 --> 24:08.854
they'd send a CB's unit in there, you know, and get 
it going. And they'd build a steel-reinforced

24:09.830 --> 24:16.300
runway?

24:16.320 --> 24:23.991
You know, I believe it was, I don't recall whether 
that was rebuilt. Now, we had to improve it, but

24:24.132 --> 24:29.760
later we were running B-24s off of it, so it had to be 
improved considerably. But whether it was

24:30.962 --> 24:35.629
concrete or asphalt, I'm not sure. I just don't 
remember. Because they had those big steel planks

24:39.732 --> 24:43.077
that they used to put together. I'm

24:43.137 --> 24:47.304
sure we used that. I think probably what it was was a 
light asphalt with those,

24:47.945 --> 24:57.640
what do we call those steel, they had a name. By the 
inventor's name, I guess it was. Perforated

25:01.866 --> 25:03.950
steel. In other words, in your first assault, you 
didn't take very many casualties. Looking at the

25:08.740 --> 25:11.864
division as a whole, no. In that initial squadron, 
they took quite a few. But not in yours. What were

25:18.111 --> 25:22.896
your feelings after you landed, after you 
realized that you made it? Well, I think we all felt

25:24.798 --> 25:34.850
this is the first test, and we passed it, and we had a 
lot of confidence, self-confidence, a lot of

25:24.798 --> 25:34.850
confidence in our units. This thing, of course, 
The ugly part of these campaigns come in the

25:39.149 --> 25:46.018
so-called cleaning them out, cleanup 
operations. And were there many on this island?

25:50.564 --> 25:51.746
Were there many cleanup operations? Yes, there 
were, because most of the troops, after they

25:51.766 --> 26:08.127
failed in that counterattack, tried to pull back 
and evade

25:51.766 --> 26:08.127
our attacks. But they still were good at setting up 
ambushes, and occasionally we'd hit a tough

26:09.473 --> 26:17.062
position where they were ordered to stand. There 
weren't an awful lot of them there. It's just

26:20.405 --> 26:33.921
tedious doing it, and it's such a sweaty, tough 
hacking job through that jungle for those guys

26:20.405 --> 26:33.921
that have to go up there and be the forward troops in 
it. Our job was to try to

26:41.266 --> 26:49.558
kill as many Japanese and dominate much terrain 
with firepower and save as many lives and as much

26:41.266 --> 26:49.558
sweat as we could. Eventually, of course, the 
infantry's got to take it, but there was a lot of

26:50.859 --> 27:04.419
satisfaction being a direct support 
artilleryman because that team became so close

26:50.859 --> 27:04.419
and those troops relied so much on us. And I never 
saw such greater dedication to anything than the

27:04.439 --> 27:11.188
typical our tournament realizing they're 
dependent on us we're here because of them you know

27:12.620 --> 27:37.294
then they're very effective and firepower we can 
get into greater discussions on this but we in this

27:12.620 --> 27:37.294
nation have been fortunate to have the means to 
afford sure vast superiority in firepower That

27:38.759 --> 27:46.470
has saved us more lives than strategy or good 
tactics or anything else, in my opinion. But, of

27:46.490 --> 27:47.652
course, I'm heavily oriented. Not just 
artillery, but air support, naval support, the

27:47.692 --> 27:52.078
whole thing. We used a lot of naval support in World 
War II in the Pacific and relied upon it. That was

27:58.767 --> 28:05.577
our long-range artillery that in Europe would 
have been in the form of Corps and Army artillery.

28:05.928 --> 28:15.541
Our Corps Army artillery was pretty scarce the way 
we operated in the Pacific in those years.

28:18.184 --> 28:24.473
So as far as casualties were concerned, the 
infantry took the run in the casualties and not the

28:18.184 --> 28:24.473
artillery. The artillery in that war was not 
subjected to the casualty means that our people in

28:24.493 --> 28:33.184
Europe were. the Japanese very seldom brought 
artillery to bear on us. And we, the artillery on

28:39.395 --> 28:48.365
our side, is the first target of the artillery of 
the enemy because we're so effective with ours.

28:50.327 --> 28:54.451
Okay, well then let's go on to the next campaign. 
This lasted from March 1944 until about when did

28:55.753 --> 28:59.897
you? We invaded Lady Island in October. in October

29:03.910 --> 29:08.935
of 1944. Right, and at Lady Golf were you part of the 
naval battle which was the largest naval battle of

29:09.335 --> 29:17.382
the Second World War? We were very much aware of it. 
Were you out on a ship? No, we were ashore at the

29:21.866 --> 29:24.008
time. You see this naval battle occurred several 
days after we got ashore and after we'd assaulted

29:24.028 --> 29:32.736
the island of Lady. And we were inland, I would say, 
we were several miles inland when this battle

29:34.218 --> 29:41.089
occurred. The first sign to us was that our 
division headquarters ceased to send naval

29:41.950 --> 29:49.843
intelligence down to us. And we routinely, the 
Navy would send the Army its intelligence. It

29:57.254 --> 30:02.082
would send in basically where the main elements of 
the fleet were, and intelligence on the enemy, and

30:03.867 --> 30:09.017
that just stopped. Well, I guess initially nobody 
thought much about it. Then we started getting

30:15.090 --> 30:19.018
propaganda leaflets. The airplanes would, the 
jet planes would started showing up. And they'd

30:25.292 --> 30:26.753
fly over and drop leaflets? In some numbers. And 
that's the first time that had ever happened to us.

30:30.336 --> 30:40.686
Well, of course, we realized that we went up there 
without any land-based aircraft, no Air Force

30:30.336 --> 30:40.686
support, because we had to get that airfield at 
Tacloban before they could come in. We had only

30:42.288 --> 30:43.969
Navy carrier support. And the main thing we wanted 
them to do was keep those Jap airplanes off of us and

30:45.231 --> 30:52.598
provide close air support. Sure. So, yes, they 
dropped during the early stages of that battle, as

30:53.935 --> 31:03.229
it turned out, they dropped leaflets. I remember 
one of General MacArthur's statements of his

31:03.309 --> 31:20.955
strategy was that he would leapfrog back to the 
Philippines and leave many of the Japanese

31:03.309 --> 31:20.955
unchallenged Japanese formations. But it leads 
them to wither on the vine. You remember reading

31:24.043 --> 31:25.164
that? Well, they dropped leaflets saying we were 
going to wither on the vine. Well, it was never very

31:31.872 --> 31:39.180
seriously taken, but it did alert us to the fact 
that they were going to try to pull something off.

31:41.964 --> 31:51.955
But the real evidence of the battle and that it was 
not all in our favor came when the

31:41.964 --> 31:51.955
US Naval aircraft came into the Tacloban strip to 
land because it didn't have a carrier to land on.

31:58.166 --> 32:02.691
And I mean, they were stacking in there and some of 
them were shot up and crash landing. It was a mess.

32:06.095 --> 32:09.238
But also, most of them, of course, got down safely. 
But they had, I really, I don't suppose I ever knew

32:09.659 --> 32:14.664
how many. But later, it was clear that a number of 
those carriers had been disabled. And we had a heck

32:22.546 --> 32:26.732
of a lot of aircraft on that airfield just after he 
was taken. It wasn't ready for him. Of course, you

32:28.835 --> 32:31.279
can land a Navy plane on a dime, practically. So 
then we were aware

32:32.360 --> 32:41.193
and then started getting information that there 
was a serious naval battle. But we were not

32:41.213 --> 32:50.106
informed on how it went or how the opposing forces 
deployed or anything until it was over. I'll say

32:52.145 --> 32:52.886
this.

32:56.350 --> 32:56.991
I say we. I think this was a typical outlook. We had 
so much confidence in the U.S. Navy, even though

33:00.415 --> 33:15.715
they were a little bit short in MacArthur's 
territory because, you know, so much of the Navy

33:00.415 --> 33:15.715
was roaming the vast areas of the sea toward Japan. 
But we had such confidence in them that we really

33:16.736 --> 33:21.662
weren't worried about it too much.

33:23.920 --> 33:31.988
one scene there before the naval battle showed up 
that tends to give you confidence. The enemy did

33:32.008 --> 33:44.602
make an effort to bomb our beach, our ships on the 
beach and to bomb our troop formations right after

33:32.008 --> 33:44.602
we landed and assaulted and for the next few days 
before this battle started.

33:47.505 --> 33:53.691
I remember I was marching the battalion down a road 
moving position and this whole formation of

33:53.941 --> 34:10.805
Japanese bombers and fighters approached and six 
little Navy Hellcats flew in and one by one just

33:53.941 --> 34:10.805
knocked them down. It just looked like a shooting 
gallery. Really? It was the most amazing piece of

34:13.168 --> 34:18.936
air action that I saw in the whole war. Six of them. 
They couldn't defend themselves? They couldn't

34:23.287 --> 34:26.451
match those. The Zero fighter, they had a few to 
protect that bunch of bombers. It never got to that

34:31.358 --> 34:34.102
beach area, by the way.

34:37.066 --> 34:48.822
There was nothing wrong with the Zero for 
maneuverability and so forth as a fighter, but our

34:37.066 --> 34:48.822
people just must have been better, a lot better. 
And they knocked... I forget how many planes were

34:51.400 --> 34:57.710
in that formation, but I'm talking about probably 
12 or 16, something like that. Well, you know, we

34:59.433 --> 35:06.364
just stood there admiring

34:59.433 --> 35:06.364
this. We just stopped to watch it. Did you cheer? 
Oh, yeah. You thought it was a football game. You'd

35:16.820 --> 35:19.264
hear the troops.

35:22.231 --> 35:33.906
But anyway, everything the Navy had done, they 
were in such close support of us all the way from

35:22.231 --> 35:33.906
Australia, including training in Australia. We 
had great confidence. We never realized how

35:35.308 --> 35:41.956
serious that battle was until it was all over. And 
the Navy had acquitted itself beautifully. By

35:47.163 --> 35:50.467
this time, the Japanese were starting to use the 
Kamikazes. Did you hear anything about them? The

35:53.315 --> 36:05.868
kamikazes, we heard about them, but

35:53.315 --> 36:05.868
they were not a big factor in our operation down in 
the Philippines. Where they became real serious

36:05.988 --> 36:13.916
was when we were approaching Japan more closely, 
say Okinawa and Saipan and so forth. Then is when

36:13.936 --> 36:19.542
they really, as I recall, came into play. And you 
can't criticize the people for that kamikaze

36:21.547 --> 36:41.655
outlook

36:21.547 --> 36:41.655
in a way you admire them, but of course the 
difference in the way we would do it and the way they

36:21.547 --> 36:41.655
did it, we put more value on the human life than they 
did. As far as wasting the airplanes is concerned,

36:42.115 --> 36:49.866
my gosh, look what we do when we send a missile off 
now.

36:51.128 --> 36:52.049
cost of money. That doesn't bother us, it's the 
life that bothers us. Now what were some of the

36:57.358 --> 37:01.605
problems that lay to you, military problems?

37:06.072 --> 37:15.567
Well, I'm not sure I can give you a good critique, 
but I can give you, from my small point of view, I was

37:18.145 --> 37:26.776
second in command of a battalion, which means that 
our battalion was in direct support of a cavalry

37:18.145 --> 37:26.776
regiment. Usually it was the 8th Cavalry 
Regiment.

37:31.301 --> 37:46.920
We tied into the division artillery 
headquarters, which was the fire support

37:31.301 --> 37:46.920
coordination headquarters for the entire 
division, whether it be artillery or naval

37:31.301 --> 37:46.920
gunfire close air support. So the artillery did 
have good communication and information on

37:49.834 --> 37:54.541
what's going on. So I could still visualize what's 
going on a little further away than my own outfit.

38:04.234 --> 38:13.347
The biggest problem in the later campaign was 
terrain, and that's often the case in war. And

38:15.284 --> 38:17.327
later we'll get into the 1st Cavalry Division. 
There's an air mobile, air assault, helicopter

38:17.367 --> 38:24.255
maneuvered division, which freed us from the 
terrain. There was a very poor road system in

38:26.538 --> 38:29.682
Laney. And of course, we were there in the rainy 
season. Getting from point A to point B, quite

38:36.290 --> 38:45.021
apart from maneuver required, was a problem. The 
prime mover for our 105 Howitzers and Arbitatins

38:46.857 --> 38:59.415
and the others, too, was a little Caterpillar 
tractor. The vehicle for carrying cargo, such as

38:59.435 --> 39:14.637
ammunition and supplies, was the one-ton trailer 
hooked behind Caterpillar tractors.

39:16.355 --> 39:24.224
battery-sized unit had a little Caterpillar 
tractor with a bulldozer blade on it, a bulldozer.

39:24.244 --> 39:26.326
And that's how we licked the terrain. Gee whiz. And 
you really couldn't move large numbers of wheeled

39:27.648 --> 39:43.425
vehicles until the rains let up, you know, after 
you'd had a certain amount of it. until some of the

39:44.806 --> 39:46.488
roads were improved. Of course, that was too vast 
an undertaking to support an operation in motion.

39:52.254 --> 39:57.380
So I would say the terrain was the major problem.

39:58.882 --> 40:00.123
How did you move your artillery? Pulled it with the 
caterpillar tractors. We could go anywhere with

40:04.268 --> 40:10.054
those caterpillar tractors, with a bulldozer to 
help.

40:12.920 --> 40:21.832
I don't think we had any real serious problems

40:12.920 --> 40:21.832
in accomplishing our missions other than the 
terrain. I think one of our great challenges, and

40:22.773 --> 40:32.325
this is always a challenge in war and a much sought 
after area of advantage, was intelligence. But

40:33.507 --> 40:37.392
that was a problem from the word go with the 
Japanese because it was just a very difficult

40:37.574 --> 40:40.177
thing to take a prisoner. And that's your best 
source of intelligence. And their discipline was

40:41.939 --> 40:43.201
good. Ordinarily, you'll get, and we did get some, 
but you'd get documents off the bodies of

40:44.963 --> 40:55.396
casualties, enemy casualties. But

40:56.858 --> 41:01.624
the prisoner was denied us. The general denied 
your observation. And in those days, we didn't

41:05.128 --> 41:07.311
have this Marvelous electronic means of 
intelligence now, literally listening to the

41:07.763 --> 41:15.451
enemy. So I'd say that was the greatest challenge. 
Did you take any Japanese prisoners? Some. Did

41:24.039 --> 41:24.940
they ever talk? Not many, and not many who really 
knew much.

41:30.926 --> 41:37.753
I recall that going back to our first operation, 
our division commander, every commander wants

41:38.662 --> 41:57.759
became so upset that he wasn't getting any 
prisoners that he personally went to every

41:38.662 --> 41:57.759
battalion commander deployed and ordered him, 
get me a prisoner. Most of them got him one. But this

42:00.542 --> 42:07.588
wasn't so much that we were not going to take 
prisoners. It wasn't our rules. It was the

42:11.107 --> 42:13.351
Japanese rules in two forms. One, they had fought 
the war, and we'd been told this by everybody, the

42:13.671 --> 42:25.630
Marines, and everybody else had been exposed to 
them, that they're going to fight until they die.

42:27.012 --> 42:36.647
And I believe this, that it was said, and I believe 
it, that they were ordered, if they didn't die

42:27.012 --> 42:36.647
fighting, that they commit suicide. And we know 
that a number of them did that.

42:44.292 --> 42:48.598
So it just resulted in bursting in casualties. 
There weren't many that you could get your hands on

42:48.758 --> 42:51.703
in the first place. And when your enemy is going to 
fight to the death, you're probably going to kill

42:52.524 --> 43:05.503
him, because you're probably going to have to kill 
him before you can get your hands on him.

43:06.597 --> 43:13.224
I guess we were as brutal as they were, but it was not 
abolition, is what I'm saying.

43:16.067 --> 43:18.830
And did any of your men become their prisoners?

43:24.376 --> 43:35.288
There was only one known incident where we had some 
people taken prisoners.

43:35.538 --> 43:39.863
our own troops, and this was a matter of them being 
overrun.

43:42.847 --> 43:51.377
Many of our soldiers said they'd save the last 
bullet for themselves, but I think when you get in

43:42.847 --> 43:51.377
the heat of the battle, it's just not very likely. 
But in that particular incident, we recovered the

43:53.960 --> 44:02.710
soldiers, but they were all dead but one, and they 
were recovered by immediate counterattack.

44:03.331 --> 44:03.992
Maybe it doesn't make since, and the higher 
commander never ordered it. But if anybody got

44:09.668 --> 44:26.488
trapped, you know, if you had to fall back or if you 
got pushed off to the flank and somebody wasn't

44:09.668 --> 44:26.488
counted for, the local commander, if he had the 
strength, he would just automatically

44:09.668 --> 44:26.488
counterattack to go get that man. It was just sort 
of a, what is it, an unwritten practice.

44:34.550 --> 44:35.652
I admired them for that. Probably cost more 
casualties. Maybe it doesn't, you know, maybe it

44:39.658 --> 44:45.546
doesn't make much sense, but that's the way they 
did it. That's the only case that I know where we

44:45.566 --> 44:50.133
lost prisoners. And then the Japanese murder. But 
the Japanese murder, except one was not killed.

44:57.043 --> 44:59.367
Why wasn't he killed? Well, he'd been wounded. Oh. 
They thought, I guess they'd done him in, but Was

45:05.262 --> 45:07.245
there a lot of hatred then? Oh yes, of course.

45:13.294 --> 45:14.616
That was the nature of that war. And I must say that 
our people all hated the North Vietnamese almost

45:15.958 --> 45:22.567
as much. You hate all your enemies when you're 
about to kill each other. Sure. There's no other

45:28.756 --> 45:32.181
way.

45:33.595 --> 45:42.829
so-called gentleman's war that was fought in 
Europe, I doubt if you were to find yourself in the

45:33.595 --> 45:42.829
company on the front line that you'd see much 
gentlemanly about it. The generals can be

45:45.353 --> 45:57.071
courteous and all that, but not the guys up there 
that got a beat on each other.

45:57.091 --> 45:58.133
It's 5.15. Do you want to take a break? Okay.
