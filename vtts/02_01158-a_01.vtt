WEBVTT

00:01.178 --> 00:07.986
But Sunday, last Sunday, and get stuff from all... 
See, we have a veterinarian that's a good

00:01.178 --> 00:07.986
ophthalmologist. He's an ophthalmologist 
specialist. So we have quite a few... Last July. We

00:15.296 --> 00:19.341
have a good overall picture of specialization. We 
have a radiologist. We have some people I get

00:22.705 --> 00:24.347
literature from. Radiologists. You know, one of 
the big problems is that and I don't know the answer

00:30.541 --> 00:47.738
to it totally, is that veterinarians have had to, 
maybe by necessity, but also probably because of

00:30.541 --> 00:47.738
their own conservative nature and design, be 
their own PR. And so it's just like I've been on the

00:49.520 --> 00:56.987
public relation committees of the local 
association and the state association. for on and

00:57.929 --> 01:26.029
off for the last 25 years and they get together and 
they have lots of good ideas but they don't really

00:57.929 --> 01:26.029
know you know it's like a lawyer trying to defend 
himself they really don't know what they're doing

00:57.929 --> 01:26.029
you know if really a lot of stuff could be gotten in 
the media both electronic media and print media if

00:57.929 --> 01:26.029
but you've got to you can't just go down and say look 
we'd like to have something on about veterinary

00:57.929 --> 01:26.029
medicine or send them a letter we'd like to have 
something on about veterinary medicine You've

01:26.330 --> 01:29.916
got to go down there and make a presentation. 
Here's what we can give you. Here are the subjects.

01:33.703 --> 01:35.566
Here's the guy that's going to present it. Tom, you 
know what Bernie and I used to say? Excuse me,

01:37.529 --> 01:38.911
Bernie. We told each other this a dozen times, one 
of my large animal exporters. We'd say, you idiot,

01:42.698 --> 01:45.803
you're too busy working to be a good businessman. 
Well, that's true. And that's it. Yeah. You really

01:49.955 --> 01:50.736
are. That's exactly right. James Herriot's done 
more for veterinary public relations and all the

01:53.599 --> 02:00.826
organized veterinary societies since the eons of 
time. That's right. He really has. But you know,

02:03.568 --> 02:10.656
your experience on that TV station is really a good 
indicator because people love animals and they

02:03.568 --> 02:10.656
like people who like animals. And all you need to do 
is make people know you're out there. Quite

02:12.958 --> 02:18.223
frankly, if I wanted to, I could be on television at 
least once a month or twice a month. Because I've

02:21.210 --> 02:27.616
got probably 150 two-minute television 
vignettes that I've written and done. And I have

02:28.477 --> 02:30.839
subject material and all that. I tried to get the 
state association several years ago. I told them

02:34.483 --> 02:47.535
that if they would hire somebody to take all my 
television tapes and radio tapes and to put them

02:34.483 --> 02:47.535
together and edit them and then with a list of 
subject material, then they could send that out to

02:47.802 --> 02:54.550
local veterinary associations and say, here's a 
how-to kit to approach your media. You can look at

02:54.930 --> 03:09.426
these, see how your formats are, have a whole bunch 
of subject material, and if they went to their

02:54.930 --> 03:09.426
local television or radio station and said, look, 
we'd like to get this on, here's a whole bunch of

02:54.930 --> 03:09.426
subjects that our people can talk about. And it 
would come under the Animal Public Service. Jim

03:13.571 --> 03:14.712
Humphreys did this. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and he was very 
successful in Dallas. Well, we're approaching

03:19.138 --> 03:21.930
it, but like I say, we have a long ways to go. We need 
to hang. Every time we get an opportunity, Like I

03:24.809 --> 03:29.355
was talking about, to get our foot in the door or to 
do this, it helps to spend their money. But

03:29.395 --> 03:32.559
veterinarians get together and they get all 
pumped up and say, oh, we can do this. And it's like

03:32.679 --> 03:36.363
Philip Martin with the little article in the 
paper. He loses his mind trying to get people,

03:36.403 --> 03:40.428
veterinarians, to contribute. It's in there 
every day. And finally, I suggest that he came and

03:42.030 --> 03:46.816
got all my radio tapes because people call and ask 
questions. I said, this will certainly give you

03:46.836 --> 03:51.782
all the questions you ever want to write about. I'm 
trying to write a book. Are you? But to get

03:54.239 --> 04:06.715
veterinarians to do this, you know, to get 
veterinarians to do this, I mean, you get somebody

03:54.239 --> 04:06.715
pumped up, somebody writes one or two, and then 
they forget about it, and they go on, and then the

03:54.239 --> 04:06.715
whole movement just kind of sags and dies, you 
know. I have some experiences, I think. I lived in

04:08.998 --> 04:10.220
Mexico for years. I've done zoo work, exotic work, 
ranch work. I have 50 articles, pictures, notes of

04:13.564 --> 04:19.192
true animal adventure experiences. Some of them 
are real comical. I write very factual articles. I

04:23.163 --> 04:23.924
have some with me. I have a lot of them that hold 
pictures. I've written UTSA Press, A&M Press,

04:26.106 --> 04:33.013
sent them two or three articles that I've finished 
that are true adventure. But I write factual, you

04:33.033 --> 04:34.915
know. Yeah. Joe Blow or Capstick could write them 
up and make them tremendously interesting. Yeah.

04:41.762 --> 04:43.563
I hope you'll pass a few of those along. Well, I tell 
you, I was wondering, I was just thinking, I said, I

04:43.603 --> 04:51.111
don't know if this gentleman is interested in, you 
know, but... No, I want some good stories, good

04:43.603 --> 04:51.111
videos. Well, I have some stuff. I know it's 
interesting because I get in a party some days and

04:52.829 --> 04:58.216
get talking to somebody, and we talk for an hour. 
But I have written and rewritten and rewritten,

04:59.017 --> 05:04.324
and I have two or three finished. I thought a writer 
just wrote it one time, and that was it. That's it. I

05:07.529 --> 05:15.820
think all of us, if we've read Harriet's books, and 
I know I did when I was reading his books. I found

05:16.140 --> 05:22.228
myself, and I started off as a large animal, 
interested in large animals in a small Indiana

05:16.140 --> 05:22.228
town. You know, I was out one time when I was, in 
fact, I was a senior student that's been there and

05:22.597 --> 05:33.029
left town, and I kind of looked after his practice 
while he was gone. He was going to be gone two weeks,

05:33.049 --> 05:45.043
and I had a call, and, you know, first calf, heifer 
calving, and out in the crop shed in the middle of

05:33.049 --> 05:45.043
the night, and the old farmer told me, he said, 
well, I think you can do it, you know, and I, I was

05:45.243 --> 05:48.187
there struggling trying to get that calf turned 
around. I just finished reading that. Yeah, yeah,

05:49.789 --> 05:55.997
and he was standing there saying, well, Dr. Turner 
do this, well, Dr. Turner, I mean, it was exactly

05:49.789 --> 05:55.997
like that. He had that calf on there. I just 
finished reading that story. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My

06:02.365 --> 06:11.757
wife has every one of the English veterinarians, 
and I have a book signed by one of my clients, and

06:02.365 --> 06:11.757
I've read most of them. And I said, man, I've been 
that route. Yeah, we've all been there. We've all

06:15.234 --> 06:16.616
been there. If we've done a mixed practice or done 
any, they have experiences in small animals. Oh,

06:20.223 --> 06:20.884
yeah. But the thing about it, we're all too busy 
working to put it down. And a lot of us can't write.

06:26.675 --> 06:30.081
And writing like that is a true talent. And I can't 
lie, I'm too factual. He's done such a wonderful

06:32.325 --> 06:34.148
job of it. He really has. You know, if everybody 
said, well, you know, I bet if you'd have written

06:35.260 --> 06:40.266
down all the things that happened, you could have 
written a book like that. And I said, well, I could

06:40.286 --> 06:44.512
have written down all those things, but I probably 
could not have written a book like that. Couldn't

06:44.572 --> 06:45.633
have written a book like that. Well, I got started 
in Mexico when I was down there and had a lot of time.

06:48.076 --> 06:52.302
And I was out running around in a Jeep or an airplane 
or riding hard back in the mountains. And so I took a

06:52.963 --> 06:56.427
lot of pictures when I was on foot in the mountains. 
And that's what really got me to thinking in 1948

06:56.447 --> 07:00.673
through 51 when I was down there. And I still have 
stuff from then on. Plus, every day now, I go on a

07:03.104 --> 07:06.847
night call and it's really an experience. I said, 
you know, that'd make good article, if I could

07:07.588 --> 07:10.511
write it up for you. So that's why I have so many that 
are, you know. We sent out that little flyer in the

07:15.415 --> 07:21.261
newsletter asking people to send in this kind of 
thing. I don't know if we'll get much response. You

07:22.962 --> 07:25.805
know, speaking of that, you talk about things like 
that. One of the funniest things that ever

07:25.845 --> 07:32.571
happened to me was back when I started doing the zoo 
work and Fred Olin, I'm sorry, where I am. Fred was

07:34.195 --> 07:38.301
there, and he came down here from Illinois, and he 
went to work for me. And I was at Southwest Research

07:38.742 --> 07:47.596
and doing the zoo work, and only spent a very 
limited time in my practice and everything. And so

07:47.776 --> 07:49.358
he would cover for me. And he, Fred, subsequently 
went back to medical school, and he's an

07:49.639 --> 07:56.569
orthopedic surgeon, a human orthopedic surgeon. 
But I was at a party one night. And it was about, I

07:58.707 --> 08:03.455
think, probably 12, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the 
morning. And it was a formal party, you know, the

08:03.475 --> 08:06.380
tux and everything. And I got this call from the 
answering service. And the county answering

08:08.483 --> 08:10.927
service was laughing. And she said, well, Dr. 
Weiss, she said, I've got a call. And the guy's at a

08:14.092 --> 08:15.535
phone booth. And he says he has a constipated 
elephant. And she said, I questioned him. And he

08:21.375 --> 08:22.958
said, it's real. He wasn't pulling a joke or 
anything else. And so I said, good grief. I said,

08:29.469 --> 08:30.651
good grief. And so I took the number. And I thought, 
Jesus, I don't want to have to leave this party. And

08:34.658 --> 08:36.862
so I called Fred and woke him up. And I said, Fred, 
I've got this call. And I said, it's kind of a

08:40.507 --> 08:43.410
specialized call. And I could only think of one 
veterinarian in the whole world who's qualified

08:43.470 --> 08:47.855
to take it. And that's you. And he said, oh, come on. 
What is it? What is it? And I said, well, just call

08:53.200 --> 08:55.042
this number. I can't tell you what it's about. But 
just call this number. And I said, the guy's

08:58.226 --> 09:01.309
waiting at a phone booth and everything. And it is 
an emergency. And so the phone went on back to the

09:02.930 --> 09:06.154
party. We got home about 2 or 2.30. 4.30 in the 
morning, my phone rang. And I picked it up, and he

09:12.811 --> 09:20.145
said, biggest goddamn elephant I ever saw. And it 
was a little circus, was wintering out here in the

09:20.165 --> 09:31.607
south side of town, and it was this big, this old 
elephant, and he was down, and Fred gave him an

09:20.165 --> 09:31.607
enema with a garden hose. and gave him a great big 
shot of one of those injectable laxatives. I can't

09:35.858 --> 09:37.421
even think of the name of it. Yeah. Stiglin. That is 
a story. That was a funny one. Oh, bubba hubba. What

09:43.753 --> 09:45.436
is it, a regal? Well, I use it. I grow it down, and you 
use Stiglin. It's a little stronger. And you use

09:48.982 --> 09:51.847
Copan, which is mild. Yeah, but back then, it was 
probably... I don't even remember what it was.

09:55.685 --> 09:57.807
There haven't been many adventures with a 
constipated elephant. No, that was it. We still

09:58.969 --> 10:00.171
laugh about that. Fred probably never treated 
that one before, Eddie. Well, what do you think?

10:05.418 --> 10:05.799
Good to see you. Well, I want to get with you. Yes, 
sir. You know, when you're convenient. Because

10:11.486 --> 10:13.810
I've got, this is since 1948. And I have stuff that I 
went up to Kerrville to an ostrich farm the other

10:15.512 --> 10:19.938
day. And a lot of these things just... Like we say, 
we all have them. You get in some crazy things in

10:25.102 --> 10:26.844
exotics. One thing, at least you're saving it in 
your conscience. The main thing is, especially,

10:29.168 --> 10:37.780
you know, I think you get more out in a different 
environment at farms and ranches and dairies than

10:29.168 --> 10:37.780
you do in your clinic. Because in a clinic, you're 
in the same place. So that's why I think they're

10:39.823 --> 10:49.316
more interesting if you're in different 
environments and different farms and different,

10:39.823 --> 10:49.316
everything, environment and everything. But 
anyway, we all have them. Everybody that's in

10:50.838 --> 10:52.000
practice has them. I think so. It's just a matter of 
writing them up properly. So are the people you've

10:57.498 --> 11:00.284
ever contacted. Oh, the people. Doc Anderson. 
You've been here for Doc Anderson? Yes. I've got an

11:05.757 --> 11:07.180
article on her. I started years ago. Is she still 
alive? I don't know, she's too mean to lie. We could

11:13.961 --> 11:17.706
have let you talk a little bit. No, no, I'm not here 
to talk. Listen, absolutely. What I would like to

11:20.770 --> 11:27.519
do, but I didn't want to stop the conversation 
because that's the kind of stuff I was really after

11:20.770 --> 11:27.519
is what you were talking about. But let's, if you 
will, go back and let me ask each of you to sort of

11:28.060 --> 11:39.435
identify yourself, explain a little bit about 
your background, how you got into veterinary

11:28.060 --> 11:39.435
medicine, a little biographical sketch, if you 
will. And then I'd like to sort of focus on your area

11:39.685 --> 11:55.611
of expertise, and if you will, each of you kind of 
add to it, because this is what makes this kind of an

11:39.685 --> 11:55.611
interview work, is that people interrelate and 
ask questions of each other. So don't feel like

11:55.651 --> 11:58.936
you're just listening to me and whoever's 
talking. But Tom, you now are focusing primarily

12:05.656 --> 12:34.718
birds right here well i'll do general small animal 
work yeah and uh i want to follow that up and then uh

12:05.656 --> 12:34.718
elder or an elder an elder i'd like to talk to you 
about how you got into medical medicine and then

12:05.656 --> 12:34.718
you were one of the early women licensed 
practitioners in texas i believe i'd like to

12:05.656 --> 12:34.718
follow up on that and then all of us talk a little bit 
about women in the practice but that's clearly one

12:05.656 --> 12:34.718
of the changing profiles first one around here I 
took the State Board with her at 48. Now there's a

12:37.305 --> 12:41.993
class at A&M, I assume you know, the last two years, 
over half girls. Oh, it's been longer than that.

12:43.416 --> 12:48.885
It's been longer than that, because Archie 
Flowers, the year that Barbara Lewis was up there,

12:43.416 --> 12:48.885
was over 50. You're looking at a steep change in the 
whole profile of the profession. Yeah, the most

12:53.152 --> 12:57.600
dramatic of which I can identify with when we go to 
seminars, Because there used to not be a line at all

12:58.019 --> 13:03.667
in the ladies' room. It's the truth. But you know, 
when I first started teaching at A&M in 1969, I

13:05.169 --> 13:10.236
still remember my first class. I'd come over from 
South Louisiana. And I had 130 men in that class,

13:12.018 --> 13:17.125
one woman, And I swear I believe 30 or 40 of those men 
were asleep. They were all in uniform. It was 8

13:21.463 --> 13:22.485
o'clock class. And I'm like, gosh, what have I 
gotten into? And I didn't know what the problem

13:26.190 --> 13:27.511
was. I hadn't even started lecturing yet. So I knew 
my lecture wasn't that bad. And they were asleep.

13:31.517 --> 13:34.020
Well, they'd been out, you know, doing their 
thing. Well, now it's the Texas Hall of Fame. Yeah.

13:36.884 --> 13:37.345
That's right. They're doing that. And then, 
Mason, you're... Well, I've done strictly large

13:42.586 --> 13:46.155
animal work. That's all I ever did. Okay, let's 
talk about that. But you're doing more zoo type?

13:52.389 --> 13:56.820
That's what I really like, and that's what I'm 
doing most of the time is exotic zoo ranch type

13:52.389 --> 13:56.820
animals. So let's talk about that. So each of you 
represented in a way a special niche in the whole

14:01.503 --> 14:04.908
I'm sure we're all very opinionated. That's good, 
too. You know I am. Well, I know she is. She knows I

14:08.172 --> 14:09.013
am. Tom does. We all are. So who wants to kick off 
with a sort of a personal sketch now? Chris, I'm Dr.

14:15.602 --> 14:24.794
Tom Weiss, and I started, I graduated in 1957 from 
Michigan State University. I grew up in a small

14:27.119 --> 14:35.228
rural town in Indiana, Wabash, Indiana, and was 
interested primarily when I was in veterinary

14:27.119 --> 14:35.228
school in doing large animal or farm practice. Why 
did you get into vet practice? Well, I worked for a

14:37.571 --> 14:52.688
cousin on his farm during the summertime, and then 
a close personal friend of my parents was a

14:37.571 --> 14:52.688
veterinarian, and so I started working for him 
some part-time on weekends as a kid. and all of a

14:53.140 --> 15:05.495
sudden decided, you know, gosh, this is what I want 
to be, a veterinarian, and went on to veterinary

14:53.140 --> 15:05.495
school, and fortunately picked something that I 
was loved and was well adapted to and did well at.

15:05.736 --> 15:17.631
And so when I graduated, I practiced in a small 
animal practice in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for

15:05.736 --> 15:17.631
several months, and then went in the Air Force, 
applied for a commission in the Air Force. It was

15:17.651 --> 15:19.553
either that or get drafted back then. And so I got 
commissioned in the Air Force and was stationed

15:19.972 --> 15:27.842
here in San Antonio at Kelly Air Force Base. 
Everybody used to ask me, you know, what in the

15:27.863 --> 15:31.307
world is a veterinarian doing in the Air Force? You 
know, I said, well, he castrates jets. But I fell in

15:35.633 --> 15:45.025
love with San Antonio at that time and also with a 
Texas gal and wanted to really stay here. And when I

15:45.105 --> 15:48.510
got out of the Air Force, why? Some of the local 
veterinarians, I used to have the advantage of

15:49.182 --> 15:58.958
inspecting about 50 food establishments in San 
Antonio once a month that supplied food to the

15:49.182 --> 15:58.958
base. And so I would go out on these inspections, 
and I'd stop by veterinary hospitals and get to

15:59.779 --> 16:07.812
know veterinarians. And pretty soon, you know, 
before I got out of the Air Force, I think I knew

16:07.832 --> 16:14.903
almost all of the practitioners in San Antonio, 
you know, personally. And so I had a lot of

16:15.457 --> 16:21.264
encouragement to stay here, along with my wife, 
and wanted to. And so I took the Texas boards. And

16:23.386 --> 16:25.669
I've been here ever since. So my interest. Is there 
any difficulty in an outsider coming in and taking

16:27.211 --> 16:32.077
the Texas boards and getting your license ? It's 
tough. I was lucky. In those days, Texas and

16:34.780 --> 16:38.865
Michigan had reciprocation. And so all I had to do 
was to take the practical part of the examination.

16:43.992 --> 16:49.158
I didn't have to take the written part of the exam 
and everything. And since I had a Michigan

16:49.778 --> 16:55.224
license, it was a little easier for me at that 
point. And so I went into practice with an older

16:55.785 --> 17:02.493
veterinarian who's now dead, Dr. Walter Lawrence 
in San Antonio. And you asked me about how I got

17:03.153 --> 17:05.776
involved with birds. And of course, we were. 
talking about that I kinda felt that that was the

17:06.908 --> 17:33.540
time when veterinary medicine was really losing 
poultry practice and there was a lot of discussion

17:06.908 --> 17:33.540
in the profession editorials and how could we save 
this part of veterinary practice and it was

17:06.908 --> 17:33.540
primarily because veterinarians really weren't 
interested in poultry practice and didn't want to

17:06.908 --> 17:33.540
get involved and so I saw a couple of parakeets and 
people called me and I said well you know, they

17:34.094 --> 17:46.209
brought them in, and they'd been to the pet shop, 
and the pet shop had given them medicine and told

17:34.094 --> 17:46.209
them all this stuff about how to treat them, and I 
thought to myself, you know, the same thing's

17:34.094 --> 17:46.209
going to happen with this. Pets that people buy at 
pet shops, monkeys and birds and all these little

17:46.489 --> 18:00.827
animals, guinea pigs and hamsters and things like 
that, if veterinarians don't treat them, why,

17:46.489 --> 18:00.827
pretty soon, they're going to, you know, that part 
of practice, whatever it might be, they're going

18:01.162 --> 18:09.495
to lose because we're certainly more qualified to 
do that than some yo-yo in a pet shop. And even

18:10.477 --> 18:23.998
though I didn't know anything about these 
animals, we didn't get anything in veterinary

18:10.477 --> 18:23.998
school about them, I just tried to apply my 
knowledge of medicine to a species that I really

18:10.477 --> 18:23.998
didn't know a whole lot about. And so I started 
doing it and pretty soon the reputation spread

18:24.018 --> 18:29.346
around and veterinarians would get one of their 
clients a call and they had a sick parakeet or a sick

18:29.663 --> 18:37.514
parrot or a sick hamster or guinea pig or whatever 
it might be. Well, they'd say, well, we don't treat

18:37.574 --> 18:40.679
those, but call Tom Weiss. He treats them. So 
pretty soon it began to become a part of my

18:41.680 --> 18:47.068
practice. And, of course, in caged birds 
particularly, I was just down here just stumbling

18:47.088 --> 18:55.941
along trying to do the best I could. That whole part 
of veterinary practice has gone through a

18:56.579 --> 19:04.669
tremendous evolution in about the last eight or 
nine years. And I think it was about eight years

19:05.189 --> 19:16.503
ago, there were 40 veterinarians, myself 
included, that met for the first time in

19:05.189 --> 19:16.503
Kalamazoo, Michigan. And these were guys who were 
interested in cage birds, treating cage birds.

19:22.209 --> 19:25.253
And a classmate of mine in Michigan, Ron Spink, 
knew that I did this, and so he contacted me, and Ron

19:25.925 --> 19:32.415
was the one who contacted veterinarians 
throughout the country. And we formed an

19:33.256 --> 19:38.283
organization called the American Association of 
Avian Veterinarians. And now it has over, I think,

19:39.225 --> 19:45.374
1,200 or 1,300 members worldwide. It's the 
fastest-growing specialty association in

19:46.656 --> 19:51.443
veterinary medicine. And it has piqued a 
tremendous amount of interest in cave bird

19:52.148 --> 19:56.714
medicine. It's stimulated research and sharing 
of information. It was a wonderful experience for

20:01.680 --> 20:10.230
me just to get together with other veterinarians 
who treated these birds and share our own clinical

20:01.680 --> 20:10.230
experiences and everything. And they now have a 
journal. And we just had a meeting, the

20:11.592 --> 20:16.658
international meeting, in Houston last 
September. And there were probably 500 to 600

20:16.678 --> 20:20.383
veterinarians there from all over the world. and 
papers being presented. And of course, caged

20:22.190 --> 20:27.315
birds have become tremendously popular now as 
pets. Back when I was the only one in this whole area

20:27.335 --> 20:35.805
of Texas that would even look at one and treat it, I 
didn't see nearly as many as I see today. And back

20:35.865 --> 20:39.128
then, you could buy a parrot for $100 or $150. Now 
they run from $300 to $8,000 for a hyacinth macaw. I

20:47.017 --> 20:50.100
didn't see nearly as many of them as I do today. And 
today I have competition. There are many other

20:52.075 --> 20:55.559
veterinarians now who are treating birds. Are 
they getting training now? They're getting, yes.

20:58.402 --> 21:00.123
In fact, yes. I was about, I think, six or seven 
years ago, got an appointment to the faculty at A&M

21:00.364 --> 21:15.700
as an adjunct professor and went up and lectured 
three or four times a year on caged bird medicine to

21:00.364 --> 21:15.700
the third year class. And now A&M is really in the 
forefront of this whole thing. Mr. Richard

21:21.507 --> 21:41.232
Schubot from Florida, a very wealthy man who's 
really interested in these birds, and their

21:21.507 --> 21:41.232
future donated a million dollars to the 
veterinary school at A&M to establish a chair in

21:21.507 --> 21:41.232
caged bird medicine in the Department of 
Microbiology. the school, I think, matched that.

21:44.815 --> 21:50.920
So it's a $2 million chair, which is one of the more 
endowed chairs or maybe the most endowed chair in

21:44.815 --> 21:50.920
the university. And they established the Shoebot 
Avian Disease Center. And Dr. David Graham, who's

21:55.724 --> 22:03.691
an internationally recognized avian or caged 
bird pathologist, is now there and heading up

21:55.724 --> 22:03.691
that. And the emphasis in teaching now is shifted 
away from poultry medicine to caged bird

22:04.251 --> 22:10.797
medicine. Dr. Tizard, who's the head of the 
Department of Microbiology, and I had a long

22:11.317 --> 22:26.725
discussion about it, and he said, well, you know, 
he said there are probably eight veterinarians in

22:11.317 --> 22:26.725
the state of Texas involved in poultry medicine, 
and six of those eight are on the staff of the

22:11.317 --> 22:26.725
university. And we have an obligation to support 
the poultry industry of the state, but we do that

22:27.146 --> 22:35.080
with diagnostic medicine and those kinds of 
things. He said, we feel that our teaching

22:35.296 --> 22:42.907
emphasis should be on what the students are going 
to see when they get out there and practice, and

22:35.296 --> 22:42.907
that's Kate's word. And they're in another 
university in the country, or veterinary school

22:43.548 --> 22:54.925
in the country, that has gone to that extent to 
dedicate their teaching programs to Kate's word

22:43.548 --> 22:54.925
medicine. But to get back to my background, then I 
took a job. I left and started my own practice on

23:01.081 --> 23:04.424
Broadway. In fact, Dr. Tremere, as we talked 
about, and Saunders and Larson really helped me

23:04.484 --> 23:10.370
get started. I really couldn't have done it 
without them. And right around the corner from

23:13.493 --> 23:22.082
them, they leased the old Broadway Animal 
Hospital to me and had equipment in it and cages and

23:13.493 --> 23:22.082
everything. In fact, Wallace moved over and 
started running this large animal practice out of

23:22.142 --> 23:26.606
there, too. And we shared the old Broadway Animal 
Hospital. And then I took a job. Again, I didn't

23:33.248 --> 23:37.714
literally have a pot to pee in or a window to throw it 
out. And so I took a job part time as a veterinarian,

23:38.375 --> 23:49.911
first veterinarian on the staff at Southwest 
Foundation for research and education for the big

23:38.375 --> 23:49.911
primate colonies. Yeah, I think you have a friend 
who worked out there. Yeah. I was the first

23:52.375 --> 23:55.179
veterinarian that they'd ever had on their staff. 
They'd just established their big baboon colony.

23:57.843 --> 24:01.007
And I took a job there part time. Well, it started 
two hours a day, gradually grew to four hours a day,

24:01.358 --> 24:12.978
and then to a full-time staff position, I kept my 
veterinary practice. And at that time, that's

24:12.998 --> 24:20.150
when I hired Dr. Olin, who is now the orthopedic 
surgeon that had the elephant episode. And about

24:20.170 --> 24:25.138
that time, Fred Stark, who was the director of the 
zoo, came to me. and asked me if I would do the zoo

24:25.642 --> 24:28.667
work, too. And that was a part-time position. So 
that was another chance to pick up another $300,

24:30.631 --> 24:35.559
$400 a month. And so I took that job, too. I used to 
drive 150 miles a day and never got out of the city. I

24:41.449 --> 24:43.853
would go to my office at 7 o'clock in the morning I'd 
leave there at about 8 and go to Southwest

24:44.137 --> 24:47.841
Research. I'd leave there at 11 and go to the zoo. 
I'd leave the zoo at 1, go back to Southwest

24:50.685 --> 24:56.572
Research, leave there at 4.30 and go back to my 
practice. So you started all this very early on in

24:56.952 --> 24:59.475
your practice. Yes, that's right. And so I was the 
zoo veterinarian for about four and a half years,

25:00.356 --> 25:08.085
and then Stubby came on and took over the zoo work at 
that time. And shortly after that, then I left

25:08.538 --> 25:14.064
Southwest Research and went back to my practice 
full time. So from that very beginning, I've

25:14.585 --> 25:20.912
always treated what we call exotic pets. Those are 
pets other than dogs and cats. And exotic practice

25:23.956 --> 25:26.339
was a lot different in those days. In fact, a small 
percentage of it was caged birds, quite frankly.

25:31.885 --> 25:34.208
We saw a lot of ocelots. and surveil cats and jungle 
cats, margay cats, all these exotic cats that were

25:34.525 --> 25:41.052
being imported. We saw monkeys, lots of pet 
monkeys. And a lot of other indigenous wild

25:44.596 --> 25:48.981
animals. It wasn't unusual then for people to keep 
raccoons and skunks as pets and everything. So we

25:54.707 --> 25:57.430
saw a lot of wild animals as pets. And then I used to 
almost hate to see the spring come because when all

26:02.875 --> 26:10.905
the baby birds started coming out of the nests and 
stuff, and people would find this little bird in

26:02.875 --> 26:10.905
their yard, and they'd call their veterinarian 
and say, oh, we don't treat birds. Call Tom Weiss.

26:12.166 --> 26:15.190
And boy, my phone would just ring off the wall. I 
mean, they would just get deluged with it. Now,

26:18.794 --> 26:26.824
most of those imported wild animals that people 
would try to keep as pets are now on an endangered

26:18.794 --> 26:26.824
species list. And so we seldom see pet monkeys 
anymore. We don't see any of the exotic cats except

26:29.973 --> 26:38.846
the big cats that breed well in captivity, cougars 
and jaguars and lions and tigers. And there are

26:38.886 --> 26:44.014
guys breeding those and selling them to people as 
pets and that type of thing. So now almost I would

26:44.955 --> 26:52.947
say that 80% to 85% of my exotic pet practice are 
caged birds. And we see, and I see in my practice, 20

26:53.872 --> 26:58.097
to 30 birds a day. Is that right? We do, in fact, we 
have a bacteriology set up in the hospital, and we

27:02.182 --> 27:11.693
average about 80 to 100 cultures a month. And 
virtually all those, or 90% of those, are in birds.

27:17.179 --> 27:21.364
Are there some recent really strong importation 
restraints? Yes, and that's happening now in

27:21.800 --> 27:23.842
birds. Many, in fact, almost all the macaws except 
the blue and gold now are on threatened or

27:25.104 --> 27:32.453
endangered species lists. And many of the other 
species, and we're going to see the very same thing

27:33.133 --> 27:43.245
happen, that the importation of these larger 
cytosine birds is just going to dry up. And so we're

27:43.325 --> 27:47.250
going to have to depend on domestic production. 
With the advent of surgical sexing, you know, most

27:47.770 --> 27:53.097
of these birds are not sexually dimorphic. You 
can't tell the male from the female. And with the

27:55.540 --> 28:04.070
advent of a laparoscope about eight or nine years 
ago, why, veterinarians went in and started

27:55.540 --> 28:04.070
surgically sexing these birds. And up until that 
time, the success of domestic breeding was just

28:04.651 --> 28:12.340
very, very poor, scanty at best. Aviculturists 
were lucky when they happened to get a pair that

28:15.091 --> 28:18.717
would breed in captivity or get them paired up 
right. Now, why the success is tremendous. We're

28:21.861 --> 28:23.925
seeing more and more domestic... Yes, yes. More 
and more... I have one client who probably raises

28:25.828 --> 28:33.960
200 domestically born larger citizen birds a 
year. And so hopefully there are enough of these

28:34.882 --> 28:42.313
birds breeding in captivity that we're going to be 
able to maybe meet the demand with domestic

28:42.665 --> 28:44.047
production. So far, we can't. And we're a ways away 
from doing that. Do you have any ostrich on here?

28:49.315 --> 28:49.555
No. In fact, I get ostrich calls just like Stubby 
was talking about, why I refer them to him. Mainly

28:56.967 --> 29:00.632
because I can't really be out of my office. I'm just 
too busy to go out. That's a large animal practice,

29:01.754 --> 29:03.216
isn't it? It really is. And I can't go out on a call to 
do these. I've had numbers of young ones brought

29:06.541 --> 29:09.846
into the hospital. And we've done some orthopedic 
procedures. some other things from time to time.

29:14.259 --> 29:17.362
But, of course, they've become very popular now. 
They're in vogue. And so Stubby's going to make his

29:19.084 --> 29:23.709
fame and fortune on his ostrich practice. Okay, 
nobody knows anything about it. How about the

29:24.890 --> 29:26.652
llamas? Well, they're in the same boat right now. 
That's right. Well, you know, there's very

29:31.137 --> 29:32.338
little. The problem you get into, the challenges 
you get into in exotic pet practice are relative to

29:32.399 --> 29:42.169
the fact that there's very little basic research 
done on these animals. There's just not any money

29:44.221 --> 29:48.907
out there to fund research. And so you really have 
to apply your knowledge and a little bit of your

29:49.027 --> 30:00.622
knowledge in maybe anatomy and physiology of a 
life-type species. And then a little bit of, for

30:01.503 --> 30:08.612
instance, right now in birds, almost all of our 
antibiotic dosages are extrapolated from dogs,

30:08.980 --> 30:11.642
cats, and people. No, we're using antibiotics. 
They don't use the chickens. And in fact, the

30:15.446 --> 30:22.993
birds' predominant bacterial problems in birds 
are gram-negative infections. And they're, I

30:23.013 --> 30:33.402
think, basically a product of these birds being in 
captivity and being exposed to human and

30:23.013 --> 30:33.402
carnivore type of environments. These are 
coliform organisms that are normal in our

30:33.703 --> 30:37.406
gastrointestinal tract. They've sampled wild 
populations of birds and they seldom ever find a

30:38.731 --> 30:45.340
gram-negative bug in their gastrointestinal 
tract. And yet we deal with the predominant

30:45.360 --> 30:51.168
problem with this in these birds in captivity. And 
so we're using antibiotics like amikacin and

30:51.188 --> 31:03.726
gentamicin and piperacillin and tricarcillin 
and the third generation cephalosporins because

30:51.188 --> 31:03.726
these are bacteria that are very antibiotic 
resistant. And so all of our dosages have been

31:04.010 --> 31:09.720
extrapolated down from human dosages on a weight 
basis. And there's a lot of controversy now

31:10.140 --> 31:20.237
because of the rapid metabolism of the bird, how 
frequently they should be given to maintain

31:10.140 --> 31:20.237
adequate blood levels. And we hope there's a guy in 
North Carolina, Dr. Kevin Flammer, now that has

31:24.698 --> 31:37.970
some funding, and he's doing some blood level 
studies in different antibiotics in these birds,

31:24.698 --> 31:37.970
in different species, and hopefully we're going 
to have some very meaningful information on what

31:24.698 --> 31:37.970
we should be giving them. Most of it is trial and 
error and experience, and we seem to get results at

31:40.032 --> 31:46.118
certain levels and things. So this is the kind of 
thing that we face. And the same thing with Stubby,

31:50.282 --> 31:54.486
when he goes out here to treat an ostrich or a llama 
or or a nigyle antelope or whatever. He has to rely

31:58.919 --> 32:11.777
on knowledge, on clinical knowledge that has been 
shared among zoo veterinarians and everything

31:58.919 --> 32:11.777
and is gleaned out of maybe worldwide literature. 
But there's so many big gaps in this that a lot of

32:11.857 --> 32:16.604
stuff is empirical. It's been based upon clinical 
trials. Some guy treated a case and wrote it up and

32:19.468 --> 32:24.355
published it in a zoo journal or something of that 
nature. It's not been controlled, definitive

32:24.757 --> 32:29.364
experiments. Same way in nutrition. And a lot of 
our problems in exotic species, birds included,

32:30.505 --> 32:52.857
but all these others, are nutritional problems 
and management problems because we really lack

32:30.505 --> 32:52.857
the knowledge to know, again, and the big 
four-stomach puss talk, why we're basically

32:30.505 --> 32:52.857
extrapolating our knowledge of cattle and sheep 
and domestics to these species and And we may be

32:53.157 --> 32:59.027
way, way off base in a lot of areas. Are there many 
people now going into a defined exotic bird or

32:59.047 --> 33:06.439
animal practice? Well, birds there are. There's a 
tremendous interest in that. There always is. The

33:10.727 --> 33:17.578
student chapters at A&M, for instance, they have a 
student chapter of the American Association of

33:10.727 --> 33:17.578
Zoo Veterinarians. And they always have a big 
membership. Kids are interested. They all dream

33:22.193 --> 33:24.697
about getting a job in a zoo. The problem is there 
are not many jobs out there in zoos. And so I have,

33:28.241 --> 33:34.149
you know, we do preceptorships in my practice and 
have for quite some time. And so I get students from

33:34.750 --> 33:37.293
all over the country. I've got a boy from now doing a 
preceptorship with us from the University of

33:37.353 --> 33:41.058
Missouri. Is that one year or two years or one year? 
Well, they come and spend six to eight weeks with

33:42.760 --> 33:44.803
us. Six to eight weeks. Yes, and either in their 
third or fourth year. Yeah. I've got already for

33:48.136 --> 33:55.787
next year, I've got four scheduled for A&M that 
have contacted me and want to come and spend it.

33:56.068 --> 34:02.096
Because we do, in my practice, we do see these 
exotics and they're interested in learning about

33:56.068 --> 34:02.096
them. There's a lot more than you've ever had. 
Yeah, oh yeah. I've had preceptors from Michigan

34:05.201 --> 34:15.696
State, from Auburn University, University of 
Florida, Oklahoma, Louisiana State, including

34:05.201 --> 34:15.696
A&M too. And we enjoy having them. It's fun, and 
it's challenging for us. And they get to see an

34:20.568 --> 34:28.076
aspect of their practice that they don't in an 
average small animal practice. I would think that

34:28.096 --> 34:30.258
whole field is going to explode. Oh, it is. It is. 
And the future of it is in-cage birds, because

34:31.720 --> 34:37.967
basically those are the first two reasons. Number 
one, birds adapt well. They're a social creature,

34:40.429 --> 34:43.593
and they make good pets. Most other wild animals do 
not. Their wild carnivores are not social animals

34:46.270 --> 34:54.362
by nature, and when we put them in a human social 
environment, they literally can't cope with it.

34:54.682 --> 35:04.816
And that's the reason they're cute, cuddly, 
friendly little animals until they become

34:54.682 --> 35:04.816
sexually mature, and then all of a sudden, they 
become a wild animal again, or become

34:54.682 --> 35:04.816
unpredictable and attack. The most dangerous 
wild animal is one that's been domestically

35:04.836 --> 35:11.586
raised, because he has no fear of man. The ones that 
have a fear, man, as Dubby can tell you, when you're

35:12.038 --> 35:24.170
dealing with one of these animals that's not been 
raised around people, it's much easier to deal

35:12.038 --> 35:24.170
with them. In fact, when I was at Southwest 
Research, we had a colony of baboons we called

35:24.571 --> 35:31.838
domestic baboons that were purchased from the San 
Antonio Zoo. And they had been a closed colony of

35:32.459 --> 35:37.624
baboons for 35 years. And those were the toughest 
animals in the world to deal with. They had no fear

35:41.383 --> 35:42.644
of us. The ones we trapped in Africa and brought in 
were easy. They just wanted to get away from you.

35:49.090 --> 35:50.531
They wanted to get away from you. They didn't want 
to attack you at all. And that's true. That's what

35:55.055 --> 35:58.819
makes difficult in some of these big cats that are 
being sold. You know, these things have no fear of

35:59.980 --> 36:02.262
man. And so they're really dangerous when you have 
to deal with them on a medical level. That's

36:07.777 --> 36:12.464
very true. I've got a couple of articles I've 
written on the declawing. Tom quoted some things

36:17.351 --> 36:20.335
that he and I have both been saying. They're cute 
little cuddly things. I have clients that have

36:23.139 --> 36:24.662
lions. He has too. They buy a little cub. They're 
cute just like a little kitten. Then they meet

36:28.327 --> 36:30.750
maturity, reach puberty. They change. And then 
the people eat too much. They tear up furniture.

36:34.736 --> 36:35.978
They're too aggressive. People don't want them. I 
found one. I gave to a circus. You can't tell if

36:41.088 --> 36:42.570
anybody wants them now. They want them naturally. 
Well, they always have them declawed, defanged,

36:43.451 --> 36:47.157
neutered. And that doesn't, you know, you can take 
an aggressive dog and you can neuter him, and it

36:47.297 --> 36:56.690
generally is a sexual aggression, and 90% of the 
time it'll pretty well settle him down. But these

36:57.611 --> 36:59.714
wild animals, it doesn't. Their aggression is not 
related to that type of sexual territorial

36:59.734 --> 37:03.860
aggression. It's strictly to their wild 
instincts. I've had a lot of people call and want me

37:05.723 --> 37:08.146
to declaw, defange. I said, I will not do it. I don't 
believe in it, and I won't do it. I don't care how

37:10.209 --> 37:11.010
much you do it. But somebody's going to do it. Yeah. 
But then you can't get rid of them. The people don't

37:16.545 --> 37:18.047
want them. They usually end up having to be put 
down. I always say it's another example of man

37:21.811 --> 37:25.335
sitting humanity down. Man controls it all, 
unfortunately. Tell me how you got into that

37:28.979 --> 37:32.663
practice. Okay, well, I've always been an 
outdoors person. I was very athletic and this and

37:36.347 --> 37:39.891
that and liked outdoors. When I got into it, 
school. I got out in 1948 and I knew I didn't want to

37:43.902 --> 37:51.453
go into a ranch practice. It was pretty difficult 
to get into a ranch practice the type you wanted. So

37:55.919 --> 37:56.961
I went down. This is A&M, right? Yes, sir. She and I 
took state board together in 1948. Second, third,

38:02.388 --> 38:03.390
February. This is a total aside, but my cousin's 
over here, Ray Hargis from Louisiana. Did you

38:08.557 --> 38:09.398
happen to know him? that's great i knew no i knew uh 
johnny broussard who was johnny was class ahead of

38:10.087 --> 38:39.385
me yeah he went he transferred to auburn alabama 
well he graduated from auburn anyway i haven't

38:10.087 --> 38:39.385
found him i haven't found anything i didn't meet 
you you know i sound familiar but you're a good

38:10.087 --> 38:39.385
fortune well anyway uh so anyway i went down to my 
folks had a little ranch down here south near

38:10.087 --> 38:39.385
charlotte and ascos county i went down there my and 
i got a job with a veterans ag school And I was

38:39.652 --> 38:40.814
practicing. It was teaching. It was a program they 
had for veterans, like the college program for

38:42.055 --> 38:46.362
boys that are eligible. It was a veterans training 
program because you had Harold Shearhart. Yeah.

38:50.167 --> 38:52.571
Her present husband was teaching in it. And I 
didn't know what I wanted to do. So I went out and

38:53.852 --> 38:55.314
lived at the ranch. How many of you have? I taught 
this veteran school and was piddling around,

38:57.498 --> 39:03.907
running around, and then started trying to 
practice. Well, I was just kind of running around.

39:06.711 --> 39:07.532
So let me ask you. When you got out of school, you 
were not really sure at all what you were going to

39:07.833 --> 39:10.797
do. I really didn't know what I wanted to do. I knew 
what I wanted to do, but I hadn't found my little

39:12.138 --> 39:15.222
niche yet. So a friend was in Mexico on a foot and 
mouth disease program. They had a big foot and

39:19.067 --> 39:21.049
mouth disease program in Mexico. And my friend 
said, you ought to come down here. You can save

39:22.711 --> 39:27.297
money, make money, have adventures, see Mexico, 
and get paid for it. It's a civil service job. So I

39:29.379 --> 39:31.101
got to thinking about it. So I applied and went down 
here. It was USDA, Bureau of Animal Industry,

39:35.828 --> 39:44.159
Bureau of Animal Industry, Civil Service job. And 
they gave all the veterinarians interpreters,

39:44.179 --> 39:47.423
naturally. We worked, we hopped in horseback, 
foot, airplane, muleback, jeep, to go look at

39:48.184 --> 39:59.239
animals that were suspicious of foot and mouth. We 
had, the foot and mouth was, Mexico was divided

39:59.259 --> 40:05.667
into districts and sub-districts and areas where 
You had inspectors looking at them. So I really got

40:07.809 --> 40:09.711
this. Are you working with Mexican authorities 
also? Yeah, the American government naturally

40:11.974 --> 40:15.078
footed the bill on everything, like we always do. 
And everybody had a Mexican counterpart. And of

40:19.203 --> 40:20.825
course, the Americans paid for it. And if you name 
it, we had it happen. It was quite an experience,

40:23.408 --> 40:26.913
quite an adventure. I've had machetes pulled on 
me, guns pulled on me. I've flown in airplanes and

40:29.997 --> 40:32.700
dropped the vaccine on the beach. That's why I say I 
have a lot of experience in that. But it was very

40:35.526 --> 40:39.552
interesting and challenging.

40:40.293 --> 40:41.314
Then I... So how long were you down? I was there 
three years. Where did you domicile most of the

40:43.598 --> 40:48.505
time? Everybody goes to Mexico City for 
indoctrination. You spend a week or so. Then I went

40:52.571 --> 40:56.537
down to Jalisco, Guadalajara, and that area. I 
worked out of there in little towns, villages, and

40:56.657 --> 40:59.101
ranches. Then I came back up. worked at Mexico City 
in the milk shed, the dairies, the zoo, doing the

41:03.292 --> 41:13.404
vaccinating and inspection around for 
suspicious animals. And then I moved around and

41:13.424 --> 41:18.369
they wanted to make an office man out of me in Mexico 
City and it would have been an upgrade. I didn't

41:18.429 --> 41:19.130
want it. I said, I want to go back out in the fields. 
So I went down, after that, back down between

41:20.732 --> 41:29.762
Mexico City and Chilpancingos, back down to the 
real rough country. And I just kind of got really,

41:33.650 --> 41:38.317
Just when you and I kind of got fed up with the 
American government running off of good

41:33.650 --> 41:38.317
inspectors. You know, civil service, you had men 
that would make good reports, but they really

41:38.337 --> 41:44.967
maybe weren't doing their work out here, but 
they'd make good reports. So I just got kind of

41:45.728 --> 41:49.934
tired of it and came on back. Do you want other 
veterans, their veterinarian's name around

41:52.337 --> 41:55.362
here, what they were doing? Well, Dr. Hauser, who 
is dead now, is a fine gentleman. And Dr. Reese and

42:01.257 --> 42:03.840
them ran the police and veterinary hospital. And I 
used to. And Charlie Neal. And Charlie Neal. And I

42:06.663 --> 42:08.345
worked for the city health department. Hauser 
said, they have a job. Why don't you take it? You've

42:11.188 --> 42:12.269
got gross pathology. You can tell them maybe. So 
when you came back, you got a job with the sanitary

42:13.510 --> 42:16.033
department? Yes. Because I did media inspection, 
sanitation work. I didn't really want that. But he

42:22.160 --> 42:23.381
said, do you want to take it? It'll give you a little 
gross pathology. And you can tell them it may be

42:24.883 --> 42:29.728
temporary.

42:30.130 --> 42:31.972
So then I got interested. I didn't really like the 
environment too much, so I finally got into

42:32.413 --> 42:42.967
practice at the Old Gleason Veterinary Hospital 
with Dr. Botar, Dick Botar, who was also deceased.

42:44.469 --> 42:47.733
We had strictly large animal practice. Beef 
cattle, dairy cattle, sheep and goat, pigs. There

42:50.517 --> 42:52.079
weren't any exotics at that time. And then...

42:59.830 --> 43:11.121
Boatard wanted to go to Kingsville, so Bernie 
James, who was an equine practitioner, and I, but

42:59.830 --> 43:11.121
he bought Boatard's half out. Bernie and I worked 
there for a while, and then we built Northwest

43:12.102 --> 43:16.066
Veterinary Hospital on IH-10. We had that for 22 
years, strictly large animals.

43:22.172 --> 43:25.635
Mostly, we had a lot of dairies, horses, so forth, 
large animals on there. Is Bernie still here? He's

43:29.250 --> 43:30.571
in the Ritama pool. He's still running out of 
there? Well, I hadn't seen him for so long. I didn't

43:33.454 --> 43:37.698
know whether when Ritama kind of went under, I 
didn't know. So you're still with large animals

43:38.459 --> 43:43.924
all the way through, but the large animal practice 
is changing? Oh, it's changing. It's become more

43:44.965 --> 43:46.487
specialized. But also, there's less of it, isn't 
there? Well, there's about five or six. Let's see,

43:52.593 --> 43:54.795
Bernie, Richard, Jerry, There's about four or 
five veterinarians in this area doing strictly

43:55.923 --> 43:59.187
equine work. Strictly equine. Jake does a lot of 
equine. Jake does a lot of equine, but he does make

44:02.291 --> 44:05.434
some dog's head. Yeah. Like most small animals. 
The reason why most veterinarians, in my image of

44:07.217 --> 44:12.563
it, is start out, I guess, with mixed practices. 
Small animals. Mixed practices. And then it

44:13.684 --> 44:16.187
becomes heavily small animals. Well, it depends 
on what they like. It ends up predominantly small

44:17.289 --> 44:20.392
animals. Depends on what they like. That's what 
I'm trying to say. It doesn't have anything to do

44:22.355 --> 44:24.377
with the market in particular, but more what the 
vet wants. Well, I think most people kind of end up

44:24.560 --> 44:31.028
doing, after you get a little older, I think they 
kind of get off and kind of what they enjoy. Well,

44:31.048 --> 44:34.352
Jimmy Rothen now is doing most of the dairy work. 
And he's not even here, Tom. He stays up in North

44:35.513 --> 44:36.534
Texas. He's looking for a helper. Yeah, I knew he 
was. As far as dairy cattle work, I refer to Erland,

44:38.437 --> 44:50.912
and I refer to another veterinary in the east of 
town for most of my cattle work because it's too

44:38.437 --> 44:50.912
hard on my bursitis to do calf delivery stuff 
anymore. So it's becoming more specialized, and

44:50.932 --> 44:54.516
it's going to become more specialized. But it's 
not because there's less emphasis on large

44:55.778 --> 45:03.289
animals or anything, but it's just that there's 
more opportunity in small animals. There's

45:03.309 --> 45:05.091
definitely more opportunity in small animals. 
You utilize your time more efficiently.

45:07.174 --> 45:08.216
Everything comes right to you. Large animal work, 
you go out, you have a lot more wasted time. And you

45:12.442 --> 45:18.090
have to really like it and really sacrifice some 
time to do it. Because there's a lot of wasted time

45:18.627 --> 45:22.792
and waiting and can't catch a cow. Well, you know, 
in fact, I always say that I think that at least 50%

45:22.812 --> 45:36.790
of the small animal practitioners

45:22.812 --> 45:36.790
that I know are probably frustrated ranchers and 
large animal practitioners. Sure, right.

45:37.130 --> 45:39.994
Because almost about half the guys in town own a 
little piece of land somewhere they're running

45:40.261 --> 45:42.303
cattle on. Bubba included, and Dan Hill, and 
rather Ted Harwood, Jimmy McMullen, Robbins. But

45:49.952 --> 45:51.574
that's right, exactly what he says. We all, most 
people like to get out and like some cattle. But the

45:55.378 --> 46:00.905
nature, the efficiency of the business, the small 
animal, you hear everything comes to you. And the

46:01.566 --> 46:07.012
other is inefficient and poor efficiency 
actually utilizing your time. But so then while we

46:08.033 --> 46:09.795
were over there, Well, like Tom said, he was going 
to the zoo at noon. And Joe Straus called up Bernie

46:13.706 --> 46:16.170
and I. We had done a lot of horse work. And he said, 
would you all want to zoo work? We said, we don't

46:20.355 --> 46:22.458
know anybody exotic animals. He said, well, you 
can learn like everybody else. So we had a young

46:24.701 --> 46:26.944
veterinarian working for us, Richard Mayes. So we 
took it over for practically nothing. We had no

46:31.009 --> 46:32.631
facilities whatsoever. No. Terrible. Nothing. 
And then I became interested, because I was an

46:34.153 --> 46:40.221
older one, more interested in wildlife, and 
Richard was really not interested. He was

46:41.960 --> 46:43.041
interested in equine only. So then I started going 
to the zoo. So I had the zoo for, we had it for nine

46:44.303 --> 46:46.686
years. I did it for eight years. Did send on the zoo. 
And while I was there, we built, they built a health

46:49.930 --> 46:52.253
center. We made some progress in veterinary 
medicine. Yeah, we, old Fred Stark that used to be

46:54.876 --> 47:08.314
the zoo director, he's, for many, he's dead now, 
but he, for many years, he was revered in the

46:54.876 --> 47:08.314
community because he'd been at the zoo since a high 
school, high school kid, you know. But he was the

47:08.334 --> 47:09.415
most unscientific he was a good smart old animal 
man but he had a lot of experience but he
