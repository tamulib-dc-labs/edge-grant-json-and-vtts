00:02.073 --> 00:11.606
This is an interview with Mr. Billy Pete 
Huddleston by Dwayne Purvis on May the 6th at the

00:02.073 --> 00:11.606
Petroleum Engineering Building at Texas A&M. In 
the interest of accumulating knowledge, I am

00:12.367 --> 00:20.377
asking you to donate this tape to me or to the Texas 
A&M Oral History Collection in the University

00:12.367 --> 00:20.377
Archives. Is that all right with you? That will be 
fine. All right. Let's talk a little bit about your

00:24.082 --> 00:26.525
background. Were you born and raised? I was born in 
a small West Texas town of Ira Ann, I-R-A-A-N. It

00:36.462 --> 00:40.508
was named after Ira and Ann Yates. Ira Ann also 
happens to be about the center of the Yates oil

00:40.528 --> 00:59.637
field, which is one of the largest oil fields in the 
North American continent, and still has the well

00:40.528 --> 00:59.637
that tested at the highest flow rate that's ever 
been tested in the North American continent, over

00:40.528 --> 00:59.637
250,000 barrels per day. That's incredible. So 
you grew up around there a little? I grew up in the

01:03.014 --> 01:04.936
field itself. I was actually born in an oil field 
camp in what they call their nurse's quarters,

01:04.996 --> 01:18.653
delivered by an oil field lady that was called a 
midwife that delivered all the children in the

01:04.996 --> 01:18.653
camp. In fact, I've got a photograph of the 82 
children that she delivered in that one oil field

01:18.673 --> 01:25.101
camp. busy camp. Yeah, right. Then you went to A&M 
for your undergraduate? I graduated from RN High

01:30.876 --> 01:34.321
School in 1952. I came to A&M on a football 
scholarship and studied petroleum engineering.

01:41.070 --> 01:45.477
I took some additional courses and graduated in 
five years. I ended up with 180 hours, but it was all

01:45.537 --> 01:49.082
in undergraduate work. I was not doing any 
graduate work at all. I'd worked in the summers

01:52.346 --> 01:55.611
beginning when I was 12 years old and pulling 
units, which is oil field equipment. By the time I

01:59.924 --> 02:06.874
was 15, I'd graduated to working on rotary rigs, 
and so I worked as a roughneck until I graduated

01:59.924 --> 02:06.874
from A&M. And I worked myself up as a relief 
driller, which is the highest position that you

02:08.256 --> 02:17.409
could get on the last summer that I worked prior to 
graduation. What year did you graduate? I

02:20.453 --> 02:23.337
graduated from A&M in 1957. I was employed by 
Marathon Oil Company. I started in East Texas,

02:27.118 --> 02:32.504
went to Mississippi, North Louisiana, Arkansas. 
Someplace in there, I had a two-year leave of

02:34.086 --> 02:38.311
absence. I served in a fighter interceptor 
squadron with the Air Defense Command in the

02:38.332 --> 02:44.319
United States. I was stationed in Massachusetts 
on Cape Cod, later at an Air Force base in Roswell,

02:44.439 --> 02:53.290
New Mexico. I went back to Marathon. I worked for 
them at South Louisiana, Texas Gulf Coast, and

02:56.369 --> 03:04.106
South Texas. I resigned from Marathon in 1965. I 
was 30 years old and formed my own business. Farmed

03:11.883 --> 03:13.845
Huddleston Company. It's consulting petroleum 
engineers.

03:18.670 --> 03:21.552
Had a lot of work almost immediately. Farm grew 
somewhat slowly. 1971, I formed Peter Paul

03:25.897 --> 03:32.683
Petroleum Company that still exists today. 
Principal partner in Peter Paul Petroleum

03:34.305 --> 03:40.130
Company is Princeton University Endowment Fund. 
We manage for our joint accounts, about $100

03:41.178 --> 03:45.802
million worth of oil and gas properties. So we're 
very active. Good. You're very active in small

03:48.645 --> 03:50.207
fields? Mostly small fields. We do not 
participate in offshore. We don't do deep

03:54.311 --> 03:55.812
drilling. But we do drill a good many wells. But 
rarely do we drill below 12,000 feet. And we do not

04:02.058 --> 04:04.080
drill anything offshore. OK. Looking back to 
1965, what was the condition of the industry

04:10.793 --> 04:16.942
Condition in the industry was quite depressed. 
The reason that I left Marathon, it was strange, I

04:16.963 --> 04:20.147
actually was promoted. I was a district reservoir 
engineer at Bay City, Texas, and I had been

04:20.228 --> 04:31.285
promoted to the international reservoir 
engineer, which was a giant promotion for me.

04:32.246 --> 04:35.451
Unfortunately, that job was located in New York 
City. and so i resigned in those days if you did not

04:35.971 --> 05:01.759
accept a promotion with the company then you were 
essentially going to be stagnant so i resigned

04:35.971 --> 05:01.759
moved to houston i had three small children uh 
industry was quite depressed oil was selling for

04:35.971 --> 05:01.759
two dollars and eighty cents a barrel the gas was 
selling for 12 14 cents in mcf in fact in 19 69, I

05:02.768 --> 05:08.795
believe, was the lowest number of graduates in 
petroleum engineering that we ever had from A&M. I

05:08.875 --> 05:11.699
think we graduated 18 engineers. My graduating 
class, by contrast, we had 73 in my graduating

05:13.401 --> 05:18.928
class. 73 in the 50s? In petroleum engineering. 
Wow. So the market continued to be bad for several

05:23.113 --> 05:26.537
years? The market was, the industry was very 
depressed until 1973. Why was it depressed until

05:33.127 --> 05:34.789
73? There was an excess supply of oil. In fact, in 
the early 60s, there was so much excess oil that the

05:39.615 --> 05:50.709
Texas Railroad Commission prorated or limited 
the amount of production that could be produced.

05:51.890 --> 05:55.134
And they called it so many producing days. We got 
down as low as you could only produce eight days a

05:55.215 --> 05:59.640
month. and your wells had to be shut in the other 22 
days a month. Actually, they would let you prorate

06:04.978 --> 06:14.533
over the entire period, but you could only produce 
it like 25, 26% of what the well was capable of

06:04.978 --> 06:14.533
producing. Was there no proration before the 
1960s? No, there was proration, but we just had

06:17.017 --> 06:23.187
ended up with an excess, more and more excess oil. 
And so in order to keep the price from just

06:26.468 --> 06:32.674
absolutely going to 10 cents a barrel or 
something, then they cut back production and that

06:26.468 --> 06:32.674
stabilized the price. In fact, the Texas Railroad 
Commission, although they denied it, was the

06:33.374 --> 06:38.439
first OPEC. They were the first oil cartel all by 
themselves. So where was Texas oil coming from? If

06:44.224 --> 06:48.088
Texas was choked back, where was the oil coming 
from? Well, even at producing at that level of

06:48.108 --> 06:55.294
production, Texas is 35% of the total oil in the 
United States. And so choking Texas back to 25% of

06:55.882 --> 07:05.096
their capability, then we were producing only 
enough oil to meet the demand. But 75% of Texas

07:06.017 --> 07:11.505
production was shut in then. And so the industry 
was very depressed because we had an excess of oil

07:11.545 --> 07:18.295
and very low prices. a very low income level, and it 
stayed that way until 1973 when the Arabs put an

07:18.967 --> 07:29.141
embargo of oil on the United States. What year was 
OPEC formed? Well, it probably was formed in, I

07:31.404 --> 07:40.696
don't know, maybe prior to 1970, but they really 
did not have any power. I mean, we were importing

07:40.816 --> 07:46.864
probably 40% of our oil, but they actually cut off 
All of our supply, OPEC cut off all of our supply in

07:47.063 --> 07:51.350
1973. So before that, so OPEC first exercised its 
power in 1973. Before that, it didn't exercise its

07:57.141 --> 08:00.186
power either positively or negatively. That's 
correct. Okay. Their first impact was in 1973, and

08:02.209 --> 08:11.265
when they cut off the oil supply, we immediately 
had a monstrous gasoline shortage. there would be

08:12.022 --> 08:20.815
sometimes it would take you two or three hours of 
waiting in line just to get gasoline and that was

08:12.022 --> 08:20.815
common all over the United States in 1973. Price of 
oil immediately went to six dollars a barrel, went

08:22.397 --> 08:27.805
from less than three to over six dollars a barrel. 
At that point also Texas had run out of spare

08:29.026 --> 08:39.261
capacity and essentially was up to a hundred 
percent of capacity up from, remember they'd had

08:39.646 --> 08:46.372
75% of their production shut in in the late 50s, 
early 60s. So Texas was at 100% of capacity. The oil

08:50.676 --> 08:53.579
price had now doubled to $6 a barrel. So we began in 
73 to be really good economic years for the

08:54.420 --> 09:08.573
petroleum industry through 1985.

09:08.941 --> 09:10.663
A lot of new companies started in 1973? A lot of 
companies. Prior to 1973, we had about 4,000

09:13.125 --> 09:19.051
independent companies. By 1978, we had 12,000 
independent companies. Did they go big again?

09:29.281 --> 09:36.348
Well, we stayed at 12,000 until 1986 when the price 
of oil broke down dramatically. It came down from

09:38.354 --> 09:41.859
In 1981, it was $37 a barrel. It went down to $27 a 
barrel by 85. And then in January of 86, oil went to

09:46.245 --> 09:51.411
$10 to $12 a barrel. And by 1990, the 12,000 
independents had gone way down to about 4,000

09:52.573 --> 10:01.885
independents. We're probably about 3,000 today. 
How did the strategy of the majors change? Well,

10:11.630 --> 10:17.798
the majors of course increased their drilling 
budget dramatically. They began to drill what we

10:18.459 --> 10:26.549
call frontier basins in the United States that 
previously had not really been drilled. Some of

10:26.669 --> 10:32.557
these basins were like the deep smack over Norflet 
production in Alabama, Mississippi. These are

10:35.999 --> 10:39.746
oil and gas fields that are below 17,000-18,000 
feet. They began to drill the deep Anadarko. Why

10:43.092 --> 10:46.317
weren't they drilling gas in 1973? Well, the price 
of gas had gone up dramatically, too. Oil went up,

10:50.204 --> 10:52.809
it didn't go up as much as oil, did it? Yes, 
percentage-wise, the price of gas in 1967-68

11:00.434 --> 11:03.257
was about 26 cents. By 1971 it had gone up to 75 to 80 
cents. Now 73 had gone up to a dollar and a half. So it

11:14.390 --> 11:20.157
went up tenfold in a period of about five, six 
years. Why did gas demand go up so much? For a

11:23.441 --> 11:29.648
different reason from oil, is that there we 
thought that there was a great glut of gas in the

11:30.573 --> 11:42.564
United States, but beginning in 1971, and there 
was a lot of industries, and of course a lot of

11:30.573 --> 11:42.564
residential use of gas, we ran dramatically short 
of gas. The price of gas had been controlled solely

11:43.925 --> 11:58.538
by the Federal Power Commission, which is now the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and it was

11:43.925 --> 11:58.538
treated as a utility price, and it was strictly 
controlled by the federal government. Drilling

11:58.957 --> 12:05.050
for gas had lagged way behind, and we went 
dramatically short of gas. In fact, in the winter

12:05.110 --> 12:20.121
of 71-72,

12:05.110 --> 12:20.121
perhaps 72-73, we had such a shortage of gas that 
the University of Texas was actually shut down for

12:05.110 --> 12:20.121
over a week. The city of San Antonio was virtually 
shut down for over a week due to gas shortage. So at

12:26.706 --> 12:31.370
that time people were paying a buck and a half for 
gas and it was still controlled, still price

12:26.706 --> 12:31.370
controlled? Well there was intrastate gas that 
did not flow across the state boundaries, was not

12:31.390 --> 12:38.557
controlled. So as a consequence, very little new 
gas was committed to flow across state lines to

12:38.577 --> 12:46.665
like St. Louis or Chicago. and the utilization of 
it for a short period of time was solely within the

12:47.084 --> 12:53.976
state to get around cost control.

12:56.881 --> 12:57.001
I see. So, okay, so all embargo hits and everybody 
goes drilling. They didn't drill very many

13:02.050 --> 13:05.215
development fields, mostly frontiers? Well, you 
were asking about the change in strategy of the

13:05.235 --> 13:08.060
major. Is that? When their drilling budget went up 
dramatically, remember their cash flow has now

13:09.680 --> 13:15.927
more than doubled what it has been. And typically 
what we use is what we call a plowback ratio, is that

13:16.228 --> 13:27.741
the majors usually plow back about 50% of their 
total cash flow into new drilling activity. So

13:28.502 --> 13:34.229
they more than doubled their drilling budget in a 
very short period of time. They didn't have enough

13:34.249 --> 13:36.852
development drilling to be able to utilize that 
much cash flow. So that's why they started

13:40.384 --> 13:44.872
drilling the deep frontier type of prospects. 
Deep Rocky Mountains became very active which had

13:46.575 --> 13:50.864
not seen much activity. Offshore had a tremendous 
boom because offshore drilling had been very

13:51.845 --> 13:56.434
expensive. Did this drilling boom affect other 
industries in the U.S.? It affected, well,

14:02.228 --> 14:23.753
probably two major industries, the fabricating 
business that were building platforms and

14:02.228 --> 14:23.753
equipment, and it affected the service 
companies, which is the Halliburton's,

14:02.228 --> 14:23.753
Lumberjays, the people that are servicing the 
rigs and furnishing pipe and this type of thing.

14:24.714 --> 14:29.940
How did the employment in the industry change 
during the early drilling days? Employment in the

14:30.427 --> 14:38.976
petroleum industry in 1970 was probably around at 
the $300,000 mark. By 1975, it had grown to like

14:39.416 --> 14:45.502
$350,000, as I recall.

14:48.766 --> 14:49.747
Something on that order. Not a great change. Not a 
great change. Of course, we probably had a surplus

14:53.150 --> 14:56.714
of people actually coming into that. They just put 
them to work. Now, then the big buildup, was that by

15:00.515 --> 15:07.222
1981, we went from 350,000 to over 700,000 people. 
More than double the employment there in a six year

15:08.003 --> 15:11.006
period. Doesn't sound wise. No, it wasn't. The oil 
embargo ended in 74, is that right? It was very

15:16.932 --> 15:19.435
short, a short period of time. Probably ended in 
late 73 or early 74. How did strategy change then?

15:26.923 --> 15:28.885
Well, there was A general feeling that we could 
drill ourselves, well, I would say this is a

15:29.776 --> 15:44.539
consensus, but a lot of people thought that we 
could drill ourselves into what we call an

15:29.776 --> 15:44.539
independent state, that we would not have to 
import any oil. I was not one of those people. I

15:46.943 --> 15:52.872
never thought that we had enough reserves in the 
United States to become close to becoming

15:46.943 --> 15:52.872
independent. But there was a lot of drilling 
activity. A lot of it aimed domestically. The

15:58.177 --> 16:03.864
drilling budgets continued to increase, 
probably peaked out in about 1981 or 1982. Oil

16:03.924 --> 16:07.569
price fell back? The oil price peaked in 1981 at $37 
a barrel. To a climb from $73 to $81? Consistently,

16:14.978 --> 16:16.060
yes. Even after the embargo ended? Yes. Well, the 
reason is that OPEC had the threat of shutback all

16:19.224 --> 16:24.370
the time. And all they had to do was to curtail their 
production just a little bit, and they could run

16:25.379 --> 16:32.773
the price of oil up. Total production in the world 
is about, even then, was someplace in the low 60

16:33.334 --> 16:40.347
million barrels a day. OPEC controlled 25 million 
barrels a day. Texas Railroad Commission had

16:45.528 --> 16:50.334
controlled the price in the 40s, 50s, and 60s. Now 
OPEC can control the price by simply shutting back

16:50.955 --> 16:57.564
production the same way the Texas Railroad 
Commission did. So everybody was tens and

16:57.584 --> 17:00.067
therefore prices stayed high? Yes. There was 
plenty of oil. It was simply the threat of shutting

17:03.071 --> 17:05.855
it back. OPEC could do the same thing today. If 
OPEC, that's producing 24 million barrels a day,

17:08.799 --> 17:15.147
were to cut back a million barrels production, 
less than 5% of their production, the price of oil

17:16.055 --> 17:20.682
would go over $20 a barrel. It's currently about 
$17. They can increase the price of oil

17:23.687 --> 17:27.513
immediately in less than 24 hours. Incredible. So

17:30.117 --> 17:38.730
during this whole time, people are speculating 
and keeping prices high? The overwhelming

17:39.631 --> 17:43.918
consensus in the petroleum industry All of the 
projections, including the DOE, all of the major

17:44.590 --> 17:56.670
financial houses such as Barrel Lane, Solomon, in 
1980 are predicting by the mid-90s that oil will be

17:44.590 --> 17:56.670
$60 a barrel. So budgets were based, built on these 
price forecasts. The petroleum industry from

18:03.542 --> 18:10.834
1979 through 1985 overspent what their previous 
level of expenditures had been, about $20 million

18:11.438 --> 18:21.790
a year, they overspent $160 billion in 
exploration and development. And as a result,

18:23.552 --> 18:27.677
they got nothing for it. Looking over the table of 
numbers, I saw two years where there was an

18:27.697 --> 18:35.165
increased reserves and every other year it 
declined. Right. The first increase was 1979.

18:39.530 --> 18:41.592
That's the largest increase. It's about 10%. Was 
that infield drilling or was that new fields? A lot

18:50.521 --> 18:52.263
of it was infield drilling. Actually, where wells 
had been originally drilled on, say, 80-acre

18:52.383 --> 19:00.190
spacing, they came in and drilled them on 40-acre 
spacing. But you'll see that there's from 70... it

19:04.882 --> 19:17.320
was 27.1 billion barrels, and they increased it to 
80 to 29.8 billion, and essentially after that it

19:04.882 --> 19:17.320
began to decline with little blips in there. But 
while you're saying, remember we spent during

19:17.340 --> 19:26.513
that period of time $160 billion extra over our 
normal budget. So we're spending a lot more for

19:27.454 --> 19:28.937
almost nothing. Essentially nothing, yeah. I 
remember seeing a chart that showed major

19:31.375 --> 19:38.025
oilfield discoveries, fields discovered that 
were over 200 million barrels. And as I recall, the

19:38.626 --> 19:50.603
only fields of more than 200 million barrels 
discovered in the U.S. after the early 70s were

19:38.626 --> 19:50.603
Alaska. That's correct. So we've gone over the 
hump and found basically all the fields in the U.S.

19:56.672 --> 19:57.994
There's no question about that. We may have a few 
fields left primarily offshore, and a lot of it in

20:01.193 --> 20:13.147
very deep water, water as deep as 3,000 feet in the 
50 to 100 million barrel range. I do not know of any

20:13.708 --> 20:22.518
prospects today onshore that are greater than 25 
million barrels. Well, in the time period when

20:22.539 --> 20:30.508
prices were escalating, we were spending more 
money on research and development, or not

20:22.539 --> 20:30.508
research, but exploration and development. Was 
there anything the government could have done to

20:30.944 --> 20:36.529
keep the price down, or what did it do to keep the 
price down? Well, actually, the government

20:36.549 --> 20:42.675
really didn't do much to pricing. They did just the 
opposite effect. In 1980,

20:44.857 --> 20:59.770
thereabout, no, early 1973, they essentially put 
price controls on oil, in that all of your profit

20:44.857 --> 20:59.770
over a certain level was taxed by what they call a 
windfall profits tax up to 70%. For example, they

21:06.565 --> 21:11.571
said, we'll put a base on your oil at $6 a barrel. 
When oil went to $20 a barrel, the $14 a barrel was

21:12.252 --> 21:19.822
taxed away from the oil companies at 70%. So they 
didn't control the price of oil. They simply taxed

21:23.326 --> 21:26.550
away any excess income. They did not put an excise 
tax on gas. They still had price controls on most of

21:30.563 --> 21:38.279
the flowing gas in the United States as late as 
1989. It was controlled by the Natural Gas Policy

21:38.360 --> 21:43.430
Act. It was enacted in 1978. There were strict 
price controls on gas. What did the 78 Act do? Well,

21:53.056 --> 21:56.321
it put price controls on gas. Which hadn't been 
there before? Well, there were different types of

21:58.645 --> 22:01.049
price controls. We had area pricing rates. For 
example, in, say, the panhandle of Texas, you

22:03.854 --> 22:09.924
could sell gas for 15 cents. In South Texas, you 
could sell it for 14 cents. In 1978, they created

22:13.291 --> 22:21.822
some 20 different categories of gas depending 
upon the vintage and the depth. In other words,

22:21.842 --> 22:28.051
Wells Drill prior to 1978 got an old low price, 40 
cents. Wells Drill after 1978 got to sell for $2. So

22:32.136 --> 22:35.220
they had a nightmare of pricing. They said they had 
some 20 categories of gas. We actually identified

22:38.665 --> 22:42.690
37 different categories of gas. depending on 
depth, how close it was to another field, another

22:43.126 --> 22:52.076
well, date drilled, all types of things. So to a 
large extent, whatever the government did in

22:53.979 --> 23:07.294
respect to its foreign policy wouldn't have done 
that much to change the domestic oil and gas

22:53.979 --> 23:07.294
behavior because international politics didn't 
have a lot to do with their profits. Not really. I

23:09.012 --> 23:16.902
guess that they could have had some impact if they 
had threatened OPEC, you know, with force or

23:09.012 --> 23:16.902
something. And there was some early on, of course, 
there were some rumblings when they put an embargo

23:16.942 --> 23:22.330
on it. So we need to send the army in there and take 
over the fields in Saudi Arabia. But I don't think

23:28.758 --> 23:31.822
it had very much support, really. Probably been a 
good idea. It sounds nice. So when did, how long was

23:39.016 --> 23:42.880
gas regulation in place? Gas regulation was 
effectively in place from 1978 through 1989. All

23:47.946 --> 24:04.403
gas in the United States is now deregulated and 
what helped bring that on is that we thought that

23:47.946 --> 24:04.403
there was a tremendous shortage of gas and there 
was when they put the increased gas prices in

23:47.946 --> 24:04.403
effect in 1978. There was a big surge in drilling 
and by 1982

24:08.024 --> 24:36.681
or three in a very short period of time we had 
created a lot of gas reserves and 84 beginning in

24:08.024 --> 24:36.681
late 84 we had what we called a gas bubble we had an 
excess of gas supply in the united states so now gas

24:08.024 --> 24:36.681
begins to sell in 1985 below the ceiling prices 
that have been brought out to the government in

24:08.024 --> 24:36.681
other words they're not even selling at the 
highest price that you could sell for and the gas

24:37.032 --> 25:05.115
price continued to deteriorate from 85 finally in 
1989 congress says take all the controls off

24:37.032 --> 25:05.115
because we don't need them there's no gas being 
sold at those prices anyway so all gas today is

24:37.032 --> 25:05.115
deregulated so it was a one-step deal it started at 
78 and ended in 89 yes tell me about the type of gas

24:37.032 --> 25:05.115
contracts that existed before 1989 uh Actually, 
your contracts changed dramatically in 1985 when

25:06.293 --> 25:11.961
we had the excess. Prior to 1985, typically a gas 
contract to buy from any well was for a period of 15

25:13.503 --> 25:23.457
to 20 years, some of them for the duration of the 
life of the well. When we got to an excess of gas,

25:24.619 --> 25:29.466
then the gas companies that were buying the gas no 
longer wanted to be committed to long-term

25:30.239 --> 25:37.168
contracts because they had excess supply. The 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission passed a

25:38.390 --> 25:51.066
regulation that said that the customers were no 
longer obligated to honor their purchase

25:38.390 --> 25:51.066
contracts with the gas companies, that they could 
buy gas from anybody in the United States,

25:51.383 --> 26:02.276
regardless, even if they had committed 
themselves to buy gas from a gas company for 15

25:51.383 --> 26:02.276
years. They set aside those contracts. And the net 
effect of that is that it put all gas on what we call

26:05.260 --> 26:10.927
the spot market. And contracts, as we knew them 
prior to 1985, were essentially abandoned.

26:16.654 --> 26:20.479
Virtually all gas today is sold on a spot market. 
contract to sell your gas every month just for the

26:21.050 --> 26:27.259
next month. Was it better off for the buyers and 
better off for the sellers on the spot or on the

26:27.279 --> 26:33.128
long-term contract? Well, the seller, it was 
better off on the long-term contract because you

26:33.148 --> 26:39.638
knew what price that you were going to get for a long 
period of time. Were they going to get better

26:39.658 --> 26:41.400
prices too? They were going to get better prices 
under the contracts, but essentially all of those

26:41.420 --> 26:47.850
contracts have been set aside and court has just 
nullified many of them and said that you will sell

26:48.691 --> 27:16.386
your gas on the spot market at a lower price did the 
did the sellers sue oh yes there was billions and

26:48.691 --> 27:16.386
billions of dollars of litigation the producers 
that had long-term contracts early on won the

26:48.691 --> 27:16.386
lawsuits probably in the first year or so but after 
that they've consistently lost what was the

26:48.691 --> 27:16.386
result of that Well, the result of it, of course, is 
that it broke a lot of producers that had gone out

27:17.497 --> 27:29.455
and spent a lot of money drilling expensive wells 
in anticipation of selling their gas for $3. When

27:30.436 --> 27:41.332
the court sent their contract aside and they had to 
sell it for $1, $1.50, they could not pay their bank

27:30.436 --> 27:41.332
debt off that they'd incurred to drill the wells, 
and they went broke. The 80s saw a lot of buyouts and

27:41.352 --> 27:46.440
mergers. happen a lot in oil and gas? Yes, there was 
a tremendous consolidation in the 80s. Many major

27:54.107 --> 27:57.673
oil companies sold out. Marathon Oil Company sold 
out to U.S. Steel. Texas Oil and Gas sold out to U.S.

28:02.201 --> 28:04.926
Steel. Comico was taken over by DuPont. Gulf was 
taken over by Chevron. City service was taken over

28:13.488 --> 28:17.172
by Occidental. Would those have happened if gas 
had not been deregulated?

28:24.739 --> 28:25.219
Probably. It was inevitable. We had a lot of excess 
infrastructure in the petroleum industry, in the

28:27.341 --> 28:33.968
domestic industry. If you go back and look, you can 
see that oil production particularly has

28:33.988 --> 28:41.335
declined steadily. So there had to be some 
retrenchment. We simply had too much at the top,

28:44.840 --> 28:52.692
frankly, and maybe too many people at the bottom, 
too, and so this is what brought about the

28:44.840 --> 28:52.692
consolidations. And we're going to continue to 
have consolidations. Were the consolidations

28:55.096 --> 29:00.945
good for the industry?

29:00.965 --> 29:02.287
I would say they were necessary. If you lost your 
job, you know, you certainly didn't think it was

29:02.888 --> 29:10.900
good for the industry or good for anything, but 
there was just no question because the declining

29:11.133 --> 29:14.239
profitability, there had to be a consolidation. 
So in order to survive, to keep any type of

29:15.041 --> 29:20.571
profitability level, there had to be 
consolidation. And that probably would have

29:20.852 --> 29:24.218
happened even without deregulation. Yes. You 
said a lot of people lost their jobs during the

29:26.860 --> 29:30.125
restructuring? Oh gosh, 350,000 people. We've 
lost half of the industry since 1981. Was that

29:36.273 --> 29:38.516
because of restructuring or because of prices? Or 
were the two separate? Both. The prices continued

29:42.322 --> 29:44.645
to deteriorate. Production continued to 
decline. So obviously in order to keep some level

29:47.769 --> 29:56.682
of profitability, you had to have a whole lot less 
people, which is the single most expensive

29:47.769 --> 29:56.682
component in the production of oil and gas. I 
remember, back to the gas, which got me into that

29:58.113 --> 30:11.649
idea, I remember hearing that the pipelines were 
opened up and made available to every producer

29:58.113 --> 30:11.649
equally. That's correct. When did that happen? 
Well, actually, that was Order 636, and it just

30:15.253 --> 30:18.958
happened this last year. There's been a series of 
orders, but in effect, The whole structure of the

30:25.822 --> 30:41.783
gas pipeline industry, which is Enron, ANR, Texas 
Eastern, Panhandle Eastern, Florida Gas,

30:25.822 --> 30:41.783
Transwestern, El Paso, these are your major 
pipeline companies. They had served for many

30:41.803 --> 30:53.618
years prior to just last year's what we call 
merchant gas companies in that they went and

30:41.803 --> 30:53.618
signed up a lot of long-term contracts with lots of 
producers. They aggregated that gas, and then

30:54.374 --> 31:09.173
they turned around and made long-time sales 
contracts with a lot of major industries in a lot of

30:54.374 --> 31:09.173
major cities, Chicago, Detroit, New York, 
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and so on. With 636

31:09.193 --> 31:23.892
called the unbundling of services, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission said that the gas

31:09.193 --> 31:23.892
companies could no longer serve in a merchant 
function, that the end users of gas could contact

31:24.158 --> 31:41.315
the producer or any gas sales and buy gas directly 
from them and the gas pipeline that was hooked up to

31:24.158 --> 31:41.315
those wells was obligated to transport that gas to 
the customer. Now they could charge a

31:41.895 --> 31:51.725
transportation fee but at that point we no longer 
had merchant gas companies and essentially

31:41.895 --> 31:51.725
you've had producers selling directly to end 
users now. So were the Were the merchant gas

31:55.394 --> 32:00.160
transporters held liable for violation of 
contract? Oh, yes. They lost early on when the

32:02.744 --> 32:15.861
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first took 
the position that the end user, the customer, no

32:02.744 --> 32:15.861
longer had to satisfy their purchase contracts. 
They said, you're excused out of buying this gas,

32:15.882 --> 32:22.971
even though you've got 15 years left on it. The 
pipelines were not excused from their contracts

32:23.440 --> 32:28.428
from the producer. To buy. To buy. So there they had 
gone out and bought billions of dollars worth of

32:31.353 --> 32:40.006
gas under long-term contract, and they had no 
customer on the other end that was obligated to buy

32:31.353 --> 32:40.006
it. So did we lose a lot of gas transporters? We 
didn't lose. any gas transporters but they lost

32:45.901 --> 33:15.047
billions and billions of dollars columbia for 
example the major gas transmission line is in

32:45.901 --> 33:15.047
bankruptcy today transco came very close to 
bankruptcy the and the gas companies

32:45.901 --> 33:15.047
consistently lost their cases fighting the 
contracts in court with the producers in the early

32:45.901 --> 33:15.047
years in the last four or five years they've had a 
lot more success but they're still losing cases

32:45.901 --> 33:15.047
still losing cases so are these are Were they able 
to make a surcharge to the user to help pay for their

33:15.668 --> 33:21.978
indebtedness? No. They simply said the end user 
does not have to buy the gas anymore. They can buy it

33:27.306 --> 33:29.569
any place if they find it cheaper. But when the 
pipeline said, OK, we'll pass the second rule that

33:30.230 --> 33:41.648
lets us out of our contracts with the producer, the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told them,

33:30.230 --> 33:41.648
that's your problem. So why were the gas 
transporters the one that took the hit? Well,

33:45.115 --> 33:46.737
nobody really knows. Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission only addressed half of the problem and

33:47.358 --> 33:53.207
refused to address the other half of the problem. 
No understanding why? No. They just said, that's

33:55.931 --> 33:57.293
not our problem. Our problem is to protect the end 
user. And that's between the producer and the

34:01.079 --> 34:04.244
pipeline company. You'll just have to fight your 
problems out in court. How did the changes in

34:09.031 --> 34:13.738
bankruptcy law in the late 70s change our 
business?

34:18.359 --> 34:33.894
Probably the largest single change is they gave 
what we call in Chapter 11 presenting the debtor in

34:18.359 --> 34:33.894
possession a lot greater latitude than they had in 
previous years. For example, as companies began

34:34.895 --> 34:43.843
to go into bankruptcy, previous years they could 
be forced to sell their assets. And whatever they

34:43.963 --> 34:48.147
get for them, they give it to their creditors. In 
the late 70s, early 80s, Chapter 11 proceedings

34:48.987 --> 35:06.057
under the bankruptcy code would give the debtor in 
possession typically at least 18 months of

34:48.987 --> 35:06.057
continued operation before he had to satisfy any 
type of claims. At the end of 18 months, he had to

35:07.279 --> 35:13.510
come into court with what we'd call a plan of 
reorganization of saying, I'm going to pay off the

35:14.232 --> 35:18.159
secured creditors $0.25 on the dollars. The 
unsecured creditors, I'm going to give them $0.05

35:18.199 --> 35:24.170
on the dollar, and so on. So debtor in possession 
left the same management in the companies for much

35:24.190 --> 35:32.525
longer periods of time than it had previously. 
That was destructive to the industry? Oh, I don't

35:35.866 --> 35:38.250
know that it was so destructive. It just changed 
the way that you functioned in bankruptcy court.

35:43.097 --> 35:48.366
We didn't go through near as many liquidations 
after that particular change. I can't say that

35:48.646 --> 35:50.689
it's good or bad. How did the changes in the tax law 
in 1986 change the way we do business?

35:57.760 --> 36:03.409
And was 1986 the end of the 70% windfall tax? Yes, 
because when the price of oil went down, there was

36:03.997 --> 36:15.656
no oil being taxed above that level, so there was no 
need for a windfall profits tax, and it was phased

36:03.997 --> 36:15.656
out. Some of the things that have hurt, they phased 
out, maybe in the late 70s, early 80s, they phased

36:15.936 --> 36:26.213
out depletion allowance for all major oil 
companies. It had been 27.5% of gross income that

36:27.215 --> 36:31.101
was not taxed. It went to 15%, and then they took it 
to 0% for a major. Independence still had it. Then

36:39.414 --> 36:45.501
they put in preference tax items where all 
intangible drilling costs could not be deducted.

36:45.601 --> 36:48.144
It had to be capitalized.

36:49.185 --> 36:58.696
I don't think that the change in tax laws, it had an 
impact, a negative impact on the industry, but not

36:49.185 --> 36:58.696
an overwhelming impact. I mean, they could have 
lived with, if that was all that had been the

37:00.292 --> 37:02.836
problem. So the oil industry paid more taxes, 
especially the big oil companies paid more taxes?

37:08.725 --> 37:08.805
Yes. I mean, question, because they totally lost 
their depletion

37:08.865 --> 37:18.720
amounts. Have there been any debacles in foreign 
policy that have really screwed up our industry?

37:25.811 --> 37:26.692
It's hard to say. The accusation has been, and 
there may be some element of proof, that during

37:28.473 --> 37:40.765
Desert Storm, we were not really there, the 
accusation is, to protect Kuwait. Because

37:41.665 --> 37:50.594
Kuwait's got relatively few people, and there's a 
lot more injustices that have been done to people

37:41.665 --> 37:50.594
all over the world than there was in Kuwait. What we 
were really over there for was to protect our oil

37:51.234 --> 37:57.180
supply that was coming out of Saudi Arabia. I don't 
think that there's been any evidence to support

37:58.139 --> 38:16.643
it, but the allegation now from some corners is 
that Saudi made a deal to continue to produce at

37:58.139 --> 38:16.643
maximum rates since Desert Storm, since we sent 
our people over there really to protect their

37:58.139 --> 38:16.643
country. Them producing at maximum rate has 
depressed the price of oil dramatically, and that

38:18.445 --> 38:27.437
was their deal, is that they said, okay, if you'll 
come over here and and protect us. We'll pump oil at

38:29.436 --> 38:31.178
a maximum rate. The price of oil will stay way down. 
You're importing a lot of oil, and that would be

38:33.420 --> 38:36.583
good for the United States. It's very detrimental 
to the petroleum industry, but probably very

38:37.364 --> 38:43.230
favorable to the rest of the consumer.

38:46.373 --> 38:54.100
I heard, as recently as last summer, that OPEC had 
adopted a long-term strategy of keeping the price

38:46.373 --> 38:54.100
of oil about $20. so that alternative energy 
wouldn't develop and they could maintain a large

38:54.350 --> 39:01.621
energy market share for the long term. Are they 
abandoning that strategy now? Well, they

39:03.744 --> 39:05.787
certainly have on the short term. OPEC and Saudi is 
producing at a very high rate. They could run the

39:12.898 --> 39:17.805
price of oil back up to $20 a barrel if they'd shut 
back 5%. But in the past, Almost a year now, they

39:21.063 --> 39:22.826
have not done it. Price of oil has been as low as $12, 
$13 a barrel in the United States. Currently, the

39:28.575 --> 39:30.859
posted price is $17. The actual field price is 
probably about $15, $16. That's for West Texas?

39:36.848 --> 39:37.029
Yes. What's going to happen when Iraq comes online 
and then when the Soviet Union comes back online?

39:43.928 --> 39:46.091
Well, let's talk about Iraq first. If Iraq comes on 
and they can probably put as much as 3 million

39:46.131 --> 39:56.745
barrels a day, if nobody else cuts back, price will 
go to $10 a barrel.

39:57.246 --> 40:04.156
If they were to come back on and OPEC kept their 
production rate very high, price of oil will

39:57.246 --> 40:04.156
plummet. Soviet Union will not come back on. I've 
been in Russia for over two months. I've looked at

40:09.002 --> 40:11.826
hundreds and hundreds of wells Their production 
went from 12 million barrels down to 6.5 million

40:12.329 --> 40:16.113
barrels. Over what time? Over about a four-year, 
five-year period. The story that you read in the

40:21.259 --> 40:27.947
paper is that these wells have minor mechanical 
problems, and they just need a little help. And the

40:28.928 --> 40:35.856
fact is that those wells have fatal flaw problems, 
is that they've got poor quality pipe. Their

40:36.296 --> 40:38.539
cement jobs are almost nonexistent. The only way 
to fix those wells is to plug them and totally

40:39.329 --> 40:44.195
re-drill them. The Soviet Union, to get their 
production level back, probably needs a minimum

40:44.695 --> 40:53.185
of $50 billion of drilling activity. Billion? 
Billion. How much did you say we spent? We spent

40:56.449 --> 41:00.153
$160 billion over a six-year period. And the 
Soviet Union needs a minimum of $50 billion, and at

41:01.174 --> 41:06.400
this point, on any joint ventures formed over 
there, they've got a minimum of $6 a barrel tax on

41:07.375 --> 41:14.142
it. So their tax rate is so high that they're simply 
not economical to drill in Russia today. So

41:20.048 --> 41:23.592
they're asking American producers to produce at 
$6 a barrel? Well, to start with, the Americans in

41:23.692 --> 41:31.000
the joint ventures are required to put up 100% of 
the money. They only get half of the oil. Just to

41:34.190 --> 41:39.157
start with, you're selling oil on the Black Sea for 
$9 a barrel. You only get, I mean, for $18 a barrel,

41:40.499 --> 41:44.164
you only get half of it. That's nine. It costs

41:46.027 --> 41:55.640
$3 a barrel to transport it from Siberia, which is 
their major producing area, to the Black Sea. So

41:55.681 --> 41:56.942
that leaves you with six. Tax is $6 a barrel. That 
leaves you with nothing. And we haven't even

42:00.668 --> 42:03.792
talked about operating costs yet. So there's not a 
lot of people rushing over there? No. Soviet

42:07.911 --> 42:18.222
production is not going to go back to 10 to 12 
million barrels a day, in my opinion, in the

42:07.911 --> 42:18.222
foreseeable future. Should the federal 
government do something to help oil companies get

42:19.584 --> 42:26.631
in over there, or should they do something to keep 
oil companies out? Well, I don't know whether it

42:27.853 --> 42:32.918
should be the federal government's part. 
worldwide economics dictate what should be done.

42:36.666 --> 42:48.201
Obviously, if the government paves the way for big 
infusions of capital into the Soviet Union, that

42:36.666 --> 42:48.201
money is going to stay in the Soviet Union.

42:51.425 --> 42:58.855
The problem with investments in the Soviet Union 
is that we have not seen any type of proposal where

42:51.425 --> 42:58.855
you're going to bring capital out of Russia. 
Essentially, when you go over there and drill,

42:59.678 --> 43:11.090
then you're going to reinvest your cash flow into 
some type of Russia infrastructure, which is

42:59.678 --> 43:11.090
going to be refining transportation type of 
facilities. So in effect, you're exporting a lot

43:11.110 --> 43:22.642
of US capital and a lot of US jobs to Russia, which 
are going to be filled by Russians, not by

43:11.110 --> 43:22.642
Americans. There seems to be a movement in a lot of 
oil companies to produce abroad. Yes. And how does

43:30.037 --> 43:36.006
that affect U.S. jobs, and how does that affect 
U.S. tax revenue? Well, we obviously are

43:37.629 --> 43:43.037
exporting jobs and exporting taxes to foreign 
countries. It's just that simple. Because once

43:45.841 --> 43:48.966
you spend the money over there, they're going to be 
taxed over there. Those tax credits apply for U.S.

43:50.589 --> 43:53.072
taxes. The U.S. might get some tax dollars, but it 
would be greatly diminished from what we would if

43:59.298 --> 44:01.821
it were generated in the United States. But also 
those jobs are exported. When we go overseas and

44:03.703 --> 44:13.975
you go out location, you look at production 
facilities, at most you'll see 10% Americans.

44:14.235 --> 44:21.183
You're going to see 90% of the people that are 
working there are nationals, which is probably

44:14.235 --> 44:21.183
what they should be. But that means you just 
exported those jobs. You also export the support

44:23.927 --> 44:26.790
people, which is the dry cleaner, the grocery 
store, the filling station man. You export the

44:33.489 --> 44:37.315
whole community overseas when you go into this 
type of thing. What about equipment? Are we

44:38.196 --> 44:40.680
exporting steel jobs? Is the steel coming from 
somewhere else? No. Any country that is capable of

44:42.584 --> 44:51.598
producing steel or has ties to another company 
closer than they do to the United States will use

44:42.584 --> 44:51.598
steel from there. For example, when you go into 
Russia, you might bring in some steel from the

44:55.154 --> 44:59.220
United States. But sooner or later, there's going 
to be a deal. They'll have to get their steel up to

45:02.805 --> 45:04.908
specs. They're going to insist on furnishing the 
pipe themselves.

45:11.097 --> 45:13.780
They're going to do as much for themselves as they 
possibly can. What Russia wants from the United

45:14.822 --> 45:18.908
States is one thing, money. They don't want our 
technology. They don't want advice. They just

45:23.334 --> 45:24.115
want money. They want to set up their own company. 
That's correct. And you pay for it.

45:34.586 --> 45:38.892
So what does the industry look like for the next 
five years? Industry will continue. Domestic

45:43.098 --> 45:46.022
industry will continue to go through downsizing. 
We will lose probably in the neighborhood of eight

45:52.546 --> 46:21.287
percent to ten percent of our workforce each year 
the domestic budget will decline at the rate

45:52.546 --> 46:21.287
currently running about 20 billion dollars a year 
for production exploration it will decline also

45:52.546 --> 46:21.287
at about that same rate so we'll probably get down 
to a bedrock budget of around 10 billion dollars

45:52.546 --> 46:21.287
compared to the current 20 billion dollars We're 
essentially going to continue to go through

46:22.280 --> 46:26.106
restructuring. Major oil companies will 
continue to transfer oil properties by sales to

46:26.186 --> 46:35.920
mid-sized to smaller independent companies. 
Will those independents explore or will they just

46:35.941 --> 46:39.967
produce? No, they'll just produce out what we've 
got. There will be very little exploration. Do you

46:44.093 --> 46:45.775
expect the number of independents to grow? 
Probably.

46:50.512 --> 46:57.238
There is a size really that is a more efficient 
size. When you get too small, you don't have the

46:57.258 --> 46:59.900
staff capability. Probably the most efficient 
size of independent that is not going to explore is

46:59.920 --> 47:08.108
in the range of $50 to $150 million in assets. That 
means about how many people?

47:14.453 --> 47:19.658
Counting field people in the neighborhood of 50 to 
150 people. What

47:20.836 --> 47:26.155
about long term, the next 40 years?
