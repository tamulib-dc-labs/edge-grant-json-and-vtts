WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:13.551
What

00:02.478 --> 00:13.551
did Coach Chandler say about your project, your 
proposal, your final product? Oh, he loved it. I

00:13.951 --> 00:22.401
mean, the best compliment he paid me was when I was 
taking my son down to get enrolled in school, and I

00:13.951 --> 00:22.401
said, let's go over and see Coach. He's out there 
watching him work out. He's there every day. I call

00:26.946 --> 00:29.008
and make sure he's over there watching him work 
out. And actually, my son was in school. And they

00:33.772 --> 00:37.856
were practicing for baseball. And this was, I'm 
trying to get my time straight. It was the spring.

00:44.523 --> 00:47.767
We went down for spring visitation. My son was a 
senior in high school. We took him down to see the

00:50.049 --> 00:51.350
campus. And I called Tom. He said, well, I'm going 
to be over at the baseball field watching them work

00:53.733 --> 00:56.516
out. Come on over there. So we went over there. It's 
amazing what they do to work out today. But Tom's

01:01.675 --> 01:07.785
down there, and we go down there sitting next to 
him, and he talks to Tony a little bit, my son. He

01:07.805 --> 01:08.706
says, you know what? He says, we wouldn't be 
sitting here if it weren't for your dad. He says,

01:12.552 --> 01:16.339
he's the one that inspired this thing right here. 
He said, oh, he did a model. that oh all the lights

01:20.103 --> 01:25.378
came on, and we didn't have lights, we didn't have 
anything when we played baseball. There was no

01:25.639 --> 01:27.183
such thing as playing at night. He said, oh it was 
just, you know how Tom used to talk, oh it was the

01:28.026 --> 01:34.905
most wonderful thing. And he said, oh, when Mr. 
Olson came in and he put up so much money, we

01:35.442 --> 01:40.509
couldn't take it. We couldn't resist it. So, you 
know, he says, your dad was an inspiration for

01:42.171 --> 01:44.934
this. And I thank him so much. I see him. Every time I 
see him, I thank him for this wonderful feat. So

01:51.243 --> 01:53.666
that was the best compliment. And my son's eyes lit 
up, you know, because I kept telling him, you know,

01:53.886 --> 01:59.573
my dad's full of bull. He didn't, you know, he did a 
Mickey Mouse little thing. He said, I know my dad.

02:03.438 --> 02:04.219
He didn't do this. And it was. it was good for him to 
hear that because it was something that he

02:05.193 --> 02:11.180
remembered and he'll remember forever. Alright, 
looking back now more than 20 years, if you were

02:11.200 --> 02:21.233
designing that stadium again, is there any change 
you would make? No, I think they were at the crux. I

02:25.498 --> 02:27.741
mean they took my idea and moved it to where 
stadiums are now. If you notice that the stadium is

02:29.423 --> 02:31.909
real tight. You're right on top of the game. You're 
enjoying, you know, you can hear everything the

02:33.332 --> 02:36.939
coaches say. And I think they took what I had in mind 
to what Tom wants. Tom says, I want to hear somebody

02:42.329 --> 02:46.895
in the stands say, Chandler don't know what he's 
talking about. Tom would say that kind of stuff. He

02:48.797 --> 02:53.122
says, I want to hear what they're saying because, 
you know, there's some pretty smart people up

02:48.797 --> 02:53.122
there. He says, and I want them to hear me when I yell 
at the umpire. I want them to hear every word I say.

02:57.908 --> 03:03.514
So he really wanted that feel of the fans being part 
of the game. And I think that's what that field

03:03.554 --> 03:05.436
turned out to be. Did you use anybody else's 
stadium as kind of a model? Well, we looked at a lot

03:11.377 --> 03:28.284
of pictures, a lot of schematics, and most of them, 
if you look at Dodger Stadium with their foil and

03:11.377 --> 03:28.284
everything, we took an adaptation of that and 
several other things to create that overhang and

03:11.377 --> 03:28.284
give the field some noise. And we really needed to 
create some noise, and Aggies are known for their

03:28.345 --> 03:36.017
noise, so you had to create that in that stadium, 
which is what we were trying to do. Are there any,

03:36.520 --> 03:43.623
have you been contacted by anybody else that was 
planning a stadium? No, I never did. I mean, it

03:45.810 --> 03:46.733
never got out. It was something I did just for time. 
I never put it out. Oh, that's, you've really,

03:50.155 --> 03:55.262
that's a special, special addition. Okay, your 
junior, senior years, and you get your degree in?

04:02.993 --> 04:03.654
December. December. And that's December of 73.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.247
When did you buy that ring?

04:16.532 --> 04:18.795
Well, the former students helped me. I got it my 
junior year, at the end of my junior year. You

04:22.088 --> 04:24.030
remember how much it cost? $56 or something like 
that. And was it your money? Yes, it was. How did you

04:27.794 --> 04:29.496
feel when you first put it on? Well, you know, my 
brother's is worse than mine, but you never like to

04:30.196 --> 04:36.123
take it off. You always want to just keep it there. 
Do you have any good Aggie ring stories?

04:41.068 --> 04:44.131
Everywhere I go, somebody sees me, or I see them. 
So, you know, it's one of those things you can

04:44.151 --> 04:47.955
always – come up to Nagy and talk to him. Have you 
been somewhere on the other side of the world or?

04:54.235 --> 04:56.377
No, we haven't traveled that much. He's got me a 
first class ticket every once in a while when a

04:56.397 --> 05:08.369
pilot's in Nagy and sees these rings and says we 
need to get him up here and give him some better

04:56.397 --> 05:08.369
seats.

05:08.509 --> 05:14.715
Let's see, so you didn't buy senior boots but how 
did you feel when you put that ring on for the first

05:08.509 --> 05:14.715
time? Very proud. My brother had one. See, my 
brother had his and he had, you know, just, you

05:17.635 --> 05:25.264
know, he'd never taken off and a pro baseball 
player running all around the country. He got a

05:25.324 --> 05:26.024
lot. So, yeah, I got my ring and I was very proud and I 
went home and, you know, to come from El Paso, to get

05:26.725 --> 05:35.495
that, you know, be that close, you know, I was very 
proud.

05:39.819 --> 05:44.364
Since you weren't in the Corps, there was no final 
review, but do you remember your commencement?

05:44.604 --> 05:45.145
Yes, I do. describe it? It was the only time my 
parents came to A&M when I was in college. Really?

05:52.846 --> 05:54.788
So they came down with my grandparents. No, just my 
parents. My parents came down for my graduation

05:57.472 --> 06:02.839
and my dad was amazed and my mom was amazed. They 
went back and saw all the old stuff to my brother

06:02.859 --> 06:07.825
where they'd seen my brother and of course it all 
changed. It changed significantly since he was

06:07.845 --> 06:10.529
there. And went to commencement and I don't for the 
life of me, I can't remember who spoke, but my dad

06:15.297 --> 06:25.910
was proud because he never imagined me getting a 
degree from anywhere, much less Texas A&M. We went

06:27.191 --> 06:33.579
back to my dorm room, my future wife, my girlfriend 
was there, and they're all laughing at me. I mean,

06:33.599 --> 06:40.067
they're literally all laughing at me because I got 
this degree in my hand, and none of them can believe

06:33.599 --> 06:40.067
I earned it. They still think I slid by, but It was a, 
of course there weren't that many in the fall. I

06:47.205 --> 06:51.169
mean there were probably three or four, five 
hundred is all that graduated. So it was a real

06:51.249 --> 06:57.174
little, you know, sit at G. Raleigh White. But I 
remember I had my cap and gown and I was not going to

06:58.275 --> 07:03.680
miss it. I wasn't just going to get my degree and 
leave. I wanted to be part of that. And was it

07:07.263 --> 07:10.786
special that it was your diploma inside that too? 
Absolutely. Every hand was shaken. Every hand was

07:15.333 --> 07:16.075
shaken. Every name was called. That's right. Do 
you remember any pranks, jokes, or foolishness?

07:23.655 --> 07:24.518
You know what? There was none of that. No hat 
throwing, no nothing. I mean, everybody just was

07:27.726 --> 07:30.293
very, very, you know. One of the worries now, they 
moved over to the new field house, and now more than

07:31.977 --> 07:42.950
half of the people walk off the stage out of the 
building. They don't go back to their seats. And

07:44.872 --> 07:46.995
that's unheard of. You get used, you wait for 
everybody else. Let's try to summarize all this.

07:53.422 --> 07:57.007
What creates Aggie spirit, that loyalty? I think 
the school creates it first. They have honor.

08:02.335 --> 08:03.356
They've kept their honor. They've kept their 
standards high. And when you're part of that, you

08:06.299 --> 08:10.702
have that same honor and spirit. So when a school 
keeps itself above the fray, keeps itself out of

08:11.103 --> 08:18.950
the gutter, you're proud to be part of it. You want 
to be part of it. So that creates this feeling

08:20.311 --> 08:27.057
inside that I'm proud of this because they've been 
able to do that. I don't know if it's called

08:27.077 --> 08:31.701
conservatism or whatever, but they haven't 
fallen to the same class of all the other schools in

08:32.339 --> 08:37.747
the country, most of them. They've kept 
themselves above it. And I think that's one of the

08:40.311 --> 08:43.155
things that makes you proud. Their standards, 
they get higher and higher every year. They want to

08:47.681 --> 08:53.410
achieve more than, they don't want to be a typical 
state school. They want to be above that. So I think

08:54.772 --> 08:59.258
when the leadership of the school strives for 
something greater, I think, Everybody that

08:59.845 --> 09:05.472
follows, everybody that wants to be a part of it, 
everybody that's there is going to strive for

08:59.845 --> 09:05.472
something greater. Now as you look back, what did 
you learn at Texas A&M that's been important to you

09:06.934 --> 09:13.241
since then? I think the best, the greatest thing I 
learned is where I belong in life. What they taught

09:20.150 --> 09:24.195
me was this is where you need to be to be successful. 
I think they saw that. I think they helped with

09:26.298 --> 09:28.300
that. I think learning and meeting new people that 
were totally foreign to me. I mean, East Texans to a

09:35.472 --> 09:38.317
West Texan is a foreigner. So meeting and enjoying 
those people and feeling a part, them making me

09:38.477 --> 09:48.996
feel a part of, you know, you need to be here. You 
need to, you know, this is where you should be and

09:49.016 --> 09:51.801
everything. So that kind of thing really helps. 
Who were the people that most deserve your

09:54.031 --> 09:57.977
gratitude? Well, Tom Chandler for one. Larry 
Priestmeyer.

10:05.888 --> 10:17.625
Pat Jenkins, my two or three roommates who knew me, 
didn't know me from Adam and ended up living with me

10:05.888 --> 10:17.625
for years and putting up with me for years because I 
was a slob.

10:18.078 --> 10:31.538
I think those people, the Daces, the people around 
Bryant, the families that live there, work there,

10:18.078 --> 10:31.538
have their livelihoods there, that take kids in, 
that for the most part support those kids. I think a

10:31.638 --> 10:40.491
lot of students don't appreciate what the 
families that have been there for years have had to

10:41.197 --> 10:42.559
to go through to stay there. I'm sure if you look at 
downtown Bryan, you think I get teary-eyed when I

10:42.959 --> 10:49.409
see downtown Bryan. I want to go back down there and 
just rehab it. So I think that kind of stuff is what.

10:57.720 --> 11:09.217
If you were a consultant to the A&M leadership 
today to advise them on what they should do and not

10:57.720 --> 11:09.217
do to keep A&M headed upward, what advice would you 
give them? Don't get elitist. I think it's the

11:11.167 --> 11:14.872
common folk that keep you there. I think they've 
tried. I think Ray Bowen has tried to realize that

11:17.376 --> 11:24.025
if you've got some Aggie blood in you, you're 
bringing something else to the game. I think that

11:24.566 --> 11:27.810
kind of thinking helps. You don't want to lower 
your standards to keep that, but you want to

11:28.091 --> 11:37.444
encourage... all of the former students. It's 
like our struggle here in Albuquerque when we

11:39.347 --> 11:49.778
can't get enough of the Aggies here to support us 
and be part of it until it's time for their kids to go

11:39.347 --> 11:49.778
to A&M. And all of a sudden they're very interested 
in it. And you try and tell them when they first

11:52.121 --> 11:58.228
started, you said, look, you've got to tell your 
kids now. You've got to get your kids going now. And

12:00.971 --> 12:04.335
don't plan on just waltzing in like you and I did. I 
mean, it's not going to happen. That's the most

12:07.023 --> 12:25.443
important thing to tell even graduating 
students, to say, look, you're going to have a

12:07.023 --> 12:25.443
family in a couple of years, and when your kids 
start into high school, start into whatever, you

12:07.023 --> 12:25.443
need to prepare them then to get into A&M and then to 
make this school greater and bigger and better. We

12:25.543 --> 12:27.905
need to have the smartest kids. But we need to have 
smart kids that are Aggies, that have marine blood

12:27.925 --> 12:31.950
in them. That's kind of what I still think. If you 
could make a major gift to A&M, that's somebody

12:36.453 --> 12:48.806
hands you a million dollar check and it's to go to 
A&M but you've got to control it, what would you

12:36.453 --> 12:48.806
want that money to be used for? Corps of Cadets. But 
you weren't in the Corps.

12:54.933 --> 12:57.215
And what would you, you mean Corps scholarships?

13:02.721 --> 13:02.801
Yep. What have we left out? That's about it. I mean, 
taking my son down there is the proudest day of my

13:05.814 --> 13:09.619
life. Seeing him get in. You mean taking him down 
there to enroll? Yeah. Did you give him any advice

13:16.387 --> 13:19.390
when you drew him up? No, it's funny. The funny 
story is we went down there and of course we went to

13:20.071 --> 13:25.257
visit in the spring. He applied early and got 
accepted. And being out of state, it's hard to get

13:29.282 --> 13:32.025
in that school. So he got in, applied at one school, 
Texas A&M, got in. Took him down there and he didn't

13:38.328 --> 13:42.054
go to fish camp. We really didn't get him to know 
that he should go to fish camp. But we walk in and

13:48.686 --> 13:54.275
going through all the rigmarole and now it comes to 
housing. And of course they're pounding on you the

13:54.295 --> 13:57.220
whole time. He was going to try and walk on the 
baseball team. He was a pitcher. He had

14:00.982 --> 14:04.714
scholarships at several other colleges, major 
colleges. He could have gone to play baseball. He

14:06.579 --> 14:07.582
did not accept them. He went to A&M. But he was 
intent on walking on to that baseball team. And so

14:13.720 --> 14:17.223
he could have gone to the honors dorm. He had enough 
schooling and he had the brains to go in that dorm.

14:23.048 --> 14:26.652
We wanted him to go into, what's the athletic dorm 
now? Where the football players are? Kane. Kane.

14:30.655 --> 14:35.359
Because they allow non-reg, I mean they have to to 
keep it all NCAA. But he was thinking he was going to

14:35.420 --> 14:38.562
be able to go into Kane. And we had talked to Tom 
Chandler. We had gone and talked to Coach Baseball

14:40.364 --> 14:43.727
Team.

14:45.749 --> 14:48.994
Jim Lawler says, well, we can do whatever we can do. 
We'll try and get you in. And of course, we're

14:51.277 --> 14:52.239
sitting there. And the advisor, one of the guys 
doing all the counseling, goes, OK, you got two

14:52.259 --> 14:58.509
minutes.

15:01.713 --> 15:03.696
Wherever you're going to live, you got two 
minutes. If you're going to be in the Corps, you go

15:04.217 --> 15:06.701
over there. If you're going to be a civilian, you go 
over there. You got two minutes to decide. And our

15:11.809 --> 15:13.191
son is sitting there. You know, sitting there, 
sitting there, sitting there. And our wish was for

15:15.942 --> 15:17.765
him to be in the Corps. I was never in the Corps, but I 
admired him. I wanted him to be in the Corps. And I

15:22.852 --> 15:24.615
guess it comes from my grandfather. But he looks 
over at his mom and he says, I think I'm going to go to

15:25.116 --> 15:30.503
the Corps. And she started crying. Oh, that's just 
wonderful. And we didn't try to influence him. But

15:36.893 --> 15:38.976
we went to the Corps Center. And Larry Priesmar had 
done a lot of the wood carving. And I can't remember

15:42.140 --> 15:43.482
the the gentleman who ran the court, the curator, 
he just passed away, he talked to Tony for a good two

15:44.170 --> 15:54.960
hours and told him all the good stories about the 
court, all about Good Bull and everything else. So

15:54.980 --> 15:59.344
Tony said, ah, these guys, you know, I want to play 
baseball. I want to play baseball. So we said, he's

16:00.225 --> 16:01.506
not going to go to the court. And when he turned and 
said, I'm going to go to the court, we went over

16:02.907 --> 16:13.317
there, and two days later, he's sitting in his dorm 
room, fastening his fasteners, you know, after we

16:02.907 --> 16:13.317
had the lead. The first sergeant came in, called 
Rick, came in and just reamed him up now inside the

16:14.005 --> 16:19.212
other. He's sitting inside of his closet. He says, 
well, son, we're going back to Albuquerque. He

16:23.638 --> 16:25.501
says, is there anything you want to say? He says, 
yeah. He says, what's wrong? He says, what do you

16:27.684 --> 16:29.166
think? He says, I'm thinking, what the hell am I 
doing here? And we left with smiles on our face

16:34.213 --> 16:39.861
because we knew they were going to take care of him. 
And that's the way my parents felt. My parents

16:41.940 --> 16:48.189
didn't even need to go because they knew that Texas 
A&M was going to take care of our child. And I think

16:49.231 --> 16:51.394
that's the best thing you can do. And what class was 
he? He was class of 99. 99. And what's he doing now?

16:56.340 --> 16:57.702
He works for Compaq Computer. He's a computer 
engineer. Where? In Houston. In Houston. Okay.

17:02.329 --> 17:05.253
And his wife is a summa cum laude. She's in chemical 
engineering. She works for Exxon. So they've got

17:09.338 --> 17:16.825
some pretty good degrees and a pretty good basis.

17:17.025 --> 17:25.773
Unless you know of anything else we've omitted, my 
last question is, what feelings do you carry in

17:17.025 --> 17:25.773
your heart now for Texas A&M? Love it. You know, 
when I got out of college for the first four or five

17:28.235 --> 17:34.961
or six years, it was kind of like it didn't teach me 
anything. I didn't learn a damn thing down there.

17:38.110 --> 17:42.838
And 30 years of working, it's taught me a lot. I did 
learn a lot. I learned quite a lot. And it takes you a

17:46.183 --> 17:49.930
while when you're that young to not realize what 
you really learned. I just love it. I mean, we do

17:51.733 --> 17:53.916
everything. We started this club up here. We got, 
you know, scholars. We did a lot in Albuquerque for

17:58.083 --> 18:00.227
Texas A&M. We got some good people down there, and I 
think we're going to continue to do that.
