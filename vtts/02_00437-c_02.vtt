WEBVTT

00:07.540 --> 00:19.293
This is very important historically because, 
like we said, like I said before, movies, TV were

00:07.540 --> 00:19.293
glamorizing SAC. And they were getting the

00:21.015 --> 00:36.332
publicity during the 1950s as being, I guess, as 
being the elite of the armed forces. Would you

00:36.599 --> 00:38.401
agree with that? I was going to say, and probably 
rightfully so. Because, you know, this was after

00:42.886 --> 00:58.202
the war and everything was being cut back, budget 
being cut back, and get back to this old bit of

00:42.886 --> 00:58.202
during time peace where everybody fights for 
their dollar to grow the budget. And, you know, it

00:58.222 --> 01:05.830
immediately started and the Army was clamoring 
for to keep so many divisions and so many tanks and

01:06.265 --> 01:08.928
so forth. The Navy wanted to keep so many ships and 
so forth. And we Air Force wanted an air defense

01:12.692 --> 01:17.558
command as well as SAC, as well as TAC. And, you 
know, somebody had to give someplace and

01:18.378 --> 01:22.503
compromise some way. But we in the Air Force, from 
the chief on down, that's where we got the basic

01:23.044 --> 01:35.057
guidance from the chief of staff of the Air Force 
that SAC And the nuclear capability, if you will,

01:36.117 --> 01:41.944
strategic capability was top priority. And for a 
while it was a little bit hard for tactical

01:43.326 --> 01:53.800
commanders, namely air defense and tactical 
command, to swallow. See, we were trying to build

01:53.860 --> 01:56.263
up the tactical air command. I mean the air defense 
command, NORAD.

02:01.328 --> 02:03.391
Of course, this was to give warning to SAC. So you 
see, there was arguments for giving us money. We

02:06.977 --> 02:12.605
had to give warning to SAC so they could get on, so 
they could do their job. So you had a rivalry right

02:12.625 --> 02:17.272
in your arms? Rivalry is the best thing to call it, 
for the dollars. Sure. Rivalry for the dollars.

02:22.019 --> 02:25.665
And SAGE cost us billions and billions of dollars. 
SAGE? SAGE, the Automatic Guidelines. Were you

02:31.720 --> 02:34.743
yourself jealous of the Strategic Air Command? A 
little bit. Looking back now, I just plain old

02:36.545 --> 02:41.070
professional jealousy. In times I remember 
making a comment, they act like they're not even in

02:41.330 --> 02:47.456
the regular Air Force, they're a separate Air 
Force. And I think that's out of temperament and

02:47.476 --> 02:51.781
professional jealousy. Did you ever want to apply 
for a SAT? I didn't like the philosophy of command

02:58.163 --> 03:05.535
that they used in SAC. Which was? Fear.

03:11.525 --> 03:24.627
I had served

03:11.525 --> 03:24.627
under ex-SAC people in my subsequent career after 
in the latter part of my Air Force career.

03:29.939 --> 03:40.830
philosophy of command, and for a while it darn near 
demoralized the tactical

03:29.939 --> 03:40.830
aircraft. Fortunately, that commander didn't 
stay long, and so we had another typical tactical

03:40.850 --> 03:49.519
aircraft commander, John Displey, who took over 
and got things back on an even keel. And this gets

03:50.540 --> 03:54.204
into the philosophy of command maybe you want to 
talk about later on. Well, tell me about fear.

03:55.845 --> 03:59.389
Well, give me an example of that in the strategic 
air command.

04:03.031 --> 04:11.002
You do a job, if you have an accident, this man does 
that, you're fired. You're ruined. You're career

04:11.523 --> 04:12.444
is over. And you heard SAC commanders say that to a 
man? This was the philosophy of SAC. But you

04:19.515 --> 04:21.477
yourself heard that? Almost. Oh, yes.

04:29.008 --> 04:32.413
Many people in airports at that time felt that. I 
don't blame this on LeMay. Who do you blame it on?

04:37.675 --> 04:40.178
Other officers in the SAC hierarchy.

04:42.261 --> 04:43.643
I don't think that exists now. As a matter of fact,

04:43.663 --> 04:51.272
SAC has changed now, and they don't have this 
philosophy anymore. We don't have this feeling in

04:51.292 --> 04:54.216
the Air Force anymore, to my knowledge. We know the 
requirements of having SAC. There's no doubt of

04:59.543 --> 05:02.046
the puts of And now, you know, we've even got the 
intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are

05:02.633 --> 05:07.879
still part of SAC. And to prove that we were right in 
our thinking that SAC is a predominant military

05:09.101 --> 05:31.847
power in our arsenal is that the Joint Targeting 
Committee is headquartered at the SAC

05:09.101 --> 05:31.847
headquarters, the Navy and the Air Force, under 
the Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Air

05:09.101 --> 05:31.847
Command. So he is the top man. There's no doubt 
about it. But going back to some of these things

05:39.571 --> 05:49.585
we've talked about, I think it is professional 
jealousy, but it can be expected. But it's, I don't

05:49.625 --> 05:54.452
want to say unfounded. SAC should be recognized. 
It should be glamorized. It should have gotten the

05:57.676 --> 05:58.918
money. It should have been built up. Thank God 
we've got it in the position it is right now. Thank

06:05.648 --> 06:06.289
God. But why do you say it should have had all of 
these things? Well, it was fighting for the

06:10.015 --> 06:12.279
dollars. But I mean, why do you think it should have 
been glamorized? Well, you call it glamorized,

06:15.625 --> 06:19.511
are we using the proper word? Maybe just say 
Department of Defense propaganda to

06:19.551 --> 06:27.283
indoctrinate the people of this country to accept 
it. To indoctrinate the... voters that the number

06:28.527 --> 06:33.434
one power tell your congressman to give money to 
SAC, the Air Force. You don't buy another carrier.

06:37.701 --> 06:38.422
This is done.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.348
And I was all for that. You thought that the Air 
Force in general should, during the 1950s, should

06:44.571 --> 06:55.648
have received more money than the Army or the Navy?

06:59.105 --> 07:09.640
Matter of fact, because of the priority of the 
importance of the, if you will, we're beginning to

06:59.105 --> 07:09.640
think now in terms of deterrence. A rhetorical 
question. What do you think turned Khrushchev's

07:11.282 --> 07:16.991
ships around with taking missiles to Cuba?

07:20.396 --> 07:25.202
It was the Strategic Air Command nuclear call. 
Well, what about the... Navy admiral that would

07:27.370 --> 07:31.214
respond. It was the fact that we had eight aircraft 
carriers

07:31.234 --> 07:44.990
off the coast of Cuba blocking the way of those 
freighters. Well, sure. As a matter of fact, I was

07:46.932 --> 07:52.178
part of, where was I when that happened? How would 
you answer that question? Well, it was natural for

07:55.636 --> 07:57.638
the Admiral to say that. Oh, okay. But why didn't 
that Admiral do anything? He wasn't supposed to do

08:04.605 --> 08:08.568
anything until he got directions from the 
President of the United States. The President of

08:08.969 --> 08:24.664
the United States, probably in his frantic 
telephone conversation with Khrushchev, and I

08:08.969 --> 08:24.664
don't know, I can't confirm this because I've 
heard it secondhand, but I understand it was a red

08:08.969 --> 08:24.664
telephone hotline between Khrushchev and 
Kennedy. that things got really frantic and hot.

08:29.723 --> 08:36.530
And I can imagine the things that Kenny would be 
saying. Well, sure, we've got carriers out there,

08:38.071 --> 08:45.899
but I've got my nuclear fleet ready here to take 
off. Now, you turn those missiles on. Well, they

08:48.922 --> 08:51.564
were in here at the time, weren't they? Some of them 
probably were. I know that tactically we had a huge

08:54.547 --> 09:09.062
tactical air force for all practical purposes 
assembled and deployed in the southern reaches of

08:54.547 --> 09:09.062
Florida, besides all those carriers down in the 
Navy and Sea. We were prepared. That was a proof of

09:10.203 --> 09:11.384
stage. Okay, now let's go back and talk about, 
change the topic for a minute to your career.

09:20.074 --> 09:23.457
You've been a full colonel now for about 13 years. 
Sure

09:25.073 --> 09:28.597
were. You were a full colonel from 44 to 57. That's 
right.

09:35.845 --> 09:41.191
Well, were you starting to wonder if you were ever 
going to be promoted again? Oh, yeah. I was a

09:41.732 --> 09:43.554
normal, typical colonel. It entered into my mind, 
and there were two or three promotions, two or

09:43.814 --> 09:54.186
three years before I got it, that really I did 
wonder. It's typical, normal. Well, you had been

09:56.695 --> 10:00.979
in now for 18 years in the service.

10:04.182 --> 10:05.563
But you look at those 18 years. How long am I in those 
18 years without a full colonel? That's something

10:09.187 --> 10:11.208
unusual. See, I got in right at the start of the war, 
so I was a full colonel in 1944. You'd been a full

10:17.514 --> 10:22.199
colonel for 13 of the 18 years that you were in the 
service. Right. And so I was wondering if, you

10:22.887 --> 10:27.373
know, they passed you over so many times. I don't 
think I was ever passed over. I look at it that way. I

10:31.738 --> 10:35.643
just wasn't to be chosen yet. That's the way I look 
at it. Oh, is there any possibility of jeopardy

10:37.465 --> 10:46.376
that they might order you into retirement unless 
you made Brigadier General? I never, no, I never.

10:48.659 --> 10:50.562
That never in my mind, my career. What? Legally, 
could it have happened? No, no. Okay. There's just

10:55.582 --> 10:57.164
so many spots open. Yeah, I'm not... I'm just 
wondering about this. You're asking questions

11:01.470 --> 11:03.953
I'm answering. Just so you know, there was nothing 
like that. Okay, but were you... Later on, you

11:07.016 --> 11:13.164
know, rules and regulations were set up for 
promotion. In later years, we're actually passed

11:13.184 --> 11:16.308
over a certain number. As a matter of fact, my 
brother was passed over, and that's Before he was

11:21.545 --> 11:25.991
forced out actually by the law, he did retire. 
Well, when were those retirement laws

11:26.251 --> 11:30.377
established? I thought they were established in 
the 50s.

11:38.608 --> 11:39.349
I don't know. Well,

11:39.369 --> 11:46.720
at any rate, that wasn't up to me. And I never 
worried about it. OK. Did you want to become a

11:49.726 --> 11:51.288
general? Oh, certainly. As a matter of fact, I had 
the aspiration to become a four-star general. You

11:57.195 --> 11:57.615
did? I'm sure I was typical. Ambitious?

12:03.082 --> 12:04.543
You considered yourself ambitious. Oh, 
absolutely. Dedicated.

12:11.231 --> 12:16.157
Tell me about when you learned that you were going 
to be promoted to brigadier general. How'd you

12:16.297 --> 12:19.581
find out?

12:24.488 --> 12:25.289
Let me see. How did I find that

12:25.389 --> 12:34.861
out? I think I got a call from

12:35.001 --> 12:45.615
a general someplace on the, well, maybe 
Washington. Probably Washington. Got a call from

12:49.039 --> 12:50.361
him. Just called me at my headquarter there at... 
No, you had to be in Colorado. I said in the airport

12:57.540 --> 12:59.542
today. I was in Colorado. Yeah, you were in 
Colorado. And he called me and said,

13:01.905 --> 13:07.170
congratulations, Charles. Something like that. 
That's the first indication. I knew the list was

13:10.374 --> 13:11.775
coming out. Who was it?

13:17.842 --> 13:21.546
General... Four-star general. Moe Preston, 
M-O-E Preston, P-R-E-S-T-O-N. I'd worked for

13:28.185 --> 13:28.926
him. He was my boss, first boss at Northeast Air 
Command up at Newton. When he called me, I think

13:34.914 --> 13:39.520
when he called me, he was four-star general, yeah. 
And congratulations. Now, I think, Terry, I think

13:40.801 --> 13:43.965
that's the first indication. Then General 
Partridge... met me in a hall, and somehow I knew, I

13:49.488 --> 13:53.494
remember this one. General Partridge met me and 
made this comment to me. I knew I was promoted. He

13:58.821 --> 14:01.185
shook hands and said, congratulations, Charlie. 
He says, you know, now you're general officer, you

14:01.205 --> 14:07.093
ain't going to have any fun anymore. Laughed. And 
then

14:08.535 --> 14:16.627
they began to come from all directions. Was that 
the same day? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What were your

14:19.238 --> 14:22.142
feelings when you found out? Oh, of course I was 
elated. I had anticipated, you know, we, when the

14:24.205 --> 14:40.589
promotion list was getting ready to come out for 
General General's Day, the colonels, boy, they

14:24.205 --> 14:40.589
follow them and they'll snoot and they'll do 
everything, you know, to find out when they're

14:24.205 --> 14:40.589
going to be out, you know, and they listen and do 
everything you can to find out things. But I knew

14:41.611 --> 14:47.980
the announcement was imminent and, you know, I was 
waiting and then, of course, I got this earlier

14:48.533 --> 14:57.223
call from one of the, I think it was the Pentagon, no 
question it was the Pentagon, but at any rate,

14:48.533 --> 14:57.223
someplace on the East Coast, he called me and 
congratulated me. I'm pretty sure that was his

14:57.243 --> 14:59.065
first indication. The first thing I did was went in 
my office and called Doris and told her about it.

15:04.210 --> 15:15.043
And of course it wasn't to be effective until,

15:04.210 --> 15:15.043
when did, well, it wasn't to be effective until 
later on when I was going to move. It was effective

15:15.063 --> 15:18.186
30th of August 1957. Yeah, but the date of the 
promotion was real early. That's right, yeah.

15:23.611 --> 15:24.593
30th of August. And I was to take over command of the 
25th Air Division, but they were going to send me up

15:25.073 --> 15:33.566
there earlier before I could put the star on. Oh, 
the date of rank? Yeah. It was way back earlier,

15:35.969 --> 15:38.773
isn't it? 1st of August, 58? No, wait a minute. 
Maybe that's the range you're talking about. No,

15:43.701 --> 15:44.101
no. That's...

15:50.836 --> 15:56.050
No, the date of rank, the temporary promotion was 
August 30, 1957. That's when you could put your

15:56.070 --> 15:57.754
star on it. Yeah, it's temporary. But I was due to go 
up to, I had Simultaneously with that promotion,

16:06.749 --> 16:19.066
and that's probably one of the reasons I promoted 
it, because they were going to give me a command of

16:06.749 --> 16:19.066
the 25th Air Division up at Tacoma,

16:06.749 --> 16:19.066
Washington. And you had to be a Brigadier General 
commander of the division. So that's part of the

16:25.755 --> 16:28.679
reason I'm sure I was promoted. But I wanted to put 
the star on and arrive as a Brigadier General. So I

16:36.618 --> 16:50.693
asked, and as a matter of fact, I even remember 
talking to, I think it was Ken Berkman about it, my

16:36.618 --> 16:50.693
boss, and he agreed with me, and, well, we just get 
you already delayed, you go up there, get your star

16:36.618 --> 16:50.693
on first, and then you go up there. So that's where 
we did that. Oh, did you? I arrived with my star on.

16:55.318 --> 16:55.939
Great. It's more effective. More effective as far 
as leadership? Yeah. And at reception, you know,

17:02.326 --> 17:06.490
the civilian community, General Bond here, 
whether it was Colonel Bond here, and I don't know

17:07.094 --> 17:12.502
if I was in before, but he made general vision. 
Sure. Now tell me about that command, 25th Air

17:15.306 --> 17:19.072
Division. Well, that was my first command as a 
general officer, and of course it was... Two

17:19.573 --> 17:25.943
years, 57 to 59. Getting used to being a brigadier 
general was almost... Getting used to being a

17:26.544 --> 17:35.397
general officer and

17:38.262 --> 17:45.770
was almost first priority with me from the 
standpoint of my entire responsibility

17:38.262 --> 17:45.770
commanding my Confederate agents. By the way, I 
relieved a general who was commanding . Tell me

17:53.397 --> 17:55.539
about getting used to being a general officer. 
What were the problems?

18:01.465 --> 18:04.108
Well, I don't know whether you call them problems 
or not. It's just acting the part. of a general, and

18:08.806 --> 18:21.999
I guess acting as part of what you consider to be the 
ideal type of a general.

18:22.019 --> 18:32.368
In other words, I guess all of us had in mind what a 
real general was and how you would act and so forth,

18:22.019 --> 18:32.368
and then you sort of modeled yourself after that. 
At least that was my feeling, and I think many

18:32.388 --> 18:37.193
others felt the same way.

18:42.168 --> 18:45.832
And then how did you model yourself? Who was the 
ideal general to you? Did you model yourself?

18:48.775 --> 18:49.536
Well, see, that's it. You think of many generals 
that you knew before and how they acted. Of course,

18:55.102 --> 19:04.532
I did come from Norad where I had a great deal of 
respect for General Cartridge, a very fine man who

18:55.102 --> 19:04.532
conducted himself as a dignified, very fine man. 
Didn't smoke, drank little, was a fine physical

19:05.193 --> 19:10.318
specimen, and a would still fly an airplane. And 
then I remember an old gentleman,

19:13.085 --> 19:31.543
a hard man, hard but fair, demanded competence, 
excellent performance, that type of thing, but

19:13.085 --> 19:31.543
treated people fair. Just hard but fair. I guess 
that's sort of my feeling, being hard but fair. In

19:38.935 --> 19:41.659
other words, you have more accepted the LeMay? You 
more modeled yourself after LeMay than after

19:41.679 --> 19:45.344
Partridge? No, I won't say that. I guess a 
combination of Chenault, LeMay, Partridge,

19:47.467 --> 20:05.972
Charlie Myers, a terrific man whom I worked under, 
a Northeasterly man who was went by, people knew

20:07.808 --> 20:11.312
him as Uncle Charlie. Kind, gentle, fine old man. 
Terrific.

20:17.498 --> 20:18.039
You name it. The qualities, all the qualities that 
you would, you can think of, you know, I thought of

20:18.059 --> 20:24.766
them as various generals. And even after all that, 
I guess I settled down to just being old Charlie

20:26.508 --> 20:31.993
Bond after all, after a while. Doing what I thought 
was right, handing people and making decisions.

20:40.192 --> 20:44.156
I had a very fine, tactically oriented command. I 
had one of the best air defense divisions in the

20:44.276 --> 20:51.502
entire United States. Did you ever want to talk 
about that? Did you find it difficult to assume the

20:53.384 --> 20:57.268
role as a general? No. No. I was prepared for it. 
Okay, tell me about your division. How large was

21:04.234 --> 21:04.975
it? What was the mission?

21:11.242 --> 21:13.525
The mission included...

21:17.010 --> 21:20.656
I believe when I took over this command, it was 
still CONAD. We hadn't actually officially

21:20.836 --> 21:29.168
announced the NORAD organization, which would 
have included part of Canada later on. When I first

21:29.188 --> 21:32.553
took it over, I included... I take it back. It was 
NORAD, yeah. My command included a line on the map.

21:39.703 --> 21:40.945
It went up... north of Vancouver, matter of fact, 
probably 30 or 40 miles, maybe 50, 60 miles north of

21:41.566 --> 22:10.358
the Canadian border to include two or three radar 
sites, and then east-west from the ocean,

21:41.566 --> 22:10.358
extending out the ocean, you know, to include 
early warning naval ships, then over to include

21:41.566 --> 22:10.358
part of Montana, then down south, including 
Idaho, then across, including the northern part

21:41.566 --> 22:10.358
of Oregon, then out to sea again. So it was really 
the northwestern sector of the United States, and

22:13.344 --> 22:39.940
it was, if you go right straight down south of me for 
the western part of the United States, I had my

22:13.344 --> 22:39.940
division for the northwest, the 28th division for 
the central part of the west coast, San Francisco

22:13.344 --> 22:39.940
primarily, then the 27th division for the 
southern part of the United States, in the west,

22:13.344 --> 22:39.940
primarily Los Angeles. for geography-wise, 
that's about the way it was lined up. And I wore two

22:46.671 --> 22:48.895
or three hats, if you will. I was a combined 
commander, General Charles Bond, commander of

22:49.155 --> 22:59.470
the 25th NORAD Division, which included Canada. I 
had a fighter squadron and two or three radars

22:59.490 --> 23:04.457
there. I had one. I owned the base, the big base at 
McCord. the little base north there called Payne

23:12.742 --> 23:19.588
Air Force Base up towards the northern border of 
the United States towards Canada. I was a tenant on

23:20.909 --> 23:30.618
a SAC B-52 base over in western Washington at 
Larson Air Force Base. I had National Guard units

23:30.638 --> 23:35.402
at Geiger Air Force Base under me, fighter units. I 
had, oh, I'd say at least five or six radar sites six

23:41.598 --> 23:50.231
or seven right now, throughout Washington, the 
state of Washington, and Oregon under me. Montana

23:52.214 --> 23:53.856
and Idaho.

23:59.565 --> 24:01.668
I'd say... You said you wore two or three hats. What 
was your other one? My second hat was a Joint

24:04.392 --> 24:06.475
Commander. Army and Navy. I had, by the way, I had 
operational control of the Canadian Forces. I had

24:12.576 --> 24:14.219
operational control. I didn't command them, but I 
had operational control over them. I was

24:20.028 --> 24:31.687
commander of the, joint commander of the 25th 
Con-Ad Division, which included the United

24:20.028 --> 24:31.687
States Army and the United States Air Force units. 
I had Nike ground-to-air missiles,

24:34.889 --> 24:41.915
ground-to-air missiles, surface-to-air 
missiles under me. And at that time, Ajax later on

24:43.236 --> 24:49.802
became Nike nuclear chips. And then I wore a third 
hat as the Air Force commander of the 25th Air

24:49.902 --> 24:59.451
Division, ADC, which is just the Air Force units 
and radar sites. And I had operational control

24:59.471 --> 25:03.394
over a Navy

25:08.335 --> 25:20.090
early warning radar ship destroyer type out to the 
sea off of the coast of northern Oregon and

25:08.335 --> 25:20.090
Washington. Then I also had operational control 
over what we called an AEW, Airborne Early Warning

25:20.110 --> 25:33.988
and Control Air Force aircraft. out of air defense 
command with radar flying back and forth in the

25:34.458 --> 25:47.479
area for air-to-air, well, air coverage, 
extending our radar coverage to the seaboard. So I

25:47.499 --> 25:51.486
had quite a big organization, and I can't remember 
exactly. I'd say it had to be 15,000, 20,000

25:51.506 --> 25:58.056
people. This is a tremendous leap in 
responsibility for us. How'd you like all the

26:01.795 --> 26:10.207
additional

26:01.795 --> 26:10.207
responsibility? Well, it's a challenge. I liked 
it. I had to work. I accepted it. And my wife

26:25.201 --> 26:30.446
detected the true dedication and the work and my 
position. You know, it involved her and I found it

26:30.466 --> 26:40.355
disgusting, the higher responsibility we had in 
the Air Force and my military career. We talked

26:41.256 --> 26:46.040
about it many times.

26:46.060 --> 26:54.448
And of course, I was the number one Air Force man in 
that area, ranking Air Force man, so I had the

26:46.060 --> 26:54.448
leading responsibility in relation to the 
civilians in the community. Yeah, tell me about

26:58.381 --> 26:59.422
that. Did you have any problems with the 
civilians? No. As a matter of fact, I've never had

27:02.026 --> 27:06.832
any problems with any civilians in the community. 
It's something you have to contend with, though,

27:06.852 --> 27:10.296
and you have to recognize. I had some heated 
arguments with a congresswoman from the state of

27:10.997 --> 27:23.693
Oregon one time, Edith Green, about an air 
defense, my air defense unit at the airport at

27:10.997 --> 27:23.693
Portland, Oregon. She was trying to get us out of 
there. Why? She just didn't want us in there. It

27:29.204 --> 27:52.887
involved too much of a problem for the city and also 
messed up the,

27:29.204 --> 27:52.887
supposedly took occupied,

27:29.204 --> 27:52.887
widely needed facilities for the commercial 
airlines and other political reasons. I guess at

27:53.204 --> 27:57.211
the closest I came, really, to locking horns with a 
politician. But I kept my temper, and I'm glad I

27:58.013 --> 28:01.519
did. But if I ever did dislike the congressman, the 
congresswoman, the senator, that was the one. You

28:12.480 --> 28:13.782
thought she was unreasonable? I thought she was 
wrong. Of course, she had her political reasons,

28:18.736 --> 28:31.010
and I understand the power of politics, but I had my 
military responsibilities.

28:31.030 --> 28:41.581
You remained in that job for about two years, and 
then you shifted to the 28th Air Division in

28:31.030 --> 28:41.581
California, Hamilton Air Force Base. Why'd they 
shift you?

28:45.786 --> 28:46.887
I'd been up there for couple of years, and after 
you've been in the command for a while, you know,

28:47.153 --> 28:51.760
maybe look forward to going to another one. But I 
loved California, and Hamilton Air Force Base was

28:51.780 --> 29:00.652
the most choice air base in the entire United 
States. Why? One of the most beautiful,

29:00.792 --> 29:08.924
convenient, to that lovely city of San Francisco. 
Climate-wise, it was better than that rainy area

29:08.944 --> 29:16.755
of Northwest United States and Washington, but 
beautiful. and also I was very close to General

29:17.258 --> 29:42.321
Parker who was then the commander of Western Air 
Defense Force who commanded the three divisions

29:17.258 --> 29:42.321
from the north to the south and he and I were very 
close mutually respected each other and that job

29:17.258 --> 29:42.321
came open and we liked each other and He knew I loved 
Hamilton. I'd done a good job, and I'd been up in

29:45.360 --> 29:54.048
Washington for two years, and the way things go, he 
gave me the job. Well, either at Hamilton or on my

29:54.488 --> 30:00.434
board in Washington, were there any major 
problems that you had to overcome? No.

30:01.996 --> 30:04.899
Essentially, this was the same type of job, 
exactly. It was a similar type of an air division,

30:04.979 --> 30:10.384
but in a different location.

30:11.208 --> 30:17.919
You felt a little bit greater responsibility for 
protecting, let's say, a huge area like San

30:11.208 --> 30:17.919
Francisco versus, let's say, Seattle. But on the 
other hand, Seattle had terrific aircraft

30:17.939 --> 30:21.465
industry. And SAC bases in it. Of course, now I had 
SAC bases protecting the 28th Division area. So

30:26.954 --> 30:30.720
really, it's essentially exactly the same job. I 
was living closer to my boss, my headquarter, as a

30:30.740 --> 30:34.507
matter of fact, on the same airbag. He would come 
over and see me and give me

30:51.050 --> 30:52.191
of proper management. Same job. As a matter of 
fact, I felt much more secure because of the

30:54.614 --> 31:03.182
experience of wearing my star for a few years in the 
Command and Air Division. I took over the 28th

31:03.202 --> 31:06.906
without a problem. As a matter of fact, it was a 
little bit smaller in size and units and radar

31:06.926 --> 31:17.076
sites in the 25th Air Division. And I didn't have 
the Canadians under me then.

31:23.922 --> 31:28.389
How did you get along with the Canadians when you 
were in Washington? Fine. Typical great people.

31:33.476 --> 31:38.483
Well, were you sorry to leave Hamilton in October 
1960 when you went to Italy for three years? No, I

31:38.764 --> 31:45.253
figured I was due for an overseas assignment.

31:46.195 --> 31:49.980
Here again, when I came up, I had a chance to take my 
family. And here again, see, it was a NATO job. It

31:55.028 --> 31:56.089
was combined. It was shape. Shape. And here I see I 
was in a combined command. I was wearing a NORAD

32:01.054 --> 32:02.316
hat. I'd been operating with Canadian forces, 
another nation. I'd had experience a long, long

32:07.461 --> 32:09.163
time. But now you were the deputy commander. Yep. 
And the commander was what, a two-star general?

32:16.690 --> 32:20.254
No, a general.

32:21.331 --> 32:26.158
Bianchi was a lieutenant general, three-star 
general in the Italian Air Force. But he was

32:26.178 --> 32:41.422
commanding the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force of 
the

32:26.178 --> 32:41.422
southern area of shape. What did we call it? Yeah, 
north, central, and south. South Forces, what

32:44.888 --> 32:53.778
economy is referred to them as South Forces of 
NATO, which included the Army, Navy, and Air

32:44.888 --> 32:53.778
Forces. Greeks, Turks, Italian, American, 
British, you name it, NATO. In a sense, you lost

33:00.546 --> 33:05.311
your own command to a new job. Did you resent losing 
time? I figured this was definitely a step up,

33:07.974 --> 33:11.198
because this was NATO. Sure. This was a... Allied 
Tactical Air Force. I was going to an Air Force

33:17.801 --> 33:22.907
level from a division level, so I was going on. And I 
never dreamed of the problems I would have when I

33:23.167 --> 33:31.177
took over this job. It was a, the move was a 
fantastic journey. We traveled by ship with my

33:37.424 --> 33:44.072
family on a first class USS Independence. First, 
look at TB Love Boat today and see that ship. Well,

33:48.371 --> 33:49.753
that's the type of ship we were on. Had my whole 
family with me and shipped my car and all. Treated

33:53.638 --> 33:54.520
royally. SS in the family. It wasn't an United 
States ship. Well, SS, yeah. And commercial ship.

34:03.993 --> 34:06.516
Big luxury liner. On the way we stopped at 
Casablanca and got ashore. That's the first state

34:12.219 --> 34:17.345
my wife had any foreign country and was aghast at 
it. And then we stopped for a second at Gibraltar,

34:17.806 --> 34:31.384
then on to Majorca, and then to Naples, and then to 
basically Dr. Genova. We met there by accident.

34:33.547 --> 34:44.117
some of the staff that I was taking over, and then we 
drove across in a car to Vicenza, Italy, where I was

34:33.547 --> 34:44.117
there for the next three years. Very interesting 
assignment. Charlie? Yep. Do you want to change

34:46.820 --> 34:48.422
the water? Oh, yeah.

34:52.245 --> 34:59.132
You mentioned problems and all kinds of problems 
in Italy with NATO. What were they? That I hadn't

35:00.347 --> 35:01.509
anticipated. And you had not anticipated? What 
were these problems? Well, upon arriving at

35:04.653 --> 35:29.389
Vicenza, a little town about 30 minutes driving 
west from Venice, in the northern area of Italy,

35:04.653 --> 35:29.389
just at the foothills of the Alps, just an ideal 
place, geographical-wise, in Europe, to be

35:04.653 --> 35:29.389
assigned with my family, naturally. was the 
happiest man in the world. I hadn't been there 24

35:31.657 --> 35:44.615
hours when I met the man I was replacing, and he 
briefed me on his boss, who was to be my boss,

35:31.657 --> 35:44.615
Lieutenant General Bianchi. That is wrong. 
B-I-A-N-C-H-I. If there ever was a Hitler

35:47.719 --> 35:53.347
fascist, this man was. No kidding. The general I 
relieved, a brigadier general, United States Air

35:55.109 --> 35:59.055
Force, That's one reason he was being reassigned, 
and the spot had to be filled, and it was a NATO

35:59.407 --> 36:06.577
assignment. He wouldn't speak to General 
Bianchi. He would not even go into his office. They

36:13.086 --> 36:14.588
hated each other so much. Really? And he briefed me 
on the type of man this gentleman was, and I didn't

36:15.490 --> 36:20.737
know this. Nobody ever told me. And I was shocked. 
They must have known this back at the Pentagon. I'm

36:28.357 --> 36:29.097
sure they did. Why they assigned you? Because 
you'd had so many international contacts? And had

36:34.302 --> 36:40.048
been on combined staff, worked with other 
nationals. So here was another national, a

36:40.068 --> 36:46.875
commander that I was the vice commander on. And of 
course, I learned as time went on that no wonder.

36:52.006 --> 36:54.329
guy wouldn't speak to him, and I don't blame him. 
Had I been a different person, I guess I wouldn't

36:54.349 --> 36:59.355
have spoken with the man. But he hated, there's no 
doubt this man in his heart had to hate Americans

37:01.238 --> 37:12.732
from the standpoint of the typical jealous 
battalion, hating an American. but it stemmed

37:12.914 --> 37:16.218
from his background as a fascist, I'm sure. He was 
the tactical air commander in support of General

37:16.559 --> 37:25.331
Rommel for the African campaign against the 
American and British forces. That's how high a

37:25.351 --> 37:26.833
position he was. How the heck did he ever get a 
position in charge of NATO? Well, actually, in

37:31.159 --> 37:39.990
this position, though, and on through the end of 
the war, you think, why shouldn't he be chief of

37:31.159 --> 37:39.990
staff of the Italian Air Force? And, you know, way 
high up, But he wasn't, and he was only lieutenant

37:41.332 --> 37:43.475
colonel. But it's obvious his personality and 
just

37:43.495 --> 37:59.417
a nasty, nasty, arrogant, fierce, savage man, his 
personality. Not physically, but nasty in his

37:59.437 --> 38:02.060
talk. He could speak perfect English, but proud of 
it. A typical arrogant, strutting, ill-duty

38:06.046 --> 38:09.010
type. I hated his guts. Put that in there. That's 
awfully strong. And

38:16.571 --> 38:25.602
subsequently, of course, I found out that he was 
known all over NATO as a respected person. And your

38:25.622 --> 38:29.246
old Charlie Bond was his vice commander. How did he 
get the job of being in charge of the southern

38:30.188 --> 38:38.878
section of NATO with that personality? He had had 
previous jobs in NATO headquarters, but it's

38:39.365 --> 38:46.172
obviously because of his personality he couldn't 
get along. They didn't want him. But he was a very

38:47.593 --> 38:50.957
capable tactical commander. There's no doubt 
there wasn't another general in the Italian Air

38:51.297 --> 39:01.147
Force that could even touch him in tactical 
experience and know-how. They couldn't. There

39:01.707 --> 39:05.271
was none that I knew of or met that could even touch 
him. He was, no doubt, because of his experience

39:06.112 --> 39:09.437
and background. He had been in the Civil War in 
Spain, on the side of the Pacific. At times he'd get

39:16.767 --> 39:22.896
off on the Il Duce, and no doubt he still respected 
the Il Duce. What did he say about it? He just

39:24.919 --> 39:25.760
respected him. Nothing direct about, I love the 
man, nothing like that, but his conversation

39:28.564 --> 39:35.494
always about the Il Duce was, you know, it was 
obvious that... He's a fascist. How could you

39:38.909 --> 39:40.371
tell? He was a typical, anything you've ever read 
about the arrogant, fascist type of person, this

39:40.411 --> 39:50.283
is the way he acted. You've seen movies of him. 
You've seen movies of Ducey, El Ducey. This is the

39:54.669 --> 39:56.751
way he acted. This was his personality. He would, 
in inspecting troops walking down a line, he'd

39:58.854 --> 40:03.760
actually strut like maybe the way a movie star 
would strut, you know, over, just emoting. You can

40:11.535 --> 40:15.139
tell the way I'm talking how I felt about the man.

40:18.523 --> 40:26.030
My first reception by him was, had I not been told 
about the man, I would have never suspected it the

40:18.523 --> 40:26.030
first time I met him. I was received in his office 
with open arms, very polite, very condescending,

40:34.958 --> 40:41.046
And looking back now, getting ready to shove the 
knife up my rear end and down my back. Literally

40:42.327 --> 40:45.491
hated Americans.

40:46.673 --> 41:00.711
My boss down the line, American Air Force, United 
States Air Force's wife, Lieutenant General

40:46.673 --> 41:00.711
Swafford, who was Commander Air South, actually 
was commander of him, see, in the NATO command.

41:01.452 --> 41:02.653
Commander Air South was the Air Force component of 
AFSAL, which was the southern region of Europe of

41:03.528 --> 41:21.945
the NATO command, vis-a-vis AFSANT, Armed Forces 
Central Europe, and AFNORTH, Armed Forces

41:03.528 --> 41:21.945
Northern Europe. That was NATO, in effect. Then, 
of course, you had some other commands. But

41:25.648 --> 41:27.530
essentially, that was Europe. I was vice 
commander of the 5th Allied Tactical Air Force

41:33.346 --> 42:02.965
under air air force's south general swafford who 
was always an uh american general that's the way

41:33.346 --> 42:02.965
the village were assigned the commander of the 
fifth a-tap was essentially the italian air force

41:33.346 --> 42:02.965
italy so naturally it was italian general the 
commander of the sixth a-tap uh the other air force

41:33.346 --> 42:02.965
of the uh air south was in izmir turkey and uh was 
commanded by a edict, an agreement, by an American

42:03.113 --> 42:10.705
general, American Air Force general. That was a 
lineup. And it consisted of the Greek and Turkish

42:11.526 --> 42:14.791
Air Forces.

42:16.995 --> 42:19.679
Fifth ATF and Sixth ATF. Immediately to our north 
in Central Forces was the Fourth ATF, which was

42:19.940 --> 42:28.513
also commanded by an American Air Force general. 
But that's the way the setup was. Were most of your

42:32.502 --> 42:36.545
problems on this job caused by Bianchi? Oh, 
absolutely. I didn't have any problem whatsoever

42:38.127 --> 42:40.469
in Italy. As far as the job itself was concerned, 
were there any problems, or were they all this man?

42:46.394 --> 42:51.439
Oh, there were some problems in cooperation with 
the Italian Army. I think probably caused by the

42:53.120 --> 42:57.724
feelings of the United States Army component, 
which was really a surface-to-surface missile

42:58.480 --> 43:19.802
unit at Pachinza, a nuclear-tipped outfit, and 
working with an Italian counterpart of the same

42:58.480 --> 43:19.802
type of an outfit, where really they could help 
instruct them and train them and so forth. And they

43:19.822 --> 43:24.066
were the members of the Army forces. of AFSAL, 
Armed Forces of the South. And the Army General of

43:28.934 --> 43:49.715
the Italian Army and General Bianchi, the Air 
Force commander, they had jealousy, very

43:28.934 --> 43:49.715
obvious, much more so than those of, let's say, the 
Army and the Air Force, the United States forces,

43:28.934 --> 43:49.715
let's say, back in the United States. We didn't 
know what professional jealousy was. You see that

43:51.978 --> 43:54.120
over there. But that was their problem, really, 
sir. It wasn't my problem. Administrative-wise,

43:58.431 --> 44:17.673
see, General Bianchi, administration-wise, he 
had nothing to do with me and about 10

43:58.431 --> 44:17.673
or 15, maybe 12, 15 or 20 officers and airmen of the 
United States Air Forces was also assigned to this

43:58.431 --> 44:17.673
headquarters and part of his staff. Essentially, 
The 5th Allied Tactical Air Force was an American

44:20.881 --> 44:26.327
staffed outfit to do the work for NATO. But it was an 
Italian Air Force General that commanded the 5th

44:26.347 --> 44:30.252
General. And the Chief of Staff was an Italian Air 
Force Brigadier General. But the Vice Commander,

44:36.659 --> 44:40.743
number two, was an American General Meade. At that 
time, a Brigadier General. And the slot had always

44:45.068 --> 44:47.331
been a Brigadier General. That's what it called 
for in the organization. Give me some examples of

44:51.205 --> 44:54.229
some of the problems you had with this man. He

44:54.890 --> 45:19.947
didn't like

44:54.890 --> 45:19.947
for my driver to come up in front of the 
headquarters building and let me out. which was

45:21.850 --> 45:26.835
facing the ramp of the little airport we had. He 
didn't like for my driver, for instance, to bring

45:27.555 --> 45:36.364
me up in the morning and let me get out of my car the 
same way his driver brought him up and let him get

45:27.555 --> 45:36.364
out of the car. I didn't know this irritated him for 
about a month. And finally, he just called me in and

45:39.006 --> 45:49.596
told me that he would prefer that I come up in the 
back of the building.

45:50.082 --> 45:53.446
This was really the first time that he directed me 
to do something. It was really a matter of

45:53.526 --> 45:58.252
administration, however it pertained to 
discipline, command, and control. So I didn't

45:58.272 --> 46:01.696
argue with him. And I said, all right. You said, all 
right. Oh, yeah. I didn't argue with him. I said,

46:05.921 --> 46:07.743
OK. OK. But it irritated me. And I turned around and 
walked out of there. I didn't follow this

46:13.971 --> 46:16.474
instruction. Oh, you didn't? No. I got to think 
about it, and I thought, I'm not going to do this.

46:23.302 --> 46:26.185
I'm a deputy commander of this company. And I can 
see now what my forerunner, I forget his name,

46:26.205 --> 46:34.653
general somebody, I can see what he means now. So I 
might as well take the bit in my mouth right at the

46:34.673 --> 46:38.196
outset here. But pretty soon I won't be speaking to 
this guy. So the next day I came up to Barclay

46:41.059 --> 46:46.444
Fronikin and got out of the car. This went on for 
about a week and he'd seen me. Probably one day an

46:50.757 --> 47:00.492
airman comes in,

46:50.757 --> 47:00.492
Comandante Vaughn, General Bianchi would like to 
see you. A very polite aide. So I walked in and I

47:04.539 --> 47:05.500
walked
