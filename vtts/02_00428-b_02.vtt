WEBVTT

00:08.890 --> 00:15.497
So you had done so well in Venezuela, and that's why 
you think that they chose you for that job, because

00:08.890 --> 00:15.497
you would oversee this duty. Yes. That probably 
came out on my record. In

00:18.159 --> 00:25.967
fact, the Venezuela Army had asked for me to return 
to Venezuela. Really? Yeah.

00:30.211 --> 00:31.152
But the Army wouldn't? No. And I didn't feel at that 
time I should go back. But it never really was

00:36.898 --> 00:38.880
seriously considered. Now what were your first 
impressions when you arrived in Yugoslavia in

00:39.518 --> 00:44.404
June 1959? Well of course I went with my family and 
my first impression was, on the first day, was by

00:44.945 --> 00:56.579
golly I can't use this language because I had to.

00:59.402 --> 01:08.513
And we went in of course through Trieste, 
Ljubljana, and Zagreb to Belgrade. To tell you the

01:09.218 --> 01:19.870
truth, it was very obvious you're in another 
country when you leave Italy. Oh, yeah. Very

01:20.711 --> 01:21.332
obvious. It's just like you can go out here and look 
at a piece of land and look across the fence and it's

01:22.313 --> 01:34.247
obvious that's somebody else's across the fence.

01:36.522 --> 01:38.224
The people weren't dressed as well. The buildings 
were not maintained as well. The roads were not as

01:40.907 --> 01:43.349
good. The facilities just didn't look like that 
they'd been taken care of. There wasn't much new in

01:52.439 --> 01:57.985
general in terms of structures.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.753
It just was a little bit depressing, to tell you the 
truth. What were your functions? You said that

02:09.296 --> 02:12.141
basically you were on your own. What did you do with 
your time? Basically on your own. Oh, we were busy.

02:16.669 --> 02:23.401
Again, my primary function was intelligence.

02:24.163 --> 02:25.765
How many did you have in your stay out? I had two 
officers and two enlisted men and a civilian. And

02:30.474 --> 02:31.656
were you housed in the embassy? No, we had quarters 
designated by the Yugoslav Army for the U.S.

02:31.923 --> 02:47.007
Attaché, and very adequate, by the way, a big old 
villa on about two acres of land, probably. Just

02:47.808 --> 02:50.572
before we left, they took much of that land away. 
And your family could see it? It was really pretty

02:53.056 --> 02:54.439
extravagant. Oh, yes. And that's where my family 
and I lived. And we were We had a staff of servants

03:01.049 --> 03:17.046
because, well, to get into the functions, first of 
all, you've got to have servants if you fulfill

03:01.049 --> 03:17.046
this function, this job, by the way, because the 
wife is just as committed, really, basically, as

03:01.049 --> 03:17.046
you are. And she, by the way, looked at just as 
carefully, if not more so, than the officer when

03:19.769 --> 03:28.778
this selection is made to send you on attache duty. 
And the reason I say she's looked at more carefully

03:29.551 --> 03:37.900
is because there's a record on me, but there's not a 
record on her in the files.

03:40.683 --> 03:49.733
Secondly, after the intelligence function, and 
it can be put first if your ambassador wants it to

03:40.683 --> 03:49.733
be, you're an advisor to the ambassador. You're a 
member of his staff. You head his army section.

03:56.360 --> 03:56.841
Thirdly, you are a diplomatic representative to 
the Yugoslav Army. I'm getting my countries mixed

04:03.812 --> 04:06.094
up here. In other words, I think in my two years 
there, I had one formal message to deliver to the

04:06.735 --> 04:15.224
Army of Venezuela. You mean Yugoslavia? I mean 
Yugoslavia. What was that?

04:22.591 --> 04:27.216
You know, I don't even remember what the subject 
was, but I know at the time it was a ticklish

04:22.591 --> 04:27.216
subject. thing wasn't great significance, but it 
was sensitive. And so I delivered that formally

04:34.191 --> 04:38.758
from our chief of staff to their chief of staff. The 
rest of the time it was all verbal, but I

04:38.778 --> 04:55.542
represented my army, their army, not only from 
office to office and message to message, but also

04:38.778 --> 04:55.542
socially, of course. I was also part of the

05:01.334 --> 05:15.214
as a member of the diplomatic community, you get 
into this whole diplomatic social scheme of

05:01.334 --> 05:15.214
things, and it sometimes is very, very 
overbearing. So how did we do this job? Because the

05:21.664 --> 05:24.388
United States and Yugoslav governments were on 
good terms. Tito, of course, was the dictator

05:28.069 --> 05:31.133
president. This was in 1959 that I joined, which is 
about 10 years after Tito broke from the Russians.

05:46.055 --> 05:54.628
It was about two years after our military training 
mission, MAG, Military Assistance Group, left.

05:55.351 --> 06:00.636
And I had, by the way, the residual functions of 
that military assistance group, which didn't

05:55.351 --> 06:00.636
amount to a great deal. And Yugoslavia had to 
struggle to survive that break with the Russians.

06:11.888 --> 06:18.835
And our assistance to them was very important, the 
economic assistance as important as the military

06:11.888 --> 06:18.835
assistance. What the military assistance did was 
give them credibility of military capability so

06:25.068 --> 06:28.571
that the Russians didn't intervene. And as 
history shows us now, they probably wish they had

06:29.372 --> 06:38.619
at the time, because the next one that cropped up 
was neighbor Hungary, and they took them just like

06:29.372 --> 06:38.619
that.

06:41.682 --> 06:54.653
At the time that

06:41.682 --> 06:54.653
Yugoslavia broke from the Russian common form,

06:41.682 --> 06:54.653
it was estimated that three-fourths of their 
trade was with the Russian communist bloc, and 25%

06:54.869 --> 07:01.719
with the rest of the world. Well, when they broke, 
this had to be reversed. They continued to trade

07:04.984 --> 07:15.278
some with their neighbors in the communist world, 
but they were basically cut off from trade with the

07:04.984 --> 07:15.278
organized communist group. And so this was a great 
struggle for them, and this led, in my opinion, to

07:16.540 --> 07:23.290
the perception later that Yugoslav communism is 
different. Yugoslav communism is not so bad. And

07:34.509 --> 07:51.808
the reason I say that I think that's what led to this 
misimpression here and in other parts of the world

07:34.509 --> 07:51.808
is that they had to adapt their matter of means of 
conducting commerce to the way we do it. Sure. And

07:56.006 --> 08:04.194
this even became influenced within the country, 
not just at their ports, in a way. And this did make

08:06.916 --> 08:14.143
some difference in the economic picture within 
Yugoslavia. And of course, once this switch was

08:14.163 --> 08:19.308
made, they became more prosperous, I would say. 
Because at the time we left Yugoslavia, we could

08:20.369 --> 08:23.972
see more consumer goods available to the Yugoslav 
people by far than we saw when we traveled in

08:24.290 --> 08:35.143
Bulgaria and Romania, for example. And those are 
the only other two common exceptions. Who was the

08:37.286 --> 08:40.029
ambassador, the American ambassador? The 
ambassador, when I went to Yugoslavia, was

08:40.049 --> 08:47.698
Ambassador Karl Rankin, and he was succeeded by 
Ambassador George Kennan, who's a very famous

08:49.062 --> 08:53.206
person. Oh, yeah, he is. I know George Kennan. I 
admired them both a great deal. Ambassador Rankin

09:00.552 --> 09:03.955
had come there from Formosa. He'd been ambassador 
to Nationalist China for years.

09:10.021 --> 09:14.145
He was, of course, a career diplomat. And Kennan 
succeeded him just a matter of months before I

09:14.165 --> 09:17.888
left. And we had some very interesting

09:18.931 --> 09:25.961
experiences with both of them. What were your 
impressions of these two men? My impressions were

09:29.546 --> 09:45.808
that they were real professionals and highly 
experienced, and we were fortunate to have them.

09:45.828 --> 09:48.111
Ambassador Rankin was one of the calmest. We 
didn't have any great uproars in our relations

09:49.627 --> 09:57.756
when we were there. He was real steady and very much 
respected by the Yugoslav. Wonderful

10:04.544 --> 10:10.350
personality, a very kind man, pleasant to be 
around, pleasant to be with. I hunted with him a

10:10.470 --> 10:11.792
great deal. He loved to hunt, particularly big 
game, and when he learned that I loved to hunt, I

10:20.761 --> 10:22.323
arranged several hunts for him. And we never had 
more than four in the party. You arranged these

10:25.946 --> 10:28.689
hunts with the Yugoslav authorities? Through the 
Yugoslav authorities. And they had, by the way,

10:30.911 --> 10:44.725
some of the finest hunting in the world there for 
particularly the

10:30.911 --> 10:44.725
stag deer, the red deer, and the roebuck, they call 
them over there. The ambassador was particularly

10:46.527 --> 10:49.049
anxious to get a bear. They had the big brown bear. 
We went bear hunting twice, but neither of us ever

10:50.984 --> 10:54.487
got a bear. Did you ever see one? Yes, we saw them, 
but we didn't see any of the boars. Now, you could

11:00.073 --> 11:10.823
take a female if she didn't have a cub, but I never 
saw a female alone with what young were there, and I

11:00.073 --> 11:10.823
didn't want to shoot one that might have still had a 
dependent cub. When you got up in the mountains and

11:11.344 --> 11:15.948
you were hunting, how did you get along? How were 
the people? How did they receive you up there? Some

11:18.871 --> 11:20.012
of the most interesting experiences I had were on 
these hunts with the people. Let me say a little

11:24.469 --> 11:25.510
bit. We're going to get to Ambassador Kennan 
later? All right, fine.

11:35.319 --> 11:48.312
As a matter of fact, there is a very stringent law in 
Yugoslavia and all the communist countries, and

11:35.319 --> 11:48.312
we have similar laws but not quite so stringent, 
about giving information to foreigners. And the

11:48.494 --> 11:53.942
law is almost so severe in Yugoslavia to say that 
you don't even talk to a military attache. It's not

11:55.645 --> 11:58.449
quite that stringent. Well, you didn't wear your 
uniform out there, did you? No, but I would never

12:00.252 --> 12:04.479
put a person in jeopardy by disguising my 
identity. I would always, when I came into the

12:05.540 --> 12:17.218
company

12:05.540 --> 12:17.218
of Yugoslavs that I thought might, well, I just 
always identified myself. Now, that meant that

12:18.228 --> 12:32.865
the only time that I could really have frank 
conversations

12:18.228 --> 12:32.865
with people, citizens, or even some of the 
military

12:18.228 --> 12:32.865
was when it was one-on-one.

12:35.208 --> 12:40.734
And I never felt comfortable, as spooky as this may 
sound, it's true, unless we were out of doors. In

12:41.896 --> 12:48.083
fact, when I briefed Ambassador Kennan, we went to 
the garden of the embassy and walked and strolled

12:41.896 --> 12:48.083
and talked. You've got to assume that if you're in a 
building you normally, or the person you're

12:48.383 --> 12:58.633
talking to normally habitates, you're going to be 
heard. But anyway, on these hunts, I got to meet

13:00.034 --> 13:05.359
many of the simple people. And you can learn a lot 
from the simple people.

13:10.104 --> 13:14.408
And of course, the Yugoslav people, like most 
people, they're very fine people. They're very

13:15.670 --> 13:24.301
friendly to me and all Americans because nearly 
all of them have got a relative of some kind in

13:15.670 --> 13:24.301
America, and they think this is paradise, and 
they're all rich. Oh, yeah. And they are terribly

13:26.243 --> 13:31.249
poor by and large in Yugoslavia. But on these 
hunts, I largely met a few functionaries, but my

13:31.269 --> 13:40.000
real enjoyment was some of the peasants. And 
they're very solid people. conversation with a

13:44.392 --> 14:10.990
man who was sort of my gun bearer assigned and we 
were alone a lot he was born and raised out there you

13:44.392 --> 14:10.990
see when you go bear hunting now you go as far as you 
can on wheels and you like likely you're going to

13:44.392 --> 14:10.990
have to get on a horse to finish your trip and so 
you're up there with the people who are pretty well

13:44.392 --> 14:10.990
isolated and they feel much more free than the 
citizens down in in the cities and towns that are

14:11.459 --> 14:18.587
dealing with the communist apparatus, 
government apparatus. But when this fellow

14:18.607 --> 14:40.470
described to me that he had what amounted to, I 
think, 10 hectares of land, Yugoslavia, and I'm

14:18.607 --> 14:40.470
digressing, but it ties in here,

14:18.607 --> 14:40.470
found that they had no chance, the communist 
government had no chance to communize farming the

14:18.607 --> 14:40.470
land. And so they didn't even try. But what they did 
do was pass a law of inheritance. And by golly, ours

14:46.318 --> 14:48.661
is getting damn near as bad. The law said that you 
can only inherit 10 hectares or less. Well, all of

14:56.129 --> 15:07.943
these estates are quickly being, you know, these 
old land holdings are quickly being reduced to 10

14:56.129 --> 15:07.943
hectares as inheritance occurs. And when you get 
under 10 hectares, there are very few people who

15:08.733 --> 15:14.020
can make a living on it anymore. But they can exist. 
And this old peasant said that he's happier there

15:15.101 --> 15:34.846
than anybody in Yugoslavia because, he says, I've 
got my land, I've got my cattle, I've got my horse,

15:15.101 --> 15:34.846
I've got my dogs, I've got my family, and I've got 
the shumadija, the forest. His land was on the edge

15:34.866 --> 15:37.710
of this huge forest where we went in to hunt. And he 
says, when I walk in the forest, I feel a free man.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.242
Who owned the forest? The government. Then he 
tells me, I ask him, he grows basically on the land

15:47.584 --> 15:56.335
grain and food.

15:56.355 --> 16:04.885
And he went into detail to tell me what he earned 
from that grain. And it turns out that when it He's

16:07.357 --> 16:11.884
made all of his tax payments, some of which can be 
paid in kind like in grain. He would have about a

16:14.288 --> 16:17.292
third of what he raised. I mean, that's gross. Then 
he has to pay a tax on his land. That's his crop

16:25.505 --> 16:28.269
thing. He has to pay a tax on his cattle. He said, I 
even have to pay a tax on my dog.

16:38.525 --> 16:57.884
And you get a very good picture of how little 
anybody on the land in Yugoslavia can ever realize

16:38.525 --> 16:57.884
and what they've done to gradually gain control of 
the vast part of the agricultural land in

16:38.525 --> 16:57.884
Yugoslavia. Now, that ties right in. You also get 
from these people when you talk to them what the

17:02.028 --> 17:06.372
effect of the police influences and 
effectiveness. And I saw that firsthand because

17:10.195 --> 17:34.452
I had a young bachelor sergeant who naturally made 
acquaintance with Yugoslav girls from time to

17:10.195 --> 17:34.452
time, and almost inevitably, we wouldn't hear 
about all of them, I'm sure, but certainly the

17:10.195 --> 17:34.452
second date he'd have with a girl, When he took her 
home, the police would be there right after he

17:36.423 --> 17:44.451
left, arrest her, and grill her, and sometimes 
mistreat her. Really? Oh, yes. You know, they're

17:48.115 --> 17:56.263
not supposed to talk back, but we'd get it back 
occasionally through the, I mean, I can cite two or

17:48.115 --> 17:56.263
three instances of that. I can cite, that's 
firsthand, you might say firsthand knowledge,

17:58.605 --> 18:03.190
but anyway. I saw enough to know that the police 
system is so efficient. You can talk and fuss about

18:08.506 --> 18:24.810
the price of eggs and the fact that there's not a 
decent bus system in Belgrade or

18:08.506 --> 18:24.810
this, that, and the other, but boy, don't talk 
about the government because somebody hears you.

18:26.512 --> 18:32.080
And if I can continue this digression to get back to 
this peasant, I

18:33.562 --> 18:41.554
had a language school instructor, former 
Yugoslav. He immigrated to this country when he

18:41.594 --> 18:43.577
was a young man. Come to visit Belgrade, and he 
wrote me he was coming. He had a brother who was

18:49.485 --> 18:55.174
married and had a child in Belgrade. I'd never met 
him, of course. And when he came, I offered to His

19:00.916 --> 19:02.558
brother had no transportation. Very few people 
had an automobile. And this friend, former

19:05.761 --> 19:15.610
instructor, wanted to visit some of the areas 
around that he grew up in and knew. And so I offered

19:16.031 --> 19:17.612
my car. And of course, he wouldn't drive it, so I'd 
send my chauffeur to take him places, or take him

19:19.774 --> 19:25.520
myself. Well, in the course of this, I had him and 
his wife and his brother wife and son over for

19:31.021 --> 19:33.865
dinner. Then they invited us out. Each time, and 
one time I remember we went to the big monument

19:37.030 --> 19:43.239
there that's a famous place. We went various 
places, and we'd always invite, when we picked

19:45.182 --> 19:51.953
them up, we'd invite the brother to go along. So I 
guess four or five times I would return him with his

19:52.634 --> 19:56.860
brother

20:03.134 --> 20:11.667
Each time, the brother would ask me to put him off at 
a different place, sometimes as much as two blocks

20:03.134 --> 20:11.667
away from his apartment. Because it's true. So no 
one would see. It is absolutely true that out

20:15.753 --> 20:28.672
of every ten people, there's at least one 
listening

20:15.753 --> 20:28.672
for the system. Mm-hmm. and I'm sure that it works. 
I know that it works. Anyway, even as far and remote

20:34.407 --> 20:41.418
as that peasant was, he felt that influence. I 
guess what he really told me was that he only feels

20:41.438 --> 20:46.165
free when he's out in that forest. Nobody knows 
where he is. Nobody sees him. Tell me, what kind of

20:48.809 --> 20:50.652
man was George Kennan? He was a splendid 
ambassador. and a very brilliant man, I felt, and I

20:54.940 --> 20:59.705
was there just a matter of months with him. But he 
came in very ambitious to really pull Yugoslavia

20:59.925 --> 21:18.004
to an accord with us, not an alliance, but a better 
friendship, because Yugoslavia was truly now

20:59.925 --> 21:18.004
that government. We were friendly. But 
Yugoslavia was very instrumental in the Third

21:20.787 --> 21:24.711
World Movement. Sure. In the non-committed 
movement. And neutrals. And neutrals. And

21:32.569 --> 21:42.871
so Mr. Kennan felt that, in fact they were doing our 
policies some damage. And I remember first walk in

21:45.464 --> 21:48.267
the garden with Mr. Kennan. He had each of his 
section chiefs brief him on the situation, what we

21:48.347 --> 21:53.353
thought, and so forth. He wanted your ideas in 
addition to your information. And while I was

21:56.878 --> 22:06.629
military, I had to tell you, I was most interested 
in, outside of my area, I was most interested in the

21:56.878 --> 22:06.629
political section's work and followed and worked 
closely with them on that. I had gone down to the

22:08.552 --> 22:12.957
square in Belgrade to hear Tito make a speech. to 
the people after he'd visited the Western

22:13.966 --> 22:17.512
Hemisphere, visited the United States. And what 
he told those people angered me. He was very

22:26.085 --> 22:32.495
critical of the United States and our policies and 
the way we treat Mexico and one thing or the other.

22:32.515 --> 22:34.077
He didn't sound like a friend at all. And I guess 
this was just before Kennan got there. And that

22:39.245 --> 22:40.848
made a great impression on me. I could understand, 
see? the language he was speaking.

22:46.776 --> 22:52.881
And that really wasn't intended for our ears, and 
their press doesn't necessarily report it that

22:46.776 --> 22:52.881
way. But I remember in briefing, Mr. Ken and I 
brought that up. And I said, I cannot believe that

22:56.345 --> 23:03.391
we have a chance of ever really being friends with a 
communist country. And I thought this was the

23:03.932 --> 23:06.754
epitome of the evidence. But nonetheless, he was 
not deterred in his objectives. And I understand

23:13.248 --> 23:22.002
that he left Yugoslavia in great disappointment 
because things went from bad to worse. And as a

23:23.384 --> 23:41.432
matter of fact, they had the Unaligned Nations 
Conference there in Belgrade toward the end of his

23:23.384 --> 23:41.432
tour when Yugoslavia led them to pronouncements 
of policy that were even more clearly contrary to

23:43.471 --> 23:47.858
our interests. Now would you, did you ever have an 
opportunity to meet Tito? Yes, met him several

23:52.725 --> 23:54.107
times. And what, tell me about that. What were your 
impressions? Marshal Tito was a very impressive

23:58.373 --> 24:08.128
person, of course, just his presence, but 
whatever you think of him, As a communist, you've

24:08.733 --> 24:12.017
got to think of him as an accomplished man. And 
you've got to give him some respect for that. And I

24:18.366 --> 24:18.886
did. And personally, he's pleasant. I never spent 
a great deal of time with him, but I'd met him. Well,

24:24.814 --> 24:35.528
when Mr. Kennan came to present his credentials, I 
accompanied Mr. Kennan to Brioni, the island of

24:24.814 --> 24:35.528
Brioni, to present his credentials to Tito. And 
Tito gave him a great deal of time and, of course,

24:38.315 --> 24:45.726
great respect because Mr. Kennedy was then well 
known as a very prominent thinker in terms of

24:38.315 --> 24:45.726
foreign affairs. And we met him, met him and his 
wife at official functions several times, and of

24:47.429 --> 24:58.125
course observed him in ceremonies a number of 
times. He's a very interesting man. I might say I

25:01.990 --> 25:21.448
also traveled many of his battle areas of World War 
II when he and his partisans accomplished, you've

25:01.990 --> 25:21.448
got to admit, a great deal against the Germans, 
considering their limitations of resources.

25:23.910 --> 25:31.677
So I became

25:23.910 --> 25:31.677
convinced in my own mind that probably Most of the 
people in Yugoslavia admired him, respected him.

25:38.338 --> 25:41.641
He governed very effortlessly. He was one of those 
leaders that didn't have to speak many words or

25:42.642 --> 25:48.608
very loudly, it seemed. That's the impression you 
get. And all of this makes a very fine impression on

25:52.512 --> 25:59.959
any observer, Yugoslav or foreign. The fact is 
that I doubt that any nation in the world has a more

26:01.610 --> 26:11.264
effective police force than he had. And I've just 
alluded to it to some degree. And so don't give all

26:15.430 --> 26:30.672
the credit of everything going so smoothly and 
quietly to Tito, because the consequences of not

26:15.430 --> 26:30.672
going along are very severe. told Mr. Kennan, as a 
matter of fact, upon departure, when I was

26:30.922 --> 27:00.591
leaving, and again summarizing some of my views, I 
said, I am convinced, he had great admiration for

26:30.922 --> 27:00.591
Tito, and he felt, too, that the people respected 
him so well, and I told him, I think I gave this same

26:30.922 --> 27:00.591
view to him, but that I felt that if they had truly 
democratic elections in Yugoslavia, and allowed

27:01.904 --> 27:18.064
an opposition party to run on the platform of a 
democratic form of government, almost

27:01.904 --> 27:18.064
regardless of who that might be, that Tito would 
get 15% of the vote. 15? And that the opposition

27:19.465 --> 27:21.988
would get 85. Really? And I would have bet anything 
on it. And in other words, you didn't feel like...

27:27.675 --> 27:30.038
My reasoning was that There's about 3% of the 
population who are members of the Communist Party

27:30.828 --> 27:37.015
at that time. They've never had over five. There's 
10%

27:41.139 --> 27:50.569
that are dependent upon the Communist Party for 
their jobs and their future. And then there's a

27:52.351 --> 27:57.156
small percentage that really sympathize, very 
small, in my opinion. You don't think that Tito,

27:57.288 --> 28:03.015
after being that great war leader, was sort of a 
national hero? He was, but if he'd offered a

28:03.315 --> 28:09.743
democratic form of government, he'd been 
defeated soundly, in my opinion. What did Mr.

28:10.544 --> 28:12.407
Kennett say to that? This is not only from talking 
to peasants. I didn't finish that conversation on

28:15.170 --> 28:25.523
individuals, but I did find through those years 
opportunities to talk with individuals, some of

28:15.170 --> 28:25.523
them were prominent in the prior governments. 
Where did Mr. Kennan respond? Well, he was still

28:31.763 --> 28:36.009
just there a few months. I remember talking to a 
very learned and prominent Serbian individual,

28:36.229 --> 28:45.522
and he knows who I was. It's not often you can get 
this opportunity. I had great respect for the

28:48.546 --> 28:51.730
Serbs because Well, in this year of language 
school, what I was really studying was Yugoslav

28:52.385 --> 29:00.873
history and its military organization, customs, 
terms, and so forth. And I got a lot of that history

29:00.893 --> 29:03.776
that I'd never really studied before. And one 
remarkable thing about the history of

29:05.718 --> 29:21.092
Yugoslavia, which is now a grouping of nations, 
former nations, you know, you've got Serbia,

29:05.718 --> 29:21.092
you've got Croatia, Slovenia, Herzegovina. and 
Macedonia. But anyway, the Serbs, when they were

29:25.557 --> 29:42.960
invaded, captured, and taken over by the Turks, 
were under the Turkish heel for 500 years. They

29:44.202 --> 29:48.268
conducted 40 distinct revolutions and lost them 
all. They were finally freed by the results of

29:48.448 --> 29:51.552
World War won. But when that 500 years of Turkish 
dominance was over, they still had pure Serbian

29:53.922 --> 30:08.118
blood, they still had a pure Serbian language, and 
they still had a pure Orthodox Serbian religion.

30:09.539 --> 30:10.881
And I think that's remarkable. And I had never 
really focused on a history of a people that was so I

30:18.751 --> 30:22.456
thought valorous and so tenacious as theirs. So I 
asked this prominent Serb in the course of this

30:23.478 --> 30:30.908
conversation, I said, when are the Serbs going to 
get rid of communism?

30:33.651 --> 30:45.167
And citing my, noting their history of Turkish 
times, he said, I don't know that we ever can. Much

30:47.210 --> 30:48.572
as I and much as many of us would like to. But he said, 
we have something that has never been seen before.

30:56.712 --> 31:05.100
We have the most efficient police system

30:56.712 --> 31:05.100
that dominates us that anyone has ever known. He 
said, if I went to my best friend, and he and I

31:06.602 --> 31:17.192
decided that we were obligated and determined to 
do something to get rid of this communist

31:19.467 --> 31:31.262
government, we would have to go to others to gain 
enough strength that we could actually have the

31:19.467 --> 31:31.262
power to do something. He said by the time he went to 
his next best friend and I went to my next best

31:31.282 --> 31:39.172
friend, we'd be found out. He said, I'm convinced 
of that.

31:44.599 --> 31:48.124
That's what the people dislike most. about the 
Communist government, and that's one of the main

31:48.323 --> 31:57.255
reasons that I say Tito wouldn't have won his 
election if there was a Democratic alternative.

31:57.576 --> 32:03.343
How'd you like being a diplomat instead of a 
military man? I wasn't looking forward to that,

32:03.363 --> 32:05.166
but I enjoyed it. And I must say that

32:05.206 --> 32:12.436
we met very interesting people from all over the 
world. It was a wonderful experience, the whole

32:13.537 --> 32:17.082
thing, in all aspects. Uh, and the Yugoslav 
government, being a neutralist government,

32:18.057 --> 32:31.375
insisted we all mixed instead of in some, like in 
some of our country, Western friendly countries,

32:18.057 --> 32:31.375
you know, the, the Reds are kind of separated from 
the West. Sure. But, uh, we enjoyed that very much

32:33.037 --> 32:47.136
and we did, uh, a great deal of entertaining 
ourselves, um, including not only the military

32:33.037 --> 32:47.136
diplomats, but the, the ambassadors and others 
and, and became, uh, pretty good friends with some

32:47.977 --> 32:49.259
of them. Another hunter, by the way, was the 
Swedish ambassador—Finnish ambassador, I'm

32:50.741 --> 32:58.714
sorry—Vartti O'Vara. Of course, Finland is in a 
peculiar situation. I remember I had my only sauna

33:03.462 --> 33:06.106
bath in his embassy. They just can't live without 
those saunas, and there were two saunas, too.

33:15.989 --> 33:22.517
We bathed after dark so that after we had our bath we 
could go and close our pores by rolling in the snow.

33:24.160 --> 33:28.045
I caught pneumonia, damn near caught pneumonia. 
But anyway, we met some very interesting people

33:28.065 --> 33:37.717
and

33:28.065 --> 33:37.717
never regretted it a minute, even though we didn't 
want the job. Tell me about your relations with the

33:37.737 --> 33:39.439
Russians. The Russians had a very fine staff of 
diplomats. in Belgrade, because Yugoslavia was

33:45.537 --> 34:00.776
very important to them from the standpoint of

33:45.537 --> 34:00.776
controlling and diminishing the damage for no 
other reason. I became very well acquainted with

34:01.376 --> 34:07.083
their senior attache, military attache. I knew 
some of their diplomats, but they were hard to get

34:07.103 --> 34:12.830
to know, really. The Communist satellite 
attachés seemed to be a different breed than this

34:15.997 --> 34:20.003
Russian attaché. He was a combat soldier. He was a 
colonel. The others all seemed to be political

34:24.770 --> 34:34.284
officers in uniform and really weren't military 
men, really weren't military men. But anyway,

34:34.304 --> 34:39.993
Colonel Tarasevich and I became very good 
personal friends, as a matter of fact. He and his

34:42.737 --> 34:44.940
cohorts had a tiresome practice that they had to do 
under instruction. Every time in whatever

34:49.510 --> 35:02.542
formation, whether it was a diplomatic function 
or an out-of-shape trip that the U.S. laws were

34:49.510 --> 35:02.542
conducting or whatever, they had to make their 
points of the day. They were obligated to, I guess,

35:02.862 --> 35:06.225
by instruction. That got a little irritating, but 
after we got that discussion over with- What do you

35:06.245 --> 35:11.951
mean their points of the day? They had to discuss 
the merits of communism? They had this- For

35:16.139 --> 35:24.892
example, any significant point of difference 
between the U.S. and Russia of the moment, they'd

35:16.139 --> 35:24.892
state their position. One interesting one was, 
you'll recall that President Kennedy shortly

35:26.514 --> 35:45.522
after he was elected met with Khrushchev in 
Austria and Vienna, and they had a very heated

35:26.514 --> 35:45.522
argument, you'll recall, and Khrushchev 
threatened President Kennedy with what he called

35:46.717 --> 35:58.307
their rockets, their missiles, 
intercontinental missiles, and made a big point

35:46.717 --> 35:58.307
of this. Well, that created quite a stir, I don't 
know whether you recall it or not, throughout the

35:58.327 --> 36:15.643
international community, and so that was a good 
example of just reinforcing with anyone who'd

35:58.327 --> 36:15.643
listen Khrushchev's position in one, his 
statement in one. As a matter of fact,

36:17.311 --> 36:35.537
the Yugoslav Army was always trying to figure a way 
to get the attachés together about every three

36:17.311 --> 36:35.537
months and do something, either take them to 
Tito's battlefield or go skiing or go hunting.

36:36.279 --> 36:41.005
They had great pheasant and grouse hunting, for 
example, and hare hunting in addition. That's the

36:41.266 --> 36:44.871
kind they'd take the attachés on. And they kind of 
ran out of things to do, so one time they organized a

36:44.986 --> 36:48.570
shooting match. They had an Olympic-grade firing 
ranges there in Belgrade, and so they were going to

36:50.472 --> 37:07.371
have contests among the attachés firing the 
service rifle of Yugoslavia, the 22 rifle, and the

36:50.472 --> 37:07.371
service pistol.

37:10.414 --> 37:13.558
So each country was competing against the other. 
Well, and then we had a luncheon after the shooting

37:15.243 --> 37:21.230
to have the prizes awarded.

37:23.813 --> 37:32.122
And it was rather embarrassing to the Yugoslav 
because the first three places in all three events

37:23.813 --> 37:32.122
were won by American attachés.

37:36.067 --> 37:43.495
And I was seated by Colonel Tartasevich, the 
Russian attaché, and he turned to me with a glass of

37:36.067 --> 37:43.495
Slivovitza He says, that is excellent shooting. 
In Yugoslavia, of course, that is excellent

37:47.979 --> 37:51.283
shooting. He said, I fear that we're not as good as 
we should be today with the small arms. But he said,

37:58.051 --> 38:00.234
we sure are good with those rockets. And then 
laughed,

38:01.796 --> 38:06.041
you know. And I couldn't help but laugh, too. But we 
became good friends. We couldn't discuss

38:10.185 --> 38:15.850
politics, international politics, very long 
without getting into an argument. But I had him in

38:15.890 --> 38:19.253
my home several times. I never was in his. Why not, 
do you think? It would not have been right for him

38:23.737 --> 38:25.619
to. He could accept an invitation to my home, but he 
could not bring me into his. That is, to a small

38:29.582 --> 38:33.045
party. He's had all attitudes there. Sure. He 
couldn't show any favoritism toward you. He was a

38:40.641 --> 38:41.462
great fisherman. He always asked me to go fishing 
with him. In fact, one time when we had he and his

38:45.106 --> 38:55.617
wife and the Polish I had to share with his wife and 
one of my assistants and his wife for a small

38:45.106 --> 38:55.617
dinner.

38:55.637 --> 39:01.543
After dinner, during the course of the party, 
Tarasiewicz asked me, when are you going to go

38:55.637 --> 39:01.543
hunting with me? I said, well, I've got to go 
fishing. I do like to fish. He said, well, I go every

39:06.280 --> 39:09.345
Sunday, and I'm going next Sunday. I think this was 
a Friday night. And he said, I'd like for you to go

39:10.908 --> 39:12.411
with me. I said, I'll go. And he said, fine. So he 
kind of let it drop, and as he was leaving, he said,

39:16.357 --> 39:26.335
by the way, he said, we'll leave from such and such a 
place, you know, to go on that fishing trip. And he

39:26.355 --> 39:28.819
said, are you going to bring your wife? I said, oh, 
no, she doesn't. She detests fishing. He said,

39:34.308 --> 39:35.729
well, my wife's going to insist. She loves to fish. 
And I said, oh, I can't. My wife, I couldn't get her

39:40.334 --> 39:41.635
to go. Why don't you and I just go alone? And it 
became very clear that he couldn't go alone. And he

39:48.662 --> 39:52.466
thought probably the most liberal course he could 
take would be to take his wife.

39:55.328 --> 39:59.052
But anyway, and his wife was a nice person, sort of. 
sturdy peasant type, but a very fine person.

40:03.492 --> 40:04.774
They're children, by the way. But you never did go 
fishing? Never did go fishing, and it was my fault

40:06.256 --> 40:19.174
because the next day some, I forget who, but some 
senior officer came to Belgrade and I had to attend

40:06.256 --> 40:19.174
him, so I had to call it off. And by the way, I'm not so 
sure about what he felt that I was getting out of it,

40:19.194 --> 40:24.622
but I don't think he did.

40:27.606 --> 40:28.127
But, uh, Well, were you happy to leave after living 
in Yugoslavia for two years? I was ready to go. I

40:35.136 --> 40:42.683
think Fran could have enjoyed another year 
because she very much enjoyed that. She was very

40:42.723 --> 40:43.944
busy with it. All of these official functions and 
social events included her. I traveled over

40:50.030 --> 40:57.557
Yugoslavia, much of Yugoslavia, and frequently 
took her with me. And there was a purpose to those

40:58.448 --> 41:00.391
travels. And really, it was to observe. And I and my 
assistants just, on a pattern, covered that whole

41:04.737 --> 41:11.207
country constantly. And I guess I can say now- You 
sent back information back to Washington? Yes. I

41:16.836 --> 41:23.385
think I can say, you know, it was a licensed 
operation, you might say. Everybody knew. Now, we

41:25.188 --> 41:26.430
were more- had more privilege to travel than did 
the Communist Bloc because they couldn't travel

41:27.153 --> 41:34.181
freely. So they favored the Americans. Because of 
our aid to them, you see. Now we had to stay off

41:39.827 --> 41:49.037
military installations unless invited, and we 
had to stay off certain kilometers out of the

41:39.827 --> 41:49.037
border areas, but other than that we could travel. 
Fran enjoyed that too. She was always a little

41:51.239 --> 41:55.624
nervous about leaving the children, of course.

41:56.498 --> 41:57.299
poor little children. Our fourth was born there. 
And Chris, our third, had been born at the War

42:00.724 --> 42:04.269
College. But she had a good nursemaid and a good 
housekeeper. And

42:11.720 --> 42:21.634
the government paid for the servants save one. If 
you needed four, they'd pay for three. And I think

42:27.177 --> 42:29.060
that was a fair way to do it. In other words, that was 
to ensure that you didn't go overboard, I guess.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.809
Sure.

42:38.873 --> 42:42.838
Did you work with CIA people?

42:45.702 --> 42:48.166
I may have. But wasn't there CIA people right in the 
embassy? They were not identified if they were. So

42:57.417 --> 43:03.727
the staff was the ambassador and his State 
Department assistants, and then the military had

42:57.417 --> 43:03.727
a chase. Well, we had, yes. There was one from each? 
There was one from the Air Force, Army, and Navy?

43:09.696 --> 43:10.057
Yes. And of course, he had a very big political 
department, and a very big economic department,

43:10.918 --> 43:24.640
with secretaries, first secretary in charge of 
each. We worked very closely, of course, with both

43:24.890 --> 43:28.595
of them, but primarily the political.

43:31.459 --> 43:44.857
And then you left Yugoslavia in 1961 for a very 
short assignment as the executive officer of the

43:31.459 --> 43:44.857
2nd Infantry Division Artillery, and you only 
stayed there for four- gee whiz, for two months.

43:45.197 --> 43:46.279
Two months, uh-huh. And what was that, sort of a 
holding pattern? No, that was another

43:49.042 --> 43:50.965
interesting thing. Where was that? Fort Benning, 
Georgia, 2nd Infantry Division Artillery. I was

43:56.171 --> 43:57.392
the executive officer. It was a very interesting 
circumstance. I had just come back from

44:01.597 --> 44:15.432
Yugoslavia at what was considered an undesirable 
tour because, as I mentioned, we enjoyed it, but it

44:01.597 --> 44:15.432
was considered to be an undesirable tour,

44:01.597 --> 44:15.432
and assigned to the job I wanted. I asked to be 
assigned to a division artillery. And I thought

44:20.543 --> 44:29.174
that was a very good reward for whatever kind of a 
job I'd done, because they respected that wish.

44:31.076 --> 44:43.552
But about the time I got started there, this

44:31.076 --> 44:43.552
Cuban thing, I mean, this Berlin thing came up. 
Berlin Wall. Berlin Wall and that crisis. This

44:47.982 --> 44:57.895
added to Khrushchev's threat, had put the U.S. 
Army and Armed Forces into partial mobilization.

44:57.915 --> 45:12.053
And then

44:57.915 --> 45:12.053
this division was placed in a status to be deployed 
if this thing went further. And I was removed

45:12.073 --> 45:17.500
because of my recent return from overseas. In 
other words, I was not deployable.

45:23.384 --> 45:30.594
Because you just came back from overseas and 
because you probably didn't have enough

45:23.384 --> 45:30.594
experience to act as the executive officer in case 
of a crisis? No, that had nothing to do with it. I

45:32.096 --> 45:35.321
simply was not deployable by assignment 
policies. Oh, I see. And so they didn't want me to be

45:36.702 --> 45:44.213
there and then have to leave the day before the 
division left and have a guy come in completely

45:36.702 --> 45:44.213
green. And so they sent me to Fort Sill, which was 
kind of like throwing the rabbit out into the briar

45:45.593 --> 45:53.184
patch where he wants to be. Where you were deputy 
director of the Department of Gunnery and Office

45:55.027 --> 46:02.778
of Combat Development and Doctrine in the 
Artillery and Missile School. Tell me, did you

46:03.238 --> 46:08.005
teach in that function? I had lunch. Huh, what? 
Lunch is ready. Okay, we'll be in just a minute. No,

46:15.597 --> 46:17.320
I did not teach. The gunnery department, of 
course, is one of the key departments of the

46:18.621 --> 46:25.772
artillery school, and I was very happy to be there. 
I'd come in there very suddenly, you see, really,

46:26.033 --> 46:31.441
with very little planning time for the school. 
There's another one of those cases where I'd been

46:31.901 --> 46:39.833
sent to Fort Sill and they really didn't have a job 
for me. And so you were only there for just a few

46:41.129 --> 46:46.878
months, too, four months, November 61 to March 62. 
Were you just sort of waiting for more permanence?

46:51.125 --> 46:58.517
Well, by the time I'd been there this short time, 
then I was aligned to take over this combat

46:51.125 --> 46:58.517
developments department. And so I went in there as 
deputy for a while until the director left.
