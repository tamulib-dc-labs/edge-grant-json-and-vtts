WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:03.726
establishment. Where was it and how big was it? 
Well, it's just on the other side of the Brazos

00:05.150 --> 00:10.102
River Bridge at Highway 60. And it was just 
probably no more than a 20 by 30 size building. It

00:17.259 --> 00:19.103
was a relatively small place. And it was the 
closest place to Galley Station to buy liquor. It

00:22.002 --> 00:26.129
was right across the county line in whatever 
county that is. Burleson. Burleson County. What

00:28.373 --> 00:30.597
else did it offer for sale other than liquor? Well, 
beer and liquor. And that's maybe, you know, some

00:32.159 --> 00:36.186
jerky and the usual kind of stuff like that. No gas 
station or anything like that? No, no. It was just a

00:37.990 --> 00:39.472
liquor store. And was open? Well, I guess whatever 
the hours allowed under state law, I'm sure it was

00:41.830 --> 00:46.679
open full time. But the woman that ran it, she was 
still there when I came back as a faculty member. It

00:52.469 --> 00:54.433
was the same woman. Did you ever hear of a 
bootlegger in Brazos County? I never have. No. I'm

01:01.709 --> 01:04.734
sure there were, but I didn't know about them. 
There were, you know, there was a place out on, we

01:05.195 --> 01:16.774
heard about, that was out on the Brazos River that 
was supposedly a plantation that ran, you know,

01:05.195 --> 01:16.774
prostitutes and gambling. Great. We never did 
know exactly where that was, but it was one of those

01:18.196 --> 01:22.021
things you heard about. I think that had been there 
during the Bryan Air Force days. Oh, okay. Whether

01:31.552 --> 01:33.274
it still was or not, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know 
either. All right, how often did anybody bring

01:35.376 --> 01:42.685
liquor back to the dorm, be it beer or hard liquor? I 
guess frequently. I said that in the dorm we were

01:45.187 --> 01:55.281
in, they would take the medicine cabinet out of the 
wall, and there was a hollow space in there, and

01:45.187 --> 01:55.281
there were pipes, because the sink was right below 
it. And they could hang the liquor, put a string

01:55.341 --> 02:04.314
around a heavy nylon line around the bottle, and 
they'd drop it down where you couldn't see it. And

02:05.796 --> 02:09.301
one time, I think the story was that somebody 
dropped one down too far. And of course, they took

02:10.222 --> 02:13.667
it out, and it was from above, and it got caught. So 
you had to hang it just about right. Did anybody

02:16.768 --> 02:21.758
ever go in and steal somebody else's while they 
weren't in the room? I don't know. I'm sure it

02:22.900 --> 02:24.103
probably happened. Do you remember anybody 
getting caught by an inspection officer? Well, I

02:28.732 --> 02:32.820
never actually witnessed it, but I had heard that 
people had gotten caught. Let's see,

02:34.538 --> 02:47.900
back to dorm life, what about some jokes, some 
pranks, some good bull that you, during those two

02:34.538 --> 02:47.900
years that you heard of? Oh, yeah, yeah. There was 
always something that would go on. Describe some

02:50.584 --> 02:51.386
of that. One of the better ones was this guy that, 
his name was Hubert, Earl Hubert, and he was an

02:51.606 --> 03:01.322
upperclassman, and he he was was sort of the 
officious I guess might be a good way of describing

03:01.302 --> 03:30.330
his nickname was Earl the girl because he had sort 
of effeminate behaviors and Earl kept his keys on a

03:01.302 --> 03:30.330
on a chain you know and the chain was gonna go in his 
pocket and he would come up and unlock the door to

03:01.302 --> 03:30.330
his to his dorm room and with this key you know and it 
would still be attached to him and and so I wasn't

03:30.530 --> 03:36.581
actually in on doing it, but they got a bicycle 
inner tube and they tied it to the radiator. And

03:37.623 --> 03:51.407
then they used to take the end of a Coke carton and 
you saw the metal or wooden Coke cartons that

03:37.623 --> 03:51.407
carried the Coke bottles and they saw a thing and 
they were called fuck sticks because you could

03:52.366 --> 03:55.392
lock somebody in your dorm room with them. Well, 
they took one of those and put it on, they tied the

03:55.412 --> 04:08.957
bicycle inner tube to that and then, you know, 
stretched it and closed the door so that when Earl

03:55.412 --> 04:08.957
came up and stuck his key in and turned it, of 
course, it just, it took his belt off. And he got

04:09.545 --> 04:11.668
very upset about that. And another thing, and I was 
in on this, we moved his dorm room, all of his

04:11.828 --> 04:21.723
furniture to the shower and set it up inside the 
shower. And that was a thing that happened

04:23.545 --> 04:26.870
occasionally. What about anybody you hear of, an 
animal put into their room? Yeah, we got a bunch of

04:33.625 --> 04:37.409
dead rabbits one time, put them in somebody's 
room. Put them in a place where they weren't going

04:37.449 --> 04:42.836
to be found for a little while, up in the top of the 
closet, as I recall. Of course, they really

04:43.356 --> 04:45.639
started stinking in a day or so. Now, where did the 
rabbits come from? Where did anybody get the dead

04:49.043 --> 04:50.464
rabbits? Well, at that time, they had a program in 
the 60s where they killed off all the coyotes, and

04:50.705 --> 05:02.518
they paid ranchers and trappers to kill them, and 
they had this explosion of, of rabbits and rats.

05:05.737 --> 05:10.241
And, hey, you could go out on the road and, you know, 
about every ten feet there'd be a dead rabbit. It

05:10.261 --> 05:10.902
was amazing. There was one period in there was, you 
know. But, yeah, there were lots of dead rabbits

05:14.485 --> 05:18.850
you could find and roadkill, basically. Another 
good thing that they would do would be to babble

05:19.631 --> 05:27.178
bomb somebody. And you would, you know, You'd take 
the light bulb out of the room. There's just one big

05:34.086 --> 05:35.729
light up in the room. You could have a desk lamp. 
There's one big light bulb. You'd take that out and

05:38.835 --> 05:43.643
screw in a thing where you could plug a wire in, an 
extension cord. And then you would fray the ends of

05:44.204 --> 05:55.303
the extension cord and with the light off, you 
know, wrap them together and stick them down

05:44.204 --> 05:55.303
inside of a, which you could buy at that time, like 
M-80s or cherry bombs. And then you put that inside

05:56.009 --> 06:03.400
of a can of Babbo or one guy, they did it with pepper 
and I think he ended up in the hospital, you know.

06:03.420 --> 06:06.225
And this was in the animal company downstairs, E2. 
And of course, you go in, you turn the light on, this

06:07.006 --> 06:16.380
rather powerful firecracker, in fact, they're 
outlawed, you can't even buy them today, would go

06:07.006 --> 06:16.380
off and blow Babbo, or the one-case pepper all over 
the room. And, of course, it meant the freshmen

06:19.091 --> 06:28.744
then had to come and clean the room up, you know, and 
get rid of all this bad, which just went absolutely

06:19.091 --> 06:28.744
everywhere, you know. And then another thing that 
happened would be they would flood out

06:28.764 --> 06:33.931
dormitories. You got to go to...

06:37.716 --> 06:40.260
But they would flood out the dormitories. Now, 
this never happened, but there were stories that

06:40.320 --> 06:44.325
they would... know take all the tops off the 
toilets and water and this happened the year

06:44.710 --> 07:13.367
before i came and apparently people were still 
talking about it and they sort of filled the

06:44.710 --> 07:13.367
dormitory up with uh with water and you know you got 
to wonder why the university would allow this to go

06:44.710 --> 07:13.367
on you know and of course maybe they because you got 
to have done tremendous damage to the buildings

06:44.710 --> 07:13.367
you know plumbing and wiring and and everything in 
fact i think there was a very strong prohibition

06:44.710 --> 07:13.367
against doing that. One of the other dorms in that 
area did get flooded out and some of them would go

07:14.208 --> 07:32.279
into the steam tunnels and turn the water off to the 
building and then go in and take the tops off all the

07:14.208 --> 07:32.279
toilets and then go back down the steam tunnel and 
turn the water back on. Now, do you have any idea

07:33.221 --> 07:37.448
how, where they got into the steam tunnels? Well, 
there was a space in each

07:38.930 --> 07:47.039
where it came up into the dormitory. And it was in a 
closet that somebody had a key to. Did you ever go

07:50.827 --> 07:52.569
into a steam tunnel? No, I never did. Did you know 
where the entrance was? Well, there were some

07:55.193 --> 07:59.919
outside ones, too, where you could take the lid 
off. Like a manhole cover? Actually, more like a

08:01.661 --> 08:05.827
piece of plate steel was laying there. And you 
could see steam coming out of them at times,

08:06.568 --> 08:12.516
literally, in the right weather conditions. Do 
these tunnels still exist, as far as you know? I

08:15.299 --> 08:15.820
guess. I don't know. Somebody told me that that 
they had a lot of trouble with the buildings all

08:18.451 --> 08:25.863
along what was military walk, because there used 
to be a steam tunnel that went under that street.

08:25.943 --> 08:30.931
And when they tore the street out, they closed that 
in and filled in that steam tunnel. And it all

08:31.512 --> 08:33.656
created a real drainage problem. And that's 
between YMCA and academic and all of that, which

08:33.956 --> 08:42.771
was that when I came here as a faculty member, it was 
still a street. Were there ever any pranks at

08:42.791 --> 08:45.555
mealtime? Yeah. There were, you know, individual 
things where one upperclassman would get a

08:47.485 --> 08:57.277
freshman to do something to another 
upperclassman's food or something like that. Or

08:57.798 --> 09:06.528
the other thing was that there was always a 
military officer that ate in the dining hall and

08:57.798 --> 09:06.528
kind of sat over on a table. I think it was a little 
bit elevated. And I always wondered how the guy

09:07.930 --> 09:10.493
felt, you know. I mean, there eating by yourself. 
And occasionally there'd be another officer with

09:13.042 --> 09:18.778
him, but generally this guy's there by 
themselves. And occasionally what they would do

09:19.981 --> 09:28.806
is that on some command everybody would stand up 
and throw a bread roll over to this and hit this guy.

09:28.786 --> 09:32.890
And he took it with, I guess, a certain degree of 
affection. We really didn't hate him quite as bad

09:33.250 --> 09:38.034
as he might have thought or something. I don't 
know. And then there were other kinds of things on

09:40.076 --> 09:44.640
people's birthdays where things would do it. And 
there was an animal guy. In fact, that was his

09:47.082 --> 09:50.525
nickname, Animal, that was in E2. And there was 
this three-legged dog that ran around campus

09:51.246 --> 09:55.049
called Tripod. And I think it was probably a like a 
mixed golden retriever or Irish setter,

09:57.271 --> 10:05.804
something like that, the color of it. It was a big 
red dog with his left front leg missing. And Tripod

10:09.891 --> 10:13.356
got around just fine on the three legs. he would 
come into Sabisa Dining Hall and this guy would sit

10:13.707 --> 10:20.022
him in a chair next to him at the table and he would 
eat.

10:22.848 --> 10:24.893
And nobody said anything. It's kind of amazing. 
And let's see, and Ranger was around then, Mr.

10:25.795 --> 10:28.842
Rutter's dog. Right, he was, yeah. Describe. He 
was an English bulldog with a brachycephalic

10:31.308 --> 10:37.574
skull, a pushed in thing. And the youngest rudder 
boy used to come over. And he was a real kind of pest,

10:42.819 --> 10:48.664
as boys about 9 or 10 can be. And he was just looking 
for attention, I guess. He probably had no

10:51.967 --> 10:54.669
playmates on the campus. And he would come over 
with Ranger. And of course Ranger would bark at

10:58.983 --> 11:05.078
people and you know. Ann Rutter told me, in fact, 
that dog, they had a place out at Carter Lake, and he

11:05.176 --> 11:17.054
walked off the end of the pier and couldn't swim and 
apparently drowned, was the end of Ranger. And

11:17.915 --> 11:19.297
then he was buried over there. Oh, really? Oh, his 
grave's still marked. Really, where? Out there in

11:22.802 --> 11:24.364
front of the President's House. Is that? There's a 
little bitty. Oh, is that right? Yes. That I didn't

11:27.128 --> 11:28.631
know. I noticed that. Oh, okay. Over by where the 
old President's House was. No, no, no, no. Oh, the

11:35.028 --> 11:36.056
new president's house. The new president's 
house. Oh, that's right, because they would have

11:36.801 --> 11:40.549
burned it in 63 and Ranger died later on. As you go by 
you'll see four little posts and there's a little

11:40.850 --> 11:47.481
kind of a rope. I guess I've seen that. I didn't know 
what that was. That's Ranger's Lass.

11:54.754 --> 11:55.936
Can he see the scoreboard? I don't think. Did you 
all ever attempt to play any tricks on faculty

11:59.302 --> 12:05.312
members in class or anything? No. I don't ever hear 
of anybody doing that. The only thing that even,

12:12.951 --> 12:26.753
and this wasn't a trick, but I took organic 
chemistry and we worked on this lab project for

12:12.951 --> 12:26.753
ages and, you know, I mean like two lab periods. In 
the end, obviously, something went wrong. The

12:28.875 --> 12:32.620
thing foamed up, and it went all over the bench and 
everything. And so we had to turn in this

12:32.680 --> 12:37.946
precipitate that we got in the end. And so we looked 
at what other people had, and we went over and found

12:38.006 --> 12:42.451
something on the shelf. And we said, yeah, that's 
it. So we put it into the bottle, and we turned it in.

12:47.677 --> 12:54.125
And the next lab period, this guy is Rakoff. He 
says, you know, halter? I want to see you for a

12:55.927 --> 12:57.750
minute. And he said, what the hell did you all put in 
that bottle? And we just played innocent. We had to

13:05.143 --> 13:07.627
redo the experiment on our own time. We always 
imagined that he probably had something he poured

13:08.008 --> 13:14.519
into it, tested it, and it had to turn some color or 
do something. And he poured it in and it blew up in

13:14.539 --> 13:16.602
his face. That's what we expected, maybe. What did 
you and your friends come to believe were the

13:19.012 --> 13:31.206
general guidelines about class attendance and 
class behavior and so forth at A&M? Well,

13:31.226 --> 13:33.408
attendance was something you did. You didn't miss 
class, you know. Now there were people who would do

13:35.571 --> 13:44.361
that, but by and large I think the class attendance 
was, and the expectations were that, If you were

13:44.628 --> 13:49.455
called on in some classes, you'd stand up to 
answer. Like military science classes, you had to

13:49.535 --> 13:54.962
pop to attention if you were called on to answer a 
question. I don't think other classes did that.

13:56.604 --> 14:02.833
But it was the expectation where you shut up and you 
behaved yourself. But I don't know that there was

14:03.073 --> 14:04.836
ever any problem. I don't remember there being 
behavior anymore than there are today.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.306
Occasionally, you have people who who act up in 
class, but what I found is the other students

14:12.522 --> 14:19.313
generally discipline them, and you don't have to 
really do very much. Do you remember anybody

14:19.673 --> 14:22.157
getting in trouble for going to sleep? Oh, yeah, 
including me. What happened? Well, I had to stand

14:25.522 --> 14:27.445
up the rest of the class period.

14:31.952 --> 14:36.299
You'd never get away with that today, I suspect.

14:37.361 --> 14:40.926
How did you, that first semester, how did you come 
out academically here? Oh, I didn't do very well. I

14:42.808 --> 14:59.148
think part of it was, you know, there was I guess a 
lot of the stuff, the hazing you took personally,

14:42.808 --> 14:59.148
you know, and you probably shouldn't have, but you 
know, I don't know, it just wasn't my character I

14:42.808 --> 14:59.148
guess to, and there was a lot of crap that went on, 
you know. Did you think about leaving? Yeah. Why

15:02.672 --> 15:03.353
didn't you? Well, if you wanted to be a 
veterinarian, you had to go to A&M. So you came back

15:07.481 --> 15:09.203
the next year. So was the spring semester better? 
Oh, yeah, I don't think there was any question

15:12.646 --> 15:16.209
about spring, you know, coming back. And, you 
know, coming back the next year may have been more

15:16.309 --> 15:22.234
the question, you know. But I came back for, you 
know, my third year in college. And when did you

15:26.798 --> 15:32.563
begin to think about something other than 
veterinary medicine? I think it's when it's

15:33.455 --> 15:38.875
obvious that you weren't doing well enough in the 
science classes. I never caught on to organic

15:39.310 --> 15:44.335
chemistry, and that was a real weed-out course for 
vet school. And some of the other anatomy things

15:45.076 --> 15:55.866
that you had to do, and somehow an animal soaked in 
formaldehyde that you had to cut up just wasn't my

15:45.076 --> 15:55.866
idea of a lot of fun. And you knew that in vet school, 
it was a quarter section of a horse that you had to

15:55.906 --> 16:03.053
work on. Because a horse is, I don't know, it's 
still the basis of anatomy. I don't know, it was

16:06.496 --> 16:07.658
just a lot of that. Also, you know, when I went home 
like in the summer, and other times I worked for

16:07.999 --> 16:21.501
this veterinarian in Wichita Falls, and the more I 
saw what you did as a veterinarian, and you know, it

16:07.999 --> 16:21.501
really was hard work. You know, and I think at that 
time you got $15 for a spay or neutering of an

16:21.522 --> 16:29.134
animal. A lot of work for not much money. And I 
remember one afternoon, we were at a long

16:31.825 --> 16:43.959
operation, and it's hot, you know, Wichita Falls 
is summer, sweating, and you think, man, I kind of

16:31.825 --> 16:43.959
wish this animal would die so I can get the hell out 
of here. That's probably not the attitude you need

16:43.979 --> 16:46.462
if you're going to be a veterinary.

16:49.485 --> 16:56.533
That second year, did you have some classes, some 
instructors that were important? Yeah, well, I

16:57.037 --> 17:00.460
think you were, as I said, as a Civil War class. Why 
did a pre-vet take a course in that? I don't know. I

17:05.244 --> 17:09.048
changed my major, you know, to history and 
political science. What led you to make that

17:10.069 --> 17:11.550
change? I think I just always enjoyed history. And 
I had Blue Book Benton for government, as it was

17:14.873 --> 17:24.782
called back then, state and local government, 
207. the first course, American National

17:25.218 --> 17:29.785
Government at Midwestern from John Tower. And 
then Tower described

17:31.788 --> 17:38.719
Professor John Tower. Well, Professor John Tower 
is only about three feet tall. Most people don't

17:42.805 --> 17:44.628
know. He's not that short. No, I know. He's five 
foot something. He's a very short guy. And he was

17:49.355 --> 17:52.440
very cocky. He, you know, had these really 
immaculate suits that he wore to class and he had

17:52.420 --> 18:05.029
this fedora hat that he would come in with it on. 
impeccably dressed, and it was quite a sort of

18:05.482 --> 18:08.906
show. And he had by that point been converted to 
republicanism, and that in itself was sort of a

18:09.507 --> 18:19.440
surprise. And I think he was, a lot of what he said 
and did, I don't think I realize it, was very

18:20.261 --> 18:27.270
political. in his approach to things. Now, he was a 
full-time faculty member. Yes. Was that, I guess,

18:35.683 --> 18:37.768
a lecture? I don't know. In hindsight, was it 
obvious that he was aiming for elected No, it was

18:42.843 --> 18:44.025
not. It was not obvious at all. But the next year, he 
did. I guess it was 61, wasn't it? Because, yeah,

18:50.977 --> 18:52.640
special election, 1961. So I was here at A&M. 
Describe his capability as a as a teacher, as a

18:58.790 --> 19:00.572
lecturer? Oh, he was interesting. He was 
engaging, you know, and kept your attention. He

19:05.038 --> 19:07.322
told lots of stories. He had run for the 
legislature as a Democrat sometime in the 50s. Of

19:14.351 --> 19:21.000
course, there weren't any Republicans in Wichita 
County at that time except his father-in-law,

19:14.351 --> 19:21.000
Orville Bullington. who ran for governor in 32 
against Ma Ferguson as a Republican, did rather

19:20.980 --> 19:26.210
well. And he was an oil man, came down from 
Pennsylvania and bought his Republican, this is

19:27.132 --> 19:34.166
Orville Bullington. Centaur, after he married 
Bunny Bullington, his first wife, really, I

19:37.973 --> 19:42.359
guess, began the conversion to Republicanism. 
And I think his father-in-law was a big influence

19:42.379 --> 19:45.443
on him. He told lots of interesting stories about 
politics. And he'd run for the state legislature

19:48.287 --> 19:56.539
along with another guy that ran They campaigned 
together, and I don't remember now which seats

19:56.519 --> 20:14.468
they were in for, but the guy worked for Lyndon 
Johnson and was caught in a homosexual encounter,

19:56.519 --> 20:14.468
remember, in a restroom during the 64 campaign. 
What is that guy's name? Anyway, worked for Lyndon

20:16.752 --> 20:22.079
Johnson, went back to Austin after that and worked 
at KLBJ I think. I'll think of his name anyway. How

20:25.224 --> 20:38.121
would, as you think back, how would you rank John 
Tower's intellectual, was it a good solid course?

20:38.141 --> 20:39.163
I think so, yeah. Was he politically biased? Oh 
yeah. But did your answers have to be biased? Well,

20:45.153 --> 20:49.744
I think they were, I don't know that they had to be. 
He gave a kind of a cross between short answer and

20:51.509 --> 20:58.587
multiple guess and matching type. How rigorous 
was the course? I didn't find it very hard, but I

21:01.910 --> 21:09.040
guess I had a talent or an ability in that area, not 
in organic chemistry. All right, now you and I both

21:09.520 --> 21:13.246
know that Gene Benton was a legendary teacher 
here. You're the first person I've interviewed

21:14.427 --> 21:25.943
yet that had him in class, so supply as much 
information for the future about Gene Benton as

21:14.427 --> 21:25.943
the teacher from a student's point of view. Gene 
was very interesting. He's a walking

21:28.828 --> 21:34.178
encyclopedia of Texas government. His first 
book, which I have at home, I have most of the other

21:35.300 --> 21:46.260
editions here, to a large degree was ripped off by a 
lot of the other Texas government textbook

21:35.300 --> 21:46.260
people. It's amazing if you go and look at all of 
these, how many of them are simply quoting other

21:46.240 --> 21:53.028
books in Texas government. I mean, there's no 
primary source, and some of them are really bad

21:53.048 --> 21:57.773
academically. And they rely upon Benton for their 
information. And so here you have the guy that's

22:02.638 --> 22:05.401
teaching the class. He wrote the book, which 
really helped a lot. And I basically went through

22:07.704 --> 22:11.488
and outlined the book in great detail. His 
lectures, when he would lecture, he never looked

22:11.468 --> 22:15.937
at the students. He always looked in another 
direction or something else. If you asked him a

22:22.090 --> 22:25.757
question, he would momentarily look you directly 
in the eye. But he would stand there and talk for the

22:26.519 --> 22:32.852
entire 50 minutes, just a constant. stream of 
information and really, I say, encyclopedic

22:32.832 --> 22:41.025
knowledge of aspects of the Texas legislature. 
You go back and look at the first edition. Later

22:42.828 --> 22:50.881
editions, and I expect it was editorial changes, 
weren't quite that way, weren't quite as

22:42.828 --> 22:50.881
legalistic, detailed. God, I mean the footnotes 
in that first book are just incredible, the

22:52.343 --> 22:57.692
detailed information. Kind of a, almost a Milton 
Nance kind of, the Mere Expedition type, you know

22:57.672 --> 23:07.643
what I mean, by that detail and footnoting and 
things, yeah. But, you know, I, a lot of people

23:07.663 --> 23:17.794
really didn't like him because, you know, he spoke 
in almost a monotone and he didn't look, but there

23:07.663 --> 23:17.794
was a lot of information coming out there. Any 
humor? Very little. And

23:21.179 --> 23:31.352
did he tolerate any pranks or jokes or any student 
not paying attention? I don't think anybody would

23:31.372 --> 23:33.896
have dared do that, you know. I mean, he had a 
reputation of being a, I mean, his nickname was

23:34.516 --> 23:38.021
Blue Buck Benton. Yeah, I know, but this machine 
doesn't. Why was he Blue Buck Benton? He would say,

23:41.986 --> 23:44.493
well, the exam will be Thursday of next week. Bring 
two blue books. And the expectations were that you

23:46.418 --> 23:51.533
filled up a couple of blue books answering the 
questions. It was right like hell, basically. If

23:53.819 --> 23:57.008
you didn't have, if you forgot your blue book, what 
happened? I never did. I don't know of anybody that

23:58.030 --> 23:59.533
ever did. I

23:59.553 --> 24:15.402
used to tell students, I still do, I say, if you 
forget your blue book, I will have some available

23:59.553 --> 24:15.402
for sale in class on that day, and they cost three 
dollars each. How rigorous was the course? It was

24:18.969 --> 24:19.851
very rigorous. I made a B in it. I felt I deserved an 
A. But I don't know that Gene gave A's. Maybe he did.

24:30.311 --> 24:33.036
And I had one of the better grades in the class. And 
he didn't grade on the curve. I don't know that he

24:36.862 --> 24:38.204
did, no. I don't think so. And, you know, back then, 
92 and above was an A, you know, so you could have a 90

24:40.208 --> 24:47.179
and, you know. But he didn't give numerical 
grades, as I remember he gave, like pluses and

24:47.840 --> 24:56.053
minuses, A minus, B plus, and so on. Did you ever 
have many conversations with him out of class

24:57.653 --> 25:04.528
about political science and so forth? No. He 
wasn't real approachable. And I think that was

25:07.995 --> 25:17.856
true via accurate observation when I came back as a 
faculty member, you know, that he didn't He didn't

25:17.836 --> 25:19.859
interact much with the students. He was not here 
much except during office hours, and he was

25:19.899 --> 25:25.327
faithful to that. There was absolutely nothing in 
his office. Maybe a phone book and nothing else.

25:32.257 --> 25:41.650
And that was because I didn't know at the time, but 
later on he told me that when he was a faculty member

25:32.257 --> 25:41.650
at SMU, where he taught John Tower, incidentally, 
that

25:41.630 --> 26:00.969
John Birchers decided he was a communist, and they 
went to his office looking for evidence that he was

25:41.630 --> 26:00.969
a communist in the Bircher-McCarthy days, and so 
he never kept anything in his office, which I found

25:41.630 --> 26:00.969
peculiar. Were his lectures objective? I think 
so, but probably with a liberal bent would be my

26:06.034 --> 26:10.759
evaluation. I'm not real sure I was sophisticated 
enough to pick up on those things at the time. And I

26:17.411 --> 26:26.347
must admit, I remember coming home and saying some 
things around my father who once had a picture of

26:17.411 --> 26:26.347
Roosevelt on the wall. We did not have candles and a 
kneeling rail, but we could have. And saying some

26:31.917 --> 26:44.314
things about Roosevelt or the Democrats or 
something like that, and getting quite a reaction

26:31.917 --> 26:44.314
from my father, and I didn't do that again. What? 
Stuff that John Tower had said in class. Oh, oh, oh.

26:49.160 --> 26:52.845
You know, and so I come home and say, well, 
Professor Tower says. It's really interesting in

26:52.825 --> 27:14.729
this, there's this thing in here about can Bush be 
elected and there's the Hispanic from San Antonio

26:52.825 --> 27:14.729
that has the big huge advertising firm and he's one 
of the people that they're quoting and this is

26:52.825 --> 27:14.729
really interesting because I had this same 
experience. He says here,

27:18.273 --> 27:24.739
this is Lionel Sosa, was preteen when an 
independent street with his father brought home a

27:25.411 --> 27:30.898
television set for the family in San Antonio in 
1952. When he turned it on, the Republicans were

27:31.439 --> 27:36.625
anointing Dwight David Eisenhower as a nominee 
for president. The youngster was mesmerized. My

27:38.588 --> 27:41.131
parents said, Lionel, you can't be like Reich. 
He's a Republican. The 61-year-old Sosa

27:42.793 --> 27:47.078
remembers today, we've always been Democrats. 
Republicans are the party of the rich, and we're

27:47.118 --> 27:50.102
the poor. And the Democrats are the party of the 
poor. I said, well, then who the hell wants to be

27:53.406 --> 27:55.970
poor? And that's why I was rebelling. Well, I 
remember having a very similar experience, and

27:58.213 --> 28:02.238
this is in Oklahoma City in 1952. And I came home 
with an I Like Ike button on, which somebody had

28:03.380 --> 28:07.846
given me at school. And my grandmother gave me this 
lecture about we don't wear those kinds of things.

28:16.137 --> 28:17.980
and removed the button. As you look back on it, did 
Gene Benton for you become a kind of an

28:19.001 --> 28:27.014
intellectual role model?

28:30.059 --> 28:31.461
I don't think so. Political science, a faculty 
member? Maybe to some degree, yeah. I hadn't

28:37.090 --> 28:41.997
really decided on political science at that 
point. In fact, I really didn't. until I decided to

28:44.082 --> 28:46.044
go to graduate school. As an undergraduate, I got a 
double major in history and political science.

28:51.148 --> 28:53.490
And it was kind of a decision about which way do you 
go. And I think part of the experience I had at

28:53.531 --> 29:09.405
Midwestern with some of the faculty members that 
really encouraged me to go on to graduate school

28:53.531 --> 29:09.405
was maybe why I went in that direction. All right. 
Here, that second year, whom did you turn to for

29:10.326 --> 29:14.089
academic advice? Well, for you, to a large degree, 
about, you know, I still remember you talking

29:14.069 --> 29:23.444
about, I was already considering graduate 
school. Remember you told me you need to go to the

29:23.504 --> 29:30.835
best graduate school your time and abilities will 
get you into, and time, abilities, and money will

29:23.504 --> 29:30.835
get you into. And, you know, I did a master's degree 
at Midwestern. And part of it, you know, you had a

29:38.268 --> 29:44.315
pretty low academic fall at A&M. And then you have 
to dig your way out of that, you know, which you

29:45.035 --> 29:51.262
managed to do at Midwestern. And I guess the 
redemption, and that included going on to

29:51.562 --> 29:56.188
graduate school. And then you had enough whatever 
to do, do well enough on the GRE and enough grades

29:56.248 --> 30:04.917
and recommendations to get into graduate school. 
Now, that second year here, do you remember what

30:04.897 --> 30:13.549
you, you went your sophomore and junior year here. 
Do you remember what your GPA was when you left?

30:16.353 --> 30:17.655
Right around a 2.0. 2.0? Well, 1.0 back then. Oh, 
yeah, yeah, about 2.0. About 2.0 by today's

30:22.862 --> 30:25.525
standards. And so you had changed your major. 
Anybody else you turned to for advice? Was there an

30:31.814 --> 30:34.777
associate dean or an assistant dean? No. I do 
remember meeting with Hubert when I changed my

30:37.701 --> 30:41.806
major. He was, I think, dean of arts and sciences at 
that point. Do you describe that? I don't remember

30:49.256 --> 30:53.601
much about it, but I just remember, and then years 
later when I came back, for an interview for the

30:54.155 --> 30:57.394
faculty position, I met with the same guy. I don't 
think I mentioned that to him. All right. Describe

31:05.247 --> 31:11.298
the MSC and its role for an undergraduate during 
your years here. What was the MSC? What did that

31:14.603 --> 31:15.605
mean to you? Well, we'd go over there maybe in the 
afternoons to have coffee or something like that.

31:20.934 --> 31:26.704
And I got interested and involved with SCONA my 
junior year. How did that come about? just

31:29.002 --> 31:30.788
interest in politics. And here's a program that's 
bringing in political speakers from outside.
