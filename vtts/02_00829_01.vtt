00:01.313 --> 00:02.975
I am interviewing Nelson M. Duller. He's a 
professor of physics. He lives at 818 North

00:05.197 --> 00:10.123
Rosemary in Bryan. Now, as a matter of formality, 
I'll ask, you know, I have to ask your name. Okay. So

00:14.207 --> 00:15.569
what's your name, Dr. Duller? Nelson M. Duller, 
and as you say, I'm a professor of physics and live

00:15.629 --> 00:23.558
in Bryan, Texas. And you divide your activities in 
between teaching and research. Yes, teaching and

00:27.682 --> 00:30.966
research are my activities here at A&M. Okay. Why 
did you originally come here? And when and why did

00:35.419 --> 00:36.921
you originally come here? When I first came to A&M, 
I came here as a student

00:37.322 --> 00:45.454
back in, this is January of 1946. And I was, I had 
gone to school, to college before that time, to a

00:47.518 --> 00:54.008
university. I had gone to Rice before that time. 
But my education had been interrupted by the war,

00:57.052 --> 01:02.057
World War II. And I had spent two years at Rice as a, 
not in physics or science, but actually as a, well,

01:02.077 --> 01:14.310
mainly a liberal arts major in preparation, what I 
thought would be for the law. I was preparing

01:14.550 --> 01:26.923
what's called a pre-law undergraduate program at 
Rice, which included a lot of language and

01:14.550 --> 01:26.923
economics, but with some math and science, of 
course. and philosophy and economics and all

01:27.511 --> 01:33.399
those things.

01:34.942 --> 01:40.429
But the war came along, and I was involved with the 
war for three years or so. And when I got out of the

01:41.651 --> 01:53.548
Army, I had thought a lot about going back to 
college just before I was about to be discharged.

01:54.790 --> 01:56.472
And I had decided that that I wanted to study either 
engineering or science, like physics, something

01:56.722 --> 02:05.253
of that sort, instead of law. I decided against law 
for reasons which I really can't explain. I think

02:08.257 --> 02:11.181
it was just a matter of drifting away from it. 
During the time I was in the Army, I'd had some

02:11.461 --> 02:14.566
science. I'd gone to New York University in a 
special program, which they called in those days

02:14.886 --> 02:23.978
the Army Specialized Training Program, ASTP, 
which is kind of known to those who were involved

02:24.751 --> 02:29.478
with university work in the Army days. They picked 
out people who were interested in going to school

02:29.559 --> 02:35.949
and sent some of us to school. I was in New York 
University, and I got my first real good physics

02:36.449 --> 02:41.798
there in math and things like that. And I decided 
that I wanted to go into science, in particular

02:41.838 --> 02:46.906
physics, in math. Well, when I got out of the Army, 
it was in December of 1945.

02:53.877 --> 02:57.082
And I was leaning toward A&M anyway. I knew A&M was a 
good school. A&M sort of runs in my family. My

03:03.311 --> 03:07.998
brother had gone to A&M, and my uncles, and 
everybody I knew had gone to A&M except me. I was the

03:08.178 --> 03:09.320
only one who had gone to Rice. I like Rice just fine. 
Rice is a very good school. Although I don't think

03:12.624 --> 03:14.367
it's quite as great now as I used to think it was for 
some various completely spurious reasons. Some

03:23.070 --> 03:26.355
of the attitudes the students have at basketball 
games is pretty bad. But anyway, I came to A&M

03:26.375 --> 03:33.405
because my brother got out of the Army almost 
immediately after I did. And he and I decided we'd

03:33.465 --> 03:36.350
go to school together here. And I could come here in 
mid-year, which was a great advantage, and go in

03:36.911 --> 03:43.240
the summers, as you know, or maybe you don't know, 
at Rice. They don't have summer school. And they

03:45.760 --> 03:48.645
don't allow students to enter at mid-year. They 
don't have a regular semester. They have a year

03:50.147 --> 03:51.049
long. They don't have students entering in 
January. At least they didn't in those days. And to

03:55.496 --> 03:57.980
my knowledge, they still don't. So these various 
circumstances led me to come here, at least on a

03:58.000 --> 04:03.689
trial basis. And once I got here, I liked it so much 
that I wouldn't have considered leaving. And as I

04:07.418 --> 04:09.564
say, I came in January of 1946. And I came in just 
before the biggest influx of veterans, so-called

04:10.707 --> 04:19.771
veterans, people who had been in the Army or Navy or 
whatever. And the January... influx of veterans

04:22.792 --> 04:26.598
was pretty big, but then in the fall, they really 
came in. We were three and four to a room, normally

04:26.618 --> 04:31.205
we're meant for two, that sort of thing. But it was 
good. We were all pretty, quite serious and

04:32.988 --> 04:35.632
interested in our work. We were all a little older, 
of course, than most undergraduates were in those

04:35.652 --> 04:45.627
days, or most undergraduates had been, rather, I 
should say. And I liked A&M very much immediately.

04:49.479 --> 04:52.384
I liked just everything about it. It was a good 
place to be. I got to get away from, for

04:55.568 --> 05:10.872
one thing, from home again, which was kind of 
important to me because I don't think I could have

04:55.568 --> 05:10.872
just sat around at home and studied after being 
away for not so long in the war and all that sort of

04:55.568 --> 05:10.872
thing. And being here, the general atmosphere was 
conducive to serious work and enjoying being with

05:12.100 --> 05:20.315
a bunch of other students. And of course, we had 
good times. We'd go into Houston, visit with our

05:22.299 --> 05:24.984
friends. And at that time, of course, I wasn't 
married.

05:30.173 --> 05:36.184
I wasn't very young, but I was still young enough to 
wait to be married. Nobody had cars except a few

05:36.839 --> 05:39.142
guys here and there. We'd all gang up and either 
hitchhike or ride in the weekend. But it was A&M,

05:43.769 --> 05:52.241
surprisingly, I'll be able to say A&M's changed a 
lot. And I'll just say that, to me, A&M hasn't

05:52.261 --> 05:57.047
changed all that much. A&M has always been a very 
good school, from my point of view. In those days it

06:01.763 --> 06:13.303
was great because there was the basic spirit, good 
traditions, things that were fun and worthwhile.

06:14.345 --> 06:16.208
And the same kinds of things are here now. The 
difference is other people have joined A&M. Now,

06:20.512 --> 06:38.738
of course, and we'll get to this later on, I'm sure, 
we have people who are not necessarily in the

06:20.512 --> 06:38.738
Corps, but who, I think, by and large, have similar 
spirits, similar attitudes, and lots of same

06:20.512 --> 06:38.738
basic feelings toward an end that the Corps does, 
and had in those days. The Corps being almost

06:40.020 --> 06:41.903
inclusive. Of course, as a veteran, we weren't in 
the Corps. Most of us weren't. But I... Well, I just

06:49.435 --> 06:54.660
remembered it as a very good place to work and enjoy 
fellowship with other students. And it was

06:56.862 --> 07:02.007
academically very sound, challenging to me. And 
so I stayed. I graduated in 1948. Got a degree in

07:09.955 --> 07:12.798
1948. I guess it was in June of 48. I can't think of 
it. So

07:21.565 --> 07:27.194
then I left A&M. At that time, A&M's graduate work 
in physics didn't have the same

07:27.394 --> 07:37.209
history or whatever the word is. It wasn't 
established as well as the graduate work in

07:37.830 --> 07:45.582
physics at certain other universities in the 
country. And this was true a lot of places, because

07:46.169 --> 07:49.374
A&M wasn't alone in that regard. So for graduate 
work, in fact, there hadn't been any PhDs at all

07:49.935 --> 07:56.305
granted at A&M in physics. And I had good advice 
from Dr. James Potter, who was head of the

07:56.605 --> 08:08.925
department then and was for many years 
subsequently, to go off to graduate school. And I

08:09.005 --> 08:13.392
went to Rice, went back to Rice to go to graduate 
school in physics. And I guess it was five years

08:14.603 --> 08:20.069
later I got a degree, a Ph.D., in 1953.

08:22.212 --> 08:36.048
Now, I'm not telling you much about the way A&M was 
in those days, but I have hinted that, of course, it

08:22.212 --> 08:36.048
was all male in those days, but at least as far as I 
remember it was. I don't know if there were any

08:36.068 --> 08:37.430
girls there at all. There were, of course, ladies, 
and I know there were lots of married students. And

08:42.498 --> 08:47.723
I knew lots of my friends were married, and I got to 
know the families and children and so forth. But

08:49.124 --> 08:56.872
I was pretty much all business in those days. I 
wasn't a member of any organizations, and I didn't

08:57.953 --> 09:02.717
run for any offices of any sort. I felt that my main 
goal was to be in school. And so that's really what I

09:10.055 --> 09:11.997
did. I just went to school. But I enjoyed the 
general atmosphere. And as I say, I made a lot of

09:17.181 --> 09:34.436
lifelong friends, people whom I still know well 
and see often, in some cases, not so often in

09:17.181 --> 09:34.436
others, how far away they are and so forth. But I 
remember distinctly that the distance between

09:34.456 --> 09:39.420
College Station and Bryan in those days like the 
distance between two little towns, you really

09:39.974 --> 09:44.160
went on a country road. You went down Texas Avenue 
to go from here to Bryan. We used to go into Bryan to

09:48.546 --> 09:51.129
go to a picture show now and then. There was a show 
downtown, so to speak. And when you rode along

09:55.034 --> 10:00.622
Texas Avenue, you'd ride on a bumpy country 
highway. I can't think what to compare it with

10:01.984 --> 10:09.053
exactly around here, but it was a turtleback 
highway. a road with a lot of trees on either side

10:09.674 --> 10:16.442
and deep ditch, deep ditches and windmills and a 
few farms here and there. And you go from one town to

10:16.502 --> 10:21.007
another, you really knew you went to another town. 
They really weren't contiguous cities as they are

10:21.067 --> 10:27.735
now at Colley Station and Bryan. I remember that 
very distinctly. I remember that Guyon Hall was

10:30.478 --> 10:39.529
used in those days to show movies quite regularly, 
whereas Guyon Hall doesn't exist anymore. And

10:39.897 --> 10:52.773
there was that movie, and there was a movie at the 
North Gate, which is still there, the campus

10:39.897 --> 10:52.773
theater, which a lot of us used to go to just for fun, 
especially on Sunday nights. That was a time to

10:52.813 --> 10:55.356
goof off because the long week was ahead. But 
that's one of the most distinct memories I have

10:56.617 --> 11:06.850
about the community in those days is that really 
they were a really separate little town,

10:56.617 --> 11:06.850
separated. I don't remember distinctly about 
College Avenue. College Avenue may have been more

11:09.385 --> 11:21.082
nearly continuous in the sense of residences, but 
I gather, as I remember, though, there were some

11:09.385 --> 11:21.082
vacant lots and some open country in there. I just 
beg to remember that. Because I know going to town,

11:24.366 --> 11:32.558
we always seem to go on Highway 6 to go into Bryan. 
One thing we used to do was go into... to a lady's

11:34.792 --> 11:39.538
home who had served family-style meals. We were on 
a real treat. There was a lady named Mrs. Ball,

11:41.040 --> 11:47.448
whose sister maybe still runs the cafeteria out at 
the Annex. I'm not sure about that. That's the same

11:48.650 --> 11:50.172
family, anyway. Anyway, you'd go to that home, and 
she had a nice big kitchen in the back, and guys

11:51.294 --> 12:04.731
would go in the living room and go into the big 
dining room there and sit at a table and have

11:51.294 --> 12:04.731
family-style meals, which was always a treat. 
And, of course, you eat that way. And the Corps, we

12:08.195 --> 12:09.436
didn't. We weren't in the Corps. Where did you 
live? I lived in various dorms. My first dorm was

12:16.823 --> 12:19.585
dorm 16. Do they still call them by numbers over 
here? Yes, they go up to 12. No, not 16. It was 12. I

12:26.051 --> 12:27.272
must have been 12. I was in room 116. That's it. 
Okay. Number 16 came to mind. There was a dorm...

12:34.006 --> 12:36.088
numbered 16, I think, over here. In fact, what they 
used to call them by numbers over in the old... See,

12:36.128 --> 12:42.436
dorms very much like these are built in the 
Northgate area. In fact, they're built at the same

12:43.557 --> 12:45.940
time. Just west of...

12:46.380 --> 12:53.388
What's the big old Walton Hall? West of Walton, 
there's some dorms that are like the dorms in the

12:53.408 --> 12:57.813
core area. I think there was a dorm 16, 17, 18 over 
there. I'm not sure. Anyway, I lived first in dorm

13:03.014 --> 13:08.680
18, then I lived in dorm 7 and other various dorms 
over here. Then I lived in Walton Hall, G ramp, G1,

13:10.642 --> 13:17.690
Walton. And I remember very well those various 
rooms we lived in. My brother and I roomed

13:23.797 --> 13:25.078
together. We were a few brother-roommate 
roommates. pairs around. Most brothers broke up,

13:30.010 --> 13:33.534
but my brother and I were good friends and got along 
well. We're very nearly the same age, close

13:34.475 --> 13:36.618
enough. He's bigger than I am and makes us look the 
same age, although he's two years younger than I

13:36.638 --> 13:41.223
am. So, uh, and I enjoyed dorm life. I enjoyed 
knowing all the guys. But the dorm life wasn't

13:49.533 --> 13:52.737
quite the same as it is in the Corps. It was 
different in the sense that it was more informal,

13:52.997 --> 13:55.640
of course. We just, we had that weren't scheduled 
as tightly or scheduled as regularly as you are in

13:59.107 --> 14:09.602
your regular organized activities in the Corps. 
We lived among the Corps, though. Some of the dorms

14:10.964 --> 14:22.380
near us would be Corps dorms, and we were always 
aware that guys were falling out at certain times

14:10.964 --> 14:22.380
and bugles were blowing and things of that sort. 
But we never did respond to those bugles. We

14:25.630 --> 14:28.193
weren't required to, fortunately. But because 
your schedules were pretty demanding, as I

14:28.754 --> 14:34.780
remember, up early and busy, which is fine. And we 
were not unfamiliar with that sort of thing,

14:35.661 --> 14:41.307
having been in the Army, all of us, for some years. 
Knowing what it means to fall out at a certain time

14:42.689 --> 14:46.393
and do things on a regular basis. How did the 
community population, you know, the people, how

14:47.808 --> 14:54.916
did they treat people at A&M? Did they treat you as a 
veteran different from the poor? Or did they kind

15:01.164 --> 15:04.868
of look at you all as Aggies? My general, as I 
remember, we were all treated the same. I mean, if

15:08.092 --> 15:12.938
you were a student at A&M, it was pretty... For one 
thing, the population of the two towns... College

15:13.306 --> 15:21.977
Station Bryan, as far as just people that were in 
the town, was smaller than it is now by a long shot. I

15:22.037 --> 15:23.259
don't know how much smaller, really. I don't have a 
good estimate of that. I'm sure that can be looked

15:24.981 --> 15:26.223
up. But I distinctly remember that College 
Station was a very small community just around the

15:26.263 --> 15:35.174
campus, peripheral to the campus. And the people 
treated us all very politely, very, very well. I

15:40.762 --> 15:42.604
remember, for example, hitchhiking. was routine 
and comfortable and easy and safe and everybody

15:43.057 --> 15:48.722
felt okay about it. I don't think people do quite 
the same now. I mean, it's different now for

15:51.264 --> 15:53.546
various reasons. The big cities are bigger and 
they have bad reputations for people that do

15:53.586 --> 16:03.135
hitchhiking and there's lots of reasons why 
hitchhiking isn't a very good thing to do anymore.

16:03.675 --> 16:05.957
Whereas in those days, hitchhiking was routine. 
We had a place where we stood out there at the east

16:06.458 --> 16:12.523
gate and along there and we'd just get in line and 
then 20 minutes, even if the line was 40 or 50 people

16:12.740 --> 16:17.306
long, 20, 30 minutes, you'd be on your way. And 
nobody went upstream. That wasn't fair. You could

16:21.671 --> 16:27.037
go downstream, catch somebody who just thought 
about it a moment or something. But I used to get

16:27.057 --> 16:33.585
rides into Houston just routinely, you know, and 
never worry about it. I don't think I would

16:33.705 --> 16:36.349
recommend that for my son, you know. I don't know 
what you, do people still hitchhike very much? Not

16:40.229 --> 16:43.734
quite as much as they used to. Most everybody has a 
car. That's one big difference. In those days,

16:46.077 --> 16:48.181
most of us didn't have cars. I didn't own a car until 
I was, what, 26 years old, I guess. Whereas now,

16:53.048 --> 16:57.334
people tend to own cars a good deal younger, and 
it's normal. Then there would be less

16:57.594 --> 17:00.098
hitchhiking. In those days, there were very few 
cars on the campus, and some of the parking lots

17:00.138 --> 17:07.148
that are in the middle of the campus were just 
graveled. this lot 19 out here, right between us

17:07.432 --> 17:10.595
and Hart Hall, you know? Very central parking lot. 
That was a gravel, just a little gravel drive.

17:17.262 --> 17:22.728
There may be enough room to accommodate 30 or 40 
cars at most. Now it's all paved and curved, and I

17:23.469 --> 17:30.136
don't know how many cars it accommodates, but it's 
bigger than it was. So I remember, anyway. And, of

17:34.904 --> 17:40.529
course, we have lots and lots of parking space and 
still more parking problems, as you know. I'm sure

17:40.809 --> 17:44.012
we all do because of the construction. But in 
answer to your question, the people in town, both

17:44.032 --> 17:49.277
towns, I thought were very nice. And I don't think 
there was any distinction between the Corps and

17:49.797 --> 17:57.224
non-reg, what we call non-reg students. I guess we 
still call them non-regs. I don't know. Civilian

18:00.307 --> 18:02.329
students. And... I just remember that I was well 
treated, and I know the Corps was too, because

18:04.486 --> 18:12.620
everybody respected the Corps, and still does, of 
course, very highly. So, I remember that with

18:13.842 --> 18:18.089
pleasure and being very pleasant. Once you got, 
what'd you do right after you got your doctorate?

18:23.487 --> 18:30.955
When I first got my doctorate, I had been a 
consultant at what was then called the Humboldt

18:23.487 --> 18:30.955
Oil and Refining Company. I'm sure you remember 
when it was called Humboldt. It was only recently

18:33.117 --> 18:35.259
changed to the name Exxon. I was a consultant 
during my graduate school days at Rice with what's

18:36.461 --> 18:43.228
called the Humboldt Research Labs. It was called 
Production Research. And that was downtown

18:45.830 --> 18:49.915
Houston when I first started there. In fact, it was 
that way all the time I did consulting work and

18:54.149 --> 18:56.873
summer work for Humboldt. And then I stayed on that 
summer after I got my PhD and worked full time for

18:58.635 --> 19:05.325
Humboldt. But in the meantime I had arranged to 
come back to teach here. I talked to Dr. Potter and I

19:07.628 --> 19:14.077
talked about it and we agreed that there was a 
position for me here to teach. So I taught here for

19:15.699 --> 19:21.287
one calendar year in 1953

19:21.757 --> 19:30.248
through the August of 54, including the summer, 
September through August, September 53 through

19:21.757 --> 19:30.248
August of 54. So I was here one calendar year as an 
assistant professor, and I enjoyed that very

19:31.129 --> 19:36.536
much. I must say, in those days, I felt, see, I 
wasn't married still, and I was thinking

19:37.317 --> 19:50.835
that being unmarried and not being in a, community 
that there was an excess of men, not very many girls

19:51.220 --> 19:57.687
to meet.

20:00.089 --> 20:07.537
But I thought I should be in an area where there was 
more convenient social life and so forth.

20:07.878 --> 20:12.042
Ironically, it turns out, however, that I had met 
the girl that I did marry, finally. And she was a

20:12.603 --> 20:14.104
girl that I had met in Houston. And fortunately, I 
did marry. We did get married. But at that time, we

20:18.355 --> 20:20.717
hadn't planned to get married. What I did then was I 
had an opportunity to teach at the University of

20:21.978 --> 20:27.243
Missouri, Columbia, Missouri. And I thought it 
over, and I said, well, I probably should go ahead

20:29.004 --> 20:37.071
and take the opportunity to go to another part of 
the country. I had been away off and on anyway, as I

20:38.272 --> 20:42.176
mentioned. Like in the war, I was in Europe and New 
York and Colorado and California all around. And I

20:48.089 --> 20:55.559
enjoyed being in Texas, but I also enjoyed the 
opportunity to sample parts, other parts of the

20:48.089 --> 20:55.559
world. And going to the Midwest seemed 
attractive. And it was attractive. I went to the

20:59.924 --> 21:02.147
University of Missouri and taught there. I guess I 
taught there just eight years. And I

21:05.331 --> 21:10.438
enjoyed it very much. I got married soon after 
being up there, Joanne, my wife. I got married

21:16.286 --> 21:17.387
in... 1955, I

21:18.430 --> 21:29.848
guess, a year later in June of 55. And I was real, 
real young then. Although I wasn't real old

21:36.979 --> 21:40.184
either. So anyway, I was there first by myself and 
then my wife. We got married and my wife joined me

21:48.547 --> 21:50.150
there. She was there in Missouri. We were there. 
Our son was born in Columbia, Missouri. We have one

21:55.219 --> 21:59.106
son, David. I guess he was born in 1958. He's

22:01.450 --> 22:06.679
a native Missourian. then for reasons involving 
partly my interest, our interest in coming back to

22:08.363 --> 22:26.222
Texas and my pleasant memories of A&M and the fact 
that both my wife and I have family, our only family

22:08.363 --> 22:26.222
really, we both have very small families. Her 
parents died when she was fairly young. She has

22:29.105 --> 22:33.069
only one close relative, it's a sister in Houston. 
And it turns out my parents and brother were at that

22:33.089 --> 22:38.134
time my only close family were in Houston too. So we 
began to think in terms of the long-term future.

22:43.156 --> 22:53.388
Did we want to be in the Midwest indefinitely, or 
did we want to go back to an area like here and raise

22:43.156 --> 22:53.388
our family, which happened to be one son. That's 
the only child we ever had

22:53.408 --> 22:58.053
here. And we decided that coming back here would be 
better for everybody concerned, including other

22:58.333 --> 23:05.422
parts of our family. So we came back. And I was very 
lucky, luckily, an opportunity for me to come back

23:06.987 --> 23:13.635
here arose at the right time. Although I was 
planning to leave Missouri for two of the years and

23:14.696 --> 23:20.964
I even let them know about it. It was a very orderly 
resignation from Missouri. I had been promoted to

23:24.969 --> 23:28.513
associate professor there and all that sort of 
thing. I felt satisfied that I had performed well

23:29.354 --> 23:33.619
enough to to do anything I wanted to, go elsewhere. 
In those days, jobs for physicists were fairly

23:36.987 --> 23:47.619
easy to come by, especially if you'd done some 
research and had a reasonable reputation as a

23:36.987 --> 23:47.619
teacher. So I approached Dr. Potter and mentioned 
it to him maybe even a year before we finally made

23:48.500 --> 23:59.151
the move, or longer than that, I don't know, but we 
thought about it. And an opportunity did arise for

23:59.823 --> 24:04.169
me to come back, and I came back here in 1962. And 
I've been here, we have been here ever since. So

24:09.015 --> 24:23.434
the basic story, the framework of my story here is 
that I was here as a student in 1946, away for some

24:09.015 --> 24:23.434
years after 1948, and then back again in 53, 54. And 
during that time, things had changed a little bit.

24:26.771 --> 24:32.543
There was a burgeoning of research activities, 
which I noticed things had changed in that regard.

24:32.563 --> 24:38.715
The graduate program was really moving to bigger 
and better things. But my opportunity to go to

24:40.719 --> 24:44.106
Missouri was attractive. never have regretted 
doing that, but I'm always glad also to come back,

24:44.491 --> 24:48.957
that we came back. Now we've been here since 1952, 
which is what, 14 years? Almost 14 years, I guess.

24:59.390 --> 25:02.354
And I'm very, we're very pleased to be back. One 
thing, are we running close to the end of the tape?

25:05.799 --> 25:08.322
No, well, no, we still have a pretty good time. 
Okay, well, one thing that's, let's see, I was

25:08.362 --> 25:13.789
going to say, Oh, well, in addition to the 
attractiveness of A&M itself, as an academic

25:16.199 --> 25:35.268
community, which it always has been to me, this 
general area is attractive to anybody looking in

25:16.199 --> 25:35.268
from the outside. If you're in the Midwest and you 
don't realize it, if you're here all the time, but

25:35.328 --> 25:44.181
if you're away from here, you realize... that this 
part of the country is one of the most, well, it's

25:44.701 --> 25:50.489
sought after. It's known to be prosperous. It's 
known that the people are vigorous and active and

25:52.792 --> 25:57.478
lots is going on here. By here, I mean generally in 
the state of Texas and in particular in this part of

25:58.460 --> 26:05.890
the state of Texas. Let's say the south or maybe the 
south central and southeast part, Houston,

26:13.692 --> 26:18.918
Brown-Dallas axis, so to speak, or whatever, how 
you want to put it. So, and this part of the world is

26:18.938 --> 26:26.967
looked on in great glowing terms in other parts of 
the world, other parts of the country. And I was

26:28.469 --> 26:41.404
pleased to know that that was a place where I had 
been and I knew well, and people who visit here

26:28.469 --> 26:41.404
from, say, my university there at the University 
of Missouri would always come back and say, hey,

26:28.469 --> 26:41.404
that's really some place down there. And a lot of 
people I knew would come to A&M, and they'd come

26:41.992 --> 26:53.446
back with glowing terms about A&M, which always 
pleased me, because that's where I had been, and

26:41.992 --> 26:53.446
that was my home, my alma mater, and so forth. And 
you don't realize this until you get away from it,

26:53.466 --> 26:57.471
how highly thought of. We're all very proud of A&M, 
of course, but it's very nice to know that A&M looks

26:58.713 --> 27:06.362
good from a distance, too. which is something you 
always can be sure of unless you go to that distance

27:07.017 --> 27:15.089
and talk to people. And that was one of the things, 
that general prosperity, the general attitude of

27:15.109 --> 27:25.123
people in this part of the country, I thought was 
reassuring for the future. And I think that has

27:25.143 --> 27:29.729
been borne out as you see what's happening to A&M 
now. When we first came back to A&M, there were some

27:31.432 --> 27:35.758
frustrations, frankly. I remember distinctly 
having slightly different standards about such

27:36.802 --> 27:59.991
things as libraries, academic participation and 
student participation in governance, having

27:36.802 --> 27:59.991
faculty and student senates to speak up about 
certain things and have the regular

27:36.802 --> 27:59.991
opportunities to do so. And when I first came back 
to A&M in 1962,

28:05.810 --> 28:09.878
I guess, politically aware than I had been before. 
And some of the frustrations were, I thought, and I

28:11.060 --> 28:16.912
still think, well-founded. I'm saying 
frustrations in the sense that we had aspirations

28:17.813 --> 28:26.350
to be more active as a faculty

28:28.388 --> 28:39.848
And we had aspirations for the student body, as 
citizens of the community, to have an input to

28:28.388 --> 28:39.848
what's going on and what should be done. And as you 
know, we now have a very active, perhaps

28:39.868 --> 28:50.987
hyperactive, that depends on whose opinions you 
listen to, student senates and things of that

28:51.187 --> 29:01.077
sort, all sorts of student activities which 
involve making decisions and influencing

28:51.187 --> 29:01.077
decisions at policy level. And I believe in that 
sort of thing very strongly. I think that at least

29:05.021 --> 29:20.957
people should have their say and then have a 
regular way to say it, other than just to go around

29:05.021 --> 29:20.957
mumbling to each other and complaining to each 
other causes more trouble, I think, than to have

29:05.021 --> 29:20.957
open forums. and discussions with the 
administration and so forth. And we've made great

29:29.658 --> 29:31.521
progress in that regard. Mr. Rutter was a very good 
president in many ways. But in other ways, I think,

29:36.929 --> 29:42.878
frankly, that he wasn't the very good president of 
the university. It may have been that his way to

29:42.898 --> 29:49.307
lead us from one era to another was to be benevolent

29:50.249 --> 29:55.818
autocrat. He wasn't.
