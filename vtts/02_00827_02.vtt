WEBVTT

00:01.212 --> 00:05.597
I don't know what's really going on. I was 
listening one day when everybody's not black. I

00:07.979 --> 00:09.862
didn't know when they last. When they last. I was 
resting down in Alabama, Mississippi. I was here

00:14.066 --> 00:16.068
during King's Marches. And the last time I heard 
about it, I called her dad. He said, why in the hell

00:19.792 --> 00:21.975
aren't you going to deal with it? Well, see what 
happened right before that. Why in the hell? He

00:24.618 --> 00:26.680
said, why in the hell aren't you going to deal with 
it?

00:32.330 --> 00:35.155
This is a very nice town. It's not what it ought to 
be. But the potential is there. And we do have some

00:41.865 --> 00:47.554
fat-thinking folk in this town. Well, I guess in 
all times. I don't know who to talk to. Again, I'm

00:52.502 --> 00:55.487
going to talk to a lot of them. Let me ask you, you 
know, it's not like this area right here. It's

00:57.791 --> 00:58.692
all...

01:06.164 --> 01:08.566
That's the right word. And I think that's the 
answer to your problems.

01:16.313 --> 01:20.077
It was just like a fella called me one day and he read 
to me what I had written. Daniel and Son Funeral

01:20.137 --> 01:23.319
Home. Suddenly black folk. I stopped and said, no. 
No, he said designed to or something. I said, no, it

01:31.947 --> 01:34.990
was designed to serve anybody. It just worked out, 
you see. I mean, this is honest. I can bear it down. I

01:41.425 --> 01:46.392
could get another candidate just as good as 
Severson.

01:46.452 --> 01:46.793
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank 
you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:56.666 --> 01:57.648
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank 
you. Thank you. Thank you. A lot here. Three lots

02:05.226 --> 02:06.748
here cost me $55. Holy cow, if I got on 29th Street on 
one lot, it's going to cost me that. So now again,

02:11.855 --> 02:12.936
it's economic. It's keeping me from my family. Oh, 
if you want to go out there and buy, yes. That's what

02:16.922 --> 02:17.603
I'm talking about. I'm talking about that fuel. I 
got a teacher friend out there now. That's beside

02:22.589 --> 02:24.211
the point. I started to rebuild. I started to go out 
to East Park. But that's not East Park. It's all

02:31.220 --> 02:32.382
Negro. And if I want to go out there, there's going 
to be somebody that I'm not going to... That's why I

02:33.374 --> 02:38.720
say you're precious. There's going to be 
somebody, you know, that's going to be somebody

02:38.880 --> 02:47.169
that's going to be a star I'm going to be next to, 
maybe the same thing I went through tonight. I

02:47.229 --> 02:51.854
could be by my home next to one of you folk that's 
going to be just as special and not with the damn

02:47.229 --> 02:51.854
heat. See what I'm saying? So that's why I say, why 
don't you pay all those treasures every time?

02:58.261 --> 03:01.965
So I'm just as now, we sell... Have you noticed? 
I'll tell you what, let me give you another

03:01.986 --> 03:03.347
example. Went to a political meeting the other 
night. That was two, four, six slacks.

03:13.435 --> 03:16.098
The first two that went there was I went and another 
fella. We sat down. Here comes the two more. They

03:18.401 --> 03:19.663
came right where we were. Here come the... They 
came right by that four. See, I'm not mad at them.

03:25.310 --> 03:27.232
Then if you go somewhere, you're not bad by this. 
And there are four or five sitting right here. And I

03:30.095 --> 03:31.417
come and sit with y'all. That's all I'm going to 
say. That's all I'm going to say. That's why.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.507
Everybody wants to be clean, isn't it? Yeah. I 
listened the other day. Everybody said, uh, I had

03:40.209 --> 03:44.574
to have everybody in my mind. I thought about that. 
But, uh, seriously, when I'm sitting here, I

03:46.517 --> 03:53.425
like that. I don't talk about it. I don't think 
that's what he should have done. Because I'm going

03:55.648 --> 03:59.473
to have to break it down.

04:01.394 --> 04:05.540
And if you wouldn't, I don't like nothing. Unless 
you know me. Now, if you know me, you might come over

04:06.581 --> 04:08.725
and stay a few minutes. But you don't have to be that 
long. But if you're afraid, somebody might say,

04:12.710 --> 04:18.519
so-and-so, so-and-so, that is better, and 
so-and-so, and so-and-so. They might not put it

04:18.539 --> 04:21.222
that way, because nine times, I said it some other 
way, man. They might not say it that way to you,

04:21.242 --> 04:28.633
because seven times out of ten, you folks are going 
to have some money. Three times out of ten, that'd

04:28.765 --> 04:31.609
be one of us that'd brag a little. Am I right,

04:31.669 --> 04:35.895
little son? One of your folk told me I passed out one 
day. I was going on Main Street that night. Not that

04:42.685 --> 04:44.788
I wanted to drive a Cadillac, but I got a man. I've 
always used him to do this. One of your folk asked,

04:47.772 --> 04:49.114
who's that? That's that so-and-so. The man 
thought he was stupid. The man told me. And I know

04:54.822 --> 04:57.085
who he is, and I said, I think this is nice. I'd like 
to pick him up sometime on the path to me. I do. What

05:01.011 --> 05:10.861
I'm trying to say is sometimes we're forced to this 
thing or we're upset.

05:14.184 --> 05:18.329
But you're not going to think about it. Do you speak 
out against that? No. Not the potent child abuse.

05:29.971 --> 05:35.278
But I was even too young to really know the effects 
of it, feel the effects of it. I was too stupid, one

05:36.520 --> 05:37.982
of the two.

05:40.725 --> 05:45.452
But I happened to be, and I don't mean to say this 
braggadociously either, I was fortunate.

05:48.015 --> 05:52.081
Those men always had a few dollars. Always. I said, 
I don't say that braggadociously. I'm just

05:58.109 --> 05:59.691
thankful that he did. Consequently,

06:02.270 --> 06:13.362
whatever happened during that time, as far as I 
can, it just escaped me.

06:19.128 --> 06:22.552
Just like how she born in 54. She really stick out 
the mess. It was that. She even escaped the

06:29.827 --> 06:31.410
depression. Because don't think that the 
depression is hard on you folks. It was hard on us.

06:38.082 --> 06:39.344
No, it was hard on you all. Because we've been 
depressed. I'm not lying, so to speak. You folks

06:43.993 --> 06:50.164
can't even look at my back depression and say, 
we've been out of it. I'm so stiff.

06:56.955 --> 06:57.415
Let me get out of here. You're supposed to walk 
around and take a light potty. Then you'll get,

06:59.659 --> 07:00.840
cause I can't do it. Hey babe, remember we had it 
nowhere. I don't have one now. What about the

07:07.710 --> 07:11.055
weather? Let's talk about the weather. The 
weather? Yeah, has it always been such a new

07:13.177 --> 07:15.941
weather around here? Yes, it is all along. I 
remember the weather's been the same. Maybe yet

07:19.206 --> 07:20.708
it's time to get in the hut. Can you remember how 
many tornadoes or something at one time? Yes, I can

07:26.744 --> 07:28.285
remember one. And that happened a pretty long ago. 
I came off a film. I remember the other place where I

07:32.710 --> 07:34.471
was. My dad talked to me. He had a garage across the 
street. And I came in, driving, had something in

07:37.494 --> 07:39.216
the back. And I saw that light on the back when the 
door was open. I just thought, you know, lighten

07:41.398 --> 07:43.480
up. And look how hot it was going. Sure enough. And 
the last one. Because I knew while it was going, the

07:48.044 --> 07:50.847
wind was high and it rained like the dust. That's 
the only tornado. And I thought about this no

07:52.441 --> 07:54.763
longer than last night. What happened? Was it last 
night? Yes, last night. I thought about it at the

07:57.526 --> 08:00.289
same time. Because it was looking just about like 
it was yesterday. What about, somebody mentioned

08:03.953 --> 08:08.017
that, what is it, what was it, Navistad? It was 25 
miles wide or something. It had a flag. Was that

08:11.501 --> 08:12.462
years ago? That was 1900. Oh, 1900. Did you hear 
anything about that? I only heard about the

08:16.586 --> 08:18.808
braggers. Packers left his bank right here down 
Bridge Road the last few years. I went down to see

08:23.831 --> 08:30.419
it, and looking at the water, somebody said, 
that's true, look at it, you didn't see it. I didn't

08:30.439 --> 08:36.887
see it, I didn't see it, there wasn't that much 
water one time in life, especially around here.

08:36.907 --> 08:46.720
But our water's on, oh, it's about the same, very 
subtle, we haven't had any terrible, well, let me

08:36.907 --> 08:46.720
recall, when I'm from the communes, we don't have 
something like this, like a few trees, you know

08:36.907 --> 08:46.720
what I mean? Nothing no more than that that I can 
remember.

08:55.183 --> 08:59.029
What about, I asked you this earlier about the 
clothing you were wearing. Like when you were

08:59.109 --> 09:02.333
younger, I'm sure, what did the women wear? 
Laundry top? I don't remember again. I remember

09:05.357 --> 09:09.423
one thing, and that was back in 38. The men, I'm a 
young man now, they were wearing what is known as

09:09.443 --> 09:16.993
drapes. Daddy had what some people call them pigs. 
They're big up here and they're comfortable. You

09:22.694 --> 09:25.918
couldn't get none of the shoes on to save your neck. 
But my daddy never would buy me one. Never would.

09:30.684 --> 09:32.887
Back to kids at school, me, poor me. I dressed so 
bad. What do you mean by bad, Neil? You just didn't

09:37.273 --> 09:39.235
dress in the style? I didn't. My dad wouldn't buy 
it. And out of all the kids that were there, my dad

09:40.417 --> 09:42.800
had money to buy it. That's just that. But he always 
told me, you got plenty of time. Of course, I

09:45.900 --> 09:47.881
appreciate it today, but I didn't end with a damn. 
He said, you got plenty of time. You got plenty of

09:49.803 --> 09:50.364
time. I went to the movies like most of these kids 
did. I could almost run fast before I'd go to the

09:52.586 --> 09:54.367
movies. I used to sit in school, and I'd hear these 
fellas talk about a song hit radio. Boom, he said,

09:59.512 --> 10:02.034
that's so-and-so being played by so-and-so. I 
didn't know all that. But when I went to study in

10:06.799 --> 10:11.803
Westwood, I was getting my line from home. I'd been 
in certain of getting that little $106,000 slam. I

10:17.955 --> 10:19.517
was dressing like a fool. I was studying, though. 
Don't get me wrong. I got my show for that. I don't

10:24.283 --> 10:25.905
care for the record store. I could tell you who it 
was and what it was playing. I guess it was in me. So I

10:31.311 --> 10:34.976
don't remember the young men dressing at that 
time. I don't know what the ladies were doing, but I

10:36.558 --> 10:40.002
do know. what we were, what they were men. I wanted 
to serve them. Did you live in a, where did you live

10:45.620 --> 10:49.846
in New Orleans? 409 West 19, that's right from here 
on the corner, still there. My brother and his wife

10:53.791 --> 10:58.257
live in there now. 409 West 19.

11:01.722 --> 11:05.467
Do you remember anything about your neighbors, 
anything that was... They have all passed on, all

11:05.487 --> 11:10.073
those neighbors that were there during my time, I 
don't think it's the one living. I was a kid, that's

11:14.592 --> 11:18.237
where it began. Did your parents have a garden in 
the back? No. Did you buy all your food in the

11:21.683 --> 11:23.345
grocery store? Yeah, did they have, you know, 
like, big supermarkets like they do now? No, no,

11:27.772 --> 11:30.436
no, no. They didn't have all that. Most of you have 
food coming around. I'm saddened. I wish they'd do

11:34.842 --> 11:37.126
that today. Put it around the door and call them 
drummers. and stuff like that.

11:43.989 --> 11:49.957
You take my daddy, being a minister and a 
mortician, he didn't really have time for me. My

11:50.017 --> 11:56.365
mother, like I said, she was a school teacher, and 
then she actually put me in school, she started

11:50.017 --> 11:56.365
teaching music. Then for years she played music 
for that church there. So she wouldn't have had the

11:59.630 --> 12:02.634
time to with me. He or she wouldn't have had time for 
me at all.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.293
Do you think people that you said were drummers? 
Well, we called them a drummer. They'd come out,

12:11.896 --> 12:16.683
come out and be selling clothing, come out selling 
vests and so forth. We called them the day truck

12:16.703 --> 12:19.406
packers. On the wagon. What about the churches? 
You were talking about churches. Have you seen any

12:25.755 --> 12:28.720
changing, you know, changes in religion? Oh, 
yeah, yeah. In who? In what? In religion? No,

12:30.923 --> 12:33.246
religion doesn't change. Well, I mean, excuse me. 
But the folk, yeah, the folk used to go to church.

12:36.511 --> 12:37.452
They don't go to church no more. Not religion. Now, 
we all have a religion now. I'm talking about the

12:43.944 --> 12:46.307
one that we should be talking about. That one, that 
religion doesn't change.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.156
Now, we change. I've seen the time. We were talking 
about that yesterday. That church right there, we

12:56.162 --> 12:58.165
had a man by the name of U.S. Keeling. He passed a 
year ago. Well, it wasn't that church, the old

13:00.528 --> 13:01.730
church. If you want to get in that church, and it was 
a big one, bought from the first time the church...

13:07.402 --> 13:13.050
In fact, during this political meeting at 12 
o'clock at the Capitol table last Friday, I was

13:07.402 --> 13:13.050
talking to two or a couple of our friends. I was 
about to check on them. If you want to get a seat

13:14.492 --> 13:19.319
tonight, you've got to go two feet out of here 
tonight. That's a fact. That's a fact. You

13:21.081 --> 13:22.443
couldn't get nine-nine at all. Tonight, how can 
you do good and get thirty-four this night?

13:30.014 --> 13:31.175
Now, what it is, I don't know.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.324
But religion itself, it ain't going to get hard. I 
think we've got more to do. Well, not that we

13:41.363 --> 13:44.006
couldn't do it some other time. We've got a boat in 
the yard now, and we'd be ready to go on a trip, and

13:45.707 --> 13:50.832
we'd be going to Rance's Pass. Now,

13:52.754 --> 13:56.698
I did it once. That's something I didn't do. 29. We 
were going to Rance's Pass. In fact, we wanted to

14:03.464 --> 14:06.247
come go with him Saturday morning for a date. Now, 
he's coming today anyway. We left that Sunday

14:09.046 --> 14:18.844
morning area, and every time I pass a church going, 
I think I just, I don't know, just get me, because

14:09.046 --> 14:18.844
that's something I don't do. And I went on down 
there. I didn't catch a darn thing. In fact, I left

14:22.911 --> 14:25.375
carrying two boats, my boat and that. And I just 
went along to fish that Monday. I didn't get a bite.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.053
And the weather was bad. I don't know. I can say it's 
not so much the religion. The religion has

14:35.957 --> 14:36.517
changed. We have changed. See, at that time when 
everybody was going, we couldn't afford a boat. We

14:41.163 --> 14:44.446
couldn't afford nothing to pull it with, much less 
the boat. But now we've got two cars of chicken here

14:44.466 --> 14:50.433
parked. And I think that's what has changed. The 
good Lord has blessed us too much. Well, religion,

14:54.153 --> 14:58.677
did it used to play a big part in the family life? 
Yes. A lot more than it does today. Yeah, again,

15:02.321 --> 15:03.763
again, back to what I'm saying. We didn't have 
nothing but that. But now we can do what we want to

15:08.407 --> 15:09.989
do. We got a few dollars and go where we want to go, 
you know. Then, too, at that time, that's where all

15:12.311 --> 15:16.055
the girls were, too, you know. Oh, yes, girls, it's 
just, it's just not more so now, you know.

15:23.380 --> 15:28.827
Well,

15:23.380 --> 15:28.827
the activities haven't changed. They're the 
same. I went then because maybe I had to go, but it

15:32.513 --> 15:43.748
did something for me now that I go now and I don't 
have to go. I go now because I love to go. Yet I have

15:46.992 --> 15:50.417
this as much fun as those folks that don't go. I have 
fun when I'm there, and I have fun when I leave

15:51.578 --> 15:54.301
there. I say, I can get the robot out to the Lord, and 
I get as much fun Monday as I get Sunday, couldn't I?

16:01.389 --> 16:06.715
Well, you might say, well, that man has to work on 
Sunday, or on a Monday. Yes, then go Saturday. I

16:09.879 --> 16:12.562
think somewhere it says six days of that late, and 
do all that work.

16:16.066 --> 16:19.189
So it's like, it's changed what we're living with. 
This is skipping around now, but can you remember

16:19.287 --> 16:23.851
your grandparents? Oh, yes. Can you tell me 
anything that was outstanding about them that you

16:24.552 --> 16:29.437
can remember particularly well? I don't know how 
it would be outstanding, but I do know my

16:29.457 --> 16:35.062
grandfather was a terrible fellow. He was out the 
same house three times. I forget how many acres out

16:37.504 --> 16:38.946
there. And most of the folk, black folk, had moved 
to town, so my father... Talked him into setting

16:47.975 --> 16:56.126
out into LeBron, too, because had I known then as I 
know now, that acreage would have still been

16:47.975 --> 16:56.126
there, and I'd have had it. Because since that 
time, I acquired somebody in bed. I didn't, of

16:58.429 --> 17:00.391
course, the tent was only four miles out there. So 
he had him to move right here on

17:01.392 --> 17:08.001
Logan and 20th.

17:10.324 --> 17:13.448
They passed seven years back when my grandmother 
passed. I was living in New Pass. I was in

17:14.610 --> 17:15.631
Philadelphia. I didn't get to come to this room at 
all. But they sold out and came to Brown. She was a

17:24.153 --> 17:28.499
lovely person. He always talked about her. I don't 
know what that man called her. He said, you have

17:30.502 --> 17:33.606
more house. And he had a sister. You know, 
sometime, I think you all called the Black Sheep in

17:35.188 --> 17:37.772
the family. When he went to school, some folk told 
me my grandmother gave him the check. Now, he don't

17:45.442 --> 17:49.167
do that. My daddy said every time he'd run down, 
that's when he'd know about my poor hollow on the

17:50.513 --> 17:55.500
bicycle, I'd buy it. My stepson, I really want your 
dad, I'm not kidding.

18:03.751 --> 18:08.878
He'd tell me, he'd say, every time I run to buy a 
bicycle, my dad would buy me a brand new horse and

18:03.751 --> 18:08.878
bike. He wouldn't buy me nothing. But instead, 
when he went to my house, she'd give him a check, and

18:11.742 --> 18:18.731
she'd be talking about how he didn't run through 
with it. My daddy was different most of the time.

18:20.753 --> 18:22.997
And I think I kind of a little rubbed off on me. I'm 
not as different, but I got a lot of them. And my two

18:27.344 --> 18:28.505
brothers, they're doctors. I have two twin 
brothers down here. They're doctors. We get them

18:32.712 --> 18:34.375
checked with what we want to. They

18:34.395 --> 18:39.403
even sell the checkbook. Talking about 
checkbooks, do they always have banks? Can you

18:44.194 --> 18:45.335
remember? Well, as long as I can remember, they had 
banks. Was there any prejudice in the banking

18:48.918 --> 18:51.961
system at that time? Well, let's put it this way. 
There's still prejudice in the banking system at

18:53.042 --> 18:57.907
that time.

18:57.927 --> 19:01.450
Of course, they're getting better.

19:04.513 --> 19:09.998
And they're getting better now because several of 
them, one in particular, has got no organ. Then,

19:11.446 --> 19:15.291
too, the next growers have a little bit more money 
to ask for. They're going to have

19:15.511 --> 19:23.360
to kind of put their hand out and kind of talk about 
getting that dollar first. Oh, the dollar looks

19:23.520 --> 19:27.325
the same to get it paid. It is better if it pays to get 
it. It does get paid. You talking about borrowing

19:30.348 --> 19:31.410
money?

19:36.455 --> 19:37.757
It wouldn't be a better idea than that. back in 
1955. I was going to be able to turn home down there.

19:45.803 --> 19:51.712
A brown-bearded, long-headed man by the name of 
Ernest Langford. He was a Hellcat till the day he

19:51.732 --> 19:54.175
died. He is in Hell now, looking up, hoping 
somebody comes to him with his tongue. And anybody

19:59.183 --> 20:02.388
that's present means, yeah, they can't get away 
with it. Because if they hit him, I don't want to go.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.792
If he's hit him, I don't want to go. That's a fact. He 
met my wife one day.

20:13.431 --> 20:16.215
But anyway, I wanted to borrow money. Well, after I 
came out of service, I wanted to be in their house.

20:21.802 --> 20:25.307
And on paper, the house wasn't close enough. But I 
had a house down at, he told me at the time, that was

20:27.169 --> 20:31.555
in

20:35.348 --> 20:35.930
1956. Boy, I was living in 507 West 19th Street with 
my father. I'd married then. Boy, You go find

20:49.017 --> 20:51.981
something called $3,000 I'll talk with you. I 
said, hell. I said, what do you mean something like

20:52.762 --> 20:54.625
$3,000? I said, that's where I am. That's where I 
live. And I said, man, I'm kind of mean. That's more

21:00.914 --> 21:05.000
than the one that I was talking about. And I said, I 
grabbed my mean stick from him because my daddy was

21:05.020 --> 21:09.967
the most easy to try to get us off. Unless you made 
him hard. Back in the day, the man would break

21:13.823 --> 21:26.500
through the cars, and he always said, like, you

21:13.823 --> 21:26.500
better not do that. That's all he said. Because he 
had one of that boys. You better not do that. With

21:32.348 --> 21:32.528
me? Well, his map is the best, of course. His map is 
the best. I went to a business meeting with him one

21:35.492 --> 21:37.354
night, and I thought for a reason. Yeah, I only 
heard about two of them. They're getting a good map

21:38.556 --> 21:40.479
back in Lincoln, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
That's right. One of the old deacons got up. The

21:44.307 --> 21:47.652
pastor wanted us to send him to the National 
Baptist Convention. He said, brother, older, he

21:47.673 --> 21:58.812
said the National Baptist Convention meeting in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, I'm going. That's

21:58.832 --> 22:03.440
what he said to me tonight. But see, I'd have at 
least wrapped my ear in something. You know what,

22:05.503 --> 22:06.645
though, really? It would be nice if more folk like 
you would get the message across. It would be

22:10.894 --> 22:14.179
better than any edict that the Congress will ever 
pass. Because don't fool yourself. That's some

22:17.344 --> 22:20.068
good black folk. Then there are some that are worth 
a damn. And that's some good white folk. I'm going

22:25.716 --> 22:26.878
to give you an example of that.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.982
over me. No, I said, I'm against so-and-so, so I'll 
be out of credit. And I said, why? And they said,

22:48.088 --> 22:49.410
excuse me. I don't know, man. I just got mad. What 
the? Oh, this preacher. I talk about that every

22:55.799 --> 22:57.882
day. I can't go for that kind of stuff. Because 
sometimes, or some people, and some people too, I

23:01.347 --> 23:07.997
don't want to open it. But not only because he's an 
equal, not because he's not. And that's what I

23:10.581 --> 23:11.482
said. The preacher can take

23:16.370 --> 23:29.185
I

23:16.370 --> 23:29.185
went

23:16.370 --> 23:29.185
out there. That's the scone of the other guy, I tell 
you now. Had she not been there, I wouldn't have

23:36.474 --> 23:38.556
gone. But then after I started letting them come, I 
became involved. Now I tell you another thing, I'm

23:42.160 --> 23:43.542
fighting. Since we got Brian High here, I'm 
waiting to see now when they're going to finally

23:44.855 --> 23:50.602
find a Negro that's going to come speak to 
Baccalaureate Summit. You see, now I'm sure some

23:52.384 --> 23:56.189
of you folks can tell us something, and some of my 
folks can tell y'all something. I just mentioned a

23:56.209 --> 23:57.871
good one, Barbara Judge. Out of all the professors 
you got at A&M, I think she'll stand toe-to-toe

23:58.572 --> 24:03.138
with whoever. Thanks for two people together. 
Because when you find one of us that has excelled or

24:04.880 --> 24:12.149
does excel, don't fool yourself. You've got to 
excel sometimes. And she's one of them. You hear

24:17.426 --> 24:22.873
me?

24:22.893 --> 24:29.803
See, I like to tell the whole group of black people 
about this same thing. And that's what's going to

24:30.003 --> 24:31.505
get the same spread. For black people. Because 
you're going to be more involved than... the lady

24:39.209 --> 24:43.536
here, because she hasn't really been identified 
with it. You've been involved in it. But you

24:47.082 --> 24:59.181
haven't been involved to the extent where if you 
and another white fellow is coming up the road

24:47.082 --> 24:59.181
there, and one of us is going to walk and kick me, and 
then you see me whooping, you're going to turn in

24:47.082 --> 24:59.181
and help him. You're going to turn in and help him. 
I'll whoop both of y'all in before you try to

25:00.223 --> 25:02.787
polish. It's kind of like I had two friends fight 
one day. Hang on. I had two friends fight one day,

25:06.882 --> 25:10.809
and I'm a friend of this one, I'm a friend of this 
one. One of them said, which one are you going to

25:10.829 --> 25:13.594
punch? And I thought about it. It wasn't. Just 
punch. So instead of you punching, you're going to

25:16.038 --> 25:18.042
have to take side. That tells me how far you've come 
out of where you were. Would you take side, or would

25:23.091 --> 25:24.955
you just punch? Punch. Let's talk about food. We 
haven't talked about food. Is the food still the

25:32.429 --> 25:33.970
same? No, it's not the same. I am so hungry. No, it's 
not the same. It's not the same. I think we've

25:37.774 --> 25:41.117
doctored it too much. We don't get the same value 
from it we used to. Not only have we doctored it,

25:44.281 --> 25:49.105
we're cooking it different. Well, what was 
different? What can you remember when you were a

25:49.926 --> 25:52.649
little kid that you ate? Well, I eat the same thing 
now, but like I say, it's been... Fertilizer death

25:56.075 --> 25:58.860
and growing too fast. We just don't get from it what 
we used to get. Then we've gotten these type of

26:01.626 --> 26:05.534
cooking utensils. We've gotten to put all the good 
stuff out in the drain, you know. What we throw in

26:08.159 --> 26:09.742
our drain, we should be eating. And that's what we 
keep. We should be throwing in our drain. Well,

26:11.425 --> 26:12.207
what is this? Well, I see that salt food. What is 
that? Who's that? Salt food. Salt food. Salt. Oh,

26:18.316 --> 26:20.699
that's just a common vernacular. They give the 
stuff like greens and, well, I must be able to call

26:20.719 --> 26:26.286
it greens, chitlins and that kind of mess. They 
call it soul. There's nothing soul about it. Yeah.

26:30.290 --> 26:34.335
That's just a name they gave to food like that, soul 
food. To me, it's nothing. To me, it's like that

26:36.738 --> 26:39.722
dunce thing right on, and I'm just sick of it.

26:45.609 --> 26:47.130
That's just common vernacular. That's all. 
Nothing's soul food. If I like steak, to me, that's

26:50.431 --> 26:52.814
soul food.

26:55.658 --> 26:59.243
If you like baked beans and mustard beans, that's 
all right. That's soul food, too. Is that what you

27:00.244 --> 27:03.348
want to call it? Were there any, like, good 
restaurants that you've gone to? Outstanding

27:09.156 --> 27:11.500
places? Outstanding? No. We still don't have any. 
Wow. Well... Now, I think the closest thing to, I

27:12.581 --> 27:17.668
understand, I went out to... The tower, the food 
was very good. Now, I might say that's

27:22.412 --> 27:25.536
outstanding, but I'm putting that in the class of 
Seth. It's going to take another, once we get

27:27.277 --> 27:38.069
Piccadilly in here to weigh it wider, then we're 
going to have a good

27:27.277 --> 27:38.069
restaurant. Tell us about some of the food you had 
when you were back. I ate the same thing then. I ate

27:41.593 --> 27:43.214
the same thing then. I'm eating now. Ten right 
there. I'll tell you one thing, every Sunday, my

27:46.623 --> 27:54.030
dad would call them short seven steaks, every 
Sunday. And I went out to cut for my grandmother,

27:55.831 --> 28:04.519
she said, you're going to have a chicken every 
Sunday. But the food's about the same. We can't eat

28:07.562 --> 28:10.184
as much as we used to because it's so high. I told my 
wife yesterday, she had, for dinner now, I had a

28:10.204 --> 28:14.368
strip salad. I think I had supper last night. Strip 
salon. That's fine. I said, you can't do strip

28:23.040 --> 28:24.842
salon. Really. We had strip salon Saturday. I went 
for dinner yesterday. She had to go to school

28:31.090 --> 28:32.912
because she came home with her. I had strip salon 
again last night. So food hasn't changed since the

28:34.214 --> 28:36.116
price has gone up. And one thing about food, like 
she said, she said, I'm working. I'm eating a

28:38.719 --> 28:39.280
little. Let's get through. And I can't much blame 
her, but I don't see that. We've done that, though.

28:46.580 --> 28:47.441
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, what about, do you remember 
that building of Highway 6? No, I can't remember

28:51.164 --> 28:56.069
the building of Highway 6 now.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.553
I don't remember when it was. I don't know whether I 
remember that or what. I can't recall.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.980
What about, have you heard of Peach Creek? Yes, 
I've heard of Peach Creek. I don't know where that

29:12.323 --> 29:14.005
is, but I've heard of Peach Creek.

29:18.389 --> 29:19.591
I don't know what it is. We just talked about it in 
class, you know, somebody mentioned Peach Creek.

29:23.176 --> 29:24.758
Well, I've heard of Peach Creek all right. I just 
don't know what to mention. I don't know. I've

29:29.024 --> 29:31.587
heard of Peach Creek.

29:39.177 --> 29:40.239
What about the railroad? Can you think of 
anything? Yeah. I asked you that before, but...

29:43.904 --> 29:44.785
The railroad, uh...

29:48.140 --> 29:49.862
I can't think what year it was, man. What did you 
call that thing? The Zephyr. That song was just a

29:54.669 --> 29:58.034
smooth ride in the car. And the first day to come 
through here, everybody came through at

29:58.054 --> 30:05.585
10-something and 12-something, I believe. 
10-something going to Dallas, 12-something

30:05.605 --> 30:09.170
going to Houston. And the first day it was to come 
through was like a raid up there, man. That big, you

30:12.615 --> 30:16.020
came through, just flashed all his brakes, set out 
like a car. It was a pretty thing. Fast. Was

30:22.515 --> 30:23.997
everybody standing there watching? Oh, yes. They 
were there.

30:29.363 --> 30:36.953
They talked about Amtrak, but Amtrak can't be 
might of good if you're

30:29.363 --> 30:36.953
equal as that. Let's talk at A&M. Let's talk at 
Brown, A&M, and A&M. And I don't think it stopped

30:42.967 --> 30:46.250
between. I don't think it did. I don't understand. 
I don't understand.

30:54.758 --> 30:56.961
You folk out there got a wonderful opportunity. 
Let me ask you a question.

31:01.805 --> 31:07.171
We had a very large house, but it was heated with 
wood. We had out back what we called a wood house.

31:10.523 --> 31:13.087
That was my job at school, make sure that wood was 
in. We heated with wood, cooked with wood.

31:19.135 --> 31:21.118
The restroom was outdoors at that time. I can't 
remember when we got electricity, but I know

31:22.420 --> 31:32.835
eventually when I can remember, we had

31:22.420 --> 31:32.835
it. We bought television the day they came out, 
that they got the bribe. We both tell

31:39.110 --> 31:42.976
them. I'm going to tell you a story about that. Oh, 
Kraft, he won't tell anyone tonight because I've

31:46.281 --> 31:50.006
been mad. And Kraft had closed. So I called up, 
Daddy, we closed. What do you want? I said, I want to

31:56.396 --> 31:58.839
tell you. He said, oh, hell, they went and closed.
