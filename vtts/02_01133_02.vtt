WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:07.287
Cynthia says that the only way George will go is if 
we're going, because he doesn't like to travel.

00:09.168 --> 00:10.490
And we enjoy being with one another. It's very 
comfortable. And

00:11.571 --> 00:25.103
so we made, I would say, a half a dozen trips 
together to China and Yugoslavia, through Italy,

00:11.571 --> 00:25.103
France. And we generally rent a car together, or 
two cars, whatever the case may be. And we have a lot

00:30.541 --> 00:31.803
of adventures. And of course, in the process, we 
get into a town, I check out the restaurants. And I

00:36.692 --> 00:40.097
have an instinct for it. That's a good quality to 
have. I took a walk through town. I found a place

00:45.727 --> 00:49.774
around the corner that I think would be perfect. 
And we haven't had too many bad meals that way. I can

00:52.699 --> 00:56.245
tell by the menu, by the ambience. Sometimes I can 
go in and talk to the proprietor, his shed looks

00:56.545 --> 01:02.053
clean and all, whatever the case may be. So I'm his 
restaurant grazer. That's good. And we've had a

01:06.218 --> 01:08.462
lot of interest. We went all through Sicily 
together. And I realized maybe that wasn't a good

01:11.145 --> 01:20.879
choice, because taking George Mitchell with his 
wealth to Sicily is what the band has got us. And on

01:20.899 --> 01:24.324
the other hand, nothing happened. No problem. No 
problem at all. But at any rate, the Woodlands was

01:26.532 --> 01:31.757
full of excitement to me. I saw it as an aesthetic 
accomplishment as well as a practical

01:31.837 --> 01:41.066
accomplishment about providing good living, 
good environment for families. So as George went

01:41.807 --> 01:46.291
along, he would share his dream with me every step 
of the way. Not that he saw my advice or some things I

01:46.692 --> 01:55.020
can't help with, you know, real estate matters and 
all that, but when he talked about having a

01:46.692 --> 01:55.020
research center and when he talked about Park, and 
we talked about that, he would park those ideas to

01:55.304 --> 02:07.462
me just as a means of, I guess, using a council or a 
friend as a backboard, you know, and talk about it.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.306
And his ideas were always exciting and 
far-reaching. I never thought he would do the

02:10.386 --> 02:13.851
thing. No, I knew he would do what he did in terms of 
Park, but his ambitions were so far-reaching What

02:22.304 --> 02:26.290
do you see as the distinctive or unusual qualities 
of the Way? It's more than this new community idea

02:26.310 --> 02:32.118
presented in that book, it seems to me. What is 
special? What's special about this place? I don't

02:35.784 --> 02:42.073
think people, most people appreciate the fact 
that this is wonderful living. Freedom from

02:45.541 --> 02:49.146
Social insecurity, like we see in the big city. I 
live in Chicago. You have to be very careful

02:50.628 --> 02:53.172
walking down certain streets at night. Chicago 
less so than New York or Los Angeles. So you have

02:57.658 --> 02:59.080
that. You have a perfect environment for 
children, I think. It's a beautiful place to live.

03:06.331 --> 03:07.953
The buys are fantastic. The values are fantastic. 
You have a man who is sincerely devoted provided

03:15.173 --> 03:17.437
the best environment there is in the country. It's 
like going into a restaurant, you've got the

03:18.478 --> 03:21.403
proprietor you can talk to. And there's a direct 
communication in a way to George Mitchell,

03:21.443 --> 03:29.195
because he's patrolling the place all the time. 
It's his baby. He's very interested in

03:30.898 --> 03:32.961
everything. And to me it's so incredible that 
George is so detail-minded. I think I'm that way

03:38.810 --> 03:40.032
too. But George, he's He'll drive down some 
street, and if you see something wrong, he'll

03:42.342 --> 03:47.810
attend to it or call somebody. He's on the premise. 
He's not a remote entrepreneur. So his very heart

03:51.916 --> 03:54.219
and spirit are in this place. What about the 
research component in the Woodlands? Is that

04:01.930 --> 04:06.336
something relatively new, or did you sense that 
that was developing early on also? In other words,

04:06.817 --> 04:10.662
the integrated economic community seems to be... 
Well, I have a feeling that I didn't quite

04:11.468 --> 04:18.438
appreciate it at the start, because I didn't 
realize how far he was going to go with it. I knew

04:19.118 --> 04:28.511
what it was, and I knew it would be an important 
component here, because I was familiar with the

04:19.118 --> 04:28.511
gold triangle down at Duke, and I knew what they 
did. And I was once called on to lecture there, and I

04:30.013 --> 04:35.801
got a little better penetration than most 
outsiders. But I think he's done something that's

04:36.703 --> 04:40.007
so remarkable. It's fraught with problems. The 
problem is essentially that George is such a

04:41.992 --> 04:52.045
benevolent benefactor and that people feel, 
well, if they need money, George can do it. That's

04:52.786 --> 05:06.124
really the big problem there, that it's so closely 
identified with the Woodlands and George

04:52.786 --> 05:06.124
Mitchell that the community takes the position, 
well, we really don't have to help it too much

04:52.786 --> 05:06.124
because it's George's baby and he can give the 
money. And George continues to help them

05:06.164 --> 05:09.488
financially. But on the other hand, he wants them 
to get themselves free from him, not because of the

05:10.177 --> 05:25.354
money, because he thinks it's good for their 
long-range future and thinks the community will

05:10.177 --> 05:25.354
embrace it. Now, whether the community will ever 
do it adequately, because it's in the woodlands,

05:26.095 --> 05:32.162
is a question. You also have a series of 
universities, each of which has their own destiny

05:39.978 --> 05:41.881
in mind. They favor Park. On the other hand, 
they're mostly concerned about their own

05:44.906 --> 05:49.153
identification. And I can see that. In a way, 
they're in competition with each other. But they

05:55.202 --> 05:58.728
don't realize. I want to be very careful what I say, 
if it's a matter of record, not to cause any

05:59.709 --> 06:04.858
problems for George and his relationship. No, I 
don't care. I'll be very careful. Early in my

06:08.378 --> 06:16.007
relationship with the Hertz Enterprise, and I 
worked on this, I realized something very

06:08.378 --> 06:16.007
important. The licensees, some of the licensees 
were very upset that they had to handle referrals,

06:17.128 --> 06:27.541
calls for the rental of a car for other licensees. 
You're living in Milwaukee. You call the guy and

06:30.925 --> 06:34.950
you say, I need a car in Chicago tomorrow. And he has 
to communicate with Chicago. Some short-sighted

06:38.146 --> 06:42.510
licensees would say, hell, I don't get anything 
out of that. Why should I give them any special

06:42.950 --> 06:44.772
attention? Yet, the reason those licensees grew 
and prospered, became so enormous, was the Hertz

06:45.553 --> 06:53.300
program grew enormously. They were able to 
attract a big subsidy advertising program from

06:53.680 --> 06:59.465
major car manufacturers. They were advertised to 
such an extent that the guy in Milwaukee began to

06:59.485 --> 07:04.470
prosper. He got a lot of business out of this 
cooperative effort. Yet early in the game, he

07:07.306 --> 07:09.108
resisted it. That's a pain in the ass for me to work 
on their problems. I don't get anything out of it. I

07:14.794 --> 07:19.539
keep the clerk busy all the time handling 
referrals to Miami, for example. So I think the

07:20.580 --> 07:23.464
same thing applies here. There has to be a 
tremendous amount of work by all the universities

07:23.984 --> 07:35.777
to make HAARC grow and become very important, as a 
result of which HAARC's umbrella will bring more

07:23.984 --> 07:35.777
research grants to the universities. At least 
that's my assessment. That's a difficult job.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.857
Universities are very jealous of each other. 
Yeah, well, I sensed that. I ran a seminar

07:43.203 --> 07:49.614
yesterday where we had 16 people there, the heads 
of each of the disciplines. And we talked about

07:49.634 --> 07:53.501
what the objectives were, what the problems were. 
These were representatives from the

07:54.042 --> 07:55.965
universities? Yes. And it was a five-hour 
seminar. And when I got through, I was totally

08:01.778 --> 08:04.842
exhausted. I flopped in bed because I was on for 
five hours. And it wasn't that I was talking for

08:08.847 --> 08:10.949
five hours. I was dealing with each one. There was 
confrontation a little bit. It was friendly. An

08:17.057 --> 08:19.220
exchange of ideas between these people. A lot of 
the universities are very parochial. They're

08:22.183 --> 08:23.445
very provincial. It's like nothing exists 
outside of your borders. Yeah. And I sensed that

08:26.489 --> 08:29.052
here and there in that room. And they sense a great 
deal of power within themselves. A&M does, and

08:34.263 --> 08:35.744
Texas does, of course. Well, I'm sure, you know, I 
remember I reminded myself of that McGraw-Hill ad

08:35.845 --> 08:51.404
where the guy's trying to sell something, and the 
executive's sitting in the chair and says, I don't

08:35.845 --> 08:51.404
know what you want, I don't know what you have to 
sell, I don't want any of it, you know? That's it. In

08:52.285 --> 08:56.170
a way, talking before that academic audience 
there yesterday, I wondered if it was there. I

08:58.293 --> 09:07.325
didn't sense it after a while, because I have some 
experience in warming up the audience and getting

08:58.293 --> 09:07.325
them to at least listen to me. I don't know if they 
trusted me. But when it was all over, they all stood

09:08.947 --> 09:12.411
up and applauded. I guess that means something, I 
don't know. It certainly does. It certainly does,

09:15.135 --> 09:16.497
but they probably wouldn't. Maybe it's Texas 
politeness. If they just sat there and applauded,

09:21.040 --> 09:24.544
I would agree. Well, they wanted to leave. But one 
guy actually said, well, this is very

09:27.989 --> 09:32.514
interesting. He said, but you didn't tell us 
anything we don't know. Well, I know what I did,

09:36.259 --> 09:40.083
that I got them all to think together. There were a 
number of people in the room who didn't know

09:40.464 --> 09:44.689
everything that they thought they knew. And a 
number of people were very excited to ask me if I'd

09:44.869 --> 09:49.495
come back. But one professional said, well, you 
didn't tell me anything I didn't know. Well,

09:53.967 --> 09:56.229
that's happened to me a half a dozen times in my 
life. People have said that to me. And I'm always

09:58.031 --> 09:58.971
amused. Because I don't know anything that they 
don't know. It's just that what I do is package it.

10:05.738 --> 10:07.220
And I put a discipline to it. So anyway, along the 
lines, George and I have, I guess we've dreamed

10:07.240 --> 10:16.328
together. And he exchanges ideas with me. And 
sometimes I will then say, well, I think we ought to

10:19.478 --> 10:27.629
do this or that in terms of the communication 
factor to carry the message out. Are we going to

10:27.849 --> 10:29.972
have a press conference? Are we going to do this or 
that? I would say for the last 10 or 15 years, I

10:32.356 --> 10:40.547
haven't really been heavily involved in the 
account, in the nuts and bolts of the account. I'm a

10:40.567 --> 10:43.351
consultant, essentially. And I'm an idea 
generator. I'm a counsel. I'm an advice giver.

10:49.617 --> 10:57.427
What I do is unearth dramatic ideas from the stuff 
they already have, ways of presenting them. And

10:57.707 --> 11:03.334
when I thought of Noguchi I knew that would bring 
all kinds of people here. I wish we had it. You know

11:04.716 --> 11:10.863
how much that Noguchi playground would be worth 
today as a piece of art? I have no idea but I'm sure a

11:10.883 --> 11:12.165
lot. probably ten, twenty million dollars, you 
know, and just a piece. You took the components

11:18.234 --> 11:20.837
out, you could sell them. I recently saw a fountain 
at the Pompidou Museum in Paris. It would be

11:25.883 --> 11:33.472
perfect for the woodlands, and I took all kinds of 
pictures and sent them to George, and George tells

11:25.883 --> 11:33.472
me, he's translating them now and giving them to 
his designers. Whether he'll ever do it or not, it

11:33.752 --> 11:42.102
may be too expensive, but it's a fountain that has, 
a large fountain that has revolving pieces of art.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.679
in the style of, you know Ricky St. Paul, have you 
ever seen him work? No. You know the Michelin

11:46.860 --> 11:51.585
figure with the pumped up balloon? Well she does 
figures like that. And she did some figures that

11:55.209 --> 12:00.695
are revolving in this fountain. They're kind of 
childlike large blown up figures. And I think that

12:05.480 --> 12:07.182
would be a tremendous joy. But you know, a lot of 
these ideas that I developed are beyond budget.

12:11.913 --> 12:14.637
The Woodlands isn't making a lot of money, which it 
isn't. Can't spend that kind of money yet, but they

12:15.458 --> 12:18.863
will someday, some of those things. So I keep 
looking at things. Why does George Mitchell do

12:20.965 --> 12:23.509
this? I interviewed him and tried to ask basically 
the same question. I'm not sure I got an answer.

12:29.898 --> 12:30.739
What does he do what? Why does he do the Woodlands? 
What is it? What's the motivation? To build a city?

12:36.667 --> 12:37.789
Because he... He just likes to do things. You know, 
I'm really trying to understand the individual.

12:44.052 --> 12:45.493
This is his creative monument. The other is a 
business, you know. Yeah, this is not a business.

12:49.979 --> 12:54.924
No, it's a creative monument to George, to a man's 
vision to build what he considers a perfect city.

12:55.445 --> 13:02.673
And George has rationalized that the urban 
communities really are in the state of decay.

13:02.693 --> 13:03.374
Yeah, right. He said that. You go around the 
country and see all these communities. You go to

13:07.013 --> 13:11.379
Hammond, Indiana, or Gary, Indiana, or 
Indianapolis. Even Chicago itself has a terrible

13:12.020 --> 13:18.349
problem with its downtown and is spending a lot of 
money trying to revive it. Living conditions are

13:19.551 --> 13:23.036
such that it's very difficult for people. Cost of 
homes, all that kind of crime, schooling, all that

13:23.877 --> 13:28.063
kind. Is there anything comparable to this in your 
travels and experiences that you would really

13:28.083 --> 13:33.171
relate or correlate? Well, the one that's built 
Baltimore. It's called Reston. It's said to be

13:39.548 --> 13:43.614
capital, but I haven't seen it. You mean Columbia? 
You mean Columbia you're talking about? Yeah,

13:49.323 --> 13:49.643
Columbia. It's the name of the company that built 
it, Reston. Yeah, Reston built it. The community

13:53.148 --> 13:55.071
is called Columbia. I haven't seen it, but I 
understand it's nothing like this. It's a planned

13:58.075 --> 14:00.799
community that's successful. George has 
developed the most successful village of this

14:00.819 --> 14:05.927
sort that was sponsored by the government. It was a 
hug. The only one that really survived. And it will

14:12.366 --> 14:13.247
survive. And luckily, George had an energy 
company that could help subsidize it as it went

14:13.287 --> 14:21.077
through the maturation period. And George, there 
are some people who are naysayers. Members of his

14:26.343 --> 14:29.087
own board said, George, you're nuts. What are you 
doing this for? Energy companies making all these

14:31.189 --> 14:34.193
profits, and you're pouring it into this thing. 
Well, I think someday probably Mitchell Energy

14:35.067 --> 14:42.135
will spin off either Mitchell Energy or the 
Woodlands. And the Woodlands is going to be worth a

14:42.776 --> 14:46.881
fortune, a tremendous fortune. This is a piece of 
property. I don't know what it's carrying. So you

14:50.625 --> 14:52.287
think it's really coming into its own. It's in the 
developmental stage, too, basically. Yes. Well,

14:56.532 --> 14:58.654
there are 28,000 people living there now. And when 
I tell people that George acquired 85,000 acres,

15:04.328 --> 15:07.091
in ten years in eight hundred different 
transactions. I'm not sure of the exact figures,

15:07.531 --> 15:09.914
but that's my recollection. Oh, it's your clock, I 
think. Yeah, and the way he did his persistence,

15:11.135 --> 15:24.989
his dogged persistence in getting this done and 
pulling it together and hiring Roy Ferreira, you

15:11.135 --> 15:24.989
know, for the landscaping and all that, the 
terrain, and great architects. And I'm just

15:25.970 --> 15:29.914
amazed that he that he can do so many things at one 
time, remember them, give attention to detail.

15:35.543 --> 15:38.147
You know, I go to the Mardi Gras down in Galveston. I 
go in almost every year except one, I guess. And he

15:41.050 --> 15:47.359
patrols the streets and he sees the exhibits are 
right, and you know, all kinds of things. You know,

15:47.459 --> 15:54.028
we've interviewed some twenty people in the 
Woodlands, and three or four times now, during our

15:47.459 --> 15:54.028
interview, the phone rang and George Mitchell was 
on the phone to talk to this individual, who had no

15:54.582 --> 16:02.012
direct relationship at all, I wouldn't have 
thought. But that was a good indicator in my mind of

16:02.993 --> 16:07.279
the close contact. Well, he remembers almost 
everything you ever said to him or anything

16:07.299 --> 16:11.825
anybody else has ever said to him. He still finds 
time to give attention to his children. He still

16:16.331 --> 16:19.155
finds time to play tennis every day. He plays a damn 
good game of tennis. You ever seen him play? No, I

16:22.437 --> 16:23.418
haven't, but I've heard. He's as good as they can. 
At his age, I would say he's a top-ranked tennis

16:25.421 --> 16:29.205
player. He's a great outdoorsman. He loves to fish 
and hunt and all that kind of stuff. Our greatest

16:35.172 --> 16:39.316
fun has been as he's turned me into an outdoorsman. 
I'm a city dweller. I don't know how to fish. He's

16:43.461 --> 16:44.582
taught me how to fish. He puts the shrimp on my hook, 
and he throws it in the water, and I pull it in, and he

16:47.637 --> 16:51.385
takes it off. He calls me the great white hunter. I 
used to go out to Cook's Ranch to get some deer once

16:54.211 --> 16:59.001
in a while. And I'm rated as blind by the Air Force. I 
was given a certified disability discharge at the

17:01.667 --> 17:06.858
base of my bad eyesight. And when I fire, a deer 
drops. And I'm convinced they hang the deer up. And

17:13.283 --> 17:14.485
when I fire, they drop it. I've never missed. And my 
wife and I are in the blind there, and I'm ready to

17:18.010 --> 17:20.474
shoot. She said, don't shoot. That's such a 
beautiful deer. And the deer drops when you don't.

17:26.964 --> 17:30.570
Once I fired, and I almost cried because the deer 
ran off. And I said, oh, I may have wounded it. And

17:32.633 --> 17:34.116
the ranger said, what happened? Did you go into the 
wood after him? I said, I went as far as I could go.

17:38.026 --> 17:39.568
Well, they were very worried about it. Because you 
never miss a shot. And I said, no, I missed that one.

17:43.615 --> 17:46.740
The next day we went in deep in the woods and the deer 
had run in and died. Is that right? Yeah. That's the

17:50.305 --> 17:51.727
only one I missed, I thought. Because we lost the 
meat. We lost the animal. We destroyed an animal,

17:54.992 --> 17:56.875
unfortunately. And I've been wild turkey 
shooting. Oh, I once went... white goose hunting

18:03.473 --> 18:08.802
with George, you know, in the southwest or 
somewhere. Yeah, so he's given me that part of his

18:08.822 --> 18:13.088
life, which I appreciate. An insight into him, we 
went, we lay out crab pots in the bay, and we went out

18:14.411 --> 18:24.707
one night about four o'clock when I first arrived, 
and we put out these crab pots. We got out about a

18:24.727 --> 18:27.692
half mile, and the motor conked out. Now, I said to 
George, we'll both get in the water and we'll pull

18:28.972 --> 18:34.639
the boat in, because it's only six feet there or 
something like that. He said, oh no, I'll do it. You

18:36.421 --> 18:38.103
stay in the boat. So if you're going to visualize 
the picture, George has a rope around his neck. I'm

18:42.188 --> 18:43.370
in the boat with one oar. All we have is one oar. And 
I'm a half-assed singer, and I'm singing all the

18:45.012 --> 18:52.140
Russian

18:45.012 --> 18:52.140
songs. That's a memorable picture. George pulls 
the boat in for about a It took us about three

18:56.292 --> 18:59.177
quarters of an hour to get to shore. He's in the 
water pulling it. And the mosquitoes, he had a

19:01.781 --> 19:03.384
better deal. The mosquitoes were biting me. 
That's probably why he got in the water. He knew

19:07.090 --> 19:07.991
what he was doing. When I got to shore, I almost 
passed out. I was so bitten. But it was a funny

19:12.178 --> 19:20.832
sight, this processional of this great tycoon 
pulling at the rope, and I'm in there. If there is a,

19:21.537 --> 19:35.614
what do you think the public perception is of the 
Woodlands, or should be, if it is, in other words,

19:21.537 --> 19:35.614
where this meeting is in terms of what people 
believe it to be and what it is, is that pretty well

19:21.537 --> 19:35.614
now in conjunction?

19:38.337 --> 19:47.528
Well, I think people in Houston, for example, 
which is, the Houston area is their best market,

19:38.337 --> 19:47.528
are beginning to appreciate I say, I don't know 
what the percentage is, but I say there's an

19:48.672 --> 20:00.470
increased perception, increased appreciation 
of the woodlands, as far as I can tell by talking to

19:48.672 --> 20:00.470
people that I meet from this area. I come in here and 
I have friends here. At the start it used to be

20:02.813 --> 20:08.802
considered Mitchell's Folly, you know, who's 
going to move out there? But now these things that

20:09.663 --> 20:12.047
are occurring, this Expressway that's coming 
here. What's the name of the expressway? Hard Toll

20:15.344 --> 20:16.466
Road. Hard Toll Road, you know, which makes it so 
easy to get out here. The transportation system.

20:21.995 --> 20:24.419
The pavilion is a stroke of genius, you know. 
There's a lot of people who come out here who never

20:24.799 --> 20:29.066
visited this place before. So I would say there's 
an increased perception, which was hampered

20:30.649 --> 20:36.718
somewhat by the economic environment. I'd say it 
wouldn't be further along. And yet, all during

20:39.550 --> 20:50.601
this past three or four years, they've done very 
well, as I understand it, on a comparative basis

20:39.550 --> 20:50.601
with what some of the real estate has done. And 
there's everything here you could want. Now, as

20:52.243 --> 21:02.754
more and more things are added here, the school 
system and other things, and more jobs, and the

20:52.243 --> 21:02.754
scientists out here, there'll be more people who 
want to live out here. So I think it's going to be an

21:04.776 --> 21:08.460
enormously successful place. And then, of 
course, when the homeowners feel that they own

21:08.879 --> 21:22.692
their villages and exercise more care in the 
preservation of those villages and the

21:08.879 --> 21:22.692
maintenance. Do you think those people will be 
able to sustain the woodland's aura or character

21:23.153 --> 21:33.343
once, in other words, in this weaning process? 
There is a tension, apparently. Well, it would be

21:35.345 --> 21:37.227
to their advantage to do so. It certainly would 
now. I've been through a similar situation. I once

21:41.147 --> 21:45.532
did a consulting job for a place called the 
Nichols. There's a village, a cluster of villages

21:47.153 --> 21:54.101
that's similar, run by the J.C. Nichols Company 
out of Kansas City. They were the developers of the

21:54.141 --> 21:58.205
original shopping center. First major drive-in 
shopping center in the country. And it's still a

22:01.649 --> 22:07.675
big and viable economic real estate empire. And 
what happened was, as the villages, each of these

22:08.178 --> 22:22.010
clusters took over ownership, proprietary 
ownership of their villages, they wanted to make

22:08.178 --> 22:22.010
certain changes, which distressed the J.C. 
Nichols Company. And they began to agitate for

22:22.711 --> 22:24.392
things. There are problems that occur when those 
clusters take over ownership in terms of what they

22:24.893 --> 22:37.864
want to do, what they don't want to do, and what 
their attitude is toward the major benefactor,

22:24.893 --> 22:37.864
which is the Woodlands Corporation. I can 
anticipate all kinds of things happening in the

22:38.030 --> 22:41.133
future. But nothing that's injurious or will 
cause anything to happen here that will limit this

22:41.474 --> 22:49.202
place. And little by little, George is adding 
exciting elements here. To be able to have the PGA

22:52.205 --> 22:56.269
here, which is fantastic. And to have Frank 
Sinatra sing here, which is incredible. Were you

23:00.073 --> 23:01.474
out here for that opening? No, no. No, we've heard 
about it. He gave an incredible concert. He's a man

23:04.998 --> 23:06.940
that's not in his prime anymore. But he's a great 
showman. All kinds of things happening here. So by

23:12.073 --> 23:17.979
starting my life all over, I would be living down 
here, no question about it, because everything

23:12.073 --> 23:17.979
that's here I love. What I don't see is a good place 
to eat yet. And I don't see movie theaters that are

23:23.445 --> 23:28.109
as convenient as I like them. Ultimately, there 
has to be something more of a cultural nature with

23:30.272 --> 23:35.357
people, legitimate maybe a repertory group here 
or something like that, but that will come. How

23:39.045 --> 23:42.289
about university-type complexes or 
educational? Terribly important, sure, because

23:42.349 --> 23:56.525
if you had a university out here and you can 
participate in the cultural life of the

23:42.349 --> 23:56.525
university and mix with some of those people who 
are living here, it makes it a fuller life. I spent a

23:59.008 --> 24:03.353
lot of time in Palm Springs, and I wouldn't spend 
the time there if it weren't for the fact We have a

24:03.620 --> 24:11.830
cultural center, and we have legitimate plays 
come in, and the symphonies, visiting

24:03.620 --> 24:11.830
symphonies, and all kinds of movie theaters if you 
want to go. But I think that's going to come. And I

24:16.255 --> 24:19.018
know George will see it in his lifetime. It's going 
to take another 25 years, I would say, for the kind

24:19.619 --> 24:24.965
of maturation that I'm talking about. Yeah, I've 
heard that number used quite a lot. I see. It's a

24:27.948 --> 24:28.970
long-range picture. But look what they've got 
already. That's right. Incredible. One of the

24:32.240 --> 24:37.885
problems of the woodlands, I've addressed it a 
number of times, and I keep working on things over

24:32.240 --> 24:37.885
the years. If I agitate enough, ultimately 
somebody does something about it, because they

24:38.606 --> 24:44.231
get tired of hearing me talk about it. When you 
drive into the woodlands, you don't see the

24:44.751 --> 24:49.135
woodlands. You start on the expressway drive in, 
and you say, what the hell is this? It's a lot of

24:52.799 --> 24:53.519
trees. And you see there's a name identification. 
And you say, well, do I want to see Grogan's Mill or

24:58.384 --> 25:00.766
whatever it is? I don't know what it is. Where's the 
pavilion? How do I find it? And all that stuff. So

25:04.954 --> 25:10.663
I've been pushing for kind of a map, a picture map, 
like Life magazine. You open it up, and there'd be a

25:10.683 --> 25:18.596
corollary number on a post, which is number one, 
and the map shows you what's behind the tree. Yeah,

25:18.616 --> 25:19.657
a walking tour. A walking tour of the place. See, 
now, they've gone so far as they're doing a picture

25:21.080 --> 25:24.365
book now. But that isn't what I have in mind. Maybe 
the picture book will suffice. People can get

25:28.131 --> 25:28.892
around. But I want a numbered walking tour or auto 
tour of this place. When you're able to look at it,

25:35.192 --> 25:41.538
if you're just to cut off the, go through the top and 
see this place, it's incredible what's here. But I

25:42.859 --> 25:45.921
see the gorgeous homes here that people are able to 
get. Of course, it's a double-edged sword, too.

25:47.263 --> 25:56.711
One of the things that I sense some of the 
residents, you know, we were talking earlier

25:47.263 --> 25:56.711
about whether the local associations will pick up 
the gauntlet and continue. I see them as actually,

25:56.771 --> 25:59.233
in some ways, jealous of the good things about the 
Woodlands, maybe even the Woodlands Corporation

25:59.568 --> 26:06.816
has been. Because they've really bought into the 
ideas here. That's why they're here. But I've

26:11.141 --> 26:16.527
lived here since 73 and have driven down to Houston 
all the time. And frankly, the Woodlands, as you

26:16.607 --> 26:22.233
said, was to me a wall of trees on the right side of 
I-45 as you drove down. And it had no meaning

26:23.154 --> 26:24.816
whatsoever. But at the same token, were I living 
here, You know, there's some mixed feelings

26:30.753 --> 26:44.695
about, do I want a walking tour where individuals, 
you know, from elsewhere, you know, where the

26:30.753 --> 26:44.695
woodlands becomes a tourist kind of event for its 
continued growth. You live here now? No. Oh, you

26:46.337 --> 26:47.279
did live here? No. College Station. College 
Station is where I'm from. I live up here in

26:50.043 --> 26:51.485
Coliseum. Well, you know, it's the same problem 
we're dealing with, the universities versus

26:51.966 --> 26:55.832
Harkin. If the people who live in the woodlands 
realize that if this community grows, they'll get

26:56.015 --> 27:05.067
more things here, they'll get that movie theater 
right in here. They'll get the shopping centers

27:05.247 --> 27:07.170
and all that. So you have to take a long view of the 
welfare. And my feeling is that if more people came

27:11.296 --> 27:16.703
and saw this place, more people would want to come 
and live here. It's that simple. I've always, I

27:18.445 --> 27:22.731
like the title, I guess, The Machine in the Garden. 
And I see that as one of the possible tensions of the

27:23.099 --> 27:26.563
future in the woodlands. Too much development. Of 
course, the kind of development they're trying to

27:29.426 --> 27:35.012
do is trying to tone that down a little bit. Too much 
business, if you will, that might disturb the

27:35.192 --> 27:43.521
garden aspects of the woodlands as one of the 
futures. They don't want any infringement on

27:43.541 --> 27:45.884
their privacy. No, that's right. Can you have it 
both? Can you have progress and can you have

27:47.826 --> 27:49.528
progress? Look, I live in condominiums in Chicago 
and in Palm Springs. And there's some things I have

27:56.221 --> 28:00.305
to do as kind of a social enterprise. I have to do as 
an owner of a condominium apartment or home. I've

28:05.010 --> 28:06.131
got to live with my neighbors. I don't like the fact 
that the pool is filled with children on holidays.

28:11.136 --> 28:15.060
I don't like the fact the neighbor across the 
street has a dog that barks once in a while. or

28:15.513 --> 28:23.184
there's another neighbor who's visited by a 
relative with a recreational vehicle, and it's

28:15.513 --> 28:23.184
parked in the street, some things I don't like. If 
they're against the condominium rules, I protest

28:24.106 --> 28:28.152
it and get it stopped. But if it's just a violation 
of what I consider my privacy, I either have to live

28:28.893 --> 28:34.181
with it or I have to move. And the same thing here. If 
you're living here, if you want the place to offer

28:36.284 --> 28:41.892
you all the good things you want in life, You have to 
participate in the growth of this community and

28:42.665 --> 28:48.150
the recognition of this community. I think that's 
the key. And apparently the Woodlands has done a

28:48.990 --> 28:55.036
good job, I think, of organizing such that there is 
participation. Well, the infrastructure

28:55.056 --> 28:56.297
itself. The infrastructure itself is a 
conservative instrument. It maintains, well,

28:59.420 --> 29:03.003
the natural environment. That's a sacrosanct. 
Yes, sure. In fact, they're moving. Bill

29:08.167 --> 29:11.490
Kendrick, who's responsible for the grounds 
here, One thing to ask myself is, is there, in fact,

29:11.740 --> 29:16.505
a set of rules, regulations? Has the things which 
you have developed been codified? And he says, no,

29:19.048 --> 29:21.051
but we're going to do that. He says, we've arrived 
at the point where we can do that. And I think that

29:24.495 --> 29:37.950
infrastructure is what's going to preserve the 
integrity of the ruins, for want of a better term,

29:24.495 --> 29:37.950
through the stages of growth.

29:39.078 --> 29:44.385
I think it's an exciting project, and it's true to 
its principles. And as long as George stays alive,

29:44.405 --> 29:47.048
it'll be true. He's got a son on the board now, and 
his son probably will carry on those principles

29:47.068 --> 29:54.758
for the years. And George, of course, has always 
maintained control over the corporation, so

29:54.838 --> 30:00.105
nobody can take it away from him. Not from the 
standpoint of preserving his wealth so much, but

30:00.866 --> 30:06.773
preserving his control. You know, we talk about 
proxy fights and all that. Can't do that with

30:09.598 --> 30:11.841
Mitchell Energy, you know. What the hell is he is 
when a guy owns more than 60% of the company? And,

30:16.406 --> 30:23.194
you know, you talk to George about wealth, he never 
is concerned about his own wealth. I've never

30:23.214 --> 30:25.517
heard him talk along those lines. God, I just lost 
$2 million today or something like that. He

30:29.262 --> 30:30.864
doesn't do that like most executives. That's an 
abstraction to him. It's a benchmark when he has to

30:32.886 --> 30:36.270
look at it. What he's mostly concerned is going 
ahead with his dreams. And that includes, of

30:40.760 --> 30:44.224
course, the enormous job. Have you looked at 
Galveston recently, what he's done there? Yeah, I

30:46.767 --> 30:48.228
spent a lot of time there. Yeah. Well, it's 
enormous what they've done. Each year I come down,

30:51.252 --> 30:54.616
there's something new. The restaurant across the 
way, I forget the name of it. God, you can't get in

30:57.920 --> 30:59.281
the place. And that Irish pub, can't get in the 
place. his vision and building, you know,

31:05.056 --> 31:07.899
bringing the Mardi Gras back. Yeah, that worked. 
Yeah, great idea.

31:14.968 --> 31:18.712
I guess the other arena that I am concerned with 
here is the art. I keep pushing the concept of

31:19.012 --> 31:34.050
having more art for aesthetic appreciation and 
also ultimately it should be an artistic

31:19.012 --> 31:34.050
adventure to come out here, you know, just to look 
at these. famous sculpture. One of the best things

31:35.401 --> 31:40.606
he has here was done by a friend of mine that George 
and I visited in Rome. We went to his studio and

31:40.866 --> 31:43.889
George commissioned. It was Robert Cook. I don't 
know if you've seen his piece. Which one is it? It's

31:48.333 --> 31:51.316
the one where the young man stands on the shoulder. 
It's a beautiful piece. I have a big collection of

31:55.280 --> 31:57.883
that man. George saw it when he was with me. Next 
thing I knew he commissioned it. I didn't even know

32:02.767 --> 32:03.328
it. until it was erected here. And he sprung a 
surprise on me. He had Bob Cook do it. It's a lovely

32:08.784 --> 32:10.265
piece. I think it's the best pleat piece of the 
woodlands, frankly. You ought to have more pieces

32:13.028 --> 32:19.054
like that, that are a fine piece of art, that are 
expressive. And I feel that there ought to be a

32:19.074 --> 32:26.362
universal, consistent theme of the collection of 
art. See, if I were starting fresh, I would have

32:27.043 --> 32:30.987
nothing but Southwestern art here. by great 
Southwestern artists and sculptors. At this

32:36.048 --> 32:39.412
point, I feel that the collection is kind of 
random. Somebody saw something, and they bought

32:39.633 --> 32:42.196
it, and they like it. It's a little apocalyptic. 
Yeah. I really feel that what I would have started

32:46.541 --> 32:54.371
with either Southwestern artists or great 
American artists, but this would lend itself to

32:46.541 --> 32:54.371
Southwestern artists. Or a lot of Mexican art, 
Zuniga's and people like that.

33:01.139 --> 33:05.624
I used to go to the University out there to see those 
murals. I've not seen those. Fantastic, yeah.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.533
There will be ultimately stuff here like that. I 
would certainly enhance the quality and the

33:14.674 --> 33:19.940
appeal of the literature. Well, I think we've 
pretty well covered the... My God. What time did we

33:26.247 --> 33:27.769
start? Well, about 9. An hour and a half. Well, 
that's pretty good. Well, this is a big treat for me

33:31.193 --> 33:37.110
to have somebody listen to me. Who wants to listen 
to me for half an hour? I'd like to know more about

33:40.098 --> 33:45.895
your public relations business and some 
interviews.
