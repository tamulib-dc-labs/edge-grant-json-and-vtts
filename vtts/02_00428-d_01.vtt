WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:04.479
Okay. The battalion commander, at the time I got 
there, I'd heard a report on the radio, you know,

00:04.499 --> 00:32.518
that that platoon was in trouble, and by the time I 
caught up with that brigade commander, the

00:04.499 --> 00:32.518
battalion commander, they were convinced that 
they'd been captured, both the battalion

00:04.499 --> 00:32.518
commander and the brigade commander, and they 
asked authority to pursue across the border to

00:33.680 --> 00:34.421
recover them.

00:38.785 --> 00:42.789
And I said, it's just not, no, you know, you can't do 
that. But I told them also that I just couldn't

00:45.131 --> 00:56.021
believe, I couldn't reason, that any platoon of 
troopers in that division would surrender. To me,

00:57.683 --> 00:58.944
it was out of the question. There must be something 
else. Well, sure enough, they were, of course,

01:04.190 --> 01:27.733
something of an emotional state and I had full 
sympathy with them but here's one of those

01:04.190 --> 01:27.733
examples where they thought that just yonder a 
matter of hundreds of yards the enemy had their

01:04.190 --> 01:27.733
troops in captivity had been captured and taken 
away and we couldn't go get them that's how strict

01:04.190 --> 01:27.733
that policy was but anyway we did discover

01:33.704 --> 01:34.465
Not one. One man survived. One man who played dead 
survived. And they just walked into the trap. Even

01:43.115 --> 01:52.567
had their, the normal, you know, security at work, 
but it just, they were just too close formation.

01:53.167 --> 01:53.588
They got them. But

01:54.989 --> 02:02.138
I've had many people ask me, why couldn't we win 
that war? Yeah. Why couldn't we destroy that

02:04.045 --> 02:08.049
enemy? Well, let's take what I've just described, 
this division. There were a number of them who

02:14.195 --> 02:23.204
really had everything back in the sanctuary 
except the troops he sent out to assemble for a

02:14.195 --> 02:23.204
fight. It's just like standing behind a wall and 
sticking the point of your spear through at

02:30.961 --> 02:33.444
somebody. You can cut his spear off, head off, but 
he can draw back and put a new one on. You can't get to

02:40.232 --> 02:43.896
him through that wall, and that's exactly the way 
it was. Or another, anybody

02:44.777 --> 02:56.631
that's raising gardens like I am,

02:57.421 --> 03:01.546
and has a problem with rabbits and rats, how does he 
get rid of them? He's surely not going to get rid of

03:01.566 --> 03:05.470
them by killing them in his garden, you know. But 
here we were with absolutely no authority to go

03:06.732 --> 03:25.453
across that border, and we had 600 miles plus of 
border that offered sanctuary to enemy troops,

03:06.732 --> 03:25.453
installations, and that very, very vital line of 
supply.

03:29.281 --> 03:45.326
And any way you look at it, with an enemy who knew, 
and they had a very smart, very, very brilliant

03:29.281 --> 03:45.326
strategist in this, you know, Gap, you know, who 
was running this war. And they never, and I came to

03:47.069 --> 03:56.183
resolve this in my own mind, they never intended to 
put more into South Vietnam than they could afford

03:47.069 --> 03:56.183
to lose. And they would continue to put what they 
could afford to lose indefinitely. And the

04:03.293 --> 04:07.479
strategy all along was, of course, to wear us out. 
Sure. On the other hand, it seems to be the only way.

04:12.727 --> 04:18.715
And of course, having experienced this and 
looking back on it, it's a lot clearer now than it

04:12.727 --> 04:18.715
was at the time. At the end of the first year, I 
didn't see how that enemy could continue to lose

04:18.756 --> 04:25.866
those people at the rate we were seeing them lost. 
and continue the war. By the end of the next six

04:29.433 --> 04:33.440
months, that was pretty, you know, becoming 
pretty clear. He was sending in what he could

04:34.442 --> 04:38.749
afford to lose and that was it and he could go 
indefinitely. So, we had to change or it was

04:38.769 --> 04:42.276
inevitable. It seems to me that we'd have to quit. 
Change in what ways?

04:51.692 --> 04:52.393
Basically, I felt that in the 1966 and 1967, well, 
what we had to do is change to an objective, a

04:53.048 --> 05:08.145
purpose that would conclude the war in our favor. 
And clearly we had to get out of the boundaries of

05:08.966 --> 05:11.548
South Vietnam. We had to get out with ground troops 
as well as air power and naval power. And that was

05:18.316 --> 05:22.060
the basic change that would have had to occur. Now, 
who can, however, to turn the coin over, who can

05:22.715 --> 05:45.870
criticize President Johnson, who had the final 
responsibility for this thing, from concluding

05:22.715 --> 05:45.870
that he could not, he must avoid at all costs, he 
must avoid getting the Chinese in that war.

05:56.448 --> 06:12.305
President Johnson, I feel sure, must have had in 
the back of his mind that he

05:56.448 --> 06:12.305
had to limit that war to whatever extent was 
required to prevent the Chinese, to obviate the

05:56.448 --> 06:12.305
Chinese coming in. Again, in retrospect, and I 
must say that there was some thought given to it at

06:13.847 --> 06:24.278
the time in the circles that I brainstormed with. 
You'll recall that in 1966

06:24.832 --> 06:38.308
and 1967, the Chinese were in the greatest 
disarray since they took over China in 1949. The

06:38.328 --> 06:40.791
Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution. I 
really think we could have gotten by with a great

06:43.594 --> 06:49.662
deal without bringing them into that war. But the 
thing is, either enter the thing with the plan and

06:55.510 --> 07:00.037
the strategy and the determination to win it or 
don't get in it. And I don't think we'll do that

07:02.861 --> 07:04.624
again. I don't think we'll go in again without a 
strategy to win. The strategy used is credited to

07:11.214 --> 07:17.563
Secretary of Defense McNamara. It was called the 
strategy of graduated response. And I don't think

07:23.337 --> 07:40.080
we're going to have to wait two generations for 
historians to record it clearly as a stupid,

07:23.337 --> 07:40.080
unreasoned, inappropriate strategy for war. And 
we were at war.

07:47.770 --> 07:49.032
Why do you say that? Why do you say it was stupid? 
Well, the strategy was if the enemy hits you, you

07:51.957 --> 07:58.366
hit him back just a little harder. So, if he hits 
back a little harder, you hit him just a little

08:00.189 --> 08:03.434
harder more. Well, that's quite a departure from 
Sherman's old busties with the mosties, but what

08:05.076 --> 08:18.235
it does is violate the very clearly established 
principle of war of mass.

08:20.122 --> 08:28.009
if you're going to engage the enemy, engage him 
with sufficient mass to overpower him at the

08:20.122 --> 08:28.009
earliest possible time. In fact,

08:29.871 --> 08:46.367
those two principles of war, the objective and 
mass, were the two most violated in Vietnam that

08:29.871 --> 08:46.367
assured lack of success,

08:29.871 --> 08:46.367
in my opinion. In other words, you would blame the 
loss of Vietnam on the civilians? No. No, I didn't

08:55.757 --> 08:56.638
say that. Well, you were talking about McNamara 
and Johnson. No, I was talking about the fact I was

09:02.086 --> 09:17.187
referring to President Johnson's final 
responsibility,

09:02.086 --> 09:17.187
which presumably he had concluded that he wanted 
to be sure and avoid the Chinese. Yeah. And

09:19.167 --> 09:35.149
so, therefore, we went in on what's called, of 
course, a limited war, but without any real plan

09:19.167 --> 09:35.149
for winning it. And the strategy really is 
attributed to that strategy of graduated

09:35.770 --> 09:42.760
response, limited war. It was attributed to 
McNamara. No, I think if you... rather than say

09:48.108 --> 10:17.203
blame the civilians, I think that just as much 
blame, if not more, should go on our Joint Chiefs of

09:48.108 --> 10:17.203
Staff and senior commanders who didn't, should 
have had, of course, the sounder knowledge of what

09:48.108 --> 10:17.203
was required there and didn't sell it, didn't sell 
a better solution.

10:22.313 --> 10:27.678
I think there's enough blame to go around, and I'm 
not discussing this to fix the blame, but I was

10:22.313 --> 10:27.678
trying to. And again, in hindsight, all of this 
comes much more clearly, and the only benefit that

10:29.380 --> 10:45.736
we're going to gain from studying this war and 
finding where the failures were is to learn from

10:29.380 --> 10:45.736
it. Sure. Well, what's your opinion of Robert 
McNamara? I think Mr. McNamara, of course, I never

10:50.950 --> 11:02.809
knew him personally, and I was always looking at 
him at considerable range, but obviously he was a

10:50.950 --> 11:02.809
brilliant man. He had a great mentality, in other 
words. He was a great organizer. Unfortunately,

11:15.318 --> 11:21.466
in such detail that he had the Department of 
Defense doing what two echelons below should have

11:15.318 --> 11:21.466
been doing.

11:23.749 --> 11:24.450
Great energy. And he certainly had the strength of 
his convictions. And he certainly could put them

11:30.258 --> 11:36.306
across to his president. But I think that we, I 
hope, have learned that...

11:46.047 --> 11:51.795
He over-organized the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense. He exercised more decision on pure

11:51.815 --> 11:57.822
military matters than any civilian should 
undertake.

12:00.826 --> 12:02.729
And in doing so, of course, he dominated. He

12:02.849 --> 12:10.960
was very dominant in his goal.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.882
And in my opinion, He certainly should be given 
credit for his intelligence and his dedication

12:14.549 --> 12:32.528
and his effort, but he certainly also is to be 
criticized for, I think,

12:14.549 --> 12:32.528
hindering as much as he helped,

12:14.549 --> 12:32.528
if not more. Hindering in what way? Making all 
those decisions? When the field commander should

12:36.211 --> 12:38.474
have done that? We talked about 20 years to the 
field.

12:43.658 --> 13:07.201
the Lance Missile, twenty years to field the

12:43.658 --> 13:07.201
computer system, fire direction system for the 
Army, the strategy of graduated response, the

12:43.658 --> 13:07.201
overall organization of the Defense Department 
requiring the processing and staffing and

12:43.658 --> 13:07.201
decision making there that should be made echelon 
below, and that's what I'm talking about. Okay.

13:10.745 --> 13:11.826
When you were After you returned from Vietnam, did 
you ever get, I don't know if you remember, did you

13:12.127 --> 13:26.482
ever get a survey from another Brigadier General 
or a man who was a Brigadier General later in the war

13:12.127 --> 13:26.482
named Douglas Kennard? I did. I got a letter from 
him asking me to contribute by commenting on

13:27.503 --> 13:40.617
Commander General Westmoreland and various 
things, and I never participated. Why not? Oh, I

13:43.700 --> 13:48.365
didn't think that, I didn't know really what his 
purpose was in the first place. And I felt if I were

13:50.928 --> 13:57.136
going to contribute to something like that, I 
ought to do it myself. And I didn't think I had a lot

13:57.156 --> 13:59.178
to contribute. I mean, after all, I was never in a 
position of tremendous responsibility. I was not

14:08.870 --> 14:12.694
tested in the highest jobs.

14:14.378 --> 14:18.662
To me, I put it in the same category of criticizing 
your commander when you don't actually do. You

14:18.682 --> 14:19.643
don't think you ought to do that. That's what he was 
looking for, was criticism. If you got a balanced

14:22.846 --> 14:32.256
view from me about General Westmoreland, and I've 
said some things about General Westmoreland

14:22.846 --> 14:32.256
here, I'd have to put it in perspective. And he 
would, I presume, expect that perspective to show

14:34.118 --> 14:39.183
weaknesses as well as strengths. Well, as I said 
earlier, I don't think General Westmoreland

14:43.420 --> 14:52.453
weaknesses showed through if you discount the 
fact that he didn't challenge his mission. Well, I

14:53.955 --> 14:57.701
was just wondering because Kenner did write a book 
entitled The War Managers. I haven't read that.

15:01.246 --> 15:11.761
Which is two-thirds of the generals, there were 
about 160 generals in Vietnam during the time and

15:01.246 --> 15:11.761
two-thirds of them did respond to that survey and 
then he put it together in a book and I was just

15:01.246 --> 15:11.761
wondering. Have you read the book? Yeah. Was it 
good? I thought it was very interesting. I'd like

15:16.369 --> 15:32.268
to read it, but the reason I didn't participate was 
I just, if I'd known him well, if General Kennard,

15:16.369 --> 15:32.268
my former commander, had asked for that 
information, knowing him, I would have given it to

15:16.369 --> 15:32.268
him. I would have given him my opinion. Now you were 
in, when you were in Vietnam, you were made general

15:33.849 --> 15:39.516
officer, brigadier general. in August of 1966. 
What were your feelings when you found out about

15:42.231 --> 15:44.574
that? Well, I was very surprised, really, and 
gratified, of course.

16:00.194 --> 16:01.776
And I was delighted. You see, when I was nominated, 
I was asked to come up with General Kennard to be

16:02.397 --> 16:08.845
Assistant Division Commander immediately as 
Colonel. So I was a Colonel, Assistant Division

16:09.652 --> 16:20.926
Commander, until they promoted those above me and 
got down to publishing my orders, those who'd been

16:09.652 --> 16:20.926
nominated. You know, they're promoted over a 
period of a year.

16:27.073 --> 16:34.022
And I never had a finer job than working with 
General Kennard on top of that division.

16:38.153 --> 17:07.418
you take those things right I must say it a little 
bit a little bit more uh stirring than being

16:38.153 --> 17:07.418
promoted to colonel or the lieutenant colonel but 
they all all promotions are that way the next one

16:38.153 --> 17:07.418
looks better well then the next one came just about 
a year and a half which is incredible to in a year and

16:38.153 --> 17:07.418
a half to go from one star to two star general how can 
you account for that well I'm not sure that I could

16:38.153 --> 17:07.418
uh I think again, being

17:08.157 --> 17:25.252
in the place I was in at the time I was there, I was in a 
very fortunate position as assistant division

17:08.157 --> 17:25.252
commander of that division, and I believe I was 
promoted strictly on that performance.

17:27.875 --> 17:31.478
Because the next major general selection board 
that met, I was selected. And of course I waited

17:33.039 --> 17:36.122
another period of time before I got in line to 
actually receive my orders. But I must judge that

17:40.498 --> 17:43.501
that was it. Would you like to say anything else 
about your experiences in Vietnam before we

17:43.942 --> 17:48.267
leave? I've

17:48.287 --> 17:53.453
covered the questions I want to cover. Let's take a 
break now, and we'll resume later. Okay. I think

17:59.961 --> 18:05.788
when we talk of personalities in command in 
Vietnam, we did have a We've talked about General

18:06.342 --> 18:08.044
Westmoreland. We've talked about our division. 
But in between General Westmoreland and our

18:11.209 --> 18:29.033
division was, in effect, a corps headquarters 
called Third Field Force, commanded by General

18:11.209 --> 18:29.033
Swede Larson, who incidentally was, I believe, a 
contemporary of General Westmoreland's. And he

18:29.053 --> 18:34.240
was a lieutenant general, and he was commanding 
our division and a couple of others in that 3rd

18:35.755 --> 18:40.781
Corps area. And he was really a counterpart to the 
Vietnamese 3rd Corps. And I might add that in the

18:43.305 --> 19:04.632
matter of using and working with the South 
Vietnamese, that was the level at which the South

18:43.305 --> 19:04.632
Vietnamese divisions and the U.S. divisions were 
coordinated, is at corps level, above our

18:43.305 --> 19:04.632
division level, you see. And General 
Westmoreland, General Larson, of course we saw

19:05.506 --> 19:15.660
him often, and he was down in the train a long way off 
in distance, but of course we had good

19:05.506 --> 19:15.660
communication. Those helicopters again came in 
very handy because he could get around to his

19:15.720 --> 19:24.473
divisions very reasonably that way. But he was a 
very strong personality, although a quiet man.

19:31.883 --> 19:34.146
And I think one of the finest commanders ever. in 
Vietnam. Naturally, he was our corps commander,

19:36.904 --> 19:44.453
and I saw more of him than I did the other corps 
commanders. Why do you say he was one of the finest?

19:47.036 --> 19:51.562
Because of the effectiveness with which he 
commanded. I think it was a misfortune that

19:51.642 --> 20:01.153
he came home after his first year, came to the 
United States. I'm going to get back to the press

20:01.174 --> 20:04.858
for a minute here.

20:06.138 --> 20:13.005
And he was interviewed by the press, I believe in 
San Francisco. He was about to depart to go back to

20:15.188 --> 20:18.291
Vietnam. For a second tour? To continue his tour. 
He was just home on a brief stay. And I can't even

20:24.678 --> 20:31.566
recall the details of the subject that was brought 
up, but a controversial subject was brought up.

20:31.846 --> 20:35.470
And in his typical fashion, he very quietly and 
honestly addressed the matter, which was his view

20:35.905 --> 20:45.880
was somewhat in conflict with that of the 
Secretary of Defense. And he got in, I think,

20:46.982 --> 20:49.285
serious trouble over that. And it's most 
unfortunate because it wasn't that big a thing. Do

20:52.450 --> 20:53.952
you remember what it was about? I don't recall. It 
wasn't that important, you see. It was just the

20:57.959 --> 21:04.849
fact that when he talked about it, he talked about 
it as he viewed it. I always, I've mentioned this

21:07.495 --> 21:23.531
simply because I felt he had such capabilities 
that he was going to continue, probably be one of

21:07.495 --> 21:23.531
the very top officers in the Army when he left 
Vietnam. But I believe he retired as a, I'm sure he

21:23.551 --> 21:29.376
retired as a lieutenant general. And that one 
statement might have hindered his career? I think

21:32.199 --> 21:33.300
it got him into difficulties with the Secretary of 
Defense and the Secretary of Army. Now that's not a

21:38.193 --> 21:48.285
matter of black and white because perhaps he 
shouldn't have opened his mouth, but once he did,

21:38.193 --> 21:48.285
you know, he told it like it was. And it hadn't come 
out quite that way by an earlier statement out of

21:49.687 --> 22:01.380
the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

22:01.782 --> 22:11.692
I'm over, we were saying too much about this, but I 
did want to mention that because I did expect, had

22:01.782 --> 22:11.692
such great respect for him, and did expect to see 
him with his fourth star. And did General Arson

22:12.753 --> 22:14.555
stay on then? He went back and completed his tour as 
a commander of third field force, or third, it was a

22:15.016 --> 22:24.505
corps command, really. That was the designation 
for it, so we didn't conflict with the core

22:30.065 --> 22:35.190
designation of the Vietnamese.

22:35.210 --> 22:37.272
So, shall we leave Vietnam for a while? Sure. All 
right. What were your feelings when you received

22:39.774 --> 22:44.439
orders to go back to the United States? I was ready.

22:51.126 --> 22:51.826
And when was it? It was 1966. 1967.

22:59.225 --> 22:59.946
Early 67. Yeah, March of 67, I believe.

23:05.153 --> 23:07.416
Okay, March of 1967, and where did you go? Went to 
the Army Materiel Command headquarters in

23:09.059 --> 23:13.344
Washington. As deputy director of research and 
laboratories. As deputy director of research and

23:15.628 --> 23:23.639
laboratories and my first assignment to a 
logistics position. In a sense, this was

23:23.699 --> 23:28.285
logistics, but it was really research and 
development. My function there and I was only

23:29.245 --> 23:46.061
there a brief time until I was promoted to major 
general and therefore

23:29.245 --> 23:46.061
that was a brigadier slot and I needed to be moved 
and General Kennard asked for me to come over to be

23:29.245 --> 23:46.061
his deputy commander. You were only there for 
eight months? That's right. From April 67 to

23:49.544 --> 23:51.466
January 68? That's right. Then I moved over to be 
deputy as a major general to be deputy commander

23:52.106 --> 23:56.991
with General Kennard. But that was an interesting 
eight months, I might add, and I can very briefly

23:57.224 --> 24:02.911
outline what the functions were. One of my 
functions was to be commander of the seven

24:04.492 --> 24:16.967
independent laboratories of the Army Materiel 
Command, and that in itself was fascinating.

24:16.987 --> 24:24.235
These are scientific laboratories dealing with 
basically applied research, but some basic

24:16.987 --> 24:24.235
research. It's basic and applied research is what 
it was. And each commanded by a colonel, each with a

24:27.430 --> 24:35.417
deputy civilian, and each, of course, with a 
different mission. The other part- What were the

24:37.539 --> 24:38.880
missions? Well, for example,

24:39.340 --> 24:56.695
they had a wide range of missions, from

24:39.340 --> 24:56.695
research and development on clothing and 
personal equipment up in Massachusetts, to cold

24:39.340 --> 24:56.695
weather research in Alaska.

25:01.888 --> 25:09.595
Then there was the—oh,

25:01.888 --> 25:09.595
there was a laboratory at the Electronics 
Command. There was a laboratory that was

25:10.396 --> 25:14.699
established in parallel with the Ordnance 
Center. There was a laboratory in

25:15.640 --> 25:27.610
parallel to transportation and one for aviation 
and so forth. And it had very highly educated and

25:28.298 --> 25:35.626
qualified scientists assigned there. Both 
civilian and military? Yes, the scientists were

25:38.028 --> 25:43.855
primarily civilian, but military command and 
some military officers. And then the rest of my

25:43.875 --> 25:53.445
function was as deputy to the Army Materiel 
Command Director of Research and Development.

25:54.168 --> 25:56.830
And, of course, that's just what the term implies. 
And that had to do with supervision of the research

25:57.331 --> 26:05.778
and development effort throughout Army Materiel 
Command and the various subordinate commands.

26:06.839 --> 26:22.453
You see, in the Army, the Army Materiel Command has 
been renamed, but its function was to take this

26:06.839 --> 26:22.453
stated requirement that, like we were speaking of 
when I was down at Fort Sill and the artillery

26:06.839 --> 26:22.453
combat developments set up, And once that 
requirement is stated and approved, in other

26:23.834 --> 26:39.373
words, we, the artillerymen, need this kind of a 
weapon to do this job with, once that's approved,

26:23.834 --> 26:39.373
the Army Interior Low Command has the function of 
producing it. And if there's more development

26:39.893 --> 26:45.160
required than there usually is, they get it done. 
And then their final... So I was operating in

26:50.586 --> 26:53.790
connection with that. But their final 
responsibility is to produce it, or have it

26:54.158 --> 27:00.426
produced by contract. So that's what that 
amounted to, and it was very interesting. And

27:02.448 --> 27:10.959
there was one interesting incident occurred that 
kind of sidelined me from this for a while, for

27:02.448 --> 27:10.959
about three months. There was a very—General 
Besson was commanding. General Frank Besson was

27:16.286 --> 27:22.714
commanding Army Materiel Command, and he used a 
system of what he called— He used project

27:23.487 --> 27:25.669
managers. In other words, he would define an area 
that had to go through this process of research,

27:27.552 --> 27:43.910
development, manufacture, supplying, you know, 
resupplying, and so forth, and he'd turn it over to

27:27.552 --> 27:43.910
one officer to be responsible for it from the start 
to the end. He was in charge of that whole project,

27:45.212 --> 27:52.600
and he theoretically had the authority of the 
commanding general with the other agencies to get

27:53.963 --> 27:55.004
that job done. And these people reported directly 
to him, and he had a fantastic capacity to

27:55.604 --> 28:11.378
assimilate and remember details of these various 
projects because he had a number of these project

27:55.604 --> 28:11.378
managers reporting directly to him. He had a 
project manager who

28:11.398 --> 28:23.768
was in charge of producing on the very highest 
priority.

28:24.305 --> 28:52.219
material for what was referred to as the McNamara 
Line in Vietnam, in which new types of sensors were

28:24.305 --> 28:52.219
developed by sensing sound or sensing motion, 
sensing light, to try to keep up with the movement

28:53.819 --> 29:04.416
in critical areas of the enemy, particularly in

28:53.819 --> 29:04.416
the border areas.

29:05.478 --> 29:15.895
And then there were involved also some exotic 
weapons, munitions, that could be automatically

29:05.478 --> 29:15.895
set off by sound or stepping on them, you know, 
light weight, and so forth. And this project

29:21.257 --> 29:32.809
office had the job of getting that done, and that 
was commanded by a colonel, headed by a colonel,

29:21.257 --> 29:32.809
and he had a heart attack, disabling heart attack. 
And this project was tied right in with the

29:34.170 --> 29:40.637
Secretary of Defense's office with a very senior 
general running it for the Secretary of Defense.

29:40.697 --> 29:45.662
It had the very highest priority, and we met 
Anyway, I was appointed to jump in and take over

29:46.385 --> 29:52.732
this job until he could find another project 
manager. And it was a fascinating experience

29:52.752 --> 29:58.438
because it involved this whole gamut of things to 
include procurement. I'd never been involved in

29:58.458 --> 30:00.461
procurement in my life. And I recall making a trip 
to a producer and actually contracting to buy a

30:01.221 --> 30:14.636
certain number of sensors on a handshake. And 
that, I guess, was unheard of. And we visualized

30:17.570 --> 30:25.099
volumes of paperwork to get a procurement order 
out and so forth and so on. But in this case, it was

30:26.681 --> 30:31.888
done on a handshake and they went to work and the 
paperwork came later. But that was because of the

30:33.310 --> 30:38.116
priority of Texas Instruments in Dallas, Texas. 
It was because of the priorities of this project.

30:41.600 --> 30:47.307
Well, of course, I think I was with it three months 
and I found it fascinating. They found you another

30:48.839 --> 30:50.061
job. But I left them to go to this other job. And they 
found another colonel to take it over. Tell me

30:55.730 --> 30:58.475
about this so-called McNamara line. I've heard 
some things about this. Was it ever in any way

31:00.738 --> 31:02.742
successful?

31:06.968 --> 31:07.710
Let me say this. The full array that would have made 
it successful I think was never finally fully

31:08.130 --> 31:15.943
completed. I think it was useful, but to call it a 
success, I never saw that kind of evidence. You

31:21.783 --> 31:24.126
know, call it completely successful. And 
remember, we were really in the waning stages of

31:24.466 --> 31:31.515
that war, too. This was in late 67. No, we were still 
pretty active, yeah. I guess it's fair to say that

31:38.204 --> 31:41.908
it was useful.

31:43.671 --> 31:45.593
But the project was still carried on. for a great 
length of time, and I think they're still building

31:46.737 --> 31:52.164
on those requirements. And I think someday that it 
will be very significant.

31:58.952 --> 32:14.432
One of the requirements, which we had not 
developed when I lost touch with it, is for a means

31:58.952 --> 32:14.432
of processing signals that you get from 
pre-positioned

31:58.952 --> 32:14.432
sensors. And here is where you've got to tie in the 
computer. So that requirement has to be finally

32:20.407 --> 32:25.152
met. Then when you get the computer that can 
handle, and all this is being, I'm sure, still

32:25.172 --> 32:31.758
actively worked on. After you get the computer 
then that can put the data together, the human mind

32:33.479 --> 32:39.785
has still got to make judgments. So you've got to 
have the people organized properly to assess

32:45.378 --> 32:55.390
all this information and see that a timely action 
is taken on it. Really, we're talking about

32:56.411 --> 32:58.693
intelligence, of course. Sure. Intelligence 
gathering. Intelligence gathering. And it's not

33:01.637 --> 33:04.961
intelligence, of course, until it's processed. 
Information gathering is what we're talking

33:05.021 --> 33:07.103
about. But

33:07.203 --> 33:14.912
I think great strides are going to be made in this. 
the computer's going to have an important part in

33:15.348 --> 33:17.330
it. There's no question about it. Even in Vietnam, 
before this was even tried, in our division, we

33:18.872 --> 33:33.710
could get more intelligence information than we 
could handle and process on a timely basis right

33:18.872 --> 33:33.710
there. And the reason we got more, I thought, was 
one, there were several. First, we concentrated

33:39.417 --> 33:41.359
on intelligence. And if you concentrate on it, 
you'll get more. but also we did have electronic

33:45.048 --> 33:48.572
intelligence, which helped a great deal. 
Furthermore, we had all of these eyes in the sky all

33:49.993 --> 34:04.308
the time with these 400-plus aircraft, and it's 
tremendous the amount of detail that over a period

33:49.993 --> 34:04.308
of a day would come in just from observation. Sure. 
But anyway, you could see the need right there. for

34:12.065 --> 34:30.792
better means of collating their stuff, you know, 
matching items up to produce conclusive

34:12.065 --> 34:30.792
intelligence or contributing intelligence that 
leads you to a conclusion that prompts you to act,

34:12.065 --> 34:30.792
and prompts you to act in time. Did you work with the 
CIA and DIA at, I mean, did you have, for these few

34:31.613 --> 34:41.447
months, did you have close cooperation with these 
other agencies?

34:41.883 --> 34:43.065
during this project work. Actually, that was 
performed at OSD level, Secretary of Defense

34:43.205 --> 34:49.734
Office level.

34:54.180 --> 35:04.515
During the Vietnam War, this wasn't- I remember 
that, and it wasn't a very large amount of time, but

34:54.180 --> 35:04.515
I remember that there was some discussion about a 
McNamara wall to separate North and South Vietnam

35:05.103 --> 35:14.094
by some sort of atomic wall or nuclear or radiation 
wall or something. Do you remember anything about

35:14.374 --> 35:15.555
that? No, I really don't. I'm not knowledgeable on 
that. Of course, it was never put into place, but I

35:18.739 --> 35:23.605
just remember that in the press. Okay. Were there 
any other significant research and development

35:24.927 --> 35:29.212
projects going on? Are you free to talk about those 
while you were? Well, of course. At that time, this

35:35.512 --> 35:40.739
was the exotic one that I became acquainted with. 
But, of course, there's a constant effort. Oh,

35:44.164 --> 35:44.985
sure. As you can imagine. I outlined just a few of 
the things that we were after in the field

35:47.708 --> 35:52.335
artillery 20 years ago. Well, everybody else is 
trying to accomplish the same basic goals. And it

35:58.523 --> 36:01.087
was a fascinating command. Now, this command 
also, of course, was the big supply agency for the

36:01.127 --> 36:04.371
whole Army. procurement and supply. And it was the 
maintenance, the highest echelons of

36:08.608 --> 36:14.097
maintenance came under this command. So, it would 
have been interesting to complete a two or three

36:15.639 --> 36:29.121
year tour there, but I was shunted to the Combat 
Development Command, which pleased me a great

36:15.639 --> 36:29.121
deal because General Kinnar was there and it was, 
I'd had a prior assignment in it and it was very

36:15.639 --> 36:29.121
interesting to me. Okay, so you were there in the 
Combat Developments Command, but from February

36:33.680 --> 36:39.987
68 to November 68, not very long. What did you do 
there for seven months? I was the deputy

36:43.772 --> 36:51.461
commander, and I also functioned as chief of 
staff. This was a staff organization, basically.

36:55.946 --> 36:59.290
At that headquarters, we had the staff 
organization. Then we had various subordinate

37:01.135 --> 37:04.962
combat development command around the country. 
We had, you might call it, it had its own name, but

37:07.466 --> 37:21.270
you might call it a tactical group or a combat unit 
grouping headquarters at Fort Leavenworth,

37:07.466 --> 37:21.270
Kansas. at the Command General Staff College. 
They supervised the combat development commands

37:25.160 --> 37:32.749
of the combat arms, which were generally located 
with their branch schools. Then we had a similar

37:33.970 --> 37:47.545
group headquarters that oversaw the supply and 
service agencies, combat development agencies.

37:49.921 --> 37:59.454
involved at Combat Development Headquarters 
with directing all of these people

37:49.921 --> 37:59.454
in this area that I mentioned earlier. How should 
we be organized in the Army? How should we fight?

38:09.208 --> 38:11.611
How should we be equipped, and how should we fight? 
And we determined the answer to those questions in

38:13.314 --> 38:18.561
the form of requirements for the development 
tables of organization,

38:19.942 --> 38:29.714
new equipments, new weapons, new systems, and new 
doctrine. And that was the mission of that

38:32.238 --> 38:34.260
organization. Now, I wasn't there very long 
because— Well, why weren't you—why were you only

38:34.400 --> 38:41.249
there for seven months?

38:42.771 --> 38:49.780
Because the chief staff, General Westmoreland, 
said that he wanted me to be his chief—the chief

38:42.771 --> 38:49.780
legislative liaison for the Army. And I'm 
chuckling because I didn't want to leave. I was

38:52.831 --> 38:54.313
very happy where I was. I'd just really gotten my 
teeth into my work there. I

38:59.019 --> 39:08.773
liked working for General Kennard, and so I didn't 
want to go. He reclaimed it for me. I don't know that

39:10.916 --> 39:17.245
he got in trouble, but I know he got fussed after 
resisting. But anyway, I went up there. Chief of

39:20.827 --> 39:26.734
Legislative Liaison after seven months in this 
command, and I finished my Army career as Chief of

39:20.827 --> 39:26.734
Legislative Liaison.

39:29.978 --> 39:31.180
Well, this is your last job. Let's talk about this. 
This is one of the most important jobs, at least

39:32.621 --> 39:38.929
politically, that you ever had. Did you like it? I 
liked it very much. I really did. I found it worthy

39:44.316 --> 39:49.602
of anyone's application and effort. It's a unique 
job in the Army that none other liked. The function

39:57.952 --> 40:10.911
was to work with the Congress for the Army, and the 
business we had with the Congress included

39:57.952 --> 40:10.911
several things. First of all, of course, it was our 
legislation, the most important of which was our

40:12.293 --> 40:19.703
budget. Sure, absolutely. And, of course, that 
budget includes money for all these things we're

40:22.302 --> 40:33.312
talking about, not only operating and 
maintaining what we've got, but developing these

40:22.302 --> 40:33.312
new things and procuring them. And, of course, 
legislation included special legislation or

40:33.332 --> 40:50.689
non-routine legislation, such as, well, you'd be 
interested, for example, what would be such

40:33.332 --> 40:50.689
things as a GI Bill or pay legislation or... 
authorizations for strength of the Army,

40:51.884 --> 41:05.963
such things as the ratio of officers in various 
grades to soldiers or to the strength of the Army,

40:51.884 --> 41:05.963
all sorts of things. Anything that has to be 
legislated. That's right. And so we were the

41:09.988 --> 41:15.095
funnel out of the Army and back through to the Army 
staff on this. And how many people did you have? I

41:18.019 --> 41:20.342
had a few over 100 people. Gee whiz. Now, you'll 
understand this, why we had that many when I

41:21.719 --> 41:27.125
finished the functions. Another function was to 
handle the correspondence between the Army and

41:27.586 --> 41:34.494
the Congress. In other words, if Private John Doe 
in Vietnam writes his congressman and says, I was

41:34.514 --> 41:46.909
supposed to go home a month ago, and I don't have my 
orders yet. I mean, he's just exasperated.

41:48.871 --> 41:49.752
Anything from that on up to such things as the Ryden 
Hoover letter about me lying. That comes to my

41:55.558 --> 41:57.080
office. I forget the figures, but I think we 
handled 1,500

41:58.182 --> 42:11.798
letters a week to the Congress on everything you 
can imagine. Congressmen inquiring for their own

42:14.221 --> 42:19.688
edification for information, data,

42:21.085 --> 42:27.393
or individuals in the Army writing their 
congressman, which happens frequently, and

42:21.085 --> 42:27.393
that's their right, and that's all right. Another 
function of that office was to handle

42:28.554 --> 42:36.604
congressional investigations that affected the 
Army. In other words, be the contact in the Army for

42:36.644 --> 42:42.391
congressional investigations.

42:43.632 --> 42:49.219
It was my duty to handle several items of bad news 
during my tour there, because this This was a very

42:49.857 --> 42:57.085
abnormal period in Army history, in my opinion. 
During my tour as Chief Legislative Liaison, this

42:57.105 --> 43:07.397
disenchantment with Vietnam was growing in the 
minds of the people. And, of course, Congress

43:07.838 --> 43:11.382
truly is a reflection of the people. And I think 
that's what it's intended to be.

43:17.429 --> 43:19.071
For example, we had the My Lai thing. which was a 
tremendous investigation. We had the... Which

43:25.653 --> 43:28.898
you subsequently handed over to the Inspector 
General. Well, yes, but we still... The Congress

43:32.885 --> 43:35.129
started its own investigation, you know. Sure. So 
you worked with them. So I worked with them and had

43:38.093 --> 43:42.280
to coordinate with the Army and follow them both. 
Then you might recall we had...

43:49.274 --> 43:55.441
The matter of the senior non-commissioned 
officer taking kickbacks from clubs and so forth.

43:56.102 --> 44:01.468
Even the former sergeant major of the Army was 
involved. And then we had the case... What

44:01.488 --> 44:03.831
happened to him? He was court-martialed. Then we 
had the case of the...

44:08.517 --> 44:15.805
And this was in Vietnam, wasn't it? That he was 
taking the kickbacks of Vietnam. And he was

44:19.019 --> 44:20.321
running, I remember. It also had occurred in 
Europe. And the same people were, the same

44:22.623 --> 44:26.666
non-coms were involved at different times. And 
then we had the case of the Major General, former

44:28.428 --> 44:43.362
Provo Marshal General of the Army, being 
investigated for accepting rare weapons as

44:28.428 --> 44:43.362
contributions In other words, sort of not for the 
Army, but... Personal. Personal, but because he

44:51.296 --> 44:54.300
was who he was, and then selling them. Oh, selling 
them, too? Trading in them and selling them. And

44:58.224 --> 44:59.966
what happened to him? I don't recall, but he got his 
just desserts. Then we had a case of a brigadier

45:05.132 --> 45:14.142
general whom I knew who was accused of... frauds 
and the PX system in Europe and in Vietnam

45:15.573 --> 45:41.462
and he was found these are congressional 
investigations now yeah right anytime the

45:15.573 --> 45:41.462
Congress starts an investigation the army has to 
parallel it to keep them you know to provide them

45:15.573 --> 45:41.462
what the information they need from us and did you 
direct and and quite and also the reverse sure did

45:15.573 --> 45:41.462
you direct the investigations or did you leave 
that to To the IG? No, no. The investigations were

45:43.132 --> 45:49.640
always directed by the Inspector General or the 
Chief Staff's Office. You see, I worked

45:49.661 --> 45:50.622
directly... So you worked between them. Yes, I was 
a coordinator with the Congress, in and out of the

45:52.224 --> 45:56.770
Congress. Now, I remember my direct boss was the 
Secretary of the Army. Who was at that time?

46:06.924 --> 46:08.886
Secretary Stanley Reaser, a very fine one. 
Secretary Reaser, yeah. who later became the

46:10.400 --> 46:17.828
negotiator in SALT talks and he later became 
Deputy Secretary of Defense.

46:21.772 --> 46:32.384
But my function said I would be responsible to the 
Secretary of the Army and responsive to the Chief

46:21.772 --> 46:32.384
of Staff. So I really had two bosses.

46:40.049 --> 46:43.754
Do you have some other examples of some of the 
congressional investigations? Those were the

46:45.336 --> 46:47.399
significant ones. Okay, fine. And they were all 
painful ones for the Army, because they were all

46:48.961 --> 46:52.425
bad news. Yeah. Which, of course, brings the next 
question. From 68 to 70, America, especially the

46:57.612 --> 47:06.664
youth in America, are turning against the war in 
Vietnam, and there's an increasing...
