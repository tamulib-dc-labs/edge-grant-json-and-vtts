00:02.123 --> 00:19.348
The objectives that you had in Moscow, new air 
routes into Moscow, development of free or

00:02.123 --> 00:19.348
exchange of weather information, and the shuttle 
bases, were they accomplished? The exchange of

00:19.369 --> 00:28.502
weather information was by far the most 
successful, and some way or another,

00:29.815 --> 00:37.947
whenever this Navy representative, the United 
States Navy representative came over they met him

00:29.815 --> 00:37.947
on time and were very cordial and this went well. I 
wish everything else went that easy in relation to

00:38.608 --> 00:42.675
the Russians. And we continued throughout the, 
until the end of the Japanese war to get all the

00:42.935 --> 00:51.248
weather information we needed from the Russians 
and very reliable.

00:55.554 --> 00:57.477
That was successful. The establishment of air 
routes wasn't too successful. We never even

01:02.801 --> 01:11.669
approached getting an air route in the northern 
Murmask area down to Leningrad and Moscow. Never

01:11.689 --> 01:14.471
even approached that. They wouldn't even talk 
about it. Why not, do you think? I don't know. Just

01:19.275 --> 01:21.757
wouldn't do it. Weather-wise, it would have been a 
difficult one.

01:28.760 --> 01:43.057
They just didn't want, on the question of air 
routes, they just did not want to open up their

01:28.760 --> 01:43.057
country that much and make it that easy for foreign 
airplanes and foreign air crews to fly over their

01:28.760 --> 01:43.057
country. I'm sure this is a basic philosophy. They 
just didn't want to do it. It's opened up the

01:47.162 --> 01:49.404
country too much. They didn't want that many 
foreigners in their country. How about the

01:51.642 --> 01:53.205
southern routes? The southern route from—see, we 
had at that time a United States Army organization

01:53.225 --> 02:03.923
in Iran called the Southern Supply Command, I 
think that's what it was. Were they British? Yeah.

02:06.648 --> 02:15.844
And pouring Lend-Lease equipment, just pouring 
it up through the truck rail routes into southern

02:06.648 --> 02:15.844
Russia.

02:16.128 --> 02:21.134
We weren't successful in establishing an air 
transport command route into Moscow at all.

02:21.234 --> 02:42.779
Matter of fact, it was difficult enough even to 
establish the required air transport sorties up

02:21.234 --> 02:42.779
to the shuttle bases to resupply them with the 
necessary bombs, belly tanks, and maintenance

02:21.234 --> 02:42.779
equipment, and fuel. Fuel, I don't think we had. or 
they could provide the fuel. But we weren't

02:47.280 --> 02:48.883
successful there. Now, on the Alcib route. Which 
one? Alcib, from Alaska to Siberia, across into

02:53.229 --> 02:59.838
the European front.

03:01.961 --> 03:06.527
See, that's the route that we flew a lot of the 
airplanes, actually flew the airplanes through.

03:06.547 --> 03:08.910
They picked them up in Alaska. We tried our best, 
and I personally wrote. I figured I had the answer

03:12.355 --> 03:15.379
to it. I wrote a personal study to General Dean, and 
the ambassador was very happy to get it, and even

03:15.713 --> 03:25.826
sent it forward to General Arnold, well, the Air 
Force back home. And we all agreed it was a way to get

03:26.006 --> 03:38.241
the Russians to start building bases in Siberia 
that would take B-17s if we gave them to them. And I

03:38.261 --> 03:44.809
think I even recommended giving them a few because 
it would force them to start building bases in

03:38.261 --> 03:44.809
Siberia that would take bombers. And then if they 
would build bases to take bombers, then we could

03:47.652 --> 03:58.226
ultimately, if necessary, use their bases to bomb 
Japan from the north. Sure. So it was sort of a

03:58.726 --> 04:03.132
leverage that we would do. Well, they wanted the 
airplane. So you wanted to fly from Alaska to

04:04.974 --> 04:07.137
Vladivostok? Yeah. And actually, that's the way 
they ferried fighter airplanes, a lot of them. As a

04:13.806 --> 04:14.847
matter of fact, most of them. Well, the P-39, most 
of them were assembled in Tehran and so on. But we

04:21.573 --> 04:42.319
actually went as far as to, following my plan at 
Offord, we actually went as far as to organize a

04:21.573 --> 04:42.319
B-17 unit, which was going to be headed up by a very 
controversial old figure, Butch Morgan, a

04:21.573 --> 04:42.319
colonel in the Air Force, quite a character.

04:43.447 --> 04:47.271
He actually made a visit over to Moscow, and we 
talked about it in detail. But we didn't request

04:48.232 --> 04:51.336
Russian meetings at that time. And we were going to 
organize a unit of B-17s, and he would fly the whole

04:52.057 --> 05:01.067
thing right through to get the B-17s in Russia. 
Well, they went along with us until we got it up to

05:02.108 --> 05:05.773
Alaska. Then they just stopped on the negotiation 
flat and said, well, look, we'll take the

05:05.793 --> 05:11.479
airplane. They didn't want any aircraft. And then 
as a result, we turned them down. We didn't get any

05:16.130 --> 05:18.053
aircraft. And that was my recommendation. So they 
didn't want any American to land in Vladivostok?

05:24.903 --> 05:25.684
That was the problem? They didn't want any 
American flying into Russia, transporting

05:26.005 --> 05:32.555
aircraft. Their fighter pilots came down to 
Tehran and picked up a P-39 and bombed into Russia.

05:37.193 --> 05:40.777
We checked them out right there on the base in 
Tehran, and they flew into Russia. Or they came to

05:40.797 --> 05:41.858
Alaska. Or they came to Alaska and flew there. And 
air transport-wise, there was never an air

05:47.464 --> 05:58.776
transport aircraft, an ATC airplane per se, that 
ever flew into Moscow from Murmansk, Alaska, or

05:47.464 --> 05:58.776
Tehran. So that objective, in effect, we didn't 
achieve. On the shuttle bases, as I've told you, we

06:03.856 --> 06:07.980
developed those. And it turned out to be 
operational.

06:15.847 --> 06:32.243
To what extent it impacted the end of the war, or 
accelerated the end of the war, slowed the

06:15.847 --> 06:32.243
fighting down, or impressed the Germans, I'm not 
sure. But it served to make us work closer with the

06:35.008 --> 06:39.553
Russians and vice versa.

06:42.296 --> 06:55.090
It gave us more of an insight, let's say 
intelligence-wise, into the Red Army and the Red

06:42.296 --> 06:55.090
Air Force and their thinking, their war planning, 
operations. By the same token, it gave them a

06:55.110 --> 07:01.217
better insight into our strategic bomber 
operations and our people, our crews, our

07:01.822 --> 07:06.967
equipment. I think from a standpoint of maybe 
impressing each other, it was successful. From a

07:18.279 --> 07:31.373
standpoint of tactical applications and 
operations, the Red Army was advancing so far, so

07:18.279 --> 07:31.373
fast anyhow, into Germany from the east that It 
wasn't really absolutely necessary. I think it

07:35.361 --> 07:43.172
was more of a political strategic coordination 
plan than a tactical requirement.

07:44.153 --> 07:49.081
I learned a lot from it, and my tour in Russia. I 
wouldn't take anything in the world for that.

07:51.804 --> 07:56.571
Yeah, let's talk about, sort of summarize your 
tour. Is there any other specifics that we should

07:56.631 --> 07:59.976
talk about as far as your tour in Russia? Before we 
summarize it, let me think a moment. Maybe

08:03.200 --> 08:10.049
I ought to bring one thing up. And if I'm not 
mistaken, I think I talked openly with the

08:11.611 --> 08:29.575
Ambassador, and certainly with General Dean 
about this several times, is the visits of vets, if

08:11.611 --> 08:29.575
you will, to Russia. During a time we were over 
there, to see certain things like,

08:29.943 --> 08:46.188
I forget the name of the industrial giant, either 
General Motors or somebody that was brought on

08:29.943 --> 08:46.188
duty in OPA. Office of Price Administration. 
Right. During the war, or no, production, some job

08:50.695 --> 08:54.621
in production. It was some industrial titan that 
was brought on duty aboard industrial

08:59.862 --> 09:05.050
planning, he came over to Russia. It was the head of 
some big corporation, either General Motors or

09:05.891 --> 09:09.917
General Electric, something like that. I forget 
who he was. Anyhow, he knew General Ambassador

09:11.840 --> 09:16.808
Herman was a friend.

09:19.387 --> 09:23.691
And, of course, he made arrangements for his visit 
to certain factories in Russia. And Ambassador

09:23.711 --> 09:33.980
Harriman, of course, usually received these bips 
first, meets them, you know, depends on what their

09:23.711 --> 09:33.980
stature is and how much time he gives them, and who 
escorts them in the field. I never escorted any of

09:34.900 --> 09:41.046
the Soviet-type military types like I was telling 
about General Cannon's visit. But

09:41.066 --> 09:49.393
the comments I want to make, in general,

09:51.685 --> 09:56.470
These visitors would come, and they'd go out in the 
field, and then, of course, they'd come back. And

09:57.671 --> 10:11.386
before they left, most of them, I don't care really 
what their rank was, when they came back to leave,

09:57.671 --> 10:11.386
Ambassador Herman was interested in hearing 
their comments, particularly the high-level

09:57.671 --> 10:11.386
ones, you know. They'd go to conference even. But

10:13.649 --> 10:21.557
generally speaking, the Visitors on these trips 
got the wrong impression of Russia. No kidding.

10:30.148 --> 10:31.870
Yes, generally speaking, I'm saying. Now, this is 
discussion that Ambassador Herman a few times,

10:33.933 --> 10:48.693
and General Dean on several occasions, and I 
personally talk, you know, officially at

10:33.933 --> 10:48.693
meetings, and then sometimes just over coffee, 
you know, after dinner. Generally speaking, they

10:48.713 --> 10:52.017
were given the wrong impression They didn't 
realize that for their trip and what they saw was

10:52.604 --> 11:11.206
pre-planned to the very pencils on the table

10:52.604 --> 11:11.206
by the Russians for these visitors. It was 
arranged on a basis to show the visitor what Russia

11:12.668 --> 11:21.278
wanted him to see based on what Russians wanted to 
impress him with and get out of him what they wanted

11:23.030 --> 11:33.359
the most without any due regard on whatsoever of 
what the visitor's purpose was. Let's say if he

11:33.740 --> 11:41.387
wanted to see how our supplies were used in Russia, 
that was not the Russian objective at all. Their

11:41.847 --> 11:49.314
objective was to show him the need for more 
supplies and to show him maybe we weren't getting

11:41.847 --> 11:49.314
supplies. I mean that they weren't getting 
supplies. The Russians staged the whole thing.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.585
That's a good word, staged the whole thing. And I 
don't think the visitor realized this. They'd

12:02.167 --> 12:08.534
come back and say, gee, I saw things over here. He 
says, you realize what they've got over here? Have

12:10.356 --> 12:11.317
you ever seen this? And at times, you know, it would 
take us to task. I guess they came back with a more

12:16.962 --> 12:21.707
positive approach that

12:24.674 --> 12:35.828
this is the greatest outfit in the world and they 
need our help and they're doing more than you think

12:24.674 --> 12:35.828
they're doing and maybe you folks are being too 
negative here in the mission. This is the general

12:36.368 --> 12:40.814
impression we got.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.097
I distinctly remember this. In other words, the 
guy that came over there and was shown a staged

12:43.537 --> 12:50.766
review of Russia left and didn't know what the hell 
he was

12:55.876 --> 13:06.228
I distinctly remember when I first went to Russia, 
I met Air Force Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, who I

12:55.876 --> 13:06.228
was in effect to replace. He was out of shape. See, 
we were making a bigger organization, a military

13:07.910 --> 13:11.214
mission. And I remember meeting him on the way over 
in England, and he and I sat down one night just to

13:11.575 --> 13:16.600
converse with one another. And I distinctly 
remember this. I, a new man, going to Russia, had a

13:23.433 --> 13:51.769
complete new approach you know and I was 
optimistic and looking forward to it and here I was

13:23.433 --> 13:51.769
talking to a very disgruntled

13:23.433 --> 13:51.769
frustrated

13:23.433 --> 13:51.769
man that was tickled to death to get out of Russia 
and leave his job and was fed up with the whole thing

13:23.433 --> 13:51.769
and in other words was a very negative person and I 
remember thinking well no wonder were having

13:52.070 --> 13:55.034
problems dealing with the Russians. I tried Bond 
to do better than this. And in six months, I was

13:57.657 --> 14:01.102
almost the same as he was. So this, I just mentioned 
this as a parallel to what I'm saying about the

14:02.404 --> 14:08.952
visitor who goes to Russia. And in 13 months, and 
you left Russia, were you as negative as that

14:09.092 --> 14:13.458
lieutenant colonel? Oh, yeah.

14:18.044 --> 14:18.685
And... I guess I spoke it more freely and showed it 
more freely than I, here I was only a colonel, I'm

14:19.593 --> 14:36.353
sure General Dean, of course he stayed there 
longer, but ultimately, you know, he wrote his

14:19.593 --> 14:36.353
book, The Strange Alliance, and he reflected the 
feelings.

14:38.937 --> 14:47.507
I remember after six months, I was talking to my 
army officer, and I remember distinctly saying,

14:38.937 --> 14:47.507
Dut, I said, we're never going to be able to do 
business with these people. I said, I practically

14:54.826 --> 14:56.468
give up. I'm through. What did he say? He felt the 
same way. But of course, when I said I'm through, I

15:01.895 --> 15:06.160
didn't mean it that way. And we both agreed. But we 
didn't give up. We said, we just have to keep trying

15:11.747 --> 15:17.494
our best and find ways to be more communicative 
with them. it's, and I still say it, it's

15:18.250 --> 15:27.859
difficult, difficult to do business with a 
Russian hierarchy. Now, were you dismissed from

15:27.879 --> 15:39.591
that job or replaced because your tour of duty was a 
certain time length, or did you request, how did

15:27.879 --> 15:39.591
you leave? In effect, my tour of duty was over. It 
was generally felt that I'd be over there for about

15:45.993 --> 15:47.876
a year. And I think, matter of fact, that's about 
the way General Arnold indicated, that you'd be

15:47.916 --> 15:55.526
over there about a year, never bring you back home. 
And of course, one of the objectives was, since we

15:56.247 --> 16:10.648
hadn't set up the mission, is get a chance to train 
as many Air Force officers as possible in Russia.

16:11.248 --> 16:15.915
And that's one way to get me back and get another 
colonel over there. No. And I admit, I was ready to

16:19.078 --> 16:20.600
come home. This may have shown in my frustration, 
but I never, matter of fact, I got very good fishing

16:21.161 --> 16:32.480
reports from everybody, and Mr. Harriman hated 
seeing me go. We, Mr. Harriman and I sincerely had a

16:32.580 --> 16:36.987
great mutual respect for one another. We got along 
great. What did he say to you when you left? Did you

16:42.676 --> 16:43.978
have a meeting with him? Well, the last time I saw 
him was when we landed at National Airport. Oh, so

16:50.289 --> 16:51.410
you brought him back? No, we came back. I left my 
airplane over there. Another crew was signed, and

16:54.494 --> 16:58.419
we came back from...

17:01.764 --> 17:05.709
I think we came down to Cairo in my airplane and left 
it there.

17:11.036 --> 17:14.421
Yeah, and then from there we rode on a C-54 type air 
transport command, regular type airport, but

17:14.907 --> 17:24.500
especially chartered for him with no other 
passengers, just him and me and Kathy and, oh,

17:14.907 --> 17:24.500
maybe one or two other guys. Then we landed at, 
eventually landed at National Airport in

17:25.121 --> 17:37.118
Washington, D.C., and that's where Chip Boland 
brought my wife out to meet me, and I shook hands

17:25.121 --> 17:37.118
with him, and him and Kathy both, and I think I put 
one around Kathy, you know, kiss her goodbye. We

17:43.359 --> 17:46.863
learned to know each other very well, very close. I 
shook hands with the ambassador and told him how

17:46.883 --> 17:58.614
much I, it was a, not real emotional, I hated to say 
goodbye to him, because I liked him, and I felt he

17:46.883 --> 17:58.614
felt the same way. He shook hands, and what a great 
guy, and what a grand thing you've done, Troy, and

18:05.465 --> 18:10.150
good luck to you, you're really going to go places 
and all that type of stuff. And I think that's about

18:10.170 --> 18:12.332
the last time I saw him. I ran across him a couple of 
times later in my career. A funny thing, I ran

18:16.036 --> 18:28.128
across him in Udorn, Thailand in 1967 when he was on 
a mission with Hubert Humphrey, a whole group of

18:16.036 --> 18:28.128
politicians, congressmen and all. Somehow or 
another he got a mission to go to Vientiane, Laos.

18:32.072 --> 18:34.594
And then he came back to Udorn to refuel I naturally 
was out there to meet all of the VIPs. All of a

18:40.001 --> 18:41.442
sudden, I saw him walking across. He saw me about 
the same time. So it was quite a reunion for a few

18:43.244 --> 18:45.927
minutes. What did you say to him? What did you say to 
him? Oh, gee, you know, gee, Mr. Ambassador, still

18:51.514 --> 18:52.335
Mr. Ambassador. Just like I, you know, left him a 
few days before, and great to see you and all. He

18:56.540 --> 18:58.202
said, I didn't hear you, Charlie. I said, what are 
you doing? How do you like it and all that stuff? And

19:00.845 --> 19:04.429
then, you know, quickly, he said, hey, come on, I 
want you to meet Hubert. He took me over to

19:04.730 --> 19:08.074
introduce me to him. Was he Vice President then or 
not? Yes. I guess so, yeah. And he introduced me to

19:11.699 --> 19:12.780
him. What did you think of him? Oh, I mean, he liked 
him. He was a very delightful person. Nice. Here he

19:21.711 --> 19:26.917
was talking to an Air Force Major General on the 
spot.

19:31.063 --> 19:31.463
I liked him. Of course, didn't know anything about 
him. It was a happy meeting, you know. He was

19:35.649 --> 19:38.192
smiling and shaking hands and all. And the whole 
area just covered with senators and

19:39.053 --> 19:46.763
representatives, none of whom I even cared about 
meeting at that time, except, of course,

19:39.053 --> 19:46.763
Ambassador Herm. We sat and talked a little. I 
briefed, you know, generally talked about what we

19:48.645 --> 19:52.950
were doing over there and how we were doing it all. 
That must have been a thrill to see him now. Oh,

19:55.453 --> 19:55.914
yeah. He looked older. Yeah. He looked older, and 
of course he was. 20 years older, over 25 years old.

20:03.219 --> 20:17.754
They still had that little hunk in his back, but 
still had the gracious smile and the air of the

20:03.219 --> 20:17.754
diplomat about it. Okay, are we done with Moscow? 
Yeah,

20:19.616 --> 20:23.419
I think so. How would you like to summarize that? 
One of the greatest experiences I think I've ever

20:27.434 --> 20:30.419
had in my life. It no doubt had an impact on my 
feelings about the world situation that probably

20:31.921 --> 20:45.644
are primary to all of my basic philosophy about 
many things in the world. Economic, political,

20:46.545 --> 20:53.256
military, particularly military.

20:55.801 --> 20:59.046
philosophical, if you will, generally speaking, 
psychologically. I guess it's basic to a lot of my

20:59.106 --> 21:05.876
thinking about many of the problems in the world. 
There's no doubt in my mind about what has happened

21:07.318 --> 21:13.267
interdependence-wise between nations. I 
learned this in subsequent ten years working with

21:13.287 --> 21:24.103
TI, the Worldwide Selling of Munitions and 
Armament, a multinational corporation sitting

21:13.287 --> 21:24.103
in management meetings.

21:25.265 --> 21:35.959
In particular, the current communications 
capability and air transport operations in the

21:25.265 --> 21:35.959
nation, no longer can one nation live by itself. 
There's got to be interdependence. Allah, for

21:38.862 --> 21:41.105
instance, now we're getting in bed with China. 
Great. You know, it's inevitable. But what about

21:43.588 --> 21:46.232
Russia? You see, there's, why not? Well, why not? 
It's obvious. It's the ideology of communism. I

21:54.070 --> 21:56.714
feel very strongly about this. Why do you think 
that the communist Chinese can improve relations

21:56.734 --> 22:06.768
with us and seem to get along with us a little bit 
better, and why can't the communist Russians?

22:07.309 --> 22:08.631
Well, I ask rhetorically. What's the difference 
in Chinese communism versus Russian so-called

22:09.332 --> 22:15.020
communism? China has an objective.

22:19.567 --> 22:23.132
They really fear... hate Russia at the same time. 
They have reason to get in bed with us. They don't

22:32.457 --> 22:36.421
have the armed might that the Russians have. They 
have reason to get in bed with us. I predicted in a

22:38.243 --> 22:46.010
file paper I wrote for TI when I left that we will 
sell arms and arm China. And I wrote that in 1975.

22:49.854 --> 22:51.195
People looked at me and doubted me. We're just 
before doing it right now.

22:58.599 --> 23:04.768
I kind of agree with China that it's inevitable 
those two thieves will eventually fight one

22:58.599 --> 23:04.768
another. And if they do, it's got to be worldwide. 
There's no way that those two would start fighting

23:08.733 --> 23:14.561
one another, and it would not spread worldwide. 
OK, let's go to your next assignment. You had two

23:18.006 --> 23:18.887
short questions. Not short, but you had one short 
assignment, October 1944 to January 1945, when

23:19.711 --> 23:30.942
you came back in Washington, D.C., and this looks 
like a Pentagon. Oh, yeah. Tell me about this. What

23:32.763 --> 23:34.165
was your title? Briefly,

23:34.405 --> 23:46.056
I think they put me in the...

23:50.035 --> 23:59.448
I think they put me in a training division under 
operations and training and determining what to

23:50.035 --> 23:59.448
do with me with my Russian experience in 
intelligence. They wanted to keep me there for a

23:59.488 --> 24:01.070
while. I think I spent really most of the time just 
going around briefing key generals on my

24:01.631 --> 24:16.332
experiences in Moscow and giving them 
impressions of my feelings about the Russian

24:01.631 --> 24:16.332
combat capability. And then I I think after that, I 
began to get, you know, look, I'm wasting my time,

24:17.592 --> 24:24.160
give me a job. You were in the special study group 
there. So then in January 1945, we remained all of

24:26.784 --> 24:39.300
1945 in the operations of the Second Air Force in 
Colorado. Where was that in Colorado? Well, like I

24:40.161 --> 24:44.106
say, I got to feeling I wasn't doing anything, and 
of course the Pentagon, it's frustrating doing it

24:44.457 --> 24:52.787
itself, and I finally talked them into letting me 
go out to 2nd Air Force. 2nd Air Force of Colorado

24:52.847 --> 25:13.350
Springs, and it was an organization oriented 
primarily to the training and converting of B-17

24:52.847 --> 25:13.350
crews into B-29 crews, and reintroducing our 
effort in strategic bombing to the bigger ship,

24:52.847 --> 25:13.350
and also to Far East Japan, versus the European 
war, which we knew was lying down. Did you at this

25:13.988 --> 25:16.892
time, you had not been in combat. Now, you'd been 
flying, of course, all the time, but you hadn't

25:16.932 --> 25:23.161
been in combat since 1941, and here it is 1945. Are 
you eager to get back in combat? Well, that's one of

25:26.285 --> 25:27.287
the reasons. I mean, 1942. So 1942 is the last time 
you were in combat, not 1941. So are you eager to get

25:34.377 --> 25:36.260
back in combat? Yes, that's one of the reasons I 
want to go to Colorado, because part of it has a 72nd

25:36.460 --> 25:41.447
Fighter Wing under it, And there was hardly 
anybody on the so-called bomber-oriented staff

25:41.765 --> 25:50.213
of Second Air Force, if you will. And General R.B. 
Williams was commander of Second Air Force at that

25:51.834 --> 26:06.888
time, and he was one of the original B-17 
lieutenants in the second bomb group when I went to

25:51.834 --> 26:06.888
Langley Field on my first site where I first met 
him, and we grew very close. And he knew me

26:06.908 --> 26:10.371
personally with my bomber experience. And, of 
course, he'd heard about me in the Flying Tigers.

26:13.858 --> 26:18.610
So he was delighted to get me, and he made me the 
assistant D.O. under Brooke Allen, who was

26:18.750 --> 26:22.239
oriented primarily to bombers. So he brought some 
fighter experience into his headquarters.

26:27.935 --> 26:32.140
because he had the 72nd Fighter Wing under him, and 
we were training fighter crews. So he was glad to

26:32.160 --> 26:35.164
get me, and I was delighted, of course. So I looked 
forward to that, and that's one reason I went out

26:35.184 --> 26:37.987
there. And I had ideas of, well, I'll get back into 
the fighter business now, and then I'll get me

26:38.007 --> 26:45.516
another gun and go back overseas. And fight the 
Japanese again. Right. But I wasn't sure how long

26:49.261 --> 26:53.146
that Japanese war was going to last. Nobody was. 
Okay, how successful was the training and the

26:55.272 --> 27:00.259
shift over to the B-29? I oriented my efforts 
primarily to fighters. Okay, and what fighters

27:07.047 --> 27:08.910
were you training? What airplane? It was the, well 
it had the primarily orienting the guys to the P-51

27:10.512 --> 27:20.605
and the P-47.

27:21.243 --> 27:25.727
And I think they still had a few old P-40 units that 
had to convert. We were training combat crews.

27:27.809 --> 27:31.373
That's what we were doing for replacement pilots. 
And fighter gunnery was one of the main things that

27:32.494 --> 27:37.238
I started pushing. And I think we developed a 
fighter gunnery base in Matagorda Island, which I

27:37.258 --> 27:48.229
was very happy about because I remember, back in my 
experience, I hadn't been trained in fighter

27:37.258 --> 27:48.229
gunnery. And I needed it. And I wanted to be sure 
that the modern Pollock that we were putting out

27:50.980 --> 27:56.548
had fighter gunnery. We turned out to be, we have 
better fighter gunnery records than the 3rd Air

27:56.568 --> 28:07.103
Force, which was the other fighter train base in 
Florida. I was happy about that. And it got along

28:09.246 --> 28:11.028
well. So you improved their accuracy at that time. 
Oh, yeah. And their capability to shoot down

28:15.615 --> 28:17.878
fighters. How'd you do that? How'd you train them 
to be gunners? Well, in actual missions where they

28:23.016 --> 28:43.783
would fly against fighter sleeves drawn with 
another aircraft down at Matagorda Island, the

28:23.016 --> 28:43.783
gunnery range, you know, way north of the coast, a 
plane would pull a sleeve, and then they'd make a

28:23.016 --> 28:43.783
fighter pass it at the sleeve and actually bring 
the sleeve back down and count the holes in it. And,

28:43.803 --> 28:46.666
of course, we improved the equipment we had in the 
airplane. We had range automatic range setters in

28:48.588 --> 28:58.943
the aiming mechanism for the aircraft. Did you 
have radar by now in these airplanes? No, not at

29:02.968 --> 29:04.010
that time. How were the radio systems? You were 
complaining about the radios before. Well, see

29:08.596 --> 29:11.420
that was the AVG airplanes. We had the radios in 
aircraft were fine. Matter of fact, P-50, I was

29:17.309 --> 29:37.931
ticked, I flew, I checked out and flew an early P-51 
called the A-37, and I'd visit a place where we

29:17.309 --> 29:37.931
still had some of the old P-40s, and the guy, the 
fighter boys were tickled to death to see my

29:17.309 --> 29:37.931
airplane because it looked to them like a P-51. I 
enjoyed that, that was a good tour. And you were

29:40.234 --> 29:46.320
with your wife and family?

29:47.583 --> 29:48.384
Let me see. What after that? Well, let me ask you. Of 
course, you were there when the war ended in Europe

29:52.428 --> 30:03.499
in May of 1945, and again when the war ended in the 
Pacific in August and September of 1945. What were

30:03.699 --> 30:06.382
your feelings then? By the way, isn't that the same 
year that Roosevelt died? Yes. Yeah. I remember

30:12.448 --> 30:13.109
that. Roosevelt died April 12th. Let me tell you 
about that. We

30:17.249 --> 30:25.236
were in a staff meeting in 2nd Air Force 
Headquarters.

30:28.038 --> 30:30.060
Just a daily staff meeting. I forget what day it 
was, but I remember we were about ready to break up,

30:30.080 --> 30:46.935
and here come crashing through the door one of 
Brooke Allen's aides or some captain and so forth,

30:30.080 --> 30:46.935
and his hand is teletyped to Brooke Allen. His 
comments, oh, no, Jesus, a song. He said, the

30:52.842 --> 30:55.024
president died. God, we all were just spelled, 
just struck, astounded. And then we looked at the

31:00.789 --> 31:05.793
wire and all, and just announced the death of the 
president. And we were just dumbfounded. I never

31:09.156 --> 31:10.157
will forget that. It's one of those times in your 
life, you know, that you're just something really

31:10.177 --> 31:17.243
strikes you and hits you. And I never will forget 
that. What were the feelings on base? Oh, just

31:21.196 --> 31:33.551
terrible regret and remorse and, Lord, how we pick 
up and continue with this thing, you know. It was

31:33.891 --> 31:41.640
really a shocker.

31:43.743 --> 31:46.386
A month after that, Germany was defeated. And do 
you remember your feelings finally when they

31:47.902 --> 31:52.587
signed this render?

31:55.490 --> 31:56.371
No, I don't remember. I think it was sort of a 
foregone fact that we didn't know. What about the

32:00.615 --> 32:02.757
atomic bomb? That now was another deal that we were 
amazed at. And critically, I had no idea of such a

32:07.762 --> 32:12.407
thing at the time. So, and you might say that was the 
opposite feeling about when Roosevelt died.

32:18.906 --> 32:24.994
Goodness, boy, we ain't no, this thing, the 
Japanese gotta give up. And,

32:25.014 --> 32:32.965
well this was something new, and you know, like me, 
something I never heard of before. Well, who did

32:35.128 --> 32:36.870
hear of it before? You know, you can change the 
course of physics, but again, Boy, we've got it

32:44.534 --> 32:46.876
now. This thing will be over. Relief, pride. Of 
course, later on, many people, Americans, were

32:52.642 --> 33:02.611
upset that we'd used this weapon on other humans. 
What were your feelings? I had no feeling like that

33:04.193 --> 33:08.617
whatsoever.

33:09.918 --> 33:12.921
No telling how many American boys this saved, no 
telling how many. I have no regret whatsoever to

33:17.211 --> 33:21.355
this review. Plus the fact that I think, as a matter 
of fact, there was some pluses for it. Look what we

33:26.261 --> 33:27.802
learned from this. Look how devastating this can 
be. No wonder I feel that there's just no person in

33:33.068 --> 33:39.796
his right mind can start a nuclear war. Nobody can 
win it. It's just unthinkable. And lo and behold,

33:44.526 --> 33:54.354
here now you begin to hear both the other side and 
our side think that maybe there is a thinkable

33:44.526 --> 33:54.354
nuclear war. And you know, I know a little bit about 
the development of the small nukes, tactical

33:54.975 --> 34:12.810
nukes and so forth, but once that starts, I've been 
in exercises where I commanded the Air Force

33:54.975 --> 34:12.810
components in an exercise, Desert Strike, for 
instance, which was laid on for the express

33:54.975 --> 34:12.810
purpose of starting a conventional war and having 
the capability of my fighters with nuclear bombs

34:13.735 --> 34:32.331
on them to try to experiment with two forces 
fighting one another and how would it escalate

34:13.735 --> 34:32.331
into a nuclear war. And it took about 24 hours for it 
to escalate, where we started using a nuclear

34:32.572 --> 34:38.977
bomb. Of course, we had guys playing as the 
president, you know, and the civilian forces

34:38.997 --> 34:43.101
above. But

34:44.077 --> 34:55.251
again, the dropping of that bomb,

34:44.077 --> 34:55.251
boy, I don't criticize Truman one bit. I don't 
criticize him one bit. We are finally done with war

34:58.656 --> 35:02.981
in September of 1945.

35:06.185 --> 35:09.670
What were your feelings toward a future career in 
the military? Did you ever consider maybe You'd

35:12.072 --> 35:14.076
want to get out of the military. You still were a 
reserve officer, or did you want to stay in, or just

35:14.116 --> 35:20.447
what were your feelings? Well, by this time, not 
that time, I was still a reserve officer. I was a

35:27.640 --> 35:31.026
reserve colonel.

35:31.698 --> 35:35.523
No, I was a dedicated career officer. I didn't even 
think about getting out of the service. I just

35:40.089 --> 35:43.855
wondered, my thoughts, well, what it be now.

35:46.558 --> 35:58.735
We'll shrink our Air Force and there'll be a lot of 
people getting out and we'll be pulling people

35:46.558 --> 35:58.735
back home and we'll be closing bases.

35:59.153 --> 35:59.954
Where will I go? What do I want to do? What job do I 
want?

36:05.443 --> 36:08.348
And are we going to close up this thing too fast? 
What are you going to do?

36:12.715 --> 36:15.479
So, I had no feeling about getting out of the 
service at all. It didn't sound like you were very

36:15.580 --> 36:18.304
bright though about your future. No, I began to 
think, you know, well, Now, we're going to reduce

36:22.542 --> 36:31.535
the forces also, and probably the number of 
generals required would be less, and I began to

36:22.542 --> 36:31.535
wonder, well, would I be promoted? And what job 
would be good for the purpose of my career? And I

36:37.383 --> 36:38.845
began to think about that.

36:46.957 --> 36:49.240
But I still wanted to be in the Air Force. I loved it. 
Okay. So you left in December 1945, Colorado, and

36:51.871 --> 37:06.427
then from January 1946 to December 1946,

36:51.871 --> 37:06.427
you went to Washington, D.C., headquarters of the 
Army Air Forces. Tell me about that. Was that to

37:10.172 --> 37:12.234
what you call?

37:15.157 --> 37:16.979
Oh, yeah. General Caldwell. What was your title, 
Darryl? I was head of the training branch. Oh,

37:23.360 --> 37:44.170
I remember, yeah, the first thing that hit me up 
there was we had just begun to, we got the first

37:23.360 --> 37:44.170
P-80s, the jet aircraft, and it organized a group 
of them and I recall now that's one job I loved

37:45.500 --> 37:57.193
ahead, but I didn't have a chance to, I just didn't 
get that job to get checked out in the P-80 and take

37:45.500 --> 37:57.193
over that first group. But now in the training 
branch, I've got to think about, well, how are we

37:57.794 --> 38:03.741
going to train people to fly this airplane? I've 
got to think of my training days down in Florida in

38:03.761 --> 38:08.166
AFSAT, you know, Air Force Group Flight Attack. So 
I have made it to go to paper that we've got to start a

38:08.652 --> 38:14.220
jet flying school someplace. And that's what 
generated the first jet flying school someplace

38:14.240 --> 38:22.132
in Texas out there. But we got airplanes committed 
to that base for jet flying. And of course, it was

38:29.744 --> 38:32.488
what we called a T-Bird, T-33. But the first P-80s, 
there was a squadron were allocated to a squad, and

38:37.373 --> 38:52.133
I forget where it was, but I remember Bruce 
Holloway being in on that deal, and then they were

38:37.373 --> 38:52.133
taking these airplanes, you know, they took them 
to Europe, to show them to people. In other words,

38:52.213 --> 38:55.097
the Air Force was upgrading itself to jet 
aircraft. This was a new age. Oh, yeah, I bet you

38:56.519 --> 38:58.121
were excited about that. Oh, yes, and that's, at 
least I was in on the training part of it. Yeah. So I

39:02.346 --> 39:06.672
was instrumental in getting the first training 
base set up for jet aircraft. Did you ever get to fly

39:07.360 --> 39:09.643
one? Subsequently, I did, yeah. But you wanted, 
you would have liked to command that first. Oh,

39:16.711 --> 39:19.094
goodness, everybody in the Air Force did. I bet. So

39:19.554 --> 39:25.101
there's a lot of competition there for that job. 
Oh, yeah. You know, there were guys in the Air Force

39:25.361 --> 39:36.034
that had many more victories than I. I was one of the 
biggest aces, and some of them are still fresh off a

39:25.361 --> 39:36.034
combat, you know, and like you say, I hadn't been 
flying I hadn't even been flying combat aircraft

39:36.318 --> 39:39.062
since 42. So I felt a little bit unqualified to 
raise my hand and say, I want that job. But I got a lot

39:47.333 --> 39:49.897
of satisfaction out of it. At least in the 
Pentagon, to get something generated and done,

39:50.097 --> 39:56.646
and then sit back and say, you know that you've done 
it? Boy, that's something, the Pentagon. Was it

40:01.333 --> 40:02.815
hectic in the Pentagon? These were, this was the 
big year of demobilization, 1946. Everybody, we

40:07.204 --> 40:15.794
went from 12 million man armed forces down to a 
million and a half in a year and a half, from 45 to 47.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.155
It's wrecked. Terrific military machine. It's 
wrecked. But rightfully so, I guess, at that time.

40:26.025 --> 40:27.386
So was it hectic in the Pentagon? Was it hectic in 
the Pentagon? Well, yes, but not at the tense. pace

40:32.140 --> 40:34.162
that we had during the war. You didn't have the 
urgency of everything. At least we began to relax a

40:37.205 --> 40:40.709
little. It wasn't as frustrating and hectic as 
usual. Probably a little bit more enjoyable than

40:48.397 --> 40:56.726
usual.

40:56.746 --> 41:01.371
And what would you consider your accomplishment 
during that year, getting this training base set

40:56.746 --> 41:01.371
up? than Ed Vance's typical boring staff job.

41:11.712 --> 41:23.511
I think that's when, yes, that's when I began to,

41:11.712 --> 41:23.511
the Air University The birth of the Air University 
was just about to happen. Air War College? Air War

41:27.241 --> 41:28.102
College. And schooling and education began to... 
We had a branch in the train division called that.

41:34.510 --> 41:40.398
And that's where I began, you know, in staff 
meetings, I'd listen to them talk about, well,

41:34.510 --> 41:40.398
we've got to do this, do that. And then out of that 
blossomed, you know, education and training. And

41:43.943 --> 41:51.253
the Air Force Institute of Technology, where we 
want Air Force officers to be, all of them to have

41:43.943 --> 41:51.253
college degrees. And then that old urgency came up 
again, I remember now distinctly. Gee, maybe I'll

41:56.555 --> 42:00.121
get in on this program and get my degree. And that's 
where, really, the basic,

42:00.141 --> 42:19.671
being right in the Pentagon, fortunately, I was 
right at the source of the organization of the

42:00.141 --> 42:19.671
program for allowing officers, promptly 
qualified and deserving, to go to a college of

42:20.039 --> 42:25.183
their own choice for at least two years towards 
getting a degree. And that's how I got into the

42:25.203 --> 42:32.189
program to go to Texas A&M. Why did you choose Texas 
A&M? I always wanted to go to Texas A&M. Remember me

42:36.793 --> 42:38.975
telling you why I chose Texas A&M? It had to be Texas 
A&M. And when I went down there it was about, I think

42:41.517 --> 42:49.624
it was six weeks more with me that first year I went 
down there. And today, I thank the Air Force for

42:51.781 --> 42:54.524
that. It was the greatest thing they ever did. In 
January 1947, then, you arrived at Texas A&M. But

43:02.713 --> 43:05.095
before we get to that, I want to ask you a question. 
During this time, 1946, 1947, of course, there was

43:05.135 --> 43:15.987
considerable discussion about separating the 
Air Force from the Army and making a separate and

43:05.135 --> 43:15.987
equal branch. Oh, yeah. What was your opinion on 
that? Oh, I definitely was for that. There was no

43:20.671 --> 43:29.127
doubt in my mind that the air power was what won the 
war and then here come the atomic bomb and

43:20.671 --> 43:29.127
goodnight. This stopped a complete nation of war. 
Just a bomber with a bomb in it.

43:38.604 --> 43:44.535
It had to be a separate power and I was all for that. 
Sure enough, I think it was Act of 47 when the

43:45.089 --> 43:52.798
Defense Department, and that's where, by the way, 
I eventually got my regular permission to, by the

43:45.089 --> 43:52.798
way. Okay, how did that come about, getting your 
regular commission? Well, I was at the... Because

43:55.340 --> 43:59.465
they didn't take everybody. No, well, my career 
was outstanding. I was in fighter race and had

44:01.908 --> 44:14.742
combat experience and was in mission to Moscow and 
Russia, and I was well-qualified. no doubt, and

44:15.278 --> 44:22.606
met the requirements for a full regular 
commission of the colonel in the Air Force. So they

44:22.626 --> 44:24.629
gave you a permanent? I think a permanent colonel.

44:28.433 --> 44:29.634
I bet you that made you happy. Oh, yeah. Well, you 
see, finally I reached that objective, too, that I

44:30.475 --> 44:36.002
had when I went to Flying Tigers in 1941. Here I got 
my regular commission finally. It took me six

44:39.065 --> 44:43.210
years, but I did it. I think we're ready to start 
here at Texas A&M. Do you want to take a break? Yeah,

44:49.946 --> 44:57.357
let's take a

44:49.946 --> 44:57.357
break. Now we can continue and discuss your two 
years and five months getting a degree at Texas

44:57.377 --> 45:07.893
A&M. Now let's put on tape, like we were talking 
over lunch. Let's put on tape. How did the

45:14.510 --> 45:24.607
university ever let you go to school on a four year 
program and accomplish this in two years and five

45:14.510 --> 45:24.607
months? Well, Terry, the whole program was a 
result of the study of the Air Force by the Air Force

45:24.948 --> 45:39.994
Institute of Technology to try to upgrade the 
education of all the regular Air Force officers.

45:40.278 --> 45:43.683
in particular those who hadn't had a college 
degree. The objective was that they'd love,

45:43.803 --> 45:48.109
ideally, to also have a college degree. And they 
met the criteria, so they approved it, but they

45:49.190 --> 45:56.961
could not afford to allow more than two years. This 
oriented primarily to a two-year college man,

45:57.081 --> 46:02.048
give him another two years so he'd have a degree. 
The objective of trying to give a man four years to

46:06.535 --> 46:18.051
go to college was a little bit unreasonable, but 
they'd at least give a person that was properly

46:06.535 --> 46:18.051
qualified and obviously properly motivated, 
give him a chance to have at least two years of

46:06.535 --> 46:18.051
college. It would still improve his education. So 
they allowed me to go, and when they approved it,

46:20.174 --> 46:29.667
they didn't assume I would get a degree. They just 
assumed I'd end up with two years of college. Upon

46:32.891 --> 46:34.213
reporting to I had the objective of an electrical 
engineering degree. And upon reporting to the

46:41.518 --> 46:47.494
school and talking with the proper officials, I 
told them I wanted to get an electrical

46:41.518 --> 46:47.494
engineering degree.
