WEBVTT

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:16.187
In general, would you say that, as you look back, that A&M students treat each other with reasonable fairness, equity?

00:00:16.728 --> 00:00:20.233
At most part, yes, but one thing

00:00:20.213 --> 00:00:31.467
that I was really, this year, that I would say a lot and try to focus on was that when you're here, there's a lot of different groups on campus.

00:00:31.487 --> 00:00:33.330
And you don't talk very well about some of those.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.538
For example, the Halls don't always talk great about the core.

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.223
Definitely not about Greeks.

00:00:44.264 --> 00:00:49.090
But I think it's a hypocritical thing when we go outside, we graduate,

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.358
and I see somebody with an Aggie ring and I go up to them and say, you're an Aggie, we should talk.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.382
Why can't you always be like that here?

00:00:56.785 --> 00:01:01.235
I mean, it's a big hypocritical thing, in my opinion, to do something like that.

00:01:02.337 --> 00:01:05.003
But in general, I think we get along well enough.

00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:19.413
Now in class, no faculty I presume ever made any difference in the way they treated core, non-core, male, female and so forth.

00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:21.118
Yeah.

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:30.863
Your junior year you're getting more active in all this, and when did you learn that you were admitted to engineering fully?

00:01:31.844 --> 00:01:33.327
Spring of your sophomore year?

00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:34.770
I would say so, yeah.

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:37.555
By that time I knew I was in and I was pretty happy.

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:38.476
How did you learn?

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:39.798
Did you get a phone call, a letter?

00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:42.721
I got a letter that said you had been admitted into the upper level.

00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:47.927
And you then select what specialty in engineering?

00:01:47.947 --> 00:01:48.407
Electrical.

00:01:48.427 --> 00:01:48.828
Electrical.

00:01:49.068 --> 00:01:50.209
And that had been your goal always?

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.070
Uh-huh.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.370
All right.

00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:54.594
And your grades are going up.

00:01:54.954 --> 00:01:56.676
They're still up there.

00:01:56.776 --> 00:02:04.605
Did somebody, did you then find somebody in electrical engineering that you would turn to for advice and counsel?

00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:05.466
No.

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:09.049
Ooh, I see that's something that's different now from what it used to be.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.375
And your GPA has moved on up.

00:02:16.976 --> 00:02:21.580
Your junior year then you get more involved in student activities and so forth.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.880
Yes.

00:02:22.721 --> 00:02:24.883
That year I become R.J. delegate for Walton.

00:02:26.164 --> 00:02:29.407
I become public relations for Mexican Student Association.

00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:30.188
I'm still a reporter.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.951
I get involved heavily more in Bonfire.

00:02:35.332 --> 00:02:36.273
What did you do?

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:37.355
You're still loading?

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:43.544
Yeah, we're still loading, but since I'm a junior now, I do a little bit different things here and there.

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:50.814
I help with the fuck sticks, and I help fuck stick the trucks, and what else did I do?

00:02:53.357 --> 00:02:55.300
I was just more involved with campus and with Walton.

00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:59.466
And again, about how long, how many weeks, Bonfire?

00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:02.094
Six, seven, eight, I can't remember.

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:06.099
It was at least two, two and a half months.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.681
And every day or just weekends?

00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:08.202
Just weekends.

00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:10.345
Saturday and Sunday?

00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:14.410
Sometimes during the week when we started building Bonfire itself.

00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:17.494
And that was a year that it fell in 99.

00:03:19.597 --> 00:03:22.220
Where were you when you heard the news?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.504
It was a very interesting story because the night it fell,

00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:30.718
That morning, I had one class.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.661
I didn't have any homework to do.

00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:33.783
I had finished everything.

00:03:35.205 --> 00:03:37.828
And there was this one freshman from back home that was here.

00:03:37.848 --> 00:03:39.671
And I had talked to him for a while.

00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:41.954
And we took him out twice to load.

00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:45.058
So he had yet to see how a bonfire was being built.

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.361
And that night, I said, hey, his name was Juan.

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:50.385
I was like, I'd like to take you out there and see how it's all going.

00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:52.548
I mean, you're not doing anything tonight, neither am I.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.771
And he kind of agreed.

00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:57.415
So I put on my clothes.

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:00.099
And I was ready.

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.943
And I saw him sitting down and he's like, you know, I'm watching.

00:04:03.363 --> 00:04:10.313
We started watching The Devil's Advocate, which was kind of ironic.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.574
And he said, I don't want to go anymore.

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:12.916
And Walton had already left.

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:16.841
And I saw him and I was like, oh, you gotta be kidding.

00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:19.104
It's like, I'm already dressed.

00:04:19.124 --> 00:04:19.765
And he didn't want to go.

00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:22.970
So I decided to just get back into my clothes and go to sleep.

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:24.752
And I remember going to bed.

00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:27.484
And I don't remember anything about that night.

00:04:27.524 --> 00:04:30.789
I just went to bed and I fell asleep kind of, you know, very happily.

00:04:32.192 --> 00:04:35.337
I remember waking up the next morning because there was a phone call.

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.605
And we're in the loft and our phone is down there, so we didn't want to get up.

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:47.699
We just heard the machine and it said something like, it was my roommate's sister saying, I hope you guys are okay.

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:49.422
I hope there's nothing wrong with you or whatever.

00:04:49.582 --> 00:04:50.724
And she was calling from where?

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:51.465
From Austin.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.817
And we just ignored it.

00:04:56.837 --> 00:05:01.387
I had an 8 o'clock that morning, or a 9, 8 or 9, soccer class.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.062
And then another call, another friend called from here, from A&M, and she said, she's calling to see if you guys are okay.

00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:09.645
I'm just worried about you, blah, blah, blah.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.133
Then my roommate says, something happened.

00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:18.925
And we get up, and I start getting down, and I hear the door knock.

00:05:19.206 --> 00:05:21.728
My suite mate coming in, he's like, did you guys hear already?

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:23.190
I was like, what?

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.271
He's like, bonfire fell.

00:05:25.432 --> 00:05:25.852
I was like, what?

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:27.514
He's like, yeah, it's on TV.

00:05:28.134 --> 00:05:31.718
I remember turning on the TV, and I saw a stack lying over.

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:33.540
But it didn't hit me.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.523
I was just like, huh.

00:05:36.543 --> 00:05:37.323
That's very weird.

00:05:39.165 --> 00:05:41.828
And then my roommate got up, and we're like, let's go see what happened.

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.069
So we ride over.

00:05:44.365 --> 00:05:51.613
And we saw the conferences and whatever, not the conference, the President speak and Dr. Bowen speak.

00:05:52.454 --> 00:05:55.337
By that time, I still hadn't, like it still hadn't hit me.

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:02.946
So I went back and I went to class and some of my friends looked at me and they were like, they sighed with relief because they knew how involved I was.

00:06:03.907 --> 00:06:07.511
I went back over there with the first help out crew while we went over.

00:06:08.852 --> 00:06:11.115
And we started helping out with the logs and all that stuff.

00:06:11.973 --> 00:06:12.914
And about what time?

00:06:12.934 --> 00:06:14.056
I would say about 10.

00:06:14.076 --> 00:06:15.257
In the morning.

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:21.246
By that time, I was getting more understanding of what was going on.

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:22.908
It was starting to hit me.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.115
And then I remember being there for a while, and I had to go to another class, my math class.

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:30.538
And by that time, I was getting really upset.

00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:35.605
It was pissing me off that a lot of other teachers had already canceled classes, and this guy had not.

00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:38.709
And I was getting really, it was getting to me.

00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:41.473
And I went back one more time.

00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:46.257
By that time, I kind of fully understood what was going on because I was so close to the stack.

00:06:47.038 --> 00:06:50.963
And my first two thoughts were, can you imagine if I was trapped?

00:06:51.964 --> 00:06:54.387
The anguish that I would be going through.

00:06:55.549 --> 00:07:03.700
And the second thing that has just hit my mind was those parents of those students that have already died, how they must be feeling right now.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.622
And I thought about my parents.

00:07:06.344 --> 00:07:08.973
I made the mistake of not calling them until later on that night.

00:07:09.815 --> 00:07:15.675
My mom would tell me that she saw my dad turn white because they were calling me and they couldn't get me.

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:18.885
And I made that mistake of not calling them.

00:07:19.557 --> 00:07:26.468
When you were out there in the work area, did you see any victim?

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.937
You didn't hear or see any human noises?

00:07:32.257 --> 00:07:35.002
By that time they didn't let us even go close to that.

00:07:35.222 --> 00:07:36.163
Oh, oh, oh.

00:07:36.183 --> 00:07:36.324
Okay.

00:07:36.344 --> 00:07:37.946
And that's why I didn't see anything.

00:07:39.148 --> 00:07:39.709
Okay.

00:07:40.195 --> 00:07:44.282
What were your friends, what were they doing?

00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:45.423
What was their attitude?

00:07:45.463 --> 00:07:50.131
Some of them had been there, but they had left because they were told not to go there.

00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:54.878
And some of them were just really sad.

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:58.344
One of them was going to be at Brown Pot that night, so he was out there.

00:07:58.384 --> 00:08:00.267
And I got to talk to him for a while.

00:08:01.168 --> 00:08:04.093
He did see a lot of the bodies and victims.

00:08:05.963 --> 00:08:11.290
Were you all surprised, you and your friends, were you all surprised that the bonfire collapsed?

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.071
Definitely.

00:08:12.211 --> 00:08:13.332
It was a shock.

00:08:14.334 --> 00:08:19.080
And I remember the day after so well because we were sitting down.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.602
It was such a dark day.

00:08:21.943 --> 00:08:28.832
It was a cloudy day and we were talking about it and we were like, wow, such a dark day that happened.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.251
You know, it goes with the mood of this.

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:35.296
And after that, I think everything has changed so much in this campus.

00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:39.701
Did you know any, were you acquainted with any of the?

00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:42.544
Not so much acquainted, but one of them would load so much with us.

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:45.307
He was in Squadron 17, Jerry Self.

00:08:46.849 --> 00:08:47.910
Self, S-E-L-F?

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:48.251
Yes.

00:08:49.893 --> 00:08:51.414
And we knew him.

00:08:53.497 --> 00:08:59.123
And he's the only guy that has ever gotten a load shirt, not being in Wong.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.258
When he passed away they gave it to his family to put in the coffin.

00:09:03.398 --> 00:09:04.561
It was very nice.

00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:16.470
As you and your friends have observed what the decision made about Bonfire, how do you feel about that decision?

00:09:16.568 --> 00:09:23.743
See, the big thing was that with my position, I had to be part of the steering committee, the one that oversaw everything.

00:09:24.324 --> 00:09:25.045
As part of RHA?

00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:27.430
Yes, sir.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:35.607
So from the beginning of this year, I've been so much into it, a big force, because in my opinion,

00:09:36.464 --> 00:09:40.708
A&M, the heart of A&M are the residence halls and the Corps of Cadets.

00:09:41.589 --> 00:09:48.015
But the Corps only has about close to 2,000 people as compared to the 9,000 that the on-campus has.

00:09:48.676 --> 00:09:51.879
And there's so much work and everything that goes from the on-campus people.

00:09:54.521 --> 00:10:00.767
So everything that has to go on has to be part of the residence halls.

00:10:01.648 --> 00:10:04.851
So that to me is the most important aspect of this campus.

00:10:06.232 --> 00:10:12.181
So that was a big push for us was to try to get a bonfire back because since I was a freshman, I've seen how much it's declined.

00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:22.376
A lot of people keep saying that it's not the defining spirit and have to disagree because if they look at it now, there's nothing close to what there was even two years ago.

00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:31.429
If you could have been the decision maker, what would you have decided about bonfire in the future?

00:10:33.051 --> 00:10:34.213
Would we have a bonfire?

00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:39.278
And if so, what kind of dimensions would it be?

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.665
I would have one with the dimensions that they wanted to do them this year.

00:10:46.288 --> 00:10:46.969
A single stack?

00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:47.810
A single stack.

00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:50.213
All the logs touching the ground.

00:10:52.476 --> 00:10:53.918
I would kind of go with what they had now.

00:10:54.599 --> 00:11:02.149
And I know it was a lot of trouble trying to get insurance and everything like that, but I really do believe there is a way to make it safe.

00:11:02.169 --> 00:11:06.495
But on the other hand, I also believe that our bonfire, what we know, died

00:11:07.252 --> 00:11:08.333
in 99 when it fell.

00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:11.717
What do we do in the future then?

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:28.357
Right now, this is one thing that I decided to do, was make up this committee under RHA that was going to plan events, not to take over a bonfire, but to look to get people involved with so many different events.

00:11:29.258 --> 00:11:30.500
It's called the Go Big Committee.

00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:31.741
Go Big?

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:32.382
Go Big.

00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:35.574
And it's in full force right now, and they're playing so much.

00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:40.253
And I'm really proud of those guys, because I put in different chairs to Jared.

00:11:41.317 --> 00:11:42.642
I put four guys and one girl.

00:11:44.596 --> 00:11:46.959
And they're doing such a great job that people are getting so pumped up.

00:11:47.059 --> 00:11:48.020
People want to be part of this.

00:11:48.681 --> 00:11:51.844
So they'll have something in the next fall to look forward to.

00:11:52.766 --> 00:12:00.294
And so far I'm looking at great ideas and everything that I'm kind of proud that I'm going to leave and actually leave happy.

00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:09.405
All right, back to, let's see, your third year you become an engineering student

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.572
Your grades start going up.

00:12:11.892 --> 00:12:14.936
By that time they're kind of leveling again.

00:12:16.057 --> 00:12:17.138
Okay.

00:12:17.158 --> 00:12:25.268
And you're still, are you still increasing your study efforts or did that level off?

00:12:25.288 --> 00:12:28.311
Kind of leveled off to moderately going up and down.

00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:29.593
It's just a little wavering thing.

00:12:30.193 --> 00:12:36.861
As you look back now, not far from commencement, what were the key courses

00:12:37.955 --> 00:12:39.478
for you at Texas A&M?

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:41.541
What were the most important courses you've had?

00:12:41.581 --> 00:12:44.967
My electrical engineering 214, which was a circuit one.

00:12:45.669 --> 00:12:45.849
What?

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.137
Electrical engineering 214, which was the first kind of circuit course.

00:12:50.277 --> 00:12:51.018
Circuit course.

00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:51.218
Okay.

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:52.982
So I didn't understand the circuit.

00:12:53.242 --> 00:12:53.603
Okay.

00:12:53.623 --> 00:12:55.145
Which I kind of learned about the circuits.

00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:57.229
That has to be one of the most important ones.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:05.111
my electrical engineering 322 class, which is electromagnetics, which kind of helped me out a lot.

00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:09.037
I would say those two are kind of very important.

00:13:09.057 --> 00:13:13.223
And were there some other teachers that you now would want to pat on the back?

00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:19.373
No.

00:13:19.654 --> 00:13:24.381
All right.

00:13:27.314 --> 00:13:34.781
After you got involved in engineering, did you go back home and have the same kind of job after your?

00:13:34.801 --> 00:13:35.822
No, that year I didn't go home.

00:13:36.303 --> 00:13:37.204
I stayed here for the summer.

00:13:37.924 --> 00:13:39.166
Now this is your fifth year?

00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:42.229
Uh-huh.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.611
Okay.

00:13:44.631 --> 00:13:46.993
How did you get to be the president of RHA?

00:13:47.254 --> 00:13:48.815
How does one campaign for that job?

00:13:49.156 --> 00:13:56.663
Well, first, after my junior year, for my senior year, I ran for president of Walton.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.655
and that was

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:04.009
It's not a big job, but it was a hard job because it was the first year that there was no bonfire.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:15.501
And our hall became like the White House of this campus to where we were so still full of energy and full of spirit while everybody else was just, this is a weird word to use, dying around us.

00:14:16.342 --> 00:14:19.825
People weren't there doing the stuff they used to because they knew there wasn't a bonfire that year.

00:14:21.387 --> 00:14:23.749
So excitement and unity wasn't there.

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:28.354
Our hall, under our leadership, stayed up there.

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:31.418
and they still did so much stuff and everybody looked up to us.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.768
And that year RHA started losing all of its members.

00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:41.812
It was just a bad year for RHA that year.

00:14:41.872 --> 00:14:44.976
The relationships with it were just going bad.

00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:55.910
They lost three out of their five executives and most of their pod members, board of directors.

00:14:58.173 --> 00:14:58.273
And

00:14:59.063 --> 00:15:02.008
That year I got even more involved than before.

00:15:02.028 --> 00:15:06.216
I was still in Manners, I was still in MSA.

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:08.840
I was going over some other clubs.

00:15:10.082 --> 00:15:14.570
I became part of Aggie Spirits for Unity, Pro Traditions.

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:22.945
We were looking at keep the fire burning when it was coming out because I still believed we could still do a bonfire.

00:15:25.203 --> 00:15:27.168
I became leader in pro-traditions.

00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:29.433
I became one of the student leaders.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.692
Of course President Walton and all that other stuff and we still saw RHA going down.

00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:41.841
In my opinion it was going down and they were having so many internal problems.

00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:44.427
So after that year

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:51.458
I had been talking or talking to some people about becoming president or trying to run for president.

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:55.063
And I knew there was three other people that wanted to do it as well.

00:15:56.726 --> 00:16:00.411
And at one point I said, no, I don't want to do it anymore.

00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:02.434
I was getting kind of tired of a lot of stuff.

00:16:03.956 --> 00:16:05.478
But I had some people say, hey, do it, you know.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.985
So I got to a point where I said, OK, I'm going to run for president of RJ.

00:16:11.647 --> 00:16:15.713
And from what I remember, nobody wanted to be part of it.

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:19.604
My VP of administration said, if you do it, I'm going to do it with you.

00:16:20.505 --> 00:16:22.687
My vice president of program said, you do it, I do it.

00:16:23.448 --> 00:16:25.089
And this other girl said the same thing, you do it, I do it.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:29.693
And then I had some other board people that wanted to be part of the board that said, if you do it, I'm going to go in.

00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:32.015
So after a while, I just had to do it.

00:16:32.456 --> 00:16:36.679
So you had a slate that ran with you.

00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:39.262
I went in and I kind of inherited an organization that had nothing.

00:16:41.163 --> 00:16:42.625
How did y'all campaign?

00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:45.007
Did you knock on doors?

00:16:45.527 --> 00:16:46.628
Well, the only way

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.637
where we can campaign is on campus.

00:16:49.418 --> 00:16:52.923
And when we started this, those other three people that wanted to do it dropped out.

00:16:54.244 --> 00:16:55.746
So I was running on the post.

00:16:56.007 --> 00:17:00.613
So I just helped out my friend, Boo Boo, who was running for your leader with his campaign.

00:17:01.374 --> 00:17:03.797
So I really didn't need a campaign because nobody else was running against me.

00:17:03.997 --> 00:17:05.059
Now, how did you know Boo Boo?

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.083
From loading back in our freshman year.

00:17:08.383 --> 00:17:09.405
Now, he's a civilian.

00:17:09.745 --> 00:17:11.487
Yeah.

00:17:11.507 --> 00:17:15.012
And you and I know, anyone listening to this tape might not know, Boo Boo

00:17:15.515 --> 00:17:18.842
is a large, young, black man.

00:17:18.862 --> 00:17:19.242
Yes, he is.

00:17:19.563 --> 00:17:20.184
Very large.

00:17:20.585 --> 00:17:23.010
And how, when did you all get acquainted?

00:17:24.052 --> 00:17:26.136
Probably our freshman, sophomore year.

00:17:26.156 --> 00:17:32.208
And his name is, is it two words, B-O-O space B-O-O, or is it one word?

00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:34.673
How does he write Boo Boo?

00:17:35.494 --> 00:17:36.797
He does B-O-O

00:17:38.127 --> 00:17:39.031
Space BO.

00:17:39.372 --> 00:17:41.441
So it's capital B, capital B. Yeah.

00:17:41.742 --> 00:17:42.445
What's his last name?

00:17:42.827 --> 00:17:43.148
Davis.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.237
Boo Boo Davis from where?

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:45.759
Do you know?

00:17:46.462 --> 00:17:47.547
He was born in Africa.

00:17:48.691 --> 00:17:51.274
but he's from Prairie View, Texas.

00:17:51.294 --> 00:17:52.475
And what's his major, do you know?

00:17:53.677 --> 00:17:58.503
He was math and I don't know what else he became and now he's RPTS.

00:18:00.044 --> 00:18:01.025
What's RPTS?

00:18:01.646 --> 00:18:07.313
Recreation and parks and something like that, tourism and sciences.

00:18:07.633 --> 00:18:15.322
Alright, so you are elected and you served this 2001-2002 year.

00:18:15.502 --> 00:18:18.546
And the interesting thing was

00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:25.067
I got in there and like I said, there was one person I was staying.

00:18:26.129 --> 00:18:27.672
Everybody that had been part of it left.

00:18:29.074 --> 00:18:34.623
The relationships to their groups were not there.

00:18:36.606 --> 00:18:39.030
And I came in and there was only one person staying over.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:44.239
He was a director of service and he became the vice president for programs.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.963
Everybody else, the other

00:18:48.665 --> 00:18:55.836
Out of the four VPs, three of them ran on a post as well because I was going to do it.

00:18:56.857 --> 00:19:05.571
And the funny thing is that since not all of them decided to do it with me and write in, they had to throw those elections out and we had to have a special election.

00:19:05.591 --> 00:19:06.853
So it was a big deal at first.

00:19:07.974 --> 00:19:10.318
And then finally we had those three.

00:19:10.923 --> 00:19:18.534
There was only one position that two people ran for it, and I talked to the other person and I said, hey, if either of you lose, would you be willing to do the other VP?

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:19.115
And they said yes.

00:19:19.916 --> 00:19:25.284
And the funny thing is that that one person that lost, who became vice president of operations, will be the next RJ president.

00:19:28.329 --> 00:19:32.254
So we did that, and we had a few people wanting to do board of directors.

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:35.479
And I remember it was a hard summer and a hard

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:43.129
rest of the semester from that my senior year so I went out trying to recruit people to be part of our organization.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.115
Now did y'all have a kind of an office?

00:19:47.135 --> 00:19:48.717
Yes it's in Colesville.

00:19:48.737 --> 00:19:52.863
In Colesville and is there a staff person there to help y'all?

00:19:53.183 --> 00:20:01.435
Yeah there was a brand new position called the coordinator of leadership training and our advisor his name is Craig Rotter.

00:20:01.916 --> 00:20:02.757
Craig Rogers?

00:20:02.817 --> 00:20:03.117
Rotter.

00:20:03.438 --> 00:20:04.960
Rotter how do you spell it do you know?

00:20:07.049 --> 00:20:09.431
R-O-T-T-E-R. R-O-T-T-E-R.

00:20:11.594 --> 00:20:14.196
Describe him and his...

00:20:14.216 --> 00:20:19.702
He is going in for his third degree, for his doctorate.

00:20:21.023 --> 00:20:28.271
He graduated his undergrad in 92, came back and I don't remember when his second one was.

00:20:29.552 --> 00:20:31.074
He's been kind of really involved.

00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:32.015
He knows a lot of people here.

00:20:33.376 --> 00:20:35.098
He was teaching in the Ag

00:20:39.095 --> 00:20:40.879
Ag education, Ag department.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.483
Was he a civilian student?

00:20:42.703 --> 00:20:42.884
Yeah.

00:20:43.746 --> 00:20:45.129
He lived on, did he live on campus?

00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:46.191
No, he never lived on campus.

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:46.953
He lived off campus.

00:20:48.055 --> 00:20:48.857
He's never lived on it.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.185
And he's really wise.

00:20:52.325 --> 00:20:53.448
He's really helped us a lot.

00:20:54.069 --> 00:20:55.312
He really cares about the students here.

00:20:55.352 --> 00:20:56.715
He goes out there and

00:20:57.269 --> 00:21:01.959
works till like 11 at night, goes home, and he just puts out so much time.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.030
Right, so your major problem at the start is to get things going again, is that right?

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.234
Yeah, to start from pretty much scratch.

00:21:09.615 --> 00:21:12.722
And so what did you do to make that work?

00:21:12.742 --> 00:21:18.113
Right after the banquet, when I officially became president, I went right to work.

00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:24.418
Getting to know the people from the Corps, the student body president, MSC.

00:21:25.239 --> 00:21:28.263
Like I just went out and I started building these relationships already.

00:21:29.265 --> 00:21:34.993
This summer all I did was go to meetings and I get to know the advisor, Craig.

00:21:35.653 --> 00:21:37.536
I met with him probably every single day.

00:21:37.516 --> 00:21:47.848
and I met with Skyler Hauser, which was the student body president for this year, the five Yale leaders, the people from the MSC, Greek, I mean I went all over the place.

00:21:48.689 --> 00:21:55.477
We got this concert started that was for All You Night, because All You Night got rained out this year.

00:21:56.478 --> 00:21:59.662
So that concert became the focal point this year.

00:22:00.162 --> 00:22:02.325
Then I had this, what I call the big meeting,

00:22:02.575 --> 00:22:09.985
where I got all the leaders of the dorms, got them together, explained to them what was going to go on this year, what we were expecting, and everything like that.

00:22:10.025 --> 00:22:20.620
And I just, I would like to say I worked my ass off to where now I saw people ran for the positions.

00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:24.626
There's about 30 people wanting to get a board of directors spot.

00:22:25.647 --> 00:22:28.711
When I did it, I could barely get five people to do it.

00:22:29.072 --> 00:22:30.574
I had to go out and recruit people.

00:22:31.229 --> 00:22:32.651
and ask them to be if they wanted to.

00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:34.653
I mean, it was just so hard.

00:22:34.693 --> 00:22:37.476
And now the relationships are there.

00:22:37.676 --> 00:22:42.902
I mean, for the first time, halls are acting.

00:22:43.523 --> 00:22:46.807
Not only are they doing stuff within the hall, but they're doing halls with other halls.

00:22:47.568 --> 00:22:50.151
Southside is doing stuff with Northside for the first time ever.

00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:57.099
Northside and, I mean, court and residence halls have a great relationship for the first time ever.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.763
SGA and RHA are better than they've ever been.

00:23:01.975 --> 00:23:06.180
So, I mean it's been a really hard semester and I was, I like to say I'm burned out.

00:23:06.981 --> 00:23:12.969
When Vice President Colas has a gathering of key student leaders, who is in that group?

00:23:14.391 --> 00:23:15.192
Sutherland?

00:23:15.212 --> 00:23:15.853
Mm-hmm.

00:23:15.873 --> 00:23:17.134
Vice President Sutherland?

00:23:17.155 --> 00:23:17.375
Mm-hmm.

00:23:18.817 --> 00:23:18.917
Okay.

00:23:18.937 --> 00:23:25.285
They have Student Body President, R.J. President, Corps Commander, M.S.E.

00:23:25.305 --> 00:23:25.846
President.

00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:29.991
That meeting is called the SLAC, Student Leaders Advisory Council.

00:23:31.355 --> 00:23:34.558
And they're about maybe 20, 14 to 20 people.

00:23:35.599 --> 00:23:37.821
But mostly it's the head of the highest organizations.

00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:43.826
All the fraternities, the head of the interfraternity, and they have four different ones.

00:23:44.627 --> 00:23:47.009
And then some other, there's about 14 people.

00:23:47.169 --> 00:23:49.271
But they're all the highest.

00:23:49.692 --> 00:23:55.677
Which student leadership position has the greatest authority or greatest influence?

00:23:55.697 --> 00:23:58.780
Actually, in my own opinion, I think I ranked them.

00:23:59.283 --> 00:24:00.985
the way I think it is.

00:24:01.786 --> 00:24:04.410
Student body president is at the top.

00:24:05.471 --> 00:24:07.814
I mean, she represents the whole student body.

00:24:08.515 --> 00:24:11.940
And then second and third, I still have them.

00:24:12.661 --> 00:24:24.176
It's either RHA president and corps commander because they are the two biggest parts of this campus and the two biggest organizations by far with the most authority of what's going on.

00:24:24.917 --> 00:24:28.682
And the reason why I have them, I have RHA actually on top and that's because

00:24:29.995 --> 00:24:38.428
the president of RHA overlooks overseas close to 9,000 students as opposed to the 2,000 that the core has.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:49.906
After that I would say MSC president because that group has so much money and so much influence.

00:24:50.487 --> 00:24:52.230
And then the other spot is the head Yale leader.

00:24:53.152 --> 00:24:57.859
They don't have a lot of change, a lot of power, but they have so much influence on this campus.

00:24:58.852 --> 00:25:11.308
Now, the students that are left out by their own choice are those who live off campus who aren't

00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:13.185
affiliated with anything?

00:25:13.886 --> 00:25:14.307
Pretty much.

00:25:14.607 --> 00:25:19.535
I would say they're the ones that are most left out and don't have the experience that on campus people have.

00:25:19.555 --> 00:25:21.497
Because being on campus, you have the experience.

00:25:21.517 --> 00:25:22.579
Everything's around you.

00:25:22.599 --> 00:25:22.919
Oh, sure.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.882
You have more of a chance to be more involved.

00:25:25.283 --> 00:25:33.154
But even those people decide not to do stuff, and I think they just throw away four great years of their life because there's so much more than just going and studying.

00:25:34.276 --> 00:25:38.342
I mean, everybody probably will graduate somehow if they put a little bit of effort.

00:25:38.761 --> 00:25:41.745
but you'll never have that opportunity to come back and say, I did this.

00:25:43.888 --> 00:25:46.132
What were the major problems you ran into?

00:25:46.432 --> 00:25:47.213
Oh, there were so many.

00:25:48.295 --> 00:25:55.926
One of the big problems this year, I don't know if you might have heard, we had this big thing about the American flag on campus.

00:25:57.374 --> 00:26:02.682
where they thought we were banning, RHA was banning the American flag when the September 11 attacks happened.

00:26:03.724 --> 00:26:12.137
When all we were doing, there was, there's this rule in the handbook of the rest of the side that they don't want you to put stuff outside of your window for fear that you might fall off or something.

00:26:12.197 --> 00:26:15.102
Everything inside you, because it's right there, that's fine.

00:26:16.524 --> 00:26:24.276
And somebody brought up a resolution and we say we were, we're against the resolution how it was written, but it became a national deal.

00:26:24.931 --> 00:26:30.018
were Aggies from all over the nation, all over the world were calling us communists.

00:26:30.038 --> 00:26:34.844
And that brought our group a lot closer to each other because everybody was attacking us.

00:26:35.204 --> 00:26:36.426
I had a lot of personal attacks.

00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:46.800
And one of the goals that I had said was I was going to bring controversy, positive or negative, to RHA because it was so dead from the year before.

00:26:47.561 --> 00:26:50.905
And that was much more than I ever expected because I had emails that said,

00:26:52.285 --> 00:26:56.650
I think you're a communist, personally, and some of the people that were really rude.

00:26:57.171 --> 00:27:10.127
One that I will never forget was somebody sent me an email after I had sent a response that said, we're not against the flag, we're against the resolution, and we're all Aggies, and we're pro-USA and all that stuff.

00:27:10.587 --> 00:27:14.071
I sent out a response.

00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:20.419
He sent me one back and said, the first word was Jose, after he had written to my name.

00:27:20.787 --> 00:27:22.008
And he said, you're a great liar.

00:27:22.509 --> 00:27:24.371
You would be great for the Democratic Party.

00:27:25.492 --> 00:27:27.274
And it was just so funny that he said Democratic Party.

00:27:27.334 --> 00:27:29.676
He didn't say a party or anything, but he said the Democratic Party.

00:27:29.937 --> 00:27:31.879
And you didn't say Jorge, you said Jose.

00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:33.240
Yeah, that's what he wrote it to.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.261
Oh, oh, oh.

00:27:34.521 --> 00:27:41.068
He emailed to my account, which said Jorge, but his first line was Jose.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.833
And these people that had mean things to say

00:27:46.252 --> 00:27:49.377
Was most of it on email, or did nobody?

00:27:49.597 --> 00:27:57.168
Well, a lot of people said they heard a lot of the radio stations, like in even the newspapers in Dallas and Austin.

00:27:57.629 --> 00:28:05.340
They were calling us, one of the funny ones, we were being called faggies, and the communists, and people hated us.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.461
And that was a big deal.

00:28:07.902 --> 00:28:09.545
Like we really got on the map.

00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:13.773
Alright, and then if you needed advice on any of those matters, you turned to?

00:28:14.133 --> 00:28:16.257
Craig, once in a time.

00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:16.517
Alright.

00:28:16.538 --> 00:28:23.570
Did anybody either at the beginning of your year or during the year call you in and give, tell you to do or not to do something?

00:28:24.752 --> 00:28:25.313
No.

00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:28.138
They, people always had like, maybe you should do this, but

00:28:28.827 --> 00:28:31.230
When I went in, I said I wasn't going to be anybody's puppet.

00:28:32.171 --> 00:28:37.997
You know, I was there to represent our on-campus students, what I thought was correct.

00:28:38.578 --> 00:28:40.580
And I never did stuff that I thought was right.

00:28:41.061 --> 00:28:44.104
I would always think about the campus and how this campus has changed.

00:28:44.965 --> 00:28:48.569
And if somebody said something, I would say, we'll see what the students want.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.013
If the students want another bonfire off campus, we're going to support it.

00:28:52.974 --> 00:28:55.257
What about other problems?

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.029
that you had to cope with?

00:28:57.331 --> 00:29:00.876
Of course, getting over a lot of the old thoughts.

00:29:01.632 --> 00:29:27.133
old bonfire thoughts because this place is had so much so many people thinking like in the old days bonfire days and even though it's been like two three years it still seems like it's been such a long time a lot of those thoughts and having to explain to a lot of my friends what our plan was and how we're representing them with bonfire every day i had to explain to like 10 different people our ideas and what i was going for and

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.901
It just burned me out.

00:29:29.941 --> 00:29:35.668
It just tired me out having to explain to so many people my thoughts and what I wanted to do and why I thought it was right.

00:29:35.768 --> 00:29:38.231
Did people come to your room to bother you some?

00:29:38.771 --> 00:29:39.292
Sometimes.

00:29:40.313 --> 00:29:42.996
I mean, I always had people going up there and going like, what do you think of this?

00:29:43.096 --> 00:29:46.980
And the phone calls also got to me at times.

00:29:48.042 --> 00:29:57.272
Especially during that flag thing because I would have the texts in and so many newspapers calling all the time wanting interviews.

00:29:59.176 --> 00:30:00.357
At one point I was really tired.

00:30:01.398 --> 00:30:04.822
What were your proudest moments, happiest?

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:12.190
Right, I would say the other day that I went to the RHA office and I saw the application for board of directors.

00:30:12.751 --> 00:30:16.014
When I had nobody wanting to do it, I saw about 30 people wanting to do it.

00:30:16.775 --> 00:30:17.216
That's one.

00:30:17.656 --> 00:30:22.281
The other thing is seeing the impact we have made.

00:30:22.261 --> 00:30:35.656
and seeing how much people respect RHA because everywhere I go now, we can't do anything without RHA's approval because I think now everybody knows that if on campus people get pissed, it's pretty much down.

00:30:36.357 --> 00:30:39.540
You won't have that thing going on because they'll be against it.

00:30:40.982 --> 00:30:48.370
During your year of RHA leadership, how often did you have any contact with President Bowen?

00:30:50.189 --> 00:30:56.061
I had to go to a lot of his dinners and stuff like that, meetings that he had to be there.

00:30:56.121 --> 00:31:08.525
And I would say a proud moment, or not a proud moment, but something that I could be proud of is that that man meets so many people, that he knows me by name.

00:31:09.948 --> 00:31:12.012
And that's something that I guess I could be proud of.

00:31:13.223 --> 00:31:15.436
You know you've done a good thing when they know you by your name.

00:31:15.677 --> 00:31:19.036
And how often did you encounter Vice President Southern?

00:31:19.096 --> 00:31:20.263
That's a lot of times.
