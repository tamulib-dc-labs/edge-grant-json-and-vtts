00:06.275 --> 00:20.920
Well,

00:06.275 --> 00:20.920
what do you feel probably was the most important 
thing that you did while you were at A&M, the most

00:06.275 --> 00:20.920
important of all the things we've discussed, that 
had the greatest? You're talking about me

00:21.521 --> 00:23.024
personally? Mm-hmm, you.

00:29.014 --> 00:31.438
Well, I think you're right. Over the many years 
that I worked here, the thing that was most

00:32.212 --> 00:53.967
important was that I had a part in some of the 
organizations

00:32.212 --> 00:53.967
and changes in attitude about communications 
from the student to the top and then from the top

00:32.212 --> 00:53.967
down to the student.

00:55.465 --> 01:02.112
This is manifested by the fact that we had a 
counseling program for the first time. We had a

01:02.192 --> 01:03.614
testing program. We had a good organized loan 
program. And I didn't do this myself, but I was one

01:07.618 --> 01:20.933
of the people that worked on it all the time with 
many others, counselors, and chief of housing,

01:07.618 --> 01:20.933
and the dean, and some of the academic people. and 
Wayne Stark in the Memorial Student Center. We

01:24.338 --> 01:27.661
worked with him a lot on some of these things. And we 
got

01:27.681 --> 01:37.331
a lot of programs started that had never been 
instituted at A&M. And we think all of these

01:38.052 --> 01:45.600
things, through the long pull, kept student 
attitude good. And it's given them better

01:47.021 --> 01:50.785
education.

01:53.178 --> 02:02.067
Well, just like in our discipline attitude, we 
didn't just call them in and tell them they'd been

01:53.178 --> 02:02.067
bad boys and we were going to kick them out of 
school. But we didn't ever say we'd kick you out.

02:05.911 --> 02:11.056
We'd say you're suspended for a period of time, 
that you go out and reflect and think about this. We

02:12.217 --> 02:13.738
never closed the door on the guy. Now, when I came 
here, we found a lot of students that had been

02:15.100 --> 02:22.527
dismissed, and this meant they couldn't ever come 
back. One of the first things that I did was went to

02:23.553 --> 02:32.662
the president, Mr. Gilkes, and I said, Mr. Gilkes, 
now here's a guy, a good guy, I know him, but I've

02:23.553 --> 02:32.662
talked to him a number of times. He's been 
dismissed from A&M, and he's been told he can't

02:32.682 --> 02:38.407
ever come back, but he wants to finish his 
education. And I'd like to go before the executive

02:38.427 --> 02:46.335
committee and plea for these guys, because it 
isn't right to kick a kid out of school and say he

02:38.427 --> 02:46.335
can't ever go back again. Just for one mistake. So 
the executive committee, now this is, I got to take

02:51.683 --> 03:09.568
pride in that because we did this as a Dean of 
Students organization and I was the speaker for

02:51.683 --> 03:09.568
them and Mr. Gilkes joined with me and he plugged 
for this at the executive committee and they voted

02:51.683 --> 03:09.568
to let every one of you guys back in school. Every 
one of them was readmitted and so far as I know only

03:09.588 --> 03:20.003
one man since that time has been dismissed from 
A&M.

03:21.704 --> 03:27.631
We changed, we had, we kept meticulous and minute 
detailed records for a long time. And we finally

03:27.751 --> 03:30.474
found out that this is hurting students. And we had 
a confidential file that we needed to keep. But we,

03:37.482 --> 03:46.952
before I left that office over there, I got 
permission from the dean to destroy two or three,

03:37.482 --> 03:46.952
two and a half time truckloads of records. because 
they had a lot of little things about students when

03:48.063 --> 03:57.054
they were freshmen and sophomores that could be 
held against them for a lifetime. And they were not

03:57.074 --> 03:59.998
serious enough. They were bad, like lying and 
cheating and stealing and getting drunk and

04:00.018 --> 04:10.712
beating up some poor old guy downtown or something 
like that. We didn't think this was bad, but it's

04:10.812 --> 04:15.758
not enough to jeopardize a guy for a lifetime. So I 
think through the years that this is the thing that

04:17.223 --> 04:29.702
a lot of us, Mr. Gilchrist, I'd say was a 
predominant figure in this kind of an attitude,

04:17.223 --> 04:29.702
and Mr. Rudder, Dean Hannigan, Ken Berthe, Bob 
Kahn, Doe Rollins, Bob Murray, WG Brazil, Perry,

04:29.742 --> 04:44.665
Melcher,

04:47.446 --> 04:47.946
Oates.

04:51.110 --> 04:55.474
I could probably name some others, but these are 
guys that were dedicated to this. And we talked

04:55.634 --> 05:03.882
about it, and we talked to a lot of other people and 
got their support. But all of these things have

05:03.902 --> 05:13.892
helped, not completely, but helped develop a good 
publication board and a good to a publication

05:14.513 --> 05:19.042
program and all of these other things like 
placement and loan and so on. I don't know whether

05:21.548 --> 05:23.592
that answers your question or not. I think that 
does a pretty good job of it. Well, we certainly

05:27.019 --> 05:28.181
appreciate it. I think you've covered lots of 
ground. Well, I hope you find something in there

05:30.546 --> 05:34.294
that might be good for your records.
