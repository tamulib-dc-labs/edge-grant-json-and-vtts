WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:03.703
One, two, three.

00:05.745 --> 00:06.425
Okay, testing.

00:06.846 --> 00:07.526
One, two, three, four.

00:07.546 --> 00:08.947
No, you don't have to hold that up.

00:08.967 --> 00:09.928
Testing one, two, three, four.

00:11.209 --> 00:13.271
This is Thursday, August 16.

00:13.972 --> 00:27.544
This is the second tape with Greg Garcia, and we were getting ready to chat about some more about his freshman year, particularly intrigued about the fish drill team.

00:27.944 --> 00:32.248
How did you and others in your day, how did you

00:32.988 --> 00:37.715
apply for, how did you get in, how was the group selected?

00:38.376 --> 00:40.940
Tell me everything you can about the fish drill team.

00:41.801 --> 00:57.544
Actually there was an announcement made in a mess hall that anyone that had interest in being a member of the fish drill team to report it to the drill field at a certain day, you know at 5 o'clock, whatever time it was.

00:58.385 --> 01:06.978
What they did is we had probably over, I'm going to say about over 200 freshmen that were trying out for the fish drill team, maybe 250.

01:07.118 --> 01:08.320
I don't remember how many there were.

01:08.380 --> 01:14.109
But the idea here was that they looked at you as a person that could already drill.

01:14.249 --> 01:15.511
Now, they weren't going to train you.

01:15.551 --> 01:18.115
They already wanted someone that was capable of doing that.

01:19.037 --> 01:26.468
And most of the members that made the fish drill team all had probably previous OOTC experience in their high schools.

01:26.819 --> 01:33.571
And so they went through the process of selection and they took 40 cadets.

01:33.992 --> 01:36.136
Had you had that experience?

01:36.657 --> 01:39.321
Yes, I had high school at ROTC.

01:39.722 --> 01:40.684
At which high school?

01:40.704 --> 01:42.587
Central Catholic High School, yeah.

01:43.288 --> 01:45.312
I was on the drill team there at Central Catholic.

01:45.713 --> 01:51.443
As a matter of fact, there was like about four or five of us from Central Catholic that tried out for the drill team.

01:51.423 --> 01:53.285
And every one of us made it.

01:53.945 --> 01:59.831
And there was another school in San Antonio, Jefferson High School, that had quite a few kids that tried out.

01:59.951 --> 02:08.740
But there was a pretty good size or a big blend of kids from all over the state, Laredo, Dallas, Fort Worth.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.482
We even had one that I can recall from Louisiana.

02:12.403 --> 02:20.451
And so once they had the body of 40, they went ahead and

02:20.971 --> 02:24.857
And they would drill you for a period of time.

02:25.398 --> 02:31.647
And then it came time to select the drill team commander, which was from the freshman.

02:31.927 --> 02:40.119
And the pride of that was the fact that the freshman would be the only fish that would carry a saber because he was the commander.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.168
And also the guide on bear was another position that they

02:46.908 --> 02:52.375
they looked at real close to try to select one of the members, and so anybody could try out for it.

02:53.016 --> 03:07.735
So probably out of the group of 40, I'm going to say that about four tried out for drill team commanders, and about two or three for a guide on bearer.

03:08.305 --> 03:10.247
I tried out for both.

03:11.468 --> 03:18.516
And we got down to two people, and I was one of the two for the drill team commander.

03:19.617 --> 03:26.765
And I got beat out by a young man that had just gotten out of the Marine Corps.

03:26.785 --> 03:35.494
And he was like, how would you say, a 21-year-old freshman in the Corps.

03:35.896 --> 03:45.770
So they picked him, and so then since I had tried out for guide-on-bearer, and so I was a guide-on-bearer for the fish drill team.

03:46.732 --> 03:51.438
And so we would drill every day, every day.

03:51.598 --> 03:52.139
About how long?

03:52.159 --> 03:54.983
5 to about 6.30.

03:55.464 --> 03:55.744
Where?

03:56.826 --> 04:00.351
Different parts of the campus, depending on where they needed us to

04:00.618 --> 04:03.181
Whatever we were going to do, we were going to compete in the competition.

04:03.241 --> 04:05.905
If it was on a grass area, then we would drill on a grass area.

04:05.925 --> 04:12.854
If it was a hard top or a flat top area, we would drill on a parking lot, depending on what we were going to compete for.

04:13.495 --> 04:14.316
We were going to be in a parade.

04:14.356 --> 04:15.878
Of course, it was on a flat top.

04:15.918 --> 04:22.086
But we would drill every day for an hour, hour and a half.

04:22.606 --> 04:28.239
And then we would go to the mess hall and eat with the athletes.

04:28.459 --> 04:29.662
We would eat with all the athletes.

04:30.203 --> 04:39.163
So we would go to the Dunkin' Mess Hall, and it wasn't the football players, because they ate over in another place, but like the ones that did the other kind of sports, the other sports anyway.

04:40.072 --> 04:44.577
That was the advantage of being on the fish drill team because you didn't have to go with your outfit, see.

04:44.597 --> 04:50.383
And so actually you didn't have to follow the hard regulation of sitting at attention.

04:50.583 --> 04:59.773
So I mean you still had to wear your bib and you had to halfway sit at attention and you could carry a little bit of conversation amongst you.

05:00.374 --> 05:03.598
But that was one of the advantages.

05:03.618 --> 05:04.999
And the other was that

05:05.418 --> 05:14.628
An outfit would hold you in high regard if you were a member of the Fish Drill Team because they accumulated points for the fact that you were on the Fish Drill Team.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.351
So that was points toward the General Moore trophy.

05:18.092 --> 05:23.738
So automatically they would look at you as a leader for the rest of the freshmen in your outfit.

05:23.758 --> 05:29.524
So they would always come to the Fish Drill Team members.

05:29.585 --> 05:31.847
I was the only one in my outfit that was on the Fish Drill Team.

05:32.418 --> 05:37.323
And they would always tell you, okay, I want you to do this with the other freshmen.

05:37.343 --> 05:40.987
I want you to show them how to polish their shoes, how to wear their brass.

05:41.067 --> 05:45.132
And so they would always kind of start to bring out leaders within the fish class.

05:45.572 --> 05:52.640
And so that was, it was an exciting year because we did go, made a couple of trips.

05:52.740 --> 05:56.164
We didn't travel like they do today, but we traveled too.

05:56.144 --> 06:00.608
We went to Galveston for Splash Day back in those, I don't even think they, I think they have Mardi Gras Day now.

06:01.529 --> 06:06.754
And Laredo, they always had a Washington birthday and they used to have a big competition down there.

06:06.774 --> 06:12.219
We went to that, went to San Antonio for the Battle of Flowers parade and the night parade.

06:13.280 --> 06:23.350
And so it gave us an opportunity to go to certain places and of course they had to let us go because of the fact that we were members of the fish drill team.

06:23.667 --> 06:30.536
One of the requirements was that in order to stay on the drill team, you had to maintain a certain GPA.

06:31.016 --> 06:40.308
And if you did not maintain that GPA, then you would automatically be, you had to stay out till you brought that GPA back up to the standard that they required.

06:41.330 --> 06:43.212
And the official team commander

06:43.732 --> 06:45.294
I still remember his name, Ben Rice.

06:46.155 --> 06:51.161
He got in scholastic problems after his first semester.

06:51.181 --> 07:04.135
So then I was a fish drill team commander for the second semester up till the time that he brought his grades up, which was close to Galveston, Galveston Splash Day.

07:04.836 --> 07:09.942
So in here, the activities that occurred here on the campus, I was kind of

07:10.411 --> 07:14.077
I guess what would you say, the interim fish drill team commander.

07:15.098 --> 07:20.227
And they used to have, and they don't have that anymore, we had what we used to call a combat ball.

07:21.689 --> 07:33.027
And that was a big event for the fish drill team because they were like the honor guard to all the dignitaries that came in and when the dignitaries came in we would

07:33.327 --> 07:56.601
form a line and and and take them form two lines and then take them and automatically we would take them into the uh into a cell and somebody had to come over there and get them out you know some other dignitary that i think they had to make some kind of contribution so that was interesting and uh but they had we had a lot of pride the kids had a lot of the students had a lot of pride the cadets were very proud

07:57.020 --> 08:02.686
They were always looked at by other freshmen in the Corps as, you know, the best.

08:03.287 --> 08:06.730
And I understand they're bringing it back this year.

08:06.931 --> 08:11.576
We understand that the fish drill team is coming back this year.

08:12.517 --> 08:22.167
I've heard that some cadets that wanted to come here because we did not have a fish drill team decided not to come here and not be members of the Corps.

08:22.568 --> 08:29.662
A lot of cadets will always look at A&M and look at the fish drill team and say, you know, I want to be part of that group.

08:29.682 --> 08:35.554
And when the tragedies that happened with it, it's kind of like sad.

08:35.614 --> 08:41.986
But anyway, I think that eventually, I think we're going to work it out.

08:42.006 --> 08:43.429
I think we'll have it back again.

08:44.033 --> 08:52.688
We would follow, as a freshman all the way to senior, you would follow the freshmen that would come in and you would always go out there and work with them.

08:52.808 --> 09:02.464
But it was more on a volunteer basis, not the way they actually went to toward the end where they had these guys they called the hounds, and those hounds actually

09:02.714 --> 09:05.256
were a little too hard on these cadets.

09:05.297 --> 09:14.405
You know actually you needed to work with them in a manner of actually drilling and discipline, but not hazing.

09:14.706 --> 09:16.027
And they would not let us haze.

09:16.668 --> 09:19.811
The upperclassmen would not let, we could not be hazed.

09:19.851 --> 09:29.960
In other words, we had to run labs with the rifles and all that kind of stuff, but it wasn't a thing where you would have to do certain things that were an upperclassmen.

09:30.021 --> 09:32.603
Because the upperclassmen that were like our moderators,

09:32.583 --> 09:33.845
We didn't have that many.

09:33.865 --> 09:48.330
We may have like three or four moderators, and those moderators would work with that group up to a point where you felt that they were ready, and then you would only keep one of those moderators to be with them for the rest of the year.

09:49.036 --> 09:53.423
We had a, I'd say, he wasn't the one, yeah, Captain Reeves.

09:53.964 --> 09:55.487
I'm trying to remember his Air Force.

09:55.927 --> 09:56.729
R-I-V-E-S?

09:57.229 --> 09:58.732
R-E-E-S-E.

10:00.194 --> 10:05.463
I think Captain Reeves was the moderator for the fish drill team.

10:06.505 --> 10:11.253
And he was, as a matter of fact, I saw him in one of the last competitions before they dissolved the drill team.

10:11.914 --> 10:15.820
And they invited him to a kind of reunion type deal and he was there.

10:16.542 --> 10:17.865
And he was already retired.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.227
You know, he's up in his ears already.

10:19.247 --> 10:24.337
But anyway, he would go everywhere with the fish drill team.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.582
And then the moderator would go with the fish drill team.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.670
By the time I was a senior, they were already making the trip to the Mardi Gras.

10:31.072 --> 10:34.676
And so that was a big opportunity for them to go to Mardi Gras.

10:34.696 --> 10:47.629
And they were starting to go to some bigger competitions because they were better known and you know so they were, I guess the school had more money to give them to make these bigger trips like they went to Florida or to the Mardi Gras New Orleans.

10:47.649 --> 10:50.652
So it was a great experience.

10:51.132 --> 10:52.514
It taught me a lot of discipline.

10:53.415 --> 10:59.661
So I got the impression during your freshman year by being on the fish drill team

11:00.012 --> 11:08.589
you had less harassment or teasing or hazing than other freshmen might have had.

11:08.629 --> 11:09.631
Not necessarily so.

11:09.651 --> 11:11.214
It depended on.

11:11.334 --> 11:18.809
If there were certain upperclassmen that didn't like the fact or maybe had a little bit of a, or a little envious, then they would ride you hard.

11:19.430 --> 11:22.476
But the other upperclassmen would not let them

11:22.827 --> 11:31.525
get out of hand with you because they would always tell me, you got to be proud that this freshman is part of the fish drill team because he's he's representing our outfits.

11:32.888 --> 11:35.153
And you live still with your outfit?

11:35.173 --> 11:35.634
Oh, yes.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.157
We lived in our outfits.

11:37.424 --> 11:47.618
We kept our rifles in our holes, and we made sure they were clean, and we took them out to the drill field all the time, and they inspected them just like anybody else.

11:48.098 --> 12:04.360
Funny thing about it is you had Air Force and Army in there at that time, so some of the cadets that were on the drill team may have never had experience with a rifle, so they had to teach that part of the drill, manual of arms and whatever it took.

12:04.711 --> 12:17.117
It was amazing what you could do when you train a group of cadets that probably didn't know each other from whatever, and come together.

12:17.620 --> 12:23.632
and really bond together and really have an experience of their life in freshman year.

12:23.772 --> 12:28.902
And the fact that you were Hispanic had nothing to do with your being selected or not being selected?

12:29.143 --> 12:30.285
No, I don't think so.

12:30.325 --> 12:34.954
I think that it was mostly on ability.

12:34.934 --> 12:40.322
As far as you know who made the selections of the two?

12:41.324 --> 12:56.867
Actually the moderators that they had from the previous year from the fish drill team plus the certain officers, say military officers assigned to the Trigon, maybe two or three, and some of the sergeants that they would bring out there.

12:56.887 --> 13:00.553
And so they'd take the masts and then they'd start cutting it down little by little by little.

13:00.533 --> 13:02.757
And until they got to that 40.

13:02.977 --> 13:04.800
And then that's where they sat.

13:05.401 --> 13:06.263
And that's the way they kept it.

13:06.724 --> 13:15.538
Describe in your freshman, sophomore year or so, describe a typical class day, a Monday through Friday.

13:15.899 --> 13:17.001
What time did you get up?

13:17.081 --> 13:18.143
What did you do when?

13:18.183 --> 13:19.585
Okay.

13:20.186 --> 13:26.457
Typical class day was like, we would get up around 6 o'clock in the morning.

13:27.061 --> 13:42.524
maybe a little earlier, 5.30, depending on whether your uniform was ready or not, because you had to make sure when you fell out in the morning, the uniform, mainly when you were a freshman or sophomore, there really was not much difference between a freshman and a sophomore outside of the uniform distinction, but you still had to follow the same rules.

13:42.604 --> 13:47.010
And you would fall, we probably would fall out during the start of the year,

13:47.243 --> 13:57.607
Before, you know, we've had the first football games and all that, we would fall out a little earlier because we had to drill, drill, drill, drill, trying to get the outfit ready for the first march into the stadium.

13:58.328 --> 14:06.467
And so you would drill like, you may fall out like 6.30, drill for half an hour, go to the mess hall about 7.00.

14:07.173 --> 14:13.579
finish your breakfast and then come back and go to your class, depending on what time your class was.

14:13.980 --> 14:15.261
But every day was the same.

14:15.281 --> 14:16.623
I mean, every day was the same.

14:17.363 --> 14:31.898
And I don't know, maybe somebody else explained to you that we had whistle jocks that would make sure that we were all up, give us the meal for the day, for that morning, and then the uniform for that day, and that's the way you had to come out.

14:32.350 --> 14:35.576
And they would inspect you every morning.

14:35.856 --> 14:36.978
They would inspect you every morning.

14:37.219 --> 14:42.889
Did your uniform as a freshman have any symbol on it that you were on the fish drill team?

14:43.330 --> 14:43.510
No.

14:43.871 --> 14:45.994
You had to earn, you had to complete.

14:46.014 --> 14:53.708
And then at the completion of your freshman year, they would give you a medal and what we used to call the barber pole.

14:54.329 --> 14:56.974
It was a maroon and white

14:57.393 --> 14:59.998
It was a little, what do you call it, a ribbon.

15:00.438 --> 15:06.869
And it was maroon and white and it was diagonal so we called it the barber pole.

15:06.889 --> 15:10.776
So if you had a barber pole, you were pretty good.

15:11.117 --> 15:18.169
So anyway, that's the only time that we were able to identify.

15:19.297 --> 15:23.265
say like the freshman in the Corps knew who was on the fish drill team.

15:24.387 --> 15:34.587
I mean they knew exactly who was on the fish drill team because they used to watch us drill and they used to, and the upperclassmen also kind of, they knew someone, I mean they knew who was on the fish drill team.

15:35.169 --> 15:37.373
Now your freshman major was what?

15:38.298 --> 15:39.940
What were you majoring in as a freshman?

15:40.161 --> 15:41.663
I actually started on pre-law.

15:41.823 --> 15:42.163
Pre-law.

15:42.524 --> 15:42.724
All right.

15:42.744 --> 15:49.233
So most of your classes, back to the class day, most of your classes were in the middle of the campus, the central part?

15:49.253 --> 15:49.474
Yes.

15:49.734 --> 15:49.954
Yes.

15:50.275 --> 15:50.355
Yes.

15:50.375 --> 15:54.441
Mostly in the academic building and right around the academic building.

15:54.861 --> 15:56.003
Then I

15:56.540 --> 16:05.894
I went to business and then so it was a way, well still the English courses and Spanish courses were in the academic building.

16:06.014 --> 16:10.641
When you went to class that freshman year, what did you, what stuff did you carry with you?

16:11.383 --> 16:16.270
Well just your books that you were, for the classes that you had to attend.

16:16.705 --> 16:26.434
It was a rule and regulation that a freshman going to the class could not be stopped or hazed by an upperclassman.

16:26.675 --> 16:30.968
I mean, you would still have to whip out to the upperclassman, but if they detained you

16:31.606 --> 16:36.632
from getting to your class on time, then they would be in trouble, see.

16:36.652 --> 16:38.034
And they observed that rule.

16:38.054 --> 16:47.026
I mean it's like if another upperclassman saw some other upperclassman, you know, kind of giving you a hard time and making you walk out of your way, and he would ask, well where's your class?

16:47.606 --> 16:50.190
Tell them, well the academic, you better, you let him go.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.112
So they would, you know, they would automatically

16:52.447 --> 16:55.652
relieve you and let you go on to your class.

16:56.253 --> 17:01.841
So the only, we didn't have like backpacks or nobody rode a bicycle.

17:01.901 --> 17:03.183
Everybody walked everywhere.

17:03.243 --> 17:04.625
You know, there was no such thing as that.

17:04.645 --> 17:08.791
It was not even a privilege to have those kind of things.

17:08.831 --> 17:14.119
You couldn't, it actually wasn't a privilege for bicycles for freshmen.

17:14.139 --> 17:17.644
So freshmen had to always walk in a certain area,

17:17.624 --> 17:24.215
And I understand that before I came here that they have to walk on the gutters on the side of the curb.

17:24.696 --> 17:26.519
But that wasn't a requirement when we were here.

17:26.559 --> 17:29.624
We would just have to make sure that we were always walking like on the right side.

17:30.405 --> 17:33.570
And when we'd go up to somebody, of course, we'd whip out.

17:33.771 --> 17:44.188
And during the mornings, if you had a blank hour unscheduled, where did you spend that?

17:44.455 --> 17:45.737
It depended.

17:46.558 --> 17:54.891
If you were, say, in good academic standings, then you could use that hour any way you wanted to.

17:54.911 --> 17:57.755
You didn't have to report back to your home.

17:59.097 --> 18:05.207
If you were not in good academic standings, in the first hour, I don't think they made you come back.

18:05.647 --> 18:09.594
But if you had two hours open, you had to come back to your dorm and study.

18:10.735 --> 18:11.897
And they checked on you.

18:12.451 --> 18:14.373
What about going to the MSC or to the library?

18:14.394 --> 18:15.275
Well, we would go there.

18:15.535 --> 18:21.583
I mean, if we had an hour to kill, we would go to the student center and go to the coffee shop there.

18:21.603 --> 18:22.544
That was a hangout then.

18:22.744 --> 18:24.967
Everybody went to the coffee shop.

18:24.987 --> 18:30.174
And as you became, you know, upperclassmen, you were junior, senior, that was really the big hangout for the upperclassmen.

18:30.655 --> 18:35.621
There really were not a lot of places that you could go to here in College Station at that time.

18:35.641 --> 18:41.108
College Station was very small and Brian was kind of distant for us to go to.

18:41.442 --> 18:45.447
If we went to Bryan, we would go to Bryan to go to a movie.

18:46.348 --> 18:50.033
Or we went out to eat, we'd have maybe between Bryan and College Station.

18:50.734 --> 18:56.000
But a lot of times, there was no transportation, because you didn't have cars.

18:57.442 --> 18:58.884
Not very many freshmen had cars.

18:59.505 --> 19:05.653
And we would mostly go to the student center, as you mentioned.

19:05.673 --> 19:09.137
And then in the evenings, like on weekends, to Guyon Hall.

19:09.691 --> 19:12.755
And you would, for lunch, you'd go back?

19:13.456 --> 19:14.678
You'd have to come back to the dorm.

19:15.459 --> 19:17.462
When your classes were over, everybody came back.

19:17.883 --> 19:18.383
And fall in.

19:18.464 --> 19:23.110
And you would fall in and you'd march to the mess hall and they'd break in the mess hall.

19:23.531 --> 19:28.318
Of course, we had Subisa mess hall and we had Duncan mess hall.

19:28.999 --> 19:33.365
The first brigade was at Subisa mess hall.

19:34.006 --> 19:38.432
The second brigade in the Air Force was at Duncan mess hall.

19:38.412 --> 19:39.393
to include the band.

19:39.434 --> 19:40.515
The band was also in there.

19:40.856 --> 19:41.897
So you were in Duncan?

19:41.917 --> 19:42.979
I was in Duncan, yeah.

19:42.999 --> 19:43.900
I was in the Air Force.

19:43.920 --> 19:50.730
Then in the afternoons, what did you do two, three o'clock or so?

19:51.471 --> 19:53.875
Well if I didn't have class I had to come back to the dorm.

19:55.137 --> 20:03.129
And unless they gave me the time to do something else, remember I told them that I had to go get a haircut or I had to go to the laundry, I had to do this, I had to do that.

20:03.749 --> 20:04.791
Okay, that was fine.

20:05.075 --> 20:12.448
But like I said, if your grades weren't up to par, then you really didn't have an option but to come back and study.

20:12.788 --> 20:18.398
And there was a requirement that they wanted to make sure that you made the grades.

20:18.698 --> 20:24.248
And I know that we probably lost 40, 45% of our freshman class, you know.

20:24.481 --> 20:31.532
We had a lot of students and most of them were, I mean I'd say about half the student body here was in the Corps.

20:31.652 --> 20:43.751
So I think if I recall right there was probably, well there was two brigades, 35 companies I think, and 17, maybe 20 Air Force squadrons, somewhere in there.

20:45.133 --> 20:48.919
Because of fish drill team, your intramural activity then

20:49.338 --> 20:59.011
Yeah, we really didn't participate in intramurals unless you didn't have drill or something came up and you were around the dorm.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.795
I remember this happening to me one time.

21:02.796 --> 21:07.583
The athletic officer came up and I was in the room and we didn't have drill that day.

21:07.681 --> 21:11.126
And so he asked me, Fish Garcia, can you swim?

21:11.166 --> 21:11.767
I said, yes, sir.

21:12.669 --> 21:13.650
Put on your bathing suit.

21:13.851 --> 21:17.436
So we went over to the old natatorium that they had.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.000
And we were having a competition there.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.883
We had to swim and meet.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.826
And so I had to swim.

21:23.846 --> 21:25.909
I thought I was going to die.

21:28.433 --> 21:30.957
But I mean, I had to do it, you know.

21:31.037 --> 21:32.760
But not too much intramurals at all.

21:33.230 --> 21:41.637
Now in the evening, then go back after drill team practice, fall in to march to chow,

21:41.802 --> 21:43.285
Well, the drill team went separate.

21:43.305 --> 21:44.066
Oh, you went as a unit.

21:44.086 --> 21:45.869
You went as a unit, but we would go later.

21:46.010 --> 21:46.711
Yes.

21:46.791 --> 21:49.215
Then back to your room for?

21:49.576 --> 21:49.957
Yeah.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.239
Well, I had to be in the room by 7.30.

21:51.279 --> 21:53.102
There was no in this and buts.

21:53.123 --> 21:55.627
I had to be in the room at 7.30 for call to quarters.

21:56.388 --> 22:05.565
And what were the kinds of excuses or what did y'all sometimes do to evade having to be in the room

22:05.545 --> 22:06.889
There weren't too many.

22:07.972 --> 22:19.183
If you belonged to a certain society, like say you were in the Business Society or the Insurance Society or the Marketing Society or the San Antonio A&M Club, which is the one that I belonged to.

22:19.585 --> 22:25.673
then you would have to get a pass signed by the sergeant of the day, okay?

22:25.954 --> 22:29.739
And so you would sign the pass, or the sophomore of the day would sign the pass.

22:29.759 --> 22:35.447
They always had a sophomore, junior, and officer of the day, and they would have to sign off on it.

22:35.487 --> 22:39.633
Somebody had to sign off on it, and you had to put down when you were leaving and when you were coming back.

22:40.874 --> 22:43.618
How easy was it to make up an excuse

22:44.375 --> 22:46.658
and get by with something?

22:47.480 --> 22:48.421
It wasn't too easy.

22:48.441 --> 22:48.762
Wasn't too easy?

22:48.782 --> 22:50.845
It wasn't too easy because they could find out.

22:51.426 --> 23:02.823
We used to have to go to every football game and we had to stay in, I mean that's just to give you an example, that's the way it carried over into trying to get out during the week to go to a meeting or something like that.

23:03.384 --> 23:13.639
So what would happen is that if you went off campus to a football game, you better have been at the football game because you'd come back that Monday and they'd ask you questions about the game.

23:14.429 --> 23:20.296
And they'd ask you about certain things that would kind of confuse you.

23:20.416 --> 23:27.604
And if either you had to read the paper very well or you had better been at the game, you know.

23:27.884 --> 23:34.912
What if someone then was caught, that they had made up some baloney, what?

23:35.773 --> 23:37.856
They would wind up in the bullring.

23:37.956 --> 23:39.017
They used to have the bullring.

23:39.798 --> 23:41.820
And the bullring, you know, you'd have to spend

23:42.273 --> 23:46.418
whatever hours they gave you on the bullring, it could be four hours, five hours, ten hours, whatever.

23:47.119 --> 24:00.535
And so every Saturday afternoon they'd have bullring drills, so you'd have to go behind the Trigon, they'd give you a rifle, and you'd march up and down for two hours, three hours, whatever they told you to march, and then they'd turn it in, they'd check off and see how many hours you had.

24:01.035 --> 24:03.478
You still had some remaining, then you came back the following Saturday.

24:04.079 --> 24:10.727
Fortunately, I never did really have a lot of bullring hours to hold me up, but

24:11.230 --> 24:12.672
All right, you went to class regularly?

24:13.674 --> 24:14.635
I would always go to class.

24:15.336 --> 24:19.402
And how did, how did Aggie fish behave in class then?

24:21.505 --> 24:22.286
Were they attentive?

24:22.627 --> 24:23.328
Were they alert?

24:23.608 --> 24:24.390
Yes, yes.

24:24.570 --> 24:26.733
I mean, I don't, I can't remember that they weren't.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.677
Didn't, few if any went to sleep?

24:29.918 --> 24:35.466
No, that I can recall, no, I mean maybe some, yeah, but not like

24:36.577 --> 24:45.699
like I hear that it happens today that they say excuse-wise that they had too many, too late, the Lowers were very late because of this and that.

24:45.980 --> 24:54.400
And I mean I'm not saying that we didn't have those kind of situations but I don't know, the professors were pretty stern about you going to sleep in class.

24:54.852 --> 24:58.156
And the rules and regulations were pretty hard.

24:58.196 --> 25:04.723
And since it was all male professors, I mean, they could pretty well hold up to whatever they wanted you to do, see, so.

25:04.823 --> 25:10.289
Do you remember any jokes or pranks that ever occurred in class that any students pulled off?

25:11.491 --> 25:14.113
No, not that I can recall, no.

25:14.874 --> 25:21.822
During that first year, were there some special teachers that you remember, some good ones?

25:22.882 --> 25:24.264
Some people that are memorable?

25:25.285 --> 25:26.426
I couldn't remember their names.

25:26.946 --> 25:28.368
You know, I think there were some.

25:28.588 --> 25:32.933
I think like, I remember my algebra teacher.

25:32.953 --> 25:33.354
Who was that?

25:33.874 --> 25:38.920
I can't remember his name, but he was, he came, he was in the, he had just gotten his masters.

25:39.400 --> 25:43.224
And he was, he had been in the Corps.

25:44.205 --> 25:45.227
And he was very good.

25:45.507 --> 25:47.069
He was very good, but I can't remember his name.

25:47.429 --> 25:50.172
Who did you turn to for advice?

25:51.603 --> 25:53.405
I got a problem, how do I deal with this?

25:53.425 --> 25:54.226
We had counselors.

25:54.527 --> 25:54.827
Okay.

25:54.847 --> 25:59.313
Yeah, we had counselors and we'd go visit with them if you needed to.

25:59.654 --> 26:07.504
And the only time I really remember really going to them is whenever I had changed my major.

26:07.864 --> 26:14.573
And then also I think I went to the profs more than I did any professors more than I did anybody else.

26:14.653 --> 26:16.716
I mean if I had a problem I'd go to a professor.

26:16.898 --> 26:28.369
And I found that out was probably the best thing to do as you went into your... By the time I was a junior, I pretty well figured out that, you know, the guy I need to go to is the guy who's teaching me the course.

26:28.789 --> 26:33.494
And I explained the situation to him, and most of them would work with you, even though they'd say they're real hard-nosed.

26:33.954 --> 26:35.676
I do remember one professor in accounting.

26:37.578 --> 26:38.138
Flat top.

26:39.119 --> 26:40.100
He was gray-haired.

26:40.441 --> 26:42.502
Everybody thought he was tough, tough.

26:42.523 --> 26:44.104
And I had him for cost accounting.

26:44.607 --> 26:46.531
And Judge Stewart?

26:46.871 --> 26:53.444
No, like Pierce or he was Pickard or Pierce Pickle, something like that.

26:53.484 --> 26:54.366
I can't remember his name.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.792
But he really was a fair guy.

26:58.634 --> 26:59.335
He really was.

26:59.355 --> 27:00.878
I remember going to him and telling him,

27:01.381 --> 27:05.447
I have a cost accounting exam, and I have an exam.

27:07.010 --> 27:11.697
Talking about class and so forth.

27:13.059 --> 27:15.823
You don't remember any pranks in class?

27:16.645 --> 27:17.085
At all.

27:17.165 --> 27:18.147
Not that I can remember.

27:18.367 --> 27:18.588
Right.

27:18.808 --> 27:22.333
What about in the dormitories in the night?

27:23.034 --> 27:25.478
There was always stuff going on.

27:25.618 --> 27:26.600
Describe some of those.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.603
I may have mentioned this to you before, but I'm

27:28.904 --> 27:37.375
The outfit I was in when I was a freshman was Squadron Six, and our mascot was a pink elephant in a champagne glass.

27:38.096 --> 27:41.220
The elephant kind of in a integrated.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.922
What was the nickname of?

27:43.403 --> 27:43.743
Elno.

27:44.364 --> 27:44.705
Elno?

27:44.845 --> 27:45.626
Elno Six, yeah.

27:46.627 --> 27:47.528
E-L-N-O.

27:47.748 --> 27:48.349
Elno Six.

27:49.270 --> 27:50.852
We couldn't say hell no, we said Elno.

27:51.974 --> 27:52.555
Elno Six.

27:53.776 --> 27:58.202
And it was a freshman's privilege to

27:58.958 --> 28:08.458
We had these stencils, pink elephant footprints, and we would stencil parts of the campus with pink elephant footprints.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.462
So you would do it in the late night.

28:11.704 --> 28:12.546
Was it paint?

28:13.049 --> 28:15.011
Yes, we get in trouble, too.

28:15.832 --> 28:16.293
They caught us.

28:16.313 --> 28:17.054
They had to catch us.

28:17.614 --> 28:20.978
And so it got a little bad.

28:20.998 --> 28:27.125
So Captain Shepard, who was our attack officer, Korean War veteran.

28:27.666 --> 28:29.708
I mean, sharp, sharp, sharp man.

28:29.868 --> 28:33.692
I mean, that guy's uniform, every day he came out to the quad.

28:34.373 --> 28:38.438
And it looked like he just stepped into that uniform.

28:38.758 --> 28:39.819
He was really something.

28:40.060 --> 28:41.301
And he was a paratrooper.

28:42.344 --> 28:51.356
He was disabled in the sense that he, I guess he must have gotten, he was wounded in the Korean War, so he kind of walked with a little limp.

28:51.917 --> 28:56.723
But anyway, he came and talked to us and told us that this was getting out of hand, that we had to stop.

28:57.864 --> 29:03.131
He says, I know you freshmen will not admit that you're doing this, but this has got to stop.

29:03.492 --> 29:11.963
And I have been instructed to let you all know that you will not do any more stenciling on anything.

29:12.398 --> 29:21.898
And I think what brought that on is that we stole one of the bass drums from the Aggie band, and we stenciled it with a Pink Elton footprint.

29:21.918 --> 29:24.383
And that kind of got things going in the wrong direction.

29:24.852 --> 29:27.377
And so he came over there and, well, that's part of the deal.

29:27.497 --> 29:30.823
And so anyway, so we just, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir.

29:30.843 --> 29:38.798
He says, and if I even see one more pink elephant footprint on this campus, I will, and it wasn't a big, it was, you know, small.

29:39.459 --> 29:47.755
He says, I will campus you, all the freshmen in the South, and you will not be able to go home, and I will make sure that you're waxing floors every weekend.

29:48.258 --> 29:48.719
Yes, sir.

29:49.542 --> 29:52.611
So he leaves, and that night, yeah, and the upperclassmen didn't say anything.

29:52.651 --> 29:54.697
They just listened, and they said, well, you heard the story.

29:55.579 --> 29:59.250
And so we went ahead and went back.

29:59.290 --> 30:02.098
We said, well, heck, we're going to do it one more time.

30:02.602 --> 30:07.753
So we went over to where the attack officer, his office was, and we put a pink elephant footprint on his door.

30:08.775 --> 30:10.198
So he came back the next morning.

30:10.419 --> 30:11.220
He was waiting for us.

30:12.283 --> 30:14.868
And he campused us, all the freshman class.

30:15.690 --> 30:20.340
And we spent about two weekends, three weekends, I think it was, we waxed floors.

30:20.658 --> 30:26.006
And this was after football season, so we didn't have anything to do anyway, so we waxed floors on weekends.

30:26.486 --> 30:28.709
We had the best floor in the whole campus.

30:29.611 --> 30:33.817
And so he finally just went ahead and told us, OK, that's enough.

30:35.499 --> 30:37.682
Where was the paint hidden?

30:37.862 --> 30:38.884
Where was the paint kept?

30:39.705 --> 30:42.649
The paint, we kept it in one of the rooms.

30:42.983 --> 30:45.646
It was, you know, we knew where it was at.

30:45.666 --> 30:47.088
We'd keep it in one of the freshmen's rooms.

30:47.528 --> 30:49.791
How many people were involved in that stencil?

30:49.811 --> 31:00.282
Normally, the stenciling, you'd get anywhere from six, four to six, depending on how many places you were going, because then they could split up into groups, but normally.

31:00.582 --> 31:03.706
How many people did a stencil once or more times?

31:04.407 --> 31:04.967
Twenty people?

31:05.027 --> 31:05.708
Fifty people?

31:05.848 --> 31:06.949
Oh, no, no, no, no.

31:06.969 --> 31:09.312
I would say, I would say that

31:09.646 --> 31:13.184
More than once, I couldn't tell you, because some of them would go out on their own at night.

31:13.224 --> 31:14.712
I guess they didn't have anything to do.
