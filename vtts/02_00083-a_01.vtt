00:05.161 --> 00:11.695
This is number one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, four.

00:11.796 --> 00:12.640
Now turn off.

00:31.537 --> 00:57.797
this is number four five six four five six seven four five six seven now turn off this is may the fifth and i'm at 307 dexter getting ready to chat with mr ed garner about his memories of being a student here mr garner say a sentence or two so we can check your microphone

00:58.199 --> 01:08.792
All right, what is the main thing we want to talk about is, I guess, from the time I got here till now.

01:08.892 --> 01:09.893
Just your student years.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.975
All right, now let me stop and see.

01:15.920 --> 01:26.653
To begin, Mr. Garner, let's assume that someone is listening to this 50 years from now, and they might not know about your background before you got to A&M.

01:27.258 --> 01:38.472
Begin, please, by describing where you were born, where you went to school, what your family did for a living, and your background before you came to A&M.

01:38.492 --> 01:56.995
I was born in March 16, 1914, in a little community out of Corsica County, Texas, about eight miles out in the country there.

01:57.734 --> 01:58.615
We were poor.

01:59.076 --> 02:00.018
God, we were poor.

02:00.939 --> 02:11.215
And my dad had a little hundred acres, and he'd make two or three bales of cotton a year.

02:12.276 --> 02:26.458
Anyway, in 1919, he moved us to Vernon, which is about 50 miles on the other side of Wichita Falls, going toward Amarillo.

02:28.497 --> 02:31.421
My mother or father had no education.

02:32.322 --> 02:36.227
I think both of them might have gotten to the fifth grade.

02:37.489 --> 02:48.523
And other than that, it's just—and I had five children in the family, three boys and two girls.

02:49.544 --> 02:55.312
And the boys—the two older boys never finished school.

02:56.273 --> 02:57.795
And I had two sisters.

02:57.995 --> 03:02.000
that both graduated from high school and that's as far as they ever got.

03:03.001 --> 03:15.297
And so, as I was growing up there in Vernon, oh we, when it came to cotton chopping time, we had to chop cotton.

03:15.978 --> 03:21.565
And when it came to cotton picking time, we had to pick cotton.

03:21.585 --> 03:22.427
And it was tough.

03:23.608 --> 03:25.150
God, we'd get out there

03:25.535 --> 03:35.050
They'd pick us up at 7 o'clock in the morning and bring us back in dark and make a dollar a day when they was chopping that cotton.

03:36.492 --> 03:41.701
And when they get to the picking time, why, it was forty cents a hundred.

03:41.761 --> 03:47.610
I could see it just as well as I could see outside.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.423
We were just poor people.

03:52.985 --> 03:58.912
There was nothing, nothing any poorer than, I guess, poor, being poor.

04:00.855 --> 04:17.817
But they, as the older, I was the youngest of the five, and they all seemed to finally leave home.

04:19.619 --> 04:24.525
And my mother died in 31.

04:25.786 --> 04:27.488
She was 44 years old.

04:27.508 --> 04:35.537
And that left me and I had a sister, which is six years older than I am, there with me.

04:35.577 --> 04:40.082
And that's what we had just she and I. Well, my dad had gone.

04:40.122 --> 04:42.885
He—she passed away.

04:43.486 --> 04:46.369
He went back to this love community out of Corsicana.

04:48.357 --> 04:49.839
We never saw him anymore.

04:51.201 --> 05:06.179
And so she was, when she graduated from high school, she went to work for Woolworths and made $9 a week, you know, 48 hours a week.

05:07.421 --> 05:12.407
And people don't realize anything like that now, but that's the way it was.

05:13.388 --> 05:18.094
And I was, when my mother passed away and

05:18.614 --> 05:26.143
Thirty-one, I was a junior in high school.

05:27.644 --> 05:35.093
So, I was playing football and basketball and track, and I wasn't very big.

05:36.254 --> 05:43.963
As old head Davis says, every time he sees me, he says, there goes the diminutive quarterback Vernon High.

05:44.956 --> 05:47.162
But anyway, we made it.

05:48.646 --> 05:59.235
And when I got out of school, I had gone to Austin on a scholarship.

06:00.262 --> 06:09.533
And I won the, in Wichita Falls, I had won the 100 and the 220 and the 220 low hurdles.

06:09.553 --> 06:12.277
So that got me.

06:12.297 --> 06:16.722
And then I got a scholarship from ACC, Abilene Christian College.

06:18.104 --> 06:28.056
And about a week before I went down there to enroll, I had a penicillitis operation.

06:28.076 --> 06:29.998
So they canceled that on me.

06:31.177 --> 06:46.799
So I, when I got to work again, I had a good friend, and they gave me a job delivering clothes in a little tailor shop.

06:47.480 --> 06:53.769
And I had been working on Saturdays for many years in the grocery store, so I kept that job.

06:54.851 --> 07:00.559
And I just worked where I could, and I saved my money.

07:01.568 --> 07:13.204
And after high school was over with, I had a football coach that graduated from A&M.

07:15.126 --> 07:22.176
And he suggested, since I wasn't too big, to go to some junior college.

07:23.506 --> 07:29.835
I wanted to come to A&M because I had written down here, and they said they'd give you your clothes.

07:29.915 --> 07:34.621
But then, hell, you know, it was just those old Army clothes, you know.

07:34.641 --> 07:35.622
I didn't know any better.

07:37.565 --> 07:45.335
So he gave me a recommendation to the policeman man down here.

07:45.816 --> 07:53.226
And then we had a senator from Chillicothe, which is a little town about 20 miles in front of us.

07:55.636 --> 07:57.218
And a graduate of A&M.

07:57.579 --> 08:06.150
So I waited up there one day and introduced myself to him and asked him if he'd give me a recommendation.

08:06.211 --> 08:07.452
So he wrote down there.

08:08.394 --> 08:10.597
So when I got here, I didn't have a job.

08:11.958 --> 08:12.139
No.

08:12.159 --> 08:19.389
But about a week after I got here, they called me up and told me that I had a job in Sabisa Hall.

08:19.809 --> 08:19.989
Right.

08:20.049 --> 08:24.816
Now that, when you arrived here, was what fall?

08:25.977 --> 08:29.844
The September of 94.

08:30.786 --> 08:31.607
I mean, I mean.

08:31.687 --> 08:33.711
Thirty-four.

08:33.972 --> 08:34.813
September of 1934.

08:35.514 --> 08:36.136
September.

08:36.937 --> 08:40.463
And it seemed to me like the day was the 18th, but I'll swear I'll never.

08:40.484 --> 08:42.387
How did you get down here from Vernon?

08:43.148 --> 08:43.930
On the train.

08:44.431 --> 08:50.061
I left there Sunday afternoon and arrived in here next morning

08:50.767 --> 08:57.115
at four-something o'clock in the morning there, it was black as bitch.

08:57.135 --> 09:03.543
And I didn't know which side of the A&M was on either side of the railroad track I did.

09:03.603 --> 09:05.466
So I just followed the boys.

09:06.787 --> 09:13.095
And I came up here to Walton Hall, which is a new—they had just built that hall.

09:14.136 --> 09:14.597
And

09:15.370 --> 09:20.296
I go in there and I had a suitcase and a radio.

09:21.297 --> 09:22.458
A little radio.

09:23.359 --> 09:26.242
And that's what I brought to Texas A&M.

09:26.262 --> 09:27.824
What did you have in the suitcase?

09:28.525 --> 09:37.796
I had a sheet and a quilt and a few of my clothes.

09:38.496 --> 09:39.638
And that's all I had.

09:40.459 --> 09:41.720
How much money did you bring?

09:41.780 --> 09:42.261
Do you remember?

09:42.281 --> 09:44.263
I had

09:45.003 --> 09:54.316
saved that next year around $300 and that was going to be my four years of education.

09:55.939 --> 10:03.370
I had, I just said, well, I'm going to make it somehow.

10:05.373 --> 10:09.819
And that started, I'm going to be an engineer.

10:11.702 --> 10:14.706
And hell, I didn't know what an engineer was, you know.

10:15.530 --> 10:18.112
They didn't teach me anything like that in high school.

10:19.373 --> 10:22.997
So it took me a year and a half to get smart enough to get out of that engineering.

10:23.037 --> 10:25.859
So I graduated.

10:25.879 --> 10:31.684
Then they had what they called a course in marketing and finance.

10:32.385 --> 10:37.690
And I think they've broken that down to many different divisions now.

10:38.450 --> 10:38.570
Right.

10:38.590 --> 10:43.815
When you first, that first day, who helped you find a place to,

10:44.487 --> 10:48.814
to sleep that night, who directed you to where you ought to go next?

10:49.375 --> 11:07.724
Well, that was, that was Monday morning, and they told us that we had to go over to the hospital and have an examination.

11:09.727 --> 11:12.351
So I looked, went over there and

11:13.225 --> 11:21.453
Seemed to me like they were about 1400 that, that year, freshman.

11:21.473 --> 11:37.809
And I got over there and I got up on top of the steps of the old hospital over there and I looked back down the way down there and I saw a boy that I used to run track with, against, and he was in Chillicothe.

11:38.470 --> 11:40.752
No one knows where Chillicothe is.

11:41.272 --> 11:52.443
But man, I tell you, I was happiest I believe I ever saw, seeing somebody that I knew that knew nothing about Edwin Garner.

11:54.085 --> 12:01.272
But anyway, he was going to be an engineer, too.

12:01.372 --> 12:09.540
And he graduated in engineering, agricultural engineering under her daddy right out there.

12:10.432 --> 12:20.907
So anyway, they invited us up and I was a freshman in Mitchell Hall.

12:22.329 --> 12:24.532
And that's where I stayed my freshman year.

12:24.893 --> 12:28.678
Describe your room in Mitchell Hall.

12:30.541 --> 12:39.173
Well, it was just a room with two beds and one table for both of us to study off of.

12:40.537 --> 12:49.814
And that mid-semester, we were appointed to have another roommate.

12:50.776 --> 12:56.446
So we called him Frog, and I don't remember what his last name was.

12:56.466 --> 13:04.401
But anyway, he put that bed, made it a three-tier bed.

13:06.068 --> 13:07.270
And that was something.

13:08.691 --> 13:16.502
And we had that for the rest of that, what, next May?

13:16.542 --> 13:26.915
And then that summer I had a friend that was going to North Texas there at Denton.

13:28.137 --> 13:31.702
And he wanted me to come up there and go to school with him that summer.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.687
So,

13:36.629 --> 13:42.817
I did, and I went up there, and I took 12 hours up there that summer.

13:43.638 --> 13:43.839
All right.

13:43.879 --> 13:45.741
Let's go back to this first fall, though.

13:47.864 --> 13:50.387
How did you sign up for your classes?

13:50.468 --> 13:52.811
How did you select what you were going to take?

13:53.131 --> 13:53.672
I didn't.

13:53.692 --> 13:55.074
They already had them for me.

13:57.317 --> 13:58.478
You had the chemistry.

13:59.079 --> 13:59.860
You had English.

14:00.341 --> 14:01.202
You had math.

14:05.300 --> 14:05.861
English.

14:06.942 --> 14:10.608
Yeah, you had English and you had chemistry and math.

14:11.670 --> 14:18.660
And you had 18 hours, I know.

14:18.680 --> 14:23.948
18 hours one semester and 19 hours the next semester.

14:23.968 --> 14:24.829
And you had.

14:25.651 --> 14:33.923
What did you, when you went to those classes the first day in each of them, how did you feel about the teacher and how they,

14:34.645 --> 14:35.406
started off?

14:36.328 --> 14:42.297
Well, I was, as I say, I was pretty ignorant.

14:42.317 --> 14:46.403
I didn't know much about this college business.

14:47.345 --> 15:00.265
But I can remember who I had my freshman year in English and I can remember

15:01.173 --> 15:02.235
Who I had.

15:02.295 --> 15:03.156
Who were they?

15:07.904 --> 15:09.046
We called them Jelly.

15:12.351 --> 15:12.731
Morgan?

15:14.154 --> 15:14.514
No.

15:19.562 --> 15:24.871
I'll get dressed in chemistry.

15:24.891 --> 15:25.712
We had a

15:26.587 --> 15:38.680
a student, advanced student, that took a lot of the responsibility of the chemistry.

15:38.700 --> 15:55.058
And math, a brown man, I can't remember his name, but when it all said and done over all those years, I'll remember a lot of them.

15:57.333 --> 16:02.100
What was a, describe that first semester, describe a typical day.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.086
What time did you get up and report for work and go to class and all that?

16:07.147 --> 16:22.429
Well, after I got that job, after I'd been here about a week and got a job as a waiter over in the Semise Hall, I would get up about

16:24.012 --> 16:31.503
or be ready to go to work over there so the kids go, we'd have tables all set.

16:32.825 --> 16:38.192
And when they marched in, then they had to march into every meal.

16:40.295 --> 16:46.845
And it was, it was just a long day.

16:47.285 --> 16:48.126
What time did you get out?

16:48.227 --> 16:48.627
Do you remember?

16:49.408 --> 16:50.610
Oh, about 6.30.

16:52.109 --> 16:56.174
to be there, be serving by seven.

16:57.495 --> 17:02.881
And so when I got back.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.605
When you finished breakfast, what?

17:05.625 --> 17:08.768
Well, I went to the different classes.

17:10.971 --> 17:18.880
One class I had was math, and it was a six-hour course.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.682
And you met that thing every day.

17:21.590 --> 17:23.572
Monday through Saturday morning.

17:24.734 --> 17:25.995
And ooh, I hated that claim.

17:27.337 --> 17:30.821
They don't have those six-hour courses anymore, I don't think.

17:30.901 --> 17:33.264
Now, then you went back to work at noon.

17:33.725 --> 17:34.225
At noon.

17:35.266 --> 17:38.590
And then about 5 o'clock we went back again.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.053
And we got out about 7.30 that night.

17:41.874 --> 17:47.261
And then we had to start studying.

17:47.281 --> 17:48.222
They made a study.

17:48.783 --> 17:51.546
And then we had to close the lights sale at 10 o'clock.

17:53.146 --> 17:57.672
We studied as we got off work.

17:57.692 --> 17:59.675
They're supposed to study anyway.

18:00.135 --> 18:02.458
Not all the time we wouldn't do it.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.825
But this, it was interesting.

18:09.648 --> 18:14.774
Now, your roommate, did you all call roommates then old ladies, fish old ladies?

18:15.035 --> 18:15.575
Oh, yes.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.538
Who was your, who was your fish?

18:17.558 --> 18:18.279
Jack Skaggs.

18:18.299 --> 18:19.000
Where was he from?

18:19.841 --> 18:21.022
From Plano, Texas.

18:22.504 --> 18:23.085
And Jack,

18:25.985 --> 18:28.169
was a lot smarter than I was.

18:30.633 --> 18:40.952
And he, I think he graduated, well, I lost him after my freshman year, but I saw him a lot.

18:42.154 --> 18:45.580
And he graduated, I believe, in chemical engineering.

18:45.830 --> 18:56.784
and went to work for Dow and graduated from Dow with a real, real good recommendation as one of their top men.

18:59.007 --> 19:06.256
And my son knew him, but he was a good one.

19:06.276 --> 19:09.981
And I don't know, I haven't seen Jack.

19:10.957 --> 19:16.269
When we had our reunions, I never saw him at one of our reunions.

19:17.171 --> 19:26.772
I was, but Higginbotham, Raymond Higginbotham, he made all of ours, and when he got out,

19:27.983 --> 19:34.994
He went to Hereford and he went here and he has there four different good jobs.

19:35.936 --> 19:47.494
And finally when he bought some land out at West Texas there somewhere and raised sugar beet.

19:50.782 --> 19:54.647
And he told me he made a lot of money on those sugar beets.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.290
But he passed away last year.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.473
What was it like to be a fish then?

19:58.513 --> 20:01.036
How did those sophomores treat you?

20:01.477 --> 20:02.258
Describe that.

20:02.799 --> 20:15.396
Well, you know, they would have these what they called air outs.

20:15.797 --> 20:20.383
About 12 o'clock at night, every so often they'd surprise you.

20:22.338 --> 20:34.516
open your door and air you out and get those Sam Browns after you and here you'd scoot anywhere you can to keep one beating you up.

20:35.718 --> 20:50.860
And we lived on the first floor, old Jack and I, and we'd open that screen and we'd hear them coming and we'd beat them, get them out that

20:51.599 --> 20:59.669
open that screen and we'd be gone until they got smart and they saw what was happening.

21:00.130 --> 21:04.235
So they went outside that screen and wait till we got out.

21:04.856 --> 21:13.186
And when they wanted something, all they'd do is go to the old door, you know, and holler, freshman.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.388
And then we'd have to go.

21:15.309 --> 21:18.433
The last one there had to do the errands, what he wanted.

21:19.122 --> 21:20.864
the upperclassmen wanted to do.

21:21.064 --> 21:22.185
What kind of errands?

21:22.546 --> 21:23.026
Anything.

21:23.667 --> 21:24.708
What were some examples?

21:24.908 --> 21:30.214
Well, for instance, the post office way down here by the railroad track.

21:30.234 --> 21:35.399
And that was the main thing, especially when it was cold and rainy.

21:35.419 --> 21:39.264
They'd have to go and pick up their mail if they had any.

21:40.225 --> 21:41.846
And that was the biggest problem.

21:41.866 --> 21:43.969
Other than that, well, just incidentals.

21:47.452 --> 21:48.133
And, uh.

21:49.463 --> 21:51.825
In the dining hall, you were working.

21:52.546 --> 21:56.730
How did the cadets behave in the dining hall in those days in Sabisa?

21:56.750 --> 22:10.884
Well, we had a little fellow by the name of Sergeant King, and he had charge of the employees of the waitresses.

22:10.924 --> 22:17.631
We were called waiters, and he thought that was pretty well taken care of.

22:20.108 --> 22:27.819
Now, my second half, they gave me a senior table.

22:29.140 --> 22:33.026
And they were treated first.

22:33.046 --> 22:39.855
And they got the first, uh, anything they wanted in the kitchen.

22:39.935 --> 22:48.006
We had, if they didn't have it there, we had to go back there and try to get them what they wanted.

22:49.927 --> 22:57.036
But I never had any problems with any of my tables.

23:01.782 --> 23:08.811
I guess I wasn't smart enough to do anything but what they wanted me to do.

23:10.654 --> 23:14.138
What were some of the nicknames that Aggies created for the food?

23:14.178 --> 23:16.221
Oh gosh.

23:19.458 --> 23:23.524
I just, you know, it's been so long.

23:23.624 --> 23:27.370
Cush I know was dessert, and milk was cow.

23:28.251 --> 23:37.285
Yeah, and I just, I can't remember that far back.

23:37.465 --> 23:41.271
I didn't know what some of them were called.

23:41.291 --> 23:43.274
What were the most popular foods?

23:43.595 --> 23:44.877
What were the favorites?

23:47.180 --> 23:48.402
What did everybody like best?

23:51.031 --> 23:52.733
You know, that's a good question.

23:55.296 --> 23:57.198
I really don't know.

23:57.219 --> 24:14.239
But when they had chili supper at night, I think that was one of their more popular items, which you would have about maybe once a week or something like that.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.443
When you brought food to the table,

24:17.744 --> 24:21.248
Were there any things that you had to be very careful about?

24:22.570 --> 24:25.573
You sure, not supposed to spill anything.

24:27.055 --> 24:28.397
If you did, what happened to you?

24:28.637 --> 24:29.298
That's bad.

24:32.161 --> 24:45.017
We had an old boy next to me, table next to me, spilt, we'd bring water in a big,

24:46.786 --> 24:55.896
bowl, and he had slipped out of that tray on, on the table and got everybody.

24:56.757 --> 25:09.892
Man, he caught demerit there for I don't know how long he was, he was in, in bad shape.

25:12.335 --> 25:12.675
But

25:14.832 --> 25:16.774
They were all, they weren't bad.

25:18.557 --> 25:20.179
Did they play games at the table?

25:21.020 --> 25:23.823
Well, not any of my tables, I didn't any.

25:24.904 --> 25:40.924
We had, as I say, my, my group, my first, second semester was all seniors and they were, they were a good bunch of,

25:43.148 --> 25:56.341
Man, they had the thought of getting out of there, you know, and they weren't much fooling around with them.

25:56.962 --> 25:58.343
When did you eat?

25:59.304 --> 25:59.724
After?

25:59.744 --> 26:01.226
After they were gone.

26:01.646 --> 26:03.288
And how long would it take you to eat a meal?

26:03.428 --> 26:12.497
Well, I had another friend that worked right next to one of the tables next to me.

26:12.933 --> 26:19.223
name of John Bone and a Wichita Falls boy and then a band.

26:19.263 --> 26:35.227
And we'd eat together and then we'd, if we'd see something that they didn't eat on another table, we'd go over and get some of it and eat what we, we always, we gained weight.

26:36.449 --> 26:38.351
What were your favorite Aggie foods?

26:38.952 --> 26:40.054
What did you enjoy most?

26:43.021 --> 26:52.996
Oh, I can't, I can't remember just what all I had.

26:53.196 --> 26:54.097
I really don't.

26:54.278 --> 26:55.379
Did you gain some weight?

26:56.080 --> 26:56.821
Oh, yeah.

26:58.023 --> 27:02.370
I went in there to, as a freshman, at 123 pounds.

27:03.111 --> 27:04.913
And I got out, I weighed about 150.

27:07.437 --> 27:11.543
But after I got back for the second

27:13.261 --> 27:27.381
year, I was working in the, in the, in the, in Sabisa Hall there, and I went up and introduced myself to Mr. Hotard, J.C.

27:27.421 --> 27:37.395
Hotard, and asked him if he ever had an opening next, across the street there in the old Aggieland Inn.

27:39.029 --> 27:42.654
So he said, yeah, I've got one right now.

27:42.674 --> 27:44.596
Would you like to go to work over there tomorrow?

27:45.858 --> 27:48.722
So I went to work Aggieland Inn the next day.

27:48.842 --> 27:51.746
I hadn't been here two weeks, I don't give.

27:52.046 --> 27:53.708
This is in the fall of your sophomore year.

27:53.789 --> 27:55.831
The fall of my sophomore year, right.

27:57.453 --> 28:00.738
And I stayed there until I graduated.

28:01.078 --> 28:02.160
Hmm.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.682
Describe your duties over there.

28:05.003 --> 28:08.428
Well, we, they had,

28:10.467 --> 28:21.720
They had a little coffee shop and a little dining room and we opened at the coffee shop.

28:21.820 --> 28:27.787
I went to work at 6 o'clock over there and opened the door at 6 o'clock in the coffee shop.

28:29.549 --> 28:39.580
And it stayed open until about 2.30 and then they opened again about 5 and stayed

28:40.268 --> 28:41.589
open until 7.30.

28:41.810 --> 28:50.038
And so, I would go to work.

28:51.179 --> 28:52.060
It'd be there.

28:52.100 --> 28:59.728
It'd open up at 6 o'clock, and I'd stay there until if I had an 8 o'clock class, I'd go then.

29:01.009 --> 29:01.550
Two hours.

29:01.610 --> 29:05.214
We had two hours in the morning, two hours at noon, and two hours at night.

29:05.234 --> 29:09.398
11.30 to 1.30.

29:10.643 --> 29:14.449
And 5.30 till 7.30.

29:15.791 --> 29:30.773
And that's what I did from 35 till I graduated in May of 38.

29:31.774 --> 29:33.317
Describe the Aggieland Inn.

29:33.417 --> 29:36.181
How big was it, how many rooms, and how it operated?

29:37.162 --> 29:40.347
Well, it was a three, do you ever remember that?

29:40.613 --> 29:42.455
No, it was gone before I got here.

29:42.615 --> 29:45.418
Oh, it was about a three-story building.

29:46.740 --> 29:53.287
And I would say it had about 30 rooms.

29:54.027 --> 29:55.028
West of Cebisa.

29:55.209 --> 29:56.750
Right across the street.

29:56.770 --> 29:58.953
Right across the street.

29:58.973 --> 30:03.718
And each of these rooms, by today's standards, would be double rooms?

30:03.738 --> 30:04.999
That is, it had a double?

30:05.019 --> 30:05.980
Most of them were.

30:06.483 --> 30:17.176
And in the middle of the room, that's where they had their, their, take their showers and things.

30:17.197 --> 30:20.200
They didn't have any showers in a room.

30:20.801 --> 30:22.303
Oh, so in the middle of the hallway?

30:22.423 --> 30:23.945
That's right.

30:23.965 --> 30:28.030
Had a hall go down there and then the showers and the commodes and all that.

30:28.050 --> 30:32.676
Kind of something like what they had in some of these dormitories.

30:34.377 --> 30:36.705
It had been built about having?

30:36.806 --> 30:39.616
You know, I have no idea when that was built.

30:39.817 --> 30:42.526
Did it seem old when you went to work there?

30:42.707 --> 30:43.972
Well, it was old.

30:44.253 --> 30:44.353
Okay.

30:44.907 --> 30:49.593
And I really hated to see that leave.

30:50.554 --> 30:51.715
They just tore it down.

30:52.096 --> 30:55.900
Mr. Hotard was responsible for all... He had charges of that.

30:56.401 --> 30:59.004
Duncan had charges of the police.

30:59.304 --> 31:00.986
Oh, okay.

31:01.006 --> 31:05.952
And did you all have your own kitchen for the Aggieland Inn?

31:06.433 --> 31:07.754
Did you cook over there?

31:09.136 --> 31:11.839
Yes, they had their own kitchen.

31:12.820 --> 31:13.581
And...

31:14.793 --> 31:29.288
had a sandwich place where they made sandwiches and others did all the cooking of the meats and steaks and all that kind of stuff.

31:30.249 --> 31:42.522
And we worked there six days a week, six hours a day, seven days a week, and got paid fifteen.
