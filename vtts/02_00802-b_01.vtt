WEBVTT

00:07.895 --> 00:09.597
No, back to how you became dean.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.925
Well, as I mentioned, I had no great aspirations to 
be a dean. I enjoyed what I was doing as an associate

00:19.687 --> 00:24.212
dean. When Dr. Price announced that he would like 
to step down from the deanship after 16 hard years,

00:38.067 --> 00:43.295
and be relieved of that responsibility and go back 
to teaching and doing some other things he'd like

00:38.067 --> 00:43.295
to do. I heard about it, never thought much about 
it. Somebody pitched my name in the hat. You didn't

00:53.910 --> 00:55.032
yourself? No. You didn't formally apply then? No.

01:02.302 --> 01:07.770
Seldom done for administrative posts of this 
nature. that I don't know who did. Somebody

01:11.138 --> 01:12.560
submitted my name. It probably was some people 
here that knew me. I had some former students who

01:15.904 --> 01:18.247
were here. Dr. Leon Russell down at the Public 
Health Department may have. I don't know who did.

01:24.175 --> 01:37.352
But sometime along in the late fall of 1972 or maybe 
early 1973, somebody, the search committee, I

01:24.175 --> 01:37.352
don't recall who was chairman of it, They 
contacted me and asked if I'd like to, if I would

01:38.513 --> 01:46.581
consider serving if I was named. So, you know, 
usually, well, I'll look at it, and I sent a CV

01:48.163 --> 01:58.394
sometime long late in 72 or early 73. I never 
thought much more about it. Then in the spring of

02:01.957 --> 02:08.284
73, I suppose April, I was invited for an interview 
But I knew that they were looking at a whole host of

02:09.142 --> 02:12.187
people. So even I came for an interview, I never 
thought very much about it.

02:20.441 --> 02:31.800
In the meantime, the dean at the University of 
Missouri had resigned,

02:20.441 --> 02:31.800
I guess not too long after Dr. Price did. So they 
started a search committee up there, too. So along

02:37.610 --> 02:50.263
through

02:37.610 --> 02:50.263
the spring of 1973, I knew that I was out of 
consideration, both here and at Missouri. And I

02:50.283 --> 02:52.926
didn't have any idea if I'd be selected either 
place. And Denver didn't really care. So

02:55.149 --> 03:05.119
it went on then until early summer, I suppose about 
1st of July. And then one day out of the blue, Dr.

03:06.888 --> 03:18.645
John Calhoun called me and said that I was one of 
three that they had centered on. So he wanted to

03:18.665 --> 03:30.283
know if I would come to Dallas and meet with him and 
Dr. Williams and a couple of members of the Board of

03:18.665 --> 03:30.283
Regents. And I did sometime early July. I remember 
that Mr. Wells and Mr. Wittenberg, who was on the

03:37.060 --> 03:53.920
Board of Regents at that time, and well-known to 
the livestock industry, cattlemen's group and so

03:37.060 --> 03:53.920
forth. I remember those two gentlemen were there 
that day. So I flew down and met with them and still

03:57.924 --> 04:02.950
didn't know where it was all going to wind up. but 
did have a very nice meeting, I thought. Did they

04:08.606 --> 04:11.990
ask you about plans that you might have for the vet 
school? Yes, they did. They were very concerned

04:13.232 --> 04:34.776
then about the food animal program, as we still are 
after seven to eight years later, but they were

04:13.232 --> 04:34.776
concerned about that, and they were concerned 
very much about trying to strengthen the clinical

04:13.232 --> 04:34.776
parts of the college, and so then I went on Back 
home, really never. I assumed at that time that at

04:37.645 --> 04:43.250
least there was a good bit of interest in me. And 
then one day, about middle of July, Dr. Calhoun

04:44.952 --> 04:50.377
called and offered me the position. And so then 
about almost the same time, I was offered a

04:51.998 --> 04:59.646
position at Missouri. Where in? Yes. Almost in the 
same week. And I was called to meet with the

05:05.688 --> 05:10.294
chancellor and the president of that university. 
And I actually didn't know where I was going. That

05:14.881 --> 05:16.883
must have been a very difficult decision for you. 
It really was. It was a difficult decision because

05:18.045 --> 05:22.091
Missouri was home. I had close friends, close ties 
there. And of course, Texas A&M was my alma mater.

05:32.485 --> 05:36.090
Of course, we still had family and so forth in 
Texas, so it was very difficult. I thought the

05:37.291 --> 05:41.897
opportunity for me was a little better in Texas, 
better resources. And I could already see the

05:43.419 --> 05:48.405
financial restraints in Missouri. They had been 
settling in on us for the last two or three years

05:48.445 --> 05:56.615
there before I left, since about 1970, in fact. So 
finally, I elected to come to Texas. And it wasn't

06:03.535 --> 06:06.137
an easy decision. Also, I've long since, and I 
still do, believe that an administrator has a

06:07.138 --> 06:14.045
little... It's difficult, in all honesty, to take 
over a school where you have been one of the men, one

06:15.927 --> 06:25.075
of the troops, for long years. It's very difficult 
because you can't be very objective. You really

06:31.818 --> 06:35.902
can't weigh the pros and cons of your faculty. In 
other words, you think it would have been more

06:37.143 --> 06:42.869
difficult for you to take over Missouri because 
you had been a faculty member for so long.

06:43.009 --> 06:45.931
Substantially more difficult. It really is. 
That's a good point. Where here, you didn't know

06:49.835 --> 06:51.437
most of the people. I didn't know them that well. 
You still had some contacts, though. I could be far

06:53.338 --> 06:54.680
more objective. But there are some, as we 
mentioned before, Nothing is all one way or the

07:00.927 --> 07:02.689
other. And the counter side of that argument, or 
not an argument, a viewpoint, is that when you come

07:02.990 --> 07:17.129
in from an outside and you come in as dean, you're 
always the dean. And you never have close friends.

07:22.616 --> 07:27.863
Because people don't want to, usually they don't 
want to become very close friends with you.

07:28.535 --> 07:33.242
Because they're always afraid their peers will 
think that they're seeking special favor. And so

07:34.884 --> 07:40.853
when you come in from the outside and assume a 
deanship or a presidency, it's a lonely job. You

07:41.875 --> 07:44.619
never have close friends. I never thought of that. 
Very lonely. You're always the dean. There's some

07:52.049 --> 07:55.234
kind of a feeling they keep you at arm's length.

07:57.965 --> 08:00.269
And I'm a human sort of person. I like people. And 
that's kind of a lonely position. I've never been

08:08.522 --> 08:10.024
one. And I remember my old dean at Missouri who 
recommended me for a number of jobs. And I didn't

08:19.259 --> 08:22.825
know that he ever said this until years later. and I 
don't know whether it was here or somewhere else,

08:24.914 --> 08:29.220
and he sent a recommendation. And he said, well, he 
has all the qualifications to do the job, but I'm

08:30.221 --> 08:40.194
not sure he can ever be tough enough. And I found out 
that he said that later in years. And I understand

08:46.382 --> 08:47.664
it. I thought it was a fair and very valid 
observation, but that's not my nature. Sometimes

08:56.335 --> 08:59.340
I have trouble being tough enough. Now, when you 
came down and assumed the deanship, did you have

08:59.360 --> 09:13.783
definite aims or goals, set up, criterias that you 
wanted to accomplish, ways in which you wanted to

08:59.360 --> 09:13.783
shift the focus or move the vet school? Only 
generally. I wanted to strengthen the clinical

09:15.426 --> 09:18.531
program. That was my main and major objective.

09:23.808 --> 09:30.798
That was partly my objective and partly what I was 
told by the Board of Regents.

09:31.378 --> 09:35.204
So I have made every effort to do that. I didn't have 
a lot of preconceived opinions because I had seen a

09:37.687 --> 09:52.988
number of administrators come into an 
administrative post and start making decisions,

09:37.687 --> 09:52.988
changing policies, changing directions, before 
they really knew the inside. And I did not want to do

09:57.551 --> 10:00.355
that. I did not want to do that. So I came in and I 
tried to, number one, learn what my faculty was

10:02.697 --> 10:15.912
like, what the internal operation was like, what 
the organization was like, who I could trust, who I

10:02.697 --> 10:15.912
couldn't, who would perform and who didn't. So I 
didn't come in with a lot of preconceived ideas,

10:17.654 --> 10:22.840
except generally, to do two things, strengthen 
the clinical program and strengthen the research

10:23.208 --> 10:28.473
program. Because I perceive both of them were very 
weak when I came here. OK, we're going to talk about

10:32.797 --> 10:34.038
those. But as we both realize, the major changes 
happened under Dr. Price with the admittance of

10:34.539 --> 10:46.290
blacks and women and a great expansion over those 
years, especially concerning women. Was there

10:47.291 --> 10:49.873
any residue when you because of that decision when 
you came in a few years later. I mean, were there any

10:53.772 --> 11:01.520
feelings against women, or were there having any 
problems with women students, or anything like

10:53.772 --> 11:01.520
that, or new women faculty members? Well, we've 
tried to add as many as we could, but they were so

11:03.342 --> 11:06.365
scarce. They hadn't been trained to be faculty 
members. No. There was, perhaps, the first couple

11:13.012 --> 11:17.397
of years I was here, There may have been a little 
feeling on the part of some of the older faculty

11:18.052 --> 11:28.266
members against the explosion in the numbers of 
women. I never really felt it very much. And I

11:32.292 --> 11:36.097
couldn't even identify individuals who felt that 
way. So if there was, it didn't really matter? It

11:38.621 --> 11:40.123
was kind of hidden, subtle. But I'm sure there was a 
feeling that we were getting too many women in

11:42.026 --> 11:47.113
school. But I don't think it was ever a major 
problem. And still isn't? No. Any feelings that

11:53.888 --> 11:58.113
might have been a decline then over the years? Oh, 
yes. If there was a feeling that some of the older

12:00.376 --> 12:12.672
faculty members, people like Dr. Bill Romaine, 
Dr. Jim Denton over in the clinic who, and I don't

12:00.376 --> 12:12.672
know that they did, but it was human. They had been 
there on the firing line with the finished

12:12.992 --> 12:17.758
product. And I think it was very human that they 
might have felt a little apprehension, but that's

12:17.840 --> 12:24.869
all gone now. I heard Dr. Romaine just last year, he 
serves on the selections committee now, and he

12:26.291 --> 12:37.265
said, you know, I never thought I'd admit it, but 
the women work harder in clinics than the men do.

12:37.785 --> 12:38.907
Really? Mm-hmm. So, yeah, it's all gone. It's been 
really a revolution. One-third of your student

12:43.072 --> 12:44.634
body are women. Mm-hmm. And there's never been a 
system of quotas or anything like that, has there?

12:52.542 --> 12:59.339
Back in the early to mid-'70s, they just started 
looking at Canada. No quotas, no nothing. Never

13:02.447 --> 13:03.169
been any. And there's none toward blacks or browns 
either. However, we're having trouble getting

13:07.371 --> 13:10.380
qualified minorities. Yeah, let's switch to that 
right now. That's been probably a concern ever

13:12.567 --> 13:17.361
since you've come here, like you said, the federal 
government. and the state government could put

13:18.117 --> 13:21.822
some pressure on you. Why don't we get blacks here? 
I think we've only had one, as a matter of fact, one

13:24.185 --> 13:27.069
graduate. One graduate, and two that ever been 
admitted. One was admitted, I don't remember,

13:31.075 --> 13:36.943
back about mid-60s, and never did complete his 
work. I don't know why. I don't know if he failed

13:37.584 --> 13:38.725
out. No, I don't think he actually failed out. I 
think he became discouraged and dropped out. The

13:45.168 --> 13:48.251
question of why. Now, through the years, we've had 
some Brown students. Hispanics, there were

13:53.857 --> 13:57.220
Hispanics in school when I was here. Sure. And as 
far as I know, never any feeling that there

13:58.762 --> 14:04.407
shouldn't be. I think always a positive feeling 
toward Hispanics in school. Now, we never had

14:10.153 --> 14:11.334
great numbers. Yeah. But we've always had some. 
They still do. There were five Hispanic students

14:17.134 --> 14:21.960
admitted in the class last year. And I think that 
was out of 12. There were 12 applicants, and five

14:23.783 --> 14:32.475
were admitted, which was higher than with the 
Caucasians or whites. Well, anyhow,

14:33.617 --> 14:42.289
the reason for the blacks, they're twofold. One, 
they're not unique to Texas A&M. No other state

14:46.711 --> 14:52.281
land grant school is overwhelmed with black 
applicants either. But most of them are doing

14:53.122 --> 14:55.106
better than we are. I think if you took all the 25 
schools that are in operation now, we'd be down

14:55.867 --> 15:08.810
close to the bottom as far as being able to attract 
black students. Who would be close to the top? Ohio

15:10.453 --> 15:11.054
State? Cornell?

15:14.200 --> 15:28.422
Strangely enough, throughout the years, through 
the whole years, now I can't say the last five

15:14.200 --> 15:28.422
years, but through the history, Kansas State and 
Iowa State have had more black graduates than any

15:14.200 --> 15:28.422
other state. No kidding, that is unusual. Yeah, 
and I don't know why. I think early on, way back

15:32.468 --> 15:42.283
there, when old men like Dr. Evans, who was 
president of Prairie View so many years, was a

15:32.468 --> 15:42.283
veterinarian. I think way back there, they took a 
few black men into school, and they did well. Like

15:49.983 --> 15:55.489
the dean at Tuskegee for so many years, Dr. 
Williams, was a Kansas State graduate. I think

15:56.850 --> 16:10.363
that they kind of got an image early, and a few young 
black men that would go to veterinary school said,

15:56.850 --> 16:10.363
wait, I went to K-State, and I was treated well, and 
I got through, and I don't know what it was. But to

16:10.664 --> 16:16.172
build an image early on, I guess, and maybe a few 
eminent men, I don't know what it was. Now,

16:18.395 --> 16:34.638
California, a very progressive state, started a 
very vigorous black recruitment program back

16:18.395 --> 16:34.638
about 70, or maybe even 68, 70, somewhere along 
there. And I heard... Dean Pritchard say at a

16:36.584 --> 16:52.238
meeting long about 75, 76, he said we have spent 
untold amount of faculty hours and finance and

16:36.584 --> 16:52.238
everything else trying to recruit blacks and we 
don't have anything to show for it. No kidding.

16:53.519 --> 16:56.041
California has a sizable black population. 
Pretty good size and it's progressive, you know,

16:56.061 --> 17:00.746
it has a national image of being progressive. This 
is at UC Davis? UC Davis. I think UC Davis have had

17:05.795 --> 17:09.561
maybe a few more than we've had. Maybe altogether 
they've had seven or eight graduates, black

17:09.861 --> 17:13.306
graduates. But they haven't done very well. And at 
least, Dean Pritchard said, compared to the

17:14.949 --> 17:22.900
effort we spent, our success rate's been woefully 
inadequate. But to get back to- So no one's doing

17:24.763 --> 17:28.609
very well. No one's doing very well. No, that's 
right. Because most of the blacks are still going

17:32.314 --> 17:34.958
to Tuskegee. The honest truth is no. No one is doing 
very well. But unfortunately, we are not even

17:39.980 --> 17:44.366
doing as well as some of the others. Do any whites go 
to Tuskegee? Yes. About 40% of the class is white.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.296
Really? They only take about 60 a year. And I think 
about 20 are white. So, yes, they do. They can't get

18:00.527 --> 18:02.190
enough blacks to fill their class. Really? And 
they recruit vigorously. from places like

18:05.110 --> 18:06.372
Prairie View. And we've been, last year or so, 
we've been working pretty hard trying to build our

18:07.494 --> 18:13.304
image at Prairie View. It's partly, I guess, 
response to the federal pressure, but

18:15.888 --> 18:23.400
I don't know. Our first efforts were, maybe they 
were inadequate on our part, but they didn't

18:23.600 --> 18:30.612
receive much encouragement at Prairie View. uh dr 
bay would go down and present a program on

18:32.380 --> 18:57.932
opportunities in veterinary medicine and so 
forth to a group of students at prairie view and we

18:32.380 --> 18:57.932
got some pretty stony looks and not much 
enthusiasm and more recently we've had dr thomas

18:32.380 --> 18:57.932
has thrown his weight behind it and we're getting a 
different reaction now why is that i think because

18:32.380 --> 18:57.932
the president says uh we want to We want to try to 
build a prevent program and get some students in

18:58.840 --> 19:03.726
it, Texas A&M. And I think his visibility, his 
prestige, kind of caught on. And now the dean of

19:09.092 --> 19:16.341
agriculture and the head of biology department 
and so forth, they began to work with us and talk to

19:09.092 --> 19:16.341
us. OK, so the first one was that no university is 
doing very well. That's true. What was your other

19:20.526 --> 19:21.928
one? Well, the other point is Texas A&M doesn't 
have a good image among blacks in Texas. Right. And

19:30.578 --> 19:33.201
that's just everybody. They just don't think 
they're... I don't know. It's so conservative, I

19:38.708 --> 19:46.156
guess, and so militaristic, and so maybe in their 
eyes, redneck, and I don't know what else. I'm not a

19:47.478 --> 19:50.441
sociologist enough to understand. But Black 
students don't look on Texas A&M as a place they

19:52.621 --> 19:58.707
want to go. Exceptions, of course. So I think we've 
had to overcome that. And I have to be absolutely

20:03.472 --> 20:07.456
honest. I've had an awful lot of problems with 
Texas A&M. A lot of things I had to devote my

20:11.140 --> 20:12.982
attention to. The Texas Southwestern cattle 
raisers were on our backs because we weren't

20:13.022 --> 20:21.210
getting enough rural kids in school.

20:22.456 --> 20:29.086
Pressures from here and there, in other words, to 
try to move ahead. And we've had an unbelievable

20:29.326 --> 20:40.182
problem with our admission system because people 
can't understand why their sons and daughters

20:29.326 --> 20:40.182
can't get in school. Well, let's talk about these. 
This is the next thing I want to talk about. And

20:43.807 --> 20:47.753
these are the challenges that you've had since 73. 
Let's talk about these right now. For example, the

20:50.937 --> 20:52.159
pressures. Well, who are the people that have been 
pressuring the vet school? They've been heavy for

20:57.047 --> 20:59.811
admissions. That's perhaps the greatest 
pressure. And they've come from every which

21:03.456 --> 21:08.063
place, every direction. They come from 
veterinarians whose sons and daughters who know

21:08.083 --> 21:20.461
that their son and their daughter were far better 
qualified for admission than they were in the

21:08.083 --> 21:20.461
1940s, 50s, and 60s. And so why can't Susie or Bill 
get admitted? And I understand, but they don't.

21:28.536 --> 21:37.745
They don't stop and realize that there are 500 to 
600 highly qualified young people every year, and

21:28.536 --> 21:37.745
we can only take 138. And so why? They 
intellectually can accept it, but internalize,

21:41.449 --> 21:48.316
they can't. They can't internalize it. It's a 
proud father. So we've had a lot of that sort of

21:51.479 --> 21:53.601
thing. We've had a lot of pressure from the 
livestock producers who are saying that what

21:54.239 --> 22:04.973
we're doing is educating a lot of dog and cat 
doctors. I see. And that we're not educating young

22:06.515 --> 22:17.309
people willing to go back to the ports of the 
branch, to the towns with the last picture show

22:06.515 --> 22:17.309
image, and practice. Get out to the ranch. Yeah, it 
is tough. In Texas, there's a lot of areas in Texas

22:24.243 --> 22:32.291
where veterinary service is not very good, and the 
cattle raisers can't understand why the young

22:24.243 --> 22:32.291
people don't stay out there. But they can't make a 
living. Or they can't make a very good living. They

22:37.596 --> 22:41.820
have to sit in a pickup all day and drive 30 and 40 
miles on the call. And their wives have to live in a

22:41.860 --> 22:50.689
small town with an inadequate school system. And 
shopping centers are not much good. Educational

22:53.980 --> 22:56.403
systems are not very good. So we've had a lot to 
overcome there. So the pressures from that group

23:01.008 --> 23:02.950
have been. Then more recently, pressures from the 
minorities. Well, in what way are the minorities?

23:12.240 --> 23:15.343
I mean, are you having office calls from? Corps or 
NAACP or something like that? Not any of them. Have

23:20.432 --> 23:20.793
you? One of the real parts of the people, one of the 
individuals that's really been on this route

23:21.614 --> 23:37.201
recently is a lady from the Houston area, 
Wilhelmina Delco, who is a member of the

23:21.614 --> 23:37.201
legislature from Houston area. And she'd been on 
the university over at Prairie View anyway. So she

23:40.636 --> 23:42.999
found a weakness. She found a little Achilles heel 
because we haven't had any blacks. And she's angry

23:47.245 --> 23:52.291
that A&M over Prairie View anyway, so she's using 
us as kind of a whipping boy. But yes, we've had a

23:54.054 --> 24:10.255
good bed of politicians after us over the minority 
from both, not so much the LULAC group, the Browns,

23:54.054 --> 24:10.255
because they really can't build a very good case 
against us. We can show them that we've taken a good

24:10.538 --> 24:17.388
number of the Brown students that have applied. 
But we don't have a good defense when we say we've

24:17.408 --> 24:25.339
had one black here since the whole history of the 
school. We've graduated 3,600 veterinarians and

24:26.220 --> 24:32.209
one black.

24:33.455 --> 24:36.298
In spite of the fact that we can see the reasons, 
it's hard to defend. How many blacks applied last

24:36.318 --> 24:38.321
year? One. That made the minimum. One young woman, 
academic score was something like 473 out of 483.

24:50.815 --> 24:52.977
So she was so far down, she didn't get an interview. 
But then she reported us to the Office of

24:54.559 --> 24:57.522
Education. Oh, I say she did. Let me back up. 
Somebody did. I would guess it was her or someone

25:02.260 --> 25:05.823
that knew her. So earlier we were talking about the 
reporting. We filed about seven reports with the

25:10.407 --> 25:13.250
Office of Education. Just dealing with that one 
particular case, seven reports? Oh, five or six or

25:17.934 --> 25:19.616
seven. Well, a number of reports. Several, yeah. 
Discussing that situation and why she was there.

25:25.801 --> 25:29.905
Justifying it, giving all kinds of background 
data about our program. And of course we've had

25:31.015 --> 25:34.942
that pretty well because we have learned that we 
have to have it. So we can drag out the statistics on

25:35.844 --> 25:44.759
the numbers of applicants, number of 
qualifications, how they were selected. We've

25:45.360 --> 25:53.074
gone to a highly mechanized system of selection 
just in our own defense.

25:55.568 --> 25:59.434
OK, let's talk about other pressures, not only 
minorities and livestock groups. And people were

25:59.494 --> 26:01.617
upset about admissions. Any other ones? Well, 
there was a lot of upset about our clinical

26:03.340 --> 26:06.705
program. A lot of veterinarians and livestock 
people were saying that our graduates were not

26:06.886 --> 26:19.005
capable of entering the modern day field of 
agribusiness and in herd health management. And

26:19.866 --> 26:21.829
there was some truth to their arguments. Because 
of the curriculum, or why weren't they prepared?

26:27.434 --> 26:51.630
Well, it's curriculum, and it's a philosophical 
problem that it's very difficult to educate the

26:27.434 --> 26:51.630
young person to handle the individual case, the 
concept of medicine that we've always had, where

26:27.434 --> 26:51.630
the youngster has to first learn what the normal 
animal is, what the sick animal is, how to make a

26:51.830 --> 27:04.764
differential diagnosis, and then apply 
treatment, therapy, and recommendations for

26:51.830 --> 27:04.764
correction. So that is basically what the 
veterinary student has to learn. Now, as a result

27:10.511 --> 27:21.803
of the change in agriculture and as a result of the 
loss of the family farm, the veterinarian no

27:10.511 --> 27:21.803
longer can practice the kind of medicine that he or 
she could have in 1950, the kind of thing that James

27:22.610 --> 27:48.260
Heratt talks about in All Creatures Great and 
Small, where the individually sick animal, and

27:22.610 --> 27:48.260
veterinarians refer to this as emergency 
practice, or they use another term, fire engine

27:22.610 --> 27:48.260
practice, where you just respond to emergencies, 
which is what veterinarians did up until 20 years

27:22.610 --> 27:48.260
ago. Then comes the shift away from the small 
family farms, either to big family farms or

27:51.398 --> 28:09.373
industrial farms, factory farms, whatever you 
call them, where they're highly specialized and a

27:51.398 --> 28:09.373
farm may have

27:51.398 --> 28:09.373
half a million or $200,000 chicks or laying hens or 
turkeys, or they may keep 300 sows, brood sows, or

28:10.383 --> 28:24.137
they go to enormous numbers of cattle and feed 
yards or own ranches and farms. And so all of a

28:25.418 --> 28:33.065
sudden we are looking at herd health medicine, 
emphasis on prevention rather than treatment.

28:34.407 --> 28:38.871
Well, that creates a dichotomy in the educational 
process. Number one, the first thing you have to do

28:39.037 --> 28:47.105
is to teach the youngster the normal animal and how 
to diagnose a sick animal. Then he or she has to

28:47.125 --> 28:56.634
become a consultant, you might say, a medical 
management person. And in order to do that, how can

28:58.016 --> 29:03.641
you do that all in four years? And so that's the 
dilemma we've been struggling with. And that's

29:07.606 --> 29:11.371
why we've made a lot of changes on our clinical 
program. OK. For example, what type of changes?

29:14.296 --> 29:29.958
Well, we shifted the curriculum to a block system, 
or a segmented system, where the old system

29:14.296 --> 29:29.958
students would go to school, and they'd have 
surgery Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. And

29:30.018 --> 29:36.668
they'd have infectious diseases Tuesday, 
Thursday, and these kinds of things, which kept

29:30.018 --> 29:36.668
them on campus. all time. So we shifted to a block 
system of education. And they'll have five weeks

29:42.874 --> 29:49.943
of surgery, or they'll have five weeks of small 
animal medicine, or this or that. And in the

29:50.643 --> 29:59.073
five-week span, they'll have five weeks that they 
can devote to an externship and a five-week that

29:50.643 --> 29:59.073
they can devote to an elective. And this allows us 
to get the students off campus, into educational

30:00.014 --> 30:05.541
experiences off campus. Because you can't teach 
it all. On-the-job training. More on-the-job

30:08.393 --> 30:11.578
training than is what we're, yeah. You can't teach 
it all on campus. It just can't be done in a big

30:14.902 --> 30:17.526
teaching hospital. The teaching hospital has a 
certain role. It's a good role to learn diagnostic

30:20.470 --> 30:26.839
medicine, comparative diagnosis, that kind of 
thing. They can learn all about the latest

30:26.860 --> 30:35.612
techniques in radiology, nuclear medicine, 
anesthesiology, all these things. Especially in

30:36.284 --> 30:42.530
the food animal medicine and in herd health 
management, the student has to get off campus. So

30:43.591 --> 30:54.302
we now have training programs and resident 
teachers in the Texas Department of Corrections

30:43.591 --> 30:54.302
at Sugar Land and at Huntsville. And we have 
teachers there. And now we have a training

30:55.843 --> 31:02.710
teaching program at Amarillo in the feed yards in 
the intensive livestock production. And

31:02.730 --> 31:04.992
students can go there for two to five weeks. They go 
to the prison one week, rotation. They can rotate

31:08.269 --> 31:11.475
back through again if they want. So we've 
broadened our exposure. But even in spite of it

31:16.144 --> 31:27.165
all, we still cannot teach these youngsters to be 
herd health managers and livestock disease

31:16.144 --> 31:27.165
consultants.
