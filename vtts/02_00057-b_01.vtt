WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:07.577
days, five days at the most because we had to be back for basketball practice.

00:07.598 --> 00:15.859
And I do remember hitchhiking back from Abilene so I could be back in time to resume the basketball practice.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.584
Describe hitchhiking as an Aggie.

00:18.070 --> 00:22.039
Well, that's something I have a lot of experience with.

00:22.821 --> 00:25.688
That's the way we got around, and it was easy, really.

00:26.109 --> 00:34.729
Never had a really bad experience hitchhiking, and I wouldn't know how many miles or how many times I hitchhiked, but it was a lot.

00:34.709 --> 00:40.341
Normally the route from here to Abilene or vice versa, how did you go?

00:40.561 --> 00:43.928
Well, I didn't hitchhike to Abilene many times.

00:43.968 --> 00:46.373
Now that was a pretty far trek to hitchhike.

00:47.475 --> 00:50.642
Mostly I went to Dallas or

00:51.128 --> 00:56.555
My wife Evelyn, she was from a little town of Hamilton, which is about 60 miles west of Waco.

00:57.416 --> 01:00.500
But hitchhiking from College Station to Waco was easy.

01:01.401 --> 01:04.004
Where did you go to catch the first ride from here?

01:05.546 --> 01:06.347
Physically, where?

01:07.709 --> 01:11.373
Well, it was up on, you know, I'm trying to think.

01:11.394 --> 01:13.516
There was pretty much a standard place we went.

01:13.576 --> 01:16.260
I'm trying to picture exactly where that was.

01:16.300 --> 01:20.545
It was over on Highway 6 somewhere, but it seemed like it was.

01:21.098 --> 01:24.186
It's not too far, but I can't remember exactly.

01:24.206 --> 01:30.142
I know going to Houston, it was the southwest corner at Eastgate.

01:30.242 --> 01:31.024
Right.

01:31.207 --> 01:32.629
But I don't know about going north.

01:32.649 --> 01:34.492
It was on up the way there.

01:34.612 --> 01:35.513
It wasn't far.

01:35.634 --> 01:36.114
I know that.

01:36.174 --> 01:44.567
It wasn't, you know, we sometimes could get somebody to take us up there to where we, we all hitchhiked, you know, we had the same place.

01:45.248 --> 01:49.614
And you stood in line there and you always wore your uniform.

01:49.634 --> 01:53.500
Always wore the uniform and have a little bag or something at TAM on it.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.902
But no sign.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.847
No, no sign.

01:57.729 --> 02:07.474
We might have a little TAM bag or something, but I don't ever remember having a sign or anything.

02:08.197 --> 02:14.968
But you waited your turn to be number one and, you know, only one person.

02:14.988 --> 02:18.033
They told us early on, now, you know, you don't all stand out there and do this.

02:18.073 --> 02:21.819
You know, there's one person standing at the front of the line that's doing the hitchhiking.

02:22.840 --> 02:28.990
And some car stops and he says, I'm going to Calvert.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.984
And the first guy says, I'll take that.

02:32.045 --> 02:33.587
Or no, I think I'll wait.

02:34.409 --> 02:35.631
I'm trying to get to Dallas.

02:37.134 --> 02:44.447
So the next guy falls down the way there for people to accept or reject it.

02:45.457 --> 02:50.563
But it always worked, and people were very happy to pick us up.

02:51.284 --> 02:53.406
And usually we didn't have to wait too long.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.530
And I said I never had a bad experience.

02:57.170 --> 03:00.674
Give some examples of plus and minus experiences.

03:01.816 --> 03:09.304
A couple of negative kind of experiences.

03:09.942 --> 03:22.138
I remember catching a ride, I was going up to Hamilton to see my wife or girlfriend then on Saturday and I usually went on Saturday because we had classes until noon on Saturday.

03:22.778 --> 03:36.456
You might later on in your four years, you might be able to manage to avoid Saturday classes, which I did I think maybe a time or two, but generally we're talking about Saturday hitchhiking.

03:37.600 --> 03:43.625
But I caught this one ride and I think it went over here to about Hearn, somewhere over in that area.

03:44.646 --> 04:07.287
And I got out and then I started hitchhiking there by myself and not having any immediate success and this big new Oldsmobile 98 stopped by and this guy picked me up and I was in the back seat and I could tell he'd been drinking some.

04:08.684 --> 04:11.468
And he was gunning that Oldsmobile.

04:11.529 --> 04:20.303
And I remember going through that blinking red light or yellow light down in Riesel, that little town of Riesel or Reagan, I forget which it is, up this side of Waco.

04:20.823 --> 04:22.366
Got a blinking yellow light there.

04:22.987 --> 04:27.714
And I remember going through that light and looked down and he was doing 95 miles an hour.

04:28.516 --> 04:31.601
I thought, man, if I survive this, I'm going to be lucky.

04:32.402 --> 04:33.223
But we made it.

04:33.584 --> 04:35.046
He let me out in Waco.

04:36.157 --> 04:39.041
I've had times when people would ask me to drive.

04:40.042 --> 04:41.284
I thought that was interesting.

04:41.344 --> 04:41.985
I've done that.

04:44.048 --> 04:51.978
One time I was having, things were a little slow, and I caught a ride with a big old transport truck, one of these big gasoline transport trucks.

04:51.998 --> 04:54.622
And I remember sitting up there with this driver.

04:55.703 --> 05:00.730
It was rough and hot and all that, but, you know, it worked fine.

05:01.013 --> 05:02.355
Most of them are very positive.

05:02.415 --> 05:04.158
People enjoy talking to you.

05:04.218 --> 05:12.190
They seem to respect what you're doing, who you are, and they just enjoy visiting with you.

05:12.571 --> 05:14.974
Some of them really want to be helpful.

05:14.994 --> 05:26.532
The worst hitchhiking stories I've heard are somebody drinking too much, and a couple times people said they thought...

05:26.883 --> 05:32.011
some man was trying to put their arm around them a little too much, and they kind of slid away.

05:32.431 --> 05:33.713
I never ran into that.

05:33.753 --> 05:36.217
Nothing beyond that.

05:37.198 --> 05:41.725
Did you ever, were you ever part of a crowd that filled a car?

05:42.126 --> 05:42.486
Oh, yes.

05:42.887 --> 05:43.928
I've been in with several.

05:44.729 --> 05:47.293
You know, four or five, you know, just packed in there.

05:48.054 --> 05:48.435
Oh, yes.

05:48.936 --> 05:49.517
I've done that.

05:49.857 --> 05:53.903
And there were certain places that gradually you learned

05:54.237 --> 05:56.720
where the Aggie hitchhiking location was.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.624
Is that right?

05:59.644 --> 05:59.784
Mm-hmm.

05:59.804 --> 06:04.270
But I remember hitchhiking back from Hamilton, which is up on Highway 36.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.934
That's a road going on out west.

06:06.994 --> 06:16.827
But late on Sunday evening, and you'd think it might be hard to catch a ride, but it seemed like it always worked.

06:16.947 --> 06:19.791
Did you ever get stuck anywhere in the wee hours of night?

06:19.811 --> 06:20.152
Never.

06:21.674 --> 06:21.794
Okay.

06:21.814 --> 06:24.177
Never got stuck overnight that I couldn't make it.

06:25.034 --> 06:31.326
When you went home Christmas, what did you tell your folks about A&M that first year?

06:33.089 --> 06:35.814
Well, I spoke to them in very positive terms.

06:35.915 --> 06:36.416
I know that.

06:36.816 --> 06:37.177
I didn't.

06:38.039 --> 06:39.702
And you never thought about dropping out?

06:39.722 --> 06:41.646
Never once thought about dropping out.

06:42.888 --> 06:47.717
But they, you know, had heard enough.

06:48.203 --> 06:53.749
Well, they knew something about A&M from other people, from the Pitsers that I mentioned earlier.

06:54.770 --> 07:02.599
So they kinda knew what to expect, I think, but I didn't give them any bad stories.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.583
They again were encouraging to me.

07:08.926 --> 07:14.532
And was the Korean War, was it being interjected into your thinking?

07:14.672 --> 07:16.995
Very much so, very much so.

07:17.650 --> 07:25.666
The Korean War was really heating up, of course, in 1950, 52, 53, that was the period.

07:25.706 --> 07:32.179
And, you know, we didn't know what was going to happen there.

07:32.219 --> 07:38.511
You know, we still remembered World War II and, you know, we kind of expected this full mobilization.

07:39.301 --> 07:40.863
you know, a total commitment.

07:40.903 --> 07:46.431
And, you know, it's kind of shocking to us, some of us, that, hey, you know, everybody's not for this thing.

07:46.652 --> 07:49.316
And so there were some surprises there.

07:50.177 --> 07:54.663
But Korea certainly shaded our thinking.

07:55.665 --> 07:58.108
And I saw people drafted out of A&M.

07:58.128 --> 08:06.861
If you weren't in the Corps and you weren't making decent grades, two of my friends were drafted right out of school here for the Korean War.

08:07.162 --> 08:10.806
later came back and got their degrees in engineering, but they were drafted.

08:12.889 --> 08:19.277
My older brother, I mentioned, we came here together, and he would have been a junior, and he was in the Corps for a while.

08:20.418 --> 08:27.367
And he'd had some asthma problems growing up, being around wheat and chaff and stuff.

08:27.387 --> 08:28.768
Sometimes it would just choke him up.

08:29.790 --> 08:31.391
And he got drafted.

08:32.233 --> 08:35.937
He was ordered to Abilene, to the induction board,

08:36.862 --> 08:39.566
Well, I better back up first.

08:39.626 --> 08:47.536
He lost his contract within the first six weeks here at A&M because they looked at his medical record and found that he had all this asthma stuff.

08:48.678 --> 08:51.902
And they said, sorry, you know, we can't give you a contract.

08:52.423 --> 08:53.665
And, you know, broke his heart.

08:54.025 --> 08:59.913
He'd been the Corps commander up in Tarleton when he was up there, you know, in his top year at Tarleton.

09:00.514 --> 09:02.076
He was big time in this.

09:02.663 --> 09:07.430
you know, he was just looking forward to being in the Corps here, but they bounced him out of the Corps.

09:08.291 --> 09:09.473
And so he was a civilian.

09:09.573 --> 09:11.696
Well, it wasn't too long.

09:11.796 --> 09:26.558
I don't remember exactly the timing, but he was ordered for induction, and he went to Abilene, and he was on the bus to leave there, and they come on board and say, is there a Jim Darling around here?

09:26.598 --> 09:27.540
Yeah, come here.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.544
They called him back inside, and they said, say, we just

09:31.402 --> 09:34.657
Looked at some other things here, and we think you're 4F.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.425
We're not going to take you.

09:36.887 --> 09:37.429
Go home.

09:38.017 --> 09:41.423
Well, he'd already dropped out A&M, so he turned around and come back to A&M.

09:41.503 --> 09:43.466
So he finishes as a civilian student.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.371
But that says something about what was happening to people.

09:47.473 --> 09:54.205
And, you know, I knew that when I finished A&M, I owed the military something.

09:54.305 --> 09:55.126
I wanted to serve.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.869
I didn't have any qualms about that.

09:56.889 --> 09:58.472
I wanted to serve.

09:59.053 --> 10:02.539
And it seemed like the natural and normal thing to do.

10:02.519 --> 10:15.600
But I was going to be a citizen soldier, meaning I do my thing and then I was going to be back to teach school or be a county agent or maybe coach or something like that.

10:16.255 --> 10:28.409
So, you know, I was prepared for all that and, you know, but I stayed in school, ROTC, and they didn't take me because I was in ROTC and, I mean, I didn't get drafted or anything.

10:28.429 --> 10:43.967
I don't know about any corps that was in good standing that got drafted, but if you, and we had a lot of civilian students here then, a good many, a lot of them are still World War II folks, but a good many folks did get drafted out of school and went to the war, but I,

10:44.656 --> 10:52.366
Korean did end just before I graduated, and then they suddenly want to demobilize, and they don't want all these people in the Air Force.

10:52.386 --> 10:57.713
In fact, a lot of my classmates did not get commissioned on graduation at A&M.

10:58.894 --> 11:11.490
Air Force, because the Air Force had a big cutback coming, and they said, we don't need all these guys, so unless you're going to be a technical guy or you're going to be a pilot, we don't want you, and we're going to

11:12.179 --> 11:13.320
We're not going to commission you.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.102
We're going to give you four stripes.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.985
And you come in the Air Force as a four striper.

11:18.385 --> 11:25.352
And a good many of my friends that were not engineers and were not pilot qualified did end up in the Air Force's enlisted people.

11:25.992 --> 11:29.996
Later, the Air Force did relent on that and did commission all these people.

11:31.117 --> 11:38.845
But that was a pretty raw deal, I thought, for a lot of my friends that didn't qualify or didn't want to fly.

11:39.854 --> 11:44.961
During that freshman year, talk about some of the campus personalities.

11:44.981 --> 11:46.884
The president at A&M at that point?

11:47.284 --> 11:48.005
David Morgan.

11:48.186 --> 11:48.987
David Morgan.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.110
And then Dr. Harrington.

11:51.130 --> 11:53.533
So Morgan was new by the time you got here.

11:53.874 --> 11:55.356
Did you see him?

11:56.117 --> 11:57.258
I remember seeing him.

11:57.739 --> 12:00.803
You know, I knew he was president and all of that, but I didn't have any.

12:01.204 --> 12:03.567
You all didn't have any impression of him?

12:03.547 --> 12:05.811
what he was like or anything, I presume?

12:06.112 --> 12:07.955
You know, he was a pretty impressive man.

12:08.016 --> 12:09.238
I thought he was nice, handsome.

12:09.318 --> 12:10.721
He looked like a president to me.

12:11.282 --> 12:17.353
And, you know, what I observed, an 18-year-old kid, pretty naive, I was pretty impressed with him.

12:17.373 --> 12:19.277
Now, I've read a lot of stuff.

12:19.392 --> 12:21.136
since then as Commandant.

12:21.156 --> 12:26.829
I know he did a big study there that was pretty condemning of the Corps.

12:26.849 --> 12:34.347
Like, you know, there's got to be some changes and there's some pretty extensive stuff that he was involved in there toward the

12:35.440 --> 12:40.167
latter part of the time I was here, but you know, I really didn't know anything about that at the time.

12:40.187 --> 12:44.954
You know, as an innocent kid down there in the Corps, you don't know all those things.

12:44.974 --> 12:48.298
Who was the Dean of Agriculture?

12:49.039 --> 12:50.521
Oh, let's see, I can picture him.

12:50.541 --> 12:53.426
A gray-haired fella, been here a long time.

12:54.627 --> 12:56.870
Famous name in agriculture in Texas.

12:56.991 --> 12:57.772
Warden Patterson?

12:58.072 --> 12:58.292
No.

12:59.815 --> 12:59.915
Okay.

12:59.935 --> 13:00.876
Who was the Commandant?

13:00.936 --> 13:02.358
Dean EJ, let's see, you know.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.042
Well, the Commandant,

13:05.832 --> 13:08.135
was General Boatner, Colonel Boatner.

13:08.615 --> 13:11.098
Make believe I'd never heard of him before.

13:11.739 --> 13:13.561
That's a good question.

13:13.701 --> 13:15.604
Describe his personality.

13:15.624 --> 13:17.406
What he seemed like to you students.

13:17.426 --> 13:18.667
Well, I was scared to death of him.

13:19.428 --> 13:23.833
I never met a man, I never saw a man that I was more afraid of than Colonel Boatner.

13:25.195 --> 13:31.703
And, you know, cadets had had these run-ins with him on campus and other places, and I heard all these stories.

13:31.843 --> 13:33.645
What a mean, ruthless,

13:34.334 --> 14:00.105
guy you never want to encounter him and i remember one of the first things they teach us was taught us was how to salute and who to salute and all this sort of thing and and i was a little afraid to meet an officer that i'd have to salute that i might not do it just right so you know i kind of kept my eye out but one man i always tried to be on the alert for to be a block away was colonel boatner

14:01.182 --> 14:05.409
Because I didn't want to encounter his wrath because I didn't salute riot or whatever.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.193
I thought, you know, now say he'd do that, I don't know.

14:09.315 --> 14:13.061
But that just kind of expresses my fear of him.

14:13.081 --> 14:14.564
Physically, what was he like?

14:14.584 --> 14:18.090
Well, I remember him as being a pretty well-built fellow.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.435
I don't know that he was tall, but, you know, he seemed...

14:22.428 --> 14:29.820
The picture I have of him is a fairly stocky man, but, you know, a pretty square jaw and full face and all that.

14:29.880 --> 14:34.107
And I just remember him as being a tough man.

14:34.287 --> 14:42.800
And, you know, a lot of it was probably spread by rumors that other students talk about, say, and, you know, it carries around and people.

14:43.401 --> 14:50.072
But, you know, I've met a lot of other friends that have a similar view of Colonel Boatner, but he was our commandant my first year.

14:50.710 --> 14:58.003
And then he goes to Korea before you graduate or after?

14:58.343 --> 15:02.811
Oh, he goes to, he leaves after I think his one year or something like that after I'm here.

15:02.851 --> 15:12.228
But Korean War is heated up and they need this tough guy over there and he goes over there and straights out the POW, the prisoner thing and, you know, makes national news.

15:12.388 --> 15:15.233
What did you and your buddies think when you read that story?

15:15.668 --> 15:16.489
Yep, that's him.

15:17.551 --> 15:18.032
That's him.

15:18.913 --> 15:20.996
He's a guy who can do that sort of thing.

15:21.036 --> 15:21.997
Who succeeded him?

15:28.287 --> 15:34.256
Well, it was Colonel Davis, I believe.

15:35.417 --> 15:36.178
Colonel Joe Davis.

15:38.462 --> 15:42.067
When I got here, he was nicknamed Fighting Joe.

15:42.468 --> 15:43.309
Colonel Joe Davis.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.372
Describe him.

15:45.588 --> 15:49.452
Well, you know, I didn't have much dealings with him either.

15:49.552 --> 15:52.134
I didn't, was never in his office.

15:56.098 --> 16:01.884
But I, you know, thought he was, again, a role model.

16:03.305 --> 16:08.350
I held him in high esteem from what I knew of him.

16:08.370 --> 16:09.932
I thought he was pretty good.

16:09.992 --> 16:11.173
I didn't have any

16:12.318 --> 16:20.090
Any doubts about him, I'd give him very positive marks from what I knew and what I saw, which was very limited.

16:21.132 --> 16:34.393
However, I know he stayed here a long time and retired, and I remember after I came here, I wondered what happened to Colonel Joe Davis, and Buck Henderson told me he's living up in Stephenville, and I wrote him a letter.

16:35.403 --> 16:39.889
And I got a very nice letter back from him, and we had a little thing going there for a while.

16:40.990 --> 16:44.635
And the commandant's officers were in the Trigon then?

16:46.838 --> 16:49.942
I assume they were, but I never was in the Trigon.

16:50.663 --> 16:55.129
And at that point, you weren't dreaming of a military career at all?

16:55.169 --> 16:56.712
Not at all, not a military career.

16:56.812 --> 17:00.837
Serving, yes, but never a career.

17:01.154 --> 17:07.553
The ROTC had all those old World War II barracks and all down there kind of lined up in a row.

17:07.673 --> 17:12.126
It was kind of a terrible looking area, but all our classes and everything were down there.

17:12.562 --> 17:23.137
There was one Air Force officer that I remember very well, was a guy that I had a class under him here, a time or two, a major, Hubb Johnson.

17:23.517 --> 17:26.201
He's an Aggie class of 41, I believe it is.

17:26.782 --> 17:27.523
Hubb Johnson.

17:28.424 --> 17:30.226
He was a non-rated officer, not a flyer.

17:30.947 --> 17:39.619
But he taught Air Force ROTC, and I had a class or two under him, and I thought very highly of him.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.383
Now, you were Air Force.

17:42.683 --> 17:46.268
And by then, the Air Force was a separate branch.

17:46.448 --> 17:46.749
Yes.

17:46.789 --> 17:48.130
So it wasn't Army Air Corps.

17:48.150 --> 17:48.451
No.

17:48.671 --> 17:49.993
It was Air Force.

17:50.253 --> 17:54.419
I'll come back to Hub Johnson in a moment, but I need to mention this one little story.

17:55.200 --> 18:02.831
I said when I came to A&M, you know, I knew his military was going to wear an A&M uniform, and I thought that was all going to be pretty jazzy.

18:02.911 --> 18:03.832
I liked that idea.

18:04.613 --> 18:07.837
And I never thought about separate services here.

18:07.857 --> 18:09.600
I just assumed it's Army.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.222
I didn't know the difference.

18:11.843 --> 18:23.458
And that first week I was here when we were doing that M processing and all the registering and all that, and I went through this one line that they were determining which ROTC you were going to be in.

18:24.679 --> 18:27.323
And I don't even know what line I'm in.

18:27.403 --> 18:28.404
I'm just in this line.

18:28.424 --> 18:29.686
They tell us to get in this line.

18:29.706 --> 18:30.607
We're going through here.

18:31.087 --> 18:38.577
And I get up there and some guy in a uniform looks up at me and he says, son, you want Air Force or Army?

18:39.569 --> 18:41.332
You know, I never knew I had a choice.

18:43.314 --> 18:48.402
And I've told this story a few times that in 10 seconds it kind of rolled through my mind.

18:48.442 --> 18:50.725
Air Force, airplanes, all that.

18:52.467 --> 18:54.690
You know, crawling on your belly and doing that stuff.

18:54.710 --> 18:55.632
I'll take Air Force.

18:55.652 --> 18:57.915
In 10 seconds I told him

18:58.132 --> 19:01.956
I would take Air Force, and it shaped the whole rest of my life.

19:03.418 --> 19:05.881
There are decisions like that that you make sometimes.

19:06.041 --> 19:18.034
It was not a well thought out decision, but I just, in 10 or 15 seconds, kind of had a mental vision of what the Air Force was, and I really didn't know that much.

19:18.114 --> 19:20.737
I'd had one airplane ride in my life to that point.

19:21.158 --> 19:24.842
Did you go back to the dorm that night and rethink it?

19:25.282 --> 19:26.063
No.

19:26.296 --> 19:27.798
Never, never questioned it.

19:28.259 --> 19:30.042
And I don't question it until today.

19:30.442 --> 19:36.271
But it was, again, one of those things that totally surprised me.

19:36.411 --> 19:40.097
Again, I didn't even know we had Air Force ROTC.

19:40.558 --> 19:44.944
I remember the Army Air Corps, but the Air Force became a separate service in 1947.

19:45.065 --> 19:50.112
So, you know, this was 1950, so it's still a new thing.

19:50.132 --> 19:52.075
But the Air Force was quite popular.

19:52.937 --> 19:55.240
A lot of folks did get into it.

19:55.642 --> 20:04.504
But we did have a little problem with commissioning in that because of the downsizing, a lot of them had to go in as four-stripers.

20:04.838 --> 20:12.245
Two of the celebrity people that I always ask about, one is Mr. Cashin.

20:12.505 --> 20:13.526
Was he still around?

20:13.546 --> 20:13.826
Yes.

20:14.327 --> 20:16.149
Describe him if you had any.

20:16.169 --> 20:19.372
Well, you know, I can't remember too much.

20:19.472 --> 20:26.478
I just remember that name and the Cashin, Jimmy Cashin had played football in the late 40s.

20:26.578 --> 20:34.186
I used to see when I was growing up, still in high school, I would tune in that old radio to the A&M football game.

20:34.206 --> 20:34.626
Sure.

20:35.180 --> 20:39.247
And I could tell you all the players that played for A&M in those years.

20:39.487 --> 20:41.471
Cash and Name was one that stuck with me.

20:42.833 --> 20:48.182
But I remember the core, those yells in the background and old Kern Tips announcing these games.

20:48.523 --> 20:51.568
There's never been anything like it since then, in my opinion.

20:51.548 --> 20:54.315
A guy could really describe those things.

20:54.756 --> 20:56.199
Got a good middle picture of you.

20:56.219 --> 20:56.540
Oh, good.

20:56.841 --> 21:03.577
But I could hear all of that, and I knew the Aggie football names, and I followed recruiting and all that, or who they signed up.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.604
But Cashin name was one that I knew, and then

21:06.584 --> 21:09.909
Red Cashin, I believe, is class of 53, if I remember.

21:10.069 --> 21:10.710
I remember him.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.873
He was over in the athletic dorm.

21:12.893 --> 21:14.275
I say he's in the athletic dorm.

21:14.295 --> 21:15.758
He was connected with athletics.

21:15.798 --> 21:17.240
He may have been living locally then.

21:17.300 --> 21:17.961
I don't know.

21:19.243 --> 21:19.663
I don't know.

21:19.723 --> 21:21.106
But it seemed like he was in the dorm.

21:21.126 --> 21:23.249
But I saw Red around, and, you know, we visited.

21:23.890 --> 21:30.700
But, you know, that's about— Red was a friendly guy back then.

21:30.740 --> 21:33.304
I just— What about Colonel Indy?

21:33.324 --> 21:33.524
Who?

21:33.624 --> 21:34.245
Colonel Indy?

21:34.647 --> 21:35.429
Andy Anderson?

21:35.569 --> 21:37.594
Oh, Andy Anderson, yes, I remember him.

21:37.614 --> 21:41.985
A very respected man, a very distinguished, gray-haired fellow.

21:43.107 --> 21:45.092
Looks kinda like you, I think.

21:45.112 --> 21:46.716
Or you look like him.

21:47.084 --> 22:12.619
uh you know i heard lots of good things about colonel anderson i want to mention that hub johnson the major that i before i forget that if i may please uh you asked me about role models or military instructor and so forth but hub johnson was a fellow that i took some rtc classes on but he left here and he went back to the air force and did his thing and he made brigadier general

22:12.599 --> 22:16.904
And he ended up over here in the Air Force Village in San Antonio.

22:16.924 --> 22:25.115
When I came back to A&M in 87, he came over to A&M and visited because it was the Corps Center one year after we got that built.

22:25.796 --> 22:28.679
And I had such a good reunion with Hub Johnson.

22:29.420 --> 22:35.568
And I told him, you know, how he had helped shape my future in life and how I respected him.

22:35.648 --> 22:38.151
And he had a very distinguished career.

22:38.654 --> 22:42.619
But unfortunately, he died a couple years ago over there in Air Force Village.

22:42.659 --> 22:45.042
But, you know, he was an Aggie.

22:45.963 --> 22:49.488
And a lot of those instructors were not A&M people then.

22:50.209 --> 22:53.814
But, you know, those are the names that I remember from ROTC.

22:54.174 --> 22:58.219
As you go home at the end of that first year, you've made good grades.

22:59.962 --> 23:03.867
How did you feel for that, at the end of that first year, going home for the summer?

23:04.147 --> 23:04.848
I felt great.

23:05.909 --> 23:07.311
I felt on top of the world.

23:07.797 --> 23:34.058
and did you feel like you were headed in the direction that you'd hoped to go you had i felt very good about only thing a little unsettled where i'm going to play basketball or more or i need to get totally serious about school and i wanted to get involved in some other thing the basketball just ate all my time those practices were long and grueling and i gather the coach was not that warm

23:34.358 --> 23:56.535
well you know i'm not saying he's not a good man it was just his philosophy and style and you know it's what he learned under hank iba and i remember one thing that had a rule no drinking of water during practice we'd go a whole practice without getting a drink of water and you know our mouths would just be cotton

23:57.511 --> 23:59.813
Nowadays, they encourage you to drink water.

23:59.993 --> 24:06.279
But, you know, a lot of us had played ball, and when we get together, we thought, man, you know, can you ever think that we couldn't get a drink of water?

24:06.960 --> 24:08.701
You know, he wouldn't let us shoot a hook shot.

24:08.921 --> 24:12.765
Every free throw had to be underhanded, on and on and on.

24:13.546 --> 24:18.150
But, you know, he was a good man, but, again, we didn't appreciate his style.

24:18.170 --> 24:24.696
We'd go see these other teams play, and they were doing all this new stuff and fancy stuff and, you know, not us.

24:24.956 --> 24:25.797
Had you had some

24:26.080 --> 24:31.167
some teachers already that also had an important role model effect on you?

24:34.952 --> 24:35.853
End of the first year.

24:35.873 --> 24:43.944
I had an agronomy professor, Mogford, somewhere in there.

24:44.105 --> 24:47.890
I believe it was maybe the first or second year, but they called him Cotton Joe Mogford.

24:47.950 --> 24:49.272
He was around here a long time.

24:49.292 --> 24:50.974
You know, we respected him.

24:51.410 --> 24:52.632
Oh, very much of him.

24:52.812 --> 24:55.396
Now, almost everybody had a nickname then, didn't they?

24:55.416 --> 24:56.117
Well, that's true.

24:56.177 --> 24:56.938
A lot of them did.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.181
Including students.

24:59.201 --> 25:00.063
Did you have a nickname?

25:10.137 --> 25:12.000
There were few people that...

25:12.571 --> 25:13.132
knew me.

25:13.152 --> 25:15.314
In some way, they'd linked it with my last name.

25:15.334 --> 25:16.475
They called me Sweetheart.

25:16.575 --> 25:17.155
Some of them did.

25:17.175 --> 25:18.016
Sweetheart Darling?

25:18.176 --> 25:19.818
Yeah, because they thought, you know, this is funny.

25:19.958 --> 25:31.689
All the way from first grade on up, when I go to school, you know, the teacher calls a roll, and especially in the lower grades, even the high school, you know, people kind of look around and kind of snicker.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.051
Something about the name.

25:34.111 --> 25:42.139
They think it's a strange name, but in high school, some of my buddies sort of linked that together, and some of them that came on to A&M sort of

25:42.727 --> 25:59.443
And there's a couple of guys if I meet today, that's probably what they'd call me, but you know, across the rank and file they didn't do that, but that's one name that... Now these nicknames particularly that students gave to faculty, those were not put downs, they were, were they?

25:59.763 --> 26:00.884
No, I don't think so.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.567
They were kind of terms of endearment, weren't they?

26:03.687 --> 26:04.307
Acceptance?

26:04.828 --> 26:09.392
I never thought of them as negative, in a negative way.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.876
You know, there was a sociology professor.

26:11.916 --> 26:14.761
I never had him, but I've heard a lot of people talk about it.

26:14.781 --> 26:17.745
You probably know who I'm talking about, but I can't call the name right now.

26:17.765 --> 26:19.788
Dr. Dan, the grade point man.

26:20.169 --> 26:20.269
Yeah.

26:20.389 --> 26:21.010
Dan Russell.

26:21.651 --> 26:22.232
Dan Russell.

26:22.713 --> 26:23.514
Now, I remember him.

26:24.515 --> 26:25.276
He was a good man.

26:25.397 --> 26:26.438
Did you ever question him?

26:27.760 --> 26:28.641
I don't believe I did.

26:28.702 --> 26:32.748
I don't believe I had him, but some of my classmates had him, and I remember him.

26:32.768 --> 26:35.251
He was kind of a prominent person here at the time.

26:35.271 --> 26:37.675
See, among his very, very, very important

26:38.026 --> 26:41.170
contributions, he's the one that thought up the project houses.

26:41.890 --> 26:46.736
That was his idea for those poor boys during the Depression.

26:46.756 --> 26:47.457
All right, you go home.

26:47.517 --> 26:49.079
What did you do that summer?

26:49.099 --> 26:57.148
Well, I go to work immediately, working in the grain harvest, driving a tractor, pulling a combine.

26:57.168 --> 26:58.229
Did y'all go on the road?

26:58.269 --> 27:02.734
No, we mostly worked in the area there.

27:03.524 --> 27:08.471
And we'd work up until probably July and we got all the grain cut.

27:08.891 --> 27:11.214
And then we started breaking all the stubble land.

27:12.236 --> 27:17.162
So, you know, it went right on until last day to head back to school.

27:17.182 --> 27:19.806
But that's what I did those years.

27:19.826 --> 27:28.097
Now, summer of 53, I went to ROTC summer camp.

27:28.735 --> 27:36.265
But before I went out there, that was a year that the great drought sort of hit out there and there was no wheat, no grain to combine that year.

27:36.685 --> 27:37.827
I mean, it was nothing.

27:38.628 --> 27:40.971
And I thought, what am I going to do for a job?

27:42.713 --> 27:49.102
And I couldn't find any place that seemed to need anybody because agriculture was zero that year.

27:49.382 --> 27:51.565
It had great dust storms and all of that.

27:52.647 --> 27:58.354
And I remember contacting somebody at the Abilene A&M Club, one of my friends.

27:59.313 --> 28:02.017
And they said, Tom, we'll help you get a job.

28:02.858 --> 28:05.081
And that's one thing that really impressed me.

28:05.382 --> 28:07.064
Boy, these Aggies stick together.

28:07.385 --> 28:10.770
You know, I knew they tried to help each other and all that.

28:10.810 --> 28:13.053
I'd learned all that and heard stories about it.

28:13.073 --> 28:15.757
But this was my first real visible example of that.

28:15.857 --> 28:19.262
I needed a job in the worst way.

28:19.748 --> 28:24.112
They did get me a job at the Central Texas Machinery Company there in Abilene.

28:25.193 --> 28:39.425
It's a caterpillar dealer, and these old caterpillars, when these tracks, the bushings and pins wear out, and you can turn them over 180 degrees, and you can get another life out of them.

28:39.445 --> 28:41.547
You push them out through this press and all that.

28:41.567 --> 28:48.793
It's kind of a dangerous job pushing these things out of there, but anyway, I worked there the time that I had available.

28:49.297 --> 28:53.280
There was an Aggie connected with that that helped get me in there.

28:53.721 --> 28:57.344
So you come back for your sophomore year with a little more money in your pocket.

28:57.784 --> 28:59.586
Well, enough to run me for a while.

29:00.247 --> 29:04.850
And you felt confident that now you were headed in the right direction.

29:05.951 --> 29:10.696
Anything different occur your sophomore year?

29:10.756 --> 29:11.676
Anything change?

29:13.058 --> 29:18.122
Well, you know, I'm a sophomore now, and, you know, I've got...

29:19.098 --> 29:20.179
some right.

29:20.299 --> 29:21.460
You're still in Hart Hall though.

29:21.900 --> 29:23.322
Initially, yes.

29:27.245 --> 29:35.352
But I said to myself as a freshman, if I ever get to be a sophomore or junior, I'm not going to be like some of these guys.

29:35.372 --> 29:37.134
I don't think that's the right approach.

29:37.734 --> 29:43.839
Some of them were just ruthless and crude and unreasonable, I thought.

29:45.261 --> 29:47.923
And

29:48.562 --> 29:51.566
I didn't believe in abusing people.

29:51.806 --> 29:55.030
Had you had a paddle used on you as a freshman?

29:55.050 --> 29:55.891
No.

29:55.911 --> 29:56.191
Really?

29:56.932 --> 29:58.514
Well, I had a broom.

29:58.894 --> 29:59.155
Okay.

29:59.876 --> 30:04.461
I've been hit with a broom, but I wouldn't call it serious or anything.

30:04.621 --> 30:10.228
But, you know, I didn't see much of that stuff.

30:12.471 --> 30:17.657
I heard sophomores ahead of me talking about, man, they put a notch on their...

30:18.177 --> 30:20.220
desk chair for every lick they had.

30:21.322 --> 30:23.806
You know, they had all these licks and all this stuff.

30:24.767 --> 30:29.995
I frankly didn't see much of that firsthand.

30:30.676 --> 30:41.974
But, you know, once in a while they'd hit you with a broom or something, but it was not the cruel and vicious kind that you hear stories about, but I didn't see that.

30:42.427 --> 30:47.093
As a sophomore in the dining hall, life was a little less interrupted.

30:47.774 --> 30:47.854
Yes.

30:47.875 --> 30:50.498
And I was, that was, it was pleasant.

30:50.518 --> 30:54.644
You know, I enjoyed being able to walk across campus without being harassed.

30:56.186 --> 30:58.089
That, I really looked forward to that.

30:58.830 --> 31:02.355
And I thought that was, that was one of the great opportunities.

31:02.655 --> 31:07.602
Describe, now for the whole four years, describe the A&M student body in general.

31:08.042 --> 31:09.244
Where were they from?

31:09.730 --> 31:13.980
What were their attitudes, values, rich, poor?

31:14.822 --> 31:22.781
Well, it seems like in those days, you know, I can't put a number on it, but there were a lot of students.

31:22.841 --> 31:24.685
I'd say, you know, maybe half.
