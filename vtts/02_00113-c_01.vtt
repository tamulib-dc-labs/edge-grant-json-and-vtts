WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:08.509
Should the dean be bound by the majority vote of the 
department heads? Oh, no. No. It's the same type

00:10.912 --> 00:12.233
thing. You don't want a weak dean. In fact, I'd say 
that with Pages. You want a dean that will not only

00:18.881 --> 00:24.868
stand up to his department heads, but stand up to 
the upper administration. And I think anybody

00:25.709 --> 00:30.915
like that has got to be willing to step down any 
time.

00:36.059 --> 00:42.708
I mean, there are some things that are worth that. 
Looking back now over half century almost, well,

00:42.989 --> 00:56.988
half century, can you think of some opportunities 
that we at A&M in engineering that we missed, we

00:42.989 --> 00:56.988
passed by? Well, there's a couple. One of the 
things I wanted to do and I couldn't get Prescott to

01:03.987 --> 01:06.649
help support it.

01:09.852 --> 01:11.974
I believe he was up there then. There's a polymer 
group, and we should be strong in polymers at Texas

01:12.034 --> 01:23.824
A&M because this whole Gulf Coast is in the 
business of making polymers. I don't care how many

01:23.844 --> 01:33.893
Nobel people type you got, we need some people 
working on the chemistry that's going on in Texas.

01:34.278 --> 01:36.801
And I don't think we've got very much of that going 
on. So we need, that's one of the things that we

01:36.881 --> 01:41.346
still need. That's still an opportunity. But the 
whole group wanted to move down here. From where?

01:48.414 --> 01:49.235
Massachusetts. The University of 
Massachusetts, I recall. And we had it all lined

01:53.821 --> 01:58.987
up, Benson and I, and we couldn't get support for 
it. Another one I think the university missed,

02:02.662 --> 02:05.050
They're always trying to bring people into this 
system. One of the schools that they didn't bring

02:05.251 --> 02:08.120
in, they should have been on the ball. And I told 
Thompson so. I think it was too late. was Lamar

02:12.618 --> 02:14.020
Tech. Lamar Tech is an engineering school like 
A&M, a good location on the coast, and is a school

02:14.040 --> 02:23.291
that fits with A&M better. It got into this, I told 
him that even though it's in the other bunch, it

02:23.792 --> 02:28.097
doesn't have to stay in there. The people in Lamar 
Tech would much prefer to be in our system than in

02:28.157 --> 02:35.065
theirs because there's more to be gained. We've 
got a lot of synergisms that you don't have with a

02:35.126 --> 02:39.331
bunch of teachers' schools. They got in with Sam 
Houston and some others. But there's one

02:42.132 --> 02:49.842
opportunity that we've missed there, and they've 
gotten in a lot of others that I don't know whether

02:42.132 --> 02:49.842
there were opportunities or not. They may go the 
other way, but that's one that ought to be pursued

02:52.045 --> 02:55.890
now. Did we miss on any scholars that you can think 
of, any faculty that we might have gotten?

03:06.344 --> 03:08.427
Oh, I don't know that we did. I'm not sure that we- 
You can't think of anybody- We might have offered

03:10.499 --> 03:15.805
the one or two that we didn't get. But you can't 
think of any that became- I can't think of any that

03:16.285 --> 03:20.170
would have- Really great. Would have made the 
difference. Okay. One of the things that I think,

03:22.913 --> 03:34.566
another thing that I think is a real issue is that 
universities want to buy They're standing. They

03:36.784 --> 03:38.949
go around hiring everybody else's people. I think 
a real credit to the university is did we grow

03:39.470 --> 03:44.360
people? And I think that there's no mark ever given 
for how many people did you grow on your faculty

03:44.380 --> 03:55.103
bringing them up from assistant professor to 
where they became people of stature. And that

03:55.184 --> 04:01.734
really should be the mark of a university, is did 
you grow them yourself, or did you just put the

03:55.184 --> 04:01.734
money out and get them? Anybody can buy anything if 
they got the money. Who's the old boy that's got

04:06.522 --> 04:07.964
CNN? He can buy it. Yeah, yeah. But I think there's 
not enough credit given, and I don't ever hear that

04:10.508 --> 04:18.201
mentioned, is did you develop these people? Now, 
in a company, that's a real mark. They don't go and

04:22.808 --> 04:26.956
get their people from somebody else. Did you ever 
have or do you now have any Department of Chemical

04:27.297 --> 04:39.180
Engineering elsewhere after whom you wanted us to 
be modeled? No, I think that we really ought to be, I

04:40.190 --> 04:45.322
don't think we ought to be looking at somebody 
else. That's the trouble. What we ought to do is

04:47.066 --> 04:58.553
look at the state of Texas, the industry that we 
have, and then model ourselves to serve the people

04:47.066 --> 04:58.553
that we are set up to serve. And I think trying to be 
like somebody else, unless they've got the same

04:59.562 --> 05:11.978
situation we are, we are unique, we've got the A&M 
in the name, and we ought to go ahead and pull

04:59.562 --> 05:11.978
through on these other things. Yeah, like your... 
alma mater at NC State, they are very good in

05:13.467 --> 05:18.616
textile. Yeah, well that was a whole area. That 
fits with that state. It fits with the state. And we

05:24.486 --> 05:27.230
here are downgrading agriculture some. I was 
talking to one of the people in agriculture, and I

05:27.270 --> 05:33.681
think his old Harry was wanting to say, well, you 
don't need all this. One guy said, well, hell, I

05:34.182 --> 05:37.908
guess you get one cow and one hog and teach 
agriculture. But I think agriculture is a big

05:39.607 --> 05:44.435
thing and it still is a big thing in the state and 
will continue to be. It may be a different type of

05:44.475 --> 05:46.218
agriculture. It may be very intensive type, but 
you've got all the different type industries that

05:46.258 --> 05:55.995
we've got here and we need to be We've got the 
electronic industry and so on, but we've also got

05:56.060 --> 06:00.549
the big chemical industry. And we'll still, this 
chemical industry is not going away. In fact, I'm

06:04.276 --> 06:16.701
writing an article right here now, a study that we 
did, and I'm saying that actually the 20th and 21st

06:04.276 --> 06:16.701
century should be called the chemical age because 
you can't look anywhere and see any material that

06:16.681 --> 06:20.347
was in some way touched by the chemical industry. 
You might say, well, the information agent, all of

06:20.768 --> 06:23.112
this. Well, actually, that's just come from a 
calculator. It's made out of chips, which is a

06:25.696 --> 06:27.840
chemical product. So all of those are really 
subsets of the chemical. What we've really done is

06:30.825 --> 06:39.600
bring on all these new materials that have made 
life a lot better and have made possible all these

06:30.825 --> 06:39.600
other things. and they look like they're the thing 
that's driving it and they do have an upper hand

06:40.576 --> 07:09.469
right now but you've got to have all these things 
and people are not going to do without them and

06:40.576 --> 07:09.469
they're still going to be coming more and more of 
them and what's happening is that the life

06:40.576 --> 07:09.469
sciences is really they're recognizing that 
they're just chemistry and as they learn the

06:40.576 --> 07:09.469
chemistry and cancer and all of this they're going 
to be able to better understand and treat all these

06:40.576 --> 07:09.469
things as well as produce better foods. So some of 
these companies are separating themselves in the

07:11.234 --> 07:20.663
life sciences and chemicals, and I think that's a 
mistake because one of these days they're going to

07:11.234 --> 07:20.663
need a life. What they might refer to as a 
biological process, but all they're doing is

07:21.684 --> 07:30.453
carrying out a chemical reaction right next to 
another one that they regard as a chemical

07:21.684 --> 07:30.453
reaction. So I think that's the direction that 
we're going to go in. They'll come back together.

07:34.797 --> 07:37.920
Right now they're going apart, but they'll come 
back together. And so I see the chemical as being a

07:38.238 --> 07:44.544
big thing from now on. Am I correct that you appear 
to be defining chemical engineering as applied

07:45.165 --> 07:50.690
chemistry? Chemistry in the real world that 
serves a purpose. Let's see, as you went out to

07:56.456 --> 08:07.907
either search for funding for chemical 
engineering research or to...

08:09.862 --> 08:13.630
work more closely with some of our alumni and so 
forth. Do you have any stories of uh... that uh...

08:13.650 --> 08:24.873
of the real world of how those people felt about A&M 
and about the chemical engineering here?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.102
Oh uh... I'm not, it's been a long time since I've, I 
did go with them the other day though, and old

08:29.453 --> 08:54.398
Charles Herter, just a surprising thing, I taught 
him, and it's a good thing I continued to teach

08:29.453 --> 08:54.398
because he graduated around 72, and the old Les 
Appelt, he is now the president and chief

08:29.453 --> 08:54.398
executive officer of that company, and he was a 
chemical engineer, and the reason he's done so

08:29.453 --> 08:54.398
well is that he can judge. commercial projects. 
And so he's at the very top of it. And I went with old

08:58.941 --> 09:01.964
Jettikee and them down there to hunt some money. 
And I hadn't really had much to do with him since he

09:03.185 --> 09:09.270
graduated. I'd met him once other time. And when 
Jettikee called up, he said, be sure and bring Dr.

09:11.772 --> 09:16.336
Holland with you. And we got down there, and he 
said, oh, he just welcomed with Omar. And he said,

09:20.600 --> 09:25.144
can I give you a hug?

09:25.580 --> 09:45.225
And I was sure glad that even though I could have 
just sat on my butt and not taught anything as the

09:25.580 --> 09:45.225
apartment head, I continued to teach because 
those are the kind of relationships that you don't

09:25.580 --> 09:45.225
realize how many of them are out there until you get 
out talking to people because they're scattered

09:25.580 --> 09:45.225
all over. Let's see, did you ever have... You know, 
I talked with this old boy that wasn't even one of

09:45.863 --> 09:50.829
our students. The boy, the guy that owned 
Petrotex, that bought it and just made millions of

09:50.849 --> 10:01.381
dollars because he was the first one that had MTBE 
available. And I went down to speak to his

10:02.623 --> 10:07.649
employees on cancer. And he'd take a graduate 
extension course from me in about 1955, 1956 down

10:08.670 --> 10:14.537
at Dow. And he told me that when he saw that I was 
going to give the talk, he said, I don't think that

10:15.530 --> 10:27.302
could be the same Dr. Holland that I knew and taught 
me that course. But now he's an old man. Well, he

10:31.826 --> 10:38.433
said that at that time he was about 20, 21, and I was 
about 30. And he thought that that looked awfully

10:38.573 --> 10:44.018
old to him then, 30 years old. But you run across, 
I've run across a lot of people that I've taught in

10:44.183 --> 10:50.090
graduate extension courses. So I think, 
actually, well, you go back to the Bible. What was

10:53.894 --> 10:55.416
the teacher? And this is what people don't think 
about, that teaching probably is the most

10:56.738 --> 11:05.969
honorable of all professions and the most 
important. And it's the way to have the most

11:05.989 --> 11:09.072
influence. Did you ever have... in your years as a 
faculty member and or department head, did you

11:12.314 --> 11:25.129
ever have a legislator or a regent attempt to 
intervene and twist your arm? No, the closest I

11:25.630 --> 11:32.778
came was this little boy that gave the money for the 
business administration bill. What was his name?

11:33.539 --> 11:34.660
John Blocker. In the early 70s, we were having this 
energy scare. And so I'd set up this energy

11:40.854 --> 11:42.837
symposium. And I'd been down in Mexico, and I'd 
visited the old boy. De La Pena, he was in charge of

11:47.385 --> 11:53.476
all purchasing for PMAX. In the last four years is 
where you rake in the money. You slip some out of all

11:56.802 --> 11:59.888
of it. Let's see, I can't forget, remember the 
other guy's name. He was in the University of

12:04.975 --> 12:06.118
Texas. He was in charge of all production. And so 
when Blocker, for some reason he heard about it. So

12:15.460 --> 12:22.769
he sent his plane down to the King, they stopped 
over at the King Ranch and went hunting down there a

12:15.460 --> 12:22.769
little bit, I think. And then Blocker sent his 
plane over to pick them up. And he also put them in

12:27.154 --> 12:32.500
the quarters for the Board of Regents over here at 
the MSC. And then that night, he wanted to

12:33.121 --> 12:42.052
introduce

12:33.121 --> 12:42.052
the fella from Texas in charge of all the oil. And 
here's what he said. He says, this is a great moment

12:45.565 --> 12:47.768
in history. Mexico has just discovered they've 
got all of this oil. And he said, they need to sell

12:54.177 --> 12:55.679
it. And there's not a better person to sell it than I 
am. That was the way he introduced him. And it

13:05.752 --> 13:15.285
wasn't, well, a year or two after they were chasing 
both of those all over the country, they were

13:05.752 --> 13:15.285
wanting to know where they'd hit out to because 
they'd absconded with some money. down there, but

13:15.873 --> 13:23.824
that was one of the cases where I did have a board of 
directors member involved. Actually, I knew Dr.

13:24.485 --> 13:27.349
Boydle, but not all that well. We used to go fishing 
down there, and I talked to him. But I wasn't around

13:33.818 --> 13:37.864
him enough just to know him personally like I did 
Rudder. All right, now I've about finished

13:39.295 --> 13:41.658
questions. Do you think of any topics that we 
should have talked about we didn't? It seems to me

13:45.464 --> 13:48.208
like we've covered an awful lot. All right. Let's 
see. One item is to say if you have at this point or

13:52.054 --> 14:04.071
any time in the future any papers, memorabilia, or 
anything else that you are going to dispose of, I

14:04.388 --> 14:10.079
beg you, please hand it over to the A&M archives so 
it'll be preserved forever. I think I've thrown

14:12.163 --> 14:14.227
about everything away already. Well, that's what 
I worry about is things getting thrown away

14:14.327 --> 14:24.827
because it is the accumulation that can help give a 
more clear picture of A&M. But, you know, we've had

14:24.807 --> 14:29.654
so little space at this place, we just didn't have 
room enough to store it. But see, now, over in the

14:29.674 --> 14:32.639
archives with the Cushing, they do. Okay, next to 
last question. Let's make believe that someone

14:37.826 --> 14:41.652
gives you a check for a million dollars. and it's a 
good solid check, and there's only one

14:43.032 --> 14:51.101
requirement, you have to pass it on to Texas A&M, 
and you decide what they should do with it. In other

14:51.582 --> 14:55.086
words, if you could give A&M a million dollars, 
what would you want them to do with it? Oh, I think it

14:56.087 --> 15:11.925
should, I'm not sure about other departments, but 
one of the places where we need money more than

14:56.087 --> 15:11.925
anywhere else, and it's the hardest raised, and 
that is graduate fellowships. You can raise money

15:13.542 --> 15:21.012
for undergraduate fellowships because most 
people can associate with them that were

15:13.542 --> 15:21.012
undergraduates that have gone out and done well. 
But the ones that's hardest is the graduate

15:21.573 --> 15:39.077
students and the, well that one wouldn't get very 
far on chairs as far as that goes, but I'd say with

15:21.573 --> 15:39.077
that amount of money that this would be helped with 
graduate fellowships so that we could attract

15:39.665 --> 15:42.769
some real good students. And I'd like to see them up 
the ante for U.S. citizens.

15:49.457 --> 15:51.018
I'm not sure I know what you mean there. That gives 
them a little better salary than we do foreigners

15:51.038 --> 15:58.127
to encourage more of our own citizens to go to 
graduate school. You're saying the stipend for

15:58.387 --> 16:00.369
graduate students. The stipend for graduate 
students. There's nothing in the world for us

16:02.392 --> 16:09.300
wrong with us being partial to our own students. 
And so we don't have to treat them exactly like we

16:10.090 --> 16:14.056
treat the foreigners. And so just to get some of 
ours in there so up against it that they'll come

16:14.316 --> 16:23.109
here under a different set of circumstances and 
our own people will. But we want our own people in

16:23.149 --> 16:28.237
the, we want them involved. And so we don't, in the 
industry and in the research, running the

16:28.477 --> 16:33.705
research organizations. And so we need to get 
those kind of people in graduate school and not all

16:33.765 --> 16:38.612
foreigners. Now, the Saudis didn't mind at all 
doing things like that because I was over there

16:39.014 --> 16:50.247
once, and the king was having trouble with all the 
young Saudis wanting to get out and drive

16:39.014 --> 16:50.247
automobiles up and down the beach. And a lot of them 
got into driving cabs. And so while I was there, he

16:53.650 --> 17:01.319
came out with a proclamation that no Saudi man 
could drive a cab until he was 30 years old. He

17:02.420 --> 17:04.903
figured by then the fever would have worn off. 
because they wanted their people to go to get an

17:06.419 --> 17:14.070
education and help run that country. And so I think 
we've got to do the same thing. All right, last

17:18.776 --> 17:19.698
question. After more than 50 years of service 
here, what feelings do you have in your heart for

17:21.280 --> 17:27.008
Texas A&M? Well, I think it's a great school, and I 
think that what we should have is One of the things I

17:35.900 --> 17:46.135
see wrong with hiring so many, we always think we 
have to hire an outsider, but a lot of times it's

17:35.900 --> 17:46.135
really I have a bag we'll travel. And I think that we 
need more people coming up through organization

17:47.357 --> 18:03.240
like they have in companies to where you know the 
culture and you have more dedicated people that

17:47.357 --> 18:03.240
will be, do what they think is best for the 
university and not always career-oriented

18:03.322 --> 18:07.348
what's best for me. And so I think that's one of the 
things that I would say is that we do need more of

18:08.129 --> 18:21.347
that so that we will get people who are dedicated, 
and I think people who have stayed with it a long

18:08.129 --> 18:21.347
time are dedicated and want to see the best for A&M.
