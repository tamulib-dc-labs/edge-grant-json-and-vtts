WEBVTT

00:00:02.545 --> 00:00:11.236
I've never had, except when I tried to do a little lobbying, I found I greatly disliked that and I was treated very rudely.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.604
The fellow didn't get reelected from a district in Fort Worth.

00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:30.780
He had a bunch of printers in his district who donated an awful lot of printing because of what he was doing to his opponent.

00:00:32.397 --> 00:00:38.066
My dealings with them have always been when they wanted something I was in a position to do.

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:45.819
Among the many lessons I learned, I'm very willing to, when I run things, to have them introduced.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.406
If we know they're there, just let us know, you know.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.733
Some of you like better than you like others.

00:00:54.915 --> 00:00:56.839
It's always difficult to do anything with Phil Graham.

00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:07.180
It's difficult to do some things with Joe Barton, and yet Joe himself has always been very pleasant to work with.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.781
All right.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:22.635
Looking back over all these years, did you ever feel that the fact that you were a woman led to any different treatment here on the campus?

00:01:24.037 --> 00:01:24.677
Better or worse?

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:26.119
Depends on what it was.

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:28.521
Sometimes it was better, sometimes it was worse.

00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:29.642
Can you give any examples?

00:01:30.363 --> 00:01:34.787
I think women

00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:40.584
can get away with saying things sometimes that another man can't get away with saying.

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:50.077
You can couch it in such a way, saying things that perhaps need to be said, but that a man would get pretty defensive if another man said it or did it.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:02:03.475
By the same token, I think men are far too quick to want to come to the aid of a woman who has a problem and to solve it for her.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:06.067
and that doesn't do anybody any good.

00:02:07.132 --> 00:02:10.528
I had...

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:21.135
How do you get in a touchy area?

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:22.376
I'm not sure I want to talk about that.

00:02:23.317 --> 00:02:23.598
Okay.

00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:33.590
Did anybody ever attempt in your early years to tell you how you should dress or anything like that?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.970
No.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.310
Nobody?

00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:35.231
No.

00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:36.473
Nobody assumed that role?

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:36.913
No.

00:02:37.134 --> 00:02:37.434
Okay.

00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:37.915
Not at all.

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:48.988
And did anybody ever infer that you got the job only because you were a woman?

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:49.088
Yes.

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:54.869
Because I'm assuming that none of us would like to hear that.

00:03:01.078 --> 00:03:01.359
Yes.

00:03:03.262 --> 00:03:18.805
I had a couple of people even suggest that there was a personal relationship that was the reason I got a job.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:28.643
One of them was angry when he said it, and I suggested he

00:03:30.513 --> 00:03:31.775
Well, first of all, I didn't answer.

00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:33.417
And finally he came back.

00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:34.378
He was over the telephone.

00:03:34.418 --> 00:03:35.940
He came back and said, I didn't mean that.

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:42.248
I said, I didn't think you did, but you might want to take it up with either David or Mac Prescott if you wish.

00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:49.778
Now, in those early years, you had three children in school.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.805
And how did you arrange that?

00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:57.128
Did you get them always off to school?

00:03:57.108 --> 00:03:57.990
before you came?

00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:59.675
David was nice about sharing that.

00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:00.618
Okay.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:10.645
And I've always been able to work full eight hours out of the

00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:14.051
I did not know Ed Kerber when I started working for him.

00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:14.792
I knew his wife.

00:04:14.872 --> 00:04:15.493
I knew Peggy.

00:04:15.994 --> 00:04:17.896
And I recognized Ed if he was with Peggy.

00:04:18.017 --> 00:04:19.138
There's Peggy and her husband.

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:20.980
What's his name?

00:04:22.142 --> 00:04:27.189
But Ed told me when I first went to work for him that, of course, Peggy worked and they had five children.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.196
He said he fully realized that there were some things a working mother had to do that couldn't be done before eight and after five.

00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:37.442
And as long as it didn't get out of hand, that was fine.

00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:43.635
And I appreciated that very, very much, and I've tried to remember that with others.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.303
Sometimes it was a problem.

00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:54.889
I don't think I ever forgot what came first in my life, and that was my family.

00:04:56.191 --> 00:05:04.341
As the boys got older, essentially how we worked it out in our household is that David and the boys kept house and I cooked.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.153
Then we finally started hiring part of that done, so.

00:05:09.173 --> 00:05:10.474
All right.

00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:22.287
Looking back on those years and now, are there some things that we should be doing differently regarding women professionals here at A&M?

00:05:26.631 --> 00:05:33.298
Well, it'd be nice if they were paid and promoted at the same standards in the faculty side.

00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:36.227
All right, you're saying you don't think they are?

00:05:36.287 --> 00:05:36.468
No.

00:05:36.808 --> 00:05:38.630
Okay.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.990
Come in.

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:43.155
We're going to finish this up pretty soon.

00:05:43.796 --> 00:06:01.395
As you look back on these years, who are the people that you think deserve the most credit for A&M's progress since the mid-'60s?

00:06:03.367 --> 00:06:04.709
Oh, that's a tough one.

00:06:07.874 --> 00:06:13.743
I don't think you can put your finger on any one or two people.

00:06:14.023 --> 00:06:15.586
No.

00:06:16.727 --> 00:06:19.772
I think, and I've thought about this fairly recently.

00:06:21.203 --> 00:06:32.380
I think to some extent we're still reaping the benefits of some really fine stuff that was done here in the late 70s and early 80s.

00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:50.147
When you look at the faculty members who are still bringing a lot of recognition to the campus, a lot of them were here in place at that time.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.522
Nobody has been perfect.

00:06:55.564 --> 00:07:05.357
I can think back to former board members who certainly had their flaws and their faults.

00:07:05.957 --> 00:07:08.961
Some of them have been really pointed out publicly.

00:07:10.383 --> 00:07:12.606
And yet I can see some really good things they did.

00:07:12.626 --> 00:07:20.415
And if they did it for the wrong reasons, I don't think they did it.

00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:21.737
I don't think so.

00:07:22.932 --> 00:07:48.315
um i think that a m has been truly fortunate in we've proven let's put it this way that it didn't really matter who was president uh the kids are the best thing we've got going here and this mystique with the kids

00:07:48.852 --> 00:08:09.561
we still get for the most part the kids who come here already with strong values from their families and their churches and their communities and from day one actually before day one we start telling them they're different and we tell them that their whole time they're in school and they buy into it but it's a

00:08:12.612 --> 00:08:17.397
It's the kids that really make this place special and unique.

00:08:18.578 --> 00:08:33.512
The faculty members, and you know this as well as I do, we get faculty members here and some of them never buy into it, never feel comfortable with it, and generally don't stay very long.

00:08:34.613 --> 00:08:38.417
The ones who do and who do feel comfortable with it, whatever,

00:08:38.937 --> 00:08:43.202
end up almost as rabid as some of the kids are.

00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:55.837
But my hero, the one person in all of this, my hero in studying back and forth is Sterling Evans.

00:08:56.778 --> 00:09:03.966
I am personally convinced from what I've read and what I've heard and all that he's

00:09:05.617 --> 00:09:08.921
Mr. Evans was the one that wound Rudder up and sent him into battle.

00:09:10.462 --> 00:09:16.569
And he's the one that plotted the strategy and what would happen.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:22.195
So I guess if I have anybody, it would be Sterling Evans.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.038
You'd put him first in the Hall of Honor?

00:09:25.058 --> 00:09:26.059
First in the Hall of Honor.

00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:31.725
Yeah.

00:09:33.697 --> 00:09:37.203
Okay, let's see, two other things then.

00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:45.579
What has it meant to you that you've been here at this place all these years?

00:09:49.626 --> 00:09:50.568
I can't talk about that.

00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:54.996
I can understand that answer.

00:09:58.418 --> 00:10:06.992
Because I suspect you're like I might have ended up somewhere else just as easily as here and how different our lives would have been.

00:10:08.053 --> 00:10:09.716
All right, an easier question.

00:10:09.736 --> 00:10:12.540
No, let me go back to that a little bit.

00:10:15.184 --> 00:10:18.530
Mac Prescott told me one time, he was encouraging me to leave.

00:10:20.693 --> 00:10:22.135
And you've probably heard him say this.

00:10:22.977 --> 00:10:25.781
He said, if you hang around A&M long enough, it'll break your heart.

00:10:26.142 --> 00:10:26.282
Mm-hmm.

00:10:28.355 --> 00:10:32.721
I hear you.

00:10:33.623 --> 00:10:41.955
Let's make believe somebody gives you a million dollar check and the only requirement is you've got to give it to A&M but you decide what's going to be done with it.

00:10:46.662 --> 00:10:51.329
If you had a million dollars to give to A&M and you could decide how it's going to be used.

00:10:57.437 --> 00:10:57.838
I would

00:10:59.438 --> 00:11:03.844
probably give at least half of it to the student retreat center they're wanting to build.

00:11:06.348 --> 00:11:10.073
And the other half...

00:11:16.582 --> 00:11:21.169
I got this added on the capital campaign and some work has been done.

00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:29.260
The other half for endowments for the children of our

00:11:31.670 --> 00:12:01.677
uh classified employees who make below a certain amount and i'm not sure what that amount where that should be set below 25 000 something like that we have a lot of folks many of minorities whose own children never dream of coming to school out here and their parents work here their whole life and uh i got it i say i got it at it

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.999
to the endowment campaign.

00:12:07.003 --> 00:12:18.182
Got Robert on it, and Robert put some of the coke money toward it, but... All right, let's quit with that.

00:12:18.783 --> 00:12:19.645
Thank you.

00:12:19.665 --> 00:12:19.785
Okay.

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:20.526
I didn't mean to cry.
