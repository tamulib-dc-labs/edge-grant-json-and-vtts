WEBVTT

00:01.398 --> 00:24.239
So, I went to Ernie Reinke, who was then the head of the Department of Plant Breeding and Agronomy and Plant Breeding at Minnesota, who incidentally, he and I started the freshman year together at Minnesota, and I've known him all down through the years, and I said, look, I'd like to go and see Dr. Hayes, but he's in this situation mentally.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.902
He probably won't even recognize me.

00:27.382 --> 00:29.304
Would you be willing to go with me?

00:29.324 --> 00:30.105
And he said, sure.

00:30.794 --> 00:33.958
So we went over and we walked in.

00:34.459 --> 00:40.648
He still looked fine, but he was all befuddled.

00:42.090 --> 00:47.317
And Ernie says, you remember Norm Borlaug?

00:47.337 --> 00:48.118
And he said, yes.

00:48.739 --> 00:51.242
And you could see that he just kind of startled.

00:51.923 --> 00:56.970
He said, why didn't we know that wheat was photoperiod sensitive?

00:57.895 --> 01:05.145
And I said, because the experiment stations in the state of Minnesota, at Waseca, St.

01:05.185 --> 01:10.793
Paul, and Crookston, were too close to the same latitude.

01:10.813 --> 01:11.414
And he was gone.

01:14.679 --> 01:22.530
It must have been bugging him for, and why that connection was made for those few seconds, it seems incredible to me.

01:24.853 --> 01:24.953
Okay.

01:24.973 --> 01:25.033
Aw.

01:26.060 --> 01:28.383
And that's probably the answer.

01:29.785 --> 01:39.679
That shirt was there but it made contact for a few seconds and his eyes got brilliant and like he used to just stare at you.

01:39.699 --> 01:42.102
That's probably the answer though, isn't it?

01:42.122 --> 01:43.324
I imagine.

01:43.344 --> 01:44.385
I have no other answer.

01:46.068 --> 01:48.591
It's curious how these things look.

01:49.364 --> 01:52.647
And then he just seeped back into his metal frame.

01:53.849 --> 01:53.949
Yeah.

01:53.969 --> 01:59.835
And then a year later, these things were going on and it was moving in the Bahio where these things fit also.

01:59.955 --> 02:02.077
Okay, now we're back in 48.

02:02.097 --> 02:02.477
Yeah, 48.

02:02.497 --> 02:08.804
We harvested those plots and I took them through on this truck, like I was saying, with all the difficulties.

02:09.284 --> 02:14.730
And Rupert went back with the pickup the other way because he didn't have any, he wasn't carrying anything.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.612
And we planted them that summer.

02:16.752 --> 02:17.953
We blew them up.

02:18.187 --> 02:19.648
multiplied them, in other words.

02:20.809 --> 02:23.252
Did you plan on these farmers' plots now?

02:23.492 --> 02:27.195
Were they eager to have more planning on their... Oh, yes.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.196
They were ready by then.

02:28.256 --> 02:29.638
Everybody wanted them.

02:29.658 --> 02:29.758
Yeah.

02:29.778 --> 02:34.883
And then there was a lot of black market salesmanship going on.

02:34.903 --> 02:44.852
Part of the seed went to the government agency, of course, which started at a regular price, but part... We had to find out whether they had any acceptance.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.481
There's only one way to do it.

02:46.501 --> 02:48.664
There wasn't any seed organization at that time.

02:49.005 --> 02:51.228
There wasn't any extension service.

02:51.248 --> 02:54.672
We were everything.

02:54.692 --> 02:56.134
And so that's the way it went.

02:56.254 --> 03:00.500
The next year, of course, these seeds were distributed to farmers.

03:01.401 --> 03:07.188
And then they started to try to form a seed organization, which was pretty anemic and never worked too well.

03:09.772 --> 03:14.518
The next farmer's field day, there was a lot of more enthusiasm and more farmers.

03:15.275 --> 03:34.201
and a year later, and by then we said, all right, and the young engineer or agronomist who was with me, had been with me for several years then, I had him explain the whole breeding program like I had done in my broken Spanish before, but I said, today we're going to show you something else.

03:34.742 --> 03:38.166
We're going to show you the response of fertilizer to these soils.

03:39.869 --> 03:44.455
We have now, this is the third plantings, there you can see the plots, the ones with

03:44.688 --> 03:52.538
fertilizer, and without, with both nitrogen and phosphorus, and with nitrogen alone, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash.

03:52.558 --> 03:55.922
The only response is to nitrogen on these soils at the present time.

03:55.962 --> 03:57.123
And you can see how big it is.

03:58.625 --> 04:00.547
And I said last year it was on the order of 60%.

04:00.567 --> 04:00.988
60%?

04:01.008 --> 04:05.914
60% crop improvement?

04:07.316 --> 04:09.278
Over the good variety.

04:10.422 --> 04:13.146
On top of the good variety.

04:13.186 --> 04:17.954
Just because nitrogen fertilizer was used?

04:17.974 --> 04:19.256
And so I explained it.

04:19.276 --> 04:22.621
And how did that change versus different elevations?

04:22.641 --> 04:24.965
Well, that's with different soil types.

04:24.985 --> 04:25.506
Oh, okay.

04:25.586 --> 04:31.215
In the Bahio, in the central of Mexico, it would have been greater, which I haven't gone into.

04:31.235 --> 04:32.397
But at Overgon, we're talking.

04:32.832 --> 05:02.181
So as I explained this, I was standing up on the bed of the pickup, and the first three people standing in front of me was Rodolfo Caiz, and Eduardo Vargas, and the third farmer who was probably the best of the bunch, whose name right now escapes me, but I'll tell you in a minute.

05:02.363 --> 05:05.787
Anyway, I explained it, and I said, are there any questions?

05:08.070 --> 05:10.833
Jorge Parada was the third one.

05:10.853 --> 05:13.756
And there was a deathly silence.

05:15.478 --> 05:20.824
And finally, Jorge Parada said, and I think he probably was an even better farmer than Calice.

05:22.206 --> 05:25.510
He said, no, Dr. Borlaug, and he spoke good English.

05:25.570 --> 05:30.936
When he was speaking to me in English, he wanted to make sure that I understood it.

05:32.097 --> 05:34.400
He said, I don't want you to misunderstand.

05:34.880 --> 05:40.247
We greatly appreciate what's been done on the new varieties.

05:41.128 --> 05:41.869
They're wonderful.

05:41.909 --> 05:45.854
They're going to make us a lot of money, and we're going to produce a lot more food.

05:46.815 --> 05:50.219
But there's something wrong here, and it's not your fault.

05:50.479 --> 05:52.401
We know that you haven't had machinery.

05:52.441 --> 05:54.164
You couldn't prepare good seed beds.

05:54.804 --> 05:57.027
Everything has been out of your control.

05:58.108 --> 06:02.053
But this is the best soil in the world.

06:02.860 --> 06:05.483
you won't get that kind of a response on my farm.

06:06.705 --> 06:09.368
This is because this is badly farmed.

06:09.508 --> 06:10.609
It's not your fault.

06:10.629 --> 06:11.750
Don't misunderstand.

06:11.770 --> 06:14.414
These are factors beyond your control.

06:15.074 --> 06:18.618
And I said, what did he mean it was badly farmed?

06:19.399 --> 06:28.270
There was no machinery and so it had been abandoned many years and not farmed properly and the seed beds were probably poorly prepared by the way he did it.

06:29.011 --> 06:32.715
The irrigation was probably inadequate compared to his standards.

06:33.151 --> 06:47.749
And so, according to him, I was confusing other factors that were beyond my control because of not having decent equipment and management at the experimental station where this was being conducted.

06:48.951 --> 07:01.707
And I said, well, Don Horky, next year I'm going to have a young agronomist who's going to put on, if we can get a pickup, about tests like this on

07:01.940 --> 07:04.584
10 or 11 farms, that's all we'll be able to manage.

07:05.245 --> 07:10.974
And I want one of those tests to be on your farm, if you'll permit me, and one on Don Rodolfo's.

07:14.419 --> 07:20.188
And so we got verbal agreement, and then that changed.

07:20.228 --> 07:27.319
Not immediately, there were also, with Jorge Parada, the same guy that was raising the questions.

07:28.020 --> 07:29.162
The next year,

07:29.969 --> 07:39.124
First, we had good results everywhere where we put experiments that we controlled, experimental plots.

07:39.244 --> 07:50.863
But he took this new seed and he had about a five-cornered piece, completely irregular, close to the house where he wanted to keep it and make sure nobody, I guess, ran away with his seed.

07:51.518 --> 07:57.546
And so what he did was put on what he thought was half fertilizer and the other half unfertilized.

07:58.047 --> 08:01.351
And I went to see it before I left for Mexico.

08:02.092 --> 08:07.239
And you could see it was much better than the rest, than the unfertilized.

08:08.400 --> 08:14.368
And yet I got a note from him, said that the results were the same, no yield difference.

08:14.388 --> 08:15.910
And I knew that there was something wrong.

08:17.312 --> 08:18.994
And he wrote me a letter

08:19.447 --> 08:23.831
and I told him there was something wrong, and he said, all right, we'll repeat it again next year.

08:24.391 --> 08:26.113
And so, he put it on again.

08:26.153 --> 08:31.277
I went to see it, and he hadn't harvested when I left for Mexico City.

08:31.938 --> 08:33.699
In hell, it was double.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.882
And I said, Jorge, there's something wrong.

08:38.163 --> 08:39.144
I don't know what you're doing.

08:40.265 --> 08:45.329
Is somebody stealing your seed and selling it, or what's going on?

08:45.349 --> 08:49.032
About six weeks later, he came in with a sheepish

08:50.547 --> 08:56.793
look on his face to my office in Mexico City and he said, I want to apologize for two things.

08:56.813 --> 09:04.962
One, I just told my foreman to draw a line right across the middle of that in different angles.

09:05.682 --> 09:17.234
He says, it turns out when I went out and measured it personally, that the part that was unfertilized was essentially twice as big as the other because of these irregularities.

09:18.235 --> 09:20.217
And he said, now to show

09:20.669 --> 09:25.896
So they were putting on half the fertilizer of what they needed.

09:25.916 --> 09:28.920
Well, he meant to leave half unfertilized for comparison.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.782
But, yes.

09:32.064 --> 09:37.491
But on the other plot, there were really only minor treatment when they needed a full treatment.

09:37.511 --> 09:38.592
Right.

09:38.612 --> 09:39.994
And then he said,

09:41.071 --> 09:55.970
I'm embarrassed to tell you this because it shows that I didn't control this situation very well, but I've just accepted the job or the distributorship for Shell and Hydro's Ammonia.

09:58.813 --> 10:01.857
So he became the fertilizer for this non-believer.

10:02.898 --> 10:07.744
Then we were home free very soon, except other things happened.

10:07.764 --> 10:10.588
The next wall when I came up, this was

10:11.429 --> 10:13.752
Well, I got ahead once more.

10:13.872 --> 10:15.655
So he became the fertilizer distributor.

10:16.075 --> 10:18.699
For shell ammonia, anhydrous ammonia.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.580
In that area.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.982
Yeah, I should have said.

10:21.002 --> 10:22.204
He must have become a very wealthy man.

10:23.045 --> 10:25.929
Yes, he's passed down to greener pastures also.

10:26.530 --> 10:29.594
But I should have mentioned one other thing.

10:29.614 --> 10:39.107
That fall, when we went up to a range where we were going to put those plots, on the farms with the

10:40.673 --> 10:44.518
Mercado, Raul Mercado, who became a very successful farmer.

10:44.538 --> 10:47.422
He only stayed with me two years on this fertilizer testing.

10:48.183 --> 10:51.488
And then he wanted to go into farming.

10:53.050 --> 10:55.393
He was a very capable individual.

10:55.413 --> 10:58.017
I'm sorry to see him go.

10:58.037 --> 11:00.240
He even, he says, I got to get started.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.723
He says, I really believe that I want to be a farmer.

11:03.144 --> 11:07.069
And as a matter of fact, I think I loaned him the first $400 as a friend.

11:07.943 --> 11:16.134
and he became a millionaire, but that's another story, on darn good farming, one of the best, the new generation.

11:16.154 --> 11:28.990
But when we were looking around where to put those plots, suddenly Roberto Mauri said, you know, that field day last year when you explained this fertilizer, right after that,

11:29.999 --> 11:47.145
There's a guy turned up at the farmers' co-op, and by then he was president of the farmers' co-op, Roberto Mauri, the brother of this Aggie, whom I had helped, and he was getting to be a pretty respectable farmer, and as a result, he was elected president of this co-op.

11:48.247 --> 11:55.979
And he said, this person came in, and he said, we're going to set up a laboratory here.

11:56.039 --> 11:58.723
We're going to sell good crop, fertilizer.

11:59.024 --> 12:02.287
It was a Denver, Colorado outfit.

12:02.787 --> 12:06.451
And he said, we're going to perform soil analysis free.

12:07.572 --> 12:10.414
And they hired some girls here and they set up a laboratory.

12:14.018 --> 12:23.006
But they already sold Rodolfo Caius a whole carload full of fertilizer and two other farmers.

12:24.487 --> 12:27.310
And I said, Roberto, what is that fertilizer?

12:28.117 --> 12:32.642
He said, I don't know, but I'll go in the warehouse there, and I'll give you the label.

12:32.662 --> 12:39.709
And they brought out a label, and it was 2020.

12:40.150 --> 12:43.313
The only response we got was nitrogen.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.194
It was 2%.

12:46.136 --> 12:51.902
And I thought, God almighty, that's all we need now, and this will set us back another 10 years.

12:52.242 --> 12:54.205
Rodolfo is buying that fertilizer.

12:54.225 --> 12:55.626
He won't get any response from it.

12:57.648 --> 13:05.538
So I told Roberto that I want to talk to this entrepreneur, fertilizer salesman.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.264
And it was set up that I would see him next morning at nine o'clock.

13:11.425 --> 13:15.170
This was before planting of this.

13:15.190 --> 13:22.399
And I went over there and walked into this little office laboratory setup that they have.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.702
And the secretary said, I'm sorry,

13:24.952 --> 13:30.880
Mr. So-and-so had to leave on the midnight train last night for Mexico.

13:30.900 --> 13:36.888
He obviously knew that they were selling the wrong kind of fertilizer for that area, but he was making a fast buck.

13:37.810 --> 13:45.600
So then I went to Rodolfo, and I figured Rodolfo would tell the rest of them.

13:45.621 --> 13:49.626
I said, you know, you bought the wrong kind of fertilizer.

13:50.821 --> 13:57.609
I said, there's nothing wrong with the fertilizer, but the fertilizer doesn't fit the soil, that problem that we've got here.

13:58.190 --> 14:02.375
The only part of that formula that will pay you anything is the 2%.

14:05.618 --> 14:08.342
And you're paying for all of the rest of it.

14:08.362 --> 14:09.583
He says, I haven't paid for it.

14:09.683 --> 14:13.508
I said, for God's sakes, turn back to it.

14:13.888 --> 14:15.650
Don't pay for it.

14:15.670 --> 14:20.676
Well, he insisted he was going to keep part of it, but he turned most of it back, and the other people did too.

14:21.078 --> 14:23.342
Otherwise, we'd have been set back another ten years.

14:23.522 --> 14:23.923
Oh, sure.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.828
They would have had no confidence in you folks at all.

14:27.850 --> 14:30.014
And so did you get the right type of fertilizer?

14:30.515 --> 14:30.635
Yes.

14:30.655 --> 14:32.057
Wouldn't you need ten percent hydrogen?

14:32.078 --> 14:34.101
No, we just wanted pure ammonium sulfate.

14:34.121 --> 14:41.955
That's all we could get at that time, which is about twenty percent, eighteen and a half, twenty percent nitrogen, and that's all of the rest is inert.

14:42.661 --> 15:06.880
later it got to be urea and then anhydrous ammonia a year later when this parada after he'd seen the results and remeasured then he got to be the distributor for anhydrous ammonia and that's a large part of it's either urea or anhydrous ammonia of course today some of those soils now begin to respond to phosphorus also so that

15:07.315 --> 15:14.163
You've got a different pattern depending on crop rotations in the area because of the change in extraction of nutrients.

15:15.385 --> 15:20.991
But you see, you've got to go through all of these jungles, barbed wire fences.

15:22.273 --> 15:35.348
And this was my first experience in Mexico that I had to go through and many other countries as you try to go through change from an old technology, the old ways and the old methods to a new.

15:36.256 --> 15:40.381
But you learn from those pitfalls you've been through.

15:41.783 --> 15:44.446
A lot of it's just the confidence of the people that you're working with.

15:44.466 --> 15:45.988
Of course.

15:46.008 --> 15:53.898
And that's why in most foreign technical assistance programs today, this still doesn't come through.

15:53.918 --> 16:02.949
They think that there's some magic that a person can go from a university into one of those third world countries and say, do this, do that, do the other.

16:03.810 --> 16:04.751
And it won't work.

16:05.192 --> 16:05.993
First of all,

16:06.631 --> 16:16.625
Just looking casually, you don't know whether there is a technology that you're recommending, what the increase in productivity will be if they do that.

16:17.526 --> 16:18.468
It's not been tested.

16:18.928 --> 16:19.910
It's a hypothesis.

16:21.913 --> 16:30.765
And even if there have been some experiments made and you see the data, you're telling them

16:31.117 --> 16:44.990
without them having confidence in you, having seen you operate in their country, getting to know your philosophy and how much faith to put into you, they'll think you're a fast salesman.

16:45.851 --> 16:54.339
And I have learned that this is one of the great weaknesses of USAID Foreign Technical Assistance Program.

16:54.679 --> 16:58.002
They have had lots of good scientists, but they're left generally

16:58.690 --> 17:08.198
for only two or at the most three years in a given country and then they're moved on to different places because they're under the policies of the State Department.

17:08.258 --> 17:10.560
That's the way the State Department operates.

17:11.761 --> 17:23.572
And so this explains in a large part why it has been very difficult for USAID to have had good impact even though they've had brilliant scientists.

17:24.292 --> 17:28.596
They have not had continuity and I have never been cursed with that

17:29.251 --> 17:33.416
because I've worked in many countries.

17:33.817 --> 17:47.234
I never tried to move a change until I have good confidence that the package of technology that we are promoting has the possibility of increasing the yield at least 50 percent.

17:47.254 --> 17:55.765
Sometimes it can be 100 or 200 percent once, and if it can be done when you need shock, I prefer to show them that 200

17:55.998 --> 18:09.939
than the 50 percent, because this shocks people to the bottom of their roots, and it generates grass root fires.

18:10.680 --> 18:15.707
The farmers suddenly see that what can happen, what the potential is.

18:16.008 --> 18:17.029
Sure.

18:17.410 --> 18:19.693
And so, basically what we're saying here

18:29.950 --> 18:45.579
or so, when you had convinced the farmers and you had come up with this new type of seed, your production, and plus the fertilizer, using the fertilizer, that the production increase about 60 percent per acre.

18:47.482 --> 18:51.570
That it was achievable, and that it was actually reached on some farms.

18:55.938 --> 18:58.580
Well, of course, there were a few farms at that time.

18:58.600 --> 19:05.726
And it was like that, and sometimes more, depending if they put that fertilizer together with the other, it was 100%.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.749
But it didn't happen all at once in different places.

19:08.769 --> 19:16.195
Lots of things were happening all at once, and there was plenty of disorder, which is not bad, because the good results, they get to the ears of the others.

19:16.736 --> 19:22.260
And then through our field days, every year we would tighten it up and give them insights.

19:22.601 --> 19:25.303
And it soon got to a point where, before planting,

19:25.992 --> 19:27.675
I would put out a little folder.

19:27.695 --> 19:30.740
Every year we'd have them printed up in the office and ahead.

19:31.101 --> 19:37.692
By then we had an extension, week extension service that was spun off from the people trained in research.

19:38.493 --> 19:40.636
They were around in the major areas.

19:41.277 --> 19:49.992
And so, starting in September or early October, a month or so, six weeks before planting,

19:50.377 --> 19:56.565
The extension people would organize a farmers' meeting in different places, and I would stop.

19:57.146 --> 19:58.788
Maybe in two weeks I would talk.

19:59.028 --> 20:02.112
By then there was a little better transportation around the country, too.

20:02.553 --> 20:11.845
This was, let's say, in 52 or so, 53.

20:12.905 --> 20:15.949
They'd have a meeting set up, sometimes at night, sometimes during the day.

20:16.509 --> 20:19.913
There'd be 50, there'd be 100 farmers, sometimes more.

20:21.355 --> 20:22.396
We'd hand out the folders.

20:22.496 --> 20:26.261
I'd tell them about the intricacies and the things to be careful about.

20:28.223 --> 20:32.148
I did it myself the first couple of years, and then the young people were with me.

20:32.248 --> 20:33.709
They would do it, and I'd be with them.

20:34.771 --> 20:42.760
If there were things that kind of got poorly explained, I would put my two cents worth in.

20:43.499 --> 20:46.362
and soon was on the radio from these meetings.

20:47.763 --> 21:07.361
And in those two weeks' time, I would probably have contact directly, personally, with a couple of, oh, with 1,000 to 2,000 people, farmers, and plus the radio, and plus the local publicity, and these folders were left everywhere, and it started going.

21:07.381 --> 21:10.544
Not only into Nora, but by heel, we got it going the same way.

21:10.985 --> 21:13.287
And there, because those lands had been

21:13.621 --> 21:15.803
Farmed longer.

21:16.084 --> 21:20.028
They were at lower levels of fertility even than Sonora.

21:20.048 --> 21:24.173
Some of them we had to have both nitrogen and phosphorus.

21:25.374 --> 21:26.115
Fantastic.

21:27.616 --> 21:28.658
The way things changed.

21:31.020 --> 21:36.346
But we had one other thing that we had to do.

21:37.467 --> 21:38.949
And that had to do with pricing.

21:39.229 --> 21:41.672
First, what kind of fertilizer?

21:41.712 --> 21:42.733
And where do you get it?

21:43.372 --> 21:45.596
And what's the price?

21:45.776 --> 21:47.420
What about credit for buying it?

21:48.462 --> 21:54.232
And Rodolfo was the guy that was carrying the flame on this because he organized the first farm cooperatives.

21:55.174 --> 21:58.480
And then the question of price of grain at harvest.

22:00.143 --> 22:03.169
And in the case of wheat, because of the long-

22:04.533 --> 22:05.114
Beg pardon?

22:05.134 --> 22:06.436
Didn't it have to drop?

22:06.456 --> 22:08.299
No, because they were importing big quantities.

22:08.319 --> 22:09.180
Oh, that's right.

22:09.201 --> 22:09.721
That's right.

22:09.741 --> 22:10.803
They were importing it.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.990
And so I would talk this over with Harar early.

22:15.210 --> 22:17.414
This was before we had the big payoff.

22:17.434 --> 22:25.647
I said, the first thing we've got to do, I'd go through the old parts of Mexico and hell, they'd get a pittance for their week.

22:26.065 --> 22:30.331
Millers would say it's poor quality, it's all mixed types, and it was.

22:30.351 --> 22:36.699
It's from the old colonial times, some of it, a mixture of 10, 15, 20 types.

22:36.719 --> 22:46.753
And I told Herar, I said, we've got to get some changes done here on this, or these poor people can't sell their crop.

22:46.773 --> 22:50.638
Even if they learn to produce more, it'll be a losing proposition.

22:52.272 --> 22:55.376
So we talked it over, and I said, let's go down and see the minister.

22:55.897 --> 23:00.564
So we did, and we'd say, look, it's a simple solution.

23:00.944 --> 23:04.610
You're importing more than half the wheat that you're consuming.

23:06.512 --> 23:17.368
Don't give any import permits to the mills until they have bought all of the domestically produced wheat at a fair price relating to the international price.

23:20.048 --> 23:21.870
And he just did this.

23:21.890 --> 23:26.475
And since he controlled the imports, we never had any struggle.

23:27.877 --> 23:29.599
And it should make him look good too.

23:29.679 --> 23:30.099
Sure.

23:30.239 --> 23:31.621
Because the farmers loved him.

23:31.641 --> 23:31.881
Sure.

23:32.282 --> 23:37.588
And then Caius, he went a step farther because of the domestic prices.

23:39.049 --> 23:47.239
He says, and we soon, even though we didn't have the laboratory when we did it, we pulled off a real good one on the first yaki and mayo wheats.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.520
They were excellent quality.

23:49.647 --> 24:00.078
as good, really better than the ones that they were importing, which was the soft red wheats of Oklahoma, Texas, because it was closer by transport.

24:00.458 --> 24:04.142
Whereas these were related to Minnesota and North Dakota wheats and Canadians.

24:04.282 --> 24:09.727
They were hard red springs, and one of the parents was a Minnesota wheat new thatch.

24:10.308 --> 24:16.414
And they had quality characteristics that were very much like the Minnesota parent.

24:17.035 --> 24:20.781
And we had verified this by testing it in a few samples.

24:20.841 --> 24:27.291
We could only send out 10 or 12 to the USDA, and they milled them and baked them to General Mills.

24:27.972 --> 24:29.194
They did it out of courtesy.

24:30.176 --> 24:32.680
And we knew that they were good quality.

24:33.261 --> 24:41.734
And finally, but before they hit the market, Rodolfo, by then he was tuned in on all wavelengths.

24:41.754 --> 24:44.899
He says, all right, we're going to get the price we should get for this.

24:45.453 --> 24:51.419
and representing all of the organized farmers in the state of Sonora before planting.

24:51.880 --> 25:02.591
He had it organized that for the government buying agency, they would have a meeting and they would decide what the price was going to be at harvest.

25:03.752 --> 25:08.357
So the farmers could plan on the fertilizer and how much they were going to put into that crop.

25:09.198 --> 25:12.962
And he used to invite me to sit in with them in those early times.

25:13.617 --> 25:16.961
And so you were getting close to him in many ways.

25:17.682 --> 25:25.292
Much later, in other countries, where we didn't have a Rodolfo Caius who would carry the ball, then you had to do it yourself.

25:25.372 --> 25:26.734
But you'd been through those wars.

25:27.454 --> 25:28.316
You knew how to do it.

25:29.157 --> 25:42.173
And, you know, seldom do I reflect on all of these, how you used your experience in one place and you used the leadership of people to carry it on elsewhere.

25:43.081 --> 25:50.951
And, of course, Caius, once he was convinced, he came out to me, and this was considerably later.

25:50.971 --> 25:54.435
But he said, I'm convinced.

25:55.296 --> 26:05.969
Now, what do we have to do to put this station, experimental station, back into operating conditions so that you can keep a good staff here and live decently?

26:07.010 --> 26:10.995
Because it's miserable the way you've had to operate.

26:13.203 --> 26:18.448
We talked it over, and I said, well, there are no rural schools out here.

26:19.129 --> 26:20.971
The drinking water is horrible.

26:21.031 --> 26:21.812
It's full of salt.

26:23.453 --> 26:26.617
We've got to drive these dusty roads during the dry season.

26:27.758 --> 26:37.608
There's poor transportation for a long time to come, and the government agencies, they won't have enough transport to take care of the families.

26:37.628 --> 26:40.611
It's raining and muddy roads in the summertime.

26:41.350 --> 26:54.547
So I said, why don't we look for a place, a piece of land close to Ciudad Obregón, where we aren't burdened with the administration of all of the family problems.

26:55.207 --> 26:56.169
That you would be way out there.

26:56.189 --> 26:57.370
That we would way out there.

26:58.071 --> 27:01.195
Now, this has all changed now because it's all paved roads.

27:01.215 --> 27:02.537
But it wasn't then.

27:03.678 --> 27:04.479
And he listened.

27:04.499 --> 27:06.802
So he started to look for a new area.

27:06.822 --> 27:08.324
And he listened.

27:08.344 --> 27:09.265
He said, all right.

27:10.814 --> 27:23.013
This was in 60, let's see, by 62.

27:23.033 --> 27:25.237
It took that long?

27:25.417 --> 27:28.241
Before we went and bought the thing.

27:28.261 --> 27:31.987
You mean it took from 46 basically until 62?

27:32.949 --> 27:38.998
Before they actually bought the new land, but they helped improve the situation before that in this way.

27:39.620 --> 27:44.848
Once he saw things were changing, he said, all right, we're going to help.

27:45.268 --> 27:45.989
What can we do?

27:46.350 --> 27:48.794
And I said, we can't get anything here through government channels.

27:48.854 --> 27:54.742
We order simple notebooks and pencils and the simplest of things, little thrashing machines.

27:54.902 --> 27:55.624
We can't get them.

27:56.405 --> 28:00.971
He said, all right, I'm going to find a way to do this.

28:01.713 --> 28:05.458
And so this must have been in about 56 years.

28:07.565 --> 28:31.210
He established, not by law, but an agreement first in Sonora, in the co-ops there, in Cesar de Overegon, that every bag of wheat that they sold, every bale of cotton that they sold, they would take out at point of sale so much, a small amount, and it would go into a fund.

28:32.253 --> 28:40.865
that they would administer under what was called a patronato para investigación agricola.

28:41.386 --> 28:46.753
It would be like our patron saint in support of agricultural research.

28:46.773 --> 29:00.893
They elected their own officers for two years, president of vice president and treasurer, and a representative of the Ministry of Agriculture was an ex officio representative to see that there was no hanky-panky.

29:02.459 --> 29:04.341
They would sit with the local director.

29:04.401 --> 29:10.668
By then, we had the beginnings of some fairly well-trained people.

29:10.688 --> 29:15.233
By the time it came into full flower, it didn't happen overnight.

29:15.833 --> 29:17.996
The first two years, they collected the money.

29:18.056 --> 29:21.940
They sent it into the director general of agriculture's office.

29:24.162 --> 29:28.106
None of it came back so that we could use it.

29:28.807 --> 29:29.648
It just disappeared.

29:30.708 --> 29:49.988
So Rodolfo Caius went storming down, and he said, look, he went to the director general's office, and he said, he says, I don't doubt but what this money was used for experimental purposes somewhere, probably down in Yucatan for growing hinnikin or for pineapples in Veracruz.

29:50.668 --> 29:51.489
That's your business.

29:52.330 --> 29:58.977
But it's my business when it's Sonora, farmer's money that's used in Yucatan or in Veracruz.

29:59.311 --> 30:06.379
That money has to come back to Sonora for use on crops that we gave it for.

30:07.541 --> 30:27.664
And there was wrestling around there for months, but by about 19... I could tell you the exact time for my notebooks in Mexico, but it would probably have been by about 1950...

30:29.028 --> 30:30.350
eight or so.

30:31.312 --> 30:47.923
It was agreed that the money would not be sent to Mexico, but this committee would be formed and by then administered locally to direct support through the local representative of the Ministry of Agriculture, who was supporting research.

30:49.666 --> 30:52.251
And then in

30:57.496 --> 30:59.339
I said, 65, this is 55.

31:01.322 --> 31:05.187
By 55, when he said, all right, what about fixing up this station?

31:06.489 --> 31:09.834
And I told him, no, look for land.

31:09.854 --> 31:23.313
And he went out the same year, found a, he got his hat in hand, and he went to all the agribusiness, all the commercial businesses, and from the farmer's co-ops, and he got enough land, money to buy 100 hectares of irrigated land.

31:23.454 --> 31:27.199
It was just being opened up, the new high canal from a second dam.

31:28.968 --> 31:32.731
That has grown into... And how far was that Obregón now?

31:33.692 --> 31:34.273
Six miles.

31:34.653 --> 31:35.434
Oh, wonderful.

31:35.454 --> 31:36.335
By then on a paved road.

31:37.035 --> 31:39.918
Well, it wasn't paved then, but it's, of course, paved now.

31:39.938 --> 31:46.344
And that station now is called the CIANO, which is the acronym for the... C-I-A-N-O.

31:46.364 --> 31:46.584
Right.

31:47.605 --> 31:58.435
That's the Spanish acronym for the Northwest Center for Agricultural Research.

31:59.933 --> 32:09.625
Ciano is Centro, I is Investigacion, A is Agricola del Noroeste, of the Northwest.

32:10.446 --> 32:12.448
It's a regional research headquarters.

32:13.249 --> 32:17.274
There's several satellite stations now scattered around the state.

32:17.554 --> 32:20.057
Okay, and that was established in 1962 then?

32:20.418 --> 32:22.040
That was established, no.

32:22.200 --> 32:28.928
It was, the land must have been bought in 1950,

32:32.131 --> 32:36.676
And we planted on it the first time in 56.

32:40.901 --> 32:48.591
And it has grown into, and it was originally under our administrative direction, the foundation.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.714
Our program finished in 60.

32:52.215 --> 33:00.585
Then this became the responsibility administratively of ENIA, the National Institute of Agricultural Research.

33:01.966 --> 33:05.290
the young people who had been trained in the Rockefeller program.

33:05.470 --> 33:06.011
Do you follow?

33:08.453 --> 33:16.823
And today, we continue to work there, even up until today.

33:17.344 --> 33:21.829
It's under their administrative direction now, but it's where we have our joint.

33:23.571 --> 33:27.976
The material is theirs, it's ours, it's everybody's.

33:29.137 --> 33:31.500
And let me just say this.

33:32.813 --> 33:49.197
It, since 1960, has probably had greater influence on wheat research and production than any other research center in the world.

33:49.217 --> 33:57.910
Thousands, probably something on the order of 1,200 young wheat scientists have spent six months

33:58.666 --> 34:10.343
there at least, and many hundreds of senior wheat scientists from around the world, including the US, Canada, Australia, Western European countries.

34:10.684 --> 34:14.389
All came out of this little struggle.

34:15.291 --> 34:19.437
And Don Rodolfo, once he was convinced, was the guiding hand on all of this.

34:19.978 --> 34:22.261
And not only the guiding hand, I mean, he was out there.

34:22.281 --> 34:28.150
He knew how to operate with political leaders in all levels.

34:30.408 --> 34:34.975
Well, we've got a lot of things to talk about that, but I don't want to talk about that right now.

34:35.135 --> 34:35.776
I want to go back.

34:35.816 --> 34:53.582
The first thing I want to do is a question that I wanted to ask that deals with the first few years that you were at Obergon, and that is you're dealing not just with agriculture here.

34:54.263 --> 34:58.609
You're dealing primarily with agriculture, but you're also dealing with people.

34:59.146 --> 35:04.091
and you're trying to change the behavior of people to become more productive.

35:06.313 --> 35:12.720
Did you feel at that time or do you feel since that you were sort of a social engineer?

35:14.142 --> 35:18.026
I think I was pretty well aware of this from the early beginnings.

35:18.046 --> 35:28.056
I may not have called it by that name, but I realized that change is like a snowball.

35:28.525 --> 35:38.197
Once you get it going, it moves by gravity and it speeds up and it spreads in more than one direction.

35:38.437 --> 35:43.243
That ball grows in all dimensions.

35:44.745 --> 35:55.798
I think I was fairly aware of this from the beginning, probably because of my ideas of change that I'd seen as a

35:55.897 --> 36:03.849
young boy on the farm and through the vocational agriculture, the Smith Hughes agriculture program I stayed in and studied in in high school.

36:04.470 --> 36:07.215
I think that we were very fortunate.

36:07.355 --> 36:20.115
I had an agriculture teacher in high school who was recently graduated from, as a matter of fact, his first year out of Iowa State University.

36:20.602 --> 36:27.011
This is a vocational agriculture teacher, and he was an innovative sort of individual.

36:27.031 --> 36:42.651
We conducted on farms, the first fertilizer test in the county, probably, where it was combined with the hybrid variety and fertilizer on farm.

36:42.671 --> 36:45.495
Obviously, we could only have one test.

36:45.830 --> 36:48.292
because it was done as part of the classwork.

36:48.312 --> 36:50.134
We couldn't be goofing off too much.

36:51.034 --> 36:53.276
So is this in the 1930s, the early 30s?

36:53.296 --> 36:53.516
Yes.

36:54.637 --> 36:55.938
In the late 20s.

36:56.139 --> 36:56.619
Late 20s.

36:56.719 --> 36:56.999
Late 20s.

36:57.760 --> 36:58.681
Probably in 28.

36:59.982 --> 37:05.486
And so I was aware of some of these things.

37:06.187 --> 37:10.791
That school had not yet established its future farmers chapter.

37:10.951 --> 37:15.735
The year after I graduated in 32, that came into being through this same professor.

37:16.137 --> 37:21.330
That same teacher spent his whole career there, and he died tragically.

37:21.932 --> 37:33.201
He and the principal and two other biology teachers, when they went up to Minnesota, his name was Harry Schroeder, and went on a fishing expedition early in the spring,

37:33.974 --> 37:39.180
And they were there and they'd been fishing apparently for the first day they'd come in at noon.

37:39.661 --> 37:46.348
From what they found later, pretty good catch of fish and they must have been a little tired and they laid down on the bed and lit the fire because it was cold.

37:47.330 --> 37:49.272
And there was a wasp nest in the chimney.

37:50.533 --> 37:54.958
They all died from carbon monoxide.

37:57.181 --> 38:03.188
But you, in other words, as early as the 1920s, you were aware of the impact of technology.

38:03.607 --> 38:04.008
Yes.

38:04.789 --> 38:07.432
On behavior.

38:08.694 --> 38:11.217
I think I was sensitive to this at a pretty early age.

38:12.339 --> 38:12.439
Yeah.

38:12.459 --> 38:13.400
And it's grown on me.

38:13.420 --> 38:16.765
And I think that through agriculture, you can reach people better.

38:16.805 --> 38:24.635
The world's poor, the ones that need it most, because they're mostly farmers, subsistence farmers.

38:25.216 --> 38:28.320
These in Sonora weren't necessarily subsistence.

38:28.400 --> 38:28.580
No.

38:30.182 --> 38:32.145
But there were subsistence farmers there.

38:32.480 --> 38:40.210
In central Mexico, many of them were subsistence because this was land that had all been fragmented, but they changed the same way.

38:41.732 --> 38:51.143
The thing in Sonora with the Hedo farmers, the Hedo was the land that was given where you don't own the land, you have the use of it.

38:52.665 --> 38:58.993
And it was part of the new constitution following the revolution.

38:59.362 --> 39:14.756
They were going to make sure by this article that never could this land be put back under these aristocratic ownerships like the or the church.

39:15.657 --> 39:25.365
And their way of doing it was not to give them title to the land, the , but the use of the land as long as they farmed it and produced.

39:26.386 --> 39:28.508
Of course, that last clause,

39:28.707 --> 39:37.638
produced is a trip hammer because when you don't own something, you don't really put your heart and your life investment into it.

39:37.658 --> 39:39.179
So that's been a booby trap.

39:39.980 --> 39:41.202
But the intent was good.

39:41.983 --> 39:44.225
The result was not so good.

39:44.245 --> 39:53.536
And originally we had the field day for both together.

39:54.698 --> 39:57.381
But then there was

39:58.373 --> 40:19.384
attempt made later at the suggestion of some of the leaders of the Hedo, that maybe it'd be better if we had separate field days, so that these collective farmers who had less education generally, where you could spend a little more time and explain in a little more detail.

40:19.404 --> 40:24.170
This was done, I think, for a short period of time, but it's been put back together again now.

40:24.190 --> 40:25.933
Well, I think the education

40:26.740 --> 40:40.805
of the hedal farmer has changed very greatly in the last 10 or 15 years, and that's probably why, and they should be kept together.

40:40.825 --> 40:50.402
We were talking before about some of the problems that you had when you first got down, the first four years or five years of Mexico, and we talked about

40:56.170 --> 40:58.694
arrangements, which would seem primitive to me.

40:59.956 --> 41:02.219
What about the problems with the language?

41:02.239 --> 41:03.862
You didn't speak Spanish.

41:03.882 --> 41:04.783
I didn't speak a word.

41:05.164 --> 41:12.254
I still remember the first word, first time I said buenos dias, and how embarrassed I was.

41:13.336 --> 41:21.428
To our head accountant who just retired from, he was then the head accountant for Rockefeller Foundation.

41:22.770 --> 41:24.473
He retired from

41:25.482 --> 41:26.823
three years ago.

41:31.248 --> 41:33.390
Tell me about Spanish.

41:33.650 --> 41:34.291
You had to learn.

41:34.651 --> 41:35.312
You had to learn.

41:35.672 --> 41:38.755
The ones who didn't, didn't stay long.

41:39.375 --> 41:49.786
At that time, it was probably easier to learn Spanish than it is today for those who come to Simen, because at that time, there were very few, even of the young agronomists that spoke English.

41:51.387 --> 41:51.928
Very few.

41:52.408 --> 41:55.371
If they did, it was a few words.

41:55.756 --> 41:56.557
You had no choice.

41:57.598 --> 42:00.821
Either you went back and got out of the country or you learned.

42:03.384 --> 42:10.611
And I never took any classes until I had worked probably two years.

42:10.851 --> 42:14.975
Then I took from a very good teacher some personal private lessons.

42:16.317 --> 42:23.704
And I should have taken more.

42:24.190 --> 42:35.708
because my grammar, I mean, I have no problems, but if I want to speak about music and art, I need some fixing up.

42:35.728 --> 42:38.211
Still today.

42:38.292 --> 42:42.318
Because it's sort of an entirely different vocabulary.

42:42.338 --> 42:50.991
The vocabulary would be easy to master, but once you get to be fluent,

42:51.798 --> 42:59.269
When you've got a lot of other things that you want to do that seem more important, you don't continue to spend the time you should on a language.

42:59.309 --> 43:07.801
And as a matter of fact, if I were to spend more time on the language now, I would like to spend more time on Portuguese.

43:09.323 --> 43:09.864
Well, for Brazil.

43:09.884 --> 43:15.952
And it's hopeless over in India and Pakistan with all those languages.

43:16.013 --> 43:20.539
You better just not waste your time on trying to master those.

43:21.245 --> 43:27.471
I would like to know Arabic, but it's too late in life for me to waste time on that.

43:27.491 --> 43:33.877
I have another question, and this goes back to the Rockefeller Foundation and more of the early years.

43:34.738 --> 43:50.593
Here we have the United States and Canada as two major wheat producing countries in the world, and we have already a strong foundation and even a tradition in agricultural experimentation, research, yet

43:50.894 --> 44:09.423
The Rockefeller Foundation decides to establish a center, which became one of the greatest centers, a center for wheat research in an area which we generally call the Third World.

44:10.225 --> 44:11.687
Why did the Rockefeller Foundation

44:12.359 --> 44:13.961
you know, and which was also poor.

44:14.001 --> 44:23.892
Why didn't the Rockefeller Foundation establish some sort of a research institution in some place in the United States?

44:24.853 --> 44:34.585
Well, you see, the research institution as it evolved was a byproduct of this attempt to produce more, help Mexico produce more food.

44:35.305 --> 44:37.948
And these other things spun off this.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.791
This wasn't the original plan at all.

44:40.572 --> 44:41.893
It was to try to see

44:42.650 --> 44:51.579
They had been working in this international health programs for 25 years, from 1914 till 1940, whatever that is.

44:52.740 --> 44:55.503
It's more than 25, isn't it?

44:55.543 --> 44:56.044
26 years.

44:57.225 --> 45:02.270
And among the things that it has spun off since we just mentioned China was the Peking Medical School.

45:02.710 --> 45:07.956
But it had established some centers of excellence, if you want to call them.

45:07.996 --> 45:12.100
They weren't the same excellence as today, but trying to get

45:12.282 --> 45:39.353
people trained in medicine and public health elsewhere, and then sent out some good MDs, knowledgeable on vector-borne diseases, malaria, and especially on yellow fever, and medical entomologists knew the vectors, and sanitation engineers to fix up water and health conditions.

45:40.497 --> 45:59.250
They had recognized, and so when Wallace called them about this possibility, or when he talked to Fosdick, they recognized that when infant mortality dropped, you got more mouths to feed, and since the food production was static, they were going from bad to worse.

45:59.270 --> 46:01.374
And that's why they started this.

46:01.394 --> 46:03.838
But once the ball started moving,

46:05.101 --> 46:11.530
to have moved it back here would have been to have choked it because we were completely free.

46:12.712 --> 46:15.797
We didn't have fixed ideas of what needed to be done.

46:16.117 --> 46:22.707
I've told you about the photo period in sensitivity, the way we bred the weeds, we moved them, it was unorthodox.

46:24.610 --> 46:26.933
Much later we found how flexible they were.

46:27.754 --> 46:30.699
Our ideas of training young scientists was very different.

46:32.001 --> 46:33.623
When the original program

46:34.733 --> 46:35.454
was finished.

46:38.258 --> 46:56.023
And when we were transferring the responsibility in 1960 to INYA, the National Institute of Agricultural Research, and we were working there, about six of us, still working hand in glove, FAO asked me to look at the programs on wheat from Morocco to India.

46:56.203 --> 46:57.805
And that's where I saw that in
