WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:18.337
As

00:02.242 --> 00:18.337
I recall, Gine Hall, a Greek type of building with 
columns in front, and they had plays and musicals

00:02.242 --> 00:18.337
and so forth there. And I would go to the 
entertainment there to Gine Hall. Did Aggies make

00:22.861 --> 00:25.223
noise in Gine sometimes? Yes, I'm sure they did. 
I'm sure they did. So you're going home from your

00:30.693 --> 00:34.842
freshman year feeling good. Right. What did you do 
that summer? That summer, I wanted to get

00:38.168 --> 00:57.385
experience in the oil field, so I went to Mr. 
McGowan and I said, I want to get a job to get some

00:38.168 --> 00:57.385
experience in the oil and gas industry. So he sent 
me to a compressor station they had at Latex,

00:58.206 --> 01:08.175
Texas.

01:08.155 --> 01:20.653
My first job was as an

01:08.155 --> 01:20.653
assistant in a machine shop. I cleaned up stuff.

01:26.983 --> 01:32.551
I remember the guy who ran the lathe and so forth. I 
tried to learn things from him, but it was a dirty

01:32.591 --> 01:36.897
job. very dirty job, but I wanted to be as macho as I 
could be. I remember Mr. McGahn had a daughter who

01:42.721 --> 01:52.376
was a good friend of the girl I had gone with in Byrd 
High School. They came out to see me at three

01:53.397 --> 01:59.847
o'clock one afternoon, and I was so embarrassed 
that these girls would come out there and destroy

02:00.350 --> 02:05.378
my macho image. And then at the last of the summer, 
though, I played tennis at Texas A&M, and I had

02:07.281 --> 02:21.042
aspirations to be a I went to tennis tournaments 
for the last part of the summer,

02:21.022 --> 02:36.250
but I had gotten in some experience in the 
compressive station. So you come back in the fall

02:36.270 --> 02:39.455
of 34 as a sophomore. Right. How was life better for 
a sophomore? Oh, it was much better. You didn't run

02:43.399 --> 02:44.520
errands. You had the fish to run errands for you. 
You

02:48.045 --> 02:53.613
had a certain amount of status. You knew the ropes, 
and you had made friends. Anyway,

02:59.782 --> 03:10.097
as opposed to your freshman year when everything 
was so uncertain about whether you could survive

03:10.600 --> 03:15.387
or not, why, here you are in control. Did you use a 
paddle? Oh yes, oh yes, yes. Where did you get your

03:19.794 --> 03:21.837
paddle? I think, actually, Hudson and I shared it. 
I think Hudson brought it from Shreveport, and we

03:28.788 --> 03:35.879
shared his paddle, isn't that right? Still didn't 
have a car? No, still had no car. And what was your

03:39.035 --> 03:42.962
task in your outfit as a sophomore? Did you have 
any? As a sophomore, I was a corporal, and

03:44.305 --> 03:59.372
we actually were in charge of the But I went out for 
cross country my sophomore year under Colonel

03:59.740 --> 04:03.004
Anderson. And that took a lot of time, and then 
played basketball under Coach Reed. And then I

04:09.712 --> 04:16.479
played tennis under Coach, under J.P. Abbott. And 
then the classes became more interesting,

04:16.499 --> 04:25.630
geology and

04:25.610 --> 04:33.878
And I really enjoyed the English classes under, 
and that's when I won the sophomore writing

04:25.610 --> 04:33.878
contest. Was that under Dr. Abbott? Was he your 
English? He was my English prof, but actually the

04:37.923 --> 04:47.993
ones that decided it was a three-man panel, I 
think, that decided who won the $25. Geology, who

04:48.734 --> 04:50.115
were some? faculty members that were? Let me see.

04:56.576 --> 05:07.427
I remember, Torium Engineering, Harold Vance was 
the, and he had a lot of influence on not only me, but

04:56.576 --> 05:07.427
a lot of people. And Vance was head of the Torium 
Engineering Department. And he taught as much

05:18.614 --> 05:21.277
philosophy as anything. And people, outstanding 
people like Bum Bright and so forth, have

05:21.858 --> 05:31.891
really... Have you talked to Bum, incidentally? 
He's worth talking to. He'll tell you about his

05:35.255 --> 05:37.618
experience with Vance. But Vance made a... I mean, 
his philosophy about life and so forth, had more

05:45.108 --> 05:49.156
effect than really your classes. But he was a 
graduate of Stanford.

05:54.527 --> 05:59.758
But A&M's Pretoria Engineering School has always 
been tops in the country. When you got into the real

06:00.464 --> 06:07.159
world of petroleum engineering, did you find that 
A&M had prepared you well? Oh yes, I sure did. I

06:09.063 --> 06:17.241
thought The combination of A&M and MIT, I was glad I 
went to MIT. MIT, it was a different culture, of

06:21.510 --> 06:33.154
course,

06:21.510 --> 06:33.154
but A&M, had the reputation which with me stuck in 
that you had a good basic knowledge of physics, of

06:33.134 --> 06:54.670
math, and so and also the ability to get along with 
other men that and I found out that various

06:54.650 --> 07:11.718
companies that A&M's reputation was that people 
had a good basic educational foundation and they

06:54.650 --> 07:11.718
didn't mind getting their hands dirty and they got 
along well with other guys. I've heard from

07:13.501 --> 07:19.932
others, wonder if you agree with this, A&M has 
always been strong in the real and And schools like

07:20.570 --> 07:23.214
MIT in the theoretical. Exactly, that's 
absolutely true. You found that to be true? Oh

07:26.219 --> 07:27.622
yeah, that's absolutely true. Was there 
anything, when you got into the real world

07:28.764 --> 07:36.617
petroleum industry, was there anything that A&M 
had overlooked?

07:38.660 --> 07:42.747
I'd say the

07:45.072 --> 07:48.436
It was something that, educational-wise, I don't 
think so. I think A&M had prepared you for the real

07:48.496 --> 07:56.566
world pretty good. During your four years at A&M, 
describe the student body in general. Where did

08:03.153 --> 08:04.535
they come from? What kinds of families? 
Background? Money or lack of money? I'd say for the

08:11.127 --> 08:16.672
most, the students at A&M were people who really 
wanted to get an education. That was the

08:16.692 --> 08:19.815
controlling thing. Some came from moneyed 
families, but most of them didn't. I'd say

08:24.879 --> 08:41.134
certainly more than half of them worked in the mess 
hall or did other things.

08:41.114 --> 08:48.082
But the common denominator was that these people 
wanted an education. And one of the people in my

08:48.282 --> 08:54.889
class was a guy named Anderson, I remember. He 
actually came, he hoboed into College Station on a

08:55.370 --> 09:05.401
freight train, but he had some sort of a federal 
assistance program he was on. And this guy later

09:05.981 --> 09:08.404
ended up working on the atomic bomb in Alamogarda. 
Here's a guy who comes in on a freight train. But the

09:14.166 --> 09:17.250
student body itself was...

09:23.056 --> 09:33.328
I'd say the difference in A&M and most other 
schools was the

09:23.056 --> 09:33.328
fact that the The principal purpose for their 
being there was to get an education as opposed to

09:33.545 --> 09:48.669
Texas, which let's say a lot of people go to Texas 
for their social life, at least at that time

09:33.545 --> 09:48.669
compared to A&M. Were there kids from, most Aggies 
from small towns or rural or from the cities? Small

09:55.500 --> 09:57.342
towns or rural mostly. As I recall, somebody from 
Highland Park was sort of an oddity, for instance.

10:06.087 --> 10:10.512
Did y'all ever tease anybody about their being 
broke and not having any money? No, because most

10:12.695 --> 10:15.758
people were broke themselves.

10:18.882 --> 10:24.088
Did it matter whether you were a Catholic or a 
Baptist or a Jew? Well, no, I think that's one of the

10:24.608 --> 10:32.759
things about A&M is that a person was accepted for 
what he was. And I think you respected other

10:33.460 --> 10:38.187
people's faiths. They had various organizations 
like the Hillel Club and the Catholic Clubs and so

10:38.247 --> 10:48.541
forth. And people, their faiths were never were 
never even questioned, as I recall. And a guy who,

10:56.854 --> 11:13.263
and let's say when people elected class officers 
or something, it wasn't some moneyed guy, it was

10:56.854 --> 11:13.263
how he was viewed by his peers. Did you all have 
religious emphasis weak then? I'm not sure we did,

11:19.317 --> 11:27.386
the religious week as such, except that we... Did 
you participate in any Sunday activities? Oh,

11:27.406 --> 11:28.347
yes, yes. I was a, my, I was, earlier was a 
Methodist, my mother was a Methodist, but then I

11:28.487 --> 11:46.087
joined the Presbyterian Church, and so I used to go 
to services there, the Presbyterian services.

11:46.107 --> 11:48.109
And where were they held? I think in Bryan at that 
time, I'm not sure. But I remember I used to go to the

11:52.073 --> 11:54.616
services. We got there just as the new church in 
Bryan was opening. Is that right? The old one

11:59.641 --> 12:01.302
downtown was still there. Is that right? And I 
saved one of the pews that was in the truck to be

12:02.924 --> 12:06.868
taken to the dump. Is that right? And then gave it 
back to them about four years ago. And I still have

12:10.812 --> 12:14.215
one of the... light fixtures. Is that right? That 
was also in the tribe. Is that right? Now Colonel

12:19.942 --> 12:22.968
Andy was a Presbyterian. Right. Were there any 
student church related groups that met on campus?

12:31.441 --> 12:34.444
Yeah, I think there were. I think there were. I 
think certainly the

12:36.126 --> 12:46.316
Jewish boys, I think, met on campus. I'm not sure 
about the Catholics, but I think the Protestants

12:46.356 --> 12:56.567
went into Brine, but I'm not sure about that. Now, 
at Northgate, what churches were already there?

13:01.985 --> 13:04.549
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Were there any Hispanic 
students? Mexican-American? Oh, yes. Yes. There

13:14.185 --> 13:20.315
were a number of Hispanic students. Nothing like 
now, but there were a number of Hispanic students.

13:23.881 --> 13:24.602
How were they treated? Just like anybody else. 
What you were, you know. Were there any

13:28.850 --> 13:32.174
international students in your years? Some, but 
they were quite few, the international. But I

13:39.563 --> 13:50.757
remember in my class, Eddie Longoria was a 
classmate of mine, and his family was big in

13:39.563 --> 13:50.757
banking in Mexico.

13:51.547 --> 13:57.034
And I remember a guy named Josephi was in my class, 
and his family had a ranch in Mexico. And Eddie was a

13:58.075 --> 14:04.863
quarter mile on the track team, Eddie LaGoria. But 
anybody was regarded on what he was, what he did.

14:14.255 --> 14:17.839
Now, the Depression was hitting everybody hard. 
Right. Had the project houses started? while you

14:21.500 --> 14:22.301
were there? Those at the south of Kyle Field where 
the country boys lived? I don't think so. I don't

14:29.349 --> 14:30.170
think so. I think, as I recall, everybody lived in 
the different halls, you know, at Hart Hall and

14:30.271 --> 14:40.723
Purr Year and so forth. Now south of Hart Hall And 
where the MSC is now, there are lots of faculty and

14:43.960 --> 14:48.444
staff houses. Right. Did you students ever go over 
in that area? Yes, as a matter of fact, I remember

14:53.468 --> 15:03.236
J.P. Abbott invited the tennis team for dinner at 
his place. Oh, describe that. Describe what a

15:04.737 --> 15:06.779
faculty house was like then. Well, it was a frame 
house, relatively small, J.P. Abbott was a

15:14.234 --> 15:19.740
graduate of Vanderbilt, and I think his wife was, 
too. Very charming southern people, very

15:20.341 --> 15:25.626
hospitable. And I remember we had dinner, and

15:26.487 --> 15:42.705
tablecloth, napkins, loved beautiful silver, 
and which You know, after eating in the mess hall

15:42.685 --> 15:46.710
was a real treat. But

15:47.191 --> 16:12.625
anyway, the faculty houses somewhat reminded me 
of when I visited my uncle in Fort Robinson,

15:47.191 --> 16:12.625
Nebraska, of the different houses of the 
captains, the majors, and so forth, all according

15:47.191 --> 16:12.625
to rank.

16:14.427 --> 16:18.815
The students never pulled any pranks over on a 
faculty or staff house? Not that I knew of. Not that

16:24.806 --> 16:26.028
I know of at all. When did you and your buddies 
discover there were steam tunnels on the campus?

16:33.422 --> 16:34.023
There were what? Steam tunnels. I don't think I 
ever did. Oh, really? No. Oh? No, I don't think I

16:38.337 --> 16:39.819
ever did. I never knew of it. They're big. These are 
about six by eight foot tunnels. Now, of course,

16:45.386 --> 16:48.130
they're all locked and screened off. But after 
World War II, that would be the way where you went

16:48.150 --> 16:52.876
from one door to another. Well, they weren't 
there. At least I never heard of them, as a matter of

16:54.098 --> 17:01.087
fact. The campus organizations that had the 
highest prestige I presume the Corps would be the

17:05.744 --> 17:07.967
first one. Of all of the student leadership 
positions on the campus, which one would have been

17:08.929 --> 17:15.799
the most respected? Would it be Corps Commander? 
Yes, the Corps Commander. And then maybe second

17:23.169 --> 17:29.318
the captain of the football team. But then in the 
military, after the Corps Commander, the most

17:35.174 --> 17:44.781
prestigious things were to be your CO of your 
company or your battery, your captain of your

17:35.174 --> 17:44.781
company or your battery. And those were highly 
competitive jobs or offices, let's say, that were

17:46.885 --> 18:01.703
decided after your experience at camp, which was 
your junior year. And then the military officers

18:02.443 --> 18:08.050
picked who would be captain of of each outfit. Were 
those people selected usually on a fair basis? Oh,

18:16.504 --> 18:17.426
yeah. Oh, yeah. Like I said, it was a very 
competitive thing.

18:25.327 --> 18:40.046
Actually,

18:25.327 --> 18:40.046
in my battery,

18:25.327 --> 18:40.046
the two of us really were competing to be captain of 
E Battery, Fred Silvey, and he and I ended up as

18:25.327 --> 18:40.046
roommates. I know that Fred wanted that position, 
but he took it in stride and he was on the staff How

18:53.947 --> 18:56.370
did you learn you had been selected? How did you get 
that information? As I recall, it was published.

19:02.078 --> 19:03.539
It was published. So nobody told you in advance? 
Nobody to know. It was published in orders. What

19:07.745 --> 19:11.990
did your outfit buddies do to you after that? 
After...

19:16.236 --> 19:18.739
Didn't they play some kind of joke on you or 
something? I don't remember, really, other than I

19:20.204 --> 19:31.210
think there were six of us who were officers in E 
Battery. I

19:32.152 --> 19:38.888
think all I did was congratulating me, that was 
all. They didn't drown you out that night? No, they

19:42.546 --> 19:43.908
didn't drown me out, no. Describe the duties of a 
company commander. What did you have to do during

19:47.476 --> 19:49.600
that year? A company commander actually looked 
after his

19:49.620 --> 19:58.979
entire unit. He was responsible for the welfare of 
everybody in his unit and of individual things,

20:00.856 --> 20:13.147
like he approved passes for them to go on the 
weekend. He kept up with their academics and that

20:14.969 --> 20:30.863
he saw that there was discipline in his outfit. in 
conference with the rest of the seniors, and the

20:30.843 --> 20:53.678
seniors really ran the school at that time, and in 
conference with other seniors established

20:30.843 --> 20:53.678
what the disciplines would be, and really sort of 
and sort of controlled hazing to a certain extent.

20:59.484 --> 21:12.656
But when Colonel Andy came in, Colonel Andy had 
decided to cut out the board, and I was not the only

20:59.484 --> 21:12.656
one affected. I think some others also got busted 
for a while and got reinstated.

21:24.303 --> 21:33.620
what were some of the fun things, contrast the high 
and low points of being a company commander? What

21:33.640 --> 21:35.005
were some of the joys and the But some of the joys was 
actually leading your battery, your company, in

21:35.845 --> 22:01.330
reviews and also in your court trips, your marches 
down the street.

22:01.310 --> 22:23.114
When

22:01.310 --> 22:23.114
you had special dances there where you invited 
your girlfriends down there while you were a big

22:01.310 --> 22:23.114
dog in the eyes of these gals.

22:23.394 --> 22:30.662
Trying to deal with those sophomores that had used 
the board was a tough task. What about some other

22:31.634 --> 22:33.918
tough task that you had to do.

22:37.024 --> 22:55.498
You actually

22:37.024 --> 22:55.498
carried out inspections of

22:37.024 --> 22:55.498
the different rooms and

22:56.238 --> 23:14.922
And the Commandant, of course, would carry out 
inspections on a monthly basis or so, but you

22:56.238 --> 23:14.922
yourself carried out inspections in the meantime 
to be sure that they were... And you saw that the

22:56.238 --> 23:14.922
orders were were followed that the commandant put 
out, as a matter of fact. And you were responsible

23:19.817 --> 23:26.125
for that, which you did through the first sergeant 
and so forth. But the chain of command was, I think,

23:26.646 --> 23:35.577
was one of the best educational things that I saw. 
What did you and your buddies think about the yell

23:36.130 --> 23:42.882
leaders, the singing cadets, the band? We 
respected and liked all of them. Like singing the

23:45.848 --> 23:48.032
cadets, we thought that was great. The band was 
held in very high respect and it was sort of special

23:48.312 --> 23:58.611
to be in the band.

23:59.030 --> 24:09.341
here at A&M without a music school that was able to

23:59.030 --> 24:09.341
put on a first class band. Excuse me, just let me 
call some guy. We were talking about

24:12.865 --> 24:18.551
organizations and so on. Yes. What did you and your 
buddies, what about the Yell Eaters? Was that a

24:24.398 --> 24:25.319
high prestige? Oh yeah, it was a very high prestige 
thing. Yeah, it was a very high prestige thing. And

24:32.848 --> 24:47.507
the guy,

24:32.848 --> 24:47.507
the Yale leader, I forget whether they were 
elected or not, but it was a high prestige. Were you

24:48.528 --> 24:52.694
aware that there were secret fraternities in 
existence at that time? Yeah, yeah. Which ones

24:55.477 --> 24:57.640
were there as far as you know? There was something 
called Stickers and one called,

24:58.092 --> 25:11.470
well, let's see, Stickers and... T.T.? T.T.s, 
T.T.s, right. As far as you were aware, which one

25:14.234 --> 25:17.518
had higher prestige? Well, the TTs were the... I'd 
say they had different statuses. The TTs were

25:32.062 --> 25:36.548
actually more social guys. The stickers were

25:38.271 --> 25:44.880
more the athletic people. And they had different, 
I'd

25:46.342 --> 26:01.663
say, different

25:46.342 --> 26:01.663
types of a

26:03.533 --> 26:04.554
Of reputation. Did the average student know there 
were secretaries? No, no. Okay. The, let's see,

26:11.882 --> 26:15.986
dates. How did you and your buddies get dates?

26:21.192 --> 26:28.039
Well, in the case of, one of the ways was with the 
CIA.

26:28.745 --> 26:44.166
When I was president of the sophomore class, I 
corresponded with the president of the sophomore

26:28.745 --> 26:44.166
class at CIA, and we set up a deal for the CIA girls to 
come down at a particular dance. And so that was one

26:44.186 --> 26:49.414
way. How were they treated at that dance? like 
Queens. They'd evacuate a building for them, a

26:54.100 --> 27:04.254
hall, they'd evacuate a hall for them, and they 
were treated like Queens. I mean, I've heard girls

27:04.454 --> 27:14.869
say, you've never really known popularity until 
you've gone to an A&M dance.

27:17.713 --> 27:21.398
Now, did you meet a special young lady while you 
were an undergraduate that you would later marry?

27:24.744 --> 27:26.026
No, no. I met, when I was a senior, I remember a girl 
named Lillian Street, and her brother was in my

27:26.186 --> 27:38.627
battery, as a matter of fact. And she was from San 
Antonio. She came up to the dances and so forth, the

27:42.070 --> 27:50.300
senior dances as my date. And she later married one 
of the guys in my outfit. What were the student

27:59.491 --> 28:02.355
indulgences then? What did people smoke and 
drink? A lot of people smoked. I never did. I was

28:11.074 --> 28:22.502
always out for some team, and you couldn't smoke, 
and I never wanted to.

28:23.461 --> 28:33.777
People drank a lot more hard liquor then than they 
now, as I understand it, kids drink beer mostly.

28:34.598 --> 28:47.038
But actually,

28:34.598 --> 28:47.038
people would, guys would pool their resources 
when they'd maybe buy a bottle of gin or something

28:34.598 --> 28:47.038
like that. Where did they buy it? Well, this was 
when they'd leave the campus. I mean, go to

28:57.282 --> 28:58.585
Houston. Was there a place out toward Snook? Was 
Whiskey Bridge? I think there was. I never did buy

29:06.627 --> 29:17.421
any liquor while I was at the campus, always 
Houston or Dallas or wherever. Did you ever have

29:17.561 --> 29:26.593
any problem when you were company commander with 
somebody in the outfit with liquor in their room or

29:17.561 --> 29:26.593
beer? I don't recall having any problem there. I 
don't. All right. People smoked cigarettes? Oh,

29:34.850 --> 29:35.551
yeah. Cigars? A lot of people smoked cigarettes 
and cigars. Pipe? Pipe and so forth. Chewing

29:41.497 --> 29:42.578
tobacco or snorting? Chewing tobacco, yes. As a 
matter of fact, I think the fish had, at the first

29:44.179 --> 29:52.648
baseball game, all had to chew tobacco. It made 
everybody sick. Most of them made everybody sick.

30:01.879 --> 30:06.805
Had you and your buddies ever heard of the words 
marijuana or heroin? No, never even heard of it at

30:07.285 --> 30:11.350
that time. It was a simpler era. Right. Who were the 
famous people, the celebrities on the campus

30:16.016 --> 30:20.301
then? Who was president when you got there? Dr. 
Walton. Describe him. Dr. T.O. Walton, a

30:27.604 --> 30:45.327
bald-headed guy who was

30:27.604 --> 30:45.327
in the, I forget at what time, the administration 
building I think had just been built, which is the

30:27.604 --> 30:45.327
column building. The new . Yeah, right, right.

30:50.678 --> 30:57.287
But Dr. Walton was looked on as almost

30:50.678 --> 30:57.287
untouchable. He was the

30:57.367 --> 31:04.557
big guru on the campus. But the deans were also, I'd

31:05.518 --> 31:14.651
say, looked on with a certain amount of awe and 
respect. Who was engineering? Dean Bolton was the

31:16.160 --> 31:27.130
dean of engineering, and he determined whether 
you were a distinguished student or not. The

31:27.891 --> 31:29.712
different deans of the colleges did. I remember 
Dean Brooks was the head of liberal arts

31:29.732 --> 31:46.167
by being roomy with Hudson Van Lone, who used to go 
see Dean Brooks about every two months. Thank you.
