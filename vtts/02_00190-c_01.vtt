WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:13.938
commodity group is the most skillful and which is 
perhaps the least skillful in maximizing their

00:02.140 --> 00:13.938
capability? Well, you know, I'm not really sure, 
but I'm guessing the cattlemen are probably as

00:15.580 --> 00:29.201
powerful as anybody in terms of getting pressure 
put on them. But then again, the cattlemen There's

00:30.743 --> 00:39.013
not that many government programs in cattle, but 
as far as if you want to muster some power, I would

00:30.743 --> 00:39.013
think the Cattlemen's Association would be. All 
right, but in marketing their product, are they

00:39.193 --> 00:42.076
skillful? Skillful. In getting about as well, 
doing about as well as the price could be? That's, I

00:48.544 --> 00:53.489
couldn't, you know, I can't separate out a group 
that's that skillful in marketing their product.

00:54.150 --> 00:56.633
Cooperatives, probably the dairy guys, might be 
because of just the nature of their product and the

00:57.338 --> 01:01.286
nature of their organization. The dairy people 
might be the better marketers. But didn't you tell

01:05.334 --> 01:20.022
me, wasn't it you or somebody else told me that the 
Vidalia onion people that have done much more

01:05.334 --> 01:20.022
skillfully the marketing of their onion than the 
Texans have of the 1015s. I'm not sure I told you

01:20.795 --> 01:24.820
that, but I presume Vidalia is maybe better known. 
That's what it's meaning. Yeah, it may have done a

01:25.801 --> 01:27.703
better. And that our crop, our product is probably 
as good or better. Yeah, the guys in the valley,

01:32.909 --> 01:42.080
bless their hearts, have not been, well, they're 
so independent. They're so individualistic that

01:42.100 --> 01:44.262
it's hard to get them to work together. And that's 
part of what we were doing down there in the early

01:44.923 --> 01:47.646
60s was trying to get them, Marketing orders were 
looked at as almost communistic. We don't want

01:50.264 --> 01:51.425
that. That's bad. That's communist. Almost. They 
were going to add the paper like that. So they

01:57.796 --> 02:00.420
haven't been, whereas California is just the 
opposite. California is known for marketing

02:00.440 --> 02:05.929
orders and cooperatives and Sunkist and Calcott 
and all that kind of thing. They've done, if you

02:06.409 --> 02:10.215
want to see how to market stuff historically, you 
went to California. The Texans were... You know,

02:12.483 --> 02:14.645
we don't want that stuff. We'll do it our way and 
suffered for it, I think. California, you know,

02:17.247 --> 02:21.571
Florida is not a good example of good marketing and 
the money they put into it. They put up the money to

02:21.591 --> 02:25.295
do it, orange juice and grapefruit and things like 
that. So as far as skillfully marketing their

02:26.135 --> 02:37.346
stuff, I don't know that, you know, somebody's 
probably shooting me but I'm trying to think of a

02:26.135 --> 02:37.346
group that I think is really good at that in Texas. 
It may be some of the grapefruit guys have their own

02:37.366 --> 02:41.089
associations. What about among those that have 
been least successful? Well, you know, you've got

02:47.519 --> 02:51.504
one side of the coin, there's the other. Marketing 
is where a lot of them have producers produce.

02:58.151 --> 02:58.732
That's what they want to do. They want to produce. 
And they assume that having produced, they're

03:00.233 --> 03:03.256
owed a fair price. And when they don't get it, they 
don't understand it. They don't want to put the

03:05.825 --> 03:09.331
time and effort into marketing or risk 
management. It's a tough education process

03:10.012 --> 03:14.860
because producing this stuff does take a lot of 
time and effort. And they just don't, many of them

03:15.621 --> 03:19.086
want to get into the marketing side of it. I think 
probably Plains Cotton Cooperative out in

03:20.228 --> 03:28.862
Lubbock has done some good work marketing their 
stuff, marketing their cotton. And I think you

03:29.888 --> 03:34.973
could probably go to maybe the Texas Grapefruit or 
Citrus Association in the Valley. They've done

03:35.293 --> 03:37.095
some good work. But agriculture by its nature, 
even though it's had government programs all

03:37.115 --> 03:44.643
these many years, is a bunch of damned independent 
people. They're hard to get to work together. In

03:46.625 --> 03:55.214
all of your marketing research, which was the most 
enjoyable, most pleasant, most fun? Well... I

03:58.238 --> 04:04.645
think working with the pecan people, their 
laid-back bunch, has been, was interesting. The

04:05.606 --> 04:14.956
honey people are, and I'm mostly, when I say 
marketing, I'm really more in the price analysis

04:05.606 --> 04:14.956
part of it, but the honey people are fun to work 
with. What little I've done with them just the last

04:15.057 --> 04:17.299
few years. But I can't really think of any that 
weren't interesting to try to figure out how they

04:18.220 --> 04:26.389
do this and why this happens and try to forecast the 
price. They've all, you know, it's a bunch of

04:27.010 --> 04:28.834
cases. And I can't think of the ones that scare me 
the most were in the valley where these guys didn't

04:29.716 --> 04:35.227
want you messing in their business. Of which, of 
all of those tasks, all your work, of which are you

04:35.909 --> 04:42.302
most proud? Well, trying to explain price 
behavior in something like pecans or a little bit

04:43.970 --> 05:01.528
in the honey thing and the citrus crops in the 
valley where you try to look at the market, see

04:43.970 --> 05:01.528
what's happening, imports, exports, stocks, 
whatever, and try to forecast the prices and see if

04:43.970 --> 05:01.528
you can actually explain why the price did what it 
did. Do you remember any specific examples of

05:02.129 --> 05:10.197
where suddenly a light came on and somebody jumped 
on board and agreed with you? Oh, yeah. I think that

05:13.053 --> 05:17.820
happens to some extent in pecans and some of the 
citrus work we did in the valley. And that's always

05:18.441 --> 05:25.651
reassuring that you see them understand what's 
happening, why this is happening to us. That's

05:25.851 --> 05:27.033
rewarding. Like when you see it in class, you know, 
when kids understand something that you're

05:27.053 --> 05:32.200
trying to teach, it's the same thing with adults. 
And they appreciate it because basically this

05:33.622 --> 05:39.711
whole economic side thing, like the beekeepers 
just don't, grasp what's going on. Does anybody

05:43.318 --> 05:49.986
ever write a note or pick up the phone or anything to 
say, hey, I really appreciate your work? Once in a

05:51.007 --> 05:52.108
while you get that. Once in a while. I think some get 
it more than others. But I have gotten letters,

05:54.270 --> 05:59.136
yeah, of appreciation for talks here and there or a 
publication. When they request your

05:59.857 --> 06:05.563
publications, you kind of get the feeling that 
they do appreciate what you're doing. Of all your

06:05.645 --> 06:10.473
publications, of which are you most proud? I 
suppose it could be some actually in trade

06:12.816 --> 06:19.347
publications, because I know they've been read by 
more people than a journal article. I suppose in

06:20.048 --> 06:27.079
terms of just selfish pride, the ones you've had in 
refereed journals are the ones that you think are

06:20.048 --> 06:27.079
the most prestigious. But when I get something in 
American Beekeeper or Pecan South or some trade

06:27.582 --> 06:40.556
publication, I feel as good about it because I know 
more people have read it and probably gotten more

06:27.582 --> 06:40.556
out of it than they did out of a journal article. But 
if somebody walked up to you today and said, give me

06:40.756 --> 06:46.983
two or three of your best, what would you have? I'd 
probably pick up the journal articles because

06:47.003 --> 06:51.448
they are refereed. Journal of Futures Market, 
there's a couple in there. A couple about what?

06:57.232 --> 07:01.275
about the futures market, risk management, 
futures and options contracts. I didn't really

07:02.376 --> 07:11.764
have that many, let's see, southern, most of my, I 
had one or two in agricultural, the mother

07:02.376 --> 07:11.764
journal. Most of my stuff was in regional journals 
or what did I just say, the future journal of

07:13.185 --> 07:20.552
futures markets. So I would probably pick those 
out and say this is, you know, grade D's. Do you have

07:24.415 --> 07:26.817
any research projects now that you will, Want to 
work on them? Well, I still do the pecan stuff, but

07:28.984 --> 07:33.229
all this is free. I mean, I'm not getting paid for 
it. I do it because I'm interested in it. And the

07:36.613 --> 07:37.775
same thing with the honey. They do pay for my hotel 
room, but I don't make any money off of honey or

07:38.395 --> 07:42.000
pecans. You're getting paid in satisfaction. 
Yeah, yeah, just the fun of doing it. I do get paid

07:46.445 --> 07:52.332
for going to Guatemala to teach, but it's not money 
that you couldn't do without. In your many

07:52.953 --> 08:05.355
extracurricular activities in these almost 40 
years, which extracurricular activities do you

07:52.953 --> 08:05.355
most proudly remember? You mean other than a trip 
to Europe? Is that an extracurricular activity?

08:10.504 --> 08:10.725
No, no, no. You mean on campus? Yeah. Yeah, well, I 
think working with the MSC. Wayne Stark was a force

08:15.464 --> 08:19.149
to be reckoned with on this campus. How did he 
identify you? Do you know? No, I don't. I'll bet it

08:24.395 --> 08:25.697
was through Ty Timm. I'm guessing. That's the way 
he did because he contacted me one time about

08:27.359 --> 08:32.325
somebody on our faculty. I'm guessing through Ty, 
but I don't know. And what was your role with the

08:34.328 --> 08:36.631
MSU? I was on the council, and so was Peggy. And so we 
met those kids and worked with Skona, some, as well

08:39.735 --> 08:44.661
as being on the council. And I remember one time we 
took a trip to Houston with him, took the

08:45.518 --> 08:52.584
educational trip, you know, this is your fork, 
this is your knife, and that sort of thing. And he

08:52.784 --> 08:57.448
did a really good, and sending kids to Harvard and 
places like that. So that was a good experience for

08:58.069 --> 08:59.830
me when I first got here. Other than that, I 
haven't, when President Vandenberg got here, he

09:01.051 --> 09:07.176
did an interesting thing. He initiated the 
Faculty Senate, which lo and behold these many

09:07.296 --> 09:15.323
years was not welcomed on the Texas A&M campus. I 
got appointed to that committee, which met about a

09:15.961 --> 09:21.628
year, and came up with a faculty senate, which I 
think is a good idea. It's more of an advisory

09:21.668 --> 09:27.676
institution, but I thought that was a needed. In 
this day and age, I think Texas A&M needs a faculty

09:28.397 --> 09:31.501
senate. And I think it's pretty well behaved 
itself. I think it's been beneficial. I worked

09:36.262 --> 09:39.245
some with, what do you call these 10-year studies? 
Southern Association Accreditation. Yeah, I've

09:42.428 --> 09:45.551
been on a couple of those, and those were 
interesting. It gives you some perspective on the

09:45.731 --> 09:59.043
institution, but I know there's been stuff other 
than that, too, but like I said, I was never a core

09:45.731 --> 09:59.043
advisor

09:45.731 --> 09:59.043
to that group. I was on Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society 
for a number of years, up through the ranks,

09:59.083 --> 10:06.150
working with honor students, and that was... A 
good experience for me. And working with the

10:10.001 --> 10:19.354
graduate students, that's not extracurricular, 
but just seeing them come through here, a

10:10.001 --> 10:19.354
tremendous mix. And from all over the country, 
they came. Much more heterogeneous group than the

10:21.997 --> 10:25.101
undergraduates. Of all the people that you have 
known here at A&M, to whom would you feel deepest

10:26.082 --> 10:33.852
gratitude? Gratitude? For whatever. You mean 
like in a professional sense? People that you're

10:40.708 --> 10:45.555
grateful for what they did, what they meant to you 
and to A&M? Well, shoot, Haskell, I could have

10:46.936 --> 10:48.338
mentioned you. But I'm going to bring it closer to 
home, I guess. Well, as I said before, I've

10:53.926 --> 10:59.733
suffered by not seeking enough advice, I think, 
during my life from whoever. But, you know, Ty

11:01.015 --> 11:03.719
hired me, so of course I'll be holding to him. John 
Hopkins... I think, was supportive. I think John

11:08.257 --> 11:09.239
was fair. I'm not sure I always did as much as I 
should for the department, but I suppose

11:10.260 --> 11:27.281
Bob Branson, Bob's been a supporter, so I credit 
Bob with putting up with me and being helpful. I

11:29.284 --> 11:35.672
don't know, there's so many people it's hard to 
really make that, you know, answer that question

11:29.284 --> 11:35.672
and say, well, this is the guy that because there 
was no really mentor as such that I went to a lot and

11:36.513 --> 11:49.998
said, tell me what to do here, tell me what to do 
here, although I probably should have, but I

11:36.513 --> 11:49.998
didn't.

11:50.820 --> 11:51.721
Okay.

11:54.206 --> 11:55.568
What were your avocations? What did you do for fun? 
For fun? To relax. In the early years, there used to

12:00.948 --> 12:09.399
be some guys in the department who played golf, but 
we always felt a little guilty about that because

12:00.948 --> 12:09.399
you weren't supposed to be off during business 
hours. So I think some took leave and some didn't.

12:12.543 --> 12:14.986
But that didn't go on many years. I like to play 
handball. We play handball at 5 o'clock, maybe

12:18.230 --> 12:24.238
twice a week with Art Gerloh. who Art passed away a 
couple, three years ago. Spell his last name.

12:28.591 --> 12:30.873
G-E-R-L-O-W, Art Gerlo. He was a Scandinavian 
Cajun from South Louisiana.

12:38.339 --> 12:40.561
Played, you know, some tennis. Bicycling. Did you 
play handball with just him, just Art? Well, Art,

12:44.785 --> 12:52.831
the handball players now, Stan Lowy was a handball 
player. Stan Steven, who you know, was a banker. A

12:55.707 --> 12:57.390
lot of graduate students. We played handball with 
graduate students a lot over there in DeWare. It

13:01.619 --> 13:03.402
was the better place to play. Other applications? 
Yeah, bicycling. I did a little bit of bicycling

13:09.294 --> 13:11.599
here, there, and yonder. We'd go to rides. And then 
now it's racquetball. with the

13:16.514 --> 13:26.751
McCandless and Buck Henderson and people of that 
stripe. But other than that, camping. We liked to

13:30.316 --> 13:31.038
camp. That's how we used to go to meetings. The 
meetings of the Agricultural Economic

13:32.159 --> 13:35.725
Association used to be held universally. So you 
got to go to Washington State or Calgary, Canada,

13:44.375 --> 13:49.061
Oklahoma State, or wherever they were, Kentucky, 
Montana, Wyoming. And you took your kids and you

13:49.081 --> 13:51.084
went camping. That's what we did. That was a lot of 
fun. A certain era in your life, you do that.

13:57.673 --> 14:00.317
Otherwise, the church. We teach Sunday school 
below these many years. Consider that an

14:04.322 --> 14:08.749
avocation, but it's an activity that takes a lot of 
your time, as you know. As

14:14.227 --> 14:20.817
If you could give advice now to your department, 
what advice would you give it? That's one of those

14:20.877 --> 14:24.142
thought questions. I

14:24.202 --> 14:42.310
guess I would advise it to spend a lot of time trying 
to figure out what are the significant problems in

14:24.202 --> 14:42.310
society, economically related problems, that we 
should be working on. Not that you're going to

14:43.505 --> 14:53.096
force people into niches to do their work, but I've 
always wondered if we spent enough time simply got

14:43.505 --> 14:53.096
research money. We used to have more than we have 
now. If we're really working on significant

14:55.780 --> 15:02.588
problems, it's bothered me that we tend to go where 
the money is as opposed to where the problems are.

15:03.709 --> 15:06.913
And people with a lot of money don't always have the 
worst problems. It always kind of bothered me, and

15:07.670 --> 15:16.860
I certainly wasn't going to do it, that we didn't do 
more work in agricultural labor, farm workers,

15:07.670 --> 15:16.860
welfare, and things like that in Texas. But it just 
wasn't politically popular. You really

15:18.942 --> 15:19.983
couldn't. We had a guy who tried to do it, and it was 
not feasible to do much in that area. So I think, as

15:25.349 --> 15:34.439
researchers, to look at the problems that are 
significant as far as teaching goes, that's a good

15:25.349 --> 15:34.439
question. We're getting now into distance 
education and stuff like that. Any

15:38.163 --> 15:45.194
areas of emphasis or disemphasis? Well, I would 
like, I wish that our graduates, and I'm not saying

15:46.036 --> 15:54.890
that I did, but I wish they had a broader education. 
I'm not saying we're vo-tech, but I'm saying we're

15:55.471 --> 16:03.023
pretty, it's a question of are we meeting the job 
market, as opposed to, And we don't need to turn out

16:04.066 --> 16:11.395
liberal arts majors, but I think that we suffer 
from too narrow an orientation in our department.

16:11.415 --> 16:14.719
And I wish they had, we don't even teach history of 
economic thought anymore. Kids used to take, at

16:14.739 --> 16:20.305
least at the graduate level, we had a course on 
economics called history of economic thought.

16:20.325 --> 16:25.972
And you went back and you looked at all the way up 
from Plato to Marshall and Marx and all these guys.

16:26.292 --> 16:27.353
They don't get that now. What they get is 
quantitative knowledge. And I think we come glued

16:30.577 --> 16:33.060
to the computer. numbers and econometric models, 
math, stat, that sort of thing. I don't think

16:38.496 --> 16:46.085
that's given us a less rich life than if we had 
looked at where did we come from, how did we get

16:38.496 --> 16:46.085
here, what is political science, what is 
political economy? And, you know, they should

16:47.126 --> 16:50.750
know who those are, who the big names in the field 
were, what they stood for. Who was Keynes? I think a

16:52.212 --> 16:53.714
lot of these kids know who Keynes was. So I think 
we've missed a little bit there by not giving a

16:54.715 --> 17:00.321
little more rounded education. So I would argue 
for that.

17:04.343 --> 17:05.425
What have we not covered? What have we not covered? 
Yeah, what have we left out that you thought I was

17:06.927 --> 17:08.889
going to say? Where do I want to be 10 years from now? 
Alive.

17:14.558 --> 17:28.077
Oh, well, we've made lots of good friends here and 
the collegiality of meeting people in other

17:14.558 --> 17:28.077
departments and, you know, it's amazing the 
contact we've had with historians and blessed by

17:14.558 --> 17:28.077
that. And it's a great community. We have raised 
our kids here. Our kids, when we came here, As our

17:32.525 --> 17:34.709
kids grew up, they had the run of the campus. They 
could go to G Raleigh and play. They could swim in

17:35.991 --> 17:36.852
the pool. It was just like a little town situation, 
and now all that's changed. The kids of faculty

17:42.321 --> 17:47.090
today don't have that privilege, and I'm sorry 
they don't, but they can't. There's no way that

17:47.410 --> 17:50.635
would work today, but you know how it was in those 
days. It was beautiful. They rode their bikes

17:52.198 --> 17:55.123
everywhere and did what they wanted to. As you, 
that caused me to ask a question I haven't asked

17:56.757 --> 18:01.002
anybody else. As you think back, could we, could 
A&M have done a much better job of integrating the

18:01.022 --> 18:08.890
student body racially?

18:11.794 --> 18:15.798
Could it have been done more skillfully, 
smoothly, with fewer problems? I don't know, you

18:17.880 --> 18:24.047
know, I'm so, I guess, numb to that, that I never 
really felt, I know there was problems with kids. I

18:27.647 --> 18:32.754
had an Indian student who got harassed over here 
last year, two years ago, because of his race. But

18:33.616 --> 18:37.861
I've never, I always felt the problem was more with 
females than it was with racial. The racial thing

18:38.642 --> 18:42.287
was not a big deal on this campus. It probably was, 
but I didn't feel it. I really didn't.

18:51.280 --> 18:54.304
And I don't know how the female could have been 
handled better No, but it was handled, and the

18:54.706 --> 18:59.734
people, the way they reacted, you can't think 
about that. It was going to happen, and I think it

18:59.754 --> 19:04.682
needed to happen. All right, I've got three more 
questions here. Of what are you most proud? Of what

19:11.473 --> 19:12.354
am I most proud? We're talking about 
professionally. Well, I think the students that

19:15.119 --> 19:22.350
we've helped go through here, the graduate 
students, I've had more to do with them. And

19:23.005 --> 19:25.008
teaching. You never know what buttons you've 
touched. But you have your moments, as you know,

19:27.250 --> 19:35.581
when lights have gone on and, in some cases, 
lifelong friendships from even undergraduates.

19:37.143 --> 19:41.248
But the grad students I've worked with and we still 
keep in touch with, the research is important. I

19:41.329 --> 19:42.410
think that's been helpful. But I think there's no 
substitute for the people you've worked with as

19:43.131 --> 19:46.755
they came through here. So I would say that the work 
we've done with that. The students have been the

19:51.445 --> 19:53.468
most rewarding. Can you think of some specific 
moments as samples of those good times?

20:01.377 --> 20:04.141
When this happened or somebody did this or said 
that? Well, as you've seen them go out and become

20:05.403 --> 20:15.775
professors or department heads or something like 
that, but nothing really flashes up that strikes

20:05.403 --> 20:15.775
me. I'm sure I could think of it if I sat here long 
enough. but just in general, that they've been

20:18.473 --> 20:20.937
successful. Getting them in here sometimes was a 
problem. Let's make believe someone walks up to

20:28.568 --> 20:34.557
you and gives you a check for a million dollars with 
one condition. You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but

20:35.478 --> 20:42.509
you get to decide how they will use that money. You 
can make a big gift, and you select the purpose.

20:46.335 --> 20:47.316
What would it be for?

20:50.165 --> 21:05.025
I don't know if it's legal, but

20:50.165 --> 21:05.025
I think I'd make it for scholarships, if you could 
ever figure out how, for

20:50.165 --> 21:05.025
eligible low-income kids. Offhand, that'd be my 
first thought. It would be scholarships for

21:07.268 --> 21:10.673
people who can't afford to go to school. All right, 
how do you pick, then, of all those? That's the

21:13.177 --> 21:13.797
question. No, of all those who are low-income, how 
do you select the winners? Well, they'd have to be

21:17.783 --> 21:19.345
academically qualified. qualified, as 
academically qualified as anybody else, but

21:20.270 --> 21:25.855
simply can't afford to go to college. Now, you say, 
well, if they're academically qualified,

21:26.075 --> 21:28.797
they're going to get a scholarship anyhow. So 
maybe there's other places that are better for it,

21:30.959 --> 21:38.906
but that's my first thought, is kids who need the 
education but yet can't pay for it. To major in? I

21:40.928 --> 21:44.011
don't really care what they major in. So they get to 
go to college. Last question. What feelings do you

21:46.092 --> 21:49.095
have in your heart for Texas A&M today? Well, let me 
tell you how we were when we first got here. Mixed

21:54.979 --> 21:57.122
for one thing, but I guess mixed on everything. 
It's a unique public institution. I can't think of

22:01.670 --> 22:02.792
another one like it. And I remember when we first 
got here, we were like the average, I suppose, new,

22:04.234 --> 22:13.429
recently from the east, by way of Oklahoma. And we 
thought, good God, we've come to the end of the

22:14.000 --> 22:16.864
earth. And we weren't that sophisticated. But it 
was located out here in the middle of no place. When

22:23.334 --> 22:25.878
we got here, there was one eating place, two, I 
guess. There was Arnold's Barbecue and a Rao

22:25.898 --> 22:29.905
Burger in this town. There was no grocery store. 
Well, Charlie's, but nobody shopped there. I

22:32.929 --> 22:35.353
mean, we didn't shop there. And we thought, ooh, 
where have I brought my family? And yet it grows on

22:37.957 --> 22:41.222
you. And then, of course, things changed. 
Certainly it was, and tradition-bound and all

22:43.309 --> 22:50.859
military and all male didn't really know all that 
before we got here. I don't know why they didn't

22:50.879 --> 22:53.202
register to know what made a difference or not. But 
it is, A&M is a, in some cases, it's a fabulous place

22:54.523 --> 23:09.201
in terms of tradition, in terms of loyalty, in 
terms of devotion, and... That sort of thing, it's

23:09.670 --> 23:11.552
beautiful. In terms of other things, it's too, I 
won't use the term narrow-minded, but not open to

23:12.132 --> 23:26.626
other ideas like this gay thing, the controversy 
they're having and so on. But it's a mixed bag, but

23:27.206 --> 23:35.454
we've, I guess, really come to love it. There are 
times you can almost come to tears When you go to

23:38.341 --> 23:44.486
Final Review, not Final Review, but TAPS, not 
TAPS, muster. You know, you're just overcome by

23:45.007 --> 23:47.289
the whole thing. And I did go to Silver Taps when 
General Rutter died. And so there's things like

23:50.932 --> 23:52.814
that that are beautiful. But then on the other 
side, you get these strange things. The whole

23:58.038 --> 24:06.846
bonfire controversy is,

23:58.038 --> 24:06.846
it was just strange, you know, in this day and age. 
It was good and bad, and you just wonder about

24:08.328 --> 24:11.960
things like that. But anyhow, I've come to love it, 
and I guess I'm still an Okie, but I'm glad we came to

24:12.000 --> 24:20.127
Texas.
