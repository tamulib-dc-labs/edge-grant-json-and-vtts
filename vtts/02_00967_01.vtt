WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:06.251
Dr. Robert Chapman, December 4th, 1985. Okay. I 
was a hospital commander at the NANG, the hospital

00:09.054 --> 00:15.921
there, the Air Force Hospital. And in addition, we 
had the 22nd Casualty Staging Flight, which was

00:15.941 --> 00:28.714
responsible for air-backing everybody from the 
Northern Theater out

00:15.941 --> 00:28.714
in I-Corps.

00:30.315 --> 00:31.236
At that time, I was not practicing as an 
anesthesiologist, but I also have my boards in

00:31.621 --> 00:36.777
aerospace medicine. And I was as much concerned 
with the

00:46.522 --> 01:01.484
medical, the total medical management, 
everything from environmental medicine to the

00:46.522 --> 01:01.484
air vac business, and this is why I spent a fair 
amount of my time, not just in, just dealing with

00:46.522 --> 01:01.484
patients who did that, too. Now,

01:01.524 --> 01:11.719
what specific questions did you, do you have in 
mind?

01:16.829 --> 01:20.775
To begin with, if you could tell me how you got into 
the military service. Well, I was a career

01:21.637 --> 01:24.762
military officer. As a matter of fact, I retired 
from the Air Force in 1978, but I came in under the

01:24.782 --> 01:33.876
senior medical student program in 1958. I've

01:33.996 --> 01:41.568
had a lot of experience with the Air Force. My dad 
was a So Brown Shoe Army, 88 Air Force later became

01:45.247 --> 01:48.291
the Air Force. So I grew up moving around from 
pillar to post and all that sort of thing. I always

01:52.996 --> 01:54.498
enjoyed flying. And so I got interested in the 
military as a career.

02:03.568 --> 02:05.070
Is that enough on that one? Mm-hmm. And what years 
were you actually in Vietnam? I went to Vietnam in

02:10.836 --> 02:14.781
1975.

02:16.685 --> 02:24.055
One, 372, the time of the last big Tet Offensive.

02:26.858 --> 02:31.023
Was it the case that with most doctors there just 
for like a year at a time? I know all three of the

02:31.044 --> 02:33.266
people I've interviewed have just been there a 
year. That was the standard military tour, was a

02:33.346 --> 02:36.210
year at a time. There were very few physicians that 
went back for more than one tour. I can think of only

02:40.536 --> 02:43.840
maybe one. There were other line officers who went 
back for more than one, because at that time it was

02:44.461 --> 02:56.963
the only war going, and they all thought it was a 
great way to enhance their career, find new

02:44.461 --> 02:56.963
combat. And you mentioned you were stationed in 
Denain. What type of hospital? Was it one of the big

03:02.893 --> 03:04.616
regional hospitals? No, this was a small base 
hospital. We had two regional hospitals, the 95th

03:07.681 --> 03:15.690
and back, which was an Army hospital about seven 
miles away. And for a while we had a Navy hospital

03:17.071 --> 03:27.102
ship that was right in Da Nang Harbor, but it moved 
out just as I got there. So we basically, for our

03:27.122 --> 03:32.888
neurosurgery and so forth, we had that. We had a 
100-bed casualty staging unit, which received

03:32.948 --> 03:37.553
casualties from all through I-Corps, from way on 
south

03:38.208 --> 03:54.917
down to almost to

03:38.208 --> 03:54.917
about a third of the way down to Cameron. And the 
casualties were, after they were processed, they

03:56.019 --> 04:03.912
were processed through us, and then we, they were 
vacuumed out. mostly to Clark, some to Cadena,

04:04.718 --> 04:11.006
some

04:04.718 --> 04:11.006
to Japan. And what rank did you achieve in the 
North? I was a colonel. I was an lieutenant colonel

04:16.934 --> 04:23.062
at the

04:16.934 --> 04:23.062
time. How do you think the, what was the general 
condition of the hospitals in Vietnam? The

04:28.970 --> 04:34.017
hospitals we were in, much like Cameron, they were 
prefabricated The equipment was pretty good, and

04:34.705 --> 04:46.442
considering the shape of the rest of the buildings 
in Vietnam, these hospitals were pretty good. We

04:46.462 --> 05:00.882
went through a typhoon there that did some 
significant amount of damage to our particular

04:46.462 --> 05:00.882
building, but the

04:46.462 --> 05:00.882
facilities there were not bad at all.

05:04.760 --> 05:32.640
pleasant atmosphere to work in as pleasant as can 
be considering the uh

05:04.760 --> 05:32.640
there's no by no stretch of the imagination can you 
be called pull over to some base where you're

05:04.760 --> 05:32.640
restricted to the base because everything else is 
you're running danger getting shot at being

05:04.760 --> 05:32.640
rocketed three or four times a week i mean there's 
no way you can make that pleasant but all things

05:04.760 --> 05:32.640
considered um Compared with some of the other 
places in Vietnam, it wasn't all that bad, except

05:33.515 --> 05:40.122
maybe down around Saigon. We used to go down to 
Saigon for R&R, to Cam Ranh, too. Cam Ranh was

05:44.307 --> 05:51.194
relatively pleasant.

05:51.214 --> 05:53.376
Have you ever watched MASH, the TV show? Yeah. How 
did the situation there compare to life on MASH?

05:59.383 --> 06:02.526
Well, MASH is a comedy show. And there are some 
things, some of the little irritating things that

06:03.367 --> 06:14.443
go on with the communications and problems with 
headquarters sometimes and stuff like that. I

06:17.087 --> 06:22.174
thought that, number one, I think the dedication 
of the people that were there was very similar to

06:17.087 --> 06:22.174
mine. But a lot of the tomfoolery didn't go on that 
much. Reason I ask is that some of the people,

06:31.379 --> 06:37.306
that's the only picture they get of what it was 
like. They really believe it's all true.

06:43.473 --> 06:46.656
How much combat danger was the hospital you were 
in? Well,

06:47.597 --> 06:51.382
significant. One Christmas party, we took some 
people out to a perimeter gate and got sniped at.

07:00.168 --> 07:02.772
Sniper fire was not at all unusual.

07:05.416 --> 07:08.201
We had regular rocket attacks. The barracks right 
across the street from the hospital was getting

07:08.261 --> 07:17.436
destroyed, killed about 10 or 12 people, and 
damaged a whole bunch of others. I had a one

07:17.456 --> 07:23.726
122-millimeter rocket dutted right outside my 
quarters. It was a good thing it dutted. It would

07:24.788 --> 07:27.492
have blown my quarters to pieces. And we had fairly 
regular amounts of damage from rocketry.

07:43.681 --> 07:45.963
Was sanitation a problem?

07:49.166 --> 07:53.469
Not on the base, per se, because we could control 
that. Sanitation was a problem when you got off the

07:53.590 --> 07:58.474
base. Of course, remember, Da Nang was one of the 
larger French settlements, and at one time was a

07:58.589 --> 08:14.410
very pleasant village, wonderful natural 
resources. They had one area where there was a

08:14.430 --> 08:21.599
beautiful beach, and the fishing was great. You 
could catch a huge lot of shrimp and things like

08:21.639 --> 08:27.567
this. We couldn't go down there and get them and eat 
them because they were so contaminated with

08:27.749 --> 08:44.971
hepatitis that you stood about a 50-50 chance 
because most of the sewage effluent from the

08:27.749 --> 08:44.971
sewage drained right out into the bay where the 
shrimp people were doing all the fishing. So fresh

08:45.351 --> 08:54.162
food from a Vietnamese standpoint was not really 
obtainable. Some people ate it, sure, but it

08:57.769 --> 09:07.825
wasn't saved.

09:07.846 --> 09:14.196
Was the number of doctors and medics available 
adequate for the number of casualties

09:07.846 --> 09:14.196
encountered? For the most part, yeah. It's like 
anything else. Casualties don't come in one at a

09:18.062 --> 09:19.845
time. They come in in bunches of 50. And at that 
time, you wished you had four or five more people.

09:26.001 --> 09:32.688
But most of the time, as far as handling the base 
support and so forth, we had an adequate staff.

09:37.793 --> 09:42.177
How was the quality of that staff, the medical 
personnel? They were very good. We had, in our

09:44.920 --> 09:50.946
particular situation, and I'm going to consider 
the Army too, They had two thoracic guys. They had

09:54.713 --> 09:57.277
two neurosurgeons. They had ENT. They had 
internal medicine and cardiology. They had a

10:04.310 --> 10:14.588
dermatologist or two dermatologists and a large 
selection of general surgeons and orthopedic

10:04.310 --> 10:14.588
surgeons. Some of which were fully trained, board 
eligible, and some of which were partially

10:14.905 --> 10:19.453
trained. They came in on the very plan after they'd 
done two or three years of their residency.

10:27.126 --> 10:40.069
Our staff was primarily,

10:27.126 --> 10:40.069
we had two partially trained general surgeons, 
and the rest were general medical officers. And

10:41.382 --> 10:46.449
they were primarily responsible for the care of 
the base. The surgical problems and other things

10:46.469 --> 10:51.355
went over to the Army, or when the Navy was there, to 
the Navy. And we spent probably

10:52.316 --> 11:05.234
most of our inpatient load was concerned with the 
casualty staging.

11:05.254 --> 11:10.140
Did you see a difference in quality between the 
drafted doctors and the career doctors? Well, I

11:12.685 --> 11:16.089
was the only career doctor, so it's hard to 
compare. There were a few, few career doctors at

11:18.152 --> 11:24.900
Cameron. There were very few at the Army, but 
almost everybody there were either grafted or

11:25.000 --> 11:34.050
came in under the very plan.

11:34.071 --> 11:39.537
I remember at that time, military service was

11:41.474 --> 11:42.815
and very poor repute. There was a lot of feeling, 
you know, over here on the stateside against the

11:43.096 --> 11:47.920
war. And, you know, it got, a couple of my doctors 
told me when they went home they were, they didn't

11:48.861 --> 11:59.531
put on their uniforms because people would accost 
them and call them baby killers. You know, it was

11:59.551 --> 12:00.812
really kind of nasty. So,

12:02.474 --> 12:11.042
almost all of our people at that time were

12:02.474 --> 12:11.042
people. What year did you actually enter the 
service, did you say? I entered in 1958. You

12:16.439 --> 12:17.801
entered in 1958. So you didn't really know 
anything about what was happening in Vietnam

12:17.821 --> 12:23.349
then, because it wasn't happening yet. No. My 
first trip to Vietnam was in 1960. We went over

12:27.395 --> 12:29.057
there on an exercise. It was kind of a show of force. 
We went over to the Philippines. went over and

12:32.723 --> 12:38.950
spent a couple of days in Saigon, which the first 
time I was there, it was a beautiful city. And then

12:38.970 --> 12:50.282
after the war started and things really got nasty, 
when I was back in 71, it was amazing how much it had

12:38.970 --> 12:50.282
changed. It was just a grubby, full of refugees and 
shanty towns. It was just like a completely

12:57.930 --> 12:59.872
different place. Do you think that... If you'd 
have been 10 years later, becoming a doctor in

13:03.470 --> 13:14.348
1968, would you think you would have joined the 
Army, knowing what was happening in Vietnam?

13:15.370 --> 13:17.333
Well, that's hard to say. I know it's 
hypothetical. It's a very hypothetical

13:19.136 --> 13:22.221
situation. You'd have to assume at the same time 
that I'd have been 10 years younger. and probably

13:26.622 --> 13:40.818
would have had a little more of the opinion that the 
young people at that time had,

13:26.622 --> 13:40.818
even in spite of the fact of having grown up in the 
service.

13:46.304 --> 13:52.431
I had a pretty good idea of what life was like, but I 
enjoyed my service life. My wife and I both

13:53.192 --> 13:56.275
thoroughly enjoyed it. Did you find adequate 
medical supplies available to you in Vietnam?

14:07.651 --> 14:08.573
For the most part, yeah. There were a few things 
that we would run short of. Other supplies,

14:11.357 --> 14:15.203
there's the standard everyday living. Sometimes 
the VX was out of soap. Sometimes it was out of razor

14:18.047 --> 14:21.392
blades. You couldn't get things like that from 
time to time.

14:27.490 --> 14:42.914
from medical supplies, we never really were 
hurting, other than maybe it being short a day or

14:27.490 --> 14:42.914
two because some supply flight from Cameron on to 
our main warehouse and so forth was delayed. But we

14:42.934 --> 14:45.157
traded back and forth with the Army quite a bit. If 
they were out of something, we had it. We'd loan it

14:46.760 --> 14:50.666
to them, and then they'd pay it back, and we'd 
borrow something from them the next time. There

14:51.647 --> 14:54.031
was a lot of that going on. How about blood? Was 
there always plenty of it? Yeah, we had adequate

14:56.228 --> 15:00.473
stores of blood. We had a blood bank, plus we had a 
walking blood bank.

15:06.219 --> 15:16.750
Being on an Air Force base, most of the people there 
were service people in the standpoint, as opposed

15:06.219 --> 15:16.750
to combat people.

15:18.212 --> 15:25.780
And we had a rather large pool of bodies that we 
could draw from if we needed blood, and we

15:18.212 --> 15:25.780
occasionally would call on them. Was

15:27.683 --> 15:38.916
all the advanced medical equipment that was 
available in the United States, was that also

15:27.683 --> 15:38.916
available to you over there?

15:43.621 --> 15:52.672
Well, if you're talking about state-of-the-art 
stuff, no, because we really didn't need it. We

15:52.692 --> 15:56.256
weren't doing the kind of procedures that 
demanded that sort of thing. We had adequate

15:56.337 --> 16:16.763
anesthesia equipment, we had adequate surgical 
equipment, but most of the stuff we were doing

15:56.337 --> 16:16.763
in-country was a patch-up, do immediate repair, 
and then send off to the medical centers,

15:56.337 --> 16:16.763
sometimes in the States, sometimes to Clark or 
Kadena, one of the larger offshore islands.

16:17.744 --> 16:21.349
Kadena's in Okinawa, by the way. where they would 
go through, and if they had a second surgical

16:21.751 --> 16:31.460
procedure, or they had to recuperate, or they had 
physical therapy, and all of the other things,

16:21.751 --> 16:31.460
they were given there. And if they were reasonably 
bad off, they went back to the States. I can't

16:36.124 --> 16:47.274
remember one time I was going home on leave, and we 
got the grand sum of two weeks leave the year we were

16:36.124 --> 16:47.274
over there. And there was a kid who had a... a big 
chunk of his skull removed, and it had the

16:53.257 --> 17:02.166
neurosurgical procedures necessary to clean it 
up and so forth. But he had to go back, and they had to

17:02.186 --> 17:06.730
fit him with a titanium piece to put on it. And 
because he had, in essence, an open wound, you

17:07.771 --> 17:19.703
know, where the dural was sewed, or a synthetic 
dural was put over it, the dural was gone, too. and

17:20.577 --> 17:23.922
he had been cleared of his infections and so forth. 
But because he was so sensitive, they wanted a

17:23.942 --> 17:26.466
medical attendant. So I flew home with him as a 
medical attendant on the aerobatic system. I took

17:31.614 --> 17:34.839
him to Walter Reed, and then went from there on. But 
there were a lot of patients that we had to send.

17:44.202 --> 17:51.754
physicians with, or if we couldn't, if there 
weren't any physicians available, many times

17:44.202 --> 17:51.754
we'd send a nurse, a special nurse that sat there 
and just took care of that patient. Because we'd

17:52.635 --> 18:06.176
load these folks up in 141s, and, you know, you may 
be carrying sometimes 130s, but you may be

17:52.635 --> 18:06.176
carrying anywhere from 25 to 50 patients. There 
was just a lot for the attendants there to do, so we

18:06.637 --> 18:12.606
would frequently have to to send tenants along 
with them. They were really seriously wounded.

18:23.071 --> 18:30.458
What were the prevalent combat injuries you 
encountered?

18:30.478 --> 18:43.690
Well,

18:30.478 --> 18:43.690
projectile wounds from shrapnel, bullets, wood, 
what have you, claymore mines, this sort of thing,

18:44.227 --> 18:46.793
were fairly common.

18:48.797 --> 18:49.960
Also accidental wounds. We probably had almost as 
many guys damaged by 151 jeeps rolling over. The

18:57.778 --> 19:00.143
M151 is a good cross-country, rough terrain 
vehicle, but it's not worth a damn on a highway

19:00.967 --> 19:07.633
because it rolls very easily. And we had a bunch of 
kids out there running around perimeter roads and

19:07.653 --> 19:13.137
running around getting these highways that roll 
the ditch. So we lost a lot of, had a lot of

19:14.278 --> 19:20.283
casualties from that type of accident. We would 
occasionally get some in from the Navy that had

19:20.303 --> 19:28.230
been injured. They'd be air back to us on a 
helicopter. And then we would put them on an

19:30.852 --> 19:34.996
air-vac system to get them back to the States. But 
it had injuries, industrial-type injuries,

19:35.657 --> 19:45.708
catapult cables breaking and snapping, you know, 
double amputees and that sort of thing, and this

19:35.657 --> 19:45.708
sort of thing. It was kind of a dangerous life on the 
carrier and on the flight deck. Yeah. And the usual

19:50.493 --> 19:57.400
run of sicknesses, everything from leukemia to, 
you know,

20:01.075 --> 20:07.682
Everything that can happen in a non-wartime 
population happens in the others, too.

20:10.865 --> 20:16.231
What was the prevalent non-combat disease that 
you saw? Well, the prevalent non-combat casualty

20:16.251 --> 20:22.497
was from an accident. Disease-wise,

20:22.617 --> 20:29.985
pneumonia and infection of various and sundry 
types. uh you know boils and abrasions and things

20:30.927 --> 21:00.630
that weren't properly taken care of on the field 
that became infected and they get a cellulitis and

20:30.927 --> 21:00.630
this sort of things but usually those we were able 
to take care of in country um we had had several uh

20:30.927 --> 21:00.630
kids with leukemia and uh various and some of the 
other there was a couple of uh terrible carcinomas

20:30.927 --> 21:00.630
of the testicles and things that you are fairly 
common with young adult males.

21:10.248 --> 21:11.490
What about venereal disease? I know that was a 
problem. That was a big problem.

21:18.358 --> 21:21.101
There was quite a lot of it. And of course, at that 
time, the gonorrhea was very much penicillin

21:21.121 --> 21:27.788
resistant. And it could be very difficult to 
treat. And because our case-finding techniques,

21:31.677 --> 21:54.220
these are usually coming from Vietnamese women, 
and it was very difficult to track them down, to,

21:31.677 --> 21:54.220
you know, to get them treated so that they wouldn't 
re-infect with all the standard education things

21:31.677 --> 21:54.220
and, you know, advice on prophylaxis and that sort 
of stuff.

21:59.345 --> 21:59.725
You know, it's a... I had one guy... asking him 
where he got it and how he got it, and he got it

22:01.073 --> 22:05.924
through a chain wire fence. This gal backed up to 
the fence for a couple of yen there. He got his own

22:11.757 --> 22:16.467
Elizabeth through the fence, and he got more than 
he bargained for. And there was a lot of that sort of

22:17.071 --> 22:20.655
stuff. The other big public health hazard we had 
there were drugs.

22:30.705 --> 22:36.831
We had a real problem, particularly with heroin. 
We don't know that it's true for a fact, but we think

22:36.851 --> 22:45.120
that it was being brought in and sold on the base as 
being made in Cambodia. being brought in to the

22:45.640 --> 22:54.168
base as a means of

22:45.640 --> 22:54.168
kind of weakening the force. I mean, it was an 
actual espionage type of thing. And you could buy

22:58.753 --> 23:05.239
what in the States would be, you know, $100 worth of 
stuff. You could buy it for five bucks, and you can

23:05.259 --> 23:07.842
get it. There was no problem at all getting it, in 
spite of all the shakedowns we had and getting all

23:12.843 --> 23:18.249
the monosons and breaking them down and searching 
and everything else. It's just, you know, the

23:18.349 --> 23:24.416
human mind is too ingenious for us to keep from 
hiding it. We had this one thing where there was a

23:24.436 --> 23:39.272
deal called Golden Flow where everybody would 
come in and would be told, you know, that they had to

23:24.436 --> 23:39.272
report that time at that date, you know, 
immediately. for a urine check, and we were

23:39.674 --> 23:47.263
running the urines through spectrographic 
analysis to see if anybody was on drugs. And

23:47.283 --> 23:54.132
it was a real hassle. Of course, you weren't 
probably aware of it at that time, but that was when

23:54.152 --> 24:08.770
the drug culture was really coming on pretty 
strong, and the hippies and the flower children

23:54.152 --> 24:08.770
and all these folks. a very accepted form of 
behavior in the young adults, particularly a lot

24:09.391 --> 24:33.745
of those GIs, the soldiers, particularly the Army 
types, were from poor ghetto-type families, and

24:09.391 --> 24:33.745
they had probably been exposed to a considerable 
amount of it. We had a real problem keeping drugs

24:35.378 --> 24:42.225
from decreasing the combat readiness. We spent a 
lot of time on it. How about drugs among the staff,

24:47.011 --> 24:52.557
the medical staff, corpsmen and the nurses? Had 
one nurse, a couple of corpsmen, no physicians

24:53.598 --> 25:02.888
that I'm aware of. Anyway, and they all tested out 
long. And most of the positions that, at least that

25:08.178 --> 25:19.173
I had, and I can only speak from my facility, 
positions we had were all pretty much straight

25:08.178 --> 25:19.173
shooters, and they saw the problem for what it was.

25:22.578 --> 25:26.243
Also, they were all from the South and from the 
Midwest, where that culture hadn't really caught

25:27.421 --> 25:37.417
on as strong, you know, as the California and the 
East Coast types were more apt to have that kind of

25:27.421 --> 25:37.417
thought. At least that was my experience.

25:42.745 --> 25:47.633
Was there any problems with the addiction to the 
pain reliever? No, we didn't have patients long

25:47.653 --> 25:51.759
enough, really. I mean, if they were bad enough 
where they needed, narcotic analgesics, they

25:55.315 --> 26:02.746
were usually shipped out to Clark

25:55.315 --> 26:02.746
or somewhere else. So we only used, you know, we're 
talking about in our casualty staging unit, we

26:02.766 --> 26:15.645
only kept them, the longest period of time was 
about six days.

26:15.665 --> 26:18.409
You mentioned infections a while ago. Was that a 
major problem? Well, at that time, we had a pretty

26:22.155 --> 26:23.837
good pretty good armamentarium with 
antibiotics, so it wasn't a major problem. But we

26:27.630 --> 26:31.354
did get some resistant organisms. And most combat 
wounds are dirty wounds. Number one, when you've

26:35.620 --> 26:50.398
been out grunging around in the mud for a while, and 
haven't bathed in two or three weeks, other than a

26:35.620 --> 26:50.398
quick dip in the polluting stream, maybe, and you 
get a wound that penetrates and goes through

26:51.627 --> 27:03.960
leather and cloth and skin and everything else and 
deposits all this inside, chances of infection

26:51.627 --> 27:03.960
are pretty high. But we didn't have nearly the 
problem in the First World War, you know, getting

27:03.980 --> 27:17.213
shot was almost a death sentence because of 
infection.

27:18.138 --> 27:29.392
We didn't have any real major problems from that 
standpoint, just the occasional

27:18.138 --> 27:29.392
antibiotic-resistant

27:18.138 --> 27:29.392
holding. I know there was, like you said, a lot of 
diseases that you'd catch at home that caught

27:29.412 --> 27:33.537
there, too. Was there any... How much was the 
disease due to the region they were in? We saw a lot

27:40.926 --> 27:43.450
of amobiasis. We saw giardia. We saw...

27:49.492 --> 27:57.529
very little in other than the echo virus and that 
sort of thing. It usually went around just within

27:57.689 --> 28:01.837
the military population.

28:04.703 --> 28:09.373
Didn't, you know, the typhoid and typhus and all 
the big epidemic things that were such problems in

28:10.147 --> 28:14.956
the past we didn't have because we had excellent 
immunization programs. People didn't come over

28:14.976 --> 28:23.993
to that theater unless they were adequately 
immunized against those diseases. So we had a full

28:24.013 --> 28:32.188
global type thing, everything from smallpox to 
typhus, typhoid,

28:35.324 --> 28:41.758
If there was an immunization possible, everybody 
over there had it. So there are immunizations. The

28:43.121 --> 28:53.603
only patient I can recall that we had any real 
problems with was a patient who came in with what we

28:43.121 --> 28:53.603
thought was typhoid. And sure enough, he had 
typhoid, but he also didn't have any white cells

28:54.629 --> 29:00.897
because he was leukemia. So he had very 
ineffective white cells. So he had, in essence,

29:04.362 --> 29:11.351
had leukemia, which was undiagnosed. And got 
challenged with a typhoid bug, came down with it,

29:11.371 --> 29:22.746
just by virtue of having a defective aneurysm, 
defective antibody system. What

29:24.650 --> 29:40.312
percent, I guess, on the percentage of the 
servicemen that were admitted to your hospital

29:24.650 --> 29:40.312
for psychiatric reasons?

29:40.333 --> 29:42.896
Well, we did not have a psychiatric section as 
such. The psych patients were sent to over to the

29:42.916 --> 29:51.829
9-5th where they had a closed ward holding type 
thing. But I imagine But can we break this down into

29:54.653 --> 29:59.060
major psychiatric? By this I mean psychosis, 
major psychoneurosis,

29:59.080 --> 30:09.957
probably less than 2%. But we did have some people 
who came in with minor problems that they needed to

30:09.997 --> 30:18.670
work out with psychosomatic illness. that sort of 
thing, and that probably was more like about

30:19.342 --> 30:25.948
10-15% of the patients we were treating. And 
usually these responded to being able to sit down

30:25.968 --> 30:47.847
and talk about their problems, and a lot of them 
were problems from frustration because they were

30:25.968 --> 30:47.847
having problems at home, or kids were doing 
poorly, or they were sick, or the mama was running

30:25.968 --> 30:47.847
around, or something like this, and they were 
stuck there and they couldn't do anything about

30:25.968 --> 30:47.847
it, and it was just a frustration phenomenon.

30:48.974 --> 30:51.378
So they would come up with some of these other 
things. Sometimes they'd have to get emergency

30:51.398 --> 31:04.739
leaves or other types of ancillary support to kind 
of help them over their little crisis, and then

30:51.398 --> 31:04.739
they would come back and do a good job. I was more 
interested in the number that were just going

31:04.759 --> 31:13.213
crazy because of the situation, because of the war 
situation. Completely went bonkers. Mm-hmm.

31:16.025 --> 31:24.439
Probably of that,

31:16.025 --> 31:24.439
I'd say less than one percent. I can only remember 
one or two, one or two guys, and he was probably a

31:24.459 --> 31:32.653
character and behavior disorder and not truly a 
psychosis.

31:36.199 --> 31:39.805
He took his commander at gunpoint, colandeered a 
helicopter and flew down. And we went out and

31:41.641 --> 31:53.355
talked with him, the base commander, and the wing 
commander and I went out and we sat down and

31:41.641 --> 31:53.355
negotiated with this guy and finally convinced 
him to give up his gun. We sent him over to talk to the

31:53.375 --> 31:58.400
shrinks, sent him back on a medical type thing. But 
I'm not convinced that this was truly a psychosis.

32:01.264 --> 32:03.066
I think he was a character behavior disorder. We 
talked with his commander later. There had been a

32:05.869 --> 32:09.353
problem, you know, and just all along, and ever 
since he'd been in the service. Character and

32:13.409 --> 32:21.718
behavior disorders were probably the major 
psychiatric difficulty we ran into in the

32:13.409 --> 32:21.718
service. Most of the guys, when they come in, 
they're reasonably well-screened.

32:30.928 --> 32:36.354
How high was the survival rate for a wounded 
soldier? I thought it was very high. I couldn't

32:37.636 --> 32:39.778
give you an exact statistic. If

32:40.214 --> 32:54.013
a guy lived to make it to the back units, he probably 
had a 99.9 chance of making it. What they were in the

32:54.033 --> 33:03.606
combat aid stations and so forth, you know, the 
guys that got hit by a Claymore mine and had holes in

32:54.033 --> 33:03.606
everything they owned. These fellas had kept some 
of them alive for a while, but a lot of them didn't

33:03.873 --> 33:09.839
make it. There was no way they could have made it if 
it hadn't on the front step of the biggest hospital

33:09.859 --> 33:14.544
in the world.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.592
What was the likely fate of an injured soldier? 
Would the majority of them return to further

33:21.632 --> 33:24.415
combat? Depends entirely on the injury. If a fella 
had a minor wound, say just a a wound involving a

33:33.353 --> 33:52.895
laceration or a simple break like a finger or a toe 
or something that was not incapacitated, he'd be

33:33.353 --> 33:52.895
sent back to Clark or someplace like this, allowed 
to heal, and sent back to Vietnam. If it was

33:52.915 --> 34:03.327
something that was more major, a broken femur or a 
bad knee, injuries, other serious wounds,

34:03.880 --> 34:15.531
intestinal wounds, and this sort of thing that 
required prolonged things, they'd be sent back to

34:03.880 --> 34:15.531
the States, and they were not sent back. Unless 
they volunteered to come back. I think, as I

34:18.394 --> 34:33.128
recall, the policy at that time was that if it was 
going to take more time, or it was going to take six

34:18.394 --> 34:33.128
months to rehabilitate them, and even though they 
would be able to come back for six months, It was

34:33.361 --> 34:35.965
better to get somebody who could come in for a whole 
year. It was more economical.

34:41.715 --> 34:47.384
So they usually didn't take these people. A lot of 
these people were sitting there, and they'd be

34:47.424 --> 34:56.298
wounded after they'd been in three or four months 
or six months, and they wouldn't be back before the

34:47.424 --> 34:56.298
tour was over anyway. So, of course, they didn't 
come back.

35:01.323 --> 35:03.226
You've mentioned AIRVAC a few times. Can you 
elaborate on that a little bit and tell me how it

35:04.868 --> 35:08.233
worked? Well, there were basically

35:08.253 --> 35:13.299
three stages of AIRVAC. The first and probably the 
most critical was run by the Army, and that's the

35:13.320 --> 35:20.770
medivac system, the helicopters. And these were 
medical service officers who flew the

35:21.771 --> 35:31.144
helicopters with crews that were trained 
specifically to take care and to pick up wounded.

35:32.390 --> 35:33.271
and they would go out. They were in constant radio 
contact, and they'd have one point where it was

35:35.955 --> 35:47.411
kind of an assembling area, and they would ship 
them out to pick up wounded wherever they might be,

35:35.955 --> 35:47.411
because Vietnam was not so large. You weren't in 
helicopter range or someplace. And they'd go out

35:50.816 --> 36:01.671
and pick up the wounded in the helicopters, and 
they were using

35:50.816 --> 36:01.671
Hueys,

36:03.035 --> 36:30.409
four or five wounded at the same time and it then 
they would bring them back to uh depending

36:03.035 --> 36:30.409
on the situation now right around us they brought 
them right back to the 95th evac hospital but there

36:03.035 --> 36:30.409
were some other hospitals smaller hospitals like 
the mass units that were out in the fields further

36:03.035 --> 36:30.409
south where they weren't quite so close they would 
bring them back then where they would get their

36:03.035 --> 36:30.409
immediate triage and and carried then they would 
be aerovac uh from there uh if it was an isolated

36:30.912 --> 37:00.683
army post by helicopter if it was they brought them 
to one of the larger bases that had a landing strip

36:30.912 --> 37:00.683
then they would fly by 130 back or long den or one of 
the several large army hospitals and they would go

36:30.912 --> 37:00.683
from there if further evacuation was warranted 
then they would go from there through us, through

37:01.034 --> 37:15.675
the casualty staging units, which were at, uh, 
they had one at Cameron, they had one at Da Nang, and

37:01.034 --> 37:15.675
they had one at, uh, at, uh, Saigon, at Townsend. 
And these people would be processed through them,

37:17.277 --> 37:28.172
and from there they would go to either Japan, uh, 
Okinawa, or Clark, and then they would either stay

37:17.277 --> 37:28.172
there overnight, or maybe for four or five days, 
depending on their condition, and then they would

37:28.540 --> 37:36.909
be put on a long haul and be brought back to the 
States. So, you know, it would depend on the

37:36.929 --> 37:48.661
nature of the wound and the nature of the problem as 
to where they would stop in these intermediate

37:36.929 --> 37:48.661
ways. You know, if a guy got a bullet that creased 
his shoulder or a fragment tear or something on his

37:48.681 --> 37:57.450
shoulder, he might go to the Italian aid station 
and fix him up And that would be the minute of flying

37:57.886 --> 37:59.988
back to his unit. That would be about all there 
would be to it. But for the more seriously wounded,

38:03.873 --> 38:22.454
it really, we had guys that were seriously wounded 
and were back in the United States at a major

38:03.873 --> 38:22.454
military hospital in four days.

38:22.794 --> 38:23.776
So it's a good system. And that's with immediate, 
that's with care and treatment and everything

38:23.836 --> 38:27.640
along the way. That was one of the biggest 
improvements made over the Korean War. Can you

38:35.038 --> 38:39.303
think of any other improvements that were made in 
the Vietnam War over the Korean?

38:44.308 --> 38:49.473
Primarily, of course, we had a better selection of 
antibiotics. During the Korean War, they had

38:49.513 --> 38:53.998
penicillin, they had streptomycin, they had 
sulfonyl. And that was essentially it. The later

38:56.225 --> 39:00.350
part, then, they had some chloromycetins and 
other things. We had a much more, much broader

39:00.390 --> 39:05.056
spectrum of antibiotics. Korea, they were just 
experimenting with vascular surgery. That's how

39:10.963 --> 39:17.651
Denton Cooley and some of them got their start on 
vascular surgery, carrying war injuries in

39:10.963 --> 39:17.651
Korea. In Vietnam, vascular surgery was already 
pretty far along, and there was a lot of things done

39:21.113 --> 39:27.482
at the knife at the back and so forth. The major 
vascular injuries were repaired by just, you

39:28.183 --> 39:39.439
know, resecting the damaged artery and putting it 
in the graft, and we didn't have that in Korea.

39:45.848 --> 39:49.753
The systems were faster in Korea. If you were 
wounded, they put you on a DC-3, a C-47, or a C-54,

39:50.020 --> 40:06.304
lead you to Japan, which took about two or four 
hours. And then from Japan back, it was almost all

40:07.666 --> 40:14.035
reset-type airbag things or going back by ship. I 
was middle of the ship. And so it was a long time

40:16.987 --> 40:24.899
between the time you got there to where you were to 
get definitive care in the final form. Whereas in

40:24.919 --> 40:31.228
the Aerovac system with larger jet aircraft, they 
would haul more and haul them a lot faster. As I

40:31.689 --> 40:42.505
said, it was sometimes a matter of four days before 
somebody was in the stateside hospital getting

40:31.689 --> 40:42.505
that subspecialty super care that they needed.

40:48.020 --> 40:54.910
I can't think of a great deal of warfare from the 
standpoint of the guy in the trench. It hasn't

40:54.931 --> 41:00.799
changed just a hell of a bunch.

41:00.819 --> 41:07.750
Hearing it just a little bit further, can you think 
of any lessons that were learned in medicine as a

41:00.819 --> 41:07.750
result of Vietnam?

41:13.687 --> 41:17.954
That's a pretty profound question. I don't know. 
Maybe I didn't word it right. No. I think that you

41:20.758 --> 41:25.226
worded it right, but it covers a multitude of 
things. I think we learned that our Aerovac system

41:26.508 --> 41:35.582
was a good system, and it could be refined maybe 
even a little more. And we learned the importance

41:37.225 --> 41:40.470
of maintaining an Aerovac system. From purely the 
medical standpoint, the need for having

41:42.475 --> 42:04.180
well-equipped, transportable, pre-assembled 
hospitals, I think, was something that they

41:42.475 --> 42:04.180
learned out of that, because it wasn't until well 
along in the Vietnam War that they came up with

41:42.475 --> 42:04.180
these things. They were going to have to kind of do 
make do. That whole base went up in about two weeks,

42:07.518 --> 42:15.088
and the hospital put it together in a couple of 
days. But everything was pre-packed. They just

42:17.411 --> 42:22.659
brought it off the ship, put it on the barge, hauled 
it up to the crane, put it in, and dropped it in

42:17.411 --> 42:22.659
place. And they hooked them all together like a 
giant tinker toy. And so they did come up with that

42:27.325 --> 42:33.373
lesson, the importance of having these things 
that rapidly able to be moved and put up in place,

42:34.197 --> 42:44.948
and if necessary, torn down and taken someplace 
else. The necessity for the immunization

42:45.569 --> 42:56.781
procedures was

42:45.569 --> 42:56.781
well proven in World War II, and that wasn't 
exactly a new lesson. It was just like many things,

42:56.801 --> 43:01.926
one of the things we had to relearn.

43:06.783 --> 43:14.311
The real basic question is that war is hell and it 
doesn't make any difference how well you're

43:06.783 --> 43:14.311
equipped and everything, that there are a lot of 
people suffering and a lot of people dying. It's

43:15.252 --> 43:17.935
best to avoid one if you can. I think that's kind of a 
general summation of

43:17.955 --> 43:28.687
it.

43:30.048 --> 43:35.254
Someone mentioned that intensive care units in 
hospitals were improved. That's not fact-based.

43:38.014 --> 43:38.975
What do you think about that? Yeah, they are. The 
intensive care equipment

43:40.356 --> 43:49.065
that we have, and a lot of the procedures, too, have 
changed since then.

43:52.208 --> 44:04.380
We still had a one-on-one nurse, and a good, smart 
intensive care nurse doesn't need a whole bunch of

43:52.208 --> 44:04.380
stuff to tell her that the patient's good or the 
patient's going bad. I'm a firm believer in

44:04.512 --> 44:07.435
looking at folks, you know. And the 
sophistication of today, you know, where you can

44:07.455 --> 44:27.598
hook a guy up to an automatic blood pressure 
impulse and all this stuff and have it all read out

44:07.455 --> 44:27.598
in a purized area means that, you know, you can kind 
of divvy up the workload. I don't really know, with

44:27.618 --> 44:31.903
the exception of some of the newer drugs that we 
have, We do any better job now in intensive care

44:32.575 --> 44:39.782
than we did then. Just our basic equipment is 
easier to use. It's a little more reliable. But

44:46.589 --> 45:00.523
when it comes down to the one-on-one of a nurse and a 
patient and a physician taking care of them, I just

44:46.589 --> 45:00.523
don't know that we do any better now than we did 
then. I've done a lot of reading on this, on some of

45:01.162 --> 45:05.327
the statistics and stuff in Vietnam. The majority 
of the deaths resulted from injuries to the face

45:06.889 --> 45:11.575
and neck region. Can you think of any way that can be 
prevented or some kind of a... Well, the reason

45:13.257 --> 45:26.292
that's true, if you think about combat and what 
happens to a guy, number one, he's wearing a flak

45:13.257 --> 45:26.292
jacket. Most of them had on flak jackets. So the 
thorax is pretty well protected and they're

45:31.672 --> 45:59.788
hiding in a hole and what's exposed the head and the 
shoulder that's why most of the injuries are based

45:31.672 --> 45:59.788
on that all right one other thing that crossed my 
mind when i was reading all this most of the death

45:31.672 --> 45:59.788
like you said if they got to the hospital they 
usually survived so most of the deaths were due to

45:31.672 --> 45:59.788
if the helicopters can get in there quick enough 
are Well, I'm sure there were some of that. Most of

46:01.513 --> 46:07.740
the deaths were because they were so badly damaged 
that they couldn't survive no matter where they

46:01.513 --> 46:07.740
were. I think

46:07.760 --> 46:21.734
if they received what I would call a non-lethal 
injury, something that wasn't going to kill them

46:07.760 --> 46:21.734
regardless, their chances of survival were 
pretty good. But if you've ever seen anybody who's

46:22.775 --> 46:29.202
been hit by an AK-47 about six times, or has been 
blown up by a Claymore mine, there's very damn

46:29.654 --> 46:34.739
little anybody can do for them. And they may still 
be alive, but not for long. And it doesn't make any

46:38.142 --> 46:39.844
difference where they are. So even if their buddy 
next to them was trained in first aid, that's what I

46:39.864 --> 46:45.649
was thinking. Why didn't their soldier be trained 
in first aid? The soldier was trained in first aid.

46:48.953 --> 46:49.273
They were? Sure. They had corpsmen right there 
with them all the time who were really, some of

46:50.574 --> 46:56.220
those corpsmen were really sharp. And they got to 
do damn good. But every GI going through training

46:59.641 --> 47:11.012
who received first aid, he knew how to do a, or was 
told, he maybe didn't know how, but they knew how to

46:59.641 --> 47:11.012
do tracheostomy. They could patch up a sucking 
chest wound. And they carried their first aid kits

47:16.238 --> 47:18.640
with them. Now, they were exposed to the training. 
Not all of them paid any attention. That's true.

47:26.328 --> 47:28.450
But for the most part, the basic simple things that 
could be done in the field were done by the not by the

47:29.206 --> 47:41.511
by the medics necessarily by the corpsmen but by 
the other soldiers
