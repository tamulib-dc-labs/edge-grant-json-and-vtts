WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:08.830
were astronomical, the projections that are 
embodied in the project agreement. In 1989, for

00:09.651 --> 00:20.185
example, the Woodlands would have built over 
4,000 dwelling units. We will do, in 1990, about

00:20.205 --> 00:31.320
950 dwelling units, less than a quarter of what was 
projected to have been done last year. In our best

00:31.520 --> 00:38.810
year, we did about 1,200 dwelling units, and that 
was in the heyday of Houston. The project

00:38.850 --> 00:48.703
agreement contemplated we would have sold that 
many units, sold or built for rent that many units

00:38.850 --> 00:48.703
the first year in development. So it's clearly 
over-optimistic

00:48.723 --> 00:55.873
if you want to give people the benefit of the doubt. 
And then, too, we've added more land to the

00:56.545 --> 00:59.108
woodlands. We've added 50 percent to the land mass 
of the woodlands. So even if we had hit those

01:01.651 --> 01:11.221
projections, we'd still be about a third below 
completion, or where we should be in 1992. So in

01:11.261 --> 01:19.430
1992, if the date hadn't been in there, transition 
will occur because the Covenant's saying that it

01:11.261 --> 01:19.430
will. And the Board will become 
resident-controlled.

01:24.693 --> 01:39.549
The Woodlands Corporation will lose control of a 
very important institution in the Woodlands,

01:24.693 --> 01:39.549
very important to the servicing of the Woodlands 
and the marketing of the Woodlands, long before

01:24.693 --> 01:39.549
the Woodlands is 85% complete. So we then had to 
say, well, what could we do?

01:46.036 --> 01:50.160
We could not afford to lose control of the 
Woodlands. or we could lose control of the WCA, but

01:51.727 --> 02:13.699
within the covenants, there's an entity that's 
created called the Development Standards

01:51.727 --> 02:13.699
Committee, and that is responsible for 
establishing design criteria, development

01:51.727 --> 02:13.699
standards, and approving all new construction 
that goes on in the Woodlands. And the covenants

02:14.039 --> 02:19.607
say that the Woodlands Corporation would have 
control of the DSC, through 1992 to August of 1992.

02:24.381 --> 02:31.251
And then after that, it becomes a function of the 
WCA, which in 1992 becomes resident control.

02:32.072 --> 02:38.841
That's like creating a planning commission or a 
zoning board controlled by the residents. And

02:38.862 --> 02:49.797
then they could, if we were to continue the 
Woodlands Covenants on new properties, we would

02:38.862 --> 02:49.797
have to go to them and say, can we build this product 
again? You know, and that's just not workable.

02:56.269 --> 03:11.865
So while we wished the 1992 date were not in the 
covenants and that we could continue as we are now

02:56.269 --> 03:11.865
because it's working very well, and many 
residents have said to us, I wish we could continue

02:56.269 --> 03:11.865
because we like the involvement of the Women's 
Corporation. We think it adds stability. We think

03:13.106 --> 03:16.169
it adds quality. We're going to honor the 
provisions of the covenants and transfer of

03:19.831 --> 03:23.356
control of the board in 1992.

03:26.061 --> 03:31.389
That leaves a large area of the Woodlands under the 
WCA. We will create two new associations for the

03:32.230 --> 03:44.809
new areas of development, the residential 
association and the commercial association,

03:32.230 --> 03:44.809
which we will control until 85% of development. 
And we're not going to put a date certain in those

03:44.829 --> 03:46.933
covenants. We're not going to make the same 
mistake. And so what we have is we honor

03:50.577 --> 03:56.002
transition. We set up new associations. And then 
we and the elected directors who now serve on the

03:59.626 --> 04:09.896
WCA board have put our heads together and say, is it 
best to have three associations operating

03:59.626 --> 04:09.896
independently? Or is it better in some way to 
create a working relationship where we can

04:17.442 --> 04:23.508
achieve economies of scale and efficiencies of 
management. And by doing that, we all can benefit.

04:28.293 --> 04:30.395
The obvious answer is yes, that would be best. How 
could we do it? And we have come up with the notion of

04:32.578 --> 04:42.067
a services corporation to which the WCA staff 
would be transferred. And it would be...

04:44.982 --> 04:57.515
corporation, a nonprofit corporation that 
administers the affairs of all three

04:44.982 --> 04:57.515
associations,

04:44.982 --> 04:57.515
responding to the wishes of the respective boards 
of each association. So it's not an umbrella

04:57.535 --> 05:00.097
association. It's a services corporation that 
works under contract with each of the

05:00.277 --> 05:10.308
associations and takes its marching orders from 
the boards of each of the associations. That is

05:11.228 --> 05:13.791
what we have been presenting to the community. It 
is a hard concept for people to understand because

05:14.193 --> 05:24.326
they have always thought that the woodlands would 
be served by one association. Frankly, I think all

05:25.547 --> 05:34.959
of us have gotten so used to the one association 
that it's even hard for us to even contemplate

05:25.547 --> 05:34.959
setting up other associations. And if there is any

05:42.273 --> 05:45.316
or hesitancy on the part of the community. It's, 
why are you changing things? It's working so well.

05:51.221 --> 06:03.673
Well, we're changing it because we, as a 
developer, have to know that we can be responsive

05:51.221 --> 06:03.673
to market conditions. It's almost like what I 
described with HUD. That was a very difficult

06:06.555 --> 06:11.520
partnership, and if we allowed the DSC which would 
be resident-controlled,

06:12.378 --> 06:39.783
to be the throttle for new development, then we're 
not really having the freedom to make adjustments

06:12.378 --> 06:39.783
to the master plan as they need to be to change the 
product when the market says, you know, years ago

06:12.378 --> 06:39.783
we could build townhouses in the woodlands and 
sell them. You couldn't sell a townhouse today. So

06:41.825 --> 06:46.731
we've had to adjust our program. We will get back 
into townhouse development, I'm sure, but for the

06:46.792 --> 06:51.778
time being, we'll have to wait. And during the 
recession, you could not build apartments and

06:51.798 --> 06:56.605
rent them. The vacancy rate in apartments was 
tremendous. Well, the residents, some of the

07:00.470 --> 07:07.579
residents who are control-motivated don't fully 
appreciate that. what a developer has to do to

07:07.728 --> 07:12.894
respond to market conditions and so forth. And 
then you would have people coming and going on that

07:13.474 --> 07:37.701
development standards committee, whereas by 
creating the new associations, we set up the

07:13.474 --> 07:37.701
development standards committees within them, 
which we would control and have the continuity of

07:13.474 --> 07:37.701
the developer representation, have the 
professionalism of architects and engineers and

07:13.474 --> 07:37.701
developer type people on that committee. We're 
setting up the other association, but trying to

07:38.170 --> 07:56.106
keep, through the Services Corporation, the 
notion which we all like, that is the unity of the

07:38.170 --> 07:56.106
woodlands, the cohesiveness of the woodlands, 
and... And the continuity of the... Continuity of

07:38.170 --> 07:56.106
services. There'd still be one number to call if 
you need some help or have a question, and so forth.

08:04.013 --> 08:05.815
The proposal is getting... very good reception. 
It's taking people a long time to understand why we

08:08.860 --> 08:15.586
have to do this. And it's taking them time to 
understand that generally when they do, they call

08:15.606 --> 08:29.640
us or see them out on the streets and so forth, and 
they say, you know, we finally understand what

08:15.606 --> 08:29.640
you're trying to do, and it makes a lot of sense. 
There are a handful of people, and literally I

08:30.261 --> 08:35.886
would say no more than a dozen people, who have 
expressed vocal opposition to it. And out of

08:39.607 --> 08:46.915
30,000 people, you could expect some... What's 
the basis of their opposition? They think the

08:46.935 --> 08:52.602
developer is trying to wrest control from the WCA. 
They don't understand that the WCA board, which

08:53.383 --> 09:01.091
will be resident control, will be the authority 
for the WCA. It's somehow in their minds. They see

09:03.558 --> 09:08.827
the services corporation as being the 
controlling entity. It is not. It works at the

09:09.568 --> 09:19.164
behest of the board of the WCA or the board of WCA2, 
which is what we're calling it for lack of a name

09:09.568 --> 09:19.164
right now. And they don't fully understand the 
relationship. If you were to do an organizational

09:23.051 --> 09:28.941
chart, you would have the WCA board up here, And 
then you would have the Services Corporation as a

09:29.444 --> 09:42.483
really dotted line relationship to the board, 
beneath the board. It's not superior to the board.

09:45.367 --> 09:48.812
And that's where they really don't understand 
that. And what is your role in this transition?

09:52.337 --> 09:54.520
Guiding it and making sure that it happens. Your 
chief flag waver? Well, I'm one of the authors. of

09:59.397 --> 10:00.858
the transition proposal. We had a committee of 
four who conceived it, then brought it to the board

10:01.719 --> 10:14.790
of the association, which

10:01.719 --> 10:14.790
endorsed it. And now we're presenting it to the 
public, and presumably... Who were the other

10:15.390 --> 10:20.655
four? Well, of the three, Scott Cummings, who's 
the general manager of the WCA, Eric Wojnar, who

10:29.890 --> 10:36.644
works for the Women's Corporation, at that time 
was controller and serves as the treasurer of the

10:29.890 --> 10:36.644
WCA. And Brian Reed, who was the attorney for the 
WCA. Four of us conceived of this notion.

10:45.567 --> 10:53.554
presented it to the board, and the people who 
really have to buy off on it are the four resident

10:45.567 --> 10:53.554
elected directors of the WCA. The WCA has four of 
11, seven of whom are appointed by the Women's

10:53.634 --> 11:00.681
Corporation, four of whom are elected by the 
community. So what it came to was those four had to

11:01.802 --> 11:14.173
agree to it, and there were some substantial 
negotiations between the elected directors and

11:01.802 --> 11:14.173
the Women's Corporation. Their biggest concern 
was if you stop the growth of the WCA, you freeze its

11:14.609 --> 11:28.302
tax base, much the way a city's tax base would be 
frozen if it could not annex. And they wanted to

11:29.222 --> 11:34.147
annex the rest of the property. And we explored 
that. But it wouldn't work because it would

11:35.949 --> 11:41.734
undermine the economic viability of the second 
association. So we said, well, how can we? let you,

11:43.735 --> 11:52.629
the WCA, benefit from that growth but not annex 
those properties. And what we came up with was a

11:52.649 --> 12:02.385
mechanism for sharing in certain costs of the WCA. 
by the other associations who implicitly built in

12:03.395 --> 12:08.041
a bit of a subsidy. So there is cash flowing from the 
other associations into the WCA to, in effect,

12:08.061 --> 12:15.351
subsidize. It was a little bit complicated. But 
that lowers the tax bite also. But it would lower

12:18.915 --> 12:21.959
the tax bite of this. From what you said, I gathered 
that the 1992 was a, I mean, there's no argument

12:23.121 --> 12:27.667
with that. That was in the covenants. It was a 
got-to-do. That's right. What other issues

12:30.997 --> 12:41.329
entered into your minds as you formulated this 
solution to that covenant? What were the things

12:42.791 --> 12:47.536
that you kicked around before you came up with this 
idea? Well, we had some objectives which we

12:47.556 --> 12:58.069
presented to the board four years ago. We said... 
This is why it's important to the Woodlands

12:59.521 --> 13:01.805
Corporation. I'll see if I can remember that we 
said that. We wanted whatever arrangement we came

13:04.430 --> 13:13.005
up with, we wanted the quality of services to be 
maintained. We wanted the quality of facilities

13:13.025 --> 13:17.814
to be maintained. We felt that an objective would 
be to lower the assessment rate We said that we, the

13:25.525 --> 13:35.754
development corporation, needed to be in control 
of planning and development. And there was one or

13:35.774 --> 13:36.975
two others. And these sound very altruistic, but 
we've been altruistic for 16 years. And we

13:42.580 --> 13:45.162
presented those to the elected directors. And 
they said, gee, that sounds great. We agree with

13:47.184 --> 13:48.005
that. Now, how do we translate that into a plan of 
action? That's what we worked for four years on.

13:53.970 --> 13:55.431
And we came up with this. And so those were the 
guiding principles, then? Those were the guiding

14:00.449 --> 14:02.431
principles. Have there been any basic tensions 
between the residents, say, and the population

14:02.451 --> 14:17.224
over the past years that are also involved, other 
than the expansion issue and the tax base, I guess,

14:02.451 --> 14:17.224
issue? There have been issues from time to time 
that have produced tension. In the early years,

14:27.524 --> 14:38.580
The Woodlands Corporation people, not knowing 
anything about community management, made a

14:27.524 --> 14:38.580
mistake that so many developers still make. And I 
lecture about this at the national conferences of

14:38.660 --> 14:50.317
community associations and to developers. When 
you take fiduciary responsibility of an

14:54.085 --> 15:17.477
association when you are the trustee of an 
association you have a responsibility to the

14:54.085 --> 15:17.477
residents like it or not that association is not 
your business it is a private nonprofit

14:54.085 --> 15:17.477
corporation that you for a time being have been 
entrusted to manage well And most developers

15:17.761 --> 15:22.446
don't realize that, particularly if they're 
doing it for the first time. In the early years, the

15:23.247 --> 15:29.754
Women's Corporation held the WCM meetings in 
somebody's office in this building. And the

15:29.774 --> 15:31.917
residents are saying, that's our association. We 
are members. The Covenant's established us as

15:32.698 --> 15:35.120
members of the association. We don't know what's 
going on. Well, that got the Women's Corporation

15:37.503 --> 15:42.408
and the residents off on the wrong foot. I mean, it 
really did in that last years. suspicion

15:47.073 --> 15:57.848
developed that,

15:47.073 --> 15:57.848
well, a distrust between the company and the 
residents. So they started holding public

15:58.349 --> 16:01.192
meetings. But the manner in which those meetings 
were held only inflamed those suspicions.

16:12.233 --> 16:22.749
The president and the board tended to like to call 
the majority he had on the board on all votes. So it

16:22.769 --> 16:31.122
was clearly a rubber stamp situation, even when I 
first got on the board in 77. And the residents just

16:31.142 --> 16:38.032
resented that, and I personally think for good 
reason. Also, some of the tensions were

16:38.052 --> 16:41.177
heightened by the fact that The residents only had 
one representative on board. The board at that

16:45.807 --> 16:48.369
time, I think, was seven. And it has grown. It was 
eight. Yeah, I think seven developer appointed

16:51.953 --> 16:57.680
and one resident elected. So the development 
corporation, over time,

16:58.020 --> 17:10.033
began to see that it needed to change its style. And 
in response to requests from the community, which

17:10.925 --> 17:28.467
were militant requests, added resident elected 
people to the board even before the covenants

17:10.925 --> 17:28.467
required them to be added. And in some case, we gave 
up our seats. to enable that to happen in fact today

17:33.318 --> 17:59.089
one of our seats is held by a resident elected 
director we should have eight seats we only have

17:33.318 --> 17:59.089
seven because we gave up one seat

17:33.318 --> 17:59.089
so those are some of the tensions in the early years 
and when i took over the presidency of the board

17:33.318 --> 17:59.089
which i've had for 10 years my objectives were to 
eliminate those tensions and establish a

18:00.335 --> 18:04.961
partnership. I changed the mode of operating the 
board and I have encouraged even our own appointed

18:04.981 --> 18:24.148
people with the responsibility of the trust that 
has been given to them for proper management of the

18:04.981 --> 18:24.148
association. to speak out as the professionals 
that they are. And if they don't agree with

18:27.823 --> 18:31.094
something, I want to hear that. And we've made it a 
much stronger association as a result a couple of

18:31.736 --> 18:36.332
years ago. We were named the best managed large 
scale association in the Houston area and hope to

18:36.650 --> 18:46.261
win that award this year at the national level. 
They've just established a competition that I

18:46.281 --> 18:53.510
think will certainly come in the top two or three if 
not winning. And that's because I like to use the

18:54.331 --> 19:01.079
talents I have available to me and foolish not to. 
Other tensions tend to crop up. between the

19:04.342 --> 19:07.511
community and the Women's Corporation on 
specific issues.

19:10.920 --> 19:16.174
Most of them have to do

19:10.920 --> 19:16.174
with, well, I shouldn't say I mean, there have been 
some issues where I think the community felt we

19:16.407 --> 19:30.900
were not protecting the standards of development 
as much as we should, such as one was when our first

19:16.407 --> 19:30.900
gas station was proposed for the Woodlands. I 
think it's an Exxon station. They were going to cut

19:32.721 --> 19:40.028
a driveway directly onto Grosvenor Road, which 
would have been taking trees down and having them

19:32.721 --> 19:40.028
cleaned up. And the community virtually chained 
themselves in front of the bulldozers. And they

19:43.471 --> 19:46.313
could go quite to that, but it was close to that. And 
so we asked Exxon if they would change their plan,

19:47.086 --> 19:51.732
and they said okay. Exxon didn't want to do it 
because it would cost them money, but they agreed

19:52.273 --> 19:57.460
because of the opposition. And last I heard, that 
was the largest bro-sink gas station in the

19:58.401 --> 20:08.495
Houston area without a direct curb cutout to 
Grover's Mill. They've objected to signs,

20:09.076 --> 20:15.625
certain types of signs that were proposed to be put 
in. These are things that usually get resolved

20:16.600 --> 20:19.944
amicably. But those are good kind of objections, 
too. What you're saying is the residents care very

20:21.847 --> 20:25.631
deeply about the community. That's right. It's 
basically supportive of the whole framework.

20:28.595 --> 20:29.756
Yeah, that's right. We had a major controversy 
when we built and filled Lake Woodlands. The

20:36.024 --> 20:40.570
community felt that they were not going to have 
enough access to the lake, and that became a big

20:36.024 --> 20:40.570
issue. So we adjusted our plans to get more points 
of access to the lake. Again, a feeling of this is

20:46.537 --> 20:54.190
our community, and we want to be part of it. We don't 
want to. And, you know, some of this is good. Last

20:58.919 --> 21:09.557
year, or earlier this year, just outside of the 
developed areas, some of the people who owned the

20:58.919 --> 21:09.557
mineral rights kind of drilled a gas well. We try to 
buy up all the mineral rights, mainly to prevent

21:10.718 --> 21:21.637
wells from being driven nearby or even in 
developed areas. Had we controlled all the

21:21.797 --> 21:26.045
mineral rights, that well never would have been 
built. But we didn't, so under state law you have to

21:26.065 --> 21:28.930
allow them. To drill it, we put in conditions in the 
contract. Thus, we controlled

21:36.073 --> 21:48.023
enough of the mineral rights and the surface 
rights to use quiet generators and things like

21:36.073 --> 21:48.023
that. But the community was just upset that there 
would be an oil well or a gas well, as it turned out,

21:48.043 --> 21:56.430
being drilled within eye contact of existing 
homes. And it had gotten noisy at times. Yeah,

21:58.897 --> 22:07.310
we caught the flak very directly. But that's 
something that we could not stop, although we

22:07.611 --> 22:14.802
tried to dissuade people from doing it. So it tends 
to be single-issue, single-issue oriented, and

22:14.822 --> 22:24.617
those issues come and go, and we almost always...

22:26.048 --> 22:34.619
and Women's Community Association takes over, 
will that sort of diminish some of your problems,

22:26.048 --> 22:34.619
maybe, or create new ones? Do you see any different 
direction that that group may pursue in terms of

22:35.420 --> 22:40.868
what their goals are? Well, I see a board

22:42.009 --> 22:51.742
that will have, when it starts out, ten elected and 
one appointed person. We still have one residual

22:51.762 --> 22:54.165
person on the board. Because it's predominantly 
elected and controlled by those people becoming

22:54.854 --> 23:14.965
very political, I think it will become political 
internal to the board, but I think it will also

22:54.854 --> 23:14.965
become much more political within the community 
and vis-a-vis the developing corporation. I see

23:14.985 --> 23:18.030
seats being heavily contested. I see a lot of 
what's going on. in public politics now happening

23:22.057 --> 23:26.803
on the board. And I think that board will make the 
United Times become militant vis-a-vis the

23:26.863 --> 23:33.711
Development Corporation. So you see that as a 
divisive, or potentially divisive? Could be,

23:39.998 --> 23:42.902
yeah. Now, we have tried to be responsive. We sit 
down with whatever community group has a problem.

23:50.710 --> 23:53.815
I can't tell you the hours we put into that. Not only 
myself, that's my job, but all the executives in

23:54.215 --> 23:59.263
this company. If there's somebody in the 
community that wants an audience, give them the

23:59.283 --> 24:03.469
audience. I just think that because the WCA board 
will have people actively vying for those seats,

24:03.489 --> 24:17.190
and some of them will be running negative 
campaigns, They'll have campaign pledges that

24:18.031 --> 24:21.615
they'll have to keep. And from time to time, we've 
had some very negative people on the board, and it

24:22.495 --> 24:30.503
was hard dealing with them. People will use the WCA 
as a springboard to other political offices. We

24:37.550 --> 24:42.395
had one fellow who wanted to run for Congress. He 
wasn't known in the community, so he ran for the WCA

24:42.415 --> 24:46.519
board. He found Rob Lapp had done something wrong 
in carrying out the elections and ran against Rob

24:47.360 --> 25:04.884
Lapp, saying he's trying to prevent fair 
elections. This guy got the largest number of

25:05.805 --> 25:13.015
votes that were ever cast in a WCA election before 
or since. He won hands down. And then Rob left

25:16.705 --> 25:20.249
shortly thereafter. I was the one who had to work 
with him. And he said to me, he said, I'm using the

25:23.532 --> 25:29.698
WCA as my stepping stone to run for Congress. I'll 
get name recognition. And he said, I'm going to do

25:32.200 --> 25:34.122
some things you're not going to like. But he said, I 
got to do them. And sure enough, within a couple of

25:35.944 --> 25:42.831
years he was on the board, he kept us off balance all 
the time. issue after issue. He was in the

25:44.616 --> 25:46.218
newspapers all the time. And, you know, we'd have 
lunch, and he'd say, you know, I hate to do this to

25:47.240 --> 25:52.250
you because I like you. I said, I'm running for 
Congress. So that's not going to end. No, that's

25:56.557 --> 25:57.559
going to increase. I think it's going to increase. 
I think we're going to see that kind of dynamic

25:58.701 --> 26:02.769
happening. So you've got a job there. What about, 
speaking of tensions, I don't know if this is a good

26:07.263 --> 26:10.847
time. Do you want to take a break or something? 
That's fine. Please do. What about the tensions,

26:16.254 --> 26:19.458
say, with the county? I know you said the 
Montgomery County problems and High Road

26:20.259 --> 26:26.807
problems and this kind of thing. Can you comment on 
that? Yeah. And maybe even use the broader

26:30.111 --> 26:31.733
context. Well, no. Let me go at a national level. 
All right. As a student of Newtown's. When you

26:38.397 --> 26:57.404
build a new town, with the exception of Roosevelt 
Island, which is probably the only one built

26:38.397 --> 26:57.404
inside the city, in order to amass the land, you've 
got to go far out where land is plentiful and cheap.

27:00.128 --> 27:06.818
And so what you're doing is you're introducing an 
urban population into a rural area. That's point

27:07.439 --> 27:12.186
number

27:07.439 --> 27:12.186
one. There are lifestyle differences that the 
rural people don't really appreciate. Number

27:20.137 --> 27:32.995
two, you're introducing a large population

27:20.137 --> 27:32.995
into a county that generally has a relatively 
small population.

27:33.015 --> 27:36.079
That does several things. It places demands on 
services and county government and the school and

27:37.139 --> 27:56.024
hospital district or whatever other public 
entities there are, notwithstanding the fact

27:37.139 --> 27:56.024
that you're bringing in a concomitant tax base, 
particularly if it's a mixed-use development.

27:56.044 --> 28:00.550
The woman's more than pays its way in taxes and 
generates. But you're taking institutions that

28:00.570 --> 28:06.117
haven't had to gear up very much, and putting 
pressures on them. You're also, by introducing a

28:10.632 --> 28:19.302
large population into an area, threatening the 
political structure. And you're bringing voters

28:19.322 --> 28:25.529
in, voters who have no past allegiance to anybody 
who's held office. We have, for example, a county

28:26.189 --> 28:33.117
clerk who's held office for 26 years. who's now 
having to campaign. He's never had to campaign

28:36.502 --> 28:39.467
before. Okay, so there is a perceived threat to the 
established political order. And, in fact,

28:47.540 --> 28:55.412
there's a real threat because these people are, 
you know, they have achieved their positions.

28:57.315 --> 28:58.918
They have become known. And if you take the kind of 
growth that the women's represents, you know,

29:00.130 --> 29:15.564
30,000 people in 16 years, which is equal to, you 
know, Conroe 16 years ago had 7,500 people.

29:15.584 --> 29:27.515
The new people aren't going to vote without any 
real knowledge of who's who and what their records

29:15.584 --> 29:27.515
have been, what their achievements have been, 
good, bad, or otherwise. So it's a real threat.

29:29.915 --> 29:44.213
Every new town that I'm aware of has met with 
hostility in the county and the nearest town that

29:29.915 --> 29:44.213
is approximate to the new town. It's a phenomenon. 
I mean, to this day, you can go to Columbia,

29:45.274 --> 29:59.432
Maryland, and pick up the newspaper, and you have 
the Columbians and the Howard County people still

29:45.274 --> 29:59.432
battling heads-on in the newspapers. 
Politically, taking over the county,

29:59.868 --> 30:12.322
all of the elected offices, the majority of them 
are held by political people from Columbia. That

30:12.622 --> 30:14.384
dynamic happened here. And there are resentments 
between Conroe and the Woodlands, the rest of the

30:14.524 --> 30:25.976
county and the Woodlands. And no matter what we do, 
we can't overcome it. And frankly, given the

30:29.416 --> 30:35.562
history of the other new towns, I'm not sure that we 
ever will. Until Conroe urbanizes enough itself

30:36.023 --> 30:43.050
with new people that they don't carry the old 
biases. But that's, at best, a long time in time.

30:48.475 --> 30:49.677
We've worked closely with them. We've worked 
professionally with them. And the senior manager

30:52.480 --> 30:58.866
of this company volunteers a lot of time on the 
boards charities up there. I can't tell you how

31:02.475 --> 31:06.441
many boards of directors I serve on them. I can't 
tell you because I'm not sure I know. I think it's

31:08.163 --> 31:09.225
six or eight. And I spend hours. And on a 
one-on-one, one-to-one, it's great. Joel and Joe

31:17.598 --> 31:20.282
get along great. But institutionally, there's 
always a distance. What about the relationship

31:27.247 --> 31:32.233
with Houston and the city itself? Does the 
Woodlands even fit into the purview of Houston?

31:36.378 --> 31:45.570
Well, we are by choice, by our own initiative, in 
the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city of

31:36.378 --> 31:45.570
Houston. And that is because it is Mr. Mitchell's 
objective that at some point in time, Houston will

31:45.590 --> 31:56.443
annex the Woodlands. that we will not be a 
freestanding, incorporated community. Now

32:04.217 --> 32:06.119
that's one of the tensions. That's an issue that 
pops up about every three or four years. People

32:11.906 --> 32:12.707
look at it. They don't do anything about it. But I 
think as Houston starts to annex Northwood,

32:14.409 --> 32:23.781
that's going to become perhaps the major issue in 
the history of the Woodlands. I think we're just

32:24.605 --> 32:31.631
buying time right now. You know, the reason for 
wanting to be part of Houston has to do with what

32:31.731 --> 32:49.926
you're seeing as the older cities getting 
financially choked by the surrounding suburban

32:31.731 --> 32:49.926
cities. And he feels as from an urban uh growth 
standpoint but cities have to expand their their

32:55.165 --> 33:20.937
tax base that's in effect what we did with the wca 
good we've given the wca claims to some of the

32:55.165 --> 33:20.937
revenue streams on the new associations and 
frankly as a guy who has studied

32:55.165 --> 33:20.937
this a lot in school and since somehow I think if 
there's a reconciliation that will take place

33:21.862 --> 33:44.950
between the suburban areas not wanting to be 
incorporated, I'm sorry, not wanting to be

33:21.862 --> 33:44.950
annexed by Houston, but Houston having a need to 
expand its economic base, it would be to find, work

33:21.862 --> 33:44.950
out some economic relationship, sharing of the 
tax base that's represented in suburbia with the

33:45.335 --> 33:57.729
central city, but yet letting suburbia have 
political autonomy. Has that happened here? Oh

33:59.752 --> 34:01.554
yeah, all over the country. It's called 
metropolitan government. I can't name them all,

34:06.079 --> 34:11.325
but the ones I'm familiar with are Miami-Dade 
County, That issue's going on with Webster,

34:11.812 --> 34:16.819
Clinton, and all the weird stuff. Sure it is. 
Minneapolis, St. Paul is one of the Metropolitan

34:19.743 --> 34:23.488
Government. Phoenix has Metropolitan 
Government. And these take various forms.

34:29.536 --> 34:32.320
Some of them are strictly economic. In some cases, 
Metropolitan Government actually elects a

34:32.380 --> 34:38.609
council and carries out certain things. But from 
my standpoint, if you look at transportation, If

34:42.001 --> 34:53.500
you look at subsidence, if you look at sewage 
treatment, if you look at water, those are foreign

34:42.001 --> 34:53.500
examples. Those can all be and probably should be 
administered at a metropolitan

34:54.201 --> 35:02.895
scope. through not individual cities or 
individual communities. What about other

35:07.563 --> 35:09.626
services like police, fire? Police and fire in 
schools are held very close to the hearts of local

35:10.707 --> 35:23.383
communities and ought to be administered 
locally. The characteristics of the different

35:23.403 --> 35:32.815
communities probably can even justify different 
approaches to those things. Those are the three

35:33.284 --> 35:43.334
things that I would say, above all, ought to be 
retained at the local level. And those are things

35:43.354 --> 35:53.284
that require a lot of interaction between the 
community and whoever's delivering those

35:43.354 --> 35:53.284
services. And those services, those delivery 
agents, have to be responsive to the local

35:53.624 --> 35:58.549
communities. I think those ought to be local 
derivatives. But frankly, I don't care who treats

36:04.341 --> 36:19.719
the waste that leaves my house, be it through the 
sewer system or garbage collection. And that's a

36:19.739 --> 36:24.745
very simplistic way of looking at it. But if it's a 
metropolitan organization or a local one,

36:29.866 --> 36:31.669
doesn't matter to me as a resident. I just want the 
stuff taken care of.

36:40.122 --> 36:49.116
But I do care an awful lot about the education my 
kids get, and I want to have direct input into that.

36:49.136 --> 36:53.983
And I'm saying me, but I'm also reflecting what I 
think because we've talked a lot about this among

36:54.250 --> 37:04.003
the leadership of the community, I think it 
reflects the general populace. There are certain

37:04.023 --> 37:08.549
things they could care less about who runs them, 
and there's some things they care a lot about. So if

37:08.569 --> 37:20.865
we were to have, and what I'm saying is heresy 
because it's company policy to have Houston annex

37:08.569 --> 37:20.865
the Woodlands, and I think certainly from

37:21.520 --> 37:37.078
an economic viewpoint, that is needed.

37:37.098 --> 37:48.792
But if, what I'm saying is, if there becomes a 
standoff, if the suburban areas

37:37.098 --> 37:48.792
prevent that from happening, then I think that 
we're in compromised positions where both can

37:37.098 --> 37:48.792
benefit. And it doesn't need to be all or nothing. 
And it would perhaps behoove some people to even

37:49.653 --> 37:51.375
begin thinking about that long range. I assume 
that people have done surveys, studies, what have

37:51.727 --> 37:59.397
you, to identify stuff like that. Or are you just 
talking off of your own experience? I'm talking

38:01.880 --> 38:05.024
off my own experience. Again, this is such a 
sensitive issue on both sides that I'm not sure

38:05.044 --> 38:18.561
that anybody would be willing to venture to do the 
study because it would raise the issue. Well, I'm

38:20.279 --> 38:33.396
not sure

38:20.279 --> 38:33.396
there's an issue. I'm not aware of any issue. Well, 
the MUDs are created initially by the developer.

38:42.487 --> 38:49.155
Any developer can create a mud in Texas to provide 
water, sewage, drainage. It's what we did here in

38:49.675 --> 38:53.540
the Woodlands with them. And the mud has the 
authority to issue bonds to pay for that once

38:53.800 --> 39:06.835
you've built up enough of a population, enough of a 
tax base to pay the debt service on that. So the

39:06.955 --> 39:10.840
developer front ends the financing. takes a note 
back, in effect, from the developer, builds the

39:11.242 --> 39:29.183
facilities, the sewage lines, water lines, 
sewage

39:11.242 --> 39:29.183
treatment plants, and so forth. And the board of 
the MoD agrees to pay that back according to a

39:31.806 --> 39:37.873
state-allowed formula.

39:40.452 --> 39:41.814
And they work very well. The next district, the 
Independent Taxing Institute, they would have

39:41.834 --> 39:48.824
nothing to do technically with the community 
association. That's correct. That's correct.

39:50.066 --> 39:51.228
Those are special. Along with the county. That's 
correct. That's correct. The plans have to be

39:55.133 --> 39:58.939
approved by the city of Houston, because that's 
where we're in. It's ETJ. I believe they're

40:00.742 --> 40:04.427
approved by Montgomery County, but I'm not. 
Certain types of districts are, and certain

40:04.447 --> 40:08.814
aren't. I shouldn't say that. I know certain types 
of districts are. I'm not sure of all of them are. I

40:13.647 --> 40:19.493
think all the meds have to be approved by the county 
and the Texas Water Commission. But there are

40:19.513 --> 40:25.940
special purpose units of government that are 
allowed under state law. And they're a convenient

40:25.960 --> 40:37.493
and effective way of getting those services into a 
development and used throughout suburbia. So

40:38.013 --> 40:46.202
will the mud presently serviced in the woodlands 
here be extended into the new development areas or

40:38.013 --> 40:46.202
whatever? We create muds as we go along, and I think 
we have eight muds today. Oh, do you really? Each

40:52.449 --> 40:56.934
time we go into a major new area, we create a mud. And 
we also, and the muds in turn, have a contract with

40:57.354 --> 41:04.442
the San Jacinto River Authority, which is 
responsible for the water plants and sewage

41:05.131 --> 41:09.721
treatment plants, and the major distribution 
lines. So because of the scope, we needed an

41:09.901 --> 41:16.896
umbrella agency. And in fact, what gave me the 
notion for the multiple associations with for the

41:25.415 --> 41:28.298
community associations and the services corps. 
Really, it's the way the MUDs are working. They're

41:30.199 --> 41:33.983
doing that now, and it's working just fine. Oh, is 
that right? Sure. That's right. We've got eight

41:35.804 --> 41:36.805
MUDs. We've got San Jacinto River, and they all 
come together in what's called the Joint Powers

41:36.825 --> 41:47.515
Agency, which is a management services 
corporation which manages the affairs of all the

41:36.825 --> 41:47.515
MUDs. And we just borrowed that. We said it would 
work there with the associations. And also, I

41:53.200 --> 41:55.202
mean, I'm aware from my work with the Community 
Associations Institute, that wherever you have

41:55.688 --> 42:13.705
multiple associations, there's generally some 
sort of common organization to help them manage

41:55.688 --> 42:13.705
their affairs, even if they're not created at the 
outset. They become created because there's

42:14.706 --> 42:22.974
a manifest need to do that. And I think we've got off 
to months. pretty straightforward.

42:29.309 --> 42:47.560
You mentioned the

42:29.309 --> 42:47.560
political issues with Houston, obviously the 
further

42:29.309 --> 42:47.560
community development and

42:29.309 --> 42:47.560
management. Are there other issues that you 
perceive in the future that are going to cause you

42:53.502 --> 42:57.406
more late-night meetings that you haven't 
mentioned? Not that they're bad, necessarily,

42:57.426 --> 43:03.893
but I mean, you know, are there issues out there 
that we haven't talked about that you perceive? I

43:05.054 --> 43:10.119
don't see any extraordinary issues coming up. I'm 
sure we'll have issues from time to time,

43:10.279 --> 43:21.130
but I really don't see it. Despite the tensions 
we've talked about, within the realm of my

43:22.325 --> 43:42.286
exposure, the Woodlands Corporation and the 
Woodlands community enjoy probably the best

43:22.325 --> 43:42.286
relationship among a developer and a community 
that I'm aware of. No, that's obvious. And my

43:43.047 --> 43:51.336
general manager of the WCA, Scott Cummings, 
recently attended a workshop among his

43:43.047 --> 43:51.336
counterparts managers of community 
associations and large-scale developments. And

43:57.196 --> 44:02.384
he said he wouldn't believe the horror

43:57.196 --> 44:02.384
stories that he hears. And we're talking about 
mature communities, large-scale, like Irvine,

44:03.085 --> 44:13.522
California. The developer and the communities 
are loggerheads all the time. And I think But

44:19.193 --> 44:31.268
that's because the developer doesn't respect the 
community, doesn't recognize that working with

44:19.193 --> 44:31.268
the community is part of the development process. 
Too many developers are in the bricks and mortar

44:32.149 --> 44:34.933
business. Even if they get themselves good 
planners and architects, they don't want to deal

44:36.996 --> 44:41.862
with the residents. And if you're in a project over 
an extended period of time, Brother, you better

44:47.307 --> 44:51.411
deal with it. If for no other reason, then they can 
make or break a project.

44:58.900 --> 45:12.555
On the average, over the years, 50% of the home 
sales in the Woodlands have come from referrals

44:58.900 --> 45:12.555
from Woodlands

44:58.900 --> 45:12.555
residents. It tends to range from 40% to 60%, 
depending on... year-to-year market conditions

45:16.012 --> 45:18.535
and whatever. But if keeping our residents happy

45:19.476 --> 45:31.130
is good business, folks, we're going to keep them 
happy. And if not entertaining them all the time,

45:31.150 --> 45:34.835
at least keeping them content. And this is another 
thing I try to hit home when I'm lecturing to

45:35.936 --> 45:41.263
developers. It's good business. Now, some 
developers are in and out of a project in two or

45:43.079 --> 45:47.725
three years, and it doesn't matter. But when 
you're dealing with large-scale developments

45:47.745 --> 45:59.720
that are being developed from seven to ten years or 
longer, you want to make sure that your residents

45:47.745 --> 45:59.720
are happy. So you anticipate the relationship 
between the Woodlands Corporation and the

45:59.740 --> 46:07.970
Woodlands R.A. relationship continuing for the 
next, what, two decades? Longer than that, as long

46:08.491 --> 46:10.774
as we're developing. As long as we're in here 
developing, I think our residential development

46:11.648 --> 46:21.762
will probably wind down in about 25 years or so. And 
then it'll be less critical. At that point, we will

46:24.126 --> 46:29.814
have turned the other associations, at least the 
residential ones, over to the community. And our

46:30.615 --> 46:36.283
commercial development will probably continue 
on beyond that. We have a lot of commercial land.

46:37.214 --> 46:48.473
But as long as we're out there developing, we're 
going to hopefully, you know—and I've got to say

46:37.214 --> 46:48.473
that we have enlightened management. As the 
management turns, it's inevitably going to turn

46:48.493 --> 46:59.070
over two or three decades. It's probably a good 
time. Give us some sort of an overview, both from a

47:02.088 --> 47:09.442
personal and professional perspective, of how 
the witness is involved. Has it met your

47:09.462 --> 47:10.647
expectations?
