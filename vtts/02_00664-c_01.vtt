WEBVTT

00:14.392 --> 00:15.013
Is it running? It is running. Oh.

00:19.700 --> 00:24.407
This is Alan Vines. I want to start in or continue 
working on the period in which I was spending half

00:24.427 --> 00:39.049
time in Washington and half time in Woods Hole.

00:44.058 --> 01:04.999
The advent of

00:44.058 --> 01:04.999
better instrumentation and of more laboratories 
getting involved in oceanography

00:44.058 --> 01:04.999
was very important.

01:08.563 --> 01:13.828
Along about this time, Scripps got the RV Horizon. 
so they could start making expeditions

01:14.500 --> 01:23.732
with really a much better capability than 
Atlantis was ever able to. By this, they had a

01:25.274 --> 01:33.864
better choice of where they could go, how much they 
could carry, and so forth.

01:42.876 --> 01:43.917
All of the Of course, from where I sat in the working 
with the Bureau of Ships administering the

01:45.398 --> 02:15.034
laboratories, it seemed to me that the 
laboratories operated together and on a somewhat

01:45.398 --> 02:15.034
more

01:45.398 --> 02:15.034
centralized, not centralized plan, but the 
coordination was, it probably appeared better to

01:45.398 --> 02:15.034
me than it did to many other people because So much 
of it was being operated out of our desk. At that

02:22.357 --> 02:32.132
time, I would presume the budgets at Woods Hole 
were probably 80% from the Bureau of Ships. And at

02:32.632 --> 02:45.291
Scripps, which had a great deal more state 
financing, it was probably lower and down around

02:32.632 --> 02:45.291
60%.

02:46.722 --> 02:47.503
possibly 50%.

02:52.387 --> 03:14.367
During this period in the Woods Hole work, in our 
acoustic section, we were very heavily involved

02:52.387 --> 03:14.367
with

02:52.387 --> 03:14.367
convergent zone sonar and operated about

03:15.798 --> 03:19.021
five major tests a year. Brackett Hersey was in the 
acoustics work. Brackett Hersey was my boss at

03:25.468 --> 03:28.952
Woods Hole. He had taken over the acoustics and was 
chiefly responsible for the, deserves the

03:29.172 --> 03:43.307
principal credit for the high quality of 
acoustics work. trying to keep it much more

03:43.810 --> 03:48.855
quantitative, certainly, than I ever would have. 
Because I was more interested in the area,

03:50.076 --> 03:56.843
oceanographic aspects of the business. And 
Hersey was more interested

03:57.945 --> 04:10.037
and involved in maintaining better acoustic 
measurements and keeping information data that

04:10.743 --> 04:16.769
we got more creditable in the eyes of professional 
acousticians. That doesn't mean that either one

04:18.991 --> 04:29.781
of us were negligent of the other aspects of it, but 
that tended to be somewhat of an automatic

04:18.991 --> 04:29.781
division of labor.

04:34.365 --> 04:39.450
During this time, Islin was following the work 
very closely advice, kibitzing, and helping us

04:40.358 --> 04:53.759
out on a little bit better general interpretation 
of how the ocean worked. Also during this time, the

04:53.779 --> 05:07.800
Ewing and Warzel at the Lamont Laboratory, excuse 
me, at the Columbia Laboratory,

05:11.392 --> 05:20.021
heavily involved in the transmission problem 
largely as it came out of geophysics. And both

05:21.343 --> 05:35.158
Columbia and Woods Hole, largely through Hersey, 
were heavily involved in doing acoustical

05:21.343 --> 05:35.158
seismic tests and measurements. Most of this was 
between the United States and the Mid-Atlantic

05:40.417 --> 05:46.244
Ridge, because that was all the capability we had 
with our ships.

05:50.349 --> 05:59.980
At that time, most of the seismic operations were 
two-ship operations involving one ship for

05:50.349 --> 05:59.980
shooting and one ship for receiving.

06:01.762 --> 06:10.272
So the general attitude was to take Atlantis and 
whatever other ship we could get, and then as we

06:10.555 --> 06:20.243
acquired more smaller ships, such as the Bear and 
Karen, we had a wider variety of ships. But smaller

06:20.384 --> 06:28.130
ones were confined largely within the Great 
American Bight that is only out to Bermuda.

06:31.653 --> 06:39.280
One word about the kinds of ships that were small 
ships that were used then. Heaven knows they were

06:41.032 --> 06:45.817
as good as many of the boats that fishermen used. So 
from that standpoint, we weren't badly abused.

06:51.283 --> 06:57.070
But they were fairly small, running from 60 to 90 
feet. The amount of space on them was marginal,

06:58.491 --> 07:05.980
very marginal, from the standpoint of getting any 
reasonable amount of equipment aboard. Those

07:06.040 --> 07:08.963
that were sailing ships had booms and masts and 
stays in so many of the wrong places that they

07:09.871 --> 07:15.976
couldn't be used very efficiently. And

07:17.918 --> 07:31.950
while most of them were safe enough as far as 
getting back, the weather didn't have to get very

07:17.918 --> 07:31.950
heavy, but they got to where it was just plain 
impossible to continue the work. So the

07:32.131 --> 07:35.453
efficiency of these ships was not very high. And it 
is One of the reasons why, along about this time, I

07:38.930 --> 07:48.783
began to think much more that really the ship is the 
principal instrument. And it was going to be

07:50.505 --> 07:55.010
pretty hard for us to do better work than the ship 
was capable of. So I started spending much more

07:56.973 --> 08:08.768
time in the general concept of how can we improve 
ships, and how can we go about getting better ones.

08:11.607 --> 08:26.111
Didn't have to be very smart to do this because 
after you beat your brains out on inferior ships at

08:11.607 --> 08:26.111
sea, it looks like it's no good long-term solution 
for either you or the future of the game.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.207
By this time it was The general picture of the 
geology of the ocean was beginning to open up a good

08:38.768 --> 08:52.283
deal, the fact that there was a big lack of 
sediments in the ocean.

08:55.527 --> 09:07.020
The group at Columbia was the ringleader in this, 
but it was becoming apparent from work that many

08:55.527 --> 09:07.020
people were doing.

09:11.557 --> 09:25.392
ONR was moving along, picking up funding, and 
particularly the physical oceanography and

09:11.557 --> 09:25.392
biological end was doing very much more. But they 
were quite slow in working and financing problems

09:27.074 --> 09:33.180
on instrumentation. This tended to remain more in 
the Bureau of Ships budget

09:42.792 --> 09:49.461
10 or 15 years later in the history of 
oceanography, ONR was carrying the burden in

09:42.792 --> 09:49.461
instrumentation. And NSF was only hiring people 
or paying for ships. At the present time, it's

09:56.311 --> 10:00.817
getting to where nobody wants to pay for advanced 
instrumentation. And it is perhaps one reason

10:00.977 --> 10:11.652
why, at the moment, we may be on a little bit more of a 
technological plateau than is good for the

10:00.977 --> 10:11.652
science.

10:16.019 --> 10:26.653
Washington

10:16.019 --> 10:26.653
was, as always, I suppose, organizing into 
committees. There was a

10:26.833 --> 10:33.481
group established. I can't think of their name 
right now. In the oceanographic section, Dr.

10:36.485 --> 10:44.035
Redfield was the head of it, was the chairman of it. 
They held meetings around the country with

10:44.605 --> 10:54.299
representatives from the laboratories, trying 
to put a little more coherence into the

10:44.605 --> 10:54.299
oceanographic plans. This committee by itself 
did not really do a great deal of good, but it was

10:56.062 --> 11:12.165
useful in helping all laboratories get together 
and focus a little bit more communication between

11:12.888 --> 11:14.571
labs. And then, as it turned out, when the Korean 
War started, there was a little bit of a structure

11:15.312 --> 11:25.448
so that people knew who to talk to. There was a 
format in which advice could be sent around in a

11:25.489 --> 11:30.837
semi-official fashion.

11:34.724 --> 11:38.710
Lieutenant John Knauss, who was in the Office of 
Naval Research, He was there about a year or so

11:40.630 --> 11:47.159
while I was still at the Bureau of Ships. We spent a 
great deal of time together because John was a very

11:47.960 --> 11:58.955
alert young scientist who was disdained to go on in 
oceanography.

12:02.760 --> 12:07.887
Particularly, we had been shipmates on a trip that

12:10.533 --> 12:33.570
on the Atlantis, in which I was chief scientist 
down in the Cayman Trough operating out of

12:10.533 --> 12:33.570
Guantanamo, in which we were very much interested 
in the general current structure in the area south

12:10.533 --> 12:33.570
of Guantanamo as to how it might affect

12:10.533 --> 12:33.570
Navy tests in one way or another. But this 
particular night in Washington, a short time

12:35.103 --> 12:48.036
after the Korean War

12:35.103 --> 12:48.036
broke out officially. This was perhaps within the 
first day or second day. John and I made a list of the

12:54.323 --> 13:03.372
sorts of things that oceanography needed in 
preparation for for a much larger meeting the next

13:04.769 --> 13:07.652
day. I've tried to find this piece of paper because 
it was really kind of interesting. The principal

13:13.798 --> 13:24.489
things I can remember was that it was very clear 
that Woods Hole needed a building, needed more

13:13.798 --> 13:24.489
space.

13:28.714 --> 13:33.038
It was very clear that the Columbia people needed a 
ship. And it was very clear that Scripps needed

13:35.262 --> 13:39.590
more people. This has nothing to do with the 
quality of the people at Scripps. It was just

13:45.360 --> 13:54.175
merely that they had not built up as rapidly after 
the war as some of the other organizations. And

13:55.077 --> 13:59.565
while they were very strong in some aspects of 
oceanography,

14:02.144 --> 14:07.631
certainly needed more in the physical sense.

14:09.313 --> 14:21.728
One of the advantages of having done a little bit of 
homework is that sometimes it is surprisingly how

14:09.313 --> 14:21.728
rapidly some of the suggestions get okayed and 
executed. These

14:21.748 --> 14:31.560
Woods Hole did end up with their laboratory of 
oceanography, paid for by ONR, Columbia got

14:33.903 --> 14:50.447
enough more money and enough assurance to where 
Ewing could get the VEMA and then utilize the

14:33.903 --> 14:50.447
Atlantis as a secondary ship rather than as a 
primary ship. And without any question at all, the

14:51.509 --> 15:03.707
VEMA has been one of the great ships of America and 
of the oceanographic world in general in making

14:51.509 --> 15:03.707
the business global.

15:11.483 --> 15:41.001
After

15:11.483 --> 15:41.001
leaving Washington and coming back to Woods Hole 
for full time, although I still spent quite a bit of

15:11.483 --> 15:41.001
time in Washington, the research work that I was 
primarily concerned with remained the

15:11.483 --> 15:41.001
instrumentation problems having to do with 
salinity

15:11.483 --> 15:41.001
corrected sensors.

15:45.782 --> 16:00.439
I believe I mentioned earlier that Carl 
Schleicher and Bradshaw had been hired to do this,

15:45.782 --> 16:00.439
and they carried it on with quiet distinction. The 
other was variable depth sonar, and

16:11.305 --> 16:16.610
Starting about this time, the Navy began to get a 
few experimental units. And I spent a modest

16:17.451 --> 16:41.194
amount of time with the people in the fleet trying 
to sell it, write manuals for its use, and in

16:17.451 --> 16:41.194
general, try and help the Navy move in the 
direction of aerobatic sonar. However, the

16:43.351 --> 16:56.629
convergent zone sonar and working with submarine 
people continued to be the principal thing I was

16:43.351 --> 16:56.629
interested in. And about every two years, for a 
good many years, I started making a trip to Hawaii

16:57.750 --> 17:12.430
and working with comm sub pack to help them use 
submarines, underwater sound and so forth, a

17:12.832 --> 17:26.610
little more efficiently with submarines. This 
was a continuation of the work that I had done there

17:27.030 --> 17:30.815
during the war.

17:34.380 --> 17:40.948
Submarine specific fleet was in many respects an 
easier organization to work with than

17:41.502 --> 17:44.045
submarine's Atlantic fleet. Because they were so 
much further away, they weren't bothered by as

17:44.065 --> 17:48.389
many people. So when you did get out there, you 
found you generally got more cooperation. They

17:53.294 --> 17:57.438
hadn't already been worn out by a dozen people just 
like you.

18:01.783 --> 18:08.910
One of the other aspects was that the Pacific runs 
about half a mile deeper. Certainly the Hawaiian

18:09.262 --> 18:12.328
area has deep water close at hand. So many of the 
kinds of things we wanted to do, either for testing

18:12.428 --> 18:28.637
or demonstration, were much easier to do in local 
waters there than local waters off any of the

18:12.428 --> 18:28.637
submarine bases in continental United States.

18:37.021 --> 18:39.525
Why don't you shut it down for a while? Sure.

18:43.672 --> 18:47.919
I have a series of questions to ask about this 
period we're talking about right now. I have four

18:47.939 --> 18:52.827
questions, as a matter of fact, from both the 
previous tapes and this one. First of all, now that

18:52.847 --> 19:00.480
ONR is beginning to carry more than its share of 
research, What sort of oceanographers are they

19:01.220 --> 19:10.434
bringing into ONR, and whose policy is it to bring 
in what amounts to an oceanographer to work in an

19:01.220 --> 19:10.434
ONR desk with regularity?

19:17.404 --> 19:18.646
Well, Revell moved over there. I knew Revell went 
over there. Revell went over there. Then he got

19:21.771 --> 19:28.341
Gordon Lill as his right-hand man, who had been a 
bathymograph officer during the war. And then he

19:29.772 --> 19:31.514
got Art Maxwell. And this was the nucleus of their 
oceanographic group.

19:40.002 --> 19:54.876
And back when there were so few of them, and the 
general picture was

19:40.002 --> 19:54.876
people took positive attitudes instead of 
negative attitudes. Committees hadn't grown up

19:54.936 --> 19:56.278
yet. They had a great deal of of authority and 
exercise. Is this on? Yes. So that is my, I think

20:04.315 --> 20:10.321
that is the story of ONR. Then they started getting 
people, scientists from various laboratories,

20:10.341 --> 20:17.028
to come in and spend part time. This was very good 
because it brought fresh people in for a while. It

20:23.074 --> 20:24.535
also trained people. I believe, as I said earlier, 
I can't emphasize too much the importance of

20:25.662 --> 20:49.614
having some of our brightest young people, at 
least while they're still in the impressionable

20:25.662 --> 20:49.614
age, to get them into a group where they have to 
think about a lot more than just themselves or just

20:25.662 --> 20:49.614
their laboratory and start devoting more of their 
time to the profession as a whole. I think this was

20:51.075 --> 20:53.779
one of the reasons why Why so much occurred at that 
time. All right, now that anticipates my second

20:57.035 --> 20:59.598
question. Is the bringing in of these people to 
work halftime in Onora, is this primarily a

20:59.958 --> 21:06.065
training process on Onora's part? Does Ravel look 
upon this as a? Oh, I don't think this was a

21:09.009 --> 21:11.432
training. I think it was understood this would be 
one of the results of it. But it was primarily a

21:16.557 --> 21:22.264
question of how do you get talent there? 
oftentimes you'd bring people in who had

21:22.379 --> 21:27.626
specialties in a field that was real hot then. If 
they were going to be in an ocean expedition, then

21:29.188 --> 21:43.086
you might get people to come down who were somewhat 
more specialists or involved in that particular

21:29.188 --> 21:43.086
part of the work. So this rotation had a good deal to 
do oftentimes had a good deal to do with the trend of

21:49.514 --> 21:58.545
the research, which also was the trend of the 
money. Because oceanography really almost

21:59.486 --> 22:18.390
throughout its career, as I've known it, and

21:59.486 --> 22:18.390
particularly perhaps not quite so much now 
because we tend to have so many committees now, But

22:19.417 --> 22:26.487
there would be sort of a base load for 
oceanography, of which the budget could stand

22:19.417 --> 22:26.487
about so much. And this was generally for general 
purpose oceanography and for what you might call

22:28.449 --> 22:37.181
the highly organized oceanography. Then special 
problems would come up. For example, the

22:42.128 --> 22:46.133
discovery of convergent zone sonar was one. That 
probably shoved a 30% trenchant into the

22:46.552 --> 22:53.020
budgeting of money. And it allocated not 
narrowly, but at least broadly into one general

22:54.862 --> 23:01.431
field. With discussions of things like the Indian 
Ocean Expedition, which kicked around for a

23:03.854 --> 23:15.208
couple of years to see whether people thought it 
made sense, and many people Many people did not.

23:17.915 --> 23:20.759
But it was an idea that would sell. It was an idea 
that would keep the ships afloat, which is

23:20.819 --> 23:27.349
something the modern people have little 
comprehension about. If a laboratory only has one

23:27.389 --> 23:37.062
ship, and you only see it's budgeting for it a 
couple of months in advance, you think a lot harder

23:37.868 --> 23:49.448
about what can we do to get enough financing to 
where we can keep it going for a year or two at a time.

23:52.364 --> 23:56.510
I think the budgeting of oceanography, and I don't 
mean just the budgeting. I mean the way it worked,

23:56.550 --> 24:17.397
the way it brought in people, the way it sold 
itself, the way it convinced people that it was

23:56.550 --> 24:17.397
doing things, was to keep taking on programs, some 
of which were devised by individuals, others of

23:56.550 --> 24:17.397
which, say, the Indian Ocean was one. Because it 
was clear we knew very little about the Indian

24:17.418 --> 24:20.802
Ocean. I was not heavily involved in that except a 
little bit in the early planning. I did not go on any

24:25.364 --> 24:28.928
of those Indian Ocean expeditions. But our 
science knows so much more about the Indian Ocean

24:30.069 --> 24:43.062
because of that expedition, even though many 
people thought the original planning was very

24:30.069 --> 24:43.062
poor. It at least happened.

24:47.714 --> 24:58.628
I feel very strongly as a sort of a scientific 
thesis that Mother Nature puts out interesting

24:47.714 --> 24:58.628
things in white noise. It is unlikely

25:00.470 --> 25:04.976
to... It is so unlikely that we can have an ocean 
that is not interesting.

25:12.706 --> 25:14.869
The ocean bottom, for example, is... One of the 
reasons that I became interested in deep

25:15.929 --> 25:27.947
submersibles was discussions that the bottom of 
the ocean wasn't interesting just had to be wrong.

25:30.090 --> 25:38.703
One couldn't conceive that 100 million square 
miles of ocean bottom wasn't going to have some

25:30.090 --> 25:38.703
extremely interesting places. And any technique 
that would improve our ability to see find points

25:45.899 --> 25:47.301
was important. That next question? Sure. When do 
you begin to talk in the Bureau of Ships and ONR

25:51.885 --> 25:56.831
about the necessity for NSF? Oh, this kind of thing 
was all level way over my head. I was strictly a very

26:03.798 --> 26:11.226
junior member of the game there. That kind of 
thing, people, well,

26:17.337 --> 26:26.087
Ravel,

26:17.337 --> 26:26.087
for example, was in that circle.

26:27.809 --> 26:32.114
Vannevar Bush was in that circle. Some of these 
people, there were debates as to whether it made

26:32.154 --> 26:36.078
good sense or not. But there was no question what 
some of the best scientific minds of the country

26:36.799 --> 26:43.306
were involved in. But that was at several pecking 
orders higher than I was. I was still a lucky young

26:47.780 --> 26:53.327
man who was in a good position. How did you manage to 
keep such strong contacts with the Navy in any

26:53.347 --> 26:58.012
submarine warfare between 45 and 50? Was it the 
contacts you primarily made in World War II? It was

27:02.378 --> 27:05.001
the contacts which a great many people. There were 
about half a dozen oceanographers who had been

27:05.742 --> 27:11.549
quite close to the submarine people. And our 
principal contacts, permanent ones, were

27:12.510 --> 27:17.736
through the submarine people. This rapidly grew. 
The variable depth sonar brought us much more into

27:20.822 --> 27:25.910
destroyers.

27:28.534 --> 27:46.761
Then a program which was undertaken I

27:28.534 --> 27:46.761
better be careful of the dates here, but 
undertaken in certainly the mid-50s was one that

27:28.534 --> 27:46.761
Hersey was many of us were responsible for, but 
Hersey really took it under his wing, was

27:47.332 --> 28:02.148
explosive echo ranging and working with naval 
aviators so that they could try and do echo ranging

27:47.332 --> 28:02.148
using explosives as a source, using their 
sonoboys for receivers. Here we cooperated

28:04.550 --> 28:16.663
closely with the Canadians, a great many of the 
American people, and our submarine people were

28:04.550 --> 28:16.663
also important because Woods Hole had good 
contacts with the submarine people, and so we

28:18.668 --> 28:27.638
often got the targets for the aviators to work on. 
Next

28:27.678 --> 28:31.122
question. Those were the four questions I had.

28:38.270 --> 28:44.457
I've obviously been talking with a very heavy 
strain of Navy here.

28:46.107 --> 29:02.607
This did not occupy the majority of my time, 
although the Navy was the one that paid my salary

28:46.107 --> 29:02.607
and the one that I had the greatest concern with. In 
my own case, we were spending a lot of time in

29:02.627 --> 29:09.115
instrumentation. Incidentally, when I arrived 
at Woods Hole, When Morris Ewing and I and Warzell

29:14.288 --> 29:20.718
arrived at Woods Hole, Woods Hole had almost no 
machinery. I believe one small south bend lathe

29:20.798 --> 29:23.603
and one drill press.

29:26.407 --> 29:42.372
Ewing and I had a small machine shop enough to both 
fill up and weight down a five-ton dump truck,

29:26.407 --> 29:42.372
which we brought up to Woods Hole with us for 
about... Three years, that really was the Woods

29:42.537 --> 29:49.627
Hole shop was about 90% our personal shop. We 
finally sold this machinery off, a little bit for

29:51.189 --> 30:04.347
the money, but primarily because we were 
convinced that if we left our machine shop there,

29:51.189 --> 30:04.347
the institution would never have a shop of its own. 
And this forced them to go out and buy better

30:05.129 --> 30:09.034
equipment than they would have otherwise.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.081
Why don't you shut it down?
