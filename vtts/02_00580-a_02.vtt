WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:12.914
and the overall thing have a good advanced program 
for a major where there would be some busting back

00:02.798 --> 00:12.914
and forth between the institutions. This was the 
idea, to try to strengthen these colleges by any

00:13.074 --> 00:18.923
way that we could. And I tried to set up these 
consortia in Little Rock, where there were three

00:18.944 --> 00:30.662
institutions, in Texas, where there were six 
institutions scattered over a larger area in

00:30.912 --> 00:42.743
Memphis, in northern Mississippi, in Alabama.

00:43.804 --> 00:49.510
Those are the main ones that seem to respond to the 
idea. The Ford Foundation had promised support

00:49.530 --> 00:55.496
for any that was ready to move on. I saw the greatest 
promise originally in Little Rock, where all

00:58.402 --> 01:05.734
three institutions were right together. They 
were a few miles apart.

01:10.762 --> 01:22.441
I ran into the Methodist Church,

01:10.762 --> 01:22.441
the major institution in Little Rock, Philander 
Smith, a Methodist institution. The Methodist

01:22.461 --> 01:24.645
Church was not willing surrender its autonomy in 
this situation. We had this back and forth and I

01:30.346 --> 01:48.895
could understand their feeling there because you 
see what we were trying to do in Little Rock was to

01:30.346 --> 01:48.895
sort of impose a university structure on the three 
things which of course would be controlled by the

01:30.346 --> 01:48.895
blacks. found out the extent to which the land of 
Smith was controlled by whites. That was one

01:55.023 --> 01:56.965
thing. And, in fact, they had even asked me to come 
into Little Rocks, into Little Rocks, where I

01:56.985 --> 02:13.964
knew, I knew the sources of, knew where the money 
was in Arkansas, and I was in consultation with

01:56.985 --> 02:13.964
Rockefeller. He was the governor of the state at 
that time. Of course, his foundation had gone. and

02:19.553 --> 02:23.958
developed many programs, or has since. 
Incidentally, my nephew is president of that

02:23.978 --> 02:30.305
foundation in Arkansas, Tom McCrae. But I

02:30.325 --> 02:38.233
was hopeful that that would be the one to get it 
started. And they had asked me, at least

02:38.253 --> 02:43.199
administratively, to set this thing up. Well, it 
didn't work. I can't blame the Methodist Church.

02:49.802 --> 03:05.322
No, it was just that the opposition to it came more 
from the Methodists than from Philander Smith,

02:49.802 --> 03:05.322
because that was the strongest of the 
institutions.

03:05.342 --> 03:08.807
It had most to lose, I think, by a program of 
cooperation like this. So the one that really

03:08.827 --> 03:12.612
emerged more and more with a less binding and a more 
flexible kind of organization, particularly

03:12.997 --> 03:23.267
because the institution was separated, was in 
Texas. And I, oh,

03:23.287 --> 03:41.704
as I look back on it, there are many things that I 
wish I had done, but it was not obvious at that point

03:23.287 --> 03:41.704
that Texas was going to be the one, or just how the 
structure should be set up. The thing I was trying

03:42.376 --> 03:57.851
to do in the first meeting that I organized and 
called in Texas for this purpose was to involve the

03:42.376 --> 03:57.851
major universities in the structure, too. For 
instance, the first meeting we had was at SMU in

03:57.871 --> 04:10.864
Dallas, and all of the black college presidents 
and the representative board members from each of

03:57.871 --> 04:10.864
them, and also presidents of the predominantly 
white institutions. Now, at that time, it was an

04:18.702 --> 04:29.973
interim president, I think it was Rogers, he was 
here in journalism, he was acting as interim

04:18.702 --> 04:29.973
president at North Texas. He was involved, the 
president of SMU was there, the president of the

04:29.993 --> 04:38.141
chancellor of TCU, and so forth. And what we worked 
out at that point, was a structure which had a board

04:41.725 --> 04:46.569
of trustees. It would be autonomous, but it would 
have representatives, equal, equal

04:46.589 --> 04:55.818
representatives with major universities in the 
area. Obviously, the center would have to be

04:55.838 --> 04:59.721
Dallas because of the institutions. These black 
colleges are all in the North Texas area? Well,

05:03.044 --> 05:09.910
they go down as one in Dallas, one in Waco, one in 
Austin. one in Marshall in East Texas, one in

05:10.278 --> 05:27.235
Tyler, one in Great Sandy, which is near Tyler, 
Jarvis Christian College, which is closer

05:10.278 --> 05:27.235
related to TCU there. So there were six of them. I 
could go either east on the interstate or south on

05:30.258 --> 05:36.845
the interstate from Dallas. So Dallas was the 
central place for it. So while I was gone at one

05:41.783 --> 05:53.496
point, the thing was actually organized. And some 
power structure thing was set up which placed the

05:53.516 --> 06:04.028
power in the hands of the six black college 
presidents. And that alienated some of the

06:05.493 --> 06:13.522
predominantly white university because, see, 
these were the institutions that had the

06:05.493 --> 06:13.522
resources. The North Texas group was eager and 
enthusiastic about it and were willing to,

06:14.203 --> 06:30.302
without pay, to turn loose some of their staff and 
professors to work in these various programs and

06:14.203 --> 06:30.302
so forth. And it, well, Actually, it was the board, 
but there was an executive committee of the board

06:34.973 --> 06:48.314
consisting

06:34.973 --> 06:48.314
of the black college presidents. And then a little 
later, there was a long history here of

06:48.334 --> 06:54.043
development of this thing. I was simultaneously 
trying to develop others. But this is the one that

06:57.388 --> 07:00.412
really emerged. And the presidents were ready to 
move. The Ford Foundation was right there, ready

07:03.847 --> 07:06.951
to back it. And they were going to town. And since I 
had been involved in the middle of this, and I'd

07:10.757 --> 07:21.332
been on the staff of the National Council of 
Churches for eight years, we had had New York. And

07:21.987 --> 07:29.460
it would have meant a lot to us to be able to come back 
to Texas, and particularly to Denton. So we

07:29.480 --> 07:46.729
figured, okay, we can live in Denton, and I can 
commute to Dallas, set up the office in Dallas,

07:29.480 --> 07:46.729
which we did an exchange party,

07:29.480 --> 07:46.729
which was close by and wasn't too bad commuting. So 
we did that, and another white man who had been

07:47.806 --> 08:15.940
involved in the organization, he was the business 
manager type, the business manager at Austin

07:47.806 --> 08:15.940
College, came in as vice president, I was 
president, and then we soon were able to get a

07:47.806 --> 08:15.940
fundraising man, a black, terrific young fellow, 
who is now with the United Negro College Fund. All

08:16.358 --> 08:32.359
of this publicity you see for UNCF, he's the one who 
organizes it and puts on the, what do they call

08:16.358 --> 08:32.359
them, the extravaganzas and this kind of thing. 
But UNCF, that's United Negro College Fund. We

08:35.162 --> 08:40.088
were related to them initially, but we were not 
dominated by them. We had a separate structure

08:40.108 --> 08:42.031
here. Well, this had quite a history for a while 
here. I was with this group for four years. During

08:52.752 --> 09:03.824
that four years,

08:52.752 --> 09:03.824
the four colleges that were not accredited in that 
group were accredited. We were able to bring in

09:03.844 --> 09:08.549
millions of dollars in support. We were able to get 
programs from HUW, the federal programs Well, we

09:15.455 --> 09:18.818
were just turning out proposals. This was my real 
role, to write proposals and then to try to get them

09:18.939 --> 09:39.640
accepted either by foundations or by HEW

09:18.939 --> 09:39.640
or in some cases individuals who were interested 
in this whole thing. And sometimes the greatest

09:40.008 --> 09:46.698
problem was getting them accepted on black 
colleges. But more and more, as we were able to

09:46.718 --> 09:55.491
bring in funds, we were encroaching upon the 
autonomy of black institutions. Same thing we had

09:55.511 --> 09:59.497
run into with Methodist Church in Little Auburn. 
We were running into the CME Church, Christian

09:59.517 --> 10:07.990
Methodist Episcopal Church. the AME Church, the 
AME Zion, African Methodist Episcopal, and

10:08.611 --> 10:27.160
African Methodist Episcopal Zion, so these are 
all separate Methodist denominations, as well as

10:08.611 --> 10:27.160
the American Baptist Convention, which was 
Bishop College in Texas.

10:28.203 --> 10:42.827
Autonomy is a very difficult thing to surrender, 
even a slight area of autonomy in planning for six

10:28.203 --> 10:42.827
institutions at the same time, in developing 
programs. Here was a good example of this. We had a

10:45.852 --> 10:48.696
grant from HUW. Oh, I think we had about $500,000 or 
$600,000 to develop a strong business program for

10:57.262 --> 11:03.929
the six institutions, not just secretarial 
science. They all could do that. But really to have

11:05.711 --> 11:19.886
a good business major in every one of these, 
because obviously one of the areas that needed to

11:05.711 --> 11:19.886
be worked on in the black community was to have 
business school graduates. I mean, people who

11:20.046 --> 11:26.813
could really organize and structure businesses 
in the black community or otherwise. Well, I was

11:27.738 --> 11:33.047
working with people at North Texas on this one. 
John Carroll, he is retired from the School of

11:33.187 --> 11:39.358
Business. He was acting dean for a while. He was a 
good friend. Well, I got to know him at that time

11:40.520 --> 11:47.752
through Brock, Horace Brock here. He was a good 
friend. But at any rate, John Carroll was going to

11:49.827 --> 11:54.172
organize this thing. He was given leave of absence 
in North Texas for a full year to work full time on

11:54.192 --> 12:00.760
it. He was going to be able to get some high level 
faculty people at North Texas and at SMU and TCU to

12:00.780 --> 12:15.999
work specifically on some of these programs. And 
it was, I think,

12:21.164 --> 12:30.153
a Bachelor of Business Administration, it wasn't 
really called that in all of these, but to develop

12:21.164 --> 12:30.153
that kind of program. Only one of the students had 
anything resembling that. So, this was an all-out

12:35.399 --> 12:38.062
effort. Well, we got the grant, we got the 
personnel, we were all gung-ho and ready to go.

12:45.530 --> 12:48.673
Then we had a meeting, I guess this was No, it was in 
Austin. And John Carroll was there, he presented

12:52.348 --> 12:58.539
his plans, and so forth. And my presidents, 
through the funding, said we will use these funds

12:58.759 --> 13:11.961
to apportion them to each individual 
institution. except for a

13:12.515 --> 13:18.063
total of four appearances. And we will not have 
this break. And I had to go back and tell John

13:21.448 --> 13:25.735
Carroll that he was fired before he could get to 
work. Boy, that hurt. I could understand their

13:28.719 --> 13:30.241
position. Each one of these presidents was 
fighting the budget battle. They all had

13:33.927 --> 13:36.350
deficits. They had to scrounge for every dollar 
they could get. So the idea was we could maintain

13:41.000 --> 14:09.403
the appearance of this program by apparently 
channeling these grants to the business

13:41.000 --> 14:09.403
administration or the business departments of 
each one of these schools, and then having a small

13:41.000 --> 14:09.403
program, retaining Dr. Carroll, if he would work 
on this basis,

14:10.548 --> 14:33.240
have some training sessions and so forth, and use 
some of these high-level faculty people at the

14:10.548 --> 14:33.240
universities and so forth, really more for the 
benefit of the faculty than for the students, and

14:10.548 --> 14:33.240
to try to enroll some of the faculty in some of the 
graduate programs in North Texas. Well, this was

14:33.260 --> 14:39.829
disheartening because it was a real solid program 
that was worked out. I guess that was the beginning

14:40.079 --> 14:48.815
of the end, as far as I was concerned, because they 
were so preoccupied. And this was by necessity. I

14:51.200 --> 14:53.003
understood this. So preoccupied

14:53.023 --> 15:00.296
with making the budgets and the deficits. It was 
impossible, really, to get beyond that. Well, at

15:04.075 --> 15:24.585
the same time, we, with the young black man, Melvin 
Shaw, who was vice president for development and

15:04.075 --> 15:24.585
stuff, we had raised, in matching grants, Ford 
Foundation would match funds we could raise in

15:04.075 --> 15:24.585
Texas. A very ambitious structure. We had visions 
and had commitments of six million dollars to form

15:29.708 --> 15:47.848
a university structure for these six 
institutions.

15:49.570 --> 15:50.952
It was pretty far out. It was trying to move too far, 
too fast.

15:56.185 --> 16:13.389
visited several schools, particularly in 
California, to try to learn as much about this kind

15:56.185 --> 16:13.389
of overall structure at the University of the 
Pacific, which is more or less on the Oxford

15:56.185 --> 16:13.389
England basis of having small autonomous 
colleges. But still, there's a university

16:13.409 --> 16:18.396
structure that is overall While there's autonomy 
in undergraduate education and so forth, the

16:18.933 --> 16:28.383
university structure would deal with the 
cooperative things between them. Also, the

16:28.403 --> 16:31.326
University of California Center. Is that the one 
that you helped? Yes. I'd been a consultant in

16:33.448 --> 16:40.736
establishing the religious program there, which 
. But at any rate, this was based on small,

16:40.756 --> 16:45.801
autonomous colleges as well. And so I visited both 
of those to see if we could find some structural

16:46.355 --> 17:02.726
means by which we could overcome this concern with 
loss of autonomy in these institutions. And we

17:02.746 --> 17:04.650
simply were not able to do it. I guess I went too far 
in trying to go too fast. I lost the confidence of

17:11.175 --> 17:18.849
the black presidents, and I miss those nuances 
that I should have been listening for. I don't

17:18.989 --> 17:29.929
know, maybe a white man can never get those, but it 
all ended very unhappily in that Here we were ready

17:30.803 --> 17:42.857
in the structure of our little organization with 
three executive staff people, about a half dozen

17:30.803 --> 17:42.857
secretaries and so forth. We were just an office 
and of course all the everything that we did was

17:42.977 --> 17:52.268
related to the college. But we insisted that we 
could raise the funds but only on the basis of

18:00.048 --> 18:10.384
maintaining the control of the funds and the 
universal structure, and working from that

18:00.048 --> 18:10.384
basis. Because the foundations and HEW also were 
simply not willing. There had already been a

18:16.935 --> 18:20.000
number of incidents. Of course, the structure and 
the planning of a traditional black college is

18:20.521 --> 18:26.410
very different, auditive accounts and so forth 
that we are accustomed to predominantly quite. It

18:33.404 --> 18:45.397
wasn't a question of dishonesty as much as it was a 
question of power within the structure of the

18:33.404 --> 18:45.397
black church, within the structure of the black 
colleges. So while we were working with the

18:45.417 --> 18:54.186
business administration, with the business 
departments of the colleges, trying to get

18:45.417 --> 18:54.186
competent, business managers in the college, 
vice presidents for business or administration

18:54.773 --> 19:05.673
or something like that. We had accomplished a good 
bit, and on the basis of some of the changes made,

19:06.454 --> 19:16.433
you see, there had been grants both to the 
individual colleges and other ones. Well, during

19:16.453 --> 19:18.216
all of this time, Bishop College was, of course, 
this was the major institution of these six. It was

19:24.636 --> 19:34.491
the strongest, best financed, the best campus, 
newest

19:24.636 --> 19:34.491
buildings. And it was the one that was pursuing its 
own program with the Ford Foundation

19:34.511 --> 19:48.051
to strengthen it. Well, at the same time, we had 
this program worked out with the Ford Foundation

19:48.520 --> 20:01.473
commitment to go ahead with it if we could match 
bucks within the state of Texas. We were working

20:01.493 --> 20:17.228
with the Brown Foundation, the Moody Foundation, 
the Sid Richardson Foundation, and this young

20:01.493 --> 20:17.228
fellow we had, Melvin Shaw, was really doing the 
job. because he was bearding these people

20:17.714 --> 20:20.578
constantly. And I would turn out, churn out the 
proposals. Some of them, I think, were more for

20:25.585 --> 20:30.512
appearances than anything else. But we were in a 
hurry. I mean, we had to do something. We knew the

20:37.041 --> 20:39.705
time was limited. I'd been here nearly four years, 
and as I pointed out, something people didn't

20:39.725 --> 20:45.072
think was funny. about how much tenure does a white 
president of a consortium of black colleges have.

20:51.923 --> 21:01.337
I figured I would have 40 years before leadership

20:51.923 --> 21:01.337
could be turned over to a bunch of blacks. I guess I 
was a necessary entree into the white community

21:01.357 --> 21:08.207
initially, but of course blacks by this time had 
full entree into In fact, they were the favorite

21:08.963 --> 21:28.888
spokesmen for one of the colleges, two 
foundations, and even the staff at HEW about this

21:08.963 --> 21:28.888
time that dealt with these things was black. A very 
lovely lady who had been president of Bennett

21:28.908 --> 21:33.013
College was the head of the section at HEW that 
dealt with that college. sure shipped a lot of

21:35.221 --> 21:39.406
proposals her way. But the point came where they 
simply were not willing to surrender this

21:40.608 --> 21:48.378
autonomy. And there was a very specific rivalry 
here as far as Bishop College was concerned. They

21:56.188 --> 22:00.553
were pursuing the same funds as Bishop College. We 
had a severance of ways here. In a sense, I was

22:05.506 --> 22:06.247
fired. In a sense, I was unwilling to continue on 
the basis of what seemed to me to be

22:07.448 --> 22:20.382
misappropriation of funds. You see, it was my 
name, and my integrity, and the integrity of the

22:20.402 --> 22:25.748
structure. that would raise these funds, and then 
once they got them, they could be used for other

22:26.386 --> 22:35.357
purposes. And legally, this was, I mean, I was 
getting into difficulty here, too, because I

22:35.377 --> 22:45.189
couldn't control the funds. And this was a great 
tragedy. It was a personal tragedy for me, even as

22:47.772 --> 22:56.342
much as the Hampton Sydney experience, because 
here was the other side of it. And it turned out to be

22:57.807 --> 23:14.091
a tragic experience for the colleges as well, 
because three of

22:57.807 --> 23:14.091
these presidents were subsequently indicted. I 
didn't, I stayed out of it from that point, once I

23:14.111 --> 23:22.483
was out of it. I don't know, I guess there were some 
ways that I could have I could have called it on

23:27.743 --> 23:54.388
this, but after all, I've been working for five 
years with the National Council in Texas to try to

23:27.743 --> 23:54.388
do something

23:27.743 --> 23:54.388
for these colleagues,

23:27.743 --> 23:54.388
to put them in the mainstream, help them come to the 
mainstream. I think we accomplished some things,

23:54.408 --> 23:55.489
but we failed. most critical

23:56.043 --> 24:00.128
and important to us. Since that time, of course, 
Mission College has fallen into new lanes, and

24:00.188 --> 24:08.998
this was the strongest. Probably the strongest 
remaining one was Houston Tillotson in Austin,

24:09.018 --> 24:21.633
because of the strong president they had through 
the years, John McKeith. Jarvis Christian

24:21.653 --> 24:23.215
College which

24:23.684 --> 24:41.605
is related to TCU, which is sort of a subsidiary of a 
white college. Never has been in all kinds of black

24:41.625 --> 24:44.909
institutions. They've trained a lot of black 
leaders, I think. They've had two presidents. And

24:46.471 --> 24:47.532
then Wiley College in Marshall. president who was 
there when I was there when I was well he was he was

24:49.891 --> 25:12.557
the chairman of the board actually he left under 
some cloud and then the man who came in was indicted

24:49.891 --> 25:12.557
who really had nothing to do with it but he was 
carrying around policies It's just a different

25:13.398 --> 25:22.837
world, and this is one thing I think both the courts 
and otherwise have to recognize about these

25:13.398 --> 25:22.837
institutions. They have operated as arms of the 
black church, and the black church functions in a

25:22.857 --> 25:32.436
sort of a power way. But I don't think any or many, 
certainly not many, of these people have ever

25:33.007 --> 25:41.757
feathered their own nests. I think they've been 
honest and responsible in these terms. But how

25:46.143 --> 25:58.137
they use funds and whether it is subject to an audit 
by Pete Martin and Mitchell or these big

25:46.143 --> 25:58.137
accounting firms, We were trying to get their 
books in order so that they could be straightened

25:58.454 --> 26:18.418
out in this way, and what was basically an honest 
operation be put on the books so that it could be

25:58.454 --> 26:18.418
demonstrated to be by the white man's standards. 
White man's way of doing things was by audits.

26:21.782 --> 26:24.225
Black man's way of doing things was by 
personalities,

26:25.167 --> 26:37.565
relationships,

26:25.167 --> 26:37.565
power structures within the church. So they've 
had to conform, you see,

26:37.585 --> 26:46.057
to get money from any point of service and really to 
exist legally. And it's been a difficult time. I

26:47.299 --> 26:50.163
think the black colleges since that time, they had 
a renaissance. They were able to Not just the ones

26:51.762 --> 26:59.814
that we worked with particularly, but

26:51.762 --> 26:59.814
because of the federal programs and others. For a 
while, they were able to move right along. But

27:04.821 --> 27:15.377
inevitably,

27:04.821 --> 27:15.377
integration was taking place in higher 
education. And again, these schools I have become

27:18.543 --> 27:22.629
more remedial institutions. There's still a real 
role for them, I'm sure. And they graduate,

27:27.576 --> 27:35.808
and there are many people still. And

27:36.710 --> 27:41.577
basically, they're still accredited by the 
Southern Association. But there are problems.

27:43.889 --> 27:52.861
And there are

27:43.889 --> 27:52.861
problems that can be alleviated fondly over a very 
close relationship with other higher education

27:43.889 --> 27:52.861
institutions. So they're still acting at the 
community college level, really? Yeah, they're

27:56.786 --> 28:00.191
four-year institutions. But of course, when you 
consider

28:00.211 --> 28:12.107
the fact that a great many of the students are 
there, the whole first two years have to be

28:00.211 --> 28:12.107
remedial programs. while

28:12.560 --> 28:32.997
the more select

28:12.560 --> 28:32.997
of those came from close to Falkland, Texas and 
other integrated institutions. Of course, the

28:33.017 --> 28:42.145
public schools are largely integrated now, but 
when you get a school system like Dallas's, where

28:33.017 --> 28:42.145
some of the schools are primarily black student 
bodies, then you have, well, There's still

28:43.019 --> 28:48.598
remedial training that needs to be done to do what 
kind of college it's at. Of course, this happens in

28:49.200 --> 28:52.471
white schools, too. I mean, for instance, gym. He 
did pretty well in high school, played in the Honor

28:55.220 --> 29:03.728
Society and so forth, but he had to learn to read 
when he got to Davidson. I mean, he had to take the

29:03.748 --> 29:11.116
speed reading course, which was kind of a remedial

29:03.748 --> 29:11.116
reading. But Jim had never read for fun. This was a 
thing. Most of us who came along in the last

29:14.899 --> 29:22.847
generation, for entertainment

29:14.899 --> 29:22.847
we would read. it's not so so much true for this this

29:23.401 --> 29:51.417
generation of students and uh read rapidly well 
this is the kind of thing that has to be done in our

29:23.401 --> 29:51.417
educational system throughout and it's just 
magnified several

29:23.401 --> 29:51.417
times those colleges as a whole just i've never 
been able to get that broad sense of purpose that

29:52.375 --> 30:05.309
you all were trying to bring in just because they 
were getting so caught up in the, as you say, the

29:52.375 --> 30:05.309
deficits and trying to deal with the different 
cultures. Right. Well, this is the thing that we

30:07.571 --> 30:13.317
had to fight and deal with and where we lost the 
fight. I guess that's why I focus upon that because

30:13.438 --> 30:20.325
this was the point of our defeat. Their 
preoccupation with surviving. This is not only

30:26.790 --> 30:39.768
with the presidents and the administrators of the 
college, but with the churches that they are

30:26.790 --> 30:39.768
responsible to or related to. This is their 
institution still. And this is, well, there's

30:44.154 --> 30:51.745
just no way they can divorce themselves from it in 
terms of control. in

30:52.349 --> 31:06.110
terms of autonomy, even if it's impossible to have 
adequate educational

30:52.349 --> 31:06.110
programs on that basis. Because you see, the point 
was reached, and this was the real point where the

31:06.130 --> 31:21.293
government programs and the foundation programs

31:06.130 --> 31:21.293
were no longer, as it's often been expressed 
pouring

31:21.948 --> 31:45.351
money down the rabbit

31:21.948 --> 31:45.351
hole.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.333
If they couldn't see the specific results of the 
money that they gave, that was all they could do.

31:47.353 --> 31:51.077
And if they could see it in terms of programs, and 
graduates, and fields, which were important for

31:47.353 --> 31:51.077
the improvement of the black situation, 
educationally in other words, And the

31:52.373 --> 32:11.218
foundations

31:52.373 --> 32:11.218
were

31:52.373 --> 32:11.218
turning off.

32:11.238 --> 32:12.900
And of course, the whole federal program now was 
the Reagan administration. They reversed the

32:12.920 --> 32:15.664
Civil Rights Revolution in four years. But any 
rate, it was the defeat of everything that was

32:16.167 --> 32:23.977
important to me, at least. Important to a lot of 
people. That's another story,

32:26.841 --> 32:30.966
I guess. But the black, it's hard to kill an 
institution. It's just that they're

32:35.953 --> 32:41.119
not progressive. They've become largely 
remedial institutions with more and more

32:48.162 --> 33:00.248
don't

32:48.162 --> 33:00.248
seem

32:48.162 --> 33:00.248
to be able to be solid. They've turned inward, 
rather than outward. Of course, what we would hope

33:03.354 --> 33:06.120
to realize, they can turn outward in terms of 
support, in terms of a radical education. North

33:07.163 --> 33:15.754
Texas was the only state institution that was 
involved in that, concerning with the University

33:07.163 --> 33:15.754
of Texas or any other school? Yes. Now, others were 
involved primarily with the institutions, the

33:16.635 --> 33:23.183
local institutions. For instance, University of 
Texas never did. I never did get much response from

33:26.427 --> 33:32.395
them, but they have had programs with Houston 
Public Schools. And Baylor with Paul Quinn, this

33:33.353 --> 33:43.848
is, never has been, much has never been involved. 
But Paul Quinn is a Baptist school? No, it's a

33:46.012 --> 33:49.377
Methodist school. Oh, it's a Methodist school. 
Now Baylor was more sympathetic toward, toward

33:54.624 --> 34:01.875
the College of Dallas, Bishop, because it's 
Baptist. Nothing really practical,

34:02.176 --> 34:10.945
incidental, locally, in some cases. But North 
Texas was the primary one, I think.

34:16.952 --> 34:29.144
It's because some of us were involved here,

34:16.952 --> 34:29.144
the people that I knew here, who were interested 
and were able to get into Woodlands. North Texas

34:29.164 --> 34:29.945
was in on the ground floor. Austin College was real 
interesting because they were not a university.

34:32.804 --> 34:44.437
But their president

34:32.804 --> 34:44.437
was very much involved in things. He was very 
disciplined with the things. But the way they did

34:48.582 --> 34:56.932
in East Texas, in Commerce, was they were setting 
up programs both with Wiley College and with Texas

34:48.582 --> 34:56.932
College. Was that leadership base working in the 
school strong? Were they from the South, or were

35:00.075 --> 35:01.697
they from the North, like as you're educated in 
Princeton, plus your background. That's what I

35:07.235 --> 35:08.297
meant with the other. You're speaking of the 
whites or the blacks? The people that were

35:10.580 --> 35:13.704
involved at North Texas, the people that were 
involved. I think both, both. For instance, the

35:17.689 --> 35:31.127
people that I was able to enlist in North Texas had 
primarily a Texas background, Southern

35:17.689 --> 35:31.127
background, East Texas, North Texas. But, of 
course, they were educating institutions all

35:32.002 --> 35:37.811
over the country. No, there's never been any 
regional

35:37.831 --> 35:43.699
bias here. Of course, in the South, back in the old 
days, the more progressive elements were trying

35:43.739 --> 35:59.983
to do things about black education for a long time, 
and some of the strong leadership in this movement

36:00.284 --> 36:04.569
has come from whites in the South. And a lot of the 
people who moved to these black campuses, for

36:04.589 --> 36:26.595
instance, in Miles College in Birmingham, an 
outstanding place, I forget his name, moved down

36:04.589 --> 36:26.595
from Yale, and set up a program

36:29.056 --> 36:41.413
in, well, this was one of the media programs, and so 
forth. And there was a lot of publicity about this,

36:41.794 --> 36:46.681
but it was a genuine thing that he did. He moved down 
there and stayed

36:46.701 --> 36:51.608
until his retirement. And there have been a lot of 
instances of this kind of thing, not as well as

36:51.628 --> 36:56.194
public instances of it.

36:59.920 --> 37:16.040
people from the major institutions have felt 
enough call and enough

36:59.920 --> 37:16.040
responsibility to get involved and to move onto 
these campuses to do the job that he's doing. Did

37:16.060 --> 37:21.766
you have any interaction with Reverend Price from 
Lexington, Virginia? I had read an article about

37:21.867 --> 37:24.850
that. He was in the Presbyterian Church, and I had 
read something about him talking at the General

37:27.764 --> 37:39.539
Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church, 
and he went out on a limb with that, and I think it was

37:27.764 --> 37:39.539
like May 28. Nice. Yeah, you're talking about a 
missionary from China. Yeah, he was a moderator,

37:44.545 --> 37:49.230
had been moderator of the General Assembly. 
Right, right. He was, yes, he was very much

37:50.452 --> 37:55.358
involved in the early Did

37:56.671 --> 38:04.619
he work with your wife's family there when you were 
in China? Yes, yes they had in China. They knew he

38:06.181 --> 38:24.079
was primarily in Shanghai and administrative 
roles in China and then he was there even after the

38:06.181 --> 38:24.079
communists came in. didn't know which price you 
were talking about. Yes, he was very much in the

38:27.057 --> 38:36.435
picture then and was certainly a leader in any kind 
of progressive or liberal ideas. He was one of the

38:36.456 --> 38:42.287
leaders in the church as far as integration and of 
the two branches of the church, and I guess it was

38:42.588 --> 38:53.921
probably that 54th General Assembly, wasn't it, 
where he was so much ahead of us? Well, this is the

38:53.941 --> 39:07.296
one that I attended, and what came out of that 
meeting was a very strong Yeah.

39:16.113 --> 39:24.944
Were those missionaries, the missionaries that 
came back a strong force in trying to... I think by

39:24.965 --> 39:27.948
and large they were. Some of them were very 
conservative theologically, and unfortunately

39:27.968 --> 39:33.756
this came as a sort of a conservative-liberal 
issue. Of course, conservative in the South means

39:38.469 --> 39:43.979
conservative in social questions. There are two 
different questions entirely. Theological

39:48.387 --> 39:55.018
conservatism and liberalism, and social 
liberalism and conservatism. Of course, more

39:55.038 --> 39:58.765
recently, those things have become so polarized 
liberal as a liberal and a conservative as a

39:59.116 --> 40:10.409
conservative in the church or anywhere else 
without regard to some of the nuances in the

39:59.116 --> 40:10.409
situation. But the missionaries, by and large, 
did support integration. They did support the

40:16.517 --> 40:20.722
reunion of the two churches. Of course, they had 
worked in China or everywhere else with

40:20.742 --> 40:26.068
Presbyterians of the other stripe.

40:28.310 --> 40:38.842
Did

40:28.310 --> 40:38.842
you work at all with Russ College of Mississippi, 
Holly Springs, Mississippi? Yeah. That was where

40:39.082 --> 40:48.853
my father went down from here in Cato State to do an 
exchange program with their campus ministers.

40:48.873 --> 40:49.213
Yeah. And he's mentioned Northern Mississippi. 
What was the date of that? I was, my mother was

40:54.196 --> 40:57.261
pregnant at that time. I think it was the spring of 
1963. 63. Well, I had probably visited there,

41:02.869 --> 41:21.979
let's see, it was about a year or so before, and we 
were talking about, let's see, there are two

41:02.869 --> 41:21.979
colleges in Holly Springs, and then there are 
three in Memphis, which is not too far away. Right.

41:22.782 --> 41:27.951
And then there were two near Jackson. That 
scattering,

41:27.971 --> 41:41.433
we didn't pursue too far. That kind of separation. 
But we talked to the people there. Of course, they

41:44.818 --> 41:45.820
were eager to get in on something. But, yes, I 
remember how

41:47.639 --> 41:56.773
they spread this very well. I just spent, I think, a 
couple of days there. We talked about a lot of

42:01.901 --> 42:04.345
things. But that must have been about a year or more 
ago. I've been browsing through some picture

42:06.669 --> 42:09.373
books. Now, you were living there. Well, my... My 
dad was the campus minister of the Wesley

42:14.318 --> 42:19.469
Foundation up in Mankato. And they came down to 
spend some time with my students. Well, were you

42:25.943 --> 42:27.005
bored then? No, I was just getting ready to work. A 
few months ago. Right, 63, 63. Yeah, that's Jim's

42:33.464 --> 42:36.589
birthday. A year or two. Yeah. Yeah, your wife 
would say she was thinking Jim was 23 the other day.

42:43.719 --> 42:44.380
She lost it. Yeah. Easy to lose a year. She probably 
could grow up real fast.

42:53.113 --> 42:55.817
Yeah, well, you know, it's hard to... sort of gauge 
time like that, from this perspective, because

42:56.152 --> 43:03.062
it's been a while.

43:06.687 --> 43:12.375
Well, I appreciate it very much.

43:13.336 --> 43:13.697
It's time to talk. It's a privilege for me to rehash 
some of his old history. It's been a lot of byways

43:20.466 --> 43:25.433
and I suppose there's no, you do something like 
this with a strong moral feeling, but there are

43:27.218 --> 43:38.648
always compromises. There's nothing black and 
white about it in terms of morality. A lot of the

43:46.835 --> 43:53.020
things I think I would have done differently. I 
don't know, maybe it had to be confrontation. the

43:56.513 --> 44:01.780
confrontation of people like Martin Luther King. 
Of course, he was always insistent that it was

44:01.800 --> 44:13.295
non-violence and so forth, and it was to a certain 
extent, but it was confrontation. It

44:13.496 --> 44:18.022
was antagonism. And some of the things I 
deliberately, well, let me go on and mention a

44:18.042 --> 44:23.289
couple of other things. Some of the things I 
deliberately didn't participating because I

44:25.454 --> 44:34.084
wasn't really with him. One of them was the Selma 
March in which Martin Luther King was present. Of

44:41.932 --> 44:54.246
course, they were deliberately trying to bring on 
violence for the reaction that it would get for the

44:41.932 --> 44:54.246
cause of equality and freedom and what have you, 
knowing that the rednecks in Alabama would oppose

44:54.800 --> 45:07.355
it with violence and so forth. But one perspective 
that I got on this, I have some cousins in Selma,

45:07.375 --> 45:15.885
Alabama. They are part of the medical community 
there. And they were considered the medical group

45:22.627 --> 45:27.373
there, the group of doctors and hospital, were 
very concerned. They thought there was going to be

45:27.393 --> 45:43.013
even more violence than there was because all of 
the rednecks in the surrounding

45:27.393 --> 45:43.013
country had been harming themselves and making 
all kinds of outlandish statements. And when it

45:43.033 --> 45:48.820
looked as if it was inevitable, this march to 
Montgomery from Selma, uh what the local and this

45:50.167 --> 46:13.795
this is on the records of the medical association 
they went to the organizers

45:50.167 --> 46:13.795
of this and said look there's going to be violence 
we are here to serve those who need help we're not

45:50.167 --> 46:13.795
going to take any position on what you're doing

46:15.023 --> 46:29.500
As far as that concerns, our only

46:15.023 --> 46:29.500
purpose is to provide medical help, because we 
think it's important. And be free to come to us, to

46:29.520 --> 46:41.774
the hospital, anything that happens, because we 
are determined to minimize this as much as

46:29.520 --> 46:41.774
possible and help in every way that we can. Well, 
they were turned down because of a fight. Because

46:45.348 --> 46:50.962
they were fearful, I think, that there would be 
some kind of betrayal. They really trusted them.

46:52.707 --> 46:56.035
Well, there were two people killed there. One was 
Reed,

46:56.055 --> 47:00.106
James Reed, I think. He was a graduate of Princeton 
Seminary.
