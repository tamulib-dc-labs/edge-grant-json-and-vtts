00:02.292 --> 00:09.325
Let's

00:02.292 --> 00:09.325
see.

00:12.971 --> 00:16.678
The extracurricular student organizations, 
what were the big? Well, again, I was limited in

00:18.702 --> 00:22.369
participation. There were hometown clubs, they 
were very important. And which one did you

00:25.546 --> 00:27.488
associate with? I guess I went with San Antonio, 
and they met, but I, you know, I didn't, it wasn't

00:27.508 --> 00:39.503
any big deal, and then they had the Silent Solemn 
Club in the department, and again, I did

00:27.508 --> 00:39.503
participate some in them. One of my, either my 
frustrations, or I don't know how it is, is that I

00:40.284 --> 00:54.861
had, I guess, wanted to participate in some of the 
judging programs, livestock judging teams,

00:40.284 --> 00:54.861
because that was a high-level recognition to 
participate. But I found it very incompatible

00:58.691 --> 01:07.643
with both the academic and work schedule because 
they just, it was kind of like band and football, it

00:58.691 --> 01:07.643
just took an inordinate amount of time. I mean you 
were expected to practice three, two or three or

01:07.723 --> 01:15.874
four hours a day and then make a lot of weekend trips 
and everything. And it was extremely time

01:16.835 --> 01:23.464
consuming and I took the courses out of which the 
teams were picked But to make a commitment to go on

01:24.305 --> 01:31.732
the team, you tried out for it, it was so time 
consuming. I think I qualified for one or two and

01:31.772 --> 01:37.136
then just decided it was just too much to handle. I 
mean it was, if you're familiar with the livestock

01:37.837 --> 01:49.768
judging thing, it has, I think other than helping 
with your judgment, it's kind of like a debating

01:37.837 --> 01:49.768
thing. You learn how to express yourself. and have 
to be, you know... Who was, who was the academic

01:52.840 --> 01:57.525
advisor? Do you remember? Well, at the time it was 
Bill Warren, and he was a toughy. You know, we're

02:02.990 --> 02:05.373
good friends now, and I remind him of this. He had, 
he was fresh out of the Marines from World War II

02:06.233 --> 02:17.084
when he came here, and I guess may not have even had 
his doctorate by then, because at that time a lot of

02:06.233 --> 02:17.084
the professors didn't have their doctorate. They 
had master's, maybe master's degree. Anyway, he

02:19.747 --> 02:20.788
was solid marine discipline, I mean, in his 
judging teams. I don't know if that turned me off,

02:24.750 --> 02:37.921
but to this day he denies that he did that, but to 
shake you up when he wanted to be sure that the

02:24.750 --> 02:37.921
reasons that you gave, why you placed this animal 
over that, that you had solid reasons. And if he

02:37.941 --> 02:41.925
didn't agree with you, he'd look you 
cold-bloodedly in the eye and say, you lied to me.

02:44.947 --> 02:48.090
You know, you weren't consistent in what you said 
one time with him. He said, he just looked you right

02:48.110 --> 02:51.653
in the eye and said, you lied to me. But as I said, I 
consider him one of my good friends, and we'd laugh

02:52.139 --> 02:58.087
over that to this day. He says he wouldn't have ever 
said that, but I know he did. Now, what facilities

03:02.292 --> 03:06.077
were there for animal science across the tracks? 
Nothing then. It was all in the pavilion. The

03:08.821 --> 03:10.863
judging was always, they brought the animals in. 
And that was the coldest and the hottest place in

03:10.883 --> 03:14.248
the world. At the old time, they used to, I remember 
freezing in there, they'd bring a, Well, the usual

03:18.852 --> 03:27.300
way of judging for the teams was you'd get a class of 
four animals, four sheep, four horses, four kind

03:18.852 --> 03:27.300
of steers or whatever. They'd bring them in, and 
you'd judge them there. And the animal science

03:31.604 --> 03:34.547
building was all-inclusive. It even had the meat 
laboratory in it. It had everything in there,

03:36.349 --> 03:37.770
pretty much. And then they had their farms across 
the track. And you occasionally visited those as

03:41.254 --> 03:43.576
students. They had a sheep farm, swine farm, beef 
camp, and so forth. During all of your

03:48.383 --> 03:55.313
undergraduate years did you get to make any exotic 
trip as a part of the judging? You didn't get to go to

03:55.694 --> 03:57.096
Kansas City? No, I said I opted not to go with the 
Thames because it just took too much time. And you

04:01.883 --> 04:15.943
know I've had nephews and others that have done 
this and even now our grandnieces and nephews are

04:01.883 --> 04:15.943
participating in that, but it was just too time 
consuming I thought. And Dr. Butler, did you have

04:16.531 --> 04:19.114
any courses with him? Yes, I did, and I can tell you a 
story on him that he denied to his... He was a very

04:22.758 --> 04:29.507
emphatic teacher, and he had come out of the 
military, too, with some rank, I guess. He was a

04:30.788 --> 04:33.271
Mitzvah person, taught Mitz. And this is a true 
story, but he denies it to this day, as I told you,

04:34.172 --> 04:41.381
but he's passed away here recently.

04:44.104 --> 04:45.846
But we had this... situations, I told you, if you 
were in the upper 25% and made an A or B, you could

04:46.096 --> 04:54.184
exempt your final. Well, that particular year, I 
don't know which it was, might have been my junior,

04:54.205 --> 05:01.172
I took the basic meets course, and I was tottering. 
I was pushed for grades, and I was tottering

05:01.272 --> 05:15.647
between an A and a B, and I think the final counted a 
third, and I got to thinking, you know, I was

05:01.272 --> 05:15.647
computing my averages, that if I could almost max 
the final, I could raise my grade. But, you know,

05:21.232 --> 05:30.201
since my idea was to look at the final and decide, 
you know, if this isn't what I want to do, or I can't

05:21.232 --> 05:30.201
do it, I might as well not. I guess one of the 
problems was, since it was sort of an optional

05:30.582 --> 05:36.908
thing, I really didn't study as hard as I should 
have. Well, the final was a beast. I mean, I looked

05:39.811 --> 05:44.436
at it and scanned through it, and I said, boy, I'm 
glad I'm exempt. I started to leave. And he said, I

05:46.036 --> 05:47.478
couldn't. I made the option. And I pulled my grade 
down to a C. And I never had forgiven him. I must have

05:54.568 --> 05:56.010
really blown that thing. He denies that. But 
another thing, he was very emphatic. He was one

06:01.397 --> 06:05.663
day, somebody asked him, you're familiar with the 
term jowl? And he said, I don't know which way he

06:07.987 --> 06:10.630
said it. He said, jowl. And somebody said, is that 
the way you pronounce it? And he said, of course. I

06:17.461 --> 06:18.583
was trying to think of the word. How? He said, you 
know, rhymes with that. Voice from the

06:23.169 --> 06:25.892
background, what about bowl? He couldn't respond 
to that one. He was put down for one time. Did the

06:32.081 --> 06:33.943
student have a nickname for him? No. I remember 
another professor I shouldn't identify with.

06:40.091 --> 06:41.473
Well, I guess it... What was his name? He taught 
sheep courses. Dahlberg, Dahlberg. He was kind of

06:49.863 --> 06:54.907
a laid-back type of professor, and I think some 
called him sleepy. Anyway, one day I remember him

06:55.968 --> 07:02.594
coming into our class and just throwing his 
materials on the desk and obviously very unhappy.

07:03.515 --> 07:11.022
He said he just came from Casey's, where people got 
coffee, and he said he overheard two students

07:12.183 --> 07:14.725
standing in line there and one of them said, can I 
buy you a cup of coffee? I said, no thanks. They

07:15.926 --> 07:18.269
said, I'm going to Dahlberg's class and it may keep 
me awake.

07:21.772 --> 07:27.777
Oh, that's a good one.

07:27.817 --> 07:30.840
You're here four years as an undergraduate. As you 
look back, to which faculty members would you give

07:31.581 --> 07:38.387
the highest marks that you, whose courses you had? 
Well, Dr. Miller taught I think a sheep course that

07:41.883 --> 07:44.606
I thought very highly of. Tom Harrington I've 
mentioned. And

07:48.411 --> 07:56.161
Bill Warren was a great teacher, don't get me wrong 
on that. Bryson, Dr. Adrians, Dr. Bryson, these

07:56.181 --> 08:01.889
were people that stand out. Fred Bryson? Yeah. 
People that I had courses under that stand out.

08:06.575 --> 08:10.860
Which one was the toughest in terms of making the 
grade that you wanted? the most demanding? I don't

08:15.311 --> 08:16.452
really know. That may be hard to point that out. I 
might indicate

08:20.677 --> 08:28.806
what happened subsequently. I mean, we're taking 
a lot of time on this particular part, but I'll just

08:28.826 --> 08:34.212
quickly thumbnail the rest of my career. After the 
sophomore year, I did stay here for one summer, one

08:35.274 --> 08:41.961
semester. I had the idea that since I was always 
carrying twenty to twenty-four hours I could

08:42.970 --> 08:52.139
graduate early and with the one to six hours in the 
summer maybe I could graduate early. I was eager to

08:52.700 --> 09:08.556
get into the workforce and I worked here one, 
between my sophomore and junior year I went the

08:52.700 --> 09:08.556
first semester summer term and took some courses, 
a couple courses, which was a mistake. You can't

09:09.517 --> 09:12.100
imagine how hot those dormitories are. even with 
fans, they soak up the brick, and so forth, soaks up

09:12.755 --> 09:42.441
the heat, and it was really, and classes were hot 
too, even though they started at seven in the

09:12.755 --> 09:42.441
morning, but then I spent the rest of the summer 
working on the farm again, but I did, I was

09:12.755 --> 09:42.441
accumulating hours pretty fast, to the extent 
that I got my, qualified for my senior ring, I guess

09:12.755 --> 09:42.441
about a year or at least a semester ahead of my 
colleagues, and so that was a big achievement for

09:12.755 --> 09:42.441
me, and... How did you feel when you got that ring?

09:45.222 --> 09:46.103
It's indescribable. Anything after that would be 
anticlimactical. Do you remember what it cost?

09:53.770 --> 09:55.812
Thirty bucks, something like that, I think. And 
did you earn it, or did your parents give it? Well, I

09:59.995 --> 10:00.396
paid for it. I mean, I'm pretty well paid for 
everything. Have you ever lost it? No, never. And

10:06.121 --> 10:12.647
what about some interesting stories where 
somebody, some far, faraway place spotted it? Oh,

10:13.201 --> 10:14.342
I've read about those. But you've not had... No, 
I've never lost it. I've never lost it. And I don't

10:17.807 --> 10:19.709
wear it all the time. I wear it when I'm out, but if I 
work in the yard or something, I don't wear it. But

10:22.994 --> 10:24.035
it's pretty warm. And I couldn't afford a diamond 
in it, of course. I still don't have a diamond in it.

10:31.004 --> 10:33.327
Okay, going on quickly. A

10:33.467 --> 10:42.178
wonderful thing happened to me, as far as I was 
concerned, for my own career and future career.

10:43.053 --> 10:52.987
About that time, they organized a new office of 
training program here, Army Security Agency. I

10:53.007 --> 10:54.028
don't know if you've ever heard of that. It's 
intelligence stuff. And I guess it was a

10:56.131 --> 10:57.994
challenge. If you were made to take an IQ test, and 
if you had a certain level of IQ, you were

10:58.114 --> 11:04.302
acceptable. And at that time, there were only 
three schools offering the program, MIT,

11:04.362 --> 11:10.631
University of Illinois, and Texas A&M. Hmm. And so 
they organized a new unit, Army Security. The

11:15.693 --> 11:27.866
first year, we weren't, enough of us, or there 
weren't any seniors, we were part of the signal

11:15.693 --> 11:27.866
company, because it was related to signal 
activities. So we were juniors in the signal

11:28.387 --> 11:30.569
company. But then my senior year, we became a 
company to ourselves, and it may be because of this

11:31.210 --> 11:37.377
academic thing, We were the first one ever to win 
the George Moore Award. Oh, really? Yeah, this

11:41.449 --> 11:42.910
Army Security Agency. But I said there was a kind of 
pre-selected group that went into that. But I was

11:47.014 --> 11:52.479
really excited about getting into that program as 
an ROTC, and I made a commitment. You had to make a

11:52.499 --> 11:53.420
commitment. Of course, I needed the money, too. At 
the end of your junior year, you had to decide

11:55.422 --> 12:01.288
whether you were going to get a contract, as they 
called it. It was $21 a month, which was necessary,

12:01.308 --> 12:05.592
helpful. and provided you additional uniforms, 
and of course that obligated you to take four years

12:06.044 --> 12:19.084
of the ROTC in that particular branch and do a 
summer camp, as you know, a six-week summer camp

12:06.044 --> 12:19.084
between your junior and senior year. So that's 
what happened in the junior year. I moved to

12:24.352 --> 12:30.481
Dormitory 11 the first year as part of the Signal 
Corps, and the next year we wore our own outfit. Did

12:30.501 --> 12:32.524
that outfit have a nickname? that intelligence 
outfit? No, maybe behind our backs we did that. We

12:38.213 --> 12:39.896
were part of a composite battalion. I was, you 
know, from the background I had, any rank or

12:39.936 --> 12:46.928
achievement you made was highly honored. I did 
make the battalion staff, I guess I became a

12:46.968 --> 12:54.360
captain as a senior, and We were part of the 
composite staff, which included the specialized

12:54.695 --> 13:01.001
units like the signal core and chemical core. 
Because I'm assuming that that outfit was kind of a

13:01.381 --> 13:05.365
scheme of the crop, wasn't it? Well, it was because 
you had to take the IQ test to score a certain level

13:05.645 --> 13:11.030
on that. I don't know, there were some interviews 
and things like that, but it was a selected group.

13:15.854 --> 13:22.120
And we actually got to go to, during our summer 
camp, we went to Fort Meade and we actually went

13:15.854 --> 13:22.120
to... what do they call those barracks out of 
Washington where this very famous code breaker

13:22.741 --> 13:48.057
during World War II visited with us and I can't 
think of his name but he was mostly involved in

13:22.741 --> 13:48.057
breaking codes and ciphers and it took I mean 
you've got these problems and they were you know

13:22.741 --> 13:48.057
like 400 crossword puzzles wrapped up into one 
because you had to you know study the frequency of

13:22.741 --> 13:48.057
the letters try to figure out patterns. And of 
course they've got machines to do all that

13:49.764 --> 13:52.126
nowadays. And we hadn't started using machines 
then. But I'm trying to think of the name of the

13:54.849 --> 13:58.532
barracks. It's in the Pentagon area. I mean, it was 
Arlington Farms. Arlington Farms, I guess they

14:03.617 --> 14:05.759
called it. It was kind of a secret area. But we felt 
very well. The other thing that happened my junior

14:12.885 --> 14:18.330
year, they started to reactivate the Ross 
Volunteers that year. So I opted for that, which

14:18.800 --> 14:24.507
was time-consuming, but I liked the concept. But 
we didn't do a whole lot because we were just

14:24.527 --> 14:27.991
getting organized. How many were selected, as far 
as you recall, then? Well, it was based on

14:31.315 --> 14:35.881
academics and... No, no, but how many students? 
Well, it was a company. There are pictures in

14:37.603 --> 14:38.684
there. I would say in the books, I guess maybe 40 or 
50. I'm not sure. And as far as you're aware, the

14:43.730 --> 14:48.756
selection of the RVs then was based on their What 
were the factors? I'm not sure. I think academics

14:51.813 --> 15:00.783
entered into it, recommendations of your 
military ROTC instructors, these type of things.

15:01.925 --> 15:09.714
And it was probably time consuming too, but I think 
we drilled about an hour a day most days. And I had

15:09.834 --> 15:18.304
special roles to play in football games, but both 
during my junior and senior year, we didn't have

15:09.834 --> 15:18.304
all the fancy New Orleans trips. The only exciting 
thing we did is during my senior year, we were the

15:18.706 --> 15:27.558
honor guard for the governor when we played the 
University of Texas over in Austin. Who was the

15:27.798 --> 15:28.839
governor then? Was this Coke Stevenson? No, it 
was... Buford Jester? Jester, that's who it was. I

15:34.667 --> 15:36.389
think it was, yeah, I think it was. And they 
described the uniform, make believe I'd never

15:36.410 --> 15:39.674
seen it. Well, they've changed since then. They 
got, I mean, it was very cheap. It was white, but it

15:45.141 --> 15:48.105
was duck cloth. like we used for cotton sacks. Did 
it have the... Yeah, high collar, but it was a very,

15:50.641 --> 15:58.393
I mean, it only cost $20 or $25, but it was a cheap 
type of thing. I'm sure they got, but it was part of

15:58.413 --> 16:03.962
the financial situation at the time, but it was a 
white uniform. And we had the silver plated

16:04.342 --> 16:11.714
rifles, you know, that we played with and did 
the... And black shoes? Probably, I don't know, I

16:13.577 --> 16:15.460
can't remember. You know about the boot duration, 
how important that is. Anyway, getting back to

16:20.201 --> 16:44.755
that, to finishing off my career, as I said, I had 
enough credits to graduate a semester early, but

16:20.201 --> 16:44.755
then I got committed to Army security, and I had to 
stay an extra semester to get my contract at the end

16:20.201 --> 16:44.755
of my second half of my senior year, which I really 
enjoyed because I had all my requirements except

16:20.201 --> 16:44.755
that, So I jumped back and took all the courses I 
always wanted to take as electives and never had

16:45.072 --> 16:49.919
room for. I always felt my education had not been 
complete because I never had had trigonometry in

16:50.319 --> 16:58.411
high school or in college, so I took trigonometry. 
What else? I can't remember all. I took German

17:00.734 --> 17:03.158
because I had a little German background. I 
thought, well, might as well take that. I took a

17:05.681 --> 17:09.747
technical writing course because I took another 
option earlier than that. And I think there were

17:10.486 --> 17:15.834
one or two animal science courses that weren't 
required that I took, but anyway. Now, had German

17:16.215 --> 17:19.139
been spoken at home by your family? To a limited 
extent. It had been spoken at home pretty much. I

17:28.153 --> 17:31.178
guess I knew German better than English when I 
started school. In fact, I often get accused of not

17:32.560 --> 17:37.067
being Texan in my, having English as a second 
language and with the grandparents and relatives

17:39.730 --> 18:06.126
who talked German but my parents made a real effort 
to talk English after I started school even though

17:39.730 --> 18:06.126
their English you know even till the day they died 
wasn't as good as it might have been I mean they had

17:39.730 --> 18:06.126
accents and so forth but they I mean about the time I 
started school English started they started

17:39.730 --> 18:06.126
speaking English all the time at home which was 
probably good for me but I I always thought, well,

18:06.629 --> 18:16.666
I'd had that little start in it, and one of the 
reasons I selected it as one of my languages in the

18:06.629 --> 18:16.666
old days when you had to have languages for... But 
that was a mistake, because I was in Wisconsin.

18:18.950 --> 18:20.533
They had the toughest German department. Oh, 
yeah. And the French and the Spanish guys just

18:21.715 --> 18:24.500
breezed through it. The German department wanted 
you really to be able to read, which was a shock.

18:30.811 --> 18:32.113
They... All right, now I kind of gather that this 
intelligence outfit was a spark to you. Well, it

18:39.922 --> 18:43.528
was something we really enjoyed. I mean, you felt 
you were somewhat as an elitist, I guess. All

18:47.415 --> 18:55.350
right, by then, by the time you're taking those 
courses you really wanted to take that spring of

18:47.415 --> 18:55.350
your fourth year, Had you zeroed in more surely on 
what you wanted to do? Well, I was almost enamored

18:59.352 --> 19:02.738
with a military career by that time. I mean, in 
fact, I had, I even had toyed with the idea of West

19:02.918 --> 19:20.308
Point somewhere along the line, either between my 
sophomore and junior year, and I started going in

19:02.918 --> 19:20.308
that direction until I had my ROTC physical here, 
and I found out I was nearsighted. And at that time,

19:20.508 --> 19:23.491
West Point would not accept you unless you were 
20-20. I think they do now, I understand. It's

19:25.893 --> 19:26.693
ridiculous. It's easily correctable. But I was 
told I would not be eligible, which, you know, I

19:28.275 --> 19:35.120
might have gone to a military career because I 
really got turned on by the military activity. And

19:35.821 --> 19:37.082
he talked about professors. There was a Major 
Jones assigned here who was the lone officer for

19:37.102 --> 19:41.286
Army Security. He had been a signal officer but 
retraded as an Army Security because the work that

19:41.306 --> 19:50.093
Army Security did during the war had been done by 
the Signal Corps. But it had gotten so important,

19:50.478 --> 19:54.363
code breaking and traffic analysis. Are you 
familiar with that? Communication, where you

19:55.425 --> 19:59.350
listen to radio and you position units where they 
are. They call it order battle, all that. They made

20:01.934 --> 20:04.958
a separate branch out of it, intelligence branch. 
Anyway, I was really beginning to think in terms of

20:05.138 --> 20:11.487
a military career, and I guess I hadn't ruled it 
out. And this Major Jones, I guess, gave me the best

20:17.562 --> 20:19.224
advice I ever had. I mean, he didn't particularly 
encourage, at that time, it was between the World

20:19.264 --> 20:30.920
War II and the Korean War, he encouraged my 
participation in the reserves. He said, why don't

20:31.320 --> 20:37.408
you go civilian, you can still keep up your 
military interest. And the conventional wisdom

20:37.428 --> 20:42.875
of the guys, my peers, don't get into the reserves. 
Worst thing you could do, because you'll be the

20:42.996 --> 20:45.419
first to go. And, uh, But this guy gave me the best 
piece of advice, and he said, you know, from my

20:47.482 --> 21:03.078
perspective, at my age, he said, you ought to stay 
in there to earn the retirement benefits, because

20:47.482 --> 21:03.078
he said, you'll find that time will go on anyway. 
And so I was one of the very few who opted for active

21:05.020 --> 21:16.172
reserve duty after I got my commission, which, 
unexpectedly, kept me from having to go to Korea.

21:19.597 --> 21:28.970
Because, you know, when a year after we graduated, 
I was already participating in reserve

21:19.597 --> 21:28.970
activities down at Fort Crockett in Galveston. 
We'd have weekend trainings and things like that.

21:31.854 --> 21:33.997
I remember being down there when the Korean War 
broke out. And we were all expecting

21:34.617 --> 21:39.804
to be called immediately. And that's what 
happened. The ones who did not commit to the

21:43.355 --> 21:44.817
reserves. These were the guys that they called 
out, and they retraded them all as infantry

21:45.357 --> 21:49.542
officers. They were platoon leaders. In fact, I 
met a person who lives in this community who was in a

21:51.244 --> 22:04.138
subsequent, I think the following year, the 
people that graduated right at that time, I guess

21:51.244 --> 22:04.138
the class of 50, I was 49. They were 36, I think he 
said. No, maybe, it doesn't matter. Anyway, at the

22:10.445 --> 22:13.328
time they got their commission half were sent to 
Korea, half were sent to Germany. And the half that

22:19.056 --> 22:22.179
were sent to Korea, there was not a single 
survivor. These had been Army security people who

22:22.539 --> 22:25.442
had been retrented. But I, in fact, my career was 
beginning to hinge on that, and my marriage and

22:26.303 --> 22:33.909
everything else, you know, I expected to go any 
time. And they kept saying, you stay with the unit.

22:36.432 --> 22:37.993
We'll call you as a unit when we want. You'll 
probably be called. And, you know, we kept, and it

22:39.074 --> 22:41.876
was that status. It was down at El Campo where I 
belonged to a, replacement unit and we in fact we

22:44.408 --> 23:03.917
were on call at least twice I mean alert and then 
they backed down on it for some reason or the other

22:44.408 --> 23:03.917
but I continued my reserve activities for 30 years 
and earned retirement benefits and Major Jones

22:44.408 --> 23:03.917
was right the time went on anyway. Alright your 
senior spring describe final review

23:12.235 --> 23:16.219
commencement for you and your family, your loved 
ones. Wonderful experience. Last semester was

23:17.881 --> 23:28.032
the first year at a time I really had fun because I 
was doing the courses I wanted and at that time too

23:17.881 --> 23:28.032
you know seniors were exempt, graduating seniors 
were exempt from finals. That was nice. You still

23:31.236 --> 23:40.926
want to make a good grade but you didn't have to 
worry about finals and particularly that week, I

23:31.236 --> 23:40.926
guess a week or so before last classes and And 
graduation, that was really a fun week. We could

23:43.728 --> 23:45.190
harass everybody else. But I remember my senior 
review in a very interesting way. We had the gosh

23:53.541 --> 23:58.387
awfulest downpour of rain you can ever imagine. I 
can remember the guy with the bass horns pouring

23:58.567 --> 24:01.110
water. Really? I mean, it was absolutely monsoon 
rain the whole time. Everybody got soaked to the,

24:09.256 --> 24:15.404
And the graduation was in Caulfield, and 
everybody got pretty wet. And I guess it was

24:16.346 --> 24:28.762
meaningful to me at that time, as graduation was 
commissioning, because I guess I was the first one

24:16.346 --> 24:28.762
from my community and family that ever got... Who 
came from your family? My parents, I think,

24:29.804 --> 24:31.866
basically. I think that was it, my parents. Now, 
you hadn't met this special young lady yet? No. No.

24:38.652 --> 24:39.713
No, that came later. Your senior boots, where'd 
you get them and what'd you pay for them? Oh, they

24:43.616 --> 24:44.457
were secondhand. I got them from the boot shop. 
Hollick's? Hollick's, the boot shop, and they

24:47.580 --> 24:49.982
were secondhand and they never fit. Any blisters? 
Yeah, but I just wore them on ceremonial

24:52.784 --> 25:00.571
occasions, but it would have been nice if I could 
have, I think I probably paid $20 or $30 for them. I

25:00.651 --> 25:03.474
think you ones were close, even at that time, close 
to $100. Did you sell them back to them? Oh, yes. I

25:05.996 --> 25:08.338
probably bought what I paid for them, but they 
never did fit. Anyway, I'll have to tell you one

25:08.622 --> 25:11.645
other story about the boots. Of course, that's a 
very proud moment when you can put those boots on,

25:12.827 --> 25:33.870
and we were stupid enough or young enough, 
whatever you want, the 15 or 20 of us that were in

25:12.827 --> 25:33.870
this Army Security Unit were sent to Fort Meade, 
Maryland, so we could go to Washington, D.C. and

25:12.827 --> 25:33.870
participate and look at some of those 
intelligence activities. Everybody else went

25:34.390 --> 25:37.093
to, I think, to... I mean, the infantry, artillery 
people all went to like, what's the base in

25:37.613 --> 25:44.760
Oklahoma? Fort Sill? Fort Sill, or Port Hood, or 
some of those places, and we got to go to the exotic

25:46.342 --> 25:55.131
New York, or rather, Maryland.

25:57.314 --> 26:00.997
My father had finally gotten a new car after the 
war. It was just summer of 48. and he was going to

26:03.770 --> 26:06.653
dump his old Hudson Terraplane. And I said, well, 
let me have it. So two colleagues of mine, one in

26:09.215 --> 26:21.706
Houston and one in San Antonio, the three of us 
drove to Maryland and participated at Fort Meade

26:09.215 --> 26:21.706
there. And what I'm leading up to is we had the 
weekend two or three days off at 4th of July. So we

26:29.753 --> 26:31.315
drove to New York City. None of us had ever been out 
of state before. And we wore our boots, of course.

26:38.197 --> 26:42.163
We stayed, I think, five or six to a hotel room to cut 
down expenses. And I remember two things. Well,

26:44.886 --> 26:49.793
the main thing I remember was riding the boat out to 
the Statue of Liberty. And, of course, there were a

26:50.834 --> 26:53.518
bunch of high school girls along there. We found 
out they were from Brooklyn, and we gave them our

26:53.538 --> 26:58.084
attention, and they gave us their attention. And 
one of them just finally couldn't contain

26:58.845 --> 27:01.088
herself. She said, geez, what's with the boots? 
Ha! I said, this guy's talk's funny. And that was

27:06.594 --> 27:09.857
very shocking to us. All right. As you graduated,

27:10.998 --> 27:17.945
what kind of world did you think you were entering? 
And how well prepared did you think A&M had made

27:18.686 --> 27:21.348
you? Well, I was, as I said, totally, I came back to 
my earlier commitment of wanting to be a county

27:21.748 --> 27:27.834
agent. And I started working that pretty hard for 
my last year. And it turned out that with all the

27:33.832 --> 27:42.160
veterans graduating and everything, they had a 
lot of candidates for jobs. And I think they told me

27:42.480 --> 27:48.266
later for four, five, six openings they had, they 
had over 100 applicants. But the Extension

27:48.866 --> 27:52.790
headquarters used to be in the Military Science 
Building. Did you know that? And then the

27:54.111 --> 27:57.434
Experiment Station was over here, what they call 
the Butler Building now. All the Extension people

27:57.995 --> 28:01.358
were in one building, including the director and 
everybody else. And I worked that very, very hard

28:02.148 --> 28:08.077
trying to be sure I'd get the position. And one of 
the funnies that kind of reminds you of the

28:08.378 --> 28:20.958
military of putting you where you're least 
qualified, I remember filling out the

28:08.378 --> 28:20.958
application form. And that stayed on the form a 
long time after. There was a rule in extension

28:24.237 --> 28:33.632
service you couldn't work in your home county, 
which is probably a good rule, because you'd

28:24.237 --> 28:33.632
always be old man Jones' little kid. But that was 
one rule. You could work anywhere. And I was

28:36.437 --> 28:37.579
filling out this form. It was about a four-page 
form of a little background and everything. Got

28:41.425 --> 28:44.270
the question, what part of the state would you 
prefer to work in? And I, desperate for a job, I

28:45.431 --> 28:48.016
said, anywhere. But I remember turning to the 
secretary and I said, I put that on there, I said,

28:50.917 --> 28:57.544
but I hope they don't send me to the Rice area, 
because that's one thing I don't know anything

28:50.917 --> 28:57.544
about. Uh-oh, uh-oh. You know my first county. The 
second county were both Rice counties. Which

29:03.531 --> 29:04.051
county? Wharton and, well, I was assistant agent 
in Wharton and county agent in Matagorda, Bay

29:04.071 --> 29:10.158
City. When did that, when did you begin that? Well, 
I graduated around the first of the, June, as I

29:19.283 --> 29:20.585
recall. I had my commission, I had my degree, and I 
had been selected for a training position, not a

29:21.967 --> 29:39.610
regular position, a training position in the 
Extension Service, and that was just kind of for

29:21.967 --> 29:39.610
you to get, until they had more openings and could 
observe you a little bit to see whether you'd fit

29:21.967 --> 29:39.610
the organization. And I was, I remember working 
with the district supervisor who employed me for

29:40.572 --> 29:46.860
that job, I wanted to go to work the week Monday 
after I graduated. He said, look, take a week off at

29:51.227 --> 29:54.533
least. You're never going to do it again. Anyway, 
he talked me into that. And I think it was on the 10th

29:59.862 --> 30:04.931
of June, I was sent as an agent in training, which 
was $2,600. I'd have a car. to work in, I guess they

30:08.812 --> 30:15.480
did that as a favor to me, to work in the neighboring 
county, Seguin, in Guadalupe County. And there

30:16.081 --> 30:23.751
was a county agent there that I very much admired, 
Bill Rector, who was my first, and I only worked

30:16.081 --> 30:23.751
there about six weeks. And then they transferred 
me as a training person to Beeville, Bee County.

30:30.379 --> 30:37.148
And I worked, they were trying, the Extension 
Service was trying to get that county to put up the

30:30.379 --> 30:37.148
money for an assistant position, and I started 
going in that direction. But in September of that

30:41.799 --> 30:58.394
year I got a call from another supervisor from the 
Gulf Coast who had an opening in Wharton, a regular

30:41.799 --> 30:58.394
position, assistant county agent position in 
Wharton County, which was the Rice County. And so I

30:58.414 --> 31:02.878
accepted that position, which was a regular 
position. And, well, you can see it on there. I

31:05.320 --> 31:07.202
worked in that position for about a year and a half, 
and then I went to Michigan State because I felt my

31:08.515 --> 31:20.469
future would be enhanced in the extension service 
if I had gotten at least a master's degree. And I

31:20.990 --> 31:25.215
also had subscribed to the notion that I didn't 
want to go directly into graduate school. I

31:25.255 --> 31:27.518
thought it was good to get a little experience in 
between. And I figured that after two years,

31:28.359 --> 31:36.328
usually at that time, if you successfully had 
about two years of assistant agent, you were ready

31:28.359 --> 31:36.328
for it. agent position, I thought well if I'm ever 
going to get an education it would be better to do it

31:37.085 --> 31:41.543
between those two.
