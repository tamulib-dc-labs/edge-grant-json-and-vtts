00:03.710 --> 00:11.882
This is an interview with Leland C. Johnson by 
Tracy L. Swope on 4 December in Temple concerning

00:03.710 --> 00:11.882
the Vietnam War. In the interest of accumulating 
knowledge about the war, I'm going to donate this

00:12.543 --> 00:19.493
tape to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection in 
the University Archives. Is this all right with

00:19.974 --> 00:20.875
you? Yes.

00:24.701 --> 00:29.448
If you would, please, give us some background on 
where you were born, where you went to school, and

00:24.701 --> 00:29.448
how you joined the service. I was raised in 
Colorado. pretty much on a farm. My father had

00:34.986 --> 00:43.614
spent several years in the Air Force, well, the 
Army when he started in the Air Force when he got

00:34.986 --> 00:43.614
out.

00:43.634 --> 00:49.580
I ran out of money my freshman year of college, and I 
couldn't find any part-time work. I could find

00:49.680 --> 00:55.846
lots of full-time work, and I ran into Master 
Sergeant Kingrey, who was the Army recruiter. I

00:57.648 --> 01:01.071
enlisted into the Army to go to the Warrant Flight 
Program while I was in basic training they set it up

01:02.705 --> 01:16.545
so that you enlisted directly into it and by the 
time I got out of basic training there was a two year

01:02.705 --> 01:16.545
waiting list to get into the program. I went to jump 
school and reported out to Okinawa to the 173rd

01:16.565 --> 01:25.277
Airborne Brigade separate as my first 
assignment. I made buck sergeant E-5, 22 minutes

01:26.539 --> 01:30.805
later for 22 months after going into the service 
and had applied for OCS.

01:41.062 --> 01:51.035
Got orders to go to Fort Benning, Georgia to the 
infantry officers candidate school in February

01:41.062 --> 01:51.035
of 1965. I

01:51.175 --> 01:57.383
was commissioned in August of 1965 While I was in 
OCS, the 173rd and the 3rd Marine Division

01:58.848 --> 02:06.800
deployed off of Okinawa to Vietnam. I requested 
relief from OCS to go back to my unit and it was

02:06.820 --> 02:16.775
denied after a long father to son counseling 
session with my company commander.

02:21.522 --> 02:26.830
Went out to Fort Bragg and assumed a platoon 
leader's job with the rifle company.

02:33.902 --> 02:44.498
Stayed on that for about 90 days and because of my 
prior enlisted experience with mortars and heavy

02:33.902 --> 02:44.498
weapons, I had moved up to the headquarters 
company and took over the heavy mortar platoon. On

02:47.021 --> 02:53.391
two occasions they took all my troops away from me 
except for myself, my platoon sergeant and one FDC

02:47.021 --> 02:53.391
sergeant and gave us kids right out of basic 
training to retrain. After having done that with

02:59.736 --> 03:09.008
the second batch and got them qualified, I managed 
to convince the Department of Army to send me to

02:59.736 --> 03:09.008
Vietnam. And I reported into Vietnam in July of 
1966

03:09.088 --> 03:22.604
with the first set of major replacements for the 
173rd.

03:23.365 --> 03:23.665
Go ahead. What was your feelings about flying in 
and realizing you were going into combat? I wanted

03:30.971 --> 03:31.732
to go. I volunteered. I was anxious to go.

03:37.037 --> 03:41.461
I had been in the Army at this point in time for about 
four years and had never been shot at. And we had

03:41.982 --> 03:48.628
done all these little maneuvers with blank 
ammunition and I wanted to see what it was like for

03:41.982 --> 03:48.628
real. Basically to see whether I had what it took.

03:56.888 --> 04:03.034
My initial experience getting shot at as a platoon 
leader was that you were too busy to be scared. It

04:03.395 --> 04:06.518
wasn't until after things got over with that you 
were scared.

04:09.581 --> 04:11.423
Where were you stationed in Vietnam? We operated 
primarily in three corps, in Rung Sat Special

04:12.104 --> 04:25.478
Zone, in Iron Triangle, and over close to the 
Cambodian border. At the end of that tour we moved

04:29.055 --> 04:39.947
up to two corps and relieved a brigade of the fourth 
division that was basically non-deployable.

04:45.694 --> 04:51.921
Which was, I left just before the 173rd lost a 
battalion

04:57.166 --> 05:01.571
off the mountain with two officers and 80 enlisted 
men left out of a whole battalion.

05:04.255 --> 05:06.778
What was your mission when you were there with your 
platoon? Well, early on we were primarily looking

05:08.120 --> 05:16.410
for Vietnamese

05:08.120 --> 05:16.410
guerrillas. And these were basically guys that 
were farmers in the daytime and guerrillas at

05:17.471 --> 05:21.456
night. And we beat them at their own game. We took a 
lot of casualties from booby traps, but we

05:27.001 --> 05:36.109
basically cleaned them out of the area that we were 
operating in. And it was towards the end of the tour

05:36.129 --> 05:43.096
that we started running into conventional forces 
or NVA regulars. And that's when the tone of the war

05:44.057 --> 05:47.340
changed a whole lot. They were bringing in outside 
supplies and outside personnel and bringing them

05:48.541 --> 05:56.248
down a Ho Chi Minh trail. It wasn't us against a 
bunch of farmers. It was us against

06:00.021 --> 06:05.187
well-disciplined, well-armed, well-equipped 
troops.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.614
What would an average day be there like?

06:13.737 --> 06:15.259
Stand two before first light.

06:20.365 --> 06:23.028
That would go until about 30 minutes after first 
light. We'd put out patrols, bring in our

06:23.649 --> 06:26.893
listening posts, Everybody would eat breakfast 
on the run, and then we would move. Sometimes we'd

06:33.342 --> 06:38.949
have something we were looking for, and sometimes 
we were just stumbling around in the jungle trying

06:33.342 --> 06:38.949
to see what we could stir up. We'd move all day long, 
sometimes as a unit, sometimes in small

06:41.713 --> 06:50.504
squad-sized

06:41.713 --> 06:50.504
patrols on a fan. Generally, we would not operate. 
We wouldn't move at night, although sometimes we

06:54.309 --> 06:56.712
did. and we'd dig in an hour before last night and 
put out listening posts. Many times we'd put out

07:05.380 --> 07:26.479
what they called Malaysian fan ambushes where I'd 
break my platoon down into a lot of four and five man

07:05.380 --> 07:26.479
ambush teams and we'd ambush a whole pattern of 
trails so that if they came in from any direction

07:05.380 --> 07:26.479
we'd have two or three separate ambushes that 
would catch them as they came through and we were

07:27.556 --> 07:36.026
able to interdict and kill a great many of the 
guerrilla forces. When we got into where we were

07:36.046 --> 07:51.924
doing battle with NVA, they operated in larger 
strength which caused us to change our tactics

07:36.046 --> 07:51.924
considerably and we had more platoon size 
ambushes than 4 and 5M ambushes. Do you remember

07:53.706 --> 07:56.449
your first day going out in the field? My first day, 
I reported them, dropped off my duffel bag, picked

07:56.682 --> 08:01.709
up a rucksack. The company was out in the field. I 
was handed two soldiers to take out to the field

08:06.696 --> 08:17.030
that had reported in late from R&R and had been 
somewhat reluctant to go back out to the field. And

08:18.792 --> 08:24.360
we hitchhiked, the helicopter rides out.

08:24.982 --> 08:32.692
delivered these two characters to the first 
sergeant, reported to my company commander, and

08:24.982 --> 08:32.692
by this time it's about four o'clock in the 
afternoon.

08:36.197 --> 08:43.406
Company commander tells me that I'm replacing a 
lieutenant who had just been shot, or stepped on a

08:36.197 --> 08:43.406
mine about seven or eight hours before. My platoon 
sergeant gives me a walk of our portion of the

08:46.030 --> 08:52.879
perimeter very hurriedly, and

08:57.263 --> 09:13.828
I can tell he's in some kind of a hurry, and I don't 
really understand why, but anyway, after we spend

08:57.263 --> 09:13.828
time and I ask questions about machine guns and 
placement and all that and decide he knows what

08:57.263 --> 09:13.828
he's doing, he allows us how I probably ought to put 
up my shelter for the night, which I did, and the

08:57.263 --> 09:13.828
only open piece of ground that was available.

09:18.315 --> 09:24.604
And about the time I got my shelter half put up, it 
commenced to rain like I had never seen it rain

09:18.315 --> 09:24.604
before in my whole life. And a little piece of 
ground that I had built my shelter around is not an

09:26.035 --> 09:31.583
open piece of ground, it's an intermittent 
stream. And I commenced to have all my worldly

09:32.545 --> 09:41.138
possessions float away in two feet of water while 
all the troops laugh at the new green lieutenant.

09:42.820 --> 09:46.686
And that was my introduction to Vietnam.

09:49.791 --> 09:51.233
Do you remember the first time you were fired off? 
You took fire?

09:55.921 --> 09:57.443
No, I can't really say as I do. Okay.

10:04.432 --> 10:05.934
How did you feel about the enlisted men? Did you 
develop a father-son type attitude, or? Well,

10:11.100 --> 10:13.663
understand that I was 20 years old at the time.

10:18.970 --> 10:19.731
I'll take that back. I had just turned 21 before I 
reported into Vietnam. My platoon sergeant was a

10:26.296 --> 10:40.599
guy I had known in Fort Bragg who was in the same 
company with me in the 82nd,

10:26.296 --> 10:40.599
who seemed to be older than Hills, I think he was 
probably 35 or 36.

10:43.724 --> 10:51.797
Most of the kids that were over there were 
volunteers at least to the airborne, if not

10:43.724 --> 10:51.797
volunteers to be in Vietnam and almost all of the 
officers and senior NCOs were volunteers on their

10:52.418 --> 10:58.106
first tour. Most of us were excited, we believed in 
what we were doing, we thought we were better than

10:59.448 --> 11:18.814
anybody else at it, and there was a close-knit 
camaraderie that you get with special units like

10:59.448 --> 11:18.814
Special Forces, Marine Force Recon, Airborne 
that were probably not typical of the average

11:19.435 --> 11:27.024
American infantry combat unit.

11:30.328 --> 11:32.771
We didn't have major discipline problems. We 
didn't have any drug problems.

11:38.998 --> 11:45.326
We had, by and large, T or any strength for NCOs, 
although there were a few shortages. And most of

11:46.087 --> 11:48.109
them were professional. Good quality. A lot of 
experience, although not in actual combat. They

11:55.159 --> 12:04.190
had years of leading troops and were technically 
very proficient in what they were doing.

12:04.210 --> 12:05.752
I'm not sure that answers your question. Yes it 
does. You were wounded over there, huh? Twice.

12:09.517 --> 12:11.499
Twice. Do you have some highlights on that? Once we 
were moving into Kordanoffa Village at night. It

12:18.143 --> 12:19.164
was raining. It's hard to describe in the United 
States how hard it can rain in Vietnam, but it

12:20.826 --> 12:28.734
literally was raining so hard that you could not 
see 15 feet. We were moving through the jungle and

12:29.775 --> 12:36.561
the water was about a foot deep on the ground when 
you get any kind of a low place. And we went in at

12:37.923 --> 12:41.667
night to move in and cordon off this village. 
Either I was lost or the company commander was

12:43.568 --> 12:47.172
lost, but we ended up dropping a 105 shell in my back 
pocket.

12:54.769 --> 13:04.318
I picked up a small piece of steel, and helicopters 
being what they were, I was in a hospital 45 minutes

12:54.769 --> 13:04.318
later, and they picked it out. Well, or tried to 
pick it out. The nurses weren't as competent there

13:08.122 --> 13:14.728
as they could have

13:08.122 --> 13:14.728
been. Ten days later I was out of the hospital and 
back with my platoon. The second time we had a

13:20.226 --> 13:29.938
Malaysian fan ambush out and we knew that there 
were a lot of NVA and guerrillas working in the

13:20.226 --> 13:29.938
area. I had my platoon busted down into five ambush 
teams on a series of trail intersections. In those

13:40.151 --> 13:44.597
days we had two radios per platoon and I had one and 
the platoon sergeant had one. but the ambushes on

13:45.472 --> 13:49.157
either side of me did not have a radio.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.964
Clouds were hanging down where it was fog. When 
you'd stand up, you were in the fog, and when you'd

13:55.004 --> 13:59.751
lay down on the ground, you could just barely see 
under. About 4 o'clock in the morning, the five of

14:00.612 --> 14:06.459
us caught what looked to be about a 10-man carrying 
party coming through our trail. And I opened up the

14:08.161 --> 14:13.268
ambush with full tracer, and everybody else 
started shooting. I could tell by the way one of

14:14.733 --> 14:19.038
them fell that he probably wasn't dead. And when it 
was all over, and I understand this whole

14:21.241 --> 14:37.780
interchange probably lasted about 20 seconds, I 
decided that we'd had the intelligence officer

14:21.241 --> 14:37.780
asking us for prisoners that probably could 
police this character up. And I went over in the

14:37.800 --> 14:43.086
dark, and I could see an outline of where he was 
laying in the dark. And I said something to him and

14:43.403 --> 14:48.528
he used it, which later I found I did not mean what I 
said I thought I did. And he shot me with a Sub

14:49.529 --> 14:51.170
Thompson.

14:54.713 --> 15:01.440
These TV westerns where you see where somebody 
gets shot with a .45 and he staggers around and

14:54.713 --> 15:01.440
gives his last will and testament is bullshit. I 
did a complete somersault in the air before I hit

15:02.541 --> 15:08.786
the ground and I probably weighed about 20 pounds 
less than I do now. But I was still about 200 pounds.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.332
It made me mad. I just, I got blind rage and I stood up 
and I put a whole magazine into him and I flipped it

15:17.353 --> 15:31.370
over and I put the other side of that magazine into 
him and I'm fumbling around in my ammo pouch to get a

15:17.353 --> 15:31.370
third magazine to put into him. When the 
adrenaline started coming down and reason

15:33.112 --> 15:41.963
started coming back and it dawned on me that I was 
standing out in front of my own ambush, blazing

15:33.112 --> 15:41.963
away, and I had no idea how many other of his guys 
were around,

15:42.770 --> 15:55.885
and I turned around and said, hold it, I'm coming 
back, it's me, and started to walk back. Well, my

15:56.025 --> 16:08.659
leg gave way on me at that point in time, and I 
crawled back to where I was at, and it was still

15:56.025 --> 16:08.659
dark, I had no medic with me, and I'm feeling around 
on my leg, trying to find out where I'm hit, because

15:56.025 --> 16:08.659
it's It doesn't really hurt. It feels like 
somebody hit you in the leg with a sledgehammer.

16:12.739 --> 16:16.024
You know it's going to hurt, but right now it's just 
numb. And I lose these three fingers up to the

16:17.066 --> 16:21.053
second knuckle. I said, well, it's probably just a 
flesh wound. And I get out my battle dressing and I

16:23.958 --> 16:27.103
put it on and tighten it off. And call in the company 
commander and tell him that we've had some contact

16:29.166 --> 16:34.495
and we've got several the enemy dead, and some rice 
and a few weapons, and we've got one wounded.

16:45.091 --> 16:49.037
And I'm trying to find a tackle way to tell him it's 
me again. And finally I get up the courage enough to

16:50.439 --> 16:59.694
tell him that it was this dumb lieutenant that 
managed to get himself shot again. And he said some

16:59.714 --> 17:01.917
words that we won't repeat on here. This time we had 
such overcast that we couldn't get a helicopter

17:04.327 --> 17:10.033
in, even after it got light. It was about noon 
before we could get a helicopter with a penetrator

17:10.053 --> 17:18.382
to come down through the canopy and get me out of 
there. But after it got light, what we found out was

17:20.384 --> 17:31.296
that the bullet had gone in here and had come out 
over here, and what I thought was just a grazing

17:20.384 --> 17:31.296
wound was the exit wound, and at 45 it left a pretty 
good sized hole. I was fortunate in that I did not

17:32.930 --> 17:35.793
lose my leg. They yanked me out of there and hauled 
me to the hospital and debrided it.

17:45.723 --> 17:50.008
And in about two weeks I got out of the hospital, 
although I wasn't walking too well. They had given

17:52.170 --> 18:01.620
my platoon over my ejections to another 
lieutenant who might have been fairly well.

18:03.828 --> 18:13.640
He managed to get himself seriously wounded about 
two weeks after that and was evacuated back to

18:03.828 --> 18:13.640
Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Denver. He got shot 
in the head and he was never really right after

18:15.422 --> 18:20.388
that. My platoon sergeant and I had a relationship 
that was somewhat unique. He was a

18:26.856 --> 18:29.599
Czechoslovakian. who had been policed up as a 
young boy in the Second World War with the German

18:30.760 --> 18:39.751
labor force. And during a B-17 raid over Germany, 
they had knocked a hole in the fence and he had

18:39.771 --> 18:51.605
managed to escape and steal a bicycle and evacuate 
E&E back to the British lines. He joined the

18:53.427 --> 18:57.612
British Army and spent two or three years with 
them. After a couple years with the British Army,

18:59.785 --> 19:08.318
Desation came to the United States and enlisted in 
the American Army. He spoke German with the Berlin

19:10.140 --> 19:28.628
Iraqis and Czechoslovakian and several other 
Slavic languages and they put him in civilian

19:10.140 --> 19:28.628
clothes and sent him back to Berlin with special 
forces and after several years at that he had ended

19:10.140 --> 19:28.628
up

19:10.140 --> 19:28.628
with me and Fort Bragg And he was an NCO acting as 
platoon leader and I was a lieutenant acting as

19:29.097 --> 19:33.584
platoon leader. And he used to beat me hands down at 
every damn thing we had for competition. We got to

19:39.053 --> 19:43.120
Vietnam and he ended up being my platoon sergeant. 
His English was about the only language he didn't

19:45.183 --> 19:48.829
have full command of. I was probably the only guy in 
the company that could understand him on the

19:49.249 --> 19:53.957
radio.

19:57.481 --> 20:15.198
He had a bit of a drinking problem, and we had sort of 
an unwritten agreement that when we came back out

19:57.481 --> 20:15.198
of the field, the first 48 hours were D's, and I 
would run the platoon, and he would go up in some

19:57.481 --> 20:15.198
corner and get blown away for two days, and then he 
would come back stone cold sober and function with

19:57.481 --> 20:15.198
the platoon. If there was any time left over, I got 
to goof off. Unfortunately, when I briefed my

20:19.762 --> 20:27.049
lieutenant replacement on that, and he 
understood it, But when he got shot, we got a new

20:27.940 --> 20:31.285
company commander by the same time. And he called 
Dee in during the first 48 hours. Dee showed up at a

20:37.273 --> 20:50.812
company commander's briefing for an operation, 
three sheets to the wind, and it took everything I

20:37.273 --> 20:50.812
could muster to keep him from getting 
court-martialed. Dee later retired as a first

20:50.832 --> 20:54.758
sergeant, but it took a lot of maneuvering to keep 
him from getting court-martialed after showing

20:55.126 --> 21:04.941
up at that damn briefing.

21:04.961 --> 21:14.335
My relationships with the troops were probably 
not as close, although you felt it was a family.

21:19.282 --> 21:22.467
You ate the same food they did, you suffered the 
same hardships they did, You knew their girls and

21:23.729 --> 21:27.516
their wives and how many kids they had. And when one 
of them got hurt, you hurt.

21:33.706 --> 21:37.653
I don't think Vietnam was unique in that. Any 
combat environment where you've got a group of men

21:37.793 --> 21:49.213
that are strongly dependent upon each other for 
their very existence, you get that kind of a

21:37.793 --> 21:49.213
bonding.

21:54.020 --> 21:57.663
Did you have Vietnamese in your platoon, and if so, 
how did you feel about them? First tour, I didn't

21:57.683 --> 21:59.885
have any Vietnamese in my platoon. I went back as a 
company commander, second tour. When was? Let's

22:04.490 --> 22:15.120
see, I went back in July of 67

22:04.490 --> 22:15.120
for my second tour, and I was a company commander. I 
had Ket Carson scouts. Now, this time I was with the

22:20.064 --> 22:22.947
1st Air Cavalry Division, and we were operating up 
in I-Corps and it went from the Street Without Joy

22:23.551 --> 22:33.281
area on the beach all the way back into the Esho 
Valley.

22:37.586 --> 22:50.419
We had kit cars and scouts which were supposedly 
NVA that we had captured or guerrillas that we had

22:37.586 --> 22:50.419
captured and they had seen the light and now they 
were going to come work for us.

22:53.470 --> 22:59.178
Some of them were good, some of them were 
dangerous. We used them as interpreters, we used

23:01.401 --> 23:18.145
them to

23:01.401 --> 23:18.145
help give us a feel for what the NVA were likely to 
do, especially when we got into bunker complexes

23:01.401 --> 23:18.145
or something like that, they had a better feel and 
understanding

23:24.453 --> 23:25.434
you know, within the unit. We did not have 
integrated units.

23:32.883 --> 23:34.825
When you were there the second time, it was after 
tech. Did you run into a drug or racial problem

23:34.845 --> 23:41.272
there?

23:41.292 --> 23:52.165
There's always been some racial problems in the 
services, because we draw our people out of

23:41.292 --> 23:52.165
civilian life, and they bring all of the emotional 
baggage into the military with them. I think that

23:55.593 --> 24:07.770
probably the services do a better job at putting 
everybody on an equal status than do most of the

23:55.593 --> 24:07.770
civilian environments, but yeah there was some 
racial problems there. Not to the point where we

24:08.511 --> 24:12.577
had conflict.

24:15.301 --> 24:19.206
My first sergeant was black.

24:20.608 --> 24:22.050
Some of my NCOs were black.

24:25.051 --> 24:27.994
a number of my troops were black, a number of them 
were Hispanic. The only real problems we had were

24:30.196 --> 24:35.802
part of McNamara's 100,000.

24:39.345 --> 24:43.009
Those weren't all black though, they were 
predominantly black because they came in. Do you

24:43.049 --> 24:45.731
understand what McNamara's 100,000 is? Okay. 
We're talking about kids who are one standard

24:47.053 --> 24:54.400
deviation below the mean in terms of 
intelligence, predominantly from inner cities,

24:55.628 --> 25:14.793
predominantly minorities, a lot of them with a 
chip on their shoulder,

24:55.628 --> 25:14.793
and because of their lack of any educational 
skills or skills of any kind, the biggest part of

24:55.628 --> 25:14.793
them ended up in the combat arms.

25:18.197 --> 25:23.644
Most of them felt they'd been put in the combat arms 
because they were being picked on, in most cases

25:24.029 --> 25:52.129
they had been put in the combat harness because 
they couldn't qualify for anything else

25:24.029 --> 25:52.129
we had some problems with them but nothing that 
causes any real loss of effectiveness in the

25:24.029 --> 25:52.129
company if we had any drug problems and i'm not 
naive enough to say that we didn't i was not aware of

25:24.029 --> 25:52.129
it while i was a company commander predominantly 
because My kids came in, they dropped their duffel

25:52.970 --> 26:00.618
bags, we picked up a rucksack and they never saw 
Civilization again until they went on R&R. They

26:01.118 --> 26:04.101
got one five day R&R in a year. And that was their 
only real opportunity to buy drugs unless it was

26:06.343 --> 26:15.533
being mailed in and we did a pretty good job of 
keeping tabs on the mail. I was there when the mail

26:15.553 --> 26:22.960
chompers came in and it was, you could see what was 
going on.

26:23.952 --> 26:29.678
If anybody brought any grass or anything back, 
they didn't bring back enough to last them very

26:23.952 --> 26:29.678
long. And I really believe that most of my troops 
would not have tolerated that in a combat

26:30.579 --> 26:37.546
environment. And they didn't get back to a base 
camp operation.

26:43.592 --> 26:52.120
The drug problems that became so famous in Vietnam 
were predominantly around rear area units and

26:52.893 --> 26:58.622
units that operated out of a base camp most of the 
time. And we just did not have access. We stayed out

27:01.747 --> 27:03.630
in no man's land.

27:16.510 --> 27:17.691
You left the second time. How did you feel about 
leaving your men behind, or even the first time?

27:24.685 --> 27:32.135
Well,

27:24.685 --> 27:32.135
rotation was an ongoing process. And in the period 
of a year, you'd see your whole unit change.

27:44.310 --> 27:45.392
It was everybody's time. After I spent seven 
months with the company, I left the company. and

27:53.356 --> 27:57.582
went to the battalion to serve as the intelligence 
officer. So I hadn't really left them then as much

27:57.602 --> 28:03.170
as I had moved across the street from the 
battalion. My departure from the company as the

28:03.190 --> 28:20.916
company commander was somewhat traumatic in that 
I was due to rotate and go on R&R and then come back

28:03.190 --> 28:20.916
and assume the position of the battalion S-2.

28:22.246 --> 28:34.563
They had a new West Point captain that was coming in 
to take the company and the battalion commander

28:22.246 --> 28:34.563
came down and said he wanted to delay my R&R by two or 
three days so that I could go out and take one last

28:22.246 --> 28:34.563
mission.

28:37.787 --> 28:46.279
The guys in G2 had developed some radio intercepts 
and some hotspots that they wanted me to go check

28:37.787 --> 28:46.279
out with my company. And I said, yeah, that was no 
problem, but I wanted to go on R&R, and the old man

28:48.436 --> 29:07.175
said that he would let me have his helicopter to get 
to Da Nang a couple hours before the flight left, so

28:48.436 --> 29:07.175
that I could make R&R on schedule, because Jerry 
had already left the States.

29:07.195 --> 29:17.565
Well, we C8 in to a Colville Z and started moving to 
where the radio intercepts were.

29:19.857 --> 29:26.547
We ran into an old bunker complex that hadn't been 
used for looked like a year or two. And then as we

29:26.567 --> 29:38.925
proceeded on farther north, all probably a 
quarter of a mile to half a mile, we started running

29:26.567 --> 29:38.925
into newer construction. Simultaneously to my 
moving north, we had an assister company that was

29:40.648 --> 29:45.896
moving down to the south. It was lost. and they were 
reporting their position very close to me. And I

29:51.297 --> 30:02.571
had put out the word to my point elements to 
identify positively before they fired on

29:51.297 --> 30:02.571
anything because we had one of our own companies 
moving in. About that time, my point element

30:04.072 --> 30:10.060
reported that they were affecting link-up. What 
we linked up with, unfortunately, was an NVA

30:12.122 --> 30:17.168
regiment One company, which was in American 
uniforms, had American equipment, had newer

30:17.502 --> 30:24.873
American equipment than I had. And I lost a whole 
platoon in about 30 seconds. After that, they

30:30.222 --> 30:35.230
maneuvered on us. And I had basically two line 
platoons and a mortar platoon.

30:45.633 --> 30:51.340
and we did battle with what was the better part of a 
regiment for about four hours.

30:55.966 --> 31:11.024
Fortunately, we brought in the air cab, the first 
cab division that had what they called aerial

30:55.966 --> 31:11.024
rocket artillery, which was a process for using 
gunship very much the way Marines use close air

30:55.966 --> 31:11.024
support, because we were out of conventional 
artillery range.

31:13.867 --> 31:14.408
We got gunship support and as I am trying to 
evacuate the rest of my wounded back out

31:16.598 --> 31:44.226
understand we made initial contact about one 
o'clock in the afternoon it gets dark over there at

31:16.598 --> 31:44.226
that time of the year about six and about 430 I have 
gotten most of my wounded out I've got three dead

31:16.598 --> 31:44.226
that are unaccounted for but I'm 95% sure I did

31:48.121 --> 32:02.122
I've got myself, my artillery, forward observer, 
one medic, and my two RTOs

31:48.121 --> 32:02.122
with me. I've lost one of my lieutenants who got 
shot as close to me as I'm sitting to you. One of my

32:10.315 --> 32:16.204
lieutenants who is the one of about four or five 
survivors out of this lead platoon that made the

32:16.420 --> 32:20.426
link up is virtually ineffective. He's kind of 
gone off the deep end. And I've got one lieutenant

32:25.234 --> 32:33.046
that wasn't real functional. He had the mortar 
platoon and he was he was scared. We've gotten all

32:40.057 --> 32:43.643
of them back and we're getting ready to withdraw 
because we've been laying down covering fires,

32:43.893 --> 32:49.119
the rest of the company, and they closed behind us. 
So now I've got about the six of us surrounded. By

32:56.928 --> 32:59.811
this time, it is about 545 in the afternoon. It is 
just about dark, and two more ARA birds come on the

32:59.891 --> 33:04.196
station. We're unfortunate in that we're in a 
little bitty depression, about 18 inches deep and

33:06.078 --> 33:12.465
kind of an intermittent stream. And he comes on and 
I said, I need you to lay these rockets about 10 feet

33:14.099 --> 33:22.170
on either side of me. And I had a little strobe light 
so he could see me. And he said, I can't lay it that

33:26.175 --> 33:27.998
close. And I said, if you don't, it's not going to 
make any difference. And he said, OK, I'm rolling

33:32.864 --> 33:34.547
hot. And he brought those two birds in and put those 
rockets down like he laid a chalk line and just laid

33:34.687 --> 33:42.317
a string out of each side of that thing. wingman 
came in right behind him and we picked up and hauled

33:42.652 --> 33:46.696
ass. And that's the only reason I'm here today.

33:52.022 --> 33:52.963
Tremendous job. Those guys

33:54.125 --> 33:59.771
really did a great job. Anyway, we got back to where 
the rest of the company was. We had cut a place where

34:02.935 --> 34:12.405
we could evacuate our wounded from and the rest of 
what was left of us wagon wheeled and licked our

34:02.935 --> 34:12.405
wounds. and they dumped 2,000 rounds of artillery 
into that place that night, and the next morning

34:13.482 --> 34:23.233
three companies moved into the area. Most of the 
NVA had evacuated, but what we found was the

34:24.174 --> 34:30.220
staging area for the 69 tele-offensive. It didn't 
happen, because we stumbled into the staging area

34:31.021 --> 34:35.225
for it. Now, they weren't prepared to do another 
68, but they were going to do a 69. We found A

34:43.182 --> 34:50.608
whole headquarters complete with radios and 
mimeograph machines. They hauled rockets and

34:50.628 --> 35:00.897
stuff out of there for a week and then they finally 
blew what was left in place because I couldn't

34:50.628 --> 35:00.897
afford any more blade time to haul it out. But, it 
cost me 52 guys out of my company. You know, they

35:09.124 --> 35:12.767
weren't all dead, but either dead or wounded. 52 
guys. Now, I normally went to the field with

35:15.255 --> 35:19.601
somewhere around, oh, 110 to 115. Now, I

35:19.661 --> 35:28.654
left the company the next day to go on R&R. Now, that 
hurt.

35:32.720 --> 35:37.426
I came back a week later and was the battalion 
intelligence officer. I had the same unit. But

35:40.731 --> 35:42.113
that was not a good time to leave.

35:48.809 --> 35:57.022
When you returned to the state, before I go on, how 
did you feel about the policy that was being used?

35:57.183 --> 36:07.079
When I first went to Vietnam,

35:57.183 --> 36:07.079
we were there to protect

35:57.183 --> 36:07.079
the Vietnamese government from being overrun. 
And early on in the stage, the Vietnamese

36:07.800 --> 36:13.990
government was losing about two battalions a 
month. you could sit down there and

36:14.257 --> 36:21.204
mathematically count on basically how long the 
government was going to last on a logarithmic

36:14.257 --> 36:21.204
curve.

36:24.527 --> 36:31.494
We pretty much turned the war around in terms of 
defeating the guerrilla forces. That doesn't

36:33.176 --> 36:39.842
mean we found all of them, but we had stopped the 
horrendous losses that the Arvin army was taking.

36:43.096 --> 36:52.188
Then they brought in the NVA, where they could come 
down out the borders, come in, raid, make

36:43.096 --> 36:52.188
assaults, move back across the borders.

36:55.052 --> 37:11.533
I suppose the situation was very similar to some of 
the problems that they had in Korea, but it didn't

36:55.052 --> 37:11.533
take a tactical genius to figure out that if they 
had a line that they could cross where we couldn't

36:55.052 --> 37:11.533
follow them, we couldn't win. I maintained, as a 
young captain, not being privy to all of the

37:12.880 --> 37:26.433
problems that the government was looking at, that 
we should have mobilized the country as a whole.

37:26.774 --> 37:30.437
Number one, to ensure that the country was 
together. And two, we should have taken the war to

37:30.477 --> 37:37.845
Vietnam, or North Vietnam. And three, there 
should have been no safe areas. If they go in there,

37:41.973 --> 37:43.815
we go after them. I found once

37:44.917 --> 37:53.688
an American POW camp in Cambodia that they would 
not let me go after. I had gone into Cambodia after

37:53.929 --> 38:11.271
being, after chasing some guys up to the river, and 
I left my company and took three volunteers with

37:53.929 --> 38:11.271
me, which I got chewed out for later, and went 
across the river and found an American, a very

37:53.929 --> 38:11.271
small one, but an American POW and they would not 
let me go get it because it was in Cambodia and it was

38:12.297 --> 38:16.283
off limits. Six months later, when Nixon 
authorized American troops to go into Cambodia,

38:17.525 --> 38:24.937
that Pildokia camp had been moved.

38:27.842 --> 38:29.465
And I couldn't bust it with three guys. Do you feel 
bitter about the way the government did it? I don't

38:37.397 --> 38:38.780
know whether bitter is the right word. I think that 
before we get involved in any more conflicts, that

38:40.428 --> 38:47.919
we need to make a hard, cold decision whether we 
want to win.

38:51.385 --> 38:55.471
And if so, we need to take the appropriate steps to 
do that. If not, stay the hell out of it. We

38:58.155 --> 39:01.640
basically lost 55,000 guys for nothing. Do you 
feel the war was winnable?

39:07.689 --> 39:08.190
I don't know. I think we had a better shot at it than 
we did if they had turned us loose.

39:19.415 --> 39:33.598
The problem is that we were trying to hold up a 
government that was corrupt, inept,

39:19.415 --> 39:33.598
and doomed to failure. The war was probably 
winnable, but I think it was only winnable if we

39:37.718 --> 39:44.788
took over the government and rebuilt it much like 
we did in Japan after the Second World War. To prop

39:45.649 --> 39:54.982
up the government as it existed was doomed to 
failure because it did not have the popular

39:45.649 --> 39:54.982
support of the people. The Communists did not have 
the popular support of the people either in terms

39:56.324 --> 40:02.072
of percentages.

40:05.815 --> 40:08.879
Most of the people just wanted to be left alone. The 
government would come in in the daylight and take

40:08.900 --> 40:17.632
their number one son and half their rice, and the 
NVA would come in at night, take the number two son

40:08.900 --> 40:17.632
and the other half of the rice. The poor guys were 
left in the middle.

40:23.541 --> 40:27.306
But Vietnam damn near destroyed American 
service. It took us eight to ten years to put the

40:29.129 --> 40:34.557
Army back together. The officer corps at the end of 
75 was bitter, disillusioned.

40:44.286 --> 40:54.598
There was a widespread movement for a while 
amongst the troops to unionize, which had some

40:44.286 --> 40:54.598
support from the general officer corps. It was not 
a fun time. Most of the troops felt betrayed.

41:06.008 --> 41:19.807
And it was probably not until the late 70s, early 
80s

41:06.008 --> 41:19.807
that we finally got the NCO Corps and the officer 
corps put back together.

41:22.712 --> 41:35.830
One of the problems we had from, oh, 68 on was that 
the Army had expanded so fast that we didn't have

41:22.712 --> 41:35.830
the NCO Corps.

41:38.678 --> 41:47.588
We made, at least in the Army, I don't know what the 
Marines did, what they called jokingly as the

41:38.678 --> 41:47.588
Shake and Bake MCO Academy. And basically they ran 
an OCS for NCOs. They would send them down to Fort

41:52.453 --> 41:58.400
Benning, and we would turn out either E-5s or E-6s 
in eight weeks. You'd take a kid who did well on his

41:59.541 --> 42:07.150
basic qualifying scores, on his initial entrance 
examinations into the military, And he did fairly

42:07.805 --> 42:11.391
well in basic and AIT. They would send him to Fort 
Benning, running through the NCO Academy, and he

42:11.511 --> 42:23.269
would come out as an E-5 in the top, I think, 5% or 6% 
got to be E-6s.

42:25.633 --> 42:31.382
For what they had to do and the training they had, 
they did an outstanding job. but they still didn't

42:32.138 --> 42:40.807
have the 10 years of experience in dealing with 
people that we expected from most of our NCOs. On

42:40.827 --> 42:47.294
several occasions as a company commander in 
Vietnam, I had E-4s run in platoons.

42:50.138 --> 42:55.303
Considering what we had to work with, they did an 
outstanding job. I know of no other army in the

42:56.364 --> 43:01.690
world that you can decimate your nco ranks and end 
up with corporals and e4s and e5s taking over e7's

43:02.311 --> 43:27.053
jobs

43:02.311 --> 43:27.053
what do you feel about what's more

43:02.311 --> 43:27.053
while i was at the commander general staff college 
at fort leavenworth

43:30.610 --> 43:35.997
We had a number of general officers come to speak.

43:36.017 --> 43:42.044
Most of these were required attendants, although 
most of us were probably gone anyway.

43:44.487 --> 43:53.137
Westmoreland, after he had retired, showed up as a 
visiting guest speaker, not required

43:44.487 --> 43:53.137
attendance, basically hawking his book.

43:57.242 --> 43:59.605
It was scheduled after class hours. at four 
o'clock in the afternoon, and of the 800 odd majors

44:00.023 --> 44:13.944
and lieutenant colonels in that class, about 150 
of us showed up.

44:13.964 --> 44:26.183
Leavenworth is unique in that, that and the War 
College, there is a policy that when you get

44:13.964 --> 44:26.183
visiting officers in, there is no such thing as 
rank. You can ask any question. It cannot be done in

44:30.165 --> 44:36.690
an impolite manner, but what is said in those 
rooms, stay in those rooms.

44:40.133 --> 44:45.758
Westmoreland went on about his book and why he 
thought that some of our political decisions were

44:40.133 --> 44:45.758
incorrect. And a young major who had, and all of us 
had served under Westmoreland,

44:46.979 --> 44:56.507
asked him if he was so opposed to the what was going 
on over there. Why did he not resign in protest to

44:58.005 --> 45:02.390
make a statement? And his answer was, well, he 
thought he could do better staying there. At which

45:08.117 --> 45:14.284
time, better than half of the 150 of us got up and 
walked out.

45:17.949 --> 45:19.471
I'm not sure that answers your question.

45:23.616 --> 45:24.857
When you left Vietnam, When you came back and you 
became a student with the Army, tell me where you

45:25.748 --> 45:33.459
went and your experiences there. Well, you know 
that I was enlisted before I got commissioned. I

45:40.570 --> 45:43.855
became well aware of that in my second tour. If I 
wanted to stay in the service, a degree was an

45:45.497 --> 45:49.804
absolute requirement. And I wrote a letter back to 
the Department of the Army stating at the end of my

45:49.824 --> 45:55.452
tour in Vietnam, I was eligible to get out of the 
army or if I extended I was eligible for

45:55.634 --> 46:25.523
reassignment and I basically told them that at the 
end of that tour I was going back to school if I had to

45:55.634 --> 46:25.523
go back as a civilian I would and then I would come 
back in later but I would like to apply for what was

45:55.634 --> 46:25.523
called the bootstrap program at that point in time 
or the pilot program for the bootstrap

45:55.634 --> 46:25.523
I didn't hear anything I didn't hear anything I 
didn't hear anything I told you about the day that I

46:27.646 --> 46:40.318
was due to go on R&R, and

46:27.646 --> 46:40.318
after having lost these 52 guys, I'm sitting in a 
hole. I've got water up to my knees. My morale was, I

46:42.480 --> 46:47.264
feel like I have, I've really done something bad. 
At this point in time, I don't know that I've run

46:47.284 --> 46:51.609
into a regiment that I didn't have a chance. I think 
I really screwed up and cost a whole bunch of people

46:51.709 --> 46:56.353
their lives.

47:00.299 --> 47:15.713
the mail bird comes in and I get a letter from Jerry 
and some correspondence from Axel and a long

47:00.299 --> 47:15.713
letter from the Department of Army basically 
stating that if I want to I can go back to college.

47:20.897 --> 47:28.804
At the end of that tour I went back to Adams State 
College in Colorado which is a small teaching

47:20.897 --> 47:28.804
college that has a pretty decent business 
department. And I went to that one because they

47:33.611 --> 47:41.180
were the first one that sent me back a letter 
saying, yeah, we'll accept you and you can

47:33.611 --> 47:41.180
complete your four years of school in less than 24 
months.

47:44.484 --> 47:50.792
I wore civilian clothes most of the time, but this 
was 69 and 70 in the days of...
