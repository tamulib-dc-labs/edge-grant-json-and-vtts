WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:02.625
very much opposed to. I'm opposed to public policy 
trying to direct research towards specific

00:03.085 --> 00:09.192
relevant goals. Not because the goals aren't 
worthy, but because I think that we're not smart

00:09.973 --> 00:16.120
enough to know how to do that properly. I'm quite a 
fan of basic research, which then when you then

00:16.140 --> 00:31.118
look at and find out what results from basic 
research can be turned into focused strategic

00:16.140 --> 00:31.118
results at a later date. I think a good example, 
just a personal anecdote from people I've known,

00:31.823 --> 00:42.318
Ron Prinn at MIT was a student when I was there 
working with John Lewis. And he worked on the

00:43.239 --> 00:47.145
photochemistry of the Jupiter atmosphere. And he 
was tremendously excited, as we all were, about

00:47.525 --> 00:56.498
the things emerging, about the new knowledge of 
the chemistry of the solar nebula and the

00:47.525 --> 00:56.498
atmosphere of the planets. And Ron has since 
become one of the leaders in the details of the

00:56.478 --> 01:11.989
photochemistry of the Earth's atmosphere as 
well, including the destruction of ozone and the

00:56.478 --> 01:11.989
chemistry in the atmosphere leading to those 
types of things. You could never have started out a

01:12.425 --> 01:24.119
program in your wildest dreams that said, I want 
somebody to go study the chemistry of Jupiter's

01:12.425 --> 01:24.119
clouds in order to solve the ozone layer problem. 
That is not the way science works. And

01:26.622 --> 01:35.812
unfortunately, a lot of the people

01:26.622 --> 01:35.812
in Washington are just totally misguided in this 
sense, mostly because of background. They're

01:35.832 --> 01:36.794
mostly lawyers. That is not the way you set up a 
scientific program to develop the things you need

01:36.854 --> 01:42.280
for public policy. And I think as scientists it's 
our duty to, even though it's nice to sell a program

01:42.648 --> 02:01.213
and try to get lots of bucks for particular 
relevancy, to try to step back a little bit and

01:42.648 --> 02:01.213
educate and provide good advice to the government 
that we need the broad-based research in order to

02:01.514 --> 02:06.018
have the successful focused research. A lot's 
been made of our, this is an area that I'm not

02:06.098 --> 02:21.252
personally connected with, but a lot's been made 
of our interactions with the Japanese over the

02:06.098 --> 02:21.252
years and the fact that they have exploited a lot of 
microchip technology and things like that. A lot

02:21.272 --> 02:25.275
of that basic research, if you go back, I believe 
you will find was done here. And it wasn't that

02:25.335 --> 02:29.880
anybody wasn't focused properly here. It's that 
the people didn't take and develop the industrial

02:31.501 --> 02:40.709
government relationships to use that basic 
science for economic ends as well here as they did

02:31.501 --> 02:40.709
in Japan. I think if you started off trying to find 
the next thing in that area and focus all of your

02:41.230 --> 02:51.599
research on that, you're probably missing what 
will really be the big payoff because you don't

02:41.230 --> 02:51.599
know what it is. It's out there someplace in basic 
research.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.968
Here's the penultimate question, and it's wildly 
different. At the beginning of this century,

03:01.657 --> 03:07.323
planetary astronomy was a respected part, a large 
part of the general field of astronomy. People

03:07.903 --> 03:12.348
like Henry Norris Russell wrote papers on the 
upper atmosphere and clouds of Venus. By the end of

03:13.789 --> 03:17.573
World War II, it was essentially dead. Who killed 
planetary astronomy? Well, that was before my

03:21.557 --> 03:24.400
time, of course. It's before everybody's time, so 
I have to ask. My, well, you might find a few still.

03:32.258 --> 03:33.740
Gee, isn't, what's his name? Vanderholtz is still 
around, isn't he? Yeah. I guess my perspective on

03:40.307 --> 03:49.197
that, and it comes from what study I've done of the 
history of science, is that my guess is that

03:40.307 --> 03:49.197
Percival Lowell killed it off. Gerard de 
Bacalure, that was... That was what he said, just

03:53.817 --> 03:55.339
two words. And then there's also the comment that, 
really, when you think about it, there wasn't much

03:55.900 --> 04:05.191
people could do with the photographic plates that 
they had to take spectra. Photometry was no good.

04:06.392 --> 04:11.459
And they kind of ran up against a brick wall in 
learning anything physically about the planets.

04:16.445 --> 04:16.585
Yeah. I also think perhaps dead is not as, if you 
look at the overall field of planetary science as

04:16.970 --> 04:29.211
opposed to specifically going to the telescope 
and making physical observations of the planets,

04:16.970 --> 04:29.211
it was not that dead. There was still celestial 
mechanics going on and research into orbital

04:29.231 --> 04:36.143
theory and things of that sort. In fact, going into 
the early ages, parts of the space age, if you look

04:36.123 --> 04:43.831
at kind of a broader base thing. But specifically 
with respect to telescopic work that our brother

04:43.871 --> 05:04.932
astronomers would regard as astronomy, I think 
that the taint of getting involved with the types

04:43.871 --> 05:04.932
of

04:43.871 --> 05:04.932
social images that became associated with 
Percival Lowell and the little green men on Mars

04:43.871 --> 05:04.932
and canals and so forth drove off a lot of people. 
And I think your point about technology is an

05:04.912 --> 05:08.617
important one. I think that in addition to a few key 
individuals like Gerard Kuiper getting involved

05:08.718 --> 05:22.498
in planetary astronomy, the resurgence of 
planetary astronomy had a lot to do with

05:08.718 --> 05:22.498
technology. that evolved past the photographic 
plate, past World War II particularly,

05:22.478 --> 05:35.540
photoelectric and infrared sensors and the rest 
of the electronic revolution basically. We've

05:36.882 --> 05:46.258
seen the recent demise of the Galileo, I mean of the 
Mars Observer space probe as it attempted to enter

05:36.882 --> 05:46.258
orbit around Mars. There's also an Air Force probe 
called Clementine, which is supposed to do all

05:47.150 --> 05:55.044
sorts of things that are a ridiculously small 
amount of money. And I have heard that there is some

05:56.607 --> 06:07.806
thought being given to abolishing NASA, making it 
the National Aeronautics Administration, and

05:56.607 --> 06:07.806
letting the Air Force do the stuff. Would you work 
for the Air Force under those circumstances? I'd

06:13.154 --> 06:18.623
continue to try to do my science, depending on who 
was funding it. I had a lot of colleagues in the

06:19.164 --> 06:38.638
early days that had a very successful 
relationship with the Office of Naval Research,

06:19.164 --> 06:38.638
which had a history of funding very fundamental 
research into communications theory, radar, and

06:19.164 --> 06:38.638
radio propagation, for instance, from which they 
derived a lot of practical benefits, but they put

06:19.164 --> 06:38.638
few constraints on it in those days. I think that 
could work. You could imagine, I guess the problem

06:40.623 --> 06:47.916
is you can imagine any number of ways in which 
public policy and funding could be conducted. If

06:48.817 --> 06:53.826
you want my opinion about NASA with all of its 
faults now versus trying to turn over these things

06:54.228 --> 07:01.205
to the remains of the Star Wars program in the Air 
Force, I'd say nuts. I think that wouldn't work at

07:01.285 --> 07:02.548
all. You talk about Clementine being cheap. All 
that's cheap is this particular piece of hardware

07:05.395 --> 07:12.051
that one is trying to deal with. The investment to 
produce that thing, whatever it is, was huge. That

07:17.204 --> 07:23.110
investment isn't there on that side of the 
government either at the moment for future

07:17.204 --> 07:23.110
things. That's going to be tough to prove that to 
Congress. They're just going to look at the bottom

07:25.773 --> 07:27.094
line. The reason I mention that is that before 
there wasn't an NSA, the Air Force poured an

07:27.855 --> 07:32.980
enormous amount of money into stuff. Kuiper's big 
four volumes, that was Air Force funded. My

07:36.644 --> 07:40.688
graduate studies were all funded by the Air Force. 
They gave a lot of money to places like McDonnell

07:41.242 --> 07:51.397
Douglas and Louise Young worked there under Gil 
Ploss, and there were a lot of infrared spots for

07:41.242 --> 07:51.397
John Strong, and Bill Sinton got a lot of Air Force 
money. And the Air Force was ready, willing, and

07:52.219 --> 07:55.123
able to just keep going. They didn't want an NASA. 
You know what? NACA, keep doing what it's doing,

07:57.006 --> 08:00.972
and we'll take care of space. I was fundamentally a 
policy decision made by the Eisenhower

08:01.407 --> 08:08.997
administration to make civilian space as our 
response to Sputnik. And I think it's served the

08:09.017 --> 08:10.979
country well. It's not to say that one couldn't 
imagine another structure or even that another

08:11.780 --> 08:21.253
structure might not be desirable now. But at the 
moment... I think one of the keys to what you just

08:24.205 --> 08:44.340
said is bucks, and I think that the parts of the DOD 
that would like to get involved in this at the

08:24.205 --> 08:44.340
moment are doing so not because there's big bucks 
there, but because they're desperately trying to

08:24.205 --> 08:44.340
find a reason for existence for some of the parts 
that have wound down as a result of the Cold War

08:24.205 --> 08:44.340
going away.

08:47.982 --> 09:03.567
What we ought to do is schedule another session for 
the whole horrid story of the

08:47.982 --> 09:03.567
great Saturn's rings affair with Kuiper and 
Crookshank and the MIT crew. But I would just say,

09:04.148 --> 09:12.522
since I was talking about ion volcanism, I thought 
I might just share with you a little bit of my

09:04.148 --> 09:12.522
perspective personal history in terms of the time 
that Voyager actually discovered the volcanic,

09:12.755 --> 09:40.021
volcanically driven plumes on Io, if you will, 
because I don't think it's generally appreciated

09:12.755 --> 09:40.021
that we, in effect, did ourselves in in a very 
clever way and prevented the discovery of the

09:12.755 --> 09:40.021
plumes on Io in real time. And To understand this 
requires a little bit of knowledge about the way

09:42.185 --> 09:50.096
the real-time imaging systems worked at JPL. The 
images come in to the DSN and then went over to the,

09:50.176 --> 09:59.008
at that time, the image processing laboratory for 
more detailed work. That's where all the computer

09:59.048 --> 10:07.399
magic, if you will, ended up getting produced on 
the pictures, put on disks so we could observe them

09:59.048 --> 10:07.399
on monitors and so forth. with the usual 
stretches. People are used to the concept of

10:09.829 --> 10:16.154
stretches and so forth, and in essence 
re-exposing the images and looking at different

10:09.829 --> 10:16.154
intensity levels. During the Voyager mission at 
Jupiter, for the first time, we had the option of

10:18.776 --> 10:37.993
putting in a little bit of image processing up 
front right after the data came in from the DSN so

10:18.776 --> 10:37.993
that we could display in real time on monitors 
around the laboratory processed images, not raw

10:18.776 --> 10:37.993
images. And for Io in particular, and the 
satellites, we couldn't guarantee that all the

10:38.581 --> 10:47.912
exposures would be just right to come out. In other 
words, if we had put up raw images, they would have

10:47.972 --> 10:52.998
looked all right, but they would have looked 
washed out. At Jupiter, too. So we developed a

10:55.181 --> 11:02.249
number of these real-time algorithms that we 
could put in there so the images on the TV tubes

10:55.181 --> 11:02.249
would look nice to people as they were coming in. 
The nature of these algorithms were to take the

11:03.010 --> 11:05.753
faintest few percent of the image and the 
brightest few percent of the image and throw it

11:06.560 --> 11:22.223
away and and expand the contrast of what remained 
called an auto ends in stretch because you only

11:06.560 --> 11:22.223
have so much available and if you want to expand the 
middle range you've got to get rid of the extreme

11:22.270 --> 11:24.094
Now, of course, we weren't actually throwing away 
in the data. That was going onto tapes and going on

11:24.154 --> 11:27.220
in for later analysis. But if you think about what 
an auto ends in stretch, i.e., throwing away the

11:27.782 --> 11:40.448
bottom few percent of intensity levels and 
stretching the picture does for Io, it is the best

11:27.782 --> 11:40.448
anti-volcanic plume filter you could possibly 
imagine. The plumes are not very bright. The

11:42.090 --> 11:43.893
plumes were not very bright. So as a result of that, 
it turned out that the plumes were crashingly easy

11:44.434 --> 11:54.709
to observe in raw images, even though the surface 
of Io wouldn't have been well exposed in those

11:44.434 --> 11:54.709
cases. So in effect, by making the real-time 
pictures more accessible to the public, making

11:58.568 --> 12:09.969
them look better on the monitors, we denied all of 
us the real-time discovery of the plumes. It's

12:09.989 --> 12:10.910
sort of ironic. The press room would have been, you 
know, it would have had the guy from the New York

12:10.950 --> 12:20.167
Times and Jonathan Eberhardt and people like that 
would have been the discoverers of the plumes.

12:20.187 --> 12:21.169
They would have seen them first. They were very 
easy to find. And it was interesting. The way they

12:25.808 --> 12:31.921
were actually found, as you probably know, was by 
an optical navigation engineer looking at a

12:25.808 --> 12:31.921
highly stretched picture. And the reason we 
hadn't looked at any raw pictures by that time was

12:32.643 --> 12:37.754
everybody was exhausted after the Jupiter 
encounter. Everybody went to bed and slept for 48

12:37.774 --> 12:41.181
hours immediately afterwards. And we came back 
in, I think it was the following Monday morning,

12:41.161 --> 12:58.064
I've forgotten the exact time sequence, and we 
started, our duty on the imaging team was, okay,

12:41.161 --> 12:58.064
now let's look at each picture, make sure we know 
what's in it, and we can kind of, you know, catalog

12:41.161 --> 12:58.064
what's there so we can start the analysis process. 
So Joe Verwerk and several of us sat down at one of

12:58.084 --> 13:02.950
the terminals and started going through the 
pictures. we'd heard kind of whisperings around

13:02.930 --> 13:26.794
the uh around the hallways that something funny 
was there and brad wouldn't tell us what it was what

13:02.930 --> 13:26.794
had happened was linda had linda marvita had found 
this thing on this highly stretched overexposed

13:02.930 --> 13:26.794
image of the taken for optical navigation 
purposes and she'd finally taken that to brad and

13:02.930 --> 13:26.794
said look you know something funny here we can't 
explain and he'd figured out it was probably a

13:02.930 --> 13:26.794
volcanic We were looking for volcanic effects at 
that time as a result of Peale et al.' 's prediction

13:33.085 --> 13:35.667
of volcanic effects on Io. It came out just before, 
and also because of the way the surface looked. But

13:39.972 --> 13:43.175
nobody at that point had imagined we might 
actually see active volcanism. In fact, there was

13:45.237 --> 13:56.308
a predilection not to jump in that direction 
because the Mars people with Viking orbiter had

13:45.237 --> 13:56.308
been skunked several times by people making false 
claims to having seen active volcanism. So at any

13:57.942 --> 14:00.807
rate, we kind of knew something was up.

14:04.213 --> 14:09.944
We knew something was up, and there were people 
scurrying around, and Brad had his door closed and

14:04.213 --> 14:09.944
so forth. So I said, let's sit down and take a look at 
the pictures. So we started going through the raw

14:12.548 --> 14:16.395
pictures with Joe sitting there. I'd forgotten 
who else was standing around. And Joe pulled up a

14:19.492 --> 14:30.215
picture, which I think probably turned out to be 
what we now call Prometheus, with this little

14:19.492 --> 14:30.215
mushroom sticking out the side of the planet. And 
Joe looked at it and says, hey, what the hell is

14:30.796 --> 14:33.642
this? And we all looked at it and said, it must be a 
volcano going off by a dam. Brad walked out about

14:37.565 --> 14:42.894
that time, and we pulled him over and said, Brad, is 
this what we're not supposed to know about or talk

14:37.565 --> 14:42.894
about? He looked at it and says, get that off the 
screen. Because these things, of course, could be

14:45.879 --> 14:48.423
seen in other places. Then he looked at it and says, 
what? That's another one. So the rest of the day was

14:52.389 --> 14:56.957
spent hunting plumes and cataloging all the 
plumes. But in retrospect, it's really ironic

14:57.241 --> 15:12.003
that by applying our neat image processing 
techniques early on, we delayed that discovery by

14:57.241 --> 15:12.003
about a week, as it turned out, in terms of when the 
data showed up. Although I don't know whether or

15:12.023 --> 15:17.571
not I would have been awake to actually try to do 
anything with them if we discovered them during

15:12.023 --> 15:17.571
the encounter. You mentioned the affair of 
Saturn's rings. I've already interviewed Dale

15:20.696 --> 15:23.680
Cruikshank, and he was rather short on that. Could 
you kind of add a few personal notes on that? Well,

15:26.789 --> 15:39.205
that was when I was a postdoc at MIT, and the offices 
in the lab right around where I was, Clark Chapman

15:26.789 --> 15:39.205
and Carl Pilcher were both working. Carl was 
getting geared up to do infrared Fourier

15:39.645 --> 15:55.345
transform spectroscopy on satellites and rings, 
and ultimately was one of the people that was

15:39.645 --> 15:55.345
involved in the final pegging down of the 
identification of water ice on the Galilean

15:39.645 --> 15:55.345
satellites. But what occurred at the time of the 
Saturn's ring spectra was that there was a Sky and

15:56.624 --> 16:06.501
Telescope article published with a very recent 
spectrum that Dale had taken, I believe. I've

16:06.561 --> 16:07.863
forgotten with what instrument. Compared with a 
solar-type star spectrum in the usual classical

16:09.526 --> 16:14.915
astronomical way. And they differed. And the 
place of maximum difference was a wavelength that

16:16.958 --> 16:22.648
looked like it might be associated with an ammonia 
absorption. And so there was this Sky and

16:23.320 --> 16:36.496
Telescope article, which in effect was the first 
publication of the spectrum, which is a little bit

16:23.320 --> 16:36.496
irregular anyway, which identified this as 
ammonia absorptions in Saturn's rings. That's

16:36.797 --> 16:39.304
what it was. What happened, I think, probably was 
motivated by Carl's beginning his thesis work on

16:40.077 --> 16:48.911
worrying about a similar type spectra for the 
Galilean satellites. They looked at this stuff

16:49.532 --> 16:52.697
and they said, well, I can't really make heads or 
tails out of this. We've got to back up. This isn't a

16:57.545 --> 16:59.669
ratio spectra. What they were doing was actually 
comparing the little wiggly spectra, looking for

16:59.689 --> 17:04.977
the maximum difference. Now, if you think about 
it, the difference is not what you want. A lot of

17:08.360 --> 17:15.449
astronomers get used to dealing with differences 
as the right quantity, because if you look at

17:08.360 --> 17:15.449
differences in magnitude, it's a ratio of 
intensities. Only these were intensities, and

17:16.451 --> 17:20.116
they were looking at the point of maximum 
difference. What Clark and Carl did was took and

17:21.137 --> 17:29.488
Xeroxed the spectrum up and digitized it. I've 
forgotten exactly how, and took a ratio. The ratio

17:32.352 --> 17:34.114
spectrum showed dips in a different place than the 
different spectrum did, if you will. And they

17:38.518 --> 17:40.681
looked at that and said, that doesn't look like 
ammonia. And they dug out some recent work at that

17:41.182 --> 17:46.770
time by Hugh Keefer, who had measured the spectrum 
of various ices. And he says, that's just water. It

17:48.773 --> 17:50.896
looks just like Keefer's water spectrum. Now, 
what happened after that, I was kind of an outside

17:52.799 --> 17:58.347
observer on all of this, if you will. That was my 
position as well. I knew everybody involved, but I

18:02.377 --> 18:10.333
And, you know, Carl and Clark sort of asked my 
opinion about what sorts of things ought to be

18:02.377 --> 18:10.333
done. Clark was a close friend of Dale 
Kirkshank's. And my memory is what happened was he

18:13.239 --> 18:18.709
called up Dale and said, Hey, Dale, you know, that 
ain't ammonia, it's water. And he explained it,

18:18.729 --> 18:22.056
and Dale says, By God, you're right, you know, or 
something similar. And so then they went into one

18:22.525 --> 18:28.070
of the first DPS meetings was coming up right after 
that. And they went into a big soul searching about

18:28.090 --> 18:35.738
what ought to be done in these cases. 
Interestingly enough, there was a classic case of

18:36.378 --> 18:42.164
the sentient bands on Mars where a similar thing 
had happened. And what ended up happening in that

18:42.224 --> 18:50.592
case was all of the various parties got together 
and published a paper with the correct

18:42.224 --> 18:50.592
interpretation, basically. Well, there were 
also a few fiascos, like taking some of the Mariner

18:50.707 --> 18:57.882
spacecraft and finding hydrochloric acid and 
hydrochloric acid on Mars. Yes. Before my time.

19:00.267 --> 19:03.594
And what is it, helium on where? Venus or Mars or 
something like that. Yeah. So at any rate, what I

19:09.067 --> 19:16.995
remember happening was that Clark called up Dale, 
and what he suggested was a collaboration. He

19:17.015 --> 19:19.157
says, look, you know, we didn't take these data. 
This is your data, Dale, you know. But I think this

19:22.440 --> 19:26.725
is the right interpretation, and, you know, we'd 
like to get some credit for it. So they, in essence,

19:27.966 --> 19:33.492
proposed a collaborative paper with taking the 
specter and laying it out. And this is hearsay

19:34.352 --> 19:38.837
evidence now is that Dale took this proposal took 
this proposal to Kuiper and got a rather emphatic

19:38.817 --> 19:45.226
no back on it. Kuiper's position was apparently 
something along the lines of his laboratory had a

19:46.028 --> 19:59.828
program in this area and they would have stumbled 
onto this very shortly anyway, and these

19:46.028 --> 19:59.828
interlopers from MIT could go, you know, fly a 
kite. If it's not a true story, it should have been

19:59.848 --> 20:03.854
because it's quite characteristic. Quite 
characteristic. At any rate, what I do know has

20:05.513 --> 20:15.237
happened is Dale ultimately came back to Dale, to 
Clark and Carl, and said, you know, you're right,

20:05.513 --> 20:15.237
but I... but I can't be a co-author with you on the 
paper. Kuiper nixed that. And so the end result was

20:23.415 --> 20:45.595
that the paper that actually correctly 
identified water ice as a major constituent of the

20:23.415 --> 20:45.595
rings of Saturn based on Dale Kirkshank's 
spectrum never had Kirkshank's name on it, which

20:23.415 --> 20:45.595
is a shame in terms of the history of science, 
although they gave every possible

20:23.415 --> 20:45.595
acknowledgement to where the spectrum came from 
and referenced the Sky and Telescope article.

20:45.575 --> 20:56.308
It's an example of, I think, some of the negative 
aspects of the kind of autocratic way in which some

20:45.575 --> 20:56.308
of the old-time planetary astronomers ran their 
lab. There's very little flexibility in some

20:56.348 --> 21:04.839
cases, and it wasn't many years after that that 
Dale left LPL for a very successful career out in

20:56.348 --> 21:04.839
Hawaii. Well, of course, in those early days, 
people like Kuiper They were acting in the

21:08.643 --> 21:13.308
condition of the old-time observatory heads who 
were God Almighty. Dr. Professor, there is only

21:14.028 --> 21:18.693
one professor in the department. Well, I never had 
the guts to call him Gerard. Fred Whipple is the

21:21.676 --> 21:23.417
only person I know. Well, I'll tell you, I didn't 
have that type of relationship with Quaper

21:23.678 --> 21:34.228
either, but Bruce Murray got him on my thesis 
committee. I should say, I've forgotten exactly

21:34.512 --> 21:38.758
what they called it at JPL. When we defended our 
dissertation, there was a committee that usually

21:38.778 --> 21:45.467
tried to involve a few outside scientists. And 
since my thesis was on the Galilean satellites,

21:45.727 --> 21:55.020
Bruce Dragoon and Kuiper into sitting on my 
committee. Now, Caltech, these things were not

21:55.040 --> 22:01.088
the Spanish Inquisition type of things that they 
are in some departments. That came earlier in the

22:01.388 --> 22:04.232
orals. If you passed your orals and put together a 
respectable dissertation, they didn't let you

22:04.212 --> 22:14.162
defend your dissertation unless it was ready to 
go. So these things were generally relatively

22:15.203 --> 22:19.347
gentlemanly type affairs. But Jim Westfall was 
another member of my committee. And during the

22:24.893 --> 22:31.840
course of my discussion, he started baiting me 
about the issue of the sizes of the satellites and

22:24.893 --> 22:31.840
what their albedos were. At this time, there were 
no really accurate measurements of the diameters

22:32.461 --> 22:37.911
of the satellites. They're all about one arc 
second to one and a half arc seconds in size, as seen

22:37.931 --> 22:53.862
from the Earth, and notoriously hard to measure, 
going back to early measurements using a stellar

22:37.931 --> 22:53.862
interferometer by Michelson himself, who didn't 
get the right answer, by the way, for reasons I

22:37.931 --> 22:53.862
still don't understand. But Kuiper had made quite 
a deal for some years right around that time of

22:54.432 --> 23:22.144
making these very, very accurate, he claimed 
very, very precise discometer measurements,

22:54.432 --> 23:22.144
comparing discs under similar illumination in an 
eyepiece with what he was seeing under very good

22:54.432 --> 23:22.144
conditions, and was making what a lot of the more 
physical astronomers regarded as somewhat

22:54.432 --> 23:22.144
exaggerated claims to the precision with which he 
could measure diameters this way. You tried that

23:22.529 --> 23:24.572
with Pluto, too, as well. Yes, all the small 
objects. And, you know, I mean, it was a valiant

23:25.854 --> 23:27.436
effort. It was one way to attack the problem. But it 
was regarded as highly unphysical by the Caltech

23:29.319 --> 23:32.623
types. And I had very carefully hedged my bets in my 
dissertation on this by plotting everything that

23:33.104 --> 23:45.021
had diameter in it with a full range of errors in all 
diameter measurements. Albedos and densities

23:45.442 --> 23:47.845
and so forth were big errors. big blobs with error 
bars and all of my stuff, because I didn't want to

23:47.825 --> 23:54.817
touch the issue of what was the right numbers, 
because I knew we didn't have them. But Westfall

23:55.539 --> 24:02.150
began baiting me a bit, trying to get me to say that 
Kuiper's numbers were all hogwash. And I said,

24:02.190 --> 24:05.296
well, you know, what numbers did you use here? How 
do you possibly measure something to that

24:05.336 --> 24:08.000
accuracy? And I continued to dance around this 
with Gerard sitting there. for the innocent

24:11.787 --> 24:15.751
bystander when the cops shoot him out with the bank 
robbers. And I have something very pleasant to say

24:16.031 --> 24:19.534
about Kuiper as a result. About midway through 
this, and Westfall, as you know, can get very

24:19.574 --> 24:24.599
aggressive on these types of things. About midway 
through this little discussion, Kuiper sat back

24:24.639 --> 24:34.608
and said, well, those were my measurements, and 
they don't really affect the results of this

24:24.639 --> 24:34.608
gentleman's dissertation. Let's move on. So I 
have a debt to Gerard Kuiper on that score. This is

24:39.901 --> 24:42.083
war story time. You're talking about the 
attitudes of traditional astronomers. And my

24:45.507 --> 24:49.591
very first experience could have turned me off 
entirely on this whole thing. Very soon after I

24:50.132 --> 24:59.382
started thinking I was going to be doing 
observations for part of my thesis work, Bruce had

24:50.132 --> 24:59.382
some time scheduled on the 60-inch at Mount 
Wilson. And he said, you go up there with the

24:59.642 --> 25:01.444
equipment. Use it. I can't use it tonight. I'd 
never been up there in my life. So he told me how to

25:05.332 --> 25:13.336
get up there, how to get in the gate, how to get to the 
monastery, and when dinner was, and told me I'd

25:05.332 --> 25:13.336
better get up there in time for dinner. He didn't 
give me any background or any warning or anything.

25:17.330 --> 25:23.457
Both Palomar and Mount Wilson were still very 
tradition-bound back in 66, 67. And as it turned

25:25.199 --> 25:31.946
out, there was only one other observer on the 
mountain, Olin Egan, I believe, who was on the

25:25.199 --> 25:31.946
100-inch. And, of course, the 100-inch observer 
was the king. He sat at the end of the table and rang

25:34.409 --> 25:39.154
the little bell for getting the food and so forth. 
And here I was, this first-year graduate student

25:39.775 --> 25:46.122
trying to figure out what to do at the famous Mount 
Wilson Observatory, And here's this gruff old

25:46.237 --> 25:49.421
astronomer, Ola Negan, sitting up there. And this 
was in the midst of the Vietnam War, of course, and

25:49.461 --> 25:54.368
there was some stuff going on. I'd forgotten 
exactly what that was. They did have a TV up there.

25:57.692 --> 26:00.797
And I said, let's turn on the TV and find out what's 
happening with the news. And Ola Negan looked at me

26:00.857 --> 26:04.782
and he says, we make our own news up here. I said, 
yes, sir. That was my introduction to the

26:06.945 --> 26:11.451
traditional astronomers.

26:15.599 --> 26:16.300
So continue. Okay. The identification of the 
Vesta spectrum proceeded very rapidly because we

26:17.681 --> 26:32.956
had in hand at that time the preprint from McCord 
and Adams, which they just sent us up from where

26:17.681 --> 26:32.956
they were working on the Apollo samples, a couple 
of figures. And what they were doing was comparing

26:32.996 --> 26:37.300
various lunar spectra with various other things. 
And some of the things that had been proposed as

26:37.360 --> 26:42.585
having come from the moon or being like the moon, in 
fact, were the Eucritic meteorites. So there was a

26:44.268 --> 27:07.408
spectrum sitting in front of us of Nuevo Laredo and 
a whole bunch of lunar spectrum, and when Jay Elias

26:44.268 --> 27:07.408
brought in the plot of the data from the Vesta stuff 
from the previous month's run or whatever it was,

26:44.268 --> 27:07.408
it laid out with this huge absorption band in it, 
and I looked at it, and I looked at this preprint and

26:44.268 --> 27:07.408
figure that McCord had given me, and I said, by God, 
it's a basaltic achondrite. And I called up Tom and

27:07.777 --> 27:10.943
said, it's basaltic achondrite, Tom. You know, 
it's what it is. Then we proceeded to have a couple

27:12.787 --> 27:20.482
of weeks of very detailed work going back and forth 
as to whether we really thought it was a basaltic

27:12.787 --> 27:20.482
achondrite or not. It looks too obvious. It looked 
too obvious. And the other thing was that it turned

27:23.087 --> 27:30.561
out that there was another mineral that actually 
looked very similar to this, a pure mineral, is

27:23.087 --> 27:30.561
enstatite. that has an absorption feature that 
actually seemed to match a little closer. And Tom

27:34.713 --> 27:36.895
was going for, no, it's got to be Instatite. It 
can't really be this Eucrite-Pyroxene ratio type

27:36.915 --> 27:40.839
of thing. And it was John Lewis that finally got him 
off that after a little bit of acrimony. I don't

27:46.044 --> 27:47.805
know just how much. Lewis pointed out to him that, 
yes, Instatite had an absorption band there, but

27:48.566 --> 27:54.992
no meteoritic Instatite had any iron in it. The 
Instatite achondrites don't have any iron

27:55.052 --> 27:57.915
content. And so, yeah, you know, an enstatite with 
iron in it has a band in the right place, but that

27:57.895 --> 28:05.491
isn't what you get out in meteorites. So we ended up 
resolving it in favor of the, of Eucrites being the

28:06.012 --> 28:11.804
best match to the thing. But it was really the most 
obvious spectral identification that I've ever

28:15.412 --> 28:18.058
seen. It sat there and sitting there on the old Cal 
Comp plotter and comparing it with the Xerox of

28:18.078 --> 28:29.024
Tom's spectra, comparing lunar stuff to Nuevo 
Laredo, it was like a dry lab. Well, you should

28:30.688 --> 28:31.750
write a letter.
