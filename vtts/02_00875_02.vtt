WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:29.211
my direction and we have so far identified the 
processes how to do it when we were talking about

00:01.263 --> 00:29.211
doing this comprehensive planning process we 
also were wanting to have this whole process

00:01.263 --> 00:29.211
endorsed by the Planning Commission and by the 
City Council So we went through a long and tedious

00:29.883 --> 00:36.451
course of getting a resolution out of the city 
council. The city council has finally signed a

00:37.833 --> 00:57.898
resolution endorsing our process, but given us a 
mandate to produce a document, what we call

00:37.833 --> 00:57.898
planning policy manual, identifying why we're 
doing it, how we're doing it, with what kind of

00:58.233 --> 01:01.376
help, and it's a very detailed piece of document. 
This piece of document was sent to the Planning

01:02.097 --> 01:06.561
Commission for approval. And also in, I think 
January of 87, we've gotten the approval from the

01:07.561 --> 01:15.929
Planning Commission. So here's a copy for your 
review. I thank you. So the process now is that the

01:21.614 --> 01:26.839
Planning Department will do the

01:28.338 --> 01:29.279
sector plan. There will be about 23 sectors 
identified for areas inside the city limit,

01:29.379 --> 01:39.069
outside the city limit, into the ETJ. Really, in 
our sector division, the city limit is rather

01:39.970 --> 01:56.927
transparent because we feel like that really has 
not that much control over how development should

01:39.970 --> 01:56.927
happen.

01:57.245 --> 01:59.267
We sort of negated that. And also, Houston's taken 
a pretty forthright stand with regard to

01:59.287 --> 02:09.820
development in the ETJ, too, historically. Yes. 
Recently, we had a little bit more teeth. I think

02:13.325 --> 02:21.434
the last legislature provided us with plaque 
review power. Ephraim keeps saying that if any

02:22.616 --> 02:25.159
commissioner county judge that would locate a 
development outside of the city limit in there. In

02:33.464 --> 02:43.736
our ETJ, without the planning department's 
approval, we can bring lawsuits and it's really a

02:33.464 --> 02:43.736
misdemeanor offense according to the 
legislation. One thing I wanted to mention, Joe,

02:44.617 --> 02:51.805
was your neighborhood planning areas are the 
immediate in town areas surrounding the CBD.

02:56.220 --> 02:56.961
That's correct. That's usually the case when you 
talk about community development areas, mostly

02:56.981 --> 03:06.395
in the older neighborhoods surrounding the CBD, 
so to speak. However, we did identify the CBD

03:06.575 --> 03:12.944
itself as a part of the sector planning process. 
Part of the reason is there is not enough residents

03:13.465 --> 03:22.197
in that area to be included into the CD eligible 
situation. Who is in charge of the C.D. areas?

03:29.034 --> 03:32.579
Roberta Burroughs, another assistant director. 
Okay. I want to give her credit, too. Yes.

03:40.872 --> 03:51.407
Roberta, you know, you know Roberta, who is now the 
chapter, state chapter's, is she president or

03:40.872 --> 03:51.407
vice president or something? One of the officers. 
Well, one of the officers. And there you have your

03:54.589 --> 03:58.494
comprehensive planning process. Well, that's 
part of the summary that I was looking for just now

03:58.574 --> 04:02.599
for you. If you want to, we can read through it 
quickly, or you can go back and write it out from

04:03.239 --> 04:11.589
what I gave you later on. Well, we can get a summary, 
and then I can refer to that. So we are now in the

04:18.910 --> 04:29.405
process, as you see the other map, there's sector 
lines drawn and there's 23 sectors identified. We

04:29.906 --> 04:34.172
have also a report for sector boundary plan. 
Somewhere along the line, the question was raised

04:35.995 --> 04:47.652
that whether the department was arbitrarily 
drawing some lines to divide them up into sectors.

04:47.969 --> 05:02.379
and we have made a report and distributed it to the 
various groups for review and we did have some

04:47.969 --> 05:02.379
rather legitimate comments that would cause us to 
maybe change some of the sector lines. We do not

05:03.441 --> 05:07.750
want to divide neighborhoods and things like 
that. Well, when you say under your comprehensive

05:08.759 --> 05:22.671
planning documents that you're going to have 
neighborhood plans, sector plans, and summary

05:08.759 --> 05:22.671
plans, for example, what do you mean when you say 
neighborhood plans? What kind of plans? There

05:25.413 --> 05:28.276
will be elements there, won't there, of plans? 
Yes, neighborhood plans will be the plans that

05:28.696 --> 05:33.960
will be within the city area first. 
Location-wise, that is a specific item. Well,

05:37.103 --> 05:38.344
like what? For example, Fourth Ward. Okay, but 
what kind of, what will the plan show? The plans

05:43.860 --> 05:49.710
will show the redevelopment strategies, the 
existing conditions, and so on and so forth. It

05:49.730 --> 05:53.716
will be slightly different than the sector plan. 
The sector plan, like I said, will identify the

05:53.736 --> 06:01.969
infrastructure needs to handle the new 
development, While the neighborhood plan will

06:02.371 --> 06:10.222
identify the efficiency in the infrastructure in 
terms of redevelopment. Well, you mentioned

06:10.242 --> 06:11.484
infrastructure. Is that just one example? That's 
one example. That could be sewer line, water line,

06:14.689 --> 06:17.613
street. Yeah, but I know what infrastructure is. 
But what about things other than infrastructure?

06:23.982 --> 06:25.624
We will also identify that. We will try to study the 
housing conditions. We will study the social

06:29.928 --> 06:33.894
conditions of the area. It will be a complete plan 
now. And transportation. Transportation. Land

06:41.705 --> 06:43.047
use configuration. Land use configuration. Both 
of them. These will all be elements. All be

06:46.633 --> 06:51.900
elements of both reports, but will be looked at 
from a different angle, so to speak. We do have in

06:51.960 --> 06:55.125
the policy manual a... table of contents for each 
of the reports that we have for each kind of the

06:55.696 --> 07:01.347
report that we're going to do. The neighborhood 
plan report or the sector plan report. And it's all

07:04.874 --> 07:09.663
identified in the policy menu. I would like for you 
to review it and maybe give me some comments. from

07:15.153 --> 07:19.958
the academic... You don't know what you're 
saying. We welcome all comments, but we would take

07:19.978 --> 07:24.183
that easily. Yes, I know. Okay, the sector 
planning process has come to a point where we have

07:26.726 --> 07:40.721
divided the sector and make a sector plan report. 
Here's a copy. What it is, is because the way we have

07:45.089 --> 08:02.431
publicize this planning process, it has become a 
very visible type of situation and we want to make

07:45.089 --> 08:02.431
sure all along the planning process, everything 
we do is out in the open with the citizens of Houston

07:45.089 --> 08:02.431
so that they have a chance to comment on it. Now also 
in the... That's a departure in itself. That's a

08:06.036 --> 08:07.978
major departure. Yes. And I think it's probably 
good for the If we want to develop some plan that

08:13.473 --> 08:22.943
will be accepted, I think we have to be involved 
with the residents and whatever people. Secret

08:23.284 --> 08:25.166
planning is never successful. Right. And in our 
planning policy manual, we also have identified

08:25.947 --> 08:35.918
the procedures, how we're going to do each plan. We 
have a critical path chart made up We have

08:40.304 --> 08:45.371
identified that there will be at least two public 
hearings on location. In each of the sectors. In

08:47.654 --> 08:49.196
each of the sectors. And we will also involve a 
group called Technical Advisory Committee,

08:49.216 --> 09:00.751
which is made up of professional people who may or 
may not live in the area. This group, for example,

09:01.171 --> 09:09.602
are AIA, APA, ASCM, who have some general 
expertise of what city's development and growth

09:10.747 --> 09:19.762
and planning is all about and should they have 
their own individual as a group idea of how it

09:10.747 --> 09:19.762
should be carried out. You get a lot of free advice 
that way. Well, we get a lot of free advice and we

09:22.166 --> 09:31.060
also have, when we get done, we will also have a lot 
of concurrence from these people to support the

09:22.166 --> 09:31.060
plans. Oh, absolutely. They're providing you 
technical advice. If we don't, we would have to

09:35.367 --> 09:38.532
justify why we don't. And if we do it, we also have to 
justify within ourselves why we take that. We also

09:45.504 --> 09:50.091
have formed a staff task force. This is the 
technical task force within all the departments

09:50.512 --> 09:58.084
of the City of Houston and some of the governmental 
agencies. in this metropolitan area. We will be

10:01.226 --> 10:20.089
calling our people like the flood control 
district, county engineer's office, HGAC, total

10:01.226 --> 10:20.089
authority, highway department, all the people 
that could provide us with technical expertise

10:01.226 --> 10:20.089
and are out there maybe doing their own long-term 
plans, so to speak. The highway department has a

10:21.938 --> 10:23.860
20-year plan. I just picked up something from them 
so that we would incorporate all this and chat with

10:24.521 --> 10:33.290
them as we go along in doing this plan. We will have a 
public hearing at the very beginning to tell the

10:33.710 --> 10:40.917
residents of the area that we're coming out to do a 
plan for this area. We want their support. We want

10:42.239 --> 10:48.084
their comments and review, and we will be getting 
back to them either as a group. We call them

10:50.377 --> 11:19.978
neighborhood-based association this could be 
the civic organizations or the area association

10:50.377 --> 11:19.978
which is the developers organization

10:50.377 --> 11:19.978
or as individual interested individuals who will 
maintain contact with them all along and we have

10:50.377 --> 11:19.978
identified a planning time period of maybe 18 to 20 
months for each of the plans which is a ambitious

11:20.684 --> 11:31.677
timetable when you think of all these public 
meetings that we have to go through, but I think if

11:20.684 --> 11:31.677
we do it right, we could probably get done. So, and 
also... You said there are 23? There are 23 of them.

11:36.082 --> 11:49.037
We are in the process of hiring professionals to be 
the project planner for each one of these, but we

11:36.082 --> 11:49.037
don't anticipate going to work on all 23. We would 
probably stagger them, and we would say for 18

11:49.456 --> 12:00.069
months for each plane, it might take us as much as 
four to five years to complete all 23. That sounds

12:00.129 --> 12:02.632
reasonable. We don't want to, you know, yeah. We 
want to make sure that what we're doing is

12:05.356 --> 12:09.701
reasonable. And also, when we get all this, you 
call it puzzle type of, When we get all these pieces

12:16.085 --> 12:18.627
of puzzle put together. Cut and paste. Cut and 
paste. I'd rather say puzzle. It's a mystery. But

12:24.913 --> 12:30.238
when we get all done, we will have an entire picture 
together. And part of the reason we wanted to do

12:30.298 --> 12:46.092
summary plans is we know that for certain elements 
of planning, such as transportation, parks and

12:30.298 --> 12:46.092
recreation, you almost have to bring it back 
together, the whole piece for the region. You want

12:46.460 --> 12:53.770
to make sure that when you go through one sector to 
another, it's in line and continuous. But in

12:53.810 --> 12:58.376
general, you still want to look at the picture in 
one piece of document. Well, I think that any

12:58.697 --> 13:01.941
legislative body insists on it eventually. 
Right. So we do see that as the next step, so to

13:02.342 --> 13:06.908
speak. As soon as we finish the sectors and the 
neighborhoods, We will be, if we have the luxury of

13:11.165 --> 13:18.033
extra staff, we might start that process early. 
Now the economic condition of the city did put a

13:18.053 --> 13:24.742
crunch to our dream. Mayor Whitmer said she's 
going to do some more firing. Hopefully we'll not

13:29.327 --> 13:39.079
involve any planning department personnel 
unless it's really a bad person, a bad employee.

13:39.650 --> 13:41.092
Well, you don't have any of those.

13:45.178 --> 13:51.668
Now that we've gone through your process, I think 
we've pretty well finished with that, haven't we?

13:51.688 --> 13:51.968
Yeah. Okay. It's my understanding that Ephraim is 
being criticized currently for not spending

13:53.771 --> 14:06.450
federal dollars quickly enough. And this is 
probably unfair criticism. Would you care to

14:10.824 --> 14:12.387
comment on that? We

14:13.989 --> 14:30.253
inherited an office at the mayor's office that has 
not been

14:13.989 --> 14:30.253
100% efficient, so to speak. Which office was 
that? The Climate Development. Oh, yeah. Okay,

14:33.835 --> 14:35.937
and they were having problems. In fact, before we 
inherited, there was lawsuits against the

14:35.957 --> 14:42.483
director of the office and so on and so forth. 
Lawsuits? Well...

14:44.245 --> 14:48.429
What's her name? Was even indicted. Later on was 
taken off. She was... You didn't know about Audie?

14:57.337 --> 14:58.338
No, I don't think so. Well, we could probably talk 
about those later on, but... But we inherited a

15:01.409 --> 15:16.269
department that is problem-ridden, that has not 
been able to spend all the CD money, so to speak, on

15:01.409 --> 15:16.269
projects. And as time goes on, the HUD offices were 
looking at what year money we haven't spent and how

15:16.289 --> 15:26.603
much money we have spent currently and all that. 
And they discovered that we have so many that's

15:29.303 --> 15:33.068
data back as far as three, four years ago that 
haven't been spent. And I guess to teach us a

15:33.849 --> 15:42.520
lesson, they want to come back and say, well, if you 
can't spend it, you don't deserve it. That

15:42.801 --> 15:48.568
doesn't go over well with the legislative body. It 
never goes over well with the legislative body

15:48.789 --> 15:55.377
when that happens. Whether it's a dollar or a 
million dollars. So Ephraim has to answer some

15:58.531 --> 16:02.196
questions. Yes. Well, that's what he's paid for, 
isn't

16:04.299 --> 16:12.130
it? Yes. Personally, I think through the planning 
department, through the year of Mayor Welch and

16:12.250 --> 16:27.711
the directorship of Roscoe Jones has regressed I 
wouldn't, I don't want to use the word

16:28.096 --> 16:54.863
deteriorated, but regressed in our function,

16:28.096 --> 16:54.863
okay, and maybe also because of the

16:28.096 --> 16:54.863
public works department had taken a lot of the 
responsibility away from us with a strong

16:28.096 --> 16:54.863
director in the person of the

16:57.323 --> 17:05.916
You can put

16:57.323 --> 17:05.916
it in the transcript. Anyway, so that's the 
situation. I think we now are having a hard time to

17:09.280 --> 17:22.740
recapture some of the traditional planning 
functions that the planning department should

17:09.280 --> 17:22.740
carry out. Let me ask you one question that I've 
never been clear about. How does the city of

17:27.344 --> 17:39.095
Houston administer deed restrictions between 
private property owners and private parties? Is

17:39.115 --> 17:41.538
the city a party to any of those agreements? The 
city is not a party to any of those agreements.

17:46.022 --> 17:52.508
However, the city is ready to assist any citizen 
groups that might have problems with somebody

17:52.792 --> 18:21.938
within their group so to speak violating the 
restriction the legal department has provided

17:52.792 --> 18:21.938
legal assistance to the neighborhood 
associations who want to administer the

17:52.792 --> 18:21.938
restriction the planning department has 
provided technical support in studying the

17:52.792 --> 18:21.938
situation and reporting back to the legal 
department We will not initiate any action here

18:22.593 --> 18:28.700
without requests from the citizens. Another 
question. The subject of transfer of development

18:32.084 --> 18:42.996
rights, could you elaborate a little bit on that as 
it's practiced in Houston? The only transfer of

18:43.016 --> 18:48.482
development right that I can think of is the 
transfer of sewer capability. Sewer connection.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.422
Sewer connection, okay. Sewer availability. 
That is the result of having restrictions in the

18:58.486 --> 19:09.660
capacities in the treatment plant in the general 
Houston area. And so it was identified that within

19:10.461 --> 19:18.672
a sewer district, we have so much capacity And this 
capacity is distributed to the vacant land or

19:19.057 --> 19:37.256
being purchased by the vacant land owners, so to 
speak, when they put in a certain development of

19:19.057 --> 19:37.256
sewer capacity money. I think it's $1.86 a gallon 
or something like that at one time. When we were

19:42.882 --> 19:48.068
really doing high growth, I don't think now 
there's a problem. Also, because a lot of the

19:48.402 --> 19:56.714
expansion and new treatment plants are coming 
online that we don't have, we have a slowdown in

19:48.402 --> 19:56.714
development. We have an increase of capacity. So 
it's not a problem. But the transfer development

20:01.221 --> 20:06.970
is really about the sewer capacity. For a while, 
there was quite a business going in the purchase

20:07.090 --> 20:13.880
and sale of sewer connections. That's what I 
heard. That's what I heard also. It was becoming

20:20.071 --> 20:24.637
quite a game in town.

20:29.403 --> 20:38.554
Joe, when the plan is completed in four or five or 
however many years, then how do you anticipate

20:29.403 --> 20:38.554
it's being implemented?

20:42.118 --> 20:47.164
Part of the cell that we are doing for the sector 
plan is that when we identify problems

20:49.000 --> 21:18.940
and identify solutions to that we will add that 
physical solution if it's for example like a

20:49.000 --> 21:18.940
street improvement we will make recommendations 
to the capital improvement committee we identify

20:49.000 --> 21:18.940
it in the plan And it's part of the idea from Ephraim 
that any project that's identified by this plan

21:19.274 --> 21:37.306
that's finally accepted by the planning 
commissioner and endorsed by the planning

21:19.274 --> 21:37.306
commissioner and accepted by the city council. We 
will go through all this. In fact, we'll let our

21:39.169 --> 21:41.994
transmitters and all that. It will be similar to a 
planning document from any other yeah well let's

21:45.413 --> 22:12.450
assume the plan has been adopted by the city 
council right and then what so the project that's

21:45.413 --> 22:12.450
identified in the plan would be pulled out and 
recommended to the capital improvement

21:45.413 --> 22:12.450
committee for action now there are three or four 
ways that projects can get into the capital Well,

22:12.785 --> 22:14.667
Capital Improvement Committee. Well, let's not 
go into that, but that would take care of the public

22:14.707 --> 22:17.949
sector. Right. Right. What about the private 
sector? Private sector, hopefully, that these

22:20.992 --> 22:35.004
plans will be something that they look at as far as 
the development of, like I said, infrastructure

22:20.992 --> 22:35.004
to support their development. If they want to 
build a million square feet of office building in a

22:35.024 --> 22:41.830
certain area and we haven't identified to them the 
necessary sewer capacity or street system to

22:42.215 --> 22:55.169
support that, then they might hopefully want to 
look at some other areas that we already have

22:42.215 --> 22:55.169
identified that kind of improvement there. Or 
they can come back in and the traditional way is to

22:56.330 --> 23:07.242
say that we will help you develop this capability 
in that area so that we can develop our project.

23:07.342 --> 23:11.226
That is perfectly acceptable as far as I 
understand it. What if they come in with a proposal

23:12.522 --> 23:31.119
that is within the overall densities prescribed, 
but the use is not what the plan anticipates? We

23:31.920 --> 23:38.145
will not identify by parcel what use will be 
assigned. No, no, no. I'm not suggesting by

23:38.666 --> 23:40.167
parcel. I'm suggesting that the plan would 
probably be far more general than that. That's

23:44.838 --> 23:45.318
correct. I would doubt if you'd ever want to get 
down to the parcel. No. That would probably be a

23:48.462 --> 23:49.904
mistake. Right. But even so, even for an area, a 
neighborhood area and so forth, that a developer

23:51.125 --> 24:09.006
could conceivably come in with a proposal for uses 
that would not be even compatible with what's

23:51.125 --> 24:09.006
there now, or with what the city has adopted.

24:17.454 --> 24:20.557
Okay, you're on. Okay. What should I say to that? I 
don't know. What do you say to it? How would the city

24:26.963 --> 24:32.269
handle a situation of an incompatible use 
proposal? Hopefully we could go back and talk to

24:32.569 --> 24:38.655
them first to tell them why We identify that as... 
This would be friendly persuasion. That's

24:43.817 --> 24:47.041
probably about the limit of that. Now, I'm sure if 
we identify a wetland area or an area within a

24:47.141 --> 24:58.975
100-year floodplain... Well, that's something 
else, yeah. Let's assume this is all developable

24:59.075 --> 25:03.000
land, all level and ready to go. Then we would 
probably have...

25:10.023 --> 25:18.535
We would have no way

25:10.023 --> 25:18.535
to really stop a project at this time now. A few 
years from now, I don't know, maybe there would be

25:18.875 --> 25:26.366
other legislative power that's given to us. At 
least, maybe I've never given a whole lot of

25:26.386 --> 25:36.039
thought to that particular issue.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.702
Better. Yes. Do you have anything like site plan 
review? Yes, we have now development plan review.

25:49.111 --> 25:49.432
You do. But that's mainly about looking at whether 
it's compatible to the right-of-way lines that we

25:50.834 --> 25:59.765
have set out and so on and so forth. Do you have any 
landscaping requirements? I think there's some

26:03.370 --> 26:07.435
minimum landscaping requirements, but... I 
think one of the things that we may be starting to

26:07.803 --> 26:16.336
look at is to evaluate some merits of projects. I

26:16.356 --> 26:29.997
hate to say it, like what you call when a developer 
has to pay a certain amount to improve the school

26:16.356 --> 26:29.997
system, what's going on. Or contribute to a park 
that's not property. Right. So like what's going

26:34.817 --> 26:42.889
on in Los Angeles, California area, that might be 
something for us to look at for the future. Well, of

26:42.909 --> 26:54.947
course, the College Station test case certainly 
verified that in terms of park contributions.

26:54.987 --> 26:55.107
And by extension that could be done for anything 
that was a valid community service or facility,

26:55.762 --> 27:05.892
needed facility, which was caused by the 
development being constructed. Right. Part of

27:06.693 --> 27:24.570
the work that the data system is working on is 
hopefully with our METRICOM computerized

27:06.693 --> 27:24.570
database, extending it out to the ETJ would be able 
to do some of these kind of studies for certain

27:06.693 --> 27:24.570
projects, like anybody could come in At a certain 
size, we would have some capability of looking at

27:25.023 --> 27:37.619
the impact to the neighborhood, impact to the 
street system, to the sewer system, and all that.

27:37.639 --> 27:37.959
Schools. Right, right. Libraries. Exactly. Fire 
and police. Exactly.

27:51.668 --> 28:03.787
Joel, if you can think of anything else that you 
want to add or something you want to delete, mark it

27:51.668 --> 28:03.787
up on the transcript that we'll be mailing you as 
soon as I can get it transcribed. Sure. Thank you

28:04.488 --> 28:05.850
very much for your time. You're welcome. And for 
sharing your vast knowledge with us in this

28:06.572 --> 28:11.860
important project. I believe that you probably 
have as much seniority as almost anyone in the

28:13.422 --> 28:19.532
department here now, don't you? I have more 
seniority than Ephraim.

28:24.755 --> 28:27.558
You've been here 16 years? Since December of 72, 
after I graduated. Have you given any thought to

28:34.386 --> 28:36.649
working elsewhere? Well, at this time I think I'm 
landing on a project I would really want to get

28:37.690 --> 28:43.056
done. I don't blame you. It would take me five years 
to get it done. I would stay for five years. Sure.

28:51.347 --> 28:58.357
It's really going to be a good project, and the key 
to it is how good a staff I can assemble. Yeah, well,

28:58.577 --> 29:00.680
it sounds potentially very exciting. Yes, 
exactly, and it's something that I always want to

29:01.321 --> 29:06.147
do. Well, you've waited a long time to be able to do 
it. Through the years, we have published some good

29:10.677 --> 29:24.964
reports, and I feel like at times I have done some 
things that is being taken, and it's rewarding.

29:25.465 --> 29:32.078
You know, the planners don't see the fruit of their 
labor, so to speak, like a building from

29:25.465 --> 29:32.078
architect. Well, that's why we have to maintain 
good health so we live long enough to see these

29:32.530 --> 29:38.234
things. Yes. Thanks very much, Joe. Thank you.
