00:04.385 --> 00:08.091
Testing, testing, one, two, three, four, one, 
two, three, four. One, two, three, four, testing,

00:08.651 --> 00:10.855
one, two, three, four. This is the 3rd of April. 
We're in the Cushing Library, room 207, and I have

00:15.221 --> 00:23.434
the pleasure and honor of talking to Professor 
Leonard Ponder. To introduce yourself to a reader

00:24.315 --> 00:32.147
or a listener, give us a biographical summary of 
Family background, growing up, what did mom and

00:33.477 --> 00:36.421
dad do? Where high school, where college? What did 
you do before coming to A&M? I grew up in northwest

00:42.128 --> 00:45.893
Louisiana, a little town called Pleasant Hill. 
Pleasant Hill is about 60 miles south of

00:46.834 --> 00:49.658
Shreveport. Some people know where Shreveport is 
at least. A little village of about 1,000 people.

00:56.026 --> 00:57.208
My dad was a carpenter. I was the baby of five boys. 
My youngest brother is seven years older than me,

01:01.810 --> 01:12.022
which means I was an accident and fully expected to 
be a girl. In fact, my mother quilted a pink quilt

01:12.322 --> 01:19.550
for me, but alas, tomorrow, it didn't work out that 
way. Pleasant Hill High School has fond memories

01:21.773 --> 01:26.799
for that place. I was fortunate enough to play 
basketball there. I was not a great athlete, but

01:32.050 --> 01:34.634
Because it was a small school, nearly everyone 
could play. We started in September and finished

01:35.696 --> 01:38.059
in March. We'd play 50 or 60 games a year. So if you do 
that for five or six years, counting junior high,

01:41.524 --> 01:46.392
you get to where you can play a little. That 
probably kept me in school and interested in

01:47.794 --> 01:54.785
school until I got old enough to realize that that 
was an important thing. Because in my family, my

01:54.885 --> 01:58.210
mother went to the Eighth grade, my dad finished 
the sixth grade. Of course, that's all the school

02:02.312 --> 02:05.437
there was where they were at the time. My mother was 
a teacher for a while. She passed the Louisiana

02:08.140 --> 02:12.727
teacher's test and was able to teach for a year or 
two. So I had a role model from that point of view.

02:17.994 --> 02:24.383
From there, I went to Northwestern State 
University in Natchitoches, which was about 45

02:17.994 --> 02:24.383
minutes from where I grew up. At that time, 
Northwestern had 2,500 students. And I thought,

02:29.308 --> 02:34.435
surely I had died in going to New York City because 
I'd never seen so many people in one place. After

02:35.677 --> 02:42.387
graduating there, I went to Shreveport and taught 
in a brand new school, Oak Terrace Junior High.

02:43.228 --> 02:43.749
What? Oak Terrace Junior High. Oak Terrace, okay. 
And Sunset Acres, which is the western part of, and

02:46.112 --> 02:50.899
Blue Collar part of the town. I was a teacher and a 
coach. I coached football, basketball, and

02:54.788 --> 02:57.190
track. I played basketball and never played a down 
of football. I was very poor. My one loss record in

03:03.496 --> 03:05.478
basketball was very poor. I had a very good one loss 
record in football, probably because I didn't try

03:05.518 --> 03:12.204
to over-encompass the youngsters. But a bigger 
reason was because I had a couple of players that

03:12.244 --> 03:17.409
were pretty good. A guy named Terry Bradshaw was 
one of our quarterbacks. and he was followed up by a

03:21.755 --> 03:24.879
fellow named Joe Ferguson. And of course Haskell 
knows that Bradshaw played for the Pittsburgh

03:25.179 --> 03:34.049
Steelers and Ferguson played for the Buffalo 
Bills after playing for Arkansas. So they made me

03:34.069 --> 03:36.652
better than I was. Were you the head coach? I was 
head coach. And what was the one loss record when

03:40.296 --> 03:42.418
they were there? Well, when they were there, When 
Bradshaw was there, we were like five and three. We

03:47.246 --> 03:49.228
played eight games a year. Ferguson had a better 
year. By then, we had our program going. And I

03:54.294 --> 03:59.100
honestly don't remember the record, but it was 
7-1, 6-2, something like that. But the

04:00.141 --> 04:05.547
interesting thing was neither of those kids threw 
the ball much because we didn't have anyone to

04:00.141 --> 04:05.547
catch it. But they were leaders at that time, and we 
knew they were going to be good high school

04:06.909 --> 04:11.014
players. We didn't know whether they'd be good get 
college and pros. From there, I went to

04:14.788 --> 04:21.495
Southeastern Louisiana University and taught 
for four or five years. I didn't have my doctorate

04:21.916 --> 04:23.257
yet. You had done your master's where? I had 
finished my master's at Northwestern also. While

04:27.822 --> 04:32.267
I was teaching in Shreveport, I went back to 
Northwestern and finished my master's. While at

04:33.368 --> 04:40.075
Southeastern, it became very apparent that if I 
was going to stay in higher education, I needed the

04:33.368 --> 04:40.075
doctorate, so I took a leave of absence and went to 
the University of Tennessee and got my degree

04:40.628 --> 04:46.337
there. From Tennessee I went back to Southeastern 
for a year and then came over here. What year? In

04:52.507 --> 04:52.868
1972. 1972. I came with the whole slug of everyone 
else who came in 1972. How did you and A&M get linked

04:58.156 --> 05:00.680
together? Yeah. Like how did you know there was a 
vacancy and how did they know you existed? I went to

05:05.648 --> 05:07.952
our national meeting. In our field, the national 
organization was the American Association for

05:08.118 --> 05:14.895
Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and 
Dance. And some would say possible safety. It was a

05:16.980 --> 05:18.283
long, lengthy thing. But they had their national 
meeting in Houston. And I went to that meeting. And

05:22.414 --> 05:25.722
they have a very fine placement center. And I went 
there and looked through all the job

05:25.837 --> 05:29.942
opportunities. And of course, A&M was listed. 
They also had an employee section where you could

05:33.186 --> 05:38.472
list your credentials. So I left my credentials. 
And I didn't interview there, nor did I apply for

05:40.654 --> 05:44.779
the job. But I went back to Southeastern. And a 
couple weeks, Carl Landis, who was the department

05:46.581 --> 05:51.507
head, called me and asked me if I'd come for an 
interview. And had you met him? I had never met him.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.747
I saw him at the convention. Someone pointed him 
out to me. But I had not met him. I knew no one at A&M.

06:02.506 --> 06:16.684
Fortunately, the job that I was applying for, they 
were interested in me for, was to direct allied

06:02.506 --> 06:16.684
health education, which was a brand new thing, a 
brand new thing nationally and new on this campus.

06:17.405 --> 06:32.344
Baylor College of Medicine had gotten a grant to 
prepare teachers of allied health so that they

06:17.405 --> 06:32.344
would then in turn take faculty jobs and prepare 
other allied health professionals. And there

06:33.033 --> 06:36.437
just wasn't many applicants because no one knew 
anything about it. And I didn't either, to tell you

06:36.618 --> 06:38.500
the truth. But Carl convinced me that it was a good 
opportunity. And of course, I was impressed with

06:43.727 --> 06:46.691
A&M the minute I walked on campus. All right. And so 
you drove over. I drove over. And describe the

06:50.416 --> 06:55.783
entire visit, particularly the interview 
process. I want to start back a little further than

06:56.270 --> 06:58.132
that. Oh, okay. All right, good. My wife and I had 
been married then seven, I see six, about eight

06:59.054 --> 07:03.820
years. No, ten years, near ten years. Had never had 
a vacation. So that particular summer, we decided

07:08.346 --> 07:12.271
we would, and we had a new baby. We took baby to 
grandparents, and we went down to the Gulf Coast of

07:12.891 --> 07:18.058
Mississippi. And I lay on the beach and took in the 
sun and got so sunburned we had to stand up. We

07:25.892 --> 07:26.734
couldn't even sleep. I couldn't lay down to sleep. 
And we had just come in and the phone was ringing as

07:28.978 --> 07:34.107
we walked in the door and it was Carl Landis. And he 
asked me if I would be at A&M the next day. Oh, my. And

07:38.246 --> 07:41.871
I says, Dr. Landis, I just got here. I just don't 
think I can do that. And he said, well, I'm trying to

07:44.694 --> 07:47.297
get away on vacation. It sure would be nice. Maybe 
you could come partway. And so I told him that we'd

07:51.422 --> 07:53.104
get in. This is like 3 o'clock in the afternoon. So I 
told him we'd go in as far as we could. And, in fact,

07:58.030 --> 08:00.193
we got to Beaumont that night. And then the next day 
drove on in. And I can recall driving through

08:04.327 --> 08:06.670
Navasota. And we didn't go through Hempstead. We 
came in off of 105. And it was desolate, as you

08:14.339 --> 08:16.382
remember back then. There wasn't much back there. 
And of course, Highway 6 ran right through the

08:17.503 --> 08:21.668
heart of Navasota. We topped a hill, and there sat 
A&M, like an oasis. There was nothing, and then

08:28.136 --> 08:29.718
there was a lot. And we found G. Ryder White very 
easily. And I had my wife with me, and we met with

08:34.263 --> 08:42.193
Carl and had a good visit. Of course, Carl Landis, 
as you recall, was very straight and dignified and

08:42.774 --> 08:50.364
very formal in all he did. I don't recall all of the 
interview, but I do recall the interview with

08:51.286 --> 09:00.638
Frank Hubert, who was then dean of education. 
Describe that one. We went into his office and it

09:03.642 --> 09:08.088
was his birthday. And the secretaries had baked a 
cake and he had the cake container on his desk and it

09:09.189 --> 09:16.759
was empty. We came in and of course he did his 
customary Frank Hubert thing with his hands

09:18.642 --> 09:24.269
together. And he began to ask me questions. And

09:29.225 --> 09:39.115
when we got through talking, and my wife was with me 
again, and my wife has never been known to be quiet.

09:39.135 --> 09:41.037
She would not, that just wasn't her. She actually 
was an introvert, but she was very extroverted in

09:41.097 --> 09:45.201
her behavior. And the two of them carried on a nice 
conversation as well. But as we finished, he asked

09:51.328 --> 09:54.591
me if I had any questions. And I said that I did, that 
I'd like to know what the load expectation was,

09:54.942 --> 10:03.795
what the teaching load was. No, I'm sorry. I want to 
know what the research responsibility was.

10:08.382 --> 10:13.329
Because 1972, if you recall, was just about the 
time when that pendulum started swinging. And he

10:14.150 --> 10:18.757
said that it was a considerable research 
responsibility. And then he kind of looked at me

10:18.877 --> 10:23.143
out of the corner of his eye and said, do you have a 
problem with that? And I told him that I wasn't sure

10:24.085 --> 10:28.571
that I did, depending on what the teaching load 
was. And he said, well, it's 12 hours. And I'd been

10:32.676 --> 10:34.818
carrying 15. And 12 hours sounded pretty good. 
When we finished, I don't guess I made a very good

10:39.825 --> 10:44.070
impression on him. Or maybe I asked some of the 
wrong questions. Because years later, Carl

10:46.673 --> 10:48.996
Landis told me that when we walked out, Hubert 
looked at him and said, you don't want ponder, do

10:49.516 --> 10:55.002
you? And Carl said, yes, I do. And Carl told me that 
in the spirit that it wasn't long before that Frank

10:59.667 --> 11:05.634
Hubert had named me department head. And 
apparently I made the team somewhere along the

11:06.355 --> 11:08.718
way. Go back to what do you recall about the 
interview process with Carl Landis?

11:18.575 --> 11:45.797
interesting thing about that he had just he'd had a 
guy named charles corbin and that name might need

11:18.575 --> 11:45.797
to be erased in the final draft you may know it may 
remember him chuck was a very good teacher and and

11:18.575 --> 11:45.797
the students really related to him very well but he 
was kind of a an outlaw in on the faculty he didn't

11:18.575 --> 11:45.797
have much respect for any authority and Now, I 
wasn't here then, but I heard all the stories. And

11:49.103 --> 11:51.687
Carl had been burned by him pretty badly. And rules 
were not for Charles. And so in looking back at the

11:56.595 --> 12:01.582
interview, I understand it better now than I did 
then. But he asked me a lot of questions about how I

12:01.662 --> 12:04.326
felt about a faculty member's role and an 
administrator's role and those kinds of things.

12:09.540 --> 12:15.186
But the thing that really disturbed me the most was 
that the first year I felt kind of shut out. I felt he

12:15.226 --> 12:17.849
was really cold to me. From my perspective, I'd 
worked in a university where a new faculty came in

12:19.391 --> 12:26.979
and they were kind of given the exalted seat for a 
while and a lot of attention and welcoming. I never

12:27.420 --> 12:30.263
felt that the whole time I was there. Later I 
discovered that Carl wanted to be sure that he

12:30.445 --> 12:37.076
never got behind the eight ball with another 
faculty member. And he was a little concerned

12:37.617 --> 12:38.879
about that. Did you get from this first visit, this 
interview visit, did you get any perception of

12:40.000 --> 12:53.382
what the guidelines, the rules, the expectations 
were for a new faculty member?

12:56.281 --> 12:58.224
I think so. Not to the extent that probably I would 
have liked to. I knew from the interview that you

13:06.576 --> 13:11.503
were going to work from 8 to 5. You were going to be in 
your office from 8 to 5, probably. No one was going

13:15.388 --> 13:18.473
to go up and down checking on you, but that was the 
expectation. I also learned, much to my dismay,

13:19.234 --> 13:25.022
that when the students were gone, that doesn't 
necessarily mean the faculty were gone. That was

13:25.525 --> 13:29.931
not modeled anywhere in the country, I suppose.

13:34.117 --> 13:41.327
They made very clear to me what the teaching load 
was and what the expectations in the classroom

13:34.117 --> 13:41.327
were, and they didn't equivocate about that. That 
was laid out pretty closely. The thing that

13:44.171 --> 13:53.203
impressed me more than anything and probably 
removed all doubt was before I left that day, he

13:44.171 --> 13:53.203
made me an offer. and told me what the money was. 
This is the only dollar question all day. All day,

13:58.371 --> 13:58.812
that's right. What was the opening salary, the 
beginning salary? Opening salary was 17,000. For

14:04.185 --> 14:05.348
12 or nine? For 12 months. For 12 months. Now he made 
me the offer and made me the sour quote. I didn't

14:11.601 --> 14:13.624
expect either of those. And instead I had to say I 
need to think about it. Someone, a wise person told

14:18.790 --> 14:25.299
me one time never take a job during an interview 
because you'll take every job you interview for

14:18.790 --> 14:25.299
that way. And so when I went back home we thought 
about it and decided to take the job. And then when

14:32.300 --> 14:36.524
he made the offer, when he actually sent me the 
letter, he had upped it $500. So he quoted me

14:37.044 --> 14:42.849
$17,000, paid me $17,500, and I've never 
forgotten that. And that added to the plus. Oh, no

14:44.671 --> 14:45.292
question. And I used that a few times when I was 
department head. If I could e-cap another $200 or

14:49.335 --> 14:58.664
$300 for someone we were interviewing, I always 
dumped it in because it's a nice message to send.

14:58.704 --> 15:00.846
Make believe that I didn't know Carl Landis. 
Describe him. in your first impressions and then

15:02.557 --> 15:07.166
later. Okay. Very dignified, very matter of fact 
and to the point, doesn't waste words, economy of

15:09.470 --> 15:20.751
words.

15:21.490 --> 15:27.419
very high morals, expects people around him to 
behave that way. A

15:27.439 --> 15:32.806
gentleman in every respect. A military man. He was 
in the military, but later I don't call him, I

15:37.133 --> 15:44.563
wouldn't consider him a military person, but he 
behaved like a military person. As I got to know

15:46.146 --> 15:47.127
him, And this was years later. I discovered that he 
was pretty much a pussycat, very soft-hearted, a

15:49.508 --> 15:59.978
kind man, a

15:49.508 --> 15:59.978
little bit unsure of himself. And probably that's 
why he was so formal. Formality gave him some

16:06.283 --> 16:08.885
structure that he liked.

16:11.508 --> 16:17.333
Now, did you call any friends or anything to find 
out information about him? Actually, I talked to

16:18.325 --> 16:21.330
my major professor at Tennessee. He was the only 
person I talked to. What did they say? What did he

16:23.935 --> 16:24.496
say? He said that he thought it was a good school, 
but don't forget, Leonard, it's a military

16:25.037 --> 16:32.990
school. I remember this is 1972 and the military 
was out of favor at that point. He said that your

16:38.744 --> 16:46.116
degree is health education, your discipline is 
health education, and I don't really believe

16:38.744 --> 16:46.116
they're committed to health education at A&M. I 
think they have health just because it may look

16:46.217 --> 16:50.043
good. Now, that was an indictment on the 
department, not on the university.

16:56.253 --> 17:05.629
But the good thing about it is I knew a lot about A&M 
because being in a general proximity of the state,

16:56.253 --> 17:05.629
I watched them come over and play LSU football And I 
was always in the Army with an Aggie who, in fact, I

17:05.997 --> 17:17.132
served under an Aggie who I thought was one of the 
best commanders I ever had. So I knew a lot already

17:17.172 --> 17:21.157
about them. Then my undergraduate alma mater, the 
guy who was department head at my undergraduate

17:21.177 --> 17:31.130
university was a classmate of mine, a former 
classmate. And he knew a lot about A&M. And I really

17:32.592 --> 17:34.975
depended on him more than anyone else. Did you hear 
any, other than the possibility of the emphasis on

17:35.326 --> 17:44.714
military, did you hear any other negatives about 
A&M as you were trying to check up and learn things?

17:46.176 --> 17:50.320
I don't think I heard anything negative. And I 
probably didn't explore it as deep as someone who

17:50.340 --> 17:55.084
didn't know much about the university would have. 
And this is the fall of 72. One of the ironies is that

17:58.927 --> 18:05.333
Jack Williams, the comparatively new president, 
had just been the chief academic officer of the

18:05.819 --> 18:10.045
University of Tennessee system. That's right, 
and I knew that. Before coming. I knew that, but I

18:11.928 --> 18:13.430
wouldn't have called him. No way I would have 
called him. I understand. I was a student. When he

18:17.015 --> 18:19.598
was at Tennessee, I was a student. In fact, he left 
there while I was a student. Now, the name of the

18:22.482 --> 18:26.768
official title of the department when you arrived 
was what? Health and Physical Education. And it

18:29.022 --> 18:35.393
offered, in general, what did the department in 
those days offer when you arrived? It had one

18:35.413 --> 18:38.798
undergraduate degree, and it was health and 
physical education. People who went through that

18:39.740 --> 18:42.985
primarily were prepared to be teachers. And it was 
primarily to teach physical education. There was

18:47.012 --> 18:54.945
also, I counted there were 11 health courses 
offered, but only six hours in the curriculum at

18:47.012 --> 18:54.945
that time. We had no degree in health, but a number 
of people would take those courses, some of the

18:54.925 --> 19:04.107
elective courses, to beef up their health 
background. Supposedly, they were certified to

19:04.829 --> 19:11.365
teach both health and physical education, but 
they were really qualified to teach physical

19:04.829 --> 19:11.365
education. At the graduate level, we had also a 
degree in health and physical education, and the

19:11.564 --> 19:18.753
doctoral level was just health and physical 
education. And the doctoral degree was already at

19:18.813 --> 19:20.855
that time? It was already at that time. It was brand 
new. I think they were in their third year. Was it an

19:24.700 --> 19:25.761
Ed.D. or a Ph.D. or both? It was both. It was both. 
And do you have any guesstimate when you got here

19:29.706 --> 19:35.833
what the enrollment was in number of majors? As a 
matter of fact, I do. I brought some cheats. I know

19:41.394 --> 19:48.490
I wrote that number down.

19:51.457 --> 19:58.810
Well, in 1979, we had 160 health majors, 535 
physical education. So that's 685, isn't it? And

20:03.419 --> 20:06.464
that was twice as many as we had in 1972. So it's half 
685, whatever that is. I can't do that. And were

20:11.914 --> 20:15.000
there many graduate students when you arrived? 
Not many. They'd had a brand new doctoral program.

20:19.230 --> 20:23.014
Their first class had just about graduated. A few 
strikers from the first class left. And there was

20:25.477 --> 20:28.521
about six or eight of those fellows out there. All 
of them were men. The only woman PhD student at that

20:31.004 --> 20:34.909
time was Gail Smith. You know Norma Gail, I think. 
S-C-H-M-I-D-T? S-C-H-M-I-D-T, yeah. All right,

20:40.516 --> 20:42.338
now... This offer came at about what time on the 
calendar? This was late July. And they needed you

20:48.853 --> 20:50.537
here when? Mid-August. So describe what the 
routine was for you and wife and young child to get

20:53.304 --> 20:58.977
over here. Well, we had just built a house. We'd 
been in it two years, I guess. We built it and then

21:05.445 --> 21:07.948
took a leave of absence, went to Tennessee. So we'd 
only lived in it about two years. We had to sell that

21:10.552 --> 21:11.633
house. And that was, of course, a scramble. But 
fortunately, I never had to put it on the market.

21:16.279 --> 21:19.463
There was someone in the neighborhood who wanted 
to buy it. I actually came earlier than they wanted

21:19.443 --> 21:23.413
me to. I finished my duties at Southeastern in 
about mid-July. Maybe it was later than that.

21:32.216 --> 21:34.482
Maybe it was toward the end of July. And I had no 
other responsibilities to the university after

21:34.782 --> 21:37.385
that. So I packed my bags and came to A&M. I got here 
sooner than Carl expected me to. And I remember

21:44.014 --> 21:46.457
going up two or three. And I didn't realize they 
were still in summer session. I thought they were

21:48.520 --> 21:50.062
out of summer session, too. And I'd come up and look 
for my office. Well, it's not ready yet. And two or

21:53.887 --> 21:55.930
three days, I would do that. We were getting real 
crowded over there then, and so I discovered after

21:56.348 --> 22:05.002
I got here I was going to have to share an office with 
someone else. What was it like to move? Did you move

22:08.367 --> 22:10.570
yourself or a commercial? No, someone moved me. I 
hired a Mayflower company to move in. Of course, no

22:15.839 --> 22:17.341
help from A&M. Describe what the housing 
opportunities were here. What did you find?

22:24.867 --> 22:26.649
Actually, it turned out pretty good. We came over 
here and met with a realtor who happened to be

22:27.149 --> 22:35.979
Robert Smith's brother. It was Robert's wife. I'm 
forgetting her name for some reason. I don't know

22:41.305 --> 22:42.566
why. Richard was just getting his operation going 
good. She showed us around the neighborhood and it

22:48.673 --> 22:51.796
was very good. There were several houses open at 
that time. But, you know, $40,000. And I paid like

22:59.730 --> 23:01.839
18 for mine. And there was just no way I could swing 
that. But what I didn't know, being as young as I

23:04.608 --> 23:09.113
was, is when I sold my house, I sold it for 35. So I 
could have done that. But we really wanted to rent.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.120
And we made that known very early. And much to my 
surprise, she worked with us on that and found us a

23:15.540 --> 23:23.709
rent house,

23:15.540 --> 23:23.709
which was good marketing on her part. Because 
later on, when I got ready to buy a house, I went

23:23.729 --> 23:29.015
straight to her and asked her to have the deal. Do 
you remember what that rent was? Gosh, it was about

23:32.823 --> 23:34.064
150. In College Station or in Bryan? It was in 
Bryan. It was in Bryan. I wanted to get out of

23:39.830 --> 23:46.476
College Station because I wanted to get out and 
know some of the people that were not university

23:39.830 --> 23:46.476
people. Same here. And I don't know if what 
happened to you happened to me, but what happened

23:47.417 --> 23:51.021
to me happened to you. But when I finally built a 
house, or bought a house, it was over on Memorial

23:51.041 --> 23:55.905
Drive near St. Joseph. And nearly everybody over 
there worked for the university anyway. But we've

24:01.122 --> 24:04.227
enjoyed Brian, I'm not sorry I did that. Alright, 
so as you first went to the office, describe the

24:04.988 --> 24:14.104
facilities and the offices and so forth for the 
entire department. They're not good facilities

24:15.045 --> 24:16.708
at all. We were in a new building where I'd come from 
and I was a little disappointed to find that I had to

24:17.670 --> 24:25.763
be partnered with someone and share an office. 
Turned out to be a good thing because that was a guy

24:26.215 --> 24:32.729
named Robert Hurley who was at that time chair of 
the health education program. And we got to be good

24:32.790 --> 24:36.077
friends because we were able to work together. 
Classrooms, the chairs were nailed down,

24:37.179 --> 24:45.237
military listed seats, noisy. And I had visions I 
was going to change all that. I was going to bring

24:49.237 --> 24:51.980
the light of day to this place. That's obviously 
what I discovered very quickly. I wasn't going to

24:54.503 --> 24:55.284
do that. They were satisfied with where they'd 
done things. And where was this? This was all in G.

24:59.829 --> 25:03.754
Riley White, which was an old building then, of 
course. Well, it was built in the 50s, and this was

25:03.834 --> 25:06.217
72. But I also learned... Everything negative I 
heard about A&M I heard after I got here. And there

25:16.836 --> 25:22.225
were things that I didn't think was all that 
negative. One of the first things I heard was

25:23.066 --> 25:28.795
General Rutter's famous statement about Highway 
6 goes both ways. And to be honest with you, I kind of

25:29.676 --> 25:34.123
like that. At first, what did you think that really 
meant, implied? Well, it was told to me in a context

25:40.243 --> 25:48.582
that it was tainted by the way this person 
interpreted it to me. But he was being very

25:49.323 --> 25:52.450
critical of Rutter. He had come from University of 
Illinois and couldn't understand why A&M

25:52.430 --> 25:59.520
couldn't be more like Illinois. And he 
interpreted and expressed it to me as though you

26:00.261 --> 26:08.051
don't dare speak up around here. You say it the way 
we want to hear it and otherwise leave it alone. And

26:13.839 --> 26:15.642
that may have been the way it was said. I didn't 
serve under General Rutter. He had died the year

26:17.044 --> 26:20.108
before I got here and Jack Williams was was 
president. And I really liked him.

26:26.985 --> 26:34.776
There's been a lot of good presidents since I've 
been here, but he was really, really fun to go to a

26:26.985 --> 26:34.776
faculty meeting when he was in China. Let's go 
ahead and talk about him. Make believe I didn't

26:36.860 --> 26:38.923
know him and describe him. I'll never forget the 
first time I met him was at the new faculty dinner.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.514
Were those not great occasions? I don't know if 
they still do that or not, but boy, that was really a

26:47.995 --> 26:51.759
neat day. I hear they don't. That's too bad, 
because my wife and I were invited, of course, and

26:53.181 --> 27:00.189
we didn't know anyone except just a few people we'd 
met in the department. And we all filed in, and I saw

27:01.030 --> 27:06.117
that spread, and I could not believe what they had 
done. Now, keep in mind that what I was

27:07.318 --> 27:13.045
experiencing in the department was kind of a cold 
shoulder, you know, we're not going to, Now, I was

27:13.919 --> 27:16.242
introduced last in the faculty meeting, for 
example. I fully walked in expecting to be the

27:17.042 --> 27:19.545
first one introduced because I was new. Well, that 
wasn't what happened. Well, here was, that had

27:22.669 --> 27:25.512
been turned around 180 degrees. I mean, they're 
treating you like you're the most special person

27:25.572 --> 27:28.976
ever. Jack Williams addressed us after dinner, 
and I have never laughed so hard in my life. I don't

27:34.842 --> 27:39.247
remember everything he said, but I know a couple of 
stories that he told. One was, He said that some of

27:42.083 --> 27:48.670
you know that I've only been president here for 
just about a year. He said, when I first got here, I

27:48.690 --> 27:54.036
got a letter from a guy. You've heard the story 
about him. Please go ahead. I got a letter from the

27:56.418 --> 28:07.770
guy who said, Dr. Williams, when I first heard that 
you were going to be president and you weren't even

27:56.418 --> 28:07.770
an Aggie, I didn't like it very much. But since I've 
been reading about you and Aggie, I think you might

28:08.678 --> 28:14.168
do. But I want you to know I'm watching you damn 
close. And he'd tell that and just beam as he said

28:17.374 --> 28:21.322
it. And then another story he told was he said, you 
know, in administration, friends come and

28:22.885 --> 28:31.581
friends go, but enemies accumulate. And I've 
carried that with me a long, long time. But the

28:36.439 --> 28:38.603
whole evening was just really good. All right. And 
the result of that evening in your feelings was

28:39.164 --> 28:44.175
what? What did you and your wife think when you 
drove? Very, very positive. Very positive. There

28:49.426 --> 28:50.228
was no... I was beginning to wonder if I had made the 
right move. But that evening turned that thinking

28:53.498 --> 28:57.084
around almost entirely. But you asked me about 
Jack Williams. I was being a new assistant

29:00.489 --> 29:02.712
professor. I didn't have a lot of interaction with 
him. Nearly all the interaction I had was formal.

29:09.703 --> 29:14.511
But he had a delightful sense of humor. a great 
speaking voice, put you at ease, or at least I felt

29:14.896 --> 29:22.129
he put you at ease very quickly. I found out later 
that he also was a tough nut to crack. You had to have

29:25.796 --> 29:29.383
your duck lined up to get through that gentleman.

29:32.950 --> 29:34.272
It really was It really was too bad that his health 
turned the way it did, because he had this

29:34.741 --> 29:42.691
university movement in leaps and bounds. Let me 
add in, this is an editorial note. I was at that

29:48.038 --> 29:53.345
point a new administrator. My title was Assistant 
Vice President for Academic Affairs. And as we

29:57.831 --> 30:03.398
were looking forward that fall to planning the 
faculty orientation, One day I went in Dr.

30:03.665 --> 30:07.850
Williams' office and he told me to take charge of 
that. And I began to tell him how poorly it had been

30:08.571 --> 30:12.014
done in the past. And so he said, if you know so much 
about how it ought to be done, you plan it. So what we

30:18.882 --> 30:31.056
tried to do was to have a day of a bit of a tour of the 
campus for new faculty and spouses and to

30:18.882 --> 30:31.056
encourage as many of them to come as possible. and 
to take them to a few of the places where the average

30:32.065 --> 30:37.113
faculty member wouldn't ever get to go. Then that 
evening, to have a formal dinner, everyone dress

30:37.153 --> 30:51.876
up, department heads, new faculty, deans, and so 
forth, and then have Dr. Williams make one of those

30:37.153 --> 30:51.876
speeches that he could do so well. And then I think I 
said on that first one, I know I did in the later

30:53.158 --> 30:58.326
ones, And conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, this 
evening will be a success if, when you are driving

30:59.048 --> 31:12.265
home this evening, one of you looks at the other and 
says, honey, I'm kind of glad we're here. Our hope

31:14.187 --> 31:24.600
was to get everybody off to a positive start and to 
begin to build a feeling of community, of working

31:14.187 --> 31:24.600
together. And Dr. Williams was so encouraging in 
that regard that it made it an effort of joy.
