00:08.148 --> 00:11.532
This is March 30, 1988. We're in the class of 
planning 654. Our guest today is Mr. Leon Wilhite,

00:15.896 --> 00:25.126
a graduate of the Department of Urban and Regional 
Planning in May of 1971. Leon was one of our first

00:25.266 --> 00:32.374
graduates and has had one job since he left the 
department. He's been in the governor's office in

00:32.955 --> 00:35.978
Austin ever since. and has lived through five 
different governor terms, one of which has been

00:36.295 --> 00:42.945
repeated. And I want to familiarize the class a 
little bit with state planning and the

00:43.767 --> 00:59.110
possibilities that abound at state level for many 
of our graduates and the need for good planners at

00:43.767 --> 00:59.110
the state level. Leon? It's a pleasure to have you 
here today, as always, and we're looking forward

01:01.996 --> 01:09.827
to what you can tell us about your longevity in 
Austin. Good. I would like to make this as informal

01:11.550 --> 01:24.549
as we can, and I know some of you, one person needs to 
leave at 3.30, and if you get really tired of this,

01:11.550 --> 01:24.549
you can raise your hand, and I'll let you go, if 
that's all right. Bob was always a tough

01:25.230 --> 01:27.693
taskmaster in school. He was always... But I think 
we ought to just consider this an informal

01:29.148 --> 01:38.158
discussion. And if you have questions or you'd 
like to make comments about Bob, we'll just go

01:38.939 --> 01:45.727
ahead and say it. He was always a fun professor to be 
around because he tells you exactly the way he

01:46.147 --> 01:52.354
feels. I think he encourages other students to do 
the same thing. We did. We told him. Didn't we? I do

01:59.946 --> 02:02.349
remember. OK. I handed out a little outline of 
discussion. I'd like to whip through this fairly

02:06.274 --> 02:07.916
quickly. Give us a little time to discuss what 
you're interested in talking about. Starting

02:11.901 --> 02:18.388
back, let me tell you a couple of things about 
myself. I started working in the governor's

02:18.529 --> 02:22.273
office in 1971. Back then, we had a division called 
the Division of Planning Coordination. When I

02:27.039 --> 02:37.471
joined that staff, it was known pretty much around 
the country as being a policy planning staff, a

02:27.039 --> 02:37.471
fairly progressive policy planning staff. Bob, 
of course, dealing with California and other

02:38.012 --> 02:48.544
parts of the country, was much more familiar with 
the traditional planning. Come in. Here's a seat

02:50.045 --> 02:51.467
just for you. But the division planning 
coordination in the governor's office was a

02:51.835 --> 03:06.598
policy planning office, and we won national 
awards during that period of time and was fairly

02:51.835 --> 03:06.598
nationally known. I was really pleased to join 
that staff and was excited over the couple of years

03:06.678 --> 03:16.493
there, the first couple of years out of school. It 
was a dynamic office. I guess the average age was

03:18.544 --> 03:22.168
around 26 to 28. The director was 32. And so it was a 
real fun time. It was a dynamic time, a real

03:28.695 --> 03:33.000
challenge for us all. I'll talk a little bit more 
about the governors and the styles. But let's talk

03:38.366 --> 03:43.392
quickly about planning the legislation.

03:44.148 --> 03:57.565
Life didn't begin in 65, but it seemed like in any 
kind of planning responsibility, they really

03:44.148 --> 03:57.565
didn't use much terms in state government before 
about 1965. And we had a law passed in 65 that

03:58.065 --> 04:06.636
created the ability for local governments to form 
regional planning commissions. And that's in

04:07.277 --> 04:09.700
Article 1011M. Most of you have access to Vernon's 
here at the school if you have any interest in

04:10.237 --> 04:17.406
looking up these laws, you're welcome to. Let me 
just say also, early 70s, we compiled a book. It's

04:22.572 --> 04:29.080
really, they're out of print right now, but this 
was the legal basis for planning in Texas. And I

04:29.100 --> 04:39.152
mean, this is a real, it breaks it down 
functionally in education, general government,

04:29.100 --> 04:39.152
natural resource. It's a very extensive 
document, and anything that relates at all to the

04:40.443 --> 04:47.209
planning, they have it listed in here. So it's 
something, I don't know, Bob, if you've ever seen

04:47.910 --> 04:50.732
this or not, have you? I never have. We've been 
keeping it secret from Bob. I was wondering if

04:54.035 --> 04:59.440
there's any one body of planning law in Texas. Not 
other than what's in here. There's no real body of

05:01.602 --> 05:05.446
single place. This is scattered throughout the 
state hall. But if you have interest or want to

05:10.210 --> 05:12.273
research that. I wouldn't be surprised if your 
library didn't have this. I can work through Bob if

05:17.339 --> 05:21.464
anyone really thinks that's interesting. I'll 
share that with you. But anyway, in 1967 was the

05:24.427 --> 05:32.257
first year that we appropriated law for regional 
planning. We created regional councils

05:32.277 --> 05:36.522
beginning back in 65, 66. We appropriated 
$250,000 for the 24 regional councils. We also, in

05:42.734 --> 05:51.225
1967, created a law that said that the governor was 
chief planning officer of the state. Those are

05:52.207 --> 05:54.169
broad general comments. The law was about a 
one-page law. It said the governor could create

05:59.196 --> 06:06.525
interagency planning councils, which meant that 
they were agency heads. state government agency

06:06.893 --> 06:13.862
heads, the governor could form these councils to 
work on issues. We had back in the, I guess the

06:14.683 --> 06:25.255
primary time that I recall, we had about five or six 
that were functionally broken down like natural

06:14.683 --> 06:25.255
resources, human services, and so forth. But this 
is as close to a cabinet form of government that we

06:25.296 --> 06:30.282
have. It's where the governor can form a council 
with agency heads to work on issues and problems.

06:37.863 --> 06:45.369
It was, I think, a breakthrough in Texas because, 
again, we just hadn't had any state-level

06:37.863 --> 06:45.369
planning laws. And it was an approach where the 
governor could actually call these guys together

06:45.849 --> 06:52.815
and work on issues. I wanted to bring out to you that 
I don't know if it's typical or not, but in my

06:54.757 --> 07:03.044
experience, I think it's fairly typical. The 
federal government tends to make states do what

07:04.522 --> 07:07.005
they ought to do. You know, being a states' rights 
kind of a guy that I am, I have to really choke on

07:08.506 --> 07:13.772
those words. But many times we find that the 
federal government makes us do things that we

07:13.852 --> 07:18.257
should do. Planning is one of those areas. 701

07:21.280 --> 07:30.310
planning, in fact, was the primary reason that we 
created a planning shop in the governor's office.

07:31.011 --> 07:33.313
It provided a basic planning pot of money to hire 
planners. And of course, that's waned. I think the

07:40.747 --> 07:47.355
last year that states got 701 planning money was 
about 78 or 79. But just on your list, we also had

07:48.817 --> 07:55.406
quite a bit of planning funds in the 
transportation area. The Department of

07:57.589 --> 08:00.853
Transportation funded fairly substantial 
planning shops in both the state level as well as

08:01.357 --> 08:06.442
regional and local levels. Then the old HEW, 
Health Education Welfare, back in the, I guess

08:07.663 --> 08:28.343
through about maybe mid-70s, was a major federal 
agency that funded everything from health

08:07.663 --> 08:28.343
planning to family planning to different kinds of 
issues. I really think any time you're looking at

08:28.576 --> 08:39.193
state-level planning in Texas or any other state, 
you've got to recognize that the federal

08:28.576 --> 08:39.193
government played a fairly major role. What I'd 
like to do is walk through the governor's role in

08:40.635 --> 08:46.584
all of this. And I will throw in a few words,

08:47.405 --> 08:56.760
I guess, of really how good these guys were. I'm a 
little bit uncomfortable with Bob's Rick Carter

08:57.044 --> 09:07.315
here, but I'll throw some in, and then we can cut it 
off, and I can tell you really what I think. John

09:08.156 --> 09:18.587
Conley was, of course, a Democrat in those days, 
was a strong governor, had a lot of charisma, a lot

09:08.156 --> 09:18.587
of energy. He had a governor's staff in those early 
days of, you know, I think he had one to maybe five

09:27.267 --> 09:30.290
max program type staff. We have probably 150 now, 
just to give you a feel. And we're small now

09:35.795 --> 09:38.178
compared to what we used to be. But Connolly had, I 
mean, there just wasn't much in the governor's

09:38.878 --> 09:42.942
office. They had a scheduler, and they had a few 
people like what we'd call personal staff, but

09:43.623 --> 09:51.491
nothing in the program area. Back in those days, 
Terrell Blodgett was the governor's executive

09:51.831 --> 09:57.156
assistant, and he was kind of a program staffer. He 
was really more of a personal aide. A guy named Jim

10:01.382 --> 10:10.455
Ray, who's still around Texas, was the first 
planning director in the governor's office, and

10:01.382 --> 10:10.455
he was under John Connolly. Back at that day, they 
were just beginning to do planning. They were, in

10:15.763 --> 10:23.153
fact, the first planning grant that they got under 
Connolly in terms of federal planning money was

10:15.763 --> 10:23.153
the health plan. They were able to get a grant. It's 
funny that we that the first planning grant that we

10:28.287 --> 10:36.938
get in the state was health planning, which has 
always been kind of a side issue. But it was at least

10:37.579 --> 10:45.889
a couple of years during the health planning 
funding days that we finally got the 701 plan. But

10:46.610 --> 10:52.397
under Connolly, I consider those days the 
beginning years. The laws were passed relative to

10:52.757 --> 10:56.522
regional planning and state chief planning 
officer, governor laws. But there was a very small

11:02.002 --> 11:04.025
staff. They began at that time creating regional 
planning councils, as I mentioned earlier. When I

11:09.854 --> 11:21.751
say the governor's staff, they'd literally go out 
and meet with city and county governments, and

11:09.854 --> 11:21.751
they'd start explaining to them how they could 
form a regional planning body, what the body ought

11:09.854 --> 11:21.751
to do. And they did what I call missionary work in 
the planning, trying to get some of the stuff done.

11:28.863 --> 11:31.247
This was done by a very small staff. As Jim Ray 
continued, he probably had no more than five

11:31.467 --> 11:39.620
planners on board at that point. About that time, 
Preston Smith came into office, 1969. Preston, to

11:46.091 --> 11:48.615
me, was one of the better governors. And let me 
define a better governor, I guess a better

11:49.439 --> 12:12.786
governor to me is a chief type leader that can 
select top staff that gives them their head and

11:49.439 --> 12:12.786
allows them to be innovative, creative, that will 
listen to the staff, you know, a lot, you know,

11:49.439 --> 12:12.786
obviously, the decision makers going to make the 
decisions. But as a The planning director ought to

12:14.465 --> 12:31.205
feel very comfortable with recommending 
anything to the governor, giving him the pros and

12:14.465 --> 12:31.205
the cons to the political action or political 
ramifications, as well as the positives and

12:14.465 --> 12:31.205
negatives. To me, the Preston Smith days, I think, 
were almost the Camelot years in planning. Dan

12:39.876 --> 12:43.560
Petty was the director during most of that time. 
And Ed Grisham was a guy that finished up the last

12:43.979 --> 12:48.143
couple of years. And this was the years. And I 
wanted to point out that we had, I guess,

12:50.705 --> 13:02.415
Goldsboro, Texas probably was one of the primary 
reasons, Bob, that our little shop got national

12:50.705 --> 13:02.415
acclaim. Goldsboro, Texas really put the state 
planning office in Texas on the map. We had two

13:08.600 --> 13:11.803
phases, phase one, phase two. Then we had phase 
three. That was the budget that, at that time, we

13:14.641 --> 13:24.275
were still struggling over how you deal with 
planning and how you deal with financing

13:14.641 --> 13:24.275
planning. And we've still been struggling over 
that ever since. But at that time, they said, you

13:27.639 --> 13:33.368
know, really, if you do proper planning, it ought 
to play into the budget. And the budget and the

13:33.388 --> 13:36.872
planning ought to be kind of together. Well, this 
year, we produced a program-type budget where the

13:37.293 --> 13:43.602
goals for Texas and the budget document were 
actually kind of merged, where we do have in the

13:44.273 --> 13:50.862
budget. Let me skip that. We do have a budget to 
where they actually break it down functionally.

14:01.897 --> 14:08.545
Most of the state budgets have always been agency 
by agency. And this is the first where they broke it

14:08.646 --> 14:11.209
down functionally, like education, general 
government, health, human resources, natural

14:11.932 --> 14:18.119
resources. And it was the primary, like, ten 
functions. You start talking about planning,

14:21.363 --> 14:33.898
ten, I don't know if ten's a good round number or 
not, but that's kind of the, if you'll break it down

14:21.363 --> 14:33.898
any time, you'll come up with a round ten. This was a 
good piece of work, and a work that I think really

14:39.218 --> 14:40.919
did put us on the map. It actually got into talking 
about what an objective was, what a goal was. Not

14:46.584 --> 14:56.973
only two year, five year, 10 year goals, but it had a 
little section in front of the Goals for Texas book

14:46.584 --> 14:56.973
that actually explained that stuff. And nothing 
that I ever knew had ever gotten to that point of

14:56.993 --> 15:03.419
explaining what planning was. And so I really 
still tout it as being a very important piece of

15:04.139 --> 15:08.483
work. Leon, as I understand it, that was the result 
of a compilation of inputs from the regional

15:08.817 --> 15:16.026
councils of government. Yes. Let me just, for fun, 
pass around, if y'all will, about half of you.

15:27.520 --> 15:33.728
The goals program that was done, I mentioned the 
creation of regional councils. Before we created

15:34.870 --> 15:36.732
regional councils, We created the article 1011M 
that I mentioned earlier back in 1965. It said that

15:41.989 --> 15:51.700
the state would be divided up by the governor and 
that there would be regional councils formed in

15:41.989 --> 15:51.700
each of the areas. So if you look, the dark heavy 
line divides up each of the 24 regions. And as Bob

15:59.230 --> 16:07.039
pointed out, the phase one program was to go out so 
to speak, to the people, trying to get out to the

16:07.205 --> 16:10.608
folk. What do you think about it? What do you think 
the goals for the state really are? And they used

16:15.273 --> 16:16.995
the regional councils. By that time, there were 
24. And I remember as a student in the planning

16:19.497 --> 16:27.065
school, I went over to Brazos Valley Development 
Council. And the governor's staff came down. And

16:29.827 --> 16:33.651
they were talking about the goals program and 
trying to create goals. And I sat through some of

16:34.053 --> 16:38.680
the committee meetings where they were 
formulating goals. And it was kind of a neat

16:38.700 --> 16:40.362
experience. But this

16:41.083 --> 16:48.194
program is still one of the highlights of my time. 
Let me just mention Bob's book here. This is one

16:51.820 --> 16:53.502
that I didn't bring with me. Another piece of work 
that was done during the Preston Smith day was the

16:54.323 --> 17:00.492
Urban Development Commission. At that time, we 
were really trying to look at urban problems,

17:03.888 --> 17:05.911
urban issues. We were getting to have a congestion 
or highway transportation problems. And Mayor

17:11.758 --> 17:23.133
Vandergriff out of Arlington was the the 
chairman, very impressive guy, very forward

17:11.758 --> 17:23.133
thinking guy. If you look down some of the 
commissioners, there were really some

17:23.774 --> 17:30.503
impressive folks on this. And it was a a real 
credible piece of work. I don't know if you've ever

17:36.231 --> 17:41.417
shown this to them, but this is Bob's copy. And I 
think if you'll look at some of the issues that were

17:42.198 --> 17:50.750
laid out in this book, this was just remembering 
this was done in 1970. So we're 18 years. But a lot of

17:54.635 --> 18:03.426
the issues laid out here, if we had really worked on 
the issues as we should have and could have, we

17:54.635 --> 18:03.426
would have been in much better shape. Also, Bob had 
a couple of other things that you can corner him on

18:04.925 --> 18:13.093
if you ever need to get into this. There were some 
pieces of work, land use planning work done.

18:16.997 --> 18:21.341
Again, this was HUD funded, 701 Housing and Urban 
Development funded. Some very forward thinking

18:22.362 --> 18:24.965
work done. This was a piece of work done at the very 
end of the Connolly administration, talking

18:25.926 --> 18:34.594
about model cities, if you look back over some of 
the history of urban problems and urban issues,

18:35.063 --> 18:43.255
Model Cities was an effort to try to deal with that. 
I saw a smile back in the back. Do you know about

18:45.619 --> 18:46.881
Model Cities? Were you ever involved in it, or no? 
He wrote an excellent paper on Model Cities. On

18:52.789 --> 18:54.612
Model Cities? I don't know how to assess whether it 
was any good or not. John Shanahan, that was

18:58.317 --> 19:04.767
probably the first student going through this 
department, He was working on his Ph.D. when I was

19:05.270 --> 19:07.733
here. I don't know how he was doing that because he 
was working, too. I don't know. He was probably

19:12.278 --> 19:16.402
illegal. Illegal. But anyway, John Chanahan was 
up in the governor's office of state-local

19:19.746 --> 19:31.318
relations at that time and was working on model 
cities back in those days. I still see John. He's a

19:33.060 --> 19:34.922
consultant out of Houston, I believe. Making 
megabucks. He's gone into insurance now. Oh, is

19:38.372 --> 19:39.674
he? Maybe. That's why he's making megabucks. 
Insuring cellbooks. I really think those, again,

19:45.923 --> 19:51.351
Preston Smith days, great. Let me try to move into 
the Doff Briscoe era. Governor Briscoe was a

19:57.440 --> 20:02.968
wealthy landowner, one of the largest single 
landowners in the state of Texas. He owns much of

20:03.674 --> 20:05.676
South Texas. So when you saw the land use documents 
that you were looking at, this was actually done in

20:07.117 --> 20:16.887
Preston Smith days. But some of this work, I don't 
know if this one was the one or not, but some of this

20:17.007 --> 20:25.996
work was actually not distributed until Dolph 
Briscoe came into office. And I remember it being

20:26.016 --> 20:29.600
held up for four to six months. And even people 
commenting on maybe Had to sue him or something to

20:31.788 --> 20:34.112
get this stuff up. He was not going to literally 
distribute this land use planning stuff because

20:34.152 --> 20:40.182
it was a communist plot kind of stuff. He really 
hated land use planning. The whole concept and

20:44.569 --> 20:53.644
thought of any kind of regulation on landowners or 
limitation of what one can do. Yeah, I had trouble

20:54.045 --> 20:55.247
getting these. for that reason. He probably 
really wouldn't want to give you one. No,

20:59.085 --> 21:00.467
particularly. But, you know, in your career of 
planning, it's a little philosophical, but

21:01.948 --> 21:21.927
wherever you wind up, be it a city, county, or 
state, or federal government, you'll find at

21:01.948 --> 21:21.927
times you've got to do something, even if you're in 
an office that's not willing to do something. I

21:22.143 --> 21:31.834
found through my career that there are times when I 
was hell-bent on getting something done, and the

21:22.143 --> 21:31.834
governor just didn't think it was the right thing 
to do. As a staff, sometimes your integrity and

21:32.855 --> 21:39.883
other things just tell you you've got to do 
something. This piece of work was done in 1978.

21:42.646 --> 21:47.812
Even though Doc Briscoe hated land use planning, 
we were able to get this document out. We continued

21:47.872 --> 21:50.715
to tell him it was no big deal. a very limited 
effort, no problems, and we wound up, we didn't

21:51.269 --> 21:59.139
give you that one either. This is a document, 
though, that I still think, by 78, is a fairly

21:59.159 --> 22:13.337
credible piece of work in terms of just trying to 
recap where the state was at that time and trying to

21:59.159 --> 22:13.337
make some projections. Doc Briscoe, let me just 
try to say a little bit more about Doc. I think the

22:17.963 --> 22:21.107
only thing that I can say really strong about Doc 
was that he did allow us to do the interagency

22:21.661 --> 22:42.482
planning council thing that I mentioned earlier, 
where you have like the Parks and Wildlife

22:21.661 --> 22:42.482
Department, agency head, water resources, air 
control board, all of those state agencies

22:21.661 --> 22:42.482
sitting around the table like we are here talking 
about what our problems are. Briscoe allowed that

22:43.703 --> 22:45.845
to happen. Briscoe was not one of the take charge 
kind of governors, so he's not the type guy that

22:49.825 --> 22:52.168
would sit with those agency heads. But we wound up 
having a planning director that felt confident

22:52.729 --> 23:00.279
enough to do that and demand certain things. So

23:00.840 --> 23:10.013
James M. Rose was the planning director for the 
first three years. And he was an extremely

23:10.794 --> 23:14.238
confident type guy. And I found out later on that he 
used a lot of the governor's name. to get things

23:19.525 --> 23:23.992
done that the governor never would have actually 
let us do. Was he from Corpus Christi? No, he's from

23:27.156 --> 23:27.958
Austin. From Austin. From the Austin area. Let me 
just say that back in 1976, I mentioned the

23:33.446 --> 23:39.755
planning and budget struggle. After James M. Rose 
left us to go be the water czar for the state of

23:41.518 --> 23:47.727
Texas, Dickie Travis became the director of our 
combined budget and planning office. Again, we

23:56.365 --> 24:00.450
were all struggling over how to deal with the 
budget functions and the planning functions. So

24:00.831 --> 24:02.213
we said, OK, we'll solve this. We'll just combine 
them. Seemed like a good idea at the time. But I'm

24:08.201 --> 24:16.752
here to tell you, I don't know if you'll ever have an 
opportunity to deal with that in your career. But

24:17.474 --> 24:25.385
any time you've got the budget and planning 
functions combined, I guarantee you the budget's

24:17.474 --> 24:25.385
going to outweigh, overpower. And again, if you 
had just the right kind of director and

24:26.126 --> 24:33.077
leadership, you could make it work. But it's been 
my experience that the importance, the continued

24:33.097 --> 24:45.895
prodding about budget work, when you're having 
budget and planning people work at either What we

24:46.499 --> 24:59.751
were trying to do is merge where the expert on 
transportation was the policy planner and was

24:46.499 --> 24:59.751
also the budget analyst for the governor's 
office. And it was just very difficult for that

25:00.732 --> 25:06.137
kind of thing to happen. Philosophically, it 
should. It should be able to work. But I never found

25:10.221 --> 25:14.565
it to work very well. Bill Clements came into 
office in 79. He was the first Republican in 100

25:17.419 --> 25:21.806
years since Reconstruction. Everybody was 
surprised. Old John Hill was, most of you are not

25:24.291 --> 25:41.059
Texas, you don't know about these things, but John 
Hill was the Democratic nominee and was already

25:24.291 --> 25:41.059
over with the rulers, sizing up the office spaces 
and begun trying to figure out where the pictures

25:24.291 --> 25:41.059
should be hung. And here old Bill Clements came up 
and won. It took us for at least six months to try to

25:47.346 --> 26:05.089
get our bearings, because there really weren't 
that many Republicans in Texas, and there weren't

25:47.346 --> 26:05.089
that many Republicans that would do governor's 
office kind of work. $20,000 to $30,000 a year when

26:05.558 --> 26:10.202
most of the Republicans were millionaires. It 
just didn't work. So we all were struggling around

26:12.885 --> 26:17.169
trying to figure out how to get the job done. A guy 
named Paul Rotenberry, who had been an IBM

26:17.529 --> 26:27.979
executive, became our budget and planning 
director. And his main claim to fame was MBO,

26:27.999 --> 26:33.945
management by objectives, and implementing all 
kinds of management kinds of techniques. This was

26:40.463 --> 26:58.304
kind of a new thing to me because when I started 
thinking about planning, my education here was a

26:40.463 --> 26:58.304
process where you gather facts and analyze them, 
synthesize them, come up with goals and

26:40.463 --> 26:58.304
objectives. Really using management by 
objectives, it's really a planning process. It

27:04.942 --> 27:10.728
was, you know, developing objectives, trying to 
lay out where you're going to be by certain times.

27:10.748 --> 27:15.173
So that all of that seemed to be very interrelated. 
I really think that, you know, if you look at

27:16.034 --> 27:29.308
anything that the Clements first term did, it was 
to try to reshape government to actually begin

27:16.034 --> 27:29.308
thinking about where they're going. I think that 
would be a little checkoff mark I would give

27:32.161 --> 27:35.444
Clements for his first term. His other major piece 
was a Texas 2000 commission that was another blue

27:35.945 --> 27:48.617
ribbon kind of a commission similar to the Urban 
Development Commission I mentioned earlier. It

27:49.438 --> 27:57.426
was a forward-thinking commission focused 
primarily on the economic of the future, trying to

27:57.912 --> 28:04.360
project the population, the future budget 
revenue pictures, and how they merge. It was at

28:04.781 --> 28:18.219
that time in the, oh, about 80, along 80 and 81 was 
our first major time of struggling over the oil

28:04.781 --> 28:18.219
revenue dropping dramatically. So we wound up 
really having a struggle with what we're going to

28:18.940 --> 28:23.025
do in the future. Were consultants used by the 
state government on that? Consultants? This was

28:29.112 --> 28:38.904
staffed by Clement's type deal, where his whole 
deal is a public-private partnership stuff where

28:29.112 --> 28:38.904
you steal staff. This staff was, you know, the 
director was named Vic Arnold of this particular

28:39.125 --> 28:44.752
commission. He was stolen from the University of 
Texas. They had to loan him. He was a great, he was a

28:49.217 --> 28:51.200
good guy. He had been from one of the northern 
states, had been a planning director. But he was

28:58.106 --> 29:00.728
staff director for this. And then we stole about 
six or eight key staff out of state government,

29:00.889 --> 29:07.576
some of the real top people. And that's 
uncharacteristic. But by robbing, stealing, and

29:10.499 --> 29:15.324
conniving, we were able to produce. This was one 
report, and they produced another one about twice

29:15.644 --> 29:19.168
as thick. on more detailed information about the 
Texas 2000. Again, they started, you know,

29:23.333 --> 29:32.242
strategic planning seemed to be a term talked 
about during these days. Vic was real big on

29:32.382 --> 29:34.924
strategic planning. Not comprehensive 
planning, but strategic planning. Because

29:38.528 --> 29:45.855
oftentimes you have to really struggle over what 
folks really mean by those terms. Let me talk.

29:48.342 --> 29:50.024
briefly about Mark White. I was talking to Bob 
before I came in here, and I've got sour grapes a

29:50.704 --> 29:59.973
little bit over this, but I'll share it with you. 
Mark White had the image. He was a young, for terms

30:01.575 --> 30:07.700
of our governors, he's a young guy, progressive.

30:10.683 --> 30:16.729
He wound up hiring the planning director was Ed 
Grisham, who or really that's not his title, but

30:17.198 --> 30:24.567
something close to that, who had been the director 
back in the Preston Smith days. So I knew that Ed

30:24.587 --> 30:28.712
knew how to shake and move and get things done. So 
Hardin Wiedemann came, who was a business-type

30:29.452 --> 30:34.839
man out of Dallas. But he was like a Harvard 
graduate, very sharp guy. A lot of expectations

30:41.226 --> 30:43.389
were raised. I thought, man, we're going to get 
some good stuff done. And really we found, as the

30:47.371 --> 31:05.678
administration wore on, that Mark White was not 
supportive of planning, that the initial things

30:47.371 --> 31:05.678
that occurred were just, you know, he was taking 
advice early on to hire this Ed Grisham, and he was

30:47.371 --> 31:05.678
not comfortable with it. Within six months, they 
completely reorganized, and anything with the

31:06.198 --> 31:17.074
title planning was just kind of shoved aside, and 
it was strictly, quote, I don't want to plan, I just

31:06.198 --> 31:17.074
want to get things done. and I think was a demise of 
that particular governor. Just a lot of neat

31:23.897 --> 31:32.188
things that we could have done with a little 
foresight and then into the action. Bill Clements

31:32.509 --> 31:34.571
beat him. Very close election. But again, I think a 
lot of it was because Mark White didn't have the

31:41.388 --> 31:45.072
management skills to really run an office. Again, 
that goes back to being able to pick good people and

31:45.473 --> 31:55.525
get the heck out of the way and be at the right place 
at the right time in terms of providing the

31:45.473 --> 31:55.525
leadership. I'm speaking like a staff guy, but 
that's the way I feel about it. Probably has

32:00.251 --> 32:02.594
something to do with the campaign, if I may say. 
Campaign and true, and it never ended really. Lack

32:09.562 --> 32:10.483
of research. Yeah, yeah. Let me just say, Bill 
Clements, let me talk briefly about that and then

32:11.999 --> 32:22.869
move into the sort of the current initiatives, 
which really picks up what Clements is doing now.

32:24.190 --> 32:33.279
Bill Clements came in this time and, again, put a 
former legislator, Bob Davis, over the budget

32:24.190 --> 32:33.279
planning shop. And I think, you know, I thought 
over time I felt like budget has always

32:34.220 --> 32:39.745
overpowered planning. By the time Bob Davis came 
and organized it, I thought they were going to drop

32:40.315 --> 32:48.142
planning out of the name. But they decided to leave 
it. And there was just not much planning done. I

32:53.146 --> 32:57.910
transferred to a new office in the governor's 
office called the Governor's Office of State

32:53.146 --> 32:57.910
Affairs. It's about a six to seven person policy 
staff. And it's been a real experience for me over

33:03.555 --> 33:09.900
the last,

33:11.348 --> 33:18.855
You know, it's been a period of completely erasing 
a lot of the stuff that I had done. I've been

33:18.895 --> 33:25.622
involved with federal grants, been involved with 
regional council and regional planning for

33:18.895 --> 33:25.622
years. All of that stuff now is still up in budget 
planning. But I'm down in a policy development

33:29.566 --> 33:35.872
staff now, which is completely a different kind of 
shop. And I can talk about it more if you're

33:35.892 --> 33:38.674
interested. But... Bob Davis completely erased 
planning. It's strictly a budget staff up there.

33:47.064 --> 33:50.527
And I'm hopeful that things will change. Bob Davis 
just resigned this last week. And I'm hopeful that

33:53.970 --> 34:00.176
a new director might provide a little innovation 
and a new shape there. Are you recruiting? Well,

34:02.638 --> 34:08.423
are you interested?

34:08.503 --> 34:08.963
Bob. Bob would not be accepted in a Republican 
administration. You can take that, too. Let me

34:20.250 --> 34:37.448
talk with you now about the Department of 
Commerce, because I think if you had to be fair

34:20.250 --> 34:37.448
about the Clements administration now, I don't 
think the planning is really coming out of the

34:20.250 --> 34:37.448
budget and planning shop. I think our policies 
development staff is really more of a planning

34:38.238 --> 34:44.988
shop than the budget planning shop. But I'd have to 
point to the new Department of Commerce. This was a

34:49.275 --> 34:54.804
brainchild of Bill Clements. In his previous 
administration, he decided that we needed to

34:54.824 --> 35:06.642
gather together all the economic development 
kinds of functions in state government and merge

34:54.824 --> 35:06.642
them under one agency. The tourist industry shot 
it out of the water because the tourist

35:06.824 --> 35:17.800
development has a real strong lobbyist group all 
over the state. Tourism tends to be a publicity

35:18.601 --> 35:23.067
type folk. And so they can really mobilize their 
anti-program. And so it didn't work last term, but

35:31.079 --> 35:36.747
Bill Clements this time decided he was going to do 
it. They got Gib Lewis, the speaker, to support him

35:38.416 --> 35:43.121
and Hobby. And so they finally passed a piece of 
legislation this last session creating this new

35:43.141 --> 35:48.386
Department of Commerce. What's interesting 
about this whole shop, I mean, you've got the

35:49.307 --> 35:54.252
finance over here. That's the Community 
Development Block Grant. As you can tell, some of

35:58.076 --> 36:00.999
it's kind of faded out. But you've got a lot of the 
Job Training Partnership Act under here,

36:01.660 --> 36:06.565
tourism, business development, But up in the 
right hand upper corner, research and planning,

36:07.135 --> 36:16.589
they actually have a planning shop, a research and 
planning shop. And we'll talk a little bit more

36:17.470 --> 36:21.115
about that. But this office is a brand new office. 
We have a lot of one of those deals and a lot of

36:24.600 --> 36:28.887
expectations. We hope that a lot of good things 
will come from this. Now they've got considerable

36:33.545 --> 36:38.312
more financing than we've ever had before. And we 
feel like this is going to be a real positive move

36:39.133 --> 36:43.960
for us. Who did you say the executive director was? 
This one? Bill Lauterbach, who is a longtime

36:47.445 --> 36:52.913
friend of Clements. And the original idea of the 
head of that agency was supposed to be a corporate

36:53.975 --> 37:02.607
exec. but they were looking at a salary of about 
$70,000, and any kind of low-level corporate exec

37:03.616 --> 37:11.663
would be looking at a minimum of $150,000. So it's 
really difficult. You know how professors and

37:14.205 --> 37:23.434
corporate execs, about $150,000.

37:23.454 --> 37:32.982
But let me talk about this

37:23.454 --> 37:32.982
Strategic Economic Policy Commission.

37:44.825 --> 38:09.107
And I think in terms of planning the next three 
years, we're going to really need, as students,

37:44.825 --> 38:09.107
I'm sure you're not going to be around in the next 
three years, but whatever job you wind up landing

37:44.825 --> 38:09.107
in, you'll need to be watching this commission 
because I really think this is the grandson of the

37:44.825 --> 38:09.107
Texas 2000 Commission. That's what everybody 
said. What happened to the Texas 2000 Commission?

38:12.730 --> 38:14.612
We've got to have somebody looking ahead. 
planning for the future. Believe it or not, the

38:17.002 --> 38:22.208
legislation finally called on this commission to 
be formed. The governor is chairman.

38:26.953 --> 38:30.117
The lieutenant governor and speaker are on that 
commission. The governor's appointees are on

38:31.318 --> 38:38.626
there, as well as

38:31.318 --> 38:38.626
page two. There's an agenda that got stuck in the 
middle here. But on page two, you'll show

38:42.773 --> 38:45.116
appointees. You'll see the speaker and 
lieutenant governor has appointees.

38:52.004 --> 38:54.386
So it's a broad-based kind of a group. It's a 
bipartisan group. Hopefully, we'll keep the

38:56.549 --> 39:00.053
politics out of it. It will never happen. I mean, 
politics are in everything. But this is a very

39:02.876 --> 39:07.722
bipartisan group. This little packet, I won't... 
Won't belabor you with it, but it does lay out the

39:11.410 --> 39:18.317
mission of the commission, the mandates. It lays 
out sort of a general schedule of activities, kind

39:20.659 --> 39:40.978
of the paper flow process, shows how they plan to 
get their work done, scheduling public hearings

39:20.659 --> 39:40.978
in that, believe it or not, in that process.

39:42.562 --> 39:46.007
So it's something that you just need to look 
through. It may be of interest to you in some of your

39:46.047 --> 39:50.274
projects. I have high hopes that this group may be 
our real key for this next couple of years.

40:01.071 --> 40:10.746
In talking about state planning, just got to say 
that the way we're structured in Texas, we have

40:01.071 --> 40:10.746
over 300 state agencies. just no way that we could 
ever have a centralized planning function where,

40:11.722 --> 40:24.341
be it the governor or be it another single state 
agency, to do all the planning for all the

40:11.722 --> 40:24.341
agencies. So philosophically, if we can 
structure a planning function within each state

40:24.381 --> 40:39.163
government, develop it to the best possible 
planning function that we can do, and then there is

40:24.381 --> 40:39.163
a link-up of all that planning function where 
everybody knows what's going on and that those

40:39.363 --> 40:52.619
planning activities are cast in kind of a complete 
package. All the little functional single agency

40:53.120 --> 40:59.768
plans need to somehow be drawn together, sort of 
like the goals for Texas. That's what the phase two

41:00.569 --> 41:03.132
was. It was each state agency contributed to a 
overall package. But we still need the individual

41:08.557 --> 41:12.823
agency planning efforts. Each of our, this is the 
second to last point, each state agency,

41:12.843 --> 41:26.601
somewhere hidden down in the bowels of their state 
laws, it says that they're supposed to do some kind

41:12.843 --> 41:26.601
of planning activity. It's not emphasized, and as 
I told Bob coming in here, there are a lot of laws on

41:27.322 --> 41:34.231
the books that aren't implemented. So each of the 
agencies do do have individual little silent laws

41:37.092 --> 41:43.561
down in their statutory base. This old piece of 
work in 73 would point out all those little secret

41:45.003 --> 41:50.030
laws. But it probably needs to be updated since 
it's probably 13 years old. Bob, that might be a

41:56.379 --> 42:01.005
good project for you.

42:01.025 --> 42:02.447
No comment. OK, now the last thing that I want to 
just throw at you, and then I want to hear from you.

42:10.522 --> 42:25.961
A major part of the planning work that's done,

42:10.522 --> 42:25.961
probably fairly sketchy but still done, is the use 
of task forces. And I don't know. I mean, this is not

42:28.564 --> 42:32.449
my recap of those. But there are a number of them 
that Governor Clements has formed through

42:33.450 --> 42:37.575
executive order. And then the legislature 
directed that certain committees, task forces be

42:38.939 --> 42:45.746
formed. So you'll follow as you flip through. 
You've got to be really innovative to be able to

42:48.549 --> 42:52.994
read this. It's stapled in the wrong corner. But 
we've got a hog of a machine that staples it where it

42:55.476 --> 43:00.241
wants to staple it. And that's it. So you take it or 
leave it. But you'll flip. through, you can see

43:04.876 --> 43:09.822
everything from kind of an accounting. The top one 
we had was it was accounting auditing, financial

43:11.764 --> 43:28.142
group trying to every state agency has a different 
accounting system and a different procedure of

43:11.764 --> 43:28.142
keeping track of their expenditure. They do have 
to fit a mold a little bit of the comptroller. But if

43:31.686 --> 43:33.448
you'll look at the Yes. His Maggie. I wanted to 
point out that under water resources, there's no

43:35.747 --> 43:42.117
chairman, but they do have staff. And Ralph Baker 
was my graduate assistant when he was in the

43:42.137 --> 43:46.763
department here. Ralph is now in budget planning 
and is on a number of these task forces, as you flip

43:47.304 --> 43:55.676
through here. And would be a good contact on 
natural resource issues. He was hired away from

44:01.444 --> 44:02.946
the water. Resources Department. From Cthulhu. 
Cthulhu. Country boy. But...

44:09.724 --> 44:18.597
Jay Stanford, I see, is chairman of State 
Emergency Communications. Yeah, Jay Stanford is

44:18.637 --> 44:22.783
the director of the Texas Advisory Commission on 
Intergovernmental Relations. Been there for a

44:23.443 --> 44:24.665
number of years. But this is just to kind of give you 
a feel that a lot of the... planning, policy

44:32.356 --> 44:39.023
development kinds of activities come from a task 
force arrangement. I'd say most of those would be

44:40.144 --> 44:57.001
considered a short-term, four to six months, go 
in, rattle around, get as much facts as you can,

44:40.144 --> 44:57.001
determine what the problems are, and make a 
recommendation. Most of these will make a

44:58.327 --> 45:03.031
recommendation concerning how to fix something 
through legislation. So we will see a piece of

45:03.932 --> 45:09.057
legislation probably coming out of each of the 
task forces. Let me just kind of hear from you a

45:11.019 --> 45:15.864
minute or what interests you. Where are most of you 
going to go to work when you finish here?

45:23.991 --> 45:27.034
Are you Austin?

45:29.039 --> 45:31.382
Are most of you finishing up in May?

45:34.847 --> 45:34.907
No? Some months.

45:39.373 --> 45:45.322
If you had your model job right now, would you be 
looking for a city planner job? Show of hands. Show

45:46.924 --> 45:48.686
of hands. Maybe not, maybe so. How about county? 
Anybody involved in county? There's a Joe

45:54.735 --> 45:58.540
Gieselman still in Travis County. in Austin that 
was out of our program and has gone through

45:59.009 --> 46:05.317
reorganization. I'm not sure exactly how that's 
going to work out. He was in charge of

46:08.421 --> 46:10.624
transportation planning. But I think they've 
just recently reshaped it. He may be over some more

46:12.567 --> 46:18.274
stuff other than transportation now. Are most of 
you going to be looking at a functional planning

46:18.675 --> 46:23.681
like transportation or health? Or most of you 
looking for a generalist type job? Yes.

46:38.679 --> 46:39.220
What's your favorite? I mean, just looking at your 
job, what are you looking for? Do you know yet?

46:45.387 --> 46:46.348
They're looking for money. They're not looking 
for what I'm looking for. What are you looking for?

46:53.916 --> 46:57.780
A reservation plan.

46:57.800 --> 46:58.581
Well, let me just Let me just say something. I think 
most of you going through this curriculum would be

47:01.785 --> 47:13.380
looking for a city or a local government job,

47:01.785 --> 47:13.380
probably for a number of reasons. And I'll hit a 
couple. Number one, city jobs tend to be paid

47:15.223 --> 47:18.387
better. I think if you look at a city manager, 
deputy, something empty up, planning or

47:19.589 --> 47:30.323
whatever, those jobs at the top level very high 
compared to the state. I'm not sure that's true

47:35.490 --> 47:45.599
when you get down into the mid-management kind of 
stuff, but I've been really surprised at some of

47:35.490 --> 47:45.599
the city salary levels. It's been good. But I 
think, too, I think this department really

47:49.362 --> 47:53.266
teaches the city. It's easy to send you over to the 
city council here in Bryan College Station and

48:00.003 --> 48:01.806
understand how government works there. And I just 
would make a pitch to you that state government may

48:02.727 --> 48:13.744
not be easy to get jobs or whatever, but I would 
really encourage you to look at it. I didn't think

48:14.285 --> 48:17.190
state was where I was going to go. I wound up looking 
for jobs and just, you know.
