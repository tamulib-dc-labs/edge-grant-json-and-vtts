WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:07.197
David, not thinking, I would do those things.

00:07.637 --> 00:18.831
I was put in charge of distributing most of the money that was brought into the experiment station for new initiatives.

00:19.752 --> 00:30.865
Three people, Foden Maxwell, myself, and the head of biochemistry, Gene, I can't even think of his name right.

00:30.845 --> 00:49.495
But anyhow, we distributed all that money and we reviewed protocols and projects and I did all of that and set up the IBT and all those things kind of without George being involved.

00:50.791 --> 01:01.786
And as I look back on it, but he never complained and never said a word, and he just helped me if I needed something.

01:01.806 --> 01:04.615
Most deans would have had a heart attack.

01:05.388 --> 01:10.036
They had some buck running around doing all the things that I did.

01:10.056 --> 01:21.094
In fact, his wife used to say, tell George, he said, tell him that McCready's working you to death, George.

01:21.174 --> 01:25.000
He's supposed to be working for you.

01:24.980 --> 01:26.623
And I look back on it.

01:26.763 --> 01:28.246
I did all that, but I didn't do it.

01:28.787 --> 01:32.714
I wasn't trying to go above or anybody or anything.

01:32.734 --> 01:33.635
It was just fun.

01:33.776 --> 01:37.562
I mean, it was just because I was getting that money for our college.

01:37.843 --> 01:38.845
I felt good.

01:38.905 --> 01:45.216
I was getting so much Experiment Station money and giving it to our people over here.

01:45.196 --> 01:49.803
that I would think that George couldn't help but be happy about it, you know.

01:50.504 --> 01:58.657
But again, I should have been more in touch with him along the way.

02:04.085 --> 02:11.997
At the campus level, Dr. Miller served until 1980.

02:12.854 --> 02:15.822
then there's an interim president, Chuck Sampson.

02:16.664 --> 02:19.271
Any changes at that point?

02:21.115 --> 02:24.805
No, not really.

02:25.544 --> 02:55.551
I had developed a program in biomedical engineering back when I was setting up the medical program and all of that, and had brought some people in, Dan Hightower and Jim, I can't think of his name right now, and actually set up a biomedical engineering

02:55.531 --> 03:13.554
program, and we used part of the Teague Building, and of course, Benson, Dean Benson was head of engineering, and he always had a real interest in medicine, and so that all went together.

03:13.574 --> 03:22.626
In fact, he, based on that whole thing, he set up a PhD, or a doctorate of engineering.

03:22.646 --> 03:23.547
But

03:24.978 --> 03:29.364
We didn't really have anything to do with Sampson.

03:29.484 --> 03:39.457
I mean, he was, you know, General Ludeke and Sampson.

03:39.818 --> 03:51.053
Now, Ludeke fitted in real good, because on that biomedical engineering thing we had set up, he was, I'd used retired military people, and he was, of course, a general.

03:51.033 --> 04:02.110
Ludeke was probably more in tune with lots of things we were doing than anybody, but Sampson never, he seemed to be kind of removed from them.

04:02.831 --> 04:07.438
All right, then he is succeeded by Vandiver, who was appointed as president in 81.

04:10.202 --> 04:12.105
Did that have any effect on veterinary medicine?

04:12.326 --> 04:14.509
Well, yeah.

04:14.692 --> 04:23.805
In a way, Van Ver, whom you know well and I know, I was, when are you ready to cut this thing off?

04:24.807 --> 04:32.818
But anyhow, I was on the Presidential Search Committee to try to find somebody at that time.

04:33.423 --> 04:37.168
Our committee was divided up into two groups.

04:38.410 --> 04:52.528
George Mitchell had half of the group, and then Bum Bright had the other half, and we reviewed several hundred people for the presidency, and we had outside

04:52.508 --> 05:03.883
source consultant group to help us and we spent six or eight months on narrowing that down.

05:04.924 --> 05:14.196
We would work in two separate groups all morning and then we'd come together in the afternoon as one group and see where we were.

05:14.176 --> 05:17.180
and see how we reconciled each other.

05:17.260 --> 05:23.688
And we really worked on that very, very hard for a long, long time.

05:24.749 --> 05:33.199
And then unbeknowing to us, we get a call one day that Dr. Vandiver from North Texas State had been hired as president.

05:34.161 --> 05:39.407
He was never on our list, never looked at in any way.

05:39.387 --> 05:49.824
And we were told to turn in all of our notes and everything and that there was to be no comment made on how the President was selected.

05:50.225 --> 05:55.033
We can't finish.

05:55.013 --> 06:00.488
Okay, back to, I guess, the original question of what happened under Dr. Vannevar.

06:00.508 --> 06:10.255
Well, Dr. Vannevar came in, again, being on this search committee and spending lots of time, we were all shocked that

06:11.062 --> 06:19.373
Bob Bright had had lunch with Dr. Vandiver in Dallas one day and offered him the president of Texas A&M University.

06:20.595 --> 06:29.307
Well, when he got here, I served on so many committees in my life, but one of them was a committee on committees.

06:30.350 --> 06:33.474
where we were reviewing all the committees at Texas A&M.

06:34.175 --> 06:36.898
And another one was a committee on faculty governance.

06:38.720 --> 06:53.217
And being military and so forth, and I believed in line item, direct chain of command, and so forth, and was very happy with the academic council.

06:53.418 --> 06:57.943
And Dr. Vandiver came in and said, we're going to have a faculty senate.

06:59.358 --> 07:06.325
and turn it over to our committee to see what, how that could be accomplished.

07:06.345 --> 07:13.793
Well, I rednecked, opposed it, and fought it, and told those Ph.D.

07:14.554 --> 07:20.660
members that Highway 6 ran both ways, that we were doing quite well as a university.

07:20.740 --> 07:25.365
We did not need a bunch of faculty, and we had

07:25.345 --> 07:47.421
set up already a hybrid system where the Academic Council had adjunct members, one from every department, so that they could come to all the meetings and make their comments and inputs and all that, and it was functioning quite well.

07:47.401 --> 08:00.586
Well, it wasn't very long after that that Dr. Vandiver called me and wanted me to have lunch at his house, at the president's house.

08:00.606 --> 08:06.777
And he talked a long time about how we had to have a faculty senate

08:06.757 --> 08:21.631
I had been involved in getting Texas A&M University on probation with the American Association of University presidents or something, AAU or something, and through firing a faculty member and a few things.

08:21.671 --> 08:33.422
But anyhow, he said, we've got to get back, you know, on accreditation, and we've got to have a faculty senate, and we've got to do this, and we've got to do that.

08:34.263 --> 08:39.709
And I said, well, I just can't see it.

08:41.732 --> 08:48.460
I never worried about my position in life, and that probably was not good.

08:48.500 --> 08:54.187
But anyhow, he said, well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

08:54.207 --> 08:59.713
He said, I'm going to set a bicarmel form of government up here.

09:00.723 --> 09:03.368
And I said, well, explain to me what you mean.

09:03.508 --> 09:12.223
He said, well, I'm going to have a faculty-type group, and I'm going to keep the academic council.

09:12.243 --> 09:17.652
And we're going to work, I'm going to work with that group.

09:17.632 --> 09:26.405
Well, after they voted in a faculty senate, I think the academic council met once and never heard from it again.

09:27.807 --> 09:32.174
And so then the faculty senate took off and they'd done fairly well, I guess.

09:33.435 --> 09:44.652
And then later on, George Shelton and Dean Gage and

09:46.792 --> 09:55.128
The director of the, Walter Jewel.

09:55.929 --> 10:05.087
We went to see Vandiver one time, Dr. Vandiver one time, about setting up here the Food Safety and Inspection Service.

10:05.725 --> 10:09.874
And we went over, and he said, no.

10:10.074 --> 10:12.118
He said, we're not a technical school.

10:12.158 --> 10:14.082
We don't fool with that kind of stuff.

10:16.488 --> 10:20.756
And he said, I don't think we should make application for it.

10:22.139 --> 10:25.827
So on the way back, I told George, I said,

10:25.807 --> 10:36.664
You know, he's a historian type guy, and he might understand if we approach him from a standpoint of history.

10:36.684 --> 10:38.487
George says, well, what do you mean?

10:38.627 --> 10:53.991
I said, well, let's just go back to the beginning of veterinary medicine and the laws and bylaws in the state and the congressional records and everything else that brought veterinary medicine to the forefront.

10:55.422 --> 11:01.532
And it was all based on food safety from day one of veterinary medicine.

11:03.195 --> 11:12.250
And so George and I put together a paper, a brief, sent it back to Dr. Vandiver.

11:12.803 --> 11:22.437
And Dr. Vanner said, oh, I didn't know that y'all were that involved with meat inspection and all of that, animal, food animal.

11:23.839 --> 11:28.626
And he said, you can go ahead and make an application.

11:28.646 --> 11:33.073
And so now we're the nation's center for food safety.

11:35.777 --> 11:41.545
But it's just a matter of educational process, I guess.

11:41.525 --> 11:43.698
That ought to be enough today, don't you think?

11:44.020 --> 11:45.067
Are you saying you want to quit?

11:45.530 --> 11:46.174
Yeah, I'm tired.

11:46.194 --> 11:47.502
Okay.
