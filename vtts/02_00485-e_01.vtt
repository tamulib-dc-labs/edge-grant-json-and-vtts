WEBVTT

00:01.195 --> 00:04.520
Today is Friday the 29th of January, this is a test.

00:10.107 --> 00:29.194
Last time we were discussing the job that you had as 
Deputy Chief and then Chief of the Armed Forces

00:10.107 --> 00:29.194
Special Weapons Project and you were there from 
1951 until 1957

00:10.107 --> 00:29.194
and we were talking about some of the 
personalities, we were talking about LeMay is

00:29.545 --> 00:31.750
where we ended up. I'd like to talk right now about 
another personality that you must have known,

00:32.952 --> 00:42.353
Teller, Edward Teller, the so-called father of 
the H-bomb.

00:44.978 --> 00:49.849
What type of relationship did you have with him?

00:50.167 --> 00:54.732
A rather lengthy one and varied. I have a Christmas 
card over there that I got from Dr. and Mrs. Teller

00:55.713 --> 01:01.921
this Christmas.

01:06.766 --> 01:19.701
Dr. Teller, of course, was in the original group of 
scientists working on the A-bomb and was at Los

01:06.766 --> 01:19.701
Alamos. And after the

01:20.137 --> 01:37.686
war was over and we began—then the Atomic Energy 
Commission formed, and we established another

01:20.137 --> 01:37.686
laboratory at Livermore, California, and he was 
made director of that laboratory. And

01:37.826 --> 01:46.701
as such, worked with the commission on all of the 
things related to operating a laboratory, what

01:47.120 --> 02:03.815
research program they would have, what funds they 
would have, what budget, what kind of hiring

01:47.120 --> 02:03.815
policies, and all of the things that are involved 
in running an entity of that sort. And

02:05.717 --> 02:14.545
as a member of the Military Liaison Committee 
staff,

02:16.330 --> 02:32.469
And later in the Enforcer Special Weapons 
Project, we were interested in and had inputs to

02:16.330 --> 02:32.469
essentially

02:16.330 --> 02:32.469
all of the projects that either of the 
laboratories was doing. And so we had a continuous

02:32.509 --> 02:40.498
liaison with an officer there on the laboratory. 
us, and very frequent meetings and discussions

02:41.609 --> 02:52.408
with the personnel of the laboratory, including 
Teller. And so we probably sat down together once

02:52.428 --> 03:03.448
every two weeks to once every month for the full 
time that I was in the Armed Forces Special Weapons

03:05.183 --> 03:09.530
Project. I worked with them on the research 
program for weapons, the testing program, the

03:10.892 --> 03:32.406
weapons effects program,

03:10.892 --> 03:32.406
their research programs into other areas of 
military interest,

03:10.892 --> 03:32.406
testing problems.

03:35.052 --> 03:46.247
Well, just about anything you can think of in 
connection with the nuclear weapons field,

03:35.052 --> 03:46.247
nuclear weapons and nuclear propulsion field. 
And during this period of time, work also began,

03:46.267 --> 03:58.324
research work on the fusion field for power.

03:58.344 --> 04:01.228
And of course, it continued in the weapons field.

04:05.647 --> 04:29.460
And this relationship of course was closer still 
when I took his weapons to the Pacific to test them

04:05.647 --> 04:29.460
and his laboratory personnel and even more so when 
I came back from that and took over as general

04:05.647 --> 04:29.460
manager of AEC and was therefore headed the entity 
to which he submitted all his plans and programs

04:31.482 --> 04:40.094
and budget requirements and other things. So 
worked very closely with him there until I

04:40.114 --> 04:52.330
left there at the end of six years to go to the Jet 
Propulsion Lab. And while I saw him several times

04:53.251 --> 05:00.561
after that, including a couple of times here at 
Texas A&M, I've

05:01.807 --> 05:13.780
not been working with him because he's still in 
that business and I'm in some other business. What

05:13.800 --> 05:14.941
was your opinion of him?

05:18.165 --> 05:20.868
I said the same thing, I guess, about a good many 
people. He was a wonderful, wonderful man,

05:20.928 --> 05:26.594
wonderful person.

05:26.614 --> 05:30.598
I have very deepest respect for him. and for his 
capabilities, as well as his qualities as a human

05:31.692 --> 05:39.223
being and as a man.

05:42.969 --> 05:46.675
He's considerate, compassionate.

05:49.159 --> 06:00.636
He believes strongly, and he makes his case 
strongly, and sticks to it, and usually wins. One

06:01.645 --> 06:09.500
of the major issues was the disagreement between 
Oppenheimer and Teller on the development of the

06:01.645 --> 06:09.500
H-bomb. Would you like to comment on that? To the 
extent to recognize that one was on one side of the

06:12.887 --> 06:20.582
fence and one on the other,

06:21.338 --> 06:26.703
arguments would be what one, bring out the points 
that one would expect. Needless to say, I was in

06:27.844 --> 06:37.833
full agreement with Teller and not in agreement 
with Oppenheimer, so it wasn't hard to determine

06:27.844 --> 06:37.833
where my sympathies were. Some people have 
charged, and it might be an unfair charge, that

06:38.393 --> 06:48.983
Teller was influential in congressional 
hearings. in persuading the government to take

06:49.283 --> 06:54.909
Oppenheimer's security clearance away? I have no 
personal knowledge of this, but I do not believe

06:56.931 --> 07:04.458
it's so.

07:11.025 --> 07:14.429
I can't speak from personal knowledge, but I do not 
believe it's true. What impact did the

07:15.069 --> 07:18.733
development of the H-bomb have on the Armed Forces 
Special Weapons Project? Well, it broadened our

07:22.998 --> 07:30.767
approach. I mean, all of the functions that we had 
to perform, we had to now expand by orders of

07:31.027 --> 07:47.067
magnitude in terms of the increased power that we 
would expect from this development. One of the

07:48.481 --> 08:01.600
roughest things that happened to us was 
propelling us immediately into the, beyond the

07:48.481 --> 08:01.600
technology available in cryogenics.

08:04.785 --> 08:10.253
Because in the early approach to the H-bomb,

08:11.684 --> 08:16.873
everything had to be done close to absolute zero 
temperature. And this is a very costly and

08:18.276 --> 08:27.812
extremely difficult problem. And we, as other 
development agencies, were involved heavily. as

08:36.001 --> 08:46.333
we went down the road, we found a way to get around 
this and could abandon that approach. I have a

08:46.353 --> 08:58.667
notion that the United States learned more about 
the physics and chemistry of low temperatures in a

08:46.353 --> 08:58.667
couple of years than they probably learned in all 
the rest of history. Besides the development of

08:59.727 --> 09:07.137
the H-bomb, there were other new weapons that were 
developed in the 1950s. Would you comment on those

09:08.920 --> 09:13.226
special projects that you people worked on? Well, 
one has to be very careful here of security. I've

09:21.678 --> 09:25.583
been out of the process now for a number of years. I 
don't know all of the things that have been

09:26.339 --> 09:31.906
classified or declassified.

09:35.570 --> 09:54.152
But one of our primary objectives was to get the 
explosive power up and the weight down such that

09:35.570 --> 09:54.152
they could be handled

09:35.570 --> 09:54.152
in our intercontinental ballistic missiles and 
other applications. Because the penalty and

09:55.364 --> 10:05.717
delivery systems that one pays for heavy weight is 
very great indeed. So a pound off of the portion to

10:07.560 --> 10:24.882
be delivered sometimes is 100 pounds or more off of 
the total weight of what one has to launch or move.

10:27.578 --> 10:30.703
And so that was one of the big objectives. The 
other, of course, is getting any of the weapons so

10:31.824 --> 10:57.282
that they have a long life

10:31.824 --> 10:57.282
in storage or in inactive status, because you 
certainly hope that's the way they're going to

10:31.824 --> 10:57.282
stay, and to be absolutely sure on all aspects of 
safety. And so, very much of the energy went into

11:04.469 --> 11:11.859
this area. The other major area of effort was that 
of determining weapons of fact, of various kinds

11:24.430 --> 11:28.136
and magnitudes of detonations. And

11:29.819 --> 11:37.993
our agency was the one charged fully with that 
responsibility. So much of our energy was there.

11:41.599 --> 11:48.430
And of course, this took the cooperation of the 
laboratories, the development people, the

11:41.599 --> 11:48.430
researchers.

11:49.878 --> 11:54.767
everyone in the business in order to pin down the 
effects. So, we could summarize by saying that

11:56.290 --> 12:05.627
your mission then was dealt with reducing weight, 
longevity, safety, and the effects. And

12:05.648 --> 12:06.750
deliverability, yeah. And the deliverability. 
Okay.

12:13.435 --> 12:36.945
now concerning the effects and this is we were 
talking before about this and this is very

12:13.435 --> 12:36.945
important it's been in the news recently uh you've 
been at uh as far as you know more atomic blasts than

12:13.435 --> 12:36.945
any other human at one time okay i'm not 
necessarily true now yes and uh i'd like to I'd like

12:37.364 --> 12:43.010
you to tell me about some of the early testing and 
some of the findings. You know, things of course

12:43.351 --> 12:47.755
that are not classified, but some of the findings. 
What were you looking for, and what did you find,

12:47.795 --> 12:54.202
and did you expect to find the things that you were 
looking for? In the effects area, and I think you

12:54.222 --> 13:02.311
were talking effects rather than development.

13:04.193 --> 13:05.835
In the effects area, I don't think we really found 
any surprises. If we did, they were surprises on

13:11.804 --> 13:21.638
the safe side rather than on the horror side.

13:26.445 --> 13:31.131
If you remember earlier all of the talk of 
sterility resulting from exposure of just almost

13:31.988 --> 13:38.475
any amount. And everyone was scared.

13:43.500 --> 14:01.860
We found, I think, as we should have expected to 
find, that yes, it can create sterility if the dose

13:43.500 --> 14:01.860
is high enough and sustained long enough, the same 
as can x-ray or exposures to a bit many other

13:43.500 --> 14:01.860
things.

14:06.076 --> 14:22.652
The argument is still, of course, going on heavily 
as to the results of the effects of exposure to

14:06.076 --> 14:22.652
low-level radiation over long periods of time, 
particularly. And I don't think that anyone's

14:24.213 --> 14:34.463
going to know all the answers to that for a good many 
years yet.

14:35.388 --> 14:49.523
from the work that we did, we were convinced that 
this effect was very minimal, and in some cases

14:35.388 --> 14:49.523
even beneficial. And if the exposure was not 
sufficiently rapid that your body couldn't take

14:51.365 --> 15:03.859
care of it, that it did in fact get busy to repair 
much of the uh, damage that is done by the

15:04.463 --> 15:07.848
radiation.

15:10.632 --> 15:33.407
And so we think that the fear of it

15:10.632 --> 15:33.407
is a very much more dangerous effect than the 
effect of the radiation itself, except in direct

15:10.632 --> 15:33.407
exposure to, uh, either to explosions, I mean 
direct exposure, direct exposure to explosion,

15:34.028 --> 15:49.830
or direct exposure to hard radiation from 
reactors or power-producing reactions.

15:49.850 --> 16:03.529
With respect to the other effects, particularly 
blast,

15:49.850 --> 16:03.529
as soon as one knows the characteristic of the 
blast wave, computation

16:04.893 --> 16:19.534
can then

16:04.893 --> 16:19.534
come very close to determining the effect of any 
particular blast on any particular plate or

16:04.893 --> 16:19.534
point.

16:26.243 --> 16:29.828
So there's nothing really mysterious about that 
one. The explosion has a blast wave and blast

16:34.846 --> 16:49.851
effects that are quite different from dynamite or 
TNT or some other explosive, but they are alike

16:34.846 --> 16:49.851
within themselves. I mean, a nuclear detonation 
is a nuclear detonation, and its blast wave has

16:51.634 --> 16:58.626
certain characteristics, and it'll be the same 
yesterday as tomorrow. So that one, though taking

17:00.985 --> 17:11.916
a very great deal of work to pin down, is not subject 
to particular controversy or further

17:00.985 --> 17:11.916
difficulty.

17:17.742 --> 17:29.254
And so far as the danger from radiation is 
concerned, it is very much overdone, except what

17:17.742 --> 17:29.254
might result from direct exposure to a nuclear 
detonation, such as you would have in war, such as

17:30.179 --> 17:39.411
you had at Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

17:41.634 --> 17:59.258
That one, in my view, is blown out of proportion, 
too, because the people who were directly exposed

17:41.634 --> 17:59.258
either were killed, or if they survived, the 
effects were certainly observable. We

18:00.385 --> 18:15.744
have been following every family that was over 
there that

18:00.385 --> 18:15.744
were within certain ranges of the explosion, or 
even said they were in there.

18:20.210 --> 18:27.439
And I think we haven't learned a great deal about 
anything, in fact, from that. Well, you know, when

18:27.976 --> 18:37.151
you open up a newspaper or a magazine, often you see 
articles dealing with, well, the 60 Minutes. You

18:37.551 --> 18:40.416
probably saw 60 Minutes a couple of years ago. I 
think Mike Wallace had the program in which he

18:40.516 --> 18:49.731
interviewed some veterans who had been at some of 
the 1950 blasts out in Oh Tim, Nevada, and you know,

18:50.302 --> 19:01.675
it was played up like the American government were 
using its soldiers as getting pigs, and now these

18:50.302 --> 19:01.675
people have a higher incident rate of cancer, 
genetic problems. What's your response to those

19:02.095 --> 19:04.378
charges? It's a bunch of baloney. For my money, 
it's complete baloney. They didn't get enough

19:11.526 --> 19:17.693
exposure out of their participation in Nevada. to 
change anything that was going to happen to them as

19:18.601 --> 19:24.589
far as I'm concerned. And most of their troubles, I 
think, are imaginary with a

19:24.609 --> 19:39.390
vision somewhere in their mind of Uncle Sam taking 
care of them from now on. And I've got no truck with

19:39.410 --> 19:43.796
any of them. I don't think there's anything

19:43.816 --> 19:48.523
to it at all. And did the Armed Forces Special 
Weapons Project or when you were in charge of the

19:48.790 --> 20:02.901
AEC, did they carry out their own investigation of 
these charges? Well, of course these charges

20:03.556 --> 20:08.803
didn't arise until very recently. The AEC at the 
time, and the Armed Forces Special Weapons

20:09.364 --> 20:32.196
Project at the time, and the Army at the time for 
that matter, tabulated all of the exposures, and

20:09.364 --> 20:32.196
all these people had film badges, and they were 
turned in, and everything was tracked as well as it

20:09.364 --> 20:32.196
could be tracked at that time. And whether there 
were any individual overexposures,

20:32.463 --> 20:46.762
overexposures being something beyond what the 
limits had been set for the exercise,

20:32.463 --> 20:46.762
I don't know. I didn't hear any. But if so, there 
were damn few. And they weren't the people that

20:51.268 --> 20:58.078
Mike Wallace was talking

20:51.268 --> 20:58.078
to. Now, during the 1950s, there were a couple 
hundred above ground explosions? Is that about an

21:06.739 --> 21:10.805
approximate number, about two hundred were 
there? That may be a little high, perhaps a hundred

21:10.825 --> 21:14.751
fifty, something like that. I could count them, 
but it would take a while. Okay, now today of course

21:18.896 --> 21:27.128
we have a strong environmentalist lobby, and we 
don't have above ground testing anymore. The

21:28.570 --> 21:29.892
question is, Some people have said, why did the 
government have to carry out so many tests? What

21:35.516 --> 21:36.957
would your response be? There are about three 
reasons, I think. First, I think that

21:43.063 --> 21:59.558
knowledgeable people, in terms of our security, 
would agree that

21:43.063 --> 21:59.558
it was in our best interest to get on with the 
development of nuclear weapons and getting them

22:00.449 --> 22:04.015
into the stockpile in usable form.

22:07.300 --> 22:25.668
If one did agree to this, starting from where we 
were,

22:07.300 --> 22:25.668
with one test and two detonations

22:07.300 --> 22:25.668
on the enemy, that's not much background. No, not 
much knowledge. And so we had to move.

22:35.989 --> 22:39.232
We had a long, long ways to go. Those first devices, 
I'd hate to hesitate to call them weapons, were

22:39.272 --> 22:52.003
very heavy, clumsy devices. We couldn't have 
built a national defense based on that kind of a

22:57.993 --> 23:02.840
piece of mechanism.

23:04.263 --> 23:19.426
So we not only had to develop the physics and 
nucleonics of nuclear weapons, we had to develop

23:04.263 --> 23:19.426
the hardware and the deliverability and the 
safety and all these various things. Now, they

23:20.327 --> 23:24.253
say, could you have tested them below ground? 
Well, in retrospect, yes, we could have, except we

23:25.735 --> 23:34.945
didn't know enough about it at that point to know 
whether we could or not. That is a research project

23:35.766 --> 23:40.492
that takes a little time also. So while we were 
testing below ground, we were also testing below

23:43.014 --> 23:52.325
ground and developing the techniques for testing 
below ground. How one instruments at a thousand or

23:54.625 --> 24:07.737
two thousand feet below the surface is a pretty 
rough problem by itself.

24:07.757 --> 24:23.451
It probably costs something like one-tenth as 
much to test above ground as it does below ground.

24:24.410 --> 24:29.496
Some effects would have to be determined above 
ground. They just could not be determined below

24:29.516 --> 24:32.779
ground. As an example, what effect does a 
high-altitude explosion have on the ionosphere?

24:39.947 --> 24:46.114
You'll never find out the answer to that testing 
2,000, 3,000 feet below the surface. So some

24:46.134 --> 24:51.480
things had to be done in the air.

24:54.650 --> 24:58.855
I think those were all adequate reasons for the 
things that we did. We took quite extreme

24:59.856 --> 25:13.593
precautions in terms of

24:59.856 --> 25:13.593
safety from fallout and contamination.

25:13.733 --> 25:23.965
It's true that there were some times when the 
weather didn't act just exactly as we had

25:13.733 --> 25:23.965
projected. was a little fallout dropped 
off-site. But in nearly all cases, that's been

25:28.060 --> 25:42.101
blown up by the press,

25:28.060 --> 25:42.101
and the actual damage from it is either negligible 
or not at all.

25:47.048 --> 25:52.416
Now, as far as the development of the bomb itself, 
have To my knowledge, we have never dropped two

25:52.868 --> 25:59.094
atomic bombs close by simultaneously. Is that 
true?

26:03.038 --> 26:06.501
Never detonated two of them close together? 
Within a mile or two apart from each other. Well, I

26:10.705 --> 26:12.447
hadn't thought about it. Let me see.

26:16.331 --> 26:22.757
Because this is important, of course, for the MIRV 
and the multi-warheads that we have today. If we

26:23.024 --> 26:37.100
could think just hypothetically, what would 
happen if two or three or four bombs hit a city in one

26:23.024 --> 26:37.100
area just a few miles apart? Do we know? We 
certainly could calculate.

26:45.629 --> 26:47.592
I think the answer is yes, we know. We don't know 
from experience. There's a difference. But it

26:51.458 --> 26:54.943
would not be difficult to calculate. All one would 
need is the conditions under which the four

26:55.944 --> 27:00.490
detonations went off. I mean, by that location, 
altitude, and size of the individual detonation.

27:11.245 --> 27:14.850
The rest of it could be calculated pretty easily. 
And I'm sure it has been. I haven't done it, but I'm

27:17.113 --> 27:19.139
sure it has been. But as far as you know, we've never 
done a multiple explosion. No, as a practical

27:23.492 --> 27:26.601
matter, we haven't. I don't know of anything in 
particular to be gained by it. There's no mystery

27:31.300 --> 27:35.189
about it as far as I know. Okay, well what about the 
idea that if you have one explosion with a

27:35.229 --> 27:48.702
shockwave moving out and then a couple miles away 
you have another one, what's going to happen when

27:35.229 --> 27:48.702
those shockwaves hit, or three or four of those hit 
at the same time? I mean, I'm a novice, but that to me

27:49.643 --> 27:55.973
is somewhat of a mystery, and I was wondering— 
Well, it's not a mystery. It will create a

27:56.234 --> 28:05.509
different kind of devastation along this area 
where the shock waves meet.

28:06.248 --> 28:12.936
some more severe, some less severe, depending 
upon the conditions. But again, that can be

28:13.016 --> 28:22.348
plotted and calculated, and it's not mysterious. 
Okay, okay. Now away from fiction and toward fact,

28:24.190 --> 28:29.016
and that is the test-ban treaty. which was a fact, 
and signed between Kennedy and Khrushchev in

28:29.671 --> 28:44.093
1963, which meant that the United States now would 
go underground with testing. Were you for or

28:45.334 --> 28:46.536
against that? Well,

28:47.518 --> 28:55.830
the treaty that was signed

28:57.262 --> 28:58.623
I was against. I have to qualify that. I

29:02.227 --> 29:11.255
felt that we should have had a better treaty before 
we committed ourselves that far.

29:16.060 --> 29:26.610
If one takes the position, well that's the best 
treaty you can get, which I think the President did

29:16.060 --> 29:26.610
take that position, or recognized that as a 
condition. Then yes, I would have gone ahead and

29:28.852 --> 29:43.269
signed it, because there was just too much testing 
and there were going to be more, and we were getting

29:28.852 --> 29:43.269
into a bad situation. This could slow down 
development in countries who had not devoted as

29:44.270 --> 29:56.445
much effort as we had to underground testing. I 
think by that time we were fairly sophisticated in

29:57.016 --> 30:01.740
what we could do underground. And we had done 
enough in the atmosphere that we knew the

30:02.721 --> 30:13.571
parameters, at least, of the effects that we would 
get in the atmosphere. So there were nothing, no

30:14.572 --> 30:20.237
areas that, about which we knew nothing. There 
were areas in which we would have liked to have

30:20.618 --> 30:24.441
known some more. we had at least some knowledge 
about them and could go underground and go ahead

30:24.843 --> 30:32.714
with the development.

30:33.556 --> 30:39.925
My reason for being against the treaty was the same 
as it is now. If we have to give away our birthright

30:41.387 --> 30:51.982
in order to get those guys to agree to sign a treaty 
with us, then no treaty as far as I'm concerned.

30:52.082 --> 30:54.546
What do you mean by that, give away our birthright? 
Well, give them all the advantages and we kind of

30:54.914 --> 31:01.143
unilaterally go ahead and make ourselves nude. I 
don't buy that in weapons testing or armament or

31:01.164 --> 31:07.513
any other area. And

31:08.575 --> 31:23.217
if you have no way of verifying, they have no way of 
inspection, you can't believe the information

31:08.575 --> 31:23.217
that you do get, uh, then I think you're just kind of 
standing around naked and waiting for, to get

31:23.703 --> 31:31.614
clobbered. And I don't buy that. I recognize that 
sometimes they have to go further than they want to

31:35.419 --> 31:40.306
in that direction. And I think the President did 
that in the case of our test ban.

31:47.976 --> 31:52.022
Whether it was a justified thing, I'm sure will 
take, uh, a lot more years than I'm going to live to

31:52.222 --> 31:55.826
determine. Did you express your views to 
President Kennedy on this? Well, to the extent

32:02.032 --> 32:09.400
that anyone could, because you have, of course, 
regular mechanisms for that. And my position

32:11.842 --> 32:19.630
there, I was on several working groups, and I had my 
people on several working groups that worked

32:20.588 --> 32:26.994
daily with the ACDA and others in developing U.S. 
positions and putting our input. And I've pointed

32:28.435 --> 32:32.819
all these things out. And many times when you're in

32:34.701 --> 32:44.189
government, in our government, in these 
countries, you're not asked for a

32:34.701 --> 32:44.189
recommendation. You're asked for evaluations 
and factual analyses. And this is proper. I mean,

32:53.740 --> 32:58.407
there's nothing wrong with that. But that was 
mainly the area where I was and where my people was

32:58.427 --> 33:06.679
in that particular problem. And we did that to the 
very best of our ability, and I think it was good

33:07.600 --> 33:14.991
because we had some very capable people. Okay. 
Now, when the test ban treaty was You were with the

33:17.980 --> 33:21.744
Atomic Energy Commission. Yes, I was their 
manager. What impact did it have on the AEC, and did

33:24.987 --> 33:36.358
you have any friends back at the Armed Forces 
Special Weapons Project that could tell you what

33:24.987 --> 33:36.358
impact it had on them? Well, yes, we worked with 
them constantly, and the impact on them would have

33:37.739 --> 33:47.008
been the same as it was on us, as a matter of fact.

33:48.997 --> 34:02.272
It

33:48.997 --> 34:02.272
had the effect of slowing down our development 
program and making it much more costly.

34:07.338 --> 34:11.643
I guess there were some lesser effects, but those 
are the two main things that it did.

34:14.907 --> 34:17.029
Another thing I was interested in was those early 
tests, like Bikini and some of the other ones, do

34:18.545 --> 34:32.580
you remember what your first impressions were 
when you saw your first nuclear explosion or

34:18.545 --> 34:32.580
atomic explosion? Yes. I was on one

34:36.324 --> 34:47.235
of our communications ships—I've forgotten the 
name of it now—in Bikini or just out of Bikini

34:48.194 --> 34:49.876
Lagoon. When the shot was fired, it was one drop 
from an airplane and one off at two thousand feet

34:51.278 --> 35:00.269
about.

35:03.272 --> 35:07.137
Maybe not quite that high, I've forgotten 
exactly, but it was an air burst anyway. And it was

35:09.260 --> 35:16.969
my first view of a chain reaction of a nuclear 
detonation, a nuclear explosion.

35:21.387 --> 35:49.048
and the suddenness and the magnitudes

35:21.387 --> 35:49.048
and the disruption

35:21.387 --> 35:49.048
that was caused by it, all within milliseconds, 
was something that's a little difficult for your

35:21.387 --> 35:49.048
mind to follow unless you've had some practice, 
and I had no practice at that point. And of course,

35:51.104 --> 36:20.757
in the South Pacific, with the very, very moist 
air, with the shock wave ballooning out from the

35:51.104 --> 36:20.757
explosion, and it formed a

35:51.104 --> 36:20.757
dense cloud in the form of a diving bell with the 
bottom on the surface of the water that gradually

35:51.104 --> 36:20.757
expanded and went out. this

36:21.580 --> 36:39.142
huge explosion with all of its colors and boiling 
and disruption was suddenly closed in this diving

36:21.580 --> 36:39.142
bell of clouds. And almost equally quickly, that 
was dispersed by the heat. And so it was a very

36:46.331 --> 36:50.136
spectacular show.

36:51.500 --> 37:16.377
if you were thinking in terms of being on target

36:51.500 --> 37:16.377
and comparing that with

36:51.500 --> 37:16.377
being on target against other weapons that we had 
just finished a war using.

37:20.491 --> 37:26.540
made your mind stop working for a little bit to do 
some thinking, because you could not see how

37:20.491 --> 37:26.540
anything could survive. And

37:26.600 --> 37:41.603
even under a bomb barrage in World War II, you could 
visualize that if you were under the right covert

37:26.600 --> 37:41.603
or someplace, there was a chance you could get by. 
But your mind told you that there was no chance

37:42.424 --> 37:44.907
there. Actually, that doesn't turn out to be 
correct, but almost. So it was,

37:51.338 --> 37:59.667
well, it's a highly emotional scene, the first one 
you see. You

37:59.768 --> 38:20.451
think of the forces of nature that you didn't know 
about, and how great they are, or what great

37:59.768 --> 38:20.451
magnitude they are. It shakes

38:21.798 --> 38:30.510
you a bit.

38:30.530 --> 38:37.178
Did you change over time when you saw more and more 
of these?

38:40.022 --> 38:40.944
No, I didn't. It grew.

38:45.288 --> 38:54.497
Because that explosion I think was around twenty 
megatons as I remember, more or less that anyhow. I

38:54.517 --> 38:57.660
mean twenty kilotons.

38:58.621 --> 39:09.152
I went on to see explosions of many megatons under 
various circumstances.

39:09.172 --> 39:15.058
And that first flash is always the same. It's just 
bigger and more telling on your mind.

39:27.194 --> 39:31.819
There were British advisors at that test, weren't 
there? There were. British, not advisors, but

39:32.980 --> 39:36.885
witnesses at that test? Yes, there were. French, 
too? Yes, there were, well there were several,

39:38.687 --> 39:44.174
many foreign countries there. Were the Russians 
invited? Yes, Russian was right on board my ship.

39:48.894 --> 39:52.778
He was standing on deck with me when we watched it go 
up. What was his comment? Not so big. Not so big?

39:57.383 --> 39:57.803
That's what he said? That's all he said. Not so big.

40:07.394 --> 40:08.475
Not so big. Some people have contended that we 
invited the Russians to this to make sure that They

40:16.328 --> 40:22.558
saw what would happen to them if they didn't come to 
some post-war agreements with us. I can't answer

40:24.161 --> 40:27.487
that. I don't know why they were invited. Of 
course, the Russians were not the only ones. There

40:31.273 --> 40:32.515
were a lot of others.

40:40.325 --> 40:48.692
So

40:40.325 --> 40:48.692
I can't answer that. I was in the Joint Staff and 
relatively new at it at that time, so I don't know

40:48.732 --> 40:57.400
what the rationale was. Okay. I'd like to know 
about

40:59.382 --> 41:05.687
selling atomic energy. During the 1950s, the 
government carried out a

41:09.772 --> 41:30.478
campaign, basically, and a lot of companies did, 
an attempt to convince the American public that

41:09.772 --> 41:30.478
atomic energy was not only safe, but it might 
resolve a number of the questions like power and

41:09.772 --> 41:30.478
energy. And I was wondering if at the Special 
Weapons Project or at the AEC, if you were in any way

41:33.869 --> 41:42.022
involved with some of those campaigns? Yes, not at 
the Special Weapons Project, because we were

41:43.564 --> 41:54.842
concerned solely with weapons and power reactors 
for military purposes.

41:59.249 --> 42:00.872
But in AEC, And as general manager, well, yes, I was 
deeply involved in all of those campaigns. Not so

42:08.034 --> 42:10.858
much in trying to sell someone something. Our job, 
the whole purpose of creating the Atomic Energy

42:13.381 --> 42:28.682
Commission was to provide a means of developing 
atomic energy from its early status there. to

42:29.506 --> 42:32.390
peaceful applications for MADCON. All of us 
firmly believed that it had the capacity for that

42:33.832 --> 42:41.163
application and for achieving that goal. And we 
spent a lot of taxpayers' dollars to get there. And

42:49.255 --> 42:56.425
what we really were doing was defending our 
actions in developing the nuclear energy for

42:57.181 --> 43:03.487
peaceful purposes. And we're not consciously on a 
campaign to sell it, except to convince people,

43:04.588 --> 43:25.129
particularly Congress, that we were on the right 
track in development in the best interest of the

43:04.588 --> 43:25.129
United States. And in spite of the fact that 
nuclear energy has taken a tremendous back step, I

43:25.598 --> 43:36.071
still think that we were right at that time. And if 
we had continued to have support as we did, well,

43:37.353 --> 43:50.509
during the time that I was there and before that,

43:37.353 --> 43:50.509
half of the Power in the United States would not be 
coming from nuclear energy, and it would be half

43:50.725 --> 43:57.854
the price it is right now. And many, many other 
applications, too.

44:05.664 --> 44:18.960
The fact that people's hands have been tied in

44:05.664 --> 44:18.960
the development of the peaceful applications of 
nuclear energy, particularly in power, to me is a

44:19.092 --> 44:29.807
crime against the United States that is 
unforgivable.

44:35.755 --> 44:44.988
It demonstrates to me a gullibility of some of our 
people that makes me sick. Well, what about the

44:45.008 --> 44:46.770
argument course that many opponents of nuclear 
energy say in contemporary America, and that is

44:47.189 --> 44:56.741
that they point to Three Mile Island. They point to 
Three Mile Island and the accident we had there a

44:58.223 --> 45:02.488
couple of years ago. What's bad about Three Mile 
Island? I'm just asking you. Well, I'm telling

45:07.595 --> 45:08.636
you. I mean, I'm saying that this would be the 
question, I think, to somebody who points to Three

45:08.937 --> 45:16.386
Mile Island. you tell me what happened at Three 
Mile Island that was bad. So far as I can find, not a

45:20.709 --> 45:23.313
damn thing. The only thing that was bad about Three 
Mile Island is that some people got out among the

45:24.455 --> 45:43.943
populace who lived close by, whipped them up to a 
fever pitch, and got them going all about nothing,

45:24.455 --> 45:43.943
and caused a hell of a big problem.
