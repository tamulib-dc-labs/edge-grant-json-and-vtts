A big gift to Texas A&M. What would you want it to be 
for?

00:12.143 --> 00:15.707
Not because my wife is a librarian, but the 
library. Library. I'm on your side there. I recall

00:20.073 --> 00:28.563
when they were busing students to Austin to use the 
facilities over there at the University of Texas.

00:29.184 --> 00:30.105
Why? Why can't we have one like it? And she's 
gung-ho on having a decent, well-equipped

00:32.874 --> 00:38.882
library. And the library's going to help the 
student learn and get better educated, and you've

00:39.783 --> 00:48.755
got it right here. And so enlarge the library. 
That's what I'll do. Last question. What feelings

00:55.023 --> 00:59.248
do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M? Oh,

01:00.072 --> 01:14.529
I just love A&M, and for all that it is, all that it 
has been, for all that it is. And one thing is, I

01:15.410 --> 01:29.927
heard this, and I believe it, it says A&M has the 
facilities, all facilities for drilling for oil.

01:30.768 --> 01:33.657
We don't have anybody there that can sell it. He 
says, we need somebody that can negotiate and get

01:35.402 --> 01:42.904
oil and get the abilities

01:43.188 --> 01:57.669
to find the places to drill, so that the United 
States of America can have all the oil that it

01:43.188 --> 01:57.669
needs. As you know yourself, we're getting oil 
from someplace else to save what we've got here

01:57.949 --> 02:05.720
now, and it's being capped. And there is a place 
down in sort of south Texas that there is oil

02:11.504 --> 02:19.735
underneath there, lots of it, but nobody wants to 
say anything about it, and they want to keep it in

02:11.504 --> 02:19.735
reserve. They say, let's buy what oil we need and 
let it deplete over there, and we won't. So we

02:27.025 --> 02:36.718
have this, it needs to have, I don't know if they 
have it already, but that you already have the

02:37.390 --> 02:42.377
expertise and the know-how of how to drill. Now we 
need somebody that can go higher and be able to

02:44.280 --> 02:56.699
negotiate with the government and those people 
that control the oil wealth. And once we do that,

02:57.920 --> 03:01.966
then we'll be right on top. Yes, sir.
