WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:08.008
was such that it only met next year's requirement for officers.

00:08.248 --> 00:12.334
It didn't look at National Guard and Reserve requirements.

00:12.935 --> 00:25.593
Where the Army over here was expanding their Guard and Reserve components considerably, and they had a program where you could actually end up commissioning and going into the Guard or Reserve.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.896
So it wasn't just an active duty program.

00:28.257 --> 00:31.962
But that allowed the Army to commission more than

00:32.482 --> 00:34.464
Their fair share, I would say.

00:35.765 --> 00:37.067
But the Army program grew.

00:37.147 --> 00:47.797
I think the leadership we had in the Army program took advantage of some of the options, and the Army program did grow.

00:47.998 --> 00:49.679
What about the Navy and Marine program?

00:49.699 --> 00:51.341
The Navy and Marine program?

00:56.506 --> 00:57.527
I don't recall...

00:58.621 --> 01:02.386
any real significant change in the size of that program.

01:03.007 --> 01:10.396
It was the smaller of the three, and I would say today it's still the smaller of the three programs here.

01:10.896 --> 01:27.177
If we were to poll the Corps members during those years, would there have been, other than their own service, would there have been one that they would have thought was the best and one that was the weakest?

01:27.460 --> 01:28.581
if we had had a poll?

01:30.343 --> 01:32.945
I'm not sure how that poll would have come out.

01:35.027 --> 01:46.517
I think, General, one thing that helped the Army program, they tended to focus more on the challenge and rigor of the program.

01:50.261 --> 01:53.984
The Air Force program was seen a little soft, I think.

01:54.024 --> 01:55.105
The other students

01:55.608 --> 02:04.822
The Army and the Navy Marine students would say, you know, the Air Force guys, they don't do as many push-ups as we do and they don't run as far.

02:05.663 --> 02:08.087
It's not as challenging from that standpoint.

02:08.688 --> 02:13.475
But what I saw during my time here, it became, I think, more focused.

02:13.856 --> 02:19.725
It was this idea of challenge and rigor and running and physical fitness.

02:20.025 --> 02:23.370
All of those became...

02:24.397 --> 02:32.745
Factors it would cost people to select a certain program I remember one case There's one family.

02:32.765 --> 02:53.205
I believe they were from up around temple and they had several sons that were in the Aggie band in succession there and They were Air Force cadets here and The mother stopped me one time I think when one of her sons was coming as a freshman and

02:53.978 --> 03:14.319
And she wrote me a letter later to this effect that she wished, you know, all the people could participate in those kind of weekend bivouac kind of activities that the Army students do, where they go out there and repel and paint their faces and do all this stuff.

03:14.980 --> 03:17.022
She said, why doesn't the Air Force program do that?

03:17.082 --> 03:19.985
You know, it'd be more interesting and challenging if they did that.

03:21.286 --> 03:22.888
Well, I tried to explain that.

03:23.273 --> 03:28.899
I try to explain my answer to her, but it really comes down to the mission of the service.

03:29.820 --> 03:40.251
The Army's mission is to put people with rifles out on the battlefield and, you know, they do repel and they crawl under fences and they do all these things.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.153
They paint their faces up.

03:42.173 --> 03:47.779
In the Air Force, the offensive part is primarily airplanes.

03:48.147 --> 03:51.591
and pilots and navigators and so forth flying those airplanes.

03:51.691 --> 03:55.636
Enlisted folks are back at the home base maintaining these airplanes.

03:55.996 --> 03:57.218
It's a different mission.

03:57.798 --> 04:01.983
So there's no reason for the Air Force to teach repelling and all these things.

04:02.384 --> 04:09.812
But she clearly saw what the Army did is more fun for a cadet than what the Air Force guys did.

04:10.173 --> 04:14.678
But the Army capitalized on that feeling and was able to build up their program.

04:16.025 --> 04:32.911
During all of your years here as a Commandant, what were the realities of co-education in the Corps, the women?

04:33.452 --> 04:37.859
Now when you got back, the band had already been, were women already in the band?

04:37.899 --> 04:38.199
Right.

04:38.359 --> 04:39.501
So that had already been done.

04:39.920 --> 04:50.616
Were there any significant events during your years of where women began to move up in status and rank and responsibility in the Corps?

04:51.918 --> 04:58.828
I believe that is the case, although it's not in great numbers.

04:59.028 --> 05:05.758
I think I've talked in past sessions about the numbers of women has increased

05:06.160 --> 05:15.836
some over the years, and we did start an integration program back in the late 80s, about 89, 90s when we started that.

05:16.697 --> 05:24.650
And we did stress the idea that women were invited and encouraged to be in all organizations.

05:25.872 --> 05:32.202
We did have women in Parsons Mounted Cavalry, Ross Volunteers,

05:32.857 --> 05:34.439
A good many in the band.

05:34.499 --> 05:37.203
The band, I saw a marked increase in the number of women.

05:37.283 --> 05:39.205
The band was very accepting of women.

05:39.325 --> 05:41.088
Women did very well in the band.

05:42.289 --> 05:45.553
They had, these kids had worked with women in high school bands and all.

05:45.574 --> 05:50.600
There was just something there that made it more achievable in the band.

05:51.621 --> 05:58.290
I was disappointed that, say in the Ross Volunteers and the Parsons Mounted Cav, we

05:58.844 --> 06:00.707
stayed pretty much at the token level.

06:01.167 --> 06:05.413
There seemed to be a barrier there that we couldn't really get beyond one or two.

06:06.875 --> 06:10.320
By what method are you at liberty to speak about this?

06:11.201 --> 06:14.886
What is the selection process for members of Ross Volunteers?

06:14.906 --> 06:20.333
Well, there's written things that they should represent.

06:23.297 --> 06:27.383
I think adjectival kind of qualifications that they should

06:27.852 --> 06:50.265
meet but it's essentially the best of the best and but it's the student vote the students in the rvs those who are members of the rvs will get to vote next year and i believe it's just over 70 72 i guess it is new members each year and those students vote

06:50.887 --> 07:13.873
and they do that pretty much by themselves there's an advisor there that monitors that as I recall monitors the voting but it's a pretty set way to select them and I think generally they do select

07:14.360 --> 07:19.852
the right people, but there could be differences of opinion there about who should get in and who shouldn't.

07:19.872 --> 07:23.700
Had there been women, before you came back as Commandant, had there been women in the RVs?

07:25.864 --> 07:26.265
There was no.

07:26.285 --> 07:28.690
There may have been, but I can't remember

07:28.889 --> 07:32.835
There was no standout pioneer first female.

07:33.516 --> 07:36.741
We did have one the year before I came.

07:36.901 --> 07:39.104
Her name was Mandy, Amanda Schubert.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.427
She was the deputy corps commander.

07:42.529 --> 07:46.375
And that was held up as a real mark of achievement for women.

07:46.415 --> 07:47.116
The first time.

07:47.156 --> 07:48.077
What year would that have been?

07:48.197 --> 07:51.743
I would have been in 86, I believe.

07:52.364 --> 07:53.505
Or 87, 86, 87.

07:55.388 --> 07:57.411
But she was the deputy corps commander.

07:58.015 --> 08:02.021
and had established quite a mark for women in the Corps.

08:02.081 --> 08:02.862
I remember that.

08:02.962 --> 08:03.523
I met her.

08:03.723 --> 08:04.905
And also in the RVs.

08:05.185 --> 08:09.852
And I can't say for sure, but I think perhaps she was in the RVs.

08:09.932 --> 08:12.475
I don't recall that for sure, but that was the year before I came.

08:13.377 --> 08:21.508
Describe, if you would, for this machine how Corps commanders and other key Corps leaders are selected.

08:26.973 --> 08:34.083
When I came here, it was explained to me how it had been done before, and we followed that with some adjustments to it.

08:35.885 --> 08:45.959
At that point in time, the Corps had a sergeant major, a junior, who was designated as the Corps Sergeant Major.

08:46.620 --> 08:55.512
That junior was looked to as the leader of the junior class and the heir apparent to the Corps commander position.

08:55.880 --> 09:03.814
But we had a selection board, and early in February or so, we would have a selection board.

09:03.934 --> 09:15.795
I would chair that selection board, and I'd have ROTC representatives there, female representative on my staff, other top people.

09:16.417 --> 09:28.576
We didn't have cadets on that in the first years, but it was a group of about eight or ten cross-section of staff, ROTC, and we would do interviews.

09:28.636 --> 09:32.562
The students could apply for it if they wanted to be corps commander.

09:33.804 --> 09:39.032
They could be nominated for it by some cadet, but we would take those and

09:40.649 --> 09:43.854
In those first years, it just worked out.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.977
There was a manageable number that we could interview.

09:46.177 --> 09:47.759
But then we would hold interviews.

09:49.882 --> 09:53.908
Usually talk to them at least 30 minutes or longer during the interview.

09:53.968 --> 09:58.134
And we'd have a table set up and bring the individual in.

09:58.174 --> 10:00.398
And they'd walk in, salute, and sit down.

10:00.478 --> 10:05.425
And I would set the tone for the meeting and the questioning.

10:05.692 --> 10:10.778
We'd rotate to ask questions and see how they responded.

10:10.858 --> 10:23.533
We asked them all kind of questions we thought were appropriate, like, you know, what their style of leadership is and what would they do about certain things, you know, what's your feeling about this and that.

10:23.573 --> 10:27.598
Times we even asked, you know, what's your feeling about women in the Corps.

10:27.618 --> 10:29.961
All of these kind of questions were considered.

10:30.768 --> 10:53.198
And after we'd interviewed all the candidates, and usually it was maybe 10 candidates that had come to this point, we would call the corps commander in of that senior class and sit him down, it was a him in every case, and say,

10:53.465 --> 11:00.813
You know, of your impressions of these people, you've worked with them, some of them have been on your staff, but what's your evaluation of these candidates?

11:01.354 --> 11:07.461
I want the corps commander to have a firm input, a student input.

11:07.481 --> 11:15.310
And I think with every case that I was there, with one exception, it was an easy pick.

11:15.470 --> 11:21.177
There was a unanimous, there didn't seem to be any question about who it should be.

11:22.186 --> 11:34.646
The one exception was, I'm getting off track a little bit here, but anyway, this process would be concluded, and we would take a vote, and like I say, in every case except one, it was essentially unanimous from the first.

11:34.746 --> 11:37.931
It was obvious the leader stood out so well.

11:38.232 --> 11:41.697
And more often than not, it was the sergeant major.

11:41.963 --> 11:46.413
In earlier years it was, but I should finish that part.

11:47.254 --> 11:54.430
Some of the students came to me and said, you know, we're really selecting the sergeant major to end of the sophomore year.

11:54.871 --> 12:02.487
That really means we're selecting a corps commander to end of the sophomore year if it's just kind of an automatic thing that this one's going to fly up all the way.

12:02.922 --> 12:10.191
And we accepted that point and decided that we would not have a core sergeant major, that we would have a rotating one.

12:10.231 --> 12:21.904
We'd have the juniors on the staff rotate for six weeks, say, one would be the sergeant major and then another one to give them opportunity to train and learn and experience in this position.

12:21.964 --> 12:23.406
That seemed to work fine too.

12:23.887 --> 12:27.972
But the idea was no one should feel they've got a lock on this job.

12:27.992 --> 12:30.094
We want the best qualified person.

12:30.732 --> 12:42.325
And sometimes you learn more of the junior year or they may disappoint you a little bit, but on the other hand, usually you could pick the number one person even back then.

12:43.506 --> 12:50.414
I don't remember any year that I didn't think we selected really an outstanding person for this position.

12:52.016 --> 12:58.343
The one exception where it didn't seem so clear, we had a student,

12:59.622 --> 13:06.733
that was in the band, and I don't believe anyone had ever been selected to be corps commander out of the band.

13:07.134 --> 13:12.161
They were separate down there, they had their drills and practices, and it was just kinda taken for granted.

13:12.181 --> 13:15.667
A bandsman just out of the running.

13:17.570 --> 13:27.705
Maybe the band student hasn't had the breadth of the experience that he needed, or she needed, but this one student kinda stood out to us, and he seemed very

13:28.698 --> 13:33.424
much a leader, someone who had a grasp and pulse for everything.

13:34.425 --> 13:39.371
And that was kind of a split vote.

13:40.213 --> 13:44.498
And I asked to cast the deciding vote.

13:44.518 --> 13:51.547
And there were a few rankled feathers over that one that maybe I'd, you know, selected the wrong one.

13:52.708 --> 13:56.393
But that was the only time I got put in that position.

13:56.879 --> 14:03.889
But the student turned out to be very good and outstanding, one of the best young men I've ever been associated with.

14:03.909 --> 14:07.334
And they proved that one could come out of the band and be the corps commander.

14:07.354 --> 14:09.717
And I was glad to see that after that all happened.

14:11.139 --> 14:19.611
In hindsight, the people selected as corps commander, were they more likely to be Air Force, Army, or Navy, Marine?

14:21.494 --> 14:22.555
Or was there a pretty good variety?

14:22.575 --> 14:26.481
It was pretty much between the Army and the Air Force, I would say, most years.

14:27.035 --> 14:29.718
However, we did have one out of the Navy program.

14:29.758 --> 14:36.627
I can think of at least one, perhaps more than that, but no one service had a lock on that.

14:37.608 --> 14:53.768
The Army program, their summer camp program, I had an opportunity to visit up at Fort Lewis, Washington, and I thought an outstanding program did a good job of giving the Army contract cadets an extra leg on leadership and leadership training.

14:54.895 --> 15:00.744
But the Army program became bigger over time, so, you know, there were more students there.

15:02.567 --> 15:07.354
One conflict we had was whether you had to be under contract to be corps commander.

15:08.136 --> 15:11.501
You know, this, in old days, it was just, that's the way it was.

15:11.641 --> 15:18.351
I mean, they, mostly everyone under contract, and so a contract cadet would be the corps commander.

15:18.492 --> 15:23.299
You know, he would be commissioned and go into one of the services.

15:23.684 --> 15:43.188
But as we had more DNC students and more pressure, more concern about doing something for them and treating them fairly, giving them a fair break on this, at one point I think a lot of them felt they didn't have a chance for any real high leadership position in the Corps, especially Corps commanders.

15:43.809 --> 15:46.232
So we had to kind of reinforce the idea that

15:46.837 --> 15:48.701
anyone can be court commander.

15:48.761 --> 15:49.903
It's the best qualified.

15:49.923 --> 15:52.449
That's the simplest rule I could tell them.

15:52.469 --> 15:55.615
We want the best qualified person for this job.

15:55.675 --> 15:57.279
Now it's our job to figure that out.

15:58.221 --> 16:00.846
But we're not going to put any restrictions on who can

16:01.163 --> 16:02.144
be the corps commander.

16:02.544 --> 16:10.351
How did you inform the new corps commander designate that he had been selected?

16:13.294 --> 16:17.598
Called them into the office, called all the candidates in together.

16:18.939 --> 16:31.170
I remember them standing up and I think I still have a picture or two of this, but they'd be standing up in front of my office and I would compliment all of them and

16:32.635 --> 16:38.562
make a little speech there about how well they had performed and how any of them could have done the job.

16:38.602 --> 16:44.108
But after considering all, we'd selected so-and-so first to be the deputy corps commander.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.532
We went through the same, generally it was the same candidates.

16:47.672 --> 16:50.295
One would be named commander and one the deputy commander.

16:51.196 --> 16:54.260
And I would announce those candidates.

16:54.320 --> 16:58.845
And then we implemented the procedure a little later on and we'd meet down at the corps center and have a

16:59.568 --> 17:04.116
formal presentation of them before, friends and family and cohort.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.602
It was kind of a formal announcement of this.

17:08.063 --> 17:20.044
One thing we always did when I came here, General Simpson told me about, you know, we usually let the president officially name the commandant and deputy commandant.

17:20.064 --> 17:21.667
That had been a practice for a long time.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.550
And I thought that was quite appropriate.

17:24.290 --> 17:30.518
And so we'd always withhold full public disclosure until we had informed the president.

17:30.578 --> 17:41.092
And usually the president, at least he did in my days, would arrange a meeting and take the two over and sit down with the president.

17:41.993 --> 17:49.302
And, you know, he'd go through comments and congratulations, and we'd get photos.

17:49.788 --> 17:52.450
I think it added a lot of prestige to it.

17:52.490 --> 17:56.594
But I say I made the final decision or approval.

17:56.654 --> 17:57.855
Really, it was the president.

17:57.955 --> 18:01.618
I never considered myself the final stop on that.

18:02.139 --> 18:09.946
As far as you knew then, what kind of celebration did the selectees have that night?

18:11.607 --> 18:12.508
Was there any ritual?

18:13.429 --> 18:18.073
I don't, you know, I wasn't privy to any ritual other than

18:18.678 --> 18:45.732
they make an announcement or they would make an announcement in Duncan Dining Center to the whole Corps that this had happened and that always created some some hooping and hollering there and generally it was all very positive but you know if there was some ritual beyond that I wasn't in on that now during those years that you were commandant there were no minority

18:46.370 --> 18:48.935
race minority problems, were there?

18:50.057 --> 18:54.284
Things went rather smoothly in that area, didn't they?

18:54.344 --> 18:54.845
That's right.

18:55.146 --> 19:01.617
I don't recall any major racial problems that we had in the Corps.

19:01.637 --> 19:09.812
I remember one or two small complaints that people had, but you know, as far as a big racial problem,

19:10.366 --> 19:15.172
like happening across the country or had in years past or even in the military.

19:15.192 --> 19:18.958
You know, we had our share of racial problems some years back.

19:20.520 --> 19:25.266
But generally, cadets were accepting of other races.

19:25.286 --> 19:33.437
As long as you would do your part, put out your best effort, the Corps has always been quite willing to accept people of any race.

19:35.580 --> 19:37.943
Like I tell people, as far as I know, in

19:38.851 --> 19:48.182
as A&M opened up to women and to other races, the black students had an easier time here as pioneers than the women did.

19:48.202 --> 19:49.543
I would agree.

19:52.166 --> 20:02.378
Let's see, other major decisions that the commandant had to make, corps commander and things like that, what are some other major decisions that you had to make every year?

20:09.850 --> 20:15.278
Well, a lot of individual cases, disciplinary cases.

20:17.061 --> 20:18.002
Don't give me an example.

20:18.022 --> 20:22.028
What was the sorts of things that these might involve?

20:25.033 --> 20:31.382
They could involve hazing, harassment, abuse, those kind of things.

20:31.422 --> 20:31.843
Drugs?

20:32.464 --> 20:32.864
Drugs.

20:33.025 --> 20:37.011
I only remember one or two drug problems in my years.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.693
I always felt comfortable.

20:39.517 --> 20:42.681
that we did not have a major drug problem in the Corps.

20:42.841 --> 20:43.522
What about drinking?

20:43.903 --> 20:48.850
Drinking was a significant problem, one that concerned me all my years.

20:49.030 --> 20:56.540
I was never satisfied with our statuses regarding alcohol.

20:56.660 --> 20:58.683
What were they primarily drinking?

20:58.723 --> 20:59.704
Was it beer or whiskey?

21:01.226 --> 21:04.571
I'd say beer probably more than... That's what I would have guessed.

21:04.591 --> 21:05.592
Mostly.

21:08.255 --> 21:18.288
But it seemed like most of our problems some way, major problems, not always, but frequently related to alcohol.

21:18.788 --> 21:21.992
What were some of the goofiest situations you had to deal with?

21:23.454 --> 21:34.448
Well, I mentioned one or two of those haul-off cases where they haul a commander off one to Fort Stockton, Texas at an airplane, one to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.

21:35.272 --> 22:02.224
I remember one case that made the newspaper here and it was I think in the same season that they did the haul offs and this one guy had been captured by his freshman and I think they had shaved his growing area and put the heel and sole

22:03.065 --> 22:09.476
That was a favorite trick, to put heel and sole on people, where they shaved them and stuff like that.

22:10.237 --> 22:13.723
And they had this guy, and they were making all these pictures of him.

22:14.384 --> 22:16.808
One kid had made a whole roll or more.

22:18.050 --> 22:22.457
And he takes them down here to the drugstore somewhere to get them developed.

22:23.787 --> 22:26.331
thinking, boy, you know, we're going to have some gems out of this.

22:27.232 --> 22:37.987
And the people that developed the photos see this, and it looks like this guy is bound and gagged or something, and it looks like a criminal thing to them.

22:38.047 --> 22:42.994
And they notify the authorities that a crime may have been presented.

22:42.974 --> 23:08.290
they didn't know what it was all about but this guy being tied and hand some handcuffs on him and all this but they turned it in and you know it ends up out here and bob white gets it and you know it turns out it's the clue to this hazing incident you know they label it hazing and that was an interesting case it was it was a prank it was

23:08.270 --> 23:14.921
kind of innocent in my opinion, but you could look at it another way as something very serious.

23:15.001 --> 23:25.818
But these guys got surprised their life when their photos were confiscated and they were hauled up on charges of, I don't remember what they were exactly.

23:26.299 --> 23:28.522
How often did your phone ring in the middle of the night?

23:29.564 --> 23:31.427
It's not unusual for my phone to ring.

23:32.408 --> 23:33.370
But once a week or?

23:33.691 --> 23:34.632
Oh, at least.

23:35.573 --> 23:41.000
Everything from major incidents.

23:41.020 --> 23:57.361
We had a lot of cases of students passing out from running or sometimes apprehension and all plus running and heat and things like that could cause them to pass out and they're taken to the health center, sometimes off campus.

23:57.822 --> 23:59.904
Lots of those kind of calls off and on.

24:01.506 --> 24:04.450
Normally, who was it that called you with those serious matters?

24:04.919 --> 24:08.244
An appropriate, responsible person.

24:08.344 --> 24:08.605
Right.

24:09.106 --> 24:22.566
Colonel Lee McCleskey was brought on not always after I started over there, sometime after, but he became the training discipline officer after about three or four years I'd been over there.

24:22.627 --> 24:29.998
But he became a man in between me and all the stuff that's happening down there in my earlier years, you know.

24:30.367 --> 24:33.253
I frequently got it called from the guard room.

24:34.576 --> 24:37.983
Did members of the Corps, did students ever call you?

24:38.083 --> 24:38.384
Yes.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.105
Is that right?

24:40.268 --> 24:40.809
Yes, they did.

24:40.829 --> 24:47.583
The Corps commanders a lot of time were very good about calling me about incidents.

24:47.683 --> 24:50.569
No, but I'm talking about some student calling you as a prank.

24:52.810 --> 24:57.345
I can't think of anything that was doing a prank on me.

24:58.187 --> 25:02.702
I can't think of anything like that, that they did a prank on me, not really.

25:02.817 --> 25:07.805
Because I would have thought that would have been a big deal to wake up the commandant or something like that.

25:07.825 --> 25:12.592
Well, I had a lot of phone calls that, you know, somebody would just be breathing or talking or saying something crazy.

25:12.632 --> 25:14.174
I never knew who those people were.

25:15.196 --> 25:18.941
But I used to get those calls all the time, unidentified people now.

25:19.182 --> 25:20.884
That may have been cadets, I don't know.

25:21.706 --> 25:28.015
I had one call that related to a death that...

25:28.518 --> 25:30.179
that I remember quite well.

25:30.199 --> 25:42.890
We had the big military weekend with the visiting students and had a big ball over in the, a big dinner over in Duncan and a ball after it right there.

25:43.311 --> 25:57.883
And I remember after the speech, we stood around there a while and walked over to the area where they were dancing and

25:59.045 --> 26:20.405
We didn't stay there long, and my wife and I were headed home, and I got this call that we had a student that was being transported to the hospital that he passed out in his room and said he had an asthma attack.

26:20.425 --> 26:23.868
He was at this event we just attended, a freshman.

26:25.870 --> 26:28.933
And I thought, well, that can't be too serious, an asthma attack.

26:30.668 --> 26:33.833
But by the time I got home, I got a call that he'd died.

26:35.616 --> 26:38.640
But he was allergic to pecans.

26:40.583 --> 26:41.204
And he knew that.

26:41.825 --> 26:45.010
And we had carrot cake that night for dessert.

26:45.430 --> 26:46.512
That's dinner we had.

26:47.273 --> 26:51.720
And apparently he'd had a little bit of pecan.

26:52.701 --> 26:55.986
And he had this choking and all.

26:56.047 --> 26:58.971
And he couldn't get his medicine soon enough.

26:59.525 --> 27:00.750
Very tragic thing.

27:00.971 --> 27:01.775
Oh, I didn't know that.

27:01.795 --> 27:02.598
Very good kid.

27:02.779 --> 27:04.346
I didn't know that was ever that severe.

27:04.426 --> 27:07.037
My, my.

27:07.523 --> 27:10.708
He passed away, you know, before I could believe it.

27:11.048 --> 27:17.679
And when I first heard asthma, I thought, well, you know, I never dreamed it would be a life-threatening situation.

27:19.542 --> 27:25.030
But I've had, you know, that extreme, but lots of cases where people are hurt.

27:25.952 --> 27:29.397
I think I told you about the family.

27:29.457 --> 27:35.927
I've had three or four major incidents in Parsons Mounted Cavalry where students were seriously injured.

27:36.768 --> 27:40.632
and their life hang in the balance.

27:42.735 --> 27:49.002
Those are of course the worst kind of calls but a lot of calls that just involve little stuff.

27:49.302 --> 27:57.312
Now we didn't have any Corps members attempt to kidnap Bevo or any other mascots during your years was there?

27:57.752 --> 28:02.117
Well I don't know that they tried to kidnap Bevo but they did a lot of other

28:02.857 --> 28:25.270
pranks you know from painting up campuses to stealing letters off the bailer on the bailer sign on front we had students captured over at austin that seemed to be every year something like that happened and i don't know how much went on that didn't get caught you just know the things that

28:25.823 --> 28:31.752
that get reported, but had numerous cases of, mostly in Austin, some at Baylor.

28:32.473 --> 28:34.736
Those are the only ones that.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.899
In the 10 years you were coming up?

28:36.919 --> 28:37.079
Nine.

28:37.240 --> 28:37.760
Nine years.

28:40.084 --> 28:47.815
Who were some of the key support people, like Bob Wyatt, General Simpson, who were those folks at?

28:49.027 --> 28:51.012
John Colas, of course, was my boss.

28:51.272 --> 28:51.994
Howard Perry.

28:52.816 --> 28:56.464
Howard was a very close friend and gave me lots of good advice and all.

28:56.524 --> 29:00.032
Howard was, you know, kind of ran

29:00.113 --> 29:02.336
one aspect of student services there.

29:02.356 --> 29:03.998
He ran the budget and all of that.

29:04.078 --> 29:07.102
But Howard was a wise fellow, had been here a long time, knew a lot of people.

29:07.963 --> 29:10.846
But he was a good friend and a good supporter.

29:11.046 --> 29:11.787
General Simpson.

29:12.188 --> 29:15.111
What was his official task?

29:15.292 --> 29:16.313
General Simpson.

29:17.855 --> 29:22.981
When I came here, he had retired and he was a mentor.

29:23.441 --> 29:23.742
Okay.

29:24.583 --> 29:25.564
He would

29:25.713 --> 29:27.675
Students could come and visit with him.

29:28.115 --> 29:30.678
You know, he'd hold office so many hours a week.

29:30.718 --> 29:37.104
I think he'd come in the afternoons maybe three times a week or something like that, and students could come in and visit with him.

29:37.985 --> 29:46.854
But, you know, when I came here, I'm not sure General Simpson supported my coming or selection.

29:46.874 --> 29:48.095
You know, I didn't know him.

29:48.235 --> 29:49.036
I didn't really know him.

29:50.397 --> 29:53.560
And my first meeting with or two with him, we...

29:54.282 --> 30:02.033
You know, he kind of laid out some of the problems and kind of gave me a charge and like, you're a new fellow here, guy.

30:02.053 --> 30:04.376
I don't know you, but you know you got your work cut out.

30:04.476 --> 30:07.761
And he kind of set things out for me there.

30:08.822 --> 30:15.852
But it was, as he offered to be helpful and opportunity for me to come visit with him and wanted me to,

30:16.203 --> 30:22.472
And we got those contacts going, and he became really one of my strongest allies and friends here.

30:23.013 --> 30:25.176
His task had been officially what?

30:25.196 --> 30:27.079
Head of the School of Military Sciences.

30:27.680 --> 30:36.593
And that's an interesting subject I don't think we've had much chance you might want to pursue, but I had this dual title of Commandant and Head of the School of Military Sciences.

30:36.673 --> 30:37.834
Describe that.

30:38.555 --> 30:43.763
It was not well explained to me when I came here, but they said General Simpson had occupied this...

30:44.536 --> 30:47.442
of head of the School of Military Sciences for a few years there.

30:47.482 --> 30:49.305
I guess it was under Dr. Williams.

30:49.385 --> 30:51.930
I'm not sure who first brought him on board.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.716
I believe he was, but the Corps was having a lot of problems.

30:54.736 --> 30:56.118
General Simpson mentioned to me.

30:56.198 --> 31:01.228
He had retired and was living in Bryan, and Jack Williams, I believe he was,

31:01.208 --> 31:06.053
that knew him and said, hey, why don't you come out and help us with the Corps.

31:06.654 --> 31:11.979
And that all worked out that General Simpson became the head of the School of Military Sciences.

31:12.119 --> 31:18.907
I could look back in the files and I could see some of the correspondence that used to go from the Commandant up to General Simpson.

31:19.487 --> 31:22.751
And they looked to him for a lot of guidance, a lot of direction.

31:22.791 --> 31:24.292
He gave direction, too.

31:25.173 --> 31:28.937
It wasn't just merely mentoring suggestions.
