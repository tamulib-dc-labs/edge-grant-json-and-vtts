WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:15.459
At that time of the years of the war, early stages, 
the B-17 began to take head-on attacks by the

00:02.140 --> 00:15.459
German fighters in Europe, and they were being 
shot down. They were losing a lot of B-17s. As a

00:17.442 --> 00:23.170
matter of fact, the whole daylight bombing 
concept was in jeopardy. General LeMay at that

00:23.656 --> 00:39.596
time was a division commander, I think a full 
colonel, and

00:23.656 --> 00:39.596
he was devising tactics and formations for the 
B-17s to combat just such tactics. So we acted as

00:39.617 --> 00:47.807
the fighters against formations of B-17s in the 
Orlando area in Florida. and made head-on attacks

00:48.412 --> 00:50.956
at B-17s. And boy, I tell you, at times it got hairy. 
It was worse than combat. Did it come in that close?

00:58.126 --> 00:58.387
Oh, yeah. Well, as a matter of fact,

00:58.487 --> 01:07.980
when Bob Houck, I think his name was H-O-U-K, I 
believe that was his name. I'd have to refer to my

01:08.041 --> 01:10.644
diary. He hit a B-17 head-on with a P-47, and he was 
flying between a number... two engine and the

01:16.846 --> 01:22.932
fuselage head on. Well, it was simulating exactly 
the tactics that the B-17 were confronted with in

01:23.152 --> 01:29.519
Europe. And did the B-17 probably went down, too? 
Did it kill that group? No, I think they bailed out.

01:41.831 --> 01:46.836
I think it was a result of that that they divided the 
chin turret for the B-17. when they put the guns,

01:47.609 --> 01:53.339
.50 caliber turrets in the chin of the B-17 forward 
firing. It was that type of tactics we

01:54.681 --> 01:59.649
experimented with, and it was quite realistic. 
And as I say, I think it did good in devising

02:00.751 --> 02:12.250
tactics, and particularly training the new boys 
that were taking groups and going overseas,

02:00.751 --> 02:12.250
expanding the Air Force. Then it was at that time, 
doing that type of work, that in early 43, when I was

02:12.753 --> 02:29.951
tabbed to go to Washington to be interviewed by 
General Arnold for a possible job to Moscow with

02:12.753 --> 02:29.951
Herman. And of course, I didn't know about what the 
purpose was at that time, except I was told to

02:30.131 --> 02:36.637
report to Washington. So now we're approaching 
the start Russian episode. Well, I want to find out

02:41.870 --> 02:43.652
about tactics. Did you change tactics because of 
the way that the Germans were coming head on, or was

02:43.732 --> 02:53.583
it just basically putting another mount on the 
B-17? It was, I think it was a change a little bit of

02:53.903 --> 02:58.968
the formation of the B-17. It probably was a 
tighter formation with more B-17s up front, a

02:59.028 --> 03:10.300
flatter B, if you will, plus the Chin turret, new 
firepower for the front. Now, in fighter tactics,

03:10.853 --> 03:18.680
we stressed, just strictly fighter tactics, 
air-to-air combat. We had to stress a difference

03:18.840 --> 03:24.345
in the European theater versus the Far Eastern 
theater. And what was that? In the European

03:25.325 --> 03:30.730
theater, it was exactly the reverse of what it was 
in the Far Eastern theater. As I told you before,

03:31.371 --> 03:34.513
you know, the Zero was for maneuverable. It was 
strictly hit-and-run and dive-out tactics in the

03:34.533 --> 03:38.757
Far East. Whereas in Europe, our aircraft could 
maneuver easily and maybe in some cases

03:40.418 --> 03:51.389
outmaneuver the Focke-Wulfs and the 
Messerschmitts.

03:51.569 --> 03:52.090
And the what? Messerschmitts. And 
Messerschmitts. Particularly when we got the

03:55.453 --> 03:57.856
P-51 Mustang. So, in other words, in Europe, you 
tango with them, fight them, maneuver with them.

04:03.362 --> 04:05.223
In the Far East, no. What did you think was the 
quality of the German aircraft? I've never flown

04:09.308 --> 04:19.044
one of them, but talking to the pilot and of course 
reading about their, no doubt the German aircraft

04:09.308 --> 04:19.044
was a fine airplane. Were they superior to ours in 
any way? Initially it was the forest period of

04:22.971 --> 04:25.375
B-40. We found that out in North Africa. As a matter 
of fact, that's one reason. Flying Tigers got the

04:29.187 --> 04:30.969
P-40. The British said it was, you know, it just 
wasn't good enough. And that's the reason they

04:34.252 --> 04:37.715
developed the Spitfire series. And then that's 
the reason we went to the Mustang. And then the old

04:41.359 --> 04:51.028
jug, the turbo-cubitar aircraft that had a lot of 
power at altitude.

04:51.048 --> 04:56.093
Towards the end of the war, our aircraft were 
easily comparable, of course. But I always go back

04:56.113 --> 04:57.895
to the the bottom line criteria that was the 
quality of our pilots. Pilots. The quality of our

05:05.383 --> 05:07.185
pilots. And compare them with the Japanese pilots 
and the German pilots. One of those against the

05:12.170 --> 05:13.432
other one? Yeah. I think the German was superior. 
But I don't have personal experience in fighting

05:15.454 --> 05:18.137
with the German. And compare ours with those two. 
Equally or better, I don't thank any pilot. I still

05:24.924 --> 05:26.245
am the old. I think the American fighter pilot is 
the best in the world. Would you agree today that

05:34.249 --> 05:35.712
they are?

05:39.460 --> 05:42.567
Well, I don't know the quality of... Or when you 
left the service? Oh, when I left the service,

05:43.529 --> 05:47.237
yeah, I still had confidence we were the greatest. 
Of course, you know, combat experience, we've had

05:47.504 --> 05:52.990
more actual war experience later than any of the 
other nations. Of course, the Germans, I mean, the

05:53.150 --> 05:59.297
Russians have probably had their experience in 
Afghanistan, but practically against what?

05:59.377 --> 05:59.658
Nothing. Now, what about training? As far as the 
training, you were training men down there to be

06:01.320 --> 06:06.185
combat pilots, basically. How good was the 
training? Then or now? In Orlando, then. Oh,

06:10.830 --> 06:12.272
superb. Tops, you couldn't beat it. That's the 
reason we were killing some pilots, because it was

06:14.538 --> 06:17.842
realistic.

06:19.924 --> 06:20.985
But did that bother you? No. Matter of fact, I think 
it's a sin to send a pilot over to war and not have him

06:22.226 --> 06:28.734
trained. Yeah. I think that's wrong. But who knows 
what the necessities might require. We may not

06:35.361 --> 06:36.382
have the time.

06:39.365 --> 06:43.650
Now, why do you think that you were chosen to go up 
and see General Arnold? I'm not sure, but this is an

06:44.693 --> 06:51.759
interesting story, and let me tell you about it. I 
got a call at my fighter base in Florida to report to

06:52.700 --> 07:14.498
General Arnold's office, oh, it gave me two or 
three days leeway, but at nine o'clock one

06:52.700 --> 07:14.498
morning, and I did so, and it was on the basis of 
General Arnold wanted to talk to four

07:14.900 --> 07:34.024
pilots of Lieutenant Colonel rank with combat 
experience that had flown a lot of different

07:14.900 --> 07:34.024
airplanes and who could use his head. That's the 
only criteria. Is that what they said? Right. And

07:38.710 --> 07:43.776
General Peabody, at that time, commanding the 
School of Applied Tactics, told me personally

07:45.460 --> 07:50.725
that it seemed like I fitted that description. So 
he recommended me to General Arnold, and I got my

07:51.426 --> 08:02.938
P-47, my jug, and flew up to Washington. And there 
were four of us lined up in General Half Arnold's

08:02.958 --> 08:07.242
office. This was in the Pentagon. And he went down 
the line just asking one after the other. Would you

08:14.594 --> 08:15.736
like to go overseas? And one of the boys' answer 
was, well, sir, I just got back and I'd like to get

08:17.098 --> 08:25.110
more familiar with my baby daughter, which 
incidentally was exactly my case. He said, okay.

08:29.297 --> 08:34.044
He asked another guy, would you like to go 
overseas? He said, if you give me a fighter group of

08:34.064 --> 08:39.312
P-51, I'll go right now. And third one, I forget 
what he asked him and what the answer was, but it's

08:40.912 --> 08:47.518
somewhat along the same line that it came to be. And 
he says, Bond, would you like to go overseas? And to

08:54.904 --> 09:09.417
the best of my knowledge, to be very exact, I think I 
said, well, General, I think you remember that you

08:54.904 --> 09:09.417
promised that if I went back overseas, you told 
General Chenault I could go back with him. And he

09:11.438 --> 09:26.681
looked at me rather straight and very 
thoughtfully thinking, turned around, walked

09:11.438 --> 09:26.681
over to the window and gazed out the window a few 
minutes. Turned around, leaned back, pulled his

09:26.701 --> 09:33.612
blouse apart, put his hand on his hips. I rank 
Chenault.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.741
And then grinned. And after that, we dismissed us 
as well. I said, I'll let you all know tomorrow

09:44.518 --> 09:46.059
morning. The next morning, all four of us reported 
in at 9 o'clock. And you had no idea what this was

09:50.683 --> 09:53.385
for. Had no idea what it was for. But now, one out of 
the four said, yes, sir, I'll go any place, any

09:54.667 --> 09:59.491
time. Under certain conditions, see. Everybody 
had conditions. Everybody had conditions,

10:02.694 --> 10:04.555
including mine. And of course, the general arm 
personally made the decision. The secretary

10:10.315 --> 10:13.999
said, Colonel Bond, the general would like to see 
you. Well, maybe he said that. You know, all four of

10:16.222 --> 10:18.144
us were sitting there. All four of us knew then, of 
course. It's pretty obvious it was going to be me.

10:23.510 --> 10:35.945
So I went in, and I can't recollect everything we 
talked about, except that I think he did start out

10:23.510 --> 10:35.945
and said, this job isn't for generals at all. But he 
said, no. tell you what it is, and I want this kept

10:37.180 --> 10:41.824
absolutely secret. You can't talk to anybody 
about it. Including your wife? Including, well,

10:46.929 --> 10:48.591
obviously. He said, you're not supposed to, you 
know, this is like a wartime secret. You just don't

10:51.634 --> 10:53.095
tell anybody. And that, you know, I immediately 
began to be tense and wondered what in the world is

10:54.156 --> 10:58.800
this? Well, I knew it's overseas because that's 
the question he asked me. He said, you're going to

11:02.544 --> 11:05.206
go to Russia with that Mr. Herm. Do you know Mr. 
Herm? No sir, I don't. And of course, then he

11:09.364 --> 11:18.893
explained to me what it would be for sending a 
military mission to Moscow for closer

11:09.364 --> 11:18.893
cooperation with them. And you're going to be 
Ambassador Herrmann's aide for me. You're going

11:24.419 --> 11:27.722
to be my aide for Ambassador Herrmann. You're 
going to have the Air Division part of a mission

11:27.742 --> 11:36.651
we're going to put in Moscow for cooperation with 
Russia to win this war against Europe, against

11:27.742 --> 11:36.651
Hitler. Also, were you the pilot for Herrmann? 
Yes. That was another part of the- See, that's

11:41.537 --> 11:43.779
another part. Flown all types of airplanes. And 
obviously what had in mind, we were going to pick

11:46.342 --> 11:55.610
out an airplane, make it into as plush an airplane 
as we could for the ambassador to go back and forth

11:46.342 --> 11:55.610
to Russia. It turned out to be an old converted 
B-24, which was a liberator in an air transport

11:55.630 --> 12:06.840
model with a bomb bay taken out. bunks and chairs 
and put it in, which I'd never flown. I'd never

12:10.492 --> 12:14.617
flown a B-24, but I had to be checked out of here 
immediately as part of the job. Well, that's he

12:14.878 --> 12:16.199
explained it. He said, do you think you can do it? 
And of course I said, yes, sir. And he said, okay,

12:20.024 --> 12:25.030
you go in and see, of course, General Vandenberg. 
He was a brigadier general at that time. And who

12:27.273 --> 12:28.875
served with me came chief of staff. Sure did. And 
worked with him. So from then on, of course, that's

12:32.400 --> 12:34.563
what I did. And about, uh, Well, what were your 
thoughts? Did you want to go, or did, just tell me.

12:41.834 --> 12:43.436
Oh, yes, I was very excited. This was completely a 
new experience for me. I was very excited about it,

12:47.220 --> 13:04.080
and I, of course, wanted to immediately tell my 
wife about it, Doris, but I was reluctant because

12:47.220 --> 13:04.080
of the secrecy of the thing, and she was still in 
Orlando, of course, and then I thought about my new

13:04.516 --> 13:11.044
little baby daughter, and that this is going to be 
tough on her, it's going to be hard, but I want to go.

13:12.406 --> 13:21.838
And of course, I'm in the military, if he's chosen 
me and General Arnold, the Chief of Staff of the Air

13:12.406 --> 13:21.838
Force, then gee, I ought to go. And I knew this would 
be, it was a feather in my cap, I knew it would

13:22.558 --> 13:30.188
definitely enhance a career. I'd be in a new area 
that I'd never been exposed to before in a

13:32.056 --> 13:42.185
diplomatic video with a very important person, 
Mr. Harriman. I'd read about him, but I didn't know

13:42.225 --> 13:44.647
him. And here dealing with the Russians, a country 
I'd never been to before. It was somewhat like my

13:50.031 --> 13:54.756
experience when I knew I was going to go to China, a 
new adventure. So I was very excited. And

13:57.958 --> 14:01.101
eventually, of course, But on the back, I had to 
explain to my wife. I didn't tell her until about a

14:04.296 --> 14:10.264
week later what my job was going to be. Nobody knew 
what it was going to be. But of course, I made it. I

14:13.388 --> 14:18.155
was released from duty in my job in Florida. And I 
was taking trips every day to various places. And

14:23.662 --> 14:30.632
one of the biggest requirements immediately was 
to get checked out in the B-24 in a base in

14:23.662 --> 14:30.632
Tennessee. so that I could fly the Ambassador over 
in his airplane, the Liberator. In the meantime,

14:37.266 --> 14:43.259
it was being converted and pushed up inside at 
another air base. Did you keep the gun mounts on it?

14:44.823 --> 14:45.805
No, no, no. This is strictly an air transport 
version. Was it to fly singly or with a fighter

14:50.204 --> 14:53.429
escort? Oh, no, no. Strictly, you know, we would 
never get in the combat area with the airplane. In

14:59.437 --> 15:03.043
effect, it was an air transport command type 
aircraft. But I was to be the pilot. I had a crew. Did

15:05.787 --> 15:07.369
you make it nice and plush? Oh, yeah. Well, as plush 
as you could one of those airplanes. The Air Force

15:09.832 --> 15:12.036
wasn't choosy about that. You knew under wartime 
conditions, as long as it was a dependable

15:12.076 --> 15:17.684
airplane. Was it? Yes. Oh, yes. Turned out to be a 
good old airplane. And how fast did it go? It's not

15:23.142 --> 15:24.564
like a B-17. It's not quite as fast as a B-17. It's 
more of a little bit harder to fly. It was a

15:29.831 --> 15:35.619
lumbering type aircraft, wallowed a lot in the 
air, but you could use an automatic pilot. It had

15:35.639 --> 15:43.971
turbo superchargers on it to fly well at altitude, 
but of course it wasn't pressurized.

15:45.014 --> 15:50.880
If you get above 12,000 feet, you have to have 
oxygen to be comfortable, so we never fly very

15:45.014 --> 15:50.880
high. No need to, except when we fly over the 
mountains from Tehran, when we take off to go over

15:50.900 --> 16:03.073
the mountains mainly south of the Caucasus area. 
But I think if I ever got there, it was about 13,000

16:04.815 --> 16:10.060
feet for about 15, 20 minutes. How about your crew? 
I selected my own crew. I had a co-pilot,

16:12.992 --> 16:19.400
navigator, radio operator, and crew chief. We had 
our

16:19.741 --> 16:26.670
base maintenance support out of an air base in 
Cairo.

16:30.855 --> 16:33.178
Where'd you keep the plane? In Moscow? what we 
called a central airport at that time. It was, if

16:38.590 --> 16:44.418
you will, the main terminal airport for the city of 
Moscow. I don't even know why it's called today.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.982
Who maintained the flight? My crew maintained it. 
Well, we just had the crew chief and, of course, the

16:50.806 --> 16:56.754
radio operator. But when we had major maintenance 
requirements or inspections, we'd take it down to

16:56.774 --> 17:03.182
the air base in Cairo. I forget the name of that 
base. It was the United States American Air Force

17:05.061 --> 17:08.846
Base. How about as far as keeping it in a hangar and 
just housing the airplane? How did you get along

17:14.375 --> 17:17.079
with the Russians on that? Well, we didn't have a 
hangar. We kept it parked outside. They didn't

17:23.168 --> 17:28.116
have a hangar on that air base at the time to take 
care of that bigger airplane. Russian guards were

17:29.438 --> 17:32.022
on the airplane 24 hours a day. Even I had trouble 
getting to the airplane. I'd have to call through

17:35.794 --> 18:00.051
my interpreters from the embassy out to the 
airport and through an interpreter and tell them,

17:35.794 --> 18:00.051
arrange for a particular hour that Colonel Bond, 
incidentally, within a couple of months after I

17:35.794 --> 18:00.051
was in Moscow with the Airmen, I was the most 
important colonel, and they'd tell the Russian

18:01.887 --> 18:11.836
security forces that Colonel Bond and his crew 
would be out to his airplane by a certain time, and

18:01.887 --> 18:11.836
you know, they have to wait to get to the airplane, 
and the guard would be told this. In one occasion,

18:13.278 --> 18:22.707
we had a little trouble in communication, and 
apparently the guard wasn't told and didn't know,

18:13.278 --> 18:22.707
and the guard would not let me get to the airplane. 
As a matter of fact, he pulled his rifle off his

18:22.727 --> 18:27.331
shoulder and pointed it at me and said, near, near. 
And the only thing I could do was take the crew back

18:28.552 --> 18:31.675
to the operation building and through the 
interpreters, getting through the security

18:32.347 --> 18:38.093
forces, and they had to change the guard. They 
didn't change the orders to the guard. They

18:41.057 --> 18:43.379
changed the guard and gave him new orders. And I 
want to tell you at this point,

18:45.722 --> 19:00.598
I can say that we in America didn't know what 
security was, in my opinion, until we met and

18:45.722 --> 19:00.598
became compliant with Russian security. It was 
just absolutely ironclad. There's just no

19:06.203 --> 19:11.911
comparison in our security, in my opinion, 
compared with the Russian security. And this

19:11.971 --> 19:23.066
perfect example was the Tehran conference, where 
President Roosevelt and Stalin and Prime

19:11.971 --> 19:23.066
Minister Churchill met. And of course, they had 
these three type of security forces all over the

19:23.366 --> 19:28.733
city. And when I had to get out to my airplane at the 
airport to do some maintenance on it. While they

19:32.652 --> 19:40.881
were meeting, I had to go from the American camp on 
one side of the city to the city of Tehran to get to

19:32.652 --> 19:40.881
the airport. I had to pass through some of these 
guards, and I met American, British, and Russian

19:40.901 --> 19:46.528
guards. When I came to the American guards, 
typical, well, who are you? Stop me, and so forth.

19:51.013 --> 19:57.180
Challenged me in my jeep, and I told him, and well, I 
showed him my identification and all, and he, OK,

19:51.013 --> 19:57.180
go ahead. Went to the British Guard. He was a little 
bit more strict. And finally agreed, OK, go ahead.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.400
But I went and met the Russian Guard. And yet, I was 
not required. I was not permitted to go past them.

20:11.329 --> 20:12.210
He didn't care who I was. I had to turn around, go 
back to the camp, and then through telephone and

20:12.511 --> 20:22.826
communications with proper security forces, get 
a new pass to go through the Russian Guard. That is

20:22.846 --> 20:24.849
typical of the difference, in my opinion. It's 
just absolutely iron bound. What's your opinion

20:29.543 --> 20:31.765
on that? Is it favorable, unfavorable? Oh, I was 
impressed. These people, when they say secure,

20:35.789 --> 20:39.012
they mean secure.

20:41.815 --> 20:50.884
Whereas a little bit of give and take, you know, an 
hour, it's just... And in my opinion, I think this

20:41.815 --> 20:50.884
is still true. In my subsequent days in Russia, you 
know, came to... Many meetings attended with

20:59.260 --> 21:08.973
Russians and the diplomats at the highest level in 
the Kremlin right on down to the military forces in

20:59.260 --> 21:08.973
the field. I took several trips to the front. And it 
was always the same thing. I was impressed with

21:12.998 --> 21:16.082
their security. Okay, now let's go back to get 
ahead of ourselves. Yeah, let's go back. The plane

21:22.890 --> 21:27.136
is outfitted, and then what, you met Ambassador 
Harriman? I had several meetings. various times

21:29.753 --> 21:31.295
with the Ambassador. Before he left America? Oh 
yes, and we discussed he wanted to know me better

21:33.637 --> 21:41.005
and I wanted to know him better and we immediately 
got along great. I admired him from the very

21:41.426 --> 21:44.649
outset. Why? He impressed me as a real diplomat. He 
talked quietly and softly and

21:59.842 --> 22:08.117
His mannerisms, I'll never forget, is he would 
continually put his hands in his coat pockets. His

22:08.898 --> 22:10.881
coat was buttoned, and he had a mannerism. He was 
always going to put his hands in his coat pockets,

22:10.901 --> 22:17.193
and he'd stand away for a while, maybe walk back and 
forth and talk to you a little. Then he'd take his

22:17.233 --> 22:18.435
hands out. Then when he'd get to another real 
serious point, he'd take that pose again. I, it's

22:23.838 --> 22:26.201
funny, I still remember this. And I've since seen 
pictures of him. You know, he's some around 80 some

22:28.444 --> 22:30.967
odd years old now. And I notice he still does this. I 
see him in TV. He wasn't going to take his wife. He

22:37.095 --> 22:38.136
was taking his daughter. And he introduced me to 
her, a young girl. She was unmarried. A very

22:42.542 --> 22:44.465
pleasant person. And both of them spoke more with 
the English brogue. Mm-hmm. I never will forget

22:49.758 --> 22:51.461
this. When he first spoke to me, I thought, gee, he 
sounds English. And Kathy, his daughter,

22:55.109 --> 22:58.235
definitely had the English bro. And I think this 
might stem from, you know, he'd had a lot of

22:59.137 --> 23:07.152
experience and time in the diplomatic service in 
England. He was a very wealthy man, you know, a very

23:07.172 --> 23:12.002
wealthy man from the New York area. and he had had 
dealing with Russia before, and incidentally he

23:12.421 --> 23:18.289
was, you know, this was the ambassador. We didn't 
have an ambassador at that time. I think there was

23:20.812 --> 23:33.408
an admiral,

23:20.812 --> 23:33.408
there was an admiral who had been on sort of a 
semi-ambassadorial staff. Acting, acting

23:33.428 --> 23:34.870
ambassador. Who? Acting ambassador. We had 
Joseph Davies, Yeah, he was one. But they weren't

23:42.268 --> 23:43.970
assigned strictly. Well, maybe they were. And 
then Ehrman came about. Ehrman was going to be the

23:47.614 --> 23:55.662
ambassador, and he was going to stay in the embassy 
in Moscow. And we had, I remember

23:56.022 --> 24:08.095
General Arnold telling me this, and the 
ambassador also reaffirming it to me, and even

23:56.022 --> 24:08.095
General

24:10.758 --> 24:13.341
We had three missions from the Air Force 
viewpoint. One was to try to open up new air

24:15.584 --> 24:39.111
transport command aerial routes into Moscow from 
up around the north, from England to Murmansk,

24:15.584 --> 24:39.111
then down into Leningrad and Moscow, and from the 
south up through Cairo across to Tehran and up

24:15.584 --> 24:39.111
through Vladivostok into Moscow. And also from 
the east, from across the United States up through

24:43.268 --> 24:59.448
Canada, Alaska, and across the Siberian area, 
which was really a challenging task, to open up air

24:43.268 --> 24:59.448
routes across there and use them more freely. The 
main thing, use them more freely. And I put that in

25:02.832 --> 25:06.096
quotation marks. Then the second was to... 
develop and generate a freer exchange of weather

25:10.462 --> 25:37.920
information and the primary purpose of this of 
course was for the far east operation against

25:10.462 --> 25:37.920
japan because we needed weather reports for 
weather forecasts we needed the weather reports

25:10.462 --> 25:37.920
from the siberian outposts west of japan in order 
to make a valid forecast for particularly the wind

25:10.462 --> 25:37.920
the law You know, in our bombings of Japan is when we 
first learned about the so-called high altitude

25:38.407 --> 25:46.294
jet streams. It got as high as 200 miles an hour, you 
know, at times. And this is the first time that we

25:50.897 --> 25:55.181
ran into these high altitude operations. And we 
need more information for this. Sure. And the

25:58.744 --> 26:08.312
third objective, of course, and which was by far 
the most important, was to develop some shuttle

25:58.744 --> 26:08.312
bases for the bombers in the ukraine area of russia 
where we could fly across germany from either

26:09.170 --> 26:32.477
italy the 15th air force area or europe the eighth 
air force area with their b-17 b-24 bomb and land

26:09.170 --> 26:32.477
and recover in the shuttle bases in russia bomb up 
again and go back and of course it would be

26:33.520 --> 26:43.811
continuous 24-hour operations and at the outset 
it would only be American bombers, B-24s and

26:33.520 --> 26:43.811
B-17s. And initially only B-17s from the 8th Air 
Force. Did you have particular areas in the

26:50.118 --> 26:52.741
Ukraine that you wanted? Yes. I was briefed on all 
of this. Every briefing that the Ambassador was

26:57.866 --> 27:03.072
given with respect to the Air Force I always 
attended. And also General Vandenberg also

27:03.608 --> 27:07.492
attended. And when we first went over, if I 
remember correctly, I think it was,

27:08.133 --> 27:18.925
unfortunately, here again, I didn't keep a diary 
of my business in Moscow. I sure wish I had. But I

27:20.967 --> 27:29.597
think it was

27:20.967 --> 27:29.597
about the middle of September that we took off for 
Russia. And it was for the whole conference. We

27:32.347 --> 27:35.491
know it now as the Hull Conference. At that time, 
Secretary Hull was Secretary of State Cordell

27:35.511 --> 27:38.874
Hull. And we took off from National Airport at 
Washington, D.C. The ambassador traveled with

27:46.403 --> 28:01.780
Secretary Hull on that mission, but I took off in my 
converted B-24, we called it a C-87, with my crew,

27:46.403 --> 28:01.780
and heavily loaded with a lot of... of 
communication equipment and two or three army

28:02.418 --> 28:24.270
officers from the, I think it was called the Army 
Security Service at that time, which would be the

28:02.418 --> 28:24.270
secure communication equipment that would be 
installed for the ambassador's use, assuming the

28:02.418 --> 28:24.270
Russians would let us do this. And that was going to 
be one of the things that Mr. Hull would establish

28:27.074 --> 28:31.480
with Mr. Stalin. permit us to have our own 
communications. You know, diplomatic. Sure. And

28:38.302 --> 28:45.529
we made the flight by way of

28:38.302 --> 28:45.529
Europe. So Holvo and Harriman did not go in your 
airport? No. I was to meet you. And you left in

28:52.216 --> 28:53.878
October of 43. September. September. Around 
September of 43. OK. After about two months of

28:58.343 --> 29:02.547
conferences, In England, we had a lot of 
briefings. Oh, I mean, at the Pentagon, and

29:05.346 --> 29:11.533
getting to meet Harriman and everything, and 
getting the plane ready took about two months.

29:11.653 --> 29:14.456
Briefings and all, and getting the airplane 
ready. And it was very hectic. Now, you started out

29:16.739 --> 29:22.486
talking about Harriman, and you sort of described 
him. I'd like to know a little bit more about him.

29:28.693 --> 29:32.618
You said he was a soft-spoken man, but you never 
really described his character, or would you I

29:33.020 --> 29:43.974
never really knew much about him at that time 
except what I had read about him or seen, but my

29:33.020 --> 29:43.974
personal observations immediately were those I 
had just given you. And of course I learned to know

29:44.455 --> 29:47.299
him much better later on. After you were with him 
for over a year, how did your evaluation change? My

29:53.346 --> 29:57.912
initial evaluation didn't change very much. As a 
matter of fact, I learned more of his

29:58.033 --> 30:02.158
characteristics. He was a extremely hard worker. 
He worked morning, noon, and night. Many times I

30:09.629 --> 30:24.684
would be called over to the embassy, say around 
eight o'clock in the morning, and he would still be

30:09.629 --> 30:24.684
lying in bed with papers all over the bed, still in 
pajamas, maybe in his breakfast tray next to the

30:09.629 --> 30:24.684
bedside. He hadn't gotten out of bed yet, and he'd 
probably been working three or four hours. His

30:31.010 --> 30:33.553
aide and interpreter a Navy lieutenant. He, I tell 
you, I don't see how he kept the pace he did. I've

30:44.119 --> 30:45.861
seen him when he was- Do you know his name? Do you 
remember his name? I think his name was, I'm not

30:46.542 --> 30:53.552
going to say York, it was another Navy commander. I 
can't remember his name.

30:59.386 --> 31:05.916
There's a book written by General Dean called A 
Strange Alliance, where his name would be in it.

31:05.936 --> 31:09.200
Very fine book, but I don't see how he kept the pace 
he did. Harriman was a very demanding man to work

31:10.002 --> 31:13.006
for. I never, he was, to me, he was just I made me tell 
Tri, I've got to make a flight to go down to

31:19.248 --> 31:27.043
so-and-so, and said, you take care of this, and I'd 
like to leave about 8 or 9 o'clock or something like

31:19.248 --> 31:27.043
that. Let me know the takeoff time. That's all I 
need to know. And then

31:30.610 --> 31:35.139
you were laid on for me. That's about all he'd tell 
me. And every once in a while, I didn't The more I got

31:39.532 --> 31:42.055
to know him, maybe he would add a few comments. I 
want to go down and I want to meet and talk with

31:42.115 --> 31:48.562
so-and-so, and I've got to get this done, and 
something like that. He'd clue me in a little bit

31:48.622 --> 31:50.424
more. But never more than it was necessary just to 
make me feel as part of the team. So it did make you

31:58.974 --> 32:00.856
feel part of the team? Oh, definitely, 
definitely. And we took, immediately, we took a

32:02.438 --> 32:06.403
license to one another. He had a great respect for 
me. And he knew my background with Chenault, and

32:08.742 --> 32:14.748
particularly my combat record. And quite often on 
the airplane sometime, we'd be sitting and

32:14.888 --> 32:20.834
talking, just discussion. And he'd tell me, get me 
to tell him some of my experiences. And very

32:26.080 --> 32:27.701
interested in it. And he had a healthy respect for 
Chenault. He considered Chenault quite a hero,

32:29.783 --> 32:33.847
and obviously felt the same way about me. And I knew 
he liked me. And as a result, it was easy for me to

32:39.067 --> 32:41.510
like him. We had a great respect for one another. I 
had seen him get mad. I'd seen him pace the floor and

32:48.260 --> 32:54.889
actually say to me that this man Molotov, he's 
crazy. Crazy. And he realized he was telling me

32:58.213 --> 33:05.884
then some of the problems he had in his relations 
with the Russians and... And he would say, now try

33:06.539 --> 33:09.183
this, it doesn't involve you. He said, it doesn't 
involve you. And in other words, forget what I'm

33:10.545 --> 33:14.992
talking about. But he was so upset, he was walking 
back and forth across the floor as a result of a

33:15.053 --> 33:22.244
meeting he had had with Mr. Molotov. That's what 
he'd say, he's crazy. Well, obviously, Molotov

33:23.954 --> 33:28.940
didn't agree with him, or his demands were just 
outrageous. I didn't know what the subject was

33:29.341 --> 33:31.363
either. All I know is that Herrmann was very upset 
and very disappointed with the discussion he had

33:31.383 --> 33:38.072
had with Molotov on some problem. And was this 
typical? I mean, after conversations with

33:41.556 --> 33:44.440
Molotov? This was the only time I've seen Mr. 
Herrmann visibly upset. But I do know from stories

33:51.848 --> 34:00.417
and others that he had rough meetings with the 
Russians. And this goes back to what I was going to

34:00.717 --> 34:11.247
tell you this morning, their demanding, arrogant 
attitude about things that they wanted. They

34:11.648 --> 34:17.974
didn't want things, they demanded things in the 
area of Lend-Lease aircraft supplies. And so many

34:18.477 --> 34:24.303
supplies we gave them that we saw in a field later on 
were just wasted. We gave them so much that they

34:24.743 --> 34:28.507
couldn't use it. In one case, I think- Well, we'll 
talk about that when you go out on the field. And

34:33.232 --> 34:37.236
when you look at- we'll talk about that when you go 
out. But why didn't Harriman take his wife? Did he

34:40.119 --> 34:41.060
ever tell you? Yes, she had a very bad eye problem. I 
think it was glaucoma. I'm not sure. She had very

34:46.766 --> 34:48.147
bad- very poor eyesight, and

34:48.447 --> 34:59.722
she had to have constant medical care, and 
apparently she couldn't get it in Russia. How

34:59.742 --> 35:05.129
often would he go home, back to the States? And you 
always flown, of course. I don't think, I don't

35:08.093 --> 35:12.880
remember coming back home on one single trip. He 
had 13 months. He may have gone home on one trip by

35:15.059 --> 35:21.305
other means, but I'd get him down to Cairo. My job 
was to get him in and out of Cairo. Matter of fact, we

35:24.328 --> 35:30.093
did not, I don't believe Ann Bester ever made a trip 
back to the United States. I don't even remember us

35:30.113 --> 35:33.356
making a trip to England. We went down to Cairo and 
Tehran for several conferences. Now, when you

35:37.200 --> 35:41.944
flew down to these places, would he ever come up in 
the cockpit? No, no. I'd go back and talk to him. You

35:46.317 --> 35:55.229
know, the flight from Moscow down to Tehran is 
around, I think, about four or five hours, four and

35:46.317 --> 35:55.229
a half hours, something like that. Around four 
hours. Then the flight from there to Tehran to

35:56.912 --> 36:02.139
Cairo is a few hours. And we had time to talk.

36:08.127 --> 36:08.888
Small talk. Every once in a while we'd talk about 
the Russians. He'd ask me what I think, you know,

36:12.468 --> 36:18.314
about the men I'd met, you know, and what did you 
tell him? He was never surprised at the things I'd

36:20.336 --> 36:22.818
tell him. I had a respect for the Russians in a great 
way, their dedication to their service, their

36:23.299 --> 36:38.854
competence, but I'm sure I used the word arrogant 
many, many, many times, and he knew what I was

36:23.299 --> 36:38.854
getting at. I'm sure that his discussion was 
Molotov and even Stalin. I'm sure, well I say I'm

36:45.860 --> 36:58.513
sure, I'm really sure that the nature of the 
discussions, of the air around the discussion was

36:45.860 --> 36:58.513
the same as it was for me at my level and in 
particular General Vandenberg. Initially

36:59.374 --> 37:09.745
General Vandenberg attended all these meetings 
and I forgot to tell you that they were holding one

36:59.374 --> 37:09.745
decision in advance until, depending on how the 
conferences went, the whole discussion with

37:10.383 --> 37:37.437
Darlene, how open they thought back in Washington 
that the Russians would be with us and how free our

37:10.383 --> 37:37.437
communications would be with one another as to 
whether it was worthwhile for General

37:10.383 --> 37:37.437
Vandenberg, a general, to stay in Russia, or me, 
lieutenant colonel whom they knew and planned to

37:37.923 --> 37:42.508
promote to full colonel. And obviously they must 
have made the decision that, well, we just don't

37:42.528 --> 37:52.077
think that it's worthwhile to keep General 
Vandenberg over there. And of course they had

37:52.097 --> 38:04.470
plans for General Vandenberg and a very great 
career back home also, being one of General

37:52.097 --> 38:04.470
Arnold's white haired boys and a very fine 
officer. So at least they felt that Colonel I,

38:04.788 --> 38:10.655
Charlie Bond, could do the job for the time being, 
and of course everybody agreed to this. So that's

38:10.716 --> 38:13.099
the reason General Vandenberg went on the back. 
And then in the invasion of North Africa, if you

38:13.239 --> 38:19.166
remember, General Vandenberg got a key job in air 
power. He and Doolittle and North Africa. Yeah,

38:22.431 --> 38:23.592
absolutely. Yes, the ambassador and I talked many 
times, and we came very close. He called me

38:30.681 --> 38:33.485
Charlie, and I would always address him, Mr. 
Ambassador. I had a very healthy respect for him. I

38:39.175 --> 38:40.937
wondered at times about his health. He always 
walked in a stooped, with his shoulders sort of a

38:41.057 --> 38:47.343
stooped attitude. But as far as being sharp, 
mentally sharp, I thought he was terrific. He

38:56.152 --> 39:02.959
never spoke openly to me about

39:03.682 --> 39:06.706
the details of, let's say, a personal discussion 
with Starling. I've heard him discuss... Did you

39:07.988 --> 39:12.254
ever ask him what kind of man is Starling? Oh, yes. 
As a matter of fact, we, you know, this is the kind of

39:12.695 --> 39:18.583
question we're always asking each other. I felt 
free to ask, what do you think of Mr. Starling and

39:18.603 --> 39:21.868
Mr. Molotov? And he'd give me, there were never 
answers that were, showed that there was a obvious

39:31.070 --> 39:40.819
dislike for any of them, but on the other hand, it 
was very obvious to me that it wasn't an answer that

39:31.070 --> 39:40.819
indicated he thought they were terrific people. I 
knew he was having problems, and I knew he was

39:42.701 --> 39:47.265
having, you know, even discussion problems. They 
were very demanding people, and I had an idea that

39:47.285 --> 39:54.532
his discussions with them at times were 
difficult. How did he answer when you asked him

39:54.933 --> 39:59.197
what kind of man is Stalin? Do you remember? No, I 
don't remember exactly, except that he indicated

40:01.715 --> 40:18.339
that he was, you know, a very dedicated

40:01.715 --> 40:18.339
great man, that type of thing, and had a great, 
terrific responsibility and a terrific job.

40:19.781 --> 40:28.313
Never anything about a horrible communist, never 
anything indicating that, never anything about

40:19.781 --> 40:28.313
a... dictator who was killing people, you know, 
never anything like that. I don't ever recall him

40:34.654 --> 40:46.769
making a comment, really, about a Russian leader 
that, except that time I was telling you about

40:34.654 --> 40:46.769
Molotov, when he walked back and forth and he was 
obviously dissatisfied. But that's the only time

40:47.990 --> 40:56.781
that you ever remember him making a negative 
comment about a Russian leader, even though he was

40:47.990 --> 40:56.781
going through these torturous negotiations. He 
must have had a tremendous amount of control. He

41:00.251 --> 41:02.013
did, with no doubt in my mind. And I'm sure that's 
one of the reasons he selected the job. Because of

41:05.216 --> 41:15.368
his dealings, I think it was over magnesium, 
business dealings in previous years with Russia.

41:16.229 --> 41:19.592
He had been to Russia before and was a businessman. 
Of course, he was a diplomat, and I think that's one

41:20.053 --> 41:26.700
of the reasons he was chosen by President 
Roosevelt. Did

41:27.305 --> 41:32.792
Harriman ever make any statements about 
Roosevelt?

41:38.500 --> 41:55.303
I don't remember any particular statement, but I 
do know there was a terrific mutual respect there

41:38.500 --> 41:55.303
between the two men, and one thing, Harriman and I 
was, you know, I was privy to the diplomat cables

41:38.500 --> 41:55.303
coming back and forth, Mr. Herman never wasted any 
time writing to Hull, the Secretary of State. His

42:00.158 --> 42:03.682
bars were always to President Roosevelt. Direct 
and no doubt who he worked with.

42:10.130 --> 42:12.012
Did you get to read the cables? Many of them I did. 
Not all of them, of course. But anything

42:14.455 --> 42:17.739
pertaining particularly to the Air Force was a 
problem. I was head of the Air Division. There was a

42:20.082 --> 42:23.907
Navy Division, Air, Army, and then Lease. Navy 
Commander had the Naval Division, I had the Air

42:24.646 --> 42:42.262
Force Division, Army Brigadier General had the 
Army Division, and a, I think a two-star general,

42:24.646 --> 42:42.262
Army Commander, had the Land Legion Division. And 
we worked under General Dean, Gus Dean. Yeah. And I

42:46.606 --> 42:54.653
was wondering about how did the different 
services, the different branches of the embassy

42:55.223 --> 42:57.906
How well did they work and cooperate on their 
heroine? Very well, very well. Matter of fact, I

43:00.409 --> 43:10.560
don't ever remember having any

43:00.409 --> 43:10.560
problems from the standpoint of coordination 
between the services. There were just no type of

43:12.583 --> 43:18.249
problem like that that would have to come up 
because we weren't involved in tactics. You know,

43:18.269 --> 43:19.771
we weren't fighting combat. The Navy had their 
supply functions to supply,

43:24.805 --> 43:34.058
in other words, give supplies and get supplies to 
Russia by the way of Murmansk and Vladivostok. And

43:35.200 --> 43:42.730
by the way, the chief coordinator for the weather 
objective, the weather exchange, was a Navy

43:35.200 --> 43:42.730
commander. And that, by the way, turned out very 
well. They cooperated. Well, we're going to talk

43:49.219 --> 43:52.684
about all those three things that you wanted to try 
to accomplish. There was no problems. But as far

43:53.866 --> 43:54.627
as... Okay. Now, Dean was in charge. He was sort of 
the chief of staff. He was the head of the U.S.

44:00.619 --> 44:03.542
Military Mission in Russia. Okay. Tell me about 
General Dean. General Dean was a very fine

44:05.884 --> 44:08.266
officer. I have the utmost respect and admiration 
for him. He had a hard job. He was very much the

44:13.612 --> 44:20.138
personality of Mr. Harriman. Easygoing, 
soft-spoken, wore heavy, very heavy spectacles,

44:22.855 --> 44:34.249
and

44:22.855 --> 44:34.249
had a very keen sense of humor.

44:39.496 --> 44:43.481
I don't know the basic arm that he was trained in in 
the Army. He was a major general at the time,

44:43.922 --> 44:52.272
but he He was a fine diplomatic type. He was a 
perfect man for that job. I've seen him many, many

45:01.786 --> 45:09.475
more times than I did the Mr. Herman be angry and 
upset. And of course we talked. I had the chance to

45:13.420 --> 45:20.628
talk to him more than I did the Ambassador because 
my office was in his office.

45:23.471 --> 45:24.132
He had

45:26.997 --> 45:30.381
He had a healthy respect for the Russians.

45:32.043 --> 45:39.612
Of course, many of the things I believe about the 
Russians, you know, stem from our continual

45:32.043 --> 45:39.612
relations and discussions. Many of my feelings, 
or his feelings, may very well be that he learned

45:40.914 --> 45:47.041
some things from me. You know, I would continue to 
tell him about my relations with the Russians.

45:49.785 --> 45:51.807
Well, what did he have to say about his?

45:55.010 --> 46:15.448
Looking back and sort of recapping general 
feelings about the Russians, he

45:55.010 --> 46:15.448
respected their combat capability and their

45:55.010 --> 46:15.448
dedication to the war effort.

46:20.862 --> 46:50.380
he thought of them in terms of and so did I and we 
actually saw this on a field visit to the front

46:20.862 --> 46:50.380
which I had several rather primitive in their 
efforts of supply and

46:20.862 --> 46:50.380
organization but nevertheless and I emphasize 
this nevertheless very effective in combat

46:20.862 --> 46:50.380
because they to quote their statement. We killed 
Germans. We killed Germans.

46:59.015 --> 47:04.761
In that respect, we had a great deal of admiration 
and respect for the Russians. I should think that,

47:05.441 --> 47:10.106
of course, they were fighting on their own soil. 
This made quite a difference. Can you imagine

47:13.329 --> 47:18.173
visiting Americans fighting, let's say, on 
caught in the United States someplace, an

47:18.710 --> 47:22.977
invader, can you imagine the spirit that you would 
see there? Well, this is what we saw in Russia.

47:28.185 --> 47:39.823
In spite of that, however, I still say that a war 
between Russia and the United States and actually

47:28.185 --> 47:39.823
locked in combat on ground, sea, or air.
