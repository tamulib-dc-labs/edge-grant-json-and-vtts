WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:05.315
team, the people we were visiting called in the 
inspection team. But officially, it was a staff

00:05.335 --> 00:08.319
assistance visit team. OK. Today is, what is it, 
the 26th?

00:15.648 --> 00:17.871
Didn't even look at the calendar, for heaven's 
sakes. 23rd. OK, 23rd. This is the third interview

00:20.394 --> 00:23.979
with General Cargill. We talked last time about 
what he felt was the period in his career in which He

00:32.380 --> 00:35.243
had the largest contribution to the service. And 
now I'd like to turn it around and ask if there was a

00:36.123 --> 00:50.456
period in your military career in which you felt 
that you didn't have much of a contribution, or

00:36.123 --> 00:50.456
maybe you could have done something, but you 
couldn't, for some reason, get it through. You

00:50.496 --> 00:53.119
couldn't be effective, maybe a shortcoming. I 
would say that the time of least effectiveness for

00:55.101 --> 01:00.025
me as far as being a reservist, and I think this is 
probably true of most people in the program at that

01:00.950 --> 01:16.226
time, was the period in which we had no equipment 
and no real wartime mission, so to speak. The days

01:16.787 --> 01:19.730
of what we called the Little Red Schoolhouse days. 
That's when we would meet in the basement of the old

01:19.750 --> 01:29.320
post office down in Bryan and watch old World War II 
and pre-World War II films. would take

01:30.076 --> 01:33.942
correspondence courses and work bills and so 
forth. But as far as being prepared to go to war and

01:34.803 --> 01:43.416
fulfill a specific wartime mission, we had none. 
We had no preparation for that. About all we had to

01:45.600 --> 01:59.020
offer was maybe some past active duty experience 
and probably a little bit better than average

01:45.600 --> 01:59.020
familiarization with world conditions, with our 
military objectives and what have you. But not

02:00.990 --> 02:02.232
much more than that. You take almost a man off the 
street that was well read on current events would

02:03.013 --> 02:12.608
probably have as much ability to perform a service 
then as we had as reservists. But that that was when

02:13.710 --> 02:17.716
I considered the program to be at rock bottom. And 
then as I've mentioned in earlier conversations,

02:19.078 --> 02:23.505
it got better and better and better until the day 
Not only do we have wartime missions, but we have

02:24.110 --> 02:30.498
brand new equipment in many cases right off the 
assembly line to perform those wartime missions.

02:31.259 --> 02:36.184
So it's gone from absolute depths to what I feel is 
the best of all worlds. So from the 50s to the 80s.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.889
That's pretty well the time frame. That's not to 
say we have everything we need in the way of

02:40.189 --> 02:49.240
equipment and funding, but I would say the things 
that we need are in probably the approximate

02:49.456 --> 02:52.759
proportions is the thing that the active duty 
establishment needs. In other words, we're

02:52.959 --> 02:59.966
getting our fair share of the assets from DOD.

03:00.667 --> 03:04.611
What secretaries of defense do you think were most 
responsible for this upgrading?

03:07.114 --> 03:13.220
At that time, I was so far down on the totem pole that 
I didn't even know who the secretary of defense was

03:07.114 --> 03:13.220
for the most part. I do feel that Secretary of 
Defense Robert McNamara had more to do with the

03:16.726 --> 03:24.894
degradation of the military establishment than 
any Secretary of Defense that pops in my mind. We

03:25.494 --> 03:29.298
called him Mac the Knife because he was cutting 
funds for this, cutting funds for that. We didn't

03:29.338 --> 03:30.079
need this. We didn't need that. And during his 
administration, the defense establishment

03:31.680 --> 03:36.124
deteriorated drastically in this country. I 
think our present Secretary of Defense, Casper

03:37.065 --> 03:42.691
Weinberger, is just absolutely tops. Can't say 
enough good things about him. He fights hard for

03:45.110 --> 03:47.412
what we need. I would say that those would be the two 
extremes. The rest of them would be a shady grade

03:52.077 --> 03:54.600
between the two. Now let's talk about a couple of 
those

03:55.161 --> 04:05.031
weapon systems that have been very controversial 
for the last few years. And I'd just like your

04:05.292 --> 04:07.854
opinion on how you stand. What about the B-1 
bomber? We should have had it years ago. However,

04:13.460 --> 04:17.064
In the delay, there's always a silver lining to 
every cloud, I guess. The fact that some

04:17.104 --> 04:35.766
technological advances were made during the time 
the B-1 was on hold and was being delayed so that the

04:17.104 --> 04:35.766
B-1 we have, when it comes off the assembly line, 
will be a better weapon system than the B-1 that

04:17.104 --> 04:35.766
would have come off had Jimmy Carter and others not 
postponed it. So there may be some blessings

04:36.527 --> 04:39.290
involved there. But the B-52... Well, you can go to 
Davis-Monthan, the boneyard of the Air Force

04:42.502 --> 04:48.588
Base, and you'll see acres of B-52s. More going on 
all the time. So we've not replaced those B-52s

04:52.992 --> 05:04.343
that have worn out, and those that are still 
flying, for the most part, are much older than any

04:52.992 --> 05:04.343
of the crew members on board flying them. They were 
built and were flying before any of those people

05:04.783 --> 05:07.526
were born. And, you know, things change. You can 
say, well, you can just patch an old car so long.

05:13.178 --> 05:16.481
Well, if you keep spending the right kind of money 
on it, you can keep it going indefinitely, I guess.

05:17.262 --> 05:24.870
But there's no question in my mind that the B-1 is 
overdue and desperately needed by this country.

05:25.210 --> 05:39.745
OK, I was reading Jimmy Carter's memoirs, and in 
that, in keeping faith, and in that, he says that he

05:25.210 --> 05:39.745
decided to veto the B-1 because of the crew's 
missile system. And we could drop the crews out of

05:40.720 --> 05:45.888
the B-52. And so we could modify in that sense. And 
he also says that the effectiveness of a bomber

05:48.572 --> 06:00.511
trying to get into the Soviet Union would be almost 
a suicide mission for any pilot. How would you

06:00.531 --> 06:02.374
respond to that? Not being an operational type, I 
really couldn't address those points at all. That

06:08.578 --> 06:11.822
would really take someone involved in the flying 
end of the thing. As I mentioned to you earlier, I'm

06:11.842 --> 06:13.985
not a rated pilot. I've never done any flying. I've 
never studied operational tactics. So I would

06:18.330 --> 06:27.501
just have to comment generally that

06:18.330 --> 06:27.501
since a manned bomber is the only A fail-safe 
device we've got, once you send a manned bomber on a

06:28.544 --> 06:37.896
mission, you can always recall it, but you can't 
recall a missile once you push the button. I would

06:38.597 --> 06:46.447
say that I would think our chances would be much 
better in a B-1 than in a B-52 if we had to go to war.

06:47.248 --> 06:57.842
And I think we owe it to our military people and to 
our own country that we need to have the best odds

06:47.248 --> 06:57.842
that we've got, even though they may not be good 
odds, they'd still be the better odds than we have

06:47.248 --> 06:57.842
with a B-52. I'm not so sure that Carter's 
assumption that we can't make it to a target in a

06:58.970 --> 07:10.102
manned bomber is a good assumption. Our planners 
apparently think we can, or they wouldn't be

07:11.003 --> 07:15.848
building it. Okay, I want to ask you about another 
system, and that's the missiles, the MX missile.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.497
I'd like your opinion on that. Should we deploy 
them? I think a lot of it depends on the Russians. I

07:28.150 --> 07:43.428
think a lot of it depends on the Pershing cruise 
missiles, the Glickhams ground launch cruise

07:28.150 --> 07:43.428
missiles and the Alchems air launch and different 
things and what effect they have, if any, on the

07:28.150 --> 07:43.428
talks in Geneva. I think there's still a remote 
possibility that the MX, we may not have to deploy

07:43.448 --> 07:55.082
the MX. The ALCOMs and the GLICOMs and so forth, 
SLICOMs for sea launch. They've got all kinds of

08:00.907 --> 08:02.209
acronyms. You've got to learn a whole new language 
to talk to these people. But anyway, if those have

08:05.354 --> 08:18.334
the effect that I think they might have, it may be 
that we may be able to either delay or cut back on the

08:05.354 --> 08:18.334
scope of the MX. I think we're always going to need 
some long-range ballistic missile capability. I

08:24.644 --> 08:36.686
think to answer the question, yes, we need the MX, 
but I'm not sure we need it in the magnitude and in

08:24.644 --> 08:36.686
the scope that probably has been envisioned. And 
all that depends on what reaction we get from the

08:36.706 --> 08:41.875
Russians on our cruise missiles. Okay. Speaking 
of the Russians, I'd like your opinion on the SALT

08:43.057 --> 08:49.268
talks, which, of course... Republican and 
Democratic presidents supported until Mr.

08:49.687 --> 08:57.496
Reagan and then he started the START talks. What 
was your feeling on the SALT agreement? I felt you

09:02.943 --> 09:11.533
could put the same amount of reliance on that as 
well as on any other agreements we've ever signed

09:02.943 --> 09:11.533
with Russia. And that is that they will honor it 
only when it's to their advantage to do so. I don't

09:16.479 --> 09:18.141
think it's worth the paper it's written on. That's 
not to say I don't think it's worth the effort. I

09:20.695 --> 09:22.177
think we need to continue the effort. I think we 
need to reach all the agreements we can on

09:22.417 --> 09:27.344
limiting. The verifiable portion of the thing is 
extremely important. But as far as a treaty being

09:33.993 --> 09:46.390
something we can say, hey, we've got a treaty, we 
can sit back and relax now, I think that that's, you

09:33.993 --> 09:46.390
know, even a man on the street that's not familiar 
with the situation would know you can't do that. So

09:47.568 --> 09:51.232
I think that, yes, we should pursue the treaty 
talks. And yes, we should get the best deal we can.

09:53.054 --> 09:54.996
We should get it in writing, get everybody's 
agreement. And we should live up to our end of the

09:55.857 --> 09:59.481
treaty and then see to it that they live up to their 
end. But by the same token, if they don't, then we

10:00.162 --> 10:03.525
need some fallback position. We need to assume 
they're not going to honor the treaty. We need to

10:06.769 --> 10:08.290
make that basic assumption. And it's a good 
assumption. History's proven that. So that's my

10:11.754 --> 10:15.398
feeling on that.

10:18.010 --> 10:24.521
turn now to the role of leadership and the issue of 
leadership at A&M. We pride ourselves on

10:24.561 --> 10:38.625
developing leaders and therefore I'd like to ask 
you, a leader both in the business and in the

10:24.561 --> 10:38.625
military field, what are the qualities, what are 
the values that make a good leader? I think first of

10:40.248 --> 10:42.532
all you have to have average intelligence. I don't 
I don't feel that it's necessary to have an

10:43.458 --> 10:46.162
extremely high IQ. In fact, in some cases, that 
might be a disadvantage. But I think an average

10:49.326 --> 11:10.275
person with an average intelligence that's been 
trained from early childhood in the importance of

10:49.326 --> 11:10.275
self-reliance and the old Boy Scout law of all the 
trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly,

10:49.326 --> 11:10.275
courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, 
brave, clean, reverent type things, all those are

11:10.542 --> 11:16.690
You know, they may get to be almost rote, but still 
each one of them individually is very important in

11:10.542 --> 11:16.690
developing leadership. I think you have to 
develop a pretty high degree of self-reliance,

11:17.851 --> 11:25.361
and I think that's done only through experiencing 
a certain amount of adversity. I think that if you

11:26.322 --> 11:36.955
don't have hardships and trials and tribulations 
that come along in smaller doses as you're young

11:26.322 --> 11:36.955
and it gets larger and larger as you grow, If you're 
shielded from those, either by parents, peers, or

11:38.521 --> 11:46.333
what have you, it's much of a disservice. Because 
in later life, when you are thrust in a leadership

11:46.533 --> 11:59.352
position and you do find yourself in a position of 
adversity, then you're not equipped to handle it.

11:59.372 --> 12:01.856
But I feel that A&M does that. I think that the 
student body, the discipline that we talked about

12:02.016 --> 12:06.503
earlier in the core, by its very nature, imposes a 
certain amount of uneasiness. It's the grain of

12:13.126 --> 12:15.930
sand and the oyster that develops into a pearl. 
It's an abrasive process. I think those are very

12:20.476 --> 12:21.578
important. I think we have that here at A&M. I think 
we try to develop that through giving people an

12:23.260 --> 12:29.549
opportunity to run for student office. It's not a 
pleasant thing to run for the student senate. It's

12:34.799 --> 12:38.583
a lot of hard work, and you take a lot of knocks, but 
it's a growing process. And those that adapt to it

12:39.884 --> 12:51.496
and realize that that's part of the price they pay 
for being a leader and are willing to pay that

12:39.884 --> 12:51.496
price, well, then those things follow most of 
their life. If you had to go back, I want to ask a

12:52.838 --> 12:55.300
similar question now. If you had to go back to the 
Corps and they wanted you to give them a lecture on

12:55.320 --> 13:02.848
how to become a leader, what would you tell them? I 
would tell them pretty well some of the things that

13:04.769 --> 13:24.130
I just told you there, plus the fact that I would try 
to emphasize to them to force themselves to accept

13:04.769 --> 13:24.130
positions of responsibility or to do actions 
which are responsible actions, even though it may

13:04.769 --> 13:24.130
be uncomfortable at the time. They may not want to 
go out on a fundraising drive for the Boy Scouts, or

13:25.151 --> 13:34.000
they may not want to get involved with some of the 
The civic service type of activities are

13:34.756 --> 13:40.405
available to some of our students. But they need to 
force themselves to do that, even though it would

13:40.425 --> 13:47.736
be much more pleasant to get a six pack and go to the 
river fishing with the guys. It's the old idea of

13:47.876 --> 13:52.143
learn to do by doing. You learn to be a leader by 
being a leader. And there are lots of

13:54.166 --> 14:03.160
opportunities on this campus and in life in 
general for people to place themselves in

13:54.166 --> 14:03.160
leadership roles. We hear the expression all the 
time in all kinds of meetings, do we have any

14:04.608 --> 14:08.231
volunteers for this? Or would someone volunteer 
to do this, that, or the other? Volunteer. Get

14:11.274 --> 14:11.814
involved. Be part of it. Do something. And those 
little experiences continue to grow, and they

14:14.057 --> 14:23.085
develop a mindset that will follow you most of your 
life. So I would advise them to get very active in

14:23.885 --> 14:29.691
core activities, in student activities, and in 
classroom activities. Join every club they can

14:29.711 --> 14:32.453
find to join that they're eligible for. Run for 
office. responsibility and then they'll be a

14:34.882 --> 14:58.847
leader I was wondering if there's a difference 
between a business leader or a university leader

14:34.882 --> 14:58.847
or a military leader is there a difference in the 
way that those two types of people lead you're in a

14:34.882 --> 14:58.847
unique situation here so you should be yeah I think 
that to answer your question, I don't think

14:59.941 --> 15:04.007
there's a dime's worth of difference in 
leadership in any of those. I think that it all goes

15:04.488 --> 15:08.654
back to some very basic principles that a lot of 
times we forget. Things that you learn in

15:10.696 --> 15:20.250
management 101, the importance of unity of 
command, having one boss, one guy that can make a

15:10.696 --> 15:20.250
decision and then take the heat if it's necessary 
for him to take it. Span of control, not having too

15:20.270 --> 15:22.794
many people working for him. Homogeneous 
assignment, getting people to giving people work

15:26.300 --> 15:35.832
to do that's of a like nature so that you don't ask 
him to do one thing and then the next minute you ask

15:26.300 --> 15:35.832
him to do something that he's not really qualified 
to do. Delegation of authority, I say, probably is

15:38.496 --> 15:51.733
the most important thing that a leader needs to 
develop in any of these arenas that you're talking

15:38.496 --> 15:51.733
about, whether it be military, civic, 
legislative, business, education, whatever. A

15:52.523 --> 15:57.107
leader just does not have enough time during the 
day to do all he needs to do. So you get your work done

15:57.848 --> 16:01.311
through people. It comes down to what I like to 
refer to as my very favorite definition of

16:01.331 --> 16:06.216
management. How do you define management? Of 
course, that's one of the things that you always

16:07.357 --> 16:10.460
have in management classes. What is management? 
To me, management is defining and solving

16:13.062 --> 16:19.388
problems through the development and 
utilization of personnel. If you do the job

16:19.708 --> 16:21.450
yourself, You're not a manager. You do the job 
through other people. And to me, those basic

16:28.010 --> 16:31.595
things are true no matter what. Have you ever read 
the book by former Brigadier General Douglas

16:32.837 --> 16:40.610
Kennard entitled The War Managers? No. It deals 
with Vietnam, and he did a survey of the 180

16:41.073 --> 16:55.295
different generals who at one time were in 
Vietnam, and about 110 or so filled out the survey

16:41.073 --> 16:55.295
and sent it back to him. And he deals with this issue 
of managing the army versus leading the army, and

16:55.315 --> 17:03.047
he sees differences here. And of course, it could 
be managing the Air Force versus leading. And he

17:07.753 --> 17:22.391
feels that one of the main problems in Vietnam and 
in the service is that so many people have MBAs, and

17:07.753 --> 17:22.391
so many people are managers, and there aren't as 
many true leaders. Let's just go out and we've got

17:22.451 --> 17:25.354
to face the enemy now. How would you respond to 
that? Well, I would think that, of course, a lot of

17:27.557 --> 17:29.980
times, If you've got a crisis situation on your 
hands, then I get involved. I get on the telephone.

17:35.478 --> 17:37.720
I take care of things myself rather than delegate. 
I would think that when you're in a combat

17:38.321 --> 17:45.028
environment, it's very similar to me having a fire 
in the basement of the student center. When they

17:45.868 --> 17:50.894
call me up and tell me we've got a major fire in the 
basement of the student center, I don't think

17:45.868 --> 17:50.894
about delegating. I get on the phone. I carry a 
bunch of phone numbers in my billfold of people I

17:51.834 --> 17:56.459
need to contact to make things happen. I forget the 
chain of command, and I take care of the business.

18:00.487 --> 18:02.629
And I would think that's where you'd have to be in 
combat. But those situations probably occupy 1

18:03.710 --> 18:09.056
tenth of 1% of your time. The other 99.5% or 
whatever, then you can be a manager as opposed to a

18:09.096 --> 18:15.883
leader. I don't really differentiate that much 
between managership and leadership. I think

18:20.687 --> 18:22.449
they're almost synonymous terms.

18:25.092 --> 18:30.257
So I would say that in a life-threatening or a 
combat environment situation that that you'd

18:30.811 --> 18:38.143
have to throw some of your 101 rules out the window 
and do what the immediate situation called for,

18:30.811 --> 18:38.143
whatever it may be. Now, maybe this is part of 
military mythology, but we often see on

18:38.163 --> 18:52.347
television and in the movies the military leader 
as the patent type. let's kick him in the butt and

18:52.529 --> 18:56.154
go, guys, that kind of stuff. I've never met but one 
guy that kind of fits that pattern. He's retired,

18:59.399 --> 19:03.585
and he retired under adverse conditions named 
General Keegan. He used to be in charge of Air Force

19:03.605 --> 19:16.463
Intelligence Service, and he made a number of 
speeches and took a number of positions that were

19:03.605 --> 19:16.463
counter to policy at that time, and so basically he 
really got fired. Since then, he's been on a

19:17.104 --> 19:20.629
speaking tour, and I presume still is, of Anybody 
can get to listen to him about the Russian threat

19:21.048 --> 19:25.814
and so forth. He was a hellfire and brimstone 
patent type. I've never met any other general that

19:28.017 --> 19:29.899
was like that. So that's a myth, I think, for the 
most part. However, in a wartime situation, it may

19:36.307 --> 19:39.912
take something like that. And it's always good to 
have the ability to come unglued if you have to to

19:41.194 --> 19:45.299
get something done. But you just don't want to use 
it until it's really necessary. I think most of us

19:48.783 --> 19:50.025
have a boiling point. Some of us is lower than 
others and I think it should be a low point but I

19:51.694 --> 19:59.885
think all of us should have the ability to ball if 
the situation calls for it. Okay, let's turn to

20:00.105 --> 20:04.812
General Rutter. Did you know General Rutter? I 
knew him personally. Well, could you just

20:07.636 --> 20:13.404
describe him, the type of person that he was and 
your feelings toward him? He was all the things

20:14.065 --> 20:18.831
that I've talked about is what I think a leader 
should be. He was personable. He was friendly. He

20:23.831 --> 20:24.592
was tough. He was fair. He could be nasty if the 
situation really demanded it, but only if the

20:27.035 --> 20:32.182
situation really demanded it. He liked people. He 
liked folksy things. He liked to talk about some of

20:35.347 --> 20:38.712
his background, some of his experiences. He liked 
for things to be run on a business-like basis with

20:39.633 --> 20:44.700
black ink at the bottom of the page instead of red 
ink. He got a little bit more involved in some of the

20:45.693 --> 20:56.844
details of the university operation than 
probably he should have, but he did it not because

20:45.693 --> 20:56.844
he felt that others couldn't do it. He did it 
because he liked to do it. For example, when I was

20:59.227 --> 21:12.200
promoted, when I was hired as manager of the Texas 
A&M bookstore, I didn't get the offer until I

20:59.227 --> 21:12.200
personally went over and sat down for about an hour 
interview with General Rutter, and we talked. He

21:12.220 --> 21:14.502
said, what makes you think you can run that 
bookstore? And to me, it's a good job and a nice job

21:15.308 --> 21:29.547
and a big job, but it's not one where the president 
of the university would normally sit down with an

21:15.308 --> 21:29.547
hour interview and personally pass on the guy 
that's going to go in as the manager of the

21:15.308 --> 21:29.547
bookstore. That would be done certainly no higher 
than the vice presidential level and probably not

21:30.168 --> 21:36.096
even at that level in today's environment. Of 
course, at that time, the school was much smaller,

21:36.737 --> 21:41.323
so that might have had some bearing. But he used to 
really get involved in a lot of, personnel

21:45.127 --> 21:51.535
actions, especially for jobs where people were 
being hired to fill jobs, middle management and

21:45.127 --> 21:51.535
above. You didn't hire anybody on this campus 
without his personal blessings. And he wanted to

21:55.239 --> 21:57.822
interview people most of the time. But I'm not 
saying that that's a drawback. I'm just saying

22:01.186 --> 22:06.712
that in today's environment, with the numbers of 
people and the size of the university, you just

22:01.186 --> 22:06.712
couldn't do that. No. Well, just out of curiosity, 
what did you say to him? I said, you bet I can. I was

22:13.831 --> 22:16.816
very positive, and I think that's one of the things 
that got his attention. There was never any

22:17.337 --> 22:19.941
vacillation or hesitation on my part. Could I run 
the store? I'd, of course, been with Sears Roebuck

22:21.824 --> 22:30.858
for eight years, so I'd had a good, solid 
background in retail business and in a

22:21.824 --> 22:30.858
profit-making type situation. He had a great deal 
of respect for Sears, and I think my experience and

22:31.559 --> 22:40.193
the way I came across in the interview, 
apparently, was positive or I wouldn't have had

22:31.559 --> 22:40.193
the job. But he used to go out and circulate on the 
campus quite a bit. I know he came in to the

22:44.479 --> 22:50.886
bookstore for briefings periodically on our 
profit picture and how we were making things. And

22:50.986 --> 23:02.478
that's pretty low level for the president to take 
time to come out and sit down in the bookstore

22:50.986 --> 23:02.478
manager's office and let the manager tell you how 
things were going in the bookstore.

23:03.119 --> 23:04.481
But he was a dynamic guy. He had tremendous 
respect. And although I didn't know too much about

23:07.103 --> 23:10.467
this side of General Rutter, I understand that he 
probably had a better handle on how politics works

23:10.852 --> 23:21.142
and the power maneuvers that you need to make in 
Austin for budget purposes and so forth about as

23:10.852 --> 23:21.142
well as anybody ever has. Of course, being a state 
land commissioner for a long time, on the Austin

23:21.922 --> 23:27.748
scene, he knew how Austin worked. He knew which 
buttons to push to get the reaction that he wanted,

23:28.128 --> 23:32.913
and he didn't hesitate to push them. And I'm not 
saying that that's anything good, because we're a

23:34.414 --> 23:38.698
political organization. entity, and we can't 
ever forget that. You can paint a big state

23:42.666 --> 23:50.334
university, any color you want to paint it, it's 
still a political animal. And it thrives on

23:50.354 --> 23:53.637
appropriations. And appropriations are driven 
by politics, and politics is what he was a master

23:53.657 --> 23:58.963
at. He really knew how to play it. And he was a 
visionary. He had visions of this university

24:03.567 --> 24:09.073
doing pretty well what it has done. This complex 
we're in now was pretty well thought up and dreamed

24:09.728 --> 24:17.938
up and put into motion during his administration. 
And just a super guy. Very friendly. I always

24:24.185 --> 24:25.367
thought the world of him. I have a very close 
relationship with his widow, Mrs. Rutter. I see

24:29.051 --> 24:32.395
her frequently.

24:32.611 --> 24:44.026
But of course, during his administration, 
probably the most dynamic changes took place with

24:32.611 --> 24:44.026
the College of Texas A&M to the Texas A&M 
University. And I'd like to ask your opinion on

24:44.467 --> 24:47.431
some of these changes. What about as a former 
corpsman watching the end of the mandatory corps?

24:53.800 --> 24:54.901
How did you feel about that? I had mixed emotions.

25:01.990 --> 25:04.753
My heart told me no, and my head told me yes. That no, 
I hate to turn loose to the old ways of doing things.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.760
That is A&M to me. The core and A&M were synonymous 
terms at that time.

25:17.425 --> 25:20.128
But logic would tell you that it had to happen. And 
since it's happened, and since we've gotten used

25:21.109 --> 25:26.334
to it, there's no question that it was the 
appropriate thing to do. I think that three things

25:26.354 --> 25:30.158
have happened. that have brought A&M to the 
forefront. One is the name change that you've

25:33.968 --> 25:35.951
already alluded to. Second is the elimination of 
mandatory core. And third is the admission of

25:39.856 --> 25:41.980
females to the university. That's the next 
question. Without any one of those three things

25:43.922 --> 25:49.550
having happened, we wouldn't be in the enviable 
position we're in today.

25:52.655 --> 25:54.798
So did you feel about the same way about women? I 
would say, Rob, doing away with mandatory core and

25:55.459 --> 26:01.107
admitting women, my feelings were exactly the 
same. I knew it had to come. It was obvious that it

26:03.206 --> 26:04.487
was coming. But I still hated to give up the old way 
of doing things. But I think that's human nature.

26:09.192 --> 26:10.794
You just inertia. You just hate to, you know, when 
you're going down a certain path and you're

26:10.814 --> 26:19.603
comfortable with it, no matter how strong the 
evidence may be that you need to change, you hate to

26:10.814 --> 26:19.603
change. And so I had, I can't say I had any problems 
with it. It's just that there was a certain

26:27.511 --> 26:30.874
nostalgia involved in seeing the, the thing 
changed. But it changed so gradually that it

26:32.454 --> 26:35.757
really wasn't bad. Now, it appeared to be gradual 
to me because I was here on the scene. And I see a few

26:40.522 --> 26:44.886
women this semester and a few more next semester 
and a few more next semester. But to someone that

26:45.386 --> 26:51.852
was out in the boondocks that maybe thought or had 
contact with A&M say over two years, to him it was

26:45.386 --> 26:51.852
almost an instant change. So it probably didn't 
impact me as much as it did some of the guys out in the

26:52.693 --> 27:00.000
business world that didn't have that much direct 
contact with the university. But no question, it

27:01.128 --> 27:03.371
was the appropriate thing to do. It was not done 
lightly and at the whims of some one individual. It

27:07.517 --> 27:10.361
was done after much study. And it

27:10.381 --> 27:15.167
had to come. Do you remember, did General Rutter 
ever tell you about heat that he was getting from

27:16.008 --> 27:23.258
former students on this? Never told me directly, 
but I understand from conversation around the

27:23.278 --> 27:30.949
campus that he did take a tremendous amount of 
heat.

27:32.448 --> 27:38.154
That's, once again, where the mental 
conditioning and toughening that I talked about

27:32.448 --> 27:38.154
earlier. He had been in situations all of his life 
in which he had to take criticism. So he was

27:47.583 --> 27:50.686
equipped to handle criticism. Now, nobody ever 
likes to be criticized, but you can handle it. And

27:55.350 --> 27:58.533
if you've not been conditioned to handle it, then 
you just cave in. You can't handle it. So he was

28:00.967 --> 28:05.171
equipped to handle it. Some people say that only a 
man of his stature could have brought these

28:05.191 --> 28:11.218
changes abroad. What would you say about that? I 
think probably these conditions would have come

28:15.142 --> 28:22.009
about if we hadn't even had a president. It was just 
inevitable that these things happened. I think

28:25.192 --> 28:27.835
his presence and his personal popularity made the 
transition much easier, especially with some of

28:28.642 --> 28:32.627
our old die-hard former students. They had such 
great respect for him that they would more or less

28:33.448 --> 28:46.244
think, well, I don't like it, but if Earl's there 
and he says let's do it, I'll go because of Earl, not

28:33.448 --> 28:46.244
because I agree with him. But it might not have 
happened quite as soon. It might not have happened

28:48.767 --> 28:51.070
quite as smoothly. But all three of these things, I 
think, were inevitable, whether Rudder had been

28:51.730 --> 28:57.197
here or not. But I do think that his presence and his 
support of them made the medicine go down a little

28:57.683 --> 29:04.892
bit more easily. Now I'd like to ask about blacks 
and allowing blacks into A&M. What was your

29:12.181 --> 29:13.843
opinion on that? I don't think that there's my 
personal opinion is that it really hadn't had an

29:15.205 --> 29:21.793
adverse impact in any way whatsoever. I think that 
the biggest problem we have is that we've not been

29:22.153 --> 29:27.640
able to attract enough of them. Obviously, with 
the affirmative action thrust that the

29:27.873 --> 29:39.347
university has and has had since day one, not only 
with blacks but with Hispanics and other minority

29:27.873 --> 29:39.347
groups that we're trying to attract. Obviously, 
we want to attract the best students possible

29:40.668 --> 29:47.056
regardless of color, race, what have you. Other 
universities are in competition with the bright

29:48.778 --> 29:56.007
young students, whatever race. And we've just not 
been successful in attracting the numbers of

29:56.746 --> 30:00.812
blacks that I feel that we should have. But as far as 
their impact on core life, on campus life, I think

30:00.852 --> 30:07.462
it's been nothing but positive. I think when you 
come to the university,

30:07.482 --> 30:13.691
you look for a broadening experience. You look for 
finding ways to broaden your own horizon. And the

30:19.299 --> 30:22.804
way you do that is by rubbing up against the world. 
And we're a little... microcosm, so to speak, of

30:25.113 --> 30:27.476
the world here. We've got people from, well, not 
every country in the world, obviously, but from a

30:27.536 --> 30:32.681
lot of different countries. And by meeting and 
being thrown with these people, they learn from

30:33.242 --> 30:38.788
you, you learn from them. And you learn that 
possibly your narrow viewpoint of life is not the

30:39.329 --> 30:46.336
only one there is, and may not even be the best one 
there is. So I feel that there's been a positive

30:48.659 --> 30:52.403
influence And I'm all for it, and we need to do 
everything we can to continue in that direction.

30:57.513 --> 31:03.883
Why do you think we have not been able to attract as 
many minority students as you would like to see? I

31:04.284 --> 31:18.087
think it goes back to some of the traditional

31:04.284 --> 31:18.087
discriminatory policies that have existed 
primarily in the South over the past 20, 30 years,

31:04.284 --> 31:18.087
which the school segregation And the quality of 
high school graduates is reflected in SAT scores

31:18.893 --> 31:25.239
and things of that type. The students coming up 
through an all-black school system just weren't

31:27.381 --> 31:33.828
equipped to be competitive. And it's a 
competitive world we live in. You can pass all the

31:36.190 --> 31:41.856
laws you want to, but it comes right down to 
competition. And I feel that now that integration

31:41.876 --> 31:47.922
is a fact of life in our elementary and secondary 
school system that you're going to see more and

31:48.745 --> 31:58.274
more people, more and more blacks that will be in a 
position to be competitive than they have been in

31:48.745 --> 31:58.274
the past. I think the reason A&M has not done better 
is that and I don't think the black students want us

31:58.294 --> 32:05.741
to do this. We've not chosen to lower our standards 
just to attract a large number of black students.

32:10.125 --> 32:18.212
We've maintained our standards and the numbers of 
black students that can meet our standards are and

32:19.188 --> 32:28.377
are small in number, and they're highly sought 
after, not only from schools within the state, but

32:19.188 --> 32:28.377
from schools outside the state. So the 
competition for high school graduates with high

32:28.777 --> 32:38.346
SAT scores that are black is unbelievable. And we 
don't want just bodies. We want quality students,

32:42.430 --> 32:46.073
whatever the color may be. And the present policy 
is that we don't want to lower our standards in

32:46.643 --> 32:55.473
order to attract X numbers of minority students. 
We feel that now that the high school graduates,

32:55.493 --> 33:13.512
black students, seem to be more competitive, that 
in a matter of relatively short period of time,

32:55.493 --> 33:13.512
that the balance, the percentage of students 
today now will be pretty well in proportion to the

32:55.493 --> 33:13.512
percentage of blacks that graduate from Texas 
high schools, for example. So in other words, we

33:17.617 --> 33:20.222
feel like we're getting our fair share. But it's 
just that we need to, even though we might have a

33:20.903 --> 33:27.035
right percentage of the pie, the pie needs to be 
bigger. And that's the answer, really, is to

33:28.317 --> 33:33.407
graduate more black and Hispanic students that 
are competitive that we can accept. So does this go

33:36.811 --> 33:40.255
back to improving high schools in Texas? Oh, yes. 
And increasing integration? You bet. That's just

33:45.201 --> 33:47.064
basic. And I think we've done a fairly good job of 
that. It's just that you can't go from dead still to

33:49.567 --> 33:53.092
wide open instantly. It takes time. Oh, sure. And 
people are impatient with the passing of time. But

33:57.677 --> 33:59.380
it passes whether you're impatient or not. So 
we'll get there. And I would imagine that this is

34:00.910 --> 34:07.397
the same reason that we have a difficult time 
attracting minority faculty members. Same deal

34:08.638 --> 34:09.559
exactly. Competition. We were talking about some 
specific disciplines that we needed. I've

34:18.949 --> 34:22.432
forgotten what it was, but it was a scientific, I 
believe it was in the College of Medicine. They

34:22.452 --> 34:27.778
were interested in getting a black faculty member 
in a certain discipline. And it was determined at

34:29.429 --> 34:37.459
that time there was only one black guy in the entire 
state of Texas that practiced that particular

34:29.429 --> 34:37.459
discipline. And he was working somewhere else. So 
you've got to have a universe to draw from before

34:40.682 --> 34:45.168
you've got a fighting chance. And the universe 
just hasn't been there up until relatively recent

34:45.268 --> 34:50.534
years. And that's a failure of our education 
system, a past failure, which we're attempting to

34:50.554 --> 34:55.881
remedy. And I think we are remedying that. But a 
black student that entered the first grade with

35:01.525 --> 35:14.119
white students that's integrated all the way, 
then you should have every reason to assume that

35:01.525 --> 35:14.119
when they graduate from high school that the black 
students is going to be just as competitive as the

35:01.525 --> 35:14.119
white students. Now, that's not so now because it 
hadn't been that way from the first grade. The

35:17.923 --> 35:22.528
pipeline's got to run a while before you get good 
clear water coming out the end. And so it's

35:24.650 --> 35:27.493
running, and we'll get there. But in the meantime, 
we just got to do the best we can Be competitive. And

35:32.500 --> 35:45.612
I think our summer school program is a wonderful 
program in that we will let anyone in to our summer

35:32.500 --> 35:45.612
school program regardless of class standing and 
regardless of SAT scores. Yeah, that is a nice one.

35:46.553 --> 35:55.061
And then if they hack it, some people just by sheer 
guts can take a losing situation and turn it into a

35:46.553 --> 35:55.061
winning situation because they want to bad 
enough. And that program has been wonderful. Give

35:58.244 --> 35:59.545
everybody a chance. We don't plan on changing 
that, do we? Not to my knowledge. Of course, you're

36:03.941 --> 36:06.745
talking in the academic area now, which is not my 
area. So all I can give you is just man on the street

36:06.825 --> 36:11.952
hearsay type answers to academic type questions. 
Yeah, I think that's an outstanding program. Very

36:15.436 --> 36:16.758
necessary program. Now, we've talked about 
changes at A&M. We've talked about your military

36:19.141 --> 36:22.866
career and your ideas of leadership and your 
background. Is there something in this oral

36:23.133 --> 36:29.401
biography that you think that I've left out that 
you think that we should talk about? Basically,

36:29.421 --> 36:31.123
I'm out of questions. Okay. Is there some aspect 
that I didn't cover? Because you're the expert on

36:35.589 --> 36:37.031
your life. I might just ramble a few minutes, if I 
may. Fine. And tell you some of the things that are

36:40.896 --> 36:42.899
important in my life. Okay, good. To me, I try to, as 
best I can, and I realize that it's not possible to

36:44.821 --> 36:51.329
do this, but I try to compartmentalize my life. 
Mm-hmm. in the time compartments. When I go home,

36:54.760 --> 37:06.214
and I usually go home pretty close to 5 o'clock, 
5.15, 5.30 or so, unless there's something

36:54.760 --> 37:06.214
pushing me, I try to forget what's at work, and then 
I concentrate on things that I do at home. I'm a big

37:06.414 --> 37:08.757
time scheduler. I've got a time to do this and a time 
to do that. And I stick to it usually pretty well.

37:13.342 --> 37:19.009
Now, that's not to say it shouldn't be so 
inflexible that you can't change it to do things

37:13.342 --> 37:19.009
that need to be done. But I feel that a real, strong, 
happy family life at home is essential to a mental

37:19.900 --> 37:35.262
attitude which keeps you healthy and ready to go 
and do the jobs that need to be done during working

37:19.900 --> 37:35.262
hours.

37:37.926 --> 37:40.209
So I feel that a strong home life's important. I 
feel that some attention Not overboard now. I want

37:46.019 --> 37:50.424
to emphasize not overboard, but some attention to 
a religious side of life is important.

37:53.707 --> 37:55.409
Which we talked about a lot earlier. Yes. 
Regardless of what your religious beliefs may be,

37:55.970 --> 38:07.922
you need to have something other

37:55.970 --> 38:07.922
than just material and worldly things that you can 
dwell on. Now, religion, to some people, may take

38:08.723 --> 38:13.448
the forms of doing good works or being active in the 
United Fund, other people that may be worshiping a

38:13.664 --> 38:20.131
supreme being as they envision the supreme being. 
But whatever form your spiritual, that might be a

38:20.672 --> 38:29.282
better word, spiritual rather than religious, 
scrub religious and concentrate on spiritual.

38:29.823 --> 38:35.249
You need some religious outlet to realize that 
there is a spiritual side of man. Now, whatever

38:35.569 --> 38:38.913
thrust that takes is up to the individual. But 
there is a spiritual something there closely akin

38:39.674 --> 38:43.198
to emotion. And feelings. How do you show someone 
feelings? You can't show someone... It's

38:50.725 --> 38:55.692
something that... It's not monetary. It's not 
monetary. It's not physical. It has no mass. But

39:01.061 --> 39:02.062
it's very real. There's no one that would argue 
that there's not such a thing as emotion. Because

39:07.050 --> 39:07.971
we all have them. But I think you need to spend some 
time but not go overboard on the spiritual aspect

39:09.048 --> 39:17.919
of life.

39:18.079 --> 39:24.626
I believe, although I don't practice it, that a 
strong program of physical fitness is important.

39:24.647 --> 39:29.953
And every day that I get up, I say, boy, today's 
going to be the day when I really get with my

39:24.647 --> 39:29.953
physical fitness program. And on those rare days 
when I do go to the pool or whatever, I feel so much

39:33.483 --> 39:39.111
better, and I think, well, I ought to do this every 
day as good as I feel, but I don't do it. So I think

39:39.992 --> 39:42.896
that's important. I think spending a lot of time 
just talking with your spouse is important. My

39:49.345 --> 39:50.607
wife is a working wife. She's, I don't know if you 
want to get into family members and so forth, but we

39:52.790 --> 39:59.980
married at a, very early age my wife tells our 
friends that she was nine when we married but she

40:00.415 --> 40:24.837
was really 17 which by the day standards quite 
young back when i married that that was more of the

40:00.415 --> 40:24.837
pattern that you got married younger now it seems 
to be that you're married marrying in later years

40:00.415 --> 40:24.837
but and i was 20. married between my junior and 
senior year now after i graduated went into the

40:00.415 --> 40:24.837
active duty in the air force you know as we talked 
about earlier but any event To help keep the family

40:26.470 --> 40:31.558
finances afloat, she worked as a secretary 
primarily for years. And then when I came back here

40:32.239 --> 40:41.654
to A&M and settled down, well, she went to work as a 
secretary at what was then Bank of A&M, secretary

40:32.239 --> 40:41.654
to the president, Dennis Gearing. Dennis is still 
in this part of the country, by the way, doing

40:43.818 --> 40:48.084
industrial development work. But anyway, that 
was almost 18 years ago. through hard work and

40:52.981 --> 40:55.865
being in the right place at the right time. She has 
been promoted up the line until she's now

40:55.945 --> 41:05.859
secretary to the board of directors and is vice 
president for marketing and business

40:55.945 --> 41:05.859
development. So the number of people working for 
her in a very, very responsible job, an

41:06.700 --> 41:12.468
interesting job. She's a very pretty lady and very 
proud of her, both for her accomplishments and for

41:13.209 --> 41:20.359
being the kind of person that she is. We've been 
married a little over 30 years now. So we had an

41:22.613 --> 41:26.157
extremely fine marriage, just absolutely 
perfect. But when we come here from work, I usually

41:27.138 --> 41:31.763
get off a little earlier than she does. So I go to the 
grocery store, pick up what groceries we need to

41:31.803 --> 41:37.909
get, and I go to the cleaners and do a lot of the 
errands. So when she gets off work, she goes

41:37.929 --> 41:39.651
straight home. We'll sit down and spend 15, 20 
minutes, sometimes 30, doing nothing but just

41:39.711 --> 41:50.963
talking about how did they go and talking about the 
kids and making plans and just a time together. I

41:50.983 --> 41:52.384
think that's very important. You need to spend 
time talking to the kids. I don't even know if I've

41:55.974 --> 42:06.086
got the title right, but there was a ballad that 
came out several years back, and I believe it was

41:55.974 --> 42:06.086
called A Cat in the Cradle. Are you familiar with 
the words to that ballad? To me, those are so

42:10.612 --> 42:12.174
meaningful. It's a story about this father that 
never could find time for his son. The son wanted to

42:15.618 --> 42:20.905
play ball, and the dad says, maybe later I've got to 
do this or that. And then later on... The song goes

42:23.330 --> 42:25.513
on. The man gets old. And his son grows up and goes to 
college. And the son comes in and says, the dad

42:28.277 --> 42:32.883
says, well, son, can we sit down and visit a few 
minutes? He said, maybe later, dad. I just want to

42:33.984 --> 42:35.346
borrow the keys to the car. In other words, the worm 
has turned. Then the son has no time for the father.

42:40.353 --> 42:52.830
And I think it's really important when you have 
children to spend some time with them and teach

42:40.353 --> 42:52.830
them some of your values so that at least they may 
not accept them, but at least they know what you

42:40.353 --> 42:52.830
feel is important in life. So to me, to have a rich, 
well-rounded life, that's very important that

42:53.840 --> 43:06.197
you spend quality time with the family.

43:06.217 --> 43:12.205
I feel

43:06.217 --> 43:12.205
that you should have something to look forward to 
at all times. You should have a plan of things that

43:12.225 --> 43:16.530
you want to do at certain phases of your life. For 
example, now that I've been with A&M a number of

43:16.551 --> 43:19.915
years, and I'll be 52 years old on my next birthday, 
I'm making some real definite plans for my

43:20.502 --> 43:27.691
retirement years. I plan on retiring from A&M. 
Well, the ideal time for me would be on my 60th

43:30.956 --> 43:34.480
birthday. I would draw the full retirement, which 
would be an adequate retirement to live on. My Air

43:38.906 --> 43:41.089
Force retirement pay would start at that time. But 
I still feel that 60, assuming you're in good

43:41.850 --> 43:47.377
health, is way too early to go sit in a rocking 
chair. Yeah. I don't know just what I'm going to do

43:49.139 --> 43:56.852
yet, but I'm spending a lot of time on thinking I 
have an intense interest in the stock market. I may

43:56.992 --> 44:03.282
want to try to become an account executive or 
something like that. Supposedly, in today's

44:04.524 --> 44:10.033
environment, 60 is not too old to start into a 
program like that. You mentioned my interest in

44:10.514 --> 44:14.320
books on the stock market. This gives you a chance 
to do things you've always wanted to do but just

44:14.738 --> 44:19.684
never really were able to do. So I think planning 
ahead and having something to dream about is very

44:19.704 --> 44:24.370
important. What do you see as your future here at 
A&M now that you're a vice president? I'm in an

44:29.557 --> 44:37.607
enviable position that most people never reach, 
and that is that I'm in the job that I want to keep for

44:29.557 --> 44:37.607
the rest of my working life. This, in my opinion, 
that's true. And it's a very calming, relaxing

44:41.439 --> 44:43.743
position. And that doesn't mean that I don't have 
day-to-day problems. But I don't have to worry

44:46.607 --> 44:54.099
about being in competition with Tom Jones or Joe 
Blow for the next promotion, because there is no

44:46.607 --> 44:54.099
more promotion for me. This is the top of my field. 
This is as high as it's possible for me to go in my

44:56.402 --> 45:01.069
chosen area. And of course, I work for the 
president. Well, obviously, the president's

45:03.092 --> 45:07.459
always going to be a PhD type with a lot of academic 
credentials and teaching. And that's not of

45:07.810 --> 45:09.132
interest to me. So I have reached the highest goal 
that it's possible for me to reach at Texas A&M. In

45:16.801 --> 45:23.069
the Air Force Reserve, there's only one more rank 
that it's possible for me to achieve, and I'd like

45:16.801 --> 45:23.069
to do that. Your second star. My second star, 
because that's the highest rank a reserve officer

45:23.449 --> 45:27.414
can hold in the Air Force Reserve. I'm not going to 
be at all disappointed if I don't make it, but I'd be

45:28.956 --> 45:32.821
very happy if I did make it. What do you think your 
chances are, and would you explain how your job

45:33.061 --> 45:37.547
would change them? for that second star? I'll be 
real honest with you and tell you that my chances

45:40.025 --> 45:44.989
for a second star are very slim. Sure. For 
basically one reason, and that is that I'm not a

45:47.031 --> 45:50.214
rated officer. By that I mean I don't fly. I'm not a 
pilot or a navigator. Many, many, many of your

45:55.399 --> 45:59.863
reserve jobs require that as a prerequisite. In 
other words, the mobilization assistant to all of

45:59.903 --> 46:06.049
your flying major air commands, for example, SAC, 
TAC.
