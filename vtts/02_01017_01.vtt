00:06.427 --> 00:15.721
This is an interview with Eloy Rodriguez by Jaime 
Rodriguez on November 20, 1990, at Thomas

00:06.427 --> 00:15.721
Jefferson Junior High School, Beagle, Texas, 
concerning the Vietnam War. In the interest of

00:16.842 --> 00:24.354
accumulating knowledge, I'm asking you to donate 
this tape to me or to the Texas A&M oral history

00:16.842 --> 00:24.354
collection in the university archives. Is that 
all right with you? Yes, it's all right. Please

00:28.460 --> 00:29.301
state your name. It's Eloy Rodriguez. And your 
date of birth? October the 3rd, 1945. Okay, where

00:35.924 --> 00:37.485
did you grow up? I grew up in Beaver, Texas. What 
made you decide to join the Marines? Well, at that

00:43.471 --> 00:54.121
time, Jaime, the draft was in effect, and if you 
weren't in school and you were of age, you were

00:43.471 --> 00:54.121
being drafted. At the time, I was working in Los 
Angeles, California, and I got my draft notice in

00:54.141 --> 01:03.130
Texas, so I saw that as a way to get back home. as an 
excuse to get back home. So I came back and I was

01:06.020 --> 01:10.428
going to get drafted. So what I did, I went ahead and 
enlisted in the Marine Corps under the lay

01:10.449 --> 01:14.757
program. So I enlisted in January, but I didn't go 
in until late for the 14th. How long were you in the

01:21.811 --> 01:24.797
Marines before you went to Vietnam? My first day of 
boot camp was April the 14th, 1966. And going back

01:31.404 --> 01:37.314
to your previous question, I joined the Marine 
Corps because everyone was joining the Marine

01:31.404 --> 01:37.314
Corps, all my friends. And if you didn't join the 
Marine Corps, you weren't really too popular with

01:38.135 --> 01:43.123
the other guys. That's the reason I jumped. But I 
was in the Marine Corps. Boot camp was April the

01:47.501 --> 01:49.264
14th, 1966. I took my basic training in San Diego. 
Then I went to Camp Pelton, California. After

01:57.757 --> 02:00.902
that, I went to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. We 
did a tour in Puerto Rico for a couple of months.

02:05.269 --> 02:10.056
Then I came back, and I had my orders from Vietnam in 
August of 1967. When you first went to the war, did

02:11.234 --> 02:14.980
you feel that the war was winnable? Well, to be 
honest with you, Jaime, I didn't know that much

02:16.362 --> 02:20.548
about what was going on. All I knew was that we had a 
lot of men over there. I knew we had a war. I knew that

02:25.316 --> 02:33.428
if you went in the Marine Corps and you didn't go to 
Vietnam, that you weren't really a Marine until

02:25.316 --> 02:33.428
you went over there. As far as whether the war was 
winnable or not, I assumed that it was. What they

02:39.984 --> 02:47.858
were telling us was that it would be a matter of 
months before we came back, that we would win this

02:39.984 --> 02:47.858
thing at any time. So I went over there on a 13-month 
tour, but expecting to come back any time before.

02:54.950 --> 02:58.116
You said you were stationed at different 
locations. around the United States, but when you

02:58.552 --> 03:01.955
went to Vietnam, where were you stationed? I was at 
Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. I got there about

03:04.718 --> 03:16.069
the middle of January of 67, and I was there until 
August of 67 with a little tour to Puerto Rico. What

03:16.549 --> 03:19.853
were your job descriptions in the Marines? When I 
graduated from boot camp, my MOS, which is what you

03:19.873 --> 03:27.580
do in the military, 2533, that's a radio telegraph 
operator. I went to school for approximately four

03:30.739 --> 03:33.842
months in San Diego. But once I left school, I 
didn't see the telegraph team anymore. I went to

03:38.288 --> 03:44.095
June, Camp of June, and I became a radio operator, 
which is 2531. When I got to Vietnam, I was a radio

03:45.577 --> 03:51.364
operator for an infantry company, 2531. But I also 
became a wireman, which I think was a 2511. I became

03:57.175 --> 04:01.142
a murder man, which was in 03-41, I believe. I also 
served as a rifleman, which was in 03-11. So I had

04:04.908 --> 04:06.852
various MOSs. I picked them up, OJT, they called 
them, on the job training. During the time of

04:12.902 --> 04:17.310
combat, what was the morale like of the soldiers? 
Well, it's difficult to say. When you're over here

04:22.709 --> 04:31.097
in the States, boy, you just can't wait to go over 
there to serve your country and do what the other

04:22.709 --> 04:31.097
Marines are doing. Again, you can call yourself a 
true Marine unless you went over there. But as time

04:35.101 --> 04:41.007
got closer to go to Vietnam, you start getting a 
little shaky and not knowing what to expect. For

04:43.189 --> 04:46.933
whatever reasons, I felt that I was going to be a 
telegraph operator. And I got over there. They

04:48.678 --> 04:53.904
were up front with me as a radio operator. So my 
morale when I got over there, I was scared. But as I

04:58.869 --> 05:01.992
went to my base camp, I saw that other guys were 
there. And I was scared because of the unknown. I

05:07.518 --> 05:08.740
didn't know what to expect. The morale was good in 
the rear when I first got there. But once you go out

05:13.965 --> 05:18.330
on patrols and things of this nature, You, even as a 
young man, you start thinking of other things. The

05:24.464 --> 05:32.753
people back home, girlfriend, parents, what are 
people doing back in America? You are 19, 20 years

05:32.793 --> 05:34.315
old. You don't know if you're going to come back. 
You're a lot more careful now. You're much more

05:38.500 --> 05:46.849
mature beyond your years as far as thinking ahead 
again about your families. You are a lot more

05:47.639 --> 05:49.341
careful. You listen to the guys who have been there 
before. You do what they ask you to do, because

05:53.625 --> 05:58.190
they're the ones who know. They're the ones who 
have been there. So again, I was there in the early

06:00.392 --> 06:03.015
part of it. I was there in 67, 68, which was a lot 
different from 70, 71, 72. So the morale, I feel,

06:08.941 --> 06:11.003
was high. We believed what they told us. We felt 
that we had a purpose to be over there. We felt that

06:16.715 --> 06:18.518
we were doing the right thing. What were your 
personal feelings toward Arvin? Well, again,

06:25.068 --> 06:31.358
Jaime, when I got there, the word was that don't 
trust the Arvins. They don't want to fight.

06:34.463 --> 06:40.092
They'll go out with you, and if the action gets too 
heavy, they're going to retreat on their own.

06:40.132 --> 06:41.954
They're not good at following instructions. 
Personally, I didn't like them. because of what I

06:44.542 --> 06:47.226
had heard and the little I saw. I couldn't trust 
them. The other people that were around me

06:50.712 --> 06:54.598
wouldn't trust them. They had a way about them that 
was very untrustworthy. It seemed like they were

06:59.166 --> 07:06.378
out to get whatever they could get from you, 
whether it was food or money or weapons or

06:59.166 --> 07:06.378
whatever. I didn't like them. I didn't trust them. 
I didn't know what they were up to. How was the

07:12.588 --> 07:23.985
racism situation as far as the U.S. military and 
the Vietnamese people, or any kind of racism?

07:24.806 --> 07:26.930
Well, we felt that they weren't our equal. We felt 
that we were there to help them, and they should be

07:27.130 --> 07:32.278
grateful for that. We treated them as 
second-class citizens. To us, they weren't up to

07:37.445 --> 07:40.570
par with us. And I think they felt, some of them felt 
the same way about us. I still remember going

07:46.771 --> 07:54.921
through a village, and there was maybe about 100 
little kids, six, seven, eight-year-olds. And

07:54.941 --> 08:01.149
someone took a camera and took their pictures, and 
every single one of those kids shot us the finger.

08:01.169 --> 08:06.896
So at that time, this was like in October of 67, 
things went through my mind. I said, well, we're

08:06.936 --> 08:08.818
here to help them. But now I see this. I don't know 
what's going on. Once you got back into the States,

08:14.265 --> 08:18.470
was it hard to get back into the American swing of 
things? Well, in a way, yes, and in a way, no, Jaime.

08:25.499 --> 08:34.711
I remember when we went over there, we went through 
all kinds of counseling sessions, being nice to

08:25.499 --> 08:34.711
their people, with their guests, do this, do that. 
We'd come back, and no one tells us how the, how the

08:38.785 --> 08:42.691
world is going to react to us, especially the 
United States. They don't tell us what's been

08:43.392 --> 08:47.078
going on here for the last year. And when you're 
over there, especially when you're in the rear,

08:48.480 --> 08:54.770
you talk about home. You talk about when you come 
back, oh, I'm going to school, I'm getting

08:54.790 --> 09:00.799
married, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. 
And when you come back, you do all those things.

09:05.186 --> 09:07.189
Sometimes you try and get everything in as quickly 
as possible. You want to get married. You want to

09:09.918 --> 09:10.939
get a job. You want to get back to school.

09:14.964 --> 09:18.549
And there's changes. Really, when I came back, I 
just wanted to do all those things we talked about.

09:24.797 --> 09:28.862
And now I feel that maybe I was too quick in doing 
some of those things. What were some of the

09:31.085 --> 09:34.830
strategies that the United States used to try to 
win this war? Well, the bombing, bombing of the

09:36.515 --> 10:03.214
North, the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the

09:36.515 --> 10:03.214
what's it called, the Agent Orange,

09:36.515 --> 10:03.214
what they call the Vietnamization of the 
countryside, where we were sent out people to work

09:36.515 --> 10:03.214
with the farmers, with the small villages, and 
trying to win them over. Those are the ones I

10:04.983 --> 10:08.388
remember at this time. I'm sure there was a lot of 
others. But I don't think it helped. If anything,

10:14.697 --> 10:16.680
it was the bombing of the North. That might have 
been effective. But as far as Vietnamizing the

10:19.104 --> 10:23.290
countryside and the villages, no. They would go to 
the person who was there last. If we were there,

10:27.957 --> 10:29.519
they were on our side. And the Arvins, which is the 
Army of the Republic of Vietnam. I'm sorry, the

10:35.635 --> 10:37.858
NVA, the North Vietnamese Army. When they were 
there, well, they had control. So I don't feel any

10:40.682 --> 10:42.684
in-country. By that, I mean South Vietnam. 
Anything we did in South Vietnam, it didn't seem to

10:44.306 --> 10:47.090
work. OK. As far as the search and destroy strategy 
went, did you feel that was an effective strategy

10:47.190 --> 10:56.062
in episode one? Well, not really, because we 
searched and we destroyed. It wasn't really

11:01.987 --> 11:05.511
because what it did, it made a lot of enemies. 
You're talking about people who have been there

11:06.332 --> 11:12.338
for generations and generations, parents, 
grandparents, great-grandparents. They all

11:13.139 --> 11:19.346
came from that village, and here comes these big 
American soldiers, and they're burning it down,

11:13.139 --> 11:19.346
they're relocating you. You're having to start 
all over. I don't think it was effective in that

11:21.468 --> 11:26.453
sense. Whatever we destroyed, it was replaced by 
the... by the Viet Cong or the NBA. So I feel that it

11:34.923 --> 11:38.929
wasn't effective.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.871
Did you personally agree with this war? Again, I 
was there in the early part of the war. This thing

11:45.497 --> 11:47.460
started, I think, in March of 65. And when I got 
there in September of 67, it was still popular.

11:54.770 --> 11:57.373
Most of the United States felt we were doing the 
right thing. So I felt good about going over there,

11:58.248 --> 12:03.394
again, because of what they told us, what you 
heard. And that's the reason we said those things,

12:04.295 --> 12:07.158
because that's all they told us. Again, the early 
part of the war, we felt that we were doing good. And

12:13.065 --> 12:28.002
as things turned out, because of the lack of 
support and what I've heard say, because of a few

12:13.065 --> 12:28.002
vocal minority, we were forced to do a lot of 
things. Instead of going all out and trying to win

12:29.146 --> 12:32.029
this war. Because even if we did, we might have not 
won it. OK. Once the war started getting towards

12:36.313 --> 12:47.805
the end and the American people started feeling 
that it was not going to be a winnable war, there was

12:36.313 --> 12:47.805
a bunch of anti-war protests. What were your 
feelings on that? Well, at that time and until very

12:50.368 --> 12:53.471
recently, I really hated it. And I guess, in a 
sense, I still do. Here you were. putting your life

12:59.183 --> 13:00.545
on the line. That was the fact that many young 
Americans died because they were defending the

13:00.625 --> 13:11.958
same rights that I feel these people were abusing 
by protesting the war. Again, that was another

13:13.059 --> 13:25.393
thing that happened that forced our people in 
Washington to turn their back on us in a way where

13:13.059 --> 13:25.393
they were beginning to listen to the voters or to 
the people who were protesting. And the war, it

13:28.874 --> 13:37.459
wasn't a standstill, but there was so much 
conflict with people for and against the war, that

13:37.726 --> 13:49.979
this thing, it seemed like the North Vietnamese 
purposely let it run more because they could see

13:37.726 --> 13:49.979
what was happening in the United States. It was a 
split United States. And the ones that were really

13:52.862 --> 13:57.207
being hurt were the people who were over there. 
Well, again, by the end of the war, the United

13:59.089 --> 14:07.378
States people started thinking it wasn't worth 
it. and all this news was getting back to the

14:08.371 --> 14:13.055
soldiers, did the morale change at all? Well, it 
did change. Again, I was there earlier, and it had

14:14.717 --> 14:22.364
to have changed, because those guys were here when 
all this was going on. They didn't get over there

14:22.384 --> 14:24.906
until 70, 71, 72. So they saw all of this before they 
left. They knew that a lot of America was against

14:28.229 --> 14:31.432
this war. And again, it was two different wars, 65 
to probably the end of 68, early 69. You had the

14:38.729 --> 14:42.673
people who wanted to be over there, about 80. And 
this is, I'm just guesstimating, about 80% of the

14:42.693 --> 14:51.461
people from 65 to early, early 69 wanted to be 
there. But after that, you started getting all the

14:51.862 --> 15:00.070
draftees from the middle of 69 on till the war was 
over. A lot of those guys over there were draftees

15:00.090 --> 15:04.674
who didn't want to be over there. So the attitude 
was different. They knew that. that people in

15:07.957 --> 15:11.762
America weren't supporting, so they didn't want 
to get killed or whatever. It seemed like a lost

15:11.782 --> 15:13.544
cause to them. Hey, did the combat refusals become 
a problem? Not when I was there, especially in the

15:18.290 --> 15:21.975
Marine Corps. I don't know how the Army reacted, 
but the Marine Corps, I feel, is a very elite group.

15:30.285 --> 15:32.648
Whether you're a... you can't... Say, I'm not 
going. There's just too many people against you.

15:37.845 --> 15:44.312
So that never, to us, again in 67, 68, that never 
crossed our minds. There was times we didn't want

15:44.532 --> 15:46.314
to go. There's no way we were going to say no, 
because we were going to go anyway. No one was going

15:50.158 --> 15:52.320
to let us stay behind. So we were going to go one way 
or the other. So we never said no. I know towards the

15:57.105 --> 16:00.188
latter part of the war, there was a lot of that. 
Maybe it was with reason. I don't know if I would

16:03.116 --> 16:07.321
have been in the Army in 1972, and I might have 
refused, yes. Could you describe a typical day

16:10.005 --> 16:12.448
during the war? Well, it all depended on what you 
were doing that day. If you were in the rear, it was a

16:19.737 --> 16:23.282
lot more work. There was more people watching you. 
Maybe you had... kitchen work to do, maybe you had

16:28.720 --> 16:35.368
radio watches during the day, you wrote letters. 
If you were getting ready to go out, well, then

16:37.371 --> 16:51.548
that's when you wrote your personal letters to 
your girlfriend, wives, parents, telling them

16:37.371 --> 16:51.548
you were going to go out and be back in maybe a week. 
So if they don't hear from you, that's why. I was on a

16:55.152 --> 16:58.356
hospital ship, the USS Princeton. And we usually 
would go back for a day or two, take a shower, eat a

16:59.450 --> 17:05.278
meal, and we knew we were going out. It was called a 
BLT, Battalion Landing Team. What we did, we

17:10.045 --> 17:12.789
cruised the coast of South Vietnam. We did this for 
a couple of months. And whenever someone got in

17:15.232 --> 17:20.019
trouble, the helicopters would take us out. And 
it's kind of an empty feeling. It's like you don't

17:24.766 --> 17:29.372
know where you're going or what's going to happen. 
It's kind of a quiet moment for everyone. You just

17:32.196 --> 17:39.246
sit there and get your thoughts together and go out 
and do your job.

17:40.487 --> 17:42.851
Once you got back, how did the people treat you? 
Well, the majority of them... Well, let me restate

17:44.713 --> 17:50.781
that. The majority of my friends welcomed me back. 
They were glad I was back. They were glad... that I

17:59.221 --> 18:01.967
came back in one piece. It's people that you didn't 
know. I enrolled at Bee County College, and there

18:04.532 --> 18:17.740
was a couple of instructors there who kind of 
didn't make you feel comfortable because they

18:04.532 --> 18:17.740
seemed like they were against the war. I remember 
in speech, I gave a presentation on the war. And the

18:23.087 --> 18:27.412
guy, I thought it was at least a C, of course. But it 
seemed like the guy just wasn't too gung ho about

18:28.273 --> 18:33.479
what was happening over there. So I received a D. So 
from people I didn't know, it just wasn't the same.

18:41.348 --> 18:49.697
It got to where anyone who you didn't know, you 
wouldn't talk to them about Vietnam. Okay, now I

18:50.521 --> 18:56.807
realize that this may be a touchy subject, but did 
you kill anyone during combat? And if so, how are

18:56.827 --> 18:59.109
you coping with it now? Well, we killed quite a few 
people. I was a caisson, a battle of caisson from

19:02.672 --> 19:08.177
the middle of January to late April. I'm sorry, 
late March, early April. And as a unit, we had, I

19:11.961 --> 19:19.988
think the estimates are, I think, over 15,000. my 
own company. I know we're responsible for quite a

19:23.640 --> 19:25.522
few. We try to overrun us one night. We put mortars 
on a lot of them. I don't know how many we killed. As

19:32.830 --> 19:38.115
far as it bothered me, I try never, never to think 
about things like that. It's just something that

19:38.255 --> 19:45.663
it's kind of a deep secret, something that you did 
that you don't want to tell anyone. I don't even

19:46.944 --> 19:47.865
like to to remember any details of it. Somehow, for 
some reason, I just refuse to remember the details

19:52.933 --> 20:01.282
about our killing. I do remember, in a lot of 
detail, our men

20:01.302 --> 20:08.609
that were killed. That's because someone you were 
with all the time. And yes, our unit killed a lot of

20:12.253 --> 20:17.599
North Vietnamese. OK. Well, that's all the 
questions I have. I'd like to thank you for taking

20:21.837 --> 20:26.354
time and participating in this interview. And 
that's it. Thank you very much, Hank.
