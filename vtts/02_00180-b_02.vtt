WEBVTT

00:01.077 --> 00:02.939
kind of a diner place. There was a county truck, 
gravel truck like, a big truck. And there were some

00:10.087 --> 00:20.378
guys standing around there arguing and some other 
guys came from inside arguing and they were

00:10.087 --> 00:20.378
shouting back and forth at each other as we pulled 
up. And Carroll turned to me and he said, I don't

00:20.459 --> 00:24.103
want you to say a word. You talk funny and I don't 
want these people to have any trouble with us. I

00:30.136 --> 00:34.020
thought that was pretty instructive. But the 
other funny word was,

00:34.040 --> 00:58.523
funny way they talk here was again in that first 
year, I had a close association with the town of

00:34.040 --> 00:58.523
Mahea,

00:34.040 --> 00:58.523
okay? One of their sons, are you ready for a long 
story here? One of their sons had gone off, he was a

01:03.879 --> 01:07.983
homosexual. He was a scion of a old family, long 
time family there. He'd gone off to New York City,

01:15.671 --> 01:27.042
got in dramatics, got fairly famous and well to do, 
came back fairly rich, decided to come back to the

01:15.671 --> 01:27.042
old hometown and retire. And then he decided he 
wanted to resurrect the old Poco Grounds. It was

01:37.309 --> 01:41.252
the Pure Oil Company, P-O-C-O. It was on the 
Confederate Reunion Grounds on Jack's Creek. And

01:49.640 --> 01:52.603
he got hold of me because he had read about this 
department. He wanted me to come up and help him

01:52.623 --> 01:57.147
design a tourist attraction on Jack's Creek by 
taking some of the pure oil storage tanks, huge

01:58.088 --> 02:16.474
things, and renovating them inside, air 
conditioning them, making a stage inside, and

01:58.088 --> 02:16.474
recreating the history of the plantation era 
inside the oil tank, okay? That was his dream. So I

02:18.617 --> 02:19.879
went up several times. In fact, he did develop 
enough support that they cleaned up some of the

02:19.919 --> 02:27.690
old, reunion grounds there on Jack's Creek and and 
they found some of the bathhouse steps that went

02:27.670 --> 02:54.420
down to the creek that the people in their parasols 
had come and Governor Conley came one night the

02:27.670 --> 02:54.420
night I'm speaking of after he'd been at another 
meeting they had him as head speaker to dedicate

02:27.670 --> 02:54.420
this thing during his governorship he got there 
late everybody else had finished the barbecue and

02:56.257 --> 03:22.686
he pulled in it was after dark the lanterns were on 
and he sat down and ate barbecue by himself at this

02:56.257 --> 03:22.686
whole head table with a hundred people watching 
him eat not saying a word just i'm going to eat

02:56.257 --> 03:22.686
before i talk and it was the strangest thing to me 
that a person would come in and have the Courage, I

03:23.797 --> 03:26.502
guess, or the sense to just stand there and eat. But 
the thing about Mejia was, my wife went up with me

03:27.424 --> 03:33.314
that night, and she was trying to read the map. I'd 
been there a couple times already with this guy,

03:33.955 --> 03:42.331
and so I knew where I was going, but Dot was looking 
at the map. And I said, we want to go to Mejia. We've

03:43.893 --> 03:47.560
got to go up through Calvert, her and Calvert, and 
on up. And she said, I can't find it. I can't find it.

03:51.430 --> 03:52.191
I can't find it. And that was the reason, because 
she was looking for Mexia, and it's M-E-X-I-A. In

03:57.817 --> 04:01.402
fact, I found when you're up there and talking to 
those people, it's Mehair. Mehair. Not Mehea. But

04:04.385 --> 04:11.033
yeah, that was one of the first times that I saw that 
there was a different language down here. I'm

04:12.717 --> 04:15.963
getting close to the end of the things I've thought 
of. Are there some people that you would like to

04:16.524 --> 04:21.172
thank that we haven't mentioned? Well, you know, I 
didn't give much credence to Wayne Hall, but

04:22.013 --> 04:36.278
certainly he was one that did support me in this 
whole organization thing at the start of this.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.030
Gosh, I'm sure there's just... I think Wayne Hall 
is one of the underappreciated people here that he

04:42.050 --> 04:47.000
did more... He was just a quiet gentleman. Quiet. 
And I've learned that Mr. Rutter on academic

04:49.365 --> 04:53.473
matters would listen to him. And among other 
things, I've learned that he's the one that

04:54.263 --> 05:01.031
thought up the name of this institution as it is now 
phrased. Really? Mr. Rutter, we recommended

05:02.052 --> 05:04.676
Texas State University. Mr. Rutter would not 
stand that at all. He didn't want to lose A&M. And so

05:09.842 --> 05:18.372
instead of the Agricultural Mechanical College 
of Texas or Texas State University, he came up with

05:09.842 --> 05:18.372
Texas A&M University. Without the letters. Which 
I think has worked pretty well. Yeah, excellent.

05:22.637 --> 05:23.899
Others you'd like to... appreciation

05:26.090 --> 05:39.002
josh haskell i'd just have to all right you may 
think of those later before we edit it uh some proud

05:26.090 --> 05:39.002
moments that we haven't mentioned proud personal 
moments

05:50.018 --> 05:51.941
Never had a proud moment in my life. Okay.

05:55.627 --> 05:57.009
Then two last things. Let's make believe that 
someone walks up to you in the next few days and

05:58.011 --> 06:08.968
hands you a check for a million dollars, but it's 
payable to Texas A&M University, but you've got to

05:58.011 --> 06:08.968
decide what is done with it. Oh, wow. What would you 
want? If you had the capacity to give A&M a big sum of

06:11.512 --> 06:17.882
money, what would you want that used for? A 
million's not big money anymore now when MIT gets

06:18.098 --> 06:24.508
350 million to study the brain.

06:29.497 --> 06:40.174
I'd really have to think about that, but I suspect 
it would in some way be

06:29.497 --> 06:40.174
leveraged to help students. because the 
financial thing has got out of hand so much lately

06:41.369 --> 06:49.497
that I don't see how people are paying it. And so 
much, it seems to me, that comes to the university

06:50.778 --> 07:04.352
comes for personal aggrandizement

06:50.778 --> 07:04.352
that's short term. Do you remember over in the MSC 
originally when Who was it, the Scotsman that went

07:09.365 --> 07:20.718
down to Mexico and had that beautiful circular rug 
woven with the A&M logo in the middle of it? I don't

07:21.839 --> 07:23.301
know where that rug is now. Think about that. I 
don't either. And how many buildings have been

07:27.606 --> 07:33.753
named and then the names changed when a bigger gift 
comes in. And so many of these things really don't

07:38.086 --> 07:41.431
benefit the students. How would you want the 
student, the winners, how would you want the

07:42.753 --> 07:48.081
recipients to be selected? I don't know what, I'm 
not sure that I would want it to be individual

07:48.562 --> 07:59.419
selection or instead some mechanism that would 
uh... benefit a larger number i'd really have to

08:00.935 --> 08:30.283
think about that i'm not certain that a university 
like this is well that's just way off the subject

08:00.935 --> 08:30.283
what i was going to say was whether there's any 
sense in trying to maintain universities in this

08:00.935 --> 08:30.283
form of a pile of bricks and mortar at a single 
location when we're entering into a time when With

08:31.225 --> 08:46.002
distance education and computers, we can maybe do 
a better job without babysitting people for four

08:31.225 --> 08:46.002
to six years to come and be at a specific location 
away from home. Maybe it serves some social

08:46.103 --> 08:52.150
purposes other than education, but I'm not sure 
this is the best way to do education. Boy, that's

08:54.332 --> 08:58.397
not a way to answer your question about how do you 
spend a million dollars. Last question, what

08:58.968 --> 09:06.483
feelings do you have for Texas A&M in your heart 
now, after a third of a century? That sounds so

09:07.846 --> 09:09.990
long. I'm

09:10.050 --> 09:19.609
just really thankful to God that I had the 
opportunity to come here.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.812
It's been a good life. I think the university 
treated me more fairly than I probably deserved.

09:31.540 --> 09:34.743
And it was a great location to rear a family. And 
they've become staunch Texans even though

09:36.164 --> 09:41.629
neither of them are living in the state right now.

09:45.553 --> 09:50.237
If your machine were off, I'd say I'd like to have a 
lot closer relation with the, department than I

09:51.348 --> 09:54.011
have currently. And maybe I will again, but I've 
backed way off in order not to make it appear

09:54.271 --> 10:05.342
confrontational. And if that means moving out of 
here for a while, I'm willing to do that. Dorothy's

10:13.810 --> 10:16.412
saying, keep that at all costs. I said, no, it's not 
that important. There's other things that are

10:18.634 --> 10:20.376
more important. But I've gained lifelong friends 
and colleagues that I treasure from being here

10:21.436 --> 10:31.186
that length of time. I don't think for people in the 
future they will, well you've even moved around

10:33.248 --> 10:39.995
more than I have. I mean I came here and I've been 
here ever since and you've gone on and done some

10:40.076 --> 10:46.262
great things at other places. before coming back 
here, but I think it's going to become more of a

10:46.782 --> 11:00.142
rarity for people to stay half a century or a third 
of a century in one job or one location. We've

11:00.182 --> 11:05.610
taught for years about serial occupations, 
careers.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.798
I think A&M has changed. tremendously in that 
length of time, but I think the school has stayed

11:11.943 --> 11:31.757
true to its traditions and its origins in a lot of 
ways that are going to serve it well in the future.
