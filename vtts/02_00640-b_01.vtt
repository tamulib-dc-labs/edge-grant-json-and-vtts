WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:02.696
from every five years. Well, that's right, but 
most of us don't have enough courage to do so.

00:04.939 --> 00:16.595
That's the truth of that matter.

00:17.557 --> 00:21.562
Why did you choose to leave ONR? Well, it came about 
in 1965.

00:27.731 --> 00:28.452
Paul Feig came down to see me in Washington and 
asked me if I was interested in coming up here and

00:29.478 --> 00:39.288
working at Woods Hole. And I met with he and Noel 
McLean, who was chairman of the board at that time.

00:47.235 --> 00:51.359
After meeting with him a little while, I told him 
no. I was happy and O and R. I didn't think I wanted to

00:51.379 --> 00:57.325
leave at that time. The

00:59.549 --> 01:14.263
reason I was doing something in ONR that I thought 
made a lot of sense, and I wanted to kind of follow

00:59.549 --> 01:14.263
through. And the problem that, again, Hugh 
McClellan, who was in ONR working for me at the

01:14.383 --> 01:24.212
time, and I went over to see Walter. Again, we're 
talking to Walter Monk on this. saying, gee, well,

01:30.042 --> 01:39.976
what are the experiments that's equivalent to 
what ARPA is doing on this large array they're

01:30.042 --> 01:39.976
putting in? We ought to be looking at experiments 
in oceanography that are really pushing the

01:40.136 --> 01:44.823
frontiers ahead. We

01:44.883 --> 01:58.041
got to thinking that we really need to understand 
the circulations of the oceans better.

01:59.320 --> 02:25.716
that there ought to be a fairly comprehensive 
program that looked at currents over fairly large

01:59.320 --> 02:25.716
areas of the ocean with current meters and so on 
that had acoustics in it that you could compare it

01:59.320 --> 02:25.716
with what the acoustics paths were and look at it 
acoustically and just look at a bigger piece of the

01:59.320 --> 02:25.716
ocean than the little ways that, you know, 
Essentially, at that time, all the measurements

02:26.017 --> 02:30.003
were made just at one spot. So you had to just take a 
bigger piece of the ocean and look at it different

02:30.444 --> 02:35.311
ways. And so I was kind of getting that started. And 
it was a new thrust. And I wanted to see it through.

02:43.784 --> 02:49.272
And I was working a little bit on trying to 
reorganize oceanography in the Navy. So

02:49.312 --> 02:55.281
I was enjoying life in Washington. didn't think 
much about leaving. After that, that summer, Gil

02:59.432 --> 03:17.434
McClellan and I came up to Woods Hole and spent a 
week up here talking

02:59.432 --> 03:17.434
to people about doing this, and it looked like 
Woods Hole was kind of the logical place to do it

02:59.432 --> 03:17.434
because there were more people interested in it 
here than anywhere else. And I brought my wife up

03:18.876 --> 03:21.640
with me at the time. We kind of got to like it up here 
the week we spent here. I asked her whether she

03:26.848 --> 03:33.255
liked it so much she'd like to live up here and she 
said she thought she could. So I went back and

03:33.696 --> 03:38.001
thought about it a little more and called Paul up. 
This must have been nearly a year after he asked me

03:38.482 --> 03:45.931
to come up here and I said, are you still interested 
in having me come up here? He said, sure. So I

03:46.972 --> 03:48.975
decided to come up. This was a little bit of a 
personal thing for me, too, because I'd gotten

03:53.598 --> 04:01.688
divorced and remarried about a year or so earlier. 
And I think it made me, I'd stayed in Washington

04:03.089 --> 04:14.123
long enough that things had settled down after 
that period, but then I felt like I'd like to kind of

04:03.089 --> 04:14.123
start over again somewhere else. And I think that 
all had a part in the decision to come up here.

04:19.619 --> 04:23.364
starting out sort of a new life and a new career all 
at the same time. And Woods Hole looked like a nice

04:25.226 --> 04:27.148
place to do it. There were a lot of opportunities 
here and a great group of people to work with. And I

04:32.114 --> 04:38.382
had a chance to follow through on the kind of 
program that I was interested in there in the Navy.

04:38.402 --> 04:46.892
Although it's not my particular field of interest 
doing work, I was interested in the program.

04:46.990 --> 04:55.500
buoy program that is up here developed out of that 
and it's just made major strides in understanding

04:46.990 --> 04:55.500
the oceans. Did, did you, except for this idea, 
what other sorts of ideas did you try to bring to

04:55.520 --> 05:02.328
Woods Hole when you came as an administrator? Oh, I 
uh, I think uh, I, the main thing I think I thought

05:02.348 --> 05:14.483
was the uh, the kind of feeling that uh, that you 
really had to be doing the best science no matter

05:15.560 --> 05:25.374
what you're doing here, and that you really worked 
on quality at all times. You're getting the best

05:25.414 --> 05:29.420
people here, and we strive for that. It's 
something the institution has always done, tried

05:29.460 --> 05:42.478
to get the very best people here and develop a good 
research program no matter in which area it's in.

05:43.353 --> 05:57.926
followed through a little bit on geophysics since 
I've been up here, and I used to go to sea more often

05:43.353 --> 05:57.926
than I do now, because I still have an interest in 
geophysics, and I think I still have an impact on

05:43.353 --> 05:57.926
the programs up here. As a matter of fact, I spent 
most of the morning discussing some of our

05:57.946 --> 06:12.600
programs that we're going to do, and I think I have 
some input to shaping these, and although I don't

05:57.946 --> 06:12.600
take part in them myself, I feel like I have fairly 
good input into deciding what's going on or

06:13.188 --> 06:21.017
helping decide what's going on. Well, I have a 
couple of questions, one of which you can ignore

06:21.037 --> 06:25.522
and one which I don't want you to ignore. First of 
all, it seems to me Woods Hole stresses more than

06:25.542 --> 06:31.589
other institutions the idea of students going to 
see. Is that deliberate?

06:37.215 --> 06:37.495
Yes. I think the thing that we stress and going to 
see is only part of it. We take what I think is

06:44.812 --> 06:52.341
probably a little bit different look at the 
graduate students than other places. We feel very

06:52.361 --> 07:01.672
keenly that it's a transition from classroom 
learning to doing research on your own

06:52.361 --> 07:01.672
independently. We like to get the person involved 
in working in the laboratory on problems of his own

07:02.914 --> 07:13.266
and going to see solving these and so forth. 
de-emphasize the classroom training. We really

07:17.755 --> 07:25.387
want the guy, when he gets his degree, to be able to 
go off on his own and do a piece of research in some

07:17.755 --> 07:25.387
reasonably short period of time. Now, Scripps was 
good at doing this when I was there, but it took the

07:25.427 --> 07:32.518
average guy seven years to get through the 
business. You had a lot of courses and so on, and

07:32.538 --> 07:43.354
then you went to C. We're trying to do the same thing 
in a reasonable time that's normal in graduate

07:32.538 --> 07:43.354
schools. You know, four years is probably, four to 
five years must be a fairly normal period for going

07:43.874 --> 07:52.103
from the BS to the PhD.

07:54.626 --> 08:10.725
What we've done is cut down the amount of class work 
and got people really doing research, and that

07:54.626 --> 08:10.725
means going out to sea, getting involved with 
problems, getting your feet wet in this business,

07:54.626 --> 08:10.725
and knowing what research is, running programs. I 
think our students that have come out here are,

08:13.237 --> 08:20.546
very good, and I don't think they lack any of the 
basic skills that they get in other places. It's

08:20.566 --> 08:23.669
just a different emphasis, I think, on teaching. 
It's one of teaching them more pragmatically the

08:24.530 --> 08:31.499
kind of things that they're going to be doing when 
they get out of school. They aren't going to

08:31.779 --> 08:34.602
continue going to classes when they're out of 
school. They're going to be faced with working in a

08:34.622 --> 08:39.548
laboratory somewhere and doing research. Was 
that the question you wanted me to ignore? That's

08:43.293 --> 08:44.735
the question I wanted you to answer. I'm going to 
ask you a follow-up question on that too, but

08:44.895 --> 08:48.940
another question which you can ignore. Many of the 
older oceanographers, that is, I don't mean

08:50.942 --> 09:05.538
particularly in age exclusively, I mean those 
people who came through in earlier time in

08:50.942 --> 09:05.538
oceanography regardless of age, felt as if the sea 
experience was essential to be an oceanographer,

08:50.942 --> 09:05.538
identification with the environment. Do you feel 
that this is a necessity? Oh, absolutely. I'm one

09:10.763 --> 09:13.367
of the older ones. I'll go a little further than 
that. I think it's not only essential to go to sea,

09:15.471 --> 09:31.236
but I think an oceanographer's got to have a broad 
base of understanding that is beyond his own

09:15.471 --> 09:31.236
specialization.

09:34.372 --> 09:50.230
I feel strongly that he ought to know something 
about geology, the physical oceanography,

09:34.372 --> 09:50.230
biology, chemistry, and so forth, that this is 
just part of your education to be an

09:34.372 --> 09:50.230
oceanographer, to be able to converse in these 
other fields and know something about it. I'm

09:52.333 --> 10:01.003
afraid a lot of the places that teach oceanography 
now gets very highly specialized, and I include

09:52.333 --> 10:01.003
ourself among this. Our physical oceanographers 
here think it's a waste of time to take any biology

10:01.996 --> 10:11.706
or geology, and they want them to just take the 
advanced math courses that they need. And a

10:11.746 --> 10:15.389
student only has a limited amount of time. 
Nonetheless, we feel that even these guys that are

10:16.670 --> 10:20.875
just taking the math courses ought to go to sea. And 
you have to have some sort of feeling with the data

10:21.055 --> 10:28.442
that you're working with and the accuracy.

10:29.468 --> 10:39.665
If you're working just with numbers all the time or 
in the lab and you don't go to sea, I think you just

10:29.468 --> 10:39.665
have the wrong feel for it. Now, I also think that 
Woods Hole, probably more so than any other place,

10:39.705 --> 10:52.085
is an experimental place where people go to sea, 
more people here go to sea than probably any other

10:39.705 --> 10:52.085
oceanographic institution. That's the way we do 
things here. Everybody expects to go to sea.

10:56.847 --> 10:58.569
That's the way we do oceanography. Scripps is a 
much more highly theoretical group where a lot of

10:58.589 --> 11:07.078
people that are sitting in the labs don't go to sea 
as much. It's a different way of doing things now.

11:10.742 --> 11:17.430
I'm not saying one way is better than the other, but 
our way of doing it is the experimental way of going

11:10.742 --> 11:17.430
to sea. You know, we have a number of people that 
have grown up here that have no formal educations.

11:25.814 --> 11:44.319
Two of our department chairmen don't have their 
Ph.D.

11:25.814 --> 11:44.319
And two others that I know of that are here have 
received some of the highest awards in

11:25.814 --> 11:44.319
oceanography and have no graduate training. So 
they've just learned on-the-job training type of

11:44.339 --> 11:49.246
thing. And they're very good. They're just 
first-rate. And I think that's something... that

11:55.058 --> 12:03.405
it's difficult to do now, even here, but in the past 
it was difficult to do other places. Woods Hole was

12:03.425 --> 12:10.451
a place where people came and were interested in 
going to see, went to see, and became

12:03.425 --> 12:10.451
oceanographers. Yeah, this is still not the 
question, but it looks to me like academic

12:10.471 --> 12:20.580
training and institutional organization works 
against your theory. It's almost as if everything

12:24.083 --> 12:30.751
in the academic world, including your own 
institution, is becoming more rather than less

12:24.083 --> 12:30.751
specialized. Oh, I think you're right on that, and 
a number of us don't agree with that, but we don't

12:30.771 --> 12:40.582
prevail either. I think, as a matter of fact, I 
think the institution is very nearly 50-50 split

12:42.724 --> 12:53.837
on this, and what we do is let each group kind of go 
its own. The physical oceanographers have tended

12:55.834 --> 12:58.998
to be very narrow. Some of the others tend to be much 
broader. And I'd like to encourage the broadness,

13:03.984 --> 13:08.891
but we don't force it on anybody. We have classes 
open to everybody. We say on their exams they're

13:12.656 --> 13:18.964
going to be responsible for knowing this, but they 
don't have to take courses now. I went to school at

13:19.838 --> 13:26.326
Scripps, and all the courses in the basic subjects 
were mandatory there. I would much prefer that

13:26.666 --> 13:33.174
here, and a number of other people would prefer it 
here. Mostly people that are graduates of

13:33.194 --> 13:37.238
Scripps, I might add, feel strongly this way. But 
some of the other people here feel very strongly

13:37.319 --> 13:45.989
that you want to keep it narrow.

13:46.009 --> 13:48.732
So we've got kind of an in-between. course on that, 
and I think it's probably a healthy course.

13:52.768 --> 13:54.991
There's arguments for both sides on this. The time 
is limited, and whether you give a guy a broad

13:56.192 --> 14:08.806
general education or you specialize in which is 
the best way to train him in order that he can

13:56.192 --> 14:08.806
compete in today's market, I'm not sure. In any 
case, going to sea broadens a person, so that's a

14:09.266 --> 14:15.833
real advantage to get them out at sea. And I don't 
know whether you've had a chance to talk to any of

14:16.808 --> 14:19.632
our students here. No. We have a great group of 
students, and I'm sorry you didn't get to talk to

14:19.892 --> 14:27.743
Fran Shepard while he was here, or maybe you have 
talked to him. I've not talked to him. I'm going to

14:28.604 --> 14:30.627
try to find him at Scripps in November. Because he 
met with our students, and he told me he thought it

14:30.647 --> 14:35.934
was a great group of students here. He was really 
impressed by it. Did you have any problems making,

14:39.159 --> 14:44.486
doing your tenure here? Did you have any problems 
making it? what amounts to not a major shift, I

14:46.357 --> 15:00.277
don't mean to imply that, but certainly a movement 
to the left, where you turned from what had been

14:46.357 --> 15:00.277
primarily a research institution into one that 
was a combination teaching research

14:46.357 --> 15:00.277
institution? Oh, yes. This has not come easy at 
all. This was just taking place when I came to Woods

15:03.721 --> 15:14.777
Hole, and that was essentially under one of the 
conditions I came that we would push in that

15:15.449 --> 15:20.954
direction of making it an educational as well as a 
research institution. Surprisingly, there was

15:21.355 --> 15:25.899
objection within the Navy to see us go. They 
preferred to see us continue just being solely a

15:26.600 --> 15:29.723
research. However, we had a special committee of 
our trustees set up to look at the question. They

15:36.289 --> 15:39.652
decided that we ought to get involved formally in 
education.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.477
We made this decision. had our charter changed to 
allow us to give a degree. We have had students here

15:48.482 --> 15:57.872
through the whole history of the institution, but 
usually they were somebody else's students,

15:48.482 --> 15:57.872
Brown's or Harvard's or MIT's or something. And we 
wanted a group that—we wanted to make sure that

15:57.892 --> 16:10.026
they'd continue coming here, because there were 
new centers of oceanography being set up

15:57.892 --> 16:10.026
everywhere. We were afraid that each of these 
schools would set up their own groups and we'd end

16:10.478 --> 16:15.207
up with no students here. And students are just the 
lifeblood of any research organization. They're

16:20.676 --> 16:23.562
the new ideas and the enthusiasm that comes in.

16:26.647 --> 16:34.782
And so, in essence, what we wanted to do was have a 
mechanism that would ensure that we had students,

16:26.647 --> 16:34.782
had our charter changed, We decided about that 
stage of the game that it made a lot of sense to join

16:35.690 --> 16:43.343
with MIT in a joint program, which has been 
successful. And they had their charter changed at

16:43.383 --> 16:49.092
the same time, so we could both give a single degree 
jointly. And our student has grown up to, we have

16:51.096 --> 16:55.623
about 80 at the present time. And it's a very 
healthy, it didn't come without pains. A lot of the

17:01.899 --> 17:06.363
older staff members objected to it, still object 
to it, and won't participate. Very few of the

17:07.244 --> 17:12.149
younger people object to it, and they're the ones 
that are most active in it. So, in the long run,

17:12.169 --> 17:17.253
it'll all wash out and nobody will notice this 
transition. So, and I suspect that's, that's Paul

17:17.494 --> 17:28.444
Fye's major accomplishment since being director 
is getting the education program. I think he would

17:30.044 --> 17:31.727
probably think that, too. It's going to be the one 
that will have the most lasting effect on the

17:32.388 --> 17:35.593
institution. Well, your question. What 
direction is your research field going? What do

17:41.783 --> 17:48.815
you think is going to be the major problem that your 
research field will have to handle in the future?

17:49.436 --> 17:52.040
The major scientific problem? The major 
scientific problem. Oh, I think... the major

17:58.495 --> 18:19.227
scientific program that is facing the 
geologists, geophysicists right now is

17:58.495 --> 18:19.227
essentially the nature of the driving mechanism 
of the seafloor spreading plate tectonics.

18:19.247 --> 18:26.899
We know a good deal about the upper layers of the 
earth, the sediments and the crust of the earth.

18:27.807 --> 18:44.182
beginning to get interested in the deeper parts,

18:27.807 --> 18:44.182
how the crust in the lithosphere and the 
athenosphere, which are the deeper layers in the

18:27.807 --> 18:44.182
earth, change from younger crust out to older 
crust, and when it goes down into a trench, what

18:27.807 --> 18:44.182
happens to it there? Is there a transition 
between, there is a transition between that

18:44.302 --> 18:49.567
oceanic and continental. Is one eventually 
transformed into the other, or what? It's this

18:55.652 --> 18:57.814
whole problem of understanding the deeper layers 
of the Earth and how they change with age, and the

18:58.098 --> 19:11.597
comparison of the oceanic with the same layers in 
the oceanic with the continental areas. And these

19:12.759 --> 19:27.379
have a multitude of ramifications to them in that 
if you understand the nature as to what's

19:12.759 --> 19:27.379
happening and the mechanisms that's driving all 
of these, it gives you a much better feeling for

19:28.169 --> 19:33.135
where you look for resources in terms of either 
minerals or petroleum and so on. Already the

19:34.256 --> 19:41.123
seafloor spreading has paid off on this and the 
whole work. I remember the first conference I went

19:42.985 --> 19:56.100
to sometime ago in Princeton where we got a bunch of 
oil companies together with a bunch of scientists

19:42.985 --> 19:56.100
talking about seafloor spreading and how it 
affects where you look for petroleum. And at that

19:57.532 --> 20:04.960
time, the petroleum companies weren't really 
much interested in that. They could cite a few

20:05.020 --> 20:23.961
examples where the wells off Nova Scotia, I guess, 
corresponded with the wells off the counterpart

20:05.020 --> 20:23.961
in North Africa or something like that, where they 
pulled apart.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.860
But there hadn't been much work. Now I think all the 
oil companies are well aware of the whole theory of

20:27.220 --> 20:40.436
plate tectonics, and it's a guiding factor in 
where they look for petroleum.

20:40.456 --> 20:52.750
I think that's a major thrust, is going to be 
understanding the nature of the

20:40.456 --> 20:52.750
dynamics of what's driving the lithosphere. And I 
suspect that's going to be difficult in coming,

20:53.455 --> 21:01.786
because we have no direct way of getting 
measurements on these. It's going to have to all be

21:01.806 --> 21:10.256
done by indirect measurements, at least in the 
foreseeable future.

21:13.941 --> 21:16.364
But then that's the way seafloor spreading came 
about. It was all indirect measurements that

21:16.404 --> 21:19.648
really discovered it. And then the drilling came 
along and it just confirmed all of these

21:24.303 --> 21:30.893
hypotheses that were put forward. Then you begin 
to get direct samples from down there, and then you

21:30.913 --> 21:36.701
could make some measurements to test out what you 
thought was right.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.268
What do you intend to do? In the future? Do you 
intend to move back into research? Well, I'd like

21:47.297 --> 21:49.420
to. On the other hand, I think I'd find it very 
difficult to keep up with some of the younger

21:53.210 --> 21:57.274
people. They're awfully bright. There's nothing 
I'd rather do than that. I worry about how I might be

22:06.383 --> 22:12.269
able to compete with them, that they have 
different skills. New groups come along. I've not

22:16.433 --> 22:20.197
followed the literature as closely as I'd like to. 
It'd be a major job to get back into it. I do hope to

22:24.199 --> 22:30.666
get a little more involved in research than I am 
now.

22:33.929 --> 22:48.364
As I said, I've been here 12 years, essentially 
doing what I'm doing now, and I think I'm getting a

22:33.929 --> 22:48.364
little stale at it, and the job's suffering, 
because I am getting a little stale at it. I ought to

22:48.384 --> 22:50.667
be thinking of doing something else. I I just don't 
have in mind what right now. I take it, though, that

22:56.627 --> 23:00.931
you foresee the remainder of your career here at 
Woods Hole. Is that fair to say? Well, I don't see

23:02.352 --> 23:08.858
any other alternatives at this time. I suspect the 
deciding factor on that will be if something comes

23:11.160 --> 23:19.848
along that's interesting enough to attract me 
somewhere else. Fair enough. Now, the last series

23:22.073 --> 23:31.048
of questions I have are sort of general questions, 
which I'd like for you to make a comment on. If you

23:32.570 --> 23:39.942
were to give advice to a young student, a student of 
science who wanted to become an oceanographer,

23:32.570 --> 23:39.942
what would you tell him to work in?

23:43.428 --> 23:44.369
What particular field? What particular field?

23:54.642 --> 23:55.043
I don't know. I guess one could answer that either 
from what you think the opportunities are or what

23:55.063 --> 24:01.972
your own biases are in this.

24:07.460 --> 24:23.181
I think I would urge that whoever was to get 
interested in oceanography ought to have a good

24:07.460 --> 24:23.181
solid background in math and physics, no matter 
what field they use. getting into. I think this is

24:24.859 --> 24:29.303
just sort of a fundamental thing that they should 
have. Now, there are a lot of interesting things

24:29.343 --> 24:38.853
going on in the chemistry and certainly the 
geology and geophysics. I find a lot of

24:38.873 --> 24:41.295
challenging things still going on there. The 
physical oceanography is interesting. The one

24:46.100 --> 24:54.028
area that I wouldn't recommend people to get into, 
and that's only because there are so many people in

24:46.100 --> 24:54.028
it, is biology. For some reason, biology attracts 
more people than the other fields. And there are

25:01.843 --> 25:07.190
more biologists competing with one another. It's 
not that the field isn't interesting or

25:07.210 --> 25:09.834
challenging. If I were advising a young person, I 
just would advise him to avoid that unless he has

25:09.934 --> 25:20.189
some extreme interests or talents in biology. And 
there's no doubt that anybody who's good in any of

25:20.209 --> 25:25.416
these fields will make their way.

25:33.114 --> 25:45.951
I suspect the field of oceanography that's going 
to do the most in the future is what one might call

25:33.114 --> 25:45.951
engineering or applied. It's the untapped area.

25:52.059 --> 25:54.002
I think what I mean by this is essentially taking 
all the knowledge that's gained from the physical

25:55.990 --> 26:22.352
oceanographer, the chemists, the biologists, 
geologists, and so on, and translating these

25:55.990 --> 26:22.352
things into useful ways of using the oceans, 
either through applications or through the

25:55.990 --> 26:22.352
design of equipment

25:55.990 --> 26:22.352
and processes that will utilize the oceans. I 
think this is the big area in the future where we'll

26:23.193 --> 26:34.947
see a lot of it, mainly because of the limitations 
the world is facing in resources, energy, and so

26:23.193 --> 26:34.947
forth. They're going to turn to the oceans for a lot 
of these, and that's going to be a wide open field

26:35.528 --> 26:43.718
for the engineer out there. I guess it's 
engineering in its broadest sense. Well, as a

26:48.123 --> 26:52.288
matter of fact, I anticipated my second question, 
which had to do with ocean engineering and the

26:48.123 --> 26:52.288
environment. Would you assume that ocean 
engineering, and your institution in

26:52.994 --> 27:04.770
particular, will move more and more into what 
amounts to eco-movements and eco-studies? Yes, I

27:06.913 --> 27:08.215
think so.

27:11.059 --> 27:18.529
Again, this is a trend that's happening 
everywhere.

27:21.817 --> 27:49.393
world is essentially driving us towards learning 
more about the ocean as an ecosystem and taking

27:21.817 --> 27:49.393
advantage of it I'm sure that as time goes on a 
larger and larger fraction of our work here will be

27:21.817 --> 27:49.393
in the quote the applied areas it's going to be on 
problems that people are interested in for one

27:21.817 --> 27:49.393
reason or another either for resources for 
pollution or energy or something like that, that

27:50.369 --> 27:56.957
more and more of our effort will go into that, 
either directly or indirectly. Again, this is a

27:57.878 --> 28:03.825
trend that is opposed by a good deal of our 
scientists here, particularly the older group

27:57.878 --> 28:03.825
again. They kind of like to see their grant come 
from NSF, and they do their thing and continue

28:03.845 --> 28:11.373
doing what they want to do. I don't think this is 
going to be possible. The world is changing, and

28:14.878 --> 28:17.621
people have to change with it. And that's the way 
it's changing. toward the more applied. I think if

28:23.337 --> 28:30.105
we're to survive as a first-rate institution, 
we're going to have to change with the world.

28:31.427 --> 28:31.907
Follow this. And do more applied research. Do more 
applied. Do you think Sea Grant will play a larger

28:36.072 --> 28:42.820
and larger role in funding applying?

28:44.909 --> 28:45.970
Not necessarily. I think things like Sea Grant, 
unless Sea Grant changes, I don't think that's

28:46.471 --> 28:53.659
going to be necessarily the key thing.

28:56.502 --> 29:05.131
But I think research of that general nature will 
become more and more important. Now, it may grow

29:05.351 --> 29:07.293
through Sea Grant. I don't know. With Ned Estenso 
running Sea Grant, he's a very capable guy, and You

29:14.255 --> 29:21.264
might be able to generate the funding and the 
change of emphasis of Sea Grant so that that will

29:14.255 --> 29:21.264
play a major role. Certainly those kinds of 
research. I think that's a little shorter term

29:24.648 --> 29:28.113
than I'm thinking about. I look at us getting in the 
applied research, but the longer term applied

29:28.293 --> 29:37.765
research than looking right at today's problems, 
sort of anticipating tomorrow's problems. not

29:39.635 --> 29:47.949
the far-out research that's just looking at the 
understanding of what's going on, but the

29:39.635 --> 29:47.949
longer-term problems. And I don't think Sea Grant 
is putting an awful lot of its effort on that. I

29:52.497 --> 29:58.226
think the IDOE is more closely related to those 
kinds of things. It's somewhere in between those

29:58.326 --> 30:05.338
two that I suspect will have a major impact in the 
future.

30:08.474 --> 30:09.879
I'm going to turn the tape over here.
