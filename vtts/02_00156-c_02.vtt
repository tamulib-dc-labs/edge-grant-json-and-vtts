00:02.562 --> 00:27.439
very fond feelings for A&M I don't have any 
negative feelings about either my life as a

00:02.562 --> 00:27.439
student here or my professional career here uh I 
always had the uh option well I always said that

00:02.562 --> 00:27.439
when something better came along I was going to 
move on and I, you know, interviewed other places,

00:27.959 --> 00:34.992
and I looked at other jobs, and I always felt like 
that I was better off here at A&M. I was being

00:35.012 --> 00:37.137
supported better. I was being, uh, appreciated 
better. I, uh, uh, so, so all of that's, that's very

00:40.503 --> 00:47.657
positive. I, uh,

00:51.550 --> 01:07.170
I guess another way to evaluate my feelings for the 
university is that both my family and my wife's

00:51.550 --> 01:07.170
family had property in Northwest Texas and we've 
chosen to retire here, not there. We've sold that

01:07.711 --> 01:16.302
property and we'd just rather be here than 
someplace else. That's a great ending.
