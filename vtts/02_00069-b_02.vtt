WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:06.632
to run because there's so many nationalities in it.

00:07.234 --> 00:13.618
And some of the preconceived notions from the old countries, so-called, come into that a lot.

00:14.240 --> 00:19.127
And I'm assuming that each one feels theirs is the most important language.

00:19.147 --> 00:20.028
Oh, absolutely.

00:20.990 --> 00:21.711
Absolutely.

00:22.572 --> 00:32.366
You know, you could, the Spanish, of course, have it made, and they keep saying, well, look, all around, next door, Mexico, go down south, it's all Spanish, Spanish.

00:32.746 --> 00:34.749
And I said, yeah, but go across the Atlantic.

00:35.770 --> 00:41.158
Nobody speaks Spanish except a few people on that little island.

00:41.678 --> 00:43.420
part of the world in Spain.

00:45.363 --> 00:57.359
But it's become harder and harder to justify German, a lot of emphasis on German, because after all German is not a world language anymore, if it ever was.

00:58.381 --> 01:00.844
All right, now that leads me to a very important question.

01:03.368 --> 01:06.572
What advice would you have for the department today?

01:07.362 --> 01:17.073
If you were employed as a consultant, what advice would you give the Department of Modern Languages at Texas A&M?

01:17.093 --> 01:18.334
I might be quite radical.

01:19.135 --> 01:31.328
Advocate doing away with the European languages and substituting some of the whatever, Sri Lankan, whatever, the Asian countries, primarily because I think

01:32.759 --> 01:39.531
For Europe there are lots of people who can manage European languages.

01:39.932 --> 01:43.298
Well not necessarily at A&M but in the country at large.

01:43.919 --> 01:47.325
But there's so few people who can handle Japanese for instance.

01:48.048 --> 02:00.384
I think maybe the emphasis ought to be on the lesser known, but today, in today's world, more essential languages.

02:00.684 --> 02:03.909
Should they attempt any more graduate programs?

02:06.352 --> 02:07.133
Yes, definitely.

02:07.153 --> 02:17.346
What I would like to see, though, to have for years, is a combination graduate program for, in business and foreign languages.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.366
And how would that be?

02:23.389 --> 02:25.654
Well, it works like this.

02:26.816 --> 02:33.869
They take all the usual, learn all the usual things about business, whether it's management or... As an MBA?

02:34.871 --> 02:36.955
As an MBA or maybe even a PhD.

02:37.964 --> 02:49.762
And they would learn a great deal about the culture of various places, the business culture, the business climate, and the language.

02:50.443 --> 02:52.365
Which languages would you start that?

02:56.852 --> 03:01.018
Well, today things are in flux, aren't they?

03:02.140 --> 03:04.123
A few years ago I was in Japanese.

03:05.470 --> 03:06.411
I'm not so sure.

03:06.431 --> 03:07.933
I think today it should be Chinese.

03:09.555 --> 03:11.357
Would Spanish be?

03:12.339 --> 03:20.409
Spanish will always be important because of the business we do with Latin America.

03:20.429 --> 03:26.376
And should we emphasize Latin American Spanish or European Spanish?

03:26.456 --> 03:30.381
You know, from what I've been told by my colleagues,

03:31.458 --> 03:33.102
There isn't all that much difference.

03:33.122 --> 03:34.265
Oh, okay.

03:34.285 --> 03:38.395
So... Just a Christian tells me that, at least, and some others.

03:38.876 --> 03:42.325
He said there's never any... It's like British English and American English.

03:43.107 --> 03:45.071
If you know one, you can understand the other.

03:46.535 --> 03:47.357
But...

03:48.822 --> 03:50.324
Kind of interesting, I don't know.

03:51.105 --> 03:59.935
Another thing that's important, by the same token, we should probably not give up French, because we're doing a lot of business with Quebec.

04:00.936 --> 04:04.520
And believe it or not, Quebec corresponds, at least, in French.

04:07.023 --> 04:10.146
I think they have a law that mandates that.

04:11.267 --> 04:15.252
So it's interesting.

04:15.772 --> 04:19.337
Let's see, here's a non-Texas A&M related question.

04:20.058 --> 04:25.967
Should there be a single legal language in the United States?

04:27.109 --> 04:30.775
Should we have an official?

04:31.676 --> 04:33.419
I have a lot of friends who think so.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.286
I'm not sure.

04:39.802 --> 04:44.189
I do think everybody ought to speak English if he lives in this country, works in this country.

04:44.590 --> 04:48.036
But I'm not sure that it needs to be by law.

04:48.697 --> 04:54.587
I've been saying for a long time, if I could be the emperor, that means I don't have to explain anything to the voters.

04:54.787 --> 05:06.428
I would require that every college graduate, as a condition of graduation, must have at least a speaking language, a speaking knowledge of a second language.

05:06.448 --> 05:06.728
Yeah, exactly.

05:06.748 --> 05:08.952
That the language of the marketplace in the U.S.

05:08.972 --> 05:10.174
is English.

05:10.194 --> 05:15.664
But if I also could speak Spanish here in Texas, I could have more.

05:15.644 --> 05:16.405
Opportunities.

05:16.425 --> 05:17.767
You have far more opportunities.

05:18.448 --> 05:25.597
And if I'm going to be in the international business world, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, goodness knows.

05:26.037 --> 05:28.640
Well, you know, it used to be a strange thing.

05:29.461 --> 05:36.010
In the 19th century, people were better at speaking foreign languages than we are today.

05:38.933 --> 05:39.394
Let's see.

05:39.414 --> 05:43.019
Did you ever consider leaving A&M and taking a job elsewhere?

05:43.059 --> 05:44.200
No.

05:45.209 --> 05:45.610
Yes.

05:46.792 --> 05:47.272
I don't know.

05:48.935 --> 05:50.197
At one point I did.

05:50.257 --> 05:53.703
And I had two offers for an interview.

05:55.045 --> 05:59.493
And when the time came I got cold feet.

05:59.553 --> 06:01.656
Why did you decide you wanted to stay here?

06:02.157 --> 06:04.601
Well partly because I really liked my job here.

06:05.563 --> 06:08.247
And also because

06:09.712 --> 06:12.077
Life was very easy for me here with my children.

06:13.159 --> 06:23.398
A single mother with four kids in College Station was far better off than I would have been at Illinois Southern or University of Oregon.

06:23.799 --> 06:31.213
All right, now describe that life for a faculty, wife, mother in College Station.

06:34.670 --> 06:36.612
It's not as hard as people make it seem.

06:37.834 --> 06:41.639
I think there's an awful lot of hooey to this business.

06:45.043 --> 06:48.448
My children will tell you, we have a wonderful relationship today.

06:49.249 --> 06:52.833
Everything worked just fine for us.

06:53.093 --> 06:54.635
And you were living where in those days?

06:56.558 --> 06:57.279
College Station.

06:57.299 --> 06:58.300
No, but what street?

06:58.540 --> 07:00.783
Oh, well mainly on Glade.

07:01.064 --> 07:04.508
Okay.

07:04.943 --> 07:12.041
They could bike to school, and we never locked the front door because they'd lose the keys, and one thing and another.

07:12.421 --> 07:15.750
It was just an easy place to raise kids.

07:15.770 --> 07:18.296
And the quality of the Indian Solid School System, then?

07:18.476 --> 07:19.098
It was all right.

07:19.158 --> 07:20.742
At the time, it was pretty good.

07:21.025 --> 07:25.215
I think it was at least as good as that in other states.

07:25.596 --> 07:39.709
I've always found when two of my sons went to A&M out of Consolidated, got their degrees at A&M, I don't think they would have done any better had they gone to school elsewhere.

07:40.904 --> 07:47.613
My daughter went to the University of Texas, but didn't stay there.

07:48.674 --> 07:52.079
She was about to flunk out, so she transferred to St.

07:52.099 --> 07:59.549
Marcus and finished there, and then she went back to Austin and got a master's degree there.

08:02.032 --> 08:04.836
And the relative cost of

08:04.951 --> 08:12.860
Well that was of course, you know, I couldn't have afforded anything except a public university for my children.

08:13.020 --> 08:16.604
But the cost of living in College Station was relatively reasonable?

08:16.624 --> 08:19.488
It was relatively reasonable all along I think.

08:21.210 --> 08:27.897
The offers I had were from places like Illinois, Oregon, and Maryland.

08:27.977 --> 08:30.200
I know Maryland is much more expensive.

08:31.301 --> 08:33.844
And I didn't want to go back to the east coast no matter what.

08:35.900 --> 08:42.628
What advice would you give to a new female faculty member at Texas A&M today?

08:45.852 --> 08:47.934
Don't let anybody intimidate you.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.397
Just stand your ground.

08:51.538 --> 08:54.802
But you didn't have any problems of that, did you?

08:54.822 --> 08:56.064
Well, no, I never did.

08:56.484 --> 09:00.709
And I say I have worked in an all-male environment.

09:01.820 --> 09:13.736
for so long, first with the Army for four years, then with Allen Academy for five years, that I just took all this for granted.

09:13.876 --> 09:18.222
And I never really had a problem.

09:18.903 --> 09:23.248
Nobody ever seemed to object to women.

09:24.630 --> 09:28.215
The one thing I put my foot down pretty quickly,

09:28.702 --> 09:32.772
Anytime I was on that committee, university-wide or otherwise,

09:33.967 --> 09:38.070
Everybody would immediately insist that I become the secretary.

09:39.372 --> 09:42.754
Not from day one, but from day two on, let's say.

09:43.115 --> 09:43.915
I always refused.

09:44.536 --> 09:45.977
I don't want to be the secretary.

09:46.398 --> 09:49.440
Let Dr. So-and-so be the secretary.

09:51.101 --> 09:58.147
I did not want to get into this typical stereotyping.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.089
The woman has to be the secretary.

10:00.770 --> 10:02.891
And after you said that, did people accept it?

10:03.072 --> 10:03.552
Oh, yeah.

10:04.122 --> 10:07.890
and then somebody else.

10:08.791 --> 10:11.096
What do you think about A&M's quality today?

10:12.439 --> 10:20.595
Well, from what I can tell, because I don't have very close contacts and all, they've come a long way.

10:22.111 --> 10:32.927
And the one thing is that I find from talking to some of my friends is that I think the faculty is not as content or happy as they used to be.

10:33.908 --> 10:38.335
They feel there's more pressure and more work and more everything.

10:40.578 --> 10:43.783
But their salaries are more nationally comparable.

10:43.943 --> 10:44.584
Exactly.

10:44.925 --> 10:45.526
Exactly.

10:46.567 --> 10:48.490
And their teaching loans are nothing.

10:50.393 --> 10:55.961
When I tell them that we used to teach 18 hours, they just almost don't believe you.

10:56.883 --> 11:00.869
And how many students normally were in a section in those days?

11:01.069 --> 11:06.377
In those days, between 30 and 40, and today it's between 20 and 30.

11:08.520 --> 11:14.589
And did you have any graduate assistants in those days?

11:14.649 --> 11:19.877
As a matter of fact, when I had a graduate assistant, I hired them and paid them myself.

11:20.498 --> 11:26.104
That was later on, when I was already department head, and I was teaching one or two courses.

11:26.124 --> 11:35.493
And I really didn't want to grade all of those papers, and then hire one of our graduate students and pay him to do it.

11:37.956 --> 11:44.963
What non-academic events at A&M did you participate in, or did you attend?

11:45.624 --> 11:49.628
Well, in the early years, we had nice social activities.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.655
We had regular dances.

11:51.675 --> 11:52.796
Describe those please.

11:53.177 --> 11:54.258
Well those were interesting.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.340
Everybody came all dressed up.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.402
We had an orchestra.

11:59.504 --> 12:00.405
What was his name?

12:02.167 --> 12:02.687
I forget.

12:03.248 --> 12:04.790
Anyway we had a live orchestra.

12:07.332 --> 12:09.114
Where was the dance held?

12:09.214 --> 12:11.837
At the old MSC, I mean the old part of it.

12:12.098 --> 12:12.798
The ballroom?

12:13.699 --> 12:14.160
Ballroom.

12:15.581 --> 12:17.944
And well that was always fun.

12:19.207 --> 12:26.319
Did you go to Bonfire and Muster?

12:26.339 --> 12:28.303
I did for many, many years.

12:29.425 --> 12:32.270
I've given up the last 15 or so.

12:33.432 --> 12:35.656
Did you ever go to Silver Taps?

12:36.096 --> 12:37.839
Yeah.

12:37.859 --> 12:39.983
What did you feel about those events?

12:41.060 --> 12:44.865
Well, I felt that as if I were in a strange world.

12:45.626 --> 12:50.272
I had been to various other schools and visited and been involved.

12:50.553 --> 12:53.256
I'd never seen anything like what A&M has.

12:54.518 --> 13:05.953
I think in view of our tragedy with the bonfire, it's a very good idea to think about what a tradition means.

13:06.389 --> 13:09.373
Whether it's worthwhile, whether it's good, whether it's bad.

13:11.136 --> 13:13.118
Certain traditions at A&M were horrible.

13:13.419 --> 13:19.908
I was horrified when I found out some of my students could barely sit down because their rear ends were sore.

13:20.548 --> 13:22.771
That was in my very early days.

13:23.252 --> 13:24.354
I couldn't believe it.

13:26.056 --> 13:29.361
That was a tradition that we didn't need.

13:31.483 --> 13:35.569
But I think, you know,

13:37.338 --> 13:43.387
Some of these other things, I had never been 100% on the bonfire.

13:44.648 --> 13:57.647
And the reason for that is that every year about that time, my students stopped coming to class, or they would come back with a broken leg or something, limping.

13:58.468 --> 14:03.295
It interfered too much with what I felt I was there to do with them.

14:04.996 --> 14:17.815
I would have preferred bonfire like what the University of Texas used to have, or a little bit more like what the high schools have, a pile of old something, wood and lighting.

14:17.835 --> 14:23.202
You can be just as cheerful about that ever since my spirit.

14:24.404 --> 14:31.915
But I always resented the amount of time and labor that went into the bonfire.

14:33.059 --> 14:43.056
There seemed to be a school spirit, a pride at A&M.

14:43.937 --> 14:45.500
What contributes to that?

14:46.001 --> 14:48.445
How has that developed?

14:48.465 --> 14:55.557
Well, I think it basically goes back to a much, much earlier era when everybody was in the Corps.

14:56.009 --> 15:04.192
Everybody lived in the dorms on campus, and they formed a very strong bond.

15:05.897 --> 15:11.453
And somehow this carried over, but not to the same extent, I'm sure.

15:12.783 --> 15:27.637
When the discussions were going on about co-education and voluntary core and racial integration, what did you and your faculty friends think about those possible changes?

15:27.917 --> 15:28.898
They were all four of them.

15:29.559 --> 15:39.668
Number one, in the department, everybody felt if they admitted women, we'd have more and better students, which turned out to be true.

15:41.588 --> 15:44.673
The optional corps was also very popular.

15:45.374 --> 15:51.443
For some reason liberal arts people basically don't like the corps, not anything military I guess.

15:52.404 --> 15:56.010
And the less of it there was, the better they liked it.

15:56.771 --> 15:57.592
And integration?

15:58.614 --> 16:01.078
Integration, nobody even talked about it.

16:01.138 --> 16:02.540
It was just a given.

16:03.261 --> 16:04.743
It was coming, everybody knew it.

16:05.224 --> 16:06.726
And higher admission requirements?

16:08.970 --> 16:10.532
Admission requirements?

16:12.622 --> 16:28.386
I think we always felt, most of us felt, that they needed to be raised if we wanted to end up with a product that we'd be proud of.

16:28.990 --> 16:44.252
Because we really, 30, 40 years ago, got some good old little boys off the ranch or farm, and we were supposed to turn them into what, international, something with us, bankers or something.

16:44.632 --> 16:46.655
It was a little unrealistic.

16:47.376 --> 16:51.542
So I think it needs this broadening.

16:52.764 --> 16:55.808
What was your perception of Earl Rudder as the president?

16:57.577 --> 17:00.241
I admired him very much.

17:01.422 --> 17:05.989
I knew his wife Margaret better than I knew him personally.

17:06.629 --> 17:20.108
But I'm always impressed with a man who listens and a man who does what is best in spite of his own convictions.

17:20.543 --> 17:28.637
Because the man must have admitted to himself, maybe I'm wrong on this, but I'm going to do it the right way.

17:29.739 --> 17:31.041
You said you knew Mrs. Rudder.

17:31.061 --> 17:32.644
Describe your friendship with her.

17:32.704 --> 17:35.869
Oh, she's a delightful person.

17:36.153 --> 17:50.814
I have over the years translated a good many letters, French letters for her, because you know she has those contacts in Normandy and keeps, kept getting, I guess she still keeps getting a lot of the letters.

17:51.415 --> 17:57.424
And every now and then she would ask me to translate them, so I would and that was fun.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.185
Oh very good.

17:59.187 --> 18:03.493
If you ever had an opportunity with her today,

18:03.693 --> 18:06.617
encourage her not to give those away.

18:07.919 --> 18:17.392
Ann, the daughter, has told me, and Ann Wyatt has told me, that occasionally some stranger will go talk to Mrs. Rudder and will talk her out of some of those materials.

18:18.414 --> 18:25.183
And what I want her to do is to give, if not the originals, at least copies to the archive.

18:25.203 --> 18:25.784
Yeah, absolutely.

18:25.824 --> 18:27.026
So they'll be saved forever.

18:27.046 --> 18:27.586
She hasn't done it?

18:27.606 --> 18:27.887
No.

18:28.928 --> 18:32.333
She's saying, I don't know what to do with all of Earl's papers.

18:32.802 --> 18:34.283
And I said, please, please, please.

18:34.304 --> 18:34.704
Just give them.

18:34.944 --> 18:35.204
Yes.

18:35.905 --> 18:38.127
And that's what I wanted to say to you too.

18:38.428 --> 18:52.642
If at any point you have any A&M materials that you are willing to part with, please give either the originals or copies to the archives because now in the Cushing Library there is space.

18:53.062 --> 18:54.184
Yeah.

18:54.244 --> 18:56.726
My daughter-in-law works at the Cushing Library.

18:56.746 --> 18:58.148
Oh, oh, okay.

18:58.228 --> 19:00.230
And she works in the, what is it, rare books.

19:00.790 --> 19:01.611
Oh, good.

19:01.591 --> 19:04.636
But I think she's about to do something else.

19:04.656 --> 19:06.779
She's been going back to school.

19:07.541 --> 19:12.348
She's becoming, she's almost finished, a computer programmer.

19:14.151 --> 19:15.333
They make more money than librarians?

19:15.353 --> 19:19.740
They make more money than the library helpers or whatever.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.585
All right, now I'm about through with the topics I had thought of.

19:22.665 --> 19:27.733
What have we not touched on that you wanted to be sure to include?

19:29.502 --> 19:32.325
I think we've really pretty much covered it.

19:32.966 --> 19:33.667
Okay.

19:37.712 --> 19:54.632
One thing that really doesn't belong in here, I don't think, but that happened at one time was that there was a certain amount of animosity between various departments, particularly some departments are very

19:57.751 --> 20:01.476
They want to hoard a bunch of courses for themselves.

20:02.197 --> 20:03.138
You know how that goes.

20:03.899 --> 20:17.557
But I remember that when we were within the College of Liberal Arts discussing, we made a proposal about foreign literature translation.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.003
And we had a heck of a time with the English people.

20:23.772 --> 20:27.777
Because they felt that was their area.

20:27.797 --> 20:34.345
And we went round and round on that and eventually sort of settled.

20:34.365 --> 20:35.927
They got some and we got some.

20:37.049 --> 20:43.177
But there's always a certain amount of competition, which is perhaps very good.

20:44.218 --> 20:47.502
Were there any departments that you all considered your allies?

20:51.262 --> 21:02.436
Well, hopefully, we hoped that we'd have the college behind us, but we knew we didn't have economics behind us.

21:03.337 --> 21:19.918
Although one of my colleagues in the department, Payne Hanson, John Hanson in the department, he was always very supportive, but he's more of a historian than an economist anyway.

21:19.898 --> 21:24.047
It's a very interesting thing, by the way.

21:24.949 --> 21:31.683
So many of the people, the women particularly, in my department had husbands in other departments.

21:32.846 --> 21:37.215
They were almost all two people.

21:37.195 --> 21:40.760
family, A&M family.

21:40.780 --> 21:46.248
And that helped them sometimes to understand the realities of the departmental differences?

21:46.268 --> 21:46.649
Yes, definitely.

21:47.189 --> 21:50.354
And understand why they got so much money.

21:50.855 --> 21:54.580
I know that Teolani at one point

21:55.370 --> 21:58.254
was horrified how little money we were given for something.

21:58.794 --> 22:02.439
And she said, well, in the chemistry department, they would have gotten 20 times done.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.942
And I said, yep, those are the facts of life.

22:07.225 --> 22:24.567
But it actually helped us get good faculty, because we had several people who wrote when we contacted them that they would be interested in a position only if they could find a position for the spouse.

22:25.103 --> 22:27.672
And sometimes you all benefited from that?

22:27.732 --> 22:34.235
We benefited from that, or we did what we could with another department.

22:34.255 --> 22:36.683
And sometimes were you all the

22:37.405 --> 22:42.633
the principal and the spouse found and other times the principal was somewhere else.

22:42.653 --> 22:42.913
Right.

22:43.214 --> 22:44.255
It happened both ways.

22:44.716 --> 22:49.684
And it happened that we hired the woman and we had to find a spot for the husband too.

22:51.166 --> 22:52.228
It happened both ways.

22:52.288 --> 22:57.135
It wasn't just a group of women who got hired because their husbands had jobs.

22:57.155 --> 22:58.317
It worked both ways.

23:00.878 --> 23:05.385
All right, my next to the last gift then is this question is this.

23:06.026 --> 23:12.495
Let's make believe that someone comes up to you and gives you a $1 million check with one requirement.

23:13.116 --> 23:19.526
You must give that to Texas A&M, but you decide what they are to do with it.

23:19.546 --> 23:27.257
What would you have A&M, if you had the capability to give a large gift, what would you want them to use it for?

23:28.688 --> 23:38.434
That's a very difficult question actually because you have to trust the people to use the money wisely after they get it, whoever that is.

23:40.158 --> 23:43.086
But you could, under this, you could specify.

23:43.370 --> 23:49.578
I would improve the facilities for the foreign language department.

23:50.740 --> 23:54.265
I would try to bring them up to the level of the University of Texas.

23:54.805 --> 24:05.159
Have their own building, have the latest cutting edge equipment, the best faculty available.

24:06.161 --> 24:08.584
Generally just raise up the whole thing.

24:08.564 --> 24:10.227
Okay.

24:10.247 --> 24:11.348
Then my last question.

24:11.849 --> 24:14.754
What feelings do you have about Texas A&M in your heart?

24:15.495 --> 24:18.880
Oh, I, you know, I got one degree at A&M.

24:18.900 --> 24:19.541
That's just enough.

24:21.084 --> 24:24.028
Actually, I love A&M.

24:24.930 --> 24:27.273
And I've been very, very happy at A&M.

24:30.518 --> 24:32.461
Maybe I would have been just as happy somewhere else.

24:32.561 --> 24:33.122
I don't know.

24:33.984 --> 24:35.466
But I've been extremely

24:36.813 --> 24:41.400
content with my decision to remain here.

24:44.244 --> 24:44.925
I'm not sure.

24:44.945 --> 24:53.597
I wish that we could develop the liberal arts faster.

24:53.637 --> 24:55.600
I know they're trying now to do something.

24:56.301 --> 25:01.228
But for 40 years, it's been two steps forward, one step back.

25:02.430 --> 25:06.195
And I would like to see that take off completely.

25:06.175 --> 25:09.861
Are you proud to have been the first woman department head?

25:09.881 --> 25:10.142
Oh yes.

25:11.203 --> 25:15.911
You know, actually before me there were some women at A&M.

25:16.753 --> 25:18.756
I don't know if you knew Mehta Brown.

25:19.878 --> 25:22.843
She was a very famous geneticist.

25:22.863 --> 25:24.606
But she wasn't a department head though.

25:24.670 --> 25:29.315
She wasn't a department head, and she never even did any undergraduate teaching.

25:29.335 --> 25:34.521
She had some graduate students as assistants who worked with them.

25:35.762 --> 25:39.586
And even so, full professors.

25:40.447 --> 25:45.653
At the time I retired, there were only four of us, I think, full professors.

25:46.073 --> 25:47.895
And I was still the only department head.

25:51.039 --> 25:54.002
So it really hasn't gone very fast.

25:55.248 --> 26:09.161
I know some people were hoping that after me there'd be a real faster acceptance of women in leadership positions, but it's been pretty slow.

26:10.342 --> 26:12.464
And most of it, again, has been in liberal arts.

26:14.246 --> 26:15.787
But we have made some progress.

26:16.288 --> 26:17.249
There are some others.

26:17.269 --> 26:23.955
There's a woman in engineering and there are a few people here and there.

26:24.762 --> 26:28.265
compared to other universities, we lag behind.

26:29.867 --> 26:32.169
That's one thing that I know for a fact.

26:33.451 --> 26:40.638
And on the other hand, some other universities fall into the other extreme.

26:41.278 --> 26:43.560
They're practically all females on the faculty.

26:45.042 --> 26:47.765
The University of Texas today is loaded with women.

26:48.145 --> 26:50.247
Is that right?

26:52.319 --> 26:54.722
Well, there's so many good ones on the market.

26:58.467 --> 26:58.947
I don't know.

26:59.027 --> 27:01.110
I never thought I would end up as department head.

27:01.591 --> 27:04.514
I've always wanted to teach at the college level.

27:05.355 --> 27:08.620
That's been my goal all my life.

27:09.300 --> 27:16.189
I never thought I'd get to it because when I first came here I couldn't get a job at A&M because we had an anti-nepotism rule.

27:17.531 --> 27:20.875
And that kept me out.

27:22.677 --> 27:27.704
So I might have ended up at A&M earlier if I could have.

27:27.724 --> 27:29.887
I was just as qualified as I was later.

27:30.147 --> 27:35.295
Thank goodness we made that progress.

27:37.558 --> 27:37.718
Yeah.

27:37.738 --> 27:43.746
And I tried to basically, I've always tried to encourage my female faculty.

27:43.766 --> 27:50.035
I think they needed a little bit more hand-holding and comforting than the others.

27:51.078 --> 28:03.737
Women, in the beginning, they felt very uncertain of their role, and I think they tended to cave in easily, which is something I never could.

28:05.139 --> 28:20.562
I've always been outspoken, and people who know me well would tell you that it didn't matter if it hurt my career or what, I couldn't tell it the way I saw it.

28:20.643 --> 28:25.583
I was not going to be the token woman on the faculty.

28:27.229 --> 28:29.117
That's a good summary.
