WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:10.258
formerly either manager or assistant city 
manager in Long Beach before he went to Phoenix. So

00:10.278 --> 00:11.961
he was not a homegrown product. You know what 
happened to the city planner in Long Beach? No. He

00:16.867 --> 00:17.849
ended up in jail. Oh, is that right? Yes, for fraud. 
And Bob Paternoster came out from Pittsburgh to

00:22.094 --> 00:30.105
take over and give planning a good name again in 
Long Beach. That was a real scandal in the Southern

00:31.368 --> 00:35.111
California planning circle.

00:39.615 --> 00:41.837
We're getting a far field from Texas. Moved to Fort 
Worth in the summer of 1964.

00:49.844 --> 00:55.029
Was planning director under Jerry Brownlee, a 
Cookingham protege. And unfortunately, about a

00:56.691 --> 01:00.514
year and nine months After I got on the scene, Jerry 
Brownlee decided to look to greener pastures in

01:01.118 --> 01:08.547
private business. And he went with the Justin 
family

01:09.448 --> 01:19.519
as a private venture operation. But he was also 
involved with various interests in cattle

01:28.439 --> 01:33.126
wholesale, grocery, and so on in a management 
role. So he did very well for himself. And I think

01:34.488 --> 01:35.349
it's his son. Jerry Brownlee was very positive 
about planning, as of course LP Cookingham has

01:36.832 --> 01:41.939
been over the years.

01:46.166 --> 01:55.560
We were instrumental finally in Fort Worth in 
getting the concept of sector planning

01:46.166 --> 01:55.560
established. this as a device for the development 
of our own comprehensive plan. The sector

02:04.695 --> 02:15.930
planning process literally said for each of some 
eight or nine major sectors in the city, the

02:04.695 --> 02:15.930
planning studies, in-depth planning studies 
would be done. Then through a process of involving

02:16.470 --> 02:25.362
a sector planning council composed of citizens 
from the community, from that community,

02:26.033 --> 02:30.437
property owners primarily, but residents in 
general. We would then thrash out various aspects

02:30.457 --> 02:36.382
of the plan. We had a general framework plan for the 
community in terms of housing, circulation,

02:36.603 --> 02:53.458
commercial industrial generators, and 
recreation facilities. Those were the four main.

02:55.582 --> 02:57.284
elements that we used to guide. How had that been 
developed, that plan? Well, that was primarily

03:00.366 --> 03:07.873
statements of principle rather than physical 
delineation. And all that we said was, here are the

03:07.893 --> 03:11.376
observable patterns. These are in place today. 
Now, if we're going to work in a given sector, and

03:13.899 --> 03:23.968
these are certain principles that need to be 
observed, and which were commonly accepted about

03:13.899 --> 03:23.968
density and things of that sort. The Gruen Plan had 
already been developed. Gruen Plan had already

03:26.886 --> 03:34.754
been and gone in Fort Worth. But had left an impact. 
Had left an impact, but as people around Fort Worth

03:36.737 --> 03:52.774
were quick to point out, the Gruen Plan, or Gruen, 
left more grandchildren than was a child that was

03:53.952 --> 04:00.059
living. The Bruin Plan from Fort Worth never came 
to fruition. But that, in turn, spawned lots and

04:04.604 --> 04:14.676
lots of communities that adapted the concepts to 
their own local situation. In that sense, it was a

04:14.696 --> 04:18.039
very influential project. Yes, just not so 
influential for Fort Worth. The reason for that,

04:23.281 --> 04:30.629
and I arrived on the scene a couple of years after 
the major impact of the Gruen Plan. The reason for

04:31.530 --> 04:44.684
that was that the Gruen Plan was subsidized by 
private interest and the public agencies were

04:31.530 --> 04:44.684
told, keep your nose out of it. We don't want to hear 
from the public agencies. We don't want to know

04:49.009 --> 04:52.292
anything from the public community about what 
ought to be in this. We are doing this for the

04:54.122 --> 04:56.425
business community. And when it was all done, it 
was handed to the council and said, here's your

04:57.086 --> 05:02.153
plan for the CBD. It was basically funded by the 
power company, wasn't it? Correct. Texas

05:11.746 --> 05:16.973
Electric Service Company and a couple of the banks 
were the prime movers in that. I was in Victor's

05:16.993 --> 05:21.739
office in Beverly Hills about the time you went to 
Fort Worth, It worked for Victor for about a year.

05:27.686 --> 05:42.191
The plan could have been accomplished had the 
business interests said, we want more than just

05:27.686 --> 05:42.191
factual information about the community. We want 
to involve him. But those were not his marching

05:45.698 --> 05:50.322
orders, or that was not the way he conceived his 
work to be. And of course, Victor Grun's a very

05:50.742 --> 05:53.185
strong personality. And that project was 
reported at $50,000 for that CBD study. Cheap.

06:05.775 --> 06:09.499
Yeah, even at that time, that was a fairly cheap 
kind of thing. What was lacking, though, was a

06:09.519 --> 06:15.604
sense of commitment on the part of the downtown 
interest to support it when it came to such things

06:16.293 --> 06:22.861
as bridges and parking garages and the 
underground system and all of that. Servicing.

06:24.823 --> 06:26.445
That's where it fell. Well, Victor brought to that 
job a lot of previous experience in shopping

06:26.465 --> 06:33.473
center design. And he treated the CBD as a gigantic 
shopping center. That's right. And as you say, it

06:40.521 --> 06:45.287
probably would have worked if he had had the 
cooperation of everybody. Well, part of that may

06:47.258 --> 07:10.043
have also been a little bit of a reaction by 
property owner interests in downtown who did not

06:47.258 --> 07:10.043
feel themselves completely as if they were being 
treated equitably by the big businesses, namely

06:47.258 --> 07:10.043
the power company and the banks. And at that time, 
you have to keep in mind there were a lot of very,

07:12.098 --> 07:20.006
very small property owners in downtown Fort 
Worth. I mean, there were places that had only 30

07:20.026 --> 07:23.530
foot of building. So to that extent, I don't know 
that Gruen really dealt with the dynamics of a

07:24.751 --> 07:39.726
situation, perhaps never even tried to put 
together in his own mind or his staff the model of

07:40.988 --> 07:48.436
the dynamics that would be necessary in order to 
get these property owners all committed to

07:40.988 --> 07:48.436
something. He felt, I'm sure, that he had the major 
ones, and that was sufficient. But there were too

07:53.081 --> 07:57.705
many little ones in there that just simply 
thwarted things. And not deliberately, it was

07:58.366 --> 08:02.490
just they felt they were being sort of thrown to the 
wolves. Yes, and then, you know, having worked in

08:03.211 --> 08:10.759
his shop in Beverly Hills, it's clear to me that 
anyone involved on that project. I wasn't

08:13.174 --> 08:14.255
involved on that. That was before I came into the 
office. But clearly, the tradition in the office

08:17.038 --> 08:23.744
was to approach these things as a physical design 
project. And anything related to economics and

08:24.945 --> 08:33.754
the social aspects of it were handled by the front 
office, if they were handled at all. Oh, I see.

08:36.437 --> 08:38.198
Well, they weren't handled in Fort Worth. I mean, 
that was just... I think

08:40.760 --> 08:46.526
it was typical of planning in general at the time. 
Yeah, an awful lot of it. And in fact, in that

08:48.548 --> 08:57.418
respect, Hal Wise was really unique

08:48.548 --> 08:57.418
in his way of doing things. That's one reason I have 
a lot of appreciation for what Hal did in Austin,

08:57.438 --> 09:09.231
because even to this day, I have bumped into people 
in Austin who still talk about Hal Wise's work.

09:09.565 --> 09:17.517
Whether they liked it or didn't like it, he is 
identified as having listened to people. Harry

09:17.537 --> 09:21.343
Halliton was maybe a little too brusque with 
people. But that was Harry's nature. And they had a

09:24.728 --> 09:33.521
little trouble understanding this fellow from 
Northern California that seemed to not quite

09:24.728 --> 09:33.521
appreciate the parochialism of the Austin 
community. Hal could tune into that very quickly.

09:37.668 --> 09:37.868
Oh, yeah. Well, he wore his cowboy boots. Well, 
sure. But he also listened to people. And people

09:45.432 --> 09:47.475
knew that he was listening. Harry listened, but 
they didn't know he was listening. And they might

09:52.622 --> 09:58.430
arrive at the same judgment when it was all said and 
done, except the public didn't know that Harry was

09:52.622 --> 09:58.430
listening. And that makes a lot of difference. The 
things that happened in Fort Worth as a result of

10:06.232 --> 10:13.083
the sector planning program was that Howard 
McMahon had become city manager. He expected the

10:13.564 --> 10:21.016
sector planning program to be wrapped up in a 
matter of two and a half to three years. We had said

10:23.520 --> 10:31.733
to him in our several budget proposals, if you want 
this plan, to be more than a document to be sitting

10:33.704 --> 10:37.630
on your shelf. You've got to involve the people. If 
the people are going to be involved, then they have

10:40.435 --> 10:45.422
to feel ownership. They are not going to feel 
ownership overnight. And he said, well, go tell

10:49.969 --> 10:52.293
them what they need to know. And I said, Howard, it 
doesn't work that way. He said, but you have the

10:57.521 --> 10:59.845
backing of my office. Go tell them. I said, but 
Howard, they have to wrestle with the hard issues.

11:07.391 --> 11:10.555
And they're going to come back with questions for 
you. And you may find some of the questions are

11:10.575 --> 11:18.705
causing you some discomfort. And he said, well, go 
tell them what the plan should be. And

11:23.170 --> 11:31.200
philosophically, I found myself increasingly at 
odds with that philosophy of city government city

11:31.923 --> 11:34.507
management, the style. Top-down thing. Yep, 
strictly top-down. It just didn't gee with my way

11:38.473 --> 11:42.099
of doing things. And some of that's because of Andy 
Force inculcating in me the sense of appreciation

11:42.600 --> 11:59.787
of listening to the public and getting them to not 
only speak their minds, but also to come up with

11:42.600 --> 11:59.787
ideas and suggestions And as Andy used to say, and 
he came out of a background of working in New

12:00.155 --> 12:19.376
Jersey, some of the small communities in New 
Jersey, and he worked under Segoe for some period

12:00.155 --> 12:19.376
of time, and then moved, in fact, to Tucson to work 
under Segoe, originally when Segoe did the

12:00.155 --> 12:19.376
planning studies in Tucson. But he said, you've 
got to listen to the people and you've got to put

12:21.438 --> 12:28.246
their ideas into the plan. He said, if you don't, 
They don't buy. It's not theirs. And this is what

12:34.113 --> 12:35.595
Hal would do. It was what the city manager, Howard 
McMahon, said, well, take care of that. Just put

12:41.583 --> 12:42.485
those in. I said, don't do that just at the flipping 
of a switch. It takes time to resolve these

12:46.971 --> 12:53.660
conflicting issues and points of view and ideas. 
So finally, it just got to the point where we were in

12:53.680 --> 12:59.288
a real impasse. And Howard and I had a real set to. 
And I said, Howard, you're the city manager. You

13:05.739 --> 13:07.241
run it the way you want to. But I tell you right now, 
development of a sector plan, of sector plans and a

13:08.041 --> 13:29.342
program for the city of Fort Worth is probably 
going to take, realistically, within the

13:08.041 --> 13:29.342
manpower allocations that you have permitted us 
to have set up, probably going to take six to seven

13:08.041 --> 13:29.342
years. And he said, it's got to be done in half that 
time at the outside. And I said, well, I'm telling

13:36.571 --> 13:38.153
you. Here's my resignation. And I went into 
private practice at that point. And that was in

13:43.598 --> 13:44.799
1969. Interestingly enough, it was within about 
two months of the seven years that the last of the

13:44.940 --> 14:00.055
sector plan studies had been processed, gone 
through the community, and were adopted by the

14:00.963 --> 14:08.472
City Planning Commission from the date we 
started. So I felt very satisfied that my time

14:10.514 --> 14:13.918
estimates were right. And this was in spite of the 
fact that Howard then pumped about another

14:14.799 --> 14:28.454
$50,000 to $80,000 a year, successively each 
year, that much more, into the Long Range Planning

14:14.799 --> 14:28.454
Program in Fort Worth. But it still took that. kind 
of time, not because of the lack of technical

14:30.646 --> 14:34.530
support. It was the time required for citizens to 
digest material and make up their minds and ask

14:34.550 --> 14:47.866
questions and resolve issues and come back and 
say, this is what we want. For any plan of this

14:47.886 --> 14:52.311
nature, it's about a year gestation time. Sure. 
And see, what we were doing was starting a new, we

14:53.673 --> 15:00.180
programmed it to start a new sector study every 
four to six months.

15:04.899 --> 15:20.460
And my successor, David Farrington, who was 
really an engineer who didn't understand a lot of

15:04.899 --> 15:20.460
things about the planning process, and then he 
kind of left him because he saw greener pastures

15:04.899 --> 15:20.460
elsewhere. Then George Human, who was assistant 
city manager, took over. And George was the one who

15:26.828 --> 15:30.032
was kind enough to send me a copy of the newspaper 
notice that said that the sector planning program

15:30.299 --> 15:35.828
has now come full circle. George is a nice guy. Oh, 
yeah, he is. He really is. He had more

15:40.415 --> 15:47.867
understanding of the nature of the planning 
process than... Farrington. Farrington.

15:48.388 --> 15:48.868
Farrington. All he saw was the engineering 
considerations. Do you know when George took over

15:52.754 --> 15:56.520
as planning director in Fort Worth? Wasn't that 
about 19... 71 or so? It would have been close to

15:59.835 --> 16:01.798
that, yes. Late 70 or early 71. And then after 
George?

16:10.670 --> 16:16.377
I don't know who was in there then after that. My 
predecessor was William Jennings Bryan Baker and

16:17.639 --> 16:27.272
he had been there for five years and Bryan was not a 
He was a good talker, but I think he often found

16:28.180 --> 16:38.892
himself crosswise with the city council and other 
officials. But he lasted exactly five years to the

16:39.793 --> 16:42.737
day.

16:45.960 --> 16:56.112
By way of a flashback,

16:45.960 --> 16:56.112
reflecting on the Tucson situation, Andy Ford had 
come there under Laszlo Seiko. having previously

16:56.935 --> 17:06.304
worked under Segoe in New Jersey on some town 
planning assignments, and particularly in

16:56.935 --> 17:06.304
Montclair, New Jersey. And then really what I saw 
in Segoe's work in Tucson, which was for Tucson and

17:07.045 --> 17:26.183
Pima County, was a product that was imbued with a 
lot of caring about the community. at the same time

17:26.720 --> 17:42.897
with some very strong, strong recommendations 
about such things as thoroughfare, street

17:26.720 --> 17:42.897
standards, standards for protection of 
floodplain areas and things of that sort. In fact,

17:43.178 --> 17:49.204
Segal was in some respect way ahead of his day 
talking about flood hazards out in the desert.

17:49.324 --> 17:50.646
People just didn't believe him. They wouldn't 
listen to him at that time. And Andy... for was very

17:56.690 --> 18:10.549
much of a person who would bring up a topic that 
Segoe had identified. And he would say, no, wait a

18:10.730 --> 18:13.253
minute. Let's look at this. He'd say this in the 
middle of a planning commission meeting. And a

18:19.342 --> 18:25.971
very illustrative example of something occurred 
one time in Tucson, a subdivider was had been told

18:26.272 --> 18:40.090
in the review of the subdivision plan, or the 
preliminary plan, you must provide your half of

18:26.272 --> 18:40.090
this 150-foot right-of-way or 160-foot 
right-of-way along this major street. And I don't

18:40.110 --> 18:41.692
remember what road it was. It's not important. Do 
you want all this? Yeah. The point is that the man

18:43.754 --> 18:55.249
protested to the city council and said the city has 
never adopted that comprehensive plan. The city

18:56.933 --> 19:03.100
has never adopted the third streets and highways 
plan.

19:03.120 --> 19:07.465
The issue, the council, of course, was on 
tenterhooks. What do we do? They turned it over to

19:08.686 --> 19:15.173
the city attorney, and the city attorney came 
right back and said, you don't have to have adopted

19:08.686 --> 19:15.173
that. Your planning commission has been 
observing it. You have been ratifying it with

19:18.477 --> 19:23.903
every subdivision plat that you've approved in 
accordance with state law. You have insisted that

19:25.250 --> 19:35.483
every developer along the way adhere to the 
standards that are enunciated in that plan, and

19:25.250 --> 19:35.483
that plan has been well known in the community for 
six, seven, eight years. You are on perfectly

19:37.845 --> 19:39.808
solid ground. The man took the issue to court, and 
the court sustained the position of the city

19:41.029 --> 19:47.317
attorney. They said, in fact, the city council had 
adopted the plan because over and over, in their

19:47.698 --> 19:53.805
actions, they had referred to the plan as their 
official guide. Sort of like a common law

19:58.248 --> 19:59.891
marriage. That's right, very much so. And I think I 
gained a lot of respect for Andy Ford at that point

20:02.454 --> 20:18.675
because he saw this as a bond, if you will, between 
reflected in community policy between the

20:02.454 --> 20:18.675
official actions on the one hand and the advisory 
actions on the other. And one other thing that Andy

20:19.917 --> 20:23.742
did do, which I appreciated very much, He taught me 
very well how to do minutes of meetings. And he had a

20:28.494 --> 20:36.822
little trick that he used that came out of his 
experience in New England town meetings when he

20:28.494 --> 20:36.822
lived up in New England. Because the New England 
town meeting sometimes gets to be kind of

20:37.322 --> 20:44.449
disjointed. He said there were three actions that 
you could report, either how something was voted,

20:45.490 --> 20:53.357
how it was agreed upon, or what the consensus was. 
And he said, those are the three key words that you

20:55.424 --> 20:59.589
put in your minutes. And he said, once the minutes 
are ratified by the body at the next meeting or

20:59.610 --> 21:10.044
whenever, that's just as good as any binding 
formal vote. And I have lived by that over the years

21:10.064 --> 21:12.087
since. And when I went to Austin, we developed the 
minutes so that it was reflected such and such was

21:12.147 --> 21:21.741
voted to recommend or to approve or whatever and if 
it was simply an agreement it was agreed colon that

21:22.430 --> 21:51.576
so and so or if it was a situation where there wasn't 
any apparent agreement it appeared to be the

21:22.430 --> 21:51.576
consensus colon that so and so would be done and 
that resolved the matter and uh i talked with city

21:22.430 --> 21:51.576
attorneys various times uh when i show them this 
and boy they were just tickled to death they said

21:22.430 --> 21:51.576
these have been adopted i said yes I said, okay, 
that's all we need to know. So Andy Ford, because of

21:56.907 --> 22:06.021
experience under CEDAW, really carried down a lot 
of things for me.

22:07.783 --> 22:11.449
I was involved in a couple of things while I was in 
Fort Worth. One was a very active role in setting up

22:11.609 --> 22:19.521
the North Central Texas Council of Governments as 
a staff person. There were several of us from

22:20.243 --> 22:25.509
Dallas and Fort Worth and some of the other cities 
that took an active role in that. And I was really

22:25.549 --> 22:36.340
the one responsible to the city manager for the 
city of Fort Worth's part in the background work

22:25.549 --> 22:36.340
leading up to COG being established.

22:38.863 --> 22:48.613
I was also involved uniquely because of the 
research interests that I had in the effort to get

22:49.201 --> 22:51.644
the School of Social Work established at UT 
Arlington. And I was also involved in

22:53.147 --> 23:09.390
establishing, in a way, the planning program at 
the School of Architecture at UT

22:53.147 --> 23:09.390
Arlington. Particularly in heading the 
committee that Bob Wagner referred to, trying to

23:09.770 --> 23:18.583
come up with some basic criteria for 
incorporation into the curriculum. That was with

23:22.021 --> 23:23.483
Bill Shevlin. That's right. Bill was on that, and 
frankly, I don't remember who all the other people

23:24.024 --> 23:28.250
were. There were quite a few of us that were 
involved. Bob was involved. Bob Wagner was

23:33.298 --> 23:34.660
involved in that. Shevlin was involved. I was.

23:40.109 --> 23:45.297
Springer provided some background in that.

23:46.711 --> 23:52.556
I don't remember who the others were, but there 
were half a dozen people that were involved in one

23:46.711 --> 23:52.556
fashion or other. And it was finally up to me to 
develop the final recommendations as they went

23:52.576 --> 23:59.283
into UT. So I felt, in a lot of ways, my 
contributions sort of hit a number of areas. The

24:06.750 --> 24:14.777
social work area and research area, I'd been 
involved at TCU in the urban studies program.

24:15.162 --> 24:23.532
teaching there in the planning courses, and then 
at SMU teaching in the planning courses through

24:15.162 --> 24:23.532
real estate and regional science. How do you view 
the current state of planning in Texas today?

24:34.005 --> 24:43.617
Frankly, I'm not as happy with the situation or as 
comfortable with it as I would like to be.

24:44.828 --> 25:00.705
On the one hand, Bob, I see the planning not being 
allowed to really move out and deal with issues as

24:44.828 --> 25:00.705
they need to be dealt with. I see some of these 
neighborhood problems here in Dallas, for

25:00.825 --> 25:14.599
example, where, of course, Dallas has a history of 
let the developer control the situation. I don't

25:14.815 --> 25:31.871
read in the newspaper the identification of the 
planning function as being intimately involved

25:14.815 --> 25:31.871
with the concerns of what happens in the 
neighborhood. That's not a fair assessment

25:32.231 --> 25:37.997
because I know they are, or at least I think they 
are. But on the other hand, I don't find that the

25:38.537 --> 25:44.603
newspapers are identifying the planning 
function as one that is in the middle of trying to

25:45.258 --> 25:58.317
help deal with the critical issues. It's the 
neighborhood group versus the developer instead

25:58.337 --> 26:07.651
of where's the planner in all of this, other than 
the private planner for the developer. It sounds

26:07.671 --> 26:09.674
like we don't have much PR. That's one of the 
problems, certainly. The other, though, I guess

26:14.840 --> 26:17.402
I'm still suspicious. I say suspicious. That may 
not be the best word. But I still have some negative

26:20.265 --> 26:27.492
feelings about the way planning functions in a 
council manager city. Not that it's remote from

26:29.994 --> 26:44.188
the manager, but that the manager is pressed so 
hard, as is all corporate business in America, to

26:29.994 --> 26:44.188
worry about this next quarter's bottom line 
report or next mid-year report or next year's

26:44.708 --> 27:13.686
report on bottom line that the manager and his 
staff or her staff are constantly driven by the

26:44.708 --> 27:13.686
dollar signs on the budget and not driven by issues 
that are concerned with the dollar signs five

27:14.645 --> 27:17.689
years and ten years from now. A case of 
incompatible time horizons. Oh, very much so.

27:23.818 --> 27:25.600
Very much so. The planner, by nature, is not 
looking at this quarterly report. I mean, even a

27:31.488 --> 27:36.535
subdivision approval is not looking at that 
quarterly report. Oh, no, it's very long range. A

27:38.818 --> 27:41.822
zoning change is not looking at the quarterly 
report. At best, it's looking at six months or...

27:44.142 --> 27:45.604
nine months or a year from now. So I think this is the 
one shortcoming. The other is that managers

27:51.851 --> 28:07.889
themselves, as I see it, have not been schooled in 
the philosophy of long-range planning for their

27:51.851 --> 28:07.889
communities. And they seem to be reflecting 
instead at least on the operational side, the

28:13.927 --> 28:21.978
attitudes of the Harvard Graduate School of 
Business. We are a large corporate structure. Run

28:25.643 --> 28:26.524
it like a business. Run it like a business, yeah. 
And don't bother the people at top with the

28:28.547 --> 28:35.637
problems of the people in the community at large. 
After all, they're the taxpayers, but our job is to

28:35.717 --> 28:43.528
do the best professional job we can to run the city 
not provide the best community for them. Do you

28:48.201 --> 28:56.933
think the role of state government in Texas with 
regard to planning has been adequate? No, quite

28:56.953 --> 29:00.217
frankly. The brightest star on the horizon is the 
formation, or was the formation, and still

29:02.660 --> 29:12.233
remains, the councils of government.

29:13.175 --> 29:14.837
I don't... However, the quality of that varies 
across the state. Within our own area... You've

29:17.761 --> 29:20.545
done quite well. North Central Texas' cog, which 
was the first one in the state, has really done a

29:20.585 --> 29:26.693
beautiful job. I cannot fault conceptually what 
they have been able to do. I'm not sure that I agree

29:32.862 --> 29:38.830
with Bill Pitstick, whom incidentally I shared 
classes with at UT Austin one time. But I... Bill's

29:42.554 --> 29:52.767
style is again somewhat related to the council 
manager's style in the way he runs things. But

29:52.787 --> 30:10.570
because COGs are what they are structurally in 
terms of governmental relationships, the

29:52.787 --> 30:10.570
governmental respondents or participants, a 
mayor, a councilman, a regional representative,

29:52.787 --> 30:10.570
they are really responsible to for the whole 
entity and they're responsible in a sense to each

30:11.326 --> 30:16.954
other as well as their own personal constituency. 
That puts the COGS in a different working

30:17.875 --> 30:27.309
relationship than does a city council under a 
council manager plan. But what about the state

30:27.329 --> 30:32.656
government itself rather than COGS?

30:33.497 --> 30:40.287
What about the role of the state legislature 
vis-a-vis planning legislation, for example?

30:42.241 --> 30:47.386
I don't see much positive support. And I may be very 
negative about this. I don't see much positive

30:49.988 --> 30:54.593
support coming out of the legislature for 
planning. I think as a state, we are still, well,

30:54.673 --> 31:06.204
we're not quite in the wild west, but we're not from 
that strong individualism. Don't bother the man.

31:09.545 --> 31:16.831
or the woman who's trying to do something to pull 
himself or herself up our own bootstraps. Don't

31:16.851 --> 31:18.833
bug anybody.

31:24.338 --> 31:30.002
Let me ask you next what your views are on planning 
education in Texas. Bob, I guess there's several

31:31.664 --> 31:36.468
things that ought to be said. One is I did. do part of 
my graduate work in the planning program.
