WEBVTT

00:01.162 --> 00:08.330
Office of Debbie Messing Hamlin, and this is the 
15th of March, 1985. And we're here to discuss with

00:09.031 --> 00:15.979
Debbie her role in the department. So, Debbie, let 
me just double. Okay, I'm the Community

00:18.282 --> 00:26.772
Development Administrator for the city, and I've 
been with the city about 10 years, and I have a

00:18.282 --> 00:26.772
master's in planning. I started out with the 
planning department 10 years ago, And I did

00:30.170 --> 00:35.616
general planning for about three or four years 
under Mr. Cunningham. And then when

00:35.636 --> 00:43.165
grants were introduced to the city, I transferred 
laterally. And I've been working with community

00:43.225 --> 00:54.979
development block grants ever since, including 
EDAG grants, economic development grants,

00:43.225 --> 00:54.979
whatever kind of grant programs that we happen to 
administer.

00:55.972 --> 01:00.797
Okay, Debbie, I've been talking with Nestor, and 
he's answered some of these questions already.

01:01.398 --> 01:09.948
But I wanted to ask you what the role of private 
planning consultants has been in El Paso's

01:01.398 --> 01:09.948
development. Okay. We've retained two major 
consultants in the last few years. For our

01:15.474 --> 01:23.903
downtown plan, we've retained American Cities 
Corporation, which is a subsidiary of the Rouse

01:15.474 --> 01:23.903
Corporation. They came in and prepared a downtown 
implementation plan for the city. And with that

01:29.588 --> 01:38.178
plan, we were able to generate a UDAG for our 
downtown. And that included a $6 million UDAG for

01:39.399 --> 01:48.670
the revitalization and restoration of two major 
buildings. One will be a downtown hotel, the other

01:48.790 --> 01:52.354
a major office building. Both of them are National 
Register properties, and they generate about $40

01:52.857 --> 01:58.786
million worth of private sector money. And that's 
the first major... What's the name of the hotel?

02:03.553 --> 02:07.358
The Paso Del Norte Hotel and the Cortez Office 
Building. We remember the Paso Del Norte Hotel

02:07.378 --> 02:19.877
because we had you arranged, essentially, the AIP 
conference there for the Texas chapter in 19...

02:07.378 --> 02:19.877
Oh, gosh, it's been about 1979. 79, was it? Or 78, 
something like that. And that one will be totally

02:22.945 --> 02:27.830
restored. And right next to it will be constructed 
a 20-story tower, which will be designed in the old

02:27.850 --> 02:37.521
style to complement the Paso Morning Hotel. And 
then the Cortez office building, which is also a

02:37.541 --> 02:47.492
Trost National Register property, will be 
restored into office and parking garage. That is

02:49.714 --> 02:51.636
essentially the first major development, 
public-private partnership downtown, and we're

02:52.055 --> 03:00.568
hoping it'll spur on more development downtown. 
We also have retained Zuckelly Hunter, which is

03:02.151 --> 03:14.991
Z-U-C-H-E-L-L-I, Hunter Consultants, to 
prepare a downtown revitalization project. plan

03:15.308 --> 03:22.016
and program for implementation in downtown 
Isleta, which is in our lower valley. That's an

03:22.056 --> 03:39.578
area that was incorporated into the city about 50 
or 60 years ago and has some of the oldest missions

03:22.056 --> 03:39.578
and some of our oldest history in El Paso, the Tegua 
Indians and so on. We also retain the housing, the

03:40.891 --> 03:59.811
Historical American Buildings Survey crew out of 
Washington a couple of years ago did a mission

03:40.891 --> 03:59.811
trail study which goes down into our valley and 
some of the information that the killing hunters

03:40.891 --> 03:59.811
use, they'll be using from the Habs people. Where 
is the Sukelle 100 firm located? I keep wanting to

04:04.842 --> 04:10.108
think they're out of Boston, but I think they're 
also out of somewhere around Maryland. They're

04:10.128 --> 04:11.189
out of the East Coast. East Coast. In both cases, 
the city looked around and did a request for

04:13.291 --> 04:29.629
proposals to research which firms would be the 
best suited for El Paso, and we're hoping that

04:13.291 --> 04:29.629
we'll be able to implement some of their 
recommendations out of both studies. We since, I

04:29.609 --> 04:38.721
should say, retained American Cities again since 
the downtown master plan to do a remarketing study

04:29.609 --> 04:38.721
for downtown El Paso. We've been hurt very badly by 
the Paso devaluation and our retailers are asking

04:40.424 --> 04:54.823
that they be helped to understand what the market 
really is now and to possibly remarket their their

04:55.900 --> 05:00.104
businesses for better retail. So we're working 
with them to do that. We're also waiting for Ralph

05:02.627 --> 05:06.291
to come to El Paso in March. Oh, this March, this 
month. There will be a public announcement after

05:09.954 --> 05:22.167
that as to whether or not Ralph will be committing 
to El Paso further to possibly bring a large retail

05:09.954 --> 05:22.167
component to our district. We'll see what happens 
there. And then you mentioned the planning

05:24.082 --> 05:27.847
department has... Yes. We have funded, the 
community development program has funded

05:29.249 --> 05:37.821
$50,000 to the planning department to update 
their comprehensive plan. And I believe that the

05:39.282 --> 05:42.547
city is also matching that share. And hopefully 
they'll be retaining a consultant. I don't

05:45.431 --> 05:49.917
believe they have any, but they'll be retaining a 
consultant to do an update. Okay. Going on to the

05:51.487 --> 06:04.884
next question, about the five or so major events 
that have affected El Paso's planning and the

05:51.487 --> 06:04.884
development of El Paso.

06:09.410 --> 06:15.418
I think the Chamizal Treaty was a major 
development in El Paso, rerouting the river and

06:15.888 --> 06:21.979
causing changes to the land use and development to 
El Paso space. And that's been 15 years, I guess, or

06:22.520 --> 06:27.069
20. That's C-H-A-M-I-Z-A-L treaty. Mr. 
Cunningham was the major force in that treaty.

06:39.648 --> 06:45.195
Like I said, it did reroute the river through El 
Paso. I understand most of the land had to be given

06:45.275 --> 06:49.181
to Mexico. Yes, a lot of it did. There was a lot of 
relocation of homes also. That was during

06:56.731 --> 06:59.935
President Johnson's administration? Yeah, 
President. He came to El Paso during that time. Oh,

07:04.861 --> 07:08.325
he did visit El Paso as president. Yeah, so did 
Kennedy right during that. It was right during the

07:10.248 --> 07:11.930
Kennedy-Johnson. Uh-huh. And they created a 
monument for Kennedy over there. They think he's

07:16.816 --> 07:18.778
quite impressive. I see. They equated him sort of 
to Lincoln, so they have,

07:19.679 --> 07:29.972
I guess they, yeah, they did have two presidents. 
Two special movements between them at the same

07:30.509 --> 07:35.170
time. Another big, I guess, I think change has been 
the takeover of the more national banks over our

07:36.601 --> 07:49.898
local banking industry here in El Paso. And that 
probably was looked upon originally as a negative

07:50.438 --> 07:58.328
takeover because people like to keep their things 
home. But I think it will be a good injection into

07:58.949 --> 08:04.296
the El Paso economy. very concerned about the 
downtown. They want to see it prosper. And they

08:08.505 --> 08:14.522
seem to be interested in working with private and 
public parties to try and inject money into El Paso

08:15.093 --> 08:19.539
for that purpose. I think another big change has 
been the development of the north-south and

08:22.002 --> 08:37.743
east-west freeways in El Paso and they have 
spurred development in both directions and the

08:22.002 --> 08:37.743
land use has definitely changed along both those 
routes. There was a major amount of course of

08:38.764 --> 08:45.032
relocation to perform both of those

08:45.890 --> 08:56.031
developments, but they have changed, like I say, 
especially in the eastern part of El Paso where it

08:45.890 --> 08:56.031
was all desert and there was really no way to get 
downtown to the west side. Um, way past Fort Bliss

08:57.193 --> 09:02.444
and out toward, um, I guess that's I-10. Um, and 
then I think, What was the other thing you were

09:07.844 --> 09:09.266
talking about? Fort Bliss. Fort Bliss, right. 
Fort Bliss used to be a major base in El Paso, and

09:11.029 --> 09:15.776
then they cut way down. They didn't have their 
basic training here anymore, and it really hurt

09:15.836 --> 09:19.401
our economy. It appears now that the government's 
decided to go ahead and reenact that basic

09:19.541 --> 09:33.201
training element and also train a lot of foreign 
military here in El Paso. So that will be a big

09:33.221 --> 09:35.725
injection of the economy. OK. Anything else? One 
thing I need to mention, and you probably will

09:37.806 --> 09:48.330
share this a little bit more, is the development of 
our mountain, which has been a major impact on El

09:37.806 --> 09:48.330
Paso space. We've had a lot of controversy about 
how to develop it and the city has been looking into

09:48.614 --> 10:02.232
a lot of other cities as to how they develop their 
mountain areas and there's been a lot of scarring

09:48.614 --> 10:02.232
of the mountain because there wasn't good 
planning in the beginning. There's been a lot of

10:02.792 --> 10:08.800
anxiety to the, you know, to El Paso's El Paso has a 
lot of pride in the mountain. We'd like to keep it as

10:11.549 --> 10:13.993
it is. Of course, it's in the hands of private 
ownership, so we have developed a new mountain

10:14.053 --> 10:22.907
development ordinance and so on to try and 
regulate it as best we can. We're trying to do that

10:23.908 --> 10:25.791
now. Where is the wilderness area? The wilderness 
park, you can see it from here. It's actually the

10:31.299 --> 10:33.623
Franklin Mountains. This is the western side. As 
we look from City Hall to the mountain, the

10:36.300 --> 10:42.654
Wilderness Park area is really on the eastern side 
of the mountain. And it was an estate swap,

10:42.674 --> 10:48.186
basically, for that land to become Wilderness 
Park. Part of that mountain is now hidden in the

10:48.200 --> 10:53.385
clouds, but that wilderness park is at the very 
top.

10:56.188 --> 11:07.118
Some 200, I don't remember how many acres of that 
there is, but probably Nestor could tell

10:56.188 --> 11:07.118
you that. When you think a minute about events 
caused by governments and so forth at the national

11:07.739 --> 11:17.228
level or the state government, or Mexico in your 
case, what events have influenced planning in El

11:17.765 --> 11:27.801
Paso, if any?

11:34.332 --> 11:43.587
One event that has been a major implication is 
really the discussion of water and how it's going

11:34.332 --> 11:43.587
to affect El Paso's future. And I think the state of 
New Mexico and the state of Texas have been in

11:44.140 --> 11:56.198
litigation for some time now about the usage of 
their bolsons and so on for El Paso's water. And

11:56.358 --> 12:03.349
some of the latest litigation has ended in El 
Paso's favor, but it's being contested. And this

12:03.369 --> 12:09.338
time, you know, we're very concerned because 
water is... is supposedly going to be depleted in

12:09.841 --> 12:14.187
the next 30 or 40 years here. And that will 
definitely impact on El Paso's future

12:14.247 --> 12:18.393
development. So that has been one big state type of 
involvement we've been involved in the last two

12:19.094 --> 12:29.188
years in a major way. As far as Mexico goes, the peso 
devaluation has impacted us tremendously.

12:34.716 --> 12:36.338
Negatively, it has. both from the retail market 
that I described earlier and also in the fact that

12:36.318 --> 12:53.852
it's put a lot more people into El Paso, probably 
illegally and legally, trying to get to the United

12:36.318 --> 12:53.852
States to work because they've been hurt 
tremendously over there. I've heard that to work

12:55.075 --> 12:56.858
in their... industry for one week, they may get $3 
of American money. So they're coming over here in

13:01.512 --> 13:08.159
droves trying to find employment, which is 
impacting our own employment, which is extremely

13:01.512 --> 13:08.159
high, let's say 11%. We can't get our own people 
jobs, and we've got a lot of people from Mexico

13:10.001 --> 13:16.147
coming over here seeking employment also. That's 
neat. What administrative procedures and

13:18.869 --> 13:26.777
planning program elements does El Paso have for 
implementing community plans?

13:29.963 --> 13:35.672
Can you sort of give me some... For example, you 
have a separate department now here. That

13:36.353 --> 13:42.141
certainly is an administrative procedure that is 
different from most communities. Is it? I

13:42.902 --> 13:43.643
wasn't... I don't know how... Yeah, I guess it is 
different. Basically, yeah, we're a separate

13:48.210 --> 13:52.697
department.

13:53.690 --> 13:56.835
We try and tie in, of course, with planning as much 
as we can. They perform the long-range planning.

13:59.719 --> 14:03.605
We perform the short-range annual planning, 
pretty much. We are not involved at all in the

14:03.865 --> 14:09.093
subdivision and land use aspect. Strictly, we're 
looking at redevelopment of our older areas and to

14:09.213 --> 14:17.605
make them more viable neighborhoods.

14:19.576 --> 14:36.270
We're also involved in the economic development 
end of it, in that we have several economic

14:19.576 --> 14:36.270
development revolving loan funds here, which 
we're trying to provide the gap financing to small

14:19.576 --> 14:36.270
businesses that need financing that they can't 
get from the banks. And as we see, one of our main

14:36.290 --> 14:44.937
functions here and our goals is to try and increase 
the employment aspect. So we're working toward

14:45.218 --> 14:49.161
that. How many professional planners does El Paso 
have employed as part of city staff? That is to say,

14:57.582 --> 15:01.935
planners with planning degrees and so forth. In 
this department, I'm the only one.

15:07.866 --> 15:12.153
We have about 35 people employed here. And I was 
like an offshoot from planning department, so I'm

15:12.313 --> 15:16.980
just an implant. The planning department, let's 
see, I think they probably have, with planning

15:18.222 --> 15:29.538
degrees or related urban study degrees, maybe 
they have five or six. That's all. What future

15:33.050 --> 15:40.621
direction do you see El Paso's planning efforts 
taking in the next 10 years?

15:45.749 --> 16:02.213
I think we're all hoping that we can do more 
redevelopment of our inner city, and we're also

15:45.749 --> 16:02.213
hoping that we can maybe do more infill 
development in our older areas, rather than

15:45.749 --> 16:02.213
continuing to do the sprawl, which is where we've 
been headed. El Paso has grown tremendously fast

16:02.767 --> 16:07.474
in the last 20 years. I mean, I talked to our traffic 
engineer two days ago about traffic problems, and

16:07.614 --> 16:16.367
he related something to me that's kind of 
interesting. We were talking about the need to

16:18.030 --> 16:25.040
create Loop 72, 372 around the city because we have 
some traffic problems. I said, well, what kind of

16:25.521 --> 16:27.403
traffic problems do we have? He goes, well, for 
instance, in 1962 on Montana Street, We had like

16:32.146 --> 16:34.689
82,000 cars, and now we have 210,000. So, I mean, we 
have a tremendous amount of growth that's

16:35.310 --> 16:42.100
occurred in El Paso in a short time. I believe it's 
because we're a Sunbelt city. On the other hand, we

16:44.423 --> 16:55.318
haven't been able to get a handle on our pollution 
problems, and we haven't been able to get a handle

16:44.423 --> 16:55.318
on our growth problems, which are seeming to 
spread in all directions. So I think we're

16:55.658 --> 17:00.685
probably going to be hoping to...

17:02.504 --> 17:14.878
do more and better planning in our own inner city 
area and get a handle on all the illegal

17:02.504 --> 17:14.878
subdivision growth going on on the outside, more 
control, subdivision and zoning. Does the

17:14.898 --> 17:19.142
Planning Commission support staff in these 
matters? They have been pretty supportive, I

17:20.464 --> 17:22.206
think. And the council? The council, yeah. I think 
the council has been. We have a very strong mayor

17:26.710 --> 17:31.836
right now that is from the land development 
community. He is one of the major property owners

17:32.187 --> 17:35.732
in the city. He was also the president until last 
year of one of the largest mortgage-making

17:36.153 --> 17:42.502
industries in El Paso. And his name? Jonathan 
Rogers. So he has been a very pro-development but

17:45.326 --> 17:53.238
good development man, and I think it's been good 
for El Paso. What was the name of the mayor that

17:53.258 --> 17:56.743
Jonathan Cunningham worked so closely with? He 
was in office for so many mayors. I guess John

18:01.276 --> 18:05.502
Henderson, Fred Hervey. Fred Hervey was the mayor 
twice when he was in office. And he paved the first

18:09.808 --> 18:12.031
streets. I mean, I think probably it would be Fred 
Hervey. And he was very active in the development.

18:18.039 --> 18:24.047
And he still is a major mover in the development 
community.

18:31.587 --> 18:34.592
El Paso has a strong mayor form of government. That 
sometimes is very difficult for the planning

18:36.715 --> 18:43.527
function of local government to work with. Are 
there any moves toward city managers for El Paso or

18:44.729 --> 18:55.266
not, and how do you think that might eventually 
work itself out? I think in the last year, the city

18:55.364 --> 19:05.702
just created a new position under the mayor called 
the Executive Administrator or Assistant. And

19:06.543 --> 19:09.308
that is right now filled by Dr. Kenneth Beasley. 
Where does he come from? He comes from the

19:11.832 --> 19:14.216
university system. And the mayor brought him in 
when he was elected, Mayor Rogers did. And he has

19:18.668 --> 19:24.857
created that very strong position in salaries in 
the $60,000 range. And that is the first time we've

19:24.897 --> 19:29.944
ever had a funded position of that kind. And he acts 
sort of like a city manager, but he is not called a

19:29.964 --> 19:35.371
city manager. And I think he doesn't really have 
exactly the powers of a city manager. I don't think

19:39.577 --> 19:50.476
El Paso will move in that direction only because 
we've seen cities around El Paso like Las Cruces

19:39.577 --> 19:50.476
that have gone through many city managers, and 
they're smaller. It's a much smaller city than El

19:50.997 --> 19:55.785
Paso, 40,000, 50,000 population. I think we've 
seen historically that cities that... have the

19:58.510 --> 20:08.942
nature of the population we have around, 
approaching half a million, I mean, yeah,

19:58.510 --> 20:08.942
500,000, half a million now, that they don't 
really work well in cities that big. And I'm not

20:09.443 --> 20:23.639
sure El Paso will move in that direction, 
although, like I say, we sort of, this is the first,

20:09.443 --> 20:23.639
this is now, we're moving into our second or third 
year with this particular kind of individual in

20:09.443 --> 20:23.639
that position, and it has worked pretty well. He 
is... The mayor has relied on him heavily to make

20:26.000 --> 20:35.393
administrative decisions and has told the 
department heads that they are to go to him and

20:26.000 --> 20:35.393
solve all their problems before they ever get to 
him. So he's sort of acted in that capacity, but has

20:35.433 --> 20:42.763
not really called that or have the same sort of 
powers as the city manager has. Does he have

20:42.843 --> 20:44.745
authority over personnel?

20:47.349 --> 20:48.270
Yes and no. He works extremely close with the 
personnel department and the personnel

20:49.371 --> 20:54.358
director. He has helped to shape the change of the 
new city charter. So there has been some

20:59.252 --> 21:03.622
influence, yet I'm not real sure the nature. How 
strong is a city manager tied to that? Do you know,

21:07.971 --> 21:09.273
Bob? Usually the city manager is in charge of all 
personnel. Okay, he, no, he doesn't. With the

21:14.760 --> 21:16.622
exception of the city attorney. Okay, the city 
personnel director here is still very strong and

21:16.823 --> 21:22.350
runs the city personnel department. But like I 
said, this individual does work very strongly

21:22.370 --> 21:26.875
with you. So there is some similarity there, but 
not clear-cut. And I don't think that when the new

21:30.820 --> 21:40.793
city charter changes just were passed by the 
overall city last year, they did not incorporate

21:30.820 --> 21:40.793
that change into it. the city charter, so I don't 
know if we're going to be going in that direction

21:40.773 --> 21:45.840
anymore. I sort of doubt it. El Paso has quite a long 
history of comprehensive city-wide planning. Do

21:55.472 --> 21:56.594
you see that changing?

21:59.818 --> 22:00.139
I do. I do. I think that the city is really moving 
toward more of an implementation planning. I

22:07.548 --> 22:10.392
mean, I think that the long-range plan is 
important. But I think we're seeing that it can't

22:10.709 --> 22:13.433
be that long range. The time frame is going to have 
to be reduced. I think it probably will have to be

22:17.600 --> 22:19.703
reduced. That's my opinion. I think that when we 
look at what is realistic now and what we really

22:22.167 --> 22:35.529
need to shoot for, I think the longer range plans 
are becoming that effective or haven't been that

22:22.167 --> 22:35.529
effective in the past. So I would see a move away 
from that. Has the policies of the Reagan

22:39.245 --> 22:47.787
administration, have they had any effect on El 
Paso's planning and development? I think if

22:47.986 --> 22:53.131
they're implemented the way he wants them, 
they'll have major disastrous effect on the city.

22:54.712 --> 23:09.506
For instance, in revenue sharing, El Paso, in the 
last few years, has used their revenue sharing

22:54.712 --> 23:09.506
monies, most of them for operational rather than 
capital improvements, 97%. So if they were to be

23:10.727 --> 23:17.453
cut, it would affect us disastrously in the 
operational. area of the city and how it runs.

23:21.666 --> 23:27.966
Another good example of how it would affect El 
Paso, if they cut CDBG money. out totally, which is

23:28.300 --> 23:31.004
not looked at. They're not looking at doing that. 
But for instance, if they did, we are right now

23:32.166 --> 23:38.316
representing half of the city's capital 
improvements budget. If it's $15 million, we're

23:39.017 --> 23:42.222
representing half of it right now. That would hurt 
us tremendously. They're not looking at doing

23:45.928 --> 23:47.330
that. They're looking at maybe a 10% or 20% cut. It 
would still affect a major effect. We have been

23:52.398 --> 24:03.570
increasing our taxes slowly in El Paso, but 
historically we have not been a big proponent of

23:52.398 --> 24:03.570
raising taxes substantially. We're a relatively 
very poor city. compared to most other Texas

24:08.075 --> 24:09.997
cities. For instance, in our own program here, we 
have many houses a year. We spend about $2 or $3

24:16.503 --> 24:18.965
million annually. We have homes of families that 
have less than $4,500 incomes. So we have not

24:24.390 --> 24:28.593
historically been a city that's raised taxes. So 
we may have to start looking at that or some

24:28.674 --> 24:38.082
alternative bond issues or something else to 
raise money to do capital improvements if

24:28.674 --> 24:38.082
Reagan's plans to cut us federally come through. 
So it will hurt us tremendously. Can you think of

24:47.555 --> 24:59.631
any additional thoughts that might affect El 
Paso's future in terms of the direction it takes in

24:47.555 --> 24:59.631
planning?

25:04.640 --> 25:17.537
This

25:04.640 --> 25:17.537
is the second part of the interview with Anne 
Cunningham. Anne,

25:18.919 --> 25:33.398
regarding the major individuals who instigated 
or strongly affected El Paso's planning

25:18.919 --> 25:33.398
programs, Could you recall some of these 
individuals and also indicate in what way they

25:33.850 --> 25:41.441
affected planning in El Paso? I do remember two 
outstanding chairmen of the City Planning

25:43.003 --> 26:02.912
Commission that served with John very well and 
contributed so much of their time and

25:43.003 --> 26:02.912
thoughtfulness and genuine unselfishness to the 
cause of city planning. The two men I remember

26:08.731 --> 26:37.320
distinctly are Mr. Herbert Swartz of the popular 
department store who gave up so much of his time and

26:08.731 --> 26:37.320
even some of his property to develop a downtown 
little park to beautify the city and served

26:08.731 --> 26:37.320
judiciously and well as a planning commissioner 
and director of the planning commission. Do you

26:37.773 --> 26:40.716
know what period that was? What years? I can't 
recall the years, but they could be researched.

26:50.324 --> 26:57.051
Another good gentleman who served with 
distinction was Mr. Leonard Goodman. He and

26:58.612 --> 27:05.198
Jonathan worked so well together and did 
accomplish so many fine decisions with the help of

27:06.022 --> 27:15.396
a good commission at the time. Two fine mayors that 
I recall. One, Judson Williams, a man that

27:21.084 --> 27:34.864
Jonathan felt was a fine administrator, willing 
to take responsibility, make decisions, and then

27:21.084 --> 27:34.864
put them into effect. He also enjoyed working with 
Burt Williams, who was a flamboyant and fun mayor,

27:36.768 --> 27:55.521
and yet a mayor with a great deal of courage, a mayor 
unlike any other mayor I believe in the United

27:36.768 --> 27:55.521
States had the courage to sue a circle for 
polluting the city.

27:58.546 --> 27:59.788
Remember Burt Williams? Yes, didn't he have his 
own airplane? I don't remember that. That would

28:04.425 --> 28:06.027
fly here and there? I don't think Burt had an 
airplane, to my knowledge, but he may have. One of

28:10.792 --> 28:13.815
the mayors had that John was very close to. Really? 
I'd forgotten that detail.

28:19.401 --> 28:23.305
Now, there were some good women on the planning 
commissions, too. I shouldn't overlook their

28:23.385 --> 28:25.067
names.

28:28.372 --> 28:31.956
And forgive me for not remembering them right now. 
Well, you can write them in later on when I send you

28:31.976 --> 28:36.541
the transcription. All right. OK. Think a minute 
of about the half dozen most important events that

28:42.827 --> 28:52.117
have occurred in El Paso in terms of planning. Just 
briefly enumerate them. Well, I think always of

28:55.979 --> 29:07.113
the Shamizal National Memorial Park as a cultural 
center for the city, funded and helped by the

28:55.979 --> 29:07.113
federal government. Then I think of the 
interstate freeway development system that

29:08.014 --> 29:24.855
Jonathan worked so diligently to get rooted 
properly through the city with the greatest

29:25.477 --> 29:52.935
amount of efficiency and beauty in other words he 
made an underpass under the city rather than put

29:25.477 --> 29:52.935
put the interstate up high on stilts over the city 
so that it would not detract from the city skyline

29:25.477 --> 29:52.935
and he was proud of that fact now the other planning 
events in El Paso. We've already mentioned the

29:56.821 --> 29:59.745
park system. And then you had some reference to the 
school. Oh, I think whenever the public schools,

30:02.748 --> 30:24.272
community college, and UT El Paso asked Jonathan 
for advice for site planning or site additions or

30:02.748 --> 30:24.272
genuine

30:02.748 --> 30:24.272
concerns about planning parking space or 
extending their genuine areas to be more

30:24.944 --> 30:32.350
serviceable to the community. Jonathan 
willingly studied these situations as carefully

30:33.011 --> 30:42.119
as he could and gave them good advice. In fact, many 
of the school locations, community college

30:42.880 --> 30:54.850
locations, were suggested by Jonathan and they 
have turned out to be useful and efficient. Would

30:57.323 --> 31:05.650
you care to recall the selection of the location 
for the Civic Center? That I do remember. John felt

31:09.834 --> 31:19.723
that it should be, of course, accessible 
primarily for people living in all sections of

31:09.834 --> 31:19.723
this city. And his site selection downtown easily 
entered by people from east, northeast, west El

31:24.766 --> 31:46.207
Paso via the interstate, is fine and has turned out 
to be the best possible location that a civic

31:24.766 --> 31:46.207
center could have for a city of our size. It was 
quite controversial before it was constructed.

31:50.892 --> 31:54.756
At the time, many did criticize the site. yet it was 
acquired

31:55.360 --> 32:19.126
within the economic bounds of the city's ability, 
and it also geographically,

31:55.360 --> 32:19.126
and from the point of view of accessibility, as I 
said before, was just fine, and it still is. The

32:20.547 --> 32:21.368
railroads. In the Kessler Plan, George Kessler, 
Noted in 1925, or actually it was before that, that

32:25.128 --> 32:40.468
the railroads had numerous grade crossings with 
downtown streets, and the plan called for their

32:25.128 --> 32:40.468
eventual removal. As I understand it, John moved 
as best he could to implement that proposal, the

32:41.509 --> 32:53.565
original proposal. plan for El Paso. Yes, he did 
feel that the railroads did detract from the

32:56.902 --> 33:14.561
downtown area and moved to have them put 
underground and wanted them not to obstruct the

32:56.902 --> 33:14.561
transportation within the city. I remember he had 
many, many meetings with the directors of the

33:14.641 --> 33:23.991
railroads that came into El Paso, too. see if grade 
crossings could be better for the use of the city

33:24.308 --> 33:38.549
residents, and at the same time not destroy the 
efficiency of the railroads.

33:42.454 --> 33:45.058
Okay.

33:46.540 --> 33:49.945
John was continually working for the good of his 
staff to get better quarters. And they moved from

33:50.752 --> 34:04.087
the old abandoned Safeway store on Ochoa Street to 
a new city hall where they weren't in a separate

33:50.752 --> 34:04.087
building, isolated from the rest of the official 
city family. Yet the Safeway building was really

34:04.708 --> 34:16.140
updated and made into a fine office building for 
his staff by Mr. Joe Hamra. It was one of the most

34:17.622 --> 34:20.185
efficient buildings beautifully planned, 
planning buildings I've ever seen. It was

34:27.434 --> 34:32.581
perfectly located. Are we in to this now? We're 
taping. It had a conference room. It had a small map

34:40.933 --> 34:45.880
room, perhaps not large enough. Good design 
quarters. Excellent reception desk. With Mrs.

34:51.910 --> 34:53.452
Mendez behind it. Miss Mendez. Miss Mendez. Who 
was his administrative assistant. A very

35:00.742 --> 35:05.709
efficient office manager, if ever there was one. 
So I understand. And a fine translator of Spanish,

35:07.432 --> 35:19.669
and a fine correspondent in Spanish when Jonathan 
had to communicate with officials in Mexico City,

35:20.020 --> 35:27.028
by the way, over the Chamizal transfer of land.

35:31.193 --> 35:47.412
The Civic Center, the Convention Center, the 
schools, the railroad, Chamizal, carrying out

35:31.193 --> 35:47.412
the recommendations of the 1925 plan, having it 
updated periodically.

35:53.528 --> 35:56.490
What about the mountain, Franklin Mountain? Oh, 
he did. He did really work hard to preserve, I

35:58.312 --> 36:10.262
believe, the mountain beauty of this area. 
Although there was much criticism from the

36:11.964 --> 36:17.128
current place residence uh jonathan held off the 
development of crazy cat mountain i believe so

36:17.530 --> 36:47.352
that his um delaying process at least kept that 
development from getting off the ground for a

36:17.530 --> 36:47.352
while but as he always pointed out the man who owns 
the land eventually will develop it uh with um

36:47.720 --> 36:52.284
enough determination in about the way he wants to 
develop it. And Crazy Cat Mountain is being

36:53.666 --> 37:11.242
developed now in accord with certain planning 
regulations, but it has had many opposing

36:53.666 --> 37:11.242
factions, especially in the current place. Now, 
the Wilderness Park and the Guadalupe's was an

37:11.322 --> 37:16.427
interest of John's too, When Lady Bird Johnson 
came to the area, he and some people from the

37:16.897 --> 37:28.187
Interior Department did spend a few days down 
there on the Wilderness Park. And he was intensely

37:28.667 --> 37:32.210
interested in Tom May's park, too, in the county. 
His interest in planning extended beyond just the

37:33.091 --> 37:38.656
mere boundaries of the city. And he did work with 
the county commissioners on some of their plans

37:38.696 --> 37:46.262
for park development. I would say, too, that one of 
his strengths was working with the district

37:47.744 --> 37:57.337
attorney's office in the city of El Paso. In fact, 
when he retired, the city attorney's office, who

37:57.357 --> 38:16.063
relied on Jonathan for planning and zoning law 
interpretations, the district attorney's

37:57.357 --> 38:16.063
office did give John a special award plaque for his 
service to them because of his knowledge and his

38:17.140 --> 38:46.759
willingness to share his knowledge of municipal 
law zoning law with them well john was very active

38:17.140 --> 38:46.759
in aip and was successful in pulling together 
several regional conferences as well as the texas

38:17.140 --> 38:46.759
chapter conference here several years ago, which 
was, as I recall, one of the most enjoyable chapter

38:47.228 --> 38:56.220
conferences within living memory. Yes, wasn't he 
president of the Southwest Planners Group? I

39:02.628 --> 39:03.369
think he was. I'm not quite sure. Yes, he was. And he 
got the New Mexico planners interested in the

39:06.073 --> 39:15.565
Southwestern Gulf Planning Group, too, because 
they didn't seem to have any tie to any

39:16.135 --> 39:27.288
professional regional group, and he felt they 
should be a part of the whole planning picture for

39:16.135 --> 39:27.288
the Southwest. Yes, he enjoyed all his many 
contacts with planning conferences throughout

39:28.149 --> 39:44.607
the Southwest and made every effort to go to New 
Orleans and to go to Atlanta and to go to

39:28.149 --> 39:44.607
Albuquerque College Station. College Station? 
Dallas. Whenever he could, get away. He went to

39:53.716 --> 40:13.362
American Institute of Planners meetings, 
American Association of Planning Officials, and

39:53.716 --> 40:13.362
I think to become a lifetime member of both 
organizations, as I recall.

40:13.595 --> 40:29.871
If you can think of anything more when the 
transcription of this reaches you, you can add

40:13.595 --> 40:29.871
that to it, or if there's something that you would 
prefer to have deleted, you can do that as well. So

40:30.772 --> 40:33.155
thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it, 
and APA appreciates it. I'm honored.

40:45.488 --> 40:46.089
Good morning. This is March 16th. We're at Ed 
Hamlin's house in El Paso. Ed worked for quite a few

40:53.977 --> 41:00.404
years for the planning department and is a native 
of El Paso. He has a unique perspective on planning

41:01.365 --> 41:06.170
in El Paso.

41:08.733 --> 41:13.858
The interviewer is Robert Cornish, as has been the 
case with Ann Cunningham, Nestor Valencia

41:14.294 --> 41:20.802
yesterday. Okay, Ed, let's proceed with the 
history of planning in El Paso. I won't ask you

41:29.314 --> 41:39.627
questions regarding dates of things and that sort 
of thing, but from your point of view, Why don't you

41:41.243 --> 42:00.146
first of all consider the first half dozen or so 
events that you feel were the most important in

41:41.243 --> 42:00.146
terms of planning in El Paso that might have 
impacted planning and might have changed the

41:41.243 --> 42:00.146
nature of planning in El Paso?

42:03.390 --> 42:10.238
I think we could first perhaps categorize some 
events that were important in the overall growth

42:03.390 --> 42:10.238
and development of the city. kind of its reasons 
for the economic livelihood and why it's here. And

42:14.696 --> 42:21.583
then sort through from that to some of the events 
that had true plans and evidence. Sounds good. The

42:23.085 --> 42:28.971
city itself, it has a

42:23.085 --> 42:28.971
human settlement area. It has a long history. Back 
in the days of the Spanish explorers, this was a

42:32.234 --> 42:39.702
highway route between Chihuahua and Santa Fe. It 
being approximately halfway between being

42:40.677 --> 42:53.215
located next to a river in an arable valley and 
having a reputation of being a year-round

42:40.677 --> 42:53.215
snow-free pass through the mountains has its 
name. The settlement grew up in this area. That

43:00.105 --> 43:04.751
would be the first reason there was a human 
settlement here at all. The growth of the American

43:07.375 --> 43:10.279
settlement was very limited until The railroads 
came in 1881. The second thing that began to spur

43:15.271 --> 43:35.608
up, the next most significant thing that began to 
spur the growth of the community here,

43:15.271 --> 43:35.608
particularly on the American side, was the 
Mexican Revolution that occurred during the

43:15.271 --> 43:35.608
early teens of the century that caused a 
tremendous flight of Mexican citizens who were on

43:15.271 --> 43:35.608
the wrong side of the

43:42.271 --> 43:54.343
This

43:42.271 --> 43:54.343
early growth, the latter part of the 19th and early 
part of the 20th century, had set much of the form of

43:42.271 --> 43:54.343
the central core of the city. It was during this 
period that the thinking of the white city, the

43:55.805 --> 44:06.996
early city planning movement, began to reach as 
far as El Paso. And typical of the kind of thinking

44:07.938 --> 44:12.124
which was prevalent at the time, there was a plan. 
There was a plan for all time that was prepared for

44:13.626 --> 44:23.479
the area by a consultant, William Kessler, a man of 
some notoriety within the profession.

44:27.204 --> 44:37.438
It's interesting in a sense to go back to that early 
plan and see many of the elements that continue to

44:27.204 --> 44:37.438
have relevance and meaning to the city in terms of 
its physical form that were included in that plan.

44:38.228 --> 44:49.340
The

44:38.228 --> 44:49.340
period which followed, particularly going into 
the Depression, was a period when the city's

44:38.228 --> 44:49.340
growth slowed down considerably. There was very 
little of any population growth during that

44:49.380 --> 44:53.424
period. El Paso at the time, say 1920, was the 
biggest city between Dallas and Los Angeles, or at

44:53.444 --> 45:02.194
least both to that. It watched its neighboring 
communities grow and prosper while they tended to

45:02.214 --> 45:08.100
stagnate.

45:09.970 --> 45:37.497
The thing that, the element that began to, again,

45:09.970 --> 45:37.497
causing a change in the economic dynamics of the 
city, I suppose, would be the advent of the use of

45:09.970 --> 45:37.497
Fort Bliss, a military fort here, for the 
aerospace research, particularly in the postwar

45:09.970 --> 45:37.497
period. that together with the military 
populations which are brought through here, some

45:37.983 --> 45:43.830
of which chose to later settle down in this area. 
The city has been since 1950 on a rather dynamic

45:45.271 --> 45:50.778
growth cycle. Going back to what elements within 
the growth would be significant from a planning

45:52.339 --> 46:07.737
perspective,

45:52.339 --> 46:07.737
early decisions that were made regarding the 
city's form, the early town maps and things like

45:52.339 --> 46:07.737
that were prepared, were done by surveys, as they 
would have been as they would have been. The

46:10.555 --> 46:30.174
pattern of the city, perhaps almost owing to its 
location in the southwestern region, there was a

46:10.555 --> 46:30.174
town square created almost as

46:10.555 --> 46:30.174
though it had been a Spanish colonial thinking of a 
town plaza with the governor's mansion around

46:10.555 --> 46:30.174
there. The city didn't have that heritage, but it 
picked up that form and element from from

46:36.505 --> 46:44.997
neighboring examples, particularly in the older 
communities that trace the Spanish heritage.

46:47.661 --> 46:50.785
So it wasn't directly modeled after the law of the 
Indies? No, it was not directly modeled after

46:50.805 --> 46:52.407
that.

46:55.732 --> 47:02.361
Incidentally, for whoever's trying to 
transcribe that, they're sandblasting my porch

46:55.732 --> 47:02.361
right now, and you may have some difficulty 
hearing me. That doesn't need to be printed. No.

47:07.015 --> 47:36.297
Some

47:07.015 --> 47:36.297
of the elements from the Kessler plan that became 
significant that set part of the form of the city,

47:07.015 --> 47:36.297
some of the parks that were envisioned in that 
plan, some of the thinking that accompanied that

47:07.015 --> 47:36.297
plan in terms of trying to bring about the identity 
of the community through some of its resources

47:07.015 --> 47:36.297
that would include taking advantage of the bluffs 
that offered spectators.
