ABC, ABC testing. This is April the 7th, 8th? April

00:39.433 --> 00:39.973
the 8th. April the 8th. We're over on Broadmoor, 
and I have the pleasure of interviewing Ned

00:41.815 --> 00:47.641
Walton, class of? 63. 63. Ned, to introduce 
yourself to anyone that might hear the tape or read

00:50.323 --> 00:59.232
a transcription, give a biographical summary of, 
your background and family and where you grew up,

00:59.887 --> 01:05.574
went to high school and so forth, before you came to 
A&M. High school I was raised up in what's called

01:06.155 --> 01:23.195
the Arklatex area, about halfway between 
Texarkana and Shreveport, right on the state

01:06.155 --> 01:23.195
line, a little place called Walton Center. It 
actually was the state line. Our farm bordered the

01:27.260 --> 01:29.843
state line. and one of six children. Three boys, 
three girls. There was actually four boys. One boy

01:41.988 --> 01:50.279
died as an infant a couple weeks old with 
pneumonia, whooping cough, something of that

01:41.988 --> 01:50.279
sort back in the old days. Hard to treat in those 
days. But I was raised there in the architects.

01:57.909 --> 02:01.033
We had a history there in the family. My dad worked 
for an oil company. He was an oil field pumper and

02:06.188 --> 02:08.411
gauger. The old Standard Oil of Indiana brand, 
Amoco, and some of those companies are part of that

02:10.053 --> 02:16.822
family. The oil field up in that area consisted of 
the McLeod oil field, the Rhodessa oil field, and

02:18.504 --> 02:27.777
the Oil City area. And all of that was just on the 
edge of that big East Texas oil field. So I was

02:32.143 --> 02:33.124
raised in that part of the world, and some people 
call that still in the oil patch.

02:40.416 --> 02:49.106
Very well brought up by my parents to appreciate 
everything in life, to appreciate education. My

02:49.446 --> 03:00.478
dad was very insistent that the kids get 
education, and he said there will always be a way

02:49.446 --> 03:00.478
for you to go to school. I went to McLeod.

03:06.616 --> 03:15.970
McLeod was 12 grades all on one campus, separated 
between the first six grades and the second six

03:06.616 --> 03:15.970
grades by the cafeteria and the auditorium. How 
many in your senior grade? I had about 20 or 21 in my

03:18.574 --> 03:24.984
senior class, which was a very, very large class 
for McLeod. It was a little class B school back in

03:26.046 --> 03:30.212
those days, and there were... I believe maybe five 
boys in that class, and the rest were girls. Or

03:36.682 --> 03:38.124
maybe I have that reversed. I don't even remember 
now. But there were not a lot of us, and I

03:39.006 --> 03:55.812
had a real interesting thing to happen to me when I 
was in high school that really prepared me and let

03:39.006 --> 03:55.812
me come to A&M. I had done well in high school as a 
student, but the course offerings were rather

03:56.467 --> 04:02.515
limited. There was a young man that graduated from 
East Texas State and went up to the University of

04:02.575 --> 04:14.650
Oklahoma and got degrees in math and physics. He 
was a high school classmate at McLeod of one of my

04:14.830 --> 04:18.575
older sisters. The boy's name was Ross Evans. Ross 
was hired by NASA. before NASA existed. He

04:29.156 --> 04:34.502
received his master's at, like I said, OU in math 
and physics. And they had a job for him at

04:34.662 --> 04:39.587
Huntsville, Alabama, whenever Huntsville got up 
and running. And there was a one-year lag in

04:40.528 --> 04:46.814
between the time he graduated from OU and starting 
his NASA job. And he came to McLeod High School and

04:47.214 --> 04:49.317
taught. And in my senior year, he taught me 
physics, trigonometry, solid geometry, and I

04:53.251 --> 04:58.397
guess what we'd call precalculus. And he said, if 
you're going to go to one of the major schools, an

04:59.658 --> 05:07.848
A&M or Texas or whatever, you really need this 
preparation. And probably had it not been for

05:08.108 --> 05:12.473
that, I'd have a much tougher time at A&M than what I 
did. But that's where I came from. It's a little bit

05:14.956 --> 05:17.218
of my background. My mother was from Arkansas. My 
father His ancestors settled a little place of

05:22.124 --> 05:38.083
Walton Center there on the state line, and 
actually not only there in Walton Center, but in

05:22.124 --> 05:38.083
Caddo Parish, Louisiana, Miller County, 
Arkansas, Cass County, Texas. That was pretty

05:39.085 --> 05:51.760
much the centroid area of where the Waltons 
landed, and still have the farm there in Walton

05:39.085 --> 05:51.760
Center, and one of my sisters lives there on the 
farm. Did you come to visit A&M before you came to

05:51.942 --> 05:54.868
enroll? I had been to A&M one time. Now, my brother, 
my oldest brother, 12 years my senior, spent two

05:57.855 --> 06:06.854
years at what was called Magnolia A&M. I guess that 
was in... trying to think what Arkansas, I guess

06:11.838 --> 06:16.685
it's maybe Arkansas State now. Anyway, at 
Magnolia A&M, a little place in Magnolia,

06:17.527 --> 06:30.066
Arkansas, and transferred to A&M and spent three 
years at A&M and took a petroleum engineering

06:17.527 --> 06:30.066
degree, class of 51. And so I had a chance when I was a 
very small child to come down one time and had no

06:30.485 --> 06:38.392
impression whatsoever of being here. But my 
brother put me in Aggie T-shirts and that sort of

06:38.973 --> 06:44.758
thing when I was a kid. And I can remember some 
photographs of wearing the Aggie T-shirt that my

06:44.818 --> 06:50.963
brother had brought to me. But that was my only real 
connection direct with A&M when I was a youngster.

06:58.951 --> 07:00.492
Now, we had a lot of history. both in the Walton 
family and in McCloud that was A&M related. And so I

07:06.498 --> 07:11.322
had a real strong push, if you will, to consider 
A&M. So you came to A&M largely for impersonal

07:11.382 --> 07:20.511
reasons, by that I mean without any direct 
contact. Did some teachers encourage you? Yes, my

07:23.474 --> 07:28.639
high school principal was an Aggie, Lewis Hamm. 
Went on to become superintendent at McLeod, and

07:29.429 --> 07:36.541
then superintendent at Como-Picton, also over in 
East Texas. And my brother, an Aggie, I had several

07:36.841 --> 07:47.478
cousins that were Aggies. The three McLeod boys, 
Max, Curtis, and Gerald, were all A&M graduates by

07:48.360 --> 07:54.610
that time. James Odom, who was two classes ahead of 
me, and Jim Stewart, three classes ahead of me,

07:55.028 --> 08:03.453
McLeod graduates all came to A&M. In fact, Jim 
Stewart was a civil engineering graduate, and I he

08:07.330 --> 08:10.053
probably had a little bit of influence going into 
the civil area. I really started in math and

08:10.074 --> 08:17.743
physics because of this high school teacher, Ross 
Evans, who was going to NASA. I really enjoyed the

08:18.304 --> 08:30.920
math and physics that I got as a senior, so I went 
from math and physics to civil engineering, back

08:18.304 --> 08:30.920
to math and physics, and back to civil 
engineering, all in my freshman year, and finally

08:18.304 --> 08:30.920
settled on civil engineering. So maybe it was 
impersonal reasons that I came to A&M, but there

08:30.940 --> 08:36.207
was a long history of some McLeod folks coming to 
A&M and then relatives coming to A&M. Now, you come

08:42.337 --> 08:44.801
down to enroll in the fall of 58 or 59? 59. I actually 
came to summer school for six weeks. Describe

08:49.769 --> 08:50.370
that. Very interesting. Really, it was my 
brother's recommendation. He said, little

08:58.383 --> 08:59.865
brother, You're going to get down there in that 
forest of trees, and you're not going to know where

09:00.082 --> 09:12.238
you are or what you're doing, and it's going to be 
very traumatic for you coming out of McLeod. I know

09:12.839 --> 09:18.927
it was traumatic for me going from Magnolia A&M 
down there to spend a few years. So I think it would

09:19.008 --> 09:22.132
be good for you to go down there in summer school. So 
I worked half that summer and came down for the

09:22.212 --> 09:28.941
second session of summer school. and took college 
algebra and college trig, I guess it was, and

09:29.360 --> 09:37.934
that's six weeks of summer school. You lived on 
campus. Lived on campus. Let me think.

09:48.125 --> 09:54.492
Haskell, I believe in that summer I lived in what 
they would call Mitchell Hall. I believe it was

09:54.872 --> 09:56.334
Mitchell Hall. And I remember very much the Grove, 
Guyon Hall, things from that summer. It was a very

10:05.704 --> 10:08.207
fast six weeks. Oh, it was extremely fast. And you 
did okay academically? Well, I would say we did

10:12.171 --> 10:14.093
okay. I think I made a couple of B's maybe in those 
classes. And then you go home. Go home. What did you

10:22.293 --> 10:24.877
tell your folks your impression was? I told them it 
was a go. I really enjoyed it, and I was looking

10:26.859 --> 10:33.528
forward to going back for the fall semester, being 
in the Corps. And at that point, your major was

10:33.688 --> 10:36.952
going to be what? Math and physics. And what did you 
think that was going to lead to? I had no earthly

10:40.757 --> 10:43.140
idea, Haskell. It was a matter of... of Ross really 
encouraging me in the math and physics area. By the

10:51.470 --> 10:52.994
way, I saw him Thanksgiving. I told him that 
whether he knows it or not, he was a large part of my

10:53.034 --> 10:58.125
life in the years ahead. This is your older 
brother? No, this is the guy that taught the math

11:02.489 --> 11:06.793
and physics to me in high school. Oh, how good. Yes, 
I just, you know, that really meant something to me

11:08.374 --> 11:19.425
that you probably don't know, but probably had I 
not had that experience, I would have had a real

11:08.374 --> 11:19.425
difficult time in engineering at A&M. But I had no 
idea where math and physics, well, maybe it would

11:19.445 --> 11:26.492
lead me to NASA or somewhere like that, high 
school, but... Now, you go home then, and as you

11:26.472 --> 11:32.702
come back to enroll, how did you get down here? My 
daddy put me in a 55

11:33.304 --> 11:39.454
model Studebaker. Wow.

11:42.519 --> 11:48.309
That was the first new car my dad ever bought, was a 
55 Studebaker. Little 600 Champion. And he had put

11:51.008 --> 11:57.088
me in a little 50-mile Studebaker when I was in high 
school. So he passed that? When I say he put me in it,

11:58.211 --> 12:02.385
we worked together and we bought that little 
Studebaker. But he passed down... a 55 Studebaker

12:04.053 --> 12:07.779
Champion to me when I came to A&M. And he bought him a 
little 59 model Lark Studebaker, a little station

12:07.799 --> 12:13.047
wagon. Something behind that one, too, because 
when my dad died, I inherited that vehicle to

12:13.127 --> 12:18.917
finish up school. But he put me that little 55 
Studebaker, and I drove to A&M in that little 55

12:18.957 --> 12:23.865
Studebaker. As you can remember, what stuff did 
you bring home? in that car to become a freshman?

12:30.941 --> 12:31.762
Not much. A footlocker, which they had told us we 
had to have. One blanket, a couple of changes of

12:36.550 --> 12:45.525
bedding, towels, washcloths, that sort of thing. 
Very, very nominal shoes and socks and underwear

12:46.987 --> 12:53.037
and pants and that sort of stuff. Very, very 
minimum. No furniture, no rugs, nothing like

12:55.201 --> 12:58.807
that. It was essentially a foot locker and a couple 
of sacks full of them. Did you know before you got

13:01.571 --> 13:09.483
down here on that trip, did you know what outfit you 
were going to be in? Haskell, I don't believe I did.

13:11.427 --> 13:21.883
I believe that when we got down and started the 
enrollment process, of course the enrollment

13:11.427 --> 13:21.883
process was different then than what I 
experienced as a prof there, but I was assigned to

13:22.252 --> 13:26.337
an engineering company. And it was real 
interesting because the engineering company,

13:27.279 --> 13:39.114
all of the freshmen essentially that went into 
that outfit, and that was H-1 became G-2 after a

13:27.279 --> 13:39.114
year or so. H-1 was disbanded. All of the freshmen, 
essentially in that outfit, were engineers, but

13:41.641 --> 13:49.315
very few of the upperclassmen were engineers. 
They had already gone off to business and

13:49.896 --> 13:55.986
agriculture, some of the other majors. 
Engineering seemed to be a real tough washout in

13:56.106 --> 13:59.512
those days. What kind of advice... an instruction 
did a new fish get in that outfit? Oh, goodness,

14:07.745 --> 14:22.954
Haskell, that there would be call to quarters and 
that it would be monitored very rigorously and

14:07.745 --> 14:22.954
that you were expected to be at four-point stance 
at your desk during all call to quarters, which

14:22.934 --> 14:27.158
which meant arms and elbows on the chair arms and 
feet on the floor. During call to quarters, you

14:27.759 --> 14:32.324
couldn't prop your feet up, couldn't lean back in 
your chair. You had to be right at that desk.

14:35.347 --> 14:43.896
Academics really seemed to be real prime to the 
first sergeant, a boy named Charlie Rollins, and

14:35.347 --> 14:43.896
to the CO. They really said, you know, you're 
really going to have to work hard to make it

14:48.280 --> 14:51.906
academically because not many of you are going to 
make it through your freshman year. Not many of us

14:52.207 --> 14:53.849
did as a matter of fact. And you were in what dorm? We 
were in dorm 14. That was called the old dorm area.

15:02.283 --> 15:07.833
The new dorm area was dorm 2 through 12 over on the 
other side of campus. But that was the old dorm area

15:07.853 --> 15:12.280
and dorm 14 was the guard room. a dorm located on the 
bottom floor. I guess that would be roughly the

15:15.783 --> 15:18.926
north end of that dorm. We were in dorm 14. And you 
get a roommate or so. Yes. Describe that roommate

15:25.353 --> 15:29.677
and that room and how y'all worked it out. That 
roommate was a boy named

15:29.857 --> 15:37.305
Bill Burnett. Bill had two brothers, Duke Burnett 
and Don Burnett, who were upperclassmen at the

15:38.213 --> 15:47.411
time. One was a sophomore and junior. The other was 
a senior at A&M at the time. Bill came in as a

15:51.479 --> 15:52.681
freshman. It was from Terrell, a friend of one Jim 
Keller. from Terrell, who was on the football team

15:59.392 --> 16:07.468
as a freshman, and of course later coached some at 
A&M. But Bill was my official lady. Bill was no

16:15.980 --> 16:24.553
better prepared for the shock of the coronation 
than I was, even though he came from a larger place.

16:25.134 --> 16:31.303
It was just, you know, for the first few weeks, it 
was just trauma one day after the other. You didn't

16:31.343 --> 16:34.488
know what to expect or what was coming up next. What 
did the upperclassmen tell you all to do and not to

16:36.551 --> 16:42.139
do?

16:43.317 --> 16:54.553
told us all those things that you had to do like 
whipping out and how you were to eat in the mess hall

16:43.317 --> 16:54.553
at Sabisa and things, other things not to do. Be 
real careful around the bulls. Make sure that you

17:00.661 --> 17:06.169
learned how to address them and salute them real 
quick and All those were the proper dos and what

17:06.605 --> 17:09.911
have you. And the don'ts were don't mess with 
upperclassmen. Leave them alone and no water

17:14.219 --> 17:22.514
drown outs, you know, no babble bombs, that sort of 
thing in the dorms. But be prepared for the first

17:23.556 --> 17:26.622
water fight. be prepared for the first male fight 
in Sebesa, that they would come. That was just part

17:31.509 --> 17:33.972
of old Army bull. And we were, I will tell you, we 
were taught and told what to expect. Did they give

17:40.481 --> 17:44.746
you any advice about going to class and studying 
and taking notes? Well, they did. In each of the

17:45.527 --> 17:55.140
outfits, there was a scholastic officer, if you 
will, and a scholastic sergeant. And then there

17:55.593 --> 18:03.813
was somebody assigned to make sure that all of the 
freshmen were at their desk during call to

17:55.593 --> 18:03.813
quarters. And they monitored our attendance and 
monitored our grades. They would ask on a weekly

18:08.245 --> 18:10.851
basis how we were doing. And had, you know, the 
scholastic sergeant, best I remember, had the old

18:11.270 --> 18:20.023
poop file. You know, there was a room in the core 
dorm, and I guess every company had it, where

18:20.924 --> 18:32.560
literally there were just dozens of files of old 
quizzes from every prof on campus. And so they kind

18:32.801 --> 18:38.168
of taught you a little bit how to old poop it. And 
that seemed to be part of the process. Did you and

18:40.936 --> 18:44.019
other fish go down and look at those files? Oh, 
goodness, yes. Oh, yes. And it was very

18:46.002 --> 18:54.711
disheartening to go into a file and not be able to 
find anything on a particular prof, especially

18:46.002 --> 18:54.711
one that you were really afraid of, a prof that was 
really. Do you remember any of the courses that

18:55.132 --> 18:58.576
first semester? Yes. And that's what I'm going to 
tell you about one. And this can certainly go into

19:01.479 --> 19:04.603
the record. You taught me History 105 as a first 
semester freshman. and why i remember that so well

19:10.687 --> 19:36.947
is that you went through the total roster asking 
every freshman where was hometown and when i told

19:10.687 --> 19:36.947
you hometown was mcleod you said oh yes that's up in 
northeast texas just on the state line across from

19:10.687 --> 19:36.947
louisiana and i was tremendously impressed with 
that and still don't know till today haskell and

19:10.687 --> 19:36.947
perhaps someday you'll confess to me You either 
knew your history extremely well and geography

19:36.927 --> 19:49.862
better, or you had reviewed that roster and had 
gone to the map and tried to find where all these

19:36.927 --> 19:49.862
students were from. And it was just absolutely 
delightful for me to know that you knew where I kind

19:50.103 --> 19:58.733
of started saying, oh my goodness, There's hope. 
People know where McLeod is. As far as I know, it was

20:02.076 --> 20:07.541
just having had that trivia memory of where the 
towns are. That was fall of 59, and you were, I don't

20:07.661 --> 20:16.530
know if you were fish or not yourself, you were a 
first year or very close to just arriving at A&M.

20:16.550 --> 20:17.230
That was my first year. I had come from Rice. I had a 
temporary nine-month job that lasted 21 years.

20:23.156 --> 20:23.996
How interesting. I was filling in for a guy that was 
on leave, And in the middle of the year, he said he

20:27.535 --> 20:33.664
wouldn't come back, and so Dr. Nance told me I could 
stay. Well, I'll be... Yeah, I remember that. Some

20:37.249 --> 20:38.591
other first semester. I certainly remember the 
courses. I remember that first English class,

20:41.375 --> 20:46.422
and... how disheartening two or three D's and F's 
in a row were on the first papers of what they were

20:46.891 --> 20:56.649
requiring. It was so different from what we had 
seen in high school, but got with the program

20:56.669 --> 21:04.123
fairly soon. And I was not just a real outstanding 
freshman student. As far as that goes, I don't

21:08.712 --> 21:12.560
guess I was an outstanding student in 
undergraduate school at all. I got through and was

21:12.580 --> 21:15.145
not ashamed of it. Got me into graduate school and 
through a Ph.D. program. But you didn't make any

21:17.450 --> 21:20.155
low grades that first semester, did you? I don't 
believe I made a D. I think everything was C or

21:23.003 --> 21:28.548
better that first semester. And you were taking 
about how many hours? Oh, goodness, Haskell. Back

21:31.471 --> 21:36.015
then, see, a civil engineering degree was 160 
hours. So we were, and six of that was in summer

21:36.475 --> 21:47.024
school between your junior and senior year, which 
was the surveying camp out at Junction, which I

21:36.475 --> 21:47.024
remember very well, too. But we were taking 19 or 20 
hours every semester. You had to. And by the way, I

21:52.349 --> 21:59.816
graduated in eight semesters plus two summers. I 
laid out one semester, first semester of my

22:03.065 --> 22:07.290
sophomore year. I lost my father. And I laid out a 
semester to kind of get things together and find

22:09.792 --> 22:17.781
money to come back to school. And that's where I 
developed a very strong banking relationship

22:17.861 --> 22:25.630
with folks in Bryan College Station to help me go to 
school. It scared me to this day, as a matter of

22:25.610 --> 22:28.074
fact. I developed friendships back then that 
still exist. But I was 18, 19, probably at least as

22:31.800 --> 22:39.332
an average. I don't know of any semesters that I had 
the luxury of 12, 14, 15. I don't remember anything

22:43.659 --> 22:45.582
like that. Describe as much as you can your typical 
life. weekday routine during that freshman year?

22:53.650 --> 22:55.594
What time did you get up and what did you do when? 
Gosh, it was, in retrospect, I can look back and say

22:55.874 --> 23:04.230
it wasn't all that bad, but at the time it was 
absolutely horrible. It was getting up at whistle

23:04.751 --> 23:13.487
jock, blowing the whistle at I guess 6.15, 6.30 in 
the morning. You're getting up in the shower and

23:13.855 --> 23:25.201
shaving, cleaning up, getting your uniform on, 
preparing your room for inspection, which was

23:13.855 --> 23:25.201
going to happen sometime whether you wanted it to 
or not. And going to chow and just putting it down as

23:31.034 --> 23:58.830
fast as you could feed it in your mouth because of 
time constraint, getting back to the room and

23:31.034 --> 23:58.830
being sure that you had a quarter flippin' off of 
your bed top, you know, tightly pulled together,

23:31.034 --> 23:58.830
military corners and everything, and knowing 
some upperclassmen gonna come back by and take a

23:31.034 --> 23:58.830
look, probably even before class, and harass you, 
kind of delay you time-wise, and then trying to

23:31.034 --> 23:58.830
rush to that first class. pretty much in class. 
There was not a lot of free time during the day. You

24:03.941 --> 24:08.627
were in class, it seems like, much more than they 
are now. You know, if you were taking 18, 19 hours

24:08.667 --> 24:15.355
with a couple of laboratories, you know, you add 
another six hours. You were literally in class 25,

24:15.555 --> 24:18.579
26 hours a week. And engineering graphics was even 
worse than that. That was a two-hour credit class.

24:22.604 --> 24:29.772
I think we were spending maybe eight hours in the 
classroom on engineering graphics, so it was real

24:22.604 --> 24:29.772
heavy, real heavy in the classroom. If you had any 
free time during the day, Where did you spend that

24:33.674 --> 24:35.517
time? Well, you know, you would want to go back to 
your room, but goodness, the upperclassmen, I

24:35.537 --> 24:43.529
mean, that was, you were asking for it if you went 
back to your room. Now, that was punishment. The

24:45.092 --> 24:49.258
upperclassmen see you come down the hall, Fish 
Walton, what are you doing, and where are you

24:45.092 --> 24:49.258
going? And they would occupy your time for you. So 
we found other places to go. We'd go to the Student

24:53.705 --> 24:57.150
Center, MSC. We would hang out there. Couldn't go 
off campus, obviously. I mean, a freshman had no

25:01.605 --> 25:06.654
right to go off campus for any reason at any time. 
Maybe venture a little bit off campus on Sunday to

25:06.714 --> 25:11.522
go to church. That was about it. You didn't go off on 
weekends and what have you until it was announced

25:13.245 --> 25:19.476
usually at Saturday drill. a free afternoon, 
which meant that you could go out on Saturday night

25:20.097 --> 25:31.121
and go to the campus theater or even go downtown to 
the palace or somewhere if you felt like you wanted

25:20.097 --> 25:31.121
to, but a busy, busy day. That freshman year, did 
you find any place where you could go slip off and

25:31.422 --> 25:35.912
take a nap? like in the library? Haskell, yes, I did 
in fact go to the library and sneak naps because you

25:38.084 --> 25:45.516
weren't sleeping well at night. At the time, you 
know, have a few wake-ups in the middle of the night

25:45.756 --> 25:54.930
to run a few times around campus or go into the 
shower and have a you know, one of the sessions in

25:54.910 --> 26:02.818
the shower, the upperclassmen's, where they turn 
on all the hot water and see how long you last, you

25:54.910 --> 26:02.818
know, that sort of thing. So, yeah, a library was a 
frequent place to go to. Well, not only, and I will

26:06.001 --> 26:15.551
admit to you, I even used the library for academic 
purposes, but yes, I've been known to sneaking up

26:06.001 --> 26:15.551
at the library. Now, when y'all, in the dorm you 
were in, when y'all fell out to march to chow, where

26:15.571 --> 26:21.677
did you Y'all fell out right in front of the dorm? 
Right in that quadrangle that was between 14, 15,

26:23.867 --> 26:28.653
and 16. They formed a U there in that quad, and we 
fell out in that quad area. It was a flagpole right

26:34.660 --> 26:40.067
at the end of the quad, and we marched right 
straight up to Sabisa. How often did y'all go over

26:40.768 --> 26:45.994
to the core area, the new core area? toward Duncan 
and participate in anything over there? The only

26:49.406 --> 26:53.953
time we essentially got together like that was on 
Saturdays. We'd all go to the drill field on

26:54.273 --> 27:00.682
Saturdays or some other place where we had, and we 
had Saturday drills every Saturday. I don't

27:00.702 --> 27:06.190
remember not having drills on Saturday for my 
total core experience. And

27:06.571 --> 27:14.462
that was either on the drill field or somewhere 
else. we would uh... see we got moved see I laid out

27:15.269 --> 27:35.134
that first semester of my sophomore year and I came 
back in to the core really beginning of my junior

27:15.269 --> 27:35.134
year and we had moved over to what's called the new 
dorm area uh... H-1 had been disbanded and we

27:15.269 --> 27:35.134
became G-2 And so then we were located. Then we were 
in dorm two, which was the core dorm, where

27:37.283 --> 27:45.259
headquarters was located, and ended up in dorm 
two. And so, of course, all of our fallouts and

27:45.519 --> 27:52.212
everything was in that big quadrangle there. Now, 
and I should have asked earlier, there was no fish

27:52.799 --> 27:56.166
camp. No, no fish camp. And did they give you all any 
advice on how to study, how to prepare? Did

28:06.826 --> 28:08.189
anybody? Haskell, very minimal, if anything. 
Again, even most of the upperclassmen were not

28:13.336 --> 28:16.422
engineers. They'd already gone to marketing and 
business and what have you. And they told us about

28:19.288 --> 28:22.133
call to quarters. Maybe there was a little bit, 
they did encourage us to go to the library, spend as

28:27.663 --> 28:36.651
much time in the library as we could, use the old 
quiz files and what have you as much as we could. If

28:36.711 --> 28:40.314
there were such things as review sessions, we'd go 
to review sessions. But those were extremely

28:40.354 --> 28:43.356
limited in those days. And we had to sign out, of 
course, to go to places like that. If you left CQ and

28:48.601 --> 28:57.568
called quarters and said, I'm going to the 
library, upperclassmen had to sign your, and you

28:48.601 --> 28:57.568
put that on your door. You go to the library, you 
better be in the library. And then they checked up

29:00.474 --> 29:02.980
on you every once in a while. That fish year, did you 
and your buddies attempt any goofy stuff in the

29:03.080 --> 29:07.831
chow hall? Yeah. Any tricks, pranks? Well, yeah. 
We were involved in, you know. Such as?

29:19.520 --> 29:28.315
Accidentally flipping a whole bowl full of stewed 
tomatoes and boiled okra off on an upperclassman.

29:28.355 --> 29:36.229
Be clumsy and feign it, and then pay the penalty for 
it. We could not start food fights. That was left to

29:41.258 --> 29:43.021
the upperclassmen. But we participated. I can 
remember putting the old big rolls in the water

29:44.144 --> 29:51.156
pitchers and splattering those all over. Many, 
many times I was a good hog caller. And the week of

29:55.885 --> 30:04.275
Arkansas game, freshmen had to stand up in their 
chair at the chow hall and call the hogs. And I was a

30:04.375 --> 30:10.241
pretty good hog caller, being an old farm boy, so I 
got to do that a lot.

30:12.944 --> 30:18.030
Got to poke fun at Rice and SMU and some of the other 
schools during those weeks. Do you remember what

30:18.050 --> 30:24.137
it was like to go to those first football games as a 
fish? Yeah, it was, you were lucky if you could have

30:24.202 --> 30:33.456
the opportunity to have a date to go, you know. Most 
all those football games were, we marched in, and

30:34.818 --> 30:41.388
most of us, most fish without dates. I mean, we were 
far, far from home, and it was hard to get a girl in.

30:48.038 --> 30:50.682
So what did you and your buddies do then after the 
game was over? Oh, Haskell, goodness. You know,

30:56.911 --> 31:07.909
other than chasing down the Yale leaders and 
participating in that kind of revelry, I don't

30:56.911 --> 31:07.909
recall a lot of things real exciting happening 
after the ball games. Did, at that point, that

31:08.670 --> 31:13.377
freshman year, did you have some spending money? 
Did you have a kind of a budget? Very, very limited.

31:17.527 --> 31:21.572
had you earned it, or had your parents given it to 
you, or some of both? It was a little bit of both. My

31:25.356 --> 31:34.386
dad, again, was very insistent that I was going to 
school, was very pleased that I was going to A&M

31:25.356 --> 31:34.386
because big brother had graduated from A&M. He was 
very much against my oldest brother coming to A&M.

31:37.710 --> 31:44.378
He wanted my oldest brother to be a school teacher 
and did not need to go all the way down to College

31:37.710 --> 31:44.378
Station to get a
