WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:02.154
Okay. First of all, to go to A&M, and second, to meet 
Gabe Anderson, who was really one of the finest

00:03.095 --> 00:13.288
human beings you'll ever meet, and was really 
quite an influence on me at A&M. In what way? Just

00:14.930 --> 00:19.595
being a good friend and a good roommate and being 
right, correct. What do you mean correct? Honest?

00:22.819 --> 00:23.881
Well, honest. He just had good human...

00:30.608 --> 00:34.292
coordination with others, and just a fine man. And 
he'd been a very successful man in business, I

00:34.372 --> 00:36.935
might add. What happened to him? What business? 
Where'd he go? He wanted to, and I might say I was

00:42.600 --> 00:49.327
very fortunate to get into C Battery, too, which 
maybe we can develop later. Gabe Anderson went in

00:50.468 --> 00:56.835
on active duty, of course, same time the rest of us 
did. He wound up in the 1st Army Division in Africa

00:57.254 --> 01:03.001
and then later in Europe and went through the war 
with that division.

01:05.744 --> 01:07.946
And I understand was a very fine officer. And when 
he came back, he really wanted to stay in the Army.

01:16.776 --> 01:26.788
But then it developed that he did stay for,

01:16.776 --> 01:26.788
I guess, a couple of years, as I recall.

01:28.928 --> 01:32.451
But then he decided to get out, and he went back home 
to Farwell. Farwell, you know, is right in that

01:33.152 --> 01:41.500
great High Plains farm country over there. And he 
went into the grain elevator business. When he was

01:43.562 --> 01:52.651
in high school,

01:43.562 --> 01:52.651
he had worked for a grain elevator at Farwell. And 
he knew something about it, and he liked it. And

01:56.063 --> 01:58.025
that was good grain country. This is before the, as 
I recall it, this is before the irrigation days,

01:58.045 --> 02:06.115
however, that he went into the grain elevator 
business then on his own. I think he had a partner or

02:06.515 --> 02:08.958
two initially. And then they just started 
irrigating that country and took off. And dang, he

02:15.966 --> 02:23.775
had more grain elevators standing than most 
ranchers had cattle. and just handled it

02:24.532 --> 02:26.134
beautifully. And I think when you get into 
something that big, you've got to know what you're

02:26.254 --> 02:30.480
doing to do it well. Anyway, he's been very, very 
successful. We still, all through the years,

02:34.625 --> 02:38.691
we've corresponded. Everybody's a poor letter 
writer now, but every once in a while, maybe the

02:40.453 --> 02:46.381
average of every six months, I'll call him and 
he'll call me. And we'll literally talk for a half

02:46.501 --> 02:52.429
hour, 45 minutes over the telephone.

02:56.628 --> 03:03.498
Well, I'm certain he's a multi-millionaire, but I 
don't have any idea. But you'd never know it from

03:03.618 --> 03:14.493
his conduct or

03:03.618 --> 03:14.493
by comparing him today with what he always had 
been. Okay. When you went to A&M, when you first

03:16.116 --> 03:26.230
thought about going to A&M, did the idea of the 
military have anything to do with your decision?

03:26.480 --> 03:27.782
Because it's a military school. Everybody had to 
be in the Corps then. No, it really didn't. As a

03:32.408 --> 03:36.094
matter of fact, I knew it was a military school. 
That didn't bother me, but I had no particular

03:36.114 --> 03:41.081
objectives in the military end of it. I did think 
that, as I still do, that in this country and under

03:41.301 --> 03:53.398
our system, it's a good idea to be a reserve officer 
if you're capable and have the opportunities. And

03:54.138 --> 04:02.368
if you're ever called in the Army, I think as a 
enlisted man, or in the services, or an officer,

03:54.138 --> 04:02.368
you should serve to the limits of your capacity. 
I've had very promising citizen soldiers in World

04:02.448 --> 04:22.231
War II, for example, in some cases in Vietnam, who 
appeared to have everything on the ball you need,

04:02.448 --> 04:22.231
but when you suggested they be commissioned, they 
don't want it because they don't want the

04:02.448 --> 04:22.231
responsibility. Well, of course, then that 
separates them. I think there's an obligation to

04:25.711 --> 04:30.558
serve to your capacity. But no, I had no, I had very 
little military knowledge and background at that

04:30.578 --> 04:36.948
stage. And I knew that in the Spanish-American 
War, my father had just completed organizing a

04:36.988 --> 04:51.249
company, local company, to go to the 
Spanish-American War when, you know, it was a very

04:36.988 --> 04:51.249
brief war. It was called off. Sure. He was too old to 
be... to serve in World War I. His father and his

05:02.178 --> 05:10.208
father's brother were in Hood's Coward Civil War. 
And of course we didn't do a very good job of

05:12.110 --> 05:21.201
preserving the details on that, but that was a 
matter of proud history. On my mother's side, her

05:25.381 --> 05:30.167
Her father was too young for the Civil War, but his 
brothers were in the war. And, of course, they had a

05:30.187 --> 05:36.374
better family history to hand down on that than the 
Becker side. Those things fascinated me, but they

05:38.757 --> 05:43.242
didn't really set any goals for me in the military. 
So I just went in to be an A&M cadet, or a student, and

05:43.363 --> 05:48.909
thereby a cadet, and that's where I started. And at 
no time did you ever think of going to the military

05:48.929 --> 05:55.337
academy, for example. No, not really.

06:01.221 --> 06:06.668
Because one of your brothers went to Princeton, 
right? Isn't that what you told me? Yeah. Oh, yeah,

06:09.111 --> 06:10.112
okay. And so he left Texas, and I was wondering if 
your dad ever thought that you should leave Texas

06:10.132 --> 06:17.942
for any other university. No, I never really had 
any desire to leave Texas. In fact, I never got out

06:20.045 --> 06:25.932
of the state boundaries until I went there and went 
to a football game in Arkansas. No, I never

06:28.055 --> 06:32.060
considered the military. I didn't want, you know, 
it was not consciously after a military career.

06:35.924 --> 06:48.879
And I think if I had been urged to go to West Point, 
for example, I probably would have turned down

06:35.924 --> 06:48.879
because it was, not because what I knew about it, 
but because of what I didn't know about it. You just

06:48.899 --> 06:50.581
didn't know anything about the military. That's 
right. Okay, all right. Now, what were your first

06:53.464 --> 06:56.948
impressions when you arrived at A&M?

07:00.033 --> 07:08.004
Well, my first impressions were that I was in a 
totally different world. But except for the

07:08.024 --> 07:14.894
pressures of being a fish, I liked everything I 
saw. What do you mean, a totally different world?

07:17.277 --> 07:17.738
In what way? Well, I had just never been in an 
environment with people organized like that,

07:18.199 --> 07:29.635
with this vast plant. which even in those days 
appeared to us to be a vast physical plant. And I was

07:35.472 --> 07:42.078
having my horizon open on what education is. And 
that first week, it just seemed too much to take in.

07:49.426 --> 07:54.711
I guess I'm saying that's a country boy's reaction 
to going to college. I had never been on that campus

07:55.771 --> 07:57.934
before. That's another question I wanted to ask. 
Never been on that campus. So this is the first time

08:00.597 --> 08:04.803
that you have. Of course, when you went to the A&M in 
those days, and after that first two weeks or so, I

08:04.823 --> 08:15.777
was in a military outfit, that takes over your 
life. Okay, what outfit were you in again? I was in C

08:19.622 --> 08:21.745
Battery Field Artillery.

08:24.509 --> 08:26.852
First Battalion of the Field Artillery Regiment. 
And the reason I was there because I met Gabe

08:28.534 --> 08:33.842
Anderson. Right, right. And where'd you live? I 
lived in Leggett Hall those first two years, and

08:36.165 --> 08:42.193
then the second two years we moved over to the new 
area. What was then the new area? Quad, they called

08:45.077 --> 08:46.519
it now. Did you eat at Sabisa? I ate at Sabisa Hall. 
What did you think of the food? I thought it was

08:51.766 --> 08:52.407
good. I always thought the food at A&M was good. 
What did you think of the accommodations? It

08:59.459 --> 09:00.400
wasn't that important. Those rooms were small, 
and that old legged hall wasn't very fancy, and you

09:02.422 --> 09:10.311
had to sweep awful hard to get the dirt off the 
floor. But that wasn't all that important.

09:16.118 --> 09:22.225
We had an entirely different view of facility 
requirements then, I'm sure, as compared to

09:16.118 --> 09:22.225
today. What was important, now? The important 
thing to me, and I think all of us there, was we'd

09:24.280 --> 09:35.011
just come out of a, well, we were not really fully 
out of that depression in 37. Sure, absolutely.

09:37.573 --> 09:48.324
And I just felt darn lucky that I got to arrive there 
with the prospect of completing an education

09:37.573 --> 09:48.324
there. Now, that really was, boy, that's what was 
important to me. I knew what work was. I'd learned

09:54.815 --> 09:55.636
that here. Our father kept us busy all the time. If I 
can hark back to that a bit, he had these five boys.

10:04.444 --> 10:11.671
Of course, Brian's a little young, but the four of 
us had chores to do morning and night. Naturally,

10:12.592 --> 10:14.453
you would in a place this big. And when you get out of 
school in the summertime, the first thing we did

10:15.795 --> 10:21.540
was cut oats and shock them. and thrashing. Then 
we'd bale hay for seemed to me like months. It was

10:28.357 --> 10:30.619
actually weeks. And we'd haul cordwood to that 
cotton gin. That boiler was fired by wood,

10:35.344 --> 10:40.249
furnace. He'd use about 300 cords of wood a year. 
And so each of us have a team of mules or a team of

10:44.514 --> 10:52.422
horses in the wagon to just haul cord after cord to 
stack over there. that were cut out of these woods

10:52.672 --> 10:54.995
here on the place. And if it wasn't time to start 
ginning cotton by the time that was done, we'd go to

10:57.478 --> 11:10.013
the cotton patches, whole cotton or something of 
that sort. So anyway, I knew what worked. And as a

11:14.198 --> 11:20.485
matter of fact, I knew that

11:14.198 --> 11:20.485
I was going to have to work summer and at school to be 
able to make it than I did. I

11:25.522 --> 11:40.683
remember when Dad, when I left to go to A&M, Dad 
handed me a checkbook and says, take this with you

11:25.522 --> 11:40.683
and use it when you need it. Just remember, don't 
have any money.

11:45.009 --> 11:47.292
And so that's the way I used it. That's the way I used 
it. Were you employed on your A&M? I worked at what

11:51.650 --> 11:57.216
they call the student labor program. You were 
allowed to work for the college 12 hours a week at

11:58.077 --> 12:05.045
$0.25 an hour. And I did my full 12 hours every week 
beginning, I believe, the second semester of my

12:05.065 --> 12:13.674
freshman year. I just was too consumed that first 
semester. And you did everything. shovel horse

12:19.645 --> 12:29.617
manure off the streets to cutting brush to tending 
lawns, just whatever had to be done. There was a

12:29.877 --> 12:34.283
student labor force that did a lot of the 
maintenance. Now, some of the more fortunate

12:34.303 --> 12:37.947
guys, I thought, were those that did janitor's 
work. They were hard to come by, those jobs that did

12:37.987 --> 12:42.312
the dormitories. And even the cleaner job was to be 
a waiter in the mess hall. But I worked until my

12:49.210 --> 12:51.213
senior year. I thought, I'm maybe getting ahead of 
the story, but I thought I was going to be editor of

12:53.576 --> 12:59.525
the Longhorn, we called it then. A yearbook. I had 
been elected editor. And I was best paying job in

13:04.332 --> 13:06.014
school. But I was also appointed cadet colonel. 
And in that year, the administration had made some

13:10.000 --> 13:17.631
regulations that said that any student could 
accumulate only so many student activity points.

13:23.430 --> 13:26.953
Have you been aware of this? No. And the maximum 
number were 10.

13:32.197 --> 13:44.748
If you were a member of one of the recognized 
academic clubs that corresponded to your major,

13:32.197 --> 13:44.748
for example, I believe that was two points. If you 
were an officer in it, it was five points. And so you

13:48.728 --> 13:53.495
can see that after a while, you can accumulate 10 
points. I was very active in a number of activities

13:54.918 --> 14:02.309
down there. But when I was appointed cadet 
colonel, that's 10 points. Editor of the

14:08.959 --> 14:10.942
yearbooks, 10 points. Each one of them is the 
maximum. So I had to resign.

14:19.998 --> 14:22.642
as editor of the yearbook. It was my choice. And it 
was a proper choice. You would have rather been the

14:26.929 --> 14:29.272
colonel than the editor. I felt that was, as badly 
as I needed the money and as much as I had worked for

14:29.292 --> 14:45.256
that other job, I'd say I'd worked on it for two 
years before the yearbook, I still felt being

14:29.292 --> 14:45.256
leader of that cadet corps was clearly the choice. 
Why?

14:49.563 --> 14:59.016
When all was said and done, I said that my

14:49.563 --> 14:59.016
main objective was to get a good education. But 
actually, I was a part of that bunch of men. And

15:04.724 --> 15:17.882
whether it's, as we were talking this morning, 
whether it's a university or an army unit, it's not

15:04.724 --> 15:17.882
the plant or the facilities or the weapons. It's 
the people that count. And so I wanted to, I thought

15:22.872 --> 15:26.356
I was very fortunate. I couldn't figure out how in 
the world I was chosen in the first place. And I

15:29.020 --> 15:31.403
still don't know. But there was no question. I 
wanted to be the cadet colonel. I never

15:36.630 --> 15:39.234
contemplated being it, really. Even though I was 
Sergeant Major the year before, I just couldn't

15:39.254 --> 15:41.937
see. I mean, I guess I wasn't confident enough. I 
wasn't counting on it happening, in other words.

15:50.077 --> 15:51.239
Tell me how it came about. Well, as I say, I'm not 
certain how they choose the cadet colonel. The

16:03.296 --> 16:17.316
military department makes most of the 
determination, I'm sure, but of course the

16:03.296 --> 16:17.316
president of the university always, at least in 
those days,

16:03.296 --> 16:17.316
he could approve or disapprove. But they looked 
for someone whose academic standing was very

16:19.152 --> 16:26.323
important.

16:27.545 --> 16:38.883
Activities and extracurricular

16:27.545 --> 16:38.883
activities and positions in them was important. 
Obviously, the military aptitudes and standing

16:45.713 --> 16:51.258
academically in military subjects, was very 
important. I had been chosen the year before as the

16:53.781 --> 17:00.587
Corps

16:53.781 --> 17:00.587
Sergeant Major. In other words, I was the senior 
non-commissioned officer in the Corps under

17:00.607 --> 17:12.919
Cadet Colonel Woody Varner, whom you may know of, 
later became President and Chancellor of the

17:00.607 --> 17:12.919
University of Nebraska. And I'm sure he had a lot to 
do with it. That is, his recommendation was

17:20.306 --> 17:22.207
considered. And anyway. So you had a position of 
leadership. Yes. In the Corps, no question about

17:31.076 --> 17:34.779
that. I never got to command the Corps in the Army, 
but I did command the Corps at A&M.

17:42.546 --> 17:44.188
And as far as you were concerned, It was much more 
important to have this position dealing with

17:45.434 --> 17:50.239
people than have one making money. Yes, and I took 
care of the money thing. I could take you here down

17:58.387 --> 18:07.395
to camp and meet the president of the First 
National Bank, and he must be 75. He was, of course,

18:07.415 --> 18:12.100
a young man then. He's probably in his early 70s. 
But anyway, he staked me. I borrowed money from

18:19.111 --> 18:24.757
that bank, and I did each year a little bit, but he 
had to carry me that last year. Dad always helped,

18:25.157 --> 18:28.761
but I figured I had to do at least half of it. I was 
working two summers. I worked

18:32.665 --> 18:38.791
what was then a good job. Doing what? $100 a month.

18:43.596 --> 18:44.837
I had a crew. of me and one other fella going all over 
this county for the Agricultural Stabilization

18:46.488 --> 18:58.224
Office measuring croplands. You know, in those 
days they had controls on how much cotton. Sure. So

19:02.570 --> 19:03.110
forth. And we measured it by chains in those days. 
This is like the summer of 38 and 39? Yeah. And I got

19:11.441 --> 19:15.567
to mow, I got all over this county, and I got to mow 
people. Farmers living on the farm, landowners

19:17.892 --> 19:20.615
living in town. And that was a very fun experience, 
I might add. No kidding. And $100 a month. That was

19:26.001 --> 19:28.384
big pay. How'd you get that job? I think the 
director of that program was a good Aggie. I think

19:37.234 --> 19:38.496
that probably. But my dad probably helped.

19:44.903 --> 19:47.646
I was going to add a moment ago. On this selection of 
the cadet colonel, I should have mentioned,

19:49.381 --> 19:53.105
because it's very important. You know, at the end 
of your junior year, you go off to ROTC camp. And

19:57.771 --> 20:04.638
that's really where the final tests are, whether 
they're consciously tested or not. That's where

20:04.759 --> 20:07.642
the final test is. Because then you get an 
opportunity for practical leadership of your

20:07.662 --> 20:17.593
peers as you're organized for various phases of 
that camp work. And you get the opportunity.

20:19.537 --> 20:24.042
demonstrate that you have learned what they've 
been teaching in the military science courses.

20:24.943 --> 20:26.565
Well, did you go or did you not? Oh, yes. See, I went 
to my senior year before being, I mean my junior

20:27.846 --> 20:40.580
year before being selected for, appointed cadet 
colonel my senior

20:27.846 --> 20:40.580
year. But when I got out of A&M, I owed something 
less than a thousand dollars. And that looked like

20:49.709 --> 20:52.773
a mountain of debt to me. My pay as a new second 
lieutenant on active duty was $125 a month. And I

21:02.185 --> 21:12.157
paid that back on a lieutenant's pay the first two 
years I was out. In those days, it cost about $500 to

21:12.177 --> 21:16.543
go to A&M

21:20.354 --> 21:21.095
Direct cost. For living, all expenses.

21:27.645 --> 21:33.755
Were the farmers resentful in this area toward the 
controls and the Roosevelt administration? They

21:33.795 --> 21:34.135
were. And

21:34.175 --> 21:43.770
that may have influenced my opinion a moment ago, 
that I think farmers would just like to be free of

21:34.175 --> 21:43.770
all this. They'd be willing to be free of subsidies 
if they could be free of controls. and

21:48.940 --> 21:56.507
regulations, and

21:48.940 --> 21:56.507
some of these controls were indirect, I guess. Oh, 
I had one farmer. We had some interesting

22:01.792 --> 22:03.013
experience. Some of them were very resentful of 
it, in fact, angry about it. Most of them accepted

22:06.737 --> 22:07.898
it. And most of the people, even though I might be in 
the far corner of the county, they probably knew my

22:09.680 --> 22:17.547
dad, so that kind of helped, you know. But I 
remember right in this community,

22:18.522 --> 22:27.590
one farmer sent me word not to show up to measure his 
land. And if I did, he'd be waiting with a shotgun.

22:32.635 --> 22:32.935
Really? Did you go do it? I had to. And he just 
bluffed. We had no problem. But he scared the hell

22:40.202 --> 22:41.503
out of me. I bet you. That's how extreme it was. Some 
of them were that extremely bitter about it. Tell

22:48.138 --> 22:52.923
me about hazing at A&M.

22:52.943 --> 23:01.011
Hazing at A&M was accepted,

22:52.943 --> 23:01.011
basically, when I entered A&M.

23:04.254 --> 23:13.944
My observation of it over four years was that 
hazing left something to be desired. The outfit I

23:13.964 --> 23:16.947
was in, I never saw it. I mean, you know, it hurts to 
be paddled with a board the way they did, but I never

23:19.306 --> 23:40.366
saw it done as just pure retribution. And I never 
saw it done in anger.

23:45.731 --> 23:48.233
And the only time I ever saw it overdone in my 
opinion, in my outfit, was that the,

23:48.770 --> 24:04.166
what we call the, I think what we used to call it was 
pinning on the stripes.

24:08.150 --> 24:13.556
A&M, after the first few weeks, they'd publish a 
list of appointments. The leaders were appointed

24:15.238 --> 24:18.321
early. the cadet commanders and first sergeants. 
And then they fleshed that out after we all got down

24:22.382 --> 24:26.688
there. I guess one reason was because they weren't 
sure who was going to show up. So then each outfit,

24:31.736 --> 24:38.786
at least mine did, had a formation which if I, as a 
sophomore, got promoted to corporal, I got two

24:31.736 --> 24:38.786
stripes. So each upperclassman had the privilege 
of pinning those stripes on. That was two licks for

24:45.136 --> 24:46.738
the board. Some of them, realizing how many licks 
you're going to get, were very, very soft with

24:47.798 --> 24:55.486
them. But others who had a special relationship 
with you one way or another would let you have it.

25:01.913 --> 25:12.765
But I say that was overdone simply because of the 
numbers involved, not still those elements that I

25:01.913 --> 25:12.765
mentioned that would make it really 
insupportable. It just didn't exist. I probably

25:16.705 --> 25:26.679
shouldn't comment beyond that, because I had 
never witnessed

25:16.705 --> 25:26.679
the hazing in other outfits. But I think the board 
was misused in some outfits. Now, this was a

25:30.204 --> 25:33.048
function, again, of leadership. And we had 
commanders in that battery that I was in that just

25:33.148 --> 25:44.704
saw that it was never abused.

25:46.962 --> 25:59.257
The controls on the sophomores, because they were 
freshly removed from being freshmen, were almost

25:46.962 --> 25:59.257
as strict as they were on the freshmen because they 
didn't want them to abuse hazing. Now, I've just

25:59.277 --> 26:04.183
spoken of the physical hazing, or the board 
hazing. There were other aspects of physical

26:04.223 --> 26:13.774
hazing, and there was some mental hazing, but the 
mental hazing I never thought really was

26:04.223 --> 26:13.774
objectionable. It was just part of the program. 
Now, I might comment that having gone back to A&M in

26:19.094 --> 26:35.169
1946 for three years on the staff,

26:19.094 --> 26:35.169
I think the mental hazing and probably the 
physical hazing were even worse, although the

26:19.094 --> 26:35.169
board was less used.

26:39.173 --> 26:43.217
Did you think that hazing was a good idea or a bad 
idea? If I were inventing it, I would not have put it

26:43.257 --> 26:45.859
in there. But this built up over a number of years of 
tradition, and I'm sure I've seen it because I was

26:47.729 --> 26:58.883
there as a student and later as a member of the 
military staff. It's had its phases and it's had

26:58.943 --> 27:05.871
its... What was the purpose, as far as you were 
concerned as a student? First of all, the purpose

27:06.452 --> 27:17.145
of hazing, as I would assess it, and would still be, 
is to subordinate the... the private. You've got

27:20.423 --> 27:23.206
to do that somehow. And you're not in ranks that 
often or that long. You're in all ranks often. But

27:28.553 --> 27:38.706
you don't have enough time to train as a military 
unit to accomplish this, devoting all day in

27:28.553 --> 27:38.706
uniform and formations. So that's the first 
purpose. Somehow, at the time I went to A&M,

27:49.542 --> 27:53.667
They made you very much aware at the time you got 
there that there were no boys at A&M. I don't know

27:53.687 --> 27:58.133
whether you heard that expression or not. Anybody 
enrolled in that cadet corps is a man.

28:05.603 --> 28:13.213
And so, in some way, this was designed to make

28:05.603 --> 28:13.213
a man, I guess. Quickly. Yeah. And prove to those 
newcomers that they could be men. not

28:20.542 --> 28:37.583
just at A&M, but at A&M, too, you'd hear the 
expression, or somehow that you can take it aspect

28:20.542 --> 28:37.583
was attached to Hazen. And I really don't know. In 
some organizations, I think it was a matter of

28:40.187 --> 28:46.134
punishment, too, but I don't think that that was 
the primary. I think that had come fourth in this

28:46.775 --> 28:49.418
line of four. As I knew it. I think it may have 
shifted some emphasis, but of course, when I was

28:54.005 --> 29:01.332
back on the staff, I wasn't really that close to it. 
You couldn't get, as a staff member, you don't get

29:01.352 --> 29:04.255
that close to it. What did you like about the Corps? 
Well, the main thing I liked about the Corps is that

29:09.560 --> 29:18.088
I felt a part of something defined.

29:20.701 --> 29:23.143
I had a defined part in it.

29:29.449 --> 29:40.040
I think I was conscious of the fact that I didn't 
know where all those boys came from, but I knew I

29:29.449 --> 29:40.040
came, I'm a country boy.

29:42.782 --> 29:48.548
But that sort of equalized us at Cadet Corps, 
because we were all there on the same basis. We all

29:49.793 --> 29:50.955
dressed alike. We all did the same thing except in 
our classrooms and when we went home. So it didn't

29:58.086 --> 30:00.771
make any difference if you were wealthy or poor? It 
didn't matter whether you were wealthy or poor. It

30:02.573 --> 30:15.634
didn't matter whether you were a member of the 
Houston Country Club or had your recreation,

30:02.573 --> 30:15.634
hunting and fishing, as I did largely.

30:15.935 --> 30:17.337
It just was a great equalizer. And of course, that 
meant that

30:18.143 --> 30:27.993
we all had the same responsibility and same 
opportunity at each level.

30:30.916 --> 30:43.829
And of course,

30:30.916 --> 30:43.829
I never really thought of these terms, but I 
probably wouldn't have been a cadet colonel if it

30:30.916 --> 30:43.829
weren't that way. I mean, you know, if there were 
any gradations of who you are because of where you

30:48.046 --> 30:50.229
came from. It

30:50.249 --> 30:58.462
was a great thing, and a great spirit there. That 
was another thing you liked? Oh, tremendous, you

31:00.165 --> 31:01.988
bet. I liked the spirit.

31:06.214 --> 31:15.268
That old Aggie spirit, it doesn't take long for you 
to get it, and it becomes more and more ingrained,

31:06.214 --> 31:15.268
and the old all for one, one for all means 
something. I have been, of

31:17.830 --> 31:26.719
course, in my military career over much of the 
world. Well, certainly not all of it, but

31:27.660 --> 31:42.536
only one place was I ever stationed in my thirty 
years of service where I didn't have at least one

31:27.660 --> 31:42.536
other Aggie to have a muster with on April 21st. No 
kidding. Where was that? And we always had them.

31:48.695 --> 31:49.857
That was in Yugoslavia. I was . And there weren't 
too many Aggies there. No. But if I can digress a

31:55.844 --> 32:01.552
minute, Fran, of course, was very my wife.

32:04.636 --> 32:07.359
And by the way, we haven't gotten into our kids and 
things yet. But I'd like to talk about them some

32:07.620 --> 32:13.687
when the opportunity's proper. But Fran, you 
know, was brought up down there. Her dad was a

32:17.045 --> 32:22.232
graduate of A&M on staff down there. He was in the 
experiment station.

32:27.740 --> 32:30.343
But anyway, we both felt very oriented toward A&M. 
And on that occasion in Yugoslavia, she and I were

32:30.423 --> 32:40.698
consciously observing the occasion. And seated 
in our home there in Belgrade, and the phone rang.

32:48.685 --> 33:04.864
And it was Colonel Chester Schaefer of the class of 
33, Army,

32:48.685 --> 33:04.864
and Major George, Lieutenant Colonel I guess he 
was at that time, George Cooper, class of 42, that

32:48.685 --> 33:04.864
I'd gone through the war with and was a great 
friend. And Chester Schaefer and I for years,

33:04.904 --> 33:11.151
we didn't write, but we'd call each other. And 
somehow we got into the contest of When I'd place

33:15.652 --> 33:22.298
the call, I'd try to hook him into accepting a 
collect call and vice versa. But we had a long

33:24.481 --> 33:25.962
conversation. We'd succeeded in that case. I 
didn't feel that if I'd accepted this guy's call

33:27.604 --> 33:35.031
from Schaefer and found out he was there, I felt 
defeated. But we had a long conversation from

33:36.933 --> 33:42.638
Frankfurt, Germany to Belgrade.

33:42.972 --> 33:51.722
after we'd said about all there was to be said, I 
started sort of signing off, and Chester said,

33:42.972 --> 33:51.722
well, now, Becker, don't hang up on me. He said, 
you're paying for this call, don't you know? And I

33:56.087 --> 34:00.512
said, Chester, don't you know that nobody can 
reverse charges into Yugoslavia? Which they

34:02.074 --> 34:03.355
couldn't do. So he had to pay for that call, after 
all. He thought I was paying for it. But... That A&M

34:12.419 --> 34:14.761
spirit stays with you forever? It does. I don't 
know. I've never found...

34:18.124 --> 34:25.591
Well, the West Point Society meets wherever they 
are, their people, each year. Never anything like

34:27.292 --> 34:31.596
this A&M must have. They don't have the spirit that 
A&M does. Well, they don't have the ceremony to it.

34:38.142 --> 34:39.383
What about just the spirit? Do they have the 
spirit? I don't think so. I don't think it's the

34:42.372 --> 34:43.513
same. I think they have a fine spirit at West Point, 
but I don't think, this may be precious, but I don't

34:43.713 --> 34:51.342
think it matches the A&M's. I don't know what the 
A&M student body's status of spirit is now,

34:51.362 --> 34:57.228
frankly. I don't really know. Were there, of 
course, those are some of the things that you liked

34:59.410 --> 35:03.254
about the Corps. Were there some things that you 
disliked about the Corps when you were there?

35:08.580 --> 35:08.880
Anything? I can't think of a thing that I disliked 
about the Cadet Corps. Nothing. At any year. Now,

35:16.771 --> 35:18.553
don't get me wrong. There were times when I just 
didn't like it worth a bit that we fish were called

35:19.734 --> 35:31.007
out to drill an extra hour in the day. I could 
recognize when we first got there we had to have

35:32.748 --> 35:37.493
training to be able to march properly. But there 
were times when I thought it was excessive. I mean,

35:41.367 --> 35:53.265
you know, things of that sort, but as far as the 
Corps and what it stood for and what it did and how it

35:41.367 --> 35:53.265
was organized and operated, I thought it was 
nothing but right. And I, uh, we'll get into the

35:55.748 --> 36:08.227
downgrading of the Corps later, but at that time I 
think it was right. Okay. Now, you became a

36:10.848 --> 36:12.170
general. In which way do you think that the Corps 
helped your advancement

36:12.410 --> 36:20.281
in the military? Well, I think the Cadet Corps at 
A&M is a very serious, was a very serious military

36:20.381 --> 36:27.330
organization. And to the extent of our capacity as 
young cadets, we didn't know we were copying the

36:27.350 --> 36:39.066
Army, but our mentors there had us aim just in the 
same direction.

36:41.763 --> 36:48.309
So it was a little miniature Army organization.

36:48.329 --> 36:56.576
After I left A&M, I came to learn that a lot of our 
yells that we'd do at football games really

36:48.329 --> 36:56.576
originated at West Point. And I'm sure military 
instruction over the years brought them in there.

37:02.982 --> 37:10.909
But the main thing that the Cadet Corps helps 
anybody who chooses a military career, and I don't

37:02.982 --> 37:10.909
think it's essential, obviously, because 
they're successful officers who never went to an

37:11.395 --> 37:41.352
ROTC school but the main thing is that it gives you 
that succession of experiences

37:11.395 --> 37:41.352
that add up to cumulative leadership abilities 
for example in those days when you entered A&M as a

37:11.395 --> 37:41.352
freshman you were a private In the field artillery 
training, in the marching formation, you were in

37:42.884 --> 37:53.975
the position of a private, corresponding to what 
it was in the Army. When you were a sophomore, if you

37:55.277 --> 38:01.163
were measured up, you were a corporal and you were 
in charge of a few people. During those times, you

38:01.183 --> 38:08.250
were either in military formation or in military 
instruction, practical instruction. Junior,

38:09.057 --> 38:11.801
you were a sergeant, and that in large. You became a 
platoon sergeant or section chief. And then, of

38:15.585 --> 38:37.073
course, as an officer, if you were fortunate 
enough to be selected as a battery company and

38:15.585 --> 38:37.073
troop commander

38:15.585 --> 38:37.073
or a battalion commander or a regimental 
commander or the corps commander, you

38:15.585 --> 38:37.073
accumulated in that senior year a great deal of 
practical experiences in leading others,

38:15.585 --> 38:37.073
directing and leading others. Discipline was 
good in the cadet corps at A&M when I was there.

38:43.850 --> 38:44.791
Excellent, I would say. But still,

38:46.333 --> 38:51.558
running an outfit wasn't automatic. That company 
commander or that battalion commander or

38:52.219 --> 39:01.129
regimental commander and so forth, they had to 
lead. And they did. And they did their very best.

39:05.654 --> 39:08.697
And most of them who were selected for those jobs 
did well. because they were selected well.

39:14.345 --> 39:33.756
So it's just a miniature

39:14.345 --> 39:33.756
range of experience that you then go into the Army 
and match as you go up, except with greater

39:14.345 --> 39:33.756
responsibilities and greater knowledge 
required and greater preparation required to do

39:14.345 --> 39:33.756
the military things. Do you think that there was 
anything in the Corps that in any way hindered your

39:37.111 --> 39:42.997
ability to become successful in the military? 
Held you back? I can't think of a thing. Never

39:47.582 --> 39:48.663
considered a thing.

39:51.847 --> 39:52.888
I think it was all plus. I

39:54.389 --> 40:02.578
think being in the Corps hindered to some extent

40:07.722 --> 40:10.166
the academic side, but not very seriously. 
Because the nature of our young people is such that

40:11.729 --> 40:22.649
if they hadn't had those extra military things to 
do, they'd probably been goofing off anyway

40:11.729 --> 40:22.649
instead of studying. And we had more directed 
study time as freshmen and sophomores than most

40:23.731 --> 40:32.346
free students were put to it anyway. Now, you were a 
leader in the Corps, and then you became a leader in

40:33.085 --> 40:37.992
the military. Did the fact that you were in the 
Corps have an impact on developing that role of

40:39.134 --> 40:45.904
leadership? Well, I'm sure it did for the basic 
reason I state, and that is that I got experience in

40:48.047 --> 40:53.576
leadership there. Right. I don't think the—and, 
of course, in those days, we were trained to— have

41:04.372 --> 41:08.457
knowledge in a particular branch of the Army, 
which you don't do anymore. That was helpful too,

41:09.298 --> 41:10.740
very helpful. As a matter of fact, when we were 
ordered to active duty, my first job was with a

41:10.800 --> 41:20.151
battery of artillery. That's the proper level to 
start your experience. And I'm

41:23.996 --> 41:33.147
not suggesting that we were superior at all to the 
West Point graduate, but the West Point graduate

41:34.021 --> 41:47.561
that was in that outfit with me had had a non-branch 
material, a branch in material training with

41:34.021 --> 41:47.561
three months of service school. And that three 
months just didn't catch him up to where A&M

41:48.983 --> 41:58.577
graduates were in their branch knowledge and 
capabilities. So really, We started out an

42:01.510 --> 42:18.125
advantage to those other counterparts that 
didn't have ROTC and full military

42:01.510 --> 42:18.125
training as in the military schools like A&M and 
BMI and so forth. Were some of the professional

42:18.145 --> 42:26.753
soldiers at A&M at that time, were those 
professionals, did they have an impact on you? Oh,

42:28.415 --> 42:28.935
yes. I think the officers, of course, had a great 
deal more because we were more direct contact with

42:29.472 --> 42:34.540
the officers. We had some fine non-coms there. 
Were there any that you were particularly close

42:40.709 --> 42:43.033
to? Well, I was close to Sergeant Thomas, I 
remember. A few. Now, I became Sergeant Thomas in—

42:57.856 --> 43:00.699
other sergeant, but I came close to both of them in 
the same way. I was a member of the A&M pistol team,

43:00.839 --> 43:07.266
and at one time Thomas was our coach and this other 
sergeant, I can't call his name. Later, Captain

43:08.688 --> 43:12.832
Inslow was our officer supervisor. 
Incidentally, you've heard a lot about A&M's

43:12.852 --> 43:21.942
national football championship team, but we had 
the national championship in pistol. Really?

43:23.263 --> 43:24.405
When I was there. No kidding. Very, very fine 
pistol team. competed with all the other ROTC

43:27.792 --> 43:32.779
schools that were willing to compete.

43:36.324 --> 43:42.072
Anyway, that's how I became very close to those two 
particular sergeants. Then, of course, in the

43:42.352 --> 43:48.320
course of the year, we'd get to know these non-con 
pretty well because we'd be training with them.

43:48.340 --> 43:54.629
They'd be our instructors at the low level, you 
know, on the practical level. We had some that had

43:54.649 --> 43:56.752
been there a long, long time. They liked ANU. by and 
large. In those days, you know, if you enlisted for

44:01.721 --> 44:08.610
a position and did it well, you could stay there. 
Right. At the same rank. In the 1930s. That's

44:13.617 --> 44:14.578
right.

44:17.783 --> 44:22.569
What do you think was the quality of officers that 
were graduated from A&M? Let's talk about that.

44:24.772 --> 44:29.018
Did you think that those young second lieutenants 
who were A&M grads were top notch or mediocre or

44:29.909 --> 44:32.371
average? Were they well trained? I think that on 
the whole they were absolutely outstanding

44:34.714 --> 44:46.565
as a category of input to the officer corps. By that 
I mean as a source. And this was not just my

44:51.250 --> 44:58.617
judgment, but I say that for example in World War 
II. I was in the 1st Cavalry Division, went through

44:59.525 --> 45:04.452
the whole war with it. We had a number of A&M men in 
the division when we went overseas,

45:06.034 --> 45:14.465
a lot of A&M officers. But

45:16.027 --> 45:25.921
that was, you know, we stayed in the outfit until we 
got somebody got hurt or sick or whatnot. None of

45:26.501 --> 45:27.743
this rotation. But we did lose officers through 
casualties or promotion or transfers, and

45:28.887 --> 45:49.009
my senior officers would seek the A&M officer, and 
I've heard them say, more than one of them, I'll

45:28.887 --> 45:49.009
take an A&M officer sight unseen. He doesn't even 
need to see his record. Really? I heard that more

45:53.814 --> 45:58.759
than once, both in Vietnam and World War II. From 
officers who were not Aggies? Who were not Aggies.

46:06.311 --> 46:06.711
That is. I've heard that from West Pointers. 
Really? Yes.

46:17.406 --> 46:20.250
So that's the kind of reputation they had. And 
that's quite a reputation they left too. That sure

46:24.196 --> 46:24.797
is. We had a number of I was in Vietnam a year and a 
half with the 1st Cavalry Division again, and we

46:28.810 --> 46:36.321
had a number of A&M graduate officers in there. And 
they did well, but of course they were, under the

46:37.823 --> 46:49.621
new program, they were not branch trained, but 
they had that cadet corps training. And they had

46:49.741 --> 46:52.245
that spirit and so forth. And they knew about that 
reputation too. And even the A&M graduates in the

46:57.346 --> 47:01.172
60s were attempting to uphold that tradition. You 
bet.

47:04.498 --> 47:13.313
Let's compare the young man who was just 
commissioned from West Point as second

47:04.498 --> 47:13.313
lieutenant versus the young man from A&M. How 
would you compare their traditions?
