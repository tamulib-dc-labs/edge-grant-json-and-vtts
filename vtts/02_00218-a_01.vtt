WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:06.991
And we're in the office of Bill Yunkin here in 
Bryan. Now we're going to stop and hope that the

00:08.293 --> 00:11.678
machine is working.

00:14.382 --> 00:20.630
A while ago, didn't get the date, March 24, in the 
office of Bill Yunkin. And we're going to chat

00:22.112 --> 00:31.185
about what it was like to be a student at A&M back a 
few years. Why did you attend A&M? Well, my basic

00:34.282 --> 00:48.200
impetus for attending A&M came from, as I guess it 
does for most folks, from influences in your life,

00:34.282 --> 00:48.200
from people in your home town area. None of my 
family had ever gone to college. My father, World

00:53.808 --> 01:01.358
War II, at that age, would be in college and came 
back. I was, I guess, what you call the first of the

01:01.912 --> 01:08.340
baby boomers. My dad got out of the service in 1946, 
and nine months later, in January 1947, there I am.

01:15.770 --> 01:27.325
So

01:15.770 --> 01:27.325
they didn't have that educational influence on 
me, although they would have liked to have gone to

01:15.770 --> 01:27.325
college. It really came about while I was growing 
up in the, a school system there in Gilmer where I

01:31.426 --> 01:34.411
was born.

01:37.195 --> 01:48.373
We had a lot of

01:37.195 --> 01:48.373
people who were community leaders in the town that 
were A&M graduates. Gilmer is an Aggie town. And

01:51.598 --> 01:57.788
the reason it's an Aggie town kind of goes back to 
one particular person.

01:59.017 --> 02:04.543
Everybody talks about 12th Man Superior, E. King 
Gill coming out of the stands, et cetera, et

01:59.017 --> 02:04.543
cetera. Well, on the field that day was a young man 
who was playing center and middle linebacker for

02:05.383 --> 02:11.049
the Aggies. His name was Henry McCullough. What's 
Henry McCullough? M-C-C-U-L-L-O-U-G-H. And Mr.

02:17.215 --> 02:29.007
Henry, as he was known to generations of kids 
growing up in Gilmer, after he graduated from A&M,

02:17.215 --> 02:29.007
came home to college school and coached Bob. And he 
has gone through about three generations now that

02:29.662 --> 02:38.995
are direct influences of Mr. Henry's recruitment 
process. When I was in high school, he'd already

02:40.376 --> 02:43.641
retired. He'd been principal, superintendent, 
etc. He was just teaching chemistry and

02:47.466 --> 02:53.995
analytical geometry and some of the other math 
courses. I had him for that.

02:58.602 --> 03:08.078
What he would do is he would talk about his days 
staying home and playing for DX Bible and all those

02:58.602 --> 03:08.078
memories and things.

03:10.001 --> 03:14.629
And it got you interested in the school. And he was a 
person of tremendous respect in our community.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.243
The leading citizens of the community, other than 
their parents, because one person they truly

03:23.560 --> 03:30.127
respected, admired, and revered would be Mr. 
Henry. And so when Mr. Henry ever came up to you and

03:30.147 --> 03:39.218
put his arm around you and said, Bill, you ever 
thought about going to A&M? You knew you'd kind of

03:39.238 --> 03:45.425
pass muster in his eyes for the quality of person 
that he thought should be going to his university.

03:46.987 --> 03:52.673
And there were other people there, too, in the 
community that were former students. that had an

03:53.463 --> 03:54.785
influence. And one of the other aspects too is I did 
get an opportunity to come down here early on in my

03:55.626 --> 04:09.842
life, like my early teenage years, because I was 
involved in 4-H and FFA. I was a farm boy. I was from a

04:12.245 --> 04:14.047
farming family. And I lived in Gilmore. I lived 10 
miles from Gilmore. That's what actually it was.

04:20.815 --> 04:23.318
And because of that interest, and help with my 
county agent, Mr. John Henry, who is retired and

04:23.399 --> 04:33.289
lives here in Collin Stochendam. Mr. Grover 
Bishop, who's my ag teacher, is deceased now. But

04:36.392 --> 04:46.542
those men bringing me down here for judging 
contests and leadership camp and things of this

04:36.392 --> 04:46.542
nature. I got to see the campus and stuff like that. 
And through that interest, It led to me obtaining a

04:52.019 --> 04:59.709
scholarship to attend Texas A&M and to major in 
agriculture. How much was that scholarship? It

05:01.451 --> 05:20.136
was the grand total of $1,000, and it paid like $125 
a semester, which was starting off about a third of

05:01.451 --> 05:20.136
what it cost me to go to school each semester. So 
with that scholarship and what I saved from my

05:21.230 --> 05:36.646
working in animal projects and things of this 
nature, I was able to go all the way through UNM

05:21.230 --> 05:36.646
without ever having to borrow any money until my 
last semester, my second year. Describe how you

05:36.666 --> 05:42.372
came and what you brought when you came to enroll 
the first time. How did you get here and what did you

05:42.492 --> 05:44.935
bring and who brought you? Well, after I won my 
scholarship, I had to come and go through the

05:51.740 --> 05:55.904
summer pre-enrollment process. And at that 
particular point in time, there was so much going

05:57.565 --> 06:09.336
on at home on the farm and stuff that the family just 
could not come with me. And so I had to come on my own.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.683
And they took me to Tyler, and I caught the 
Greyhound bus at Tyler. And I rode that bus darn

06:18.904 --> 06:21.747
near all day long until it finally dropped me off at 
the East Gate of the campus.

06:32.671 --> 06:34.753
This would be September or August? No, this would 
be like in July. Of what year? Of 1965. This was the

06:41.321 --> 06:49.270
pre-enrollment deal where you'd come down and 
sign up for whatever courses you're going to take

06:41.321 --> 06:49.270
and all that good stuff. The same thing kids do now, 
but I don't think it's changed that much. But

06:56.107 --> 06:57.530
anyway, I came down for that. It was interesting.

07:02.197 --> 07:07.826
Riding that bus, you kind of become familiar with 
those who were on that bus with you between the

07:02.197 --> 07:07.826
stops. I eventually found that there were two 
other kids. One was a guy named George Strong who

07:13.575 --> 07:16.540
was coming in from A little town up above with 
Amarillo.

07:24.356 --> 07:27.299
It's the last little town, basically, if you get to 
before you get to New Mexico. Dumas. Dumas. From

07:29.922 --> 07:33.647
Dumas and a guy named Skip. Gosh, Skip's name. From 
Dallas. And we stopped in Bremont, Texas. It was

07:40.675 --> 07:42.837
one of the stops. And there was... And this 
reminded me of the... Little paintings you see

07:48.953 --> 07:54.180
from Saturday Evening Post covers, you know. Here 
was this little farming family in their little

07:54.200 --> 08:12.945
pickup truck with all their kids and mom and dad are 
there and here's his son waiting and the bus pulls

07:54.200 --> 08:12.945
up and he hugs his mom and shakes his dad's hand and 
he gets on and all he had was, he didn't have a

07:54.200 --> 08:12.945
suitcase, I had a little bag. He had a brown paper 
sack that he had his stuff in and... He was going to

08:19.126 --> 08:24.952
Texas A&M because he graduated from Bremont High 
School's salutatorians. So he had a scholarship

08:24.972 --> 08:29.276
to go to a state-supported institution. So he was 
coming down to become a mechanical engineer. I

08:33.641 --> 08:39.106
don't think he ever had trigonometry, physics, 
calculus, or any of those things that you would

08:33.641 --> 08:39.106
need. But all of us, the four of us, got off that bus. 
And I remember right there as we were going down to

08:44.332 --> 08:48.576
the systems building, we walked. from there over 
to the other side of the campus where they put us in

08:49.484 --> 08:54.228
the dorms. And I remember the systems building 
being so imposing at the end of that street. And we

08:58.392 --> 09:00.314
thought, golly, boys, we're here. This is the big 
town. And three of us were basically country boys.

09:04.617 --> 09:05.898
One was city boy. But all of us were basically the 
same background from working families. And we all

09:11.603 --> 09:17.989
had received a scholarship of some form or fashion 
to attend it. And we all ended up being on the

09:18.982 --> 09:30.197
work-study program, which was provided by the 
university to help kids who needed to have a little

09:18.982 --> 09:30.197
financial assistance. And I know that Deward

09:30.217 --> 09:43.676
and Skip, I don't know what they ended up doing, but 
John Turlock, the boy from Bremont and I, in the

09:30.217 --> 09:43.676
wedding tables of Duncan Knight on our freshman 
year. And all four graduated. John got his

09:48.074 --> 09:52.980
mechanical engineering degree and was a 
successful engineer. I kind of lost touch with

09:53.060 --> 10:01.790
Dewitt and Skip, but everybody graduating I think 
went on to other things. But that was my first

10:01.810 --> 10:06.175
experience and that's what I brought with me was 
that. And I basically just, if someone back in

10:06.535 --> 10:17.187
those days they thought of the typical, I guess I 
was, small town country boy kind of environment. a

10:17.960 --> 10:20.083
lot of what you found on campus. Describe the 
campus physically. What buildings were where?

10:25.251 --> 10:27.013
What did the campus seem like then? Oh, it seemed 
huge to me. But it really wasn't. There were about

10:33.964 --> 10:38.050
8,500 students that were enrolled in 1965. It was 
the first year that the Corps was non-compulsory.

10:44.719 --> 10:46.482
It was also the first year that The university was 
open to admission to women.

10:53.510 --> 10:58.936
But the university itself had not changed very, 
very much at all. We did have the MSC. There was not

11:02.621 --> 11:06.465
the Rudder Tower or any of that other stuff. It was 
Guy Hall. The building was there. And we didn't

11:11.691 --> 11:15.355
have, all we had was the old library. We didn't have 
the new one. Didn't have so many of the buildings

11:23.139 --> 11:27.544
that are there on campus that people are so 
familiar with. There are a lot more open spaces on

11:27.564 --> 11:30.328
campus than there are now. But it still was to my 
view a huge place and I was apprehensive to say the

11:31.289 --> 11:40.341
least. How describe life as a fish when you were a 
freshman? You know, when I came in, I

11:47.870 --> 11:59.467
didn't know much about all this stuff. I had a 
scholarship, and I was going to A&M. And I knew

12:02.331 --> 12:04.334
there was this thing called a COR. All I knew about 
it was spelled funny. And I thought it should be

12:06.116 --> 12:09.061
C-O-R-E instead of C-O-R-P. I thought that was 
CORP, not COR. That's how ignorant I was. And when

12:12.986 --> 12:16.932
we're going through this registration deal, had 
you in these lines, and you don't know why you're in

12:17.485 --> 12:22.232
the line, but you get to the front of the line. And 
the guy asked me, Army or Air Force? And I remember

12:25.357 --> 12:31.045
being so intimidated and everything else, but I 
did have enough sense at least to ask one question.

12:31.305 --> 12:33.328
I said, well, what's the difference? He said, 
well, to graduate in the Air Force, it's a

12:33.348 --> 12:37.374
five-year commitment. If it's the Army, it's a 
two-year commitment. I said, put me in the Army. So

12:41.680 --> 12:46.227
that's how I ended up in the Army ROTC part of it. 
They asked me about, which I had a preference about

12:47.050 --> 12:52.635
outfit, and I didn't really know what they were 
talking about there. And I said, what difference

12:52.655 --> 12:54.516
does that make? Well, there's some dorms over on 
this side, they're air conditioned. Others over

12:59.260 --> 13:00.141
here on the other side. And I said, what's the 
difference in cost? And they said, well, air

13:01.582 --> 13:05.806
conditioned dorms will bring the cost of this and 
run air conditioned to this. I said, well, put me in

13:05.826 --> 13:08.248
the un-air conditioned ones. And so that's how I 
ended up in the outfit that I was in, in the Duncan

13:08.268 --> 13:12.652
area. At that point in time, the Corps was in both 
the Duncan area and Sevesa. And I lived in dorm one

13:17.645 --> 13:23.931
on the fourth stoop. So then I got to get to know and 
meet every upperclassmen there was on all four

13:23.951 --> 13:28.395
floors. What I didn't realize then was being a 
waiter in the mess hall was like being in another

13:30.377 --> 13:46.453
outfit and having to get to meet and know all those 
pertinent things about the upperclassmen

13:30.377 --> 13:46.453
waiters. as well as all the upperclassmen on the 
tables that I served. So it was a real introduction

13:51.492 --> 13:58.561
to Corps life very quickly for me. I do know that 
when we came down, I went to fish camp. And they came

14:04.268 --> 14:07.332
down to, folks did, to drop me off. Like I said, I was 
18 years old, first time I'd been away from

14:08.913 --> 14:14.280
Northeast Texas for very much my whole lifetime. 
And I remember going in the dorm, and this is after

14:15.239 --> 14:21.668
fish camp. They brought me my stuff and 
everything. I go in there, and there's just two

14:24.411 --> 14:27.275
upperclassmen. One was introduced as my first 
sergeant, and there was another junior that was

14:27.295 --> 14:32.061
with him. They visited my folks, and they told my 
folks that they'd had some of the same courses that

14:32.081 --> 14:38.990
I had, and they could help me with my studies. And I 
remember remarking that it was nice that I made a

14:39.010 --> 14:43.997
friend the first day. campus, and I thought, yeah, 
it is. They leave, and I have a little lump in my

14:49.162 --> 14:54.928
throat, and I drive off into the quad there, going 
back home. I know I'm on my own, all alone. I go back

14:58.192 --> 15:02.597
in that dorm, and I see these two upper classmen. I 
said, hey, Terry, Rick. I said, Terry, Rick, hey,

15:05.119 --> 15:08.043
Maggie, we don't know you. Get out of here and whip 
out. I had no idea what they were talking about, but

15:09.524 --> 15:13.849
I knew that they were not as friendly as they were 
before. And that just went straight downhill for

15:14.183 --> 15:16.385
me. And I know that I finally got in my room, and I 
said I was going to stay there for a while. And I do

15:22.451 --> 15:27.916
recall later on that day that there was another kid 
came with his grandmother. And pretty much the

15:27.936 --> 15:29.999
same thing happened as soon as grandmother left. 
The treatment started for him, too. And I remember

15:32.581 --> 15:36.485
him running out of the dorm, hollering, 
grandmother, wait. Grandmother, wait. That was

15:38.147 --> 15:39.668
the last we saw of him. So there were 56 freshmen in 
my outfit. that we started with and there were 13 of

15:44.558 --> 15:49.522
us that graduated. What the Corps didn't get, 
grades did. We did not have the, I don't think we had

15:55.388 --> 16:03.035
the restrictions on admissions that we do now. And 
so part of the weeding out process took place in

16:03.976 --> 16:10.582
school. And I do recall that standing on the wall 
that first week, not wanting any sort of shaved

16:13.077 --> 16:20.986
head people sitting next to me very well at all. And 
the COC looked to your left and looked to your right

16:22.288 --> 16:28.095
at the end of the semester, those guys are not going 
to be here. And I thought, well, that was me too. And

16:32.059 --> 16:41.110
sure enough, out of 56, we were down to about 20 some 
odd after the first semester, 30 some odd, 20 some

16:32.059 --> 16:41.110
odd after the second semester. And 13, like I said, 
he graduated. But the thing that I did learn

16:44.154 --> 16:57.026
was I learned so much about myself and my ability to 
deal with persons and situations. And I learned to

16:57.807 --> 17:03.792
assess my fellow man on a different basis than I 
ever had before. One thing that it certainly did

17:05.794 --> 17:11.299
was it made you all equal. We're taught we're equal 
in the eyes of the Lord, but

17:11.768 --> 17:18.355
in society, you're not. You're judged by lots of 
other factors. And there, I was taught you're

17:22.579 --> 17:30.568
judged on two things, and that is your ability and 
the content of your character. And that taught me a

17:30.588 --> 17:35.433
lot about myself and my felony. And I've tried to, 
I've used those things that I was taught there.

17:42.093 --> 17:44.455
more than just about anything else I ever had in my 
life. Describe, particularly during your

17:45.176 --> 17:55.406
freshman year, but any other years, events that an 
outsider might have called hazing. What were some

17:55.426 --> 17:57.568
of the traditions, routines? Well, most 
everything that outsiders would call hazing,

17:58.089 --> 18:04.815
most everything we did would be called hazing. I 
know that there were some physical things that

18:05.656 --> 18:11.442
went on, That certainly get people voted out now. 
Would have been too, but it wasn't pervasive.

18:21.054 --> 18:24.439
There was some swatting on the backside from time 
to time. Who did that? Upper classmen.

18:32.071 --> 18:34.755
But I've never had anybody do anything like that to 
me. But they did it because they wanted to. abused

18:41.189 --> 18:43.352
me, hurt me, or anything else. They did it. It was 
basically one of these little rituals, I guess

18:46.136 --> 18:52.144
you'd say, of passage, so to speak. When they did 
those kind of things, it meant that you had passed

18:52.164 --> 19:01.017
and mustered, you were accepted, you were 
approved, you were liked, you were respected type

18:52.164 --> 19:01.017
of thing. And I was never known with meanness or 
anything else. If it had, I wouldn't have stood for

19:03.400 --> 19:07.085
it. But I still didn't think it was appropriate. 
And I will just tell you that that all of those

19:10.636 --> 19:14.020
things happened to me. And I never did those things 
when I was on the president. I never beat anybody

19:17.304 --> 19:21.749
with a broom or an axe hammer or any of that stuff. I 
just, I might have physically grabbed somebody's

19:21.769 --> 19:28.657
eyes, I say, you know, make them do a lot of 
exercises and stuff like that. What were those,

19:28.677 --> 19:30.980
just tell them about those. Oh, well, you, one 
thing I will say is you had to be physically fit to

19:31.480 --> 19:40.010
survive part of this too. If you were If you were a 
flabby fat boy, you were in trouble. Of course, I

19:44.821 --> 19:48.024
came in here being a foreign boy. I'd been in 
athletics in high school and all those kind of

19:48.044 --> 19:52.590
things. That was OK for me. It was no problem at all. 
Boys that came in that were not in good shape did

19:56.614 --> 20:03.122
suffer as a result of that. Oh, it was physically 
demanding. You had to do push-ups, and you had to do

20:04.404 --> 20:07.407
other things. type of things that were strenuous 
exercises, stuff that you would see on a football

20:07.859 --> 20:16.531
field, but would all be a short duration, would 
last a little longer sometimes. I know that it was

20:18.554 --> 20:28.527
one of those things too that you got punished as a 
class quite often. If some of your classmates

20:28.547 --> 20:36.398
weren't doing as they should, you would end up all 
having to go through certain physical activities

20:37.323 --> 20:51.928
And it eventually got to the point where you, if 
these people persisted in that, and it was

20:37.323 --> 20:51.928
apparent that they just didn't care about their 
fellow fish, that we had a couple meetings with

20:37.323 --> 20:51.928
some of those guys. And I do recall one guy that, he 
was from Chicago and was kind of rude and

20:52.028 --> 21:03.567
obnoxious.

21:05.133 --> 21:13.724
And we got down to the point where we went to him and 
said, we're going to pack your bags and we're going

21:05.133 --> 21:13.724
to send you back home because you're not having it. 
You're hurting. And I do recall that person, I

21:15.727 --> 21:20.633
think for the first time, realizing his life. But 
his actions did affect other folks, and he had a

21:21.334 --> 21:26.141
responsibility to others. And he actually said, 
please, guys, let me just stay. I'll change. And

21:31.788 --> 21:33.270
he's the one of the 13 that graduated. Hey, good, 
good. So. Fish Old Lady, was that an important

21:35.221 --> 21:38.645
person in your life? It was a very important 
person, but it didn't help in my case. I know that my

21:42.591 --> 22:03.017
Fish Old Lady I found was a fish camper friend of 
mine that I met in a state 4-H leadership

21:42.591 --> 22:03.017
conference before and maybe some other function 
out of high school. I thought he was going to be my

22:03.622 --> 22:04.943
roommate. I saw this. It was just wonderful. I know 
this person. His father had attended Texas A&M. He

22:10.068 --> 22:12.150
knew all these things. He knew how to whip out and 
all. And I didn't know what he was talking about. I

22:17.856 --> 22:18.357
had no clue. I was totally clueless. And I thought, 
boy, it's great that I found someone that I know

22:20.239 --> 22:25.364
that has his background. He's going to be really 
helpful. We get here, and he just totally spazzes

22:27.506 --> 22:30.429
out. He is frightened to death. He will not go out. I 
have to go out in the hall first because he can't

22:34.387 --> 22:38.913
remember the names, and I have to speak to 
everybody he had followed what I said. He would

22:38.953 --> 22:41.497
never leave his room. I mean, it was horrible. He 
would get up at like 4 in the morning and take his

22:45.582 --> 22:55.375
books and hide them in bushes around buildings off 
the quad so he wouldn't have to come back in the

22:45.582 --> 22:55.375
morning to chat. And I had to clean up the room by 
myself and all that kind of stuff. He could not wait

22:58.679 --> 23:02.164
until the first semester was over with until he 
could leave. And he got a point. I was thinking,

23:05.202 --> 23:07.425
please, I'd be glad if you came. And he did leave. He 
went to the University of Texas. And someone told

23:10.788 --> 23:16.114
me not too long ago that he operates a bicycle 
repair shop there on the strip. He's got hair down

23:17.055 --> 23:19.258
to his waist. And he's the perpetual hippie over 
there, a 50-some-odd-year-old hippie now. But

23:25.605 --> 23:27.727
that's where he ended up. I ended up then, second 
semester. As a matter of fact, they would not let

23:31.812 --> 23:33.113
you After the first two weeks, you didn't get out of 
the Corps by then. They would not let you out until

23:37.644 --> 23:39.887
the end of the first semester. And so, as soon as 
that was over, he was gone. Then I had a, I ran with

23:44.511 --> 23:47.354
another guy. He was a good guy. He was from North 
Texas at Iowa Park, north of Wichita Falls. And he

23:54.741 --> 23:59.645
was an ag engineering major. He ended up with his 
Ph.D. here at A&M. and good guy and he was my

24:03.181 --> 24:29.273
roommate for that second semester my fish year and 
second semester my first semester my sophomore

24:03.181 --> 24:29.273
year and he ended getting married and i had another 
roommate in the outfit for the second semester

24:03.181 --> 24:29.273
then i went on staff my junior senior year and had 
different roommates there too but after that

24:03.181 --> 24:29.273
first semester i had wonderful roommates i mean 
guys i truly cherish uh You described chow hall

24:30.063 --> 24:32.145
routine. Since you were a waiter, you didn't eat 
with your outfit. Tell me about the life of a

24:36.649 --> 24:38.391
waiter. I did the second semester. Because, Dr. 
Moreau, what I realized was I was missing out with

24:41.173 --> 24:54.185
some of those opportunities for my fish buddies in 
my outfit because I missed the formations and

24:41.173 --> 24:54.185
stuff because I had to go down. Now, of course, I was 
going through the stuff in the mess hall that they

24:54.205 --> 24:59.310
were going through there, they didn't know that 
and I wasn't getting to know those guys like I'd

24:59.611 --> 25:24.471
like to and so I was able to give me another job on 
campus that allowed me a little more flexibility

24:59.611 --> 25:24.471
and I could work more hours in every time I had a 
couple hour break I could go to work you know and so I

24:59.611 --> 25:24.471
was able to earn more than waiting tables in the 
mess hall so that was the first thing Second

25:25.447 --> 25:27.449
semester, I did a little. Describe mess hall. Oh, 
it was. Routines, traditions, games. Oh,

25:33.515 --> 25:44.506
basically,

25:33.515 --> 25:44.506
the mess hall was not a place where you got to 
languish and eat at your heart's content. It was an

25:44.606 --> 25:51.192
area of constant harassment and consternation to 
all the freshmen. I know I said at the table there

25:51.212 --> 25:53.074
were three freshmen. And they had two seniors, a 
junior, two sophomores, and three freshmen. Two

26:01.304 --> 26:05.028
of us ran hot corner, which is where they deliver 
the food, the corner end of the table. And we passed

26:05.288 --> 26:06.349
everything down. And then one guy was giving meal 
service to the senior. And then I would give meal

26:09.913 --> 26:17.940
service to the junior who was next to me, who ended 
up being president of his class and the whole bit.

26:17.960 --> 26:21.584
And he was on the association board and 
everything. But anyway. It was, it was, you could

26:23.834 --> 26:29.683
never eat small bites in front of your chair. So you 
never got to eat very much. But we got around those

26:32.346 --> 26:36.412
circumstances, situations. And I never recall 
that one of the sophomores on the table was this guy

26:36.432 --> 26:43.763
from, the way I'll text his name is Ernesto J. Pena 
III. Blonde hair and blue eyes. And he would, his

26:49.051 --> 26:53.217
favorite thing was making me which were the 
peppers. If you smiled, he'd do something to make

26:56.238 --> 26:58.421
you smile. He'd say, oh, Fish, I can't eat some 
buzzberries and stuff. I'd eat those

27:01.725 --> 27:04.689
buzzberries, but it didn't bother me too much. But 
at our table, we had the three freshmen. We had some

27:09.575 --> 27:11.638
real line-up for class. They assigned us a certain 
task. One of the freshmen, his father was

27:16.504 --> 27:21.651
commander of the Special Forces in Vietnam at the 
time. And so he had to give a report on the war and

27:22.357 --> 27:28.983
things of this nature. The other guy, he had to give 
a report on other national affairs and things of

27:29.003 --> 27:35.930
this nature. And mine was unusual rapes, deaths, 
and murders. And so we'd get through at the mill,

27:40.494 --> 27:43.897
and they'd say, OK, it's report time. And other 
upperclassmen would move their chairs around,

27:44.397 --> 27:48.541
and we'd go through the reports. And they'd say, 
ah, Youngkin, it's your turn. And I'd go through.

27:52.411 --> 28:07.311
some 80-some-odd-year-old grandmother in Italy 
that died after she tried to dive off of a patio to

27:52.411 --> 28:07.311
get down to another patio and catch it so she could 
get in the children who were locked in their

27:52.411 --> 28:07.311
apartment or whatever. And some bizarre things. 
You know, they say, oh, you're lying, you're

28:09.595 --> 28:10.896
lying. Oh, no, sir. And I pulled out the article 
that I'd gone over the library. You found these

28:14.321 --> 28:18.166
things in the San Antonio Light and the San Antonio 
News Express for some reason. One of these really

28:18.186 --> 28:21.591
warped stories. So, but that happened on a nightly 
basis. And as soon as the upperclassmen would

28:24.599 --> 28:30.685
leave, one of my good friends would always say, hey 
guys, junior privileges. And we'd start eating

28:30.705 --> 28:32.607
like that. And the upperclassmen would pretty 
much go at that point. And so another

28:34.668 --> 28:38.152
upperclassman came up and said, we've got junior 
privileges. So we'd eat. What were the nicknames

28:40.394 --> 28:43.697
for the food items? Oh, you had all of them. You 
couldn't call anything by its regular name. And I

28:47.760 --> 28:50.903
still recall every one of those things. salt, 
pepper, and sand in. All meat, no matter what it

28:54.261 --> 28:58.087
was, was bull neck.

28:59.910 --> 29:00.851
Bread was deal. You know, if you deal out the loaves 
of bread like you would cards.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.622
Water was sky.

29:11.827 --> 29:12.788
Butter was grease.

29:15.432 --> 29:16.994
It was everything. Tea? Tea was, I don't know, what 
the heck was tea? Dessert?

29:25.735 --> 29:26.496
Dessert was cush. Dang, what was it? But anyway, 
beans was artillery. It was all kinds of things for

29:34.685 --> 29:37.268
all the foods. I had to dine for it. And a lot of the 
things that went on at the Mesa were also kind of

29:39.510 --> 29:45.937
those memories that you keep. They'd make you do 
things to the other upperclassmen, like set their

29:45.977 --> 29:50.522
bibs on fire. When you saw people at a table and they 
were up there eating, all of a sudden you just kind

29:51.059 --> 30:09.237
of see them pooch back in their seats, meant there 
was some freshman crawling under the table to get

29:51.059 --> 30:09.237
to the silver classmate at the end of the table, and 
they would light his paper napkin he had in his lap,

29:51.059 --> 30:09.237
and all of a sudden he'd flame, he'd jump up and 
start fanning and beating himself. But the worst

30:10.218 --> 30:20.188
thing that happened to me, and of course I did to 
folks when I was a freshman, was they'd tell you

30:10.218 --> 30:20.188
that as a freshman to grease somebody so you'd have 
these big pats of butter And they'd have you take

30:21.063 --> 30:26.310
these pads and put them in your hand until they got 
real soft. Then you'd go up behind the

30:26.330 --> 30:34.601
upperclassmen that you're supposed to grease, 
and you'd go and slap this over his ears, which put

30:26.330 --> 30:34.601
the butter into his ear. And the only way you'd get 
out is you'd take a nap, and you'd just screw it

30:34.661 --> 30:42.852
around in your ear, and you'd finally got out 
enough where you could go get water in there to

30:34.661 --> 30:42.852
shower it out. But it was terrible. It was funny, 
too. Let's see. Your outfit? I was in Company B2.

30:51.168 --> 30:53.551
Booze and D, which has recently been disbanded. 
What was the nickname? Booze and D. Some of the kids

30:55.073 --> 31:05.725
came about a year ago or not a year ago, about three 
or four years ago, and said, Mr. Jenkins, you know,

30:55.073 --> 31:05.725
they want us to change our outfit sign. They want to 
take the stars and bars off our sign. Apparently,

31:08.488 --> 31:11.111
the Confederate stars and bars were on the outfit 
sign. I never realized that. And I told them, I

31:14.195 --> 31:16.658
said, well, I wouldn't worry about that. I'd worry 
about them wanting to change your name. They said,

31:18.420 --> 31:19.281
why is that? I said, it's my mom. I hated that name. I 
said, what are y'all just sitting around and

31:21.942 --> 31:24.351
drinking all the time? I said, no, Mom, we don't. 
But anyway, she hated that name.
