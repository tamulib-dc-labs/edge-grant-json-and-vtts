WEBVTT

00:04.486 --> 00:08.913
What is your full name? Thank you for your full 
name. What's your telephone number? Full name.

00:13.079 --> 00:14.722
Everybody calls you Mrs. Beathard. That's all 
right. Flossie. Flossie? I was Yocum. Flossie

00:17.205 --> 00:18.568
Yocum Beathard. Flossie Yocum Beathard. Right. 
That's B-E-A-T-H-A-R. Right. This is August 9th.

00:25.278 --> 00:26.360
We're in Milano, Texas. That's right. We're 
inside a gas station grocery store. We're talking

00:29.865 --> 00:31.928
to Mrs. Beathard, who... I was born in 1904, 
weren't you? 1904. Here in Milano, or was it right

00:35.402 --> 00:37.686
over there? Over on Highway 79, over there. I was 
born on one of the, what was it, the old Summers

00:39.349 --> 00:43.116
Place at the time. My daddy didn't own any land at 
that time. A little old rent house over there is

00:47.003 --> 00:49.327
where I was born. Was your father a sharecropper? 
No, no. Well, for a while he was. For a while he

00:54.396 --> 00:57.021
rented, and then he bought him a place, see. They 
bought him 132 acres. So he was able to be a renter

00:59.741 --> 01:03.444
and save up enough money to buy it. Yes, yes he did. 
How was your father involved with the mines? He

01:09.670 --> 01:11.172
worked in the mine quite a bit. He actually worked 
in the mine some. Okay, and what was his name?

01:16.176 --> 01:18.278
Walter, Walter Yochum. Walter Yochum. That's 
right, okay. He worked in the mine, and also my

01:20.660 --> 01:24.944
grandpa McCoy worked in the mine. He was Daniel 
McCoy. He's the one that got hurt in the mind. You

01:29.882 --> 01:38.344
know, I was telling you yesterday about some of it 
falling in on him and they brought him up and the

01:29.882 --> 01:38.344
company doctor was there. They called him and my 
daddy was the only one that could hold him because

01:38.364 --> 01:42.735
he was in so much pain. The others left. They 
couldn't stand to see him in so much pain, see. Do

01:47.165 --> 01:48.686
you remember about what year that was? It must have 
been about 1906, about that. You were about two

01:51.589 --> 01:52.610
years old. I was about two years old. Do you 
remember which mine you're on? That was the big

01:55.993 --> 01:57.074
lump. Big lump. Yes. Because part of that coal come 
out from under his place. And my grandmother drew a

02:00.437 --> 02:03.661
little rod off that coal for many years. See, back 
then there weren't any old age pensions at all. And

02:07.184 --> 02:09.446
that helped her a lot, my grandma McCoy. It helped 
her quite a bit. And I remember she'd tell my mama,

02:13.293 --> 02:16.097
well, I got my money today. And that, you see, I 
suppose the reason, one reason, he liked to work

02:16.598 --> 02:19.903
there. And, of course, my daddy was his 
son-in-law, you see, and they sort of all worked

02:20.363 --> 02:25.090
together. And then when my Uncle Dave got big 
enough, he went to work in it. I see. Well, did they

02:30.238 --> 02:32.541
have a foreman system, a gang system? Something 
like that, yes. Sort of a straw boss, you know. One

02:37.228 --> 02:39.070
that kept books, too, you know. And...

02:44.427 --> 02:47.491
And we're speaking about the people over there, 
those Mexican people. A lot of them, they have

02:48.151 --> 02:50.735
pretty flowers in their yard. Seemed like they 
wanted flowers and they'd have a little garden. I

02:53.778 --> 02:57.122
remember the corn growing and their peppers, you 
know. They're like lots of hot pepper, you see. And

03:01.688 --> 03:03.930
they ground corn themselves? I think so. I believe 
some of them did. And like I said, the young women,

03:07.254 --> 03:11.920
it was very dressy when they went out, you know. And 
that was usually just on the weekends? Usually on

03:14.171 --> 03:17.796
Saturday afternoons, you'd see them walk into 
town, you know. They'd walk to Rockdale? They'd

03:20.019 --> 03:22.503
walk to Rockdale, Rockdale. And that was two to 
four miles? Yes, quite a spell, you see. Of course,

03:27.410 --> 03:31.916
some of them on up to Texas Mine, they'd walk up 
there, too, and we'd see them, you see. I see. They

03:33.018 --> 03:35.682
had their own cemetery, even, and it's still over 
there. Oh, really? A Mexican cemetery. And when

03:39.187 --> 03:41.991
we'd come back home from Rockdale a little late, 
And after they'd had a funeral, see, they'd leave

03:42.393 --> 03:45.476
candles burning. And it sure would look spooky out 
there in that cemetery, you know, all those

03:46.056 --> 03:51.221
candles and flowers and everything. It's still 
there. Well, did the Mexicans have a separate

03:52.161 --> 03:55.104
church? Yes, they did. They had the Catholic 
Church over there. The Catholic Church near the

03:57.526 --> 04:00.468
Texas Coal Company? It is across the street there, 
the road, rather, from Big Blunt Commissary. Most

04:07.134 --> 04:09.296
of them did go there. Do you remember the name of it? 
No, I don't. I really don't. What church did you go

04:14.513 --> 04:16.515
to? Well, we usually went there to Sandy Creek. 
Whoever was preaching it, you know, we'd go to the

04:19.479 --> 04:24.005
Baptists or the Methodists or the Church of 
Christ, you know. Sounds good. Just whoever you

04:24.526 --> 04:25.647
like to hear. Yeah, we'd go and have those 
protracted meetings, you know, and have a week's

04:25.667 --> 04:31.555
meeting. We'd go at night. They had beautiful 
singing, you know, and we enjoyed it. But the

04:36.501 --> 04:38.944
Mexicans even had their own school over there. one 
of the vulgar girls taught school over there wow

04:39.228 --> 04:59.565
now that is later though gusta that's the vulgar 
she taught school i don't know if that's still

04:39.228 --> 04:59.565
living or not 1920s i really don't know somewhere 
like that i think yeah i know it's before i ever

04:39.228 --> 04:59.565
married so i don't know whether gusta and middle 
still living or not it's a pretty girl You were

05:00.372 --> 05:03.475
telling me yesterday that your father cut timber. 
Oh, yes. Out of the woods, out of our woods. Out of

05:08.640 --> 05:09.261
your woods. Yes, yes. And they had to be big, and 
they had to be pretty tall where a man could stand

05:11.263 --> 05:14.666
up. And then they'd frame it from one big post to the 
other in there, frame it up, as they called it, to

05:15.307 --> 05:21.213
keep that dirt off of them. So he would have to take 
the bark off of them? No, they didn't have to be

05:23.155 --> 05:24.576
bark. Just saw the edges smooth and have all the 
limbs cut. They had to be, you know. That's all

05:29.448 --> 05:30.089
right. No, he didn't have to cut the bark off. He 
used a cross saw to cut all this? Yes. He used an axe

05:34.516 --> 05:35.939
to cut them down? Well, I think he sawed them down 
mostly with a saw, some kind of an axe. But then the

05:38.904 --> 05:41.568
ends had to be tall and smooth, you see. Did he do 
this by himself? Yes. Yes. I've seen scars on his

05:45.194 --> 05:48.460
shoulders where he lifted them heavy things. He 
must have been a big man. He was. He was a pretty good

05:49.602 --> 05:50.463
size. Healthy and young, you know. He didn't mind 
looking. But I went with him here and everywhere he

05:55.201 --> 05:58.725
went, you know, helped him open gates. You were his 
favorite daughter? Well, they say I was, but

06:00.107 --> 06:09.237
because I was always hanging around, see, it 
wasn't that he really cared more about me than I was

06:00.107 --> 06:09.237
always there underfoot. And if he got ready to go to 
Rockdale, I'd go harness his team up, see, his

06:10.238 --> 06:14.163
horse. I knew how to put the harness on her, see, 
back into the buggy. fix her up and get ready. I

06:20.670 --> 06:26.197
could get ready to go in five minutes, and my older 
sister would take her hour, because she had to fix

06:20.670 --> 06:26.197
her hair all pretty. Right. Well, did you go to 
school in Rockville? No, we went to Sandy Creek and

06:29.742 --> 06:31.904
Milano. Sandy Creek and Milano. Papa would send us 
a while at Sandy Creek, and then he'd send us to

06:33.206 --> 06:36.430
Milano. I don't know why, but he did that. How many 
months out of the year did you go to school? Oh,

06:41.276 --> 06:43.539
about seven months, sometime eight. But I 
remember I took Latin one year, and it was plum

06:46.283 --> 06:48.966
funny. The teacher didn't know algebra. They were 
going to teach us algebra to come at a time to have

06:52.183 --> 06:55.427
algebra. She didn't know algebra. She said, well, 
just take a year of Latin. Now, you know that Latin.

07:00.013 --> 07:01.594
It didn't ever do anyone any good. She was going to 
make a pharmacist or a doctor or something. Do you

07:06.280 --> 07:11.346
know what were the same courses offered in your 
school as were offered in the Mexican schools? I

07:11.366 --> 07:13.048
don't really know, but I think so. I think they were 
about the same. I wish you could see Gusta, and ask

07:15.338 --> 07:18.902
her about these things. But she's older than me. 
She may not be living yet. Gusta, G-U-S-T-A, Gusta

07:22.305 --> 07:24.628
Vogel. She had a sister named Menta. It's a pretty 
black-headed girl. They looked Italian, but they

07:28.051 --> 07:31.115
weren't Italian people. They were German, 
actually. I think so. I think so. They were pretty.

07:34.799 --> 07:40.705
Well, did you ever have social gatherings with 
Mexican miners? Not really not, no. Very little

07:42.667 --> 07:43.448
contact. Very little contact with. They was 
always friendly, and like I was talking to Simone

07:45.140 --> 07:49.866
Dowd and about it, I said, we never had any trouble 
with those people. They were nice and good, most of

07:50.207 --> 07:52.350
them, see. Seemed like they was all pretty 
peaceable. And one thing to it, they was very

07:56.355 --> 07:58.818
devoted to their families. Close-knit families, 
all of them, see, seemed like. They didn't travel

08:02.824 --> 08:04.206
around much? Not too much. They just came to town on 
the weekends? Came to town on the weekends, seemed

08:07.130 --> 08:10.274
like, go to church or something like that, you 
know. Then you just didn't see them? No, you didn't

08:11.836 --> 08:13.358
see them much, no. You said something about that 
you and your father sold a truck farm to you? Oh,

08:18.039 --> 08:18.500
yes. Yes, we'd go through those camps, you know. 
Well, he wouldn't let me go with him much when he was

08:21.565 --> 08:25.230
selling watermelons. We'd raise watermelons, 
you see, and take them through there. Sandias,

08:28.115 --> 08:31.340
Sandias, they'd buy those watermelons, don't you 
see? Sandias is watermelons? And we sold them

08:34.725 --> 08:39.252
cheap, but it was a little money in the summertime, 
don't you see? Before the cotton got ready to pick.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.523
So your father was mainly a cotton farmer. That's 
right, that's right. When did he quit farming?

08:48.187 --> 08:50.230
When he got too old. What about mining? Oh, he 
didn't work in the mine very long. When he got his

08:54.054 --> 08:55.355
land, he quit. Okay, so by working in the mine, he 
was able to save his money to buy his land. Well, no,

09:00.041 --> 09:01.302
not really. He sharecropped. He worked, you see, 
he rented the land, see, rented land first, you

09:02.984 --> 09:07.709
see, before he bought his. And then he bought land 
that could be mine. Mm-hmm. Do you remember about

09:10.460 --> 09:12.683
what year he started mining? Well, he just worked 
in the mine, you know. When I was a child, a little,

09:16.990 --> 09:20.695
two and three years old, when he worked in the mine, 
you see. And later, he done all I remember. I don't

09:24.100 --> 09:26.564
even hardly remember him working in the mine, you 
see. I remember Uncle Dave working in the mine. And

09:28.086 --> 09:30.750
that was your father's older brother? No, it was 
Mama's brother, you see. Uncle Dave McCoy. See, I

09:35.717 --> 09:36.538
was a yokel. My daddy was yokel. And your mother was 
McCoy? McCoy. Do you know where they came from,

09:40.008 --> 09:44.294
where the McCoys came from? No, I really don't 
know. I know more about my daddy's people than I did

09:46.737 --> 09:49.601
my mama's people. He was Irish, and I think he had a 
blue uniform, which looked like, as we used to say,

09:50.261 --> 09:57.311
I believe he's a Yankee. But I'm not sure. He was a 
good man.

10:03.819 --> 10:05.101
So he was born here in the United States? Yes, oh 
yes, oh yes. Did his parents immigrate over? No,

10:09.756 --> 10:10.877
no. They were born here also? Mm-hmm. Now, my 
daddy's people is different all the time. Papa's

10:18.028 --> 10:23.936
daddy was about quarter Indian, and he was a Civil 
War veteran. My grandpa Yocum, see?

10:29.364 --> 10:30.365
He didn't like Yankees. He was born in Virginia, 
and he was in the last battle he was in, the Battle of

10:31.807 --> 10:37.015
Gettysburg. We were wounded. So your grandfather 
was a Confederate soldier. Right. And your father

10:43.606 --> 10:48.551
was the Irishman you were talking about? No, my 
grandpa McCoy. McCoy, OK. He was the Irishman. I

10:51.514 --> 10:52.415
want to make that clear. Yes. McCoy was the 
Irishman. And he was the Irishman, yes. But we've

10:57.080 --> 10:58.361
got away from the mining. You're not going to learn 
anything about it. Well, that's all important. We

11:01.264 --> 11:04.428
need to find out where everybody came from. So my 
grandpa was born in Virginia. Like I say, he got

11:07.673 --> 11:10.056
wounded in Gettysburg and had to walk home. That's 
Pennsylvania, you know. You see? He walked home.

11:15.081 --> 11:16.723
He was a big man, quarter Indian. Do you think he'd 
done any mining in Pennsylvania before he came

11:18.104 --> 11:22.469
here? No. No, because he was born in Virginia, you 
see. And he was carpenter and a schoolteacher, my

11:26.834 --> 11:33.000
grandpa Yoakum was, until he joined the rebel 
army, see? He taught school and was a carpenter.

11:35.663 --> 11:37.365
And then he came to Texas after school? Yes. Oh, 
yes. Well, you know, back to the mining, how did the

11:40.448 --> 11:47.317
people of Rockdale and Milano view the mines? It 
seems that most of this area is agricultural. Were

11:50.901 --> 11:52.823
the mines a positive thing? Yes, it was all right. 
It was a help. Some people, even, like I say, white

11:56.488 --> 12:01.875
people, worked there, and it was a help to them. And 
they didn't resent the Mexicans, didn't seem like

12:01.895 --> 12:06.200
at all. I know we didn't. You want to go ahead and 
take care of your business here? Oh, yeah. It

12:12.748 --> 12:13.288
really is. One thing I'm curious about, again, you 
may not know the answer to this, but that's all

12:13.869 --> 12:22.340
right. But did your father and your uncle, did they 
sing in the mines at all? Did the Mexicans sing

12:28.488 --> 12:31.252
songs as they were working? I don't remember for 
sure whether they ever spoke of them singing there

12:32.193 --> 12:36.118
or not. They're hard-working people.

12:41.554 --> 12:44.739
I don't know whether they ever did or not. But they 
had, they loved music, you know. I think they had

12:48.285 --> 12:51.871
most of their music at home when they got home, you 
know. You're talking about the Mexicans? The

12:53.835 --> 12:54.516
Mexicans, uh-huh. Yes. I saw one place where, uh, 
that the white families would hire the Mexican

12:57.732 --> 13:01.397
bands for parties. Do you remember any of that? Not 
really. That must have been over around Rockland

13:04.001 --> 13:06.525
or where you see it. I was over here closer to 
Milano, you know, in Sandy Creek. Well, would you

13:10.911 --> 13:15.117
consider Milano and Sandy Creek more center 
mining area in Rockdale? No, I don't think so. I

13:21.573 --> 13:27.521
think Sandy Creek and Rockdale would be more of the 
center of mining, because Sandow was down there

13:21.573 --> 13:27.521
way a long time ago. Sandow, which is now, as you 
know, Alcoa. And they had a Sandow mine down there a

13:30.965 --> 13:34.850
long years ago, you see. They had that, they still 
have it, that Sandow Southern Railroad. They

13:41.472 --> 13:42.293
still have that. Once your daddy quit mining and 
went to cotton farming and agricultural work, did

13:42.393 --> 13:53.768
you have occasion to run into miners? Oh, well, 
once in a while, some of the boys that worked in the

13:54.750 --> 13:58.875
mine went to school with us. Oh, yes, the white 
boys. The white boys. Uh-huh, the white boys. No,

14:02.360 --> 14:04.382
they had their own school over there. But we 
wouldn't have resented them. You know, I wouldn't

14:07.306 --> 14:08.728
have. Did they have Mexican teachers, or were 
they... No, you see my second or third or fourth

14:08.928 --> 14:16.641
cousin, she was distal to Gustav Vogel. She was a 
black girl, you see. She taught the Mexican

14:19.145 --> 14:21.148
children. And I have wondered, I guess she taught 
them English, you see. Surely she didn't teach

14:27.298 --> 14:33.428
them Spanish, because

14:27.298 --> 14:33.428
they are, you know... So you think... That's where 
the young Mexican children learn English within

14:34.173 --> 14:39.037
their school. Yes, I do. Do you remember where the 
Mexicans came from? Do you remember how they got to

14:43.901 --> 14:46.764
Mexico? Not really, just like they do now, I guess, 
from Mexico. See, we still occasionally have

14:50.687 --> 14:54.130
Mexicans around here that can't speak any English 
at all. So there'd be illegal aliens? Some of them.

14:58.633 --> 15:01.176
But back then they didn't pay much attention to 
that. But they weren't naturalized citizens. A

15:03.357 --> 15:04.078
lot of them weren't. Sure they weren't. Did they 
seem to be happy with the day in the mine? Yes. Yes,

15:09.678 --> 15:10.259
it did. I believe they were happy, yes. Well, what 
happened when the mine wasn't operating? What did

15:16.848 --> 15:18.471
the Mexican families do? Well, it was much—they 
operated for a long, long, long time. And it seemed

15:25.140 --> 15:29.527
like if one closed or kind of slowed up, they'd just 
go over the other one. I see. You see what I mean?

15:30.809 --> 15:31.129
Right. So there weren't that many new people 
coming in and the same people moving from mind to

15:31.430 --> 15:36.502
mind? I think so. Do you remember any labor unions 
or labor troubles? No, not really. No, I don't

15:43.579 --> 15:46.787
think they had any trouble with them letting me get 
to this place. Sure.

15:56.219 --> 16:00.304
Right, so you did go, did you visit the Texas coal 
camp at all? Just through it, just through it, you

16:00.464 --> 16:05.130
know, you couldn't. My daddy would never let me 
around the mines at all. See, the reason, I wish I

16:08.134 --> 16:15.904
could have gone, you know, into the mines, or close 
and let them work a little more. Yeah, but your dad

16:15.944 --> 16:17.746
wouldn't let you. No, no, indeed no, indeed no. 
Well,

16:22.561 --> 16:28.550
it looked like two and three, two and three rooms. 
Sometimes a little porch and sometimes no porch.

16:32.276 --> 16:36.142
Sometimes they looked pretty bedraggled, 
pretty, you know, shackly. Sometimes they looked

16:36.162 --> 16:38.306
pretty good. You know, I think the company built 
those houses. There's a few of them painted. But I

16:43.454 --> 16:47.119
know they tried to look like, keep their yards 
clean, like I said, with flowers. Very energetic

16:48.542 --> 16:50.104
people, it seemed like. have their little gardens 
and things you know women were there any women that

16:51.232 --> 17:13.965
worked in mind no not really no no no they always had 
a bunch of children you know there's a lot always

16:51.232 --> 17:13.965
lots of children in the mexican families you know 
they're all you know catholics and they believe

16:51.232 --> 17:13.965
you know they believe in children right you see you 
know how young the children were they went to work

16:51.232 --> 17:13.965
for the mines Or was there a law? I don't think 
there's any law, really. I think some of them could

17:17.560 --> 17:19.603
go to work at 15 or 16. I knew a white boy that went to 
school over at Sandy Creek, and I think he was about

17:19.924 --> 17:25.152
16 and he worked in the mine. Because I remember 
he'd get his face all black, and he couldn't hardly

17:25.672 --> 17:33.124
get all that black coal out of the pores of his skin, 
you know. It's hard to get clean. Kind of like this

17:36.088 --> 17:39.153
coal over here at IGC in Alcoa now, you know. It 
really gets in there. How did your dad get the coal

17:41.080 --> 17:43.383
off of you? Oh, he just, like the rest of them, just 
scrubbed it off the best he could, you know. Was he

17:47.848 --> 17:49.250
in a strong lie zone? Oh, no, no, no. Well, you see, 
after they got grown, what I mean, really have a

17:50.952 --> 17:57.300
beard, a lot of that would shave off, really, you 
see. Papa always went slick shaved. And so they

18:01.365 --> 18:03.508
didn't really have much trouble with that. They 
lacked a little money, and like I say, now that

18:05.210 --> 18:08.995
helped the people in general. You know what I mean? 
Yes, because...

18:10.531 --> 18:16.798
You say there's very few black people that work? 
That's right. Very few black people that work at

18:17.479 --> 18:20.022
the mine. Did

18:20.483 --> 18:27.871
most black people just farm back then? Yes, and 
farm, you know, and work for other people back then

18:27.891 --> 18:30.955
days. Pick cotton for people and worked in the 
fields for them. And you see, they weren't allowed

18:34.719 --> 18:39.505
to go to our schools at that time, you see. They had 
their own schools. They had their own church also?

18:43.971 --> 18:44.893
Well, they still do that. They still do that. These 
people right here have got their own church right

18:46.074 --> 18:50.561
down here in this community. Did the Mexicans and 
the blacks get together at all? Not much back in

18:54.127 --> 18:55.969
them days. They seemed like they weren't very 
sociable between each other. Now, you know,

18:59.414 --> 19:03.661
there's always exceptions to the rules. It's like 
you'd meet someone that you liked, someone you

19:04.382 --> 19:07.787
didn't, or something like that. They didn't 
really mix. I think the Mexican people thought

19:10.457 --> 19:16.163
they were just a little bit, I'll put it this way, 
above the blacks. In the back, just the same way.

19:19.947 --> 19:21.769
Each one was a little proud of his race. We'll put it 
like that.

19:25.513 --> 19:25.653
Okay. If we go back to the mine sites that you did 
see, you were talking about the flowers and the

19:26.654 --> 19:34.723
particular attacks. Did they have a cooking... 
mostly of the inside mostly of the inside yes

19:37.754 --> 20:07.710
because we can see them stove pipes you know with 
the stove inside then of course like i say they they

19:37.754 --> 20:07.710
use lignite i'm sure because the smoke was too 
black would you think those were the old franklin

19:37.754 --> 20:07.710
stoves well just old iron wood stoves i think yeah 
yes but you see you could get them that burn wood or

19:37.754 --> 20:07.710
coal either one i had one at one time and it would 
they had the special coal grate in there you see i

19:37.754 --> 20:07.710
took the coal grate out and used wood 40, 50 years 
ago, back when I was sort of young. Did you like to

20:13.459 --> 20:15.341
cook with lignite coal? I never did get to cook with 
it. See, we took that grate out of our stove and used

20:16.742 --> 20:19.365
wood. I never did use the coal at all. Why was that? 
Because wood was... Wood was plentiful at that

20:24.350 --> 20:26.872
time, you see. Everybody had their own way of 
getting their wood, you know, and preparing it for

20:28.293 --> 20:33.939
the winter and for the stove. We had fireplaces.

20:38.639 --> 20:44.846
What happened in the late 20s, early 30s, when the 
rest of the country was going through a

20:38.639 --> 20:44.846
devastating depression? It was terrible. There 
was a change here? There was a drastic change here.

20:50.673 --> 21:00.645
The people that owned their homes and already had 
their cattle, their chickens, their hogs, had a

20:50.673 --> 21:00.645
little money. They'd done pretty good. I'll tell 
you why. Most of them, they learned to grow their

21:05.250 --> 21:08.494
own food most days. their sweet potatoes, their 
ice potatoes, their fruits, peanuts, all of that,

21:08.710 --> 21:15.936
corn, make their corn meal if they needed it. And 
we, and raise hogs and have their meat, you see. So

21:21.521 --> 21:24.603
they didn't depend on store-bought things 
altogether. Didn't take much money. And the ones

21:28.246 --> 21:31.109
that had their own homes, done fairly well. My 
daddy and mother did.

21:36.093 --> 21:38.515
But some of them, you know, that didn't, It's 
pretty rough. Well, would the miners be in that

21:40.306 --> 21:42.368
category? How did they get through the 
depression? A lot of that had done slowed up then.

21:49.175 --> 21:53.018
Excuse me. I don't know. You see, later on, we 
didn't have any relief for anyone then. But later,

21:58.784 --> 22:00.986
they did have. I don't know when it was. In the 30s, I 
think. Well, one thing I noticed. Excuse me. Sure.

22:08.013 --> 22:08.113
Sure. Around 1931, Rockdale was turning out the 
highest volume of lignite. And I was just

22:17.293 --> 22:22.461
wondering how that worked in. Well, it still 
helped. It all helped. And I expect the miners

22:26.928 --> 22:33.118
didn't suffer as much as the farmers.

22:34.881 --> 22:37.425
Now, for instance, the people worked on the 
railroad. They had their money. They done pretty

22:39.229 --> 22:40.790
good, see? People without jobs, though, it's 
rough. They didn't own any land. They didn't own

22:46.275 --> 22:47.216
their homes. You see what I mean? There's certain 
classes of people that it hurt worse than others,

22:48.937 --> 22:53.241
is what I'm trying to say. You don't think miners 
were hurt that much? Not really, no. Do you

22:58.385 --> 23:04.611
remember when the first truck came to this area? 
First truck? Yeah. Oh, man. That's

23:09.029 --> 23:14.115
hard to say. Did they use trucks in coal mines, or 
was it mainly railroads and mules? Railroads and

23:19.321 --> 23:20.823
mules. They had them little spurs. They run a 
little track out to these mines, you see, to pick

23:23.426 --> 23:28.952
this coal up. You see? Especially little 
railroads, little tracks made, you see, to go out

23:29.993 --> 23:33.037
to these. We called them spurs. They loaded that on 
those cars. And I think they took them over around

23:37.345 --> 23:42.010
Taylor, or somewhere, and shipped it off. Alcoa, 
you see, it was Sandow then, they had their own

23:43.692 --> 23:47.337
railroad. And they brought it out. And these, 
right over at Big Lump, they had a spur. I'd come in

23:55.786 --> 24:01.373
and picked it up, and over to Texas Mines and all, of 
Ogles and them others. And the little old roads

24:02.354 --> 24:06.559
were sort of small. Once one man got killed over 
there. It was a white man, too. One of them little

24:13.440 --> 24:15.824
coal cars ran over him and killed him. Do you 
remember that when that was? No, I don't. I think it

24:19.871 --> 24:20.973
was in the 30s. I really do think it was in the early 
30s. Guy Clymore. Guy Clymore? Mm-hmm. He got

24:27.584 --> 24:28.746
killed. C-L-Y-M-O-R-E? Mm-hmm. See, I can check 
that. Yes, you could. You can check that out. One

24:35.581 --> 24:38.404
thing, did you ever go inside one of the 
commissaries? Yeah. What did the day look like?

24:41.126 --> 24:43.709
Well, I was talking about that to Alvin this 
morning. I said, there's two of them that I've been

24:43.769 --> 24:45.471
in. I said, it looked a little like, part of it like 
the old-fashioned banks used to be, you know. Them

24:50.115 --> 24:56.442
enclosures where, you know, it was where they paid 
their men, paid their people, and where you could

24:50.115 --> 24:56.442
pay for what you got. You know, cages like in there. 
Oh, I... It is... Wire, heavy wire, whatever you

25:01.973 --> 25:03.955
want to call it. A grate? Uh-huh, like that. That's 
what I'm trying to say. They had a little opening

25:08.761 --> 25:11.925
where they could pass money back and forth. Where 
were the goods? Oh, just stacked up around. Just

25:15.269 --> 25:19.434
stacks of mostly general groceries, you know. Did 
the people of Rockville trade at the concert? No,

25:23.459 --> 25:24.881
no, not much. That is mostly the miners. But the 
miners did go into Rockville to... Oh, yes. Oh,

25:29.707 --> 25:30.748
yes. Because they didn't have to trade at the 
commissary. They wasn't forced to. It was just

25:35.624 --> 25:38.167
handy for them, see? It was just handy for them, and 
they could buy their groceries there and save them

25:38.187 --> 25:42.994
going into town, don't you see? And I believe the 
way they done that, too, a lot of times they could

25:44.956 --> 25:52.546
buy it, you know, and just take it out of their 
check, and they'd go to pay them, you know? You see

25:52.566 --> 25:54.168
what I mean? Were the prices higher in the 
commissary? A little bit. A little higher, yes.

25:57.473 --> 25:57.613
Uh-huh. I used to go over there at 12 o'clock to the 
Big Blunt commissary if I needed a pencil or a

25:58.640 --> 26:04.906
tablet or something from the schoolhouse. And of 
course, I'd pick me up a little candy or something

26:04.926 --> 26:07.188
too, you know. And right over here, like I said, I 
went over there with my daddy on the wagon loaded

26:07.968 --> 26:13.674
with those mining timbers. And I drank my red soda 
water and ate my candy. Yeah. Quite a lot. I can go

26:19.679 --> 26:21.801
right back through this road here, you know. See, 
it was just a frame. You took the bed off the wagon,

26:23.643 --> 26:27.246
you see, and you'd have to have just the frame, you 
know. to carry those big logs. I called them logs.

26:32.567 --> 26:37.294
And then when we went back, I could ride that back 
cupton pole and have fun, you know. You didn't help

26:39.277 --> 26:41.060
your dad unload them, did you? Oh, no. He unloaded 
them all by himself? Yes, he did. And then the

26:44.124 --> 26:47.028
miners themselves put the timber in there. Oh, 
that's right. They done that. Yeah. Do you know

26:51.915 --> 26:54.679
about how big the commissary was? The ones that I 
was in is... I balked a team. A mule would go this way

27:01.350 --> 27:02.732
and then this way. You ever see a team balk? One 
would fly back and the other would pull. The other

27:06.256 --> 27:07.458
would fly back and the other would pull. And Papa 
laughed. And the man looked around at him and took

27:08.660 --> 27:13.045
after him with a knife about that long. And, of 
course, Papa shouldn't have done it, but he was

27:13.065 --> 27:15.348
laughing. And he had to run. He run and he got into 
that story in that commissary and he went on

27:17.191 --> 27:20.795
upstairs, see? And the man was right after him. 
With the knife. With the knife. And there's a black

27:27.384 --> 27:28.485
man. come down and he says, stop right where you 
are. He had a pick in his hand. And my dad and you

27:34.715 --> 27:38.101
where they kept a pistol upstairs there, see, at 
that time. And that's what he's going to go after.

27:40.524 --> 27:42.007
But he didn't have to make it up there. The black man 
had the pick. But they picked Colway, you know.

27:45.292 --> 27:46.333
Told him, stop right there. And that ended it up. I 
said, Papa, you shouldn't have laughed at him.

27:49.919 --> 27:50.941
Well, he said it was funny. I had to laugh. That's a 
marvelous story. Yeah. Well, did you see any of the

27:57.457 --> 28:00.620
tools? Nothing but picks. Picks? Picks. You were 
talking about the hats yesterday. Oh, yeah.

28:05.566 --> 28:09.109
Little old caps, you know, with a carbide light 
that fit in on the front. Were they cloth hats or

28:09.190 --> 28:12.053
metal hats? No, they weren't metal. They were just 
cloth hats that would come around, you know, just

28:13.354 --> 28:16.457
to hold that. A little bill to it, you know. Little 
things set up there and give them a little dim

28:19.801 --> 28:22.083
light. Terrible work, all right. But they seemed 
to be happy.

28:30.278 --> 28:32.261
And there were no unions and no strikes? No, I don't 
think they were. I never heard of any trouble like

28:33.522 --> 28:35.165
that. And that cave in, that was on that slope mine, 
and Alvin mentioned that to me this morning. What,

28:41.553 --> 28:42.454
back in 1913? Something like that. And I had forgot 
about it. There might have been some more

28:46.820 --> 28:50.225
tragedies over there, but I can't remember. Well, 
I think that was the biggest tragedy. Yeah. Of

28:54.110 --> 28:55.071
course, I didn't know about it. this uh white man 
getting killed yeah yeah now somewhere in the 30s i

28:55.658 --> 29:10.748
think a guy crime or yes he did he got killed there 
one of those coal cars run over it was it being

28:55.658 --> 29:10.748
pulled
