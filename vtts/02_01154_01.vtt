WEBVTT

00:01.499 --> 00:10.290
we felt, at least I felt, that the public was not 
turned off on veterinary medicine, but they

00:01.499 --> 00:10.290
wasn't turned off. Yeah, just didn't. You know, 
they kind of accepted, you know, I got a vet down the

00:12.392 --> 00:25.228
street to treat my dog, but I doubt if we really, I 
don't think that we were appreciated in the

00:12.392 --> 00:25.228
proportions of what veterinarians sacrificed 
and getting the kind of education that they were

00:25.681 --> 00:29.386
beginning to get at that time. It was an expensive, 
long-term thing, highly scientific type thing. I

00:33.992 --> 00:40.420
appreciated that because I made a point to 
understand how these graduates are, what they're

00:33.992 --> 00:40.420
going through. So I really don't think the public, 
per se, really put the veterinarian up on a high

00:40.440 --> 00:47.329
plane. What we were struggling to do, excuse me, I 
think I might have thought in my heart that our

00:53.693 --> 01:01.782
image was 100% about love veterinarians, but I 
don't think they did, and I still don't think they

00:53.693 --> 01:01.782
did, and I don't think they do. But I think they have 
a great deal of respect, and I think enough to where

01:02.322 --> 01:14.416
the veterinary profession will survive on their 
reputation, because I think they've become

01:02.322 --> 01:14.416
better accepted. You have to look at veterinary 
medicine as one of those things that when you spend

01:14.436 --> 01:19.161
money with somebody, That's not the most pleasant 
thing. So I guess everybody, every type of

01:21.068 --> 01:26.940
practitioner, dentist, everybody else has got 
that little barrier there. But I think through

01:26.960 --> 01:34.855
some of the things that have been done, and 
hopefully I have a part of it, did improve the image

01:26.960 --> 01:34.855
and did make the veterinary more. to make people 
more aware of what they could do and the fact that

01:36.421 --> 01:46.011
they have as good an education as you can get. It's 
much harder to be a veterinarian in this position

01:46.031 --> 01:50.857
sometimes as far as getting into a school. I think 
people appreciate that. Do you think there was a

01:52.418 --> 02:04.571
tendency in post-World War II Texas, et cetera, to 
associate a veterinarian with rural farm

01:52.418 --> 02:04.571
pastimes? Absolutely. The veterinarian that 
came out of Texas A&M in 1950 and went to Houston, I

02:05.682 --> 02:18.719
can assure you he had a big selling job to do to make a 
living in that town, which must have been half the

02:05.682 --> 02:18.719
size it is today. But I mean, it was a very risky 
situation for a man to go to Houston in 1950 instead

02:19.059 --> 02:32.837
of practice, hoping they'd have enough pet owners 
that would appreciate the fact that their pets

02:19.059 --> 02:32.837
needed care. You know, the money in things began to 
pick up, too. People had more spendable income

02:36.942 --> 02:40.607
after that time. But to get back to your story, I 
think it was the image of veterinarian was the old

02:40.627 --> 02:50.698
general practitioner that pulled calves and... 
And we don't need him anymore. Right, yeah, I mean,

02:51.219 --> 02:53.061
I think it was that way. For a while, I could see 
where that could have developed. And I guarantee

02:55.524 --> 02:58.207
you, the first one I ever saw, I'll never forget 
him. My daddy used him to throw in some hogs. You

03:00.409 --> 03:02.672
know, he was one of those guys who worked 18 hours a 
day, several days a week, and he had a pretty darn

03:03.192 --> 03:11.603
cool facility operation. Most of them operated 
out of the pickup or out of an old hole in the wall.

03:15.989 --> 03:21.276
And posted all the animals down at the jump yard. 
Posted all the animals down at the... But anyway,

03:24.720 --> 03:25.802
yeah. Well, in that same token, could you comment 
broadly on the... I'd say the income, et cetera, of

03:31.323 --> 03:49.483
veterinarians, and also what the new competition 
of more and more vets in business was doing to

03:31.323 --> 03:49.483
income levels, et cetera, prices, competition 
within the profession, this kind of thing. I'm not

03:49.565 --> 03:53.974
sure, again, what I'm asking, except that how well 
are vets doing after World War II? And how are they

03:54.876 --> 03:55.818
doing now? And what's been the big problem 
economically for them? I really think the

03:58.964 --> 04:07.742
veterinarian always made more money than, let's 
say, the graduate we went into, let's say,

04:08.127 --> 04:09.730
teaching or something like that. Okay, that's a 
good index. In other words, they're probably

04:10.932 --> 04:14.437
doing better than the teacher or the county agent, 
say. Yeah, the county agent. They're working

04:15.839 --> 04:16.561
hard. I would say they were doing, I hate to use 
percentage figures, I would say they were doing

04:16.641 --> 04:24.914
20-30% better than what you could earn on a salary. 
So they're getting a professional income. Right.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.485
And of course they had some overhead and some risk. 
And one of the good things that happened The

04:33.457 --> 04:39.164
veterinarians, through their investing in the 
real estate, also reap a side benefit. One in

04:39.264 --> 04:47.734
Houston soon found that the location of clinics in 
certain places is a good investment. In other

04:47.754 --> 04:52.680
words, they can make it go, they can hold on to it and 
make a living or maybe hire somebody to run it. But

04:52.700 --> 04:56.865
more importantly, it might be worth more in 
development as development. or in a good place

04:57.183 --> 05:01.289
where it would be brought out for a shopping 
center. That wasn't necessarily nearly as true,

05:01.309 --> 05:06.697
of course, and probably not at all true in the rural 
communities. But some of them did accumulate some

05:07.118 --> 05:13.788
pretty fine buildings and some pretty good 
equipment and some good locations. And some of

05:14.909 --> 05:24.203
them, you know, accumulated some land with them in 
the case of the rural practitioners and kind of

05:14.909 --> 05:24.203
mid-city type people. Yeah, I would say the 
veterinarian always did better, and there was

05:24.757 --> 05:34.831
always a little bit of professional jealousy, I 
think, between the professional agriculturist

05:24.757 --> 05:34.831
and the professional veterinarian. Oh, and that 
could have been part of it. I think it might have

05:37.335 --> 05:41.521
been. But I would say the veterinarian was always, 
you know, he worked hard, had a good location, good

05:41.541 --> 05:54.679
attitude, good management, good support from his 
family and his staff, you know, he always did okay.

05:59.923 --> 06:00.964
But they're hard workers. They open that door 
every morning at 6.30 and they close it every night

06:00.984 --> 06:05.652
at 6.30 or 5.30 or whatever. So you have to know that 
they're working probably 20, 30 percent harder

06:06.093 --> 06:13.685
and a lot harder and more hours, 20, 30 percent more 
hours. But they had their own business and they had

06:13.705 --> 06:17.511
incentives there being in their business. Okay, 
now in the 60s or in the boom period, when you start

06:18.166 --> 06:28.296
producing 100 new vets a year, what's happening to 
the income levels? I think the income level came

06:28.396 --> 06:32.100
right on. It'll hold because of growth in society, 
affluent. You know, on the dollars that we had in

06:35.784 --> 06:47.295
the late 60s and early 70s, let's use a comparison 
and don't hold me to it as an actual, but let's say a

06:35.784 --> 06:47.295
person in the late 60s and early 70s was grossing, 
let's say, $20,000. I mean netting $20,000 out of a

06:50.212 --> 06:55.600
hospital. Maybe he grossed $100,000, $75,000, 
whatever it takes. But he was netting a bit. I think

07:00.668 --> 07:09.861
by the middle 70s and the early 80s that you were 
talking about $35,000, $70,000 and on up. But the

07:10.221 --> 07:11.804
dollars changed. Yeah, sure. I would say... I 
would say that there were not very many

07:15.878 --> 07:27.932
veterinarians that were not netting $35,000, 
$40,000 in the years that, in the latter years, I

07:15.878 --> 07:27.932
was there, in the late 70s, early 80s. I would say 
that there were plenty of them netting a whole lot

07:27.952 --> 07:31.256
more than that. Yeah, well, that's a good index. A 
hundred grand, and there were a lot of large animal

07:32.417 --> 07:37.904
practitioners that worked hard, that had people 
working for them. Of course, you had a lot of the

07:37.924 --> 07:40.667
multiple practices started coming in. You're 
talking about the expansion? Yeah. Other

07:42.473 --> 07:43.094
students? Well, that also was reflected in the 
multiple practice situation. You had a guy that

07:46.899 --> 07:50.204
was one veterinarian at one location. Suddenly 
there was two veterinarians. Suddenly there was

07:52.107 --> 07:53.048
three veterinarians. Doing different things, 
servicing different groups. Or sometimes the

07:55.972 --> 08:01.601
veterinarians were going and putting in a 
satellite clinic. And it's the best thing that

08:02.061 --> 08:03.904
happened in Houston. It happened in a lot of larger 
towns. And then there was another concept that

08:06.588 --> 08:09.592
came along that helped. And that is the concept of 
the emergency clinics. After hours clinic. A lot

08:15.052 --> 08:19.138
of those people were absorbed into that time and 
still are many. A city like San Antonio, Houston

08:19.198 --> 08:24.587
might have a half a dozen emergency clinics for 
people after hours to go to. And so those people

08:25.749 --> 08:28.513
were absorbed in that county. It was a new concept 
in veterinary service in the, started about, I

08:28.533 --> 08:34.702
guess, early mid-70s. You never, ever saw a 
veterinary emergency clinic. No, I never even

08:37.867 --> 08:39.610
heard of it. But lately I've been watching and I see 
them. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a good concept. It's a

08:43.892 --> 08:44.873
good service. And it's another way to absorb some 
practitioners. Now, when a young vet comes out of

08:48.677 --> 08:54.263
A&M, has there been any change in how they go into 
business? Say, in the early 60s when you started

08:54.884 --> 09:00.230
out, were most of these people just hanging out at 
their shingle? Or were they associating

09:00.610 --> 09:04.735
themselves with someone already in practice? And 
did that change over time? I think you saw a lot of

09:06.777 --> 09:10.041
shoestring operations where people just... they 
opened up with a mental amount of capital and kind

09:10.493 --> 09:17.021
of holding a wall type of concept. But I think you 
saw that change between, let's say, 65 and

09:17.041 --> 09:27.153
certainly by 1980, that the veterinarians, young 
veterinarians, were willing to take more risk. In

09:27.353 --> 09:31.618
other words, they went and they borrowed big money 
from big financial... Set up, okay. And set up, a

09:31.638 --> 09:37.045
lot of times, almost immediately went into their 
own freestanding buildings. Of course, Houston,

09:37.105 --> 09:38.847
the largest city, You couldn't do that near 
Muscovy, but you could always get in the shopping

09:39.316 --> 09:44.804
center or a strip center or something like that. 
And some of them went into these kind of things. But

09:46.967 --> 09:56.562
you didn't see, oh, you saw a few that went to the 
cities in those 50s and 60s time, and some of them

09:46.967 --> 09:56.562
before my time, but I can see what they did after I 
came. Put in their own freestanding buildings,

09:56.582 --> 10:03.732
very small buildings, looking for location more 
than anything. And then they added to them. They

10:05.335 --> 10:08.800
added associates, and they added partners. You 
find people that started a partnership that broke

10:09.252 --> 10:13.158
away from each other. This one went to this part of 
town. This one went to large animal only. This one

10:16.422 --> 10:18.145
went to small animal only. These kind of 
partnerships you saw. And then all it did was just

10:20.709 --> 10:30.082
multiply itself because there again you get 
another clinic, another practitioner serving

10:20.709 --> 10:30.082
another clientele. And he adds people, 
veterinarians to his business. It's a little

10:33.427 --> 10:34.108
smaller. A good example of that is Tremere's. 
Tremere's practice. He used to be associated in

10:37.957 --> 10:40.921
general practice when they went in in the 50s. You 
know, everybody was a general practitioner.

10:42.464 --> 10:43.485
Sure, yeah, did everything. If you didn't go to 
Houston or Dallas, you were a general

10:43.505 --> 10:47.811
practitioner. See, and I had a talk at that 
luncheon, at that academy luncheon, with a guy in

10:47.831 --> 10:57.065
Dallas, I believe. I should have brought my list 
with me, but he's a heart specialist, I believe.

11:00.870 --> 11:03.534
And he has four or five specialists with him, and 
that's all they do. They service, apparently, the

11:03.594 --> 11:07.660
other clinics. Well, that was another concept 
that came along after the middle 70s was the

11:07.690 --> 11:19.246
specialty surgery kind of thing, specialty 
dermatology clinics, and these kind of things.

11:19.266 --> 11:21.068
And they'd get referrals, like you say. Take the 
average practitioner that just didn't have the

11:21.088 --> 11:29.880
equipment nor perhaps the expertise to do back 
surgery on a dog. Well, Herman Dietrich comes to my

11:30.041 --> 11:32.484
mind. He went into specialty surgery. Very 
brilliant person. And I You know, he kind of had his

11:37.154 --> 11:43.744
own little ego, but he could do anything with 
surgical procedures. Very respected. In fact, he

11:44.525 --> 11:48.731
burned out just being a dog and cat doctor. That was 
below his intelligence, and I don't mean that

11:48.831 --> 11:52.396
complimentary. Yeah, I understand. So he and then 
we had other people went into dermatology and

11:54.038 --> 12:03.432
heart work, and I'm sure there's some I'm missing 
out on that we also found. The general

12:04.222 --> 12:07.767
practitioner began to become a specialist too. We 
had people who still do. They make circuits. They

12:11.472 --> 12:17.421
go on berries in Wise County, another one in Parker 
County, another one in Wichita County. Their home

12:17.441 --> 12:20.986
base might be in San Antonio. Let me ask you a couple 
of other general questions about the development

12:21.026 --> 12:27.715
of the, you might say, the vet economy. One is, did 
you see, or had it already occurred, a balance, a

12:28.420 --> 12:39.152
change in the balance, let's say, between large 
animal and small animal practice or income into

12:28.420 --> 12:39.152
the profession between 65 and 83? Was it marked? 
Oh, very definitely. I think you just have to say

12:41.715 --> 12:49.905
that, and the way you prove that up is that, you 
know, when you look at the graduates, where do they

12:41.715 --> 12:49.905
go? Okay, I'll get those statistics. That's a good 
thing to pursue. I've had a practitioner tell me,

12:55.349 --> 13:02.997
and he built a special place that people come and 
intern with him in his general practice in South

12:55.349 --> 13:02.997
Texas. And he built a dormitory type thing at his 
clinic where people come and stay at his expense of

13:03.858 --> 13:12.267
housing them. And the intern, he tells me that some 
years he doesn't get a call. People are going into

13:16.972 --> 13:18.053
it. other types of practice, and there's nothing 
wrong with those kind of practices. Small animal,

13:22.121 --> 13:33.656
they want to go to the city, they want to go to the 
country, they want to go to specialty practices,

13:22.121 --> 13:33.656
they want to go to teaching, research, and that 
sort of thing. So I think you've seen, I bet if you

13:33.676 --> 13:44.351
put a reading on it, you probably can tell by 
looking at association records, I wouldn't be

13:33.676 --> 13:44.351
surprised if it was certainly at least 
two-thirds, one-third. I think it's two-thirds

13:44.691 --> 13:47.415
small animal and one-third other. Okay. And a 
pretty good index of that is simply where they're

13:48.480 --> 13:51.363
domiciled. In other words, those people in the 
city are going to be small animals, basically.

13:53.905 --> 13:54.766
That's right. You'll see some GPs there. Sure. 
Horse people. Yeah. And you'll see it'll be mostly

13:58.770 --> 14:07.499
small animals because the population pretty well 
dictates what professions go where. Yeah.

14:08.741 --> 14:14.106
There's more venison here than there are in 
Austin, if you might look at the numbers. But,

14:14.847 --> 14:15.968
yeah. It is, and it is a considerable problem. I 
think there's still an adequate number of general

14:19.858 --> 14:24.827
practitioners, you know. The rancher may not 
think that, but, you know, a general

14:24.887 --> 14:31.578
practitioner's got to get over here, too. Yeah, 
sure. And he works hard. He's got to do it over

14:34.703 --> 14:36.867
hours. So, you know, you like to have one on every 
elbow when you want it. Yeah, right. That cost,

14:41.543 --> 14:42.364
too. Now, in that same general line, in the 
changing complexion of the profession, let's

14:43.025 --> 14:50.456
say, women are coming in when you start out. How has 
this affected or impacted on the income levels and

14:50.516 --> 14:58.948
profiles? The reason I ask is I've heard some 
grousing. Well, you know, I've been away from it

15:02.287 --> 15:06.411
for about five, six years now. I don't know if it's 
like it was then, but let me tell you what I sensed at

15:06.431 --> 15:21.526
the time, and I think it's probably a true thing, 
that even though you've got 50% of the graduates

15:06.431 --> 15:21.526
that are women, you know, you don't necessarily 
have that reflected in practice. No, it's not.

15:22.427 --> 15:24.309
That's right. Most of them are not what you call 
the... owner-manager type situation. They work

15:31.251 --> 15:38.178
for somebody else, they have husbands, and they 
have secondary income for the family. And also,

15:38.759 --> 15:44.585
that also reflected in the participation in the 
professional association. I could sense that we

15:44.746 --> 15:51.713
were not getting the women into the association 
numbers that we were getting the men in. One reason

15:51.733 --> 15:55.277
was that they were not the part and that they worked 
for other people. They were not on the salaries

15:58.590 --> 16:04.075
that made the income maybe that some of their peers 
did. And I sensed that. And I think if you look at the

16:06.577 --> 16:13.583
membership and the attrition that they've had 
with the graduates in the last 10 years, you'd see

16:06.577 --> 16:13.583
that. I haven't looked at it, but I think you might. 
But see, there's another side of that too. The fact

16:20.209 --> 16:24.353
that there are 50% women graduating out of the 
class it doesn't overrun the profession quite as

16:24.772 --> 16:29.299
strongly as if they were all men. That's right. 
Okay, so you're getting a lot more bodies out

16:31.903 --> 16:39.054
there, but really less product or competition or 
whatever you want to call it. You're not near the

16:39.074 --> 16:43.461
numbers of practitioners that it would be if they 
were all male. Now, that's based on my experience.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.989
It's based on a little bit of philosophy. Yeah, 
well, I was curious about that because I've heard,

16:49.009 --> 16:53.496
well, one side of it was that Women are coming out 
and competing, and they're not setting up shop,

16:53.932 --> 17:01.644
and they don't have all these expenses, and 
they're, in effect, flooding the market or

16:53.932 --> 17:01.644
something. You know, that was the implication. 
But what you're saying is really totally

17:03.287 --> 17:06.872
different, in a way. I think that's true. I'm sure 
there's some of the other that goes on, too. Well,

17:11.043 --> 17:20.699
let's face it, if we could get good women to come in 
and practice long hours just like the men, I mean, I

17:11.043 --> 17:20.699
have no problem with that philosophically or 
anything else. But I think, as a practical matter,

17:20.980 --> 17:24.846
it just doesn't work in the same proportion. The 
women working in this particular gate, the men in

17:24.927 --> 17:35.785
another one, have different motivations, 
different

17:24.927 --> 17:35.785
demands. Let's face it, my wife doesn't make as 
much money as I do, but she has a job. It's very

17:39.896 --> 17:42.582
important that you have one. And I think that's 
going to be true, and the woman veterinarian, she

17:42.602 --> 17:52.103
may not make, and I don't think there's much in the 
plan to go in and be a preparer. So that would be the

17:52.336 --> 17:55.439
key in the difference. I'm going to. I'm going to 
follow up on all this with Grinchow and Al Price and

17:56.440 --> 18:01.185
so forth. Because I think it's interesting. I 
think this is kind of some of the key to

18:03.348 --> 18:06.932
understanding what's going on in the world. And 
hopefully the book will be of some value to people

18:07.052 --> 18:11.577
because we can at least expose these questions. I 
don't want to answer them. Well, I think, yeah,

18:13.379 --> 18:15.661
right. Better economics is a very important side 
of the whole thing. That's really what we're

18:19.045 --> 18:21.347
talking about in a sense. But it's very 
interesting

18:22.407 --> 18:30.576
to be able to see what I've been able to see. Well, 
the nice thing about you right now, and that's why I

18:30.596 --> 18:38.264
was so anxious to get with you early on, is now you 
can step back and look at it from a different

18:30.596 --> 18:38.264
perspective. When you're in the middle of it, your 
world view is not the same at all. Be more

18:42.829 --> 18:43.570
objective. That's right. But it's a good 
profession. It's one that I enjoyed being with

18:47.614 --> 18:50.457
when I was there. Well, I would think so. And I would 
think, again, that the public estimation of

18:51.601 --> 18:59.470
veterinary medicine is probably going to 
increase. I think under the influence of, call it

18:59.730 --> 19:11.404
what you will, environmentalism, conservation, 
all that kind of thing, really does have an

18:59.730 --> 19:11.404
animal-human dimension to it. And that could be 
worked to the advantage of the profession. Let me

19:14.849 --> 19:16.050
tell you another consideration. You look at the 
young married couples right now. that are coming

19:20.812 --> 19:30.607
up, and they have a very, very, very much higher 
regard for their pets and their animals than they

19:20.812 --> 19:30.607
did a guy that's my age now that's middle-aged. Oh 
yeah, when I came out, man, we wouldn't spend a

19:30.627 --> 19:34.432
nickel on an animal because it's not worth it. You 
can go get another one. Yeah, that's right. But I

19:36.175 --> 19:41.503
tell you what, the daughters and sons that I 
raised, don't you think that they're going to let

19:36.175 --> 19:41.503
those animals suffer? There's two things for it, 
that they were brought up, I think, in caring

19:41.855 --> 19:52.267
families that stressed, you know, and the school 
stressed the human treatment of animals and

19:41.855 --> 19:52.267
things like that. And animal became sort of a, as 
you say, a bond to the human side of things. You've

19:57.813 --> 20:00.356
got an appreciation for that. And, of course, 
people have dollars to spend that we didn't have,

20:00.376 --> 20:07.303
you know, at that time. But you've got a different 
public out there now. You've got a different

20:10.106 --> 20:11.608
clientele. I think that's going to certainly work 
in the favor of the practitioner. It doesn't

20:17.256 --> 20:31.073
necessarily reflect itself in the general 
practitioner, because it's a game of economics

20:17.256 --> 20:31.073
with cattle and animals and even horses that are 
traded in commerce and hogs. So you can't quite put

20:31.233 --> 20:33.936
that same thing on it. But let me say this. The 
people that are carrying those animals, horses,

20:35.097 --> 20:38.862
cattle, hogs, a much more fluent society too. They 
know that there are things in science that can be

20:41.232 --> 20:47.829
done to animals that maybe my daddy didn't 
appreciate. God bless him, he was struggling. He

20:49.574 --> 20:51.800
ate kids. Perhaps even myself. Let me ask you some, 
I'm going to close you out pretty soon, I know

20:53.978 --> 21:12.320
you're getting tired, but several other 
dimensions of that practice, I guess, is what

20:53.978 --> 21:12.320
would you say were some of the major problems that 
you sensed confronting the industry? The

21:13.762 --> 21:14.883
profession you mean? Yeah, the profession. While 
I was there, you mean? Yeah. Or even today, just

21:17.401 --> 21:20.345
random ideas. Well, of course, I always think of 
the things that we did and the things we reacted to.

21:24.511 --> 21:30.299
Of course, you know, education was one of those 
things we tried to help solve through the academy.

21:30.319 --> 21:36.748
We also fought real hard to keep another 
veterinary school from being put in the state of

21:30.319 --> 21:36.748
Texas Tech. Okay, why did you fight it? We fought it 
because of two things. One, we didn't think that

21:40.621 --> 21:48.431
the state would be willing over the long haul to 
support two quality institutions in Texas. And I

21:48.451 --> 21:55.120
tell you what, if we had those two right now, we'd be 
hurting, because I understand the Texas A&M is

21:48.451 --> 21:55.120
serving for money right now. In fact, they might 
even be on probation if they don't get some more

21:55.140 --> 22:01.388
money for certain things that they need to do down 
there. But that was, of course, and I guess we may

22:01.408 --> 22:04.973
have had some selfish motives, too. Everybody 
thought, well, you know, we don't need that many

22:04.993 --> 22:08.358
more veterinarians. We've already... expanded 
at A&M to a trimester system. We're already

22:12.130 --> 22:13.672
doubling the enrollment. Of course, we did that in 
the face of threat. I don't think we would have

22:17.997 --> 22:24.706
doubled the enrollment if we'd been rocking long, 
free, and easy on what was going on. That's a good

22:26.008 --> 22:29.672
thing, and I know this is kind of a sensitive area, I 
guess. Does the TVMA...

22:29.752 --> 22:38.944
What kind of relationship do you have with the vet 
school in terms, say, of... of influencing

22:39.734 --> 22:44.060
decisions relating to admissions, etc. Well, you 
know, I'd be quite right. The medical association

22:46.283 --> 22:56.798
has always thought of as controlling admission to 
medical schools as essentially a sort of a union

22:46.283 --> 22:56.798
card. Do you sense that at all? Well, I think we 
certainly have that impression that that

22:59.381 --> 23:04.268
association had a lot of influence on the card. I 
think they listened to us a lot. Well, I have to give

23:06.110 --> 23:09.894
Al Price credit for the fact that he ran a pretty 
tight ship. He set up standards that you couldn't

23:10.074 --> 23:13.437
penetrate. You know, I mean, it wasn't this old, 
good old boy, you know, I'm going to get your boy in

23:13.457 --> 23:19.183
where he's qualified. Not that thing. I bet that 
pressure would be big. We're going to quit

23:22.426 --> 23:25.149
teaching this, and we're going to start teaching 
that. He, you know, give him credit for that, and I

23:25.269 --> 23:29.393
think that has carried on. I think they've built a 
good, solid reason to say, you know, these are

23:29.654 --> 23:35.880
things that are good for teaching. Professions 
should support these things. Of course, Dave, I

23:38.847 --> 23:58.813
think when the profession says, and the 
association says, well, we need more emphasis on

23:38.847 --> 23:58.813
equine medicine, more emphasis on felon 
medicine, or more emphasis on specialization,

23:38.847 --> 23:58.813
teaching small animal practitioners to do more of 
this and less of that, we need more on veterinary

23:59.148 --> 24:02.133
economics about how to run a practice. I think 
they're sensitive to things like that. Boy, I

24:04.036 --> 24:05.859
think they still need that, don't they? Aren't 
they beginning to move in that direction a little

24:05.899 --> 24:08.043
bit? Yeah, I don't think it'd be hard to overdo 
that. Of course, the cricket is always full of

24:10.748 --> 24:12.771
time. Yeah, I know, they don't have time. But, you 
know, one limiting factor, and I think most

24:14.274 --> 24:22.287
veterinarians will admit, that they're not 
really natural-born business people. No,

24:22.368 --> 24:23.629
they're not. Most doctors are not, period. They 
don't have a good staff or a good wife or a good

24:25.752 --> 24:33.841
somebody to come in there and tell them how much 
you're spending and how much you're bringing in.

24:33.901 --> 24:38.647
They're never so busy out here hitting the road or 
doing surgery that they don't know what's going

24:33.901 --> 24:38.647
on. I'm going to follow that up because that's a 
good opportunity for both business and medical

24:38.667 --> 24:44.173
and... That practice is to work out a program. We 
don't have that program. I teach economic and

24:48.486 --> 24:49.888
business history. That's why I'm kind of 
interested in that. Oh, do you? You still teach

24:53.351 --> 24:54.673
some? Yeah. So I'm kind of interested in that. 
That's one thing I wanted to do that I got lost in the

24:56.515 --> 24:59.758
business profession. I never get back to get a 
master's degree to do some teaching. Never too

25:02.621 --> 25:03.322
late. It's kind of hard, but it's never too late. 
So... Would you comment just again in very broad

25:10.428 --> 25:17.297
terms on your relations with the A&M School of 
Veterinary Medicine? Well, you know, Henry, I

25:17.317 --> 25:25.468
took on probably a little bit different image than 
maybe the guy that succeeded me or maybe even the

25:17.317 --> 25:25.468
guy that's there now. You know, A&M was my school. 
Okay, yeah, sure. And I roomed with veterinarians

25:29.973 --> 25:32.276
when I went to school. I had a national 
appreciation for that in my agricultural

25:32.417 --> 25:36.742
background. But, you know, I broke my back to do 
everything I could. In fact, You know, I was there

25:40.702 --> 25:45.046
when we created the Veterinary Medical 
Diagnostic Laboratory. Okay. That's another one

25:45.467 --> 25:48.310
of the legislative things that we did during my 
tenure. Yeah, that's a good point. And I felt so

25:50.732 --> 25:56.038
good about it because, first of all, my people 
needed it, and I was doing something for my school.

25:56.058 --> 25:56.158
Yeah. And I guess I'm a little sentimental about 
that. But, you know, I would do anything for the

26:00.382 --> 26:05.427
veterinary school and Texas A&M. It was natural. 
Yeah, okay. But I'll tell you, there was a mutual

26:08.530 --> 26:12.136
respect in those guys. They respected what I was 
trying to do. I certainly respected them. I called

26:16.522 --> 26:18.145
shots on them. And so consequently, it was kind of 
romantic. Yeah. And would you say that still

26:21.129 --> 26:22.972
holds, pretty much? Well, you know, I don't know. 
Like I said, after I left, I think different people

26:24.214 --> 26:27.860
have different feelings. I'm sort of a 
sentimental person. But I still think, that they

26:32.744 --> 26:35.007
know the importance of veterinary school. 
They've got to go in and input as much as they can and

26:35.027 --> 26:41.914
support the school through the association, with 
the association, vice versa. And I don't know how

26:41.934 --> 26:47.080
much of that continues, but I know it has to be. It 
just has to be. But that's the way you get things

26:48.942 --> 26:51.225
done. It's cooperation. I couldn't sense or see 
any problems or think of anything, but I was just

26:52.426 --> 26:56.911
wondering. I don't know either, and I certainly 
wasn't that way when I was there. I'm hoping. I

27:00.368 --> 27:08.898
don't think it would be a very, very serious 
problem on any dean's part to completely ignore

27:00.368 --> 27:08.898
the profession and association that represents 
it. And it would certainly be stupid on the part of

27:08.918 --> 27:18.830
the association not to understand the real need 
and what the college is doing to support

27:08.918 --> 27:18.830
everything that they possibly can. We're in this 
thing together. Yeah, absolutely. I'll follow

27:22.213 --> 27:25.177
that up with Price, too. I've always liked him. 
He'll tell me the way it is. I have a feeling. I

27:29.697 --> 27:32.703
guarantee.

27:33.925 --> 27:42.521
Okay, so general problems I was concerned with and 
your relationships with the veterinary medicine

27:33.925 --> 27:42.521
schools, school of veterinary medicine. Okay, 
what about relationships with other state

27:42.581 --> 27:51.317
associations and organizations that are 
somewhat in your ballpark? Right. Well, we always

27:51.891 --> 28:04.329
were brought together in that area because the 
American Veterinary Association always brought

27:51.891 --> 28:04.329
the constituent associations in every so often to 
talk about what the AVMA was doing. Of course, we

28:04.349 --> 28:08.555
had separate memberships and the views were not, 
it wasn't a federation type. Yeah. And at that

28:09.537 --> 28:15.245
time, we also got our different state executives 
together to kind of talk over our own little

28:09.537 --> 28:15.245
problem. We had an aid for that where we sit down and 
talk about running associations. Did you usually

28:20.366 --> 28:22.869
go to the AVMA meetings? Always. Did a pretty good 
delegation go with you usually, or from Texas?

28:30.319 --> 28:35.045
Well, you know, we went to two different groups, 
Henry. I would go to a constituent meeting where

28:35.246 --> 28:41.734
they were strictly talking what AVMA was trying to 
do in the past. And then we would go to the annual

28:41.875 --> 28:45.840
convention where we were trying to get ABMA to do 
what our particular state wanted them to do. We

28:50.298 --> 28:51.720
took a delegation there. We'd always take two 
voting delegates and the president. And I would go

28:55.685 --> 29:01.473
along and kind of advise on the resolution that we 
were trying to pass. We were always interested in

29:01.493 --> 29:08.503
the way that the ABMA distributed its voting 
weight of its vote. compared to numbers. We were

29:09.994 --> 29:12.918
always on the short end of the stick. We had more 
numbers and less weight. You voted two delegates,

29:15.462 --> 29:22.131
although our region might have had three times the 
numbers they had in New England. So we were always

29:22.151 --> 29:24.834
fighting for things like that. And we were 
fighting for things that the council, the various

29:25.135 --> 29:28.720
councils were doing. They had counsel on 
everything, from small animal medicine to

29:28.740 --> 29:35.569
specialty practices. We were always trying to get 
them into things that were You know, we were into

29:38.251 --> 29:40.294
it. Did you have any formal or informal 
affiliations with some of the breeder

29:40.314 --> 29:48.986
associations in Texas, say, or just general 
American breeder associations? Cattle or

29:49.227 --> 29:50.188
whatever? Not really. You know, usually we were 
invited to, but I was invited. That could be

29:56.016 --> 29:58.039
burdensome, I guess, after all. Texas 
Southwestern Cattle Records, for instance. They

30:01.235 --> 30:05.160
always invited me and my friends to their annual 
meeting. The Texas Farm Bureau, they would invite

30:05.220 --> 30:09.285
me since I was a former employer, they used to 
invite me. Did you go? Oh, yes. I go very

30:11.548 --> 30:13.510
frequently. I always have one every time. Did you 
tend to use the Farm Bureau, for example, as a forum

30:15.993 --> 30:24.323
for promulgating what veterinary medicine 
was... doing at all? Did you have that

30:25.804 --> 30:26.926
opportunity? Well, not really, but I think we 
always kept, it was an ear, you know. What we did

30:32.274 --> 30:42.830
more than that, and I got into it long towards the 
end of my career with the association, that we met

30:32.274 --> 30:42.830
with what they call the Texas Agricultural 
Council. Okay. Every commodity group that is in

30:43.952 --> 30:52.265
the state, plus that's all your cattle raisers, 
and they weren't breeding groups, they were

30:43.952 --> 30:52.265
commodity groups. Yeah. Cattle people, grain 
people, cotton people, milk people, you name it.

30:59.574 --> 31:01.437
We still have that.

31:03.439 --> 31:11.470
I was not as active in veterinary medicine, but I 
began to get into it because I realized that we had

31:03.439 --> 31:11.470
to have the agricultural community aware of what 
we're doing. That was the thing that almost

31:11.530 --> 31:15.635
wrecked the practice act last time. The 
agricultural community became suspicious that

31:15.655 --> 31:22.744
veterinary medicine was trying to encroach on 
some areas that they'd always thought was their

31:15.655 --> 31:22.744
territory. Embryo transfer. Pregnancy testing. 
And actually and truly, when they rewrote the

31:28.592 --> 31:33.380
Practice Act, we had people in the agriculture 
community. By that time, I was over in the

31:33.400 --> 31:35.944
agriculture community. I was out of the 
veterinary community. You know, attacking their

31:37.806 --> 31:42.394
Practice Act in areas that had always been covered 
in the Practice Act. So I convinced the

31:42.614 --> 31:49.845
agriculture community that, you know, why don't 
you look at what they're trying to change that

31:42.614 --> 31:49.845
encroaches but let's leave alone the things that 
they've already got. I mean, that's not, to me,

31:52.801 --> 31:55.865
that's being a little bit picky. You know, we can 
kill them. Our community can kill them on anything

31:57.307 --> 32:00.351
we want it to. You've got the clout. I said, let's 
leave the practice act alone, except in those

32:01.653 --> 32:11.527
areas that they're trying to go into that we feel 
like we question, or that we have a right to input

32:01.653 --> 32:11.527
on. And consequently, I think I was kind of the 
peacemaker, even though There were a few that knew

32:16.117 --> 32:19.622
this, and I wouldn't try to make it public. But I 
didn't get paid for it. I didn't ask for it. But I had

32:22.266 --> 32:24.509
enough respect for the people. Well, that makes 
your world easier, too. I had enough respect for

32:26.312 --> 32:31.880
the people that were trying to do this because they 
were my former leaders. I had enough respect for

32:32.441 --> 32:36.326
their customers to understand their side of the 
problem. But I was sort of a mediator, a referee,

32:36.346 --> 32:43.977
and I was glad I could play that role. What about 
relations with other states? associations,

32:46.019 --> 32:48.523
Oklahoma, Louisiana, et cetera. For example, 
when I was raised in Louisiana, every vet came to

32:48.543 --> 32:53.310
Texas A&M. Well, we had a lot closer relation with 
Louisiana for that reason, because we had quite a

32:53.911 --> 32:57.778
few graduates. So we had joint meetings with 
Louisiana on a number of occasions. Oh, is that

33:00.943 --> 33:01.724
right? We met in New Orleans one time. We met in 
Houston a couple of times, I believe it was. But we

33:09.015 --> 33:12.060
felt a lot closer to them, We had a lot of friends. 
What was your attitude in opening the vet school in

33:14.345 --> 33:18.831
Louisiana? Were you still involved? I was here 
then. I don't think it was any sentiment. I think we

33:27.962 --> 33:34.510
were kind of glad because at that time we had more 
students over here than we could place. In those 8

33:34.530 --> 33:38.134
or 10 or 12 spots that they had, we had an agreement 
to come back. We had to give them. I think the

33:39.209 --> 33:41.652
college felt relieved. We were along with 
college. I don't think anybody thought that that

33:45.056 --> 33:50.582
was a threat to numbers or anything. We were more 
concerned with another college in the state. In

33:54.887 --> 34:01.495
Oklahoma, we had very little association with. We 
had a few graduates that went up there. We had a few

34:03.437 --> 34:06.280
graduates from up there that came down here. We 
went through a situation in the late and early 80s

34:06.766 --> 34:17.326
where a lot of the people from the other states 
became involved in leadership roles in the

34:06.766 --> 34:17.326
association. It was an A&M bill. Yeah, right. And 
we had various ones to be credited. I think when I

34:23.217 --> 34:29.770
left there, we probably had over 50% non-A&M 
graduates on the executive board. Oh, is that

34:30.188 --> 34:30.929
right? That's interesting. I had no idea. I think 
that's reason it fired me. Oh, is it? You're not

34:36.477 --> 34:38.279
going to put that in the record? Could be, you know. 
Could be. But, you know, we were trying. We were

34:44.388 --> 34:48.694
trying to not be just an A&M deal. Yeah, yeah. I 
think it was the right way to go to get to the other

34:49.915 --> 34:54.582
states, but we were getting more and more. Yeah, 
sure. And apparently we were from Oklahoma,

34:59.838 --> 35:07.487
Missouri, Alabama, Auburn, and those states. We 
had a few Kansas graduates. Well, they're not very

35:10.591 --> 35:13.154
in California. Florida got a school after 
Louisiana did, so it was really an influx of... So

35:17.319 --> 35:21.824
it just reflects the growth of tax people coming 
from all over the country about that time. And we

35:21.844 --> 35:27.431
had a few Pennsylvania graduates, people like 
that. It was... I don't know what it is now. I think

35:31.058 --> 35:37.164
they're probably back to about two-thirds Texas 
and one-third other now. What about, say,

35:38.145 --> 35:44.531
problems with other state veterinary practice 
acts? Was there any conflict, or did you run into

35:44.571 --> 35:46.933
anything like that? Well, the thing I remember, 
Henry, more than anything else is that the closer

35:48.154 --> 35:56.322
bi-states seem to kind of guard guard their 
territory like that. People in New Mexico wasn't

35:58.883 --> 36:06.311
real crazy about the guy from Texas getting a 
license in New Mexico because he was a potential

35:58.883 --> 36:06.311
competitor. He'd come across the line. I read some 
literature in the Correspond. I don't remember

36:10.476 --> 36:11.698
the circumstances. Some people from Texas, they 
were practicing in New Mexico without being

36:12.239 --> 36:16.063
licensed in New Mexico. That kind of stuff. And 
vice versa, probably. They made it pretty tough.

36:19.567 --> 36:24.233
But what they finally did is kind of got together on 
some terms and said, hey, you know, We won't shut

36:25.040 --> 36:27.623
you out if you want to shut us out. We're not going to 
take you just on a written test. We want you to come

36:31.988 --> 36:35.492
over and take a practical test. So they set up a 
standard, and I think what they were trying to do

36:35.513 --> 36:42.501
was certainly try to keep outlaws out. If you've 
got somebody that can't practice in your own

36:42.521 --> 36:47.006
state, you have to worry about them a little bit. 
Why do you want to come over here? I don't think that

36:49.549 --> 36:51.171
was... I think it was certainly an issue that was 
out there, But it wasn't the biggest thing that was

36:54.689 --> 37:04.281
out

36:54.689 --> 37:04.281
there. Well, I guess that's the main thread of 
thought. We always supported the examining

37:08.185 --> 37:12.250
board, too, the regulatory body. We tried to put 
our people on there, and we did. In fact, that's

37:15.014 --> 37:24.325
another whole area I want to follow up, not with you 
right now, but is the public health dimension of

37:15.014 --> 37:24.325
veterinary medicine. How about Mexico? Just any 
brief comment on the... Mexico? Yeah, we were

37:28.696 --> 37:32.162
talking about, you know, other states, but 
there's another big problem, possibly. Yeah, we

37:32.322 --> 37:33.364
used to... The Academy used to go to Mexico for 
seminars and work with the Mexicans down there and

37:33.384 --> 37:40.798
joint seminar work. And, you know, that's a whole 
other world down there. At the time I was there, we

37:43.623 --> 37:45.807
always sort of uh agreed that they were probably in 
the 1940s down there yeah in the 1980s yeah early

37:46.732 --> 38:10.866
80s and like in other words they were more like a 
county agent ag teacher type situation down there

37:46.732 --> 38:10.866
their sanitation was just something to be a guest 
about the milk production and of course there's

37:46.732 --> 38:10.866
only two things down there really that mattered a 
great deal was was poultry and milk yeah you know

38:11.268 --> 38:15.434
The beef, you know, they had a lot of beef cattle, 
but people didn't eat beef. They ate chicken. And

38:17.076 --> 38:20.320
so they could raise chickens a lot faster. So I 
guess for seven, eight, ten years when I was there,

38:20.340 --> 38:29.552
we always met jointly with the Guadalajara 
Association. And we also went to Cancun, the

38:29.572 --> 38:35.200
academy did this. in the interest of the Diggids. 
And we were really trying to bring those people in

38:38.578 --> 38:42.363
and learn more about them. And we had some people 
that actually found work there. But it's awfully

38:44.466 --> 38:46.308
hard. Their standards of pay and their standards 
of paying are a little bit different. Yeah, well, I

38:51.414 --> 38:53.137
know what you mean. I know how you mean that. We had 
some people that got left high and dry. See, they

38:56.521 --> 38:59.264
can't get the drugs down there that weekend. And 
they won't let them come down there. If that's

39:01.087 --> 39:04.151
changed in the last five, six years, that'd be 
great. See, they liked it because they could come

39:04.171 --> 39:06.013
up here get all the drugs that they wanted through 
the veterinarian's sphere. And they couldn't get

39:10.111 --> 39:12.496
any drugs then. And their teaching facilities, 
they had a bunch of veterinary schools, but their

39:12.516 --> 39:20.509
teaching facilities were more like animal 
science, animal medicine. I was talking to Pinky

39:20.590 --> 39:25.538
from El Paso. And he used to talk about some of the 
rabies problems they have and the teaching

39:25.872 --> 39:32.341
problems and so forth. We have an outbreak going 
around Del Rio and down through there just about

39:32.361 --> 39:36.587
every so often. Of course, he's right there in 
Warriors, El Paso, and that's a problem. But they

39:40.713 --> 39:44.419
got, tell you what, they depend on those next to 
where we're in El Paso. I mean, they're really an

39:44.679 --> 39:53.011
asset to veterinary practice because you've got 
some fluent people that use the veterinarians on

39:44.679 --> 39:53.011
this side. Yeah. So basically though you felt like 
you had a good constructive career with TVMA.

39:58.833 --> 40:02.136
Yeah, I would be awfully unfair. I have to admit I 
wasn't really exactly ready to leave, but I had a

40:02.696 --> 40:11.585
great career and I made a lot of friends and they 
paid me well. It opened some doors. When I left it

40:13.346 --> 40:19.612
did one thing I think I probably should have been 
doing all the time and that's working for myself.

40:19.632 --> 40:22.575
But I had a good job, a good paying job, a lot of 
respect. And I think I probably burned out, truth

40:23.095 --> 40:26.359
be told. Yeah, that happened in a period of time. 
Was there any major issue or change in policy

40:29.242 --> 40:34.829
involved when you left? I really don't know. Or 
just kind of attrition or whatever? Well, you

40:38.654 --> 40:41.878
know, there were some people in the office that 
left. You know, there were a few unkind exchanges

40:41.898 --> 40:46.263
over the thing. Not by me so much, but by my 
supporters. Yeah. But you know. I know those

40:50.967 --> 40:52.309
things. You don't ever go back. I'm convinced. I 
don't care what it is. It's kind of like leaving

40:57.154 --> 40:58.335
home. But there was no great redirection after you 
left of the association. I think they were just

41:02.700 --> 41:04.842
trying to keep it in the middle of the road. We had 
grown into a pretty good little monster there. We

41:08.326 --> 41:12.270
had some real grandiose plans for doing things 
which later developed. Were you in the new

41:12.390 --> 41:13.451
building? Never was. See, I was never for that type 
of building. I wanted a big old downtown

41:19.087 --> 41:24.532
historical place where we could put a museum, you 
know, where we could be where the action is.

41:24.592 --> 41:25.974
Nobody's going to go out there. And of course, my 
idea was not to become a landlord. Yeah, that's a

41:29.757 --> 41:31.559
problem. I sense that the day I walk in those 
offices over there. I want, oh, maybe, maybe to the

41:33.841 --> 41:44.111
extent of a couple of offices, you know, maybe a 
kind of a compatible deal where we could have a

41:33.841 --> 41:44.111
central reception place that would serve the 
building. We'd have a central janitorial service

41:44.252 --> 41:48.756
and a central type of conference room area and 
place to coffee and all that kind of thing. But that

41:54.509 --> 42:00.578
never did come to head when I was there because I 
wouldn't push it. And I think that might be some

42:00.598 --> 42:03.562
reason people didn't like it. I just felt like that 
we needed, you know, they hadn't done anything big

42:03.582 --> 42:08.770
enough. The manager, the director always has some 
input. And I was holding out for something more

42:12.916 --> 42:17.803
like I described. And of course, You know, one of 
the things you do when you take over is you change

42:18.487 --> 42:22.753
things. I'm sure the thing to do was the new manager 
to come in, let's build that building. Sure, yeah.

42:27.719 --> 42:30.663
Hell, that gets everybody's mind off of 
everything else. Boy, it did, I think. It did. You

42:36.550 --> 42:43.379
know, I probably would have done the same thing, 
and maybe not the same idea, but I would have made

42:36.550 --> 42:43.379
some changes because it's important to do that. 
And you've got to do something that, that put the

42:45.588 --> 42:48.136
leadership behind it. You can do anything the 
first three years, you don't get fired. It's after

42:52.149 --> 42:53.573
that when it gets tough. It's damn tough to be 18. It 
is. That's a long career in anything. I was

42:59.185 --> 43:02.210
department head for five, and they were glad to see 
me go. You were probably glad to go. I was glad to go.

43:04.733 --> 43:07.437
It's something I think you should shoot for. I 
think you should compliment yourself a bit. Not

43:09.500 --> 43:10.421
everybody gets there. Well, that's true, too. Not 
everybody has a chance to do something like what

43:11.843 --> 43:14.166
I've done. I've got an ego like everybody else. I 
admire what you're doing already. I never run into

43:19.093 --> 43:22.137
people quite like you, I don't think, so that's 
interesting. I didn't know that world was there.

43:23.540 --> 43:32.731
If I knew it was that tough, you know, the first two 
years I got out, if I knew it was going to take me

43:23.540 --> 43:32.731
twice as long to get where I wanted to be as it did, I 
probably wanted to hunt me another good job. Good

43:32.751 --> 43:33.412
job, yeah. Yeah, that security is pretty good when 
you face that. I keep thinking, well, you know,

43:35.614 --> 43:37.897
they're going to beat my door down. We're going to 
get this thing going. You know, you've got to go

43:38.938 --> 43:40.440
beat on some doors yourself. Okay, one final 
question. I'll let you go. Is there anything you

43:43.323 --> 43:53.395
think in a history of Texas veterinary medicine 
that you really think ought to be there in terms of

43:43.323 --> 43:53.395
philosophy, attitude, values, or whatever, or 
information?

43:55.838 --> 44:05.168
Well, you know, philosophically, I think that you 
have to go back and give credit to the general

43:55.838 --> 44:05.168
practitioner. That is the backbone that got the 
organization going. It's the one that kept it

44:08.692 --> 44:10.133
going. I think it's still the real, the real fiber 
is still this old D&P. Maybe it's because of my

44:15.099 --> 44:16.881
background. But even the small animal 
practitioner that came from that background, you

44:17.481 --> 44:25.390
know, that frame of mind is the thing that kept this 
thing together. and taught it to progress. And of

44:28.046 --> 44:29.688
course, you know, it's all going to change. We've 
got a new breed cat out there, a new small animal

44:29.708 --> 44:35.737
practitioner, a new large animal practitioner. 
That's fine. But I think it would be a mistake to not

44:36.098 --> 44:52.201
try to ground this thing on the philosophy that the 
general practitioner is the one that spread the

44:36.098 --> 44:52.201
bread on the water and kept the thing going. I don't 
know... The other things, I have to say this, you

44:53.534 --> 45:09.657
have to give credit to the professional person who 
thought enough to come and entrust his money and

44:53.534 --> 45:09.657
his membership to his professional association. 
Without members, you can't do it. No, that's

45:11.440 --> 45:12.201
right. But you have to do something right to do 
that. Yeah, that's right. It's a mutual benefit

45:16.882 --> 45:19.104
society. And it would sure be a shame for the 
professional person to not look to the

45:19.465 --> 45:31.120
association as a very vital thing to your support. 
On that, we never did quite finish. Did that

45:32.902 --> 45:35.065
insurance program continue? Well, what we did is 
we phased it out. We just got to the point where We

45:39.518 --> 45:41.940
could not get the quality of service. We got the 
competitive. What we did, we blended into the

45:43.602 --> 45:47.585
AVMA, thank God, that allowed us to do it. But we did 
it because the time changed. If things were like

45:50.408 --> 45:55.673
they were when we started, we'd still be there. But 
you look at any association that's got an

45:55.733 --> 46:01.578
insurance program, they just send somebody else 
out. I mean, I'd say 90% of them. Especially the

46:03.720 --> 46:05.762
state associations. I imagine AVMA's probably 
doing well because they've got pretty much it. But

46:10.079 --> 46:16.806
see, the insurance business is a burden to the 
practitioner now. It used to be something that

46:16.866 --> 46:19.309
didn't cost too much. Yeah. You know, liability 
insurance. Nothing, yeah. And workers' comp

46:23.913 --> 46:25.715
didn't cost much. Yeah. And able to serve and 
everybody kind of took it on. Now, they look and

46:27.998 --> 46:32.863
criticize every premium, every coverage, and 
they should have. Yeah. And hospital costs have

46:33.784 --> 46:36.627
gone out of sight, you know. They need to sell 
policies. $75, $80 a month hospital, and that's

46:38.513 --> 46:44.401
$300, you know.

46:44.601 --> 46:48.025
So it's not a romance situation with that anymore. 
Better leave it alone. Yeah, you sure would. If I

46:52.171 --> 47:03.305
got into it with any other association, I would 
strictly get into it on some of the fringe stuff,

46:52.171 --> 47:03.305
you know, maybe term life, some of these required 
coverages, you know, that you've got to have when

46:52.171 --> 47:03.305
you want them or not. I stay out of the health field. 
Well, uh, Tony, are you going to pretty well stay

47:08.348 --> 47:10.630
with what you're doing now?
