WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:04.738
I went to JPL to interview for a job. And as the 
supervisor of the astronomy group, I did the

00:05.159 --> 00:11.768
interviewing. So that was in, I guess, sometime in 
1961. And

00:18.358 --> 00:24.747
what did you think of when you first met him? He does 
not act like the public's typical image of what an

00:24.767 --> 00:29.594
astronomer should act like. No. but he had a lot of 
enthusiasm and a lot of bounce to him. He was

00:38.054 --> 00:51.750
obviously knowledgeable, and he was interested 
in working in a field where not too many people were

00:38.054 --> 00:51.750
interested in working, and that seemed more than 
adequate to me to offer the man a job. Later, of

00:53.752 --> 00:59.299
course, we became very close personal friends, 
and it's a little hard since I've been in touch with

00:53.752 --> 00:59.299
him all of the time for the past 30 years to really 
remember back to what I thought of him 30 years ago.

01:06.077 --> 01:13.287
I can't help, I can't separate that from the 
contemporary Spinrad, but... He got pretty

01:13.307 --> 01:15.350
unhappy here at JPL. He got unhappy here because he 
couldn't get telescope time. And he, when he came

01:19.833 --> 01:26.363
here, assumed that he would be treated like any 
other young astronomer. And he found out to the

01:26.463 --> 01:28.926
contrary. He found out that people were simply not 
giving time on large telescopes to do planetary

01:28.967 --> 01:34.194
projects. They were looked down upon. And he tried 
to mine the old plate vaults at Mount Wilson. They

01:40.924 --> 01:42.547
were willing to have him do that. But as far as 
getting new time... McDonald or Mount Wilson, no

01:47.727 --> 01:52.495
luck. So he started looking around, and when he got 
a job offer from his old alma mater, he left and went

01:52.515 --> 02:02.012
to Berkeley. Okay, let's discuss the world's 
greatest planetary astrophysicist, Gerard

02:02.313 --> 02:09.065
Peter Kuiper. Why don't you first cross paths with 
him? Well, Kuiper was around the lab all of the time

02:12.567 --> 02:18.273
in the early days of the space program. And Kuiper, 
of course, tended to look upon anyone at JPL as

02:18.353 --> 02:24.319
being a good guy. Because to him, the people at JPL 
were building the kinds of spacecraft that he was

02:24.399 --> 02:31.487
interested in. They were promoting the kind of 
work that he wanted to do. And they were potential

02:35.070 --> 02:37.193
sources of funds. And so anybody who worked at JPL 
was his friend. saw anyone he recognized from JPL

02:42.875 --> 02:53.532
at a meeting and he tended to back you into the 
corner and began to harangue you with his latest

02:42.875 --> 02:53.532
theories and ideas and he was a great guy. On the 
other hand, if you were on an opposing team, he

02:53.572 --> 02:59.101
could be a pretty wicked player. I don't remember 
when I first met him. I know he came to the lab

03:02.446 --> 03:04.890
regularly. We had meetings with him throughout 
the period from, say, 59 on. But I couldn't give you

03:10.904 --> 03:13.007
an exact date. How about Girard de Vaucouleur? 
Well, I worked with de Vaucouleur on committees

03:19.776 --> 03:32.473
that were set up by NASA to look into the need for 
planetary telescopes.

03:33.128 --> 03:39.016
I attended these meetings, usually with Al Hibbs, 
sometimes not. But people involved included Al

03:39.076 --> 03:48.428
Wilson, , Stan Greenfield, who I guess was with 
RAND Corporation at the time. We sometimes met

03:50.211 --> 03:58.562
with people like, I don't know, what was his name, 
Edson, I guess it was, who was at the Pentagon at the

03:58.964 --> 04:06.814
time as a civilian scientist at the Pentagon. 
Anyway, I met de Vaucouleur working on these

04:07.334 --> 04:20.148
various teams together where we were trying to get 
support for a NASA building, one or more large

04:07.334 --> 04:20.148
planetary telescopes. And he was, of course, very 
enthused about his Mars work at the time, met with

04:20.168 --> 04:33.882
him often, and enjoyed his company very much.

04:34.553 --> 04:38.717
Tell me billions and billions of things about Carl 
Sagan. Well, Carl, of course, was a graduate

04:40.499 --> 04:46.004
student of Kuiper's when Kuiper first went to 
Arizona. In fact, I guess he was a graduate student

04:46.305 --> 04:53.892
before Kuiper went to Arizona and followed him 
there from Chicago. I guess Carl's PhD is actually

04:54.112 --> 04:58.757
still a Chicago PhD since he began it there. But I 
called Kuiper one day and said, Gee, we've been

05:04.388 --> 05:17.647
interested in ideas about solar system cosmology 
and the origin of the solar system and a lot of

05:04.388 --> 05:17.647
disagreement on this, but you've done a lot of work 
in the field. Could you sort of write us a position

05:17.667 --> 05:32.488
paper that tells us what at least your current 
ideas are on where things stand with our knowledge

05:17.667 --> 05:32.488
of how the solar system originally, how it 
originated? And he said, gee, I wish I could, but

05:33.110 --> 05:36.816
I'm awfully busy. However, I've got this very, 
very bright young graduate student named Carl

05:36.836 --> 05:44.850
Sagan, and I'm sure he'd do a bang-up job for you. 
And he really needs the money. He's very poor, and

05:46.773 --> 05:52.663
he'd do a great job, and it'd work out well all 
around. And so I said, well, fine, sure, we'll let

05:52.723 --> 05:56.349
Carl work on this. And so we met Carl. He was, of 
course, working on his thesis on the greenhouse

05:59.603 --> 06:04.550
model of the Venus atmosphere. And after he had 
pretty well along, why, he came up to the lab and

06:05.311 --> 06:12.923
gave us a seminar on the greenhouse model of the 
Venus atmosphere. And we all met him and

06:14.104 --> 06:20.554
known him ever since. Was he self-assured even 
then? He was pretty self-confident even in those

06:22.757 --> 06:28.125
days, yes, very much so for a graduate student. 
Yeah, he was always a very confident person, but

06:28.460 --> 06:33.268
not overbearing or anything. He was just quite 
sure of what he did.

06:39.939 --> 06:43.425
Where did you first meet Harlan Smith, and what did 
you think of him when you saw him? Harlan Smith, to

06:45.147 --> 06:50.957
me at the time, seemed one of the senior 
astronomers of the world. I don't remember where I

06:51.173 --> 06:53.617
first met Harlan. I remember many incidents where 
I was with him, like just the two of us had dinner

06:54.098 --> 07:10.987
together at Snowmass, Colorado, when we were both 
there for a meeting of the National Academy Solar

06:54.098 --> 07:10.987
System Exploration Committee. And I talked to him 
many times at meetings

07:19.355 --> 07:24.041
American Astronomical Society or of the 
Planetary Sciences Division. He, of course,

07:26.024 --> 07:30.029
hosted a couple of meetings of the Planetary 
Sciences Division at Austin. I ran into him in many

07:31.911 --> 07:37.178
places, but I really don't remember where I first 
met Harlan or when. But it was always a great

07:37.718 --> 07:40.502
pleasure to talk to him. I always felt that 
although he was a very senior man in the field, that

07:40.938 --> 07:52.053
he always treated everyone as if they were equal 
and seemed to respect other people's opinions. He

07:52.514 --> 08:06.913
was always an exciting person to talk to and that he 
was always full of both ideas about astronomy and

07:52.514 --> 08:06.913
knowledge of the current political situation and 
trying to get new telescopes or new probes or

07:52.514 --> 08:06.913
whatever underway. And I was always very happy 
when I could could sit down and talk to him. The last

08:12.854 --> 08:17.740
time I saw him was at the AAS meeting in Pasadena 
about five years ago. And there he grabbed me and

08:18.621 --> 08:30.737
said he had this very bright young woman who was 
about to get her PhD at Texas and wondered if there

08:18.621 --> 08:30.737
might be any place for her at JPL. It was Jackie 
Green. And I met Jackie, talked to her, and was very

08:33.661 --> 08:37.506
much impressed by her. It turns out she went to 
Hawaii for a couple of years, but she is, in fact,

08:37.807 --> 08:42.633
now at JPL. But he was looking after his graduate 
students, as he always did, and making a good case

08:43.554 --> 08:50.403
for them. Actually, I don't think she was his 
student. I think she was Roman Smolakowski's

08:52.226 --> 08:54.849
student. But she was there in the department, and 
he was looking out for them. Tell me something

09:00.937 --> 09:02.599
about Roger Moore.

09:06.595 --> 09:08.757
Didn't have a close relationship with Roger. Knew 
Roger when he was at headquarters. Served on a

09:10.499 --> 09:12.421
committee or two with him. Was never close to 
Roger. Never had any private dinners with him or

09:14.784 --> 09:19.189
anything like that. Couldn't really tell you much 
about Roger. Maybe you can tell me something about

09:23.453 --> 09:26.256
Nancy Roman. Oh, I could tell you some things about 
Nancy. Nancy and I served together on the

09:30.355 --> 09:36.421
Astronomy Subcommittee of NASA from 1960 to 62. 
Nancy, of course, chaired that committee. So in a

09:39.905 --> 09:41.307
sense, I worked for her. I was JPL's delegate for 
the first two years to that august group. Bill

09:47.954 --> 09:57.544
Brunk, for a part of that time, was the 
representative from Lewis Research Center,

09:47.954 --> 09:57.544
where he worked at the time, then left when he went 
back to finish his PhD. We had a lot of outstanding

09:58.722 --> 10:01.125
consultants on it. And that's another story in and 
of itself. But I worked with Nancy fairly closely

10:04.529 --> 10:06.972
for two years. And to be blunt about it, I was not 
always happy with Nancy. I think the thing that

10:16.244 --> 10:26.957
really frosted me was her very, very 
down-the-nose attitude toward solar system

10:16.244 --> 10:26.957
astronomy generally. She felt that it was very 
distinctly inferior to stellar and galactic

10:27.359 --> 10:31.655
work. And I remember when we had a meeting of the 
committee at the lab one time, she sort of took me

10:32.096 --> 10:39.343
aside and said, rather confidentially, that 
she'd been talking to Ira Bowen and that he had

10:39.745 --> 10:48.878
agreed that there were still some things that 
could be done from the ground in planetary

10:39.745 --> 10:48.878
astronomy. And she gave me this information as if 
it were a great discovery and something that, boy,

10:48.938 --> 11:06.424
wasn't this interesting, that the great man, the 
director of Mount Wilson and Palomar

10:48.938 --> 11:06.424
Observatory, actually said there were still some 
things that could be done from the ground in solar

10:48.938 --> 11:06.424
system astronomy. And she was very surprised by 
this. Well, I was promoting within the astronomy

11:10.238 --> 11:22.931
committee the need for NASA to build their own 
planetary telescope because of the difficulty of

11:10.238 --> 11:22.931
getting time. And I remember a meeting we had at 
Ames. I guess it was the last meeting that I

11:27.836 --> 11:31.319
represented the lab. I'd served my two years. 
People present included, for example, Jesse

11:33.341 --> 11:37.225
Greenstein as a consultant, We had on that 
committee people like Freeman Dyson, for

11:37.897 --> 11:44.363
example, was a consultant to the committee. There 
were a lot of big names there. Anyway, I made my

11:46.545 --> 11:49.387
pitch. It probably took 10 minutes saying why I 
felt it was important that NASA build their own

11:49.407 --> 11:55.093
planetary telescope. She turned to Gary Mulders, 
who was representing the National Science

11:56.634 --> 12:00.197
Foundation. Well, what do you think about this? 
And Mulders said that, well, he agreed totally

12:01.539 --> 12:06.503
with what I had said, that... The NSF could not 
support building additional telescopes. They

12:09.873 --> 12:21.403
were hard-pressed to keep up with their 
requirements as they were, and that he thought

12:09.873 --> 12:21.403
NASA indeed should go ahead and build their own 
planetary telescope, that they should support

12:09.873 --> 12:21.403
planetary astronomy. So she asked Jesse 
Greenstein, and Greenstein said, well, yeah, I

12:21.843 --> 12:26.127
quite agree. There are a number of things, useful 
things that can be done from the ground yet. NASA

12:30.171 --> 12:31.652
ought to do them. They're not going to get enough 
time to do them on existing telescopes. and yeah

12:35.525 --> 13:04.654
they should do it well i went away feeling really 
good i mean the whole committee had backed me up

12:35.525 --> 13:04.654
nasa ought to build a telescope well that was my 
last meeting but somebody else then later showed

12:35.525 --> 13:04.654
me the minutes of that meeting and nowhere in those 
minutes of that meeting do you ever find any part of

12:35.525 --> 13:04.654
this discussion that strongly supports nasa 
building a planetary telescope and that really

12:35.525 --> 13:04.654
frosted me that had just been written out of the 
minutes Tell me something about Bill Brunk, who

13:06.052 --> 13:14.438
actually ran the ground-based planetary 
astronomy for longer than everybody else put

13:06.052 --> 13:14.438
together, I guess. Yeah, I think that's true. Bill 
and I, of course, met each other when we were

13:20.395 --> 13:39.662
representatives from JPL and from Lewis on this 
initial Nancy Roman Planetary Astronomy, or not

13:20.395 --> 13:39.662
Planetary Astronomy, but this was the Astronomy 
Subcommittee, which included, at that time,

13:20.395 --> 13:39.662
solar system astronomy, solar astronomy, 
stellar and galactic astronomy. It covered all of

13:39.722 --> 13:41.084
astronomy.

13:44.348 --> 13:45.610
So that... We got to be friends and work together on 
that

13:45.995 --> 13:51.423
committee. And then he left to go back and finish 
his PhD, and then came back to headquarters as an

13:51.443 --> 13:58.853
employee. And Bill and I worked together closely 
over the years. He was my program manager when I was

14:03.359 --> 14:07.385
leader of the International Halley Watch. And

14:08.326 --> 14:14.635
we always got along well together. He supported me 
pretty well. I have no real complaints about that.

14:21.138 --> 14:41.702
I often felt, however, that as people seem to do 
when they spend a long period of time in

14:21.138 --> 14:41.702
Washington, D.C., I think they tend to lose touch 
with the realities in the field, as it were, and in

14:21.138 --> 14:41.702
the field of astronomy, and they tend to become 
more concerned about how do I fit what I want to do

14:42.290 --> 14:52.145
within my budget and how do I satisfy the boss, then 
am I suggesting what's best for astronomy? And so I

14:53.347 --> 15:00.237
often disagreed with him on whether he was really 
doing what was best for the field. I felt he was out

15:00.277 --> 15:08.690
of touch at times, but he tended to annoy me a little 
sometimes. But we always got along well. Do you

15:11.433 --> 15:13.636
think planetary astronomers mind out? No. I think 
there are, as long as the planets have

15:17.080 --> 15:23.569
atmospheres, those atmospheres are going to 
change. We don't even understand our own, let

15:23.609 --> 15:26.773
alone the atmospheres of the other planets. I 
think continuing study of the major planets is

15:26.833 --> 15:30.417
certainly in order. Until we have some kind of 
permanent presence in orbit around Mars or

15:31.939 --> 15:37.086
something, there's some... work perhaps yet to be 
done on Mars but I think particularly in the small

15:37.623 --> 16:00.188
bodies of the solar system there are so many of them 
that even if we eventually get missions to a few of

15:37.623 --> 16:00.188
them one or a comet or two a few asteroids there are 
so many of them out there that the only way that it's

15:37.623 --> 16:00.188
ever all going to be tied together is from a 
ground-based study of these objects and uh I think

16:00.725 --> 16:13.158
even solar system planetary astronomy has got a 
lot of future ahead of it because of the

16:00.725 --> 16:13.158
impossibility of doing it all from space. What's 
the position of planetary astronomy at JPL right

16:15.520 --> 16:21.346
now? I think there is a little sense of dread, a 
sense of Maybe we've seen the best days of it. I

16:30.550 --> 16:34.574
think there's a morale problem at JPL today, to be 
perfectly frank. The lab has generally been an

16:35.736 --> 16:45.286
ebullient place to work, a place where everybody 
sort of felt that the sky was the limit, upward and

16:35.736 --> 16:45.286
onward. We're doing great things. And next year, 
we're going to do even greater ones. I think that

16:50.091 --> 16:51.973
was true for many years. And I think there has now 
come a realization that, This isn't going to

16:57.678 --> 17:01.163
continue to happen quite that way. We're being 
forced, probably correctly, to do business in

17:01.263 --> 17:09.533
different ways in the sense that the 
multi-billion dollar missions are just not going

17:01.263 --> 17:09.533
to be flown. We've got to fly smaller missions. 
There is a change of direction. This always means

17:14.840 --> 17:22.791
some heartbreak for people who've been involved 
in the old way of doing business for a time. And I

17:23.351 --> 17:26.115
think among the planetary people in general, the 
lack of support, we've seen the loss of a number of

17:26.298 --> 17:34.927
very good people simply because they can no longer 
get their ground-based work funded. And I think

17:34.947 --> 17:42.955
there's a certain loss of morale and a fear of the 
future, perhaps, rather than an eagerness for the

17:34.947 --> 17:42.955
future. It's not a palpable thing exactly, but 
everybody's concerned. Let's put it that way.

17:51.340 --> 17:57.128
Well, that also answers what was going to be my next 
question, what do you think of the future? But

17:57.148 --> 18:09.504
again, this has got to be a guess, but you'll recall 
in the past there were always been rumors they were

17:57.148 --> 18:09.504
going to close JPL and make it the foothill campus 
of Pasadena City College or something like that.

18:09.644 --> 18:12.007
And of course, NASA does have big budgets. In the 
long-term future, do you see JPL around in 20

18:13.529 --> 18:20.959
years, and do you see any planetary astronomy 
being done at JPL if it's still here? I think JPL

18:21.833 --> 18:24.357
will still be here in 20 years, yeah. I think it'll 
be a rather different place than it is today. I

18:27.842 --> 18:34.051
think it won't have the outriggers that it does 
today, that is the least space around town. I think

18:34.111 --> 18:39.719
it'll probably all be here on one campus, so to 
speak, except for the computing facility at

18:34.111 --> 18:39.719
Woodbury. I think that the missions that we fly 
will be smaller, perhaps a bit more often than the

18:40.981 --> 18:49.613
big missions, but much smaller missions. I think 
that there will perhaps be a tauter, tighter

18:50.150 --> 19:05.050
management in the sense that I think that you'll 
find more a skunkworks approach to things. You

19:06.833 --> 19:16.526
won't throw people at a project, so to speak, that 
people will be just doing things a little

19:06.833 --> 19:16.526
differently than they've traditionally been 
done at the lab. And I think the same thing is true

19:16.566 --> 19:19.009
of... ground-based astronomy. I think there will 
always remain people here in the field, but I think

19:21.534 --> 19:38.801
that the number may be somewhat smaller, and I 
think that most people, instead of being able to

19:21.534 --> 19:38.801
spend 100 percent time on research, there's 
almost nobody doing that now even, although there

19:21.534 --> 19:38.801
were years ago. I think you'll find everybody will 
have maybe half time working on one of these

19:38.821 --> 19:46.954
projects, half time on their research, I think JPL 
will continue to exist, will continue to be a very

19:47.423 --> 20:08.590
reputable and enjoyable even place to work, but I 
think that the feeling of youthful enthusiasm,

19:47.423 --> 20:08.590
well, at least among some of us older ones, it isn't 
there anymore. We're not so young anymore is

20:08.610 --> 20:11.073
perhaps the answer to that. I shouldn't really 
answer for what some of the new young people coming

20:11.193 --> 20:16.300
in may think about it. Since planetary astronomy 
got back into high gear about 30 years or so ago,

20:17.427 --> 20:28.590
what do you think the taxpayers have gotten out of 
it?

20:28.610 --> 20:37.849
Well, I think there have been a number of useful 
things that have come out of the program, and you

20:28.610 --> 20:37.849
can go at this at many, many different levels. I 
think they've gotten a sense of almost a

20:38.808 --> 20:47.356
competition with the Soviets, and I think that the 
American public generally enjoys a good contest.

20:48.036 --> 20:50.178
I think they've got the feeling that we won some of 
it. I think they've been excited and had their

20:50.198 --> 20:55.103
minds opened a little bit by some of the 
discoveries. I think that's good. Clearly, the

20:58.366 --> 21:08.595
advances in miniaturization and computing and so 
on that were necessary for a lot of our space

20:58.366 --> 21:08.595
activities have been carried on into the regular 
commercial life. One might argue that perhaps the

21:11.457 --> 21:26.376
Japanese have made better use of these 
discoveries than we have in the commercial

21:11.457 --> 21:26.376
sector, but certainly people have very cheap, 
extremely potent desk computers today. I don't

21:26.396 --> 21:30.882
know how much of this would have happened without 
the space program. Maybe it would have happened

21:30.902 --> 21:35.207
anyway, but certainly I would feel it wouldn't 
have happened as soon. And I think this is true in

21:35.626 --> 21:38.591
the medical field. I think there have been a lot of 
great advances, miniaturization and so on,

21:38.631 --> 21:52.615
application of laser technology and so on, some of 
which was developed within the space program

21:38.631 --> 21:52.615
that's being applied here on Earth. You can 
really, I think just trying to open young people's

21:55.139 --> 22:01.650
eyes to the universe to the impressiveness the 
fascination of it to give them the impression that

22:02.018 --> 22:31.080
there's something more important out there than 
than accounting or or belonging to a gang is

22:02.018 --> 22:31.080
important it gives the people the young people a 
sense of place in the universe and that maybe

22:02.018 --> 22:31.080
there's something that they can go out and do that 
will add to the good of the world as opposed to just

22:31.313 --> 22:35.798
simply being consumers. I don't know. What do you 
think modern planetary astronomy has done for

22:37.679 --> 22:42.484
astronomy as a whole?

22:46.629 --> 22:46.709
Hmm. I hadn't thought about that one. You think 
it's shaken them up a little bit? Oh, it probably

22:52.214 --> 22:53.436
has. I'm sure there's been some instrumentation 
that's been developed by planetary people for use

22:53.496 --> 23:00.763
on space probes that's been applied to 
telescopes. I think a lot of the development,

23:01.199 --> 23:15.978
though, has been military and then has dribbled 
down into both planetary and classical galactic

23:01.199 --> 23:15.978
and stellar astronomy rather than any direct 
exchange just between the branches of astronomy.

23:16.599 --> 23:23.628
Well, in addition to that, I'm thinking of 
theories of star formation, which now, I guess,

23:16.599 --> 23:23.628
have to include planets. Well, that's certainly 
true. I mean, the discovery of the dust and what

23:24.829 --> 23:30.717
have you around... several stars on Fomalhaut, I 
guess. Beta Pictoris was the first one, yeah. And I

23:39.146 --> 23:45.857
guess there's some hints of material around Vega.

23:46.918 --> 23:51.485
That certainly has, they've interacted, let's 
put it that way. Well,

23:51.525 --> 23:56.012
as I said, Solar system astronomers, planetary 
astronomers, and stellar astronomers do talk to

23:56.802 --> 24:11.344
each other today and I think have some 
appreciation of the work that each other is doing,

23:56.802 --> 24:11.344
and I think that both fields are more fruitful for 
it. This is getting awfully general now, but what

24:11.364 --> 24:16.532
do you think planetary astronomy has done for 
science as a whole? It's obviously affecting

24:17.339 --> 24:26.431
something like biology, and I don't know about 
geology and meteorology. I don't know about

24:26.451 --> 24:28.013
chemistry so much. Well, what do you think? Well, 
sure. Again, one of the things that the space

24:31.878 --> 24:39.027
program in general has done is made us aware of the 
fragileness of our own environment and clearly if

24:39.682 --> 25:08.406
you're going to understand the Earth's 
atmosphere those same theories ought to apply to

24:39.682 --> 25:08.406
other planets and so we've got a number of test 
subjects now where we can try to apply general

24:39.682 --> 25:08.406
meteorological theories which I'm sure that 
studies of atmosphere of Venus and the major

24:39.682 --> 25:08.406
planets have had impact on our studies of our own 
atmosphere and Clearly, the studies toward the

25:09.837 --> 25:18.955
planet Earth, as NASA now puts it, are of great and 
even grave interest to the future of the human

25:09.837 --> 25:18.955
race. Considerations of the greenhouse effect of 
the ozone holes have a lot to say about whether

25:20.778 --> 25:27.651
we'll even survive. Of course, ultimately, there 
is the job of mapping out the small near-Earth

25:31.184 --> 25:38.671
asteroids to the extent that if one really does 
threaten the Earth, maybe we can do something

25:31.184 --> 25:38.671
about it in the future. It isn't to say we ought to 
mount any program now to do it, but what we ought to

25:38.711 --> 25:53.746
be doing is trying to find all of these bodies so we 
know if any of them are going to become a threat and

25:38.711 --> 25:53.746
they have an impact on everything, every person's 
life in that sense. But as far as direct impacts on

25:54.327 --> 25:57.630
science,

25:59.129 --> 26:09.663
All science is a unity, really, and I've just not 
thought about the direct interchanges, say,

25:59.129 --> 26:09.663
between astronomy and chemistry. It's had 
enormous impacts on physics, clearly. I mean, the

26:12.447 --> 26:20.358
interactions between astronomy and physics, 
they're one. Astronomy is just physics applied to

26:21.400 --> 26:26.807
the study of extraterrestrial subjects. You 
often hear the statements made, such as the space

26:27.310 --> 26:43.733
program has given us a view of the Earth as seen from 
outside as a planet, and studies, ground-based

26:27.310 --> 26:43.733
and probes of other planets have shown, yeah, it is 
just another planet, but unique and so on. But do

26:43.753 --> 26:54.288
you think the public has really changed its 
attitude towards, or the way it thinks about

26:43.753 --> 26:54.288
Earth, or just changed its attitude, period? 
Well... I think there has been a change. I think the

26:57.443 --> 27:10.903
average man in the street doesn't stop to think 
each day that he should be concerned about whether

26:57.443 --> 27:10.903
the earth is heating up or whether the ozone hole is 
going to cause him to have skin cancer or not. But

27:11.864 --> 27:24.503
certainly among those who read the daily 
newspapers or weekly news magazines or even those

27:11.864 --> 27:24.503
who listen to the TV news cannot help but be much 
more aware of their world and of the fragile nature

27:24.803 --> 27:39.500
of that world as a result of the space program, and 
in particular of various kinds of solar system

27:24.803 --> 27:39.500
studies. They have to be more aware of it and more 
concerned about it. I mean, in the past, man is

27:44.365 --> 27:54.777
largely worried about warfare, man against man, 
but now I think he is finally becoming very aware,

27:44.365 --> 27:54.777
or should be, that that he may be doing himself in 
with some of his activities, both as to use of

27:55.499 --> 28:05.852
resources and his disposal of materials. When you 
meet people, strangers, say, on an airplane,

28:08.014 --> 28:16.104
they're sitting next to you, what's their 
reaction when they find out what you do for a

28:08.014 --> 28:16.104
living? Most of them, oh, gee, that's 
interesting. And then they usually think a

28:18.367 --> 28:23.413
minute, and gee, Have you heard about and 
something that they've read somewhere or heard

28:23.545 --> 28:32.494
somewhere and were kind of curious about, and can 
you tell me anything about thus and so? That's

28:33.555 --> 28:35.417
often happened. They're usually fascinated. So

28:37.739 --> 28:44.466
at least in your experience, it's a positive 
image. I would say so, yeah. Originally, and for

28:46.628 --> 28:52.033
the first few decades, JPL was just strictly... 
let's face it, working for the Army as a contractor

28:52.385 --> 28:55.648
developing weapons. When you first came here, was 
that still a situation? Yes. Okay. When did JPL get

29:04.237 --> 29:11.745
handed over to

29:04.237 --> 29:11.745
the SA? Well, we did, of course, work with the Army 
in putting up the initial explorers, and then when

29:21.815 --> 29:35.822
We were talking with the Army and with the defense 
people about doing additional space-type

29:21.815 --> 29:35.822
missions that were more research than anything 
else before NASA came into existence. But NASA

29:35.922 --> 29:42.675
then, of course, was founded and immediately They 
were told that they could take over existing

29:43.128 --> 29:54.324
laboratories if the laboratories were willing to 
be taken over to work with them on the space program

29:43.128 --> 29:54.324
that had been proposed. And so they said, well, 
since we had worked on the Explorers, we're the

29:55.246 --> 30:02.596
obvious place to turn to. They'd like to have JPL. 
And people at JPL were very enthused about this.

30:06.602 --> 30:12.190
Most of the people here felt they'd much rather 
work on studies of the solar system than they would

30:06.602 --> 30:12.190
work on... on military field artillery, 
long-range field rockets, and that kind of thing,

30:12.676 --> 30:22.551
especially since that knowledge was applicable 
to the new space program as well. So that by the end

30:23.192 --> 30:29.922
of 58, everybody here was very enthused about 
being a part of NASA. I think it was in 58 that NASA

30:29.982 --> 30:37.553
took us over then with great enthusiasm on 
everybody's part here. Not that we disliked the

30:37.634 --> 30:41.100
Army people we worked for. I mean, in some ways, 
working for the Army was a rather pleasant

30:41.120 --> 30:50.114
experience in that we had a real skunk-works 
approach to things in those days. The Army would

30:50.255 --> 30:54.902
sort of come in with a bucket of money and suggest 
that we do some work in an area. The people here

30:54.922 --> 30:59.710
would kind of decide how the money should be spent. 
If there was a lot of money in the bucket at the end of

31:00.112 --> 31:07.178
the year, no one was concerned about it, that there 
might be any less the next year because we hadn't

31:00.112 --> 31:07.178
spent it all. I mean, they spent what they had to 
spend to get the job done. And if the bucket ran dry

31:09.800 --> 31:17.587
for some reason, why, they'd simply go back to the 
Army and say, hey, you know, can you fill up the

31:09.800 --> 31:17.587
bucket partway again? And usually the bucket 
would get filled up. And nobody was concerned in

31:20.129 --> 31:28.937
those days about which charge number to charge 
this hour's work to, or it was just There were broad

31:29.727 --> 31:37.600
tasks being assigned to JPL, and the people here 
decided how best to carry them out, and the money

31:29.727 --> 31:37.600
always seemed available. So in that sense, the 
working relationship was great. It was ideal.

31:42.889 --> 31:49.059
But, of course, the work being done was work on 
missiles like the Sergeant, for example. So the

31:50.461 --> 31:55.009
whole idea of converting our expertise over to JPL 
Learning more about the solar system was just, I

31:55.225 --> 32:02.164
don't know, I think everybody reacted with great 
enthusiasm, with a few exceptions.
