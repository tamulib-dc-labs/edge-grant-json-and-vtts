00:02.528 --> 00:05.177
I had a call from Acting President B.W.

00:05.197 --> 00:12.420
Williams saying, I want to see you in my office at 8 o'clock in the morning.

00:15.472 --> 00:17.896
And so I knew I was in big trouble.

00:19.459 --> 00:26.572
And I talked to some of the other people in the department, and one of the people was named Al Jackie.

00:26.632 --> 00:31.240
I don't know whether you knew Al Jackie or not, but Al said, I'll go with you.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.244
And I said, Al, this is my problem.

00:33.224 --> 00:38.811
No, he said, this is the chemistry department's problem, and I insist I'll go with you.

00:38.871 --> 00:41.654
So, I couldn't dissuade him.

00:42.355 --> 00:45.499
So, at eight o'clock, he and I walked into E.W.

00:45.519 --> 00:49.083
Williams' office and sat down, and Williams was furious.

00:51.286 --> 00:55.671
He gave me a lecture for at least thirty minutes.

00:55.651 --> 01:13.760
of how you do things in a decent university, and how I had not done things properly, and the administration was looking out for the good of the chemistry department, and I was questioning them and all sorts of things like that.

01:14.601 --> 01:22.654
And I had to wait until he got through, and so when he got through, I said, Dr. Williams, I want to ask you one question.

01:24.794 --> 01:30.903
Who is paying this new head of the chemistry department that you're going to hire?

01:33.547 --> 01:37.313
And he said, oh, A&M is going to pay it.

01:37.333 --> 01:37.994
And I said, no.

01:38.014 --> 01:41.098
A&M is going to pay half his salary.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.644
The Wells Foundation is going to pay half his salary.

01:45.405 --> 01:48.309
And as best I can determine, that's completely illegal.

01:49.571 --> 01:52.135
And somebody is going to get into big trouble.

01:53.026 --> 02:06.377
And the Welsh Foundation has no business dickering around with our activities in the chemistry department, certainly not picking a new head without us being considered at all.

02:07.454 --> 02:13.726
And he said, oh, I think the Welsh Foundation is just going to give us the money, and we're going to turn it over.

02:13.766 --> 02:17.292
And I said, that's not the way it operates with the Welsh Foundation.

02:17.833 --> 02:26.850
When they do something like that, they expect something in return, and you're getting yourself in the big trouble, and you better do some checking.

02:26.910 --> 02:30.677
And he looked real kind of pale for a little bit.

02:30.657 --> 02:35.644
Finally he said, let me do some checking and I'll get back with you.

02:35.665 --> 02:54.673
Two days later we got a note from the president's office saying the Welch Foundation has withdrawn their offer of support and this man is no longer being considered as the next head of the chemistry department.

02:54.653 --> 03:00.942
Now, Milligan knew what was going on exactly, and he knew I was involved.

03:00.962 --> 03:09.694
And so it came time, shortly after that, to submit proposals for renewal of my research grant.

03:10.395 --> 03:23.192
And amazingly enough, I got a letter from them saying, we'd be pleased to have you submit another proposal for renewal of your research, a search grant.

03:24.573 --> 03:25.755
You said D.W.

03:25.775 --> 03:26.095
Williams.

03:26.155 --> 03:27.277
Did you mean Jack Williams?

03:27.497 --> 03:27.878
No.

03:27.898 --> 03:28.739
Or it was D.W.?

03:28.759 --> 03:29.119
D.W.

03:29.199 --> 03:29.961
Back in the 50s.

03:30.061 --> 03:30.541
That's right.

03:30.621 --> 03:30.902
Oh, okay.

03:30.922 --> 03:31.423
That's right.

03:31.863 --> 03:34.787
Yeah, this was about 58, somewhere along in there.

03:34.807 --> 03:47.605
The chemistry department began to make great progress in growth and development and research and all during the Rudder-Wayne Hall years.

03:47.625 --> 03:48.106
That's true.

03:48.647 --> 03:49.428
Absolutely true.

03:49.448 --> 03:50.950
All right.

03:50.970 --> 03:54.495
What about then in the years of Jack Williams?

03:54.982 --> 03:55.783
in the 70s.

03:57.165 --> 03:58.967
Martell still there?

03:59.207 --> 04:01.931
No, Martell was going strong.

04:01.951 --> 04:02.832
And John Calhoun?

04:05.676 --> 04:09.000
I didn't see any significant changes in our department.

04:11.083 --> 04:16.770
What did you and your colleagues think of President Williams and Vice President Calhoun's leadership?

04:20.041 --> 04:23.926
Williams, I never got to know very well at all, personally at all.

04:25.407 --> 04:27.189
Calhoun was one of my neighbors.

04:27.390 --> 04:39.404
I lived only a block from him, and he and I have always been good personal friends, but I have some real reservations about Calhoun.

04:41.206 --> 04:48.394
Dick Winerti was one of the key researchers, and you smile about Dick.

04:50.382 --> 04:55.287
Yeah, I never could quite figure Winarty out.

04:56.007 --> 05:00.792
I can remember, I never had much contact with him.

05:01.152 --> 05:02.213
I knew him, met him.

05:02.794 --> 05:11.242
We used to have university dances and things like that, so I knew Winarty and his wife very well.

05:12.984 --> 05:16.407
One day he called me over to his office and

05:17.770 --> 05:46.377
I don't know till this day what that call was all about, but all I can say in recollection of what was said to me that day, it appeared to me that he had the opinion that I had some clout around the campus that I didn't feel I had, and he was playing up to me in some way.

05:47.352 --> 05:55.363
That's about the only personal situation I had with Winarty.

05:55.504 --> 06:08.842
But again, that left a bad taste in my mouth, because he was expecting something, I think, in return, and I didn't know what it was.

06:08.943 --> 06:14.170
And shortly after that, he went to Houston, and so that was the end of that.

06:14.521 --> 06:21.108
Looking back over, because you served as an active member of the faculty until what year?

06:21.128 --> 06:21.989
77.

06:22.009 --> 06:23.030
Until 77.

06:23.050 --> 06:27.014
All right, so 25 years.

06:27.375 --> 06:28.316
That's right.

06:28.336 --> 06:42.030
In that quarter century, looking back, what were the key positive decisions that the university made in those years?

06:42.010 --> 06:46.994
Oh, two or three, absolutely no question.

06:47.175 --> 06:57.724
The admission of women brought in all kinds of bright females who didn't just come because there were boys there.

06:57.744 --> 07:05.131
I had women in my organic chemistry class that were wanting to get in vet school, and they were top-notch.

07:06.532 --> 07:12.017
Quality gals came to A&M.

07:11.997 --> 07:26.536
Certainly, accepting blacks and anybody else who wants to come for my feelings was a major step in the right direction.

07:27.337 --> 07:28.359
You couldn't go on.

07:28.759 --> 07:39.253
I was on the school board at A&M Consolidated when we integrated the school over there, and it was high time, you know.

07:40.195 --> 07:49.885
We had the expense of trying to fund two schools when there were only about 100 total black people over there.

07:50.995 --> 07:53.858
And that's stupidity as far as I'm concerned.

07:55.080 --> 08:08.474
And so, yeah, admitting women and certainly the making the core optional played a major role.

08:08.975 --> 08:12.419
Did we miss any opportunities in those years that you can think of?

08:14.801 --> 08:17.104
Once this got started, things moved

08:17.557 --> 08:30.743
Nicely, and I don't, looking back, I'm sure we missed some opportunities, but I don't know that they were major opportunities at all.

08:30.763 --> 08:34.009
Should we have allowed the enrollment to get to the limit it is now?

08:34.029 --> 08:35.532
No, not in my opinion.

08:36.845 --> 08:57.899
It's my feeling that somewhere around 30,000 quality students makes a university big enough that it can offer everything that a good university ought to offer, and anything beyond that begins to create more chaos than anything else.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.363
That's just my personal feeling.

09:00.904 --> 09:03.308
How would we have selected under

09:03.288 --> 09:10.600
the optimum circumstances, how would we have selected the 30,000 students?

09:10.860 --> 09:21.617
At that time, that would have been tough because I've been told by students over the years, A&M is the place to go.

09:23.926 --> 09:34.918
If you can get into A&M, A&M offers something that no other schools, one or two things that no other school really offers, it's the right place to go.

09:35.899 --> 09:43.388
In your own research, what were some key proud moments for you in your own research?

09:43.428 --> 09:52.718
What was your first big research accomplishment and then go on?

09:53.120 --> 09:54.222
I did a number of things.

09:54.322 --> 10:00.192
I was one of these people that didn't stick in a single field.

10:00.874 --> 10:15.820
If somebody brought to me a research project that was interesting and wanted my help as people in oceanography did on a number of occasions, Don Hood.

10:16.205 --> 10:23.577
and I worked together on projects on a number of occasions that had absolutely no relation to what I was doing.

10:23.597 --> 10:36.036
I improved the process for carbon-14 analysis determination of

10:36.016 --> 10:38.899
age of organic objects.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.443
I thought that was a real good piece of work that I did.

10:43.683 --> 10:44.844
We don't need it anymore.

10:44.924 --> 10:54.232
We've got more very elegant electronic equipment that can do it without my work.

10:55.574 --> 11:04.842
I came out of Monsanto very interested in working on

11:05.328 --> 11:11.944
compounds that had this carbon phosphorus bond in it because there was no one in the U.S.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.348
doing that at that time.

11:13.408 --> 11:21.548
And so one of the things I decided, wanted to do out of pure curiosity, you can

11:24.278 --> 11:35.829
make sort of structural equivalents of our amino acids that make up all the proteins in our body.

11:37.751 --> 11:50.303
You can make them from organophosphorus compounds, replacing the carboxylic acid group in an amino acid with a phosphonic acid group.

11:50.890 --> 12:01.506
And we knew, we talked about this at Monsanto before I left there, but there seemed to be no dollar sign in front of this.

12:01.606 --> 12:10.960
So you make a number of amino phosphonic acids that are similar to glycine and alanine and tyrosine and so forth.

12:11.020 --> 12:19.733
They're interesting compounds and they might have the possibility of some interesting biological properties.

12:20.523 --> 12:26.972
But it's a pretty long shot, so I decided to do this when I got here.

12:28.254 --> 12:37.688
And I was able to come up with a synthesis, a very general synthesis, to make these compounds.

12:37.708 --> 12:40.412
And we made about 50 of them, I guess.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.835
All kinds of...

12:43.051 --> 12:55.862
variations and modifications, and we made some that were analogs of naturally occurring amino acids, analog of glassine and alanine and so forth.

12:56.603 --> 13:02.708
And one of the naturally occurring amino acids is beta alanine.

13:02.748 --> 13:09.034
It has an amino group one carbon further down the carbon chain.

13:09.074 --> 13:11.556
There's a total of

13:11.772 --> 13:12.553
three carbons.

13:12.613 --> 13:16.940
There's a carboxylic acid, two carbons, and an amino on the end.

13:17.521 --> 13:22.989
All the other amino acids have the amino on the first carbon atom from the carboxylic acid.

13:23.009 --> 13:34.506
Anyway, we made the analog of beta-alanine, which is two-aminoethyl phosphonic acid, and published it, and

13:36.781 --> 13:59.734
Then I picked up a chemical abstract journal one day, and there was an abstract of an article that had been published in Japan from the University of Tokyo by two Japanese chemists, one by the name of Masaki Horiguchi and

14:00.406 --> 14:02.810
And the other, his prof was Kandatsu.

14:03.371 --> 14:14.331
And they had found, of all things, this 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid in the rumen of ruminating animals.

14:15.728 --> 14:30.750
And they had come to the conclusion that they had been synthesized in the rumen, and you have some strange critters.

14:30.730 --> 14:48.072
microorganisms, they're a little higher in the scale than bacteria, but they found that these were capable of synthesizing this compound just from inorganic phosphate, sodium phosphate, something like that.

14:49.654 --> 14:57.143
Now, why would an organism in the ruminating atom like a cow or a deer

14:57.528 --> 15:02.417
go out of its way, not to make small amounts, they made large amounts.

15:03.098 --> 15:05.322
I mean, really large amounts.

15:06.584 --> 15:13.697
Well, we don't, to this day, we don't know the complete answer to this story, but in any event,

15:15.483 --> 15:19.649
I read this first and I said, oh, those guys are wrong.

15:19.689 --> 15:23.155
Aminophosphonic acids don't occur in nature.

15:23.175 --> 15:33.691
And so I sat down and wrote to Horiguchi and said, I have read your article.

15:33.751 --> 15:36.495
It's a very interesting article because

15:36.475 --> 15:45.410
We have been working on the synthesis of amino phosphonic acids, among which we have synthesized two amino ethyl phosphonic acid.

15:45.430 --> 15:51.139
They had identified it not by getting any quantity that they could even see.

15:51.179 --> 16:00.475
They had identified it by measuring its physical behavior and chromatographic systems and things like that.

16:00.795 --> 16:02.398
It behaved exactly like

16:02.378 --> 16:10.350
synthetic 2-aminoethyl phosphonic acid and they concluded incorrectly that it was that compound.

16:11.152 --> 16:25.994
I didn't believe that they were right and so I said I've got large amounts of 2-aminoethyl phosphonic acid willing to send you any amounts you'd like to have to compare with your results.

16:26.275 --> 16:27.677
They had

16:28.231 --> 16:34.220
They had never isolated any measurable amount of it.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.601
Well, it turned out they were right.

16:36.943 --> 16:37.624
It is there.

16:37.684 --> 16:40.348
Not only is it there, it's in a lot of places.

16:40.448 --> 16:51.644
It's in oysters, it's in clams, all kinds of marine organisms, sea anemones, sea pansies, all kinds of things.

16:52.606 --> 16:56.331
And in the

16:58.977 --> 17:00.278
organs of humans.

17:01.359 --> 17:08.706
You can isolate it from, oh, it's present in milk, a fairly large amount of it in cow's milk.

17:08.726 --> 17:19.115
So when you drink cow's milk, you get a pretty good slug of it and the body puts it into the heart, the liver, all kinds.

17:19.516 --> 17:23.720
It's been isolated from all sorts of human organs.

17:25.001 --> 17:28.444
No one to this day really knows for sure

17:28.829 --> 17:45.185
what this stuff is doing and why an organism like a sea anemone or something like that would go out of its way to synthesize a compound that it doesn't seem to use to any significant degree.

17:45.205 --> 17:52.953
It has it in the organism, but anyway, that was a fun deal.

17:53.954 --> 17:56.136
Other research accomplishments you're proud of?

17:57.230 --> 18:05.719
I may be the proudest of all of my research accomplishments was that project at Monsanto.

18:06.099 --> 18:18.973
That synthesis of nerve gas was a fun job to do, a frightening job to do at times, an exceedingly difficult job.

18:20.315 --> 18:26.241
But we had 12 people in there that worked together absolutely wonderfully.

18:27.267 --> 18:34.163
And that's what research is all about when you can get everybody involved in a project like that to really contribute.

18:35.205 --> 18:35.425
All right.

18:35.446 --> 18:42.221
With students here, what are some of the doctoral students that you enjoyed working most?

18:42.241 --> 18:43.183
And where are they now?

18:44.716 --> 18:54.148
Well, the student that developed this synthesis of these amino phosphonic acids was my first real graduate student.

18:55.009 --> 19:08.547
His name was James Chambers, and he came to me from a little Seventh-day Adventist school out of West of Fort Worth or near Fort Worth.

19:08.527 --> 19:18.282
He left here and was teaching at a Seventh-day Adventist college in Walla Walla, Washington.

19:18.363 --> 19:20.346
Now he's retired now, I'm sure.

19:20.406 --> 19:25.694
He was no youngster when he came to me.

19:25.714 --> 19:30.602
He was a very, very excellent student.

19:31.561 --> 19:49.519
I had a boy who had been badly crippled with, what was he, crippling disease?

19:50.721 --> 19:51.281
Polio?

19:51.361 --> 19:53.183
Polio, yeah, when he was young.

19:53.203 --> 19:54.985
He could just barely walk.

19:56.066 --> 19:59.830
His legs were all twisted up.

20:01.767 --> 20:08.835
He was an absolutely wonderful experimentalist.

20:08.955 --> 20:16.303
Unfortunately, he came down with, I guess, liver cancer.

20:20.087 --> 20:29.698
This poor guy, he really got the bad end of the deal and died a few years ago in his home in Colorado.

20:32.007 --> 20:33.730
These were two of them.

20:33.750 --> 20:44.886
I had a young Armenian kid by the name of Marijanian, who was an excellent laboratory man.

20:45.166 --> 20:58.386
I had a Greek student, and I'm not sure exactly how he got here, but he ended up here, I think it was at the University of Tennessee in some way.

20:59.024 --> 21:00.646
got over here and worked for me.

21:01.948 --> 21:04.991
Constantinos Scratas was his name.

21:05.592 --> 21:06.453
How do you spell it?

21:06.473 --> 21:06.854
Do you know?

21:06.874 --> 21:08.456
S-C-R-E-T-T-A-S.

21:08.876 --> 21:09.417
Scratas.

21:09.757 --> 21:12.441
Constantinos with a K or a C?

21:12.461 --> 21:22.213
C. Had a South Korean student.

21:22.193 --> 21:39.717
who did some beautiful work on separating the optically active isomers of one of these synthetic amino phosphonic acids, and he went back.

21:39.977 --> 21:49.770
He was teaching at the University of, let's see,

21:52.771 --> 21:57.576
one of the universities right in Seoul, University of Seoul, I guess it was.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.760
And he went back there and he's retired now.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.021
He was an older man.

22:03.081 --> 22:10.309
In all of your teaching days, surely you must have had some interesting experiences.

22:10.869 --> 22:21.360
Can you share some perhaps one-of-a-kind Aggie experiences that would have maybe humor or serious or sad moments?

22:23.635 --> 22:25.560
In my research activities?

22:25.580 --> 22:26.784
No, not necessarily.

22:26.984 --> 22:31.136
Oh, just... Classroom and working with students.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.405
I'll tell you one that I'll always remember.

22:36.571 --> 22:37.493
Uh...

22:38.789 --> 23:08.796
I was teaching first few years I was teaching freshman chemistry and I had a big class and I had consecutive classes on consecutive hours and I was at the end of one of the classes and was standing up by my desk talking to some students before they left and other students were coming in and I laid my grade book on the table and looked around and the grade book wasn't there.

23:08.776 --> 23:16.428
So I inquired of the people in the room if they knew where my grade book was.

23:16.568 --> 23:17.229
No one did.

23:17.270 --> 23:28.387
And some students said, it was toward almost the end of the semester, and somebody said, you don't have any grades.

23:28.588 --> 23:30.991
How are you going to give grades in the course?

23:31.432 --> 23:34.497
And I said, well, as of right now, everybody has an F.

23:35.118 --> 23:40.010
because I don't have any idea what else, what grade to give anybody.

23:40.331 --> 23:44.541
This kid ran after him.

23:45.122 --> 23:52.300
At the end of the next class, I went to my office, and before I went in my office, I could see my grade book.

23:52.280 --> 23:56.584
sticking under my door.

23:56.604 --> 24:05.593
And I picked it up and looked at it and it was pretty obvious that one of the students had changed one of his grades.

24:05.613 --> 24:08.315
He had done a very bad job.

24:08.816 --> 24:15.202
It was a student in that first class and he had changed it just enough.

24:15.302 --> 24:20.447
I think at the time you didn't have to take the final exam if you had a certain grade.

24:20.827 --> 24:21.848
And he had raised his

24:22.267 --> 24:29.135
grade on one or two of his exams just enough that he was not going to, he was going to be exempt and take an exam.

24:30.357 --> 24:42.992
And so I had one other class, the students, and I called this student over and I said, I know exactly what you did.

24:45.048 --> 25:00.984
And I could cause you real trouble by reporting you to the authorities because you did things that good Aggies don't do.

25:01.004 --> 25:09.692
But I'm not going to do anything except you get an F in the course.

25:10.913 --> 25:12.675
You had a B in the course.

25:14.697 --> 25:23.549
I hope that you'll remember this because you didn't have to do that to get a pretty good grade.

25:24.530 --> 25:27.735
And so two or three years later, I was walking.

25:28.015 --> 25:30.819
I lived that time over on Marsteller.

25:32.121 --> 25:40.232
I was walking to work one morning and just as I walked inside the campus, a car stopped there.

25:40.668 --> 25:49.851
And a boy and a girl were in the car and this fellow leaned out and he said, I'll take you over to the chemistry department.

25:50.192 --> 25:51.114
And there was this boy.

25:53.039 --> 25:58.272
And I was a little surprised and got in the car and he said,

25:58.252 --> 26:00.335
You don't have to be coy about anything.

26:00.375 --> 26:03.099
This is my wife that we just married recently.

26:03.740 --> 26:04.742
She knows the story.

26:05.844 --> 26:09.389
He said, probably is the best thing that ever happened to me in my life.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.673
I've never done a stupid thing like that again.

26:16.420 --> 26:19.565
So once in a while something pays off like that.

26:20.626 --> 26:25.253
Did any students ever try any tricks in your class that you can recall?

26:25.293 --> 26:26.976
Any Aggie good bull?

26:30.652 --> 26:31.973
Pranks?

26:33.254 --> 26:34.436
Not really.

26:34.456 --> 26:38.720
I was all business in my class.

26:38.780 --> 26:52.372
When I walked in class, I felt I had the responsibility to teach these kids as best I could and give them all my time up to doing that.

26:53.313 --> 26:54.915
And I was awfully hard on them.

26:56.576 --> 26:58.498
I expected good performance.

27:00.115 --> 27:16.285
But I finally told, last years I taught organic chemistry, sophomore organic chemistry that pre-meds and pre-vets and pre-dental students, chem engineers I believe all took this course and these were all people

27:16.568 --> 27:21.796
Except the chem engineers were fighting for good grades to get into a professional school.

27:22.958 --> 27:25.501
And so grades were very important to them.

27:26.783 --> 27:35.556
And I worked out a system that I used in that class that worked really well.

27:36.077 --> 27:42.627
I had a high failure rate in some of my early classes.

27:42.607 --> 27:49.199
They did not perform up to what I expected them to do, and I didn't know how to activate them.

27:50.962 --> 27:53.967
In this course, I finally figured out a way to do it.

27:58.695 --> 28:04.125
One of the things I told them, first day of class,

28:07.210 --> 28:11.636
You can get a conference with me if you don't understand anything.

28:11.796 --> 28:16.243
The first thing you need to do is get a hold of me and find out what the problem is.

28:16.463 --> 28:18.926
I'll explain it to you.

28:19.046 --> 28:31.424
If you can't find me in my office during regular hours, you can get a hold of me anytime at my home if I'm there up to midnight.

28:33.947 --> 28:35.209
And they didn't believe this.

28:36.691 --> 28:41.960
They said, you'd let somebody come by and talk to you at midnight?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.442
Yeah, I would.

28:45.045 --> 28:45.766
And they tried it.

28:47.009 --> 28:51.596
And not enough did.

28:54.061 --> 28:55.543
But...

28:59.303 --> 29:03.807
I felt that I had a real responsibility.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.911
I loved to teach kids in the classroom.

29:07.371 --> 29:11.575
I loved my research too, but I had as much fun in the classroom.

29:12.997 --> 29:18.162
But it was, I didn't get, I was never satisfied with my results.

29:20.324 --> 29:25.429
The quality of the students in the last few years

29:25.763 --> 29:27.486
of your service at A&M.

29:27.586 --> 29:30.552
Compare that with the quality of the students when you first got here.

29:30.572 --> 29:31.954
No comparison whatsoever.

29:32.916 --> 29:40.971
They were so bad in those first few years that I don't even know how to describe it adequately.

29:41.575 --> 29:52.368
The last few years, well, when I started teaching that organic course, I taught it for five years, that particular course.

29:52.388 --> 29:58.955
I taught about every, I taught more courses in the chemistry department than any other professor ever has.

29:59.736 --> 30:03.060
I created a bunch of graduate courses over there.

30:04.181 --> 30:09.928
But when they assigned me to this sophomore organic class,

30:12.389 --> 30:18.636
The first five years, I couldn't figure out how to get these people.

30:19.196 --> 30:25.944
Organic chemistry is not like any other subject in the entire college curriculum.

30:27.285 --> 30:30.929
You've got to, you can't memorize.

30:31.750 --> 30:33.412
There's too much information.

30:33.652 --> 30:38.177
You've got to understand, and I couldn't get these kids to

30:39.136 --> 30:43.104
get the basic principles and use the reasoning that it took.

30:44.667 --> 30:52.183
And so I was having an awful high

30:53.007 --> 31:11.148
punk grade and Z's and D's, and one of the students came to me one day and said, you're not the only prof teaching this course, there are two or three others, there were.

31:11.188 --> 31:21.259
One of these other profs, we know, all you have to do is show up in class every time and you'll make at least a B.

31:22.387 --> 31:27.775
If you do anything extra, you get an A. And you're killing us in this class.

31:29.918 --> 31:33.463
And I said, well, there's a simple solution to that.

31:34.345 --> 31:37.570
Drop my course and sign up for his course.

31:39.532 --> 31:43.939
But once I figured out how to really get...
