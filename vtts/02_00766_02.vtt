WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:04.608
were regarded rather highly. Yeah,

00:04.648 --> 00:15.480
Scripp Mitchell was, he was a drawing teacher. I 
enjoyed him. He was a fine old gentleman.

00:24.531 --> 00:26.393
Colonel R.T. Milner, he was a I was a native of 
Henderson and was a friend of my mother and father.

00:32.790 --> 00:34.392
He was president at that time. He was president all 
the time you were there, I believe, was he not? Did

00:37.876 --> 00:39.858
you have much personal contact with him? Very 
little. Very little, even though he was a family

00:40.499 --> 00:43.342
friend. That's right. I didn't want to be accused 
of polishing the apple. Uh-huh. Well, I could see

00:51.873 --> 00:53.695
where that might be a problem. Yeah.

00:57.760 --> 01:07.470
What was the overall attitude, would you say, of 
the students to President Milner on one hand and

00:57.760 --> 01:07.470
also to the commandant on the other hand? That 
would be the total university administration.

01:11.814 --> 01:15.278
Well, they liked Colonel Milner. They liked 
Captain Moses. But Levi and Gene Brown, they

01:18.361 --> 01:25.708
didn't think so much of. He was the commandant the 
last year or so you were there. What was the problem

01:30.084 --> 01:31.666
with Mr. Brown? I guess he was just a little too,

01:32.747 --> 01:47.563
I don't know whether you'd call it strict or what, 
but the boys, they didn't like him as well as they

01:32.747 --> 01:47.563
did Captain Moses. Captain Moses was a Texan to 
start with. Was there a big age difference between

01:50.927 --> 01:54.531
Captain Moses and Mr. Brown? Not too much. 
Lieutenant Brown, he was the first lieutenant.

02:02.805 --> 02:03.326
Was there a captain there? Moses was the captain.

02:08.091 --> 02:10.534
They had both been regular Army for a good while, 
though, I think. Yes.

02:18.683 --> 02:22.527
One of the things that's of a considerable amount 
of interest to us is the numerous traditions which

02:22.895 --> 02:27.883
are carried on particularly in the Corps of Cadets 
today. And

02:28.764 --> 02:38.919
we like to find out which of these were in vogue when 
you were a student. Today we have such things as the

02:40.381 --> 02:49.375
silver taps, the muster, and the bonfire in 
particular. and some other odds and ends. Were any

02:52.660 --> 02:56.845
of these in existence at the time you were there? 
No, we never had a bonfire, and we never had silver

02:56.865 --> 03:05.394
taps, and we never had a muster during my time 
there. Have you been to a muster since you

03:05.414 --> 03:07.557
graduated? Not there. I've been to it locally. 
Yeah, locally.

03:14.124 --> 03:17.708
Well, we had understood that that the muster 
tradition began in 1903 when the Corps decided

03:18.093 --> 03:31.091
that Texas Independence Day should not be a school 
day and they need to have a holiday. It seemed to me

03:31.111 --> 03:37.239
we had a holiday, but we didn't have a muster as 
such. Well, they don't have a holiday today, but

03:37.679 --> 03:42.246
they have a muster. Kind of reversed it there.

03:46.865 --> 03:58.319
We know that from time to time, some of the faculty 
children, faculty, perhaps faculty wives or

03:46.865 --> 03:58.319
other faculty relatives, girls in particular, 
attended classes at A&M. Were there any girls in

03:58.379 --> 04:01.783
classes while you were there?

04:07.851 --> 04:12.957
Colonel Miller had a niece that, what was her name?

04:17.071 --> 04:18.553
that attended some classes. She lived with them 
and attended some classes.

04:26.666 --> 04:32.374
Gieske's had two daughters that attended some 
classes.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.022
What Gieske was that? He was... F.E.? F.E., I 
guess. Taught there, and he was later on, I

04:42.569 --> 04:44.932
believe... He was in some phase of engineering, I 
don't know. He was college engineer for a long,

04:48.716 --> 04:53.221
long time, I believe, and a college architect. And 
he was in the... Well, now, wait a minute. Must not

04:56.785 --> 04:58.086
have been F.E. This gentleman had a Halliburton 
stash.

05:08.338 --> 05:12.222
But F.E., if I'm thinking, no, I'm... I'm thinking 
of another one, I guess. If he was class of 88 or

05:15.205 --> 05:17.629
something like that. He's probably the one. The 
one I'm thinking about was class of 12, I believe. I

05:23.337 --> 05:25.580
believe he had a son probably class of 12. Yeah.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.148
I've forgotten now what his name was. Those are the 
only three that I recall. I don't think we've

05:34.713 --> 05:37.797
covered this yet.

05:40.962 --> 05:41.803
We know that there were number of students who had 
jobs of one sort or another while they were there,

05:42.087 --> 05:48.914
and of course continue that practice today. Did 
you have some type of student employment while you

05:48.954 --> 05:52.897
were there? No. Okay.

06:02.346 --> 06:07.131
Yeah, we had all sorts of...

06:07.151 --> 06:09.293
I used to be over at the experimental station. He 
had the newspaper, Houston Post, I believe it was.

06:20.676 --> 06:25.883
He delivered it on campus or something?

06:26.403 --> 06:28.506
He subscribed to it and he delivered it. What was 
his

06:29.507 --> 06:37.677
name? Having gone through school and been in the 
Corps of Cadets and having attained the

06:38.163 --> 06:52.362
rank of captain the time you graduated, did you 
participate in the First World War then after you

06:38.163 --> 06:52.362
graduated? Yes. In what capacity did you serve? 
Well, I tried to get in everything I could, and I had

06:57.750 --> 07:04.258
flat feet, and they turned me down. I finally went 
to San Antonio while I was working in San Antonio.

07:09.010 --> 07:21.908
And a friend of mine who, I was working for the Bell 
Telephone Company, and a friend of mine who was

07:09.010 --> 07:21.908
with the Bell Telephone, in fact, I moved to San 
Antonio to take his place. He had gotten into the

07:23.110 --> 07:32.723
Signal Corps and got a commission right out of 
Civil Life, and he told me about it, so I went out.

07:34.289 --> 07:37.334
The doctor that examined me all he noticed was that 
thumb. I sprained that wrist one time, and that's

07:37.454 --> 07:42.261
all I could do with that thumb was do it like that. I 
couldn't straighten it out to save my neck that

07:42.301 --> 07:45.486
way. He said, what's the matter with that thumb, 
son? I said, nothing. Wiggled it. Well, I was in the

07:51.474 --> 07:52.336
Army. I got a commission right out of the Civil 
Life, the Signal Corps.

07:59.086 --> 08:00.668
And where all did you serve then? You mean training 
and all? Yeah, what, did you stay in the United

08:03.788 --> 08:08.353
States all the time or did you go abroad? No, I went 
to what was then Camp Alfred Vale, Little Silver,

08:08.373 --> 08:14.940
New Jersey. It's now Fort Monmouth there, Signal 
Corps' main training camp.

08:23.269 --> 08:28.675
And from there I went to Fort Levmouth to a depot, 
which I ended up getting ready to go overseas. Went

08:29.136 --> 08:30.317
overseas.

08:33.098 --> 08:39.505
I first was a post signal officer at Bordeaux.

08:41.908 --> 08:56.523
Then they transferred me to Nevers,

08:41.908 --> 08:56.523
and from Nevers to Trier in Germany after the 
armistice was signed, and from Trier to Paris, and

08:41.908 --> 08:56.523
from then back home. Have any particular exciting 
experiences while you were there? No, it was very

09:00.267 --> 09:02.189
calm. I was an SOS all the time. There was nothing 
exciting going on. Okay. If we might jump back to

09:10.437 --> 09:14.041
your student days again for a couple of minutes.

09:17.184 --> 09:28.755
In looking through the Longhorns from your senior 
year, it had indication that you had sort of gone up

09:17.184 --> 09:28.755
the ranks in G Company. but that you were also a 
first lieutenant in the RV. How were you selected

09:34.097 --> 09:36.920
for the RV? Well, they had a secret vote. When I was 
there, you had to be voted on to get in. There were no

09:46.971 --> 09:49.774
scholastic requirements when I was there. How 
about military competence? Well, yes. That was a

09:53.878 --> 09:55.600
consideration, I'm sure. Well, I know it was 
because I voted on plenty of them. I thought you

09:59.735 --> 10:03.160
said you were in for how many years then? I went in in 
the fall of my junior year. We're in for junior and

10:08.867 --> 10:10.469
senior year. So you participated in the two vote, 
two elections.

10:17.379 --> 10:22.145
Who selected, I noticed you were first lieutenant 
in your senior year. How were you chosen to be first

10:22.906 --> 10:24.789
lieutenant? Voted on. Within the members of the 
RV, they elected all of the officers. Did being in

10:32.941 --> 10:38.507
the RV require a good bit more of your time than 
being in the regular corps of cadets? No. Just the

10:40.530 --> 10:41.511
drill. The drill was the only additional time we 
spent. We didn't

10:46.016 --> 10:52.064
devote any time to anything else. We didn't make 
any trips like the RVs do now. And there's this

10:56.452 --> 11:01.478
drill and exhibitions. We had exhibitions, of 
course, but those were usually on Sundays.

11:05.322 --> 11:07.785
Uh-huh. For whom would you have the exhibition? 
Oh, some dignitary that might come to school.

11:13.931 --> 11:18.877
Well, this would be the commandant would ask you to 
ask the RVs to give a demonstration. You were then

11:19.838 --> 11:21.660
kind of the crack drill team. Oh, yes. Yeah. OK. You 
were also a member, if you can remember this, of

11:27.890 --> 11:33.616
something referred to as the KK. Yeah. What did 
those initials stand for? Keelakinesis.

11:39.182 --> 11:48.993
K-E-L-A-K-E-N-K-E-N-E-S-I-S,

11:39.182 --> 11:48.993
I guess. And what was the function of that? It was a 
dance club, strictly a dance club. What kind of

11:54.459 --> 11:55.500
dances? Or dancing? Oh, ballroom dances all they 
ever did back in those days. Didn't do square

12:01.817 --> 12:02.678
dancing? No, no. It was near a fraternity, I guess 
you could say. Did this organization sponsor

12:08.544 --> 12:11.387
dances for the students? No, just for the club. 
Just for the club. How frequently did you have a

12:13.850 --> 12:15.372
dance? About two a year. And who would do the music? 
Who would provide the music? We'd bring in

12:19.977 --> 12:20.918
orchestras. Bring in an orchestra. How large of an 
organization was it then? 20 members. So you would

12:27.325 --> 12:40.758
then, with that small a membership, unless you had 
somebody to supply you with some money, you

12:27.325 --> 12:40.758
couldn't have brought in very much of a big-name 
orchestra then, I take it. Well, I don't know how

12:40.778 --> 12:48.446
they did it, I don't recall, but I know I chipped in 
and we paid to have orchestras come in. Of course,

12:48.946 --> 12:53.010
we know none of these big-name orchestras. Not 
like for the senior hop or something like that? No,

12:56.552 --> 12:56.692
no. Commencement hop. Any

12:58.894 --> 13:06.220
idea how old the organization was by the time you 
joined it? No, but I know that was supposed to be the

13:07.461 --> 13:09.503
end of it. 13 was supposed to be the end of it. 13 was 
the end of it. Was that by a decision? We were more or

13:14.267 --> 13:17.730
less sub Rosa my senior year. Was that the decision 
of the school then? Yeah, the school authorities.

13:23.247 --> 13:29.376
It got to be a little political down there between 
the Swastikas and the KKs. Who were the Swastikas?

13:31.018 --> 13:33.422
That was another organization like the KKs. For 
dances? Well, it was a dance club originally, but

13:35.084 --> 13:43.356
it got so political that they, oh, I won't say this. 
Some of my old Swastika friends might hear this.

13:48.784 --> 13:51.448
They didn't have a limited membership, I'll put it 
that way.

13:55.158 --> 13:57.602
So they had a larger membership. They had a larger 
membership than the KKs, yeah. And were you

14:00.185 --> 14:03.550
elected as a KK? How about the Swastikas? Were you 
elected to that too?

14:10.581 --> 14:14.707
But it was not as strict on who went in? Well, I don't 
know. We had certain requirements. I don't recall

14:20.816 --> 14:23.680
just exactly what they were. You had to be a decent 
type fellow. No financial requirements. You

14:32.187 --> 14:35.690
didn't have to be from rich parents or anything of 
that sort. Just kind of like getting into a

14:36.330 --> 14:39.333
fraternity, I'd say. And where did the girls come 
from for the dances that you had? All over the

14:43.777 --> 14:44.558
country. Oh, did you bring your girl from home 
primarily? Did any of the fellows have girls from

14:47.060 --> 14:50.203
Bryan to come for the dances? Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. 
What about any of the faculty daughters? Well...

14:55.013 --> 15:01.340
As I recall, there weren't any other there than the 
Gieske two daughters that were that age.

15:04.263 --> 15:05.564
So that kind of limited that. Yes.

15:14.554 --> 15:20.140
There was a girl from Brown married the Texas 
University coach that used to coach it then. The

15:20.220 --> 15:20.741
Bible? The Bible, the ex-Bible. Rowena Rose, she 
was what we called a college widow. And there was a

15:28.900 --> 15:43.173
girl named Brian, Dessie Weddington, and 
Madeline Hanway, who was Madeline Parker, and

15:28.900 --> 15:43.173
there was a slew of Brian girls. But they imported 
them. I imported one from Brian, from Beaumont all

15:45.796 --> 15:50.620
the time.

15:53.333 --> 15:59.201
The Longhorn also indicated you were manager of 
the Turnverein. Turnverein Club, yes. That was a

16:01.083 --> 16:08.212
club inside just an athletic club in the NG 
Company. We had room in the basement of Goodwin

16:08.933 --> 16:17.885
Hall, and we converted it into a gymnasium. We had 
boxing clubs and a punching bag. dumbbells and

16:23.202 --> 16:25.485
inning clubs and things like that. So what, you 
kind of took care of the equipment as manager of it?

16:28.629 --> 16:32.174
Yeah.

16:32.835 --> 16:37.221
Was this a common practice for... No, that's the 
only club of that type on the campus. Was the only

16:37.241 --> 16:40.946
one of that like that on campus? Did you just have a 
larger percentage of athletically inclined men

16:40.986 --> 16:47.575
in your company? No, I think we had a fellow named 
Clyde Griesenbeck that was athletically

16:52.683 --> 16:54.586
inclined. He didn't play football, baseball, or 
track or anything else, but he liked to keep the

16:54.606 --> 17:01.355
condition. And he formed that little club. Yeah, I 
imagine that was a fairly short-lived thing. It

17:08.706 --> 17:10.748
was in that one year. And then you said, I believe, 
you were manager of the basketball team. Yeah,

17:16.216 --> 17:20.462
that was A&M's first basketball team, too. What 
was your responsibility there? Well, take care of

17:22.905 --> 17:31.855
the equipment and, well, there wasn't much of 
anything to do other than that. But you made all the

17:32.636 --> 17:33.937
trips with the team. Made all the trips and looked 
after the finances of getting the money in. Of

17:40.644 --> 17:47.331
course, we played Houston High School and 
Galveston High School and the Galveston YMCA.

17:47.371 --> 17:49.774
That's about all the teams that were available. 
Those are the only two trips we made, one to Houston

17:50.598 --> 17:55.889
and one to Galveston. Then did you play some games 
on campus, too? Oh, yes. We played the high school,

17:58.053 --> 18:03.123
I don't recall. I believe we played the YMCA, 
Galveston YMCA on campus.

18:16.028 --> 18:20.274
Well, Monty Montgomery, he was a football player 
and a basketball player. I guess the star of that

18:22.117 --> 18:23.980
team.

18:30.349 --> 18:34.275
Gosh, when you get old as I am, names kind of slip 
away from you. I know what you mean. I'm somewhat

18:35.156 --> 18:39.282
younger than you are, and lots of names have 
slipped away from me. But Zeke Caldwell, whose

18:40.864 --> 18:45.411
father had a jewelry store in Bryan, There's still 
a Caldwell's Jewelry in Bryan. Is there? You

18:52.955 --> 18:58.503
graduated in the spring of 13. What did you do as 
your first job after you graduated? Well, I lived

19:03.370 --> 19:08.518
in San Angelo and my father had sold the ranch. 
Wasn't anything to do. I didn't want to be a cowboy.

19:13.966 --> 19:15.668
So I went to Dallas and Ran into a former Aggie, 
worked for Bell Telephone Company, and got a job

19:17.352 --> 19:29.348
with them in the traffic department.

19:29.368 --> 19:43.647
Became a traffic chief, what they called a traffic 
chief, and worked on through to the

19:29.368 --> 19:43.647
latter part of the 17.

19:46.732 --> 19:56.504
I was made Division Supervisor of Traffic at San 
Antonio, and that's when I got in the Army.

19:56.684 --> 20:00.689
What have you done, what did you do after you got out 
of the Army then? Oh, I got into the oil business

20:02.031 --> 20:09.941
down in the Eastland, Rangers, this and that. And 
what aspect of the oil business did you get into?

20:15.672 --> 20:16.253
Production. Production. Had a lease

20:16.973 --> 20:30.328
down near Ranger and also was in sales for a while.

20:36.315 --> 20:39.739
For how long did you do that?

20:44.697 --> 20:46.239
I'd say four or five years.

20:50.325 --> 20:51.827
What did you do next then? I went to work for the 
Federal Land Bank of Houston. The Farm Credit

20:55.312 --> 20:59.759
Administration signed with the Federal Land Bank 
of Houston. At what point? Do you remember what

21:00.580 --> 21:02.262
year that was? 1933. Where

21:04.426 --> 21:10.975
were you located first? here, Lubbock. You come 
directly to Lubbock in 1933 then, with the Federal

21:12.368 --> 21:18.216
Land Bank out of Houston. And you were in what 
capacity, an appraiser? Land Bank appraiser was

21:21.160 --> 21:24.764
the title. What was your, what did you do? 
Appraised farms and ranches for loans. This would

21:32.555 --> 21:35.138
be if somebody wanted to buy the farmland? Well, 
various purposes. They had They'd make loans for

21:39.524 --> 21:45.189
purchase of property, for improvement of 
property. And if you had something above a

21:47.311 --> 21:53.777
homestead, you could get money to buy cattle or 
equipment. You say something above a homestead?

21:56.480 --> 21:57.421
Yeah. 200 acres is a suburban homestead. So if you 
had more than 200 acres? More than 200 acres, yeah.

22:04.467 --> 22:08.451
You could borrow money to buy cattle or equipment.

22:11.300 --> 22:16.526
They've liberalized that a lot since I left. Of 
course you can't borrow in Texas, you can't create

22:17.668 --> 22:30.564
a loan on a homestead for anything other than 
purchase money or improvements.

22:30.584 --> 22:38.033
You can't borrow money on a homestead to buy 
livestock or invest in something else. But say, if

22:39.329 --> 22:46.981
you own more than 200 acres, but you don't live 
there, you can borrow money on it then, I take it. If

22:47.962 --> 22:49.504
it's not your place of residence. Well, let's say 
you own a section of land. You can cut off your

22:51.788 --> 22:54.392
homestead and borrow on the excess. Uh-huh. 320 
acres. You can cut off 120 acres and borrow on

22:58.698 --> 23:04.908
that. So for how long did you... worked for the 
Federal Land Bank then? Well, from 33 to 61.

23:13.224 --> 23:19.353
That's...

23:13.224 --> 23:19.353
Nearly 30 years. You're 29. I'm 29, yes. And you 
retired? Yeah. I've had my own appraisal and loan

23:25.782 --> 23:31.010
service since that time.

23:33.914 --> 23:36.478
You work pretty steadily, or do you kind of work 
when you want to? When I want to. I

23:38.020 --> 23:46.250
might work two or three cases a year, something 
like that. Now, how long a time would it, you say two

23:46.270 --> 23:52.898
or three cases, how much time would you put in on an 
individual case? Well, it depends on the size of

23:52.918 --> 23:55.362
it, of course.

23:58.626 --> 24:06.255
A farm, nominal size farm, would take from three to 
six, eight days. The ranch might take you a month.

24:13.840 --> 24:18.847
So since 61, then, you've been an appraiser. Are 
you gradually decreasing the amount of

24:18.887 --> 24:21.691
appraising you do? Well, that and I guess

24:22.533 --> 24:31.686
I'm not actively making loans anymore. I just quit 
that.

24:37.150 --> 24:37.992
I don't know. I had a heart attack in 68, so that 
slowed me down. That slowed you down a good bit,

24:41.378 --> 24:42.901
yeah. I was real active up until then, but since 
then I've slowed down considerably.

24:57.468 --> 24:59.930
You say you quit making loans, and were you... I was 
soliciting loans. I broker a loan, put it that way.

25:04.294 --> 25:11.061
In other words, you would act as a go-between 
between somebody who wanted to borrow money and

25:04.294 --> 25:11.061
somebody who had something to lend. Yeah. I 
represented the Prudential Insurance Company

25:11.841 --> 25:20.750
and Equitable Life Insurance Society. Those 
people would be interested in loaning fairly

25:21.611 --> 25:26.195
substantial amounts of money, I believe. Oh, 
yeah. They didn't have any limit to their loans.

25:29.677 --> 25:33.421
Did they have a minimum limit? Oh, it seemed to me 
like $2,500 was the least that they could.

25:37.006 --> 25:38.668
Normally it was $5,000. They didn't have a loan 
under

25:39.669 --> 25:43.755
that. Because it costs money to put loans on a book, 
you know, and service them. So you've got to have a

25:47.800 --> 25:53.547
good enough interest return to pay that. Uh-huh.

25:57.560 --> 26:06.130
Had you had any contact with any of these insurance 
companies previously for you to get started

25:57.560 --> 26:06.130
becoming a loan solicitor for them? Oh, yes. We 
appraised them. We hobnobbed with

26:10.636 --> 26:15.021
representatives of different companies. This 
was when you were an appraiser with the land bank.

26:19.426 --> 26:20.007
With the land bank, yes.

26:28.964 --> 26:30.126
I'm not a reprobate. I've been an

26:30.226 --> 26:36.915
elder in the Presbyterian Church for 40 years. I'd 
like to get that in there. Okay. We do want to record

26:39.859 --> 26:43.724
any other service you've done to the community. 
Well, being a land bank appraiser, I was in the

26:45.266 --> 26:48.651
country all the time. I do belong to Kiwanis Club 
now, and I have in time belonged to Rotary Club and

26:48.931 --> 26:56.862
Alliance Club. over the years, but until I 
retired, I didn't try to belong to any service club

26:58.073 --> 27:07.985
or take any active part in civic affairs. You might 
step back for a minute in your time with the land

27:09.827 --> 27:21.881
bank

27:09.827 --> 27:21.881
to ask how wide of an area did you cover when you were 
an appraiser? Well, when I worked at the land bank,

27:22.863 --> 27:27.388
I usually say I worked all Well, from north Texas, 
from Temple north, and from east and west, from El

27:28.972 --> 27:45.408
Paso to Louisiana and Oklahoma line. So you 
covered almost the entire state. Yeah. Since I

27:48.952 --> 27:54.557
retired, I've worked practically all of Texas and 
a good part of New Mexico.

27:56.984 --> 27:59.167
So you had a good bit of traveling to do. Yeah, I did. 
I was going home so much that I couldn't belong to a

27:59.768 --> 28:03.694
service club. Well, the land bank had appraisers 
in other areas. Oh, yeah. In fact, there was

28:09.703 --> 28:12.147
another one here in Lubbock.

28:15.191 --> 28:17.655
One in Plainview, one in Amarillo. They had quite a 
bit of loan business. How would they determine who

28:21.368 --> 28:27.016
would go to a particular location to appraise a 
piece of property? Well, when I first started,

28:28.778 --> 28:46.783
they would assign all the applications to one 
individual, and he would, in turn, he was in charge

28:28.778 --> 28:46.783
of a group of appraisers. That was in 1933 when they 
the Farm Loan Act went into effect in a big way. That

28:53.766 --> 29:03.039
is, they put on another 25% that they could loan and 
call it the commissioner loan. Farmers were all in

29:03.079 --> 29:06.944
terrible condition, and financially, you know. 
Insurance companies were pressing them. All

29:10.990 --> 29:16.418
lenders, all institutional lenders were really 
after them to pay off if they could.

29:19.283 --> 29:23.911
And this leader of the group would pass out the 
applications. Later, they got to signing them

29:24.192 --> 29:30.123
from the bank. I remember one weekend, just before 
Christmas, I was down at Steamboat. And the chief

29:38.277 --> 29:41.443
appraiser called me and told me that He was going to 
send me the next week way up in Follett, way up in the

29:42.908 --> 29:51.896
very northeast part of Texas, up in Lipscomb 
County. And I told him, I said, well, I'm going to

29:51.916 --> 29:54.899
stop home Christmas. You know that, don't you? He 
said, oh, yes, I'm sure.

30:00.884 --> 30:07.050
But they sent us all over. They wanted us to go.

30:10.793 --> 30:11.734
Later, they... The last two or three years, three 
or four years, the amount of time they assigned

30:12.963 --> 30:29.840
them, they let the Secretary of Treasuries assign 
me, the managers of these farm owners

30:12.963 --> 30:29.840
associations, to sign the applications. At that 
time we had a territory, but there was overlap on

30:29.860 --> 30:37.748
that. Wasn't that a hard and fast rule, staying 
either within a given territory?
