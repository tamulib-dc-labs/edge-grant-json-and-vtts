WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:03.582
This is clearly a field you're desperately 
concerned about.

00:07.106 --> 00:09.068
Yeah, good old jock. We've got a problem with him. 
I'm

00:10.530 --> 00:30.831
not sure that the ocean is really dying per se, but 
I've been up and down the east coast of the United

00:10.530 --> 00:30.831
States quite a bit, and within five, ten miles of 
the coast, I think that Since I've been out there,

00:32.026 --> 00:42.781
which is the last 10 or 15 years, we see a lot more 
garbage floating around, plastics in

00:32.026 --> 00:42.781
particular, things that never disappear. But I 
think as far as pollution effects go,

00:44.383 --> 00:56.820
I think we're selling the biota kind of short. I 
think they have a tremendous genetic variability

01:01.760 --> 01:10.390
within the population to survive

01:01.760 --> 01:10.390
a lot of these insults that we give them.

01:13.534 --> 01:24.807
What we end up doing is, in the worst aspect, well, 
in the worst aspect you just kill everything, but

01:13.534 --> 01:24.807
that usually doesn't happen in a very large area. 
It might be a localized effect. On the periphery of

01:28.291 --> 01:30.433
that, then we have a very strong natural selection 
force. We end up picking and choosing, well we

01:34.239 --> 01:59.914
don't, but the pollutant which I think once you get 
it down in concentration a little ways acts as any

01:34.239 --> 01:59.914
other environmental stress and what you end up 
doing is eliminating some species maybe, but we

01:34.239 --> 01:59.914
sure as heck select among the rest of the species so 
that we end up not really drastically changing the

02:00.535 --> 02:03.918
population. Once you get some undefined distance 
from the point source of your pollution, the

02:03.998 --> 02:18.792
experimental work going on up in Canada, there's a 
CPEX program that's controlled pollution

02:03.998 --> 02:18.792
environmental experiment or something like 
that. I forget what the acronym stands for. And

02:21.835 --> 02:28.821
their feeling has been that whenever they perturb 
the system with a pollutant, what we end up doing is

02:29.763 --> 02:47.346
speeding up the natural succession process that 
we see in the ocean every year, where we have an

02:29.763 --> 02:47.346
environmental stress when you get into high 
latitudes, you know, when winter comes, knocks

02:29.763 --> 02:47.346
things off, and then when it warms up again next 
year, then things come back again. And I think the

02:48.988 --> 02:57.880
scientists involved up there have gotten to the 
point where they think of pollution input as just

02:48.988 --> 02:57.880
another environmental stress. And so that the 
natural population, the ambient population,

02:58.805 --> 03:18.835
because they do have in each individual species 
some reasonable range in the genetic

02:58.805 --> 03:18.835
capabilities of it, I don't think we're going to 
see pollution just killing everything right off.

03:18.855 --> 03:23.983
You might end up, again, in localized areas with 
some rather peculiar effects. The work we were

03:24.043 --> 03:26.787
doing down in Long Island was a case in point. And 
what had happened down there was there are two

03:29.580 --> 03:38.652
major areas in the United States where they raise 
ducks for commercial purposes. And the ducks are

03:40.174 --> 03:43.979
so darn efficient, all they do is excrete uric acid 
and sand. That's about the only thing that comes

03:43.999 --> 03:46.222
out the back end of them. You put grain in the front, 
and that's what comes out the back. And there's

03:49.006 --> 03:56.976
such heavy concentrations on these little 
estuaries that it's just like dumping trainloads

03:49.006 --> 03:56.976
of fertilizer in there every day. did in the bay 
itself was so alter the nutrient chemistry that

03:57.547 --> 04:07.041
what they ended up doing was selecting for a 
certain kind of an organism. It turned out to be a

04:07.742 --> 04:13.891
little green algae that swam around instead of the 
normal diatoms. Well, what it did was it wiped out

04:13.951 --> 04:16.255
the blue point oyster.

04:19.219 --> 04:24.567
Again, you know, this is, I guess it depends on what 
size you want to look at the ocean. If you're

04:27.475 --> 04:32.283
looking at the ocean as a whole, you can sort of 
shake your head and say, well, what difference

04:27.475 --> 04:32.283
does it make? If you happen to be a blue point oyster 
connoisseur, well, that's death. And so it

04:35.749 --> 04:41.019
depends on what your point of view is on the sort of 
thing. In Great South Bay, what they ended up

04:41.840 --> 04:47.751
doing, it turned out to be a very confusing 
problem. The boaters wanted to maintain a couple

04:49.150 --> 04:56.080
channels that would be open so they could get their 
boats in and out, but that's not historically the

04:49.150 --> 04:56.080
way the place has been. A hurricane came along at 
one point and broke the barrier island, increased

04:57.682 --> 05:06.415
the flushing rate of the bay, and sure enough, the 
oysters started growing again. Well, the Corps of

05:06.455 --> 05:18.533
Engineers said, this can't be, so they filled the 
inlet in, and of course what happened was that the

05:06.455 --> 05:18.533
area was taken over by this little green algae 
again.

05:22.394 --> 05:34.248
As far as major pollution effects in the ocean, I 
think what a lot of the people are talking about are

05:22.394 --> 05:34.248
such low numbers. I mean, they have to go out and 
document it. They have to measure it some way. And

05:38.674 --> 05:44.661
more often than not, our own analytical 
capabilities aren't enough to snuff. And so we're

05:44.681 --> 05:45.642
just guessing. We don't know whether we can 
demonstrate a pollution effect in most of the

05:46.944 --> 05:52.350
ocean.

05:53.562 --> 06:00.352
Again, if you look at where they've been dumping 
the sludge off New York, sure as heck you can find

05:53.562 --> 06:00.352
that effect there. But again, it's a matter of 
scale. My own preference is I would much rather

06:04.819 --> 06:08.524
have them dump it out there than in my backyard. And 
as long as we are involved with,

06:09.506 --> 06:20.903
say, sewage system, garbage collection systems, 
and things like this, Probably the ocean's a

06:21.777 --> 06:26.542
reasonably good place to put it, mainly because I 
can't think of a better place. I'd just as soon not

06:27.483 --> 06:30.326
have it, but we've got it. Another case in point in 
our department is that I hate like heck to see him go

06:31.908 --> 06:44.342
out from the galley three times a day and hurl that 
stuff over the side of the boat.

06:45.976 --> 06:47.198
This is a very minor thing. Even if you take all the 
ships in the world and things like this, we're

06:47.658 --> 06:55.568
still talking about a minor input of plastics, 
aluminum, floating bottles, and things like

06:47.658 --> 06:55.568
this. So we thought, wouldn't it be neat if we got a 
compactor on the ship and would take out the

06:57.411 --> 07:07.784
non-biodegradable materials and would haul them 
back home again? And it turns out that the only

07:09.666 --> 07:13.391
place we can get rid of this is in Seattle. If we come 
into Los Angeles with it, they won't let us offload

07:13.411 --> 07:15.814
it. mainly because the Port of Los Angeles can't 
handle it. They've got their own garbage problems

07:19.853 --> 07:22.677
out there. And so I think most people 
idealistically wouldn't want to put anything

07:23.578 --> 07:30.507
into the ocean. The same thing, they don't want to 
put it in their backyard. They want to put it in

07:32.930 --> 07:35.834
somebody else's backyard, perhaps. But the real 
problem is that we've got a system set up to collect

07:36.695 --> 07:44.265
garbage, collect sewage. And we just can't put a 
cork in them. We just can't stop them. And I think,

07:48.256 --> 07:56.608
again, dumping them in the ocean is probably one of 
the better places to put it right now. I mean,

07:56.789 --> 07:59.072
because we don't have any other place to put it. If 
you didn't generate the material, of course, then

07:59.092 --> 08:04.580
you're a fat city. We're having the same problem 
out where I live. We're in a rural area, and they put

08:13.422 --> 08:15.865
little school, an elementary school up the road 
from us. According to state law, it has to be

08:15.905 --> 08:18.307
serviced by a sewer. And nobody else has sewers out 
there. And I'm just opposed to sewers in general,

08:21.671 --> 08:31.462
because that's, from sort of a moralistic point of 
view, I view that as going and throwing my garbage

08:21.671 --> 08:31.462
over the fence into my neighbor's yard. And at 
least we're in an area now out there where if they

08:32.503 --> 08:42.214
control the housing density, they don't have to go 
to sewers. Because if they run a sewer in, what's

08:42.886 --> 08:54.941
going to happen is they're going to trip the area 
into a concentrated building, because then

08:42.886 --> 08:54.941
they'll be permitted to build five houses per 
acre, the present time of one house per acre. But my

08:56.303 --> 09:03.292
argument would be, don't run a sewer in there, 
because then you don't create the population

08:56.303 --> 09:03.292
demand that needs a sewer. I'm not sure which is the 
chicken and which is the egg, but if we can keep, if

09:04.393 --> 09:10.581
you can generate a system so that you don't 
generate the problem, then you don't have to solve

09:12.653 --> 09:17.439
it. So I'm not sure. Again, getting back to the 
pollution effects or pollution of the ocean as a

09:19.802 --> 09:36.703
whole,

09:19.802 --> 09:36.703
I think it would be extremely difficult to stop 
dumping this kind of material. mainly because we

09:37.544 --> 09:40.028
just don't have any other place to put it. And it's a 
historical fact. I mean, New York City is serviced

09:41.511 --> 09:43.374
by sewers. And part of the product of the sewer is 
sludge. And I forget what the numbers involved

09:49.884 --> 09:58.759
are, but the magnitude of this thing, it just sort 
of boggles your mind.

10:00.005 --> 10:02.088
You know, we make jokes. Sure, we'll send it to 
Louisiana or someplace, you know, Oklahoma,

10:02.148 --> 10:11.002
Arizona, you know, as long as it's far enough away 
from my backyard. But it's sort of a situation

10:11.042 --> 10:17.933
where you can't... I don't think you can have an 
ideal solution. I think you have to make a

10:20.797 --> 10:22.320
compromise. It's trade-offs. And hopefully this 
is where... we can get away from some of this

10:28.135 --> 10:40.654
emotionalism that's been associated with the 
pollution problem so that hopefully the

10:28.135 --> 10:40.654
scientific community can give somebody some 
alternatives. They might all be bad, but at least

10:42.357 --> 10:48.527
you're not stuck with just throwing up your hands 
and saying nothing can be done. I think, again, if

10:49.168 --> 10:55.257
you trace back the environmental movement,

10:57.633 --> 11:20.726
It seemed to me that most of the people involved 
were either extremely clever or rather

10:57.633 --> 11:20.726
dimwitted, and that they just said, stop it, but 
never seemed to pay much attention to the fact that

10:57.633 --> 11:20.726
you probably couldn't really stop the problem.

11:21.988 --> 11:24.872
The good that has come out of it has probably been 
that it's made people in government or in the areas

11:26.084 --> 11:36.080
where they make these kinds of decisions to 
perhaps think about it a little bit. Because there

11:36.341 --> 11:40.668
are, I mean, I am hopeful that there are some 
alternatives. I mean, we don't have to keep going

11:40.848 --> 11:44.694
the old way over and over again. We'd like to think 
that you learn something from history, although

11:44.754 --> 11:53.408
sometimes you wonder.

11:55.295 --> 11:58.820
Again, I don't think the ocean is dying, per se. I 
think it's, again, it's a matter of scale. If we

12:03.828 --> 12:08.755
talk about the ocean as a whole, I don't think it's 
dying. If you look at some localized areas, which a

12:09.416 --> 12:19.251
localized area might be 100 square kilometers, 
yeah, we sure as heck have made some sort of impact.

12:20.553 --> 12:23.698
But if we look at some of the larger natural 
phenomena, I'm thinking of things like the El Nino

12:25.012 --> 12:34.267
of South America, which is an environmental 
catastrophe that happens every ten years. It's

12:35.810 --> 12:46.868
not so bad now, but apparently in historical 
times, thousands and thousands of people would

12:35.810 --> 12:46.868
die because either they'd get flooded out or 
they'd starve to death. I mean, granted, the birds

12:47.607 --> 12:49.950
all died. We're talking about tens of millions and 
20 million birds die in a year because they started

12:50.190 --> 12:58.402
that.

12:58.482 --> 13:04.169
Again, the ocean has a fair amount of resiliency. 
It can bounce back from these insults. The other

13:08.776 --> 13:15.825
thing that I sort of tried to talk up was that The 
oceans themselves are changing over time. These

13:20.779 --> 13:29.770
are natural fluctuations that have to do with 
whether the North Pole goes to north-south or

13:20.779 --> 13:29.770
whether it's in some other orientation, a 
magnetic North Pole. We've had large-scale

13:30.832 --> 13:39.703
climatic changes that have tremendous impacts, 
and some of these things have been Well, I guess the

13:40.814 --> 13:48.441
easiest one to demonstrate is a lot of species that 
were around a million years ago aren't here

13:40.814 --> 13:48.441
anymore. And they've been exterminated. And 
whether it was a biological extermination or a

13:50.103 --> 13:57.450
climatic extermination, we don't really know. 
But just in historical times, we can demonstrate,

13:58.331 --> 14:07.800
at least in the fish catch literature from the 
oceans, that there have been major perturbations

14:08.354 --> 14:10.797
in the oceans over the last five, six hundred 
years. The fall of the Hanseatic League on the

14:12.199 --> 14:18.407
Baltic is probably a climatic thing. The herring 
that they made their living on disappeared, and

14:18.487 --> 14:25.276
it's probably a result of climatic changes. The 
literature in Japan on the movement of the herring

14:27.099 --> 14:37.112
fishery around the islands for the last five, six 
hundred years show major fluctuations in the

14:37.784 --> 14:43.229
hydrographic characteristics in that region. So 
I guess sort of what you boil this thing down to is,

14:44.470 --> 14:55.640
what's the natural condition of the ocean? Is it 
the one we see now, or the one we want, or the one

14:55.900 --> 15:02.866
we're going to get because of natural processes? 
And I think there have been some clear examples of

15:08.176 --> 15:14.004
man's impact, i.e., the brown pelican and the DDT 
story.

15:16.647 --> 15:27.121
But if you look at the small zooplankton or the 
zooplankton in the North Sea, which has been

15:16.647 --> 15:27.121
changing over the last 25 years, it's been 
documented.

15:29.964 --> 15:32.007
Who knows what's the cause of that? The 
unfortunate thing is that there's not enough

15:32.257 --> 15:35.821
environmental data to go with this thing. We don't 
know what the sea surface temperature is and

15:35.841 --> 15:51.559
things like this for the same period of time, but 
we've had a significant change in this species

15:35.841 --> 15:51.559
composition and probably total biomass of the 
small animals that the fish feed on, and of course

15:35.841 --> 15:51.559
we catch the fish. The irony of the thing is that I 
think they're catching more fish now than they

15:52.320 --> 16:00.930
have 25 years ago, but we're not quite sure what 
sort of effect, you know, cause and effect on that

16:01.636 --> 16:05.123
sort of thing. As a matter of fact, I wrote a paper 
with some other people at an airport once. We were

16:10.113 --> 16:21.636
over in Plymouth, England doing a workshop for 
UNESCO, or SCORE, I forget which one it was. about

16:22.240 --> 16:27.085
how do you monitor life in the ocean, how do you 
detect changes. And so we were sitting down there

16:27.906 --> 16:40.701
and we're all reeling off these little cases we 
know of, of catastrophes happening in the ocean

16:27.906 --> 16:40.701
where all fish populations would disappear and 
things like this. And like I said, we were sitting

16:40.721 --> 16:50.712
there in Heathrow and there was a Swede and a German 
and there was a Japanese guy and a couple guys from

16:40.721 --> 16:50.712
Canada and some from here. So we're all waiting for 
planes. And in a period of half an hour, we decided,

16:53.445 --> 17:16.564
well, we'll write this thing up, and we'll send it 
into a journal, sort of demonstrating that

16:53.445 --> 17:16.564
there's probably no steady state equilibrium 
condition in the ocean, and that probably some of

16:53.445 --> 17:16.564
the things that people were attributing to man's 
influence was probably just sliding over the top

17:17.084 --> 17:26.317
of this natural variation that has happened ever 
since we've had records. So

17:26.337 --> 17:35.070
there's a certain amount of truth to the old 
engineering adage that the solution to pollution

17:26.337 --> 17:35.070
is dilution. And again, taking sort of a practical 
point of view, is that we're probably stuck with

17:35.911 --> 17:46.146
this for quite some time.

17:47.122 --> 18:00.115
We're not always happy with it, but I think if you 
take somewhat a realistic point of view of what's

17:47.122 --> 18:00.115
happening in the country and the world, we

17:47.122 --> 18:00.115
might be able to do it better. But at the present 
time, I don't see us being able, in a realistic sort

18:01.116 --> 18:16.572
of a sense, being able to devote the resources that 
are required to pull off these kinds of problems.

18:17.092 --> 18:26.462
Again, another one which just bugs the living heck 
out of me is the gasoline stuff, the oil.

18:29.805 --> 18:38.774
To try to knock off the emissions, to try to knock 
off the lead, what we've done is we've made cars

18:29.805 --> 18:38.774
heavier and heavier and heavier. So we end up using 
more gas per mile to go from point A to point B. If you

18:44.581 --> 18:53.333
look at the Japanese cars and some of the European 
cars, per mile travel, they put out a lot less

18:44.581 --> 18:53.333
emissions than we do. I think one of the reasons is 
they've been paying a buck and a half a gallon for

18:53.353 --> 18:57.399
gas for a long time. Maybe that's the kind of a spur 
you need to get at that sort of thing, rather than

18:58.961 --> 19:12.040
these catalytic converters and all this emission 
control stuff we have on our cars, which keeps

18:58.961 --> 19:12.040
making them heavier and heavier and heavier. we 
end up putting out more fumes per mile driven than

19:12.965 --> 19:25.302
if we put the economic burr on them to make them 
lighter and to try to get better mileage. It's sort

19:26.784 --> 19:28.707
of a game you play.

19:30.990 --> 19:37.299
It's like almost any other problem that you face in 
a laboratory. You might have to trade off one thing

19:37.319 --> 19:41.284
to get another. And in view of the fact that there 
must be, I don't know how much oil there is in the

19:41.686 --> 19:49.033
whole world, but there must be some finite limit to 
it. Maybe it behooves us to try to stretch it out as

19:50.174 --> 19:52.936
long as possible. And I think the environmental, 
in retrospect, I think this environmental

19:53.497 --> 20:10.832
concern is going to be viewed as a pretty heavy cost 
that we've paid to try to control emissions by

19:53.497 --> 20:10.832
going the route that we have done, rather than 
going the other way of given it the emphasis to go to

20:12.533 --> 20:16.057
lighter vehicles. So

20:17.299 --> 20:27.230
again, it goes back to how do you make decisions on 
this sort of a thing?

20:30.134 --> 20:37.382
The environmental issue is sure a hot, emotional 
issue there. And I think if the government doesn't

20:37.522 --> 20:42.388
screw it up,

20:43.921 --> 20:47.686
I think they've put the blanket on it, and you don't 
hear so much about it now. A lot of these things have

20:47.706 --> 20:59.460
been enacted into legislation, and hopefully 
they don't just bury it in bureaucracy and

20:47.706 --> 20:59.460
government inertia. But again, I think the 
scientific community can come up with some

20:59.600 --> 21:06.989
reasonable alternatives. What if? If you do this, 
what happens? If you do that, what happens?

21:15.072 --> 21:22.082
that kind of a game was played on a lot of 
environmental issues, but hopefully they will in

21:15.072 --> 21:22.082
the future. Is that the direction your work is 
taking you now? No, actually, I'm playing fun and

21:26.628 --> 21:29.192
games. No, not quite. If

21:31.255 --> 21:40.067
you go back and look at what I've done 
professionally, I've sort of go back and forth and

21:41.127 --> 21:53.240
I get sort of problem oriented, sort of mission 
oriented, and then I get back into sort of the real

21:41.127 --> 21:53.240
academic kinds of things. The major problem I'm 
working on right now is transport of materials

21:54.401 --> 22:04.972
from the surface down through the water column and 
eventually onto the sea floor. I got started into

22:06.574 --> 22:10.358
this thing primarily by the question, how do 
animals on the bottom of the ocean make a living?

22:18.183 --> 22:26.835
From any practical point of view, that's probably 
kind of a ridiculous

22:18.183 --> 22:26.835
problem to be working on. It turns out it's one of 
the big unknowns in biological oceanography. But

22:31.702 --> 22:35.427
on the total overall working ecosystem, it 
probably doesn't make any difference. But it

22:35.988 --> 22:40.935
turned out to be a problem that was rather 
interesting. was largely unworked. So it gives

22:44.039 --> 22:54.890
you the satisfaction of working in an area that you 
can come up with new ideas, new answers at least, or

22:44.039 --> 22:54.890
at least data to where none existed before. So from 
that point of view, it's very satisfying. On the

23:00.315 --> 23:06.001
outside of our effort, we've got a bunch of 
chemists playing around. We provide them with

23:06.662 --> 23:09.184
samples and materials. And these people are 
involved with hydrocarbon pollution and trace

23:09.468 --> 23:14.313
metal pollution and stuff like this. So we're sort 
of providing a service to some of the people who

23:14.333 --> 23:23.242
are, I guess you would call them environmentally 
oriented. I've gotten into the deep ocean mining

23:24.444 --> 23:29.929
problem.

23:33.153 --> 23:38.378
Again, basically the tool that we use are some 
sediment traps. which we played around with.

23:41.139 --> 23:42.761
We've designed them and developed them here. And 
they're probably as good as anybody else's. And

23:46.085 --> 23:47.827
we've been in the game for about two years. But the 
thing that got us into the deep ocean mining

23:48.648 --> 24:03.445
problem was that you suck up all these nodules and 
the slurry and everything else, bring it up, sieve

23:48.648 --> 24:03.445
out the nodules, and you dump this other stuff back 
over the side. What's the environmental impact?

24:05.628 --> 24:18.687
Well, at least in that case, you can actually 
define some realistic scientific questions that

24:05.628 --> 24:18.687
you can actually go out and take some measurements 
and answer, which isn't usually the way it works.

24:21.010 --> 24:31.686
So in this place, in this particular project, 
we're providing, again, basically a support

24:21.010 --> 24:31.686
service.

24:32.240 --> 24:52.362
We have defined a bunch of actual questions that 
are ecologically important, and they're also

24:32.240 --> 24:52.362
phrased scientifically, so you can go out and take 
a couple measurements, not a couple, but you can go

24:32.240 --> 24:52.362
out and actually measure it, rather than sitting 
over a couple cans of beer and, you know, there's a

24:32.240 --> 24:52.362
lot of rhetoric about it. I was involved with the 
SST thing with the ozone layer, and again, that we

25:02.632 --> 25:20.790
were able to

25:02.632 --> 25:20.790
structure the questions in such a way that they 
were, again, of importance to the environmental

25:02.632 --> 25:20.790
question, the ecological type thing, are we 
killing everything, and this sort of thing. But

25:21.370 --> 25:31.120
again, we could frame them into a scientific 
context so that you could actually do some

25:21.370 --> 25:31.120
experiments and measurements, get some data, and 
actually test them. Again, this is sort of

25:32.078 --> 25:36.885
combining the best of both sides. I mean, here you 
have an interesting, again, it's an interesting

25:37.105 --> 25:40.750
little scientific problem. It's got a start, 
middle, and a finish, you know, when you're done

25:41.311 --> 25:43.815
with it. It also was

25:45.297 --> 25:51.926
of interest to the environmental people.

25:55.792 --> 26:01.039
But I don't see that that kind of a program comes 
very easy. Either you're lucky and you can fall

26:01.593 --> 26:08.923
into it, or it's the right people at the right time 
at the right place. But to try to manage something

26:10.165 --> 26:13.630
like that I think would be extremely difficult. I 
really don't know how you make these things work.

26:18.337 --> 26:27.870
I've been involved with a number of these kinds of 
efforts in the past, and when I look back at them,

26:28.947 --> 26:33.212
trying to figure out why they worked or why they 
didn't work. There are no principles. There's no

26:35.515 --> 26:38.838
such management. You just can't come up with any 
management principles on this sort of a thing. But

26:44.485 --> 26:52.654
yeah, I've been involved with, like I said, 
sometimes kind of academic, sometimes

26:44.485 --> 26:52.654
mission-oriented things. And I'm not sure why I 
flopped from one to the other. Well, okay, when I

26:58.597 --> 27:13.239
was with the ultraviolet light work, after we did 
our thing and we sort of came to some conclusions,

26:58.597 --> 27:13.239
we had a fair amount of pressure on us to change our 
mind. And so I think I sort of shied away from that

27:14.481 --> 27:20.470
and then I got into my more academic approach now 
that I've been doing for the last couple of years.

27:24.695 --> 27:37.255
The SST ozone stuff I did in 73 and 74 and since then 
I've been more or less looking at gross food chain

27:24.695 --> 27:37.255
dynamics in the ocean again. The deep ocean mining 
thing is something that's kind of a small project

27:37.295 --> 27:44.466
that probably a one-shot deal as far as I'm 
concerned. My involvement will probably be a

27:48.115 --> 27:52.639
one-shot deal this October, and that'll be the end 
of it. But again, it was, it's the kind of, it got

27:52.939 --> 28:05.512
defined in such a way that I think even the most 
academic type people probably wouldn't object to

27:52.939 --> 28:05.512
being involved in it. But it's, again, it was the 
right time, right place, right people type of a

28:08.254 --> 28:14.200
situation. But again, drawing more and more 
people into the so-called environmentally

28:14.973 --> 28:33.059
directed, oriented kind of problems, I guess the 
biggest thing that always happens is that they

28:14.973 --> 28:33.059
find out they can't answer any questions. They 
either phrase the question at such a level that no

28:34.682 --> 28:42.313
mortal can answer them. Or if they finally get down 
to the nitty gritty, they find out there's no

28:43.036 --> 28:46.280
database. And so that you end up trying to solve 
these things using all sorts of other inputs. And

28:56.595 --> 29:04.405
maybe social economic things are the things that 
sort of solve these questions anyway. When

29:04.746 --> 29:09.753
Congress gets around to it, I think we're talking 
about votes and things like that. And maybe that's

29:11.055 --> 29:12.857
the area where they should be solved. But I think 
the scientists should be able to hopefully give

29:13.141 --> 29:19.729
them some alternatives. Of course, being here in 
Seattle and now that the Alaskan pipeline has

29:20.650 --> 29:35.469
finally gotten started, we're still writhing 
over, what are we going to do with the oil once we get

29:20.650 --> 29:35.469
it into the boats out there? Los Angeles says they 
don't want it. People around here say we don't want

29:39.855 --> 29:42.658
it.

29:44.140 --> 30:00.847
Maybe what they've got to do is build a port 
somewhere out here, and rather than saying, oh,

29:44.140 --> 30:00.847
we've got to be careful, we're not going to have any 
oil spills, maybe what they ought to say is, look,

29:44.140 --> 30:00.847
we're going to have an oil spill, what are we going 
to do about it? Rather than trying to prevent the

30:01.268 --> 30:10.603
oil spill, maybe they ought to make the 
assumption, because the probability of an oil

30:01.268 --> 30:10.603
spill is one, it's going to happen, and say, okay, 
Let's dump some money into it and let's forget

30:11.647 --> 30:21.381
about the environmental impact study of worrying 
about all the little wigglies and crawlies in the

30:11.647 --> 30:21.381
bottom. They're going to die when the oil gets 
there. Let's do some engineering studies on it and

30:23.845 --> 30:37.705
figure out how we can keep it there rather than 
letting it slip out of the port and come sloshing

30:23.845 --> 30:37.705
down straight to the one that fugues into Puget 
Sound.
