WEBVTT

00:03.828 --> 00:10.736
key campus leaders, deans and faculty members and 
so forth in the late 40s and early 50s? Well, Mr.

00:11.297 --> 00:21.009
D.W. Williams was chairman of the Athletic 
Council and I remember going to LSU one time with

00:11.297 --> 00:21.009
Bones Irving. Bones had forgotten to make a 
reservation for the football team and Mr.

00:22.070 --> 00:31.962
Williams was waiting for Bones to get there and he 
said, you never confirmed the reservations. But

00:32.465 --> 00:42.440
Mr. Penberthy followed as chairman of the 
Athletic Council and was very active. And was the

00:42.460 --> 00:47.008
council an important organization for 
athletics? Yes. Chris Grinman. Dr. Chris Grinman

00:50.393 --> 00:54.439
was chairman of the Athletic Council when Bear 
Bryant came. Was he already the department head in

00:55.516 --> 00:58.640
industrial ed by then? I think he was by that time, 
yes. What about the deans? Who were they? Well, let

01:03.226 --> 01:04.487
me think a minute. The dean of agriculture was Dr. 
Shepardson. Charles Shepardson later became a

01:10.174 --> 01:16.102
member of the board of the Federal Fair Bank. He was 
head of the Dairy Science

01:16.122 --> 01:22.570
Department. Dean Kyle, back in the early days, 
when I first came back. No, he'd already been gone

01:27.252 --> 01:29.734
by then. When I was a student, Dean Kyle would be 
back in Washington. And one of these, somewhere

01:34.778 --> 01:38.841
around here, signed by Dean Kyle. Engineering, of 
course, was Gilchrist, followed by Bolton,

01:38.921 --> 01:52.113
Dean Bolton, Dean of Engineering, Gilchrist, 
Dean of Engineering. Agriculture was Patterson,

01:54.173 --> 01:56.035
R.E. Patterson. Arts and Sciences. Arts and 
Sciences.

02:02.362 --> 02:04.424
Early as a student, Dean T.D. Brooks. And later, 
when Earl came in, Brother Frank Hewitt. Before

02:12.432 --> 02:13.153
him. Before him. Wait a second. Abbott. Dr. John 
Paul Abbott. Dr. Abbott. In Vet Medicine. In Vet

02:22.022 --> 02:23.083
Medicine. was back in the early days, was Dean 
about Ohio State as Dean Armstead.

02:53.067 --> 02:53.588
Price. Slick out and was in the late 50s. Yeah, and 
the one back prior to him was Armstead and Bouton.

03:07.148 --> 03:15.360
Dean Bouton was an Ohio State graduate, a good man, 
salty, tough.

03:16.702 --> 03:22.450
And prior

03:16.702 --> 03:22.450
to somebody there was Dean Marshdown. As far as you 
were aware, if there was a tug of war between the

03:23.105 --> 03:32.295
deans, who had the most influence? Which of the 
schools? Well, there was a tug of war between

03:36.500 --> 03:43.728
agriculture and all the rest of it. The Department 
of Agriculture always felt like they were

03:43.748 --> 03:49.514
mistreated. And they were working. And they were. 
it worked to try to get their share of everything.

03:55.588 --> 04:00.016
Now did the others feel that agriculture was 
getting more than its share? I suspect so. I

04:02.140 --> 04:07.390
suspect so, though I never heard anyone just come 
out and say so. But, well, Vincent, of course, was

04:07.410 --> 04:12.720
an engineer.

04:15.670 --> 04:22.320
You know, some of the schools I think really were 
mistreated, like the school of veterinary

04:15.670 --> 04:22.320
medicine. I think they were terribly mistreated. 
I think Dean Hubert made a wonderful dean, Dean

04:27.688 --> 04:32.475
Franklin. Before we get to him, let's move up and 
bring this man Rudder here. Okay. Did you know who

04:38.844 --> 04:40.807
Rudder was? Absolutely. Okay. Earl Rutter was 
living in Brady. He owned a drug store with his

04:50.424 --> 04:53.627
brother. He was working as a vice president of an 
aviation company in Brady that were

04:54.789 --> 05:06.462
manufacturing wings as a subcontractor for some 
aircraft factory. I can't tell you who it was, what

05:06.482 --> 05:12.609
airplane it was. My father had contracted to sell 
some land up in Hunt County under the Texas

05:13.687 --> 05:22.880
Veterans Land Program, Baskin-Gines.

05:22.900 --> 05:29.630
And that contract had been going for six months or 
eight months and never put here anything. Earl

05:29.650 --> 05:34.658
Rudder had been on our executive board of our 
association. Earl Rudder had been on our council.

05:39.685 --> 05:39.745
And Earl Rutter talked to me many hours about A&M 
and the relationship at the time between the

05:41.969 --> 06:01.728
so-called system officers

05:41.969 --> 06:01.728
and the university officers. And that there was a 
serious conflict. And Earl was just as pure in

06:02.589 --> 06:10.356
heart as any person you could ever find. He served 
as mayor, didn't he? He served as mayor of Brady for

06:12.928 --> 06:16.892
six or eight years. He was also Lyndon Johnson's 
campaign manager in West Texas, where Colt

06:18.113 --> 06:31.125
Stevenson had been for years and years and years. 
But Burrell served as Lyndon's campaign manager,

06:31.145 --> 06:38.993
did a real good job for him. When Bascom Giles was 
convicted or was indicted or whatever,

06:40.475 --> 06:57.918
Earl Rudder went to Austin to see Alan Shivers.

07:00.881 --> 07:09.773
There was a man from Brady that Earl wanted to 
recommend to the governor to be appointed as Land

07:00.881 --> 07:09.773
Commissioner for the state of Texas. And Earl went 
into Governor Shivers office and made his speech.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.321
And Alan Shivers listened to the speech. And when 
it was over, Alan says, I'm not going to appoint

07:25.264 --> 07:32.174
your man to this position. I'm going to appoint 
you. And did so. And I had known Earl very well up to

07:37.883 --> 07:43.048
that point. And the first day at his office, I 
called Earl and said, can I come see you? He said,

07:47.612 --> 07:49.573
sure, come on down. And I drove down there to talk to 
him about my father's business, his farms that

07:49.593 --> 08:00.323
he'd contract to sell. But anyway, I visited him. 
He got it all straightened out pretty quick. I

08:06.470 --> 08:13.319
don't remember what years he served as Land 
Commissioner, but I know he came to end. Let me say

08:13.339 --> 08:16.544
this, my father died in 54. He died before the 
launch was sold. So,

08:21.250 --> 08:33.186
sometime I think about in 54, probably Earl went to 
Austin, maybe 55. He served as land commissioner

08:34.381 --> 08:52.124
until the fall of 57 when the board

08:34.381 --> 08:52.124
went to Austin and talked him into coming up here as 
vice president, laying him under Tom Harrington.

08:52.144 --> 09:02.017
Now, can you identify who or whom was it, may have 
been more than one, who kind of said, Rudder is the

08:52.144 --> 09:02.017
person we want? Let me think. I

09:04.773 --> 09:18.247
can't do that. You're also indicating by your lack 
of mentioning of it that there wasn't some former

09:18.347 --> 09:32.181
student who went to the board or there wasn't a 
campaign for him that they sat down and thought,

09:18.347 --> 09:32.181
who do we want? Let me say this, that in those years, 
let's say 51 to 57, Earl was very active in the

09:32.937 --> 09:46.975
association. And he was very closely associated 
with people like Harold Dunn, Rufus Peoples.

09:56.126 --> 10:01.493
People who were both very active in the 
association and say on the Board of Directors, and

10:02.131 --> 10:18.453
Polly Krueger, and Rufus Peoples, and Harold 
Dunn. And so, when we got to the point where we

10:18.473 --> 10:29.527
needed somebody to take over the administration 
of this institution, we needed that. We needed

10:29.547 --> 10:30.328
that. I think The impetus, if I had to name 
somebody, would be Harold. What was not happening

10:36.602 --> 10:38.765
here then? Instead of saying what was going wrong, 
I'll say what wasn't happening. We had no

10:42.570 --> 10:47.036
continuity of leadership. We had had president 
after president after president. And we had the

10:51.062 --> 10:58.491
presidents that we had were acting or temporary or 
not here for long. And they were just people

10:59.473 --> 11:01.315
that... did not want to run the risk of fighting the 
system or changing the system or creating

11:02.999 --> 11:16.138
problems that would be detrimental to their 
well-being. And so just nothing got done. I think

11:18.942 --> 11:32.061
primarily they wouldn't face up to the realities 
of life with the court and the non-coeducation.

11:32.783 --> 11:33.304
All right. David Morgan came as president as an 
outsider. David Morgan came as a total outsider

11:36.969 --> 11:44.479
from Colorado.

11:44.679 --> 11:49.826
And David Morgan tried to do the best he could. But 
that was at a point when I guess our enrollment was

11:49.846 --> 12:00.982
at the lowest that has been almost in the history of 
this institution. I think in 1953, Our enrollment

12:02.669 --> 12:07.776
total was 53

12:02.669 --> 12:07.776
students. Now, was he a capable man? Yes. That's 
what I've heard from others. He was a very capable

12:13.404 --> 12:15.087
man. His problem, nobody's listening, was his 
wife. Now, I thought David Morgan was a fine fella

12:21.336 --> 12:29.908
and he was a good administrator.

12:32.268 --> 12:53.849
He attempted to do things, but once Tom Harrington 
named him president, Tom was chancellor, Tom

12:32.268 --> 12:53.849
would keep knocking him down and interfering and 
not letting him go on his own to do things. His

12:54.109 --> 12:57.172
problem was his wife. They were living in the old 
president's home. before it burned. And his wife

13:04.395 --> 13:24.067
would go over his head and over the head of the 
chancellor who was Tom Perry and go to the board

13:04.395 --> 13:24.067
members individually and complain about what was 
happening.

13:24.087 --> 13:27.553
And you can understand what a terrible problem 
that created. Now almost every board member in

13:28.158 --> 13:31.802
that era was a former student? I think so. Okay. And 
so was he terminated or did he resign? I think he was

13:36.868 --> 13:42.234
terminated because I had no actual fact on that. So 
Earl Rutter is brought here as executive vice

13:42.254 --> 13:47.741
president or? Vice president or executive vice 
president, I'm not sure of the title. As far as you

13:51.245 --> 13:55.550
know, was it pretty clearly understood that he was 
going to become the president? Yes. It was him, he

13:55.917 --> 14:00.723
and I talked about that group. And he said, I came to 
be president, they wouldn't give me the title. And

14:09.513 --> 14:12.177
he said, I am vice president. But he was placed in 
the office of Dave Martins and the co-governor.

14:19.225 --> 14:24.912
And he,

14:19.225 --> 14:24.912
I'm talking about early on. He would talk to me and 
said, well, they just don't do anything. In the

14:33.603 --> 14:42.777
meantime, while he was vice president, the bunch 
up at the chancellor's office were trying to pull

14:33.603 --> 14:42.777
everything away from me and him. He was in the 
chancellor's position. Sounds very familiar.

14:48.125 --> 14:50.729
And here was Tom Harrington. Here was E.L. Angel, 
Lionel Angel. Here was Henderson Shuffler. Here

14:55.435 --> 14:57.037
was Clyde Freeman. Here was John Calhoun. Just 
trying to pull it all away. Extension service and

15:02.203 --> 15:04.065
the whole thing. Just grabbing, grabbing, 
grabbing. All right. And you say that you chatted

15:08.610 --> 15:12.735
with Mr. Rutter a lot. Yeah. Did he ever give you any 
feeling that he worried about whether or not he

15:13.116 --> 15:21.185
could relate to the academics? Yes. The academic 
people. Yes, he did. He worried that he would not be

15:25.895 --> 15:32.483
accepted by the academic life on the campus. And he 
talked to me about that. And I said, Earl, if you'll

15:35.006 --> 15:53.910
be honest and forthright and try not to be 
something that you're not, use your main

15:35.006 --> 15:53.910
strengths and don't worry about your weaknesses, 
if they're weaknesses. I said, you're a good

15:54.380 --> 15:59.708
administrator.

16:00.549 --> 16:05.076
You know how to operate in legislative circles. 
You know how to operate with the big people of

16:06.898 --> 16:10.003
Texas. And I said, you do that. You do that. Because 
he was an old acquaintance of Johnson and Connolly

16:15.351 --> 16:21.800
and key legislators. Yes. Yes. And at that time, 
the University of Texas had very weak people,

16:23.776 --> 16:35.394
like Branson. And they did not know very well in 
Austin how to deal with the legislature. You'd

16:40.201 --> 16:41.903
know they were sitting right there with them. But 
Earl did. And they depended on Earl to help them

16:43.205 --> 16:49.134
with certain legislative problems. And Earl was 
very good at that. But Earl constantly worried

16:51.383 --> 16:55.649
about the fact that he had no advanced degrees. 
That he was not an educator. He wasn't a glib

17:00.795 --> 17:03.299
speaker. He was not a good speaker at all. And he 
knew that. And he knew that. He had no timetable.

17:11.710 --> 17:19.720
He'd get up to make speech and if somebody wouldn't 
tug on him or be in the back of the room and say this,

17:11.710 --> 17:19.720
he would talk for an hour and a half. And so he was not 
the speaker that, well, Dave Market, Tom

17:20.948 --> 17:36.241
Harrington, certainly Jack Wood, all 
outstanding speakers, Earl just didn't have that

17:20.948 --> 17:36.241
aspect of him. Where did the idea for what would 
later be called the Century Study, where did that

17:36.261 --> 17:42.787
originate? Let me explain to you. A lot of people

17:44.028 --> 17:49.673
are claiming credit You'll find this in your 
studies, or co-education, auction on post. A lot

17:57.663 --> 17:58.764
of people claim it's crazy. Let me tell you exactly 
the honest truth of what happened. In the early

18:05.892 --> 18:17.466
60s, our board, I'm talking about the association 
board, said we want to do a long-range study of

18:19.150 --> 18:27.640
where this association's going and where it needs 
to be in 25 or 30 years. So our board and our officers

18:27.660 --> 18:35.549
appointed what we call the Long Range Committee. 
And they met and they did a hell of a job. We talked to

18:39.733 --> 18:40.654
them. We developed the Distinguished 
Achievement Award Faculty Distinguished

18:47.450 --> 18:51.094
Achievement Awards was right there. That was 
developed in that study. Distinguished Alumni

18:55.918 --> 19:03.666
Awards developed right there in that study. The 
convocations, the computer, conversion to

19:03.686 --> 19:16.478
computer records, and the more we talked, the more 
we realized, We can't finish this job until we know

19:18.112 --> 19:24.281
where the university itself is going. Because our 
number one function is to help that university get

19:24.301 --> 19:30.529
where it wants to go. And right now, they don't know 
where they want to go. Nobody has put the light out

19:37.359 --> 19:41.584
there for them to guide them. So we did our study. 
And Mr. Harold Dunn, Tyree Bell, said, we have to

19:48.537 --> 19:58.671
have a meeting with the Board of Regents and the 
Board of Directors of Maine. We want Earl Rudder to

19:58.691 --> 20:02.116
be there. Well, Earl Rudder didn't want

20:02.136 --> 20:06.663
any of this stuff. He wasn't ready for that, was he? 
So I said, okay, what do you want us to do? Jimmy

20:13.383 --> 20:20.911
Astin was President of the Association, one of the 
strongest guys I ever met.

20:21.331 --> 20:25.976
I said, let's, and he said, we're going to have a 
meeting. This was Jimmy Astin. He said, we're

20:28.058 --> 20:34.384
going to have a meeting of the Board of Regents of 
A&M. We're going to meet in the Carousel Club. in

20:38.639 --> 20:40.501
the Sheridan Hotel in Dallas.

20:43.263 --> 20:44.664
And we were going to line it up. So we lined up a date 
and an evening. The Republic National Bank

20:48.487 --> 20:53.252
handled the cost of the meeting. And I remember 
Tyree and Harold Dunn and Jimmy Astin were our

20:53.272 --> 21:06.943
three representatives.

21:06.963 --> 21:07.684
Of course, I was there. Pearl was there. And those 
three men laid out the probe. And they said, we

21:16.968 --> 21:25.458
cannot finish our study until A&M has its own 
study. We want you to tell us where you want to go and

21:25.478 --> 21:31.526
what you want to do, what you want to accomplish. By 
1976, our 100th birthday.

21:39.119 --> 21:40.040
We talked about it. Earl didn't say much. But the 
board talked about it. They said, we think you're

21:45.104 --> 21:46.546
right. We think it ought to be done. And we'll get 
started. And we put up, I believe it was $75,000. It

21:59.377 --> 22:02.780
might have been $50,000 or $75,000 to finance 
this. A lot of money then. A lot of money. I attended

22:07.044 --> 22:08.485
another meeting. They agreed to do it. I attended 
another meeting with some of the members of the

22:11.142 --> 22:20.072
board up in the old boardroom, which was in Duncan 
Hall, upstairs there. And when we started talking

22:21.694 --> 22:38.573
about how we were going to set it up, who were going 
to be appointed, and so forth, we said, well, since

22:21.694 --> 22:38.573
we decided to call it the century stuff, and we 
decided to name about 100 because it was the

22:39.532 --> 22:46.640
century and because we were looking to be 100th 
birthday of the institution. 100 outstanding

22:48.021 --> 22:51.305
Texans. And we agreed not to confine it to any 
people. So we did, I don't remember what the

22:55.189 --> 23:05.801
breakup was, but it was somewhere around 50-50 or 
maybe 60-40, something like that. We had a lot of

23:05.821 --> 23:09.285
outstanding Texans, like Adam Shivers, and 
others on it that were not in and graduates from

23:10.700 --> 23:15.004
Houston, Texas. And it was this study, and this 
study alone, that prompted the appointment of the

23:16.966 --> 23:32.682
Aspirations Committee, which you hear Ray Bowen 
quoting from from time to time. It was not the

23:32.702 --> 23:35.364
Committee of Aspirations. It was a century report 
that prompted The Corps being named voluntary so

23:41.058 --> 23:52.150
that you could take your pick, go in the Corps or not 
go in the Corps. And name change.

23:57.016 --> 23:58.137
What about racial integration? Racial 
integration. And this other thing was seeking out

24:00.860 --> 24:11.031
outstanding faculty people.

24:11.230 --> 24:20.964
Were there any particularly strong advocates of 
these, of this idea of a century study? You

24:21.104 --> 24:41.153
mentioned Dunn and Aston and Tyree Bell and Polly 
Krueger and Louis Bloodworth were all very,

24:21.104 --> 24:41.153
George Morgan, Beaumont, our association was 
really strong for them. I mean to a man, they all

24:47.103 --> 24:49.986
wanted him. Now, there were some that were not 
happy with the outcome of it, but you know, we

24:50.006 --> 25:08.727
talked about that, Charlie Babcock, some of the 
other clubs, and the

24:50.006 --> 25:08.727
Smith, Mr. Travis Smith, But by and large, the 
association was strong for it. Earl was not real

25:14.159 --> 25:17.243
happy with it. I'll tell you what I think why he 
wasn't. When Earl came here, there was a lot to be

25:22.129 --> 25:26.795
done. And in fairness to Earl, he had his boat 
loaded.

25:32.683 --> 25:35.586
But he did need guidance. And of course, I guess 
he'd get guidance from everybody Whether he

25:38.845 --> 25:40.727
wanted it or not. Whether he wanted it or not. But

25:43.049 --> 26:07.671
Earl realized that some of the stud horses

25:43.049 --> 26:07.671
were on this other side and were talking 
co-education, were talking optional code, and

25:43.049 --> 26:07.671
were breaking some of these traditions that were 
hurting us. And once he saw that the real big boys

26:08.579 --> 26:19.671
were just insisting on it, he decided to go with it. 
But still, even during all the studies, he held

26:19.891 --> 26:24.596
back on name change. He didn't want the name 
change. He was afraid that the change of the name

26:27.579 --> 26:35.548
would cause A&M to lose some of its standing, 
whatever standing it had. All right, one day on

26:36.187 --> 26:49.904
that one, one day in 1970, about a month before he 
got sick, I was in his office and he knew that I had

26:36.187 --> 26:49.904
been the secretary who had drafted the 
aspirations report. He said, if you guys had

26:49.924 --> 26:54.590
recommended the name LSU has, it would have 
passed. And I said, what? And he said, the name over

26:56.232 --> 27:02.160
there is the Louisiana State University and 
Agricultural and Mechanical College. And he

27:02.478 --> 27:05.943
said, us old guys didn't want to lose the A&M. Yeah, 
yeah, yeah. Were there a number of others who felt

27:07.685 --> 27:10.028
that way? Not particularly. Oh, okay. Not 
particularly. Who was it? Somebody told me that,

27:14.314 --> 27:20.061
who came up with that name? I don't know what it was. 
Maggie McGee was big in those days. Yes, yes.

27:25.488 --> 27:29.734
Maggie McGee is more responsible for anybody else 
for this whole thing. higher education in Texas

27:30.254 --> 27:32.477
been? Do you remember when we used to go around the 
state in his airplane and make speeches? So Maggie

27:37.784 --> 27:40.508
was very involved in this century study. Somebody 
suggested at a meeting one time, not an A&M

27:40.548 --> 27:50.883
graduate, just name it Texas A&M University and be 
done with it. And that's what happened. All right,

27:53.206 --> 27:58.253
so there was a former student leadership 
recommended that there be a study of what A&M ought

27:58.553 --> 28:06.365
to be on its centennial. It was then called the 
Century Study. Then there were different parts of

28:09.549 --> 28:13.295
it. I ended up being on the Aspirations Committee. 
We were surprised when we voted as a committee on

28:18.663 --> 28:28.257
those special points that the vote was unanimous 
on every point. We thought, each of us thought we

28:28.760 --> 28:31.304
were the only one. We were not aware that the former 
student's leadership had a number of people who

28:32.105 --> 28:41.259
agreed. So that if somebody ever interviewed me 
about what was former student pressure on us,

28:41.740 --> 28:47.809
there was none. Okay, I've heard that the board of 
directors then as they were getting ready to

28:57.633 --> 29:06.265
consider, that they were hoping that the 
association leadership would endorse it. Share

29:07.326 --> 29:08.167
that with me. All right. I had left by then. That was 
in 64. Okay. And I left in the fall of 64, early in the

29:12.633 --> 29:19.923
fall of 64. And John Lindsay was president of the 
association. Buck Weiss had been named to take my

29:23.168 --> 29:26.492
place. And

29:27.400 --> 29:52.590
Earl had asked John if the association would pass a 
resolution in support of this committee, namely

29:27.400 --> 29:52.590
in support of everything that was done, including 
co-education and optional court. So they drafted

29:52.610 --> 29:56.935
the resolution, passed it, and adjourned the 
meeting. I've heard that that was the last item.

30:00.193 --> 30:01.435
Excuse me, I want to try to hear something. Sure. 
I'll be sure to answer that phone.

30:09.266 --> 30:09.827
All right. On the century study and so forth, the 
board of directors then, were you all aware of what

30:11.990 --> 30:22.225
their feelings were? Were they positive or 
negative about these changes or did you know? I

30:27.344 --> 30:29.707
don't think I knew. I don't think I knew. I know that 
when the thing was over and they were attempting to

30:32.390 --> 30:55.660
get the thing written and I know several drafts 
were prepared and I don't think there was a lot of

30:32.390 --> 30:55.660
approval of that draft and I think that's probably 
when you came into the picture. By that time, my

30:56.703 --> 31:19.177
main contact with the work of the Century Council 
was through

30:56.703 --> 31:19.177
Earl and through Wayne Hall and Dorsey. And

31:19.197 --> 31:25.647
we brought this guy, or they brought this guy,

31:28.900 --> 31:32.592
Bob Hunt, who was a farce.

31:35.923 --> 31:38.391
He was kind of the supposed executive director or 
something. He was the executive director of the

31:38.431 --> 31:40.598
century.
