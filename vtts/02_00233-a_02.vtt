WEBVTT

00:03.575 --> 00:14.649
No, no, you'll arrive... Before the telephone call, we were talking about which countries had been supporting the development.

00:17.833 --> 00:27.446
Well, of course, the biggest contributor to the International Agricultural Network was USAID, the U.S.

00:27.466 --> 00:29.488
government.

00:29.508 --> 00:30.730
That, I think, is...

00:32.110 --> 00:34.733
And in the beginning, it was absolutely necessary.

00:35.615 --> 00:41.522
They committed themselves to support one quarter of the budget of the system.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.525
But at that time, this was back in 1970.

00:45.207 --> 00:52.296
I think that the network, or the Consultative Group on International Agriculture, as it's called now.

00:52.316 --> 00:54.299
It has a small secretariat in the World Bank.

00:56.262 --> 01:00.447
And it has a technical advisory committee.

01:01.945 --> 01:30.366
They hold an annual meeting called Centers Weeks where all of the centers previously, they have submitted the budget proposal and the Secretariat looks at it and tries to keep the balance, reasonably good balance between the different institutes depending on the crops so that one doesn't get too much more of the pie, although there are differences in the importance

01:30.886 --> 01:34.571
food crops as it relates to the total number of people then.

01:34.891 --> 01:36.814
They try to keep it pretty well balanced.

01:37.855 --> 01:52.434
And then at this centers week, the director presents his program, a summary of what happened last year, what the plans are for the future, and the budget are there that are passed around.

01:53.295 --> 01:59.863
At this centers week, most of the donor country representatives are all of them.

02:00.299 --> 02:02.502
who have not become donors.

02:02.522 --> 02:10.652
And in addition, there are a certain number from the outside, but they try to keep it to a working group.

02:11.252 --> 02:17.180
It's not open to the general public because then it becomes unmanageable.

02:17.200 --> 02:28.213
But anyone can obtain permission to attend that's truly interested, donor or potential donor.

02:30.404 --> 02:34.950
Then they discuss these different programs openly.

02:36.732 --> 02:42.019
The directors and their staff have to defend their positions.

02:43.521 --> 02:47.606
Then the pledges are made for the forthcoming year.

02:48.688 --> 02:53.594
And if the global figure is inadequate, then there has to be adjustments in each budget.

02:54.936 --> 02:59.061
In addition to this global sum of money,

02:59.969 --> 03:04.073
There are special, which we call core funds.

03:06.195 --> 03:07.877
There are special project funds.

03:08.097 --> 03:17.086
If some government wants to do a special project, then that has to be funded on the outside by that particular agency.

03:19.288 --> 03:20.189
And there are some of those.

03:20.869 --> 03:29.858
And some of them give, well, monies for grants for training.

03:31.205 --> 03:34.029
But many of them identify the country.

03:34.710 --> 03:40.479
For example, NORAD is the Norwegian Foreign Technical Assistance.

03:40.499 --> 03:50.533
They specify which countries they will support students from at CIMIT or at ERI.

03:50.554 --> 03:59.727
I don't remember just which they are, but it's Bangladesh, Pakistan, Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique.

04:01.343 --> 04:04.567
Maybe one or two others, I don't recall.

04:04.587 --> 04:06.669
They can specify.

04:06.689 --> 04:16.060
And those funds are going to pay the cost of the training and travel fellowship for these hands-on control programs.

04:18.162 --> 04:27.553
Now, of course, this whole question of

04:29.137 --> 04:44.440
I remember in 1970, before this was established, when I came back from Stockholm, or from Oslo, there was a press conference in New York, and Dr. Robert Rockefeller Foundation, F.F.

04:44.460 --> 04:57.861
Hill, Vice President of Ford Foundation, John Hanna of the USAID at that time, were the main participants on the podium.

04:58.668 --> 05:06.756
Since they were the funding agency at that time, there were only three.

05:06.776 --> 05:12.362
And the government of Mexico in kind in Mexico.

05:12.382 --> 05:16.606
Those were four that were giving anything to Simmons.

05:16.986 --> 05:18.848
And that was throughout all of the 1970s then?

05:18.948 --> 05:19.249
No, no.

05:19.289 --> 05:25.755
This was just in 1970 when I came back.

05:27.727 --> 05:43.813
It was a pretty big press conference and all of the old veterans of the press, you know what some of them were like, they wanted to know how the hell this came about, the Nobel Prize for the so-called Green Revolution.

05:43.853 --> 05:45.275
What was its significance?

05:45.555 --> 05:48.460
What was the prize saying?

05:48.480 --> 05:51.625
And Herrera spoke first and John Hanna and

05:52.195 --> 05:53.797
And I was the last one up there.

05:53.817 --> 05:57.803
I was the one that got all of these nasty questions.

05:57.823 --> 06:01.969
I said, wow.

06:01.989 --> 06:07.677
I explained to him what the production had been in the period from 60 to 60.

06:07.697 --> 06:11.061
A little brief background on the Mexican thing, what happened there.

06:11.422 --> 06:18.592
But mostly because the focus was on the hunger and misery of that time in Pakistan and India.

06:19.974 --> 06:21.696
And what had happened and why had it happened.

06:23.397 --> 06:33.771
I remember one old veteran, I don't remember his name at the moment, but he said, how much is this boondoggle costing?

06:33.791 --> 06:34.592
That's what he called it?

06:34.833 --> 06:36.475
A boondoggle?

06:36.495 --> 06:37.536
Well, pretty much.

06:37.817 --> 06:39.339
I don't remember the exact word.

06:40.060 --> 06:43.304
Not a neutral word for a reporter.

06:43.324 --> 06:51.936
No, but I said, well, it costs about the total network.

06:52.557 --> 06:55.361
of which there were four in the beginning then.

06:55.381 --> 07:07.538
Erie and Simit were operating in Siyate, Tropical Center in Columbia, and Iita, the International Center of Tropics in Nigeria, were building.

07:07.558 --> 07:12.926
And I said, the total budget last year for those four was two Phantom Jet Fighters.

07:13.727 --> 07:17.793
And boy, right after that, you had them all in your hands.

07:19.455 --> 07:22.159
You could see the whole thing change.

07:24.468 --> 07:26.550
And what a perfect time to say it, too.

07:26.630 --> 07:32.277
Right while we're getting out of Vietnam and the American people are upset with the expenditure of the military.

07:32.717 --> 07:44.231
And then there were a lot of questions about details and how it come to be, but in an entirely different environment.

07:45.172 --> 07:50.678
I don't know how I pulled that one out, but it was very timely.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.906
Now let's talk a little bit about Americans.

07:55.926 --> 07:58.729
And so then these others came on the screen.

07:58.749 --> 08:10.182
And now the funding is very... There are somewhere around 39 countries that give funds to the system.

08:10.202 --> 08:19.032
And in addition to those, most of them are Western world, but they have to qualify because Japanese are big contributors.

08:20.554 --> 08:21.795
And more recently,

08:23.480 --> 08:30.889
Saudi Arabia has been giving us token amounts.

08:30.909 --> 08:47.470
The Shah, when he was still in Iran, he was the first to start giving funds.

08:47.490 --> 08:49.453
Of course, that all went down the drain when he went.

08:49.473 --> 08:51.675
India and Mexico have given token amounts to the system, quite apart from the in-kind, the land and stuff.

08:51.695 --> 08:52.997
There may be some others more recently, but especially those two.

08:53.872 --> 09:13.275
The World Bank and the United Nations Development Program put money into the system.

09:13.295 --> 09:17.660
FAO is involved, but since it's not a budgeting agency, it has to be funded from elsewhere, but it's a participant in the system.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.022
Unfortunately, it contributes a lot of the bureaucracies as well.

09:19.042 --> 09:21.465
Okay, now let's talk a little bit about

09:22.913 --> 09:23.414
funding.

09:24.034 --> 09:39.871
Recently in the news, there's been a lot of discussion about the United Nations, UNESCO, and the slant, the type of, well, their critics would say the type of propaganda that the American public was paying for before Reagan pulled us out of that.

09:40.932 --> 09:50.322
My question is, dealing with Simmons, when the United States to a USAID would give money

09:51.061 --> 09:54.625
Was there any political pressure?

09:54.665 --> 09:56.247
Did you perceive of any?

09:56.448 --> 09:57.689
Or any other countries?

09:57.709 --> 10:01.274
When other countries gave money, did you perceive of any political pressures?

10:01.494 --> 10:05.939
We never accepted money under political pressures.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.623
Were there offers under political pressures?

10:08.923 --> 10:12.547
Well, these things live and flow.

10:12.568 --> 10:18.655
For example, at the present time, with the surpluses that exist in the U.S.,

10:19.158 --> 10:23.808
of commodities, wheat, corn, soybeans.

10:23.828 --> 10:30.102
And the farmers under duress is when you get these pressures exerted.

10:30.122 --> 10:35.794
They don't come directly to us, but they come against USAID, who funds us.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.242
And I have a letter here right now.

10:39.458 --> 10:52.436
This happens to come from the Rockefeller Foundation, a new guy that's in handling their biotechnology because there's no agriculture program any longer in the Foundation.

10:52.456 --> 10:58.665
But I've worked one month a year for him doing special things.

10:59.270 --> 11:11.084
says, maybe I shouldn't next year put my effort down in Argentina since they're a food exporting country.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.105
In other words, he's been listening to this noise.

11:12.125 --> 11:22.257
And I was just about ready to dictate the answer today that from day one, when Dr. Herrera started this program, we were subjected to criticism in Mexico

11:22.490 --> 11:29.358
way back in the mid-40s, by traveling US senators and congressmen saying, what the hell are we doing?

11:29.378 --> 11:32.562
Destroying the US markets.

11:33.503 --> 11:39.189
And his answer and my answer today were the same.

11:39.209 --> 11:43.194
Beggars are poor customers.

11:43.214 --> 11:50.102
The hungry, poverty-stricken parts of the world are not good consumers, are not good customers.

11:50.122 --> 11:51.383
They have no money.

11:51.886 --> 11:58.808
And in those countries where 80 to 90% of the population is on the land in a subsistence agriculture,

11:59.227 --> 12:15.661
The only way that they can increase their purchasing power and alleviate part of their poverty and misery is by producing more agricultural produce to sell, to feed the urban population, which is the privilege sector of those societies.

12:16.282 --> 12:29.233
And hopefully, with that additional income, be able to buy some things as simple as a transistor, radio, and a bicycle, and a sewing machine eventually, some simple farm tools.

12:29.213 --> 12:30.937
Maybe something in from America.

12:31.478 --> 12:32.280
Exactly.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.768
This is the way it all starts moving.

12:35.788 --> 12:48.657
And one of my great frustrations is that as soon as, not just the US, but I think the US probably

12:49.143 --> 12:57.918
more so than the others, because they have never gone through a period of hunger like European countries did in World War II.

12:57.978 --> 13:04.128
There are still a few of the old veterans around that remember what the hell it was like when there was no food.

13:04.428 --> 13:05.370
The same in Japan.

13:06.131 --> 13:09.337
And so you don't get this in the same way, but the U.S.

13:10.218 --> 13:12.602
has never been hungry.

13:13.122 --> 13:16.366
Our Canadian natives, of course, have never been hungry.

13:16.386 --> 13:25.718
But I think that they are much less inclined to start talking about this when these surplus is built.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.522
But of course, they don't have any surplus.

13:28.542 --> 13:36.832
They've been able to sell everything they produce because of some internal policies that we have that I think are completely irrealistic.

13:37.113 --> 13:41.458
This high trigger price before grain can be released from government

13:41.962 --> 13:57.979
stockpiles for sale, either domestically or in international trade, was hopefully to provide a more stable and better income for our own domestic farmers.

13:57.999 --> 14:03.645
But it wasn't realistically related to international prices for those commodities.

14:04.326 --> 14:08.290
The result is that we've been building those huge surpluses.

14:08.270 --> 14:20.844
We're going to get to the whole issue of price supports and America farm crisis today and those issues, but I want to give us back on USAID.

14:20.864 --> 14:32.117
This is what has put pressures now on USAID and indirectly on some of the institutes like CIMAT.

14:33.076 --> 14:40.070
Maybe you shouldn't be working so much, especially in countries that suddenly have become food exporters.

14:40.531 --> 14:47.445
For example, China and India are now food exporters, wheat exporters.

14:47.465 --> 14:49.188
Argentina.

14:49.208 --> 14:50.190
Argentina has always been.

14:50.693 --> 15:05.654
And the reason I started working there is that I figured 25 years ago it was the only country that could be a major food exporter in Latin America to supply many of the other countries of Latin America when the time came.

15:06.295 --> 15:08.398
Well, you're fine.

15:08.458 --> 15:08.699
Go ahead.

15:09.880 --> 15:19.654
Well, I was simply going to say that now the big fight is on in a sort of war of...

15:19.803 --> 15:21.945
trade war between U.S.

15:22.166 --> 15:25.149
and agricultural produce and the European Common Market.

15:26.070 --> 15:27.652
But who gets squeezed?

15:27.692 --> 15:29.854
China and India.

15:29.874 --> 15:31.096
Now they've got surpluses.

15:31.937 --> 15:34.500
But they can't compete in the world market when the U.S.

15:34.520 --> 15:39.666
says, alright, we'll sell you at this price with credit for six months.

15:40.767 --> 15:44.811
India can't give credit for six months.

15:44.831 --> 15:45.933
You see?

15:45.953 --> 15:48.055
There's two sides to these issues.

15:48.710 --> 15:59.365
The fight between the European Common Market and the US is, there's a lot of gray there about who started what because we've been guilty also of this internal pricing.

15:59.945 --> 16:11.501
But they have subsidized their producers and so it ends up in a kind of a nasty trade war or the beginning of one.

16:11.521 --> 16:17.890
And the victims really are some that have finally scrambled up with

16:18.359 --> 16:25.470
fingernails and toenails to producing what they need plus a little more, hopefully, with which they could buy certain other things.

16:25.570 --> 16:43.979
For example, they could export wheat and rice, especially wheat, China and India, and buy more edible oil, soybean oil, these kinds of things that they don't produce in sufficient quantities.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.223
But it gets all gummed up.

16:47.485 --> 16:55.318
Unfortunately, many of our own, we can talk about that later, our own farmer groups don't understand.

16:55.399 --> 16:56.821
Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:56.841 --> 17:06.237
But now your friend at Rockefeller is going to say, I mean, just to play the devil's advocate, he'll say something while, you know, Argentina isn't starving.

17:06.419 --> 17:09.863
Why don't you go to Bangladesh and sell them?

17:09.883 --> 17:14.068
Is that the type of... We're in Bangladesh.

17:14.088 --> 17:21.416
And I say the surpluses of today are temporary.

17:23.378 --> 17:25.501
Can't say whether they're three years or five years.

17:26.141 --> 17:31.988
The People's Republic of China with that huge population pressure, and India too for that matter,

17:32.457 --> 17:38.664
Ten years down the road, it isn't going to be in the shape it's in right now, exporting rice and wheat.

17:41.126 --> 17:41.867
As I see it.

17:41.887 --> 17:45.311
There's no way of predicting.

17:45.331 --> 17:57.604
You can have all the computers and the best ones in the world and you're still operating on the hypotheses about how fast that internal consumption picture is going to change, how much more meat they're going to

17:58.310 --> 18:07.585
consume, which in turn will mean more grain use converted to heat production, feed for milk and eggs and meat and the whole gamut of things.

18:08.366 --> 18:24.992
But all the computers in the world, as we saw last Tuesday, don't prevent certain unpredictable and unexpected things from happening, like in the rocket.

18:26.288 --> 18:31.499
So we have hypotheses and we have lots of nice models that we check out.

18:32.441 --> 18:39.695
But a lot of this is pretty hazy because a lot of it has to do with the mental attitudes of people.

18:39.836 --> 18:40.657
Are they convinced?

18:42.982 --> 18:46.930
There's not a very good way of measuring these factors.

18:47.129 --> 18:51.481
Okay, let's go back to the 1970s and the focus here.

18:51.521 --> 18:55.812
We've got the rise of, to recapitulate, we have the rise of disease resistance.

18:55.893 --> 19:03.433
That's one of the main aims, the development of wheat nurseries on a worldwide basis and the growth of simmet.

19:03.532 --> 19:06.176
and a fraternity of wheat scientists.

19:06.196 --> 19:09.762
And the development of a world fraternity of wheat scientists.

19:10.323 --> 19:19.298
Are there any other major focuses of the 1970s and your life too?

19:20.339 --> 19:27.571
Yes, we began to also work on developing varieties that would fit adverse soil conditions, acid soils.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.995
Okay, let's start.

19:30.515 --> 19:34.261
with certain degree of aluminum tolerance, like in Brazil.

19:35.823 --> 19:43.856
In the shuttle breeding operation from Brazil to Mexico, supplemented with... I don't think you've described that.

19:43.876 --> 19:45.058
Well, let me say this.

19:45.238 --> 19:54.953
In both wheat and in rice, and for that matter, in any crops, there are a lot of soils that...

19:57.835 --> 20:09.710
are deficient in nutrients which you try to correct by supplying those nutrients in the form of chemical fertilizer or organic fertilizer.

20:09.730 --> 20:13.154
And of course the amount of organic fertilizer that's available is limited.

20:14.837 --> 20:27.032
But there are other soils where there are toxic levels of certain nutrients or of certain elements which restrict the growth or yield of the crop.

20:27.704 --> 20:32.669
For example, in Brazil, those soils are old.

20:32.789 --> 20:36.273
They've been highly leached over long geologic periods.

20:37.214 --> 20:40.677
The calcium has been removed and the magnesium.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.984
The result is that they're very acid.

20:48.325 --> 20:56.293
And when that happens, the phosphate that is in the soil is fixed on the iron compounds and unavailable to the plants.

20:57.235 --> 21:01.901
But the first problem is aluminum toxicity.

21:01.921 --> 21:08.709
And the ordinary wheats, arsenic wheats, just many of them would die when they were just emerging.

21:08.889 --> 21:14.096
A few of them would head and produce very miserable yields.

21:15.978 --> 21:27.192
On the other hand, a couple of old pioneer Brazilian wheat breeders, Piva was one of the first

21:27.847 --> 21:40.386
And Beckman, who was a Swede who went to Brazil right after he finished the University of Lund, spent his life there, passed away a few years ago.

21:40.406 --> 21:46.976
They selected out some types that would tolerate these very acid soils.

21:46.996 --> 21:49.460
But they were low in yield.

21:50.161 --> 21:56.250
Beckman especially had selected some types that had rather good disease resistance.

21:56.534 --> 22:01.522
especially against the rust, not against certain other diseases.

22:01.542 --> 22:24.398
And so about, I suppose eight or nine, ten years ago, we began collaborating with both the National Wheat Program in Brazil, of Imbrapa, as well as with two farmer groups that had their own research program.

22:27.635 --> 22:38.104
One at Cruz Alta in very acid soils where John Gibra, who had once been a member of our team, was working for these farmers' co-ops and one over in the state of Paranat.

22:39.145 --> 22:56.680
And we crossed those best old Brazilian varieties that were tolerant to the soil condition, aluminum tolerance, with a number of our best Mexican weeds

22:56.896 --> 23:01.821
did very poorly there, but had high yield potential.

23:01.841 --> 23:13.392
Then we selected the first segregating generation under Mexican conditions, heavy disease epidemics in Sonora, and I personally selected those.

23:13.412 --> 23:22.161
The best plants in quite a few of these, I spent, I guess, a week at this, picking all the best plants.

23:22.850 --> 23:41.905
from the standpoint of how they tailored and their agronomic types whether the farmers would accept them selected thrashed them selected the grain of the best ones and then we divided the grains from each plant into four groups four different envelopes one went to

23:43.437 --> 24:00.131
Paso Fundo, where the Imprapa headquarters were in Brazil, one to Cruz Alta, which is very acid soil for Gibraltar was, and another group to Paraná, also a farmer's co-op, where they had different, they had acid soil also.

24:00.151 --> 24:13.022
And we planted the fourth envelope in our high valleys in Toluca, which is pretty much neutral soil, but where it rains heavily every day during the summer season.

24:14.251 --> 24:27.529
We had it worked out so that the three Brazilian research stations would telex us which rows were homozygous, uniformly resistant or tolerant to the aluminum.

24:27.549 --> 24:28.430
They were growing normally.

24:29.972 --> 24:35.319
And in Toluca where we couldn't see this, we had the duplicate rows, the same rows.

24:36.781 --> 24:43.110
We would forget about all of those rows that were segregating where you had both kind or that were susceptible.

24:43.512 --> 24:55.666
And we would only select for disease resistance and good plant type in those rows that were homozygous resistant based on the telex information from the three places in Brazil.

24:57.428 --> 25:05.638
And we would harvest the seed of those best plants, take them to Sonora, which is alkaline soil plant in October.

25:06.142 --> 25:19.846
Meanwhile, from those three locations in Brazil, they would select the best plants that they saw, not only in the ones that were tolerant, but in rows that were segregating, both were tolerant and susceptible, all the good plants.

25:20.868 --> 25:27.320
They would send part of that seed to us in Sonora and plant it there, in Ayaka and so on.

25:27.340 --> 25:30.225
Meanwhile, we developed a little technique to speed this up.

25:31.488 --> 25:46.211
Right in Mexico, in Eva Viegas' biochemical laboratory, we got set up so that the new cross, you make the cross and you grow the plant.

25:46.231 --> 25:52.641
And the first generation, those seedlings will be intermediate between the two parents.

25:52.661 --> 25:59.031
But you harvest the seed of these intermediate, or this first generation from the cross.

25:59.517 --> 26:02.621
The next time you plant them, they're all different.

26:02.641 --> 26:06.166
So we would take the seed of the second generation.

26:06.206 --> 26:14.598
We would germinate them on screens in a nutrient solution in the laboratory.

26:14.618 --> 26:23.770
And when the roots were about so long, we would wash them off and then lift the whole tray and put the roots.

26:24.391 --> 26:33.465
In a buffered solution of aluminum at about, I think originally we used 45 parts per million.

26:33.485 --> 26:37.211
Leave it there 18 hours, wash off the roots.

26:37.231 --> 26:42.519
And then we would stain at the roots with hematoxylen.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.863
The dead tissues turned brown.

26:46.649 --> 26:51.575
And the ones that have not been damaged stay white.

26:51.595 --> 26:55.140
We wash this out, put them back in the nutrient solution.

26:55.160 --> 27:01.447
And after three days, we would leave those that were regrowing at the point.

27:01.467 --> 27:07.455
And those were tolerant, and we would transplant those pots in the greenhouse from those.

27:08.336 --> 27:10.479
We didn't have to go back to Brazil every time.

27:10.499 --> 27:14.023
In other words, we could plant those after we got the seed from those.

27:14.729 --> 27:26.862
in Toluca or in Sonora, and feel pretty sure that we, most of them would be tolerant to aluminum under Argentine, Brazilian condition.

27:26.882 --> 27:30.606
Of course, meanwhile, we kept moving, shuttling their material back and forth.

27:30.786 --> 27:44.601
The result is that today, the commercial varieties in Brazil, new ones that came from this technique, are probably yielding nearly

27:47.011 --> 27:52.238
80% more than the whole variety by the combination... Increase to 80%?

27:52.618 --> 27:53.279
Almost doubled?

27:55.062 --> 27:56.183
When they're properly grown.

27:56.303 --> 27:56.884
Exactly.

27:57.505 --> 27:58.486
Under ideal conditions.

27:58.526 --> 27:59.527
Under ideal conditions.

28:00.068 --> 28:07.698
It's still low yield compared to Mexican conditions, but a big step forward.

28:07.718 --> 28:09.621
And that's in the first cycle.

28:09.641 --> 28:10.722
We think this can be done.

28:10.963 --> 28:14.387
In rice, they're finding the same sort of thing.

28:14.788 --> 28:16.630
Now you could correct this.

28:17.521 --> 28:24.330
But you would have to put on four to five tons of lime per acre.

28:25.972 --> 28:30.638
Because they're that acid and it's poorly buffered.

28:30.658 --> 28:33.221
And it's simpler to go this way.

28:33.942 --> 28:38.608
Now that doesn't mean that there won't be some liming going on.

28:38.628 --> 28:47.359
Because in the case of the soybeans, they've already started to lime some of those soils because the soybeans will produce nearly double with lime.

28:48.284 --> 28:50.066
The lime does two things.

28:50.086 --> 28:55.393
Those soils are highly leached of calcium so that they're actually short of calcium as an essential nutrient.

28:56.274 --> 29:02.503
And magnesium, which is part of the molecule of the chlorophyll.

29:02.523 --> 29:07.029
And in dolomitic limestone you have both calcium and magnesium.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.651
So you supply these.

29:09.292 --> 29:14.258
But the lime also changes the pH so that you've got

29:14.963 --> 29:16.225
Three possible effects.

29:16.645 --> 29:28.200
Generally when we lime our Midwestern soils to correct acidity, there's enough calcium present in those so that from and magnesium under most of them.

29:28.220 --> 29:29.081
That's not limiting.

29:29.381 --> 29:33.486
The acid condition is what you're liming for.

29:33.506 --> 29:37.812
But in some of those extreme cases like down there, you've got both.

29:38.993 --> 29:42.658
Deficiency of calcium and magnesium as a nutrient plus

29:42.925 --> 30:12.780
need to change the pH so this is a new thing that's happening now in the case of rice especially we well we find minor nutrients deficiencies also zinc for example we begin to see this in India fairly early I'm sure that we can find different genetic differences

30:13.098 --> 30:25.396
But I don't think it's necessary because a few ounces of zinc sulfate, a fraction of a pound mixed with the other fertilizer takes care of it.

30:25.416 --> 30:28.781
It's probably easier to handle it that way.

30:28.801 --> 30:33.448
But when it comes to these toxic substances, it may be different.

30:34.349 --> 30:42.902
Or as time goes on, you may say, all right, I guess we need to select out types that are resistant or that

30:43.203 --> 30:49.351
have the ability to extract zinc when it's limiting for the ordinary varieties.

30:49.371 --> 30:51.094
It could be copper.

30:51.134 --> 31:03.951
There are soils which are deficient in zinc and copper to a point where you have to put it on, especially on grasses and in rice, or your yields are greatly suppressed.

31:04.472 --> 31:12.923
When you get into those minor, or into those deficiencies of minor nutrients, if you develop a variety,

31:13.443 --> 31:23.296
that has this ability to extract enough so that it yields well when the other varieties do not.

31:23.316 --> 31:36.513
It will take you several years to find out whether this is a one or two or three shot deal, that they're able to extract it, but that they too will reach a point where they cannot extract it.

31:36.533 --> 31:41.239
In other words, it will depend on how fast

31:41.759 --> 31:49.969
the basic raw material of the soil is liberating additional zinc or copper.

31:50.429 --> 32:08.210
And whether it is fast enough, even with the higher yields that the variety that has the ability to extract this nutrient when others do not, will deplete it to a level where again you've got the same situation.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.112
If that's the case, then you need to add these.

32:10.430 --> 32:17.260
But most of these minor nutrients, they're small quantities and they're not expensive.

32:18.962 --> 32:25.151
Now has the Brazilian experiments, the soil experiments been used in other areas internationally?

32:25.652 --> 32:27.635
Or have they had an upshot on other areas?

32:28.235 --> 32:29.978
Paraguay is using them.

32:29.998 --> 32:37.028
As a matter of fact, empirically, in Paraguay we could see this

32:37.936 --> 32:41.701
before we were entirely clear of it in Brazil.

32:41.942 --> 32:44.726
So there you could use it.

32:44.746 --> 32:56.803
And I'm sure that there's some other parts of the world where, for example, even though we don't work there, Zimbabwe has these kinds of soils.

32:56.823 --> 32:59.527
And some of the Mexican weeds moved in there.

32:59.747 --> 33:02.231
We never had staff there, but they moved in.

33:02.251 --> 33:05.175
South Africa has these kinds of soils.

33:06.893 --> 33:07.534
grown there.

33:07.594 --> 33:13.621
They went to the university and many of these things became commercial variety.

33:14.442 --> 33:35.668
Both Zimbabwe and this was before it became Zimbabwe but about the same time when we started working in India and Pakistan, small samples through requests from a professor went to

33:36.070 --> 33:47.224
Southern Rhodesia then, now Zimbabwe, and another to a professor at the University of South Africa.

33:47.345 --> 33:48.807
These became a commercial bride.

33:51.350 --> 33:55.956
So there's no international borders on these kinds of things.

33:56.436 --> 34:00.001
Political ideologies have nothing to do with it either.

34:00.041 --> 34:01.002
They transcend this.

34:01.503 --> 34:02.364
What works.

34:03.005 --> 34:04.307
What works.

34:04.327 --> 34:05.368
And in the same way,

34:05.686 --> 34:06.968
many of these things.

34:07.889 --> 34:25.051
The first Mexican wheat, early, probably in 66 spring, went to China by way of the Minister of Agriculture of Pakistan because they had good contacts with China.

34:25.071 --> 34:31.980
And then in 1974 when I asked some of the wheat scientists in western China, I said,

34:32.720 --> 34:40.568
were and what were the first wheats that you saw with the type of dwarfing genes you're working with now.

34:40.588 --> 34:45.773
You said they were your wheats that came to us from Pakistan.

34:45.793 --> 34:49.877
And we also saw some of them in winter types that came from Korea.

34:52.079 --> 34:52.459
Those were the two.

34:52.479 --> 34:56.323
But this was long before there was any relations between the U.S.

34:56.343 --> 35:02.389
and China or Mexico and China.

35:03.517 --> 35:06.341
And so these things are interesting.

35:06.882 --> 35:15.256
Science and technology isn't necessarily bound in by political ideology.

35:16.638 --> 35:29.839
Many of them moved into and were used probably commercially, but we still don't have a good picture of that in South Russia also from India.

35:29.859 --> 35:31.161
That's interesting too.

35:31.934 --> 35:34.076
Why did you retire from the Senate in 1982?

35:34.096 --> 35:41.423
79 the first time before then Glenn took over.

35:41.443 --> 35:43.365
Glenn Anderson.

35:43.385 --> 35:43.485
Yeah.

35:43.505 --> 35:47.809
And then when he died I was an acting director again.

35:47.829 --> 35:48.210
Until 82?

35:49.331 --> 35:49.431
Yeah.

35:49.451 --> 35:59.140
The reason I retired, this is a regulation of 65 of the Senate.

36:00.571 --> 36:03.876
Not only Simmons, the network.

36:03.896 --> 36:12.588
So you reach mandatory retirement age.

36:12.608 --> 36:12.728
Right.

36:12.748 --> 36:14.150
What were your thoughts when you retired?

36:16.053 --> 36:17.114
Well, I wasn't very happy.

36:17.415 --> 36:19.077
I don't retire very well.

36:19.097 --> 36:23.303
No.

36:23.423 --> 36:28.410
For that reason, I still keep working.

36:28.430 --> 36:29.532
It's more difficult than

36:29.798 --> 36:31.900
than ever because now I got more bosses.

36:32.641 --> 36:33.782
Before I used to have one.

36:35.143 --> 36:46.533
Now I get split up here part of the year, consultant for CIMIT part of the year, foundation a short time, visiting professor at Cornell a short time, and that's pretty hectic.

36:46.553 --> 36:48.735
It's worse than before.

36:49.436 --> 36:59.805
Because you, then you get many obligations that, for example, right here now, I didn't know this,

37:00.359 --> 37:03.324
organization this morning.

37:03.925 --> 37:11.698
You probably know it.

37:11.718 --> 37:16.085
Here at Zalado, the Institute for the Humanities at Zalado.

37:16.385 --> 37:17.507
Are you familiar with this?

37:18.910 --> 37:21.574
Well, this is... Oh, out in West Texas.

37:22.330 --> 37:25.036
Well, it's up here towards Temple, isn't it?

37:25.056 --> 37:25.918
It's over here in Central.

37:25.999 --> 37:26.580
Oh, yeah, okay.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.442
Yeah, I've heard of this.

37:27.582 --> 37:29.687
Yeah.

37:29.707 --> 37:35.461
It turns out that Wilmer was the creative head of this.

37:35.481 --> 37:38.047
He established it.

37:38.067 --> 37:40.693
It's a kind of an intellectual institute.

37:42.040 --> 37:46.585
They bring in a group of speakers on social issues of all kinds.

37:47.305 --> 37:58.477
About three years ago, they had a big conference there with about a half a dozen speakers, and they eventually, Texas A&M Press published the book, and it was all dealing with the Vietnam War.

37:59.618 --> 38:03.442
I didn't know that, but anyway, this guy, I don't remember.

38:04.242 --> 38:05.263
He was at Minnesota.

38:05.284 --> 38:11.710
He graduated a year after I did, and he took all his degrees there.

38:13.006 --> 38:18.152
originally in liberal arts and then in medicine.

38:18.172 --> 38:29.726
And then he was a fellow down at the Mayo Clinic for about six years before he came down here to, at the University of San Antonio and their medical staff.

38:30.607 --> 38:41.460
And he too is retired now, he works part-time with them and he created this thing, I think he said seven or eight years ago, to kind of attempt to be a bridge to the

38:42.335 --> 38:58.761
between the scientific professional people and the laymen, both young and elderly, on world issues.

38:58.781 --> 39:03.388
I just thought this was in West Texas.

39:03.769 --> 39:05.271
It's by Temple.

39:15.983 --> 39:19.930
And I get tangled into a lot of these things.

39:20.030 --> 39:33.173
I have to watch myself and I don't do it very well to restrict the things that I accept so that I don't get so damn frustrated that I never get anything done the way I want it.

39:33.193 --> 39:35.798
Yeah, yeah.

39:36.082 --> 39:44.978
I think we ought to stop right here and I think we ought to talk about world issues next time and the whole issue of American farm policy.

39:46.241 --> 39:52.572
We've talked about five major themes during the 1970s and if you can think of any more.

39:52.552 --> 39:55.196
Then we'll go into that next time, too.

39:56.158 --> 39:58.141
But next Friday, I'd like to talk to you.

39:58.181 --> 39:59.043
Can I make a note there?

39:59.183 --> 39:59.984
Triticales.

40:00.004 --> 40:01.347
That's a new crop.

40:01.367 --> 40:02.889
I don't guess we talked about this.

40:02.909 --> 40:04.432
We're trying to bring this thing.

40:04.452 --> 40:07.877
How do you spell it?

40:07.897 --> 40:08.418
T-R-I-T-I-C-A-L-E-S.

40:09.700 --> 40:14.268
I got interested in this way back in... And how do you pronounce it?

40:14.328 --> 40:15.310
Triticales.

40:15.650 --> 40:16.652
Triticales.

40:16.953 --> 40:19.275
Pretty chaotic.

40:19.295 --> 40:19.415
Okay.

40:19.535 --> 40:22.378
Do you want to talk about, is that another aspect about the 70s?

40:23.378 --> 40:24.399
I mean, would you like to talk?

40:24.419 --> 40:26.401
That's one of the major things.

40:26.441 --> 40:30.064
Well, do you want to address that now, or would you rather wait till next Friday?

40:30.084 --> 40:31.105
Maybe wait till the next time.

40:31.125 --> 40:32.706
Okay, then we'll start off on that.

40:33.307 --> 40:46.858
And then I want to talk to you about, well, we've got all kinds of issues that I've been thinking about with this credible farm problem that we've got in America, and all the different types of programs that have attempted to solve it,

40:47.632 --> 40:57.862
I'd like to know about other things, world food shortages, Africa, genetic manipulation, things like that that are being used in animals today.

40:59.025 --> 41:01.472
So there's all kinds of things that we'll talk about next time.
