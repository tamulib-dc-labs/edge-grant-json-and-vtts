WEBVTT

00:03.507 --> 00:06.991
Because I have to be at a meeting at 3, so I've got to 
leave at about 1 in Austin. Oh, oh, oh. Then we will

00:09.935 --> 00:17.404
have to go until 1.

00:17.924 --> 00:21.869
When your freshman year, when you were going to go 
home, how did you get back and forth? How did you

00:21.909 --> 00:22.510
travel? Hitchhike. Describe Aggie hitchhiking. 
Uniform and a maroon and white bag that said TAM on

00:27.676 --> 00:31.641
it and Just as good as having a car. And where did you 
catch your ride from College Station? Where did

00:38.373 --> 00:38.854
you? Out here on 21. I'd go to Somerville and then 
back through La Grange and then get on 77. Or I'd go

00:47.945 --> 00:51.950
to 21 all the way to 77 up there and get back. I never 
had. I could get home hitchhiking almost the exact

00:53.072 --> 01:00.902
same time that I could get home with a car. Did you 
ever have any negative experience hitchhiking?

01:05.774 --> 01:05.914
Uh-uh. Well, I had one guy. I had one guy who was an 
older Hispanic guy, and he had just bought a purple

01:08.077 --> 01:17.288
Pontiac Catalina. And I was going to A&I to see my 
girlfriend at the time, and he picked me up in

01:18.510 --> 01:25.739
LaGrange. He said, you're in the Army? I said, no, 
I'm in A&M. He said, well, where are you going? And I

01:32.067 --> 01:36.875
said, well, as far as you'll go, but I need to go all 
the way to Kingsville. He said, well, I'll go to

01:37.857 --> 01:39.359
Kingsville. I just bought this car, and I got a case 
of Jack's beer in the back, and why don't we just go

01:39.399 --> 01:45.129
to Kingsville? And I said, golly, if that's okay 
with you. We were using up most of two lanes getting

01:47.973 --> 01:51.079
down there. We got there, and he got to Kingsville. 
He was a great guy. Got to Kingsville, turned

01:54.825 --> 01:57.990
around, and going back to Giddings. Now, did the 
hitchhiking routine continue throughout your

01:58.882 --> 02:05.208
four years for students in general? Yeah. Well, I 
finally got my senior year, I got my sister's car

02:07.150 --> 02:16.318
that was new when she went to UT, so it was five years 
old when I got it. But it was still, hitchhiking was

02:16.338 --> 02:20.302
still going on. Oh, yeah. You bet. The...

02:27.333 --> 02:34.220
On this all-male campus, how did you and your 
buddies get dates, or almost all-male? Oh, we

02:35.061 --> 02:38.164
usually didn't. Well,

02:38.924 --> 02:52.598
we were a little bit lucky in that one of the guys in 
our outfit couldn't handle all this stuff, and he

02:38.924 --> 02:52.598
went to Stephen F. Austin. and became a disc jockey 
in Stephen F. Austin, somewhat of a celebrity. And

02:57.261 --> 03:03.710
so he would call us on a pretty regular basis and 
have us come up to Nacogdoches and visit with him.

03:03.750 --> 03:12.363
And then I

03:03.750 --> 03:12.363
had friends at the University of Texas, TU, so we'd 
go there and get dates there. But my first couple of

03:12.383 --> 03:18.552
years, I was dating this girl from A&I, and so she 
would always come up and I'd always Always go down

03:18.869 --> 03:24.434
there, but... Where did a date like that stay when 
she was here? Where did she spend the night? In a

03:27.456 --> 03:28.077
hotel. Okay. Because no longer was it normal for 
them to spend the night with a faculty... Yeah, no.

03:35.303 --> 03:35.904
That was gone. It was just hotel room. One of these 
hotels around here, they were... Were the tests

03:39.887 --> 03:42.269
still coming down in large numbers?

03:45.532 --> 03:47.914
I guess about my freshman year, and it kind of 
started... When I was a senior,

03:48.485 --> 04:01.824
when I was a junior, the Aggie sweetheart, or 
whatever you call it, was still from TWU. When I was

04:03.005 --> 04:12.018
a senior, we changed that in student government 
and made it local. Describe how that change came

04:12.378 --> 04:13.941
about. That's an important point. Well, 
actually, I did it, we did it through student

04:18.218 --> 04:22.465
government. We just decided it was time and so when 
my senior year in student government, we passed

04:22.505 --> 04:27.753
the deal. I remember going to TWU and just saying, 
you know, we're getting so big now and it's

04:27.893 --> 04:39.110
becoming offensive to ladies here and stuff like 
that and we're going to do it there. And so we just

04:39.511 --> 04:46.622
did and I put a guy named David Moore in charge of, 
you know, deal. He's a stockbroker now in Tyler.

04:50.424 --> 04:57.034
And I'm sure it was quite coincidental that the 
girl that became the first Aggie sweetheart from

04:50.424 --> 04:57.034
here is now his wife.

05:00.519 --> 05:02.723
And his daughter is a student here now. How did the 
women at TWU respond, react to the decision? I

05:07.290 --> 05:08.011
think okay. I think some of them were not too happy, 
but it wasn't a bad visit. I remember going up there

05:14.140 --> 05:15.242
and explaining to them that we were going to do 
this. And the student senate at the time of that

05:18.239 --> 05:23.106
decision was entirely all male? No. There were 
some women in there? Was there much disagreement

05:26.331 --> 05:29.997
with the decision? Almost none. It was just time. 
Let's talk about campus administrative

05:35.065 --> 05:38.530
leadership. Describe Earl Rudder as you and your 
buddies saw him. Well, see, he died, I think, when I

05:43.513 --> 05:48.339
was maybe the end of my freshman year. You came in 
fall of 68? When did he die? Early 70. Early 70? So at

05:53.886 --> 05:56.769
the end of my sophomore year, something like that. 
Well, I only got to see him one time because I was, I

05:57.831 --> 06:06.762
mean, I was sophomore class president and class 
presidents didn't, get in that realm. I knew Jack

06:09.225 --> 06:11.028
Williams obviously a lot better. Earl Rudder was 
viewed as a god. He really was. All you heard was

06:18.838 --> 06:25.847
stories about Omaha and Earl Rudder. He was 
generally viewed as the guy that saved A&M, but the

06:28.090 --> 06:33.897
core If he was viewed as a guy that diversified A&M, 
he was also, because of his war record, the Corps

06:35.294 --> 06:43.104
just revered him. Nobody I knew ever met the man, 
but he was just like a god to all. Did you all think

06:48.450 --> 06:55.799
that anybody could argue with him or protest?

06:55.899 --> 06:56.540
No. We didn't do protests. I remember during that 
time there were a lot of protests on campuses. When

07:02.885 --> 07:11.293
Jack Williams first came in, his first day, first 
night here, there was about 10 of us. It was a corps

07:11.373 --> 07:16.518
commander, a committee of about five people and 
students in it. I was one of them. Kent was one of

07:17.799 --> 07:20.481
them and several others. And we must have put 2,000 
people in his front yard. I'm sure he looked out

07:24.805 --> 07:29.770
there and thought, oh, my God, here I am right in the 
middle of, you know, a student protest and it was

07:30.290 --> 07:35.556
just us welcoming him to A&M. I remember the media 
were pretty shocked that you'd have a student

07:35.676 --> 07:42.664
demonstration welcoming a new president to A&M. 
What did describe Jack Williams as you and other

07:42.884 --> 07:47.689
students understood him? Real smart. Real smart 
guy. I mean, he was a real no nonsense guy. Didn't

07:56.920 --> 07:58.221
take very long. I remember we were setting up 
something... What's that professor's name? He's

08:04.687 --> 08:09.773
like a physical... Wehmeyer...

08:11.996 --> 08:16.121
He was vice president for academic affairs during 
Williams' time. Oh, Dick Winerdi. Winerdi, yeah.

08:20.125 --> 08:26.453
Anyway, we had decided we wanted something called 
a disciplinary appeals where you couldn't just

08:26.922 --> 08:29.224
kick a kid out of school. You had to at least have 
somebody review it and stuff like that, and we'd

08:29.244 --> 08:34.308
worked all this stuff out with Winerdi. And I 
remember the meeting with Williams lasted about

08:36.030 --> 08:40.534
4.2 minutes. He said, fine, did it, done. He didn't 
tarry around too long with his decisions. He knew

08:47.540 --> 08:48.581
what he wanted to do. What about him as a public 
speaker? Well, I thought he was good. I saw him at

08:52.404 --> 08:54.126
a... I went with him. particularly my senior year, 
travel with him to listen to a lot of his speeches

08:55.745 --> 09:06.100
and sometimes the two of us to do one from the 
student perspective and stuff like that. I

09:06.120 --> 09:07.602
thought he was a great public speaker. Describe 
from that year when you were student body

09:07.622 --> 09:12.229
president, describe some of those trips. Well, we 
would go to, I remember one time we went to, it was

09:13.130 --> 09:20.261
like a Rotary Club or a Lions Club or somewhere. I 
think it was in Texarkana. I'm not real sure. But I

09:23.746 --> 09:25.448
remember the guy gets up I had already said a little 
blurb about A&M and the guy gets up and introduces

09:26.120 --> 09:35.112
Dr. Williams with an Aggie joke. And Williams, I 
mean the guy, by the time Williams finished within

09:36.374 --> 09:44.785
the first five minutes, the guy I'm sure just got on 
his all fours and crawled out. It was just, you

09:44.845 --> 09:46.748
know, terrible. That didn't happen anymore. That 
got around pretty good. But what Williams could do

09:50.613 --> 09:53.477
is, For those, he's so cerebral, for those people 
that, you know, mistakenly thought A&M was a bunch

09:54.757 --> 10:11.610
of clodbusters and stuff like that, all of a sudden 
you listen to that guy's speeches, boy, that's a

09:54.757 --> 10:11.610
whole new image of what they were used to. So I think 
one of the things he added a lot to was, He made us

10:15.698 --> 10:20.386
this national presence academically. Did an 
awful lot for that. Did you ever go with him to

10:22.550 --> 10:25.174
anything political? Like political fundraisers 
and stuff like that? Or to Austin to a hearing or

10:29.041 --> 10:31.966
anything like that? Oh, one time. Yeah, just a 
little show-off deal where they took some

10:33.128 --> 10:40.120
students with them before Senate Finance 
Committee and wanted to have plenty of short hair.

10:40.808 --> 10:44.652
haircuts and stuff like that, so I went to a few, 
maybe one or two of those. How skillful was he with

10:44.672 --> 10:47.075
the real world politicians? The what? How 
skillful was he with politicians? Oh, he was good.

10:52.361 --> 10:52.922
He was good. He was really good at all of it. He 
didn't, I mean, Heatley never liked him, and that

10:54.724 --> 10:59.009
wasn't going to change. I don't know what caused 
that, but once you cross Heatley, it doesn't ever

10:59.069 --> 11:03.554
change. I know Heatley real well, and if Heatley 
buries the hatchet, he always remembers where he

11:03.634 --> 11:10.562
buried the hatchet. He was like that. But, no, he 
was good. I think the appropriations during that

11:15.131 --> 11:22.461
period of time were some of their better clips. Of 
course, it didn't hurt at that time to have, you

11:22.481 --> 11:30.431
know, the chairman of the State Affairs Committee 
in the Senate, a member of the Budget Board. Bill

11:31.032 --> 11:34.416
Preston was chairman of the House Appropriations 
Committee. Bill Clayton was Speaker of the House

11:35.017 --> 11:37.340
of Representatives. I mean, that don't hurt too 
bad. Yeah, yeah. And let's see, Conley had

11:41.440 --> 11:49.674
finished his, who was the governor at that point? 
Briscoe. Briscoe, Briscoe. And he had Reagan

11:52.238 --> 12:01.194
Brown there doing all of the A&M stuff. Back to 
campus student life. Here's one that I haven't

12:04.239 --> 12:06.182
asked many people. Do junior buddies know about 
any steam tunnels? Sure. Describe steam tunnels

12:10.232 --> 12:14.617
and what went on in steam tunnels. We didn't do it 
for any illicit purposes. There were some rumors

12:17.780 --> 12:27.511
that people would use them to try to get into you 
guys' offices where you had tests and stuff like

12:17.780 --> 12:27.511
that, but we thought that was more easily done by 
simply scaling the walls. No, we would just go in

12:27.551 --> 12:35.359
them, not as freshmen and sophomores because they 
never would let us out for stuff like that, but

12:36.132 --> 12:45.765
Yeah, on weekends when there was nothing to do, no 
football season going on, we'd go into the Stephen

12:36.132 --> 12:45.765
Tunnels and just wander and see where we came out. 
Where did you normally enter, though? Over by the

12:49.751 --> 12:51.553
academic building. Okay, and you could go how far? 
To the other end of campus, best I could tell. To

12:56.500 --> 12:59.564
engineering, to Zachary? Oh, see, that was just 
being built down there. I remember when I was a...

13:05.393 --> 13:09.577
When I was a senior is when they dedicated to 
Zacherville, and I remember that dedication.

13:09.637 --> 13:10.959
Could you go to the MSC? Yeah, right up to it. Yeah. 
Yeah, I think you could kind of go pretty much

13:14.762 --> 13:17.845
everywhere. I mean, I'm sure there's skeletons 
down there somewhere where somebody never got

13:18.106 --> 13:23.851
out. And you used flashlights? Uh-huh. Because 
there's no lights in the tunnel. No. And about how,

13:29.037 --> 13:31.519
what are the dimensions of the tunnels? Oh, well, 
you can, you can, you know, stand up straight, but

13:31.583 --> 13:38.355
you've got to kind of hunch over a little bit to get 
through. And there's a bunch of wires and pipes in

13:38.375 --> 13:40.218
it. How wide? Oh, as wide as that door, maybe, maybe 
a little less. And were there any unwritten rules

13:45.848 --> 13:50.236
about who was not to be in the tunnels? Nah, we just 
lifted up the grate. Was it by and large, though,

13:53.502 --> 13:56.427
core primarily? Well, every time I went in, I'm 
sure there were other kids that did the same thing,

13:56.947 --> 14:08.140
but we would go in and just kind of see how lost we 
could get and see where we came up. And there'd be a

14:08.581 --> 14:13.206
fork in the deal and one group would go one place and 
we'd find out where we were. Now, when you were

14:13.807 --> 14:19.874
student body president your senior year, would 
that have been acceptable for you to be in the steam

14:13.807 --> 14:19.874
tunnel? Nah, that wouldn't have been very good. 
Okay, so. It wouldn't have been very good. Do you

14:25.516 --> 14:34.594
have any information or

14:25.516 --> 14:34.594
rumors about secret fraternities that you can 
share with this machine? No. I always heard those

14:35.817 --> 14:40.426
rumors, little snippets of them, but I don't know 
anything about them. You don't know anything

14:40.446 --> 14:41.688
about them? No. Of all the people I've asked, only 
John Lindsay has admitted that he was a member, and

14:47.707 --> 14:50.630
they did exist. The only thing that I was a member 
of, anything like that, was something called the

14:51.091 --> 14:57.698
Fine Guys Association that Ed Cooper started. And 
Ed Cooper and Kent Caperton and Roger Miller and I

14:58.619 --> 15:17.140
and Chet Edwards and a whole bunch of guys under 
Cooper's great direction founded the Fine Guys

14:58.619 --> 15:17.140
Association, which best I could tell, primary 
purpose was to drink beer.

15:19.786 --> 15:23.571
And we would always do that at Peggy and Ed's house. 
And then Ed would try to get us home. So y'all didn't

15:28.378 --> 15:31.102
get into much trouble. No. Were there any world 
important off-campus events while you were a

15:32.524 --> 15:38.452
student here? Vietnam War the whole time. 
Everybody was real concerned about that. I mean,

15:44.941 --> 15:49.067
all of us that were in the Corps just assumed You 
know, we had a couple choices. We could quit school

15:51.244 --> 15:59.759
and go in as a private or we could stay and go in as a 
lieutenant and we decided we're going to go in as a

15:51.244 --> 15:59.759
lieutenant and try to see if we can survive that 
way. I remember being in a hall the night that Nixon

15:59.819 --> 16:14.785
drew the lottery and, you know, as everybody's 
number was called, they would groan and go to bed.

16:16.267 --> 16:22.495
And did you guys ever talk about what it might be 
like to go over there? Oh yeah, because we knew

16:22.876 --> 16:34.151
people that would come back from campus all the 
time and would go into our military science

16:22.876 --> 16:34.151
classes and tell us what was going on over there and 
stuff like that. And there was no demonstration

16:34.171 --> 16:37.916
here against the war was there? Zero. If there 
would have been a demonstration on this campus, it

16:38.657 --> 16:42.021
would have been for it. If there was opposition to 
it, which I'm sure there was, it never surfaced at

16:43.267 --> 16:52.661
all. I was trying to think of, like everybody knows 
where they were when they heard that Kennedy had

16:53.442 --> 17:04.798
been shot or D-Day or Pearl Harbor, but there was no 
event like that. What about the moon landing? I was

17:09.285 --> 17:12.970
just getting out of high school. Let's see. 
Student indulgences. Where did students go on a

17:19.538 --> 17:23.261
Saturday night to have a wild time? Ralph's Pizza. 
That's all we had. Where were the favorite beer

17:27.646 --> 17:29.007
halls? Ralph's Pizza. Was Sparky's yet at 
Eastgate? I don't remember that. Ralph's Pizza

17:36.013 --> 17:40.277
was a place over here on, it's not there anymore. 
And Uncle Ed's was gone. I don't remember Uncle Ed.

17:44.676 --> 17:52.947
Down Welborn Road, there was a place run by a Czech 
named Hrdlicka, H-Y-R-D-L-Y-C-K-A, but it was

17:44.676 --> 17:52.947
pronounced Hardlickers. Oh, really? And that, 20 
years before you were here, that was where you

17:54.249 --> 17:59.715
could walk down about a half mile. No, Rouse 
Pizza's about all we had, and then there was a

18:00.416 --> 18:09.087
couple of dance halls, Lakeview and Deanville, 
but that's if you just wanted to go get beat up. I

18:10.249 --> 18:11.290
remember Kent Caperton... afforded me that 
opportunity one night in Deanville. He goes over

18:14.261 --> 18:20.091
and picks a fight with some guy about three times, 
of course, everybody's three times bigger in

18:14.261 --> 18:20.091
Caperton. And the guy said, well, you're too 
little to fight. I said, yeah, I know, but I brought

18:23.016 --> 18:28.366
my friend.

18:28.847 --> 18:29.849
We didn't stay very long. Did any of your friends 
ever go buy anything at Whiskey Bridge? When

18:36.430 --> 18:45.421
I was here, out of Highway 6, there was a little 
series of liquor stores. Well, 60, straight west

18:45.541 --> 18:48.765
towards Snook, just across the bridge. I don't 
know. I remember hearing about Whiskey Bridge.

18:52.991 --> 18:57.556
Where we always went to buy our whiskey was 
straight out of Highway 6. There was a place on the

18:57.957 --> 19:02.843
right before it all got voted in here, and we'd just 
get it all from there. Let's go back to athletic

19:03.194 --> 19:07.702
times. Describe your going on a court trip. Did you 
go as a freshman? Uh-huh. Where? We usually did two

19:14.773 --> 19:16.056
a year. It was usually Houston. Austin was usually 
one of them, obviously, every other year. And then

19:22.547 --> 19:23.969
Houston was one. And Fort Worth usually was one. 
Dallas. How did you get up there? But we'd go with

19:29.553 --> 19:31.856
somebody that had a car. Where would you stay? A 
cheap hotel. Okay. And then what would y'all do on

19:36.240 --> 19:38.403
Friday night? We would what you call drink whiskey 
and drink beer. And, you know, everybody would

19:44.289 --> 19:47.993
usually have a date for something like that. How 
did you get those dates? Oh, well, mine usually

19:50.656 --> 19:54.421
came from Kingsville. Oh, so you're... Yeah, or 
somebody, there was a whole bunch of fixing up,

19:56.030 --> 20:00.355
too. I mean, somebody from Dallas, oh, I've got, 
you know, a sister with 10 friends or something

20:00.455 --> 20:12.108
like that, and so that was a... Do you remember any 
court trip anecdotes that are worth sharing? No,

20:13.850 --> 20:17.334
just trying to remember them is a real challenge. 
Amusing or goofy or... No. What if you literally

20:20.777 --> 20:24.401
couldn't go on that court trip? Was there any 
punishment? When, on Monday? I don't know of

20:28.268 --> 20:30.410
anybody that never, that missed it. I don't think 
it was an optional deal. I mean, you had to be

20:32.613 --> 20:35.055
pretty, pretty sick. That was a, yeah. And how did 
the spectators on the street respond to the

20:37.378 --> 20:41.923
chorus? I was always shocked. You know, I never was 
big on parades. I wouldn't go to, you know, it's

20:45.386 --> 20:53.395
kind of like rodeos, you know, once you've been to 
one, once you've ridden in one, why do you want to go

20:45.386 --> 20:53.395
again? But it was, Oh, it was just real uplifting, I 
guess is the best word, to go through Houston and

20:55.548 --> 21:05.959
see people ten deep just there for the Corps and the 
band. And Austin, you know, I remember the first

21:06.980 --> 21:19.734
time I ever went to the Corps trip in Austin, I 
thought, well, God, these people are going to be

21:06.980 --> 21:19.734
throwing stuff at us, but there's so many darn 
Aggies in Austin, you know, and they were all

21:06.980 --> 21:19.734
there. I said, no, it was a, We were always pretty 
amazed at the number of people that would turn out,

21:20.945 --> 21:25.672
particularly Houston and Austin. Do you have any 
special court trip memory or something? No, I'm

21:28.516 --> 21:34.244
sure I do, but I can't think of any.

21:35.025 --> 21:38.790
Let's do a football Saturday here. Describe what 
it was like for you as a student. What did you do

21:42.375 --> 21:43.677
when?

21:46.721 --> 21:50.867
Well, your date would usually come in on Friday, 
and they'd figure out how to get their selves here

21:51.320 --> 22:00.030
and come to your dormitory, be screamed at 
properly by all the people hanging out the windows

21:51.320 --> 22:00.030
and stuff. And then probably, oh, maybe a dance or 
something like that that was some student

22:00.905 --> 22:10.216
sponsored event. Usually a concert. We had great 
concerts. I mean, MSC put on really good concerts

22:12.338 --> 22:17.184
with Chris Christopherson. Whoever was hot at the 
time was always here. And so it was pretty easy to

22:19.207 --> 22:26.375
get a date to come see the Beach Boys or come see 
somebody that was playing at the time. And we'd

22:26.415 --> 22:28.077
usually go to that. And then Saturdays were pretty 
hectic because you had to do the core stuff too.

22:35.519 --> 22:37.182
What time did those Saturdays begin? Oh, it was 6. I 
mean, you know, because you had to do all the core

22:41.208 --> 22:46.235
stuff. The rooms had to be sparkling because all 
the parents and dates and all were going to be

22:46.456 --> 22:55.349
coming up there, so everything had to be just right 
and had to be inspected and all this kind of stuff.

22:56.010 --> 22:57.372
Uniforms had to be perfect. and then you know the 
depending on the time of the game your dates would

22:58.094 --> 23:27.713
come in and then you they would we would form up in 
the core behind the band and go to the stadium and

22:58.094 --> 23:27.713
our dates would walk along beside us and then go to 
our whatever seats we had and then we'd do the

22:58.094 --> 23:27.713
review inside and then go go to the seats and 
usually Well, I guess usually after the game was

23:28.520 --> 23:34.991
generally when you had the concert. It was usually 
Saturday night or something like that. And Friday

23:36.994 --> 23:48.293
night would be midnight Yale practice and 
students, women students or whoever from other

23:36.994 --> 23:48.293
campuses always thought that was... And they were 
held in the stadium. They were what? Were they in

23:49.655 --> 23:51.979
the stadium then or... See, earlier they'd been at 
the Y steps, but Midnight Yale practice was in the

23:52.297 --> 23:57.323
stadium. In the stadium. But all we did back then, 
we just filled up the horseshoe. I mean, we didn't

24:00.847 --> 24:03.711
go like it does now. My first Midnight Yale 
practice, Rick Peer and I ran out of the stadium.

24:10.459 --> 24:15.165
Well, we were...

24:16.765 --> 24:18.047
I'm sure we weren't drunk. I'm sure we were just 
exuberant because it was our first minute of air

24:18.287 --> 24:22.453
practice. For some reason we decided that we were 
going to go down on the field and we could be yell

24:23.154 --> 24:29.583
leaders too and we were going to help these people 
out. They gently pushed us and then somebody threw

24:31.125 --> 24:36.833
an M-80 at us. And so we crawled into, this is a 
terrible story, but we crawled into, remember

24:37.842 --> 24:45.336
they had grass at the time and those big old tubes 
that rolled the corks out? We crawled into one of

24:45.737 --> 24:46.899
those. Somebody thought that was lots of fun, so 
they threw an M-80 in there with us. And when that

24:52.970 --> 24:56.897
thing went off, I mean, it just, it was just 
deafening. And so we ran toward the other end of the

24:56.937 --> 25:00.103
field. And we didn't see Rick until the game. We 
don't know where he's been tonight. But somehow I

25:08.444 --> 25:11.227
managed to find my way back. But it was, I don't even 
remember our first shell practice. Now, when you

25:15.473 --> 25:17.255
were a senior. I was much better behaved when I was a 
senior. Were you, your date in those days, is she

25:20.178 --> 25:25.585
your wife now? No, I didn't meet her until later. 
But when I was a senior, I was dating a girl that was

25:29.740 --> 25:38.019
an A&M student, Merrill Mitchell. Describe what 
the student body president had to do on a football

25:40.264 --> 25:45.396
Saturday. Did you have any? Usually, yeah, 
usually had a little former student deal where the

25:48.337 --> 26:10.621
big money guys with the former student 
association would come in and they'd want the

25:48.337 --> 26:10.621
corps commander and the student body president to 
come say a few words about how, you know, how much we

25:48.337 --> 26:10.621
appreciate their support and it was a, you guys are 
doing great and I give more money kind of deal. And I

26:10.661 --> 26:12.023
spent a lot of time doing that. I would, on 
weekends, They'd fly me to Tyler to go speak to the

26:15.059 --> 26:20.908
Tyler A&M Club, which is a pretty neat deal for a kid 
from Placido. They're putting you on a King Air

26:20.928 --> 26:32.887
with your date and sending you to Tyler to go speak 
to a bunch of wealthy former students about why

26:20.928 --> 26:32.887
they need to keep giving to A&M. And so I did a bunch 
of that, particularly on weekends and stuff like

26:32.927 --> 26:37.654
that. But on a football weekend... It was like 
every Saturday morning, bright and early, a

26:39.815 --> 26:46.325
breakfast deal with the Association of Former 
Students. Buck Wires would have some deal for me to

26:46.425 --> 27:03.973
go speak to, and then after the game, there'd be 
another gathering of former students somewhere,

26:46.425 --> 27:03.973
and I'd go by there, generally with the Corps 
commander and the civilian student president,

26:46.425 --> 27:03.973
and show them what clean-cut kids we were. Then 
where did you stand during the game? Which

27:07.237 --> 27:07.978
students? You were in the students. Was there a 
reserved seat for the student body president? No.

27:14.765 --> 27:18.850
And then after the game... Our parents got pretty 
good seats. After the game, were things kind of

27:18.870 --> 27:22.153
relaxed for you? Yeah, nothing to do. Sometimes 
Sunday morning there'd be another bleary-eyed

27:24.836 --> 27:29.301
speech. And your senior year is the fall of 71. Fall 
of 71, graduated May of 72. And we didn't do well in

27:36.200 --> 27:38.522
football that year, did we? Was that Emory's first 
year? Yeah, I don't think we did well four years

27:40.664 --> 27:44.887
that I was there. I mean, we started kissing our 
dates on first downs. And Gene Stallings was the

27:47.910 --> 27:51.213
coach during most of that. Most of the time, and 
Emory Ballard after that. Let's see. Describe

27:56.257 --> 27:59.480
going to basketball games in G. Raleigh in those 
days. Dangerous. dangerous if you were the

28:02.114 --> 28:05.358
opposing team and you did a layup. See back in those 
days they would seat Billy Hobbs and all these guys

28:05.959 --> 28:21.598
right under the baskets and so if a guy from Baylor 
comes up and does a layup and they push him into the

28:05.959 --> 28:21.598
crowd I mean it was not a good deal. I mean they'd 
beat the hell out of him five or six times before

28:21.698 --> 28:27.565
they sent him back on the field And it was, I mean, 
that was a common deal. I don't know if they still do

28:30.062 --> 28:41.557
that or not, but that seating was very close, and it 
seemed like almost every game something broke out

28:30.062 --> 28:41.557
in the D.O.U. And the team was winning. Basketball 
was doing good. That's what I mean. Yeah, Shelby.

28:46.824 --> 28:47.565
And it was noisy. Very noisy, big time, huge noise. 
Were there any favorite opponents? We had a real

28:54.494 --> 28:59.501
serious hate for Rice during the four years that I 
was there. Rice was always, you know, Rice little

28:59.561 --> 29:13.340
band made a picture of a fire hydrant one time and 
darn near emptied the football stadium. People

29:13.961 --> 29:16.244
got so mad about that. You know, Rice was not well 
loved at the time. A&M traditions.

29:28.633 --> 29:29.335
Silver taps. Describe going to silver taps. You 
said a member of your squadron died. The first

29:36.146 --> 29:44.920
silver taps we had as fish was for the guy that lived 
next door to me, a guy named Tom Stein from Honda.

29:45.659 --> 29:58.917
And so it was, I mean, I'm sure it was a moving 
experience for everybody that was there, but for

29:45.659 --> 29:58.917
those of us that had known this guy through fish 
camp and for maybe a month, it was a, boy, it was a

29:45.659 --> 29:58.917
real gut-wrenching deal. But it stayed that way 
the whole time. I mean, it almost, almost always, I

30:01.000 --> 30:09.371
mean, the school was small enough then where we 
almost always met that guy or girl, whoever it was.

30:10.333 --> 30:14.198
And it probably happened five or six times during 
the year, a car wreck or some deal like that. And

30:15.934 --> 30:17.997
y'all always took it seriously? Always 
seriously, eerily quiet, not a word. Went back to

30:21.661 --> 30:36.720
our dormitories and if you had to study you had to 
put a black quilt over your deal to make sure and

30:21.661 --> 30:36.720
there was somebody in a corps walking around those 
dorms making sure that no light came out of those

30:21.661 --> 30:36.720
dorms until the morning. Describe Bonfire your 
freshman year. Well, bonfire freshman year, we

30:41.043 --> 30:44.708
were out in the woods. And so we didn't get close to 
the stack. We were out there. Somebody was cutting

30:49.654 --> 30:51.176
the trees down. We were cutting the branches off 
and then loading the stuff on the stick. And so we

30:55.681 --> 31:07.716
stayed out in the woods for a week or whatever it was 
and never saw the bonfire in the daylight until the

30:55.681 --> 31:07.716
morning before it was built. And we did that for the 
whole year. four years, that was our job. And it was

31:12.095 --> 31:13.036
held where? Bonfire was located over on the other 
side of Duncan, over there. And the shape of

31:18.945 --> 31:28.319
Bonfire in your years was about how many stacks 
high?

31:29.361 --> 31:32.345
I think my senior year was one of the years where it 
was 107 feet. Oh, that was one of the tall years.

31:34.529 --> 31:35.610
Yeah, it was. But we wrapped the...
