WEBVTT

00:04.604 --> 00:06.587
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

00:06.607 --> 00:11.494
And so I was kind of late in thinking about graduate school.

00:13.016 --> 00:17.222
I had a professor of foreign management named Joe Campbell.

00:19.685 --> 00:23.010
And Joe Campbell.

00:23.030 --> 00:24.031
But this was Campbell.

00:25.513 --> 00:30.059
And he had taken a liking to me and taken me under his wing.

00:30.380 --> 00:31.962
And I was talking to him one day.

00:33.106 --> 00:35.049
And he said, do you want to go to graduate school?

00:35.069 --> 00:38.855
He said, he had a PhD from Cornell.

00:38.875 --> 00:43.602
He said, I've got some good friends at Purdue.

00:43.682 --> 00:47.247
I can get you an assistantship there.

00:47.387 --> 00:50.492
Or he said, I'll see if I can get you an assistantship.

00:50.512 --> 00:51.533
So I said, fine.

00:51.794 --> 00:55.519
And sure enough, he got me an assistantship, of course.

00:55.539 --> 01:00.126
Then when Korean War broke out, I didn't know what I was going to do or what to do.

01:00.106 --> 01:03.396
whether I should go ahead or whether to wait to be called or what.

01:03.716 --> 01:09.092
It was obvious that they didn't need green second lieutenants.

01:10.336 --> 01:11.820
They needed experienced people.

01:13.150 --> 01:24.226
So I decided to go on to Purdue and then just kept going and was able to finish all the coursework and finish my dissertation before I got called.

01:26.669 --> 01:29.393
But let me back up.

01:29.453 --> 01:31.456
There was something I wanted to say.

01:31.636 --> 01:34.761
Oh, professors who made an influence.

01:34.861 --> 01:37.104
Yes.

01:38.446 --> 01:42.111
I had a professor, Robertson, taught animal nutrition.

01:44.774 --> 02:01.035
In the first class period, he said, it is essential if you are going to be a professional, if you're going to be an educated professional, that you be able to write well.

02:01.876 --> 02:08.224
And he said, I am going to grade in this course as much on your writing as on the content, your subject.

02:08.705 --> 02:09.786
George Robertson.

02:10.694 --> 02:16.902
He went from here to LSU and had been very active in Phi Kappa Phi.

02:18.063 --> 02:20.146
But anyway, that was one of the professors.

02:21.587 --> 02:30.318
And Professor Allen told me to go into the advanced English literature courses.

02:30.378 --> 02:34.723
There were people like that that made an influence.

02:34.743 --> 02:39.469
Describe registration for courses at that era.

02:40.748 --> 02:41.249
Terrible.

02:41.950 --> 02:42.431
Terrible.

02:42.451 --> 02:43.172
What an ordeal.

02:45.115 --> 02:50.885
You had to go to Sabisa Hall and the lines were interminable.

02:51.686 --> 02:57.395
You had to get your cards and then go to the desk and see if there was space in the classes.

02:57.956 --> 03:01.963
Although I never had any problem not being able to get the courses I needed.

03:03.023 --> 03:09.816
It was just the problem of the standing in line, interminable lines.

03:10.357 --> 03:18.231
Did it also, though, ensure that the students took pretty well what they needed to take?

03:20.557 --> 03:26.025
Oh yes, particularly the first two years we had block courses.

03:26.045 --> 03:31.033
And so if you were in a degree program you took those.

03:31.053 --> 03:39.085
Was there a key assistant or associate dean in agriculture then that was the one you checked with before you left like R.C.

03:39.145 --> 03:40.287
Potts would be later?

03:42.157 --> 03:44.588
I'm sure it was, but I don't remember.

03:45.190 --> 03:51.880
My recollection is that we had much less freedom

03:53.429 --> 04:01.678
that the course structure was more rigid and particularly the first two years were just automatic.

04:05.322 --> 04:17.256
Important extracurricular events, groups, activities, you were in town hall and so forth.

04:17.857 --> 04:18.998
What were the other

04:20.362 --> 04:23.748
high visibility, the band certainly.

04:23.788 --> 04:25.611
What did you and your buddies think of the band?

04:27.013 --> 04:34.246
Oh, well, I think it was a love-hate relationship.

04:34.546 --> 04:38.894
We were proud of them, and I'd say extremely proud of them.

04:39.936 --> 04:44.243
But on the other hand, we couldn't stand them as individuals.

04:45.185 --> 04:50.851
I think they had a cockiness about them that kind of set them apart.

04:51.491 --> 04:52.893
Now, they lived as an outfit.

04:52.953 --> 04:54.294
Yes.

04:54.314 --> 04:59.599
And did they participate in other activities like all the other outfits did?

05:00.941 --> 05:03.944
Or did they excuse themselves?

05:04.685 --> 05:05.966
Were they in intramurals?

05:06.166 --> 05:07.567
Oh, yes, they were in intramurals.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.091
No, they, they were,

05:13.433 --> 05:18.803
They were just regular corps members and they, that was an additional responsibility they had.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.606
What about singing cadets?

05:22.469 --> 05:23.070
Yeah.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.713
Were they, and were they respected?

05:25.154 --> 05:26.176
Oh yes, yes.

05:27.738 --> 05:30.423
And I don't think, of course there were fewer of them.

05:31.786 --> 05:34.210
I don't recall any kind of,

05:36.147 --> 05:40.335
feeling that they were cocky or I think they were just regular.

05:41.076 --> 05:43.561
How prestigious was it to be a yell eater then?

05:44.082 --> 05:44.823
Oh, extremely.

05:47.828 --> 05:51.575
Now, the most prestigious student position was corps commander?

05:55.262 --> 05:56.003
Well, I'm not sure.

05:56.063 --> 06:00.231
Head yell eater would be right up there.

06:00.835 --> 06:03.338
Because there was no student body president.

06:03.418 --> 06:04.280
No, no, oh no.

06:04.560 --> 06:10.448
No, everything was just the, well, each class had its officers.

06:10.768 --> 06:11.149
Okay.

06:11.890 --> 06:21.282
And then the corps had its officers, but the corps commander was that and the student body president.

06:22.103 --> 06:28.632
As far as you were aware, what were the key pathways to becoming corps commander?

06:31.717 --> 06:33.239
Were they selected on their merits?

06:35.401 --> 06:37.003
As far as I could tell, they were.

06:37.023 --> 06:45.974
I never, I wasn't aware of any politics or anything of that nature.

06:46.234 --> 06:48.897
Were you aware that secret fraternities existed?

06:50.519 --> 06:53.843
Well, I always heard about them, but,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.324
I never saw any direct evidence, never aware of it.

07:00.386 --> 07:01.687
And I'm still not aware of any.

07:01.707 --> 07:05.132
Did you hear of the names of the organization?

07:06.653 --> 07:07.214
What was it?

07:07.595 --> 07:09.077
True Texans, was that one?

07:09.097 --> 07:11.560
TTs.

07:13.642 --> 07:21.332
I just never, you know, you would hear, but I never heard any.

07:21.667 --> 07:24.413
Any really rumors that I put any faith into?

07:25.555 --> 07:29.924
Just vague references occasionally, but even there a very few times.

07:30.465 --> 07:39.643
Now, when anybody explored the steam tunnels, what was the purpose of going into the steam tunnels?

07:39.663 --> 07:40.745
Oh, all kinds of things.

07:41.106 --> 07:42.088
I mean, go.

07:44.245 --> 07:48.891
First place just to go in the steam tunnel was an activity.

07:48.911 --> 07:50.734
And where did they extend?

07:50.754 --> 07:51.655
Oh all over the campus.

07:52.156 --> 07:56.181
Any building with heat or any building with heat had them.

07:56.201 --> 07:57.222
What were their dimensions?

07:58.124 --> 07:59.005
Oh you could walk in them.

07:59.606 --> 08:00.267
Standing up?

08:00.287 --> 08:01.128
Yeah.

08:01.148 --> 08:01.909
Oh yeah.

08:01.929 --> 08:09.899
In fact probably oh I'd say eight feet high by maybe six feet wide.

08:10.701 --> 08:11.822
What kind of light?

08:14.722 --> 08:23.335
Well, as I recall, we used to have to take flashlights, but I also recall seeing lights too.

08:24.416 --> 08:39.819
They were probably locked by the end of my freshman year because I just don't remember any specific acts.

08:39.899 --> 08:42.062
I just remember being in them.

08:43.814 --> 08:47.919
And then painting the water tower, of course, was a big, big.

08:48.159 --> 08:49.221
Oh, talk about that.

08:49.241 --> 08:54.867
You had to put your outfit, you had to get your outfit insignia up there on the water tower.

08:56.409 --> 08:57.951
And then, of course, that was a big deal.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.534
Now, how did one get up the water tower?

09:00.594 --> 09:01.055
Climbed.

09:02.316 --> 09:04.859
How far up was the bottom rung of the ladder?

09:05.400 --> 09:06.061
I don't remember.

09:06.762 --> 09:07.443
We never did it.

09:07.623 --> 09:08.043
Oh, you didn't?

09:08.904 --> 09:11.948
No, but different groups would.

09:12.113 --> 09:15.457
I mean there were always, new insignia were always appearing up there.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.164
And I hope no sad stories of someone falling off.

09:20.184 --> 09:28.695
I don't remember any, vaguely remember people being caught, but I don't remember any.

09:30.257 --> 09:32.020
And this is the water tower at Northgate.

09:34.363 --> 09:38.408
I was the only one at that time.

09:40.936 --> 09:53.454
And in terms of travel, even when you were a senior, the bus and the train and hitchhiking, automobiles and hitchhiking.

09:53.854 --> 10:01.645
Well by the time I was a senior I had enough friends and acquaintances with cars that weren't doing any hitchhiking.

10:02.386 --> 10:05.070
But the trains were frequent.

10:05.591 --> 10:07.894
Oh yeah.

10:07.914 --> 10:10.538
As late as 1955 we had.

10:11.395 --> 10:17.743
I think five trains a day out of here each way.

10:18.604 --> 10:22.129
Was there a landing strip yet at where Easterwood is now?

10:22.409 --> 10:23.630
Yeah.

10:23.650 --> 10:24.091
Yeah.

10:24.111 --> 10:24.672
But no commercial?

10:24.692 --> 10:26.114
I don't remember any commercial service.

10:29.638 --> 10:30.779
Student indulgences.

10:30.799 --> 10:33.623
What did, did people smoke?

10:34.750 --> 10:36.612
Oh yeah, smoking was widespread.

10:38.293 --> 10:38.854
In the dorms?

10:39.534 --> 10:39.755
Yes.

10:39.915 --> 10:40.916
Could you smoke in your room?

10:41.256 --> 10:41.476
Yes.

10:42.697 --> 10:43.818
What were the popular brands?

10:47.121 --> 10:47.842
I don't remember.

10:47.882 --> 10:49.664
I mean Camels, Lucky Strike.

10:51.265 --> 10:56.250
That was in the day before Marlboro and those, I'd say Camels and Lucky Strike.

10:56.770 --> 10:57.451
Were you a smoker?

10:57.711 --> 10:57.871
No.

10:59.173 --> 11:00.814
Did anybody tease you for not being?

11:01.275 --> 11:01.435
No.

11:02.936 --> 11:03.897
No.

11:04.484 --> 11:05.145
Cigars?

11:05.445 --> 11:06.627
Did anybody smoke cigars?

11:08.329 --> 11:09.531
Oh, when was it?

11:12.415 --> 11:14.958
There was one occasion when we smoked cigars.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.360
What was it?

11:16.380 --> 11:17.501
Baseball games.

11:17.521 --> 11:19.104
What, you mean a kind of celebration?

11:20.866 --> 11:22.408
No, it was the custom to do it.

11:22.628 --> 11:22.768
Oh.

11:22.969 --> 11:28.416
Golly, I can't remember.

11:30.033 --> 11:31.355
May have been baseball games.

11:31.675 --> 11:32.036
Pipes?

11:33.237 --> 11:33.858
I don't remember.

11:33.898 --> 11:34.779
Very few pipes.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.722
Chewing tobacco or snuff?

11:39.685 --> 11:41.488
My impression, not as much as today.

11:43.811 --> 11:46.134
But I just may not have noticed it.

11:46.955 --> 11:51.481
In my experience, that was, chewing tobacco and snuff was considered country.

11:53.043 --> 11:53.383
Yeah.

11:53.403 --> 11:54.064
Is that?

11:54.084 --> 11:54.184
Yeah.

11:55.666 --> 12:01.051
Did you and your buddies, had you even heard the terminology of today's drugs?

12:05.555 --> 12:05.615
No.

12:05.635 --> 12:06.797
I hadn't, I hadn't either.

12:07.137 --> 12:08.098
No.

12:09.479 --> 12:13.062
And what about alcohol?

12:13.443 --> 12:14.264
Was Whiskey Bridge?

12:18.147 --> 12:18.247
Yeah.

12:18.267 --> 12:23.192
Well, camp was supposed to be dry, but I had slept there.

12:24.370 --> 12:31.762
And, you know, on this today of human rights, you can't conceive of what they did.

12:31.822 --> 12:38.233
I mean, they'd search your room for whiskey.

12:38.273 --> 12:40.877
Where did people hide whiskey or beer in there?

12:42.055 --> 12:43.898
In their foot lockers.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.001
Or in their closet.

12:47.483 --> 12:49.667
And we had a chest of drawers in the room.

12:50.148 --> 12:52.471
Did any of that ever get dropped in the wall, I wonder?

12:52.932 --> 12:53.833
No, I don't remember that.

12:53.853 --> 12:57.179
It was just the boards that I remember.

12:57.199 --> 13:00.984
Now, no whiskey illegally sold in this county.

13:01.746 --> 13:04.570
Did you ever hear of a bootlegger in Brazos County?

13:04.550 --> 13:07.394
Oh, heard of them, but.

13:07.795 --> 13:09.397
Where were they supposed to be?

13:09.417 --> 13:09.677
I don't know.

13:09.697 --> 13:11.680
I just learned and lost.

13:11.900 --> 13:15.005
Where could beer be bought?

13:15.025 --> 13:15.726
I don't remember.

13:18.450 --> 13:19.091
Uncle Ed's?

13:19.111 --> 13:25.159
Since I don't or didn't drink, I just didn't pay attention to that.

13:30.207 --> 13:30.647
There you see.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.650
Notable campus personalities.

13:33.862 --> 13:38.667
All right, you go to summer camp to San Antonio.

13:38.907 --> 13:41.089
Did you go to summer camp any other time?

13:41.129 --> 13:42.290
That's the one summer.

13:42.871 --> 13:43.511
All right.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.454
Describe then what it was like to be a senior to arrive.

13:46.494 --> 13:48.156
That would have been the fall of 40?

13:48.176 --> 13:49.117
49.

13:49.137 --> 13:57.565
Well, it was a great feeling to reach the pinnacle.

13:59.687 --> 14:00.528
Have your boots and.

14:01.909 --> 14:02.670
Where'd you get your boots?

14:03.798 --> 14:04.779
I got them used.

14:05.701 --> 14:06.442
How much did they cost?

14:07.443 --> 14:08.725
A hundred dollars as I recall.

14:09.106 --> 14:09.667
Did they fit?

14:10.788 --> 14:11.209
Pretty well.

14:12.491 --> 14:29.957
Although I had ridden horseback so much that my calves were developed, maybe a little overdeveloped, and they were a little tight in the calf.

14:31.928 --> 14:33.510
That was the main problem.

14:33.530 --> 14:37.134
How did you feel when you put them on ceremoniously the first time?

14:38.575 --> 14:39.236
Top of the world.

14:40.958 --> 14:43.781
Now that would have been that final review as a junior?

14:44.021 --> 14:46.664
Yes, yes.

14:46.684 --> 14:51.909
All right, describe the routine as a junior of final review.

14:55.413 --> 14:56.815
It was where and you all did.

14:56.835 --> 14:59.978
Well, it was on the drill field where it is today.

15:00.953 --> 15:05.884
We passed in review with the graduating seniors

15:06.691 --> 15:29.618
in command and then we dismissed and seniors went to rooms and got their boots and came back and freshmen tore off their fish stripes and our juniors had uniforms with their stripes on them and so forth.

15:29.898 --> 15:32.101
And about how long a break was that?

15:34.103 --> 15:35.905
Oh, 30 to 45 minutes.

15:36.458 --> 15:38.302
Do you remember who the reviewing officer was?

15:38.382 --> 15:40.527
Was anybody of any great significance?

15:43.393 --> 15:46.299
When I graduated, Omar Bradley.

15:48.404 --> 15:53.455
I don't remember my junior year, but Omar Bradley was

15:54.937 --> 15:58.742
commissioning speaker my senior year.

15:58.762 --> 16:00.024
What did you people think of him?

16:00.424 --> 16:01.846
Oh, he stood in awe.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.610
He was a man like that.

16:04.870 --> 16:09.156
Was there anything special he said about Aggies or A&M?

16:09.176 --> 16:09.857
I don't remember.

16:12.020 --> 16:16.646
All right, so you put on those senior boots officially for the first time.

16:17.267 --> 16:21.653
Was there anybody special that was here for you then that day?

16:22.291 --> 16:23.532
Well my parents were here.

16:23.873 --> 16:24.153
They came?

16:24.493 --> 16:27.136
She was supposed to have been.

16:27.156 --> 16:32.301
We had torrential rains and she got unable to come.

16:32.341 --> 16:33.162
Where did you all meet?

16:33.822 --> 16:34.503
Describe that.

16:35.644 --> 16:39.788
She was a student at Huntsville, Sam Houston.

16:39.808 --> 16:52.180
I had a fellow in my outfit, a classmate, who kept telling me I got just the girl for you, I got just the girl for you.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.735
I didn't trust his judgment that well.

16:57.137 --> 17:02.762
Finally, in my junior year, he talked me into going over to Huntsville, or Line 8.

17:04.044 --> 17:04.885
That's where it started.

17:05.085 --> 17:06.266
Now, did you have wheels then?

17:07.147 --> 17:08.008
No, he had a car.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.413
I never did have a car.

17:12.433 --> 17:14.735
I brought my mother's car back two or three times.

17:15.996 --> 17:18.619
And she was what year when you met her in school?

17:18.679 --> 17:18.920
Same.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.183
You were both juniors, majoring in?

17:22.163 --> 17:24.766
She was majoring in education.

17:24.986 --> 17:25.587
Education.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.490
And where did you all go on the first date?

17:29.211 --> 17:30.973
Was it a movie or a dance?

17:30.993 --> 17:31.914
Did we eat at the Raven?

17:33.456 --> 17:34.577
We went to a movie, I think.

17:36.019 --> 17:40.363
I think we ate at the Raven in the cafe on the square.

17:40.403 --> 17:41.505
It used to be famous.

17:42.526 --> 17:48.272
Then after that first date, did you give that buddy any kind of evaluation of his judgment?

17:48.312 --> 17:49.774
Yeah, yeah.

17:50.564 --> 17:51.525
I was smitten.

17:51.545 --> 17:53.047
It was love at first sight.

17:53.067 --> 17:54.789
And how often did you then see her?

17:56.191 --> 18:03.821
Well, the problem was she had some others that she .

18:03.841 --> 18:09.348
So I was playing second or third fiddle.

18:09.428 --> 18:11.210
When did this become mutually serious?

18:17.018 --> 18:20.402
She'll have to answer that.

18:21.817 --> 18:32.269
In fact, she followed one of them to Nashville, Tennessee, the summer after she graduated.

18:32.690 --> 18:39.297
So it was after that, and I guess she changed her mind then.

18:41.159 --> 18:44.563
Okay, what did you do the summer before your senior year?

18:45.404 --> 18:47.467
That was summer camp.

18:47.507 --> 18:48.768
Oh, that's the summer camp.

18:48.908 --> 18:51.351
That was summer camp between your junior and senior year.

18:52.057 --> 18:57.565
All right, so you arrive, describe being a senior at Texas A&M in 1949.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.272
Well, you're kind of the king of the walk.

19:03.774 --> 19:05.817
What was the great, great feeling?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.921
What made it great?

19:08.941 --> 19:15.431
Well, you'd come through all the trials, get there, and you'd arrived.

19:17.634 --> 19:18.435
I guess...

19:19.580 --> 19:25.594
thing about the core experience was that it proved to me that I could survive anything.

19:27.699 --> 19:31.648
About what was the survival rate of your freshman class?

19:32.129 --> 19:32.931
About a third.

19:34.244 --> 19:36.828
I mean the attrition was just incredible.

19:37.989 --> 19:47.643
Of those, how many would you guess left for academic reasons compared to how many who left for other reasons?

19:47.663 --> 19:48.645
That would be a guess.

19:49.206 --> 19:50.247
I'd say half and half.

19:51.649 --> 19:56.496
Because academics was a significant reason for dropping out.

19:57.358 --> 20:01.163
And I think one of the reasons for that was because it was so easy to be admitted then.

20:02.864 --> 20:10.272
There really weren't any admission requirements, and so some of the people that were admitted just didn't have the ability.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.995
Yeah, yeah.

20:13.235 --> 20:16.179
As a senior then, you had someone to clean your room.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.602
No, because we didn't have any freshmen.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.886
See, the freshmen were still out at the annex.

20:22.906 --> 20:23.547
Oh, that's right.

20:23.967 --> 20:29.293
No, as I say, we were the only class, or at least the first class, I guess first class.

20:29.932 --> 20:35.778
to be the low man on the totem pole two years in a row, but that continued throughout.

20:36.058 --> 20:38.661
Was a paddle used in your outfit when you were a senior?

20:38.761 --> 20:38.981
Yes.

20:39.522 --> 20:41.243
Did you do anything to prevent it?

20:41.263 --> 20:41.444
No.

20:44.126 --> 20:48.691
And in your squadron, what position did you have?

20:50.052 --> 20:54.737
I was... I've forgotten.

20:56.419 --> 20:57.880
I was a major on...

21:00.070 --> 21:05.920
And was Gilchrist still the president?

21:06.321 --> 21:06.522
No.

21:10.489 --> 21:11.751
Tom Harrington may have been.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.773
Harrington, okay.

21:14.336 --> 21:15.458
Did you all see much of him?

21:15.478 --> 21:16.880
Did you have any impression of him?

21:17.161 --> 21:19.144
Yes, he was very visible.

21:19.345 --> 21:24.053
What did you all think of him?

21:27.172 --> 21:29.574
My impression was favorable.

21:30.095 --> 21:34.399
I think everybody felt good about it.

21:34.740 --> 21:37.022
What did y'all think was special about Texas A&M?

21:39.885 --> 21:40.926
Why all this pride?

21:42.488 --> 21:52.858
I guess this sense of being a big fraternity, big brotherhood,

21:54.644 --> 22:06.275
pride in achievement, that we could survive and finish, and feeling that there was value in an A&M degree.

22:07.576 --> 22:12.040
Now at this point, what did you think your career goal was when you were a senior?

22:13.222 --> 22:13.782
I wasn't sure.

22:14.783 --> 22:17.165
What were you thinking of them?

22:17.185 --> 22:22.170
Well, Dad had pretty well taught me out of coming back

22:23.922 --> 22:25.444
into production agriculture.

22:25.785 --> 22:26.025
Why?

22:29.510 --> 22:35.518
Well, he was probably ahead of his time, could see the problems.

22:35.959 --> 22:38.663
In other words, it was, this was going to be tough.

22:42.288 --> 22:44.631
He graduated from A&M in 26.

22:46.214 --> 22:50.962
His mother was killed in a car wreck in 28.

22:53.046 --> 22:56.652
So he had inherited his land free and clear.

22:58.515 --> 23:01.220
And he was in good shape going into the Depression.

23:03.523 --> 23:06.489
But that made such a lasting impression on him.

23:08.492 --> 23:09.133
He

23:11.729 --> 23:16.693
They couldn't find, well, there was no market for anything.

23:17.551 --> 23:24.841
And he heard that they were buying hogs in Lareda, which is 125 miles away, no paved roads.

23:25.982 --> 23:29.587
He has a little Model T truck and he takes hogs to Lareda to sell.

23:32.071 --> 23:37.778
My mother always raised turkeys and a few turkeys, not commercially.

23:37.798 --> 23:41.063
But he took her turkeys and sold them door to door and peddled them in Corpus.

23:42.284 --> 23:45.769
He started night classes at Corpus to

23:46.998 --> 23:50.831
finish up pre-med requirements, thinking that he'd go into medicine.

23:52.697 --> 23:57.092
And so that experience, and then during the thirties he was a leader.

23:57.292 --> 24:14.251
in the agricultural program, went to Washington two or three times, served on the state land use planning committee that was looking at the problems of agricultural land and what to do with the surpluses we had, so forth.

24:14.371 --> 24:23.181
So, he was probably very realistic in terms of his concern for the future.

24:24.292 --> 24:26.157
All right, then if not- Now he did well.

24:27.219 --> 24:30.086
He did very well.

24:30.107 --> 24:34.297
But my poor brothers had terrible time.

24:34.317 --> 24:36.883
And he- Drought and- He went into production.

24:37.244 --> 24:37.525
Yes.

24:38.095 --> 24:44.227
All right, then if you weren't going to go into production agriculture, what were you, what other options were you thinking about?

24:44.327 --> 24:52.463
Well, that's when I started thinking about the academics or maybe banking, some sort of business, agribusiness.

24:53.024 --> 24:59.597
Did you have anybody here, whether they knew it or not, that was a kind of a role model for you?

25:01.079 --> 25:08.506
Well, I say Joe Campbell had taken me under his wing, and I felt I was very grateful for that.

25:08.826 --> 25:15.653
I mean, he took a personal interest in me, and I felt that.

25:19.697 --> 25:30.327
Yeah, there were any number of people here that I respected and looked up to.

25:31.218 --> 25:56.635
Dean Shepardson was a, I don't know how to say it, a pretty outspoken kind of a man who wasn't particularly democratic, I mean diplomatic, but respected him.

25:59.888 --> 26:00.809
Any number of people.

26:00.889 --> 26:07.876
Jack Miller was on the faculty at that time, was the kind of person that I would have looked up to.

26:07.916 --> 26:12.440
Did anybody give you any advice of some options not to consider?

26:13.921 --> 26:14.121
No.

26:15.663 --> 26:15.763
Okay.

26:15.783 --> 26:15.983
No.

26:16.283 --> 26:23.991
I think I felt that options are wide open.

26:24.271 --> 26:26.133
And you were making good grades.

26:26.153 --> 26:26.453
Yes.

26:28.373 --> 26:33.240
I wasn't valedictorian, but I had a good GPR.

26:34.161 --> 26:42.013
Did you all keep up with your GPR as much then as students do now?

26:42.033 --> 26:42.594
Oh, yeah.

26:42.614 --> 26:43.255
Did you?

26:43.575 --> 26:44.757
I and my buddies did not.

26:44.817 --> 26:48.603
We didn't, we couldn't have set a three-point or a two-point.

26:48.623 --> 26:52.288
No, that's always been important here.

26:52.268 --> 26:55.973
But I took as many as 21 hours a semester.

26:56.153 --> 26:57.074
Sure.

26:57.094 --> 26:58.816
These people now talk about 12 hours.

26:59.156 --> 27:03.181
They think that's a full-time load.

27:03.722 --> 27:09.189
Let's talk about what is about Aggie's spirit and so forth.

27:09.609 --> 27:12.553
Do you remember going to your first Silver Taps?

27:13.194 --> 27:13.954
Yes.

27:13.975 --> 27:16.858
What was it?

27:20.197 --> 27:27.450
I don't think I knew the person, or at least knew him well, but in those days you knew just about everybody, small.

27:30.916 --> 27:44.280
It was tremendously impressive, walking over there silently, campus blacked out, and then hearing the silver taps, the taps played, and then just as

27:45.408 --> 27:49.132
Quietly walking back, it was very impressive.

27:49.152 --> 27:52.655
Was there ever any fun and games in the dormitory after Silver Taps?

27:52.675 --> 27:52.915
No.

27:53.316 --> 27:54.477
Oh no, it was a very solemn.

27:55.177 --> 27:56.779
I would have been dumbfounded if you had any.

27:56.799 --> 28:01.604
It made, it just made you aware of your mortality.

28:03.625 --> 28:05.407
Muster, did you go to Muster?

28:07.169 --> 28:10.152
I don't think Muster was as big a deal then as it is today.

28:10.312 --> 28:10.812
No, I don't either.

28:12.094 --> 28:12.894
We had Muster.

28:13.275 --> 28:13.575
Where?

28:15.108 --> 28:18.533
I guess Guyon Hall, or maybe the Assembly Hall, I don't remember.

28:18.754 --> 28:25.183
Assembly Hall was torn down in 40, probably 47.

28:28.268 --> 28:31.373
But Guyon Hall, I imagine.

28:31.393 --> 28:33.596
But you don't remember it being a compulsory?

28:33.977 --> 28:35.098
No, no.

28:38.443 --> 28:40.947
I mean, we had it, but it wasn't a,

28:42.580 --> 28:44.583
Wasn't a big to-do over it, like today.

28:44.603 --> 28:45.303
All right.

28:45.323 --> 28:45.904
Bonfire.

28:45.984 --> 28:48.267
Go back to your freshman year, if you can.

28:48.347 --> 28:51.131
Describe bonfire activities.

28:53.514 --> 28:56.858
Well, we started out, of course, cutting the logs.

28:56.878 --> 28:57.198
Where?

28:58.360 --> 28:59.682
Remember how far away it was?

29:00.623 --> 29:01.384
It wasn't close.

29:02.185 --> 29:11.997
And again, since I didn't have a vehicle, it's hard to remember.

29:14.677 --> 29:20.402
I'm very allergic to poison oak.

29:20.422 --> 29:22.144
So probably don't need to say more about that.

29:22.184 --> 29:28.730
But we had axes and we cut with axes and nobody had a chainsaw.

29:28.890 --> 29:30.051
You know what a chainsaw was.

29:30.191 --> 29:40.520
And everything was cut by axe and hauled out by, hauled to the trucks by, I mean carried to the trucks, stacked on the trucks.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.642
Beginning about when in the fall?

29:44.680 --> 29:47.804
I don't remember exactly, but I would say around the first of October.

29:48.766 --> 29:49.667
So six weeks or so.

29:50.909 --> 29:53.452
And basically on weekends.

29:54.614 --> 29:56.757
I don't remember going out during the week.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.602
And you were in a cutting crew?

30:01.203 --> 30:01.844
Oh, yes.

30:01.864 --> 30:02.825
I think everybody was.

30:03.226 --> 30:04.067
We rotated.

30:04.347 --> 30:06.250
Did you all ever use cross cut saws?

30:07.192 --> 30:09.795
Yes, but I just remember axes.

30:11.697 --> 30:14.340
And they were hauled back in trucks.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.142
Where did those trucks come from?

30:16.422 --> 30:18.044
I don't know.

30:19.966 --> 30:22.809
I want to say some of them might have been military trucks.

30:25.112 --> 30:25.752
I think they were.

30:26.233 --> 30:30.918
Did the cutting crew also load, or was that a different group?

30:30.938 --> 30:32.760
We weren't that specialized.

30:33.281 --> 30:34.142
Everybody pitched in.

30:34.262 --> 30:35.663
Where was Bonfire held?

30:36.264 --> 30:37.165
On the drill field.

30:37.145 --> 30:40.812
And do you remember how many stacks, huh?

30:41.433 --> 30:42.014
Well, just one.

30:42.836 --> 30:43.297
Okay.

30:43.317 --> 30:44.098
Teepee style.

30:44.119 --> 30:45.201
Yeah, teepee style.

30:45.962 --> 30:50.070
And do you remember any feeling about bonfire then?

30:50.892 --> 30:51.513
Oh, yeah.

30:51.533 --> 30:56.262
I was thrilled to see it go up after all that hard work.

30:56.282 --> 30:58.326
But it was, there was some interesting

30:59.369 --> 31:15.304
stories there, and I don't know whether it's true or not, but there's a story about this old Bohemian couple that came up and, that's my outhouse up there.

31:15.324 --> 31:18.711
That was in the days when they used to steal the outhouse.
