00:05.077 --> 00:16.569
This is an interview with retired Army Major 
Edward John Carter by John Martin on November 27,

00:05.077 --> 00:16.569
1988, in San Antonio, Texas, concerning the 
Vietnam War. In the interest of accumulating

00:18.371 --> 00:28.802
knowledge about the war, I am going to donate this 
tape to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection in

00:18.371 --> 00:28.802
the University Archives. Is that all right with 
you? Yes, it is. OK. Can you please state your place

00:34.017 --> 00:38.302
and date of birth? I was born in Spokane, 
Washington on 26 June 1946. OK.

00:42.747 --> 00:53.739
What is the extent of your education before the 
war, and what is it now? Before I entered the

00:55.200 --> 00:58.184
service, I had completed two years of college. 
Since my participation in the Vietnam War, I have

01:04.645 --> 01:13.614
graduated from college and am now in pursuit of a 
master's degree in business administration.

01:13.634 --> 01:15.636
How and why did you join the Army? I joined the Army 
in February of 1967, primarily to beat the draft

01:16.197 --> 01:23.624
because I wanted to fly helicopters. I enlisted 
for the Warrant Officer Flight Program. Okay. Can

01:30.071 --> 01:32.914
you give a brief sketch of your military career?

01:36.522 --> 01:41.827
I completed basic training, Army flight 
training, and attack helicopter training. Went

01:41.867 --> 01:44.289
to Vietnam for one year. Upon completion of my tour 
in Vietnam, I served as an attack helicopter

01:45.851 --> 01:53.258
instructor pilot and was commissioned in armor. 
Served several ground command assignments and

01:53.979 --> 02:04.909
staff assignments, aviation staff and 
operational assignments. and ended up my career

02:05.632 --> 02:18.324
in installation level staff and finally flag 
headquarters staff assignments.

02:18.344 --> 02:22.067
What type of training did you receive before your 
tour in Vietnam? Well, I received a standard basic

02:22.948 --> 02:34.879
training, eight-week basic combat training at 
Fort Pope, Louisiana, followed by my Army flight

02:22.948 --> 02:34.879
training at Fort Walters. Texas, Fort Rucker, 
Alabama, then my attack helicopter training in

02:35.467 --> 02:47.707
Savannah, Georgia prior to going to Vietnam.

02:47.727 --> 02:49.270
When was your tour in Vietnam? This is June 1968, 
June 1969. Okay, and what unit were you with? I was

02:56.982 --> 03:09.453
assigned to Air Cavalry Troop, 11th Armored 
Cavalry Regiment, located in the III Corps area of

02:56.982 --> 03:09.453
Vietnam, more precisely, Ben Hoa area. Do you 
believe the training you received prepare you for

03:09.473 --> 03:13.937
Vietnam? Well, from an operational standpoint 
and learning the tactics of helicopter

03:13.957 --> 03:26.668
employment and attack helicopter employment, I 
think I was very well prepared. I was certainly

03:26.851 --> 03:33.339
very confident in my ability to operate a 
helicopter. When I first got over there, I wasn't

03:33.540 --> 03:43.813
real confident in my ability to conform to tactics 
or just what it would be like to be shot at. I think I

03:46.196 --> 03:48.259
was well prepared. I guess about as well as 
anybody. Was there anything that you weren't

03:54.547 --> 03:56.790
prepared for Well, I can't think of anything. 
Maybe then, other than what would you do if you were

04:01.177 --> 04:09.789
shot down and captured, that was kind of a lax. We 
had probably a week of escape and evasion, which

04:11.031 --> 04:21.306
consisted mostly of an overnight exercise where 
you had to keep from getting caught. But the

04:21.346 --> 04:24.010
pressure wasn't really

04:26.825 --> 04:31.009
like it would be if you were really trying to get 
away from being captured. I don't know, I guess I

04:32.551 --> 04:43.322
always wondered how would I react or what would I do 
if I had been shot down and captured.

04:43.342 --> 04:47.125
What was your biggest fear in Vietnam? Well, being 
an attack helicopter pilot, probably my biggest

04:47.145 --> 04:56.595
fear was killing some of our own people with my 
bullets. several times that

04:57.082 --> 05:02.126
things would be happening. They'd be calling for 
the bullets 25 to 50 meters from their position.

05:07.251 --> 05:19.081
And with the inherent inaccuracy of the rockets, 
it really scared you to shoot that close to the

05:07.251 --> 05:19.081
friendlies. That was probably my biggest fear. 
The next biggest fear was incoming at night. into

05:27.575 --> 05:28.616
our compound. I was trying to sleep.

05:34.664 --> 05:35.866
You know, fear of the unknown. Nothing you can 
control that tends to make you somewhat fearful.

05:43.075 --> 05:46.860
When you were flying, was there ever the fear of 
being shot down or shot at? Oh, sure.

05:50.424 --> 05:53.548
You're always afraid that something's going to 
happen to you, I guess as you spend more time over

05:54.372 --> 06:02.581
there, you tend to lose that fear. You start 
concentrating on your task at hand more

06:02.601 --> 06:12.591
than being shot at until you get close to going 
home. It was really funny. The closer guys used to

06:15.514 --> 06:22.742
get to going home, the higher they'd start flying 
at 100 feet from Mama. 100 feet for baby, 100 feet

06:23.262 --> 06:27.508
for whoever you could think of. It would kind of run 
in, I guess, in a cycle. When you first got there,

06:32.215 --> 06:34.137
you were very cautious. As you got through the 
first third, midway to two-thirds and

06:35.499 --> 06:43.310
three-quarters of your tour, that caution kind of 
started to go away. And then as you got closer to

06:44.331 --> 06:49.759
going home, you'd start to get more cautious 
again.

06:53.435 --> 06:56.179
What were your living conditions like? I had it 
real good. We lived at our Black Horse Base Camp was

06:58.802 --> 07:03.228
the regimental area. It was well established. It 
had been established a couple of years prior to my

07:05.431 --> 07:10.598
arrival with the unit. The area in Benoit that we 
used, all of them, we all lived in wooden hoochies

07:12.200 --> 07:21.653
with metal roofs, plenty of sandbags. We slept on 
cots with air mattresses and mosquito nets. We had

07:27.829 --> 07:32.054
clean clothes and three hot meals if you weren't 
flying through the meal. So we had it real good

07:33.015 --> 07:38.562
compared to the guys in the bush.

07:42.065 --> 07:48.633
What was a typical day in Vietnam, or was there some 
kind of routine that you had? Well, not really. a

07:50.692 --> 07:52.434
set routine. The function of my unit was 
reconnaissance.

07:59.921 --> 08:19.500
The 11th Armored Cab Regiment had three ground 
squadrons, which were comprised of tanks and APCs

07:59.921 --> 08:19.500
and what have you, and one air cab troop, which was 
us, and our mission was to go out and scout around

07:59.921 --> 08:19.500
and try and find signs of the enemy, and at that 
point allow the direct the ground troops into

08:19.835 --> 08:25.223
searching or what have you, that area. There was 
generally two statuses that you could be on. You

08:32.353 --> 08:43.690
would either fly a mission with your OH-6 and what 
we called a pink team, just the two of you out in your

08:32.353 --> 08:43.690
little area trying to find trouble or signs of bad 
guys. Then the other status would be as a fire team,

08:43.770 --> 08:48.036
two Cobras. on standby, ready to go any time. You 
just kind of alternate between those statuses.

08:57.785 --> 09:00.147
Briefings were usually held at 630 in the morning. 
And you just took what the day gave you from that

09:01.248 --> 09:03.851
point on. When you were on call as a fire team, you 
usually sat for a 24-hour period. You couldn't go

09:13.161 --> 09:14.102
anywhere. You had to stay close to the aircraft.

09:18.577 --> 09:28.410
And that's probably where I put in some of my 
longest days, was getting scrambled at 4 o'clock

09:18.577 --> 09:28.410
in the morning and flying pretty much throughout 
the whole day. I had a couple 14- and 16-hour days of

09:28.470 --> 09:34.197
actual flight time in that status. The 
hunter-killer or pink team concept was very

09:34.297 --> 09:43.449
boring for me. The scout was down snooping around 
the area and In the Cobra, you were up above them

09:48.614 --> 09:51.198
just flying in circles. Circles for eight hours a 
day was not a lot of fun.

10:00.070 --> 10:03.295
How was your unit employed to fight the war? 
Primarily in reconnaissance. Our regimental

10:05.919 --> 10:11.206
commander was George S. Patton III. And when he 
assumed command of the regiment, he had paper

10:19.175 --> 10:28.269
mimeographed with the following order placed 
above the doorway of every doorway in the

10:19.175 --> 10:28.269
regimental area. It simply stated, standing 
order for troopers of the 11th US cavalry. Find the

10:34.178 --> 10:35.640
bastards and pile on. And that's the way we lived.

10:41.389 --> 10:47.038
Do you believe your operations were successful in 
fighting the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese

10:41.389 --> 10:47.038
army? Well, I think we were very successful in 
finding the bastards and piling on.

10:56.518 --> 11:09.439
But as far as do I think we were winning or were we 
losing, I don't think I'll ever really know

10:56.518 --> 11:09.439
because it seemed like you never made any headway. 
You were busy in one area. You'd fight them for a

11:14.367 --> 11:15.709
while, You'd go somewhere else, and then you'd end 
up back in the same area again six weeks later. And I

11:20.473 --> 11:25.861
just don't really know that we did any good. We did 
good, but we killed a lot of them. But it seemed like

11:30.669 --> 11:33.654
there were always some there to replace them. And I 
think if the war would have had a more defined

11:34.836 --> 11:43.570
front, you could see moving backwards or 
forwards. so you could determine whether or not

11:44.140 --> 11:47.044
you're losing or winning the war. Probably would 
have been a little easier for everybody to

11:48.185 --> 12:02.923
understand it, but when the front was outside the 
wire, like you say sometimes, inside the wire

11:48.185 --> 12:02.923
doing TAD,

11:48.185 --> 12:02.923
you really don't get a good feeling. You don't get 
any feedback as to your success or failure. All you

12:07.749 --> 12:09.271
know is you're out there every day. Was it 
frustrating? Very frustrating. Very

12:13.085 --> 12:14.426
frustrating. I think most people like to have that 
feedback. Are you doing well or are you not doing

12:20.511 --> 12:24.054
well? You just really didn't get that feedback.

12:28.979 --> 12:31.001
What type of problems were you in? Were there any 
drug problems or problems with careers? People

12:35.765 --> 12:40.489
want to boast their careers or fragging? There 
really wasn't any drug problems at the beginning

12:41.161 --> 12:48.189
of my year in Vietnam. Maybe a crew chief now or then 
would get caught with some marijuana. It started

12:55.017 --> 13:07.392
to get a little worse amongst the blue platoon, the 
air rifle platoon, which was the infantry platoon

12:55.017 --> 13:07.392
we had as part of the unit. Near the end of my tour, 
probably the last three or four months before I

13:09.005 --> 13:13.330
came home. And I think at that point in time, things 
had started to slow down a little bit, and they had

13:13.430 --> 13:23.803
more time on their hands. They weren't out 
actively engaged with the bad guys every day, so

13:24.644 --> 13:35.957
there was a little more tendency, I think, to, to go 
for drugs for something to do. But early in my tour,

13:41.772 --> 13:47.039
the blue platoon was very, very active. They were 
constantly out in the field. So I think they were

13:52.867 --> 13:57.493
probably tended not to use them. As far as the 
pilots using drugs, I only know of one that ever

13:57.513 --> 14:03.141
did. He was in the lift platoon, and he was kind of 
kind of a weirdo anyway, but he got caught and

14:06.633 --> 14:12.340
court-martialed. As far as careerism, yes.

14:19.468 --> 14:23.012
My commanding officer, West Point graduate. In 
fact, Patton was his TAC officer at West Point when

14:24.253 --> 14:32.623
he was a student.

14:35.945 --> 14:40.950
seized this opportunity to move his career up the 
ladder. He eventually retired as a general

14:41.030 --> 14:42.952
officer.

14:45.855 --> 14:50.881
And his mannerisms were quite the same as Patton. 
If you ever watched the movie Patton, the son was

14:51.141 --> 14:57.447
pretty much the same. Wore the pearl handle, 
excuse me, ivory handle, 45. Curls for pimps. And

15:07.692 --> 15:19.186
Bonson was pretty much in the same mold, that type 
of person, personality. Never was any fraggings

15:21.289 --> 15:24.312
while I was there, I think. Fraggings didn't 
become the end thing until after I left, as far as

15:25.073 --> 15:30.941
Vietnam goes. Were there any other problems that 
you can think of

15:38.534 --> 15:44.041
No, as far as just the day-to-day things. Was there 
any racism? No, funny, there wasn't. We had black

15:51.090 --> 15:52.852
pilots and white pilots. In the air rifle 
platoons, there was blacks, whites, Hispanics.

15:58.899 --> 16:01.983
In fact, my best friend in Vietnam was black. We got 
along very well. I think when you get a job to do, and

16:07.795 --> 16:21.035
there's a tough task, the color barriers or racial 
barriers start to go away because everybody's

16:07.795 --> 16:21.035
pulling together, aimed at the accomplishment of 
that one task. From that standpoint, I don't think

16:23.118 --> 16:28.426
they're

16:23.118 --> 16:28.426
learning. What did you think of the Vietnamese 
people and their culture? Well, I thought they

16:33.854 --> 16:35.997
were certainly backward compared to the way I grew 
up. I grew up in primarily an agricultural part of

16:40.468 --> 16:44.912
the United States. And I knew how we farmed. And to 
watch the way they farmed using antiquated

16:48.155 --> 17:04.048
methods, oxen and water buffalo and what have you, 
it just seemed like they weren't smart enough to

16:48.155 --> 17:04.048
keep up with the times. Or maybe they just couldn't 
afford it. I don't know. Their farms were so poor.

17:08.168 --> 17:11.052
The country itself was an absolutely beautiful 
country. It was too bad it had to be scarred by war.

17:17.019 --> 17:18.420
I never really got to know the people. Some of the 
units over there were allowed to have hooch maids,

17:20.783 --> 17:27.791
and people would come and wash their clothes and 
clean their hooch. We weren't allowed to have

17:27.891 --> 17:28.872
them. So we had basically no contact with the 
Vietnamese people at all, or I didn't.

17:36.237 --> 17:40.121
So I really can't comment. Did the Army ever give 
you any type of training on Vietnam or the culture?

17:46.506 --> 17:47.787
The people's culture? No. If they did, it didn't 
impress me or I slept through it. I must have slept

17:52.612 --> 17:55.655
through it because it sure didn't. I still don't 
remember ever having any training to that type.

18:01.760 --> 18:05.063
Did you have any contact with ARVN? We did some, had 
some operations with the Arvin troops. Of course,

18:11.717 --> 18:15.641
we didn't talk to the, I didn't talk to the Arvin 
troops. I talked to the advisor. The American

18:17.182 --> 18:20.225
advisor was who I'd talk to on the radio.

18:23.809 --> 18:30.576
I can remember one bad experience with them that I 
thought they were a bunch of chickens. In fact,

18:31.757 --> 18:33.058
they were their helicopters came in the area and 
there was some some ground fire going on they just

18:34.540 --> 19:02.995
turned around and left they were supposed to 
resupply their own soldiers and they just fled the

18:34.540 --> 19:02.995
area they didn't even make their drop and i 
remember having to chase them in my aircraft and

18:34.540 --> 19:02.995
actually shoot a burst of minigun across their 
nose to make them turn around and go back and land

18:34.540 --> 19:02.995
and drop their bullets and resupply but that was 
that was a bad experience the The other few times

19:04.544 --> 19:10.589
that I did work with the Arvin soldiers, they 
seemed to do pretty well. They were fighting well,

19:11.370 --> 19:14.573
fighting hard. Just that one incident where they 
appeared to be running rather than fighting. What

19:23.181 --> 19:25.242
did you think of your enemy? When you were there, it 
was pretty much an MPA at the time, more than BC, or

19:26.864 --> 19:31.908
was it? Both. And very resourceful. I've got to 
admire their resourcefulness. They could take

19:40.194 --> 19:47.161
pieces of nothing and make weapons out of them. 
Some of the

19:47.181 --> 20:02.395
devices that they used to set off rockets, a GI 
wristwatch and a battery, put their rockets on

19:47.181 --> 20:02.395
cross dates. They'd use a homemade gunner's 
quadrant to set the launch angle. They'd hook both

20:09.837 --> 20:22.991
wires to the battery, one to the case on the watch, 
and the other, they'd drill a small hole through

20:09.837 --> 20:22.991
the crystal at 12 o'clock. They'd set the watch 
with the long hand at 5 past the hour. And 55 minutes

20:27.977 --> 20:32.922
later, when the long hand contacted the wire, that 
was stuck through the crystal, the rockets would

20:33.560 --> 20:35.762
launch. That gave them almost an hour to get away. 
Very ingenious. Very sneaky. I guess where you

20:45.130 --> 20:51.196
couldn't tell the bad guys from the good guys, it 
helped them. Guerrilla warfare is very effective

20:51.216 --> 20:55.700
in that way. I guess that was a source of 
frustration. Couldn't really tell them who the

20:58.322 --> 21:02.706
bad guys were.

21:02.922 --> 21:15.736
While you were in Vietnam, did you get a lot of

21:02.922 --> 21:15.736
notice about the demonstrations against the war 
back home? Did y'all hear about it while you were in

21:15.756 --> 21:17.517
Vietnam? I get some of it now and then. I guess the 
flower children were, everybody knew about the

21:22.142 --> 21:27.909
flower children and flower power and all of that. 
Personally, I didn't pay much attention to it.

21:33.078 --> 21:37.202
more important things to worry about, namely my 
butt.

21:42.948 --> 21:52.878
If you've seen the movie Good Morning Vietnam, the 
new censorship, I think, portrayed in the movie

21:42.948 --> 21:52.878
was probably a little overboard of what it really 
was. But it wasn't censored that bad. I don't think

21:58.884 --> 22:00.845
it did. Of course, I've got no way of knowing. I was 
there and not here. What did you think about the

22:06.882 --> 22:13.531
protesters when you finished your tour and you 
were back home? They were kind of angry.

22:22.282 --> 22:23.283
I don't think they really knew. A lot of them knew 
what they were protesting about. I think they were

22:26.687 --> 22:28.009
just... like cattle following the leader. Some of 
them knew what they were protesting about, but an

22:31.727 --> 22:36.914
awful lot of them didn't. I guess I kind of blamed 
the press, the media, for a lot. I don't know. After

22:44.844 --> 22:52.575
I got back from Vietnam and had been there, you see 
some of the newscasts. Now, I know it really didn't

22:53.816 --> 22:57.321
happen the way they're portraying it. I think 
sometimes they were very negative against our

22:57.740 --> 23:02.205
being there. They would take the opportunity to 
distort a story a little bit to maybe keep the

23:02.986 --> 23:15.661
American people upset about it, I guess. So do you 
believe the press should have been held back from,

23:16.262 --> 23:26.734
or should have been somewhat censored by the Army 
No, I don't think you can do that and have freedom of

23:27.507 --> 23:31.413
the press. I think the press and the media need to be 
there, but they need to, I don't know if you can do

23:32.695 --> 23:48.359
that or not, if there is such a thing as having a 
neutral view rather than a hawkish or dovish. If

23:50.482 --> 23:56.451
they just wouldn't put their own opinions into it 
all the time, I think, if the correspondent

23:50.482 --> 23:56.451
wouldn't strictly write his stories from his 
viewpoint. What was your opinion on the draft?

24:04.087 --> 24:08.071
Well, I enlisted to beat the draft. I

24:08.652 --> 24:24.531
think that the value of the draft became more 
evident later on in my honorary career when I

24:08.652 --> 24:24.531
commanded a basic training company, right at the 
change from a draft to an all-volunteer. I saw just

24:25.439 --> 24:27.541
one example. I saw the average education level of a 
class of trainees, a company of trainees, 225

24:28.342 --> 24:34.670
trainees. The average education level go from 14 
years to nine years within just a couple cycles. So

24:42.378 --> 24:50.468
I think as a draft, with the draft, you get a better 
cross-section of the people in the United States

24:42.378 --> 24:50.468
than you do with an all-volunteer.

24:53.831 --> 24:55.193
Do you have an opinion about those men that decided 
to join the National Guard or to go to Canada? Well,

25:04.584 --> 25:06.586
I think that's two separate issues. As far as 
joining the National Guard or Reserves, I had the

25:08.247 --> 25:12.131
same opportunity.

25:16.594 --> 25:17.075
I could have. In fact, the day that I heard about the 
Warrant Officer Flight Program on the radio, I had

25:17.575 --> 25:25.602
just come from an interview with the Reserves, the 
Army Reserves. A friend of mine and I had gone for an

25:26.425 --> 25:37.399
interview, and I heard about the Warrant Officer 
Flight Program. He went on and joined the

25:38.281 --> 25:42.025
Reserves, and I came on active duty. He's still in 
the Reserves, and I'm retired. There were

25:47.413 --> 25:51.137
Reserves who served in Vietnam and National 
Guard. So, yeah, they, you know, Some people

25:55.535 --> 26:02.282
perceived it as an out, something to do to escape 
having to go to Vietnam. I had the same opportunity

26:03.503 --> 26:05.526
and didn't take it. But do you have an opinion about 
those who went to Canada? Yeah, I have a definite

26:12.673 --> 26:19.160
opinion about those cowardly SOBs. Okay.

26:22.724 --> 26:23.905
They shouldn't let them back in the country. Do

26:26.062 --> 26:35.254
you

26:26.062 --> 26:35.254
believe the U.S. could have won the war? Yes. Yes. 
And why? Well, first off, I think the commanders

26:41.182 --> 26:50.013
over there were too hamstrung by the politicians.

26:52.576 --> 26:53.858
I think if... Goals could have been established, 
definite goals that were supportable by the

26:55.492 --> 27:02.259
United States government. And if they had just 
turned the leadership loose over there to conduct

27:02.279 --> 27:17.974
the war the way they knew how,

27:02.279 --> 27:17.974
perhaps we'd have made a little better showing 
over there. I think Congress being what they are, I

27:17.994 --> 27:23.119
think They hamstrung us too much, and I think there 
were a lot of lives lost needlessly. It would not

27:29.410 --> 27:34.938
have been lost if we had given it more commitment as 
a nation. Do you think that if the U.S. would have

27:37.001 --> 27:46.974
declared war, the nation would have been able to 
get behind it more, or do you think it probably

27:37.001 --> 27:46.974
wouldn't have done anything? I guess I might be 
contradicting myself. I don't think the American

27:50.138 --> 27:52.802
people wanted to support a war. At that point in 
time, it probably would have taken something as

27:53.575 --> 28:07.190
drastic as the bombing of Pearl Harbor only here in 
the United States to shake the people loose into

27:53.575 --> 28:07.190
reality. It's

28:09.252 --> 28:20.764
hard to say what it would have taken to get the U.S. 
people behind it, totally committed like they

28:09.252 --> 28:20.764
were in World War II.

28:24.811 --> 28:33.400
If you had to do all over again, would you go back to 
Vietnam, go back to that time, would you?

28:36.764 --> 28:36.984
Yes. Like I said, 21 years in the Army. That's 
really the only, that one year I was doing what I was

28:43.532 --> 28:54.784
trained to do, and that's fight. The rest of the 21 
years, I was either training people to be prepared

28:56.047 --> 29:03.895
or trying to be prepared myself. It's easier to 
fight the peacetime moment.
