WEBVTT

00:02.967 --> 00:19.690
individuals, friends, and or faculty that were 
notable in your student days that if they were

00:02.967 --> 00:19.690
right here that you'd want to pat them on the back 
and thank them? A lot of them, yes. Who were they?

00:23.735 --> 00:25.417
The names I told you earlier. All right. What about 
some, were there some close buddies? Yeah. I

00:31.908 --> 00:34.632
suspect I was very close to my roommate in college.

00:37.637 --> 00:40.481
I told him the name of Harry Cordua. Spell that. 
C-O-R-D-U-A.

00:46.530 --> 00:58.388
He was

00:46.530 --> 00:58.388
reared in Nicaragua, but he had American 
citizenship.

00:59.971 --> 01:03.536
He was in Nicaragua when the Sandinistas killed 
him.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.865
Now, how was he accepted as a student by the other 
students here? Well, he had certain personality

01:11.006 --> 01:26.027
traits that sort of came through, and as a result 
they accepted him, but he was never in a really

01:11.006 --> 01:26.027
pushy, outgoing situation. He struggled in his 
coursework somewhat. He was not really the

01:29.401 --> 01:32.045
military type.

01:37.011 --> 01:41.538
He never finished with OCS.

01:43.340 --> 01:58.581
Let's make believe that someone today gave you a 
check for a million dollars and there was only one

01:43.340 --> 01:58.581
restriction on it that you had to pass it on to Texas 
A&M but you could decide the use of the million

01:43.340 --> 01:58.581
dollars. What would you have A&M do with your gift 
of a million dollars?

02:05.293 --> 02:06.394
Now you're bringing me up to date.

02:11.338 --> 02:17.784
I think

02:11.338 --> 02:17.784
that I would give a million dollars. I would like to 
see something in terms of the social sciences, not

02:19.845 --> 02:27.572
economics, not business. more in the area of 
philosophy, history, and that might be ingrained

02:28.733 --> 02:40.620
into the College of Agriculture and Life 
Sciences, and find some way to do that. Now, that

02:42.725 --> 02:46.995
probably means a chair.

02:50.857 --> 02:52.479
Does anybody else do that now? Any other ag school 
that you know of? Anybody? There are faculty

02:58.247 --> 03:06.478
members who are in

02:58.247 --> 03:06.478
positions of colleges of agriculture. We had Paul 
Thompson. Lost him because... But somehow to fix

03:12.627 --> 03:18.535
that thing because... Just when you do it as a dean 
or something else, it becomes, shall we use the

03:18.683 --> 03:25.132
term, ephemeral?

03:29.719 --> 03:33.084
Okay, last question then of this about your 
student days. What feelings do you hold for Texas

03:34.086 --> 03:37.831
A&M in your heart now?

03:41.256 --> 03:46.203
Describe how you feel about A&M.

03:46.223 --> 03:48.066
Well, most of my life has been spent here. I think 
this is a wonderful place. I think it has great

03:53.921 --> 03:55.363
opportunity. I'd like to see its progress.

04:01.674 --> 04:11.050
I have a great deal of affection for this 
university.

04:13.493 --> 04:22.347
I don't use the terminology that a lot of people 
were doing at my age, you know, went through, this

04:13.493 --> 04:22.347
is the greatest place in the whole world. No, it is 
not the greatest place in all the world.

04:28.337 --> 04:39.535
But it is the greatest place, but it has been a place 
that has grown and developed from when I was here,

04:28.337 --> 04:39.535
it was a small undergraduate

04:42.215 --> 04:54.775
program to a major significant factor in the 
economy of this country and in the lives of lots of

04:42.215 --> 04:54.775
people. And it's that growth ability that I've 
seen through the years, the fact that it has

04:57.119 --> 05:07.075
climbed, maybe by its bootstraps, But it's that 
ability that it has, that it's hired people like

05:08.995 --> 05:18.285
Haskell Monroe who left ways of doing it.

05:21.649 --> 05:35.644
I don't know that I'm entirely comfortable with 
the direction it's going, but I have long decided

05:21.649 --> 05:35.644
that my age, the young people of this

05:40.872 --> 05:53.525
just as long as they begin to see

05:40.872 --> 05:53.525
where we can go and what we can do. And it's how do we 
find ways in which

05:53.545 --> 06:07.960
the land grant university is going to be entirely 
different from what it was back then. The

06:09.712 --> 06:18.261
Land-Grant University

06:09.712 --> 06:18.261
has a significant factor was access. Anybody 
could come.

06:22.845 --> 06:29.672
If you could maintain that, it is a significant 
factor of service to people.

06:30.994 --> 06:38.301
But again, I guess it's that good old Aggie 
confidence, self-confidence.

06:39.530 --> 06:52.004
that I see possible here more than any other place 
except the larger, the more prestigious

06:39.530 --> 06:52.004
universities where they have this image and they 
can do this image. Maybe we can build an image at

06:52.725 --> 06:56.349
Texas A&M and do the same thing. I hope the people 
will do it. That's my feeling of Texas A&M.
