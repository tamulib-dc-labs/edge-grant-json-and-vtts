WEBVTT

00:05.482 --> 00:08.926
to probably read my watch better if it were turned 
correctly.

00:16.294 --> 00:20.578
First, I would like for you to explain to me how you 
developed your interest in oceanography.

00:25.423 --> 00:31.810
I developed my interest in oceanography when I was 
a graduate student at MIT.

00:35.232 --> 00:41.602
working across the hall one day from a lecture room 
where Bill Van Arks was giving a lecture. And I

00:43.204 --> 00:45.447
overheard him in the class. I overheard what he was 
talking about in the class. And when the class was

00:48.993 --> 00:55.242
over, I went up to him and I said, what he was talking 
about sounded very interesting. And did he mind if

00:55.362 --> 00:57.706
I sat in on his course? I was too late to register, 
but I'd just like to sit in on it. He said, sure, he'd

01:00.610 --> 01:03.034
be delighted to have me sit in on his course. So I sat 
in on his course. And

01:05.708 --> 01:19.631
that summer he arranged for me to come to the Woods 
Hole Oceanographic Institution as a summer

01:05.708 --> 01:19.631
student fellow, which I did. And I got interested 
in what I was doing, and I'm still here. And here you

01:24.098 --> 01:24.739
are. Yeah. That was 19 years ago. What pursuit were 
you following at MIT? I was in geophysics, but I

01:31.879 --> 01:37.715
thought I was interested in terrestrial 
magnetism. And I was working on a geochronology

01:38.035 --> 01:43.731
project dating the age of the Earth. wasn't 
finding that as interesting as it ought to be. The

01:46.760 --> 01:51.246
man I came to work with thought he had a serious 
cancer and was going to die. Happily, he's still

01:51.346 --> 01:52.848
alive and kicking. But I came all the way here to MIT 
to be his graduate student. He thought he was dying

01:59.177 --> 02:03.122
of cancer and so handed all his students over to 
somebody else. So I was kind of homeless anyway.

02:04.484 --> 02:10.272
And I didn't find the geochronology project, that 
geochronology project, as interesting as I

02:04.484 --> 02:10.272
thought it should have been. Von Arx's class 
sounded very interesting. I haven't regretted

02:12.875 --> 02:14.157
it. With whom did you work when you came here to 
Woods Hole? With Bill Fennarks. And what was your

02:20.490 --> 02:21.731
first project? The first project was one I got 
involved with that summer. I

02:29.299 --> 02:38.489
came here, and Bill Fennarks had forgotten about 
me. He had organized that I should come for the

02:38.609 --> 02:41.832
summer, then he forgot about me. And he went to sea a 
couple days before I arrived. He went to sea for a

02:44.337 --> 02:45.478
month. And he came back at the end of the month and 
said, oh, you, I forgot. And I spent the next three

02:50.003 --> 02:58.492
or four years working on the data from that cruise I 
didn't get to go on, which was kind of dumb all

02:50.003 --> 02:58.492
around when you think about it. But that was my 
thesis. And I worked after, but I got my degree in

03:00.414 --> 03:03.838
the same field for a couple more years. And I 
switched a bit. I felt like I plumbed all I could of

03:05.760 --> 03:08.823
that for a while. And I changed other things. Okay. 
First, what were you working on? Oh, what was I

03:12.413 --> 03:13.614
working on? Okay, fine. I was working on the effect 
of meanders in the Gulf Stream off the coast of the

03:14.395 --> 03:31.870
Carolinas and trying to understand what their 
properties were and what their dynamic effect

03:14.395 --> 03:31.870
was. And I was able to show that they had a role in 
transferring They had a major role, I think, in

03:40.165 --> 03:50.816
transferring energy

03:40.165 --> 03:50.816
from the density field of the ocean into the Gulf 
Stream. And I worked on that for a number of years,

03:52.678 --> 03:56.322
wrote a number of papers on it. They're in the 
literature.

04:01.888 --> 04:05.072
In the early 60s, I became more intrigued. In fact, 
in the course of some of my Gulf Stream work, I put

04:08.347 --> 04:17.056
out deep-sea moorings with instruments that 
recorded, and then you go back after a few months

04:08.347 --> 04:17.056
and cover the instruments. In fact, I think I may 
have been the first person ever to write a paper on

04:18.217 --> 04:26.326
doing that kind of thing, at least the way we do it 
now. And using the data, there were lots of papers

04:27.887 --> 04:36.797
saying what we should do and what we will do, but 
nobody really went out and got the data and

04:27.887 --> 04:36.797
analyzed the data. And I think I was the first 
person did do that of this kind. And I got more

04:41.912 --> 04:46.879
interested, and I thought that it was clear that in 
the future there would be a big effort in doing

04:41.912 --> 04:46.879
this. And so I devoted a number of years to trying to 
build up a group to put out deep sea moorings and

04:47.440 --> 04:56.912
collect data with them from independent 
instruments. And that project's going right now.

04:58.474 --> 05:00.377
It's the largest project in this institution. 
It's been going for, well, I got involved in about

05:00.997 --> 05:05.944
62. And it's been going since then. I was one of the 
people who really made it. I

05:11.515 --> 05:19.803
got out of it four or five years ago when I got into 
more administrative tasks. I still keep my hand in

05:19.823 --> 05:25.829
on it, but I don't work on it scientifically in the 
sense of publishing papers. Did you ever teach

05:28.191 --> 05:29.653
here at Woods Hole? No. Oh, let's see. I've got to be 
careful to answer that one. Yes, I taught. I taught

05:37.476 --> 05:38.538
at MIT. It was a while in the late 60s before Woods 
Hole started its educational program, where we

05:38.658 --> 05:49.436
had an arrangement whereby people on the staff 
here were given appointments on the staff at MIT.

05:49.456 --> 05:55.847
So I was given an appointment at MIT in the 
Department of Earth, and I was called in. Today

05:55.887 --> 05:57.971
it's called Earth and Planetary Sciences. Then it 
was called Earth Sciences, I think. And I was given

06:00.954 --> 06:04.177
an appointment as an assistant professor in the 
Earth Sciences Department. I taught there in

06:04.718 --> 06:09.603
1964,

06:04.718 --> 06:09.603
perhaps. I can't remember the year now. And then I 
taught again the second time in 67. In 67, I gave

06:13.647 --> 06:17.530
classes here, but it was still an MIT course. After 
that, I didn't. That was shortly about that time

06:19.412 --> 06:24.457
Woods Hole developed its own program, and those 
joint appointments were abolished. But there

06:25.058 --> 06:28.581
were four or five of us here in the staff who had 
joint appointments with MIT. Did you always feel

06:29.101 --> 06:33.387
as if your career was aimed towards research 
rather than teaching? Yes.

06:41.779 --> 06:56.020
Do you think that the primary purpose of an 
institution like, let's say, Scripps and Woods

06:41.779 --> 06:56.020
Hole, which in this case are unique, are primarily 
designed for research and teaching, and is that a

06:41.779 --> 06:56.020
good thing for oceanography? I'm not quite sure I 
understand your question. Are they primarily

06:57.905 --> 06:59.447
designed for research? They are primarily 
designed for research. Yes. Oh, OK. And do you

07:01.389 --> 07:04.273
think that's essentially a good thing for 
oceanography? Do you think this is the sort of role

07:04.293 --> 07:07.957
that large institutions should have? As opposed 
to? As opposed to being both teaching and research

07:08.558 --> 07:11.081
institutions. Oh, no. We are a teaching and 
research institution here. And teaching is an

07:14.045 --> 07:16.227
integral part. We have 80 graduate students going 
for their PhD here. This is the largest, maybe the

07:18.490 --> 07:23.917
largest collection of people going for their PhD 
in oceanography in the world right here. So we

07:23.957 --> 07:24.758
can't. We're heavily involved with teaching. But 
that's a fairly late development. It's late in

07:29.585 --> 07:31.027
terms of my own career. I got involved about the 
time that our teaching program really got off the

07:31.708 --> 07:38.378
ground here. I began to get involved with other 
things. I went away for a year's sabbatical about

07:40.320 --> 07:42.584
that time. I was involved in the early days. I was a 
member of the first committee that was organized

07:45.809 --> 07:53.580
to develop the joint program we have right now with 
MIT. And that was after I'd been a teacher. Yeah,

07:56.833 --> 08:00.944
I'm not being very articulate about this, which is 
unfortunate. But it seems almost as if Woods Hole

08:00.964 --> 08:07.300
itself is, in effect, a latecomer to the teaching 
of oceanography. In a formal sense, that's quite

08:08.630 --> 08:11.134
true. But remember, I got my PhD years before we had 
a program here, and I was a student at MIT, and the

08:11.274 --> 08:18.284
doors were open here, and I came and did my thesis. I 
think if you look back at the people who first

08:18.724 --> 08:30.141
started here, you'll find people way back in the 
early 30s who were, say, students at Harvard or

08:18.724 --> 08:30.141
whatever, and got their theses at Harvard or 
wherever as a result of research work done here. It

08:30.641 --> 08:35.228
wasn't until 10 years ago that this institution 
got the authority to put its own name on a

08:36.001 --> 08:37.443
sheepskin. And since that time, our program has 
grown a great deal. And it's a good program. All

08:41.167 --> 08:41.488
right. And I take it then from the quality of your 
answers that you're excited about the idea of

08:41.648 --> 08:49.458
bringing students into .. It's essential. 
There's no question about it. You can't. We

08:53.743 --> 08:54.144
couldn't. It's just a question of the maturity of 
this particular institution and perhaps a little

08:54.845 --> 08:59.791
bit of the field. But no, we would be a much more 
sterile place if we didn't have that. No question.

09:06.207 --> 09:16.036
Now, as you begin to design the institution to 
bring in formal students here, rather than a

09:06.207 --> 09:16.036
working relationship with MIT, what was your 
reaction to faculty? What was your reaction? How

09:18.358 --> 09:19.319
did you design it? What did you think about when you 
began to think about bringing in formal students?

09:23.203 --> 09:25.004
What sort of students did you want? What did you 
want them to do? In other words, describe for me the

09:26.386 --> 09:30.930
sort of thought processes that seem to go through 
here. I don't think there was much I don't think

09:35.148 --> 09:41.735
there was much of a problem along the lines you're 
suggesting, because we kind of slid into it. We had

09:41.775 --> 09:44.098
this program going already with MIT. We had had 
students for years around the institution, not

09:44.578 --> 09:52.607
just from MIT, but from other labs, other 
universities as well. And so when the time came to

09:53.228 --> 10:03.940
make the formal thing, and we signed an agreement 
with MIT, a formal education in oceanography so

09:53.228 --> 10:03.940
that all students in both institutions would be 
jointly registered, We just took the status quo,

10:04.274 --> 10:08.821
and there were already up at MIT several dozen 
students. They automatically became joint

10:09.202 --> 10:13.168
students if they wanted to. There was a 
grandfather clause. Any student who didn't want

10:14.751 --> 10:18.417
to become a Woods Hole student was MIT alone. And 
about half the students decided they wanted to

10:18.998 --> 10:22.183
jointly, and about half decided they didn't. But 
after that point, they were all admitted jointly.

10:24.647 --> 10:28.453
We had a well-entrenched faculty. We had a 
well-qualified faculty here. We don't use the

10:31.240 --> 10:33.303
word faculty, we say staff. We had a 
well-qualified staff here. We didn't have any

10:35.665 --> 10:39.811
trouble finding people to serve on admissions 
committees, to serve on thesis committees. We

10:39.831 --> 10:41.032
walked right into it. A good number of the younger 
men in the institution, though not the older ones,

10:41.753 --> 10:49.723
had taught elsewhere, and so they knew what they 
wanted to do. The old-timers had been here since

10:49.983 --> 10:58.334
the 30s, and they had a different outlook on 
things, but the younger ones, they thought

10:49.983 --> 10:58.334
teaching was a routine part of life. We went into a 
fairly... There were some pains, but they were the

11:01.075 --> 11:05.300
kind of administrative pains involved with 
everything. And I think looking back at it, what we

11:05.340 --> 11:16.113
did was inevitable, and it's hard to imagine that 
we wouldn't have students now. We would have a very

11:17.034 --> 11:19.197
bad problem right now if we didn't. People would 
really rise up and say, we've got to get a program if

11:19.738 --> 11:25.885
we didn't have one today.

11:28.345 --> 11:31.188
I don't think we had any problems with curriculum 
because we had worked that out. We had a de facto

11:31.768 --> 11:35.532
curriculum before we had students. We had a de 
facto faculty. I mean, taking a place like this

11:36.973 --> 11:47.083
with the majority of whom wouldn't have any 
trouble getting a job at a university and adding

11:36.973 --> 11:47.083
students to them, you don't have any of the 
problems you might have in trying to create a

11:36.973 --> 11:47.083
university from scratch. Didn't have any 
problems in trying to decide who was a member of the

11:47.784 --> 11:52.328
faculty or what these things were. We still don't 
have much problem because we have so few students

11:52.368 --> 11:57.373
relative to the large size of the research staff 
here. that the ratio is a good one. It's in favor of

12:00.094 --> 12:01.135
the students. There's two or three staff members 
for students still. And the students get lots of

12:04.340 --> 12:05.763
attention. And there's no teaching load 
problems. Those who teach do. Those who don't want

12:07.986 --> 12:10.310
to, there's no heat on them. So it works out easily. 
So there was not any internal problems or external

12:11.872 --> 12:16.459
problems in making a transition? Oh no, there were 
internal problems. There were strains. There

12:19.550 --> 12:24.380
were a lot of people who said, I came to Woods Hole 
because it wasn't a teaching institution and I

12:19.550 --> 12:24.380
don't want to teach. And those people, some of 
those people never have taught, never will, and

12:24.520 --> 12:29.129
there's no heat on them too. A few other people who 
said that, when the students got here, they

12:29.891 --> 12:38.228
realized they were missing a good thing, and some 
of them are staunch members of the teaching thing

12:29.891 --> 12:38.228
right now. But as I say, because we have such a large 
staff and such a large number of students,

12:38.579 --> 12:49.370
particularly a small number of students, 
particularly at the beginning, we didn't have any

12:38.579 --> 12:49.370
problem in meeting our requirements to handle the 
students.

12:53.074 --> 12:57.678
In terms of placing students, have you had any 
problem? No. Every student we've ever turned

13:00.261 --> 13:02.283
out's got a job. And

13:03.664 --> 13:08.569
I don't think all our students have the job they It 
would be wrong to say all our students got the first

13:08.819 --> 13:13.184
job they wanted if they were able to write a 
prescription. They might say, we all want to be a

13:13.264 --> 13:19.011
professor at Harvard, and maybe only one or two are 
professors at Harvard. On the other hand, I don't

13:19.291 --> 13:20.933
think there are any. We haven't had a problem of 
producing more students than we can get jobs for.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.682
Everyone has had a job, and all of them have been 
pretty good jobs. They've all been in the field one

13:28.702 --> 13:30.844
way or another. If you were going to offer 
recommendations to an undergraduate student who

13:31.702 --> 13:41.112
wanted to do graduate work at Woods Hole, how would 
you tell him to organize his academic studies? I

13:41.432 --> 13:44.876
would say, well, it would depend on the field he was 
in. We're covering all the various disciplines of

13:46.878 --> 13:50.862
oceanography. Here we call it biology, 
biological oceanography, chemical

13:51.062 --> 13:58.850
oceanography, marine geology and geophysics, 
physical oceanography and ocean engineering.

13:58.910 --> 14:00.612
Each one of those. disciplines has a different 
curriculum which would lead into it. Physical

14:06.118 --> 14:07.579
oceanography is my specialty. And physical 
oceanography, I would say, don't muck around with

14:08.120 --> 14:14.728
any oceanography courses in undergraduate. 
Study mathematics, study physics, get a good

14:14.748 --> 14:17.792
grounding in the basics. Come here with a good 
grounding in the basics, and you can do anything

14:18.192 --> 14:20.675
you want. OK. And so I infer from that that you think 
that probably schools which give general

14:22.698 --> 14:31.408
undergraduate oceanography degrees don't do the 
sort of work to produce the kind of graduate

14:31.861 --> 14:38.209
student who would come here for the scripts. 
That's generally correct. I don't know about

14:39.250 --> 14:40.051
scripts. I can't speak for that. But I know from our 
curriculum we've had very few people come here

14:41.493 --> 14:52.927
who've, if any, ever, I don't know, can't think of 
one offhand, but we may have, that have come with an

14:41.493 --> 14:52.927
undergraduate degree in oceanography. And even 
the people who've taken option courses, whatever

14:53.328 --> 15:00.737
you call them, in oceanography, it hasn't done 
them much good because really the Proper

15:01.156 --> 15:05.662
oceanography is a pretty rigorous field, and you 
need to have the basics to make much progress in it.

15:06.262 --> 15:15.554
The best students we get are, let's say, in 
physical oceanography, some of the best students

15:06.262 --> 15:15.554
have been applied mathematicians of various 
mathematical types, physical types, chemistry

15:06.262 --> 15:15.554
types. No ocean bias at all in terms of their 
undergraduate curriculum. I feel quite strongly

15:21.541 --> 15:23.704
that that's the best way to do it. Otherwise, you 
just dilute yourself in obtaining the

15:24.044 --> 15:30.572
intellectual tools you have to have. Are your 
students nationally, in terms of margin? Yes.

15:35.312 --> 15:35.913
International. International, in terms of 
margin.

15:40.443 --> 15:46.134
Do you foresee or would you predict more 
international students coming into Scripps now

15:40.443 --> 15:46.134
that, for example? You mean Woods Hall? I'm sorry. 
At Woods Hole, I was comparing you to Scripps

15:48.457 --> 15:52.462
mentally as I went through here. Well, since I said 
Scripps, it's OK. It seems to me that at Scripps

15:55.345 --> 16:08.681
that now people are talking about 250-mile 
research lines, international law, and so forth,

15:55.345 --> 16:08.681
that there's almost a deliberate attempt to 
create more international cooperation and to

15:55.345 --> 16:08.681
attract more students. Yes, that's right. And do 
you think the same thing is happening here at Woods

16:09.882 --> 16:12.085
Hole? There will be more effort to do that, but 
there's also a feeling here that we won't

16:13.010 --> 16:27.529
compromise our standards on quality, and that we 
may try and set up some kinds of special programs,

16:13.010 --> 16:27.529
not related to, but not part of our normal 
degree-granting program to accommodate foreign

16:13.010 --> 16:27.529
students. Yes, it's going to be necessary to do 
that. In some cases, in countries we want to work in

16:29.611 --> 16:36.881
collaboration with, we're going to have to, as 
kind of a quid pro quo, accommodate their

16:29.611 --> 16:36.881
students. And we recognize that, and the staff 
here is working on it. As both an administrator and

16:40.955 --> 16:49.083
as a practicing oceanographer, do you feel uneasy 
about the changes in international law? Do you

16:49.463 --> 16:52.907
feel it's going to limit your chances to do your 
science? No, there's no question it's going to

16:54.088 --> 16:57.992
limit our chances to do science, and naturally I'm 
uneasy about it. It's a reflection of the

16:58.673 --> 17:01.455
international situation in the world today. The 
United States is one of the half countries, and we

17:01.475 --> 17:08.262
like to be able to do things our way, and there's a 
number of A lot of countries out there in the world,

17:08.883 --> 17:17.591
the majority of them I think is honest, more than 
the majority, are determined that we shall not be

17:08.883 --> 17:17.591
the king of the cock of the walk, king of the roost, 
whatever. And it's going to hurt oceanography a

17:18.351 --> 17:20.633
great deal. It's going to limit us tremendously. 
It's going to make work more expensive. It's going

17:24.356 --> 17:26.578
to make it impossible in some cases. It's going to 
make it aggravating, irritating, frustrating,

17:26.919 --> 17:29.621
whatever. And there's no question it's going to 
have a very serious negative effect on our freedom

17:30.422 --> 17:37.708
to do things. It hasn't hit us yet, but it will. Do 
you foresee, then, more, let's say, cooperative

17:40.857 --> 17:45.062
projects between yourself and, let's say, Chile? 
Certainly, yeah. We have that now, and that kind of

17:46.984 --> 17:49.407
thing will work. We have cooperative progress 
with Chile. We have cooperative projects

17:51.770 --> 17:57.176
underway right now in this institution with 
several countries around the world. And this will

17:58.618 --> 17:59.780
continue. I could name 20 countries I think we're 
working collaboratively with. That will just

18:03.003 --> 18:04.285
have to increase. How do you make contact with 
those countries? The most effective normal way is

18:08.030 --> 18:11.976
to work with scientists in those other countries. 
If you write to the Foreign Office of Zambia,

18:14.119 --> 18:18.486
you're not even going to get an answer to your 
letter. If you write to Professor so-and-so at

18:18.866 --> 18:32.446
some university in Zambia whom you happen to have 
met at a meeting somewhere, you may get

18:18.866 --> 18:32.446
overwhelmed by hospitality, and you'll get not 
only a permission, but you may even get

18:18.866 --> 18:32.446
assistance. This has happened to us. Some of our 
scientists have really done a nice job. for

18:36.700 --> 18:42.149
example, in Indonesia or maybe Zambia, many of 
these countries where we've been able to do

18:36.700 --> 18:42.149
things. Woods Hole should have a tremendous 
advantage with the size of your fleet in making

18:42.590 --> 18:47.237
contacts there. Well, it's an advantage and a 
disadvantage. We have a large fleet, but, of

18:48.820 --> 18:58.576
course, that multiplies the number of times we 
make contacts with the people, so it makes it work

18:48.820 --> 18:58.576
even harder to keep abreast of the law of the sea 
problems.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.843
Why did you choose to become an administrator?

19:07.328 --> 19:13.255
The opportunity was there, first of all, partly 
because I found I was skilled at it. I became the

19:13.275 --> 19:22.565
chairman of the physical oceanography 
department a few years back, and that seemed to be,

19:13.275 --> 19:22.565
at the time, a natural thing to do. And in so doing, I 
was able to keep on with research and

19:22.805 --> 19:31.615
administration both, because the job was not too 
much of a chore. Then the opportunity came along to

19:33.046 --> 19:36.310
become the associate director of the 
institution. That was more of a hard decision, but

19:36.330 --> 19:41.936
I thought I can always back off, and it may be worth a 
try. I'll try it for a while and see whether I like it

19:41.956 --> 19:43.958
or not. So I did. And do you like it? Not every day. 
Who does? This is maybe one of those days. The

19:55.270 --> 19:58.514
question is, those days, yeah, there has to be some 
fun in them. There is some fun. It's nice to be able

19:59.355 --> 20:01.517
to be... has to be able to influence things your 
way. It's nice to be able to work with a lab where you

20:06.093 --> 20:11.599
respect the people and their abilities. That's 
some reward. It's nice to be able to do that. On the

20:14.483 --> 20:18.708
other hand, there are times when those very things 
are things that drive you up the wall. It depends

20:19.809 --> 20:22.092
when you catch me. What sort of new ideas did you try 
to bring in as associate director?

20:31.872 --> 20:36.076
That's a hard question, because I don't know that 
I'm not sure I brought in this. I'm not sure that I

20:36.236 --> 20:39.259
have consciously been bringing in new ideas. 
Maybe that's a bad thing to say, but I can't say

20:39.319 --> 20:42.963
that. I think that one of the things I felt most 
strongly that was my task to try and do was trying to

20:44.144 --> 21:00.580
make the institution more open in its 
relationship to the staff, the faculty, and try

20:44.144 --> 21:00.580
and make it a more effective place for them to do 
their work. I think with a relatively small

21:01.319 --> 21:08.851
institution, the institution is both big and 
small, depending on which way you're looking at

21:01.319 --> 21:08.851
it. Compared to a university, it's small. 
Compared to oceanographic labs, it's big. But in

21:13.478 --> 21:20.249
the small sense of it, you'd like to have it as most 
flexibility there is for the scientists in the

21:13.478 --> 21:20.249
institution. And you'd like to... You can't tell 
them what to do, really, because they know more

21:23.290 --> 21:27.656
about what the science is than I do. I can only be in a 
position, from my experience, to try and set

21:27.696 --> 21:32.702
things up so it's more easy for them to do things. 
And a few times I've been successful at that, and a

21:33.643 --> 21:39.871
few times I'm sure people around here would say 
that I was part of the problem, not part of the

21:33.643 --> 21:39.871
solution. It's hard. You have to do what you think 
is right, and a few times I've had to be negative to

21:43.816 --> 21:50.985
people for reasons that I thought were justified. 
that we've had growing pains in this institution

21:52.906 --> 22:21.411
as it's gotten bigger and it's getting more 
impersonal naturally and i felt one of the most

21:52.906 --> 22:21.411
important things i could do was trying to make the 
system more responsive to the peculiar needs of

21:52.906 --> 22:21.411
any any assigned individual involved with 
science you have to be able to maintain that

21:52.906 --> 22:21.411
flexibility that you had when you were small 
that's hard what about faculty relationships or

21:52.906 --> 22:21.411
staff relationships uh as it's as it's grown as the 
number of your staff members has increased.

22:25.493 --> 22:28.316
Clearly, the sort of exchange among them will 
decrease. I think that's true of any academic

22:28.336 --> 22:30.718
institution. The exchange per person? Per 
person, yes, in terms of the total. Yeah, OK. Is

22:34.661 --> 22:37.604
there any way you've tried to correct that? Does it 
seem correctable? Or do you think this is just sort

22:39.005 --> 22:48.794
of the nature of a modern academic institution?

22:48.814 --> 22:50.115
I'm not sure that.

22:52.795 --> 22:59.422
Interactions between scientists, oh, we've done 
some things, I've done some things to try and

22:52.795 --> 22:59.422
increase that. I haven't made a very strong effort 
on it. I'm not really sure we've got yet to the size

23:03.426 --> 23:07.811
where that's really that serious a problem. We 
have a tendency, there's a kind of a tribal

23:07.831 --> 23:16.120
tendency in the institution for people to work 
only within their own department, and actually

23:07.831 --> 23:16.120
the department's typically have, let's say, 25 
faculty members, and that's probably small

23:16.640 --> 23:21.927
enough for them to talk to each other within as 
much. The bigger problem comes between

23:22.228 --> 23:27.936
departments, and sometimes I've been helpful in 
getting people together between departments. So

23:27.956 --> 23:33.264
I haven't had a conscious banner-waving crusade 
to try and get people to talk together more. The

23:33.304 --> 23:41.415
institution itself has taken steps to try and get 
this through more kinds of committees and

23:33.304 --> 23:41.415
meetings and things to try and encourage people to 
talk. When it all comes down to it, there's a limit

23:41.918 --> 23:45.242
to how much of that you can do and get your work done. 
You've got to go back to your office or your lab and

23:45.262 --> 23:49.967
do your own work a fair amount of the time. You can't 
spend all your time communicating. But you've got

23:51.549 --> 23:56.714
to communicate enough so there's no 
misunderstandings and so people don't work

23:51.549 --> 23:56.714
across purposes. And that's really perhaps where 
I sit above the department chairman. I have a

24:00.459 --> 24:08.748
chance to see when those opportunities are there 
to try and keep people from doing things across

24:00.459 --> 24:08.748
purposes or when they know what things should be 
going on. Ship time. Is there any problem?

24:14.943 --> 24:20.070
The ships are a serious problem, because it's a big 
part of our work here. We've got three large ships

24:20.111 --> 24:29.184
and a submarine, and trying to decide on 
priorities of who gets the ship when are a problem.

24:30.546 --> 24:31.848
Trying to fund them is a problem. They run several 
million dollars a year, which it hasn't been

24:32.969 --> 24:38.938
always obvious every year that we find enough 
money to make the books balance. But we haven't

24:39.639 --> 24:43.785
gone bankrupt, so we have, but it's required a lot 
of attention. also hard deciding how to decide

24:44.390 --> 25:10.245
what you want to do if three people want to go and 
work in the Pacific and three people want to go and

24:44.390 --> 25:10.245
work in the Atlantic and you only have one 
uncommitted ship at that point how do you decide

24:44.390 --> 25:10.245
which group which group of people are going to make 
up the crews these are things that I've been

24:44.390 --> 25:10.245
involved with all right that anticipates really 
the questions I want to ask in two parts first part

24:44.390 --> 25:10.245
is how do you make a decision on who takes the ship or 
doesn't take the ship So we've tried to do it as much

25:12.554 --> 25:28.214
as we could by trying to develop overall lines of 
priority and saying, okay, this year we have X ship

25:12.554 --> 25:28.214
days and we have a long-term commitment to a 
certain program, which means this ship has to stay

25:12.554 --> 25:28.214
in the North Atlantic. We have another long-term 
commitment of some kind, which means another ship

25:28.234 --> 25:32.859
has to be in the Mediterranean. We've got a third 
ship free and we've got commitments that's – we've

25:32.899 --> 25:35.743
got – desire to be in the Pacific and the Indian 
Ocean, let's say. We'll try and see if we have more

25:40.926 --> 25:49.294
people want to go to one than the other, so the one 
with the least number of people can be put off

25:40.926 --> 25:49.294
another year and try and build up a little more 
strength, as an example. These are all kind of

25:49.696 --> 25:51.218
common sense things. And then we have a 
head-to-head conflict. We'd have to resolve it by

25:53.242 --> 26:00.974
trying to look at it from an institution point of 
view and based on its scientific merit. And that's

26:01.595 --> 26:06.502
difficult because you can't say biology is better 
than physical oceanography necessarily. But you

26:07.183 --> 26:08.085
do it. Usually there's some other factors that you 
throw into the balance that make the difference.

26:14.519 --> 26:26.201
And we usually, final decisions like this are 
decided in this institution by what we call staff

26:14.519 --> 26:26.201
council of the various department chairmen and 
the directors getting together and deciding,

26:14.519 --> 26:26.201
okay, we've got a head-to-head problem here. We 
only have one ship and two people who want it, and

26:26.221 --> 26:30.149
therefore it'll go to so-and-so. Our SIP 
schedules are made typically 18 months ahead of

26:30.710 --> 26:34.958
time, so there's usually a lot of time for If we make 
a bad decision, there's a lot of time for people to

26:35.326 --> 26:40.656
protest and get things straightened out. And 
until the day the ship sails, usually we're never

26:40.676 --> 26:44.843
exactly sure of the ship's schedule. But you can 
see on the wall there our schedules for 77, 78.

26:48.991 --> 26:50.473
We'll start in right now on 79. And then, oh, in a 
couple of months, I'll sound a memo to people

26:50.514 --> 26:59.089
saying, we'd like to have a written input from you 
on what your major is. requirements are for ships

26:59.474 --> 27:00.896
in 1979. We'll only have one great big bash of a 
meeting in a meeting room, and everybody will

27:00.916 --> 27:10.847
stand up and say, well, I want to use that ship for 
eight weeks here, and somebody else says, I want to

27:00.916 --> 27:10.847
use it for 12 weeks here, and so forth. We'll put 
them all together. If it solves, if we put them all

27:11.768 --> 27:16.934
end to end, and we've got four ships or whatever, 
and they all solve, fine. Our experience has been

27:17.395 --> 27:21.760
we usually got one and a half times as many requests 
as we have ship days. Then we have a problem. We know

27:25.259 --> 27:32.009
from experience that we don't get enough money 
from the funding agencies in Washington to

27:25.259 --> 27:32.009
support one and a half times as many ship days. We 
know the problem is going to be self-regulating.

27:34.253 --> 27:44.688
The question is where is that we're likely... Can 
we anticipate which programs would like to fall

27:34.253 --> 27:44.688
out because they're not yet well enough to find, 
which is usually the case, why things fall out. Not

27:44.789 --> 27:50.257
because they're bad, but people haven't got their 
ducks in order yet and their program doesn't quite

27:44.789 --> 27:50.257
work. And... We cast out the programs we think are 
weak if we can identify them. By hook or by crook, we

27:56.445 --> 27:58.047
usually get it down. It's not a process which 
can... It's not a linear process, the one that we

28:00.431 --> 28:12.808
can say, well, here's a formula for how we do it, 
because it interacts with the scientists, groups

28:00.431 --> 28:12.808
of scientists, with the funding agencies, and 
with our hardware, with the ships themselves. We

28:13.689 --> 28:19.718
don't want to send... Because of the crew morale, 
we've got a ship right now which is in the... Let's

28:20.930 --> 28:21.351
see. We just got one. I'm sorry. We got one back just 
a few months ago from the Indian Ocean. It had been

28:25.658 --> 28:26.820
away 22 months. We're not going to send it again on 
another 22-month cruise for quite a while. It's

28:31.187 --> 28:32.710
not fair to the crew members. So that ship is ruled 
out for going on the next large cruise. Our next

28:36.476 --> 28:40.343
large cruise is going to be in 1978 when we send that 
ship into the Pacific. It'll be off a different

28:40.363 --> 28:45.611
ship than we sent to the Indian Ocean simply 
because of the morale of the crew. We just can't do

28:45.631 --> 28:46.633
that to them. We've got all kinds of constraints. 
There's so many constraints that go on and on. I'm

28:50.704 --> 28:51.886
not sure it's very interesting. Just use common 
sense to solve it. You have to go through one by one

28:55.111 --> 28:57.876
all these problems. Do you feel that all your 
students should go to C? I think our students

29:02.585 --> 29:05.871
mostly all do go to C. It depends on the student. We 
have a few students who are working on problems

29:05.891 --> 29:11.220
which involves a computer, for example, doing 
numerical modeling or something. They can do

29:11.622 --> 29:18.373
perfectly well if they never go to sea, although 
even in those cases, we generally encourage them

29:11.622 --> 29:18.373
to go to sea. I don't think we've turned out 
students recently who haven't been at least once

29:19.855 --> 29:24.142
to see what it's like. Some people go to sea, and 
they just go for months and months, and they're

29:24.883 --> 29:29.631
chief scientists and run things and everything 
else. That's the other extreme. I don't know why

29:32.235 --> 29:36.241
you picked on students. Why didn't you say, should 
our staff go to sea? Because I was thinking in terms

29:39.567 --> 29:42.210
of the planning program. I assume most of your 
staff at one time or another has been to sea. Oh, no.

29:45.853 --> 29:48.115
We've got staff here who have never been to sea in 
their life. They've been here their whole career

29:48.135 --> 29:49.737
here. And the day they retire, they'll never have 
been to sea. Stonewall was telling me that he

29:52.640 --> 29:56.964
wished he had gone to sea more, but his work had 
never really let him do so. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't.

30:00.868 --> 30:03.690
Well, he goes to sea a fair amount compared with 
some. There are people in this lab who have never

30:04.311 --> 30:08.595
been to sea in their life, and they're good, 
productive oceanographers. Good. They're

30:10.358 --> 30:21.435
working in a laboratory studying specimens 
somebody else brings back, or they're working in

30:10.358 --> 30:21.435
an office with a computer and a slide rule doing 
theoretical studies or something like that, or

30:10.358 --> 30:21.435
studying something that doesn't require them to 
go to sea. For some, doing modeling, they don't

30:21.455 --> 30:24.159
have to go to sea. They haven't. And there are few, 
but there are some. I think the students are the

30:28.465 --> 30:30.128
same as everybody else. There's a cross-section 
of them. Although you might argue that part of the

30:31.730 --> 30:36.878
educational process would be at least one trip to 
sea to find out what they're talking about.

30:38.191 --> 30:47.022
There's been some complaint among older 
oceanographers that younger oceanographers

30:38.191 --> 30:47.022
don't go to sea often enough, don't get their feet 
wet, is usually what they say. Yeah, I heard it. I

30:49.385 --> 30:50.526
agree that they say that. It's the old Iron Man, 
Wooden Chip Syndrome. Oceanography's going

30:55.373 --> 31:00.018
through a hero phase back in the early days, and the 
old-timers still feel it. I'm not sure it's

31:00.559 --> 31:02.882
necessary to be a hero to be a good scientist.
