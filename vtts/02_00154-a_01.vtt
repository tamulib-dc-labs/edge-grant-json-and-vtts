WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:06.034
For 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1. Now we go on to the next 
part, next part, see what happens, see what

00:08.136 --> 00:15.746
happens, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:18.169 --> 00:24.537
Public at the Bryan Rotary Club Newman 10 award 
ceremony. 10 individuals and businesses here are

00:25.428 --> 00:40.168
recognized as being the top 10 in the count in Bryan 
College Station and yours truly is the speaker on

00:25.428 --> 00:40.168
that occasion. Don't worry about anything I'm 
saying right now. This is just informational and

00:42.451 --> 00:54.147
this highway east of Bastrop is a noisy highway so 
I'm hoping this is picking up. We'll soon see.

01:01.338 --> 01:26.839
Today, as we begin a new century, perhaps it is 
appropriate for us to glance back briefly

01:01.338 --> 01:26.839
and try to learn as much as we can from our 
experience

01:01.338 --> 01:26.839
before we turn forward

01:29.755 --> 01:32.839
with dreams and try to plan an even brighter 
future.

01:37.204 --> 01:49.459
The community that we now identify most often as 
Bryan College Station

01:37.204 --> 01:49.459
began about one of the third century ago. And

01:49.499 --> 01:58.530
it's beginning proves that transportation has 
been the key for our society.

02:04.245 --> 02:15.001
The railroad, which heading north from Houston,

02:04.245 --> 02:15.001
had been built as far as Milliken when the Civil War 
began.

02:18.546 --> 02:28.500
And after the end of that awesome, truly awesome 
conflict, that construction project continued

02:18.546 --> 02:28.500
quickly.

02:32.024 --> 02:35.828
And then made a curve through the middle of Brazos 
County.

02:38.732 --> 02:41.755
And identified a station stop.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.521
For a time as. As

02:46.581 --> 02:50.626
Bryan City.

02:56.112 --> 02:56.693
The distance. From the tracks to the county suit 
Brazos County seat of Boonville. soon caused

03:04.002 --> 03:14.317
everyone to move the county

03:04.002 --> 03:14.317
government to the new tracks.

03:17.762 --> 03:30.060
Within a decade, the leaders, the energetic 
leaders of this county had persuaded the state

03:17.762 --> 03:30.060
legislature to place the first public 
institution of higher education on those tracks

03:31.103 --> 03:55.204
about seven miles south of the courthouse

03:31.103 --> 03:55.204
where the post office address soon became known as 
College Station because it was located on the

03:31.103 --> 03:55.204
Houston and Texas Central Railroad tracks.

04:00.719 --> 04:21.987
Within a half century,

04:00.719 --> 04:21.987
the railroad had a transportation rival as the 
paved highway paralleled the railroad for many of

04:00.719 --> 04:21.987
the miles south from Bryan toward Navasota.

04:29.136 --> 04:29.697
Perhaps

04:32.883 --> 05:01.978
That transportation key in both its elements in 
the 20th century can be illustrated

04:32.883 --> 05:01.978
by the incident when the Aggies kidnapped the rice 
owl, nicknamed as Sammy, and placed it in the

04:32.883 --> 05:01.978
arsenal

04:32.883 --> 05:01.978
near on the southwest corner of the campus.

05:06.852 --> 05:13.500
Rice student volunteers came to rescue Sammy and 
headed South and their automobile. But the Aggies

05:15.243 --> 05:16.464
chased them. On the rail cars. And in automobiles.

05:25.836 --> 05:27.057
With the episode ending. With only a small 
portion. Of the rice owl making it back to Houston.

05:44.483 --> 05:50.049
When most people came to Brazos County in the early 
years, they came by rail. Then by. Auto and bus. But

05:57.377 --> 05:58.138
we had a. Very important. Interurban. Running 
from the North Gate area. To the middle of downtown

06:06.287 --> 06:07.708
Bryan. Paragraph. Today now we are at the 
intersection. of highways 6 and 21

06:14.386 --> 06:44.089
and

06:14.386 --> 06:44.089
save some time on the east and west bypasses

06:14.386 --> 06:44.089
plus using highways 47, 60

06:14.386 --> 06:44.089
and our newest transportation facility The 
Easterwood Airport

06:44.879 --> 07:01.555
is thankfully located at the intersection

06:44.879 --> 07:01.555
of highways 60, 47,

06:44.879 --> 07:01.555
and the West Bypass.

07:07.721 --> 07:12.085
A review, a quick glance at a map of the Lone Star 
State shows that we are in the middle

07:14.377 --> 07:41.852
of a transportation hub of the population 
triangle of Texas,

07:14.377 --> 07:41.852
extending in the north from the metroplex in the 
north to Houston

07:14.377 --> 07:41.852
and San Antonio, Austin.

07:46.017 --> 07:54.930
More than two-thirds of the people of this state 
live within that triangle.

07:58.956 --> 08:10.092
Or to put it in other words,

07:58.956 --> 08:10.092
there are more residents living within four hours 
of our community.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.940
There are twice as many people who live within four 
hours of our community as live in any of the states

08:16.561 --> 08:28.277
west of the Mississippi, except California and 
Texas.

08:37.690 --> 08:44.880
Some of us can look back on decades of progressive 
change here.

08:48.674 --> 09:17.500
When my wife and I arrived in the late summer of 
1959,

08:48.674 --> 09:17.500
we were told that there were about 25,000

08:48.674 --> 09:17.500
people in the county seat of Bryan and about 7,000 
out around the campus in College Station.

09:25.394 --> 09:29.519
Passenger trains still stopped regularly in both 
communities.

09:35.225 --> 09:42.953
And downtown pastors and pastors of some of the 
downtown churches learned that they needed to

09:35.225 --> 09:42.953
have their. 11 o'clock worship service sermon. 
Completed by 1155.

09:52.784 --> 09:53.545
Because. The locomotive engineers who stopped

09:55.482 --> 10:09.919
near the county and near the county courthouse 
would quite often sound off their steam whistles.

10:12.242 --> 10:19.330
If the choir was not, if the final, if the the 
concluding hymn of the service had not yet begun.

10:26.768 --> 10:32.535
What we thought was the large new shopping center 
at Townshire had just opened. With what seemed to

10:34.777 --> 10:43.387
be a very large Sears and Sears store.

10:43.488 --> 10:50.496
Very large Sears and Roebuck store.

10:50.516 --> 10:51.357
For those of us. Living in College Station. There 
was no real grocery store south of Orr's on Texas

10:55.608 --> 11:01.815
Avenue.

11:08.241 --> 11:14.408
And downtown Main Street and downtown Bryan 
seemed to be a busy place. So much so that in the

11:16.530 --> 11:21.075
summer of 1960,

11:26.641 --> 11:56.513
That street was repaved

11:26.641 --> 11:56.513
and the central parking island was laid

11:26.641 --> 11:56.513
with the cement being poured in the wee hours of the 
morning due to the unusual heat of that occasion

11:26.641 --> 11:56.513
and the

11:26.641 --> 11:56.513
lack of capability at that time to prepare cement 
that could safely bond

11:57.286 --> 12:22.831
in high temperatures.

12:22.851 --> 12:26.314
How much, paragraph, how much times have changed 
since then? Now,

12:28.370 --> 12:44.565
we should pause

12:28.370 --> 12:44.565
and look to the future and try to determine how we 
can make this fine community even better.

12:50.030 --> 12:55.035
Growth seems to be the best of all possible 
choices. But only if it is well planned.

13:02.701 --> 13:03.663
If there are skeptics. Who want who are opposed to 
growth? And want to live in a town. That is standing

13:11.794 --> 13:12.956
still. Or getting smaller. Each of us. Can think of 
a number of communities. Some not far away.

13:26.892 --> 13:42.967
that would offer these skeptics

13:26.892 --> 13:42.967
a free visa permit to join them.

13:42.987 --> 13:53.997
No, it seems that the most essential item is how can 
the growth be skillfully planned.

13:59.883 --> 14:08.430
Another example is to attempt to drive through 
Austin these days in the rush hour. That beautiful

14:08.450 --> 14:28.928
city,

14:08.450 --> 14:28.928
which truly is a splendid place geographically, 
is now so crowded

14:08.450 --> 14:28.928
in terms of traffic

14:08.450 --> 14:28.928
that even

14:31.760 --> 14:33.141
Orange blooded longhorns. Sometimes are 
looking. For new pastures.

14:42.071 --> 14:46.495
Paragraph in our planning, we should all work 
together.

14:49.278 --> 14:51.821
Yes, there are two municipal governments. Two 
school districts.

14:57.307 --> 15:00.450
A full array of county officials.

15:03.215 --> 15:08.381
But in fact, we have one community and one economy.

15:17.412 --> 15:31.990
The number crunchers believe that in the census of 
the year 2000, the combined population of Brazos

15:17.412 --> 15:31.990
County's two incorporated cities will total well 
beyond 130,000. Thus,

15:36.697 --> 15:55.581
because of location and size, we truly have become 
the business center for a fairly large area.

16:02.362 --> 16:05.306
Autumn many drivers commute to work. Here. From 
neighboring counties. And do so in increasing

16:10.594 --> 16:16.122
numbers.

16:16.142 --> 16:16.943
Key officials. In all of the counties touching. 
Brazos. Admit. That the economy here.

16:29.181 --> 16:30.242
Is the linchpin? of their county's future as well.

16:38.330 --> 16:53.246
Thus, one of the first things we should try to plan 
is to get the major roads that intersect here

16:38.330 --> 16:53.246
constructed as four lane divided thoroughfares.

16:55.729 --> 16:59.453
Not only would that improve the transportation It 
would also appear to a stranger who reviewed the

17:01.137 --> 17:15.578
map that we were not lost in the middle of East 
Central Texas.

17:18.562 --> 17:25.952
Remember that on some maps state highways appear 
to be minor league trails.

17:28.897 --> 17:29.878
And Brazos County. certainly has less than its 
share of federally designated highways. But if

17:37.072 --> 18:00.203
we, if all who care about the success, the future of 
Brazos County could work together, perhaps we

17:37.072 --> 18:00.203
could

17:37.072 --> 18:00.203
ensure that at least highways 21 and 6

18:00.453 --> 18:20.634
were four lane roads

18:00.453 --> 18:20.634
all the way from there all

18:00.453 --> 18:20.634
the way to the nearest interstates.

18:23.296 --> 18:29.903
Paragraph as a sidelight I have heard a report that 
our great former congressman olin teague

18:30.558 --> 18:54.658
on a few occasions noted that he had been unable to 
attend the committee of the house of

18:30.558 --> 18:54.658
representatives that designated the official 
route of the first interstates because at the same

18:56.815 --> 19:08.411
time that that decision was going to be made, he had 
to preside over the Veterans Affairs Committee as

18:56.815 --> 19:08.411
chairman. One of the routes decided at that 
meeting was the specific location of the

19:10.254 --> 19:25.455
interstate going from Dallas to Houston. Among 
the options, according to Congressman Teague's

19:27.308 --> 19:56.826
recollection, for that route was to follow 
Highway 75, was to, back up, one of the options was

19:27.308 --> 19:56.826
to come down Interstate 35, which had already been 
identified, from Dallas to Waco, and then have

19:27.308 --> 19:56.826
I-45 followed the route of Texas Highway 6 from 
Waco to Houston.

20:05.693 --> 20:20.469
The other option was to follow Highway US 75 from 
Dallas to Houston, the route which the committee

20:05.693 --> 20:20.469
eventually accepted.

20:20.489 --> 20:26.796
Thus, we can speculate that possibly we might have 
been our community might have enjoyed the

20:27.687 --> 20:40.465
benefits of an interstate thoroughfare

20:27.687 --> 20:40.465
for

20:27.687 --> 20:40.465
in recent decades.

20:51.221 --> 20:56.108
Another planning essential is land use

20:58.838 --> 21:01.582
and the protection of our quality of life. We must 
preserve the old and established and prepare the

21:03.545 --> 21:18.448
way for the new

21:03.545 --> 21:18.448
established neighborhoods should not be 
downgraded.

21:21.473 --> 21:24.998
And we must prepare for increased Automobile 
traffic everywhere.

21:37.389 --> 21:43.497
Another item relates to the 19th to the elections 
this November.

21:46.742 --> 21:51.168
Not only will we be electing a new chief executive 
of this nation. We will also be selecting a

21:55.522 --> 22:02.072
legislature which will reapportion and 
redistrict our booming state. Apparently, Texas

22:04.116 --> 22:10.265
will gain two or perhaps three new U.S. 
representatives.

22:12.889 --> 22:22.204
Because of the population shifts in the last 10 
years, state representative and senatorial

22:12.889 --> 22:22.204
districts will also be redrawn.

22:25.424 --> 22:53.473
Would it not be beneficial to all Brazos counties 
if those new lines were drawn in such a way that this

22:25.424 --> 22:53.473
county was a clear key ingredient in any in each of 
the districts in which we are located for the next

22:25.424 --> 22:53.473
decade?

22:56.288 --> 23:19.765
If that can be done, then our state 
representative, state senator and US

22:56.288 --> 23:19.765
representative would listen even more carefully 
to advice and counsel from the folks who live

22:56.288 --> 23:19.765
between the Navasota and the Brazos rivers.

23:29.870 --> 23:32.855
Also, we must make this community. We must clearly 
work to make this one community.

23:42.309 --> 23:44.733
Whether you call it BCS. Or if College Station 
passes Brian. In the official census. Count this

23:53.386 --> 23:55.509
year as is expected. The federal. bureaucrats may 
change it to CSB

23:58.895 --> 24:26.944
more importantly why would it not be better for us 
to search for a new title for our community that is

23:58.895 --> 24:26.944
non pejorative to any part of this area as the 
Metroplex for the Dallas-Fort Worth is inclusive

24:27.937 --> 24:42.015
and positive, like the Golden Triangle is in 
southeast Texas.

24:42.035 --> 24:56.374
Since the Brazos Valley is the most commonly 
accepted short title for our area, and we are the

24:42.035 --> 24:56.374
key location in that region,

24:59.408 --> 25:10.884
Would it be worthwhile to consider referring to 
this as the hub, the hub of the Brazos Valley?

25:16.171 --> 25:26.125
Paragraph, by whatever nomenclature we identify 
ourselves, we should try to make our qualities

25:16.171 --> 25:26.125
known more broadly.

25:29.007 --> 25:32.110
regionally and throughout the nation.

25:35.153 --> 25:39.757
If this is the hub, Texas A&M is the linchpin on that 
axle.

25:43.100 --> 25:56.533
And as we strive to attract industry,

25:43.100 --> 25:56.533
the best of all possible customers would be in high 
tech, high technology, where A&M has its greatest

25:58.741 --> 26:02.586
strengths. Another potential

26:02.606 --> 26:15.643
group of real benefit would be white collar 
retirees.

26:20.369 --> 26:26.217
Can you imagine

26:20.369 --> 26:26.217
that the products of Texas A&M and or Allen Academy 
who are approaching retirement

26:27.952 --> 26:41.066
might think about returning back home.

26:44.850 --> 26:55.461
Experience elsewhere has

26:44.850 --> 26:55.461
demonstrated that these middle class folks bring 
talent, tax base, and bank balances. They want far

27:01.907 --> 27:04.270
more than golf and tennis. They're looking for 
culture, art, music, athletic events, library,

27:06.153 --> 27:23.338
high quality medical services, law and order, and 
reasonable real estate costs. and they would like

27:25.040 --> 27:35.451
to be within a reasonably within reasonable 
proximity to a good airport.

27:35.471 --> 27:54.591
Other communities that already have 
successfully attracted

27:35.471 --> 27:54.591
the middle class retirees include Bloomington, 
Indiana, Lexington, Kentucky, Chapel Hill,

27:35.471 --> 27:54.591
North Carolina, Bozeman, Montana, And 
Charlottesville, VA.

27:56.343 --> 28:05.935
Those of us in academia.

28:05.955 --> 28:08.719
Know what each of those towns has in common. A big 
public institution.

28:17.931 --> 28:18.492
Paragraph. To those. Potential newcomers to our 
community.

28:27.140 --> 28:31.224
And to all others who we might attract here. We 
should emphasize our progress and positive

28:32.766 --> 28:37.670
positive qualities. Thankfully. We are blessed 
with a daily newspaper. That does so. Our eagle

28:47.620 --> 28:51.564
does fly higher than it did in earlier years.

28:54.687 --> 28:56.809
But it can do even more. by

28:57.852 --> 29:19.883
reporting more frequently on the many positive 
individuals and organizations who make this hub a

28:57.852 --> 29:19.883
more smoothly rotating community. The other 
media should do likewise and thus concentrate on

29:28.126 --> 29:56.867
all the news of our community including the very 
positive of course we must continue the splendid

29:28.126 --> 29:56.867
cultural growth in music and the arts

29:28.126 --> 29:56.867
but as we do so would it not be appropriate

29:28.126 --> 29:56.867
in the new millennium to pause and note those who 
have made the difference just as we are here today

29:57.657 --> 30:02.643
with these 10.

30:05.446 --> 30:24.627
Could there not be somehow a an annual event to 
record the people not only of the present but

30:05.446 --> 30:24.627
particularly the future who helped to endow us 
with the benefit Of their careers. Of good works.

30:31.478 --> 30:34.962
Could there be a Brazos Valley Walk of Fame? Or 
maybe drive of honor.

30:42.991 --> 30:44.312
With some kind of. Marker. Either in the sidewalk.

30:53.702 --> 30:54.343
Or a. Son to mark. To remind us of those who made the 
difference.

31:06.537 --> 31:12.086
Would we dare think of markers on Texas Avenue 
hanging from high on Texas Avenue? Beginning in

31:13.669 --> 31:20.280
each direction to go from the city limits, signs at 
Hensel Park.

31:25.373 --> 31:31.333
Paragraph similarly, we must continue to try to 
make Brazos County more beautiful.
