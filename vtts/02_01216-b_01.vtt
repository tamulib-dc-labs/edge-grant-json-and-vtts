00:01.145 --> 00:06.312
In business, we were talking about the Corps of 
Cadets movement, the Goodrich incident. How do

00:06.412 --> 00:08.495
you change the organization of the Corps? And I did 
a little looking around. In your history, you'll

00:12.280 --> 00:22.833
recall that the Corps at one time had a commandant 
of cadets who worked directly for the university.

00:24.375 --> 00:25.557
And that's what I wanted. I wanted somebody who was 
loyal to the institution and not to the Army or Navy

00:25.577 --> 00:31.084
or Air Force. how do you do that henry how do you 
change the corps of cadets you know it's like

00:32.617 --> 01:02.235
moving a graveyard so what i did was create a 
committee in on which i asked the chief of staff of

00:32.617 --> 01:02.235
the marine corps chief of staff of the army

00:32.617 --> 01:02.235
the chief of navy education an admiral who's in 
charge of the naval pro naval education program

01:02.688 --> 01:12.564
And the general who was in charge of our ROTC region

01:02.688 --> 01:12.564
to come and take a look at the Corps of Cadets. And 
they were great. Boy, they were great. They came in

01:16.270 --> 01:17.512
and looked at it. Have they ever done anything like 
this before? Yes, they've done that before. No,

01:22.736 --> 01:24.038
the Corps had not. But these guys, and there was a 
woman, a general of the region, ROTC, they had done

01:24.338 --> 01:31.648
something like this before. And the Admiral knew 
exactly what I was after. And they were great. They

01:35.614 --> 01:47.730
sat down with me when they first got here, and the 
general, the chief of the Marine Corps, whose name

01:35.614 --> 01:47.730
I will remember in a minute, who I really liked 
tremendously, he said, okay, let's start off with

01:35.614 --> 01:47.730
a key question. What do you want out of this 
business? And I said, well, I'll tell you exactly

01:51.541 --> 01:56.287
what I want, but it may not be what you think I ought 
to have. That's what I wanted to know. As long as you

01:58.229 --> 02:03.296
don't care if we don't give you exactly what you 
want. I said, no, I'll tell you what I'd like, but

02:03.316 --> 02:06.720
you're here to tell me. That's right. If it's the 
wrong thing, tell me. I told them I was hoping we'd

02:10.665 --> 02:13.288
get back to this. They said, did you have this 
before? Yes, at one time we had it, and we'd gotten

02:14.650 --> 02:17.333
away with it. So they were here for three days. They 
interviewed all kinds of corps members, all the

02:21.545 --> 02:27.473
officers of the services who were stunned at all 
the stars sitting at that table. And I knew I had to

02:29.136 --> 02:33.382
do this if I was going to change the Corps, Henry. 
The board wasn't going to let me do a damn thing to it

02:33.402 --> 02:41.733
unless I went in with a blue ribbon report. So I got a 
report saying this was indeed the thing to do, and

02:41.753 --> 02:51.467
what had happened in the Corps, the committee 
said, was reprehensible and should never be

02:41.753 --> 02:51.467
allowed to happen again. Now, was this largely in 
response to the Goodrich incident? Yes. I think

02:55.541 --> 02:58.484
this was the Goodrich incident that triggered it. 
There may have been one in between, but I think this

02:58.504 --> 03:01.788
was it. And so I took this report to the board. And 
what could the board say? I mean, this thing was

03:08.176 --> 03:10.018
dripping with stars. Every service was 
represented, including the ROTC reach. Nobody on

03:16.366 --> 03:20.831
there lower than a general officer or an admiral. 
So, man... I had the board boxed. The only time I

03:24.519 --> 03:29.126
ever did it.

03:29.146 --> 03:38.881
So then I was able to, and I even, I asked him while I 
had him, after I saw the report, I said, who do you

03:29.146 --> 03:38.881
have that I ought to hire? And there was some debate 
about this, and they finally said, look, there's a

03:38.901 --> 03:45.191
guy in the Air Force who's an Aggie. He says, it's 
very important you get an Aggie who's about to

03:45.211 --> 03:51.981
retire, and he's a deputy Commander Atlantic 
Fleet. He's an Air Force officer.

03:58.830 --> 03:59.992
His name is Tom Darley. So I hired General Darley.

04:05.159 --> 04:08.463
He had some good men under him, too, about that 
time. Yeah. Burton was the Army guy. A good Marine

04:12.048 --> 04:14.211
officer, Colonel Johnson. And there were two or 
three others, I can't remember. But they were all

04:17.015 --> 04:21.200
so impressed with this committee that they were 
all walking around in attention. Yeah. Do you

04:21.965 --> 04:27.073
think that the Corps had pretty much dominated the 
character of Texas A&M? Yes. Before that time,

04:28.274 --> 04:31.479
during that time, still does? I think it was trying 
still to dominate A&M during that time, but there

04:31.719 --> 04:41.213
was growing friction between it and the 
fraternities and sororities, as you know. And

04:42.375 --> 04:50.487
it's now in such a minority status that I think it 
doesn't dominate it as it did, but it still

04:42.375 --> 04:50.487
presents What I think is its great value, and I've 
always thought it was its great value, was that it

04:50.888 --> 05:00.438
is sort of the keeper of the keys of the tradition of 
the institution. It is the thing that makes A&M

05:00.539 --> 05:06.845
different, and I think positively different, in 
the positive sense. I think the Corps has always

05:06.926 --> 05:14.233
been a good influence, but it occasionally gets 
too wrapped up in itself, and then you get real

05:06.926 --> 05:14.233
problems. That's when you have to do something 
like this.

05:19.475 --> 05:26.182
Was Fred McClure one of the commanders, four 
commanders when you were here? He was a black guy.

05:27.504 --> 05:30.047
Was he corps commander or was he president of the 
student body? President of the student body,

05:30.267 --> 05:32.129
that's right. Was he a member of the corps? Well, he 
had just gone before I got here. He was wonderful.

05:39.537 --> 05:45.964
I've always thought of the corps, one of his great 
assets and strengths, as a good minority group.

05:45.984 --> 05:46.765
Absolutely. Still is. Still is. What do you see as 
the future of the Corps at Texas A&M and military

05:49.732 --> 05:56.198
programs in general? I can't see the Corps ever 
disappearing from Texas A&M. I can't see. I think

06:02.143 --> 06:05.746
that would be a disaster for the institution. I 
know you and I share this same view. What would you

06:08.289 --> 06:10.471
have at A&M? You'd have another University of 
Texas, only a smaller one, a little bit. You

06:15.555 --> 06:17.697
wouldn't have a distinctive institution. with 
the kind of representation of tradition, which I

06:19.347 --> 06:26.618
think is vital to a place like this. Do you think 
that is one of the unique qualities? Oh, yes.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.547
That's one of the reasons I wanted to come to A&M. I 
really believed in the idea of the

06:33.208 --> 06:42.022
Corps doesn't have the motto of duty, honor, 
country, but it represents that. And that, to me,

06:42.543 --> 06:44.646
is all to the good. As an old tea sipper, it's been 
quite a revelation for me, too. Yeah, isn't it? It

06:49.948 --> 06:51.270
really is. And I have come to be a great admirer of 
Coke, as you are. Well, I don't want to... Oh, go on.

06:58.580 --> 06:59.321
I'm having fun. Oh, all right. With the... We've 
talked about minority recruiting. We've talked

07:05.189 --> 07:06.551
about the four cadets. What about growth, just 
pure physical growth? Was that a problem for you

07:11.618 --> 07:13.621
during your eight years? Mm-hmm. It was. And Gordy 
and I, along with others, the deans all together,

07:15.326 --> 07:23.138
decided we were going to have to try to stop it. 
Unbridled growth was going to lead to disaster

07:25.681 --> 07:29.948
because the budget was leveling off. And it was 
hard for everybody to accept that, Henry, to stop

07:31.690 --> 07:39.381
growth. It was hard for me to accept it. It was 
secret. It was hard for me to stop it because I liked

07:44.212 --> 07:47.417
the thought that A&M was growing. It made me feel 
that people loved the university and wanted to

07:47.437 --> 07:51.202
send their children here. I liked that. But at the 
same time, I knew we couldn't go on this way because

07:52.965 --> 07:58.873
we were going to lose quality with numbers. The 
money was stopping so the library couldn't grow.

08:04.081 --> 08:07.105
Scientific equipment couldn't keep up. We 
weren't going to be able to keep up with classroom

08:07.125 --> 08:09.709
footage. We were going to have to stop growth. Now, 
how do you do that? because the board has the same

08:14.688 --> 08:17.854
feeling I have. It's very nice that wherever the 
board goes, people want to send their kids to A&M.

08:24.325 --> 08:31.958
Was there any sense among, you always hear this 
gossip, among board members that they really did

08:24.325 --> 08:31.958
want A&M to be as big as Texas? Oh, yeah. Bigger. 
Bigger. Bigger. Sure. Sure. So limiting would be

08:38.490 --> 08:39.892
very hard. Mm-hmm. Excuse me, there was no doubt 
that it was better already. You understand that?

08:44.489 --> 08:47.854
Oh, yeah, right. But bigger, bigger was better. So 
how do you persuade them that it ain't? Well, the

08:55.625 --> 08:59.049
board had changed a little. John Mobley had come on 
from Austin. The guy from San Antonio, who runs all

09:05.338 --> 09:10.986
the radio stations, Hayes? Mayes. Mayes was on.

09:19.557 --> 09:23.062
There was a little more opening.

09:29.991 --> 09:31.933
Who was the guy who later became chairman of the 
board? I should remember his name well. A very good

09:33.135 --> 09:35.778
friend of mine. Ran the Granada. Oh, sure. Ellard, 
David Ellard. David Ellard, sure. You ever see

09:43.333 --> 09:43.753
him? I see him every once in a while. Talk to him 
often.

09:50.240 --> 10:10.183
This group was more open to,

09:50.240 --> 10:10.183
the pitch I kept making and Gordy kept making to 
him, and the dean,

09:50.240 --> 10:10.183
was, look, we're not only trying to modernize A&M, 
we're trying to improve it. to make it the best

10:11.665 --> 10:15.249
university in Texas and in the area. Now that was 
something they could understand.

10:22.757 --> 10:29.024
So we made a plan, an academic plan, to level off the 
growth. And we had a long presentation to the board

10:29.044 --> 10:35.231
with all kinds of backup about why this had to be 
done. You know, dollars versus people. And they

10:40.076 --> 10:40.677
bought it. They bought the idea of it. Basically, 
what they did was slow growth through more

10:44.446 --> 10:48.490
selective recruiting. That's right. Selective 
recruiting. They didn't like that because they

10:50.752 --> 10:56.378
loved to tell their constituents wherever they 
were, we'll take anybody. Yeah, we'll take care of

10:56.818 --> 10:58.460
you. But they bought the idea of slow growth and 
selective growth. And we kept pointing out that

11:02.825 --> 11:06.368
the SAT numbers were going up. We were getting 
better students, getting better students.

11:13.951 --> 11:23.179
We were able to point out as the minority 
recruiting went along, we were not only getting

11:13.951 --> 11:23.179
more minorities, we were getting high-quality 
minorities, and we were keeping them. We could

11:23.199 --> 11:29.885
recruit minorities, and we still have the best 
record in the state for keeping them once we get

11:23.199 --> 11:29.885
them, and the board liked that. And the thing that 
really got them was the time we finally beat Rice

11:31.486 --> 11:42.456
and Texas in recruiting national merit scholars. 
Beat them one year. That was the greatest moment.

11:45.542 --> 11:48.425
Oh, the board was so proud they went around popping 
their buttons. What do you think was the most

11:50.246 --> 11:54.970
difficult time you had as president? God, there 
were so many, Henry. Was it athletics? Athletics

11:58.393 --> 11:59.934
was the worst, I think. Worst problem. And

12:02.136 --> 12:07.781
minority recruiting was hard. Minority 
recruiting was hard. As I say, they did it, but it

12:10.944 --> 12:12.645
was tough. What

12:13.722 --> 12:21.754
was the most difficult time you had or issue, let's 
say, with the board? Was there any special? There

12:24.878 --> 12:26.200
was one special day. Totally surprised me. I was 
not ready for this at all. That's when you really

12:31.327 --> 12:32.289
get it. That's when those things usually happen. 
That's right. I was summoned to the board. I

12:36.695 --> 12:38.057
thought the board had left town. I thought the 
board had left town, and I was summoned back. I'd

12:43.844 --> 12:53.276
already headed for the golf course, so I come back 
in my golf club, and they're all sitting there

12:43.844 --> 12:53.276
looking at me.

12:53.296 --> 12:54.137
The entree knew. My biggest enemy on the board was 
Billy Mack McKenzie, who, for reasons I do not know

12:54.618 --> 13:04.450
to this day, never liked me from the day I got the 
job. But he was always laying in the gap to get me,

13:04.771 --> 13:10.258
and he was sitting there literally enjoying this 
meeting, I could tell. So I knew I was in big

13:11.659 --> 13:13.682
trouble. and they were all looking at a copy of the 
battalion and there was some article i hadn't seen

13:14.759 --> 13:42.387
it and if i'd seen it it wouldn't have bothered me 
you know but there was an article in there critical

13:14.759 --> 13:42.387
of the board i don't know something they had they 
ought to have done maybe it had to do with

13:14.759 --> 13:42.387
minorities i don't know but anyway it was they were 
all pissed really and

13:43.160 --> 14:05.147
So one of them, I don't remember who it was, said,

13:43.160 --> 14:05.147
we want you to fire the editor of the battalion by 
tonight and close the newspaper down.

14:05.848 --> 14:09.673
Being totally unready for this, I didn't really 
know what to say, Henry. And while I was reeling

14:10.666 --> 14:16.734
from the shock, someone else pitched in, and you 
will love this one. Do you know that history

14:16.754 --> 14:22.942
professor who just said he is not in favor of mother 
home and country?

14:26.066 --> 14:29.310
Yes.

14:29.331 --> 14:34.277
I also knew, and don't put this in, that I had snuck 
him ten years. By not using his full name but his

14:36.164 --> 14:39.048
initials, I'd gotten him tenure. Oh, really? 
That's right. You were the only one who knows that.

14:43.695 --> 14:44.636
But I'm proud of that. And I said, yes, I know him. 
Does that son of a bitch have tenure? Yes, he does.

14:56.974 --> 14:58.236
Well, fire him anyway. And they meant it. It was not 
a joke. And I sat there looking a little stunned,

15:03.805 --> 15:06.007
I'm sure. Maybe my mouth was open, I don't know. And 
one of them said, if you won't do it, we'll get

15:09.471 --> 15:13.395
someone who will. Is that clear enough for you? So 
that put a new face on it. And then John Cole spoke

15:22.164 --> 15:25.948
up. And he said, well, Frank, isn't the issue of 
what the battalion says about us, And isn't the

15:33.809 --> 15:41.204
issue of what this professor says about mother, 
home, and country protected under the rubric of

15:33.809 --> 15:41.204
academic freedom? And I said, well, John, I would 
have thought so. He said, well, gentlemen, we're

15:46.155 --> 15:49.842
on record as supporting academic freedom. Can't 
we move on to something more fruitful? And the

15:53.924 --> 15:56.107
whole thing collapsed like a busted balloon. And 
defused it right there. Right there. You are

15:58.710 --> 16:00.873
greatly indebted to that man. Don't tell me I have 
always known him. That's a good story. Isn't that a

16:07.622 --> 16:08.564
great story? That's a great story. Now there is a 
regent who was a regent. Can't we move on to

16:14.451 --> 16:16.354
something more fruitful? Well, I remember those 
times because that history professor was in my

16:16.520 --> 16:19.883
department. I know he was. I know he was. And he gave 
me hell, too. Well, you know, I still think we did

16:24.587 --> 16:27.290
the right thing. Well, I know you did. You did, too. 
He was a great teacher. Yeah. He doesn't know how I

16:32.575 --> 16:35.698
snuck that tenure forward. Also, there's 
something else you need to know. You will find this

16:41.203 --> 16:44.586
not surprising, but I did when I first encountered 
him. The board spent endless hours on building

16:45.967 --> 16:50.191
programming. That was their main interest, 
building. They had an edifice complex,

16:52.674 --> 16:54.515
literally. But you send up a big pile of names for 
tenure, and they passed it in two minutes. They

17:00.762 --> 17:01.623
never even read it. And I thought, well, with 
people like the man you and I are talking about,

17:02.924 --> 17:08.429
they would have singled him out because they were 
so mad. They didn't even read the list of tenure.

17:10.371 --> 17:12.193
And this was the future of the university.

17:16.561 --> 17:20.006
Yeah, maybe, you know, that's good. Well, it had 
its good moments. It had its good moments. And one

17:25.014 --> 17:32.286
of the things that I put in that I'm proud of was a 
different way to review tenure and promotion. You

17:33.287 --> 17:35.671
probably know that it changed. It came up through 
the proper channels. And before the final

17:39.217 --> 17:43.243
decision was made, I read every tenure 
recommendation. And then, remember, I asked

17:43.966 --> 17:48.912
everybody to send up the ones they didn't want to 
promote. Because I was afraid people were being

17:50.074 --> 17:53.999
deliberately ignored. And I think that was the 
right thing to do. I think a lot of structure and

17:57.704 --> 18:02.170
form development was not here before. I think the 
old hierarchy had literally been bad. That was it.

18:07.677 --> 18:10.621
The deans and department heads. My big failure, 
you want to know my big failure? Yes. I wanted to

18:13.784 --> 18:17.109
change it from heads to chairman. Yeah. And I never 
could make it. Well, I guarantee you in history we

18:19.953 --> 18:22.617
did. It was kind of over my dead body, I might add. 
But it did. Maybe not entirely, but certainly in

18:30.328 --> 18:32.210
practice. Well, you know, I had suffered under a 
longstanding head. Not suffered. You know, I

18:40.162 --> 18:41.023
loved him. But he'd been head of the department at 
Rice for 31 years. Now, that is a bit long. That is

18:47.595 --> 18:48.836
long. We've had similar situations. Yes, I know. I 
know. Yes, I know. But then it seemed to me that we

18:52.741 --> 18:57.126
ought to, it didn't matter if you re-elected the 
same guy. That'd be fine, but we ought to have a way

18:57.146 --> 18:59.429
to do that. But I couldn't break that log jam. Okay, 
let's close out, but with some kind of comment from

19:01.572 --> 19:10.403
you, if you don't mind, about where you see A&M 
going this next decade or thereafter. I'm very

19:11.243 --> 19:12.164
worried. I'm very worried that the legislature, 
in its wisdom, is going to do its end from the

19:14.207 --> 19:22.017
standpoint of money. The expansion of the A&M 
system sounded good, but it's watering down a lot

19:23.639 --> 19:30.808
of the assets of the university. I

19:30.888 --> 19:35.133
think that's true. Now, Herb may have a different 
point of view, but it seems to me that each of these

19:39.998 --> 20:08.740
new institutions feel that they ought to have some 
part of the pie of course which is why they want to

19:39.998 --> 20:08.740
get into the system and the puff was created to make 
texas and a m that was supposed to be the excellence

19:39.998 --> 20:08.740
fund and it's now in there you're operating off the 
available fund it's now the non-available fund

19:39.998 --> 20:08.740
one of my favorite stories going around would 
irritate the aggies at first and then they loved it

19:39.998 --> 20:08.740
is what is this two-thirds This is one-third. And 
that's the way that it was divided. But we haven't

20:14.409 --> 20:16.172
got it anymore. The available fund is down to zip, 
practically. And it was, some years when I was in,

20:19.917 --> 20:28.369
it seems to me my memory has any kind of relevance 
still to reality. At one point in one year, we had

20:29.391 --> 20:33.917
$60 million in the available fund. which you could 
really do great things with. If you had a good

20:38.210 --> 20:41.554
academic plan, you could really do great things. 
So you think the financial constraints are there?

20:45.398 --> 20:46.980
That's going to hurt us badly. And every 
university does that. Oh, yeah, yeah. But it's

20:49.583 --> 21:00.555
going to be bad here because, and again, 
discounted because it may be me talking about the

20:49.583 --> 21:00.555
past, but I think we were really on a roll upward. I 
think we were doing extremely well. And I think

21:05.639 --> 21:10.426
it's plateauing because of money problems. And 
that hurts you. Sure.

21:14.472 --> 21:18.177
Well, I think that's maybe a sand, but a good place 
to close. Well, let me tell you one more thing. I'm

21:19.479 --> 21:22.564
trying to remember what year this was. This must 
have been about 86, when we were coming up to a new

21:22.584 --> 21:28.612
budget cycle. And it was clear that we were going to 
go through the same mess in Austin that we'd had the

21:29.934 --> 21:35.342
previous budget cycle, 84. And I knew we were going 
to, if we were lucky, very lucky, we might be even

21:36.993 --> 21:45.483
with the board, but we weren't going to have 
anything extra. And what the legislature was

21:45.503 --> 21:54.973
doing consistently, and that's what's working so 
badly now, was driving us increasingly back on the

21:45.503 --> 21:54.973
AUF. They'd say, you can give more money to the 
library, but take it out of the AUF. And they'd give

21:59.999 --> 22:01.220
it to somebody else. And at one point there, Gordy 
and I and later Donald, were pumping a million

22:05.933 --> 22:11.740
dollars a year out of the available fund extra into 
the library. You probably knew that because it was

22:12.381 --> 22:15.304
good for the history department. Yeah, and it 
still wasn't enough. It wasn't nearly enough, but

22:17.407 --> 22:21.191
that was our extra, you know. So I had a meeting of 
all the, I had the vice president of the United

22:21.211 --> 22:34.067
States, Eddie Joe, and all the vice presidents and 
deans, no, the vice presidents and the, and Gordy

22:35.397 --> 22:44.128
and them, and they were talking about the 
finances, and we had a big presentation on what the

22:35.397 --> 22:44.128
budget would look like and projecting it into the 
next year. And they gave me three plans, like they

22:44.909 --> 22:55.762
always gave Lyndon, three plans, A, B, and C, and 
they always had it structured so you had to take C.

22:44.909 --> 22:55.762
They used to piss him off, you know, and this was 
really pissing me off, too. C was the only one who

22:56.363 --> 22:59.707
was viable. I said, look, there's a fourth one you 
haven't constructed yet. I want you to construct

23:03.798 --> 23:14.788
me a budget for every college with 2% less than you 
have projected here on your program fee. What? I

23:16.009 --> 23:18.011
said, that's called the president's tax. And 
we're going to tax every college 2% and put it in the

23:18.912 --> 23:22.655
kitty for next year. And that's where the money 
came for the next year. And it worked. It worked.

23:28.621 --> 23:31.223
You got it all back, but you got it back when you 
really need it. I was very proud of that innovative

23:32.755 --> 23:36.779
system on the spur of the moment. While you're on 
the subject, what do you think about future

23:36.799 --> 23:48.051
funding in terms of the talk about using the 
lottery money and all this kind of stuff? I don't

23:48.071 --> 23:49.192
know what we're going to do. I don't think 
university funding in Texas is ever going to be

23:49.212 --> 23:56.640
worth a tinker's damn until we get to state income 
tax. I think that's what's going to have to happen,

23:56.740 --> 24:01.024
or some windfall profit from something. But it 
looks to me, you know, the problem is that

24:02.287 --> 24:13.866
educational money, particularly higher 
education, is one earmarked fund that the

24:02.287 --> 24:13.866
legislature can get its hands on. All the others 
are entitlements, and this they can grab. And

24:17.912 --> 24:19.595
that's what's hurting us. So you have to battle for 
it. Oh, it's getting worse and worse. I just feel

24:22.960 --> 24:27.427
for Eddie Joe and Bill and Herb when they go over to 
Austin. I tell you, it is no fun. How'd you happen to

24:31.244 --> 24:35.648
decide you were ready to leave the presidency? 
Well, I got to, you know, I don't know if I can

24:35.668 --> 24:41.132
explain it except in schematic terms. I got 
vibrations, feelings, that my time was about up. I

24:47.718 --> 24:54.744
got the feeling that, you know, I could hang on a 
while, but I'd done about all I was going to be able

24:47.718 --> 24:54.744
to do. And when you get the feeling that you're 
being tolerated That's the time to get out before

25:02.159 --> 25:10.471
they push you out.

25:10.711 --> 25:12.413
But you decided you wanted to stay at A&M. Yeah, I 
liked A&M. I didn't want to rush off somewhere

25:14.396 --> 25:16.459
else. I had two or three places I might have gone, 
but I thought I'd stay here. Because here I have a

25:20.665 --> 25:24.490
great opportunity to write books and enjoy myself 
and teach. Yeah, I didn't want to leave A&M. I liked

25:27.534 --> 25:28.015
it. So you retired from the, or you stepped down 
from the presidency, affected when? The end of the

25:35.223 --> 25:36.844
academic year 88. And you became director of the 
Mosier Institute. Yes, yes. At that point. Yeah,

25:44.351 --> 25:44.771
right. And what was I going to tell

25:46.213 --> 25:53.039
you? Oh, something I'd like to say in favor of the 
Board of Regents. Every single academic request

25:58.977 --> 26:27.128
academic request that the administration took to 
the board we got very good that's a very strong

25:58.977 --> 26:27.128
regard i think that's very important to be in the 
record all right sir thank you so much for your time

25:58.977 --> 26:27.128
you're welcome appreciate it very much and i may 
come back to you on the phone or the person and ask

25:58.977 --> 26:27.128
you would you explain this a little bit or 
something you're most welcome you're most

25:58.977 --> 26:27.128
welcome But I think this would be a big help. And as I 
say, it's going to be more of an impressionistic

26:29.982 --> 26:34.262
approach, I think, when I start writing. Well, I'm 
glad you did it, because I never...
