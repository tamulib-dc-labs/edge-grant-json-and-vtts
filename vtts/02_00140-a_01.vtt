WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:15.311
for 1998 and for me it is a great honor to be in the office of John Lindsay in Houston and to be chatting with him about his recollections of student days at Texas A&M.

00:15.491 --> 00:17.813
Now we'll stop and see that the machine is working.

00:20.376 --> 00:25.000
Begin if you would please by telling me why did you go to A&M?

00:25.161 --> 00:31.607
What led you there instead of somewhere else or maybe nowhere else?

00:32.448 --> 00:35.893
I think it was a variety of reasons.

00:37.075 --> 00:41.201
And I really don't know in what order they were.

00:42.503 --> 01:02.252
But one of the reasons was that at least two people that I knew, Conrad Baring, the class of 43, was already there.

01:03.093 --> 01:13.867
and Fort Albritton, who was in the class of 43, who was already there, had talked to me about coming to A&M.

01:14.327 --> 01:18.252
And their parents were friends of my parents.

01:18.272 --> 01:27.144
And I know that their parents got with my parents a couple of times beforehand and were talking to them about Texas A&M.

01:29.567 --> 01:30.568
I know that

01:31.578 --> 01:35.084
I was very interested in football also.

01:35.104 --> 01:43.078
And if you recall the year before, Texas A&M had been national champions and everyone was toasting.

01:46.785 --> 01:56.742
Interesting to note that on New Year's Eve of 1939,

01:57.633 --> 02:20.258
When the Aggies were playing in the Sugar Bowl for the national championship, I was at a house party down at the bay near Houston with the farmer Barbara Golding, who later became Mrs. John Kimbrough.

02:20.619 --> 02:22.881
I'm not sure she knew him at that time.

02:23.232 --> 02:32.922
But I've always remembered that later after they got married that we were there to spend the night and didn't sleep much that night.

02:33.122 --> 02:45.575
But the next day I do remember listening on the radio to the Aggies playing Tulane for the national championship.

02:45.595 --> 02:50.019
But a variety of things like that.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.041
Some of my

02:52.460 --> 03:03.169
Good friends, Ben Lenny, who became my roommate, was coming to A&M, I knew, and several others that I knew in school.

03:04.330 --> 03:15.861
And I had no idea what I wanted to do, what I wanted to take or anything, but those were my recollections.

03:15.921 --> 03:19.844
Did you go up to visit before you decided to enroll?

03:21.826 --> 03:22.146
I didn't.

03:23.510 --> 03:24.051
Just went.

03:24.551 --> 03:25.052
Just went.

03:25.833 --> 03:34.082
Alright, now describe if you can remember, describe the trip when you take whatever paraphernalia you had.

03:35.103 --> 03:37.926
How did you get from Houston on that trip up there?

03:38.687 --> 03:39.668
My mother took me up.

03:40.609 --> 03:41.109
In a car?

03:41.310 --> 03:41.770
In a car.

03:42.050 --> 03:44.573
And describe the baggage that you took with you.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.256
You know, I don't remember much about that.

03:47.725 --> 03:51.189
Was it a suitcase or plenty suitcases?

03:51.289 --> 03:53.432
It was several and there was a lamp.

03:53.452 --> 03:54.754
I had to take a lamp.

03:54.874 --> 03:58.699
We were told what we needed to bring.

03:59.560 --> 04:05.367
Each of us had a lamp and we didn't have a TV to worry about.

04:05.427 --> 04:09.692
About how much clothing?

04:09.712 --> 04:15.960
Very little clothing because it was all going to be in uniform and there was no time for us to wear.

04:16.835 --> 04:20.260
civilian clothing.

04:21.202 --> 04:34.582
As I recall, while at A&M, I don't think I ever wore anything other than a uniform, other than when I wore shorts to go out and play tennis or something like that.

04:35.023 --> 04:42.454
From your house on the west side of Houston to the A&M campus, by your student, was about what length of time

04:43.025 --> 04:43.926
In driving time?

04:44.226 --> 04:45.828
Seemed like about two and a half hours.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.831
About two and a half.

04:48.851 --> 04:49.192
Let's see.

04:49.272 --> 04:53.156
Describe the campus during your student days.

04:53.216 --> 05:01.044
Of course, that two and a half hours was if you had a car and were in control of who was driving it.

05:02.206 --> 05:04.989
But that isn't the way I got to end that most of the time.

05:05.629 --> 05:06.230
I hitchhiked.

05:06.790 --> 05:07.671
Tell me about Aggie.

05:07.852 --> 05:09.353
I've heard about Aggie Hitchhiking.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.354
Tell me more about it.

05:10.414 --> 05:11.215
How's that done?

05:11.235 --> 05:12.897
That was the only way

05:13.535 --> 05:19.542
From that first day, my mother took me up there.

05:19.562 --> 05:24.147
But from then on, I hitchhiked.

05:24.167 --> 05:30.494
And we had a place out on Shepherd in Washington Avenue in Houston.

05:30.514 --> 05:35.340
It was a wine garden store on the corner.

05:35.928 --> 05:45.362
Anyone, an Aggie that wanted to go back to College Station came there anytime Sunday afternoon, late Sunday afternoon, anytime in the night.

05:46.163 --> 05:47.405
It was an automatic corner.

05:47.425 --> 05:54.115
Most people in Houston knew that the Aggies were there and that it was okay to pick them up.

05:54.135 --> 05:56.939
And most cars that were going out on the road picked up Aggies.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.224
What did you have on when you were hitchhiking?

06:00.244 --> 06:00.664
My uniform.

06:01.225 --> 06:02.627
Did you put your thumb up?

06:02.742 --> 06:03.283
Oh, yes.

06:03.844 --> 06:05.686
Did you hold a sign?

06:06.127 --> 06:07.689
No, didn't have to put a sign up.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.532
We had our bags there in order.

06:09.592 --> 06:11.936
You'd get up there and you'd put your bag at the end of the line.

06:12.697 --> 06:18.406
And then whoever was first would stand up and put the thumb out.

06:18.426 --> 06:22.652
The cars would stop and pick up and say, I'll take one or I'll take two or I'll take three.

06:22.692 --> 06:23.854
Some of them took four.

06:24.915 --> 06:25.777
Of course, we loved those.

06:25.857 --> 06:26.558
It took a lot.

06:26.818 --> 06:27.940
Now, class rank.

06:28.763 --> 06:32.597
Academic status had nothing to do with it.

06:33.441 --> 06:37.255
You stood in line, but whenever you got there, you were the next in line.

06:37.623 --> 06:42.848
Alright, coming from College Station to Houston, where was the place though?

06:43.289 --> 06:46.171
At the main gate, at the front gate.

06:47.312 --> 06:49.515
What did you all call it then?

06:49.535 --> 06:49.975
East gate?

06:50.476 --> 06:50.716
No.

06:51.096 --> 06:52.117
You didn't call it East gate?

06:52.137 --> 06:54.680
No, we just called it the Houston Highway gate.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.981
Okay, but it was the east side of campus?

06:56.101 --> 06:57.062
Right.

06:57.082 --> 07:03.468
In front of what is now the Jack Williams Administration Building.

07:04.709 --> 07:07.292
Let's see, describe the campus.

07:08.217 --> 07:08.758
Physically.

07:08.778 --> 07:10.439
What buildings were there?

07:10.459 --> 07:12.742
What was it?

07:12.762 --> 07:19.469
Let's see what I was going to say about that hitchhiking.

07:19.489 --> 07:20.090
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:21.671 --> 07:24.174
Were there any incidents that you remember?

07:24.194 --> 07:28.599
No, that was the interesting thing about it, the hitchhiking.

07:32.002 --> 07:37.448
I can't remember any time where

07:38.356 --> 07:43.884
I was really nervous about anyone that picked me up.

07:44.465 --> 07:48.130
There were some, what we thought, crazy people, of course.

07:48.731 --> 07:55.181
I mean, any college student would think that sometimes about older people, I think.

07:56.022 --> 08:02.932
And some people would get off on subjects about themselves and things, you know, we would be bored with that.

08:02.952 --> 08:04.414
But we tried to be

08:04.748 --> 08:18.723
because we knew that we were gonna be doing this again and we were always put on guard to, that we were to be on our best behavior at all times because this is the way Aggies got around the state.

08:18.743 --> 08:29.955
And later, there was a time when I would hitchhike to Austin on Wednesday afternoons.

08:31.436 --> 08:33.118
A friend of mine, Sid Smith and I,

08:33.892 --> 08:42.385
We'd go over there and sometimes, not have a date, just go over there and go by and see some of the girls we knew that were in school there.

08:42.405 --> 08:46.231
All right, to go to Austin, where was the pickup place near the campus?

08:48.996 --> 08:50.158
You know, I forgot.

08:50.178 --> 08:52.581
Isn't that funny?

08:52.722 --> 08:57.469
And generally were- But we could, there was a place everywhere.

08:57.736 --> 09:01.540
Every place had, I don't remember where it was in Dallas either, or Fort Worth.

09:01.700 --> 09:06.906
Normally, did you have a bag or a suitcase with an A&M symbol on it?

09:07.267 --> 09:08.328
No, not necessarily.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.789
So it was the uniform?

09:09.890 --> 09:17.218
We had the uniform on, and everybody knew what that uniform was, and we always wore a uniform.

09:17.318 --> 09:19.360
When I went to Austin, I'd wear the uniform.

09:19.380 --> 09:24.626
In that era, did you hear about other institutions doing the same kind of thing?

09:24.746 --> 09:26.528
I've never heard of... No.

09:26.879 --> 09:30.165
To me, this is a comparatively unique practice.

09:30.225 --> 09:38.140
No, but I know University of Texas people hitchhiked too, but they didn't have a uniform.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.226
But they had places, I suppose,

09:41.662 --> 09:46.669
like this, I had run into people that I knew at the University of Texas at Hempstead.

09:47.009 --> 09:49.152
You know, I got a ride to Hempstead sometimes.

09:49.172 --> 09:54.440
That was kind of a mistake to take a ride other than... Like nonstop?

09:54.460 --> 09:56.983
Yeah, because sometimes you get caught.

09:57.023 --> 09:58.625
There's not as much traffic.

09:59.446 --> 10:03.352
People that would pick you up would already have a car full from behind you.

10:03.432 --> 10:10.842
So I've been in Madisonville, coming back from Dallas,

10:11.378 --> 10:24.512
until very late in the morning, and finally had to take a truck, loaded a pipe, and we rode on the back of this truck, cold, must have been 30 degrees.

10:24.712 --> 10:31.919
We just about froze from Madisonville to college today, and the coldest I've ever been in my whole life.

10:31.939 --> 10:38.466
But it was two or three o'clock in the morning, and there just weren't any cars out there, and we were ready to get home.

10:39.155 --> 10:41.317
coming from a weekend in Dallas.

10:42.539 --> 10:47.725
Okay, describe the campus during your days there.

10:47.745 --> 10:56.114
Well, of course, there was no Memorial Student Center.

10:58.777 --> 11:02.721
And we didn't have time to go to the Memorial Student Center either.

11:02.881 --> 11:07.086
Anyway, as freshmen, we were busy, very busy.

11:07.268 --> 11:08.750
Where'd you live?

11:09.010 --> 11:11.574
I lived in number four.

11:11.594 --> 11:12.054
Which was?

11:12.094 --> 11:15.038
Which is in the core area now.

11:15.058 --> 11:19.784
It's the second... Describe those buildings.

11:20.145 --> 11:25.772
They were called the Newd Arms and they were built in, I think, the year before I got there.

11:25.873 --> 11:32.321
I came in 1940 and they were built in 1939, I believe.

11:32.341 --> 11:36.887
And they were nice, very nice, very clean, very easy to take care of.

11:37.762 --> 11:48.357
And I lived on the fourth floor and it didn't bother me to be, I can't remember being sorry that I wasn't on the first floor.

11:48.938 --> 11:54.186
I'd just seem to go up four flights of stairs, just go up, you know, not go up many flights of stairs at all.

11:55.367 --> 12:02.858
I would hate that now, of course, but it didn't seem to bother me.

12:03.243 --> 12:07.987
Talk about dorm life, some of the events.

12:09.168 --> 12:16.214
Well, there was a lot of hazy going on when I was in school.

12:16.374 --> 12:18.736
It was not a fun thing.

12:18.756 --> 12:20.237
Describe that hazy.

12:20.257 --> 12:28.204
Well, after dinner, every night, of course, we went to school during the day.

12:28.885 --> 12:30.426
We couldn't lock our doors.

12:31.207 --> 12:32.828
We had to keep the doors open.

12:33.584 --> 12:38.171
so that the upperclassmen could come and see, get us at any time.

12:38.191 --> 12:45.242
We were open game to run errands or just to general harassment.

12:46.884 --> 12:56.179
Every night after dinner, we'd all meet and the sophomores would give us hell about the day.

12:56.539 --> 13:01.026
He'd just generally give us a bad time.

13:01.367 --> 13:02.308
We'd beat our ass.

13:02.727 --> 13:03.228
With what?

13:03.628 --> 13:04.149
With boards.

13:04.630 --> 13:06.172
Of what sizes?

13:06.192 --> 13:06.913
Baseball bat.

13:07.473 --> 13:09.516
Playing down, you know.

13:09.536 --> 13:11.579
I mean, you know, good healthy swings.

13:11.599 --> 13:14.963
Was there supposedly a reason for the swats?

13:15.504 --> 13:20.070
No, just because we were freshmen and they felt like getting exercise.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.855
Normally a person got hit how many strokes?

13:25.698 --> 13:29.122
Three.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.165
And now your outfit was...

13:31.567 --> 13:34.251
Did it have a nickname?

13:37.416 --> 13:43.745
Was there any outfit that supposedly was the best academically or the worst?

13:43.765 --> 13:44.767
Were there some that were?

13:46.009 --> 13:48.913
I'm sure there were, but I didn't know about it.

13:49.714 --> 14:00.831
The thing that I remember most

14:05.654 --> 14:22.170
About my time after my freshman year was over, my junior year, I was the intramural manager of the outfit.

14:22.190 --> 14:26.635
And it was every outfit had an intramural team and they played all sports.

14:27.856 --> 14:35.003
And of course some sports everybody wanted to play and other sports they didn't want to play.

14:35.860 --> 14:38.404
important sport was water polo.

14:39.305 --> 14:45.414
Nobody wanted to do water polo, so the upperclassmen just, you know, didn't do that.

14:45.434 --> 14:49.119
Juniors and seniors did not play water polo.

14:51.463 --> 14:54.487
So it was a sophomore sport.

14:54.507 --> 14:55.629
No fish did this.

14:55.689 --> 14:59.134
I mean, this is upperclassmen.

14:59.823 --> 15:11.876
I remember that one night we had a water polo match, and my outfit had won the intramural flag the year before, and we were in line to win it again, and I wanted to win it again.

15:13.378 --> 15:21.627
And there was a big event going on at Town Hall that night, and the sophomores wanted to go to this event.

15:22.728 --> 15:28.294
And I said, no way, we've got to play water polo tonight.

15:28.780 --> 15:34.469
I'm going to the event, but you're going to go and say, what, pull up?

15:34.489 --> 15:37.153
Well, it was just, you know, no question about it.

15:37.253 --> 15:44.383
So I went comfortably to the event and later found out we forfeited.

15:44.403 --> 15:46.346
The sophomores went to it also.

15:48.690 --> 15:54.839
Well, that's about as bad a thing in those days in my life.

15:54.859 --> 15:56.762
That was about as bad a thing as you could do.

15:57.282 --> 15:59.605
It wasn't anything worse.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.827
Did anything happen to those sophomores?

16:01.847 --> 16:02.868
Oh, yes, that did.

16:03.068 --> 16:04.029
Can you describe that?

16:04.069 --> 16:04.870
Yes, I can.

16:05.511 --> 16:07.293
I can describe it in great detail.

16:08.634 --> 16:19.025
And it is very vivid in my memory because of the consequences that almost happened.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.528
I brought them all in.

16:22.810 --> 16:25.112
I got out my board and I whipped every one of them.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.163
Very, very, very strongly.

16:29.183 --> 16:35.212
I may have gone more than three on each one.

16:35.652 --> 16:47.948
This was on a probably a Thursday or could have been a Friday night, I believe.

16:48.509 --> 16:54.357
No, no, it was a Thursday night, so this is Friday when this happened, late Friday afternoon.

16:56.210 --> 17:04.120
Well, it makes a lot of noise, you know, when you're looking at somebody's foot.

17:04.140 --> 17:09.386
And I'm sure other people in the dorm knew what was going on.

17:09.406 --> 17:13.431
And I don't know whether our sophomores would dare tell anybody.

17:14.253 --> 17:18.197
But they were very serious, and they were very sorry about it.

17:18.438 --> 17:25.086
And they realized what they had done, and that this was what they knew was going to happen.

17:26.602 --> 17:31.247
So it happened, and I didn't think anything more.

17:31.267 --> 17:35.452
It was over, and we went on about our business.

17:35.472 --> 17:45.843
And Saturday morning, I was in my room, and I looked, and I could see a long ways down the street.

17:46.023 --> 17:55.073
I saw Captain Sale, who was my attack officer, Gloria Sale's husband, Lieutenant Sale was at the time.

17:56.217 --> 18:03.267
And this was before he married, but he was a brand new attack officer.

18:03.287 --> 18:06.292
I've forgotten what class chick was, the 38 I believe.

18:08.214 --> 18:09.576
And he was walking our way.

18:10.498 --> 18:14.764
And I got that cold chill came over and I said, surely he doesn't know.

18:15.745 --> 18:17.348
He wouldn't be coming this way.

18:19.050 --> 18:23.777
And sure enough, he kept heading this way.

18:24.348 --> 18:33.949
So I rushed down the hall, I got a couple of sophomores asked them get in the shower, take off your clothes and get in that shower and turn on that water so hot.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.596
I want to see nothing but steam coming under that door.

18:37.616 --> 18:44.972
I don't want anybody when they come in there to see any sophomore.

18:46.353 --> 18:51.520
You'd think that's a crazy thing to do, but that's what we do, what we did.

18:51.861 --> 18:55.306
And so all the sophomores got a bunch of them.

18:55.326 --> 18:58.870
They all jumped in the shower.

18:58.891 --> 19:00.272
And sure enough, it turned it on hot.

19:00.333 --> 19:03.197
And the steam was coming out of the window.

19:03.217 --> 19:10.707
And I watched Captain Sell, and he talked to a few people along the way, but sure enough, he came in the door and came right up to my room.

19:12.593 --> 19:15.076
And he said, good morning, how are you?

19:15.096 --> 19:17.439
And I said, I'm fine.

19:17.459 --> 19:20.423
He said, I heard a shower going down there.

19:20.443 --> 19:21.864
And I said, oh, really?

19:21.884 --> 19:26.310
And he said, yeah, it sounds like a bunch of people taking a shower.

19:26.330 --> 19:29.974
And I said, well, that's Saturday morning.

19:29.994 --> 19:33.018
I guess they're going out today.

19:33.038 --> 19:34.079
He said, sure, it's hot.

19:34.159 --> 19:35.981
The steam was coming out from under there.

19:36.001 --> 19:38.164
He said, you haven't seen it?

19:38.184 --> 19:40.086
And I said, no, sir, I haven't seen it.

19:40.106 --> 19:41.368
He said, well, come like this.

19:41.888 --> 19:43.530
I don't know, a lot of steam's come in.

19:43.590 --> 19:44.691
In fact, we opened the door.

19:44.731 --> 19:48.856
All you could see was all these bodies in the shower.

19:48.916 --> 19:57.025
There must have been 10 of them in there in the shower at the same time, which was more people in there than there were shower heads.

19:58.487 --> 20:01.591
So I think there was.

20:02.371 --> 20:10.180
Anyway, we came back to the room and he said, that sounds unusual that all these people would be taking showers at the same time.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.642
It's such a hot shower.

20:12.787 --> 20:16.093
And I was making this small talk.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.717
My heart was just pounding, you know.

20:19.018 --> 20:22.924
And he just kept me on the string.

20:23.606 --> 20:28.734
And finally he said, I think they're still in there or something.

20:28.754 --> 20:31.940
You know, after we've been talking for five or ten minutes.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.346
And I said, well, no, they're probably dirty.

20:36.768 --> 20:37.309
Anyway.

20:37.694 --> 20:44.242
He finally just got up and he said, well, Lindsay, I'll see you later.

20:44.262 --> 20:45.284
He walked down.

20:45.304 --> 20:47.987
He decided not to do anything about it.

20:48.007 --> 20:50.811
And he knew what had happened.

20:50.831 --> 20:51.872
Somebody had told him.

20:51.892 --> 20:54.796
I don't know who to him, but somebody had told him.

20:54.816 --> 20:56.939
And I could have been gone.

20:57.039 --> 20:58.661
I would have been expelled from school.

20:58.681 --> 21:00.043
You could have been kicked out of school.

21:00.223 --> 21:01.004
Oh, yeah.

21:01.024 --> 21:02.366
I would have been kicked out for that.

21:02.546 --> 21:03.167
By this time.

21:03.748 --> 21:05.710
Not for when I was a freshman.

21:06.162 --> 21:15.673
That was what was done, and nobody did anything about it, and there wasn't anybody that ever thought of changing that.

21:15.693 --> 21:27.226
But by the time I became a junior, it was getting pretty well along that we were not to be using our boards on people, and we didn't.

21:27.246 --> 21:30.690
It was extreme circumstances, but it was warranted.

21:30.710 --> 21:32.912
Did the sophomores retaliate

21:33.179 --> 21:34.682
did they play any trick on you?

21:34.782 --> 21:35.603
No, no.

21:35.684 --> 21:36.245
So they didn't?

21:36.425 --> 21:39.851
No, they were just, they were really glad that nothing happened.

21:39.891 --> 21:41.614
They were trying to cooperate with it too.

21:41.715 --> 21:43.358
They knew they had done something wrong.

21:43.378 --> 21:45.101
I mean, they knew that that had to happen.

21:45.161 --> 21:48.187
I mean, there was nobody mad at me because they did it.

21:48.447 --> 21:52.514
And this was just the way the thinking was at that time.

21:53.576 --> 21:55.520
They were not mad at me.

21:55.700 --> 21:56.622
I had some of my

21:57.074 --> 21:59.036
good friends with those sophomores.

21:59.056 --> 22:04.722
I really liked, there were three or four of them that were really good buddies of mine.

22:04.742 --> 22:06.344
I liked them all night.

22:06.364 --> 22:12.611
Do you remember any other tricks or pranks or good bull that you can share involving you or anybody else?

22:12.631 --> 22:16.855
Well, yes, I remember you mentioned this one you told me about.

22:17.256 --> 22:26.946
One I remember when my freshman year, we had a person in my outfit that

22:29.002 --> 22:32.265
It didn't take a bath.

22:32.285 --> 22:33.666
He smelled.

22:35.988 --> 22:39.191
I don't know how far this is going to go.

22:39.451 --> 22:43.275
If it's bad, you can mark it out on the time script.

22:44.155 --> 22:45.997
This guy smelled.

22:46.397 --> 22:49.000
It was just that he needed a bath.

22:49.180 --> 22:53.283
We decided we would do something about it.

22:53.323 --> 22:58.468
We had some engineers that

22:58.887 --> 23:02.532
We got together and decided what we would do about it.

23:02.552 --> 23:04.254
And it was absolutely unique.

23:04.274 --> 23:08.299
This was not my idea, but I was right in the middle of it.

23:10.002 --> 23:11.484
We had these basins.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.927
Every room had a basin in it.

23:13.947 --> 23:24.541
And the door didn't have that much room under our doors as it did over in the doors where you were talking about.

23:25.041 --> 23:28.506
But there was, you know, some room.

23:30.292 --> 23:35.019
Well, the plan was to loosen.

23:35.439 --> 23:40.527
The basin had a little pipe came down and turned around like that and then went out.

23:40.767 --> 23:50.822
And at the bottom of this pipe, there was a screw that you could take out and let the water out if it ever got stopped up.

23:51.403 --> 23:56.290
The handles on the basin could also be taken off.

23:57.331 --> 23:59.995
I mean, you could unscrew them.

24:00.430 --> 24:04.375
turn on the water, take off the hands.

24:04.395 --> 24:07.718
So we got all those loose.

24:08.339 --> 24:09.821
We got this thing down there loose.

24:10.722 --> 24:25.439
And one night when everybody went to bed, we got up late in the night and went in there quietly and took that bottom out, turned on the water.

24:26.420 --> 24:30.184
Oh, you also have to take the

24:30.451 --> 24:33.334
the handle off the door, which is very easy.

24:33.354 --> 24:34.715
Those doors were real simple.

24:34.735 --> 24:35.876
They had screws right there.

24:36.317 --> 24:37.598
Everything was simple.

24:37.618 --> 24:38.599
You just unscrew it.

24:40.001 --> 24:47.948
So we took the bottom thing off, then took the handles, made them loose, turned on the water real quick, and two others were taking the handle off the door.

24:48.489 --> 24:53.154
We slammed the door, put a towel under it, and the water is on.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.577
And it's come down, and they can't turn it off.

24:58.362 --> 25:01.185
And I don't know how long it took.

25:02.085 --> 25:04.307
But that room, that filled up to the window.

25:05.809 --> 25:09.592
And the victim is in the room?

25:09.792 --> 25:11.034
And the victims are in the room.

25:12.014 --> 25:14.717
Both of them.

25:14.877 --> 25:17.019
But they're taking a bath by this time.

25:17.059 --> 25:17.900
They were out of bed.

25:18.420 --> 25:23.425
And the water is up to the window still, two or three feet to the top.

25:24.926 --> 25:26.968
And I tell you, they finally...

25:28.062 --> 25:31.948
Got that handle put back on the door that we had the handles off.

25:31.968 --> 25:35.754
And the sophomores, I mean, it was a total mess.

25:36.054 --> 25:36.655
It really was.

25:36.675 --> 25:40.140
We never thought about what would happen when the door was finally open.

25:40.881 --> 25:43.145
Because the water went over.

25:43.165 --> 25:44.327
We were on the fourth floor.

25:44.988 --> 25:48.453
Water went all down the stairs.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.417
Well, we got our ass beat for that.

25:51.437 --> 25:53.901
I mean, we really got it.

25:54.218 --> 25:58.704
The whole outfit, the whole freshman outfit was playing for that.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.707
And we were all that followed.

26:00.827 --> 26:04.992
Alright, now did y'all use the term good bull for things like that then?

26:05.973 --> 26:07.135
Was that an Aggie term then?

26:07.956 --> 26:09.758
Yeah, yeah, that's good bull.

26:09.779 --> 26:13.403
Alright, any others you remember?

26:16.547 --> 26:18.690
That's the outstanding.

26:19.131 --> 26:23.837
Alright, summarize a typical weekday

26:24.408 --> 26:27.672
for a freshman in the Corps?

26:27.692 --> 26:30.495
In your... Freshman weekday.

26:31.376 --> 26:38.343
My day was a little different because we had to clean up a room for an upperclassman every day.

26:39.645 --> 26:40.546
Every day.

26:41.287 --> 26:41.547
Why?

26:42.148 --> 26:44.350
Because that was part of our job.

26:44.370 --> 26:48.194
Every morning I had to get up and go clean an upperclassman's room.

26:48.354 --> 26:50.417
Did every freshman or was it just your outfit?

26:50.497 --> 26:51.037
No, no, no.

26:51.097 --> 26:53.340
Every freshman.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.381
I was lucky enough

26:54.682 --> 27:04.602
to have an upper classman who lived in another dormitory, number 12, which was pretty far away down the street.

27:04.743 --> 27:09.974
And when it rained, my tough luck or when it was cold or whatever.

27:09.994 --> 27:14.563
But anyway, I cleaned up Eddie Prowl's room.

27:15.657 --> 27:17.920
P-R-O-W-E-L-L.

27:17.940 --> 27:21.124
He's dead now, but he's a wonderful guy, a nice guy.

27:21.144 --> 27:32.959
He was always nice to me, gave me presents, and appreciated it, but his room was filthy dirty every time, and he left turnoff.

27:36.824 --> 27:40.569
All right, so now, so you got up at about what time in the morning?

27:40.589 --> 27:41.270
Oh, it was early.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.613
I don't... Before 6, before Revlon?

27:43.633 --> 27:44.094
Oh, yeah.

27:44.694 --> 27:45.175
Oh, yeah.

27:45.526 --> 27:51.937
We had to get up in time to go clean up that room and then we had to clean up our room.

27:51.957 --> 27:56.184
And then we had to go march to breakfast.

27:56.204 --> 28:02.495
And then go to class and I took eighteen hours of class.

28:03.036 --> 28:07.804
Do you remember your first semester of classes?

28:08.442 --> 28:11.445
They take 15 hours, you know.

28:11.465 --> 28:12.446
Or some of them 12.

28:12.466 --> 28:13.406
Or some of them 12.

28:13.566 --> 28:14.948
What did you take as a freshman?

28:14.968 --> 28:15.348
Do you remember?

28:15.368 --> 28:19.332
Engineering, which I did very, very, very poorly.

28:20.252 --> 28:22.034
And I changed it midterm.

28:22.054 --> 28:22.374
To what?

28:22.394 --> 28:27.659
I had no idea what... What did you think you were going to do as an engineer?

28:27.819 --> 28:32.043
A civil... No, it was an all basic engineering course.

28:32.063 --> 28:34.765
It was no specialty at all.

28:34.785 --> 28:36.947
And those were math, physics, what?

28:37.484 --> 28:38.746
Yeah, math, physics, slide rules.

28:38.766 --> 28:39.186
Do you remember that?

28:39.227 --> 28:39.707
What kind?

28:39.847 --> 28:40.208
Okay.

28:41.870 --> 28:42.551
Slide rule.

28:42.611 --> 28:44.875
You remember they had that engineering slide rule?

28:44.895 --> 28:46.858
And where did you carry that?

28:47.519 --> 28:48.320
Where did I carry it?

28:48.340 --> 28:48.500
Yes.

28:49.441 --> 28:53.768
Well, I carried it on the belt, yeah.

28:53.788 --> 28:55.630
But, not for long.

28:55.650 --> 28:56.532
I didn't do very well.

28:56.552 --> 28:57.593
And so, you changed to?

28:57.693 --> 29:00.638
Changed to majoring in economics.

29:02.781 --> 29:05.044
Were there some faculty members?

29:06.020 --> 29:11.388
of your four years there that you remember particularly as important to you?

29:11.708 --> 29:13.451
Dr. Chalk, I remember very well.

29:13.491 --> 29:19.279
Describe Al Chalk as a person, as a immigrant.

29:19.299 --> 29:23.685
He was just a very, I thought, a very understanding.

29:23.705 --> 29:31.116
He was kind of gruff at first, but actually he had a lot to him and he

29:31.771 --> 29:39.942
He didn't run out of the room, but when the class was over he would stay there and you could talk to him.

29:40.102 --> 29:42.905
I didn't find that out for a while, but I finally did.

29:43.867 --> 29:45.829
It was my fault, not his.

29:46.590 --> 29:47.772
But he was a good professor.

29:48.533 --> 29:49.774
Did he have a nickname?

29:53.018 --> 29:56.082
Yeah, was it?

29:56.102 --> 29:56.563
I don't know.

29:58.822 --> 30:01.565
What about some of the other faculty members that you remember?

30:02.867 --> 30:04.489
Well of course I remember Dr. Harrington.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.631
He taught chemistry.

30:06.651 --> 30:06.991
Did he?

30:07.552 --> 30:10.736
And we had a freshman chemistry.

30:10.796 --> 30:12.558
Describe him as a chemistry teacher.

30:12.598 --> 30:13.939
Well he was excellent.

30:13.959 --> 30:16.242
He was really a wonderful person.

30:16.663 --> 30:23.410
He never did really change much the whole time I knew him until he died.

30:23.430 --> 30:24.472
I mean he looked the same.

30:24.572 --> 30:27.495
He was always very positive.

30:28.842 --> 30:29.443
Nice man.

30:30.324 --> 30:31.185
Did he have a nickname?

30:33.708 --> 30:35.389
No, I don't think so.

30:36.310 --> 30:36.671
English?

30:43.879 --> 30:44.660
Yeah, Mayo.

30:44.680 --> 30:48.144
Mayo teaching it for him.

30:48.164 --> 30:50.226
Dr. Mayo and Sam Gammon.

30:50.246 --> 30:51.848
Gammon's history wasn't it.

30:51.868 --> 30:52.709
Did he have a nickname?

30:53.450 --> 30:56.233
Foster Joe Gammon.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.324
But why was he called Oyster Joe?

30:59.344 --> 31:03.210
Well he was spent up in his nature.

31:04.212 --> 31:10.041
He'd take his ancient house and spit his ancient pocket.

31:10.082 --> 31:11.123
Any others?

31:13.187 --> 31:14.449
What about in business?
