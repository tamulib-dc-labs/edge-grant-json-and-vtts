WEBVTT

00:03.659 --> 00:05.901
for high achieving kids.

00:07.382 --> 00:26.799
But I have always felt that one of the things that has endeared many an Aggie to A&M is because he or she got a scholarship based on their need for financial aid as much as anything else.

00:26.819 --> 00:33.565
I would like to see the students know

00:34.237 --> 00:39.867
that received the scholarship, where it came from, and hope to encourage them to put something back.

00:41.550 --> 00:54.112
And I guess as much as anything else, one of my heroes through the years at A&M was an old gentleman by the name of James M. Kopp Forsyte, class of 12.

00:55.895 --> 00:59.181
And Kopp had this unique facility

01:00.106 --> 01:02.769
of seeing life for what it is.

01:03.189 --> 01:05.011
He got his degree in mechanical engineering.

01:06.433 --> 01:10.557
He often said, I had a father that wanted us to have an education.

01:10.577 --> 01:12.740
So he and his three brothers all went to A&M.

01:14.241 --> 01:22.490
But when he was approached to give something back, he was willing and ready and able.

01:23.652 --> 01:25.894
And his philosophy was

01:26.093 --> 01:30.779
I think all of us took more from A&M than we'll ever give back.

01:32.021 --> 01:34.625
And therefore, it's a privilege for me to give something back.

01:36.227 --> 01:39.371
And I've always admired that attitude.

01:43.617 --> 01:44.899
Two questions left then.

01:46.901 --> 01:50.987
What has it meant to you, your life, that you attended Texas A&M?

01:54.882 --> 02:13.963
Well, the mere fact that I might not have even gone to college is a very important factor, but the fact that I came to Texas A&M, I still reflect on the fact that Aggies are different.

02:15.966 --> 02:22.493
And I think we are so different and we're so committed to each other

02:23.873 --> 02:26.837
that we are the envy of people everywhere.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.762
And that's a feeling I like.

02:32.606 --> 02:41.379
When I tell people I went to Texas A&M, I say it with a great deal of pride because I think being an Aggie is very special.

02:42.701 --> 02:49.932
And it's one of those special things that more people than not don't understand, but they appreciate.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.447
I just thought of this question.

02:54.609 --> 03:06.347
If all the people from your days at A&M were available, which ones would you most want to express personal appreciation to?

03:11.755 --> 03:17.083
Well, probably Don McGinty.

03:18.143 --> 03:25.072
as much as anybody because he was the guy that got me here through Mrs. Johnston.

03:26.354 --> 03:28.717
He was the guy that was my freshman roommate.

03:31.701 --> 03:44.678
We just, you know, reinforced each other a lot because I'm here to tell you your freshman year that first semester there is a great tendency to want to be a quitter and just say I'm going to chunk this thing and go home.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.083
But Don had that

03:48.940 --> 03:52.144
tenacious spirit about him that said, I'm here to stay.

03:52.184 --> 03:56.990
I've got a four-year scholarship, and I'm not about to leave, and Walker, you're not leaving either.

03:58.311 --> 04:00.214
And that was always very encouraging to me.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.778
Who else?

04:06.742 --> 04:17.715
I enjoyed Sid Allen, who was a vet student from, he was Austin originally, but

04:18.455 --> 04:25.443
We got acquainted at church, and he wound up really being one of my best friends.

04:26.425 --> 04:34.154
He was best man at our wedding, and our oldest son, his name's Sidney Alan Walker, because of him.

04:35.195 --> 04:42.263
And while he was not in the Corps, he had that Aggie spirit and remains one of my best friends today.

04:43.745 --> 04:46.048
All right, now you didn't name any faculty and staff.

04:46.450 --> 04:53.778
Well, now faculty and staff, I still want to reflect back on people like Herb Thompson.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.662
He was a great, great mentor.

04:58.603 --> 05:12.137
And then the man from basic division that I mentioned, I can't even say his name.

05:12.623 --> 05:13.704
We'll get it later.

05:13.724 --> 05:14.085
We'll get it.

05:14.745 --> 05:18.170
But the people in basic division were good.

05:18.930 --> 05:26.459
I also remember a Major Palmer that was attack officer in our dorm, Air Force.

05:27.520 --> 05:32.366
And he would sit with us at night down in the student lounge and talk.

05:33.888 --> 05:37.332
And he was a psychologist by training.

05:38.054 --> 05:41.217
didn't realize how much good he was doing us at the time.

05:41.818 --> 05:45.762
Cliff Ranstle was the other guy I was trying to remember in basic division that was so good to me.

05:46.903 --> 05:52.848
But Major Palmer was one of those kind of individuals that if you had a problem, you'd go to it.

05:53.789 --> 05:57.753
And he was a real mentor for us, for me.

06:00.436 --> 06:01.097
A trivia one.

06:01.777 --> 06:06.121
Were you acquainted with an undergraduate colleague named Ray Bowen?

06:06.702 --> 06:07.723
Yes, I was.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.737
What was he like as a fellow student?

06:10.757 --> 06:14.201
Ray Boyne was pretty corps happy.

06:14.221 --> 06:16.204
He was on corps staff.

06:16.224 --> 06:24.915
I remember even as a freshman when I did know him, he seemed to be a little more committed to military rigors than I was.

06:25.356 --> 06:26.577
I was just having a good time.

06:27.479 --> 06:31.183
But he proceeded on and became deputy corps commander.

06:32.105 --> 06:36.951
And, but I still remember him as a very dignified,

06:37.707 --> 07:05.453
serious cadet and I wasn't quite that I wasn't quite that dignified and that serious let's have we left any what what other topics have we not touched that you might have thought about before we began my last question then is what feelings do you hold in your heart now for Texas A&M

07:09.466 --> 07:19.722
Well, one of the feelings, Haskell, that you have is that you wish in a way the place wasn't so big.

07:22.065 --> 07:29.837
And you wished it was a little more family closeness where you could know more students, be more involved.

07:30.745 --> 07:39.498
But the truth of the matter is when I interact with students today, I find them to be very much like we were when we were students.

07:40.720 --> 07:46.990
And they're good kids, and they come from good families, and they believe in hard work.

07:47.631 --> 07:49.594
They believe in being honest.

07:50.695 --> 07:54.441
And whether it's the guys or the gals, when I visit with them,

07:55.349 --> 07:59.013
I work with a number of committees, the Muster Selection Committee every year.

07:59.053 --> 08:04.779
I deal with them, get to know some of them, some of the student leaders, core leaders.

08:06.441 --> 08:07.922
By and large, they're just good kids.

08:09.243 --> 08:16.771
I think one of the things we miss is we don't have as many living on campus as we used to.

08:16.811 --> 08:25.120
And the atmosphere at A&M, a lot of it's created by living on campus.

08:27.023 --> 08:36.300
It becomes a little less involved, you might say, and there's not as much participation in a lot of things.

08:38.264 --> 08:44.796
And I shouldn't say this, but it's what I believe in my heart.

08:45.485 --> 09:00.462
I think we've become a little more fragmented because of various organizations, fraternities and sororities, and the day was you were an Aggie and that's all there was to it.

09:00.763 --> 09:02.865
Now is that to say they're second-class citizens?

09:02.985 --> 09:04.046
No, I'm not saying that.

09:04.967 --> 09:15.019
But I'm saying their loyalty is to the smaller group, just like my loyalty was to the Squadron 4 group that I lived with, and I know.

09:15.843 --> 09:32.369
We had our 40th class reunion recently, and I had three of my four roommates back, and we just had a blast together.

09:34.072 --> 09:36.536
Some of what you said was true.

09:37.537 --> 09:39.620
Some of the stories you remembered were factual.

09:39.761 --> 09:40.181
Oh, yes.

09:40.261 --> 09:41.363
There were some other memories.

09:41.383 --> 09:41.884
Oh, yes.

09:42.370 --> 09:48.182
When we got together and started talking, there's a lot of things that we have different opinions on.

09:48.202 --> 09:54.776
But still, that's the one regret you have.

09:54.817 --> 10:02.573
Because when you've got 43,000 students, 36,000 undergraduates or so,

10:03.245 --> 10:07.690
It is difficult to be as involved as we were.

10:08.391 --> 10:11.114
Now, I may have given you the wrong impression on that question.

10:11.154 --> 10:18.183
What I was really attempting to ask is today, how do you feel, what are your feelings for A&M?

10:18.603 --> 10:18.703
Oh.

10:20.165 --> 10:23.569
Well, my feelings today for A&M are stronger than ever.

10:25.692 --> 10:31.058
And I really believe that this place,

10:32.084 --> 10:36.208
has a uniqueness about it that you don't find anywhere else.

10:38.211 --> 10:51.305
I am grieved, as many are, by the fact that we have so many students who want to be Aggies and we don't have room for them.

10:51.325 --> 11:01.956
And yet, if we get bigger and bigger and bigger, we're going to have, we run the risk of losing some of that Aggie spirit because we just become a factory.

11:02.965 --> 11:06.009
And how much bigger can you get and keep it, I don't know.

11:07.110 --> 11:14.518
But sometimes we, in life, say, well, the bigger something is, the better it is.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.364
I'm not sure that's true of an academic institution.

11:20.205 --> 11:24.630
I think you begin to have diminishing returns on quality if you get too big.

11:25.671 --> 11:27.994
And there's a tendency to be a number rather than a name.
