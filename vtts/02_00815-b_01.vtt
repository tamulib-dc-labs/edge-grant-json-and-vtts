00:02.258 --> 00:17.776
By early 1967, it was well known that the state 
representative for the local legislative

00:02.258 --> 00:17.776
district made up of Brazos, Grimes, and Madison 
counties would not be a candidate for reelection.

00:17.796 --> 00:24.985
He had moved out of the district and taken a job in 
Baytown, Texas. Shortly after his announcement,

00:25.005 --> 00:30.932
my oldest brother began to discuss with me the 
possibilities of my making the race for state

00:31.722 --> 00:35.448
representative. I had never given any thought at 
all until he mentioned the possibility. He began

00:44.982 --> 00:50.791
to explain to me the roles and duties of state 
representative, how much time it took, et cetera.

00:52.754 --> 00:55.719
The more I thought about it, the more interested I 
became. I had campaigned for my cousin in 1962 and

01:01.523 --> 01:09.092
had gotten a feel for what it was like to conduct a 
campaign back in those days. I had not been able to

01:11.014 --> 01:26.432
increase my farm operation to the point that it 
occupied all of my time, so it did fit into the

01:11.014 --> 01:26.432
scheme of things for me to think about making the 
race. One of the things that I wanted to do was stay

01:28.234 --> 01:30.957
on the payroll at Texas A&M as long as I could 
because I needed the cash flow. So I decided to not

01:40.030 --> 01:55.290
make an announcement until after the first of the 
year since when I did make an announcement, I would

01:40.030 --> 01:55.290
have to leave employment at Texas A&M. I checked on 
the policy regulations of the A&M system and found

01:55.996 --> 02:14.946
that once you announced for a public office, you 
had to leave employment or resign your position.

02:14.966 --> 02:18.211
So for that reason, I held off as long as I possibly 
could. In the meantime, in November of that year, a

02:22.962 --> 02:35.500
city councilman from Madisonville announced for 
state representative, and he was way ahead of any

02:22.962 --> 02:35.500
other announcements for the position. I did feel a 
little pressure to let more and more people know

02:35.520 --> 02:52.243
that I planned to run, but I did not want to get out 
front too much simply because of the policy of the

02:35.520 --> 02:52.243
inning system. In 1968, about mid-January, I 
resigned my position at A&M and made my

02:54.552 --> 03:11.027
announcement that I would be a candidate for state 
representative. Shortly after making that

03:11.047 --> 03:23.378
announcement, I was visited in my office by a 
student who represented the Young Democrats. He

03:24.455 --> 03:31.764
proceeded to interview me and ask a lot of 
questions, mainly regarding my political

03:24.455 --> 03:31.764
philosophy. And shortly after he left, it wasn't 
too long until I had, there was another person

03:33.546 --> 03:46.763
joined the race, the president of the Texas A&M 
Young Democrats. He would become the liberal in

03:48.425 --> 03:53.331
the race for state representatives. A fourth 
candidate announced and filed just before the

03:54.948 --> 04:02.336
filing deadline. He was a resident of Bryan and a 
chiropractor.

04:09.263 --> 04:23.098
So we had a dairy farmer, myself, a city councilman 
from Madisonville, a young Democrat, and a

04:09.263 --> 04:23.098
chiropractor in the race for state 
representative. We all ran as Democrats because

04:24.530 --> 04:38.125
there was very little

04:24.530 --> 04:38.125
activity in the Republican Party at that time. In 
fact, as I recall, there were less than 200 votes

04:38.726 --> 04:45.213
cast that year in the Republican primary. The only 
interest was in the statewide races, and

04:46.234 --> 04:53.102
therefore,

04:54.618 --> 05:00.227
Few votes were cast in that particular primary. 
Quite a change from what we have today. One of the

05:05.476 --> 05:20.541
things I felt like I needed to do early was to 
establish a campaign office so that I had some

05:05.476 --> 05:20.541
visibility in the city of Bryan, which was the 
largest voting block in the district.

05:23.812 --> 05:33.146
I was fortunate to locate a vacant office by a good 
friend, Dr. Howard Cargill, who was a

05:23.812 --> 05:33.146
veterinarian. He had built a new office next door 
and vacated the space that I used as a campaign

05:34.228 --> 05:43.962
office. This was on Texas Avenue and had great 
visibility between Bryan and College Station.

05:51.757 --> 05:56.281
there in the main thoroughfare. One of the things I 
did in the office early on was to play around with

05:56.301 --> 06:02.608
making some political science. I tried to make 
them by hand but found out very quickly that that

06:03.769 --> 06:12.818
was not very productive. In the meantime I learned 
a little bit about silk screening and got some

06:12.838 --> 06:20.245
friends together and we made some 4x8 signs that 
were made with a silk screen. At that time, no one

06:27.753 --> 06:37.363
had attempted to make sentinel signs, and no one 
had put up a 4x8 sign on vacant property. But we

06:38.925 --> 06:48.055
found these to be quite effective, particularly 
since other candidates were not using them back in

06:38.925 --> 06:48.055
1968. I really didn't know how I was going to get my 
campaign started and what would be starting it,

06:49.435 --> 07:19.273
but fortunately I had a visit with a bank president

06:49.435 --> 07:19.273
and he told me that for the first time in history 
their bank, which was also the place where I

06:49.435 --> 07:19.273
banked, was going to get involved in politics. 
They had decided to support me in my race, and this

07:19.642 --> 07:30.651
would be the first time that they had ever 
supported a candidate openly for any public

07:19.642 --> 07:30.651
office. I was delighted because I knew the people 
and had a high regard for all of the officers in that

07:32.012 --> 07:39.899
particular bank.

07:43.602 --> 07:49.547
One of the things that I suggested to the president 
is that I needed a finance chairman and asked if his

07:50.287 --> 07:59.516
executive vice president could serve in that 
position. He said it would be strictly up to him and

08:00.437 --> 08:03.740
I should ask him. I did ask the executive vice 
president if he would be willing to serve and he

08:04.701 --> 08:10.166
said yes. As soon as the word got out that he was 
serving as my finance chairman, The competing

08:16.966 --> 08:34.205
bank and the largest bank in the bank was not happy 
at all and told me that I was making a big mistake and

08:16.966 --> 08:34.205
that I needed to find someone else to serve as my 
finance chairman. I was concerned about this and

08:34.225 --> 08:37.669
didn't know which way to turn. So I finally decided 
to go discuss it with the state senator at that time

08:45.907 --> 08:49.430
lived in Brian and get his views. He had been in the 
Senate for a long time and I felt like that at least

08:50.471 --> 09:00.401
give me some advice on explaining the situation to 
him. He related a story to me about people that are

09:01.402 --> 09:15.475
person that had supported him that everyone said 
that he would be better off if he did not campaign

09:01.402 --> 09:15.475
for me. But he said, I decided a long time ago that if 
somebody wanted to work for me, I was going to let

09:16.771 --> 09:28.669
them, regardless of their character or whatever. 
I did not have a problem with the character of the

09:28.689 --> 09:32.575
individual. He was certainly one of the most 
respected men in the town, and so that answered my

09:33.196 --> 09:40.888
question. I went back and told the person that he 
was still my finance chairman and that that was the

09:45.593 --> 09:59.453
end of any discussion with regards to replacing 
him as my finance chairman. Early in the campaign I

10:00.995 --> 10:06.863
made two trips outside of my legislative 
district. One was with my brother who lived in

10:07.063 --> 10:11.770
Austin. and who took a day and went around to the 
offices of those executive directors of trade

10:12.948 --> 10:28.050
associations and some of the so-called lobbyists 
in Austin. This was very productive. They had a lot

10:29.452 --> 10:41.470
of contacts back in the district and traveled in 
and out of the district and had a good ear for what

10:29.452 --> 10:41.470
was going on and what might occur. In fact, one of 
the lobbyists agreed to have a person on his staff

10:42.648 --> 10:59.548
come into the district and find out what the 
strategy might be of my opposition.

11:02.131 --> 11:11.001
It developed from that swing through the district 
that the assessment of the race was that I was

11:11.808 --> 11:30.433
probably the leading candidate in the race, and my 
principal opposition would be from the city

11:11.808 --> 11:30.433
councilman from Madisonville, who had good 
contacts into Brazos County and expected to carry

11:11.808 --> 11:30.433
the other two counties. By that combination, I had 
a chance of winning the race. Knowing this helped

11:37.523 --> 11:40.026
some because I could plan some strategy and did not 
want to depend strictly upon Braggers County to

11:40.377 --> 11:51.572
win the race. On the other hand, I felt like that 
Braggers County would be my strength, along with

11:52.714 --> 12:04.851
getting a significant vote out of Grimes County. I 
did not expect to carry Grimes County, but I knew I

12:04.871 --> 12:08.055
had a lot of friends who were in the dairy business 
in that county and thought I could depend on

12:08.390 --> 12:17.343
getting a rather significant vote there. In the 
meantime, some very good things happened. I had a

12:21.309 --> 12:34.768
friend who lived down the street who was in the 
labor movement and was able to help me not only try

12:21.309 --> 12:34.768
to neutralize the small labor movement that that 
was in Brazos County but also had access to the

12:35.356 --> 12:54.417
minority community and was very helpful there in 
getting me in touch and giving me good

12:35.356 --> 12:54.417
recommendations with the minority leadership.

12:54.437 --> 13:02.005
My father enjoyed campaigning and it turned out 
that he also knew a lot of people in the minority

13:02.575 --> 13:22.373
community because of his background of running a 
country store where many of the minority families

13:02.575 --> 13:22.373
had been sharecroppers on the land that my 
grandfather owned. Of course, these were

13:22.393 --> 13:32.042
children of those people that had sharecropped in 
many cases, but they still remembered coming to

13:22.393 --> 13:32.042
the store and my father's kindness toward them. I 
knew from the outset that the young Democrat

13:36.747 --> 13:52.648
candidate would be working the minorities very 
vigorously and would be expected to get a good

13:36.747 --> 13:52.648
vote. But I also wanted to make a showing in that 
community as well as carrying the vote on the other

13:59.967 --> 14:04.633
side of Texas. I knew that Madison County had to be 
conceded to the local candidate who was a city

14:06.736 --> 14:18.333
councilman and very popular in that county. The 
biggest surprise to many in the first primary was

14:20.035 --> 14:27.325
the vote that I got in Grimes County. I carried the 
county along with Brazos County and liked only 67

14:29.313 --> 14:41.107
votes winning over three candidates without a 
runoff. This was a surprise to everyone as to the

14:41.127 --> 14:46.653
strength that I showed. The runoff was a breeze 
with that kind of lead, but I decided not to take it

14:48.435 --> 14:56.805
for granted and continued work for the next three 
weeks so that I would get a significant vote and

14:57.241 --> 15:06.490
margin in the runoff election. This was the only 
time in my 15 years in the legislature and eight

15:07.091 --> 15:17.962
races that I had that I ever had to make a runoff. 
This one was easy, but so many times runoffs are not

15:17.982 --> 15:26.691
much fun because it's hard to get people back out to 
the polls for the second time. As near as I could

15:27.650 --> 15:31.936
determine, I spent about $3,500 on the race. This 
was money that I didn't have with the exception of

15:32.597 --> 15:42.671
about $1,600 that I cashed out of my retirement at 
Texas A&M. Most of the balance I was able to raise

15:44.935 --> 15:55.750
from small contributions locally through my 
finance chairman and some contributions from the

15:56.202 --> 15:58.245
lobby in Austin. I did come up $600 short for a bill 
that I owed in Austin to a printing shop. And

16:07.638 --> 16:15.990
fortunately,

16:07.638 --> 16:15.990
some members of the lobby in Austin agreed to pick 
up the tab on that. Back then, the finance laws for

16:17.172 --> 16:25.804
financing campaigns was much more lenient and 
much more flexible than they are today.

16:34.385 --> 16:40.511
It never occurred to me that I might have to go into 
debt during the campaign. If I had thought about

16:41.152 --> 16:47.398
running up debt to make the race, I probably would 
have decided not to run. Shortly after the runoff

16:48.979 --> 16:55.285
election, I decided that I would see if I could go 
back to work at Texas A&M at least for a few months

16:55.467 --> 17:03.857
since I was no longer a candidate that had 
opposition. I didn't know what the rules might be,

17:05.579 --> 17:24.681
but I contacted

17:05.579 --> 17:24.681
my cohort, who was the legislative person for the 
A&M system, and asked him what the rules might be.

17:26.247 --> 17:37.600
He said he could find no reason why that I could not 
come back to work, particularly since my job

17:26.247 --> 17:37.600
position was still open and the office of the 
commandant. I assumed my old position in office

17:37.620 --> 17:51.336
for about three days, and on the third day I got a 
call to come to the President Rutter's office. I

17:52.998 --> 17:54.840
phoned visiting the President Rutter. He 
suggested that I moved to the budget office down

17:56.707 --> 18:11.741
the hallway from his office, and that he would like 
to switch me to a private payroll if that was okay

17:56.707 --> 18:11.741
with him, with me. And I said that was certainly 
fine. I had no problem with that at all. This was a,

18:16.945 --> 18:25.313
turned out to be a fortunate

18:16.945 --> 18:25.313
happening. because I was put on the payroll of the 
Texas A&M Research Foundation. And years later,

18:31.523 --> 18:44.316
when I was working at the Research Foundation and 
subsequently resigned, I had just enough time to

18:31.523 --> 18:44.316
invest in their particular retirement program. 
During that six-month period that I was down the

18:45.077 --> 18:53.325
hallway from President Rutter, I sat through the 
budget reviews and in preparation for the

18:54.031 --> 19:07.870
legislative session and was certainly an 
education to me as to how the budget process works.

19:11.676 --> 19:23.532
I also got a close-up of how President Rutter 
conducted himself as president of the

19:11.676 --> 19:23.532
institution and was quite impressed with a person 
who showed great leadership ability. And I think

19:30.028 --> 19:45.098
some of the traits that I found that he had made an 
impression upon me and hope that they help me in my

19:30.028 --> 19:45.098
decision-making later in my legislative years. 
I'm sure that somewhere in the process that Mr.

19:46.647 --> 20:01.812
Rutter had also indicated to the Speaker of the 
House to me, Gus Mutcher, that it would be good if I

19:46.647 --> 20:01.812
served on the Appropriations Committee. And 
President Rutter made it a point to suggest to me

20:03.595 --> 20:12.891
that I should ask for that committee. I did ask for 
the committee and was one of the four freshmen

20:13.934 --> 20:23.328
appointed to the committee when the session 
convened in 1969. January 1969 was a memorable

20:23.669 --> 20:39.452
experience as I joined the legislature and began 
serving as a freshman state representative.

20:42.149 --> 20:46.815
Gus Mutcher of Brenham was elected without 
opposition as Speaker of the House. Previous to

20:48.317 --> 21:07.743
his election, Ben Barnes had been Speaker, but had 
since been elected Lieutenant Governor and had

20:48.317 --> 21:07.743
moved over as Presiding Officer of the Texas 
Senate.

21:07.763 --> 21:10.907
Governor Preston Smith was the new Governor. So 
all three of the principals, Mutcher, Barnes, and

21:11.461 --> 21:22.137
Smith, were new in their jobs, just as I was. I spent 
much of the session viewing budgets and reviewing

21:23.719 --> 21:36.979
budgets and trying to assist with the Texas A&M 
appropriations in any way that I could. I found

21:38.107 --> 21:45.075
early that the process was quite different than 
you might expect. The chairman of the House

21:46.176 --> 21:51.061
Appropriations Committee was a very strong 
individual. He had a very strong personality and

21:52.002 --> 22:06.358
could be and had been

21:52.002 --> 22:06.358
described as a dictator. I learned to appreciate 
the man over a period of years that I served with him

22:08.482 --> 22:31.705
and found that he was sometimes

22:08.482 --> 22:31.705
very difficult, but I suspect that he was this way 
to cover up a rather tender heart that he had

22:08.482 --> 22:31.705
underneath. I carried a few bills that session, 
but did have two that was of interest to Texas A&M.

22:40.897 --> 22:54.670
One of the things we were trying to do in Brazos 
County at the time was to find some land for

22:40.897 --> 22:54.670
industrial development and bring in some 
industry into the county. Up until that time, we

22:55.150 --> 23:00.055
were very agriculturally oriented and had a 
university that had a rather small enrollment at

23:00.676 --> 23:06.584
that time.

23:11.411 --> 23:22.326
President Rutter had suggested that property at 
Bryan Air Force Base could be made available with

23:11.411 --> 23:22.326
the legislature's approval. So we sought to get 
legislative approval for the transfer exchange

23:29.093 --> 23:37.902
of property that was under the control of Texas A&M 
during the legislative session in 1969.

23:39.984 --> 23:52.476
We were able to get legislation passed, but at the 
last minute the bill was amended to exempt the main

23:39.984 --> 23:52.476
campus. The reason that was put in the bill was to 
avoid any attempt through political pressure of a

23:58.490 --> 24:08.463
corporation building a hotel on the campus. There 
was some discussion about a hotel being built on

24:08.824 --> 24:24.244
the campus and the Board of Regents of the Texas A&M 
University System did not want the pressure of

24:08.824 --> 24:24.244
making that decision. The bill was amended to say 
that you have to come back to the legislature to get

24:25.540 --> 24:39.516
approval to build a building

24:25.540 --> 24:39.516
by private enterprise on the main campus. Another 
problem at that time was to develop more of an

24:40.758 --> 24:50.148
airport facility than the county had. The city of 
Bryan had a small airport, which was inadequate.

24:55.122 --> 24:59.986
The primary facility was owned by Texas A&M 
University. Texas A&M did not have the resources

25:01.828 --> 25:23.307
to develop the airport as it should be, so after 
looking at various possibilities and

25:01.828 --> 25:23.307
alternatives, I introduced a bill that would 
allow the county to create a an airport authority

25:23.978 --> 25:37.852
and manage or control the airport at Eastwood, but 
be under the management of Texas A&M. This would

25:39.193 --> 25:47.682
allow public funds to be funneled to the airport 
through the airport authority, which would have

25:39.193 --> 25:47.682
taxing authority. The bill passed rather easily. 
But when the election was held, it was defeated

25:52.717 --> 25:58.083
rather resoundingly.

25:59.405 --> 26:21.171
The problem the bill had was that it provided that 
the airport authority could impose a tax of $0.50

25:59.405 --> 26:21.171
on $100 evaluation, which was many times more 
money than would ever be required to operate an

25:59.405 --> 26:21.171
airport.

26:22.602 --> 26:32.971
The bill has never been amended, but it's still on 
the books and does provide that possibility

26:22.602 --> 26:32.971
sometime in the future. But because it lost so 
badly, when it was first initiated back in 1969, it

26:32.991 --> 26:52.288
has never been used as a vehicle to develop the 
airport facility here in Brazos County, which is

26:32.991 --> 26:52.288
still to this day needed and could be a great boon to 
economic development. There were a number of

26:59.257 --> 27:08.690
other issues that come to mind that were before the 
legislature in 1969. One of the early votes taken

27:08.971 --> 27:15.340
was on creation of University of Texas at Dallas. 
Until that time, that campus had been a private

27:16.282 --> 27:26.936
research institute, and the vote would make it a 
part of the University of Texas system. I had been

27:28.458 --> 27:43.639
privately advised by a Dallasite that this was not 
a good concept and would end up costing the state

27:28.458 --> 27:43.639
considerably, and so I voted against it. There 
were only 19 votes cast against the proposal, and I

27:44.783 --> 27:59.665
found out very quickly that the Dallas delegation

27:44.783 --> 27:59.665
could be pretty intimidating.

28:00.206 --> 28:14.487
I never did know of them to carry out any threats, 
but there were certainly threats made after I cast

28:00.206 --> 28:14.487
that vote, even though it was overwhelmingly 
passed in the House. Another bill that the speaker

28:16.255 --> 28:21.622
was particularly interested in passing was 
liquor by the drink. And I had taken a position

28:22.864 --> 28:35.982
against liquor by the drink during the campaign in 
1968 and was not about to change my position.

28:37.965 --> 28:42.291
However, the pressure from the speaker can be 
rather significant. But I found later that we may

28:45.567 --> 28:52.394
have become good friends because of standing up to 
that pressure. You never know. I'm sure that at the

28:54.296 --> 29:04.627
time the vote was cast, he was delighted to have my 
vote. But on the other hand, there are many times,

29:04.827 --> 29:14.477
as always true in the legislature and serving in 
the legislature, there's always a tomorrow. And

29:15.183 --> 29:25.459
there were a lot of tomorrows in dealing with this 
speaker who I developed a rather good

29:15.183 --> 29:25.459
relationship with. In a special session

29:27.422 --> 29:43.907
later that year, there was a bill to create a 
private insurance in lieu of the federal Deposit

29:44.630 --> 29:48.074
Insurance Corporation, the FDIC. This bill 
became known as one of the Sharkstown bills. It

29:54.803 --> 30:08.520
passed without little opposition at the time and

29:54.803 --> 30:08.520
reached the governor's desk and was vetoed. Even 
though the bill was vetoed, a great deal was made of

30:08.540 --> 30:14.367
the Sharkstown bills, a lot of a little later, in 
fact, at the beginning of the next session, and

30:14.498 --> 30:26.855
created the Sharpstown scandal, which I will 
discuss later. Another issue that occupied a

30:27.856 --> 30:41.434
great deal of my time in the interim was a proposal 
by a colleague to create a school of oceanography

30:27.856 --> 30:41.434
at the University of Houston. I was not aware of 
this, but at that time, Texas A&M was producing

30:42.697 --> 30:54.029
almost 50% of all of the oceanography PhDs in the 
world. And there was no undergraduate school of

30:55.470 --> 31:03.218
oceanography with the exception of one in the 
state of Washington in the entire nation. The

31:04.740 --> 31:10.105
administration at Texas A&M felt like that it was 
not called for and that it would be inappropriate

31:10.996 --> 31:19.706
to have a school of oceanography anywhere except 
at the graduate level. And we were already turning

31:20.727 --> 31:27.634
out more than our share of oceanographers here at 
Texas A&M. And the state did not need another

31:29.556 --> 31:33.481
school of oceanography anywhere. It also turned 
out that the author of the bill was close to my

31:41.624 --> 31:53.861
cousin who had run for lieutenant governor and had 
become a political influence in Parrish County

31:41.624 --> 31:53.861
even though he had been defeated. And I recall his

31:55.443 --> 32:10.163
coming to Austin and telling the state 
representative in no uncertain terms that he was

31:55.443 --> 32:10.163
not to push that bell, just let it drop. He did let 
the bell drop but was interested in pursuing it

32:14.210 --> 32:32.413
during the interim and got an interim committee 
appointed and I got appointed as one of the

32:14.210 --> 32:32.413
committee members to study in more detail what was 
needed in the area of oceanography and marine

32:14.210 --> 32:32.413
studies. This led to some very interesting trips 
that were made to oceanographic institutes such

32:39.337 --> 32:55.297
as Scripps, Woods Hole, the University of 
Washington where they had the only undergraduate

32:39.337 --> 32:55.297
school of oceanography, and several other stops 
along the way. I think that after the visits it

32:56.899 --> 33:08.314
became clear that we had no particular need for 
expanding the educational programs in Texas with

33:09.020 --> 33:23.919
regards to oceanography, but did need to do 
something with the large to research along the

33:09.020 --> 33:23.919
coast. This led to...
