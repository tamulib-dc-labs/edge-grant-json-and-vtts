WEBVTT

00:04.132 --> 00:06.778
Here's the list of stuff. So what do you think about 
the topics I mentioned?

00:15.878 --> 00:17.021
What was this item here? Killer asteroids and 
comets. Oh, yes, that's right. Killer asteroids

00:19.126 --> 00:21.010
and comets. Well, I'm just a bystander in all those 
subjects. I'm just a professional who can... But

00:28.561 --> 00:31.125
you're a taxpayer, and you know something about 
the subject. Well, I'm a taxpayer in that sense,

00:31.145 --> 00:35.711
and I know something about the subject. As a 
trained professional, a physics person,

00:35.792 --> 00:45.986
astronomy person, computing person, I'm 
certainly highly entitled to have an opinion, an

00:35.792 --> 00:45.986
informed opinion. My own opinion is that the 
current budget level applied into the SETI,

00:46.928 --> 00:51.334
which... what is it, 12 million a year or 
something, 15 million a year, is about right. So I

00:57.135 --> 01:06.268
personally, were I sitting on a congressional 
committee, I would authorize the current efforts

00:57.135 --> 01:06.268
at roughly the current levels within factor of 
two. I mean, I think maybe 20 million is an

01:06.408 --> 01:10.794
appropriate number instead of 10. But, yeah, 
right in that ballpark. I wouldn't put 100 million

01:12.797 --> 01:15.161
into it. I wouldn't put a billion into it yet, not 
now. In fact, my own private odds calculation is

01:18.888 --> 01:22.956
it's going to fail. It's not going to find 
anything. But it's a part of our ancient

01:25.821 --> 01:31.873
tradition, the search tradition, the research 
tradition. It's a part of an ultimate human

01:32.073 --> 01:34.658
question. And one of our goals as astronomers is to 
face up to these ultimate questions that are

01:37.113 --> 01:48.927
outside the mundane existence that we... Those 
words that I'm using there sound almost

01:37.113 --> 01:48.927
religious, and I don't think that's an accident. 
One of the reasons to gravitate to cosmology, for

01:49.728 --> 02:07.069
example, is the facing up to the ultimate 
cosmogonical questions, etiology and

01:49.728 --> 02:07.069
eschatology of all of existence, the where did we 
come from questions, the ultimate...

02:07.201 --> 02:08.503
existential questions. Well, SETI research is 
also in the category of ultimate existential

02:08.563 --> 02:14.433
questions. And that is, I think, the real 
justification for doing it. And whether or not it

02:19.903 --> 02:22.728
succeeds is sort of irrelevant. The doing of it is 
what's really important. So my reaction is about

02:25.492 --> 02:29.479
the current funding level is about right. And it 
should be carried on probably forever. It should

02:32.455 --> 02:39.944
be acknowledged to be one of those things that 
human beings ought to be doing just because it's an

02:32.455 --> 02:39.944
ultimate ideological question. Now, killer 
asteroids are in a different category. That's a

02:43.808 --> 02:45.771
straightforward, practical question. No 
philosophy, no religiosity. It's what's the odds

02:48.614 --> 02:51.197
they're going to hit us. And it's also a kind of 
geological question because geologists would

02:52.198 --> 02:59.787
like to know how much has the Earth been pounded 
into smithereens. and 65 million years ago kind of

03:00.121 --> 03:03.205
questions.

03:05.748 --> 03:10.775
So I think that's perfectly reasonable to put 
money into, and probably the current funding

03:05.748 --> 03:10.775
levels are about right. Other solar systems. 
Well, that's... If you're into planetary

03:18.606 --> 03:26.756
science, you'd sure like to know just what are 
the... How unusual is our planetary system?

03:27.237 --> 03:28.018
Being... or we say Copernicans philosophically. 
We've been trained to think that we shouldn't

03:31.696 --> 03:36.662
really be in a unique preferred position. But it's 
hard to tell when you only have one attitude.

03:39.745 --> 03:41.868
That's right. Well, once again, you see, my own 
attitudes are really much broader than the narrow

03:41.888 --> 03:50.197
professional interests that I officially did. 
But I have to say that while I was a grad student, I

03:54.121 --> 03:59.188
hadn't really developed my own philosophical 
attitudes about these matters. I couldn't have

03:59.268 --> 04:02.092
expressed such opinions very well in those days. 
But over the last 25 years or so, I gradually, since

04:03.453 --> 04:15.649
I moved to a lot of institutions, read a lot of 
journals, thought about it a lot, I developed a

04:03.453 --> 04:15.649
broader view of what is science, what is 
astronomy, and why are we doing it. What do you

04:15.749 --> 04:19.635
think astronomy's position is today? I mean, are 
we at a plateau? Are we sinking or what? These are

04:23.838 --> 04:25.541
the glory days of astronomy. We are lucky to be in 
this generation. We are living through the golden

04:29.609 --> 04:33.015
years of astronomy. I would say these years 
correspond logically to being a physicist in the

04:33.296 --> 04:41.451
20s, being a physicist in the 30s. This is sort of 
like 1930 for physics. Those were incredible

04:44.628 --> 04:49.192
years when all kinds of new instruments came 
online. You just think about it. In the 30s, there

04:50.233 --> 04:52.636
was Lawrence building cyclotrons. Right here, 
yes. Yeah, right here, yes. And

04:56.780 --> 05:04.948
you had just finished up Rutherford, you know, and 
you were right in the midst of trying to understand

04:56.780 --> 05:04.948
quantum mechanics. Well, right now, we are 
covering the entire frequency spectrum of

05:05.008 --> 05:14.517
photons that come to us from the universe here in 
this meeting of the AAS. We have every kind of

05:14.851 --> 05:26.930
photon that gets to us from the universe is being 
discussed in the oral sessions or in the poster

05:14.851 --> 05:26.930
papers, and that's incredible. When I was a grad 
student, when I entered graduate school in 1964,

05:27.030 --> 05:32.719
this was absolutely not true. Radios... And radio 
was puny. It was pitiful. Radio was meter

05:37.612 --> 05:40.581
wavelength, or just getting in the centimeter 
wavelength. Not only that, but the

05:40.601 --> 05:44.675
interferometers could only tell you about fringe 
visibilities. They couldn't tell you about a

05:44.735 --> 05:47.203
picture of the sky. Now, 10 years ago, we had the 
VLA, and we could see the sky at one arc second

05:47.470 --> 05:53.016
resolution. That was incredible. When I was a grad 
student, you hadn't yet taken X-ray astronomy

05:55.359 --> 05:59.924
seriously. So during my professional career, 
X-ray astronomy has gone from nothing to being a

06:00.285 --> 06:05.951
booming big deal. Likewise, when I was a grad 
student, infrared detectors were junk. You could

06:11.037 --> 06:13.039
hardly detect anything with them. I mean, they 
were lucky to detect the brightest sources in the

06:13.255 --> 06:18.623
solar system, practically. It was really hard 
work. By the time I... Well, by now, of course, we

06:21.788 --> 06:30.220
have infrared cameras that are almost as good as 
the optical cameras. You know, it can go on and on

06:30.781 --> 06:32.023
and on. We've got gamma rays. We've got a gamma ray 
observatory flying today. We have gamma ray

06:36.269 --> 06:38.373
bursters, which were unknown. Of course, when I 
entered grad school, pulsars hadn't been

06:38.713 --> 06:42.739
discovered. And Martin Schmidt had only 
recognized 3C273 one year before. So you just

06:48.840 --> 06:57.894
think about all the revolutionary things that 
have happened in the last 25 years, and you think

06:48.840 --> 06:57.894
about the last decade from NASA's point of view. 
NASA's contribution of the great observatories,

06:57.934 --> 07:02.702
I think, is a heroic thing. We're not alone in this. 
The other cultures of the world, the Europeans,

07:05.215 --> 07:09.279
Japanese, the Russians, have all been a part of it. 
So the whole frequency spectrum, from the highest

07:09.700 --> 07:15.826
frequencies to the lowest, is now wide open to 
astronomy. There is essentially no phenomenon in

07:16.327 --> 07:20.091
the universe that can hide from us now. There were 
things in the universe that were hidden from us 25

07:22.213 --> 07:25.236
years ago. Star formation. Yeah, well, star 
formation, planetary systems. Let's end this

07:29.767 --> 07:32.991
with one particular question. What's your 
favorite Harlan Smith story?

07:47.407 --> 07:48.208
Hard to choose.

07:54.955 --> 07:57.818
Boy, do I have Harlan Smith stories? I don't know. 
For me, I don't know that I'm good at coming up with

08:00.968 --> 08:07.354
an answer to that kind of question. I was amazed at 
his daring, his ability to promote and get money

08:08.476 --> 08:16.123
for his projects. He had a profound influence on 
me. I'm pretty sure that I got into his department

08:18.225 --> 08:23.991
because of his decision. I think he was the one who, 
in some sense, chose me. I think he hewed me as one of

08:28.496 --> 08:30.958
his proteges. There was a meeting in Europe about 
five years ago, it was only a couple of years before

08:31.276 --> 08:39.485
he died, at which he was speaking. I've forgotten 
what his topic was about. I think it may have been

08:42.968 --> 08:47.733
computer controlled telescopes and instruments 
and information handling or something. He was

08:47.773 --> 08:52.658
kind of brought in to give an overview of current of 
search as seen by an observatory director. And he

08:53.739 --> 08:57.283
saw me in the crowd. And he was saying 
extraordinarily complimentary things about me

08:57.719 --> 09:02.746
and really embarrassed me. And yet, in fact, I was 
so embarrassed I almost couldn't take it

09:03.827 --> 09:08.393
afterwards. I could hardly talk to him about it 
afterwards. And yet, I also realized when I

09:10.857 --> 09:22.933
thought about it later on that this was almost 
quintessential Harlan, that he had picked people

09:10.857 --> 09:22.933
and he had backed them very thoroughly. and that he 
really believed in them even in the face of what

09:23.437 --> 09:37.294
most people, objective observers, would have 
said contrary evidence, that Harlan was a

09:23.437 --> 09:37.294
promoter not just of projects but of people. Is 
that a Harlan story? It's not in your style, Ron.

09:41.018 --> 09:42.039
It's a Harlan story. It is a Harlan story. I've 
gotten similar stories from other people. Right.

09:47.566 --> 09:51.891
And I'm sure that this led to inspiring a fierce 
loyalty in some people In me, it inspired a great

09:52.242 --> 09:58.169
respect for him as a leadership person. And that 
respect grew in my mind over the years as I had

09:58.910 --> 10:20.275
experience in other environments and 
organizations, and I understood the effect that

09:58.910 --> 10:20.275
one person could have, a leadership person, and 
that it was more than just promoting money or being

09:58.910 --> 10:20.275
a leadership person technically, that almost 
more important was the influence on people. that I

10:20.558 --> 10:26.566
have grown in my opinion that people matter more 
than most other things. That was something when I

10:26.646 --> 10:33.595
was a young student, I believed science was all 
logical and mathematical and people weren't the

10:26.646 --> 10:33.595
matter. It was all technology and theory and all 
that. And being much older and much wiser now, I

10:36.820 --> 10:41.706
have a rather different view of the world. And I'm 
much more interested in people. I've got to ask you

10:44.561 --> 10:47.465
this, although it probably won't appear in the 
book. What was your first impression when you

10:47.485 --> 10:52.090
first saw Harlan, the observatory director? Oh, 
my, the flat top. He didn't look like your idea of an

10:55.174 --> 10:59.079
observatory director, did he? No. He didn't act 
like one either. He wore, as I recall, he generally

11:01.662 --> 11:08.250
had a bolo tie like yours, your Texas bolo tie that 
you have there. Yes, he went in for things like

11:08.230 --> 11:10.012
that. So he was a kind of Texas promoter type, but he 
was really vigorous kind of person. He was

11:19.402 --> 11:29.013
trusting forward, always trying to persuade 
people to go along with the ideas and to join the

11:19.402 --> 11:29.013
crowd and all that. I would remark that I had one 
class from him. I don't even remember what the

11:33.438 --> 11:38.203
title of the class was in which he lectured. He 
lectured, and he was on stellar theory. I remember

11:41.494 --> 11:48.661
one particular lecture he gave on how stars work. 
And this wasn't really the official astrophysics

11:48.681 --> 11:55.547
class, stellar astrophysics class, which was 
taught by a different professor. But it was a kind

11:56.248 --> 12:05.457
of one-hour overview of how stars work as 
machines, essentially. And he tried to reduce

12:06.044 --> 12:12.493
everything to the simplest possible one line 
formula with a few constants. And it was a big sort

12:12.673 --> 12:22.026
of power and units type, getting the exponents 
right and understanding why it's a square and not a

12:12.673 --> 12:22.026
cube and getting the units right. And get your 
picture about what is it that matters in making

12:22.347 --> 12:26.713
stars work as engines. And I thought it was very 
well done.
