WEBVTT

00:01.313 --> 00:29.177
270

00:01.313 --> 00:29.177
to return for a final pass. This time down the 
original line of aircraft on my first pass. With

00:32.789 --> 00:35.553
more time and better light, I could do a better job. 
A larger-sized Jap plane stood out from the

00:35.573 --> 00:37.995
others. Looked like a recce plane, perhaps. A what 
kind? Recce. Reconnaissance. Oh, okay. I settled

00:43.362 --> 00:45.444
on it as my primary and let go. It seemed to shake 
itself to pieces right in front of me as I bored down

00:45.524 --> 00:49.128
a point. With inches to spare, I pulled off and 
raked subsequent aircraft with my fire. God only

00:54.114 --> 00:57.518
knows how many aircraft were damaged or destroyed 
in that one pass. I don't know. I just said... Only

00:59.532 --> 01:09.441
seven or eight minutes at the most had passed, and I 
recall seeing only one P-40, Bartlington. As I

01:09.461 --> 01:13.065
banked again, I caught a glimpse of three aircraft 
to my upper right. I choked. Were they Japs? Nope.

01:16.108 --> 01:19.431
Three P-40s pulling off the attack. It's amazing 
to think back how without any specific detailed

01:19.451 --> 01:27.919
pre-planning that experienced people knowing 
what they do, just start and stop something in such

01:29.097 --> 01:33.524
coordination as this. It's just unbelievable, 
but that's the way it happened. And so your three

01:37.670 --> 01:41.837
colleagues were up above, and they were fleeing. 
Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's time to get out of there. To

01:46.144 --> 01:47.265
hell with pushing my luck. I backed up and pulled up 
to join them. And now we were on our way back home. I

01:53.988 --> 01:58.353
looked back at the field as I rounded the southwest 
corner of the mountain and did my heart good. What

01:58.653 --> 02:00.816
satisfaction. This is what I said to myself. 
That's for Mogwe and old Swartz, you bastards.

02:06.563 --> 02:15.253
Swartz was a pilot that was caught in a bomber 
attack at Mogwe and killed on the ground. These

02:15.773 --> 02:26.022
successive passes and resulting destruction in 
that 10 to 12 minutes of aerial attack with nothing

02:15.773 --> 02:26.022
but fighter high caliber gunfire are too much to 
describe completely. The entire airfield seemed

02:26.042 --> 02:32.147
to be in flames the last time I saw it as we headed 
northwest back to Burma. As we learned later, the

02:32.167 --> 02:37.452
entire Japanese Southeast Asian Air Force was out 
of action for a good two weeks. We had apparently

02:38.012 --> 02:45.038
caught them as they amassed a major concentration 
of aircraft just before making a big strike

02:38.012 --> 02:45.038
against us in China. and see the old man this way he 
planned it. Sure. Great planning. At that time,

02:50.894 --> 02:59.763
however, my only thoughts were centered on pride 
of a mission accomplished exactly according to

02:50.894 --> 02:59.763
plan, to Chennault's plan.

03:02.926 --> 03:04.247
So then you continued back. Can I get you now? So you 
continued back. How proud he would be. Hell, I was.

03:10.894 --> 03:12.055
Yeah.

03:14.870 --> 03:19.475
I learned later Bob Neal and Pepper Gornian had 
made several scraping passes and retired also. Ed

03:21.117 --> 03:26.123
Rector and McGarry, they were at the top, the top 
cover, and they were coming back also. So all six of

03:26.143 --> 03:28.726
you are going back now? Now, all six of us are on our 
way back. And the

03:31.089 --> 03:41.641
four of us were together, I think, going back. And 
Bob Neal somehow and one of the other guys got off.

03:45.903 --> 03:46.904
with two aircraft. But I remember only four of us 
together because Blackback McGarry was in my

03:46.924 --> 03:55.797
flight, and I noticed he began to trail back. And 
our little radio wouldn't work. He couldn't

04:01.124 --> 04:02.646
depend on it. Couldn't talk to him. So I started 
circling real slow and to turn back, let him catch

04:03.467 --> 04:08.314
up. And he kept going straight forward. wouldn't 
turn to go with us. And I knew, he knew where we were

04:12.337 --> 04:16.321
going, and he was trying to get there, but 
something was wrong. Because by dawn on me, he was

04:16.341 --> 04:17.782
in trouble. And pretty soon, sure enough, I slowed 
down and started circling around him with the

04:17.982 --> 04:23.347
other guy. And pretty soon, black smoke started 
coming out of his airplane. I knew he was in

04:26.570 --> 04:28.811
trouble, and he started losing altitude. And he 
was going to slow, but we had to put our flaps down in

04:29.612 --> 04:33.756
front of him to stay with him. And I think I remember 
trying then to talk to him on the radio, but never

04:33.776 --> 04:38.600
could get him. And I flew up close enough to him 
where his his canopy was open and smoke was blowing

04:41.135 --> 04:45.521
out of the side of his airplane. And he was getting 
lower and lower. And I could tell, you know, he'd

04:47.624 --> 04:49.847
left for a place to land. This was jungle, hill. And 
we hadn't quite got to the, I think it's the Salween

04:51.989 --> 05:01.161
River that separates the two countries from 
Thailand. And I held up a map. I figured something

05:04.886 --> 05:06.188
was going to happen. I held up a map to show it to him 
that, you know, I was, Robert, let him know that I

05:11.324 --> 05:13.927
had a map I'd get to him. I don't know why I did it, but 
I just held up a map and waved to him. And he'd look at

05:17.130 --> 05:19.193
me every once in a while. And I'd see him every few 
seconds. Then he'd look back at me. And finally,

05:22.276 --> 05:27.382
all of a sudden, his airplane just, he just rolled 
his airplane over like that. And he fell out. He was

05:29.063 --> 05:31.466
bailing out. Oh, so he rolled his airplane over 
upside down. To get out. To bail out. He was doing

05:35.390 --> 05:36.191
bail out. He knew something. He couldn't land. He 
had to bail out. Obviously, his airplane was. He

05:40.838 --> 05:43.703
knew it was gone. Yeah. So he had to get out. And when 
he bailed out, then I started circling to show his

05:45.186 --> 05:49.493
chute open. And I saw him hit the ground, but in the 
trees, or some of those trees, I was 200 feet from

05:50.154 --> 05:56.806
him. But at any rate, I shoot. His chute did open. 
Oh, yeah. And he floated down. And subsequently,

06:01.094 --> 06:04.179
well, I spoke to him. He was captured as a prisoner. 
He was captured by the Japanese then? Yeah. He was

06:08.414 --> 06:13.000
just about two or three miles short of that river 
he'd been in. And I flew over there and dropped my

06:13.121 --> 06:15.043
map over it. I don't know. I doubt if he ever found 
it. I never did ask him. But then, you know, we're

06:17.867 --> 06:19.910
getting old guys. So I said, well, we're old black 
men. So I wiggled for the other guys. What happened

06:25.337 --> 06:27.080
to him? He was captured by the Japs and held 
prisoner of war until the end of the war. And I saw

06:31.446 --> 06:34.470
him at a reunion we had yesterday. Oh, back in

06:35.075 --> 06:45.650
the early 70s, and old Black Mac had gone through a 
rough time. As a matter of fact, he was a little off

06:45.690 --> 06:52.640
his rocker, but he was all right. And he never did 
talk much about it, but apparently it was a shock to

06:52.660 --> 06:56.446
him. Anyway, I don't know where he is now. Okay, so 
that's what happened to one of them. That gives you

07:02.455 --> 07:04.658
five planes. Yeah. So we went on and recovered at 
Namsan. Now, we were reasonably sure that there

07:08.154 --> 07:18.063
wasn't going to be any airplane that got off that 
air base to follow us up, you know, and attack us

07:08.154 --> 07:18.063
while we were refueling. Five of you landed. Well, 
yes.

07:24.468 --> 07:25.329
Five, right. Actually, we anticipated nine. New 
Kirk flight, I haven't even talked about it yet.

07:33.736 --> 07:34.697
Anticipated seven. You anticipated seven. I 
anticipated four.

07:45.602 --> 07:48.165
I anticipated a total of nine airplanes. See, ten 
of us took off. Okay, so you're right. Nine. Nine.

07:52.571 --> 07:53.592
Okay. In other words, we expected nine aircraft to 
recover at the damn time. We've got to have to get

07:56.597 --> 07:59.300
those damn things refueled and get them off of 
there. Yeah. Okay. But where were the other four

08:00.402 --> 08:01.663
going? Well, I'll tell you that. Okay, you're 
going to tell me. Okay. Well, we landed. And I

08:07.887 --> 08:13.173
explained to Bob Neal what had happened to Black 
Mac McGarry. And we discussed this thing. And then

08:14.875 --> 08:20.482
here come three other airplanes out of the other 
four, Newkirk's flight. They come in. And we said,

08:23.946 --> 08:27.109
where's Newkirk? And then they told the story. 
Well, part of the plan with Newkirk was to take off

08:28.771 --> 08:34.738
the same time we did, 10 airplanes that morning, 
All of us were supposed to run and go over the field

08:34.853 --> 08:38.978
at 10,000 feet. For some reason or other, Newkirk 
never did even go to 10,000 feet with his three

08:38.998 --> 08:45.486
other airplanes. But his mission was to hit 
another air base.

08:55.378 --> 08:56.479
He was supposed to hit one. Now, Newkirk's flight 
was supposed to attack an air base at... Lam Lung,

09:02.410 --> 09:10.341
L-A-M-B-L-U-N-G, which was another Japanese air 
base just south of Chiang Mai, about 20 miles. It so

09:11.543 --> 09:21.778
happened that Newkirk, for some reason or 
another, remember I told you he was very depressed

09:11.543 --> 09:21.778
and sad, he and his three remaining guys never 
could explain it. He just said that they took off,

09:21.838 --> 09:28.688
and he never did climb at 10,000 feet, but he 
immediately took off on a course down the

09:29.461 --> 09:38.533
railroad, which passed Chiang Mai, Thailand, 
about two or three miles, three or four miles to the

09:29.461 --> 09:38.533
east of the field. And he stayed right on that 
railroad at low altitude. And that, he got there a

09:42.458 --> 09:51.349
little bit ahead of us, see, having started at low 
altitude, and we climbed at 10,000 feet and crewed

09:42.458 --> 09:51.349
down, so we were a little behind him. So that 
explained why Japanese were getting into their

09:51.369 --> 09:57.477
airplanes, were actually in their airplanes with 
the props turning, Because when his flight passed

09:57.980 --> 10:08.316
over the depot near the city, that got the alert to 
the air base, and they at least had that alert. But

10:09.437 --> 10:13.744
fortunately, we got there in time before they 
could do anything else. Because just as they were

10:14.004 --> 10:20.494
getting in airplanes, and now they saw we were 
hitting them, so they started running for cover.

10:21.267 --> 10:25.072
And he went on down, and strafing, by the way, down 
the railroad track. He went on down to Lam Lung, and

10:25.092 --> 10:28.016
there wasn't a single thing at that air base. So 
they turned around, coming back, strafing that,

10:28.076 --> 10:32.582
you know, targets of opportunity that came back. 
Of course, it's daylight now. And they said when we

10:33.984 --> 10:42.175
passed by the depot again at Chiang Mai, we could 
look up and say there was no doubt where Chiang Mai

10:33.984 --> 10:42.175
Air Base was. Said there was nothing but just a mass 
of black smoke over there in the air, up going over

10:42.355 --> 10:49.184
10,000, 15,000. And It was along there that they 
said Newkirk made a dive on what appeared to be an

10:49.752 --> 11:01.105
armed vehicle, an armed personnel carrier, that 
type of thing. They had a gun, a heavy caliber gun.

11:04.268 --> 11:06.271
It wasn't a tank. But he said as he dove on it, this 
heavy caliber gun shot. And evidently, whatever

11:11.917 --> 11:17.664
it was, caught his airplane, smacked down, and he 
just went right on in. Killed him to death. That's

11:19.672 --> 11:21.795
what happened to Jack Newcoat. The other three 
came on back and then they recovered at the same

11:21.815 --> 11:29.245
place as them saying, right after we did, and 
that's where then we got the story. So all of us

11:29.345 --> 11:32.630
refueled and then went on over to the lower wing. 
Okay, well this guy then almost sabotaged your

11:32.650 --> 11:35.073
mission. That's right. We don't know if he did it 
because he was shaken up because of, you know, not

11:45.305 --> 11:47.267
being given command of the thing. I've heard 
stories from some of his squadron that actually

11:47.908 --> 11:57.058
Jack Newkirk was the boy that dreamed up the 
mission and got Jonathan Ault to prove it. And if

11:58.560 --> 12:08.151
that's the case, then he had more right to be shaken 
up and felt bad about the old man giving it to Bob

11:58.560 --> 12:08.151
Neal. But nevertheless, he disobeyed orders. 
Well, he disobeyed orders, or for some reason or

12:10.972 --> 12:19.465
another, unknowing to us, he couldn't comply with 
it. But anyway, he didn't do what he was supposed to

12:19.485 --> 12:21.749
do. And actually, we couldn't wait on him. That 
could have jeopardized your life. It could have

12:24.613 --> 12:26.236
jeopardized my life. If that explains why those 
Japanese polished me in those airplanes. See,

12:32.946 --> 12:36.692
they already had their props turning, and they 
were getting ready to taxi. We caught them just in

12:37.769 --> 12:39.472
time. You caught them in time. Now, did the other 
three that Newkirk was with, when Newkirk went in

12:40.294 --> 12:48.549
to hit the base, did the other three follow? Oh, the 
other, they stayed. You know, there's a formation

12:49.911 --> 12:52.196
of attack. Did they attack also? They stayed 
together. Huh? Did they also attack the air base?

12:57.145 --> 12:59.389
There was nothing on the air base at Lam Long. No, I 
mean when they came back over the one that you hit.

13:02.914 --> 13:04.356
No, they didn't come over our base. They just come 
down the railroad and pass the railroad station

13:04.436 --> 13:11.208
about three or four miles, which they went by 
before. And this time there was a gun on it, though.

13:14.092 --> 13:19.862
Well, obviously, you know, the whole city had been 
alerted, and the Army, Japanese Army, as well as

13:14.092 --> 13:19.862
the Air Force was alerted. And it probably was an 
armed personnel carrier that was, you know,

13:19.882 --> 13:24.229
alerted and ready, too. In other words, taking on 
the conformation of Air Defense. But it was a

13:30.867 --> 13:32.449
heavy-caliber gun. And it just so happened that 
they caught him. And I don't know if Kirk was a

13:36.836 --> 13:39.300
terrific boy. He had 10 or 12 of his credit at that 
time. OK, so you got back after the raid. This is the

13:49.355 --> 13:53.001
25th of March, which in all sense Oh, he was 
absolutely delighted and elated. And as a matter

13:56.180 --> 14:11.698
of fact,

13:56.180 --> 14:11.698
even the Japanese Air Force acknowledged an 
attack by the Flying Tiger Demon or something,

13:56.180 --> 14:11.698
whatever it was. But they had never admitted all 
their losses. We figured, in my opinion, We had to

14:19.475 --> 14:22.559
have destroyed at least 40 aircraft. There's no 
way possible there couldn't have been these 40

14:22.579 --> 14:26.965
aircraft destroyed. And I think we got credit for 
10, or paid for 10, divided amongst us. Sure,

14:33.354 --> 14:34.536
right. So that's how you got two and a quarter more. 
Yeah. So that gives you your total. I ended up with

14:41.425 --> 14:44.129
nine and a quarter, however it comes out, Terry. 
It's on my discharge. That's what I was paid for.

14:50.255 --> 14:51.657
Well, okay, let's continue. You were back up in 
Kunming. Well, then, of course, we eventually

14:53.860 --> 14:55.943
went back to Kunming. Yeah, okay. And you stayed 
there doing what? And followed the same type of

15:00.250 --> 15:07.641
life for a while, you know, staying on alert and 
wondering how we could get into combat. By this

15:07.741 --> 15:11.226
time, you can imagine how we had stung the Japanese 
Air Force. They were just, you know, they were

15:11.246 --> 15:13.149
leery of us. We hadn't destroyed these flying 
Tiger Demons yet. And here's four airplanes made

15:16.674 --> 15:18.777
this attack. more fighters. So you can imagine how 
shaken up they were. Well, so we figured it,

15:23.086 --> 15:28.812
figured it, figured ways to do it, and no way. And 
then, by the way, this was a period of where no

15:28.933 --> 15:41.246
combat, that, you know, our morale, we began to 
wonder, you know, why stay over here any longer?

15:42.307 --> 15:44.670
And, you know, idle. So it, our morale wasn't too 
hot. And the Japanese was pushing on up into

15:49.553 --> 16:05.998
northern Burma and nibbling at the southern 
border of Yan'an province of China and making

15:49.553 --> 16:05.998
raids on southern China. So the old man decided, 
well, give some action. He called Bob Neill in and

16:09.643 --> 16:18.717
told

16:09.643 --> 16:18.717
him to take, I believe they were, I'll have to refer 
to my diary again, I was one of the guys to go on this

16:19.490 --> 16:22.894
one, too. I was always, you know, I was number two in 
command. Bob and I developed a very close rapport

16:26.557 --> 16:29.340
and mutual respect. Wherever he went, I went. So, I 
went down on this one, and we went to a place in the

16:31.923 --> 16:49.041
south, in the extreme southwestern corner of 
China, just north of the Burma border called

16:31.923 --> 16:49.041
Paoshan, P-A-O-S-H-A-N.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.854
First time that I got in combat when I was shot down.

16:56.957 --> 16:59.360
Okay, this is May 4th. So you sat around there for a 
month and a half, and finally it's May 4th, 1942.

17:08.130 --> 17:19.602
Okay,

17:08.130 --> 17:19.602
so tell me about this mission, May 4th, 1942.

17:25.555 --> 17:31.361
We had just returned from a sort of a patrol flight 
in northern Burma. And Bob Neal had caught a

17:31.441 --> 17:39.589
Japanese observation plane at so altitude, it was 
like shooting ducks out of the air and shot him

17:31.441 --> 17:39.589
down. And I kid him when we got back that he ought to 
have been shaming himself, catching the poor boy

17:39.729 --> 17:45.995
like that, stepping up on him. But when we got back- 
Did he even have any guns on him, an observation

17:46.015 --> 17:50.299
plane? Well, whether he had any guns or not, I don't 
know. But I know he never even knew Bob was on him. It

17:55.559 --> 18:00.547
was about 1,000 feet in the air, and Bob hit him. He 
just went straight

18:00.607 --> 18:05.514
in. Then we settled down. I started cleaning my 
pistol. Didn't have anything to do. We were on a

18:09.120 --> 18:10.422
standing alert. I started cleaning my pistol. We 
heard some noises overhead, went outside the

18:14.047 --> 18:19.295
alert track to find two Japanese wreckage ships 
high overhead. Bartling and I took off in hopes of

18:20.297 --> 18:23.001
catching them. By the time we got to 80,000 feet, 
they were gone. On the way to recover at the field, I

18:25.741 --> 18:32.749
heard Bob Neal on the radio, and I knew he was 
already back from Kunming near Paoshan. In a few

18:32.849 --> 18:35.813
minutes, Bob and Mickey showed up over the field. 
Apparently, Mickey was okay enough to return to

18:35.853 --> 18:40.498
the field. Bob Neal, Bob Little, one of the aces of 
the Flying Tigers, killed about two months after

18:40.598 --> 18:50.389
that, by the way. and I was still involved in 
cleaning our pistols when Neil yelled for us to man

18:50.842 --> 18:55.649
our ships. We dashed out to the plains, and by the 
time I had started my engine, I looked up and saw the

18:57.052 --> 19:05.545
Jap bomber formation high above and heading 
toward our field. It looked like about 25 bombers

19:05.565 --> 19:09.711
and about 18,000 feet. Neil started shooting his 
pistol in the air to get everyone's attention and

19:09.731 --> 19:15.921
started running for the ditch immediately behind 
our parking area. My engine had warmed up. I sat

19:18.404 --> 19:22.629
there in the cockpit with my hand on the throttle 
and paused for a second. Hell, I can make it, I

19:22.649 --> 19:24.010
thought. I shoved the throttle open and headed 
straight across the field. I had not gotten into my

19:28.034 --> 19:31.177
parachute or put my helmet on. I was just sitting in 
the cockpit. I didn't even have my seatbelt on yet,

19:33.459 --> 19:36.042
and my canter was still open. The only thought 
entering my mind was to get airborne and beyond the

19:36.462 --> 19:42.228
edge of the field before the bombs hit. My speed 
built up unusually slow, and suddenly my tail

19:42.248 --> 19:46.752
literally jumped off the ground. Damn, I had not 
even put up my flaps, which was pre-takeoff

19:47.002 --> 19:50.886
procedure. I had quite a lot of field yet, so I put 
them up. I leaped forward and just did manage to

19:54.350 --> 19:59.135
clear the rock barricade at the far end of the 
field. I turned to the left and started getting

19:59.155 --> 20:03.720
into my gear as I started a maximum climb. I could 
see the bomber formation clearly now. They

20:05.882 --> 20:07.704
skipped the field and were bombing the city. I 
wasn't climbing nearly as fast as I expected.

20:10.948 --> 20:11.789
Something was wrong. I had full throttle and RPM. 
Oh, hell, I forgot my landing gear and all the haste

20:13.711 --> 20:16.654
and excitement. I got up and then started gaining 
on the bomber formations. They were now in a wide

20:21.740 --> 20:26.625
sweeping turn to head back south after dropping 
their bomb. I cut across and pulled up in a steeper

20:26.645 --> 20:28.767
climb. In the meantime, I stole a quick look at the 
city below. The bombing was almost perfect, right

20:31.169 --> 20:34.413
in the middle of the city. Those yellow bastards, I 
thought. I looked around for possible enemy

20:37.596 --> 20:44.363
fighter escort and saw none, but I did pick up the 
second wave of about the same number of bombers. So

20:44.714 --> 20:46.356
how many bombers were there? Fifty. Fifty 
bombers? Fifty or fifty-four, I'll give you a

20:48.519 --> 20:50.441
question. Two big formats. My goodness. I had a 
better chance against them since they were

20:53.245 --> 20:59.613
treading the first enemy waves, so I positioned 
myself to concentrate on them. This is

20:59.653 --> 21:00.554
approximate. I was the only one there. You were the 
only one? Yeah. See, I really violated orders. Bob

21:05.020 --> 21:06.482
Neal told us all to get in the ditch. It's too late. 
So I took off. Thinking, you know, I... And that's

21:10.387 --> 21:13.371
the reason I forgot so many things. They were at 
18,000 feet and a single, huge V formation, very

21:14.245 --> 21:18.332
tight. I got about 1,000 feet above and off to the 
right. I made a diving left turn and pulled up into

21:22.199 --> 21:27.027
the right rear quarter of the outside flank of the 
formation. I closed in on the flank bomber and

21:27.108 --> 21:29.351
squeezed the trigger. My burst completely 
enveloped the fuselage, but I saw no smoke or fire.

21:34.200 --> 21:38.227
The two adjacent bombers immediately started 
streaming a bluish-white smoke. I knew I hadn't

21:38.247 --> 21:39.409
hit them. They were pulling the old trick of 
releasing smoke to attract me to them as wounded

21:39.929 --> 21:44.615
aircraft. We had been briefed on this trick, but 
this was the first time I'd seen it. I wasn't about

21:49.540 --> 21:51.042
to take that bait. The bomber on the extreme flank 
end pulled away a bit, and this made it even more

21:51.363 --> 21:56.709
obvious. I continued my rear right quarter 
attacks at it first, and on my third attack, I saw

21:56.729 --> 22:03.777
his right engine disintegrate and ignite into a 
flaming torch. He went down through the overcast.

22:06.721 --> 22:09.244
I continued on the next bomber on the tail of the V. 
Is this too detailed? No. Suddenly my guns quit

22:12.546 --> 22:14.328
firing. I had become too engrossed in my attacks. I 
had obviously been firing long, by far too long

22:16.972 --> 22:21.038
bursts. Recharging guns produced no results. I 
had to be out of ammunition. I pulled away sharply,

22:24.583 --> 22:30.892
and then diving, 180 screen, 180 return to head 
back. I had to run out of ammo. I told you before I

22:32.714 --> 22:34.857
wasn't a good gunner. Now where am I? I had chased 
some 50 enemy bombers down across northern Burma

22:37.237 --> 22:41.942
and only gotten one. I was downright disappointed 
in myself. Also, in my gunnery, I had them all to

22:45.246 --> 22:50.392
myself, and there were no enemy fighter escort 
whatsoever. But there was nothing to do now but get

22:50.412 --> 22:53.756
back to Palashan. How far were you? I mean, about 
how many miles were you from the air base now to get

22:56.700 --> 23:00.744
back to land? Let me see if I see. I spied the Burma 
Road bridge over the Salarain River and felt

23:04.979 --> 23:09.163
better about my position. I knew where I was now and 
I had a sufficient field over an action chain

23:10.804 --> 23:15.869
before I slided head-directed to the field. I 
couldn't have been

23:16.270 --> 23:29.302
more than sixty or seventy miles, maybe eighty or 
seventy miles south of the field. I had begun to

23:30.643 --> 23:34.767
recount everything I had done on the flight and 
furthered my remorse that I didn't get more jets.

23:37.374 --> 23:44.480
Soon the field appeared up ahead, and as I got 
closer in, I tried to pick up our ground station on

23:37.374 --> 23:44.480
the radio. Several calls brought no reply, and I 
was now in a steep dive toward the field. I leveled

23:49.905 --> 23:53.408
out and did a slow roll as I crossed over the alert 
area. I tried the radio again with the same results

23:53.428 --> 23:58.732
and decided that they were probably in the 
ditches. I thought I'd make a wide turn around the

23:58.752 --> 24:04.197
city and spread out my traffic pattern to examine 
the bomb damage in the city. What a sight. The city

24:07.158 --> 24:10.904
had been spilling over with evacuees, and they 
were jammed throughout the place. The Japanese

24:11.004 --> 24:15.310
bombs had caught them without any warning. Fire 
seemed to be engulfing the entire city, and I could

24:16.852 --> 24:21.638
see many buildings and houses blown to bits. My 
approach to the field took me squarely over the

24:21.919 --> 24:30.531
middle of the city, and after one last look, I 
concentrated on the landing approach and slowed

24:21.919 --> 24:30.531
down to get my flaps and landing gear down. I had 
just moved the gear lever forward when I heard

24:30.551 --> 24:34.977
several loud explosions. The noise stunned me for 
a second, and I immediately concluded that my

24:35.311 --> 24:40.275
landing gear hydraulic system had blown up. I had 
been having trouble with my gear operating

24:40.455 --> 24:47.241
correctly the last several days, but I never 
really found anything wrong with it. I decided to

24:48.502 --> 24:52.586
try to recycle the gear lever, and when I reached 
down, I cried out in pain. I had stuck my left hand

24:53.446 --> 24:56.869
with no gloves on in a raging fire. I unconsciously 
swung my head around and looked to my rear. There

25:00.813 --> 25:04.896
they were, three Jap Zeros right on my tail and 
firing like mad at me. The explosions were

25:05.737 --> 25:09.881
explosive rounds of ammo hitting the armor plate 
behind my seat. The bullets had gone through my

25:10.421 --> 25:17.067
fuselage tank, but still had a few gallons of fuel 
in it before impacting the armor plate. The

25:17.087 --> 25:22.673
fuselage tank had also exploded, and the fire was 
whipping into my lower rear cockpit and then up

25:17.087 --> 25:22.673
around my lower body. What a stoop I had been. I had 
become so engrossed with the bombing scene below

25:25.335 --> 25:31.260
that I had made that fatal mistake that a fighter 
pilot should never get caught doing. I hadn't

25:31.981 --> 25:34.123
suspected enemy fighters in the area. 
Incidentally, looking back now, that was exactly

25:35.116 --> 25:39.321
the way they had planned it. They had expected all 
of us to get off, and they'd catch all of us just

25:39.341 --> 25:49.534
landing without any fuel, and then they'd just 
annihilate us. The Japs had laid this attack on a

25:49.554 --> 25:51.897
little different. They knew our situation 
perfectly from the two recce flights that had just

25:51.917 --> 25:56.603
preceded the bombers. They decided to forego the 
fighters as an escort and hold them off and away

25:56.623 --> 26:04.313
from the field with the idea of catching all of us 
when we returned to the field. low on ammunition

26:05.170 --> 26:08.834
and gas, and that is exactly how they caught me. For 
a split second, I think I actually was on the verge

26:10.196 --> 26:13.139
of giving up. That's true. I remember it very 
vividly. But the old human mind and body being what

26:18.165 --> 26:21.408
it is would not let me. I recall very vividly this 
day that I am touching this experience, that I

26:22.129 --> 26:33.422
leaned forward as far as my seatbelt would permit, 
closed my eyes because the fire had begun to

26:22.129 --> 26:33.422
completely engulf me, reached over with my right 
hand to grasp the canopy crank and rolled it fully

26:33.723 --> 26:37.748
back. Unhooked my seat belt with my left hand and 
then put both hands on the stick and went through

26:39.190 --> 26:53.069
the motion of what I knew would make the ship climb 
abruptly and roll over one half turn to the right.

26:53.189 --> 26:55.372
How high were you? How was your altitude? I was on my 
approach about ready to flare out on the landing.

27:02.482 --> 27:03.223
I'd say... 300 feet above the ground, 200 feet. So 
you needed more altitude before you jumped.

27:08.334 --> 27:08.615
Right. So I climbed up. See, when I pulled a stick 
up, I figured I'd climb a little and just pause a few

27:10.398 --> 27:16.691
seconds to get some altitude. In other words, I was 
doing like this. I was going to do like this. Sure.

27:21.781 --> 27:23.083
And then fall out. And that's the maneuver I went 
through. would make the ship climb abruptly and

27:27.014 --> 27:30.437
roll over one half turn to the right. Then I took my 
hand off the control column and reached for the

27:30.537 --> 27:37.003
right side of the cockpit to get out of the seat. The 
step between grabbed me as the upper part of my body

27:37.023 --> 27:40.967
protruded outside of the cockpit. It literally 
dragged me out of the cockpit. I had forgotten my

27:42.748 --> 27:47.893
earphone connection to the radio plug, but the 
force of the wind tore it loose. I knew I was out of

27:48.754 --> 27:51.536
the airplane, and I opened my eyes. One minute I 
would see the blue sky, and the next I would see the

27:51.676 --> 27:54.639
ground. I realized I was tumbling. I looked down to 
find a metal ring to pull my parachute, jerked it

27:56.073 --> 28:00.898
wildly. I immediately felt it tugging and then a 
violent jerk. I was sitting in a parachute strap

28:03.120 --> 28:05.643
and floating down the earth. Suddenly I became 
terrified. Those dirty yellow sons of bitches

28:08.346 --> 28:12.029
will scrape me like they did at Rangoon. 
Automatically I started praying. And I mean this.

28:16.254 --> 28:18.516
I started praying. Now, about how high were you at 
this time after you jumped? How was your altitude

28:22.972 --> 28:24.294
here? And I must have been doing it aloud because I 
can remember it so vividly. I prayed devoutly to

28:28.058 --> 28:29.360
God. I was doing it with my eyes closed. I opened my 
eyes to look for the zebras, and it was like I

28:31.202 --> 28:34.566
suppose heaven would be. They had pulled away and 
were heading southward. Looking down, I saw the

28:37.911 --> 28:42.156
ground rushing up at me, and I knew it would hit 
backwards if I didn't do something. To answer your

28:42.176 --> 28:43.958
question, I couldn't have been. Well, they told me 
later on from the ground. I probably fell out of the

28:45.861 --> 28:48.244
airplane 500 feet. So the parachute probably 
opened about 200 feet. I wasn't, it wasn't very

28:51.440 --> 28:54.903
long I had my feet on the ground after it opened. And 
that's probably one reason they didn't break me,

28:54.923 --> 28:59.788
they didn't have time to get back up. I tried to kick 
around my harness and I did get about halfway

28:59.808 --> 29:03.592
around when I hit. I fell across some large 
sun-dried clouds of earth in a rice paddy.

29:11.700 --> 29:15.704
The parachute gradually floated to the ground 
beside me as I tumbled a few times across the

29:11.700 --> 29:15.704
ground. I sat up and realized I still had the grip 
cord and metal ring in my right hand. Looking back

29:20.245 --> 29:22.448
now, it must have been in an iron grip. I have it in my 
memo right now. Unusual to ever do that. Usually

29:28.357 --> 29:29.439
drop it. I came to my senses and punched a quick 
release on the parachute hornet. The strap fell

29:33.826 --> 29:39.594
away and I got up to run to a nearby knoll as a barrier 
to a possible strafing run by a lone Japanese

29:33.826 --> 29:39.594
fighter. I squatted there watching the remaining 
Japanese fighters make strafing passes on the

29:40.556 --> 29:44.241
field. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was 
squatting behind a traditional Chinese burial

29:46.942 --> 29:52.588
mound of earth in the cemetery. I had come down in a 
Chinese cemetery about a mile from the landing

29:52.608 --> 29:57.474
field. Out of nowhere came a P-40 right on the tail 
of a Japanese as both of them went directly across

29:57.494 --> 30:04.382
the field in what was obviously a Jap strafing 
attack. It was, I learned later, old Bob Little,

30:04.462 --> 30:09.908
who had gotten into the air after the bombers had 
dropped their bombs. See, he knew I'd be coming

30:11.770 --> 30:13.692
back. I felt a burning sensation about my neck and 
shoulders and suddenly realized that my scarf and

30:14.617 --> 30:20.644
flying suit must be on fire. It happened that a 
small stream was flowing through the cemetery

30:21.184 --> 30:27.531
where I was crouched, so I laid down and watered in 
the water on my back. My head was hurting and I

30:27.551 --> 30:29.994
unconsciously reached up to rub it. I felt 
something wet and threw my hand away to look at it.

30:32.477 --> 30:32.977
It was blood. Jesus Christ. I looked at my hands. 
They had been badly burned and the skin had already

30:36.141 --> 30:39.865
been torn loose in several areas. Blisters were 
forming. My face and neck and upper shoulder were

30:41.754 --> 30:45.619
scorched, and in some cases erupting in blisters. 
My eyebrows were gone. Pain began to set in. There

30:49.224 --> 30:54.671
were many Chinese natives in the cemetery 
crashing behind a burial hill, just as I was. I

30:54.691 --> 30:56.294
motioned for one of them to come over to me. He 
racked warily, but did start walking slowly

30:56.374 --> 31:00.840
toward me. He had one hand behind his back. I went 
through the gestures of picking up a telephone and

31:04.632 --> 31:11.263
calling someone and uttered the usual Chinese 
greeting, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. I did not have my

31:12.445 --> 31:19.156
flying jacket on, the back of which was sewn the 
Chinese-American flag and directly written in

31:12.445 --> 31:19.156
Chinese to help us. But somehow he must have gotten 
a message, for he smiled lightly and brought his

31:19.176 --> 31:26.168
hand from behind his back to reveal a large rock. He 
was ready to give me the word, thinking I was the

31:26.489 --> 31:28.853
enemy. He motioned for me to follow him and led me 
off to a cluster of huts. We entered one, and a group

31:32.786 --> 31:37.571
of Chinese peasants looked at me with no signs of 
any kind of emotion. And they can do that. But there

31:40.554 --> 31:41.655
was a telephone. Somehow I got them to understand 
the words of my American doctor. We had a doc down

31:45.559 --> 31:46.820
there, by the way. It's amazing what sign language 
can do between human beings in an emergency. I

31:51.505 --> 31:58.131
didn't talk to anyone on the phone, but one Chinese 
was on it continually, and I can only assume that

31:51.505 --> 31:58.131
the word got back to our AVG hospital. Old Doc 
Richards appeared in the doorway all of a sudden. I

32:02.087 --> 32:04.190
will never forget that moment. The agony of my 
burns led me on the verge of passing out. I honestly

32:06.994 --> 32:09.237
wanted to die to get out of the pain. I would lie 
down, get up, walk around, lie down, get up, hold my

32:09.257 --> 32:16.327
hands up in the air to reduce the circulation of 
throbbing pain. Cry out aloud and pray.

32:20.934 --> 32:23.137
They took my clothes off, all except my shorts. My 
helmet revealed two longitudinal tears, and I

32:23.337 --> 32:27.443
remember examining it. Apparently the armor 
plate and the P-40 was tapered off at the top to

32:27.592 --> 32:33.640
resemble the marrying head on the shoulders of a 
man. Had barely kept all but a couple of bullets

32:35.702 --> 32:39.847
from hitting me, otherwise I would have been 
killed. Two bullets had barely missed the armor

32:39.867 --> 32:48.919
plate, but just enough to still rip past my head, 
close enough to scar my scalp and bring blood. I

32:49.760 --> 32:55.607
still have some of those shrapnel bits in my scalp 
now, about the size of pinheads. Doc greeted me as

32:56.414 --> 32:58.557
he would his son. I practically fell in his arms 
with only one plea. Get me out of this pain. He went

33:02.382 --> 33:03.464
right to work. My head was not too bad, this small 
lesion from the grazing bullets. My eyelashes and

33:06.768 --> 33:08.370
eyebrows were gone. My face was blistered 
slightly on the left side, clearly outlying the

33:09.452 --> 33:14.819
bit of my helmet strapped across my face. Around 
the hairline of my neck was an open wound of burnt

33:16.301 --> 33:22.810
flesh where the helmet connection plugged to my 
aircraft radio dug into my flesh when I forgot to

33:23.245 --> 33:26.229
unhook it upon bailing out. My shoulder blades 
were heavily blistered, and one blister ran down

33:26.309 --> 33:31.897
the middle of my back some six or eight inches. My 
right thumb was blistered, but my whole left hand

33:31.917 --> 33:37.185
looked terrible, a third-degree burn. I never saw 
my plane hit the ground. Peden, a mechanic on the

33:39.067 --> 33:44.375
ground, said he had hit and bounced for 100 yards or 
so and then lined up in a ball of fire. Top Rich and

33:45.336 --> 33:50.704
Bob Neal both had fired their pistols at me, trying 
to get my attention, but zeroes were on the table. I

33:51.933 --> 33:57.780
learned from them that they were actually firing 
at me through a good 270 degrees on my turn over the

33:51.933 --> 33:57.780
city. Prior to rolling out on my approach to the 
field, they never did hit me until I straightened

33:57.800 --> 34:02.766
up. Doc gave me a shot in the arm, a couple of 
capsules or something, and then sat for a minute or

34:02.786 --> 34:08.453
so to let the stuff set in. Then he started pulling 
the skin off the blister. He looked at the U.S. Army

34:11.757 --> 34:16.303
Air Corps ring on my left hand and said that it had to 
come off. I just peered back at the dope again and

34:16.553 --> 34:19.016
grabbed me. Even then, though, when he pulled the 
ring off with the burned flesh with it, I nearly hit

34:19.156 --> 34:23.180
the ceiling. To top that off, he started pouring 
peroxide on the open wall places. I guess it was on

34:27.385 --> 34:30.889
the verge of minor conversion, but fortunately 
the dope took hold. Somehow I felt glad that he was

34:31.169 --> 34:34.013
doing whatever he was. Is this getting that? Am I 
too fast? No. He smeared gentian violet all over

34:38.998 --> 34:44.164
the upper part of my body and very heavily over the 
burned portions. I rapidly became a gooey mess. He

34:46.414 --> 34:48.758
asked me if I could walk, and I replied that I could. 
My socks were wet, and I had lost my boots. A Chinese

34:51.762 --> 34:56.069
lady furnished me with a pair of sneakers, and we 
left for the jeeps outside. My flying suit had been

34:57.170 --> 35:01.537
tied at the waistline to keep it off my burns and the 
upper part of my body. On the way through the rice

35:01.597 --> 35:09.409
paddy to the jeeps, Bob Neal came up and told Doc 
Richards that Benny Fauché was in a bad way from

35:01.597 --> 35:09.409
bomb shrapnel. A Chinese doctor had wanted to 
amputate one of Benny's legs. He was one of our

35:13.437 --> 35:15.459
pilots. But he would not have it and kept yelling 
for Dr. Rich. I heard the doctor go on and take care

35:18.122 --> 35:22.507
of Benny and that I was okay now. We met Bob Little at 
the junction with the main city road and we joked

35:22.527 --> 35:27.012
about the whole deal. I had gotten one and he hadn't 
gotten any. By now, the dope had taken over and I

35:30.315 --> 35:35.061
could feel nothing. Hence, Denny Bob Foshay died. 
Bob Neal and Bob Little A Chinese interpreter and I

35:39.258 --> 35:43.724
clambered aboard another jeep and struck out 
through the city for the hospital. Well, we drove

35:43.744 --> 35:55.419
through the city, and I remember the, well, I saw 
one body with no leg, arms, or head, another with

35:43.744 --> 35:55.419
his skull half gone. Once Bob Little had to get out 
of the jeep to move a large timber from our path.

35:59.004 --> 36:01.748
When he heaved to the side, a human head rolled 
across the road. The air was filled with the smell

36:02.529 --> 36:07.375
of burning flesh, and if you have once smelled this 
odor, you will never forget it. One very pitiful

36:07.945 --> 36:15.479
sight was a wedding Chinese mother in the middle of 
the road on her knees with a dead child in her arms

36:07.945 --> 36:15.479
and her equally stricken husband at her side. Had I 
not been under the influence of dope, I'm sure it

36:16.621 --> 36:21.389
would have hooked Chuck right there. At times, I 
thought Neil and Little both would vomit. None of

36:23.633 --> 36:28.342
us ever said a word to each other during that entire 
tip. We learned it before she had died.

36:33.072 --> 36:35.655
About 30 minutes after arriving at the hospital, 
we had another scare. And all of a sudden, me and my

36:35.675 --> 36:38.519
dragon cover all ran into the ditches.

36:42.224 --> 36:43.745
Doc gave me some sleeping pills. Thank God I was 
still alive. And they done a blister pack and went

36:44.767 --> 36:46.569
to sleep. And that was the end of the 4th of May. What 
a day.

36:55.881 --> 36:59.145
I don't know if you can still see the scar right 
there. Is that one of the hair on it? Subsequent to

37:01.422 --> 37:22.960
this, of

37:01.422 --> 37:22.960
course,

37:01.422 --> 37:22.960
we lost all the other airplanes on the ground. How 
many were there on the ground? I think we had six.

37:25.486 --> 37:28.711
Bob Little got off with one, so the four airplanes 
were lost. I think we later on recovered one or two

37:28.871 --> 37:31.195
of those. Did Little lose his plane? No, no. He got 
back in all right. And this is part of the story on

37:35.702 --> 37:39.388
the return that I want to tell you about. It's 
rather interesting.

37:43.514 --> 37:45.117
We had to get out of there right away. It was a fun day 
because we were afraid he'd come back over here and

37:45.137 --> 37:48.602
catch us. They were determined to knock us out. 
They were doing a good job so far. so the next day we

37:53.347 --> 38:22.965
had a uh paul shan paul shan the next day on may the 
fifth uh we uh had a the youngest the the united

37:53.347 --> 38:22.965
states army air corps air transport command had 
begun to come in there and there was a gooney bird

37:53.347 --> 38:22.965
c40 a c uh dc3 type that uh one of the pilots uh uh from 
texas i'm kidding was coming there to pick us up so

37:53.347 --> 38:22.965
we got as much uh salvaged out of the airplane if we 
could. The airmen did, like 50 calibers, you know,

38:24.702 --> 38:32.210
took them out of the airplane, and threw them all in 
the back of this airplane, and we're going to

38:24.702 --> 38:32.210
evacuate the place. And Benny Fauché's body 
actually was still limp. We put it, the doc put it

38:38.817 --> 38:51.470
right in the entrance of the airplane and laid it up 
against the back

38:38.817 --> 38:51.470
wall of the thing, and then covered him with a 
blanket. He was just sitting there. cover him with

38:52.915 --> 38:54.016
a blanket. Of course, I was still down my waist with 
the cover on. Bob Neal got on. And Bob Little was

38:58.000 --> 39:00.943
going to take his good airplane. He got refueling 
on. He was going to stay with us, escort us, at least

39:01.724 --> 39:08.171
escort this airplane, back over up to Kunming. 
That was a distance of some maybe an hour and

39:08.491 --> 39:12.135
20-minute flight.

39:14.717 --> 39:16.799
And we wanted to get out of there as soon as we could. 
So in our haste and all, everybody got on the

39:17.080 --> 39:22.365
airplane. The vice commander of the American 
Voluntary Group, we called him the vice

39:22.649 --> 39:30.377
commander, he was sort of an administrator, a guy 
by the name of Happy Greenlaw. He was the husband of

39:30.417 --> 39:35.001
the gal who wrote The Tiger and the Lady, Olga 
Greenlaw. And she was supposedly the historian of

39:35.982 --> 39:43.230
the ABG, and she didn't give her anything to get a 
hold of this. He gave me a great big slug of Johnny

39:45.952 --> 39:51.778
Walker Red Label. Every few seconds and a few 
minutes on the airplane on the way up, he'd give me

39:51.978 --> 39:56.685
another slug. And by the time we got up to Kunming, I 
was about half tight. But the gentian violet, you

40:02.414 --> 40:09.624
may have seen it sad, but to put on for burns in Notre 
Dame, I smeared with it. How do you spell it?

40:11.307 --> 40:13.150
G-E-N-T-I-A-N, velvet. It's very good for burns. 
It's a gelatin type stuff. And once you get it on

40:17.636 --> 40:20.240
you, you have to let it wear off. There's no way to 
clean it off. It turned to purple. So for a long,

40:22.864 --> 40:27.410
long time, they called me Deep Purple in the 
deployment. But on the way up, we took off. Bob

40:29.733 --> 40:31.875
Little was escorting us. Next thing we know, we got 
up to what I assume was a cruising altitude above

40:31.895 --> 40:37.001
the mountain, like 6,000 or 8,000 feet. And I 
looked out the window, and here's Bob Neal and his

40:37.862 --> 40:46.553
P-40 round the wing of this airplane, just 
violently wiggling his wings, you know, and

40:37.862 --> 40:46.553
waving his hands. I told Bob, I said, what time is 
Bob Little? He looked out there. He went up to the

40:51.310 --> 40:55.737
front of the airplane and told Tex, whatever his 
name was. Told the pilot. Yeah, told the pilot to

40:57.019 --> 41:04.972
look over there and

40:57.019 --> 41:04.972
couldn't communicate. And Bob Little kept doing 
like that. And finally, Bob Neal says, well,

41:11.182 --> 41:13.686
what's he doing? He says, what do you want us to turn 
around for? He says, we're going to Kunming,

41:16.911 --> 41:18.634
aren't we? The pilot looked at him and said, no, 
we're not going to Kunming, we're going to, uh,

41:19.373 --> 41:24.562
Dinjian, India. And Bob said, you turn this thing 
around, we're going to Kunming. The guy had, for

41:29.049 --> 41:35.720
some reason or another, he was returning to India 
over the hump, which had been about a three hour

41:29.049 --> 41:35.720
flight. So he got him turned around and we 
proceeded on up to Kunming. So it hadn't been for

41:39.747 --> 41:44.215
not old, had it not been for Bob Little, we, uh... 
You would have gone to India. Yeah. Well, I wanted

41:45.479 --> 41:46.700
to tell you that. And then we got to Harrison Holt 
Medicine, of course, and he was very concerned

41:46.720 --> 41:54.649
about me, and

41:46.720 --> 41:54.649
that's how I was. How long did it take before your 
condition improved? They immediately put me in

41:57.132 --> 42:00.235
the hospital, and I stayed in the hospital. We had 
two nurses very fondly. Were they American or

42:02.418 --> 42:03.719
Chinese? American.

42:08.565 --> 42:11.328
Joe... So you were in the hospital for how long? I 
stayed in the hospital about Just about two weeks.

42:17.767 --> 42:22.051
And then I went back over the house and recuperated 
a few days, going to Charlie. Thereafter, we went

42:22.392 --> 42:25.415
back in the P-40 and we were hit. So it was about 
three weeks before you were back in the airplanes.

42:28.978 --> 42:29.399
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I think it was in April, we 
headed for Chongqing for some more episodes down

42:29.419 --> 42:39.208
in Kuala Lumpur.

42:42.111 --> 42:43.152
OK. We're already in Maine here. Kunming. We went 
to Chongqing, north of Kunming. And then later on,

42:47.742 --> 42:50.788
we're going to fly from Chongqing down to Kualian. 
No, but you said April. Well, see, this happened in

42:53.433 --> 42:55.777
May. I'm sorry, May. June.

43:01.408 --> 43:02.871
In June, we went to Chongqing.

43:13.195 --> 43:14.657
24th of May. June. 24th of May. Oh, okay. We went to 
Chongqing, China, 24th of May. And what was your

43:23.166 --> 43:24.427
mission down there? Well, there again, the 
Japanese had been bombing Chongqing. They didn't

43:30.154 --> 43:31.115
have any air defense. They didn't have any air 
force. So we were going to do Chongqing. Oh, there

43:35.199 --> 43:36.341
it is. Okay. So it's north. Yeah. And now that the 
nationalist capital of China.

43:49.276 --> 43:58.346
We, again, we were going to, matter of fact, we, by 
that time, we had the three squadrons practically

43:49.276 --> 43:58.346
together at Kunming. What had left? What was left 
of your original 70 planes or so? What was left? Oh,

44:03.652 --> 44:05.674
no, I'd say we had... But originally you had about 
70, so what was left? I'd say we had about... Oh,

44:11.448 --> 44:14.752
yeah, we started getting some P-40Es back. I mean, 
the Air Force started sending us some P-40Es. I

44:20.058 --> 44:28.429
think two or three of the pilots had been over in 
India and buried in about five P-40Es, newer type

44:20.058 --> 44:28.429
aircraft. We must have had at least 45, 50 or so, at 
least. And most of them were concentrated in

44:36.018 --> 44:39.362
Kunming. So your squadron is up at Chongqing? Our 
squadron and part of another squadron was to take

44:43.485 --> 44:50.553
off and make a mass flight to Chongqing. And the 
idea was, again, a little bit of vocal

44:51.254 --> 45:00.024
intelligence or psychological tactic. As I say, 
the Japs had been hitting Chongqing freely. And to

45:03.328 --> 45:07.172
get in the water some way would at least defend 
against it. And also at this time, it was obvious

45:08.317 --> 45:20.173
the Japanese were going to redirect their effort 
to get taken over China from the coast and the west

45:08.317 --> 45:20.173
and the east, rather than up through Burma. They 
had sort of given up the idea of coming up through

45:20.193 --> 45:22.796
Burma. Logistically, it was almost impossible. 
So the old man sent, I think it was about 24

45:26.361 --> 45:34.592
airplanes, two of them, about 12 in each, 
something like that. And we flew up to Chongqing.

45:37.358 --> 45:42.064
and would make a pass around over the city and come 
back, fly way out from the city. Then we'd come back

45:42.205 --> 45:47.912
and fly over the city again and make it look like, 
you know, maybe in a different formation,

45:42.205 --> 45:47.912
something like that. Make it look like an awful lot 
of P-40s had come into Chongqing because we knew

45:47.932 --> 45:55.963
damn well there was a lot of spies, you know, 
Japanese in the city. Then we went on out and landed

45:55.983 --> 45:58.827
at the field. Well, actually, they quit bombing 
Chongqing. Well, after we got there, the bombers

46:03.233 --> 46:06.758
came out. So the word got back to you? Oh yeah. And 
then we stayed there for a while and there's really

46:10.466 --> 46:21.138
no episodes there worth mentioning, except we did 
go on alert. What was the Capitol like? It took

46:24.642 --> 46:33.271
about two hours to drive along the tortuous 
country roads and over the mountains, into the

46:24.642 --> 46:33.271
Capitol proper. And I went in only a couple of 
times. And I think when they're getting paid, the

46:37.366 --> 46:49.588
headquarters of the CAMCOR, Central Aircraft 
Manufacturing Company, which paid us, was in the

46:37.366 --> 46:49.588
capital, you know, where the Lend-Lease 
arrangement and everything was made. Were there

46:49.608 --> 46:51.552
more Americans in there? We had two of our liaison 
boys assigned there. Jim Cross, one of the buddies

46:54.457 --> 46:57.282
that went over with us, he asked for it.
