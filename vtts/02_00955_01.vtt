WEBVTT

00:04.773 --> 00:34.392
missed you completely would you please stop it 
testing one two three stop it please we don't have

00:04.773 --> 00:34.392
much

00:04.773 --> 00:34.392
the first question is um what were some of the 
highlights of your years in the house of

00:04.773 --> 00:34.392
representatives

00:04.773 --> 00:34.392
well it depends on whose opinion in your opinion it 
takes uh I guess

00:34.844 --> 01:02.775
being leader of the

00:34.844 --> 01:02.775
time that Termin was Speaker of the House, and one 
of the, I guess, aggressive things that I was

00:34.844 --> 01:02.775
chairman of the committee that made University of 
Houston was a fully state-supported school.

01:11.564 --> 01:27.985
Before

01:11.564 --> 01:27.985
this bill was passed, it was supported as a junior 
college, but not as a senior college. And I was

01:29.367 --> 01:34.534
chairman of the committee that recommended and 
passed in the House that it be made a full

01:35.020 --> 01:42.969
state-supported school. Because at that time, 
Houston

01:43.390 --> 01:53.542
was paying 1 20th of the state taxes.

01:56.245 --> 02:04.875
And

01:56.245 --> 02:04.875
my committee thought that they should have a full 
state-supported school. if they're paying that

02:06.543 --> 02:10.508
much taxes.

02:10.528 --> 02:18.076
And the people were there to support it. When I went 
through the House journals in your first session

02:18.096 --> 02:26.806
that you were in, there weren't that many ag bills 
passed. Why was this? What was most important

02:31.672 --> 02:34.255
during that session?

02:42.655 --> 03:03.364
Well, there wasn't many ag bills paid

02:42.655 --> 03:03.364
because at that particular time,

02:42.655 --> 03:03.364
there weren't many introduced.

03:05.788 --> 03:10.975
And

03:05.788 --> 03:10.975
the tax

03:13.958 --> 03:20.004
bill was the main thing that took up most of the 
time. What kind of power, in your opinion, did

03:22.066 --> 03:26.611
Price Daniel have over the House? That was like his 
last year as governor. Price Daniel, senior. Yes.

03:32.717 --> 03:34.359
Oh, I thought he did well. I think Price Daniel, 
senior, was one of our better governors. I

03:39.164 --> 03:40.665
happened to be on his team. Maybe that's why I think 
so. He gave me most everything I asked for. In fact,

03:47.983 --> 03:53.388
my daughter worked for him, too. Peggy worked for 
him. Oh, really? During the summer. I noticed

03:58.773 --> 03:59.674
that. She

03:59.794 --> 04:14.087
was secretary at two of his

03:59.794 --> 04:14.087
people that were newspaper people. And she made 
out the certificates at the Admiral of the Navy and

04:15.788 --> 04:23.418
et cetera.

04:28.205 --> 04:29.907
Can I tell you a little joke on it? Mm-hmm. Well, 
John wasn't too old at that time either, you know.

04:37.677 --> 04:44.867
And so she got a blank, and she filled it out, making 
it. John David, king of the apes of the Congo.

04:55.027 --> 05:02.921
And she mailed it officially, put Price Daniels, 
she signed, had authority to sign Price Daniels'

04:55.027 --> 05:02.921
name. She signed Price Daniels' name to it and sent 
it to him. Oh, it made him so mad. It made him so mad. I

05:13.298 --> 05:19.725
read that he was mascot your first session also, 
John David.

05:22.868 --> 05:29.134
Your first session I also read in the journal that 
LBJ spoke in front of the House a lot. What kind of

05:31.096 --> 05:42.208
influence did he have over the Texas House, and how 
did the Texas House help him in his running for

05:31.096 --> 05:42.208
presidency?

05:44.230 --> 05:53.859
Before that time, you could not hold a public 
office and

05:44.230 --> 05:53.859
run for another one. Well, we passed a bill with the 
Senate that you could. That made him then eligible

06:02.927 --> 06:13.917
to run for the president. That bill

06:15.314 --> 06:30.388
was passed in no time. He wanted it. He got it. Was 
that like for almost anything he wanted? I

06:37.754 --> 06:43.579
wouldn't say that, but he never did ask for it. Oh, 
he didn't ask for this? Yeah, he had to have this to

06:45.402 --> 06:48.826
run for president. He was running for president. 
Then, of course, Jack Kennedy was nominated

06:51.270 --> 07:00.642
president, and then Kennedy asked him to be his 
vice president. And this gave him authority to do

07:02.164 --> 07:04.807
that, this bill did.

07:09.433 --> 07:10.735
I read that you were the... campaign chairman for 
rural texans for johnson and humphrey um what area

07:11.187 --> 07:39.692
of texas is involved this is the whole state the 
whole state so um what kind of things did you do well

07:11.187 --> 07:39.692
i got uh people from every county that uh put had one 
man from every county to uh get out and support uh

07:39.993 --> 07:47.180
like the county judge or the most of what I would 
think would be the most influential people. And

07:47.200 --> 07:48.982
then I traveled a lot. And I guess the greatest 
thing of that time, the best thing that I did was

07:49.763 --> 08:09.662
asking

07:49.763 --> 08:09.662
Dan Blocker, who we called Hawks Cartwright, to 
come down on a weekend and travel and make

08:11.752 --> 08:12.513
speeches. I had a man in Fort Worth that would 
furnish a plane,

08:13.734 --> 08:27.952
and he would come down on Friday or Saturday 
morning early. We'd throw him out of Hollywood

08:29.174 --> 08:31.336
down here. Maybe that weekend I was going to start 
out for work. We're at that time forward.

08:50.241 --> 08:51.683
Fair was going on. And so we flew in there and 
started out there and making he made speeches.

09:00.432 --> 09:02.034
Johnson. And we do that. We're not we. He drew the 
crowds. People just Those thousands would come

09:09.616 --> 09:15.383
just to hear him and see him in person. Was he from 
Texas? Oh, yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. Wow.

09:22.011 --> 09:25.955
How did you get that chairmanship? Did Johnson ask 
you? Johnson and some of his people knew that I knew

09:28.218 --> 09:38.290
lots of people over the state. When I worked on it, I 
would work hard. I wouldn't, you know. That's kind

09:45.122 --> 09:46.244
of braggadocious.

09:49.108 --> 09:58.002
And he

09:49.108 --> 09:58.002
was a very good speaker. Very good speaker. 
Blocker? Uh-huh.

10:03.931 --> 10:08.057
And I never will forget, we had... meeting in the 
temple. And we filled that whole square up with

10:12.181 --> 10:16.787
prayer in the temple. And when we landed, a little 
girl out at the airport, a little girl came up and

10:16.807 --> 10:26.479
gave him some flowers. And she just reached over 
and did this. And she ran back to her mother saying,

10:29.383 --> 10:32.847
Mama, I touched him. I touched him. I touched

10:33.648 --> 10:37.453
him. So apparently did he do in Corpus Christi was 
very, very large. And the valley was very large. By

10:48.156 --> 10:49.157
having an airplane. We didn't we didn't tear it 
along in these places. One all day affair by any

10:55.763 --> 10:59.767
means, we tried to make at least five. And we did 
this. I believe five weekends previous to the

11:03.570 --> 11:07.914
election. Hmm. Um, so rural Texans or Texans 
really liked LBJ. What did they think of him? What

11:15.717 --> 11:16.939
did, in your opinion?

11:19.822 --> 11:32.879
Well, he carried counties that, uh, that had gone 
Republican

11:19.822 --> 11:32.879
previous all the time. And he carried, he carried 
the counties. I don't remember the votes. It's,

11:38.791 --> 11:41.053
That's a long go. But actually,

11:41.073 --> 11:56.889
you know, you'd want your native son to be 
president or vice president.

12:02.195 --> 12:05.338
I would set up these meetings. whether the county 
judges or the district judge, or the

12:06.989 --> 12:19.464
district attorney in the county and the 
surrounding counties.

12:23.028 --> 12:25.651
You know, bring people see people got there. We had 
had it on radio and TV, etc. In our history class, we

12:34.175 --> 12:50.156
learned that what LBJ called his great society 
programs, a lot of domestic programs, how did it

12:34.175 --> 12:50.156
affect Texas and rural America and the cities? 
Well, the greatest thing that he did for the rural

12:51.738 --> 13:01.772
people is the REA. And what is that? Rural 
electricity.

13:12.128 --> 13:16.692
What we call like a blue body co-op. Oh, like a 
co-op? Yeah, but the REA was the mother of the whole

13:18.995 --> 13:23.879
thing. They

13:26.302 --> 13:33.088
furnished, they formed the co-ops. And

13:34.756 --> 13:47.650
he tried to get the private utilities to run 
electricity to the farmers, but he didn't. So he

13:48.390 --> 13:53.776
got some money, federal money. And then they 
formed these co-ops, like Blue Bonnie, . And

14:03.207 --> 14:07.912
Pertinallis was the largest, Bluebonnet's 
largest now. I didn't know that. And I guess

14:11.936 --> 14:17.882
Pertinallis, I did have a list of them here, but I 
mean, somewhat. Pertinallis is second, and then

14:19.164 --> 14:22.307
they go on down.

14:27.633 --> 14:32.758
In the 58th, well, the second session that you were 
in the House of Representatives, I noticed that

14:33.127 --> 14:44.757
there were a lot of bills passed through the House 
for improvement of colleges and universities and

14:33.127 --> 14:44.757
school districts, like pertaining to special 
services and teacher salaries and textbooks.

14:45.278 --> 14:45.538
That's right. What kind of impact did it have on, 
like, Lee, Bastrop, and Burleson counties? Well,

14:52.264 --> 14:58.189
it just brought in more money for the counties, 
like the teachers' pay raise. The speaker was a

15:02.506 --> 15:11.195
James A. Turman had his doctorate, graduated to 
Commerce. And he was full, wholehearted for the

15:11.215 --> 15:16.040
teachers. Consequently, he did all he could for 
the teachers and for schools. And that's the

15:23.568 --> 15:30.876
reason that there's more done in that session at 
that particular time for schools and school

15:31.058 --> 15:32.619
teachers. However, he did not get as much as he 
wanted, because at that particular time,

15:33.180 --> 15:47.572
the House and Senate both were very conservative.

15:50.755 --> 15:57.941
Did this area have new school buildings built or 
anything like that, just mostly salaries? Mostly

15:58.681 --> 16:00.863
salaries, I'd say. I don't remember whether there 
were any new school buildings at that particular

16:02.362 --> 16:11.937
time built

16:02.362 --> 16:11.937
or not. I just don't remember.

16:16.043 --> 16:29.905
As the deputy commissioner in the Ag Department 
and as a legislator, how did Texas react to the

16:16.043 --> 16:29.905
civil rights as far as in the House and in the 
Agriculture Department? Because this was the

16:30.577 --> 16:32.799
time of big civil rights. Well,

16:34.661 --> 16:52.820
I think it,

16:34.661 --> 16:52.820
I believe it went along fairly well because they

16:34.661 --> 16:52.820
started hiring blacks and Mexican Americans. In 
fact, I did the hiring in the agriculture

16:55.003 --> 17:00.128
department.

17:01.947 --> 17:28.528
and i hired quite a few blacks and uh and mexican 
americans and

17:01.947 --> 17:28.528
uh of course nationally i would get to get to higher 
educated people that hold higher higher jobs for

17:01.947 --> 17:28.528
instance uh ernesto de leon from from 
Brownsville. He was a graduate from A&M. He was out

17:35.074 --> 17:36.936
in West Texas. And I went out there and talked to him 
into coming with us. And he just quit. Just quit.

17:49.991 --> 17:59.983
He traveled a lot into Mexico and Central America, 
selling cattle to Texas.

18:05.043 --> 18:12.873
As far as civil rights, was the House conservative 
or liberal about passing it? It was still

18:12.893 --> 18:14.034
conservative. I knew they had to pass it, but it was 
still conservative.

18:25.128 --> 18:34.560
Then when

18:25.128 --> 18:34.560
I started the first...

18:35.418 --> 18:43.388
equal rights committee in the state

18:35.418 --> 18:43.388
departments.

18:46.031 --> 19:03.872
I selected two whites, two Anglos, I mean two

18:46.031 --> 19:03.872
blacks, and two Mexican-Americans.

19:06.451 --> 19:34.365
And if any of the people that we had hired out in the 
fields

19:06.451 --> 19:34.365
had a quarrel with their boss or they had trouble of 
various kinds, they would take this to this

19:06.451 --> 19:34.365
committee. And the committee would vote which was 
right, which was wrong. And we did not, I

19:42.390 --> 19:52.624
didn't fire anybody if this committee said it was 
right.

19:57.250 --> 19:58.211
Were these men? It was women, too. Oh, women, too? 
Well, I'll tell you who. This lady. She's working

20:06.239 --> 20:07.020
there. She left now, Black Lady Lois Jones. I had 
her on the committee. And I didn't put the

20:13.288 --> 20:19.677
hierarchy on this committee. I put various people 
of degrees of labor. You know, people that did the

20:29.089 --> 20:36.178
common labor and some of the... I believe it was two 
people out of,

20:37.441 --> 20:48.217
two or three, two, I guess, out of the main office. 
The rest of them were scattered around the state on

20:50.540 --> 21:05.743
this committee, and they would meet every month to 
discuss what they thought was right, how they

20:50.540 --> 21:05.743
thought things were going, and equal rights. 
After I did that, some of the rest of the

21:07.124 --> 21:14.893
departments followed. Did you hire a lot of women, 
or was this an area that women just didn't get into

21:14.913 --> 21:20.961
yet? No, we hired quite a few women. Like down in the 
valley,

21:26.367 --> 21:35.578
we even put women to testing

21:36.503 --> 21:49.120
scales, testing

21:36.503 --> 21:49.120
gasoline pumps.

21:49.140 --> 21:58.072
Actually, we were kind of leaders in promoting 
women in these jobs.

21:59.033 --> 22:04.080
Well, besides that, can you tell me some other 
things that you felt were important some of the

22:04.330 --> 22:30.827
accomplishments and aims and shortcomings that 
you had as deputy commissioner because you were in

22:04.330 --> 22:30.827
there for a very long time well

22:04.330 --> 22:30.827
uh i i guess one of the biggest things was the tap 
program which uh i thought of that between here and

22:04.330 --> 22:30.827
austin See, I was going back and forth. And when 
you're out riding BCF, you can concentrate.

22:42.101 --> 22:50.572
Anyway, I thought about that, this TAF program, 
which is agricultural products. And then I had

22:50.592 --> 23:02.788
every car that was

22:50.592 --> 23:02.788
controlled by the Department of Agriculture. A 
sign on it. You've seen them,

23:04.100 --> 23:11.731
I know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Some of my friends lobbied, 
teased me, said this is talk about Perrette.

23:22.147 --> 23:22.968
That's a good one. Well... Then we asked... people 
like the egg industry, for instance, to put that on

23:33.245 --> 23:50.289
their cartons so that people would know that that 
was a Texas egg rather than a Louisiana or

23:33.245 --> 23:50.289
Arkansas. And it helped the

23:51.390 --> 23:59.522
Texas poultry industry considerably. How long 
did it take you to instigate this project a

24:03.350 --> 24:30.488
year and a half to talk to all the different we went 
around and talked to i say we the the division

24:03.350 --> 24:30.488
people around and then we put up uh point of 
purchase signs in the stores saying this is a texas

24:03.350 --> 24:30.488
product And we had even had a foul suit against

24:31.733 --> 24:43.126
some Arkansas people. They had, they got a hold of 
it somewhere or another. Tapsig printed on their

24:48.732 --> 24:54.458
cartons and was sending them into Texas. And we 
had, we had the law to trace it down, find it. And we

25:02.041 --> 25:04.545
brought a suit. Of course, they quit. Were these 
products just sold in Texas, or they went out of the

25:06.568 --> 25:12.016
country or just out of the state? Oh, yeah, they 
went out of the state. Did they go out of the

25:14.941 --> 25:16.143
country? Yeah, we sold some stuff to Japan, and we 
sold some stuff to Mexico.

25:31.150 --> 25:35.015
And I love Canada. How did the farmers feel about 
selling it to people outside our country? Oh,

25:39.360 --> 25:42.403
yeah, they liked it. They liked it because they 
were getting the money? Sure, sure, sure. Mexico

25:47.029 --> 25:54.217
bought lots of our cattle. Then we put stations, 
cattle stations, I thought of this between here

26:02.386 --> 26:05.549
and Austin, too. And I asked them. Luckily, I had 
good friends in the house that would help me to get

26:09.193 --> 26:13.497
the money. And

26:14.799 --> 26:29.153
we put cattle stations in Brownsville, Laredo, 
Del Rio, Eagle Pass,

26:14.799 --> 26:29.153
El Paso. And these cattle had to be inspected

26:31.040 --> 26:44.593
by Mexico's vet and our vet. And they would be put in 
these pens, and that's where the inspection would

26:44.613 --> 26:55.364
take place.

26:56.605 --> 26:59.528
So who were the legislators that helped you in the 
House to get things passed?

27:05.906 --> 27:26.055
When I was deputy commissioner, Bill Heatley, 
Paducah,

27:05.906 --> 27:26.055
Sam Collins-Newton,

27:05.906 --> 27:26.055
Bill Hallowell of Grand Chalangin, scattered all 
over. Were these men mostly from rural areas that

27:26.407 --> 27:31.752
your programs would help? But you'd be surprised 
at that

27:33.454 --> 27:42.081
particular time. The city boys would help you 
because a lot of them didn't know anything about

27:42.101 --> 27:48.788
it. And they said, well, Bill, if you know what you 
know and you say it's right, I'll go along with you.

27:55.154 --> 27:55.654
I'll vote with you. I just luckily had to trust it 
enough to do it.

28:05.290 --> 28:13.438
As Deputy Commissioner, what kind of impact did 
LBJ have on the Agriculture Department of Texas?

28:16.161 --> 28:17.923
Did he help you all out in any way? We asked for 
something in particular, but we never did ask him

28:18.644 --> 28:23.389
for much of anything. He asked us. Oh, really? 
Yeah, he asked us to get some... pecan trees out of

28:28.490 --> 28:35.821
Mexico, and some grapefruit trees out of Mexico.

28:40.608 --> 28:45.755
How did the Vietnam War affect the agriculture 
department? Not really? No. I noticed, I tried to

28:50.642 --> 28:56.050
find some information like in the local papers and 
things like that, And I could hardly find anything

28:57.633 --> 29:01.418
about what was happening in Texas. It was like they 
just wrote about Vietnam. How did you promote,

29:06.385 --> 29:13.474
what other ways did you promote some of the ag 
programs and get the information to the people?

29:15.276 --> 29:18.120
Because it didn't seem like they had that much in 
the papers. I'll tell you what. We had...

29:26.303 --> 29:33.154
We were what we call tap luncheons.

29:33.174 --> 29:35.217
And we had one in New York. We had one in

29:35.277 --> 29:44.291
all over the state and the larger towns. And it 
would be nothing served but Texas products.

29:54.839 --> 30:06.156
And we would invite out-of-town, out-of-state 
people to these luncheons.

30:07.057 --> 30:08.299
Have you ever heard of Ms. Corbett? Well, now, she 
helped me. She really helped me. In fact, she was in

30:14.428 --> 30:17.532
New York. We were putting this on in New York. And I 
wasn't there. I was in the Valley.

30:25.670 --> 30:27.272
And she finally got a hold of me. And Ben Bayesden 
was chief of marketing who did Seahawks.

30:42.807 --> 30:48.353
And we shipped so many steaks to New York. I've 
forgotten how many it was. Anyway,

30:50.815 --> 30:55.660
she finally got a hold of me in, I believe it was in 
Michigan,

30:56.399 --> 31:14.084
and she said, Bill, these states are not worth what 
we're trying to do.

31:17.549 --> 31:18.831
Well, I said, I'll tell you what you do. You call the 
packing I said, we've been buying these sticks

31:24.648 --> 31:27.592
from here in Texas. And tell them to airmail you the 
kind of the sticks that you want. And that I,

31:35.121 --> 31:44.172
certain man there, I said, tell them that I told you 
to do it so you'd be sure that they'd get their

31:35.121 --> 31:44.172
money. And she did. She gave these other sticks 
away.

31:54.213 --> 32:00.762
And Miss Cook up here at Austin, she put on, she 
helped us too. Because it promoted their name.

32:08.592 --> 32:15.521
And I guess the largest one we had was in Dallas.

32:15.561 --> 32:16.582
Unless it had been New York. I wasn't that one in New 
York.

32:23.251 --> 32:23.832
Where... I believe it was during the State Fair, 
where these out-of-town people, buyers, would be

32:24.689 --> 32:40.190
invited to come to taste these Texas products. And 
we sold lots of them. And the people that sold them

32:45.337 --> 32:52.927
were Texas people. And of course, they were there, 
too. And then we had another thing there at the

32:55.300 --> 33:04.212
State Fair in Dallas where we promoted the TAP 
program. They had one big building up there.

33:11.162 --> 33:15.388
Now, don't take this at heart, but A&M had it. They 
called us.

33:22.199 --> 33:26.706
They talked to Ben Bayesden, and Ben said he'd like 
to talk to me. So we met them up there at this

33:27.908 --> 33:32.154
building. What A&M was doing, they were

33:33.796 --> 33:48.358
in this building showing Grandma's canned peas 
and Grandma's canned... fruits and vegetables

33:50.009 --> 33:57.059
and

33:50.009 --> 33:57.059
fodder and corn and stuff like that. Well, it 
wasn't drawing people into the building. And

34:03.008 --> 34:07.474
naturally, they wanted people to come to the fair. 
So they turned the building over to us five. And

34:12.782 --> 34:18.430
then we went out and got... Blue Bell, all over the 
valley, people that manufactured and canned

34:19.169 --> 34:28.382
fruits and vegetables in East Texas. Then

34:28.843 --> 34:48.872
we'd have a

34:28.843 --> 34:48.872
school choir would come in one weekend or maybe on a 
certain day or maybe another band state where

34:49.122 --> 34:56.575
these things were manufactured. And that drew a 
lot of people into the building. And

35:02.946 --> 35:13.425
we had a room set off where out of state people would 
come. and where we could talk to them and get the

35:13.912 --> 35:21.802
sellers and buyers together. Where a lot of 
produce was,

35:21.822 --> 35:30.473
like turkeys and things, all kinds. Is there a tap 
building at the fair? Yeah. Now? Yeah. Do you feel

35:37.783 --> 35:41.708
like this program is still successful? It can be 
made successful as hard as the people want to make

35:42.346 --> 35:46.170
it. In fact, John White, a gentleman from Dallas,

35:47.911 --> 36:08.792
before all this Iran

35:47.911 --> 36:08.792
stuff started, they went to the embassy in Iran, in 
Washington.

36:10.763 --> 36:28.041
had just about completed trading

36:10.763 --> 36:28.041
produce, Texas agricultural products, for oil. 
And then all that stuff blew up over there. But

36:32.626 --> 36:39.994
first, the federal government came along and told 
us that we could not do that. A state, a lone state,

36:40.278 --> 36:50.993
cannot trade or barter with a foreign country. It 
has to go through the federal government. Well,

36:55.459 --> 37:03.130
then you come along with the wheat people would be 
against it because they wouldn't have enough

36:55.459 --> 37:03.130
wheat. We didn't raise these other states' rates 
and stuff like that. So consequently, they

37:09.801 --> 37:13.105
knocked it in the head to start with. But we would 
have sold lots and lots of Texas products if that

37:13.586 --> 37:18.812
could have gone through. Did y'all do that with any 
other countries or go through the federal?

37:24.019 --> 37:24.199
Couldn't. The federal government wouldn't let 
us. Did you ever go through the federal government

37:25.481 --> 37:31.308
to sell to other countries? In Mexico, we did 
cattle, yeah. And, uh, we went to, uh, we would ship

37:34.480 --> 37:55.911
cattle to, uh, Burma and to, uh, Australia, to, uh, 
uh, some of the Far East, uh, countries. They

37:56.973 --> 37:59.396
would, uh, we shipped those. We flew them out of, 
uh, Houston, all over. Even cattle that these

38:05.665 --> 38:14.252
people bought in Amarillo would be brought to 
Houston.

38:16.634 --> 38:31.968
I've seen goats, sheep, hogs, cattle, horses, 
astroturf,

38:16.634 --> 38:31.968
all kinds of seed put in one plane. Brammer cattle. 
Oh my goodness. You were mentioning A&M, and since

38:39.010 --> 38:48.040
I'm from A&M, how did the universities have an 
impact on the agricultural department? I noticed

38:48.841 --> 39:03.397
that like for the TAP program, what I read about it 
was as far as seeds and other kind of things, A&M had

38:48.841 --> 39:03.397
a part in it, University of Texas, Texas Tech. Did 
they help you all a lot at all? To be honest and

39:06.618 --> 39:12.327
straight with you, he and him were jealous of us. 
Why? Because we thought of this program. And

39:17.134 --> 39:21.882
because we were making hay with it. And I don't know 
whether Black's still over there or not.

39:25.267 --> 39:26.028
Professor Black? I don't know. And I know he made 
the remark around the state that that wasn't nice

39:30.315 --> 39:33.840
and all. In fact, one of them asked me, he said, oh, 
y'all will give that up soon, won't you? What they

39:38.967 --> 39:48.057
want to do, they want us to give it up so they can get 
it.

39:48.077 --> 39:53.703
But I never did call on them for anything. Like 
Tarleton was great on peaches. That's part of

39:58.368 --> 40:02.934
painting, yeah? And some of those... schools,

40:05.680 --> 40:17.732
Texas Tech, they would help us with things that we 
might need, help us find things. And A&M did too,

40:18.853 --> 40:33.207
but A&M, they were kind of the hierarchy, not 
the...

40:18.853 --> 40:33.207
With the diversity of the state,

40:18.853 --> 40:33.207
what Where did y'all center on most of the time? 
Like Central Texas, East Texas, West Texas? I

40:40.189 --> 40:41.892
mean, all over? We had people all over the state. 
But y'all didn't really center on any area? No.

40:49.503 --> 40:52.647
Like cattle, mostly East Texas and South Texas. 
Wasn't too many from West Texas. There's a few.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.181
There's a lot of sheep and goats out of West Texas. 
that went through the Del Rio pens.

41:11.203 --> 41:18.593
What other projects did you help instigate when 
you were deputy commissioner? Any other biggies?

41:22.057 --> 41:24.280
I might think so, Matthew Lee.

41:26.323 --> 41:34.193
Those two were the, no question about it, the two of 
them, it took lots of time, lots of,

41:37.750 --> 41:46.624
That's where we spent most of our money, because it 
was helping the farmer.

41:52.234 --> 41:53.916
Well, seed.

41:57.001 --> 42:02.290
In our seed program, we tested seed in Mexico. 
You'd go out here, you had

42:02.692 --> 42:10.364
maize. Well, just as soon as your maize was 
harvested and cured, tested, we'd go to Mexico

42:12.748 --> 42:26.070
with it and plant

42:12.748 --> 42:26.070
it. That way, we could tell this grower

42:32.493 --> 42:41.645
what the percent of his, it was county, you know, 
and we had a fellow still doing it too, a fellow

42:32.493 --> 42:41.645
named Williams. He's Mexican, but he's,

42:42.386 --> 42:48.695
I ain't gonna look at him. He got Mexican, you know, 
he owns part of the land down there. He lives down

42:54.463 --> 42:55.064
there.

42:59.790 --> 43:01.352
We could give him the percentage. you can get the 
tag and say percentage of the way it looked,

43:01.670 --> 43:15.943
foreign seed that was in

43:01.670 --> 43:15.943
it. And our people would go down there and stay and 
plant it and watch it. They'd come home for a week or

43:22.810 --> 43:29.196
two and go back for it.

43:32.568 --> 43:38.113
We had a seed lab in Houston, which wasn't 
anything, not anything. So I talked to a team, gave

43:38.134 --> 43:49.325
me the money, put up this seed lab. Of course, the 
seed people, they wanted up McGregor because that

43:50.646 --> 43:59.875
is just about the center of the seed growing in a lot 
of south, a lot of west, a lot of not much east, but up

44:00.833 --> 44:14.157
in Vernon and places like that. Well, since I had 
the money, I could say where I wanted it.

44:19.767 --> 44:24.533
Consequently, I said, well, I'm going to put it in 
my hometown, and I gave some reasons. I said, well,

44:24.693 --> 44:41.775
at that time, I said we had trains coming through, 
and we had four truck lines crisscrossing here,

44:24.693 --> 44:41.775
you know, and we could get better service than off, 
like McGregor, off on one main highway. And we

44:43.137 --> 44:46.281
had...

44:48.691 --> 44:52.896
the labor that we can get to do it.
