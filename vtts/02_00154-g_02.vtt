WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:04.657
Administration of an institution.

00:07.160 --> 00:07.961
From the inside.

00:10.984 --> 00:14.007
Mr Rudder was still president in those years.

00:18.371 --> 00:19.672
And I was able to.

00:22.815 --> 00:27.880
Increase I was able to see his leadership 
qualities. Close up.

00:32.752 --> 00:39.239
One of my primary tasks was to review all masters 
and doctoral thesis proposals.

00:43.443 --> 01:02.202
That service broadened my understanding

00:43.443 --> 01:02.202
and introduced me to a

00:43.443 --> 01:02.202
broader variety of scholars and their research 
techniques.

01:11.935 --> 01:21.348
I literally read the proposals and often offered 
suggestions for improvement. Similarly, I

01:21.368 --> 01:34.247
appointed the graduate council representatives 
on all doctoral committees

01:21.368 --> 01:34.247
and used the technique of marking each appointees 
name in the graduate catalog and trying to select

01:35.054 --> 01:52.731
individuals from all across the campus to serve on 
doctoral programs in a discipline far removed

01:35.054 --> 01:52.731
from theirs. A task in which they were expected to

01:55.053 --> 02:02.901
report to Dr. Hall regarding the appropriate

02:04.636 --> 02:32.550
quality

02:04.636 --> 02:32.550
and thoroughness of the

02:04.636 --> 02:32.550
candidate's examination,

02:04.636 --> 02:32.550
preliminary and final examinations as well as the 
dissertation.

02:41.971 --> 03:00.057
When I appointed myself to one of those 
committees,

02:41.971 --> 03:00.057
I soon developed a pair of standard questions to 
ask the candidate while I watched the members

03:03.682 --> 03:11.752
of the committee

03:03.682 --> 03:11.752
who were from the student's major department. One 
of the questions was to inquire, quote, if you had

03:11.772 --> 03:31.377
known at the time you began your graduate studies 
all that you know now about the quality of the

03:11.772 --> 03:31.377
programs in your

03:11.772 --> 03:31.377
area of specialization.

03:34.816 --> 04:01.144
to what institutions would you have applied for 
admission other than Texas A&M and why would you

03:34.816 --> 04:01.144
have been interested in those programs or in other 
words what are the outstanding programs in your

03:34.816 --> 04:01.144
specialty

03:34.816 --> 04:01.144
period quote

03:34.816 --> 04:01.144
the other question

04:04.837 --> 04:21.393
was directed at

04:04.837 --> 04:21.393
learning the student's acquaintance with the 
areas of publication in the specialty.

04:24.136 --> 04:34.506
So there I asked,

04:24.136 --> 04:34.506
quote, in order to obtain the highest scholarly 
acclaim

04:36.275 --> 04:57.380
and benefit for your

04:36.275 --> 04:57.380
scholarly reputation,

04:36.275 --> 04:57.380
to what journal will you send perhaps a chapter of 
your dissertation? For public journal or

04:57.961 --> 05:04.088
journals, will you send portions of your 
dissertation And to what press, either

05:05.570 --> 05:22.394
profit-making or university-related, will you 
send the manuscript in the hope that they will

05:05.570 --> 05:22.394
accept it as a book?"

05:29.064 --> 05:33.130
One day, after

05:29.064 --> 05:33.130
I served I believe a year and a half, Bill Barzac 
told me that one day after coffee that he thought he

05:35.067 --> 05:45.900
was going to resign his position and go back to 
English. That administration quote really

05:47.222 --> 05:56.112
wasn't his cup of tea, period quote. That 
afternoon, Dr. Hall invited me in and then

05:56.132 --> 06:03.201
inquired about my interest in serving as the 
associate dean of the graduate school on a

06:03.974 --> 06:09.019
full-time basis.

06:14.985 --> 06:30.741
I responded by asking him if there was any plan in 
the future to select a full-time dean of the

06:14.985 --> 06:30.741
graduate school since he was serving as both Vice 
President of Academic Affairs and Graduate

06:32.830 --> 06:42.540
Dean. When he responded that he thought that might 
happen within a year, I was encouraged,

06:42.740 --> 06:59.698
but continued with the inquiry About whether or 
not quote anyone. From liberal arts. Would be

07:06.737 --> 07:09.140
considered for that position. Period quote. My 
hopes were dashed when he indicate when he. Told me

07:19.490 --> 07:20.491
that. There had already been a decision made. But 
the new graduate Dean would come from

07:25.416 --> 07:28.639
agriculture. So I told him I should not, I did not 
want to

07:30.273 --> 07:40.125
remain in the subordinate position.

07:44.010 --> 08:00.229
George Kunze was soon announced as the new 
graduate dean, and Dr. Hall asked me if I would stay

07:44.010 --> 08:00.229
for a year to work with Dr. Kunze, which I did, and 
from which I benefited in terms of experience

08:00.547 --> 08:06.513
greatly. Paragraph.

08:10.897 --> 08:28.073
So it was an old friend who called me one afternoon 
in the fall of 1970 to

08:10.897 --> 08:28.073
ask if I was acquainted with Jack McKinney 
Williams a Southern historian who had gotten his

08:29.993 --> 08:40.085
PhD at Emory University in Atlanta, who had just 
been selected as president of Texas A&M

08:29.993 --> 08:40.085
University.

08:43.269 --> 08:57.807
I told him that I knew who Dr. Williams was and that 
possibly we had shaken hands a time or two at the

08:43.269 --> 08:57.807
Southern Historical Association Convention, 
but that I did not know him well. except to have

08:59.187 --> 09:15.588
heard very positive things about Dr. Williams, 
both as a historian and a leader of Texas higher

08:59.187 --> 09:15.588
education during his days as commissioner.

09:19.033 --> 09:27.844
Paragraph, the next step

09:19.033 --> 09:27.844
in life-changing events came soon after Dr. 
Williams arrived

09:30.423 --> 09:59.822
When I read a note,

09:30.423 --> 09:59.822
a brief note

09:30.423 --> 09:59.822
from the new president, which informed me that one

09:30.423 --> 09:59.822
of the last things that he had done before leaving 
Knoxville was to chat with his doctoral

09:30.423 --> 09:59.822
dissertation advisor, Bell Wiley.

10:04.612 --> 10:22.091
who had been one of our advisory editors with the 
Jeff Davis Project

10:04.612 --> 10:22.091
and whom I knew as one of the finest

10:04.612 --> 10:22.091
historians and friends I would ever meet.

10:25.475 --> 10:34.365
The note from Dr. Williams informed me that Dr. 
Wiley had told him that when he got to College

10:25.475 --> 10:34.365
Station, if he, quote, wanted to talk to a faculty 
member who seemed well acquainted all across the

10:35.729 --> 11:04.403
campus

10:35.729 --> 11:04.403
and might be a source for information about

10:35.729 --> 11:04.403
the faculty and their goals, that he should talk 
with Haskell Munroe. period quote. Thus, Dr.

11:08.614 --> 11:21.049
Williams asked me to call his secretary, Nelda, 
and come over for a visit.

11:21.069 --> 11:35.065
When I called that always reliable, careful, and 
caring lady, she gave me an appointment at 4.45 in

11:21.069 --> 11:35.065
the afternoon, which I thought was a hint at a brief 
and comparatively meaningless chat.

11:48.743 --> 12:02.706
That expectation

11:48.743 --> 12:02.706
was forever erased

11:48.743 --> 12:02.706
when we finished our delightful visit At least two 
hours after it began. As

12:07.232 --> 12:15.143
I was about to walk out the doorway, Doctor 
Williams put his hand on my shoulder. And asked me

12:17.206 --> 12:20.731
if I would quote ever be interested. In serving as a 
member of the A&M administration period quote.

12:30.244 --> 12:30.945
Without much. Preparation. I responded. But I had 
not mentioned it to anybody else, but that yes, I

12:36.843 --> 12:40.987
thought I would.

12:49.136 --> 12:49.716
Meanwhile.

12:53.220 --> 12:54.702
More changes were underway.

12:58.005 --> 13:00.047
Because Jack Williams. came with broad academic 
experience and insight and was able to build

13:01.006 --> 13:26.862
a lofty structure,

13:01.006 --> 13:26.862
a lofty institutional structure on the strong and 
solid foundation which only Earl Rudder could

13:01.006 --> 13:26.862
have built.

13:31.145 --> 13:37.973
In hindsight, the Rudder Williams years became 
Camelot on the brasses.

13:40.816 --> 13:43.379
Only Earl Rudder could have done what he did.

13:46.182 --> 13:50.827
And only Jack Williams could have done what he did. 
Neither could have accomplished the other's

13:52.689 --> 13:57.675
victories.

14:00.237 --> 14:09.188
And both were uniquely prepared

14:00.237 --> 14:09.188
for their time and place.

14:12.412 --> 14:26.970
Jack Williams had marvelous personal qualities 
as a speaker, as a public speaker,

14:29.498 --> 14:31.281
An individual with. Strong connections. In 
Austin and in Washington. Especially with the

14:39.574 --> 14:40.936
federal. Agencies relating to our education.

14:47.667 --> 14:50.592
His record of assisting. The separate the. 
Historically black. Land-grant schools in the

14:55.259 --> 14:57.042
South. was little known but truly important.

15:05.842 --> 15:16.857
Also during those years

15:05.842 --> 15:16.857
the president of Texas A&M was also the president 
of the A&M system. Thus there was no contention in

15:18.238 --> 15:27.771
almost all of Mr. Rutter's years

15:18.238 --> 15:27.771
and William's time until 1976

15:30.046 --> 15:45.936
over where the experiment stations and extension 
services, other state agencies reported. There

15:45.957 --> 15:51.447
was one chief executive officer and everyone knew 
it.

15:55.493 --> 16:00.821
Horace Byers had replaced Wayne Hall as Vice 
President for Academic Affairs. Dr. Byers, a

16:02.384 --> 16:19.170
nationally and internationally known scholar in 
the geosciences, came from the University of

16:02.384 --> 16:19.170
Chicago and increased the pace of progress which 
Wayne Hall had begun. He retired not long after Dr.

16:24.822 --> 16:50.550
Williams' arrival

16:24.822 --> 16:50.550
and was replaced by John C. Calhoun, Jr.,

16:24.822 --> 16:50.550
a marvelously

16:24.822 --> 16:50.550
skillful leader with truly unique capability.

16:50.570 --> 16:52.872
A native of Pennsylvania, Dr. Calhoun

16:55.687 --> 17:24.664
had begun his studies at what was then the 
Pennsylvania State College in petroleum

16:55.687 --> 17:24.664
engineering

16:55.687 --> 17:24.664
and soon after completion of his doctoral studies 
earned worldwide recognition as a truly

16:55.687 --> 17:24.664
innovative and creative

16:55.687 --> 17:24.664
thinker regarding oil

17:25.640 --> 17:38.134
regarding petroleum location, exploration, and 
recovery. He had come to A&M in the 1950s as dean of

17:38.154 --> 17:52.069
engineering, had served in the Kennedy 
administration as science advisor to the

17:38.154 --> 17:52.069
Secretary of Interior,

17:54.462 --> 18:09.020
And thus he too brought broad scope to the 
administration.

18:09.040 --> 18:20.674
All of that began to link to me.

18:21.294 --> 18:23.457
And near the end of 19... 71 and the beginning of 
1972. That

18:28.348 --> 18:49.798
first year of Dr. Williams had been marked by a 
change, by an enormous increase in enrollment of

18:28.348 --> 18:49.798
coeds because he had

18:52.765 --> 19:10.510
informed the board of directors that he would not 
accept their invitation

18:52.765 --> 19:10.510
to come to College Station as president of A&M 
unless they would allow

18:52.765 --> 19:10.510
him to create a woman's dormitory.

19:15.557 --> 19:20.865
When they assured him they would back his 
selection of an architect, And planning to build

19:21.335 --> 19:23.258
such a structure.

19:25.982 --> 19:32.170
He noted that he wanted them to approve his 
identification.

19:35.856 --> 19:36.577
As he began. His service on November 1, 1970. Have a 
an existing dormitory. To be reserved for women

19:48.173 --> 19:50.076
only.

19:52.807 --> 19:58.973
when the spring semester began in 1971.

20:01.355 --> 20:19.152
As word of that decision spread, women filled that 
dormitory

20:01.355 --> 20:19.152
and everyone became aware that there were no 
hindrances to women's enrollment at A&M in any

20:01.355 --> 20:19.152
manner.

20:23.705 --> 20:46.877
Almost exactly a year later,

20:23.705 --> 20:46.877
I came to my office in Nagel Hall

20:23.705 --> 20:46.877
after returning from North Carolina with Joe

20:23.705 --> 20:46.877
and our children.

20:53.388 --> 21:04.867
Among the notes in my box was a request that I return 
a phone call to the office of Vice President

20:53.388 --> 21:04.867
Calhoun.

21:07.972 --> 21:12.339
A gentleman with whom I had little, if any, 
personal acquaintance.

21:19.050 --> 21:20.172
The secretary. responded to my call by indicating 
that Dr Calhoun had been trying

21:21.670 --> 21:35.645
without success to reach me for a number of days.

21:40.551 --> 21:49.821
She accepted my explanation of the absence when I 
told her that we had been in North Carolina because

21:50.847 --> 22:07.048
of my wife's stepfather's death and burial, and 
then remained

21:50.847 --> 22:07.048
for Christmas there with her mother.

22:07.068 --> 22:18.964
She indicated that Dr. Calhoun wanted to speak to 
me as soon as I could come over, so I asked what was

22:07.068 --> 22:18.964
the nature of his concern.

22:22.859 --> 22:50.537
With obvious, with a bit of awkwardness, she noted 
that she was unaware of the reason for his

22:22.859 --> 22:50.537
concern

22:22.859 --> 22:50.537
and that usually he

22:22.859 --> 22:50.537
informed her regarding

22:51.040 --> 22:52.763
the nature of important calls.

22:58.433 --> 23:16.103
So as I walked to the Teague building

22:58.433 --> 23:16.103
on the east end of the campus, I wondered what the 
vice president of academic affairs

22:58.433 --> 23:16.103
might ask me to do. Much to my surprise, he invited 
me to join his staff with the title Assistant Vice

23:18.682 --> 23:28.096
President for Academic Affairs.

23:31.902 --> 23:45.583
In that position, I would join him and the 
Associate Vice President, Dr. Richard E.

23:31.902 --> 23:45.583
Winerdi, W-A-I-N-E-R-D-I,

23:31.902 --> 23:45.583
a marvelously talented and always energetic

23:49.867 --> 24:14.691
member of the petroleum engineering faculty

23:49.867 --> 24:14.691
who had studied with Dr. Calhoun first at the 
University of Oklahoma and then completed his

23:49.867 --> 24:14.691
doctoral work with Calhoun back at Penn State.

24:14.711 --> 24:19.435
I asked Dr. Calhoun about my role. For example, did 
he want me to be particularly responsible for

24:23.523 --> 24:35.801
reviewing matters from the humanities, social 
sciences, business, education areas?

24:41.510 --> 24:50.383
He quickly explained

24:41.510 --> 24:50.383
that no, that instead of dividing the task up that 
way, the three of us would be a team working on all

24:51.443 --> 24:58.572
tasks together. I asked him if I could continue to 
teach a survey course.

25:09.426 --> 25:20.320
And he smiled, adding, of course, if you would like 
to do so, but we cannot give you extra compensation

25:09.426 --> 25:20.320
for that effort.

25:24.738 --> 25:51.122
Thus, I continued

25:24.738 --> 25:51.122
the plan to teach every semester

25:24.738 --> 25:51.122
and could begin to honestly state that my 
compensation for that teaching was in my heart,

25:24.738 --> 25:51.122
not my hip pocket.

25:51.142 --> 25:54.745
That service began January of 1942.

25:57.020 --> 26:14.676
and allowed

25:57.020 --> 26:14.676
me to learn

25:57.020 --> 26:14.676
a broad view of all campus efforts. Teaching, 
research, service, committees, coordinating

26:16.237 --> 26:24.985
board, relation to former students, the general 
public, the legislature, public affairs,

26:26.872 --> 26:42.412
athletics, fundraising,

26:26.872 --> 26:42.412
and student leadership.

26:46.817 --> 26:55.208
For anyone who would later serve as a campus-wide

26:46.817 --> 26:55.208
administrator, working with John Calhoun

26:56.808 --> 27:08.844
was the most important and valuable preparation 
that anyone could have. And now, as I am on Deacon

27:10.927 --> 27:20.520
Drive, a block and a half from the house, we will 
terminate this part of this analysis.
