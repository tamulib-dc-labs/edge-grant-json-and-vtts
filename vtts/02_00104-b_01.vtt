00:02.343 --> 00:10.052
When the bugle for Reveille was played, is that a 
true story as far as you know? I don't know. Is that

00:12.234 --> 00:14.176
what's supposed to have happened? Supposedly, 
that's why they called it Reveille. Well, see, I

00:16.999 --> 00:19.522
wasn't there when Reveille was blown every 
morning. And did Reveille come into classrooms

00:20.343 --> 00:24.448
sometimes? Oh, yeah. Just in the mess hall, 
classroom, mess hall, whatever. And everybody

00:31.402 --> 00:33.685
accepted her. Oh, yeah. But nobody paid any 
attention to her. She wasn't handled like she is

00:38.310 --> 00:41.494
now by any means. Do you remember who took care of 
her? Nobody. In the early days? Nobody took care of

00:46.240 --> 00:47.661
her. Where did she sleep? I imagine she went to the 
dormitories at night to be my guest. But nobody had

00:52.808 --> 00:55.210
anything to say. She didn't belong to anybody. She 
cared for herself. Religious activities, were

01:02.975 --> 01:13.995
there

01:02.975 --> 01:13.995
churches, religious activities going on at 
Northgate? Yes, yes. Did you ever attend over

01:15.438 --> 01:16.801
there? I did not, no. I was never there on the 
weekend for that time. Was there a religious

01:21.449 --> 01:23.954
emphasis week in the spring? I think there was, as I 
remember. And in terms of religious affiliation,

01:27.967 --> 01:36.820
there were plenty of Protestants and Catholics. 
Were there some Jewish students, too? Oh, I'm

01:38.763 --> 01:39.344
sure. I'm sure there were. And everybody was 
treated okay? In fact, I expect my company

01:44.993 --> 01:50.361
commander was Jewish. His name was Lefkoski. 
Wouldn't that be Jewish? It wouldn't be. Where was

01:54.427 --> 01:55.528
he from? I don't know. I just saw his picture again a 
while ago. I got a more long one out, just

02:00.254 --> 02:03.822
reminisced a little. At the end of your freshman 
year, did you participate in final review? Oh,

02:08.553 --> 02:09.094
yes. Yeah. Describe that. I guess it was 
mandatory. Describe Final Review in those days.

02:16.101 --> 02:20.707
Well, it was hot as hell for one thing. Well, it was 
just a plain old review, and I think they did the

02:21.729 --> 02:31.082
same thing that I guess they've done forever. The 
seniors watched the last go around and the juniors

02:32.885 --> 02:36.109
took over. I don't think that's changed. I don't 
believe. Did you think you had changed much to move

02:39.793 --> 02:44.579
up from being a fish to being a sophomore? Not 
nearly as much as the guys lived on campus because,

02:45.640 --> 02:51.267
like I told you, I wasn't in any hazing. But I'll 
tell you something else I didn't get. I never got a

02:54.110 --> 02:56.232
demerit while I was in A&M. None. And then not many 
of them lived on campus that could ever stand up.

03:01.466 --> 03:02.730
Yeah, that's right, that's right. So you didn't 
have to march on the quad. Bullring. Bullring, you

03:09.046 --> 03:11.693
didn't have to deal with that. Here comes a lady 
to... Come in. Hello. Patty, this is Mr. Haskell

03:17.297 --> 03:19.804
Monroe. Good to see you. Excuse me for not getting 
up. It's quite all right. Where's the cell?

03:26.522 --> 03:29.470
Patsy's brother-in-law was buried this 
afternoon. Where were we? We're talking about

03:31.921 --> 03:34.404
things on the campus. Did you ever go to the campus 
hospital, to the Quack Shack? No. So you don't

03:38.791 --> 03:43.498
have... Now, it was located over on the north side 
of the campus. It was about, let's see, what's it,

03:44.259 --> 03:53.694
in the chapel there now on the campus? A little 
north of the chapel, wasn't it? Yes, just across

03:55.623 --> 04:08.366
the street, as I remember from the... Now, the 
president then was Walton, and he lived in the old

03:55.623 --> 04:08.366
house across from Sabeasa. That burned. Describe 
Mr. Walton. I didn't know anything about him

04:14.076 --> 04:16.500
particularly. And working in the landscape 
department, I had to work in his garden. So I used to

04:22.710 --> 04:26.434
see him come and go, and he had a black chauffeur. 
And he and I communicated a whole lot more than I did

04:27.916 --> 04:31.560
with the president. Now, what did y'all grow in his 
garden? Flowers. Oh, we had pansies and we had...

04:42.181 --> 04:45.792
this border plant that they use still all over 
campus. All kinds of flowers. Where was the flower

04:48.862 --> 04:50.327
garden? Was it in the back of the to the west side of 
the house, I believe it was. What's at that place

04:56.624 --> 04:59.288
now where that house burned? A dormitory. Oh, is 
it? I believe so. It was a big old two-story house.

05:07.398 --> 05:13.826
And that black boy thought he was some, he couldn't 
touch a mother's dick. What did the students and

05:14.207 --> 05:19.073
all, what did you all think about President 
Walton? I'm not sure that we really thought, had

05:20.470 --> 05:25.820
much think about it. And, Haskell, you know, we 
were way down on the totem pole at that time. When

05:32.371 --> 05:36.218
Mr. Gilchrist came to be the new dean of 
engineering, Did you all see much of him? No.

05:40.143 --> 05:50.232
Occasionally

05:40.143 --> 05:50.232
he would come to some of the engineering classes 
just to make his appearance. I got to know him

05:50.252 --> 05:51.513
fairly well. In fact, later on I knew him extremely 
well being with the highway department. Describe

05:58.239 --> 05:59.980
him in personality. What kind of man was he? Oh, 
pretty headstrong. very

06:06.708 --> 06:15.959
aggressive, very, I would say, very forward 
thinking. He was,

06:16.740 --> 06:20.925
but practical. I thought he was very practical. He 
had some confrontations with some of the students

06:24.789 --> 06:30.656
in certain times. And he won, didn't he? Usually, 
yeah. Like Rutter did, you know. Now, physically,

06:38.456 --> 06:41.160
Mr. Gilchrist was... Big fella. Big fella. And 
this didn't have anything to do with the campus,

06:44.543 --> 07:01.403
but after I became highway district engineer and 
he was with the state, he attended a lot of

06:44.543 --> 07:01.403
functions and I took him to Houston one time And he 
was not bragging, but he seemed to like my driving.

07:09.427 --> 07:13.091
So we got down there, and I was going to have to bring 
him home and then go back. And Mr. Greer told him,

07:13.251 --> 07:18.776
said, Gib, somebody else can take you back to 
Bryan. Save Joe having to go back. He said, Joe will

07:21.579 --> 07:22.941
take me. So Joe took him. Now, those were tough 
depression years. We were just beginning to come

07:31.370 --> 07:36.455
out in 36 when I started. And how important was 
Franklin Roosevelt in affecting people's

07:37.817 --> 07:46.586
attitudes about pulling out of the Depression? I 
think he was as well thought of as anybody of that

07:47.647 --> 07:53.294
day and time. We paraded for him one time, too. 
Describe that. Well, we thought we were really

07:58.336 --> 08:03.644
doing something, but let me tell you what I did. I 
had a camera, and as they brought him up to the

08:03.664 --> 08:21.492
reviewing stand, I took his picture, and they took 
my camera away from me, because he did not want

08:03.664 --> 08:21.492
people to know about his...

08:03.664 --> 08:21.492
Infantile paralysis. His leg problem. His polio. 
All right. How did they get him out of the car up onto

08:24.914 --> 08:27.961
the platform? In a wheelchair. Okay. They put him 
in a chair from the car and had a ramp. They built a

08:33.935 --> 08:35.378
ramp up on there. As far as you could tell, could he 
even walk at all? I didn't see him walk at all, and on

08:40.625 --> 08:52.336
the reviewing stand they had a thing for him to hold 
him up where he could watch as we passed by. But we

08:53.517 --> 08:58.901
thought that was pretty special to review before 
the President of the United States. Did anybody

08:59.262 --> 09:01.784
attempt any kind of pranks that day? No. I know I set 
my camera. How big a crowd was there? There were

09:08.210 --> 09:10.632
lots of people there, lots of people. I think we put 
on a pretty good parade.

09:19.685 --> 09:25.714
Were there other famous people that came to visit 
while you were a student?

09:28.317 --> 09:29.900
Well, Russ Morgan. The big band? Came to, had a 
band. Lucille and I attended at Sabisa Hall. Kay

09:37.628 --> 09:43.977
Kaiser selected the outstanding beauty of the 
year when he was there. In fact, his picture's in my

09:43.997 --> 09:47.902
annual over there. We had one or two others that I 
remember. They used to have some real functions in

09:53.891 --> 09:57.095
that Sabisa Hall. Did you go to any of those dances? 
We did. We went to Russ Morgan, I remember. How were

10:01.201 --> 10:05.266
girls treated in those days at those dances? 
Pretty special. Most of them, as I said, or a lot of

10:07.075 --> 10:14.548
them came, they'd run buses from CIA down there. 
And there were some interesting experiences when

10:14.568 --> 10:20.218
people wrote a letter to a blind date. Yeah, I guess 
so. What did the young women wear to those dances?

10:27.967 --> 10:30.553
They wear formal long dresses? Well, it seemed to 
me like not in it like we call long today. It seemed

10:34.742 --> 10:38.471
to me like most their formal dresses were just 
below knee. I know that's what Lucille would wear.

10:42.239 --> 10:43.883
And how did the boys behave? I think pretty well, I 
think pretty well. Occasionally some of them

10:48.041 --> 10:57.011
would get them up to the dormitory afterward, 
which would get them in trouble, you know. And was

10:57.151 --> 11:02.077
there much drinking at the dances? I just don't 
remember. I expect there was, but I don't remember

11:06.082 --> 11:12.790
of any brawls or this sort of thing in particular. 
And smoking. What were Aggies smoking in those

11:13.919 --> 11:16.383
days? Well, most of them in my condition wasn't 
smoking anything. If there was, they rolled a

11:22.173 --> 11:23.815
bullderm.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.443
They didn't have money for cigarettes. And did, 
students didn't smoke pipes, did they? I think

11:35.112 --> 11:38.116
there were some pipes I remember that were smoked. 
Cigars? Not many, not many. Snuff dippers or

11:43.084 --> 11:45.287
chewing tobacco? I expect there were lots of 
chewing tobacco. I don't remember much snuff.

11:52.097 --> 11:57.185
In fact, this fellow, Mac New, as I remember, 
smoked a pipe all the time. Oh, the faculty members

11:57.205 --> 12:00.610
did, yeah. What did you and your buddies know about 
drugs? That was not even talked about that I ever

12:03.817 --> 12:07.021
remember. Didn't know they existed. I don't guess 
we did. I don't ever remember of it. During those

12:13.429 --> 12:19.217
years, were there any places for married students 
to live on campus? I don't believe so. I didn't

12:20.759 --> 12:21.500
think there were. I don't think so. In fact, there 
weren't many married students. Right, right.

12:27.127 --> 12:30.972
Excuse me just a minute. Hattie, can you handle her 
all right? Oh, yeah. All right. No project houses

12:39.270 --> 12:40.975
or anything. What was over on that land where 
College View Apartments would be built? Was that

12:48.451 --> 12:49.834
just more pasture? I think it must have been 
because the first things they put out there were

12:49.854 --> 12:57.349
some old army barracks. I think it was right after 
the war. That's right. They moved them in there and

13:05.005 --> 13:07.590
students lived in them. The campus 
organizations, what did you and your buddies

13:08.532 --> 13:15.640
think about the Texas Aggie Band? Well, it was 
pretty special, even then. It had lots of respect.

13:24.449 --> 13:25.791
And Yale leaders? Yeah, I remember some of the 
names of the ones that were there. Brody was one of

13:31.357 --> 13:37.223
the ones that I, in fact, I just saw his name in my 
book there a while ago. I don't remember them

13:38.182 --> 13:42.368
wearing white uniforms like they do now. I don't 
know what they wore, but I just don't remember

13:42.909 --> 13:47.755
that. And who did the Aggies want to beat most? You. 
And after that, who would it have been? Well, they

14:00.713 --> 14:02.115
didn't think much of Rice. You know, Rice was sort 
of a high society school.

14:13.492 --> 14:20.001
But we, I guess Texas was really the worst.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.830
I'm trying to think. And out-of-town football 
games, you only went to one in Fort Worth? Fort

14:31.196 --> 14:31.797
Worth. I went to one in Houston. These were my 
senior year. I went to one because we paraded all

14:36.728 --> 14:42.977
the way down Main Street in Houston. And did you go 
to the game? I went to the game, yeah. How did the

14:47.103 --> 14:51.048
crowd react on those court trips? How did they 
react to Aggies marching? It was lined up on all

14:53.952 --> 14:55.495
sides. It really was an attraction for them, 
apparently. Now, did you go to any basketball

15:00.734 --> 15:02.996
games? No. Oh, on campus. At DeWare? At DeWare 
Fieldhouse. Describe going to a game at DeWare

15:07.340 --> 15:09.962
Fieldhouse. Well, it was sort of interesting. If 
you shot too high, it hit the roof. You know, it

15:18.389 --> 15:22.413
wasn't like some of them nowadays. I

15:23.374 --> 15:29.779
don't know anything particularly special about 
it. Wasn't very big. Did y'all make a lot of noise?

15:33.469 --> 15:34.530
Oh, yeah. And it reverberated all over the place, 
you know, without any insulation. And the

15:40.617 --> 15:44.381
baseball stadium was down next to the railroad? 
That's right, right by the side of Kyle Field.

15:48.565 --> 15:51.829
Seats were all tumbledown and in terrible shape. 
Hit a ball very hard, they'd go climb over to the

15:52.629 --> 15:56.914
football field. Please share any recollection 
you have of Colonel Andy.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.697
Let's see.

16:09.871 --> 16:11.974
I don't know of any particular thing. What was he 
like as a person? Well, I didn't have much dealing

16:16.480 --> 16:25.391
with him or around him, not being in the corps, you 
know, and not being in the dormitory. Was he the

16:25.812 --> 16:32.240
corps commandant when you got here, or was he 
coaching some? He must have been coaching. The

16:33.381 --> 16:38.528
commandant was a colonel, a colonel...

16:41.275 --> 16:42.838
It was before Colonel Moore. What was that guy's 
name? He was infantry. Drove a big black Cadillac.

16:52.941 --> 16:57.411
I think that was just my freshman year, and then 
after him came Colonel Moore. Did some of those old

16:57.745 --> 17:02.793
guys tell you all about what it had been like to be in 
World War I? Oh, yeah. If you ever gave them an

17:04.515 --> 17:06.959
opportunity, you know. If they ever stopped in the 
shade somewhere, take ten. Did old former

17:12.468 --> 17:15.953
students come back to visit the campus then? Not

17:15.973 --> 17:21.762
significantly that I remember of. I'll tell you 
who used to tell those stories was those old

17:22.619 --> 17:30.716
sergeants that were in the active army that were 
assigned to the military department. They could

17:30.936 --> 17:32.720
really tell you big stories. Let's see, the Yale 
leaders were special people, weren't they? Did

17:39.874 --> 17:41.758
the singing cadets exist then? I got a picture of 
them over there in that thing. They were there. I

17:47.018 --> 17:50.741
didn't even think about that until I was looking at 
my annual a while ago. They were there in 40. Were

17:54.985 --> 18:00.331
you aware then or later that there were any secret 
fraternities at A&M? No. Never heard of such. Did

18:04.254 --> 18:05.155
you ever hitchhike? Oh, that's the only way you 
went anywhere. Describe Aggie hitchhiking.

18:13.801 --> 18:20.449
The main place that they, the two places they had, 
one was out on 6th to go south. At Eastgate. At

18:21.911 --> 18:22.532
Eastgate. And the other one was in Bryan,

18:23.733 --> 18:39.212
catacombed across from the courthouse where the 
health department is now. There was a church

18:40.113 --> 18:41.395
there. And they're on that corner. And every time 
one walked up, he asked, who's the last one? And he

18:49.821 --> 18:52.406
gave them his number, and then you took the next 
number. And when they came along and picked

18:52.526 --> 18:57.274
somebody off, then you moved up. but you didn't 
dare buck the line you got where your life was and

18:57.558 --> 19:23.498
I've seen as many as a hundred standing on that 
corner and Haskell and many of those boys would get

18:57.558 --> 19:23.498
out there and hitchhike all day Saturday go as far 
as they could didn't go anywhere particularly and

18:57.558 --> 19:23.498
then turn around Sunday morning or Sunday 
afternoon and start back just to get away Did you

19:24.676 --> 19:31.809
ever, you personally or anybody you ever hear of, 
have any bad Aggie hitchhiking? No, I never heard

19:31.829 --> 19:33.893
of that. Never. And anybody that came along, if 
they had any room, they'd pick them up. But here's

19:40.825 --> 19:42.667
another interesting thing. If somebody came 
along and he's going to go to Calvert or he's going

19:42.808 --> 19:51.799
to go to Hearn, they didn't want to go there because 
there wasn't anybody stopping at Hearn or

19:42.808 --> 19:51.799
Calvert. They wanted to either go to Waco or Fort 
Worth or somewhere. And they didn't have any

19:57.386 --> 20:00.690
compunction about turning it down. They'd just 
say they'd rather not go to Hearn. Now, if you were

20:04.175 --> 20:10.022
in downtown Bryan and wanted to get a ride back to 
College Station, where did you go? I don't

20:10.542 --> 20:13.285
remember where that was, but I know they did that. I 
suppose they'd stand on any corner and somebody

20:13.305 --> 20:20.854
would know if he had a uniform on he was going back to 
campus. Did many students go to and from College

20:21.935 --> 20:26.781
Station on the train? Did they catch the train to go 
home? Oh, to go home? Oh, yeah, I'm sure. Worlds of

20:34.590 --> 20:35.892
them did. In fact, that's the way they'd go to 
Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, the ones that had the

20:37.660 --> 20:43.849
money. Most of them hitchhiked. Where did an 
airplane land in the 30s in this county? Where was

20:52.221 --> 20:54.625
there a runway?

20:59.232 --> 21:00.073
I don't have any idea. Because Easterwood didn't 
exist, and Coulter Field wasn't built yet, was it?

21:04.244 --> 21:04.905
I don't think so. As far as you know, President 
Roosevelt came by train. Oh, yeah. I know he came by

21:09.649 --> 21:13.152
train, because they ran a train ahead of his train. 
I know that. Security. Did you all listen to his

21:18.717 --> 21:22.981
fireside chats, you and your parents and 
everything? Yes. Everybody did. We had a battery

21:26.084 --> 21:29.807
radio out at Wheelock, because it didn't have any 
electricity. Oh, they'd gather around. Did

21:31.833 --> 21:36.101
people feel better after they heard President 
Roosevelt? I think so. He had a settling voice.

21:47.040 --> 21:47.561
Let's see. Who were the famous people then or 
later, who were students when you were here? Who

21:55.561 --> 21:58.705
were some of the students who became famous? Woody 
Varner was one of them. Oh, describe Woody. Woody

22:03.069 --> 22:07.915
was the cadet colonel in my senior year. Oh, make 
believe I didn't know who he was. Tell me about

22:11.018 --> 22:12.119
Woody Varner. Derwood T. Varner from Cottonwood, 
Texas. Yeah. Went on up to, what, Kansas or where?

22:18.486 --> 22:18.947
Nebraska. Nebraska, yeah. Oh, he was, I think he 
was well liked by the students. He was, he was a good

22:25.433 --> 22:30.377
leader as far as I'm concerned, I was, could say 
concerned. But here again, Haskell not being in

22:30.417 --> 22:40.827
the, living in dormitories, I didn't have a lot of 
personal connection with a lot of those, a lot of

22:30.417 --> 22:40.827
those guys. Physically, what size was he? I would 
say he was probably a six foot man, probably would

22:44.210 --> 22:51.516
have weighed 160 or 170 or something like this. 
Good, trim young man. Very, very military

22:54.745 --> 22:58.633
looking. Was a good athlete and a good student. 
Yeah, I know. Let's see. Dick Todd, you overlapped

23:05.208 --> 23:08.174
with him. Oh, I did. Describe him. Scatback, 
that's the best description of him. He could run

23:15.549 --> 23:19.212
through and around more people than you ever did 
see. I saw several football games that he was in. If

23:23.096 --> 23:31.964
he could have been on a team like Kimbrough, or one 
or two of those others later on, he would have been a

23:23.096 --> 23:31.964
phenomenal player. But he was ahead of them. Now 
you overlap with John Kimbrough. Oh, yes.

23:37.309 --> 23:37.969
Describe him. Oh, he was a horse. See I was in school 
his junior year and then through the spring of his

23:42.053 --> 23:54.190
senior year and then I went to his games in the fall 
of his senior year. I was over Texas the day that

23:58.021 --> 24:02.308
they beat us. It was a cold, dreary day, and 
everybody was all uptight about the game, you

24:03.490 --> 24:13.326
know. And this fella Crane. Jack Crane. Jack Crane 
made a touchdown in 60 seconds. Yep. And that was

24:24.691 --> 24:25.972
the ball game. Did you go to it? I was there. I was 
there. I bet Aggies were sick when the game was

24:29.656 --> 24:32.058
over, weren't they? Didn't bother us for the first 
half, you know. Oh, we'll come out of it. But when

24:39.225 --> 24:41.727
that game was over, it was terrible. Lucille had a 
cousin that was in Texas at the time, and we got her

24:43.546 --> 24:54.957
and went to the ball game with her, and we told her, 
she said, if we win today, we're going to go home

24:43.546 --> 24:54.957
with you all. And I said, well, we'd like to have you 
go, but there's not much chance you're going home

24:54.977 --> 24:59.101
with us. I tell you, that trip home wasn't very 
exciting. As far as you know, was Kimbrough a good

25:02.205 --> 25:09.091
student? I don't know. Did the athletes go to class 
then? Sometimes. Were there, as far as you know,

25:13.313 --> 25:18.619
were there any giveaway grades for athletes? I 
expect there were. I don't know anything about

25:19.881 --> 25:21.102
that. But y'all did? Something's oughta 
interesting.

25:27.570 --> 25:31.195
The Blacks, of course, were not very well thought 
of at that time. I remember one, see that team

25:32.176 --> 25:37.803
always went on the train, out of town ball games. 
They went on a game out to California or Utah or

25:38.824 --> 25:42.949
somewhere one time.

25:45.798 --> 25:50.889
And Porter was going to lock the, they stayed on the 
car at night. He was going to lock the car. And some

25:53.535 --> 25:56.100
of them wasn't in and he told them they couldn't get 
in. And they just about ganged him. They had quite a

25:59.467 --> 26:01.371
deal about that. Let's see, Marion Pugh was on 
those teams. He was. Did you know him then? Just

26:06.807 --> 26:08.730
casual. Doggy Pugh, I think he called him. Dookie 
Pugh. Dookie Pugh, okay.

26:17.722 --> 26:20.746
Did you know any of the other Bill Connats, sir? No, 
there was one that I knew a little bit. What was his

26:26.815 --> 26:27.876
name? I can't remember his name. I came in contact 
with one of them several times.

26:37.655 --> 26:42.121
Let's see, now let's talk about international 
events. Do you remember being aware when Germany

26:42.942 --> 26:49.291
invaded Poland in the fall of 1940, 1939? 1939, 
yeah. How did you hear about it, on the radio? Yeah,

26:54.578 --> 27:05.974
and there was an old Czech man that worked for the 
landscape department, name was Brin, and he had

26:54.578 --> 27:05.974
come from Czechoslovakia. And he kept up with it, 
and of course he kept all of us informed about what

27:06.747 --> 27:18.466
was happening and why it was all so bad and all that, 
but people were beginning to worry about it. It was

27:19.528 --> 27:22.072
quite the talk about that time. Did you and your 
buddies begin to think that the United States

27:22.613 --> 27:29.424
would ever be involved in that war? Not when I 
graduated, I guess. See I graduated in June of 40

27:33.747 --> 27:48.610
and of course Japan was already invading a lot of 
the southeastern countries over there so they

27:33.747 --> 27:48.610
were already on the move. Germany was on the move 
and I got I got called active duty in February of 41 I

27:58.351 --> 28:05.201
remember that's a year before Pearl Harbor, 
because I had a commission, got out with the

27:58.351 --> 28:05.201
commission, and I got called there. Roosevelt was 
beginning to build up the force as he saw it coming,

28:05.781 --> 28:16.897
and I got called to duty, so I was on duty a year 
before Pearl Harbor. Back to some A&M traditions.

28:22.044 --> 28:24.387
How much did, who paid for your senior ring? How 
much did it cost? Twenty-five dollars.

28:27.657 --> 28:28.539
Twenty-five dollars. Twenty-five. Have you ever 
lost it? Yes. Where'd you? I didn't tell you my

28:32.106 --> 28:33.449
story about it? No. Oh, I'd love to have a ring 
story. Oh, listen. I was getting ready to go

28:37.176 --> 28:38.639
overseas. It was over in Mississippi. I had an 
engineer maintenance company that I was

28:41.064 --> 28:44.010
commanded. We were loading our equipment on the 
train. It rained all day. I was up and down the train

28:49.516 --> 28:53.686
supervising the tying down, loading equipment. 
It was gravel. It wasn't any asphalt. And I was

28:57.476 --> 29:00.543
walking along and I saw a ring on the ground. And I 
reached down and picked it up. A&M ring. I looked

29:05.665 --> 29:10.171
inside and it said Joe Hanover and I didn't know I'd 
lost it. I think what I'm sure all day with my hand

29:11.173 --> 29:25.152
down my fingers swell and I expect I put it on my 
little finger is what I replay and it probably

29:11.173 --> 29:25.152
slipped off but I didn't even know I'd lost it. And

29:25.172 --> 29:34.525
have you, do you have any ring stories about being 
somewhere far far away and somebody noticing it?

29:36.608 --> 29:37.389
Everywhere you go. Everywhere. That ring is 
identified... I went to London back in March a year

29:45.061 --> 29:49.228
ago. I ran into a few people over there that said 
something about my A&M ring. Of course, after the

29:57.020 --> 29:58.622
war, I was in Europe nearly a year after the war was 
over, and of course I went to Paris and I went to

29:59.210 --> 30:16.588
Switzerland and Luxembourg and all around the 
country, and even some of those people over there

29:59.210 --> 30:16.588
recognized A&M rings. Senior boots. Did you have 
senior boots? Mm-hmm. Where'd you get them? Still

30:21.053 --> 30:21.713
got them. Where'd you get them? In Hollick? 
Hollick. How much? $35. Lucille gave me those

30:27.448 --> 30:30.051
boots. She was working. How did you feel when you 
first put on those boots? Oh, that was great. And

30:37.721 --> 30:45.670
let me tell you what, people that bought boots from 
Hollick, he kept them shined all year, free of

30:37.721 --> 30:45.670
charge. Now, and I've never asked anybody this, 
did you meet Mr. Hollick? I met a Mr. Hollick. One of

30:54.419 --> 30:55.821
them. Describe the one you met. Well, he was a 
typical old fellow that looked like he'd worked

30:58.165 --> 31:06.338
hard all his life.

31:09.082 --> 31:10.123
Wanted to talk, you know. We've got a lot of stories 
to tell you. Just wanted to be your friend.
