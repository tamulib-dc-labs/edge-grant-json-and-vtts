WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:06.650
the same time there's more research and so the aim 
is switch that way. Yes I think I think a lot of our

00:06.670 --> 00:31.776
students are prepared more particularly since 
they put in more math and you have a stronger

00:06.670 --> 00:31.776
pre-vet requirements and that calculus and I 
think I've had several graduate courses calculus

00:06.670 --> 00:31.776
I just learned to make a summation sign and wrote in 
memory as far as I was concerned. I checked out a

00:37.310 --> 00:43.838
book, Calculus Made Easy, but it didn't look too 
easy. I always liked math, but that's one reason I

00:43.858 --> 00:53.650
advise some of the top students to take math. Well, 
there's one in Florida now and has a PhD and he's

00:53.670 --> 01:01.780
doing research work in toxicology when he was a 
senior. R.A. Junior, I advised him to take

01:03.364 --> 01:08.029
calculus, and he took, made two A's. And in the two, 
I think it was 201, 202 then, made A's in both

01:09.731 --> 01:19.221
semesters of calculus. He loved that math. But now 
it's a requirement. As far as the students are

01:26.930 --> 01:30.754
concerned, Back when you started vet school, 
there were just a handful of students that

01:31.072 --> 01:36.097
applied. Now there's 600 a year that are applying 
to try to get into A&M vet school. How can you count

01:41.402 --> 01:45.246
for this tremendous increase in applications? 
Why is there so much interest?

01:49.870 --> 01:50.471
I don't know. One thing amazed me, why the interest 
in the women? I never would have thought that women

01:55.236 --> 01:59.880
would have become so interested in it. Some of them 
were quite successful. Well, that leads to

02:02.759 --> 02:04.321
another thing. In 1963, the very first woman was 
admitted to the vet school. She was a good one, too.

02:11.113 --> 02:12.655
Yeah. Now, one-third of the student body over 
there is women. A lot of faculty members are women.

02:18.064 --> 02:21.069
Let's talk about the women in the vet school. How 
did this come about? Why did they admit her?

02:29.932 --> 02:36.381
I don't know exactly why they admitted them, 
because they had applications.

02:38.163 --> 02:50.881
Dean French came here from, I think he was in the 
chemistry department at

02:38.163 --> 02:50.881
VPI, Virginia Polytechnic. And he was the dean of 
the graduate school here, and recommended, oh, we

02:56.645 --> 03:04.272
had some splendid students from Virginia who came 
here in veterinary medicine. And when he got his

03:04.292 --> 03:14.822
influence, when he had been here for several 
years, we could see that the quality dropped

03:04.292 --> 03:14.822
because he screened them. And I'd say of all the 
Virginia students we had, I had only one mediocre

03:14.842 --> 03:23.770
to poor student. He had a hard time getting a C. But 
after that, well, we didn't have any more Virginia

03:26.547 --> 03:30.271
students. And

03:30.471 --> 03:42.665
I think Dean French's attitude, he left here and 
went to Washington State and straightened out

03:30.471 --> 03:42.665
that institution. I don't know. He's probably 
retired now. But

03:45.768 --> 03:50.674
he, I think, helped us. He criticized us.

03:56.399 --> 04:01.906
of not looking on ourselves as a graduate school, a 
professional school. And he even thought that

04:03.268 --> 04:16.604
perhaps we should have, be governed by a different 
formula for evaluation for appropriations. And I

04:18.026 --> 04:21.270
think he helped our morale a lot. And not the dean, 
probably the dean, got him to talk to us for that

04:25.745 --> 04:27.647
reason. I don't recall which dean it was at the 
time. I

04:31.852 --> 04:41.404
think the student is much better qualified now and 
to go into more things. And I think that's one

04:41.684 --> 04:46.770
reason that these better students are screened to 
get in. Some of them have master's degrees. Some of

04:49.353 --> 04:51.015
them have PhD degrees. Well, what about the women, 
though? Well, there are more openings for

04:54.010 --> 05:03.286
veterinary medicine now, particularly, say, in 
the case of medical school. You usually have

05:03.326 --> 05:18.313
somebody who has to take care of the animal colony, 
and frequently they'll have a veterinarian on the

05:03.326 --> 05:18.313
staff at the medical school.

05:18.935 --> 05:27.524
who used to be in pathology, and I think he was an 
Oklahoma product, but he went from here to the

05:18.935 --> 05:27.524
Philippines, I think, then came back. He's

05:27.585 --> 05:39.197
on the staff of the medical school in San Antonio 
University, Texas Medical School, but he's a

05:27.585 --> 05:39.197
veterinarian.

05:41.620 --> 05:46.225
But we've had some capable women, too, and they 
have gotten into The man has more opportunities, I

05:46.677 --> 05:53.164
think, in so far as going to things. When women 
came, when women started back in 63, did you notice

05:53.665 --> 06:07.360
any, was there any resistance not to let women in, 
or was there any problems with the women? Do you

06:07.420 --> 06:10.943
remember anything like that? Or were they 
generally accepted right away? I would like to

06:12.986 --> 06:16.009
think that there were isolated cases. I know when 
Sonia came in in 63. What was her last name?

06:24.083 --> 06:38.281
Oliphant, O-L-I-P-H-A-N-T. She was from a small 
town between San Antonio and the border, or

06:24.083 --> 06:38.281
between San Antonio and Edinburgh, somewhere in 
there.

06:38.822 --> 06:46.131
But she was interested in large animals, horses, 
and I remember one truck came in with some a cow and a

06:46.465 --> 06:47.827
calf. And there's some great big old boys in that 
class, and Sonia's a small person, I guess, I don't

06:50.111 --> 07:12.405
know, Sonia was about five, five, something like 
this, and weighed about 145 or 150, and she went in

06:50.111 --> 07:12.405
there and picked that calf out, put him in her arms, 
and knew what to do with it. And there was an old boy

07:13.313 --> 07:18.400
standing around, you know, and she just went in 
there. I had never heard of any adverse criticism

07:19.642 --> 07:25.992
of that girl because she was good all around.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.513
Some of the girls that I had were rather mediocre. 
Sonya was good. And then I happened to hit two or

07:42.473 --> 07:48.766
three mediocre ones, and I'd find a real good one. 
What do you think their overall quality was

07:48.786 --> 07:51.531
compared to the men? Oh, it's much better now than 
back in those days. But I mean, generally, are they

07:56.181 --> 08:02.153
about the same quality as the male students back in 
the mid-'60s?

08:06.925 --> 08:19.518
I'd say this insofar as the last class I taught in 
67,

08:06.925 --> 08:19.518
I think I had three or five, I don't recall. I would 
say offhand that the average male was better than

08:20.639 --> 08:33.152
the average

08:20.639 --> 08:33.152
woman. I wouldn't say they weren't misfits, but 
those girls

08:34.465 --> 08:43.898
had a pretty hard time, some of them. And some of the 
students that perhaps didn't like them and made

08:43.918 --> 08:49.546
life pretty miserable. But they had to get it the 
hard way. I think that would be true almost

08:54.273 --> 08:58.099
anything. And probably other classes too on the 
campus. I recall

09:03.288 --> 09:09.095
when Mr. Rudder was in Washington, when they 
decided to take in one summer school, to open it up

09:09.155 --> 09:17.205
to the female. I guess that was probably in, when 
did they open up to the entire school? I was within

09:27.678 --> 09:30.882
63, but they didn't allow women in general. That 
was at a veterinary school. In the mid-60s, yeah.

09:35.892 --> 09:42.599
Yeah, but when they did, Mr. Rutter was in 
Washington on business for the college, the

09:35.892 --> 09:42.599
university then. And he complimented the, when he 
came back, he complimented the academic council

09:44.701 --> 09:57.935
on the way we handled taking in the women. And... 
The battalion was filled with editorials and with

10:01.777 --> 10:12.853
letters from students objecting to the girls. Oh, 
my, they were fighting them. They just didn't want

10:16.078 --> 10:19.323
to. My oldest son, who's with the university now in 
executive development, when he heard it from me,

10:30.920 --> 10:36.706
about

10:30.920 --> 10:36.706
the way we voted in academic council. President 
Morgan had finished all the agenda for the day. And

10:45.535 --> 10:49.639
someone, he says, anything else? And someone 
said, how in order to protect women? He said, well,

10:53.583 --> 10:58.248
he says, let's take a straw vote. I said, I'd just 
like to. I think there were 54 or 56 of us. Every one

11:02.845 --> 11:05.148
of us held up a hand. And I was home, and my oldest son 
told me, he said, how in the world could you vote for

11:06.230 --> 11:17.726
something like that? Because he was an old laggy. 
And that was, he was out through school. He

11:24.134 --> 11:25.336
finished in 52. He said, how in the world? He was in 
the Air Force. He says, how could you vote for

11:30.640 --> 11:35.685
something like that? He says, what in the world 
will A&M come to? And he had two classes, taught two

11:39.910 --> 11:45.836
classes, and had a bunch of girls in each one. He 
didn't pay any attention to it now. He just became a

11:48.378 --> 11:50.360
part of it. But I think that's one of the best things 
that college ever did, was make it co-ed. Sure. In

11:59.952 --> 12:10.824
the vet school, what impact, in your opinion, was 
there an impact or were there any changes because

11:59.952 --> 12:10.824
they let women into the vet school? Not that I know 
of. Not that I know of. I just knew of cases where

12:15.810 --> 12:24.680
they'd tell me that particular girls were having a 
pretty rough time with some of the students. And

12:24.700 --> 12:29.385
most of the girls that they were talking about, 
they were mediocre students. They weren't

12:29.787 --> 12:31.950
superiors to them. But I never heard of one adverse 
criticism of Sonia. She was a lady, a young lady,

12:36.255 --> 12:48.910
and she

12:36.255 --> 12:48.910
caused no trouble whatsoever that I ever knew of. 
She was more interested in large animals, the boy

12:49.351 --> 12:52.174
she married. He was about two, wasn't he? But he was 
a grade later. And she worked for the microbiology

12:58.293 --> 13:09.503
department for a year after she got her degree, 
until he got his degree. He was interested in small

13:09.523 --> 13:12.646
animals, and she was interested in large animals. 
But that's the way they were brought up. Now, I have

13:18.391 --> 13:21.394
about two more final questions. And one deals with 
why? Can you tell me the story behind why you wrote

13:25.373 --> 13:29.318
the history? Well, I wouldn't say it was pressure. 
I had a chance to turn it down. I did it first.

13:39.191 --> 13:45.819
But I had just recently read Dr. Williams' history 
of Harry Long. Oh, T. Harry Williams, yeah. Yeah,

13:49.504 --> 13:50.185
of LSU. And that's an excellent book. That 
certainly is, isn't it? And I got interested in how

13:55.327 --> 14:00.654
he had that documented. He did a lot of oral 
histories. T. Harry Williams did a lot of oral

14:03.457 --> 14:06.421
histories. He did. But I talked to the head of the 
department over here and he said, oh yes, he's a

14:08.183 --> 14:15.071
visiting lecturer. He said he's an outstanding 
historian.

14:20.707 --> 14:26.114
Yeah, unfortunately he died just recently, a few 
months ago, during the last year. But

14:27.536 --> 14:50.005
I got interested in that and the way it was handled 
and

14:27.536 --> 14:50.005
when it was at McMurray's farewell party, I don't 
recall that year, exact year, but We were in the

14:52.060 --> 15:03.190
veterinary library,

14:52.060 --> 15:03.190
and Dean

14:52.060 --> 15:03.190
Shelton walked up to me. I always called him 
George. I had him as a student. And we got to

15:07.393 --> 15:11.977
talking, and then Wally Bay walked up. And George 
says, we're interested in getting somebody to

15:14.319 --> 15:21.325
write a history of veterinary medicine. said, 
what, do you have any recommendation? I said, yes.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.181
Al Price is a man you want. And they laughed, both of 
them laughed, and I knew they were in cahoots. So,

15:38.652 --> 15:43.160
they said, no, we want you to do it. And I said, why 
not Al? He said, well, He's been on top of it, and

15:49.790 --> 15:54.115
he's afraid he couldn't treat it objectively. I 
said, let me think about it.

16:00.263 --> 16:08.452
And so I don't know whether I called him the next day 
or the second day or third day, and I finally told

16:00.263 --> 16:08.452
him I'd take it. But I was happy that I did, because I 
got to visit with Well, I visited every

16:17.920 --> 16:24.666
department, and Maurer helped me on the research 
part. There were a lot of people that had to say so.

16:29.610 --> 16:32.933
In fact, all of them read it, passed around, read 
it. And they improved it. Because I didn't touch

16:38.377 --> 16:46.744
all the bases, and

16:38.377 --> 16:46.744
I remember Al Price. I didn't take it to Al. I wish I 
had. Because he looked at it, after it was all

16:50.694 --> 16:58.502
finished, he says, very good, but see, you didn't 
put everything in. I said, goodness alive, who

16:58.662 --> 17:00.263
could? I said, if there's anything left out, why in 
the world did you leave it out of your annual

17:00.283 --> 17:07.710
reports? I said, I think I've touched pretty well 
all the bases in the annual reports. But

17:13.356 --> 17:18.100
I had It was passed back to me and said I had too much 
on the extension. And he says, try to condense

17:25.009 --> 17:27.591
that. And I said, well, about a half or a third. I 
condensed it down to one third and saved some

17:32.016 --> 17:38.143
space.

17:41.066 --> 17:43.749
But I enjoyed doing it. And then one thing that I 
decided After I found out there were so many PhDs

17:48.286 --> 17:59.100
and so many masters in there,

17:48.286 --> 17:59.100
Dean Shelton's request was that he'd like a list of 
all the PhDs. I said, well, why not the masters? He

18:01.884 --> 18:05.329
says, well, he says, if you ought to do it. So then 
Doug goes up. And the main thing, before I got

18:09.855 --> 18:17.044
through, I don't know whether I thought I had 
spoken out of turn. Because one individual was

18:18.998 --> 18:27.167
listed in three, having received a master's 
degree in three departments.

18:30.391 --> 18:31.051
They cleaned him. And I knew what department had 
him. And it turned out that physiology. I knew he

18:39.341 --> 18:40.862
had taken physiology. But two other departments 
had him. So I finally went to him and asked him. And

18:48.530 --> 18:50.873
he told me what it was in. And what happened was that 
the secretaries, I asked each head of the

18:52.436 --> 19:08.378
department, they went through and these theses, 
dissertations, were all filed in that. And they

19:08.438 --> 19:11.623
could have several copies made. And so these other 
two departments had a copy of that thesis. And

19:16.330 --> 19:17.912
that's the way it happened. But I had to watch that, 
and I thought,

19:19.057 --> 19:28.910
I was afraid that I'd leave somebody out. So I went 
to the graduate office and went through that file

19:29.771 --> 19:37.702
to see, get a check, but I didn't pick up any. But

19:37.722 --> 19:44.170
I said, if I make one of commission, It wouldn't be 
so bad, but I said, if I only met one person, I'm

19:45.922 --> 19:51.109
going to catch it. And I should. But

19:57.358 --> 20:05.990
one of the first ones I handed, handed one of these 
out. He says, I found an arrow. And I said, what's

20:11.167 --> 20:14.732
the problem more? He said, I don't have a 
bachelor's degree. I said, doggone it, you better

20:17.556 --> 20:20.601
be listed in there somewhere. I said, that's 
either in one of the catalogs, the A&M Journal

20:20.781 --> 20:27.430
catalog. I said, that's not of my thinking. In 
fact, he's in the physiology department right

20:30.254 --> 20:32.718
now. But he said, he got his

20:33.719 --> 20:39.047
DVM. a master's and his PhD at Iowa State. And never 
had a bachelor's degree. And no bachelor's. And so

20:48.016 --> 20:50.460
he said, I don't know. I said, well, suppose you did 
have one and you had left it out. I said, that's what

20:55.988 --> 20:57.190
had hurt me. I said, well, it didn't hurt me having 
that thing on me. And I said, I didn't put anybody's

21:00.955 --> 21:09.287
degree in there unless I found it listed 
somewhere, even in the general catalog. are in the

21:10.297 --> 21:11.438
departments. And I said, I've checked and 
double-checked that. And I said, to me, that's a

21:17.945 --> 21:21.609
minor part. And he laughed about it.

21:26.934 --> 21:32.440
I have one final question, and that concerns your 
career at A&M. How would you analyze or how would

21:33.481 --> 21:39.207
you summarize your career at A&M?

21:42.511 --> 21:43.852
A happy experience. A happy experience.

21:50.759 --> 21:54.342
If I had to do it over again, I'd probably make the 
same mistakes. I'd hope that I wouldn't, but...

21:57.324 --> 21:59.987
Were there some major mistakes that you thought 
that you made? Not that I know of, but... How about

22:00.047 --> 22:03.550
accomplishments? Well, I know I came to the 
crossroads of, in the...

22:13.645 --> 22:23.296
Oh, in the thirties, I think, as to whether I would 
concentrate and get all this work together. The

22:24.237 --> 22:27.581
early thirties, in fact, is when it happened. And 
get a Ph.D. or go on and take these specialized

22:27.601 --> 22:31.746
courses. I did one course in the top physiologists 
of the country, and that was in his department.

22:40.207 --> 22:40.607
A.J. Carlson's Department of Physiology at the 
University of Chicago, and I wanted some work on

22:40.647 --> 22:53.280
one of the top physiological chemistry 
departments, and that was at the University of

22:40.647 --> 22:53.280
Chicago. And the Kochs, Dr. and Mrs. Koch, both 
were in the department. They were both in Europe

22:57.485 --> 23:09.657
that summer, but I got the work on Gustafson, who 
later was chancellor at Nebraska, and then later

22:57.485 --> 23:09.657
was went with the Ford Company, Ford Foundation, 
and was considered as the president when Tom

23:10.531 --> 23:18.602
Harrington was made president here. And his name 
is, I said, is that R.A.G. of Colorado and

23:23.089 --> 23:27.335
University of Chicago fans? He said, yes. And I 
said, he's the top man. I said, that's the best

23:32.442 --> 23:36.808
teacher, one of the best teachers I've ever had. I 
said, he made chemistry look very easy to me. And I

23:41.345 --> 23:56.227
said, I didn't tell them, but one of the best exams I 
ever stood, I think, was on that course under him,

23:41.345 --> 23:56.227
because he was par excellence as an instructor. 
But they say he was too old. I happened to be on the

23:58.570 --> 24:05.941
committee, the president's committee, for the 
selection of the president. And I think he was 54 at

24:05.961 --> 24:10.828
the time we met him. I think there was one 
representative from each one of the schools, and

24:13.660 --> 24:35.955
Gib Giltrus was chancellor, and Fred Jensen was 
chemistry, and I don't recall, Godbey was in

24:13.660 --> 24:35.955
agriculture, I don't recall the others.

24:39.952 --> 24:41.875
So you took these short courses then? Yes, and as 
some of them said, I know

24:42.255 --> 25:06.988
there was an endocrinologist here, not an 
endocrinologist, but, I

24:42.255 --> 25:06.988
can't dispel now, but he said, you're making a 
mistake, says, you're going, what if you get fired

25:07.930 --> 25:12.795
one of these days? I said, well, I'll go back to my 
first love and this practice. And I says, I'm not

25:18.601 --> 25:20.623
worried about that. He says, if I'm not good enough 
for the teacher here, why? I don't care. So I said, I

25:25.107 --> 25:29.732
think at the time, I'd be doing that. But if I had to 
go over again, I might. As things have developed, I

25:33.516 --> 25:36.739
might concentrate and and work on a PhD. But at the 
time I thought I did the best, better of the two

25:41.907 --> 25:52.137
because I wasn't degree-minded at the time. And 
you think it was the best choice for you in the long

25:53.158 --> 25:56.301
run? Yes. I wouldn't take anything for that 
experience with Dr. Pymal. Did you ever think

26:02.588 --> 26:04.250
about leaving A&M? Did you ever think of another 
alternative, another university?

26:10.199 --> 26:19.688
No, when I retired in 67, I had a chance of going to 
Iowa State for a year, but that was because their

26:10.199 --> 26:19.688
man in Farmer College came here. I had nothing to do 
with thinking this, because I was a very good

26:19.709 --> 26:30.419
friend of the head of the department up there, and 
by his own choice, he had written down here

26:19.709 --> 26:30.419
something. He wanted to come to Texas for some 
reason, and so we ended up having their

26:41.418 --> 26:43.001
pharmacology instructor.

26:48.049 --> 26:51.494
So I was going to fill in for a year and I turned it 
down. I said no, I'd rather not. So I was ready for a

26:55.420 --> 26:59.106
rest.

27:03.954 --> 27:06.598
Well thanks, thank you very much for this 
interview. Is there anything that you think we

27:07.507 --> 27:11.198
should talk about that I missed? No, I think 
perhaps I've mentioned some things I shouldn't.

27:15.811 --> 27:17.416
Then you can edit them out. Thank you very much.
