00:01.685 --> 00:16.526
Because had this revolution not been, and had it 
not taken place, I imagine today I'd probably be in

00:01.685 --> 00:16.526
Mexico.

00:21.032 --> 00:24.537
And we all would have missed an opportunity.

00:31.300 --> 00:37.430
Now, if you had stayed in Mexico and there had been 
no revolution, presumably you would have been

00:31.300 --> 00:37.430
part of the upper class. Probably. But there was a 
revolution, and there has been and were

00:40.334 --> 00:47.686
revolutions since then. Anyway, we don't know 
what destiny would have had in store for us over

00:50.110 --> 00:57.662
there, but we are fortunate. the revolution took 
place, and we left Mexico. And we're most

01:03.484 --> 01:07.671
grateful.

01:07.831 --> 01:12.058
Neither you nor your parents have ever given any 
thought of going back to Mexico? No. We're most

01:14.802 --> 01:18.508
grateful for the blessings that we received. Have 
you ever been back just to visit? Oh, yes. You've

01:25.013 --> 01:26.975
been back to your old hometown? I went once to the 
hometown. I was there for a very short while. I saw

01:35.466 --> 01:45.718
places that brought back memories of my infancy.

01:48.822 --> 01:52.506
And, of course, the place has changed 
considerably. And it was just out of curiosity

01:53.954 --> 01:58.261
that I went back to this particular place.

02:04.432 --> 02:06.956
Was the family home still there? The family home 
had been confiscated by the government for, I

02:06.977 --> 02:16.453
guess, an unpayment of taxes. We had several... 
plantations that belonged or would have belonged

02:20.212 --> 02:35.839
to my mother by descent and distribution that 
nobody ever cared to make a claim for.

02:35.859 --> 02:43.873
We were too happy in the

02:35.859 --> 02:43.873
United States.

02:48.713 --> 02:57.965
The country around here, around El Paso, is it very 
different in physical appearance from the part of

02:48.713 --> 02:57.965
Chihuahua you were from, or is it similar? 
Similar. In Santa Barbara, the mining town was dry

02:58.686 --> 03:07.078
and arid. El Paso has similar mountains, similar 
climate. However, El Valle is an oasis. a lot of

03:18.734 --> 03:19.856
vegetation.

03:22.799 --> 03:42.466
This country that we passed over was mostly 
farmlands, farms and ranches scattered from El

03:22.799 --> 03:42.466
Valle and Peral, north to Delicias.

03:45.931 --> 03:47.593
Now coming through Nica was quite an arid 
experience, an arid portion of the country.

03:56.722 --> 04:01.269
But

03:56.722 --> 04:01.269
we don't see it that way. We just

04:01.370 --> 04:13.429
looked forward in making an exodus out of a 
turmoiled country. How did your family happen to

04:14.000 --> 04:18.365
come to Chihuahua, that is your ancestors, in the 
beginning?

04:22.109 --> 04:22.969
I don't know. They say that one of my ancestors had 
been a general in the army, the Porfirio Diaz

04:23.010 --> 04:31.959
regime. But that's hearsay. Now, from my mother's 
side, they were all farmers from in the area around

04:42.637 --> 04:45.661
El Valle in Peral.

04:48.865 --> 04:53.751
And they had come into the area, do you remember in 
what years they came into the area? I have no idea.

04:55.292 --> 04:57.415
But they must have come in there as pioneers. 
Pioneers, they must have. At one time. Right. From

05:00.138 --> 05:02.581
the south. Or,

05:02.601 --> 05:07.968
we have no idea. We used to hear about our 
grandfather on the paternal side being the

05:11.003 --> 05:16.889
general in the Diaz army. We don't know, I don't 
know whether that was braggadocious or not.

05:29.201 --> 05:40.993
However, my experience since I was able to cope 
with reasoning power

05:41.868 --> 05:54.083
I don't remember of any incident

05:41.868 --> 05:54.083
that was not related to, like I said, when my father 
left. He left us in Santa Barbara. It was terrible.

05:59.110 --> 06:03.055
That must have been right in 1910 or 1911 when he 
first left? Sometime around that age. How did he

06:04.957 --> 06:08.702
hear that he had to get out of town? Oh. Everybody 
knew as soon as the revolution started breaking

06:10.454 --> 06:17.986
here, there, and built pots of resistance here. 
Everybody knew that a científico was the arced

06:19.709 --> 06:30.866
enemy of the revolutionary element. And it was a 
class struggle and a vicious one.

06:39.530 --> 06:49.462
The proletariat had venom and vindictiveness and 
wrath upon this class of people. So that's why

06:51.205 --> 06:52.766
Father left. He left this small mining town in 
Santa Barbara. I think he had been Presidente

06:59.335 --> 07:06.904
Municipal there, or had been affluent with the 
government. And he knew that if he stayed there, he

07:08.403 --> 07:17.679
would be one of the first individuals that 
reprisals would be taken against him. And that's

07:20.244 --> 07:22.127
why he left as far as Canada. Get a whole country 
between. That's right. Did anyone ever really

07:26.896 --> 07:30.362
bother your mother and the small children? Oh, 
yes. They used to be the proletariats that would

07:32.045 --> 07:47.144
come around the household and would sing dirty and 
nasty songs about the revolution and about people

07:32.045 --> 07:47.144
in Mexico that were scared to death. And they would 
sing.

07:50.949 --> 07:55.395
We had neighbors that would come in and sing these 
songs. And they said, now that the revolution is

07:55.535 --> 08:01.242
here, now you are going to get it. and songs of 
threats and of intimidation.

08:11.274 --> 08:14.678
And we were constantly in fear. Every time a band of 
different rebels would come into the city, like I

08:15.359 --> 08:25.390
told you, they would use that tank as a target. 
Several times after the battles were over, we

08:26.028 --> 08:49.986
could hear a knock or expect a knock at the door of 
the house and open the door and a bunch of soldiers

08:26.028 --> 08:49.986
and horses, horseback, very unusual looking 
characters with their guns and cartuchetas all

08:26.028 --> 08:49.986
over them and the officer knocking down at the 
door. They would say, all right, boys, come on in.

08:55.222 --> 09:19.963
some troops would go in there bayonets guns look 
for the enemy and we the officer would on numerous

08:55.222 --> 09:19.963
occasions said we heard that you were shooting at 
us from this area

08:55.222 --> 09:19.963
right sometimes mother and the children would be 
out on the sidewalk and in the evening conversing

09:20.838 --> 09:25.724
All of a sudden, we'd hear turmoil coming down the 
street, a mob of people hollering. And we would

09:26.345 --> 09:29.208
holler and say, the Madaristas are coming. And we 
would all go in doors, lock ourselves.

09:35.777 --> 09:38.580
We had a great big door for this one. And one night, 
Mother was visiting with ladies on the street, on

09:39.722 --> 09:48.853
the sidewalk there, sitting down, taking air. 
When we heard this commotion coming down the

09:49.593 --> 09:55.419
street and we rushed in, I locked the door. I got my 
thumb cut in between me. That's why we had one thumb

09:58.843 --> 10:01.446
larger than the other. Oh, my goodness. It was 
smashed. And, of course, little incidents. But we

10:10.296 --> 10:13.319
could expect that a daily occurrence. We wanted to 
get out of there. Did you hear from your father by

10:16.913 --> 10:20.858
mail or any other way during this period? No way. 
One night, or in the early hours of the morning,

10:21.199 --> 10:28.709
here he comes with his big, big wee child.

10:31.593 --> 10:32.494
All right, get ready. We're leaving in the 
morning. And that was the first time in nearly two

10:34.998 --> 10:40.505
years your mother had even known he was alive, for 
sure, I guess. I guess so. That's the first night I

10:40.846 --> 10:44.170
was able to recognize my father. That's the first 
mental impression. So it must have been a year or

10:46.358 --> 10:57.292
two that I was growing up and had no conception of 
what my father looked like until that night that I

10:46.358 --> 10:57.292
saw him. I knew he was my father because mother told 
me. And of course, the affections.

11:07.384 --> 11:08.325
The rest of the kids. I said, oh, they had this great 
big hat. disguised as a proletariat. No time to

11:16.135 --> 11:16.496
lose. He must have been a very brave man to come back 
in. Right. For all of you that way. I don't know how

11:23.122 --> 11:30.929
he got there, but he had this wagon, a team of mules, 
and off he took.

11:34.353 --> 11:36.255
Going through the back roads.

11:39.257 --> 11:42.000
Yes, it was a very interesting experience. Well, 
when you got to the States, did any of you speak

11:44.022 --> 11:46.645
English? I was the guest speaker at the White 
House. LBJ took a liking to me, I don't know why, and

11:54.014 --> 12:01.003
he would invite me to the White House to be the guest 
speaker. And he named me on several committees for

12:03.366 --> 12:13.658
the purpose of creating and organizing and 
building a new society. And I spoke at the White

12:14.144 --> 12:29.441
House one night about a little incident that took 
place here in El Paso with me while I was going to

12:14.144 --> 12:29.441
school. I went to Alamo School. After I became of 
age, I wasn't old enough to go to school. I think I

12:37.590 --> 12:41.434
had to wait some two years, maybe a year, I don't 
know. Anyway, I went to Alamo

12:41.853 --> 12:54.172
school, and the lady there, the teacher, Ms. Witt, 
taught us children how to raise our little two

12:41.853 --> 12:54.172
fingers. Anytime we wanted to go to the restroom 
and use these magical words, may I be excused. So

13:02.745 --> 13:04.888
she was a bilingualist. She told us what it meant.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.189
One day Mrs. Whip becomes ill, and they have a 
substitute, a beautiful blonde girl with blue

13:13.850 --> 13:23.262
eyes. Oh, she was beautiful. And in due time, I 
raised my little fingers. Teacher, my biscus. She

13:32.493 --> 13:35.637
turned around and says, if it's absolutely 
necessary. Well, not being a bilingualist, I did

13:37.203 --> 13:45.694
not know what if it's absolutely necessary meant. 
So I took it and presumed that my permission had

13:45.714 --> 13:49.359
been denied. So five minutes later, I raised my two 
little fingers again and said, teacher, may I have

13:51.122 --> 13:56.649
an excuse? And I got the same answer, if it's 
absolutely necessary. I sat down. And about five

14:03.916 --> 14:09.986
minutes later, I raised my fingers again and asked 
for the excuse. And she again said, if it's

14:10.066 --> 14:12.751
absolutely necessary. Well, ladies and 
gentlemen, by that time, it had become apparent

14:13.772 --> 14:20.443
that it had been necessary. Since thereafter, the 
kids in school changed my nickname from Kiko to

14:27.794 --> 14:33.509
something else which was very embarrassing. But 
the reason I'm relating that, this is what I was

14:33.529 --> 14:38.563
telling it, is because We did not possess the 
ability of understanding. And we needed at that

14:44.104 --> 15:00.108
time, as it's needed now, a course or something 
that would teach the children going for the first

14:44.104 --> 15:00.108
time to an American English-speaking school at 
least the rudiments of the English language.

15:03.413 --> 15:05.156
It would be very obvious. It was quite obvious. 
Now, do you remember when it was that you really

15:07.248 --> 15:12.155
began to learn English? How many years of school 
did it take? Well, the first, probably six months

15:16.421 --> 15:28.677
after I went to school, I started learning 
English. Not only in school, but by singing these

15:29.779 --> 15:35.787
little songs that the children get in the first 
grade. And learning, how do you do, Will? How do you

15:38.958 --> 15:40.080
do, Fly? This is Will. This is Fly. This is Mel. We 
learned all flat in first grade, but probably six

15:45.207 --> 15:53.218
or seven months after you're in school. But I 
learned English a little faster than those

15:53.819 --> 15:58.125
children. Not because I heard it at home. but 
because I heard it downtown, selling papers and

16:02.075 --> 16:15.575
shining shoes and learning that the mystery word 
for sir or senor was mister. And mister shine,

16:15.595 --> 16:26.732
mister paper, mister this, and gradually you 
start building a vocabulary of what you hear from

16:15.595 --> 16:26.732
other people. So it was beyond the school 
experience then. In working, you needed the

16:32.837 --> 16:34.659
language. And that provided an extra. It was both 
in school, but mostly the most effective teacher

16:36.341 --> 16:47.216
that I had was in the streets selling newspaper. 
Paper, mister? Paper, mister? He would say, no,

16:51.682 --> 16:53.024
thank you. No. Well, no and no is the same. And 
gradually, you start building a vocabulary, a

16:56.598 --> 17:05.210
street vocabulary.

17:05.230 --> 17:08.214
Tramp, that was about the second word I learned. 
And of course, you marvel with amazement why I

17:10.017 --> 17:14.343
should learn the word tramp. Well, the fellow who 
would give us his newspapers. Somehow or other,

17:19.129 --> 17:24.597
the rest of the kids, instead of calling the 
circulation manager, or the distributor, he

17:24.982 --> 17:28.086
would count out the papers. And he says, here. And 
they called that man who would give the papers out

17:30.488 --> 17:33.712
Tramp. Because as I later found out, that the 
Tramps coming in and out, trenching people of the

17:35.374 --> 17:46.486
cities, would get jobs also selling papers. But 
they were older than we were. Consequently, they

17:48.709 --> 17:51.512
would be the distributors. And they would, people 
would call them tramps because they had floated

17:51.813 --> 17:58.621
into the city of El Paso. I guess that's why. Well, 
when you were arrested, you spoke pretty good

17:59.862 --> 18:06.309
English by that time, didn't you? By that time, 
yes. I was about 12 years old, and I was going to

18:08.632 --> 18:12.637
Bailey, Bailey School. That's right. I started in 
Bailey School in the fifth grade. And as you

18:16.721 --> 18:19.204
remember, First, we lived at 1011 East 3rd, and 
we're going to Alamo School, clearly a school

18:19.471 --> 18:37.615
wherein no English was utterly spoken until, 
uttered or spoken in until you got to the second and

18:19.471 --> 18:37.615
third, fourth grade. So your first year in school 
was taught in Spanish? No, in English, but the

18:40.839 --> 18:47.588
ability to simulate and learn English was lacking 
because most... None of the students could speak

18:48.125 --> 18:51.568
English. None of the students. We'd go in the 
playground and we'd holler and joke and speak to

18:52.269 --> 18:59.336
one and the other in Spanish. On the second grade in 
San Jacinto School, we moved to an environment

19:00.357 --> 19:09.567
where more English and American people were 
living at that time. What was the name of... I

19:14.271 --> 19:14.892
forgot. And consequently we had more of a 
intermingling with the Anglo-American children

19:16.238 --> 19:30.997
and we started playing and calling a bat and a 
football and give me this and give me that. And most

19:31.978 --> 19:43.933
of the, I guess, the vocabularies was built in the 
playgrounds or in communications with other

19:31.978 --> 19:43.933
children. I don't think a vocabulary, actually 
the vocabulary was being built in the classrooms,

19:45.145 --> 19:58.708
though we had the words and spelling and whatnot. 
But I think the ability to adopt ourselves into

19:59.189 --> 20:09.988
thinking and speaking English came by 
associating with other English-speaking

19:59.189 --> 20:09.988
children. The Spanish-speaking children that 
you were growing up with, how many of them would you

20:12.466 --> 20:19.712
say had come to get away from the revolution? How 
many of them were refugees? A lot of them. Calderon

20:23.556 --> 20:27.119
families, Rocha family. Mr. Rocha had taken up his 
residence on San Antonio Street on the 1100 block,

20:29.441 --> 20:42.372
and he had been a general in Diaz's army. And most of 
the, there was an organization that was later

20:44.478 --> 20:56.054
started here called the Casino Social Mexicano, 
the Mexican casino. And all of them were of

20:56.114 --> 21:00.561
affluent people from Mexico. And they 
established quite a cultural

21:01.442 --> 21:06.930
club. And they gave and fiestas. parties, 
gatherings, social gatherings for the Mexican

21:14.667 --> 21:19.953
refugee. And Mrs. Terrazas would meet Mrs. 
Gonzalez and say, well, what did you get here? And

21:25.799 --> 21:26.940
so on. It was really, El Paso was a colony for the 
refugees, the affluent and the poor. Well, our

21:35.489 --> 21:44.218
period of transition from an affluent to a poor 
family came or was brought about in Mexico because

21:44.317 --> 21:56.393
we left as a broken down

21:44.317 --> 21:56.393
bankrupt affluent. And when we got here, we had 
nothing but the... You had had lands in Mexico.

22:03.283 --> 22:03.683
Yes. But you just let them go. Right. And we had no 
resources. here in the United States, and we did

22:10.321 --> 22:16.610
not bring with us any resources because we didn't 
have any. Was this true of most of the affluent

22:17.251 --> 22:30.148
refugee families, or did some of them manage to 
come in with... A lot of the families, the refugees

22:17.251 --> 22:30.148
of the affluent class, came in with their dollars 
and cents. And waiting for a time to get

22:31.670 --> 22:37.999
acclimated, Some of them remained and some of them 
went back.

22:44.539 --> 22:49.286
When did they begin going back, those that went 
back? I don't think they went back until after 1932

22:49.306 --> 23:04.527
because, or during the Depression, because 
Mexico was in a turmoil with different

22:49.306 --> 23:04.527
revolutions one right after another. And if I had 
been fleeing from the revolution because I was an

23:04.743 --> 23:15.036
effluent, I certainly wouldn't have gone back 
until there was a different form of government.

23:15.056 --> 23:27.112
But of course, as you know, the revolutionary 
party or the revolutionary element gained

23:15.056 --> 23:27.112
control of Mexico in the present time. They 
celebrate the victory of the revolution. And all

23:32.419 --> 23:33.400
of them that have become affluent were at one time a 
revolutionary element, let's put it like that, or

23:33.869 --> 23:43.987
their parents were. Some of these new fortunes 
that have been built have been built or have been

23:44.007 --> 23:52.502
acquired by individuals, children of the 
revolution.

23:58.051 --> 24:15.131
So if we had been affluent and had funds with which 
to go back to Mexico, I don't think her

23:58.051 --> 24:15.131
family, brothers and sisters, would have cared to 
go back to Mexico. Did you have any family that did

24:15.291 --> 24:18.054
stay in Mexico? That is, on your- Oh, yes. We had a 
lot of the family, members of the family that

24:20.237 --> 24:26.404
stayed in Mexico. My uncle, who had been 
Presidente Municipal of the city of Chihuahua,

24:27.886 --> 24:40.937
remained in Mexico in Chihuahua. He lost his 
shirt. He was involved in mining operations,

24:46.462 --> 24:56.391
money-making deals in property and whatnot, but 
he went broke. And most of the African people who

24:57.400 --> 25:01.647
remained in Mexico went broke. Their properties 
were confiscated.

25:05.814 --> 25:07.236
Some of them were executed. Your

25:07.277 --> 25:13.367
uncle's family now is his children. Are they still 
in Mexico?

25:19.439 --> 25:31.692
left Chihuahua and she came to reside here with 
relatives and she married here in El Paso, married

25:19.439 --> 25:31.692
an American citizen. And

25:31.712 --> 25:39.880
she had three children, a girl and two boys.

25:42.583 --> 25:46.847
One of the boys is a professor at the University 
Texas. His name is Provencio. You may know him. In

25:52.860 --> 25:53.941
what department is he in? I don't know. I think he's 
in the mathematics department. Jesus, not Jesus.

26:02.931 --> 26:05.033
What is his first name? Anyway, he is a professor 
and he was grandson of my uncle. His other two her

26:18.147 --> 26:19.888
other two children. are in Mexico, one of them 
decided to become an American, a Mexican citizen,

26:20.459 --> 26:32.453
though he was born here, they had dual 
nationality, and he took it upon himself. His name

26:32.513 --> 26:39.261
is Marcus, and Jesus Provencio, and what is the 
name of the girl? She decided to be an American, and

26:39.801 --> 26:48.171
she was working one time at the American Embassy in 
Mexico City.

26:54.496 --> 26:58.242
So there were different choices made at that time. 
Now, the Matas remained mother's

26:58.562 --> 27:05.253
relatives. They all remain in Mexico, the Mata 
family. Let me draw this out just a minute. I can get

27:10.962 --> 27:12.985
a clearer idea if I draw. See

27:13.025 --> 27:19.174
if I draw a picture. There's your mother and your 
father. Could I scoot up here a little bit? Yes, by

27:25.514 --> 27:28.959
all means.

27:29.980 --> 27:30.081
Okay. I got it. Okay. And let's see, your father's 
name was... My father's name was Francisco.

27:37.471 --> 27:39.734
Francisco... Galvan. G-A-L-V-A-N. And your 
mother's name was... Susanna.

27:47.685 --> 27:48.206
Marta. M-A-T-A. Galvan, by marriage.

27:58.756 --> 28:09.607
And then here are you and your brothers and 
sisters, and these would be...

27:58.756 --> 28:09.607
All right, your uncle, your father's brother 
stayed in Chihuahua. Yeah, Guadalupe Galvan.

28:11.549 --> 28:13.271
That's Guadalupe.

28:21.199 --> 28:26.805
And he was married to... A Cejas, Mercedes Cejas.

28:31.274 --> 28:34.340
And they were effluent to say hus. I don't know how 
to spell say hus. C-E-J-A-S, I'm guessing. Say.

28:39.791 --> 28:39.951
Say hus? Say hus. Let's

28:41.133 --> 28:47.947
see. I don't know. S-E-Y, say hus.

28:58.021 --> 28:59.582
Yeah. S-E-Y or S-E-I, I think, J-A-L-S,

29:00.083 --> 29:08.050
Cejas. No, never mind the L, just J-S. 
S-E-I-J-A-S,

29:08.531 --> 29:16.879
Cejas.

29:20.802 --> 29:26.147
Now, there was a very prominent attorney in Juarez 
and in Chihuahua by the name of Cejas. Mm-hmm.

29:27.265 --> 29:38.076
related or a brother of Mercedes.

29:38.096 --> 29:51.930
And the Cejas were a very affluent

29:38.096 --> 29:51.930
both cultural and economical

29:38.096 --> 29:51.930
family in Chihuahua. So my uncle married a very 
well-to-do family. Did they remain well-to-do

29:56.172 --> 29:58.495
after the revolution? I don't think so. But as far 
as you know, they stayed in Mexico. Yeah. Then they

30:08.528 --> 30:12.233
had these children you were mentioning who 
were... Marcos. Marcos, who stayed in Mexico.

30:14.435 --> 30:15.116
Right.

30:19.742 --> 30:20.243
Jesus. Jesus. Who was a professor at UTEP.

30:28.943 --> 30:31.005
And I don't remember the girl's name. And she also 
is an American citizen? An American citizen. When

30:37.553 --> 30:39.535
did these children come to the States? Do you 
remember? Yes, they were educated in the States.

30:44.922 --> 30:47.124
And all the children were born in the States. Oh. It 
was the... Guadalupe and Mercedes did come to the

30:48.105 --> 30:52.911
United... Wait a minute. Guadalupe and 
Mercedes... Remained in Mexico, and they had a

30:55.775 --> 30:58.899
daughter here. Oh, I missed it. Okay, I missed... 
They just had the one daughter. That's right. And

31:02.744 --> 31:03.545
she... Okay. I missed a generation. Yeah. Okay, 
they had a daughter. Whose name? Do you remember

31:08.811 --> 31:09.813
her name? Mercedes. Mercedes.

31:13.537 --> 31:20.466
Who married...

31:13.537 --> 31:20.466
Provencio. Provencio. In El Paso. Provencio, 
what was his last name? That's his last name. Oh,

31:27.586 --> 31:28.627
that's his last name. Mr. Provencio, I don't 
remember his last name. And he was from El Paso. He

31:33.313 --> 31:34.414
was from El Paso.

31:38.860 --> 31:41.363
And then their children were educated in the 
States. Were born here in El Paso and were educated

31:41.383 --> 31:45.908
in the States. I think he, Marcus, went to 
University of Colorado, both of them. And I don't

31:53.487 --> 31:55.729
know where she went to Laredo here. And then when 
they became of age, Marcus went to Mexico and took

31:57.330 --> 32:03.756
up his Mexican citizenship. And he remained in the 
United States as a professor and used to work. He

32:12.224 --> 32:21.132
had quite a hard time getting his professorship

32:12.224 --> 32:21.132
because he had one time moved to Juarez and was 
involved in a, mind you, an engineer, electrical

32:21.449 --> 32:34.665
engineer, going to Juarez and becoming a TV 
repairman.

32:37.177 --> 32:41.763
And I said, Marcos, I mean, Chuy, you're wasting 
your talents. What are you doing in Mexico? You

32:44.226 --> 32:45.928
know you're not a Mexican citizen. You know you 
were born in the United States, and you have a

32:45.988 --> 32:49.272
college. You have a degree in, I think, an 
electrical engineer from Colorado University.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.365
What are you doing in Mexico there? I said, you 
better move back to the United States right away.

33:04.332 --> 33:06.154
You're illegally in Mexico.

33:08.699 --> 33:11.001
You come over here, and we'll push you. What are you 
doing there? I can't understand an educated man

33:14.044 --> 33:16.487
like you. So I was influential in getting him back 
here in the United States. This was Jesus. That's

33:22.993 --> 33:24.915
right, the professor right now. Did he ever say why 
it was that he went back? No. I think he was

33:29.720 --> 33:38.048
influenced by Mother or Marcus.

33:39.479 --> 33:43.124
Marcus had a very good position, an engineer in 
Mexico City.

33:45.868 --> 34:01.970
They're very nice people, and of course we never 
have had any disagreement at all, but a political

33:45.868 --> 34:01.970
view, and I suggested to Marcus that he quit 
associating himself in Mexico. Not because I hate

34:03.132 --> 34:09.300
Mexico, because I thought it was wasting his 
opportunity. that he had become educated in the

34:09.753 --> 34:13.097
States. And then going down there and becoming an 
engineer of a radio station that wasn't paying him

34:14.079 --> 34:21.408
anything. And just because he was an engineer and 
had the title of an engineer, he's got a title here

34:21.468 --> 34:28.478
of an engineer. Now he's got the title of a 
professor. And he, of course, realizes that I was

34:31.261 --> 34:35.727
right in advising him.

34:38.761 --> 34:42.966
Did you think there's really more opportunity for 
a person in this country than in Mexico? Oh,

34:43.186 --> 34:44.047
surely. The integrity of the nation,

34:44.087 --> 35:03.910
the integrity of our law, the opportunities

34:44.087 --> 35:03.910
now that are being offered. I have always told my 
constituents that we are worth two

35:07.786 --> 35:20.432
Anglo-Americans because we have two different 
cultures. And that we had not been paid

35:21.955 --> 35:28.208
accordingly because it was our fault. And it was 
our fault because we did not exploit or use our

35:29.943 --> 35:41.536
talents to the full degree and to the fullness of 
our capacities. And that we were to show the

35:43.338 --> 35:56.794
industry that we were by linguists and by culture 
and dedicated to our tasks and we would be able to

35:58.073 --> 36:07.267
show them that we were worthy of certain 
considerations. And of course I think presently

36:08.849 --> 36:25.954
there has been the swinging of the pendulum that 
have recognized the individual for what he's

36:08.849 --> 36:25.954
worth and not what he used to be nor the color of his 
skin nor the color of his eyes. How much of this do

36:29.328 --> 36:51.573
you think is partly a matter of time, that with so 
many of the people who came from Mexico having come

36:29.328 --> 36:51.573
just at the early part of this century, that maybe, 
you know, it's the story of so many other people who

36:29.328 --> 36:51.573
have come from so many other places, that it's a 
matter of perhaps the first generation of

36:29.328 --> 36:51.573
adjustment and then the real potential being 
recognized. Right. Well, it has here in the United

36:52.494 --> 36:55.317
States. through the efforts of the government, 
Equal Employment Opportunity Council, of which I

36:55.786 --> 37:12.844
was the chairman, and the own minority groups to be 
able to show that they have the talent. And

37:14.345 --> 37:24.055
eventually, the discrimination of classes, 
discrimination of races, are fast disappearing.

37:30.661 --> 37:39.650
Oh, I can remember here when they had signs, no 
Mexicans allowed in public places. And I can

37:41.011 --> 37:49.139
remember when Bowie High School was refused a ROTC 
unit. I went and spoke to the school board about it.

37:53.414 --> 38:11.398
And it has come to pass that what I said, and that's 
why the president gave me this recognition, that

37:53.414 --> 38:11.398
it has come to pass that all the prophecies and all 
our dreams are gradually becoming realities. But

38:12.520 --> 38:18.628
it wasn't a reality that had to come overnight and 
quickly. It was a reality that came into and is

38:19.047 --> 38:41.308
continuing to be carried on forward because of 
the, first of all, the, let's call it, if we may, the

38:19.047 --> 38:41.308
tolerance that the majority had or had given, 
finally, the minority. Well, they call it

38:42.537 --> 38:48.705
tolerance and we call it a vested inherent right 
that we had. But call it what it may, it has

38:49.426 --> 38:58.078
gradually developed into the recognition of the 
talents of the minority. Well, when you first When

39:01.387 --> 39:07.596
you first came to El Paso, was there that much 
discrimination against people of Mexican

39:01.387 --> 39:07.596
origin? It was when you first, in the very 
beginning. Oh, in the very beginning, yes. In the

39:11.762 --> 39:20.235
very beginning, there was this discrimination 
that we did not become aware of it until we started

39:11.762 --> 39:20.235
growing up and finding out. And just like I said in 
the White House, and like I told them here just

39:20.275 --> 39:30.870
recently, why were there two different 
outhouses? Never heard that for El Paso. Oh, yes.

39:35.585 --> 39:52.090
In El Paso, in the Washington Park, a public place 
where the children of the Ale inhabitants would go

39:35.585 --> 39:52.090
on a Sunday afternoon to play. There would be an 
outhouse, a red brick building for whites, for

39:53.773 --> 40:01.144
Mexicans, and colored. And this from the very 
early period? Early period, as soon as I started to

40:05.362 --> 40:13.593
be able to find my way to the Washington Park by 
riding a streetcar. And this applied to the

40:13.613 --> 40:19.021
children of the very affluent who had come during 
the Revolution? Everybody without any... They

40:21.624 --> 40:24.188
were not according to themselves. They were not 
Mexicans. They were Spanish.

40:30.554 --> 40:32.917
Well then, which restroom did they use? They had to 
use a restroom that said for Mexicans or blacks.

40:41.710 --> 40:45.456
And I, of course, I'm a great kidder, public 
speaking. I said, I don't know what was wrong with

40:46.717 --> 40:49.602
our insides.

40:52.305 --> 40:53.728
Were they white? The Anglo-American perfumed 
inside?

41:04.557 --> 41:09.503
Do you have any idea when this distinction arose? 
Because, after all, El Paso was settled by Spanish

41:09.663 --> 41:15.109
Mexicans. And, you know, like, they were here 
first. And the Anglos were really latecomers.

41:21.277 --> 41:29.086
Have you ever read, I'm sure you have, the Diary of 
the Pilgrims by Mr. Fleming? No, I haven't. I'll

41:29.847 --> 41:31.088
write it down.

41:33.835 --> 42:02.205
Mr. Fleming speaks and writes of the coming of the 
Pilgrims, and he writes a diary of everything that

41:33.835 --> 42:02.205
took place, including the mild standage and his 
army of twenty men, and how they finally settled in

41:33.835 --> 42:02.205
Plymouth. And the pilgrims went out and 
investigated the surrounding territory and the

42:03.181 --> 42:11.595
characteristics of the territory. They found a 
bunch of sand mounds on the hill tops. They

42:17.165 --> 42:24.177
wondered what it was and they started digging into 
it and they found that it contained some vegetable

42:17.165 --> 42:24.177
matters. a vegetable that they had never seen 
before. They took this vegetable and removed it in

42:29.019 --> 42:35.811
their ears and they found out it had a cob and little 
grains. They took it into the Mayflower and

42:36.312 --> 42:47.831
started investigating it and finally someone got 
the idea that it must be edible and they cooked it

42:36.312 --> 42:47.831
and they found out that it was corn. They named it 
corn. That was an introduction of corn. So they

42:52.983 --> 42:58.851
went back to this mountain, looked into them, and 
they found it full of ears of corn. So they start

42:59.853 --> 43:09.947
taking them into the Mayflower, when upon here 
comes a bunch of Indians shooting bows and arrows

42:59.853 --> 43:09.947
at them. And they said they were not welcomed in the 
United States or in this country by these savages.

43:15.735 --> 43:19.660
So they started building a cantonment 
fortification. They got through. And then one

43:20.587 --> 43:32.866
Sunday, little did they know why the 
vindictiveness of the Indian towards them and

43:20.587 --> 43:32.866
their hate. And one Sunday afternoon after church 
services, here comes a buxom Indian, knocks at the

43:34.228 --> 43:44.704
door of the cantonment and shows himself that he 
has no weapons. Miles Standage opens the doors and

43:45.241 --> 43:50.534
they aim the guns, the shotguns they had at this 
fellow. Then in perfect English he says, welcome

43:51.256 --> 43:55.386
to America.
