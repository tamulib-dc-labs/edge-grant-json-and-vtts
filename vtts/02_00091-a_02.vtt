WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:10.227
In manner and style, John Koldis and Howard Perry as student administrators.

00:10.983 --> 00:22.159
I had had no experience with administrators like either one until that time.

00:22.540 --> 00:23.561
I thought they were great.

00:24.082 --> 00:25.404
I thought they were great people.

00:25.544 --> 00:26.786
I still do, of course.

00:27.947 --> 00:29.249
They worked well together.

00:30.711 --> 00:32.173
John would get mad at Perry.

00:32.214 --> 00:33.936
Perry would get mad at John.

00:34.372 --> 00:48.397
They would both get mad at all the rest of us on the staff, but nobody's feelings ever got hurt, and it was a very enjoyable relationship, it really was.

00:50.140 --> 00:52.684
Now you got here what time of the year?

00:54.200 --> 00:55.341
June.

00:56.322 --> 00:57.443
I think it was June.

00:57.523 --> 00:58.945
It was hot, I'll tell you that.

00:58.965 --> 01:01.667
And where did you all live?

01:02.468 --> 01:07.573
We bought a house, this house as a matter of fact.

01:09.175 --> 01:14.900
When we came down here the first time, that's how certain we were that we were coming back.

01:14.921 --> 01:16.262
We bought this house.

01:17.723 --> 01:19.465
Pat Smith was the realtor.

01:19.445 --> 01:25.814
Bill Vance was living two or three doors away and was our lawyer then.

01:25.894 --> 01:29.038
Was it a brand new house?

01:29.058 --> 01:29.539
This house?

01:29.579 --> 01:34.706
It was about eleven, I think ten or eleven years old at that time.

01:35.327 --> 01:40.574
And it's now, gee, we've been here what, twenty-five, twenty-six years?

01:41.235 --> 01:46.903
So it's thirty-plus years old.

01:46.883 --> 01:52.212
How was it, what was it like to move into this for you and your wife, to move into this new community?

01:52.593 --> 01:56.300
It was, well of course the house itself was bigger than we were used to.

01:56.320 --> 02:02.310
We loved it because we had four boys then.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.534
And the neighborhood was full of kids.

02:05.615 --> 02:10.341
There was the Popes, Dave Pope and his family.

02:11.222 --> 02:20.535
At the time that we moved in, there was the guy who has the office machine business.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.038
I can't remember his name.

02:23.561 --> 02:26.106
But shortly after that, the Bowers moved in.

02:26.166 --> 02:31.717
And across the street, there were the Woods.

02:32.618 --> 02:37.428
He was a retired TTI.

02:37.468 --> 02:39.872
Is it TTI?

02:39.892 --> 02:42.878
Texas Transportation.

02:43.448 --> 02:46.260
The whole neighborhood was full of kids and we just loved that.

02:46.823 --> 02:49.193
And that worked out so beautifully, it really did.

02:49.233 --> 02:52.969
And was it easy for a North Carolinian to

02:53.371 --> 02:56.554
accept and be accepted in Texas?

02:56.574 --> 02:57.835
Yes, I think so.

02:59.056 --> 03:00.558
Wheezy certainly had no trouble.

03:01.679 --> 03:09.065
She was president of the Medical Society Women's Auxiliary before long.

03:10.427 --> 03:14.390
Charles Behrens had come on the staff of the Health Center then.

03:14.450 --> 03:21.977
And Mildred Behrens, his wife, was president another year.

03:21.957 --> 03:23.839
Yeah, no, there was no difficulty.

03:25.341 --> 03:27.204
There was none for me that I recall.

03:27.524 --> 03:31.829
What about your relations with the local medical community?

03:32.610 --> 03:33.551
Good, good.

03:34.212 --> 03:43.804
I joined the medical, county medical society right away and was very happy.

03:44.485 --> 03:48.370
And no one in any way gave you the impression

03:48.805 --> 03:52.714
that there were some problems at the health center that you needed to unravel?

03:53.074 --> 03:53.295
No.

03:53.395 --> 03:54.778
Some mess you needed to clean up?

03:54.818 --> 03:55.059
No.

03:55.239 --> 03:55.780
Nothing like that?

03:55.800 --> 03:56.823
No, they didn't.

03:58.626 --> 04:04.840
If they knew what the situation was at the health center, nobody ever talked about it.

04:05.967 --> 04:14.000
But you see things are improving all along as we talk here and as we move into the new building.

04:14.020 --> 04:18.368
And that's when I first met Jack, of course, when we went into the new building.

04:18.828 --> 04:20.491
Was the building already designed?

04:20.912 --> 04:21.613
Yes.

04:21.593 --> 04:24.016
Yes, as a matter of fact, and there.

04:24.978 --> 04:34.391
And I don't remember when I first went through it, but I had to wear a hard hat, so it was early on.

04:37.896 --> 04:41.121
Describe your impressions of that new building.

04:41.725 --> 04:42.746
Oh, I thought it was beautiful.

04:43.027 --> 04:45.130
I thought it was absolutely gorgeous from the outside.

04:45.150 --> 04:48.435
I couldn't tell a great deal about the inside.

04:49.336 --> 04:56.646
As it turned out, I loved the inside, the art collection, the furniture.

04:56.686 --> 05:08.323
Francis Goff, incidentally, the nurse, had a great deal to do with design and ideas about that building.

05:08.793 --> 05:10.335
that she didn't get credit for.

05:11.716 --> 05:21.668
Got to know the people in facilities and planning and the people who would do the furnishings.

05:21.908 --> 05:27.034
Then people began to consult with us as to what we wanted.

05:29.197 --> 05:29.878
It was great.

05:29.938 --> 05:30.779
It was really great.

05:31.099 --> 05:35.965
When we finally added, when we completely outgrew that building as we did,

05:36.603 --> 06:05.125
We began planning an addition, and I absolutely insisted, and this was hard for them to do, it really was, the architects up there in Allison, north of Dallas, that the exterior not, that it not look added on at the outside, that it be the same stuff that the original health center was.

06:05.105 --> 06:06.607
Very hard for them to do.

06:07.247 --> 06:08.809
But they did an excellent job.

06:08.909 --> 06:10.150
They did an excellent job.

06:11.432 --> 06:26.167
As you began the real routine, what were some of the ways in which you discovered what Aggies really are?

06:27.268 --> 06:32.614
What were some of the health needs they had and the way they came over?

06:34.113 --> 06:35.555
Yeah.

06:35.635 --> 06:45.471
We had them all sign in at the front desk, a little card that was kept on file that as far as I know, nobody ever looked at again.

06:45.531 --> 06:51.220
But nevertheless, they signed in with their complaint and they were routed.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.585
If it was just a cold, they were routed to the cold clinic.

06:55.687 --> 06:59.192
If it was anything of any possible consequence,

06:59.527 --> 07:02.255
Otherwise, they were routed back to the clinic.

07:03.960 --> 07:08.332
They had all the interesting things that they signed in with.

07:09.055 --> 07:14.751
I'll never forget one guy who signed in with a backache.

07:14.731 --> 07:16.734
When I went out, I called him.

07:17.194 --> 07:20.379
They sat outside the doors of the individual offices.

07:21.340 --> 07:27.328
He was in such a position as I think a contortionist couldn't get in.

07:27.388 --> 07:29.271
Didn't even realize it.

07:29.291 --> 07:35.159
I said, okay, you've got a backache, you know, and you're sitting like this.

07:35.179 --> 07:41.127
Another guy, his complaint was insomnia, and of course, he was sound asleep.

07:41.107 --> 07:45.213
A lot of interesting experiences like that.

07:49.139 --> 07:53.585
We, I had, I treated one student with AIDS, which was so tragic.

07:54.827 --> 07:56.089
One of the nicest.

07:56.329 --> 07:57.491
About when was that?

07:58.572 --> 07:59.594
Early in the year or late?

07:59.614 --> 08:02.478
That would have been in, you mean early in the school year?

08:02.538 --> 08:08.667
No, no, early in your time or late?

08:10.925 --> 08:14.330
Either somebody told me, I suppose Frances may have told me.

08:14.390 --> 08:17.014
Frances was my mentor in a way.

08:17.935 --> 08:24.004
She would say, I don't think you can do that, or Aggies don't do it that way, or something like that.

08:28.630 --> 08:33.237
This guy was such a nice guy.

08:33.875 --> 08:38.362
He had nothing, had no private means of being treated.

08:39.063 --> 08:40.104
He had been treated.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.807
They had started treatment in Houston.

08:42.688 --> 08:52.323
He had an indwelling catheter up here, subclavian it is, with about three injection sites.

08:52.363 --> 08:57.250
He had stuff, I don't remember precisely what it was now,

08:57.230 --> 09:00.056
But nobody would do it for him.

09:00.076 --> 09:10.699
So I admitted him as an inpatient and saw to it that he was the only one in the room and really

09:13.413 --> 09:29.160
wrestled with the idea of whether I should say this guy has AIDS and that's why we're sort of semi-isolating him here and that's why I'm treating him personally and no one else is and that sort of thing.

09:30.457 --> 09:31.439
I don't remember.

09:31.459 --> 09:36.268
I must have told some of the nurses because they had to know, but I didn't tell anybody else.

09:40.395 --> 09:47.268
I don't know whether it was Francis or not who told me that I shouldn't do that, but I was going to do that.

09:47.709 --> 09:49.933
I did that.

09:51.601 --> 09:59.072
There were a fair number of things, situations like that, that I ran into that I shouldn't have been doing.

09:59.593 --> 10:03.518
But for the sake of the student, I was the only one that could do it.

10:05.221 --> 10:10.048
That is the example that I remember so well.

10:12.070 --> 10:17.018
We had students who would go out on leave.

10:17.098 --> 10:24.451
We'd give them leave and they'd go out and they'd come back drunk and if they did it more than once we'd kick them out and tell them they couldn't come back.

10:25.412 --> 10:26.514
We didn't mean it really.

10:28.918 --> 10:35.850
We had flu epidemics and we filled, I mean filled, you know what the health center looks like.

10:35.830 --> 10:41.059
the capacity it would have had the second floor because that was all inpatients then.

10:41.079 --> 10:45.145
We had the place absolutely filled.

10:45.165 --> 10:57.045
We had every bed we could get our hands on with curtains around and I suppose we had maybe 40 or mid 40s even

10:57.025 --> 11:02.192
inpatients at any given time during that particular epidemic.

11:02.592 --> 11:05.757
About how many times did that sort of epidemic occur?

11:06.197 --> 11:06.718
Once a year.

11:06.778 --> 11:07.899
Once a year.

11:07.939 --> 11:08.941
Normally about when?

11:10.443 --> 11:11.484
Soon after Christmas?

11:11.905 --> 11:12.145
Right.

11:12.365 --> 11:24.021
Usually after Christmas when the students would bring back their new viruses and they would give them to other students who weren't, had not been exposed to them over Christmas until spring semester.

11:24.501 --> 11:25.783
Then it stopped.

11:25.763 --> 11:29.489
Was it more likely to be the male or female students?

11:29.509 --> 11:29.770
Both.

11:30.090 --> 11:30.511
Both.

11:32.133 --> 11:33.235
Uh-huh.

11:33.335 --> 11:35.980
That's certainly one way we didn't discriminate.

11:36.040 --> 11:43.893
We didn't put a girl and a guy in the same room, but they were all mixed up otherwise.

11:46.216 --> 11:51.585
Shortly, I get way ahead of myself, but shortly after I left, they closed

11:52.004 --> 11:55.488
the outpatient, the second floor altogether.

11:56.469 --> 12:07.863
And I don't think now, and I must say I haven't been out there to see it because I've had nothing really in common with the people out there now, don't even know them.

12:09.986 --> 12:20.779
But I understand that there's no medical services on the second floor at all, that they're, oh,

12:24.539 --> 12:26.182
That's a word I want.

12:27.505 --> 12:31.252
People who advise you what to do or what not to do and that sort of thing.

12:33.736 --> 12:38.826
Some of the Wade Birch's group.

12:40.810 --> 12:41.451
What is that?

12:43.253 --> 12:44.135
Counseling Center?

12:44.155 --> 12:45.679
Counseling Center, yeah, of course.

12:48.525 --> 12:51.251
But at any rate, they just wiped us out.

12:51.752 --> 13:00.773
One of the very first things they did when I left, and again, I still get ahead of myself, but one of the first things they did when I left

13:02.288 --> 13:05.592
was to change the front doors.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.935
We had a lot of trouble with the front doors.

13:07.955 --> 13:13.943
They were big, they were heavy, they were hard to open, they were hard to close, they would come off their hinges.

13:15.164 --> 13:17.387
Had a lot of trouble with them.

13:17.467 --> 13:23.655
I complained from the year one about those big doors.

13:23.635 --> 13:34.310
Well I suppose probably I hadn't been retired more than a few months before those doors were changed and they were glass and now they're glass.

13:34.971 --> 13:35.973
They closed the kitchen.

13:35.993 --> 13:50.233
That was so dear to my heart really because we could serve inpatients and then of course they stopped having inpatients too so they didn't really need the kitchen.

13:50.213 --> 13:53.519
And I could get real, real cool.

13:53.579 --> 14:00.352
The nurses criticized me terribly for keeping the air conditioning turned so far down.

14:00.412 --> 14:08.627
And that sometimes I would go in the walk-in refrigerator and sit down and cool off in there.

14:08.945 --> 14:10.529
So I didn't have that anymore.

14:12.274 --> 14:20.575
Once you kind of got settled in, in the early years, describe a typical day's routine.

14:22.090 --> 14:30.401
We would see probably as many as average 400, give or take a few, patients.

14:30.762 --> 14:31.924
That's a lot of people.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.288
And this was when staff was a little low.

14:35.328 --> 14:36.430
I'd say five of us.

14:36.690 --> 14:38.753
And beginning at what time of day?

14:38.773 --> 14:40.656
Beginning at 8, officially.

14:40.676 --> 14:45.042
And I rode with Perry every day.

14:45.102 --> 14:46.123
He picked me up.

14:46.103 --> 14:54.893
And if we got there at 7 o'clock, as we sometimes did, I would open the doors at 7 and somebody walked in and there was something I could take care of and did.

14:55.774 --> 14:59.258
And we were supposed to close at 5, and we did close the front doors at 5.

15:01.060 --> 15:06.326
But then the students went upstairs for their outpatient service.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.850
They got to the point that sometimes they abused that.

15:09.830 --> 15:18.024
But we just hung in there with it because we wanted round-the-clock service.

15:21.911 --> 15:24.295
So 400 patients.

15:24.315 --> 15:28.042
The most we ever saw in a single day was 699.

15:28.182 --> 15:34.453
Now those were sign-ins at the front desk.

15:34.433 --> 15:46.271
wanted lab work and some wanted x-rays and some wanted lacerations sutured and some had colds and so forth and so on, the whole gamut.

15:46.571 --> 15:52.660
And for that four to six hundred, there were how many MDs at work during that day?

15:53.021 --> 15:58.008
There were usually five.

15:59.029 --> 16:00.812
And I say usually, they left

16:03.104 --> 16:05.587
as quickly as they could after five o'clock.

16:05.687 --> 16:06.889
I mean, they just disappeared.

16:08.591 --> 16:20.007
One of the physicians, and I tell you because it's interesting, one of the physicians would sneak out of the building when he thought I didn't know anything about it.

16:21.008 --> 16:23.652
And he would, and the door was only a one-way door.

16:23.812 --> 16:29.820
It was in the new addition and it, of course, couldn't close or he would have to come into the front door again.

16:30.475 --> 16:37.926
He would put a book of matches in the door so it wouldn't close, and I would go and take the matches out.

16:37.946 --> 16:39.648
So he'd have to come in the front.

16:40.489 --> 16:45.997
Another one would say, well, I'm not going to see any patients until he sees patients.

16:46.538 --> 16:52.507
And he would sit there with the door closed with the hall full of students reading the newspaper.

16:54.249 --> 16:55.731
I got pretty upset.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.896
I hated to get upset in front of students.

16:58.876 --> 17:03.423
Uh, and I almost, I just, I always try to do it behind closed doors.

17:04.405 --> 17:09.133
But, but these, sometimes these grown men had to be treated like children.

17:09.634 --> 17:14.742
And, uh, were the, in, in those years, were they all, all the MDs were male?

17:15.498 --> 17:15.858
Yes.

17:17.000 --> 17:24.490
The first MD, the first female was Barbara Tyler who was a graduate of our medical school.

17:25.751 --> 17:32.580
And then Peggy Shelton, both of whom were good.

17:32.660 --> 17:33.922
Barbara is still there.

17:35.043 --> 17:36.505
Peggy is smart as a whip.

17:37.687 --> 17:39.349
She's much older of course now.

17:41.111 --> 17:44.796
But she was hard, it was hard for her to get along with Barbara.

17:44.776 --> 17:45.691
Uh...

17:46.160 --> 17:58.390
And during those years, did UMDs differentiate between what problems you dealt with or did you take whatever?

17:58.410 --> 17:59.211
Yes and no.

17:59.631 --> 18:04.796
We would refer students among ourselves or between ourselves.

18:06.617 --> 18:11.521
If we got to a knotty problem, we would consult with each other, yeah.

18:11.761 --> 18:16.065
What was your normal concentration or preference?

18:16.045 --> 18:21.334
I had an office just like the rest of them and saw patients there.

18:21.354 --> 18:26.783
This was when they didn't make appointments, it was just walk-ins.

18:27.725 --> 18:33.835
And I would also take care of the treatment room, which was right across the hall from my office.

18:33.815 --> 18:37.261
And I wanted it that way because I wanted to take care of the treatment room.

18:37.562 --> 18:40.988
Treatment room means lacerations.

18:42.391 --> 18:49.204
It means the injections.

18:50.646 --> 18:57.038
Well, all injections really.

18:57.018 --> 19:04.887
Acute, non-fatal you might say, injuries.

19:05.407 --> 19:06.929
Did you handle a broken arm?

19:06.989 --> 19:08.931
Oh yes, sprains, strains.

19:09.452 --> 19:20.564
If a fracture could be, I did many fracture, fingers and wrists and that sort of thing.

19:20.604 --> 19:23.667
I didn't attempt big things.

19:23.647 --> 19:26.553
I certainly was not an orthopedist.

19:26.593 --> 19:29.599
We would schedule those for special clinics.

19:29.719 --> 19:34.127
But I did all kinds of plastering and suturing.

19:34.628 --> 19:35.831
I loved to do those things.

19:36.051 --> 19:36.592
I really did.

19:38.917 --> 19:42.764
So you got there to begin before 8.

19:43.526 --> 19:45.790
Then lunch was how long?

19:46.681 --> 19:50.015
Maybe half an hour, but it was in the building.

19:50.718 --> 19:54.795
I just went down, took the elevator down or the stairs down to the kitchen.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.944
And then the afternoon until about what time?

19:57.953 --> 19:59.716
Oh, I seldom.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.961
Weezy could tell you that better than I could.

20:02.582 --> 20:03.905
I seldom left the building.

20:04.967 --> 20:06.650
Perry would leave me gone.

20:07.812 --> 20:16.890
And I seldom left the building before, oh, 6.30, 7 o'clock.

20:16.870 --> 20:23.258
And depending on circumstances, if I were on call, I would might get call back.

20:24.359 --> 20:30.366
And that was like every fifth day, weekday and every fifth weekend.

20:30.387 --> 20:38.997
I had two physicians who I saw a lot of trouble with.

20:38.977 --> 20:44.227
One has since retired and one I fired at the time.

20:45.450 --> 20:59.297
And the people who argue their cases and decide whether they really should be fired or they can come back to work, whoever, we had those hearings.

20:59.277 --> 21:02.362
I remember Malin helped me with those.

21:04.085 --> 21:06.870
But anyway, I fired them.

21:08.953 --> 21:11.457
One of them was scheduled for a weekend.

21:12.799 --> 21:18.228
He maintained that he had switched the weekend with somebody else.

21:18.248 --> 21:22.956
That was all right as long as they kept it covered, you know.

21:22.936 --> 21:28.805
And the other one said, no, you didn't switch with me.

21:28.965 --> 21:30.067
I'm not working this weekend.

21:30.448 --> 21:32.611
The other one said, well, I'm not working this weekend.

21:33.032 --> 21:35.375
Well, I thought they would break down.

21:35.395 --> 21:39.121
I thought they would break down and one of the other of them would show up, you know.

21:39.662 --> 21:40.944
I worked the whole weekend.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.408
Monday morning, bright and early.

21:44.536 --> 21:49.381
I had a little talk with them and fired them right then and there, as bad as we needed people.

21:50.482 --> 21:53.045
Almost, at that point, warm bodies.

21:54.546 --> 22:03.716
And they both, no, I beg your pardon, one of them didn't complain to that commission, whoever it is.

22:04.757 --> 22:05.918
He stayed fired.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.944
The other one did, and I was forced to rehire him.

22:13.257 --> 22:22.893
He never spoke another word to me for, I'd say, probably upwards of a year and a half.

22:23.634 --> 22:24.555
Never another word.

22:25.437 --> 22:38.438
And, of course, I made a special effort to speak to him so that there was no question about who the culprit was here.

22:39.059 --> 22:44.106
Do you remember the first football season and or the first bonfire?

22:45.909 --> 22:46.229
Yes.

22:46.730 --> 22:50.976
I can't swear to the first bonfire, but I do remember the first football season.

22:51.917 --> 22:54.361
And that came as a surprise.

22:56.103 --> 23:02.552
Nobody told me that we were supposed to offer medical coverage for the football games.

23:02.532 --> 23:07.702
And I was just into it, you know, and that was it.

23:08.664 --> 23:12.572
Athletic department had gave me tickets to football games.

23:13.013 --> 23:15.678
So I thought, oh great, I'm going to get to see football games.

23:16.419 --> 23:19.085
Well, I hardly ever got to see a football game.

23:19.225 --> 23:22.752
I certainly never got to see an entire one.

23:22.732 --> 23:29.400
In the heat, which of course there was plenty of at the first of the season, we saw heat strokes.

23:31.002 --> 23:34.666
When it was windy, we saw people with things in their eyes.

23:36.048 --> 23:44.318
When it was raining, we saw people who got umbrellas stuck in their eyes, the outer prongs.

23:45.580 --> 23:46.901
Alcohol related?

23:47.162 --> 23:47.582
Some.

23:48.042 --> 23:49.083
Some, but very few.

23:49.144 --> 23:51.166
Far fewer than you would expect.

23:52.687 --> 23:53.168
Falls?

23:53.828 --> 23:54.269
Stumbles?

23:54.369 --> 23:55.470
Falls, yes.

23:57.932 --> 24:08.102
Practically all of the beds, the tables, they actually were, in the one room that we had then were full all the time.

24:08.783 --> 24:09.664
There was someone there.

24:10.104 --> 24:13.748
So you would go to the football game, but then have to go back to the health center?

24:14.082 --> 24:19.253
No, we had a little room, a single room at the stadium.

24:19.353 --> 24:31.298
Later we campaigned and were successful in getting, especially when they added on to the stadium, new additional first aid rooms.

24:31.278 --> 24:32.880
We also had an ambulance.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.522
We had no ambulance to begin with.

24:34.542 --> 24:36.165
We had no way of transporting people.

24:38.488 --> 24:43.815
The first ambulance we had was given to us by a mother of a student.

24:45.337 --> 24:46.338
It was a station wagon.

24:46.378 --> 24:47.500
It was his station wagon.

24:47.980 --> 24:53.067
They always got him a new station wagon every year so she gave us his old station wagon.

24:53.047 --> 24:54.829
And we transported people.

24:56.591 --> 24:57.452
That was our ambulance.

24:57.472 --> 24:59.033
We transported people in that thing.

24:59.634 --> 25:02.557
And sometimes their noses were touching the top of the roof.

25:03.138 --> 25:08.663
And one time we had to roll down the back window for a guy's feet to stick out.

25:08.683 --> 25:09.664
That was a lot of fun.

25:09.865 --> 25:19.575
But then we got, I talked John into, I say I talked John into, I think Perry helped too, getting an actual ambulance, not a big one.

25:19.995 --> 25:21.737
Now they have a much bigger one.

25:21.717 --> 25:32.390
And of course we had all kinds of complaints of hot rodders and that sort of thing, which I fully expected and always defended the EMTs.

25:32.810 --> 25:38.017
Then we got a new, when we put the new addition on the health center, we put a room for the EMTs.

25:38.077 --> 25:42.342
So they stayed there around the clock.

25:42.322 --> 25:46.127
But, so that was my football experience.

25:46.467 --> 25:52.475
Well, it got a little bit less, a little bit better and better as we got more EMTs down there.

25:52.916 --> 25:58.943
They would do much of the stuff that I had been doing and call me if they got in trouble.

25:59.003 --> 25:59.624
Are you saying EMTs?

25:59.804 --> 26:05.732
EMTs, Emergency Medical Technician.

26:05.752 --> 26:06.533
Oh, okay.

26:06.553 --> 26:08.636
Paramedics, you'd think of these days.

26:08.916 --> 26:09.797
Who funded that?

26:12.022 --> 26:12.964
The health center.

26:12.984 --> 26:15.170
The health center.

26:15.511 --> 26:23.652
They, they were a committee of the MSC, but I don't believe they got any money from them.

26:24.475 --> 26:29.123
So they either had to use their own money or the health center actually funded them.

26:30.044 --> 26:33.349
Well I know we did because we gave them supplies from the health center.

26:33.790 --> 26:35.793
We had the ambulance for them.

26:37.837 --> 26:41.082
We had the call room for them.

26:41.142 --> 26:42.605
We gave them the radio equipment.

26:45.289 --> 26:45.910
We funded them.

26:46.010 --> 26:47.012
The health center funded them.

26:47.252 --> 26:49.656
Now did the health center budget

26:49.720 --> 26:54.752
Was it enrollment-based so that as the enrollment went up, your funding went up?

26:57.398 --> 26:59.902
Not enrollment, no, it wasn't enrollment-based.

27:00.723 --> 27:16.347
At least to my knowledge, John may know more about that than I, but it was need-based as far as physicians, keeping good physicians like Dwayne Leggin, remember him?

27:18.991 --> 27:22.596
The best physician I ever had, he saved my life.

27:24.297 --> 27:27.141
When I had a coronary out there.

27:27.161 --> 27:30.506
I spelled his last name.

27:30.526 --> 27:31.307
L-A-G-A-N.

27:32.048 --> 27:38.397
He is the Director of Student Health Services at Virginia Tech.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.762
And occasionally I can see him on television, come out on the field.

27:44.165 --> 27:45.367
Wonderful, wonderful person.

27:46.589 --> 27:52.397
He just happened to be here one week after he had left.

27:54.470 --> 28:02.061
when I had a heart attack and rode in the ambulance with me to the St.

28:02.081 --> 28:02.802
Joseph Hospital.

28:03.483 --> 28:07.329
And he was right there when my heart stopped beating and did CPR.

28:07.389 --> 28:17.383
And I told him I felt like an elephant stepped on my, when I regained consciousness, that I felt like an elephant had stepped on my chest, you know.

28:17.844 --> 28:20.448
And of course it was just him.

28:20.588 --> 28:22.671
I'm sure he broke some bones or so.

28:22.651 --> 28:35.290
He left because of money and he wanted to, I think maybe he had a taste of the administrative and he wanted to do that too.

28:36.031 --> 28:37.433
So that's what he's doing right now.

28:38.895 --> 28:46.787
And I had very, very seldom hear from him and I haven't been up there to see him.

28:48.089 --> 28:51.814
He's in Blacksburg in the mountains.

28:52.891 --> 28:56.480
As you began to settle in, oh, excuse me.

28:57.061 --> 29:09.972
So we, our, to my knowledge, our additions to the staff and our budgets were not dependent on actual student enrollment, but on what we

29:09.952 --> 29:18.815
were able to scrounge out of John and Perry.

29:19.657 --> 29:22.424
Perry, of course, in particular, at budget time.

29:22.825 --> 29:25.211
Because the students paid no fee, did they?

29:25.231 --> 29:26.053
Paid no fee.

29:26.033 --> 29:26.694
That's right.

29:26.714 --> 29:27.655
For the no fee.

29:27.755 --> 29:30.959
Oh, they paid a student health center fee that the.

29:31.880 --> 29:32.781
It was collected over there.

29:32.942 --> 29:33.662
Right, right.

29:34.123 --> 29:40.731
I thought of it as an MSC fee, but that was collected in the fee office, not at the health center.

29:41.212 --> 29:44.756
What about the medicines that you all provided them?

29:44.776 --> 29:45.036
Free.

29:45.257 --> 29:45.617
Free.

29:45.637 --> 29:45.917
Free.

29:46.298 --> 29:52.586
How often did a non-student attempt to get treatment over there?

29:52.606 --> 29:53.166
Very seldom.

29:53.527 --> 29:54.488
Very seldom.

29:55.008 --> 30:02.478
I incised some thrombosed hemorrhoids for non-students.

30:05.622 --> 30:20.222
I treated a lot of things that I wanted to, just because I wanted to, and sometimes I'll admit that I sort of tried to make it look like I was just having a friendly visit with the administrator who was there, you know.

30:20.202 --> 30:25.106
Which I was always, but you know, sometimes we did other things.

30:26.868 --> 30:39.539
I think the very, very first house call that I made was to Jack Williams' house when Margaret called me.

30:40.540 --> 30:41.781
I'll never forget the afternoon.

30:41.821 --> 30:49.348
It was a rainy, soggy sort of, the ground must have been soggy that deep afternoon.

30:49.328 --> 30:55.535
early afternoon, and she called and asked that I come over that Jack was having some kind of spells.

30:56.677 --> 30:58.839
And I did, and I was sitting there talking with him.

30:58.859 --> 31:00.661
He's talking just like we're talking.

31:01.663 --> 31:04.947
And all of a sudden he lost consciousness.

31:05.127 --> 31:06.068
Is this 76?

31:07.169 --> 31:10.593
Is this when he, is this when he, so I guess it is, yes.

31:11.214 --> 31:12.075
Yes, I guess it would be.

31:12.095 --> 31:14.238
Oh, please describe that as thoroughly as you can.

31:14.478 --> 31:14.858
Okay.

31:15.759 --> 31:18.002
As I said, I remember the day.

31:18.674 --> 31:25.478
being rainy, and it had been rainy and dreary, and Margaret Comey and I went over there.
