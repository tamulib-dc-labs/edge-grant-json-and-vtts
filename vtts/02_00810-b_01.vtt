WEBVTT

00:15.742 --> 00:23.833
This is the morning of November the 6th.

00:23.853 --> 00:31.583
I am in the lovely home of

00:23.853 --> 00:31.583
Professor Emeritus C.A. Bonnen, who is a member of 
the Department of Agricultural Economics at

00:31.643 --> 00:44.500
Texas A&M University, although he has been 
retired for many years. He retired, he says, in

00:45.762 --> 01:05.168
1961,

00:45.762 --> 01:05.168
but we are most anxious to get his

00:45.762 --> 01:05.168
response to some important questions, to 
capitalize on his rich experience. So CA, what I'd

01:06.731 --> 01:15.162
like to do is just ask you to respond to a few 
questions, and you just Give us your

01:16.947 --> 01:20.351
recollections of these things. You grew up on a 
farm in central Illinois. Born, you said, in 1896,

01:24.796 --> 01:34.368
so this was the turn of the century and the first 
decade into this new century. What was farm life

01:34.928 --> 01:36.971
like then? Well, it was pretty hard work. Tractors 
were just coming in. They weren't in general use.

01:51.568 --> 01:57.438
Of course, there were still a majority of the farm 
power. And

01:57.458 --> 02:07.515
that's the

01:57.458 --> 02:07.515
most I recall of it. I left the

02:07.535 --> 02:13.144
farm right after I graduated from the university. 
anything I'd say about corn at that time, which was

02:15.520 --> 02:23.227
1920.

02:25.549 --> 02:29.113
Did you harvest the corn by hand picking then? 
Yeah. Entirely, wasn't it? Did they have the wheel

02:32.316 --> 02:34.538
plow? Did you have a wheel plow or was it a hand plow? 
Do you recall? Did the plows have wheels? Yes. And

02:40.664 --> 02:43.266
you rode on them or were they hand plows? They had 
wheel plows. So you did have some relatively

02:47.843 --> 02:54.032
modern technology, didn't you? Yeah, such as it 
was. Did you have livestock besides the horses? Oh

03:00.982 --> 03:01.442
yes. Did you feed cattle or did you have hogs 
mostly? We had dairy cattle.

03:18.177 --> 03:23.124
So you think there's been a lot of changes in that 
farm in Illinois, hasn't there, C.A.? I imagine

03:23.144 --> 03:23.986
there has. Yeah. When did you last get back to 
Illinois to see the farming? Oh,

03:30.395 --> 03:39.930
right after I graduated from the university and 
that was 1920. I see. Well, the size of the farms are

03:42.190 --> 03:45.033
much, much larger.

03:47.797 --> 03:52.322
My family moved off the farm and moved to Urbana at 
that time.

03:57.368 --> 04:06.679
Well, what contributions do you believe that 
agricultural

03:57.368 --> 04:06.679
research As you've experienced it over the years, 
not just economics, but the whole agricultural

04:07.587 --> 04:19.385
research, what contributions has that made to 
farming in Illinois and Texas? Within what

04:19.405 --> 04:21.508
period? Since you were on that farm.

04:27.477 --> 04:29.180
That's right up until now. Right up until now. I 
haven't been back there to see what they've done.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.794
I'm sure it's changed a lot. Farms are larger, more 
power to use, all that sort of thing. I'm worried

04:50.028 --> 04:51.029
about changes.

04:53.672 --> 05:03.244
During those earlier years of your professional 
life, you were heavily involved in farm

04:53.672 --> 05:03.244
management research. and you were able to see some 
of the changes that were occurring in the way those

05:04.878 --> 05:12.866
farms were managed and operated. I'd really like 
to get your recollections of those kinds of

05:14.928 --> 05:22.556
changes. Well, of course there's been a lot of 
changes, especially in the older farming areas.

05:43.201 --> 05:53.175
The big change has been in the areas like East 
Texas, where we've practically gone out of

05:43.201 --> 05:53.175
farming. I don't plan to change ownership.

06:01.627 --> 06:08.998
Ownership is in the hands of people that used to 
live in Houston and places like that. Very little

06:09.018 --> 06:11.001
farming done. It's mostly forestry. sort of 
thing. In the other areas of

06:17.844 --> 06:40.782
Texas where farming is still going on, in the 
rolling plains, in the black lands, you've seen

06:17.844 --> 06:40.782
less dramatic changes in the sense that 
agriculture, the farming hasn't gone out of the

06:17.844 --> 06:40.782
areas, but What kind of changes did you see taking 
place while you were involved in research?

06:49.192 --> 06:58.344
Well, I recall that there was more irrigation on 
the plains and wherever they could get water.

07:01.568 --> 07:08.237
And of course,

07:01.568 --> 07:08.237
the types of farming further west you go, the tax of 
farming are pretty much the same.

07:15.493 --> 07:22.282
All it has changed is the power and that sort of 
thing.

07:22.302 --> 07:38.764
Do you feel that our profession of agricultural 
economics, and particularly in farm management,

07:22.302 --> 07:38.764
made some real contributions to agriculture in 
those years?

07:41.815 --> 07:44.100
It's pretty hard to say.

07:48.290 --> 07:52.700
Changes have taken place regardless, you know. I 
imagine we had some influence on me.

08:05.727 --> 08:20.963
As you look back, and this may not be a fair question 
to ask anybody, but

08:05.727 --> 08:20.963
you've had a chance to reflect on the profession 
and what you were doing. Do you see any areas where

08:22.825 --> 08:27.249
you think we missed the boat? Some things we ought 
to have done as agricultural economists and in

08:28.070 --> 08:35.498
farm management that we didn't do or things that we 
did incorrectly, inadequately? That's some

08:41.970 --> 08:48.457
question.

08:48.477 --> 09:03.716
I suppose there were some things that we should 
have done that we didn't do, but that would have

08:48.477 --> 09:03.716
been true of any group that existed at that time.

09:03.736 --> 09:05.137
We're all subject to change. Yes. How

09:06.595 --> 09:18.906
much change we would have made if we had known more 
than we did is a question even today. I think all

09:20.708 --> 09:27.414
these changes would have taken place whether we 
were here or not. Yes, they might have taken place

09:27.934 --> 09:34.560
differently had they not had access to our your 
studies see we our plan of studying the

09:35.840 --> 10:02.978
agriculture of texas was first a general study of 
the whole state and we drove 5 500 miles within the

09:35.840 --> 10:02.978
state to delineate those areas which i believe 
you've asked about and We spent a whole month

10:05.101 --> 10:19.544
making their trips through the state and checking 
the delineations and so on. And I believe you

10:19.564 --> 10:23.631
remarked that they were still about the same. Yes, 
one of the remarkable things that has occurred to

10:23.651 --> 10:32.104
me as I've looked back at that very classic study 
that you and a few of your colleagues made, you were

10:32.557 --> 10:36.522
certainly the prime mover in that study. And what 
impresses me is that after all these years,

10:37.563 --> 10:48.496
there's been very little change in the 
delineation of those types of farming. Yeah, of

10:48.737 --> 10:50.018
course. We had to begin with Dr. Carter's soil 
divisions, and we just refined and added an area

11:02.948 --> 11:11.779
here and there that seems different.

11:11.799 --> 11:19.568
And as they are today, you can look up his reports 
and see the difference.

11:21.670 --> 11:25.034
Well, that's of most interest.

11:27.718 --> 11:32.263
Reflecting a little bit on how our profession has 
changed in terms of graduate study at the

11:33.087 --> 11:36.912
institution. You first pursued graduate study at 
the University of Illinois in the 1920s. Then

11:43.720 --> 11:57.938
later in the 1930s, you did a year of graduate study 
at the Giannini Foundation and at the University

11:43.720 --> 11:57.938
of California at Berkeley. I'd be very much 
interested in getting your recollections of

12:03.698 --> 12:17.053
those individuals from whom you got classes and 
what the graduate study concentrated on at that

12:03.698 --> 12:17.053
time? Well, at Illinois, Professor Hanson, I 
don't know if you ever heard of him or not, he died

12:17.693 --> 12:24.861
rather young. He was head of the department.

12:32.302 --> 12:42.032
It was he that really steered me into the economics 
of the situation. And then

12:42.392 --> 12:54.664
California HR Polley was head of the HR 
department. And that's why I went there to

12:54.684 --> 12:58.748
graduate.

13:01.799 --> 13:05.705
He was a very fine individual.

13:08.148 --> 13:16.921
I got most of my

13:08.148 --> 13:16.921
so-called information from him and his 
associates. Who were some of the others? Was

13:18.683 --> 13:22.949
Adams, Professor Adams in farm management? He was 
there, but he didn't contribute much. He was kind

13:28.117 --> 13:29.038
of... behind the times. I see.

13:36.129 --> 13:38.252
Several others complained. He used an electric 
system and he got very little out of it. But H.R.

13:44.439 --> 13:45.520
Tolley was there too. Yes. And of course he saved 
the day and brought us into the so-called

13:46.581 --> 13:55.011
presence. Yes. Presence.

13:58.837 --> 14:04.545
Do you recall some of the others that were there at 
any foundation at that time?

14:07.248 --> 14:08.370
I'm trying to think of his name. He was head of the 
department at South Dakota when I was there.

14:13.116 --> 14:14.037
Benedict. Yes, Murray Benedict. Now, Murray did 
his later work in agricultural policy. I don't

14:22.248 --> 14:24.912
know what he was doing at that time.

14:27.878 --> 14:34.765
I didn't follow him very closely after he got

14:27.878 --> 14:34.765
out there. Polly was a big influence. Yes, 
influence in getting you there, and he was the one

14:36.246 --> 14:46.276
who most influenced you while you were there, when 
you were thinking. Was there anyone else at

14:46.296 --> 14:54.504
Illinois besides Professor Hanson that you 
recall in those early days? No, not that I... No,

14:58.017 --> 15:11.517
I didn't.

15:13.900 --> 15:25.577
Then you were on the faculty at South Dakota State 
for two years, and I understand that you were one of

15:13.900 --> 15:25.577
the of T.W. Schultz's earliest professors of 
agricultural economics. That's right. He's

15:32.667 --> 15:41.736
probably the most famous of our entire 
profession, and you've had an influence very

15:32.667 --> 15:41.736
early in his professional life.

15:45.560 --> 15:50.986
Ted has always given me more credit than I deserve. 
Well, I've regarded him as an honest man. But what

15:56.540 --> 16:00.824
was your impression of him when he was an 
undergraduate student? Well, he was older than

16:01.184 --> 16:07.170
the average student and an outstanding 
individual. But I had a class of about 12 boys at

16:08.391 --> 16:22.584
that time, and they were all young,

16:08.391 --> 16:22.584
bright individuals. I've never had a class like 
this. more outstanding than they were. And I wish I

16:27.384 --> 16:33.551
had kept up with them so that I could see what 
happened, but I didn't. I live in Chicago, Dakota

16:33.571 --> 16:35.273
right now. But you were able, you think, to sense in 
Ted Schultz as a student, somebody who had all the

16:37.956 --> 16:48.068
ingredients of greatness. Yeah, right from the 
beginning. Yeah, that's interesting.

16:55.484 --> 17:02.874
Well, we've

16:55.484 --> 17:02.874
talked about some of the early research. You 
didn't get heavily into research until you got

17:02.954 --> 17:08.081
down here, I guess. You did some at South Dakota in 
those two years, but in farm management, type of

17:08.101 --> 17:17.154
farming studies. Was that where you first began to 
work with Buck Elliott? Yeah, he was a friend of

17:22.922 --> 17:24.023
mine. He was at the USDA in Washington, or was he in 
Washington? He was in Washington, but you

17:29.404 --> 17:37.476
collaborated with him on research while you were 
at South Dakota. Very interesting. He was a fine

17:38.918 --> 17:41.662
individual. He didn't live long

17:41.682 --> 17:48.071
enough. I see. What was it that brought you to 
Texas?

17:55.627 --> 18:02.733
Mr.

17:55.627 --> 18:02.733
Gabbard was head of the department here. Yes. And, 
uh, Buck Elliott happened to come down here right

18:04.095 --> 18:22.131
at the time, and he was looking for somebody to take 
the job of farm management.

18:22.151 --> 18:24.553
And, uh, when Mr. Gabbard mentioned it to him, He 
immediately recommended me. Very interesting.

18:30.628 --> 18:42.681
That drastically

18:30.628 --> 18:42.681
altered both your personal and professional 
life, didn't it? Oh, yeah. And this is a very

18:42.921 --> 18:46.905
primitive area when I came here. Yes.

18:50.329 --> 18:53.392
We had a hard time finding a place to live and all 
that sort of stuff. Well, uh-huh. Was it simply

18:57.052 --> 19:05.926
because the area was growing faster than they had, 
they had prepared for, or? Well,

19:06.286 --> 19:12.856
my impression of it was that it hadn't grown fast 
enough. The housing was poor and all that. Yes. And

19:18.805 --> 19:24.013
we had much better housing in South Dakota than we 
had down here. Yes. I never thought about it. I

19:28.441 --> 19:31.905
never know what Alice really thought about it. 
Yes. Did she ever question whether or not you made

19:33.246 --> 19:41.114
the right choice in coming to Texas?

19:43.957 --> 19:47.861
She never questioned anything. I see. Well, one of 
the bright spots of Mrs. Hopkin, my life is getting

19:57.532 --> 20:02.038
to know her. We got to know her through your 
granddaughters, but she was a remarkable woman.

20:11.592 --> 20:24.150
Well, you landed down here, and as I understand it, 
you were very quickly caught up into this research

20:11.592 --> 20:24.150
on type of farming areas. The first thing I did when 
I came here. I

20:27.738 --> 20:34.006
see, that was your first assignment.

20:42.337 --> 20:53.511
And

20:42.337 --> 20:53.511
that was your plan to do that for all of the areas of 
the state? But it never got completed? What

20:58.771 --> 21:00.434
interrupted that?

21:05.582 --> 21:13.414
Well, I don't think any individual or person had 
anything to do with it. I think it was the

21:13.434 --> 21:17.120
circumstances of time. There were too many areas. 
Too many areas. Then the Depression. Yeah, the

21:21.607 --> 21:22.589
Depression hit us. Came along with all of those 
serious problems.

21:29.281 --> 21:34.989
Are you all, well, how, let me not give the answer to 
the question, just pose a question. How did the

21:35.089 --> 21:42.479
Depression hit Texas as compared to, say, other 
areas? Was it as hard down here or harder? Do you

21:48.647 --> 21:50.029
have some feeling on that? I think it's a matter of 
development. I think...

21:59.200 --> 22:19.690
So

21:59.200 --> 22:19.690
that

21:59.200 --> 22:19.690
the

21:59.200 --> 22:19.690
agriculture was just beginning to unfold and 
develop when you really got here in the 20s.

22:37.738 --> 22:48.630
Your research activities at Texas A&M involved 
you very heavily in research on the severe

22:37.738 --> 22:48.630
economic depression which agriculture was 
undergoing during the 20s and all the 30s, through

22:49.420 --> 23:05.178
that whole New Deal farm adjustment programs, 
that were designed, I guess, to help farmers just

22:49.420 --> 23:05.178
survive, wasn't it? Well, I don't know that we 
thought of it in those terms, that some of them were

23:05.338 --> 23:19.073
going to survive anyway, anyhow, any way you did 
it. There was quite a bit of effort at that

23:19.373 --> 23:31.326
time to get people to think in terms of these areas 
and that sort of thing. And the whole institution

23:31.346 --> 23:39.975
was pulled into the Extension Service and the 
Experiment Station. Mr. Connor was director of

23:39.995 --> 23:46.562
the Experiment Station and he didn't

23:49.782 --> 23:53.347
He didn't have a whole lot of interest in it, as I saw 
it. But I attended all meetings with him. And I

23:57.514 --> 24:09.812
guess he was a spokesman for the Experiment

23:57.514 --> 24:09.812
Station. And the young fellow in the Extension 
Service was very much more advanced in his

24:09.832 --> 24:19.266
thinking. Who was this? Do you recall his name? 
Bill Morgan. Bill Morgan? Yes, yes. He went to

24:24.899 --> 24:25.941
Colorado. He went to Colorado as president of 
Colorado State University, didn't he? Mm-hmm. He

24:32.169 --> 24:34.552
was a really young man. Yes.

24:37.917 --> 24:41.221
I was proud to be associated. Mm-hmm. But as you, as 
you, you got caught up into, in this... this

24:50.752 --> 25:06.492
change,

24:50.752 --> 25:06.492
trying to help farmers adjust, and one of the ideas 
was to really follow the type of farming that was

24:50.752 --> 25:06.492
applicable to the area they were in. Was that? Yes. 
Farmer under certain circumstances. Certain

25:17.045 --> 25:19.088
type of land and all that sort of thing. He tried to 
think of his problems as different from the area

25:20.688 --> 25:29.501
next to him. Now, you were kind of the lone social 
scientist in that group, weren't you? Well, Bill

25:35.871 --> 25:39.958
Morgan, you said, was the young extension.

25:42.662 --> 25:48.130
Did you have problems with the physical 
scientists getting them to see the economic

25:42.662 --> 25:48.130
problems?

25:52.058 --> 26:02.931
Well, I don't remember much about that, but I 
thought you meant that we have much trouble with

25:52.058 --> 26:02.931
the extension people and people like that. But

26:04.172 --> 26:16.166
this fellow, Bill Morgan, was a favorite of the 
extension director. And that made it easy to... I

26:17.808 --> 26:18.189
see. Well, that's good. Williamson was a That's 
when Williamson was Director of the Extension

26:23.075 --> 26:25.878
Service. Mr. Connery was Director of the 
Experimental Space. We were all separate at that

26:29.082 --> 26:33.427
time. I think it was 42 when

26:33.447 --> 26:40.916
we crowded into one department. Now, as

26:40.936 --> 26:50.888
you began to address these problems of the 
Depression, there were lots of new agencies

26:51.880 --> 26:54.925
emerged.

26:58.550 --> 27:04.359
Oh, the AAA resettlement.

27:05.461 --> 27:19.542
You were quite heavily involved, were you not, you 
and some of your colleagues, in this AAA work, as I

27:05.461 --> 27:19.542
understand some of the comments of Professor 
Gabbard and and others.

27:24.427 --> 27:43.288
Yes, that's what I understand, but there were some 
real problems of working with the government

27:24.427 --> 27:43.288
people and others in really getting the FIPL-A 
organized, and then learning how to operate it. Do

27:44.389 --> 27:50.035
you recall some of your experiences associated 
with that?

27:50.690 --> 28:11.437
I don't, uh, I think it was, as far as I was 
concerned, it was in the 80's, my, this fella,

27:50.690 --> 28:11.437
Morgan, who was in good favor with the extension 
director. We, uh, we just went right along. Had no

28:16.404 --> 28:19.768
great difficulty. He

28:20.693 --> 28:40.544
was here

28:20.693 --> 28:40.544
during the 30s then, as a young guy. I guess I got to 
meet him just about the time he went to Colorado

28:48.976 --> 28:50.719
State University.

28:53.403 --> 28:55.827
And he was, what, maybe less than 50? Oh, yeah. He 
went up there and he was in his 30s. Was he? Mm-hmm.

29:04.740 --> 29:06.703
Right. Because that would be in the late 40s, when 
he, or about 47 or 8 when he went up there, I expect,

29:06.723 --> 29:16.198
or 46.

29:19.773 --> 29:22.776
But I have no recollection of the time. Do you want 
to go ahead and take the film?

29:27.201 --> 29:46.022
Well, Professor Bonin, we've just been visiting a 
little bit about all of your involvement

29:27.201 --> 29:46.022
when the AAA was initiated along with other 
programs to help farmers during the Depression.

29:48.185 --> 29:49.206
I'd surely appreciate it all you can recollect 
about how this program operated. It began, what,

29:56.133 --> 29:59.177
in 19, about 1933? Now,

29:59.678 --> 30:07.708
how was the university or the experiment station 
involved? It was really the experiment station,

30:07.748 --> 30:10.592
not the university, wasn't it? Well, the 
experiment station, see, at that time it was a

30:11.673 --> 30:16.780
separate organization. And the two of them were 
both involved in this operation.

30:31.444 --> 30:33.247
Who ran that program? Do you recall? Did the 
statewide operation run out of Bryan College

30:35.370 --> 30:44.083
Station? I don't remember. Washington 
background. Yes. And

30:53.498 --> 31:01.569
the two directors were brought in together. And we 
had to get along all right that way. I don't

31:09.440 --> 31:11.944
remember we had any great difficulty. There may 
have been some, but I didn't know any about it. Yes.

31:14.227 --> 31:17.091
Do you recall the important... problems that had 
to be resolved that called for research skills in

31:18.252 --> 31:30.544
agricultural economics and farm management. We 
didn't think of them as being separate problems.

31:34.789 --> 31:35.129
Yes. They were just problems we had to meet at the 
time. You just had to solve problems. What were

31:40.835 --> 31:47.061
some of those

31:40.835 --> 31:47.061
problems as you now recall them?

31:57.065 --> 32:12.211
There

31:57.065 --> 32:12.211
were problems of supply control and marketing 
privileges, I guess, as I recall. How did they

32:14.595 --> 32:17.359
control the marketing of cotton? Did they destroy 
a lot of bales of cotton, or did they simply control

32:17.439 --> 32:23.089
how they marketed it?

32:30.308 --> 32:34.132
I don't recall any actual destruction. Yes. They 
simply cut back on acreage. They tried to.

32:43.480 --> 32:47.724
All they ever cut back on was the acreage that 
didn't produce much anyway. Yes. That's when they

32:50.907 --> 32:52.669
learned how to do that, I guess. They've been doing 
it ever since. Yeah. And it led to... use of more

32:59.131 --> 33:03.097
fertilizer and that sort of thing, so they didn't 
gain much. Production didn't cut back very much.

33:08.826 --> 33:12.893
Now, tell us more about your involvement. Why, 
what did you have to... You mean the AAA effort?

33:18.642 --> 33:23.029
Yes, in that AAA effort.

33:29.405 --> 33:48.797
In the latter part of paragraph six,

33:29.405 --> 33:48.797
you didn't think of this problem being economic or 
whatever it was. I recall

33:49.013 --> 34:09.935
visiting with your son Jim one time about this 
period. He was a young man in the home, a young boy

34:09.975 --> 34:17.923
maybe, but he says he recalls You're getting calls 
in the middle of the night. What would those calls

34:23.200 --> 34:24.682
be about?

34:28.946 --> 34:31.489
I'd say they had these certificates. One of them 
had a certain value. And if they misplaced one of

34:35.113 --> 34:38.436
them, they'd call me. Ask me where it was. Were you 
in charge of issuing those certificates?

34:47.047 --> 34:51.371
or who these were issued, I'm sure, by the AAA 
committees, I suspect. The AAA. I was caught right

34:53.653 --> 34:56.356
in the middle of it. Well,

34:56.676 --> 35:04.083
was this operated from Texas A&M?

35:07.686 --> 35:14.893
Well, we were involved, but I don't know who had the 
final yes or no. Was it located on campus, the

35:15.650 --> 35:22.917
handling of the certificates and all these things 
were moved right on campus? Right on the campus. I

35:24.279 --> 35:24.499
see. So the Extension Service particularly and 
the Experiment Station were intimately involved

35:24.519 --> 35:34.889
in the operation of that program at that time. 
That's right. That's interesting. Do you recall

35:38.653 --> 35:45.420
any kinds of legal problems arose out some of these 
controlled efforts? I don't know whether they

35:50.564 --> 35:57.695
were legal or illegal.

35:57.715 --> 36:02.281
We used to be a man here by the name of Weddington. 
Yes. He was chief clerk in the Extension Service

36:04.525 --> 36:14.559
and a very influential

36:04.525 --> 36:14.559
individual. And as these problems developed, He 
and I became very good friends.

36:22.584 --> 36:28.951
And he was a very upright, very good man.

36:31.714 --> 36:35.879
And he could straighten out things from extension 
supports. I see. Every organization ought to have

36:39.462 --> 36:41.565
somebody like that. Somebody like that. So that 
would be... He was a big man, a big tall fellow.

36:46.290 --> 36:46.390
Yeah. So,

36:48.378 --> 37:03.859
between him on the one hand and Bill Morgan on the 
other, you had a lot of help. That's right. Did you

37:07.203 --> 37:14.332
get to know Sam McMillan in the Extension Service? 
Do you recall him? in farm management. He was very

37:21.211 --> 37:28.239
active in the early development of teaching farm 
management, and then he went with the Extension

37:21.211 --> 37:28.239
Service for a little while. Then finally with the 
Farm Security when they got organized during the

37:28.279 --> 37:35.889
Depression. Uh-huh. Okay.

37:43.698 --> 37:47.663
The name kind of flickers around in my mind,

37:57.616 --> 38:04.286
I

37:57.616 --> 38:04.286
see. In the work that you were doing. Yes.

38:09.393 --> 38:10.134
That's interesting. Well, I suspect we may never 
experience again those new experimental days of

38:12.458 --> 38:24.315
the AAA and the Depression. We probably don't have 
the, we probably don't, first, we may not have the

38:26.017 --> 38:44.902
serious problem arise again that was then, but 
we're probably too constrained by tradition now

38:26.017 --> 38:44.902
to, if we did face those serious problems, to 
experiment as you folks experimented.

38:49.648 --> 38:50.769
I hope they don't. We don't have them. Why do you say 
that?

38:57.455 --> 39:08.209
Well, I guess two or three o'clock calls in the 
morning and that sort of thing wouldn't go so good

38:57.455 --> 39:08.209
now. Yes.

39:18.964 --> 39:26.854
During the 30s, there were many more changes made 
in agricultural policy.

39:30.479 --> 39:36.965
federal programs for agriculture than at any 
other time in our history, probably. Of course, as

39:36.985 --> 39:47.034
you've mentioned, there was some serious 
economic problems emerged all during the 20s.

39:50.798 --> 39:59.406
The kind of research that you were doing, were

39:50.798 --> 39:59.406
you And Mr. Gabbard involved very much in 
providing information that was useful to the

40:00.196 --> 40:21.607
policymakers,

40:00.196 --> 40:21.607
administrators who were making and 
administering farm policy as those policies

40:00.196 --> 40:21.607
emerged in the 30s. Well, that's what we were 
thinking about. Yes. to what extent they

40:30.284 --> 40:39.476
influenced people's thinking,

40:30.284 --> 40:39.476
it would be hard to say. Well, I suspect you're, as 
others have told me, you're a very modest man.

40:49.849 --> 40:58.300
Well,

40:49.849 --> 40:58.300
I never had a feeling of

41:01.165 --> 41:06.633
I never had a feeling of control over these things. 
Yes, well, I can understand that. Yet the kind of

41:10.920 --> 41:28.827
research that you were doing relating to 
identifying the problems associated with farm

41:10.920 --> 41:28.827
management, managing these farms for profit,

41:31.304 --> 41:37.692
likely had a substantial impact on... Well, it may 
have had.

41:48.427 --> 41:51.371
We never felt like we controlled very much.

41:57.859 --> 42:00.703
When you would make these studies in CA, Did you 
work throughout the year? Would you be out in the

42:05.190 --> 42:08.534
state all during the time? You had a field man out in 
there, out in the field. Did you know A.C. McGee?

42:15.742 --> 42:17.264
Yes, I knew A.C. McGee. He was field man for about 
five years out on the High Plains. At Lubbock or

42:21.369 --> 42:23.611
operating out of Lubbock? He operated out of 
Lubbock.

42:29.538 --> 42:31.500
The High Plains area included... the cotton 
producing part of the pipelines. And he lived in

42:36.965 --> 42:50.860
Lubbock and had,

42:36.965 --> 42:50.860
I don't know, maybe 50 farmers that worked with 
him. And he visited them regularly. He visited

42:52.562 --> 42:57.327
them regularly and got details of the operation. 
Farm costs. Did they sort of keep They kept

43:02.159 --> 43:02.820
records. Kept detailed records for him. They used 
a simple form of record book that I designed for the

43:05.843 --> 43:15.053
state of Texas.

43:21.640 --> 43:28.768
That's about all I remember,

43:21.640 --> 43:28.768
but he was a good man on detail. Yes.

43:34.340 --> 43:39.446
We depended on him as our contact. The idea, when we 
first made this type of farming study, the idea was

43:39.466 --> 43:56.787
that eventually we would get around to all the 
areas, which turned out to be impossible. But we

43:56.807 --> 44:04.296
did get to, I guess, four or five of them.

44:10.739 --> 44:13.442
Plans are always bigger than your output. Well, 
that's appropriate, I'm sure. We all have to plan

44:15.765 --> 44:23.735
too big and then strain ourselves to get all of it we 
can. During

44:23.795 --> 44:36.030
that particular time, of course, your research 
unit was totally separated from the teaching. Did

44:37.472 --> 44:40.155
you ever have any graduate students that worked 
for you on their dissertations or their thesis?

44:47.925 --> 44:47.985
No. They didn't? Those were never, never were 
related together. That's... That was until 1942.

44:56.816 --> 44:57.097
Yes. What's it mean? Gilchrist became president, 
nodded two heads around and brought everything

45:01.322 --> 45:08.392
together. Yes. And I say, knock their heads 
around. Yes. Some of them had to be hit a little hard

45:13.137 --> 45:16.261
to do that. You know, I never saw as much difference 
in a man who went from in charge of the whole

45:16.281 --> 45:24.853
institution. See, he was the, what do you call him? 
Chancellor? The president? Chancellor, I guess.

45:33.344 --> 45:34.666
Chancellor, yeah. He could knock anybody's head 
around. Yes. And... Later on, after he retired,

45:39.687 --> 45:52.524
while he was chancellor, I couldn't even give a 
word.

45:52.544 --> 45:58.873
But after he retired, I walked a good deal, and he 
did too. And I'd run into

45:58.893 --> 46:08.065
him out here in South Kansas or something. And I 
couldn't hardly get away from him. And he would

46:09.146 --> 46:09.627
talk to me. That's interesting. Showed what kind 
of man he was. Yes. He concentrated on his job.

46:18.404 --> 46:21.248
Well, he was too big. Yes.

46:27.655 --> 46:39.630
Well, how did the problems change for you and in 
your research as we moved toward the end of the 30s?

46:41.180 --> 46:54.034
into 1940 and 41, and war preparations came on us in 
about 1940 and 41, and then the end of 41 we were in

46:41.180 --> 46:54.034
World War II.

46:57.157 --> 46:59.099
What happened to your programs then? Did this 
change your research program very much?

47:08.630 --> 47:10.832
Well, it didn't change our thinking about it. not 
the program we had, we still have in mind,

47:11.150 --> 47:29.047
after we had developed these type farming areas, 
making individual studies in each area. Of

47:29.067 --> 47:33.251
course, that never happened except in four or five 
areas.

47:37.976 --> 47:39.958
But during the war, Was there, were you and the 
Extension Service as well as the Experiment

47:41.120 --> 47:48.109
Station
