00:03.170 --> 00:06.434
Where did that recipe come from? When did it 
originate? And how many of those rolls were made a

00:10.600 --> 00:15.507
week or a day? Well, I'd like to take credit for 
that, but I can't. That roll was being produced

00:19.472 --> 00:24.439
when I came here. And it's a fully approved roll, as 
you know. It won't keep very well due to that

00:28.424 --> 00:32.670
because it's a fluffy, soft roll. But that was used 
only at the Memorial Student Center. We used a

00:37.280 --> 00:41.905
little different role for the remainder of the 
campus. But that's a famous role even today. So it

00:45.428 --> 00:48.071
started with the MSC, maybe? Perhaps it did. I do 
not know. I wish I'd asked at the time who

00:50.694 --> 00:55.659
originated that role, and someday I may find out. 
If I do, I'll come back and tell you. When my wife and

00:58.520 --> 01:04.928
I moved to El Paso, somebody gave us a recipe. Well, 
I sent you a recipe, but it seems like it's

01:04.948 --> 01:09.814
difficult to duplicate. It was. In another area 
for some reason. It's like trying to eat lobster

01:13.319 --> 01:17.824
here or pinto beans in Maine. They just aren't the 
same. That's right. What were other favorite

01:20.668 --> 01:24.072
dishes or specialties down through the years? 
Well, one of the main ones that I recall was the

01:26.580 --> 01:31.406
Aggie fritter. And the Aggie fritter was nothing 
more. It was served often at breakfast and was a

01:35.752 --> 01:40.298
favorite item. It was two pieces of bread that was 
stuck together with apricot jam and refrigerated

01:49.195 --> 01:51.497
overnight. This toast then, these two slices of 
bread were cut diagonally, dipped in a batter

01:51.738 --> 02:07.935
similar to a hot cake batter, deep fat fried, and 
then sprinkled with sugar as they came out of the

01:51.738 --> 02:07.935
hot fat. That was one of the most popular items. I 
gave that to Luby's once when I started their

02:11.559 --> 02:14.882
breakfast. And it was so popular here, this 
manager said, well, I wish the managers didn't

02:15.098 --> 02:24.350
want to call it Aggie Roll in the other parts of the 
country. I told them to use it. They had to call it

02:25.271 --> 02:27.674
that because that's what it is. So that was about 
the old items. Some of the strange items and

02:31.139 --> 02:38.068
unusual things we had here because A&M had been 
here so long. and had purchased so much compared to

02:38.977 --> 02:42.080
other universities. One of the items you'd run 
into some strange thing. I noticed the item on our

02:46.846 --> 02:54.174
bid list, it said A&M Hounds, A&M Hounds. An A&M 
Hound is not ham at all. An A&M Hound was a baby beef

02:58.599 --> 03:06.688
leg set with a leg in the round. And that became 
known as an A&M ham set. So those are just some of the

03:13.612 --> 03:19.718
things that... Who were... Describe for me the 
purchasing process, the procurement process for

03:19.858 --> 03:27.686
all of the food service supplies. Well, we had 
competitive bids when I came in. But that had been

03:33.955 --> 03:45.106
one of my specialties in the military, so we 
expanded that some and began to develop some

03:33.955 --> 03:45.106
specifications we didn't have. And we began to buy 
as much as we could store with intensive

03:46.006 --> 03:55.816
competitive bidding. And we would do this in the 
production seasons, packing seasons, as much as

03:55.836 --> 04:02.342
we could. And then if we heard of distressed 
merchandise, that is overproduction of ketchup

04:02.997 --> 04:12.550
or peaches or whatever it was, we would take more 
bids. And each year, one of the things we started

04:14.092 --> 04:21.242
was to get samples in from all these companies that 
bid. We'd have a counter maybe 100 feet long or more

04:21.262 --> 04:25.648
of different foods. And we'd start comparing, and 
we would weigh every item that we were going to

04:32.056 --> 04:45.931
purchase that was weighable to determine the 
lowest cost per ounce of the product inside

04:32.056 --> 04:45.931
without juice or additives or anything. And so we 
were very successful in getting some very

04:45.951 --> 04:49.855
inexpensive items. I had one occasion to compare 
that with one of the main chain cafeteria

04:49.875 --> 05:01.067
operators who believed he could buy off from as he 
needed as cheap as we could. So we compared figures

05:01.520 --> 05:11.212
one day, and we were paying about an average of 30% 
less than he was. He said, I give up. And he was a very

05:13.374 --> 05:17.599
wealthy, successful operator. And then that's 
one of the reasons we built. One of the last things

05:21.384 --> 05:28.152
that I had anything to do with was our food service 
commissary on the west side of campus. And the

05:28.172 --> 05:30.835
nearest we could figure, the first year we We built 
that because we had supplies scattered all over

05:31.507 --> 05:36.334
campus. We estimated that we saved approximately 
one half million dollars that year. Now you stored

05:42.863 --> 05:46.087
in it canned and frozen? Canned and frozen, yes. A 
year's supply of cans primarily and of course the

05:48.851 --> 05:59.826
frozen would vary anywhere from 30, 60 to 90 days. 
because we've tried to get as large of lots as we

06:00.211 --> 06:05.196
could. And it has been successful to the best of my 
knowledge and belief. I was there about two or

06:11.142 --> 06:15.287
three years before I retired. Did you ever buy 
bulk, dry vegetables, beans, corn, anything like

06:15.928 --> 06:25.898
that? Not, not, not, not, we bought dry ones. Yes, 
we bought like, you know, pintos and black-eyed

06:29.886 --> 06:33.093
peas. Yes, we'd do that stuff. One time I happened 
to be walking through and there was a little bit of

06:35.919 --> 06:40.849
bidding. and I think it was bacon, and I think they 
were tenths of cents, 21 point something

06:41.200 --> 06:49.751
something cents per pound. It's fractions of a 
hundredth of a cent. Is that right? Yeah. Is that

06:52.494 --> 06:53.696
right? Yeah. Can you give me, give us some examples 
of the quantity per year you might have bought of

06:54.517 --> 07:02.807
anything? Well, we'd buy 40 to 60,000 pounds of 
canned corn. Per year? Per year. 40 to 60,000

07:13.369 --> 07:16.632
pounds of green beans. Nearly everything was 
based on a body. And we, as I recall, we were using

07:20.115 --> 07:27.542
about a carload lot, which is up to 60,000 pounds of 
many of our basic items. And sometimes it would be a

07:28.663 --> 07:37.432
carload, but we would vary the amount of the car 
that would come in. Because that saved,

07:37.452 --> 07:41.616
obviously, money on packing and shipping and 
such. That was one of the things that we took

07:42.220 --> 07:46.984
advantage of in the carload lots. And those 
materials would arrive by railroad or by truck?

07:52.409 --> 07:59.276
When I speak of carloads, I'm talking of rail. And 
we had a lot of rail shipments, more than I think

08:00.117 --> 08:04.080
they have now. But then later on, it began to 
develop a lot of wood come by truck. Sometimes it's

08:09.440 --> 08:11.362
in a couple of trucks. Sometimes it'd be a 
truckload. Normally, we could buy for less money

08:13.845 --> 08:19.172
with the rail car. But that changes a little over 
periods of time. Where else in this part of the

08:25.680 --> 08:32.908
country was there another operation of this 
magnitude other than in the military? Well, Texas

08:33.489 --> 08:36.873
Tech had a similar operation. Not as big. We 
were... about, we were one of the largest in

08:39.848 --> 08:48.657
America for institutional feet in one location. 
Texas Tech was big. The next one of any size would

08:50.518 --> 08:59.127
have been Michigan State, Ohio State, University 
of Illinois. But beyond that, they were small by

08:59.788 --> 09:04.472
comparison. So we couldn't We couldn't work much 
with them, with others, except for those, to

09:06.173 --> 09:16.097
compare notes of things we did. And we did that as 
much as possible. We had an organization, which

09:18.082 --> 09:23.355
was National Association of College and 
University Food Services. And I told some of them

09:23.909 --> 09:33.701
one day, I said, we have to stay close together 
because our food, us food service people are

09:23.909 --> 09:33.701
always on the bottom of the totem pole. To which 
they agreed. Now, and so food service here was

09:34.702 --> 09:39.849
entirely self-supporting. Entirely. And that 
not only meant daily operations, but additions,

09:44.935 --> 09:48.479
renovations, improvements, and so forth. Yes, 
that's right. Take me through, in the nine-month

09:51.323 --> 10:01.615
term school year, take me through a typical week of 
your schedule. Well, it's almost a blur because

10:01.635 --> 10:11.027
one of the jokes I used to, an ironical joke I guess 
you'd call it, I had a heart attack on one occasion,

10:11.530 --> 10:17.477
I'd been working about 16 hours a day, and Dr. O.C. 
Cooper says, you've got to take a half a day off. So I

10:20.640 --> 10:33.534
told everybody, which is true really, I cut it from 
16 to 12 to 13, because I could never feel that I

10:20.640 --> 10:33.534
accomplished a job on the list. Now maybe if I'd 
been more intelligent I could have, but I

10:33.595 --> 10:38.500
couldn't. We'd start out early in the morning. I'd 
get up early in the morning, every morning. I got up

10:43.685 --> 10:45.027
early in the morning. If we were building 
something, like a renovation or a new building, I

10:45.047 --> 10:52.356
might wake up at 3 o'clock. If I did, I'd get up and 
come to work. But, ordinarily, I'd come in about 7

10:55.360 --> 11:04.892
o'clock, sometimes 6.30, and try to visit two or 
three places because my routine was to try to visit

11:05.547 --> 11:12.674
every place at least once a day. And sometimes you 
can't do that, but this was the schedule anyway.

11:19.121 --> 11:26.588
And there's always a bunch of paperwork for 
something when you have, as you know, a big number

11:19.121 --> 11:26.588
of employees. So you get into that a little bit, and 
once you get a little bit drowsy or tired of that,

11:32.682 --> 11:38.431
Then you've got to go out and see who's missing 
where. And not because you have to do it

11:38.451 --> 11:59.145
personally, because it's good to, by that time the 
managers would be in gear, and I would simply want

11:38.451 --> 11:59.145
to ask them how they were doing, and how things were 
coming along, and if I could be of any help to them.

11:59.682 --> 12:05.309
Then we'd come along for lunchtime, and I'd want to 
see some of the guests at different places. If it

12:05.409 --> 12:13.199
was students, or if it was people, I'd want to 
circulate among them and see if everything was all

12:05.409 --> 12:13.199
right. And then in the afternoon, we'd get back to 
the paperwork again. And there's always plenty of

12:17.865 --> 12:20.269
paperwork. And sometimes there'd be a question. 
Not very often they'd come in from Howard or Mr.

12:22.011 --> 12:25.335
Cherry. But that wasn't any problem, really, 
because they were trying to support. They were not

12:32.205 --> 12:34.528
trying to interfere with anything. And then by the 
time the evening meal came along, it was time to

12:34.548 --> 12:45.961
take another look at your customers and the menu, 
to check the menus. We did this each time to see if

12:46.341 --> 12:53.449
the menu that we prescribed ahead of time was being 
followed. And if so, what quality was. So I tasted a

12:57.251 --> 13:09.565
lot of items that, you know, that really got to be a 
chore because you'd taste items so much you'd

12:57.251 --> 13:09.565
interfere with your meal. I've tasted enough 
items so that some days I wouldn't eat at all or eat

13:10.646 --> 13:16.893
on the run and never sat down to eat a meal. Just keep 
tasting maybe something that went wrong. Then in

13:21.644 --> 13:45.205
the evening, if we had a banquet, particularly, or 
a formal affair, and we had these, really, in

13:21.644 --> 13:45.205
Sebiza and in Duncan and in the Memorial Student 
Center, I would want to see what was happening,

13:21.644 --> 13:45.205
even though we had competent managers, just to be 
there, because I found it was very important just

13:46.788 --> 13:53.294
to be available so that questions came up, they 
could get an answer immediately. I didn't have to

13:53.675 --> 13:56.537
wait and wonder where I was. If anybody was unhappy 
about anything, that is a customer, I could say,

13:56.577 --> 14:03.024
well, I was there. And I didn't know it, or I did know 
it, and I did this and so. So that's the reason the

14:10.611 --> 14:13.233
hours were quite long. So you'd get here By 7. About 
7 o'clock. And you'd leave? Anywhere from, really

14:21.003 --> 14:26.729
anywhere from 7 to 10 or 10 o'clock. All right, 
let's make it then a football Saturday. What was

14:29.792 --> 14:31.974
Saturday like? That was a long, that was extra long 
because I used to tell people anytime we had a

14:31.994 --> 14:39.762
football game, A big day before, everybody was 
woozy the next day, which was pretty well true

14:40.940 --> 14:52.074
because everybody did everything they could 
possibly do to be sure it was done right. And you'd

14:52.415 --> 14:55.679
have to shift people and equipment. We would have a 
meeting each Friday. I started a meeting each of

14:57.301 --> 15:09.276
our managers each Friday so that if we had a banquet 
one place, we'd have to shift equipment over to

14:57.301 --> 15:09.276
another and shift personnel as well. And we had to 
do this methodically and pretty accurately in

15:10.370 --> 15:17.660
order to survive. And I'm sure they're doing that 
today. What were the most popular dishes, be they

15:22.627 --> 15:28.935
desserts or main courses or what, that you recall? 
We mentioned the rolls, but... Well, the rolls are

15:29.405 --> 15:32.169
good. Always a steak was popular. We started out, 
when I came here, serving a 12-ounce steak, and at

15:35.534 --> 15:43.286
14, that would be ridiculous now, down to 6 and 8 
ounces. But the steak was always very popular.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.437
Lobster Troubadour, very popular. Lobster 
Newberg. And the shrimp fries we had were real

15:53.341 --> 15:57.808
popular items, whereas the pluck them off like 
peanuts, the big, big shrimp. And Mr. Howard liked

16:01.167 --> 16:03.669
those particularly well. And of course the big 
rounds of roast beef were always a popular item.

16:11.036 --> 16:16.261
Now they're more popular then than they are now 
because people eat lighter today. And then we had a

16:17.262 --> 16:21.606
lot of desserts that were more popular. Things 
like certainly the chocolate pies and pecan pies

16:22.447 --> 16:27.492
and the coconuts that people liked the recipes a 
little better, and they were quite popular as

16:28.079 --> 16:35.490
well. And then we had, I remember, always for the 
football games for a long period there, we would

16:35.510 --> 16:47.428
serve and call it Aggie cake, which is a maroon 
colored red velvet cake. And we'd have that lined

16:47.448 --> 16:50.653
up with the white icing on it. That'd always been 
popular because People bought it because it was

16:52.615 --> 16:56.899
maroon. Maroon and white. Did President and Mrs. 
Rutter have any favorites, particularly? Well,

17:02.644 --> 17:06.848
President Rutter's favorite was just food. He 
liked all food. I recall one occasion when I'd

17:10.031 --> 17:13.834
serve teriyaki. I brought this recipe from the 
east. He thought that was great, and we were having

17:17.638 --> 17:20.040
it. President's Buffet, and he was sitting in the 
back, and I think that day he was eating with

17:20.527 --> 17:26.715
Governor Smith or somebody. But he got up from his 
table, and I was at one end of the room, and he was the

17:27.456 --> 17:35.606
other, and he said, Hey, Dollar, what is this?

17:38.330 --> 17:41.754
I hollered back and told him. Were there any that 
either of the rudders didn't like? that you knew to

17:45.063 --> 17:46.364
leave them? No, not really. No, they had no 
hang-ups. They seemed to be prone to roast beef a

17:51.130 --> 17:55.314
lot. Ms. Runner liked to always have that on hand. 
But they were really easy to, very particular, but

17:59.018 --> 18:05.986
still easy to satisfy. All right, let's go then to 
the Williams. Did they have any special

18:07.447 --> 18:10.190
enjoyments? Well, yes, they... They were a little 
more particular and wanted certain things and

18:12.046 --> 18:19.056
didn't go for the heavy food as much. And of course 
then the Vandiver's were not too much on the heavy

18:20.458 --> 18:25.845
food. Then Dr. Miller, when Dr. Miller was here, he 
was back to the type of President Rudder. He liked

18:31.954 --> 18:38.263
to eat and eat well and have it in the old fashioned, 
old fashioned manner. So of course we tried to

18:38.323 --> 18:41.327
please everybody. All right, now this next 
question has pluses and minuses. Sure. You must

18:45.518 --> 18:56.054
remember some notable successes, and there must 
have been at least one or two incidents when

18:45.518 --> 18:56.054
something didn't work out the way you'd planned 
it. Yeah, well, I think the most embarrassing

18:56.074 --> 19:03.506
thing that ever happened to me, fortunately there 
wasn't a lot of them. I always envisioned the fact

19:03.526 --> 19:08.634
that if we forgot a banquet scheduled or 
something. We never did. But that always was a

19:10.653 --> 19:13.878
harassment in the back of my mind. But on one 
occasion, we had the knife and fork club up there.

19:19.246 --> 19:25.255
And the chicken cordon bleu had just come out, so 
they decided that was the menu. And so we said,

19:25.656 --> 19:27.258
okay. And it had always been turned out, and it 
always turned out very pretty, and we knew just how

19:27.318 --> 19:33.007
to do it. We had a chef had been doing it for years. Lo 
and behold, that product, looked well on the

19:40.268 --> 19:44.194
plate, but it wasn't cooked. That was the most 
embarrassing thing that ever happened to me. So

19:49.681 --> 19:51.324
this was raw chicken? Well, it was partially raw at 
any rate. But, you know, none of it did not seem to

19:55.790 --> 20:01.939
bother any of them very much. But the irony, the 
peculiar part about this is It seemed like always

20:08.855 --> 20:13.199
the things I thought were going to give me the most 
trouble didn't. It was always the unexpected that

20:13.680 --> 20:20.146
gave me the great problems. Of course, I guess 
that's true everywhere, but it had never been true

20:20.987 --> 20:27.573
on the other jobs I'd had as much as this one. Among 
the groups, what's about some of the largest meals

20:28.154 --> 20:37.343
that you remember having to prepare for? Oh, I 
believe

20:39.770 --> 20:48.563
maybe 1,500 at a time, which is not too many. That 
would have been in Duncan? In Duncan, and

20:51.867 --> 20:58.757
sometimes in Sabeza we'd have that many. uh as a but 
not seated at one one time now actually sabiza will

20:59.564 --> 21:26.702
seat where would it then uh maximum seating 4200 
whole target that seated doesn't really uh that's

20:59.564 --> 21:26.702
a wall-to-wall family style and duncan would seat 
3 800. he fed that many during the second world war

20:59.564 --> 21:26.702
when the navy and marines were here training I 
talked to him once. I used to have him out as often as

21:28.740 --> 21:32.405
I could before he passed away. Let's go back and 
capture him. Describe him physically and his

21:35.850 --> 21:42.018
manner and style of leadership. Well, he was tall, 
very well-dressed, well-mannered individual,

21:42.238 --> 21:51.791
well-educated man. And he was fairly formal in his 
conduct. with everybody and and really easy to

21:56.635 --> 22:24.651
interpret misinterpret because he was had a 
little bit of a harsh side but he had really a heart

21:56.635 --> 22:24.651
of gold he's one of those people that wanted things 
exactly right but he would anybody's trying he

21:56.635 --> 22:24.651
would support them to the last but if unless it was 
it unless they were violating his opinion and that

21:56.635 --> 22:24.651
would infuriate him greatly And there's some 
instances that some of his other people related to

22:24.968 --> 22:30.976
him, and I could see that as we went along. But if he 
thought he could do something for you, he would do

22:31.697 --> 22:35.983
that. But he gave very clear instructions, and he 
did not give real close supervision. As a matter of

22:42.953 --> 22:50.824
fact, he had the reputation of getting bored with 
the job after he'd been around too long for a while.

22:51.645 --> 22:53.828
But he knew... How to operate. As you may know, he 
was hired out of here by White's Cafeterias at a

22:56.483 --> 23:12.425
then tremendous salary, $25,000 a year, which is 
about the same as the governor of the state made,

22:56.483 --> 23:12.425
and higher than anybody else made anywhere. So we 
were just amazed at his reputation. He had a

23:17.913 --> 23:19.415
tremendous reputation. Now, he was here about how 
long? I don't know how many years he was here. He

23:23.750 --> 23:27.012
came from New Orleans, I believe. I was going to say 
you and he and Bernard Sabisa together. For a long

23:32.317 --> 23:34.098
time. Bernard Sabisa was a good director 50 years. 
I was going to say the three of you, about

23:37.641 --> 23:44.807
three-fourths, two-thirds, three-fourths of 
the existence. Of the whole time. Because Mr.

23:45.808 --> 23:48.731
Holtard was here 15 years or something? I think so, 
but I'm not too certain about that. uh i was a

23:51.925 --> 24:20.667
seventh director by the way we had general b he was 
the first then sabiza then mr duncan and mr hotard

23:51.925 --> 24:20.667
and then frank nuget i believe and then me who'd i 
leave out of there somebody i think at least

23:51.925 --> 24:20.667
there's someone we had to i'll redo that b sabiza 
duncan hotard penniston penniston and news news

23:51.925 --> 24:20.667
jay penniston was hotard brother-in-law Oh, I 
didn't know. He had run the meat market. Okay. We

24:25.214 --> 24:27.376
had a central butcher shop, by the way. You 
mentioned we didn't cook it there. By the way, what

24:30.179 --> 24:40.030
they do now, and before I left here, we started 
cooking a lot centrally, the meat roast and the

24:30.179 --> 24:40.030
hamburgers. As a matter of fact, we have a great 
ground meat operation there. We use chucks

24:46.597 --> 24:48.519
primarily. I think they still do. And, uh, under 
real sanitary conditions. And it's packaged and

24:55.470 --> 25:01.096
been sent out to the, uh, dormitory, uh, to the mess 
hall. During your, your days, did we ever have any

25:01.497 --> 25:08.784
breakdown of quality control and people get sick? 
And did we ever have an outbreak of anything? We

25:11.728 --> 25:16.793
didn't have any big outbreaks, but we, we had a, we 
had a few where, where, uh, But nothing was ever

25:17.380 --> 25:23.909
identified as having caused it. And what I did, 
when we suspected something, I'd get the food

25:23.949 --> 25:39.851
sanitarium here on campus to look at it and arrange 
for any tests that needed to be done. So we

25:40.812 --> 25:43.135
precluded most of that. Actually, there's seldom 
really any chance for that if your sanitation is

25:43.469 --> 25:50.678
good enough. Now, I know there's always a chance 
for anything, but we were very blessed to not have

25:50.698 --> 26:00.730
any serious things developed. Let's make believe 
there's going to be a big dinner on Saturday. The

26:08.040 --> 26:09.241
president's going to host it. We've got a number of 
dignitaries coming. who would select the menu and

26:11.903 --> 26:17.749
how far in advance would you need to start planning 
it? Well, of course, we would coordinate with the,

26:19.130 --> 26:32.264
or vice versa, with the president's secretary or 
assistant to work out the basic menu. If it's a

26:32.284 --> 26:34.606
buffet, we had free reign. But if it's a seated 
affair, it would be different. So that would

26:38.785 --> 26:45.071
usually happen and should happen maybe a week or 
two in advance, just traditionally. Not

26:45.171 --> 26:46.272
necessarily so. We could do that within 48 hours 
easy enough. But was it routine only a week in

26:49.976 --> 26:55.682
advance for you and your staff to sit down? About 
that. That was sort of routine, not essential. But

26:59.806 --> 27:08.775
we would have an idea about the number, and we would 
keep talking almost daily with whoever we worked

26:59.806 --> 27:08.775
with in the president's office. about the numbers 
or any peculiarities or menu preferences such as

27:09.110 --> 27:25.311
could they eat meats or did they want fish instead 
of steak or vegetables instead of regular meal.

27:25.331 --> 27:31.759
And so if you worked closely enough and worked on it 
enough, things always went well but it was always a

27:32.600 --> 27:57.342
matter of intense effort and I we always did that to 
my knowledge to try to get them right now and that

27:32.600 --> 27:57.342
doesn't mean they were all they weren't perfect 
but they were they were acceptable you might say

27:32.600 --> 27:57.342
all right so you would with uh when NELDA Rowell, 
now Nelda Green, was the secretary. You would work

28:00.941 --> 28:02.725
primarily with her? Normally with Ed Cooper. With 
Ed Cooper, okay. All right, now let's make believe

28:05.309 --> 28:15.128
that you have some new idea, some new dish that has 
never been tried before. were the presidents

28:15.698 --> 28:22.068
susceptible to those, to trying them? Well, I 
wouldn't want to do that on a big affair. Oh, okay. I

28:26.635 --> 28:28.938
wouldn't mind serving him personally. Oh, okay. 
On one occasion, I came up with a concoction for the

28:30.360 --> 28:40.576
Board of Regents a few years ago over here, and I 
called it Egg's Regency. It was an egg, nothing

28:40.616 --> 28:44.862
more than one had been... scrambled and shaped 
with a sauce of breakfast on them. So Mr.

28:51.742 --> 29:04.018
Weizenbaker came in and who was a difficult with 
some people, but Mr. Burkhardt said, how would you

28:51.742 --> 29:04.018
like to try our egg Regency? He said, oh yeah, I'll 
try that. But he said, leave that old sauce off.

29:07.663 --> 29:08.825
Well, that was the whole thing.

29:11.849 --> 29:14.292
As the board members would come in that morning, 
Mr. Burkhart kept laughing about it. Mr. Burkhart

29:17.379 --> 29:24.971
would say, don't treat that egg green, see. But, 
you see, most of the people, as you know, you've

29:24.991 --> 29:31.020
been at that level. When you reach that level, it's 
just like the generals in the Army. The easiest

29:34.104 --> 29:40.254
people to talk with and to get along with, as long as 
you're trying, are the people on top. Mm-hmm. And,

29:41.069 --> 29:48.422
of course, if you do something to negligence, 
that's a different story. But that's the thing

29:49.343 --> 29:53.851
that always bothered me, that we would foul up. And 
I guess that's maybe the reason the Lord blessed me

29:54.131 --> 29:57.878
when I didn't. All right. Let's go back now to you 
reported Howard Vestal. and Mr. Cherry, give me an

30:04.255 --> 30:16.266
example of Mr. Cherry's decision-making style, 
some important decision that he made that

30:04.255 --> 30:16.266
affected you and food service. Well, there were a 
lot of them. I made notes on everything but that.

30:22.572 --> 30:31.180
But he would make the decisions, I'd say almost the 
final decision, except Mr. and Mr. Rudder, if it

30:31.200 --> 30:33.182
was big enough, would get in on it. on anything we 
were to build, for example.

30:39.794 --> 30:56.492
If we had a new building of some type, that would be 
of concern to him in the sense that he wouldn't know

30:39.794 --> 30:56.492
why we were doing it and where we were going to put it 
and what it would cost and if we had the money and

30:39.794 --> 30:56.492
that sort of thing. And if it sounded good to him, 
He's like Howard Bestel said once, and I'll

31:00.787 --> 31:06.554
interrupt this to say this. He said, let's don't 
take Mr. Cherry, the small problems, let's take

31:07.255 --> 31:14.964
him the big ones. Because he had a method of 
handling the biggest problems, the easiest of any

31:15.504 --> 31:22.372
man I have ever seen. I have never seen a man that was 
as calm and deliberate and seems to be as active as

31:27.652 --> 31:33.983
he was on nearly everything.
