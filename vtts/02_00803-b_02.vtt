WEBVTT

00:03.524 --> 00:05.427
I can give you many examples of that. Venezuelan 
equine encephalomyelitis

00:07.790 --> 00:14.380
entered the state of Texas in July of 1971. We had no 
expertise in that disease. I see. Whole cholera

00:20.568 --> 00:25.696
entered Texas in that same year from Mexico. Whole 
cholera is now a foreign animal disease. Exotic

00:30.237 --> 00:35.304
Newcastle disease has been diagnosed in Texas in 
poultry.

00:38.848 --> 00:39.509
Screw worms. Some of these diseases are not 
necessarily tropical diseases, but diseases

00:42.032 --> 00:56.751
that are foreign to this country and diseases in 
which a tremendous expertise should be developed

00:42.032 --> 00:56.751
in order to cope with them Before they hit, not 
after. We were caught with our pants down when VWE

00:59.412 --> 01:03.921
hit Texas. Which is what, VWE? Venezuelan equine 
cephalomyelitis. And if it hadn't been for the

01:09.391 --> 01:17.727
vaccine that had been developed by the Army at Fort 
Detrick, we would have been up the proverbial

01:09.391 --> 01:17.727
creek.

01:20.474 --> 01:31.187
So, in your opinion then, would you say, and I don't 
want to put words in your mouth, but would you say

01:20.474 --> 01:31.187
that this college and their research seems to be 
short-sighted? Well, Dr. Anderson, I think the

01:33.089 --> 01:50.110
reason- Or just too narrow and- No, the reason why 
the research isn't broader than it is is I think

01:51.743 --> 02:03.443
because all

01:51.743 --> 02:03.443
animal disease research now, practically all 
animal disease research is controlled through

01:51.743 --> 02:03.443
the Experiment Station. I think it should be the 
responsibility of the College of Veterinary

02:03.463 --> 02:11.878
Medicine to do animal disease research.

02:14.542 --> 02:22.291
The expertise for animal disease research 
resides in the College of Animal Medicine, not in

02:14.542 --> 02:22.291
the Experiment Station.

02:25.275 --> 02:40.093
And the

02:25.275 --> 02:40.093
present setup, whereby the director of the 
Experiment Station controlled the monies to fund

02:25.275 --> 02:40.093
animal disease research, I don't think is 
advantageous for the College of Veterinary

02:40.900 --> 02:45.606
Medicine. This is a political, infrastructural 
policy over which I exercise absolutely no say.

02:58.904 --> 03:10.620
But in my opinion, the College of Veterinary 
Medicine should be the sole agent for the

02:58.904 --> 03:10.620
university system in matters pertaining to 
animal disease research. This is not to say that

03:12.372 --> 03:23.985
some research should not be done collaboratively 
with the departments of animal science,

03:12.372 --> 03:23.985
entomology, or any other department. For 
example, in fish culture, mariculture study, we

03:25.808 --> 03:37.401
ought to cooperate with other departments on this 
campus in... in bringing the best minds of the

03:37.972 --> 03:43.962
university system to bear upon a problem. That's 
my opinion. In other words, it seems that we need

03:45.485 --> 03:50.994
more cooperation and coordination of our 
research efforts? I think that one of the things

03:51.455 --> 04:02.393
that is necessary is that the College of 
Veterinary Medicine be given

03:51.455 --> 04:02.393
more autonomy.

04:05.107 --> 04:16.043
There is no reason in the world why a research 
project that is written by a veterinary

04:05.107 --> 04:16.043
researcher ought to be approved by the experiment 
station. I think that's absurd. It should be

04:18.746 --> 04:23.133
approved by the dean here and then by the president 
of the university.

04:25.696 --> 04:33.848
I don't see any reason why we should respond to an 
intermediate agency that has no expertise in

04:34.840 --> 04:39.606
animal health, except the director. And the 
director is a veterinarian who had never

04:39.626 --> 04:45.494
functioned as a veterinarian for the last 20 years 
of his life. He's been an administrator.

04:51.662 --> 04:58.091
But you see, he used to be associate dean for 
research here before his promotion. But in my

04:58.111 --> 05:03.278
opinion, there isn't the fluidity of 
administrative matters

05:05.232 --> 05:31.070
that should circulate between this college and 
the Office of International Programs, for

05:05.232 --> 05:31.070
example, I think there should be more intimate 
contact between the Office of International

05:05.232 --> 05:31.070
Programs and the College of Veterinary Medicine 
in matters pertaining to animal health. I'm not

05:32.192 --> 05:33.113
talking about academic matters. I'm not talking 
about the possible recruitment of foreign

05:36.425 --> 05:44.576
students to the College of Veterinary Medicine. 
That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking

05:46.579 --> 06:01.800
about capitalizing on opportunities that exist 
abroad for the research of animal diseases that

05:46.579 --> 06:01.800
could possibly threaten the welfare of this state 
and of this country. Let me give you an example.

06:08.221 --> 06:13.968
African swine fever is a deadly disease of swine 
for which there is no vaccine. Traditionally,

06:15.910 --> 06:26.884
African swine fever has been limited to Africa and 
to Spain and Portugal and other countries in that

06:15.910 --> 06:26.884
area of the world. But in 1978, this disease broke 
out in Brazil. From Brazil, it has spread to

06:32.965 --> 06:38.631
Dominican Republic, it has spread to Haiti, and 
it's now in Cuba. And it is too close for comfort. If

06:42.555 --> 06:48.242
it hits the United States, and I am convinced that 
it will enter the United States. I don't know when,

06:49.483 --> 06:53.647
but I think it will hit this country. And I think 
that this College of Veterinary Medicine ought to

06:54.088 --> 07:01.656
be readying for the time when this disease is going 
to hit our shores. And right now, there has been,

07:07.392 --> 07:16.141
for the last few years, a limitation of funds from 
the federal government for animal disease

07:07.392 --> 07:16.141
research. But what little monies there have come 
to the university, they have gone to the

07:17.122 --> 07:23.007
experiment station. Of course, the director of 
the experiment station has complete latitude to

07:23.027 --> 07:31.896
determine where that money should go. What agency 
in the country would be working on this African?

07:38.052 --> 08:01.579
Well, right now, for example, to answer your 
question, the United States Department of

07:38.052 --> 08:01.579
Agriculture is cooperating with the Food and 
Agricultural Organization of the United Nations

07:38.052 --> 08:01.579
to fund a team of people

07:38.052 --> 08:01.579
that is established in Santo Domingo, the 
Dominican Republic, to transfer the technology

08:03.449 --> 08:17.490
necessary for those people who diagnose African 
Swine Fever, and not only them, but also all the

08:03.449 --> 08:17.490
Caribbean countries and South and Central 
American countries. This university possesses

08:18.331 --> 08:27.685
the personnel that are qualified to head up that 
program, and I think international programs

08:29.302 --> 08:43.357
could very easily be the focal point from which a 
proposal could be turned into FAO and say, let

08:29.302 --> 08:43.357
Texas A&M provide the personnel and here's how 
much it would cost. They're looking for personnel

08:43.377 --> 08:56.912
right now, but it is, I think, there's been a 
discouragement of participation in in the

08:57.601 --> 09:02.247
international animal health problem.

09:02.267 --> 09:03.929
And here in our administration? In our own 
college, in our own university. Why do you think

09:08.034 --> 09:08.875
that is? Well, maybe because of the well-tried

09:09.756 --> 09:22.812
Texas axiom, you know, that what happens in other 
countries is no business of ours. We've got enough

09:23.613 --> 09:26.376
animal health problems in our own state we should 
direct our efforts to the solution of those and to

09:27.031 --> 09:31.858
hell with everybody else. I think that's the 
reason. Although I doubt very much that you would

09:34.261 --> 09:39.928
find anybody on this campus that would admit to 
that. That's the result.

09:44.094 --> 09:56.751
Also, if you disagree with existing policy and you 
try and point to people and say, We have to develop

09:57.743 --> 10:00.608
some knowledge about this disease. We can do it on 
foreign soil where it will not be a threat to Texas.

10:08.101 --> 10:17.937
We can make a significant contribution in this 
area by developing a vaccine against African

10:08.101 --> 10:17.937
swine fever or against babesiosis or against 
anaplasmosis. We have the opportunity to

10:18.959 --> 10:22.485
dispatch our people to foreign soil and let them 
set up a laboratory that that will work and address

10:23.461 --> 10:53.468
these problems without endangering our own uh 
situation at home and won't cost the state of Texas

10:23.461 --> 10:53.468
anything but you try and get these people to to uh to 
encourage that that type of thinking and they look

10:23.461 --> 10:53.468
the other way and they're the ones that are in 
charge of these decisions i've been very very

10:23.461 --> 10:53.468
disillusioned by by the

10:56.755 --> 11:04.725
by the morale that had been affected adversely 
here among people who are in this College of

10:56.755 --> 11:04.725
Veterinary Medicine. There are a lot of 
veterinarians who would like to do some research

11:04.745 --> 11:22.948
abroad, but there is no room under the present 
policy for this to happen, and it is not likely to

11:04.745 --> 11:22.948
change until the only way you can do that is to is to 
emulate the program in other universities. How do

11:28.100 --> 11:29.503
they respond? Why should $125,000 go to the 
University of Tennessee, who has yet to graduate

11:30.605 --> 11:44.430
its first student for agricultural research, 
when the state of Texas A&M has been here since

11:30.605 --> 11:44.430
1876? in the School of Veterinary Medicine since 
1916. Why should a university who is unproved in

11:49.185 --> 11:59.275
this field get $125,000 from a private

11:49.185 --> 11:59.275
industrial giant? Tennessee did. Tennessee did? 
Yeah. $125,000 of gift from the International

12:04.741 --> 12:14.991
Chemical and Mineral Corporation for research in 
in agricultural research, primarily with a

12:15.359 --> 12:22.747
tropical flavor, you know. There's no reason in 
the world why that money should not be here,

12:23.668 --> 12:35.000
because this College of Veterinary Medicine has 
more expertise in foreign animal diseases. It has

12:36.061 --> 12:41.687
the diagnostic laboratory here very, very, very 
close by. It has people who have served abroad and

12:42.106 --> 12:51.715
who want to serve abroad, but then if they serve 
abroad, they'll get out of the tenure track.

12:52.756 --> 12:53.157
Really? Sure. There's another point that I tried 
to sell. Why should a guy who was assigned as a

12:59.423 --> 13:07.911
member of the A&M teaching faculty abroad lose his 
opportunity to earn tenure. That doesn't make

13:10.702 --> 13:11.864
sense to me. If you consider him good enough to hire 
and respond to a contract and be classified as a

13:12.645 --> 13:29.849
member of the A&M team abroad, you should also 
consider him worthy of earning tenure. But he has

13:31.812 --> 13:34.616
no academic rank as long as he's abroad, you see. 
Unless he earned that academic rank before, he was

13:38.097 --> 13:39.398
dispatched abroad.

13:42.842 --> 13:48.028
So it sort of discriminates against a person who is 
interested in international education? I think

13:48.048 --> 13:48.708
so. I think so. I certainly have not elaborated any 
more proposals. I wrote dozens of proposals when I

13:53.474 --> 14:00.741
was director of the experiment, director of the 
Institute of Tropical Veterinary Medicine. And

14:02.383 --> 14:06.788
it so happened that my directorship coincided 
with the with the lowest awards in international

14:07.898 --> 14:21.441
veterinary medicine that this country had 
experienced. It's a very complex topic because

14:22.843 --> 14:31.257
you see AID, the Agency for International 
Development was instrumental in in organizing a

14:32.080 --> 14:41.030
method by which funds for international research 
could be apportioned to deserving universities.

14:41.891 --> 14:47.658
And they appointed a board that is called the Board 
of International Food and Agricultural

14:41.891 --> 14:47.658
Development. They appointed a committee that's 
called the Joint Committee for Agricultural

14:48.899 --> 14:53.845
Research. And another committee, and this is 
under the Title 12 program, And the Title 12

15:02.000 --> 15:13.918
program for two and a half years had not been well 
organized enough to make these awards

15:02.000 --> 15:13.918
expeditiously. They had spent too much time 
organizing themselves. As a matter of fact, our

15:18.164 --> 15:29.762
own President Miller is a member of one of those 
committees, the Joint Committee for

15:18.164 --> 15:29.762
Agricultural Development. Well, what I'm 
telling you is that if this university manifested

15:30.653 --> 15:47.288
a sincere effort to participate in international 
agricultural projects, that it could do so. We

15:48.489 --> 15:55.236
have, and particularly, an international animal 
health problem. We have the expertise. We have the

15:56.657 --> 15:57.758
willingness. and we have personnel who wish to be 
assigned abroad, but their economic stability

15:59.948 --> 16:17.445
cannot be guaranteed by assignment to one of these 
international projects. I have made no effort now

16:17.865 --> 16:25.213
because I had—I'm silent now in this area. I don't 
intend to to aggravate anybody else. I have done

16:31.588 --> 16:34.253
enough of that for the last four years. It is clear 
that they have not moved in that direction, and so

16:35.675 --> 16:51.943
it's useless for me to keep on fighting, and I must 
address my own interest, and that is to teach

16:35.675 --> 16:51.943
pathology. Okay, I have one final but large 
question to ask. Now, you left in 1959 and came back

16:57.364 --> 17:00.747
in 1975. 76. 76.

17:05.673 --> 17:07.975
What were the changes that you noticed when you got 
back? Changes in the College of Vet Medicine?

17:10.338 --> 17:11.739
Well, many changes. You know, when I left here, 
there were 32 people on the faculty. I would

17:20.813 --> 17:28.083
venture that today there's 140 on the teaching 
staff here, without counting them. That's my

17:28.223 --> 17:28.944
guess. That's a tremendous change. Whereas we 
used to accept only 64 a year, now they're taking

17:32.168 --> 17:42.122
145 or so candidates.

17:42.142 --> 17:46.888
And the growth has been phenomenal. not only in the 
College of Environmental Medicine, but

17:47.662 --> 17:50.606
university-wide.

17:52.849 --> 18:00.240
The construction of new buildings, the monies 
that this university has attracted for research

17:52.849 --> 18:00.240
purposes. We have some very, very outstanding 
scientists in other fields, such as nuclear

18:02.062 --> 18:13.078
physics, and such as in marine sciences. To answer 
your question, the primary

18:16.382 --> 18:27.288
changes that I have seen have been of phenomenal 
growth that would blow anybody's mind. Women

18:28.250 --> 18:30.235
students also. Yes, of course.

18:34.962 --> 18:46.896
When I was on the faculty here, every year they 
would take a poll among the faculty to find out

18:34.962 --> 18:46.896
whether we would support a coeducational 
university. Oh, really? Back in the 1950s? Yes,

18:48.517 --> 18:48.978
sir. Every year I voted in favor of it. Because 
there again, you see, the traditionalists were

18:52.642 --> 18:58.469
acting as an anchor around A&M's neck. They didn't 
want to admit any women.

19:04.747 --> 19:12.359
you know, to say that this is a provincial attitude 
is to utter a gross understatement. And the

19:13.942 --> 19:27.143
mentality of a lot of otherwise good Aggies who 
think that by preserving the traditions of A&M and

19:13.942 --> 19:27.143
all that, that they're going to to function in the 
best interest of the university. That's a fallacy

19:32.581 --> 19:39.690
that no one can impress them with adequately. Not 
even by hitting them across the forehead with a

19:40.912 --> 19:44.316
4x4. We could see that in the 50s when this 
university was losing enrollment to the other

19:46.178 --> 19:53.628
Southwest Conference schools. Our enrollment 
was really falling. because the kids didn't want

19:57.953 --> 20:01.857
to come here if there were no girls here. And 
another thing is that it's just immoral to deny

20:03.018 --> 20:15.651
admission to a woman simply because for the 
previous 75 years no woman had attended. You know,

20:15.671 --> 20:18.694
there's no reason. It was the final awakening and 
the realization when they started hitting A&M in

20:18.714 --> 20:26.121
the pocketbook that we were not going to attract 
deserving human beings to this university, in

20:27.012 --> 20:35.104
teaching, research, or in the student body, 
unless we changed our thinking. And it was that

20:36.226 --> 20:48.304
economic stress and the possibility of 
aggravating a bad economic state that caused A&M

20:36.226 --> 20:48.304
to change. And fortunately, we had a president 
here whose vision was unlimited, and that was Earl

20:49.125 --> 20:55.635
Rutter. and it was, it was, it was his vision and his 
leadership that embarked A&M upon a program of

20:56.746 --> 21:08.606
phenomenal growth, I think. Now how did, how did 
your colleagues back in the 1950s vote? Was it a

21:13.193 --> 21:15.838
pretty close vote about women, or? The faculty 
always overwhelmingly voted in favor of

21:15.878 --> 21:23.310
co-educational university. In the College of 
Medicine? Those that I knew. I really believe that

21:28.659 --> 21:35.891
this was the case among the faculty in the other 
departments as well. Oh yeah, it was. It was. But it

21:38.515 --> 21:50.935
was the student body and the alumni who were the 
unshakable traditionalists that kept A&M from

21:38.515 --> 21:50.935
being co-educational for so many years. And then 
finally there was a suit brought against A&M by

21:52.012 --> 21:58.040
women who wanted to attend the College of Animal 
Medicine. This is the only school in the state.

22:02.225 --> 22:10.636
They wouldn't have to go to court if people had the 
foresight, you know, to see that this was immoral.

22:11.838 --> 22:21.310
And it was this federal suit that was brought 
against A&M for this purpose that finally began to

22:22.032 --> 22:24.056
change a lot of people's minds. Yeah, this is the 
only land grant institution in the entire nation

22:26.140 --> 22:30.307
that was all male. There's no rhyme or reason for 
that, to that, but see there's a mentality among,

22:31.309 --> 22:41.087
among, among people in Texas that is difficult to 
put your finger on and say, this guy is going to

22:42.248 --> 22:57.169
think this way or going to react this way towards 
minorities or towards women or towards the

22:42.248 --> 22:57.169
possible benefits of expansion. There's a lot of 
people who even now today say that the worst thing

22:58.251 --> 23:10.568
that could have happened to A&M was for A&M to grow 
as rapidly as it did. we are going to pay the penalty

23:11.459 --> 23:38.327
for because we're not prepared for this 
phenomenal growth and we're going to be playing

23:11.459 --> 23:38.327
catch up and all but the statistics don't seem to 
support that that kind of thing we continue to draw

23:11.459 --> 23:38.327
tremendous sums of money for research I think that 
we we are at the latest count that I heard we were

23:11.459 --> 23:38.327
about number 17 in the country in the amount of 
research dollars that are poured into this

23:38.543 --> 23:45.210
country, into this university. It merits it. We 
genuinely have, I think, the best university in

23:47.153 --> 23:55.502
this country. It could be made better. We should 
not rest on our past laurels. Why do you think it's

24:02.430 --> 24:05.413
the best university in the country? Because of 
many reasons. Its location, because of the

24:09.560 --> 24:14.686
tremendous influence of agriculture on our 
state. And this is primarily an agricultural

24:15.427 --> 24:20.513
university. It has the biggest college of 
agriculture in the country. People come to A&M to

24:24.498 --> 24:31.146
learn about how to be better ranchers, better 
farmers, and better stockmen. better swine

24:31.919 --> 24:46.541
producers, or better poultry producers, or in 
horticulture, how to produce more fruit out of

24:31.919 --> 24:46.541
orchards, how to make use of our tremendous 
resources in the state. You know, our citrus

24:48.163 --> 25:01.403
industry could be improved greatly, and I think it 
would really compete with Florida and California

24:48.163 --> 25:01.403
if, you know, if the marketing difficulties could 
be worked out

25:01.957 --> 25:30.985
we can produce better grapefruit than Florida can 
our soil is better this this state is gifted with a

25:01.957 --> 25:30.985
tremendous number of resources

25:01.957 --> 25:30.985
not the least of which is oil but also a tremendous 
capacity to produce agriculturally and because

25:01.957 --> 25:30.985
of the experience and and the contributions that 
have been made by so many outstanding people.

25:39.320 --> 25:49.710
People in the animal science are doing incredible 
things in conjunction with our own

25:39.320 --> 25:49.710
veterinarians. They have, they have done a lot to 
increase the productivity of the state in

25:49.910 --> 25:57.237
agriculture. Okay, I'm gonna ask you one last 
question. All right. asked before, how would you

26:00.563 --> 26:06.151
summarize your contribution to the College of 
Veterinary Medicine? Well,

26:07.133 --> 26:24.117
I think that probably I rank

26:07.133 --> 26:24.117
my establishment of all three laboratories as my 
outstanding contribution to this university. In

26:24.137 --> 26:29.305
other words, the Institute of Tropical 
Veterinary Medicine had been in existence for 12

26:29.605 --> 26:48.732
years, and it didn't have a place to really do some 
outstanding research at Falcon Heights, in an

26:29.605 --> 26:48.732
area that is owned by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, and an area in which they have

26:29.605 --> 26:48.732
allowed us to work jointly with them. I 
established the laboratory, the Arthropod

26:51.396 --> 26:58.887
Tissue Culture Lab,

26:59.677 --> 27:06.784
thinking that by growing tick cell lines, we might 
be able to make a vaccine against Texas fever. Now,

27:07.725 --> 27:10.787
that's not, that work is still going on. We are the 
only laboratory in the Western Hemisphere that

27:10.827 --> 27:18.274
has grown those ticks in culture, adapted those 
cells to culture. And I think that those are

27:20.477 --> 27:26.342
probably my, my greatest contributions. I have 
taught over 300 veterinarians in the state of

27:27.470 --> 27:30.693
Texas. I think that that's also a contribution 
that I made to my profession here in the state. The

27:36.759 --> 27:39.262
head of my department was my student. Really? 
That's right, Dr. Pierce. The head of the

27:41.544 --> 27:46.989
physiology and pharmacology department was my 
student, Dr. McCready.

27:49.652 --> 27:52.255
I still have several of my students here. Dr. 
Crawford in public health was my student. Dr.

27:56.090 --> 28:00.335
Huff, Dr. Kleber, these guys were all students of 
mine.

28:03.239 --> 28:09.326
The present president of the Texas Veterinary 
Medical Association is the next student of mine.

28:10.467 --> 28:21.220
So I think that in these areas where I have helped to 
shape the destiny of some of our students, those

28:10.467 --> 28:21.220
are the ways in which I have contributed. Well, 
that's a good way to end the interview. Thank you

28:25.198 --> 28:26.248
very much.
