00:05.431 --> 00:10.017
This is February the 15th, sitting in the beautiful living room at 3007 Aztec.

00:10.037 --> 00:10.217
3009.

00:10.237 --> 00:17.066
3009 Aztec with Bob Boone.

00:17.787 --> 00:19.289
Bob, test yours.

00:20.010 --> 00:21.192
Testing, one, two, three, four.

00:25.117 --> 00:32.046
Bob, for the sake of a stranger in future years who might listen to this tape or read the transcription,

00:33.241 --> 00:39.188
Would you describe your background, where you grew up, and your experience before you first came to A&M?

00:40.350 --> 00:40.750
OK.

00:40.830 --> 00:45.236
I was born and partially raised in Baltimore, Maryland.

00:47.699 --> 00:50.582
My parents were divorced when I was like two years old.

00:50.682 --> 01:02.877
And my father got custody of me, so I went to live with an aunt who actually became more my mother than my mother.

01:03.802 --> 01:08.569
I grew up in Mount Airy, Maryland, through the sixth grade.

01:10.352 --> 01:18.564
And then my father had remarried, and I went to Baltimore for a year and lived with them.

01:18.604 --> 01:26.996
Went to public school there, Forest Park, Baltimore, which was a Jewish community, actually.

01:27.537 --> 01:31.142
So we enjoyed all the Jewish holidays.

01:32.827 --> 01:35.453
Then I went to West Nottingham Academy.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.122
Well, I went one year to Bel Air High School in Baltimore, too.

01:40.184 --> 01:50.548
But then I went to West Nottingham Academy, which was a boys prep school, the oldest boys prep school in the United States, a Presbyterian school.

01:52.081 --> 01:54.584
And our headmaster was J. Paul Slabaugh.

01:54.904 --> 01:55.725
I'll never forget him.

01:55.745 --> 01:56.686
He called him Pop.

01:58.428 --> 02:06.297
Graduated there, enlisted in the hospital corps because I had every intention of becoming a doctor.

02:08.259 --> 02:19.692
And then after I was in and went through boot camp and in the hospital corps as a junior medic, they attached me to the Fleet Marine Force.

02:20.836 --> 02:31.688
where I was a medic in the Marine Corps, which was a very difficult time because we wore Marine Corps uniforms and had to wear Navy insignia on them.

02:32.149 --> 02:36.634
And the Marines and the Navy did not get along very well in those days.

02:38.056 --> 02:48.868
But spent some time overseas, came back finally after three years, four months, and two days, and got out.

02:49.844 --> 02:56.298
And during the time I was in, though, in the service, I met my wife, my first wife, Audrey.

02:57.902 --> 03:04.697
I was aboard the carrier USS Saipan, and we, at that time, were training pilots

03:05.183 --> 03:08.586
for carrier landings off of Pensacola.

03:09.947 --> 03:25.001
And during one year, I forget which year it was actually now, but we came up, it was a small carrier, and we came up the ship channel, believe it or not, in Houston, literally could reach out off the hangar deck and touch ground, touch land.

03:25.942 --> 03:30.326
But we turned around in the turning basin in Houston and stayed there for a week, for Navy week.

03:31.287 --> 03:35.190
And I met Audrey during that week at one of the Navy mother's dances.

03:35.170 --> 03:39.554
And we continued corresponding thereafter.

03:41.076 --> 03:56.311
I went back to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and I had no real family in Maryland anymore, other than aunts and uncles.

03:57.773 --> 04:00.395
My father had died when I was 14.

04:01.637 --> 04:03.979
That's one reason I went back to West Nottingham Academy.

04:05.242 --> 04:06.904
It was a boarding school.

04:08.707 --> 04:13.934
And worked my way through there, by the way, waiting tables and singing songs in a waiter's trio.

04:17.959 --> 04:22.766
Went back to Maryland and really didn't have any reason to stay there.

04:22.806 --> 04:26.431
And Audrey was in Houston at the time.

04:27.332 --> 04:29.775
So I came down here in December.

04:31.177 --> 04:33.240
We married on January the 3rd.

04:34.486 --> 04:37.849
And I started University of Houston January the 15th.

04:39.371 --> 04:42.173
And I started as a pre-med student.

04:42.774 --> 04:45.897
I went three years, three and a half years as a pre-med student.

04:46.337 --> 04:47.358
And I was doing very well.

04:47.579 --> 04:51.563
I had a little trouble with quantitative chemistry.

04:52.403 --> 04:54.786
But otherwise, it was going fine.

04:55.827 --> 05:02.333
But I suddenly realized, and of course, I was carrying on jobs, two or three jobs simultaneously.

05:03.224 --> 05:05.607
and doing all the musicals at the university.

05:06.649 --> 05:12.878
It was natural for me to do that because I'd been singing all my life and playing trombone.

05:14.219 --> 05:19.667
Anyway, I realized suddenly that it was gonna take me 12 more years to have a family and a home.

05:20.568 --> 05:23.653
And I wanted that more dearly than I wanted to be a doctor.

05:24.614 --> 05:25.595
So I switched majors.

05:27.178 --> 05:32.505
And in the meantime, I got orders, it was during the Korean conflict then,

05:32.857 --> 05:34.579
They were short of medics then.

05:35.881 --> 05:40.707
I got orders to come back as a medic for the Marine Corps.

05:41.488 --> 05:46.594
Well, I got an extension for the birth of my son, Ricky.

05:47.315 --> 05:49.158
He was born the 4th of July, 1951.

05:49.258 --> 05:54.104
I got that extension.

05:54.144 --> 06:00.552
Then I got another extension to graduate in August of that summer.

06:00.869 --> 06:04.875
Knowing I had my orders, I hadn't bothered to look for a job or do anything.

06:04.935 --> 06:06.017
I was ready to go back in.

06:06.998 --> 06:11.985
Well, so happens, they canceled my orders without me getting notified.

06:12.807 --> 06:16.031
We went down to New Orleans to the Naval Headquarters and found that out.

06:17.433 --> 06:25.005
And there I was without anything and a new baby and everything, you know, just loaded.

06:26.307 --> 06:30.673
Anyway, Les Richardson, who was the superintendent of schools here at that time,

06:31.025 --> 06:41.799
Came down to Houston to the placement center for interviews and he interviewed me on Saturday and I came to work on Monday, the following Monday.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.441
At what is now at A&M?

06:43.582 --> 06:46.686
A&M Consolidated High School, Elementary School.

06:47.227 --> 06:51.953
It was all now where the conference center is on George Bush Boulevard.

06:54.076 --> 07:00.424
The big yellow brick building was the high school, then the junior high and the elementary schools were all frame buildings.

07:00.927 --> 07:02.550
south of that main building.

07:04.292 --> 07:07.758
The superintendent's office was in there and everything.

07:08.619 --> 07:17.533
But I started that job in 1951, August of 1951, and I stayed there for seven years.

07:17.934 --> 07:19.296
What was the starting pay?

07:20.258 --> 07:22.902
$210 a month.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.727
A little over $2,400 a year.

07:28.708 --> 07:29.549
It was scary.

07:30.850 --> 07:33.112
And Audrey and I, again, with a new baby.

07:33.272 --> 07:38.477
But, you know, as I look back now, Audrey and I talked about this many times before she died.

07:39.398 --> 07:42.641
Those were some, really, probably some of the happiest years of our lives.

07:43.061 --> 07:46.144
But I'll never forget the first day I brought her up here from Houston.

07:47.305 --> 07:53.631
Highway 6 was what would now be considered a single lane of the highway.

07:54.033 --> 08:00.494
Oh, she was so scared because she had been a city girl most of her life.

08:01.598 --> 08:03.283
Anyway, I taught there.

08:03.871 --> 08:05.593
band, choir and drama.

08:05.753 --> 08:08.737
Les hired me to start the choral program.

08:09.758 --> 08:15.405
Colonel Dunn who had retired from A&M was doing the band there.

08:15.806 --> 08:17.908
I think he had like 14 kids in the band.

08:18.989 --> 08:22.974
And he'd go to football games and play things like the Nutcracker Suite you know.

08:23.735 --> 08:28.461
Well the kids didn't really enjoy that and neither did the people at the games.

08:28.762 --> 08:33.328
But he's the man who taught me how to conduct right-handed.

08:33.928 --> 08:37.693
I'm a left-handed person and I'd conduct left-handed.

08:38.114 --> 08:43.720
Well it's like doing it in the mirror, it's backwards to an old group.

08:44.581 --> 08:53.132
But he made me put my left hand in my pocket and conduct the band and everything else that I did.

08:54.800 --> 09:01.592
We finally had, and I of course did all the plays and dramas, Wynike plays.

09:03.756 --> 09:08.424
Actually we won a state contest in UIL with the Wynike play.

09:09.646 --> 09:11.790
Bill Hite.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.753
About your first years.

09:14.138 --> 09:16.502
About how many seniors were there?

09:16.542 --> 09:18.806
That'll tell about the size of the high school.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.609
At the high school.

09:21.591 --> 09:22.913
Have any idea what the size was?

09:23.013 --> 09:25.197
Not more than 14, 15.

09:27.140 --> 09:31.167
When I came, it was a C school, class C school.

09:32.229 --> 09:34.172
And then we quickly went to A.

09:35.570 --> 09:46.510
Fred Anderson you may know, Dr. Fred Anderson, was a quarterback on one of the first football teams when I was there.

09:47.632 --> 09:59.113
Jimmy Bond was one of the first people I ever gave a solo to in a musical play.

09:59.093 --> 10:05.080
A lot of the kids, some of them are still rare and all retiring.

10:06.682 --> 10:08.465
Anyway I taught there seven years.

10:08.705 --> 10:10.247
It just got too much.

10:10.347 --> 10:18.697
I was in school from like 6 o'clock in the morning until 10 or 11 o'clock at night with rehearsals and so forth.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.861
And it just got overloaded.

10:23.680 --> 10:30.629
So I went to El Campo, Texas for two years, and there only did choir and drama and speech.

10:31.089 --> 10:31.870
Didn't have band.

10:31.970 --> 10:33.492
They had a great band director there.

10:35.174 --> 10:36.416
Then we had another baby.

10:36.536 --> 10:37.257
We had Walter.

10:38.819 --> 10:43.585
It seemed like every time I'd change jobs, we'd have another baby.

10:44.105 --> 10:45.447
The doctor said it was my fault.

10:48.010 --> 10:51.274
Then we stayed there two years and moved back here

10:51.811 --> 10:59.869
Well, actually, Bill Turner had been directing The Sync Adits at that time for six, I think he was a total of 16 years.

11:01.654 --> 11:09.752
And he then was going to Stephen F. Austin in Nacogdoches as head of the music department.

11:09.918 --> 11:13.042
And Mrs. Rudder called me in El Campo.

11:14.023 --> 11:19.570
I taught their kids, her kids, the generals and hers in high school here.

11:20.291 --> 11:23.415
And she said, Bob Owen, get your buns up here.

11:24.876 --> 11:26.098
It's just the way she said it.

11:26.759 --> 11:28.000
And I said, yes, ma'am.

11:29.102 --> 11:36.010
And I came up and interviewed with J. Wayne Stark, who was then director of the Memorial Student Center.

11:37.255 --> 11:49.100
and went to work as a student advisor at the Memorial Student Center, director of the Singing Cadets, and director of the A&M Methodist Church Choir.

11:50.082 --> 11:53.188
Those two jobs, because Bill had had them both,

11:53.557 --> 11:54.558
We're tied together.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.280
If you did one, you did the other.

11:57.361 --> 11:59.644
So I stayed at that church for 10 years.

12:00.445 --> 12:04.269
What was the seeing cadet compensation when you started?

12:04.309 --> 12:04.770
Do you remember?

12:05.411 --> 12:06.852
Yeah, I started for $6,000.

12:06.953 --> 12:08.614
And what year was that?

12:08.634 --> 12:09.315
60.

12:10.837 --> 12:12.599
There were 6,000 students.

12:12.619 --> 12:13.580
No, I started for 6,600.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.561
I'm sorry.

12:14.922 --> 12:17.725
There were 6,000 students, all male, all core.

12:18.025 --> 12:18.986
And the Rudders?

12:19.006 --> 12:19.887
Some grad students.

12:20.027 --> 12:25.093
The Rudders had only been here about a year, so they were comparatively new.

12:25.113 --> 12:29.538
Well, they'd been here a little longer than I because I taught their kids in high school.

12:29.578 --> 12:31.339
You were how long at El Campo?

12:31.359 --> 12:31.660
Two years?

12:31.680 --> 12:31.900
Seven.

12:32.341 --> 12:33.362
Yeah, two years.

12:33.422 --> 12:34.122
Oh, okay.

12:34.203 --> 12:34.863
All right.

12:34.883 --> 12:37.466
I was through, well, 57 through 59.

12:37.546 --> 12:37.766
All right.

12:38.307 --> 12:41.270
Because I came here in August of 70.

12:41.651 --> 12:41.991
Okay.

12:43.405 --> 12:44.567
That's 60, excuse me.

12:44.608 --> 12:45.329
August of 60.

12:45.489 --> 12:46.171
Right.

12:47.454 --> 12:54.428
And administratively, the singing cadets were a part of the MSC.

12:54.569 --> 12:54.889
Right.

12:54.909 --> 12:57.395
They were, quote, student activity.

12:57.415 --> 13:00.261
So on paper, you reported to Wayne Stark.

13:00.281 --> 13:01.002
Right.

13:01.022 --> 13:01.363
And...

13:01.343 --> 13:16.966
I was the advisor to Town Hall, which now has become Opus because in those days we had Town Hall which did both classical and popular programs in G. Raleigh White.

13:18.909 --> 13:20.311
We did the musicals.

13:22.955 --> 13:26.019
We still did some of the summer musicals in Guyon Hall.

13:26.159 --> 13:28.583
It was still there.

13:29.204 --> 13:34.891
The only thing that bothered us there was the squeaky wooden chairs during a performance, people moving around.

13:35.572 --> 13:42.420
As you began, did anyone describe for you what your duties and responsibilities were?

13:42.440 --> 13:44.242
And if so, can you summarize those?

13:46.305 --> 13:50.450
Well, Wayne was my boss.

13:51.772 --> 13:53.794
He was the boss.

13:55.141 --> 14:04.555
I was to take care of any musical activities that had to do with the Memorial Student Center and the student body other than band.

14:06.197 --> 14:14.209
Now Bill Turner had also directed the Aggieland Dance Band and I did that for about six years.

14:16.132 --> 14:16.632
Excuse me.

14:18.014 --> 14:21.840
But we had a music committee at MSC which

14:22.394 --> 14:28.236
I began through the browsing library where we brought in recorded music for people to listen to.

14:28.807 --> 14:41.037
We had practice rooms in the old MSC, and this was the old MSC, because we used to have muster, for instance, on the front lawn of the Memorial Student Center, and stand on those steps facing the sun.

14:41.077 --> 14:48.003
This thing you guys would have to stay there, and I'd have guys pass out doing the thing, because we stood there the whole time.

14:48.043 --> 14:49.365
We didn't have a chance to sit down.

14:50.986 --> 14:53.948
That entrance is now covered and gone.

14:55.550 --> 14:58.172
I did...

15:00.025 --> 15:08.696
We started what we called the basement committee, which in those days the guys didn't have anywhere to go much on weekends.

15:08.716 --> 15:12.621
And so we started a club down under the building.

15:13.262 --> 15:14.303
The floor was dirt.

15:15.164 --> 15:22.253
The foundation was, the columns were, we were among the columns, so to speak, and we decorated it.

15:22.233 --> 15:27.020
And we'd have, on Saturday nights, we'd have a nightclub kind of thing.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.304
We'd serve Cokes and stuff, and popcorn, free.

15:31.406 --> 15:34.951
And we'd have entertainers, student entertainers come in.

15:35.972 --> 15:38.495
So it was a good chance for them to get some exposure.

15:39.016 --> 15:40.538
Let's see, back to beginning.

15:41.780 --> 15:46.787
Did you come over and you interviewed with Wayne Stark?

15:46.807 --> 15:50.552
Did you have the impression that others were being considered...

15:51.798 --> 15:52.459
Oh, yeah.

15:52.859 --> 15:55.101
Oh, yeah.

15:55.342 --> 15:59.666
I forget the sequence there, but I came and was interviewed by Wayne.

16:01.308 --> 16:08.095
And it was like probably three weeks, four weeks before I got notification, yes, you've been hired, blah, blah, blah.

16:08.495 --> 16:09.016
Come on up.

16:09.817 --> 16:15.763
And luckily, my wife and I, Audrey and I, had not sold the house that we had lived in.

16:16.520 --> 16:24.413
When we left here, we were renting it, and it was on Park Place, just a little matchbox thing that we had added a room on.

16:25.415 --> 16:31.385
But it had been built during the Second World War by students out of scrap lumber.

16:32.787 --> 16:39.979
Anyway, we felt very fortunate to have that to come back to, but we only stayed there.

16:40.702 --> 16:53.277
another year after we got back and bought the house that we then lived in on Armistead, which was a great location because it was right off the golf course and easy to get to.

16:53.437 --> 16:57.682
And that's where I used to train, drill my A&M consolidated band.

16:57.702 --> 17:04.049
It was a Dobovani property and we'd walk through cow pads where we drilled in the afternoons.

17:04.910 --> 17:06.692
As a newcomer,

17:07.145 --> 17:25.753
who had not graduated from the Agricultural Mechanical College of Texas, did you early on encounter any difficulties or kind of stares that you might be an outsider?

17:26.033 --> 17:28.697
No, no, not ever once.

17:29.698 --> 17:31.141
See, I'd been here seven years.

17:31.922 --> 17:34.806
And during those seven years, I used to invite

17:35.360 --> 18:00.625
the sing cadets the agonizer quartet over to the high school because I was trying to recruit guys in my music program there you know and Betty Bolander who used to work for Bill Turner as his accompanist and I and we do summer musicals I did the summer musical the Mikado with Bill and Betty you know out in the Grove and

18:01.465 --> 18:05.913
So I was coming home, more or less.

18:06.013 --> 18:07.075
It felt that way.

18:07.435 --> 18:11.803
And you were thorough... As you know, you can't live in this community without maroon blood, you know.

18:11.823 --> 18:11.923
Sure.

18:12.424 --> 18:17.112
And you were, then you were quite well...

18:17.092 --> 18:23.780
informed about Aggie traditions and how to do this and that?

18:23.920 --> 18:24.401
Oh, some.

18:25.162 --> 18:26.043
Not totally.

18:26.744 --> 18:36.856
I mean, for instance, I didn't know about the tradition within the singing cadets that they had to answer specific questions as a new member in order.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.459
They were kind of on probation when they first got in.

18:40.240 --> 18:41.822
We called them bufos.

18:41.842 --> 18:43.164
What would be some of those questions?

18:43.184 --> 18:45.647
Well, they would all be campusology questions.

18:46.015 --> 18:53.452
They had to memorize what was on some statues around campus and on cornerstones and things like that.

18:54.474 --> 18:56.900
When such and such was built, you know.

18:56.920 --> 19:02.573
Was this more intense than the average freshman cadet?

19:03.650 --> 19:05.312
Yeah, I think so.

19:07.195 --> 19:12.463
Of course, we got criticized for it by some of the administration for having to do that.

19:12.603 --> 19:20.094
And for the guys, we started what we called the Bufo program in about 64.

19:20.675 --> 19:25.742
Because you see, when I came, it was all core.

19:26.043 --> 19:27.847
It stopped being all-core.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.210
We started getting non-regs in.

19:30.132 --> 19:32.818
Some veterans coming back, all kinds of things.

19:33.619 --> 19:41.436
And so we wanted them to earn, quote, the right to be in the Singing Cadets other than just a vocal audition.

19:42.142 --> 19:43.824
And so we had them wear a key.

19:43.844 --> 19:56.022
We had Charlie Myers built or designed this logo that we used, this scene cadet logo.

19:57.303 --> 20:01.129
And we had them start wearing keys with that on it.

20:01.189 --> 20:08.980
And they had, the point was to get every other man's signature in the group so they get to meet each other.

20:10.061 --> 20:11.203
And it was PR.

20:11.605 --> 20:14.229
you know, for the group.

20:14.249 --> 20:17.733
But mainly it was a fellowshipping kind of purpose.

20:18.875 --> 20:23.141
And we got, boy, we got severely criticized for that after a while.

20:23.682 --> 20:26.005
You know, you're embarrassing our students, blah, blah, blah.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.046
Well, they weren't embarrassed.

20:27.066 --> 20:29.049
They were having a ball doing it.

20:29.490 --> 20:32.174
And they were getting to know the other men in the group.

20:32.734 --> 20:33.575
And that was the point.

20:33.796 --> 20:34.797
That was the whole point.

20:35.738 --> 20:38.322
But we couldn't get anybody to explain that.

20:39.044 --> 21:07.212
Were there as you began were there any I'll call them traditional were were there traditional events where the singing cadets were expected to be At a certain place to do certain things well certainly Aggie muster musters here I Started well even that first year

21:07.664 --> 21:24.728
uh singing commencement as a soloist you know leading the spirit um and a lot of people didn't know that there were two verses to the war hymns so we took that upon ourselves as a project

21:25.214 --> 21:29.118
to try to teach everybody the first and second verse to the war hymn.

21:29.819 --> 21:34.224
Because the first verse doesn't talk about TU, but the second one does.

21:34.905 --> 21:39.290
And I told the guys, well they get enough publicity, we don't need help to give them any.

21:42.373 --> 21:50.262
And by the way, and the words to the spirit were changed, and I didn't do that.

21:51.984 --> 21:52.605
Pinky,

21:54.577 --> 21:55.539
Not Pinky Downs.

21:56.360 --> 21:59.706
Oh, gosh, I forget his name now.

22:00.327 --> 22:03.933
But the writer of it changed the words.

22:04.474 --> 22:12.708
You know, when we say we are from Texas, AMU now, it used to be AMC, of course.

22:12.728 --> 22:18.017
And he changed that when we became a university to fit the situation.

22:18.197 --> 22:19.018
The Aggies are true.

22:19.139 --> 22:20.601
We are from Texas, AMU.

22:22.252 --> 22:25.375
And boy, did I get flack when that happened.

22:25.395 --> 22:27.618
Everybody thought I just arbitrarily did that.

22:29.099 --> 22:29.760
And I didn't do it.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.943
And I have his letter to prove that he did it.

22:34.305 --> 22:35.526
I forget what year that was.

22:37.848 --> 22:44.876
We didn't actually change it until about the words until about a half a year, a year after the fact.

22:45.716 --> 22:46.737
After the name was changed.

22:46.757 --> 22:48.259
After the name was changed, right.

22:50.517 --> 22:54.000
Well, let's see back to what I was supposed to do.

22:55.181 --> 22:57.223
I was in charge of the Aggie talent show.

22:58.865 --> 23:01.688
I was in charge of the intercollegiate talent show.

23:04.170 --> 23:10.797
That's where we used to go up to TSCW and pick an Aggie sweetheart in those days.

23:11.898 --> 23:16.102
And we'd go up there for a couple of days, then they'd come down here for five days.

23:16.802 --> 23:17.503
It was a ball.

23:17.872 --> 23:19.536
That was all through student government.

23:20.618 --> 23:23.886
And I was the advisor to student government in those days.

23:25.970 --> 23:29.719
I was kind of a jack of all trades.

23:29.799 --> 23:34.530
I was advisor for several of the classes.

23:36.788 --> 23:43.144
Then I began teaching a class in music appreciation, Humanities 201.

23:44.848 --> 23:51.405
And I started with one section and got it built up to six sections.

23:51.959 --> 23:53.963
And I couldn't do all that by myself.

23:54.905 --> 23:59.836
And besides, Texas A&M or the Cine Cadets were becoming more and more busy.

24:00.216 --> 24:04.425
I mean, we were doing an average of 40, 50, 60 shows a year.

24:04.746 --> 24:06.891
When you began, about how many shows a year?

24:07.171 --> 24:09.917
The first year I was here, I was just looking at it the other night.

24:09.897 --> 24:26.652
We did 27 and that included the Christmas program, muster, some banquets at MSC, very little out of town that first year.

24:27.473 --> 24:30.676
What kind of uniforms were they wearing when you began?

24:31.397 --> 24:37.002
Basically the same kind of uniform they're wearing now except that it was black.

24:37.538 --> 24:40.863
Now they wear, it's a navy blue they wear.

24:41.284 --> 24:42.566
They're almost Air Force blue.

24:42.706 --> 24:44.149
And a maroon bow tie.

24:44.429 --> 24:44.690
Right.

24:45.210 --> 24:45.791
White shirt.

24:45.972 --> 24:50.259
And how that all came about, the year before I came here, T.L.

24:50.339 --> 24:59.033
Smith from Columbus donated the whole set of uniforms to the scene cadets.

24:59.774 --> 25:01.116
And, of course, that was the year...

25:01.737 --> 25:04.421
Bill left, Bill Turner.

25:05.562 --> 25:11.911
But prior to that, before they got those uniforms, they wore core uniforms.

25:12.833 --> 25:15.556
And the seniors always were on the front row with their boots.

25:17.239 --> 25:19.502
And that was the hierarchy in the Syncanets when I came.

25:19.983 --> 25:22.226
It was strictly a class hierarchy.

25:22.286 --> 25:23.447
The seniors were in command.

25:23.948 --> 25:24.809
They were in charge.

25:25.550 --> 25:31.018
And they made sure the freshmen shaped up and learned the music.

25:31.184 --> 25:35.792
I mean, I remember I was kind of in a state of shock when I first came here.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.775
I'd walk into the music hall.

25:37.815 --> 25:39.398
We rehearsed on the second floor.

25:40.820 --> 25:46.510
And after it was condensed six times, we moved out, but then moved into G. Riley White.

25:46.911 --> 25:53.462
But I remember that first year I'd come in many afternoons or after rehearsal.

25:54.235 --> 26:05.217
And they'd have, the seniors would have some freshman fish braced, boy, against the wall and really chewing them out, I mean, up one side and down the other.

26:05.838 --> 26:11.489
And having been in the Marine Corps, I was used to that kind of activity, but I didn't expect any of it.

26:11.509 --> 26:12.531
You know, it was funny.

26:13.085 --> 26:21.918
But I got used to it, and we actually, that's why we started the Bufo program in 64, because we lost, it wasn't all corps anymore.

26:22.498 --> 26:25.863
And so we lost that hierarchy, we lost that chain of command.

26:26.644 --> 26:30.370
And so we had to have old men, quote, old men and Bufos.

26:31.091 --> 26:36.358
And of course, Bufos is the Italian word in opera for comic, or

26:36.625 --> 26:38.267
That's B-U-F-O?

26:38.768 --> 26:39.709
B-U-F-F-O.

26:39.909 --> 26:40.290
Two Fs.

26:40.690 --> 26:41.011
UFO.

26:41.652 --> 26:53.448
As you began, could you characterize the senior cadets by where they were from in terms of background and their majors here and so forth?

26:54.269 --> 26:55.390
Well, kind of.

26:57.353 --> 26:59.656
I have the impression that they were all country boys.

27:02.179 --> 27:05.704
They say it was a country boy college, poor boy school, blah, blah, blah.

27:06.562 --> 27:18.008
But they were all ageing in engineering, very few in education, very few then.

27:18.068 --> 27:23.440
Later it became more prevalent.

27:23.858 --> 27:25.962
I have so many guys who had graduated from St.

27:26.243 --> 27:32.235
Cadets who went out and became pastors, preachers, and doctors.

27:33.057 --> 27:34.760
Of course, they couldn't do that here.

27:35.562 --> 27:42.255
But lots of doctors and dentists and preachers and even some choir directors.

27:42.674 --> 27:47.079
But for most of them, it truly was an avocation, a joy.

27:47.099 --> 27:47.940
Oh, definitely.

27:48.281 --> 27:48.861
Definitely.

27:49.442 --> 27:51.865
They were there because they loved to be there.

27:52.285 --> 27:53.186
They loved to sing.

27:53.967 --> 27:54.768
They loved to perform.

27:54.848 --> 27:59.494
They took great pride in representing Texas A&M.

28:00.114 --> 28:02.137
I mean, that was their thing.

28:02.497 --> 28:06.622
Had there been tryouts in years before you got here?

28:06.642 --> 28:07.243
Yes.

28:07.323 --> 28:07.823
How did you?

28:08.484 --> 28:09.906
I continued them.

28:09.946 --> 28:11.027
We'd have auditions.

28:12.442 --> 28:19.509
at the beginning of each semester, and I'd have them sing Home on the Range.

28:20.911 --> 28:34.785
And that became a kind of joke, but that's what it did, because it has a good range in it, and if they could sing that, and most of them kind of knew it before they came to audition, you know, they had sung that as a kid in school or somewhere.

28:34.966 --> 28:37.268
Do you know the last name of the man who wrote that?

28:38.176 --> 28:40.399
Uh, uh, Ewing?

28:40.419 --> 28:40.719
Ewing?

28:41.060 --> 28:43.783
All right, either the words or... Guyon.

28:43.803 --> 28:45.385
Guyon, Guyon, Guyon, Guyon.

28:45.726 --> 28:47.107
Same family as Guyon Hall.

28:47.128 --> 28:47.909
Right, right.

28:51.193 --> 28:55.719
But they used that, and then I'd have them attempt to sight-read something.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.462
And some of them could.

28:58.803 --> 29:03.829
I mean, some of them were instrumentalists in their high school band or somewhere.

29:04.568 --> 29:05.929
And they could read pretty well.

29:06.290 --> 29:13.537
Some of them, as we went along, we began to get some All-State type people, UIL All-State people.

29:14.358 --> 29:16.980
But most of them were not readers.

29:17.781 --> 29:19.523
Some of them were not even good singers.

29:20.304 --> 29:31.254
But if they exhibited to me any sort of spirit and enthusiasm, that organization needed that, not just good singers.

29:32.155 --> 29:33.917
So we had, we've

29:34.252 --> 29:40.141
The average round number in the group was 60, but it varied from year to year.

29:40.161 --> 29:42.044
That's why we had auditions twice a year.

29:42.765 --> 29:57.407
The first semester we'd have auditions and we'd lose some guys at the end of the semester, either through great grades because they had to maintain their grades or graduation or they quit school or whatever.

29:58.163 --> 30:12.032
And so we'd have auditions the second semester, but the big audition time was in the fall, and we'd take probably at the second audition session, maybe half as many as we took in the fall session.

30:12.974 --> 30:18.045
And most of them, most of them stayed three years, four years.

30:18.025 --> 30:33.600
Do you remember in your early years, as you now look back, any missteps you made in terms of an old-time Aggie?

30:34.041 --> 30:37.925
Is there anything where you blundered?

30:39.807 --> 30:46.193
Well, usually as we traveled, we traveled in two chartered buses.

30:47.236 --> 30:50.401
And bus one was the quiet bus, because that's the one I rode.

30:51.663 --> 30:53.987
And it's a steady bus.

30:54.007 --> 30:56.150
Or they might play checkers or something.

30:56.731 --> 31:00.437
But I always sat in the front seat, and I never turned around.

31:01.138 --> 31:03.301
I just never saw what was going on.

31:03.642 --> 31:06.126
But bus two was another story.

31:07.087 --> 31:14.138
I mean, we'd look out the rear view windows on the side of the bus, and bus two would be coming down the highway rocking silent.
