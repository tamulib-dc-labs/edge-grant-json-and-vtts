WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:03.994
And then we paid him back. And that was sort of 
symbolic of the community as it was in those days.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.545
Was there any place that was kind of off limits? Was 
Uncle Ed's still going? Uncle Ed's was still

00:13.948 --> 00:15.090
going. It wasn't off limits. It was a pretty going 
place. Uncle Ed's was torn down. I guess it was my

00:21.640 --> 00:26.507
end of my junior year. It must have been the end of my 
junior year. So that would have been in not going.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.144
to be sure I hadn't taken it over. And it was still 
going until about your junior year? I think they

00:43.235 --> 00:47.304
tore it down the end of my junior year. I can't 
remember for sure. The reason I know it was during

00:48.687 --> 00:52.776
my time here is we had a crepper ceremony for it. Do 
you know what a crepper ceremony was? Describe.

00:57.035 --> 01:03.747
This was really oriented around people who got a 
Dear John letter. And there were a lot of those in

01:03.987 --> 01:05.450
those days. Typically you'd come here as a 
freshman and you'd have a high school girlfriend

01:05.490 --> 01:11.541
and somewhere along that fall semester you'd get 
the letter. And we had a little ceremony. uh and in

01:14.399 --> 01:38.972
the ceremony you would all dress up in your 
raincoats and ponchos i mean ponchos and pots and

01:14.399 --> 01:38.972
you would carry brooms and you would mourn your way 
through the halls of the then you would go in you

01:14.399 --> 01:38.972
would all the entire outfit would crowd into one of 
the gang restrooms and the person that was being

01:38.952 --> 01:54.328
affected was called to the center and the letter 
was read to everyone and then it was torn up and put

01:38.952 --> 01:54.328
into the crapper there were there were four no 
there were five uh uh sit down crappers and then two

01:54.950 --> 02:18.493
urinals making seven and you had a 21 crapper 
salute there were people stationed at each one and

01:54.950 --> 02:18.493
you would sprinkle a letter around and you would 
flush it and then of course you would make your way

01:54.950 --> 02:18.493
back to your room and that well we had one of those 
for uncle ed's when it was torn down it was pretty

01:54.950 --> 02:18.493
tragic thing and so we we had a crapper sermon All 
right, now during that day, if someone wanted to

02:18.473 --> 02:25.423
just go drink some beer, where did they go? Most of 
the time, like as a freshman and sophomore, you

02:28.066 --> 02:33.995
would go to the river. You'd find somebody, you'd 
get a couple of cases, or not cases, but kegs. You'd

02:39.905 --> 02:45.192
go out and find a place on the Brazos River where it 
was safe and away from everything. And then you'd

02:45.252 --> 02:48.649
swim in the river and drink and play games. it was 
just common and was generally all male all male

02:49.557 --> 03:13.017
absolutely then if you if someone wanted to drink 
hard liquor i mean drink whiskey yeah well it

02:49.557 --> 03:13.017
wasn't a lot of that that went on but you went to 
whiskey you had to go to whiskey bridge obviously

02:49.557 --> 03:13.017
to get it and there was it wasn't that hard to buy i 
had a A fellow that was a senior in my outfit when I

03:13.553 --> 03:20.503
was a freshman, he was an ag engineer and had a 
drawing table in his room. Name was Jerry Simpton.

03:23.267 --> 03:28.153
Jerry is the president of the bank in Del Rio today 
and would deny this, I'm sure. But Jerry had a side

03:28.974 --> 03:36.926
business which was converting your driver's 
license to one showing that you were 21 years of age

03:28.974 --> 03:36.926
or older. And it was, in those days, the driver's 
license was paper. And he would pin it to his

03:42.646 --> 03:52.640
drawing board and very adroitly cut out the right 
numbers and switch them, and then laminate the

03:42.646 --> 03:52.640
driver's license. And it was quite a talent. He was 
very good at it. So there were several people that

03:56.285 --> 04:00.791
had a driver's license that allowed you to. And of 
course, the folks that were selling the liquor

04:01.192 --> 04:09.143
would wink, and it really wasn't a big problem. By 
the time I was an upperclassman, there were a few

04:09.781 --> 04:12.563
places around. Uncle Ed's was a place you drank 
beer and ate barbecue. Martin's, a place called

04:16.027 --> 04:21.852
Eastgate Lounge, which was just a little bar. And 
then there were some places in North Bryan, which

04:22.592 --> 04:30.119
probably a person wouldn't go to today. But in 
those days, Highway 21 from downtown Bryan headed

04:30.920 --> 04:38.927
west, there were probably a half a dozen just who to 
hell places that you could go and drink beer and

04:39.245 --> 04:43.049
listen to jukebox. Let's go back to your being 
Corps Commander. You get here in the fall. Did

04:48.135 --> 04:55.664
anyone give you a kind of a guideline or 
responsibility as a set of goals or anything? Not

04:58.227 --> 04:58.628
really. I mean, that was pretty much ours to 
develop, although Colonel Baker, who was the

04:58.648 --> 05:06.417
commandant, was... I mentioned a couple of things 
a while ago. Also, just fundamental discipline

05:09.045 --> 05:21.621
and harassment and that sort of thing was 
difficult to control in those days. And he had a

05:21.601 --> 05:30.110
major concern, which was an appropriate one, 
about the rate of departure of kids coming in here.

05:30.670 --> 05:38.619
So one of the things we worked very hard on starting 
the year was to try to retain as many as possible,

05:30.670 --> 05:38.619
and with some success. And we had a really good 
group of commanders that year. A guy named Pat

05:43.724 --> 05:50.511
Gamble, who's a four-star in the Air Force, was 
commander of one of the Air Force wings. Arturo

05:51.166 --> 06:04.018
Esquivel, who was commander of the Air Division, 
which was the senior Air Force commander, and a

05:51.166 --> 06:04.018
couple of guys on the Army side that were just 
outstanding. So we had good solid, not to any

06:04.078 --> 06:10.464
surprise to you, good leadership selected. But 
what was the Corps enrollment then? Do you

06:12.907 --> 06:13.327
remember? We started that fall probably close to 
3,000. And by the end of the year, we were probably

06:16.310 --> 06:20.734
down to Oh, somewhere around 25, 2600 would be my 
guess. So it was, you know, it was already down

06:25.321 --> 06:28.666
significantly. As the fall semester got 
underway, what was the daily routine for the

06:28.686 --> 06:35.357
weekday for the corps commander? Not sure I can 
remember. It was long days, that's all I remember.

06:41.527 --> 06:52.965
I had a deputy corps commander named Robert Bean 
who was an electrical engineer, had been on corps

06:41.527 --> 06:52.965
staff, very, very bright guy. The thing I remember 
about Robert is he was so disciplined that he would

06:52.945 --> 07:06.142
go to class and then come home every night at the end 
of the day, no matter what the hour, and recopy his

06:52.945 --> 07:06.142
notes such that you could read them. It was almost 
like reading a typewriter. I was not that

07:09.767 --> 07:14.093
disciplined, at least as a scholar. But Robert, 
the reason I mention Robert is that Robert got up

07:14.579 --> 07:21.667
every morning and went to breakfast. So he was one 
of those guys we could always depend on. If the

07:26.954 --> 07:29.757
whole staff wasn't going, he was always there. But 
typically you got up, you started early, got to

07:30.538 --> 07:39.689
chow, and then by the time I got to my senior year, I 
had a light load. I only had 15 hours each semester.

07:44.465 --> 07:50.834
And unlike my early years where I had a lot of lab 
classes, I didn't have as many labs. Mostly I had

07:51.195 --> 07:57.404
liberal arts and journalism classes my senior 
year. So it was a little bit easier to manage

07:57.504 --> 08:01.950
through. But I probably didn't go to class a lot. I 
spent a lot of time in the Commandant's office, in

08:04.293 --> 08:15.010
Hannigan's office, President Rutter's office, 
and in dealing with leadership activities of the

08:04.293 --> 08:15.010
Corps.

08:18.375 --> 08:23.082
Did you eat most of your three meals a day in the 
dining hall? Yeah, for the most part. I mean, by the

08:24.365 --> 08:30.334
time you got to be a senior, you were getting a 
little tired of the Duncan Hall chow. And so you

08:30.719 --> 08:37.368
would, especially in the spring, you would find 
ways to slide off campus in the evenings a lot of the

08:30.719 --> 08:37.368
time and grab a meal. But for the most part, it was, 
and you were in formation, so you were, you know,

08:37.388 --> 08:49.705
you were actually commanding the evening and noon 
and morning formations. All right, and it was

08:49.845 --> 08:53.631
expected that you as Corps commander be present 
for all three of those formations. Well, for the

08:53.651 --> 08:54.472
most part. I wasn't there for all of them. But, I 
mean, you always had someone. If you weren't, you

08:57.396 --> 09:00.540
had to make sure there was somebody to stand in 
and... take the review as you look on that back on

09:00.520 --> 09:22.056
that year what are the most positive events you 
recall well i think it was for me again a small town

09:00.520 --> 09:22.056
country boy it was sort of the awakening to a bigger 
world you know i remember for example i was the

09:00.520 --> 09:22.056
student host of edward teller the infamous 
creator of the, I guess, the hydrogen bomb. And he

09:29.749 --> 09:35.516
was here for Great Issues or SCONA or one of those 
events. And I was the, and you know, I mean, this was

09:35.536 --> 09:42.365
to me a pretty sobering thought. And just being 
involved in essentially, to a great degree,

09:44.047 --> 09:52.397
managing the institution from a student 
standpoint. It was, again, a real eye opening. I

09:58.126 --> 10:07.112
don't know, you don't go from being a small town 
country boy one day to being a cosmopolitan,

09:58.126 --> 10:07.112
urbane person the next, but it was this it was 
probably as profound a changing experience for me

10:07.413 --> 10:12.919
as I could ever have. Still having, you know, 
plenty of fun and camaraderie and, you know, being

10:14.841 --> 10:31.741
around friends and doing student things, but it 
was, you know, you became a, you really became a

10:14.841 --> 10:31.741
grown-up in real ways during that year. One of the 
interesting negatives is that a reminder again,

10:36.067 --> 11:03.488
we were in the Vietnam era, so there was sort of a, I 
didn't think about it so much at the time because it

10:36.067 --> 11:03.488
was sick humor or it was just a way to survive it 
because the stories ran through the dormitory

10:36.067 --> 11:03.488
about people that you knew that were there and what 
was happening to them and the forecasted life

10:36.067 --> 11:03.488
expectancy of a second lieutenant in battle and 
that kind of thing. But there was a bit of a pall on

11:05.750 --> 11:09.935
the Corps in those days, because the expectation 
was. And sort of a theme song was, what the hell are

11:09.996 --> 11:14.201
they gonna do, send me to Vietnam? I mean, 
everybody knew. The minute you got your

11:15.363 --> 11:23.954
commission and as soon as you got through with a bit 
of orientation training in the Army, you were

11:15.363 --> 11:23.954
going. So it was a, interesting and maturing time 
but also a very sobering and uh sort of uh uh you know

11:26.894 --> 11:51.315
strange time around the place i asked this one with 
this great face what kind of protest anti-war

11:26.894 --> 11:51.315
protest did y'all have to cope with the one i 
remember best was i remember i told you about that

11:26.894 --> 11:51.315
summer that my friend and i stayed here well the 
word filtered through the dorms that there was a

11:52.358 --> 12:02.951
SDS organizer from Austin coming to the campus and 
that wanted to be sure everybody in the dorms knew

11:52.358 --> 12:02.951
this was happening. You know, sort of implying 
that we would all want to go out and hear what he had

12:03.192 --> 12:07.037
to say. Well, sure enough, the guy did show up and he 
was at Hensel Park and that old strange looking

12:07.858 --> 12:16.729
white pavilion thing that was built over there. He 
got about three or four words out of his mouth and

12:20.135 --> 12:28.963
all of a sudden he was on the tops of a set of thousand 
hands being literally carried to the city limits.

12:30.164 --> 12:48.741
I will to this day believe that probably either 
Earl Rudder or Hannigan or Bob Melcher, who was

12:30.164 --> 12:48.741
sort of a, Bob was a guy of some intrigue, had gotten 
the word out about this organizer coming and knew

12:49.227 --> 12:51.595
exactly what would happen. Because the place was 
very, you know, we were completely out of sync with

12:52.257 --> 13:03.051
what was happening in the rest of the world. I can 
remember sitting in my dorm room and hearing I Want

13:03.605 --> 13:11.395
to Hold Your Hand sung by the Beatles the first 
time. That was in 63 or 64. By the time I got to be a

13:14.799 --> 13:21.388
senior in the corps, the rest of the world were 
smoking dope and wearing flowers in their hair. We

13:22.870 --> 13:27.756
didn't even see it, hardly. On the matter of drugs, 
were you aware of any A&M kids smoking anything?

13:36.804 --> 13:37.065
Never. Never smelled the stuff until I got to 
Vietnam. Did, were you and your buddies even aware

13:41.877 --> 13:47.189
of the words cocaine? No. And crack? No. You know, a 
heroin addict was someone who was the absolute

13:50.356 --> 13:56.490
lowest depths of society. And actually my wife, 
North Texas was a party school in those days, and my

14:00.625 --> 14:08.400
wife became aware of the marijuana stuff while she 
was up there. But I never knew about it, other than

14:08.901 --> 14:14.832
just what you might read or see. During that year as 
court commander, did you have to cope with any

14:14.993 --> 14:22.026
tragedies here?

14:24.318 --> 14:30.505
One of the, you know, this is, I'll tell you a little 
bit about how much the place has changed. We had a

14:30.525 --> 14:39.896
fella named Sammy Green, who I believe was the 
first black to be commissioned from A&M. And Sammy

14:39.917 --> 14:43.581
came into the Corps as a junior, I think. Sammy was 
not the brightest bulb and not the best soldier,

14:45.924 --> 14:52.992
and as a result, That plus his race, he kept being 
harassed.

15:02.123 --> 15:04.386
And it was in good humor, but it wasn't. I mean, it 
was because, I mean, here's one of the first

15:04.566 --> 15:09.972
minorities other than Hispanic. Hispanics were 
widely accepted in a part of the core culture.

15:15.299 --> 15:16.000
Blacks were not. But Rutter called me one day and 
called me over to his office, and he was... My

15:23.363 --> 15:27.188
senior year, I had a phone in the room because I was 
corps commander. And when it rang, I usually knew

15:27.208 --> 15:30.572
who was calling. And he didn't go through the chain 
of command. The chain of command was Rutter to

15:32.114 --> 15:34.016
Davis. Cadet Davis, come to my, or Eddie Joe, I 
don't know what he said. Come to my office. Yes,

15:39.263 --> 15:39.583
sir. So I show up. And he tells me that Cadet Green 
has been found on the courthouse lawn I'm trying to

15:53.030 --> 15:54.516
remember where it was. It was either Brenham or 
Navasota or I guess Independence. Not

15:58.734 --> 16:02.027
Independence, but Anderson was the county seat. 
Well, that is close, you know, tied to the flagpole

16:03.492 --> 16:09.279
and, again, quote in good humor. But he did say to 
me, if it happens again, I'm going to start with

16:10.080 --> 16:19.151
you, and we're going to wipe them out until we get 
down to wherever it is that this is happening. I

16:19.412 --> 16:21.034
mean, it was very plain and clear. So we had a little 
meeting of all the commanders and made it clear

16:22.035 --> 16:31.947
that Cadet Green was not going to be hauled off in 
his birthday suit again and treated this way.

16:33.682 --> 16:35.524
That's sort of one of the kinds of things. And that 
one. Did it work? Yeah, we didn't. Again, Sammy was

16:38.947 --> 16:48.215
a guy that didn't have a lot to offer, but he was 
there, and as a result of all that, he finally made

16:38.947 --> 16:48.215
it through and I think got commissioned. I'm 
almost sure he did. But we didn't have any more

16:50.377 --> 16:52.418
incidents that I knew of. We probably had a few 
more. I don't remember any other particular

16:55.481 --> 17:00.325
tragedies. We had a lot of... again, controversy 
between the civilian students and the Corps, had a

17:02.774 --> 17:25.282
good friend named

17:02.774 --> 17:25.282
Heaton, a nephew of the infamous Heaton that was 
the registrar, who was the civilian student,

17:02.774 --> 17:25.282
whatever we called it, president of the civilian 
student body. And he and I were friends and had been

17:25.803 --> 17:30.148
friends for a long time, and so it was One of the 
things we worked on a lot was that relationship and

17:30.567 --> 17:35.134
trying to improve it. And I think that paid off 
throughout the year. What was it like to be the

17:39.822 --> 17:43.187
Corps commander for a Corps trip? Well, now that 
was really magic. I mean, you think about...

17:48.117 --> 17:57.946
staring down the streets of Congress Avenue, or in 
the case of Dallas, I guess it was Maine or Elm, I

17:48.117 --> 17:57.946
don't remember. But to lead the Corps cadets on a 
major Corps trip was quite a... How did you feel?

18:05.773 --> 18:08.215
Oh, you tingled all over. And how were Aggies 
treated by the observers? You know, the people

18:15.342 --> 18:16.403
were... The people that turned out for that Corps 
trip, and there were a lot of them in those days. I

18:20.692 --> 18:25.876
had an old aunt from Wichita Falls who was really a 
great, great aunt. And she came, she drove with her

18:26.497 --> 18:35.805
husband in a big Chrysler all the way from Wichita 
Falls to Dallas to see Eddie Joe lead the Corps of

18:26.497 --> 18:35.805
Cadets. And it was, you know, I mean, you had that 
coming from all over the state. And then the people

18:38.768 --> 18:40.450
that were locals would turn up. Where did you stay? 
Do you remember? I believe at the Adolphus. All

18:46.471 --> 18:47.554
right. And all the members of the Corps paid for 
their own accommodations? You just found your own

18:51.384 --> 18:52.527
way. There was no organization to it except where 
you showed up, the place to arrive and begin the

18:52.567 --> 19:01.611
parade. I don't remember for sure, but I believe 
the Adolphus by that time was kind of a rundown old

19:01.591 --> 19:07.256
hotel in Dallas. And there was a court trip party at 
the Adolphus. So I think that's where I stayed. And

19:12.020 --> 19:14.983
the marches began at 10 o'clock or so? Yeah, it 
depends on when the game was. But in those days,

19:17.004 --> 19:21.168
most of the games were standard time, like 2 
o'clock in the afternoon. So the parade would have

19:21.749 --> 19:24.871
started at 9 or 10 in the morning. Describe Earl 
Rudder as you saw him as corps commander. You know,

19:32.860 --> 19:37.808
it's hard for me to do that without reflecting on 
what I know about him now. And before I talk about

19:37.848 --> 19:43.738
Rutter, I want to talk about Hannigan a little bit. 
Because Jim Hannigan was a guy that we all, you

19:43.778 --> 19:53.113
know, if you ever went to Hannigan's office, it was 
too late. you were on your way out, or you were maybe

19:53.853 --> 20:03.618
out of the Corps, because it all got dealt with 
pretty much before you got to him. And as a result of

20:04.922 --> 20:06.225
that, Hannigan was feared and was viewed as a, oh I 
don't know, sort of a stoic, tough general.

20:20.176 --> 20:24.923
I got to know him as I came back to work here not long 
after being a student, five years and he was one of

20:24.903 --> 20:31.875
the kindest, gentlest, most down to earth guys 
I've ever known. And I dearly developed a great

20:31.895 --> 20:40.750
admiration for him, but never did that as a student 
because I didn't see that side of him. Rutter a lot

20:40.770 --> 20:42.333
the same way I would guess. Rutter was a again a guy 
that was very firm, very, he had a sense of humor,

20:46.283 --> 20:58.632
but it wasn't easy as a cadet to, you know, find it. I 
remember my interview with him. when this was, you

21:01.960 --> 21:08.968
know the selections basically had been made by 
everybody and he had to be the final check off. So I

21:08.988 --> 21:19.119
go up to his office, Nelda Green, my old friend was 
then Nelda Rowell, was in an office that I would

21:08.988 --> 21:19.119
later occupy as deputy chancellor. But you know, 
you keep your nose clean and in a few years you make

21:19.960 --> 21:23.064
good. But anyway, Nelda always made you feel 
comfortable and sort of warm and nice. And I went

21:29.703 --> 21:32.346
into his office, and he was still on the phone. She 
took me in, and she just said, sit down. And so he

21:34.909 --> 21:36.071
pointed at the chair. And he got off the phone, and 
he stood up, shook hands, and he said, Eddie Joe,

21:36.932 --> 21:47.485
you've been recommended to be the corps 
commander. He said, you're a fine looking young

21:48.326 --> 21:49.908
man. I just have one question for you. And I said, 
yes, sir. What's that, Mr. Rutter? He said, are you

21:54.974 --> 21:59.119
tough enough?

21:59.909 --> 22:03.794
Pretty tough question for a 20-year-old cadet. 
And I said, well, Mr. Rutter, I'm as tough as I need

22:03.874 --> 22:07.479
to be. Whatever it takes to get the job done, I'll 
do. He said, that's all I need to hear. And then we

22:14.428 --> 22:19.395
chit-chatted, talked about a lot of things that 
were going on. And he was warm and friendly and very

22:19.475 --> 22:26.885
much enjoyed it. I've had some other occasions 
when I was called to his office. It wasn't so warm

22:31.123 --> 22:32.405
and friendly. During that year? No, no, that was my 
junior year. No, no, no, but during your year as

22:36.349 --> 22:38.551
Corps Commander. Oh, absolutely. Sammy Green 
would have been an example. I mean, there wasn't

22:41.395 --> 22:43.076
any question. I mean, it was clear when I left there 
what I had to do. And, you know, he made it clear. And

22:51.145 --> 22:54.108
as I said, chain of command was not in his 
vocabulary. If there was an issue going on with the

22:54.529 --> 22:58.333
Corps, now he would obviously Denzel Baker, the 
commandant, would know about it and was involved

22:58.651 --> 23:09.024
in it, but he fired that shot right down to the 
corner room in dorm two and expected me to take care

22:58.651 --> 23:09.024
of it. If you needed any advice about how to respond 
to one of his, to whom did you turn? Well, there were

23:16.834 --> 23:18.356
a couple of places. There were two guys in the 
commandant's office in those days. One was a guy

23:25.144 --> 23:26.666
named Ken Nicholas. Frank K, I guess, but went by 
Nick. He was a retired sergeant major from the Army

23:33.185 --> 23:40.393
and stayed on there as sort of an administrative 
assistant or whatever. And Nick was a guy that you

23:42.074 --> 23:46.058
could go close the door and sit down and talk to. And 
there was another guy named Lieutenant Colonel

23:46.099 --> 23:59.252
Brooks, who I don't remember whether he was an 
active duty officer or a reservist, but he

23:46.099 --> 23:59.252
likewise was a guy If you got in a box and you didn't 
want to go talk to Denzel Baker because you knew you

23:59.654 --> 24:09.606
probably would be in the box with him, you go talk to 
one of those two guys, they'd give you good advice.

24:11.068 --> 24:15.714
So that was, and there were a few other places 
around the campus in those days. Joe Buser was, I

24:17.877 --> 24:28.750
guess, editor of the Texas Aggie, and Buck Wirus 
was the Association of Former Students head. And

24:28.730 --> 24:46.353
Ed Cooper was the assistant to the president, and 
you know on sort of campus politics issues and

24:28.730 --> 24:46.353
things like that that were testy, I could go sit 
down with one of those guys and get some pretty good

24:28.730 --> 24:46.353
advice.

24:49.137 --> 24:51.480
I remember Buser and Wiris both probably pulled my 
fat out of the fire a number of times. Now,

24:56.286 --> 25:09.282
interestingly, and this might surprise you a 
little bit, but Wayne Stark was not one of my real

24:56.286 --> 25:09.282
mentors or confidants. Wayne was a guy who, Wayne 
was very good at picking people out and sort of

25:09.302 --> 25:17.311
saying, you know, I think he's got the stuff. And I 
was one of those. But Wayne had done a thing or two

25:20.722 --> 25:23.848
that didn't sit well with me. One was he criticized 
one of my best friends about deciding to marry a

25:24.068 --> 25:30.039
girl and said that she was beneath him. And, you 
know, this was really not. But you knew Wayne well

25:32.283 --> 25:38.133
enough to know that he would be that 
straightforward and honest. But he was not a guy

25:39.556 --> 25:43.523
that I would go sit down with necessarily. and 
share with. Later, after I left, as I said, he

25:47.211 --> 25:52.723
dogged me until I finally agreed to apply to go to 
business school. And I have a very high regard for

25:53.705 --> 26:02.625
him, but he was not one that, Dick Potts was another 
guy that I could always trust to get good advice

25:53.705 --> 26:02.625
from. would not let me out of Genetics 301, but he 
did give me good advice. And there were probably a

26:10.732 --> 26:13.841
number of others that I just, that don't come to 
mind. But around the campus, There were always a

26:16.561 --> 26:28.402
lot of, in those days, and they were mostly 
faculty, some involved in student

26:16.561 --> 26:28.402
organizations, but mostly faculty that you could 
always call on to get good advice. Now, the Corps

26:30.926 --> 26:35.494
commander in those days got no compensation, did 
he? No scholarship? No, no, no. There was a

26:40.726 --> 26:44.671
Commander's pay, I think it was $10 a month. What 
you got there was for handing out the keys and

26:47.155 --> 26:52.883
taking up the keys and making sure people's room 
was sandwiched, whatever all that was. There was a

26:53.824 --> 26:58.290
little sweetener to your pay. Was there any good 
bull prank played on you by your old buddies when

26:58.731 --> 27:04.178
they learned you'd been selected as Corps 
Commander? Oh, yes. Describe it. We have to do this

27:05.921 --> 27:08.885
on tape. If it is tapeable. Well, I lived in the 
Speza area my junior year, so we were at Chow, and

27:10.882 --> 27:22.073
announcements were made, and it was announced who 
the new corps commander was gonna be. Well, I was on

27:22.974 --> 27:36.248
the tops of a lot of hands on my way to the fish pond, 
thrown in the fish pond, and then taken back to my

27:22.974 --> 27:36.248
dorm, and we had a ceremony that's rather, 
Byzantine now, but they shaved you in places that

27:37.308 --> 27:44.187
you shouldn't be shaved, which made it very 
uncomfortable at summer camp. But that was the

27:44.308 --> 27:45.992
ritual. And as far as you knew, you were not the 
first one? Oh, heavens no. To have that? And for

27:52.310 --> 27:56.599
reasons of survival, you were very still.

28:01.609 --> 28:02.110
Let's see. I'm now looking at campus activities 
and so forth. Was Guyon Hall still an important

28:09.325 --> 28:12.411
place for Yeah, you know, you went there to watch 
We've Never Been Licked, and you went there for

28:13.437 --> 28:26.830
major assemblies, like the Bevo Assembly, and the 
first one you first got to school, you know, to be

28:13.437 --> 28:26.830
told nobody would be left when you got through. 
Yeah, it was a place. It was pretty craggy in those

28:28.972 --> 28:31.975
days. They used to have the Cotton Pageant, which 
was a big event, you know, where women would be

28:32.556 --> 28:43.326
imported from various places around the state and 
be candidates for the Cotton Queen, I think is what

28:32.556 --> 28:43.326
it was called. So that was, and you know, usually as 
a student in agriculture, you were involved even

28:43.846 --> 28:58.710
early on in that and hosting people and trying to 
get lucky enough to find one of those pretty ones

28:43.846 --> 28:58.710
to, you know, escort. Now you met this special 
young lady when you were a junior? Junior. And when

29:03.097 --> 29:06.082
she came down here, where did she spend the night? 
Where did she stay? Well, you know, that first trip

29:08.973 --> 29:11.297
I don't even remember. I think maybe she might have 
stayed with her parents in Marlin, you know, gone

29:11.317 --> 29:19.010
back to Marlin. The second trip, though, I invited 
her at the end of that visit to come back for the

29:20.513 --> 29:32.533
combat and military ball weekend. and she stayed 
at the Sabre Motel. I had two guys, two fish in my

29:38.825 --> 29:50.488
outfit, Fish Harvey and Fish Mac Frazier, who 
played the guitar and sang to come over and be in the

29:50.468 --> 29:55.473
room when she arrived to serenade her. And she 
still, they still, and she still remembers that

29:56.755 --> 29:59.958
event. All right, now this sounds like that you 
began to feel this was serious pretty quickly.

30:06.686 --> 30:07.907
Well, she was pretty special. You know, and I was 
trying to save her from all those strange people up

30:09.388 --> 30:12.432
in North Texas. There you go, there you go. Her 
brother was an Aggie, class of 62, and he was a

30:13.739 --> 30:20.110
little worried about her as well. And when he found 
out she had a date with an Aggie, he was

30:20.130 --> 30:23.175
encouraging. How were young women at an A&M social 
event, a dance or a football game, in fact, how were

30:23.816 --> 30:32.230
they treated by Aggies? I would say they were 
treated like princesses, which is just the way you

30:32.530 --> 30:40.303
would expect to be treated.

30:41.228 --> 30:49.028
having not seen it from that side it's hard for me to 
imagine but it must have been a wonderful

30:41.228 --> 30:49.028
experience for a young woman to come here and be see 
all these guys in uniforms which we saw every day

30:50.223 --> 31:15.893
but to them it must have been quite special and you 
know just being treated and you always had a

30:50.223 --> 31:15.893
corsage you always you know you put on the dog and 
you did everything you could do within reason and

30:50.223 --> 31:15.893
brand college station to make them feel special 
and welcome if i were to ask your wife about how she

30:50.223 --> 31:15.893
felt they were treated do you think she would 
concur
