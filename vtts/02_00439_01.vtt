WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:10.504
Okay,

00:00.031 --> 00:10.504
my name is Denny Tudus and today is April the 5th, 
1986. And I'm going to interview my uncle, Raleigh

00:12.267 --> 00:15.871
Brotherman III. And

00:15.911 --> 00:27.426
we're just going to go over Vietnam, when he was 
there, what he did, and just a basic interview.

00:27.446 --> 00:29.228
This is prepared for Terry Anderson. History 489, 
Texas A&M University. Okay, my first question is

00:34.555 --> 00:38.559
when did you go to Vietnam? In September of 68. 
September of 68, which would be right around the

00:41.922 --> 00:46.726
Tet Offensive. And were you drafted or did you 
enlist? No, I enlisted in the Air Force in 66. Okay,

00:55.534 --> 00:59.097
and when you went to Vietnam, what was your rank? 
Sergeant. Sergeant, okay. Okay, once you arrived

01:01.960 --> 01:05.725
in Vietnam, what was your job? I was in what they 
call the military airlift command and it was air

01:06.406 --> 01:14.198
passenger service. It was my career field and

01:14.218 --> 01:23.211
I was stationed at Cam Ranh Bay primarily. Our main 
function was to get troops in and out of the country

01:29.333 --> 01:35.262
And then once they were in the country, to move them 
around the smaller aircraft. And our job was to set

01:37.024 --> 01:46.298
up the different airfields

01:37.024 --> 01:46.298
and keep them secured for in-country travel.

01:49.022 --> 01:55.932
And also manage the in and out ports like Cameron 
Bay and Saigon and Da Nang. Is this I Corps 3? No, I

02:03.986 --> 02:05.769
was in 2 Corps. I spent most of my time in 2 Corps. 
Cameron was my home base, but we went out to little

02:07.812 --> 02:17.288
places like Nha Trang and

02:07.812 --> 02:17.288
Pleiku. Pleiku was around here.

02:23.384 --> 02:32.196
A little bitty handlets in the area for the smaller 
aircraft like the C-123 and C-130s. And the

02:32.296 --> 02:40.747
lock is not too far from there. I can't even think of 
it. That's sort of a rough draft of a map. But the

02:48.157 --> 02:52.463
whole idea was for us to keep track of who was where.

03:00.447 --> 03:09.256
It was air transportation for all the services at 
that time and civilians.

03:10.897 --> 03:12.860
Were y'all ever in combat? We were 
non-combatants, but we were armed when we were

03:13.260 --> 03:19.486
away from Cameron. Cameron was such a big, secure 
base In the Air Force wisdom, they felt like we

03:23.257 --> 03:25.700
shouldn't be armed. We'd probably kill each 
other. Watch the airmen run around with rifles.

03:35.032 --> 03:38.857
When we left the base to go into the field, we were 
always armed. Any combat we were in was primarily

03:40.559 --> 03:50.952
just defensive because whenever it was dark,

03:40.559 --> 03:50.952
Charlie would come out. It was harassment fire 
from rocket attacks and stuff like that. And a

03:55.558 --> 04:02.509
couple of times they got into Cameron or rocketed 
Cameron and just tear up our runway a little bit and

03:55.558 --> 04:02.509
go away. But it was a few anxious moments. But we 
weren't out physically looking for Charlie. He

04:09.539 --> 04:12.924
was always trying to mess up our little party. So 
you were pretty lucky as far as that's concerned.

04:19.265 --> 04:22.028
You're fortunate enough not to be there.

04:25.951 --> 04:30.976
Do you think that we belonged there at the time? 
Yeah, we pretty much committed ourselves to the

04:31.437 --> 04:48.833
domino theory that if Vietnam fell then

04:31.437 --> 04:48.833
Cambodia and Laos and everybody else would go with 
it, would fall into communism. So we felt like we

04:49.454 --> 04:54.679
needed to be there to stem the red tide. But did you 
think that we should have declared war? Because

05:00.865 --> 05:05.770
there's always the gripes of limited power of 
Congress. It was always considered a police

05:05.790 --> 05:09.494
action.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.419
But when you're over there, you don't think in 
terms of police action. You always think you are at

05:14.439 --> 05:15.660
war. It was always a war to us. And we were just under 
the assumption that we were there to win the war.

05:23.758 --> 05:30.306
And all these artificial constraints that were 
put on us. Do you consider yourself as a hawk or a

05:32.008 --> 05:34.491
dove? Well at the time by definition I would have 
been a hawk because I

05:34.712 --> 05:49.870
wanted to be there and I didn't see any benefit to 
the peace movement Because in my estimation, it

05:51.470 --> 05:57.199
was not a peace movement, it was just a good excuse 
to smoke dope. Yeah. Lots of that. That's what I was

05:59.021 --> 06:04.249
going to ask you about, you know, drugs over there 
played an important role towards the later years.

06:04.269 --> 06:11.220
Probably because it probably cost us the war, 
among other things, that the... Fragging. That

06:11.280 --> 06:14.264
dope was just all over the place. Uh-huh. And it was 
my theory that that the Red Chinese, at least, were

06:21.322 --> 06:28.352
smart enough to keep that dope coming. And that was 
because that was their best weapon, to keep the

06:28.572 --> 06:38.967
American guys high and disoriented to the point 
where they could just walk right over it. Yeah,

06:39.007 --> 06:39.948
they didn't care. That's interesting. I think 
that a lot of the officers that were sent there were

06:44.094 --> 06:50.603
so gung-ho, and we've read several accounts, And 
in the readings that we've had, that some of these

06:51.190 --> 07:01.684
green officers went and the tour of duty was only, 
you know, what, 12 months, 18 months? 12 months.

07:02.525 --> 07:04.768
And 12 months isn't enough time. You know, once 
you've gone through nine months, you just have

07:04.828 --> 07:11.657
three months left to serve and you're not going to 
risk your life for anybody or anyone. But when the

07:12.178 --> 07:17.805
green lieutenants and what have you would arrive, 
they'd be so gun-ho. And their troops wouldn't,

07:18.663 --> 07:21.407
you know, they'd be short timers. Towards the end 
of the war, a lot of fragging occurred where people

07:22.588 --> 07:32.662
that may have been on drugs were killing their 
officers just for the sake of saving their own

07:22.588 --> 07:32.662
lives, I guess. It's pretty, I don't know. Yeah, 
it's pretty bizarre in the field where, because

07:35.766 --> 07:42.595
we've, and pulling these guys out on the field, 
they were almost hardly recognizable as human

07:43.469 --> 07:50.560
beings. Of course, by contrast, we were a little, I 
guess, since we had it, much better.

08:03.539 --> 08:08.667
We were at least modestly clean, and these guys 
were coming up with this absolutely And you could

08:10.739 --> 08:30.400
tell that they lost their, a lot of their human 
instincts or just the human social ability

08:10.739 --> 08:30.400
because they were just, they had experienced so 
much and had just been in, for months of just being

08:10.739 --> 08:30.400
in the filth and... Plus their resources. And 
whatever they've seen, they've just gone to, what

08:30.420 --> 08:38.468
I'm trying to get at is that they had gotten their 
more baser instincts, more animalistic, And it

08:39.190 --> 08:51.046
wouldn't surprise me if a lot of guys got wiped out 
because somebody looked off to somebody and it was

08:39.190 --> 08:51.046
just convenient, the person was conveniently 
disposed of. And I'm sure once they got back to the

08:52.668 --> 09:06.767
States that they got, a lot of them turned away from 
that because they were away from that hostile

08:52.668 --> 09:06.767
environment, or the primitive environment. 
Plus, they're so young. The average age was 19. We

09:11.846 --> 09:13.107
had warrant officers. The Army promoted their 
guys

09:13.127 --> 09:35.607
so fast that they had captains that were 
helicopter or gunship pilots in the Army that had

09:13.127 --> 09:35.607
to be in their early 20s, early, early 20s. And they 
just, they were barely, you know, old enough to be

09:36.312 --> 09:42.141
flying an aircraft. Must have been held up from 
enlistee or craftee to captain. Not even old

09:48.571 --> 09:50.614
enough to shave in a lot of cases.

09:54.360 --> 10:02.252
How do you think LBJ, whose administration was in 
charge while you were there, how do you think he

09:54.360 --> 10:02.252
handled the war? I kind of think LBJ would have 
wanted us to win this thing. I've never had real

10:05.923 --> 10:11.969
high esteem for LBJ, but he may have been too much of 
a diplomat.

10:15.813 --> 10:17.795
You think he was involved too deeply? You think he 
should have let Westmoreland run the show more so

10:17.815 --> 10:23.441
than he did? Well, his administration, his House 
and Senate ran the war. Westmoreland, I don't

10:27.285 --> 10:31.429
think, had that much to say about it. Either 
Johnson, not Johnson personally, but the

10:31.814 --> 10:40.726
government, the U.S. Congress held us back way too 
much. Kept their heel on us and would not let the Air

10:41.367 --> 10:47.416
Force and Marines do their job. And there have been 
a lot fewer deaths. And a lot fewer men of our guys in

10:56.519 --> 11:15.146
the field if we could have had more of an air war and 
more

10:56.519 --> 11:15.146
of a... We could have bombed the place to oblivion 
if we really wanted to win the war in just a matter of

10:56.519 --> 11:15.146
minutes. But all that we ended up doing is just 
sending young guys out there to die in sort of a war

11:15.166 --> 11:22.798
of attrition. Do you think we should have bombed 
the cities? instead of staying into bombing the Ho

11:25.544 --> 11:30.591
Chi Minh Trail and the borders? I don't know that we 
should have gone in and deliberately looked to

11:31.773 --> 11:37.101
wipe out entire cities. Civilians, whatever. 
Because our whole idea was to

11:38.543 --> 11:45.914
do more than stem their supply lines. And we

11:46.154 --> 11:54.707
need to do it. attack that angle of it, the supply 
lines, to the Ho Chi Minh Trail. But also, we never

12:00.555 --> 12:14.468
seemed to really get interested in the tunnel 
network that was all under Vietnam that we now find

12:00.555 --> 12:14.468
out was just very pervading that we went 
everywhere in Vietnam. It was like fighting a

12:14.708 --> 12:18.912
bunch of ants, if that's what they were referred 
to. These people were so...

12:22.855 --> 12:24.897
These people have been at war for so long that they 
know the tricks and they kind of revert, like I said

12:26.480 --> 12:41.839
before, back to their, to an animalistic state 
because they can survive for months underground

12:26.480 --> 12:41.839
and got up in trees and wherever else if you want. 
You wouldn't even be looking for a human being. And

12:45.463 --> 12:49.048
they, we were fighting on their turf right in their 
backyard. They knew where everything was. And

12:52.292 --> 12:55.035
until we got into a real, take-no-prisoners, 
kick-ass-and-take-names attitude, we weren't

12:57.091 --> 13:07.085
about to win that war. The take-no-prisoners 
reminds me of body counts. You would tend to agree,

13:13.594 --> 13:18.441
I imagine, that the body counts were false. always 
incorrect well that's all come out now it's uh

13:19.467 --> 13:48.445
everything was so much was

13:19.467 --> 13:48.445
i i'm busy

13:19.467 --> 13:48.445
so much of so much emphasis was put on body count and 
uh where i was on the beach and stuff whenever we'd

13:19.467 --> 13:48.445
uh Whenever we would be invaded,

13:49.606 --> 14:01.324
it was just to see all the bodies piled up and 
burning or whatever it is. Then somebody over

14:02.586 --> 14:13.143
there trying to get a good accurate estimate of how 
many bodies were taken as compared to how many of

14:02.586 --> 14:13.143
our lives were lost. Usually in our area, we were so 
well We didn't lose anybody.

14:21.964 --> 14:24.247
You're lucky to be protected, that's for sure. 
Okay, were you aware of any of the pacification

14:25.368 --> 14:30.073
programs? The pacification programs pretty much 
ran up through 68 through 69, and after Tet, they

14:43.724 --> 14:45.466
pretty much fell to pieces. And by pacification, I 
mean the strategic hamlets and all of these

14:45.586 --> 14:55.257
different programs that were set up to win the 
hearts and minds of the Vietnamese. Or wham,

14:57.239 --> 15:02.585
whammam, as it's referred to in lots of books. I 
guess I'm totally ignorant of that program. OK. I

15:05.348 --> 15:08.932
had no idea it was going on as such. You know, the 
strategic hamlets, they were building. hamlets

15:13.677 --> 15:15.939
for the Vietnamese to live in. They had to live 
there at night. They were totally removed from

15:19.763 --> 15:30.555
their ancestral lands, put in little 
encampments, which we'd call basically a

15:19.763 --> 15:30.555
reservation, kind of if you look back to how the 
Indians were treated. They were corralled,

15:31.095 --> 15:35.640
placed in these hamlets, were guarded. And if they 
were seen outside of the hamlet's perimeter at

15:35.660 --> 15:39.944
night, they were shot. They were considered VC. I 
don't see how you can win the hearts and minds of

15:41.842 --> 15:48.233
someone when you're constraining them so much. 
But you weren't aware of any of this? Well, if

15:50.837 --> 15:56.627
that's what was the little village outside of Cam 
Ranh was supposed to be, It was for obvious reasons

15:58.666 --> 16:07.315
why somebody approached the village after 
nightfall. It was assumed that they were hostile.

16:11.039 --> 16:13.862
And that was pretty much the way everybody had to 
be. Because

16:15.244 --> 16:23.172
with the problem of cross-racial 
identification, There's not going to be any

16:24.097 --> 16:30.227
American soldier who's going to know which 
Vietnamese is good or bad. So we had to take, like in

16:31.610 --> 16:42.127
our encampment in Cam Ranh,

16:31.610 --> 16:42.127
the Koreans were right next to us.

16:45.573 --> 16:49.159
And they guarded, and we guarded the bay. And it was 
just an

16:51.181 --> 17:12.627
unwritten law that if the sampans came in at night 
beyond a certain point, or in the daytime, it

16:51.181 --> 17:12.627
doesn't matter, it was sort of like Gaddafi's line 
of death. You came in too far, you were going to get

17:13.247 --> 17:15.891
blown out of the water. And then you were a dead man. 
And they knew that. They were out there fishing.

17:22.763 --> 17:23.784
They were supposed to be out there fishing. They 
were not to come to shore. Or on our turf, so to

17:27.490 --> 17:31.416
speak. And they were just... Everybody knew that 
they got... And they were just... Every day,

17:31.436 --> 17:37.125
somebody would get blown out of the water. Because 
they got too close. Because they got too close. And

17:40.410 --> 17:44.837
that was... And everybody had to understand that 
we were at war. And their own personal... little

17:50.193 --> 17:56.908
inconveniences could not be taken into 
consideration because we don't know who they are.

18:01.699 --> 18:04.205
Do you think the media played an important role in 
the war? Yes, they did. They created such a an

18:08.738 --> 18:12.062
anti-war sentiment, and such an anti-G.I. 
sentiment. And every night you could see what

18:14.966 --> 18:22.796
happened during the day in Vietnam, or in David. 
David Ford. David Ford. And created such a hostile

18:26.380 --> 18:31.607
environment toward

18:33.697 --> 18:54.118
our winning the war or our being there that we never 
had a chance to build up a national spirit

18:33.697 --> 18:54.118
well the national spirit was there at first it just 
it uh dissipated after after tet when when we saw

18:33.697 --> 18:54.118
that we weren't winning the war like everybody 
assumed That's when the kids at home became more

18:55.668 --> 19:01.494
aggressive? I don't know that we ever had. I can go 
back to when I first started hearing about Vietnam

19:03.116 --> 19:09.082
as a possible place for me to go. It was in high 
school when I was 63 or so. People were already

19:13.546 --> 19:18.992
going to Vietnam, Marines and stuff like that, and 
people like that. Not knowing that we'd been there

19:20.253 --> 19:23.937
since the 50s, or actually never. Yes, it's an 
advisory capacity. And people are already

19:28.360 --> 19:32.065
starting to go there and die. And there was never 
the feeling that, like, I'm sure that soldiers or

19:33.487 --> 19:49.127
young men got during the World War II era, where it 
was really a good thing to go do this. That we were

19:50.348 --> 19:54.193
fighting for a good cause. And

19:55.118 --> 20:19.082
I attribute that to the way that the media handled 
it and the peace movement

19:55.118 --> 20:19.082
and just the liberal attitude that the media has 
had at that point and continues to this day.

20:19.102 --> 20:22.425
That we can't get into a conflict without first 
checking with the media to make sure it's all right

20:22.777 --> 20:27.622
with them. They want to be involved in everything 
and they want to downplay the...

20:34.270 --> 20:35.591
The military as well. They're just trying to make 
us look like fools and like really bad guys because

20:36.112 --> 20:48.566
we were just trying to practice basic survival.

20:48.586 --> 20:51.990
And there was nothing that the GIs could get 
excited about. It

20:54.471 --> 21:04.643
was just that they were going to try to do anything 
that good to stay alive. They were not fighting for

21:04.683 --> 21:10.329
their country.

21:10.530 --> 21:19.260
So the media showed the students at home that, hey, 
this isn't where you want to be. You think that they

21:19.966 --> 21:49.720
don't want to support that the people at home, 
after seeing some of these clips and newsreels and

21:19.966 --> 21:49.720
hearing Walter Cronkite and Morley Safer and Keys 
Beach and all these other guys that were sending

21:19.966 --> 21:49.720
back messages or clips of film, you think that 
these little reels that were sent home made the

21:19.966 --> 21:49.720
people here, students, young high school and 
college age kids, feel that it wasn't something

21:19.966 --> 21:49.720
that they would want to participate in? No. They

21:51.276 --> 22:01.248
really, it was a very, very ugly war by the very 
nature of guerrilla warfare. It's just absolute.

22:05.834 --> 22:14.325
The atrocities and the things that we do to

22:05.834 --> 22:14.325
kill and maim people. And then we've met enough 
that it actually happens, but then to portray it on

22:21.627 --> 22:23.630
the silver screen every night. It really, really, 
really preys on people's minds and senses.

22:32.043 --> 22:32.464
Okay. How did you feel when you got back home? Glad 
to be home. Glad to be alive. I didn't feel so much

22:42.460 --> 22:47.668
like that everybody hated me. like I hear today so 
much that some people have a hard time getting over

22:49.133 --> 22:53.540
the war. And I was just glad to be alive. I felt like I 
had aged a hundred years. I'd seen more than I ever

22:59.951 --> 23:02.335
needed to see. But everything was forgotten. It 
was just like once

23:11.493 --> 23:20.903
With the night I left in Cam Ranh, we were back in Cam 
Ranh now, where it was relatively safe, but things

23:11.493 --> 23:20.903
have deteriorated. The whole year I was there, we 
had been in more and more attacks, and the base that

23:22.164 --> 23:40.943
was supposed to be so strong was, we were getting 
satchel charges on every other night, thrown into

23:22.164 --> 23:40.943
everything, and everybody was just on pins and 
needles as to what was gonna blow up next. And the

23:42.526 --> 23:47.130
night I left, we were going, we were on red alert 
again. And I was just thinking, oh God, here I am.

23:51.614 --> 23:54.036
The last night here, we're all going to get blown 
away. And just wait, just wait for the sun to come up

23:54.096 --> 24:01.382
because that seemed to be after like four o'clock 
in the morning. Everything settled down. It's

24:03.604 --> 24:08.749
just like everybody said, well, enough for the 
night, we're going home. But the time came for me to

24:09.910 --> 24:11.571
finally I'd get on the aircraft, or Freedom Bird as 
they call them. Did you go to Japan from there? No,

24:21.202 --> 24:22.804
we went straight on back. I don't think we even 
stopped. It was non-stop. And then once you were

24:26.589 --> 24:32.898
back in the States, you just... Landed at Tacoma, 
Washington.

24:32.918 --> 24:37.044
And

24:32.918 --> 24:37.044
got off the plane. And went over to see... my guys in 
the military airline command section to see if

24:40.525 --> 24:45.670
they could get me on a hop back to San Antonio. A hop 
is a military plane. It's any kind of aircraft

24:49.873 --> 24:56.419
to get back to San Antonio. But you were already out 
of the military as of that point? Oh, no, no, no. I

25:02.104 --> 25:04.806
still had, I had an Air Force have a four-year 
enlistment. Okay. And I had about a year left And so

25:09.635 --> 25:16.324
I was on my 30-day leave, and I was going to the 
Laredo Air Force Base from there. But it was...

25:19.669 --> 25:21.571
Were you glad that you went when you did? Oh sure, I 
was glad to be. I volunteered to go to Vietnam, and I

25:24.235 --> 25:28.060
was sent to Vietnam, probably. And

25:29.161 --> 25:39.135
I figured that I would probably, I had just a good 
chance of making it alive. It does not make it. And

25:43.828 --> 25:50.240
it was a long 365 days or whatever it turned out to 
be. But I got back and it just wasn't, it didn't prey

25:51.843 --> 25:58.255
on my memory that much. Nightmares once in a while, 
there's nothing excruciating it. But you feel

26:02.673 --> 26:09.408
fortunate that you didn't have to get into the, 
say, more of the jungle-type fighting? Oh, yeah,

26:09.448 --> 26:12.014
sure. It could have been really... I think that's 
the way it was just ordained for me, not to be in

26:14.479 --> 26:19.450
the... Because I could have easily been, when I was 
at the draft board, well, when you enlist,

26:21.387 --> 26:30.456
everybody's in all one big room to swear in. The 
draftees, the enlistees, everybody takes the

26:31.136 --> 26:35.000
same oath. And they're all in Army, Navy, Marines. 
And when it's time to split up, we all go our

26:39.204 --> 26:43.208
separate ways. And I could have easily been in with 
that group that were drafted into the Army. And

26:49.450 --> 26:51.633
probably most of those guys are dead. Because 
probably most of them went to... In 66, everybody

26:55.498 --> 26:57.301
got called up. My 2S deferment for school was 
worthless. Unless I was going to do something like

27:02.347 --> 27:07.554
be a doctor or something like that. That would be 
really, really important. So I probably would

27:09.937 --> 27:11.880
have been drafted anyway. And it was better to 
enlist than to be drafted? Yeah, I couldn't help

27:17.109 --> 27:19.011
it. I didn't want to go in the Army. You could pick 
your branch of service. And

27:22.596 --> 27:31.728
an Air Force, I might learn something there.

27:34.371 --> 27:35.893
It wouldn't be just cannon fodder. Well, have you 
kept up with any of the current events? Do you think

27:40.359 --> 27:50.335
that all the Vietnam veterans programs are really 
going to help the vets, like the people that have

27:40.359 --> 27:50.335
suffered from Agent Orange? Yeah, it seems like 
you always hear that. I wondered if I could,

27:52.618 --> 28:01.532
because they use that stuff all the time, this 
pesticide, or antifoliant, and they sprayed the

27:52.618 --> 28:01.532
hell out of us all the time. I wondered if I would... 
But I wonder if we're not making too much of all

28:03.380 --> 28:06.323
that. These

28:06.664 --> 28:15.374
veterans programs, there's obviously a lot of 
guys out there who feel like they've been

28:06.664 --> 28:15.374
slighted.

28:19.338 --> 28:22.021
But there are guys out there who are going to feel 
like they're slighted anyway. So my way of

28:23.543 --> 28:29.910
thinking is it's over and done with.

28:31.865 --> 28:33.568
You've got to go on with your life. You can't just 
keep living in the past all the time. If some of

28:36.813 --> 28:44.146
these guys have real serious mental problems, 
what's it called, delayed syndrome? Vietnam

28:44.166 --> 28:45.288
syndrome. Some kind of post-trust.

28:50.917 --> 28:52.821
Then they should deal with it. And not keep 
dressing up like a... in their fatigues and having

28:56.857 --> 29:26.037
parades because that's just there may be a few guys 
in there who are really really sincere about this

28:56.857 --> 29:26.037
and then the rest of them are just hangers on in 
there to collect on what everybody is going to

28:56.857 --> 29:26.037
collect on so you just assume put it aside and go 
forward we end up in Nicaragua or Israel then hell

28:56.857 --> 29:26.037
let's go let's not keep thinking we're going to to 
hold up Vietnam and Korea and all these other

29:26.793 --> 29:33.121
things as being a history repeating itself. 
They're not the same. It's a different mindset.

29:37.987 --> 29:39.069
Everything is different about it. We have more at 
stake in Nicaragua. I mean, this is pretty close to

29:41.031 --> 29:43.134
us. It's a whole lot closer than Vietnam. People 
say that we shouldn't have lost Vietnam, but

29:46.438 --> 29:55.450
Vietnam didn't mean as much to us, I guess, as 
Nicaragua's going to mean. Fighting the Chinese

29:55.919 --> 29:57.481
is one thing. We're not going to have, you know, we 
couldn't afford to fight the Chinese at that time.

30:04.168 --> 30:06.571
I don't believe. That's one thing about all these 
Rambo movies and all these other, the hell of it is,

30:06.591 --> 30:17.364
we still live, we still lose. No matter what you do, 
and no matter what we say, what we could have done,

30:19.106 --> 30:23.711
we still lost it. Yeah. And so we had to deal with 
that and not lose another

30:25.130 --> 30:33.498
one. But the next time we're involved in 
something, if we do get involved in Nicaragua, you

30:33.798 --> 30:43.888
don't think that for a minute that we're going to 
fight it or make the same mistakes that we made in

30:33.798 --> 30:43.888
Vietnam, do you? I think we better not. I think that 
if we do, I'm moving to some other country. So it's

30:49.814 --> 30:52.977
the... soldier in Vietnam had his tour, his 
12-month tour, I think that'll change, don't you?

31:02.167 --> 31:06.753
Because people in World War II were sent to fight 
and win the war. Yeah, I just recently heard the

31:07.634 --> 31:11.459
rhetoric about that. 12

31:11.479 --> 31:18.247
months is a long time. But I guess the feeling is now 
that In World War II, they kind of just stayed in the

31:24.243 --> 31:30.049
war, like you said, until it was won. And all this 
turnover may have had a deciding effect on the

31:31.270 --> 31:38.597
outcome. I never really thought of it until just 
recently. Well, you'd think if you had put in six

31:43.261 --> 31:52.090
months or nine months of heavy fighting, and then 
all of a sudden you realized you only had, you know,

31:53.470 --> 32:22.600
three more months to go it uh... you'd lose your 
zest for fighting you'd become more kicked back

31:53.470 --> 32:22.600
yeah i guess that's i think korea started that when 
they were on the point system with so many after you

31:53.470 --> 32:22.600
accumulated so many points for for being there for 
maybe some other meritorious actions you got to

31:53.470 --> 32:22.600
leave early leave earlier

32:24.368 --> 32:28.292
I think the attitude should be we stay there until 
it's over. Well, is there anything else that you

32:29.813 --> 32:32.556
could add? What was your rank when you got back? Had 
you advanced at all? I was still a sergeant.

32:41.964 --> 32:47.329
Because in the Air Force, they pretty well, I was a 
sergeant E3. That was the enlisted rank number

32:47.450 --> 32:53.295
three from the bottom. And you didn't come out of 
the Air Force at that time with any higher rank

32:53.900 --> 33:02.256
after four years in E4, or Staff Sergeant. That 
just was sort of the unwritten law. Unless you did

33:05.407 --> 33:13.800
something awfully, awfully, awfully 
meritorious or wonderful, or they wanted you to

33:05.407 --> 33:13.800
reenlist so bad that they would give you an extra 
strike. So by the time I got back to the States, I

33:14.842 --> 33:18.207
ended up a staff sergeant. But it didn't mean 
anything because I was on my way out anyway. But

33:23.055 --> 33:30.387
the rank in the Air Force wasn't as necessary or 
wasn't as changing in the Army, in the Air Force as

33:30.670 --> 33:46.305
it was in the Army, because the Army guys, they were 
losing people, either to death or they're getting

33:30.670 --> 33:46.305
out, because they only had a two-year enlistment. 
So those guys during the wartime experience could

33:46.325 --> 34:00.458
find themselves promoted way ahead of anybody, 
because they just needed ranking people, like the

33:46.325 --> 34:00.458
ones that they lost. Did you think that the black 
market over there was a detriment to our country?

34:07.910 --> 34:12.136
So I know you got a stereo. Didn't you get a stereo 
over there? Oh, no, I bought that in Hong Kong. Oh,

34:15.301 --> 34:15.882
did you really? Okay, I thought... That was all 
legitimate. The only black market that we're

34:18.527 --> 34:24.356
talking about is a... Jeez, you know, we're... If 
somebody could do an exercise...

34:36.871 --> 34:38.313
Sorry about the dog barking. We're just trying to 
take care of that. But we're going to go ahead and

34:40.916 --> 34:42.418
continue. If it ever is known about the civilians

34:43.980 --> 35:02.963
and actually whoever else was involved and all the 
goings on over there with the civilian

34:43.980 --> 35:02.963
contractors and the military and all the goods and 
services that were passed back and forth, You call

35:04.327 --> 35:16.041
it corruption, you call it spoils of war, you call 
it just trying to make things a little bit nicer for

35:04.327 --> 35:16.041
you over there while you're over there. You trade 
an air conditioner for a jeep or a jeep for a

35:17.082 --> 35:22.889
surfboard or something. Whatever you can do to 
make life a little more palatable. That's not

35:27.310 --> 35:30.314
exactly black, black market. When I think of black 
market, I think of all the... People that were

35:30.334 --> 35:34.360
making money. Oh, yeah. That's a very 
lucrative... War is always a lucrative

35:35.943 --> 35:42.172
proposition for somebody. When I think of black 
market, for instance, the dope that went... That

35:42.652 --> 35:51.445
was one place... I only had maybe a few semesters of 
college at that point, so I really wasn't into the

35:51.982 --> 36:05.879
college scene yet, and the dope scene was getting 
pretty well fired up on all the campuses at that

35:51.982 --> 36:05.879
point. And if there's anything that kept me from 
ever really getting, I guess, delivered from

36:06.680 --> 36:16.993
being involved in the dope scene was seeing what 
happens to people who Who were on it. Who were on it

36:19.647 --> 36:24.994
and who were actually, they lost their lives 
because of it. It really wiped out so many guys

36:27.116 --> 36:37.389
because a lot of this marijuana and Cambodian red 
and all that really high-powered stuff that was

36:27.116 --> 36:37.389
over there. Some of it was laced with opium, which 
would kill you. It would get you wasted. But, yeah,

36:42.809 --> 36:48.658
there were some of the guys who were just so 
blitzoid by the time they got back there, they

36:42.809 --> 36:48.658
didn't know who they were. And I made a conscious 
decision at that point, I would never get involved

36:48.678 --> 36:54.688
in this stuff. How come the Army didn't do anything 
about it? It seems like, you know, we've read

36:56.291 --> 37:04.604
articles in our readings that say that everybody 
was aware of it going on, but nothing was done about

36:56.291 --> 37:04.604
it. And you could, if you brought it up, it was just, 
you know, your... you were just put aside, or you

37:10.990 --> 37:22.967
know, whatever comments you made were just, they 
were, you know, they would acknowledge your, you

37:10.990 --> 37:22.967
know, remarks or questions, but they'd never do 
anything about it. To me. Well, of course, the way

37:24.129 --> 37:40.812
anybody took it seriously, you know, they were 
aware of it, because we'd wiped out, our forces had

37:24.129 --> 37:40.812
wiped out VidCon soldiers who were just kind of 
laying around doing the opium thing.

37:45.601 --> 37:49.327
And they were so stoned that they didn't offer any 
resistance. But that's also how they fought a lot

37:49.847 --> 37:52.031
too. They were such militarily superior 
fighters. But sometimes don't you think that they

37:58.520 --> 38:06.613
were just so high that that made them much more of a 
fighting machine? Could be. Because I know if I was

38:08.936 --> 38:13.583
like that, you know, confronted with the... you 
know, war, I think that I wouldn't want to feel any

38:13.850 --> 38:16.634
pain. If I knew I had chances of dying, I wouldn't 
want to feel any pain. Yeah, and there's no telling

38:22.602 --> 38:29.772
how much of that stuff relates with some type of 
poison to kill all of our troops. So that aspect of

38:32.235 --> 38:41.207
the black market existed, and then whatever the 
GIs could make out of selling from the Army Air

38:41.660 --> 38:48.190
Force Exchange Service to the locals, making a few 
bucks here and there.

38:53.739 --> 38:57.005
So that's why some... Whatever, prostitution 
went on, whatever. All that stuff had to also not

38:58.247 --> 39:07.802
only be morally incorrect, let's say, But the 
Vietnamese probably got to look at us and say, look

39:08.221 --> 39:12.087
at these guys. They're just here to exploit our 
country as much as they can. There's no

39:18.956 --> 39:21.019
high-mindedness here. There's no great cause. 
They're just here. And by that same token, the

39:23.643 --> 39:34.178
Vietnamese, boy, once one of these rice farmers 
has seen the bright lights of Saigon, he ain't

39:23.643 --> 39:34.178
going back. He's got a few bucks in his pocket now 
because he traded in a bunch of beer cans to

39:34.867 --> 39:45.539
somebody so they could make grenades out of them. 
It's just always a way to make a buck in Vietnam. So

39:49.463 --> 39:53.387
the Vietnamese didn't hold a very high opinion of 
Americans. We didn't have any high opinion of

39:53.808 --> 39:55.470
them. We thought they were cowardly. You never 
want to be caught in a firefight with the

39:57.472 --> 40:04.840
Vietnamese as your backup because they were just 
as cowardly as they could be. And we felt that all

40:06.794 --> 40:13.503
they were out there for was to make a buck off the 
GIs. Because they'd sell you anything and

40:14.684 --> 40:20.873
everything. And there was no, we never got the 
feeling that we were there to protect their

40:26.825 --> 40:37.077
democracy because we're looking at people who had 
no concept of democracy or they had no concept of

40:26.825 --> 40:37.077
anything beyond basic survival.

40:41.642 --> 40:44.846
Well, what else is there that you'd like to add? Do 
you think that there's anything I've left out that

40:44.866 --> 40:48.010
may be important? This is my first interview and 
when it comes to war you can't really do

40:55.495 --> 41:24.490
you think that students ought to be taught you know 
a class about Vietnam or do you think this is a good

40:55.495 --> 41:24.490
how do I say it you think it's worth students it's 
unusual that somebody would make a course out of a

41:25.735 --> 41:35.669
out of a conflict, but of course if we learned 
something about it, because you never hear about

41:25.735 --> 41:35.669
Korea.

41:38.353 --> 41:49.308
If our situation were changed to a certain point, 
and I was interviewing my uncle who was a veteran of

41:38.353 --> 41:49.308
Korea,

41:38.353 --> 41:49.308
that never happened. It was such a dull little But 
we won that one, too. Well, nobody won that one. We

41:56.138 --> 42:00.083
just sort of stood two of us up side and said, OK, 
let's just quit. I guess. It wasn't really a

42:00.843 --> 42:06.651
defeat, but then it wasn't any decisive victory, 
because there's still a North Korea.

42:10.315 --> 42:18.726
But that was also another one of those wars that was

42:10.315 --> 42:18.726
a guerrilla warfare. And it was probably just as 
nasty and just as hard fought and unlike the big

42:19.938 --> 42:28.410
World War II. After coming off that resounding 
victory in World War II,

42:29.752 --> 42:40.186
this must have been a real letdown for a lot of the 
guys that were involved in it. Of course, the

42:41.347 --> 42:43.370
frosting on the cake would have been a bit loud. But 
if there's anything to be learned about it,

42:45.273 --> 42:49.759
there's just so much. We just had so many 
presidents that all took a shot at trying to do

42:49.942 --> 42:54.929
something. I found the class very interesting 
because, like I say, when I was young, I saw it on TV.

43:04.703 --> 43:14.937
And it's just something that I never grasped until 
I finally started reading about it and realized

43:04.703 --> 43:14.937
how badly we screwed up. and how it's affected the 
lives of millions of Americans. And I'm sure

43:19.859 --> 43:41.953
whenever veterans or anybody sit around over a 
glass of beer and start a friendly conversation

43:19.859 --> 43:41.953
about it, and you start talking about the 
traditional war story and how you embellish it

43:19.859 --> 43:41.953
over the years, it gets a little bit better and 
better and better and better.

43:47.317 --> 43:56.468
The frustrating part is that once you talk about 
it, it just brings up old, old stuff, and you still

43:47.317 --> 43:56.468
lost the war. Yeah. It doesn't matter. You can just 
sit there and we can complain about Johnson and the

43:58.571 --> 44:08.162
Congress and the corruption and this and that and 
the other thing, but it doesn't change the

43:58.571 --> 44:08.162
outcome. So it seems if there's any futility in 
discussing it or having a course in it, it's just

44:08.182 --> 44:14.590

again. Yeah, that's probably what we'll learn out

44:20.283 --> 44:24.289
of it. Well, I guess that'll do it. I appreciate you 
helping me out. My pleasure. And, gosh, I hope I

44:30.599 --> 44:35.446
don't have to go do anything like that. Learn to 
speak Spanish. Yeah. Thanks a lot. Okay. Bye.
