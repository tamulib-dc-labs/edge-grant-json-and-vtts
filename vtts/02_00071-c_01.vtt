00:02.562 --> 00:07.350
We're continuing the conversation with Mr. 
Evans. Yesterday, in error, I said it was the 11th

00:07.971 --> 00:14.361
of April and it was the 12th. This is Tuesday the 
13th and Mr. Evans is telling, discussing Dean

00:14.501 --> 00:21.433
Kyle. When you were a student, did Dean Kyle have a 
lot of influence on the campus?

00:44.412 --> 01:12.833
Now

00:44.412 --> 01:12.833
the Football games were played on a field named 
Kyle Field. When you were a student, were there

01:19.810 --> 01:25.336
stands for the football stadium? Were there 
already some bleachers built?

01:32.164 --> 01:38.971
And there by the railroad track, how often did the 
trains go through? Was it pretty often or once a day

01:38.991 --> 01:42.195
or what?

01:46.411 --> 01:49.794
And you all rode the train everywhere. When you 
were going to go back home, did you go through

01:51.676 --> 01:56.861
Houston?

02:03.146 --> 02:03.907
San Antonio. San Antonio. But from College 
Station, which direction did you go to get the

02:04.788 --> 02:08.712
train to?

02:13.696 --> 02:14.697
Oh, to Hempstead. And then catch the San Antonio. 
And did your family meet you in San Antonio? I

02:22.960 --> 02:28.769
see.

02:31.955 --> 02:33.898
To Pearsall. And you said your father was growing 
onions at that time?

03:00.593 --> 03:02.377
$8,000. Wow, $8,000 for a crop. And these were, you 
said, yellow Bermudas? Yes. Was that a new variety

03:08.930 --> 03:11.255
of onion then?

03:19.773 --> 03:19.893
Right. It was. It was. It was. It was. It was.

03:31.694 --> 03:33.216
Did you have brothers and sisters?

03:35.920 --> 03:36.501
Two brothers. Two brothers. One sister. One 
sister. Did they go to college? No. You're the

03:40.787 --> 03:41.327
only? Younger brother. Younger brother. Where 
did he go? A&M. To A&M. And did he major in

03:47.115 --> 03:49.819
agriculture also? Dairy husbandry. Dairy 
husbandry, ah. And where did he live after he

03:54.005 --> 03:56.328
graduated? In Brenham. In Brenham. In Brenham. 
Let's see. How often did you have a date when you

04:04.713 --> 04:07.699
were a student?

04:11.886 --> 04:13.349
Didn't have many dates?

04:16.695 --> 04:22.946
When y'all had a dance, was it held in Sabeasa? And 
you had the military ball? Did y'all have the, did

04:27.753 --> 04:31.481
you have a senior dance? What were the names? What 
kinds of dances? Did they have any names? Was the

04:38.215 --> 04:40.159
cotton ball held then? That would be a big one 
later. And the ring dance?

04:57.706 --> 05:01.051
Now, the faculty all lived on the campus. And did 
you have a, did you, were the faculty members all

05:02.993 --> 05:10.224
good to students?

05:15.211 --> 05:15.811
Let's see. And you said you went to class 
regularly. Did you get sick ever while you were at

05:19.877 --> 05:23.702
A&M? Well, if you had, you would have remembered, I 
bet. Let's see. Do you remember when you heard that

05:29.420 --> 05:33.986
the armistice had been signed?

05:37.831 --> 05:38.472
Where were you? Where? You were in the dormitory? 
How did you all learn about it? In the newspaper or

05:46.403 --> 05:48.366
telegraph?

05:51.350 --> 05:52.992
And what did you all do to celebrate?

06:00.886 --> 06:09.462
Because I assume that you all expected that you'd 
be sent over to France if the war had not ended.

06:33.539 --> 06:36.823
Now you were in an infantry outfit, B-1. Did you all 
have a nickname?

06:43.030 --> 06:48.936
You weren't the bad guys or tough guys or big 
bombers or anything like that?

06:58.567 --> 07:01.150
Did many of your friends smoke then?

07:04.319 --> 07:05.060
Did you smoke? And if they did smoke, did they roll 
their own cigarettes? Bull Durham, Prince

07:14.155 --> 07:15.617
Albert? What about snuff or chewing tobacco?

07:23.269 --> 07:27.135
Did some of the students dip snuff?

07:28.057 --> 07:31.542
Did anybody try to keep beer or whiskey in their 
room?

07:34.677 --> 07:41.243
And let's see, that was prohibition, so it wasn't 
legal to drink. Was there a bootlegger anywhere

07:42.224 --> 07:45.427
near the campus?

07:51.213 --> 07:54.336
Did you all have midnight yell practice then 
before the game? And silver taps? And muster?

08:03.185 --> 08:04.566
Where was muster held?

08:09.305 --> 08:17.413
Was

08:09.305 --> 08:17.413
it held on the steps of the YMCA?

08:23.118 --> 08:30.925
Your final review when you were a senior, did your 
parents come for commencement and final review?

08:36.050 --> 08:38.873
But you gave, oh, you weren't in the military as a 
senior? But you told me yesterday you gave the

08:39.460 --> 08:43.625
valedictory address. What did you wear? Did you 
have a special new suit to wear?

08:58.281 --> 09:07.932
When you were getting ready to leave the campus as a 
graduate, did you feel that A&M had prepared you

08:58.281 --> 09:07.932
well? to be out in the business world?

09:18.138 --> 09:19.321
You already had a job. Who helped you get that job?

09:38.405 --> 09:40.228
And that was with the state 4-H. So did the people at 
A&M help graduates to get jobs?

09:57.591 --> 09:58.032
Yes, they did. I don't remember that. Did you feel 
that A&M had prepared you well for that first job?

10:06.003 --> 10:06.083
Yes. What is Aggie spirit?

10:14.018 --> 10:14.919
Spirit you get after you're there four years. 
Spirit you get after you're there four years. Do

10:19.266 --> 10:30.783
you think that that spirit has been consistent 
down through the years?

10:30.803 --> 10:31.524
Very consistent. And what are the things that make 
Aggies proud?

10:55.726 --> 11:23.399
September

10:55.726 --> 11:23.399
16th, was that? Mm-hmm. As long as I'm way back 
there. Stayed with them. Best thing in the world.

11:28.092 --> 11:32.478
What effect has A&M had on your life?

11:42.090 --> 11:42.450
Yes, sir.

11:55.607 --> 11:56.007
Yes, sir.

12:10.077 --> 12:18.625
You've been among the most, if not the most, 
generous person ever, so you must have always been

12:10.077 --> 12:18.625
proud.

12:25.771 --> 12:32.617
Let's see, did Aggie rings in those days, did 
everybody wear an Aggie ring right after they

12:25.771 --> 12:32.617
graduated?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.722
You just happen to have one on today. There you go. 
There you go. And do you remember what it cost? $12?

12:48.196 --> 12:49.639
Because now I think it's about $300. $12. Did you 
have the money or did you need to borrow it?

13:10.777 --> 13:16.793
Did you all have a bonfire then before the Texas 
football game? I did. I did. Do you remember where

13:19.621 --> 13:23.993
it was put?

13:44.763 --> 13:52.793
When

13:44.763 --> 13:52.793
you were a student, were there any Jewish students 
at A&M then? Were there any Mexican students? And

14:00.283 --> 14:07.232
among you and your friends, did it matter that 
somebody was rich or poor? Not a bit in the world. I

14:11.594 --> 14:17.022
always thought the only thing that mattered was 
were they an Aggie or not. Yeah, that's right.

14:18.404 --> 14:18.985
Yeah, that's right.

14:23.332 --> 14:23.712
Let's see. Did you all have to polish Sully, the 
statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross? Did you all

14:31.083 --> 14:32.546
polish it in those?

14:36.351 --> 14:36.792
Let's see. Was Prexy's Moon up there? Mr. Rutter 
used to talk about shooting that light out that was

14:39.760 --> 14:46.368
on top of the academic building. And he said that 
when he was a student, they called it Prexy's Moon.

14:54.297 --> 14:55.599
And that they would shoot at it.

14:59.604 --> 15:00.144
Let's see. I forgot to ask about Jack Williams, 
President Williams. You worked with him. What was

15:08.159 --> 15:10.342
your evaluation of him?

15:13.165 --> 15:26.562
I've always thought that nobody but Earl Rudder 
could have done what he did and nobody but Jack

15:13.165 --> 15:26.562
Williams could have done what he did immediately 
after. That it was the two of them. Do you agree with

15:28.644 --> 15:31.188
that? The two of them did what needed to be done and 
laid the foundation for A&M as it is today.

15:44.089 --> 15:48.877
What do you remember most about Dr. Williams?

15:58.271 --> 15:58.972
Very likable.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.900
I remember a good sense of humor.

16:09.871 --> 16:11.853
I worked very closely with Dr. Williams. And then 
with Mr. Rudder, I was the secretary of the

16:13.796 --> 16:28.854
Aspirations Committee and wrote that report for 
the faculty that recommended women, volunteer

16:13.796 --> 16:28.854
corps, racial integration, and higher admission 
requirements. Damn it. Pretty good. Yes. Let's

16:34.601 --> 16:35.963
see.

16:41.123 --> 16:42.586
Well, then I'm about through. The last question I 
wanted to ask, what feelings do you have in your

16:42.646 --> 16:50.703
heart today about A&M? Very close to A&M. Yes, sir.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.102
I give it all my money. I get pretty good.

17:07.904 --> 17:22.035
If you were the emperor or the king of politics and 
you could do anything for A&M that you wanted to do,

17:07.904 --> 17:22.035
are there any changes you'd make? What would you 
do? You'd move the railroad? Anything else?

17:33.588 --> 17:39.756
And the library, what do you hope the library will 
become?

17:42.760 --> 17:44.142
Well, it's becoming a good one. It certainly is.

17:50.991 --> 17:53.594
And I'm glad it's in the middle of the campus. And 
I'm glad that it is growing. And it's doing that

17:58.801 --> 18:01.705
thanks to people like you. it

18:03.710 --> 18:32.856
certainly is that's about all that I can think of to 
chat with you about let me thank you so much not only

18:03.710 --> 18:32.856
for myself but for everybody that cares about A&M 
for what you have meant to that school and will mean

18:03.710 --> 18:32.856
to A&M forever we are deeply indebted to you and 
deeply grateful to you for your generosity Thank

18:34.591 --> 18:35.304
you.
