00:02.528 --> 00:03.730
April 13.

00:04.692 --> 00:07.316
We're continuing the conversation with Mr. Evans.

00:07.937 --> 00:13.306
Yesterday, in error, I said it was the 11th of April, and it was the 12th.

00:14.467 --> 00:21.399
This is Tuesday the 13th, and Mr. Evans is discussing Dean Kyle.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.068
When you were a student, did Dean Kyle have a lot of influence on the campus?

00:44.395 --> 01:12.782
Now, the

01:13.066 --> 01:18.491
Football games were played on a field named Kyle Field.

01:19.772 --> 01:25.317
When you were a student, were there stands for the football stadium?

01:27.118 --> 01:29.020
Were there already some bleachers built?

01:32.122 --> 01:34.024
Some kind of bleachers.

01:34.044 --> 01:38.908
And there by the railroad track, how often did the trains go through?

01:38.968 --> 01:42.111
Was it pretty often or once a day or what?

01:46.377 --> 01:56.850
and y'all rode the train everywhere, when you were going to go back home, did you go through Houston?

02:03.138 --> 02:03.879
San Antonio.

02:04.139 --> 02:08.685
San Antonio, but from College Station, which direction did you go to get the train to?

02:13.631 --> 02:13.751
Train.

02:13.771 --> 02:13.971
Hempstead.

02:13.991 --> 02:14.612
Oh, to Hempstead.

02:15.554 --> 02:17.297
and then catch the San Antonio.

02:19.281 --> 02:22.647
And did your family meet you in San Antonio?

02:22.927 --> 02:28.738
I see.

02:31.924 --> 02:32.665
To Pearsall.

02:33.887 --> 02:37.073
And you said your father was growing onions at that time?

03:01.842 --> 03:05.249
$8,000 for a crop.

03:05.269 --> 03:07.153
And these were, you said, yellow Bermudas?

03:08.857 --> 03:20.661
Was that a new variety of onion then?

03:31.660 --> 03:33.202
Did you have brothers and sisters?

03:35.885 --> 03:36.486
Two brothers.

03:37.587 --> 03:37.867
Two brothers.

03:37.887 --> 03:38.208
One sister.

03:38.408 --> 03:38.628
One sister.

03:38.648 --> 03:39.529
Did they go to college?

03:40.671 --> 03:40.731
No.

03:40.751 --> 03:42.853
You're the only?

03:42.873 --> 03:43.194
Younger brother.

03:43.214 --> 03:43.834
Younger brother.

03:44.255 --> 03:44.936
Where did he go?

03:44.956 --> 03:46.117
To A&M.

03:46.197 --> 03:46.357
To A&M.

03:47.098 --> 03:49.781
And did he major in agriculture also?

03:51.744 --> 03:52.404
Dairy husband.

03:52.645 --> 03:53.866
Dairy husband.

03:53.886 --> 03:53.946
Ah.

03:53.966 --> 03:56.269
And where did he live after he graduated?

03:58.512 --> 03:58.992
In Brenham.

04:00.213 --> 04:00.634
In Brenham.

04:01.295 --> 04:01.515
In Brenham.

04:03.537 --> 04:03.958
Let's see.

04:04.679 --> 04:07.685
How often did you have a date when you were a student?

04:11.872 --> 04:13.335
Didn't have many dates?

04:16.661 --> 04:22.932
When y'all had a dance, was it held in Cebiza?

04:24.816 --> 04:26.659
And you had the military ball,

04:27.719 --> 04:31.946
Did y'all have the, did you have a senior dance?

04:31.966 --> 04:35.953
What were the names, what kinds of dances, did they have any names?

04:38.177 --> 04:40.140
Was the cotton ball held then?

04:41.062 --> 04:42.504
That would be a big one later.

04:42.965 --> 04:44.327
And the ring dance?

04:57.672 --> 05:01.035
Now, the faculty all lived on the campus.

05:05.339 --> 05:10.203
And were the faculty members all good to students?

05:15.167 --> 05:15.767
Let's see.

05:16.348 --> 05:19.010
And you said you went to class regularly.

05:19.851 --> 05:22.793
Did you get sick ever while you were at A&M?

05:23.674 --> 05:26.937
Well, if you had, you would have remembered, I bet.

05:28.047 --> 05:28.548
Let's see.

05:29.409 --> 05:33.997
Do you remember when you heard that the armistice had been signed?

05:37.824 --> 05:38.465
Where were you?

05:40.208 --> 05:40.408
Where?

05:42.913 --> 05:43.874
You were in the dormitory?

05:44.796 --> 05:46.279
How did you all learn about it?

05:46.379 --> 05:48.322
In the newspaper or telegraph?

05:51.327 --> 05:52.890
And what did you all do to celebrate?

06:00.869 --> 06:09.394
Because I assume that you all expected that you'd be sent over to France if the war had not ended.

06:33.505 --> 06:35.588
Now you were in an infantry outfit.

06:36.249 --> 06:36.809
B1?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.473
Did you all have a nickname?

06:43.018 --> 06:48.886
You weren't the bad guys or tough guys or big bombers or anything like that?

06:58.559 --> 07:01.082
Did many of your friends smoke then?

07:04.302 --> 07:05.043
Did you smoke?

07:07.145 --> 07:12.049
And if they did smoke, did they roll their own cigarettes?

07:14.131 --> 07:17.734
Bull Durham, Prince Albert?

07:17.754 --> 07:19.756
What about snuff or chewing tobacco?

07:23.219 --> 07:27.083
Did some of the students dip snuff?

07:28.024 --> 07:31.407
Did anybody try to keep beer or whiskey in their room?

07:34.660 --> 07:41.228
And let's see, that was prohibition, so it wasn't legal to drink.

07:42.209 --> 07:49.317
Was there a bootlegger anywhere near the campus?

07:51.179 --> 07:54.283
Did you all have midnight yell practice then, before the game?

07:56.426 --> 07:57.387
And silver taps?

07:59.449 --> 08:01.752
And muster?

08:03.153 --> 08:04.515
Where was muster held?

08:09.322 --> 08:13.285
September 16.

08:13.466 --> 08:17.389
Was it held on the steps of the YMCA?

08:23.094 --> 08:30.901
Your final review when you were a senior, did your parents come for commencement and final review?

08:36.026 --> 08:38.788
But you gave, oh, you weren't in the military as a senior?

08:39.443 --> 08:43.587
But you told me yesterday you gave the valedictory address.

08:44.508 --> 08:45.589
What did you wear?

08:45.649 --> 08:49.392
Did you have a special new suit to wear?

08:58.261 --> 09:07.830
When you were getting ready to leave the campus as a graduate, did you feel that A&M had prepared you well

09:08.840 --> 09:10.826
to be out in the business world?

09:18.126 --> 09:19.309
You already had a job.

09:19.329 --> 09:20.773
Who helped you get that job?

09:38.371 --> 09:40.214
And that was with the state 4-H.

09:41.956 --> 09:49.267
So did A&M, did the people at A&M help graduates to get jobs?

09:57.720 --> 10:06.032
Did you feel that A&M had prepared you well for that first job?

10:08.155 --> 10:09.636
What is Aggie spirit?

10:13.981 --> 10:14.882
Spirit you get after you're there four years.

10:14.902 --> 10:16.803
Spirit you get after you're there four years.

10:19.246 --> 10:30.737
Do you think that that spirit has been consistent down through the years?

10:30.757 --> 10:31.498
Very consistent.

10:31.518 --> 10:36.002
And what are the things that make Aggies proud?

10:39.121 --> 10:50.193
I know.

10:57.401 --> 11:02.306
And the media.

11:02.326 --> 11:02.527
Celebrate.

11:02.547 --> 11:02.787
Is that why?

11:02.807 --> 11:03.007
Celebrate.

11:03.027 --> 11:03.288
September 16.

11:03.308 --> 11:03.488
Was that?

11:03.508 --> 11:03.648
Mm-hmm.

11:03.668 --> 11:05.550
As long as I was way back then.

11:12.584 --> 11:32.483
What effect has A&M had on your life?

11:42.073 --> 11:42.473
Yes, sir.

11:55.497 --> 12:23.648
yes sir you've been you've been among the most if not the most generous person ever so you must have always been proud

12:25.687 --> 12:32.574
Let's see, did Aggie rings in those days, did everybody wear an Aggie ring right after they graduated?

12:35.777 --> 12:37.679
You just happened to have one on today.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.782
There you go, there you go.

12:42.144 --> 12:44.366
And do you remember what it cost?

12:46.308 --> 12:46.989
$12?

12:48.170 --> 12:50.412
Because now I think it's about $300, $12.

12:50.873 --> 12:55.137
Did you have the money or did you need to borrow it?

13:10.760 --> 13:16.759
Did y'all have a bonfire then before the Texas football game?

13:19.328 --> 13:19.448
I did.

13:19.468 --> 13:19.589
I did.

13:19.609 --> 13:24.043
Do you remember where it was put?

13:44.729 --> 13:47.914
Let's see.

13:48.535 --> 13:52.803
When you were a student, were there any Jewish students at A&M then?

13:54.966 --> 13:57.931
Were there any Mexican students?

14:00.275 --> 14:07.227
And among you and your friends, did it matter that somebody was rich or poor?

14:09.270 --> 14:10.332
Not a bit in the world.

14:11.577 --> 14:16.984
I always thought the only thing that mattered was were they an Aggie or not.

14:17.465 --> 14:18.346
Yeah, that's right.

14:18.366 --> 14:18.967
Yeah, that's right.

14:23.293 --> 14:23.673
Let's see.

14:24.855 --> 14:27.138
Did you all have to polish Sully?

14:28.299 --> 14:32.505
The statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross, did you all polish it in those?

14:36.310 --> 14:36.691
Let's see.

14:37.031 --> 14:39.154
Was Prexy's moon up there?

14:39.657 --> 14:46.367
Mr. Rutter used to talk about shooting that light out that was on top of the academic building.

14:48.029 --> 14:51.635
And he said that when he was a student, they called it Prexy's Moon.

14:54.279 --> 14:55.561
And that they would shoot at it.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.127
Let's see.

15:02.190 --> 15:05.595
I forgot to ask about Jack Williams, President Williams.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.677
You worked with him.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.328
What was your evaluation of him?

15:12.992 --> 15:13.333
Fine.

15:15.015 --> 15:26.532
I have always thought that nobody but Earl Rudder could have done what he did and nobody but Jack Williams could have done what he did immediately after.

15:27.012 --> 15:31.138
That it was the two of them, do you agree with that?

15:32.721 --> 15:37.187
The two of them did what needed to be done and laid the foundation

15:37.893 --> 15:39.976
for A&M as it is today.

15:44.061 --> 15:48.847
What do you remember most about Dr. Williams?

15:58.240 --> 15:58.921
Very likable.

16:02.345 --> 16:03.867
I remember a good sense of humor.

16:09.837 --> 16:28.825
I worked very closely with Dr. Williams, and then with Mr. Rudder, I was the secretary of the Aspirations Committee and wrote that report for the faculty that recommended women, volunteer corps, racial integration, and higher admission requirements.

16:32.770 --> 16:33.131
Yes.

16:34.573 --> 16:35.895
Let's see.

16:41.107 --> 16:42.569
Well then, I'm about through.

16:42.629 --> 16:50.698
The last question I wanted to ask, what feelings do you have in your heart today about A&M?

16:54.002 --> 16:54.382
Yes, sir.

17:07.998 --> 17:09.780
If you were the

17:10.047 --> 17:22.002
emperor or the king of politics and you could do anything for A&M that you wanted to do, what would you, are there any changes you'd make?

17:22.262 --> 17:22.903
What would you do?

17:22.963 --> 17:25.406
You'd move the railroad?

17:26.648 --> 17:27.329
Anything else?

17:33.616 --> 17:35.078
The only thing you, all right.

17:35.098 --> 17:39.784
And the library, what do you hope the library will become?

17:42.059 --> 17:44.101
Well, it's becoming a good one.

17:44.822 --> 17:45.683
It certainly is.

17:50.948 --> 17:53.551
And I'm glad it's in the middle of the campus.

17:55.573 --> 17:57.715
And I'm glad that it is growing.

17:58.776 --> 18:01.599
And it's doing that thanks to people like you.

18:07.945 --> 18:08.826
It certainly is.

18:09.397 --> 18:14.203
That's about all that I can think of to chat with you about.

18:15.084 --> 18:25.957
Let me thank you so much, not only for myself, but for everybody that cares about A&M, for what you have meant to that school and will mean to A&M forever.

18:27.459 --> 18:32.746
We are deeply indebted to you and deeply grateful to you for your generosity.

18:34.648 --> 18:35.269
Thank you.
