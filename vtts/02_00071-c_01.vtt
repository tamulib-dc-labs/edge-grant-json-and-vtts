00:02.120 --> 00:03.703
April 13. We're continuing the conversation with 
Mr. Evans. Yesterday, in error, I said it was the

00:07.972 --> 00:13.343
11th of April and it was the 12th. This is Tuesday 
the 13th, and Mr. Evans is discussing Dean Kyle.

00:21.280 --> 00:26.944
When you were a student, did Dean Kyle have a lot of 
influence on the campus?

01:12.332 --> 01:18.556
Now, the football games were played on a field 
named Kyle Field. When you were a student, were

01:19.837 --> 01:25.240
there stands for the football stadium? Were there 
already some bleachers built?

01:32.162 --> 01:37.760
And there by the railroad track, how often did the 
trains... How often did the trains go through? Was

01:39.762 --> 01:42.004
it pretty often or once a day or what?

01:46.589 --> 01:49.832
And y'all rode the train everywhere. When you were 
going to go back home, did you go through Houston,

01:51.674 --> 02:08.711
San Antonio, but from College Station, which 
direction did you go to get the train to?

02:13.697 --> 02:17.160
Oh, to Hempstead, and then catch the San Antonio. 
And did your family meet you in San Antonio? San

02:21.730 --> 02:28.472
Antonio, or did

02:21.730 --> 02:28.472
you... I see.

02:31.934 --> 02:32.634
To Pearsall. And you said your father was growing 
onions at that time?

03:02.205 --> 03:05.286
$8,000 for a crop. And these were, you said, yellow 
Bermudas? Was that a new variety of onion then?

03:31.755 --> 03:33.236
Did you have brothers and sisters?

03:35.937 --> 03:36.517
Two brothers? One sister? Did they go to college? 
You're the only younger brother. Where did he go?

03:45.600 --> 03:46.361
To A&M. And did he major in agriculture also? Dairy 
husband. Ah. And where did he live after he

03:53.967 --> 03:56.309
graduated? In Brenham. In Brenham.

04:03.615 --> 04:03.955
Let's see. How often did you have a date when you 
were a student?

04:11.901 --> 04:13.362
Didn't have any many dates?

04:16.685 --> 04:22.790
When y'all had a dance, was it held in Sabisa? You 
bet. Did y'all have the military ball? Did y'all

04:27.793 --> 04:31.476
have the, did you have a senior dance? What were the 
names, what kinds of dances, did they have any

04:31.996 --> 04:35.978
names? Was the cotton ball held then? That would be 
a big one later. And the ring dance?

04:57.772 --> 05:01.074
Now, the faculty all lived on the campus? And did 
you have, did you, were the faculty members all

05:02.996 --> 05:09.860
good to students? Let's

05:09.860 --> 05:15.806
see. And you said you went to class regularly. Did 
you get sick ever while you were at A&M? Well, if you

05:23.695 --> 05:25.877
had, you would have remembered, I bet. Let's see. 
Do you remember when you heard that the armistice

05:29.441 --> 05:34.025
had been signed?

05:37.850 --> 05:38.490
Where were you? Where? You were in the dormitory? 
How did y'all learn about it? In the newspaper or

05:46.419 --> 05:47.800
telegraph? And what did y'all do to celebrate?

06:00.968 --> 06:09.434
Because I assume that y'all expected that you'd be 
sent over to France if the war had not ended.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.611
Now, you were in an infantry outfit. B-1? Did y'all 
have a nickname?

06:43.056 --> 06:48.920
You weren't the bad guys or tough guys or big 
bombers or anything like that? Did

06:51.110 --> 07:00.890
many of your friends smoke then?

07:04.240 --> 07:05.081
Did you smoke? And if they did smoke, did they roll 
their own cigarettes? Bull Durham? Prince

07:14.948 --> 07:15.470
Albert? What about snuff or chewing tobacco?

07:23.272 --> 07:24.800
Did some of the students dip snuff?

07:27.540 --> 07:31.280
Did anybody try to keep beer or whiskey in their 
room? And

07:31.840 --> 07:36.114
let's see. That was prohibition, so it wasn't 
legal to drink. Was there a bootlegger? Anywhere

07:43.310 --> 07:45.410
near the campus?

07:49.650 --> 07:54.330
Did y'all have midnight yell practice then before 
the game? And silver taps?

08:00.130 --> 08:01.741
And muster? Where was muster held?

08:12.900 --> 08:17.180
Was it held on the steps of the YMCA?

08:22.840 --> 08:25.620
Your final review when you were a senior? Did your 
parents come for commencement and final review?

08:31.220 --> 08:49.410
But

08:31.220 --> 08:49.410
you gave, oh, you weren't in the military as a 
senior, but you gave the, you told me yesterday,

08:31.220 --> 08:49.410
you gave the valedictory address, what did you 
wear, did you have a special new suit to wear?

08:57.820 --> 09:10.860
When you were getting ready to leave the campus as a 
graduate, did you feel that you, that A&M had

08:57.820 --> 09:10.860
prepared you well to be out in the business world?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.320
You already had, who helped you get that job? And

09:21.000 --> 09:40.210
that was with the state 4-H? So, did A&M, did the 
people at A&M help graduates to get jobs?

09:57.420 --> 10:01.520
Did you feel that A&M had prepared you well for that 
first job?

10:08.110 --> 10:09.651
What is Aggie spirit?

10:14.690 --> 10:16.810
Spirit you get after you're there four years. Do 
you think that that spirit has been consistent

10:18.530 --> 10:25.190
down through the years? Yes.

10:31.026 --> 10:35.880
And what, what are the things that make Aggies 
proud? What

10:36.300 --> 11:32.540
effect has A&M had on your life?

11:41.670 --> 11:42.431
Yes, sir.

11:55.460 --> 11:55.922
Yes, sir.

12:10.020 --> 12:14.880
You've been, you've been among the most, if not the 
most generous person ever. So, you must have

12:15.680 --> 12:18.540
always been proud.

12:25.660 --> 12:31.980
Let's see, did Aggie rings in those days, did 
everybody wear an Aggie ring right after they

12:25.660 --> 12:31.980
graduated? Yes.

12:35.807 --> 12:37.720
You just happened to have one on today. There you 
go, there you go. And do you remember what it cost,

12:41.760 --> 12:47.090
$12? Because now I think it's about $300, $12. Did 
you have the money or did you need to borrow it?

13:11.240 --> 13:16.800
Did you all have a, a bonfire then before the Texas 
football game? Do you remember where it was,

13:19.480 --> 13:20.741
where, where it was brought? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. 
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

13:47.520 --> 13:52.760
Let's see, when you were a student, were there any 
Jewish students at A&M then? Were there any

13:54.490 --> 13:57.830
Mexican students?

14:00.800 --> 14:07.200
And among you and your friends, did it matter that 
somebody was rich or poor? Not a bit in the world. I

14:11.490 --> 14:17.030
always thought the only thing that mattered was 
were they an Aggie or not. Yes, that's right. Yes,

14:18.230 --> 14:18.991
that's right. That's right.

14:23.321 --> 14:31.039
let's see, did y'all have to polish Sully, the 
statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross? Did y'all

14:31.400 --> 14:32.504
polish it in those?

14:36.319 --> 14:39.090
Let's see, was Prexy's Moon up there? Mr. Rudder 
used to talk about shooting that light out that was

14:41.740 --> 14:46.403
on top of the academic building. And he said that 
when he was a student, they called it Prexy's Moon

14:49.880 --> 14:55.572
and that they would shoot at it.

14:59.581 --> 15:03.710
Let's see, I forgot to ask about Jack Williams, 
President Williams. You worked with him. What was

15:08.209 --> 15:10.378
your evaluation of him? Fine. I've always thought 
that nobody but Earl Rudder could have done what he

15:14.570 --> 15:23.000
did and nobody but Jack Williams could have done 
what he did immediately after. That it was the two

15:26.480 --> 15:28.610
of them. Do you agree with that? The two of them did 
what needed to be done and laid the foundation for

15:35.420 --> 15:40.034
A&M as it is today.

15:44.106 --> 15:48.740
What do you remember most about Dr. Williams?

15:57.810 --> 15:58.913
Very likable.

16:02.343 --> 16:03.747
I remember a good sense of humor.

16:09.985 --> 16:11.810
I worked very closely with Dr. Williams. And then 
with Mr. Rudder, I was the secretary... I was the

16:15.390 --> 16:21.190
secretary of the Aspirations Committee and wrote 
that report for the faculty that recommended

16:21.170 --> 16:28.850
women, volunteer corps, racial integration, and 
higher admission requirements.

16:32.730 --> 16:33.111
Yes. Let's see.

16:41.124 --> 16:42.627
Well then, I'm about through. The last question I 
wanted to ask, what feelings do you have in your

16:42.667 --> 16:50.680
heart today about A&M? Very good. Yes, sir. If

16:54.640 --> 17:22.029
you were the emperor or the king of tech, of 
politics, and you could do anything for A&M that

16:54.640 --> 17:22.029
you wanted to do, what would you, are there any 
changes you'd make? What would you do? You'd move

17:23.250 --> 17:27.377
the railroad, anything else?

17:33.729 --> 17:34.109
All right. And the library, what, what do you hope 
the library will become? Well, it's becoming...

17:42.980 --> 17:53.030
becoming a good one it certainly is it

17:42.980 --> 17:53.030
and I'm glad it's in the middle of the campus and I'm 
glad that it is growing and it's doing that thanks

17:53.010 --> 18:00.990
to people like you it

18:00.970 --> 18:13.710
certainly is that's about all that I can think of to 
chat with you about let me thank you so much not only

18:13.690 --> 18:20.170
for myself but for everybody that cares about A&M 
for what you have meant to that school and will mean

18:20.150 --> 18:25.330
to A&M forever we are deeply and indebted to you and 
deeply grateful to you for your generosity thank

18:31.910 --> 18:37.040
you
