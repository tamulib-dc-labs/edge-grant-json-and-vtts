00:04.250 --> 00:07.253
An interview with Brigadier General Mike 
Kokonos. Today is Monday, 1st of June. This is

00:09.655 --> 00:10.636
Terry Anderson. Let's start by asking where and 
when you were born. I was born in Beaumont, Texas,

00:14.520 --> 00:17.804
February the 2nd, 1920.

00:21.888 --> 00:24.771
General Kokonos prefers Mike P. Kokonos. Why do 
you prefer P? Because it's my daddy's name, Pete.

00:28.975 --> 00:29.335
Okay, Pete. Tell me about your father. I like to be 
identified with my daddy. Okay, tell me about your

00:32.178 --> 00:33.459
father. Papa... Papa came to Beaumont, Texas 
around 1909 from Greece. And he's... Whereabouts

00:41.857 --> 00:42.758
in Greece? He's from Parga, Greece. P-A-R-G-A. 
It's the northwest part of Greece. Macedonia? No,

00:52.310 --> 00:54.753
no, Peloponnesus. Yeah, Peloponnesus, or Carfu, 
near Carfu, the island of Carfu. And he came to

00:59.479 --> 01:04.125
Beaumont and opened up a restaurant And then he 
stayed here a year or two, and then he went back to

01:05.067 --> 01:12.841
Greece and married Mama and brought Mama back to 
Beaumont. And this is where we have stayed and

01:12.941 --> 01:18.791
lived ever since they came to Texas. Now, when he 
came, why Texas? He had a friend from his hometown

01:22.538 --> 01:28.688
who worked at LaBelle, Texas. He worked on a ranch. 
And he told Papa to come on and work with us. And when

01:33.249 --> 01:37.156
Papa got here, he didn't like working out there as a 
cowboy. So he came into Beaumont. La Belle is about

01:39.540 --> 01:43.346
five miles outside of Beaumont. Did he keep the 
restaurant for his entire life? No. Can you tell me

01:47.393 --> 01:47.994
about that? Yes, he kept the restaurant for 
several years. And then the children began to

01:51.981 --> 01:55.847
come, my older brother, GP Coconuts and Jimmy and 
myself and he then opened up a grocery store a

01:56.097 --> 02:16.266
confectionary type by the old baseball park on 
Magnolia Street and we lived behind the grocery

01:56.097 --> 02:16.266
store or confectionary and we lived behind it and 
And he had the restaurant and the confectionery.

02:18.293 --> 02:24.381
And then the Depression hit about 26, well, 29, 
somewhere along in there. And he lost the

02:24.401 --> 02:26.484
restaurant and kept the grocery store. And we were 
all raised behind this grocery store, my three

02:26.504 --> 02:35.936
brothers and sister, Helen and Andrew and Jimmy 
and GP, Janess. And then he had that for a while. And

02:41.623 --> 02:44.867
when he lost it, he got into the bread business. He 
was a bread salesman. Oh, really? For a company, or

02:47.740 --> 02:49.282
did he have his own? No, for Purity Bakery. It was a 
company here in Beaumont, and he sold bread and

02:50.825 --> 03:01.259
rolls, hot dog rolls and hamburger rolls to the 
rest of us, and we used to go as kids to help him do

02:50.825 --> 03:01.259
that. We'd get up in the morning around 2, 33 
o'clock in the morning and help Papa pack the rolls

03:01.920 --> 03:10.772
in the truck from the hot ovens. This is during the 
Depression? During the Depression, 29, 30, 31,

03:12.093 --> 03:15.598
and And we would make the rounds with him to all the 
restaurants and grocery stores that he had and

03:16.186 --> 03:25.759
help him deliver the rolls and deliver the bread, 
French bread. And he kept that for a while and then

03:26.740 --> 03:34.511
we finally, we had to give up the grocery store. It 
just got too bad. We couldn't handle it anymore and

03:35.873 --> 03:41.240
then we moved into another, right around- In other 
words, you weren't making enough money to make it

03:35.873 --> 03:41.240
work? Money to make the grocery store work. And so 
we, We moved right, just right around the corner,

03:45.582 --> 03:51.849
half a block away on Hazel Street, 947 Hazel 
Street. And to this day, we all still own that

03:52.570 --> 03:55.133
property. And my brother, Janice, has his oil 
office there. He's an independent oil operator.

04:00.839 --> 04:03.543
Remodeled it and fixed it up. Now, I'm wondering 
about your father's education. Papa, Papa

04:06.586 --> 04:14.475
finished

04:06.586 --> 04:14.475
high school in one year of college in Greece. And 
then that's the reason we're all graduates of A&M,

04:17.714 --> 04:27.329
because he insisted that we go to college. It was 
his driving force that led us to A&M. And A&M, he

04:33.578 --> 04:39.607
really picked A&M because it was a military 
school. It was conservative type. school, which

04:43.092 --> 04:45.695
is his thinking. He was a conservative type 
person, and he... Conservative in what way?

04:52.965 --> 04:58.973
Conservative in not, well, in his love for this 
country. He thought America was the greatest

05:00.736 --> 05:05.882
country in the world, do anything for it, and he 
felt that we would... He never had a longing then to

05:05.983 --> 05:07.985
go back to Greece? Never. He loved it. Except to 
marry. Just to marry and get mom and bring her back

05:10.549 --> 05:12.832
here. Mm-hmm. And after he brought her back here, 
brought her back to Beaumont, he then went about

05:13.400 --> 05:25.633
raising a family. And we were instilled

05:26.494 --> 05:37.646
by him, the discipline of running a... Oh, you 
don't want to stay around here? No, baby, it's on

05:37.666 --> 05:38.707
TV. It's on tape. Oh, that's okay. We'll just erase 
anything. I wasn't even there. He was

05:43.403 --> 06:04.016
a

05:43.403 --> 06:04.016
person who kept a low profile, but yet he was 
strong-willed and he maintained discipline in

05:43.403 --> 06:04.016
the family. So in other words, you're defining him 
as a conservative, as a man who loves his his

06:11.197 --> 06:14.381
country was strong-willed and it was a 
disciplinarian. Disciplinarian, right. And

06:16.503 --> 06:25.875
he loved the old country ideas and he thought A&M 
was that way. I see, yeah. See, and because he, we

06:28.178 --> 06:36.748
were, I know, I remember as a little kid that people 
come talk to Papa about, well, Why don't you send

06:37.353 --> 06:39.075
him to some other schools? Send my older brother. 
See, he was in, he was the one that first went to A&M.

06:44.240 --> 06:54.050
And he had gone to, my brother Pete, Janelle, had 
gone to some, he'd gone to, let's see, a couple

06:44.240 --> 06:54.050
other schools just to visit. And he hitched tight. 
And he'd come back home and he would tell Papa what

06:56.252 --> 07:00.496
they looked like and what the schools were all 
about. And Papa said, well, A&M sounds like the

07:00.516 --> 07:04.660
school I'd like to see my sons go to. And so... It's 
military. It means it would help you become a good

07:07.897 --> 07:18.106
citizen by being, participating in the military, 
and just been there. And so that's how we were led to

07:18.906 --> 07:24.431
go to A&M. Now, was he, was your father ever 
involved in the military, either in Greece or in

07:24.671 --> 07:31.417
America? Yeah, he was involved in Greece when the 
Turkish See, the Turkish rule in Greece, he was

07:38.035 --> 07:43.260
involved a little while then he left. So he had a 
favorable idea of the military before he came to

07:45.061 --> 07:49.765
this country. Right, yeah. So he felt that the 
military helped him. That's correct. He felt the

07:57.632 --> 08:00.555
military helped him to help us. So it was really 
passed on down to us from him by his training that he

08:01.535 --> 08:07.941
had in the military in Greece. But he never talked 
much about it though. When was that? I don't know.

08:14.100 --> 08:23.911
He just, of course we were kids growing up and he was 
too busy trying to make a living I guess and we never

08:14.100 --> 08:23.911
really talked much about it except military. He 
liked the military. How about the old country? Did

08:26.634 --> 08:29.036
he talk much about what life was? Did you ever ask 
your father about what it was like back in the old

08:29.157 --> 08:32.981
country? He did. Of course we were kids. Papa died 
awfully young. Yeah. He died... He was 58, and we

08:39.224 --> 08:46.135
were gone in the army when he died in 45. He talked 
about life in the old country, but as kids, you

08:48.398 --> 09:05.485
know, it's hard to remember things that he would 
tell, but I remember one time he said, well, he

08:48.398 --> 09:05.485
says, it's a good thing we live in America, 
otherwise you might have been a goat herder, a goat

08:48.398 --> 09:05.485
tenderer. He says, you'd have been a good one, 
because I'd have made you a good one, you know. But

09:10.442 --> 09:13.206
that was another thing he liked about America 
then, the mobility. Mobility and the

09:13.226 --> 09:15.909
opportunities that we had here. Yeah. Yeah. Just 
great opportunities.

09:21.817 --> 09:27.624
But he liked the simple things of Greece, you know, 
the simple things in life. He never dressed

09:28.265 --> 09:31.589
extravagantly. Of course, he couldn't. Things 
were tough. Yeah, yeah. And Mama was very prudent

09:35.013 --> 09:39.539
in her running the house. I can remember when he was 
selling bread on the bread truck that he gave her 50

09:41.040 --> 09:48.509
cents. He said, now this is for today's meals. And 
Mama would walk blocks to the A&P store and the

09:54.096 --> 09:59.142
grocery store. We had a neighborhood grocery 
store, but she'd walk blocks to go to the grocery

09:59.162 --> 10:03.788
store to save a few pennies. to buy, you know, beans 
or rice or whatever. So she could make that 50 cents

10:08.251 --> 10:11.053
last the whole day. And she could. Oh, yeah. And 
so... Could you tell me about her more, your

10:14.256 --> 10:19.001
mother? Could you describe what type of person she 
was? She was a small person, but she was...

10:21.303 --> 10:29.010
She loved to help people. I never said anything 
like it. She would walk blocks, miles. Somebody

10:32.213 --> 10:32.914
was sick. Yeah, especially her Greek friends that 
she knew. She would walk to help them out and spend

10:39.328 --> 10:43.134
the day with them. Even though we were at home, the 
kids were at home, she was willing to go out and help

10:44.075 --> 10:52.328
whatever need they needed. And

10:52.348 --> 10:56.995
people liked her. She spoke. She understood 
English well, but she still spoke with a Greek

11:03.100 --> 11:08.045
accent.

11:08.365 --> 11:11.568
In our home, we had to talk Greek. Really? That's 
how we learned to speak Greek. We'd talk Greek. In

11:15.932 --> 11:29.766
fact, I can remember Mama saying to us in Greek, 
you're going to go to school and learn the English

11:15.932 --> 11:29.766
language, but we don't have any Greek school here, 
so I'm going to teach you Greek at home. We're going

11:29.786 --> 11:30.647
to all talk Greek. So we'd talk and get home. And, of 
course, we would talk English to Mama, so she would

11:33.155 --> 11:38.682
learn how to speak English. Of course, Papa spoke 
well. He was very fluent in his English language

11:41.205 --> 11:45.850
and wrote well.

11:47.753 --> 11:55.041
But she would make us talk Greek, so we would learn 
it. And thank God we did, because that's the way we

11:55.121 --> 11:57.184
learned. We learned how all of us speak Greek. Who 
is the authority in the household? The father.

12:03.209 --> 12:04.570
Papa was. He ran the house. There was no question 
about it. No question about it. He was the boss. And

12:10.055 --> 12:12.517
then, of course, he wasn't around. Then the older 
brother was the authority. My brother Janelle. We

12:18.342 --> 12:19.183
call him Janelle. It's GP. He finished A&M in 38, 
petroleum engineering. And then after Papa died

12:24.747 --> 12:32.794
in 45, the older brother steps in and takes over. 
But he, but Papa was the boss. Oh yeah. So it was a

12:36.839 --> 12:41.128
traditional family structure then. Right. 
Almost molded on the old country, but modified. By

12:45.236 --> 12:47.180
the American way of life. Oh yeah, it was very 
traditional. And we still try to maintain that

12:49.926 --> 12:53.854
today. Speaking Greek, that's rather 
interesting because when my

12:54.070 --> 13:12.551
great-great-grandfather came over from 
Germany, one of the very first things on my

12:54.070 --> 13:12.551
mother's side, one of the very first things that my 
great-great-grandmother did was forbid the

12:54.070 --> 13:12.551
children to speak German because she wanted them 
to become Americans. Americans speak American or

13:12.932 --> 13:15.935
English. And so this is rather interesting that 
you spoke Greek at home. Yeah, we did. We spoke

13:21.361 --> 13:23.824
Greek at home with Mama And, of course, Papa too 
didn't want us to lose that heritage that we had and

13:24.192 --> 13:30.999
traditions. But yet, at the same time, Papa 
preached to us that he wanted us to be an American

13:32.120 --> 13:46.455
citizen and be a patriotic American citizen. 
America comes first. No second thoughts about

13:48.498 --> 13:52.742
Greece or anything like that. America was first. 
And this was his, he used to, of course, later on, he

13:54.365 --> 14:11.230
bought a dinner club out on the highway, and he 
would always greet the customers with, God bless

13:54.365 --> 14:11.230
America. Really? Yeah, and a little grease. 
That's during the war, during the war in 1941 to

14:14.235 --> 14:19.663
1945.

14:20.892 --> 14:29.543
The Navy had a base in Orange, Texas, and so we had a 
lot of Navy personnel, and they traded with him and

14:20.892 --> 14:29.543
patronized his little dinner pub he had out there. 
And people from Fort Polk used to come over. Did he

14:32.806 --> 14:36.751
ever go back to Greece on a vacation? Never did. 
Neither did Mama. Have you? I have not. Now, my

14:41.898 --> 14:50.528
brother has, and I was on the plane in Rome, Italy, 
after the war when I was on occupation duty as a

14:50.795 --> 14:55.522
lieutenant. And I was waiting on a plane in Rome to 
fly to Athens to go to Parga in Paxos, where my

14:56.143 --> 15:03.493
mother was from. And I had my pass from the army and 
everything. They authorized it because I was a

15:06.978 --> 15:09.822
blood kin. They had a communist uprising. And we 
were grounded and we couldn't get over there. So it

15:15.430 --> 15:17.053
knocked me out. And the only way you could get into 
Greece, because you know, Germany, just

15:20.579 --> 15:21.841
dominated. I mean, it just slaughtered all these 
people. It was incredible what they did to

15:25.266 --> 15:27.089
Germany. And of course, the Greeks put up a very 
strong fight with them. And America, the United

15:31.195 --> 15:38.306
States Army's position was they didn't want any 
tourists going over there. Of course, they were

15:38.327 --> 15:39.869
communists. Well, it was devastating. It was 
devastating. Plus the Civil War. Civil War. See,

15:43.414 --> 15:44.576
they were the communists. But when they found out, 
if they found out you had blood kin, then you can get

15:49.570 --> 15:52.073
a special pass. So I was on the plane at Rome. I was 
sitting on the plane ready to go. And I had not been,

15:57.020 --> 16:02.687
but my brother's family has been over there. My 
sister's been there. But that's interesting that

16:07.313 --> 16:09.195
you haven't been. We talk about going. But you've 
got seven kids, Terry. Educating them, you know,

16:14.923 --> 16:18.227
it's pretty hard. And so we were, we'd still think 
about going, and we are, we're going to go. My son's

16:24.907 --> 16:31.476
been, my son pays class of 80 at A&M. Went to Papa's 
church on Easter Sunday this past year. He was over

16:38.867 --> 16:45.436
there, he took a, when he got out of A&M, he took the 
tour, backpacked it. And when he stayed, he stayed

16:45.456 --> 16:47.539
in, in Greece about six weeks. And he celebrated 
Easter with my Papa's church and family over

16:50.701 --> 16:57.468
there. Well, that brings me to another topic. 
You've been the past president of the St. George

16:59.911 --> 17:04.956
Greek Orthodox Church here. And I was wondering 
how or what role that religion played in your

17:05.477 --> 17:10.362
upbringing. Well, it played a very strong

17:18.232 --> 17:26.720
part in my life because we attended the Orthodox 
Church ever since we kept baptizing the church.

17:26.820 --> 17:39.872
And it helped me in my military duties because I 
always regarded the chaplain as a key staff

17:26.820 --> 17:39.872
advisor. And I always sought his advice and sought 
his guidance and commanding. And be surprised.

17:50.768 --> 18:03.106
The chaplains that I talked to were, you know, 
couldn't comprehend sometimes why my emphasis

17:50.768 --> 18:03.106
was always with them, because the previous 
commanders they had just kind of pushed them

17:50.768 --> 18:03.106
aside. Yeah, pushed them aside. Now, I didn't make 
a big, big splash about it. It was always sort of

18:09.635 --> 18:14.682
just like my religions, very conservative and 
very traditional. and very orthodox. That's what

18:16.313 --> 18:18.035
we are, Greek orthodox. And so I had the situation 
to earn me the same way. It was always a very

18:24.384 --> 18:32.115
low-profile approach with the chaplain, but I 
emphasized his use. And I was always,

18:32.175 --> 18:42.610
really, the chaplains always were kind of 
surprised that I would seek them. But I did it not

18:43.691 --> 18:45.073
for myself. for the unit or for the personnel. And I 
was president five, six years of the church here.

18:53.847 --> 18:57.773
And we have one church in the area, and it's in Port 
Offaly, Texas. It's about 22 miles from here. And I

19:00.717 --> 19:08.368
used to load my seven kids, and Catherine and I, and 
station away, and off we'd go every Sunday. So it

19:09.430 --> 19:11.513
played, and then Papa. Very important. Papa was 
what we call a, A lay reader in church. Only we do it

19:17.793 --> 19:19.055
by chanting. We sing. I don't know if you've ever 
been to Greek Orthodoxy. It's all singing. The

19:24.323 --> 19:26.607
priests, the choir, and the chanters. They chant 
the prayers. Oh, really? Yes, it's singing. Papa

19:34.118 --> 19:35.120
was a Greek. He did it in Greek while the choir would 
do it in English. That's when I was a kid growing up.

19:43.964 --> 19:47.868
And so that always left a strong impression on me. 
So my whole family, my brothers, sisters, we all

19:48.449 --> 19:56.017
feel the same way about religion, very strong. And 
it has played a very strong part in my life. OK, I was

20:02.764 --> 20:08.951
wondering something else about your Greek 
heritage and the fact that you were an immigrant

20:02.764 --> 20:08.951
son. Did you ever feel that you were being 
discriminated against in this country? I never

20:17.492 --> 20:18.313
felt it. Even though as kids, we were the only 
Greeks in the block. Yeah, I would imagine. This

20:29.864 --> 20:31.585
area doesn't have a large population. No, it 
really doesn't. No, I didn't think so. But I never

20:34.848 --> 20:38.351
felt discriminated, except when I got older. Tell 
me about it. I run across people who, I'm talking

20:43.887 --> 21:05.374
about maturity, 30, 35, 40 years old, and in the 
Army, who would, I got the feeling that people I was

20:43.887 --> 21:05.374
talking to, my superior officers, would kind of 
say, Greek, you know. But as a young kid growing up,

21:06.175 --> 21:09.599
I never got that feeling. But I guess it's because 
as you get older, it's very competitive, and it

21:09.619 --> 21:13.624
gets, you know, people look for weaknesses in you. 
See, and they try to probe your weakness. And they

21:20.946 --> 21:27.215
thought maybe because I was of Greek heritage that 
that might be a weakness. Actually, there was a

21:28.036 --> 21:30.860
stronger point in my life. I was strong. Because it 
was an inheritance that I had and it was mine. And I

21:38.170 --> 21:39.992
just felt proud. But yet at the same time, I was a you 
know, American citizen, born and raised here. Did

21:46.225 --> 21:47.747
your father ever complain? Never. Papa never 
complained. You never said anything about that?

21:51.772 --> 21:55.317
No, I never heard Papa complain about it at all. At 
all. And neither did Mama. Of course, Mama wasn't

21:59.082 --> 22:02.266
in the civic world like Papa was. Never 
complained. But that's interesting that you

22:05.190 --> 22:11.438
realize this in the military because the military 
in this country has been... Well, it's been a part

22:12.363 --> 22:42.184
of society, which has taken all types, all races, 
colors, and creeds, and put them into one big pot,

22:12.363 --> 22:42.184
sort of the melting pot idea, and really outlawed 
discrimination or racism, like what Truman did

22:12.363 --> 22:42.184
for the blacks in the military, by integrating it, 
and really... Well, the ethnic composure of a

22:12.363 --> 22:42.184
person, it's just, you... in life, you run across a 
few people who resent the fact that, you know,

22:43.463 --> 22:53.315
they're not the same ethnic race as you. And I, like 
I said, I didn't feel this until I was older. A&M

22:59.583 --> 23:01.765
loved us. Man, it was just, you know, talk about a 
melting pot. A&M was a melting pot, you know. And

23:07.913 --> 23:10.416
there was no discrimination there at all, never. 
In fact, they never called me Greek in the A&M. It

23:14.419 --> 23:17.403
was always Coke or Cokie or Mike. In the Army, later 
on, I was referred to as, oh, yeah, that Greek major

23:18.064 --> 23:29.058
down there. See, that's what I was telling you 
about. Sure. Because, or that Greek colonel.

23:36.107 --> 23:38.890
Because we're battalion commanders in the same 
division. You know, you compete. units against

23:40.400 --> 23:43.823
unit, and commanders against commander. It's a 
competition. And Kidwell will tell you this. See,

23:48.568 --> 23:50.370
I served with Kidwell for 70 years. He was my 
artillery commander. But this is where, this is an

23:52.552 --> 23:56.596
example I'm going to use. Okay. Let's talk for a 
minute about your siblings, your brothers and

23:57.277 --> 24:01.461
your sisters and your family. How did you get along 
with them? Great. Yes, great. No question about

24:04.564 --> 24:05.465
it. My older brother was the leader, and he was the 
boss among the brothers. But we got along fine. We

24:11.529 --> 24:13.111
all lived together. Lived in one room. And we, for a 
while, we all lived in one bed. Slept in one bed. The

24:19.859 --> 24:22.483
brothers and sister had one little room. We were a 
very modest means of living. A house behind a big

24:27.188 --> 24:28.430
street. I can imagine the depression. Yeah, it was 
tough. And we lived in bed. And then one day, Popper

24:32.955 --> 24:35.618
bought another bed. And so we split up. My older 
brother and I slept together, and Jimmy, who was

24:37.876 --> 24:43.202
next to the oldest, and Andrew, my younger 
brother, slept together. And then when we moved

24:44.124 --> 24:51.653
around the corner to the big house that had one, 
two, three bedrooms, we thought we were having

24:44.124 --> 24:51.653
this ride. And so we all grew up playing with each 
other and defending each other at the Y. YMCA was a

24:52.614 --> 25:01.445
very important part of my life. My brother's wife. 
Why don't we explain that, Tom? Well, I lived about

25:04.528 --> 25:06.651
two blocks from the Y. And we used to go down to the Y 
as kids, 10, 11 years old. And that's where we

25:13.762 --> 25:17.606
learned to swim and play football and basketball. 
In fact, that's where I learned to play

25:17.686 --> 25:20.028
basketball. They got me my basketball 
scholarship at A&M. Really? Yeah. It's at the Y.

25:26.173 --> 25:36.402
And when we had little problems among the kids, you 
know, we want to fight, it was always the four

25:26.173 --> 25:36.402
coconuts against whoever wanted to fight us. And 
we sold newspapers on the street together. We

25:42.241 --> 25:59.699
would, downtown Beaumont, we'd get up in the 
mornings around 4.30, and we'd go down and grab

25:42.241 --> 25:59.699
about 10 newspapers, Beaumont Enterprise, and 
we'd go down the corner, like the Edson Hotel

25:42.241 --> 25:59.699
corner, and try to, because there was more traffic 
there, and we'd try to sell the papers. And the

26:01.040 --> 26:03.823
other newspaper boys would try to come chase us 
all. Well, I just followed them. That's right. I

26:08.489 --> 26:10.212
had to chase all the brothers off. We'd fight them. 
Then my brother, Janelle, would go to the Fuller

26:12.174 --> 26:19.363
Cafe corner. That was another one. And the bigger 
boys would want to jump in. Well, boy, we'd all run

26:22.287 --> 26:27.934
down there, and first thing you know, we were 
fighting these newspaper boys. So we all grew up

26:28.655 --> 26:32.460
together as one. Real close. Real close. Very 
close knit. And even today, we go to dances

26:36.021 --> 26:45.381
together, we go to parties together, we go to 
socials together, and funerals together. A

26:45.862 --> 26:49.750
friend of ours, we all go together wherever we go. 
Honor the governor of Texas, we all go together.

26:53.281 --> 26:54.342
How about rivalry? Did you have much rivalry, or 
was it more of a learning, or was it more of a

26:54.362 --> 26:59.008
situation? Not like I had a lot of rivalry with my 
brother. It's normal. Yeah, I guess, yeah, it was a

27:03.072 --> 27:07.137
little rivalry. More so, I guess, because Andrew, 
my younger brother, and I were close. Because we

27:13.344 --> 27:20.352
were in junior high and high school together, and 
we participated in a basketball team. And so there

27:22.053 --> 27:24.455
was a little rivalry there. Swimming team down at 
the Y. Andrew

27:24.495 --> 27:34.304
and I. But there wasn't much rivalry between my 
older brother, because they were a little older

27:35.105 --> 27:40.009
than we were, and Jimmy. Jimmy and I boxed 
together. He was in high school. By the way, he was a

27:47.296 --> 27:49.478
Golden Cup champ. Years ago, my brother Jim and his 
former marital... He used you for his punching

27:52.761 --> 27:53.983
bag? He used me for his punching bag. I was in junior 
high and he was in high school, and I used to go with

27:55.785 --> 28:08.861
the Beaumont High School boxing team to different 
cities, Louisiana, Houston, Galveston, and they

27:55.785 --> 28:08.861
didn't have anybody small enough to fight him, so 
they used me. So we would fight. We were always

28:11.464 --> 28:15.409
close, and we'd see who could beat each other. 
That's about it. But as far as rivalry, it was just a

28:16.947 --> 28:24.419
very friendly rival type thing. Now, you've had, 
there's no doubt about it, you've had a very

28:24.439 --> 28:28.565
successful career. In what way do you think your 
parents are responsible for

28:29.527 --> 28:35.897
that? In teaching us self-discipline. 
Self-discipline. And teaching us...

28:46.546 --> 28:51.231
how to get along with people.

28:57.979 --> 29:13.857
It's just, Papa was, especially Mama, Mama

28:57.979 --> 29:13.857
talked to us about home life, families, and to get 
along. But I think the biggest thing,

29:17.107 --> 29:19.650
self-discipline and to work. Just work.

29:24.416 --> 29:25.137
A work ethic. Just the idea of working. You work. 
Whatever you need, you have to work for. You can't

29:30.523 --> 29:34.247
just expect people to hand you something.

29:35.609 --> 29:37.732
Because all my brothers worked. Even my sister. 
They're all very successful, grown people now.

29:44.279 --> 29:45.020
They worked at it. Everybody worked. Nobody... 
Hard workers. Hard workers, and loved their

29:47.291 --> 29:50.416
country. Papa, boy, he'd talk to us about love of 
America all the time. But I think the thing was

29:55.885 --> 30:05.540
self-discipline and work and honesty, be honest.

30:12.651 --> 30:13.472
That's it. Let's move on then to your education. 
Can you tell me about your early years? Sure. I went

30:20.804 --> 30:25.088
to Millard Elementary School. First through 
the... Millard? M-I-L-L-A-R-D. Millard

30:26.710 --> 30:37.102
Elementary School, which was in the neighborhood 
about four blocks from, five blocks from where we

30:26.710 --> 30:37.102
lived. And that was through the first through the 
fifth grade. And then went to Dick Dowling Junior

30:40.866 --> 30:44.590
High And it was, uh, uh, Millard was east where we 
live, and Dowling was, uh, Dick Dowling was west.

30:52.850 --> 30:53.691
Is that what his name? Dick Dowling, junior high. 
Yeah, they, Dick Dowling. The road here? Oh,

30:57.936 --> 30:58.596
Dowling? No, that's D-O-W-L-A. Dick Dowling was a 
great Texas hero. Uh, he, uh, fought for the

31:03.782 --> 31:08.347
independence of Texas. Along with Bowie and 
Travis and, oh yeah, David Crockett. We have two

31:13.693 --> 31:15.555
junior high schools here. One was named David 
Crockett, and that was in the south end, and Dick

31:15.856 --> 31:24.184
Dowling, which was in the north end where we lived 
north, sort of north end of Bowman. And then I went

31:24.464 --> 31:27.867
to Bowman High School, 11 grades. Bowman High at 
that time had only 11 grades. Really? That's

31:31.110 --> 31:31.531
right. And not 12? Not 12. Why was that? I don't 
know. They just changed 12 here, what, maybe 15

31:35.174 --> 31:42.181
years ago. It had not always been 12. It was 11. So 
when I finished high school, I was barely 16 years

31:46.501 --> 31:53.749
old. I think I just made 17 in February.

32:01.138 --> 32:02.840
But when I went to A&M, I was 19. I had to lay out two 
years, which I'm really glad. I had to wait till my

32:06.804 --> 32:09.748
older brother graduated from A&M before I could 
go. Because of? Economics. Oh, sure. And Jimmy,

32:15.391 --> 32:16.612
too. Jimmy had to wait a couple years before he went 
to A&M to let Pete, let Janelle get along in grades

32:16.712 --> 32:29.565
before they could help each other with expenses.

32:32.288 --> 32:34.410
But all my schooling was right here in Boulder. 
Okay, what were your favorite subjects or topics?

32:36.812 --> 32:39.014
What did you like in school? Basketball.

32:42.057 --> 32:43.018
Oh, I liked...

32:45.935 --> 32:47.637
Gee, I don't know. I'm trying to think about it. 
History. History was, I liked history. And math

32:55.027 --> 32:59.233
was not one of my favorites. I learned to do math and 
chemistry. I learned it, but they weren't,

33:02.697 --> 33:08.745
chemistry was a, I enjoyed chemistry later on. But 
geography and history. I did very well with those.

33:15.302 --> 33:17.064
I liked those. What type of student were you? I was a 
very conscientious student, which I learned from

33:19.347 --> 33:23.451
my daddy. And then something else, too, I learned. 
Not to miss school. I had an unbelievable

33:28.157 --> 33:32.542
attendance record. Eleven years, almost perfect 
attendance. No kidding? No kidding. You didn't

33:36.267 --> 33:37.208
even get sick? I don't remember getting sick. If I 
did, I was in school. Because Papa made us go to

33:41.533 --> 33:43.515
school. Boy, if I missed one day of school, if I 
tried to miss one day of school, I knew what would

33:43.968 --> 33:49.975
happen. But I'm just, I had almost 11 years of 
perfect attendance going to school. And same way

33:58.204 --> 33:59.205
at A&M. I didn't miss class. Just to miss a class, 
it's unbelievable. I couldn't believe, I

34:03.770 --> 34:06.253
couldn't think about missing a class. Papa would 
whip me good. That brings us to another topic. What

34:12.119 --> 34:14.081
type of discipline did he use on you? Did he use 
physical or did he use more psychological

34:15.002 --> 34:19.206
methods? Did he twist your arm physically or 
mentally? I hate to use the word physical because

34:22.309 --> 34:25.052
it sounds like abuse. He never abused us, but we 
were paddled. Let me put it that way. We were

34:31.579 --> 34:32.340
paddled. Was he big enough to do it? No, but he was a 
man enough to do it. Papa wasn't too big, wasn't too

34:40.729 --> 34:46.815
tall, but yeah, we were disciplined. Good. All of 
us were. And it was always yes sir and no sir and yes

34:49.258 --> 34:55.725
ma'am and no talk back. Oh, couldn't dare talk back 
to either one of them.

35:02.933 --> 35:04.515
But Papa... We'll take discipline action against 
all of us. Were you involved, besides basketball,

35:08.795 --> 35:13.940
were you involved in other activities in high 
school? Yeah, I was a swimmer. In fact, I was on the

35:17.203 --> 35:19.225
swimming team at A&M. Really? Yeah. So you were on 
the basketball and the swimming team? Swimming. I

35:22.549 --> 35:23.269
was a diver. Art Adamson was a coach at A&M. I went 
out for breaststroke, and I was pretty good. But he

35:31.538 --> 35:34.941
had two better ones, three better ones, and he 
says, how about being a diver? Because he saw me

35:35.393 --> 35:37.395
dive, and I said, sure, I'll dive. And they 
overlap. Swimming and basketball overlap. The

35:41.840 --> 35:42.721
seasons did. And I would play basketball during 
the week, and then if I had a swim meet, I'd swim.

35:49.028 --> 35:52.212
Coach Corot was my coach, and he said, oh, that's 
all right. Go ahead. I didn't mind. I didn't try to

35:57.578 --> 36:00.421
play baseball or try it. I just stuck with 
basketball and swimming in high school. And then,

36:05.971 --> 36:09.716
don't mad, but I was cheerleader three years. A 
yell leader? Yeah, well, at A&M, I mean, at high

36:10.857 --> 36:13.080
school. Oh, really? Yeah, yell leader, you're 
right. But we called them cheerleaders then. That

36:18.907 --> 36:23.153
was my freshman year in high school, ninth, and 
then the tenth and eleventh. Really? I was the

36:24.715 --> 36:29.561
first freshman cheerleader Beaumont High's ever 
had. I don't know why. I was a good tumbler. I could

36:32.925 --> 36:34.527
do flips. Was it unusual to have a male cheerleader 
back then? No. You had two males and two females.

36:41.672 --> 36:42.273
You had four. And so they decided my freshman year, 
because I was so small, they'd have five. And I was a

36:47.519 --> 36:50.102
freshman cheerleader. And I used to do the flips 
and backflip, frontflips, and handsprings. And

36:55.628 --> 37:02.455
then after that, they had a freshman cheerleader. 
We always had five. Would

37:05.827 --> 37:11.155
you consider yourself popular in high school? 
Yes, I would. I was popular. I was president of the

37:14.561 --> 37:16.644
student council. No kidding? My senior year in 
high school. So, in other words, you were an

37:18.948 --> 37:25.518
organizer and somewhat of a leader from an early 
age. I would say that. I mean, not trying to, you

37:26.920 --> 37:31.227
know... In retrospect, yes, I didn't realize it at 
the time, but I was a leader. I guess I was. You were

37:39.646 --> 37:41.208
an activist then, really. Yeah, well, I was 
captain. You were in activities. I was captain of

37:45.873 --> 38:01.129
the basketball team, and I was head cheerleader 
two years, and I was president of the student

37:45.873 --> 38:01.129
faculty advisory group in high school. I wasn't a 
very high academic. I made good grades, but I...

38:06.638 --> 38:11.044
What do you mean? B's and C's? B's and C's. But I was, 
yeah, I guess you could say I was very active in high

38:16.112 --> 38:24.064
school. I'm just trying to remember some other 
things I... Were all your brothers this active in

38:28.497 --> 38:30.660
high school? Were they all leaders? They were all 
pretty well active, right. They weren't...

38:36.930 --> 38:43.020
Janelle was on the baseball team in high school. 
Jimmy was a boxer. And Andrew was on the varsity

38:45.644 --> 38:51.212
basketball team with me at the same time. And he was 
also a cheerleader, too. That's right, he was a

38:53.295 --> 38:56.260
cheerleader. Yeah. And... So it's a whole family 
then, of very active people and

38:57.472 --> 39:06.184
community-oriented people. Oh yeah, we were very 
community-oriented and very active. And this

39:12.252 --> 39:17.639
continued off into our adulthood. It's 
interesting when leaders start thinking of

39:21.907 --> 39:28.613
themselves as leaders and at what time in their 
lives they start to take a leadership role. I mean,

39:29.734 --> 39:39.463
some people don't start until they're in their 
20s, and some people can never remember when they

39:29.734 --> 39:39.463
weren't involved in a group or on the board of 
directors. It's going all the way back from junior

39:39.763 --> 39:43.447
high all the way through. I think, Terry, the thing 
that probably, as I look back now, that started me

39:43.987 --> 39:51.694
in this direction I won the, in the fifth grade, I 
won the, I was 11 years old, I guess, the American

39:52.889 --> 40:03.678
Legion Citizenship Award. Really? And that was 
the... That's significant. That was the first

40:06.821 --> 40:12.666
American Legion Citizenship Award given in 
Beaumont, Texas. And I was at Mellon School. And

40:19.772 --> 40:22.474
from that day on, I guess that kind of started me in 
the leadership role. Well, how did you win now? Why

40:29.637 --> 40:30.499
did they pick you? I don't know. Well, of course, I 
was a good student, and I was polite and nice and

40:31.620 --> 40:44.360
obedient, and I was on a basketball team in 
elementary school, and I worked. We did cleanup

40:44.641 --> 40:50.149
work around the school, and I was... I

40:51.513 --> 41:04.029
guess from that day on, I began to get into kind of a 
leadership path in junior high. Junior high, the

41:05.170 --> 41:11.358
same way I was captain of the junior high 
basketball team. And then

41:11.378 --> 41:20.389
representative on the student council. So I 
guess, yeah. Started at a very early age. Now when

41:25.928 --> 41:32.337
you graduated from high school, did you ever think 
of anything else but going to college? I mean, was

41:32.377 --> 41:34.060
there any other alternative? Or like you said, 
your father kept telling you you're going to

41:34.080 --> 41:37.885
college. Did you ever think of any other 
alternative? Not really, except I didn't know

41:41.250 --> 41:43.994
when I was going to go. Yeah. Couldn't afford it. 
Couldn't afford it. I finished in 37, high school

41:48.030 --> 41:54.580
in 37, and I had to work. I knew I had to work a year or 
two before my old brother got out of A&M, and he got

41:54.941 --> 42:05.997
out, and Jimmy, I had to wait until he was his 
senior. So I didn't know when, but I knew I was going

42:06.178 --> 42:11.165
to go to college because Papa wouldn't, he 
wouldn't think of anything else. Even though I

42:11.606 --> 42:12.988
was, I finally worked Worked into a good job in 
Beaumont. I worked for the Gulf State Utility

42:15.578 --> 42:19.343
Company. I had a good job. And could have stayed. 
Papa said, no, you're going to go to where? You're

42:25.411 --> 42:26.172
going to school. You're going to A&M, he would say. 
You're going to A&M. So I said, okay. So, 39. Jimmy

42:34.703 --> 42:35.705
was senior then. That's when I went off to school. 
And the odd thing about it, McQuillan was coach of a

42:37.507 --> 42:42.033
basketball team. He told me that when I got there, 
that he would give me a part-time scholarship,

42:43.681 --> 42:49.910
even though it was a two-year lapse. And so then 
when I got there, the coach gave me a scholarship,

42:51.172 --> 43:00.766
and I was kind of surprised because it was two years 
from high school. That was a great deal. Yeah. In

43:04.927 --> 43:13.859
other words, you'd say that you always had a rather 
firm goal in mind after you graduated from high

43:04.927 --> 43:13.859
school? High school, right. No question about it. 
I had a goal and I needed to fulfill that goal. Now we

43:21.670 --> 43:29.601
talked a little bit about how the Depression 
affected your family. like waiting until you were

43:29.935 --> 43:36.024
19 before you could go to A&M, and the idea of hard 
work. Is there any other way in which this great

43:36.284 --> 43:41.352
economic catastrophe had an impact on your life? 
Besides the fact that you were poor and you were

43:43.174 --> 43:47.380
dead. Your dad lost his business. Yeah, Papa lost 
his business, sure. He lost his business. It just

43:51.446 --> 43:56.213
taught us to... to be prudent about the way we live. 
We don't live high, you know, try to do with what

43:59.525 --> 44:04.951
we've got. Yeah,

44:05.372 --> 44:13.261
it's a story. Do you think you're more frugal 
because of the Depression? Are you more

44:16.624 --> 44:19.908
conservative with your money today? My father 
certainly has used the Depression. He can't spend

44:23.212 --> 44:24.854
a cent. Oh yeah, I've We're all that. All my 
brothers are that way. And sometimes it's not good

44:30.674 --> 44:34.839
because I got a couple brothers that have done very 
well. Oh, yeah. I got a bachelor's brother,

44:36.802 --> 44:38.344
Andrew. He's done very well. But he lives... And my 
older brother, Pete. See, I keep calling him Pete

44:46.475 --> 44:48.898
and I don't want to call him Pete. His name is 
Janess. But Mama called him Janelle, so we call him

44:51.001 --> 44:54.265
Janelle. But anyway... he's made a lot of money off 
of it but he's very frugal about his way of life he's

44:57.432 --> 45:25.650
got five kids he's got four girls and a boy and he 
teaches them the same thing but I would say the

44:57.432 --> 45:25.650
depression taught me to to use everything I got 
fully, not just buy a suit and say, I don't like the

45:26.744 --> 45:36.957
color, I'll buy another one. You want to take a 
break right now? Sure.
