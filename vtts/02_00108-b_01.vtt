00:02.360 --> 00:12.711
Now you seem to be describing a campus which was 
comparatively free of bias and prejudice. Is that

00:12.731 --> 00:13.331
correct? Well, I would say that there was no overt 
conduct of that nature.

00:28.432 --> 00:32.798
Because, I mean, I think being an Aggie was very 
important to everybody. It's more or less when you

00:32.838 --> 00:41.609
group people together, and I had always felt a part 
of the Aggie family. I think there had been, most of

00:43.091 --> 00:54.225
the wrath that came at that time, again, given the 
historical perspective, was a lot from the core

00:43.091 --> 00:54.225
versus the non-rag. And so... We had heard that 
there were students who were being quadded on San

00:57.997 --> 01:16.663
Jacinto Day, which was a day, as you know, where Sam 
Houston defeated Santa Ana. And it was done along

01:17.144 --> 01:22.772
the same kind of line of the quadding they did when 
if it was your birthday or if it was some other day.

01:27.711 --> 01:33.757
So some of us kind of felt uncomfortable about 
that.

01:38.181 --> 01:51.493
I don't think that we, you saw a, I never saw the 
Confederate flag flown, not that that represents

01:38.181 --> 01:51.493
any kind of bigotry or any kind of negative 
feeling. But you never saw people using, at least I

01:51.828 --> 02:05.047
never heard, derogatory terms about African 
Americans or Hispanics. It was just an air of

02:07.109 --> 02:15.321
disconnectedness, and I think that was what was 
happening. I don't think that the administration

02:17.174 --> 02:37.794
fully, fully understood that as these cultures 
were coming together, especially during the 60s,

02:17.174 --> 02:37.794
late 60s, and there was a whole segment of the 
community across the state that was saying,

02:17.174 --> 02:37.794
Hispanics, you are, assert your rights, assert 
your rights. Well, that's going to impact

02:38.275 --> 02:40.197
students. I don't think that there was a sense in 
the administration to say, We need to be doing

02:44.630 --> 02:49.018
something to transition or to make sure that 
there's some connectivity. I think as we began to

02:49.499 --> 02:59.096
raise these concerns, the university responded 
by saying, OK, well, if you're committed to an

02:49.499 --> 02:59.096
organization of this sort, we'll work with you. 
And of course, they funded that. And it's still in

03:00.338 --> 03:01.239
existence. It's been in existence over 25 years. 
Did you ever experience either an intentional or

03:04.087 --> 03:17.682
unintentional verbal misstatement, ethnic 
statement, by a faculty member, say, in a class or a

03:04.087 --> 03:17.682
lecture? Do you remember anything anybody said? 
No. No, I didn't. It's interesting because I did

03:21.846 --> 03:27.752
later as a graduate student, but not as an 
undergrad.

03:30.255 --> 03:33.098
But as an undergrad, never. Because I think there 
was a, and I think this professor who used the word

03:33.652 --> 03:55.693
wetback in one of his classes, he was not using it, 
he was using it in a, it was a wage and salary class,

03:33.652 --> 03:55.693
and he was, we were describing contract labor, we 
were describing how you determine wages and

03:33.652 --> 03:55.693
salaries, and he said, Well, this assumed a case 
study in XYZ, and he says, now, none of these are

03:56.095 --> 04:10.349
wetbacks, meaning, in his mind, they're not just 
being hired off the street or without any kind of

03:56.095 --> 04:10.349
rules. He was trying to say it in a clinical 
context, but I later on found out he was not a Texan,

04:11.891 --> 04:22.481
and I think he had picked up the word as a word to use 
to describe. And didn't even know what he was

04:22.721 --> 04:25.444
saying. You know, it was kind of, but it was not in a, 
he did not use it in a derogatory sense, more as a

04:25.947 --> 04:38.893
descriptive,

04:25.947 --> 04:38.893
because that's what, in fact, I had the same thing 
happen in law school. one of my professors

04:39.143 --> 04:43.148
describing the situation, he used the word 
wetback. Well, this is in Washington, D.C. And he

04:43.189 --> 04:51.680
had no clue that that had negative connotations in 
certain parts of Texas. I'm grinning because a

04:52.361 --> 05:03.596
couple, three weeks ago, I filled in for John Hoyle 
in one of Tony Brown's classes for the doctors of

04:52.361 --> 05:03.596
veterinary medicine, meat inspectors. Oh, yeah. 
And by the time we get to this incident I'm going to

05:07.898 --> 05:26.025
mention everybody was fairly well acquainted and 
here's a big good natured black man and I was trying

05:07.898 --> 05:26.025
to get them to think of terms that they should not 
use or if they did to be very very careful in how they

05:07.898 --> 05:26.025
used them And I was saying that the word for people 
of African ancestry that is easiest to use without

05:27.187 --> 05:38.561
any problem is to say the word black. I said, you 
can't mispronounce it. Black and white is

05:40.523 --> 05:42.966
parallel. Because I said, if you use the word 
negro, that can get mispronounced a bit and so

05:43.487 --> 05:49.414
forth. Well, about this time, this good-natured 
black man raises his hand. Big, well-fed. And he's

05:54.680 --> 05:56.923
saying, well, that reminds me of one. I can't 
understand why rednecks get unhappy if one of us

05:57.173 --> 06:04.424
uses that term. Because after all, they call each 
other rednecks. Why can't the rest of us? Well, the

06:09.492 --> 06:16.323
whole room exploded in laughter at him and 
started... And he was going, oh! And it was as if, my

06:17.044 --> 06:20.449
goodness, I never thought of that. And they were 
teasing him about, you know... And I told him, I

06:24.055 --> 06:35.873
said, well, the equivalent on this campus would be 
those of us that have a long tie to Texas A&M, we

06:24.055 --> 06:35.873
enjoy telling Aggie jokes. But we sure don't want 
somebody wearing an orange T-shirt to tell an

06:35.893 --> 06:43.665
Aggie joke, particularly if it's in front of a 
large crowd of other than Aggies. And he began to

06:44.166 --> 06:46.890
say, oh, okay, shake his head. All right, in that 
same era, we're at war in Vietnam. What do you

06:52.642 --> 07:00.970
remember during those days about the protests and 
so forth on the campus, if any? The only thing I

07:02.071 --> 07:09.137
remember was there was a move towards a war 
moratorium. And students wore black bands around

07:10.598 --> 07:16.844
their arms. And that was the most that one ever saw. 
Quite frankly, you could you could be at A&M and not

07:22.662 --> 07:26.107
realize that there was a war. I mean, one could say 
that in a negative and positive way. I

07:29.573 --> 07:34.841
don't think there was a question that... I mean, 
the sense of loyalty was, I guess, what...

07:40.060 --> 07:45.748
permeated the whole thing that, you know, we're 
the United States, we're at war, let's support it.

07:46.069 --> 07:47.050
It was that mindset. And so those who were seeking 
to wear their armbands, and I remember seeing some

07:47.531 --> 08:02.012
students, you know, you didn't see people 
harassing them or chastising them, you know, but

07:47.531 --> 08:02.012
they were a few that would wear their armbands. And 
of course, that in itself was somewhat of a radical

08:02.032 --> 08:09.223
act

08:02.032 --> 08:09.223
on campus. Do you remember anything ever 
happening in a class that had anything to do with

08:09.558 --> 08:14.719
the protest? No. I think that would be like It would 
never happen. You would never think it would

08:21.457 --> 08:23.520
happen anyway. You began as a freshman in Mr. 
Rutter's last year. Did you as a student have any

08:28.728 --> 08:31.493
impression of him? If so, what was your 
impression? Well, I think all of us who had grown up

08:33.676 --> 08:39.465
around this area particularly had a lot of 
admiration for him. He was considered a very...

08:39.625 --> 08:47.277
His name, Olin Teague, all those were very honored 
men at the time and I remember meeting General

08:48.303 --> 08:54.429
Rudder once. I can't remember what the occasion 
was. It was some function and shook hands and of

08:57.072 --> 09:07.803
course I felt quite honored and quite much, you 
know, felt like, wow, this is a real moment. And so,

09:08.905 --> 09:12.809
I mean, I think there was a, it was that sense. I 
mean, it was, I guess back in the 60s was the days

09:12.829 --> 09:16.993
where you could tell these stories of heroes and 
still feel good about it and not be cynical about,

09:18.239 --> 09:25.068
you know, that we have heroes, and he was one of 
those. All right, then he died, and after General

09:25.288 --> 09:30.895
Ludeke was the interim, Jack Williams became 
president. Did you have any interaction with him?

09:33.258 --> 09:37.984
Yes, not as a student, but later as assistant 
director of admissions. What was your impression

09:38.184 --> 09:39.306
of him? Oh, I thought he was brilliant. He was quite 
an eloquent man. He had a tremendous voice. I mean,

09:46.114 --> 09:46.575
his I don't know if you want to call it baritone or 
something. He had a great way of communicating. I

09:51.791 --> 09:58.680
remember one commencement exercise, because I 
had to help be a marshal at all these commencement

09:51.791 --> 09:58.680
exercises. I remember a speech on Murphy's Law. 
And I don't know if you remember, but I remember

10:02.144 --> 10:05.369
hearing that. And of course, he was hilarious. I 
mean, in his dry wit and his dry humor, he talked

10:06.770 --> 10:16.343
about Murphy's Law and all the different laws that 
would follow. I also had occasion to,

10:16.913 --> 10:34.030
I applied for a job when I was, I had been working 
here and I applied for a job with the chancellor's

10:16.913 --> 10:34.030
office. And I was not the strongest candidate, but 
I was a strong candidate. And another person got

10:44.660 --> 10:46.482
selected. And so I wrote him a letter saying, Dr. 
Williams, I just want to tell you that I am very

10:46.867 --> 10:59.703
interested in working with the university. And it 
was a positive letter. I wanted to give it a

11:02.807 --> 11:04.890
positive spin. And I said, I wanted just to let you 
know that I appreciate you considering my

11:05.671 --> 11:11.558
application. and look forward to working in the 
future with the administration, something like

11:11.723 --> 11:17.551
that. And I just let it go. But then about a week 
later, he wrote me a letter. It's his personal

11:24.601 --> 11:26.524
letter. It's, Danielle, I want to thank you for 
your leadership. I mean, it made me feel good. He

11:32.752 --> 11:37.298
says, and let me assure you, your future is very 
bright here at Texas A&M. Signed, Jack K. Wilkes.

11:41.727 --> 11:42.708
It made me feel great. I mean, so, and of course, as 
things happened a year later, a year and a half

11:42.808 --> 11:49.977
later, vacancy came up. I applied and got 
selected. So, you know, those things you can't

11:54.603 --> 11:59.389
forget because those are very important. And so 
it's those little moments that you, and of course,

12:00.311 --> 12:09.422
one time when I met him at the Citizens Building, it 
was almost as if you were going to see God, because

12:09.908 --> 12:31.536
in a huge systems administration building, and of 
course I never had been in a huge, magnificent

12:09.908 --> 12:31.536
building like that before, and you saw him sitting 
there, and it was a great feeling to know him. And of

12:31.576 --> 12:38.526
course, you'd see him later, he was with the 
congressman, or he was with this or that, so you

12:31.576 --> 12:38.526
felt good about having talked to him. I was like, in 
my early twenties. Did you think he had a sense of

12:40.881 --> 12:42.598
humor? Yeah, he did. I think he did. I think he had a 
good sense of humor. Again, I liked his dry wit.

12:52.560 --> 12:57.706
What struck me was he's not comical, but he was very 
humorous. I mean, he could say things, and it had so

12:57.986 --> 13:10.341
much humor in it, but he kept his dignity about him, 
which is something that I guess some people lose

12:57.986 --> 13:10.341
when they're trying to be comical or being 
humorous. At Clemson, his nickname was Smiling

13:10.321 --> 13:13.546
Jack. That's what the students called him because 
they thought that he was always upbeat and

13:13.566 --> 13:20.636
positive. Let's see. No particular relations 
with any of the deans while you were a student. No.

13:32.774 --> 13:34.817
Nor board members or anything like that. Was... 
Did you and your buddies talk about Vietnam and

13:37.912 --> 13:42.339
what effect that might have on you? Well, yeah. My 
lottery number was 239. And the year that the

13:47.506 --> 13:54.918
lottery went in when I was, it went as high as 199. 
And I remember sitting and listening on the radio

13:54.938 --> 14:01.307
and they were announcing these over the radio. And 
I guess I just sort of like had a, feeling the

14:07.055 --> 14:10.900
relief, like, wow, my number's not going to be 
reached. Because they had said a certain number as

14:10.920 --> 14:15.206
far as they're going to go. I didn't,

14:15.766 --> 14:23.797
you know, it's strange, but I don't remember very, 
very many who went to Vietnam from here. Now, of

14:25.359 --> 14:27.642
course, they may have and never came back. But, you 
know, Brine County Station was a pretty sleepy,

14:27.822 --> 14:34.210
quiet town at that time. And what time do you need to 
leave? In about another minute. Oh, okay. Well,

14:38.213 --> 14:39.116
let's stop right here. Okay. Let's stop here. 
Okay.

14:44.231 --> 14:47.220
Yeah, I've got a couple of things I need to do.
