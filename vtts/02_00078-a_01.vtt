WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:03.614
You want to close the door, Mary?

00:04.497 --> 00:05.741
Okay.

00:05.761 --> 00:06.403
Yeah, okay.

00:06.423 --> 00:06.724
Yes, sir.

00:06.744 --> 00:07.908
We're testing, testing.

00:07.948 --> 00:09.453
This is December 6th.

00:10.617 --> 00:11.459
Testing, testing.

00:11.941 --> 00:13.787
Testing, testing.

00:16.231 --> 00:17.512
This is December 6th.

00:17.573 --> 00:24.681
We're at 738 Garden Acres, and I'm about to interview Dr. Ted Franklin.

00:24.701 --> 00:29.446
Dr. Franklin, let's begin by your introducing yourself to this tape.

00:30.347 --> 00:33.491
Where did you grow up, go to high school, parents?

00:34.071 --> 00:34.752
What happened?

00:34.972 --> 00:37.916
Describe yourself before you came to A&M.

00:38.617 --> 00:45.124
I was actually born January 30th, 1918, in Wichita, Kansas.

00:45.712 --> 01:04.393
This was my father's beginning of the Kansas Black Lake Serum Company, which I might say was the first successful vaccine made in the United States, developed previously at Kansas State College at that time by O. M. Franklin & Associates.

01:05.354 --> 01:10.420
He later incorporated the company with cattlemen from Colorado and they

01:10.957 --> 01:21.273
They moved to Amarillo in 1918 and set up a new laboratory there and the headquarters in Denver, Colorado.

01:21.293 --> 01:30.147
And I have a book which I'll give you, Mr. Monroe Haskell, and you can read about it in there.

01:30.167 --> 01:36.357
Then I came to Amarillo at about four months of age with my mother and grandmother.

01:36.472 --> 01:52.627
Grew up there, two blocks from Highway 66 in West Amarillo, and went to high school, junior high, grade school, San Jacinto, junior high at Sam Houston, and later two years in Amarillo High School.

01:53.408 --> 02:04.639
We only had 11 grades in those days, so I graduated at the age of 17 and came here a year at junior college in Amarillo at that time, and then came here at the age of 18,

02:05.007 --> 02:07.810
late August of 1936 on a bus.

02:08.971 --> 02:10.172
Why did you come to A&M?

02:10.252 --> 02:11.634
Why here instead of somebody's help?

02:11.654 --> 02:21.684
Well, my father wanted, since he was a graduate of Kansas State and a veterinarian, class 1912, he wanted me to go to Kansas State and he could have gotten me a scholarship.

02:21.704 --> 02:25.949
But for some reason, I decided I was a Texan and I wanted to come to Texas A&M.

02:25.969 --> 02:29.612
So he didn't argue the points, so that's why I started.

02:29.632 --> 02:32.235
What did you know about A&M before you came?

02:33.296 --> 02:34.137
Practically nothing.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.405
I really didn't have a background in NM.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.250
Because you had not visited here.

02:39.430 --> 02:39.891
Never had.

02:40.212 --> 02:44.583
In fact, my friends in high school heard I was coming down here in South.

02:44.603 --> 02:45.786
They call it South Texas.

02:46.348 --> 02:48.092
Of course, it's Central Texas, but.

02:48.241 --> 02:50.223
They said, it never gets cold down there.

02:50.564 --> 02:58.413
The winter in January of 36 was much colder than any winter I'd ever spent in my life.

02:58.653 --> 03:01.477
It was wet here, and you know when it gets wet and cold here, how cold it is.

03:01.497 --> 03:02.438
I like to froze to death.

03:02.658 --> 03:04.981
We went in the dormitories in Hart Hall.

03:05.341 --> 03:08.866
We'd put newspapers on a radiator and sit on those radiators.

03:08.886 --> 03:14.012
Then if you wanted to get warm, you went in the shower and turned on the shower, and you would warm up.

03:14.052 --> 03:16.695
But that was the old sulfur water days.

03:17.266 --> 03:23.692
I often wondered how many million gallons went down the creek because no one turned those showers off for hours upon hours.

03:23.792 --> 03:25.814
They may run half the night or all night.

03:25.854 --> 03:27.875
I don't know.

03:27.996 --> 03:30.618
When you came to enroll, how did you get here?

03:31.278 --> 03:32.580
I came on a bus.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.400
I left Amarillo.

03:33.420 --> 03:43.129
I think it was about close to 11 o'clock, and my mother took me, and my brother went down, got on the bus, and I got here the next afternoon.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.632
Amarillo to Dallas.

03:46.865 --> 03:48.269
I don't think we went to Dallas.

03:48.309 --> 03:49.873
I think we came to Fort Worth and then.

03:49.893 --> 03:50.715
Fort Worth, okay.

03:50.976 --> 03:52.440
Yeah, that's a little shorter route.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.305
Do you remember what you brought with you?

03:54.726 --> 03:55.067
Yes.

03:56.712 --> 04:00.522
My trunk, I can still see that red trunk on top of the bus.

04:00.542 --> 04:03.169
It was up on top in those days.

04:03.942 --> 04:06.606
We came over here at the Aggieland Inn.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.569
Of course, no air condition in those days.

04:09.090 --> 04:09.891
We didn't know what that was.

04:10.512 --> 04:15.340
And drove up to where the old Aggieland Inn was on the campus, right by Sabisa Hall.

04:16.502 --> 04:22.011
A fellow named Babe, he was a Hispanic fellow that had worked there, I think, a long time.

04:22.532 --> 04:24.495
His name was Babe, and I don't have any love.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.117
But he helped me get that trunk off.

04:26.919 --> 04:30.945
Now, the interesting thing was that I can't remember just the trunk.

04:31.567 --> 04:38.994
where it went from there, but I spent the first night in Walton Hall, and I remember a senior came up and told me to do something.

04:39.014 --> 04:47.282
I kind of wondered what I was supposed to do, but I found out I was a freshman or beginning freshman, so whatever it was, I did it.

04:47.783 --> 04:49.264
That night I slept on a mattress.

04:49.284 --> 04:53.308
I had no sheets, and I remember it was kind of a hot night, so that's my first night at A&M.

04:53.328 --> 04:58.553
All right, then how did you get assigned to a core unit?

04:59.478 --> 05:14.354
Well, we went over, I guess it was first the old academic building, but I'm not for sure about that, but anyhow, they asked me what outfit I wanted to be in.

05:14.374 --> 05:26.768
I didn't really have an idea, but they said somehow I guess it was H Infantry is what the unit I was assigned to, and they said the Amarillo and Hill Country

05:27.558 --> 05:57.109
group is H Infantry and I said well that's alright sign me up in that so I was in H Infantry describe how where was H Infantry and describe how you were received by that group well of course I was a fish and yet I'd had a year in junior college so I still had the white stripe and was a fish on the campus and had no problem with that and we were in Hart Hall

05:57.494 --> 06:01.279
And it was a pretty new hall in those days because I think it was only built in the mid-30s.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.442
And so we were in the hard hall.

06:03.462 --> 06:04.743
I still remember my room number.

06:04.784 --> 06:06.326
It was C-13, I believe.

06:06.766 --> 06:10.831
We shared the... They were called the ramp system.

06:11.092 --> 06:13.335
And by the way, you know Brooks Cofer.

06:13.735 --> 06:14.777
I guess you'll interview him.

06:15.057 --> 06:15.698
I already have.

06:15.718 --> 06:16.018
All right.

06:16.058 --> 06:18.201
He told me why they built the ramp system.

06:18.241 --> 06:20.244
They were trying to reduce hazing that way.

06:20.324 --> 06:20.884
Is that correct?

06:21.585 --> 06:21.906
Okay.

06:21.946 --> 06:22.987
That's what he told me.

06:23.007 --> 06:27.433
Well, anyhow, I was up in the top... We had the top two stores of C, and then we had...

06:27.818 --> 06:31.383
D and E, I think.

06:32.264 --> 06:38.032
I believe we had three ramps, but half of C was ours, and then on the bottom two was G Company.

06:38.493 --> 06:47.945
We split the C ramp with G Company, and I can tell you about it's amazing there.

06:48.306 --> 06:53.573
Your first roommate, was he special?

06:53.789 --> 06:54.109
Where?

06:54.530 --> 06:55.430
Cuero, Texas.

06:55.491 --> 06:56.231
John Elzey.

06:56.712 --> 06:57.953
And he was lost.

06:58.153 --> 06:58.593
C-U-E-R-O.

06:58.613 --> 06:59.154
What was his name?

06:59.594 --> 07:01.776
John Elzey, E-double-L-Z-E-Y.

07:02.117 --> 07:07.301
I believe he was related to Green, Judge Green down there who might probably.

07:07.321 --> 07:08.482
Did he become a special friend?

07:09.283 --> 07:09.663
Yes.

07:10.384 --> 07:12.166
We were good friends, yeah.

07:13.047 --> 07:17.891
But after the second year, I didn't room with him.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.214
All right.

07:21.700 --> 07:27.394
How did you all get indoctrinated into the Corps?

07:27.414 --> 07:32.305
How did you learn all the Corps traditions and things that a new student was supposed to do?

07:32.606 --> 07:36.756
Well, I guess it was pretty informal.

07:37.428 --> 07:59.520
listened up for class when they told you what to do in those days there wasn't so much indoctrination i don't think you just picked it up and then we had we'd have yell practice at night over in front of the ymca and uh we learned the yells and things like that yeah did uh were you assigned some chores well yes i was freshmen were maids to

08:00.007 --> 08:01.528
You've heard that term before, a maid.

08:01.869 --> 08:04.931
I was a maid right across the hall to Dr. Redman.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.072
You've heard of Redman, of course.

08:06.693 --> 08:08.074
Harold Redman, who's a veterinarian.

08:08.114 --> 08:09.195
He's deceased.

08:09.215 --> 08:15.921
And a fellow from up in the hill country named Parker, and he'd come in the year before at midterm, so he was a frog.

08:16.241 --> 08:24.749
So I was maid to Harold Redman and Frog Parker, and they fought like cats and dogs, but they kept the room clean, so I didn't have a whole lot of work.

08:24.769 --> 08:27.071
And when did you do that room cleanup for them?

08:27.371 --> 08:29.693
Well, it would be in the morning.

08:30.145 --> 08:37.494
as I remember... Before Chow?

08:38.255 --> 08:40.218
I believe it was, yes.

08:40.238 --> 08:42.501
Or maybe it could have been a little in that afternoon.

08:42.541 --> 08:44.483
No, we had to have those rooms clean in the morning, I guess.

08:45.865 --> 08:51.953
And describe that fall a typical weekday.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.255
What time did you get up?

08:53.355 --> 08:54.476
What did you do when?

08:54.496 --> 08:57.300
Okay, the burglar, which I think, by the way,

08:57.837 --> 09:06.525
I'll put in a plug for having a little plaque or something put where he used to blow the bugler in my time, was right over beside of the YMCA building.

09:07.366 --> 09:08.988
And I think they ought to have a plaque there.

09:09.708 --> 09:12.651
But I was going to write for the Association, a former student.

09:13.232 --> 09:15.534
If you can put in a word for that, I'll appreciate it.

09:15.574 --> 09:16.255
I think you should be.

09:16.575 --> 09:19.458
At 6 o'clock every morning, that's when we woke up.

09:19.518 --> 09:24.723
The bugler blew the bugle day in rainy or shine, I guess it was.

09:24.743 --> 09:26.224
All right, then you'd take a shower.

09:27.048 --> 09:32.240
Well, I don't know if we always took a shower to be in, but we might have taken it the night before.

09:32.420 --> 09:40.298
But we got up, put our uniform on, and got presentable, and then I guess at 7 we marched to the mess hall.

09:41.088 --> 09:43.771
And we marched down to Cebiza.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.213
Down to Cebiza, yes.

09:45.233 --> 09:47.535
Were the new core dorms yet built?

09:47.555 --> 09:48.557
No, they weren't built for 38.

09:48.577 --> 09:48.677
Okay.

09:48.757 --> 09:50.319
I remember we saw those.

09:50.339 --> 09:51.420
And this is the fall of 36?

09:52.141 --> 09:52.581
Fall of 36.

09:52.601 --> 09:52.942
Fall 36.

09:53.322 --> 09:55.104
And then that was a terrible winter of 36.

09:55.485 --> 10:01.812
And 37, they had a big ice storm, and I changed the vet medicine during that ice, or at that time.

10:01.832 --> 10:06.117
I remember walking down to the veterinary building, the old, we're now civil engineering building.

10:06.097 --> 10:08.380
and there was about two inches of ice on the road.

10:08.600 --> 10:13.786
They said it was the worst ice storm in 50 years here that broke trees all over and everything.

10:13.806 --> 10:18.892
That would have been midterm, probably the latter part of January, middle of January sometime.

10:18.972 --> 10:20.193
Were classes dismissed?

10:21.114 --> 10:22.176
No, I don't think so.

10:22.957 --> 10:27.582
I don't think classes, I don't ever recall classes being dismissed because of the ice storm.

10:27.602 --> 10:34.450
I remember walking down, I changed to vet medicine at midterm of 37, and I remember walking down to the,

10:34.835 --> 10:37.319
the veterinary building to do that, the veterinary hospital.

10:37.499 --> 10:43.849
That first semester, do you remember some special classes you took or some special teachers that you met?

10:45.331 --> 10:57.130
Well, of course, we met Dr. Marsteller right to start with, and we all ended up going to, I guess the deans were all in what we call the administration building,

10:57.413 --> 10:58.515
Academic.

10:58.775 --> 11:01.439
It's now called the academic again.

11:01.519 --> 11:02.520
Is it called Jack Williams?

11:03.362 --> 11:03.422
No.

11:03.442 --> 11:04.864
Are you talking about the one with the dome?

11:05.084 --> 11:06.025
No, not the old main.

11:06.066 --> 11:06.987
We call that the main.

11:07.087 --> 11:08.509
The administration.

11:08.529 --> 11:09.090
The new one.

11:09.110 --> 11:11.694
The new one down with the pillars and you drive up in the front.

11:13.556 --> 11:16.641
I think all the students went to the various deans in that building.

11:16.921 --> 11:19.825
At least I remember the vet students went by Dr. Marsteller.

11:19.845 --> 11:23.871
He was sitting there at a table and he had two classic questions and you better have them.

11:24.132 --> 11:26.475
He said, do you have your medical dictionary?

11:26.455 --> 11:28.197
And do you have Sisson's Anatomy?

11:28.518 --> 11:32.683
And the boys, I don't know what happened to the ones that didn't say that, but I had mine.

11:32.723 --> 11:36.748
And Dr. Marstella, he could chew you out pretty good if he wanted to.

11:36.768 --> 11:39.211
Describe him as a person.

11:39.231 --> 11:45.138
Dr. Marstella, he was, well, in my day, he was gray-haired.

11:45.899 --> 11:55.551
And he was of a short stature, more or less, and rather not real big, but...

11:55.987 --> 12:15.109
fairly substantial man and of course he knew he knew who I was because my father see they all known about him so I was kind of about how many pre-vet students that would help us okay about how many pre-vet students were there then

12:16.861 --> 12:19.406
We were the largest class in 41.

12:19.727 --> 12:22.953
I would imagine there was at least 70 of them.

12:24.096 --> 12:24.697
Something like that.

12:24.717 --> 12:25.338
It was a big class.

12:25.959 --> 12:32.132
All right, so you… Whereas in 1930, Dr. Hardy was the one veterinary graduate here.

12:32.152 --> 12:32.974
Oh my goodness.

12:32.994 --> 12:33.595
Yeah, he's gone.

12:33.635 --> 12:34.116
He's been gone.

12:34.136 --> 12:37.603
All right, you…

12:37.921 --> 12:40.485
Where were most of your freshman year?

12:40.545 --> 12:41.906
Where did you take most of your classes?

12:41.927 --> 12:52.801
Well, the first semester, I was, like I say, I'd had fish work, so I wasn't in classes with fish, as we were called, and freshmen.

12:52.821 --> 12:54.784
And it was mostly with upperclassmen.

12:54.824 --> 12:58.970
I had, I remember chemistry, organic chemistry.

12:59.030 --> 13:05.599
I had that in, I don't, I think that was in the spring, though, but in the fall,

13:06.322 --> 13:12.333
I had, I guess, English, probably, and I don't think I had a history class.

13:12.974 --> 13:13.294
Math?

13:13.955 --> 13:15.398
Yeah, we had—well, wait a minute.

13:15.418 --> 13:16.800
No, I had freshman math.

13:18.063 --> 13:23.352
Golly, you know—oh, I had biology, yeah.

13:23.872 --> 13:25.494
And I remember a famous quote.

13:25.515 --> 13:26.516
You've heard of Dr. Doak?

13:27.498 --> 13:28.920
He made this statement one time.

13:28.960 --> 13:32.205
It was right before a corps trip.

13:32.545 --> 13:33.587
And I had him in class.

13:34.168 --> 13:36.291
And he made the statement.

13:36.311 --> 13:39.316
He said, you call the roll, you know, and there was some absent.

13:39.336 --> 13:44.023
And he said, well, if there was a corps trip to hell, there'd be Aggies leaving three days ahead of time.

13:44.003 --> 13:47.267
So that's a quote from Dr. Doak.

13:47.307 --> 13:48.488
He was an old Aggie, yeah.

13:48.929 --> 13:57.038
Because I remember him telling us about they stole the rice owl, and this was back about right after World War I, and they chased him through the Brazos bottom and all that.

13:57.058 --> 13:59.982
Dr. Doak was... Was he one of the people who stole the rice owl?

14:00.162 --> 14:01.223
Well, he was in the group.

14:01.243 --> 14:05.068
He said he was chased through the Brazos, the Navisota bottom and all that.

14:05.088 --> 14:06.449
So I guess he was in on it.

14:08.231 --> 14:09.933
But he was quite a popular professor.

14:09.953 --> 14:10.754
Was he a good teacher?

14:11.095 --> 14:13.217
Yes, I'd say he was a very excellent teacher, yeah.

14:13.619 --> 14:24.394
During that first year, in the dining hall, what were the duties of a transfer student that first year?

14:24.814 --> 14:31.443
Well, see, I wasn't, I was just, transfer really didn't apply to me.

14:31.483 --> 14:33.166
We were just fish like everybody else.

14:33.446 --> 14:34.868
We had no special distinction.

14:34.848 --> 14:41.257
Well, we just had to wait until everybody got their things, and then we ate.

14:41.518 --> 14:52.513
I mean, we were all sophomores and freshmen were all here, but they would, of course they had these names, Gun Whiting for Bren, and Cow for Butter, and stuff like that.

14:53.214 --> 14:57.160
And there'd be a guy at the end of the table, say,

14:57.713 --> 15:00.415
especially as a freshman, say, pass the biscuits or something like that.

15:00.455 --> 15:03.618
And then probably a sophomore and everybody would help themselves.

15:03.658 --> 15:06.360
The biscuit might not be in him when it got to him.

15:06.661 --> 15:12.746
But then a sophomore would say, pass the gun water and then let it ride.

15:12.806 --> 15:14.768
That means you don't take stuff off.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.389
Don't take any off?

15:16.409 --> 15:17.630
Let it ride.

15:17.650 --> 15:24.816
Did you and your buddies that first year, did you all try to play any pranks on any upperclassmen in the dining hall?

15:26.198 --> 15:26.758
No.

15:27.650 --> 15:33.606
They didn't, I don't ever, but I've carried many a pie out.

15:34.328 --> 15:36.615
By the way, I can tell you an interesting story on that.

15:36.635 --> 15:42.992
There was a little enlisted man, Sergeant, it wasn't Richard now, what was his name?

15:44.592 --> 15:46.073
Golly, it doesn't come to me right now.

15:46.093 --> 15:50.277
But he was a shark sergeant on the door at that time, an enlisted man.

15:50.678 --> 16:01.728
He never stopped me, but especially on Sunday morning, sophomores would want you to bring a pie out for them, so you'd put it under your trench coat and go out with a pie or something like that.

16:02.188 --> 16:04.931
But anyhow, Tad Moses, did you ever know Tad?

16:05.431 --> 16:10.676
All right, well, see, Tad was editor of the Cattlemen, and my father's company always advertised.

16:10.696 --> 16:11.477
They were the...

16:11.457 --> 16:13.879
for years and years they were the second page of the cattlemen.

16:14.139 --> 16:26.931
So he knew about me and I got acquainted with Tad down there and he told me that this little sergeant, I'll think of it sometime, and Tad, Moses' brother, were on Bataan when it fell.

16:27.531 --> 16:29.313
And they went gorilla.

16:29.793 --> 16:36.099
They went to the hills and they almost made it through but right at the last somebody informed on the Japs gunman.

16:36.719 --> 16:36.979
That is it.

16:37.260 --> 16:38.501
But Tad told me that story.

16:38.521 --> 16:41.143
That his brother and this sergeant

16:41.427 --> 16:42.732
Oh, God, I knew his name.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.418
I can't think of it.

16:44.438 --> 16:51.302
Now, what was it like to smuggle a pie out of the... Could you get it out without getting it all over your shirt?

16:51.755 --> 16:59.546
Yeah, I'm trying to think how we did that, but we didn't seem to have any trouble putting the pies in there and carrying them out.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.690
But sometimes we got caught.

17:01.710 --> 17:17.873
In another instance, I remember this one in our outfit, another outfit, there were two sophomores with this freshman, and they were just taking this hot pepper sauce, just loading this pie, and making this poor freshman eat it, and he was about to become a part of it.

17:17.894 --> 17:20.277
Well, the same sergeant I'm trying to think of,

17:21.607 --> 17:24.330
gosh, saw this incident.

17:24.350 --> 17:33.039
So when the freshman finally got in all he could take and went off, he got these two guys, these sophomores, and collared them, put them down and did the same thing.

17:34.901 --> 17:39.746
If you got caught trying to smuggle a pie out of the dining hall, what happened?

17:40.006 --> 17:42.288
I think you got what they call rams, demerits.

17:42.308 --> 17:42.629
Oh, okay.

17:42.649 --> 17:44.291
I think that's what you got.

17:44.311 --> 17:46.193
And, of course, you didn't get to take the pie out.

17:46.453 --> 17:49.136
But I don't think too many guys got caught.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.517
It just depends on his.

17:50.986 --> 17:55.979
Beginning that year, what were your favorite Aggie dining hall foods?

17:56.060 --> 17:57.203
What did you enjoy most?

17:58.727 --> 18:00.131
Be honest with you, Haskell.

18:00.151 --> 18:04.884
The first, let's see, who was still in charge then?

18:06.468 --> 18:07.290
Was it Mr. Duncan?

18:07.895 --> 18:09.056
Yeah, I think it was Duncan.

18:09.637 --> 18:10.657
The food wasn't very good.

18:10.918 --> 18:11.418
Really?

18:11.438 --> 18:11.959
Yeah, it wasn't.

18:12.459 --> 18:17.663
Some of it was all right and some of it better, but when Hotard came, we noticed an immediate improvement in the food.

18:17.683 --> 18:19.805
In fact, we started getting hot biscuits and stuff.

18:20.806 --> 18:22.488
So it went up quite a bit.

18:22.628 --> 18:30.535
Before you came down here, did your parents give you any advice about being a college student, being an Aggie or anything?

18:30.695 --> 18:31.716
No, no.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.038
My dad wasn't one to give advice.

18:34.098 --> 18:36.720
He learned from him more by example than he did advice.

18:37.055 --> 18:38.818
All right.

18:38.838 --> 18:40.882
What were the major buildings when you got here?

18:42.565 --> 18:46.933
Well, the post office wasn't built until 38 up there on the corner.

18:47.314 --> 18:52.043
Sebesa Hall, the Aggieland, Ramadi Inn,

18:52.259 --> 18:54.341
Yeah, it was called Rimata Inn, wasn't it?

18:54.361 --> 18:55.262
No, just Aggieland Inn.

18:55.582 --> 18:57.224
Aggieland Inn, I'm sorry, yeah.

18:57.564 --> 18:59.366
Aggieland Inn, the hospital back behind it.

19:00.507 --> 19:04.570
Then the old campus theater was there, the old frame building.

19:04.971 --> 19:06.933
Then you had Foster and Ross, of course.

19:06.953 --> 19:09.415
You had Mitchell, Milner over there.

19:09.455 --> 19:10.796
You had the old bookstore.

19:11.357 --> 19:16.081
You had the red brick building over there, BNCU across from the bookstore.

19:17.783 --> 19:18.744
Power plant, of course.

19:19.605 --> 19:21.186
And then the veterinary...

19:22.246 --> 19:49.705
still there at the veterinary hospital then there was a little uh kind of a shed by it at that time well i think there was originally old dr francis dissecting room and then the main old main with the dome and the dormitories and bezell hall we were then goodwin hall was there we we were i was a sophomore in goodwin hall and that was a cold winter i'm gonna tell you that old hall uh and uh guyon oh yeah guyon they called it gunion then

19:50.090 --> 19:51.071
Gunyon.

19:51.171 --> 19:52.192
You never heard it called Gunyon?

19:52.293 --> 19:52.673
No.

19:52.693 --> 19:54.675
Oh, yeah, that is called Gunyon.

19:54.896 --> 19:57.238
And I'll tell you a story about Gunyon later.

19:57.258 --> 19:58.280
And the YMCA.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.681
Oh, yeah, YMCA.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.283
And then Law and Perrier.

20:01.944 --> 20:05.668
And, of course, the MSC wasn't there.

20:06.810 --> 20:10.954
We didn't really have a place to meet except the YMCA.

20:12.076 --> 20:12.556
Let's see.

20:13.257 --> 20:15.760
Did you all have cush questions in the dining hall then?

20:16.820 --> 20:18.221
Kush questions.

20:18.241 --> 20:30.472
Later, those would develop, and these would be questions that a freshman would have to answer before he could eat his dessert, his Kush, and they were phrased so that there was never a correct answer.

20:31.933 --> 20:33.934
No, I don't think we had those in my day.

20:34.035 --> 20:36.917
Now, some outfits, you know, probably were different than others.

20:37.137 --> 20:38.839
Our outfits, it wasn't.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.020
What was special about your outfit?

20:41.101 --> 20:46.405
What did y'all... Well, Pinky Mabin, I don't believe he's still living, was the

20:46.790 --> 20:49.234
Then he would have been a senior in 37.

20:50.976 --> 20:52.038
He was a company commander.

20:52.679 --> 20:57.726
And he was a good guy, a military man.

20:57.786 --> 21:00.110
It was military.

21:00.130 --> 21:04.356
Of course, the freshmen, I mean, they still had hazing, of course.

21:04.716 --> 21:07.400
And some hazing, some people were worse than others.

21:09.023 --> 21:10.705
Did your outfit have a nickname?

21:13.958 --> 21:16.221
No, they just called infantry, paddle feet, you know.

21:16.462 --> 21:17.763
Okay.

21:18.484 --> 21:23.492
And what kind of hazing occurred in your outfit in the dormitory?

21:24.113 --> 21:24.874
Oh, with the paddle.

21:25.234 --> 21:33.326
But the worst was in G Company, there was a senior, Rodney Chambliss, and I think he later became sheriff over at Madisonville.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.629
They called him Bloody Rod.

21:36.250 --> 21:39.154
And he would really paddle those guys.

21:39.194 --> 21:42.279
But see, we could watch him, because we were in a different outfit.

21:42.299 --> 21:44.001
He couldn't touch us, but we could watch him.

21:44.262 --> 21:49.309
And he'd even pound when he left and came back as an ex-student.

21:49.329 --> 21:50.611
He'd even pound on the seniors.

21:50.631 --> 21:52.394
He was something.

21:52.414 --> 21:54.957
But I want to tell you, it's pretty sad.

21:55.017 --> 21:56.279
This fellow was from my hometown.

21:56.299 --> 21:57.862
I didn't know him until I got here.

21:57.882 --> 21:58.883
He was a sophomore.

22:00.179 --> 22:07.868
and he had this big picture of a girl that was in my high school class on his desk, and I guess he was deeply in love with her.

22:08.288 --> 22:17.859
Well, it's kind of sad, but anyhow, one morning he gets a newspaper clipping that this girl is eloped with somebody, and he didn't know it or anything.

22:17.879 --> 22:22.123
So the poor guy's in shock, and you know what his friends' sophomores did?

22:22.404 --> 22:26.949
They said all of us freshmen were to congratulate the guy, and he was, poor guy, was in shock.

22:27.369 --> 22:29.832
I felt bad about it, but anyhow, that's...

22:29.812 --> 22:34.900
Let's see, how did you all register for classes then?

22:35.060 --> 22:39.226
How did you, when I got here, you stood in line in Cebisa.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.030
Did you all register that way then?

22:43.312 --> 22:46.036
I don't think we ever registered in Cebisa.

22:47.037 --> 22:47.779
Well, how did you know?

22:47.799 --> 22:58.975
See, now, when I changed to vet medicine in the mid-semester of 37, we

23:00.187 --> 23:05.357
As I say, we had to go by the dean down in the administration building.

23:07.101 --> 23:11.549
But it could have been that we signed up down there.

23:11.569 --> 23:12.431
I just can't remember.

23:12.611 --> 23:14.034
Who approved your classes?

23:14.094 --> 23:14.575
Do you know?

23:15.197 --> 23:16.980
The dean or associate dean?

23:18.614 --> 23:19.375
Approved.

23:19.556 --> 23:22.782
Approved the ones that you had selected, the ones you were ready.

23:23.002 --> 23:26.629
Well, when we got into vet, we had to prescribe classes.

23:26.930 --> 23:31.097
But the electives, I guess, we just take them as we wanted them to.

23:31.618 --> 23:36.227
Because I took, when I finished, I believe, A&M, I had 200 hours.

23:36.568 --> 23:37.770
I'd had every course.

23:38.037 --> 23:46.826
in Animal Husband in those days, and then when I put in from a vet degree, the college overlooked it, and I did too, and I should have had a degree in Animal Husband, but I didn't get it.

23:46.846 --> 23:47.747
I had all those courses.

23:48.067 --> 23:55.195
When you, even beginning that first year, when you went to class, how did you and your buddies behave in class?

23:56.416 --> 23:57.937
Well, it was a military school.

23:58.778 --> 24:06.306
We just probably waited until somebody called on us, and that was it.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.890
mouth off or anything like that.

24:07.910 --> 24:10.173
Did you ever attempt any jokes in class?

24:12.176 --> 24:13.898
Or did you all behave pretty well?

24:14.258 --> 24:23.010
No, I think, as I recall, when you went to class, these professors that we had, they didn't put up the emphasis.

24:23.030 --> 24:24.032
And did you go regularly?

24:24.753 --> 24:25.574
Oh, yeah, yeah.

24:25.594 --> 24:26.535
I never missed class.

24:28.017 --> 24:32.563
Where did you go during the day if you had some free time?

24:33.961 --> 24:44.639
Well, once in a great while, down under, they've closed it off, but have you heard of the old, or what do they call it, where you got a soda down under the YMCA?

24:44.659 --> 24:45.721
Oh, uh-huh.

24:45.741 --> 24:47.243
Sparks, and somebody had that.

24:47.744 --> 24:56.318
And that, we'd get that, or we'd go to the library, maybe, or just go to somebody's room and shoot the bull or something like that.

24:56.859 --> 24:58.602
It wasn't any, it was pretty...

24:58.970 --> 25:03.862
open there, unless the sophomores had you doing something or something like that.

25:03.882 --> 25:05.546
Because you couldn't go to your room and sleep.

25:06.187 --> 25:08.092
No, you couldn't, not as freshmen.

25:08.693 --> 25:14.447
And did you ever have to do many chores for an upperclassman during the day?

25:16.300 --> 25:19.208
Between breakfast and supper, you didn't have to do many?

25:19.689 --> 25:21.494
No, there wasn't too much.

25:22.356 --> 25:29.314
If you were his maid, you might have to go do something, but generally speaking, yeah.

25:30.914 --> 25:31.415
Let's see.

25:32.616 --> 25:38.444
During all of your years here, who were some of the great teachers that you had?

25:38.645 --> 25:45.474
Well, I'd say Dr. Doak was one of them, Dr. Dunn in veterinary medicine, and Dr. Leonard.

25:45.754 --> 25:49.139
Describe them, Leonard and Dunn.

25:49.780 --> 25:52.804
Well, Leonard was, he was raised down here in

25:53.020 --> 25:56.365
I believe Schillenberg, something like that, down in there.

25:56.385 --> 26:05.499
Anyhow, he was a graduate of a private, the private schools sort of closed up right around World War I or thereafter, private veterinary school.

26:05.759 --> 26:08.543
And he was a graduate of Kansas City Veterinary College.

26:08.563 --> 26:12.970
And he was a lean man, but very, very good teacher.

26:13.030 --> 26:18.919
He knew the veterinary medicine of that day and time, which, you know, is not like that.

26:18.959 --> 26:19.720
What was his specialty?

26:20.138 --> 26:22.061
Well, he's a large animal clinician.

26:22.121 --> 26:26.687
He was just anything that needed to be operated on, the large animal field.

26:26.747 --> 26:27.448
That's Dr. Dunn.

26:27.748 --> 26:29.310
No, Leonard.

26:29.330 --> 26:30.031
He was a surgeon.

26:30.091 --> 26:36.820
Dunn was a pathologist, well, more bacteriologist, but he also, I think, was head of pathology at that time, too.

26:37.100 --> 26:45.471
But he came here to run the old serum lab, which I don't know if you remember that little building down there behind the administration building.

26:45.839 --> 26:48.003
That was originally the Hog Collar Serum Lab.

26:48.664 --> 26:51.228
And Dunn was brought here to run that.

26:51.248 --> 26:54.774
And that went until about 23, and then they closed it down.

26:54.854 --> 27:00.443
And then he became a faculty member and taught microbiology and veterinary microbiology for years.

27:00.483 --> 27:01.625
He was a very good man.

27:01.846 --> 27:04.170
Do you remember going to your first Aggie football game?

27:05.832 --> 27:08.697
You remember that first fall, what it was like going to an Aggie game?

27:08.817 --> 27:10.480
Yeah.

27:11.101 --> 27:13.725
Yeah, it was, of course, you know, nothing like today.

27:14.126 --> 27:15.948
Just the bleachers and all.

27:16.529 --> 27:20.836
But I do remember when Rosalden came here in the spring of 37.

27:21.617 --> 27:22.298
Describe that.

27:22.679 --> 27:23.160
All right.

27:24.462 --> 27:25.423
Now, here's the story.

27:25.724 --> 27:29.329
When I came here, the rifles, we got them on drill day.

27:29.349 --> 27:32.494
They were locked up in the bottom of Hart Hall in racks.

27:32.514 --> 27:34.117
You didn't have a rifle.

27:34.137 --> 27:35.378
I bet that's cold, isn't it?

27:35.419 --> 27:36.120
No, I'm doing fine.

27:36.180 --> 27:38.323
All right.

27:38.810 --> 27:45.073
So we got only the raffles on drill days, but the sophomores told us that the year before

27:45.239 --> 27:52.647
they had their rifles in the room and apparently live ammunition because they said they shot out Prexis Moon, which is the, you know, on top.

27:52.667 --> 27:59.895
And so, me growing up with guns and all, I'm surprised that there wasn't somebody shot or killed, but we didn't hear about that.

27:59.915 --> 28:09.306
They just said that the next year there were no rifles in the rooms, their firing pins had been taken out of the rifle, so they were harmless except to drill with.

28:11.294 --> 28:28.094
All right, then when President Roosevelt came... Yeah, in 37, he visited here, and we had our rifles in the uniform, and I was in the front row of Kyle Field there, and I guess the car came by, I know, further from here to the wall, with Dr. Walton in the back and President Roosevelt in the back.

28:28.614 --> 28:32.779
And I would guess there wasn't over four Secret Service men.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.181
trailing along behind him.

28:34.642 --> 28:39.348
And then we reviewed, then he was on the reviewing stand out on, now they call it Simpson Field, don't they?

28:39.368 --> 28:39.869
Drill Field.

28:39.889 --> 28:40.469
Drill Field.

28:40.670 --> 28:45.055
We reviewed, the Corps went reviewed past him, and so that was it.

28:45.416 --> 28:54.227
But the interesting thing, I was always kidding people, I said Roosevelt and I have a birthday the same day, and we did on January 30th, but anyhow we didn't ever celebrate together.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.734
Did any of y'all see him out of the car?

28:59.797 --> 29:01.559
Did you see that he was crippled?

29:01.579 --> 29:02.240
No, we didn't know.

29:02.401 --> 29:04.644
In fact, I didn't know that, I guess, for years later.

29:05.165 --> 29:08.590
He was already in the reviewing stand, I guess, when we got there.

29:08.770 --> 29:12.195
No, I didn't know he was crippled for a long time.

29:12.535 --> 29:13.937
Did he make a speech or anything?

29:15.800 --> 29:19.004
I don't believe he did.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.787
I think we just reviewed him.

29:21.748 --> 29:22.189
And...

29:22.827 --> 29:26.391
They drove all around Kyle Field in the big old touring car.

29:26.411 --> 29:35.562
All right, when you went to a football game in your student days, did you all march into the stadium like they do now?

29:36.924 --> 29:39.707
No, we didn't march in like they do now.

29:40.188 --> 29:47.316
We had Harry over there where the band sits pretty well now on the east side over there.

29:48.157 --> 29:50.537
No, I never remember moving.

29:50.557 --> 29:53.037
And did you stand up at the game?

29:54.012 --> 29:58.898
Yes, I believe we stood up, as I remember, practically most of the years.

29:58.918 --> 30:01.141
Describe a court trip back in those days.

30:01.161 --> 30:02.442
Well, I'll tell you one.

30:02.823 --> 30:06.547
We made to Austin, and I used to make the court trips, and we went on the train.

30:07.468 --> 30:14.537
To start with, the train wouldn't be pulling out of the station until some guys, and not that I was any angel, but I never did do it.

30:14.557 --> 30:15.218
I never got to it.

30:15.518 --> 30:19.783
They would have the toilet paper rolls out of the train wind holding them.

30:19.763 --> 30:21.686
And as the train went, this would unroll.

30:21.706 --> 30:28.575
So there never was a train that left Cottage Station in my dime that didn't have toilet paper streaming from the first car back to the end.

30:29.276 --> 30:30.919
And we went over to Austin.

30:30.939 --> 30:34.283
We'd go up, I think, to Hearn, and they put us on the Missouri Pacific tracks.

30:34.584 --> 30:38.990
We went to Austin, and I do remember it was a beautiful day in 38 over in Austin.

30:39.571 --> 30:46.841
We marched up Congress Avenue, and it was a beautiful day but cold, and I thought that rifle was freezing my shoulder.

30:46.861 --> 30:47.762
I remember that, yeah.

30:48.586 --> 30:54.475
And how did the crowd, when y'all marched on Congress Avenue, how did the crowd react to y'all?

30:54.495 --> 30:55.477
Were they respectful?

30:56.198 --> 30:56.959
Oh, I think so.

30:58.020 --> 31:01.486
To be honest, I can't remember too much, but I never remember any incident, no.

31:01.946 --> 31:05.372
And did you come back soon after the game, or did y'all spend the night, or do you know?

31:05.392 --> 31:09.618
Oh, no, we came back, got back on the train, came back.

31:09.718 --> 31:10.780
Yeah, we didn't spend the night.
