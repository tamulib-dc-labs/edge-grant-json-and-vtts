WEBVTT

00:03.710 --> 00:25.078
They would suggest that so-and-so needed to be on 
the bowling team or so-and-so needed to be on the

00:03.710 --> 00:25.078
music committee at the MSC or on SCONA or you need to 
run for freshman class treasurer or vice

00:03.710 --> 00:25.078
president. And then they would tell you, now 
here's the way you do it. or if it was an intramural

00:29.393 --> 00:52.212
we would get out and work out they'd work with the 
team on plays and how to succeed at athletics or at

00:29.393 --> 00:52.212
student recreational activities on campus or in 
the MSC so I was encouraged to go to every dorm and go

00:53.002 --> 01:05.048
in every freshman's room and whip out and spend a 
few minutes and remember their name, what their

00:53.002 --> 01:05.048
major was, and where they were from, their 
hometown. Now this was in terms of- This is in the

01:05.069 --> 01:12.124
fall because the freshman officers ran then in the 
spring. So during that first semester, of course,

01:13.336 --> 01:34.825
I'd been there in summer school, so some of the 
newness that everybody else was faced with, at

01:13.336 --> 01:34.825
least I was a little bit oriented to the 
environment, not to the core, but where things

01:13.336 --> 01:34.825
were and how to expedite certain activities. But 
that's what they told me to do, and I did. And so I got

01:39.712 --> 01:58.284
involved through that activity and then the 
entomology club over in the department and the

01:39.712 --> 01:58.284
church and a number of things that were not 
directly A&M related. Did you put up signs? No. And

02:01.610 --> 02:04.555
did... Don't ever remember any during... 55 
through 59 by advertising. You went around and

02:08.652 --> 02:10.455
introduced yourself. People knew everybody. And 
so you didn't have a rally, you didn't have a...

02:12.959 --> 02:17.768
Nope. We just went around just like the old 
politicians I guess used to and introduced

02:18.048 --> 02:29.428
yourself and visited with people and told them 
what you were concerned about and what you were

02:18.048 --> 02:29.428
going to do. And they made up their mind as to who 
they liked the best. Do you remember what your

02:33.759 --> 02:36.563
concerns were that freshman year? What you might 
have told them you were concerned about? No, I

02:39.308 --> 02:41.050
don't. And what was the vote? Do you remember how 
close it was? It was fairly close. As I remember,

02:49.144 --> 02:55.534
Joe Bueser was one of my opponents. And I believe 
Fish Fudge was the other one. But it was...

03:01.599 --> 03:07.668
Alright, and then when you were elected, did that 
change your status in your outfit? No. You still

03:10.032 --> 03:11.855
had to... I still had to hit a brace. Still had to 
wipe the buzzes off. Still had to do push-ups.

03:17.383 --> 03:19.446
Still had to shine... Senior shoes and junior 
shoes. Do you remember? I didn't have a problem

03:25.093 --> 03:35.342
when we had activities, you know, when we had a 
meeting to plan the freshman ball or to leave. I

03:35.843 --> 03:39.446
just simply had to ask the first sergeant for a 
pass. Who did you work with as a freshman

03:39.466 --> 03:44.411
president? Primarily Dean Penberthy and Mr. 
Hardesty, Pete Hardesty. Forgot Hardesty, yeah.

03:53.238 --> 03:54.820
And what were the big events? Freshman ball. 
Freshman ball. The dance and everything.

03:58.244 --> 03:58.905
Describe it. Well, we had a band, and we had girls 
mostly from TSCW, and that's made up to date, and it

04:00.246 --> 04:13.381
was held over in Savisa. Moved all the tables and 
chairs back, and the band played, and we danced. Do

04:18.447 --> 04:19.808
you remember which band it was? sure don't and this 
was i can look in here this was this is in spring

04:21.442 --> 04:45.222
spring probably april it was the weekend before 
combat ball i can remember that because we were

04:21.442 --> 04:45.222
worried about whether or not it would have any 
impact on the attendance now uh only fish and their

04:21.442 --> 04:45.222
dates came right and then we had faculty advisors 
you did you have a special date you know i can't even

04:46.028 --> 05:11.192
remember having a date okay uh and what where did 
the girls uh that they came how did the how did the

04:46.028 --> 05:11.192
boys get a get connection with the tessies well uh 
most of them had been one or two of them knew a girl

05:11.493 --> 05:40.993
that was going to TSCW and then she would get dates 
for everybody else in the outfit and they would

05:11.493 --> 05:40.993
come down a few of them had cars but most of them came 
on the bus and they would stay with faculty members

05:11.493 --> 05:40.993
here in the community I've been trying to remember 
if we had any motels I remember the Aggieland Inn

05:11.493 --> 05:40.993
but I don't remember whether there were places 
other than homes for people to stay in. And most of

05:45.178 --> 05:48.622
them stayed in homes. And how did everybody behave 
at the dance? It was fairly formal. We were

05:56.272 --> 06:01.839
gentlemen.

06:03.661 --> 06:10.069
You were a little bit intimidated, I can recall 
that, even as a senior.

06:11.686 --> 06:17.495
It's probably about like the claims of drinking at 
Bonfire. I don't remember that. It wasn't

06:20.560 --> 06:21.862
evidenced. Probably it did occur in some 
instances. Could have been made a big story if it

06:25.668 --> 06:35.483
had been written about in today's media.

06:35.648 --> 06:38.072
The young ladies were dressed in formal. Yes, they 
were formally dressed.

06:45.623 --> 06:47.907
The music was slow. And you all didn't worry about 
somebody being intoxicated? Never. I don't ever

06:55.518 --> 07:02.509
remember anybody even smelling like liquor at 
dances here on campus. And there were a lot of blind

07:02.529 --> 07:03.951
dates. uh... probably ninety nine percent did now 
i've heard of beast buckets and moose pots does

07:04.454 --> 07:34.022
that ring a bell the guys would have a pot where you 
put money in and the afters all over who got the

07:04.454 --> 07:34.022
worst date got the money okay yeah pig pots pig pots 
pig pots and i've heard that the girls also had to

07:04.454 --> 07:34.022
say that the boys didn't know that probably didn't 
i wasn't aware of that I've heard from two or three

07:34.188 --> 07:38.031
Tessies that they had the same. But you always put 
those pots together before the girls got here. And

07:42.656 --> 07:49.822
after you lost two or three pots, you quit betting 
on that. The fun all was out of it. What other big

07:52.785 --> 07:56.768
events were there for the freshman president to 
worry about? That was it. That and getting the

08:00.091 --> 08:03.975
organization for the Aggieland. helping with the 
Aggieland staff and getting freshman pictures,

08:04.816 --> 08:22.113
making sure that everybody was in, getting enough 
freshman activities, because the freshmen

08:04.816 --> 08:22.113
participated like in intramurals separately 
from upperclassmen. They had their own

08:22.133 --> 08:34.165
championships in swimming and wrestling and flag 
football, so the freshmen competed intramurally

08:22.133 --> 08:34.165
with other outfits freshmen. So, uh, That was more 
a part of the intramural officer in each unit to get

08:38.414 --> 08:47.484
those, that participation. We worked with the 
Aggieland staff to get pictures of freshman

08:47.524 --> 09:06.885
activities athletically, units marching in, the 
freshman drill team,

08:47.524 --> 09:06.885
simply trying to make that class a part of A&M. Turn 
back and describe Bonfire your freshman year.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.742
What did y'all do and where did you? We were red box. 
We stacked. Triple A had the responsibility of

09:16.665 --> 09:19.289
stacking. Even as a freshman? Yeah. And about how 
long did y'all work on Bonfire? From the SMU game,

09:25.478 --> 09:29.204
so about a month, six weeks. And it always rained. 
And, of course, it was always done by brute force.

09:36.413 --> 09:40.960
And the stack area in those days was behind Duncan? 
Yes. Our first bonfire was in front of the MSC. And

09:46.630 --> 09:48.232
then the rest of them were behind Duncan. Why did 
they move it to Duncan? I can't tell you. I don't

09:53.361 --> 09:57.648
even remember why they moved it over there. I 
always thought it was because of the fire hazard of

10:02.165 --> 10:28.138
embers falling on campus building but you move it 
over there and it falls on the faculty Dr. Little

10:02.165 --> 10:28.138
lived about a block from the stack when they moved 
it to Duncan and he always spent that time when they

10:02.165 --> 10:28.138
lit it with a hose on top of his house spent all night 
watering down the house so that it wouldn't catch a

10:02.165 --> 10:28.138
fire What did a fish red pot do?

10:34.943 --> 10:38.588
We were on the ground with forked sticks. They're 
called fuck sticks. And we physically, by putting

10:41.111 --> 10:50.403
those sticks at an angle, physically put the logs 
up and wired them to the stack. Didn't have any type

10:52.365 --> 10:55.189
of power equipment. I never went to the cut area 
because our responsibility was to stack. And we

11:03.078 --> 11:06.782
physically stacked it. We took those logs and laid 
them up and our bonfire was 79

11:06.802 --> 11:16.794
or 80 foot. Back then, as you probably already 
know, the goal was to make it at least a foot taller

11:17.615 --> 11:25.665
than the year before. So you knew how high you had to 
build it. Do you remember how many stacks it was?

11:32.826 --> 11:33.487
There was one. You just took logs and put them up so 
that they were woven together and when you had hold

11:34.969 --> 11:53.577
you filled in with logs and there's no way that it 
could fall then because it wasn't

11:34.969 --> 11:53.577
separate units. You'd put a tall log up and wire it 
up the top, and then you'd fill in. Now, how did

11:59.183 --> 12:01.966
y'all get the logs way up there? With a pulley. 
Hooked to the... To the center pole. To the center

12:09.994 --> 12:10.975
pole. And they were just simply pullied up. And 
about how many hours a night, a week, did you work?

12:19.504 --> 12:20.425
Usually about eight. eight hours on the stack a 
night yeah how many nights uh about every other

12:20.928 --> 12:46.632
night okay and you're still stacking was done 24 
hours a day yeah because you had to in order to get it

12:20.928 --> 12:46.632
finished

12:20.928 --> 12:46.632
uh and was there any drinking around the stack area 
then uh do you remember i don't remember any

12:20.928 --> 12:46.632
drinking do you remember any injuries of anybody 
anything no the cut area would frequently have

12:48.738 --> 13:13.362
people injured with axes and some of them serious 
but I don't remember any injuries on the stock area

12:48.738 --> 13:13.362
either a sprained hand or twisted an ankle or had a 
log that they didn't let go of quick enough and

12:48.738 --> 13:13.362
pulled a shoulder out of socket but uh now you said 
serious in the cut area serious meaning what uh cut

13:14.455 --> 13:44.074
a leg halfway off or serious uh a flesh wound with an 
axe but they were mostly axe related

13:14.455 --> 13:44.074
and so you did this all four years yes and what did it 
change in your four years at all not really only the

13:14.455 --> 13:44.074
role that you played because uh the all three AAA 
units, that was their responsibility. I don't

13:47.626 --> 13:50.290
know how it became their responsibility. I don't 
know the history on it. All I knew is that we were

13:51.452 --> 13:54.556
responsible for stacking. Freshmen were on the 
ground. Sophomores ran the ground crew. Juniors

14:01.326 --> 14:03.750
and seniors were up on the stack. All right. And 
they were responsible for the whole operation,

14:04.989 --> 14:08.196
stacking operation. Was there a person, an 
individual, who was the chief of all chiefs for

14:08.216 --> 14:14.047
Bonfire? Yeah. Well, no, not for Bonfire, but for 
stacking there was. A junior was selected as

14:19.272 --> 14:29.007
responsible, and I'm sure there was a senior above 
him, but you saw the junior was out there

14:19.272 --> 14:29.007
essentially 24 hours a day. Did he have a nickname? 
What was he? I never heard it. I wasn't it, so I don't

14:34.095 --> 14:36.198
know. So there was not a commander-in-chief 
individual for Bonfire? No. Not that I ever was

14:41.987 --> 14:43.750
aware of. Did civilian students work on Bonfire? 
What are civilians?

14:51.901 --> 14:52.742
No. Well, I don't know because everyone, most 
people were in fatigues, but there were some

14:53.022 --> 15:05.700
people out there in jeans, particularly juniors 
and seniors. Most people were in units. You knew

15:08.203 --> 15:14.592
everybody, and they were from mostly AAA and field 
artillery. were on the stack, but at the tail end

15:15.550 --> 15:23.723
when they had finished cutting, then a lot of 
people showed up to help finish the stack. And you

15:24.725 --> 15:28.491
say it did not change during your four years. Not 
significantly, it just got bigger each year. And

15:33.138 --> 15:37.626
you all did wire everything together with cable? 
No. It was kind of like a barbed wire with no barbed

15:42.753 --> 15:44.795
on it. It was about that thick of wire. Okay, okay. 
And was there a myth about how long after the

15:48.860 --> 15:53.585
bonfire was lit? It had to stay standing until the 
kickoff or we'd lose the game. And most times it did

15:59.752 --> 16:03.556
stay up. And most times under Bear Bryant we won the 
game. Yeah. But the myth was blown, though, in the

16:10.478 --> 16:14.988
60s and 70s. Yes.

16:19.258 --> 16:19.720
Let's see. Back to student government. Okay, you 
were president of the freshman class. Did you

16:25.548 --> 16:27.811
follow that up, sophomore, junior? Student 
senate, yeah. Student senate. I was ag

16:30.916 --> 16:39.147
representative as a sophomore and I was vice chair 
of student senate as a junior and was student

16:30.916 --> 16:39.147
senate president. And how did one become the vice 
chair and the president? How did? Those were

16:43.834 --> 16:47.238
selected by the student senate. You ran 
campus-wide elections. for the representative

16:51.603 --> 16:57.549
from the very school, and then for president of the 
student senate. It was a campus-wide election.

17:00.452 --> 17:00.712
Okay. And do you remember who your opponent was, or 
opponents? Joe Busser. Joe Busser, again. And how

17:08.760 --> 17:11.502
close was the final election? It was close. It was 
very competitive. Were you and Joe friends? Yes.

17:17.508 --> 17:18.710
Competitors and friends. What were the big issues 
before the student senate your senior year? We

17:25.854 --> 17:29.824
started the blood drive, the Aggie blood drive 
that year. Don Rommel chaired Aggie. Community

17:32.626 --> 17:41.495
Relations Committee and started the first Aggie 
Blood Drive. Oh, describe that. Well, we got with

17:44.419 --> 17:46.481
Wadley. Whose idea was it? It was either Don's or 
one of the committee members, but they took that on

17:50.685 --> 17:58.093
as their project for the year. and they organized 
it and worked with Dean Penberthy on getting terms

17:58.985 --> 18:12.923
on

17:58.985 --> 18:12.923
the stipulations on how it would be handled and who 
would have access to the blood, etc. But Don,

18:13.944 --> 18:16.888
you'll have to ask him. Who? I'm not sure. Don 
Rummel. Is he still? He just retired as

18:20.633 --> 18:26.000
entomologist with the experiment station at 
Lubbock. Where does he live? Lubbock. He retired

18:28.415 --> 18:32.600
on April 28th. In fact, I was up just last week, last 
Friday night at his retirement party at the

18:32.680 --> 18:41.589
Lubbock National Bank. And as you all understood 
it, the purpose of this blood drive was to raise

18:42.190 --> 18:48.817
blood for whom? Aggies. What kind of Aggies? 
Students and former students.

18:55.904 --> 19:08.024
And I can't remember the detail, but there had been 
some

18:55.904 --> 19:08.024
situations where people needed blood and were 
unable to get it after either accidents or

18:55.904 --> 19:08.024
surgery. And how well did it go that first year? 
Everybody went. Everybody gave. Do

19:14.255 --> 19:19.223
you remember where? They were here a week. And 
we're down in the basement next, had two or three

19:23.528 --> 19:31.498
rooms down there where the piano usually was. Do 
you remember any poignant examples of where that

19:31.998 --> 19:38.986
blood was used in your experience? No, not really. 
I know two or three times I've asked, is it still

19:41.429 --> 19:46.415
operational the same way? And we've put it in the 
Class of 59 newsletter. All right, typist, you

19:50.917 --> 19:56.067
don't need to add this because this is personal, 
but I just want to share it. This is back in the 70s,

19:57.310 --> 20:03.222
and one of my Garland elementary school buddies. 
Now, I move away from Garland when I'm 10 years old.

20:06.712 --> 20:07.353
He's an Aggie. His name is Jack Leonard. He was a 
dentist. He would have been class of 52. And he and I

20:13.322 --> 20:15.586
were close buddies growing up. His dad was a 
dentist. And I thought they were rich because they

20:17.689 --> 20:21.635
had two cars in the family. And he called me and he 
said, I really need your help. He said, you

20:25.841 --> 20:27.624
remember Gerald Cooper? And I said, of course. 
Gerald's mother and dad And my mother and dad went

20:30.742 --> 20:34.466
to the movies together when the two young wives 
were pregnant. Gerald's born a month ahead of me,

20:35.087 --> 20:38.891
but with awful hemophilia. All his life. And he was 
then, what would have, he'd been 50, I guess, 40,

20:42.054 --> 20:48.120
been 40. And he said that he's in the hospital and 
they're having to give him two or three pints of

20:49.442 --> 20:58.251
blood a day. And we have run out of all the friends 
and the relatives and everything. Is it possible?

21:05.158 --> 21:07.802
He said, I remember the Aggie, is it possible A&M 
could? And I said, well, Gerald went to SMU, didn't

21:08.303 --> 21:10.346
he? He said, yeah, but I was just wondering if 
maybe. I said, well, let me check. I feel a cold

21:15.995 --> 21:18.358
chill as I think about it. So I called the student 
body president and told him the circumstances.

21:23.906 --> 21:28.373
And this is not for an Aggie, but is it possible they 
might share some? He called me back in an hour, and

21:29.686 --> 21:33.369
he said, would 500 pints be enough? Well, you know, 
I have often wondered, and I've never followed up

21:34.510 --> 21:39.535
on it. I haven't used it. I don't know of anyone that 
has used it. But when I have checked with Randy and

21:44.739 --> 21:50.004
them about the procedures, they said it's the 
same. I think so. It's available to any Aggie that

21:50.825 --> 21:53.527
needs it. So that started while? Start of 1959. The 
first Aggie blood test. collection by Wadley was

21:59.740 --> 22:02.884
in the spring of 59. Were you, as the President of 
the Student Senate, were you photographed giving

22:03.525 --> 22:08.612
your blood? No, I don't remember, but Rubble was. 
That committee that put it together were

22:11.696 --> 22:15.541
highlighted. What were some other big issues that 
you remember? Well, The co-ed issue was being

22:25.306 --> 22:30.410
talked about a little bit. Really? Summarize 
that. Well, it was just rumors. And,

22:37.537 --> 22:53.851
of course, all the students, most of the students, 
the ones that talked were absolutely opposed to

22:37.537 --> 22:53.851
women here at A&M. What about those who didn't 
talk? who knows did you have any opinion at that

22:56.947 --> 23:18.887
point I I yes I felt like that it wouldn't be a good 
thing to introduce women and to make A&M

22:56.947 --> 23:18.887
non-military I felt like that there was something 
very unique and different about this place and

22:56.947 --> 23:18.887
felt like that that would ruin it Wasn't very vocal 
about that, but that was honestly my opinion. Did

23:26.083 --> 23:29.067
reporters ever bug you about it, about your 
opinion? No. That was a little bit before it got

23:29.828 --> 23:35.596
actively being discussed. Now, Mr. Rutter came 
here during your- He was vice president, vice

23:36.677 --> 23:41.363
chair. Did you have any meetings with him, any 
conversations with him during that year you were

23:41.384 --> 23:47.592
president? Some contact, but limited. Most of my 
work was with Dean Penberthy. Describe working

23:58.551 --> 24:00.093
with him. He was a gentleman. Dean Penney was good 
counsel. He was a very slow and deliberate in his

24:11.737 --> 24:41.727
discussing issues and topic with people

24:11.737 --> 24:41.727
he gave good support for the student government 
activities

24:11.737 --> 24:41.727
probably Wayne Stark was the one that was 
impressive from Stanford of being so formal and

24:42.331 --> 24:46.976
hard-driving, totally different 
personalities. Make believe I had never seen or

24:47.857 --> 24:50.219
met Wayne Stark. Tell me about him. Very formal, 
always dressed immaculately,

24:52.421 --> 25:00.830
very strictly business. I found him a little bit 
out of place at this place.

25:12.723 --> 25:22.156
A&M had a character about it that was different 
from the few formal places I had been in. And Wayne

25:23.438 --> 25:29.085
was one that you would have expected to be in a very 
formal place. Okay. He was very well spoken. It

25:36.335 --> 25:40.401
didn't take him long to say what he needed to say, 
and then he was gone. When you went in, you knew you

25:41.444 --> 25:49.011
needed to have everything organized that you 
probably wouldn't have over three or four

25:41.444 --> 25:49.011
minutes.

25:51.734 --> 25:54.356
Very effective.

25:56.558 --> 25:58.180
Extremely well organized. And very valuable once 
the students graduated. He guided a lot of people

26:04.266 --> 26:10.692
in making good decisions. Both while they were 
here, but also when they graduated. He helped a lot

26:15.678 --> 26:23.709
of people make some very sound, lifelong 
decisions. Did he ever give you any advice? Not

26:26.714 --> 26:28.256
really. You didn't seek him? I didn't ask him for 
that kind of advice. We got good, sound advice

26:32.742 --> 26:40.273
about who to approach to speak at Sconum. and why, 
and how to approach them, whether you called or

26:41.047 --> 26:54.624
wrote and what you said and how you said it. Those 
are the kinds of guidance that he provided. Do you

27:00.152 --> 27:02.615
remember SCONA that year? What was the topic and 
who were the speakers? No, I never was chair of

27:06.173 --> 27:14.107
SCONA, but I worked on committees and organizing 
and putting it on. Now, Stark occasionally gave a

27:14.387 --> 27:20.699
youngster a real serious lecture if he thought 
they were goofing off too much. Did you ever get one

27:21.400 --> 27:22.963
of those lectures? No, I didn't. In fact, I was not 
aware that that happened. Oh, called Green Couch

27:26.749 --> 27:28.873
Treatment. He had this old green vinyl-covered 
couch. He'd get you in there, close the door, and

27:31.950 --> 27:36.437
say, in effect, he'd say, you ought to be ashamed. 
You can do better, and you know it, and I know it. And

27:38.681 --> 27:42.166
by the time you got through, you felt about that 
high, and he'd say, now get out of here. There were

27:42.988 --> 27:51.702
lots of people down here that could do that very 
well, all the way from sophomores to many of the

27:42.988 --> 27:51.702
faculty. And I don't know if it was age or what, 
but... There was a certain amount of fear and

27:57.203 --> 28:04.233
respect for faculty on this campus. I know I was in 
awe of a lot of faculty members. Such as? Well, Mr.

28:10.601 --> 28:19.433
Reinhart, who taught taxonomy over in 
entomology, as a professor, he had a high

28:10.601 --> 28:19.433
expectation. Don't ever try to play games in his 
class or do things that might be fun. Dr. James, who

28:29.218 --> 28:42.452
was head of the department, was very stiff and 
formal, and you just didn't want to have to do too

28:29.218 --> 28:42.452
much business with him when you were a student. As a 
student body president, did you get to make any

28:43.193 --> 28:47.657
special trips? Oh, yeah. Such as? Well, we went to 
the Cotton Bowl and at the SMU game got to tie Don

28:51.001 --> 29:02.374
Cloud's kiss of the Aggie sweetheart.

29:05.297 --> 29:20.535
We made a number of multi-university

29:05.297 --> 29:20.535
governing conferences.

29:22.017 --> 29:28.744
interacted with the other university's

29:22.017 --> 29:28.744
student government groups. Which ones impressed 
you most? Probably TU, which I hate to admit, but

29:31.948 --> 29:42.359
most of the Southwest Conference student 
leadership were good. You were always impressed

29:43.400 --> 29:51.248
and felt like that you had to really strut in order 
to make an equal impression among them. I always

29:55.034 --> 29:59.803
was amazed at how much a uniform would do, really. 
We'd go to conferences where, like the Texas State

30:00.825 --> 30:15.632
Science Fair, and it was just amazing at the 
difference in just putting on that A&M uniform.

30:17.030 --> 30:23.559
Did you ever go to the legislature representing 
them? Didn't even know we had one. Because see, one

30:26.463 --> 30:39.561
of the things Jack Williams always did would be to 
take the student body president, the highest

30:26.463 --> 30:39.561
ranking woman, and the corps commander, and with a 
straight face he would say these students have

30:26.463 --> 30:39.561
been at random, just happened to run into them 
leaving the campus. No. Like the year that Fred

30:41.920 --> 30:44.544
McClure, you know Fred. Yes, very well. 4-H kid 
from up in Henderson. There you go. And so Senator

30:49.711 --> 30:56.741
Aiken of Paris was chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee during this era. In old East Texas.

30:57.802 --> 30:58.323
That's right. So Jack Williams introduced Fred 
and he said, And so Mr. Aiken said, Fred, tell these

31:01.968 --> 31:05.814
people where you're from. Oh, I'm from St. 
Augustine, where... He said, no, Fred, tell them

31:08.137 --> 31:10.601
where you were born and grew up. Oh, that's right, 
sir. I was born in Paris, your hometown. Grew up

31:14.788 --> 31:17.452
there, and then we moved when I was a ninth grader. 
In fact, this suit I'm wearing was...
