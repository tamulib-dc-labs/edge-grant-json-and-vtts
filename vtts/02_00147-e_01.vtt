WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:07.832
and any potential involvement by outsiders?

00:10.056 --> 00:23.423
Well, as I had just mentioned, the thing I guess I'm proudest of is that no one that I have known or any system

00:23.403 --> 00:38.057
None has been set up to get anyone into veterinary college unless they ranked in the top of the computerized selection system.

00:38.417 --> 00:42.581
No political pressure, as far as I know, has ever gotten anyone into the college.

00:43.302 --> 00:50.068
Let me enter as an editorial note a memory of being in President Jack Williams' office one day.

00:50.960 --> 01:08.500
He got a call from a very well-known, wealthy oil man, former student, who apparently had promised his secretary that he would get her nephew admitted to the NM vet program.

01:10.182 --> 01:18.452
Dr. Williams very tactfully tried to tell him that there was a search process, that he as president would not get involved,

01:19.428 --> 01:44.305
I could tell that the former student's temperament was getting more and more alarmed and angry, and very soon he was cussing Dr. Williams and ended up by telling him, you son of a bitch, I'm going to get you fired because I made a commitment and you're supposed to do what I tell you to do.

01:45.719 --> 01:53.147
Dr. Williams at first was chuckling over the interview and then became very serious.

01:53.588 --> 02:10.426
When he hung up, he turned to me and seriously asked, what if there were ten slots in each first year class for veterinary medicine which were selected by the president?

02:10.446 --> 02:12.368
What was my opinion of that idea?

02:13.090 --> 02:25.815
Off the top of my head, I said, Dr. Williams, once that becomes known, and it would become known, 10 times 10 times 10 slots would not be enough.

02:27.399 --> 02:33.090
He quickly agreed with that opinion.

02:33.728 --> 02:50.333
went out of his way to indicate that as far as he was aware, the admissions process at the NM College of Veterinary Medicine had always been far above politics, money, or anything else.

02:50.353 --> 02:51.214
In hindsight,

02:52.122 --> 03:01.181
In hindsight, can you think of any modifications that should have been made in the admissions process?

03:02.504 --> 03:10.080
Well, fortunately one of my colleagues in the department spent

03:10.060 --> 03:25.082
25 years in the selection process and trying to improve on it and trying to find better ways to select students.

03:25.062 --> 03:33.453
And these people that are on the selection committee, it really just takes everything out of them.

03:33.473 --> 03:43.527
They get so involved with the kids and the selection and all that, and it's really a hard task.

03:43.507 --> 03:57.732
But he began the computerization of data and looking at selection and chances for graduation versus the criteria selected on, et cetera.

03:58.514 --> 04:00.317
He found one outstanding

04:02.002 --> 04:18.475
criterion that seemed to be the best predictor of finishing veterinary college, and that was if you finished in the top 10 percent of your high school class.

04:18.455 --> 04:23.522
you had a very good chance of finishing veterinary medicine.

04:23.642 --> 04:27.767
Better predictor than grade point average or anything else.

04:27.787 --> 04:39.923
And regardless of the size of the high school or the number of graduates in the class or anything else, and what he finally decided was that

04:39.903 --> 04:47.470
A person that finishes in the top ten percent of his high school class is a very conscientious person.

04:48.131 --> 04:50.393
He does all of his homework assignments.

04:50.473 --> 04:53.176
He makes all of his deadlines.

04:53.276 --> 04:56.820
He wants to excel.

04:56.860 --> 05:04.848
And so he found that to be the most important thing to consider.

05:07.430 --> 05:08.391
Describe

05:09.535 --> 05:19.726
describe the relationship between the College of Veterinary Medicine and the A&M Medical Program.

05:22.389 --> 05:31.058
Well, the A&M Medical Program is still a very young college, of course.

05:33.281 --> 05:39.087
The main relationship was probably in the

05:39.505 --> 05:45.592
the establishment of the College of Medicine.

05:45.652 --> 06:01.729
The veterinary colleges and certain individuals within the college were most involved in developing a relationship with Baylor College of Medicine, which was important.

06:03.131 --> 06:07.656
Since the Baylor supported the

06:07.822 --> 06:17.651
founding of a college at A&M and was to serve as the clinical arm of a two-year college of medicine at A&M.

06:18.511 --> 06:31.503
And so most of the relationship with the veterinary college was early on in helping to bring the medical college here.

06:31.543 --> 06:37.828
And since then, over time, there have been some joint

06:37.808 --> 06:44.402
joint appointments, faculty appointments, joint research efforts.

06:45.224 --> 06:57.471
I know I used to take most of the graduate students in the medical school, receive their degree through my department.

06:57.451 --> 07:06.303
because the medical school was not large enough and did not have a graduate degree program.

07:06.323 --> 07:13.814
And so we used to cooperate on graduate degrees, joint hiring of faculty.

07:13.834 --> 07:25.230
One spouse might be a veterinarian, one spouse a physician, and we would jointly hire those people between the two colleges.

07:25.210 --> 07:37.954
I think as time goes on and the College of Medicine matures and begins to develop greater research and

07:38.575 --> 07:45.287
activities that the two will be much more involved.

07:46.149 --> 07:56.027
Has the creation of the medical program helped the library resources available to veterinary medicine?

07:56.007 --> 07:57.068
Well, yes.

07:58.470 --> 08:15.552
I would think that the New Medical Sciences Library, not new but relatively new, which has a large volume of collections and journals especially,

08:15.532 --> 08:27.707
And it was a result of a joint request by the veterinary school and the medical school for funding to get a separate library.

08:27.767 --> 08:30.009
And it's a good library.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.052
It's connected.

08:32.973 --> 08:43.606
The library is connected by an underground system so that both colleges can have free access to it.

08:43.626 --> 08:45.488
As you look back over

08:46.514 --> 08:47.296
How many years?

08:49.119 --> 08:53.467
What year did you first enter veterinary medicine classes?

08:53.487 --> 08:56.453
I first entered Texas A&M in 1948.

08:56.694 --> 08:57.235
Right.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.481
So more than a half century.

09:02.805 --> 09:08.877
Compare the program in veterinary medicine then and now.

09:13.058 --> 09:18.124
I was fortunate to enter the veterinary school in 1954.

09:20.507 --> 09:26.994
At that time, Dr. Armstead was dean.

09:28.296 --> 09:36.265
He made some very drastic changes in the professionalism of the student body.

09:36.498 --> 10:04.547
With his coming in, he saw that all the students were clothed in white and very clean, that they were active in various student affairs, and he really made the veterinary student a professional student.

10:04.527 --> 10:32.138
And then as the college progressed in its educational programs, with more students and more faculty, began to develop a significant research program and has had many firsts in the country as far as veterinary medicine.

10:33.586 --> 10:35.950
Howdy, how are you doing?

10:35.970 --> 10:39.937
Have you met Dr. Monroe before?

10:43.703 --> 10:46.287
We were comparing then and now.

10:46.468 --> 10:49.713
Veterinary classes when you were admitted were how many?

10:49.733 --> 10:50.855
64.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.057
64.

10:52.578 --> 10:58.648
And the veterinary program was over in the building near the system.

11:00.552 --> 11:07.322
Well, they were over on the main campus at that time.

11:07.422 --> 11:10.867
We had to move off campus because of the animals.

11:12.009 --> 11:24.568
And we had three or four buildings over there that eventually were turned over to engineering and other... And the faculty was about how many when you were...

11:24.548 --> 11:35.148
Oh, probably our faculty didn't have, the whole college probably didn't have 30 faculty or so back in that day.

11:35.168 --> 11:38.815
And as far as you know, what might have been the total research budget?

11:40.138 --> 11:44.987
Oh, I would imagine $5,000 maybe.

11:47.212 --> 11:55.922
And the animals, some of them were housed on the main campus and others were west of the tracks?

11:56.763 --> 11:59.927
Well, nearly all of our animals were on main campus.

12:01.669 --> 12:08.477
Up there where we have the bonfire now and everything, that was our veterinary pastures up there.

12:08.660 --> 12:16.152
And most of the research in that era was being done on what species of animals?

12:16.633 --> 12:34.583
The main research was what Dr. Francis had been involved in, and that was tick fever, Texas cattle fever, and anaplasma, and pyroplasmosis, and some toxic plant research.

12:35.187 --> 12:43.330
Was it even standard terminology then to refer to small animal or large animal veterinary practice?

12:45.216 --> 12:46.800
Well, it was...

12:49.582 --> 12:51.184
Yeah, I guess it was.

12:51.624 --> 13:01.176
That's evolved over time from equine, primary equine, into small animal and pets.

13:01.196 --> 13:07.143
And now they pretty well have broken it down into food animal medicine.

13:08.164 --> 13:13.530
All those things are edible and they don't consider horses in this country edible.

13:13.510 --> 13:20.597
Most are owned by Texas has a million horses, and 90% of them belong to ladies.

13:21.979 --> 13:28.786
And so they're referred to as companion animals, along with dogs, cats, and so forth.

13:28.806 --> 13:32.570
All right, now we're getting close to the end.

13:32.990 --> 13:41.239
As you look back over all these years, what are Texas A&M Veterinary Medicine's greatest pluses,

13:42.063 --> 13:49.734
And if there are any minuses, what do the veterinary program do best and least well?

13:51.977 --> 14:01.051
Well, I think it's always had a very solid foundation for educating future veterinarians.

14:01.071 --> 14:05.477
And I think that still has to be its primary mission.

14:06.959 --> 14:10.264
After all, molecular research

14:10.244 --> 14:18.436
the evolving of that has made the cell look the same for humans and animals.

14:18.636 --> 14:28.070
And so if we can educate the students, we're probably the, I mean, that's our mission.

14:28.210 --> 14:33.197
Nobody else can educate students to be veterinarians except the Veterinary College.

14:33.903 --> 15:03.910
However, the research can be cut across all disciplines, and yet veterinary research, the capability of maintaining animals and caring for animals, and as I was just visiting with Dr. Fossum, developing the anesthetic protocol

15:03.890 --> 15:30.589
the pharmaceuticals for animals and helping other disciplines probably is something that's unique to the veterinarian and right now veterinarians are highly involved in all animal research in medicine, biology departments and everywhere else because of the fact that all

15:30.569 --> 15:35.236
laboratory animals have to be supervised and given veterinary care.

15:36.278 --> 15:44.470
But our basic mission here of education is still primary even in the turn of the century.

15:45.251 --> 15:49.978
Our research program, however, has grown tremendously and

15:49.958 --> 16:14.310
is recognized worldwide for its work in toxicology and the development of the animal or bovine genome and all of the new orthopedic activities and equine and many, many things.

16:14.350 --> 16:16.313
Then we collaborate with lots of people.

16:16.353 --> 16:19.257
Dr. Fossman was just visiting with us.

16:19.237 --> 16:32.878
heads up the DeBakey Institute here where they're developing new heart assist devices and studies in cardiovascular research.

16:34.020 --> 16:46.459
As you look at it, are there some new areas of research to which Texas A&M ought to give more emphasis than it is now?

16:47.131 --> 16:49.598
Well, that's seeing far into the future.

16:49.658 --> 17:02.372
I've seen research come from, as I mentioned before, when we were taking cellular biology or histology, cellular anatomy,

17:03.044 --> 17:10.314
At the time all the thing recognized in the cell was the nucleus and nucleolus and cytoplasma and the cell wall.

17:10.334 --> 17:32.325
And at the present at the molecular level all the DNA and the interrelationships of the ribosomes and everything else in the cell and the cloning and the splitting and the changing of the genetic material in the cells and now stem cell research and

17:32.305 --> 17:51.322
just the evolution to that level, and the closer you get to the cellular level in the stem cell, the closer you get to the fact that both animal and human are made up of the same DNA.

17:52.063 --> 18:02.312
So I think the point in time will come when organs will be completely transferable from animals to man.

18:02.292 --> 18:19.472
and be able to replace all the organs with animal organs, be able to use stem cells to change the genetic makeup of individuals that might have some genetic disease.

18:20.092 --> 18:28.722
And these things look a little futuristic, but the way that science is changing now each day,

18:28.702 --> 18:38.934
perhaps within the next 10 years all these things will be that we think are way in the future will be in place.

18:39.595 --> 18:51.368
And it's already predicted the life expectancy of man to exceed 125 years by the mid-century.

18:52.175 --> 19:03.315
During all these years that you've been a professional here, what did you and your family do for fun, for relaxation?

19:05.607 --> 19:22.924
Initially, the fact that I was in school for about 30 years and with a family, I had a first child when I entered veterinary school and I went through veterinary school and went.

19:23.393 --> 19:32.687
Through PhD programs and all those, we had and then practiced and then worked on top of all of that, too.

19:34.790 --> 19:36.253
We didn't have lots of time.

19:36.313 --> 19:50.194
We didn't have the money or the resources to have much recreation, except I spent about

19:50.174 --> 19:57.203
10 or 15 years coaching the Little League and teenage baseball and things like that.

19:57.223 --> 20:00.687
We liked to fish and hunt.

20:01.027 --> 20:03.571
Where did you normally fish and hunt?

20:04.852 --> 20:10.179
Well, primarily hunted all over the state of Texas.

20:11.620 --> 20:11.941
Deer?

20:12.361 --> 20:13.823
No, just quail.

20:13.863 --> 20:17.768
And then fishing where?

20:18.271 --> 20:22.983
Oh, primarily local fishing.

20:23.384 --> 20:24.005
Any hobbies?

20:24.066 --> 20:25.048
Do you collect anything?

20:25.830 --> 20:26.311
No.

20:26.812 --> 20:29.479
I don't do anything but fishing, hunting, and my

20:30.927 --> 20:38.819
My kids, we tried to stay active in church and them active in church.

20:39.399 --> 20:42.344
Which church?

20:42.364 --> 20:43.926
A&M Church of Christ.

20:44.186 --> 20:48.292
We built a new building while we were in all of this time.

20:49.454 --> 21:00.310
My kids were all active in school, so there wasn't a great deal of outside things to do here.

21:01.235 --> 21:06.002
Okay, we're near the end now, and so you're the consultant.

21:08.866 --> 21:16.136
First of all, we have hired you as the consultant to advise the department that you've served for so long.

21:18.259 --> 21:19.941
Give them advice about the future.

21:20.121 --> 21:26.550
What should they do?

21:29.483 --> 21:43.706
As a department head, your main task is recruiting the best faculty and then providing them a place to work.

21:44.447 --> 21:49.635
And I think the thing that used to be

21:49.615 --> 21:57.653
What caused me more anxiety than anything else was losing faculty from time to time.

21:57.673 --> 22:04.688
I finally got a philosophy that if I lost a faculty member, I was going to hire a better one.

22:04.668 --> 22:16.913
And so I tried to take the attitude that the loss of faculty was a good thing, because I was going to get a better replacement.

22:16.933 --> 22:25.410
But I think the main thing about the department is having good people, and I don't mean just capable scientists,

22:26.217 --> 22:33.607
that are morally strong and family oriented and are loyal to the institution.

22:33.948 --> 22:39.155
I think these are all very important things and can work with other people.

22:40.917 --> 22:46.365
Okay, now you're advising the college's leadership.

22:46.445 --> 22:55.077
What advice would you give the dean, the president, the chancellor, the board of regents and so forth about veterinary medicine?

22:56.980 --> 23:04.071
I think to recognize that the students that are recruited into the program are the

23:05.047 --> 23:24.890
cream of the crop for the state of Texas, and they are the most important thing that goes on in the college, and they should be providing the resources to get excellent education.

23:25.891 --> 23:28.995
I think the people that are

23:29.482 --> 23:44.204
and the faculty and people that are doing research and the graduate students need an opportunity facility-wise to have a place to work, and I have thoughts as to how that can be done.

23:45.466 --> 23:50.494
But I think the faculty member

23:50.474 --> 24:08.719
predominately in the research field should be responsible for procurement of outside funding to take care of his basic research and should add to the

24:09.442 --> 24:23.587
faculty, they should be an integrated part of the faculty and shouldn't feel that they are just superior because they have large research grants.

24:24.829 --> 24:28.075
And recently we've been able to get a chair for

24:28.561 --> 24:43.944
someone in teaching, educational chair, try to make teachers as important to the administration as the researcher.

24:45.126 --> 24:48.471
Are the facilities comparatively adequate?

24:48.992 --> 24:51.716
Do there need to be additional facilities?

24:51.736 --> 24:55.682
Well, I sent a proposal to the

24:57.282 --> 25:00.829
Vice President and Vice Chancellor for Research last week.

25:02.632 --> 25:11.902
They were talking about needing facilities for the private sector and also for research.

25:12.062 --> 25:29.601
And I sent him a proposal, which I had made 15, 20 years ago and got approved, but nothing was ever done, to build research buildings out on the research farm.

25:30.374 --> 25:38.286
or research annex or park, using service bonds.

25:39.488 --> 25:42.733
In other words, you don't have to use university money.

25:42.773 --> 25:59.318
If you build a general purpose research facility, then let the, as a researcher gets large grants and expands his program, he'll also be able to get money for leasing additional space.

26:00.833 --> 26:20.395
And then if a certain private sector individual comes along that's got a good program and needs space, they would always keep these buildings projected ahead so that you've always got some vacant space coming up.

26:21.404 --> 26:30.201
And this can all be done on service bondage like you do at the dormitory or a parking garage or anything else.

26:30.442 --> 26:35.532
You don't have to use university resources to do it.

26:36.153 --> 26:38.899
How large should the admission classes be?

26:39.099 --> 26:42.045
Should they remain about the same or more or less?

26:42.785 --> 26:47.953
Well, I think they remained at 50 or 60 for many years.

26:48.013 --> 26:56.926
They've been at 130 for a number of years.

26:59.430 --> 27:01.553
Some practitioners are

27:02.073 --> 27:06.963
having to go to Oklahoma and Louisiana and places to find students.

27:06.983 --> 27:14.018
So evidently we have a, we're at a near balance in the state, I think.

27:15.181 --> 27:16.183
You'd have to

27:16.484 --> 27:20.908
look at the projections for the state population increase.

27:21.028 --> 27:24.571
I guess Texas is running 19 million now or so.

27:24.611 --> 27:35.361
And they have pretty well some ideas how many veterinarians you should have per capita or numbers of people.

27:35.381 --> 27:42.407
It used to be a veterinarian per 10,000 or something like that, but I haven't kept up with it.

27:42.467 --> 27:46.491
But I think you just have to look at the population growth.

27:46.471 --> 27:54.573
and the animal population growth and types of animals and these kinds of things.

27:55.556 --> 28:00.750
Surely people that are in administration now are looking at things like that.

28:01.861 --> 28:02.202
All right.

28:02.743 --> 28:04.428
Have we left anything out?

28:05.350 --> 28:06.433
I don't think so.

28:08.197 --> 28:17.642
Then the last question I can think of is how do you feel about the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&M?

28:20.238 --> 28:37.234
Well, to speak to, I guess, Texas A&M itself first, it's pretty well directed my entire life and career by just coming to Texas A&M in 1948.

28:37.214 --> 28:53.954
It's been the foundation all the way through for what I've done as a student, as an employee, and as a profession, and a little of everything.

28:54.034 --> 28:58.159
And so I've felt real good about it.

28:58.713 --> 29:00.857
receiving an education here.

29:00.877 --> 29:10.012
I know everybody is proud of where they go to school and where they graduate from.

29:10.032 --> 29:16.283
Having been involved

29:16.263 --> 29:24.420
academics throughout the United States and somewhat throughout a great part of the world.

29:24.440 --> 29:36.465
I always find that A&M is in a good leadership position and well recognized.

29:36.445 --> 30:02.740
You have to realize that the fact that we're a public university, receive state funding, have lots of federal funding and research, and then have a rather large endowment, we are a very unique university and have more resources than nearly universities than nearly any other state and, of course, in lots of other countries.

30:04.981 --> 30:07.195
So it's a good place to be and have them.
