WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:14.955
Your full name, and what about where you were born, 
and when, and how many years, and how you finally

00:01.533 --> 00:14.955
got to Texas A&M. Noel Parsons, my middle initials 
are. Which you never use? Yeah, I do. I use it, but I

00:21.907 --> 00:26.815
don't spell it out.

00:27.470 --> 00:41.136
I was born and raised in Oklahoma, went to the 
University of Oklahoma, and got a commission in

00:27.470 --> 00:41.136
the Air Force through ROTC there. Graduated in 64, 
went right into the Air Force for four years, and

00:41.236 --> 00:50.794
realized I didn't want to make the Air Force my 
career. You were a pilot, weren't you? No, I was on

00:54.128 --> 01:01.678
flying status, but I was an intelligence officer, 
and there was a power to navigate. I did some

01:02.705 --> 01:15.005
couriers

01:02.705 --> 01:15.005
for this

01:02.705 --> 01:15.005
too. I used to fly into Berlin from Frankfurt to 
visit our side in Berlin.

01:28.287 --> 01:30.931
asked me to carry the mail. Oh, it was the line that 
you gave in the mail to people? Did you know that was

01:38.543 --> 01:40.866
going on? Oh, yeah. So where were you stationed 
most of the time? I was three years in Frankfurt, on

01:45.173 --> 01:52.604
my air base, and met my wife while I was over there. 
Oh, did you? She was an American student. From

01:55.548 --> 01:55.909
where? She was from Houston. What school did she go 
to? Oh, she was going to a German art school. Oh, she

02:02.763 --> 02:08.089
was going to a German art school, okay. Okay, she 
wasn't going to, you know...

02:08.109 --> 02:25.188
No, no, she was going

02:08.109 --> 02:25.188
to the technical art school in Oakland on our

02:08.109 --> 02:25.188
side of the community. And she was working in 
Frankfurt, too. We met at the Poshy Ball in the East

02:25.989 --> 02:26.830
Ball. But at any rate, I decided I didn't want to 
make the Air Force a career, so I decided to go back

02:27.991 --> 02:48.853
to school, use my GI benefits, and went back to the 
University of Oklahoma and started the master's

02:27.991 --> 02:48.853
program in journalism. And I didn't like 
newspapers very much, and I was talking to my

02:54.485 --> 03:17.086
advisor

02:54.485 --> 03:17.086
one day and told him I really don't know what I want 
to do with the journalism degree. He said, why

03:17.106 --> 03:18.047
don't you go into book publishing? I said, hey, 
about that, I've been interested in books. He

03:19.188 --> 03:20.029
said, yeah, but how do you get into it? He told me 
about the fellowship program at the University of

03:20.049 --> 03:21.570
Oklahoma Press. So I tried out all of that and got my 
way. I've been in the publishing business ever

03:22.451 --> 03:23.412
since. We

03:26.193 --> 03:47.717
had an internship

03:26.193 --> 03:47.717
at the journalism school, but it's not the same 
sort of program. This was a fellowship, it was

03:47.737 --> 03:50.260
paid, and we got experience in several different 
areas. We concentrated in conference. And there

03:50.901 --> 03:51.562
were two of us in here. And that program had been 
initiated by Savoy Lockerville. Way

03:53.395 --> 04:14.703
back

03:53.395 --> 04:14.703
in

03:53.395 --> 04:14.703
the early 50s, Jack Kyle, who was director of UT 
Press, was one of the graduates of the program.

04:14.723 --> 04:15.804
Director of the University of Washington Press. 
He retired recently and was a graduate. Who was the

04:16.625 --> 04:17.426
director of Alchemist Press? Ed Shaw. Savoy, 
Lawtonville,

04:20.277 --> 04:39.082
just retired a year

04:20.277 --> 04:39.082
or two years ago.

04:39.102 --> 04:40.324
So that's S-A-V-O-Y? S-A-V-O-Y. 
I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N-V-I-N

04:41.466 --> 04:46.993
He died recently. Retired in

04:48.627 --> 05:00.527
60, I guess it was 67. That's a good year for a 
homeowner. Yes. Well, Lawtonville was a big

05:02.952 --> 05:06.097
director and a good publisher. They built their 
American Indian series, and a lot of the Western

05:06.117 --> 05:09.543
exploration books that they did. They built 
Altamont. So you were there for about a year? I was

05:14.483 --> 05:23.541
there a year, in that program, and then I got a job in 
Detroit, in the

05:14.483 --> 05:23.541
Dearborn, actually. Professional 
organization, society for manufacturing

05:23.561 --> 05:30.415
engineers. I worked there two and a half years, and 
they closed their program. for the Society of

05:34.561 --> 05:41.270
Manufacturing Engineers? There's a chapter 
here. And you're doing the editing? The

05:45.235 --> 05:47.478
professional association, you're doing the 
editing? Right. We had a books department.

05:54.007 --> 06:03.640
We published books on manufacturing 
engineering, and product engineering, and we

05:54.007 --> 06:03.640
edited the Manufacturing Engineers Handbook, 
which was published in October of last year. It

06:04.261 --> 06:20.135
was an interesting experience because there were 
three of us and we did a little bit of everything.

06:20.155 --> 06:21.578
And then they decided though to close down the book 
publishing on Rich. They gave us a month's notice.

06:28.124 --> 06:32.310
Actually, December the 2nd, they let us know that 
as of the end of the year we were out of there. Oh, no,

06:32.690 --> 06:33.612
no. Well, that's a typical Detroit moment. And 
they gave us a month's notice and said it was on the

06:39.360 --> 06:43.727
way. So I started looking immediately for the 
person in question. And how did you get into it?

06:49.808 --> 06:50.129
Why? Why? Because I wanted to get back into it. I 
really liked scholarly publishing as opposed to

06:53.232 --> 07:03.184
trade publishing, all the kind of professional 
publishing. And I didn't want to go to New York. I

07:07.289 --> 07:10.052
didn't really want to live in New York. I

07:10.072 --> 07:14.938
was a small town boy. I just didn't feel 
comfortable doing something like that. I

07:17.870 --> 07:33.955
put out my resume to everybody in the university 
press directory. The only good nipple I got was

07:33.976 --> 07:36.199
from Dick Winworth at the University of Illinois, 
but he was associate director. You just have to

07:37.597 --> 07:40.501
know him real well. He's a nice guy. I saw him just 
the other day in San Francisco. He must be getting

07:47.810 --> 07:50.073
ready to retire. Who's he with now, you know? Oh, 
he's director of Bill and Marla.

08:01.127 --> 08:02.969
Student director of Bill and Marla. He became 
director on Sunday before Sunday. But, uh, he, I

08:03.890 --> 08:04.431
went, uh, I

08:06.082 --> 08:32.434
went to Champaign and interviewed with him and 
then they hired me and I started work there in

08:06.082 --> 08:32.434
Marshall since 73. And then the summer of 75 I went 
to an AAUP meeting in Brown County, Indiana. who

08:35.191 --> 08:40.077
met with Dick, who's now finally camped out at 
State Park. He went to the meeting out of his

08:40.097 --> 08:42.961
trailer. Is that right? Yeah. And Mary Stith, who 
was the managing editor, editor-in-chief at

08:46.266 --> 09:03.949
Midwest and both former press, who had managed the 
fellowship program, who told me that Frank

08:46.266 --> 09:03.949
Wardlaw, who I'd always heard of, the great 
legendary Frank Wardlaw, was starting a new

08:46.266 --> 09:03.949
press, the Texas A&M. And

09:04.300 --> 09:26.676
he was looking for an associate editor. And so she 
recommended that I talk to him. And she introduced

09:27.558 --> 09:28.138
me to him. And he said, well, come on up to my room in 
such and such a time. We'll have a drink and we'll

09:29.481 --> 09:30.162
talk. And so I went to his room and he gave me scotch, 
which I was drinking at the time, and a great big

09:32.870 --> 09:41.101
cigar. I didn't know how to turn down the cigars.

09:45.828 --> 09:52.377
So I sat there and puffed on that cigar, and we 
talked for a good while. And he told me what he was

09:52.597 --> 09:59.907
doing at 8 AM, and that he was trying to collect a

10:00.562 --> 10:23.620
group of people that would staff a small but active 
press. But he wanted to start the press out full

10:23.640 --> 10:24.602
grown. And we would begin publishing about 15 or 16 
books a year and continue it that way. He wanted

10:26.305 --> 10:27.126
people who were experienced and who

10:27.511 --> 10:48.387
invited

10:27.511 --> 10:48.387
me to come take a look at College Station. So that 
was in June. The next month then Chris and I loaded

10:48.828 --> 10:52.033
Claire into the car and we drove to Houston to see 
her appearance and on the way we stopped at College

10:48.828 --> 10:52.033
Station. We stayed in the Aggie suite, the guest 
quarters in the house, and Frank and Rosemary

10:53.127 --> 11:02.479
showed us all around. And we drove down to Illinois 
in an air-conditioned car. And I dropped out of

11:08.547 --> 11:10.510
Texas in July. Oh, yeah. And poor little Claire was 
two years old. Well, she was three years old. In

11:18.440 --> 11:21.244
case I use the name wrong. Chris is C-H-K-R-I-R. 
C-L-A-R. Okay, so

11:25.073 --> 11:34.507
you come into town and you stay at the press 
quarters. Yeah, we went right to Frank

11:34.607 --> 11:43.440
Roseberry's house, the old press

11:34.607 --> 11:43.440
building. And they showed us around the town.

11:51.110 --> 12:15.008
At the same time, in June, at the meeting, Ed Shaw 
had told me that

11:51.110 --> 12:15.008
he

11:51.110 --> 12:15.008
was looking for a competitor to replace Mary Stitt 
for his retirement. A&M,

12:15.460 --> 12:41.282
I talked to Frank and told him that I had a law firm in 
New York and Frank said, well, you know, we can, the

12:15.460 --> 12:41.282
pay was about the same here on jobs, but Frank said 
that he would see what he could do about getting

12:15.460 --> 12:41.282
money to help with my living expenses. Ed had told 
me that he couldn't, he didn't have the money to

12:41.937 --> 12:46.843
help us pay Frank Miller. He was having to work the 
slave wages in Illinois for two and a half years. We

12:52.230 --> 12:54.253
didn't have any money, so. Yeah, I know. We were, we 
were his church guys at the time, and I just really

12:55.334 --> 13:01.683
couldn't afford a move. And, uh, so Frank then, uh, 
When I

13:04.938 --> 13:29.264
came

13:04.938 --> 13:29.264
to College Station in July, Frank told

13:04.938 --> 13:29.264
me that he had to take me to Vegas. And I found out 
later that he had gone to the Association of Former

13:29.284 --> 13:30.825
Students. They had provided him. And so I told him 
that I would take the job that we would need was to

13:31.306 --> 13:33.308
start September 1st. And

13:34.452 --> 13:57.172
so then we went on to Houston and visited Liz's 
grandparents and her sister who was living there

13:34.452 --> 13:57.172
at the time. Her parents were still living in 
Europe. And then we came back through Ballin

13:58.013 --> 13:59.616
Station on our way back from the homeowner. He 
stayed

14:02.161 --> 14:19.021
with Frank and Rose Maria Kinn for a couple of days, 
and we went to try to find a department. And it was a

14:19.041 --> 14:20.284
bad time of the year to try to find a department. 
Late July. Yeah. Oh,

14:21.601 --> 14:41.935
and also during that visit, Frank took me over to 
meet Jack Lutz. It was quite impressive. He took me

14:42.456 --> 14:45.361
to the President, even though he wasn't in the 
President, actually had the time to visit him and

14:42.456 --> 14:45.361
visit with a young editor. Really, you know, that 
was just being hired as a copywriter. So that was

14:47.264 --> 14:47.845
quite impressive. Yeah,

14:48.652 --> 15:09.488
a lot of people

14:48.652 --> 15:09.488
have mentioned,

14:48.652 --> 15:09.488
I was wondering

14:48.652 --> 15:09.488
how Wayne was getting the whole perspective of it, 
but Wayne was very positive about the film. He was

15:09.508 --> 15:12.313
very interested in the film, and he was interested 
in the people that Frank was talking about,

15:09.508 --> 15:12.313
because he asked me about the stories. I told him I 
was going to the University of Illinois. Of

15:23.983 --> 15:30.672
course, my hair was not color-linked and I had a 
handlebar mustache. And so he thought of the fact

15:30.692 --> 15:38.942
that Aggies were very clean-cut and didn't use 
marijuana or any other drugs, that we were trying

15:30.692 --> 15:38.942
to keep the campus straight. And just by 
implication, get your haircuts up. Good thing you

15:45.103 --> 15:49.471
didn't interview with butter, eh? Yeah,

15:49.511 --> 15:54.178
that's right. Taking you to the body shop. So I 
began to get the idea that this was quite a bit of

15:56.041 --> 16:05.236
work in Illinois. But we liked it.

16:11.086 --> 16:14.672
It was vibrant and active. There was so much going 
on. Even in the middle of the summer, it was a good

16:21.104 --> 16:25.272
place. It was really moving. You had not really 
been here before. You've been in Houston for a few

16:28.137 --> 16:31.162
years. I'd never been to College Station before. 
I'd been all around with Houston and Austin. And

16:34.981 --> 17:00.075
there was a college friend of mine who lived in 
Houston, and he used to go to Galveston and Houston

16:34.981 --> 17:00.075
for summer break, but he never stopped at the bus 
station. How about the... Did

17:01.255 --> 17:19.516
you know any

17:01.255 --> 17:19.516
of the people who were involved

17:01.255 --> 17:19.516
in that? No, I didn't. I did write all of that

17:19.816 --> 17:23.521
documentation. And, uh, there's a, a debt market 
that came to visit that first night we came in July.

17:28.711 --> 17:46.628
Frank

17:28.711 --> 17:46.628
Hedlund hit Margaret and later Myra Hinton. I 
can't remember if Diane was there, but I doubt it.

17:47.711 --> 17:48.913
So it was, I think it was just Margaret and Ray that 
hit us. No, Buck was not there at that time. I didn't

17:57.293 --> 18:05.562
meet him until after

17:57.293 --> 18:05.562
I started working. Guy asked me earlier, what do 
you remember as one of your happiest times or

18:05.582 --> 18:18.175
conditions or something while you were there? 
Okay,

18:19.066 --> 18:41.630
so when you come back through, how was that? You 
visited a couple more days. Finally found an

18:42.291 --> 18:42.831
apartment. Finally found an apartment and a place 
to lay toast. We decided to come in mid-August,

18:43.912 --> 18:45.534
made our deposit, and we went down to the city. Then 
we went back to Willamette, New York, and then we

18:45.554 --> 18:47.436
closed it down right there in New York. At the same 
time,

18:48.361 --> 19:00.924
I called Ed Shaw and told him he was coming here. I 
sometimes

19:00.944 --> 19:05.612
regretted that. I didn't feel it was a great 
opportunity to learn from one of the top people in

19:05.632 --> 19:09.880
the business. I

19:11.885 --> 19:40.677
think

19:11.885 --> 19:40.677
it's

19:11.885 --> 19:40.677
good I came

19:11.885 --> 19:40.677
to Texas, but, you know, I think we have an idea. But

19:40.943 --> 20:06.575
when we came back from Houston to stop and find an 
apartment, when we got back, Frank had talked to, I

19:40.943 --> 20:06.575
remember very distinctly, that he was feeling a 
little poorly, but he was trying to help us in his

19:40.943 --> 20:06.575
most important way. And we were standing in the 
hallway of their apartment, and I was talking to

20:06.595 --> 20:09.178
him, and all of a sudden he turned white as a sheet. 
and

20:09.462 --> 20:18.459
just fell over the mountain just like a tree. He 
just fainted dead away. I tried to catch him, but he

20:19.921 --> 20:22.085
was a big man. Oh, yeah. And I kind of caught his 
shoulder as he was

20:22.306 --> 20:27.295
going down, but it was too late. And he just fell 
down on his back. And I ran and got those for him. By

20:29.476 --> 20:36.929
the time we got back to him,

20:29.476 --> 20:36.929
he was coming to me. I did the same thing. Yeah. It's 
pretty funny when a big man falls flat. But I

20:43.261 --> 20:47.488
remember that very clearly. I think I did it. He was 
a patient most of his life. He had malaria, he had

20:54.039 --> 21:01.067
tuberculosis, been in hospital for a year. He had 
heart problems at all times.

21:07.994 --> 21:10.417
You never know what's going on in the face. In the 
face, why is he doing it? In the face activity or in

21:13.761 --> 21:18.826
the style of life? The style of life. Now, when you 
come to college and start work, what kind of work do

21:20.725 --> 21:29.015
you do? How would you describe

21:29.536 --> 21:42.451
the level of activity or who do you

21:29.536 --> 21:42.451
work with? Well, we were doing 16 books. Margaret 
and I were doing all of the copy editing ourselves

21:43.532 --> 21:48.218
and working with the authors after. Frank

21:48.991 --> 22:14.825
was doing most of the acquisitions. It was a very 
close-knit group. We had weekly meetings. We'd

22:15.967 --> 22:17.188
all get together and discuss every project we had 
going. Frank would tell us about what he felt was

22:17.208 --> 22:18.610
coming along in the future. And so we were

22:19.518 --> 22:43.974
all working

22:19.518 --> 22:43.974
very closely with all of the projects and all of the 
books that were published. And working closely

22:43.994 --> 22:45.175
with Ray and the design and the layout. And I 
started September 1st, and on September 2nd, the

22:45.195 --> 22:46.778
first two books came in. Chip and Skip. Elizabeth,

22:48.155 --> 23:07.643
John, and the others were great. So we

23:08.324 --> 23:14.113
had the reason to celebrate the rest of the crew, 
even though I hadn't worked with them for years. So

23:14.133 --> 23:17.257
they made me feel right at home. I didn't want to 
starve. What

23:19.019 --> 23:44.344
was your first major project? I think the first 
book I worked on was my first book in the Zachary

23:44.364 --> 23:46.266
Sponsored Economics series. It's a Tony Kopp's 
book, and I can't think of the title of the book yet.

23:49.310 --> 24:05.446
Zachary

23:49.310 --> 24:05.446
did not want his name associated with him. Neither 
did this guy, Hugh, who we have a photo series. My

24:13.535 --> 24:14.035
question is, I have not used any. I use pews and 
equipment, so if you really wanted to dig, you'd

24:17.346 --> 24:27.123
find out who sent the winches out there. I don't 
know anything about pews, so he was pretty

24:27.744 --> 24:29.407
successful. Yeah, I know. Which pew was that? It 
wasn't. Marion. No, no, no. P-E-W. P-E-W. Frank

24:39.479 --> 24:43.647
got it all with Garbo, too. And that's why he said, I 
don't know a lot of P's. They're always P-E-G-H's.

24:48.517 --> 24:53.387
And I never seen a P as in church before. It was 
really cute, that cute letter. Yeah. And for the

24:56.303 --> 25:01.873
same exact reason, I don't know whether Bozo's 
name, I don't know. I'll have to look them up. Let's

25:04.398 --> 25:06.241
see, I don't know. Somewhere I've got my old blog 
book. I suspect now they wouldn't mind having it in

25:09.687 --> 25:16.119
there.

25:17.241 --> 25:20.126
I like to do that. Excuse me. That's okay. I didn't 
know. I don't know about you. I knew that... It's a

25:26.327 --> 25:30.210
Monte series, but Monte gave $10,000. He gave 
$20,000. Is that right? Which is interesting. At

25:34.935 --> 25:37.597
least he really was anonymous. Yeah. Tierboden, I 
believe, was counting the honchos in the tsunami

25:39.299 --> 25:45.545
series, but I think he wasn't. He had been on the 
first... the first board. And

25:51.658 --> 26:08.079
I guess he

25:51.658 --> 26:08.079
helped try to raise that money to make this 
project. Anything else other than the cops? Well,

26:09.761 --> 26:15.468
I was trying

26:09.761 --> 26:15.468
to find a law firm. Oh, okay. I saw it just the other 
day. I'm not going to pull that out. with Vince

26:19.514 --> 26:20.750
Branson's book. As I understand it, it was being 
developed by the Agricultural Experiment

26:21.370 --> 26:30.060
Station. So we transferred it over here. And 
Frank, in fact, paid them $10,000 for their

26:31.221 --> 26:40.431
previous services. They had done everything up to 
the point of giving it back. And so to supplement

26:47.279 --> 26:50.382
the prices. Do

26:50.851 --> 26:58.201
you remember any details about that acquisition? 
I mean, was it offered? No, that was before I came.

27:01.946 --> 27:04.028
That was one of the first things. Well, that, you 
know, regardless of, you know, the rules. Yeah. I

27:09.395 --> 27:09.876
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't 
know. Okay.

27:44.484 --> 27:44.584
Okay. So, let me ask you, in the early months there, 
or whatever year, did you encounter, in your

27:45.779 --> 28:09.450
relationship

27:45.779 --> 28:09.450
to the press, a particular faculty or former 
students who seemed to be intensely involved in

27:45.779 --> 28:09.450
press activities? Oh yeah, such as? It was Haskell 
Monroe who was the head of the press committee, and

28:14.635 --> 28:38.297
Haskell was very active

28:14.635 --> 28:38.297
and very willing to

28:14.635 --> 28:38.297
do his costuming at the press, and this too, 
talking about projects. had

28:38.851 --> 29:04.302
a real diplomatic uh at the time we were really 
searching for books to fill out that 15 or 16 a year

28:38.851 --> 29:04.302
we had to scramble and other people Maggie's

29:06.712 --> 29:13.363
and former students' class, they were very eager 
to give us an idea of STEM. That's...

29:40.428 --> 30:04.231
After

29:40.428 --> 30:04.231
all these

29:40.428 --> 30:04.231
years, we're really just down the drain. We've 
done a few books over the years in architecture,

30:04.251 --> 30:06.514
but it says that we've never been able to raise any 
money. Publications, for example, they always go

30:06.534 --> 30:07.675
down the drain. Now with Malcolm Clark, Cheryl 
Sears, we're going to be able to get more and more,

30:07.695 --> 30:10.097
you know, closer to our next project. with the 
school here in Houston.

30:17.536 --> 30:44.303
When

30:17.536 --> 30:44.303
I was at Illinois, they probably picked up the 
title. And

30:45.228 --> 31:12.585
after I got here, he said, oh, I turned around back. 
that I decided

31:13.308 --> 31:27.271
that the stories in that title were

31:13.308 --> 31:27.271
a little too strong. Was there an audience that you 
were trying to reach? There is. In fact, I was

31:32.600 --> 31:33.882
thinking about that.
