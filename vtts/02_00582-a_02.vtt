00:01.600 --> 00:15.821
Now,

00:01.600 --> 00:15.821
you were working in an advertising firm when the 
Depression begins, is that correct? And your work

00:15.841 --> 00:18.084
doesn't ever suffer during the Depression? Oh 
yes, it suffered. The main thing, we didn't have a

00:21.189 --> 00:24.233
preponderance of weight. And our council was very 
small. It was Anderson and Clayton. We had a house,

00:27.030 --> 00:29.052
all of them, and some advertising. But we had 
what's called a subsidiary of Anderson and

00:29.072 --> 00:35.298
Clayton, like Southern Baggin and other places. 
But we just had nothing to do with it. It was a

00:37.400 --> 00:38.321
leisure place. And by the same, that didn't help me 
to get along with my finance. We had time weekends

00:42.466 --> 00:44.227
at night. But I kept on essentially pencil work 
because that was a medium that I had found myself

00:44.247 --> 00:50.094
in. And I had Chip. I had brought that in a while ago 
while I was in New York. And I got this story in the

00:53.727 --> 00:58.536
magazine, Eberhard Faber Pencil Company, old 
Brooklyn. They got in touch with me, sent somebody

00:58.556 --> 01:01.361
over to look and talk to me. And they talked me to 
come over and work with them on testing out

01:01.382 --> 01:05.069
different pencils. And they got a beautiful 
brochure around New York of my pencil work with

01:05.089 --> 01:09.557
National. But that's when I got, say, absorbed 
with pencil work. And it's a tremendous medium.

01:14.827 --> 01:16.410
You don't think it isn't because they use it. It's 
fascinating, but it offers so much, and people

01:17.150 --> 01:22.158
don't realize the hardness of the pencil. I've 
tried everything. It goes from a 7-H onto a 6-B.

01:26.485 --> 01:28.848
That's about 10 pencils, but barefoot edges. But 
I've experimented. I learned to feel on different

01:30.150 --> 01:32.895
papers, and I've made it. It was such a tremendous, 
absorbing thing. But that's why we do so much

01:35.759 --> 01:37.742
pencil work. I've got it done. In a sense, only 
pencil work. And at the moment, I'm going back to it

01:40.466 --> 01:44.052
again. But, of course, it's a forgotten medium. I 
might say not forgotten, but it's an ignored one.

01:51.010 --> 02:01.189
And it takes a lot of basic, well, sometimes when I 
get up there, I can show you just what I mean, why you

01:51.010 --> 02:01.189
can use the procedure with pencil. But I stay with 
every hard favor, or just off and on, but I got

02:01.209 --> 02:06.799
advertisements out for them, and brochures. And 
it was good to use in architectural work and

02:07.808 --> 02:13.236
everything. But that's what artists nowadays do 
not get into that realm of things, that basic

02:13.256 --> 02:20.205
drawing, I might call it, with pencil. Pencil is a 
medium to use, because I try to use all of them now,

02:20.226 --> 02:25.072
but everything is available. Every day there's 
something new that comes out, and I just say, well,

02:26.394 --> 02:30.800
let's give it a fling. It's a challenge. It's a 
constant challenge. There's so much of it in art.

02:35.467 --> 02:37.630
Of course, I'm devoting it to my subject, But I went 
across the agency. I did a tremendous lot of work

02:43.351 --> 02:46.574
for Humble, if you know what I mean. See, that was 
one of the breaks I did get. I called it the

02:49.177 --> 02:50.658
breakers. I worked like Humble Company, Standard 
Oil. I worked for them. I was sent out into the field

02:54.102 --> 03:00.269
constantly and on expense account. Yeah, but you 
were freelancing, though, when you were with

03:00.289 --> 03:03.292
Humble, were you not? No. I was with the agency, no. 
I was a partner in the agency, but I was not on

03:05.054 --> 03:07.296
salaries. I was free of that, but I didn't want it. I 
wanted to be a free agent. So I stayed with them and

03:11.555 --> 03:19.838
got, because my participation with the agency did 
what it wanted, but I stayed with the agency for

03:11.555 --> 03:19.838
contact. No one wanted it that way, but I went out on 
my own, got everything piecemeal. But then I

03:25.096 --> 03:28.560
picked up some others too, other accounts on my 
own. Dow Chemical, I did a lot of work for them,

03:28.600 --> 03:32.244
independent of the agency. But they wanted it 
because it didn't hurt them any to have the name

03:32.264 --> 03:36.829
clients. I had some bigger accounts there. This is 
in the 30s still? No, that was way back. I'm jumping

03:43.677 --> 03:45.479
the gun on you. But I went through the usual 
routine. Now, because you were with Humble Way and

03:49.598 --> 03:53.445
so forth in the 40s and 50s. Well, yes, I was there, 
but we got Humble accounts in, I think, 1934 when we

03:53.465 --> 03:58.454
picked it up. It started with the house organs at 
that time, the lubricator and the beads. And the

04:02.461 --> 04:06.669
Humble Way, which came later on into the 40s, we got 
instigated to Humble Way. And that's when I got the

04:06.749 --> 04:09.935
Texas sketchbook and everything. Because they 
sent me on the road. They wanted to get... this

04:13.477 --> 04:18.321
particular phase of it, I don't know if it's the 
texana in it, but the romantic side of it. I had a

04:18.341 --> 04:29.552
friend, Tank Fields, was my partner in this type of 
thing, but we traveled, researched, but that was a

04:18.341 --> 04:29.552
beautiful assignment, a Texas sketchbook. Then 
we did The Prince, I don't know, just, well, having

04:30.553 --> 04:38.760
this sort of, some amazing answer, but it might be 
two or three hundred for The Prince, something

04:30.553 --> 04:38.760
like that. But I was constantly, Right with my fine 
art, to some extent. You make competitions. I'm

04:44.773 --> 04:47.216
not advertising what these are, pictures. All 
that's fine art. And they made, of course it was a

04:49.339 --> 04:51.743
beautiful relation job. I say for humble, it was 
good for me, but I got recognition. I mean, sacred

04:55.429 --> 04:57.732
image. Believe me, you need one. All the talent in 
the world don't help if you don't have content. I

05:02.499 --> 05:09.690
was so fortunate in that respect that I had my 
association with business, the business world,

05:11.003 --> 05:26.230
And on end of it, there's some wonderful patrons, 
but I've had a much better break than so many

05:11.003 --> 05:26.230
artists have had, because not any outstanding 
talent, but I had the connections. Believe me,

05:26.250 --> 05:27.392
they count. I'm telling you, but I've seen some 
beautiful talent that never could get on to first

05:29.095 --> 05:34.885
base because they didn't have anyone. You have to 
have a good dealer if he's for you, he can help you,

05:35.185 --> 05:40.511
but a good dealer, but it's a hard road. God, you're 
sick of it. So many of them, they're turning out

05:42.674 --> 05:48.300
now, but some of them are magnificent artists. But 
you're striving for recognition, you just have to

05:48.861 --> 05:52.025
be patient. But I just put myself up, it's not a, 
it's getting things, it's a hard way, I might call

05:53.346 --> 06:03.218
it that, but it was tremendously worth it, God, 
yes. Now, while you were working with the, you

06:05.712 --> 06:12.423
stayed with the advertising agency all during the 
30s then? Yeah, oh yeah, 30s and 40s and 50s, and

06:12.443 --> 06:15.628
then the early 60s. I had two partners went to war, 
at reserve offices when the war was, 42 or 43. But

06:23.199 --> 06:25.263
they went and left the agency on my hands. I was 
overnight, guess what? Buck, it's yours. We had a

06:31.943 --> 06:39.732
meeting with the directors, stockholders, had 
some humble people in the agency, had stock in it,

06:31.943 --> 06:39.732
and so did Anderson Clayton. They want to close it 
up. They had a meeting, said, Buck, this is it. We

06:42.516 --> 06:44.978
said, oh, sorry, but there's no one to carry us. 
They said, whoa, you're going to give me a chance.

06:48.683 --> 06:50.645
Don't you do this to me. We're going to keep this 
thing going. And if it doesn't prove hard, I'll

06:53.368 --> 06:57.673
step aside very quickly, easily. And so we did, and 
they said, all right, well, give me a vote of

06:58.430 --> 07:02.876
confidence, God bless you, you know. Now all of a 
sudden, overnight, I have, I'm with the second

07:02.916 --> 07:09.444
biggest agency in the state, and I had a thing of the 
administrator. I said, well, now, oh, I ran

07:09.524 --> 07:13.930
scared, God, for Watkinson. Whoa, that's a little 
praying hole in me. So, well, I won't go into all the

07:16.193 --> 07:19.678
detail, but they had a lot of dead wood in there. I 
got rid of all the dead wood, and the agency says,

07:19.698 --> 07:23.042
this is a house kicking. Then I brought in key 
people, even Atlanta, the West Coast, and put them

07:26.864 --> 07:31.631
in there and allocate it the right way, and have 
them all the same way. But I learned another thing

07:31.651 --> 07:34.275
in the administration. The best of my ability, but 
I mean, top of everything, get confidence in your

07:35.296 --> 07:44.009
personnel, which I did, your participation, and 
everything, but it was beautiful. And they came

07:44.589 --> 07:46.172
back, they couldn't believe it. We got the cars 
held up, didn't get in the red. So I turned over to

07:49.877 --> 07:53.903
his agency, that would have gone four years, I 
think. Thank you. Oh, he had another time over, but

07:54.964 --> 07:56.787
he was, I had a problem, you know. I got booted out of 
the Army. I had the finest career anybody could

08:01.364 --> 08:07.196
have ever wanted, right at the top of the range, but 
he couldn't contain himself. But anyhow. Was it an

08:08.920 --> 08:10.282
alcohol problem? Oh yeah. They all had them, some 
of them, my own. No, it's a nemesis. I've had it all

08:17.254 --> 08:20.198
along, but I've had to find answers to that too. But 
it got into this terrible environment. Oh my God,

08:22.882 --> 08:27.628
20 hours a day, but this gold, please. So, no, 
that's why I didn't want to have to find answers for

08:28.409 --> 08:38.964
that and start a whole new career. But it's 
terrible how much of it is transpired in

08:39.464 --> 08:44.391
advertising agencies. I don't have the clients to 
entertain them all the time. No. But... Well, when

08:49.878 --> 08:53.181
did you find your place at Quirrell? About a year 
ago. About a year ago. Well, before that, though,

08:56.965 --> 08:58.226
you were... I was here. Yeah, but you... Oh, I know 
that. But, I mean, before you came here, though,

09:00.408 --> 09:03.351
you were out in the hill country for a while. Oh, 
yes, I was there. We had our place, a beautiful

09:04.032 --> 09:06.174
place in the hill country. Uh-huh. And we were out 
there, and that was terrible. That was the worst

09:08.936 --> 09:13.821
thing that ever happened to me because when they 
got back and watched Joe and Paul come, Thank you.

09:15.523 --> 09:16.584
They said, thank God. Now you need to rest, Buck. 
Thank you. Oh, what a beautiful cloud of glass.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.268
Yeah, goody, goody, goody. So what? And I said, 
what you want you to do is go back to your place and

09:22.849 --> 09:28.655
hunt and relax and retire. Well, I went up there in 
the dead of winter. It was desolate. We didn't have

09:31.457 --> 09:35.221
any summer homes or anything like that. And that 
was a horrible experience. That's when I really

09:37.443 --> 09:39.344
got no pride, no problems. Yeah. Now, let's say 
that you go to hunt when, Buck? When do you go to hunt

09:43.248 --> 09:44.449
then? Oh, I just, I don't hardly go to all of them. 
No, I mean, when did you go to hunt? In 45, 46? We

09:49.413 --> 09:54.840
bought the, no, because we bought this hunt place 
back in 19, it was in 34 when we bought the hunt

09:49.413 --> 09:54.840
place. Okay. And we just kept it as a summer place. 
It had those houses on it. And finally, I went to

09:58.545 --> 10:03.812
hunt more or less after I got back from the war. They 
got back and went up there to try to carry on with my

10:03.832 --> 10:07.777
work, paint and just go ahead. But I couldn't 
attack myself. There was tremendous letdown.

10:11.562 --> 10:11.702
Mm-hmm. And that ain't a forlorn, there's nothing 
like a communication. Here I was with artists,

10:16.270 --> 10:25.263
businessmen, all of a sudden, why would, with your 
people out there, they're beautiful people, and

10:16.270 --> 10:25.263
what they say, well, what be you doing this 
morning, things like that. I didn't have any, no

10:25.284 --> 10:27.807
communication. And somebody just come and say, 
gee, I like what you're doing, I like this new book,

10:27.827 --> 10:31.913
but never. But you need that. Not to go ahead and 
build up your vanity or your, self-confident, but

10:38.885 --> 10:40.990
I just need it down there. Just get a kind word. It's 
better than all the monetary remuneration you can

10:42.192 --> 10:46.481
get. I'd say, I think in my mind, I like, don't want 
to praise, but I do like a few kind words. Yeah, and

10:51.552 --> 10:54.378
don't you want to talk to people about your work? 
Oh, yes. My God, yes. Oh. It would seem to me like the

10:56.907 --> 11:02.835
New York experience would have been, for example, 
for you to broaden yourself in the sense of talking

10:56.907 --> 11:02.835
to people who were doing other things. Oh, yes, 
that's right. But in my, in talking in my

11:03.997 --> 11:08.403
vernacular, my God, yes, that was the beauty of 
that New York. And I worked with these, the top

11:08.423 --> 11:13.471
people there, I mean, Hodders, Pentland, they 
were, they were top performers. And I worked, I

11:13.551 --> 11:16.254
served apprenticeship on them. The Hugh Ferris is 
a marvelous

11:16.274 --> 11:21.121
one. And, uh, I went up to see him, showed him my 
work, and said, gee, I'd like to use you part-time.

11:26.290 --> 11:27.211
He said, you want to come up? And so between four and 
five, or four to six and a half, I'd go to work with

11:27.351 --> 11:31.016
him. Or Precious, just pick up. Then I'd go to 
others. I learned pencils through Otto Eggers,

11:34.101 --> 11:37.866
another one, and Chester Price with Wolfman. But I 
went to, and they took me in so beautifully.

11:41.431 --> 11:42.272
Because I wanted to learn. I said, you've got 
potential. And they, because that's where I said,

11:44.315 --> 11:46.758
another big advantage I had. But I would like to 
work with a top performer. Well, you can get a lot of

11:50.840 --> 11:53.223
it to hurt you, but it's like teaching art. They can 
destroy it. Art teachers can destroy you very

11:54.065 --> 11:56.769
fast. I've seen some. Anyhow, but I said I had a 
beautiful advantage. But everything, you know, I

12:01.716 --> 12:05.782
look at it, and I seem to fall into place all the 
time. I get dead desperate at times. God, God, I'm

12:08.826 --> 12:11.470
mad at you. I was doing this A&M series here when I 
stayed there two years. There was a booger.

12:16.818 --> 12:18.300
Because there was something important. It was 
wonderful to do it. It wasn't always highly

12:20.995 --> 12:30.165
inspirational, the architecture wasn't, and all 
those things, but I had to try to do the best I could

12:20.995 --> 12:30.165
with it, namely just putting kids in there, and 
bicycles and things like that, and honorizing.

12:30.185 --> 12:43.459
But I spent two years, you know, that thing, but I 
enjoyed that because I did, I've done innumerable

12:30.185 --> 12:43.459
sketches the first year that I haven't shown 
anybody yet, but the preliminaries, I'd ride,

12:30.185 --> 12:43.459
they'd call it, they'd ride bicycles, and then, 
and building a bonfire. I spent a week out there

12:43.479 --> 12:46.783
watching them when they pulled those, The log was 
up by hand, and I got a whole series on that. In fact,

12:50.536 --> 12:52.518
I hadn't even seen it. I was talking to somebody 
about, yes, they're buckwires, and she said, my

12:52.538 --> 13:00.987
God, Wayne, why can't we use those somewhere down 
the line to show how you arrived at these things?

13:01.908 --> 13:03.570
But I hadn't given it a thought. But that was a 
really rugged one. But I stayed up here. Of course,

13:08.275 --> 13:09.957
I liked associating with Frank. Being here was, we 
always meet what you call top performers,

13:10.357 --> 13:16.163
whatever people, good writers. nationally known 
people. Now this next week Alfred Knopf's coming

13:17.537 --> 13:20.040
down. He's one of the great book men in America. But 
he's going to be here for lunch and guests. And all

13:25.026 --> 13:26.848
of these people are going to come. But they're 
marvelous people. They're big people. And it's

13:31.093 --> 13:33.896
been a tremendous asset to me. Because it gave me 
some of my self confidence. Because they are so

13:35.938 --> 13:38.722
humble and beautiful. But the bigger they are, I 
find out, the more delightful they are in

13:38.842 --> 13:44.428
understanding. But I'm going back now tomorrow. 
I'm trying to finish my wake up at Westhoff, where

13:48.022 --> 13:54.612
I'm on right now, for the third book. And they want 
me to stay on here, but I don't want to right now. But

13:56.855 --> 13:59.178
I got the Freedom up there, till you see it. 1100 
acre range, I'm right in the middle of it. It's old

14:01.602 --> 14:05.067
custodian, got all my beautiful cattle, and 
carpentry, and cattle, nature. But it's a

14:05.708 --> 14:08.112
delight. Then I come back here now, but this place 
has been held for me. I went to see Jack Williams the

14:12.944 --> 14:21.374
other day, the whole afternoon with Jack and 
Margaret and told him about what I was doing and

14:12.944 --> 14:21.374
said, Buck, just do what you want to do. This place 
will always be yours. I said, I may want to come back

14:22.816 --> 14:25.379
sometime. It's been a long tenure, I don't know. 
I'm not going to make any plans no more. Don't pin me

14:30.665 --> 14:31.446
down. Don't fence me in. But I mean, it won't work.

14:38.746 --> 14:44.275
When they come back from the war then, Buck, in 
1945, then you, then you go out to... To go to Hunt.

14:44.415 --> 14:45.577
Then you go to Hunt for a while. Yeah. How long do you 
stay at Hunt? Oh, I guess a couple of years. It was a

14:50.144 --> 14:54.090
devastating, but it almost polished me off, I must 
say. Then we came back to Houston. They wanted me

14:55.412 --> 14:56.694
back at the agency. They had, they said, got a new 
place. So I joined, and then I went to find this

14:59.058 --> 15:01.201
place on Lubbock. We had a marvelous old 
apartment. I reconverted, and I started back here

15:02.623 --> 15:06.289
with the agency. And had a nice go with it. I was very 
happy. I got back with what you call associations

15:10.535 --> 15:13.541
that I needed. That's a load. And you get to see good 
shows and even exhibits sometimes. You had all

15:17.729 --> 15:21.416
these private galleries I could run around and I 
could see what my fellow artists were doing. You

15:21.817 --> 15:22.659
have to have it. Some artists don't, like you take 
Winslow Homer. He was tremendously introverted.

15:29.354 --> 15:32.197
I mean, he just almost despised this fellow man. 
And he threw rocks at people. I talked to some of the

15:33.718 --> 15:35.380
people who went up there. The interviewer, he 
said, he and his gardeners got into trouble. I

15:40.205 --> 15:41.266
mean, he even had a gun. But he didn't. But look what 
the way he accomplished that. See? You can go ahead

15:46.591 --> 15:53.417
and allocate your time to idle visitations and 
people who have nothing to contribute and beat you

15:46.591 --> 15:53.417
to death. But you have to be very discretionary and 
discretionary in who you're associated with,

15:53.437 --> 15:59.243
too. Now, you continued your own work, though, 
when you got back to Houston in 47, because you

15:59.746 --> 16:04.592
paid... Oh, I came here. Yeah, you paid a whole lot 
between 47 and... Oh, yeah. I think I got more than

16:08.077 --> 16:09.719
five knots there. And, of course, Meredith Long 
took me on about eight years ago, I guess. Now, when

16:17.249 --> 16:23.917
you come back and you rejoin the agency in 47, did 
you freelance, too, then, about it? Oh, yeah.

16:24.258 --> 16:25.299
Yeah, I freelanced in 47. I said I did work for Dark 
Chemical, one of the big towns. I did them. Not for

16:29.446 --> 16:31.169
them, not even for DuPont. I went down to the coal 
mines in Peonia, but you're talking about

16:32.010 --> 16:37.018
something, in Colorado. Got on in there with a man, 
he had a sketch just like this. Couldn't use any,

16:41.124 --> 16:49.437
couldn't take pictures, but I want to get, I want to 
get, I'll show you all that, but people don't know

16:41.124 --> 16:49.437
that I worked for DuPont in the coal mines, which I 
did. Well, I didn't realize you'd been with

16:49.457 --> 16:51.059
DuPont. Now, I knew you'd been with that when you 
worked for Humboldt. Yeah, but I just worked for

16:53.122 --> 16:56.708
DuPont, too. But that was a booger. Yeah. I read 
about these people being trapped like that, so I

16:59.045 --> 17:05.034
felt all the time when the beam was going to come 
down. Well, it was interesting.

17:11.443 --> 17:19.335
And then when you, by the 50s you were working all 
the time with Humboldt, almost all together.

17:19.395 --> 17:21.478
Humboldt took other assignments on. We had the 
City National Bank, that big new bank building,

17:21.498 --> 17:26.385
but we had about 25 accounts. And I did actually, 
when I had Coon Paint Company, I took a look at some,

17:26.787 --> 17:32.935
Dental Maze, Ms. Bear's Bread, Sanitary. But I 
designed all the posters and the land, everything

17:33.255 --> 17:36.499
for those people. I don't know how I did it now. I 
couldn't. But it was just, I don't know, but it just

17:39.142 --> 17:42.306
said, damn it, you got to do it. But it was rough. How 
large was the agency then? Oh, well, I think at that

17:47.533 --> 17:53.200
time, we were about at least third in the state of 
Texas. There was Tracy Lock Dawson. You know, over

17:55.340 --> 17:59.608
here there's some Glenn Advertising Agency, and I 
served as a big top performer. We had about, didn't

17:59.628 --> 18:04.698
have to do the whole size, but 25, more than that 
person there. So when you would, when you did the

18:05.860 --> 18:10.429
layouts, would you do the whole layout yourself, 
or would you assign it to people? Oh, I assigned,

18:10.449 --> 18:17.382
finally I got to where I got a coterie of artists 
that do special types of things, good layout

18:10.449 --> 18:17.382
artists, the ones that do away from certain food 
products and all those figures, but no, and then

18:17.885 --> 18:38.297
we'd form stuff out to different, I had a lot of 
freelance artists start coming to Houston, we'd

18:17.885 --> 18:38.297
just form work out, but the layouts, but I did more 
finish work, I guess, in every category, except

18:17.885 --> 18:38.297
real, but I did a lot of figure work, people don't 
realize, illustration, too. I did, but, no, my, it

18:39.659 --> 18:42.964
hadn't, I haven't divulged too much of what I've 
done, actually, to people not aware of the work

18:43.349 --> 18:48.415
I've done in advertising. I think I'll be now on the 
Times the humble way, in my two books, in the Texas,

18:48.435 --> 19:00.370
but that's as far as, I mean, advertising, I've got 
just as much of that, and of course I still have all

18:48.435 --> 19:00.370
that. I'll bring it back and keep some of it, but I 
haven't tremendously done it. By this time,

19:09.303 --> 19:12.607
you're talking about roughly the mid-50s 
someplace. And you're on the road a great deal.

19:14.149 --> 19:16.632
When did you decide to leave the agency? I didn't 
leave the agency. Well, it was about 66, I think.

19:21.238 --> 19:21.519
66. 66, yeah. In fact, I got this retirement status 
at that time. But I never did leave it. They kept my

19:29.349 --> 19:30.190
office. They said I didn't have to retire. It was a 
reminder. We were submerged by the McCann Air

19:36.217 --> 19:39.141
Force. than the New York people, because they just 
changed the whole ballgame for us. I mean,

19:45.075 --> 19:51.064
approaches like technical motivation, 
research, and all that type of thing. But it

19:51.084 --> 19:51.605
worked. But we had time trying to get adjusted to 
that. But we sold out our stock, too. I sold my

19:56.973 --> 20:00.078
mechanics every bit of it. And when I left, of 
course, they told me that. Well, thank you, blah,

20:01.760 --> 20:03.122
blah, blah. God bless you and all that. This office 
is yours as a memorial." Hell, I wasn't going. I

20:08.389 --> 20:09.852
said, whenever you're back, it'll be there. Just 
open it up and go back. In a week, I had all the

20:13.238 --> 20:18.306
Yankees, a couple of Yankees were in there 
already. They called me up. Nice people. I said,

20:20.150 --> 20:21.993
well, that's the nature of the game. I didn't care.

20:27.232 --> 20:29.915
Did you go back to hunt then in the 60s? I somehow 
have you placed there in the 60s, Bob. I was there in

20:32.877 --> 20:34.819
the 60s. Yeah, we went back and gave it another try 
after we got out. Oh, we kept our Houston place. We

20:41.786 --> 20:47.031
had a nice home in Houston on Auburn Street, West 
University. Came back there now and then, but we

20:47.131 --> 20:51.155
just stayed and hunted periodically, I must say. 
We kept it mainly in summer and spring and fall, but

20:51.815 --> 20:56.800
in winter it's just not good right now. I'm tempted 
to go up there. But I would go back now, and of

20:59.064 --> 21:02.733
course, we have a beautiful spot. Oh my God. One of 
the finest places on the river. But I have 12 acres

21:07.625 --> 21:12.116
up there, and it's worth quite a sum of money. So I 
don't know what to do with it, but anyhow. But of

21:16.304 --> 21:22.454
course, the thing was, Ruth Lee was working up 
there too, and she was very strong with the UDC, the

21:16.304 --> 21:22.454
Daughters of the Confederacy. She was a 
historian, but she, magnificent work she did for

21:22.474 --> 21:27.262
them, research and making plans. But she's gone. 
Dead hospital three years now, just down, down,

21:29.766 --> 21:32.871
down, just a vegetable. But there's a woman, one of 
the most remarkable talents, being a women's

21:34.093 --> 21:38.059
talisman. But she just, I could have happened to 
me. I said, why in the world have you? Well, the

21:43.860 --> 21:49.567
doctor said, but it's uncanny the way you 
survived, which had been true. But right now, then

21:49.747 --> 21:54.612
I had, I was paralyzed in 74 completely. The side 
went out. I was laying in a wheelchair in a walking

21:57.015 --> 22:00.919
frame and finally everything came back. Yeah, I 
remember that in 74. Man, that's how you feel. You

22:04.204 --> 22:05.025
lay out there. I was 14, I was out there in the rocks. 
I couldn't even move. But it's one of those things,

22:08.829 --> 22:11.211
well, good, you know, it happened. Maybe that's 
what you should have happened. I don't talk, look

22:12.892 --> 22:15.935
very philosophical, acceptance. Then I had this 
cancer operation, which was last year, July.

22:22.261 --> 22:24.603
Found this thing started acting up on my leg. Boy, I 
didn't pay attention to it. I was just doctoring,

22:26.405 --> 22:27.526
you know. It was Sharon Steen. She was my business 
manager, the oldest person. When she saw it, my

22:33.254 --> 22:37.638
God, I said, you're all really in trouble. So I see 
this doctor, I don't go to that, Dr. High in Cuero,

22:38.499 --> 22:46.327
and he said, well, that's Anderson. They ran a 
camera, whatever it is, and said, you're going

22:46.367 --> 22:50.371
straight to Anderson. Which they did, and then he 
ripped me open, took me out, and put cotton seeds on

22:50.391 --> 22:55.316
or something, and took a lot of me. But that's all. I 
mean, it was another month. It had been too late.

23:00.441 --> 23:01.202
I'd been up here. But I went through that, and I feel 
about as well as I've felt in my life now. And I've

23:04.948 --> 23:08.232
been exercising for a long while, but I just feel 
like I'm leaving. When did you decide to come back

23:08.712 --> 23:10.214
to A&M? In 72? I was 72. It was later than that. I came 
to A&M, S.C. I must have been 74. I came up here. I had

23:23.007 --> 23:24.509
a paralysis. I had to come out. I came up after that. 
This thing here, I was fortunate. I was here before

23:30.976 --> 23:32.618
Frank came in. I was here before since, yeah, 72. 
Oh, yeah. But I went on back to hunt. But I was here by

23:38.126 --> 23:44.195
myself until Frank, they moved, saw this 
wonderful Bailey here, came in. It was what they

23:44.215 --> 23:45.236
wanted. So the press came. And then Frank wanted me 
to join up. They said, we want you to be part of this

23:48.942 --> 23:50.945
thing. I said, I'll go along with you. I was a kid, so 
I've had a nice build up. They've been beautiful

23:55.311 --> 23:57.113
people to be around. But Frank, My association 
with him has been tremendously rewarding at

23:58.321 --> 24:10.040
Rosemary's of mine, but I don't know, everything I 
have, of course, I've had rosebud, but it's been as

23:58.321 --> 24:10.040
a beautiful pattern for me. I always look at 
something, what is this thing? I've learned to

24:13.806 --> 24:18.092
accept it, but sometimes it bewilders me, it 
really does. Why? Why am I still around? See? But

24:23.262 --> 24:25.365
I'm functioned by Elizabeth. So maybe there's a 
purpose. But of course, the Steens were beautiful

24:26.746 --> 24:29.790
to me. I went down there for the Turkey Festival. 
They had bought our place, our charity, over here.

24:37.459 --> 24:43.146
Our old house, and they had, oh, God, they did a 
magnificent job of refurbishing their wealthy

24:37.459 --> 24:43.146
people. And they had this big ranch in the west over 
there, 100 acres. So I just went out there and spent

24:45.429 --> 24:48.713
a week in that big ranch house. I said, I don't want 
to go back there. There's a freedom. And I stayed on

24:53.384 --> 24:54.645
and on. I called back and said, when are you coming 
in? He said, in a week. I said, I don't know. Jack

24:59.170 --> 25:00.432
said, Buck, you're a resident. I said, you ought to 
come back now and just raise it. I said, Jack, I'm

25:03.695 --> 25:05.658
going to give it every consideration. He's 
laughing. No, but I will. But I want to retain this.

25:10.022 --> 25:11.945
I don't know what's in store. Maybe I'll be back. 
But it's not, it's a little bit too confining for

25:14.227 --> 25:18.172
me. This is just a little room in the boarding 
house. I spread my wings. Was there anybody close

25:24.205 --> 25:26.808
to you when you were a queer old? Just out there by 
yourself? Well, I'm not supposed to be. I'm not

25:30.171 --> 25:32.414
supposed to drive a car by myself, but I do it all. 
No, I said, when you say you can't do it, I said,

25:34.035 --> 25:36.177
well, hell, I can't. I mean, it's a silly, as a 
childish attitude, but that's the way I feel. No.

25:42.684 --> 25:46.568
No, it's stubbornness that's supposed to be. 
Buck, you've probably become now, in the last six

25:46.588 --> 25:51.353
or seven years, the best known of the Texas 
artists. I guess so. What's been your reaction to

25:53.719 --> 25:55.042
that? Because as we've been talking, you know, 
certainly I suspect even in the 50s, you know, when

25:55.102 --> 26:07.966
I first began your stuff with Humble Way, you 
weren't really that well known as a fine artist.

26:07.986 --> 26:11.492
No, until Meredith took me over, of course. I've 
had some good luck, but he gave me what's called

26:11.512 --> 26:14.758
image. He's a good man, but he gave me these two 
beautiful shows that started me out, because it

26:14.857 --> 26:23.553
came almost a sell-out. He had one last October. It 
went over good, and I've got a new deal in Dallas

26:25.336 --> 26:29.724
with Meredith, and they're going to take a damn 
view of it. I'm not married to Meredith, but this

26:30.065 --> 26:36.677
Bill Baker, they've got a marvelous brand gallery 
in Dallas. But he took me. I took nine of my pieces

26:39.055 --> 26:41.819
out, they came to see me. He said, oh, let me have 
them. But I said, I'm not, but I am not obligated to

26:43.041 --> 26:45.244
marry. But he said, we need, I need, I want to get 
into North Texas, too. Why not just confine myself

26:48.569 --> 26:51.834
to the, to marry this little premise? So, he's 
going to have this huge opening up there, March the

26:52.855 --> 26:56.641
25th. God, what a magnificent gal he's put in. But 
he, he's got my things up there, and he's already

27:00.387 --> 27:04.613
sold quite a few. He said, But I'm not out to make a 
killing and all, I'm not, but I just wanted to

27:05.228 --> 27:13.558
perform, because it's nice to have a substantial 
income. You bet. You bet. I did, because that's

27:15.701 --> 27:17.823
another thing in my favor. But I've made lots of 
investments in stocks and things. I've got a

27:20.987 --> 27:22.649
dividends company. I've got a source of income 
outside of my own by investments. It's a place I

27:27.755 --> 27:32.721
would hunt for, $80,000 or more. I don't, it don't 
mean, I just want to be comfortable. I said, I ought

27:35.656 --> 27:41.645
to go out now, boy, this kid come here, get me a Rolls 
Royce Silver Cloud, and look and say, hey, you

27:35.656 --> 27:41.645
peasants. You know, but that's, but I got smaller, 
I don't care about that. No, I should be a world

27:47.673 --> 27:54.322
traveler, but I don't kind of, of course, I 
wouldn't want to go out and kick up my heel, but

27:47.673 --> 27:54.322
she's hopeless. You know, you got to do something, 
oh, that is really a terrifying experience. Not

28:00.070 --> 28:03.315
terrifying, but sorry to go to state hospital. And 
intense care wasn't sick.
