00:02.596 --> 00:07.887
The boy track coach said, you show Coach Thomas how to go up that wall.

00:07.907 --> 00:09.431
I didn't even know what he was talking about.

00:09.451 --> 00:13.499
He gave the guy two broomstick handles about that long, about a foot long.

00:14.261 --> 00:16.786
And they had this thing going up the top of this gym.

00:16.847 --> 00:18.951
You know how a basketball gym is.

00:19.235 --> 00:22.498
and they had these holes in the wall about a foot apart.

00:22.779 --> 00:29.426
So he takes his stick and walks up just stiff, just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, all the way up to the top, comes back down.

00:29.486 --> 00:34.251
I was flabbergasted, because I mean, that took strength, and he was just like a statue doing it, you know.

00:34.932 --> 00:36.073
Just like that, I mean.

00:36.674 --> 00:39.016
So I knew he'd be a great track man.

00:39.036 --> 00:49.107
I said, well, I want to give you a full scholarship, and I'm going to try to teach you to throw the javelin, and you can be a sprinter, run the 100-yard dash, run on the relay team,

00:49.087 --> 00:50.168
and throw the javelin.

00:50.188 --> 00:58.116
I said, with your arm, if you stand there and throw a football 100 yards, you'll make a javelin throw.

00:58.797 --> 00:59.518
That's what I did.

01:00.318 --> 01:01.820
He threw the javelin too.

01:02.080 --> 01:08.146
Anyway, he ended up being the first black to score football at Texas A&M.

01:08.287 --> 01:13.592
That's what I was going to tell you, the reason I was after his sophomore year.

01:14.028 --> 01:17.414
Gene Stallings finds out or hears that he was a good football player.

01:17.434 --> 01:18.657
And he asked me, I said, yeah.

01:18.697 --> 01:20.220
I said, what they told me.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.602
I said, all I know is what they told me.

01:21.622 --> 01:23.586
They said, you can't throw a ball if he can't catch.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.752
And he can stand still and throw one for 80 yards.

01:26.852 --> 01:28.755
You know, I said, he's just a great athlete.

01:28.856 --> 01:35.007
So anyway, they get him out and he goes down to LSU and wins LSU games.

01:35.830 --> 01:41.978
Now, were you, was track the first athletic program to have black athletes?

01:41.998 --> 01:42.619
Yes, uh-huh.

01:42.799 --> 01:46.184
Yeah, there wasn't a single black kid when I brought them in.

01:46.284 --> 01:46.805
Everybody?

01:47.265 --> 01:57.439
The reason I know that for sure, I went back and looked at my school catalog to be sure, and this was the head of Shelby Metcalfe and them bringing in some black.

01:57.459 --> 01:58.641
And everybody was positive.

01:58.701 --> 01:59.922
Nobody was negative.

02:00.143 --> 02:00.864
Right.

02:00.884 --> 02:04.048
All right, let's go then to academics for all of the track.

02:04.737 --> 02:11.825
When you first got here, did anybody give you any advice about academics here and how to deal with?

02:12.685 --> 02:14.948
Yeah, well, not really.

02:15.008 --> 02:18.291
Everybody knew that it was tough.

02:18.311 --> 02:27.301
And, I mean, when you recruited, I mean, everybody knew that A&M was a top academic school, primarily in engineering and things like that.

02:27.401 --> 02:30.044
I mean, they were ranked.

02:30.284 --> 02:33.107
And everybody, we all knew how hard it was.

02:33.830 --> 02:40.541
Yeah, that was real good.

02:40.942 --> 02:47.813
But the first thing you did, see, you'd check like a boy was running a hundred and nine-five.

02:48.814 --> 02:54.724
You wouldn't call the coach, you'd call the business office or the library deal.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.804
and get his grades.

02:56.824 --> 03:02.370
And then if he had the grade, then you'd call the coach and make an appointment like that.

03:02.990 --> 03:11.399
And when they got here, what kinds of courses did y'all have them take, particularly the first year?

03:11.419 --> 03:13.602
Well, they just took the courses.

03:13.642 --> 03:16.865
See, that's what I didn't know about A&M.

03:16.885 --> 03:24.373
Because when I was at Texas, just like myself, my freshman year, I took a Bible course.

03:25.315 --> 03:30.741
And for the first two or three years, every athlete at Texas University would take Bible.

03:31.041 --> 03:34.585
Well, those Bible classes, you'd make an A or B, and you didn't have to study.

03:34.605 --> 03:35.906
You'd just go in and, you know.

03:36.647 --> 03:44.996
But I come to A&M, I was wondering, well, you know, because especially freshmen, you want to give them one or two classes because they had to pass nine hours to be eligible.

03:45.857 --> 03:48.640
But A&M, there wasn't no such a thing as no easy classes.

03:48.940 --> 03:52.766
I mean, if they want to take Bible over there, they could flunk that Bible.

03:52.786 --> 03:55.390
So I found that out real fast.

03:55.410 --> 03:56.712
We didn't have a single class.

03:57.193 --> 04:03.362
I did not have a single class to put all these years that I've coached.

04:03.382 --> 04:05.265
No easy classes.

04:05.365 --> 04:11.976
I mean, every freshman had to come in here and take English and history and whatever.

04:11.996 --> 04:12.957
All right, let me tell you this.

04:14.877 --> 04:15.658
This is bad.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.022
It's good and it's bad.

04:19.144 --> 04:21.608
Randy Matten said, he's throwing a shot put.

04:21.628 --> 04:22.850
He sets the world record.

04:23.691 --> 04:24.974
And I'm out trying to recruit.

04:25.034 --> 04:25.414
All right.

04:25.715 --> 04:31.384
I get a phone call from what country?

04:32.444 --> 04:35.207
over in Europe.

04:35.227 --> 04:37.390
This guy says, I'm so-and-so.

04:37.450 --> 04:42.356
He said, this is Texas A&M University, Randy Madison School?

04:42.656 --> 04:43.257
I said, yes.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.840
And he said, you're the track coach?

04:45.900 --> 04:46.561
I said, yes.

04:47.042 --> 04:48.784
He said, my name is so-and-so.

04:48.864 --> 04:50.626
He said, I'm six foot and five.

04:50.706 --> 04:52.749
I weigh 275 pounds.

04:53.249 --> 04:59.557
I'll throw the shot put or whatever he said, like 12 pounds.

04:59.897 --> 05:01.219
High school, like

05:01.874 --> 05:04.378
70 foot, you know.

05:04.398 --> 05:06.781
I mean, better than anybody that's ever thrown in the world.

05:08.043 --> 05:09.645
Boy, I fell out of my chair.

05:10.406 --> 05:13.531
He said, I want, I'm interested in coming to Texas A&M.

05:13.551 --> 05:19.219
So I called him back and forth, and I think I'd get Randy to write him a letter or something.

05:19.379 --> 05:22.043
So he decided to come to Texas A&M.

05:23.660 --> 05:27.485
He comes and it's late in the year.

05:28.106 --> 05:32.613
Washington and Southern Cal, Kansas, everybody wants this guy that knows about him.

05:32.973 --> 05:35.477
You know, I mean, he knows Randy Mattson coming up.

05:35.497 --> 05:36.818
And that's the reason he's coming to A&M.

05:37.579 --> 05:41.365
Because I told him about our weight program and, you know, and all this and that.

05:41.385 --> 05:44.349
And Randy would come out and help him, teach him some things.

05:45.390 --> 05:47.053
All right, I sign him.

05:49.236 --> 05:50.658
All right, get the transcript.

05:51.078 --> 05:52.300
He comes in down here.

05:53.798 --> 06:01.569
I get the transcript carried over there, and he didn't have Algebra II, and A&M's an engineering school.

06:02.671 --> 06:06.757
And they said, Coach, we can't accept him.

06:07.959 --> 06:08.499
I said, why?

06:08.519 --> 06:09.601
He doesn't have Algebra II.

06:09.621 --> 06:18.574
I said, well, I knew he didn't have Algebra II, but him being from Europe, you know, and he's a world record holder, this and that, no problem, can't accept him.

06:18.723 --> 06:20.225
So I had to tell him he couldn't go.

06:20.325 --> 06:21.066
You know where he goes?

06:21.387 --> 06:23.470
He leaves here and goes straight to Washington.

06:24.772 --> 06:26.154
I believe it's Washington State.

06:27.716 --> 06:30.099
Who wins the shot put the next three, four years?

06:30.159 --> 06:31.020
That guy.

06:32.282 --> 06:33.484
And he didn't come to here.

06:33.744 --> 06:38.191
He didn't want, and I told him, I said, he don't want to take, and this was the old registrar.

06:38.211 --> 06:40.574
This was the head registrar, old guy over there.

06:40.594 --> 06:41.235
Mr. Heaton?

06:41.255 --> 06:41.355
Yeah.

06:41.993 --> 06:45.358
I said, he don't want to take engineering, you know.

06:45.378 --> 06:46.039
It doesn't matter.

06:46.059 --> 06:47.421
We got the school rules.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.025
All right, let me tell you another deal on the grade.

06:51.427 --> 06:53.089
I had a guy named Ilhan Belgutti.

06:53.109 --> 06:55.472
Now, that was the first big recruit I did.

06:56.714 --> 06:58.036
Ilhan Belgutti.

06:58.837 --> 07:00.119
Ilhan was from Turkey.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.803
Not Turkey, Texas, but Turkey.

07:04.049 --> 07:13.124
All right, I get his, I mean, he tells me what all he, he's sort of like a straight-A student, smart, and runs like a deer.

07:14.186 --> 07:21.278
So I fly, well, we don't fly him in because we can't, you know, I tell him, you get here, we give you full scholarship.

07:21.298 --> 07:22.160
Well, you have to get here.

07:22.561 --> 07:23.442
But he gets here.

07:23.928 --> 07:26.052
bring a transcript and everything.

07:26.072 --> 07:27.355
I'd take it over at the Rector.

07:27.375 --> 07:30.601
I mean, this is just the last day to Rector.

07:31.302 --> 07:35.250
And I didn't get all that mail back and forth from Turkey.

07:35.270 --> 07:40.300
But he brings the transcript, brings all this stuff to him.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.143
and leave him.

07:42.183 --> 07:44.566
I come back, about an hour later, the phone rings.

07:44.586 --> 07:46.228
Coach Thomas says, this is so-and-so.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.352
He said, we can't let that guy in school.

07:49.653 --> 07:50.314
He's from Turkey.

07:50.394 --> 07:51.275
I said, why?

07:51.335 --> 07:52.937
He said, we can't even read the transcript.

07:52.957 --> 07:55.020
I said, we can't read all that Turkish.

07:55.861 --> 07:56.862
We don't know what it says.

07:57.503 --> 07:58.845
I said, we cannot let him in.

08:00.445 --> 08:01.226
I said, okay.

08:01.666 --> 08:05.471
I picked up the phone and I called Dr. Earl Rudder.

08:06.612 --> 08:07.553
I tell him the story.

08:08.675 --> 08:10.877
He said, I'll call you back in about an hour.

08:11.538 --> 08:13.240
About an hour later, the phone rang.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.902
He had registered.

08:14.922 --> 08:20.128
Attorney, he said, we decided, he said, Earl Rudder called me.

08:20.148 --> 08:24.533
He said, we decided to let him in school, but we're not going to let him be eligible.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.496
He said, you can go ahead and give him a scholarship.

08:26.856 --> 08:27.617
We'll admit him.

08:28.002 --> 08:30.585
And he said, nobody here can read that transcript.

08:30.605 --> 08:31.946
We don't even know what he wants to take.

08:32.447 --> 08:35.490
But he said, we're going to let him in, let him take anything he wants to.

08:36.612 --> 08:39.455
And if he passes nine hours, he can compete.

08:39.535 --> 08:40.836
But he said he can't compete.

08:41.757 --> 08:42.398
We let him in.

08:43.379 --> 08:44.901
You know what he makes the first grade?

08:44.941 --> 08:47.784
I mean, he makes straight A's.

08:47.804 --> 08:51.348
And he wants to be some kind of sort of like a doctor.

08:51.909 --> 08:52.830
Makes straight A's.

08:53.671 --> 08:55.092
All right, almost lose him.

08:55.192 --> 08:56.794
See, if he hadn't come from Turkey,

08:57.601 --> 09:03.129
I would have lost him, but this other guy, you know, would have lost him on the count of grades.

09:03.369 --> 09:06.774
And they couldn't find anybody to read the transcript.

09:07.816 --> 09:12.783
Describe Earl Rudder and your relationship with Mr. President Rudder.

09:12.803 --> 09:16.348
Well, that's how I got to meet President Rudder.

09:16.949 --> 09:26.443
And the first time I met him was when I was, let's see, there were two guys.

09:26.812 --> 09:29.516
when I was recruiting Willie Blackman.

09:29.536 --> 09:32.600
All right, that was my second black group.

09:32.900 --> 09:40.490
Willie Blackman was, I forget which school he's from, but he was sort of like an academic excellence guy.

09:40.510 --> 09:46.558
I mean, he was straight A and being a state champion and a great track guy.

09:46.718 --> 09:52.085
I mean, it was Harvard and Stanford.

09:52.105 --> 09:55.890
Harvard and Stanford and one or two of those other high military

09:56.444 --> 10:00.149
not military, but high academic schools, recruiting him.

10:00.209 --> 10:03.233
It had a good track program, and I was recruiting him.

10:06.277 --> 10:11.124
But later on, he told me, he said, well, Coach, I think I'm going to go to Stanford.

10:12.185 --> 10:12.866
I said, why?

10:12.906 --> 10:14.789
He said, well, I'm going to major.

10:15.269 --> 10:17.993
What I'm going to take, he said, A&M don't even have a class.

10:18.033 --> 10:21.538
They don't even have two classes that I can take.

10:21.658 --> 10:23.901
He said, I might go to Rice.

10:23.921 --> 10:25.523
He said, the president of Rice is

10:25.503 --> 10:27.205
trying to get me to sign with them.

10:27.325 --> 10:29.167
And they got those two classes at Rice.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.230
I said, I'm probably going to go to Rice.

10:32.471 --> 10:35.455
So I tell Earl Rudder that.

10:36.316 --> 10:42.404
And anyway, I carry him up to visit, and Earl Rudder showed him around and everything.

10:42.484 --> 10:47.069
And after he leaves, Earl Rudder called me.

10:47.089 --> 10:50.373
He said, Charlie, let me tell you what I told that guy, the black one.

10:50.393 --> 10:51.635
He said, I want black one.

10:51.655 --> 10:53.417
He said, we got to get black.

10:53.988 --> 11:00.444
He said, I told Willie, he said, we'll make a new degree program.

11:00.764 --> 11:08.343
If you come to Texas A&M, you'll get a degree that no other school offers.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.786
It'll be a different name.

11:09.766 --> 11:18.174
And he said, all I got to do is just add another class or two and add whatever, add another class or two.

11:18.194 --> 11:20.116
And he said, Willie graduate.

11:20.136 --> 11:21.477
He'll get that new degree.

11:22.138 --> 11:24.080
And that kind of hit me sell Willie.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.283
But I recruited Willie so long.

11:28.404 --> 11:29.925
And I'd take the whole family.

11:30.546 --> 11:32.447
I'd go down there and take the whole family.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.670
Sometimes it'd be 10 or 20 of them.

11:34.950 --> 11:35.791
And where was he?

11:35.811 --> 11:36.932
We'd take them out to eat.

11:37.712 --> 11:38.133
Where was he from?

11:38.153 --> 11:38.633
Houston.

11:38.653 --> 11:39.174
In Houston?

11:39.194 --> 11:39.334
Uh-huh.

11:39.770 --> 11:42.213
And I'd take him out right by the Astrodome.

11:42.233 --> 11:45.396
There was a real famous restaurant right there by the Astrodome.

11:45.716 --> 11:48.439
And he lived on the other side of the Astrodome real close.

11:48.459 --> 11:51.983
But I bet I've taken him out 15 or 20 times.

11:52.043 --> 11:57.328
I mean, the bill, you know, $150, $200, nothing for supper, you know.

11:57.468 --> 11:58.790
But that was standard, you know.

11:59.330 --> 12:06.558
And you'd want the mother and daddies to go, sisters and brothers, because you get them all recruiting the whole family, see.

12:06.598 --> 12:07.819
The whole family falls in.

12:08.221 --> 12:11.306
I presume that the mother was probably the most important.

12:11.346 --> 12:12.328
Yeah, right, uh-huh.

12:13.610 --> 12:13.870
Right.

12:14.932 --> 12:17.837
But anyway, I finally signed him.

12:17.857 --> 12:21.323
And President Rutter was responsible.

12:21.343 --> 12:23.246
And Willie turned out to be a good student.

12:23.266 --> 12:23.927
Yes, uh-huh.

12:24.448 --> 12:25.590
And he's a lawyer right now.

12:26.591 --> 12:28.154
Not a lawyer, but a judge.

12:28.174 --> 12:29.736
He's a judge in Houston.

12:29.756 --> 12:33.823
And the other, really I'm thinking about this, I get a phone call.

12:34.310 --> 12:37.703
This was after that, after that.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.940
No, this was before that.

12:42.140 --> 12:46.826
phone call, President Earl Rudder, boy, it scared me to death when I get a call from you know, you know what's going on.

12:46.846 --> 13:08.151
President said, this is Earl, Charlie, he said, he said, if you got any scholarships, he said, you may not even have to give this guy a scholarship, but he said, down there in the valley, he said, this Latin guy down there, this Mexican guy down there, he said, he's a great student, he said, he's a half miler and a miler, he said, I think he's going to win state.

13:08.752 --> 13:11.235
He said, we really want him to come to A&M.

13:11.215 --> 13:14.381
and I didn't know why.

13:14.421 --> 13:17.226
I thought they knew each other, kinfolk.

13:17.246 --> 13:31.652
It didn't even dawn on me that he was Latin, so I go down there and visit with him, and boy, he's about 6'1", 6'2", nice-looking kid, you know, straight-A student, I mean, smart, so he'd go to state and win class B or something.

13:31.712 --> 13:32.533
It was a small town.

13:32.593 --> 13:35.198
I've been through that town going fishing to

13:35.515 --> 13:38.218
When you go to Del Rio, you go to San Antonio, you take a ride.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.441
He lived way back down in there.

13:41.463 --> 13:45.307
But Earl Rudder, I didn't even know about the guys.

13:45.327 --> 13:50.494
And how Earl knew about this guy, he must have come down here in the academic or something.

13:51.635 --> 13:53.538
But he wanted me to recruit him.

13:53.558 --> 13:58.785
Of course, I mean, it didn't dawn on me that no way in the world would I offer him a high scholarship.

13:58.805 --> 14:04.712
I mean, when Earl Rudder said, go see this guy, I mean, that's a full four-year scholarship right there.

14:05.013 --> 14:09.498
I didn't care whether he could run a hundred or a half mile in five minutes or not, you know.

14:10.519 --> 14:14.183
After Mr. Rudder's death, Jack Williams became president.

14:15.404 --> 14:16.926
What was it like to work with him?

14:17.166 --> 14:18.067
He was real good.

14:19.208 --> 14:34.665
I never did get personally with him, you know, but a lot of time would take, you're a good athlete, you'd take them by and visit with the president a lot of times, like Randy Mattson and some of those guys.

14:34.966 --> 14:37.309
Let's talk about recruiting Randy.

14:37.329 --> 14:38.891
Tell me that whole story.

14:40.093 --> 14:41.675
Well, that was a long process.

14:41.715 --> 14:49.044
I recruited him for a year before, well, about two years, about a year and a half.

14:50.826 --> 14:56.113
And I had club, Aggie club, writing him letters.

14:57.173 --> 15:04.662
And like some, I get one from Germany, and I'd tell the president, I mean, this was easy at A&M.

15:04.683 --> 15:07.967
You get to pick up the book, and you got all that stuff written down.

15:08.007 --> 15:13.514
And all Aggies are true Aggies, and they all want to help you any way they can.

15:14.054 --> 15:18.520
So that was one of my habits.

15:18.540 --> 15:26.370
Every year, all these years at A&M, I'd call the president of A&M club, and the number two deal, call the women's.

15:27.245 --> 15:30.130
The mother's club, and that was a big deal.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.114
I found that out, and that helped a whole lot.

15:32.655 --> 15:44.816
But anyway, I would get them, I'd say, I need you to get as many as your people, and I'd mammograph a list of things, what they did and this and that, so they would know a little person about them.

15:44.836 --> 15:50.907
I'd send the president of these clubs that, and then he'd pass it out to the members, and then they'd write letters.

15:51.224 --> 16:01.219
But I'd have it spaced out for, you know, every week he'd get a few letters from here and maybe some from Scotland and some from New York and different deals.

16:01.239 --> 16:04.124
And that kind of helped, you know.

16:05.386 --> 16:08.451
When did you first go visit Randy?

16:08.551 --> 16:10.133
When did you get serious?

16:10.153 --> 16:16.523
Well, first time I went to visit him was out there in,

16:19.102 --> 16:25.062
not Lubbock but Pamper

16:25.345 --> 16:28.008
I had a rent car.

16:28.949 --> 16:40.240
All right, I went out to drive him around, and the first thing I said to him when I met him and got in the car, we started driving.

16:40.320 --> 16:45.325
I said, Randy, if you come to Texas A&M, A&M will not buy you a car.

16:45.906 --> 16:50.590
That's the first thing I said because, I mean, that was a lot of that stuff going on in those days.

16:50.610 --> 16:54.154
I mean, if you were real good, somebody's going to buy your car.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.680
I said, A&M will not buy you a car.

16:56.901 --> 16:59.646
I said, we will not do anything illegal, Randy.

17:00.308 --> 17:02.352
I said, we'll do everything.

17:02.412 --> 17:06.160
I said, as far as spending money on you, we'll send you anywhere you want to go.

17:06.220 --> 17:13.875
If you want to go to New York, and we did that several times, but he got to be so good that he'd turn down trips.

17:14.216 --> 17:15.619
People would be begging him to go.

17:15.970 --> 17:17.692
to New York indoor meet.

17:17.812 --> 17:20.234
No, I had to miss three or four days of practice.

17:20.534 --> 17:23.417
And he would miss meets.

17:24.197 --> 17:27.680
In fact, we went to New York to the indoor big track meet one time.

17:28.261 --> 17:41.533
And Friday night or Saturday night, we'd go back and Brandon said, I want you to get me a weight workout Sunday morning before the plane goes in the weight gym.

17:41.553 --> 17:45.336
And I had to find a gym with weight for him to work out because he didn't want to miss a day.

17:46.177 --> 17:48.099
of working out on the weights.

17:48.119 --> 17:50.282
That's how dedicated he was.

17:50.302 --> 17:52.986
And he turned down trips on top of trips.

17:53.086 --> 18:03.979
I mean, trips to Germany, trips to New York, and anybody else would have given a million dollars if they had it, just to go to a truck meet like that.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.744
But Randy would turn it down, because he didn't want to miss the practice.

18:07.764 --> 18:07.884
Right.

18:07.904 --> 18:12.370
Now, when you went out there, you met his family.

18:12.603 --> 18:16.549
What was your first impression of them and Randy's interest in A&M?

18:17.810 --> 18:23.639
They were just regular, common-type, honest-type people.

18:24.460 --> 18:37.058
And I didn't know before they, when I first went out there, whether I had much of a chance to get them or not, because he told me to start with that it was five schools that he was going to visit,

18:37.527 --> 18:42.314
and he was going to pick one of those five, and of course it was A&M and Texas.

18:42.735 --> 18:44.137
And Kansas.

18:44.317 --> 18:45.138
And Kansas.

18:45.419 --> 18:46.220
And Southern Cal.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.442
And Southern Cal.

18:49.044 --> 18:53.551
And the fifth one was, I don't think it was Oklahoma.

18:54.432 --> 18:55.173
They used to know.

18:55.193 --> 19:00.742
It was five schools, and Southern Cal was the one I was scared of.

19:02.364 --> 19:03.025
It wasn't better.

19:03.065 --> 19:07.011
It was Texas, but anyway.

19:07.345 --> 19:10.450
Right, and he visited here about last, didn't he?

19:11.030 --> 19:12.032
Yeah, I think so.

19:13.534 --> 19:18.962
He visited here during that Southwest Conference break because we were in Arkansas, I told you about that.

19:19.042 --> 19:22.808
And he'd already been to Southern Cal the previous week.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.290
Yeah, I think so, uh-huh.

19:24.310 --> 19:26.814
Yeah, it was getting down tight and everything.

19:27.896 --> 19:32.863
Right, when he came to visit, before he got here, did you think we had a good chance?

19:34.480 --> 19:39.666
Well, I thought we did, but those kind of deals you just don't know for sure.

19:39.686 --> 19:44.251
Did you ask John Lindsey and Jack Knox to help you with him?

19:46.213 --> 19:55.203
Well, yeah, but the way they got, it was, was it Shelby or Bobby Rogers coaching then?

19:55.643 --> 19:56.064
Shelby.

19:56.124 --> 19:56.744
Shelby.

19:56.764 --> 19:58.686
Sorry, it was Shelby.

19:58.706 --> 20:01.129
I got Shelby to help me recruit him.

20:01.430 --> 20:03.833
and Shelby lined up the Houston people.

20:05.295 --> 20:16.351
Shelby got Dr. Knox, and Dr. Knox had helped me recruit before, you know, and I mean, he never missed a basketball game, see.

20:16.411 --> 20:26.085
So when Randy said he might play basketball some, that's when Shelby, boy, Shelby got fired up over, see.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.707
So we both recruited him.

20:27.873 --> 20:35.099
When former students or other A&M people helped you recruit, what did you tell them about things not to do?

20:37.241 --> 20:50.413
Well, guys like Randy out there don't, don't smoke and don't, don't offer them a drink or something, because a lot of guys, you'd buy them a cocktail or something, you know, they thought that was a big deal, but.

20:50.433 --> 20:54.436
But you also must have had some other guidelines, don't offer money, don't own a car.

20:54.457 --> 20:55.217
Yeah, right.

20:55.237 --> 20:56.158
What were all those?

20:56.138 --> 20:57.620
Well, that was the main thing.

20:58.060 --> 21:01.805
Don't promise them any money or a car or anything like that.

21:03.106 --> 21:05.849
Sometimes you're afraid that'll hurt you too, you know.

21:05.910 --> 21:09.354
But, I mean, you can tell sometimes.

21:09.614 --> 21:11.917
But Randy, I mean, he was so straight laced.

21:11.937 --> 21:17.563
You just knew you had, I knew I had a better chance telling him that we wasn't going to buy him a car.

21:19.145 --> 21:24.171
See, when I was being recruited, I turned down three or four cars.

21:25.720 --> 21:29.086
And I went to the University of Texas and I didn't get a penny.

21:30.067 --> 21:46.075
But later on, the lady that took me to Texas, after my freshman year, I got married, end of my freshman year and I got married, I called her and told her I needed

21:47.506 --> 21:50.270
I needed something, and she sent me $150.

21:50.290 --> 21:54.615
But boy, I didn't tell anybody.

21:56.658 --> 21:58.380
That really wasn't illegal.

21:58.921 --> 21:59.802
But today it would be.

21:59.822 --> 22:01.084
But today it would be, oh yeah.

22:01.444 --> 22:04.508
All right, this is an editorial note to the typist.

22:05.890 --> 22:14.661
On the Saturday that Randy Mattson came to visit A&M with the track team at the conference meeting in Fayetteville,

22:15.468 --> 22:26.372
He was brought up here by two splendid former students, John Lindsay and Dr. Jack Knox, both from Houston.

22:27.500 --> 22:39.136
According to Randy's recollection, as they were headed up here, instead of taking Highway 6 out to Hempstead, they came up to Conroe and were planning to come on Highway 105, and they got lost.

22:40.498 --> 22:45.726
So when they finally got here, Randy said he wanted to meet some faculty, some teachers.

22:47.268 --> 22:55.279
And John Lindsay told him, well, that that year, for the first year, didn't have Saturday classes anymore.

22:55.816 --> 23:00.422
But he thought there would be some folks over in Nagel Hall that taught history.

23:01.244 --> 23:08.974
And so they came over there and I and two or three others were in the office of Professor Garland Bayless.

23:08.994 --> 23:18.748
And so we got to meet Randy and Donny Ayers, A-Y-R-E-S or E-R?

23:19.629 --> 23:20.951
E-R-S, I think.

23:20.971 --> 23:25.097
A-Y-E-R-S, who was Randy's

23:25.567 --> 23:28.790
good friend and eventually.

23:28.810 --> 23:32.674
See, that was another recruiting deal to help get Randy.

23:32.694 --> 23:39.121
I mean, it didn't hurt, but I think I gave him books and tuition to throw the javelin.

23:40.842 --> 23:44.706
And he made a good javelin thrower.

23:44.726 --> 23:50.272
Well, as we were chatting with them, I knew who Randy was because I was a real track fan.

23:50.452 --> 23:51.253
Uh-huh.

23:51.273 --> 23:53.295
I looked at Coach Metcalf

23:53.427 --> 23:55.470
and winked at him where Randy couldn't see me.

23:55.510 --> 24:02.862
And then I turned and asked if Randy was aware of the new rule about chapel.

24:04.004 --> 24:08.711
And I didn't know that he was a churchgoer and all that when I made this up.

24:09.732 --> 24:10.834
And he said, no, what is it?

24:10.934 --> 24:19.688
And I said, well, the faculty voted this week that all freshman athletes have compulsory chapel at seven o'clock on Wednesday morning.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.335
Mouth dropped open pretty wide.

24:24.095 --> 24:28.559
But he relaxed a little when Randy said, sir, if that's a rule, I'll go.

24:30.821 --> 24:34.344
Later, Shelby told me he wasn't going to bring any more athletes to visit.

24:36.887 --> 24:41.331
You flew back then from the conference meet to talk to Randy.

24:41.651 --> 24:45.334
Describe what went on from then on that weekend.

24:46.255 --> 24:48.477
Well, we just talked.

24:49.013 --> 24:52.698
And the same thing, he wanted to meet some, he wanted to go to classes.

24:52.718 --> 24:57.824
We had to go up and go into some buildings, and like I said, it was on a Sunday, I think.

24:58.004 --> 25:09.779
And I can't remember where we met any professors or not, but I remember trying to show him some buildings where he would go to class.

25:10.419 --> 25:14.845
Were you aware that Randy was a good student?

25:14.865 --> 25:16.607
Yes, uh-huh.

25:18.595 --> 25:24.582
What did you try to tell him or show him about the program here?

25:24.602 --> 25:33.112
Well, I just told him it was high caliber and everybody kind of knew that, you know.

25:35.715 --> 25:37.457
I just told him it was tough.

25:37.777 --> 25:38.598
You had to study.

25:38.658 --> 25:40.360
You had to make your grades.

25:41.061 --> 25:43.724
Do you remember what he said his major was going to be?

25:45.386 --> 25:46.527
What did he say he wanted to study?

25:48.481 --> 25:51.284
I believe it was business, but I'm not.

25:51.304 --> 25:52.705
Well, that's what he ended up doing.

25:52.725 --> 25:52.886
Yeah.

25:54.087 --> 25:55.368
I just don't remember it now.

25:55.749 --> 26:01.474
When he left to go back home, how did you feel about our chances?

26:01.495 --> 26:05.759
That kind of crossed my finger, just kind of 50-50, really.

26:08.542 --> 26:09.803
And how did he let you know?

26:09.843 --> 26:13.527
When did he let you know?

26:14.958 --> 26:17.203
I can't remember for sure.

26:18.185 --> 26:28.285
One thing, he told me that he was going to sign, after he told me he was going to sign as A&M, but it was going to be on a certain date, like a week away.

26:28.686 --> 26:32.173
And the reason he put it off a week, he had to call every coach.

26:32.626 --> 26:37.051
the other four coaches personally and tell them that he was not coming to their school.

26:38.112 --> 26:49.604
And I forget whether I called several times to find out exactly when that was, but I remember going out there and signing him.

26:49.624 --> 26:54.429
Did he ever tell you what it was that attracted him to A&M?

26:54.449 --> 26:54.710
No.

26:55.010 --> 26:56.912
We never did talk about it much.

26:57.770 --> 27:01.315
All right, then when he came, describe him?

27:01.355 --> 27:16.114
Well, he came in with Donnie Ayers and we gave him a room in Henderson Hall because that was a good, that was air-conditioned, nice, but wasn't anybody in Henderson Hall but football players and basketball.

27:17.155 --> 27:20.419
So Shelby said we'll give him a room, all right.

27:21.530 --> 27:25.264
And I told him that we had a little conflict there.

27:25.284 --> 27:29.279
See, I told him that he could room with Donnie Eyre.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.443
They'd be teammates.

27:30.727 --> 27:34.855
And I didn't know they were going to move in the basketball room.

27:35.236 --> 27:39.283
I was going to get them a room somewhere else where the track team stayed.

27:39.303 --> 27:44.834
Well, anyway, I don't know for sure, but they started moving into Kane Hall.

27:45.675 --> 27:54.051
And they get in there, and then they say that Donnie Harris cannot live in there because he's not on the basketball scholarship.

27:55.516 --> 28:02.506
I forget what all happened, but anyway, we had to get him a room up in the law hall, wasn't it?

28:03.468 --> 28:06.672
Right across from... In Hart Hall, wasn't it?

28:06.692 --> 28:09.056
In Hart Hall, yeah.

28:09.456 --> 28:16.006
So I get him a room in the fourth floor, and we had to pull up stuff with the ropes to get the bed.

28:16.547 --> 28:18.790
We took the bed and cane.

28:19.158 --> 28:29.188
So we had, we got that bed and put it in the, up there on, in his room, but we had to pull it up by rope.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.450
We couldn't get it through the door.

28:32.132 --> 28:41.641
As you started Randy's workouts, what was your first impression of him as a shot putter?

28:41.661 --> 28:43.583
Oh, he was a hard worker.

28:43.603 --> 28:46.026
And in fact, every Monday,

28:46.462 --> 28:55.010
My standard deal every Monday for everybody on the team would meet out at the mule barn, right across the track.

28:55.290 --> 28:58.233
We call it the mule barn, the horse barn.

28:59.474 --> 29:02.837
And I would run the whole team at like 5, 15.

29:02.938 --> 29:07.342
Monday was lab day, and everybody had to take late classes.

29:07.722 --> 29:09.864
Everybody got out of classes late on Monday.

29:09.944 --> 29:13.988
I made everybody take viewing chemistry or biology, whatever,

29:13.968 --> 29:20.917
All your labs had to be on Monday because they were five, for some reason they didn't get out of the lab until five o'clock.

29:22.840 --> 29:33.074
So at five, about 5.15 I'd have everybody to meet on a Monday down there by the Mew Barn and I had a time trial.

29:33.134 --> 29:39.823
I mean just with everybody on the track team, shot putters and distance men would run a race around the

29:40.158 --> 29:45.829
And I'd tell them, you know, to start with, I said, you walk a while and jog a while and walk a while until you build up.

29:45.849 --> 29:49.717
I said, we're going to do this for three or four months now until after cross-country is over.

29:49.957 --> 29:51.701
And this was the beginning of school, see.

29:52.342 --> 29:53.625
So we did that every Monday.

29:54.146 --> 30:00.799
And buying holes, Randy Mattson, he would almost win the whole shooting match in three miles.

30:02.146 --> 30:03.888
And ours was the same way.

30:03.908 --> 30:06.592
They were both competitors.

30:06.612 --> 30:10.777
And there was a javelin thrower and a shot footer beating all my sprinters.

30:10.878 --> 30:12.960
I mean, it wasn't a sprinter or a quarter mile.

30:12.980 --> 30:16.825
It could stay close to Randy Mattson.

30:16.845 --> 30:24.315
And then, see, they told me, well, he ran a 10, 2, or 3.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.458
They entered him in a track meet one time.

30:26.518 --> 30:27.800
And he won a 220.

30:29.102 --> 30:31.765
And I think he got second in a 100-yard dash.

30:31.745 --> 30:43.800
I mean he plays high in a big track and then certain times I'd make him run up and down stadiums out there and he'd sprint up and down that stadium like nothing flat.

30:43.941 --> 30:45.402
I mean just beat everybody.

30:45.422 --> 31:00.081
He was really, that's when I knew that in the pro football people started trying to get him to sign pro football and I knew he'd make a great football player because he was a great basketball player and he was fast and quick and

31:01.833 --> 31:04.436
And strong, you know, really coordinated.

31:04.456 --> 31:09.042
When did you begin to realize what a fine human being he was?

31:09.102 --> 31:13.547
Well, about where before I signed him.

31:14.228 --> 31:16.631
So you had an idea of the quality you were getting.

31:16.651 --> 31:19.114
Right, uh-huh.

31:19.134 --> 31:20.816
It just kind of rubbed off on you, you know.

31:20.876 --> 31:26.423
You just knew he was great.
