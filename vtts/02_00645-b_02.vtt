00:04.857 --> 00:26.848
Well, leading off of this last topic of the 
generality of the oceanographer, I'm wondering,

00:04.857 --> 00:26.848
since World War II, since the other sciences have 
become somewhat integrated in the study of

00:04.857 --> 00:26.848
oceanography and this somewhat of a generalized 
field, as opposed to the land sciences where

00:04.857 --> 00:26.848
people often are very specialized, would you say 
that there that this is a new frontier where

00:27.723 --> 00:40.340
something can be approached in a better way than we 
have done with land in terms of pollution, for

00:27.723 --> 00:40.340
instance, having the overall look at things 
rather than the specialized look. Yes. Are we

00:41.863 --> 00:46.809
getting a second chance with our approach to this 
new frontier of the ocean as opposed to what we have

00:41.863 --> 00:46.809
done on land? And how does that relate to it? but 
generalized it. Yes. This is a topic that

00:53.823 --> 00:56.647
interests me very much. You know, we really 
haven't used the ocean until this generation for

00:59.331 --> 01:15.853
much other than transportation and as a moat 
protecting us in wartime from other countries,

00:59.331 --> 01:15.853
from aggressors perhaps. We like to think of it 
those as being aggressors. Today, of course, we

01:20.673 --> 01:39.539
face the real problem of utilizing the ocean for 
many, many purposes, not the least of which is

01:20.673 --> 01:39.539
developing a sand and gravel, which comes to be in 
short supply in many land areas. And of course,

01:40.160 --> 01:42.363
petroleum, we well know.

01:46.229 --> 01:48.372
The difficulty with The ocean is that almost 
everyone that you can imagine identifies in some

01:48.858 --> 02:00.014
way with the ocean. It's either that he hasn't seen 
it and he wants to see it someday, or he's been on it

02:00.035 --> 02:10.951
and has learned to love it, or he hates it because of 
certain things. But at any rate, almost anyone you

02:10.991 --> 02:15.998
talk to identifies with the ocean. Not so with the 
land. We take this for granted. All right. Now,

02:20.737 --> 02:31.956
when it comes to using the ocean effectively, we 
have a very high degree of emotionality involved.

02:31.976 --> 02:38.908
And it is here that I think our emotions really 
begin to take over. In recent years, I've been

02:38.928 --> 02:43.857
rather heavily involved in public hearings. 
dealing with leasing of the continental shelf for

02:44.393 --> 02:50.240
oil exploration and production. And I have been 
involved in hearings for the disposal of certain

02:51.181 --> 02:59.852
kinds of industrial waste beyond the continental 
shelf. And as a consequence, I've come to feel very

03:01.113 --> 03:10.705
strongly that there is a very definite pattern of 
public reaction. to utilization of the ocean,

03:11.917 --> 03:17.204
much of which is unreal. Now, for example, I won't 
hesitate a moment to say that I feel that it is the

03:17.745 --> 03:32.285
ocean that is far less valuable to us than the land. 
And I feel that the air is much more important to us

03:33.547 --> 03:38.734
than the ocean. For example, I'll make a a 
heretical statement that I have thought about. It

03:45.544 --> 03:47.366
isn't just off the cuff. I think we could live 
without the ocean, but certainly we couldn't live

03:47.386 --> 04:02.763
for a moment without the air envelope, and we 
certainly shouldn't try to continue to destroy

03:47.386 --> 04:02.763
land surfaces in ways that we're doing today. What 
do we get? One percent of our food from the ocean

04:05.826 --> 04:08.569
even yet. And with the population going up as it is, 
I doubt that we'll improve much on that. If you've

04:15.937 --> 04:33.660
got 15 million new people, not replacement 
people, but new people a year in China alone, I

04:15.937 --> 04:33.660
don't really believe that we're going to increase 
the percentage take from the ocean. We will

04:35.422 --> 04:37.645
increase the tonnage possible. All right, what 
I'm saying is this. I think the elimination or

04:41.663 --> 04:58.378
disposal of certain wastes from products that we 
consider to be critical to man, and only if they are

04:41.663 --> 04:58.378
considered to be very important, should be 
disposed of in the ocean rather than the land. And

04:58.558 --> 05:06.805
furthermore, I think that if you wanted to trace 
the sanitary landfill approach back in history,

04:58.558 --> 05:06.805
you could go back to the Etruscans. I think that you 
clearly could look at the man who threw a chicken

05:07.898 --> 05:22.921
bone over his back and kicked some dirt over it as a 
sanitary landfill approach, or those who lived in

05:07.898 --> 05:22.921
caves, the cave dwellers who covered with a fresh 
layer of earth. So what I'm saying is we must

05:24.823 --> 05:35.880
utilize the full extent of our scientific 
knowledge of the ocean to make effective use of it

05:36.502 --> 05:39.626
to continue to better man's life. And if that does 
mean that we should effectively dispose of waste

05:39.706 --> 05:46.054
in the ocean, I think we should. I think that some of 
this has been very unreasoned. This isn't for

05:52.241 --> 06:05.918
rampant pollution of the ocean, but it is, I think, 
a very important thing that we utilize what we know

06:07.130 --> 06:11.256
rather than the hearsay material that we get. 
You've seen just recently in the Houston Post when

06:11.317 --> 06:25.198
Shell Chemical applied for an ocean dumping 
permit to continue dumping certain sludges from

06:11.317 --> 06:25.198
one of their wastewater treatment areas. And a 
captain of a fishing vessel, I suppose a charter

06:26.861 --> 06:35.314
vessel, testified that the flower garden a west 
flower garden reef, was now dead or dying. And as a

06:43.232 --> 06:52.804
consequence of this, he held up a piece of coral, 
which he said all the coral used to be sparkling

06:43.232 --> 06:52.804
white. And now when he looked down in the waters, 
all he saw was a brown blob. Well, not realizing, of

06:58.075 --> 07:06.866
course, that white coral that he sees underwater 
is dead and that the brown coral is living, if

06:58.075 --> 07:06.866
indeed he saw it. And then he maintained the fish 
population is going down, and yet he what?

07:12.093 --> 07:16.899
Indicated that on one day he took 13,000 pounds out 
of there in the good old days. Well, a reef with that

07:17.519 --> 07:27.492
kind of food source can't sustain a population 
even migratory. for that length of time, for any

07:27.826 --> 07:33.872
length of time with a fishing rate of that tax. So 
this is what I think is the epitome of the misguided

07:33.952 --> 07:50.206
individual using his emotions, and they said he 
was almost in tears, to attempt to control a system

07:33.952 --> 07:50.206
he doesn't understand. Now, this is inevitable, 
but the time must continue that the scientist gets

07:55.585 --> 08:02.993
his information across as best he can.

08:07.798 --> 08:21.913
I think this implies that more and more scientists 
must get into the real practical world rather than

08:07.798 --> 08:21.913
doing purely esoteric research. And I think this 
is happening. I think in the last five years we've

08:26.348 --> 08:30.914
seen much more of it, of this movement out. You 
know, you get it even in high sources. A man like

08:34.618 --> 08:39.123
Jacques Cousteau, for example, says the sea is 
dying. Well, Cousteau has a large public

08:39.964 --> 08:42.868
audience. He says this without any scientific 
background whatsoever. Really.

08:50.665 --> 08:56.073
He's got knowledge, but not a scientific 
background to make an assertion such as this. For

08:56.734 --> 09:01.682
example, Thor Heyerdahl said the same thing with 
his raft. He'd look out every morning and see all

09:01.762 --> 09:04.046
this crud. He was drifting with the current. He was 
seeing the same crud day after day. So this is one of

09:10.255 --> 09:15.964
those things that We have no doubt that certain 
aspects of the sea are being handled very badly.

09:23.522 --> 09:26.567
And again, we need to know what the sea can do for us. 
Now that's a long answer to that. It sounds almost

09:30.453 --> 09:32.116
like a harangue. But I've been needled a long time 
on that subject, the last five years.

09:41.645 --> 09:46.370
We are still not asking the ocean the right 
questions. With all the money that's going into

09:47.130 --> 09:57.441
biological research right now on the outer 
continental shelf, we're still not getting at the

09:47.130 --> 09:57.441
real mechanism.

10:02.085 --> 10:09.913
I believe that a large part of the ocean is 
sustained by the land, not by the primary

10:02.085 --> 10:09.913
productivity of the ocean itself. So what 
question should we be asking the ocean? Well, what

10:16.863 --> 10:35.513
we need to do is, as individuals, take a moratorium 
on running to sea to do research and attempt to

10:16.863 --> 10:35.513
design

10:16.863 --> 10:35.513
experiments at sea with equipment that is 
properly designed to give us the kind of

10:36.185 --> 10:45.893
quantitation we need to understand the system. 
Right now, we can make conceptual models of what's

10:46.314 --> 10:52.259
going on in the ocean. And yet, we can't quantify it 
to produce a mathematical model that makes much

10:53.760 --> 11:01.026
sense yet. And yet, this is going to be necessary in 
order to manage the neuritic or inshore aspects of

11:06.087 --> 11:10.792
the seed. Is this due to a sparsity of sampling or a 
too narrowing of the type of sampling that's being

11:10.812 --> 11:17.319
done? Yes, a little bit. The narrow approach, not 
necessarily too little. There were good samples.

11:28.492 --> 11:31.335
And the fact that we really don't have very good 
equipment even yet. Ten years ago, you could

11:35.138 --> 11:44.353
scarcely get a piece of equipment to work in deep 
water that wasn't in operation in 1890. And I

11:44.373 --> 11:50.863
think that sort of points up what I'm talking 
about. And yet most of us are not engineers that can

11:51.785 --> 11:57.795
do some of the things we should do. We need to have a 
greater input from engineering in this field, I

11:59.783 --> 12:06.411
think, to aid in that development. Well, what is, 
then, the benthic skimmer? Skimmer? Skimmer, I'm

12:10.136 --> 12:11.238
sorry. Oh, yeah. The benthic skimmer was, well, 
several students and I designed an all-metal

12:11.458 --> 12:28.980
device which could be pulled rather rapidly over 
the bottom of the to

12:29.399 --> 12:59.237
cut into the sediments at a predetermined depth 
and store the organisms in side pockets in the cod

12:29.399 --> 12:59.237
end out of the main stream of water so that we could 
get them by virtue of the speed we were pulling,

12:29.399 --> 12:59.237
which would overcome their speed, since we felt a 
lot of organisms were escaping us because of that.

13:04.634 --> 13:12.387
And yet, we could protect them from the main 
slipstream and thus bring these more delicate

13:04.634 --> 13:12.387
creatures up. It worked well enough, but

13:13.348 --> 13:24.125
my time in deep water, I've got all the data I need to 
finish this book. And if I've got any years left

13:24.806 --> 13:27.030
after that, I've got one or two things that I hope to 
do in the Gulf of Mexico before the 200-mile limit

13:27.415 --> 13:46.603
goes into effect, since I think this is going to 
create some real problems for oceanographic

13:27.415 --> 13:46.603
research. I think it's inevitable that it will go 
in, and I think it will mean that the paperwork

13:54.854 --> 14:01.841
before going to sea will be perhaps a year or two 
leap time before you can go out to sea and do what you

13:54.854 --> 14:01.841
want, if indeed you can do it then.

14:09.268 --> 14:11.710
Could you describe the Carnegie conference in 
1951? Who was there, whose idea was it, and what was

14:13.472 --> 14:21.199
your 51-52 really, and what you were trying to 
accomplish or do there? Yes. I was asked in the

14:25.032 --> 14:47.035
spring of 51 by

14:25.032 --> 14:47.035
John Gardner, who was then at the Carnegie 
Institute of New York,

14:25.032 --> 14:47.035
to take the place of someone else who was going to 
lead a symposium. I'd forgotten who that other

14:48.010 --> 14:55.782
individual was, but at any rate, through illness, 
I had to give up the plan. So what they wanted to do

14:57.304 --> 15:09.563
was attempt to bridge the gap between the foremost 
research activities going on in this country and

14:57.304 --> 15:09.563
the high school. they felt that the universities 
had a pretty good input into this and that that

15:10.758 --> 15:31.716
information could get to the university student, 
but it was not getting to the high school where most

15:10.758 --> 15:31.716
scientists are really formed. Most of them begin 
in the high school. And it was felt then that there

15:34.999 --> 15:39.803
should be a way of doing this. They hadn't worked 
out any protocol or any scenario at all. And so I,

15:45.984 --> 15:57.279
because of, again, certain things that I had done 
in pre-medical education, this sort of stuff, was

15:45.984 --> 15:57.279
asked if I'd do this. I indicated, yes, I would give 
it a try. So what I did was

16:01.544 --> 16:08.693
sit down and decide who were the, foremost 
scientists in the United States that could

16:09.128 --> 16:28.410
contribute to certain aspects of knowledge and 
began to invite them one by one to

16:09.128 --> 16:28.410
produce a program. I rounded, sort of roughed out a 
program that I had in mind. And then I had the

16:34.497 --> 16:38.562
problem of deciding how to select the high school 
teachers. And first and foremost, I wanted to try

16:39.132 --> 16:44.217
to get those that were considered to be the best 
teachers. I finally hit on the plan of asking

16:44.778 --> 16:59.153
students in various colleges and universities to 
nominate the people that they considered were the

16:44.778 --> 16:59.153
best teachers. And I didn't limit it to the 
students then in the university, but also to those

16:59.994 --> 17:08.683
who had left the university and in retrospect 
said, these are the guys the ladies or the men who

17:08.866 --> 17:12.571
had the greatest influence on me. And I then 
invited 100 of these people to submit their

17:13.612 --> 17:27.269
credentials, and I selected 25 of what I consider 
to be the outstanding teachers. And then went

17:28.230 --> 17:37.962
about getting the scientists to come. You're 
asking me to go back 25 years without thinking much

17:38.431 --> 17:49.624
about it, but I do know that I had James Bonner, who 
was one of the foremost plant physiologists. I

17:50.866 --> 17:59.295
invited Jack Calvin, who was then working on 
photosynthesis. Jack Calvin had had a heart

18:00.737 --> 18:04.141
attack, so he sent Andrew Benson. These men worked 
out along with a few others in this country,

18:08.620 --> 18:12.864
photosynthesis. And it was in that period that, 
for the first time, we understood what

18:12.885 --> 18:19.552
photosynthesis was. And it was very cleverly 
done. It was extremely clever experiments.

18:25.898 --> 18:29.342
Andrew Benson is now at Scripps, the institution 
of oceanography, by the way. He is not retired yet.

18:31.905 --> 18:35.168
I got Knight. who was the leading virologist of the 
time to come. I got George Beadle to talk about. And

18:44.603 --> 18:53.876
in 51, we didn't know DNA yet, but he brought DNA 
with him in 53 when he came back. But to speak on his

18:55.518 --> 19:03.990
understanding of the gene, I got Hubble, who was 
the foremost astronomer in the country to come and

19:04.426 --> 19:21.060
speak on his yardstick for measuring the age of the 
solar system, which, by the way, has been revised

19:04.426 --> 19:21.060
upwards several times, and he had just revised it 
upwards then. Harrison Brown, who was one of the

19:21.180 --> 19:31.229
most stimulating men to speak on geophysics from 
the Earth. Richard Feynman, who's still

19:31.589 --> 19:34.011
considered one of the most inspiring physicists 
of all time.

19:40.542 --> 19:44.145
Well, I got Edward Goldberg and Roger Revelle. We 
went and visited Scripps for a couple of days. We

19:48.429 --> 19:51.672
had some British oceanographers. All these 
teachers were treated as if they were red carpet

19:52.293 --> 19:59.919
individuals, I tell you. And they were good. You 
know, it disabused me then that all the brains are

20:03.556 --> 20:09.204
going to be in the University of Science. And it was 
not true. These men and women were very

20:10.446 --> 20:15.593
stimulating to the speakers. As a matter of fact, 
many of them became good friends. And well, then we

20:17.956 --> 20:24.265
went to UCLA to the medical school that was 
developing. And we were involved in the first

20:24.465 --> 20:30.373
heart surgery.

20:33.053 --> 20:40.463
and saw all the machines and what have you that were 
devised to bypass the heart during these

20:33.053 --> 20:40.463
operations. So it was a very stimulating 
experience, and I can't remember all of them. But

20:46.590 --> 20:59.387
once in a while, I looked back on the teachers, and 
most of them now, of course, have moved up to

20:46.590 --> 20:59.387
supervisors or in charge of education in the state 
of California or what have you. Unusual people. I

21:00.560 --> 21:04.547
called it Progress and Horizons of Science, as I 
remember. Fantastic experience. I kept it, I

21:08.535 --> 21:10.398
think, three years. Oh, no. Yes. Then National 
Science Foundation asked me to devise it for them.

21:18.052 --> 21:22.320
And I went on into 58, as I remember now, come to 
think of it. I had a long history of that. I forgot

21:25.535 --> 21:27.357
about NSF calling. It was because of that NSF asked 
me to come back and I took a job with them. It was from

21:32.383 --> 21:36.047
that that led to your associate directorship and 
then your directorship at NSF. Yeah. Would you

21:39.611 --> 21:41.373
want to describe your work at NSF? Yes. That was an 
unsettling experience at first. You know, coming

21:49.703 --> 21:53.247
from university and college work, uh where you 
were always grappling with budgetary problems to

21:54.340 --> 22:22.120
be introduced uh one day to your supervisors and 
nsf and the next day told you had a budget of three or

21:54.340 --> 22:22.120
four million dollars and spend it wisely was an 
unsettling experience you know i ended up with uh

21:54.340 --> 22:22.120
where i was put in charge orgy of special projects 
anything that came along that was unusual was

22:22.538 --> 22:50.233
given to me i unless i got oceanographic things i 
was sent by alan waterman who was then the director

22:22.538 --> 22:50.233
of the national science foundation uh for example 
in 1961 to century 21 in seattle to to negotiate to

22:51.007 --> 22:56.654
take over the science exhibit, the buildings. 
They put in a fantastic set of buildings out there.

23:00.299 --> 23:01.500
So this is the World's Fair. Yes. Century 21 in 
Seattle. Right. And Commerce, by the way, that's

23:05.305 --> 23:09.951
where I met Spielhaus. Spielhaus was the US 
commissioner of that exhibit. And I dealt with

23:14.397 --> 23:20.845
him, as a matter of fact, in taking that building 
over, that set of buildings over, from Commerce.

23:21.863 --> 23:23.806
They were declared surplus by Commerce. NSF took 
them over temporarily, and I negotiated that

23:24.407 --> 23:28.753
deal. And then we handed them over to a private 
foundation, of which the head then, well, it was a

23:29.955 --> 23:49.785
big committee, University of Washington and so on 
involved, but the head man was a hotel man by the

23:29.955 --> 23:49.785
name of Carlson, who is now, I think, president of 
United Airlines. But

23:50.423 --> 23:56.712
that was one of the kinds of things I did. At that 
time, I was invited to President Kennedy, asked

23:57.052 --> 24:19.283
Waterman to nominate somebody to represent him in 
Argentina at an oceanographic conference where

23:57.052 --> 24:19.283
it was going to be, what will the great Nord 
Americano do for the South Americans in

23:57.052 --> 24:19.283
developing oceanography? He was seriously 
contemplating going, and then it was considered

24:19.938 --> 24:27.768
that it would be too dangerous. There were lots of 
communists there for him to go. But for a

24:32.434 --> 24:36.178
nondescript like myself, it wasn't so bad. So they 
sent me down there. I got involved in this kind of

24:37.480 --> 24:41.145
special activity. And then I developed

24:41.265 --> 24:46.992
new programs to aid universities. I gave, for 
example, a major grant to Duke University to beef

24:51.516 --> 24:58.343
up their engineering. They'd been very poor. To 
aid Duke in developing a marine science program.

25:06.891 --> 25:18.261
And I created one of the first programs in 
hydrology in the United States and called

25:06.891 --> 25:18.261
together all of the leading water people in the 
world to a conference at NSF where we debated what

25:18.865 --> 25:38.950
should be done and finally roughed out a program 
and instituted it in several institutions, not

25:18.865 --> 25:38.950
the least of which was the then-developed 
University of Arizona, which has come forth with a

25:18.865 --> 25:38.950
really outstanding hydrology program. Matter of 
fact, I was offered a job at Cornell as a

25:39.082 --> 25:42.146
hydrologist. The guy thought I knew so much from 
this meeting, which I didn't. But that was the

25:48.675 --> 26:00.151
history of my life, a very special topic, very 
challenging, but a very exhausting work within a

25:48.675 --> 26:00.151
set. And my wife, Linda, who of course has a degree 
in oceanography,

26:07.617 --> 26:09.680
wanted me to get out of that administration. And I 
think on the side, she wanted to get her degree,

26:10.822 --> 26:13.987
too. And so it worked out pretty well, my coming 
here. Dale Leeper came back to one or two of my

26:18.373 --> 26:21.698
conferences. Dale was then chairman of this 
department. And finally, as a result of this, he

26:25.664 --> 26:33.716
kept telephoning me about every other month 
saying, when are you going to come down and visit us

26:25.664 --> 26:33.716
and join our department? So after a year, I We liked 
what we saw. And you didn't go then to SUNY at Stony?

26:42.787 --> 26:44.629
Oh, in between I did go to SUNY. I only stayed, I 
think, three months at SUNY. It wasn't long. Yes,

26:51.716 --> 26:52.757
it wasn't long. I roughed out a program, picked a 
site for their marine development.

27:05.414 --> 27:11.163
I carried my resignation around in my coat pocket, 
already stamped, ready to go. And finally one day

27:11.965 --> 27:15.310
it got so bad, I just dropped it in the mailbox. And 
after I dropped it, I phoned NSF and said, do you

27:15.831 --> 27:21.340
have an opening left that I could fill? And they 
said, yes, we surely do. You might have to take a

27:24.986 --> 27:30.595
demotion, but they won't be long before we promote 
you again. Got in the car with my family that night

27:31.317 --> 27:37.632
in the middle of a snowstorm, drove to Washington, 
and went to work the next day.
