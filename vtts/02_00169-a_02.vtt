WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:15.787
beginning to, he's learning a lot and spending a lot of time, and I think he appreciated what I was saying, that the land-grant university does have a built-in advantage if they utilize it.

00:17.108 --> 00:27.638
During the Rudder years, the 60s, under, well, under Dr. Hutchinson, I should say, was there any other state that you all had as a kind of a model?

00:28.859 --> 00:29.920
Well, I guess we were,

00:30.929 --> 00:34.536
Provincial or what was the other term?

00:34.556 --> 00:35.197
Not provincial.

00:35.358 --> 00:36.941
We always thought we were the biggest and the best.

00:37.803 --> 00:43.734
But there were some states that I suppose that we helped us.

00:44.977 --> 00:48.364
We often looked at Iowa in terms of things that they did.

00:49.285 --> 00:50.608
Cornell had some

00:50.588 --> 00:59.056
innovative type things, and there was a lot of sharing, because we got together frequently at the national and regional levels in the southern states, North Carolina.

00:59.076 --> 01:02.880
Surprisingly, North Carolina has the second largest extension service.

01:02.900 --> 01:03.260
Did you know?

01:03.681 --> 01:03.921
No.

01:04.502 --> 01:13.290
Well, see, part of the financing formula from federal funds is based on number of farms, and they got jillions of farms because of these two- and three-acre tobacco farms.

01:14.371 --> 01:20.477
The formula still is based on number of farms and number of farm population.

01:20.457 --> 01:23.420
All right, let's go to the Century Study.

01:24.161 --> 01:33.089
Share what you recall about the Century Study and the Aspirations Report and its relation to the Extension Service.

01:33.149 --> 01:36.132
What was your part in it and anything else that you recall?

01:36.152 --> 01:37.874
Well, I don't know.

01:37.894 --> 01:49.705
I mean, there are some positive things in the final report, I think, about Extension and research and agriculture and so forth, but the preoccupation with the task groups, what do you call them, task forces?

01:49.685 --> 01:51.897
was mostly with the academic programs.

01:52.218 --> 01:53.907
And then, of course, the research.

01:54.671 --> 01:56.742
I think a lot of the attention was that

01:57.683 --> 02:06.595
you know, recognizing the importance of resources to get named people, you know, into the institution and this type of thing.

02:06.615 --> 02:10.641
But Extension did not get discussed a whole lot per se, I would say.

02:10.801 --> 02:17.189
Did Extension have any feelings about non-compulsory cohort, co-education, racial integration?

02:17.210 --> 02:19.793
No, I don't think so.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.036
The main thing is that we want to support.

02:22.777 --> 02:24.059
I thought we were going to finish today.

02:25.821 --> 02:26.282
I digress too.

02:26.382 --> 02:42.905
One of the things that I wanted to at least touch on that affected my career a great deal, and of course I was picked up with John Hutchison, is that we were fiercely protective of the resources that came to Extension because we had studied the history of Extension.

02:43.526 --> 02:49.594
We knew that, see, you're familiar with the history there, that there were actually two Extension services back

02:49.642 --> 02:57.393
before the Extension Service was officially, USDA was doing some things, and the land-grant universities were doing, every state was kind of doing their own thing.

02:57.413 --> 03:02.881
And it began to be competitive, not rational, and so forth.

03:03.361 --> 03:15.238
And so there was a sentiment of somehow, as I call it, a shotgun marriage, to put them together, to make the Extension Service a part of the land-grant university, pick up that expertise, and then also tying it into the department, the U.S.

03:15.258 --> 03:19.564
Department of Agriculture, which is why it's called the Cooperative Extension Service.

03:19.544 --> 03:28.997
And at that time, there was a fierce concern, not a fierce concern, a significant concern on the part of congressional leaders

03:29.112 --> 03:39.063
based on experience that if you just simply gave the resources to the land-grant universities, they would wind up enhancing the instructional program.

03:39.083 --> 03:40.665
And that had happened over and over again.

03:41.106 --> 03:42.587
So the law is very specific.

03:42.688 --> 03:49.996
It says there shall be a specific and separate organization to, you know, do the work out in the state.

03:50.697 --> 03:56.183
And the funds, you know, were appropriated for the purpose of that and nothing else.

03:56.635 --> 04:06.568
The big, the early days of auditing, they were always trying to find some extension specialist teaching classes because that was a big no-no unless you had a split assignment.

04:06.588 --> 04:12.275
But we had a big complicated reporting system and, you know, you had to account for your time and so forth.

04:12.295 --> 04:18.863
And, you know, a lot of land grant, particularly people that haven't come up in the land grant system,

04:18.843 --> 04:24.049
I guess couldn't understand that because it all comes out of the same pot, you know, what does it matter?

04:24.209 --> 04:42.268
But, you know, we felt the history was such that the intent was to get it out into the field to help the farm people or the rural people or all people out in the state because they had other resources to do the instructional thing and they shouldn't be siphoned off to do research or extension.

04:43.189 --> 04:43.990
And I think

04:44.392 --> 05:00.898
that caused John problems, that caused me problems in terms of administering this because we had problems, for example, in many state other universities, there was a much greater use of what we call joint appointments

05:01.013 --> 05:15.668
Well, in Iowa, Missouri, places like that, that's not such a big problem because a specialist, if he has a teaching schedule, but a teaching schedule in Texas is not very compatible with a specialist position because, as I said, unless you went out for a week at a time, you wouldn't get accomplished much.

05:15.708 --> 05:20.053
You couldn't do much on just going out on Tuesdays or Thursdays or depending on your schedule.

05:20.073 --> 05:22.115
Anyway, we can, I guess we'll have to do some more of this.

05:22.175 --> 05:23.276
All right.

05:23.817 --> 05:26.920
We'll stop there.

05:26.900 --> 05:33.386
October, I mean November 17 and we're stopping now and we'll continue at a later date.

05:36.268 --> 05:39.291
This is now November 20 and we are continuing.

05:41.853 --> 05:46.938
During, Dr. Hudson was the director for 18 years?

05:48.059 --> 05:50.922
Between 18 and 19 years, the longest serving director ever.

05:50.942 --> 05:55.185
What were the major accomplishments of those years?

05:55.205 --> 05:56.907
Well, I would say

05:57.578 --> 06:01.092
Number one would be the development of the

06:02.320 --> 06:28.598
regional research and extension centers, where there were about 11 or 12 of these established, Amarillo, Lubbock, Dallas, Overton, you know, and getting those staffed with area specialists so that the assistance that farmers and agents needed was much more available than when we used to, before that time, had to work everything out of College Station, which meant a tremendous amount of travel and that type of thing.

06:28.738 --> 06:32.023
The other thing I think that was accomplished during that period

06:32.628 --> 06:37.034
And a very difficult time was the integration of the two extension services.

06:37.054 --> 06:42.121
You know, there was a black extension service emanating out of Prairie View.

06:43.923 --> 06:46.747
Because of the Civil Rights Acts, these had to be consolidated.

06:47.548 --> 06:52.915
Very difficult to do in some counties, as you might imagine, because they had to be housed together and share, I mean,

06:53.198 --> 06:55.043
They had to work across racial lines.

06:55.063 --> 06:57.368
It wasn't blacks just working with blacks and so forth.

06:59.273 --> 07:01.017
Very difficult to acquire.

07:01.499 --> 07:08.636
I think he did a great deal in terms of reaching or helping develop programs, part of which I was in there.

07:08.656 --> 07:11.022
I talked about the expanded foods and nutrition program.

07:11.390 --> 07:25.184
of getting new programs developed for trying to reach the limited income families, particularly with family living where they could make better use of what limited resources they had in terms of food, clothing, and shelter.

07:26.145 --> 07:30.529
Even some of the poorest families do not do a good job of managing what they have.

07:30.790 --> 07:37.897
And if you can teach them, you know, basic budgeting and setting aside money for things that are important and so forth.

07:37.937 --> 07:39.118
There was a lot done in here.

07:39.402 --> 07:49.998
We also started a thrust of doing more community development work instead of working more with individual farmers and so forth.

07:50.519 --> 07:56.027
We started to work with communities as a whole to help communities improve themselves.

07:56.007 --> 08:08.259
even to the extent where they help them organize, to attract, to develop activities, small industries, and so forth, to provide a place for the young people to stay.

08:08.320 --> 08:15.126
We find, all our studies have shown that young people, given their brothers, would rather stay home, but they have to have opportunities.

08:15.387 --> 08:24.616
And so we did a lot in terms of, or during his regime, did a lot to increase that.

08:24.636 --> 08:25.457
In fact, we

08:25.437 --> 08:35.136
Our traditional four program thrusts were agriculture, home economics, 4-H, and youth, and then we added during his administration what we call community resource development.

08:35.497 --> 08:42.912
Right now, the community development would be less rural and more urban, wouldn't it?

08:42.992 --> 08:44.014
Well, to some extent.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.399
I mean, we didn't try to...

08:47.493 --> 08:51.521
do a great deal in the larger urban areas, but I'm talking about county seat towns.

08:51.541 --> 08:52.362
That's right, yeah.

08:52.382 --> 09:00.979
You know, that would be classified as urban, you know, I think, what, anything over 2,500 is, and a lot of county seat towns are 5,000, 10,000, so forth.

09:00.999 --> 09:07.932
And, but do it on a, on some, more on an area basis, because we recognize that with modern transportation and so forth,

09:08.182 --> 09:26.680
people tended to group themselves into areas like you have the Brazos Valley and, you know, the surrounding area of Lubbock and so forth, that people tend to, you know, go certain places for medical service and so forth out of their locality, but you have a more trying to identify a viable unit to attract industry.

09:27.149 --> 09:48.523
We did a lot of work, particularly when we helped establish, Dr. Hudson was instrumental in helping establish the Recreation and Parks Department, which did a lot of things there in trying to get people to capitalize on the historic things they had and provide objective for tourists and so forth.

09:48.543 --> 09:52.870
On these two very important changes, about when did the integration begin?

09:53.390 --> 09:54.372
Well, let's see.

09:56.134 --> 10:05.490
Well, the civil rights big changes started in the late 60s with the Lyndon Johnson administration, and then they started filtering down, and we had to cope with those.

10:07.072 --> 10:16.748
And as it developed, I was right in the middle of this because I became associate director in 71,

10:18.483 --> 10:21.749
And this was right after, I think Mr. Rudder died in 70.

10:22.390 --> 10:25.655
Jack Williams, I think, succeeded him, didn't he?

10:26.837 --> 10:27.058
Yeah.

10:27.298 --> 10:32.948
And that was the period when we really had to get to grips, not only with the

10:33.721 --> 10:47.101
racial thing, racial segregation, but simultaneously there also came the thrust in terms of the women feeling that they are part of this.

10:47.121 --> 10:50.867
The end of the truth was they were paid less generally.

10:51.468 --> 10:53.451
Black agents were paid a lot less.

10:53.431 --> 10:56.817
than white agents.

10:56.837 --> 10:58.641
And women, generally, were paid less.

10:58.701 --> 10:59.843
Of course, there was some explanation.

10:59.883 --> 11:05.053
A lot of the women are in and out, more so, or stay a short time and leave and so forth.

11:05.073 --> 11:06.556
But there was discrimination.

11:06.796 --> 11:11.946
And shortly after I became associate director, Dr. Hutchison

11:14.474 --> 11:18.360
So he's still working on his PhD at that time.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.362
He had a major medical problem.

11:20.603 --> 11:27.252
He was one of the very first people to have open heart surgery when it was still pretty crude, one of those six, seven hour operations.

11:28.374 --> 11:31.338
And it really took a lot out of him.

11:31.418 --> 11:32.981
I mean, it took him a long time to recover.

11:33.001 --> 11:41.212
He never complained so much about his chest problems, but they took these long veins out of the legs and he got these horrible leg pains and everything.

11:41.773 --> 11:44.397
And he really, really suffered a lot.

11:44.917 --> 11:54.190
It was during that period that, you know, I had to step forward as associate director, the number two person, to deal a lot with this, particularly this integration thing.

11:54.511 --> 12:02.402
Give some examples of some of the real successes as well as some of the real difficulties.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.525
Well, I'm leading up to the real difficulty.

12:04.605 --> 12:06.047
About that time, one of our

12:06.719 --> 12:15.391
African-American agents brought suit, class action suit, against the Extension Service for past discrimination and so forth.

12:15.791 --> 12:20.598
And then somehow another women got included in the whole package.

12:20.618 --> 12:26.246
And it devolved on me and the personnel officer to really work with this.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.107
And we were

12:27.695 --> 12:35.307
trying to settle this case out of court with the support of Dr. Williams and others because obviously we didn't prefer not to go to court if we could work this out.

12:36.229 --> 12:53.297
So we spent untold hours, Dr. Black, who was the personnel officer who got really into the statistical aspects, and we spent weeks in Washington in the Justice Department negotiating this, and we struck the best deal we could.

12:54.593 --> 13:09.413
the ultimate thing was they wanted, you know, equal pay for everything else equal, but they didn't want to, they didn't have to say exactly, you know, you don't do it as a group as long as the, statistically now, as long as the factors that you are taking into account

13:09.730 --> 13:18.631
can explain the differences, such as tenure, such as experience, and we held out for performance, that if you could add performance in that, you could justify.

13:19.192 --> 13:25.647
And so we came up with a very elaborate scheme in terms of

13:28.327 --> 13:40.851
getting this done and as long as the group was, I mean all of the things being taken, but the facts were we had to give very significant increases to these other groups, I mean to the black agents and to the

13:41.388 --> 13:54.289
as a group, but most of that was done on a basis where we were able to get a performance review process that when that money went out, it went to the best people, the best performing people.

13:54.610 --> 13:57.394
And that brought their average, you know, so they were competitive.

13:57.735 --> 13:59.317
But that took a great deal of effort.

13:59.598 --> 14:01.000
When we went to Washington,

14:01.874 --> 14:11.867
We were weeks in conference room with the American Civil Liberties Union lawyers, and the lawyers on behalf of the people bringing the class action suit.

14:12.147 --> 14:15.451
But we did reach a settlement out of court, and it still stands to this day.

14:15.491 --> 14:19.957
And it was difficult, but we got through it on that basis.

14:19.977 --> 14:24.102
And as I said, because of Dr. Hutchison's health, I had to do a whole lot of this.

14:26.025 --> 14:31.071
As I said, I think the Extension Service expanded greatly under Dr. Hutchison's

14:31.439 --> 14:38.888
Tenure, I think we probably added I'd say three to four hundred new professional positions.

14:39.729 --> 14:51.022
Many of these were area specialists where we had at these various area locations we had anywhere from six to ten, twelve, fifteen area people in the various areas.

14:51.503 --> 15:00.754
We added staff here, new program areas, community resource development, family nutrition, foods and nutrition programs, community development programs.

15:01.038 --> 15:04.482
There was quite an expansion of staff here and there was some expansion at the county level.

15:05.444 --> 15:17.138
And so the organization grew greatly and I think, you know, made a significant contribution to the people of the state.

15:17.419 --> 15:20.162
Was anything phased out during those years?

15:22.665 --> 15:24.387
No, not that I can think of.

15:24.467 --> 15:25.729
I think it was just,

15:25.962 --> 15:41.197
I mean, we had a very strong base in agriculture, a very strong support from agricultural groups, and we had a constant struggle like groups like the Farm Bureau saw us mainly just as serving producers.

15:42.198 --> 15:45.542
And other things that we did, they thought took away from that.

15:45.642 --> 15:51.368
They did not like to see us working in urban areas or, you know, doing some of these social action programs, as they called it.

15:51.968 --> 15:52.729
And we had

15:52.709 --> 16:02.284
you know, a struggle both in the legislature and others because they constantly came back and said, you know, we don't mind you serving as other groups but don't take away resources from us.

16:02.805 --> 16:07.813
What were the other groups that you worked with most frequently?

16:08.354 --> 16:11.218
Well, the Farm Bureau was a very strong presence in Texas.

16:11.779 --> 16:16.647
The Grange was by then still existing but not a political factor.

16:16.707 --> 16:18.109
The Farmers Union was

16:18.511 --> 16:27.666
off in the other direction, but they tended more to, were more concerned with federal action.

16:27.686 --> 16:39.726
I mean, they did more on the federal level for getting like farm security, you know, the loan programs and some of the services that came out of other agencies in the department, they were more activist oriented.

16:40.367 --> 16:45.075
We always, you know, characterize our role as strictly as educational.

16:45.528 --> 16:50.836
One of the things we always did was never to let our people handle the funds.

16:52.218 --> 16:55.423
And if there were any funds, somebody locally would be put in charge of it.

16:55.703 --> 17:00.250
And probably that saved us a great deal of grief because, you know, when there's money, there's always temptation.

17:01.272 --> 17:04.937
And anyway, that was...

17:06.217 --> 17:23.329
I think as I said he was an outstanding director and you know he was my mentor in all of this and as I said the last two or three or four years of his tenure I had to a lot fell on me in terms of running the organization and taking care of some of these special problems.

17:24.311 --> 17:28.259
He spent a lot of time in terms of public relations work.

17:28.339 --> 17:28.900
He was

17:29.403 --> 17:34.008
on a first-name basis with all the governors of most of the leading legislators.

17:34.028 --> 17:47.483
He went to their funerals, he went to, you know, they often had these appreciation days for, he never missed those, you know, whether it was for a remote West Texas, and he was usually the only representative from Texas A&M that would participate in these.

17:47.543 --> 17:52.288
Now, some of the more, you know, important people, other university people would participate,

17:52.268 --> 18:01.137
He was known in Austin, I mean, there's no question about it, and he could go up and down the street or down the halls of the legislature, the Capitol, and everybody greeted him and so forth.

18:01.157 --> 18:08.244
Which of our local legislators during Dr. Hutchinson's time deserved the most credit for being supportive?

18:09.005 --> 18:12.669
Well, of course, on the national level, Olin Teague was very supportive.

18:12.729 --> 18:20.537
I mean, he was, in fact, I remember myself working with him, talking about

18:22.019 --> 18:38.073
You know, a few years later, as you're aware of, after we went through this agonizing process of integration of the services, then Congress came around and provided special funds to the 1890 institutions to do extension and research work, which tended to resegregate.

18:39.174 --> 18:41.957
And I had a visit with him in Washington one time.

18:42.017 --> 18:52.026
I said, you know, to me, this whole matter is we ought to, the objective ought to be to reach the point, when I'm dealing with you,

18:52.597 --> 18:54.201
I shouldn't even have to think about your color.

18:54.482 --> 18:55.585
I mean, you're just a person.

18:56.086 --> 18:57.389
I said, that's the ultimate objective.

18:57.410 --> 19:02.944
When you do the other thing, again, you're counting, you know, black people, audiences, and so forth.

19:02.964 --> 19:05.330
And he agreed with me thoroughly.

19:05.671 --> 19:09.120
He said, but Dan, if I or any other congressman

19:09.522 --> 19:12.726
You know, even hinted in this direction, we politically did.

19:13.186 --> 19:19.474
I mean, you know, you just had to go along with it or you wouldn't be a player, and I had to accept that, you know, and it's probably true.

19:19.975 --> 19:24.180
What about state legislate, our local state legislators who deserve the most credit?

19:24.220 --> 19:25.341
Well, run me by some names.

19:25.521 --> 19:27.804
They turned over pretty rapidly, but they were supportive.

19:27.824 --> 19:28.785
Bill Moore?

19:29.066 --> 19:30.688
Bill Moore was supportive.

19:30.768 --> 19:32.610
Bill was difficult to work with, but...

19:32.911 --> 19:38.298
When it came down to, you know, what, A&M always got, he represented A&M very well.

19:38.778 --> 19:44.185
I think he was more concerned with the university than with us as such, but, you know, we were part of the package.

19:44.205 --> 19:52.696
And help me remember the name of the house member who later was a Justice of Peace downtown.

19:52.716 --> 19:54.938
I don't know who you were saying.

19:54.998 --> 19:55.960
I can see his face.

19:56.180 --> 19:57.722
Went to the Bryan Presbyterian Church.

20:00.205 --> 20:00.746
Mm-hmm, yeah.

20:00.766 --> 20:01.146
Oh, boy.

20:01.126 --> 20:05.632
They turned over pretty rapidly.

20:07.274 --> 20:12.420
Who were the key state legislators in that time to get things done?

20:13.141 --> 20:14.844
Well, Gus Mucher.

20:14.864 --> 20:17.347
Gus Mucher was a big friend of the Extension Service.

20:17.627 --> 20:18.428
From Brenham?

20:18.448 --> 20:19.009
Yeah.

20:19.029 --> 20:22.273
He had been county judge there and he was, I guess,

20:23.620 --> 20:30.495
second, I'd say, maybe the most powerful person, but he, Dr. Hutchinson worked, had a good relationship with him.

20:31.297 --> 20:35.065
And he was usually, he was Speaker of the House, well, I guess,

20:35.618 --> 20:45.469
He was probably chairman of the Appropriations Committee, then became speaker, and when it came down to, as we would say, Licklog, he was there for extension service and for the university.

20:45.509 --> 20:49.573
And President Rudder and President Williams both supportive?

20:50.014 --> 20:50.995
Oh, yes.

20:51.015 --> 20:52.757
I'd say so, yeah.

20:52.877 --> 20:58.183
Rudder probably understood extension better, but he had, of course, he wanted to build up the university.

20:58.163 --> 21:03.290
Williams required a little education but he came along pretty well I think in terms of understanding.

21:03.410 --> 21:10.300
Were there, as you look back now, were there any opportunities we missed during those years?

21:11.141 --> 21:14.166
Were there any things we might have done, could have done, should have done?

21:15.568 --> 21:22.197
No, I guess one of the things we had going for us in those days was the general

21:23.037 --> 21:28.844
support that higher education was enjoying during the Connelly years, and I guess those were the top years.

21:28.864 --> 21:31.967
That was in the 60s, let's say.

21:31.987 --> 21:36.573
And Briscoe was agriculture, you know, that type of thing.

21:36.613 --> 21:41.158
Smith, even though he was from West Texas Lubbock, always was very supportive.

21:41.178 --> 21:45.723
And then there was the guy from Waco, the Democrat governor later on.

21:47.665 --> 21:50.108
He was in for, between Clements, I think, at four years.

21:52.214 --> 21:52.815
Baylor Mann.

21:53.276 --> 21:54.819
Yeah, yeah.

21:54.839 --> 21:55.781
Oh, boy.

21:55.801 --> 21:55.941
Okay.

21:56.462 --> 21:57.164
He was supportive.

21:57.224 --> 21:58.306
I mean, all of them.

21:58.326 --> 21:58.927
And Price Daniel?

21:59.749 --> 22:01.693
Well, that goes back a little further, doesn't it?

22:01.713 --> 22:01.813
Oh.

22:01.853 --> 22:04.278
No, it wasn't Price Daniel that I'm thinking about.

22:05.260 --> 22:07.945
Then Dr. Huston retires when?

22:09.578 --> 22:16.606
He retires in about 74-ish, 75-ish.

22:17.007 --> 22:17.788
Do you succeed him?

22:18.068 --> 22:18.349
No.

22:19.029 --> 22:22.594
Dr. Kunkel, Dean Kunkel, was named as acting director.

22:24.536 --> 22:32.906
But he totally depended on me to continue operating it as I had been under that.

22:33.687 --> 22:36.931
And he didn't ever move into the desk.

22:36.971 --> 22:38.573
He just had the title.

22:39.143 --> 22:44.174
And that brings me to, I guess, my appointment to director in 1976.

22:44.215 --> 22:57.625
As I had indicated earlier, and I guess I had gotten very imbued with this, there was a continuous struggle within the university, particularly within the College of Agriculture department heads who felt

22:58.364 --> 23:01.490
that they wanted a lot more control of the extension specialist.

23:02.291 --> 23:05.737
And up to that time, Dr. Hutchinson had been pretty successful in maintaining.

23:06.038 --> 23:06.659
We went along.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.783
At one time, they weren't even housed with the departments.

23:09.323 --> 23:16.957
Earlier, they went along with housing, which I think was a wonderful thing because, you know, if you're in horticulture, you know, it's a lot easier to communicate if you're in the same building and so forth.

23:16.977 --> 23:22.026
And if the extension person is out, it's, you know, you can get the research or the professor or somebody.

23:22.276 --> 23:48.283
you know help with questions and this type of thing and so there was a quite a struggle I won't name names but there were several department heads who not only you know wanted they wanted the budget so to speak I mean you know but as you know in your administrative position you ain't got nothing unless you got the budget control and they wanted simply to have a budget and then you know they would decide you know what how to allocate it in terms of extension specialists and

23:48.736 --> 23:59.651
Dr. Hutchinson was powerful enough to, I think, pretty well stop this, but that issue pretty much came to a head, I guess, with my appointment.

23:59.811 --> 24:06.621
A lot of, there was extreme support, from my viewpoint, from the field.

24:07.302 --> 24:11.127
I mean, people had seen how I'd come up and come through the ranks.

24:11.167 --> 24:14.191
You know, that's always, you know, people like to see that type of thing.

24:14.231 --> 24:16.414
I particularly had strong support

24:16.681 --> 24:23.011
from the home economic staff who always felt they were, expression I won't express, but sucking something else.

24:23.692 --> 24:38.115
And they saw me as somebody who recognized their significant role, because people don't realize we had 300 or 400 professional home economists, almost as many as in agriculture, and the youth people and some of these other people.

24:40.339 --> 24:43.684
But a number of the department heads under the leadership of one or two of them

24:44.339 --> 24:53.753
you know, really were pushing more to try to get a department head, which often happens, a department head becomes the head of the Extension Service Experiment Station, and it really got to be a struggle.

24:55.275 --> 25:04.168
So they had to, they appointed, and I really thought I wasn't going to get it because of the forces that were arrayed to the other side here at the university.

25:04.769 --> 25:07.393
They appointed a search committee, a large search committee,

25:08.200 --> 25:21.078
to go through this, as you know how they go, worked for six to eight months and they had, they publicly, it was at that time it became necessary to advertise all positions.

25:21.098 --> 25:28.108
They had 48 applications for the position, many from out of state, quite a few from in-state, some surprising ones from in-state.

25:28.989 --> 25:37.060
The committee deliberated, it was composed of both extension people, field people, as well as university people from other parts of the College of Agriculture and so forth.

25:37.394 --> 25:41.299
Anyway, they came down to eight names and said, this is why we can sift it down.

25:41.820 --> 25:43.762
Turned it over to the Board of Regents and said, this is it.

25:44.683 --> 25:47.187
And the forces were operating, I think, between the two camps.

25:47.707 --> 25:49.730
Dr. Kunkel took an absolutely neutral stance.

25:50.010 --> 25:52.093
He knew he saw the struggle.

25:53.014 --> 26:00.304
And the Board of Regents personally interviewed all eight, the top eight.

26:00.324 --> 26:02.406
They spent about an hour with each one, which is surprising.

26:02.446 --> 26:05.190
I mean, as much a responsibility as they had.

26:05.727 --> 26:11.794
And as I said, I wasn't particularly, you know, I was expecting a decision in the other direction.

26:12.515 --> 26:15.058
But we had a lot of friends among the Board of Regents.

26:15.459 --> 26:17.622
I think a particular one I'd have to point to is Lola Smith.

26:18.343 --> 26:19.063
You remember that name?

26:19.844 --> 26:20.365
Lola Smith.

26:21.046 --> 26:22.428
She was the first, one of the first women.

26:23.789 --> 26:24.790
I forget who pointed her.

26:25.271 --> 26:26.032
Smith probably did.

26:26.132 --> 26:26.473
I don't know.

26:26.973 --> 26:27.454
I can't remember.

26:27.474 --> 26:28.495
I'd have to look at the...

26:28.863 --> 26:35.550
But she was a homemaker from out in the Lubbock area and an extremely respected person.

26:36.353 --> 26:37.759
The women

26:38.313 --> 26:43.539
that homemakers out in the counties are organized into home demonstration.

26:43.559 --> 26:45.220
They were called home economics clubs.

26:45.541 --> 26:49.465
They have a county group, and they had a state group, and she became president of the state group.

26:49.485 --> 26:57.193
And she was very much interested in the home economics programs and so forth, and to this day, I feel she played a role in my selection.

26:57.894 --> 27:01.618
But anyway, after they interviewed all eight people, I was named director.

27:02.419 --> 27:07.965
As you recall the actual interview with the board, what seemed to be their deepest interests, their greatest concerns?

27:09.093 --> 27:12.538
Well, you've been through that.

27:13.359 --> 27:16.023
It's hard to remember because you're very tense.

27:16.263 --> 27:20.849
It's an extremely emotional or tense, stressful period.

27:20.870 --> 27:21.911
But they spent about an hour.

27:22.011 --> 27:24.915
But I think it had to do with future directions of the Extension Service.

27:25.216 --> 27:28.200
They didn't ask you any one-of-a-kind questions?

27:28.420 --> 27:29.221
No, I don't think so.

27:30.122 --> 27:31.985
But they interviewed all eight people.

27:32.826 --> 27:38.374
And about an hour after the interviews were completed, Conkel called me in and said, you're it.

27:39.046 --> 27:45.032
Did anybody give you any clear directions, marching orders?

27:45.052 --> 27:46.954
No, not particularly.

27:46.974 --> 27:51.238
And you at that time were to report to, as the new director, you were to report?

27:51.258 --> 27:53.981
At that time it was Conkle.

27:54.982 --> 28:04.932
Conkle was dean and at that time under Jack Williams administration extension service was under, as part of the College of Agriculture.

28:05.472 --> 28:08.395
Harry Conkle was dean of agriculture.

28:08.797 --> 28:17.748
And he had three major subordinates, the experiment station head, director of the experiment station, and then there was an associate dean, Dr. Potts, remember that name?

28:17.868 --> 28:18.128
R.C.

28:18.148 --> 28:18.549
Potts?

28:18.569 --> 28:20.251
Yeah, who was over the academics.

28:20.271 --> 28:22.153
So Harry Kunkel was the person I reported to.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.315
Who was the experiment station director then?

28:24.416 --> 28:24.936
Neville Clark.

28:25.056 --> 28:25.557
Neville.

28:25.577 --> 28:27.279
Yeah, Neville Clark.

28:27.299 --> 28:29.882
And Potts was the other person.

28:30.863 --> 28:36.610
And I am a great admirer of Harry Kunkel.

28:36.978 --> 28:50.034
as far as I was concerned, very supportive, administratively helpful, and didn't pretend that he knew all the details of extension service, so that, you know, he left that pretty well up to me, and we worked well together.

28:50.234 --> 28:57.163
But that changed rather abruptly about a year later when the other forces, at my disappointment, when

28:59.692 --> 29:01.335
Jarvis Miller became president.

29:02.637 --> 29:18.426
He had, he was extremely angry or had always been angry with Dr. Kunkel because he had spent three, two or four years working in the Dominican Republic and came back and the department didn't wish to have him back and

29:19.891 --> 29:25.880
And Dr. Kunkel made him assistant director of the experiment station or something because they didn't want him back in the department.

29:25.900 --> 29:34.172
But anyway, Jarvis was a skillful politician and got himself named president and, you know, very hurtful to the Williams family, as you know.

29:34.192 --> 29:34.954
Yes, yes.

29:34.974 --> 29:46.150
And what he immediately did was take the extension service and the experiment station away from Dr. Kunkel, which was extremely painful to Dr. Kunkel because he prided himself with, you know, having the three coordinates.

29:46.771 --> 29:47.873
And Dr. Kunkel

29:49.068 --> 29:58.810
And I and Edward Clark were set up in a new administrative unit, had a vice chancellor for agriculture, Harry Atkinson, and O.D.

29:58.830 --> 30:01.536
Butler was the assistant or associate vice chancellor.

30:01.556 --> 30:07.971
And they had got grandiose new offices in the administration building, and I no longer reported to Harry Kunkel, and I reported to

30:07.951 --> 30:14.203
to Dr. Atkinson, and we were, uh, that was the channel.

30:14.223 --> 30:16.888
And he reported not to the campus, but to the Chancellor.

30:16.908 --> 30:17.590
To the Chancellor.

30:17.650 --> 30:19.734
Chancellor, who, I guess it was Jack Williams.

30:19.754 --> 30:21.317
No, he had, I guess it was a two-way, no.

30:21.598 --> 30:22.199
It was Williams.

30:22.219 --> 30:25.585
Well, we were, I guess, we were still considered part of the university.

30:25.686 --> 30:25.926
Oh.

30:26.648 --> 30:27.350
No, I guess not.

30:27.932 --> 30:28.533
No, we weren't.

30:28.573 --> 30:34.249
Because Dr. Miller, one of his great campaigns was to have those report to him.

30:34.309 --> 30:34.911
Right, right, right.

30:35.111 --> 30:36.495
That was right.

30:36.575 --> 30:41.248
And the forces that I said that were very interested in having

30:41.617 --> 30:49.244
The department heads play a larger role in extension, were very supportive of Dr. Miller, and he was supportive of them.

30:50.205 --> 30:56.550
As I said, this became evident when the difficulty started with my leaving six years later.

30:59.272 --> 31:02.595
When the position became vacant then, there was no search committee.

31:02.615 --> 31:05.638
There was an immediate appointment of Dr. Carpenter, who had been a department head.

31:06.078 --> 31:08.060
That kind of gives you an indication there.

31:08.320 --> 31:08.521
All right.

31:09.181 --> 31:09.481
You got it?

31:09.561 --> 31:11.303
No, I just want to.

31:18.995 --> 31:29.818
As you began your period as the director this is 1976 what were your goals?

31:31.381 --> 31:39.298
Well I guess one of the problems I had opportunities I saw both the training you know
