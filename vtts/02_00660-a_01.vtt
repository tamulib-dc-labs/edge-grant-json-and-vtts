WEBVTT

00:01.617 --> 00:02.558
The meter begins to kick in. It means we've begun to 
record. It's essentially identification by

00:04.160 --> 00:05.762
name. Identification by name and your 
affiliation with Woods Hole. Okay. It's your

00:12.950 --> 00:15.593
turn. I'm H. Burr Steinbach. Henry is the name, 
part of the first initial. Henry Burr Steinbach,

00:21.280 --> 00:23.502
commonly known as Burr. I have been associated 
with Woods Hole Oceanographic and with

00:24.463 --> 00:30.190
oceanography. really for only about six or eight 
years. I became the first dean of the graduate

00:34.151 --> 00:43.685
school of oceanography, and following after six 
months in which K.O. Emery really set the thing up

00:43.745 --> 00:46.168
in good shape. That's been my primary experience, 
except for a whole series of committees.

00:53.419 --> 00:56.083
What was your early academic training? Early 
academic training was essentially basic biology

00:56.103 --> 01:00.649
and general physiology. And where did you go to 
school? Undergraduate at Michigan, master's

01:03.606 --> 01:13.478
degree at Brown University, Ph.D. at the 
University of Pennsylvania, and a couple years of

01:03.606 --> 01:13.478
post-doc work.

01:15.341 --> 01:18.825
Somehow I have you identified more with medical 
school, in my mind. Is that incorrect?

01:22.347 --> 01:26.494
Professional jobs have always been with 
departments of biology and zoology. But I've been

01:27.195 --> 01:31.923
closely affiliated with medical schools and 
taught in medical schools during the war. A field

01:33.465 --> 01:35.629
of teaching there was physiology. In my 
professional field, it would be called

01:36.089 --> 01:38.433
biophysics. And biophysics. And how did you 
develop an interest in oceanography or becoming

01:44.122 --> 01:47.528
dean of Woods Hole? partly because I've been 
associated with the Woodsville community since

01:49.229 --> 02:01.721
1929, which is a long time away, and witnessed the 
growth of the oceanography here. And then some

02:02.582 --> 02:14.494
years ago, dates I'd have to get you from the 
record, some years ago it was decided that it was

02:02.582 --> 02:14.494
necessary in the old interagency committee on 
oceanography to have some general biologists

02:15.082 --> 02:20.109
associated with it. So I became a member of the 
advisory committee for the old ICO.

02:31.945 --> 02:33.307
How were you chosen for the ICO? As you know, the way 
in which one gets into these things. I had been I'd

02:42.048 --> 02:51.921
been mixed up with the medical field on the 
National Heart Council, and then I also was

02:42.048 --> 02:51.921
chairman of the Division of Biology and 
Agriculture of the National Research Council.

02:53.002 --> 02:59.912
And that, in turn, led me to association with the 
conferences that the National Academy would have

02:53.002 --> 02:59.912
up here at Woods Hole. And being involved in those 
conferences, I got rather well acquainted with

03:00.572 --> 03:10.165
such people as Jim Wakeland, who at that time was 
Assistant Secretary of the Navy. and Edward Wink,

03:10.786 --> 03:18.536
who became very firmly involved, of course, in the 
development of governmental support of

03:10.786 --> 03:18.536
oceanography. So it's another one of those 
instances that is your personal acquaintances

03:19.237 --> 03:27.448
and development of interest in the field by 
association with these people. Were you happy

03:28.509 --> 03:30.231
with the functioning of ICO? Very much so. I think 
they did a great deal of good at that time. even

03:38.495 --> 03:42.780
though it didn't lead to any of the legislation 
that we would occasionally recommend.

03:47.166 --> 03:50.110
What seemed to be the breakdown between the ICO and 
legislation?

03:52.613 --> 04:06.510
Well, the structure of the ICO really was the 
assigned leadership of the various branches of

03:52.613 --> 04:06.510
the government, and they had no power.

04:08.785 --> 04:16.155
In other words, there'd be meetings, there'd be 
recommendations, it would be a device for all of

04:08.785 --> 04:16.155
the different agencies to know what was going on. 
But each agency still did as it pleased, so that it

04:16.435 --> 04:24.346
had no basic structure other than that of 
information and advisory. But I think it had a very

04:24.786 --> 04:27.290
good influence in that effect. With whom did you 
serve on the ICO?

04:33.718 --> 04:36.302
Let me rephrase the question, please. Was there 
anyone with whom you were particularly impressed

04:39.008 --> 04:40.670
with in serving on the ICO? Well, yes, indeed, they 
had some remarkable oceanographers. Morris

04:45.358 --> 04:47.621
Ewing, for example, was on that. That's where I got 
well acquainted with Morris Ewing. Brackett

04:50.385 --> 04:53.410
Hersey from here was a member of it. Hank Arnold, 
who is now running the State Department of

04:53.430 --> 04:56.995
Science. And the things, they were quite a series 
of people, extraordinarily able people, as you

04:58.457 --> 05:05.067
might say. which always gave me a feeling of slight 
bemusement because here I was, essentially a

05:05.333 --> 05:17.408
medical biophysicist operating with these 
characters who really were the basis for modern

05:05.333 --> 05:17.408
oceanography. What was Morris Ewing like in 
committee assignments?

05:24.097 --> 05:34.750
Very intelligent, very innovative, and very, you 
might say, very personal in the sense that he

05:24.097 --> 05:34.750
didn't want anyone else to run him. I still 
remember him getting up at one of the meetings and

05:35.776 --> 05:44.470
essentially saying, why doesn't the damn Navy 
support our boat and keep their fingers off the

05:35.776 --> 05:44.470
boat? We know how to run it. Morris was one of the 
great people of oceanography. There's just no

05:49.558 --> 05:50.660
doubt about it. But he was absolutely devoted to 
going ahead and doing what he, with his large quota

05:56.836 --> 06:00.719
of friends decided were the proper things to do in 
oceanography. He had a great influence on the

06:01.080 --> 06:04.002
development of oceanography. But as a committee 
member, he was also great because you could always

06:04.543 --> 06:09.207
rely on him to express his opinion. Were there any 
particular recommendations coming out of ICO

06:10.948 --> 06:17.054
which you supported strongly, which were not 
developed?

06:20.277 --> 06:21.618
It's a little hard to remember. That was quite some 
years ago. We did put in a very strong plug for the

06:27.329 --> 06:54.872
assumption by the government of the total costs of 
oceanographic surveys because many of the

06:27.329 --> 06:54.872
oceanographers of course are working on specific 
problems the contours of the bottom of the ocean or

06:27.329 --> 06:54.872
the effects of the currents or the distribution of 
the benthic organisms and things like that And

06:55.190 --> 07:00.117
they're somewhat less interested in taking 
worldwide surveys of the total oceans. And at that

07:00.557 --> 07:10.671
time, there was no such thing as the DOE in the, 
well, it was before the

07:00.557 --> 07:10.671
geophysical year, whatever it was called. I 
forgot. International geophysical year. So it

07:13.035 --> 07:23.509
seemed highly important that there be a 
concentrated effort for the federal government

07:13.035 --> 07:23.509
to take over the responsibility of making sure 
that there were these ocean-wide surveys. Now,

07:24.333 --> 07:27.276
that was not acted upon at that time. But as you 
know, there had been a series of developments,

07:27.337 --> 07:34.585
mostly, well, some national, quite a few of them 
international. And how much those developments

07:35.807 --> 07:43.776
stemmed from the discussions and 
recommendations of ICO would be very hard to

07:35.807 --> 07:43.776
define. But the recommendations were there, and 
they probably had an influence. After your

07:49.383 --> 07:53.968
service on the committee, then what did you do? 
Well, I was briefly on the NASCO committee, but I

07:54.151 --> 08:01.741
resigned from that. Actually, that overlapped 
with ICO, and I resigned from that because I went in

08:01.781 --> 08:06.848
and informed them. I thought there was a little 
conflict of interest there because they were

08:06.868 --> 08:15.539
criticizing the ICO operations, and I was being an 
ardent supporter of ICO. Then at the time when the

08:16.741 --> 08:23.550
Council on Marine Science and Development that 
was the government equivalent of the Stratton

08:24.442 --> 08:28.086
Commission. And Ed Wink was in charge of that. So he 
brought me in as consultant on that for two or three

08:32.150 --> 08:37.696
years. That was also a very exciting thing because 
Ed Wink was also quite a personality, as you

08:38.417 --> 08:46.726
probably know in case you've interviewed him. And 
then also at just about that time, Sea Grant

08:55.407 --> 08:57.029
program was started. And since I had worked very 
closely with Bob Abel on the old ICO thing, and also

08:58.470 --> 09:13.327
had been an assistant director of the National 
Science Foundation, a few things like that, I

08:58.470 --> 09:13.327
became one of the first members of the Sea Grant 
Advisory Program. So there's a continuity. I have

09:15.930 --> 09:17.231
several questions.

09:21.496 --> 09:24.199
Probably working backwards. In working with 
Wink, what exactly were you trying to do? Well, the

09:30.127 --> 09:38.682
Council had the overall responsibility for the 
coordination and development of all marine

09:30.127 --> 09:38.682
sciences. So that what we would do, we would have, 
among other things, a series of committee

09:40.104 --> 09:47.537
meetings to... put out the annual reports that 
were necessary and were required. And, of course,

09:54.746 --> 10:07.011
those reports, I don't know, you can never tell how 
much influence they had, but after all, the

09:54.746 --> 10:07.011
chairman of this council was by... By law, the vice 
president of the United States, and Humphrey at

10:07.615 --> 10:14.101
that time, was extraordinarily interested in 
marine sciences. So the main thing that we did,

10:15.323 --> 10:28.836
that his advisory group did, was to put together 
the progress for a given year to provide the

10:15.323 --> 10:28.836
material to write the report. And as a matter of 
fact, I was involved with Ed frequently the final

10:33.873 --> 10:38.378
hectic moments when you had to get the damn report 
out. So that's it. And you'll find the reports, of

10:40.721 --> 10:45.786
course, have been written, and you'll see their 
recommendations. And this is all being done

10:46.567 --> 10:56.598
parallel with, I might say, the NASCO committee 
reports and several other National Academy of

10:46.567 --> 10:56.598
Sciences reports and a follow-on from the ICO. 
There's a continuity between them.

11:01.598 --> 11:07.185
Did you feel as if when Humphrey left, that sort of 
the drive for oceanography left with him? Oh,

11:07.846 --> 11:10.749
Christ, not only left, it disappeared. I wasn't at 
the meeting, but because the advisory committee

11:10.789 --> 11:18.719
meeting did not meet with the council. They were 
advisory to the director of the thing. But the

11:23.926 --> 11:28.872
story is that when Agnew came into office, that he 
attended one meeting, part of it, and left and came

11:29.847 --> 11:37.074
back the second meeting and stayed five minutes 
and got up and said, sorry, gentlemen, I'm

11:29.847 --> 11:37.074
interested in space. And bang! Shortly after 
that, the council did expire.

11:49.427 --> 11:49.927
Sea Grant. Now, second question. When did you 
become interested in the idea of Sea Grant? When

11:55.192 --> 11:56.133
did you first hear about it? Well, I've been fairly 
close associated with Athol Spilhaus, you see.

12:00.879 --> 12:08.609
Because I taught at Minnesota when Athol was dean 
of the technology out there. And you don't be

12:09.751 --> 12:16.799
associated with Athol Spilhaus without knowing 
an awful lot of things that he's thinking about. So

12:16.819 --> 12:21.766
that I would say practically from when he first 
invented the term. And liked the idea very much, I

12:23.468 --> 12:26.972
might say. You liked the idea? Oh, yes. What was 
Spilhaus like to work for? There have been some

12:33.524 --> 12:36.248
criticisms of him as dean in Minnesota.

12:41.856 --> 12:46.102
That would require another whole book to write 
about Raphael Spilhaus. He's a most remarkable

12:46.122 --> 12:48.705
person. He has an ability to define objectives. 
And he also has the ability to point fingers at

12:53.092 --> 12:59.441
people and say, get ahead, go do it. So that some of 
the, I suspect that some of the flack at Minnesota

12:59.461 --> 13:12.059
was primarily because he was not one to just sit 
behind a desk and be an orderly operator. He is a man

13:12.961 --> 13:19.470
of ideas, he develops ideas, and he does have a 
considerable ability to get people to go do the

13:12.961 --> 13:19.470
work for him.

13:22.893 --> 13:34.091
Oh yes, I'm sure you couldn't possibly work with, 
Spilhaus couldn't possibly work in an

13:22.893 --> 13:34.091
institution not to get some criticism, but the 
praise would exceed it with criticism. When

13:35.573 --> 13:40.962
Spilhaus first begins to talk to you about Sea 
Grant, you remember what terms he phrased it? Did

13:41.002 --> 13:43.486
he attach it immediately to land-grant colleges? 
He did it by comparison. That was I wouldn't want to

13:50.095 --> 14:09.554
say that that's what stimulated his thinking on 
it, but being a good political thinker, I think he

13:50.095 --> 14:09.554
realized that a handle that would be recognized by 
people, including the legislators, would be this

13:50.095 --> 14:09.554
comparison with a land grant. You have a land 
grant, so okay, damn it, let's have a sea grant,

14:10.976 --> 14:14.740
which is just important. I suspect that was the 
reasoning.

14:21.635 --> 14:28.163
The use of the term Sea Grant program was almost 
certainly suggested by the existence of land

14:21.635 --> 14:28.163
grant. But I don't think that it was the, I might 
say, the success or an existence of land grant that

14:28.743 --> 14:43.121
led into the concept that we ought to really start 
developing programs for the proper and effective

14:28.743 --> 14:43.121
utilization of marine resources.

14:45.744 --> 14:50.950
Now, when you first began to be associated with Sea 
Grant, what were the problems involved in

14:51.503 --> 14:54.927
originating Sea Grant and picking Sea Grant 
institutions? Well,

14:56.209 --> 15:08.184
the problems involved were, they rested upon the, 
a little bit on the Land Grant Association, that

14:56.209 --> 15:08.184
you would make use of academic institutions. And 
since the philosophy of Sea Grant, in the same way

15:09.806 --> 15:20.920
that Land Grant is, that this be a system in which 
you really try to improve the utilization of

15:21.338 --> 15:22.019
something. In other words, it becomes what some 
people call applied science. And introducing

15:28.085 --> 15:49.388
that into departments of biology or departments 
of chemistry or departments of whatever in the

15:28.085 --> 15:49.388
academic institution is extraordinarily 
difficult, because they are convinced that their

15:28.085 --> 15:49.388
main function in life is to follow what they then 
consider the basic problems in a particular

15:28.085 --> 15:49.388
field. And Sea Grant is pretty pervasive. If you 
make use of the total resources of the oceans, you

15:53.170 --> 16:05.305
can't just be a biologist, or you can't just be a 
chemist, or you can't be what else. You have to be

16:05.365 --> 16:11.753
what ecology ought to be, but this wasn't at that 
time. You have to be a little of everything. In

16:14.216 --> 16:19.122
other words, you have to be able to define rather 
broad problems that lead to a practical usage

16:14.216 --> 16:19.122
right away.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.689
You're associated almost immediately with Bob 
Abel, I take it. Oh, yes. And I had been associated.

16:28.970 --> 16:32.615
See, he was the ICO when I was working there. Ed Link 
was with the PSAC.

16:39.724 --> 16:46.854
Jim Wakeland,

16:39.724 --> 16:46.854
as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, was in charge 
of ICO. And Bob Abel, being with the Navy at that

16:47.975 --> 16:53.783
time, was essentially the director for Wakeland. 
That is, Wakeland's appointee as director of Sea

16:57.771 --> 17:01.456
Grant. So I worked with Bob Abel. I'd worked with 
him for quite some time. He's with us now at A&M.

17:08.625 --> 17:13.551
Don't I know

17:08.625 --> 17:13.551
it. I take it you found him efficient and those 
sorts of things which make a good administrator?

17:19.017 --> 17:19.438
Oh, very. He also had a remarkable knack of finding 
some excellent people to work with him. And the Sea

17:24.610 --> 17:28.294
Grant staff is pretty remarkable in that respect.

17:31.177 --> 17:36.503
When you first begin to designate Sea Grant 
colleges, how do you go about designating them?

17:36.523 --> 17:43.010
Well, the first thing that, of course, it became 
known that there was Sea Grant money and various

17:36.523 --> 17:43.010
colleges put in. And that's where the first 
successful Sea Grant program really was the

17:43.030 --> 17:52.500
Oregon State University. For some reason or 
other, Sorry, I can't remember the name of the guy.

17:57.259 --> 17:57.720
Wayne Burke? Hmm? Wayne Burke? I don't think Wayne 
Burke. There are a couple of people out there who

18:02.666 --> 18:07.652
grasp the concept right away on the thing. But with 
most of the other schools that we first started

18:08.553 --> 18:19.407
doing things with, it was a very hard job to get them 
to agree to the concept of Sea Grant. And the way in

18:20.517 --> 18:29.410
which that was done was not only that Bob Abel and 
his staff were excluding Abel people, but they

18:20.517 --> 18:29.410
also used their advisory committee. They'd go out 
and have meetings at the end of the advisory

18:30.312 --> 18:33.456
committee. Bob Abel and usually two or three of the 
advisory committee would go up and talk with the

18:34.318 --> 18:49.140
boss man of the university and once in a while have 
to pound the table and say, either you can persuade

18:34.318 --> 18:49.140
your departmental people to agree to this 
concept, or you better not even try to get into Sea

18:49.981 --> 18:53.907
Grant.

18:57.113 --> 19:05.827
I would say that the first five years, there was one 
really of educating the academic institutions to

18:57.113 --> 19:05.827
subscribe to the concept of Sea Grant. And of 
course, John Calhoun was very early in that. And he

19:10.174 --> 19:14.100
was also one of the first members of the Sea Grant 
Advisory Program. But then he resigned when he

19:17.268 --> 19:22.175
when it was quite clear that A&M was going to be a 
leader in Sea Grant, too. But he's been very

19:23.017 --> 19:28.986
influential in general advisory work, too. Have 
you been satisfied with the outcome of Sea Grant?

19:36.117 --> 19:36.477
Yes. For the first 10-year development, I think it 
was excellent. I think that the next 10 years is...

19:44.842 --> 19:54.055
It's really, in a sense, more challenging, and 
that is to how to meld it together into much more of a

19:44.842 --> 19:54.055
national program. You've got the parts now. You 
have the various units of a program. Now to define

20:00.245 --> 20:07.816
more nearly some of the national objectives and to 
get a more concerted effort on those.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.182
After Sea Grant, then what? After Sea Grant, what 
do you mean after Sea Grant? What did you do next?

20:22.985 --> 20:28.671
Oh, of course they just kicked me off the Sea Grant 
Advisory Panel. Coincidence with that, I got to

20:28.731 --> 20:34.697
retirement age at the University of Chicago. So I 
moved here to Woods Hole and became a president and

20:40.782 --> 20:46.368
director of MBL on a sort of an interim basis 
because I was getting a little too old to do that.

20:47.649 --> 20:51.573
But there was an overlap of time here. In other 
words, I had revamped the Department of Chicago

20:52.574 --> 21:06.148
and brought in zoology and botany together in 
biology, which was a good time for me to get out of

20:52.574 --> 21:06.148
the chairmanship there. So rather than waiting to 
age 65, I guess I was 63, I came here then to take over

21:06.922 --> 21:15.651
running a marine biological laboratory. But they 
also have a stipulation that at age 65 you retire.

21:21.457 --> 21:30.186
So after the two and, well, three years of running 
it, really, we were developing the graduate

21:21.457 --> 21:30.186
program at Woods Hole Oceanographic. And I was 
very interested in that. because it's part of

21:34.327 --> 21:35.869
Woods Hole life. And I'm not institution-minded, 
should we say. I love Woods Hole as a basic

21:39.934 --> 21:42.016
community. So when they were having great 
difficulty in finding a professional

21:42.917 --> 22:01.279
oceanographer who would sort of run a chance on 
trying to put together a graduate school, and with

21:42.917 --> 22:01.279
a general academic background, they finally, we 
finally reached an agreement, okay, I'd start the

21:42.917 --> 22:01.279
graduate school up there. So that's sort of the 
sequence of things overlapping. First,

22:05.759 --> 22:14.191
working with the lab, did you go to the lab with any 
preconceived ideas of what you wanted to do? Which

22:14.891 --> 22:15.612
lab? The MBL. Well, it's been a major source of my 
research work, of course. Well, to pick an

22:26.420 --> 22:37.291
example, I was one of the first ones to start using 
the giant squid axon as a device for really medical

22:26.420 --> 22:37.291
physiology and things like that. And that's been 
mostly my existence there. So to say the

22:43.178 --> 22:53.028
involvement with the administrative end of 
things and the overall planning of things didn't

22:43.178 --> 22:53.028
take place until about age 55. Before that, I 
really was an academic. laboratory type, you

22:56.018 --> 22:57.880
might say.

23:02.184 --> 23:06.469
You worked with the squid, though, for G, you know, 
I guess 20 years almost, didn't you? No, not that

23:07.870 --> 23:24.287
long, because my interest was really, say, 
biophysics, and had to do with particularly

23:07.870 --> 23:24.287
electrolyte transfer between cells in the 
environment. So it's quite a spread of materials

23:24.959 --> 23:36.629
that I used, ranging pretty much from frog skin, 
muscle tissue, some kidney work, things like

23:24.959 --> 23:36.629
that. So at that time, I was being a very good 
academic. In other words, you have an objective

23:42.374 --> 23:46.418
and use the material that's best. And squid 
nerves, of course, turned out to be one of the most

23:46.498 --> 23:54.865
remarkable findings.

23:55.486 --> 24:01.532
You didn't carry out any major reorganization of 
the lab when you arrived? At the MBL? Yeah, at the

24:02.232 --> 24:02.913
MBL. No, except that while I was there, we did start 
some of the year-round programs. You see, the MBL

24:12.282 --> 24:17.046
had always been really primarily a summer 
program. It became perfectly clear that one

24:17.767 --> 24:24.733
needed to get more year-round programs going for 
for a very practical reason, and that is that

24:25.253 --> 24:39.151
people would come to, we'd ask foundations for 
support, and they'd come and look at all those nice

24:25.253 --> 24:39.151
buildings there and find them used only four 
months out of the year, and they'd just get into all

24:25.253 --> 24:39.151
sorts of tizzies. So for a purely practical 
reason, it became necessary to try to begin to

24:39.992 --> 24:51.528
bring more outside things in, which my successor, 
Jim Ebert, has been remarkably successful at

24:39.992 --> 24:51.528
doing. But during the... During the three or four 
years in which I was director of the NBL, we did

24:55.544 --> 25:01.432
start that year-round program. How did you aim for 
a year-round program? What sort of changes did you

25:05.157 --> 25:08.261
make to create one? No changes, in effect. It's 
primarily a matter of finding ways to do it, which

25:10.605 --> 25:14.210
means money.

25:17.013 --> 25:22.581
That just had to do with interesting various 
units. One of the main things that we started then

25:23.827 --> 25:28.472
was this Boston University program, which is 
working very well.

25:32.777 --> 25:39.325
In a sense, that wasn't so much a matter of money as 
it was getting some very good people working here

25:32.777 --> 25:39.325
year-round who could pay for themselves. And how 
did you solicit them?

25:45.952 --> 25:51.298
Again, that has a rather odd history. At the time 
that I was the assistant director of the Science

25:54.657 --> 25:56.920
Foundation. This goes way back to, what, 53. And 
then following that, I was chairman of the

26:01.064 --> 26:04.348
divisional committee. And at that time, some of 
the people at Boston University wanted to start

26:04.568 --> 26:11.676
their own marine laboratory. And the problems of 
financing to really establish a proper marine

26:13.418 --> 26:22.268
laboratory were not very good. During the various 
discussions, which lasted over several years,

26:23.193 --> 26:40.895
you see, really quite a few years, I became 
acquainted with some of the people at Boston

26:23.193 --> 26:40.895
University, and we finally arrived at the 
conclusion that the sensible thing, if they

26:23.193 --> 26:40.895
wanted a marine sciences program, would be to 
utilize an existing facility. That's roughly the

26:42.257 --> 26:44.720
way in which it developed. Okay. And so then when 
you become director, I suppose you... Didn't make

26:51.087 --> 26:53.269
overtures to them to use the facilities? Yes, it

26:54.771 --> 27:08.744
was one of those things that,

26:54.771 --> 27:08.744
again, I'm trying to remember the name of the man 
mainly involved who left and is now down in South

26:54.771 --> 27:08.744
Carolina. It was mainly a thing that we'd been 
having discussions all along. And prior to that,

27:13.449 --> 27:20.436
there was no really easy administrative link at 
which you could do the planning. But when I came

27:21.715 --> 27:31.367
into the office and already had the contacts with 
Boston University, it wasn't a matter of anyone

27:21.715 --> 27:31.367
making overtures. It was a matter of just saying, 
ha, goddammit, now we can get going.

27:38.076 --> 27:40.018
So then you just began to move? Yeah. All right. And 
some very interesting administrative

27:41.577 --> 27:45.721
discussions, I might say.

27:48.644 --> 27:55.371
But it led to the formation of, I think, a very good 
program now, which also made it much easier. The

27:56.092 --> 28:00.116
existence of that made it much easier to get the 
other year-round programs started. You have to

28:00.676 --> 28:02.578
have a nugget to start with, you see.

28:06.562 --> 28:11.027
And it's while you're there, is this when you begin 
to make formal contact with now The Woods Hole

28:11.395 --> 28:12.476
staff? No, I'd really known a fairish number of 
them for quite some time. Woods Hole is that sort of

28:22.128 --> 28:25.973
a community, even though the institutions are 
separate. On the scientific staff basis, no one

28:26.914 --> 28:32.781
makes any separations. Depends on your interest 
in science. So the answer is, no, I'd known them

28:35.945 --> 28:38.989
quite a bit. And then, of course, when I became 
director and became more closely associated with

28:39.374 --> 28:57.210
Paul Fye, it was,

28:39.374 --> 28:57.210
well, we agreed upon something which is 
extraordinarily important and still is, and that

28:39.374 --> 28:57.210
is that Woods Hole is a total scientific 
community. And you do have to make sure that even

28:58.391 --> 29:08.740
though the separate institutions retain their 
individual integrity, that nevertheless they do

28:58.391 --> 29:08.740
not act competitively. have to act 
cooperatively. So Paul and I agreed on that very

29:12.215 --> 29:15.298
thoroughly.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.442
And that led to quite a close association.

29:23.265 --> 29:30.811
And when then do you think about becoming director 
or dean over here at Woods Hole? I was involved in

29:30.831 --> 29:32.433
the search committee. Oh, okay. And it really was 
one of those cases

29:40.040 --> 29:56.236
It would be very hard to get a top-level 
prestigious oceanographer to come in and

29:40.040 --> 29:56.236
run a chance on cutting down his own scientific 
productivity to start up something new like that,

29:40.040 --> 29:56.236
you see. So that I don't remember, and I wouldn't 
mention anyway, the people, we had two or three

29:57.597 --> 30:07.347
people that we really tried to put the bee on. But if 
you're mixed up in academia, you'll know that if

30:08.609 --> 30:21.389
there's a position open and you track a couple 
people, then if you go much further than that, the

30:08.609 --> 30:21.389
prestige of the job sort of goes down. It's pretty 
clear, and this is my reasoning really, because as

30:21.850 --> 30:29.942
I pointed out to the rest of the search committee, I 
had no experience in either oceanography or being

30:30.749 --> 30:35.235
a dean or anything else, so what the hell. But then 
we also decided that everyone would give me

30:35.275 --> 30:40.583
complete backing and support. And I didn't really 
need those skills. All they needed was someone to

30:43.988 --> 30:46.531
get the balloon thing started. And that's a nice 
challenge.
