WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:05.602
It was funded through the collegiate licensing program and it still is.

00:06.584 --> 00:13.934
And let me see how many scholarships, I forget how many we have on that, but it's a significant number.

00:14.254 --> 00:18.059
But it is funded through the collegiate licensing program here.

00:19.221 --> 00:26.390
But Robert Smith was a guy that came up with the initial idea on that and told me to go design a program.

00:27.472 --> 00:31.337
Make believe that you were employed now as a consultant.

00:32.768 --> 00:38.096
to advise Texas A&M about the future of the Corps at this university?

00:38.416 --> 00:39.598
What advice would you give them?

00:44.826 --> 00:54.981
Well, I think, you know, there's some things that need to happen, need to change in the Corps.

00:55.362 --> 01:00.750
I think if we're not careful, the Corps is going to get so outdated

01:02.266 --> 01:06.851
that it will lose appeal and the numbers will shrink and go away.

01:08.472 --> 01:15.019
I would tell the University of the Aggie Band is one of your strongest identification marks.

01:16.581 --> 01:18.303
You need to keep it very strong.

01:18.483 --> 01:24.849
You need to make sure that that band stays strong because it's a favor with a lot of folks out there.

01:25.410 --> 01:27.312
The band is a key to the court.

01:28.372 --> 01:31.836
If the band goes, I think the Corps would go too.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.839
It's a kind of an advertisement.

01:33.859 --> 01:34.259
It is.

01:34.299 --> 01:34.980
It is.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.162
And people love it.

01:37.743 --> 01:39.205
So keep the band strong.

01:39.285 --> 01:41.228
Do what you can to support it.

01:41.288 --> 01:42.970
They need a new band hall down there.

01:43.350 --> 01:45.974
The band hall was kind of put together.

01:46.054 --> 01:48.777
It looks like a...

01:49.246 --> 01:52.971
you know, an add-on over there that didn't seem to match or anything.

01:53.031 --> 01:56.797
It served a purpose, but we need a new band hall down there.

01:57.698 --> 02:01.703
To keep the band live and vibrant, we need some new things there.

02:02.845 --> 02:07.812
They've done a good job, and the band directors that they've had here, Ray Toler and

02:08.517 --> 02:13.022
The people before him, but the people Ray has on his staff have done an excellent job.

02:13.743 --> 02:18.469
But they need to use the band more in outreach and fundraising.

02:18.769 --> 02:21.512
And they've picked up on that in recent years.

02:21.572 --> 02:27.679
The band has been used very significantly in certain functions, some fundraising functions and all.

02:27.719 --> 02:31.344
But the band is a key element to this university.

02:31.444 --> 02:36.870
And BU Corps and Encore, they all feel proud of the band.

02:37.137 --> 02:39.539
and what it represents at A&M.

02:42.742 --> 02:49.588
Be careful with your connection relationship with the military services.

02:51.509 --> 02:55.713
We can't ignore that military relationship.

02:56.814 --> 03:06.722
We could fall out of favor with the military services and they kind of turn their back on us and leave us just plain vanilla.

03:07.495 --> 03:11.038
cadet program without a good commissioning program.

03:11.058 --> 03:30.617
Not that everyone's going to be commissioned, but we need to have a good base for commissioning here and keep a strong tie with the military services or we could lose a lot and they could turn against us and say, forget it.

03:31.698 --> 03:34.020
And I think that would be a big blow.

03:34.201 --> 03:36.743
If we don't, I think

03:39.642 --> 03:51.877
The university needs to continue to provide that scholarship program I talked about.

03:52.357 --> 03:56.382
There have been times when people said, well, we'd like to take that money and do something else with it.

03:56.402 --> 04:02.489
But the scholarships are key to maintaining a strong core.

04:03.090 --> 04:05.373
What size should the core be, numerically?

04:05.393 --> 04:07.034
I think 2,000 minimum.

04:07.976 --> 04:09.177
I think there's a...

04:10.051 --> 04:21.223
A critical mass that you have to have to have all the programs and to look like a core that should represent this university.

04:21.843 --> 04:27.089
At Virginia Tech, they've got 6, 7, 800 in their core and a student body of 25,000.

04:27.289 --> 04:32.915
I've always said 2,000 in my view is the minimum number.

04:33.616 --> 04:34.877
All right, is there a...

04:35.498 --> 04:58.637
uh a maximum number uh probably so uh one housing has something to do with that unless you change things up to have allow a lot more day students what might that number be twenty twenty six hundred twenty six twenty six hundred and that triggers an interesting thought when i came here there was no

04:59.174 --> 05:01.159
goal for core enrollment.

05:01.179 --> 05:02.562
I didn't know what it, you know.

05:02.983 --> 05:11.242
We got these 12 dormitories down here and they hired a new admissions director, Gary Englegall.

05:11.382 --> 05:15.411
I don't know if he came after your time there, but Gary came here from Illinois.

05:15.779 --> 05:23.009
And it was in my first year here, and he came over to pay a courtesy call on me, and we were just visiting there, and I was telling him about the court.

05:23.029 --> 05:24.612
Gary didn't understand any of that.

05:24.932 --> 05:27.115
You know, he hadn't come from this part of the country.

05:27.155 --> 05:29.639
And I said, see, that's our area out there.

05:29.699 --> 05:31.382
See those dormitories out there?

05:31.402 --> 05:33.264
And, you know, that's the court area over there.

05:33.404 --> 05:34.065
Oh, yeah, okay.

05:34.827 --> 05:35.968
Well, he's interested in enrollment.

05:35.988 --> 05:39.333
He said, well, Tom, you know, how many students are you trying to have down there?

05:40.815 --> 05:42.418
I said, well, that's a good question, Gary.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.841
You know, I don't know.

05:45.665 --> 05:48.570
I said, I really want to fill up all those dormitories down there.

05:48.650 --> 05:50.654
That's my initial goal.

05:50.674 --> 05:53.238
That's, I think, whatever that is.

05:53.379 --> 05:54.661
Well, I didn't know what that was.

05:55.001 --> 05:56.825
Nobody would ever say it.

05:56.845 --> 05:59.890
I did a little research and found out that's 2,600 students.

06:01.493 --> 06:03.556
But he told me, he gave me some good advice.

06:03.576 --> 06:09.006
He said, Tom, you know, you need to have a goal for what your enrollment ought to be.

06:09.475 --> 06:16.386
and said, you know, you need to get that approved by the university, and that becomes the university's goal to have 2,600 cadets.

06:17.107 --> 06:19.010
I said, by golly, you're right.

06:20.071 --> 06:32.991
That spring, I went up to see Dr. Vandiver with John Colas, and I said, Dr. Vandiver, I want to propose to you that we have a 2,600 goal for the Corps of Cadets, that be the official university goal.

06:33.472 --> 06:34.253
He didn't say anything.

06:34.273 --> 06:36.597
He just pounded the table and said, Tom, you got it.

06:37.775 --> 06:42.201
Man, I walked out of there feeling like I'd really accomplished something getting a 2,600 goal.

06:42.641 --> 06:45.205
But since then, that has become our goal.

06:45.665 --> 06:54.216
The Vision 2020 statement, General Hopgood was instrumental in getting them to include 2,600 as the official goal for the Corps Cadets.

06:54.597 --> 06:56.760
That fills up all those rooms over there.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.702
Now, you say, what's the upper limit?

07:00.565 --> 07:05.571
You could have a little more than that, but I think 3,000 would be a...

07:06.226 --> 07:11.272
And, you know, perhaps more than that if you change things up some way.

07:11.332 --> 07:17.719
But practically speaking, I think 2,600 remains a good goal.

07:17.739 --> 07:21.583
And we were on a track, and we set out in the early 90, 92.

07:21.903 --> 07:25.367
We said, okay, by the year 2000, we want to be 2,600.

07:25.948 --> 07:27.650
That was our goal, fill a quad.

07:28.511 --> 07:30.152
2,600 by the year 2000.

07:30.793 --> 07:32.675
I carefully tracked that every year.

07:33.556 --> 07:36.199
And through my last year over there,

07:36.179 --> 07:41.070
We were on the rise, but things have kind of flattened out.

07:41.270 --> 07:49.969
Recruiting has become much more difficult today, and so we're kind of hovering around that 2,000 mark right now.

07:51.637 --> 07:57.386
And it's going to take a real stretch of things to reach 2,600 in my opinion now.

07:57.987 --> 08:02.153
I think we're struggling to hang on to 2,000.

08:02.233 --> 08:10.947
But if the core starts falling down to 1,800, then 1,500, then 1,400, I think you're on an ending trend.

08:12.089 --> 08:13.371
And that's what we've got to avoid.

08:13.391 --> 08:19.500
I'd give advice to try to keep that core up to 2,000 right at that as a minimum number.

08:20.965 --> 08:23.449
Okay, I don't have, what other topics?

08:24.812 --> 08:28.779
I think, but I think I've talked a lot more than I should.

08:28.819 --> 08:32.986
And how do you feel about A&M's future?

08:34.309 --> 08:35.330
Oh, I feel good about A&M.

08:35.972 --> 08:39.798
I think overall it's a university still on the rise.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.463
I think our best days maybe are still ahead.

08:44.246 --> 08:45.268
I see it.

08:47.071 --> 08:50.475
I don't know if we're going to make a top 10 in 20 years.

08:50.556 --> 08:52.919
And in my opinion, we don't have to.

08:53.099 --> 08:55.061
But, you know, we want to be a contender.

08:55.081 --> 08:56.283
We want to be pushing for it.

08:57.364 --> 08:59.767
And I see in a lot of areas we are.

08:59.948 --> 09:05.915
I think our infrastructure, physical plant and all, needs a lot of work.

09:06.416 --> 09:11.863
I walk around the campus and, frankly, I don't see that beautiful...

09:11.978 --> 09:15.482
set of buildings and all that I see on some campuses.

09:15.562 --> 09:17.865
And, of course, our climate and all has something to do with that.

09:17.885 --> 09:19.908
We're kind of a hodgepodge that's grown together.

09:20.468 --> 09:27.697
I wish someone would have taken a ball 50 or 100 years ago and said, let's be standard on some of these things.

09:27.717 --> 09:32.603
You know, we now have buff-colored brick for standard.

09:32.718 --> 09:37.166
The infrastructure seems to me is not in good shape.

09:37.206 --> 09:38.288
The streets are not in.

09:38.308 --> 09:39.831
A lot of them are very poor.

09:40.953 --> 09:44.980
Joe Routt, I don't know anything's been done to it for years, but they're going to do some work over there.

09:45.261 --> 09:46.864
But a lot of good things coming along.

09:46.944 --> 09:51.011
I can just look back over my 14 years and see all the things that have been added.

09:51.051 --> 09:53.115
There have been some great things added here.

09:53.175 --> 09:57.122
That rec center, beautiful complex, great.

09:57.102 --> 10:04.535
MSC's been expanded, but I walk through that MSC every day and it's getting a little old and tattered.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.901
But a lot of those things need work.

10:09.144 --> 10:13.171
But hopefully there'll be resources to do some of that.

10:13.391 --> 10:18.440
You know, I don't want us to forget those things as we press on in certain areas.

10:19.722 --> 10:21.726
I've talked to new students

10:21.807 --> 10:23.789
new student conferences in the summer.

10:23.809 --> 10:32.279
I used to make all those conferences and we'd talk to every core group and parents and all and talk to kids and I've heard them express themselves.

10:32.660 --> 10:34.362
You know, why did you select A&M?

10:35.223 --> 10:48.338
Oh, we visited Baylor and Texas and all these other places and, you know, we pulled into College Station and we looked over there and saw that campus and that fit our view of what a college away from home ought to be.

10:48.959 --> 10:50.481
It's exactly right.

10:51.018 --> 10:54.302
You know, we're not an inner city school.

10:54.342 --> 10:56.726
It's lost in a great mass of people.

10:57.166 --> 11:01.232
You can look out there and see Texas A&M, where it begins and ends.

11:01.892 --> 11:07.940
And that's a concept of college that a lot of people still have that's good, in my opinion.

11:09.282 --> 11:11.185
But we need to keep the campus looking good.

11:12.767 --> 11:14.689
But I feel very good about the future.

11:14.810 --> 11:17.233
Academically, it's come a long way.

11:17.273 --> 11:20.417
I'm concerned that...

11:21.157 --> 11:25.864
Like a lot of people, we've got to the point that it takes long to get a lot of students through school.

11:27.306 --> 11:30.170
We need to some way jack that up.

11:30.510 --> 11:34.156
I think I had a donor call me the other day.

11:34.176 --> 11:35.678
He gave 16 scholarships.

11:35.718 --> 11:41.386
Maybe I mentioned this, that 11 of 16 had 12 hours or less.

11:41.426 --> 11:42.127
Very concerned.

11:42.147 --> 11:47.755
I'm not going to put any more money in scholarships when students are not more serious about finishing than that.

11:48.781 --> 11:55.737
I heard Fred Brown speak this week and he's been big on promoting things that would take advantage of our

11:56.797 --> 12:23.209
facilities here see maybe through the summer put a cheaper price on it to some way encourage people to get on through here and we could take more students that's a trend that a little bit disturbing to me that where in old days it was a stigma if you didn't finish four years now it's quite the accepted norm and there are reasons for some of that but I'm a little concerned about that but as far as

12:23.493 --> 12:28.200
The staff and faculty, I think A&M's in very good shape.

12:30.744 --> 12:39.257
I think Dr. Bowen, all the presidents I've worked for, you know, have been good people and they have a different set of circumstances to deal with.

12:40.719 --> 12:52.116
Each one and, you know, how the other would have handled that, I don't know, but I think Dr. Bowen has done an extremely fine job here during his time and he's not...

12:53.328 --> 12:57.873
You know, I don't know any advice to give him.

12:57.974 --> 12:59.576
I think he's just done a fine job.

12:59.596 --> 13:06.964
As far as the Corps, which I've been involved with primarily, he'd been very supportive of that.

13:07.685 --> 13:11.690
Of course, his own experience, I think, set him up pretty well for that.

13:12.191 --> 13:16.596
You know, whether the next president ought to be an Aggie or not, I wouldn't insist on that.

13:17.657 --> 13:21.462
I'd be happy if he were.

13:21.863 --> 13:25.288
You know, there's some good folks that have been presidents that haven't been Aggies.

13:25.328 --> 13:36.383
So I remember when I came here, it seemed like they told me, they said, man, you're one of the few Aggies that they've hired here.

13:36.403 --> 13:39.948
You know, it seemed like the trend is to hire people from not Aggies.

13:39.968 --> 13:46.858
And I remember there was a study done back then to try to document, you know, how many Aggies were hired.

13:47.834 --> 13:53.522
Some of them told me I was about the only one they could think of, but I've seen a good mixture.

13:53.562 --> 13:55.184
I think it requires a good mixture.

13:55.204 --> 13:59.650
When I ran the Corps, I said, I don't want all Aggies on my staff.

13:59.670 --> 14:02.574
It's good to have some here that can form some basis.

14:02.994 --> 14:12.627
It can provide a historical setting and have some recognition of some things, but I think you need a good mixture of people.

14:12.775 --> 14:17.500
And I believe that, but I think A&M has a good mix here.

14:17.580 --> 14:23.366
I think, you know, the minority thing, obviously, we've got to reach out more there, and that's a tough one.

14:24.067 --> 14:39.643
I don't know how to solve it, but I sincerely believe that we need a greater percentage of minorities, but the community and a lot of things have to change, I think, to help make that happen.

14:42.290 --> 14:42.919
It's good too.

14:43.793 --> 14:44.503
Very good.
