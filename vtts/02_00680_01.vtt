00:01.921 --> 00:09.393
Harrington Building, who has been in the College 
of Education before it was even a College of

00:01.921 --> 00:09.393
Education. He's going to share some ideas and some 
thoughts and some perceptions of the things that

00:09.513 --> 00:28.705
have happened over the last 20-some years and fill 
me in on what you feel has impacted this college and

00:09.513 --> 00:28.705
some of the changes, some of the things that have 
change mainly, I guess, is what I'm interested in.

00:31.908 --> 00:37.815
I'm interested in your own personal perception 
versus what I can find in some of the books. I want to

00:37.935 --> 00:44.703
know a little bit about your feelings and about the 
culture and the climate of this college and how it

00:37.935 --> 00:44.703
has evolved. Well, that's a very broad, 
open-ended kind of question. But let me say that I

00:53.053 --> 00:58.219
think major impact on the college has been the two 
deans that have been part of one that was part of the

00:59.110 --> 01:13.028
history and one that was current.

01:14.309 --> 01:28.307
Dean Hubert, who of course later became 
chancellor,

01:14.309 --> 01:28.307
had a strong background in education and it was 
obvious that he was highly qualified to help this

01:28.945 --> 01:36.435
institution develop a college of education.

01:39.438 --> 01:52.215
And so his perspective, particularly in terms of 
how A&M might serve the state of Texas, I think was

01:39.438 --> 01:52.215
very important. Did you have any input back then 
when this was in the process of being bounced

01:57.076 --> 02:00.299
around, were you able to have some? There were a 
series of meetings. And in fact,

02:03.022 --> 02:17.917
there was a meeting in Caldwell at the motel there, 
which name I don't remember at the moment. The

02:18.338 --> 02:19.078
Surrey Inn? Surrey Inn. And we had a three-day 
session over there. And who was involved in that?

02:31.728 --> 02:40.619
Well, I think a fairly substantial number of the 
faculty in the college, in the Department of

02:31.728 --> 02:40.619
Education at that time. I don't know that all were, 
but certainly a majority were. And out of that, I

02:46.786 --> 02:56.057
think that Gilbert used the input from those from 
that session as at least a significant part of the

02:56.442 --> 03:01.067
development of the plans for the college. A 
similar meeting took place in Galveston, I think

03:02.048 --> 03:16.865
perhaps at the end of the first year that after the 
college had been formulated. And that involved,

03:17.846 --> 03:25.555
again, perhaps selective faculty members from 
the college, but also included quite a number of

03:25.855 --> 03:50.631
school superintendents and other people from out 
in the field that helped to make suggestions as to

03:25.855 --> 03:50.631
what they thought this college of education ought 
to be like.

03:51.860 --> 03:57.246
So your initial statement had to do with the two 
deans and Hubert being, of course, the catalyst

03:51.860 --> 03:57.246
that got it. I think that I would add to my comments a 
little bit more reference to Dean Corrigan, who,

03:57.266 --> 04:13.363
of course, has been our second dean in

03:57.266 --> 04:13.363
almost 20 years. We're 18 years. When I finish 
this, it'll be 20 years. It'll be 20 years. And so

04:17.588 --> 04:20.871
two deans.

04:22.420 --> 04:25.242
for that period of time, a pretty good record. 
Either we have been easy on our deans, or they have

04:25.763 --> 04:34.590
been either very enduring or something. Is the 
lifespan of a dean fairly short on the average? I

04:39.494 --> 04:41.656
know for superintendents it is, but... I think the 
tenure of deans is longer than school

04:41.676 --> 04:47.001
superintendents. But Dean Corrigan brought, I 
think, a different perspective from his more

04:53.234 --> 05:06.034
national experience and quite a different style 
of serving as dean. And I think he has challenged

05:06.054 --> 05:19.596
the faculty at the college to

05:06.054 --> 05:19.596
be abreast of what is going on and what those 
national issues may be in order to formulate this

05:20.656 --> 05:31.249
college in the direction in which it might really 
have important characters. Has that changed, in

05:31.269 --> 05:37.657
your opinion, how outsiders view the College of 
Education since he has come on with this

05:31.269 --> 05:37.657
perspective? Has it focused or has it changed 
that?

05:43.385 --> 05:46.669
I don't know that I have real evidence of that. I 
have an assumption that that since Dean Corrigan

05:50.525 --> 06:16.110
is better known nationally that there are more 
people who know about Texas A&M and understand its

05:50.525 --> 06:16.110
program and have had continuing contacts with

05:50.525 --> 06:16.110
with our Dean so that We probably have continued to 
be better known. And I think Dean Corrigan has

06:20.416 --> 06:24.942
added greatly to that. And the mission of the 
college, of course, is the teaching, research,

06:24.962 --> 06:30.169
and service. In your perception, how has that 
changed or has it changed in the two

06:30.890 --> 06:38.179
administrations, the focus or the? I don't think 
that's changed.

06:45.385 --> 06:55.277
That's very much a part of the land grant 
tradition, and certainly was the focus from our

06:45.385 --> 06:55.277
beginning in education. Although, of course, it 
obviously is not limited to our particular

06:56.919 --> 07:00.964
college.

07:04.888 --> 07:12.878
A college of education, I think, does have

07:04.888 --> 07:12.878
more contact with the field than some colleges. 
Certainly not the only one that does, but it has a

07:17.889 --> 07:25.181
continuing relationship with people out in the 
field. Dr. Hawkins, is there a variation within

07:25.922 --> 07:33.533
departments as to how much contact there is with 
the field? Or is it up to the department heads how

07:33.714 --> 07:41.025
much they focus on that service versus the 
research or the teaching or whatever? Well, I

07:42.018 --> 07:46.325
think the nature of each department is such that it 
does.

07:49.870 --> 07:56.721
It may make a difference in terms of the people in 
the field that are contacted. But I wouldn't want

07:57.081 --> 08:05.814
to suggest that any single department would have 
less contact in this department. Since we are a

08:05.835 --> 08:10.742
department-based state administration, always

08:11.448 --> 08:38.586
prided ourselves and endeavored to maintain as 
strong a contact with school superintendents and

08:11.448 --> 08:38.586
other administrators in the field as possible and 
we have had over the years our so-called june

08:11.448 --> 08:38.586
conference and some other activities school 
board workshop that

08:11.448 --> 08:38.586
has

08:42.430 --> 08:47.396
that's been part of our contact mechanism.

08:47.736 --> 08:53.963
There has been tremendous growth, obviously, 
since you came here within this college and, of

08:47.736 --> 08:53.963
course, within the department. Has that 
affected, to any extent, your work with students?

08:57.507 --> 09:00.130
Has it made any difference? I think so. I think that 
it has tended to make each of us,

09:02.973 --> 09:12.083
as faculty members in this department, more 
specialized. When I first came,

09:15.495 --> 09:23.545
three of us at least had been superintendents. The 
assumption was that we needed to be

09:23.625 --> 09:31.936
able to make contact with superintendents. But 
also, this seemed to suggest that we were pretty

09:31.956 --> 09:40.146
much generalists and that we felt and need and 
perhaps a capability in identifying with

09:40.733 --> 09:49.401
education in a broad sense.

09:51.203 --> 10:09.340
As we expanded the number of faculty members, we 
sought to do that in terms of people who were

09:51.203 --> 10:09.340
specialists and who were expected to fill that 
kind of role within the department.

10:10.552 --> 10:23.232
Although in recent years, we've begun to focus 
back, in a sense, with several people at one time or

10:10.552 --> 10:23.232
another teaching the same course. Nevertheless, 
we still have our identity where we fit in the

10:25.015 --> 10:31.324
department program. You were department head for 
a number of years. What did you look for in your

10:34.169 --> 10:38.736
faculty members, or what was something that that 
you really, as department head, stressed?

10:44.918 --> 10:54.627
Of course, particularly in the early days,

10:44.918 --> 10:54.627
people without an A&M degree. Because for

10:57.129 --> 11:05.938
at least the first 10 years or so,

11:07.370 --> 11:13.738
hardly ever was anybody with an A&M degree even 
seriously considered. Dr. Hoyle, of course, was

11:13.759 --> 11:17.784
our first exception to that. And the 
justification for Dr. Hoyle was that he had left

11:17.804 --> 11:35.908
this institution, had served in at least three 
other universities, and so came back to us with an

11:17.804 --> 11:35.908
experience base that was reasonably broad. There 
have been several other exceptions in more recent

11:40.887 --> 11:52.000
years, but that was one of the criteria that we were 
very conscious of. Was that your own personal, or

11:53.362 --> 11:57.747
was that for the whole university? No, no, not the 
whole university, but that was Dean Hubert's.

12:03.574 --> 12:05.777
Well, it may have been

12:08.423 --> 12:11.246
referred to as a university policy. But 
obviously, each college adhered to that policy to

12:11.326 --> 12:26.805
a greater or lesser degree, depending upon the 
direction and priorities of each of the

12:11.326 --> 12:26.805
respective deans. And Dean Hubert was quite firm. 
And again, there were exceptions over the years,

12:32.352 --> 12:36.777
but by and large, a real effort to assure that we 
didn't just employ our own people. Now, I think

12:42.320 --> 12:58.124
that in addition to that, we were always conscious 
of people wanting to bring in people with good,

12:42.320 --> 12:58.124
strong preparation in education 
administration. That means that we were

12:58.184 --> 13:05.295
conscious particularly of the institution from 
which they got their doctoral degrees. We have

13:07.300 --> 13:17.714
hardly, but almost entirely without exception, 
looked for people with administrative

13:07.300 --> 13:17.714
experience.

13:22.780 --> 13:31.352
It also had a concern over the years for a more 
diversified faculty. It might not always have

13:31.372 --> 13:35.417
looked that way.

13:37.591 --> 13:51.768
But we did employ,

13:37.591 --> 13:51.768
I think, one of the first minority faculty members 
in this department of anywhere in the college. It

13:52.428 --> 14:02.540
might have been the second or so, but it was, I 
think, the first with Dean Hubert's

13:52.428 --> 14:02.540
encouragement. Unfortunately, that person 
stayed with us only one year.

14:08.759 --> 14:18.514
I think that in the early periods, our emphasis was 
more upon minority males than on minority

14:08.759 --> 14:18.514
females.

14:21.018 --> 14:34.519
Composition of the department faculty now, you 
can see that we finally found the right road to

14:21.018 --> 14:34.519
travel with

14:21.018 --> 14:34.519
females as part of our faculty. But I must say that

14:38.881 --> 14:43.585
I think that kind of diversity has been very 
significant. And the interesting thing, I think,

14:43.605 --> 15:03.443
is that our faculty in our most recent decisions 
seem to be very firm in their belief that such

14:43.605 --> 15:03.443
decisions to employ such individuals is very 
important for us. There's been a lot of stability,

15:03.463 --> 15:08.027
has there not, in this department as far as 
continuity of the faculty and the number of them

15:08.530 --> 15:13.878
being here for many years? I think so. We obviously 
have had some changes, but over the years, I guess

15:15.601 --> 15:27.699
probably a greater amount of stability than might 
be found in many similar departments.

15:30.343 --> 15:32.426
Is there something that you can attribute that to? 
Other than the fact that you all were happy? Oh, I

15:37.252 --> 15:44.378
think one would hope that there's a relationship 
between that and a terrible selection of people.

15:46.340 --> 15:52.085
I suppose that another important factor was the 
growth of the university. The fact that it's a

15:54.247 --> 16:05.757
little easier for people to stay with an 
institution in which there is growth, progress,

15:54.247 --> 16:05.757
at least some improvement in terms of faculty 
salaries, all of those kinds of things. What about

16:14.367 --> 16:16.350
promotion and things? Was it easier? I'm not 
familiar with the tenure track. Did that have

16:24.442 --> 16:27.326
anything to do with promotion? Yes, I think so. In 
the earlier days,

16:34.357 --> 16:46.873
The route to promotion and tenure was,

16:34.357 --> 16:46.873
I don't know if I should say relaxed, but at least 
was a little bit faster, perhaps.

16:50.057 --> 17:03.334
And that has slowed down so that now it is through 
university policies and procedures, it is a more

16:50.057 --> 17:03.334
carefully monitored

16:50.057 --> 17:03.334
process. But I wanted to add one other thing in 
terms of faculty members remaining in the

17:05.423 --> 17:12.494
department. And I think certainly the growth of 
the doctoral program, not just expansion of

17:12.514 --> 17:29.158
enrollments in the department, but the fact that 
we grew heavily in the direction of doctoral level

17:12.514 --> 17:29.158
work. And many faculty members prefer to to be 
where there

17:35.360 --> 17:42.610
is a strong doctoral program. OK. How about some of 
the highlights or some of your contributions

17:43.351 --> 17:54.185
personally to the growth of the college and the 
department?

17:57.770 --> 18:01.755
Just personal insights or observations, 
whatever.

18:07.068 --> 18:33.109
I think one of the things that we tried to do in this 
department,

18:07.068 --> 18:33.109
and hopefully because we supposedly know and 
understand something about the administrative

18:07.068 --> 18:33.109
process, I think we tried to create here what

18:07.068 --> 18:33.109
represents a department. It always seemed to me, 
as I tried over the years to contact people on this

18:35.148 --> 18:45.301
campus, you'd make a contact, you couldn't reach 
people. When you reached somebody at the

18:45.802 --> 18:49.387
department level, they didn't know where people 
were. They didn't know when they would be

18:49.427 --> 18:51.690
available. There seemed to be

18:52.351 --> 19:01.543
much more emphasis upon the autonomy of faculty 
members simply serving the university with the

19:01.945 --> 19:14.116
department responsibilities

19:01.945 --> 19:14.116
seemingly not to be a very important factor. And

19:14.136 --> 19:31.311
I don't know that I'm sure you get varying opinions 
from our own faculty, but I think we've known and

19:14.136 --> 19:31.311
understood better than some portions of the 
university of what the department's identity

19:32.219 --> 19:38.807
perhaps means. OK. And have you reflected much on 
the future and what is happening right now in

19:38.827 --> 19:53.523
education and some of the reforms and what effect 
they might be having on the college in, say, the

19:38.827 --> 19:53.523
year 2000 or beyond? Well, I've reflected some. It 
may be a little easier to reflect. You're not

20:04.673 --> 20:09.178
department head, and you don't seem to feel as 
though you have the same kind of responsibility.

20:10.740 --> 20:28.197
But

20:10.740 --> 20:28.197
I think in terms of the whole reform movement, that 
at some point

20:10.740 --> 20:28.197
along the line, I began to feel not as comfortable 
as I used to.

20:36.033 --> 20:48.773
But all of the people who have become so defensive 
about the charges

20:36.033 --> 20:48.773
against education. I think that's easier at our 
level than it is at the public school level where

20:48.793 --> 20:55.163
the school superintendent is

20:58.147 --> 21:00.891
is closer to some of the challenges, perhaps. But I

21:01.932 --> 21:12.566
have been less uncomfortable than some people 
with the demands for change. And therefore, I

21:14.849 --> 21:27.867
think to see education administration function 
in this department as

21:14.849 --> 21:27.867
that hopefully being able to adjust and to work 
within some new structures or some new

21:28.218 --> 21:47.255
perspectives

21:28.218 --> 21:47.255
that

21:28.218 --> 21:47.255
I think really have to come. OK. I think the people 
who have always thought, we do have a little

21:47.355 --> 21:55.082
outside influence, don't we? Is that the building 
downstairs? I don't know what's going on at the

21:56.904 --> 21:58.225
moment. I think the people who have always thought 
that teacher salaries and salaries in general and

21:58.880 --> 22:15.662
education administration could improve first 
and that that's going to make us a profession.

22:18.145 --> 22:23.071
I can't see where that point of view has gotten us 
very far. It seems to me as though we've We're now in

22:25.441 --> 22:50.740
an era in which we really begin to look upon the 
kinds of responsibilities in education with a

22:25.441 --> 22:50.740
different perspective, and the realization

22:25.441 --> 22:50.740
that we need to be 12 months employees, and we need 
to see our responsibilities somewhat

22:25.441 --> 22:50.740
differently. I don't know that I have said very 
well what I mean, but at least that's just a point of

22:52.829 --> 23:00.677
view that I have. Dr. Hawkins, in your years here, 
have you seen any more or less collaborative

23:01.618 --> 23:15.192
efforts within this college, among departments, 
and then within the college with other colleges?

23:15.212 --> 23:16.613
Has it changed any? I think so. It's a little hard to 
measure that because we haven't been writing it

23:19.964 --> 23:26.071
down over the years. But although we've always 
been encouraged to do that, I think that Dean

23:26.311 --> 23:39.867
Corrigan has contributed greatly in terms of that 
kind of emphasis. The inquiry structure

23:41.249 --> 23:49.498
at least suggests a framework in which that can 
take place, and I think

23:51.233 --> 24:03.831
to a greater extent than what existed before, it 
has accomplished its purpose. I

24:03.851 --> 24:20.295
guess that

24:03.851 --> 24:20.295
what that has done is to have created some working 
relationships and so on, which have been

24:20.967 --> 24:31.457
strengthened through

24:20.967 --> 24:31.457
more formalized research projects and that sort 
of thing. I think there's more of that taking place

24:31.477 --> 24:36.141
than used to be. One of the things that I'm working 
on at organizational behavior class is

24:36.161 --> 24:44.008
decision-making processes and the hierarchy and 
so forth. Has that changed much since you've been

24:44.028 --> 24:46.390
here? Or has it always been from the top down? Well, 
yes. Of course, I think it used to be more so under

24:53.304 --> 25:01.575
Dean Hubert than it is under Dean Corrigan. Part of 
the difference is in their administrative

25:01.735 --> 25:07.443
styles, as I mentioned. Of course, again, I hope 
those of us in this department understand how that

25:08.184 --> 25:21.062
works and can be somewhat more .

25:23.962 --> 25:31.454
There needs to be opportunities for 
participation. And I think that in recent years,

25:31.474 --> 25:51.285
there's been a good deal more faculty input, 
faculty participation

25:31.474 --> 25:51.285
on the allocation of university research monies, 
that sort of thing. of activities during the year

25:53.324 --> 25:58.330
and so on. Most everybody I talk to is a little 
reluctant to share what they feel has been their

25:58.350 --> 26:06.340
greatest contribution. There's sort of a little 
reluctance there. Do you have any ideas looking

26:09.984 --> 26:22.740
back what you feel has been maybe your 
contribution to the growth of this college or this

26:09.984 --> 26:22.740
department or both?

26:26.365 --> 26:48.119
I think if there's anything that led to my 
surviving for a period of time,

26:26.365 --> 26:48.119
it may be that in part because I felt myself to be a 
generalist.

26:48.139 --> 26:53.487
I had quite a lot of years of administrative 
experience, but I must say that a department

26:54.833 --> 27:00.819
head's position is quite different from anything 
that I had previously experienced.

27:03.762 --> 27:21.819
But I

27:03.762 --> 27:21.819
think a desire to try to

27:03.762 --> 27:21.819
get the talents of our faculty,

27:03.762 --> 27:21.819
as well as their idiosyncrasies.

27:21.839 --> 27:22.039
Of course. And that's for all those questions.

27:32.212 --> 27:37.818
When you say that the department head job is quite 
different, can you elaborate for just a second on

27:32.212 --> 27:37.818
that? What is it about being a department head that 
is, I have not really visited with too many

27:37.898 --> 27:43.884
department heads yet, so. Well, the comparison 
that I referred to is that an administrator in

27:52.276 --> 28:20.089
elementary and secondary education despite the 
fact that almost all administrators come up

27:52.276 --> 28:20.089
through the ranks and therefore they have been 
teachers and despite the fact that there is an

27:52.276 --> 28:20.089
assumption and a reality that there is a division 
between teachers and administrators it seemed to

27:52.276 --> 28:20.089
me at least in the period of time when I served in the 
public schools, that

28:22.094 --> 28:47.895
if it's not a matter of faculty agreeing with what 
administrators have to do, it seems to me as though

28:22.094 --> 28:47.895
there's more of an acceptance, at least. It's 
tolerance, whatever. In this level versus in the

28:49.752 --> 28:52.755
public schools? No, within the public schools. 
Oh, I see. Within the public schools. In higher

28:55.678 --> 29:00.643
education, nobody agrees with anybody about 
anything.

29:04.626 --> 29:09.671
I think people sort of view that as maybe 
personally demeaning. Those are kind of strong

29:11.573 --> 29:13.875
words. I'm just saying them partly for effect.

29:19.216 --> 29:28.066
University faculty can sit around for hours and 
debate something and never end up with any kind of

29:19.216 --> 29:28.066
decision. And

29:28.246 --> 29:48.548
one thing that I guess I have had to sort of become 
accustomed to and wish that I could change but

29:28.246 --> 29:48.548
never could, it was that tendency.

29:49.507 --> 29:55.256
a child trying to get approval from a parent, 
there's always one more reason why something

29:49.507 --> 29:55.256
can't be done. And university faculties, I think, 
are sort of like that. There's always one more

29:59.322 --> 30:03.329
point of view to be added. So we're never short of 
points of view. But you do it very good naturedly.

30:10.938 --> 30:20.750
OK, and finally then, I know you don't have a 
crystal ball, but do you see anything in the year

30:10.938 --> 30:20.750
2000 and beyond that will be significant in your 
opinion? What is going to be different about this

30:20.790 --> 30:24.054
college, possibly? I

30:24.074 --> 30:35.148
think that

30:24.074 --> 30:35.148
we're going to continue to have a college 
education. How about that way? Because there have

30:38.172 --> 30:40.455
been some times, and there are some some 
possibilities, you see, that colleges of

30:41.414 --> 30:52.885
education are dinosaurs, I guess. Do you really 
believe that? No, but there are lots of people who

30:56.028 --> 30:59.231
think that. And I know one faculty member, this 
reference to dinosaur is not really my own. I'm

31:06.158 --> 31:08.400
like some other people. in the federal government 
that maybe borrowed from others.
