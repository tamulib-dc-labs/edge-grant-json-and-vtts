00:00.031 --> 00:07.739
In the early 30s,

00:00.031 --> 00:07.739
you couldn't find anybody in Texas except a 
Democrat. My grandfather, boy, he'd read the

00:08.760 --> 00:17.770
paper every day and anything that was counted as a 
Democratic party. Of course, you couldn't get

00:17.790 --> 00:22.795
elected in the South, but particularly Texas. And 
so they may have been Republican philosophy

00:22.815 --> 00:27.540
somewhere, but... But as you just mentioned, very 
few people knew anything about Republicans. You

00:33.270 --> 00:34.993
had to go back to Hoover. And everybody said he was 
responsible for depression, which, of course, he

00:35.013 --> 00:38.397
wasn't. But he happened to be the guy that gets 
blamed for it.

00:47.390 --> 00:56.363
So no, to answer your question, I guess a political 
philosophy never did enter my mind. as I was

00:57.642 --> 01:02.287
growing up.

01:02.307 --> 01:09.214
And I don't know anybody that I associated with 
very strongly because nobody ever talked about

01:02.307 --> 01:09.214
anything except Democrats. Now, over the years, 
would you consider yourself a conservative,

01:09.234 --> 01:15.100
moderate, or a liberal? And what parties did you 
support over the years?

01:24.794 --> 01:28.699
I'm ashamed to say this, but until I retired, I 
never did vote. And the reason why it makes it very

01:30.341 --> 01:35.729
difficult for the military, because you're gone, 
you've got to send in an absentee vote. And up until

01:36.129 --> 01:39.133
a few years ago, you had to pay your poll tax. And I 
wanted to go pay poll tax and back to the, which I was

01:40.335 --> 01:47.685
against poll tax. We know what the poll tax was for. 
It keeps the blacks away. And poor white kind of

01:54.578 --> 02:05.570
eliminated a whole element of society.

02:08.032 --> 02:22.948
But to answer your question, I think I've always 
been more on the conservative side

02:08.032 --> 02:22.948
in political philosophy.

02:23.772 --> 02:28.317
Of course, if I had voted back in those days, I would 
have voted for Roosevelt, no question in my mind.

02:31.180 --> 02:32.782
What about more recent America?

02:38.769 --> 02:42.333
I guess I tend to be more conservative. I vote 
Republican now. I voted in every election since I

02:43.815 --> 02:48.480
retired, local and then I'm active now in the 
community. And are you a member of the Republican

02:53.200 --> 02:57.105
Party? Yeah. But back in those days in the 
military, once again, there are two reasons for

02:59.428 --> 03:03.773
that. That's pretty typical. A lot of officers 
didn't vote. Well, one reason is that nobody has

03:07.016 --> 03:17.809
ever appealed to the military to... We've never 
been involved with politics. And I'm horrified

03:18.869 --> 03:22.333
when somebody tries to tie us to politics. For 
example, they wanted to fire the chairman of the

03:22.994 --> 03:32.023
Joint Chiefs, see, because he supported a program 
of Carter. Well, that would be a hell of a note if we

03:32.985 --> 03:47.020
ever got to a point that every time you change 
presidents, you purge your military and get rid of

03:32.985 --> 03:47.020
all the leaders and bring in somebody else, you'll 
end up being like a banana republic. And that was a

03:47.978 --> 03:49.419
very dangerous thing. But fortunately, Reagan, 
an advisor, said, absolutely not. He will

03:55.526 --> 03:58.048
continue and fulfill his term. And he's not going 
to be replaced because he went along with

03:59.429 --> 04:03.453
reluctantly. And he's an Air Force officer. 
Reluctantly was the B-1.

04:10.961 --> 04:16.146
You can't have military to lead a revolt against 
their, I don't mean a physical revolt, media

04:17.003 --> 04:22.810
revolt against the president if you disagree with 
the decision he's made. All you got to do is resign

04:23.771 --> 04:27.275
if that's the way you feel. And most of them, and I 
subscribe to this, they can do more good for all of

04:28.216 --> 04:39.328
the principles that they stand for to stay rather 
than to run. That would be a difficult situation

04:39.368 --> 04:44.614
too if every time the president made a decision 
that the leaders and the military disliked, they

04:44.813 --> 04:47.177
would all resign.

04:50.903 --> 04:53.987
Because a professional soldier to me is the 
nation. Just like West Point, duty, honor, and

04:54.308 --> 04:56.632
country. And it's not political persuasion. And 
so from that standpoint, I don't think the

04:59.296 --> 05:04.164
military should get involved in politics. Now 
voting, of course, is a different thing. But even

05:05.886 --> 05:12.677
then, I don't think we should get out a letter to 
each other and say, now let's all get together. and

05:14.480 --> 05:17.423
vote Republican or Democrat or something like 
that. And you work with your troops, you know, you

05:17.503 --> 05:20.326
tell them. Yeah, absolutely. So the military 
ought to stay completely away from politics, even

05:22.448 --> 05:33.178
if it means that you're not taking advantage of 
your vote. The other thing is, I don't think that

05:33.198 --> 05:42.327
somebody stationed in Germany, which I spent some 
time there in other parts of the world, should have

05:44.332 --> 05:47.136
an influence on a local election. They're not 
there. They don't know the people. So they'd have

05:49.820 --> 05:51.242
to vote either. Somebody said, hey, would you 
please submit your application and vote for

05:51.663 --> 05:56.489
so-and-so? And they don't even know the issues. 
That's right. You don't even know the person. It'd

05:59.834 --> 06:02.939
be better if you just stayed out and let the people 
who are not. We have a situation here in Austin

06:04.701 --> 06:12.853
that's kind of, well, we who live here, it's kind of 
touchy. The university students, they vote on a

06:13.171 --> 06:16.835
local issue. And some of them, for example, now 
it's coming up here in the fall, the nuclear plant

06:17.716 --> 06:26.145
down in Bayport. Now you have these young people 
that come in from all over the state, and they vote

06:26.165 --> 06:33.853
here in a local election. They graduate, and 
they're gone, or maybe not even. They've elected

06:38.258 --> 06:42.402
members of the council, for example, Most of them 
are liberal, idealistic, as they should be. So

06:50.146 --> 06:52.969
they vote for the liberals. So as a result, the more 
conservative are defeated. Well, it's good for

06:58.515 --> 07:03.260
the liberals to be on there, but I don't think it's 
good for the conservatives. Of course, it isn't

07:03.981 --> 07:06.003
the university students' fault. This is the other 
side of the coin. If the eligible voters would get

07:07.204 --> 07:10.448
out and vote, That wouldn't be such an influence. 
But they don't do that. So anyway, going back to the

07:16.108 --> 07:18.651
military, it's the same. We should not be 
political at all. Now, when you were in the Corps,

07:23.035 --> 07:27.660
tell me about your unit. Well, at that time, we had a 
regiment that was

07:42.524 --> 08:11.265
a

07:42.524 --> 08:11.265
regiment of those students who did not live in the 
dormitory day students complete with company

07:42.524 --> 08:11.265
commander who was a day student my company 
commander was rucker you know him he's the he's

07:42.524 --> 08:11.265
still active around there he was head of

07:42.524 --> 08:11.265
the What is it, the guy who does all this 
landscaping and that sort of thing?

08:17.111 --> 08:24.638
Environmental, urban and environmental 
planning.

08:24.658 --> 08:24.758
Yeah. Oh, he's in a magazine here just the other 
day. Rucker, he's

08:28.602 --> 08:34.307
a company commander. Heart of Culture, I guess he 
is. Oh, okay. Yeah. He was a professor there for a

08:36.590 --> 08:38.251
year. He just recently retired, and now he's He 
still got a job doing something around there.

08:47.334 --> 08:51.098
My roommate was a company commander, a wrecker, 
Bill Rector. He lives in Kern now. But I wasn't out

08:54.281 --> 09:02.490
as second lieutenant the senior year.

09:02.510 --> 09:03.771
So we farmed and drilled it. Everything except we 
didn't live in the area. Drilled right along with

09:06.694 --> 09:09.737
them on burial day. And this was C Company, I 
forget. I guess I can look it up in the yearbook. How

09:15.807 --> 09:17.369
many were in the company?

09:23.095 --> 09:23.836
As I recall, about 150. There

09:23.956 --> 09:32.306
were four or five companies in the battalion, and 
there were three battalions. Did you plan the ban?

09:34.128 --> 09:34.848
Not any of them. I worked my tail off. Oh, you didn't 
have time to plan the ban? I'm not sure I could play

09:41.020 --> 09:43.723
well enough snare drum. I don't know. I never did 
try out because it was impossible because I

09:44.383 --> 09:50.189
couldn't. Because I worked before. Classes, 
after classes, and on weekends. What kind of

09:55.594 --> 09:56.555
student were you? About an average. Tell me about 
hazing. Well, we even got hazed even though he was a

10:02.581 --> 10:06.504
day student. Sure. And even though I was a 
sophomore, I still wore the white strike, which we

10:10.973 --> 10:13.956
wore then as a freshman. See, I was a freshman at 
A&M, even though I was classified as a sophomore

10:14.076 --> 10:20.481
academically. Oh, yeah. Got those great big 
things wrapped with tape, heavy, and heat to pick

10:21.782 --> 10:30.449
them up. It'd particularly get you if you went up in 
a hall, see? And you shouldn't be up there. Some of

10:36.575 --> 10:40.558
those stuff would probably get you if you And even 
down there on the dairy farm, the seniors and the

10:40.994 --> 10:52.084
upperclassmen,

10:40.994 --> 10:52.084
nobody ever got hurt, which you'd be sure would get 
bruised. What was the purpose of hazing, do you

10:54.246 --> 11:01.313
think?

11:01.333 --> 11:03.415
Well, of course, stupidity. Sadistic.

11:07.298 --> 11:07.879
Child. childlike behavior.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.552
A custom, see, and then they have to maintain the 
custom. And finally, the freshman comes up to

11:19.713 --> 11:25.799
class and he says, this is the way I was treated. Do 
you think there's any beneficial aspect to

11:28.321 --> 11:31.144
hazing?

11:35.948 --> 11:37.630
There is, but I don't think it's justified by the 
result.

11:44.266 --> 11:46.049
See, they have hazing at West Point. I spent four 
years there as an instructor, not as a student.

11:51.958 --> 11:53.240
It's not called hazing. They call it custom there. 
Of course, they don't beat them. You can't touch

11:59.649 --> 12:02.453
another cadet at West Point. But sometimes it 
would be much better if you did touch them because

12:03.918 --> 12:15.208
one of the things they do there is holding up the 
wall, for example, where you squat and you stay

12:03.918 --> 12:15.208
there and finally you just collapse. It would be 
better, like they did at A&M, is to have you bend

12:15.228 --> 12:23.275
over and take a few licks and go on to something 
else. Of course, there's other kind of hate in A&M.

12:25.737 --> 12:32.203
But speaking of A&M, I read an article in Texas 
Monthly, I guess it was, about A&M, and they said

12:33.162 --> 12:36.346
this is a custom that had been going on for years. I 
didn't recognize any of those things when we were

12:37.608 --> 12:46.639
there, yet they say that's a long-standing custom 
of all these people. I thought that was a pathetic

12:46.659 --> 12:48.541
article. This is the one about two or three months 
ago? Yeah. It's

12:53.528 --> 13:00.216
supposed to have been written by a nagging. But 
anyway, the beneficial part of hazing only is

13:01.850 --> 13:24.865
this, that if you have an environment, a 
controlled environment, and it's difficult, and

13:01.850 --> 13:24.865
those who are tested and pass the test, major up to 
the test, one would conclude that they are better

13:01.850 --> 13:24.865
men having experienced this and now. But the bad 
part, the negative part of that, how many really

13:24.885 --> 13:30.473
outstanding people who just say, To hell with 
that. I'm not going to put up with this. Life's too

13:33.089 --> 13:35.051
short. That might have been the best student that 
you're going to have here. So you think that Hazen

13:39.557 --> 13:42.040
might have kept some good students away? Well, 
probably so. But me, I was proud of it, see, once

13:47.187 --> 13:49.550
again. As I go through this, you'll probably say, 
well, you were quite naive, perhaps I was. But to

13:56.559 --> 13:59.262
me, I didn't mind it. And I could do anything 
anybody else could do, and nobody was going to beat

14:00.878 --> 14:09.770
me down or break my will of spirit. Even used to that 
baseball games would make you eat tobacco, not

14:09.790 --> 14:19.122
chew it, you know, but put it in there and drink, 
take some water. Of course, that makes you deathly

14:19.663 --> 14:22.266
ill and can kill you, of course. Very serious, the 
same as others. like paternities do with all this

14:26.208 --> 14:33.679
drinking where an individual actually can't even 
drink a fifth of liquor or something like that. The

14:33.719 --> 14:37.104
system can't tolerate that. So hazing, there may 
be some aspects, like at the military academy,

14:37.424 --> 14:44.314
that's controlled.

14:47.118 --> 14:49.682
But the thing about it, your upperclassmen, their 
kids also. Seniors doesn't mean that they're just

14:50.183 --> 14:53.007
so mature they're going to be sure. And you get some 
sadistic people. the kind that would kick and

14:56.954 --> 15:00.778
torment an animal, you know, kill things. Well, 
you let that kind of guy under the... You give him

15:00.798 --> 15:06.784
power. Yeah, you get him, and you go to really have 
something. And that's the reason why hazing,

15:09.767 --> 15:16.874
there's no place for hazing anywhere, at A&M or at 
the military academy. Mental and physical

15:16.894 --> 15:18.056
hazing. That's right. Now, at the military 
academy, it's really tough, the way they handle

15:19.918 --> 15:25.223
their pleas. But it's more of an endurance than it 
is a physical abuse. Let's say you can't touch

15:31.952 --> 15:34.515
another cadet. Do you think it's tougher? Do you 
think that the mental hazing there was tougher at

15:35.636 --> 15:44.226
West Point than it is at A&M, the physical hazing? I 
mean, which one is tougher to survive?

15:51.435 --> 15:53.337
Well, probably the military academy. The only 
thing I can compare to the military camp is that I

15:55.358 --> 15:59.122
was never a cadet. But I was in the tactical 
department. I worked with the cadets every day and

16:01.924 --> 16:04.727
every night.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.991
But that environment is so different. See, lights 
go out at a certain time. And if you're found in the

16:13.476 --> 16:22.464
train studying, you're

16:13.476 --> 16:22.464
given demerits for it. If you get so many demerits, 
you've got to go out and walk them off So there is a

16:25.970 --> 16:29.795
very rigid control environment. I'd even go this 
far to say it's probably the closest to a perfect

16:31.317 --> 16:36.183
environment. I'm not talking about hating, 
hating outside, but you will find. What do you mean

16:41.950 --> 16:44.654
perfect? Well, there's no lying, cheating, or 
stealing.

16:49.940 --> 16:51.943
And you don't tolerate anybody that does.

16:54.860 --> 16:57.563
You're forced to go to chapel whether you want to. 
Everything is controlled. You're fed a rounded

17:01.787 --> 17:08.214
meal, although in hazing, they don't let their 
police eat square meals. But morally, everything

17:10.076 --> 17:12.319
about it is. And it misleads some cadets, 
particularly if they come there when they're

17:14.281 --> 17:18.305
naive. From a sheltered home, they go through 
that. They get the rudest wagon you've ever seen

17:21.235 --> 17:29.186
whenever they get out in the real world and find out 
that the people you were dealing with were lie,

17:21.235 --> 17:29.186
cheat, and steal.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.474
It's a shock to them. That's what I mean. For four 
years there, without a controlled environment.

17:42.185 --> 17:43.427
And I thoroughly enjoyed that. It's an 
inspiration. Now let's get back to the Corps. What

17:47.733 --> 17:50.837
were the things that you liked about the Corps? 
Well, of course, every ag is a spirit. Yeah. You

17:55.962 --> 17:59.726
don't have to be there very long at all. You know 
that you've got a lot of friends and through life.

18:04.672 --> 18:05.753
Even though you don't know them. I go around now, I 
might be taking my car to the garage to have it

18:06.093 --> 18:11.099
serviced. And I had an old time the other day that 
said, I see you've got an ag in what class, you know.

18:17.766 --> 18:19.508
And you go up. Felix Daly, who has a dealership here 
in tires and other things. He's a . So I go there to

18:29.087 --> 18:31.990
buy tires. I never knew him before, but I knew he 
was. And not only does he give you a good deal, but

18:36.634 --> 18:41.239
the service is great. And so it's not. This,

18:41.860 --> 18:49.427
of course, is a little bit monetary benefit But 
it's just the spirit. And it goes on and on. It's

18:57.072 --> 18:58.153
football games. Of course, this is about the old 
stadium or the earlier stadium. If you go there,

19:04.479 --> 19:07.703
you can just feel it. So I'd say the spirit

19:09.424 --> 19:19.414
in the academic program

19:22.330 --> 19:25.314
Were there any things about the Corps that you 
disliked?

19:33.645 --> 19:33.886
No. I didn't particularly dislike the hazing, 
although I'm against hazing.

19:42.077 --> 19:46.583
What way do you think that the Corps helped you in 
your career?

19:53.650 --> 19:55.732
a great deal for the training. Because I really 
thought a lot of our tactical losses we had there,

19:57.374 --> 20:13.549
the camp we had, the bullets, and the parades, and 
the bands. At that time, it was the nearest thing to

20:14.910 --> 20:19.995
West Point. And they prided themselves. And most 
of our tactical officers were West Point

20:22.067 --> 20:30.354
graduates.

20:30.374 --> 20:33.597
Many of them died in World War II in the 
Philippines. They also just happened to rotate.

20:36.660 --> 20:40.864
They left there just about time to go to the 
Philippines and get killed or captured. So the

20:42.866 --> 20:46.589
training was very helpful in your career. 
Anything else? If you're... See, I'm... I'm

20:51.768 --> 21:02.582
perceiving it, or really experiencing it, as an 
individual who had an objective to become a

20:51.768 --> 21:02.582
professional officer. So I would get more out of 
the Corps than an individual who says, well, I

21:02.602 --> 21:08.970
enjoy all of this. In fact, right around the corner 
up here is Dennis Aggie. And boy, he was a high

21:17.020 --> 21:20.965
ranking. was a lieutenant colonel. He commanded a 
battalion. But he loved all of this, yet his

21:29.462 --> 21:35.231
profession, and what he always wanted to be, was a 
dentist. So maybe it's more than just because I was

21:35.251 --> 21:45.227
interested in that type of thing, because, and he 
goes back, he even went to, we played Michigan.

21:45.247 --> 21:47.049
They went up there to Michigan for that game. Of 
course, he wished he'd stayed at home when they got

21:47.109 --> 21:50.074
40 to, two on it or something, or three, something 
like that. And so I, besides the spirit and the

21:55.219 --> 22:09.132
academic, and

21:55.219 --> 22:09.132
of course I didn't miss the lack of recreation 
because I was working on it. Sure, absolutely. In

22:10.053 --> 22:13.056
those days, of course, they were out in the 
boondocks, you know. Do you think there was

22:13.076 --> 22:19.302
anything about being in the Corps that might not 
have helped you, that might have hindered your

22:13.076 --> 22:19.302
career or your advancement?

22:22.235 --> 22:28.784
Do you think that the Corps had any impact on you 
becoming a general officer, becoming a leader?

22:29.786 --> 22:33.030
Oh, I'm sure it did. What was it? It was a training. 
Because, see, ROTC is training leaders. Training

22:41.702 --> 22:46.509
young men to be leaders. And so everything you do in 
a Corps of Cadets, besides the instructions you

22:47.110 --> 22:52.157
get, It's toward that end. That's where you have 
cadet officers, student officers, and right on

22:54.166 --> 22:59.213
from a corporal sergeant. So you give them that 
leadership training. Yeah, small. We do the same

23:02.538 --> 23:07.065
thing, officer academy school, same thing to 
military academy. Now, were there professional

23:07.085 --> 23:13.655
soldiers at A&M that had a particular impact on you 
or an influence? You said the training was tops.

23:16.379 --> 23:19.223
And who were those West Point men that had that? 
Well, one of them was Moses, Captain Moses. Yeah,

23:22.158 --> 23:24.901
I've heard of him. Fair enough. How did he 
influence you? Well, once again,

23:29.405 --> 23:43.759
he sort of epitomized the spittin' pollies.

23:47.302 --> 23:50.545
They were wrecked and everything he did. military 
bearing, you know. And you just say that he looks

23:53.883 --> 24:00.493
and acts like what I would consider to be a military 
officer. And too, in those days, you know, they

24:00.513 --> 24:04.940
didn't have any colonels, no generals, you know. 
In fact, when I later on, when we get to it, when I

24:05.420 --> 24:10.147
went to Fort San Houston, I had to graduate.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.595
At that time, the entire army was only 130,000. We 
have more officers now than then. He was a

24:20.731 --> 24:22.733
peacemaker. And so being a captain, we did have a 
major, major then, I've forgotten his name. One,

24:27.459 --> 24:32.786
though, was Moore, who was a later general officer 
who was captured in the Philippines. Moore?

24:33.447 --> 24:36.991
Moore,

24:33.447 --> 24:36.991
yes. I think he was a graduate also of A&M.

24:42.258 --> 24:49.827
But the one that I really enjoyed, I wouldn't 
select him as a role model, but... He was named Orr,

24:50.026 --> 24:51.848
O-R-R. He was an East Texas guy. He got his 
commission in World War I, so he wasn't a west

24:55.831 --> 25:04.498
corner. He gave us a lot of enjoyment, just the way 
he talked and the way he acted, although he was very

25:04.518 --> 25:13.847
military and a very good solid individual. He 
wasn't a comic or anything like that.

25:19.827 --> 25:21.809
But I guess all those would be Moore. Moses 
particularly, I would say, because he was younger

25:22.630 --> 25:27.434
and worked more closely with us. Moore, I think, 
was .

25:34.100 --> 25:35.321
But he wasn't a commandant. Because we had a 
civilian commandant, a very big, fat guy that used

25:35.381 --> 25:41.326
to be able to suck in his gut and his pants would drop 
off. He had great thinking. Then Moore later on

25:44.970 --> 25:46.851
became a commandant. That's right. And I forget 
that, now that was a comic when he used to drop his

25:47.738 --> 25:52.847
pants and have Yale practice. Did all the other 
things. So he'd get up there and suck in his gut,

25:53.948 --> 25:57.394
down his pants.

26:01.882 --> 26:06.810
Now, if we compared Second Lieutenant's products 
from A&M and West Point and other ROTC schools,

26:08.393 --> 26:18.546
what would you say about the quality of those brand 
new second lieutenants? You mean today? No, back

26:19.748 --> 26:20.949
then. Back then? Yeah. Back in the 30s.

26:29.680 --> 26:37.270
Well, of course, it's difficult to compare them 
with West Point

26:29.680 --> 26:37.270
because of the amount of military training, I'm 
talking about then, that they have as compared to

26:38.043 --> 27:02.910
the amount of,

26:38.043 --> 27:02.910
because they have military training not only 
during the year like we have at A&M, you know, with

26:38.043 --> 27:02.910
three classes a week or two classes a week, but each 
summer they're involved in living a military

26:38.043 --> 27:02.910
life, see the camp and so forth. So when they 
graduate, then when they graduate, they have a

27:08.148 --> 27:09.469
considerably more experienced.

27:14.094 --> 27:28.888
Well, that would have put A&M superior to the other 
ROTC programs, except when you consider the

27:14.094 --> 27:28.888
Citadel, VMI, and API. No, the school up in

27:28.908 --> 27:33.953
Massachusetts.

27:38.152 --> 27:47.241
But BMI and the Citadel, they are very similar to 
West Point in that they devote much more time. But

27:49.083 --> 27:56.350
A&M in those days would,

27:49.083 --> 27:56.350
I'd say, be right up there. Of course, I'm biased. 
I'd put A&M next to the military academy. But those

28:00.114 --> 28:06.100
other schools are very fine. From a military 
standpoint. But in general, from military

28:07.770 --> 28:13.095
training, you put West Point on number one tops. 
Yeah.

28:19.802 --> 28:21.864
Because they're limited 24 hours a day. Yeah. OK. 
See, every class. Of course, it's impossible now.

28:27.570 --> 28:28.791
You're not comparing. You can't compare the Corps 
cadets.

28:35.442 --> 28:41.248
At A&M now, of course, I don't know how they operate 
now with West Point. Because I say, there is 24

28:41.268 --> 28:43.230
hours a day.

28:47.014 --> 28:58.086
Even their academic

28:47.014 --> 28:58.086
is military controlled discipline type thing, 
even though they have professors, of course, that

28:47.014 --> 28:58.086
are highly qualified. And they have permanent 
professors, which means that they no longer, they

29:03.978 --> 29:05.520
won't actually do anything like that. Most of 
them, of course, have PhDs in their particular

29:06.642 --> 29:10.587
specialty.

29:15.133 --> 29:18.618
But now it's different. In many cases, a graduate 
of ROTC now can run out of school now. We're talking

29:24.927 --> 29:30.975
about right after graduation.

29:30.995 --> 29:33.799
Because of the school system that you graduate 
from A&M, Then you go to, well, first you go to,

29:34.589 --> 29:41.619
their summer camp now is much different than the 
summer camp we had. It was more intense.

29:45.845 --> 29:48.468
So they got training very similar. Now I'm going to 
appear to contradict myself. People think of West

29:51.733 --> 29:55.738
Point as being just a military. But they spend so 
much of their time on academics, when you add it all

29:56.920 --> 30:02.908
up together now, there isn't a great deal of 
difference. Both of them intend to get their

30:03.563 --> 30:07.268
education after they graduate. In other words, 
you have basic training as a lieutenant, and

30:08.590 --> 30:11.614
you're qualified then. But you really got to 
specialize. It didn't fare. And I know that, but we

30:14.618 --> 30:16.521
did at West Point. These kids graduated, and we 
sent them to Korea while I was up there. And I went to

30:20.666 --> 30:24.091
Korea and interviewed all of these youngsters. 
And it wasn't fair to put them out and throw them

30:24.111 --> 30:29.318
right into combat, because they had intended for 
them to go to school, to Benning, to engineer

30:30.007 --> 30:39.917
school, wherever it is, and really develop the 
skill and the knowledge that you'd expect of a

30:30.007 --> 30:39.917
second lieutenant. And they had a heavy caliber. 
It wasn't because of lack of knowledge that they

30:43.041 --> 30:47.546
had caliber, indirectly it was. It's because they 
were going to prove that they were graduating

30:48.046 --> 30:53.472
military academy as second lieutenant. And so 
they were out leading when they shouldn't be out

30:54.493 --> 30:58.037
there. Yeah, right. They were sacrificed. They 
had heavy cases.

31:06.557 --> 31:11.103
Let's talk about your academic career at A&M. You 
were in dairy husbandry. Did you like the

31:13.245 --> 31:14.687
curriculum? Did you enjoy the courses?

31:18.652 --> 31:19.413
I had no idea. When I graduated from high school 
that I'd be involved in things like that. But,

31:23.758 --> 31:25.140
yeah, I enjoyed it. And see, in dairy husbandry, 
you've got production and manufacturing. And I

31:30.248 --> 31:32.850
was in the manufacturing part. And so I was doing 
what, you know, in the creamer there. Sure. That

31:36.994 --> 31:37.874
was helping you. And of course, you know, your 
basic course, you take chemistry and biology and

31:38.855 --> 31:46.102
English and history, you know, a whole range of 
things. So it didn't just down to the old dairy

31:46.122 --> 31:48.664
farm. Sure. Were there professors there that had a 
particular influence on you? Right. Jefferson

31:54.869 --> 31:55.650
did. He took the time, he interviewed, talked to 
us. In fact, he wanted to keep up with each student,

32:01.046 --> 32:11.696
so he had a plan where he called Jen every once in a 
while. They'd just say, well, how you doing? Are

32:14.199 --> 32:15.580
you enjoying your work?

32:19.023 --> 32:20.905
And he'd come in business there in Greenwood.

32:24.369 --> 32:25.890
Brilliant individual. He's from the Middle West, 
I think. Minnesota, I think, is where he came from.

32:32.559 --> 32:41.431
When you finished your education, did you ever 
give any thought to going into dairy husbandry, or

32:32.559 --> 32:41.431
did you want to go right into the military? Well, if 
I hadn't gone to the military, yeah. So that was

32:45.296 --> 32:46.818
your second choice then? Yeah. In fact, I even 
thought at one time that I might probably become a

32:48.420 --> 32:55.810
veterinarian. because I hadn't taken the 
courses. Of course, I had to go take quite a few

32:58.917 --> 33:11.731
more, but it wouldn't have been much difficult 
before that.

33:13.273 --> 33:26.387
In fact, I had planned, if I had not gotten my 
regular commission in World War II, I probably

33:13.273 --> 33:26.387
would have gone back to A&M to become a 
veterinarian. I would like very much to stay in

33:26.620 --> 33:34.609
Terry Hudson, particularly the manufacturing 
part of it. And I offered a job after I graduated in

33:34.629 --> 33:39.234
San Antonio. In fact, I went for an interview.

33:45.401 --> 33:48.985
But then I had applied for Thomason Act. I don't 
know if you ever heard of Thomason Act. Sure have.

33:52.589 --> 33:54.872
The Army was understaffed of officers. And West 
Point wasn't producing sufficient. So they had a

33:58.703 --> 34:03.750
shortage of officers, acute shortage. So this 
representative named Thomason had a bill passed

34:03.770 --> 34:24.859
that would call into service 1,000 officers,

34:03.770 --> 34:24.859
ROTC graduates, for one year

34:03.770 --> 34:24.859
competitive tour of duty, which out of that 50 
would be selected for a regular commission. So

34:30.637 --> 34:42.234
just when I was being interviewed, my name was 
approved to attend

34:30.637 --> 34:42.234
or to go for a year's active duty. Of course, that's 
what I wanted. So I went to Fort Sam Houston in the

34:44.818 --> 34:47.822
second division.

34:53.390 --> 34:55.133
And how long did you stay at Fort Sam? One year. And 
tell me about the training. This is 1938. Tell me

35:00.941 --> 35:06.085
about the training.

35:06.105 --> 35:10.409
Well, I would consider now on-the-job training. I 
had a company commander named Dansby, and so he

35:11.811 --> 35:25.423
took me under his wing to teach me about

35:11.811 --> 35:25.423
really how to be a company commander, being a 
company officer. And I was the only other officer

35:26.686 --> 35:28.429
they had. Unfortunately, I had Sergeant Bieber,

35:29.370 --> 35:38.805
a German immigrant that had been in the army. He got 
into the army when he was real young, in the US Army.

35:44.574 --> 35:45.795
And he got interested in me. So he taught me. Now we 
send them to service school to go through all of

35:49.481 --> 35:53.267
this. This was only job training. And that's what 
the purpose of the year. And then later on, we had

35:56.674 --> 36:00.900
organized formal school training. So obviously, 
I became the mess officer, the supply officer, the

36:00.920 --> 36:16.201
training officer, administrative officer,

36:00.920 --> 36:16.201
and any other odd job. Like we had the inventory of 
the and the commissary. So that only happened once

36:21.028 --> 36:22.410
a month. We also had to perform as officers of the 
day.

36:29.542 --> 36:32.084
And the other was officer of the guard, officer of 
the guard. He went down to the stockade, you know,

36:32.144 --> 36:38.590
and inspected the prisoners out working. So it was 
a full-time job. Now, each of the sergeants

36:41.373 --> 36:47.319
teaches, the supply sergeant would teach you all 
about supply and the book and so forth. Same thing

36:47.359 --> 36:50.642
with the mess officer.

36:55.077 --> 37:03.385
One anecdote that I think is, that I would know 
better today, of course, but being young and want

36:55.077 --> 37:03.385
to impress my company commander. And knowing your 
first day of duty, the importance to make a

37:05.447 --> 37:10.912
faithful impression. So I had my boots all shined, 
spurs, and I was ready. So I went walking in the C

37:17.698 --> 37:21.962
Company, 9th Infantry. The medical people are 
taking all that over now. And so I walked in fresh

37:26.212 --> 37:34.342
out of A&M as a second lieutenant. And when I walked 
in, I would have yelled, . Boy, I came to attention.

37:41.851 --> 37:44.574
Used to responding. And then when I discovered 
that he was calling attention for me, the second

37:44.594 --> 37:51.122
lieutenant walked in. And he was the orderly. Orly 
was outside the company commandant's door. So

37:55.816 --> 38:02.486
then when I felt that's what had happened and 
realized it, I started to step off. And my spurs,

38:02.506 --> 38:04.790
they will hang together. They hook together. I 
tried getting those unhooked. Of course, I was

38:09.256 --> 38:10.037
embarrassed. And you could see that Orly, looking 
at the tension, but he's kind of smirk on his face

38:10.057 --> 38:16.587
like, oh, it's this lieutenant. So I walked in, and 
Captain Danley saluted Lieutenant Andrews and

38:17.191 --> 38:22.456
reported the duty. He said, oh, I'm glad to see you. 
I'm looking forward to it. I've got all this work

38:25.538 --> 38:29.021
I've got to get done. And by the way, he says, we're 
getting ready to have a parade. And I want you to

38:34.486 --> 38:36.868
take the company, because I'm busy here. I said, 
yes, sir. He said, well, you better move on out,

38:40.872 --> 38:43.174
because they're getting ready. And so Sergeant 
Beaver came up to me, and he said, I said,

38:47.448 --> 38:53.095
Lieutenant, do you know anything about mass 
formation? No, never heard of it. He said, well,

38:55.157 --> 39:04.408
this is a test division for the new triangular 
organization, and we're drilling today on mass

38:55.157 --> 39:04.408
formation. That's where the parade was. I said, 
no, I know all about right by squad, squad to right,

39:07.732 --> 39:15.261
and you know all of that stuff, which we'd been 
doing at A&M and everywhere else in the Army except

39:07.732 --> 39:15.261
for St. Lucie. He said, well, I'll tell you what 
I'll do, Lieutenant. Instead of, you know, when

39:19.179 --> 39:24.326
you follow them, you just post and the sergeant 
goes around the back. He said, I'll stay right

39:25.928 --> 39:29.432
behind you. And he said, I'll give you every 
command that you need to do. And I said, okay.

39:37.923 --> 39:40.827
Knowing what I know now, rather than, you know, 
gosh, you could have a, tragedy out there, you

39:41.330 --> 39:44.113
know, here you've got people lined up. It's an 
entire division parade, you know, and I'm taking

39:44.173 --> 39:49.358
up the company, supposed to be the final of the 
battalion. But I didn't. I said, yeah, okay,

39:52.080 --> 39:53.902
Sergeant, thank you very much. So we went out and he 
said, come to Mass Right. Well, I said, come to Mass

39:57.185 --> 39:59.147
Right. You know, they all reacted. And he carried 
me around and gave me, of course, all I had to do was

40:00.108 --> 40:08.956
know, I knew all about grieving, you know, what to 
do and all that stuff. And we carried it all the way

40:08.976 --> 40:09.717
around. passed the review and came on back to the 
company and dismissed him. And the old sergeant

40:15.033 --> 40:17.556
said, Lieutenant, you did real well. And

40:18.077 --> 40:24.465
I said, thank you, boy, I'm really indebted to you. 
And the old Danvy committed me. He said, Sergeant

40:28.370 --> 40:30.893
Beaver tells me you did a good job. That was great. 
And I never did tell him that I didn't know anything

40:33.116 --> 40:37.541
about that. I don't know. He may not realize, I 
don't know, but I'd never send a lieutenant out

40:39.245 --> 40:43.530
like that. Boy, you can really mess up here and 
embarrass me.

40:50.619 --> 40:51.680
You want to go eat now? Sure,

40:51.700 --> 40:58.088
I can go eat. OK, we were talking about life at Fort 
Sam Houston. Yeah.

41:05.384 --> 41:14.776
After your year was over there, of course, it was 
questionable if you were going to give a regular,

41:05.384 --> 41:14.776
if you would receive a regular Army commission. Is 
that not right? And tell me how that transpired,

41:16.098 --> 41:19.142
how you received it. Well, as I said, the second 
part of the year, I had to get on the job training,

41:19.262 --> 41:31.999
which the sergeants taught us a lot, which you have 
to rely very heavily, all through the military on

41:19.262 --> 41:31.999
the sergeants. Then we had organized classes 
where we went to school and stayed. Those were just

41:38.079 --> 41:44.105
map reading, something such as that, weapon 
training. And then at the end, we were given a test.

41:47.508 --> 41:55.136
And at Fort Sam Houston, we had about 20 competing. 
And only one got a regular commission, which I

41:55.156 --> 42:01.142
wasn't that one. But he was an Aggie, and it was a

42:02.135 --> 42:20.115
name comes to mind is Cersei Bracewell, but I don't 
think that was the one. He was an artilleryman, I

42:20.135 --> 42:21.797
remember.

42:24.840 --> 42:31.247
So then after the year was over, of course, we had to 
wait to see whether or not And that didn't receive

42:32.189 --> 42:35.132
work. We found out later on it only once. So I had a 
month's leave. So I hitchhiked by air. People

42:46.065 --> 42:49.528
laugh when I say that, because how do you hitchhike 
by air? But went out to the military field to go to

42:50.590 --> 43:01.622
operations and ask for their plane going to the 
west coast. Finally, I got a ride out to the West

43:01.855 --> 43:03.917
Coast. San Francisco, went to the San Francisco 
World's Fair, which was one of the great

43:04.358 --> 43:11.485
attractions. Sally ran in the news range. And then 
hitchhiked, went out to one of the local fields,

43:15.789 --> 43:26.040
and hitchhiked back to Dallas. And this would be a 
great historical occurrence. It was a nonstop

43:30.544 --> 43:39.453
flight in a bomber from California to Dallas. It 
was overnight. We left about dark and got to Dallas

43:41.174 --> 43:47.120
early in the morning.

43:47.140 --> 43:50.784
It was a predecessor to the B-17 . Of course, it was a 
smaller plane, the B-17. Then I hitchhiked from

43:56.378 --> 44:05.107
Dallas, from Hensley Field to New York, and went to 
the New York World's Fair. This is 1939. Yeah, the

44:05.988 --> 44:17.881
big attraction there was Billy Rose and Aqua, I 
guess it was, with Esther Williams. Martin Downey

44:19.102 --> 44:20.844
was the singer. And then returned back to Texas.

44:27.091 --> 44:33.440
And went to work for Nettie Cade, the Ford place in 
Caldwell. But knowing that the way things were

44:35.323 --> 44:39.889
going, it looked like there'd be war pretty soon. 
But in the meantime, back to the 143rd Infantry,

44:41.532 --> 44:54.490
the Texas National Guard again, they were 
recruiting lieutenants. So I was contacted. and

44:56.605 --> 45:01.151
asked if I wanted to be a second lieutenant in the 
National Guard. And I said yes, so I transferred in

45:02.793 --> 45:06.718
the National Guard, second lieutenant. And soon 
thereafter, the National Guard was mobilized.

45:14.789 --> 45:15.650
And I think... In 1940. Yeah, in October 1940, May 
1st, November 1940. And that was the beginning

45:21.818 --> 45:25.903
of... Continuous active duty until retirement. 
And what happened to your status, your

45:30.499 --> 45:35.066
commission? Were you then commissioned as a 
reserve officer or as an active officer? You mean

45:41.996 --> 45:44.340
during World War II? Yeah. See, you were with the 
National Guard, which is usually a reserve army

45:44.600 --> 45:51.010
officer. Yeah. When did you get a regular 
commission? I was a reserve officer, a National

45:58.257 --> 46:05.865
Guard officer, which you say is the same, through 
World War II. And then they had the integration

46:08.467 --> 46:12.972
program.

46:15.514 --> 46:18.918
I was interested in that, of course. And I was 
stationed at Fort Benning. Infantry School as an

46:20.744 --> 46:24.429
instructor after World War II. And they started 
sending out telegrams, you know, to the people.

46:30.197 --> 46:36.587
And I didn't think I'd made it because I was one of 
the last ones to get it, even though my name started

46:30.197 --> 46:36.587
with A. Apparently they broke up the whole roster 
and those that sent that part of it, it was

46:36.627 --> 46:44.297
dispatched later than the others.

46:47.782 --> 46:48.203
And that was...
