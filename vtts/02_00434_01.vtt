00:02.495 --> 00:06.299
This is Rebecca Swigert interviewing Joseph 
Dudzik of the U.S. Army. Where were you sent to

00:08.221 --> 00:11.063
Vietnam? In July of 69. July of 69. Well, where were 
you sent in Vietnam? I was sent to Saigon. Did you

00:22.555 --> 00:24.677
travel out of Saigon very often? Yes, I did travel 
upcountry out of... Saigon to the various

00:30.625 --> 00:34.937
provinces and to the different cores. In Vietnam, 
the locations were named after the core which had

00:36.100 --> 00:44.182
control over the territory. I can't remember, but 
it would be like one-core, two-core, and

00:46.353 --> 00:50.640
three-core, and that would be staggered 
throughout the country. So you would go into, say,

00:51.161 --> 01:04.222
one time you'd go into I-core area, that would be 
one-core, of course it was I-core because it was,

00:51.161 --> 01:04.222
it was called I-core because they use a Roman 
numeral one, so it would be I-core, two-core, and

00:51.161 --> 01:04.222
three-core areas. And they would run from the, run 
from the delta up to the, as far north before you got

01:13.522 --> 01:18.068
into North Vietnam. Well, which military group 
were you assigned to? I was assigned to the

01:21.293 --> 01:32.168
First Logistical Command, which was located at 
Long Binh. First Logistical Command. And what was

01:35.192 --> 01:37.335
your rank in Vietnam? I started there as a major and 
got promoted in September of 69 to a lieutenant

01:41.939 --> 01:45.444
colonel. And this was all in the army? That's 
right. Okay. Now, you said your mission was the

01:50.492 --> 01:54.237
logistic? No, I was assigned to the first 
logistical command, which was the parent unit.

02:01.989 --> 02:08.098
But I had duty at a subunit, which was the United 
States Army Procurement Agency, Vietnam. United

02:09.158 --> 02:13.282
States Army Procurement Agency, Vietnam. So what 
was your personal role? I was the general counsel

02:15.805 --> 02:25.294
and staff judge advocate of the United States 
Procurement Agency, Vietnam. What does that

02:25.314 --> 02:26.936
mean? I was the chief legal officer. Okay, so were 
you directly involved then with the South

02:30.119 --> 02:38.507
Vietnamese government in Saigon?

02:40.850 --> 02:43.093
No, it wasn't a direct involvement. We did have 
some involvement in it because what we did buy in

02:43.133 --> 02:55.629
Vietnam, we had to buy a certain amount from local 
national businesses. A certain amount of the

02:55.830 --> 03:05.682
acquisition or procurement in Vietnam had to be 
from local national business, which would be the

02:55.830 --> 03:05.682
Vietnamese. So you did become involved with the 
Vietnamese government to some small extent, when

03:10.330 --> 03:16.636
you entered into these contracts with local 
businessmen. So what were the local businessmen

03:16.656 --> 03:20.019
friendly to work with? Oh, yes. The Vietnamese 
people were absolutely fantastic. The nicest

03:24.063 --> 03:27.627
people you'd ever want to meet. They were really,

03:27.667 --> 03:36.175
really wonderful people to associate with. You 
couldn't ask for nicer people. So good. So you

03:38.950 --> 03:42.893
personally had a lot of contact with them? Well, we 
had a lot of contact with them on the sense that we

03:42.913 --> 03:50.140
did business with them. And we did business like 
from the services we purchased. We purchased

03:54.724 --> 04:01.129
laundry services and some other types of stuff. 
And also the agency itself had quite a number of

04:01.149 --> 04:05.914
Vietnamese employees. I would say or perhaps a 
third of the employees in the agency were

04:08.701 --> 04:14.710
Vietnamese. Were they educated, very educated? 
Well, you would find all degrees of that. We had a

04:25.947 --> 04:36.683
secretary in the office whose father was a 
Vietnamese army officer and she was

04:40.139 --> 04:43.323
And she did all the clerical work in the office. And 
you had some that would do translation work that

04:43.704 --> 04:51.033
were highly educated. Translating documents. 
Because any sort of agreement with the Vietnamese

04:53.076 --> 04:59.785
to provide goods or services the document had to be 
both in English and Vietnamese. So you had people

05:04.767 --> 05:06.949
who were capable of doing this. So you had all 
degrees of intelligence. I guess the people that

05:09.593 --> 05:20.027
did the janitorial work were actually of lesser 
degree of intelligence, while the people that

05:09.593 --> 05:20.027
worked in the secretarial positions were more. 
And then we had some people that worked in the

05:20.448 --> 05:29.520
negotiating positions that were even more 
talented, more talented, put it that way. Wow.

05:30.106 --> 05:37.899
Well, what were these Vietnamese people, and 
maybe just the general Vietnamese people

05:30.106 --> 05:37.899
attitude toward the government in South Vietnam? 
Did they have a lot, did they, do you know if they had

05:37.919 --> 05:45.631
a lot of contact with the government in Saigon, or 
was it? Well, you know, the city seemed to be like on

05:45.651 --> 05:51.000
a war footing because of terrorism activities. So 
the government was all pervasive. I mean, there

05:53.670 --> 06:02.802
were soldiers on the street, there were police on 
the street, all armed, and we all went around armed

05:53.670 --> 06:02.802
because of the terrorist activity. So I would say, 
yes, they had an intimate involvement with the

06:02.822 --> 06:10.872
government just because the nation was on a 
wartime footing. Were they supporting the

06:10.892 --> 06:12.675
government? As

06:14.016 --> 06:19.924
far as I could tell, yes. In fact, I didn't have any 
doubts that they were supporting the government.

06:27.303 --> 06:33.892
But you could say, how accurate was this 
estimation or this opinion of yours? And you would

06:34.973 --> 06:40.039
say, well, I think if they weren't, they would have 
cloaked it. So I wouldn't expect it to be very

06:40.780 --> 06:44.064
visible. But I spoke to them, and Although the 
subject doesn't come up very much because it would

06:48.878 --> 06:53.563
be embarrassing to both parties. And it would seem 
like you were prying. And just as in this country,

06:58.408 --> 07:09.700
you don't, at a dinner party or at a social 
gathering, ask somebody their political

06:58.408 --> 07:09.700
preference. Some things are just not discussed in 
private company with the limited... unless one

07:18.528 --> 07:20.231
becomes very good friends. You know, you wouldn't 
speak with religion, you wouldn't speak of

07:20.271 --> 07:27.402
politics and some other items which are rather 
delicate. So it would never really get into that

07:27.422 --> 07:32.610
sort of a conversation. But I never saw, while I was 
over there, a dissatisfaction with the local

07:37.765 --> 07:40.888
government. Well, since you were sent in 1969 and 
the war had been going on for a long time, how did you

07:42.710 --> 07:54.283
feel about being sent so far into the war? Oh, it 
was, no, it really, that didn't create a problem,

07:54.303 --> 08:02.191
never really entered into it. It was just 
something I had to do as part of the career, so I went

08:02.932 --> 08:07.637
over there. And it passed very quickly. And it was 
very interesting. If you say, will you exchange

08:13.490 --> 08:17.235
the opportunity? Will you exchange the 
experience? Let's put it that way. For anything, I

08:23.064 --> 08:25.948
would say, no, I would not exchange the 
experience. You'd say, are you speaking strictly

08:26.469 --> 08:29.754
from hindsight? I don't think so, but it's hard to 
say.

08:38.296 --> 08:48.488
I knew where I was going before I left for Vietnam, 
but when I volunteered to go, it was a voluntary

08:38.296 --> 08:48.488
move on my part, I didn't know where I would be sent. 
But I did know before I arrived there. But no, it

08:52.253 --> 08:59.262
just didn't cause a concern. Just didn't cause a 
concern. Maybe it's fatalism. Well, were you

09:03.527 --> 09:07.712
among a lot of the soldiers that went out into the 
field very often? No, no, no. In this position, I

09:11.397 --> 09:13.220
wasn't. You would get to see them by visiting 
hospitals and that because we had contractors

09:14.261 --> 09:25.739
that furnished hospital supplies and laundry 
services and things for the hospital. So you would

09:26.159 --> 09:28.963
see them, you would see them when you went out to the 
field. In the place where I stayed, where I was

09:30.806 --> 09:35.353
billeted, We had people in and out. But you usually 
kept to yourself, not to yourself, to people you

09:37.741 --> 09:44.867
worked with. And if you didn't work with troops 
that were regularly going into the field, you

09:44.887 --> 09:56.417
wouldn't exchange conversation with them of the 
kind that you would get a feel with how they liked

09:44.887 --> 09:56.417
it. Well, did you have some kind of preconceived 
attitude or feeling about the Vietnamese people?

10:05.810 --> 10:08.393
or the American involvement in the war before you 
went over? No, only to the extent I had served prior

10:09.715 --> 10:15.443
to this in Thailand. And the Thai people were just 
excellent. And I thought, I guess, anticipated

10:21.411 --> 10:28.180
that maybe the Vietnamese wouldn't be quite as 
friendly because of what their country was going

10:21.411 --> 10:28.180
through. But that proved to be erroneous. They 
were just as friendly as the Thai people. Just

10:33.991 --> 10:37.937
really fantastic. You just really have no 
concept. I doubt if we were in similar

10:39.720 --> 10:46.210
circumstances, we would be the same. We'd be as 
generous, as kind, as giving, as understanding.

10:53.000 --> 10:53.120
Right. Well, okay, you weren't there during the 
Tet Offensive, but... No, I finished just right

10:53.140 --> 10:57.367
after it. Okay, so right after it. What kind of, how 
do you say, who do you put the victory to on the Tet

10:58.595 --> 11:04.323
Offensive? Because there's kind of a lot of them. I 
really, really don't know. What I would really

11:10.472 --> 11:18.443
say, hey, it was a minor setback for us tactically. 
which means the near term, so to speak.

11:22.823 --> 11:28.168
Strategically, we probably suffered a larger 
setback. But when I got there, my predecessor had

11:28.188 --> 11:35.214
been there during 10, I believe. And where the 
agency was located, which was in ,, which was right

11:36.155 --> 11:48.666
in the midst of where the tent was, we would go to 
various activities within blocks of the

11:48.848 --> 11:55.138
headquarters and they would say, you see this 
field here or this cemetery here? This was very

11:55.318 --> 12:07.296
severely fought over during Tet.

12:07.934 --> 12:20.888
Seeing, being there after Tet, I just didn't 
observe any defeatist attitude if someone would

12:07.934 --> 12:20.888
have perceived there that, hey, it had been a 
setback. There was none of that there. Everything

12:23.090 --> 12:35.443
was going forward with,

12:23.090 --> 12:35.443
I don't think anybody was really concerned over a 
repetition of that. Everybody looked at it as a

12:36.014 --> 12:38.437
sort of one-shot deal. Well, the one-year terms, 
do you feel that being sent for just one year, do you

12:39.198 --> 12:44.264
think that was effective? Do you think it would 
have been better to have a one-term amendment for

12:44.284 --> 12:56.738
longer than a one-year term,

12:44.284 --> 12:56.738
you know, to have a amendment? Well, I think it 
probably depended on the position you were

12:56.758 --> 13:00.823
occupying. Like in the position I was in, which was 
right in Saigon, we lived in a hotel. The strain

13:07.677 --> 13:11.682
wasn't at all that great. Although you were always 
concerned about the terrorist activities.

13:20.372 --> 13:22.575
So I could see that, hey, for a person serving with 
the agency two or longer than a year wouldn't have

13:22.943 --> 13:31.493
been a hardship. It might have been a hardship on 
personal families, but it wouldn't have been a

13:31.553 --> 13:37.300
hardship on the individual. Whereas someone that 
was going out on combat missions into the

13:37.320 --> 13:46.892
hinterlands

13:48.492 --> 13:50.795
It probably would have been a different color for 
them. They would have been glad to get out because

13:50.815 --> 13:53.498
it was strange. You said you lived in a hotel. What 
kind of class was it? What were the accommodations

13:58.224 --> 13:59.646
compared to that? Well, everybody had a room. 
Well, I think that depended on rank. I think there

14:06.735 --> 14:15.025
were two to a room if

14:06.735 --> 14:15.025
you were major or less. And I think as you went up in 
rank, You would get your own room. But it was, when I

14:19.979 --> 14:29.033
say hotel, it's a hotel in the sense that that's 
what it was originally used for. But it certainly,

14:29.513 --> 14:32.658
you wouldn't compare it to anything we have. It was 
about a six-story walk-up, and there were no air

14:33.099 --> 14:39.829
conditioning. So that wasn't a big deal. And the 
window in the room that I had faced out on an air

14:45.551 --> 15:00.086
shaft, so it was sort of

14:45.551 --> 15:00.086
stifling during the warmer weather. But 
compared, I guess, to somebody that was out in the

15:00.106 --> 15:06.612
field, I guess it was fairly luxurious. It was in 
the Chinese section of Cholan. It took us about 20

15:10.657 --> 15:17.666
minutes to a half hour to go each morning from the 
hotel to work. Oh, to work. What did you do in Saigon

15:19.068 --> 15:22.072
during the time you were off? What was there to do in 
Saigon? We worked seven days a week. Oh, you worked

15:25.376 --> 15:26.278
all the time? Worked all the time. Worked all the 
time. In the evening, they had... You ate at the

15:28.741 --> 15:36.411
hotel, and in the evening, they had a... They would 
get USO shows in and various entertainment shows.

15:41.639 --> 15:43.001
It was all USO shows. But they weren't...

15:49.310 --> 15:50.892
Very few American shows. American performers. 
Most of them Korean or Japanese or Philippine.

15:58.902 --> 16:00.484
That's right. And very nice and very enjoyable. 
So... In the routine, you would come home and have

16:05.821 --> 16:09.247
supper. And

16:09.287 --> 16:21.366
if it wasn't too late or you weren't too tired, 
you'd go to sit in one of these shows and maybe have

16:09.287 --> 16:21.366
either a drink or a soft drink or something like 
that. And then you would go to bed. That would be me.

16:26.895 --> 16:30.681
I had a shortwave radio and... You could sit up and 
get programs, as I recollect, from Australia. It

16:37.976 --> 16:40.902
used to come in pretty good in the evenings. Or else 
you could go to, right down the street, I remember,

16:40.922 --> 16:50.461
there was a New Zealand outfit. And you could go to 
that place and they would have... New Zealand and

16:54.455 --> 16:57.698
Australian beer. You would know you wouldn't, but 
you would have beer here. You didn't get tired of

17:02.103 --> 17:03.444
these things. You were sort of appalled after a 
while. So what you do is you get into a routine,

17:09.790 --> 17:14.795
going to work. And you worked till late in the 
evening, till sometimes 6 or 7 o'clock. So there

17:22.023 --> 17:24.445
really wasn't that much time. I

17:24.695 --> 17:42.483
know, I think I gave a half a day every other week, at 
least in my division which I worked. And it was a

17:42.503 --> 17:47.310
half a day, perhaps a Saturday afternoon. And 
people, of course, could go to church services on

17:47.628 --> 17:50.632
Sunday. But I just stayed there right through. I 
just didn't take the afternoon. Well, did you have

17:58.844 --> 18:01.988
any kind of contact with the army? Well, yes. Yes, 
we did, because we did supply certain things to

18:04.872 --> 18:09.358
them. But not really that much contact. I had more 
contact with the Vietnamese civilians. than I did

18:17.193 --> 18:19.336
have with the Arvin. So you wouldn't be able to make 
any kind of judgment of quality? No. In fact, as far

18:23.941 --> 18:31.210
as troops are concerned, I had more contact with 
the Koreans, because there were Korean troops

18:23.941 --> 18:31.210
that lived in the same hotel. We've read some stuff 
on the Koreans. What were they like? I mean, they

18:36.816 --> 18:38.058
could be brutal. Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Well, what 
really impressed you with the Koreans was, We had,

18:47.213 --> 18:53.358
we contracted for a lot of in-country trucking. 
And some of these contractors were American firms

18:53.378 --> 18:57.762
and some were Korean firms. They contracted and 
these firms did trucking for, between port and

18:59.043 --> 19:11.254
between various installations on a contract 
basis, which we paid them. And one of these firms

19:11.274 --> 19:16.478
was the Hanjin Company of Korea, a Korean firm. And 
they were closely associated with the White Horse

19:18.398 --> 19:25.928
Division, which was the Korean division there. 
And we had very little trouble with the Korean,

19:26.849 --> 19:46.414
with the Korean convoys being attacked or

19:26.849 --> 19:46.414
pilferage from the Koreans and that. They were 
usually very, very good. We paid a good price for

19:49.158 --> 20:00.130
them, but they were, I guess it was because they are 
very pragmatic people. They saw things as they

20:00.150 --> 20:07.057
were, and they had a certain firmness of purpose. 
And I was inclined to think that most of the

20:07.778 --> 20:15.726
contract employees, say for the Korean firms, 
ex-Korean Army. So the Hanjin Trucking Company

20:19.397 --> 20:24.328
was run like a military organization. If you 
visited their headquarters in one of the northern

20:24.408 --> 20:32.526
provinces, you saw barracks and uniforms and 
shoes lined up. You would think it was the Korean

20:32.546 --> 20:35.132
Army. So it was almost like a quasi-military 
organization, although it was civilian. I don't

20:41.773 --> 20:53.704
know whether the employees rotated between the 
army and the organization, but it had a lot of

20:41.773 --> 20:53.704
characteristics of a military organization. 
Well, then your department did the legal kind of

20:53.724 --> 20:58.949
contracts and stuff like that? We contracted for 
stevedoring services at the port. That would

21:03.713 --> 21:05.895
involve us with the Vietnamese We contracted for 
transportation services from the port to various

21:06.972 --> 21:33.250
installations, like we had Newport in Saigon, and 
we contracted for transportation from Newport to

21:06.972 --> 21:33.250
Longbin, which was the main base of the first 
logistical command and was really a very, very

21:06.972 --> 21:33.250
large storage depot.

21:34.765 --> 21:39.251
What our biggest contracts were for was 
engineering services. What they would do would be

21:40.993 --> 21:50.565
the posts and camps were run by a private concern. 
In other words, if you are, let

21:50.645 --> 21:59.777
me see,

22:01.411 --> 22:03.074
Something happened to the water main. The water 
was supplied. A private contractor would come in

22:05.799 --> 22:09.725
and do that rather than a military man. You mean in a 
camp? In a camp. In one of the private... That's

22:12.170 --> 22:14.073
right. That's right. So all the engineering 
services, the heating, the cooling, those types

22:15.535 --> 22:24.651
of services were contractor operated. So we had a 
lot of U.S. businesses over there. Yes, we did.

22:30.074 --> 22:40.709
Well, I don't say a lot because most of it was

22:30.074 --> 22:40.709
done by a few firms that sort of specialized in 
that. I remember one was Pacific Architects and

22:40.729 --> 22:43.453
Engineers. It was a very big firm handling that. 
Ford Motor Company. Ford Motor Company did a lot of

22:47.899 --> 22:53.187
our transportation contracts. Saigon, the 
Vietnamese government, they were all for the

22:53.555 --> 22:57.401
U.S.? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Well, what about this 
Vietnamization program where we were trying to

23:01.828 --> 23:09.962
get the Vietnamese to take care of themselves? I 
really didn't see that because that was out in the

23:10.943 --> 23:13.928
field. But...

23:18.530 --> 23:32.250
The Vietnamese program that I was involved with 
was, and I thought it was very successful, was to

23:18.530 --> 23:32.250
get more Vietnamese businesses to furnish the 
services. In other words, when I got there, there

23:33.471 --> 23:46.630
was maybe a requirement that, I don't know if I'm 
using the right figure, but say, for example, 5% of

23:33.471 --> 23:46.630
our contracts had to be with Vietnamese firms. And 
then they started to increase that to 10%, because

23:47.622 --> 24:13.075
they wanted to do something for the Vietnamese 
people, to give them not a stake in the outcome, but

23:47.622 --> 24:13.075
more an opportunity to become self-sufficient, 
to become businessmen, to do something for the

23:47.622 --> 24:13.075
local economy, to get the jobs down to the 
Vietnamese. So I always thought that was very,

24:13.095 --> 24:17.140
very successful, because it kept on increasing 
wildly. while I was there. So over your year, you

24:18.739 --> 24:21.784
saw a great increase? I saw an increase, a mandated 
increase. Who was mandating this? We were. Oh,

24:29.077 --> 24:30.579
yes. Well, I think it probably came from, not the 
military side, but came probably from agreements

24:31.240 --> 24:41.878
between the Department of State and the 
Vietnamese government. So we were interested in

24:43.175 --> 24:51.872
making the Vietnamese government a more viable 
and stronger entity. And I think one of the ways we

24:51.892 --> 24:57.343
could do this is by assisting their economy. And 
the way we assisted their economy was not just

24:57.584 --> 25:02.854
pouring money in, but making them work for it. So I 
think it was, and then we inquired our contractors

25:03.678 --> 25:19.218
like Han Jin and Pacific Architects Engineers, 
and there was another one, I forget, that ran power

25:03.678 --> 25:19.218
plants on boats off the coast. We required them to 
hire a certain percentage of Vietnamese labor. So

25:26.427 --> 25:31.153
there was a constant program that had a lot of 
forethought. to put money into the Vietnamese

25:31.842 --> 25:41.714
economy, but not just merely give it, but for value 
receipts. So that's where your department was all

25:41.734 --> 25:46.159
around these contracts? Well, that's right. We 
let the contracts, and we administered them. In

25:51.226 --> 25:52.787
other words, through completion. And I said there 
was a contract for operating floating generators

25:53.408 --> 26:01.478
to supply power to some of the coasts. or some of the 
other ones. There was a contract for laundry

26:04.805 --> 26:06.787
service. There was a contract for produce, fresh 
produce. There was a contract for ice cream.

26:15.016 --> 26:22.564
Things that you wouldn't think of as having a 
particularly warlike significance. But there

26:22.584 --> 26:25.207
was a contract to do the hospital laundry. There 
was a contract to sew the patches on the uniform. I

26:29.082 --> 26:30.824
wouldn't think of all this. No, no, no. But it was a 
very big operation, like the depot at Long Beach. I

26:38.956 --> 26:46.846
don't think anybody in this country, unless 
they've seen it, has any idea how large these

26:38.956 --> 26:46.846
depots were. I mean, it was... They were laid out 
like a checkerboard, geometrically, in other

26:49.850 --> 26:55.498
words, in squares. And... And...

27:01.010 --> 27:03.834
The country was flat where they were located in 
Longbren. It wasn't hilly. And you could stand on

27:05.597 --> 27:15.873
one of these streets that was maybe as wide as a 
boulevard and look to the end and you couldn't, you

27:05.597 --> 27:15.873
could hardly see the end. And on each side of you 
were boxes stacked up over your head, well over

27:17.836 --> 27:24.587
your head, stories high. And you could look either 
way, to the left or to the right, or down the center

27:25.462 --> 27:29.747
or back. If you were in the middle of this and 
couldn't see either side, all you saw was boxes and

27:30.127 --> 27:36.654
it was just like a city of supplies. And it was a 
men's job to keep track of it, to deliver it, and to

27:37.435 --> 27:44.823
know where it was and get it out. Was there a lot of it 
being stolen and sitting on black market? But yes,

27:49.508 --> 27:56.516
if you went down to Saigon, you would see stuff that 
was being stolen. But mostly it was PX goods, you

27:56.536 --> 27:59.260
know? Liquor, cigarettes, cameras, and that sort 
of thing. I remember once I was involved with a...

28:04.666 --> 28:14.858
We had lost a convoy between...

28:18.128 --> 28:23.493
Newport, which was in Saigon, one of the Newports 
in Saigon, and Long Beach. And what it had was

28:23.513 --> 28:28.517
several truckloads, as I recollect, branded. So 
it was a high desirability item. So we got a great

28:34.743 --> 28:37.525
deal of flack about this. And they said,

28:37.665 --> 28:46.633
well, what are you going to do about it?

28:47.474 --> 28:50.797
And there were all sorts of things, suggestions. 
Make the contractor take out insurance, which he

28:51.818 --> 28:55.482
would just pass on to us. So that wasn't a solution. 
And we had an armed jeep in the front of the convoy,

28:58.605 --> 29:06.413
an armed jeep in the rear of the convoy. This one was 
just diverted out and was gone before anybody

29:06.453 --> 29:13.920
could determine what happened. So there was a 
great deal of pressure to do something about it,

29:15.689 --> 29:23.503
especially from the contractual end to stop this. 
Until what we did was we looked at the rate of

29:24.484 --> 29:31.116
thievery on the New York waterfront.

29:33.644 --> 29:43.433
And for the volume handled, it was much more on the 
New York waterfront than it was in our little ports

29:33.644 --> 29:43.433
in Saigon. So the minute we pointed that up, that 
killed that. So the thievery wasn't that much. It

29:49.879 --> 29:54.023
was there, but they came to accept it as a cost of 
doing business. And it wasn't the real war

29:55.244 --> 30:02.571
material, which people would really be concerned 
if we were losing... weapons and that into the

30:02.973 --> 30:05.417
economy. But you weren't dealing with those 
weapons? Oh, yes. That was coming. Oh, yes. The

30:09.082 --> 30:12.266
weapons were on there, too, but they weren't 
taking the weapons. That's right. No, that's

30:12.667 --> 30:13.288
right. That's right. Because that would be 
readily convertible on the black market. At least

30:19.016 --> 30:27.048
we didn't have, at least that kind of problem 
wasn't highly visible. It wasn't highly visible.

30:28.690 --> 30:32.676
With the black market, goods that were readily 
purveyable on the black market Now you talked

30:33.314 --> 30:41.883
about, you said you had private contact with the 
Vietnamese people and you said that, you know, you

30:33.314 --> 30:41.883
thought they were really great people and 
everything. Do you think a lot of Americans over

30:42.443 --> 30:49.671
there, though, had some racism or sexism toward 
them? Maybe people you worked with? What you saw

30:52.834 --> 30:54.156
going on? Well, we saw them in a different context. 
You know, we saw them as... as human beings. And so

31:04.541 --> 31:30.473
I didn't see any there, but there's always a 
certain amount with the GIs, I would think, of

31:04.541 --> 31:30.473
coarse language, let's put it that way, towards 
nationals of other countries which we're in.

31:32.191 --> 31:42.182
I've never seen, I always took it upon, just 
something which was said to be said without any

31:32.191 --> 31:42.182
meaning. For example, you will hear people cuss, 
and they may say something like, God damn, but They

31:54.449 --> 31:55.410
don't mean it. It's just an expression. They don't 
mean that God should suddenly come down and damn

31:58.452 --> 32:01.915
someone. No one is that insensitive, or generally 
that insensitive. But they say it because it's

32:05.338 --> 32:14.306
something which they've learned to say or been 
accustomed to say as giving a feeling of

32:05.338 --> 32:14.306
irritability. And I think the same way with the GI. 
They might... They might...

32:23.474 --> 32:37.017
criticized the Vietnamese or looked derision 
upon one or two, but it wasn't, I didn't get the

32:23.474 --> 32:37.017
impression that it was really meant. It was really 
meant. I didn't see much of it and I didn't think it

32:38.019 --> 32:44.831
was really, really meant. Since you, you know, you 
weren't fulfilled and everything, but Was any of

32:47.605 --> 32:50.870
the herbal side of warfare going on around 
Cyclone? No, it wasn't mentioned while I was

32:50.890 --> 32:52.612
there. Oh, it wasn't even mentioned while you were 
there? No, I never heard anything about the Agent

32:54.255 --> 33:00.324
Orange or anything. No, I didn't. I didn't hear 
that. No. Didn't hear it going on. Well, when Nixon

33:08.516 --> 33:14.865
came into office in 69, you know, he wanted the war 
to be at an end. And he kept talking about having...

33:17.305 --> 33:18.427
a peace with honor. Could you see that as possible 
after everything that had gone on, that we could

33:19.028 --> 33:25.358
have peace with honor? As far from my position in 
79, there wasn't any slacking of any effort. Oh, in

33:32.328 --> 33:33.070
69? No, I didn't see any slacking of any effort in 69 
or 70. I didn't see any signs of any regression

33:38.218 --> 33:40.461
there. I mean, if you would have said to me, asked me 
from my vantage point at 69, did I see any peace

33:41.217 --> 33:56.998
overtures or feel that there was... Did you feel 
that Anne was coming to a near? No. You didn't? No,

33:58.240 --> 33:59.842
no, no, no. At that time, I thought I'd be back 
again. Oh, you thought you... In other words, hey,

34:04.388 --> 34:07.292
I didn't think, I think it'd be still going. Right. 
Well, even like when Wes Moreland was talking

34:08.151 --> 34:13.138
about that by 68 we'd be finished. You don't think 
people... Well, I was there at 69. I don't know.

34:19.608 --> 34:20.649
Let's see. He was there when I was there. I thought 
Abrams was there. Abrams was there when you were

34:24.315 --> 34:26.077
there. Yeah. I saw him once or twice. Oh, you did see 
him? Yeah.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.439
What was he like? No personal association. Oh, 
very nice gentleman. Very nice. They're usually

34:39.527 --> 34:41.009
quiet. They're not boisterous. I didn't meet 
Westmoreland there. I met Westmoreland in

34:44.634 --> 34:46.697
Vietnam. Not Vietnam, Thailand. Oh, so you had 
been with him before. In Thailand. He was in

34:51.384 --> 34:53.407
Vietnam when I was in Thailand. I was in Thailand in 
64. He was in Vietnam, I believe, at that time. So he

34:58.996 --> 35:00.718
came and visited Thailand. So I was in 69. Oh, but 
there was no, you felt that you were going to maybe

35:03.561 --> 35:10.030
be back for another time? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, 
yeah. I didn't see any end of it there. Okay. Well,

35:16.337 --> 35:24.888
do you feel like by not having ever declared a war, 
that this really hindered our involvement? Not

35:24.988 --> 35:27.211
from the level I was at. Not from where you were? No, 
no, no. No. No, I didn't see it hinder anything that

35:30.604 --> 35:33.829
we wanted to do. Now, of course, if you were to 
declare a war, what you might have done, you might

35:34.610 --> 35:43.002
have put more emphasis, put more stuff into the 
country on it. Because remember that, as I said,

35:44.605 --> 35:54.359
the engineering

35:44.605 --> 35:54.359
services was performed by contractors. And I 
think that was designed probably to make more

35:57.145 --> 36:00.148
troops available for military duties. Now, so 
that was a restraint. That was at least the

36:05.614 --> 36:16.687
perceived restraint, which certainly wouldn't 
have been in effect if there was a war on it. So I

36:16.707 --> 36:26.798
didn't think we were, well,

36:16.707 --> 36:26.798
from my perspective, it looked like we were. 
putting in as much as we monitored there. But there

36:29.308 --> 36:35.076
were these personnel restraints, so perhaps we 
couldn't field as many divisions and put as much

36:29.308 --> 36:35.076
strain. So maybe from a higher viewpoint, there 
was a hindrance because there wasn't a declared

36:35.096 --> 36:45.210
war. But I think that only affected, I would think 
that if there was more popular support at home, for

36:53.913 --> 37:00.603
the Vietnamese campaign, there probably would 
have been, it wouldn't have made a difference. No,

37:00.844 --> 37:03.027
it wouldn't have made a difference. Whether they 
call it a war or something else. If it was popular

37:04.870 --> 37:07.334
support, they would have did more. I guess they 
felt that there was some restraint. Well, from the

37:11.961 --> 37:21.996
Vietnam War as a whole, what lessons do you feel the 
U.S. Army learned from getting involved in such a

37:11.961 --> 37:21.996
long war to get going? Well, I think what we learned 
was that

37:22.398 --> 37:36.579
you need, to run a campaign like that, you need a lot 
of support personnel for every frontline troop

37:22.398 --> 37:36.579
you have. It takes a lot of support personnel to 
keep a guy out on the line. So I think, I don't know

37:43.409 --> 37:47.275
what our force was over there. But I wouldn't be a 
bit surprised at all to find out that we had maybe

37:49.620 --> 37:57.011
three to one support personnel to combat 
personnel. Trigger pullers, as they call them.

37:59.074 --> 37:59.535
Trigger pullers. But of the other things we did, we 
certainly did a tremendous job with the medical

38:00.256 --> 38:09.249
services.

38:12.414 --> 38:14.697
In fact,

38:15.773 --> 38:33.656
I don't think that there is an unknown soldier from 
Vietnam just because the scientific

38:15.773 --> 38:33.656
has been so advanced that we'd be able to pull 
somebody out or else if we couldn't pull them out,

38:15.773 --> 38:33.656
we were able to get the remains and identify them. 
But I forget what, they had one startling

38:33.676 --> 38:42.287
statistic about if you were hit and you got to that 
helicopter, Uh, very rarely would you get lost.

38:45.785 --> 38:47.007
Very rarely would you get lost. The medical 
services were so good. Did you have, did you get,

38:50.172 --> 38:57.304
um, much contact with the truth, the guy that was 
actually on the line? No, no. No? I really don't.

39:00.589 --> 39:05.237
Hey, when I visited those installations on the 
outlying... By the co-workers? That's right.

39:06.618 --> 39:10.322
When I would visit them to see how the contracts 
were doing, I would. But if you say, hey, how many

39:10.562 --> 39:19.911
times was I under mortis, mortar attack, you know, 
you could count them on one hand. Oh, so you weren't

39:19.931 --> 39:21.933
in one fire. No, no, no, no, no, no. With Saigon, 
maybe we'd get involved with a terrorist incident

39:25.477 --> 39:30.321
here and there. Do you think that was always North 
Vietnamese? Was that, I mean, some of the South

39:34.165 --> 39:35.106
Vietnamese? I really don't know. The one we saw, we 
had one incident. All the stuff was sandbagged on

39:41.592 --> 39:53.362
the lower quarters because what they would do is 
ride along on a scooter.

39:53.443 --> 39:58.067
Yes, with a young lady on the back usually. And when 
you'd be standing at the bus stop or something and

39:59.088 --> 40:05.093
they'd throw the hand grenade or the satchel 
charge at you. And so they had all these sandbags

40:05.647 --> 40:17.160
and that to protect the building, and you could 
jump behind and the rest of it. And right outside

40:17.180 --> 40:19.803
the agency, we had one go off. And what it was, it 
went off in the hand and blew the person in half.

40:26.932 --> 40:31.317
That's how I know that relatively young people 
involved. And we had the hotel where I was attacked

40:36.325 --> 40:37.887
Oh, when you were there in Hotonga? Yeah. And 
everybody pulled duty officer each... I guess it

40:43.995 --> 40:45.076
came about...

40:48.100 --> 40:51.945
I guess it came about once a month you pulled it, all 
night. You stood outside and there was a little

40:52.265 --> 41:02.198
barricade and you had a pistol and somebody had an 
M16 and you just walked around the street just...

41:02.735 --> 41:08.662
just to guard the sleeping people in case there was 
an attack on the hotel. But there was an attack on

41:10.084 --> 41:13.308
the hotel I was there. It blew out all the windows. 
We were very, very lucky. What happened was a

41:17.353 --> 41:27.966
couple of young boys, really young, were pushing a 
baby carriage And on this baby carriage, they had

41:28.739 --> 41:38.291
cigarettes and chewing gum, like a little vendor. 
And they were pushing it towards the hotel down a

41:40.053 --> 41:48.363
side street. And we had the guard there with the M16 
there, and he was like in a little cement

41:48.383 --> 41:56.012
barricade. And when the kids got close to the 
hotel, the guard said, stop, stop. And at that

42:07.838 --> 42:13.083
time, one of the kids reached down and pulled out a 
satchel charge. I figured it was about a pound and a

42:13.123 --> 42:19.209
half of plastic. And he threw it at the guard. Well, 
that put the guard fell down behind his barricade

42:26.840 --> 42:31.588
because he saw that charge coming. And while the 
charge was coming, the kids then ran away. Now, the

42:37.638 --> 42:43.948
charge went off, blew out all the windows, just 
every window that faced that street in that hotel.

42:44.208 --> 42:45.190
Just blew them all out. Were you in your room? No, I 
was downstairs. I was there. Just blew them all

42:48.976 --> 42:50.178
out. And the kids... They freeze and they threw the 
charge to get the guard down and to make their

42:54.143 --> 42:58.267
escape. And they made their escape. But the little 
baby carriage didn't explode. See, they had 60

43:08.117 --> 43:10.840
pounds of tin. Oh, they had that whole thing? Yes. 
What was it in there? It was 60 pounds of plastic

43:14.664 --> 43:18.648
explosive. And it was in a shaped charge, but it was 
packed into a helmet. And the helmet was faced

43:24.029 --> 43:25.671
forward. So they wanted to focus the blast, and 
that's what do it, at the building. And the

43:33.480 --> 43:36.003
detonator didn't go off. Well, these young 
children, were they making these bombs? I

43:42.630 --> 43:43.431
wouldn't know. Probably not. Probably not. And 
they weren't, well, you know, when you say young,

43:47.485 --> 43:57.138
from the guy, he said he looked like 15, maybe 16, 
you know. But you really can't tell, you know, what

43:57.859 --> 44:05.610
maybe 15 or 16 to him might be 23 to you or me. But they 
were probably a little young. But the little girl

44:08.313 --> 44:15.383
on the motorcycle and her friend that gets blown up 
when the thing blew up prematurely,

44:17.658 --> 44:20.903
They looked young, but they wanted children. Were 
there a lot of kids running around? Oh, yeah, yeah.

44:24.327 --> 44:26.190
What were the children like? Oh, great. You've 
never seen such love and affection as bestowed by

44:27.292 --> 44:35.623
Vietnamese on their children. I mean, it's 
really... They never raised their hand to the

44:38.447 --> 44:40.190
children. They worshipped the ground the 
children walked on. They're very solicitous of

44:43.895 --> 44:47.580
the children. a great deal of demonstrable love 
and affection. Well, did a lot of refugees come to

44:51.741 --> 44:55.325
Saigon? Yes, they did. They did, but you never saw 
them as refugees. Where I came in contact with the

44:59.289 --> 45:08.980
refugees was, one thing you, which was hard to get 
used to, the kids stayed up and played to all hours

44:59.289 --> 45:08.980
of the night. In other words, you would be coming 
back from work at 7, 8 o'clock, whatever it is, and

45:09.440 --> 45:15.627
the kids would be out there playing. They played 
just at night. But the parents were always there

45:18.760 --> 45:22.485
and watching, not unsupervised or anything. But I 
think that was really very impressive. He said,

45:25.849 --> 45:31.796
these are very fine people, the way they love their 
children, and demonstrated it. But the refugees

45:31.816 --> 45:43.290
where I came in contact with the refugees were 
several

45:31.816 --> 45:43.290
contractors employed them. And we had one 
Catholic priest. who took these refugees to them,

45:46.150 --> 45:53.720
worked them into a business, and they were doing 
laundry and selling produce. Was this Catholic

45:54.280 --> 45:56.263
priest a Vietnamese? No, I think he was French. Oh, 
he was French. I think a lot came from the North. As I

46:03.452 --> 46:09.460
said, the secretary I had working for me came from 
the North originally.

46:11.743 --> 46:15.988
Her father was a Vietnamese army officer. and came 
down south. I think he was done. Well, did these

46:21.738 --> 46:28.246
South Vietnamese, did they talk about the North 
Vietnamese or the different people, or were they

46:21.738 --> 46:28.246
all Vietnamese? It was never discussed. Oh, it was 
never discussed. Never discussed. I never had

46:31.590 --> 46:34.033
that sort of conversation with them. With the 
Arvin troops that I came into contact with, you

46:34.213 --> 46:40.961
just didn't ask them, you know what I mean? Right. 
As they say, it would have been politicking again.

46:45.155 --> 46:46.718
They would think you were trying to pry. They did 
not want to pry. That's right. Well, let me ask you

46:48.861 --> 46:50.665
one thing about the children. Did we have some kind 
of education? What kind of education did they have

46:52.889 --> 46:55.874
over there for the children? I really don't... Oh 
yes, they did have a... The other thing was, it was

47:01.484 --> 47:04.690
very much like Thailand. At least what I saw, there 
was some educational program and it was

47:05.699 --> 47:16.198
regimented in the sense that the kids would go to 
school and they have their little uniforms.

47:18.301 --> 47:29.361
And it reminded me very much of the little uniforms 
we wore or I wore when I went to parochial school 50

47:18.301 --> 47:29.361
years ago. The little boys wore a white shirt and 
blue trousers, and the little girls wore a white

47:30.505 --> 47:39.874
blouse.
