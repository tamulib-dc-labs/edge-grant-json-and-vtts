00:04.334 --> 00:17.106
As we talk about the talent that the College of 
Education has and has enjoyed and the fact that the

00:04.334 --> 00:17.106
college is attracting really top quality people 
in reading and in a lot of the areas. Well, and top

00:18.927 --> 00:20.629
students too. Sure. Where is the motivation 
primarily from to get these people to really reach

00:21.289 --> 00:30.197
their highest potential if they're not already 
doing so? Well, I think we have some. I think we have

00:34.102 --> 00:42.050
a lot of outstanding people, and I think we have 
some people who are pretty close to reaching their

00:34.102 --> 00:42.050
potential. I'm not sure if anybody ever reaches 
their full potential, but I think we have some that

00:42.070 --> 00:49.218
are doing it. But I think that as a college, maybe 
not so much as individuals, but more as a college,

00:58.250 --> 01:11.702
or as groups or as programs to gain national 
visibility in certain areas of research and

00:58.250 --> 01:11.702
recognition, I don't think we're reaching our 
potential there. I think we're doing a good job. I

01:13.343 --> 01:15.005
think we're recognized as a good school. But I 
don't think we're reaching our potential there.

01:17.427 --> 01:20.570
And what could you see as the solution to that 
dilemma? I mean, how do you see that changing?

01:23.292 --> 01:27.936
Well, I think if we're going to change it, I think 
we're going to have to set some incentives or some

01:23.292 --> 01:27.936
reasons Why? What would be some incentives that 
you think would provide the right motivation?

01:36.589 --> 01:48.646
Well, set some goals and some program development 
or research goals or collaborative goals and tie

01:36.589 --> 01:48.646
it to salary increases and set some. There have to 
be some incentives. I mean, if I'm going to get my

01:50.369 --> 01:56.978
salary no matter what I do, you know, and you're on a 
12-month contract, wife, Why should I go out here

01:57.245 --> 02:01.930
and I'm going to do what I want to do because this is 
what I'm interested in. And I think to a certain

02:01.950 --> 02:05.594
extent you ought to have that in a university. But I 
think that we're going to have to have some, we're

02:05.614 --> 02:11.841
going to have to set some goals and I think we're 
going to have to develop some incentives. Okay.

02:12.021 --> 02:20.670
Let's talk about that for just a second because 
part of this organizational behavior and

02:12.021 --> 02:20.670
decision making and so forth, setting goals is the 
first one of any of them. How are goals set for the

02:21.241 --> 02:24.625
College of Education? Is it done strictly by 
department or is there goals for the whole deal?

02:29.450 --> 02:37.639
Well, I think that's an area that we need to be 
working on to set goals and improve our planning

02:29.450 --> 02:37.639
process. And I wouldn't say that that's so much a 
fault of the colleges of the university. I think

02:44.606 --> 02:46.388
that now they're starting with a new chancellor 
and everything, they're starting a planning

02:46.908 --> 02:51.774
process now. And I think that if they do it 
correctly, then it could be a good experience.

02:58.322 --> 03:01.966
There was a study a few years back called the Target 
2000. That was basically a goal-setting type

03:02.267 --> 03:05.791
project. Have the goals that the College of 
Education set at that time been reached and have

03:05.811 --> 03:11.818
they been evaluated? to see where we are compared 
to where the... I'm not aware that they have, so

03:15.700 --> 03:17.903
yeah. We talked about it at the Development 
Council meeting about going back to see where we

03:17.923 --> 03:21.788
are from... I think that would be a good idea, yeah. 
I think that would be a good idea. Okay. You've been

03:27.576 --> 03:30.961
at Texas A&M now for 17 years? 17 years. And so I'm 
sure that, like everybody else, you have your own

03:32.503 --> 03:42.818
little crystal ball as to where you see there's 
some dramatic things coming up that are going to

03:32.503 --> 03:42.818
affect the College of Education and the 
legislature. has its way and so forth. What do you

03:45.464 --> 03:47.747
think this college is going to become? What is 
going to become of the college and how will it be

03:48.307 --> 03:51.711
affected in your opinion? Well, I'm not really 
sure my crystal ball is too clear right now. One

03:59.058 --> 04:07.667
thing I'm concerned about is what's going to 
happen to teacher education and colleges of

03:59.058 --> 04:07.667
education in the state. I think we still don't know 
what the fallout is of 994 And I'm concerned about

04:12.616 --> 04:14.599
that. I know the dean, and I know a lot of people are. 
And I think that there's a lot of uneasiness among

04:17.683 --> 04:27.758
faculty in the college right now, wondering 
about, you know, we're going to a five-year

04:17.683 --> 04:27.758
program. You have this 18-hour requirement, or, 
you know, the undergraduate degrees and teacher

04:28.279 --> 04:37.292
education have more than 18 hours in education. 
And they're still waiting for the...

04:41.675 --> 05:05.164
coordinating board and TEA to interpret that and I 
think we're trying to be positive about it and that

04:41.675 --> 05:05.164
though obviously Dean Corrigan and a lot of the key 
people in teacher education think it's important

04:41.675 --> 05:05.164
that we go to a five-year program but there is still 
the possibility that the coordinating board

04:41.675 --> 05:05.164
could limit the ability of the colleges to do that. 
Why will that decision be? It's my understanding

05:08.669 --> 05:10.551
that that some of these decisions are in the 
process of being made now and that we might at least

05:10.750 --> 05:20.979
have some fairly definitive information about 
the first part of December. Because you have to set

05:20.999 --> 05:26.144
and plan for the classes for next year and what's 
going to happen. I'm really concerned about our

05:26.164 --> 05:29.507
legislators and the image. Obviously, our 
college has a good image in the state, but I'm

05:30.328 --> 05:40.437
really concerned about the image of education and 
colleges of education have in the state when you

05:30.328 --> 05:40.437
have legislature passing a bill like that, it's 
obviously a pretty poor image. And he pushed it, or

05:47.722 --> 05:58.158
even added to the legislation, or even 
interpreted that legislation very strictly, and

05:47.722 --> 05:58.158
it could put colleges and education out of 
business. How did that come about? How did that

05:59.380 --> 06:02.625
even come to the front? Well, I think that there are 
people, and I think it's a misunderstanding, I

06:03.126 --> 06:09.175
think it's a problem on both parts. I think that 
there are poor teacher education programs across

06:09.577 --> 06:13.142
the state. Well, how would you define a poor 
teacher education program? Well, you know, that

06:18.709 --> 06:29.343
they don't have very many quality standards and 
that they're very lax on the students that they let

06:18.709 --> 06:29.343
in the teacher education programs. And the 
preparation there isn't a lot, in terms of

06:30.324 --> 06:38.655
especially the education courses, there isn't a 
lot of substance to the courses. You've heard the

06:39.817 --> 06:44.502
Mickey Mouse education courses and things of this 
nature. And there are programs like that. So I

06:48.386 --> 06:50.508
think that's one thing that has contributed to it. 
I think the other thing that has contributed to it

06:50.868 --> 06:58.536
is a lack of information or being unwilling to 
listen. Because in current teacher education

06:58.576 --> 07:07.866
programs, students aren't taking a lot of hours in 
education anyway. subject matter courses and

07:08.470 --> 07:38.427
there's a lot and we need to communicate and I guess 
as educators we don't communicate very well but

07:08.470 --> 07:38.427
there's a lot more to teaching than just knowing 
the subject matter I think you have to really know

07:08.470 --> 07:38.427
the subject matter and you have to be in courses 
that are very demanding but I also think there's a

07:08.470 --> 07:38.427
there's a methodology there's a pedagogy there's 
information relating to understanding kids you

07:08.470 --> 07:38.427
know growth and development and the whole thing 
testing there's all this and and so i think there's

07:38.862 --> 08:06.642
a misconceptions on both i think there's some poor 
programs that need to be cleaned up and i think also

07:38.862 --> 08:06.642
that the legislature and the public isn't aware we 
need to tell our story a little better that's right

07:38.862 --> 08:06.642
that's right that's right so i don't know i think 
that uh i'm concerned i'm concerned about what uh

07:38.862 --> 08:06.642
what the future might hold now i've been a teacher 
and a high school counselor before I came to A&M,

08:06.875 --> 08:18.652
and I have about 12 years of public school 
experience, so I have quite a bit of public school

08:06.875 --> 08:18.652
experience, although it's been a few years since 
I've been out there. But I'm not a teacher

08:18.672 --> 08:22.477
educator. I mean, I have the public school 
experience, but I'm not a teacher educator. My

08:26.883 --> 08:36.797
area is counseling, and so I'm very interested in 
teacher education, and I've had the public school

08:26.883 --> 08:36.797
experience, but I am not a teacher educator. Some 
of these things I'm kind of looking at and I'm

08:37.368 --> 08:45.350
involved and I'm concerned about them, but some of 
them I'm not intimately involved in. Now let's

08:46.353 --> 08:50.926
look a little bit about what you feel in your years 
at A&M. You have contributed in your own special

08:52.758 --> 09:03.355
way, or maybe even through some of the insights or 
observations that you've made, and everybody's

08:52.758 --> 09:03.355
reluctant to talk about what they've done, and 
somebody said, well, you need to find that out from

08:52.758 --> 09:03.355
somebody else. Let them say what I have done. But 
what do you feel the best about, since you've been

09:04.818 --> 09:09.005
at A&M, that you've been involved in? Well, for a 
number of years, I came out of soft money position,

09:11.809 --> 09:19.542
and I was very involved in funded research and 
about 70s or about 78 when I became department head

09:20.888 --> 09:29.498
and didn't have really the time to concentrate on 
that anymore. I had a funded research project

09:29.538 --> 09:36.207
every year or sometimes several of them. So that 
was exciting and I enjoyed that. So I would say that

09:38.509 --> 09:49.022
I was probably one of the people early on in the 
college, not the only one because there were a lot

09:38.509 --> 09:49.022
of others, but I was one of those who was out there 
trying to get external funds. I would say another

09:49.694 --> 10:04.872
thing that I would, in terms of department heads, 
and what I did when I was a department head,

09:49.694 --> 10:04.872
is the APA accreditation in the Ed Psych 
department for Conacyt Psych. They had been

10:05.692 --> 10:14.082
talking about it for a number of years and saying, 
well, we're going to get a self-study together,

10:05.692 --> 10:14.082
we're going to bring in a consultant. And one of my 
main goals was to quit talking about And to me, I

10:20.963 --> 10:26.650
don't take the full credit for it, but in terms of 
leadership, I do. APA accreditation is the?

10:29.273 --> 10:32.177
American Psychological Association. And that's 
a very key, very selective type thing. When was

10:36.662 --> 10:37.323
that? The first APA accreditation for the 
counseling psych program was in 1980. And does

10:43.671 --> 10:45.393
that have to be renewable every? Every five years. 
And the other thing that I really liked about it,

10:46.613 --> 10:58.013
that I think the faculty and students, everybody 
was pleased about, is usually when you go up for

10:46.613 --> 10:58.013
accreditation the first time, you don't get full 
accreditation. You usually get three years and

10:58.053 --> 11:04.444
probationary, or conditional, I think it's 
conditional. And we got full five years and full

11:04.945 --> 11:10.815
accreditation the first time. lots of major 
universities across the country that didn't get

11:11.167 --> 11:14.672
that. So that was very pleasing to me. And then 
also, I think, before I stepped out of the

11:16.575 --> 11:29.152
department head's position, I think that I had 
helped set the groundwork for moving towards

11:16.575 --> 11:29.152
accreditation for a school site. And I guess the 
other thing, too, that I tried to do as a department

11:31.275 --> 11:35.942
head was to

11:39.888 --> 11:48.518
cut back on the faculty load to get faculty more 
time to do research and work with students, and cut

11:39.888 --> 11:48.518
back on the number of courses that they teach. What 
is the average, and what's too much? Well, in terms

11:52.022 --> 11:54.564
of graduate courses, two graduate courses. Is 
about average? Right. In ed psych. It is in some of

11:59.450 --> 12:02.233
the other, but in ed psych. What size classes are 
they usually? Well, graduate courses usually run

12:05.096 --> 12:08.460
10 to 15 students apiece. And are there any special 
insights or anecdotes or things? One of the things

12:15.089 --> 12:20.456
that you're doing now in this position is working 
with the Development Council as part of your

12:15.089 --> 12:20.456
office. I only have one other person that's been 
involved in the Development Council, and that's

12:21.297 --> 12:29.247
Don Clark, who was in your position when this thing 
got started. Can you give me just a little bit of a

12:29.607 --> 12:36.996
couple of insights about your association with 
the Development Council and what you think that

12:37.955 --> 12:46.564
particular entity is doing or should do or has done 
to assist the College of Education in any way?

12:46.584 --> 12:49.587
Well, I think the role of the Development Council 
is changing. I think initially it was put together

12:49.707 --> 13:01.458
more as an advisory group, and I think that there's 
more pressure to go after funding. And it isn't all

13:01.538 --> 13:03.280
from the college. I think some of it's coming 
external to the college, like from the provost's

13:06.710 --> 13:11.755
office and the president's office, and there's a 
lot of competitiveness there. And so I think that

13:12.396 --> 13:16.621
the role of the development council is changing. 
But it has given me an opportunity to meet some—and

13:17.462 --> 13:25.991
I'm not—you are, but I don't mean—I'm not—but to 
meet some real fine people. I don't want to sound

13:26.031 --> 13:28.033
patronizing. No, no. But it has. It has given me an 
opportunity to meet a lot of really fine people and

13:30.476 --> 13:36.362
interesting people. and get involved in meeting a 
lot of former students and people in business and

13:36.798 --> 13:50.199
industry that, you know, as a faculty member you 
would typically, or even as an administrator, you

13:36.798 --> 13:50.199
might not have as much of an opportunity to meet. 
Okay, now that you mention this, as an

13:50.820 --> 13:58.612
administrator, can you just give me a little bit of 
insight into the eighth floor of the College of

13:50.820 --> 13:58.612
Education? I visit up there frequently, but what 
is the mechanism You know, I know it's a huge

14:03.595 --> 14:23.573
organization, and there's a lot of 
decision-making, but I don't have a feel as an

14:03.595 --> 14:23.573
outsider, and not having worked, I've never been 
to a faculty meeting, I don't know what is the

14:03.595 --> 14:23.573
decision-making process, and what actually 
happens up there as it affects the whole college.

14:23.653 --> 14:31.020
Well, there are two different levels, or I mean, 
maybe the same level, but there's a dean and his

14:23.653 --> 14:31.020
staff, and... it would consist of two associate 
deans, Brian Cohen, myself, and David Davis,

14:31.338 --> 14:40.526
assistant dean, and then our business person, 
Larry Dooling. And we meet maybe not every Monday

14:41.247 --> 14:56.081
in case some of us are out of town, but we usually 
meet every Monday morning with the dean to go

14:41.247 --> 14:56.081
through our calendars and just go through 
different things that are coming up that week or in

14:41.247 --> 14:56.081
the future. And then we also, each of us have 
bi-weekly meetings with the dean in about an hour

15:01.139 --> 15:06.066
to kind of go through and discuss things 
individually. And we have special meetings from

15:06.547 --> 15:08.370
time to time. Then the other process, 
decision-making process and direction, we have

15:08.710 --> 15:19.947
what we call a policy committee, which consists of 
all the department heads and the dean staff, and

15:08.710 --> 15:19.947
it's chaired by the dean. And that meets the first 
Tuesday, the first and third Tuesday of every

15:20.468 --> 15:25.636
month. And occasionally there's a call meeting, 
but that's when that meets.

15:32.712 --> 15:41.863
I would say that a lot of the, that's where the 
decision making and whole process evolves. In

15:42.424 --> 15:53.257
Corrigan, there's

15:42.424 --> 15:53.257
a lot more participation and more of a democratic 
type leadership. There certainly is a very

15:54.919 --> 15:58.603
distinct difference between the two styles. Is 
there a lot of autonomy? I want to say that the

16:03.104 --> 16:22.819
different associate deans and the different 
people on the eighth floor, as far as everybody

16:03.104 --> 16:22.819
having very specific deals, are you responsible 
for certain areas only and though the decisions

16:03.104 --> 16:22.819
come directly from you or directly from Brian Cole 
or directly from David David or whoever is in that

16:03.104 --> 16:22.819
position? The dean likes to give us, to run our, I 
mean we're staff people. But he likes to, we have

16:28.147 --> 16:32.353
certain responsibilities. So for example, can 
you just give me some of the things, I know the

16:32.793 --> 16:36.518
development council is one of yours. What are some 
of the other things of your particular? Well,

16:39.462 --> 16:49.876
development council, development, external 
funding, all proposals, any funding

16:39.462 --> 16:49.876
opportunities, all that goes through my office. 
Graduate studies goes through my office. So I'm

16:53.642 --> 16:55.504
chair of the College Graduate Instruction 
Committee, which I represent from each

16:55.923 --> 17:04.250
department, and all new course proposals or 
anything related to graduate study goes through

16:55.923 --> 17:04.250
my office. And then since I'm chair of the College 
Graduate Instruction Committee, I'm also a

17:04.710 --> 17:11.196
member of the University Graduate Council. Which 
does what? It reviews all new course proposals and

17:14.058 --> 17:20.264
anything relating to graduate study. And do those 
course proposals come from the department heads

17:21.044 --> 17:25.288
to you first? Can I take them to the graduate 
instruction committee in the college or review

17:25.910 --> 17:32.039
them? And then if we pass on them, we might ask them 
to change a little bit, and then it's in accordance

17:32.740 --> 17:40.291
with our recommendation, and he sends it out to the 
graduate office. There was a comment made about

17:41.573 --> 17:50.806
the fact that, of course, the funding to the 
College of Education comes from courses and from

17:41.573 --> 17:50.806
student hours. That's what generates the largest 
amount of funds. Is that correct? And that a lot of

17:54.783 --> 18:12.182
times, we're trying to get more courses so that I 
can teach more students, so that we can, in other

17:54.783 --> 18:12.182
words, the expression was something about we can 
become a dinosaur, just trying to add more courses

17:54.783 --> 18:12.182
so that we can have more classes. Is that a 
different type of perception? Well, I think some

18:15.025 --> 18:24.435
departments and some programs, I think we have to 
look at the number of students and the number of

18:15.025 --> 18:24.435
things we're doing and the areas that we're trying 
to do too much. By trying to do too much . Well, for

18:28.978 --> 18:34.526
instance, we have a large graduate program in the 
college. I'm just talking about the specific

18:35.027 --> 18:37.650
department. And I think for the number of faculty 
that some departments have, they've just taken on

18:37.670 --> 18:42.618
too many graduate students. And I think that to do 
an adequate job, they need to cut back. I mean, for

18:49.608 --> 18:54.034
instance, I think the graduate courses, I think an 
ideal size to really interact do research and

18:55.988 --> 19:03.258
write courses and have the dialogue that you need, 
I think should be, at the most, 10 to 15 students.

19:03.338 --> 19:07.404
And I mean, there are graduate courses that are a 
lot larger than that. And I really question that in

19:08.245 --> 19:12.571
terms of that. Yeah. I mean, then, because it's 
growing so and there's so much more demand for

19:12.731 --> 19:21.483
these courses, is there a need to just get more 
faculty? Well. That's one way you can go, but you

19:24.406 --> 19:29.073
can also get so big that the thing gets kind of 
unwielding. Plus, I don't think the chances are

19:29.153 --> 19:36.545
real good now with the economic conditions that we 
have in the state and the funding that we have. I

19:36.705 --> 19:39.970
don't think the conditions are good that we're 
going to get a lot more faculty. I really think that

19:40.030 --> 19:44.878
what we need to do is be looking at quality. And I'm 
not saying we don't have quality, but I think we

19:44.898 --> 19:50.987
need to be cutting back in some areas.

19:53.296 --> 19:57.001
shouldn't be chairing more than four or five 
doctoral students apiece. And I felt that for a

19:58.042 --> 20:03.229
long time, and I think that we need to come back 
there. And who makes those kinds of decisions?

20:04.931 --> 20:08.035
Like, do you feel like some faculty would— Well, 
the individual departments and faculty do. And we

20:08.476 --> 20:11.860
came across—we came out with it. We had a joint 
committee of our graduate instruction committee

20:11.900 --> 20:21.733
and steering committee on inquiry that developed 
a paper, and we had input from faculty and

20:11.900 --> 20:21.733
students. It's called—I think it's How to Improve 
Doctoral Research or something. And there's a

20:26.443 --> 20:34.212
whole set of recommendations in there, and one of 
them is to cut back on the number of students we have

20:26.443 --> 20:34.212
in terms of graduates. Oh, you're talking about 
the College of Education following the Texas A&M

20:34.232 --> 20:38.637
cap? Well, maybe not quite that same way, but yeah. 
Okay, one of the things though, doesn't graduate

20:44.003 --> 20:49.729
hours generate a tremendous amount of money? But 
that's something that has changed quite a bit. In

20:54.560 --> 20:59.525
the 70s, the budget that we got, they were looking 
at it. They would look at the central

20:59.565 --> 21:05.872
administration and the dean's office would look 
at how many credit hours you generated. There

21:06.513 --> 21:09.356
isn't that pressure to do that anymore. Is that 
right? What changed that? I'm not sure, Sylvia. In

21:17.165 --> 21:22.472
our own college, it's just that we matured a little 
bit and we didn't worry about it that much anymore.

21:22.793 --> 21:26.238
Plus, I think the central administration just 
quit.

21:28.100 --> 21:29.122
Very good. Dr. Borman, I thank you very, very much 
for this interview, and I believe that you've

21:29.182 --> 21:37.333
given me some very valuable insights on the 
administrative end. This is my first

21:37.353 --> 21:39.156
administration interview.
