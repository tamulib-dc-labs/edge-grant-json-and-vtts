00:03.271 --> 00:09.463
Once those first semester midterm grades come 
out, reality sort of sticks in. So the pendulum

00:09.504 --> 00:11.327
starts to swing back. Say, wait a minute, I'm 
spending too much time over here doing all this

00:11.347 --> 00:19.704
other stuff that's not going to have any bearing on 
my life really at all. I mean, it will, but not as

00:20.185 --> 00:21.668
much. I better start putting my time in some books. 
So I stuck for the next three months. I worked real

00:25.808 --> 00:31.395
hard, managed to bring it up to about a C average I 
think at the end of the first semester. Then I got

00:31.875 --> 00:37.101
into the Texas Maritime business and that really, 
my life changed. Let's give us a break. Let's back

00:39.264 --> 00:40.325
up a little though. Fall semester, going to first 
football games. What was that like? Oh, that was

00:47.372 --> 00:48.813
awesome. The march in, I still get choked up when 
the flag comes by. I love parades. I still think

00:55.539 --> 01:03.767
that the Corps cadets at Texas A&M have the best 
drill of any place in the world. As a matter of fact,

01:03.847 --> 01:13.896
the Corps really reminds me, now that I've spent 32 
years in the Naval service and have dealt a lot with

01:03.847 --> 01:13.896
the Marines, my son-in-law is a Marine captain, 
that it's an awful lot like the Marine Corps. The

01:18.159 --> 01:26.386
camaraderie, the, you know, just the appearance 
and the way we march. If you look at any, all the

01:26.406 --> 01:33.773
academies, if you look at them when they come 
marching in, there's just no comparison in Texas

01:26.406 --> 01:33.773
A&M, none whatsoever. Did you and your buddies as 
fish, did you all try any good bull at games? I'm

01:42.541 --> 01:43.782
trying to think. You know, we were pretty 
straight, I think. I don't recall, you know, we

01:46.083 --> 01:56.535
were always, you know, we'd have beer and that kind 
of stuff, but, you know, we'd have dates, you know,

01:46.083 --> 01:56.535
but I don't recall. Did you have dates as a 
freshman? Not here at the campus, but, you know,

01:59.758 --> 02:10.110
when we'd go to march-ins and things, there was 
always a guy that was from that part of the town,

01:59.758 --> 02:10.110
and, you know, he'd introduce us to some gals, and, 
you know, they always liked to see guys in

01:59.758 --> 02:10.110
uniforms. That was still kind of popular. So I can 
remember... remember doing that. We had a guy

02:15.377 --> 02:22.984
named Jerry Buttrell was my executive officer in 
E2 and his sister was about my age. I remember going

02:23.004 --> 02:25.466
to Beaumont and visiting her. So it was fun 
fulfilled. I do recall though some other stuff.

02:33.714 --> 02:40.200
Sonny Cantanzaro had a, I want to say he had a Chevy, 
like a 56, 57 Chevy. And he was from Beaumont and

02:40.800 --> 02:43.603
just a wonderful guy. And I think he was the only one 
in our group that had a car. And so we'd get in his car

02:47.688 --> 03:02.504
and we'd manage to, I'm really telling stories 
here, we'd manage to get his ID or my ID or

02:47.688 --> 03:02.504
somebody's ID where you could move some numbers 
around, glue them back on, and it looked like you

02:47.688 --> 03:02.504
were 21. So we'd go out and buy those big bottles of 
beer, Pearl I think it was in those days. And I can

03:08.511 --> 03:09.912
remember going out here to, towards Navasota 
someplace, and we'd just pull off the side of the

03:11.225 --> 03:17.932
road and jump on the fence post there and sit there 
and drink that beer and tell stories and stuff. And

03:18.533 --> 03:21.396
there would be guys about every four or five miles 
doing that. Well, we were sitting there, we

03:21.456 --> 03:30.385
weren't, you know, we were not throwing the 
bottles around or anything, but evidently

03:21.456 --> 03:30.385
another crowd up the road was throwing bottles and 
the sheriff showed up, thought we were the ones

03:21.456 --> 03:30.385
doing it. And I can remember running out into the 
woods, hiding in a thistle, the guys walking

03:30.405 --> 03:34.650
around with the flashlight, He had the car, but he 
didn't have us. And, you know, he didn't do

03:37.098 --> 03:39.582
anything with the car. It was the dirtiest thing 
I've ever seen. I guess he didn't have a problem

03:40.884 --> 03:42.647
with cars or whatever. And we managed to get back 
and said, well, we've got to not do that again. So we

03:45.872 --> 03:48.456
started going out here to the Brazos and drinking. 
That was our little place. I remember jumping off

03:50.078 --> 03:52.923
the sand cliffs out there and that kind of stuff. At 
the football games, were the sophomores smoking

03:54.044 --> 03:59.393
cigars in those years? No, not that I recall. See, 
in other years, Big deal was sophomores smoked

04:02.407 --> 04:06.714
lots of cigars and blew the smoke in the freshman's 
face. I don't recall that. I don't recall that ever

04:07.656 --> 04:09.820
happening. Court trips as a freshman. Did you make 
those trips? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. What

04:14.969 --> 04:16.011
was it like? It was great fun. You know, four or five 
of us, six of us, eight of us, a hundred of us,

04:17.393 --> 04:23.183
however many we needed would chip in and get one 
room and... And again, we'd have dates, and it was

04:23.483 --> 04:28.717
just a lot of fun. Generally, as I recall, since my 
grandparents lived in Texas, that would give me a

04:28.978 --> 04:35.856
break to run up to Sherman. So I would just go up 
there, sometimes just do the game, and then run up

04:36.241 --> 04:44.689
to Sherman and spend the weekend up there. Because 
most of the time, it seemed to me like I spent a good

04:45.130 --> 04:50.735
deal of my time restricted, except for those kinds 
of things. Did you ever hitchhike? Oh,

04:52.937 --> 04:53.678
absolutely. In fact, I still have my bag. That's a 
good question. I have a Samsonite little

04:57.262 --> 05:01.085
overnight bag that's got Texas Aggies on it. Never 
had any problems hitchhiking. Never even thought

05:03.768 --> 05:04.729
about it. and until, you know, years later. And 
everybody stuck by the rules. You didn't up, you

05:11.083 --> 05:17.740
didn't try to, what was the slang word? where you 
would try to not upstage, but instead of being at

05:18.260 --> 05:26.254
the right place, you'd try to be upstream. 
Upstream? No, I don't recall any of that. It seems

05:29.480 --> 05:31.664
to me like you just walked out here, stuck your 
thumb out. Everybody was helpful. Yeah,

05:32.806 --> 05:33.748
everybody was helpful. It seems to me that, as I 
recall, Generally, it was hitchhiking to go from

05:36.232 --> 05:39.596
here to Galveston. You know, I remember my, Terry 
Archer and I, his grandparents lived down in Texas

05:39.616 --> 05:52.429
City, so we'd just go out here, and there weren't a 
lot of folks going that direction, it didn't seem

05:39.616 --> 05:52.429
like, and you'd just go out here and put your thumb 
out, and pretty soon somebody would come along and

05:39.616 --> 05:52.429
give you a ride down there. Alright, again, that 
first fall, do you remember going to Silver Taps

05:53.170 --> 05:56.734
the first time? Oh, yeah, that was, I do, and that, 
and it still is, we've done it, in fact, as a battle

05:57.094 --> 06:05.023
group commander, I got all the Aggies together on 
Kitty Hawk, or yeah, it was Kitty Hawk, and we had a

06:05.476 --> 06:30.454
muster, you know, right there on Kitty Hawk, which 
I think was, they showed it in some magazines or

06:05.476 --> 06:30.454
something, but yeah, that was really an 
eye-opener to me, you know, and I still get tears in

06:05.476 --> 06:30.454
my eyes when those kinds of things happen, because 
you really see what people have done, and you think

06:05.476 --> 06:30.454
about what they've done, and now, of course, as I As 
I get the magazine, I see that, you know, my

06:30.974 --> 06:36.282
classmates are starting to die and so forth. And, 
you know, it causes you to reflect a little bit.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.007
Bonfire. What did you do on Bonfire? Well, we, the F 
word, the trees, you know, went out and it seemed to

06:42.070 --> 06:47.438
me like the. About how long did y'all work on this? 
Oh, goodness. It was a, it, I want to, I mean, it went

06:50.542 --> 06:55.449
on forever, it seemed to me like. Of course, you 
know, time is funny in those days. I don't remember

06:57.612 --> 07:00.897
how many days it really took, but I can remember 
going out and, And out on the weekend, I mean, it

07:01.298 --> 07:05.110
felt like a military operation. We were all in our 
fatigues and go out and we'd carry the logs out and

07:05.130 --> 07:11.089
load them. and then come back and help them stack 
and of course as a fish you're just a gopher you know

07:11.373 --> 07:34.849
and then of course we had in those days we had 
foxholes and stuff out around the perimeter and we

07:11.373 --> 07:34.849
all had watches that we had to stand to make sure 
that you know nobody came in there and it was it was a

07:11.373 --> 07:34.849
military operation nobody ever tried to during 
your no i don't recall anybody trying at least not

07:11.373 --> 07:34.849
on not that i never heard i never heard of anybody 
trying to come in and light it but But gosh, you

07:35.285 --> 07:36.889
wouldn't want it to. And was this on Drillfield or 
Duncan? No, it was over behind Duncan. It was over

07:42.764 --> 07:44.148
behind Duncan. And I guess it seemed to me like 
that's where they'd held them for years. I guess

07:48.840 --> 07:50.965
about in the vicinity of the Bush Library, huh? No, 
no, no, Bush Library is way over here. Oh, way over

07:53.005 --> 07:53.685
here, okay. Well, it's over in that area. And were 
there any accidents that you remember? Oh, you

07:59.171 --> 08:06.459
know, people getting whacked by chainsaws and 
dropping, but nothing serious, getting

07:59.171 --> 08:06.459
splinters and that kind of stuff, but I don't 
recall any. You know, and I really thought we had,

08:07.279 --> 08:18.471
it looked to me like it was just a plan that had been 
executed year after year after year and had been

08:07.279 --> 08:18.471
handed down from Bubba to Bubba to Bubba, And of 
course, I do recall that we wanted to build it

08:18.839 --> 08:24.480
bigger than anybody else. But we didn't build it by 
stack. We built it by how tall we could get the

08:26.547 --> 08:29.558
center pole up. And so it was a little bit, you know, 
and I want to say it was only two tiers in those days.

08:36.572 --> 08:37.273
I think you're about right. And then we had this big 
tall, and I can remember a toilet sitting up at the

08:37.293 --> 08:41.941
top of it or something. And, but yeah, that was it. 
That, I recall that as being really a lot of fun. And

08:47.832 --> 08:52.440
it was hard work, but you're out in the woods, it was 
crisp, and, you know, Everybody, you know, it

08:52.690 --> 09:00.623
didn't matter who it was, freshman up through, you 
know, through the seniors. Everybody was

09:01.405 --> 09:04.149
involved, and we weren't getting yelled at a lot. 
You know, it was really a neat operation, I

09:04.410 --> 09:10.720
thought, very professionally done, as I recall. 
All right, and you go home Christmas, and when do

09:10.801 --> 09:15.829
you begin to feel... fairly sure you're not going 
to go somewhere else when did you quit oh that i i

09:15.809 --> 09:43.825
tell you what that happened uh that happened 
pretty early on because uh i i still sort of thought

09:15.809 --> 09:43.825
i was going to go to the naval academy and uh but uh 
but i got down here and i just i liked what i saw i

09:15.809 --> 09:43.825
wasn't happy with my grades that was kind of 
bothering me a little bit i went home and that and

09:15.809 --> 09:43.825
christmas didn't have a part in this my dad was 
stationed off it and uh right before we left for

09:15.809 --> 09:43.825
christmas vacation down here We were wearing the 
pinks and greens, and we had a horrible rain.

09:47.751 --> 09:51.781
Actually, it was at a football game, I guess it was. 
I didn't realize how that worsted wool would

09:52.964 --> 09:59.080
shrink, and that would be a sidelight to the 
stories, but keep that in mind. But basically, we

09:59.060 --> 10:12.201
put on our khakis and went out here, went up to 
Sherman, got on a train, Terry Archer and I did, and

09:59.060 --> 10:12.201
rode a train from Denison, Texas to Omaha, 
Nebraska, just a couple of seats. And as a matter of

10:12.561 --> 10:19.532
fact, there were some other kids on there from 
North Texas, some of the girls that we went to high

10:12.561 --> 10:19.532
school with in Bellevue. And then each year, of 
course, I had my uniform, my pinks and greens with

10:19.512 --> 10:26.821
me, because the officer's club always throws a 
party for all the military schools. But, gosh, I

10:27.462 --> 10:33.109
took mine out, put them on, and the daggum things 
were up around my knees, and we tried to stretch

10:27.462 --> 10:33.109
them. And I can remember having them way down low. 
Of course, with the blouse on, you couldn't see

10:35.132 --> 10:39.537
that they were low slung, you know, as long as you 
didn't get down with the pockets. I finally

10:39.557 --> 10:40.659
managed to get them down. But all my friends had 
gone to the Air Force Academy, the Naval Academy,

10:40.679 --> 10:44.523
West Point. They all showed up, and And it was, you 
know, they kind of looked down their nose a little

10:47.727 --> 10:51.393
bit at me. But I think once we told some stories, 
that all changed. But I had no intentions after

10:57.302 --> 11:01.889
that of ever leaving the system, the Texas A&M 
system. All right. And then now, describe how you

11:02.450 --> 11:12.246
shifted into the... Well, we had this friend of 
mine by the name of Bob Hedeman, who is now a harbor

11:02.450 --> 11:12.246
pilot up in Baltimore. And... Bob was in our 
company and a really nice guy. And one day I was

11:16.093 --> 11:20.205
talking about how I really wanted to get into the 
Navy and all that. He says, well, you know, there's

11:20.266 --> 11:27.066
a school starting up down in Galveston that's part 
of the Texas A&M system. And it's got Navy ROTC in

11:27.367 --> 11:32.295
it. I said, well, holy mackerel, that's what I want 
to do. And it's on the ocean, and yeah, we've got a

11:34.879 --> 11:37.383
training ship. In the summer of 65, it was going to 
be the first time the ship went to sea, the Texas

11:38.545 --> 11:43.954
Clipper. And it's a big passenger ship, and the 
cadets will do all the work on it and navigate it and

11:44.635 --> 11:51.045
operate it and all that. And I said, well, man, that 
sounds really neat. And I can get a commission.

11:54.638 --> 11:55.519
Yeah, you can get a commission. So I went down, 
talked to the folks. And of course, you went here

11:57.261 --> 12:00.767
the first year. Actually, I guess the first class 
went here the first two years and then went down

12:00.827 --> 12:03.651
there. So I changed my major the second semester. 
And officially it was named Marine

12:10.702 --> 12:14.186
Transportation. Well, officially it was named 
the Texas Maritime Academy. No, no, but the major.

12:17.769 --> 12:20.072
The major was Marine Transportation. Marine 
Engineering and Marine Transportation were the

12:20.112 --> 12:23.535
two degrees that you got. And so they took a look and 
they said, well, you know, you've got to really do

12:24.316 --> 12:38.110
some studying here because you've got to make up 
some Spanish and there were some other courses

12:24.316 --> 12:38.110
that they had, spherical trigonometry and things 
that have to do with navigation that I hadn't

12:24.316 --> 12:38.110
taken. But anyway, I got into it, and it really 
sparked my interest, and all of a sudden my

12:38.090 --> 12:46.503
academics went up. I guess the moral to the story is 
when you really figure out what it is you want to do,

12:47.024 --> 12:54.656
it just makes so much difference in the way you go 
about your business. So we got into it, and then...

12:57.099 --> 12:58.962
There was an application. It was just like 
changing a major because it was part of the system.

13:02.608 --> 13:05.312
And about when did you learn you'd been accepted? 
It was fairly quick. It was one of those deals that

13:06.853 --> 13:09.397
you kind of fall into. They were looking for folks. 
So it wasn't hard to do that. They were looking for

13:15.346 --> 13:16.288
people. Did any of your buddies, any of your outfit 
buddies, give you a hard time? Yeah, it was not.

13:21.536 --> 13:29.428
Some of them, I'm sure, thought it was, well, he's 
going to be here for just a few months and then he's

13:21.536 --> 13:29.428
going down to Galveston and we'll never see him 
again. Well, that's not true because we... The

13:31.752 --> 13:35.840
only thing we didn't do was reside in the same dorm, 
even though it was distance apart. We probably saw

13:35.860 --> 13:42.212
folks up here as much as a fellow does that lives in 
another dorm, or if you live on the other side of the

13:35.860 --> 13:42.212
school. We came up for all the march-ins. We wore 
Navy uniforms. In fact, we even tried to figure out

13:48.644 --> 13:56.740
a way to wear boots, you know, but it looked too 
Gestapo-like, so we didn't do that with a blue

13:48.644 --> 13:56.740
uniform. You finished the spring semester. And we 
wore a little different. We wore a Texas Maritime

14:00.348 --> 14:06.660
Academy patch, the same uniform, but the Texas 
Maritime Academy patch on it. But you finished the

14:06.680 --> 14:08.324
spring semester up here. Yes, sir. What did you do 
that summer? Well, that summer we went to school.

14:13.029 --> 14:13.590
We went down. We left here for about two weeks and 
drew all of our Navy uniforms, which we had to get

14:13.670 --> 14:27.419
tailored and all that, and then showed up down in 
Galveston in June, early June. They had just

14:27.981 --> 14:30.987
brought this ship called, it was the old 
Excambium, and they'd brought it in from the

14:30.967 --> 14:36.132
Boneyard and it was over in Todd's Shipyard in 
Galveston but it was a mess. That ship was an

14:36.252 --> 14:37.853
absolute mess. They'd put tar on the teak decks so 
it was just this gooey stuff. They hadn't put

14:41.716 --> 14:45.340
anything down to protect the decks so we were 
trying to do that. The engines were a mess. I can

14:46.861 --> 14:58.151
remember Bob Hederman and I then roomed together, 
the fellow that introduced me to this thing, and we

14:46.861 --> 14:58.151
had really a pretty nice stateroom on the ship but 
no air conditioning, no flow of air whatsoever.

14:58.211 --> 14:59.272
The toilets didn't work. The showers didn't work. 
It was literally a mess. Of course, they're making

15:02.715 --> 15:04.477
us wear whites and all this. Then they decided it 
was too hot to stay on the ship, so they bussed us

15:04.977 --> 15:12.344
over to Fort Crockett where the oceanography 
folks live. We had half of that building down there

15:12.364 --> 15:14.546
at Fort Crockett. They put army cots up on the 
breezeway on the second deck there. That's where

15:20.452 --> 15:21.493
we all started. How many were there in your... 
There were probably, I want to say about 30 of us.

15:27.818 --> 15:35.495
And it was like being a fish all over again because 
now you really expect to come in and be an

15:27.818 --> 15:35.495
upperclassman. Well, there wasn't any 
underclassmen. The juniors and seniors were

15:37.539 --> 15:43.532
just, you know, they had blood dripping from their 
from their mouths to get hold of us, so we went right

15:43.850 --> 15:56.548
back through another freshman year again, 
push-ups, set-ups, and, you know, it was a

15:43.850 --> 15:56.548
complete freshman year again, as far as I, not 
quite as bad, but it was pretty interesting. They

15:56.588 --> 15:57.729
gave us a hard time. And generally describe the 
student body. They're all male? All male, all

16:03.437 --> 16:07.523
folks interested in going to sea. Pretty well all 
Texans? There were... I'd say 90% Texans. The

16:14.156 --> 16:19.302
Fort, let me just kind of explain the campus a 
little bit. The Fort Crockett was an old army post.

16:22.806 --> 16:27.231
The San Luis Hotel actually used to not, was not 
there and they had that gun emplacement out there.

16:28.032 --> 16:31.496
And so they had these beautiful old buildings that 
they built back in the 30s. And the school, you

16:31.516 --> 16:38.224
walked right out and it was just a, it was a big grass 
front area with a flag pole. And then you walk about

16:38.660 --> 16:42.204
another 200 yards and you were on the beach. And it 
was all, in those days in Galveston, there wasn't

16:42.605 --> 16:45.147
much down there. Coast Guard was down that way, and 
that was about it. And then stuff that was

16:47.550 --> 16:49.512
associated with oceanography. The class size 
was, I guess, all told, there were probably 100,

16:50.193 --> 17:00.465
maybe 60 to 100, you know, coming and going. We had 
some former military folks who were there on the GI

17:00.783 --> 17:08.680
Bill that went through all the stuff that resided 
at home. Some of them were married, which we found a

17:08.780 --> 17:13.189
little bit strange. The building had been fixed up 
really nice. The class size was just wonderful. I

17:18.660 --> 17:21.122
mean, it was 10, 15 people in a class. I carried 21, 
22 hours the whole time I was down there. And I never

17:26.186 --> 17:31.131
felt, you know, like I couldn't handle it. And 
then, of course, in the summer, you asked about,

17:31.151 --> 17:38.057
once we got the ship fixed, you know, it took about 
three fall starts to get her to sea that year. Now,

17:38.097 --> 17:42.501
having commanded a couple of ships and looking 
back on that experience, Boy, I'll tell you what,

17:42.481 --> 17:44.584
we were lucky. We were lucky that we didn't have a 
major, major conflagration on that ship. But we

17:49.732 --> 17:56.202
got her to sea, went to Halifax, crossed the North 
Atlantic, and got in some good storms up there. And

17:56.342 --> 18:10.885
actually, we lost our power a couple of times and 
made it over from Halifax over to, I can see we went

17:56.342 --> 18:10.885
into Dublin, Ireland, and then down to 
Bournemouth, England. into the Canary Islands

18:11.135 --> 18:15.481
and then back through Bermuda and back into 
Galveston. Now, you were hoping for a career in the

18:15.862 --> 18:19.207
Navy. I wanted a career in the Navy. What about your 
shipmates? Well, it kind of varied. Most of them

18:25.957 --> 18:27.139
wanted to go to sea. And the Merchant Marines in 
those days, we were really hurting for Merchant

18:27.419 --> 18:32.126
Marine officers. And Vietnam was going on. They 
had some 500 ships that weren't crewed enough to

18:34.029 --> 18:37.935
even get out of port. So the unions were going 
strong. Merchant Marines was going strong. The

18:43.322 --> 18:45.850
money was phenomenal. I made more, my first year 
out of school in 68, 69, I made about $50,000, which

18:46.032 --> 18:56.187
was just amazing. Yeah, I paid more in taxes my 
first year out of college than I made my first year

18:56.227 --> 19:04.901
in the Navy, which really confused my wife a little 
bit. So you finish your first year here. Go down

19:09.067 --> 19:10.288
there. Summer. Ship out pretty well all summer? 
All summer long. It was about a, I want to say 90 day.

19:17.034 --> 19:20.197
Then come back there for the fall. A few days off and 
did the fall semester. Then how often did you all

19:22.659 --> 19:25.741
come back up here then? All the ball games. We 
marched in at all the ball games. You came up on

19:28.544 --> 19:29.565
buses? No, actually we came up individually as a 
matter of fact. And by then, folks, you know, we

19:33.348 --> 19:38.112
had, that's an interesting question. I think, and 
there might have been a bus, but most of, you know,

19:38.564 --> 19:45.714
we all had classmates that had cars, so it didn't, 
transportation wasn't a problem. And

19:45.794 --> 19:47.176
hitchhiked, we hitchhiked. What uniform did you 
wear? We wore the Navy. We wore Navy blues or

19:49.539 --> 19:52.703
whites, depending on what time of year it was. 
Official Navy, not an A&M style. No, they were

19:55.927 --> 19:56.869
official Navy. In fact, I wore them until I got 
spatta. They didn't fit me. I wore them through

19:59.712 --> 20:01.114
flight training. It was the same exact uniform as 
the Navy wears. Was there an Aggie, College

20:04.098 --> 20:08.284
Station Aggie nickname for you guys? What did they 
call you? What the heck were we? Sea cadets.

20:17.707 --> 20:18.308
That's a good question. It's in the annual. I just 
can't remember what it is. I would think they must

20:20.672 --> 20:22.355
have done something. They did, yeah. But we never 
had any, we were always accepted. Where did you,

20:27.316 --> 20:31.360
when you were up here for a football game, where did 
you sleep? Motels. Oh, okay. And then we had some

20:32.802 --> 20:38.548
upperclassmen that had come back up here for 
courses or whatever. So there was ways to, that was

20:38.808 --> 20:40.950
never an issue either. Sometimes we just came up 
for the game and went home. I can remember doing

20:43.393 --> 20:44.814
that. Back down in Galveston, did you all 
transplant any A&M traditions? Oh, all of them.

20:51.970 --> 20:52.591
Everything. We wore all that. We'd come up here for 
silver taps and all that kind of stuff. But down

20:57.639 --> 21:02.366
there, we wore all the same belt buckles. Even with 
the Navy uniform, we wore a white belt. We did all

21:04.970 --> 21:11.900
the traditional, as much as we could, wearing 
those uniforms. So then after your sophomore

21:12.882 --> 21:16.527
year, what do you do in the summer? I would go and 
cruise again. Same thing, carried almost like 12

21:17.949 --> 21:21.774
hours in summer school. But your job kind of 
changes on the cruise, on the training ship.

21:27.622 --> 21:43.223
Instead of being just like an able-bodied seaman 
and chipping and painting and all that kind of

21:27.622 --> 21:43.223
stuff, the second cruise you move up into standing 
watches in the engine room and up on the bridge and

21:27.622 --> 21:43.223
you start signaling, you start navigating. and 
doing all that kind of stuff. So it was a nice flow.

21:47.276 --> 21:51.184
And did you and your buddies think that you were 
real Texas Aggies? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

21:52.587 --> 21:54.090
There was never any doubt about that. General 
Rudder came down several times. We had our picture

21:57.778 --> 21:59.541
made right out here. you know just like uh... just 
like if you open the book you can't tell the

21:59.858 --> 22:24.313
difference uh... who was the uh... the chief 
executive officer of the maritime it was it was

21:59.858 --> 22:24.313
bennett dotson captain bm dotson in those days and 
then uh... uh... a uh... coast guard two star by the

21:59.858 --> 22:24.313
name of craig came in describe dotson he was a uh... 
We called him the old rattlesnake. He looked the

22:27.256 --> 22:30.799
part of a naval officer. He was gray-headed and 
just looked the part. A nice man, a wonderfully

22:36.164 --> 22:38.466
nice man. Had this vision along with some other 
folks down there and got it aligned with Texas A&M,

22:38.526 --> 22:47.053
which was the smartest thing they ever did. And 
then went to the state. The state had already

22:49.516 --> 22:54.300
obligated some money to build a Texas maritime 
school But they just hadn't done much about it.

22:57.605 --> 23:02.532
And, of course, the Maritime Administration had 
money that they could give from a government

22:57.605 --> 23:02.532
source. And he orchestrated all that, did a great 
job. Now, he, there were things that, you know, he

23:06.217 --> 23:16.512
was in the Navy, ship handling in the Navy is, I'll 
be blunt, I think it's terrible. And having done a

23:17.273 --> 23:18.955
lot of ship handling, And I remember in, where was 
it, in Halifax, or no, in Los Palmos and Canary

23:20.200 --> 23:31.911
Islands, we started bringing the ship away from 
the dock, and the gangplank still looked up. So,

23:31.931 --> 23:33.332
you know, there were some of those. We dropped the 
anchor in Bermuda, and everybody tried to tell him

23:33.352 --> 23:41.139
that, you know, this isn't the place to anchor, and 
the anchor went all the way to its bitter end, if you

23:33.352 --> 23:41.139
will. So, you know, he had those kinds of things 
that kind of gave him the name Old Rattlesnake. But

23:46.123 --> 23:50.207
he was a heck of a nice man and really was a guy that 
kind of put the whole thing together. What was it

23:50.187 --> 23:55.294
like to be a college student in Galveston on the 
island? Well, you know, we were working so hard. I

23:57.217 --> 23:58.218
love Galveston. In fact, we have a house down there 
that we share. We spend our time halfway between

24:00.661 --> 24:03.385
Florida and Texas. We're both places. And 
Galveston was a wonderful, just a wonderful place

24:04.587 --> 24:09.013
to live. A lot of stuff going on and a lot of ships, a 
lot of activities. And, of course, you're doing

24:14.340 --> 24:16.563
what you want to do. And, you know, you've got a big 
machinery you're dealing with and everything.

24:19.567 --> 24:22.751
And it was a great place. And we weren't as remote. 
In those days, Texas A&M was pretty remote, and

24:26.636 --> 24:30.100
there weren't a whole lot of things to do. Down 
there, there was always something to do. And it was

24:32.823 --> 24:34.806
really a lot of fun. I would think that Galveston 
would be a marvelous college. Oh, it was. It was

24:38.670 --> 24:39.752
just a one. Of course, we'd do things like to get a 
date. We'd go down to the nurse's dorm at the

24:44.474 --> 24:55.977
University of Texas Medical Center down there, 
and we'd just dial a bunch of room numbers, and then

24:44.474 --> 24:55.977
we'd hide behind the couch, and when they'd come 
down, we'd kind of call out the ones we wanted. I

24:57.380 --> 24:59.664
mean, really some crazy things, but we had a good 
time. We had a good time. Where were some wild

25:00.927 --> 25:05.197
places in Galveston? Oh, that whole Strand area 
down there was wild. There were a bunch of places

25:09.046 --> 25:13.456
down there you could get in trouble. Was the 
Balinese room still going there? The Balinese

25:16.002 --> 25:17.445
room was still going on. In fact, we... Going on in 
the sense that we had a couple of our, we call

25:18.848 --> 25:29.064
ourselves the Cadet Corps down there, and we had a 
couple of Corps parties in there, Christmas

25:18.848 --> 25:29.064
parties and things. So it was going. Because once 
upon a time that was. Gambling. Yeah. It wasn't

25:34.572 --> 25:36.375
when I was down there. And, of course, the Flagship 
Hotel was a place. It was always fun to go to the

25:39.159 --> 25:42.865
Flagship Hotel and have a party because you'd get 
in the elevator and, Of course, wearing a Navy

25:43.199 --> 25:49.610
uniform, they'd look at you and think you're the 
elevator operator and say, give me the fifth

25:43.199 --> 25:49.610
floor, will you please? Those kinds of things went 
on all the time. I remember Stuart Udall landed. We

25:53.436 --> 26:01.630
graduated the class of 67 down there six months 
early because of the necessity to get officers

25:53.436 --> 26:01.630
into the Merchant Marines. Some of those guys had 
to come back up here and finish class up to get their

26:02.452 --> 26:08.582
diploma. But they graduated them early. So I was 
very fortunate to be, I was picked as the Corps

26:10.465 --> 26:15.454
Commander down there in January. So I think I had 
that job longer than anybody. So I had it all

26:17.217 --> 26:21.063
through that last part of my junior year and all of 
my senior year. So it was kind of interesting.

26:23.027 --> 26:27.875
Describe, what was it like to be the Commander? 
Well, it was interesting. One of the first things

26:29.438 --> 26:32.663
we did was get our code of conduct. more in line with 
what they have here at Texas A&M at the main campus

26:33.031 --> 26:39.585
because I thought we ought to be closer aligned. I 
had a great staff that Cecil Eubanks and others

26:40.306 --> 26:45.558
that worked on that. We also took a good hard look at 
the hazing part. I just in my heart of hearts, and I

26:50.969 --> 26:57.597
could do it because I'd been hazed pretty heavily, 
I just didn't see what that brought to the

26:50.969 --> 26:57.597
equation. I felt there were other ways to stress 
people and not beat them. You know, I just didn't

27:01.702 --> 27:05.045
think that was a thing one person ought to do to 
another. So we knocked all that stuff out. We still

27:07.068 --> 27:10.131
did pushups and setups and that kind of stuff, but 
we knocked all that. We put our emphasis on

27:10.171 --> 27:19.322
appearance and uniforms and academics and I think 
that was probably about the right thing to do. And

27:20.112 --> 27:23.156
you reported to whom? I reported to the executive 
officer, a fellow by the name of Philbrick, who's

27:24.037 --> 27:30.345
retired and lives down in Corpus Christi. And he 
was really a nice man. He'd been at the Maine

27:32.367 --> 27:35.631
Maritime Academy and came down. And, you know, he 
allowed us to carry on our Texas A&M. He didn't

27:40.897 --> 27:44.422
understand them all, but he allowed us to carry 
most of our conditions on. When did you acquire

27:45.603 --> 27:47.065
your nickname? That was done in combat in Vietnam 
after I went to flight training. I think everybody

27:51.655 --> 27:55.379
called me Pick in those days, pretty much. 
Curiosity, I have a sidelined interest in how

27:57.082 --> 28:03.730
names develop. What does Pick-A-Vance mean to 
you? We've never traced it too far because we think

28:06.854 --> 28:15.465
there might be some questionable lineage there, 
but that aside, we think it goes back to the Norman

28:06.854 --> 28:15.465
invasion. and you know back as you knowing names 
the second names are in those days were

28:15.766 --> 28:44.592
non-existent and when they started having second 
names it became a pretty much what you did we think

28:15.766 --> 28:44.592
that it comes from picks advance from the from the 
picks from the invasion and the interesting thing

28:15.766 --> 28:44.592
is there's two spellings my name is 
p-i-c-k-a-v-a-n-c-e which is the protestant

28:15.766 --> 28:44.592
spelling or so it seems to be The Catholic spelling 
is P-I-C-K-V-A-N-C-E. So my name in English is

28:49.727 --> 28:56.185
pronounced Pickovance, and the Catholic version 
is Pickvance.

28:57.785 --> 29:02.314
And did you and your buddies did feel like you were 
Aggies? Absolutely. There was never any doubt. As

29:03.977 --> 29:12.573
a matter of fact, we received our commission and 
our license in Galveston, and we came up here and

29:03.977 --> 29:12.573
graduated right out of the gym, just like 
everybody else. Every summer you went on a big

29:12.593 --> 29:14.877
cruise. Right. And it was all summer? It wasn't 
just six weeks? Oh, no, it was – well, it was – I want

29:21.157 --> 29:25.303
to say it was like 90 days, something like that, 80 
to 90 days. And you began to feel sure of your career

29:25.323 --> 29:30.330
goal? No doubt, no doubt. It stayed. When I got my 
commission, I had to ship out because we just

29:33.395 --> 29:41.467
didn't have enough. So when I got my license and my 
commission, now the license exam is, you know,

29:41.527 --> 29:48.116
that takes a week and about eight hours a day. It's a 
really tough exam. And again because of the

29:50.485 --> 29:58.924
standards that existed with this university that 
carried over to Galveston because we were held

29:50.485 --> 29:58.924
accountable down there for our grades. I mean all 
of our you know, all my, everything was like, it was

29:59.918 --> 30:05.406
just as if I was going to school up here, but in a 
different major. There was distance involved,

30:06.347 --> 30:07.889
but that's it. And I sort of think that's what we've 
done with some of these other schools that are part

30:08.210 --> 30:13.217
of the Texas A&M University system. I don't, and of 
course, Galveston. I think it's all, I don't note

30:15.880 --> 30:18.864
any difference. And so, no, we felt like we were 
part of it, and it was... You know, we were proud to

30:22.666 --> 30:24.429
wear our rings. Just like, in fact, last night 
there were two youngsters sitting there that I

30:24.489 --> 30:31.963
didn't recognize, my friends, because nobody 
else had done it up until Randy House got up there.

30:32.123 --> 30:37.092
And I feel very bad that I didn't now because those 
two twins sitting there just put their rings on

30:32.123 --> 30:37.092
yesterday. And I probably should have mentioned 
that, but it didn't seem appropriate for what we

30:37.152 --> 30:42.582
were doing, so I didn't. Those two boys had been in 
the Navy and were now down there going to school

30:43.068 --> 30:47.459
with their dad. In fact, Carl, the fellow with the 
beard, is a retired captain of the Merchant

30:47.499 --> 30:52.291
Marines and he's teaching down there now. Your 
ring, do you remember how much it cost? $60.

30:57.865 --> 30:58.827
Where'd you get that? My mother paid for it. How did 
you feel when you put it on? Oh, it was a, it was, I

31:02.264 --> 31:16.906
can't, I haven't seen, I had a, by then my grades had 
gotten, I was up, I was an distinguished student

31:02.264 --> 31:16.906
and all that kind of stuff, and I was up, I think, in 
the 10%, top 10% or 1% or whatever they, whatever it

31:02.264 --> 31:16.906
is, whatever, wherever you have to be to be noted in 
the Dallas Morning News, because my mother saw my

31:02.264 --> 31:16.906
name there. But I can remember driving that, 
driving that Mustang with my hand on the mirror so

31:17.507 --> 31:24.077
everybody could see my ring. Do you have any good 
ring stories since then? Well, oh, gosh. You know,

31:31.731 --> 31:38.301
Aggies,

31:31.731 --> 31:38.301
I look at everybody's ring to see where they're 
from. Now, occasionally I'll get a Citadel or a VMI

31:38.341 --> 31:50.959
ring, but there's such a connection there, as you 
well know from our beginnings, and, of course,

31:38.341 --> 31:50.959
they don't have a stone in their ring either.
