WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:02.088
All right. Well, now, what further questions? 
Well, I think, actually, all that we have you to,

00:04.591 --> 00:21.110
really, is 1953, when you're going to leave the 
Bureau, when you, well, really until 51, when you

00:04.591 --> 00:21.110
begin, evidently, to think about leaving the 
Bureau of Mines in 51 or 52. And you leave in 53. Is

00:23.373 --> 00:27.017
there any particular reason why you decided to 
leave the government and join academe?

00:29.883 --> 00:32.447
Yes, I think there were specific reasons. One, I 
felt that

00:32.467 --> 00:49.410
it was going to be many years before we were going to 
go into a synthetic fuel program because of the

00:32.467 --> 00:49.410
vast reserves of the Middle East. And I felt under 
those circumstances that...

00:57.288 --> 01:01.833
less interested in synthetic fields. And so to 
that extent, I had thought that this thing was so

01:01.853 --> 01:15.807
far off in the future that I'd do better to devote a 
considerable amount of my energy to other

01:01.853 --> 01:15.807
studies. And so I came out here to the University of 
Maryland. I did continue a modest amount of work

01:19.631 --> 01:26.198
with the Spencer Chemical Company and the El Paso 
Natural Gas Company. But I also did a good deal of

01:27.140 --> 01:36.455
consulting work in connection with building 
ammonia plants and urea plants and things of that

01:27.140 --> 01:36.455
nature. And I didn't really resume my interest in 
synthetic fuels until the late 1960s. And I think

01:44.217 --> 01:48.002
officially that's the way it might be expressed. I 
have another question for you. It's sort of a

01:49.183 --> 01:50.345
loaded question. Do you suppose if you had a chance 
to go back through the government documents

01:50.945 --> 02:01.078
again, through the German documents and the 
government documents again, would they call

01:50.945 --> 02:01.078
things back to your attention you think that you 
had missed before? Well, during the past few

02:02.159 --> 02:08.787
years, since my interest in synthetic fuels has 
revived, I have done a lot of that. I have reviewed a

02:08.968 --> 02:10.950
lot of that. And in connection with this work for 
the National Academy of Engineering, we have, in

02:11.605 --> 02:24.959
fact, reviewed every process that is publicly 
described for either the fissure structure or the

02:11.605 --> 02:24.959
cool hydrogenation process. That includes 
things like the Winklers and the Schmalfeld and

02:24.979 --> 02:28.663
the... Yes, yes it does. I see. And those reports 
from the National Academy of Engineers, as I say,

02:32.267 --> 02:41.157
there have been five committees working on them, 
and there's about six or eight men on each

02:32.267 --> 02:41.157
committee. And those reports ought to be out this 
year. I'll

02:44.288 --> 02:54.598
look for those. OK. Oh, stop the record a minute.

03:03.688 --> 03:10.755
Now, that's the reason why I'm interested in how, 
when you go back through these documents in

03:03.688 --> 03:10.755
archives,

03:12.592 --> 03:14.835
And we look at them. Let me begin a question with a 
question, which is a dumb way to do things. But if

03:18.339 --> 03:25.589
one is an historian and he goes over the same 
sources from five different angles, usually

03:18.339 --> 03:25.589
other things occur to him as he goes through. That 
is, he looks for different things. For example,

03:26.890 --> 03:32.938
when he's reading a letter and writing a book, 
things that you missed the first time occur to you

03:26.890 --> 03:32.938
the second time. Is the same thing true in your 
work? Yes, it is. Every time I go over this, I see

03:36.042 --> 03:39.627
certain things from a different angle. And... see 
things that I didn't see before, and I'm sure that

03:42.308 --> 03:53.442
if I went over

03:42.308 --> 03:53.442
data again, I would still see other angles. But as a 
matter of fact, my interest in this is continuing,

03:53.462 --> 04:02.853
and I am doing that to the extent that I can, even at 
the present time. Okay. Now, so when you look at a

04:03.935 --> 04:09.902
document, you say, well, since I'm using Germans 
and synthetic fuels as an example, I'm going to

04:03.935 --> 04:09.902
stay with them. You're saying, now, if they had 
dropped this and done this, for example, then this

04:10.220 --> 04:16.910
might possibly work? That's the way you arrive at 
things? Yeah. All right. And do you also say, then,

04:20.095 --> 04:28.707
if they had done this and this, if we add this in 
terms of modern technology, would that be the

04:20.095 --> 04:28.707
solution? Yes, and...

04:30.550 --> 04:35.818
Now, what I want to know is... I think that ERDA 
has... is paying people like the Floor

04:40.038 --> 04:48.065
Corporation and other people to try and do that 
right now. And they are making extensive cost

04:49.166 --> 05:00.336
studies of various combinations of processes and 
everything like this to try to arrive at more

04:49.166 --> 05:00.336
economical solutions. Now, if I understand it 
presently, that there are at least two approaches

05:00.436 --> 05:10.045
to the use of synthetic oils, one trying to build 
should I say, or add to the information from World

05:10.497 --> 05:23.037
War I in terms of continuous use of technology and 
the other trying to turn the direction of the

05:10.497 --> 05:23.037
technology. Okay, that's... And I also should 
mention to you that the University of Utah is doing

05:23.157 --> 05:34.716
some very interesting work that...

05:36.063 --> 05:42.293
By the way, I think it's referred to in that paper, 
so you can get a copy of their work. The man out there

05:42.894 --> 05:47.221
to talk to if you want to talk to him about the 
University of New York is Wendell Weiser. He's the

05:47.702 --> 05:49.424
man who runs the work out there. Was he involved in? 
He's been involved in this committee work at the

05:51.728 --> 05:55.594
National Academy of Engineers. He would be a very 
good man to talk to. Okay. When did this National

05:58.859 --> 06:01.363
Academy of Engineers work begin? When did their 
work begin in synthetic fuels? Well, now I've got

06:03.282 --> 06:06.368
to answer that in two ways. We started 
gasification work at the National Academy of

06:06.468 --> 06:13.781
Engineering and studied high BTU gasification 
about six or eight years ago. And this last program

06:13.801 --> 06:25.662
started about two years ago, dealing 
particularly with synthetic fuels, which is your

06:13.801 --> 06:25.662
prime interest in this interview, I think. Has 
there been much connection between the National

06:26.063 --> 06:34.611
Academy and, for instance, the high gas process 
development at the Illinois Institute of

06:26.063 --> 06:34.611
Technology? Yes, we've had very close contact 
with those people. As a matter of fact, Henry

06:38.635 --> 06:46.522
Liven, who's the president of high gas, is on one of 
the committees of the National Academy of

06:38.635 --> 06:46.522
Engineering. And Frank Skora, who is the vice 
president of IGT, is a very good personal friend of

06:47.183 --> 06:54.450
mine, and I've talked to him quite often. And we 
have one man by the name of Bill Bodle who is on the

06:54.430 --> 07:01.889
liquefaction committee that we're talking 
about. So they're well involved in this. And the

07:03.452 --> 07:05.638
oil companies have people on these committees. 
The universities have people on these

07:05.798 --> 07:10.971
committees, and so on and so forth. You better get a 
good story about these committees from Bob

07:11.677 --> 07:14.962
Crozier. Yes. Because I think you ought to give a 
little story. No question about it. No question

07:22.191 --> 07:23.513
about it. Because it seems like the decisions... A 
few pages, anyway. Oh, to be sure. Because it seems

07:27.178 --> 07:31.484
like the culmination of this is in the National 
Academy. And you know there's been all kinds of

07:31.584 --> 07:40.857
cost studies made on this by ECAS and by Florida 
Corporation and by... Parsons and by practically

07:41.984 --> 07:51.761
every big construction company in the country 
paid for by IRDA, or partly paid for by IRDA. And the

07:52.282 --> 07:56.790
oil companies themselves have made cost studies 
and so on and so forth. So it's a very, very broad

07:56.810 --> 08:04.363
attack on the problem.

08:06.149 --> 08:10.134
I take it that you came straight into the chemistry 
department here at Maryland in 53, 54. Chemical

08:10.474 --> 08:11.255
engineering. Chemical engineering department, 
excuse me. Chemical engineering department.

08:14.199 --> 08:15.040
Yes, yes. And then remained here from 53? Yes. The 
work I did from 53 to 60 on coal hydrogenation was on

08:17.743 --> 08:24.832
a consulting basis. Okay. It had nothing to do with 
the University of Maryland. And did your... What

08:29.858 --> 08:52.356
were your interests other than synthetic fuels 
between 53 and, I know it's hard to ask me what his

08:29.858 --> 08:52.356
interests were over the last 20 years, but I mean in 
terms of professional... Well, largely I got

08:29.858 --> 08:52.356
involved in, aside from the small amount of work I 
did in synthetic, in coal hydrogenation at that

08:29.858 --> 08:52.356
time, my work was largely in connection with 
ammonia and urea plants, and I served as a

08:53.281 --> 09:03.119
consulting chemical engineer for the Indonesian 
government for seven years out of that time. We

09:04.201 --> 09:11.395
built two plants for producing ammonia and urea, 
one in Sumatra and one in Java, and that took most of

09:04.201 --> 09:11.395
my time. I did quite a lot of work for the Atomic 
Energy Commission. I work for Reynolds Metals

09:16.737 --> 09:19.926
Company and various corporations. I think it's 
all in my, not in detail, but my... No, I can't,

09:20.066 --> 09:26.202
partially it's here in your vitae. All right. 
Orrin, do you have any questions? Yes, I'd like to

09:32.701 --> 09:45.398
inquire, do you ever, going back to the TOM, the 
technical oil mission that we started, that we

09:32.701 --> 09:45.398
talked about earlier, do you ever see any of these 
technical oil mission people? Are they in

09:45.498 --> 09:52.347
business or are they in industry or have they, like 
you, put their... earlier experience to work, or

09:52.968 --> 09:56.954
did they go on into something else? Do you see these 
people? Do you know? I saw them for a period of

09:59.678 --> 10:12.036
perhaps eight to ten years after we concluded that 
work, up until about 1960 or so. But since then,

10:13.799 --> 10:21.490
I've seen very little of them. But most of those 
people are probably, many of them I know are

10:22.550 --> 10:27.755
retired. I still have Christmas cards from them 
and things like that, but they're retired and

10:27.895 --> 10:34.582
they're out of the work. One or two of them are still 
active. One or two of the Bureau of Mines people,

10:37.525 --> 10:48.696
Zeke Clark and Martin Elliott and a few people like 
that are still active, but there are a few of them.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.498
And you know Henry Linden, I mentioned the IGT 
person. He once made the statement that at the time

10:56.196 --> 11:17.062
this oil problem broke on us in the late 60s, or 
however you want to put it, that there probably

10:56.196 --> 11:17.062
weren't more than 100 to 200 people who really knew 
anything about synthetic fuels who were still

10:56.196 --> 11:17.062
active. And I guess that's probably a fair 
statement, really. And that left a tremendous gap

11:22.287 --> 11:31.382
in our technological ability and made it very 
difficult for her to get started. What we're

11:32.745 --> 11:37.432
trying to do is to rebuild this technology.

11:38.514 --> 11:46.468
What astonished me about it all was that a whole 
technology such as the Germans had built up could

11:38.514 --> 11:46.468
be completely lost. It was completely lost in 
Germany, too. I've talked to the Germans, and some

11:49.152 --> 11:58.078
of them hardly knew that there was a German 
synthetic fuel technology, the younger German

11:49.152 --> 11:58.078
people. That's a very good point. What would you 
say accounted for the lack of transition between

11:59.021 --> 12:03.735
wartime and peacetime Well, I think, again, it was 
this tremendous flood of oil that took all the

12:04.222 --> 12:12.454
synthetic fuel technology out of the picture. It 
wouldn't be political. I don't think it was

12:13.696 --> 12:15.619
political. I don't think it was political. And I 
don't think it had anything to do with the fact that

12:17.802 --> 12:25.854
the oil companies necessarily wanted to lose the 
technology. I think it was a fact that the

12:25.934 --> 12:33.064
economics were against the technology and there 
was little reason to support it. You know about the

12:33.922 --> 12:37.827
fisher tropics plants in South Africa, don't you? 
Yes, the Sasso. You know there is the Sasso plant.

12:41.032 --> 12:43.836
It's about a 5,000 barrel a day plant, which was 
built in 1953. And that was the last big synthetic

12:45.178 --> 12:49.263
fuel plant that was ever built. And now, of course, 
you know that they are building another plant,

12:50.345 --> 12:57.114
much like the Sasso plant. It's not exactly the 
same design, but it's similar. And it's supposed

13:00.359 --> 13:03.203
to produce 40,000 barrels. I think it's about 100 
miles from Cecil. It's a new location. But the

13:11.020 --> 13:27.351
South Africans, I think, have taken the position 
that they want an independent oil production

13:11.020 --> 13:27.351
regardless of economic costs. That's not a bad 
position to take because I think we... We may have

13:27.972 --> 13:33.637
to take the same position. Yes, who knows? And 
maybe we will. And when they do, if such a decision

13:37.942 --> 13:46.870
is made, for instance, by the National Academy or 
by anybody... Or by her or the government. I don't

13:46.930 --> 13:49.393
want the government to do less. The more we fool 
with that, the better off we are, in my opinion.

13:54.738 --> 13:54.958
Yes, right. As a matter of fact, the Texas A&M 
University and the Center for Energy and Mental

13:55.242 --> 14:09.921
Resources prides itself on the fact that we have 
turned to private industry for our support,

13:55.242 --> 14:09.921
and we did not... Yes, you've got all private 
industry. Yes. There were no funds there either.

14:19.677 --> 14:21.499
Rockefeller Foundation. Oh, no. This is all done 
by... It's not funded in any way by... Erd is

14:26.166 --> 14:34.257
interested, and Erd is... I'm glad to know that. 
Oh, we have... This is not for... It doesn't

14:40.465 --> 14:41.767
matter. ...people that are still around or...

14:50.525 --> 14:59.733
you feel might have had some experiences that 
might... Miller's dead, isn't he? You don't know,

14:59.773 --> 15:00.514
huh? Yeah, he is dead. He's an older man than that. 
He is dead. That's Albert Miller. Albert E.

15:06.259 --> 15:08.141
Miller, yeah, he's gone. Farragut is gone. There 
was a fellow by the name of Jones at Coppers who was

15:09.782 --> 15:16.048
very active. Kenneth Gordon is gone. Allred is 
dead, I believe. Harold

15:21.237 --> 15:29.709
Atwell was with me a lot. I believe Harold Atwell, 
he's retired from the Texas company. I know

15:33.054 --> 15:34.957
whether he's dead or not, I don't know. Those

15:35.017 --> 15:43.870
are the ones that occurred to my mind.

15:46.668 --> 15:48.430
Well, we know Petty John is still alive. Petty 
John's still living. He's in Sarasota. He wasn't

15:50.794 --> 15:53.437
with our group, but he was certainly a very active 
one. He led the oil mission, the Navy oil mission

15:53.477 --> 15:57.563
over there, right? And I'm sure he can tell a few 
people from his own mission that may be around and

15:58.584 --> 16:05.233
so on and so on. There's one or two people in the oil 
companies that I know are still active, but their

16:05.956 --> 16:14.870
names get away from me. There was a Reiser or a 
Rensler or a Rissler or somebody up in

16:14.970 --> 16:20.559
Connecticut. I remember reading about Richler, 
Reisler, Rensler. What's that name? I can't think

16:28.571 --> 16:29.112
of his name. I think the best thing for you to do, 
though, is to get those names off those reels,

16:30.425 --> 16:44.359
because those papers were all authored by people 
who were involved in the missions.

16:44.379 --> 16:44.599
Right. I just thought if you were still on good 
terms with them locally, we could pick up the phone

16:45.741 --> 16:52.347
and say howdy. A lot of these people I saw very 
little after the mission was over. And our few

16:59.720 --> 17:06.326
meetings here in Washington, and it's only when 
you give me the names that I recall them. Whereas

17:06.786 --> 17:11.290
the people I worked with in the Bureau of Mines, I 
mean, I had much closer association with them. And

17:12.451 --> 17:14.313
they and their names stick in my mind. But most of 
those people, too, are either retired or dead.

17:18.316 --> 17:25.682
Would

17:18.316 --> 17:25.682
you want to hazard a guess on what you think the 
future of synthetic oil is to the country? That is,

17:26.443 --> 17:28.765
do you think it's going to come or not come? Well,

17:29.133 --> 17:57.655
I think that

17:29.133 --> 17:57.655
the United States particularly has

17:29.133 --> 17:57.655
got to find some way to convert our large reserves 
of coal to liquid and gaseous fuels.

18:00.588 --> 18:07.994
And

18:00.588 --> 18:07.994
I think that synthetic fuels has to come. But 
whether it's before the year 2000 or not, I don't

18:09.155 --> 18:12.278
know. And that will depend, I think, not only on our 
own technical ability, which is part of the story.

18:20.805 --> 18:25.068
I think there are technical possibilities that 
have still not yet been properly explored. But

18:25.909 --> 18:30.493
it's also going to depend on what attitude the 
Arabs take future cost of oil. My own feeling is

18:34.733 --> 18:41.925
also that we're going to have to develop our 
nuclear energy plants. I see no other solution to

18:42.526 --> 18:45.811
this than to develop nuclear energy. We've got to 
learn to live with this nuclear energy. We have to

18:48.796 --> 18:53.424
learn to take care of those plant residues and so on 
and so forth. And we've got to get this big load from

18:53.444 --> 18:57.831
the electric power plants off of coal and off of oil 
and gas as fast as we can, I believe. That's my

19:01.687 --> 19:04.311
opinion of the situation. Now, if you ask me about 
solar energy and wind energy and things like this,

19:04.331 --> 19:14.624
I think these are all future, maybe after the year 
2000, but I can't see that far ahead, really.

19:17.247 --> 19:18.108
That's all I need to know. Do you need to know 
anything for your program? No, I can't think of

19:19.710 --> 19:20.371
anything. Anything you'd like to add? No, I think 
that covers practically everything. Do we sit

19:25.077 --> 19:27.600
here and exhaust you for three hours? Yes.
