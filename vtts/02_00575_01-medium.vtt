WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:12.996
Because

00:02.680 --> 00:12.996
I was in French school, you know, since I was in, 
what do you call it, post-college. Post-college.

00:14.678 --> 00:29.481
And then when I finished high school, about the 
time, you know, the war,

00:14.678 --> 00:29.481
you know, come in Vietnam by... We knew

00:30.389 --> 00:55.587
the war, World War II, you know, was exciting in 
Europe, but we didn't know The war would be spread

00:56.647 --> 01:07.898
in South Asia, in Paris, until the day when the 
Japanese, you know, when they came. Then we know,

01:07.918 --> 01:17.728
you know, we feel or I feel, for my part, that the 
World War II, you know, would touch Paris,

01:07.918 --> 01:17.728
particularly Vietnam. Yeah. This was your high 
school? Yeah. That's why I just finished high

01:20.791 --> 01:23.734
school.

01:26.718 --> 01:36.772
And the reason was I don't want to learn Japanese

01:26.718 --> 01:36.772
language. Because I said I've been learning 
French, and now there's no reason I can throw all

01:36.832 --> 01:45.805
this away and then learn Japanese. That's the one 
reason why I don't want to... So it's, you know, my

01:54.123 --> 02:00.157
story, you know, is Japanese

01:54.123 --> 02:00.157
language. And that's why, you know, I found a job in 
the work,

02:01.119 --> 02:12.486
you know, in the, in some of the I recall, you know, 
the corporation was with H-14s that told us, you

02:13.647 --> 02:23.540
know, from Vietnam out. That's during the 
Japanese and Occupational War, of course.

02:31.671 --> 02:42.726
And then, you know, I think when, in 1951, that's 
the day when the South government The Soviet

02:43.432 --> 02:49.379
government tried to set up a armed force. We had, 
you know, a government, and they wanted to put, you

02:49.819 --> 03:10.502
know, an armed force, and that's why I was enrolled 
in the Air Force, which I remained there all the,

02:49.819 --> 03:10.502
during all the war until 1974. I've been in the Air

03:12.001 --> 03:21.196
Force when I fly. I flew in the transport group, and 
I was a deputy member of the transport group

03:21.216 --> 03:33.436
also. I was working under General Keating. And up 
to 1964, And I was covered teeny-wide

03:40.587 --> 03:58.473
in the Department of Civil

03:40.587 --> 03:58.473
Ignition.

03:58.493 --> 04:05.423
That was in 1974, when the Communist

03:58.493 --> 04:05.423
Party took over. I came to the country of the United 
States.

04:10.895 --> 04:20.164
I was

04:10.895 --> 04:20.164
married and I had five kids. I think that's it. I 
said, can you come with your lot of folks? Before?

04:26.350 --> 04:26.711
Yeah, before. Okay, well, I would say during my 
training, you know, when I was in the Air Force, I

04:26.811 --> 04:36.160
came in 1957. in the squadron

04:37.152 --> 04:46.823
officer school down in Montgomery, Alabama. I was 
training there for squadron

04:46.843 --> 04:56.674
officer

04:46.843 --> 04:56.674
school. In 1960, I came also to the United States, 
but at that time, I was still working in civil

04:56.694 --> 05:06.585
aviation. And then I came over here, and I came with 
the FAA over

05:07.460 --> 05:16.833
here. And then I come back and worked at the, let's 
call it, you know, like the T-Works, you know, and

05:16.853 --> 05:31.312
half in the Air Force and half

05:16.853 --> 05:31.312
in Civil Aviation. And then in 1968, I was... I 
signed, you know, to, uh, to be trained on, uh, 7.7,

05:37.008 --> 05:46.809
4.8.7, before he come. Was the boy at that level? 
Yeah. Who was this? At, uh, at Seattle? This boy?

05:52.622 --> 05:52.722
Yeah. And after I, after my training, I go back, you 
know, I fly on the, on the airline, the permission

05:54.102 --> 06:11.501
of the airline. The Los Orleis? We call it Air 
Vietnam. All right. This is the,

06:12.862 --> 06:17.948
do you want to know more about it? It's this, yeah. 
Here we go.

06:23.431 --> 06:27.395
Well, you might rephrase this, you know. Oh, yeah. 
You mean it's real to you? Mm-hmm. What do you see as

06:33.301 --> 06:40.108
the root cause of the war, the full question, and 
the origin of the war? The origin of the war? Well,

06:40.869 --> 06:48.257
the way I can see this is, of course, the origin of 
the war, you know, it's just the root causes of

06:48.963 --> 07:02.265
this, you know, it's an uprising against the 
colonial

06:48.963 --> 07:02.265
power. But, think, you know, there are any 
well-organized, you know, any unified front, you

07:03.543 --> 07:16.926
know, so-called, you know, just to fight, you 
know, with the science. And we had, you know, with

07:16.946 --> 07:25.500
just a very few people, like I told you earlier, 
maybe two or three people would be plan, you know,

07:26.341 --> 07:34.454
and get the support, you know, for an economy of the 
kind. But, actually, the root of the word is just

07:34.474 --> 07:48.015
the word, you know, Odin, the colony

07:34.474 --> 07:48.015
power. Okay.

07:51.164 --> 08:17.897
well over the vietnamese people just like your 
personal attitude towards because okay when the

07:51.164 --> 08:17.897
abelians was under france almost a century about 
80 up to 86 years and almost central all right the

07:51.164 --> 08:17.897
first thing when the people see the japanese come 
to occupy the country, and the Japanese also, you

08:18.451 --> 08:27.604
know, give some kind of promise, saying, we will 
take care of people, you know, and that. So, well,

08:28.165 --> 08:39.582
see, when you, when you're under a rule of one 
government, you know, for too long, and

08:28.165 --> 08:39.582
sometimes, you know, you want some change, See? 
And when people see the Japanese coming, the

08:41.950 --> 08:51.934
people, the folks think people welcome, say, 
well, maybe the Japanese can change, you know, the

08:41.950 --> 08:51.934
situation for the better. But, and later on they 
find, you know, the Japanese just, you know, like

08:52.403 --> 09:01.097
the French, you know, just use this country, you 
know, to... Just use it? Yes, use it. Why? See, so

09:02.259 --> 09:07.488
the Japanese, you know, now the French, you know, 
were substitute, that's all. They were

09:07.628 --> 09:08.890
substitute? Yeah. Okay, so I didn't realize that. 
But, okay, what else did the French do? All right,

09:19.319 --> 09:26.772
the French, you know, had this company about 100 
years, almost centuries. The education, you

09:26.792 --> 09:37.431
know, like up to university.

09:37.451 --> 09:42.880
Right in the South, you know, we doesn't have any 
university. There's only, in the North Vietnam,

09:43.282 --> 09:54.337
French, you know, have the school up there, the 
so-called, you know, university. But this one of

09:54.357 --> 10:05.172
the French, of the university, didn't have a full, 
you know, a formation of, like, the technology

09:54.357 --> 10:05.172
and everything. They just, okay, the school more 
or less, you know, two-form people. so they can,

10:13.353 --> 10:17.320
you know, work for the French government. You see, 
like , and things like this, but not really for

10:17.721 --> 10:23.371
technology, you know. They're just trying to 
people for their own use. Yeah, see, okay now.

10:27.619 --> 10:35.553
Otherwise, people want to get more education, you 
know, that's only privileged people who can

10:27.619 --> 10:35.553
afford enough money to go to France. Right. And 
then they can get, you know, in the university in

10:36.455 --> 10:50.363
terms of technology and how, but the people in the 
country, you know, like middle class people, you

10:36.455 --> 10:50.363
know, it's very hard. Because at this school, you 
know, the higher education has become a

10:51.203 --> 11:00.861
privilege, you know, it's not, you know, 
appropriate. So most people, you know, maybe they

11:00.881 --> 11:09.938
finish high school or maybe finish, what do you 
call, you know, maybe just... Junior high. Junior

11:11.986 --> 11:19.995
high and then quick, because they, they cannot 
afford, you know, to go to college too. Because

11:20.015 --> 11:27.303
people who worked there didn't have much money, 
you know, like the French were. The French did, you

11:27.323 --> 11:27.823
know. Because the French said, okay, now, they had 
different, you know, trade. And the people,

11:33.510 --> 11:38.575
you know, and some of the people did. What other 
type of profession do you have in culture?

11:47.911 --> 11:53.659
Or in education? Or language? Okay, and then, even 
as you think, you know, that doesn't have any big

11:54.060 --> 11:59.989
business, you know. Vietnamese didn't belong, 
you know, they didn't have, they didn't own,

12:01.825 --> 12:28.103
except for very little people, you know, like 
those people who be like, you know, French users,

12:01.825 --> 12:28.103
you know,

12:01.825 --> 12:28.103
that some people was, was training French and was 
employed by French, you know, as they The

12:28.657 --> 12:32.943
government saw

12:28.657 --> 12:32.943
them. And those people, you know, can have, you 
know, maybe more failure and more privilege. But

12:44.460 --> 12:56.537
as far as, you know, for the economy for the 
country, it's just people just work on the rice

12:44.460 --> 12:56.537
field, in the plantation, for crime. the earth you 
know just enough you know for that that's all yeah

12:57.395 --> 13:21.006
that french you know doesn't have those organized 
you know like hospital you know and pre-care or

12:57.395 --> 13:21.006
something like that yeah they do they do work in 
that

12:57.395 --> 13:21.006
and Oh, wow. Okay,

13:23.907 --> 13:31.705
so where did you- French, you know, didn't 
recognize religion, you know, like Buddhism,

13:33.068 --> 13:40.840
French didn't recognize Buddhism. They called 
it, you know, just an association, but it's not a

13:41.781 --> 13:51.255
religion, it's an official religion. Well, the 
majority of people are also with Buddhism, and

13:51.355 --> 13:55.802
then when French come, Of course, you know, 
Francis, you know, the Catholics, you know, and a

13:55.782 --> 14:14.859
lot of people, also Catholics, also, you know, 
those people, but more or less, you know, a pro very

13:55.782 --> 14:14.859
close to Christ. And, well, you can see, majority, 
maybe, I can say, you know, maybe 70%. The people of

14:24.233 --> 14:48.587
Vietnam are Buddhists, they are more or less 
Buddhists, but

14:24.233 --> 14:48.587
really not really Buddhists, because they are 
just a branch of Buddhism, more or less, you know,

14:24.233 --> 14:48.587
they venerate parents, you know, You can have 
maybe 60% of Buddhism, but anyhow Buddhism is not

14:49.310 --> 15:02.155
recognized as a true religion.

15:09.442 --> 15:15.173
Yeah, and you remember how you said that the 
Japanese, they were really just a substitute for

15:09.442 --> 15:15.173
the French, right? Yeah. How about in the U.S.? 
Were they seen as the same? No.

15:25.834 --> 15:29.661
Just stop this one, you know, when you talk about 
the U.S. and everything. The nature of the war?

15:34.338 --> 15:39.044
Okay, the nature of the war, you have, you know, 
different, different, uh, phase there. The first

15:39.064 --> 15:46.854
went, you know, the, the Vietnam uprising against 
France. That, that's we, I can tell, you know, just

15:46.874 --> 15:57.287
a, uh, against the, the colonial power. Yeah. But, 
and then, We had, we was, or the, the Vietnam of

16:00.944 --> 16:12.289
Park, you know, was infiltrated, you know, by the 
communist section, or segment of the communists.

16:12.990 --> 16:20.286
And it becomes, you know, this war, you know, 
becomes, uh, Park, you know, under the

16:12.990 --> 16:20.286
communists. The chance, you know, the chance to do 
the way the war would be done, because, now,

16:21.228 --> 16:43.250
when the country fights war, you'll be able to get 
support, see, so you can fight. But now, if those,

16:43.270 --> 16:50.577
the communists, they get support from the 
communist power, See, then they fight, you know,

16:51.451 --> 17:01.046
under the communist, you know, slogan, but it's 
not, you know, nationalistic. But they can use,

17:01.367 --> 17:04.852
they can use, you know, to come up like that. They 
say, well, we fight to liberate the country. Yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.745
There is the end just because of me? Yeah, just 
because of me. But they get the support from the

17:15.529 --> 17:17.492
communists. Now,

17:19.683 --> 17:44.104
in order to understand, you know, we have to look at 
the communists, you know, what the communists

17:19.683 --> 17:44.104
have tried to dominate the world, because 
communists is not filed directly with the free

17:44.455 --> 17:46.098
world. But you can call this kind of a proxy war. 
They use the small countries to fight against the

17:49.986 --> 17:56.178
free world.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.812
Now this is the global strategy for the economy. 
See, everywhere you have the free And communists,

18:06.950 --> 18:10.944
you know, try to steer, you know, the solution. 
Right. Because they can say, okay, well, you know,

18:11.164 --> 18:18.630
but most of the country, people in France and in the 
courts, that have the crossing funds are not very

18:19.184 --> 18:36.905
high, they're not very educated people, you see 
you have majority of people just illiterate, then

18:19.184 --> 18:36.905
it's easy then to, the countries become easy to get 
together to those people. Right, start a

18:36.925 --> 18:39.949
revolution. How about the same question, there's 
more when you're after the American revival, what

18:39.969 --> 18:47.858
did the Vietnamese people think they were signing 
for? Okay, you see, like I said, you know, when

18:49.930 --> 18:56.196
Americans...

18:58.018 --> 19:16.596
Okay, now, back to 1968, or before 68, 67,

18:58.018 --> 19:16.596
the communists just say, well, think, you know, 
Americans occupied Saudi Arabia, I mean, we tried

19:16.947 --> 19:20.033
to free the Vietnams. That they start to think, you 
know, put down or infiltrate more, you know, guns.

19:29.791 --> 19:36.424
Okay, right in the South, you know, they 
recognized, you know, one of the crime they

19:29.791 --> 19:36.424
called, you know, But they said, well, they tried 
to help those

19:36.893 --> 19:56.460
people to liquidate,

19:36.893 --> 19:56.460
and then so they became more against, you know, 
more cash. Okay, and what happened? In South

20:00.506 --> 20:02.288
Vietnam, they don't have bowels. From start, you 
know, we got the bowels. But

20:06.678 --> 20:27.319
by the nature of the war, you see, you fight a war, 
it's not, you know, open world then you can send you

20:27.569 --> 20:43.030
know all your division or battalion you know and 
then after that you know you pull back and you

20:27.569 --> 20:43.030
reorganize it but this is the get it a workplace You 
have to strip things out because you have to

20:43.263 --> 20:52.677
protect the main highway, you have to protect the 
bridge, you have to protect everything. The

20:52.697 --> 21:01.590
villages, you know, you have to protect the 
people, you have to protect the power plant in the

20:52.697 --> 21:01.590
city. So you have to have a lot of troops to protect 
all those because the communists tried to

21:02.831 --> 21:12.325
sabotage all of them. Now by nine, they just come 
out, a train is approaching the highway. They put a

21:22.139 --> 21:27.025
bomb in there, or they mine it. And in the morning 
they kill people. They kill people.

21:34.934 --> 21:40.540
Well, they kill, you know, because they say, well, 
they make, you know, so people in the Fear cannot

21:41.009 --> 21:44.777
use that thing. So you have to protect, you know, 
those high walls. And if you don't protect, you

21:49.106 --> 21:54.817
know, every night you had one picture blown. See, 
they sent, you know, their suicide note, or squad,

21:54.837 --> 22:01.431
whatever, you know, demolition team, you know. 
And that's why, you know,

22:02.288 --> 22:14.629
the government didn't have enough manpower. And 
that's why, you know, when the President Johnson

22:16.572 --> 22:26.929
was put in Vietnam, well, actually, Before that, 
you know, there was some kind of incident also

22:28.040 --> 22:34.491
involved, you know, directly to the American 
Navy. Then you heard about Maddox, you know, the

22:35.934 --> 22:45.951
ship, you know, was torpedoed or was attacked by 
North Koreans or people, you know. But at that

22:45.971 --> 22:48.175
time, because... U.S. Navy, you know, tried to try 
to prevent, you know, infiltration, you know, by

22:48.155 --> 22:55.104
sea. She tried to intercept, you know, with the 
U.S. Navy, you know, tried to intercept and patrol

22:55.925 --> 23:03.575
around. And that was, you know, was, well,

23:04.376 --> 23:12.606
that was what incidents, you know, directly 
involved. And then, you know, President Johnson

23:13.027 --> 23:17.352
said, well, the communists, you know, attack, you 
know, American troops that, you know, that go out,

23:17.635 --> 23:31.132
you know, directly

23:17.635 --> 23:31.132
with the Americans. But other Americans, you 
know, can be more different. Now, when you get, you

23:34.235 --> 23:40.403
know, okay, when you get, you know, a a large number 
of Turks in there. But of course, the mission of the

23:46.289 --> 23:54.600
Americans were there to protect. And so the 
Vietnamese army can organize, you know, the

23:54.620 --> 24:05.754
campaign around the countryside, you know, to get 
much good. And as I said, you know, protect, you

24:07.248 --> 24:17.877
know, those men of strategic power, you know, like 
the Infiltration Front and the Communists and all

24:07.248 --> 24:17.877
that. And there's since another day when, you 
know, the Communists, you know, they changed the

24:17.897 --> 24:22.762
tactics. They said, now we attack, you know, we 
declare war with both, you know, the Americans and

24:22.782 --> 24:36.293
then they, the kids, you know, fight with the 
Americans. And they They broke it, you know, they

24:37.336 --> 24:49.089
sent rockets, you know, to those American camps, 
you know, to the rest of the American G.I. So now the

24:49.710 --> 24:59.901
American commander, you know, or whoever field 
commander over there, they cannot, you know, sit

24:49.710 --> 24:59.901
like that, and they just work, you know, they just, 
you know, kill us. see, then we have to spread out,

25:00.269 --> 25:05.235
you know, to protect our area. See, so we have to 
patrol, we have to do operations. But that's it for

25:08.398 --> 25:14.705
every military doctrine will be sent. See, the 
best defense is offense. See, because you're not

25:19.190 --> 25:27.960
sitting there, you know, waiting till they come, 
you know, shooting around and then, you know,

25:19.190 --> 25:27.960
just kill you. So it seems that, it seems that What 
they were really fighting for was just to protect

25:30.256 --> 25:43.892
the different places where people... Well, first 
one, you know, Americans didn't receive, you

25:30.256 --> 25:43.892
know, all, you know, to fight. They would say, 
well, okay, now, if they have been fighting on,

25:44.493 --> 25:52.382
then they can just fight back. But the communists, 
you know, keep attacking the Americans, no

25:52.943 --> 25:59.250
matter, you know, where attack, you know, came, or 
sabotage, you know, the airplane, you know, when

25:59.635 --> 26:08.203
all the Americans were there, the airplane there. 
So, in other words, you know, the communist

26:09.124 --> 26:19.813
situation

26:09.124 --> 26:19.813
directly, you know, confronted with Americans.

26:19.833 --> 26:25.538
So that's why Americans themselves, you know, we 
have to fight them. But, one of the, now, When, you

26:31.006 --> 26:43.722
know, Americans protect those area, but cannot, 
you know, stay, you know, and live in the camp, you

26:31.006 --> 26:43.722
know, until it gets organized, they call local, 
they call the, during the night. So the time has

26:45.164 --> 26:54.415
come, you know, they try, you know, to storm in, or 
they try to overrun those posts with Americans,

26:45.164 --> 26:54.415
you know, and some get killed. Because that's why 
the Seattle Commanders say, well, we have to send

26:54.867 --> 27:08.305
our troops out, you know, to fire them, you know, to 
throw them and kill them. It's not, you know,

27:08.325 --> 27:09.686
they're sitting there waiting. People are not in 
general over there. So that's the way, you know,

27:12.190 --> 27:17.697
America is involved deeply, deeply. Now, you 
talked about in countryside,

27:24.652 --> 27:30.320
Every time, you know, when the American G.I. 
report and that they conduct a question with

27:32.664 --> 27:42.778
Jeremy, okay, and then some area,

27:44.547 --> 28:01.404
American Conduct, you know, there are 
operations, you know, for a couple of areas, like,

27:44.547 --> 28:01.404
you know, in the way, the land, because you have a 
big base, you know, with American G.I. here. So, in

28:01.784 --> 28:14.537
this area, it's American breast surgery, because 
they want to be involved, and they want to be, this

28:01.784 --> 28:14.537
area will be clear all the time, they're sort of 
going, you know, it's just a factor. Of course,

28:15.361 --> 28:27.464
now, when you fight a war,

28:15.361 --> 28:27.464
but a very war, you don't see the enemy. They didn't 
wear the uniform. They're not going to wear the

28:29.187 --> 28:34.737
uniform and fight you in the front line like this. 
They just do snipers and booby traps and things

28:35.510 --> 28:42.164
like that. Now, when the GI conduct operations and 
go to the village, if some guy gets killed by

28:42.865 --> 28:55.932
snipers, you don't know who in the house. Even us, 
people in Germany, in Germany, we couldn't

28:57.295 --> 29:05.104
recognize them. Even among us, because they are 
like you and I, you know, they, you know, they're

29:05.124 --> 29:13.634
just a person shooting, you know. You and I, maybe, 
just take the gun and shoot people, and then just

29:13.654 --> 29:22.864
dip the gun, you know, and then we become 
civilians. This makes an American G.I.D. very

29:25.664 --> 29:29.454
difficult for society to start with. And 
sometimes, you know, you go and do it. I mean, our

29:33.325 --> 29:37.136
people, they see, you know, the congressmen. 
Nobody cares who they know where they are. Because

29:40.462 --> 29:45.168
they don't speak the language.

29:45.188 --> 30:01.891
And that's

29:45.188 --> 30:01.891
why, you know, we call it the joint

29:45.188 --> 30:01.891
army, you know, they had a combined corps. But 
then, you can have, you know, a unit of nine forces.

30:12.119 --> 30:20.523
Imagine there's some area

30:12.119 --> 30:20.523
that's out of our control. And then the companies 
come out. Then maybe it's just only one guy. They go

30:25.062 --> 30:28.025
to the village, you see. They have to begin down, 
they just call a couple of people and do it in the

30:28.666 --> 30:38.176
night, you know, and talk. So they say, okay, now, 
well, they say, well, you see, the Americans, you

30:38.196 --> 30:49.669
know, tried to occupy the land, you know, kill the 
people, you know, you see that, drop the bomb, you

30:38.196 --> 30:49.669
know, dropping that one, you know, kill innocent 
people. I mean, maybe two or three communists, you

30:50.763 --> 30:56.892
know. under the, behind the bush, you know, yeah, 
and just, you know, snipers. I don't know how you

31:03.664 --> 31:06.667
can, how you can deter them. If you don't, if you 
don't, you know, just shoot to those birds, you

31:06.687 --> 31:12.653
know, and you can never get them. But they, they're 
so smart that after they shoot, you know, and they

31:13.213 --> 31:19.259
dig the hole, you know. And it's only, you know, if 
the guy's sitting there in the house, you know, and

31:19.279 --> 31:25.645
they don't know about it. But sometimes they 
really don't know. Yeah. But you can prove

31:28.830 --> 31:38.159
yourself, you know, I saw the people shoot from 
this house. Yeah. You see, so, in every war, you

31:40.141 --> 31:47.468
know, you had, you know, you had innocent people 
killed. See? But, you know

31:47.908 --> 31:54.514
what I'm saying? If Americans was killed, Well, 
maybe the press and the media are just making noise

31:57.031 --> 32:07.142
in the United States. You heard, you know, very 
learned about the Communists knew this type of

32:08.675 --> 32:17.385
tragedy to kill innocent people. And outside, you 
know, in the free world, we had some documents, we

32:17.406 --> 32:37.770
had pictures, so if, you know, the Communists go to 
the village and kill the people, kill, you know,

32:17.406 --> 32:37.770
the government, so, you know, going to the 
government, the village chief, the village

32:17.406 --> 32:37.770
leader, yeah, they kill you, you know, they just 
cut the hand, all right? Well, is it just a photo

32:39.320 --> 32:42.403
example? Yeah. You see, because they say, well, 
and this guy, you know, gives, you know, they call,

32:43.023 --> 32:54.594
you know, the South government puppet, American 
puppet. They say, well, this guy, you know, gives

32:55.214 --> 33:03.982
information from puppet

32:55.214 --> 33:03.982
government, you know. And I said, both sides, you 
know, you have atrocities. You see, when you try to

33:08.058 --> 33:12.663
start a war, it's not, you know, an open war. Yeah. 
You see? And you don't know where the citizens,

33:14.265 --> 33:22.193
where the innocent ones are. You see? And you 
fight, you know, one time you fight a war, but you

33:22.794 --> 33:27.759
fight also the forgiveness, the communist 
forgiveness. Every time you hit one innocent, you

33:27.779 --> 33:32.124
see, the communists, you know, they... They use up 
the money. They use up the forgiveness. But both

33:35.868 --> 33:41.402
sides, you know, and the more, the more, the deeper 
the G.I. go to the countryside, and they freshly

33:41.422 --> 33:52.830
start to talk, sometimes, you know, the British 
people, maybe sometimes they don't like, you

33:41.422 --> 33:52.830
know, they say, well... They didn't know, you 
know, they come, you know, to talk about and about,

33:53.789 --> 34:01.736
you know, destroy my house and this and that, you 
know. But in, in the big city, because the people

34:01.756 --> 34:14.207
understand it, you know, but in the cars and things 
like that, they didn't realize it. You see, for

34:14.227 --> 34:23.796
those people listening, okay, now, if they don't 
care about Congress, they don't care about

34:14.227 --> 34:23.796
Martin, they don't care about the government, 
they said, if they can have peace, But that's the

34:23.776 --> 34:31.784
way the communists promised that. See now, if 
Americans were defeated, or Americans were put

34:31.805 --> 34:49.323
out, you know, we would have peace, and we would be 
happy, you know.

34:49.343 --> 34:49.944
All this because of Americans. It's not, you know. 
Now, in that case also, you know, you can see But

34:54.067 --> 35:04.384
during the time, you know, the war in Vietnam, the 
communists, they think they can win the war in the

34:54.067 --> 35:04.384
United States. They think they can win the war in 
the United States? Yeah. See, because by, you

35:07.088 --> 35:10.855
know, make all those propaganda. Then you can see 
in the United States, you know, you had, you know,

35:10.875 --> 35:18.507
demonstrations, you know, people, you know, 
anti-war, you know, in Vietnam. Demonstration

35:18.527 --> 35:19.669
and everything. Because they feel the 
communists, they can feel a marginal is too,

35:21.050 --> 35:40.429
well, it doesn't work, you know, to send, you know, 
their children, you know, away, you know, in the

35:21.050 --> 35:40.429
525-star world. See, they know well. You see? So, 
if they can, you know, you... But some probably

35:48.353 --> 36:01.525
moved to another country or to the media, and they 
showed a picture of how, you know, Americans, uh,

35:48.353 --> 36:01.525
dechorging house or bombing, you know, things 
like that, you know, in the beginning. And then

36:02.085 --> 36:05.869
this goes to come back to here in the United States. 
And those young students, you know, in the United

36:06.369 --> 36:12.134
States, they didn't know what the communists did. 
They'd just see what I was... Yeah, they just, they

36:12.975 --> 36:18.360
just saw that and said, why, you know, And then you 
had, you know, an anti-war movement in the United

36:18.796 --> 36:25.363
States. Just all this, you know, made it bad enough 
for America to conduct the war. You see? And then

36:34.193 --> 36:36.576
the country was divided, you know. You had, you 
know, demonstrations, you had riots, you know, to

36:36.656 --> 36:45.546
come against the world, you know. See, the 
communists tried the Sam War, you know, like

36:45.796 --> 36:55.147
during the French War also, okay? They tried to 
hit, you know, they had to sympathize, you know, by

36:55.167 --> 37:02.296
the French communists, okay? Now, any secret, you 
know, through the consulate or through the

37:02.316 --> 37:13.609
military consulate or whatever, you know, in 
France, and the communists over there, you know,

37:02.316 --> 37:13.609
they get information. before the French attack, 
you know, every operation, you know, they knew all

37:14.483 --> 37:19.530
this. See, because the Communist Party, you know, 
were in the French government. And now, when the

37:26.020 --> 37:36.475
Americans tried to work there, they had the same 
tactics they used. See, they tried to make people

37:36.775 --> 37:49.033
in the United States resent about this war, you 
know, be tensed about this war, hate about this

37:36.775 --> 37:49.033
war, you know. See, by demonstration, to make the 
government, you know, turn the march and change

37:49.053 --> 37:55.903
all decisions. So that was the compass, you know, 
that said, well, you know, we send money and we

37:55.923 --> 38:03.694
send... Actually, in Vietnam, in the war between 
we...

38:03.826 --> 38:32.871
Well, like I said, you know, the Vietnamese, they 
fight because they knew And they knew the

38:34.049 --> 38:43.020
Communists, you know, they couldn't live under 
the Communists, because of the Communists

38:34.049 --> 38:43.020
there's no freedom. The Communists is just, you 
know, a big concentration camp. So that's why they

38:47.185 --> 38:50.088
fought. So you think they were fighting just 
against Communism? Yeah. You see, that's why in

38:54.533 --> 38:59.179
all of Saudi Arabia now, you know, people are 
fighting. But of course, I tell you, you know, like

39:01.218 --> 39:13.594
right now, in the countryside, you know, far away, 
you know, people doesn't have enough

39:01.218 --> 39:13.594
information. See, and even now, you know, they get 
maybe the print watch, you know, by the

39:14.896 --> 39:21.284
communists. So they think, you know, if the 
communists come, there will be... uh, more happy,

39:24.775 --> 39:33.805
uh, communism provides, you know, more, uh, 
change of the media, you see. But you can, you can

39:33.825 --> 39:48.923
see now with all these, okay, uh, you see, when the 
communists take over the country, you can see how

39:33.825 --> 39:48.923
many Vietnamese are in the country, you see. We do 
have the same also before, you know, when the, the

39:48.943 --> 39:54.529
country was divided in two parts, Yeah. Okay, we 
have, you know, about a million, almost two

39:55.690 --> 40:00.980
million people living in the north. See, they 
cannot stay in the north. Well, they left the north

40:05.308 --> 40:07.352
to the south. Well, they left the north,

40:07.612 --> 40:13.523
you know, they just moved to the south. Okay, those 
people, you know, more or less, you know, employee

40:13.543 --> 40:18.913
government, see, And it worked, you know, in the 
city. See, because they knew, you know, what the

40:22.818 --> 40:25.500
freedom is. They knew the economy, what the 
economy was. Yeah. Okay. But the farmers, they

40:30.244 --> 40:33.747
have nothing to do. You see, they don't care.

40:40.233 --> 40:44.376
You see, like, okay, like, actually, you know, 
okay, it's a farmer. You see, it's like, okay, now,

40:44.957 --> 40:48.580
if I work for the government, I pray tax. See, 
everything I have to do, I have to attach to the

40:49.690 --> 40:54.196
government. See now, the Communists will do the 
same. The Communists maybe take more. They don't

41:01.186 --> 41:10.659
let them, you know, enough for their own, you know, 
because they have to, everything they grow, you

41:01.186 --> 41:10.659
know, they have to sell to the corporations, what 
they call it. But, they say, well, at least, you

41:10.679 --> 41:15.225
know, I don't have the war. Yeah. See, I can, I can 
work on my film, you know. On your own land? Yeah.

41:21.583 --> 41:21.764
See? But that's the way the, the people living, you 
know, far countryside, they think.

41:32.554 --> 41:32.975
Right. But until the day, you know, when they had, 
you know, one communist come in the village and ask

41:32.995 --> 41:46.208
them, you know, to do something, or they knew this 
village, you know, had somebody, or maybe had the,

41:32.995 --> 41:46.208
uh, sons, you know, with, uh, And you know, like in 
the United States, there are a lot of different

41:46.593 --> 42:00.808
views like this. The hawks,

42:01.429 --> 42:09.357
you know what that is? The hawks are probably, they 
believe that we are. Not because the Vietnamese

42:16.293 --> 42:23.363
people are behind us, but because the American 
public was there. Then you've got the Daoists who

42:23.804 --> 42:32.115
believe that we could never have won the war 
because the Vietnamese people weren't behind it,

42:23.804 --> 42:32.115
and then you've got the counterinsurgency. You 
heard of that? Yeah, I heard of it. Wow. Did those

42:36.401 --> 42:39.786
type of ideas exist in Vietnam too? Now, in 
Vietnam, we don't have this much of that, because

42:39.766 --> 42:48.274
in Vietnam, we said, okay, You know, you find the 
family, or you become slave to the family, you

42:50.397 --> 42:57.488
know. So you don't have, you know, you don't have 
picture. But some people try to, you know, to say,

43:03.217 --> 43:10.849
well, maybe we can get along somehow, but they, 
they, they don't know. You see, actually, it's

43:10.869 --> 43:12.692
like to be a liberation song, for a time, you know. 
Okay, most of those cards there, when the

43:12.672 --> 43:23.644
combination will take over, those guys, you know, 
they bring them down. So there is really just one

43:24.164 --> 43:27.712
people that were amongst the people? Yeah. Other 
than that, you know, I don't think that we don't

43:28.333 --> 43:31.680
have to... I've lived, you know, in the city. We 
tell you what, either we win the communist or we

43:33.284 --> 43:37.373
die, that's all. Yeah. We don't have to. There is no 
question of it. No question of it. This is

43:40.199 --> 43:42.865
really... because those who go... because a lot of 
the movements, you know, yeah, demonstrate, you

43:43.621 --> 43:56.341
know, against the war, so we can have a lot of, a lot 
of dull people. Because actually dull people,

43:56.361 --> 44:07.139
maybe they do know, you know, what's the danger, 
the danger of this war, because they don't need to

43:56.361 --> 44:07.139
understand it. Because a merchant has a very a very 
weak idea about what was the

44:09.102 --> 44:17.872
communism. Okay. Or what it was like under 
communism. Yeah. You see, in school, you know,

44:21.096 --> 44:28.384
most of the school doesn't know much about 
communism. Yeah. You see, even when I, okay, now,

44:31.248 --> 44:37.455
when those, you know, the kids, you know, they come 
home, But then maybe 75% of them can have the

44:38.330 --> 44:54.588
economy,

44:38.330 --> 44:54.588
you know, or you speak to them, you know, talk to 
them. Maybe you have maybe one or two guys in there

44:54.608 --> 45:00.175
because they say it's scary, you know, and then 
that's how we take most of the economy, you know,

44:54.608 --> 45:00.175
the economy. It's scary.

45:05.621 --> 45:05.721
Yeah. Because I think the dose, you know, in the 
United States of it, I don't know, it goes back

45:05.971 --> 45:27.291
maybe because it goes back, you know,

45:05.971 --> 45:27.291
in the United States of it. The thing is, when 
President Nixon So, we're

45:30.507 --> 45:41.218
still decreasing the fighting? Yeah, because 
they're so, you know, they're infiltration. You

45:52.389 --> 45:57.915
see, because they're so, they think, you know, in 
my view, are making those lands now, they're not

45:58.739 --> 46:07.652
here now. So they're starting to kind of flip it a 
little bit. To be fine on the ground. But the thing

46:15.543 --> 46:19.509
is, you know, that's too much. In the United 
States, you know, did you hit, you know, Pearl when

46:20.410 --> 46:25.718
you hit the count? And most of the congressmen, 
opposed the war because too much, you know, human

46:28.827 --> 46:42.499
life involved, too many lost G.I.Q.s. And that's 
why the Congress, the United States Congress, you

46:42.519 --> 46:50.046
know, was divided because due to those movements, 
you know, and the war. And then the Congress

46:51.167 --> 46:58.193
decided, well, we cannot win the war. At that time, 
because, you know, this is, you know, seeing the

46:59.540 --> 47:12.313
China, you know, be getting, you know, into the 
war, yeah, into the war with, uh, with America, you

46:59.540 --> 47:12.313
know. So, uh, Americans think, you know, well, we 
just start to find, you know, a good thing with

47:13.234 --> 47:21.562
South Vietnam. But the North, you know, keeps, you 
know, sending troops down. You know, we try to

47:26.843 --> 47:33.445
bombard, you know, the whole chimney dwellers, we 
think, you know, during the day and during the

47:26.843 --> 47:33.445
night.
