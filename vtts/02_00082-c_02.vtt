WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:08.736
regular old woodchairs and then you would, they would go do their thing and then you would leave.

00:09.297 --> 00:15.783
And a lot of the guys, you know, like if you had the money I guess you could do it, you wouldn't.

00:16.344 --> 00:17.565
And there was another place too.

00:18.486 --> 00:18.726
Where?

00:19.247 --> 00:22.530
Where is it?

00:25.052 --> 00:25.413
Brenham?

00:25.933 --> 00:26.494
Is that right?

00:26.514 --> 00:27.034
I think so.

00:27.555 --> 00:30.898
Now there was nothing like that anywhere close to Brian, was there?

00:31.013 --> 00:31.354
No.

00:31.694 --> 00:32.515
I've never heard of him.

00:32.535 --> 00:32.716
No.

00:33.276 --> 00:34.458
No, there wasn't anything like that.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.965
And, because the Air Force Base had closed down.

00:39.466 --> 00:39.726
Right.

00:40.307 --> 00:41.869
They weren't even using it.

00:41.989 --> 00:44.333
Maybe the Engineering Extension Service, somebody.

00:47.878 --> 00:49.761
Where were the places to drink beer?

00:51.143 --> 00:59.215
Oh, there was some over there by New Main, you know, the administration, there was a couple of bars there.

00:59.785 --> 01:04.813
We would go to Bryan, you know, mainly when you had to be, they watched you pretty close, you know.

01:05.494 --> 01:07.056
So you had to really kind of be 21.

01:07.196 --> 01:15.228
I remember when we were seniors coming back for our senior year that there was the Texan, that's a restaurant, that was a hangout for us.

01:15.248 --> 01:19.034
We used to go there, eat pizza, have a couple of beers, just drive-in at that time.

01:19.855 --> 01:24.682
And there was another place that was kind of a drive-in type place that we would go to.

01:24.702 --> 01:28.067
Was Uncle Ed's operating on Welburn Road then?

01:28.628 --> 01:29.269
Hard Liquor's?

01:30.143 --> 01:31.144
No.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.587
Not that I don't think so, I don't remember that.

01:33.607 --> 01:34.768
It had earlier.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.113
What did, what were people smoking then?

01:41.857 --> 01:48.284
Pall Mall, Camels, Lucky Strikes, Chesterfield.

01:49.085 --> 01:51.448
Did an undergraduate smoke cigars?

01:53.050 --> 01:53.270
No.

01:53.771 --> 01:55.092
Undergraduates couldn't even smoke.

01:55.393 --> 01:57.535
If you were a freshman it wasn't a privilege to smoke.

01:57.835 --> 02:04.207
If you were a sophomore, it was a privilege to smoke only in the dorm, or you couldn't smoke anyplace else.

02:04.227 --> 02:07.252
And was, did students smoke pipes?

02:07.854 --> 02:08.555
Yes, some did.

02:08.735 --> 02:12.141
Mainly when they got up to the junior, senior level, they, you know.

02:12.162 --> 02:14.326
Did they chew tobacco or smell?

02:14.346 --> 02:15.668
Not much, not much.

02:16.309 --> 02:18.874
What did y'all know about marijuana or heroin?

02:19.014 --> 02:19.455
Nothing.

02:20.110 --> 02:21.572
Did you ever even know?

02:21.692 --> 02:22.573
No, nothing.

02:22.773 --> 02:24.796
I mean it was just not in existence.

02:25.136 --> 02:26.358
That's right.

02:26.378 --> 02:45.662
I think the worst thing that ever happened, well it's not going to be the worst, but one of the things that happened to us was when I was a senior the commandant came out with a memo telling us that we were using, foul language had to be cut down and so we had to make sure that everybody started

02:46.013 --> 02:47.035
contain themselves.

02:47.155 --> 02:59.876
And we were in the hallways and they were reading the memo and I remember one of the seniors saying, he was going to say, oh, you know, and he says, oh, doo-doo.

03:02.040 --> 03:06.106
So yeah, that's, no.

03:06.547 --> 03:08.931
We're getting fairly near the end now.

03:09.833 --> 03:12.477
Silver Taps talk about, did you go to muster?

03:12.541 --> 03:13.883
Yes, it was required.

03:14.143 --> 03:15.706
Where was it held?

03:16.046 --> 03:20.653
It was held, actually, they held it at different places.

03:20.733 --> 03:28.043
We had it at Jolly Raleigh, and then we also had it out in the drill field in front of the student center.

03:29.245 --> 03:32.370
So it was between those two places mostly.

03:32.510 --> 03:34.713
Did that touch your... Mustard?

03:34.893 --> 03:35.574
Oh, definitely.

03:35.915 --> 03:42.244
Yeah, because it was, you know, another experience that, you know, I've gone to...

03:42.477 --> 03:49.484
I mean those type of things at A&M are like, I guess they are a big tradition.

03:50.405 --> 03:52.187
And it just passes on down.

03:52.287 --> 04:03.620
It's just like you as a former student try to pass on these things to your brothers, sisters, nephews, kids, you know.

04:04.120 --> 04:08.525
It's just some of those things that affected you that made you an Aggie.

04:09.406 --> 04:10.287
You were going to be an Aggie.

04:10.307 --> 04:11.488
I mean this is it.

04:11.890 --> 04:19.777
What are the other parts of that same kind of contribution?

04:20.458 --> 04:22.960
Are there some other events that pull people together?

04:24.001 --> 04:34.431
As far as, because of being an Aggie, I'd say, you know, the idea of the ring is a big thing when you're a senior.

04:34.852 --> 04:36.133
How much did yours cost?

04:36.153 --> 04:37.975
Oh, I think I paid $35 for it.

04:38.095 --> 04:39.576
Where'd you get the money?

04:39.796 --> 04:41.678
My mother and father, you know.

04:42.097 --> 04:48.567
I think this ring was maybe $130, $70, $80 maybe, and the Formancy Association paid for half of it.

04:48.808 --> 04:50.490
How did you feel when you put it on?

04:50.510 --> 04:51.091
Oh, God.

04:51.312 --> 04:57.561
That was just like putting on senior boots, you know, when you find a review when you're a senior and you put those boots on.

04:59.024 --> 05:07.497
I guess the biggest satisfaction you have is when you become a junior and you get to wear that serge uniform, which was a lot different back then because it was custom made.

05:08.084 --> 05:12.007
And I didn't buy them, you know, I bought them from somebody else.

05:12.948 --> 05:20.255
And I bought my boots from somebody else because my mother was really upset about it because she wanted me to buy the Hollicks boots.

05:20.315 --> 05:23.698
And I did have a pair of Hollicks boots, but I bought them from a senior that was graduating.

05:24.338 --> 05:26.120
And I paid him $35 for the boots.

05:27.521 --> 05:29.082
At that time I think the boots ran about $150.

05:29.102 --> 05:31.424
Did you keep the boots?

05:31.464 --> 05:32.725
Yeah, I still have them in my den.

05:32.745 --> 05:36.228
I have my campaign hat and my boots in my den.

05:36.429 --> 05:37.610
Have you ever lost your ring?

05:37.650 --> 05:37.990
No.

05:38.459 --> 05:42.968
Do you have any ring stories of where somebody, you're somewhere and somebody notices it?

05:43.208 --> 05:43.970
Oh, yeah.

05:43.990 --> 05:44.571
Yeah.

05:44.591 --> 05:44.731
Sure.

05:44.832 --> 05:45.232
Everywhere.

05:45.473 --> 05:45.693
Sure.

05:45.713 --> 05:57.717
I mean, uh, uh, Florida, uh, then in a restaurant and, uh, this gentleman was in there and I noticed he had an A&M ring and, and, uh,

05:58.456 --> 06:01.100
And it was just like we, right away, you know.

06:01.641 --> 06:04.084
Airports, one of the greatest places to meet Aggies.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.267
Airports is one of the greatest places to meet Aggies.

06:06.347 --> 06:23.552
And I remember I've met a lot of Aggies in airports, airplanes, social functions away from San Antonio and California, Colorado, God, name it, you know, Canada.

06:24.342 --> 06:32.551
Your final review, your senior year, who came to see you at final review and commencement?

06:32.571 --> 06:36.134
Well, final review was the same day as commencement.

06:36.835 --> 06:49.168
And my parents came, my brother, his wife, my sister, her husband.

06:51.511 --> 06:54.875
That's about all that I can recall that came to graduation.

06:55.035 --> 06:59.240
And for them, it was a sacrifice to make these trips.

06:59.901 --> 07:01.202
They would only come up here to A&M.

07:01.242 --> 07:04.446
It's not like parents coming up here every weekend.

07:04.926 --> 07:08.551
They would only make the trip like, I think they came to two Texas games here.

07:08.591 --> 07:13.616
And they would always make, we used to call it Mother's Day.

07:14.377 --> 07:16.820
And that's the only two trips they made.

07:17.221 --> 07:18.302
And that was it.

07:18.322 --> 07:19.403
That was it.

07:19.423 --> 07:21.045
And then when I graduated, of course.

07:21.768 --> 07:24.912
And the name was called, Hand Was Shaken.

07:26.253 --> 07:27.875
How did you feel when you had that diploma?

07:27.895 --> 07:30.078
Well, I was glad to get the hell out of here.

07:30.098 --> 07:31.360
But then I was sad, you know.

07:31.380 --> 07:43.034
I mean, it was like when we had Final Review and you're standing there and you're singing Auld Lang Syne, you know, it's like, God, you know, this is, they didn't do it quite the same as they do it today.

07:43.094 --> 07:51.724
You would go back and give the time to the underclassmen to change the new uniform.

07:52.042 --> 07:56.128
And then the seniors that sold their boots, of course, they'd have to go back.

07:56.148 --> 07:57.830
Because there was a lot of boot selling.

07:57.850 --> 08:00.934
There wasn't, like, people going over to Hollicks and ordering boots all the time.

08:01.796 --> 08:07.263
And so they'd take their boots off, come back in just regular uniform.

08:08.004 --> 08:14.674
And so they'd gather around you on the drill field, and every outfit would sing Au Lang Syne, and you wish you well.

08:14.694 --> 08:19.180
And then you'd get up and line up and march forward, and then they'd go by, and that was it.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.170
It was sad, you know, you cried, couldn't help it, you know.

08:24.131 --> 08:27.795
Leaving the dorm when I went back to, because I mean it all happened so fast.

08:28.296 --> 08:47.057
It was like in one day, I mean you were like stripped, you know, you were a senior, you've been here four years, you go to commencement, you get your degree, you're excited about that, you come back with it in your hand and you want to show it to everybody, you know, and you go through those, dorms used to have these

08:47.037 --> 09:03.955
these lounge areas, and I remember coming through there with it, and there were some parents there with some kids, and they stopped me, and they wanted to see it, and they told me, of course, the little freshman at that time, look, this is where you can be a few years from now.

09:03.975 --> 09:14.125
So, I mean, it was exciting, and then when you went to the drill field and all that, then it was sad, and then when you went back to the dorm and you started loading up your car,

09:15.168 --> 09:24.937
then it got sadder, you know, because you're leaving behind a lot of buddies where they're underclassmen, and yeah, yeah, it was sad, very sad.

09:25.478 --> 09:32.184
How well prepared did you think A&M had made you for your future at that point?

09:32.224 --> 09:33.325
I felt very confident.

09:33.786 --> 09:42.213
I felt that I, you know, that I would find or do or whatever I, you know, I wasn't afraid to go out and look for a job.

09:42.614 --> 09:43.875
I felt confident that

09:44.108 --> 09:49.894
I had been prepared well enough to do whatever I wound up doing.

09:50.555 --> 09:53.117
Actually, I wound up working for the State Comptroller.

09:53.137 --> 09:56.100
It was my first job, and I was a state auditor for three and a half years.

09:56.381 --> 09:59.464
Because I had taken enough accounting hours, so they gave me this test.

09:59.484 --> 10:02.147
I passed it, and I said, well, okay.

10:02.207 --> 10:09.214
So they called me in for another interview, and they told me, well, we really want to send you to Dallas.

10:09.274 --> 10:13.018
And I said, I really didn't want to go to Dallas.

10:13.437 --> 10:16.200
They said, well, we need, can you speak Spanish?

10:16.360 --> 10:16.841
They asked me.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.082
I said, yes, sir, I can.

10:18.923 --> 10:19.504
He says, good.

10:19.704 --> 10:20.965
Then we'll send you to San Antonio.

10:20.985 --> 10:21.927
Of course, that's where I lived.

10:22.607 --> 10:26.712
Because the sales tax had just been put into effect.

10:26.952 --> 10:28.194
The law had just gone into effect.

10:28.614 --> 10:33.119
Maybe it was a couple of years in already, and they needed sales tax auditors.

10:34.260 --> 10:35.822
So that was easy tax to audit.

10:35.862 --> 10:37.264
But then they trained you in the other areas.

10:37.284 --> 10:39.867
But that was my first job.

10:41.268 --> 10:42.870
I think they prepared me very well.

10:42.935 --> 10:52.263
All right, as you look back now on these 40 years since then, what did you learn at A&M that's been important to you?

10:52.523 --> 11:02.672
I think what I learned at A&M was actually carried from my family on to what it developed.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.155
In other words, developing your mind or your intellect.

11:07.156 --> 11:12.300
I think my parents did a good job of doing that.

11:13.462 --> 11:21.012
family, honor, integrity, those things were like a code here, you know.

11:21.032 --> 11:23.716
I mean, it's part of what life's about.

11:24.637 --> 11:29.104
And I think my parents did a good job of all that, and I just developed those.

11:29.484 --> 11:32.568
Develop your body, you know, health, those type of things.

11:33.209 --> 11:35.132
I mean, those are things that

11:35.517 --> 11:56.250
Your parents always looked out for you, but when they sent you here, you developed it to a higher level so that when you, when I left here, whatever I learned and whatever I attained, my daughter and she can see what's, she wanted to attain the same thing.

11:56.310 --> 11:57.452
I mean, it's just going to continue.

11:57.472 --> 12:03.381
It's like you said, first generation and your kids behind you are going to follow.

12:03.530 --> 12:05.473
My wife has a college degree.

12:05.513 --> 12:06.174
She's a teacher.

12:06.915 --> 12:14.287
And so, I mean, it's just like we set pace for our kids, you know, for a better life.

12:14.908 --> 12:18.954
Did A&M prepare you well to work with a wide variety of people?

12:19.054 --> 12:20.456
Well, I think it's one of the best things they did.

12:21.378 --> 12:30.432
I think because I was in sales and marketing for a long time, and I went from a sales rep with a national company all the way to a division manager.

12:31.019 --> 12:47.623
And I think I had the abilities that A&M taught me to be able to handle people, to deal with people, and I guess keep my cool even if I was in situations, handle pressure situations.

12:48.104 --> 12:52.530
And I think those were all part of what I learned in being in the Corps and then being here at A&M.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.073
I think that's what it did.

12:55.214 --> 12:57.457
All right, now we're looking to the future.

12:57.618 --> 12:59.220
If you were the consultant,

13:00.010 --> 13:06.919
to Texas A&M's decision makers about the future of this institution, what advice would you give them?

13:09.922 --> 13:13.207
What should A&M do or not do?

13:13.407 --> 13:15.049
I'm a big believer of the Corps Cadets.

13:16.711 --> 13:22.819
I feel that in a way we've let that kind of get out.

13:22.839 --> 13:26.423
I think that the administration should have more involvement with

13:27.027 --> 13:30.331
with certain activities that students have on the campus.

13:30.351 --> 13:30.992
I'll give you an example.

13:31.032 --> 13:36.338
Bonfire, I think we should have been watching these kids a little closer.

13:36.378 --> 13:43.466
It's understandable that it's a student activity, but still they have to have supervision.

13:43.546 --> 13:50.554
These young people are 18, 19, 20 years old, and they do have a tendency to have a wild hair, you know, so they'll do things that are not right.

13:51.108 --> 14:03.365
I'm amazed at some of the things that they've done with like bonfire, the bonfire like these little rituals that they've had that they've developed over the years.

14:03.405 --> 14:14.460
And I think it's been a combination of the Corps of Cadets and also I think it's been a combination of fraternities and sororities and stuff that they pulled.

14:14.500 --> 14:20.929
So they kind of combined them and they've done some things that wouldn't have been allowable during bonfire when I was here.

14:21.398 --> 14:23.041
I think that was one thing.

14:23.082 --> 14:32.021
I think I would tell them if they're going to go build another bonfire, they need to make regiment and make sure that there's a lot of supervision on the situation.

14:32.963 --> 14:36.049
As far as the corps cadets is concerned, I think that

14:36.434 --> 14:47.212
We need to kind of look at the core as if we do not want this university, we want to keep the university in the same way as far as the traditions and that type of situation.

14:47.813 --> 14:58.010
They need to keep, they need to try to build up the core to where, say it could be, talk about 3,000.

14:58.491 --> 15:01.075
If they could get it to that point, I think that would be good.

15:01.055 --> 15:13.835
I think they need to supervise the Corps a lot closer and not let them not have the, I know that the Bulls when we were here used to, you never knew when they were going to come into the dormitory area.

15:14.376 --> 15:16.179
And I hear that they don't do that anymore.

15:16.559 --> 15:24.071
And so you don't tell them what a young man will do between 10.30 and 6 o'clock the next morning, you know.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.935
So that would be part of my advice to them.

15:27.116 --> 15:29.239
I feel that, I mean,

15:29.624 --> 15:40.312
I know what we're trying to attain as a first, and we are a flagship university, but I think we're missing students that could make it through this school.

15:42.016 --> 15:44.663
How large should the enrollment become?

15:45.132 --> 15:50.442
Well, being working in government relations, I think that the enrollment can't get any bigger.

15:51.424 --> 15:55.111
We probably are pretty well capped at where we're at.

15:55.272 --> 15:58.859
How does A&M then select who should be in that enrollment?

15:59.780 --> 16:06.313
It's a very difficult decision for them to make, and I feel badly for them because I know that they have to deal with that

16:06.682 --> 16:15.313
during this time of the year and parents that are upset with the fact that their son didn't get into school or their daughter didn't get into school.

16:15.353 --> 16:16.996
I mean, it's a very difficult situation.

16:17.536 --> 16:25.787
If the legislature would leave us alone to a point, I mean, legacy could play a little better role than what it has in the past.

16:26.358 --> 16:32.988
that we have to remember that you talked about Bumbright's nephew, or was it grandson, right?

16:33.689 --> 16:34.089
Grandson.

16:34.931 --> 16:38.556
And we should have a little flexibility in those areas.

16:39.537 --> 16:40.619
I'll give you another example.

16:40.659 --> 16:44.865
Senator Wentworth's son couldn't get in here, but he finally got in.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.768
He was on the waiting list.

16:46.788 --> 16:53.378
Those type of decisions I think the president should be able to make, and he should be able to say, OK, I'm going to cut that one off.

16:53.398 --> 16:55.521
I'm going to bring him in, you know, that type of deal.

16:55.923 --> 17:01.689
And I think that they should have a little more flexibility in that area.

17:02.210 --> 17:05.534
The guy, the young man, he had the grades.

17:05.594 --> 17:07.556
He had the SAT score.

17:07.796 --> 17:09.398
He went to Alamo Heights High School.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.923
The credentials are there.

17:14.303 --> 17:22.993
And just because maybe he didn't have a community service hour that another person had or the activity that another person had,

17:23.665 --> 17:30.914
We should kind of, I know that they grade to I guess to 100 and so many things give you so many points.

17:30.955 --> 17:33.678
So it's a tough situation.

17:36.782 --> 17:47.096
If you look, as you look back, to what people relating to A&M do you feel most grateful that helped you?

17:49.218 --> 17:50.500
Well I was here.

17:51.391 --> 18:05.897
I'd say I had a lot of good professors, and they were all very, I mean, they were there to do their job, and they did their job, but I think professors, upperclassmen, I have to say that upperclassmen helped me out a lot.

18:06.257 --> 18:10.024
I think the people in the

18:10.460 --> 18:20.034
in the military, like the TAC officers and the PMS&Ts, the Commandant, I think they all played a role because they were role models for us.

18:20.275 --> 18:26.865
And that part of it, while I was here in school, outside, former students.

18:27.245 --> 18:36.940
Former students, of course, going out, meeting, say, being associated with A&M organizations and

18:37.544 --> 18:46.494
And networking with, you know, the thing that I felt that the association here should have done a long time ago, talking about the network, should have been doing that 20 years ago.

18:47.295 --> 18:58.748
And for some reason or other, we kind of are in our own world as A&M people, and we feel that everybody should know about us, but we don't go out and market it.

19:00.209 --> 19:06.977
So the end result is that you get outside of Texas, a lot of people won't know about A&M.

19:07.447 --> 19:15.855
I mean, it's not like a Notre Dame that they know about a Notre Dame, and even though they may not know all the traditions about it, they have an idea, you know, and A&M they don't.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.418
Next and last question.

19:18.438 --> 19:18.738
Okay.

19:18.999 --> 19:27.827
If you could make a major gift to A&M, if you had the fiscal capability, for what purpose would you make that gift?

19:29.950 --> 19:31.751
It would be in different areas.

19:33.253 --> 19:35.395
What would they?

19:36.758 --> 19:38.983
helping diversifying the campus.

19:39.444 --> 19:48.044
That would be one of my gifts, is trying to see if we could promote and get more minority students into the school.

19:48.124 --> 19:55.982
We need to raise that number, and it's only for the benefit of the university, too, because eventually, I mean, the numbers are changing real fast.

19:57.076 --> 20:01.401
The other would be to the Corps of Cadets.

20:01.822 --> 20:07.429
It would be the organization making sure that we keep it alive.

20:07.689 --> 20:12.335
That would be my second gift.

20:12.355 --> 20:15.038
And my third gift would be to one of the schools.

20:15.118 --> 20:21.546
I mean, I'm thinking like maybe the business school or that type of situation.

20:21.566 --> 20:24.450
That's where I think I would do it.

20:24.953 --> 20:30.383
Last question, what feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M?

20:31.025 --> 20:32.187
Oh, there's no better school.

20:32.367 --> 20:34.231
I mean, there's no greater university for me.

20:34.331 --> 20:42.186
I mean, it's, I'm called, I mean, I've never, I've always talked

20:42.166 --> 21:02.519
about A&M and what it's about, even with the company that I work with, everybody knew I was an Aggie and everybody said, man, this guy's a fanatic Aggie, you know, and a lot of young people that, younger than me, that, you know, have gone on to get married and I've served as the best man in a couple of their weddings.

21:03.280 --> 21:09.490
One of them gave me a real nice gift that I'll always keep, besides the one my roommate gave me, but

21:09.993 --> 21:17.465
The one that this young man gave me was that he gave me this clock, and it says, an Aggie's Aggie.

21:18.567 --> 21:24.977
And, well, you know, those kind of things are, I mean, there's no better university.

21:24.997 --> 21:29.284
I mean, I love it, regardless of what happens.
