WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:06.161
The sky was already, the air was already full of things going back and forth.

00:06.521 --> 00:10.007
And so we had no choice but to get behind our table and turn it over and we had to respond.

00:10.809 --> 00:17.680
And this went on for a few minutes and about time everybody at our table figured it probably good to get out of there.

00:17.701 --> 00:21.307
So we boogied out the door and about time we're heading out the door, the KKs are coming the other way.

00:21.848 --> 00:24.452
But this was a hell of a food fight.

00:24.972 --> 00:40.906
One of the other things talking about this is I can remember when in my freshman year and my junior year and senior year in the court area, in the spring, you'd be coming out of Duncan, going back to the dorm, and you'd hear people start yelling water fight.

00:42.448 --> 00:52.937
And you'd get back to your dorm, and hellacious water fights would break out between the different sides, the Air Force side, the aircraft side, and the Army, the ground pounder side of the quad.

00:53.491 --> 00:55.974
And you'd even prepare for these things.

00:57.516 --> 01:02.062
In the dorms, there used to be radiator pipes that ran on both sides of the windows.

01:03.043 --> 01:09.651
And what you would do is get bicycle inner tubes.

01:09.671 --> 01:12.575
And you'd get multiple elements and stretch them together and build a pocket in them.

01:12.595 --> 01:15.258
And you could stretch those things almost all the way back to the door.

01:16.259 --> 01:22.367
And you'd get a water balloon and put it in there, and you could aim it right, and you could launch it all the way across the quad.

01:23.478 --> 01:31.577
So you get three or more guys, they pull this thing back, they put the balloon in and let it go, and you see these water balloons just fly it all the way across the quad to the next one.

01:31.617 --> 01:36.087
And of course, people were running down there with buckets of water and everything else.

01:37.653 --> 01:39.956
I mean, those water fights were just tremendous.

01:40.076 --> 01:41.757
And there wasn't a whole lot of interference.

01:41.798 --> 01:45.882
I guess the faculty figured it was a way to let the core blow off steam or something like that.

01:46.102 --> 01:47.163
And nobody ever got hurt.

01:47.264 --> 01:47.944
Nobody ever got hurt.

01:48.285 --> 01:48.785
I mean, no.

01:48.925 --> 01:51.708
I mean, you know, maybe somebody would fall down or something and that sort of stuff.

01:51.748 --> 01:53.931
But this was not a, this was the fun of it.

01:54.692 --> 02:00.358
And, but my senior year, we had a water fight going.

02:00.398 --> 02:01.399
We were in dorm four.

02:02.493 --> 02:12.784
We had a water fight going on, and we had one of the big trash cans full of water on top of the dorm, on top of the end of the dorm that's towards the center of the quad.

02:14.025 --> 02:16.648
And we're sitting on top of the dorm, and we're waiting for some target.

02:17.309 --> 02:24.076
And there was the officer OD that day from the Trigon, and the cadet officer of the day.

02:24.136 --> 02:30.323
This lieutenant from the Trigon was not an Aggie, and had decided he was going to stop the water fight.

02:30.708 --> 02:32.050
Bad judgment.

02:33.392 --> 02:45.150
So he comes in and just so happens he's walking down the center of the quad and cuts across the grass right at the edge of dorm four to go in towards dorm six.

02:45.330 --> 02:51.399
And that was a bad decision because we're up on top of the dorm with this 55 gallon trash can full of water.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.664
And we just emptied it over the side.

02:55.225 --> 02:56.226
And you know,

02:56.408 --> 03:02.857
You lose a lot of authority in uniform when you're all wet.

03:02.877 --> 03:07.383
I don't know who that guy was or where he is today or anything, but we unloaded that thing on him.

03:07.403 --> 03:11.349
And, of course, we disappeared off the roof after that time, you know, so they never found us.

03:11.449 --> 03:14.934
But that was a fun moment.

03:15.715 --> 03:20.041
And how long before you and your buddies discovered steam tunnels?

03:20.702 --> 03:21.423
Oh, freshman year.

03:22.004 --> 03:24.407
Freshman year, absolutely freshman year.

03:26.024 --> 03:27.706
And then throughout the whole time we did that.

03:27.726 --> 03:29.748
We had one guy by the name of CB Wilson.

03:30.749 --> 03:34.833
Yeah, Kerry Wilson, who was an expert at the steam tunnels.

03:35.314 --> 03:39.819
And we would all go down in the steam tunnels and go all over the campus and discover and everything else.

03:40.840 --> 03:48.028
And one of the interesting things about the steam tunnel is you could turn off the water and the electricity to the dorm in the steam tunnels.

03:48.668 --> 03:51.171
And our fish year, I think it was dorm eight.

03:52.045 --> 04:00.621
or dorm 10, can't remember, that was, their outfit was really close to us in standings in the core.

04:01.282 --> 04:04.367
And it was a Saturday morning before a standby inspection.

04:05.069 --> 04:10.479
And we went down there into their dorm at like 4 o'clock in the morning and turned off all our water and all our electricity.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.526
So their alarm clocks didn't go off and all that stuff.

04:16.278 --> 04:22.687
How far, as far as you know, how far could you go in the steam tunnel?

04:22.707 --> 04:24.769
Oh, shoot, you could go all over campus in the steam tunnels.

04:25.450 --> 04:31.759
I mean, you could go, oh, man, we got really lost sometimes and found our way out.

04:31.779 --> 04:35.264
But, yeah, you could go almost all over campus in the steam tunnels in those days.

04:35.284 --> 04:37.166
Now, where did you all enter the steam tunnel?

04:37.306 --> 04:42.093
We'd entered in the dorm, right there at the stairwell in dorm 12 at the bottom.

04:42.113 --> 04:43.635
You could get in the steam tunnels right there.

04:44.358 --> 04:47.863
I've noticed that they've got them all locked off now and everything else.

04:48.565 --> 04:53.272
One of the other interesting things we did is there was another outfit situation like this we wanted to get out.

04:54.033 --> 05:06.993
And so we went down into the steam tunnel and turned off all the water and then had some guys go up in the dorm and take the caps off of all the urinals and then go back down and turn the water on.

05:08.095 --> 05:10.118
Some of these were geysers in the dorms there.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.542
And then that, and then,

05:13.518 --> 05:14.599
God, who was it?

05:15.821 --> 05:17.302
Oh, the water, I can remember it.

05:17.322 --> 05:19.805
The water, we had gotten back and seen it later on.

05:19.825 --> 05:28.134
The water would come down, and whoever that poor sucker was, there used to be, there aren't anymore, but there used to be rooms across from the bottom of the stairs.

05:28.995 --> 05:33.460
I think they turned those into little vending machine areas now, that sort of stuff.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.643
That poor sucker had lived at the bottom stoop, at the bottom of the stairs.

05:36.763 --> 05:40.908
I mean, water just flowed right into his room.

05:40.928 --> 05:42.850
Oh, one other store, one other store, side of it.

05:43.589 --> 05:54.587
Talking about stretching bicycle inner tubes off of those pipes, we have a piss head that did give us a lot of trouble on our fish here.

05:56.470 --> 06:04.843
And so what we did is we got a passkey and got into his room right in the morning before noon formation.

06:06.385 --> 06:09.951
No, it was before noon formation.

06:10.454 --> 06:17.885
And got in there and tied an inner tube to one of these pipes and then tied it to his doorknob.

06:18.385 --> 06:20.448
And it took three of us to get the door closed.

06:22.311 --> 06:27.238
And we're all standing on the wall at Chow, getting ready to fall out for Chow.

06:27.278 --> 06:32.045
And he comes in with an armload of books and sticks his key in the door and opens the doorknob.

06:32.065 --> 06:36.411
And it was almost like one of those cartoons where you see the person disappear and the books are still there.

06:37.910 --> 06:46.620
He grabbed that doorknob and just went into the room and his books just kind of fell to the floor right there.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.821
Did y'all get any punishment?

06:48.042 --> 06:49.163
No, because he didn't know who did it.

06:49.183 --> 06:55.250
And in those days, a sophomore had to know who the fish was.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.613
They couldn't punish the whole fish class.

06:57.633 --> 06:58.233
Junior could.

06:58.954 --> 07:03.259
Junior could take all of you and make you start doing push-ups until you confess, but a sophomore couldn't and so he

07:04.724 --> 07:08.931
Did you ever go to the quack shack?

07:08.952 --> 07:10.594
Did you get sick while you were in Aggie?

07:10.735 --> 07:11.256
Not a lot.

07:12.658 --> 07:16.004
You know, minor stuff.

07:19.210 --> 07:22.716
I think I was in there once, and that's when it used to be over near Cebiza.

07:24.198 --> 07:29.064
They used to have that old hospital over there, Nurse Ibiza, which God looked like something out of the Crimean War or something.

07:29.084 --> 07:29.925
They just leveled it.

07:30.386 --> 07:30.886
Oh, they did?

07:34.511 --> 07:36.994
MSC, did you get involved in MSC activities?

07:37.355 --> 07:42.080
My junior and senior years, I was in Town Hall.

07:43.602 --> 07:44.363
Got involved in that.

07:45.345 --> 07:48.188
Town Hall was where, you know, we'd bring guests to campus.

07:49.269 --> 07:52.193
Did you, were you a part of welcoming any important people?

07:52.213 --> 07:52.654
Brenda Lee.

07:53.154 --> 07:53.715
Hey.

07:54.202 --> 08:01.090
And... Oh, the singer.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.016
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

08:06.036 --> 08:07.818
I was thinking of his name the other day, and I can't remember it right now.

08:12.444 --> 08:13.605
I can see his face right now.

08:13.985 --> 08:14.486
I'll think about it.

08:14.606 --> 08:15.768
Brenda Lee was the big one.

08:15.788 --> 08:17.149
Brenda Lee was a real sweetheart.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.692
Just as sweet as she could be to us.

08:20.573 --> 08:22.015
And...

08:22.130 --> 08:26.716
She signed a whole bunch of photographs for all the—oh, Johnny Mathis was the other one.

08:26.736 --> 08:28.779
Johnny Mathis was the other one.

08:28.799 --> 08:34.166
But Brenda Lee was just as sweet as she could be, and I could be her escort when she was there, which was a real neat deal.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.088
Did you meet Wayne Stark?

08:37.410 --> 08:37.710
Yes.

08:37.951 --> 08:38.491
Yeah, sure did.

08:38.772 --> 08:39.633
Any impression of him?

08:40.955 --> 08:45.741
He had a different agenda than Earl Rudder did.

08:46.497 --> 08:53.675
He was much more of a liberal mind bent than other things, I think.

08:55.339 --> 08:56.963
You didn't have much direct

08:57.112 --> 08:58.554
No, not much direct.

09:00.117 --> 09:20.267
Because one of the things that, in hindsight, I think he did so, so well, he had an ability to spot a freshman or a sophomore of great potential and draw them out, and then he would get young faculty members and get them involved with these good students and so forth.

09:21.547 --> 09:23.249
Guyon Hall, you went to some movies there.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.470
Went to movies in Guyon Hall.

09:24.490 --> 09:26.613
And what, how did Aggies behave at Guyon Hall?

09:26.633 --> 09:35.583
Oh, just, you know, of course you'd go crazy if it was some girl in the scene or something like that or somebody would make some comment and you'd all yell, but that was about, you know, that was it.

09:35.824 --> 09:40.329
Or do you remember during your four years other celebrity visitors to the campus?

09:44.174 --> 09:45.475
Nothing really stands out.

09:45.675 --> 09:50.541
Politicians or performers?

09:52.040 --> 09:56.306
Of course, there were performers all the time at town hall and that sort of stuff.

09:56.326 --> 09:59.911
Of course, A&M was a pretty out of the way place in those days.

10:02.634 --> 10:06.860
All right, let's describe the student body in general during your four years.

10:08.042 --> 10:11.386
Their attitudes, their values, their geography.

10:12.788 --> 10:15.512
Well, A&M's always been a very conservative place.

10:15.532 --> 10:21.540
I mean, it's kind of the bastion of conservatism or what sure was then and probably still is fairly much now.

10:22.145 --> 10:34.023
You know, you had a mix, particularly early on there, you had a mix of either guys in the Corps or guys who had been in the Corps or guys who had been in the military.

10:35.244 --> 10:36.847
So it was a very conservative place.

10:39.691 --> 10:42.735
And, you know, everybody was pretty gung-ho and everything else.

10:43.196 --> 10:43.877
Urban?

10:44.077 --> 10:44.778
Urban?

10:44.798 --> 10:45.600
Well, mostly urban.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.681
Probably primarily urban.

10:46.701 --> 10:50.667
I mean, there were two uniforms on campus, either the Corps uniform or cowboy boots and blue jeans.

10:51.727 --> 10:56.174
And a lot of kids from rural environments.

10:58.778 --> 10:59.760
What about income level?

11:01.042 --> 11:02.143
Low, most.

11:02.784 --> 11:03.325
Did it matter?

11:03.746 --> 11:03.926
No.

11:05.729 --> 11:07.151
And that was probably a good thing about it.

11:07.532 --> 11:14.022
I mean, you know, you'd look at the cars out there, you know, that were parking on the campus, and there weren't,

11:15.993 --> 11:19.076
There weren't any BMWs, even if there had been BMWs at the time.

11:19.116 --> 11:20.357
There were none of that kind.

11:20.417 --> 11:22.239
Most everybody had Fords and Chevys.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.421
Occasionally folks had new ones.

11:25.022 --> 11:25.583
Most didn't.

11:26.243 --> 11:28.726
Did it matter what your national ancestry was?

11:28.746 --> 11:30.568
No, not at all.

11:31.128 --> 11:37.334
Did y'all have any nicknames during your era for national background?

11:40.337 --> 11:41.899
Not anything that...

11:44.495 --> 11:46.397
No, not anything I can remember.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.520
Like, do you know the Maltz brothers from Houston?

11:49.740 --> 11:50.100
No.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.241
They're a little older than you.

11:52.803 --> 11:53.804
Very active Jewish.

11:54.404 --> 11:56.827
And in their era, they were nicknamed Jew Boy.

11:57.988 --> 11:58.849
And I said, well, was that?

11:59.029 --> 12:00.170
No, that wasn't a put down.

12:00.490 --> 12:01.451
We were proud to be Jewish.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.532
Well, you know, and that's it.

12:02.572 --> 12:06.096
You know, you would occasionally hear maybe something like that, but it wasn't a put down.

12:06.116 --> 12:07.177
It was just like a tag.

12:08.258 --> 12:09.078
Yeah.

12:09.098 --> 12:11.160
It wasn't done in a derogatory manner.

12:11.441 --> 12:13.843
You know, even when we got some of the first blacks in the Corps,

12:14.330 --> 12:17.474
I remember a kid by the name of Michaud was in the outfit.

12:18.515 --> 12:19.416
Was he in your outfit?

12:20.157 --> 12:21.319
No, he wasn't in our outfit.

12:21.899 --> 12:23.081
God, what outfit was he in?

12:23.181 --> 12:29.209
But I really want to share anything you recall about blacks coming into the Corps when you were there.

12:30.510 --> 12:33.214
There was never anything overtly racist.

12:33.254 --> 12:41.524
I mean, there were comments wondering, I mean, everybody wondered, of course, if they could hack it, where they put in there for a reason, those kinds of things.

12:41.885 --> 12:43.847
But there was never anything...

12:44.468 --> 12:45.790
overtly racist.

12:46.831 --> 12:50.817
And the first, Michaud came in, and he was already a junior, I think.

12:50.897 --> 12:51.418
How do you spell it?

12:51.438 --> 12:51.799
Do you know?

12:53.101 --> 12:53.201
Yeah.

12:53.221 --> 12:53.621
God.

12:56.265 --> 12:57.808
M-A-C-H-E-A-U-X, I think.

12:58.088 --> 12:58.949
I think that's right.

12:58.969 --> 13:02.815
I think that's right.

13:03.436 --> 13:05.819
And he came and he was already an upperclassman when he came in.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.942
And so, let me grab that.

13:09.863 --> 13:13.868
We're talking about the student body and attitudes and so forth.

13:13.888 --> 13:19.594
At that point, while you were there, integration begins.

13:20.235 --> 13:28.144
What did you, in general, what did the NM student body think about the admission of black students?

13:32.545 --> 13:35.349
I'm trying to think in all.

13:35.369 --> 13:44.040
I don't know that there was a tremendous... I can remember my sophomore year, we had a black freshman in our outfit.

13:46.103 --> 13:49.067
And he was from Houston, and I used to ride down to Houston with him and his parents.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.491
How was he treated?

13:52.771 --> 13:54.033
He was treated like any other fish.

13:54.053 --> 14:00.882
There was never, ever, I never heard a racial slur

14:01.418 --> 14:08.106
I mean, some guys may have said it in private in the background or something like that, but there was never, ever anything said out in the open.

14:11.570 --> 14:18.457
And even like Michaud that we were talking about who came in as an upperclassman, anybody who came in as an upperclassman into the Corps, you know, was looked down on.

14:18.477 --> 14:21.621
You didn't go through the freshman year and you weren't squat.

14:22.322 --> 14:26.987
But there was never anything done against him.

14:27.558 --> 14:29.962
It was a non-event when blacks came in.

14:30.042 --> 14:31.985
It was a major thing when women came in.

14:32.285 --> 14:37.434
Yeah, now what did the average, what did y'all think about women coming in?

14:38.295 --> 14:49.212
You know, it, the core was the core and the school and everything else and all male and it was,

14:50.457 --> 14:52.500
I guess it was just the change in things.

14:52.961 --> 14:58.550
I do remember that those first couple of women on campus were extremely popular.

14:58.570 --> 15:00.494
Extremely popular.

15:00.514 --> 15:03.178
I mean, those young women must have thought they were in heaven.

15:03.859 --> 15:12.674
If there had been a secret ballot among all the undergraduates then, reckon what the vote would have been?

15:16.480 --> 15:17.241
I don't know of any...

15:18.757 --> 15:20.779
None of my friends were really against it.

15:21.580 --> 15:22.080
I don't know.

15:22.321 --> 15:23.161
Co-education, you mean?

15:23.242 --> 15:25.324
Against co-education.

15:26.205 --> 15:33.972
But the positive feeling would have been far more for integration, wouldn't it?

15:33.992 --> 15:35.734
That would have been an easier majority.

15:35.814 --> 15:38.257
Yeah, I think the majority of people were for integration.

15:38.317 --> 15:40.499
We saw the need for it and that sort of stuff.

15:40.639 --> 15:46.485
I mean, we felt that anybody who came in A&M should be qualified to come into A&M, but I don't

15:46.870 --> 15:48.352
I don't think there was a big negative thing.

15:48.692 --> 15:52.197
And I don't remember a lot of hard... In fact, it's kind of shocked me lately.

15:53.318 --> 15:58.305
I hear from some women who'd gone... In fact, we had a woman here who was class of 67.

15:58.445 --> 16:11.241
And she related a story to me about she was with her father and they met an ag and somehow the story came out

16:11.558 --> 16:17.525
You know, they had a child at A&M or something like that, and then he introduced her as his child at A&M, and this ag just turned around and walked away.

16:18.506 --> 16:24.293
You know, and so I guess some of the older guys really were adamantly, vehemently opposed to it.

16:24.473 --> 16:27.997
I don't know that any of my generation was that opposed to it.

16:29.399 --> 16:33.063
You know, I look at A&M today with the female population.

16:33.123 --> 16:36.166
Of course, walking across that campus is just incredible.

16:36.327 --> 16:40.131
My son, my oldest son, who was class of 99,

16:41.157 --> 16:50.288
call me when he was a fish, and he said, he said, Dad, I walked across campus today and I saw 40 gorgeous women, and they were different from the 40 gorgeous women I saw yesterday.

16:50.668 --> 16:53.612
He had a totally different experience at A&M than I did, let me tell you.

16:54.533 --> 17:01.101
When you all were there, was everybody accepted, and if so, why?

17:02.643 --> 17:03.504
Oh, yeah.

17:03.524 --> 17:03.784
I mean.

17:04.084 --> 17:07.208
Why did you accept all of these other?

17:07.428 --> 17:08.810
Because they were going through the same thing you were.

17:08.850 --> 17:10.472
It didn't make any difference.

17:10.655 --> 17:15.960
You know, particularly, you know, in the Corps, I mean, you didn't care.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.945
Anybody going through that experience, you were going through it together, and they were your buddies.

17:22.825 --> 17:24.727
Has that proved to be important to you?

17:25.428 --> 17:25.728
Yeah.

17:26.649 --> 17:27.089
Since then?

17:27.770 --> 17:30.292
Yeah, particularly the Corps experience.

17:31.793 --> 17:34.736
You know, I've still got buddies here in town that I'm in touch with.

17:34.776 --> 17:39.700
In fact, there was one in my office today who's a classmate of mine.

17:40.304 --> 17:42.868
You know, I mean, we're just, we're tight friends.

17:44.871 --> 17:59.595
But it's just generally being an Aggie, I can, you know, being in the Air Force and being all over the world, and you see somebody with an Aggie ring, and you just walk up and say, howdy, I'm Doug Fryder, class of 67, and I'm so-and-so class of so-and-so, and it doesn't make any difference.

18:00.638 --> 18:01.460
your Aggies.

18:02.582 --> 18:08.473
During that time you were on campus, did you participate in any religious activities?

18:08.633 --> 18:11.779
Yeah, I'm Catholic and I went to church at St.

18:11.819 --> 18:12.701
Mary's at Northgate.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.065
And were there a good number going?

18:15.466 --> 18:17.550
Oh yeah, I mean you couldn't, they had built

18:18.847 --> 18:20.529
We were still in the old church.

18:20.549 --> 18:28.877
The old church, which was on, that's University Boulevard, which was on University Boulevard at the time, and now I think there's a film station.

18:28.897 --> 18:29.878
Yeah, now it's a block back.

18:29.898 --> 18:30.859
And now it's a block back.

18:30.959 --> 18:38.486
They built the new church when I was there, but they had to build the new church because they had to hold so many masses in the old church.

18:39.207 --> 18:44.652
And I can still remember it would be standing room only in the new church on the weekends.

18:45.593 --> 18:55.154
And was there any religious group that was looked down upon?

18:55.214 --> 18:55.635
No, no.

18:56.918 --> 19:03.552
You know, and the thing about it, and I even talk to kids now when I'm recruiting for A&M, talk about the fact that religion is a very important part of the campus.

19:04.291 --> 19:17.980
and that, you know, that religious communities are an important part of the campus and participating in religion and it's surely not something that's frowned upon like it might be on some campuses.

19:18.060 --> 19:19.263
At A&M it's an integral part.

19:19.303 --> 19:23.211
Everybody comes from a pretty conservative God-fearing background

19:23.191 --> 19:29.728
And maybe that has a reason why that A&M has the lowest crime rate of any major university in the nation right now.

19:29.749 --> 19:30.290
That's right.

19:30.310 --> 19:31.413
That's right.

19:31.533 --> 19:33.097
We talked about football.

19:34.200 --> 19:34.902
What about Reveille?

19:34.922 --> 19:36.306
Was Reveille around much?

19:36.438 --> 19:40.965
Reveille was, yeah, and in fact, two of my classmates gave Reveille three, the Andes brothers.

19:41.946 --> 19:44.891
Steve and Randy Andes, our senior year.

19:45.712 --> 19:55.987
They were from Alaska, and their family got a collie and brought it down and became Reveille three, our senior year.

19:57.870 --> 20:00.534
What was it like to go to a basketball game in G. Raleigh?

20:00.554 --> 20:01.195
Oh, it was great.

20:01.315 --> 20:03.238
I remember Randy Madsen playing down there, and

20:03.674 --> 20:11.166
You know, with the band in there and echoing the sound and everything else, the basketball games were just awesome.

20:11.186 --> 20:12.188
If you could get away and get there.

20:13.270 --> 20:16.796
Yale leaders, did you all respect the Yale leaders?

20:16.996 --> 20:17.897
Oh, absolutely.

20:17.917 --> 20:24.428
And like I may have said earlier, Tommy Stone, who was in our outfit, was a junior and senior Yale leader.

20:24.949 --> 20:26.732
And he was head Yale leader senior year.

20:27.213 --> 20:27.353
Mm-hmm.

20:27.653 --> 20:33.299
And Tommy was just a hell of an individual, just awesome.

20:33.619 --> 20:35.701
Well, quite a few years ago, he passed away.

20:35.801 --> 20:39.005
But Tommy was Mr. A&M.

20:39.165 --> 20:50.056
He was from Donna, Texas, down in the valley, and was just an awesome leader, just incredible integrity, super guy, the epitome of what a yell leader ought to be.

20:51.357 --> 20:56.142
But yeah, and I'm so glad that A&M has kept the yell leaders like they are.

20:56.695 --> 21:04.447
Of all the student leadership positions, which one had the greatest prestige?

21:05.008 --> 21:08.474
If you could have held any student leadership position, which one would have been?

21:09.235 --> 21:10.597
Well, I guess there had been three.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.862
Corps commander, obviously.

21:14.864 --> 21:16.386
Head Yellier and commander of the RVs.

21:21.855 --> 21:23.918
I was not in the RVs because my

21:24.742 --> 21:27.926
There was just no way to work that in with engineering as far as I was concerned.

21:28.406 --> 21:29.908
I would have loved to have done that.

21:32.310 --> 21:36.215
Probably had Yell Eater would probably be the most prestigious.

21:36.235 --> 21:38.758
Did you all have a nickname for Yell Eaters?

21:38.778 --> 21:39.679
I've never heard of one.

21:39.819 --> 21:41.781
No, no, just Yell Eaters.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.564
I've never heard of one.

21:44.584 --> 21:49.990
And one of the questions I try to work in,

21:50.290 --> 21:51.832
Korean War is over, of course.

21:52.233 --> 21:53.615
Vietnam is not yet going.

21:54.536 --> 21:55.658
It's starting, yeah.

21:56.018 --> 22:03.008
But one of the pivotal events I'm assuming that you remember is the Kennedy assassination.

22:03.028 --> 22:04.971
I remember exactly what I was doing when I heard it.

22:04.991 --> 22:05.912
Please describe that.

22:06.633 --> 22:07.735
I was my freshman year.

22:08.836 --> 22:11.500
My birthday was November 21st.

22:12.902 --> 22:15.286
And so my birthday had been the day before.

22:15.306 --> 22:16.547
But I can remember walking.

22:16.928 --> 22:18.390
We were, it was,

22:19.197 --> 22:21.141
God, what was that, a Friday?

22:21.161 --> 22:24.968
It was bonfire time.

22:24.988 --> 22:34.626
And we had had Chow and Duncan, and I walked out of Duncan and was in the process of turning left to go to dorm 12.

22:35.387 --> 22:40.176
And I heard somebody yell out of dorm 10 that Kennedy had been shot.

22:41.557 --> 22:42.618
And that's where I heard about it.

22:42.838 --> 22:46.743
And then, of course, immediately went back to the dorm, and we turned on the radios.

22:47.564 --> 22:50.788
And I can remember all of us just kind of standing.

22:51.689 --> 23:01.320
We were kind of all standing in the hall with the radios blaring in the rooms and listening to it and just kind of in shocked disbelief.

23:05.244 --> 23:10.230
And that had to be one of the most depressing days of my life, that whole weekend.

23:10.497 --> 23:14.903
was just incredibly painful.

23:15.985 --> 23:21.974
And in our yearbook, there's a picture of the center pole, and that was our bonfire.

23:21.994 --> 23:27.341
We were the first class not to have a bonfire until my son's freshman year.

23:28.663 --> 23:30.706
My second son, who's class of 03.

23:31.668 --> 23:33.170
Yeah.

23:33.190 --> 23:36.615
Describe a bonfire for freshman year, freshman year.

23:37.476 --> 23:38.337
Oh, it was just awesome.

23:38.397 --> 23:39.559
What work did you do?

23:40.197 --> 23:42.560
Freshmen carried logs.

23:43.702 --> 23:44.683
Juniors and seniors cut.

23:44.783 --> 23:45.805
Freshmen and sophomores carried.

23:45.985 --> 23:48.208
About how far, where was the cutting area?

23:48.648 --> 23:49.189
What direction?

23:51.572 --> 23:52.353
I'm trying to remember.

23:53.695 --> 23:56.940
I was riding and not driving, so I don't know that I knew where the cutting area was.

23:57.400 --> 24:01.986
I'd just pile into a car at dark 30 in the morning, and we'd drive out to the cutting area.

24:02.006 --> 24:04.730
About how many days, weeks, did y'all work on it?

24:05.952 --> 24:08.415
You worked on and off.

24:10.960 --> 24:11.741
Let me see.

24:15.207 --> 24:21.036
We didn't start the cut as early as it had gotten by 99.

24:21.256 --> 24:24.821
I think it was mostly in November that we did the cut.

24:25.282 --> 24:28.427
And we took off from school and went out and did the cut.

24:29.188 --> 24:32.393
Were there any injuries of any importance that you remembered?

24:32.433 --> 24:32.694
No.

24:33.154 --> 24:38.082
There would be the scrapes and nicks and that sort of stuff, no injuries.

24:38.348 --> 24:43.395
And looking back in hindsight, was there any conduct that was inappropriate?

24:43.616 --> 24:43.796
No.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.061
No.

24:47.081 --> 24:55.072
You'd be out there and, you know, and it was all organized and, you know, we'd spend most of the day carrying logs, throwing them up on the trucks.

24:56.815 --> 24:59.579
Were you and your buddies aware of any secret fraternities?

25:00.079 --> 25:01.521
No.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.403
You're kidding.

25:02.423 --> 25:02.803
No.

25:02.823 --> 25:03.184
You didn't?

25:03.584 --> 25:05.147
I never knew of any secret fraternities.

25:05.748 --> 25:06.769
Which ones were there?

25:09.027 --> 25:10.930
You were involved with Town Hall.

25:10.990 --> 25:12.852
How did you get involved with Town Hall?

25:13.773 --> 25:22.145
Tommy Stone was a major mover in Town Hall at the beginning of our junior year, and he was able to get me in.

25:22.465 --> 25:23.586
Was that a good experience?

25:23.627 --> 25:24.267
Oh, sure was.

25:24.508 --> 25:24.848
Sure was.

25:24.908 --> 25:27.211
A really great deal.

25:27.632 --> 25:28.333
What about Skona?

25:28.673 --> 25:29.855
I was not in Skona.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.461
Is Skona still there?

25:34.913 --> 25:35.414
Barely.

25:35.534 --> 25:35.914
Barely?

25:35.934 --> 25:38.257
It was a mover and shaker at the time.

25:38.277 --> 25:39.098
They used to bring some.

25:39.418 --> 25:40.800
You're talking about bringing people to campus.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.263
Yeah, Scona would bring some.

25:43.483 --> 25:45.646
God, I'm trying to remember some of the people that Scona brought back.

25:45.666 --> 25:52.374
Like about the time that you were there, I remember Hubert Humphrey from Arizona.

25:54.477 --> 25:55.618
Go Water.

25:55.638 --> 25:56.980
I remember them both being there.

25:59.403 --> 26:00.704
Student indulgences.

26:02.166 --> 26:03.047
What did people drink?

26:03.618 --> 26:03.978
Beer.

26:04.619 --> 26:05.060
What kind?

26:05.941 --> 26:06.521
Lone Star.

26:07.903 --> 26:08.303
You know.

26:09.044 --> 26:10.746
And where'd they get it?

26:10.766 --> 26:11.948
Wherever you could, Whiskey Bridge.

26:12.909 --> 26:13.630
Yeah, that's right.

26:13.650 --> 26:15.151
Bradstead County was dry at the time.

26:15.171 --> 26:16.833
Yeah, I can remember driving over to Whiskey Bridge.

26:16.853 --> 26:20.137
And whoever had that piece of property, that must have been a gold mine.

26:20.758 --> 26:24.442
Because you drive across that bridge and there was the whiskey store there, the liquor store.

26:24.843 --> 26:29.608
As far as you recall, were the prices at Whiskey Bridge fair?

26:30.128 --> 26:31.590
Yeah, if I remember correctly.

26:31.670 --> 26:32.752
I don't think he gouged people.

26:32.772 --> 26:33.353
I don't think so.

26:33.453 --> 26:36.919
I mean, he had such a clientele there, you know.

26:37.519 --> 26:46.914
And did anybody that you knew of try to bring alcohol, either beer or stronger beverages, into the dorms?

26:49.137 --> 26:57.030
It was kind of frowned on, unlike today, which I hear they do it a lot today.

26:57.110 --> 26:57.891
But...

26:59.947 --> 27:05.252
It was not, I can't remember that much of alcohol on the dorms.

27:05.793 --> 27:08.456
What about going out to the clay pits?

27:08.856 --> 27:10.878
Oh yeah, going out to the clay pits and drinking out there.

27:11.058 --> 27:11.899
Where were they?

27:12.400 --> 27:13.921
Jesus, and again I cannot remember.

27:14.602 --> 27:20.068
Is it south and west down the Welburn Road and toward the river?

27:20.628 --> 27:24.452
I think it was, but again not having a car I rode along.

27:24.753 --> 27:26.817
And I cannot remember whether, I wish I could.

27:26.837 --> 27:28.180
I'm sorry I can't take it.

27:28.200 --> 27:32.108
And was it all male at the Clay Pits?

27:32.929 --> 27:34.513
I don't remember any girls there any time I went.

27:35.735 --> 27:38.380
And the skinny dipping?

27:38.401 --> 27:39.322
Never, I never did that.

27:39.603 --> 27:40.585
Never did any skinny dipping.

27:40.605 --> 27:44.112
How much whiskey did Aggies consume in that era?

27:46.707 --> 27:49.050
I can remember us drinking until we would buzz.

27:49.270 --> 27:54.035
I don't remember anybody getting, you know, stone-faced, crawling drunk.

27:54.836 --> 27:55.857
Although, here's another story.

27:59.041 --> 28:07.711
When we were sophomores, the rooms that you lived in over there were two rooms and then joined the bathroom in between in those new dorms.

28:07.731 --> 28:13.137
And I can remember one night about 2 o'clock in the morning, about 2 o'clock Sunday morning,

28:13.808 --> 28:20.678
I heard my roommate saying, no, no, his roommate across the hall saying, no, don't move it, don't move it, oh no.

28:20.898 --> 28:34.958
And I woke up and I look in the bathroom and here he is sitting on the floor with his legs around the commode and his arms around it with his head buried in it rocking back and forth saying, no, don't move it.

28:35.038 --> 28:37.281
But that was one of the few times I saw somebody that bad.

28:37.702 --> 28:40.285
Was Uncle Ed's gone by then, Hard Lickers?

28:40.886 --> 28:42.689
Yeah, I don't remember Uncle Ed's.

28:42.709 --> 28:43.630
What about tobacco?

28:44.572 --> 28:45.593
Did many people smoke?

28:45.813 --> 28:46.194
Yeah.

28:46.774 --> 28:47.655
And what did they smoke?

28:47.815 --> 28:49.377
Just, you know, just cigarettes.

28:49.577 --> 28:50.157
What brands?

28:51.178 --> 28:55.222
Camels and Lucky Strikes and that sort of stuff.

28:55.242 --> 28:56.724
Occasionally somebody would smoke a cigar.

28:57.845 --> 29:03.150
And, you know, every once in a while somebody would smoke a pipe if they wanted to seem sophisticated or something like that.

29:03.170 --> 29:04.952
Anybody chew tobacco?

29:04.972 --> 29:05.993
It wasn't as big a deal then.

29:06.774 --> 29:08.315
It wasn't as big a deal chewing tobacco.

29:08.575 --> 29:09.236
Nobody snuffed?

29:09.356 --> 29:09.837
Nobody snuffed.

29:09.877 --> 29:11.538
No, snuff was not a thing then.

29:11.558 --> 29:13.380
Did you all even know the word marijuana?

29:14.069 --> 29:16.593
We knew it existed.

29:17.334 --> 29:26.887
I can honestly, and I've told this to my kids and I don't think they believe me, but I cannot ever remember anybody using marijuana.

29:27.308 --> 29:28.069
Yeah, same here.

29:28.089 --> 29:28.970
It just didn't exist.

29:29.451 --> 29:31.233
It was not a thing at A&M.

29:31.814 --> 29:33.857
It was a communist thing and, you know.

29:34.438 --> 29:35.699
And you hadn't heard the word heroin.

29:35.960 --> 29:36.921
You know, hadn't heard heroin.

29:38.323 --> 29:41.207
Did anybody have any ingenious ways of,

29:41.440 --> 29:44.163
of hiding beer in their room that you heard of?

29:45.665 --> 29:46.226
Uh, no.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.368
Like I say, at that time we didn't have that much beer in the rooms.

29:48.789 --> 29:51.412
I mean, you know, I guess maybe it was because we were an engineering outfit again.

29:52.153 --> 30:01.164
We were pretty plain kind of guys, but, uh, shoot, no.

30:01.804 --> 30:07.431
Alright, you go to summer camp after your... Actually, I went after my

30:08.137 --> 30:08.958
Junior year?

30:08.978 --> 30:09.579
No, senior year.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.522
I actually went after my senior year.

30:13.084 --> 30:18.211
Because it ended up, I was going five years on taking aerospace engineering.

30:18.231 --> 30:20.994
So I ended up going after my senior year and went to Amarillo Air Force Base.

30:22.837 --> 30:25.000
How did an Aggie rate?

30:25.280 --> 30:27.843
Aggies did very well in summer camp.

30:28.284 --> 30:28.504
Why?

30:29.746 --> 30:31.248
Because it really wasn't any big deal.

30:31.789 --> 30:34.212
I mean, for a lot of the other students that were there,

30:35.187 --> 30:41.477
it was their first time to really be in that kind of a pressure environment and really there wasn't that much pressure.

30:41.917 --> 30:51.893
You know, and usually the Aggies, I can remember my roommates, you know, I was showing them how to make beds and how to do their underwear in a drawer and all that other kind of stuff and it wasn't a big deal.

30:53.135 --> 30:54.597
And it was kind of interesting

30:55.673 --> 31:01.279
You know, you learn, you got used to military custom and everything else.

31:01.299 --> 31:04.463
And I can remember being in the headquarters building at summer camp and walking out.

31:04.643 --> 31:08.007
And about the time I started to go out the door, they started playing retreat.

31:09.068 --> 31:12.392
And I walked out and stood at attention and saluted the flag.

31:13.473 --> 31:21.883
And then the commanding officer came out and congratulated me or thanked me for doing that.
