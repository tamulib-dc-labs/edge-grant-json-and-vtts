WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:03.939
He told you.

00:04.379 --> 00:06.221
He said, of course, we can't give you any more money.

00:06.241 --> 00:07.822
I just stood up.

00:08.003 --> 00:13.668
I'm not going to say what I said, but I said, I'm not going to coach the women for nothing.

00:13.748 --> 00:23.678
I walked out and slammed the door, went down to the office at the stadium, and I figured that when I got down there, the phone would ring, and Charlie Thomas, you're fired.

00:24.158 --> 00:27.722
I mean, I just knew that was it, but I wasn't going to coach the women for free.

00:28.923 --> 00:33.227
I mean, that guy was getting like $40,000, $50,000 a year to coach him, you know.

00:33.207 --> 00:39.580
And another thing he said, he said, well, also we've got to take three of the women's scholarships and give them to tennis or golf.

00:40.462 --> 00:46.073
So in other words, I've got to coach women with no money and take some of their scholarships away and then try to beat Texas.

00:46.173 --> 00:47.576
See, that's all in my mind.

00:47.596 --> 00:50.442
I've got to try to beat Texas, and Texas was dominating women's sports.

00:50.522 --> 00:52.887
I mean, they were, you know.

00:52.867 --> 01:00.785
But anyway, the phone rings later on, and John Davis said, Charlie, come back up to the office in the morning and said, I think I got something worked out.

01:00.805 --> 01:05.656
I'll go back up there, and he said, I'm going to give you a $1,500 raise and give a $10,000 raise.

01:05.676 --> 01:06.518
Y'all coach with me.

01:06.659 --> 01:08.503
He said, would you be interested in that?

01:08.523 --> 01:10.808
I said, yeah, I'll do that.

01:10.788 --> 01:15.836
But anyway, they eliminate that coach, eliminate three scholarships.

01:15.856 --> 01:20.943
But see, I didn't really know it, but they were still having money problems then, too.

01:20.983 --> 01:30.117
And I didn't realize that because all I, you know, I think I've got to win and do as good as I can, you know.

01:30.658 --> 01:35.805
What was the difference between coaching men and coaching women?

01:35.825 --> 01:36.306
How did they compare it?

01:36.573 --> 01:43.543
Well, I found that you had to work the women a little bit harder, and that surprised me.

01:44.244 --> 01:47.829
But you had to work them a little bit harder to get the same results.

01:47.849 --> 01:54.058
And I went and talked to several coaches and other places that coached men and women and had been doing it.

01:55.359 --> 01:57.282
He said, a woman

01:58.291 --> 02:06.464
He said, like if you're running, you're training your quarter-model to run six 220s and real fast, a little rest.

02:06.504 --> 02:10.831
He said, you need to run the women about 10 to 12 220s slower.

02:10.932 --> 02:18.003
He said, it just takes more running for them to get in shape, to do their best.

02:18.023 --> 02:21.649
They have to work out a little bit harder, and that was about the only difference.

02:22.996 --> 02:30.524
Was there any coaching practice that you had used over the years for women, for men, that you realized wouldn't work for women?

02:30.544 --> 02:32.652
Well, that was,

02:32.868 --> 02:58.581
the main thing, and they had several women that was kind of the club-footed type deal, and I was trying to teach them how to form, how to run correctly, and boy, right quick, they told me that they were, I had a bad hip, I had this or that, and I mean, they'd jump right back on you and tell you, you can't tell me to do that, you know, so I'd just kind of forget about it and just let them run.

02:58.601 --> 03:02.065
If they want to run backwards, let them run backwards.

03:02.045 --> 03:11.563
But most of the girls, I found that one thing, they're dedicated, and they work harder, and the women are really dedicated.

03:12.064 --> 03:23.445
See, I had the first girl to win the NCAA championship in the high jump, and I think it's the first woman that won the first place was a track girl.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.520
All right, back to your own guidelines.

03:26.781 --> 03:29.964
You weren't a smoker, is that right?

03:30.044 --> 03:31.786
Right, uh-huh.

03:31.806 --> 03:33.849
Do you have any personal guidelines about drinking?

03:35.410 --> 03:43.119
The whole time I drank, I drank a cocktail or something, but around the house I never had beer or anything.

03:43.420 --> 03:51.308
When you were trying to get the track team straightened out, did you ever get loud?

03:51.328 --> 03:52.690
Did you ever raise your voice?

03:52.923 --> 03:54.845
Not very often, huh?

03:54.865 --> 04:06.300
The first thing that I had a problem with when I came to Texas A&M, the military, the guy, everybody was in the Corps, see, and start to go to work out down there.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.304
Wouldn't anybody show up for a workout or just a few start working out.

04:10.385 --> 04:14.830
So I finally had a meeting and put a rule in there.

04:14.810 --> 04:20.781
You know, and then some of the main runners, they were COs or whatever of the company, you know.

04:20.801 --> 04:21.382
Coach, I can't.

04:21.402 --> 04:22.103
I'm a CO.

04:22.163 --> 04:23.846
I got to do this and I got to do this.

04:23.866 --> 04:28.995
I said, all right, if you're going to do that, I don't want you on a track team.

04:29.015 --> 04:32.281
And I set a roof where they had to be in practice every day.

04:32.321 --> 04:36.649
And see, they were all within a dormitory.

04:37.388 --> 04:38.710
but they were wearing the uniform.

04:38.850 --> 04:46.820
So I got it fixed where I could, if I kicked them out, I could kick them out, but they'd have to move into the Corps.

04:46.840 --> 04:52.988
And I did, I kicked several of them out and made them move into the Corps because they were just, they weren't very good athletes.

04:53.008 --> 04:55.472
They were just all, that's all they wanted to do.

04:55.492 --> 04:58.055
And they were just kind of coming out for track.

04:58.135 --> 05:00.779
But I finally got them all working out.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.725
Now did you tell, over the years, did you tell the members of the track team

05:06.042 --> 05:15.310
what any rules that you wanted them to follow about dormitory, about drinking and this and that and the other,

05:17.332 --> 05:21.957
Just not do anything bad.

05:22.078 --> 05:24.521
I mean, don't tear up the dorm or anything like that.

05:24.621 --> 05:26.803
We never did have any problem.

05:26.943 --> 05:29.286
One time over at Cane Hall, they flooded that thing.

05:29.506 --> 05:31.889
But that's all sports was in that, you know.

05:32.630 --> 05:33.691
They flooded that thing.

05:33.751 --> 05:39.939
I went up there that morning and water was that deep in Cane, in Hart Hall.

05:41.100 --> 05:45.145
And they moved all the furniture, were wet, and they moved it out.

05:45.344 --> 05:48.249
Yeah, you said Kane Hall started with, you meant Hart.

05:48.310 --> 05:49.131
Hart Hall, yeah.

05:49.933 --> 05:57.987
And anyway, for a whole week, I don't know who the athletic director was in, maybe Fulberg.

06:00.011 --> 06:00.973
Yeah, they've been about right.

06:01.493 --> 06:14.238
But anyway, they made those guys meet and run like three miles every morning for about a month and come back and mop everybody.

06:14.539 --> 06:17.064
We had to quit having track practice for two or three days.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.110
Everybody had to clean up the dorm, mop it.

06:20.090 --> 06:26.481
They stopped up all the commodes and turned them on up on the top floor or something.

06:26.561 --> 06:28.624
All that water run down and couldn't get out.

06:29.045 --> 06:33.091
It was kind of funny, but it was a bad deal, you know.

06:34.053 --> 06:34.333
All right.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.816
Now, you got here in 1957?

06:36.056 --> 06:36.257
Uh-huh.

06:37.899 --> 06:42.587
And at that point, where was A&M in the conference?

06:43.732 --> 06:47.055
They were the top of the conference.

06:47.996 --> 06:53.782
My senior year at Texas in 1954, we won the Southwest Conference.

06:53.802 --> 06:54.703
We beat A&M.

06:54.863 --> 07:00.829
A&M had won it the three years that I was at Texas before that.

07:01.049 --> 07:02.911
I knew how good A&M was.

07:03.451 --> 07:06.054
They had all those good field event guys.

07:06.114 --> 07:08.216
They had Walt Davis in the high jump.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.401
How did A&M do your first years?

07:13.769 --> 07:21.643
We were second, third, and about the same as Colonel Andy Adams.

07:21.663 --> 07:27.633
Have you tallied up all of those in all the years that you were the head coach?

07:27.653 --> 07:28.335
How did we do?

07:29.757 --> 07:33.404
Well, I think we won.

07:34.826 --> 07:37.110
We did better in the Nationals.

07:37.377 --> 07:47.783
ranked than we did the Southwest Conference because you couldn't hardly win the Southwest Conference, but you could go beat everybody else in the nationals.

07:47.803 --> 07:53.698
I think I only won four Southwest Conference championships in those years, but I was in the top four

07:53.678 --> 07:57.124
of the NCAA, which no other sport has done.

07:57.144 --> 08:01.492
I don't think football has ever ranked in the top four or basketball.

08:02.674 --> 08:11.329
We got second one time, and we've got in the top six, I think, about six times or something like that.

08:12.611 --> 08:18.201
And do you have any idea how many NCAA individual champions you have?

08:19.649 --> 08:29.003
No, but I've had, I think a little over a hundred All-Americans.

08:29.363 --> 08:30.305
Something like that.

08:30.325 --> 08:36.013
That list you showed me there of record holders.

08:36.033 --> 08:43.204
Let's see, I made a list here.

08:43.224 --> 08:44.466
I might leave this with you.

08:44.526 --> 08:48.171
I'd write down things for a long time in case

08:49.619 --> 08:53.385
All right, here's my world record holder.

08:53.405 --> 09:02.959
Everybody on that list is, not just the NCAA, but world record.

09:02.979 --> 09:11.092
Of all of those, we mentioned Matson and Ted Nelson.

09:11.212 --> 09:18.563
Who else, as you think back, who are some of your other favorites?

09:18.762 --> 09:23.771
Okay, Arturo Barris, he held two world records.

09:23.791 --> 09:26.255
I just got one down here because one of them has been broken.

09:29.881 --> 09:37.374
Right now he holds a world record in 20,000 meters, and he did hold a world record in 10,000 meters.

09:37.394 --> 09:39.918
That's been broken, but he still holds a world record.

09:40.319 --> 09:42.643
He's one of my stars.

09:42.623 --> 09:48.031
For instance, Arkansas, this is when Arkansas started taking over and winning everything.

09:48.692 --> 09:55.522
When Artira came along, we had the other Southwest Conference meet in Arkansas.

09:56.944 --> 10:02.472
We'd take Artira up there and he went to 5,000 and 10,000 on their track.

10:03.294 --> 10:04.535
You talk about being shocked.

10:04.656 --> 10:09.002
Arkansas, they dominate all those distance events.

10:08.982 --> 10:11.945
But he's one of the great runners we've had.

10:12.886 --> 10:20.955
Andre Kaysen, a little sprinter, he set the world record in a six-yard dash indoors.

10:20.975 --> 10:24.058
It's not just a state record, but it's a world record.

10:24.078 --> 10:26.020
I mean, the best there is, you know.

10:29.203 --> 10:31.165
Right now, he's on the world record.

10:31.205 --> 10:32.847
He still holds the world record.

10:32.827 --> 10:34.110
on the relay team.

10:34.130 --> 10:41.807
He ran with a bunch out of the Houston USA team in 1993, and Floyd Heard was just like him.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.419
He's on the world record in the 880 relay right now.

10:47.940 --> 10:52.590
But anyway, Floyd Heard was a guy from Milwaukee that I recruited.

10:52.570 --> 10:57.775
He ran 1995 in a 220.

10:57.875 --> 11:02.380
You know, he was a great guy.

11:04.061 --> 11:07.225
But both of those guys I had to recruit hard to get out of.

11:08.966 --> 11:09.927
He was from Milwaukee.

11:10.147 --> 11:20.738
Andre Cason was from out of pretty close to, I forget what state he was from, but up there around Washington, D.C.

11:22.085 --> 11:22.826
Oh, yeah.

11:22.846 --> 11:32.236
Another deal is the vice president of the governor of Texas, he ran track for me.

11:33.597 --> 11:34.418
Oh, Rick Perry.

11:35.139 --> 11:35.279
Uh-huh.

11:35.299 --> 11:36.020
Did he?

11:36.040 --> 11:36.180
Uh-huh.

11:36.200 --> 11:36.981
What was his event?

11:37.001 --> 11:39.704
Well, he was a walk-on type guy.

11:39.844 --> 11:40.624
What was his?

11:40.685 --> 11:41.746
He was a quarter miler.

11:42.366 --> 11:42.767
Okay.

11:42.787 --> 11:43.427
Ran some.

11:43.528 --> 11:48.733
And anyway, what I was going to say, though, all the

11:50.148 --> 11:57.418
Well, the guy in Congress up there that's Aggie talked here.

11:57.859 --> 11:59.501
Oh, Phil Graham?

11:59.521 --> 12:00.082
Phil Graham.

12:00.843 --> 12:01.544
All right.

12:01.564 --> 12:06.932
I recruited a quarter mile from Maryland that was state champion, great guy, black guy.

12:07.492 --> 12:12.139
And he invited the whole family to the White House.

12:12.119 --> 12:14.923
and entertained them at the White House.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.265
And that sold them.

12:16.285 --> 12:19.269
And when I got him back down here, I signed him.

12:19.289 --> 12:22.073
And he ran for us and did great.

12:22.494 --> 12:30.445
And I can't even think of his name, but he was the first black to graduate in the School of Engineering at Texas A&M, another track guy.

12:31.246 --> 12:34.971
I had a bunch of blacks be the first graduate in different deals.

12:36.875 --> 12:48.644
But anyway, then I had Randy Barnes, Randy Mattson, Mike Stutes, and those three, they were three 70 foot shot footers, all of them Olympic champions and so forth.

12:48.664 --> 12:52.133
And then I had Curtis Mills,

12:53.547 --> 12:56.451
And he, you know, he was the world's best.

12:57.052 --> 13:01.177
And then the next year, recruited his brother, who was Marvin Mills.

13:01.237 --> 13:11.330
And with those two, put together with Rocky Woods and Donnie Rogers, they were two white guys.

13:11.350 --> 13:16.116
For two years, we were undefeated in the relay with those four runners.

13:16.136 --> 13:19.200
And Rocky Woods was,

13:21.155 --> 13:25.061
You know, he won the 220.

13:25.101 --> 13:27.085
He beat Marvin Mills.

13:27.726 --> 13:29.849
I mean, he was fast.

13:29.969 --> 13:33.475
But anyway, we were undefeated there.

13:34.256 --> 13:35.218
We made some big time.

13:35.258 --> 13:37.742
We went to indoor New York City.

13:37.762 --> 13:39.565
They had those big indoor meets up there.

13:39.585 --> 13:41.728
We made several of those trips.

13:43.732 --> 13:46.977
Got a lot of experience, a lot of publicity out of them, you know.

13:47.851 --> 13:54.660
Now, did you have a team that you enjoyed beating more than anybody else?

13:54.700 --> 13:55.300
Texas.

13:57.183 --> 13:57.543
Always.

13:58.144 --> 14:02.149
What were the relations like between you and the Texas coaches?

14:02.449 --> 14:03.391
We were real friendly.

14:03.411 --> 14:04.372
We still are.

14:07.075 --> 14:09.158
In fact, I went to Austin last week.

14:09.178 --> 14:12.662
I was invited up there for the Texas relays.

14:12.742 --> 14:15.546
They named the street Clyde Littlefield deal.

14:15.526 --> 14:22.253
And Clyde Littlefield and Frank Anderson were big buddies, and they were battling each other every week.

14:23.274 --> 14:25.516
And it's about the same way right now.

14:25.556 --> 14:29.821
Ted Nelson and Bubba Thornton, Bubba coach at TCU.

14:30.261 --> 14:32.504
And Bubba and I, we're just like it.

14:32.584 --> 14:40.812
I mean, we battle each other, but we'll go out and drink coffee together and, you know, sit down and eat dinner together and stuff like that, you know.

14:41.533 --> 14:45.297
We're all good friends, and we just try to beat each other.

14:46.492 --> 14:57.150
During your years of coaching in the Southwest Conference, did most of the other schools follow the NCAA regulations well?

14:57.410 --> 14:58.212
Yes, uh-huh.

15:01.117 --> 15:01.618
Let's see.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.863
Well, they were more near SMU.

15:05.244 --> 15:07.808
They got in trouble, you know.

15:11.433 --> 15:19.941
for most of those years, it was A&M, Texas, Rice at first.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.423
Yes, uh-huh.

15:21.443 --> 15:22.864
And then later Baylor.

15:23.705 --> 15:24.646
Baylor, uh-huh.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.307
Came along.

15:25.627 --> 15:28.089
Jack Patterson.

15:28.169 --> 15:28.310
Yeah.

15:28.390 --> 15:29.311
Got Baylor going.

15:29.451 --> 15:32.814
And then Arkansas not long before they left the conference.

15:32.894 --> 15:34.696
Right, uh-huh.

15:34.716 --> 15:39.921
Academically, what were some of the toughest courses that,

15:40.660 --> 15:44.728
that track athletes had to take at A&M?

15:44.748 --> 15:46.311
What were they?

15:46.331 --> 15:48.154
It was, well, English.

15:48.796 --> 15:52.823
English and, I think, chemistry.

15:53.224 --> 15:54.286
English and chemistry.

15:54.847 --> 15:56.931
Was there a favorite major for them?

15:58.345 --> 16:26.698
Well, it ended up, seemed like physical education, but I think it's because they wanted to be coaches, you know, teachers, and it's because they were good, and if they were real good track, well, a lot of times they wanted to end up going back in coaching, but a lot of them take business, and I had another first guy, the first class that graduated in

16:27.556 --> 16:38.950
dentistry was Steve O'Neill, and he was a track guy, but he also holds a professional kicking football.

16:39.391 --> 16:52.768
He was a track recruit, and they get him out for football, and he ends up kicking for them, you know, and then he goes in the pros and kicks a 98-yard punt, and he's a dentist here in town right now.

16:53.329 --> 16:55.251
But he graduated out of first class,

16:55.805 --> 16:57.889
and he was on the track scholarship.

17:01.295 --> 17:07.786
Who gave the track, members of the track team, who gave them academic advice?

17:08.427 --> 17:08.948
Who did they try?

17:09.329 --> 17:13.717
Well, we had an academic counselor, Buddy Denton.

17:14.899 --> 17:15.019
Buddy?

17:15.039 --> 17:17.243
He was the first one and the only one for a long time.

17:17.283 --> 17:18.505
How well did Buddy do that?

17:19.075 --> 17:20.617
Well, it kept him busy.

17:20.978 --> 17:33.254
I mean, see, the deal was, and it kind of still is, when they hired the athletic counselor or whatever, what's his title?

17:33.615 --> 17:34.536
Counselor?

17:34.556 --> 17:35.437
Athletic counselor?

17:36.559 --> 17:46.151
His main duty is to keep all football players eligible and then maybe basketball and maybe, you know, track.

17:46.172 --> 17:47.293
So my deal was,

17:48.539 --> 17:51.544
I'm the one that has to go see the teachers, you know.

17:51.564 --> 17:54.229
I play Buddy Denton because he's so busy.

17:54.269 --> 18:02.042
I mean, how can you keep 60 football players eligible, and then you got 10 or 12 track guys you want to check on?

18:02.483 --> 18:05.108
So I end up going talking to the teachers.

18:06.229 --> 18:11.779
In fact, the year that, oh, the

18:12.788 --> 18:21.087
Black football player, won NCAA three times in a 60-yard dash.

18:21.107 --> 18:21.989
From here, Brian.

18:22.290 --> 18:22.992
Curtis Dickey.

18:23.012 --> 18:24.255
Curtis Dickey.

18:24.495 --> 18:27.803
Curtis Dickey flunked it out.

18:27.823 --> 18:29.667
And the white quarterback.

18:31.385 --> 18:32.466
See, he was a track guy.

18:32.666 --> 18:33.407
He flunks out.

18:34.688 --> 18:37.331
Football is over, so they don't care.

18:38.612 --> 18:39.073
All right.

18:39.593 --> 18:43.878
Neither one of them can run track because they didn't pass enough hours.

18:44.919 --> 18:52.106
So I go and talk to both teachers and ask them would they, I didn't try to get them to change the grade.

18:53.087 --> 18:55.570
You know, all they needed was a D.

18:55.550 --> 19:15.691
I asked them, I said, would you give them a test over, let them study, and I explained, they'd miss a lot, athletics and stuff, and let them study and take the test in two weeks, and then if they can pass the test and rate it to a D, I said they'd be eligible, and they both agreed.

19:15.731 --> 19:21.557
So I got Curtis Dickey, a great quarterback, he played pro football.

19:21.537 --> 19:22.819
He was tough.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.603
He was champion in a hurdle, high hurdle.

19:25.863 --> 19:26.805
Not Bucky Richards.

19:26.825 --> 19:28.968
No, he was some humble, humble.

19:31.011 --> 19:33.715
But he was like a nine-five sprinter.

19:33.755 --> 19:42.287
But anyway, I got those two guys eligible because Buddy Denton, or it wasn't Buddy, it was that new guy that got over there now, a blue.

19:42.327 --> 19:43.208
It might have been Buddy.

19:43.248 --> 19:43.990
He was who it was.

19:44.050 --> 19:48.216
He just didn't have time to, you know, that wasn't illegal.

19:48.236 --> 19:51.240
I mean, you know, everybody did stuff like that.

19:51.963 --> 19:57.676
Were there some faculty members that were particularly helpful to you?

19:58.758 --> 19:59.319
Not really.

20:00.662 --> 20:03.188
Because we didn't have any choice of putting them in any

20:04.754 --> 20:07.117
Now, I did have some that hit me.

20:08.038 --> 20:09.740
I had two during the time.

20:10.421 --> 20:12.124
One guy hit me, coached a long jump.

20:13.465 --> 20:20.735
He was a long jumper from North Texas, and he was in the School of Business.

20:20.935 --> 20:21.856
This was way back there.

20:22.077 --> 20:30.688
For three or four years, he hit me, and I finally got a little money to pay him a little bit to be my sister.

20:30.708 --> 20:34.693
He coached a long jump and several things like that.

20:35.737 --> 20:38.441
but mainly it was just me and Ted.

20:39.343 --> 20:46.815
All right, and in facilities, when did they describe over those 30 years how the facilities were changing?

20:46.855 --> 20:48.899
Just gradually getting better.

20:49.580 --> 21:01.980
We started buying hurdles real quick and buying new hurdles, and we got caught and then we'd buy pole vault pits and high jump pits.

21:03.226 --> 21:11.435
Now during, was the track, the track facility remained inside Kyle Field during all of your years, didn't it?

21:11.455 --> 21:11.896
Yes, uh-huh.

21:12.577 --> 21:17.903
Well, I moved my last year to, I was in the new stadium.

21:18.323 --> 21:20.666
In fact, they got me to be the starter.

21:20.906 --> 21:26.513
I shot the first, I started the first race in the track meet in the new stadium.

21:26.853 --> 21:30.297
Where did the funding come from for that stadium?

21:30.938 --> 21:32.119
Well, the guy from,

21:33.736 --> 21:37.441
What's the guy donating money for the baseball park?

21:38.503 --> 21:38.804
Olson.

21:39.024 --> 21:40.186
Olson gave $100,000.

21:42.068 --> 21:49.900
He gave $100,000, and the deal was, he and Frank Anderson were friends.

21:50.701 --> 21:56.330
He gave him $100,000, and to name it Frank Anderson.

21:56.350 --> 21:58.332
Did you get to help with the planning of it?

21:59.514 --> 22:01.397
Yeah, we designed the track for it.

22:01.968 --> 22:04.131
How do you feel about the quality of it?

22:04.152 --> 22:07.397
I think it's one of the best, or the best.

22:08.559 --> 22:15.450
Texas just built a new track, a new stadium, and their track is about like ours.

22:15.590 --> 22:16.952
Now, our stadium is sorry.

22:17.293 --> 22:21.580
I mean, you know, if we had to have the NCAA track meet, we couldn't have it.

22:21.780 --> 22:26.828
I mean, you know, it's just a little old cheap stadium.

22:26.808 --> 22:33.058
We got about five different runaways or six for the pole vault.

22:33.078 --> 22:39.127
I don't care which way the wind is blowing, we can have it pole vault with the wind.

22:39.147 --> 22:43.534
Do you guys wish that the tracks could have been left with inside the stadiums?

22:43.514 --> 22:50.685
Well, we did to start with, but once we got moved over here, we loved it.

22:51.847 --> 22:57.095
The bad part of it, the stadium wasn't big enough to block off the wind, and we got more wind.

22:57.535 --> 23:00.400
But we loved being over here out of the way of football.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.144
I mean, we always had conflict with football.

23:03.504 --> 23:06.048
You know, every day it was something.

23:06.068 --> 23:07.731
It was a whole lot better.

23:07.791 --> 23:09.133
Texas coaches,

23:09.113 --> 23:10.276
They were the same way.

23:10.316 --> 23:12.160
They hated to move out of that stadium.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.284
Man, I mean, they thought that was terrible.

23:15.146 --> 23:21.220
But they built this new track over there, and now they said, man, this is the greatest thing ever happened to Texas.

23:22.943 --> 23:27.814
What caused you to feel good and proud about being the coach?

23:28.199 --> 23:29.743
track coach at Texas A&M?

23:30.124 --> 23:43.221
Well, number one, it was in the Southwest Conference, or number one, Texas A&M was noted for the academic for being big time,

23:43.201 --> 23:47.045
academic and a great institution, you know.

23:47.746 --> 23:50.950
I knew it would be easy to go offer a guy a scholarship.

23:50.970 --> 23:58.419
I mean, they'd rather go to Texas A&M than go to Sam Houston or go anywhere else really, you know.

23:59.039 --> 24:03.084
And that was a big, it was big.

24:05.046 --> 24:09.291
And did that, that Aggie pride, was that an important thing?

24:09.472 --> 24:11.554
Oh yes, that was great.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.369
I realized that.

24:13.509 --> 24:21.111
I hadn't been here but one week, and I realized that the Aggie spirit was better than the Texas spirit.

24:21.592 --> 24:27.349
Over there, you think everything is great, and it is.

24:28.358 --> 24:30.885
You know, they just, they're sort of like the Aggies.

24:31.025 --> 24:39.868
I know one time when I was at school over there, they come running in the dormitory, hollering and screaming at night, said the Aggies, the Aggies are on the track, let's just go.

24:39.948 --> 24:44.460
So everybody, all the athletes gathered up and they run over there, they're gonna fight.

24:44.440 --> 24:48.565
They're going to kill any Aggie that was in the stadium.

24:49.526 --> 24:54.953
Anyway, they painted Texas A&M on the grass or something, some little deals like that.

24:54.973 --> 25:00.059
They used to have little conflicts like that, but it was just spirit type deals.

25:00.900 --> 25:05.225
During your years, did both schools benefit by this friendly rivalry?

25:06.286 --> 25:07.228
Yes, I think so.

25:07.468 --> 25:07.868
Each one better.

25:08.689 --> 25:11.713
I think so.

25:12.014 --> 25:23.653
It was better to run, like if I was at Texas, it was better to run Texas A&M than it would be to go to Baylor or go to University of Houston.

25:24.435 --> 25:27.720
It was just more competition was better.

25:30.164 --> 25:34.191
What were, of all those years, the proudest moments for you?

25:34.390 --> 25:44.303
Well, the main thing is either finding a great athlete or having a good athlete to come through and do well.

25:44.503 --> 26:03.148
I've had some bad moments, like I've found some great guys that turned out that didn't do any good, and one of them was the hardest guy I ever recruited, and he was a great guy, a nice guy from over here.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.571
I'm getting where I can't remember a thing.

26:07.591 --> 26:13.479
Little town's about a two-hour drive from here, South Texas, but he was the number one sprinter.

26:13.759 --> 26:26.136
And A&M sent him to, we had an Aggie that flew him up to Los Angeles to the high school national meet, and he'd get like second or third in the national meet in the 102-20.

26:26.617 --> 26:29.541
He was world caliber.

26:29.521 --> 26:33.368
Or he comes to A&M, and I recruit him in Broadhead.

26:33.428 --> 26:36.713
That's the guy out of Louisiana that I talk about at the same time.

26:36.793 --> 26:40.480
I had two of the best track men in the United States sign.

26:42.243 --> 26:44.847
What was his name?

26:46.666 --> 26:56.236
Anyway, he pulled a muscle his freshman year, and he'd just run off and on, and he'd work hard.

26:56.256 --> 27:02.363
I mean, he would run 100, repeat 220 or anything, double what he was supposed to do.

27:03.584 --> 27:04.725
He could never sprint.

27:04.745 --> 27:10.311
I mean, he would run beautiful, but he wasn't running very fast.

27:10.291 --> 27:12.775
He never, never come around.

27:13.035 --> 27:17.842
He did run on a relay team once or twice in four years, but he graduated and he's a big Aggie.

27:17.883 --> 27:21.067
But, I mean, that's one of my disappointments.

27:21.668 --> 27:27.217
It's like finding an All-American tackle and you don't play a game in four years, you know.

27:32.325 --> 27:33.546
Now, I'm just about finished.

27:33.626 --> 27:35.329
What have we not covered that we should have?

27:36.230 --> 27:39.235
I think we've just about covered everything.

27:39.653 --> 27:46.099
To whom do you feel most grateful for the satisfaction of all those years?

27:46.119 --> 27:50.764
If everybody from all those years could be brought in, who would you want to?

27:50.784 --> 27:55.548
Well, I guess I'd say Ted Nelson.

27:55.568 --> 28:04.277
And he's helped me out more than anybody and any one single person.

28:04.297 --> 28:06.859
Of all the athletic directors, who was the most grateful?

28:07.548 --> 28:10.091
They were all real good.

28:10.191 --> 28:14.155
The very first one was great.

28:15.016 --> 28:24.265
And Amber Ballard and Jackie Sherrill and Gene Stallings, they were all great.

28:24.906 --> 28:32.914
They were all dedicated and almost all of them had the same type of rules and everything, you know.

28:33.839 --> 28:37.124
You mentioned President Rudder and Williams.

28:37.184 --> 28:41.290
Were there other presidents that were obvious?

28:41.430 --> 28:42.231
Well, I never did.

28:42.632 --> 28:48.280
I didn't get acquainted with them very much.

28:50.082 --> 28:50.984
All right.

28:52.045 --> 28:54.028
Then I've only got one or two questions left.

28:54.168 --> 29:02.260
One of them is, if somebody walked up to you and handed you a million-dollar check with one requirement,

29:02.780 --> 29:14.180
that you had to pass that on to Texas A&M, but you could decide what the money would be used for, what would you have that, have A&M do with that?

29:14.200 --> 29:17.125
If you could make a million dollar gift to A&M, what would it be?

29:17.145 --> 29:25.159
Well, for a million dollars, I'd have a new stadium built on the other side of what they got now.

29:26.017 --> 29:29.335
you could build a real great stadium, I think.

29:29.757 --> 29:33.900
Is there anybody that has a stadium that you'd use as a model?

29:34.927 --> 29:42.235
Well, the new one that they built in Texas, it'll hold 20,000, 10,000 on each side.

29:43.056 --> 29:46.180
But their situation's a little bit different than ours.

29:46.200 --> 29:52.307
See, they hold the state meets over there, so they're going to have bigger crowds and more of them.

29:52.327 --> 29:56.952
And now that they put on the Texas Relay, they need a little bit bigger stadium.

29:56.932 --> 29:59.555
We need one a little bit bigger than ours.

30:00.897 --> 30:05.523
It just needs to be a little bit better, I think.

30:05.543 --> 30:06.765
But they're getting the scoreboard.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.627
They're getting the things now.

30:08.687 --> 30:11.491
They got a brand new scoreboard.

30:12.092 --> 30:13.694
It's world class now.

30:13.714 --> 30:19.121
At the end, you keep 10 scores on it or 12 scores on it.

30:20.783 --> 30:21.804
That's modern.

30:21.884 --> 30:26.230
That cost them a lot of money, but that's up to date.

30:26.210 --> 30:29.195
So A&M is, well, we're still in the top 10.

30:29.255 --> 30:31.318
I'd say we're still in the top 10, you know.

30:32.019 --> 30:33.822
That's about the only thing that I could think of.

30:33.982 --> 30:43.037
And where should A&M hope, where should A&M expect to try to

30:43.304 --> 30:49.898
average in the NCAA finishes in track?

30:49.918 --> 30:59.760
Well, being in the top 20 is great, and we're in the top 20, I think.

31:01.107 --> 31:05.334
Man, the top ten would be good if you can make it to the top ten or whatever, you know.

31:05.434 --> 31:07.558
It's an off-and-on situation.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.405
Now, Arkansas has been dominating it now.

31:11.485 --> 31:22.103
I don't really know how they have done that well, but they have dominated track indoors and outdoors and across country, you know.
