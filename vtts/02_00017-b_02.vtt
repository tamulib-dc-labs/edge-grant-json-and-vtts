WEBVTT

00:00:02.782 --> 00:00:31.759
uh alarms any warnings any threats any telephone calls yeah we had a certain number of those all through the years you know during final week you know you'd get your fire alarms and and you'd also get bomb threats and you'd get all sorts of things over the telephone oh over the telephone and then you'd have to evacuate the building and all all of that and stand outside in the heat or the rain or something but but you know you'd have uh

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:56.582
you'd have alarms and sometimes you just have a short out someplace and you'd have every all alarms go off and you'd have to leave you know that happened but no we did have our share of that and you know and as i i was quoted out of context one of bob's colleagues was i think head of the geology department now um i

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:11.104
I really find this amusing because all of the streaking, all of this stuff that goes on in the library seems to always happen in the spring.

00:01:11.164 --> 00:01:16.772
And I was quoted in the battalion as saying, well, yes, it just happens every spring.

00:01:17.272 --> 00:01:22.840
And out of context, it sounds like, boy, what's this woman like?

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:32.748
And for you, when the streaking did occur, you library professionals, what did you all do?

00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:46.169
Well, of course, we just, I can't, I don't think I was ever actually on duty when there was, but, you know, you always heard about it, and you called, you called the security, is what you did immediately.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.573
But you all did not attempt to apprehend them?

00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:51.898
No, no, no, no, no, nobody would ever have done that, no, no.

00:01:52.418 --> 00:01:55.493
And the streakers never did any damage to the,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.224
As far as I know, no, they just caused a commotion.

00:01:59.805 --> 00:02:01.867
And they probably did it just on a dare.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:06.533
Somebody probably, they were having a party someplace and said, I dare you to do this.

00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:09.997
And so I think that's probably just what happened there.

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:17.606
They're just, I don't think there were, I really doubt, seriously doubt if they're the only one that had, I mentioned the toe biter.

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:20.970
He was the only one I think had a really serious problem.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.712
The other ones were just pranks.

00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:28.218
Now, I don't know about how it's been lately in the last few years, but it could happen.

00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:35.086
Now, I have heard many stories from corps members about good bull, meaning pranks on each other.

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:38.009
By and large, that didn't occur in the library.

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:39.851
No, it wouldn't have happened in the library.

00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:40.491
That's right.

00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:41.533
I don't think so.

00:02:41.693 --> 00:02:44.396
I doubt that.

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:52.024
Like, typist, this is another editorial note.

00:02:53.692 --> 00:03:04.367
Sterling Evans, what led him to be so library concerned, what led him to be so interested in the library.

00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:19.108
His voice broke a little with emotion when he said that when he got here as a 17-year-old freshman in 1917 that Tommy Mayo, a member of the English Department who was then the

00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:32.058
library director made the library such a pleasant place for a scared country boy to come and study that from then on he always was concerned about the library.

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:39.831
Did you and your colleagues feel that you all were at the heart, the intellectual heart of the university?

00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:53.839
Well, I really think you are, whether it's maybe, I don't know if I put it in just those terms, but you have to have, you just have to have the library facility.

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:57.027
Now, the libraries have gone through,

00:03:57.361 --> 00:04:00.286
such tremendous changes through the years.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:08.981
Not just this one, but all university libraries, all public libraries, all of the libraries seen has developed.

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:16.534
And, you know, I think sometimes the very esoteric librarians

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.146
in academe seem to forget that we're here to serve a public, not just to find the answer to a question.

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:23.887
I mean, you do that.

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:30.675
But they seem to forget that you have who or whom your constituencies are.

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:42.628
And we know, I hope that I have always known and I've always treated a student with the same degree of courtesy that I would treat a faculty member.

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:44.310
I mean, I hope I have been like that.

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:55.888
As you went to national professional meetings, did you get the impression that A&M, what was happening here, was happening most other places also?

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:57.271
Oh, I think so.

00:04:57.351 --> 00:05:05.067
It was during the time when we had all this proliferation of

00:05:05.603 --> 00:05:18.263
of scientific journals whether they were social sciences or science or you know this was a time when and everybody didn't know really what to do with them now they're they're coming to grips with some of these problems but that we all had this

00:05:18.597 --> 00:05:24.903
And, you know, people, microfilm turned out not to be the end-all, be-all for everything.

00:05:25.343 --> 00:05:32.510
But as I said earlier, you have to do something with the amount of material that you have.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.154
You can't keep building these large buildings to store.

00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:40.397
I mean, right now, this new facility is wonderful.

00:05:40.497 --> 00:05:47.203
I told the powers that be the other day when I was over here for a friends meeting, I felt like Mrs. Rip Van Winkle.

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:48.245
I really did.

00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:50.108
It's just incredible.

00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:54.995
And that lovely, lovely area down on the first floor.

00:05:55.035 --> 00:05:58.801
I know it's brand new and it hasn't been trashed yet.

00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:03.268
And it doesn't look like anybody had even kicked the...

00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:06.573
in the end of a table or anything.

00:06:06.653 --> 00:06:08.376
It just looks lovely.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:13.003
And here again, I was struck by how quiet it was.

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.666
This never happened.

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:17.691
Before, you'd come in the door, and there was always noise here.

00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.393
There was always noise in circulation.

00:06:19.854 --> 00:06:22.478
Now, that's all quiet again.

00:06:22.678 --> 00:06:24.021
And that's kind of interesting.

00:06:24.061 --> 00:06:28.508
Now, maybe on the other floors, it isn't quite as quiet as it was downstairs.

00:06:28.528 --> 00:06:31.332
But I was impressed with that when I walked in today.

00:06:32.088 --> 00:06:39.338
Now, did funding seem to get better for the library comparatively in the, was it the 80s?

00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:46.047
I don't think it really got better until the 80s when the computer scene kept, you know, we had to get it better.

00:06:46.107 --> 00:06:49.772
But in the meantime, you had to build your collections.

00:06:50.614 --> 00:06:55.260
You just couldn't put it into all of the bells and whistles of the computer age.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.656
And there's a new system here now.

00:06:58.756 --> 00:07:03.026
Well, we remember when we got that first online system.

00:07:03.747 --> 00:07:06.874
This was the state of the art.

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:08.537
I don't want to go back over all that.

00:07:08.577 --> 00:07:12.185
But anyway, this has to change.

00:07:12.726 --> 00:07:16.354
When the needs of people change, and with the

00:07:16.975 --> 00:07:23.445
the technological development of all the different kinds of systems that they have and the internet.

00:07:23.906 --> 00:07:28.714
My, this is a whole different world than when we came those many years ago.

00:07:28.754 --> 00:07:30.136
It's entirely different.

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:36.727
We used to talk with our, well, we used to correspond by memo.

00:07:37.188 --> 00:07:38.650
Now you wouldn't think of doing that.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.658
On any level, you correspond by email.

00:07:44.684 --> 00:07:49.652
I'm about ready, I think, to summarize.

00:07:50.132 --> 00:07:53.437
Are there any topics that we have not mentioned that we should have?

00:07:53.457 --> 00:08:08.380
I want to mention one person who was a science reference librarian who really, I felt at one point, saved our reference department from just almost falling to pieces.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.924
We'd had several bad scenes there.

00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:13.408
Her name was Julia Rolls.

00:08:13.912 --> 00:08:19.361
R-H-O-L-E-S. She and her husband were divorced.

00:08:19.381 --> 00:08:22.006
Her husband was in the psychology department.

00:08:22.026 --> 00:08:24.190
But she was a wonderful person.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:32.845
She wanted us to really give input into what was here, what was wrong, what was going on.

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:37.152
And I don't think people really believed her.

00:08:37.874 --> 00:08:46.224
To this day, I don't think the classified staff, they're so used to having somebody tell them what to do and do it now or up and out.

00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:51.711
But you see, she really wanted their input on how to do things.

00:08:52.171 --> 00:08:54.034
And she was serious.

00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:58.059
And she's gone on to a good job.

00:08:58.119 --> 00:09:06.649
I think she's at Chicago Circle, University of Chicago, downtown, whatever.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.065
Anyway, University of Illinois, Chicago Circle, I think that's what it is.

00:09:11.085 --> 00:09:12.967
Anyway, that is an important where she is now.

00:09:13.027 --> 00:09:15.750
But she was a wonderful person to know.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:25.662
And she was having a very, very difficult time in her own private life when she was having to tackle some of the very difficult problems that we had here.

00:09:26.623 --> 00:09:30.628
At some point in time, Dr. Hoadley wanted to

00:09:31.199 --> 00:09:33.022
Now, of course, it is this way.

00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:39.692
The documents are meshed with the science and the social sciences.

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:45.140
Each has been divided up as appropriately as you could do that.

00:09:45.741 --> 00:09:57.358
But at some particular time, the library director thought that we should meld documents with

00:09:58.047 --> 00:10:19.633
one of the with with the with the reference with reference well it just it just wasn't it wasn't the time to do it it wasn't going to work and everyone was very upset very very upset and so as i said i i will always be grateful to julia rolls for holding us together

00:10:20.305 --> 00:10:46.718
and trusting us enough to think that you know we could a lot of this a lot of this I missed because I was upstairs in documents and of course we were all expecting well we did we came back from documents into reference and but it but it never was going to meld until we had somebody who we had this first of all we had to have the space to do it there was no way we could have ever done any anything without the space we were all we would always be

00:10:47.018 --> 00:10:51.622
pot boiling, figuring out how we were going to put this there and this there.

00:10:51.682 --> 00:10:52.923
We never could move anything.

00:10:53.624 --> 00:10:56.847
And, of course, it's probably, looking back, that's probably good.

00:10:56.927 --> 00:11:04.474
Now that this major, these major moves have been made, well, then they can work on another 20, 30 years down the road.

00:11:04.674 --> 00:11:06.155
I can see that happening.

00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:13.782
And who knows what they're going to be like, what libraries will be like 20 or maybe even 10 years from now.

00:11:13.862 --> 00:11:14.443
I don't know.

00:11:15.098 --> 00:11:23.274
In your, in all of your years here, what were the most difficult tasks that you had and the most pleasant tasks that you had?

00:11:23.314 --> 00:11:24.977
Difficult tasks?

00:11:26.741 --> 00:11:31.470
I had some very difficult people to,

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.312
Well, you know, to supervise.

00:11:36.372 --> 00:11:43.380
Supervision, you know, this big institution has a lot of different people.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:58.335
I have, I found that, I like supervision, but I find I had to, I probably am too easygoing a person, I won't say nice, but I just am too,

00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:07.318
kind-hearted to make some of the decisions that I might have had to make, even though I should probably have made them.

00:12:07.338 --> 00:12:12.505
Well, I made them, but that wasn't exactly my thing.

00:12:13.126 --> 00:12:21.699
As I said very early on, I made a much better Indian behind the scenes doing what I should do than the chief.

00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:25.504
I wasn't cut out to be a chief.

00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:29.897
Right, and then the most pleasant, the most enjoyable.

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:34.163
The most pleasant, well I have always enjoyed, I just enjoy working with people.

00:12:34.443 --> 00:12:36.827
I'm a people, they say, people person.

00:12:37.427 --> 00:12:42.735
I really enjoyed it and I enjoyed all aspects of that, even the difficult ones I enjoyed.

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:48.403
Of those, all those years, what were your proudest moments?

00:12:49.565 --> 00:12:53.992
Well, I did get an award, a faculty achievement award.

00:12:54.473 --> 00:13:03.747
And yeah, I don't know if we got, no, we didn't get watches, but we got something anyway over here.

00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:06.251
I think we got a check rather than a watch.

00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:09.335
I think we had money that we put in the bank.

00:13:09.696 --> 00:13:10.737
But that was very nice.

00:13:12.961 --> 00:13:16.066
Kathy Jackson got the first one, and I think I got the second one.

00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.648
How did you learn you had won?

00:13:18.151 --> 00:13:26.785
Well, I think that somebody did tell me that I was going to win it, and I was really shocked, to be honest.

00:13:27.687 --> 00:13:33.837
It's very appropriate that they should recognize their staff, and they should.

00:13:34.758 --> 00:13:43.973
And I think that's a, I mean, maybe the, yeah, well, anyway, it was very,

00:13:44.594 --> 00:13:49.340
I have the feeling that in some ways it's a much more complicated organization than it was.

00:13:49.821 --> 00:13:54.027
But in some ways it's become a lot more impersonal.

00:13:54.047 --> 00:13:56.630
It would have to with the size and the way it's grown.

00:13:57.051 --> 00:14:01.998
But it's still, in spite of everything, it's still Aggieland.

00:14:02.719 --> 00:14:06.364
And we wouldn't want it to be any different.

00:14:06.384 --> 00:14:07.345
It's still Aggieland.

00:14:07.325 --> 00:14:14.797
Now, is there something that you think is distinctive about the Texas A&M Library and the way it does its task?

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:20.105
Since I worked here for so many years, I can't be the judge.

00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:24.632
I mean, I know it's totally different from the public library situation.

00:14:25.373 --> 00:14:33.265
But I think that most academic libraries have pretty much the same kinds of problems and they just have to,

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:46.332
those leaders of those directors are, and of course they're now, let's see, Dr. Heath is also, he's not, what is his title?

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:47.653
It's not just Dean.

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:48.274
Dean.

00:14:48.514 --> 00:14:49.555
Dean, that's what I was thinking.

00:14:49.575 --> 00:14:50.276
Dean and director.

00:14:50.296 --> 00:15:02.307
Well, that I think helps him with his colleagues in the administration to kind of keep things going.

00:15:02.675 --> 00:15:10.244
Irene, although she didn't probably, I think she was at a disadvantage in some ways that she wasn't a dean.

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:18.754
But I think there were enough people who disliked her so much that she would never have become a dean under any circumstances.

00:15:18.854 --> 00:15:25.442
And as things turned out, well, she came back after her tenure here.

00:15:25.422 --> 00:15:33.141
And I think she did, Sterling Evans created a spot for her, you know, a professorship here.

00:15:33.562 --> 00:15:42.283
And I think she did do that and she was working with the National Library Association a whole lot.

00:15:42.466 --> 00:15:54.381
But I don't, but anyway, it was, we lived, the last few years I was here were some, you know, before Fred came were some very, very difficult years here.

00:15:55.222 --> 00:16:00.329
And as I said, the whole fabric was about to just go apart.

00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:00.970
Well, it didn't.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:08.980
It kept together and I attribute a lot of that to the, to a lot of common sense on

00:16:09.618 --> 00:16:14.110
of the people who were here at that time.

00:16:14.972 --> 00:16:19.645
Looking back over all these years, to whom do you feel most grateful?

00:16:20.806 --> 00:16:24.392
Well, I am grateful to a lot of people here, really, really.

00:16:24.633 --> 00:16:36.493
I really feel, well, for one thing, I'm grateful that I know so many faculty, and still do, in the social sciences and humanities.

00:16:36.613 --> 00:16:43.084
I'm still glad to know all of you, and I still

00:16:44.178 --> 00:16:54.113
You know, you get, if you work in an organization like this, you get to, some of the staff you get so attached to, they're just like family to you.

00:16:54.874 --> 00:17:09.015
Because you have to, you have, my son who is now in an administrative position in a firm in Fort Collins, an environmental firm, hears all these sob stories and he really doesn't really enjoy that.

00:17:09.115 --> 00:17:12.160
I said, well, listen, grow up, fella.

00:17:13.844 --> 00:17:14.865
the name of the game.

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:17.648
You're going to be an administrator or a supervisor.

00:17:17.688 --> 00:17:20.791
You're going to hear some interesting, interesting things.

00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:22.512
It's all part of it.

00:17:22.813 --> 00:17:25.235
Closest professional friends for you?

00:17:25.635 --> 00:17:27.457
Well, closest professional friends.

00:17:27.858 --> 00:17:32.742
Actually, we didn't have, you know, I mean, we had friends.

00:17:33.923 --> 00:17:37.187
Well, I love Sandra Conturbia.

00:17:37.707 --> 00:17:40.830
She's in documents.

00:17:40.996 --> 00:17:42.758
She was a good friend.

00:17:42.899 --> 00:17:49.268
All of the faculty, some of the faculty, you would want to keep their distance.

00:17:49.488 --> 00:17:54.255
Good friends, Mel Dodd was a good friend.

00:17:55.216 --> 00:17:58.240
And Hal Hall was a good friend.

00:17:58.901 --> 00:18:00.043
And we didn't know them well.

00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:04.429
I didn't know them socially or anything like that.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.134
But I did know them here.

00:18:08.536 --> 00:18:11.600
And you could always depend on these people.

00:18:12.161 --> 00:18:23.137
Katherine Jackson, Dr. Jackson, the very controversial Dr. Jackson, was always a good friend to those people who were loyal to her.

00:18:23.798 --> 00:18:26.222
And as I say, I have such conflicting emotions.

00:18:26.322 --> 00:18:31.810
I can see what happened to her was just the time that it was.

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:37.065
And you have to be concerned with harassment.

00:18:37.105 --> 00:18:39.528
You have to be concerned with all of this.

00:18:39.608 --> 00:18:43.673
You have to be very careful how you deal with minorities.

00:18:44.273 --> 00:18:46.776
You have to be very careful how you deal with people.

00:18:46.936 --> 00:18:51.021
It's not the way it was in the olden days that you could knock heads together.

00:18:51.041 --> 00:18:52.143
You can't do that anymore.

00:18:52.183 --> 00:18:54.285
That isn't going to work.

00:18:54.305 --> 00:19:00.953
And so as I say, Dr. Jackson, Kathy, I consider her a friend too.

00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:02.544
Evelyn King was a friend.

00:19:03.466 --> 00:19:04.308
They're good friends.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.593
But I don't see them very often.

00:19:06.874 --> 00:19:10.883
What other topics have we not covered?

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:14.571
Well, we've done a- I've only got two more questions I can think of.

00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:18.717
Have I not answered one of your questions very well?

00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:19.959
No, no, this is fine.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:27.831
I'm just trying to think because there are things that you see I wouldn't know to ask about and that's why I'm trying to be very general.

00:19:28.192 --> 00:19:42.735
All right, then the last two questions I can think of is if someone gave you a million dollar check with one requirement that you had to pass it on to Texas A&M, what would you want that check used for?

00:19:42.935 --> 00:19:55.308
Well, if it were going to be for the library, I could definitely want to do something over in Don's bailiwick in the archives.

00:19:56.129 --> 00:20:04.277
And because, you know, I'm so impressed with what he's done over there in the last few years.

00:20:04.397 --> 00:20:09.803
And I would also want to do something for the classified staff

00:20:10.188 --> 00:20:13.491
well, probably public services, since I was in public services.

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:20.419
And it's kind of like this question, when I win the lottery kind of thing.

00:20:21.059 --> 00:20:27.246
But that's about right, and I would certainly want to do something for, I think, the student scholarships.

00:20:27.806 --> 00:20:31.590
Bob and I are very interested in trying to give back some.

00:20:31.691 --> 00:20:37.917
He has given some back in geology.

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:41.888
And I have given back to my college.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:54.224
And what we have, if there's some over, we definitely feel that we want to give back to the community.

00:20:55.226 --> 00:21:03.617
And of course, as I said, I was the most reluctant of dragons when I came down here kicking and screaming.

00:21:03.968 --> 00:21:08.633
who had moved from Denver, Colorado to Bryan College Station, Texas.

00:21:08.693 --> 00:21:12.316
I thought she was going to live here more than she absolutely have to.

00:21:12.356 --> 00:21:13.057
Ho, ho, ho.

00:21:13.557 --> 00:21:14.138
Here I am.

00:21:14.478 --> 00:21:18.402
I'm in total agreement with you, because I felt the same way.

00:21:21.345 --> 00:21:27.171
Then the last question I can think of is, what are your feelings?

00:21:27.411 --> 00:21:27.751
Oh, no.

00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:29.453
Next to last.

00:21:30.494 --> 00:21:32.676
Looking at the library as you now view it,

00:21:33.162 --> 00:21:35.806
How would you describe, is it making progress?

00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:37.429
Is it moving forward?

00:21:37.449 --> 00:21:44.900
Well, I mean, as I said a few minutes ago, you know, I just felt like I was Mrs. Whipp Van Winkle when I saw everything back in place.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:54.495
See, I've been visiting back here from time to time and would visit when they were all moved over here before they redid this building.

00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:58.945
And so I've been coming back maybe once a year anyway.

00:21:58.965 --> 00:22:03.931
I came back one time when Jane Dodd retired.

00:22:03.992 --> 00:22:09.559
She was out of the university.

00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:11.141
She used to be in reference.

00:22:11.241 --> 00:22:15.147
She used to be in the business librarian.

00:22:15.207 --> 00:22:19.032
And then she left to get her CPA.

00:22:19.467 --> 00:22:21.270
And then she worked.

00:22:21.571 --> 00:22:25.178
She worked for some firm in town.

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:35.518
Then the director, this is one good thing that Irene at least had the foresight to do, is to get Jane back here to be the business librarian.

00:22:35.887 --> 00:22:40.092
because she had the knowledge, she had the wherewithal.

00:22:40.872 --> 00:22:46.558
Unfortunately, she had to retire early because she had a serious health problem.

00:22:46.579 --> 00:22:47.660
I think she was diabetic.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:53.686
And the stress of that job, I think, was just a little bit more than she could handle.

00:22:54.287 --> 00:22:58.331
And recently, I've just learned that they're moving back up to Missouri.

00:22:58.591 --> 00:23:01.054
I think they've already left.

00:23:01.234 --> 00:23:02.055
I'm sure they have.

00:23:02.115 --> 00:23:02.856
I'm sure they have.

00:23:03.325 --> 00:23:09.846
Then the last question I have is what feelings do you hold in your heart for Texas A&M?

00:23:09.866 --> 00:23:12.535
Oh, well, very strong feelings, yeah.

00:23:12.555 --> 00:23:13.438
This is where we are.

00:23:13.498 --> 00:23:14.421
This is where we live.

00:23:15.143 --> 00:23:16.086
Very good feelings.
