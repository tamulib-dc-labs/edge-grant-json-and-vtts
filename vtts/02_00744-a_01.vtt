WEBVTT

00:03.389 --> 00:07.374
Okay, Mr. Irvin, would you tell us your full name, 
the date and place of your birth? My name is Barlow

00:08.355 --> 00:10.357
Irvin. I was born in Cotulla, Texas on December 31, 
1903. And could you tell us a little bit about your

00:14.542 --> 00:24.473
early boyhood there in Cotulla and possibly about 
your elementary education on up through high

00:14.542 --> 00:24.473
school? Well, we lived on the Irvin Ranch up until 
about 1909. And then we moved to Cotulla, Texas

00:32.887 --> 00:42.539
where I spent two years and entered Cotulla public 
schools at the age of seven. At that time I

00:43.860 --> 01:00.480
contacted typhoid fever and remained in Cotulla 
for about three months while the rest of my family

00:43.860 --> 01:00.480
moved on to San Antonio where I spent most of my 
early boroughhood days. And can you remember

01:01.085 --> 01:04.148
anything about your education there? In San 
Antonio? Yeah, in San Antonio. Well, we moved to

01:06.351 --> 01:14.600
2001 Main Avenue, which was right across the 
street from the Travis Elementary School. And I

01:15.902 --> 01:25.132
entered there after arriving in San Antonio and 
started my elementary education at Travis

01:15.902 --> 01:25.132
School. I might say at this time that all my sisters 
went through there and also two of my sons. How many

01:32.410 --> 01:34.973
brothers and sisters did you have? I had three 
sisters, no brothers. No brothers. I see. And you

01:41.061 --> 01:42.463
have how many children now? I have two sons, one 
named John Jordan, named after my father, and the

01:42.523 --> 01:50.293
other named Barlow Jr. They both live in Dallas. 
One's in the insurance business and one is an

01:52.716 --> 01:56.441
attorney. Could you tell us your mother's name? My 
mother's name was Edna Barlow Irving. Edna

02:02.441 --> 02:12.574
Barlow, and she was born in De Niro, Texas in 
January, I mean July the 7th,

02:02.441 --> 02:12.574
1875. You know your father's birthday. My father 
was John Jordan Irving. He was born July the 4th,

02:16.680 --> 02:22.728
1872 in Sagin, Texas. I see. Now, after- You went to 
elementary school then. Did you go on into high

02:28.659 --> 02:30.101
school? Yes, after that was done, I left Travis 
School and went to what they called Old Main Avenue

02:30.281 --> 02:48.237
High School, which was situated about a mile and a 
half from my home toward the city, central part of

02:30.281 --> 02:48.237
the city. At those days, they didn't have but one 
high school. That was Old Main Avenue High School.

02:54.663 --> 02:56.344
But in 1918, they built another high school called 
Brackenridge High School, which was situated on

02:56.662 --> 03:03.552
the south side of the city. Do you remember 
anything from your high school experiences? Yes,

03:07.999 --> 03:21.218
and when I went to high school I remember, of 
course, at an early age I took part in athletics,

03:07.999 --> 03:21.218
and when I entered high school I was just fourteen 
and a half years old.

03:23.813 --> 03:26.737
I remember the first football team I played on. I 
was a freshman at the Old Main Avenue, and that was

03:26.757 --> 03:33.867
during the war, 1917 and 1918.

03:35.369 --> 03:39.034
And, of course, we didn't have any place to 
practice. We went to Brackman Park to do our

03:39.475 --> 03:43.180
practicing. And what I remember about that 
particular year was that it was during the war, and

03:43.200 --> 03:53.314
we had a coach whose name was Mr. Vinnie. 
B-E-N-N-E, Benny, who was an old Haskell Indian

03:53.581 --> 04:02.152
coach at that time. And he was in the service, in the 
armed services and situated at Camp Travis in San

04:03.054 --> 04:13.127
Antonio. He wasn't officially, well he wasn't an 
army man, but he was connected with the

04:25.323 --> 04:33.895
In the second year, I played basketball, 
football, and baseball there. In the second and

04:33.915 --> 04:37.159
third year, we always had different coaches. The 
best team we had there was 1922 when we went to the

04:38.901 --> 04:47.593
state quarterfinals. This is in football? In 
football. Could you tell us a little bit about

04:51.138 --> 04:54.182
football, high school football in those days? 
Well,

04:55.208 --> 05:06.785
in San Antonio at that time, there was only one high 
school, two high schools later after 1918, 1919,

04:55.208 --> 05:06.785
1920, and 21. And we had what they called the 
Academic League, which involved the two high

05:07.506 --> 05:20.124
schools, San Antonio Academy, West Texas 
Military Academy, and Peacock Military Academy.

05:20.144 --> 05:23.950
And besides playing what was called the Academic 
League, And then later on, then we played smaller

05:24.487 --> 05:30.756
schools around that area in San Antonio. Football 
in those days was a practice.

05:37.305 --> 05:48.341
The last coach I had was a man named Spitz Clark, who 
was a University of Texas coach and played with the

05:37.305 --> 05:48.341
famed 2nd Texas Infantry. Probably not many 
people remember that team, but it was during the

05:48.361 --> 05:53.228
war at that time and amassed a very, very great 
record in army football and service football at

05:53.917 --> 06:02.906
that time. And they had mostly the players were 
from the Texas schools and they had four or five

06:02.926 --> 06:13.176
outstanding ones from Texas A&M. I see. Then after 
you graduated from high school, then did you go on

06:16.759 --> 06:21.544
directly to A&M? Yes, after I graduated from high 
school, I came to A&M here in the fall of 1922. Why

06:27.087 --> 06:30.173
did you come to A&M? Why here? Well, because of two 
or three reasons. One, because I had a ranching

06:34.180 --> 06:37.866
background. All my forefathers and fathers and 
grandparents were ranch people. And secondly, I

06:43.537 --> 06:46.502
had friends that were coming here. And thirdly, I 
was interested in some form of agriculture, which

06:46.972 --> 06:54.764
I didn't ever pursue. Did you have any thoughts 
then of playing football when you came here? Yes,

06:58.670 --> 07:03.217
that was one of the reasons I came here. At that 
time, Mr. Bible was coach, and

07:03.597 --> 07:15.375
I was very much involved in athletics and in 
football at that time, and I came here. You see, at

07:16.182 --> 07:35.032
that time A&M had just beaten Center College, as 
you probably know, and they were a nationally

07:16.182 --> 07:35.032
known team, and I wanted to come to A&M because of 
Mr. Bible. He was the head coach here at that time,

07:35.092 --> 07:42.544
and the fact that A&M had made a wonderful record up 
to 1922, you see. And I had visions of playing and

07:46.110 --> 07:52.759
making my letter here, besides going to school. 
Okay, when you started, what were some of your

07:54.341 --> 08:00.029
first impressions when you arrived in 1922 of the 
university? Well, Helen, at that time the only way

08:01.251 --> 08:04.976
you could come to A&M was by train. The Missouri 
Pacific and Southern came here by train from San

08:11.617 --> 08:27.743
Antonio and we used to get off at Milano Junction 
and switched and came down and picked the train

08:11.617 --> 08:27.743
that came out of Fort Worth down here. And it was, we 
got off at the old station which has been torn down

08:27.763 --> 08:39.902
at the west end of the campus right across, the old 
tracks are still there.

08:41.047 --> 08:47.917
A&M was a school for me because of the traditions 
and the heritage that they had. At that time there

08:48.157 --> 08:55.848
were a number of people from the high school that I 
attended that came here too. Do you remember how

08:57.431 --> 09:04.100
your first days and weeks here, how it impressed 
you? What experiences you had as a freshman? Well,

09:06.243 --> 09:07.425
I came here.

09:12.181 --> 09:17.952
And one reason I got in that was because the first 
sergeant was Fred Jagie. He was a teacher here in

09:18.553 --> 09:25.286
the veterinarian, in the veterinarian 
department now. Coach retired. And I knew him

09:30.195 --> 09:34.223
quite well because I played football with him in 
high school.

09:44.632 --> 09:52.239
and I happened to be his room orderly my freshman 
year, and I lived next door to him. But A&M at that

09:53.340 --> 10:06.292
time was

09:53.340 --> 10:06.292
purely military, because I never did acquire any, 
never did go over high military because I wasn't

09:53.340 --> 10:06.292
interested in it very much. The only thing they had 
in those days was what they called the casuals,

10:08.414 --> 10:12.698
they were people

10:17.892 --> 10:26.041
I forgot the names of those two dormitories they 
had there, but Military Walker and everything was

10:17.892 --> 10:26.041
military at that time. And during my freshman 
year, of course, it was pretty, the hazing was

10:28.184 --> 10:34.010
pretty severe.

10:36.793 --> 10:45.123
The fact of the business, the more they haze you, 
the better

10:36.793 --> 10:45.123
they liked you. Oh, my. Of course at that time they 
had what they called the Junior Banquet. Are you

10:48.620 --> 10:49.602
familiar with that? The old Junior Banquet? No 
sir, I'm not. Well that was when the president had

10:52.706 --> 11:01.757
this Junior Banquet and they had a whole week of it. 
They tried to get the headmaster of the Junior

11:02.878 --> 11:09.887
Banquet or the president of it, or he would be 
disguised and they would try to catch him, you see,

11:10.407 --> 11:19.077
before he went into this banquet on a certain 
particular day. And of course, everybody was

11:19.257 --> 11:23.643
involved in it, including the freshmen. And it 
was, they finally did away with the junior banquet

11:23.663 --> 11:36.898
because it was really gotten out of hand and the 
people in the authorities finally did away with

11:23.663 --> 11:36.898
it. But A&M at that time was just, it was, I wouldn't 
call it a cow college, but it was a great

11:42.183 --> 11:46.048
institution. And most of the times, the military 
end of it, and plus the educational end of it, had

11:46.889 --> 11:56.680
grown immensely. And it was a, you look back, A&M 
today is not the A&M of the 20s. We all know that.

12:09.858 --> 12:12.741
Well, did you start playing football your 
freshman year? Yes, I played football under

12:12.761 --> 12:17.025
Colonel Frank Anderson. Colonel Frank Anderson. 
He still lives here, and he was a track coach. Oh, I

12:21.650 --> 12:22.891
see. What was this then, a freshman team? A 
freshman team. You see, back in those days, they

12:25.734 --> 12:28.196
had a freshman team. And what I'm reminded about 
the freshman team was that after we had won, A&M had

12:28.497 --> 12:37.806
gotten All this publicity, or you might say 
national recognition on account of beating Santa

12:39.693 --> 12:44.600
College. And on that team, we had about 18, I think 
about 15 to 18 high school captains that came here

12:45.501 --> 12:58.520
to be a member of the freshman team. And we had a good 
season. We played six or seven games and didn't

12:59.982 --> 13:04.208
lose but won. I think that was Sam Houston College 
at that time. Can you remember some of the other

13:07.212 --> 13:09.295
opponents you played? I played the Port Arthur 
Pirates, that was the semi-pro team at Port

13:09.950 --> 13:14.958
Arthur. Mm-hmm. San Houston State Teachers, St. 
Edward's, Allen Academy.

13:22.729 --> 13:24.833
I don't know, I played five games. Mm-hmm. And then 
when you moved into your sophomore year, did you

13:27.697 --> 13:31.723
then move up to the varsity then? Yes, I moved up to 
the varsity. See, in those days, Mr. Bible was the

13:35.212 --> 13:38.575
owner. He was the head coach, and we had a line 
coach. We didn't have many coaches. And he didn't

13:45.822 --> 13:48.585
give many letters. See, all the three years that I 
lettered in football, he didn't give over 15

13:48.605 --> 13:55.832
varsity letters.

13:58.555 --> 14:00.797
And so it was pretty tough to make. My sophomore 
year, there weren't but three of us that lettered

14:01.351 --> 14:10.462
that year, and one was Norman Dansby, who lived in 
Bryan, and one was Mule Wilson, who later played

14:01.351 --> 14:10.462
professional football. And myself was only three 
sophomores that lettered that year. What were the

14:14.788 --> 14:16.750
requirements for lettering at that time? Do you 
remember? Was it a personal thing? Well, yes, it

14:18.753 --> 14:20.335
was. You had to—we really didn't have any—well, it 
did, too. I have the rules out there in the

14:25.401 --> 14:28.205
university now. We have the rules that were set up. 
But during the 20s, I don't think we had any exact

14:31.557 --> 14:35.462
rules. You had to play so many minutes. It finally 
went into that you had to play so many minutes. And I

14:41.870 --> 14:55.287
know my year that I lettered, my sophomore year, 
because I played most of the Rice game after Bull

14:41.870 --> 14:55.287
Johnson, who was supposed to have been one of the 
All-Southwest Conference guards.

15:07.096 --> 15:08.317
beat a seven to nothing. That was the first defeat 
they had by a conference team in 1923. And then it

15:16.705 --> 15:23.352
went on in 24 and we had a very fairly good team that 
year. The records indicate I think we had about a

15:24.132 --> 15:30.459
seventh, had a six for four record. But most of 
these players that In 1924, we were defeated in

15:35.058 --> 15:44.571
Austin

15:35.058 --> 15:44.571
by a score of seven to nothing. And that was 
beginning—that's when the Memorial Stadium was

15:46.053 --> 15:50.760
dedicated, actually. That was the first year, 
1924. It was also the beginning of the Memorial

15:53.163 --> 15:56.327
Stadium jinx. Yeah, that's right. And it was a 
peculiar game. The game seesawed back and forth.

16:04.758 --> 16:10.769
We had a little boy named Bob Berry threw a pass and 
it deflected. No, Texas threw a pass and our

16:10.809 --> 16:24.092
defensive man deflected the ball and it went into 
the arms of one of the Texas players and he ran for

16:10.809 --> 16:24.092
touchdown and that was all of it. Seven to nothing. 
In those days the scores weren't very high. Did you

16:28.940 --> 16:30.842
play both ways then? Yes, we played both ways. We 
didn't have any offense and defense.

16:38.470 --> 16:41.352
In fact, you had to be in pretty fair shape. Of 
course, your opponent had to be in good shape too

16:41.413 --> 16:46.157
because you made substitutions. They weren't 
substituted as a whole team. Individually, they

16:52.243 --> 16:54.846
were substituted mostly.

16:58.623 --> 17:01.427
The Southwest Conference has grown 
tremendously. In those days, A&M and Texas,

17:02.789 --> 17:10.901
either one of them won the conference, up until 
Baylor and SMU got into the picture. And that's

17:12.444 --> 17:25.363
when Ray Morrison started his, Ray Morrison was 
the coach at SMU when he had his good teams in 23, and

17:12.444 --> 17:25.363
I forgot the other one, he won the Southwest 
Conference. And then Frank Bridges came along at

17:25.383 --> 17:27.887
Baylor. and won the conference in 22 and 24, I 
believe. That's to my recollection, to show it in

17:31.741 --> 17:38.507
there. But they got into, they were tired of A&M and 
Texas dominating the athletic scene, so they got

17:38.527 --> 17:52.140
into this, what we call now,

17:38.527 --> 17:52.140
proselytizing. I don't wanna. Is this maybe the 
beginning of the heavy recruiting? Yes. And I hate

18:00.520 --> 18:04.667
to say this, but it's the starting of it. You see, 
during those days, everybody paid their own way.

18:10.396 --> 18:17.808
See, it was an honor to win your varsity letter, but 
the boys that played football in those days, we

18:10.396 --> 18:17.808
didn't have anything such as scholarship. That 
was unknown in those days.

18:23.420 --> 18:39.743
I might say that SMU and Baylor and some of these 
other schools, in order to keep step with the other

18:23.420 --> 18:39.743
two state schools, they started giving 
scholarships, which enticed the players to their

18:23.420 --> 18:39.743
institution. I see. Now at this time, when you were 
playing football at A&M, did you live with the

18:42.086 --> 18:47.273
other members of the cadet corps? Oh, yes. Do you 
think this was a good thing? Yes, I do. Except

18:51.325 --> 19:06.843
during the football season, and I haven't got up to 
the 25 team yet, but we would live in what they call

18:51.325 --> 19:06.843
the postgraduate hall, which is located, was 
located by where the old hospital was. They call it

19:07.764 --> 19:09.466
the graduate hall. A lot of the professionals 
lived there. And during the season, we would move

19:11.568 --> 19:17.355
over there for three months and then move back 
there

19:20.525 --> 19:22.988
I'm saying for the players to live with it. Don't 
you think maybe it kept you closer to the rest of the

19:23.008 --> 19:26.252
student body? Yes, it would have because I

19:26.473 --> 19:45.377
know in my case, I got to know the roommates and then 
also the people in my dormitory after the season

19:26.473 --> 19:45.377
was over, I became just one of them. And they were 
more interested in me.

19:52.098 --> 19:57.504
there, fellow?

19:57.564 --> 19:58.485
It's probably too bad. I doubt if it would work 
anymore today, but it's an interesting idea.

20:03.050 --> 20:09.757
Well, see it's like everything else, it's grown 
out of proportion and I doubt very seriously

20:03.050 --> 20:09.757
whether it would work now. You see, as we get to this 
new dormitory we have here, things are just out of

20:09.817 --> 20:17.886
proportion. It's not like it used to Yes, I 
suppose. That's progress, you see. Now, would you

20:26.033 --> 20:27.815
tell us about the 25 team? Well, up to 25, you see, we 
hadn't had a good team in 23 and 24. And this 25 team

20:32.441 --> 20:38.849
was mostly, a good many of them were the boys that 
came here as freshmen. We played together. And the

20:40.992 --> 20:51.805
25 team, we weren't a very outstanding team, but we 
were good enough to win the Southwest Conference,

20:40.992 --> 20:51.805
which we hadn't won since back in

21:01.184 --> 21:07.031
Neil Wilson, who was a great punter and a great 
football player, and a little boy by the name of Bob

21:01.184 --> 21:07.031
Berry. He wasn't over five feet five. And the other 
one, we had a Japanese named Taro Kishi who played a

21:10.436 --> 21:19.547
lot. He was a Japanese boy. And he played one 
halfback, and Wilson the other, and we had a little

21:22.871 --> 21:30.060
boy named McGuire playing fullback. Barry. But 
what made that team finally gel was the fact that

21:33.040 --> 21:40.526
Keisha got hurt right before we played Baylor. And 
into the lineup came Joel Hunt, who you've known

21:41.707 --> 21:45.571
about. As goes the saying, be in the right place at 
the right time. Up to that time, Joel was unknown

21:50.135 --> 22:00.604
because he had been in Waco High School and he was 
sort of understudied to, I forgot the name of that,

21:50.135 --> 22:00.604
Booty Johnson up there. But we were playing Baylor 
at that time, and up to that part of the season, we

22:01.799 --> 22:09.271
hadn't been defeated. But Kisha got hurt, and they 
inserted Joel in there, and he just ran wild. He

22:16.542 --> 22:21.010
scored two touchdowns on pretty good-sized runs, 
which we didn't have that then. We won the game

22:21.030 --> 22:22.592
14-7. From then on, we gained momentum, and we 
continued on and won the rest of our games. except

22:30.622 --> 22:41.039
for TCU in which there was a high wind blowing and 
they beat us three to nothing on the field goal. But

22:41.059 --> 22:52.598
we came back and defeated Rice and then defeated 
Texas 28 to nothing, the biggest score that's ever

22:41.059 --> 22:52.598
been run up against Texas in the history of A&M and 
Texas series. So we won the conference

23:04.203 --> 23:07.748
Did you play any bowl games, any bowl games that 
year? No, the bowl game was not, they hadn't come

23:07.788 --> 23:10.812
into existence at that time. There were a few 
around occasionally, weren't they? Yeah. But

23:13.176 --> 23:14.117
they weren't every year. See the Cotton Bowl 
didn't, bowls didn't start until the thirties,

23:14.217 --> 23:19.986
thirties. I think T.C. and Marquette played the 
first bowl game. What do you think was your best

23:24.853 --> 23:26.235
game? Oh, I don't know.

23:33.768 --> 23:38.193
You must have one game you felt that stood out, that 
you felt you played your best in. Well, I guess I

23:39.635 --> 23:47.044
wasn't, I was just good in the state, but I wasn't an 
outstanding football player. I mean, I guess that

23:47.064 --> 23:56.115
the best game I played was when I was a sophomore 
against Texas. Hm. They put me into the lineup when

23:56.395 --> 24:00.961
they had the ball on the one yard line. Mm-hm.

24:08.311 --> 24:10.394
mind stood out that way. I would think so. 
Especially if they ran at your position each time.

24:14.399 --> 24:19.085
Well now after you graduated, what did you do? Well 
I went back to San Antonio and then

24:19.225 --> 24:28.396
this fella named Jim Kendricks who was quite a 
character. He had been playing professional

24:30.599 --> 24:35.365
football up in New York in the east for about 10 
years

24:39.277 --> 24:50.709
And so he had been given the position as the coach 
and manager of the Buffalo Bisons, who was a member

24:39.277 --> 24:50.709
of the National Professional Football Team. And 
he gathered up a bunch of A&M, three A&M players,

24:53.352 --> 25:07.427
myself, Neil Wilson, and Neely Allison, and we had 
about five from Oklahoma and one from Trinity. And

25:08.892 --> 25:16.742
we didn't, I don't think we had a Texas boy, and we 
had four from Baylor that had played in 1922. Top

25:16.782 --> 25:27.595
Weathers, and Wesley Bradshaw, and Riley Biggs, 
and another one I'll think of in a minute. And we

25:27.615 --> 25:30.839
didn't have the 16 or 17 players. But the unique 
thing about this whole deal was that we traveled in

25:30.899 --> 25:38.528
Model D cars. Had to start out in advance, didn't 
you? Yeah, and so this fellow, he was a character in

25:41.967 --> 25:46.872
himself.

25:50.556 --> 25:54.600
We started out and we had four Model Ts. We started 
from Texas and those Model Ts. And in this group of

25:57.744 --> 26:03.130
18 players we had, two of them were players, but 
they were mostly mechanics.

26:06.453 --> 26:08.315
Recruited for your mechanical ability. That's 
good. So we went to, we started out and I remember

26:10.165 --> 26:20.294
going on up to Buffalo and of course it was an 
experience for me.

26:23.477 --> 26:37.170
And Kendricks was a player and coach and manager,

26:23.477 --> 26:37.170
but he was a hard taskmaster. He had been coached 
under Charlie Moran, who had quite a history here

26:39.477 --> 26:43.302
at A&M. He was sort of a disciple of Moran. And at 
heart, he was good, but he was strict. And we really

26:51.673 --> 26:56.880
got into, we would practice. We'd get up, and I want 
to have two meals a day, and we all stayed in this one

26:57.861 --> 27:09.096
big boarding house on Main Street in Buffalo, and 
we would get up in the morning and eat late

26:57.861 --> 27:09.096
breakfast around 10.30. And then go to the 
practice field and practice until one-thirty at

27:09.802 --> 27:24.461
two and then come back and have our evening meal 
around four-thirty at

27:09.802 --> 27:24.461
five. And we would go to every place we played. And 
in those days they had the New York Giants and the

27:30.149 --> 27:39.201
Yankees and the Buffalo, Chicago Bears, 
Minnesota,

27:40.025 --> 27:57.483
I'm trying to think what they called those, 
Eskimos, Duluth Eskimos, and Providence, Rhode

27:40.025 --> 27:57.483
Island, Pottsville Miners, and those were some of 
the teams that were in the league. But it was the

27:57.503 --> 28:00.186
National Football League at those times. The 
salaries weren't good. I think most of us players

28:14.382 --> 28:16.785
all of our expenses up there were taken care of. But 
that's, you just got paid for a game, not for- For a

28:17.606 --> 28:22.431
game, that's right. And the things I can remember 
about that game was that league we played all over

28:22.451 --> 28:28.838
the East. And we had a good season. We finished 
third in the league, about 15 players. But the

28:36.027 --> 28:43.495
thing I remember about it, the only time we ever 
went but trained was we played Now the

28:43.913 --> 29:06.042
Philadelphia team was called—it

28:43.913 --> 29:06.042
was right out of Philadelphia, but it finally won 
the team championship. It was named—what was the

29:06.943 --> 29:10.547
name of that team? It was in Philadelphia, but it 
was a serve over in Philadelphia. I'll think about

29:15.115 --> 29:17.578
it in a minute. But we played, and this team was 
coached by Charlie Moran,

29:17.598 --> 29:31.075
who had coached Kendricks at A&M. We played this 
team in Buffalo on a Saturday and then returned the

29:31.095 --> 29:41.207
game in Philadelphia on a Sunday.

29:47.380 --> 29:52.849
And we made the trip, and McKendrick said, now 
boys, we're going to go by first class. We're not

29:53.771 --> 29:56.175
going to ride any Model T's anymore. We're going to 
go by train. So we had 18 players, I think, counting

29:59.200 --> 30:06.132
the two mechanics and everything, going with us. 
And we went down to the station. We were going to

30:09.458 --> 30:12.223
leave that night and ride all night.

30:16.388 --> 30:21.814
got on the train, and he said, well, we haven't got 
the ten tickets for births. This is all true then.

30:26.560 --> 30:30.344
So he said, now all the guys are going to start 
regularly. They're going to have a lower birth,

30:30.384 --> 30:34.008
and the guys are going to be substitutes. They're 
going to be under the birth. So that's the way we

30:37.772 --> 30:40.135
went down to Philadelphia.

30:53.412 --> 31:02.055
So when the season was over,

30:53.412 --> 31:02.055
Jim, he said, well, we'll just play all the way back 
to Texas, which we did.

31:14.489 --> 31:16.073
He was a great Indian player. We played his team 
there twice, once in Oklahoma City and once in Paul

31:16.173 --> 31:21.967
Husky. And then we came on back and played in San 
Antonio and played down, far down.

31:44.510 --> 31:46.812
Kendricks. Kendricks, they fired him up there 
because he, all these cars he brought back, he

31:46.832 --> 31:53.338
wasn't crooked or anything. He just, he thought if 
anything belonged to him, belonged to you,

31:53.378 --> 31:58.643
belonged to him, see. But anyhow, there was some 
kind of mix-up in the management of it. So

32:03.107 --> 32:05.529
Kendricks wasn't hired back the next year.

32:08.352 --> 32:13.757
So,

32:08.352 --> 32:13.757
Alice and myself got together Neil Allison, he 
played here in 24. So we had a phone call. You want to

32:21.560 --> 32:22.541
hear this? Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. It's 
fascinating. Huh? Go ahead. You don't want to put

32:27.387 --> 32:28.548
it in there? Yeah, I do. It's interesting. I don't 
think there's anything like this on record. Go

32:32.212 --> 32:32.613
ahead. So he rang us and said, now listen, I'm going 
back on up there, and it says that Why don't you come

32:43.133 --> 32:44.895
on up here and go with us?" So the Buffalo people had 
sent us our travel expenses. I think it was $60 in

32:50.560 --> 32:52.342
those days. That's a lot of money. So

32:53.423 --> 32:59.528
Neely Allison was living in Denton, Texas. We'd 
been working together all during the summer, and

32:59.548 --> 33:04.393
he'd been living in Denton, Texas. So I went on up to 
Waco, and Jim was living in Waco.

33:12.665 --> 33:24.075
So when I got there, I said, Jim, the first thing he 
said was, I said, let's go down to the express

33:12.665 --> 33:24.075
office and express your baggage to Buffalo. I 
said, I've got the money. I'm going to ride a truck.

33:28.859 --> 33:30.581
He said, oh, don't throw them on the way on trains. I 
said, well, heck, wait. There's freight trains

33:33.203 --> 33:38.028
coming through here today, tonight. He said, 
we'll just ride that freight train. I said, no, I

33:39.729 --> 33:40.630
don't. I said, I got it. Well, he talked me into it, 
so I went down there and I expressed my baggage to

33:42.149 --> 33:53.566
Buffalo, and so that evening I remember the first 
time I'd been at A&M, but I hadn't ridden. I'd been a

33:54.307 --> 33:55.509
freight train rider. So we went out to catch the 
freight train, and it was going up a big hill, and so

33:57.552 --> 34:09.250
we got on there, got on one of these flat cars, I 
mean, where they carry coal, you know. meantime he

34:10.732 --> 34:23.030
had talked, phoned Neely and he was sort of a pretty 
religious boy, I mean very clean morally and

34:10.732 --> 34:23.030
everything else, but of course he was a football 
player. So we got into Fort Worth, we finally got

34:23.050 --> 34:34.967
off the train and we got off this train because we 
had to catch this Sunset, this Texas Special that

34:23.050 --> 34:34.967
went through Denton all the way on up

34:41.005 --> 34:43.268
We finally managed to get off the freight train. 
You know, in those days, they'd pick you up for

34:43.288 --> 34:46.692
riding freight trains. See, they'd pick you up. So 
we finally got off after I stumbled around and fell

34:48.274 --> 34:51.839
over some rails. And so we were riding Neely, and 
Jim did, and told him that we was coming through on

34:51.859 --> 35:04.115
the Texas Special, I think, at a certain, certain 
time leaving Fort Worth. So I said, Jim, well, we

35:04.135 --> 35:06.898
might as well buy a ticket. And he said, no, no. We'd 
get on the back end of this tender.

35:15.583 --> 35:20.468
So we got on the tender and rode into Denton. Of 
course, Neely was down there all dressed up and had

35:21.629 --> 35:25.312
all his baggage and everything.

35:28.475 --> 35:32.679
Jim got off and he was all smutty and dirty, you 
know, cinders and everything. Of course, he had

35:33.480 --> 35:36.443
his mother down there and his girlfriend.

35:40.152 --> 35:42.676
Of course, when he saw Jim, he was horrified.

35:45.801 --> 35:50.868
So Jim came running back before the train was 
pulling out and said, well, I guess we're going to

35:45.801 --> 35:50.868
have to stay all night here. Neely won't get on the 
train with us, so I'll make it short. No, go ahead.

35:55.856 --> 35:56.597
This is a good story. And so he got off. We got off and 
went up and spent the night on the hotel. And so that

36:04.429 --> 36:08.235
morning early, Miss Allison rang in and said,

36:14.273 --> 36:24.126
but this fella Kendrick's can't ride with you 
boys, and we'll let you have the Ford pickup to go on

36:14.273 --> 36:24.126
to providing that Jim gets out of town. See, she was 
mad at Jim, see. So I told Jim, I said, Jim, the best

36:26.650 --> 36:34.020
thing for you to do is leave, although you're going 
with us. He said, well, okay, I'll be seeing you

36:36.203 --> 36:38.867
guys. So we thought he was going on hitched another 
freight train or something along. The next

36:46.221 --> 36:53.148
morning we about, oh it must have been about 10 or 11 
o'clock, Neely came by and we went to the hotel and

36:46.221 --> 36:53.148
picked us up. So we started out and got out of town 
about five miles and there was Kendrick.

37:01.256 --> 37:02.217
So we picked him up. But the worst, the whole thing 
about the story, in those days they had a

37:03.318 --> 37:09.124
two-seater and then they had a rumble seat. You 
call it a rumble seat and you call it a trunk now in

37:10.205 --> 37:12.968
the back. rumble seat all the way to Buffalo. How 
long did it take you to drive? About two and a half,

37:19.535 --> 37:21.158
three days. That's pretty quick. Yeah. Jim went on 
and so he, I don't know whatever happened to him on

37:24.943 --> 37:30.391
that particular deal, but the story all entwined. 
So we went ahead and played that season, but the

37:30.431 --> 37:42.950
middle of the season while we were playing Red 
Grains team there and it come a terrific snowstorm

37:30.431 --> 37:42.950
and the game was canceled. And so...

37:48.368 --> 37:49.269
It didn't amount to much. Can you remember how many 
fans you had at the games? What kind of crowds? Oh,

37:53.594 --> 37:57.899
we had six, seven thousand, four, five, six 
thousand people. Was that a pretty good crowd in

37:58.119 --> 37:59.541
those days? Do you remember what they paid 
admission? If I can remember, of course I think it

38:04.046 --> 38:09.193
was around a dollar, a dollar and a half, two 
dollars. They didn't have much expense. See, in

38:13.037 --> 38:17.262
those days, the headliners made the money like 
grain. Brick Muller and those people like that,

38:17.512 --> 38:23.981
that were all American, they are the ones that drew 
the big money. Just the average. There weren't

38:25.182 --> 38:26.244
many of them. There weren't many of them.

38:31.150 --> 38:40.924
So we went on after this man went on up and joined the 
semi-pro team at Harvard, Connecticut and stayed

38:31.150 --> 38:40.924
there for four or five games. And we had a lot of 
experiences. And then when Alex and Seth started

38:50.553 --> 38:53.396
St. Mary's University was looking for a football 
coach. By chance, they hired Kendricks.

38:59.603 --> 39:01.565
Those were the kind of experiences we had out 
there. So you went to work at St. Mary's then?

39:05.229 --> 39:06.971
Assistant football coach. How long did you stay at 
St. Mary's? Well, Jim didn't last but about six

39:08.873 --> 39:12.737
months.

39:14.800 --> 39:18.464
Oh, he had a great thing. He was a great individual. 
I mean, he was a personal friend of mine, but he

39:20.320 --> 39:32.798
was an adult with a child's mind on some things that 
he did that were out there. I could tell you all

39:32.818 --> 39:40.469
about it, but anyhow, after the football season 
was over, they let him go and made me head football

39:32.818 --> 39:40.469
coach. What kind of coach was Kendricks? He was all 
right. He was a good conditioner. But he was the

39:48.518 --> 39:55.447
type of guy that thought he, he wasn't really 
realistic and sound in his thinking. And all the

39:56.548 --> 40:00.133
football he had learned was under Moran. And we 
used to, after the first year he was out there, we

40:02.076 --> 40:07.543
used to get those boys up and running a mile every 
morning for breakfast. He was a good conditioner,

40:07.563 --> 40:11.127
and he had some good points about him. But he 
wasn't, He wasn't realistic and he didn't have

40:14.978 --> 40:18.882
good judgment on a lot of things. Let me drop back a 
minute and ask you about Bible. We kind of glanced

40:22.086 --> 40:23.387
over him. Well, I expect DX, I think he was the best 
all around. You see, there's different types of

40:33.438 --> 40:37.782
coaches. There's a

40:51.918 --> 40:53.240
loved him and believed in him. And then there's a 
type of coach that was just flamboyant, you might

40:54.442 --> 41:00.693
say, just didn't have anything. But Bible was a, he 
was, see, DX came to A&M

41:00.713 --> 41:09.508
as a coach. He started his coaching career as a 
player.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.174
Mississippi College. And then he brought Frank 
over here when he came here in 1916 or 17. But D.X.

41:26.450 --> 41:30.480
was a, was my type of coach. He wasn't a bear, but

41:44.770 --> 41:47.672
gave the rules and regulations, you better not 
break them. And then there's the fellow down here

41:48.013 --> 41:54.698
that is more or less a fatherly coach that you 
respected and put out for. And our Bible was a great

41:55.159 --> 42:01.024
coach during that time. And he was a gentleman 
coach. A gentleman coach, that's what I would call

42:02.205 --> 42:04.707
him. A gentleman coach. Gained your respect 
easily. I don't know of anybody that played at A&M

42:07.009 --> 42:14.575
that didn't respect and love the X, without a 
doubt. Then how long were you head coach now at St.

42:15.719 --> 42:18.023
Mary's? I coached there in 28, 29, 30, and 31. Do you 
remember anything about that? Yes, I had very good

42:27.257 --> 42:29.059
luck there. I coached everything at that time. 
Basketball, baseball, and football.

42:44.558 --> 42:54.274
a season by playing DePaul University in Chicago

42:44.558 --> 42:54.274
in the Soldiers Field. And what I remember about 
that was that Notre Dame, we played on Sunday. I'm

43:00.444 --> 43:01.285
not a Catholic.

43:12.908 --> 43:21.577
We went up there, and the thing I remember about 
that was Notre Dame and Southern Cal was playing on

43:12.908 --> 43:21.577
Saturday at Soldiers Field. Although I had 
practiced my team, my wife and some of the brothers

43:21.597 --> 43:28.344
and some of the other people who went along with the 
team saw that game. I think they had the biggest

43:28.384 --> 43:31.788
crowd they ever had, 120,000 people. And that's 
when— Tremendous in those days. Yeah. And that was

43:36.132 --> 43:40.997
when Rockne, you know, if you don't remember, but 
he had been sick. I know who he was.

43:49.105 --> 43:57.053
We went up on a train and came back on a train. Did you 
play at mainly other church schools then? No, we

44:01.478 --> 44:14.472
played Sam Houston Teachers, and we played Texas 
A&I, and we played St. Edward's, and we played

44:01.478 --> 44:14.472
DePaul University, Schreiner Institute, which 
was a big

44:17.928 --> 44:23.196
most of the state schools, Sol Ross, teams like 
that. Well, the second year we had a good team, and

44:23.216 --> 44:26.821
the third year the Depression hit us. And the 
brothers called me in one day and said, well, I'm

44:28.604 --> 44:43.345
sure, I hate to show, but

44:28.604 --> 44:43.345
we've got notice from the authorities in St. 
Louis, see their head school was in, I don't know

44:44.354 --> 44:51.304
what you call them, the school was in St. Louis, and 
that they had to dispose of football on account of

44:44.354 --> 44:51.304
the economy move. So they had to let you go there? 
Well, yeah. They stopped all sports? All sports.

44:58.594 --> 45:03.702
And they never did continue on until way back in the 
late 40s when they started back again. I see. Let me

45:05.224 --> 45:07.127
stop a minute and turn my tape over. I'm about to run 
out on one side.
