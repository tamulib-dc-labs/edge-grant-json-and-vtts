WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:04.149
That's right. How many years, how far back did that 
go? Did he have that place for years? For years. I

00:12.319 --> 00:14.602
mean, yeah. And there were some more of them. They 
were kin somehow to the ones that owned the

00:19.348 --> 00:26.296
property for South Oakwood. Describe Mr. 
Herdlicka. Herdlicka? Yes, sir. Uh... I know I

00:33.983 --> 00:36.185
couldn't do that. I know I wouldn't know a man if I 
saw him again. Only time I had any real,

00:42.833 --> 00:50.602
we always had two cows. Either when we were on the 
campus or when we were in College Park, we had two

00:52.604 --> 00:57.870
cows. And so it was my job to, to take them and get 
them bred. And the hard licker had a small Jersey

01:08.044 --> 01:12.430
bull. So I'd have to go over there to him. And that 
was quite a circus. Did you, were the cattle, did

01:22.244 --> 01:25.989
you have those heifers here on the campus? Those 
milk cows? Yeah, we used them. We sold the

01:33.552 --> 01:39.018
offsprings that we got, but we kept one. 
Originally, when we were up on the campus, the

01:41.761 --> 01:52.133
college decided that they were going to upgrade 
their dairy herd. And they had one of these big old

01:53.414 --> 01:59.661
jerseys that was He's supposedly a 15th, 16th 
Jersey. They couldn't get the papers on her, so

02:07.272 --> 02:10.395
they sold her. Dad bought her. He took her down 
there to the end of Quality Road, and we had a place

02:12.757 --> 02:18.423
for her. Because the etymology

02:19.124 --> 02:29.614
had a whole bunch of farms in there. a number of 
places we could keep cattle. And so we kept that one

02:36.124 --> 02:43.094
and then we got an offspring off of it and that's why 
we got two of them. When we came down to, when we

02:43.114 --> 03:00.478
moved down from 1924

02:43.114 --> 03:00.478
we moved from the college to

03:02.467 --> 03:03.929
College Park. Now, you said 24. You didn't mean... 
Yeah. I thought you moved to College Station in 24.

03:08.276 --> 03:08.536
No, 19. 19. Oh, okay. I lived there five years. When 
you all lived on the campus, did your mother have a

03:15.526 --> 03:18.390
maid? No. Did anybody help her with house 
cleaning?

03:27.404 --> 03:28.305
We had...

03:31.964 --> 03:37.332
I don't remember we, oh yeah, yeah.

03:41.458 --> 03:51.693
You had, you could get students to come help when 
you were running the laundry.

03:54.337 --> 04:00.807
You had to go outside and you had a cast iron pot with 
Full of water and soap and all that stuff. And one

04:06.952 --> 04:12.459
man that I remember was named Scott. He later 
became engineers around here for a lot of things. I

04:19.108 --> 04:22.713
think he one time or another was chief engineer for 
the city of Brown. But he came down there for 25

04:23.774 --> 04:30.203
cents an hour at 6 o'clock in the morning or For a 
long time. To help with the washing? Yeah, they

04:34.252 --> 04:40.240
took it outside and washed the clothes. And yeah, 
there were some Negroes in that particular

04:40.560 --> 04:46.087
operation. And there were clotheslines all 
across the neighborhood. They had clotheslines,

04:50.012 --> 04:51.514
yeah. But you had to heat everything with wood. 
Mm-hmm. You had no gas. And where did you all get the

04:57.286 --> 04:58.527
wood? Did you buy it from? You bought people to 
come. Our contingency of wood was 15 cords of wood.

05:12.340 --> 05:18.266
Now, a cord of wood is 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 4 
feet high. And you had to bring it. They had to bring

05:20.528 --> 05:21.789
them in there. They were cut with an axe. And it was 
most all oak? Old oak. That's the reason we could

05:29.022 --> 05:33.368
never have a bonfire. Sure. The bonfire we made, we 
kept the crating. Sure. Everything in the

05:39.516 --> 05:46.766
business was shipped with crating on it. We didn't 
have pasteboards like we have today. Sure. I'm

05:52.246 --> 05:54.589
trying to think about campus personalities. Do 
you remember Coach D.X. Bible? Oh, yeah. Describe

05:58.533 --> 05:59.394
him. He was a pretty good-sized man. Did he live on 
campus? Oh, yeah. He had a house on campus. And his

06:08.023 --> 06:09.585
teams were good. Was he well-liked? He had the best 
there was. And he went to the university, but

06:14.070 --> 06:19.075
that's what kind of tore it with us. Now... He 
left... But I remember those games when they had

06:21.338 --> 06:27.747
Joel Hunt. Yep.

06:33.234 --> 06:45.031
He'd take that line and he'd take that line and he'd 
open a hole you could drive a damn car

06:33.234 --> 06:45.031
through. Sitting up on the end where we always did 
it on the end of the stadiums or something, you

06:45.051 --> 06:50.518
know. and you could see right where he was going to 
run. It was pitiful. Now, he brought young Andy

07:00.199 --> 07:05.406
Anderson with him, didn't he, as an assistant 
coach? I don't know anything about that. You

07:07.068 --> 07:08.189
remember Colonel Andy. I know, I know, I know. But 
the only occasion that I ever had with Colonel Andy

07:10.752 --> 07:21.045
was at...

07:21.616 --> 07:23.558
When I had to take P.E. and I couldn't run, and so he 
got me to take the trotter. I trotted on the, around

07:31.828 --> 07:36.214
their track. And I just trotted along the best I 
could. When, there's Colonel Andy's son, Rusty,

07:41.940 --> 07:48.248
the doctor here. He told me what his father had told 
him about the 12th man game in Dallas. Do you

07:57.145 --> 07:59.347
remember hearing anything about it then? Did 
people talk about the 12th man immediately after

07:59.407 --> 08:04.272
it happened? No, it's something they have brought 
up.

08:13.601 --> 08:18.606
They never did

08:13.601 --> 08:18.606
say too much about it. Did you by chance know Heine 
Weir, the football player? He later was dean out at

08:23.062 --> 08:27.407
Schreiner Institute in Kerrville. He's the one 
whose hurt knee might have kept him from playing

08:28.087 --> 08:37.418
and why they got King Gill to come down and put his 
uniform on. Oh. Well, I don't know. When you were a

08:42.765 --> 08:45.528
little boy, did you all go to the football games? 
Yeah, we did the football games. Matter of fact, I

08:48.455 --> 09:05.015
have some movies of a rice game in which

08:48.455 --> 09:05.015
Jaron Johnson, I got a lot of pictures of him in 
movies. He'd get up on a, see, they did a Jar and

09:14.375 --> 09:21.904
John, they'd pull him right up behind the tackle, 
right there. And so when they snapped the ball,

09:23.426 --> 09:27.912
they just gave it to him. And he would get out there 
and he'd say to some of the guys in front of

09:29.574 --> 09:41.749
him, I'm... I'm coming through here. He would tell 
them that, oh, some of the other guys would say, oh,

09:46.195 --> 09:56.164
John's going through here.

10:01.829 --> 10:04.992
So that, it was just hype, you know. But he did, it 
was a short change. That's what that coach

10:10.717 --> 10:12.158
brought. When you were a little kid, did you and 
your buddies go hunting or fishing? We did

10:17.632 --> 10:18.413
fishing. Where did you fish? In that lake there in 
front of my house.

10:24.981 --> 10:26.543
Yeah. What we called nigger fishing. Now, you're 
talking about on campus or? No, around College

10:30.909 --> 10:32.591
Park. College Park, uh-huh. There was a big lake in 
there. Oh, okay. Gilchrist made us cut it open.

10:39.599 --> 10:42.803
Because we didn't have a herd...

10:45.044 --> 10:45.665
A permit? A health permit. Oh, okay. Well, when he 
was built, there wasn't any health permits. Sure.

10:51.613 --> 10:51.933
Sure. He was just bound to determine they were 
going to... Dad kept that thing full of what he

10:53.055 --> 11:03.548
called

10:53.055 --> 11:03.548
minerals.

11:06.552 --> 11:12.861
We had a whole sewer system in there, and I had to 
take part in that. I had to... get help to do that.

11:16.849 --> 11:20.634
Had a little bigger sand work with them. I took care 
of that. They had some down on the south end of

11:22.938 --> 11:31.071
Dexter there across the creek there. They had that 
thing there and I helped lay that along the line

11:31.111 --> 11:36.880
from our house down there. Allison was the, dad had 
a A man named Allison. He was a World War I man. He'd

11:48.333 --> 11:49.254
been shot at. Shot up, too. He parachuted out and 
they shot him. And he survived. And he was around

11:59.588 --> 12:02.271
there and taught classes. See, Dad had to 
reconstitute that organization there. He had

12:12.423 --> 12:13.424
three men. The whole department, three? Josh 
Carney and one of the Whitleys. He sold cars later.

12:28.941 --> 12:29.582
He was there. And another man, I don't know his 
name. Who do you think would have been your dad's

12:33.346 --> 12:38.832
favorite dean of agriculture of all the people he 
worked with? Dean Kyle. Dean Kyle? Now he served

12:43.591 --> 12:45.273
till about when? 39 he died. So he was dean a long 
time. Well, my father died in 39. Oh, oh. And Dean

12:54.323 --> 13:02.451
Pratt was still head of the... Dad was assistant 
dean. Okay. What were his duties as assistant

13:03.292 --> 13:05.314
dean? Oh, he had to counsel students and and all the 
time, and then you had to work on your curriculum,

13:11.992 --> 13:19.780
the ag engineering. Where was his office as 
assistant dean?

13:27.327 --> 13:28.068
I don't know. I can't tell you that, but I do know if 
you go out there in the front of that white

13:29.409 --> 13:39.619
building, the administrative building, on the 
base of that flagpole, you'll find his name.

13:45.973 --> 13:48.356
Do you remember when that building was 
constructed? Yes. Describe that as much as you

13:49.037 --> 13:51.099
can. It cost $400,000. And that's the early 30s? 
Well, you see, what happened was this. They

14:00.630 --> 14:07.918
came along First, let's go back a little further. 
The legislature set up a building fund for these

14:12.970 --> 14:22.178
advanced colleges in there. And originally, and 
they took and gave all of the,

14:23.840 --> 14:35.011
well, in case, oh, that would be your- The 
permanent fund? Yeah, permanent fund. They made a

14:37.453 --> 14:38.614
permanent fund. But they gave them, in the case of 
over in East Texas, they gave them all the lumber.

14:46.009 --> 14:56.564
And then the legislature, in all of its wisdom, 
decided that they wanted to change it. So what did

14:58.106 --> 14:59.047
they do? They took it out of East Texas, and they 
went out here to where this county that over here in

15:05.628 --> 15:15.540
Texas, where it comes down to that square point, 
comes down here and goes to El Paso, that little

15:05.628 --> 15:15.540
county right there. And they gave them the rights 
to a whole bunch of this stuff in here. The mineral

15:22.708 --> 15:23.469
rights. And for the lumber of it. Okay, well, they 
discovered oil out there. In its heyday, That oil

15:35.598 --> 15:41.766
produced 37% of all the oil produced in the North 
American continent.

15:44.830 --> 15:45.812
That one county.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.824
So that's where we got the money. We can't spend it 
for the permanent

16:03.526 --> 16:33.499
bond

16:03.526 --> 16:33.499
the interest well they did that and they gave the 
university six million dollars well so A&M

16:03.526 --> 16:33.499
decided we ought to have part of that too so we sued 
them we sued them and they divided it up two-thirds

16:34.323 --> 16:38.448
for us and one-third for us. That's where we got the 
money to build all these buildings that we had over

16:38.468 --> 16:42.934
here. And then another thing happened, I don't 
know how they handled that, but later on when I was

16:44.797 --> 17:02.440
teaching in 35, the

16:44.797 --> 17:02.440
state was broke. Paid with warrants.

17:06.943 --> 17:11.368
Because your check, if you cashed it immediately, 
it was discounted, wasn't it? One and a half

17:12.149 --> 17:16.614
percent.

17:16.634 --> 17:24.103
I got $150 a month for teaching

17:16.634 --> 17:24.103
at Tarleton. Now, let's go back to the big 
administration building. Whose idea was it to

17:33.672 --> 17:40.100
turn the campus around and extend it to the east? 
Well, you

17:40.761 --> 17:58.182
built that concrete

17:40.761 --> 17:58.182
two-lane highway from the bridge all the way to 
Texas Avenue.

18:00.044 --> 18:03.308
What is now Texas Avenue. And so it was part of that? 
Yes, part of that. It came through here and this

18:09.127 --> 18:18.737
thing was all, they built that in 33 or 34. What did, 
those of you living here, what did you all think

18:20.098 --> 18:24.763
about the change to the campus? Did you all like it 
or not? Oh yeah, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it, but it

18:28.988 --> 18:30.409
just,

18:34.490 --> 18:43.800
The only thing I don't like about the campus is 
these architects and landscape people want to put

18:34.490 --> 18:43.800
humps in it. Yeah. They don't want you to look at 
anything. When it was here, it was a flat piece of

18:49.366 --> 18:55.253
ground, and you could just travel all over the way 
you wanted to. That's

18:55.293 --> 19:00.278
the only thing I would object to. As they were 
building those new buildings in the early 30s, did

19:00.663 --> 19:09.252
most of those materials come on the train? No.

19:12.836 --> 19:13.076
No. They came by truck. Yeah. You had a

19:18.062 --> 19:25.630
funny thing happen there on trucking. The 
railroads got a thing through the legislature

19:28.810 --> 19:47.693
that you couldn't haul more than a ton and a half 
past a depot.

19:50.617 --> 19:58.446
If you hauled more than a ton and a half past a depot, 
you had to put it on the railroad right there. and so

19:59.506 --> 20:26.982
but uh we had enough good at 30 and 34 we had enough 
good trucks and there were some pretty good sized

19:59.506 --> 20:26.982
ones on the market so we we could haul stuff but uh 
most of the gravel and the sand that came from here

19:59.506 --> 20:26.982
was taken out of out

20:28.582 --> 20:39.056
of some places around here that no longer exist.

20:41.760 --> 20:54.117
The one that built that highway is, you go down 
there beyond where the speedway is, and there's a

20:41.760 --> 20:54.117
road down in that flat there. Well, it all came out 
of that right there, but it went clean to the river,

20:54.586 --> 21:00.932
I think. There was some place back in there. And 
they were trying to use, they had a bunch of

21:04.776 --> 21:16.488
Chevrolet trucks and the Ford V8 trucks. And the 
Ford V8 trucks were just one out. because you could

21:23.290 --> 21:37.548
throw that old Ford V8 in the grandma and come out of 
that quarter with it just loping along all the way

21:23.290 --> 21:37.548
in. And those engines lasted. Where the Chevrolet 
truck was, you had to grind it out. And it just, you

21:44.797 --> 21:49.062
know, wide open. And they wouldn't last. So the 
Ford was the better? The better truck that won out

21:52.837 --> 21:57.464
in that battle. All the way from Navasota to up 
here. And I remember driving a,

22:04.213 --> 22:16.090
I don't know, that was a 34 or 36 probably. My mother 
said she had to go to town real quick. She was

22:19.282 --> 22:21.205
supposed to be there a certain time. I turned down 
on that thing, and we were turning 85. And as a kid,

22:26.572 --> 22:36.385
we used to go north of Bryan, and I'd run up there 
many a night with kids. We were running wide open,

22:37.226 --> 22:47.820
about 85 miles an hour, neck and neck, on a brand new 
piece of concrete.

22:48.745 --> 22:50.968
With lots of fun. You're mentioning about the sand 
and gravel. Many old Aggies have mentioned about

22:53.732 --> 22:58.219
going out to the clay pits. Now the clay pits are a 
different situation. Now that was, but south and

23:02.725 --> 23:05.429
west? No, it's off of the old Wellborn Road. Well, 
it's all the road that goes into, beyond Wellborn

23:10.416 --> 23:18.668
and goes into the, you can drive it today. goes 
right down there, and it turns and goes into

23:19.036 --> 23:22.901
Highway 6. Yeah. Yeah, you know what that is. Yes, 
sir. All right, well,

23:26.645 --> 23:32.393
there was some formations in there. They're still 
there. And they used to take the railroads and take

23:34.976 --> 23:44.207
carloads of cars, big cars, and stick them down 
there. I don't know. I think they were not. open

23:48.820 --> 23:50.682
cars, they were closed. But anyways, that 
particular stuff that was in the ground was used as

23:53.004 --> 24:04.476
a filler for some sort of a situation. And it's 
known that way. You can put a liquid through it and

24:07.959 --> 24:13.725
fill it out. When you were a youngster, had that 
Yeah, they were there. They were already there?

24:19.862 --> 24:26.071
And the nice thing about it was you could go 
swimming in it. All right, that's what, did you

24:26.131 --> 24:29.817
ever go down, go swimming there? I never was 
swimming in it. But I've been there and looked at

24:32.241 --> 24:33.763
it. I mean, looked at it. And it's a real, real place 
to swim in. Only place I ever saw around here was

24:38.690 --> 24:46.502
that the water would be nice and clean and slightly 
bluish. stuff like that. When you were in high

24:49.672 --> 24:57.419
school or an undergraduate here, where could and 
where could y'all go swimming?

25:00.662 --> 25:01.543
Wasn't a swimming pool. Yeah, it wasn't. You 
didn't go swimming in the river, did you? No, we

25:08.729 --> 25:11.131
didn't go swimming in that river. That's what I... 
We got sick over there. Yeah. And the other thing,

25:17.212 --> 25:18.894
I'll tell you why I didn't. There was a little bit of 
a, before we built the lake in College Park, while I

25:20.055 --> 25:38.036
was still living up on the campus, there was a 
smaller lake between that and the college

25:20.055 --> 25:38.036
property. A little small lake in there. And a kid 
named Hayes who lived across the street from us, we

25:41.950 --> 25:55.529
went swimming down

25:41.950 --> 25:55.529
there. He was a pretty good-sized kid. And I got to 
meet him in my lifetime. We'd be swimming in that

26:03.901 --> 26:07.907
thing anymore. Did you and your buddies have dogs, 
cats, other pets when you lived on campus? Oh yeah,

26:13.172 --> 26:16.577
all kinds of stuff like that. I even had a goat.

26:28.373 --> 26:31.617
I don't know where the

26:33.993 --> 27:01.688
what the drill field is now the south drill field 
and the core area well there used to be some people

26:33.993 --> 27:01.688
in there and I don't know exactly what they were 
doing and they had some goats in there and one of the

26:33.993 --> 27:01.688
men had some goats and he had one of them and he 
couldn't feed it So I didn't have the time to feed

27:02.579 --> 27:04.642
it. Somehow or another it was, so he knew me and we 
had been talking about that goat and stuff and the

27:05.704 --> 27:21.026
goats in there. So he brought me that thing and told 
me, showed me how to feed it. He said, you can, will

27:26.494 --> 27:30.780
you do this? And when I get ready, I'll buy it back 
from them. Well, the trouble was they couldn't buy

27:37.814 --> 27:45.603
it back because it had become a pet. It followed 
anybody everywhere. Oh, really? On the campus?

27:54.833 --> 27:56.856
Well, all around that property. That's what I 
mean. Wherever the men were going, it went. So I had

28:01.372 --> 28:03.314
to take it back. I think they paid me for it. I don't 
remember what happened with it. Did you and your

28:10.602 --> 28:18.950
junior high, when you were a kid, did you and your 
buddies ever do any pranks, jokes? Well, you see,

28:18.970 --> 28:30.923
one of the things is I went to A&M Consolidated 
School until I got through the first...

28:35.341 --> 28:36.763
Eight or nine grades. And those were on campus 
here. They were in that old white building, what

28:39.806 --> 28:47.254
they call a music hall, I think now. And my mother,

28:47.274 --> 28:55.903
she decided she wanted to run for the school board.

28:58.846 --> 29:03.711
And so what happened was she ran. And all those men 
down through there, all that company down through

29:05.294 --> 29:14.647
there, we don't want no woman on the school board. 
We don't want no woman on the school board. So they

29:17.331 --> 29:19.674
got all the men up. And she lost her election. Well, 
we found out, and she, I don't know how we found out

29:32.311 --> 29:35.635
all this stuff.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.242
I'm sure dad had a lot to do with it too. And so they 
decided that they filed a state law that said if you

29:43.724 --> 29:59.382
did not have a high school in your particular 
district, you could transfer anywhere in Texas.

30:02.213 --> 30:03.916
So they transferred me to Bryan. 1929.

30:08.143 --> 30:11.228
No, 31.

30:12.570 --> 30:15.134
And where was Bryan High School located then? It 
was just off of 29th Street now. It's from that big

30:21.385 --> 30:23.889
building they tore down. Okay. So I went to see. No, 
twenty-nine. I went thirty, thirty-one. And

30:34.862 --> 30:38.747
about how many were in your graduating class?

30:41.630 --> 30:42.992
Pretty good bunch. I would imagine several 
hundred. It was quite a big school. Describe being

30:51.081 --> 30:53.423
a student at Bryan High then. Bryan High? What was 
it like? They had what I did all the time. They had

31:03.608 --> 31:06.571
what you call a manual training. And they had a 
fellow named Smith who ran it. And he got you in

31:14.239 --> 31:21.466
there and he was training you to build furniture. I 
built one. I've got a

31:31.128 --> 31:32.610
Bookcase? No.

31:38.657 --> 31:39.398
Cedar line?

31:43.122 --> 31:43.603
Closet? No. It's just a big old cedar line box with 
long legs. Oh, I see.
