WEBVTT

00:03.052 --> 00:11.583
I believe we've already mentioned a little bit 
about the athletes having the privilege of the

00:03.052 --> 00:11.583
training table. Were there any other assets to 
being an athlete? Well, I can't say, Charles, that

00:18.953 --> 00:23.579
I didn't letter to A&M. I lettered on the freshman 
team, but we played with the varsity in baseball

00:23.800 --> 00:32.451
and basketball, and we didn't get a letter as such. 
And I was a pitcher, and I never did get a letter on

00:32.903 --> 00:39.310
the varsity. But I stayed on the squad a great deal 
of the time. I don't think I can be classified as an

00:45.716 --> 00:49.180
athlete. I tried. But since you were on the squad, 
you were eligible for the training table for the

00:49.921 --> 00:56.087
whole time. That's right. But you still had to do 
all your drills and wear your uniform and

00:57.524 --> 01:03.533
regulation. I presume that if there was a drill 
scheduled while you were supposed to be

01:03.793 --> 01:13.367
practicing, you would be excused from the drill. 
That's right. In checking through the yearbook

01:14.288 --> 01:27.227
during your senior year,

01:14.288 --> 01:27.227
I had an indication there that you were president 
of something called the NTAC Club. That's the

01:27.460 --> 01:32.387
North Texas

01:27.460 --> 01:32.387
Cultural College. That was Grubbs, that's the old 
Grubbs Vocational College that I entered in 1916

01:33.108 --> 01:40.799
to get in the uniform. My family sent me up there so I 
wouldn't go into the army. I had a brother in

01:44.564 --> 01:50.953
service and they didn't want two of us in service 
and I was settled to go at 16 anyway. But that's what

01:51.457 --> 01:55.223
that was, North Texas Agricultural College. And 
it's now University of Texas in Arlington, as you

01:55.243 --> 01:59.069
well know. So this would be an organization of all 
the boys who had been through that particular

01:59.089 --> 02:04.777
school prior to coming to A&M. That is correct. 
Okay.

02:11.348 --> 02:16.215
You were also on the staff of the Fish Battalion in 
1920. I know there was a time period of years where

02:16.516 --> 02:27.872
they had a magazine for each class and some special 
events. Was this that particular issue? That was

02:30.856 --> 02:32.558
that particular issue. We had the opportunity, 
the freshman class had the privilege of

02:32.618 --> 02:40.990
publishing the battalion one time. And that's 
when I was on the editorial staff. In fact, I still

02:44.275 --> 02:46.017
have that battalion. It's quite something. We 
have most of those that were in magazine format.

02:53.383 --> 02:55.065
Yes, that's what that was. I think you were also a 
member of an organization called

02:57.209 --> 03:02.878
One-Buttoneers.

03:04.901 --> 03:08.967
I was, and that was the brave second lieutenants. 
And we, I don't know whether it's through sheer

03:10.567 --> 03:18.319
embarrassment by being a second lieutenant or 
just because we wanted to have some fun, so we

03:10.567 --> 03:18.319
organized. And we had several dances, the one 
known as the One-Button Ears. And we just had a

03:24.830 --> 03:28.776
great time as second lieutenants on the campus. 
And I don't know whether all the boys belonged to

03:28.796 --> 03:35.747
the One-Button Ears or not, but anyway, it was a fun 
thing. So that was kind of a social organization.

03:38.548 --> 03:41.153
It was, and as I mentioned, we had some dances. So 
this would be a contribution to the social life of

03:42.275 --> 03:45.881
the campus. That's right. And were the dances just 
for the members of the club or not open to the rest of

03:46.863 --> 03:52.112
them? That's right. And you were also in the RVs. 
Was that for one year or for two?

04:00.196 --> 04:08.385
I was in the RVs two years, two years, because I 
couldn't have been voted in my first year because I

04:00.196 --> 04:08.385
was a freshman. And I was in the RVs my junior and 
senior year. You said you were voted in. Yes. Was

04:15.494 --> 04:17.456
that still where somebody recommended you? 
That's right. And everybody voted? I understand

04:19.739 --> 04:24.884
it was a no blackball thing. If you were one 
blackball, you didn't get in. It was a military and

04:27.507 --> 04:29.470
social organization. Uh-huh. Did that require a 
fair amount more drill practice? We did drill

04:35.713 --> 04:38.677
quite a bit, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We had 
the white uniforms they have today, quite a bit of

04:38.697 --> 04:42.641
gold braid. I'm sure you've seen those pictures. 
Did you participate in any special drills or

04:45.965 --> 04:50.350
special exhibitions? No, we didn't, except on the 
campus.

04:57.807 --> 05:00.450
didn't go off campus as the way the RVs do today. No, 
not, I believe they go to New Orleans. They go to New

05:02.933 --> 05:06.897
Orleans, I think they were at the opening of the 
Constitutional Convention. That's right, and

05:06.917 --> 05:11.022
they also are at the governor's inauguration. 
That's right, we didn't do that. Okay, and when you

05:14.826 --> 05:24.017
graduated in the spring of 24, did you have a job 
lined up Before graduation, or did you have to hunt

05:24.402 --> 05:26.785
one? No, in 1924, during that period, for three or 
four or five years, there were many

05:27.106 --> 05:35.437
opportunities. Our economic conditions were 
good, and I think most anyone who graduated from

05:35.837 --> 05:43.307
college or university could get jobs. And I had two 
or three or four job offers. And I did go with

05:48.214 --> 05:51.979
Ralston Purina, which I haven't regretted. and 
was with Ralston Purina 42 years and thoroughly

05:52.803 --> 06:00.795
enjoyed it and I had a fair degree of success.

06:05.201 --> 06:07.705
I believe you began as a salesman in St. Louis. 
That's right. That's where we trained and I came to

06:08.746 --> 06:14.895
Texas to do some extra training. and was given a 
territory or a district in the Rio Grande Valley of

06:15.938 --> 06:23.527
Texas, which was at that time just beginning, just 
developing. Now, as a salesman for Ross and

06:23.887 --> 06:30.434
Purina, you didn't sell to individuals, did you? 
You would sell to distributors? Well, we sold to

06:32.136 --> 06:39.364
distributors, but we also called on ranchers and 
large feeders. That was part of our training

06:40.626 --> 06:44.410
program, and the salesmen still do that. So 
actually you sold both to individuals and to

06:44.913 --> 06:47.896
dealers. That's right. Distributors. That's 
right. You had each salesman would have a

06:50.659 --> 06:55.263
specified territory to cover. That's right. 
That's right. And then ultimately you became what

06:58.426 --> 07:02.871
manager? Well, I became sales manager. I was in the 
Red Grande Valley 15 years as salesman. District

07:08.636 --> 07:11.059
salesman had 27 dealers there. And came

07:14.191 --> 07:26.889
out here, we came to Lubbock in 1940 as sales 
manager for this West Texas, part of New Mexico and

07:14.191 --> 07:26.889
part of Oklahoma area. And then in 1945, I went into 
our plant, which is in Lubbock, as manager of that

07:27.830 --> 07:38.806
plant, and stayed until I retired in 1966 as plant 
manager. And this is the production of the... Of

07:38.826 --> 07:42.291
the chows, our... the feed. Is that, how does the 
plant here in Lubbock say compared to other plants

07:46.423 --> 07:54.296
across the arena for production? We have some 
plants that are larger but this is one of the very

07:54.957 --> 08:08.500
fine plants in the United States and one of the 
profitable plants on the basis of quite a volume.

08:08.520 --> 08:08.700
It's You have a lot of livestock in the community to 
consume. Yes, we do. We surely have. Commodities,

08:13.559 --> 08:18.525
as opposed to perhaps more than, say, St. Louis, 
the headquarters? It's the headquarters and the

08:18.545 --> 08:21.348
home office. Ralston Pure Rain is about 78 years 
old. It was established about 78 years ago. It's

08:30.139 --> 08:35.746
one of the largest feed plants in the world. It is 
the largest. And we're doing business all over the

08:38.178 --> 08:45.891
world in many

08:38.178 --> 08:45.891
other parts of the business. We're in the tuna fish 
business, chicken of the sea tuna. That's the

08:49.516 --> 08:50.318
largest. We are the largest in the tuna fish 
business in the world. That's a subsidiary of

08:54.444 --> 08:56.147
Ralston? A subsidiary of Ralston Purina. We have 
several subsidiaries. We have a serial

08:59.653 --> 09:02.297
subsidiary. And Purina Dog Chows. We have 11 
plants in the United States. Any plants abroad? We

09:11.053 --> 09:11.493
do. We have plants in Europe, and we have plants in 
South America, and we have plants in Mexico. I

09:19.965 --> 09:26.974
visited some plants in South America last summer, 
in Peru, and also in Brazil. I believe you said you

09:29.197 --> 09:34.204
were with Ralston for 42 years. Yes. So you retired 
then in 1966.

09:42.235 --> 09:44.757
And what have you been doing since then?

09:46.619 --> 09:49.683
I'm a director in the Lubbock Savings and Loan 
Association. A group of us organized that

09:49.703 --> 09:52.826
association in 1952.

09:55.830 --> 10:04.800
And I was a director then, and I continue to be a 
director, and have a desk in one of the branches. I

10:05.084 --> 10:13.458
guess my responsibility, Charles, would be 
public relations, which I enjoy. And I thoroughly

10:13.578 --> 10:20.670
enjoy having been associated with that 
organization since 52. I really appreciate it.

10:23.936 --> 10:27.823
And I have a feeling of responsibility. We all need 
that. Now, I believe a little bit ago you indicated

10:31.139 --> 10:40.590
that you had jotted down some notes, some things 
that you wanted to sort of make sure we covered.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.152
Well, not necessarily, Charles. I just wanted to 
be sure. If you were going to run short of time, I was

10:44.414 --> 10:51.402
just going to hand this to you, and I didn't know you 
were going to tape this conversation. I didn't

10:52.303 --> 10:57.009
know how it was going to be, but I just happened to, I 
did that after I learned that you weren't going to

10:52.303 --> 10:57.009
be here. Did you have some things on there that we 
haven't covered here? Uh...

11:14.592 --> 11:24.083
Well, I think we've covered almost everything 
except what I've done, if that be of any interest,

11:14.592 --> 11:24.083
as a citizen of Lubbock. That would be of interest, 
yes. It would be of interest. Well, there's one

11:27.868 --> 11:30.771
thing that I'm real proud of that I didn't mention. 
When I was in Rio Grande Valley, I was awarded the

11:32.553 --> 11:44.447
William Sample Award, which is an outstanding 
salesmanship award, and I believe there's only

11:32.553 --> 11:44.447
been 125 given In our period of time that William H. 
Sample was sales manager of our company, national

11:45.760 --> 11:56.650
sales manager of our company. And we had, through 
the period of time, we've had about 5,000

11:56.670 --> 12:02.155
salesmen. And I am very proud of that. And my 
district in the Rio Grande Valley was considered

12:03.716 --> 12:10.002
the finest district in Ralston Peel Rain Company. 
That might sound a little egotistical. But there

12:13.975 --> 12:15.677
are a lot of districts in the United States. There 
are a lot of districts in the United States. We

12:17.218 --> 12:18.819
cover the entire country. And that was from 1925 to 
1940. And then I went into, I became sales manager.

12:27.527 --> 12:41.099
Those

12:27.527 --> 12:41.099
are some of the things I've done in Lubbock. Would 
you like to have some of those? civic activities.

12:53.491 --> 12:59.376
In 1953 I was elected President of the Lubbock 
Chamber of Commerce and I thoroughly enjoyed

12:53.491 --> 12:59.376
that. It was at the time when Lubbock was really 
beginning to grow and I appreciated being a part of

12:59.556 --> 13:06.923
that. And in 1956 was elected director of the 
Lubbock County Water and Improvement District

13:12.194 --> 13:34.472
which is known as Buffalo Lakes it was a million 
eight hundred thousand dollar project and it was a

13:12.194 --> 13:34.472
countywide election and I was chairman of that 
chairman of the board of that the

13:12.194 --> 13:34.472
of that district and In 1956, I resigned from the 
Lubbock County Water and Improvement District to

13:35.077 --> 13:49.816
run for a place on the City Commission, which I did, 
was elected in 1956 to the City Council. Served one

13:49.837 --> 13:50.758
term. And in 1952, we organized Lubbock Savings 
and Loan Association. I had mentioned that a

13:57.627 --> 14:02.333
minute or two ago, and we're still going. And I did 
serve as chairman of the Red Cross Financial Drive

14:04.237 --> 14:15.027
in Lubbock County and the chairman of the National 
Foundation of Incentive Paralysis for Lubbock

14:04.237 --> 14:15.027
County. That was before the Salk vaccine was 
developed. And we had sent many boys and girls to

14:18.790 --> 14:28.279
Shrine and Cripple Children's Hospital in 
Scottish Rite. And I was nominated to the Honorary

14:34.865 --> 14:50.925
State Farmer of the FFA at a state meeting in 
Lubbock about four years ago, and Senator Charles

14:34.865 --> 14:50.925
Verner, president of this bank, and I were on that 
committee, and we were honored in that way. And I

14:52.447 --> 14:58.214
was president of the West Texas Museum 
Association when it was elected in October 1960.

14:59.876 --> 15:03.100
And that has gotten to be one of the real fine 
museums in the country. And that is where? In

15:04.790 --> 15:05.871
Lubbock. In Lubbock. Yeah. It's on the Tech 
campus.

15:10.896 --> 15:13.939
Now, the West Texas Museum Association? That's 
what it's called. It's known as the West Texas

15:14.900 --> 15:17.883
Museum Association. Is that connected with the 
ranch headquarters? That's part of it. The ranch

15:23.288 --> 15:24.890
headquarters is part of it. And the Tech Museum is 
not? And the Tech Museum, that's all the same.

15:29.234 --> 15:29.374
Uh-huh.

15:32.915 --> 15:33.914
OK.
