00:01.162 --> 00:11.454
rating is required for many of those positions, I 
would say probably 80% of the two-star positions

00:01.162 --> 00:11.454
in the Air Force Reserve are automatically ruled 
out to me because I'm not rated. But by process of

00:12.355 --> 00:25.971
elimination, there are, I would say, six two-star 
jobs that are eligible, that are open to non-rated

00:12.355 --> 00:25.971
people. I would say at least four of those are 
filled with people that are young enough that

00:26.322 --> 00:34.394
they're going to be in it longer than I have time 
within which to make my rank. So there's only one

00:34.414 --> 00:44.309
and possibly two positions in the entire Air Force 
Reserve that may open up in time for me to be

00:34.414 --> 00:44.309
considered for them. And the competition is 
unbelievable because anybody you talk to is going

00:44.489 --> 00:54.945
to have, they're going to be water walkers as the 
current fad is around, you know, They're just

00:55.330 --> 00:56.952
absolutely perfect. All of them are. So then it 
boils down to who knows who and

00:58.414 --> 01:08.669
really basically what the active duty guy, who he 
wants in that position. A lot of times if he knows

01:08.689 --> 01:13.195
one guy and doesn't know another guy, he'll pick 
the guy he knows. And that's normal. So although

01:15.398 --> 01:25.152
technically it's possible and it's something 
that I certainly have hopes for, I'm not overly

01:15.398 --> 01:25.152
optimistic that I'll ever make the second star. 
But

01:27.022 --> 01:31.047
I went either way. Because if I don't make the 
second star in

01:32.408 --> 01:42.159
just a little over three years and eight months, 
I'll retire from the military. And that would give

01:42.179 --> 01:45.283
me a lot more time to do other things that I want to 
do. If I do make it, then of course, I'll have to

01:46.324 --> 01:52.912
spend more time, an additional five years from the 
day I pin it on. But then I would have accomplished

01:53.673 --> 01:56.556
that goal. Win or lose, I'm going to be a winner on 
that. That must be a great feeling. It is. It is. The

02:04.275 --> 02:22.918
only thing that can really cause me problems now as 
far as self-image and personal goal

02:04.275 --> 02:22.918
accomplishments and so forth would be a breakdown 
of my health because I like what I'm doing. I'm in a

02:22.998 --> 02:24.400
job I want to do. My boss seems to be pleased with 
what I'm doing, at least for the time being, and I

02:24.869 --> 02:29.335
hope to keep it that way. The university is doing 
well. It's just a great job and a great feeling, and

02:33.000 --> 02:38.267
I really enjoy it every day to the fullest. Well, 
that seems to be a nice place to stop. Not bad. Not

02:43.755 --> 02:44.216
bad. Thank you very much.
