WEBVTT

00:05.313 --> 00:32.383
that unless A&M terminated its

00:05.313 --> 00:32.383
policy, which refused admission to women,

00:05.313 --> 00:32.383
terminated racial segregation, and made the 
Corps optional, that we did not believe it would

00:05.313 --> 00:32.383
grow.

00:35.435 --> 01:05.003
I particularly called his, attempted to 
particularly call his attention to our, one of our

00:35.435 --> 01:05.003
committee studies, that if we remained,

00:35.435 --> 01:05.003
if none of those changes were made,

00:35.435 --> 01:05.003
that we believe the enrollment

00:35.435 --> 01:05.003
of the Indium College of Texas on its 100th 
anniversary would be only a few hundred larger

01:06.198 --> 01:14.187
than it was in the early 60s, slightly more than 
7,000.

01:17.651 --> 01:33.049
And that in the table of variable growth

01:17.651 --> 01:33.049
patterns, the highest would be

01:35.763 --> 01:49.199
for the admission of women into racial 
segregation and making the Corps of Cadets

01:35.763 --> 01:49.199
optional, which seemed to lead to about 16,000 in 
1976.

01:56.608 --> 02:05.719
Of course, hindsight now tells us

01:56.608 --> 02:05.719
that the number crunchers were incorrect by about 
a third for the enrollment in the mid-70s reached

02:07.657 --> 02:17.229
24,000 or so.

02:23.176 --> 02:37.174
In that unforgettable conversation with Dean 
Hall, I attempted to say that I could not in good

02:23.176 --> 02:37.174
faith make many of the changes President Rutter 
had requested because he was disagreeing not with

02:38.285 --> 03:03.070
our objective findings, but our subjective, and 
that the committee really believed

02:38.285 --> 03:03.070
was in true agreement on its recommendations.

03:03.090 --> 03:04.832
Quietly, he looked me in the eye and responded, 
quote, I will stake my job on your responsibility,

03:07.073 --> 03:34.781
on your ability

03:07.073 --> 03:34.781
to reflect

03:07.073 --> 03:34.781
what the committee really recommends.

03:34.801 --> 03:35.342
I then rewrote

03:36.385 --> 04:05.852
I did recast the report in a few instances to 
correct some wording

03:36.385 --> 04:05.852
some to polish some of the wording but made no 
changes of any importance

03:36.385 --> 04:05.852
I kept draft

04:06.355 --> 04:12.464
copy with Mr. Rudder's comments for a few weeks and 
then one Sunday morning as we were ready to head as

04:12.525 --> 04:34.118
our

04:12.525 --> 04:34.118
we were in the car to head to Sunday school the phone 
rang and I went inside to answer it and heard the

04:36.663 --> 04:46.693
voice of Doris McQuarrie, President Rutter's 
trusted assistant.

04:46.713 --> 05:04.510
He was inquiring about the report which Vice 
President Hull had told, the report which Mr.

04:46.713 --> 05:04.510
Rutter had annotated, which Vice President Hull 
had told the President that I still retain.

05:07.190 --> 05:19.809
I told Mr. McCrory, Colonel McCrory, that report 
was accurate and that I could get it back to him,

05:07.190 --> 05:19.809
quote, in a few days. He promptly responded that he 
would meet me at the Nagel Hall parking lot in five

05:22.073 --> 05:33.130
minutes and I was to hand it to him.

05:38.290 --> 06:05.057
Thus, I did not have an opportunity to make a copy of 
those historic comments, which I now wish was

05:38.290 --> 06:05.057
available for all of us to study because it would 
demonstrate how much progress

05:38.290 --> 06:05.057
we have made.

06:12.007 --> 06:18.373
Paragraph.

06:18.393 --> 06:39.853
A few weeks later, a

06:18.393 --> 06:39.853
report, we heard that President Rutter, that soon 
after reading the final version of the

06:18.393 --> 06:39.853
Aspirations report, That president rudder 
summoned the four Deans.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.522
And vice president hauled to his office. This 
group included. Dr Al Price. The Dean of

07:01.033 --> 07:02.315
Veterinary Medicine.

07:08.284 --> 07:09.486
Identified by. students and faculty a slick owl 
because when the Dean of Veterinary Medicine

07:11.474 --> 07:29.620
finished a project, it was always polished, well 
done, and the smooth and smooth at all of its

07:11.474 --> 07:29.620
services. A skillful effort.

07:37.592 --> 07:39.675
Frank Hubert, the Dean of the School of Arts and 
Sciences

07:40.499 --> 07:52.633
was a man who would not back away from his 
principles.

07:59.100 --> 08:07.249
He was highly respected throughout the state

07:59.100 --> 08:07.249
and

08:13.203 --> 08:19.831
blessed with a strong backbone. Gus Watkins, Dean 
of Agriculture,

08:19.851 --> 08:39.396
a man of keen insight and quiet determination,

08:19.851 --> 08:39.396
was respected for his integrity.

08:42.734 --> 09:11.239
And Fred Benson, the dean of engineering,

08:42.734 --> 09:11.239
was known to one and all

08:42.734 --> 09:11.239
as a leader who could get to the point of any matter 
without delay.

09:16.231 --> 09:44.263
According to the report, President Rutter seated

09:16.231 --> 09:44.263
the five

09:16.231 --> 09:44.263
administrators opposite his desk and then began 
to lecture them

09:16.231 --> 09:44.263
strongly about

09:16.231 --> 09:44.263
the danger of these recommendations quote 
getting out of control

09:46.066 --> 10:14.318
that they might that these dreams might have gone 
beyond reality and might stir up

09:46.066 --> 10:14.318
arguments that would endanger the entire 
institution

09:46.066 --> 10:14.318
he also reminded his staff that they were supposed 
to have

10:16.154 --> 10:45.452
kept him informed and kept and quote kept things in 
line period

10:16.154 --> 10:45.452
quote when he asked but then he turned to each of the 
individuals and asked them for their personal

10:16.154 --> 10:45.452
opinion of how these matters had come to fruition. 
Three of the five later stated in my presence that

10:53.761 --> 11:13.971
they had attempted to make excuses, pointed in the 
other direction, had tried to dodge, duck, and

10:53.761 --> 11:13.971
avoid the blame. Their version indicated that the 
first four respondents

11:16.668 --> 11:26.981
had spoken the same message.

11:30.105 --> 11:35.292
And then President Rutter got to the remaining 
member of the quintet. And ask his opinion.

11:41.580 --> 11:42.962
But calm response.

11:46.385 --> 12:10.359
was something to the effect

11:46.385 --> 12:10.359
that, quote, Earl, you asked

11:46.385 --> 12:10.359
these people to study these matters for a number of 
months and to give you their recommendations.

12:10.379 --> 12:14.265
If you didn't want to hear those recommendations,

12:16.945 --> 12:20.209
Maybe you shouldn't have asked for him in the first 
place.

12:23.553 --> 12:25.215
Then that advisor.

12:31.442 --> 12:37.429
Picked up his hat and walked out of the conference 
room. To the surprise. Of all of the remaining of

12:40.653 --> 12:44.978
his colleagues and the meeting adjourned. In less 
than a half hour, President Rutter called the Dean

12:47.422 --> 12:58.296
of Engineering and said, thank you, Fred. I needed 
that message. I'm grateful for your candor.

13:13.555 --> 13:14.256
Another important event occurred at about that 
time, many miles away.

13:27.126 --> 13:44.428
Ed Cooper, who succeeded Dorsey McCrory as 
assistant to President Rutter and later served in

13:27.126 --> 13:44.428
a similar capacity for President Jack Williams, 
and then

13:45.657 --> 14:15.073
was the remarkably successful dean of admissions 
and records,

13:45.657 --> 14:15.073
said that

13:45.657 --> 14:15.073
an old friend,

13:45.657 --> 14:15.073
and as I'm saying this, I'm passing not far from the 
LBJ Ranch, Don't put that in the typescript, or at

14:15.982 --> 14:19.707
least we won't put it in the final version.

14:25.114 --> 14:45.060
Cooper thought that one of the important steps and 
this remarkably important transformation of A&M

14:25.114 --> 14:45.060
occurred, quote, at a bed and breakfast, perhaps 
in the wee hours of the morning, after two old

14:47.082 --> 14:53.291
friends had shared

14:47.082 --> 14:53.291
a cool beverage.

14:57.777 --> 15:00.721
Period quote. This interpretation,

15:00.741 --> 15:15.182
this conversation

15:00.741 --> 15:15.182
occurred between the Vice President and soon to be 
between the President of the United States

15:16.445 --> 15:29.762
and the former mayor of Brady, Texas.

15:48.507 --> 15:49.088
Because. In the historic 1948.

15:57.976 --> 15:58.997
Senate campaign.

16:03.140 --> 16:05.022
Earl Rudder, then the mayor of Brady. Had served as 
the campaign chairman.

16:12.189 --> 16:13.310
For LBJ. In the Hill Country counties.

16:22.510 --> 16:22.910
Mrs. Rudder recalled that the then

16:22.970 --> 16:51.741
representative from the Hill Country had come to 
their front room in Brady and asked her husband to

16:22.970 --> 16:51.741
coordinate the Johnson campaign in the Hill 
Country. Quote, although I know you probably

16:53.375 --> 17:07.093
can't carry McCulloch County since my opponent, 
Coach Stevenson,

16:53.375 --> 17:07.093
is from Junction in Kimball County. But do the best 
you can, Earl. Period. Quote.

17:18.327 --> 17:22.673
Rudders, skillful leadership. produced 183 vote 
majority in Kimball County.

17:30.676 --> 17:48.998
And later it was a that margin was a matter of 
teasing and smiles when the president, the United

17:30.676 --> 17:48.998
States would remind the A and M chief executive 
officer

17:51.644 --> 17:53.586
Quote quote Earl. Without your success in the Hill 
Country. We wouldn't have had that 87 vote

17:59.291 --> 18:09.560
landslide statewide.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.602
But in the Cooper recollection. Apparently, 
according to the Cooper recollection.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.250
Apparently, Lyndon Johnson. told Mr. Rutter that 
he had to get, quote, had to get A&M moving because

18:22.373 --> 18:42.832
it wasn't growing, was standing still, and the 
other schools are passing A&M by, period, quote.

18:44.754 --> 18:51.840
So if A&M expected to be able, quote, to get money 
from the federal government quote, it was going to

18:53.845 --> 19:01.256
have to grow in size and quality.

19:06.804 --> 19:17.619
The president also noted that the courts had 
already, the federal courts had already decided

19:06.804 --> 19:17.619
the matter of

19:06.804 --> 19:17.619
racial integration. And thus A&M had no choice on 
that matter.

19:24.473 --> 19:38.791
And apparently, he wondered how long it might be 
before the courts could possibly reach a similar

19:24.473 --> 19:38.791
decision regarding the exclusion of women.

19:43.517 --> 19:53.029
Apparently, the tall Texan told his old hill 
country friend, I'll back you. and reminded him

19:54.916 --> 20:18.143
that new governor John Connolly and his wife 
Nellie had been close friends, close

19:54.916 --> 20:18.143
undergraduate friends during their years

19:54.916 --> 20:18.143
with Margaret Rutter during the years that the 
three of them shared at the University of Texas.

20:21.526 --> 20:23.809
Also, apparently, There was mention that 
Sterling Evans, chairman of the NM Board of

20:24.295 --> 20:48.932
Directors, was an old land entrepreneur friend of 
LBJ's, and he was known to be a supporter of

20:24.295 --> 20:48.932
coeducation.

20:48.952 --> 20:53.779
An added advantage was that Rutter and 
Congressman Jake Pickle who had represented the

20:55.717 --> 21:04.787
Austin area in Congress for many years, had been 
acquainted since their junior high days.

21:08.851 --> 21:21.825
Perhaps unknown to LBJ was the fact that Bill 
Moore, the state senator from Brazos County,

21:24.235 --> 21:54.073
known as the Bull of the Brazos because of his 
determined manner of leadership

21:24.235 --> 21:54.073
in the State Affairs Committee of the upper house 
in the legislature, was also a

21:24.235 --> 21:54.073
determined advocate of coeducation and 
voluntary status for the court.

22:00.533 --> 22:29.477
Senator Moore

22:00.533 --> 22:29.477
quietly determined in terms of his 
conversational style

22:00.533 --> 22:29.477
to masses,

22:00.533 --> 22:29.477
but doggedly

22:00.533 --> 22:29.477
energetic

22:00.533 --> 22:29.477
in his Senate Manor

22:31.297 --> 22:51.762
thought that A&M needed to change, particularly 
regarding women, possibly because he had a

22:31.297 --> 22:51.762
daughter who might be an Aggie if females could 
enroll there.

22:55.046 --> 23:01.033
Perhaps it is now safe

22:55.046 --> 23:01.033
for the author of these remarks to admit

23:01.942 --> 23:20.450
a leak in the privacy

23:01.942 --> 23:20.450
of the RISL recommendations near the termination 
of that committee's efforts.

23:24.556 --> 23:30.565
Blue Book Benton,

23:24.556 --> 23:30.565
a cherished departmental colleague

23:31.439 --> 23:59.269
in government

23:31.439 --> 23:59.269
and a always devoted

23:31.439 --> 23:59.269
yellow dog democrat

23:31.439 --> 23:59.269
came to me one day and asked if the committee had

24:00.852 --> 24:12.967
made a final decision regarding its 
recommendations.

24:12.987 --> 24:27.585
I indicated that was correct, but that we could not 
publicly, but that those conclusions were to be

24:12.987 --> 24:27.585
kept private. Then with a smile he asked if I might 
be willing

24:29.692 --> 24:56.880
to share those recommendations with a quote 
stranger

24:29.692 --> 24:56.880
who

24:29.692 --> 24:56.880
was, who enjoyed a quote key place

24:59.915 --> 25:08.123
in the Texas Senate.

25:08.144 --> 25:27.964
I tried to respond to his inquiry

25:08.144 --> 25:27.964
with unspoken approval

25:08.144 --> 25:27.964
and he then described

25:08.144 --> 25:27.964
how a stranger might knock on my dark office door

25:30.374 --> 25:59.706
early in the evening

25:30.374 --> 25:59.706
a few days a few nights later

25:30.374 --> 25:59.706
with a certain

25:30.374 --> 25:59.706
sequence

25:30.374 --> 25:59.706
and that then I could invite that visitor to enter.

26:09.839 --> 26:25.575
If the light was off, then in all truth, neither 
party would have, quote, any idea who the other

26:09.839 --> 26:25.575
person was.

26:33.267 --> 26:34.488
When that evening came.

26:38.092 --> 26:38.913
I heard the knock. Invited the stranger in.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.882
And in the darkness it did seem like. That this. 
Unknown person. Or some resemblance.

26:59.333 --> 27:00.034
To my. to the pictures of the state senator that I 
had seen.

27:08.599 --> 27:29.785
Within a few minutes,

27:08.599 --> 27:29.785
I indicated the committee's recommendations in 
favor of women, racial integration, voluntary

27:08.599 --> 27:29.785
membership in the Corps of Cadets, and higher 
admissions at A&M. He thanked me and left.

27:43.294 --> 27:54.574
Meanwhile, other steps were underway to help 
ensure that the recommended changes would become

27:43.294 --> 27:54.574
fact.

28:02.148 --> 28:29.843
Since it was the election year of 1964,

28:02.148 --> 28:29.843
Jack Creighton, C-R-I-C-H-T-O-N,

28:02.148 --> 28:29.843
the president of the Association of Former 
Students, announced his candidacy for the

28:02.148 --> 28:29.843
Republican nomination

28:02.148 --> 28:29.843
as the Republican nominee for governor. That 
meant that he would have to resign his service, his

28:31.088 --> 28:38.279
position with the FSA. And John Lindsay, the 
president-elect from Houston, move up to serve in

28:40.563 --> 28:53.262
that capacity.

28:53.282 --> 28:57.028
Lindsay, like Dick Hervey, the soon-to-retire 
director of the FSA, of the former students, and

28:58.561 --> 29:16.348
Buck Wirus, the incoming director, all favored 
these changes.

29:20.234 --> 29:24.501
These events came to a peak

29:29.054 --> 29:46.915
when the A&M Board of Directors convene at the MSC 
to vote their opinion, their recommendations, to

29:29.054 --> 29:46.915
vote their decision regarding these matters.

29:52.803 --> 29:59.010
The day before their paragraph,

29:52.803 --> 29:59.010
the day before their session,

29:59.783 --> 30:27.799
some of us heard that what we thought was a very 
senior A&M graduate from the class of either 1898

29:59.783 --> 30:27.799
or 99 was planning to get a group of students to go 
with him to speak in opposition to the changes.

30:31.930 --> 30:44.289
He invited

30:31.930 --> 30:44.289
students to join him in a discussion at the head of 
the stairs in the MSC.

30:47.755 --> 30:58.832
Ray Stevens, a new colleague in Texas history, and 
I thought if we took off our coats and ties, we might

30:47.755 --> 30:58.832
walk over there and be mistaken for students. 
Little did we realize that no such

31:04.569 --> 31:12.523
misidentification would occur.

31:15.348 --> 31:26.507
But we listened in amusement as this gentleman 
lectured the students about how A&M
