00:00:02.596 --> 00:00:13.707
Indeed, for several years, I did have the opportunity to work closely with Professor Eleanor Cox in teaching in the Department of Biology.

00:00:15.088 --> 00:00:18.812
And then, for whatever reason, that did not continue.

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:24.077
I got, I guess, too busy when our own program over here got in full swing.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:30.763
I have some regrets that that relationship did not continue strongly.

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:45.457
because I think that in my own experiences, my teaching of undergraduates has been a real highlight of my academic career.

00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:56.730
And I have missed, I think there has been an opportunity missed for me in not continuing that.

00:00:57.251 --> 00:00:59.974
Now, I agree totally with what you're saying.

00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:12.517
give some examples from your own experience of the enjoyment and the strengthening of your own work from those undergraduate?

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:26.299
Oh, I think that the excitement of a young mind being stimulated to new ideas and understandings, there's just nothing to compare to it.

00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:39.580
And can you give some examples from the experience here of where the medical program benefited of being a neighbor to veterinary medicine,

00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:42.261
College of Science and Engineering and so forth?

00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:45.344
Well, I think that there have been many missed opportunities.

00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:54.515
I think that the synergism has been talked about but never fully delivered for a variety of reasons.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:02:04.707
Antagonisms developed based on individual personality clashes that have

00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:09.963
in large measure prevented such beneficial interactions.

00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:12.627
And that's one of my deep regrets.

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:29.530
The year I served as interim dean of this college, which was in 1987-88, after the resignation of Bob Stone, I did everything I could in a short period of a year to enhance those interactions.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:43.462
I remember going to a meeting of the Board of Regents to give a report on the College of Medicine and that was the emphasis of my report that we were working quite diligently to strengthen these interactions.

00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:45.527
I worked very hard that year

00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:55.626
with Dean Kochenauer to put together an executive MBA program for medical residents in Temple.

00:02:56.507 --> 00:03:05.423
For whatever reason, that never came to fruition, but I thought it was one of the greatest ideas and a lost opportunity.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.494
And you imply that Kockenauer favored it.

00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:12.397
We both favored it.

00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:22.471
But there was some reluctance, I guess, in the Scott and White organization to offer such an experience for residents in medicine.

00:03:23.252 --> 00:03:26.537
But it was also the timing was not right.

00:03:26.857 --> 00:03:30.382
Distance learning had not yet come into vogue.

00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:33.587
And I think that may have been the biggest snag of all.

00:03:34.732 --> 00:03:35.738
All right, now let's go back.

00:03:36.563 --> 00:03:39.139
You entered the dean's office when?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:49.048
Well, I served as Bob Stone's assistant dean for curriculum and undergraduate education for a couple of years prior to his resignation.

00:03:49.468 --> 00:03:51.130
And in that role, what was your task?

00:03:51.150 --> 00:04:09.666
And my task was to continue to work with the curriculum and all the other academic kinds of activities representing the dean's office in that arena.

00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:10.826
Bob resigned.

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:17.656
I moved in as interim dean and was in the office for about 13 months.

00:04:18.397 --> 00:04:28.771
I remained in the dean's office with the appointment of Richard Duvall as dean, as his principal associate dean, and remained there for the next couple of years.

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:35.721
What were the major problems you had to cope with that year as the interim dean?

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:48.766
Certainly the most vexing issue was a case of scientific fraud alleged by one of the faculty members in the College of Medicine.

00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:57.675
And I must say it was the most difficult issue, I think, and challenge that I have ever encountered in academe.

00:04:58.136 --> 00:05:03.982
Was the allegation against another faculty member?

00:05:04.482 --> 00:05:04.763
Yes.

00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:07.125
And you had to work with it?

00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:14.098
And there were no guidelines in the university at that time on how to deal with alleged scientific fraud.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.583
And so it was...

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:22.093
I'm sure that consumed an immense amount of people.

00:05:25.482 --> 00:05:32.048
It was eventually, the fraud, the allegation was eventually substantiated.

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:36.191
The individual was forced to leave the university.

00:05:37.552 --> 00:05:46.279
The individual was eventually banned from federal support for research.

00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:51.604
What were some of the plus events of that year?

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:55.287
What were some of the joys, pleasures, satisfactions?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:13.478
I guess the year I was in the dean's office full time, I never left my teaching responsibilities.

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:24.349
And I came to the classroom a different kind of person, I guess, or at least I think the students perceived that I was somebody different.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:34.318
But I found the greatest joy in being able to continue my contact with the students despite the administrative load.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.043
I didn't drop a single lecture.

00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:41.792
I did exactly what I always did that entire year.

00:06:42.253 --> 00:06:45.660
Do you think it would be healthy if administrators normally did?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.026
I think that it is absolutely crucial to their survival.

00:06:49.968 --> 00:06:56.982
If they are committed to education, that's where they, that they've got to make that commitment.

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:04.236
I've often thought if we required all researchers to do some teaching and all teachers to do some researching.

00:07:04.537 --> 00:07:05.057
Absolutely.

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:06.920
I feel very strongly about that.

00:07:10.384 --> 00:07:12.146
Dr. Stone resigned.

00:07:12.186 --> 00:07:16.432
You served for about a year, and then Dr. Duvall came.

00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:16.852
Yes.

00:07:17.613 --> 00:07:21.819
And you stayed on as the associate.

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:23.441
As his principal associate dean.

00:07:23.461 --> 00:07:24.302
And what were your responsibilities?

00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:36.416
Well, again, in the area of I was eventually given the title Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, and so I dealt with all the issues that dealt with the educational program, faculty appointments.

00:07:42.443 --> 00:07:48.610
What was it like in that period once the medical program becomes solid?

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:52.534
How difficult was it to recruit faculty?

00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:59.003
I think that we have never had any difficulty recruiting faculty to this College of Medicine.

00:07:59.063 --> 00:08:01.005
Why is that so?

00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:22.808
At least, my sense is that so long as we were a college of Texas A&M University, I think that the recruitment issues are becoming much more acute with the separation of the college into a freestanding health science center under the system.

00:08:22.788 --> 00:08:33.480
I think that in retrospect, in my own personal very strong feeling is that separation of the college from the university was a tragic, tragic mistake.

00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:34.882
When did that occur?

00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:38.265
Well, officially about two years ago.

00:08:40.628 --> 00:08:49.538
Richard Duvall, the dean who was appointed in 1988, had a sense that that ought to happen eventually.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:52.163
And so the seed was planted back then.

00:08:52.203 --> 00:09:08.995
And indeed, while I remained in the dean's office, I was asked to prepare a minute order for consideration by the Board of Regents to name the College of Medicine a health science center.

00:09:10.122 --> 00:09:20.637
recognizing that this would be a health science center within Texas A&M University, with the College of Medicine being the central program associated with the health science center.

00:09:21.158 --> 00:09:24.743
I think that is the way it should have stayed, in my view.

00:09:25.484 --> 00:09:40.045
I think that the separation has cut us off from what I consider to be the irreplaceable heritage of this College of Medicine, as starting on the campus of a major research-based university.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:48.195
One of the problems of all medical schools is to establish an identity.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:54.699
And I think that that identity is usually born from the unique character of the school.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.462
We had some unique characters.

00:09:58.565 --> 00:10:12.124
The separation into a health science center from the university puts us more in the pattern of all other medical schools and denies us the very attributes that I think made us special in the first place.

00:10:12.826 --> 00:10:18.013
Do you feel comfortable in saying who the primary movers were toward the separation?

00:10:19.006 --> 00:10:32.541
Well, I'm quite certain that Dr. Smith was one of the key movers in that direction.

00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:43.794
It all happened during the deanship of Michael Friedland, so I'm sure that he was a party to that separation.

00:10:46.156 --> 00:10:47.798
What was their primary argument?

00:10:49.313 --> 00:10:50.566
I think that it was

00:10:54.595 --> 00:11:08.670
Primarily for the purpose of cozying up to the legislature and for legislative financial support to make this program essentially equivalent to all the other medical programs in the state of Texas.

00:11:09.611 --> 00:11:18.601
As a college of Texas A&M University, the College of Medicine did not have a direct line to legislative hearings, to dealing with budgetary issues.

00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:20.503
But they thought they would get more money.

00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:20.803
Yes.

00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:24.467
So far, do you have any observation?

00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:27.181
I think that it has worked the other way.

00:11:28.683 --> 00:11:29.745
I think that we have gotten less.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:45.424
Now that the program is a quarter of a century old, what are the trademarks of A&M medical graduates?

00:11:46.786 --> 00:11:49.189
I think that we continue to benefit from

00:11:50.789 --> 00:12:10.958
the small class size from the opportunities for very personal interactions between faculty and students with a very large caseload in our clinical facilities that cannot be matched in any other medical setting, certainly not in Texas.

00:12:11.275 --> 00:12:37.170
It might surprise you, Haskell, to know that the number of patient visits to our clinical facilities in Central Texas, meaning Scott and White, the VA, and Fort Hood, that number is roughly equivalent to the total patient visits to the Texas Medical Center in Houston, which supports two medical schools, both of which are substantially larger than this one.

00:12:37.551 --> 00:12:38.412
That's remarkable.

00:12:38.572 --> 00:12:39.173
Isn't it?

00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:41.804
Oh, that is good.

00:12:42.224 --> 00:12:43.386
Good for all concerned.

00:12:43.406 --> 00:12:43.887
Yes, indeed.

00:12:44.447 --> 00:12:44.708
It is.

00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:54.039
The students have scored highly on all of the...

00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:55.982
The students have truly excelled.

00:12:56.202 --> 00:13:03.912
I mean, far beyond anyone's expectations on their licensure examinations, the board exams.

00:13:04.465 --> 00:13:09.522
The state examined medical jurisprudence required for licensing in Texas.

00:13:10.345 --> 00:13:14.880
I think that our expectations have been far exceeded.

00:13:15.113 --> 00:13:26.807
And I think that we have lived up to the original hope for this medical school, that a large proportion of our graduates would end up in primary care specialties, particularly family practice.

00:13:26.827 --> 00:13:40.142
And I think that the numbers show that we are doing better than any other school in the state, percentage-wise anyway, in providing physicians to primary care specialties.

00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:43.562
And the reason for that, you think, is?

00:13:44.203 --> 00:13:46.248
Well, certainly a large part of it is role models.

00:13:46.749 --> 00:13:48.192
I mean, I'm sure of that.

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:55.026
And who are some of those role models?

00:13:58.195 --> 00:14:08.292
Well, I don't know how to answer that historically, but it doesn't hurt to have a family practice physician occupy the deanship currently.

00:14:08.332 --> 00:14:17.588
The first woman to be president of the AMA is remarkable, and that's not lost on the students.

00:14:17.905 --> 00:14:29.420
I think that we have a very, very strong department of family practice whose leader for that group has been for many years now, Don Cawthon in Temple.

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:40.335
And he has recruited a cadre of really superb family practice physicians who I think just shine with our students.

00:14:40.501 --> 00:14:49.195
And there has been, over the years, good teamwork between the campus, Scott & White, and the VA

00:14:49.900 --> 00:15:11.284
uh have there been any uh pebbles in the road any major problems that had to be worked out oh occasionally the va has felt that it has taken a back seat or been forced into a back seat and they're not a primary player i and that issue comes up every couple of years and they need to uh

00:15:11.264 --> 00:15:17.513
be patted on the shoulder occasionally and told what a wonderful job they're doing.

00:15:18.534 --> 00:15:19.876
But we've managed that okay.

00:15:21.238 --> 00:15:29.249
And what about with Scott & White?

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:32.814
First rate medical institution.

00:15:36.999 --> 00:15:38.301
It is...

00:15:40.745 --> 00:15:55.366
an exemplary reference hospital and with a very, very large outpatient service, I think that the kinds of experiences that our students get there are unmatched anywhere.

00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:56.848
Unmatched.

00:15:59.332 --> 00:16:00.053
The

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:18.146
Looking at this 25 years, what has A&M's medical program, what fields, what parts of the preparation of these medical students have been done best and which parts need additional strength?

00:16:18.326 --> 00:16:29.280
I think that we need to remind ourselves periodically of Jim Knight's dream for this college in educating

00:16:29.564 --> 00:16:34.830
physicians with a very substantial humanistic sense.

00:16:36.072 --> 00:16:44.922
I think that we sometimes get too much into the science of medicine and forget about the art of medicine.

00:16:45.643 --> 00:16:51.690
And really that's what humanistic sensitivity means to me.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:59.489
We get so carried away with the high-tech of modern medicine, but that's only part of dealing with sick people.

00:17:01.792 --> 00:17:13.948
And I think that we don't do as well in that category as I think we could, given other circumstances that are small.

00:17:14.215 --> 00:17:17.238
number of students we deal with, a very large faculty.

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:25.806
And I don't know what our total faculty size is now, but it must be six or seven hundred altogether.

00:17:26.187 --> 00:17:30.211
And that's nearly ten faculty per student in a class.

00:17:30.691 --> 00:17:33.634
That's a huge, huge ratio.

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:41.281
Can you think of any other institution that could, any other medical school that could claim such numbers?

00:17:41.301 --> 00:17:42.923
No, I can't think of a single one.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:55.120
Also, describe as much as you can financially in terms of cost to the state and so forth.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.566
Isn't this medical school comparatively inexpensive?

00:17:58.782 --> 00:18:07.533
Well, I haven't seen any numbers lately, and the only numbers I can recall seeing indeed are the ones I saw when I was interim dean, and that's 12 years ago.

00:18:08.595 --> 00:18:18.167
We stood very favorably in terms of cost to the state per student with the other Texas medical schools.

00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:25.617
We weren't the cheapest, but we were certainly not even close to being the most expensive.

00:18:26.255 --> 00:18:30.987
And how much do we benefit by not having to operate our own hospital?

00:18:31.268 --> 00:18:34.957
Oh, that's a tremendous asset that I think so few people realize.

00:18:36.341 --> 00:18:41.614
I think that's one of our true strengths, that we don't need to worry about the operation of a hospital.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.022
Among other things, it saves us a lot of lawsuits.

00:18:45.263 --> 00:18:45.683
Indeed.

00:18:48.766 --> 00:19:00.696
Down through the years, the typical medical student now has four years of undergraduate, typical A&M medical student, four years of undergraduate preparation.

00:19:01.337 --> 00:19:05.340
And where do most of these students graduate?

00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:07.402
What school or schools?

00:19:10.745 --> 00:19:10.825
Hmm.

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:18.942
I don't recall seeing any information recently about that.

00:19:20.666 --> 00:19:24.495
We still draw a fair number of our students from A&M.

00:19:25.838 --> 00:19:28.965
There are a large number of students from University of Texas.

00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:33.426
We get a large number of students from Baylor and Waco.

00:19:35.792 --> 00:19:40.062
And then a smattering from some of the smaller schools around the state.

00:19:40.864 --> 00:19:45.857
We are limited by legislative action to taking only 10% from out of state.

00:19:46.192 --> 00:19:48.836
and so those numbers are very low.

00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:54.263
The representation is broad, however.

00:19:54.363 --> 00:20:06.800
We, on occasion, get someone from California or from New York State, but there's only two or three in a class, and that's a very small number.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:15.912
I think that may be a disadvantage for us, that we do not have the benefit of a rather cosmopolitan student population.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.830
Can you make any kind of generalization about the family background of the typical A&M student?

00:20:22.852 --> 00:20:26.519
Are they working class, middle class, rural, urban?

00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:31.048
I think that increasingly we're finding that they're coming from urban areas.

00:20:31.501 --> 00:20:35.587
more so than initially for this program.

00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:49.408
I think that we find a fair percentage of our students coming from professional families, that is to say physician families, either where a mother or father or both are physicians.

00:20:56.999 --> 00:21:00.985
What is the key to their high scores on all of the

00:21:02.568 --> 00:21:26.668
Well, I think that we're capturing intellectually sound individuals, number one, and secondly, their experience while here is absolutely relevant to their performance on those kinds of measures.

00:21:28.606 --> 00:21:35.516
During your 25 years here, what are some of the most joyful moments you remember?

00:21:41.685 --> 00:21:42.105
Personally?

00:21:42.346 --> 00:21:45.250
Yes, yes.

00:21:49.155 --> 00:21:55.845
Getting back to the classroom after that hiatus was one of the truly joyful moments in my life.

00:21:57.293 --> 00:22:06.685
And staying in the classroom for so many of these years has been a very special opportunity for me.

00:22:11.451 --> 00:22:25.630
Becoming involved with campus-wide activities such as the faculty senate and the design and implementation of a core curriculum, the faculty club we talked about, all of these are highlights, I think, of my

00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:27.549
experiences at A&M.

00:22:32.235 --> 00:22:33.536
There have been some hurtful moments.

00:22:40.365 --> 00:22:54.823
One of the most hurtful occurred a few years ago when my successor as head of Department of Medical Microbiology decided that I was no longer needed in the classroom and I was dismissed from the teaching team.

00:22:56.305 --> 00:22:59.909
I no longer teach in microbiology.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:20.794
I hold an appointment still in that department, but I'm full-time here in the Department of Humanities and Medicine, where I do some teaching, applying my experiences from med-micro to the humanities, and maybe we can talk about that off the record.

00:23:23.204 --> 00:23:35.367
The absolute most hurtful moment of my 25 years at A&M, however, was the day that I had my life threatened by a dean, my dean.

00:23:40.116 --> 00:23:45.145
I didn't think that could happen, or that if it did happen,

00:23:45.445 --> 00:23:49.012
it would go unresolved.

00:23:50.294 --> 00:23:53.320
And this death threat was never resolved.

00:23:56.486 --> 00:23:58.149
I think I agree with you.

00:23:58.891 --> 00:24:00.314
I appealed directly to the president.

00:24:00.374 --> 00:24:02.117
The president chose to take no action.

00:24:04.021 --> 00:24:07.808
And I can tell you, Haskell, I have never been so hurt.

00:24:08.311 --> 00:24:09.652
so wounded in all of my life.

00:24:10.233 --> 00:24:11.534
I agree with you.

00:24:11.834 --> 00:24:12.555
I agree with you.

00:24:14.757 --> 00:24:22.064
Who are the, you're now giving out Oscars, you're giving out prizes.

00:24:24.286 --> 00:24:36.077
Who are the people that most deserve a pat on the back for the success of the medical program here, regardless of what their role, you know, pick from as broad a scope as you want to.

00:24:36.117 --> 00:24:37.879
Who are the people that

00:24:38.618 --> 00:24:49.629
Well, the original ideas for the medical program that came from Jim Knight, I think, still stand out in my memory.

00:24:50.369 --> 00:25:00.800
The leadership of Bob Stone, which came at a very crucial moment in our history, I think is key to our continuing success.

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:05.284
The dedicated services and

00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:09.413
good leadership qualities of people like Dr. Joyce Davis.

00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:20.163
And our help from some of the community people like Dr. O.C.

00:25:20.384 --> 00:25:21.204
Cooper.

00:25:21.264 --> 00:25:26.169
These are some of the highlights that stand out in my mind.

00:25:29.412 --> 00:25:32.976
What about some precious

00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:40.924
moments with a student or a former student where someone has paused to stop and tell you what good teaching means?

00:25:41.664 --> 00:25:52.538
A year or so ago, I had completed an elective course for second year medical students in this Department of Humanities and Medicine.

00:25:54.921 --> 00:26:01.849
It was an elective program that carried the title, Germs and the Performing Arts.

00:26:04.073 --> 00:26:22.707
in which I had the class vicariously visit the concert stage and the opera house and the drama theater and the cinema and so forth for examples of theatrical experiences that had at their roots a germ or an infectious disease.

00:26:25.049 --> 00:26:45.370
And after the completion of that course, it was weeks, maybe months after the completion, I was sitting here at my desk by myself and one of the students who had been enrolled in that experience was walking by in the corridor and glanced in and he saw me sitting here alone.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.095
And he came in and rapped in the door.

00:26:48.115 --> 00:26:51.284
He said, Dr. Black, I saw you sitting by yourself.

00:26:51.344 --> 00:26:57.682
And he said, I just had to take this opportunity to come in to thank you for that experience.

00:26:58.143 --> 00:27:01.553
You have changed my life forever.

00:27:02.208 --> 00:27:06.932
And I thought that was just the nicest tribute that a teacher could ever receive.

00:27:07.172 --> 00:27:07.653
You bet.

00:27:07.773 --> 00:27:09.474
You bet.

00:27:09.494 --> 00:27:09.995
Let's see.

00:27:10.015 --> 00:27:17.441
And a while ago, you didn't remember any times when a student tried to pull a prank or make a joke, a tease?

00:27:19.843 --> 00:27:20.924
No, and I still can't.

00:27:22.045 --> 00:27:28.210
Don't I remember some kind of problem when they first had the cadavers in the basement of the Teague building?

00:27:29.471 --> 00:27:31.573
Wasn't there something with the cleanup crew or?

00:27:32.245 --> 00:27:33.326
I don't remember.

00:27:33.967 --> 00:27:34.628
I don't remember.

00:27:34.668 --> 00:27:38.233
I think there was one of the black ladies of the cleanup crew.

00:27:38.253 --> 00:27:41.978
That's probably true, but I just don't remember.

00:27:42.659 --> 00:27:44.542
All right, let's see.

00:27:45.683 --> 00:27:55.356
What about regents and or state politicians that have been positive aides to the medical program through the years?

00:27:56.358 --> 00:27:59.502
I don't have much firsthand.

00:28:00.022 --> 00:28:01.324
information on that.

00:28:02.486 --> 00:28:09.696
I think that, in general, my impression is that the regents have been quite supportive of this program in medicine.

00:28:10.618 --> 00:28:14.824
We did have a few specific allies on the Board of Regents.

00:28:15.345 --> 00:28:20.693
Joe Reynolds, of course, stands out, and that's the regent for whom this building is named.

00:28:22.195 --> 00:28:27.683
There was a regent from Waco.

00:28:27.663 --> 00:28:29.267
Doug Ducluet.

00:28:29.287 --> 00:28:30.451
Yes, exactly.

00:28:30.491 --> 00:28:43.967
D-E-C-L-U-I-T. Doug Ducluet, I think, was a very special friend of this college, and the year I served as interim dean, we formed a very close relationship.

00:28:46.445 --> 00:28:55.301
I think that Mr. Eller, as far as I can tell from a distance, was supportive of the College of Medicine.

00:28:57.645 --> 00:29:00.470
But I don't know any other specific instances.

00:29:01.292 --> 00:29:07.423
We are very proud to have a member of our charter class now join the regents in a very special role.

00:29:10.812 --> 00:29:11.713
All right, let's see.

00:29:12.274 --> 00:29:14.737
We're getting near the end of the questions I can think of.

00:29:15.198 --> 00:29:33.483
Let's make believe that you have now been selected as a consultant to give advice to the leadership at whatever level regarding the medical program at Texas A&M and how to make it even more successful in the next quarter of a century.

00:29:33.563 --> 00:29:35.065
What advice would you give them?

00:29:37.019 --> 00:29:43.291
What should A&M be doing or not doing from now, immediate future, to make this program even better?

00:29:43.933 --> 00:29:51.047
I think that we must never lose sight of the fact that we exist primarily for the education of future physicians.

00:29:54.494 --> 00:29:57.660
It seems to me that I have

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.826
seen a de-emphasis in that as a primary mission.

00:30:03.867 --> 00:30:20.211
On occasion, I think that I have seen the development of individual research fiefdoms that do not fit properly, at least into my view of medical education and what a medical school is all about.

00:30:20.932 --> 00:30:27.782
I understand fully that research activities are essential part of a scientist's life.

00:30:27.762 --> 00:30:34.905
But I think they ought not to overshadow the primary obligation to teach students of medicine.

00:30:35.426 --> 00:30:39.780
And I think that's a serious issue to be dealt with.

00:30:40.604 --> 00:30:44.207
What about the size of the program?

00:30:44.608 --> 00:30:47.971
Oh, I would love for us to stay just exactly where we are.

00:30:50.013 --> 00:30:55.018
For years, I taught at Baylor College of Medicine, as I said, where the class size was 84.

00:30:55.438 --> 00:30:59.762
That's not too different from 64, and it's an okay number.

00:31:00.623 --> 00:31:08.350
But I hope that this school will stay elitist, again, in the finest sense of the word, elitist, small.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:14.767
so that there can be the meaningful kinds of interactions that take place between faculty and students in that setting.

00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:20.702
Should it try to change the specialties in which it is doing?
