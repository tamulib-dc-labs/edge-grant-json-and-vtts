WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:13.291
Send emails out and ask who would be willing on a pro bono basis to see our students in their hometowns if they have anything that begins to well up or create a problem.

00:13.931 --> 00:17.716
And we had, oh, I don't know how many psychologists around the state of Texas volunteer.

00:17.776 --> 00:23.622
And we only had about three to six students who used a psychologist over the Christmas break.

00:23.662 --> 00:28.828
But they saw them right in their hometown, and it was great because we lose them for four to five weeks.

00:28.848 --> 00:30.230
So that was great.

00:30.270 --> 00:32.232
The University of Texas director called me.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.538
and said, Wade, do you need me to send staff over there, which was wonderful.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.158
It was amazing how many

00:41.527 --> 00:45.733
Kids at other campuses in Texas were affected by this, because they all had friends here.

00:46.574 --> 00:50.279
And SMU, the director there, told me they were affected by the bonfire tragedy.

00:50.479 --> 00:52.101
Houston, you know, you name it.

00:53.663 --> 00:53.763
Yeah.

00:53.783 --> 00:59.872
So even in that tragedy, Aggie Spirit was... Oh, yeah, absolutely.

01:00.112 --> 01:00.713
That's what I mean.

01:01.053 --> 01:03.096
I think you feel the pain more intensely.

01:03.532 --> 01:08.963
but the support to get out of the pain is also so much greater at a school like this.

01:09.604 --> 01:10.166
It really is.

01:10.747 --> 01:23.633
Looking at all of Bonfire and how the institution handled it, what would you say in regard to how A&M dealt with that tragedy?

01:23.984 --> 01:32.236
The first thing that comes to mind is that I think the president, I mean, courageous isn't even the right word.

01:32.337 --> 01:34.540
I just like the way he bore responsibility.

01:35.201 --> 01:40.108
I would have to bet you that attorneys tried to convince him to distance himself.

01:41.210 --> 01:46.718
And bless his heart, he stood up and said, yes, I am responsible.

01:46.698 --> 01:50.484
And I think that was just the beginning of the right response.

01:52.968 --> 01:56.133
My respect and regard for him was always good.

01:56.153 --> 01:57.234
It just shot up.

01:58.096 --> 01:58.857
I think that was great.

01:58.937 --> 02:01.541
I think the independent commission was the right way to go.

02:01.561 --> 02:09.814
The fact that they had no Aggies on the thing and it was headed by somebody who's not affiliated with A&M, I thought that was the right clean way to do it.

02:09.834 --> 02:11.777
And I contrast that with my alma mater.

02:12.314 --> 02:15.517
who had two members of the Board of Regents who handled the Bobby Knight thing.

02:15.757 --> 02:22.263
There's all kinds of dual issues and conflicts and that's yucky and messy.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.165
So I think it was handled the right way.

02:24.205 --> 02:25.687
I think the President's absolutely right.

02:25.867 --> 02:27.989
He can't afford to have any more students die.

02:28.770 --> 02:30.051
He can't afford to do that.

02:30.471 --> 02:39.840
And I think the institution is taking its time and trying to be prudent and as the phrase goes, do the right thing.

02:39.820 --> 02:48.913
I just think the response to the bonfire after the tragedy has been first class, just superbly excellent, really has.

02:48.933 --> 03:04.917
I've gone to most every bonfire there's ever been since I've been here, and I never really thought about the possibilities, the risks, and the liability of that undertaking.

03:05.032 --> 03:08.459
I was probably one of those naive people who just saw you every year.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.823
This appears, and it's perfectly safe and wonderful.

03:11.164 --> 03:11.665
Same here.

03:12.447 --> 03:14.811
Gosh.

03:16.915 --> 03:17.316
Let's see.

03:18.418 --> 03:25.993
Then, looking back on all these years, of what are you most proud of your service here?

03:28.100 --> 03:29.746
I'm going to use proud and appreciative.

03:30.007 --> 03:40.101
I'm appreciative that a conservative environment that probably wasn't very psychologically minded allowed us to come in and begin to render a service

03:40.553 --> 03:42.997
that would help kids get through and graduate.

03:44.218 --> 03:45.660
That I appreciate a great deal.

03:45.741 --> 03:57.678
I appreciate the resources, the support from COLDIS and my colleagues and faculty and staff that we've dealt with have been great.

03:58.219 --> 04:08.113
I'm proud that by and large we've hired a staff that has been very student oriented and I've always

04:09.022 --> 04:25.980
Whenever I've interviewed people at conferences or here, I'm always trying to figure out, I'm trying to discriminate between the one who wants to be a professor and teach, which is very worthy, but I want the person who wants to be a service provider in that.

04:26.320 --> 04:33.508
And so I think we've had a lot, I'm proud of a lot of the staff who've come through here that either are here now or have been here.

04:33.568 --> 04:34.729
They've been really good.

04:34.769 --> 04:36.531
I have two tests that I,

04:37.051 --> 04:41.476
that are not formal and I'm sure would be looked down if Susan Erza got a hold of me.

04:41.556 --> 04:46.341
I always think in the back of my mind, number one, would I want my son and daughter counseled by this person?

04:46.881 --> 04:53.548
And number two, if this person were at a bus stop, would they even be socially desirable enough that I would even want to strike the conversation with them?

04:53.568 --> 04:56.151
If they can't pass those two tests, it's not looking good.

04:56.712 --> 05:00.656
I don't care about the PhDs or where the internship is from or any of that stuff.

05:00.676 --> 05:06.602
So I'm really proud of the staff here and the support the institution has given to the place.

05:06.582 --> 05:12.069
I'm proud of the fact that I truly believe we have saved over the years hundreds of lives.

05:12.590 --> 05:17.836
I think people would have killed themselves were it not for the environment and the people in this center.

05:20.840 --> 05:34.497
Advice to, now you're a consultant, advice for the future to this group of professionals in the counseling center, what advice would you give them?

05:35.894 --> 05:49.009
Always students are number one and I don't mean that you don't get concerned about staff, you do because without them you got nothing.

05:49.293 --> 05:53.038
You got to always remember who's paying the bills and why you're here.

05:53.639 --> 05:56.663
And it's not so you can get a paycheck.

05:56.743 --> 05:57.885
That's not the point of it all.

05:57.965 --> 05:59.587
It's to help the kids.

05:59.607 --> 06:09.040
And that's the thing that overwhelmingly, that and I think using resources prudently.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.883
I think is another thing.

06:10.923 --> 06:17.673
We're blessed at A&M with the possibilities, but I don't ever want to take those for granted.

06:18.434 --> 06:27.688
And I think everybody needs to be a good steward of the state's funds, the kids' funds, the parents' funds, the loans, all of that.

06:29.591 --> 06:33.357
The other thing is I think you've got to

06:34.619 --> 06:39.806
believe you've got to use the intrinsic rewards you get out of helping people.

06:40.707 --> 06:45.513
Because a lot of these people could go out in private practice and probably make more money, although we're not paying them badly.

06:46.134 --> 06:47.596
But they could earn more money.

06:47.896 --> 06:51.701
I think you've got to really revel in what you get out of helping people.

06:53.523 --> 06:58.109
If you're not getting a kick out of that, then probably not, you're in the wrong place.

06:58.870 --> 06:59.070
All right.

06:59.090 --> 07:02.635
Advice to Vice President Sutherland and President Bowen.

07:03.357 --> 07:05.479
Keep supporting your student counseling service.

07:07.782 --> 07:25.922
Advice to them, I would say to do all they can to support the welcoming of different groups into the culture, into the A&M culture.

07:26.493 --> 07:31.001
which I think the university has done such a good job of over the years, more and more.

07:33.866 --> 07:35.910
I think that's important.

07:43.283 --> 07:46.729
Boy, see, I think so many things that Malin does are right on target.

07:48.211 --> 07:56.726
Because I know his big kicks over the last few years have been risk management, which is critical, came out of the bonfire.

07:57.347 --> 08:01.213
Marketing, letting people know what we do and how we're available to help.

08:01.935 --> 08:06.502
Diversity, he's been supportive of that, which is what I mentioned to begin with.

08:09.688 --> 08:12.092
So he's doing so many things that are right.

08:13.844 --> 08:18.591
I don't know that I have a lot of advice for him beyond those things.

08:18.611 --> 08:21.616
And you all relocated over here under Coldus?

08:22.738 --> 08:26.764
Yes, and that was not a pretty picture for a while.

08:28.146 --> 08:34.055
Malin Sutherland, bless his heart, when he was associate VP, somehow he was in the negotiation to get this building for us.

08:34.856 --> 08:38.181
And then I was told that I would be granted

08:38.633 --> 08:42.760
$175,000 to remodel it because it was the old athletic dorm.

08:43.521 --> 08:47.168
It had, you know, cinder block walls and tile floors, and it was not very pretty.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.253
And it's not a lovely building on the outside.

08:50.293 --> 08:59.749
In fact, President Bowen is, I've heard he wants the new Residence Life Administration building built in front of ours, so it hides this building as an eyesore.

08:59.829 --> 09:02.734
But anyway, so...

09:03.507 --> 09:17.635
I was told by one person in whatever department it is in physical plant that it would take 175 to put carpet down and cover up the cinder block and make this a more inviting

09:17.918 --> 09:25.615
And then that person dropped off the job and a young woman came on it from the same department and she said, Dr. Birch, I tell you this, you got about half the money you need.

09:25.736 --> 09:27.961
You need another $175,000 to really do.

09:28.342 --> 09:36.079
I felt like I got lowball, but I understand I'm one among many people who has been displeased that the estimates they are given

09:36.582 --> 09:38.925
Oh, and I've gone through that a number of times.

09:38.965 --> 09:46.915
So anyway, that was tough because this building sat empty for 15 months while we went looking for the other 175,000.

09:47.475 --> 09:57.207
In fact, I once got so frustrated after about a year of this that I wrote John a note.

09:58.233 --> 10:01.358
And I didn't attack him directly.

10:01.458 --> 10:06.546
I attacked the situation that I thought was just had gotten ridiculous.

10:07.267 --> 10:16.240
And I remember Malin apparently saw the note and Malin said to me, boy, he said, I would never in my lifetime write to my boss a letter like that.

10:16.340 --> 10:18.564
But this is born out of a year of frustration.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.088
And staff saying to me, the building's sitting there.

10:21.128 --> 10:21.869
When are we going?

10:21.929 --> 10:23.912
Why don't you?

10:23.992 --> 10:24.713
Why?

10:24.693 --> 10:38.969
And then I had the unfortunate experience, no, I don't know if it's unfortunate, the experience of John and I going around to different officials in the university trying to find pockets of money.

10:39.769 --> 10:50.481
We visited with Jerry Gaston, we visited with Robert Smith, and it felt like

10:50.883 --> 10:59.155
a hat in hand kind of thing, like almost a begging and that, and it was not pretty.

11:00.557 --> 11:05.684
Finally, John was successful in getting the money, bless his heart, but boy, that was a frustrating 15 months.

11:05.704 --> 11:11.693
But when you did get over here, has it turned into a good... Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:11.673 --> 11:14.518
It's, like I said, the outside of the building isn't great.

11:14.538 --> 11:19.807
We were worried students, you know, the Y building's a popular building, so we were worried we came over here, students wouldn't find us.

11:20.629 --> 11:22.332
That was a fallacy.

11:23.294 --> 11:26.940
Yeah, the facility has been wonderful.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.403
So it's worked well.

11:28.884 --> 11:29.204
Great.

11:30.066 --> 11:34.153
Are there any major problems to be solved right now by your successor?

11:35.129 --> 11:35.510
Yeah.

11:37.353 --> 11:40.978
We have the career ladder that I instituted is probably too generous.

11:42.321 --> 11:45.926
I think the percentage increases from 15 need to be lowered somewhat.

11:46.387 --> 11:55.141
What's the phenomena we're having happen is that, see, it used to be in counseling centers, the only way to go up in terms of responsibility and income was to go administrative.

11:55.602 --> 11:58.627
And you get a lot of people in our business who have no interest in becoming administrative.

11:59.088 --> 12:02.453
So what we really did was we set up a parallel track

12:02.770 --> 12:04.393
of progression which was clinical.

12:04.853 --> 12:09.481
If you could become a master therapist, a master counselor psychologist, we're going to reward you.

12:09.621 --> 12:18.636
Well, I've got a situation now where I've got some senior staff psychologists who are probably only 4,000 a year under what an associate director is making.

12:19.096 --> 12:24.525
Now interestingly, Haskell, I have two female associate directors and two male associate directors.

12:24.505 --> 12:28.973
The male associate director's opinion is, hey, if that happens, that's what we intended.

12:29.454 --> 12:31.557
The two females are over my dead body.

12:32.960 --> 12:38.689
And so there's a budding problem with our compensation, our reward system.

12:38.729 --> 12:41.414
I think the percentages need to be dropped down to 12 or 10.

12:41.755 --> 12:46.884
Because, see, the psychologists and the professional counselors by job title have a career ladder.

12:46.904 --> 12:48.927
Associate directors don't have a career ladder.

12:49.075 --> 12:50.957
Other people in our center don't have it.

12:51.037 --> 12:57.385
They do, and they get this advantage, which we did for the purpose of stopping the attrition.

12:58.606 --> 12:59.868
But I think that's a problem.

13:01.289 --> 13:04.473
Space is a budding problem.

13:04.513 --> 13:10.560
We're going to be hiring hopefully a database manager, webmaster.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.262
We need space for that person to work.

13:12.883 --> 13:16.467
We need more psychologists and more academic career counselors.

13:16.784 --> 13:21.592
More than 50% of the students who come here come for learning skills and choice of major, choice of career.

13:22.673 --> 13:24.296
But that's only a staff of four people.

13:25.758 --> 13:28.303
The other 50% come for the psychological services.

13:28.363 --> 13:29.144
They stay longer.

13:29.545 --> 13:32.630
Person and personal counseling stays about six to seven sessions.

13:33.050 --> 13:35.454
Person for academic career comes about one to three.

13:36.436 --> 13:41.003
Now when you came, the staff was how many compared to now?

13:41.455 --> 13:48.463
The first year we had three, including myself, three professional staff and a secretary, and the budget was $65,000.

13:48.583 --> 13:56.132
And today it's 37 staff, all told, and the budget next year will be $2.68 million.

13:56.693 --> 13:59.536
And it's almost all of that money is student fees?

13:59.556 --> 14:04.442
86% of the fees are money as students, or 14% is E&G.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.467
Yeah, and that's what I mean.

14:06.728 --> 14:08.811
Boy, that's the thing about A&M.

14:08.831 --> 14:11.174
When it decides it'll do something, boy.

14:11.995 --> 14:16.963
So when you retire this... July, August, actually August, early August.

14:17.564 --> 14:27.679
After 27 years, as you walk out the door, you will feel how about all these years?

14:28.660 --> 14:31.965
Like I left A&M a better place than I found it.

14:33.262 --> 14:36.106
that I and the staff have done a damn good job.

14:37.469 --> 14:48.205
And if you could make a big financial contribution to A&M, for what purpose would you want your contribution used?

14:49.367 --> 14:51.991
You could do it in seven figures or more.

14:52.412 --> 14:53.013
Oh, yeah.

14:56.098 --> 14:59.623
Well, part of it would come here, obviously.

15:01.240 --> 15:07.673
But I think another part would go to any of the programs that

15:09.020 --> 15:19.793
promote the unity of the campus and the camaraderie, and I'd have to figure out which those were, but I think that's so critical to this institution.

15:19.813 --> 15:23.338
I sound like an old ag now, but it's so critical not to lose that.

15:25.020 --> 15:35.112
That's why I say I constantly am amazed at how A&M's retained its fundamental value system and at the same time opened its doors to a lot of different people.

15:35.092 --> 15:40.757
And the last question is, what feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M?

15:40.777 --> 15:43.540
Oh, can't imagine.

15:45.742 --> 15:49.485
Can't imagine working professionally in a better place than this.

15:51.147 --> 16:03.158
Resources, bright people, people who give a damn, people who are concerned with excellence,

16:04.319 --> 16:24.205
I just, I just, I mean, I love Florida State and I love Indiana University and all that, but in terms of a place to express oneself professionally and that, you do not throw your, what's the saying, the biblical one, your pearl before swine at this place.

16:24.265 --> 16:25.126
You really don't.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.711
It's worth whatever expenditure you make at A&M.

16:28.911 --> 16:31.575
It's been a stunning career for me.

16:32.155 --> 16:32.736
Great place.

16:33.657 --> 16:34.258
Let's quit there.
