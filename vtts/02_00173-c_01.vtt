WEBVTT

00:03.608 --> 00:14.580
He showed him my projections for the courses I wanted to offer, and I largely made the decision on that, and how many sections and all we wanted.

00:14.620 --> 00:18.044
He said, well, where are your figures?

00:19.386 --> 00:21.688
I pointed to my head and said, here.

00:23.310 --> 00:24.471
He said, well, I want figures.

00:26.714 --> 00:28.536
So he changed, made changes.

00:30.507 --> 00:32.129
in what I projected.

00:33.431 --> 00:38.718
And he made his projections on what the registrar's office had told him.

00:42.182 --> 00:51.594
And my projections were made on the basis of what I'd learned from Austin Curley, whose figures I found I could trust.

00:51.614 --> 00:54.658
And that was after our big bust up with

00:56.748 --> 01:03.338
with having hired three people from the figures of registrar's office at Gimmie.

01:03.358 --> 01:08.145
I had to find a different source of information, so I went to Austin Curley.

01:08.666 --> 01:10.389
Was that when he was over at the basic division?

01:11.250 --> 01:15.777
I forget what it was called, but anyhow, he interviewed all the freshmen.

01:15.797 --> 01:24.169
And he had a better idea than the registrar's office of how many students we would actually end up with.

01:24.189 --> 01:25.371
And so I went to him.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.696
and got information.

01:30.979 --> 01:44.635
After that, I would make up a bunch of figures and would take more than an economics major to figure them out and gave them to him.

01:44.655 --> 01:51.443
As long as he had figures, Maxwell was satisfied, but it still came out of my head and from what I got from Austin Curley.

01:52.553 --> 02:06.674
Of all the deans, and I'm not going to ask the negative, of all the deans that the Department of English worked under, regardless of what the name was of the unit, to which dean or deans would you give the highest marks?

02:07.395 --> 02:08.717
I forget what his name was.

02:08.737 --> 02:15.247
There was one that came, I think, after Dean Brooks.

02:15.287 --> 02:15.928
Dwayne?

02:24.768 --> 02:33.317
I danced with his wife, and one department member said, you got your raise because you danced with the dean's wife.

02:33.457 --> 02:36.900
And I said, no, I got the raise because my wife danced with the dean.

02:38.342 --> 02:51.535
We'll think about that later when it's... But anyhow, he was, I think... Billy Joe, do you remember who the dean was that...

02:52.882 --> 02:55.046
She used to come to the Dinner Dance Club.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.037
I believe she's in there.

03:01.077 --> 03:05.405
What about which president that you served under would you give the highest to?

03:05.425 --> 03:15.885
Which president would you give the highest marks?

03:17.738 --> 03:22.606
I think he would have to end up with Rudder because of the changes.

03:22.626 --> 03:32.462
I would give high marks to Maxwell in part, although some of the things he and I disagreed with hardly.

03:33.083 --> 03:37.671
I remember him calling up one time and saying,

03:37.651 --> 03:43.796
I know you refused to do this, but why?

03:44.957 --> 03:47.039
I can't remember why you refused to do it.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.221
And I said, well, would you mind telling me?

03:49.241 --> 03:50.082
I said, I'd be glad to.

03:50.622 --> 03:53.545
And I said, if you call again, I'll be glad to tell you the same thing.

03:54.526 --> 04:03.334
And we had that kind of relationship, you know, that you could, and as long as you could back what you had to say, he would accept it.

04:04.114 --> 04:07.017
I even called him, I told him one time, you don't dare

04:06.997 --> 04:13.948
give this man a course until you listen to why I think you shouldn't."

04:13.968 --> 04:19.056
And I said, he'll be down to see you and you don't dare speak to him before I speak to him.

04:19.076 --> 04:20.459
He said, well, come inside off.

04:21.180 --> 04:26.448
And so I went in and the man didn't get what he wanted because Maxwell was willing to listen.

04:27.370 --> 04:30.675
But I remember at one faculty meeting, I don't know whether you were there,

04:32.410 --> 04:45.202
They were having all the student uprisings at other schools, and he and Van Riper, who had come from situations where they had student problems, wanted to close and lock the doors.

04:45.602 --> 04:47.343
And I stood up and said, you can't do that.

04:48.264 --> 04:51.367
It's against fire laws and safety laws, I said.

04:52.128 --> 05:02.417
And then I told him I didn't think there was a problem, and if any students came and sat in on the meeting, they deserved what they got.

05:02.397 --> 05:06.105
Do you remember ever any class interruption?

05:07.047 --> 05:07.308
No.

05:08.210 --> 05:08.471
No.

05:08.992 --> 05:17.210
That was the same year, I think, when they marched on the school to the president's office to welcome him.

05:17.752 --> 05:21.520
And somebody gave him $10,000 or something like that.

05:21.500 --> 05:36.436
Now, the university, as it is growing, coeducation, racial integration, and so forth, the English department begins to grow.

05:36.536 --> 05:42.322
Describe how the department changed as you all began to have a broader program.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.469
Well, the...

05:49.765 --> 06:02.404
I think that the major change is that instead of a more congenial department, it's factionalized.

06:02.604 --> 06:11.538
They're little groups, and they're more unhappy people.

06:14.142 --> 06:18.388
I'm not saying that there was ever a time when everybody was happy.

06:20.512 --> 06:27.660
But as I said, 35 of my 37 and a half years were good years.

06:27.700 --> 06:31.705
They were years I enjoyed working and I put in some mighty long days.

06:31.885 --> 06:38.653
But a lot of those days were with people who enjoyed working and you enjoyed working with them.

06:38.673 --> 06:42.537
But I get the impression now that

06:43.664 --> 07:00.745
There are so many different kinds of pressures and so many different jealousies and so much infighting.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.057
It's not a happy place.

07:04.139 --> 07:16.920
Did you ever, as a faculty member or departmental administrator, ever have any kind of pressure to give an unearned grade to anybody?

07:19.063 --> 07:20.125
Yes, one time.

07:21.066 --> 07:26.395
I gave a man a failing grade.

07:28.113 --> 07:42.936
The dean of, I don't know, petroleum engineering or some engineering department wanted to change the grade.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.384
And they called and tried me.

07:48.404 --> 07:50.728
He was graduating senior or something.

07:51.468 --> 07:59.326
and they called and tried to get me to change the grade and I refused and then I heard that the grade had been changed.

08:01.130 --> 08:07.384
So I went down and tried to see the dean and he was busy and couldn't see me.

08:08.714 --> 08:19.185
And so I started yelling at the top of my lungs in the secretary's office, calling him all sorts of names and what a coward he was, not coming out to see me and so on.

08:19.906 --> 08:21.708
So I'm sure he heard what I had to say.

08:21.768 --> 08:29.977
And I wrote, I think, a letter about it, but I don't know whether anything was done but that.

08:30.978 --> 08:37.945
I remember early on when I was at Johnny Hayes.

08:38.195 --> 08:50.070
home one day and visiting, and two members of the athletic department came and tried to get him to change the grades for two football players.

08:51.132 --> 08:52.874
And he said, no, I can't do that.

08:53.194 --> 09:03.628
And then they abandoned the one fella and tried to get the other one, and he was an Indian, and he was .

09:04.908 --> 09:09.095
But they never got very far in that.

09:09.115 --> 09:15.787
But never any call from the president's office or the dean's office or a former student or a board member?

09:17.149 --> 09:17.570
No.

09:17.590 --> 09:19.093
And what about from athletics?

09:21.437 --> 09:27.287
Well, the only time I had any

09:30.203 --> 09:37.071
dealings with the athletic department about grades was when Jerry Claiborne was there, and they tried to keep on top of things.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.716
And they tried to anticipate problems.

09:43.137 --> 09:51.146
And it was not a pressure to change the grades under Bear Bryant.

09:51.327 --> 09:59.856
And Jerry, it was, what can we do to keep our students in line and get them passed?

10:00.933 --> 10:02.996
So I never had any trouble with him at all.

10:03.457 --> 10:08.924
Am I correct that Jerry Claiborne tactfully let people know that he was a Phi Beta Kappa member?

10:12.169 --> 10:19.279
Well, I found it out by accident myself when he lived right across the street for a while.

10:20.204 --> 10:31.899
And my one big laugh was when his wife, speaking to Billy Joe, said, your husband must be a brain.

10:31.919 --> 10:41.632
I thought, my God, her husband is a Phi Beta Kappa, and I never came close to that.

10:41.652 --> 10:42.593
She thought I was a brain.

10:42.613 --> 10:44.636
What did she think of her husband, for God's sake?

10:45.798 --> 10:47.680
But no, I don't know whether he...

10:47.660 --> 10:49.743
did it tactfully or otherwise.

10:50.123 --> 10:51.766
He never said that to me.

10:53.128 --> 11:02.200
As you look back over all those years, who deserves most credit for the progress that the English Department made?

11:09.751 --> 11:10.732
Well, that's hard to say.

11:13.937 --> 11:15.439
I think that

11:17.360 --> 11:25.311
Harry Hearth did a great job, but I think there.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.678
In the rank and file faculty, were there some outstanding teachers?

11:31.499 --> 11:31.900
Oh, yes.

11:31.980 --> 11:32.741
Who?

11:32.761 --> 11:36.185
From early on, we had some outstanding teachers.

11:37.928 --> 11:40.171
I thought Sam Southwell was a very good man.

11:40.271 --> 11:40.471
Who?

11:40.631 --> 11:41.613
Sam Southwell.

11:41.953 --> 11:42.414
Southwell.

11:42.875 --> 11:46.219
And, of course, again, Freddy Eckfeldt was a great teacher.

11:47.380 --> 11:57.591
And I think we've had quite a few good teachers and we've had quite a few bad teachers.

11:58.832 --> 12:00.274
I think it's like anything else.

12:01.195 --> 12:13.068
Some people are scholars and some people are scholar teachers and some are teachers and not scholars and you end up with a wide variety.

12:13.308 --> 12:14.890
Who were the outstanding scholars?

12:16.996 --> 12:29.060
Well, John Q. Anderson was supposedly one, but again, he had people, and I don't know how much jealousy was involved in it, but he did a great deal.

12:29.101 --> 12:32.808
I thought Sam Soth was a scholarly type.

12:32.868 --> 12:35.153
Nick Quick was a scholarly type.

12:36.075 --> 12:38.700
I'm not sure how much Nick wrote, but...

12:40.840 --> 12:54.158
As you look back, for you, share some satisfying moments, some times that you look back on with joy and pleasure.

12:57.543 --> 13:07.457
Well, there are so many things that I've enjoyed about the place.

13:08.378 --> 13:08.959
Yes.

13:08.979 --> 13:09.700
Describe those.

13:11.198 --> 13:14.401
Well, I enjoyed meeting my wife and getting married.

13:14.501 --> 13:22.550
That was a highlight of my years at A&M.

13:23.531 --> 13:28.516
I enjoyed the sort of fellowship that we used to have in the department.

13:29.797 --> 13:30.598
That was a big thing.

13:30.618 --> 13:34.522
We used to have meetings.

13:35.042 --> 13:38.826
It started out when we'd start to go for coffee.

13:40.544 --> 13:47.450
And they got more and more, and then we finally end up going out for dinner one night a month or so.

13:47.650 --> 14:03.603
And then when we got women teachers in here, some of the, it was sort of an all-male thing, and so some of the women teachers wanted to go because they thought they would get advancement by getting to be there.

14:03.624 --> 14:10.129
And then Lee Martin said he couldn't go anymore to the meetings as department head.

14:11.105 --> 14:13.388
if women were to admit it.

14:13.989 --> 14:26.826
And there were a few of the diehard men who had hated having women students who didn't want to admit women teachers, but most of us welcomed them.

14:26.846 --> 14:36.319
And then when they got so they could come and they found out how

14:38.189 --> 14:44.896
that there wasn't any, you weren't going to get any preferment for promotion or classes or anything like being there.

14:46.258 --> 14:53.105
And how dull some of the men could do, and what some of their ambitions were, see how many beer cans they could stack one upon the other.

14:55.408 --> 14:57.069
Which I thought was stupid myself.

14:57.670 --> 15:06.019
They quit coming, but they had achieved what they wanted, and I wasn't invited.

15:06.674 --> 15:10.398
of what are you most proud for those 37 years?

15:11.499 --> 15:16.104
Well, I'm proud of having never backed up to a pay table.

15:18.487 --> 15:32.462
I am proud of having earned my keep and being the first person in 38 years without a PhD to be appointed a full professor and then an emeritus professor.

15:33.823 --> 15:35.685
And in spite of the fact that

15:38.534 --> 15:52.144
The department head who put me forward didn't particularly like me because I told him when he said, after the first month of his headship, he said, you don't approve of me, do you?

15:53.066 --> 15:54.670
I said, no, I don't.

15:55.493 --> 15:57.215
And he said, would you mind telling me why?

15:57.235 --> 15:58.256
I said, I'd be glad to.

15:58.377 --> 16:00.779
I said, do you shoot from the hip?

16:00.799 --> 16:02.562
And he said, well, what do you mean by that?

16:02.702 --> 16:05.285
I said, well, you act and then you think.

16:06.206 --> 16:08.469
And I said, that's supposed to be the other way around.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.971
Oh, that flew all over him.

16:09.991 --> 16:14.756
And so ever after, as his administrative assistant, he would come to me.

16:14.817 --> 16:19.022
And if he was in deep trouble, he would come to my office.

16:19.142 --> 16:21.805
If he was only in minor trouble, he'd call me in.

16:21.785 --> 16:29.436
And so I could tell how much trouble he had, and he always prefaced his remarks with, you'll probably think I've been shooting from the hip again.

16:30.137 --> 16:32.541
And I would say you'd probably be right.

16:33.202 --> 16:35.265
I'll probably be right, and I was.

16:37.027 --> 16:42.375
But he was the one who put me forward as full professor in spite of all that.

16:44.498 --> 16:52.367
Let's see, did the students ever attempt any good bull pranks on you in class, out of class?

16:52.688 --> 16:52.968
No.

16:54.670 --> 17:11.130
My, one of the things I was proudest of was when I retired, that summer I had last classes were two of the best I ever had in speech.

17:13.557 --> 17:20.708
I love them and I think they like me and both classes gave me retirement parties and one gave me two parties.

17:24.934 --> 17:33.187
So I think that would highlight the fact that my students would give me retirement parties.

17:34.409 --> 17:37.894
Another highlight of my life was although I didn't teach graduate classes,

17:39.005 --> 17:47.294
My last year, the graduate students asked me to speak at their banquet.

17:47.434 --> 17:59.386
I like the fact that over the years, many departments and colleges asked me to be a banquet speaker or a lecture to them.

18:01.148 --> 18:05.012
Engineering school asked me to come over and talk to their

18:06.275 --> 18:10.364
They're graduate students about writing and speech.

18:12.248 --> 18:15.434
Your favorite course to teach?

18:16.837 --> 18:23.651
Well, at one time I would have thought it was creative writing, but I never had that many fine creative writing students.

18:23.672 --> 18:25.836
I always enjoyed teaching speech.

18:26.913 --> 18:32.362
I always said that the only problem with teaching speech is you had to listen.

18:34.565 --> 18:37.330
But I love to talk.

18:37.510 --> 18:54.237
The year I first sold three national magazines within a span of three months, I asked myself, do you want to be a full-time writer or do you want to be a writer who

18:55.718 --> 18:58.242
writes part-time and teaches.

18:59.144 --> 19:00.886
I had no trouble deciding.

19:00.906 --> 19:05.574
I had to be a teacher because I needed the association with people.

19:05.614 --> 19:07.096
I needed an audience.

19:09.961 --> 19:16.191
I always knew, I think, in the back of my mind growing up that I would be a teacher.

19:17.453 --> 19:21.462
I decided I wanted the association with people.

19:21.562 --> 19:26.052
And I think speech was probably my most satisfying thing.

19:26.072 --> 19:27.214
And I did learn to listen.

19:28.778 --> 19:29.038
All right.

19:29.058 --> 19:32.185
Now, I've about run out of the questions I had thought of in advance.

19:32.205 --> 19:35.833
What have we not covered that we should have?

19:39.104 --> 19:40.145
Oh, Pinky Downs.

19:44.010 --> 19:50.278
Pinky Downs was, of course, one of the world's great characters, and I always ask my speech students, why did you come to A&M?

19:51.659 --> 19:59.549
And one student said, well, I was hitchhiking on my way to Waco to go to school, where I was signed up.

19:59.569 --> 20:06.377
And he said, this little man in a white Ford picked me up, and I never got beyond the Eastgate.

20:06.357 --> 20:13.849
Were you here when we had the 75th anniversary of the college?

20:15.652 --> 20:16.854
Of the college?

20:16.954 --> 20:18.036
Yeah, of A&M.

20:18.597 --> 20:19.318
No, no.

20:22.443 --> 20:25.388
Because that would have been… I forget what year it was.

20:25.648 --> 20:27.471
That would have been 50…

20:29.476 --> 20:53.053
Well, I don't remember what year it was, but anyhow, each college had to present some kind of honoring of the 75th year, and so liberal arts decided to have something, and I was selected to decide what it would be and to do it.

20:55.953 --> 21:02.081
And so I couldn't think of anything offhand quickly that would represent the entire college.

21:02.161 --> 21:23.648
And so I read in the Houston Post about a man named Louis Lenz, who had attended all of the football games for 50 years or so without missing, except during the Warriors or something like that, and that he had a fabulous collection of Texana.

21:25.838 --> 21:31.613
So I thought, well, that would at least represent history and English.

21:33.176 --> 21:41.738
So I decided we would have an exhibit of his Texana in the

21:41.718 --> 21:45.868
And so I got their display cases allotted to me.

21:46.990 --> 21:52.763
And I called Louie and went down to see, got an appointment, went down to Houston and met him.

21:54.026 --> 21:56.993
And he said, well, he would, he would

21:56.973 --> 22:03.499
lend a collection so long as he could oversee the putting it and displaying it.

22:03.639 --> 22:04.539
I said, well, that's fine.

22:04.579 --> 22:05.760
I would prefer that.

22:06.741 --> 22:09.704
So he came up and he had heel spurs.

22:10.384 --> 22:26.338
He was sitting in a wheelchair and he was supervising by putting the books on display that we had chosen that would be representative of Texas and A&M and all.

22:28.090 --> 22:31.233
And Pinky Downs came in.

22:32.375 --> 22:41.625
And just before that, he had told me that he and Pinky were classmates and that they had sneaked out of chapel and out the window and so on and so forth.

22:41.805 --> 22:51.896
And so he greeted Pinky with open arms and they kissed one another on both cheeks and carried on in great style.

22:51.936 --> 22:53.397
Louie did most of the talking.

22:53.437 --> 22:57.962
So then after a while, a student asked

22:58.735 --> 23:06.635
Louie Lenz bought one of the books and he started talking and Pinky sidled up to me and he said, Who is this man?

23:08.099 --> 23:14.415
I said, Pinky, you don't remember Louie Lenz who was in your class.

23:14.682 --> 23:17.247
And you used to sneak out of chapel together.

23:17.267 --> 23:18.890
He said, well, what does he do?

23:19.010 --> 23:22.658
I said, well, he's just retired recently from the oil business.

23:22.818 --> 23:28.168
And they gave him a great retirement party in Houston.

23:28.249 --> 23:31.054
And I gave him a whole list of things.

23:32.890 --> 23:36.714
After the student turned away, Pinky said, Louie, old buddy.

23:39.297 --> 23:42.941
He said, didn't I read where you retired recently?

23:43.482 --> 23:44.483
Yes.

23:44.503 --> 23:46.225
Did they give you a big retirement book?

23:46.585 --> 23:53.112
And everything I had told Pinky, then he recited it to Louie.

23:53.573 --> 24:01.682
And Louie just ate it up that his old friend Pinky should know all about him and been following his career all these years.

24:01.662 --> 24:04.329
What a masterful snow job that was.

24:06.274 --> 24:10.083
That was one of the highlights of my life, seeing Pinky do that.

24:10.123 --> 24:11.587
Pinky was everywhere.

24:11.968 --> 24:15.958
What else do you have on your list that we should cover?

24:18.183 --> 24:20.507
Oh, you ask about the faculty.

24:20.608 --> 24:24.555
When I first came here, we had a lot of ABDs.

24:24.575 --> 24:25.817
We seemed to attract those.

24:25.837 --> 24:41.727
We also had a lot of people who had been lay preachers or connected with the ministry for one reason or another came here, either after retirement or being fired or giving up the cause.

24:41.707 --> 24:44.269
We had that.

24:44.389 --> 24:48.853
When I first came here, all you had to do was keep your nose clean.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.277
In four years you didn't have to publish.

24:52.517 --> 24:56.000
Publishing was nonexistent almost.

24:57.401 --> 25:03.427
Then in four years or four and a half years, five at the most, you would get promoted to the next rank.

25:05.769 --> 25:10.633
After a while,

25:10.883 --> 25:12.605
That didn't work.

25:12.665 --> 25:19.571
Then you had to have the terminal of the reason that it was publish or perish, and so things changed dramatically on that.

25:22.294 --> 25:25.517
We talked about blacks.

25:27.459 --> 25:32.784
We had several outstanding blacks, but we never had a very big percentage of blacks.

25:32.824 --> 25:37.549
I remember I was astounded at this.

25:38.002 --> 25:45.392
A young man who was black and, of all things, he was made president of the senior class.

25:45.593 --> 25:46.374
Student body.

25:46.574 --> 25:47.275
Student body, yeah.

25:47.295 --> 25:47.876
Fred McClure.

25:48.016 --> 25:48.737
Fred McClure.

25:48.837 --> 25:58.170
I mean, that was one of the proudest things I was of A&M, that here and this Hydebond School were

25:59.855 --> 26:05.443
So many people who would come out of prejudice would recognize this outstanding student.

26:06.544 --> 26:11.872
I had, there was another young woman I had as a student, black student girl.

26:12.512 --> 26:22.667
And when you came to class, all of the white students would be surrounding her because she was so attractive and charming and intelligent.

26:22.707 --> 26:28.815
They later made her, gave her some kind of a position with minorities on the campus.

26:29.352 --> 26:34.479
But that year when I had her as a student, I had another black student in class.

26:36.342 --> 26:39.607
And so he was sitting at the back of the room.

26:39.647 --> 26:40.909
He was a transfer student.

26:40.949 --> 26:43.252
And he was sitting at the back of the room, and he had his hat on.

26:45.736 --> 26:51.023
And so when I called a roll and got to Mr. Taylor, he answered.

26:51.063 --> 26:53.547
And I said, Mr. Taylor, would you please take your hat off?

26:56.351 --> 26:59.055
And he said, well, it's very important to me that I wear my hat.

27:00.892 --> 27:03.597
I said, well, it's very important to me that you take it off.

27:05.500 --> 27:18.903
So I finished calling the role and I said, now this is a speech class and one of the things that we hope to learn, or I hope you'll learn, is the ability to persuade.

27:21.547 --> 27:24.452
So I said, will you come up to the front of the room?

27:26.491 --> 27:36.745
and persuade me by what you say, why it is more important for you to wear your hat than it is for me for you to take it off.

27:38.647 --> 27:42.332
And so he got up to the front of the room and he said, well, I'm a transfer student.

27:43.794 --> 27:44.295
I'm black.

27:45.617 --> 27:46.558
Nobody knows me.

27:48.260 --> 27:55.610
And this is one way to set myself apart and identify myself.

27:56.230 --> 28:04.681
He said, now this young black lady, everybody knows and likes her, surrounds her, and I am totally ignored.

28:05.923 --> 28:07.125
I'm a minority.

28:07.966 --> 28:12.932
And he said, this is something that sets me apart and it's important to me.

28:15.435 --> 28:18.199
So I said, well, you have persuaded me.

28:19.377 --> 28:28.481
I said, I want you to know you can wear your hat, and I want you to know that there'll be no penalty to it on my part.

28:29.403 --> 28:35.479
I said, if you continue to speak as you spoke just now, I'll guarantee you an end of course.

28:37.889 --> 28:41.933
So the next day, it was a summer class and we met every day.

28:42.714 --> 28:45.396
The next day he came to class and he didn't wear his hat.

28:46.717 --> 28:50.121
I said, Mr. Taylor, you're not wearing your hat.

28:51.182 --> 28:56.226
I said, I hope you don't think that you're going to be punished in any way for it.

28:58.609 --> 29:04.234
He said, well, I've thought about it and I've decided it wasn't that important.

29:04.568 --> 29:12.419
I said, well, you're obviously a young man who is capable of great education.

29:12.439 --> 29:12.920
That's good.

29:12.960 --> 29:13.721
That's good.

29:15.223 --> 29:15.644
What else?

29:22.814 --> 29:28.602
Well, I remember the time that I bought the bonfire, my first bonfire.

29:29.594 --> 29:38.227
I was horrified by the thought that if this fell and we're in such a cramped space, I'll be trampled to death.

29:39.109 --> 29:45.038
It was across the street from the YMCA in a confined space.

29:46.480 --> 29:54.252
So I never went back after that, and then we had the time that was bombed by or dived at by this

29:54.839 --> 30:03.988
A plane had exploded and over a block away you'd find the engine in different parts and that horrified them.

30:05.538 --> 30:18.423
wrote a satire on the bonfire in which I suggested that instead of having all of this labor go up in flames, I suggested we build Disneyland on the Brazos.

30:19.845 --> 30:25.977
Using all of this labor, all of this wood, we would recreate the San Jacinto Monument.

30:25.957 --> 30:29.782
the Alamo, and so on and so forth.

30:30.463 --> 30:38.833
And we would charge admission and make money and buy us a damn good coach and a football team, professional football team.

30:39.554 --> 30:51.189
And so I gave that to Carl Almquist, who was editor of the former Student Association paper.

30:52.050 --> 30:54.613
And I said, you can publish this if you like.

30:54.593 --> 30:58.097
And he read it and he said, well, I'm going to do us both a favor.

30:58.978 --> 31:03.223
He said, I'm not going to print it.

31:03.243 --> 31:08.710
He said, if this were printed, they'd ride you out of town on a rail.

31:08.730 --> 31:11.073
Then they'd put the rail on the bonfire and you would.

31:12.755 --> 31:13.696
That's about all I had.

31:15.318 --> 31:16.339
Okay.

31:17.781 --> 31:19.723
I have just two or three left then.

31:20.395 --> 31:27.688
Let's make believe that you are now selected as the consultant
