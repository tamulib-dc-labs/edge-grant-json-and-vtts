WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:06.188
Master's degree and we had a Ph.D.

00:06.228 --> 00:09.997
in business I think at that time.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.603
It wasn't long.

00:12.783 --> 00:16.472
I'm almost sure we had, they didn't have a Ph.D.

00:16.512 --> 00:17.053
in marketing.

00:17.554 --> 00:18.075
We had a Ph.D.

00:18.116 --> 00:18.436
in business.

00:18.456 --> 00:19.559
We eventually had a Ph.D.

00:19.599 --> 00:20.942
in marketing probably.

00:21.327 --> 00:27.352
in the, by mid-'70s or so, late-'70s, and began to turn out our own PhDs in marketing.

00:27.372 --> 00:31.836
Do you remember when you all began, when you began to deal with some graduate students?

00:31.856 --> 00:37.842
Oh, I dealt with those and began teaching graduate classes probably in 1970 or 71.

00:38.042 --> 00:41.605
Because we had, we'd offered graduate classes.

00:42.126 --> 00:45.589
It was just whether or not we offered, we had an MS.

00:45.669 --> 00:48.732
There was an MS program out there, an MS in marketing.

00:48.852 --> 00:50.173
And they could major in marketing.

00:50.193 --> 00:51.334
Yeah, yeah.

00:51.314 --> 01:01.614
In those years, where did the products of the marketing department, the undergraduate, where were they primarily?

01:01.634 --> 01:03.838
Oh, they were going over to the small teacher schools, I think.

01:04.039 --> 01:07.385
One went up to Baylor and one went over to Huntsville.

01:08.066 --> 01:09.249
That's the graduate program?

01:09.269 --> 01:10.231
That's in the PhD.

01:10.711 --> 01:12.034
That's the PhD kids.

01:12.535 --> 01:14.098
Kids went over there.

01:14.956 --> 01:17.501
Where did the undergraduates and the masters go?

01:17.521 --> 01:19.586
Oh, they go in the typical places.

01:19.606 --> 01:35.479
They, you know, they were going with the Procter & Gamble's, and they were going, excuse me, the Ralston Perrinas, and they were going with the IBM's, and they were going with the Sears Roebuck, and some going with Wallace's Prenny, and some going, you know, mom and dad shows.

01:35.459 --> 01:48.561
But we were not having a lot of people down here like you have now chasing after our kids where, you know, we're going to have a career fair here in four weeks and there will be 200 firms down here looking for our graduates.

01:48.661 --> 01:52.929
How did the student and the company make the connection then?

01:52.949 --> 01:54.852
Well, Herb Thompson did a lot of that.

01:55.810 --> 02:03.722
Herb Thompson, if he found a kid who hadn't got a job and he liked the kid, Herb would get on the phone.

02:03.822 --> 02:07.968
And he'd call somebody to somebody and says, you know, I need you to take a look at this kid.

02:08.469 --> 02:13.156
All right, did the others, did the youngsters make the connections themselves?

02:13.457 --> 02:13.857
A lot of it.

02:14.138 --> 02:17.102
We had, I guess, a career center here.

02:17.203 --> 02:18.825
I don't know too much about it.

02:18.845 --> 02:19.706
It had a few people.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.010
But it was pretty lightweight.

02:22.030 --> 02:23.472
Nothing like it is now.

02:23.452 --> 02:28.159
When did you begin to think that A&M began to play in the big leagues?

02:28.419 --> 02:32.325
Oh probably when Bill Mewes came in.

02:34.568 --> 02:40.397
John had to leave, not had to leave, I don't mean him like that, but when John left and Bill Mewes came in.

02:40.437 --> 02:46.185
Bill Mewes was a, and John took us I think as far as we could go.

02:46.283 --> 02:52.975
And Bill came in, management by objectives, very goal.

02:53.456 --> 02:55.840
Now we sat down and wrote a mission statement.

02:56.201 --> 02:58.284
Now we sat down and said, where do we want to go?

02:58.585 --> 02:59.767
How are we going to get there?

03:00.248 --> 03:01.670
How many people are you going to need?

03:02.752 --> 03:09.304
Describe this fellow, Bill Meuse.

03:09.976 --> 03:11.701
My impression is quite serious.

03:13.706 --> 03:23.833
He and I were very good friends and you would not see the light side of him until you got him out from behind his Dean's desk.

03:24.708 --> 03:26.511
He came from?

03:27.032 --> 03:29.676
He came from Omaha, I believe.

03:30.037 --> 03:32.521
That's right, University of Nebraska.

03:32.761 --> 03:41.375
Nebraska of Omaha, and prior to that had been over at Boone State or Appalachian State in Boone.

03:41.536 --> 03:43.639
Western North Carolina.

03:43.900 --> 03:44.881
Boone, North Carolina.

03:46.063 --> 03:50.310
And came in, and I hadn't met him at all until

03:50.898 --> 03:57.364
He, you know, was, came onto this job and

03:58.475 --> 04:15.001
Earl Bennett was kind of the associate dean, and I was department head, and we would have regular meetings, and we would meet for an hour, an hour, and we were off and going.

04:15.241 --> 04:18.446
What were those meetings, what was the theme of those meetings?

04:18.466 --> 04:26.659
The theme, well there was an agenda, and the theme of those meetings was each department got the report, what was happening,

04:27.078 --> 04:53.170
any problems they had with enrollments or we didn't talk budget or funds that was you know only at the time that it took to do that but you sure didn't take out oh last year's budget and add five percent and use the same words again because he had a different method for that and he wanted you had a one-on-one discussion with him about your particular department and your faculty

04:53.656 --> 05:01.983
And you talked to, it was, for lack of a better term, more business-like.

05:02.464 --> 05:02.904
Structured.

05:03.265 --> 05:12.713
Am I correct in understanding you are inferring to me that John Pearson in Huttensight was the right man for this place at that time?

05:12.873 --> 05:13.834
Absolutely, I think.

05:13.874 --> 05:17.177
And then Bill Mewes was the right person?

05:18.038 --> 05:18.198
Yeah.

05:19.599 --> 05:23.663
You know, John, if you look at it, John is pretty much a political animal, I thought.

05:23.643 --> 05:31.911
And as you know that he liked to play poker with some of his old cronies, and they'd play every so often.

05:31.991 --> 05:38.017
I think Calhoun was in on this, and I don't know if Mack was in on this or not, but it might have been.

05:38.057 --> 05:38.598
There were several.

05:39.238 --> 05:46.966
Then Winerti was in there, and there was either a Monday night or a Tuesday night, once a month or whenever, and they would sit and play poker.

05:46.986 --> 05:49.228
And there was probably a lot of discussion.

05:49.208 --> 05:50.071
going on that.

05:50.593 --> 05:52.881
Or at least a lot of ideas planted.

05:52.921 --> 06:00.889
And I just think that a lot got done on that side of it.

06:01.291 --> 06:12.129
Now, with Muse, do you remember there being an appropriate amount of faculty and involvement in the dean search?

06:13.792 --> 06:14.673
There may have been.

06:14.713 --> 06:15.454
There probably was.

06:15.574 --> 06:17.417
I wasn't, I don't recall.

06:17.438 --> 06:26.893
As far as you're aware, though, was the selection process a positive factor in his entry?

06:27.177 --> 06:28.902
He didn't have anything to undo.

06:29.142 --> 06:33.093
No, I don't think there was, no, no, there was nothing to undo.

06:33.655 --> 06:43.060
And he came in and he was very positive and he did one other thing, or someone did, he hired Bill Mobley.

06:43.445 --> 06:50.258
And Bill Mowgli, I was department head of management, I mean marketing, and Bill Mowgli was department head of management.

06:50.499 --> 06:52.282
What were your first impressions of him?

06:52.302 --> 06:52.883
Oh, I liked Bill.

06:53.204 --> 06:53.865
I liked Bill Mowgli.

06:53.885 --> 06:54.727
Where did he come from?

06:54.747 --> 06:55.167
Do you remember?

06:55.248 --> 07:00.878
Bill came, uh, no, I can't remember.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.241
I can't remember.

07:02.381 --> 07:05.908
But he, South Carolina maybe, or somewhere like that.

07:05.888 --> 07:12.237
He had been with Pittsburgh Plate and Gas, but I can't recall, I think he'd come from the South somewhere.

07:12.678 --> 07:18.467
He went to Denton, Denison in Ohio as an undergraduate.

07:19.067 --> 07:31.626
And he had been with the human resource people, was a good scholar, and really a fun guy to work with and later to work for.

07:31.606 --> 07:33.411
And he was one of your colleagues.

07:33.712 --> 07:35.296
He was your... He was a peer of mine.

07:35.317 --> 07:36.540
That's what I mean.

07:36.580 --> 07:44.282
And then he... Bill asked me

07:45.578 --> 07:52.373
to say I came in and stepped in as interim associate dean knowing that I wasn't going to be associate dean.

07:53.956 --> 07:56.421
And Bill didn't have plans for me for that.

07:56.482 --> 08:01.793
But he asked me what I would like to run, and I said I'd like to run the undergraduate programs.

08:02.114 --> 08:03.216
And he said fine.

08:03.196 --> 08:04.699
Now this is under Bill?

08:04.919 --> 08:05.240
Muse.

08:05.521 --> 08:06.022
Muse.

08:06.042 --> 08:06.483
Muse.

08:06.543 --> 08:08.907
And then Bill Mobley became associate dean.

08:09.689 --> 08:16.362
And so the executive committee then, and a guy by the name of Lyle Schoenfeld took over as head of the management department.

08:17.101 --> 08:24.012
And we hired a guy by the name of John Dinkle about that time, came in to help turn Banner around.

08:26.876 --> 08:28.138
That's business analysis.

08:28.318 --> 08:29.380
Business analysis.

08:29.761 --> 08:38.374
And Lyle Schoenfeld took over Bill Mobley's plot as head of the management department.

08:38.414 --> 08:40.257
What about accounting in those days?

08:40.507 --> 08:41.769
Accounting's always been strong.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.451
I can't recall who was department.

08:43.491 --> 08:45.374
I've probably been Jim Benjamin.

08:45.675 --> 08:48.859
He's been around a long time, but Gary Shugart was before him.

08:50.562 --> 09:00.456
And Strausser was always smart enough not to be department head, and I was associate dean with John Pearson, but I don't think he ever wanted to be department head.

09:01.457 --> 09:08.708
Under Bill Mewes, were y'all, did he expect you to be the department head

09:10.021 --> 09:15.229
to run things, are the department chairman to- No, no.

09:16.491 --> 09:22.321
We were department heads, and we were to solve our problems.

09:22.341 --> 09:32.677
And of course, most of us, Mobley and myself, and I can't say about the others, but Mobley and I were pretty open.

09:33.298 --> 09:37.024
You know, there may have been others that said, you're going to do it this way.

09:37.004 --> 09:40.409
But Clint Phillips was over in finance at one time.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.512
Of course, Clint moved out and then moved up.

09:43.975 --> 09:47.300
And I can't recall who overtook over the finance department.

09:47.320 --> 09:47.660
Oh, I know.

09:47.781 --> 09:51.987
The guy that ran the Center for Enterprise.

09:52.027 --> 09:52.307
Bill.

09:52.508 --> 09:52.848
No, no.

09:53.890 --> 09:54.711
We'll think about that.

09:54.771 --> 10:00.480
But followed John Allen over there at Center for Free Enterprise.

10:00.460 --> 10:03.770
And y'all, when did y'all move to a new location?

10:03.790 --> 10:07.883
We moved in 1980 over to Blocker Building.

10:07.903 --> 10:09.709
So you stayed in Francis?

10:10.411 --> 10:13.862
We stayed in Francis till 1980 and then in 1980,

10:14.838 --> 10:18.344
or 81, we moved over to Blocker.

10:18.925 --> 10:32.046
And there's an interesting story, you may or may not recall, and I think you do, is that, and Jack Williams was president, they put a moratorium on buildings at that year and said Texas A&M can't have any more buildings.

10:33.308 --> 10:35.952
Well, they didn't define the size of the building.

10:36.809 --> 10:49.221
So it's my understanding that the College of Business is supposed to have a building dimensions of X, Y, Z. It now had an X squared, Y squared, and Z squared, and we just made it bigger.

10:49.902 --> 10:53.525
And so we called it the Academic and Administration.

10:53.625 --> 10:54.646
We called it the ANA.

10:55.207 --> 11:06.057
Now the community, the girls, I mean with the girls here, they got a different nomenclature than the ANAs.

11:06.323 --> 11:07.765
creativity and thought.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.548
But we were over at Blocker then until 95.

11:11.849 --> 11:16.094
And then we came over here on the campus.

11:16.114 --> 11:25.485
Can you give some other examples of the quality of leadership under Mews and then Mobley?

11:26.507 --> 11:33.715
Well, I was always impressed with Bill Mews.

11:34.150 --> 11:49.527
he I think he he set out a five-year goal plan oh and uh uh Don Hellriggle was hired I think after somewhere along and Don was stepped in and out from time to time but Don

11:49.507 --> 11:57.961
Don, a real organizer, and Hellriegel with Muse and Mobley.

11:58.722 --> 12:10.401
I think the three of those, those three heads, guys, those three heads together, and with Muse giving the leadership, began to set out.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.684
We tried to work more with engineering.

12:12.724 --> 12:17.290
We tried to identify our own honors program people.

12:17.691 --> 12:26.042
We began to put in this thing when Lyle Schoenfeld came in and Bill Mobley was associate dean and Bill Mews was the dean.

12:26.062 --> 12:28.485
We put in the CBA fellows program.

12:29.286 --> 12:40.000
We began to take our better talent and polish it so that we could parade it to the Arthur Andersons and the Marwick and Mitchells and the Big 12 at that time or the Big 8.

12:40.503 --> 12:46.630
And we introduced the career fair for the first time under Bill Mews.

12:47.652 --> 12:52.538
I think we may have had 20 firms here that first year, and now this year we're going to have 200 here.

12:52.578 --> 12:55.802
And it's all done by the kids.

12:56.182 --> 12:57.944
There are no faculty out there hustling.

12:58.565 --> 13:00.007
So he put a lot of energy.

13:00.107 --> 13:04.452
I mean, he created a lot of energy among the faculty.

13:04.938 --> 13:10.926
Were there some corporations or outside organizations that became important allies in these?

13:11.006 --> 13:12.648
Well, he put together an advisory committee.

13:13.770 --> 13:24.564
And Bob Allen, who's now, I don't know if Bob's chairman of the regents now, but Bob was on our original one.

13:26.607 --> 13:28.329
Former mayor of Fort Worth up there.

13:28.589 --> 13:33.696
Wiley was on here.

13:33.676 --> 14:00.460
I can't recall some of them but we all had he went out and got big names to help us get some visibility and he would meet with them twice a year and with that group twice a year plus I'm sure he made individual calls on them trying to hustle and tried to ratchet up the Center for Executive Development and brought in a guy

14:01.756 --> 14:02.717
What's Winnie's name?

14:02.737 --> 14:03.438
Sings in the choir.

14:03.478 --> 14:06.061
Bob, she sings in the choir.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.165
Her husband died, and I should know because he's a teak.

14:10.206 --> 14:11.407
You don't mean Van Arsdale.

14:11.427 --> 14:11.968
No, no, no.

14:12.308 --> 14:12.929
Winnie.

14:13.870 --> 14:14.912
You don't mean Poirier.

14:14.932 --> 14:16.774
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:16.794 --> 14:19.257
I'm talking about in talk on my mind.

14:19.757 --> 14:20.638
Bob?

14:20.658 --> 14:21.019
Nelson.

14:21.639 --> 14:22.120
Oh.

14:22.140 --> 14:25.003
Winnie Nelson, who sings in the choir there in the church.

14:25.023 --> 14:28.928
Bob Nelson was brought in from the University of Illinois to help

14:28.908 --> 14:31.491
you know, ratchet up the CED program.

14:31.911 --> 14:41.943
We began to work with Skip Porter over in engineering, trying to do some entrepreneur adventurer's stuff, taking their patents and seeing what we could do with it.

14:42.263 --> 14:49.391
Continue to work through that Sea Grant program as much as we could doing things.

14:49.491 --> 14:52.114
I continued to work through the Sea Grant program.

14:52.094 --> 15:00.285
And, as you know, then Bill moved up and Mobley stepped in.

15:02.648 --> 15:06.212
Were there any differences in the style of the two?

15:06.232 --> 15:13.782
Not really, except, you know, Bill Mews being, coming out of a, really, he's

15:14.386 --> 15:20.752
He's less of a marketing man than he is a management by objectives man in a very, very systematic style.

15:21.873 --> 15:41.271
Bill Mobley seemed to have a much more openness to him and always wanted to make sure that you felt welcome in his office.

15:41.251 --> 15:49.143
And probably Bill Mewes might say, Sam, I don't want you doing that anymore.

15:50.024 --> 15:53.789
Bill Mewes might say, Sam, you ought to consider whether you want to stop doing that.

15:54.290 --> 15:55.251
You should be doing that.

15:55.752 --> 16:04.525
And both ways were acceptable to me because I understood where the authority lied, but it was a little bit different approach.

16:04.505 --> 16:12.667
And although neither was a Texan, neither had gone to school in this day, they both adapted well, did they not?

16:12.908 --> 16:18.463
Yeah, well, you know, Muses from Natchitoches, Louisiana,

16:19.793 --> 16:20.754
I'd forgotten that.

16:20.834 --> 16:21.895
That's where he went to school.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.857
So he was far removed.

16:25.478 --> 16:28.721
Northwestern Louisiana State or Natchitoches.

16:29.642 --> 16:41.272
So I think he considers himself much more Southern than, but yeah, they both acclimated this institute and both of them were great for our college.

16:42.013 --> 16:48.298
And what was good is that I thought Mobley just took off running

16:49.409 --> 16:52.994
after Bill Mewes left.

16:53.675 --> 16:55.918
I don't think there was a heartbeat skip.

16:56.459 --> 17:01.966
You know and then we had the interim dean for a while and then Benton came and Benton comes out of another place.

17:01.986 --> 17:02.887
Now Benton's Texan.

17:04.429 --> 17:14.803
And Benton came to us from Provost at former dean and then Provost at Houston and came here and has done an extremely good job.

17:14.883 --> 17:18.268
Back under the two bills, do you remember any

17:19.143 --> 17:23.609
thing that they tried to do that didn't get done?

17:23.629 --> 17:25.531
Do you remember any frustrations?

17:25.651 --> 17:30.237
Oh, I think they all, yeah, I think they were, we've all had a frustration at the Center for Economic Development.

17:30.257 --> 17:35.363
I mean, Center for, yeah, Center for Executive Development, I mean.

17:35.964 --> 17:38.808
Just can't, we just can't quite sell that to the state of Texas.

17:39.629 --> 17:41.191
University of Texas does a good job.

17:41.211 --> 17:44.174
They got a, you know, program over there.

17:45.416 --> 17:47.198
Dallas is easier because of the access.

17:47.218 --> 17:48.660
You know, it's pretty hard to bring

17:49.315 --> 17:57.011
this program and so we've got an executive development program, executive development program here and then we got an executive MBA but we don't teach it here.

17:57.773 --> 17:58.855
We teach it at the Woodlands.

17:59.617 --> 18:03.685
We realized you got to go to, you got to go to your market to get them because of those guys.

18:04.808 --> 18:10.159
So it took us a while to straighten that out and we'll put together a good EMBA program.

18:10.139 --> 18:16.872
I can't think of anything that probably fell on its face.

18:16.932 --> 18:25.549
Some of the things that we did with engineering just didn't quite—those entrepreneurial programs were pretty light.

18:26.035 --> 18:37.273
Now, and during, in the 70s and 80s, with whom did you and your colleagues in business, who did you kind of keep a watch on to see how A&M was comparing?

18:38.014 --> 18:38.996
Who were the comparators?

18:39.016 --> 18:42.161
Well, you always would want to compare it against the Big Ten.

18:42.782 --> 18:43.023
Okay.

18:44.425 --> 18:52.498
I don't think we ever got ourselves to where we would compare with, you know, the private schools, the Stanford's and the Harvard's and the Chicago's.

18:52.478 --> 18:57.844
If we could get somebody out of those programs, we had a feather in the cab.

18:57.925 --> 19:09.218
I think any time, back when Pearson was here, any time we got anybody out of the Big Ten, that was Bob Page, who I roomed with, came out of Indiana that year in 68, and I'd come from Illinois.

19:09.779 --> 19:12.021
Barbara Cole had come from Northwestern the year before.

19:15.866 --> 19:18.469
But there, you know...

19:18.449 --> 19:21.534
It's kind of hard, you know.

19:21.554 --> 19:32.231
In those days, it was just awfully hard to get people out of those major schools, particularly private schools.

19:32.392 --> 19:35.918
And the enrollment in the classes was exploding?

19:35.938 --> 19:37.841
Growing, growing, growing.

19:37.881 --> 19:38.983
We just needed more space.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.525
They needed more faculty space.

19:41.332 --> 19:46.340
If you look at our Wehner building here, room 159 holds 450.

19:46.380 --> 19:51.809
The biggest room in Blocker was room 101 held 260.

19:52.049 --> 19:57.518
And go back to Francis 202 held about 120.

19:59.236 --> 20:06.407
And then from 120, you went down to the 30s in Francis Hall.

20:07.288 --> 20:12.336
You might go over to Scotes and that big old auditorium there, teach a class in there.

20:12.356 --> 20:15.721
But we didn't have a need for that Scotes or the chemistry.

20:15.921 --> 20:18.004
We didn't have an accounting mayor, but we didn't.

20:18.423 --> 20:31.060
But we outgrew Bakker and we're, I don't know if we, I'm teaching, we've got two marketing courses for beginning marketing, one for the non-business, one for the business.

20:31.080 --> 20:40.532
We got 470, 420 in one and 450 or 60 in another one.

20:40.799 --> 20:46.167
All right, now, back there when you became department head, did you cease your teaching or?

20:46.227 --> 20:50.814
Yes and no, probably did.

20:50.954 --> 20:54.599
I looked, but if I was short of faculty, I probably came in, you know.

20:55.461 --> 20:56.522
I was still doing Sea Grant.

20:57.303 --> 20:59.847
I, you know, have program rule travel.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.872
I was traveling all over the United States, still doing that.

21:02.972 --> 21:05.035
And part of the reason was I did it.

21:05.155 --> 21:06.918
I don't think my faculty appreciated it.

21:06.938 --> 21:08.460
I probably wasn't a very good department head.

21:08.980 --> 21:14.532
Because I was a half-time C grader.

21:18.099 --> 21:21.927
Now what that meant, and my faculty didn't realize, that meant summer teaching money

21:23.847 --> 21:51.137
for my faculty because I get and so I they didn't quite realize they just didn't see me you know didn't see me there because I was half-time Sea Grant and so I wouldn't teach in the summer or maybe I wouldn't teach in the summer and I might teach something in the fall have a class but golly and then those guys wondered where we'd get the money for them to teach in the summer well where they got the money in teaching in the summer and their graduate assistant money was Sam Gillespie had about a hundred and forty thousand dollars worth of Sea Grant money

21:51.455 --> 22:00.649
During your times as department head, what were the biggest difficulties you had in trying to get money for something you needed?

22:01.590 --> 22:03.854
No, I didn't have to try that.

22:04.334 --> 22:05.456
We didn't have that many needs.

22:05.636 --> 22:08.220
You know, it had to be salary money.

22:08.961 --> 22:17.935
And with what I was doing with half, while we had a little bit of graduate assistant money and what I was doing with a half of my salary,

22:17.915 --> 22:20.679
We could go, we could get down the road quite a way.

22:20.799 --> 22:24.184
I didn't have that problem like the guys have to get a lab or anything like that.

22:24.224 --> 22:32.195
Describe your style as department head in evaluating faculty and in any feedback.

22:32.375 --> 22:36.400
How did you let them know what your recommendations were going to be?

22:37.562 --> 22:46.234
I, John, it was very clear John wanted a research track record because that's how you're going to get your students.

22:46.298 --> 22:52.427
When I came in as department head, there wasn't much being done, a lot of publications.

22:52.487 --> 23:04.965
So my first year, I sat down, and I had teaching, research, and service, and I had a little criteria, and I put all our faculty on that.

23:06.207 --> 23:10.433
And then I looked at my salaries and said, what are these guys worth?

23:10.854 --> 23:11.715
What are these guys getting?

23:13.349 --> 23:16.574
And one year I gave John's salary money back.

23:16.795 --> 23:20.140
I bet there's not anybody that ever gave money back.

23:20.381 --> 23:22.985
And I went to John and I said, I don't think these guys are producing.

23:24.427 --> 23:27.192
And I went to my faculty and I said, I turn money back.

23:28.174 --> 23:32.681
Because you guys are, the next year I had one guy had six pubs.

23:34.404 --> 23:39.272
I had another guy had three pubs plus another eight out on the street.

23:40.518 --> 24:03.893
and between and that year which between 75 and 78 if you would look at what came out and got published in 79 and 80 and 81 out of that effort the Department of Marketing probably out published most other schools in the country probably one of the top 10 producers in those five years and why was it because you didn't pay them now you're going to pay them

24:04.227 --> 24:08.853
You tell them, you pay, and they understood what the bottom line was and the publications came.

24:11.056 --> 24:25.054
And once they got into that, once they got into the publication site, it became natural for them because they could get their graduate students and they could get their research and they could get stuff out.

24:25.405 --> 24:26.487
I felt good about that.

24:26.527 --> 24:30.857
I'm not sure that they felt good about that, but I felt good about doing that and would kind of chuckle.

24:31.979 --> 24:40.979
There was one professor, one guy who was an associate professor, could never get promoted to full.

24:40.999 --> 24:45.709
And I'm not sure that he and John Pearson were on the best relationships.

24:46.499 --> 24:54.420
And one time we were up, and I can remember before we were up in this little room at the executive committee.

24:54.440 --> 25:00.696
We were going through promotion and tenure.

25:00.836 --> 25:02.280
And we'd go down the alphabet.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.236
And marketing's last.

25:06.819 --> 25:17.832
And so it got to me and I put up who was going to go up for tenure and maybe pay raises or whatever it was.

25:17.912 --> 25:20.755
But, and he said, I guess that is.

25:20.775 --> 25:22.978
And I said, no, no, we got one other one.

25:22.998 --> 25:23.618
I said, what is it?

25:23.638 --> 25:25.501
And I said, well, I want to put up this professor.

25:27.142 --> 25:29.645
And John got up and left and he says, I'm not going to support him.

25:29.685 --> 25:31.187
You guys can talk about him all you want.

25:33.817 --> 25:36.040
And I didn't get a pay raise that year.

25:38.443 --> 25:39.485
Everybody else got a pay raise.

25:39.525 --> 25:42.549
I mean we're talking about 10% pay raise.

25:42.569 --> 25:43.410
I didn't get a pay raise.

25:44.992 --> 25:45.913
John called me in.

25:45.933 --> 25:54.224
He said, Sam, you know, I give people merit raises based on my perceptions of how they run the department.

25:55.986 --> 26:01.714
You made a bad decision putting these guys up, and the reason you didn't get a pay raise is because you did that.

26:02.386 --> 26:03.749
And I said, I understand.

26:06.155 --> 26:14.775
And so the next year, the guy wanted to go up and I said, I can't afford to put you up.

26:16.898 --> 26:20.302
I just, I just took a hickey for you last year.

26:20.322 --> 26:22.004
I'm not going to do it again this year.

26:22.565 --> 26:28.912
And John, bless his heart, John and I, up until his death, still chuckled about that, because I understood.

26:28.952 --> 26:31.835
And it was very clear why he didn't.

26:32.476 --> 26:33.918
He didn't, not that he didn't like me.

26:33.998 --> 26:34.559
He liked me.

26:34.679 --> 26:38.984
I know John liked me, he says, but I, I can't, I can't do that.

26:39.865 --> 26:40.686
All right.

26:40.706 --> 26:46.112
During that period that you, when you were department head, how did you evaluate teaching quality?

26:46.767 --> 26:49.890
We didn't have teacher evaluations.

26:51.012 --> 26:52.974
Well, how did you?

26:53.214 --> 26:56.358
As department head, you heard enough of it coming over the transom.

26:57.599 --> 26:58.800
And we didn't have bad teachers.

26:59.201 --> 26:59.761
We really didn't.

26:59.882 --> 27:02.645
Herb Thompson did a, I mean, he had the guys in their pocket.

27:02.665 --> 27:05.147
Barbara Coe Davis did a great job.

27:06.289 --> 27:08.031
I did a reasonably good job, I guess.

27:08.111 --> 27:10.253
And then Jim in those days was doing a pretty good job.

27:11.214 --> 27:12.255
And you mentioned service.

27:12.335 --> 27:13.557
What was service?

27:14.958 --> 27:16.420
I don't know.

27:17.176 --> 27:30.349
You know, you look at are they attending the meetings, you know, professional meetings, are they on committees, are they reviewing papers for the conferences, what are they doing at the university level?

27:30.609 --> 27:37.916
For example, when, you know, I was on your centennial committee there, I'm sure that was considered a service piece.

27:39.117 --> 27:44.803
Then under Bill Mewes and then Bill Mobley,

27:44.783 --> 27:49.832
Did the same kinds of measurements continue?

27:51.234 --> 27:52.376
Yeah, but more formalized.

27:53.037 --> 27:53.137
Okay.

27:53.157 --> 27:54.079
They were formalized.

27:54.359 --> 27:55.421
Was that better, you think?

27:56.243 --> 27:57.325
Yeah, I think so.

27:57.385 --> 28:08.023
There was a paper trail and we began to keep a folder and a dossier because as you become bigger you probably have more problems.

28:08.527 --> 28:19.391
Were the, as you look back, were there some examples where some people were found wanting that deserved not to be?

28:19.411 --> 28:21.255
Oh, yeah.

28:21.275 --> 28:25.624
Yes, and there were people that probably deserved being terminated.

28:25.604 --> 28:29.392
for reasons other than lack of research.

28:31.637 --> 28:41.217
There were some people whose behavior was questionable with students or with other faculty.

28:41.197 --> 28:42.718
And so you had to.

28:43.299 --> 28:46.862
Unless you had the documentation, you couldn't do anything.

28:46.902 --> 28:51.326
And were there some people who were terminated for appropriate cause?

28:51.346 --> 28:52.547
Yeah, for appropriate cause.

28:54.168 --> 28:59.533
And it took, but you had, I think we just learned over time and grew with it.

29:00.093 --> 29:05.458
I'm not sure, I think had John Pearson stayed on, he probably would have realized he needed that.

29:06.579 --> 29:11.203
But, you know, back in those days, you know, I was at kind of an end of an era.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.087
and the beginning of another one.

29:13.708 --> 29:20.902
And the old rudder way was, damn it, Highway 6 runs both north and south, as you know.

29:21.302 --> 29:22.986
Whereas the other way, it was process.

29:23.767 --> 29:25.490
Process was very important to Mobley.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.075
Process, due process.

29:28.116 --> 29:30.981
Process was very, very important to Mobley.

29:30.961 --> 29:34.766
I think that was because of corporate and being a human resource man.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.209
You praised Williams a while ago.

29:37.249 --> 29:40.113
What about Calhoun as last president, as chief academic officer?

29:40.173 --> 29:41.615
Oh, yeah, I always liked him.

29:41.975 --> 29:44.118
You know, I didn't know too much about him, but I always liked John.

29:48.764 --> 29:53.610
And I don't know much about his personal life.

29:54.603 --> 30:01.238
I think, again, I was one of his more favorite people because of the notoriety I brought Sea Grant.

30:01.825 --> 30:05.890
I was able to get things from a guy by the name of Bob Abel.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.794
Bob Abel ran the C Group program in Washington.

30:09.816 --> 30:21.351
Bob Abel happened to be at a program with John Pierce and walked in while I was giving the presentation and were quite impressed with Adam's presentation.

30:21.992 --> 30:31.545
And then I began to get more and more stuff out of Washington coming to me and of course that made John Calhoun's job easier.

30:32.926 --> 30:35.149
You do know that Calhoun's the one that thought up the Sea Grant.

30:35.730 --> 30:36.671
Yeah, yeah.

30:36.691 --> 30:38.594
He was in the Kennedy administration.

30:38.614 --> 30:40.597
I know that, yeah.

30:40.617 --> 30:52.234
When Williams had the heart attack and they recreated the system and made him the chancellor of the system and appointed Jarvis and then Calhoun resigned,

30:52.940 --> 30:58.308
Did the change at the academic vice president and the president level, did that make any difference?

30:58.328 --> 31:13.753
No, it didn't filter down to us, but, you know, it was clear that there was a lot of machinations going on there, you know, when you begin taking sides between Jarvis and John Calhoun and Jarvis.

31:15.035 --> 31:18.340
And then Jarvis and Frank Huber.
