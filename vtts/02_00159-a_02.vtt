WEBVTT

00:02.157 --> 00:10.753
DA employee, an agronomist, senior agronomist, but he also was a full professor in the A&M system.

00:10.773 --> 00:18.227
So he held a post in the university.

00:19.529 --> 00:25.600
And we had people like those at Greenville, folks in Big Spring, folks in Lubbock.

00:27.571 --> 00:31.056
people in El Paso who were federal employees.

00:31.157 --> 00:37.006
We worked with them without ever recognizing who paid their salary.

00:37.546 --> 00:45.679
Now, your salary was during those 50s and 60s was paid entirely by the university or was it partly federal?

00:45.919 --> 00:48.143
No, altogether experiment station.

00:49.986 --> 00:53.511
Later years, we were required to do some teaching.

00:54.436 --> 00:55.798
certainly expected to.

00:56.539 --> 01:03.168
And I picked up some graduate teaching somewhere along around 1970.

01:03.488 --> 01:08.795
I taught a course in, graduate course in plant breeding for a while.

01:10.237 --> 01:21.692
Later I joined with a couple of colleagues and we team taught a course, a man out of plant pathology, man out of entomology and me.

01:22.111 --> 01:27.860
And we would partition this course, and we'd each teach it about six or eight weeks.

01:28.561 --> 01:30.384
A very successful course.

01:31.045 --> 01:33.609
And do you remember the name of it?

01:33.830 --> 01:35.092
Host Plant Resistance.

01:36.434 --> 01:39.138
Host Plant Resistance.

01:39.158 --> 01:41.402
In those days, that was a buzzword.

01:41.990 --> 01:57.566
particularly in cotton and a few other crops, that really was the advent of integrated pest management, which was a very popular concept because it had some very strong apostles.

01:58.887 --> 02:00.028
It also had lots of money.

02:01.530 --> 02:07.756
So we got into that very heavily here and in other places.

02:08.577 --> 02:11.760
That's where I really began to work with the entomologists.

02:12.668 --> 02:23.164
Perry Atkinson in particular, beginning about 1957 or 58 when Perry came here from Arkansas.

02:24.165 --> 02:27.090
Describe young Perry Atkinson when you first met him.

02:29.273 --> 02:38.507
Young Perry Atkinson, when I first met him, was trying to get his feet wet.

02:40.040 --> 02:54.294
He had certain interests and a very knowledgeable, he was knowledgeable, had a good expertise in insect management, cotton insects.

02:54.314 --> 02:56.256
Was he kind of shy, kind of reserved?

02:56.276 --> 02:56.716
Yeah, yes.

02:57.337 --> 03:00.440
Perry was not a very outgoing person.

03:00.460 --> 03:01.461
Let me put it that way.

03:01.761 --> 03:04.624
Perry still is not a very outgoing person.

03:05.145 --> 03:09.709
I talked with him this morning about 6 o'clock at the gym.

03:11.107 --> 03:16.085
Perry's like Perry has always been, even when we traveled together quite a bit.

03:18.213 --> 03:21.184
He was not the life of the party.

03:22.092 --> 03:23.033
That was his nature.

03:23.774 --> 03:26.356
I don't mean he was a recluse or anything like that.

03:26.376 --> 03:34.704
Perry's rather reserved, and he probably was smart enough to observe a lot of things when the rest of us were flapping our mouth.

03:36.326 --> 03:41.811
Now, his, was there any particular parasites he was working on?

03:42.072 --> 03:42.292
Yes.

03:44.194 --> 03:49.559
Perry really developed his reputation working on the cotton bulwyrm.

03:49.799 --> 03:50.580
That's what I thought.

03:51.944 --> 04:10.000
And that's where I first got acquainted with him because he came over and I helped him, as I remember, picking out some germplasm, some cotton stalks, exotic things that he could use in his research studies.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.182
That's where I got acquainted with Perry.

04:14.204 --> 04:20.550
Later on, I was fortunate to get tied up not only with Perry but with Knox Walker.

04:21.593 --> 04:33.225
Knox was maybe the premier cotton bow research, cotton bow weevil research man, certainly in Texas, maybe in the U.S.

04:34.707 --> 04:46.740
And I worked with Knox very closely for probably 12, 15 years in developing management programs for both the bow worm, flea hopper, and the bow weevil.

04:48.880 --> 04:57.894
All of that was an integrated program involved engineers and agronomists, entomologists, whatnot.

04:58.816 --> 05:06.047
Another person I was fortunate to work with a good bit was Lambert Wilkes in ag engineering.

05:06.167 --> 05:12.357
We did some fairly pioneering study in mechanical harvesting of cotton.

05:14.345 --> 05:16.327
Now, Wayne Hall.

05:17.309 --> 05:26.260
Wayne Hall I first knew as a prof. I took a course in plant growth regulators from Wayne Hall.

05:26.860 --> 05:27.802
Oh, describe that.

05:29.964 --> 05:32.347
Describe him as a graduate instructor.

05:33.028 --> 05:33.889
He was a toughie.

05:35.311 --> 05:38.034
Wayne was a toughie.

05:38.054 --> 05:41.078
And he was demanding.

05:41.885 --> 05:42.526
Very fair.

05:43.186 --> 05:44.087
A good instructor.

05:44.528 --> 05:45.109
Well prepared?

05:45.369 --> 05:46.030
Well prepared.

05:46.070 --> 05:47.371
Oh, yeah.

05:47.391 --> 05:51.916
But that was often a little chemistry, and chemistry was never one of my strengths.

05:53.217 --> 05:55.740
And that's where I first knew Wayne Hall.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.883
Because wasn't he a pioneer in defoliation?

05:59.344 --> 05:59.564
Yes.

06:01.486 --> 06:01.586
Yeah.

06:01.606 --> 06:05.010
And we worked with him some, in a minor way, over the years.

06:06.352 --> 06:09.495
Being in the applied end of the cotton business, we

06:09.796 --> 06:24.095
had some working relationships with physiologists, entomologists, pathologists, engineers, biochemists, people over in what was then the Cottonseed Products Laboratory, Cecil Womble.

06:25.917 --> 06:32.506
It really was a fantastic career because it was not closed.

06:32.706 --> 06:34.268
I had contacts

06:34.687 --> 06:36.829
with many, many other disciplines.

06:37.270 --> 06:38.991
That was the joy in the work that I did.

06:39.031 --> 06:42.915
This is an editorial note about Dr. Wayne C. Hall.

06:43.956 --> 07:01.774
In the interview with him, I learned from him that he had never seen a cotton plant until he moved to Texas except for two or three that he saw growing in the greenhouse laboratory at the University of Kentucky while he was on the faculty there.

07:02.108 --> 07:14.642
But then after he got here, he did some very, very important work on cotton defoliation and new methods of, that made new methods of harvesting cotton possible.

07:15.342 --> 07:30.258
As you were doing your work, did it matter whether someone was funded by the federal government, the state government, the university, the experiment station, or a private corporation?

07:30.579 --> 07:30.799
No.

07:31.842 --> 07:38.689
That was one of the joys of working in those days, that people just worked together as a team.

07:39.790 --> 07:43.073
It didn't make much difference who paid the bill.

07:43.093 --> 07:45.556
And just about everybody was on 12 months in those days.

07:46.136 --> 07:46.376
Yes.

07:47.057 --> 07:49.820
And certainly in research and extension, yeah.

07:50.961 --> 07:59.149
And did you do any of your, those first years of research, did you do any around the state or was most of it at first here?

07:59.737 --> 08:01.839
For the first three, four years was here.

08:03.121 --> 08:13.433
After I took on the variety evaluation work, immediately the travel thing grew.

08:13.833 --> 08:23.965
What was your first research accomplishment that led you to believe that you were on the right track and led the leaders of the department that they had made a good choice?

08:24.005 --> 08:28.410
What?

08:29.588 --> 08:36.436
The first, I didn't think it was terribly important at the time, but I can remember Richmond making quite a deal out of it.

08:37.297 --> 08:53.875
I might say pioneered the use of data processing in the analysis summarizing of variety test data with Brad Lisenby and Bob Smith

08:54.850 --> 09:02.702
who at that time had a data processing center in the basement floor of the system administration building.

09:03.003 --> 09:07.710
What kind of machinery was in use for data processing then?

09:08.131 --> 09:11.416
Oh, they were great big monster looking things, what they had.

09:11.657 --> 09:14.321
Was IBM key punch?

09:14.341 --> 09:22.073
Yeah, everything was card punched in, read onto cards and then run through

09:22.441 --> 09:24.985
all of those mysterious machines.

09:25.886 --> 09:38.766
And I can almost recall clearly the first year that I put out a test bulletin with data, utilizing data that had been through the DPC at that time.

09:39.968 --> 09:40.809
That was a new thing.

09:41.790 --> 09:51.385
The second piece of work that I really enjoyed, mechanical harvesting was really coming into its

09:51.753 --> 09:55.318
into its own in the 50s, late 50s particularly.

09:55.759 --> 09:57.642
Hand harvesting was a thing of the past.

09:59.365 --> 10:16.731
Traditional cotton varieties grown for machine picking, not stripping, machine picking, were what we call open bowl varieties, in which the seed cotton was held in such a way that it could be easily extracted by hand.

10:17.690 --> 10:27.459
With machine harvesting, that crop had to send there for an extended period of time until, let's say it was two-thirds open and mature.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.201
Then you'd come in with a machine.

10:30.642 --> 10:40.551
So the crop needed some protection from the elements simply to reduce weather loss, pre-harvest loss as we considered it.

10:41.352 --> 10:47.578
And I can recall talking to Richmond about we need to develop some types that would

10:48.419 --> 10:55.811
Provide some protection from the elements and still be suitable for machine harvesting.

10:55.831 --> 10:56.673
That was my baby.

10:58.235 --> 11:13.701
And I went out and everything I could put my hands on and made hundreds of plant selections of plants in which the seed cotton was held more tightly in the burr.

11:15.014 --> 11:22.322
That was the beginning of what I called my storm resistance breeding program.

11:22.342 --> 11:26.307
And that's where I got tied up with engineers in machine harvesting.

11:26.327 --> 11:27.128
That was about when?

11:29.751 --> 11:30.171
Early 70s?

11:30.191 --> 11:31.373
19, 1656.

11:31.913 --> 11:44.127
That really came into its own in the 60s and really hit well around 1970, early 70s.

11:44.782 --> 11:46.344
By then it was being picked up.

11:46.704 --> 11:51.711
We were producing what we called breeding, primary breeding stocks.

11:52.892 --> 11:56.597
It was emphasized to me by Dr. Richmond.

11:56.977 --> 12:00.642
My job was not to produce commercial varieties.

12:01.042 --> 12:02.924
If that happened, that was sort of incidental.

12:03.385 --> 12:13.978
But rather to try and develop characteristics, plant characteristics, in stable breeding material that could be given to

12:14.448 --> 12:20.377
Mr. Lankard or anybody else who wanted to use them for development of commercial cultivars.

12:21.579 --> 12:37.485
So we developed a series of storm resistant breeding stocks which were later fed out into numerous commercial breeders for integration into their variety development programs.

12:38.847 --> 12:40.810
That probably was the first real

12:41.752 --> 12:44.035
tangible thing I could put my finger on.

12:44.055 --> 12:58.274
Do you remember any time when a dean or a department head or something really patted you on the back and you thought, okay, I've succeeded when that happened first?

12:58.294 --> 13:00.337
Well, many people didn't pay much attention to us.

13:01.979 --> 13:06.946
It was rare for an administrator to come to the field.

13:08.067 --> 13:09.970
Jarvis Miller was one of the first ones.

13:11.536 --> 13:12.237
Quite frankly.

13:15.880 --> 13:22.246
When you, who was the director of the experiment station in the 60s?

13:22.506 --> 13:22.727
R.D.

13:22.767 --> 13:23.067
Lewis.

13:23.487 --> 13:24.068
Oh, yes, yes.

13:24.528 --> 13:25.569
Describe Dr. Lewis.

13:27.491 --> 13:31.655
He was kind of a contradiction.

13:33.517 --> 13:35.239
He was a rather forceful man.

13:37.501 --> 13:39.923
Somewhat demanding.

13:42.012 --> 13:43.454
I had no problems with him at all.

13:44.656 --> 13:47.640
When I first knew him, I was a bit intimidated by him.

13:49.522 --> 13:52.486
I learned later that he, that was a bit of a facade.

13:54.849 --> 13:59.175
So that was the man I initially worked under as a director was, was R.D.

13:59.215 --> 13:59.495
Lewis.

13:59.515 --> 14:01.999
Because now he was, he grew up out of state.

14:02.059 --> 14:05.944
He was Ohio, if I remember right.

14:06.397 --> 14:09.240
See, I served with him on that aspirations committee.

14:09.721 --> 14:10.241
Yeah.

14:10.482 --> 14:17.610
And he was one of the very positive voices looking to the future of what A&M could become.

14:17.650 --> 14:18.150
He was good.

14:18.411 --> 14:18.831
You bet.

14:18.851 --> 14:19.672
He had a good vision.

14:20.113 --> 14:29.063
And did he, was it normal for him to listen to new ideas?

14:31.422 --> 14:32.123
I'd say yes.

14:33.364 --> 14:38.130
Did he have, as far as you know, did he have any pet peeves or any blind spots?

14:39.252 --> 14:43.437
His pet peeves, I thought, always thought, were people who didn't.

14:46.721 --> 14:48.343
How do I phrase this?

14:48.363 --> 14:58.476
He sort of had an idea of how you were to behave as a professional and what your responsibilities were to the organization.

14:58.945 --> 15:08.378
I remember how he expected everybody to come to the Experiment Station staff meetings, and he didn't take it kindly.

15:08.398 --> 15:15.669
If you didn't show up, I know from personal experience.

15:16.570 --> 15:22.519
And how was a professional to be dressed at one of those meetings?

15:23.159 --> 15:26.404
Well, I don't know that he ever mandated, but you just knew.

15:27.430 --> 15:29.292
that you didn't come in there in your grody's.

15:31.175 --> 15:40.447
He himself projected an image of propriety, and it sort of slopped back onto us.

15:40.707 --> 15:46.695
It put us on our good behavior, I thought, both in our looks and our behavior.

15:48.778 --> 15:56.728
Did he or any other key person have any, instead of pet peeves, any pet preferences?

15:57.535 --> 16:05.543
things that you're deeply interested in, where if you were going to do this kind of research, you knew it would be easier to get support.

16:06.364 --> 16:08.987
I can't think of anything like that.

16:10.088 --> 16:20.559
One of the, and I think Lewis had a lot to do with this, the development of such a comprehensive cotton research program at Texas A&M University.

16:21.500 --> 16:25.264
He supported it very strongly with people like Richmond,

16:26.290 --> 16:36.021
Maida Brown, Margaret Menzel, Charlie Lewis, and all of the others in the system.

16:36.041 --> 16:39.525
And Dr. Lewis supported that, encouraged that.

16:40.046 --> 16:47.334
What other important crop products were there important research done on?

16:48.575 --> 16:48.956
Corn?

16:49.236 --> 16:50.998
Corn, grain sorghum, certainly.

16:52.109 --> 17:00.900
especially through the work of Carper and Quimby in Chillicothe and later on up in Lubbock, some of those folks.

17:01.720 --> 17:06.867
Let's say cotton, grain sorghum, corn.

17:09.249 --> 17:09.710
Maize.

17:10.271 --> 17:12.213
Yeah, maize.

17:12.313 --> 17:14.356
And what my grandparents call high gear.

17:14.856 --> 17:16.778
High gear, yeah, grain sorghum.

17:17.980 --> 17:20.142
Yeah, that's what they call it here is high gear.

17:20.163 --> 17:20.263
Yeah.

17:20.283 --> 17:21.424
Everybody calls it high gear.

17:21.961 --> 17:32.897
There was a good bit of pioneering work done, I think, in those days in crops like soybeans, castor beans, sunflowers, some of the minor crops.

17:35.521 --> 17:40.848
Murray Kinman was a USDA employee who had the castor bean program, for instance.

17:42.110 --> 17:48.399
In hindsight, were there any omissions?

17:48.419 --> 17:49.521
As I look at it now,

17:51.037 --> 17:57.924
No, because we had, I thought, a full complement of professional programs.

17:58.484 --> 17:59.886
Big programs, small grains.

17:59.906 --> 18:07.774
I. M. Atkins, who was really almost a giant in that, you know.

18:07.834 --> 18:09.275
Johnny Rogers in corn.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.381
Is that the John Rogers I see at church every Sunday?

18:15.561 --> 18:16.302
Yes.

18:16.552 --> 18:18.895
I did, had a good interview with him.

18:18.915 --> 18:19.015
Yeah.

18:19.035 --> 18:20.477
Great individual.

18:20.497 --> 18:21.238
Good scientist.

18:21.338 --> 18:21.679
Fine man.

18:21.699 --> 18:23.782
Good administrator.

18:23.802 --> 18:23.962
Yeah.

18:24.723 --> 18:27.447
Now, when you completed your dissertation, that was what year?

18:27.467 --> 18:28.328
59.

18:28.348 --> 18:28.628
59.

18:30.070 --> 18:33.715
Did that make any obvious change in your status or?

18:35.838 --> 18:39.403
I think I was made an associate professor shortly after that.

18:39.903 --> 18:43.268
And your research stayed at the same pace.

18:43.923 --> 18:49.248
It grew gradually and shifted a little through time.

18:50.649 --> 19:10.268
We began somewhat by default to de-emphasize the basic research in cytology, cytogenetics and genetics, partly because of funding, partly because of competition for money and

19:12.610 --> 19:15.754
All of these programs go through phases, it seems.

19:15.814 --> 19:19.379
You get an emphasis on genetics.

19:20.781 --> 19:25.007
Then that begins to fade after a while, and they want to do applied research.

19:25.087 --> 19:28.071
And then they decide applied research is not good enough.

19:28.592 --> 19:29.914
We go into something else.

19:31.216 --> 19:36.884
Probably the biggest thing I ever got into was disintegrated pest management.

19:38.205 --> 19:39.327
Disintegrated?

19:39.965 --> 19:41.667
Integrated pest management.

19:41.687 --> 19:42.168
Oh, integrated.

19:42.188 --> 19:42.569
Yeah.

19:42.589 --> 19:43.230
Integrated.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.872
Because that became a buzzword.

19:47.135 --> 19:57.069
Because of the chemical, the pollutant thing, the cost, the inherent dangers and all of that, chemical use and so forth.

19:57.089 --> 20:02.597
So there were some disciples in this country that really pushed that, and they were very effective at it.

20:02.617 --> 20:05.781
Barry Atkinson was one of them, a major player in that.

20:07.023 --> 20:08.605
And we had a consortium.

20:09.023 --> 20:11.048
When did that- Mind you.

20:11.629 --> 20:14.656
In your- That goes back into the seventies.

20:14.676 --> 20:15.217
Yeah.

20:15.237 --> 20:18.845
Did anyone tell you to make that shift or did you- No.

20:20.409 --> 20:21.351
It just sort of grew.

20:22.874 --> 20:28.146
From my contacts that I already had with people like Knox Walker and Perry

20:28.717 --> 20:31.300
and Luther Byrd and others.

20:32.041 --> 20:34.003
It just seemed the natural thing to do.

20:34.364 --> 20:36.005
Were all of them in agronomy?

20:36.546 --> 20:37.327
No.

20:37.347 --> 20:39.970
Byrd was over in pathology.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.432
Walker was in entomology.

20:43.214 --> 20:45.136
Lambert Wilkes over in ag engineering.

20:46.418 --> 20:48.320
Some of the same individuals.

20:48.360 --> 20:52.565
We just changed our focus a little bit and what we emphasized.

20:53.606 --> 20:56.209
In all the years that you've worked here,

20:57.134 --> 21:05.973
Was it comparatively easy, was it normal that there be people from a number of departments working together?

21:07.817 --> 21:13.810
Was there any department that was less cooperative or least cooperative?

21:15.730 --> 21:16.030
No.

21:16.831 --> 21:18.614
No, I would not say that there was.

21:18.634 --> 21:19.835
Oh, good, good.

21:19.855 --> 21:23.720
I can't recall ever having someone turn me down.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.663
Now, your funding was from?

21:28.265 --> 21:39.199
Funding was, well, initially we had a good bit of hatch money, or what they call regional research money, experiment station money.

21:41.281 --> 21:44.185
We had good funds early in the 50s.

21:45.295 --> 21:48.941
Those became a little tougher to get up into the 60s.

21:50.183 --> 21:56.212
Particularly the federal funds became much more restrictive.

21:58.636 --> 22:01.501
Then we started playing the grant, the contract grant thing.

22:03.103 --> 22:06.268
And that's where a lot of our later money came from.

22:06.288 --> 22:07.390
Explain, describe that.

22:07.590 --> 22:09.513
Well, things like Cotton Incorporated.

22:11.256 --> 22:13.159
That's when the cotton industry decided they had

22:13.696 --> 22:16.159
to start building their own program of funding.

22:16.220 --> 22:21.006
So, we got good funding out of Cotton Incorporated.

22:22.348 --> 22:29.939
Then there was an organization called the Natural Fibers Commission of Texas.

22:31.661 --> 22:39.232
It was organized over as a market, or as an economics project at the University of Texas.

22:39.632 --> 22:42.336
But later, there was a

22:42.620 --> 22:49.669
a central organization for that that was managed by a fellow named Carl Cox, was the one that I knew the best.

22:50.550 --> 22:51.591
And they had monies.

22:52.953 --> 22:55.135
And we lived off some of that.

22:55.396 --> 22:58.079
Some of that money is still in the program here now.

22:59.280 --> 23:05.608
So in the later years, we had a major portion of our money came from grants and contracts.

23:06.649 --> 23:09.453
And so you had to work on those sometimes every year?

23:10.114 --> 23:10.534
Yeah.

23:11.206 --> 23:15.594
Sometimes you'd get a grant maybe for three years, which was great.

23:16.475 --> 23:20.082
The ones that were given to you on a yearly basis were really a pain.

23:20.122 --> 23:22.907
You spent too much time doing paperwork, see.

23:24.009 --> 23:26.894
And, of course, there was a bleed off.

23:26.914 --> 23:33.045
If you got $50,000, somebody upstairs took off about 30 or 40 percent of that, see.

23:33.447 --> 23:45.425
give some sample experiences of trying to renew those grants, where you went to somewhere and tried to make a presentation, and positive, negative, or goofy.

23:46.266 --> 24:00.788
Probably the one that was the toughest to handle was the Consortium for Integrated Pest Management, because that involved numerous disciplines.

24:00.953 --> 24:03.537
It involved, I think, five universities.

24:05.379 --> 24:07.242
So there was a lot of competition for that money.

24:08.503 --> 24:10.686
And we used to have to prepare reports.

24:10.826 --> 24:12.369
And we would have seminars.

24:13.250 --> 24:16.955
And you had to sell your program and its potential.

24:18.076 --> 24:20.540
And they could be pretty cutthroat when they had to be.

24:21.501 --> 24:26.508
A person like Perry Atkinson could see through weaknesses in programs quite easily.

24:27.249 --> 24:28.851
And he was a major player in that.

24:30.738 --> 24:32.120
That was the toughest one to do.

24:32.801 --> 24:39.290
The Cotton Incorporated was influenced too much by politics, I think.

24:39.690 --> 24:41.352
State politics, national politics?

24:41.372 --> 24:42.173
National politics.

24:42.754 --> 24:45.218
This state, this state, that sort of thing.

24:45.838 --> 24:53.248
So in a sense, you had to compete with co-workers for interest and for support.

24:54.330 --> 24:57.454
But I can't criticize all that because it kept us going very well.

24:58.092 --> 25:12.811
At the local level, who were some of the outstanding allies that y'all had to keep this money flowing?

25:15.455 --> 25:17.437
You mean organizations or people?

25:17.497 --> 25:17.758
People.

25:20.982 --> 25:22.564
Perry Atkinson, obviously, is one of them.

25:24.063 --> 25:28.307
Carl Cox with natural fibers, food protein.

25:30.189 --> 25:36.016
And, of course, the Experiment Station Director was very influential in that, whoever that might be.

25:36.416 --> 25:37.177
Jarvis was good.

25:37.277 --> 25:37.657
All right.

25:37.677 --> 25:38.799
Now, Jarvis followed?

25:40.400 --> 25:40.681
Lewis.

25:40.981 --> 25:41.702
He followed R.D.

25:41.722 --> 25:42.002
Lewis.

25:42.242 --> 25:42.823
Yes.

25:42.843 --> 25:42.943
Okay.

25:42.963 --> 25:44.565
And you described Dr. Lewis a bit.

25:44.625 --> 25:49.910
Describe Jarvis as the Experiment Station Director.

25:49.930 --> 25:51.572
I'm biased because I really

25:52.480 --> 25:56.004
had a good rapport, personal rapport with Jarvis.

25:56.104 --> 25:56.545
That's fine.

25:57.966 --> 26:02.952
I can recall him telling me one time, Albie, if you ever want to talk to me, come on down here.

26:03.873 --> 26:07.457
If I'm around, come in, sit down, we'll talk about whatever you want to talk about.

26:07.477 --> 26:09.039
Where was his office?

26:09.079 --> 26:11.422
Down in the system building.

26:13.924 --> 26:15.366
One of the...

26:16.747 --> 26:24.958
One thing that interested Jarvis, as I recall, he had been overseas in the Dominican for some time.

26:25.579 --> 26:29.965
Jarvis was a strong proponent of international work.

26:31.267 --> 26:38.497
And he encouraged me in that and allowed me to do a fair amount of that while he was in office.

26:39.398 --> 26:40.159
And so did others.

26:41.361 --> 26:43.564
And that was one of the nicest part of my

26:44.236 --> 26:53.284
job, my career, the last 20 years, 15 to 20 years, I did a good bit of international travel and working with people internationally.

26:53.905 --> 26:54.045
Right.

26:54.065 --> 26:55.886
Now, he became the director in the early 70s?

26:55.986 --> 26:57.268
He became the director.

26:57.328 --> 27:04.814
That would have to be in, yeah, I'd say somewhere, yeah.

27:04.834 --> 27:06.836
Yeah, because he was, mm-hmm.

27:06.896 --> 27:10.239
And his family, I know, had big farming acreage.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.602
Did they, had they grown cotton?

27:15.539 --> 27:16.360
I don't recall.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.843
It was down toward Victoria, Orange Grove.

27:18.943 --> 27:21.026
Down toward Victoria, somewhere down in there.

27:21.046 --> 27:23.789
Yeah, and I don't know whether they grew cotton or not, but I'd be surprised.

27:23.829 --> 27:24.731
Probably.

27:24.751 --> 27:25.451
I bet they did.

27:25.512 --> 27:27.174
Because there was good cotton country down in there.

27:27.454 --> 27:30.037
So he seemed to understand thoroughly.

27:30.057 --> 27:36.145
Jarvis had a working man's feel, I thought, for agriculture.

27:37.427 --> 27:40.230
And I contrast that with a little more.

27:40.666 --> 27:43.731
esoteric look at the thing that some folks might bring in.

27:44.932 --> 27:45.774
Folks like Clark.

27:47.436 --> 27:48.518
Good administrators.

27:48.538 --> 27:49.559
Neville Clark.

27:50.020 --> 27:52.003
Good administrators, but tough.

27:52.464 --> 27:53.385
Did he follow Jarvis?

27:56.570 --> 27:58.252
I think so.

27:59.033 --> 27:59.514
I think so.

27:59.694 --> 28:00.576
I think that's right.

28:01.196 --> 28:01.337
Yeah.

28:01.677 --> 28:02.699
So I remember when he came.

28:03.340 --> 28:05.543
I'd see Jarvis move on up.

28:07.306 --> 28:08.968
See, we had an international programs

28:10.585 --> 28:14.810
international office here for a long time.

28:17.254 --> 28:19.336
And they helped a great deal.

28:20.758 --> 28:26.305
See, Bloodworth ultimately went over there, out of our department.

28:26.325 --> 28:28.648
And of course, he helped a lot when he was in there.

28:29.249 --> 28:29.970
He didn't hurt me.

28:30.571 --> 28:32.073
I could travel easily.

28:34.055 --> 28:39.242
But we worked a lot with folks in Mexico, Argentina, Israel.

28:41.095 --> 28:42.377
All on cotton?

28:42.397 --> 28:43.798
Yeah, we had contact with them.

28:44.199 --> 28:49.505
We used to exchange data, exchange seed stocks, and they'd come to visit all the time.

28:49.686 --> 28:50.827
The Israelis grew cotton?

28:51.348 --> 28:51.788
Oh, yeah.

28:52.669 --> 28:53.430
I didn't know that.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.653
I was amazed when I went over there.

28:56.054 --> 28:56.534
I didn't know that.

28:56.554 --> 28:58.497
Some of the finest cotton I ever saw in my life.

28:58.637 --> 28:59.938
I didn't know they had the spice.

28:59.958 --> 29:00.018
Oh.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.722
Their agriculture blew me.

29:03.623 --> 29:03.723
Yeah.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.365
Did any of the Arab nations?

29:05.885 --> 29:07.186
to grow cotton?

29:07.206 --> 29:13.552
Egypt, Pakistan, India, Iraq, Iran.

29:14.934 --> 29:19.358
All of those had cotton to some fairly important crops.

29:19.378 --> 29:24.003
South Africa, that's where I really got my foot into the African thing.

29:24.883 --> 29:30.209
And we had people who came here because of our reputation as a cotton center here.

29:30.969 --> 29:31.690
We drew

29:32.227 --> 29:36.381
a lot of international students and a lot of international visitors.

29:37.863 --> 29:44.891
And our people, Richmond and Maida Brown, for instance, had international.

29:44.911 --> 29:51.459
They spent quite a bit of time in Europe and Africa invited as visiting scientists.

29:52.220 --> 29:56.485
So we had a reputation at that time in the 50s and early 60s.

29:58.087 --> 30:05.355
As your work broadened your research,

30:06.635 --> 30:15.563
You as a professional remain primarily a research professional, not a teaching professional.

30:15.583 --> 30:17.304
That's right.

30:17.324 --> 30:28.434
What were the basic satisfactions, the fun, the joy, the reasons to celebrate for a researcher?

30:28.454 --> 30:33.158
If I look back on it in retrospect, I would make one claim.

30:34.940 --> 30:36.321
I, along with some of my

30:36.638 --> 30:49.977
colleagues in those years experienced the golden years of agricultural search at Texas A&M University.

30:52.281 --> 31:05.700
Now the things that really gave me a great deal of pleasure were graduate students, working with them and seeing them develop an expertise which later

31:06.575 --> 31:10.522
came to fruition in their own programs.

31:10.562 --> 31:15.149
They became major players in their companies and in their countries.

31:15.951 --> 31:16.792
I have several of those.

31:17.253 --> 31:19.416
Describe as many of those as you want to.

31:19.436 --> 31:23.503
Oh, I have a couple of them in Mexico who were very good friends.

31:25.186 --> 31:28.952
We had a couple came here one time, knocked on the door one night.

31:30.274 --> 31:33.139
We opened the door and there was a man, his wife,
