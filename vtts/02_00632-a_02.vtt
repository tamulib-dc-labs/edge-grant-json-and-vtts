00:15.640 --> 00:22.792
First of all, now, about breakwater, what do you 
mean it's an altogether different principle or

00:15.640 --> 00:22.792
principle conceived of differently than it has 
been in the past? Well, in the past, the whole

00:22.812 --> 00:34.392
matter of defending, let's say, a coast or a harbor 
against waves had been to pile in a lot of rock. This

00:35.958 --> 00:39.242
does some absorption, some reflection. It 
interferes with sand flow. It can be disastrous.

00:43.648 --> 00:44.889
It's irreversible. There's no way to really tear 
it down once it's built. We see these kinds of

00:47.853 --> 00:54.862
disasters all around the world where it's set up 
waves of beach erosion. There's a static approach

00:54.882 --> 01:03.973
of sitting up there obstructing the waves by 
putting in a massive chunks of rocks, sometimes

01:05.405 --> 01:10.212
wired together and cemented together. This is a 
much more subtle way of destroying waves, which is

01:11.414 --> 01:18.544
to set something that causes the waves to destroy 
themselves. It's driven by the pressure field and

01:19.886 --> 01:23.751
acts against the orbits of the wave. And what you 
want is the least dense material rather than the

01:24.793 --> 01:31.783
most dense material. You want it to have the 
greatest freedom of motion rather than the least

01:32.793 --> 01:37.440
freedom of motion. And it truly degrades the waves 
into eddies, rather than reflecting it to a great

01:38.301 --> 01:47.554
extent, you see. This is why the approaches to some 
coasts, to breakwaters, are rather dangerous,

01:48.135 --> 01:54.084
because you have these highly reflected waves. So 
it's a totally different principle. But I don't

01:57.389 --> 02:00.353
really limit it to that. The whole business of 
intervening into the phase of the wave rather than

02:01.008 --> 02:09.062
the orbits of the wave is quite a different 
approach. You have linked yourself into

02:10.285 --> 02:15.614
something that is, in principle, much more 
energetic. That isn't quite the right way to say

02:17.578 --> 02:22.847
it, but rather that The velocities involved are 
much higher than they are. The rate at which the

02:26.271 --> 02:32.020
wave form is going across the ocean is much higher 
than the rate at which the water is moving. Even

02:32.641 --> 02:35.165
Leonardo da Vinci understood that quite well. I 
mean, what I mean even. Leonardo da Vinci

02:37.689 --> 02:40.653
understood that one quite well. But see, if you can 
link things into this rapid motion of the velocity

02:47.093 --> 02:49.757
of the wave form across the ocean. It's orders of 
magnitude greater than the actual water motion.

02:53.964 --> 02:59.873
Most things, like a rubble mount breakwater, 
intervene with a orbital motion, a smaller

02:53.964 --> 02:59.873
motion. This intervenes into the wave form 
itself. If you can link that in so you get energy out

03:04.520 --> 03:09.928
also, then you've done a much more effective job. 
You ordinarily only see this kind of linkage in the

03:12.102 --> 03:17.108
case of surfboarding, for example. And then it's 
much degraded because it's been much slowed down.

03:20.652 --> 03:24.016
But the velocities that are involved, you can 
already see are very high. But if you can do this in

03:26.399 --> 03:30.805
the open sea, you see you're talking about 
velocities of 40 and 50 miles an hour. You've

03:32.627 --> 03:36.912
linked to the pressure gradient.

03:37.111 --> 03:40.795
I know one can't say when an idea first came to him 
along this way. I realize that. But roughly when

03:42.796 --> 03:46.560
did you begin to work on the problem in terms of... 
Which one? The problem of... The breakwater? The

03:49.082 --> 03:49.963
breakwater problem.

03:54.508 --> 04:05.278
Well, I'd always had this in mind, more or less, in a 
kind of a vague, unformed, diaphanous way, since

03:54.508 --> 04:05.278
I'd worked on the torpedo net problem. And every 
time I saw buoys that

04:05.917 --> 04:20.634
were partly hauled down, I was always impressed by 
their tremendously erratic motion. And then how

04:21.475 --> 04:27.402
am I talking about it in class? And I said, why don't 
we just really see, why don't somebody take the

04:28.141 --> 04:39.735
project to really seeing how one of these spheres 
behaves and how much energy it really, from the

04:28.141 --> 04:39.735
wave, it really does dissipate. And one of the kids 
in the class took it up and looked at it and decided,

04:41.818 --> 04:53.052
yes, it was out of phase and did dissipate 30 or 40 
times the energy that it would if it were held

04:41.818 --> 04:53.052
rigidly. And then he dropped it, and then another 
kid took it up and really designed it through. And

04:57.497 --> 05:08.009
he now has his PhD and is working for the state, 
building these things for the state of

04:57.497 --> 05:08.009
California, investigating that whole 
potential.

05:12.253 --> 05:14.916
So how do you exactly say when such a thing comes up? 
You see, I began to understand some years ago when

05:15.717 --> 05:22.465
we were working with

05:23.002 --> 05:32.433
deep-sea moorings, where we made some deep-sea 
moorings that survived out in the Pacific three or

05:23.002 --> 05:32.433
four years in more than 3,000 fathoms of water. But 
one of the reasons these survived was that they did

05:33.094 --> 05:38.460
behave something in this fashion. And this 
allowed them, in a storm, to dodge the high waves.

05:43.446 --> 05:46.309
They moved around the high waves rather than over 
them. See, in a storm, the sea is a kind of

05:47.943 --> 05:59.220
stochastic topography of rapidly moving crests, 
of short crests. And if you now put a buoy out there

05:59.240 --> 06:09.996
that is hauled down strongly and doesn't weigh 
much, it threads its way between these crests in a

05:59.240 --> 06:09.996
complicated pattern. So it never gets hit by the 
highways. It dodges them automatically.

06:17.226 --> 06:17.747
And...

06:21.338 --> 06:33.351
And it's clear this energy is coming from the 
waves, and that it's considerably more than just

06:21.338 --> 06:33.351
if the buoy were floating there and the waves were 
dragging against it. So all of this sort of fits

06:33.371 --> 06:38.837
together, and you finally decide, well, maybe 
this is a real way to go. So

06:40.259 --> 06:44.183
allow me to try it. So in other words, a whole 
combination of ideas, you would argue, in terms of

06:44.203 --> 06:50.670
science, experimenting with both small things 
and large things, drifts you into handling big

06:51.072 --> 06:55.358
problems. And that's poorly put. Let me try it this 
way. It's that you begin with dealing with

06:59.183 --> 07:09.537
specifics, and then all of a sudden I look up and 
you're... And you observe something that's

06:59.183 --> 07:09.537
irrelevant, perhaps, to the specifics you're 
looking at. And you store that away. And it's an

07:12.056 --> 07:13.798
experience. OK, now, like the iceberg, for 
example. The other day, for instance, I was down on

07:16.982 --> 07:23.711
the beaches in Southern California, in Baja, 
California. And there's loads of sand dollars.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.839
And the sand is eroding by wind. They're on the 
beach, in the dry beach. And the sand is being

07:32.102 --> 07:35.827
driven very rapidly. And these sand dollars, all 
of them, slowly tilt up on little pinnacles of sand

07:39.638 --> 07:46.990
and take an attitude very much like the living 
organism does in the ocean. Well, now that's

07:48.974 --> 07:49.935
strange. You look at 100 or 200 of these things all 
standing up at the same angle, little pinnacle of

07:50.056 --> 07:57.869
sand behind them, holding them in that position. 
And this is much the position, although they're

07:58.390 --> 08:03.698
not without the pinnacle of sand, that you see them 
in the actual ocean. And you begin to wonder how

08:03.718 --> 08:05.241
much of this is mediated through just the 
hydrodynamic shape of the sand dollar, you see,

08:06.048 --> 08:21.272
all facing into the wind, all with their top sides 
towards the wind, all at about almost 60 degrees

08:06.048 --> 08:21.272
inclination, all of them sitting there in like an 
array of these. And sooner or later, maybe, I get a

08:22.366 --> 08:36.621
chance to maybe do some experiments on various 
sorts of creatures that live in a high, strong wave

08:22.366 --> 08:36.621
current regime, like sand dollars, bismuth 
clams, and whatnot. Is their shape a particular

08:37.162 --> 08:44.109
hydrodynamic shape that gives it desirable 
properties, allows it to bury itself, orient

08:37.162 --> 08:44.109
itself, or something? Or is this organically 
mediated through musculature, you see?

08:48.554 --> 08:50.196
Interesting, isn't it, too? So I think all kinds of 
little observations fit together sometimes. And

08:55.291 --> 09:02.238
this is the case of the breakwater point, where 
loads of small observations lead you in some

08:55.291 --> 09:02.238
direction or another. Well, I was also thinking 
about the concept of bringing down icebergs to

09:04.400 --> 09:10.486
furnish fresh water. How did that occur to me? 
Well, I want to know both how it occurred to you, and

09:15.891 --> 09:18.713
then I want your reaction. I remember how it 
occurred to me exactly. I was preparing, there was

09:22.559 --> 09:37.216
quite a bit of interest many years ago, and it keeps 
coming back periodically, of an underwater

09:22.559 --> 09:37.216
pipeline for Southern California to get its water 
from, God knows, Oregon, Washington, British

09:22.559 --> 09:37.216
Columbia, Alaska. What a stupid idea in my way of 
thinking. I mean, you don't know what's going on

09:40.500 --> 09:42.623
down there well enough. There are landslides, 
there are instabilities. There are all kinds of

09:45.826 --> 09:48.870
things, ships dropping their anchors and on and 
on. But nevertheless, you can make the following

09:50.977 --> 09:54.341
calculation. Let's say California needs 5 
million acre feet of water a year. OK, you can start

09:57.444 --> 10:01.369
to optimize this. You can make a pipeline. Now, the 
power to drive that water down that pipeline

10:03.892 --> 10:07.756
doesn't come free. Even though you build a dam up 
there somewhere, you could have made electricity

10:08.217 --> 10:14.043
out of it, you see, rather than driving water. So 
you think, well, I will optimize it. very rapidly

10:19.225 --> 10:29.857
realized that, presently, optimization, just 
from the standpoint of loss, of frictional loss,

10:19.225 --> 10:29.857
comes with bigger and bigger pipelines. And 
presently, you have a pipeline that has all the 5

10:29.937 --> 10:35.182
million acre feet in it. Well, now you might as well 
shirk it up more and just roll it into the ocean and

10:36.704 --> 10:43.652
tow it down. Now you begin to optimize that. It's a 
different concept. Well, I was preparing very

10:50.427 --> 10:57.538
early in my days in the scripts, was preparing a 
talk about the water problem. And one of the things

10:57.818 --> 11:00.062
I wanted to look at was the pipeline. And when I 
optimized this thing, I came out with something

11:01.704 --> 11:10.498
that was half a mile in diameter and five miles long 
or some such a thing. And it was optimum towing

11:11.339 --> 11:12.882
size. And I thought, Jesus, such things exist. 
They're the secondary tabular icebergs of the

11:15.125 --> 11:18.190
South Atlantic. Let's see how these go. What would 
be the milling rate? What would be the thing? And I

11:23.374 --> 11:30.423
made some calculations, and of course you come up 
with this interesting case that's a tome north

11:23.374 --> 11:30.423
from Antarctica. You really tome to the east like 
mad

11:30.443 --> 11:39.094
because of their rotation and Coriolis force, if 
you wish. And so these more recent studies by the

11:41.217 --> 11:45.662
Rand Corporation and so on on it... rather 
thorough studies, go into the Coriolis force

11:46.452 --> 11:57.743
effect

11:46.452 --> 11:57.743
in a rather erudite fashion. But of course, the 
simplest concept in the world gives you exactly

11:58.704 --> 12:02.567
the same answer. It just says you've got to get that 
iceberg going 1,000 miles an hour to get it, not in

12:02.907 --> 12:13.017
respect to the water, but in respect to the fixed 
reference plane, to get it over the equator. you

12:13.739 --> 12:37.198
got to tow it to the east to do this you got to get it 
going a thousand miles an hour to the east to

12:13.739 --> 12:37.198
uh to well to the west sorry you got to get it going a 
thousand miles an hour to the west to get over the

12:13.739 --> 12:37.198
equator and

12:13.739 --> 12:37.198
you got to tow essentially westwardly That's 
correct, isn't it? Good God, let's see. I always

12:41.648 --> 12:43.451
have to go through this thing. You've got to tow it 
to the east. Good heavens, yes. I was rotated there

12:47.637 --> 12:49.179
for a second. You have to tow it to the east. You have 
to get it going 1,000 miles an hour to bring it

12:50.942 --> 12:56.230
essentially to the velocity of the Earth. Now,

12:58.073 --> 13:07.827
when I first remember reading about concepts of 
pulling icebergs to Southern California, Now, I

13:08.397 --> 13:15.464
remember scientists making fun, in fact, of sort 
of jiving this concept, if I may use that word. How

13:16.825 --> 13:26.294
do you feel as if when you introduce these ideas 
that long ago and it seems to be reaffirmed here in

13:16.825 --> 13:26.294
the present in terms of water shortages and 
ecological clashes? Well, I don't think we'll

13:26.594 --> 13:28.436
ever do it in California. You don't think you'll 
ever do it? No. Some other country I'll do it. It's

13:32.940 --> 13:33.861
too outlandish. The United States has lost a sense 
of adventure. I had to examine that and examine

13:37.000 --> 13:40.243
that until hell froze over. Worry about fogs and 
worry about fresh water influences and worry

13:40.984 --> 13:45.889
about this and that. Never tried. What do you 
attribute the loss of adventure to? Oh,

13:52.556 --> 14:03.767
I guess sort of a degree of senescence, I would 
guess.

14:05.570 --> 14:05.931
I don't know. You could erect a thousand theories 
on this, I think. We start out with a great deal of

14:08.455 --> 14:12.241
hybrid vigor in the United States. We have people 
of all sorts of social proclivities mixing

14:12.261 --> 14:16.428
together. And to some degree, they don't mix 
anymore, you see. And I believe in heterosis. That

14:22.218 --> 14:25.764
is the strength of hybridization. And it only goes 
a generation or two, don't forget. Well, that may

14:31.591 --> 14:32.432
be it. Or it may be we're in the same position as a 
person on Easy Street.

14:39.161 --> 14:41.064
Keep your finger on your number, as it were. Don't 
take any chances. There are the real concerns of

14:44.368 --> 14:46.992
the environmentalists, of course. You have to 
look at these things. They're real. You can't kill

14:50.917 --> 14:53.501
off things in vast numbers. But we've gone 
overboard on that, and it's a pendulum-swinging

14:54.162 --> 14:58.628
problem. It may swing back again. But I think that 
we can't do this sort of thing anymore in the United

15:00.633 --> 15:06.600
States. We can't. We can't.

15:16.212 --> 15:22.380
Such a approach takes the agreement of a lot of 
people that you do need the water. You're going to

15:22.500 --> 15:23.542
do it. You're going to take some environmental 
losses. You try to minimize those. And it's too

15:30.080 --> 15:31.543
controversial. The congressman has to take the 
path of least irritation rather than the path of

15:33.005 --> 15:43.423
rationality. Man, as long as I have you here on the 
environment, I had some questions to ask you

15:44.865 --> 15:49.193
later. May I ask them now? Nuclear power. Carry on. 
You've just been through a referendum here in

15:56.043 --> 15:58.265
California. Do you think referendums on nuclear 
power are essentially good things? Referendums

16:02.889 --> 16:04.170
in which way? Well. You mean against or for? 
Against or for. I just, do you think that the public

16:06.773 --> 16:10.776
ought to make these kinds of decisions concerning 
the environment? That's what I'm trying to find

16:10.796 --> 16:12.958
out. Well, of course.

16:17.102 --> 16:24.589
In the United States, we've fallen into the 
advocative position and of our decisions are made

16:25.801 --> 16:28.646
by a series of advocates.

16:32.754 --> 16:34.136
And this is kind of a long story. I don't want to get 
into it too deeply. But there's

16:37.563 --> 16:49.665
obviously a disparity between the scientific 
approach and the approach of advocacy.

16:50.489 --> 16:53.153
takes only that evidence that supports his 
position. That's the way the advocate does. The

16:58.520 --> 17:02.164
scientist is forced into this system to advise. 
And the advocate of the system says you're either

17:04.147 --> 17:10.776
with us or against us in no intermediate way. The 
scientist is unable to express his reservations.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.602
He's got to be gung-ho. got to be in that direction 
or against that direction, one or the other, no

17:16.595 --> 17:21.984
ifs, ands, or buts. And this is essentially an 
anathema to a scientist who really wants to

17:23.086 --> 17:31.139
evaluate things. You can't be all for or all 
against. This way, a budding scientist has such a

17:35.406 --> 17:41.235
hell of a problem with true, false, and questions. 
There aren't any true-false questions. They're

17:43.910 --> 17:45.271
answered true and false. They're always 
reservations one way or another. He either

17:47.214 --> 17:55.643
balances the reservations in which he probably 
fails, or he knows what the hell stupid answer the

17:47.214 --> 17:55.643
instructor really thinks is correct. And that's 
the guy that makes it. But you see, once he gets out

17:59.367 --> 18:10.480
into the real world and is asked for advice, he 
really can't do that and preserve his scientific

17:59.367 --> 18:10.480
equilibrium. And so I think we get into this 
position of

18:11.658 --> 18:27.256
the scientist being essentially in a hopeless 
posture as far as advising the public. The public

18:29.198 --> 18:31.761
can't see the uncertainties. And if he expresses 
the uncertainties, then he's against it,

18:31.861 --> 18:35.265
whatever. Well, in the case of nuclear power,

18:42.809 --> 18:43.750
It's a long argument. There are risks to 
everything, obviously.

18:52.080 --> 19:04.716
I was out in the Pacific and saw the explosion of the 
Great Age bombs, many of them, 28 or something

18:52.080 --> 19:04.716
nuclear shots I've seen. I've seen a vast amount of 
radioactivity thrown into the coral atolls. The

19:11.284 --> 19:12.445
effect of it has been Almost unobservable. The 
ocean has an immense resiliency and capacity.

19:23.473 --> 19:32.966
Exactly what a major spill would be from a nuclear 
power plant or a failure of containment of fuel, I

19:23.473 --> 19:32.966
really haven't looked into. Clearly, you'd have 
some area that would be off limits. But it can't be a

19:41.017 --> 19:42.820
disaster, you see. It can't be a vast disaster.

19:50.276 --> 20:01.750
But of course, you see, then again, we're up 
against the other problem of the utilities always

19:50.276 --> 20:01.750
plan for growth of existing areas. So we have this 
self-fulfilling forecast in which You want the

20:07.117 --> 20:16.973
power plant to supply power for the city of Los 
Angeles because the city of Los Angeles is going to

20:07.117 --> 20:16.973
grow, and then that's the only place it can grow 
because that's the only place there's power, and

20:07.117 --> 20:16.973
so on. You know, the idiotic situation we're in. I 
would like to see power sources put in places where

20:19.998 --> 20:23.003
there aren't anybody. Then they might live there 
instead of, well, if they want to all live in Los

20:23.423 --> 20:28.511
Angeles, that's fine with me. It leaves other 
places a little freer. But our... The number of

20:34.943 --> 20:42.234
forces that tend to concentrate us into these 
areas are insensate forces. There are many of

20:42.294 --> 20:43.696
them. One is the preparation for utilities. 
That's one. The other is, of course, loan and

20:47.241 --> 20:52.188
insurance policy and things of this nature. You 
can't go out in the back country and build a house.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.133
You can't get a loan on it. You don't understand.

21:02.635 --> 21:09.867
We're forced then to put these nuclear power 
plants, if we're going to put them, very close to

21:02.635 --> 21:09.867
highly utilized coastlines.

21:13.112 --> 21:17.780
And intervening into a system that's already has 
very dense use. Under those circumstances, that

21:20.144 --> 21:23.209
may be undesirable. If we put one, if this were a 
free world really, planning the accommodation of

21:25.417 --> 21:35.367
man and this planet together, why wouldn't we put 
one down in Baja, California somewhere?

21:38.430 --> 21:40.833
I both admire that and resent that. I don't want any 
power plants in Baja, California or any place in

21:40.973 --> 21:45.958
the wilderness, I don't think. I know that makes 
sense ecologically, what has to be done.

21:53.058 --> 22:06.817
Well, as long as I have you on resilience of ocean, I 
read in Newsweek magazine last night, this is like

21:53.058 --> 22:06.817
the fourth or fifth time I've read that, where 
Jacques Cousteau, a naturalist, says in 30 years

21:53.058 --> 22:06.817
the ocean would be dead. Do you resent that as a 
scientist?

22:12.345 --> 22:16.071
Let's keep that off the record. I don't want to be 
sued.

22:20.952 --> 22:23.315
until I get my defense fund together. All right. 
I'll rephrase the question another way, then, I

22:25.137 --> 22:30.664
may, without involving any names. I assume you 
believe the ocean is amazingly resilient in terms

22:31.325 --> 22:43.280
of recovery.

22:45.403 --> 22:50.790
Do you think that the ocean should be exploited 
more, move into things like mariculture,

22:52.323 --> 22:53.966
Well, let's stop at the first statement. 
Exploitationist traps has the wrong

22:54.587 --> 22:57.431
connotation. It certainly should be utilized 
more and with good sense, rationality, and

22:58.292 --> 23:05.483
dignity. I think it can be a great deal more. We know 
a great deal more about it than we did 30 years ago.

23:13.175 --> 23:20.727
I've published rather extensively on exactly the 
same business, including Cousteau, if you wish.

23:21.837 --> 23:22.879
And it's right here.

23:27.606 --> 23:28.487
You probably have that. Yeah. And you don't have a 
match, do you? No.

23:42.608 --> 23:47.656
You may, for my answer about Christou, you can read 
that into the record right there. Okay. While I

23:48.717 --> 23:49.819
find a match.

23:58.456 --> 23:59.538
Middle paragraph. Yeah, right. As a matter of 
fact, I had looked at that, and that was one of the

24:00.819 --> 24:07.889
things that interested me last night vis-a-vis 
this. Well,

24:08.150 --> 24:24.653
I assume you believe this sort of adverse 
publicity towards utilization of the ocean

24:08.150 --> 24:24.653
affects only the process of oceanographers?

24:27.216 --> 24:27.737
Affects what? that it has a negative reaction upon 
oceanographers, that this kind of public opinion

24:27.987 --> 24:36.239
that these sorts of things stir up affects your 
work? Well, sure, of course. I

24:37.300 --> 24:53.944
don't really quite know how to answer that 
question, but let me say that I myself and a great

24:37.300 --> 24:53.944
number of other oceanographers have have devoted 
a great deal of their lives trying to solve

24:54.683 --> 25:05.362
problems that society has in some way or another 
enunciated, that it said that they were important

24:54.683 --> 25:05.362
problems.

25:08.749 --> 25:12.515
In several of these cases, we've solved these 
problems and solved them exquisitely. I mean,

25:14.198 --> 25:17.805
much better than one would have expected they 
could have been solved. The understanding of the

25:18.460 --> 25:27.671
pelagic fisheries versus the California 
current, for instance, I think is understood much

25:18.460 --> 25:27.671
better than anybody 20 years ago would have 
expected was ever obtainable. We understand

25:28.412 --> 25:38.264
really something about the total nature of the 
population, how it fluctuates, what the

25:28.412 --> 25:38.264
interrelationships are, and what it's been like 
for 2,000 years. We don't. I think we really

25:39.766 --> 25:41.107
understand that.

25:44.471 --> 25:45.092
And yet... Public opinion is set up at a number of 
thoughtless people who keep saying, don't let the

25:46.760 --> 26:03.118
anchovy go as the sardine did, overfishing, on and 
on, and not allow the proper utilization of this

25:46.760 --> 26:03.118
environment. Now, what you tend to leave behind 
you here is the debris of dedicated scientists who

26:10.672 --> 26:14.437
were trying to serve society. There's not much to 
ask a society to be able to serve it with the best of

26:14.457 --> 26:19.123
your intelligence. Society should be set up in 
such a way that you can.

26:24.491 --> 26:38.890
I think the desalination problem, fisheries 
problems have left behind them in their wake a

26:24.491 --> 26:38.890
great deal of disillusioned people who have tried 
to serve society, advise it, and then find not that

26:24.491 --> 26:38.890
society doesn't act the way they thought it should 
act, but that doesn't even consider the findings

26:39.308 --> 26:46.297
in the decisions. Doesn't even consider them. 
That's the denouement, isn't it? That's the

26:51.363 --> 26:53.065
ultimate coup d'etat. And

26:53.245 --> 26:58.672
so now you find them doing their own thing. Why the 
hell should they try to serve society? I mean,

27:03.157 --> 27:04.299
science is interesting. It's a career. Why not 
just do it? Do the things you want to do. Don't try to

27:08.584 --> 27:09.265
serve it. It doesn't pay attention to you. See, 
it's not a question that you say, well, there's

27:13.343 --> 27:33.045
600,000 tons of anchovies that you ought to be able 
to take out here, maybe a million tons, and enrich

27:13.343 --> 27:33.045
California

27:13.343 --> 27:33.045
to a considerable extent, learn a great deal more 
about the utilization of this part of the food web,

27:13.343 --> 27:33.045
and so forth, that you should do this. The fact that 
society doesn't do that and has

27:38.742 --> 27:46.895
archaic legislation that doesn't allow it to do 
it, and an engraved public opinion that will not

27:38.742 --> 27:46.895
allow it to do it. That's not the question that they 
didn't do it, but that they don't even consider the

27:47.336 --> 28:02.421
findings, that the people who act on these are 
acting only on the basis of the advocates'

28:03.262 --> 28:10.490
of the advocates who argue, the public advocates 
that argue on one side and don't even consider the

28:03.262 --> 28:10.490
evidence. So you find yourself in the position of 
having devoted quite a bit of your life to really

28:11.791 --> 28:30.771
looking into attempting to advise society in 
these practical utilizations of the ocean and

28:11.791 --> 28:30.771
then finding that, not that your findings are not 
acted on, but rather that your findings are not

28:11.791 --> 28:30.771
even considered. in the evidence, in the 
decisions. Quite a disappointment.
