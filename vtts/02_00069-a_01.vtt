WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:15.481
This is August 3rd, and we are at 27 Forest Drive in College Station, and I have the pleasure and honor today of chatting with Dr. Ann Marie Elmquist.

00:15.501 --> 00:18.087
Would you say a sentence now just to test it?

00:18.889 --> 00:19.329
All right.

00:19.510 --> 00:21.434
Well, I'm really looking forward to the interview.

00:22.396 --> 00:23.338
I apologize for it.

00:28.297 --> 00:39.809
Dr. Almquist, to introduce yourself to someone who might listen to this tape or read the transcription, describe your background, where did you grow up, your family, where did you go to high school, and so forth.

00:40.110 --> 00:40.630
Oh, wow.

00:41.872 --> 00:42.392
All right.

00:42.833 --> 00:55.266
I have actually lived most of my life in Texas, starting

00:57.659 --> 01:05.751
with Austin, Texas, coming to College Station by way of Washington, D.C., Boston, Massachusetts, and what else?

01:05.832 --> 01:07.474
I don't know, somewhere in Pennsylvania.

01:08.496 --> 01:19.212
I actually got my elementary and secondary education in Europe, in France,

01:20.508 --> 01:22.850
Czechoslovakia and Switzerland.

01:24.391 --> 01:39.324
And after that as a teenager, young teenager, I came to Texas when my father had taken on a position at the University of Texas in electrical engineering.

01:39.345 --> 01:40.165
He was an academic?

01:40.526 --> 01:41.546
He was an academic.

01:41.647 --> 01:43.408
Where did your parents grow up?

01:43.548 --> 01:50.194
In France and in Czechoslovakia.

01:52.081 --> 01:55.506
So here I was in Austin, ready to go to college.

01:56.787 --> 02:08.262
And I went to the University of Texas, got my bachelor's degree, started on my master's, and the war came, and I got engaged to be married.

02:09.344 --> 02:17.194
And one thing and another, I ended up in Washington, D.C., with no master's degree.

02:17.748 --> 02:32.263
Anyway, I got a job with Army Intelligence, very interesting, four years of it, which was, by the way, a big help.

02:32.547 --> 02:36.073
with all the military guys that I later had in class.

02:36.613 --> 02:43.184
I have a couple of little certificates from the Army, and I displayed them in my office.

02:44.246 --> 02:49.594
And I got a lot of respect after that that I might not have had otherwise.

02:50.165 --> 02:52.989
Now your undergraduate degree was in what specialty?

02:55.512 --> 02:57.715
My undergraduate degree was in French and German.

02:58.537 --> 03:02.582
My master's degree was in French and English.

03:04.144 --> 03:07.689
And I finished that after a number of years.

03:08.070 --> 03:08.711
It took a while.

03:09.171 --> 03:13.777
Four children, another job, the way it goes.

03:14.739 --> 03:19.505
And eventually I ended up with a Ph.D.

03:19.585 --> 03:19.986
at A&M.

03:20.607 --> 03:22.731
In what special?

03:23.032 --> 03:24.736
In Education Administration.

03:25.637 --> 03:28.082
And you got married and those children?

03:28.163 --> 03:30.447
Oh, I got married way back when, during the war.

03:31.510 --> 03:35.578
And then I had four children.

03:37.027 --> 03:44.698
So, actually, my degrees, like that of many women of my generation, was really spaced out.

03:45.278 --> 03:47.061
It wasn't a one, two, three thing.

03:48.503 --> 03:54.151
And I joined the faculty at A&M in 64 or 65.

03:55.092 --> 03:56.314
Now, you all moved here what year?

03:56.794 --> 03:57.996
Oh, we moved here.

03:58.216 --> 03:59.758
My husband was on the faculty.

04:00.299 --> 04:02.022
We came here right after the war.

04:02.863 --> 04:05.987
My husband had been on the faculty before the war.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.542
Oh, I didn't know that.

04:07.703 --> 04:13.716
And got pulled up, you know, and sent to some kind of OCS.

04:14.278 --> 04:15.040
Where did you all meet?

04:16.663 --> 04:17.305
In Texas.

04:17.886 --> 04:19.690
It was a blind date.

04:20.092 --> 04:23.515
We met in Austin, actually.

04:23.635 --> 04:36.887
And so we, in 45, at the end of 45, A&M was trying very, very hard to get its faculty back because of the influx of all the students coming back.

04:37.688 --> 04:42.392
And so we got back to Texas, actually, rather quickly.

04:42.993 --> 04:47.517
By December of 45, we were back at College Station.

04:48.104 --> 04:51.008
And... Now, had you lived in College Station?

04:51.028 --> 04:53.912
No, I'd never lived, I'd never been to College Station before.

04:54.694 --> 04:55.254
Oh, okay.

04:55.274 --> 04:56.036
That's an important.

04:56.496 --> 05:01.263
What was your first, describe the College Station that you first saw.

05:01.403 --> 05:04.087
Well, that was very interesting, because that was in December.

05:05.129 --> 05:07.172
And we had come from Washington, D.C.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.236
I always disliked the East Coast.

05:10.537 --> 05:12.700
It's cold, wet.

05:13.821 --> 05:16.305
And we came here in December.

05:17.230 --> 05:22.038
And it was snowing, cold, and icy.

05:22.058 --> 05:25.223
And I thought to myself, what's going on here?

05:26.806 --> 05:31.073
I thought, while I was in Austin, I didn't have a winter like that.

05:31.994 --> 05:33.797
So anyway, here I was.

05:34.919 --> 05:42.411
And College Station hardly existed.

05:42.678 --> 05:44.521
quite a few private homes.

05:44.581 --> 05:46.003
Houses had already been built.

05:46.323 --> 05:48.487
But no businesses, much of anything.

05:48.907 --> 05:51.712
No restaurants, anything you wanted to go to Bryan for.

05:52.052 --> 05:55.417
Now where did you all live at first?

05:55.437 --> 06:02.968
College Park, corner of Ayrshire and Bell.

06:04.310 --> 06:07.335
It was a very tiny house that my husband

06:08.598 --> 06:10.860
I had built before the war.

06:11.541 --> 06:15.865
It was 18 by 25 feet, the whole house.

06:15.885 --> 06:20.148
But we stayed in it because it was sort of an in and out proposition.

06:21.229 --> 06:34.201
After we'd been back home for two years, my husband or ex-husband or late husband, whatever, went back to Austin himself to get his Ph.D., finish his Ph.D., and finished it.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.385
And I stayed here.

06:39.428 --> 06:44.635
by myself for about two years and then the third year I went over there and finished my Master's.

06:45.236 --> 06:48.500
What was it like those two years to be by yourself?

06:48.520 --> 06:49.321
Oh it was great fun.

06:49.962 --> 06:51.784
I had never lived like that before.

06:52.806 --> 06:54.868
Here I was a married woman.

06:54.908 --> 06:59.935
I'd never been living very much of a busy married life before.

07:00.404 --> 07:09.033
And I had so many neighbors, everybody was nice, everybody had coffees every morning, and we got together with a whole group of people.

07:10.735 --> 07:17.002
I was with the wives, of course, the Schlesemanns, whom you probably remember, and all that older group.

07:17.362 --> 07:20.525
Skipper, what was Mrs. Schlesemann's name, do you remember?

07:20.706 --> 07:22.327
I remember him as Skipper.

07:22.547 --> 07:23.529
He's Skipper.

07:23.549 --> 07:24.530
And geography.

07:24.550 --> 07:24.830
Oh, Gwen.

07:25.130 --> 07:25.551
Gwen.

07:25.571 --> 07:25.871
Gwen.

07:26.672 --> 07:29.635
Who else were among the most thoughtful to you?

07:30.475 --> 07:31.478
the most kind.

07:31.578 --> 07:43.270
You know, one of the nicest people whose name I cannot remember, I've been trying to remember it, when we first came here was a very, very nice Jewish lady.

07:43.823 --> 07:52.534
whose uncle or father or somebody was a prominent rabbi in New York, who was just the sweetest thing.

07:52.574 --> 07:55.718
She invited all the newcomers to her house.

07:56.219 --> 07:56.919
She fed us.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.423
She amused us.

07:59.983 --> 08:06.431
That was at the time when Dr. Morgan was head of the English department with his wife Anna.

08:06.952 --> 08:08.754
And they had all of us together all the time.

08:08.774 --> 08:13.240
They were so friendly, but I cannot remember her name.

08:14.671 --> 08:18.440
At first I thought, what am I going to do with my time?

08:18.460 --> 08:21.727
I never had a lot of leisure time.

08:22.328 --> 08:28.001
I went to school, and then I went to college, and then I got married and had a job.

08:28.562 --> 08:33.253
All of a sudden here I will have no job.

08:35.107 --> 08:38.031
That sort of worked out very well, though I had a good time.

08:38.792 --> 08:45.803
After I went to Austin and got my master's degree, and then I finished writing my thesis, one thing and another.

08:46.183 --> 08:51.711
Time went very quickly, and by the late 50s I was employed as a teacher.

08:52.112 --> 08:52.352
Where?

08:53.414 --> 08:54.295
In Bryan.

08:56.518 --> 08:57.199
What was your salary?

08:57.652 --> 08:59.396
Oh God I don't remember.

08:59.416 --> 09:01.000
I really don't.

09:01.421 --> 09:05.351
I also taught for four years, five years at Allen Academy.

09:07.015 --> 09:09.902
Teaching English or language?

09:10.463 --> 09:13.230
Latin and French.

09:14.189 --> 09:20.957
And Latin was never one of my strong areas, but they needed a Latin teacher, and I wanted a job, so.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.321
And your husband's department was what?

09:24.641 --> 09:25.062
English.

09:25.102 --> 09:26.183
English, yes.

09:26.223 --> 09:27.805
Now, we were divorced in 67.

09:28.346 --> 09:28.666
Okay.

09:29.067 --> 09:31.970
And he passed away in 78, so he's oldest.

09:31.990 --> 09:34.994
All right, so you had the four children.

09:35.234 --> 09:36.195
I had the four children.

09:37.116 --> 09:41.381
And where did you live after that first little house?

09:41.501 --> 09:42.863
After that first house,

09:44.210 --> 09:50.439
We lived in the country for a while.

09:52.402 --> 09:59.373
And after that, we lived on Dexter, West Dexter, in the house that Ernest Langford had built for himself.

09:59.953 --> 10:03.419
When they retired, the house came on the market, and we got it.

10:04.961 --> 10:06.824
And we stayed in there for a number of years.

10:07.505 --> 10:12.512
And at that point, we were divorced.

10:12.762 --> 10:17.748
And I moved with my children into a house on Glade.

10:18.609 --> 10:27.039
Now, I remember one time Fred Benson said way, way back that divorce was frowned on here.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.663
Did anybody give you any difference?

10:30.844 --> 10:37.331
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm concerned about what Dean Hubbard would say.

10:37.351 --> 10:38.753
But actually,

10:39.728 --> 10:41.450
Everybody just seemed to accept it.

10:41.731 --> 10:42.592
It wasn't too bad.

10:42.612 --> 10:43.974
Now, you were on the faculty?

10:44.454 --> 10:45.736
I was on the faculty.

10:46.757 --> 10:52.265
Particularly, I'd like to know, describe how you came to be an A&M faculty member.

10:52.705 --> 10:53.807
Did you seek them?

10:53.847 --> 10:54.808
Did they seek you?

10:54.868 --> 10:55.149
No.

10:55.609 --> 10:56.590
This was interesting.

10:57.512 --> 11:06.023
One summer, must have been 64, Jack Dabbs called me.

11:06.222 --> 11:21.655
He was then the head of the Modern Language Department, and said he was looking for somebody to teach two courses in summer school in French for the PhD people, reading course.

11:22.175 --> 11:23.837
Would I be interested in doing that?

11:24.617 --> 11:30.202
And I had no summer job, so I said, sure, that'd be interesting because I had to do it.

11:31.844 --> 11:36.027
At the end of the summer, I was fully expecting to go back to Allen Academy.

11:36.833 --> 11:56.292
These were all PhD candidates, presented somebody, whoever the dean was at the time, with a petition saying, I was such an outstanding teacher that the university would be stupid to let me go.

11:57.894 --> 12:04.140
Apparently, Dean Hubert and Dr. Dabbs and whoever else got together and offered me a position.

12:04.525 --> 12:06.909
Do you remember what the salary offer was at your beginning?

12:06.929 --> 12:07.050
Yes.

12:07.611 --> 12:09.514
That I always remember.

12:09.975 --> 12:11.478
My first year I made $6,600.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.942
And this is 64?

12:14.784 --> 12:15.325
That was 64.

12:15.345 --> 12:16.407
64.

12:17.168 --> 12:18.491
And your title was?

12:19.212 --> 12:21.336
Assistant Professor.

12:21.637 --> 12:26.446
Because in history Dr. Nance made us spend three years as an instructor.

12:28.129 --> 12:31.656
I sort of was able to do that because they wanted me.

12:32.437 --> 12:36.224
I don't think I would have been able to do that otherwise.

12:36.745 --> 12:42.396
Now as far as you were aware then, did it matter at all that you were a woman?

12:44.688 --> 12:47.731
This wasn't a... I never felt that it was, really.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.373
I was never made to feel that.

12:49.694 --> 12:53.318
In other words, it wasn't... You know, we're always aware of the fact it might happen.

12:53.458 --> 12:53.858
Of course.

12:53.979 --> 12:56.922
But it really didn't.

12:56.942 --> 13:03.750
Describe, as you joined the department then named Modern Languages, describe who was in the department then.

13:04.490 --> 13:08.895
In the department, believe it or not, we already had some women.

13:09.516 --> 13:12.079
But they were part-time lecturers.

13:12.599 --> 13:18.888
I was the first woman to go in there with tenure rank or whatever, tenure track.

13:19.829 --> 13:24.095
And it was a very small department.

13:24.936 --> 13:31.164
There were about two or three part-timer women and half a dozen were sold.

13:32.326 --> 13:33.848
And taught what languages?

13:34.030 --> 13:37.657
I at that time taught both French and German.

13:37.677 --> 13:39.941
And the department then also taught what else?

13:40.361 --> 13:40.882
Spanish?

13:41.103 --> 13:44.088
Spanish, French, and German, that was about it.

13:44.229 --> 13:45.330
No Latin.

13:45.351 --> 13:46.432
No Latin name, no.

13:46.653 --> 13:53.205
And they taught Czech occasionally because of the Scrivani brothers.

13:54.247 --> 13:55.549
It was not a regular

13:56.238 --> 13:56.859
every year.

13:56.979 --> 13:59.362
No Asian languages at all?

13:59.883 --> 14:00.503
Nothing else.

14:01.284 --> 14:03.347
No Greek, no Latin.

14:03.367 --> 14:08.433
Was there an undergraduate degree major available then?

14:08.493 --> 14:13.099
There was in French and Spanish.

14:15.142 --> 14:20.288
Describe in general what students took the courses.

14:20.977 --> 14:23.119
we still have a good many requirements.

14:24.181 --> 14:39.898
The students in, before college broke up into science, education, and liberal arts, had a foreign language requirement, two years of one foreign language.

14:40.519 --> 14:41.900
We got a lot of those.

14:43.382 --> 14:48.688
And we also had many of those PhD candidates.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.711
And they took some formal courses?

14:51.051 --> 14:52.693
Formal courses.

14:53.554 --> 14:55.656
Were there many majoring in language?

14:56.077 --> 14:56.917
No, very few.

14:57.278 --> 14:58.139
Very, very few.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.560
And no master's degree?

15:00.001 --> 15:04.606
At that point, no, but the master's in Spanish came fairly early.

15:04.826 --> 15:05.106
Really?

15:05.567 --> 15:07.088
Do you remember how that came about?

15:07.769 --> 15:09.751
I wasn't really involved in that.

15:10.852 --> 15:15.277
Number one, I was still a lowly assistant professor.

15:15.758 --> 15:18.000
Number two, I wasn't in the Spanish section.

15:18.588 --> 15:26.941
And was the impetus for that master's degree, did it come from within the department or did it come from above?

15:27.101 --> 15:28.183
It came from within.

15:28.583 --> 15:28.884
Within?

15:29.344 --> 15:29.444
Yeah.

15:29.464 --> 15:31.588
Was there any opposition as far as you know?

15:32.809 --> 15:37.216
Well, there was some opposition on the part of the coordinating board.

15:37.236 --> 15:38.698
Oh, okay.

15:38.718 --> 15:42.624
Who were the key people that made it happen?

15:42.644 --> 15:45.068
There was a gentleman named Jim Ward.

15:45.605 --> 15:51.794
I don't remember much, I don't know where he is, except that he went from here to Puerto Rico.

15:54.357 --> 16:02.589
And there were Jack Dabbs himself across Bush.

16:03.270 --> 16:04.131
Excuse me.

16:04.652 --> 16:11.241
Wait a second.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.917
Got it, thank you.

16:13.937 --> 16:14.618
I don't want to stop talking here.

16:14.638 --> 16:15.879
Of course.

16:15.899 --> 16:16.500
That's all right.

16:17.281 --> 16:18.363
My brain wasn't working.

16:21.567 --> 16:25.072
Can I bring you a glass of water?

16:25.092 --> 16:29.338
How about that graduate program and how it came to be?

16:31.261 --> 16:36.288
The graduate program in Spanish really took off very, very slowly.

16:38.151 --> 16:39.793
It picked up

16:40.060 --> 16:42.703
a good deal after I retired.

16:42.723 --> 16:50.552
I heard from various former colleagues, but for a long time it sort of limped along.

16:51.674 --> 16:57.581
And were there some graduate students very quickly after it was approved?

16:58.822 --> 16:59.963
No, that was the problem.

17:00.304 --> 17:01.285
Oh.

17:01.305 --> 17:06.211
We had the program, but we really didn't have enough students for it.

17:06.231 --> 17:09.915
And Dean Hubert, was he still?

17:10.250 --> 17:13.334
No, by that time, Dean Maxwell was there.

17:13.354 --> 17:16.899
Dean Maxwell, and I'm assuming that he was supportive of it.

17:16.919 --> 17:18.501
He was very supportive.

17:18.521 --> 17:24.730
Dave was very supportive of innovation, particularly in my department.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.713
He didn't get along well with check baths.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.296
Ah.

17:29.316 --> 17:34.063
As you were a beginning faculty member,

17:34.398 --> 17:40.468
Did anyone ever come to you and give you advice as a young, new faculty member?

17:40.828 --> 17:40.988
No.

17:41.589 --> 17:41.810
No?

17:42.952 --> 17:51.445
But you know, I grew up with a father who wasn't academic, a husband who wasn't academic.

17:52.167 --> 17:56.152
A father-in-law was also an academic.

17:56.172 --> 18:00.478
He taught Scandinavian languages at the University of Nebraska for years.

18:01.359 --> 18:04.683
So I was pretty much into that.

18:06.225 --> 18:11.732
In those early years of your faculty assignment, what were your teaching responsibilities?

18:11.792 --> 18:15.357
What courses normally did you teach, and what was the normal load?

18:15.377 --> 18:17.820
We had terrible, terrible teaching loads.

18:18.779 --> 18:24.446
I remember teaching 18 semester hours, one hard one semester, 21.

18:25.747 --> 18:28.451
Nobody thought anything of it, you know.

18:28.511 --> 18:31.014
Jack would just give me my schedule and here you are.

18:31.454 --> 18:33.757
And what courses were they most often?

18:34.979 --> 18:39.744
Mostly the very introductory first and second year language.

18:40.105 --> 18:41.226
Spanish and French?

18:41.560 --> 18:43.423
French and German.

18:43.443 --> 18:44.505
Oh, French and German.

18:44.605 --> 18:45.346
French and German.

18:45.406 --> 18:47.990
My Spanish isn't good enough to do anything well.

18:48.070 --> 18:52.057
What about, did you get to teach some junior, senior?

18:53.379 --> 18:54.280
I did after a while.

18:54.981 --> 19:00.790
Again, we had to, basically my teaching field is French.

19:01.632 --> 19:03.535
French literature, language and literature.

19:04.757 --> 19:06.319
We had to build up enough

19:07.700 --> 19:11.888
students to get into the upper level courses.

19:11.908 --> 19:16.937
And then we started, we added junior and senior level courses, and I taught those regularly.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.361
And that began to happen in the late 60s?

19:21.685 --> 19:22.286
Just about.

19:22.306 --> 19:22.968
Okay.

19:24.110 --> 19:31.643
And you all were quartered, your offices were then on the first floor of the academic?

19:31.783 --> 19:32.104
Right.

19:33.468 --> 19:38.438
And we got moved back and forth, but it was always on the first floor of the academic building.

19:39.339 --> 19:44.249
You remember there used to be that big parking lot behind the academic?

19:44.269 --> 19:46.734
I could sit at my desk and see my car.

19:47.635 --> 19:49.038
Then they took the lot away.

19:49.339 --> 19:51.122
My car went somewhere else.

19:51.777 --> 20:00.450
But we went somewhere else, and we went to the other end where the dean's office had been originally, because Dean Maxwell moved into Harrington.

20:01.251 --> 20:06.139
And who were your closest faculty friends and associates in those years?

20:08.443 --> 20:09.144
In those years?

20:11.327 --> 20:17.937
Well, I was close to, let's see,

20:19.773 --> 20:37.765
Some of the people that we hired during those years mainly, because the old timers, now from my current status of old timer, I can laugh at it, but there were basically three or four

20:38.993 --> 20:41.099
elderly senior full professors.

20:42.002 --> 20:50.829
Jack Dabbs, Ed Breitenkamp, and Jay Skrivarnik, and I lost somebody somewhere.

20:51.812 --> 20:53.256
And I never was very

20:54.569 --> 20:56.711
socially or in any other way involved with them.

20:56.731 --> 21:05.061
We had good professional relationships, but they were so much older than I was at the time that there wasn't much there.

21:05.421 --> 21:14.591
But some of my very good friends still were the—what do you call them?

21:15.773 --> 21:16.614
Think of their names.

21:17.434 --> 21:24.222
They were all people who had joined the faculty relatively recently.

21:24.488 --> 21:25.409
newer people.

21:28.194 --> 21:44.119
Some of them have not fared too well lately at A&M, but anyway, the Nodos, N-A-U-D-E-A-U, were very nice people from France.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.601
Well, he's from France, he's not.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.247
They came into the department and

21:51.269 --> 21:56.415
After that we began sort of having a different group, grouping.

21:57.356 --> 21:59.939
Did the department have social activities together?

21:59.980 --> 22:01.141
Yes, quite a lot.

22:02.423 --> 22:18.542
Well actually some of the people that I associated the most with were the Koepkes, because Wolf Koepke was, he came from Rice, along with two other people, Hans Popper and Lee Stabenhagen.

22:19.028 --> 22:22.999
But I was never that close to those two, but I was very close to Wolf.

22:23.360 --> 22:35.012
Wolf was sort of became, by dint of accomplishment, I think, in personality, the senior man in the department.

22:35.498 --> 22:41.731
Now, after Dr. Dabbs as department head, who was the... I was.

22:42.071 --> 22:43.053
I came in right after Jeff.

22:43.214 --> 22:43.735
Oh, you did?

22:44.075 --> 22:44.637
In what year?

22:45.839 --> 22:47.743
Uh, 73.

22:48.104 --> 22:49.687
So he served many years.

22:50.028 --> 22:50.248
Yep.

22:50.869 --> 22:51.270
Many years.

22:51.290 --> 22:53.114
Well, he stayed and taught a couple more years.

22:53.134 --> 22:55.178
But, I mean, he had been the department head for...

22:55.968 --> 23:03.619
You know, since the founding of A&M, they had, up to that point, only been three department heads.

23:03.699 --> 23:04.700
Oh, that's marvelous.

23:04.881 --> 23:06.022
I'm glad you mentioned that.

23:06.663 --> 23:07.384
That's remarkable.

23:07.404 --> 23:14.234
Joe Wolcott, Dr. Campbell, Joe I knew, Campbell I didn't know, and Jack Dabbs.

23:14.555 --> 23:18.941
Jersey Joe Wolcott, W-O-O-L-K-E-T.

23:19.962 --> 23:22.566
And I was number four.

23:23.997 --> 23:26.302
In the 70s, mind you.

23:26.322 --> 23:34.197
All right, as you began, what kind of library quality did we have?

23:34.738 --> 23:37.183
I'm not sure you want to hear this.

23:37.203 --> 23:39.207
No, it was pitiful, I think.

23:39.367 --> 23:46.461
Pitiful, absolutely pitiful, and it stayed pitiful until I retired.

23:47.825 --> 23:51.008
Not on particularly good terms with Irene.

23:52.309 --> 24:01.118
She was already thinking very much in terms of technology and if you don't need all this stuff, you can do it on the computer, you know.

24:01.759 --> 24:11.848
And I said, I want my students, my literature students, to be able to browse, to pick up a book, open it, and see what it looks like to see a French page.

24:11.928 --> 24:15.672
You know, they've never seen it.

24:17.086 --> 24:22.057
We did not, as far as research goes, that was a zilch.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.645
But there wasn't really enough for the undergraduates.

24:26.167 --> 24:35.668
So we kept trying to eventually build up a fairly good body of books for the undergraduates.

24:36.357 --> 24:46.151
Now, in the department, within the department, was there particular competition between the Spanish, the French, the German?

24:46.231 --> 24:47.813
For books?

24:47.833 --> 24:48.775
Or for anything?

24:50.096 --> 24:51.498
No, not really.

24:52.560 --> 24:57.126
We pretty much went our own way, which was good, otherwise there would have been more clashes.

24:57.146 --> 25:03.175
And there was not a feeling that this language is getting more emphasis than it deserves?

25:03.273 --> 25:06.729
I was never able to pinpoint that.

25:06.829 --> 25:10.566
Nobody ever mentioned it.

25:10.968 --> 25:15.934
faculty member come and say, well, Spanish is getting all this and German is not.

25:16.595 --> 25:17.576
That never happened.

25:17.997 --> 25:24.746
As far as you recall, down through the years, which language generated more student credit hours?

25:25.326 --> 25:25.767
Spanish.

25:25.847 --> 25:26.348
Spanish.

25:26.388 --> 25:26.808
Spanish.

25:27.770 --> 25:28.771
And then French?

25:29.352 --> 25:30.853
And then French.

25:30.873 --> 25:34.378
I forgot to mention, we also taught Russian.

25:34.398 --> 25:34.598
Oh.

25:35.159 --> 25:35.980
I forgot that.

25:36.770 --> 25:47.527
Again, that limped along for quite a while, and eventually we got some really good people on the faculty for Russian, and it picked up.

25:48.248 --> 25:52.956
Who were those Russian additions?

25:55.096 --> 25:55.517
Gosh.

25:56.619 --> 25:58.142
I'm getting very bad on them.

25:58.162 --> 25:59.685
Well, we'll get that in the second edition.

25:59.705 --> 26:00.887
First name is Olga.

26:00.907 --> 26:02.370
She's still on the property.

26:03.672 --> 26:04.794
And Olga somebody.

26:05.937 --> 26:07.179
She and her husband are both on.

26:07.580 --> 26:15.354
She is a very interesting, very, very nice person, born in Paris, of Russian parents.

26:16.537 --> 26:17.779
So she came

26:18.873 --> 26:19.995
up bilingually.

26:20.896 --> 26:23.379
Married an American, her English is flawless.

26:23.599 --> 26:25.943
You'd never know she was Native.

26:30.889 --> 26:34.374
So that became a much more interesting area.

26:37.158 --> 26:42.605
Did you all ever propose to add some language that was?

26:43.326 --> 26:44.147
Yes.

26:44.508 --> 26:45.309
Repeatedly.

26:46.310 --> 26:48.593
What languages did you all propose that were turned down?

26:49.450 --> 26:50.512
Well, let's see.

26:50.552 --> 26:58.843
At one time we proposed Italian because we had a lot of students of Italian background who wanted to get a year or two of Italian.

26:59.925 --> 27:02.769
And the coordinating board shut that one down.

27:03.049 --> 27:03.450
Really?

27:03.770 --> 27:06.334
And said Italian is being taught everywhere else already.

27:06.354 --> 27:06.975
You don't need it.

27:08.016 --> 27:11.982
And it took us a good while.

27:12.653 --> 27:15.138
to get the classical languages approved.

27:15.198 --> 27:19.847
As a matter of fact, Greek didn't get approved until after I had retired.

27:20.989 --> 27:33.353
And we've been trying for a long time because we seem to have had some interest from students who wanted to go to a seminary and who wanted to have the Latin and the Greek.

27:33.373 --> 27:34.375
And I never quite

27:34.777 --> 27:41.327
I never felt very certain that we would have had enough students to really fill classes for that.

27:42.048 --> 27:44.993
But there was some demand, definitely.

27:47.257 --> 27:59.496
When you were a young faculty member, before you became department head, if you felt you needed advice on something, to whom did you turn for advice and counsel?

28:00.918 --> 28:02.100
Well, let's see.

28:06.265 --> 28:16.783
To be honest, probably to my husband, because he had been on the faculty much longer than I had, and knew his way around better than I did.

28:17.805 --> 28:23.655
And you said no one came to you and gave you advice about how to be an A&M faculty?

28:23.675 --> 28:23.735
No.

28:24.296 --> 28:25.177
No.

28:25.197 --> 28:29.004
What did you think was appropriate for you in terms of dress?

28:29.805 --> 28:31.969
Well, that was interesting.

28:33.518 --> 28:41.085
I have always, my whole life, I think I'm basically a conservative person in dress, at least.

28:41.105 --> 28:48.512
And I've always dressed, you know, conservatively for work.

28:48.592 --> 28:49.573
I never wore pants.

28:51.094 --> 29:01.804
That was something that happened about that time around the early 70s, 74, 75, I had a delegation of two of my faculty members

29:02.020 --> 29:08.949
female faculty members, coming and asking me what I thought might happen if we wore pants.

29:10.010 --> 29:11.933
And by that time, things had loosened up.

29:11.953 --> 29:18.942
And I said, as far as I'm concerned, no jeans, no blue jeans, but pants, pantsuits, fine.

29:19.603 --> 29:21.846
So they all started doing nothing.

29:21.866 --> 29:24.990
I really never did until much, much later.

29:25.350 --> 29:27.613
And of course, no shorts for faculty.

29:27.633 --> 29:27.854
Oh, gosh.

29:28.695 --> 29:30.277
Who ever heard of it?

29:30.297 --> 29:31.318
And no sandals.

29:31.703 --> 29:35.366
We had one interesting experience.

29:35.947 --> 29:48.359
There's one gentleman with whom him and his wife became very good friends, the Costas, who became department head after me.

29:50.921 --> 29:57.468
Luis had been teaching at Vassar, and he came here for his interview.

29:58.589 --> 30:00.090
I can see him today.

30:00.458 --> 30:05.267
bare feet, sandals, long hair, huge beard all over.

30:05.908 --> 30:08.693
And you know, it was kind of funny.

30:09.775 --> 30:15.386
I liked him from the beginning, even though his appearance wasn't very promising.

30:16.327 --> 30:18.531
And David Maxwell didn't care for him at all.

30:19.593 --> 30:24.222
Finally, the faculty voted to offer him a position.

30:25.062 --> 30:30.670
And I was talking to David about it, and David said, well, you can have him if you want to, but I don't think you're getting much.

30:33.133 --> 30:41.444
So now, well, now, even 15 years ago, you wouldn't have recognized that young man.

30:41.925 --> 30:46.531
He is the best dressed, best looking young man you can find anywhere.

30:46.551 --> 30:48.634
He still has a beard, neatly trimmed.

30:49.475 --> 30:52.099
He's the one who once came to me and said,

30:52.568 --> 30:56.580
would you do something about Joe somebody who was a teaching assistant?

30:57.362 --> 30:58.064
And I said, why?

30:58.124 --> 30:59.267
What?

30:59.288 --> 31:01.534
He said, you notice how grody he looks?

31:02.758 --> 31:03.881
I just nearly died.

31:05.104 --> 31:07.371
And I just said, you know, Luis?
