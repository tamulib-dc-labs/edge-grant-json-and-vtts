00:02.039 --> 00:11.358
This is an interview with Major General Thomas 
Darling by Tara Pressnell on April 25, 1991 at

00:02.039 --> 00:11.358
General Darling's office concerning Vietnam. In 
the interest of accumulating knowledge, I am

00:11.378 --> 00:19.074
asking you to donate this tape to me or to the Texas 
A&M Oral History Collection in the University

00:11.378 --> 00:19.074
Archives. Is that alright with you? Yes, that's 
fine.

00:26.947 --> 00:33.093
For the purpose of this interview, could you 
please give me your date and place of birth and

00:26.947 --> 00:33.093
formal educational background? I was born April 
30, 1932, in Abilene, Texas. I came to Texas A&M in

00:38.458 --> 00:45.704
the fall of 1950, graduated here in 1954, and went 
immediately into the Air Force. While in the Air

00:46.845 --> 00:56.194
Force, I earned a Master of Science in Public

00:46.845 --> 00:56.194
Relations. public administration from George 
Washington University, graduate of the Air Force

00:57.102 --> 01:12.959
Pilot School, the Air Command and Staff College, 
the Squadron Officer Force, and the Naval War

00:57.102 --> 01:12.959
College. What unit were you with and where were you 
based in Southeast Asia? And what was the mission

01:17.204 --> 01:21.128
of the unit that you were assigned to? Well, I was a 
member of a provisional wing. I forget even the

01:23.851 --> 01:27.075
number of that provisional wing. located on the 
island of Guam. Early in the war, when it was

01:31.766 --> 01:43.208
determined that they needed the B-52s for bombing 
in Vietnam, they started sending units on

01:31.766 --> 01:43.208
temporary duty to Guam. We were all put in a wing 
called, like it was a 41-33rd Provisional Wing.

01:49.347 --> 01:57.075
But it ended up with units from across the United 
States supplying elements to that provisional

01:49.347 --> 01:57.075
wing. That's a common organization that was used 
in the Persian Gulf conflict. Many of the Air Force

02:03.060 --> 02:10.868
units were assigned to a provisional wing, 
meaning a temporary wing for the duration of the

02:03.060 --> 02:10.868
war. But I was a member of this provisional wing on 
the island of Guam. elements from several other

02:19.520 --> 02:26.747
bases, stateside bases there when I was there. Say 
again the last part of it. What was the mission at

02:28.889 --> 02:30.811
the unit that you were assigned to? The mission I 
was assigned to was to conduct iron bombing. I

02:41.621 --> 02:43.383
wouldn't call it strategic bombing. I guess it 
would be tactical bombing in support of ground

02:43.443 --> 02:48.548
troops, in South Vietnam primarily. What exactly 
were your responsibilities at Anderson Air Force

02:52.809 --> 02:57.514
Base in Guam? I was a B-52 aircraft commander. I had 
five other members of that crew and we were an

03:01.659 --> 03:07.746
integral unit. We trained and worked together and 
we flew over together and we flew missions

03:07.766 --> 03:15.835
together as an integrated crew. I was the aircraft 
commander, the one that was charged with the

03:16.777 --> 03:33.399
training, flying missions, the effectiveness of 
that crew, putting the bombs on the target, if you

03:16.777 --> 03:33.399
will. Did you volunteer for duty in Vietnam? Well, 
I went willingly. You know, I was not given a chance

03:40.688 --> 03:45.794
to hold up my hand or sign something to say I wanted 
to go. I was gone. I was over there before that even

03:46.254 --> 03:48.757
really came in, really. Later in the war, people 
had many opportunities to volunteer, and a lot of

03:49.257 --> 04:07.017
people did, but I was over there in early 1966 
before, well, in the early stages of the program,

03:49.257 --> 04:07.017
so while I went willingly, I guess you'd say 
voluntarily, it really was not... something that

04:07.418 --> 04:12.947
I had an opportunity to say whether I wanted to go or 
not. How often were you flying combat missions in

04:12.967 --> 04:16.793
Southeast Asia? We would fly at least every third 
day. I was there for about 180 days during that time

04:22.762 --> 04:30.574
that I was assigned to the 4133rd Provisional 
Wing. We would sometimes pull spare. They had to

04:34.496 --> 04:37.060
spare each. They provided at least two or three 
spare aircraft and crews for each day's mission.

04:42.146 --> 04:56.123
If one of the airplanes that was scheduled to go 
couldn't make it for some reason, had a mechanical

04:42.146 --> 04:56.123
problem, couldn't take off, or had to abort and 
return, then a spare aircraft would be sent to take

04:42.146 --> 04:56.123
its place, a spare aircraft and crew. So we pulled 
spare or actually flew a mission usually about

04:57.166 --> 05:04.395
every other day. Did any of your missions 
originate from bases other than Guam? I don't

05:10.162 --> 05:11.183
believe so. We had to divert sometimes for 
weather, but I don't believe I actually flew a

05:13.005 --> 05:22.237
mission from any base other than on the island of 
Guam. Now, later on in the war, other bases were

05:22.837 --> 05:26.582
brought in. Thailand became a very popular base. 
In fact, most of the sorties were launched from

05:30.374 --> 05:35.559
bases in Thailand rather than Guam. Guam was such a 
distance away, it made it a very grueling mission.

05:44.048 --> 05:53.717
It was a 12-hour mission at least and an 18- to 
20-hour day, the time you consider pre-flight

05:44.048 --> 05:53.717
mission planning. Briefings, takeoff, return, 
debriefing, and all of that. So crews could only

05:59.050 --> 06:06.098
fly, and airplanes could only fly so many sorties 
in a given period of time. So it was advantageous to

06:06.118 --> 06:14.266
move the bases closer in, move the bases closer in 
so that more sorties could be flown. But that was a

06:14.286 --> 06:18.591
problem at Guam, just being such a great distance 
from the target area. Would you describe in depth

06:19.887 --> 06:25.352
the typical combat mission in a B-52 from 
beginning to end? Okay, I did a little of that, but

06:25.372 --> 06:29.236
let me start over. Most of the missions that I flew, 
the takeoff was from 3 to 5 o'clock in the

06:29.256 --> 06:38.984
morning. That was all designed to put us over the 
target area at the desired time. But we would take

06:44.209 --> 06:47.312
off, well, we'd start with... With a meal in the 
dining hall there, it would usually be three to

06:48.608 --> 06:59.182
four hours in advance of our takeoff time. We'd eat 
a meal, and then we would go to our briefings. Those

07:04.008 --> 07:05.930
would last 30 to 40 minutes. We'd have the 
operations briefing, the weather briefing. a lot

07:13.634 --> 07:15.136
of other briefings. We'd have the individual cell 
briefings where each group of crews that were

07:15.877 --> 07:23.709
flying in a cell together would have their own 
briefings. We'd always close with the chaplain,

07:24.009 --> 07:29.878
his comments and a prayer. And then we would go to 
our airplanes, pre-flight those airplanes, and

07:29.898 --> 07:40.654
at a given time we would start engines and taxi out 
of position and take off. And then, as I say, the

07:41.242 --> 07:47.451
takeoff was all 3 to 5 o'clock in the morning. A lot 
of 4 o'clock takeoffs, I remember. But we would

07:50.855 --> 07:58.646
take off, and it was about six hours en route to 
Vietnam, to the target area. And en route to about

07:58.666 --> 08:06.237
three hours out, we'd conduct one aerial 
refueling, because we needed that fuel to get to

07:58.666 --> 08:06.237
the target area and back. We'd usually meet a 
tanker out of the Kadena Air Base, which is located

08:06.622 --> 08:14.856
on the island of Okinawa. The tankers would come up 
and we'd rendezvous with them and usually take on

08:14.876 --> 08:23.712
100 to 120,000 pounds of fuel. That would enable us 
to fly the mission through the tactics that were

08:23.732 --> 08:30.604
required at the return home. Again, about a 
12-hour, 12-and-a-half-hour mission. But we

08:35.292 --> 08:43.844
were loaded with bombs, which limited the amount 
of fuel that you could have on board. An airplane

08:43.864 --> 08:46.628
can only take off a certain weight. We usually took 
off in the particular airplane that I flew at about

08:46.828 --> 08:51.455
450,000 pounds. And 60,000

08:51.796 --> 08:57.684
pounds or so of that would be bombs. So we couldn't 
take off with all the fuel that the airplane would

09:00.284 --> 09:12.160
hold because with the bombs we would exceed the max 
weight

09:00.284 --> 09:12.160
that we could actually get airborne. And on the 
island of Guam, which is very hot and humid, not a

09:12.180 --> 09:24.417
very good environment there

09:12.180 --> 09:24.417
for maximum performance from an airplane, a jet 
engine. It's better performance in cool, dry

09:24.437 --> 09:27.321
conditions. So we needed all the runway there to 
get off at the loads that we took off. But anyway,

09:32.101 --> 09:49.667
back to where I started, we would get that 
refueling and then we would press on usually over,

09:32.101 --> 09:49.667
we would take off from Guam and head toward, 
generally in the direction of Okinawa, refuel and

09:32.101 --> 09:49.667
then from there head toward South Vietnam. And 
usually we'd come in from over the South China Sea

09:55.128 --> 10:02.601
And targets were from southern Vietnam, even 
bombed in Laos a couple of times.

10:08.972 --> 10:16.164
And that would take us about six hours into the 
mission.

10:16.184 --> 10:19.971
The bomb run was, of course, the most critical part 
of the mission. to be lined up on the proper axis

10:20.423 --> 10:25.409
that they had planned for you to fly in on. We had to 
have exact spacing and distance from the

10:27.332 --> 10:33.119
airplanes in front to the side of us. But each crew 
had to make an individual drop. That was the

10:38.625 --> 10:41.729
scheduled way to drop. There were emergency ways 
where we could drop from the airplane in front of us

10:41.749 --> 10:48.017
in case we were having system malfunctions. But 
generally, we dropped individually. But these

10:52.213 --> 10:58.200
missions were all designed to achieve a certain 
pattern with bombs. We were scheduled to drop

10:58.220 --> 11:00.282
inside of a box. And we knew what that box was. Of 
course, we tried hard to always make sure we were in

11:04.367 --> 11:08.311
that box. One thing, we did not drop unless we had 
positive contact with the target that we were

11:08.331 --> 11:16.080
dropping on. just to make random drops. You had to 
be certain of what you were bombing or you didn't

11:19.468 --> 11:23.471
drop bombs. That's very important. But the run 
into the target from the coast would be a 30, 40

11:29.337 --> 11:45.932
minute period, roughly from the time we coasted 
in, penetrated the area, and dropped our bombs,

11:29.337 --> 11:45.932
did our maneuvers, and returned to the coast. But 
that was the critical period when everything

11:46.368 --> 11:53.917
became quite intense. Then on the return flight, 
we'd fly straight back to the island of Guam,

11:54.778 --> 12:01.806
flying over the Philippines. We'd usually fly at 
43,000, 44,000 feet to conserve fuel by airplane,

12:01.826 --> 12:12.418
getting better fuel performance at higher 
altitudes. So we had to do that to get home. A lot of

12:14.870 --> 12:18.374
weather, usually both going and coming to skirt.

12:21.698 --> 12:27.465
But we, again, tried to maintain the formation, 
the cell as we called it. We took off in cell, we

12:27.485 --> 12:33.032
bombed in cell, we returned in cell, we landed in 
cell formation. Again, a mission that usually was

12:34.153 --> 12:39.780
12 to 12 and a half hours long, and after that we 
would taxi and unload our equipment and go into a

12:40.182 --> 12:45.176
debriefing that was very extensive. It took 
considerable time. They asked us questions. We

12:49.367 --> 12:52.335
had to fill out forms pertaining to the mission. 
and what we encountered from radars to what we saw

12:52.535 --> 13:05.757
in the target area, any other things that we 
observed, the general intelligence

12:52.535 --> 13:05.757
fact-finding kind of debriefing that we went 
through. Also, we had to be debriefed about the

13:06.017 --> 13:14.351
equipment on the airplane, the systems, what 
malfunctioned, any problems that we had. A lot of

13:15.012 --> 13:19.099
paperwork to fill out, and that usually took an 
hour and a half or so to do all of that.

13:27.232 --> 13:35.622
And then

13:27.232 --> 13:35.622
we were free to go on in our barracks area if they 
don't want. That's a typical mission. At the time

13:36.163 --> 13:42.151
that you were flying combat missions, how much 
leeway and choosing targets were commanders

13:36.163 --> 13:42.151
given? Very little.

13:46.777 --> 13:47.618
There were I can't recall a time that I had any 
leeway on the target that we were to bomb with maybe

13:48.543 --> 13:59.877
this exception. If there was weather in the area 
that would preclude us from hitting the target, we

14:00.177 --> 14:08.728
might have been given secondary targets that we 
could go and strike. But it was a matter of me

14:09.189 --> 14:14.415
determining the weather was too severe for us to go 
to the original target, and we might have to go to an

14:14.935 --> 14:20.182
alternate target, which we'd already been given. 
But we were not given the latitude to select the

14:20.202 --> 14:25.309
targets on our own. That's not our option, at least 
not during the time that I was there. In relation to

14:33.019 --> 14:40.488
that question, could you give specific examples 
of targets that Johnson or Nixon disapproved, and

14:33.019 --> 14:40.488
why? That they disapproved? You know, at my level, 
I really didn't know that. I know that mission

14:49.976 --> 14:58.871
tasking sometimes at least appeared to come from 
back home somewhere. And I know that the targets we

14:58.891 --> 15:04.180
struck were very, very tightly controlled, and a 
lot of it was developed for reasons that we didn't

15:04.733 --> 15:15.804
even understand or weren't even aware of what all 
went into the selection of the targets. As a young

15:15.824 --> 15:26.354
crew member, my job was to take a mission that I'd 
been assigned and go do that, and I really didn't

15:15.824 --> 15:26.354
understand or know how a lot of that came about. But 
it was my feeling that a lot of that was determined

15:27.195 --> 15:34.622
at very high levels. Did you receive training in 
Vietnamese culture before going to Vietnam? Oh, a

15:40.373 --> 15:41.135
little bit. Not very much. Again, our going was 
kind of a hasty move. The whole unity of the wing

15:46.705 --> 15:55.242
that I was assigned to back in the States was told on 
fairly short notice that we would be deploying.

15:55.462 --> 15:57.927
Again, I was in the fairly early stages of the war. 
So we really didn't have time to get a whole lot of

15:58.919 --> 16:03.745
indoctrination. Of course, the other thing, I was 
flying missions from Guam, and I had very little

16:03.765 --> 16:10.553
contact with the enemy. It was interesting, the 
missions that I flew were high altitude missions.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.365
You couldn't really see things that well on the 
ground. And we were bombing an enemy that

16:20.385 --> 16:24.230
essentially I couldn't see. It was kind of an 
impersonal war, in that sense, what I was doing.

16:34.241 --> 16:40.890
What were your perceptions of the Vietnamese 
people as a whole and the leaders of the Army of the

16:34.241 --> 16:40.890
Republic of Vietnam? Well, my impressions of the 
Vietnamese, again, I didn't have that much

16:40.910 --> 16:45.257
contact with them. I did see them

16:45.277 --> 16:53.890
back in the States in places over the period of the 
war. You know, I generally had...

16:59.990 --> 17:05.419
in high regard for the Vietnamese that I 
encountered during those four years. Again, I

17:05.439 --> 17:11.409
didn't encounter them day to day during the war 
because of where I was assigned. The leaders of

17:12.651 --> 17:17.358
Vietnam, I don't know, it's hard to say. Again, I 
wasn't, I was not that directly involved. In your

17:26.045 --> 17:29.629
opinion, what was the overall morale of the unit 
that you were with? And was there a difference in

17:30.009 --> 17:33.733
morale between the officers and the enlisted? I'd 
say the morale of the unit I was assigned was very

17:33.753 --> 17:39.259
high. Again, this was early in the war.

17:44.445 --> 17:51.613
We were, I think, about the second B-52 wing 
involved in the war, the second deployment of B-52

17:44.445 --> 17:51.613
wings. Again, our morale was very high. I think the 
professionalism was very good. The performance

17:59.310 --> 18:02.895
was outstanding.

18:03.496 --> 18:15.652
And I could cite many examples of what I could say 
was an outstanding

18:03.496 --> 18:15.652
performance by crews that I flew with. As far as the 
officers listed any difference, I would say the

18:15.672 --> 18:20.098
morale was very high among both. Again, we were in a 
little different situation. We could fly combat

18:25.557 --> 18:30.884
missions and come home and sleep in 
air-conditioned quarters. Food was good. The

18:34.368 --> 18:47.925
thing that sort of got us down, I guess, toward the 
end was the continuation of long, grueling

18:34.368 --> 18:47.925
missions every second or third day that really, 
really wear one out. How would you describe your

18:49.913 --> 18:56.663
assignment with the Strategic Air Command and did 
the activities of the command escalate with the

18:49.913 --> 18:56.663
warranty? What was the first part? How would you 
describe your assignment with the Strategic Air

18:58.086 --> 19:04.676
Command?

19:04.696 --> 19:13.429
Well, that was kind of hard to answer because I 
spent 20 something years with the Strategic Air

19:04.696 --> 19:13.429
Command on and off again. I started in that 
command, I always felt it was a very professional

19:18.112 --> 19:20.636
organization. I think it was the pace setter for 
the Air Force in terms of professionalism and

19:22.239 --> 19:28.470
performance for many years. I think General May 
came in and helped set some very high standards. It

19:35.141 --> 19:38.107
was very demanding. Crews had to perform. Again, I 
think the rest of the Air Force learned a lot from

19:40.724 --> 19:46.651
SAC in those early years. No question in my mind 
about that. I think the rest of the Air Force sort of

19:49.535 --> 19:57.805
caught up with SAC in later years.

19:57.825 --> 20:01.370
But, you know, my regard for SAC was always very 
high. I always felt that the standards were very

20:01.390 --> 20:09.600
high and that the people they had and I think they 
still are. But again, I think many of the SAC

20:13.232 --> 20:20.922
methods and standards were later adopted by the 
rest of the Air Force. Standardization is a good

20:20.942 --> 20:23.446
example. SAC in the early years had 
standardization programs that They were almost

20:29.948 --> 20:35.736
foreign to the rest of the Air Force. But today, 
most Air Force organizations have

20:35.756 --> 20:45.010
standardization programs that follow along the 
lines of what was learned at SAC many years ago. The

20:45.030 --> 20:47.894
last part of the question was? Did the activities 
of the command escalate with the war in Vietnam?

20:51.379 --> 20:52.521
Oh, yes, very much. More and more SAC units were 
added to the conflict. At the end of the campaign, I

20:59.581 --> 21:08.797
can't even recall how many B-52s were involved, 
but it seemed to me like there was an order of 200,

20:59.581 --> 21:08.797
something like that. But the Linebacker II 
operation in December 1972,

21:09.738 --> 21:23.361
I think was the thing that finally brought that 
conflict to an end. Certainly that was a great

21:24.117 --> 21:32.929
escalation of efforts from what it was in the 
earlier years when I

21:24.117 --> 21:32.929
was there. What is your understanding of the 
reasons that the United States got involved

21:32.949 --> 21:44.103
in Vietnam? Well, I think in 1964,

21:44.123 --> 21:51.593
65,

21:52.720 --> 22:04.081
People thought, believed in the domino theory 
that the communists gobbled up one nation and

21:52.720 --> 22:04.081
another was in line to fall. And I think most of us at 
that time felt that we need to draw the line, that we

22:04.101 --> 22:12.737
couldn't afford to give up South Vietnam to the 
communists. They seemed aggressive and seemed to

22:13.291 --> 22:21.039
have the intent of trying to capture the world, if 
you would. And they were determined they weren't

22:21.059 --> 22:24.142
going to be able to do that. I think we really felt 
that the communist world was ready to take another

22:24.162 --> 22:34.352
country into their fold. We didn't want them to do 
that. And I think that's one of the key things that

22:35.273 --> 22:41.739
got us into the war. Of course, there was I think 
other things like shooting at a ship and that sort

22:44.459 --> 23:04.145
of thing that today seem questionable

22:44.459 --> 23:04.145
may be given as the exact reasons that we got into 
that

22:44.459 --> 23:04.145
war. But I think generally we were determined that 
the Communists weren't going to take another

23:04.165 --> 23:07.429
country and move forward. I understand that 
careerism and ticket punching are sometimes

23:09.350 --> 23:17.339
prevalent in the military, and officers serve in 
order to further their own self-interest. Did you

23:17.359 --> 23:20.302
find that to be the case in Vietnam? Well, again, I 
didn't find it the case in the unit that I was

23:20.322 --> 23:29.432
assigned to in 1966. However, I would say that 
there was some of that that went on, perhaps a whole

23:29.452 --> 23:37.821
lot of it went on during the Vietnamese War. I think 
there were a lot of people that went forward, get

23:38.948 --> 23:50.208
their ticket punched, as we say, thinking it was 
forever their career, and I think it did help some

23:38.948 --> 23:50.208
people. Having that combat experience, I think, 
served a lot of people well in later jobs and

23:51.611 --> 24:00.687
responsibilities.

24:03.788 --> 24:11.317
But I didn't observe that in the part of the war in 
the time period that I was there, not in the unit

24:03.788 --> 24:11.317
that I was assigned. I think it became more 
prevalent in some services later on. What did you

24:17.984 --> 24:22.890
think of the one-year tour of duties that were 
served in Vietnam? Well, in hindsight, I think it

24:22.910 --> 24:26.715
was a big mistake. I think we made the mistake of not 
utilizing our reserve forces, not having any kind

24:26.735 --> 24:33.222
of globalization effort. I think the Persian Gulf 
War stands in the contrast where we learned the

24:33.792 --> 24:53.960
lesson of not getting into rotations but to 
mobilize and call up the forces we need and try to

24:33.792 --> 24:53.960
make sure we've had enough to do the job and get on 
with it and get it over with. But I think back in

24:56.203 --> 25:00.930
Vietnam, Presidents then, Johnson, Nixon, They 
wanted to have guns and butter both, as we say. They

25:05.226 --> 25:11.893
wanted to fight the war and have everything fine 
back home and things going normal here. And that

25:11.913 --> 25:15.777
was, I think, the term of the day. A mistake in the 
final analysis. The one-year tour, bad in a number

25:19.601 --> 25:26.909
of ways, in my opinion. One, people have to be 
trained. It takes a while to get them over there.

25:31.994 --> 25:35.039
When they get there, they have to be 
indoctrinated. They have to fly. When I went

25:35.900 --> 25:47.278
there, we had to fly two missions that were 
supervised by experienced crews who'd already

25:35.900 --> 25:47.278
been through what we were going through before we 
could be turned loose to be on our own. But there was

25:47.919 --> 25:52.647
a lot of in-country indoctrination training that 
had to go on. It was some waste of time in the total

25:52.767 --> 25:58.997
scheme of things. Then midway, people are looking 
for the end so they can go home or do something else.

26:07.717 --> 26:19.013
But it caused a lack of continuity in planning and 
leadership and a lot of things. I just think it's a

26:19.194 --> 26:22.459
big mistake. We'd be much better off to have 
mobilized. In your opinion, why was the United

26:23.340 --> 26:28.748
States not successful in the war in Vietnam? Well, 
I think I'd say we were successful in the war,

26:30.517 --> 26:38.344
but maybe barely so.

26:43.348 --> 26:50.295
We had a lot of battles that we lost a lot of people 
in. I think we failed to understand the culture. I

26:53.758 --> 26:58.482
think at least in the early years we thought that we 
did drop a lot of firepower on them and they would

27:00.318 --> 27:11.293
knuckle under and come to see things as we did and it 
would respond accordingly. But I think we found

27:11.314 --> 27:15.059
out there are a lot tougher people fighting in the 
jungles. It was a lot more difficult than fighting

27:15.359 --> 27:23.551
in the sands and rock.

27:23.571 --> 27:24.452
But the people And it shouldn't have been any less 
to us. I think it had been proven before even World

27:27.432 --> 27:30.035
War II. Sometimes the more you bomb people, the 
more hurt you cause on them, the more determined

27:30.375 --> 27:37.604
they become. They had thousands of reserves. They 
were very good at hiding

27:41.728 --> 27:49.517
and doing harassing kind of things to us. We could 
destroy trails and roads. Two days later, they'd

27:54.419 --> 27:58.826
have them restored, and that seemed to be a 
surprise to us. We never could quite figure out how

27:58.846 --> 28:01.490
they could do all this. But they were very good at 
that. We were fighting on their territory,

28:04.354 --> 28:16.112
something that, in their homeland, that they 
understood a lot better than we did, the jungles

28:04.354 --> 28:16.112
and the rivers and all of that. But we never seemed 
to get that figured out until the end, I guess.

28:27.410 --> 28:45.920
While

28:27.410 --> 28:45.920
we thought we could, again, exert enough power and 
force that would cause them to withdraw or

28:27.410 --> 28:45.920
surrender and back up and come to the peace table, 
it never happened until the end of the war. I think

28:47.061 --> 28:53.772
one reason, and I know there are several other 
reasons we weren't as successful as we could have

28:47.061 --> 28:53.772
been, We never really turned loose of everything. 
We always seemed to fight with one hand behind our

28:58.951 --> 29:01.834
backs.

29:06.539 --> 29:12.965
I think we're a little afraid that millions of the 
Chinese would come into the war. I think today

29:13.726 --> 29:19.692
sometimes people have lost sight of the situation 
back then. We were concerned about what the

29:20.482 --> 29:31.999
Russians

29:20.482 --> 29:31.999
and the Chinese would do if we went in with an 
all-out effort against the North Vietnamese.

29:32.019 --> 29:32.540
What would the Chinese do? Would they turn loose 
millions of Chinese troops to come down?

29:38.809 --> 29:44.678
Would we be involved in something that we had no 
intentions of getting into or getting involved

29:38.809 --> 29:44.678
with? How would we fight a major land war with 
millions of Chinese? We were a little bit afraid of

29:50.637 --> 29:52.020
that. How much effort would the Soviet Union 
provide? We didn't know. So we did fight a little

29:59.393 --> 30:12.257
bit restrained, not knowing what we might run up 
against, not wanting to alienate the Soviets too

29:59.393 --> 30:12.257
much. I think that hurt us in the long run. I think in 
hindsight we would have gone in there with a lot

30:15.876 --> 30:25.489
more force a lot sooner and probably ended that war 
on favorable terms for us. But I think we have to

30:26.551 --> 30:33.080
realize that conditions were a little different 
in those times. Contrast that again with Iraq. We

30:34.962 --> 30:38.267
didn't have to worry about the Chinese or the 
Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was essentially on

30:38.287 --> 30:41.451
our side and supporting the thing. So we could go in 
with a free hand and dump half a million troops into

30:41.903 --> 30:52.458
the Persian Gulf in a few months without fear about 
what the Soviet Union was going to do. That was not

30:52.478 --> 30:54.721
the case in Vietnam. We had to worry about some 
other things. And we didn't want to get into too big

30:58.186 --> 31:03.574
a war over there. So I think that caused us to be a 
little restrained. But again, in hindsight, had

31:06.178 --> 31:11.185
we marshalled the forces that we needed, early on 
and gone in without holding back, I think

31:11.452 --> 31:23.085
we could have ended that thing a lot sooner. What 
lessons did the U.S. Air Force learn from the

31:23.105 --> 31:27.330
Vietnam experience? Well, some we've already 
touched on.

31:32.335 --> 31:37.040
I'd say not only the Air Force, but all the military 
learned some lessons over there. I think joining

31:37.060 --> 31:41.205
this is one thing that we weren't very good at back 
in those days. services tended to do things by

31:41.506 --> 31:46.514
themselves. We didn't have the command structure 
set up as well as it could have been. I think, again,

31:53.185 --> 32:01.519
what we saw in the Persian Gulf is a good example of 
how jointness can work if you put certain

31:53.185 --> 32:01.519
commanders in charge. You know, Schwarzkopf was 
in charge of the whole operation that got minimum

32:06.920 --> 32:09.002
guidance from Washington. He had a pretty free 
hand in selecting targets and letting commanders

32:09.022 --> 32:14.669
do their thing. That was a lesson we learned in 
Vietnam. All the good things I saw in the Persian

32:16.932 --> 32:25.262
Gulf were pretty much lessons we'd learned in 
Vietnam and carried them through well. We didn't

32:25.282 --> 32:28.305
get in a war of attrition in the Persian Gulf. I was 
in the state we made in Vietnam. We just sort of

32:31.749 --> 32:36.775
counted the dead people every day to determine how 
well you're doing. And those numbers were totally

32:37.160 --> 32:43.445
erroneous, exaggerated. Sometimes it just 
didn't know and you can't know. That was a mistake,

32:46.088 --> 32:57.357
but something we learned to not get into a war of 
attrition, counting dead bodies.

32:57.377 --> 33:06.525
But putting air power under one commander, I 
think, was something we learned in Vietnam and

32:57.377 --> 33:06.525
something that was executed very well in the 
Persian Gulf. And one Air Force three-star

33:06.944 --> 33:14.974
general was in charge of all of the air forces, all 
elements of our power in the Persian Gulf. And I

33:14.994 --> 33:23.305
think that has set a precedent that we'll stick to 
for some time to come. But we had too many – we were

33:23.325 --> 33:30.454
just too fractured, I think, in Vietnam from a lot 
of standpoints. Other lessons, mobilization

33:31.480 --> 33:38.648
is one that I mentioned. To call up the forces you 
need and put them there for the period that you need

33:38.668 --> 33:45.696
them rather than getting into this rotation box. 
That hurt us terribly

33:45.716 --> 33:50.181
in Vietnam. Particularly in the services like the 
Army and the Marine Corps that didn't require a lot

33:55.460 --> 34:01.489
of foot soldiers on the ground, a lot of privates, 
if you would. And they were drafting these people

34:01.509 --> 34:05.916
and giving them a minimum amount of training, 
sending them over there. They didn't want to be

34:05.936 --> 34:11.023
there after a while.

34:11.043 --> 34:19.516
And, you know, all the horror stories of Vietnam 
evolved from that kind of thing. The fraggies and

34:19.536 --> 34:20.758
the drug, you know, culture almost started during 
that period. Just a lot of bad things, I think, from

34:29.142 --> 34:39.555
a rotation

34:29.142 --> 34:39.555
policy that called for a lot of grantees to be sent 
over there. We weren't really committed to the

34:39.575 --> 34:41.858
effort. I think we learned that we need more 
stability in units rather than just a flow of

34:41.878 --> 34:50.408
people going in and out of a unit. It's been studied 
and proven for years that people will die for a unit

34:50.911 --> 35:00.305
that they feel very attached to when they wouldn't 
for any other reason. They'll die for a friend or a

35:00.325 --> 35:03.590
buddy that's very close to them. But when you're 
rotating people in and out of a unit, there's no

35:03.610 --> 35:11.061
real attachment to each other. I think that was a 
good lesson

35:11.081 --> 35:16.969
from Vietnam. Working in unified ways Again, it 
relates to the jointness theory. I think it was a

35:24.375 --> 35:25.336
good lesson. We certainly improved there how to 
work together. Another thing we learned was that

35:30.502 --> 35:43.058
responsibility, well, those who execute the war 
have to be put down as low a level as you can do that.

35:44.033 --> 35:56.851
The field commanders have to be given some 
authority

35:44.033 --> 35:56.851
to do certain things. Everything cannot be 
controlled from back home. I know that you had many

36:00.316 --> 36:06.244
unforgettable experiences while in Vietnam, but 
is there any one in particular that you would like

36:00.316 --> 36:06.244
to relate to me?

36:12.637 --> 36:23.971
Well, I guess one of the,

36:12.637 --> 36:23.971
again, this happened in the spring of 1966, which 
was pretty early in the war. But flying B-52s there

36:23.991 --> 36:27.075
was still a pretty new thing. I remember we got a 
mission that we were told one day that the next day

36:28.376 --> 36:38.509
that we were going to North Vietnam to bomb, which

36:40.936 --> 36:52.868
presented a much more serious threat to us as a big 
airplane, something we were quite apprehensive

36:40.936 --> 36:52.868
about, as it turned out, and we actually were over 
in Laos. But it again was a much more hostile

36:54.350 --> 37:00.937
environment than what we had been flying earlier 
missions into. We were concerned about that, but

37:00.957 --> 37:06.943
they had this

37:00.957 --> 37:06.943
big the trail that the Vietnamese were using to 
transport equipment, supplies, and people down.

37:15.551 --> 37:18.915
But there was a big cliff area there, as I 
understood it, that was going to us. Down at the

37:20.776 --> 37:26.782
bottom was a valley that, again, a lot of the 
equipment was flowing down to south Vietnam. But

37:28.123 --> 37:37.251
they wanted to send the B-52s in there to sort of 
level that cliff, fill in the valley, and shut off

37:37.720 --> 37:44.609
with the supply of equipment and supplies into 
South Vietnam. And we took it as a big challenge,

37:44.629 --> 37:52.980
and it was the biggest mission flown up until that 
point of the war. And I remember we were tasked to

37:53.000 --> 38:04.656
fly 30 B-52s and 30 KC-135s, taking off at 
one-minute intervals, all launching from Guam

37:53.000 --> 38:04.656
during the night hours. something that we were 
very keyed up for. You know, I can liken it to one of

38:10.442 --> 38:14.387
the early missions of the troops. It was like the 
first night that they flew into Iraq. It's kind of

38:17.992 --> 38:23.520
unknown territory and you don't know what threats 
you're going to run into. We suspected that the

38:23.540 --> 38:34.155
fighters would be after us and some SAMs would be 
after us and that proved true to some extent. But

38:34.175 --> 38:34.896
again, We all took that mission very seriously 
with a great deal of apprehension of the unknown.

38:45.576 --> 38:56.226
But I remember we took off that night, and the most 
amazing thing to me was that we were scheduled to

38:45.576 --> 38:56.226
launch 60 airplanes at one-minute intervals. And 
I'm talking big airplanes. I'm not talking F-15s

38:56.887 --> 38:59.449
or something like that, little fighters. But to 
put together a 60 ship launch at one minute

39:02.281 --> 39:09.913
intervals is a pretty fantastic thing. But that 
night we, in total darkness, launched those 60

39:09.933 --> 39:20.811
airplanes exactly on the hack when they depart. 
That may not seem such a tremendous thing to one

39:21.391 --> 39:29.925
that's not that familiar with aviation big 
airplanes, nighttime, carrying large loads of

39:31.238 --> 39:37.507
bombs. But I considered it the greatest thing that 
I observed. Again, all 60 of those airplanes took

39:42.354 --> 39:48.382
off, performed their mission, and all returned. 
We did have some SAMs, and I remember listening

39:48.402 --> 39:56.193
over the radio that night. I remember a couple of 
fighter planes were shot down by SAMs, and I heard

39:56.213 --> 40:01.060
and saw some of that. But again, all of the weapons 
were delivered and every airplane flew its

40:03.200 --> 40:14.783
mission as prescribed and all returned as 
planned. And I think that's a pretty amazing feat

40:14.803 --> 40:16.566
in aviation. Unfortunately, we dropped the bombs 
and thought we'd done a pretty good job. But we were

40:22.910 --> 40:34.125
told within just a few days that they would reopen 
up the supply lines through that same valley that

40:22.910 --> 40:34.125
we thought we would wipe down. So while it was a 
great feat, it was a great disappointment too

40:34.145 --> 40:46.302
because we didn't really do what, although we 
cratered the cliff and filled in the valley and all

40:34.145 --> 40:46.302
of that, The

40:47.513 --> 40:58.987
photo by recce planes in the next few days showed 
that they had thousands of Vietnamese in there

40:47.513 --> 40:58.987
working and had it all open again in a few days. So no 
great feat, but really a disappointing kind of

40:59.007 --> 41:11.482
thing, but also showed the number of problems that 
we faced with that terrain for those people. Thank

41:11.502 --> 41:12.103
you very much.
