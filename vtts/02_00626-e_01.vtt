WEBVTT

00:03.878 --> 00:07.884
So each time we turn the tape over, then we have that 
15-second protective delay.

00:11.729 --> 00:15.214
Now, first, Professor Fleming, I'd like to know 
what interested you in the sea. Why did you choose

00:15.334 --> 00:17.838
the sea as a profession? Well, I was studying as a 
chemist at the University of British Columbia and

00:19.400 --> 00:33.801
completed my bachelor's degree in 1929 and stayed 
on at the at the University of British Columbia,

00:34.743 --> 00:39.187
take a master's degree in chemistry. And this, as 
you should recognize, was the beginning of the

00:40.008 --> 00:46.354
Depression. And it was quite obvious to me that 
there were more chemists than were going to be

00:46.394 --> 01:03.771
needed, and that it was particularly difficult to 
obtain any sort of graduate student support in

00:46.394 --> 01:03.771
chemistry. And I had become somewhat bored with 
the field of chemistry and thought I'd better seek

01:04.308 --> 01:12.779
some other area. And I'd grown up right by the 
water. Many of my friends were essentially marine

01:16.864 --> 01:20.809
biologists. I happened to hear about this field 
called oceanography, and it seemed very

01:21.711 --> 01:26.457
intriguing. So I was able to obtain a research 
assistantship at Scripps Institution.

01:33.518 --> 01:35.601
California in 1931 down there. Had

01:36.843 --> 01:42.151
you not been to Scripps before you acquired it? No. 
In those days one didn't travel very much. It was a

01:48.301 --> 01:51.365
major expedition to get to Southern California. 
Actually, I went down by ship.

01:57.555 --> 02:02.142
Did you know with whom you wished to work at Scripps 
when you went? Really, I expected to work in

02:02.847 --> 02:31.386
chemistry, and at that time the chemist at Scripps 
was Eric Moberg, and I did essentially work with

02:02.847 --> 02:31.386
him for a number of years, although I moved out of 
the field of chemical oceanography after a few

02:02.847 --> 02:31.386
years and became involved in sort of descriptive 
physical oceanography. How long were you at

02:32.227 --> 02:33.989
Scripps? Well, I was there as a graduate student 
for four years. And I completed my PhD in 1935 and

02:40.655 --> 02:54.107
then was kept on in a sort of research capacity for 
one year just as an assistant. And then in 1936, I

02:54.167 --> 03:00.613
was appointed as an instructor faculty at 
Scripps, and this was at the time that Harold

03:01.167 --> 03:12.863
Fairgroup had just been appointed and came in as 
the director, which he did in September of 1936.

03:14.365 --> 03:19.071
When did you first acquire the idea of the textbook 
that became the standard in the field? Well, this

03:19.091 --> 03:29.065
came more or less by accident, as a lot of these 
things do, that Scripps had never had any

03:19.091 --> 03:29.065
particular program and sort of education and when 
Harold Spadro came as the director he felt that we

03:29.382 --> 03:58.798
ought to be doing more in this line and he started 
some summer courses in oceanography sort of a

03:29.382 --> 03:58.798
general survey course and he and Martin Johnson 
and I were the sort of principal lecturers and The

03:59.588 --> 04:11.227
Prentice Hall Publishing Company apparently 
heard about this through their grapevine and came

03:59.588 --> 04:11.227
down and suggested that we write down our lecture 
notes. And being all innocent, we said yes, we

04:11.668 --> 04:16.236
would be willing to do so. And it was out of this 
summer course in oceanography that that the

04:23.281 --> 04:27.067
volume on the oceans finally appeared. It took us 
about three years to write it, and it was finished

04:27.828 --> 04:33.035
in 1942. What sort of work were you doing at Scripps 
while you were there? Oh, I went down and, do you

04:36.921 --> 04:41.388
mean as a graduate student? As a graduate student 
and then old as a... I was sort of a jack of all trades

04:43.972 --> 04:50.421
and have been, I think, all my career. But My 
principal interest was originally in some sort of

04:51.833 --> 05:17.402
chemical work, and I did some work on the calcium 
carbonate problem, something on nutrients, and

04:51.833 --> 05:17.402
used to

04:51.833 --> 05:17.402
participate in the very limited sort of seagoing 
program we had in those days. And then in 1932, I was

05:23.249 --> 05:43.558
given a leave, in a sense, and went up to Berkeley, 
to the University of California, to get a little

05:23.249 --> 05:43.558
bit more coursework and to prepare for my general 
examinations and when I came back to Scripps from

05:44.078 --> 06:12.702
there and early in 1933

05:44.078 --> 06:12.702
I was told that the Navy wanted somebody to go down 
to Central America to carry out some

05:44.078 --> 06:12.702
oceanographic work on board one of the naval 
vessels and so I went down and joined the USS

05:44.078 --> 06:12.702
Hannibal which was a vessel used by the then Navy 
Hydrographic Office and spent several months

06:13.407 --> 06:31.330
down off the west coast of Panama and Costa Rica 
doing just sort of the field routine which had

06:13.407 --> 06:31.330
already been sort of planned. And when I got back to 
La Jolla, the said, well, why don't you write up the

06:37.707 --> 06:40.832
results? And so this actually turned out to be my 
doctoral thesis and got me into sort of

06:41.092 --> 06:49.525
descriptive physical oceanography. That was 
what I was interested in, is when did you get this

06:49.545 --> 06:54.713
first descriptive oceanography that you were in 
in the early 30s? And you stayed with that, though,

06:55.654 --> 06:57.517
for two or three years. I think of you more there 
than as a chemical oceanographer. Oh, yes. I

07:01.323 --> 07:04.828
haven't really done any chemical oceanography. 
since that time, really, because as

07:05.264 --> 07:33.094
soon as I had finished up my thesis on this 
particular material, why, Dr. Sverdrup had

07:05.264 --> 07:33.094
arrived and

07:05.264 --> 07:33.094
was very anxious to start a more kind of systematic 
program of field work. And this developed in a sort

07:34.829 --> 08:03.722
of indirect way, as many of these enterprises did, 
in that the California Fish and Game Commission

07:34.829 --> 08:03.722
was, at that time, concerned with the problem of 
the distribution and abundance of California

07:34.829 --> 08:03.722
sardines and wanted to do some oceanographic 
work. made available to Scripps the use of a small

08:04.664 --> 08:14.217
patrol vessel called the Bluefin. And in the early 
spring, and I think it extended up into the summer

08:14.998 --> 08:32.241
of 1937, we got our first sort of systematic series 
of observations off the Southern California

08:14.998 --> 08:32.241
coast. This continued and so on, so we became very 
much involved in essentially the regional

08:33.115 --> 08:42.927
oceanography off the coast of California. Who 
worked in the sardine fisheries activities with

08:43.448 --> 08:46.892
you? Well, we just did

08:47.293 --> 09:01.350
a certain amount of work on conventional physical 
oceanography.

09:01.837 --> 09:31.692
a little bit of chemistry and some work on the 
plankton they we never became at that time

09:01.837 --> 09:31.692
directly involved in any of the fish studies but 
the the federal government had also become very

09:01.837 --> 09:31.692
much involved in the problem and the two people 
that we dealt with a good deal were alton b seti and

09:01.837 --> 09:31.692
lana walford both of what was then i think the 
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, although they

09:31.891 --> 09:35.969
changed their names often. I'm not quite sure of 
this one. But they were very much involved in the

09:40.649 --> 09:46.038
fisheries aspect, and also the state fisheries. 
And the man in the state fisheries with whom we

09:46.118 --> 09:57.839
worked very closely is now at USC, is Richard B. 
Tibby, you may have run across. And he came down

09:59.261 --> 10:03.889
after a year or two and actually finished his Ph.D. 
at Scripps on the oceanography of the California

10:04.156 --> 10:12.143
coast. Now, this is really the first time the 
Pacific coast is being mapped, is when you're

10:12.163 --> 10:19.710
mapping it now in these several years. Were you 
surprised about certain things? Well, I think

10:23.614 --> 10:26.116
it's yes and no.

10:32.402 --> 10:33.623
Because of the interest in the sardine problem, 
the region was more or less prescribed for us, and

10:34.514 --> 10:55.796
yet within that area, which extended off the 
coast, I imagine about a couple hundred miles,

10:34.514 --> 10:55.796
they wanted considerable detail. So I think one of 
the things that was rather original was the fact

11:00.687 --> 11:10.223
that we made repeated studies on a fairly closely 
spaced network of stations. And this showed

11:11.044 --> 11:17.394
details that were essentially unanticipated, 
certainly. And also, Professor Sverdrup, in

11:17.775 --> 11:27.471
particular, became very interested in the role of 
upwelling as it affected waters to the south of

11:28.177 --> 11:30.680
Point Conception. And I think we had some of the 
first sort of evidence on the existence of eddies

11:32.362 --> 11:44.056
in the area that these sort of features had not been 
identified before.

11:47.820 --> 11:50.704
Who was joining you in Scripps between, let's say, 
35 on? You seem to have a whole series of people come

11:51.725 --> 11:57.812
in at Scripps about this time who go on.

11:59.007 --> 12:24.846
The biggest changes occurred, I feel, in about 
1931,

11:59.007 --> 12:24.846
which was just about the time I went there as a 
graduate student, and that Dr. Vaughan, who was

11:59.007 --> 12:24.846
the director, had been able to get some additional 
funds, and he had a really a very imaginative sort

12:25.383 --> 12:32.351
of view of what ought to be done at that time. And he 
added two faculty people, Claude Zobel in

12:32.972 --> 12:46.948
microbiology and Dennis Fox essentially in 
physiology and biochemistry. And this

12:48.049 --> 12:54.917
represented a major kind of shift in what was going 
on at Scripps in the The physical area and the field

12:55.673 --> 13:23.942
work, there were no sort of major additions to the

12:55.673 --> 13:23.942
faculty and staff, except during these years we 
had considerable support from people who were

12:55.673 --> 13:23.942
provided to the institution under the WPA, the 
Works Progress Administration. One of the

13:25.137 --> 13:41.242
curious things is that the illustrations in my 
thesis were all drawn by a man whose background had

13:25.137 --> 13:41.242
been in architecture and was being supported on 
these federal funds. And all my graphs looked like

13:41.964 --> 13:47.673
architectural drawings. But we had considerable 
staff support, technician support in those days.

13:53.605 --> 13:57.531
people who were assigned to Scripps under the WPA 
program. Gene LaFond was one person who worked

13:59.935 --> 14:10.732
very closely with this program, with Svirgrup and 
I, and that was about it. Things weren't quite as

14:11.934 --> 14:14.958
large as they are today. Did you find much exchange 
among the faculty in that time? In other words,

14:17.943 --> 14:20.507
were you able to come to Let's say people like 
Martin Johnson and talk about your problems, many

14:21.078 --> 14:25.522
meetings, this sort of thing? Not particularly. 
As far as the kind of research work was concerned,

14:28.565 --> 14:39.336
everybody did their own particular job. But as I 
mentioned a few minutes ago, we did collect

14:39.496 --> 14:48.705
plankton samples on these cruises. The 
phytoplankton were examined by Mr. Allen and his

14:49.225 --> 15:09.466
associate, Easter Cupp, and Martin Johnson and 
his assistants and students did the work on the

14:49.225 --> 15:09.466
zooplankton. So yes, and the group was small 
enough that you did sort of see everybody

15:15.331 --> 15:20.379
frequently and there was a good deal of exchange, 
yes. But it was not a, it didn't by any means sort of

15:20.399 --> 15:32.117
involve all of the activities at Scripps or all the 
faculty.

15:32.137 --> 15:33.859
When does Roger Revell get to Scripps? Well, he 
arrived a month or two after I did in the summer of

15:33.960 --> 15:43.414
1931 and came down to work on the sediment samples 
that had been collected on the cruise of the

15:43.765 --> 16:11.815
non-magnetic vessel Carnegie during, I think it 
was 1928-29,

15:43.765 --> 16:11.815
and he was to carry out this examination

15:43.765 --> 16:11.815
of the material under the direction of Dr. Vaughn, 
but He also got interested in a number of things.

16:14.881 --> 16:30.516
And we worked together on several problems, one of 
them concerning the solubility of calcium

16:14.881 --> 16:30.516
carbonate and the precipitation of calcium 
carbonate in seawater.

16:31.597 --> 16:41.667
And he also used to participate in some of these 
cruises that we made before the sardine

16:31.597 --> 16:41.667
investigation began in 1937. In fact, he and I used 
to take the research vessel out most of the time

16:42.921 --> 16:53.553
when I acted as captain on deckhands. We had only a 
one-man crew who was the engineer on the small

16:53.933 --> 17:02.623
vessel that was available. It's been suggested to 
me recently that one of the problems with the

17:02.643 --> 17:08.009
modern oceanographers, they don't get their feet 
wet, so to speak. They don't spend enough time on

17:08.029 --> 17:09.531
vessels. Would you agree with that? Yes and no. I 
think the

17:12.924 --> 17:37.388
character of the work at sea has changed as the 
vessels have become much larger and as the

17:12.924 --> 17:37.388
equipment has become much more complex, and that 
the vessel we had the times I'm talking about prior

17:37.722 --> 18:03.915
to the sardine surveys was just called the scripts 
and she was a 55 foot trawler type vessel with a one

17:37.722 --> 18:03.915
man permanent crew and so the graduate students in 
general used to take out and run the ship

17:37.722 --> 18:03.915
essentially and navigate as necessary do all of 
the sampling do all of the sort of deckhand

18:04.722 --> 18:13.895
functions, as well as work on the samples after 
they were back in the laboratory. Now it's more

18:14.556 --> 18:27.596
like, I have the feeling as a graduate student goes 
out, it's more or less like going on an ocean liner,

18:14.556 --> 18:27.596
that they're just in a sense kind of a passenger on a 
big, relatively large vessel. They have very

18:27.656 --> 18:31.962
little to do with the planning or with the 
navigation, the operation of the vessels at sea,

18:32.262 --> 18:44.321
and usually don't know very much about what's 
going on except the specific sort of project

18:32.262 --> 18:44.321
they're engaged in. So I think we've lost 
something in this process. And there's

18:49.510 --> 18:57.342
still some, I think, activities of the type that 
I'm reminiscing about that are conducted in some

18:57.642 --> 19:07.136
nearshore work in various institutions. But 
still, I find the students have a very sort of

19:07.156 --> 19:13.986
narrow concept of what goes on. There we go. About 
15 seconds here. What do you mean? It pauses now?

19:21.897 --> 19:25.202
Yeah, I've got a 15-second delay to make sure we 
don't overtake.

19:31.055 --> 19:44.869
Now, it's also been suggested that with the advent 
of the computer in terms of collecting data and

19:31.055 --> 19:44.869
evaluating it and so forth, particularly 
concerning physical oceanography, that the

19:31.055 --> 19:44.869
physical oceanographer loses touch with what 
he's doing. Would you agree with that? Well, I

19:46.510 --> 20:00.184
certainly would, and that's one of the things that 
has bothered me a good deal in recent years is the

19:46.510 --> 20:00.184
capability to take more data and to use a computer 
for various processing, routine processing,

20:00.569 --> 20:28.644
compilation, manipulation, compilation 
analysis, plotting, and so on, that the younger

20:00.569 --> 20:28.644
scientists don't have the kind of familiarity 
with the specific information that I think we had

20:00.569 --> 20:28.644
in years gone by. I think I can say, with some 
confidence that I used to know every observation

20:30.640 --> 20:40.391
that had ever been made in most of the Pacific 
Ocean. And there weren't very many, but I knew

20:40.412 --> 20:49.102
every one and could evaluate

20:40.412 --> 20:49.102
it. I knew whether it was good or bad. I knew how it 
was related to other observations and so on. And

20:54.748 --> 20:58.673
this kind of an intimacy is certainly being lost 
today, where Students may not even see the set of

20:59.075 --> 21:05.607
original data in any form. Times have changed, and 
I'm harking back to a condition that will probably

21:05.927 --> 21:15.445
never prevail again. But I think something has 
been lost here.

21:22.938 --> 21:23.479
Now, when When you began to plan your voyages, 
let's say around 37 or 38, I'm interested in how you

21:23.797 --> 21:30.846
made your decisions, where to go, what to do. Was it 
pretty well dictated by the fisheries itself, or

21:31.227 --> 21:36.754
were you pretty free to do what you wanted to do? No, 
I would say that we were fairly free. I'm

21:41.520 --> 21:53.736
talking only in terms of really one more or less 
specific evaporation, but within a rather

21:54.458 --> 22:06.530
general frame of reference, why we were allowed to 
plan our own program. And, of course, it was

22:06.651 --> 22:13.317
discussed with Alton Setty and Lionel Alford and 
others that were involved. But in general, I think

22:14.018 --> 22:23.588
we decided what should be done and how it should be 
done, where, when, and so on.

22:24.833 --> 22:32.226
There was a considerable freedom in choice here in 
what we did. The other thing we were able to do at

22:32.266 --> 22:42.583
that time was to work out fairly sort of 
comprehensive programs as far as types of

22:32.266 --> 22:42.583
information gathered. There's certainly a case 
always of trying to optimize what we could do

22:48.121 --> 23:00.502
because we had very limited resources in terms of 
money and people and equipment, so we had to select

22:48.121 --> 23:00.502
fairly carefully what we felt we could do. I have to 
remember that most of this was even before the days

23:01.303 --> 23:08.115
of the whole mechanical bathy thermograph, the 
BT. In fact, we had the experience of working with I

23:13.028 --> 23:35.419
think it was BT number 5, which was sent to us in the 
spring of 1941 by Woods Hole, when nobody even knew

23:13.028 --> 23:35.419
whether the instrument would function properly 
and had no kind of experience with the kind of

23:13.028 --> 23:35.419
information you could get with a device of that 
kind.

23:35.439 --> 23:39.304
When you were at Scripps in this period, was there 
much contact with international oceanography?

23:39.885 --> 23:42.208
Did you have any international oceanographers 
come through? Yes, we used to have quite a few

23:42.408 --> 24:07.707
visitors, at least relatively speaking, in that 
Professor Vaughn, who was the director from,

23:42.408 --> 24:07.707
actually I think it was from 1924 until 1936,

23:42.408 --> 24:07.707
had been relatively active in sort of 
international ocean activities. matters and had

24:08.328 --> 24:22.508
a number of friends and professional friends in 
foreign countries, Japan, Europe, and so on. And

24:22.708 --> 24:30.239
we were one of the relatively few places that 
anyone interested in the ocean would come to visit

24:22.708 --> 24:30.239
in the United States. What I'm trying to say is 
there weren't very many places to visit. So we saw a

24:33.884 --> 24:36.968
good many of the of the distinguished people from 
other areas. And then when Professor Sverdrup

24:42.391 --> 24:54.949
came in, he had a very close bond with many, many 
people in different fields and different

24:42.391 --> 24:54.949
countries, and this sort of continued in a way. And 
I can remember, in particular, we had one or more

24:56.211 --> 25:06.465
visits from Helen Hansen, a Norwegian 
oceanographer, and so we had reasonably good, I

25:07.407 --> 25:18.282
feel, in some ways, maybe better contacts than we 
have today. Now, when you were involved in this in

25:19.243 --> 25:25.792
the 30s, was there sort of a sense of excitement 
about moving out towards a new frontier? No, I

25:26.814 --> 25:28.476
don't think so. It was all good fun, but we didn't 
see any great manifest destiny or anything like

25:28.496 --> 25:35.946
that. We didn't think in terms of national ocean 
policy and so on. We just thought there were

25:41.420 --> 25:44.925
interesting scientific problems to be solved. 
And as I look back on it now, that period really

25:45.786 --> 26:04.752
before the war at Scripps, we were very much in sort 
of ivory tower, although as I've already

25:45.786 --> 26:04.752
indicated, we were beginning to move into what 
might be called applied oceanography as it was

25:45.786 --> 26:04.752
related to some of these fisheries projects. But 
ordinarily, though, this is still primarily

26:05.660 --> 26:12.407
research for its own sake rather than sort of the 
applied research that comes out between 41 and 45?

26:12.527 --> 26:15.890
Oh,

26:12.527 --> 26:15.890
yes. The funding of the institution at that time, 
the Scripps Institution, was basically all

26:16.551 --> 26:34.789
through the University of California, since the 
state funds reaching us through the university.

26:35.056 --> 26:56.256
except that in connection with the sardine 
investigations, the Federal

26:35.056 --> 26:56.256
Fisheries Agency did provide money to help 
operate the vessel, which was the E.W. Scripps at

26:56.416 --> 26:58.818
that time. This is after the bluefin were getting 
in. We got a number of omissions and so on in trying

27:04.199 --> 27:09.744
to trace the history of these things. But we

27:10.465 --> 27:21.536
did not consider, as one would probably do now, 
that we were dependent on federal funding to

27:10.465 --> 27:21.536
function. We were essentially supported through 
the academic funds from the University of

27:21.656 --> 27:31.405
California.

27:31.840 --> 27:39.567
There was also support from some of the members of 
the Scripps family, which was available at that

27:31.840 --> 27:39.567
time. There has also been discussion that perhaps 
the nature of oceanography has changed for the

27:39.607 --> 27:49.836
worse, and that they have lost sort of the 
jack-of-all-trades approach. Would you agree

27:49.876 --> 27:50.657
with that? Well, this is, I think, where personal 
prejudice has come in, and I would agree that I feel

27:51.177 --> 27:59.805
that... One of the things that attracted me to the 
field originally was the fact that we were able to

28:00.292 --> 28:28.324
deal with what I consider is essentially a unified 
system, and where we could cross the disciplinary

28:00.292 --> 28:28.324
boundaries, which we did very freely at that time, 
between chemistry, physical aspects, biology,

28:00.292 --> 28:28.324
geology, without anybody raising an eyebrow. And 
we did try and deal with the systems as well as we

28:30.532 --> 28:39.363
could, as essentially unified systems. And I 
think today it's become fragmented again by

28:39.383 --> 28:58.446
specialization, which is partly, I think, the 
result of the interests of the scientists who come

28:39.383 --> 28:58.446
into the field, but it's also being encouraged, in 
a sense, by the way in which the federal funding has

28:59.033 --> 29:09.105
become more and more specialized and fragmented. 
And I don't consider this desirable at all. Most of

29:15.533 --> 29:22.982
my efforts in recent years have been to try and 
bring the subject matter back together again as

29:15.533 --> 29:22.982
much as I can.
