00:01.297 --> 00:02.338
Tell me your full name. Tell me when you were born, 
where you were born,

00:02.418 --> 00:12.747
what you did as a young man, what you were 
interested in. Tell me a little bit about your

00:12.787 --> 00:18.272
folks, what kind of influence they had on you, 
stuff like that. Today is the 31st of July, 1997.

00:22.175 --> 00:25.378
We're in San Antonio, Texas. Good. So if you could 
just begin. With that, I appreciate it. I'll

00:32.507 --> 00:36.913
interrupt you from time to time with questions or 
clarifications. My name is Frank Adair Camp.

00:40.678 --> 00:41.439
Would you spell Adair? Adair is A-D-A-I-R,

00:41.659 --> 00:47.527
which was my mother's maiden name. I was born 
December the 21st of 1920 in a very small town up in

00:48.649 --> 00:59.063
north central Texas named Blum, B-L-U-M. My 
mother and father were ranchers right at the edge

01:00.022 --> 01:07.012
of town up on High Rocky Hill. What's Blum near? 
Blum is near the county seat of, it's in Hill County

01:08.934 --> 01:15.303
and the county seat is Hillsboro. It's closer to 
Cleburne actually than it is to Hillsboro. And a

01:19.248 --> 01:25.737
lot of people now can locate it because it's also on 
the edge of Lake Whitney. Uh-huh. And so people

01:26.887 --> 01:31.813
come there from Dallas and Fort Worth for fishing. 
My mother died when I was four years old. Suddenly,

01:38.400 --> 01:50.414
she'd had mastoiditis and she got pneumonia and 
died on December 24th, buried on Christmas Day. My

01:52.316 --> 01:55.780
father never remarried.

01:57.734 --> 02:06.408
He had one old mate's sister who came a couple of 
times in my growing up and lived with us. And other

02:07.289 --> 02:09.532
cousins came. The purpose of her coming primarily 
was because she lived out in the country where

02:09.552 --> 02:17.865
there was only a country school. And these other 
two cousins had gone as far as they could go there

02:17.926 --> 02:24.636
and they needed to come into town. and have a better 
school so she came to live with us. But in the summer

02:28.993 --> 02:33.541
times I was living with grandparents mostly. 
Where did your grandparents live? They lived in

02:35.824 --> 02:40.051
the same area of Blum out in the country there. My 
father's folks actually lived in a sandy land area

02:40.812 --> 02:50.488
there near Blanton really. which was another just 
a wide place in the road. My mother's people had a

02:55.568 --> 03:07.401
ranch right on the upper edges of the river that 
later became Lake Whitney.

03:10.084 --> 03:20.796
Unfortunately, when my mother died, I went to live 
with her parents, and in April after my mother

03:10.084 --> 03:20.796
died, my grandmother died. So, my mother had one 
brother who had been in the Navy in World War I. He

03:35.279 --> 03:43.786
came home at the end of the war and decided to help 
his father with the ranch there. He never married,

03:44.547 --> 03:51.053
but I was always relatively close to him. and his 
father, and they lived out there on the ranch by

03:51.809 --> 03:56.115
themselves. And I spent some time with them in the 
summer times.

04:03.947 --> 04:05.449
Blum is a very small town. There was only about 200 
people in the town. There were as many people in the

04:09.835 --> 04:21.192
school as there was in the town because it had a bus 
system that drew from around that whole area

04:09.835 --> 04:21.192
there. although my graduating class from high 
school had a total of 14 of them, seven boys and

04:22.049 --> 04:29.417
seven girls. And people have asked me sometimes, 
how come that you went to A&M? Well, at that time,

04:37.905 --> 04:44.172
this was back, I graduated in 1938, right in the 
heart of the Depression. People had very little

04:46.274 --> 04:48.996
money, very few people went to college. I had a 
small, inheritance from my mother that I used and

04:52.222 --> 05:19.123
why I chose A&M I really don't know except that I 
remember one time when I was about a sophomore or

04:52.222 --> 05:19.123
junior in high school that there was some evening 
occasion going on and there was a visit at this

04:52.222 --> 05:19.123
party so to speak of some seniors from A&M. And I was 
just intrigued by them. So I wrote and got a catalog

05:26.161 --> 05:32.210
and decided that's where I'd like to go. The thing 
that made it most inviting was that you could go

05:32.230 --> 05:40.522
there so cheaply because you were wearing 
uniforms which were partly furnished. The most

05:42.686 --> 05:48.975
that I paid, for example, for a room and board my 
freshman year was $27 a month. The amount that they

05:52.703 --> 05:59.714
charged the board was based on their actual dining 
hall expenses the month before. And so I could

06:00.856 --> 06:08.668
attend there and

06:00.856 --> 06:08.668
not have to too much expense. So did you enter A&M in 
38? I entered A&M in 38. So you were a class of 42. 42.

06:17.528 --> 06:24.575
And of course in December 41 was when the Pearl 
Harbor plane came. I went home at Christmas time

06:24.615 --> 06:29.920
and In 41? In 41 and went to see my draft board. 
Because A&M at that time had a requirement that you

06:37.606 --> 07:05.065
had to stay at school my memory says April 15th it 
may have been May 1st if you were there that long

06:37.606 --> 07:05.065
they would give you your degree and so I went to the 
draft board and asked them if I would be able to stay

06:37.606 --> 07:05.065
there and they laughed at me and said you're crazy 
you're number 8 in the county and you'll be gone the

06:37.606 --> 07:05.065
first month and so I believed them Actually, I 
didn't get drafted until the first week of July, as

07:06.310 --> 07:16.248
it turned out. So you didn't go back to school then? 
You stayed at home? I stayed at school, but I didn't

07:18.832 --> 07:22.880
register for the second semester. Oh. But the 
government was paying for some special courses on

07:24.822 --> 07:29.750
campus. And so even though I didn't want to lose my 
money, I didn't mind letting the government pay

07:30.411 --> 07:37.923
for something for me. And I could stay on campus 
with my friends and this sort of thing until I got

07:39.305 --> 07:44.393
called. So July of 41, you got drafted? July of 41. 
No, 42. 42, I got drafted. That's right. And I was

07:52.385 --> 07:53.347
working. One of the courses that I took at this A&M 
thing was a course called Testing and Inspection

07:54.268 --> 08:00.397
of Engineering Materials. They still teach that. 
Of which I had absolutely no background for. I know

08:06.206 --> 08:10.032
nothing, just a friend who approved me so I could 
get in it. But anyway, when I got through it, an

08:10.553 --> 08:16.902
Aggie who had a big construction company up in 
Dallas was hiring all of us to help build army

08:17.168 --> 08:22.354
camps. So I went from A&M, when I finished that 
course, up to Gainesville, north of Fort Worth and

08:23.275 --> 08:36.169
Dallas, up there near the Oklahoma border, and 
helped them build an army camp. And on the weekend

08:36.289 --> 08:42.216
of 4th of July, I came home and found my draft notice 
there. And so I went in the next morning to Dallas

08:46.784 --> 08:57.259
and went to the Naval recruiting office and they 
asked me, what do you want to do in the Navy? I said, I

08:58.721 --> 09:00.344
just want in the Navy. Now, why did you choose the 
Navy? Was that because of this uncle? This uncle of

09:04.410 --> 09:05.371
yours? This uncle of mine, he had a very 
interesting experience during World War I, loved

09:05.391 --> 09:13.703
the Navy and So I had listened to him in my 
childhood, and just decided that's what I wanted

09:14.206 --> 09:18.131
to do. I didn't want to go in the Army, because I'd 
heard all kinds of tales about Army life, too. So I

09:23.397 --> 09:28.883
went into the recruiting office, told them I 
wanted to join the Navy, and they wanted to know

09:23.397 --> 09:28.883
what I wanted to do. And I said, I just want to join 
the Navy. But they noticed that I was working on a

09:31.226 --> 09:35.791
construction camp, so they said, we'll put you in 
the Seabees. That's construction battalions.

09:39.115 --> 09:42.559
Well, actually, I knew nothing about 
construction.

09:45.138 --> 09:48.982
But anyway, I was sent. That never stopped the 
military. No, it never stopped them. I rode from

09:53.066 --> 10:02.816
Dallas

09:53.066 --> 10:02.816
to Norfolk, Virginia on a train, open air. When I 
say that, all the windows were open. We all looked

10:05.018 --> 10:10.163
like black people when we got there because of the 
smoke. The soot. The soot coming in. Got in on a

10:12.725 --> 10:14.267
Wednesday. checked in to the base, and they very 
quickly made assignments for the rest of the week.

10:25.502 --> 10:37.800
And I got assigned to the gate duty on Sunday, which 
I was not very happy about, because that was the one

10:25.502 --> 10:37.800
day we had a little off and a little freedom. 
Actually, it turned out to be very lucky in that

10:37.820 --> 10:45.351
during the morning, the officer that was in charge 
detail, asked if anyone could type. Well, I was the

10:48.727 --> 10:50.410
only one that could. Those other construction 
people, they could hardly do anything besides

10:51.231 --> 10:57.580
doing their job. Anyway, after I helped him with 
his reports and everything, later on in the day, he

10:58.441 --> 11:10.900
said, Camp, I just got a notice down that they want 
people to come up in the morning me to send some

11:11.555 --> 11:21.567
people up to strike for yeoman and he said I don't 
know anything about a yeoman except I know he types

11:11.555 --> 11:21.567
and said you can type, you're heading my detail to 
go up there. So I went up there and was interviewed

11:22.388 --> 11:30.618
by a

11:22.388 --> 11:30.618
petty officer, chief petty officer. He kept 
asking me questions and finally he said you're

11:37.289 --> 11:40.513
really overqualified for the job that I had. He 
said, I just was looking for somebody to kind of be a

11:41.073 --> 11:46.760
messenger for the time being. And he said, I'm 
going to send you over for another interview. So he

11:49.283 --> 11:52.427
sent me over to another building. And I ended up 
being interviewed by the executive officer of the

11:52.527 --> 11:57.713
base. And he talked to me for a little while. And he 
said, where are you now? And I said, well, I'm in

12:02.258 --> 12:03.720
boot camp. And he said, well, as of in the morning, 
you're in my office. So he said, You didn't have to

12:07.529 --> 12:09.731
go to boot? I did not go to boot. I can't believe 
this. That's what people do. And I went to work for

12:15.037 --> 12:23.246
him, and we had a very good relationship. One day he 
called me, and he said, Why haven't you applied for

12:23.466 --> 12:27.691
midshipman school? I said, You've got all the 
qualifications for officer training. And I said,

12:31.915 --> 12:34.398
Well, I just haven't. I said, I'm happy with doing 
what I'm doing. I'm doing my job. He said, nah. He

12:39.308 --> 12:42.611
said, I want your application on my desk this week. 
So I went over, got my physical, and turned it in to

12:44.053 --> 12:47.016
him. And thinking, because I'd been actually 
helping with those applications, it takes about

12:47.116 --> 12:56.085
six months before anything happens. So I thought, 
by that time, I'll probably be ready for a change.

12:58.687 --> 13:00.629
So he took it to Washington. I had orders for the 
month it was over. And I went to Ben Shipman School

13:02.351 --> 13:08.097
in Chicago. Oh, the Naval Station. No. Downtown 
Chicago at the medical school, which they had

13:12.554 --> 13:20.567
taken over part of those buildings. And it was 
right next to a big armory. It would have been an

13:25.294 --> 13:28.579
army. Or were they trained there for, I guess, like 
the guard or something like that. They had that,

13:37.608 --> 13:46.517
and they took over where I lived, had been a woman's 
athletic club, high-rise athletic club. And then

13:47.878 --> 13:53.524
they had the dormitories also that medical 
students had lived in. So they took over that

13:54.565 --> 13:55.966
facility. Well, the nice thing about it was that we 
were the only officer-type military in the

13:56.026 --> 14:06.096
downtown Chicago area. So when I checked in on 
Sunday, when I arrived there, after I'd completed

14:06.734 --> 14:23.543
all their forms and got my room assignment and all 
this, they said, there's a lady out at the table on

14:06.734 --> 14:23.543
the veranda out there that would like to talk to you 
right there. Well, this was the social director of

14:23.563 --> 14:28.371
the Chicago Yacht Club. And she was inviting all of 
us, the incoming class, to come to a tea that

14:29.178 --> 14:36.366
afternoon to meet her girls. She had all these 
debutantes that were parents who were members of

14:37.548 --> 14:43.194
the Chicago Yacht Club there. And in order to have 
nice escorts for them, she depended on the

14:43.975 --> 14:53.566
midshipman school people. So we did that. We all 
met. nice young ladies who were looking for a good

14:59.502 --> 15:15.445
time and whose father had plenty of money to help us 
have a good time and on Saturday morning we had a

14:59.502 --> 15:15.445
review and when that was over we were free for the 
weekend. The girl that I got to know whose father

15:17.488 --> 15:26.961
was a professor out at Northwestern furnished me a 
car, furnished me money, to entertain his

15:27.245 --> 15:29.627
daughter. So the war was a trial. The war was a 
trial. It really was. I graduated from there at

15:36.474 --> 15:39.216
Christmas time. This was in 42 then? No, this was in 
43, I believe. So you were there... I went there...

15:47.704 --> 15:55.772
Actually, it took a little bit longer for me before 
I left for going there. I was... I was a yeoman first

15:57.586 --> 16:03.412
in Norfolk, and then after a few months they moved 
us up to Williamsburg, Virginia. And I was up there

16:03.452 --> 16:07.917
for several months before I actually went in. I'd 
been there probably six months or so before. So it

16:12.422 --> 16:19.050
was, I went to midshipman school in September of 43 
and graduated in December. Oh, so it was three or

16:19.330 --> 16:20.551
four months. Well, I thought my luck had run out 
because 90, 7% of our midshipmen class were

16:25.109 --> 16:37.503
assigned to a small craft in the Navy with the great 
majority of those being sent to the Pacific area.

16:38.405 --> 16:39.726
But I lucked out again. I got an assignment. I was in 
the LCTs, which is landing craft tanks, which is a

16:41.188 --> 16:46.154
small thing. It can carry three tanks on its deck, 
and it's kind of like a floating bathtub. But I went

16:51.788 --> 17:00.321
to New Orleans to pick it up and to get my crew and 
they put me on top of a larger landing craft called

16:51.788 --> 17:00.321
an LSD. We got outfitted, went back to Norfolk, 
picked up some stuff there and then started our 30

17:01.643 --> 17:10.016
day crossing of the Atlantic. Supposedly to go to 
Italy to do some work on the beachheads there in

17:17.843 --> 17:20.046
Italy. Now you were incident at this point? 
Incident at this point. What was your duty aboard

17:23.731 --> 17:25.153
the LST? Well, I wasn't supposed to have any duty 
aboard the LST but the captain of the LST made you do

17:26.375 --> 17:35.567
everything he wanted you to do. He stood all the 
watches and did everything just like a regular

17:35.607 --> 17:40.454
officer did. Anyway, we got to North Africa. They 
launched us off, put the That's LST at a list, and

17:46.784 --> 17:51.590
they had us on a special box. They knocked those 
blocks out, and we slid off into the water. And I was

17:56.516 --> 18:05.386
supposed to leave the next morning for the Anzio 
beachhead to relieve some ships that were taking a

17:56.516 --> 18:05.386
beating up there. About 10 o'clock that night, 
officers came aboard and said, Camp, you have new

18:07.950 --> 18:14.918
orders. we're sending you to England. We're gonna 
tow you back to Algiers, which has a crane big

18:18.066 --> 18:26.074
enough to lift you back on the LSD. And then, so I 
took another 30-day little thing, because they

18:27.135 --> 18:35.504
just go way out into the Atlantic and back to 
Mississippi. The dangers. Incidentally, on the

18:38.827 --> 18:41.530
way over, Just as we passed, or if we were nearing 
Gibraltar, we were attacked by JU-88s. And we

18:51.120 --> 18:58.066
ended up, because I had a captain on that LST that 
was a pretty smart old guy. And he got away from all

18:59.027 --> 19:03.230
the other ships and was out by himself, so to speak. 
And we brought a JU-88 down. He kind of grazed our

19:07.293 --> 19:11.517
deck and that. brought him down, and we got a silver 
star. That's really the most dangerous part of the

19:14.557 --> 19:17.220
war for me. And then when we got to England, we 
landed in Ireland, because we had to go to another

19:19.604 --> 19:32.002
place that had a crane big enough to lift me off 
again. So I got off actually in Cardiff, Wales,

19:32.022 --> 19:41.976
right across from Ireland, and then sailed around 
the

19:42.580 --> 19:53.674
base, by the time we got there, they had all of the 
assignments already made for D-Day. So they had us

19:55.096 --> 19:57.259
in reserve. And I got an assignment that could not 
be, I could not land on the beach until it was

19:58.100 --> 20:06.951
secured. So I didn't go in until D plus six. And I had 
three tanks that I took in. Then after I took those

20:14.481 --> 20:20.388
tanks in on D plus six, my assignment was to unload 
ammunition. And I would go alongside of these

20:21.509 --> 20:29.338
ships and they would put 100 tons of ammunition on 
my deck. And then when the tide. So your LCT was like

20:30.800 --> 20:33.323
a lighter going back and forth. We had those big 
tides on that beach there. We'd go in on the beach at

20:37.745 --> 20:43.032
high tide and anchor. The tide would go out and then 
we'd drop our bow down and they'd just come on there

20:44.173 --> 20:54.146
with trucks and take everything off. Well that was 
all right until, of course the first night or two it

20:54.786 --> 21:04.338
wasn't very nice because you had aircraft coming 
over and attacking the beach every night. But if

21:04.378 --> 21:05.760
you ever got hit, You didn't have to worry because 
that was the end. Anyway, in July, first part of

21:09.806 --> 21:15.876
July, we had a terrible storm on the beach. And if 
the Germans had really known how bad off we were,

21:17.258 --> 21:29.638
they could have wiped us out because we got down to 
the fact that there was less after that storm. all

21:30.040 --> 21:31.642
got tore up there. Mulberries were all busted up. 
Oh, everything was busted up. They had at one time

21:36.808 --> 21:42.656
less than 12 hours of gasoline that they could 
deliver. They had to beach ships that had

21:42.676 --> 21:50.525
gasoline, these five gallon things of gasoline on 
them. They'd beach those and take it off that way.

21:54.070 --> 22:04.945
And so I worked on that beach until that storm, but I 
had gotten pretty badly torn up, so they towed me

21:54.070 --> 22:04.945
back to England and put me in repair.

22:07.408 --> 22:11.774
I stayed there for, I guess, about six weeks, and 
then went back to the beach. But I wasn't on the

22:12.875 --> 22:21.006
beach for about less than one month until somebody 
came on board and said, Well, you've got a new

22:21.442 --> 22:23.044
assignment. I said, I do. He said, yes, you're the 
new flotilla officer for the

22:24.385 --> 22:30.632
group. He said, you're going back to England. So I 
went back to England and lived in a nice home that we

22:33.415 --> 22:39.262
had for our headquarters. Where was this? It was in 
Salkham. It's in southern England, close to

22:42.666 --> 22:46.790
Plymouth. Oh, OK. And we had a beautiful 
headquarters there. And so we stayed there until

22:52.188 --> 22:55.171
the war was over. When the war in Europe was over, my 
commanding officer asked four of us that had been

22:57.053 --> 23:15.013
on his staff if we would like to go back with him and 
be on a new staff, probably in the Pacific. And we

23:15.254 --> 23:17.937
said yes, we'd like to. So we all went back to 
Norfolk. and went out to a little base called Camp

23:21.685 --> 23:25.569
Bradford. Now, did you fly back or did you take a 
ship back? Oh, we took a ship back. The old George

23:29.254 --> 23:30.795
Washington. Oh, the old liner, yeah. Yeah. Worst 
ride in the world. Not only that, but it had been a

23:37.663 --> 23:48.756
hospital ship, and the beds were just metal things 
with a little pad on it, so it was like sleeping. We

23:50.828 --> 23:52.230
came home that way.

23:57.879 --> 24:18.152
When we got to New York, when the ship got to New 
York, when we got out of the narrows, they came

23:57.879 --> 24:18.152
aboard to give us assignments

23:57.879 --> 24:18.152
because we would have to stay in New York for a week 
or so until they decided where they were going to

23:57.879 --> 24:18.152
send us and this sort of thing. So the four of us were 
standing on the deck. This wave came up and said,

24:21.441 --> 24:25.910
where would you all like to stay in New York? What 
hotel? And thinking that we were being a little

24:28.676 --> 24:34.247
smart ass, we said, the Hilton. Well, it was the 
Waldorf then. And she said, OK. So she gave us a

24:39.978 --> 24:41.862
suite at the Waldorf.

24:44.879 --> 24:46.902
Of course, the Warduff was not like it is today. It 
wasn't air conditioned. It had ceiling fans. But

24:50.528 --> 24:51.449
it was nice. It was beautiful. And I laugh and say 
that the quality of the Warduff was really shown

24:53.612 --> 25:01.544
when I left there to go home. I threw an old pair of 
shoes they were practically had holes in the

25:02.666 --> 25:07.373
bottom of them in the trash can. When I got home, 
they had mailed them home to me.

25:15.136 --> 25:18.960
Of course, leather was then very hard to get. They 
thought that I shouldn't throw them away, I guess.

25:24.847 --> 25:32.996
Anyway, we were stationed there in Camp Bradford 
waiting on an assignment and had nothing to do. So

25:33.937 --> 25:42.527
the four of us played bridge from 8 o'clock in the 
morning to 5 o'clock in the afternoon when we could

25:33.937 --> 25:42.527
leave the base.

25:44.600 --> 25:49.647
Then the war in Japan was over. We still hadn't been 
assigned out there. So what they were doing, we

25:52.511 --> 25:56.096
were all four of us were single. And they- Now you'd 
been promoted though. You were- Oh yeah, I was- You

25:59.160 --> 26:03.786
were a lieutenant probably or- I was either a JG or a 
lieutenant. I can't remember which. I think I was

26:06.350 --> 26:10.135
just a JG.

26:12.359 --> 26:24.705
We all got assignments to going out to the Pacific, 
except that they all went out to ships in the

26:12.359 --> 26:24.705
Pacific to relieve officers who had enough points 
to come home. And so they would bring the ship back,

26:25.607 --> 26:27.972
you see. Where did I go? I went to Long Beach, 
California. I became what was called a passenger

26:33.132 --> 26:37.016
transportation officer. In other words, I was 
arranging troop trains for people who, as they'd

26:37.056 --> 26:45.365
get to the States, to go back to bases for 
separation. And so that was my assignment for four

26:46.386 --> 26:48.748
years. Actually, ships quit coming in to

26:49.028 --> 26:56.856
the Los Angeles harbor. San Pedro. Yeah, San Pedro 
there. And we were getting almost nothing. So I'd

27:02.832 --> 27:11.801
go to the office and check my dispatches and take 
care of what little there was, and I was free the

27:02.832 --> 27:11.801
rest of the day. Now, about this time, you must have 
made a decision that maybe you wanted to stay in the

27:12.002 --> 27:17.547
Navy a little longer. Well, lots of people were 
doing this and were staying, but I was looking at it

27:17.707 --> 27:28.739
that, hell, that in a few months there wouldn't be 
any Navy like we have now. Right. And that the

27:29.580 --> 27:31.742
people from out of... Annapolis would get all the 
plum officer assignments. I didn't think there

27:37.559 --> 27:39.601
was much future in the Navy. So I planned 
immediately to come back to A&M and go to school and

27:39.641 --> 27:46.229
finish my degree. So although I could have gotten 
out in about April, I stayed until August. Stay on

27:55.465 --> 27:57.448
Navy pay. This is August of 46. Yeah. And then I came 
home and started school in September. And stayed,

28:03.639 --> 28:11.612
actually, I finished up my degree and started my 
master's there. And jobs, though, were just

28:11.632 --> 28:17.862
absolutely impossible to get almost at that time. 
I went out in West Texas to Breckenridge to visit a

28:19.023 --> 28:27.232
cousin of mine who had lived with us when I was a 
child. We were almost like brothers and sisters

28:27.392 --> 28:30.715
rather than cousins. And she had been a home 
economics teacher out there for quite a long time.

28:37.883 --> 28:43.849
And I went out there during actually my spring 
break, I think. At lunchtime, the superintendent

28:44.808 --> 28:51.494
came over and sat down at the table and got to 
talking, and he wanted to know what I was doing. And

28:51.594 --> 28:57.980
I told him, I said, well, I'm finishing up some work 
down at A&M, and I don't know what I'm going to do.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.681
I'm looking for a job. He said, come in and talk to 
me. So I went in and talked to him, and he offered me a

29:02.464 --> 29:11.953
job teaching in an elementary school. So I went out 
there. taught for two years and then became

29:14.896 --> 29:21.685
principal of this elementary school and stayed 
there another two years. Well, there wasn't any

29:22.126 --> 29:25.190
Navy anywhere close. So I hadn't really done 
anything. You weren't separated. We were just

29:31.398 --> 29:36.344
released to inactive duty is what we were doing. 
Out of a clear blue sky, about Christmas time of 50,

29:36.364 --> 29:43.654
I got a a letter from the Commandant of the 8th Naval 
District. And he said, we're inviting all

29:48.154 --> 30:00.427
officers in the district who have had prior 
personnel experience to come in for a two-week

29:48.154 --> 30:00.427
conference to work on a special project. Would you 
be interested in doing that? If so, let us know. So I

30:06.373 --> 30:13.641
wrote him back and said, yes, I'd be glad to have 
some Navy pay as compared to teaching pay and Lynn

30:14.532 --> 30:44.337
and I were planning to get married that year in 
March and this conference was going to be about the

30:14.532 --> 30:44.337
same time so we decided well hey we'll send our 
wedding and get married and then go to New Orleans

30:14.532 --> 30:44.337
for the conference and I'll attend that in the 
daytime and we can then have fun well it that was

30:14.532 --> 30:44.337
what we did and It turned out that they kept wanting 
me to come back down there because we wrote the

30:45.177 --> 31:01.081
manual that set up mobilization stations in case 
there was a general mobilization. As a result of

31:01.101 --> 31:12.619
it, we were also in a special status so that they 
couldn't draft us, and that's why I missed the

31:01.101 --> 31:12.619
Korean War.

31:14.692 --> 31:19.598
We, they wanted us to come back and revise the 
manual and this sort of thing every year. I'd been

31:19.638 --> 31:34.675
doing this for several years and realized that I 
had about 10 or 11 years that were good quality

31:19.638 --> 31:34.675
years as far as qualifying for retirement was 
concerned. And I thought, maybe I better get

31:35.977 --> 31:37.999
serious about this. So I talked to them down there 
and they said, why don't you let us put you in a pay

31:38.059 --> 31:43.045
status in San Antonio? So they assigned me to a unit 
here, and I'd go down for about two weeks. I went

31:49.247 --> 32:02.822
weekly drill, you know, and everything, and then 
take two weeks every summer, which I would do in New

31:49.247 --> 32:02.822
Orleans, until the Navy got a little picky because 
I wasn't going to sea, getting any sea duty. So I

32:03.863 --> 32:11.952
reached the point where I had to go to sea every 
other year, and I'd go to New Orleans every other

32:03.863 --> 32:11.952
year. But it became, I developed a lot of good 
friends. What would you do in your sea duty every

32:17.035 --> 32:19.077
other year? I mean, was that two weeks again? Yes, 
two weeks. You'd go to sea. I went one year on an

32:22.960 --> 32:25.743
aircraft carrier out of San Diego. I most often 
went on a tin can or destroyer out of New Orleans.

32:32.849 --> 32:34.931
And one year I went. So this wasn't a two-week 
cruise, was it? Yeah. Oh, they just go out two weeks

32:38.094 --> 32:39.375
and then come back? Yeah, it was a training cruise, 
strictly. Oh. Is this all reserve officers? All

32:44.402 --> 32:48.308
reserve people, officers and enlisted. They'd be 
both on board. Usually they'd have these training

32:50.652 --> 32:59.666
ships that would do this, and so half of the crew 
would be regular and half of it would be reserve.

32:59.746 --> 33:01.989
The captain was a regular Navy officer? Oh, yeah. 
Was his XO a regular Navy officer? Oh, yeah. All the

33:05.595 --> 33:10.322
top brass were regular Navy officers. Sometimes 
you'd have assignments working with them, but it

33:11.264 --> 33:17.512
was strictly an observation type thing. For 
instance, we went on that carrier out of San Diego,

33:18.193 --> 33:34.234
and that was training pilots who had not been, had 
duty landing on board a carrier. So we worked 24

33:34.805 --> 33:37.508
hours a day. It was night and day. You were only on 
duty half the time. But it was a very interesting

33:46.338 --> 33:49.602
experience. When did you do that in San Diego? Was 
that in the late 50s, early 60s? Probably the late

33:54.027 --> 33:58.472
50s or early 60s, something like that. That would 
have been interesting. Yeah. I went to

34:03.543 --> 34:07.407
Charleston, South Carolina one time. But all the 
assignments were interesting. Like one time, I

34:09.950 --> 34:21.622
went out of New Orleans and I had been late getting 
on board, so I got the worst officer quarters, the

34:09.950 --> 34:21.622
last one left, which was right up in the bow. And 
before we got out of the river, we got a radio

34:22.462 --> 34:28.909
message to prepare for heavy seas when you hit the 
Gulf. Well, I mean, that was the most miserable

34:29.463 --> 34:33.792
night of my Navy career, I think. The seas were so 
heavy. I was up in that bow and it was going like this

34:37.099 --> 34:40.826
and like this at the same time. I couldn't stay in 
that bunk. I finally moved up to the lounge and just

34:43.953 --> 34:51.488
slept on the couch up there. Well, we went like to 
one time to Cuba, one time to Mobile, and all around

34:53.425 --> 35:01.976
that area. Usually we were a part of some special 
training assignment where we had duties on board

35:02.016 --> 35:12.990
that ship and some exercise. They had all kinds of 
training exercises they would do in the

35:13.050 --> 35:19.939
summertime in order to get training to reserve. So 
I enjoyed every minute of it. And finally, I got to

35:24.951 --> 35:32.341
the point where I was up to a full commander. And 
there

35:33.964 --> 35:50.348
were very few of us assignments in the reserve 
center here that would allow officers in that rank

35:33.964 --> 35:50.348
to be in those assignments. And I was a hold of the 
position and a lot of younger officers couldn't

35:51.138 --> 35:59.151
get promoted because of that. And so I finally, 
after I had about 24 years of active duty time, it

35:59.431 --> 36:13.033
was counting for retirement, I just went ahead and 
retired and let some of those younger officers. If

36:14.254 --> 36:15.897
I'd stayed one more year, Hindsight's always 
better than foresight. I would have probably made

36:18.910 --> 36:22.674
one more promotion, which was a biggie. Yeah, the 
captain. Yeah. But I didn't. And at the time, I

36:27.659 --> 36:30.221
didn't think that he was so important. But I didn't 
realize that

36:30.682 --> 36:38.349
pay promotions were going to continue to go up and 
up. And so my reserve retirement has become more

36:38.590 --> 36:46.137
and more important as I've gotten older, 
especially in San Antonio that is such a military

36:46.572 --> 37:03.330
town, but we've got such excellent medical 
facilities as well as the commissary and all this

36:46.572 --> 37:03.330
PX and all this sort of thing. So

37:04.612 --> 37:14.082
I really look back with a lot of pride on the days 
that I was in the Yeah, I can understand that. Now,

37:15.568 --> 37:16.749
did you continue to teach? No, after we got married 
the next summer. Because even at, I was an

37:22.377 --> 37:28.945
unmarried principal. I was getting credit for 
four years of military, active military service.

37:33.831 --> 37:38.297
And I was still, my take-home pay was less than $300 
a month.

37:41.112 --> 37:48.520
And so when we got married, and I was 30 years old by 
that time, and we wanted to have some family. We

37:48.580 --> 37:51.203
knew we weren't going to be able to fool around too 
many years. So the first summer after we got

37:52.305 --> 37:59.553
married in March, we went to Houston looking for a 
job. And I had a cousin who got me to apply with

38:01.395 --> 38:10.225
General Mills for a job.

38:12.061 --> 38:15.866
It was a good interview and everything, but they 
had no openings at the time. So I got back to school

38:17.588 --> 38:22.094
and got started in about the middle of September. 
They called me and said, we've got an opening in San

38:23.476 --> 38:27.821
Antonio. Would you be interested in going to San 
Antonio? And I said, well, I don't know. I've never

38:33.468 --> 38:37.934
been to San Antonio, but been through it once, but 
that's all. I said, I've just started A school

38:41.660 --> 38:42.642
year? Well, why don't you come down and look at it? 
Well, I came down here and they made me an offer of a

38:47.249 --> 38:52.056
job here. And I went back then, went into the 
superintendent's office and told him what had

38:52.096 --> 38:57.705
happened. And he said, you know that I can't pay you 
that kind of money. And he said, I don't think you

39:04.535 --> 39:06.458
should turn it down. He said, I'll find somebody to 
take your place. He said, go on and accept it. So we

39:12.590 --> 39:20.799
came down here sometime in October and went to work 
for General Mills. Well, it turned out that it was a

39:20.839 --> 39:38.397
bad choice only because that all the, my territory 
ran all the way from San Antonio out to Sanderson.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.219
And up through the hill country. In the city of San 
Antonio itself, I had nothing. So you were on the

39:44.721 --> 39:46.464
road all the time. All the road. So I was on the road 
at least three weeks out of four. And the first year

39:49.869 --> 39:56.660
that you're married, that was not very happening. 
Well, in December, I fell on an icy sidewalk and

39:56.680 --> 40:03.150
broke a leg. And it was the kind of break that they 
couldn't put a cast on. We were living in a second

40:10.000 --> 40:13.165
floor apartment. It didn't even have a shower in 
it. It had a tub in it. Well, that was the most

40:17.773 --> 40:19.676
miserable six weeks I had. But I spent them reading 
one ads and everything. And so by the time that my

40:24.423 --> 40:30.273
six weeks was up, I had accepted another job. But I 
continued in the Navy.

40:38.215 --> 40:39.837
So you stayed in the San Antonio area. I stayed in 
the San Antonio area. That was so you could keep the

40:41.640 --> 40:43.222
reserve. Well, it was. And the other thing was that 
when I'd been out in West Texas, I'd had lots of

40:44.945 --> 40:49.872
problems with silence trouble. And I had almost 
nothing here in San Antonio. Oh, indeed. So I was

40:54.038 --> 40:58.545
very anxious to stay here. And so we stayed here all 
these years as a result of that. The first house

41:07.426 --> 41:24.827
that we lived in here, we stayed in it 35 years, 
simply because after my wife decided to teach,

41:07.426 --> 41:24.827
she's one of these people who is not a morning 
person, and she liked being five minutes from

41:07.426 --> 41:24.827
school. And so we didn't move for a long time. About 
the time that I retired from, I worked the last 25

41:28.872 --> 41:35.020
years before I retired was with Mutual of New York. 
And after I retired from them, I built this house,

41:39.952 --> 41:47.980
which was the first thing, my first project. And 
then I did some substitute teaching at Hersk High

41:49.262 --> 41:56.469
School for a few years, and then I got tired of that. 
Now I'm to the point of where I just try to have

41:57.710 --> 42:04.517
enough money to do as much traveling as possible. 
That's good. Where have you been traveling? Well,

42:09.402 --> 42:14.909
if you look at that map up there, you'll see we've 
pretty well, we've been to South America twice.

42:16.210 --> 42:18.073
We've been to Europe probably six or seven times. 
Oh, the buttons are places you've been? Yeah. Oh,

42:19.995 --> 42:21.657
you've done a good job then. We've been to 
Australia and New Zealand. We've been down to

42:25.381 --> 42:34.572
Singapore and to Hong Kong and Manila and Java. in 
that area. We haven't done much as far as Africa is

42:37.409 --> 42:41.713
concerned. We haven't been. Lynn went over one 
year and kind of went into one little place in

42:43.795 --> 42:59.591
Africa, but that's about the extent of it outside 
of the two places that I got into when I was there in

42:43.795 --> 42:59.591
that short period of time in the war. We're going 
back in October this year We're flying to Paris,

43:05.753 --> 43:21.938
gonna be there for a week, and then we're gonna take 
a train over into Munich, because Germany is the

43:05.753 --> 43:21.938
cheaper place to rent a car in Europe. And we'll 
pick up a car there. Our favorite place in Europe is

43:24.802 --> 43:33.195
a little village up on the side of the mountain 
above Innsbruck called Muters. And we're going to

43:34.255 --> 43:36.217
spend a couple of days there. And then try to make, 
neither of us have been into Italy. And we're going

43:42.445 --> 43:45.929
