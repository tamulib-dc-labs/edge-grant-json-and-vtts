00:01.381 --> 00:02.242
Long hours? Yeah, long hours. And so the first 
thing you do is analyze as to whether or not you

00:03.865 --> 00:10.814
really want to be a leader. It's a lot easier to be in 
the background, because if you're on the front

00:11.035 --> 00:18.706
line, everybody's looking at you. A lot more 
demanding. And it's a lot more demanding. And

00:22.591 --> 00:25.195
there's a lot more pressure on you. So the question 
is, can you stand the pressure? or you're going to

00:28.280 --> 00:31.344
get ulcers over it. And I found that a lot of people 
were just made poor commanders. In fact,

00:40.977 --> 00:51.872
Napoleon, I think, said that there are no bad 
regiments, there are only bad colonels.

00:51.892 --> 00:55.357
The second, okay, the first thing is if you want to 
be a leader, okay, there's one. I'll tell you the

00:55.958 --> 00:57.780
next thing is, decide what job you want. Then make a 
study of that particular job as to what

01:02.583 --> 01:20.763
qualifications the individual who has a job has 
and draw yourself up an educational plan, a job

01:02.583 --> 01:20.763
plan to be qualified to take that job. Go out and get 
the training or the education that's necessary.

01:24.187 --> 01:28.071
Education and whatever, if it's a And I would say 
that almost any leader needs to be able to be an

01:29.620 --> 01:41.291
accountant type. An accountant type. What does 
that mean? Well, I don't mean an accountant type.

01:47.757 --> 01:59.087
He needs to have the ability to

01:47.757 --> 01:59.087
keep the books or look at a financial statement and 
be able to analyze a financial statement. and to be

01:59.810 --> 02:07.140
able to analyze financial data. I think in the 
building business, had I not been a professional

02:08.983 --> 02:21.540
bookkeeper or accountant, I would have been lost 
if you had to depend on somebody else to keep the

02:08.983 --> 02:21.540
books. Because in the early stages of any company, 
why the critical item is your finances. And you

02:31.145 --> 02:35.250
have to be on top of it on a day-to-day basis. So you 
just have to, as far as I'm concerned, you have to be

02:36.231 --> 02:50.088
a bookkeeper of some sort to,

02:36.231 --> 02:50.088
in regards of what job you are. Almost all the 
students that we are sponsoring down at Texas A&M,

02:50.348 --> 02:57.998
I recommend it's somewhere along the line. one or 
two of their electives be an accountant so that

02:58.585 --> 03:11.959
they know how to

02:58.585 --> 03:11.959
keep books and be able to analyze whether or not 
they're making a profit. Even if they're working

03:12.720 --> 03:19.827
for somebody else, why should they be able to find 
out if they themselves are making a profit? And the

03:19.847 --> 03:27.715
other thing that has done me the most good is being a 
typist. I learned typing early and I figured I got

03:28.673 --> 03:37.001
my poem at the west point by typing letters. All my 
research and books and things of this sort, I typed

03:37.201 --> 03:43.367
it out. I'll agree that now your copying machine 
has come into the being where for five cents you can

03:43.387 --> 03:57.381
put a book and get a copy of a page that you 
particularly want and file it away. then why it was

03:57.952 --> 04:07.362
a matter of typing these

03:57.952 --> 04:07.362
jewels that you ran across in books.

04:12.648 --> 04:25.461
I think that's along with the other 
qualifications of enthusiasm and with

04:12.648 --> 04:25.461
imagination, willing to work night and day to to 
reach your goal, I think that's it.

04:32.917 --> 04:33.718
Okay. There's another thing that you said during 
our interview, I think it might have been

04:33.738 --> 04:45.874
yesterday, that I was interested in, the last 
thing that I'd like to talk about as far as

04:33.738 --> 04:45.874
leadership is concerned. You said that you have to 
be willing to rock the boat. Now, I've heard a lot of

04:49.499 --> 04:55.887
people say about the military, well, it's a guy 
that gets ahead who doesn't rock the boat, he just

04:49.499 --> 04:55.887
fits in and just takes the orders and carries them 
out. And you're telling me that you have to be able

04:58.846 --> 05:01.670
to rock the boat. Would you explain that? Well, 
you're...

05:03.552 --> 05:25.620
Well, if you... Well, it's the same thing as 
whether or not you're rocking a boat or create

05:03.552 --> 05:25.620
waves or... As far as I'm concerned, if you're 
going to be a commander, why, you have to be willing

05:03.552 --> 05:25.620
to... look at a situation and if it requires 
changing why get it changed.

05:42.964 --> 05:48.614
And I'll agree that when you rock the boat you come 
to somebody's attention. And if you don't rock the

05:49.635 --> 05:52.620
boat why then might get a good efficiency report, 
but sooner or later, as far as I'm concerned,

05:53.697 --> 06:00.143
you're going to be found out.

06:03.647 --> 06:21.645
Because I used to write efficiency reports on, 
when I was in the National Security Agency, we used

06:03.647 --> 06:21.645
to have some members of there that I had to write 
efficiency reports on. Well, the guys that didn't

06:24.735 --> 06:43.872
rock the boat, well, you just said, well, you 
hadn't heard anything good about him, you hadn't

06:24.735 --> 06:43.872
heard anything bad about him, so you rate him 
probably above average because he had been

06:24.735 --> 06:43.872
selected as,

06:24.735 --> 06:43.872
but if he had been rocking the boat, well, then he 
comes to attention, so you knew what he was doing.

06:43.932 --> 06:51.058
Now, maybe if you didn't like what he was doing, 
well, maybe you'd rate him down a little bit, but I

06:43.932 --> 06:51.058
just think that In other words, when you rock the 
boat in the military, you should make your ways,

06:51.562 --> 06:57.589
but you should be pretty sure that you're on the 
right path. On the right track, yeah. Because if

06:59.652 --> 07:03.356
you rock the boat and you're not on the right path, 
then you could be in trouble.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.664
Is this part of the creativity aspect then? Well, I 
think the... Coming up with ideas? Creativity is

07:13.388 --> 07:19.155
to come up with ideas, and actually you get your 
ideas from reading magazines, reading books,

07:19.675 --> 07:24.182
collecting documents. And then when you need to, 
well, I think this is education. I think you're

07:32.074 --> 07:42.489
really, education is the, you are educating 
yourself not to have something stored in your

07:32.074 --> 07:42.489
brain, but where you can find it. And this is the 
reason that I've collected such an extensive file

07:48.683 --> 07:54.389
on how to be a success, how to be a failure.

07:57.131 --> 08:14.428
This, if I want to review how to be a success or the 
value of reading, you just go to a file, pick out all

07:57.131 --> 08:14.428
of these articles that have been written on it, and 
refresh yourself. And I used to take vile

08:14.448 --> 08:16.530
speeches. which is a very good magazine on the good 
speeches and of the week. I think it's almost a

08:27.884 --> 08:30.147
weekly magazine. It was a weekly and maybe a 
monthly now. And I used to take that and there's

08:33.351 --> 08:44.847
always someone made a speech that really put words 
in the right contacts that you liked and it fits in

08:45.367 --> 08:56.200
right with your idea so you just tear it out and put 
it in a file someplace.

08:56.220 --> 09:05.772
But I think if you're out in front you just can't be a

08:56.220 --> 09:05.772
non-entity as a commander. You just have to be 
willing to, as you say, rock the boat and everybody

09:05.792 --> 09:14.142
will... Make those decisions. It'll attract the 
attention of both the people above, and it'll also

09:15.117 --> 09:19.542
attract all the attention of the people below. 
Well, during this interview, we've talked about

09:22.226 --> 09:30.936
your early years, your education, both at A&M, and 
compared that with West Point, your military

09:22.226 --> 09:30.936
career, your ideas on leadership. There must be 
something else that... Is there anything else

09:31.737 --> 09:36.703
that we've left? I'm sure that in every man's life, 
there's a lot of things that you leave out that are

09:36.763 --> 09:45.073
important to the development of a general 
officer, but is there anything that you'd just

09:36.763 --> 09:45.073
like to to talk on before we close because I'm out of 
questions. Well I'm out of talking I think. Okay.

09:54.717 --> 09:58.323
Well thank you very much General Hetherington for 
this. I know Texas A&M, the former students and I

09:58.884 --> 10:02.050
really appreciate it.
