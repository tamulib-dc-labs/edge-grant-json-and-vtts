WEBVTT

00:03.980 --> 00:13.631
If they couldn't step into that kind of a position, 
then we were competitive because they wanted to go

00:03.980 --> 00:13.631
to a university to work. And we had some people from 
Lamar and other universities in Texas that were

00:14.152 --> 00:22.321
interested in coming on board with us. So we were 
probably in between, probably in between the the

00:28.347 --> 00:36.294
Southwest Texas, Lamar, and lower than the 
University of Texas, Michigan, and Columbia. We

00:36.634 --> 00:38.316
were probably in between. Do you remember some 
steps of accomplishment that in hindsight you now

00:39.456 --> 00:54.129
realize were key steps of progress during those 
early years? Yeah, I think this block program

00:58.098 --> 01:16.245
began to blossom and we would eventually begin to 
see what was called a professional senior

00:58.098 --> 01:16.245
semester program where students would have an 
increased amount of time in student teaching. But

01:16.265 --> 01:22.194
they didn't have to worry about going off to other 
departments for courses. They could take this as a

01:22.294 --> 01:25.759
block and they could do a lot of their work out in the 
public school setting and almost spend, after the

01:25.739 --> 01:40.137
first, say, six weeks on campus, they could almost 
spend the entire day, five days a week out in the

01:40.606 --> 01:49.840
public school setting, finishing coursework, 
doing student teaching, and so forth. And that

01:49.900 --> 01:53.305
program, I thought, was very good. It gave them an 
edge. Any number of personnel from public school

01:57.392 --> 02:08.048
systems were telling us over and over, they wanted 
our students because they liked what they were

01:57.392 --> 02:08.048
getting. If they ever got one of our students, they 
were back for more because I think that gave them an

02:08.635 --> 02:32.382
edge being out in the public school setting for 
that length of time instead of just going out,

02:08.635 --> 02:32.382
running out and teaching a course or teaching 
classes for an hour or two and then running back to

02:08.635 --> 02:32.382
campus to take a course and then the next day 
running out there and then coming back the next day

02:32.362 --> 02:35.926
and taking a course. It was too fragmented. This 
gave them the full-blown picture because, for

02:37.689 --> 02:58.514
example, if they were doing all of this in the fall, 
they had to go out before, even if we weren't open

02:37.689 --> 02:58.514
yet at the university, they had to go out and 
participate in the opening preparation days of

02:37.689 --> 02:58.514
the school. They followed the public school 
schedule, not our schedule, so to speak. And so

03:05.543 --> 03:10.771
they really understood what education was all 
about when they finished. And we were proud of

03:10.911 --> 03:13.956
them. I'd say that was a key factor. I think another 
two key factors that I really enjoyed watching

03:16.600 --> 03:29.740
grow was the whole shift now when it came to the 
doctoral program. particularly the

03:30.260 --> 03:32.062
dissertation area. The dissertation became more 
refined. It became more specialized, more

03:36.427 --> 03:40.052
in-depth. And when our students finished, we 
really felt confident that they go out and

03:40.072 --> 03:53.768
whatever they were doing their research in, they 
could step in and pick that up immediately and run

03:40.072 --> 03:53.768
with it, regardless of where they went. And a lot of 
them did end up going to major universities

03:53.888 --> 03:57.853
because of that. The other major shift that I saw 
that was good was the shift to paying more

04:04.077 --> 04:16.393
attention to research grants, getting money from 
federal sources, private sources to run their

04:04.077 --> 04:16.393
research. When I first came, that was very, very 
small. It wasn't a very large amount. Frank Hubert

04:23.342 --> 04:33.696
and Earl Jones had hit on some pretty big programs, 
creative application of technology to

04:23.342 --> 04:33.696
education. But other than a couple of those kinds 
of programs, the research dollars weren't

04:33.676 --> 04:40.108
flowing in. I appreciated seeing that grow. Were 
you in the department, was the department also

04:44.695 --> 04:51.083
responsible for the work and practice teaching? 
Did you all supervise that out in the local

04:51.103 --> 04:54.007
schools? Yes. With which schools did you all most? 
Just about every one of them in Bryan College

04:58.853 --> 05:02.658
Station because we had so many. But primarily 
these two school districts? Primarily here.

05:06.803 --> 05:10.247
Eventually we, they didn't have enough enough 
places and we had to start reaching out beyond here

05:10.227 --> 05:28.624
to Somerville, Conroe, and then further down the 
pike we even had to establish programs with as far

05:10.227 --> 05:28.624
away as the Dallas area and so forth to get some How 
difficult was it to establish a new relationship

05:28.604 --> 05:33.311
with the school district? Pretty easy. Again, I 
think that whole experience with Frank Hubert and

05:35.355 --> 05:47.234
Paul Hensarling, people like Les Richardson and 
so forth, paid off that way. I think these were...

05:48.736 --> 05:52.143
people who were well known among the public school 
people. And so they were pretty open about

05:52.924 --> 06:01.641
discussing with us possibilities of placing 
student teachers and then grabbing them. They

06:02.102 --> 06:03.765
liked our student teachers too. Can you remember 
any anecdotes or stories about where some Aggie

06:04.967 --> 06:11.520
student teachers succeeded?

06:13.812 --> 06:22.866
Where somebody had an example of the quality of one 
of the student teachers from here, something they

06:13.812 --> 06:22.866
did? No, that one doesn't come across to me. Now we 
had lots of success as far as our doctoral students

06:30.437 --> 06:35.365
going out. I had just the ones I chaired, for 
example. One became vice president of McMurray

06:41.278 --> 06:44.305
State. Another one became president of a junior 
college. Wait, let's go back up. You said McMurray

06:52.204 --> 06:53.708
State. Isn't it? McMurray, Abilene? Just 
McMurray. McMurray. Okay, yeah, that's right.

07:00.995 --> 07:05.881
Murray State is a Kentucky Teachers College. 
That's right. Others that you can recall down

07:07.223 --> 07:11.589
through the years and where they are now? Yeah, one 
of the stars to come out of the program, I thought,

07:11.729 --> 07:16.074
was Cecil Drain. Cecil had... been in the military 
and was kind of predicted to go pretty far in the

07:19.186 --> 07:26.880
military. He was already a major. when he came into 
residence on his doctorate, and they funded, the

07:29.210 --> 07:42.523
military funded him everything for three full 
years at a major salary, and he got a promotion to

07:29.210 --> 07:42.523
lieutenant colonel. He went back to San Antonio 
and worked with the, at Fort Hood down there,

07:43.344 --> 07:56.938
teaching in the field of anesthetism. And when he 
retired from the military, he immediately

07:57.205 --> 08:14.262
stepped in as head of the Department of Allied 
Health and Anesthesia and so forth at Virginia

07:57.205 --> 08:14.262
Commonwealth University. So he was really... And 
he had written books. He had books that were the

08:17.225 --> 08:22.150
Bible in the military as far as... operating room 
functioning and anesthesia and so forth. He was

08:28.163 --> 08:34.136
actually the author of the books that they were 
using to train people with. So Cecil was a big star.

08:36.862 --> 08:41.652
Public school wise, Libby Gardner comes to mind. 
Libby finished her doctoral program with us and

08:42.717 --> 08:55.691
stepped in as an assistant principal over in 
Conroe and then became a principal and then

08:42.717 --> 08:55.691
assistant superintendent. She's down in Conroe 
ISD. There have been a lot of examples like that

09:01.016 --> 09:06.362
where They've been pretty successful. Right. You 
were department head for five years. Five years.

09:12.867 --> 09:15.692
And so that takes us to 72 or three. Seventy-four. 
Four. Yeah. Then you become the, what was the term?

09:22.884 --> 09:26.631
Coordinator for higher education in the College 
of Education. And you did that how long? Did that

09:28.769 --> 09:44.704
until, let's see, 1980, when Chuck McCandless and 
Gordon Eaton and Frank Vandiver were the three

09:28.769 --> 09:44.704
administrative types at the university level. 
And I'd been working with Frank Hubert trying to

09:45.685 --> 09:57.696
get a center established for assisting faculty 
and teaching assistants in teaching. And when

09:58.942 --> 10:06.640
Dean Corrigan came in as the new Dean of College of 
Ed, he picked up on that. and convinced people we

10:07.312 --> 10:10.257
needed that. That's when McCandless headed up a 
committee that I served on for about a year with

10:10.477 --> 10:22.096
representatives from all the colleges. Out of 
that grew the proposal to open the Texas A&M

10:22.657 --> 10:29.809
University Center for Teaching Excellence. 
Vandiver asked me if I would head that up. Then I

10:34.213 --> 10:54.633
gave up the coordinating role of higher education 
in the college because I would be carrying on my

10:34.213 --> 10:54.633
responsibilities in the college as far as course 
teaching and doctoral students, but then half my

10:34.213 --> 10:54.633
time would be in the Center for Teaching 
Excellence. I did that. From what, 1980 to,

10:57.633 --> 11:06.989
must have been about 89, somewhere around there 
that I stepped out of that role. Right, now Hubert

11:07.009 --> 11:10.956
goes from being dean of education to chancellor. 
Yes. Directly. Yeah. And he continued to function

11:15.544 --> 11:21.514
until that change. In the college, and the college 
continued to grow and so forth. Yes. Who else in the

11:28.222 --> 11:43.671
70s, Williams being the president from late 
November 1970 until his illness in 1976, Do you

11:44.832 --> 11:57.544
remember any interaction with Williams, the 
Williams, Calhoun, Hubert

11:44.832 --> 11:57.544
leadership team? I never had that kind of, you 
know, I wasn't in that loop, so I don't know what was

11:57.925 --> 12:05.813
transpiring. But I did get acquainted with Jack 
Kenny Williams, and... I can remember being

12:11.343 --> 12:16.361
surprised. We'd played golf together out at 
Briarcrest Country Club. members out of

12:22.531 --> 12:36.317
Briarcrest and one day we got hooked up to play golf 
and the next week I got a little note from Jack Kenny

12:22.531 --> 12:36.317
Williams just saying, you know, I hope you're 
enjoying hitting the little white ball, you know,

12:22.531 --> 12:36.317
type of thing. And that impressed me that a 
president would take time after meeting a faculty

12:36.737 --> 12:43.269
member like that. He was marvelous with those 
little notes. and they were always handwritten

12:46.460 --> 12:59.542
and very much to the point but carried a message 
because I remember treasuring a few of those also.

13:00.003 --> 13:02.207
What was your impression of him as a human being? 
Oh, only positive. He epitomized to me what a

13:06.610 --> 13:13.346
university president should be. I think he had the 
credentials for it, too, and the experience. He

13:20.243 --> 13:26.833
had been, what, vice president at the University 
of Texas at Tennessee at Knoxville? The system.

13:28.455 --> 13:30.117
Chief academic officer for the system. Started 
out at Clemson as an entry-level Southern history

13:31.540 --> 13:49.626
faculty member and rose up to be what we would today 
call provost and then commissioner of higher

13:31.540 --> 13:49.626
education, but also was very, very, very 
committed to helping the Southern historically

13:50.399 --> 13:53.922
black land grant schools during his Clemson 
years. And so all across the South, he was known by

13:54.463 --> 14:00.888
that group of schools with great warmth as well. 
And through that and his Clemson experience, he

14:02.069 --> 14:11.578
had lots of Washington connections. Okay. Did you 
feel that he was strongly supportive of

14:12.319 --> 14:15.802
education? I did. I felt he was. And I think Frank 
Humer felt that way, too. As far as I know, he

14:19.525 --> 14:22.451
certainly was. And I felt that way too with Chuck 
McCandless and Gordon Eaton when they were over in

14:23.192 --> 14:30.727
the provost's office. That was just a feeling I had 
that they were supportive. Do you remember any

14:34.314 --> 14:36.859
examples of that? Well, the whole thing with the 
Center for Teaching Excellence, I think Chuck

14:37.582 --> 14:57.295
McCandless, and then when Gordon came in as the new 
provost, Chuck was serving at the beginning of

14:37.582 --> 14:57.295
that work as interim provost, as I recall. There 
just seemed to be an agreement between them two

14:57.275 --> 15:04.112
that this was something they wanted to see. I 
always had the impression that they were very

15:05.756 --> 15:11.932
positive toward education. I think during those 
first 15 years or so, it just seemed like everyone

15:16.428 --> 15:25.823
wanted this college of education to really be 
successful. Even if you looked at the financial

15:25.883 --> 15:35.859
allocations to the colleges, we were almost 
always right smack in the middle. There were

15:36.801 --> 15:37.542
always half the colleges that were getting less 
support, it seemed like. Of course, engineering

15:44.449 --> 15:51.199
and veterinary medicine, we're always getting a 
lot of support and so forth. But we seemed to be

15:51.219 --> 15:53.923
doing pretty well. And I attribute that to the 
administration at the time, from the provost on

15:54.924 --> 16:01.594
up, that they were supportive. Any examples you 
remember of the positive actions of John Calhoun

16:07.762 --> 16:12.844
or Mac Prescott when they were the chief academic 
officers. I never really, I knew both and had

16:13.482 --> 16:22.552
interacted because of committee functions that I 
was on. But I never really again had, I guess again

16:23.974 --> 16:36.449
by that time I was out of what you would call the loop 
where you were now finding out who was saying what

16:23.974 --> 16:36.449
and doing what and so forth. So I don't recall 
anything that I can share with you in that area. My

16:42.237 --> 17:10.776
mind just recalls a legend that I remember hearing 
very, very, very indirectly about a faculty

16:42.237 --> 17:10.776
member in education, and I know not what 
department, who supposedly came with a thick

16:42.237 --> 17:10.776
resume with all kinds of bells and whistles and was 
verbally abusive to students, always putting

16:42.237 --> 17:10.776
them down, always insulting them, and that as we 
heard the story, two or three of the students got

16:42.237 --> 17:10.776
his resume and went over to the library and and 
found that nothing in the printed resume of his

17:11.414 --> 17:20.669
publications and research matched up with what 
they could find in the library. And that according

17:21.650 --> 17:28.421
to this anecdote, they slid it under the door of the 
dean of education, Frank Hubert. Hubert then

17:29.262 --> 17:34.851
summoned the man to his office and asked him what 
comment he had to make of it. And the fellow was gone

17:35.412 --> 17:37.135
by... within a few hours. Does that ring a bell at 
all? No, it really doesn't. And it may not have been

17:43.110 --> 17:47.394
a true story, but it sounded... Well, that's 
another one you really... I would like to hear what

17:48.315 --> 17:52.439
Frank Hubert has to say. That's a great story. Let 
me throw in this one, which does not relate to

17:55.341 --> 17:59.265
education. In my years as dean of faculties, I 
would ask each of the departments to let me have 30

17:59.865 --> 18:04.810
minutes... of every prospective faculty 
member's visit to the campus, during which time I

18:05.920 --> 18:24.032
would try to tell them as much as I could and give 
them as much positive information, factual

18:05.920 --> 18:24.032
information, about what A&M really was and what it 
hoped to become. And among things I would say is

18:24.954 --> 18:29.582
that A&M is a comparatively conservative 
institution, and I mean by that that it doesn't

18:29.967 --> 18:33.712
change rapidly. We kind of go by tradition. And 
that if they wanted a real liberal school, they

18:37.257 --> 18:40.702
might not like us. And I would always assure the 
departments I would in no way try to evaluate the

18:42.043 --> 18:48.432
individuals. But it worked out that about once a 
year, I encountered somebody that really seemed

18:49.390 --> 18:57.085
to need some other review. And the one that I'm 
thinking about now particularly, his resume said

18:58.568 --> 19:05.441
he had a PhD from the University of Virginia. And I 
mentioned having done research at the Alderman

19:06.423 --> 19:09.930
Library. and he didn't know where it was. Well that 
was the, that is the library. So then on the spur of

19:16.936 --> 19:26.105
the moment I made up the names of three or four 
non-existent people that I knew in the department

19:16.936 --> 19:26.105
where he had done his dissertation. He knew all 
three of them quite well. So I called the

19:30.229 --> 19:34.133
department after he left the office and told them 
what had happened. They then called the

19:34.713 --> 19:38.837
University of Virginia and found that they had 
never heard of this man who claimed to have a degree

19:39.222 --> 19:42.691
from that school. Now you became a legend yourself 
Haskell in that role because everyone

19:43.834 --> 19:52.455
appreciated Your candor and the way you handled 
candidates who were being interviewed. Thank

19:58.712 --> 19:59.132
you. And it was. Thank you. You really became a 
legend. People just admired that and respected

20:02.796 --> 20:05.940
it. We're thankful to you for doing what you were 
doing. All right, let's go near the... As Hubert

20:09.444 --> 20:15.371
begins to reach... No, no, he didn't retire. He 
moved upstairs. All right, as he goes up to be the

20:16.852 --> 20:20.957
chancellor of the system... What did you and your 
colleagues think about the Dean of Education

20:21.781 --> 20:28.889
ascending that far up? Of course, we were very 
positive. We liked that. But the day that

20:34.075 --> 20:45.207
happened, and Frank Hubert talked to me later, and 
he can clarify this for you, but There was a

20:46.064 --> 20:54.612
committee meeting to be held like 9 o'clock that 
morning in his office, the dean's conference

20:46.064 --> 20:54.612
room. And we were all assembled up there. It may 
have been a department heads meeting, for all I

20:58.936 --> 21:01.638
know. We're all assembled up there. And Frank 
Hubert, who is very prompt, wasn't there. And all

21:09.305 --> 21:12.268
of a sudden, Peggy Ritchie, his secretary, comes 
in. She says, Dr. Johnson? Dean Hubert said,

21:15.494 --> 21:21.221
you're in charge of this meeting. OK. So I took 
charge of the meeting. And then later, probably

21:24.846 --> 21:35.980
that same day, the word trickled out that Frank 
Hubert was going to become chancellor of the

21:24.846 --> 21:35.980
system. And probably that same day, maybe, he 
talked to me. And this was the story, I think, as I

21:40.992 --> 21:45.757
best recall it. They were looking for a new 
chancellor. And occasionally, they would call

21:50.042 --> 22:00.293
Frank in and ask him for advice on how to go about 
this. Did he have anyone in mind? What did he think

22:04.517 --> 22:08.181
about person X or person Y? And apparently, this 
had gone on a couple of times. And this particular

22:12.603 --> 22:19.251
morning, he got a phone call from the chair of the 
Board of Regents. And it went something like,

22:20.313 --> 22:24.939
Frank, can you join us for breakfast at 7 o'clock? 
And Frank said, yes. And he went into that meeting

22:26.621 --> 22:32.208
thinking, oh, they've got somebody they want to 
ask me about. And they said, Frank, we want you to be

22:32.228 --> 22:37.915
the chancellor. And as I recall, he said, can I have 
a couple of hours? I need to think about this. I need

22:47.247 --> 22:47.988
to get home. Talk to Mary Julia, etc. And that's 
probably when he called over and told Peggy, you

22:51.492 --> 22:58.261
know, tell Glenn to take charge of that committee 
meeting. And he went home and talked it over and

22:59.382 --> 23:06.971
came back and accepted and became the chancellor. 
And as he had done so many times remember I told you

23:09.316 --> 23:29.923
earlier that thing I liked about Frank Hubert as I 
did seem to see with Benson they delegated and and

23:09.316 --> 23:29.923
almost immediately you know Frank Hubert was 
saying okay you guys take over now the college I'm

23:09.316 --> 23:29.923
going to be the chancellor And I'm going to do this 
thing up here kind of thing. And you can kind of

23:35.484 --> 23:39.007
review that with Frank. But that's my 
recollection that he was completely taken aback

23:39.027 --> 23:47.175
and caught completely off guard and surprised. 
Who then took over the college even on an interim

23:47.195 --> 23:53.000
basis? Oh, boy. Let's see. Was it Phil? I think it 
may have been Phil Limbacher. who was the

23:58.979 --> 24:21.156
assistant dean assistant dean and i think he 
became interim dean and served in that role until

23:58.979 --> 24:21.156
we brought corrigan in right now i chaired that 
search committee wonderful job again you see you

23:58.979 --> 24:21.156
did something now maybe you learned this from 
frank hubert for all i know or benson or some of

23:58.979 --> 24:21.156
these people But you made it very clear to us that we 
were the ones who were going to carry the ball on

24:21.777 --> 24:40.159
this and find out everything we could about these 
candidates and that we would be really the ones who

24:21.777 --> 24:40.159
would make the recommendation and you would take 
that forward. You said you might have to go forward

24:40.900 --> 24:48.068
with two or three and prioritize them, but we were 
going to carry the ball on that. And I think as a

24:49.130 --> 24:51.092
result of that, we ended up with a really fine dean 
and Dean Corrigan because I think in the past there

24:52.237 --> 25:18.733
had been times when it hadn't been handled that way 
and new deans came in and they weren't that

24:52.237 --> 25:18.733
successful as Corrigan was but I know in 
Corrigan's case he was up against some pretty

24:52.237 --> 25:18.733
stiff competition uh we had four candidates that 
we brought in One was president of the

25:19.760 --> 25:30.752
International Reading Association with a fine 
credentials out of Indiana University, as I

25:19.760 --> 25:30.752
recall, or Illinois, one of the two, probably 
Illinois. The dean of education at Ohio State

25:32.534 --> 25:35.778
University. The vice president for Stony Brook 
and the New York system. And Corrigan, dean at the

25:44.067 --> 25:46.870
University of Maryland. When I went through their 
credentials, I ranked, ordered them, number one,

25:50.438 --> 26:04.857
Dean at Ohio State, number two, Vice President 
Stony Brook, number three, Corrigan Dean at

25:50.438 --> 26:04.857
Maryland, and fourth, President of the 
International Reading Association. By the time

26:04.877 --> 26:17.914
we finished interviewing those four, there was no 
doubt in my mind and in most of the committee

26:04.877 --> 26:17.914
members that one person was a full cut above. the 
other three, and that was Dean Corrigan. And so we

26:21.610 --> 26:25.761
put our faith in him and said we want him. There was a 
play. out of some of the representatives from

26:29.318 --> 26:41.312
health and physical education for the vice 
president from Stony Brook because he had, I

26:29.318 --> 26:41.312
believe it was an undergraduate degree in health 
and physical education. So they kept pushing,

26:41.332 --> 26:48.121
Miller I believe was his name, they kept pushing 
Miller for that job. But the overwhelming number

26:48.181 --> 26:57.672
of us, as I recall, when you started counting hands 
when they went up, it was just overwhelmingly

26:48.181 --> 26:57.672
Corrigan. among things that i tried to do in that 
and other searches was that each of the candidates

26:57.652 --> 27:21.516
would go through exactly the same schedule 
hopefully in the same order in the same places with

26:57.652 --> 27:21.516
the same people present and that the interviewing 
groups would try to compose and agree upon the

27:22.154 --> 27:31.711
questions they were going to emphasize well in 
advance so that they would be pretty well

27:22.154 --> 27:31.711
measuring them the same way. And with Corrigan, I 
particularly remember picking him up at the

27:33.474 --> 27:46.457
airport about two hours after I had come back from 
my first interview visit to the University of

27:33.474 --> 27:46.457
Texas at El Paso as a potential president. And I was 
worn out physically and emotionally. And I took

27:52.009 --> 27:54.613
him to meet with the entire faculty. And when I sat 
down, I thought, boy, Mr. Visitor, you better be

27:59.680 --> 28:02.203
pretty good or I'll probably go to sleep. Well, of 
course, by the end of an hour or two of him, I was wide

28:02.864 --> 28:06.910
awake. and much impressed with him. But I felt very 
optimistic at the start, and thank goodness that

28:11.330 --> 28:19.440
optimism was fulfilled. What were his key 
attributes? Well, I think personality was

28:24.287 --> 28:28.832
overwhelmingly the key factor. He knew how to 
relate to people. He was very empathetic.

28:34.413 --> 28:49.195
understood education and the College of 
Education, had been extremely active on the

28:34.413 --> 28:49.195
national scene, was president of one of the major 
organizations in education. Striking contrast

28:50.537 --> 29:01.753
with Frank Hubert, as far as administrative style 
goes, where Frank was more of a organization

29:01.919 --> 29:28.686
delegate hold responsible type of thing Corrigan 
was more of let's be friends and let's talk about

29:01.919 --> 29:28.686
this and is there something I can do you know to move 
this along etc etc and I think just as Rudder was the

29:01.919 --> 29:28.686
right man for president of the University and then 
Jack Kenny Williams in that order and as we

29:01.919 --> 29:28.686
mentioned earlier Probably wouldn't have worked 
if it had been reversed. So it was, I think, in the

29:33.043 --> 29:36.468
case of Hubert and Corrigan. I'm not sure that the 
Corrigan deanship would have been the right one

29:37.549 --> 29:44.739
when we got started, but Hubert was. But I'm not 
sure that Hubert would have been the right one

29:45.640 --> 29:51.669
after the establishment of the college. Could 
have been. But Corrigan was the right one to follow

29:53.067 --> 30:04.602
Hubert and bring this personal touch and support 
throughout the college. Now, Corrigan would

30:04.903 --> 30:07.065
serve for? Ten years. Ten years. Okay, so he and 
Hubert then both a long time. As far as you could

30:15.897 --> 30:22.686
generalize, when Corrigan began his deanship, At 
what level was our College of Education in

30:23.459 --> 30:34.697
national or local or regional competition, and 
where was it when he stepped away? I would say when

30:35.258 --> 30:45.113
we opened our doors and after the first year or two, 
we were probably in the bottom 20%, 25%

30:35.258 --> 30:45.113
nationally.

30:46.055 --> 30:54.813
And I would say by the time Hubert finished his 
tenure and then Corrigan finished his tenure, we

30:46.055 --> 30:54.813
had moved up to the top 25%. We're not a top 10. We're 
not top 20. But at least to me.
