WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:13.033
You

00:01.634 --> 00:13.033
want me to tell you who the people are? Well, this is 
William H. Minkert. And he came from St. Louis,

00:18.162 --> 00:20.345
Missouri. And he was born in 1836 in St. Louis, 
Missouri. And what did he do there? Well, he lost

00:26.452 --> 00:31.177
both of his parents when he was real young. And the 
story that I remember from it was that his father

00:31.397 --> 00:40.746
had some kind of store, some shop, merchandise 
there. And when his father died, I don't know

00:41.527 --> 00:48.874
whether he didn't like his guardian or whoever it 
was, he just ran away. And he was real young when he

00:49.855 --> 00:51.417
ran away. I think early teens. And I think that he, 
this is my belief, that I remember Daddy saying, is

00:54.183 --> 01:02.417
this too, am I talking too loud? That's fine, 
that's fine. That he came down the Mississippi, I

01:03.219 --> 01:14.318
think, river or along it, and he painted scenery 
and curtains and all kind of things. things for

01:15.310 --> 01:17.573
opera houses and theaters. Yes, it was a traveling 
show. He did that. That's how he earned his way. On

01:23.321 --> 01:24.963
the Mississippi River, the boats too. I thought he 
was coming down and maybe he'd stop at different

01:24.983 --> 01:28.448
cities. Because back then, the rivers were the 
main form of transportation for industry and

01:29.069 --> 01:35.698
everything. Most of the settlements stemmed 
away, branched off. Daddy's dead, and I wanted a

01:39.745 --> 01:42.469
tape recorder when he was living. I wanted to get 
all this. Yes, my grandfather does the same thing.

01:47.377 --> 01:53.728
He's deceased now, but we got some real, real tapes 
my mom got from him. It's one Christmas Eve they

01:54.369 --> 01:58.075
spent, and it's really nice. He was a poet. He was a 
minister, and he used to write poetry, and every

02:02.468 --> 02:07.035
Christmas he'd send us poems. Oh, well, isn't that 
wonderful? And did he meet this girl? Well, he

02:13.243 --> 02:21.615
came, and he was in Texas about five or six years, I 
think, or something like that, when the Civil War

02:13.243 --> 02:21.615
broke out. And I've written it down on these, and 
you can have those if you want them to be verified.

02:27.986 --> 02:30.449
If you don't want them, well, you know, go buy them. 
But anyway, in February of 1961, Texas, he ceded

02:30.469 --> 02:36.778
from the union. And he'd been here long enough that 
he used loyalties for the Texas. So he entered the

02:41.104 --> 02:47.512
Civil War in September, or August. It was August 
the 5th he went to the Civil War. Let's see. He met

02:54.843 --> 02:57.768
her then in Mississippi during the war. Oh, yeah. 
And so my sister has letters that he wrote. He wrote

03:02.736 --> 03:10.608
very beautiful handwriting, and he told her, you 
know, that he wanted to marry her and that he'd come

03:02.736 --> 03:10.608
get her. And we don't know how they got here, 
whether they came by train or, you know, that's

03:10.628 --> 03:15.536
what we'd like to know. That's not in the letters. 
Yeah, well, if... Or what? Well, it could have

03:20.168 --> 03:22.110
been. We think they probably came by stagecoach. 
Yeah, that's a real good possibility. Probably

03:29.759 --> 03:37.227
did because back then if they did come by boat down 
the Gulf, down the coast, Texas coast, I think that

03:29.759 --> 03:37.227
was rather expensive. Yeah. Well, anyway, he told 
her that if she would marry him, oh, they wrote each

03:37.667 --> 03:42.913
other. They married in 1867. They had a long 
courtship. And he told her that if she would marry

03:50.020 --> 03:56.607
him, that he would take her little sister. Her 
father had died, and he said he would accept her

03:56.687 --> 04:01.391
little sister as his own sister. So her sister 
came, and her mother came. I don't know exactly

04:04.875 --> 04:07.678
when they came, but he did do that. And the sister 
then married a man who lived in Greenville. So they

04:14.304 --> 04:16.146
came, yeah. Let's see what else you'd like to know 
about him. Did you happen to know what he did after

04:20.517 --> 04:22.581
he'd gotten married? Yes. Oh, he was a carpenter 
and a builder and like a, what do you call it,

04:23.823 --> 04:30.154
cabinet maker? Yes. But the main thing he did was he 
had a paint shop, and he painted the buggies. And my

04:38.949 --> 04:41.273
daddy always said that... Grandfather Minkert 
could paint buggies. To be a buggy painter, you had

04:43.751 --> 04:50.378
to be the best of anything because people didn't 
want any lines ruined. And you had to be a liner to

04:50.499 --> 04:53.241
paint a buggy. You had to be perfect. You couldn't 
make one mistake. And Daddy did some of that. He

04:58.407 --> 05:00.429
helped his daddy with it. And he did that. And then 
he, let's see, the courthouse before this one, and

05:02.731 --> 05:08.998
I've got it written in there, He painted all the 
signs over the doors. You know, they had glass

05:12.767 --> 05:14.409
transoms. And he painted that, and one of my 
sisters has one of those when they tore it down. I

05:18.115 --> 05:21.659
was over in Pakistan, so I didn't get one of them. 
But his name was underneath the lettering, like

05:21.679 --> 05:26.406
whichever official it was. So he did that, and my 
sister said he built the first house that was ever

05:27.287 --> 05:33.275
built in Brian. Oh, do you know whereabouts it was? 
Was it right near here, or...? It's on Tabor. Tabor

05:42.665 --> 05:43.406
Road, yes. Tabor and 25th Street. It's a corner of 
Tabor and 25th Street. Do you know where the

05:48.813 --> 05:50.455
telephone office is? I don't know the streets, but 
I know where Tabor and 25th Street are. Do you know

05:55.982 --> 05:58.505
where the telephone office is across from the 
courthouse? Yes, yes. Well, this is at the

05:59.727 --> 06:04.633
opposite end where the telephone office is. 
That's where that first house was. And the first

06:07.062 --> 06:10.485
building, I guess it was a commercial building. 
Well, at the time, I remember a building. It was a

06:12.968 --> 06:16.411
huge, rambling building. This was built after 
that. And it was a bakery. When you'd go in, the bell

06:19.254 --> 06:22.397
would ring, you know. It was real cute. And they had 
this wonderful smelling bread. And Mother would

06:26.141 --> 06:28.743
send us to the bakery to get bread. Well, my father 
also had a law office right there where the

06:29.204 --> 06:35.550
telephone office is now. in the middle of that 
block. The telephone company's office was right

06:37.275 --> 06:46.828
there on the corner toward the courthouse, and 
Dad's office was right next to it. And then I've

06:47.489 --> 06:56.681
forgotten what was next to that, but I can't 
remember when the streets were paved, but there

06:47.489 --> 06:56.681
was a long time when we used a few. You know, it 
wasn't too much paving even when I was in the

06:57.723 --> 07:03.531
sidewalks. Well, how many... children that 
Finney did this man have? W.H. Mitchell, he had

07:10.808 --> 07:16.154
five children that lived. And here they are. And I 
don't know that you'll want me to give their names,

07:17.856 --> 07:21.760
but this was my father. And they had seven 
children, but five of them lived. Two died in

07:27.747 --> 07:29.108
infancy. What do you know? Why is this stuff? Many 
children died in infancy. Yes, that's right. With

07:38.185 --> 07:40.208
the measles or something like that. They didn't 
have the technology. And they'd have something

07:42.610 --> 07:44.593
they wouldn't even know. Why? I don't know. I never 
did anything. They just died in infancy. But, you

07:49.239 --> 07:53.504
know, a lot of the undeveloped countries now, half 
of their children die. I don't mean to be laughing

07:53.924 --> 07:55.286
at you. Yeah, I like to say it's true. The mortality 
rate is very high. Yeah. So... Let's see what else

08:02.690 --> 08:04.313
he did now. It's a book. It's underlined in red. 
Uh-huh. Then, okay, Jesse Gardner Minkert was...

08:10.265 --> 08:14.292
Was my father. Was your father. And William Scott 
and Charles Aschel. Ashel. Ashel and Mary Hedman

08:19.681 --> 08:22.484
and Oscar. Oscar, all lived. They all lived. I 
didn't give the names of those. We have their

08:25.808 --> 08:29.052
graves out there in the Bryan Cemetery. They all 
stayed in the Bryan area? No, Daddy's the only one

08:30.975 --> 08:32.897
that stayed here. What kind of, I don't guess you 
know why they left or anything. Well, this one died

08:39.465 --> 08:45.132
as a young man, and he had something like William 
Scott died. He had a grocery store in Greenville, I

08:45.152 --> 08:47.715
believe it was. And he had something like, say, 
you'd say cholera. It wasn't cholera, but some

08:51.018 --> 08:54.763
epidemic was going on. Yes. And he died in his early 
20s. They had cholera epidemics. They had three

09:03.134 --> 09:04.015
different ones. That wasn't what it was. It was 
something like pneumonia or something. I don't

09:09.222 --> 09:09.763
remember. I know what it is. My teacher's going to 
kill me for this because I can't remember right

09:11.566 --> 09:13.989
now. We just did a big... a big deal on the area. We 
did a field trip a couple of weekends ago, and we

09:17.394 --> 09:23.263
traveled through the Brazos Valley. Well, he died 
in about 1889, I guess, or 1890, because he was in

09:23.283 --> 09:31.376
his 20s, and Daddy said he had a grocery store. And 
what about Charles, ain't you? I think he was a

09:34.220 --> 09:37.986
carpenter, and he moved around. He did come back to 
Brian when he was older. He came back and lived with

09:41.036 --> 09:42.959
us. And Mary Edna married a man and she was a teacher 
and she married a man and went to Corpus Christi and

09:43.039 --> 09:50.748
lived to be real old. And Oscar went to Greenville 
and was a prayer nurse. A prayer nurse. So everyone

09:57.817 --> 10:01.982
was kind of a... towards the handicrafts, you 
know, such as... Well, some. She taught, and Daddy

10:06.476 --> 10:11.665
was a lawyer, and they used to rely to that. Well, 
Mrs. Fletcher said that your dad was a judge. Well,

10:14.952 --> 10:25.692
he was county attorney twice, I believe, and he was 
county surveyor twice, I believe, and county

10:14.952 --> 10:25.692
judge. And I don't know how long he was county 
judge. But in general, he just was a practicing

10:28.464 --> 10:32.751
attorney.

10:35.956 --> 10:38.439
Did surveying around here, a lot of the surveying. 
He studied law under his uncle? His uncle was the

10:45.470 --> 10:50.397
man, his uncle was Judge Montrose, and he was the 
man that this sister that my grandfather said he

10:52.098 --> 11:05.352
would take care of, she took each of his children 
into her home at some time to pay him back for caring

10:52.098 --> 11:05.352
for her. And so she had my father there, and he 
studied law under this husband of hers. And Edna

11:13.380 --> 11:16.183
lived with her a while, too.

11:19.347 --> 11:20.788
I think some others did, too. But anyway, they must 
have been a close family. And Jesse was admitted to

11:26.303 --> 11:29.708
the Texas Bar at 18-6. At the age of 22, that's... He 
was real young at the time. I think he was one of the

11:33.693 --> 11:39.962
youngest that was ever admitted for something 
somebody said. I have here his...

11:45.730 --> 11:46.711
Here's his write-up. If there's any reason you 
need it to... In writing this up, I don't know

11:51.920 --> 12:00.892
whether you'll care about it or not, when he died, 
they put that in the bar journal about him, you

11:51.920 --> 12:00.892
know, his career.

12:01.713 --> 12:05.217
And here is his, I found this just recently. You 
know, I was gone and things got thrown away. We had

12:08.482 --> 12:10.925
books, and I think I found this in an old book. 
Supreme Court, State of Texas. He was... license

12:16.439 --> 12:18.842
to practice on May 29, 1903. Wow. And

12:20.023 --> 12:26.650
we had this Brian Centennial in 1962. Now, Hugh, I 
don't know how deep you're going into this,

12:26.670 --> 12:33.138
whether you're just writing something 
superficial or not. But is this just for a theme, or

12:33.758 --> 12:38.324
what is it here? Well, we're going to eventually 
arrow every student in all the sections. and turn

12:43.608 --> 12:55.126
in their papers, and she's going to kind of get 
together, you know, I guess a book of the history of

12:43.608 --> 12:55.126
Bryan College Station. Here was in the centennial 
in 1962. That's right up there. Some of the early

13:01.275 --> 13:03.979
ones were written up at that time. Oh, yeah. You can 
take that if you want to. Some of it may duplicate.

13:08.679 --> 13:11.043
If you don't want to do it, it's all right. And this 
gives Daddy's. It says here, and I didn't realize

13:13.367 --> 13:14.990
that. I was overseas when Daddy died. It said he was 
reportedly the oldest living native resident,

13:17.094 --> 13:24.967
the oldest barn resident. And where did that? He 
lived here. We lived here always. Except I've

13:32.001 --> 13:33.684
moved off and come back. Did he live, I mean... Oh, 
what house did he live in? Was it near here? Oh, I've

13:39.173 --> 13:41.016
got a picture in here. Oh, that's where we lived 
when I was born. It was on 29th

13:44.282 --> 13:53.697
and Parker, I believe is the name of that street. 
This is our family. So the center of the city has...

13:57.956 --> 13:58.617
It changed. This house is where I was born. I've 
been trying to just... Just lately, I'm just

14:01.360 --> 14:05.944
sticking these pictures in here and I want to come 
up. And this house has been torn down. I went over to

14:08.267 --> 14:11.029
show somebody the house and they were tearing it 
down. And it's on the corner across the street from

14:11.650 --> 14:18.997
St. Anthony Catholic Church and it's on 29th 
Street. 208 29th Street was where it was. then as

14:23.677 --> 14:31.308
Daddy and Mother lived in this house at the time 
Mother died and Daddy died. That's their home.

14:32.590 --> 14:33.792
It's over on the east side. And that's on 24th 
Street. What was the main type of work that was

14:38.719 --> 14:47.913
common in Bryan at that time? Was it a lot of 
farming? I think it was mostly farming. I know

14:53.461 --> 14:58.887
cotton was pretty prevalent in the Branson Valley 
area. Yeah, well, if you're studying that, you

14:58.928 --> 15:03.893
might know more about that than I do. I was just 
curious. They had their different stores, you

15:05.876 --> 15:11.723
know, the merchants. They had the bars and the 
restaurants. They had the restaurants. The main

15:20.663 --> 15:27.990
road of travel used to be on, you know, not Texas, 
but Collins. Oh, yes. Until they built Highway 6,

15:29.151 --> 15:31.093
right? I asked my sister today, I said, now, my 
first memory of the population of Bryan was I

15:31.313 --> 15:48.088
heard, the first time I remember anybody saying 
how many people lived in Bryan, and I don't

15:31.313 --> 15:48.088
remember what year that was, but they said, Bryan 
is getting so big, it has 8,000 people in it, And

15:48.524 --> 15:53.151
that number stuck with me because I thought, oh, 
that's many people. And I said, now, what is the

15:53.912 --> 15:58.238
first time you've heard of the population? And she 
said, well, somebody said that Ron had 2,500

15:58.278 --> 16:02.624
people. And they says, oh, you're bragging. So she 
remembers. She's eight years older than I am.

16:11.609 --> 16:20.579
If you think about 8,000 people and everybody had a 
family of three to five or ten children, everybody

16:11.609 --> 16:20.579
had a big family that we knew. And there would be 
five in the family anyway with a father and mother.

16:24.664 --> 16:32.513
Well, that made about 4,000 families and you just 
about knew everybody even when I was growing up.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.275
You knew almost everybody in town. You knew the 
families. You heard of them or you knew them. So you

16:39.958 --> 16:42.842
pretty well knew what was going on all the time. 
Yeah.

16:46.227 --> 16:51.414
That's really interesting.

16:52.335 --> 16:59.465
Do you remember anything about the flooding of the 
Brazos River back then or anything like that?

16:59.485 --> 17:02.710
Mother, I was born in the middle of a flood. And I 
wasn't born in the middle of the flood. I was born

17:04.908 --> 17:06.710
during the flood of 1913. Have you all studied that 
flood of 1913? Yes, we have. Well, Mother has

17:10.113 --> 17:30.553
written down somewhere that I was born during that 
flood, and she always told me that, and said it was a

17:10.113 --> 17:30.553
terrible storm and everything, and there was a 
girl my age that was born, Mary Cavett was born

17:10.113 --> 17:30.553
during the time, and her father was in the flood, 
and from exposure he died. And so she never did know

17:30.955 --> 17:32.717
her father. And I remember there weren't too many 
cases like that, you know, and I always thought how

17:32.737 --> 17:38.926
terrible that was.

17:42.711 --> 17:46.896
Was there a lot of blacks in the area back then, in 
the Bryan Constitution area? Oh, yes. I was just

17:48.939 --> 17:54.887
talking to these other people in our class, and 
they said they interviewed some people, and they

17:48.939 --> 17:54.887
mentioned something about how Certain times of 
the day, the white people didn't even walk around

17:55.525 --> 18:05.699
the Brian Cox station outside because that was 
when all the black people came into town and all

17:55.525 --> 18:05.699
this other stuff. Did you know that? It was a lot 
safer to walk in than it is now, to be sure. Yeah. But

18:12.829 --> 18:23.825
I think my sister told me this morning, she said 
down at a certain part in Main Street, down that

18:12.829 --> 18:23.825
lower part, she said they did come to town on 
Saturday. Now, that agrees with what you said. And

18:25.613 --> 18:29.199
she said, nobody would go out down that part of 
town. And I've forgotten on Saturdays, I do

18:30.121 --> 18:34.187
remember how full town would get. Everybody would 
come to town. And that hasn't been, within about 20

18:36.952 --> 18:42.862
years, they stopped doing that on Saturdays. That 
was a big day. Was there a, I know the railroad goes

18:44.464 --> 18:47.790
through Brine, did a... Do you remember, or your 
parents or anybody ever saying about how it used to

18:48.327 --> 18:56.782
be before the railroad and after the railroad or 
the effects or anything like that? No, I didn't

18:56.802 --> 18:58.586
hear anything about that. Because, you know, a lot 
of towns back then, their existence depended on,

18:58.606 --> 19:05.478
you know, where the railroad went. Oh, yes, that's 
right. Well, of course, the railroad was... Brian

19:10.315 --> 19:18.692
took the, let it stop here, and that's why Brian 
grew another, you've heard that, you've read that

19:10.315 --> 19:18.692
too, that's why Brian, instead of Millicent, 
became a big team. Right, right. Yeah. And then my

19:20.435 --> 19:28.712
other grandparents who came in 1893, my mother's 
parents, came by railroad, and... Their older son

19:29.013 --> 19:37.309
had come to this community, or close to this 
community, and he liked Texas and had been here

19:29.013 --> 19:37.309
several years. Who's this now? My mother's. Your 
mother's son. They came in 1893, which isn't too

19:40.315 --> 19:43.180
recently. And mother, my grandfather, 
McClellan, my father's father-in-law, decided

19:50.410 --> 19:52.111
to bring his whole family. So they came, they sold 
everything. What drew them to the area? Well,

19:55.935 --> 19:58.377
their son had come over here and bought a farm. And 
he evidently convinced them to come to Texas, too.

20:02.600 --> 20:03.481
Now, this is something. He had nine children. He 
had one daughter who was married, and she and her

20:05.443 --> 20:11.568
husband came with them. Or at least if they didn't 
come in, they came right afterwards. But he

20:14.731 --> 20:19.995
brought all these children, and the mother was 13, 
and she said that she was really afraid because

20:20.195 --> 20:23.920
she'd heard how wild the Texans were. You know, 
they're still telling that on us. And she said that

20:26.323 --> 20:33.072
she'd come through, people would come through 
looking just wild on the train and they'd say,

20:26.323 --> 20:33.072
that's a Texan. And I'd say, be careful because 
that's a Texan. And so Mother said she really was

20:35.776 --> 20:42.164
afraid and said she got here and of course married 
one of them. Well, did they send their son to do them

20:42.184 --> 20:45.549
out here? Yes, uh-huh. Well, you know, What had 
they done back east? Well, my grandfather was a

20:51.080 --> 20:52.716
preacher. He was a preacher. I guess preachers 
could move around better than other people. What

20:58.430 --> 21:00.332
was the basic religion? Was there any one major 
religion? I don't know. I think we've had almost

21:04.677 --> 21:09.163
all of them. He was a Baptist. Both of my parents 
were Baptists. There were a good many Baptists.

21:19.983 --> 21:23.348
Grandfather McClung and his wife brought their 
organ with them. Maybe it was because he was a

21:23.388 --> 21:25.972
preacher they did that. But they brought that. And 
my sister said that they ate off of the box that

21:28.215 --> 21:37.549
crated the organ until they could make them a 
table. Was wood very hard? No, I don't guess wood

21:39.151 --> 21:40.433
was very hard to come by. No, there was plenty of 
wood. I heard that there used to be a lot of cedar

21:41.675 --> 21:46.462
around this area. Did you ever hear of that? Yeah. 
Oh, there was a lot. Even until, you know, recent

21:49.075 --> 21:52.081
years. It sure was.

21:57.672 --> 22:02.341
And all this, see this house, where this house is, 
was a pasture when I was a girl. All this area over

22:02.602 --> 22:06.710
here with fields and pastures. And I was thinking 
the other day, you know, after you told me, You

22:09.545 --> 22:10.846
think about things that happened. Of course, what 
I'm saying isn't anything that far back. But it

22:14.030 --> 22:18.555
would say it'd be 50 years ago, which is pretty far 
back. That I would remember. And I remember all

22:20.157 --> 22:21.458
these. There wasn't any such thing as a postage 
sign, you know. And people didn't care if you

22:25.863 --> 22:29.908
wandered around in their pastures. And kids just 
roamed around and had a good time. And we'd ask

22:33.352 --> 22:36.776
people if we could have their grapes or their 
dewberries. We'd go in big groups, you know. And it

22:39.211 --> 22:42.334
was wonderful. It was pretty rural when we, you 
know, for a long time. Did Bryan expand this way?

22:49.602 --> 22:50.103
Oh, yeah. Or instead of not that way, but towards 
College Station area? No, first it expanded east

22:53.226 --> 22:56.750
and then toward College. When did they first 
really start recognizing College Station as a

22:57.250 --> 23:04.138
separate little town? Was it very noticeable back 
then? Oh, it was always a separate town since I can

23:06.300 --> 23:09.083
remember. Did it basically center around A&M like 
it does now? No, I don't think so. There were always

23:17.833 --> 23:24.240
people from A&M that came to church in Brownville. 
There have always been communication and

23:24.320 --> 23:32.309
friendships between them. Some people like to act 
like there's a You know, there's competition and

23:35.000 --> 23:40.689
all that, but there's always been as many 
friendships as there were competition. Oh, just

23:41.690 --> 23:43.353
checking the tape here. Let's see. Is there 
anything you want to ask me? Oh, just, you know,

23:51.526 --> 24:02.543
just basically, you know, just things about the 
area, you know, that happened, that might have

23:51.526 --> 24:02.543
happened to you, you know, while you were growing 
up, anything that really... stands out in your

24:03.451 --> 24:06.274
mind. Well, this is within recent years, but do you 
want mostly those things back there during my

24:07.135 --> 24:14.624
grandfather's day? Is that what you want? Is that 
what you're trying to get, those things? I'm

24:19.489 --> 24:21.191
trying to get just about everything I can. What do 
you know about it? Well, Bryan was the place that

24:22.553 --> 24:27.539
the Hoods Brigade met. You've probably heard that 
before. They met here. had their reunions here.

24:33.012 --> 24:41.483
I've forgotten what, I've got the book on that, for 
quite a few years and this was the big event in Ryan.

24:42.204 --> 24:47.651
Nothing could match that for, it was just gala, you 
know. We just, for about three or four days, they

24:47.872 --> 24:59.867
just put it, rolled out the red carpet and these old 
veterans came and they closed the, you know, even

24:47.872 --> 24:59.867
that block on Texas Avenue where the courthouse 
is, they'd close that and close all around some,

25:00.438 --> 25:04.584
maybe two blocks. And they'd have speeches and 
singing and dancing and entertain these little

25:05.265 --> 25:14.418
old men that just barely could make it, you know? So 
there's a man that has written a book just recently

25:15.660 --> 25:27.176
about the reunion of the Hoods Brigade, and he came 
to Brian and asked us to tell anything we could

25:15.660 --> 25:27.176
remember, you know? So I said, well... I go home, I 
think I've got something in the diary. So I did, and

25:31.192 --> 25:33.835
he says, yeah, that he wanted to use that. And I 
wrote that, and as soon as I read what I had written,

25:34.535 --> 25:40.962
well, I remembered it. I said, there were two old 
slaves that came, you know, and everybody said,

25:41.102 --> 25:46.187
those are slaves. And he said, well, that was the 
first time he'd ever heard of that. Well, it may not

25:48.930 --> 25:50.391
have been slaves. It may have been that they were 
Southern soldiers, you know. Maybe that's why

25:54.996 --> 25:56.517
they didn't name them. But they came with the 
veterans. So that was interesting to me. And he

26:01.769 --> 26:04.111
said that was the first time anybody had mentioned 
that. But I know I wouldn't have said it if it hadn't

26:04.172 --> 26:09.478
been written, because I'd written it in 1933. Oh, 
yeah. Well, how often did they have these ? Every

26:15.445 --> 26:15.905
year. Once a year? And this was 1934 was the last 
year. I had written it in 1933, so he said that he was

26:22.687 --> 26:28.955
interested in that. Do you remember anything 
about the impact of any of the, you know,

26:28.995 --> 26:41.732
country-wide conflicts or anything, how the 
impact it had on the Bryan Confliction? Like, you

26:42.413 --> 26:46.998
know, World War I and stuff like that. World War I? I 
can remember the end of World War I. I was about

26:49.568 --> 26:57.544
four, let's see, I was about five. And I was the only 
one in the family that didn't get to march in the

26:58.266 --> 27:01.613
parade. And I was so humiliated because I had four 
brothers and sisters and they marched with flags

27:02.475 --> 27:10.952
in the parade. down Main Street or wherever it was. 
And I was too little, of course. Now they'd let

27:15.573 --> 27:17.937
somebody that young in. But I got to watch them 
anyway. But I remember that part of it. They said

27:22.386 --> 27:26.975
that they used to tell the joke on me that I was 
crying. They were talking about the wars they were

27:27.035 --> 27:29.941
doing for the kids and I was crying. And Mother 
said, what's the matter? And I said, well, All the

27:33.983 --> 27:41.033
boys are going to war, and then isn't going to be 
anybody left for me to marry except Daddy, and

27:33.983 --> 27:41.033
you've already married him. So you don't put that 
in there. But anyway, I do remember it. Yeah,

27:47.362 --> 27:53.891
because a lot of times I break awards and stuff. 
Like I'm from San Antonio, and before that I lived

27:54.152 --> 27:58.738
in Monterey, Mexico. And I noticed when I was 
little that Although my parents knew what was

28:01.962 --> 28:05.389
going on, political life. I was a little kid. I 
didn't know anything about it. It's really

28:09.938 --> 28:16.391
strange because... Well, we had a hard time in the 
First World War and the Second World War. There

28:17.394 --> 28:19.418
were many restrictions. You want to turn that 
over? No, that's just... There were many...

28:24.018 --> 28:26.282
Necessities, almost, that you did without. And 
even as a child, I remember that. And I remember

28:28.226 --> 28:31.471
there was somebody lived in a small house. You know 
this house in the picture I showed you? Yeah.

28:33.836 --> 28:35.759
Somebody lived in a small house back of us. And they 
sang this song. And even though I was just about

28:37.682 --> 28:40.487
four years old, I remembered it. And we'd sing that 
a long time. It said, "'Eat bologna sausage till

28:41.890 --> 28:45.857
the bacon goes down.'" That was some song, and we'd 
get tickled. So I thought that was funny. And

28:52.575 --> 28:55.958
everybody had a hard time financially. Yeah. What 
about the Depression hit you pretty good, too?

28:59.682 --> 28:59.942
Here? Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, terrible. Because I know 
back then, it was basically, was it still a farming

29:02.605 --> 29:06.569
community back then? Were your parents in Mexico 
then? No, they just been there since 1950.

29:16.280 --> 29:21.186
But, you know, this was basically a farming 
community back then, wasn't it? World War II,

29:21.246 --> 29:24.210
World War II. So I guess it hit pretty hard. Yeah, 
there were many, a lot of rationing and

29:25.472 --> 29:30.438
everything. You've probably heard about that. Do 
you remember the first time they ever paved the

29:33.121 --> 29:36.906
streets in Brine? I noticed it back then. Back, you 
know, whenever it rained, you know, a lot of cities

29:38.808 --> 29:42.753
were always in the mud. I do remember as they paved a 
little at a time, you know, a little at a time. And

29:46.557 --> 29:48.380
this Haswell Drive was... I graduated from high 
school in 1931, and Haswell Drive, part of it, just

29:49.621 --> 29:57.951
part of it has been paved since we bought this 
house. But the park that I went to walk to school on

29:58.031 --> 30:06.802
was paved in 1931, if I remember right, about the 
time because it was so muddy. And we... walked to

30:09.335 --> 30:11.759
school in mud all the time. Didn't think about it. 
Nobody rode to school. That was more fun than

30:15.585 --> 30:21.375
riding because the whole neighborhood went like 
20 or 25 together. You just pick up another family,

30:21.395 --> 30:23.979
you know, as you go along. That was the most fun. I 
thought the children miss a lot because we had so

30:25.382 --> 30:33.435
much fun visiting and, you know, talking to each 
other and getting acquainted. What was I going to

30:34.462 --> 30:36.985
say? I thought of something. About the paving. And 
I guess they'll tell you we had horse troughs, and I

30:40.328 --> 30:54.002
can't remember when they took those horse troughs 
out of Main Street, but I remember them being there

30:40.328 --> 30:54.002
at the corners. Right, yeah. I think it's about the 
end of this tape there.
