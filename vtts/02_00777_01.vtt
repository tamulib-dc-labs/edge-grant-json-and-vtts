WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:09.917
This is Deborah Beale, and I am interviewing Dr. 
Kenneth Hall, history of the Texas Engineering

00:03.170 --> 00:09.917
Experiment Station. The date is June 7, 1984.

00:15.904 --> 00:16.044
OK. I'd first like to start with his little brief 
biographical statement, education,

00:17.306 --> 00:23.332
background. Hi. Yeah. I have a bachelor's at the 
University of Tulsa, a master's at California

00:24.834 --> 00:33.143
Berkeley, a PhD in Oklahoma. We have taught at the 
University of Virginia here, a visiting prof in

00:33.747 --> 00:56.633
Belgium at the University of Lubin, and wood 
programical production research for Kempshire

00:33.747 --> 00:56.633
Corporation. And you came here in 74? Yes. And how 
did you come here? How did that happen?

01:08.092 --> 01:15.983
I've been working for several years with 
Professor Eubank in the chemical engineering

01:08.092 --> 01:15.983
department. Through the corporation? No, when I 
was at the University of Virginia. I had been

01:21.831 --> 01:26.518
working with him on some joint research 
interests. He asked if I'd come here and I said yes.

01:33.283 --> 01:34.805
And how did you get involved with TEAS? You've got 
to be involved with TEAS. You've got to do

01:39.069 --> 01:41.332
research. So you started when you came with some 
type of research with TEAS? Yeah, I brought

01:44.956 --> 01:46.397
research grants and equipment. What type of 
grants and equipment did you bring? I had an NSF

01:52.103 --> 01:57.349
grant and a PRF grant and an ATA grant.

01:59.573 --> 02:09.728
And

01:59.573 --> 02:09.728
I brought the net apparatus

01:59.573 --> 02:09.728
with me. Were they grants for thermodynamics? 
Yep. And that's what you've been involved in all

02:12.632 --> 02:17.119
this time? Yep. And how did you come about to become 
director and center

02:17.239 --> 02:23.769
now? All the same. I'm sorry. Director. Director. 
Well, that's quite a

02:29.442 --> 02:40.436
story. TRC had fallen on hard times financially. 
And it got to the point where in 1975, I believe it

02:46.423 --> 02:59.179
was, they had run into the red about

03:01.488 --> 03:05.423
I believe it was something like $250,000 in the 
Research Foundation. And the Research

03:05.443 --> 03:13.152
Foundation has no mechanism for covering that

03:05.443 --> 03:13.152
kind of entry. And so the only option was for TEAS to 
purchase DRC from the Research Foundation for

03:13.958 --> 03:22.266
$250,000 or whatever it was. So prior to 1975 it was 
part of the Research Center? Yeah, it was in the

03:25.289 --> 03:30.915
Chemistry Department and it was an organization 
under the Research Center. So there was no TEAS? No

03:31.996 --> 03:35.679
TEAS connection at all. But in 1975 TEAS purchased 
it from the Research Foundation for the amount of

03:35.699 --> 03:43.307
money it was in the red. For the next four or five 
years, TRC proceeded to lose something on the

03:43.878 --> 03:54.869
order of more than $100,000

03:43.878 --> 03:54.869
a year.

03:57.832 --> 04:08.603
In 1978, the director resigned, and I was put in 
charge of trying to find a new director. And we

04:09.612 --> 04:16.561
looked for a year for a new director and couldn't 
find anybody that was willing to come take over an

04:09.612 --> 04:16.561
organization that was losing $150,000 a year. And 
so, as I remember it, one day Fred Benson called me

04:18.223 --> 04:25.893
in and says, you've got it. Get it in the black. And 
he shoved me out the door. So that's how I became

04:30.318 --> 04:33.983
director. Sounds like the normal process. Yeah. 
Has it gotten into the black since then? Yeah, we

04:40.097 --> 04:42.340
made it to black the first year. With grants? With 
grants and reorganizing finances. Well, I took

04:47.067 --> 04:57.583
over in May, and for the year that ended in August, I 
think it lost something like $90,000. The next

04:58.845 --> 05:00.527
year we made... Something like 12,000. That's a 
pretty good turnaround. And ever since then,

05:06.112 --> 05:13.181
we've

05:06.112 --> 05:13.181
always been in the black. We've never hit a red 
deer. What is the particular, I've read lots of

05:16.225 --> 05:24.977
things, but I'd like a brief explanation of what 
the purpose of the center is. What we do is collect

05:26.900 --> 05:32.090
out of the literature thermodynamic data on 
organic compounds. And we evaluate these data and

05:33.593 --> 05:48.823
toss out the bad data and then publish the best 
critically evaluated data in the tables which are

05:33.593 --> 05:48.823
all these books over here now though. The white 
labeled ones are thermodynamic data, and the

05:49.816 --> 05:55.186
colored labeled ones are spectroscopic data. So 
we publish both kinds, although the

05:55.206 --> 06:02.980
spectroscopic data is in a white thermodynamic 
state

05:55.206 --> 06:02.980
also. We also publish several other 
compilations, but we do all

06:03.461 --> 06:12.297
paperwork over here. And it's principally the 
compilation and evaluation and publication of

06:13.627 --> 06:19.535
data. Is that what the center's been doing ever 
since it's been here? Yeah, the center's 42 years

06:23.441 --> 06:28.749
old now. It started out at NBS in Washington. It 
moved to Carnegie Mellon in about 52, I believe it

06:33.435 --> 06:37.802
was. And in 61 it came here. Was it a particular 
individual that moved it all these different

06:41.757 --> 06:45.600
places? Well, sort of. Fred Rossini started it out 
at NBS in Washington, and he moved it to Carnegie

06:47.262 --> 06:51.366
Mellon. When he left Carnegie Mellon, he was going 
to be dean at Notre Dame, and he wasn't going to have

06:52.707 --> 07:03.176
time for the center anymore, so he split the center 
into two parts. He gave one part to Dr. Swalinski,

07:04.357 --> 07:10.903
which is the part that came here, and one part to Dr. 
which went to Purdue. And the one at Purdue does

07:16.150 --> 07:23.699
transport properties and we do thermonautic 
properties.

07:23.719 --> 07:27.844
But it's been doing principally the same type of 
thing since it began. Same type of work for 47 years

07:27.864 --> 07:33.030
now, yeah. I see that when most people in the world 
think about Texas A&M, they probably think about

07:33.050 --> 07:38.477
TRC. All those little dots are where we have 
subscribers to our publications. We pretty much

07:45.970 --> 07:49.516
cover Western Europe and Japan. That's a paid 
subscription, right? Yeah. I read one of the

07:55.872 --> 08:06.834
pamphlets that Tease puts out on the Center, and 
they said that you were trying to get more research

07:55.872 --> 08:06.834
money, or research-oriented versus 
sales-oriented. Is that the sales part, the

08:06.854 --> 08:09.499
selling of subscription? On the other hand, 
that's the PR for the university. So...

08:17.675 --> 08:19.578
It's a valuable function. What I want to see happen 
over here is that we become more of an academic

08:20.219 --> 08:45.016
research organization, yes, in that the research 
personnel here would be writing research

08:20.219 --> 08:45.016
proposals, doing research projects, and we would 
also be doing the tables here, because the tables

08:20.219 --> 08:45.016
are extremely valuable for the scientific and 
technical community in the world. And this would

08:45.036 --> 08:46.618
be fallback. one guy's grants going down a year, 
why didn't they pick it up on sales? Does the

08:52.786 --> 08:55.190
National Bureau of Standards finance any of this? 
Yes.

08:59.175 --> 09:04.363
They're currently our biggest research sponsor. 
Have they been sponsoring you all along somewhat?

09:07.707 --> 09:10.952
No, they started in about

09:14.594 --> 09:22.986
It was around 75 also when they

09:14.594 --> 09:22.986
started supporting the center. Yeah, it was 75. 75 
is when API stopped supporting it. This project

09:29.616 --> 09:35.144
was originally API project 44. And it was that 
project from 1940.

09:42.387 --> 09:53.538
From about 1942 until 1966

09:42.387 --> 09:53.538
it was API Research Project 44. In 66, 44 
terminated and API continued to subsidize the

09:53.558 --> 10:03.928
project until 75 and then stopped subsidizing. 
Originally these data were all gratis.

10:12.931 --> 10:20.304
In terms of organization and administration, was 
it easier once you were in T's to cut back on money? I

10:20.664 --> 10:33.486
mean, do you think that made it easier when you 
reorganized to cut back on administrative costs?

10:33.506 --> 10:33.646
Oh, no. No? No. It didn't really make any 
difference. Have you noticed a difference in your

10:34.953 --> 10:43.343
job at all with the changes in administration, 
either at the system level, the university level,

10:34.953 --> 10:43.343
or the TEAS level? Sure. Now, who has changed 
your... Whoever it is that starts pouring out the

10:44.604 --> 10:50.871
paperwork. Is the paperwork that changes it? 
Yeah.

10:57.279 --> 10:58.260
Has there been any... change in attitude towards 
the Senate in terms of support or ignoring

10:58.932 --> 11:15.898
it? There was a big change in attitude when we got to 
black. The center is completely

11:23.047 --> 11:25.750
self-supporting. We get in $60,000 a year from 
TEAS in September and we give back $60,000 a year in

11:25.770 --> 11:35.599
August.

11:35.619 --> 11:41.025
TEAS has helped us out considerably the last two 
years because we desperately needed a computer.

11:42.026 --> 11:48.312
And so they said for the two years, which are ending 
in this August, that rather than give back the

11:48.595 --> 11:54.964
$60,000, we can just use that towards getting a 
computer. One of your own, or access to one? So, at

11:58.929 --> 12:13.590
the end of this year, we expect to break just 
exactly even, but we will have taken $120,000 in

11:58.929 --> 12:13.590
state money and computerized ourselves.

12:14.110 --> 12:21.399
However, we've got an excellent computer system 
right now, probably a better one than anybody else

12:14.110 --> 12:21.399
in the university has. We have a much more modern 
system, and we're able to do things that really no

12:21.419 --> 12:36.439
other department in the

12:21.419 --> 12:36.439
campus can do. So in your attitude, the low point of 
the center was when it was in the red. The low point

12:41.025 --> 12:43.628
of the center was when I took it over. when you were 
given the opportunity to get in the black or else.

12:49.118 --> 13:00.933
And is there a particular project besides the 
measurement in terms of research that the center

12:49.118 --> 13:00.933
has undertaken in a particular crowd? We're not 
doing the measurement. All the thermodynamic

13:03.216 --> 13:09.464
measurements, all the experimental work, we do it 
a couple of days a day. And there we have Drs.

13:10.766 --> 13:12.788
Eubank, Holstie, and myself. And Dr. Marsh, who's 
joined us as associate director here, is also

13:14.067 --> 13:21.138
doing experimental work. He does that all over 
again in our experimental department. So you're

13:26.407 --> 13:30.193
just doing collection of data here? Right. 
Compilation. Now, of course, there is research

13:31.535 --> 13:34.620
involved with that also. It's not just... It's 
verification research? No. coming up with new

13:38.603 --> 13:46.334
ways to estimate properties of molecules which 
aren't on the data and things like this. So you're

13:46.654 --> 13:49.418
not just taking what everyone else has done? No, 
you don't just take what they did and put it in the

13:49.438 --> 13:53.704
page and run it back down. So that brings me to one of 
the major questions I wanted to ask. What is the

13:57.570 --> 13:59.953
difference between this center as a center in the 
different departmental divisions of TUES, like

14:00.440 --> 14:09.093
the CHEME division of TUES?

14:12.198 --> 14:16.805
There's no academic ones. We're just like the 
Nuclear Science Center or the Center for

14:16.825 --> 14:20.110
Strategic Technology or something. There's no 
academic connections, except myself. I'm also a

14:22.153 --> 14:24.456
professor of chemical engineering. Do you employ 
graduate students at all here? Sometimes.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.323
Sometimes undergraduate students. Right now we 
have three or four undergraduates employed.

14:36.968 --> 14:40.753
Well, actually, yeah, we have one graduate 
student employed right now, too. That's all you

14:40.773 --> 14:44.198
have to do with the academics? Using some of them to 
research? Sort of. We also provide a great deal of

14:48.583 --> 14:52.488
service for the experimental group. But in terms 
of academically, that's the only contact you

14:52.508 --> 14:56.333
have? And then the academic center is more of the, 
the

14:58.034 --> 15:13.828
division is the research division that does

14:58.034 --> 15:13.828
the chemical properties research. Experimental 
work.

15:22.035 --> 15:24.898
Yeah, experimental work is done through the 
chemical engineering division. Mainly because

15:24.918 --> 15:26.539
Dr. Solstein, you might have had an opportunity at 
TRC. Well, of course it gets a little mixed up too.

15:32.046 --> 15:39.153
Is there a function you think you would like your 
center to have that it doesn't have? A function?

15:46.020 --> 15:56.070
What would be best is if we could collect all the 
thermonautics work under one mat.

16:02.311 --> 16:17.469
preferably in one location, so that we can have the 
experimental work and the theoretical work that

16:02.311 --> 16:17.469
we do here all in one location where there can be a 
lot more exchange between people. You're not

16:17.610 --> 16:19.432
talking about administratively as much as you are 
physical? No, physically. It doesn't matter

16:20.553 --> 16:31.086
whether it's under the head of chemical 
engineering or under the director of TRC, but it

16:20.553 --> 16:31.086
would just be better for everyone involved if we 
were all in one location. Has that been talked

16:32.770 --> 16:34.071
about at all? Administratively, I don't think the 
Department of Chemical Engineering wants to have

16:34.091 --> 16:40.078
anything else to do with this place. He was trying 
to ride herd on it from 75 to 79. While you were

16:44.342 --> 16:45.743
trying to find somebody? While we were trying to 
find somebody to run it, yeah. And it's, there is a

16:50.708 --> 16:56.595
considerable amount of administrative work to be 
done here. And, of course, Chem-E is even a bigger

16:56.615 --> 17:01.900
mess.

17:04.259 --> 17:08.585
You've got to have a real empire building to want to 
take this on in addition. Dr. Holland doesn't

17:08.605 --> 17:11.850
especially care for this room. Has there been any 
talk about moving them into the same physical

17:12.351 --> 17:16.437
facilities? I've talked about it for years, man. 
Every time I talk to the spacemen around here, they

17:18.821 --> 17:23.848
talk about moving them farther apart.

17:26.572 --> 17:31.279
Basically, every time we've gone to the 
university for help with space, We've worked in

17:32.609 --> 17:41.701
the opposite direction of

17:32.609 --> 17:41.701
what we should have been able to do. Do you have no 
possibilities of moving into the new center? No.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.447
We were supposed to move into the new center. What 
happened there? We were told we weren't going to

17:47.228 --> 17:55.418
move into the new center about two or three months 
before people started moving.

17:55.438 --> 17:56.199
Is there any problems? We asked to go into the old 
English annex over here. This building was

17:58.442 --> 18:00.625
falling down up on the street. Well, they decided 
if we wanted it, it must be good, so they'd keep it.

18:06.390 --> 18:06.971
Nobody's in there yet. That was two or three years 
ago now. Is that closer to the community? No. It's

18:11.999 --> 18:12.880
just a bigger space. We could have all gotten into 
one. See, we're on two different floors of this

18:14.503 --> 18:19.550
building, which causes problems. So they've got 
kind of stuck in cubby holes. Yeah. Basically, the

18:23.636 --> 18:32.029
spacemen decided that maybe somewhere around 
1990, we might be able to move into the... USDA

18:33.967 --> 18:36.009
building. That's way over on the other side of the 
campus. Yeah, it's farther away from the

18:38.993 --> 18:44.500
experimental work yet, like I said. Has the center 
involved any interdisciplinary cooperation? Or

18:48.444 --> 18:51.868
is it all chemistry? Oh, we cooperate with

18:51.888 --> 18:56.714
chemistry, too. Have you involved the Data 
Processing Center or the Computer Science Center

18:56.794 --> 19:02.261
in any computer acquisitions? No. That's who

19:03.768 --> 19:09.513
we want to get away from. We will be cutting off, 
we'll be cutting the lines of the Omdahl sometime

19:09.533 --> 19:20.844
in the next year.

19:21.385 --> 19:21.965
Just being kind of universal. And have any 
external events, state and national, created

19:21.985 --> 19:28.091
increased interest in your center? Sure. But are 
there particular ones you can think of? Yeah, the

19:32.695 --> 19:33.336
economic recovery. And

19:33.839 --> 20:00.775
something was starting before the

19:33.839 --> 20:00.775
recession, and that is an awareness that, well, 
what started before the recession was the huge

19:33.839 --> 20:00.775
increase in oil prices, of course, and the 
awareness of energy resources. To do anything

20:01.497 --> 20:09.251
with energy resources, you have to know what the 
thermodynamic properties are. Therefore, since

20:09.271 --> 20:20.350
we were doing, we're the only center in the world 
essentially doing this kind of work, putting out

20:09.271 --> 20:20.350
all the thermodynamic properties that we're 
getting to come up with. That was starting to have a

20:21.022 --> 20:23.585
big impact. Then, of course, the recession caused 
a lot of people to drop subscriptions because our

20:23.685 --> 20:32.835
costs kept going up while the recession kept going 
on. Now that the recession's about over, there's

20:34.157 --> 20:40.584
more interest in the product again. But there's 
something else that's starting to get into the

20:40.604 --> 20:50.775
wind, and that is that the chemical and petroleum 
industry is perceived as a smokestack industry,

20:40.604 --> 20:50.775
which it can't afford to be. I

20:51.734 --> 21:00.107
think that's something that's going to change 
rapidly in the next five to ten years. The

21:00.127 --> 21:06.937
particular industry is not going to be content to 
sit back

21:00.127 --> 21:06.937
in that position. It will be wanting to move much 
more into what people perceive as high-tech. Now,

21:13.335 --> 21:18.802
when you say high-tech right now, everybody 
thinks, well, you're either talking about

21:13.335 --> 21:18.802
microelectronics or genetic engineering. What 
are you talking about when you say that? I'm

21:20.345 --> 21:22.408
talking about high technology. What's the 
difference between high technology and regular

21:22.428 --> 21:25.852
technology? High technology is where you do a 
great deal of research and you utilize the

21:25.872 --> 21:40.573
benefits of that research or utilize the results 
of that research to benefit an entire program or

21:25.872 --> 21:40.573
entire industry or society as a whole. All the 
years that

21:45.171 --> 22:01.408
the people in electrical engineering, let's just 
pick as an example, were sitting there with not

21:45.171 --> 22:01.408
much to do except research, like the past 20 years. 
So they sat there and they did research and did

22:01.428 --> 22:08.355
research and they had a big spur from the military 
and from NASA. But really all they were doing was

22:08.375 --> 22:10.898
research for 20 years. them all of a sudden, boom, 
it becomes possible to take advantage of all this

22:11.958 --> 22:16.444
research. And the electronics industry just came 
roaring out of the last recession. In fact, it

22:21.050 --> 22:25.095
hardly dipped when it went into it. For the past 20 
years, the petroleum and chemical industry has

22:25.115 --> 22:34.387
primarily been interested in extracting the 
maximum possible profit out of it. I'm not saying

22:34.407 --> 22:39.514
that in the way the idiots in Washington say it. But 
it's just that They were much less concerned with

22:41.017 --> 22:53.393
doing research than they were with providing the 
goods that people wanted and getting back money

22:41.017 --> 22:53.393
from it and diversifying. They were spending the 
same time. They realized that the oil was going to

22:55.416 --> 23:04.708
start declining in abundance in the United 
States, and they were diversifying at the same

22:55.416 --> 23:04.708
time. So they were pouring profits back in, but 
they were pouring back in the diversification.

23:10.058 --> 23:13.602
But at the same time, they completely neglected 
research. They didn't completely neglect it, but

23:14.102 --> 23:19.368
on the scale of things, they completely neglected 
research for 20 years. Now all of a sudden, they're

23:20.589 --> 23:24.994
a smokestack industry, and they're having a hard 
time coming out of the recession. This is probably

23:25.014 --> 23:27.597
the largest reason. So are they providing a lot of 
funds for research yet? Nope. You think they'll

23:31.581 --> 23:32.983
move that direction? Yes.

23:36.029 --> 23:39.013
Is that one of the ways TEAS can help you? Is it 
chemical research? No, TEAS can't help at all.

23:42.458 --> 23:44.281
TEAS can't help at all? TEAS doesn't believe there 
is chemical petroleum in Texas. TEAS only

23:48.426 --> 23:52.292
believes there is microelectronics in Texas. You 
think they've become myopic?

23:57.038 --> 23:57.159
Yeah. They're overlooking the... It's a major 
value-added industry in the state. It always has

24:02.254 --> 24:06.681
been and it's very likely to continue to be for the 
next 20 to 30 years. And Matisse just doesn't seem

24:08.824 --> 24:15.855
to have any interest in assisting this particular 
industry. Has that attitude changed? No. It's

24:18.238 --> 24:18.859
grown. Ever since you've been here? Sort of a 
benign and black situation.

24:29.067 --> 24:35.757
There's a massive lack of understanding of the 
fact that this particular... Well, let's put it

24:29.067 --> 24:35.757
this way. The industry has always given the 
impression that it doesn't need anybody because

24:35.798 --> 24:41.406
it's a giant. We're sitting here with, I forget how 
many billion dollars a year it pumps into the

24:41.667 --> 24:56.610
economy of the state, but it's something like 40 to 
45% of the economy of the state comes from the

24:41.667 --> 24:56.610
chemical and petroleum industry.

25:00.083 --> 25:03.908
And you tend to think, well, they just don't need 
anything. And the industry itself gives the

25:03.988 --> 25:06.911
impression they don't need anything. Well, the 
industry is in desperate need right now, and it's

25:06.931 --> 25:12.338
slowly beginning to perceive that it needs 
something right now. I think that it should be one

25:13.379 --> 25:18.566
of the functions of TEAS to look for situations 
like this and be ready to move in. The biggest

25:20.408 --> 25:29.479
problem, I think, we've had at this university, 
not just with TEAS, but the university as a whole,

25:20.408 --> 25:29.479
is it's always running around after something. 
Instead of running out in front with something.

25:32.383 --> 25:33.184
Anticipation. Yeah, we never anticipate 
anything. We say, oh my God, genetic engineering

25:34.806 --> 25:37.070
is a big thing. Well, it started, what, five years 
ago. Oh, we better get into genetic engineering.

25:42.257 --> 25:44.400
It really looks like it's finally going 
somewhere.

25:47.305 --> 25:49.308
Texas A&M never wants to take a flyer. They always 
want to be absolutely sure that, yes, this is a

25:50.529 --> 25:55.116
profitable product. and we'll wait until we're 
absolutely sure it's a problem, then we'll go down

25:55.957 --> 26:01.811
that path, and then you miss the wave.

26:06.543 --> 26:10.152
In terms of... In your particular center, I know 
you don't think your impact is limited to just A&M

26:11.212 --> 26:19.423
or Texas. Do you think it's statewide? We have no 
impact on A&M whatsoever, but our impact

26:21.706 --> 26:26.833
worldwide is considerable. If we were to shut 
down, there would be howls and cracks around the

26:27.594 --> 26:37.928
world because they would not be able to get this 
information in. Is there anything else you'd like

26:39.359 --> 26:42.364
to tell me? Anything about the Center I haven't 
covered in questions you'd like to tell me? And

26:48.232 --> 26:52.038
it's relationship to TEAS. It's been a 
comfortable relationship with TEAS. TEAS has

26:54.462 --> 27:03.055
finally gotten comfortable with the Center since 
we don't really cost them anything.

27:09.886 --> 27:16.754
I don't think Tease yet perceives the impact the 
center has on the reputation.

27:22.080 --> 27:27.847
Do you think they have a tendency to go after the 
high gloss stuff?

27:31.391 --> 27:31.491
Yeah. Yeah, maybe a little bit more than they 
should right now.

27:42.337 --> 27:48.006
There

27:42.337 --> 27:48.006
are always flashy, sexy things roaring around. 
But like I say, if you try to jump on those

27:48.066 --> 27:54.136
bandwagons, you usually miss them. If you're the 
guy that comes out and invents the flashy, sexy

27:54.156 --> 28:04.372
thing and you go to me, you're riding the wave all 
the way

27:54.156 --> 28:04.372
in. I think T's have been trying to do that sort of 
thing. I think they've come up with some. some

28:09.455 --> 28:11.499
ideas along those lines. Unfortunately, I think 
that,

28:11.599 --> 28:21.700
in my opinion, some of them have been dissipated. 
Yes, they are trying to lead in an area, and it may be

28:21.720 --> 28:27.673
a function that T should be performing. It's not 
necessarily good in terms of anything.

28:34.818 --> 28:38.404
What's good for TEAS is not necessarily good for 
A&M. That's right. A&M University or A&M System,

28:39.065 --> 28:44.394
it's not good. A&M System. TEAS is a state agency 
and it has a broader charter than just a function

28:45.937 --> 28:54.311
for Texas A&M System.

28:54.331 --> 28:59.880
And some of the functions that they've entered 
into, I think, satisfied their charter very well,

29:00.974 --> 29:08.961
but unfortunately don't do much for Texas A&M 
System.

29:13.766 --> 29:14.867
And you say, well, so what? That's their charter. 
Well, 80% of the T's budget comes from the A&M

29:15.708 --> 29:21.473
System. It comes from people getting research 
contracts. T's state budget is something around

29:25.697 --> 29:30.441
$5 million. is what they get from the state. The 
budget they operate on is 25 to 30 million. All but

29:39.817 --> 29:48.207
the 5 million comes from Texas

29:39.817 --> 29:48.207
A&M. So it's

29:48.227 --> 29:54.555
true that they have a broader charter than to have 
just operate in the best interest of Texas A&M, but

29:54.957 --> 30:07.411
it's also true that without Texas A&M they'd be a 
mighty little burp

29:54.957 --> 30:07.411
somewhere. Is there anything else you'd

30:07.431 --> 30:21.066
like to add? I just think that, yeah, maybe. Tees 
has gotten a lot of bad press lately, I think. Well,

30:31.570 --> 30:33.252
it's always had a lot of bad press. And it isn't 
necessarily deserved. The problem is, of course,

30:36.717 --> 30:40.522
there's only a finite amount of money. And they 
have to manage it, and Tees has to manage that money

30:40.542 --> 30:51.036
in a way that the people at Tees think best and think 
would be most productive for most people. And as a

30:51.809 --> 30:59.980
result, they of course catch a lot of static from 
people that think that their particular program

30:51.809 --> 30:59.980
is the most important one in the world. Why don't 
you give me all the

31:00.000 --> 31:07.711
money? But I think overall, the TEAS has done a 
remarkably good job of supporting the functions

31:07.731 --> 31:21.310
that it deals with.

31:25.188 --> 31:41.841
I think certainly that in the School of 
Engineering,

31:25.188 --> 31:41.841
if you took a step back and looked at things, 
Teaswood has provided much better support for the

31:25.188 --> 31:41.841
School of Engineering than the University

31:25.188 --> 31:41.841
has. And I think a lot of people around the 
University tend to forget that.

31:49.302 --> 31:55.728
Because I think T's is my old professor

31:49.302 --> 31:55.728
sometimes. So they're trying to get beyond 
myopia, but they're still human? Sure. No, it's

32:04.636 --> 32:05.496
hard. It's easy to sit back and criticize 
anything. There's a lot of good stuff that goes on

32:08.239 --> 32:12.763
with T's, too. And it provides a lot of flexibility 
to do things that you couldn't do otherwise. I

32:19.812 --> 32:36.896
don't think we could have ever, well, we might have 
been able to work out a deal somehow other than

32:19.812 --> 32:36.896
purchase a computer over a period of two years, but 
it was a lot easier to do it with Deezer.

32:36.916 --> 32:38.619
And I appreciate that. It made my life a little 
easier. Anybody that can do that, well, that's

32:41.102 --> 32:43.546
fine with me. Isn't that what they're for, is to try 
and make the researcher's life a little easier?

32:49.090 --> 32:57.259
Uh,

32:49.090 --> 32:57.259
yes, I think you can find very few researchers that 
would look at it that way. What do most researchers

32:58.180 --> 33:00.042
think they're for? I don't think there's a clear 
perception of what they're for by most

33:02.164 --> 33:07.309
researchers, especially the younger guys. All 
they see them doing is sucking up the older guys.

33:10.953 --> 33:15.298
They don't really, especially the younger guys 
don't see, they don't see anything coming back.

33:15.378 --> 33:17.460
It's coming back to them, they don't understand 
it.

33:21.237 --> 33:33.846
I think that probably the most constructive 
criticism I could offer to T's, and I've been doing

33:21.237 --> 33:33.846
this for years, and they pay attention to me, is 
that they spend a great deal of time, effort, and

33:21.237 --> 33:33.846
money advertising teas to everyone outside the 
university, and they ought to spend a little time

33:35.007 --> 33:41.838
and effort and money advertising teas within the 
university. They used to assume everybody knows

33:41.858 --> 33:45.523
what they do and why they're doing it. Like I say, 
maybe a few of the senior professors and guys who

33:45.543 --> 34:00.947
have been in research for a long time around here 
know what teas is doing and why they're doing it,

33:45.543 --> 34:00.947
but certainly the younger guys have no idea, no 
appreciation for what teas is doing. that's for

34:01.366 --> 34:02.728
them. Now T's may not do something directly for 
them, but they're getting a lot of benefit from

34:03.269 --> 34:10.741
some of the stuff that T's is doing. They just can't 
see that. That's why I say if T's spent a little time

34:12.203 --> 34:18.634
trying to educate the people here, they might...

34:18.654 --> 34:23.942
There'd probably be a lot less bitching and 
grousing going on. Well, I think that would help me

34:23.962 --> 34:26.807
out a lot. There is this unit. going around campus 
now which is kind of an interesting unit which

34:29.412 --> 34:56.230
shows a little bit about why i said the last thing 
that's tad tad is a t's assistant director

34:29.412 --> 34:56.230
what's the unit going that's a unit it's a unit of uh 
that you can use in various ways it's a unit of money

34:29.412 --> 34:56.230
it's a unit of paperwork generated It used to be the 
T's had a director and an associate director. The

35:01.227 --> 35:06.999
T's now has a director and associate director and 
five and a half assistant directors. So that's how

35:07.019 --> 35:11.388
the TAD came

35:07.019 --> 35:11.388
into being. You think that's given them some bad 
press on campus? Yes. The administration top

35:15.396 --> 35:17.680
heavy charges? Yes. And whenever people are 
scratching and fighting and clawing for square

35:20.830 --> 35:28.623
inches of research space, you usually don't go 
build yourself a palace.

35:31.488 --> 35:39.140
That's the other big boner move they made 
recently.

35:39.160 --> 35:43.447
Unless you can bring everybody else in with you. 
Unless you can provide all the research space that

35:43.467 --> 35:47.614
people desperately need, you don't... I have 300 
square foot offices sitting around with

35:47.999 --> 35:59.661
one person in the middle of them. I appreciate all 
the time.
