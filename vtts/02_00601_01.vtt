WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:05.958
They'd give me some flour sometimes and some sugar 
and coffee. I'm a coffee drinker. And tobacco. I

00:09.661 --> 00:13.104
have that to buy, but clothes, things, I don't buy 
that. Well, I buy some meat. They give me some meat

00:14.425 --> 00:17.688
sometimes. You're about 85 now, aren't you? Sir? 
You're about 85 years old? Yes, sir. 85. And they

00:24.834 --> 00:26.115
treat me fine. I don't find a bit of fault. I ain't 
had no clothes to buy. since I've been on the

00:32.920 --> 00:35.344
project. And I've been on it, I think, about nine, 
well, eight or nine years, I believe. But I

00:42.915 --> 00:44.677
believe. But I believe.

00:52.188 --> 00:57.175
He was talking about in the old war, time, the old 
slavery time. I can remember when I can remember

01:01.625 --> 01:11.216
when the Yankees come through and they carried my 
father, they carried two sisters and one brother.

01:12.538 --> 01:20.948
And they left me, and I can remember when my missus 
used to run in the garden upon the Yankees and tell

01:12.538 --> 01:20.948
us if they come, don't tell them where they're at. 
Told them don't tell nobody where they're at when

01:22.550 --> 01:24.832
they come. They all come and told me don't get 
scared now and tell them. who are the years. I told

01:30.141 --> 01:31.123
them no. He told them no. And when they come and ask 
for them, I told them I didn't know where they were.

01:36.591 --> 01:37.432
They was in the woods. And that was at the house. And 
my father, when my father left, he carried, he went

01:41.678 --> 01:54.897
away with the Yankees and carried two girls and one 
son, the oldest one. Carried them with him. And

01:57.498 --> 01:58.639
they beat the Yankees. And I can remember that. And 
my old missus was named Miss M. And the master was

02:03.964 --> 02:14.113
named Mr. Frank Irving. Mr.

02:14.133 --> 02:19.077
Frank Irving. Did they treat you pretty good? Yes, 
they treated me nice. They treated me nice as they

02:24.061 --> 02:26.003
could treat me. And then after they left, after 
they died, then I was still here. I've been here

02:32.635 --> 02:33.676
until yet. And the white folks all been treating me 
modernized ever since it moved me. They treat me on

02:39.863 --> 02:40.945
now. It knows me. They treat me nice. I came up over 
here from Mr. Young, from over to Fulton, Auburn,

02:45.710 --> 02:52.598
and come to Mr. Young's place up here. And he kept me 
there until he died, him and his wife. And then I

03:00.692 --> 03:05.697
come on in from that, on down here, and I'm here yet. 
And they all treat me nice. All the white folks that

03:08.800 --> 03:10.942
know me, they treat me nice. And if I want anything, 
I'll ask for it. I was taught it that way by my old

03:17.868 --> 03:20.531
master. Don't steal, don't lie. And if you want 
anything, ask for it. Be honest in what you get.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.111
That's what I was raised up with. And I'm there to be 
today.

03:35.899 --> 03:38.302
What's the government been doing for you here? 
They've been treating me fine. Ever since I've

03:40.205 --> 03:43.590
been here with the government, they treat me nice. 
I was in an old house down there. They took me out of

03:45.452 --> 03:49.077
the old house and put me up there in a good house 
where they could take care of me. And I'm in there

03:50.239 --> 03:51.140
yet. I don't find no fault. any more food to eat, any 
clothes to wear. They've been treating me just as

03:57.364 --> 03:59.506
nice as they can. I can't find no fault. Pretty, 
pretty happy, then. Yes, sir.

04:21.527 --> 04:22.828
I take care of the children. Tend to the children. 
Just like, you know, we bring a whole lot of

04:24.926 --> 04:28.711
children, you know, and put them down, you know, in 
one house. But if somebody have to look over them,

04:29.191 --> 04:33.175
you know, and tend to them that way. That's a house 
full of little children. And if you want to act bad,

04:36.379 --> 04:38.821
you know, they whoop you. They whoop you too. And if 
the old woman didn't tend to the children, they'd

04:41.004 --> 04:44.187
whoop her too. You know, to make her tend to the 
children, she wasn't doing nothing. But she

04:47.991 --> 04:49.953
wasn't a cryptic woman like me, you know. She 
wasn't a cryptic woman satisfied. She wasn't a

04:51.715 --> 04:53.237
cryptic woman like me. And they'd whip her. And 
they had trays. I don't know where you see the tray.

05:00.164 --> 05:02.826
Wooden trays dug out, you know, all about that 
long. And all of them, you know, would get around

05:03.547 --> 05:09.734
that tray with spoons and just eat like that 
because I ate out of the tray. With spoons, you

05:10.895 --> 05:15.560
know, and eat such as like moisture soup or 
something like that. A few of them, you know,

05:16.321 --> 05:18.022
before 12 o'clock. And all them children would get 
around there and just eat, eat, eat, eat all that

05:19.524 --> 05:23.308
down. And that old woman, you know, she would tend 
to her. Her name ain't Tisha. Yeah, I know that old

05:27.882 --> 05:29.925
woman. Her name ain't Tisha. It's like slopping 
hall. It's just like a tray, you know. It's just

05:35.632 --> 05:37.434
like a tray, you know, you have. It's made just like 
a hog trough, you know. In clothes, you know,

05:41.559 --> 05:46.965
they'd wash them things and scald them out for the 
children. I didn't see them scald, but that's what

05:48.007 --> 05:52.452
they told me, they'd scald them out, you know, for 
the children. And them children eat out of that

05:53.326 --> 06:01.276
thing, and just with spoon. If one reached his 
spoon over in the other's hand, over in the other's

06:01.556 --> 06:07.643
plate, he got hit him. Hit him, and it would knock 
that spoon back in on his side, on his side. And that

06:15.333 --> 06:17.195
was when we were children, you know. Wasn't able to 
tend to no other children. I had a brother, though,

06:22.520 --> 06:24.543
he couldn't tell the children. And, you know, just 
sit him down in a corner and put this child, you know

06:26.226 --> 06:35.399
how little children put this child between his leg 
and didn't hold his hand around his child. That's

06:35.419 --> 06:40.908
why he couldn't stand up with him, couldn't, you 
know, just nothing, you know, shake him this way in

06:35.419 --> 06:40.908
the arms. I can remember that. I had a brother named 
Wright. And he just shake that child, sit him in the

06:45.495 --> 06:47.818
floor. It was too little to pick him up. Yes, sir. 
And if that child kicked much, he'd kick him over

06:51.005 --> 06:59.594
too, you know, and the woman would come down, spike 
him, and get the child back in his home. And they had

07:00.956 --> 07:08.504
certain times to come to them chums, and to come to 
them chums, and to come to them chums. Kyle, I say,

07:08.524 --> 07:10.326
would go to the calf, you know. Uh-huh. You know, 
they'd have certain time. Now, Kyle come to his

07:13.009 --> 07:15.291
calf at night. Well, they'd come at 10 o'clock, 
every day, 10 o'clock, to all them babies. Them was

07:19.616 --> 07:20.657
nice, you know. Them who didn't nurse, they didn't 
come to them at all. The old lady fell. It wasn't big

07:24.211 --> 07:27.595
enough to eat, you know. The old mother had time to 
come. When that horn blowed, it blowed a horn for

07:32.500 --> 07:36.585
the mothers, you know. They just come just like 
cows. It's funny, you know, coming to the

07:39.328 --> 07:41.371
children. Out of the field. Out of the field. How 
long did you nurse the baby? A couple of years? How

07:46.844 --> 07:49.929
long would they nurse a baby until it was big enough 
to walk, I guess? Yeah, something about nine

07:49.949 --> 07:53.895
months or something like that, you know. They'd 
get big enough, you know, to eat. To get to eat. And

07:58.503 --> 08:02.870
they'd come to, all the time, come down and nurse 
that baby at ten o'clock. Ten o'clock in the day.

08:05.094 --> 08:05.494
Twice a day? Yes, ma'am. Ten o'clock in the day and 
three o'clock in the day. They'd come to that baby

08:09.581 --> 08:11.184
and nurse it. Twice a day? Yes, and twice a day. Come 
there and nurse that baby. He couldn't eat, you

08:14.827 --> 08:16.109
know. But one could eat, he wouldn't come till 
dinner time. But one little one who couldn't eat,

08:18.891 --> 08:21.153
he'd come to it. That old woman had a time of that 
sort, I'm sure. Yes, and I knew that. And I

08:30.121 --> 08:33.023
remember, you see a scar up in my forehead? Kind of 
scar. I had slipped out and some boys was throwing

08:36.266 --> 08:43.092
and knocked the scar in my head when I was little. 
Oh, it's way up here. It's right underneath your

08:45.038 --> 08:46.920
hairline. Yes. When I was little. Slippin' off out 
there in the old woman's slopping room. I called

08:52.826 --> 08:55.049
it, because that's where it's further. Yes, and 
that's called Boy Full of Rockin' Hittin' Here.

09:02.817 --> 09:06.782
When I was young, you know, it hit me. When I was 
little. Coming on out there, I called it old lady's

09:09.265 --> 09:13.129
slopping room. But there's a house, you know, 
where it fed all the children. I call that a slop

09:17.992 --> 09:21.835
room, where it fed all the children. Who did the 
cooking for the plantation? I don't know what the

09:25.618 --> 09:28.481
old woman's name done the cooking. Miss Clement 
did tell me here not long ago who done the main

09:29.562 --> 09:34.086
cooking. You know, they didn't cook in the kitchen 
like that. They have an off kitchen, off from the

09:38.390 --> 09:41.973
house. Yes, sir. And then packed it, you know, to 
the kitchen. Packed it to the kitchen. They didn't

09:48.279 --> 09:51.402
have, there wasn't cooking in their kitchen, 
dining room. I was a very big girl when I know that

09:52.323 --> 09:58.769
Mrs. Benjamin had a kitchen and a dining room mixed 
together. I was a big old girl. They cooked, you

10:01.872 --> 10:03.393
know, on the outside. Right in the yard, but no, 
they cooked it out there. And then brought it to the

10:07.517 --> 10:08.658
house. Brought it to their kitchen. when I was a 
child. They had some of the slaves who worked in the

10:12.388 --> 10:19.795
house and then some who worked on the yard, isn't 
that right? No, them working in the yard, men

10:19.995 --> 10:29.102
working in the yard some nights, but them there who 
worked in the kitchen, they didn't have nothing to

10:19.995 --> 10:29.102
do in the yard. And they had one, one, you know, to 
make up beds, and one to make up beds, you know, and

10:30.344 --> 10:40.272
one to cook. And then they go, they have 60 times, 
make a bed, and then they go to feel. And they had a

10:44.849 --> 10:46.410
regular nurse, you know. The nurse, you never did 
see an old mister with the baby, never in no time.

10:51.815 --> 10:52.776
They had a regular nurse. It's like, you know, 
you'd hire somebody's nurse, but be a grown woman

10:55.018 --> 10:58.781
nurse. Tend to that baby. And we keep them, because 
never did, never did care to old mister. Daddy was

11:04.726 --> 11:06.488
hungry night or day. Now, Daddy was hungry. They 
carried that to her. They tended that baby. That

11:12.763 --> 11:15.987
baby slept with the nurses and all of them. Yes, 
they slept with them. Didn't have nothing to do.

11:19.751 --> 11:23.715
Carry the baby and sit there and tell the nurse. And 
then after the nurse, you know, then you carry it

11:24.336 --> 11:29.642
back, tend to it. You didn't have to just, she tend 
to it, you know, and give it to you. You give it to her

11:33.666 --> 11:36.870
and nurse it, how cold it is. And you carry that baby 
back on in that room where you was. Well, did the

11:41.642 --> 11:45.426
mistress nurse the baby, or did she have them? She 
nursed from the breast. But see, she nursed this

11:47.267 --> 11:51.491
baby after he'd be hungry. Well, the nurse would 
bring it to her and let her nurse it. And then when

11:56.136 --> 11:58.918
she nursed, she'd hand it right back, night or day, 
you know. She'd take that baby night and day and

11:59.879 --> 12:02.722
hand it back to her. If that baby was any kind of 
sick, that nurse had to sit up there and night and

12:02.742 --> 12:06.385
tend to it. You never did, huh? Ma'am? You never 
would take care of it like that. No. The nurse had to

12:12.489 --> 12:13.250
do it. No. Well, you see, that's done now, my dear. 
That's right. So it's not done now, my dear. Well,

12:17.676 --> 12:24.005
my niece's granddaughter here, she take care of 
baby, and her mother hardly ever take it. And she

12:24.065 --> 12:27.150
said, you know, they say you sleep at times. She 
never do hardly ever take it. I know a lot of women do

12:29.213 --> 12:30.955
that, don't you? Don't think of them. No, I don't 
think of them. Well, do you remember any of the

12:34.398 --> 12:37.282
slaves being sold? Do you remember any slave 
sellers? You know, men that were just buying

12:39.144 --> 12:41.407
sales. No, sir. I never did see it. I sure never did 
know of that, you know. We heard talk of it, but then

12:46.214 --> 12:50.199
Irene got us after slaves, Irene. We heard talk of 
it. You see them talk about, you know, putting them

12:53.704 --> 12:59.372
on stumps, you know, or something high, you know, 
and beating them off like you did cattle. bit them

12:59.977 --> 13:01.800
off like a deep kettle. None of your folks were ever 
sold then? No, none of them ever was sold. You were

13:06.266 --> 13:09.330
born right there and never did leave? Born right 
there and stayed there until I was about nine, ten

13:09.350 --> 13:14.317
years old, maybe even more. Stayed right there. We 
didn't know where to go. Mom and them didn't know

13:17.622 --> 13:19.785
where to go. You see, after she was over, just like 
you turn something out, you know, didn't know

13:19.825 --> 13:24.291
where to go. That's just where they stayed. Didn't 
know where to go. Turned us out just like, you know,

13:29.356 --> 13:33.682
he turned our cattle, I say. Anywhere to go. Do you 
remember when the Civil War was being fought?

13:38.088 --> 13:41.553
Well, I can't remember much about it, but I 
remember this much. When Mr. Beckman was gone a

13:43.355 --> 13:54.611
long time, looked like a long time, and I remember 
the next morning when he got up. Now, don't knock

13:54.651 --> 13:56.393
that back there. Well, we all got up and all of them 
went to the house. Went to the house to see old

14:02.344 --> 14:04.026
Master. And I thought old Master was dead, but it 
wasn't he had been off to the war and come back. But

14:10.853 --> 14:12.635
then I didn't know he was going to the war. I just 
knew he was gone a long time. All the niggas

14:14.998 --> 14:17.961
gathered around to see old Master again.

14:20.904 --> 14:22.966
And old Master didn't tell you it was free. He 
didn't tell you that? No, he didn't tell. They were

14:25.769 --> 14:26.430
right there. I think now they said they'd wait 
until six months out of that, six months, and turn

14:27.271 --> 14:35.419
them loose on the 19th of June. That's why, you 
know, you celebrate that day, colored folks.

14:41.285 --> 14:42.106
Celebrate that day. Celebrate that

14:42.927 --> 14:47.492
day. Missed that line, I missed it, you know. And 
just catched it by a wrist this way, you know. Both

14:52.797 --> 14:55.320
of them pushed down in the rocking chair. And when 
Mr. Bethany come home, she was crying. And Mr.

14:59.445 --> 15:01.868
Bethany asked her what was the matter, you know. 
She told me that Martha Albert hurt her wrist. And

15:07.634 --> 15:12.438
she asked her then, says, what you doing in this 
house here hurting old Mr.? She said she wasn't

15:12.458 --> 15:14.921
hurting old Mr. I hope she saw her down. Well, they 
took that old woman, poor old woman, carried her in

15:17.243 --> 15:22.168
the peach orchard and whipped her. And, you know, 
just tied her hand this way, you know, around the

15:23.144 --> 15:26.928
feature of the tree. I remember that just as well 
looked like to me, I can't. And around the tree and

15:30.932 --> 15:33.514
hooked her. And what she couldn't do wrong was just 
kick her feet, you know, just kick her feet. But it

15:36.897 --> 15:40.761
just had her clothes all down to her waist, you 
know. It didn't have her plum naked, but it had her

15:40.781 --> 15:44.505
clothes down to her waist. And every now and then 
they'd hook her, you know, and then snuff the pipe

15:44.525 --> 15:50.991
out on her, you know, just snuff pipe out on her. You 
know, the embers in the pipe, where you'll see the

15:51.595 --> 15:54.458
pipe smoking. Blow them out on? Mm-hmm. Good Lord, 
him, mercy. Blow them out on. Did she scream? Yeah,

16:01.146 --> 16:02.247
I think she was. I think she did. But you see, we were 
glad to go out there. Well, it was, you know,

16:06.893 --> 16:11.939
because our old Marshal was a whooper, and then 
Uncle Saul. Uncle Saul was a whooper. She'd had an

16:13.921 --> 16:15.403
overseer, Uncle Saul. Her papa was an overseer. 
But he'd had a whooper. And whooped her, too. And

16:21.852 --> 16:23.034
then he showed his whip on. Well, he whooped her so 
then at night they had to grease her back. Grease

16:29.706 --> 16:30.327
her back. I don't know what kind of grease they had, 
but they sure greased her back at night, you know,

16:30.367 --> 16:35.256
that way. They just greased her back. And so after 
they whooped her so long, whooped her then so long

16:38.161 --> 16:44.713
that way, they quit. They couldn't. Gave her her 
dinner late that evening. They gave her her

16:48.458 --> 16:49.259
dinner. She was hooked so bad then, you know, she 
didn't want to eat, you know. If you put in the hook

16:53.203 --> 16:57.427
you had for a day, you ain't want to eat. Oh, no. 
Because a little child, you can hook a little child

16:58.728 --> 17:00.750
now. He'll get mad, you know, and don't want to eat 
nothing.

17:06.295 --> 17:08.678
So I saw then he was going to hook my mama. He had a 
brother, the oldest brother named Cal. And he was

17:13.583 --> 17:16.125
going to hook my mother's boy. Packing water. And 
she's gonna fight him. Is that right? Yes. She's

17:21.433 --> 17:22.234
gonna fight him. You see, one portion of the people 
belong to Mr. Bethany, and one portion, you know,

17:22.714 --> 17:28.541
belong to, belong to his wife. Wife, you know, just 
like, you know, you have a lot of niggas, you know,

17:29.002 --> 17:37.072
and they give you a portion of them, and your wife a 
portion of them. Her people give you a heap of them,

17:37.092 --> 17:40.917
and then your people give you some. Well, that 
makes two parts. You got a part, and your wife got a

17:42.158 --> 17:45.302
part, you know, of colored folks, by the way. And so 
Miss Adeline wouldn't let Uncle Saul whoop her.

17:50.913 --> 17:51.974
That was her side, you know. That wasn't her 
nigger. She wouldn't let Uncle Saul whoop her that

17:52.775 --> 17:54.837
way. Well, then they called her Sassy nigger. 
Sassy called Uncle Saul whoop her. About the boy

17:59.562 --> 18:00.823
packing water. You know, he'd pack water, you 
know, all day. And that Uncle Saul, if he stayed

18:04.687 --> 18:10.833
late, you know, and when he got to the water where 
Uncle Saul was, the old seal was, he'd just pitch it

18:04.687 --> 18:10.833
out. Just pitch it out. That's the chance the 
children could get to him. And he whooped him and

18:15.134 --> 18:17.978
still let him. Oh. Yeah, he whooped him and still 
let him. Now, and, uh, and, and, uh, so, Uncle

18:22.085 --> 18:33.081
Jesse, you know, he wasn't, Stepdaddy, he wasn't, 
wasn't, uh, he wasn't, now he's gonna get me away.

18:33.923 --> 18:36.947
He, he wasn't born, he wasn't, he wasn't one of Mr. 
Beckham's leaders. He was a Payne's. No,

18:40.493 --> 18:42.395
Stepdaddy, yes, but he was a Payne's. Yeah, he was a 
Payne's. And he'd do anything and he would come

18:44.800 --> 18:49.467
with me. Come with me. And his head was red and he was 
red. Where'd he come from? I think he come from

18:57.059 --> 18:59.123
Louisiana, somewhere. Anyhow, he come 
somewhere. I couldn't exactly tell where he come

19:01.847 --> 19:03.510
from. Because my mama come from Mississippi. And 
when he'd back up, you know, I don't know if y'all

19:06.400 --> 19:10.927
ever see the corner of him. Yes, the one in the rail 
fence. Yes, yes. He'd back up in that, and they

19:14.072 --> 19:16.195
wouldn't help him. He'd get him a stick and keep him 
off. Yes. And he was a great big old man, you know. He

19:23.066 --> 19:24.367
wouldn't let them help him, you see. And the 
monster wouldn't let him hurt him because he

19:25.049 --> 19:32.560
wouldn't let the overseers. No, they'd whoop you. 
The monster would make them whoop you when they see

19:34.383 --> 19:36.626
you in the field. And they wouldn't let him whoop 
them at all, wouldn't they? And the old monster

19:40.289 --> 19:44.113
would tell them, rather than kill him or something 
like that, don't hurt him. But don't kill him, but

19:44.854 --> 19:46.356
whoop him. He wouldn't whoop him, I tell you. No, he 
wouldn't whoop him. No, sir, he wouldn't whoop

19:50.440 --> 19:52.161
him. Well, how would they punish him then? Give me a 
year of corn? Give me a year of corn. That's like,

19:58.168 --> 20:01.551
you know, you give me a year of corn, And that would 
be for my dinner or my breakfast. When we come home

20:05.987 --> 20:09.111
to dinner, he said he'd give me air corn. He said 
he'd share it often, plow along and eat it. Just

20:12.415 --> 20:14.297
plow along and eat it. Night comes, he'd give me air 
corn. And that's the way they said it, you know,

20:16.980 --> 20:20.844
punishing him, you know, wouldn't give him 
nothing to eat. And so it looked like he was moving

20:21.325 --> 20:24.929
along too slow, too fast with that, you know, too 
good. Too good with that, you know, just giving him

20:25.670 --> 20:27.672
corn. And his unit, you know, drinking water and 
going just the same. That's why they wouldn't give

20:31.552 --> 20:32.814
him none. Give him none. Wouldn't give him 
nothing, you know, but let him drink water, you

20:34.898 --> 20:37.482
know. And he lived just the same. And he lived with 
Mama 32 years before he died. Before he died. And he

20:52.528 --> 20:56.715
never did have a scar that the old boss put on him. 
Did he talk like you all there? No, he had a broken

20:59.552 --> 21:00.953
language. He had a broken language. Some kind of 
broken language. I wonder what that was. I don't

21:06.438 --> 21:07.019
know. So he was red-red, and his head was red-red. 
His head was red-red. And my sister, we had

21:13.585 --> 21:17.548
sisters, you know, half-sisters, you know, to 
him. Well, they were red and their head red. No.

21:22.673 --> 21:23.974
Where did they live? They lived in Belleville, 
over in Belleville. They do? Oh, yeah, Bellville.

21:28.606 --> 21:29.787
So we ought to go over and see them some day. Yeah, we 
go through Bellville. So we'll go over and see

21:31.709 --> 21:34.052
them. Well, uh, wonder what they paid for this, 
this, your stepdaddy. How come? Well, paid was,

21:41.360 --> 21:43.923
you know, he was a payer. Just to pay them was what he 
called. But you see, I don't know what they paid for

21:46.847 --> 21:49.230
him. They bought him, you know. And I guess he was 
worth so much they didn't want to hurt him. Didn't

21:54.176 --> 21:55.898
want to hurt him. And, uh, You see, he had blown to 
two sets, folks. Two sets of people, you know. You

22:03.891 --> 22:09.678
see, he would blow to the pains, then he'd blow to 
some people, you know, them, but they all stayed

22:03.891 --> 22:09.678
with him. You see, he wouldn't do like me and sell 
them. Just sell them, you know, just like, you

22:13.282 --> 22:17.447
know, I was a little nigga, you know, I wouldn't act 
like you'd sell me somebody else. I wouldn't act

22:17.867 --> 22:20.831
like you wouldn't be fighting, knocking with a 
good hand. You'd sell me somebody else. That's

22:22.913 --> 22:24.194
what I would do here, baby. I see. That's where they 
done them. Well, what about getting married? How

22:28.507 --> 22:30.469
did they go about marrying the slaves? Well, they 
told me to jump over the broom backer. I don't know.

22:35.476 --> 22:37.278
They told me to jump over the broom backer. I don't 
know. Well, did they have church? Did the slaves

22:40.443 --> 22:41.584
have church? No. I never remember no church. Mama 
said, Raleigh Church. I didn't remember that part

22:46.210 --> 22:47.993
of Raleigh Church. It would have been a tub. A tub of 
water sitting just like this thing is, you know.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.081
And that would catch your voice. And they would 
have church around that tub. All of them get around

22:56.681 --> 22:57.702
the tub. Get around the tub. Old Master didn't want 
them having church. They don't have no church. No,

23:02.648 --> 23:04.270
didn't have a church. And Old Master come along 
with one of them. One of them was there having

23:08.314 --> 23:13.360
church around the tub, and he's down praying. And 
so he's down there praying, just praying. Old

23:17.926 --> 23:20.028
Master come in, he just praying. He come in, he did, 
and told him, get up from there. He didn't get up. He

23:23.396 --> 23:24.357
just prayed. He said, Old Master, come this way 
with me. He quick prayed and then asked me, Lord,

23:27.521 --> 23:30.665
have mercy on me, Old Master. Lord, have mercy on 
me, Old Master. Lord, have mercy on me. I said, with

23:36.052 --> 23:39.616
my shoulder, with a bull hook. He said, have mercy 
on me, Old Master. I said, Old Master. He wouldn't

23:44.282 --> 23:47.406
get up and just flinch. He just prayed for Old 
Master. So old Marston stepped back and said, I'm

23:51.149 --> 23:53.972
going to mind to kick you naked. I'm going to mind to 
kick you naked. We could have him just stop praying

23:56.774 --> 24:00.017
and know he had to go home and live and pray. He'd go 
home and live and pray. Because he wouldn't stop.

24:04.361 --> 24:05.903
Well, that was through the Lord, you know. That's 
because of that. Yeah, the Lord works a lot of

24:07.404 --> 24:09.286
things. Yes, because the Lord suffered him to stay 
down there and get that hope and then pray. You

24:13.490 --> 24:14.711
know, just keep on praying. I think I jumped up. I 
don't know. It seemed like me I jumped up. Johnny,

24:21.322 --> 24:36.546
that business of

24:21.322 --> 24:36.546
hiring some of the Negroes, the good hands, you 
know, Good women, good men, going off and breeding

24:36.830 --> 24:40.514
them like cattle. Do you remember anything about 
that? No, I didn't know anything. They wouldn't

24:43.358 --> 24:45.941
let children know that, you know, but I heard it 
after. After that, they'd do that. But see, when

24:47.883 --> 24:50.567
they're coming up, they wouldn't let us know 
nothing about it, nothing like that. But they said

24:51.047 --> 24:52.389
that was sure so. You know, just like a big, 
fine-looking woman, a big, fine-looking man, you

24:53.710 --> 24:58.276
know. Old boss wants, you know, children from him, 
you know. They just find him up in the house or

25:01.540 --> 25:06.786
somewhere, you know, going off and leaving him in 
there. They wanted to breed them like they were

25:07.559 --> 25:11.024
hogs or horses, something like that, I said. That 
sounds like it. Yes, sir. And they said that's what

25:15.711 --> 25:19.135
they used to do in slavery time. Did they whoop the 
slaves much? Do you remember how they whooped

25:21.579 --> 25:23.582
them? The biggest whooping ever I knew, the gift 
they gave Martha Albert. The biggest whooping

25:27.668 --> 25:30.371
ever I knew. Mr. Benson, they didn't whoop his 
niggas much. They had to do something like this

25:33.476 --> 25:35.018
thing. you know, bad for him to hook them. Well, did 
the slaves ever try to slip away? Did they ever try

25:43.536 --> 25:44.637
to run off? No, not known on the place where we was. I 
never heard them say they run off from there. You

25:51.203 --> 25:58.870
know, old place, I heard them stay in the woods and 
so long until they'd wear the clothes off and slip

25:51.203 --> 25:58.870
up. Now, I heard Mama say when she was a girl, When 
she was a girl, she brought me sipping. When she was

26:06.857 --> 26:11.446
a girl, there was one old woman run off. She did run 
off. The beaters' association run off. And every

26:14.892 --> 26:19.541
night she'd sleep home and somebody would have her 
something to eat. And she'd get that vittles and go

26:20.122 --> 26:27.195
on back in the woods, go on back and stay in the 
woods. You know, just they're telling it over, you

26:27.428 --> 26:32.914
know, because you see, I don't know what their 
name, see so-and-so, ever see them? Say no. Well,

26:33.575 --> 26:35.758
you tell them if they come home, ring out with them. 
Ring out with them if they come home. Well, I'd be

26:38.441 --> 26:40.203
all the way, you know, they'd come. Say once this 
man stayed in the woods so long, tell you his hair on

26:40.223 --> 26:45.169
him long like a dog. Just grow up, you know, and 
stayed in the woods. Just stayed in the woods. And

26:51.396 --> 26:52.457
they couldn't get him out. Would any of them run off 
and get plumb free? Did you ever hear anybody talk

26:55.482 --> 26:58.006
about them? I hear them talk about them going off, 
you know, going off to places where they're free.

27:02.995 --> 27:04.457
But here's what I hear her say. I didn't know that. 
She said just like there'd be some white people,

27:06.441 --> 27:18.040
you know, would come along, you know, and he'd just 
get them off, you know, take them, carry them off

27:06.441 --> 27:18.040
where there wouldn't be no slave or wouldn't be 
beat up, you know. and came off right away. There

27:20.884 --> 27:26.371
was two or three of them that said that white folk 
would catch them, three or four, you know, colored

27:20.884 --> 27:26.371
people off right away. Peek up the children. They 
used to go in wagons, you know, go around wagons

27:29.455 --> 27:33.241
with covers on them. I've seen covers since I've 
been beaten up in a wagon with covers on them, just

27:34.042 --> 27:41.232
take them and go on them. When I was a child, I seen a 
little boy, a man jumped out of the old covered

27:41.252 --> 27:47.200
wagon And caught the child. Caught him. And got for 
a bill with the child. Well, I don't know. But they

27:57.488 --> 27:58.269
caught him. Caught the child. And I had a 
grandchild. They took him off. Is that right? Who

28:08.764 --> 28:09.505
took him off? I don't know. They took him off. What 
do you know? Yes, they took that child off. Mom

28:17.025 --> 28:20.250
didn't have whatever they wanted. They took it 
off.

28:24.456 --> 28:26.920
They took it off. But they got it at the time. Well, 
can you remember what happened when they set you

28:31.287 --> 28:35.173
free? Do you remember what the... Can you remember 
how the old master acted? No, so I can't remember

28:40.309 --> 28:43.253
that, you know, can't remember that. But I 
remember, you know, time to give them a big dinner,

28:43.774 --> 28:47.439
you know, on the 19th. Is that right? On the 19th, 
you know, that's called it. They said they'd have

28:51.244 --> 28:54.328
to give them a big dinner on the 19th. But now we 
didn't know. I don't hide the other side of the

28:57.452 --> 29:01.317
folks, you know, we didn't know. They just 
thought, you know, just feeding us, you know, just

29:02.098 --> 29:06.664
had a long table. and just had just a little of 
everything you want to eat, you know, and drink,

29:07.387 --> 29:12.071
you know. And they said that was on the 19th, and 
everything you want to eat and drink. Well, you

29:18.817 --> 29:20.619
see, I didn't know what that was for. I just, you 
know, it wasn't wise like it is now. Anything a

29:25.764 --> 29:28.466
child six, seven years old can tell you. That's 
right. It wasn't wise. That's the way they done it.

29:34.431 --> 29:36.313
It was a big dinner, Mr. Besson and them. Mr. 
Bethany's

29:36.631 --> 29:42.480
granddaughter stayed right across town. And she 
got a daughter to stay out here in the country, our

29:42.520 --> 29:48.109
young mistress. Out here in the country. I

29:50.452 --> 29:56.501
would have left her. Have you ever been down in the 
brass bottoms any? Yeah, that's right. I stayed

30:01.630 --> 30:03.072
down at the bottom. I didn't say stay right down in 
it, but I didn't say I'd wait down there. I'd wait

30:07.878 --> 30:08.619
down there. I cropped in there. And when I moved 
over here, I just moved out of the bottom, waiting

30:10.001 --> 30:14.667
right on the banks of the river. And you don't make 
some crops down there. Yes, I couldn't go close to

30:18.873 --> 30:21.156
the river. On account, you know, afraid the horses 
would get scraped, look down in the river and run

30:22.097 --> 30:26.342
off with me. And I used to plow. Yeah, I used to work 
down there at Bradley's Bottom. On whose place

30:31.587 --> 30:33.069
were you working then? Payne's? No, I'd been 
working on Payne's, but I worked then on the book

30:34.391 --> 30:39.236
place. It was called the book place. Austin, you 
know, Austin Children, I called it. I had worked at

30:46.204 --> 30:48.787
Austin Children then. It was called the book 
place. I had worked at the Austin Children

30:49.928 --> 30:53.812
schools, you know. And that's where I worked at 
about four or five years. Down there on that book

30:58.913 --> 31:00.535
place. They're claiming some parts of the 
Bottoms, they won't let the folks leave the place

31:02.198 --> 31:06.664
they're living on. Colored folks. You know, just 
make them stay there and work year after year.

31:15.035 --> 31:18.120
Well, that must be some way down the Bottom 
somewhere. Well, down there on the book place,

31:23.281 --> 31:29.047
Some place in the world, they let you go just as far 
and dead as you want to go, you know. And then see,

31:29.847 --> 31:33.391
they know your crop wasn't going to clutch, you 
know. And so next year you had to stay to wake out to

31:34.131 --> 31:37.315
death. If it didn't, you know, take all your 
horses, cows, and everything away from you. Maybe

31:41.819 --> 31:42.920
it was nothing. Maybe it was nothing. You see, 
that's why they keep them there, you know, that

31:43.661 --> 31:46.103
way. Just so they, you know, they could get 
everything they had if they didn't wake. And good

31:51.293 --> 31:55.819
way for some of them to just take and give 
everything a hand up and going off.
