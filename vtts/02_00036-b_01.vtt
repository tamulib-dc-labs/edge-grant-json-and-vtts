WEBVTT

00:03.997 --> 00:13.587
What

00:03.997 --> 00:13.587
other places were there at Northgate or anywhere 
else for Aggies to go and have a pretty good time? We

00:13.607 --> 00:14.788
used to go to Lakeview Club. Describe that. That's 
out northeast of town. Northeast of town, and it's

00:18.552 --> 00:22.075
just a hole in the wall. You'd have that live band, 
and you could dance, and there was always dancing

00:22.095 --> 00:26.099
going on. I mean, you could dance. There was quite a 
few little places like that, but we'd go out there.

00:29.903 --> 00:31.725
We could have our beer out there, but It wasn't to 
excess. I mean we'd bring back a few guys that liked

00:34.332 --> 00:39.838
to drink a lot, but most of us would have our two or 
three beers. I mean we couldn't afford a lot of

00:39.858 --> 00:41.199
beer. What time would you go from when to when? We'd 
get out there about 9 o'clock and come back about

00:44.903 --> 00:47.746
12, 30 or 1. And you would wear what? Blue jeans and a 
shirt. I mean that was the, we didn't much change

00:53.112 --> 00:56.095
our dress. Were there any well-known performers 
that you? You know what, we went out there one time

01:01.253 --> 01:05.118
and saw ZZ Top. They had a rock and roll weekend or 
something, and ZZ Top came up. And they always had

01:09.944 --> 01:18.414
one or two country westerns, or every weekend was 
mostly country western, but I always wanted to go

01:09.944 --> 01:18.414
to the rock concerts. You never could find any 
around College Station. Brian, he had to go to

01:20.637 --> 01:24.242
Houston or Austin or somewhere. Did you all do that 
much? Yeah. I had friends in Austin, so if I wanted a

01:27.578 --> 01:36.852
date I'd go over there and grab a ride with a guy from 
Austin, and we'd go over there and have a good time

01:27.578 --> 01:36.852
in Austin, and go to Dallas. We used to go to the 
Houston Astros baseball games with Butch

01:38.054 --> 01:43.442
Gootsman every week. And he was the loudest, most 
obnoxious fan that place had. several years. How

01:50.276 --> 01:53.100
did, did he get y'all tickets? Yeah, he got us 
tickets. He coached to get us tickets. I mean we

01:55.905 --> 01:59.971
could pretty much go see the Astros any time we 
wanted to and not have to pay. So that was a fun trip.

02:07.184 --> 02:13.193
Mr. Rutter dies in the spring of 1970, your 
freshman year. All right. Then the next fall Jack

02:14.575 --> 02:19.202
Williams comes in. Did that make any impression on 
you all at all? Were you aware of that? We did. We

02:25.471 --> 02:35.807
weren't sure how

02:25.471 --> 02:35.807
he was going to take the place of Mr. Rutter. I think 
he did a good job. I mean, I think he took the legacy

02:40.075 --> 02:47.611
that Earl Rudder left and carried it through to 
fruition. I mean, he made it work. You are so

02:49.595 --> 02:50.597
correct. He made, you know, and there was a lot of We 
were in the protest era, okay? Right there was all,

02:56.315 --> 02:59.659
you know, Vietnam War, everybody's protesting. 
And, you know, there was a few people a few times,

02:59.679 --> 03:03.323
you know, us two percenters. We were the liberals, 
okay? Architecture students were the only

03:04.885 --> 03:08.068
liberals that campus knew. All of us had longer 
hair. I mean, we had, they considered us hippies

03:10.371 --> 03:13.254
and all this kind of stuff. But, yeah, we, you know, 
there was a few times that we walked down, marched

03:13.274 --> 03:22.585
down to that Williams president, the president's 
house, and had our signs and that kind of stuff. I

03:25.440 --> 03:27.843
mean it wasn't a big deal. It may have been 30 or 40 
people as a whole, but it was just to be part of the

03:27.944 --> 03:35.133
culture at the time. And it was never to degrade the 
university. And we never got any press. So it

03:43.184 --> 03:48.271
wasn't like we were doing anything that anybody 
wanted to know about. But that was about the extent

03:48.371 --> 03:52.977
of the protest on that campus was the few a few 
times, but I think that's what he did. Yeah. I have a

03:58.042 --> 04:11.370
speech I give fairly often that I call Camelot on 
the Brasses, using the Kennedy idea of Camelot at a

03:58.042 --> 04:11.370
special time, and my major point is only Earl 
Rudder could have done what he did. only Jack

04:12.717 --> 04:14.861
Williams could have done what he did. If they had 
been reversed chronologically, they both would

04:15.642 --> 04:19.228
have failed. Rudder did what needed to be done, 
Williams built on it, and thank goodness for the

04:20.430 --> 04:27.421
effect of both. Yeah, we, you know, when I got 
there, the non-rugs were still kind of outcasts. I

04:33.010 --> 04:37.037
mean, we were still considered not Aggies, we were 
still considered, I mean, The old army just did not

04:38.232 --> 04:39.953
like us. They didn't, you know, they thought we 
were basically, and it literally did. It

04:43.977 --> 04:45.198
separated the school. It put one end of the student 
body on one end of campus and one end, you know, the

04:45.278 --> 04:51.103
rest of them on the other. I think the greatest 
thing they did was put all the women down by the

04:51.664 --> 04:58.229
corps guys because all of a sudden all the non-regs 
wanted to go down to the corps dorms. I mean, the

04:58.249 --> 05:00.832
female dorms, the co-ed dorms. So I think they did 
it as well as any, and it could have been done, and I

05:00.852 --> 05:08.138
think, I think it's basically also because we're 
Texans that it really – when all else fails, you're

05:08.489 --> 05:17.957
still a Texan. So you're going to make it work one 
way or another, and I think that's why it works, and

05:17.977 --> 05:22.962
I think it's still why it works. Let me give you – 
back to – you're a sophomore, and you're now on the

05:22.982 --> 05:31.649
varsity baseball team. Describe the difference 
in being a varsity baseballer and a freshman

05:32.510 --> 05:36.994
baseballer. Well, my sophomore year, they 
eliminated the freshman team. So now we have

05:40.915 --> 05:46.803
freshmen on the varsity, which everybody that 
made it through that freshman year hate. There's

05:47.363 --> 05:49.306
only about four of us left, four or five. The rest of 
them, a lot of kids just did not come back. They

05:51.549 --> 05:52.991
didn't want to tag. They transferred. So there's 
about five sophomores that moved on, which is

05:54.313 --> 05:58.979
about average. And there's about nine or ten 
freshmen now. They didn't have as many freshmen

06:02.764 --> 06:05.829
because they didn't have a freshman team. So you 
just had, you know, Coach Chandler brought about

06:07.298 --> 06:09.241
nine freshmen on. So we have a split of about five, 
nine, eight or nine and then the rest are

06:09.281 --> 06:14.648
upperclassmen. And there's not too many seniors. 
There's only about three or four seniors. And it's

06:19.114 --> 06:25.542
the same, I mean, if there's anything to be said for 
Tom Chandler, nothing changes with him. It's the

06:25.623 --> 06:26.103
same. So we knew the routine. I mean, we knew what we 
needed to do in the fall, what we needed to get ready

06:27.545 --> 06:31.891
for. We practiced probably, we have six weeks of 
practice. We probably practiced four weeks in the

06:37.759 --> 06:44.328
old cow barn because it rained every single day in 
the fall. I mean my sophomore year. I never thought

06:46.191 --> 06:47.593
it would stop raining. So we had batting practice 
in there. We dragged the cow down in there, the

06:50.437 --> 06:55.244
horse. Now this is just across the tracks. No, this 
was down next to the dairy, I mean the old creamery.

07:03.576 --> 07:05.700
We called it the cow barn. It was a big barn that's 
now an administration building of some kind.

07:11.116 --> 07:13.980
That's where we used to practice inside that. It 
was dirt floor. I mean that's really – Oh, are you

07:15.222 --> 07:24.334
talking about the old –

07:15.222 --> 07:24.334
right next to the library? Yeah. Oh, boy. Anyway, 
we'll think of it later. They converted it. Yeah,

07:30.022 --> 07:31.324
yeah. But they used to have dirt floor after they 
had all the horses and cattle. The pavilion,

07:34.711 --> 07:35.592
right. That's exactly what we called the cow barn. 
So we'd go down there and practice, and we'd have to

07:38.035 --> 07:42.741
clean up all the cow stuff and have baseball 
practice. Because there was no place where we

07:42.761 --> 07:50.571
could, we literally warmed up underneath the 
stands, underneath the cow field. We loosened our

07:50.611 --> 07:56.859
arms up and then we'd run over there to take some 
grounders and do some, and we'd hit in a cage over

07:50.611 --> 07:56.859
there. And that literally was fall ball, and then 
of course It was getting harder for me because I was

08:04.175 --> 08:10.482
falling behind in architecture, which I didn't 
want to do. My structures classes were hurting me

08:10.522 --> 08:14.126
and everything else. So in the spring, I decided 
I'm going to give it one more try. And I just could

08:20.133 --> 08:21.715
not keep up. And I almost failed out of school. That 
spring, I went in and talked to Tom. And he says, I

08:27.041 --> 08:28.203
understand. He says, you're making a wise 
decision. You're welcome to stay in the dorm. I

08:32.713 --> 08:33.557
have room for you. We can keep you there. He did 
everything possible for me. I knew I couldn't stay

08:36.290 --> 08:39.042
in the dorm. get an apartment, get a job, and so 
that's what I did. I mean, that was a change in my

08:41.930 --> 08:43.973
life. But you stayed with the team through the 
spring semester. And we, you know, I think we won

08:47.718 --> 08:51.163
half our games. I mean, it wasn't a great team. And 
you were pitching. I was still a pitcher. Did you

08:56.730 --> 09:02.017
all make any important trip that you remember with 
the team that year? We saw Tom Chandler get thrown

09:02.077 --> 09:06.683
out of three games in Tech at UT. We had a triple 
header, we had to play two games on Saturday, or one

09:07.405 --> 09:12.312
game on Friday and two games on Saturday. He got 
thrown out of every game. It was a remarkable.

09:15.957 --> 09:16.898
That's unusual. Yeah, he was not happy that we did. 
And I think we were pretty close to tied for the

09:21.325 --> 09:26.993
season with him. And he really thought we got home 
town. And most people don't remember that field

09:30.698 --> 09:36.366
where they had the big cliffs in center field and 
everybody's They knew how to do it. We didn't. Of

09:38.642 --> 09:41.767
course, it was a long weekend. It was a long ride 
home, I can tell you. When you all went on an

09:43.890 --> 09:46.333
out-of-town trip, how did you go? By bus. And the 
whole team on the bus? The whole team on the bus.

09:50.179 --> 09:51.581
What did you all do on that bus? Oh, listen to Tom 
Chandler tell stories, mostly. The guys in the

09:55.448 --> 09:58.672
back would play cards and talk, but I was young. I 
enjoyed it. What stories about what? All the old

10:01.977 --> 10:03.039
ball players. He could tell stories about my 
brother and

10:04.420 --> 10:12.692
some of the guys that played with my brother. He 
says one time

10:12.772 --> 10:24.949
they were going to a game and the bus broke down and 
my brother and I can't remember his name, got out of

10:25.520 --> 10:28.324
the bus. They couldn't wave anybody down to stop, 
so they went up the highway a little bit and

10:28.364 --> 10:37.815
pretended, when cars come in, they pretended they 
were pulling a cable across the road. The car comes

10:37.836 --> 10:45.385
to a screeching halt, went off the road in the bar 
ditch, and of course, My brother and his buddy are

10:45.888 --> 10:51.438
running back to the bus, and Tom Chandler's out 
there, what's going on? What did you do? Did you

10:52.440 --> 10:54.563
cause this person to? No, Coach, we didn't do it. We 
didn't do it. But those are the kind of stories he

10:57.408 --> 11:01.516
would tell about the previous players. And of 
course, he'd pick one or two guys that were on the

11:01.556 --> 11:10.191
team, and he'd start telling stories about the 
older guys and what they did and how they pitched

11:01.556 --> 11:10.191
the game. He was an excellent, excellent 
storyteller, and that's really what I enjoyed on

11:10.795 --> 11:16.362
that couple trips. So no mischief on the bus? No, I 
mean, you know, a little bit of razzing. You know, I

11:22.070 --> 11:27.236
had a couple of guys end up playing baseball in the 
back end with a sock and stuff like that, but

11:22.070 --> 11:27.236
nothing. Where did you all stay on the road? 
Usually at a Ramada Inn or whatever. I can't even

11:32.699 --> 11:34.420
remember the place in Austin. Was life pretty 
tame? Oh, yeah. I mean, we'd stay up until he'd come

11:37.964 --> 11:41.847
and not rap it on the doors. What did you all know the 
rules really were about behavior? Well, we all

11:45.850 --> 11:47.011
dressed right. That was one thing, coat and tie. We 
didn't touch the room. We slept in the room and we

11:53.577 --> 11:56.179
took a bath in the room. That was one of the rules. He 
was not paying for any furniture or any TVs or

11:58.221 --> 12:02.605
anything like that. And you really you took took 
you know, he made you take pride in who you were your

12:03.682 --> 12:13.994
Aggies and you know How did he how did he encourage 
that? I think the older players and basically it

12:15.776 --> 12:29.571
just just like, you know, I'd say just like in the 
core But I mean the older guys say hey, this is what

12:15.776 --> 12:29.571
you do, you know, I mean he didn't have to do 
anything But you know the senior players you

12:15.776 --> 12:29.571
usually would would say hey, you know, this is 
what? We're going here, we're going there. They

12:31.244 --> 12:32.887
basically lead the team. Did anybody say anything 
about hair length and mustaches? Oh, absolutely.

12:36.814 --> 12:37.395
There was none. There was none. You got a short 
haircut, no mustaches, no face hair, none of that.

12:43.206 --> 12:44.328
You shaved every day. You had a clean appearance. 
Then at the end of that spring semester, you

12:48.637 --> 12:55.863
decide, or did you decide that spring? I decided 
that spring about halfway through. I knew I was not

12:58.546 --> 13:00.367
going to make two classes. You know, I was not going 
to pass them. So it was, I was skull pro that next

13:02.049 --> 13:07.333
year. And you go, and you and Coach Chandler have a 
good chat. Excellent chat. He understands. Did he

13:13.178 --> 13:14.539
give you any advice? Yeah, he says I need to make 
class more often. which he knew I was not. So he

13:19.753 --> 13:22.477
says, if you just make your classes, you'll pass. 
He says, but you don't make your classes, you're

13:22.537 --> 13:24.900
not going to go through. So he says, you just got to 
make your classes. So that was his advice. What did

13:30.868 --> 13:32.069
mom and dad say? My dad was convinced I was not going 
back to A&M. He thought he would have a permanent

13:36.055 --> 13:40.220
employee there in El Paso. And I went and talked to 
my counselor. Was that Priestmeyer or somebody

13:42.232 --> 13:45.595
else? This was in the architecture department. I 
remember who it was. I went in and I talked to them,

13:48.558 --> 13:53.923
and they said, no, well, you basically flunked out 
of school. I said, you've got three passing

13:53.943 --> 13:59.328
classes and two playing classes, and the other 
grades aren't going to keep you in architecture. I

13:59.388 --> 14:01.290
said, well, this is why. I was playing baseball, 
all the situation. They said, well, you need to

14:04.894 --> 14:08.357
take this class again, another class at summer 
school, take it. He says, we'll put you on

14:09.569 --> 14:13.014
scholastic probation in the fall. And I came back, 
and I got an apartment with a ballplayer who had

14:14.295 --> 14:22.246
finished out his eligibility, needed somebody to 
live with for a year. And

14:23.348 --> 14:29.316
so I lived with him. My grades went up, I started 
working, I got a job. With whom? Uh, D&B Oil

14:33.883 --> 14:35.845
Company, Dick Broach. How did you locate that job? 
Well, as I said, my brother was good friends with

14:38.208 --> 14:42.974
the Daces, which I became good friends with. Oh, 
okay. And they became good, they were good friends

14:43.195 --> 14:52.226
with Dick and Bill Broach, who had two young boys, 
and they needed kind of a permanent babysitter for

14:43.195 --> 14:52.226
two wild Indian kids. And I was perfect, I was big, 
they knew I would not put up with it. I babysat with

14:57.224 --> 15:02.653
him several times, and actually Bill said, would 
you like a job? He says, would you be interested in

15:02.693 --> 15:04.817
working for us? And I said, sure. So I started 
working with their filling stations for a while,

15:05.578 --> 15:11.588
and then I started driving a tanker truck for them. 
I was making good money driving a tanker truck.

15:13.411 --> 15:16.296
About how many hours a week was that job? Probably 
20, 25 is all. Do you remember what the pay was? I got

15:20.963 --> 15:21.865
paid good money. I was around $10 an hour. because I 
was driving that tanker. Oh, that was good money

15:25.288 --> 15:26.371
then. Well, I was half of what you have to pay 
somebody else. Yeah, but still. He was getting a

15:29.299 --> 15:30.161
good deal. No, I made, I was doing, I was okay. I 
didn't need any money from my dad for spending, so.

15:35.837 --> 15:36.900
You still didn't have a car? I finally got a car. My 
junior year I got a car. In fact, my father-in-law

15:39.912 --> 15:43.397
financed the car, so I was able to afford it. But you 
were not yet married? I was not yet married to my

15:44.379 --> 15:46.463
future father-in-law. He thought I needed a car. 
And that young lady had stayed with you and she had

15:48.125 --> 15:52.292
put up with the – Oh, yeah. She stuck around. All 
right. And so that junior year, how was it

15:55.337 --> 16:01.167
different from the first two years? I was much more 
stable. I was much more comfortable in the, you

16:03.472 --> 16:07.278
know, I was much more comfortable in an apartment. 
I knew I didn't have the baseball over my head. I

16:10.342 --> 16:11.864
didn't have to go work out. The job was easier. I 
worked all my life, so the job was easier to handle

16:13.627 --> 16:17.212
than baseball. And I was getting more 
comfortable. Larry Priesmeier and I had become

16:22.291 --> 16:32.143
pretty good friends, so I was much more 
comfortable, and he really guided me in what I

16:22.291 --> 16:32.143
needed to do to get out of college, and that's what 
his purpose was. Now, when you got that car, you

16:32.464 --> 16:35.988
didn't play around much more. No, I went to work and 
went home, went to school. I mean, that's

16:39.993 --> 16:42.917
literally, I went to Austin a couple times. I 
couldn't, you know, you really, I don't

16:43.938 --> 16:50.526
say you couldn't afford to, but I enjoyed what I was 
doing. We'd go to the lake, go to Somerville on the

16:52.269 --> 17:02.467
weekends with friends and go to the Lakeview Club 
once or twice a week. I mean, I was happy with that.

17:04.350 --> 17:06.574
It was very simple as far as Did you ever go to one of 
the drinking parties at the clay pits? Never did. I

17:14.807 --> 17:15.768
keep looking. Nobody that I know of. Claims. No, 
no. Yeah, I went, but they don't remember exactly

17:18.993 --> 17:22.878
where it was. Some were south and west.

17:27.985 --> 17:36.196
During that time, while you were an 
undergraduate, were you aware of any secret

17:27.985 --> 17:36.196
fraternities at Texas A&M? None. Didn't know a 
thing. Let's see, did you ever have, did you ever go

17:40.152 --> 17:46.542
to any of the big fancy dances on campus? Never did. 
Never had a date, I mean on campus. The dates were

17:51.631 --> 17:53.614
always in Austin. You didn't have any Tessie 
dates? No. Student indulgences, alcohol, what

17:57.961 --> 18:01.247
kind of alcohol? Just beer. What was the favorite 
brands? Well, we used to drink Texas pride because

18:04.300 --> 18:22.138
it was the cheapest let alone star and then of 
course when I was when somebody else is buying I

18:04.300 --> 18:22.138
have a scotch, but usually it's you know, when you 
buy your own you have just a beer and What were

18:04.300 --> 18:22.138
people smoking? Well with you know, that was when 
marijuana really got popular I mean and I never did

18:24.060 --> 18:32.569
it can actually say I never tried it But the 
architecture department, it was very popular.

18:36.831 --> 18:44.766
Now they were the liberals and they, you know, 
they- Did they buy it in Brazos County or did they

18:36.831 --> 18:44.766
bring it- They brought it with them usually. From 
Houston- From their homes, you know, where they

18:45.147 --> 18:49.495
knew they could get it. There was quite a few of the 
architecture students back then that smoked. Was

18:54.562 --> 19:00.652
there any, did you all even know about anything 
like heroin or anything like that in the early 70s?

19:00.672 --> 19:07.504
I did because I came from El Paso and in an 
environment of being in the border it was very easy

19:00.672 --> 19:07.504
to get access. A lot of my friends accessed all that 
stuff. I saw several of them die. And that's why I

19:14.180 --> 19:18.926
like College Station and Bryan so well is I never 
saw any of that. I never felt it around like I did in

19:18.966 --> 19:23.072
El Paso. So I guess that's one of the things that 
attracted me to like it so much. Were you aware that

19:27.718 --> 19:31.603
there were any dealers of any illegals? No, not at 
all. I don't think they would have lasted a day or

19:34.006 --> 19:36.469
two. In your student days, could whiskey be bought 
legally in Brazos County? I think so. I thought it

19:45.989 --> 19:46.870
could be. I can't remember buying beer and never 
being carded, because it was pretty much, I think

19:48.331 --> 19:55.258
it was 18 and 0, because they passed that law. So I 
don't remember ever having a problem buying

19:55.278 --> 19:59.461
anything really to drink. Did you ever hear 
anybody talk about going to the chicken ranch? Oh,

20:03.445 --> 20:03.865
yeah. In LaGrange? Oh, yeah. Really? What did they 
say about the chicken ranch? Well, my roommate

20:06.708 --> 20:13.414
used to go there probably once a month, the old 
ballpark. And

20:14.305 --> 20:21.495
he'd get all excited because he had his money saved 
up and he could go over there. And I'd catch him the

20:21.515 --> 20:25.500
next morning and go, oh, I met this new girl. It was 
just, you know, he was funny. He was quite a

20:28.764 --> 20:30.326
character. Did the stories you heard from him, 
were they similar to the... Oh, the Alto, yeah. I

20:37.956 --> 20:41.281
mean, half the baseball team regularly went over 
there. So, yeah, and of course... There were some

20:43.583 --> 20:48.338
guys from Austin that, of course, the people from 
Austin didn't go to LaGrange. They went to Seeley.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.056
LaGrange was for the Aggies. But that's kind of the 
stories we heard. And if on a Saturday night, if you

20:58.214 --> 21:08.790
and a group of friends were going to have a good 
time, you went out to the Lakeview Club. Lakeview

21:08.810 --> 21:10.853
Club, mostly. And at Northgate, was there 
anything else, North or Southgate? None. How

21:17.403 --> 21:18.585
often did you go to Houston? Well, see, that was the 
difference, I think, in school now and school

21:19.346 --> 21:23.733
then. I think everybody abandoned that campus and 
went to football games. Nobody went to basketball

21:26.834 --> 21:31.459
games unless they were, you know, student 
athletes. So most of the people went to Houston or

21:31.479 --> 21:35.443
Dallas. In Dallas, everybody had to become a 
member of a club, you know, to drink. So, you know,

21:39.307 --> 21:44.292
that was the, we'd go up there and join a club so we 
can go in and have dinner and drink. But I think most

21:44.372 --> 21:53.161
of the drinking was done back at home for most of the 
students in the places they usually went to. And I

21:53.181 --> 21:55.744
went to, you know, whoever took me, I went to their 
local, you know, we're going to go to this club and

21:56.467 --> 22:00.853
dance and stuff. In terms of student body, one of 
the items that I missed, integration, how were

22:00.953 --> 22:05.819
blacks treated?

22:09.724 --> 22:10.985
The ones I knew were athletes. You know, everybody 
was kind of treated equally. Otherwise, I didn't,

22:13.429 --> 22:18.094
I mean, in the architecture department, there may 
have been one or two. Everybody just kind of

22:18.575 --> 22:20.157
treated them the same. I know there was some racist 
stuff going on at the time, some, you know, what are

22:25.306 --> 22:27.968
they doing here, you know, that kind of stuff. But 
it really, it was so minor and so limited that it was

22:27.988 --> 22:36.816
just an individual or two that created that kind of 
thing. Did you go off campus much to shop, to buy

22:38.718 --> 22:43.742
clothes or anything else? Oh, yeah. I used to go, I 
mean, my favorite was to go downtown Bryan. You

22:47.886 --> 22:52.130
know, that place was really pretty popular and we 
used to go down there to the shops and stores.

22:53.891 --> 22:54.992
Where'd you go to the movie? Well, the movie 
theater right there at Northgate was the campus.

23:01.454 --> 23:07.944
And, of course, every Saturday night they had the 
stag films that we used to go to. And how did Aggies

23:08.505 --> 23:12.772
behave during campus theater movies? Oh, it was a 
riot. I mean, every remark that could be made was

23:14.254 --> 23:16.798
made. I mean, you couldn't insult anybody. Nobody 
brought a date. I mean, you're all just pretty much

23:20.203 --> 23:21.705
there. entertaining on Thursday night or 
Wednesday night when they come out with the new

23:22.090 --> 23:25.488
movie. I mean, everybody was just there to raise 
hell, so. It was just the great remarks. And your

23:30.950 --> 23:38.381
junior and senior years you, again, didn't go home 
except at the holiday time. Right. Do you remember

23:40.203 --> 23:49.056
any national or international event during your 
A&M years where you, it so startled you, you

23:40.203 --> 23:49.056
remember where you were when you heard the news? 
Nothing like that? Nothing like that. It was, you

23:50.939 --> 23:52.921
know, the Vietnam War was gone. It was startling 
everybody. Nothing like September 11? Nothing

23:55.525 --> 23:56.366
like that. All right. Vietnam. How much did you and 
your buddies talk about that? A lot, because a lot

23:59.671 --> 24:02.356
of them were gone. I mean, my number was, I was the 
last year that they allowed college deferments,

24:02.457 --> 24:09.390
and my number was 76. So, you know, if I didn't stay 
in school, I was going to be gone. And, of course,

24:15.002 --> 24:19.671
all the guys in the Corps, we talked to them, and, 
you know, they're going to be, they knew they were

24:20.309 --> 24:23.994
going to be going if the thing didn't come to an end 
real quick. So it was some consternation there. I

24:26.658 --> 24:27.860
mean everybody was. What did you and your civilian 
student friends think about the corps? I

24:35.010 --> 24:39.617
don't know. Most of them admired them. Most of them 
said, hey, I couldn't do that. You know, most of

24:42.240 --> 24:46.907
them were, you know, these guys are hardcore.

24:49.233 --> 24:50.755
Again, I'm from El Paso. You have Fort Bliss. I live 
two blocks from Fort Bliss. I was around military

24:53.280 --> 24:55.122
every day, all day. They were my school, you know. 
So it wasn't that much different other than, for

24:56.585 --> 25:04.498
me, I don't think I could have handled the 
discipline. I was too undisciplined and wasn't

25:04.518 --> 25:07.863
regimented. I mean, I probably should have done 
it. It would have probably been better for me to get

25:09.706 --> 25:12.891
me more organized. The guys I knew You know, they 
loved it. They thought it was, you know, and they,

25:16.919 --> 25:22.127
you know, like I said, they'd come over to us to 
complain, but they always went back. And you

25:22.808 --> 25:26.494
didn't, you and your buddies didn't necessarily 
look down on them. It was just different than. Oh,

25:27.977 --> 25:28.518
not at all. We used to go watch them march. We used 
to, you know, I mean, there was a lot of, I mean,

25:29.900 --> 25:40.637
there was, I don't know, five or six thousand in the 
Corps, and more than that, really eight, I think it

25:29.900 --> 25:40.637
was, when I was in my freshman year. And we'd go over 
to, at the MSC, you know the, what's that field, I

25:40.921 --> 25:48.273
can't think of it. The drill field. The drill 
field. Simpson. Simpson. And we'd all watch them

25:51.838 --> 25:55.664
march and we thought, man, that's, you know, 
that's a good bull. I mean, we really did. We

25:56.866 --> 25:57.567
enjoyed it. We supported it. You know, we were 
there, so. Did you go to Aggie Muster while you were

26:00.753 --> 26:03.637
a student? Never went to Aggie Muster. But you went 
to, did you go to Yale practice? Yeah, I went to Yale

26:10.832 --> 26:12.654
practice. Every year, every game. And you went to 
football games. Actually, I worked, the first two

26:16.278 --> 26:28.071
years I was playing baseball, I went to the 
football games, and then I got a job with Coke, so I

26:16.278 --> 26:28.071
was down at the wood pasture, or whatever his name 
is. You know, we'd service all the Coke machines

26:28.911 --> 26:31.855
and everything else. So I was working the football 
and the basketball games. I worked all of them.

26:37.132 --> 26:41.338
What is it that pulls A&M people together? What 
builds that spirit, that feeling? I think we're

26:45.584 --> 26:52.494
all there for one purpose, to get that degree from 
Texas A&M. I know I was there for that reason. I

26:54.577 --> 26:58.863
admired my best friend's dad for what he had. I 
never saw that from any other you know, older

27:04.503 --> 27:06.706
people had college degrees. They were never, let 
me show you this stuff about A&M. Let me show you, I

27:10.690 --> 27:19.961
mean, you're always, you know, I don't want to say 
indoctrinated, but you're always in awe of how

27:10.690 --> 27:19.961
proud they were of the degree. And I think, I think 
the old Army, you know, when everybody was in the

27:20.041 --> 27:27.850
Corps and had that camaraderie, I think it was, it 
was that that started it. And I think now it's gone,

27:28.631 --> 27:32.856
you know, past that, like for me, I mean, Look at the 
picture of my son. He's two years old. He's got

27:35.414 --> 27:36.154
boots on. He's got Texas Aggies. He applied to one 
school. And I think that's what keeps people going

27:40.538 --> 27:47.224
back is because you don't look at anything else. 
You want that for your son. I mean, that's why I

27:48.805 --> 27:52.848
think it is. It's such a family. Like as I look on 
your wall, I see things that I think are very

27:54.750 --> 28:03.197
normal. Yeah, see, Olsen Field, as a sidebar, if 
Tom was alive today, he'd tell you this. He told

28:09.403 --> 28:14.110
this to my son and several people. That was my 
fourth year architecture project. Really? Olsen

28:18.096 --> 28:18.677
Field. Oh, talk about that. I got with Coach 
Chandler. I said, Coach, I got a project. I need to

28:24.066 --> 28:25.849
do a project for my fourth year. And I said, I want to 
do a new baseball stadium for A&M. He said, we need a

28:29.274 --> 28:30.416
new stadium. Oh, man. He lit up. He brought in two 
grass experts. He brought in people from the

28:37.584 --> 28:41.190
Astros. And Larry Priestmeyer helped me do this. 
And like I said, I was a builder. So we did

28:46.758 --> 28:48.661
schematics. We did a four by four model with lights 
and all the baseball field. I mean, it was

28:55.010 --> 28:58.615
literally, I wish I had my pictures of it. I've lost 
them in the move. That's what it was. that design

29:01.970 --> 29:05.814
was almost identical to what they picked. And we 
had it over a skylight, you know, had glass over it,

29:05.834 --> 29:14.542
and we, I presented it to my class and Dean Romnick 
and everything else, and of course. Are you the one

29:14.562 --> 29:19.007
that came up with the idea that your project would 
be a baseball stadium? Mm-hmm. Okay. That's what I

29:19.948 --> 29:20.889
wanted to do. I mean, I wanted to do it for Coach 
Chandler. Now, where did you propose that it be

29:23.351 --> 29:26.014
located? Exactly where it's located. Okay. I 
mean, it wasn't my idea. It was Tom's idea. He said,

29:30.289 --> 29:34.195
we need to put that thing, we need to start on the 
other side. We want the baseball field on the other

29:34.215 --> 29:37.440
side of those railroad tracks. And we want it to 
stand out. We want it to be, you know, the, you know,

29:38.762 --> 29:45.633
and before it was just the old, there used to be the 
old riding stables was where that thing was. So we

29:46.714 --> 29:54.066
presented it to our class in the architecture 
department and got an A on it. And Tom helped a lot. I

29:56.143 --> 29:58.266
mean, he really, his input was on that field. He 
said, we need this and we need that. We need these

29:59.887 --> 30:01.109
things over here. So it was a complete facility, 
batting cages and pitching things. And then we

30:05.073 --> 30:09.037
presented it to the Letterman's Association. We 
took it to the Letterman's Association. Tom said,

30:11.119 --> 30:14.022
you know, this is what we're presenting to you. Oh, 
they loved it. So let's put it in the lounge and

30:15.243 --> 30:19.147
let's sit it up there for the spring. And so we put 
that thing in the Letterman's Lounge. It stayed

30:22.271 --> 30:24.593
there until it got gray, I think, green fabric got 
gray for the field. And from what Tom tells me,

30:28.236 --> 30:35.586
Olsen walked in after one of the football games or 
something and said, what's this? So this is the

30:36.808 --> 30:43.017
new, this is our idea of maybe doing a new football 
stadium, or a new baseball stadium. He says, well,

30:43.037 --> 30:44.138
what's it going to cost? And I had a complete bill, 
how much it was going to cost to build, and I had all

30:44.158 --> 30:49.906
the estimates and everything. He says, well, I'll 
put up half if you put up half. Do you remember what

30:54.678 --> 30:57.841
the number was at your estimate? I can't even 
remember back then. It was, you know, not over

31:00.603 --> 31:03.626
three or four million. It was not in the numbers 
that it came in at, but it was significantly later

31:03.646 --> 31:11.594
that they really built it. Right, and so the year 
you're designing it is 70? 72.

31:17.859 --> 31:24.145
And Mr. Olson indicates that he will make a big 
contribution about when? A few years later,

31:25.053 --> 31:27.638
because that thing stayed in there a couple of 
years. Okay. So it was a couple of years later when

31:28.660 --> 31:30.924
he came in. And the only condition, he said, 
there's only one condition, if you know the story,

31:31.245 --> 31:38.780
that I get to park my motorhome. We're going to put 
motorhome slots over here, and I'm parking my

31:38.800 --> 31:43.368
motorhome right there for the football games. 
That was the condition of part of the baseball

31:43.429 --> 31:46.234
stadium. Where was Mr. Olson living then, do you 
know? In Houston. In Houston, okay. He had not yet

31:50.210 --> 31:51.432
moved up to? No. His house just sold. Do you 
remember where he lived due south of the campus?

31:59.425 --> 32:02.090
Well, he lived about two blocks due south of the 
campus. He went straight out by the President's

32:02.130 --> 32:06.197
house and kept going.
