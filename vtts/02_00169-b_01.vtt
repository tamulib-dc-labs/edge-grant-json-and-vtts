00:02.410 --> 00:22.917
The theoretical training that I'd gotten in as part of public administration courses I took, business management courses, my military, limited military experience and so forth, taught me the, or I felt, pointed to the advantages of having a single line of supervision.

00:23.487 --> 00:27.975
At one time, the Extension Service had four lines of supervision leading to each county.

00:29.037 --> 00:34.407
And we had a separate black, but it was agriculture had its own line of supervision, home economics had its own, and then you had it.

00:34.928 --> 00:38.574
So you had four people in a county, they'd have four different bosses.

00:39.837 --> 00:45.006
And I didn't think that was, because we had, we were completely dependent on the

00:46.572 --> 00:51.323
voluntary cooperation of people to work together at the local level.

00:51.403 --> 01:03.670
I mean, if you had a county extension agent in agriculture and a county extension agent in home economics that didn't like each other or didn't, you know, couldn't work together, there were problems.

01:04.223 --> 01:30.636
But I knew that this was going to be difficult to bring about, so we appointed a large task force headed by one of our agronomists, a very fine fellow, and we had the people look at this and look at other states and came up with what they finally led to a single line of supervision.

01:31.409 --> 01:39.726
But we made sure that the best qualified people were put in the supervising or lead positions, and these could be men or women.

01:40.728 --> 01:45.338
And as it happened, many men had wound up with women supervisors and vice versa.

01:45.679 --> 01:48.304
It was more acceptable in the other direction.

01:48.385 --> 02:03.062
There was considerable resentment, I think, in some of the field positions to have women lead, well, the argument was they don't know anything about agriculture and how can, but, you know, supervision is not about knowing programs, it's about, you know, knowing people and seeing what they get done.

02:03.602 --> 02:16.317
But anyway, I felt it made the organization extremely more effective because we had one person at the county level, we didn't use a high, we just called him a chairman, you know, somebody

02:16.297 --> 02:19.803
to provide leadership at the, you know, you had to deal with the county commissioners.

02:19.863 --> 02:24.352
Unfortunate to have four people going to the county commissioners pleading for this, that, and the other.

02:24.392 --> 02:30.984
This way you only had one person and, you know, employing secretaries and running the office and all of these type of things.

02:31.685 --> 02:38.457
So I felt that was one of my big accomplishments in terms of the organization.

02:39.010 --> 02:58.210
There was still the continued pressure on the part of department heads to have more control over extension specialists, which I guess because I had been so steeped in the history that we had experienced whenever we tried it, it always seemed that public service or extension came out last.

02:59.311 --> 03:04.056
If you had joint appointees with faculty members, particularly younger faculty members,

03:04.610 --> 03:15.110
No matter what you might say, their objective is to get published, do research, get publications out so they can get their tenure and their promotions and so forth.

03:15.130 --> 03:24.829
And, you know, even if they were a 50% extension, it was at least at that stage of their career, and often when they had these things behind them, it could change.

03:25.383 --> 03:42.551
We had, we felt we had a responsibility, Dr. Hutchison and I did, that if we, if we, you know, if we had a 40%, 50% appointment or whatever, that we expected that much performance, you know, or time allocation.

03:42.792 --> 03:47.519
You know, you can't measure it accurately, but, you know, we expected performance.

03:47.539 --> 03:50.344
We'd get many complaints from the field of people who,

03:51.151 --> 03:57.621
were unapproachable for help, you know, because they were too wrapped up in their research or their teaching responsibilities and so forth.

03:57.641 --> 04:00.685
Anyway, that, you know, is a stress to this day, I suppose.

04:00.885 --> 04:11.601
It continues to be, but that was one of the problems I had to deal with and we, but as I said, I felt that wasn't a common.

04:11.621 --> 04:20.314
We continued to have good experiences with, I guess, until the year I left, we enjoyed continuing

04:21.172 --> 04:24.897
good support from both the federal level and the state level.

04:25.759 --> 04:31.347
But you know, economic difficulties started in the early 80s and things went down after that in terms of resources.

04:31.607 --> 04:36.133
In fact, I guess after I was director, they started having to eliminate positions.

04:36.193 --> 04:45.347
And I think over the last, however long that's been, they've probably lost 300 positions in terms of, they just simply wouldn't get it.

04:45.827 --> 04:49.913
Either at the federal level or at the state level, we're getting any increases.

04:50.180 --> 05:04.442
in terms of funds, but they were expected to provide, you had to give salary increases to stay competitive, so the only thing you could do is, as positions became a vacant, they had to be eliminated, and that's still, unfortunately, what's happening.

05:04.625 --> 05:15.378
Am I correct that at the state and national political level, many urban politicians looked upon the agriculture extension service as country, rural?

05:15.438 --> 05:16.099
Yeah.

05:16.219 --> 05:29.376
And see, the reality is now, as you know, they're less than 2% of the population is actually bona fide, what we call bona fide, at least getting 50% or more of the income.

05:30.617 --> 05:34.362
Because in most counties, I mean, people that are still farmers,

05:35.438 --> 05:38.983
nearly all of them have off-farm employment or their wives work off the farm.

05:39.284 --> 05:44.111
They want to pay for their land and so forth and they can't do it from the production of it.

05:44.131 --> 05:52.603
And of course you've had this continuous, I know for example, what we call industrialization that happened in the poultry industry.

05:53.461 --> 05:56.707
three or four or six, maybe six operators in all of Texas.

05:56.767 --> 05:57.910
They control the whole thing.

05:57.950 --> 06:00.936
There are no small chicken farmers anymore.

06:00.956 --> 06:06.006
I mean, you might see people keep a few just for organic type things and so forth.

06:06.026 --> 06:12.398
All right, as you created the staff, who were the key staff members during your period of leadership?

06:13.340 --> 06:19.506
Well, one of the person that served as my associate director, Joe Rode.

06:20.166 --> 06:20.887
I spelled Rode.

06:21.227 --> 06:22.228
R-O-T-H-E.

06:23.349 --> 06:36.240
He was made associate director and he was, he played on the famous 39 team, had a game leg because of it, played side by side with Kimbrough.

06:36.261 --> 06:41.305
Anyway, he was a very fine person and I tried to,

06:42.770 --> 06:56.013
above an operation like I had, you know, experienced, like I called it the Mr. Outside and Mr. Inside and looked to him to run the organization and I'd do the outside contacts, the university.

06:57.115 --> 07:00.021
There was a lot of activity, always is, at the federal level.

07:00.101 --> 07:03.647
I mean, we had to go to Washington frequently for appropriations here.

07:05.045 --> 07:08.631
Sometimes much as a month, once a month or even oftener.

07:09.252 --> 07:14.321
And then we were often, in the land grant association, there were various committees that you served on and so forth.

07:14.982 --> 07:16.285
You had to spend a lot of time on the road.

07:16.345 --> 07:17.867
Not a good time to have a family.

07:19.671 --> 07:26.242
About Monday through Friday, about how many, what percentage of the time were you out of town?

07:26.843 --> 07:27.845
Half?

07:27.865 --> 07:29.668
As Dr. Hutchison's wife once said,

07:30.577 --> 07:34.804
When he does come home, he upsets the routine.

07:36.326 --> 07:37.348
More than half, I'd say.

07:37.849 --> 07:38.409
It's varied.

07:39.311 --> 07:54.475
And, of course, I was stubborn enough to try to hang on to my military activities, which was stressful, too, because you had to meet, you know, once a weekend there and had to go to two weeks military camp in the summer.

07:54.927 --> 07:56.729
We hardly ever took a family vacation.

07:56.749 --> 07:57.711
We just couldn't work it in.

07:58.131 --> 08:04.079
The only vacation we had at a family, I guess, was in connection with some of my assignments, committee assignments.

08:04.099 --> 08:08.364
We'd have a meeting in Fort Collins, you know, maybe take the family along.

08:08.384 --> 08:11.909
At least they could do some sightseeing while I was in the meeting and so forth.

08:13.551 --> 08:19.198
Who were your, nationally, who, what colleagues did you enjoy working with most?

08:19.859 --> 08:20.800
Nationally?

08:21.539 --> 08:22.680
other directors or?

08:23.041 --> 08:26.485
Well, yeah, I was mainly collectivity with among the directors.

08:26.505 --> 08:29.548
You must have had two or three that were closest, closer friends.

08:29.568 --> 08:40.621
Yeah, one of the things that most people don't recognize in appointing a director is that the law states us that the university, the land grant university makes the selection, but it has to have the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture.

08:41.482 --> 08:51.034
And they may have abandoned it, but you had to have a formal interview with the Secretary of Agriculture who was Earl Butts when I, under the, I guess it was the Nixon days.

08:51.054 --> 08:51.394
Yeah.

08:51.610 --> 08:54.697
Do you remember what he asked about China Devils?

08:54.998 --> 08:58.105
No, but that was about the time he'd gotten into difficulty.

08:58.145 --> 08:58.626
You remember?

08:58.666 --> 09:06.784
He had, he was overheard making a racial joke in the back of a plane one time, and somebody picked that up.

09:06.950 --> 09:08.192
I think it caused this.

09:08.633 --> 09:12.421
Was it, as you recall, was it really an interview or just a conversation?

09:12.441 --> 09:14.545
Oh, it was, it's a pro forma thing.

09:14.906 --> 09:15.848
I mean, I don't know.

09:15.868 --> 09:16.469
About how long?

09:17.230 --> 09:21.038
10 minutes, 15 at the most.

09:21.118 --> 09:22.220
You know, it was impressive.

09:22.280 --> 09:26.629
I mean, it made you think that your position was important there.

09:27.672 --> 09:32.417
Let's see, other than Dr. Rodick, what other key staff members did you like?

09:32.437 --> 09:36.662
Well, Dr. Black, I mentioned earlier, Delbert Black came to us from Oklahoma.

09:37.563 --> 09:38.164
I brought him in.

09:38.224 --> 09:46.113
He actually had a poultry background, but he got his degree in adult education, and they didn't have a home for him in Oklahoma State.

09:46.173 --> 09:54.102
And he came, and we were just beginning to expand our community development programs, and he seemed to be an extremely desirable person.

09:54.824 --> 10:02.398
And we assigned him to leadership in that area, but I don't think he was particularly happy in that because he was an action person.

10:03.560 --> 10:10.453
And we found out soon later on as we got into these personnel problems while I was still associate director that he would

10:11.969 --> 10:15.414
could serve a much more effective role in being personnel officer.

10:16.095 --> 10:17.678
And he was very, very helpful to me.

10:17.698 --> 10:27.533
I, you know, he took the time and had the intellectual ability to get, to work with our statistics department.

10:27.814 --> 10:40.373
Forget one of the, the guy who's, he was different than everybody else in the statistics department, but he really was able to utilize

10:41.838 --> 10:47.267
the statistical approaches, applying it to a real world situation than anybody ever saw.

10:47.368 --> 10:48.389
I wish I could remember his name.

10:48.429 --> 10:58.547
But he and Dr. Black actually slept together for weeks and weeks at a time because they worked out all of these regression things in the salary areas and all of that.

10:58.966 --> 11:01.149
But Dr. Black was extremely helpful to me.

11:02.270 --> 11:08.678
There was a gentleman that I brought in as assistant to the director named Vernon Pellet, who is no longer living.

11:09.039 --> 11:09.560
P-E?

11:09.820 --> 11:12.403
P-E-L-L-E-T, I think.

11:12.423 --> 11:23.858
He had come from Wisconsin and was a, you know, and I made him, or he became assistant director for finances and this type of thing and helped with the budgets.

11:24.458 --> 11:28.804
He was an extremely effective person.

11:30.472 --> 11:33.857
We had a very fine administrative staff.

11:34.017 --> 11:38.323
We had about eight people, I guess eight or nine people.

11:38.343 --> 11:43.871
We included in that the head of the agriculture communications office.

11:43.911 --> 11:51.221
We had, of course, the state home economics leader, the state program leaders, and the supervisors of specialists, and so forth.

11:51.902 --> 11:54.165
And I tried to have a collegial style.

11:54.226 --> 11:55.247
We met every week.

11:55.717 --> 12:02.467
at least an hour or two on a designated time with an agenda to make sure that we were coordinated and operated.

12:03.588 --> 12:07.554
It was a very happy situation in working with that group.

12:08.896 --> 12:15.565
About how many statewide, about what was the personnel total for?

12:16.658 --> 12:29.139
At that time, I would say we probably had about 750, 800 people working at the county level, and then another 350, 400 working at the area and state level.

12:29.219 --> 12:29.861
So maybe 1,200?

12:29.881 --> 12:33.387
1,100, I think is the figure we usually say, about 1,100 professionals.

12:34.108 --> 12:40.118
Then, of course, we started adding paraprofessionals, particularly in the foods and nutrition program.

12:40.672 --> 12:46.441
And if you, you know, accounted for secretaries, everybody that was on our budget, it got up to about 2,500 people.

12:47.302 --> 12:50.907
And we had a pretty good, pretty sizable budget in terms of operating.

12:51.649 --> 13:03.066
And it's an interesting mix because you, as I had, one time had an auditor with me, one time a visit from Washington, and we were audited, you know, from all directions.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.793
It happened that, you know, we get the federal funds,

13:08.195 --> 13:12.419
The federal fiscal year has changed, but it's October to September now.

13:12.980 --> 13:16.503
The state fiscal year is September through August.

13:16.943 --> 13:18.545
The counties work on a calendar year.

13:18.985 --> 13:24.411
They said, I don't see how anybody can develop a budget when you have three different calendars, but we somehow manage.

13:24.431 --> 13:31.898
But it was an extra challenge because you had to revamp everything in terms of your state budget and your national budget and everything else.

13:31.938 --> 13:35.181
Did Dr. Adkisson give you any directions?

13:36.072 --> 13:36.735
Not too much.

13:36.855 --> 13:37.337
Guidelines?

13:37.357 --> 13:38.341
No.

13:38.562 --> 13:42.678
He was very much, you know, he had a particular program.

13:42.718 --> 13:46.673
Well, that was one of the programs that started with Dr. Hutchison, but it was a national program.

13:47.092 --> 14:13.487
That I had mentioned earlier before that was extremely successful, the pest, what do they call it, pest management program where, you know, with the environmental concerns came out that we, you know, we knew we had to start working with farmers to get them to use chemicals more intelligently.

14:13.467 --> 14:41.297
And so they developed this program with national funds that, and a lot of this was based on Dr. Atkinson's research that if you could, you know, you could train farmers to really understand their insect problems and what they finally did was hire in selected areas what we call county entomologists who would in turn train college students in the summertime

14:41.615 --> 14:51.707
to go out into the fields and really make, you know, research type inspections on the level of insects or disease or whatever it was.

14:52.247 --> 14:58.334
And then, you know, if you had applied insecticides, you used, you know, the safest material possible.

14:58.875 --> 15:06.103
The big emphasis then was to use, began using or getting farmers to use the type of chemicals that

15:06.758 --> 15:15.227
were not persistent, you know, that broke down within a day or two after exposure to the elements instead of the very persistent ones like DDT and so forth.

15:16.228 --> 15:24.518
DDT, you know, those new chemicals, you know, was regarded as a revolution in terms of effect.

15:24.958 --> 15:35.770
And, you know, as I state, I will state to you and anybody else, there never has been a death attributed to DDT, but I could say that there are millions and millions of people alive today

15:36.458 --> 15:39.607
that would not be alive because of its use against mosquitoes.

15:39.627 --> 15:42.074
It was extremely effective against mosquitoes.

15:42.094 --> 15:47.950
But as I said, I don't think there's ever been a human death attributed to DDT per se, but we know there are other problems.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.374
I mean, and it's still in the environment.

15:49.394 --> 15:52.122
We stopped using it 30 years ago, and it's still

15:52.540 --> 16:04.224
You know, it gets concentrated through the various poo chains and so forth, and so it can, you know, it causes problems with reproduction in birds and other things.

16:05.446 --> 16:12.220
But that was a very successful program, and Dr. Atkinson had a great deal of interest in that particular program.

16:12.622 --> 16:15.926
Prize area and so forth related, not Nobel Prize, he got, did he?

16:15.986 --> 16:19.650
No, he got the scientific, something, the United States equivalent.

16:20.170 --> 16:23.714
What did he call it, the National Science Foundation?

16:23.754 --> 16:24.195
I believe so.

16:24.215 --> 16:28.119
Yeah, he's got one of the few people, which is an equivalent to the U.S.

16:28.159 --> 16:28.499
Nobel.

16:29.360 --> 16:35.727
And it was his early work, you know, that led to this, and he was very much concerned with that program.

16:36.809 --> 16:39.912
And he worked, of course, very closely with Dr. Miller.

16:40.668 --> 16:43.611
Dr. Miller didn't last too long, I guess, what was it, three years?

16:43.631 --> 16:44.292
1980.

16:44.312 --> 16:51.120
So it was about 77 to 80, about three years, yeah.

16:51.581 --> 16:59.510
And when Dr. Hubert became the chancellor, was there any change in your, in the way you all did things?

16:59.570 --> 17:01.792
No, not particularly.

17:03.675 --> 17:08.380
I was, I guess I had always considered

17:08.950 --> 17:12.894
Dr. Hubert is one of my good friends and so forth.

17:13.615 --> 17:18.680
In fact, when I was at the University of Wisconsin in our graduate program, he called me out of the blue one day.

17:18.760 --> 17:27.369
He was dean of education, and they were thinking about setting up a department for adult education, that general area.

17:27.389 --> 17:30.873
And he offered me the position right off, you know.

17:31.693 --> 17:37.219
And I felt I had a commitment to Dr. Hutchison because I'd gotten the time off, and I didn't know how he regarded this.

17:37.958 --> 17:43.306
And Dr. Hutchison, you know, really had wanted me to come back to that other position, so I didn't accept it.

17:43.867 --> 17:46.491
And that position, I guess, was—went to Don Seaman, if you know him.

17:47.292 --> 17:49.996
And he started the program here, which is quite good.

17:50.076 --> 18:01.132
But, you know, I always had thought of Dr.—the chancellor as, you know, somebody that was a friend.

18:01.173 --> 18:02.194
And I really had no—

18:02.731 --> 18:16.546
big direct relations with him, but Hubert, Dr. Hubert, he was, I guess, might say getting a little along in years at the time, was somewhat detached from a lot of things.

18:16.566 --> 18:20.951
So he, working with him, you were allowed to lead as you saw?

18:20.971 --> 18:22.593
Yeah, pretty much so.

18:22.833 --> 18:27.979
The, when it came to

18:31.283 --> 18:46.373
It came to a situation, I guess, in the late 81, early 82s, that I think the group that wanted, you know, department heads to have stronger position

18:46.353 --> 18:49.117
decided it's time for me to go.

18:49.137 --> 18:51.881
You know, they weren't getting, making the progress that they wanted to.

18:52.883 --> 19:06.863
And I thought I was, I thought, to this day, I mean, I could show you books and books of testimony of letters I got from the field that, you know, felt that this had been an unjust action.

19:06.904 --> 19:07.905
But anyway, I was,

19:09.623 --> 19:18.557
called in by Dr. Hubert, I guess, with Dr. Atkinson earlier the year or something and essentially told him, I had it, you know, they were gonna make a change.

19:20.039 --> 19:21.181
And that was that.

19:23.685 --> 19:26.830
There was another event, I don't know if that had a bearing on the case.

19:26.950 --> 19:30.315
As I said, I had thought Dr. Hubert was more supportive.

19:30.548 --> 19:34.856
But I had fought him on one thing, and that may have not helped.

19:34.876 --> 19:39.666
I guess sometimes standing on principles, at least as I saw it, everybody defines their own principles.

19:40.888 --> 19:51.308
We had a situation where one of his top assistants, and I don't need to name names, had worked for the Extension Service briefly in an early part of his career.

19:51.710 --> 19:58.821
And as you know, up to a certain point, the extension service people enjoyed federal appointments, and you were aware of that, and get federal retirement.

19:58.841 --> 20:00.263
I'm drawing federal retirement today.

20:01.265 --> 20:11.801
And of course, that sounds very good, drawing both teachers and federal retirement, but as a new worker, it was very painful because that took 7% out of your salary.

20:12.302 --> 20:19.253
Teachers' retirement took 6%, later on 6.5%, plus the various insurance things, and it was very difficult to

20:19.722 --> 20:23.768
to recruit new people because they were really shocked when they got their first check.

20:23.828 --> 20:33.642
Anyway, this individual, you had to have a certain requisite number of years, 10, I think, 20, depending on.

20:34.503 --> 20:44.177
Anyway, this particular individual decided that he would want to fill out his years of extension appointment, and I was told

20:44.832 --> 20:56.547
by Dr. Hubert one day that he called me indirectly and he said, to put, to make him my assistant to, my assistant, and put him on, he had to be on 50% or more on extension assignment.

20:58.169 --> 21:03.476
And I just, you know, I talked to Dr., to Mr. Freeman, you remember him?

21:03.496 --> 21:04.277
He agreed with me.

21:04.317 --> 21:04.798
Clyde Freeman.

21:04.818 --> 21:05.118
Clyde Freeman.

21:05.819 --> 21:07.601
But he said, I don't know that you can do anything.

21:07.621 --> 21:13.489
But anyway, it got to be a real issue within the organization because we had been very, very strict on,

21:13.874 --> 21:20.706
not abusing that privilege, and if anybody got a 50 percent or more assignment, that they did 50 percent or more extension.

21:20.726 --> 21:32.127
Well, the chancellor's attitude and this individual is that, you know, they worked for extension servers generally in the legislature and, but anyway, I, you know, he did have the title of assistant to the extension director.

21:33.028 --> 21:36.895
I tried to get him to do things.

21:37.398 --> 21:44.232
that you often ask, call on assistance to handle correspondence of a certain nature or maybe prepare a speech or something.

21:45.093 --> 21:49.061
And this individual constantly just bucked it to other people on my staff.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.585
Never, never did a whole lot.

21:50.705 --> 21:54.833
I don't think did 1%, per se, for extension.

21:55.572 --> 21:59.560
I, you know, kept trying to get this changed and Dr. Hubert wouldn't change it.

21:59.580 --> 22:02.366
And I guess that didn't help my own personal situation.

22:02.386 --> 22:12.045
But anyway, I was given my walking papers and they said they immediately named Dr. Carpenter, head of animal science, as my successor.

22:12.025 --> 22:13.166
All right, we need to.

22:13.527 --> 22:14.007
Yeah, that's all.

22:14.027 --> 22:15.509
I've got about 10 minutes.

22:15.529 --> 22:16.551
Oh, oh, okay.

22:16.631 --> 22:18.112
I need to leave at 10 afterwards.

22:18.133 --> 22:20.135
All right, because we're not going to get quite through then.

22:20.155 --> 22:21.256
Oh, we're going to get through, surely.

22:22.037 --> 22:25.261
No, because we want to look back more.

22:26.202 --> 22:28.305
Well, you know, everybody sees history from their own viewpoint.

22:28.345 --> 22:28.806
Sure, sure.

22:28.826 --> 22:30.167
That's my vision of it.

22:30.948 --> 22:31.008
No.

22:31.028 --> 22:39.499
And I, as I said, it was, I really personally think it was a great shock to the organization, at least the field staff.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.480
I mean, they were.

22:40.460 --> 22:44.496
really, really shocked because as I said, I was, they felt I was their friend.

22:45.118 --> 22:46.885
They felt I had done a lot of good things.

22:47.086 --> 22:51.583
And as I said, particularly certain groups, I think I had a particularly high

22:52.205 --> 22:54.389
respect from the black staff members.

22:54.509 --> 22:59.999
I mean, they appreciated what I had done in terms of getting the salary situation and administration.

23:00.680 --> 23:10.838
The home economics of the predominantly female staff felt that they had an equal share of the organization or an equal or, you know, were recognized.

23:11.172 --> 23:17.298
Probably a little less support from the agricultural groups because they had, you know, some of them didn't like having women supervisors and so forth.

23:18.019 --> 23:32.853
But anyway, then I was, they made some, gave me some fictitious that they would create some center in the Department of Agricultural Education and Training Center, which I knew was just fiction and, you know, I didn't accept it.

23:32.873 --> 23:39.880
But anyway, I was given the opportunity to have an appointment in the Department of Agricultural Education

23:40.535 --> 24:00.490
which I did and really enjoyed because in September of 82 I started with that department and was immediately given responsibility for teaching courses in adult education and they had an undergraduate course in extension for people who were thinking about extension as a career and then later on got much involved in international activities.

24:00.671 --> 24:02.053
And you did that for how many years?

24:03.265 --> 24:14.420
Oh, Haskell, it kind of, my wife always asks me, I can't ever get this straight, but I continued in that position full-time until about 86, 87.

24:15.461 --> 24:27.417
I had more than enough for my federal retirement, and then I went on half-time assignment and worked just nine months, half-time, teaching some of the courses.

24:27.734 --> 24:34.185
Then I think even later I took my state retirement, and then there was even a period, you know, where you could be re-employed, annuitant.

24:34.927 --> 24:36.570
So I kind of stretched my retirement out.

24:36.590 --> 24:45.726
And I think it was in the early 90s that I probably, before I completely retired, but, you know, I continued to,

24:46.178 --> 24:47.760
I have a little office over in the department.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.842
They still call on me to serve on committees.

24:50.103 --> 24:51.725
I fill in on teaching.

24:51.805 --> 24:56.390
I occasionally will take a course, particularly international courses, for years and years.

24:56.410 --> 25:04.900
We took a group of graduate students and professors to another country to look at international agricultural programs and so forth.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.745
And I guess the last one I did was about three or four years ago to Germany.

25:09.566 --> 25:15.713
As you look back on all of the, this long career of service,

25:17.127 --> 25:22.774
What did it mean to you that you were an Aggie?

25:24.116 --> 25:36.432
What did you learn, being a student here once upon a time, what did you learn that was... Well, I think the biggest thing that you could point to is the whole area of leadership.

25:37.253 --> 25:39.215
You know, you have to... Explain that.

25:40.056 --> 25:41.498
I bought into the situation.

25:41.917 --> 25:44.643
In order to be a good leader, you have to be a good follower first.

25:44.843 --> 25:49.033
And we certainly got in the cadet corps and got that type of thing.

25:49.353 --> 25:50.696
We had to be good followers.

25:51.198 --> 25:57.732
I think from that position, you got to understand what good leadership was and what bad leadership was.

25:57.712 --> 26:13.138
And, you know, I felt that drawing on those examples, even though that it was pretty much a military setting, had application in other areas that you had to, you know, provide leadership

26:14.165 --> 26:19.999
in a way that, you know, that you can't provide leadership unless you have good followers and you have to.

26:20.019 --> 26:23.889
The thing is people have to understand why they're doing things and so forth.

26:24.651 --> 26:31.026
And I always felt I tried to get, you know, as much involvement on the part of people who would be affected by decisions

26:31.006 --> 26:35.933
to make their input and so forth, but I felt, you know, ultimately the leader has to make the decision.

26:37.294 --> 26:37.495
All right.

26:37.515 --> 26:44.704
What else other than leadership came from that you learned about while you were an Aggie?

26:45.045 --> 26:46.707
I think that's the main thing I could point to.

26:46.727 --> 26:49.371
I think the whole area of leadership.

26:50.372 --> 26:53.596
What feelings do you carry in your heart today for Texas A&M?

26:54.498 --> 26:56.220
Absolutely supportive.

26:56.200 --> 27:01.348
I wouldn't participate in the Century Club and some of the other programs if I didn't believe that was so.

27:01.448 --> 27:05.675
I'm thoroughly indoctrinated and have no regrets.

27:05.836 --> 27:12.647
I mean, as I mentioned earlier in my interview, my parents really didn't want me to come to Texas A&M.

27:13.087 --> 27:19.778
They weren't so sure they even wanted me to go to college, but certainly if I went, I should go closer to home like San Antonio Junior College or something.

27:20.365 --> 27:25.591
And it was my decision to come here because I thought this was a great place to get an education.

27:26.311 --> 27:31.837
I had the strong Extension commitment because I had seen what Extension had done for my family.

27:32.037 --> 27:37.683
I mean, it made all the difference in the world in our getting through the Depression and that type of thing.

27:37.763 --> 27:44.871
And I guess even more than my cadet experience, the

27:47.197 --> 27:52.506
admiration I had for extension agents, you know, that caused me to say I want to be like that.

27:53.168 --> 27:55.632
I had no idea, you know, of leadership beyond that.

27:55.672 --> 27:58.176
I mean, my objective then was to be a county extension agent.

27:58.237 --> 28:03.466
I think I could have been happy being that in my whole career, and it didn't work out that way.

28:03.706 --> 28:08.074
If you were giving advice to the extension leaders today, what would it be?

28:11.159 --> 28:18.486
The, I think the, it's so easy to get away from what the local people really want.

28:18.607 --> 28:20.929
I mean, I think you have to have a real close ear.

28:20.949 --> 28:27.456
I mean, even when I go into, I'm often asked to evaluate U.S.

28:27.516 --> 28:29.558
Agency for International Development projects.

28:30.359 --> 28:36.745
And if you go visit into, as an administrator or evaluator, go into, into an area,

28:37.636 --> 28:43.288
The local people that are being evaluated or being looked at are always going to make sure you see the best and don't see the worst.

28:43.368 --> 28:46.034
I mean, we all do that, and I've been there on that side too.

28:46.715 --> 28:51.846
But I always make it a point, and I did when I was director, and I do it when I evaluate programs.

28:51.866 --> 28:52.928
I said, wait, stop here.

28:53.549 --> 28:58.396
at a farm that somebody they haven't identified and talk to a local person.

28:58.796 --> 29:00.499
You know, do you know about the Extension Service?

29:00.719 --> 29:12.075
You know, what do you like about, that's what I do when I do an evaluated farm because they tell me how wonderful their projects are and you, you know, you go five miles from where they're located and you find people that have never heard of them, you know, that kind of thing.

29:12.776 --> 29:20.427
So I think it's important to keep your feet on the ground to understand what the sentiment out there is and I don't think you can get that indirectly.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.328
I think you have to have

29:21.646 --> 29:23.129
You have to be out there some of the time.

29:23.269 --> 29:37.515
I mean, you can't depend, just like a military commander, you know, he'll always be given the favorable and never given the unfavorable news, and if you don't go out there and look yourself, you begin to believe what they give you, and that can be disastrous.

29:37.535 --> 29:42.204
Are there any areas that you think that Extension ought to give more attention today?

29:43.266 --> 29:45.730
Any topical areas, not geographic?

29:46.132 --> 29:47.254
Topical areas?

29:47.975 --> 29:51.600
Any concerns that they ought to spend more time on?

29:51.760 --> 30:03.156
I think this, well, they're beginning to, but I think they're little, they didn't, we didn't move out as fast as we should have in this whole area of using technology in terms of computers and so forth.

30:03.196 --> 30:04.718
They're wonderful for agriculture.

30:04.739 --> 30:07.903
I mean, you know, you can test all kinds of

30:08.508 --> 30:14.056
ideas you have on how economists know that it's the mix of enterprises.

30:14.076 --> 30:17.421
I mean, this much cotton and this much beef or, you know, when you have several things going.

30:17.942 --> 30:20.126
And there's an optimum somewhere there of a mix.

30:20.146 --> 30:24.011
And you can do that with computers that, you know, take you years to try to compute other.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.996
And then it's just a matter of transferring information.

30:27.657 --> 30:30.381
As I think pointed out in a meeting the other day with

30:30.547 --> 30:35.375
Chancellor Graves, it may have been extension moved too, I mean, the university and extension moved too early.

30:35.896 --> 30:37.860
As a result, some of our stuff is antiquated.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.526
Some of the schools have waited later got better stuff.

30:42.348 --> 30:48.859
And we have a problem now, particularly in our county extension offices, in terms of computer technology.

30:49.312 --> 30:52.500
they have to fit in with the local situation and everyone's different.

30:52.540 --> 31:04.671
I mean, you know, your county systems and it creates a big problem, but I think this is a development that Extension can, needs to do a lot more with because, I mean,

31:05.005 --> 31:10.314
I guess ultimately it'll replace publications, the computer will, because of having local outlets.

31:10.995 --> 31:19.189
It'll, you know, just having a farm meeting on Wednesday night or Thursday night or something like that is probably passe now.

31:19.810 --> 31:28.144
But I think there's still, and there's still a lot of farm people out there that, you know, things have gotten bigger and so forth, but...
