WEBVTT

00:03.119 --> 00:11.937
went on to Vietnam after a tour as a drill 
instructor at Quantico, Virginia, and suffered a

00:03.119 --> 00:11.937
bullet wound in the back of his head. These things 
run deep, but the other guy got his girlfriend

00:12.979 --> 00:23.862
pregnant and he had to leave the Corps too, so that 
was two bad apples that left within a year or so of

00:12.979 --> 00:23.862
our arrival. Now, if you got caught, and sometimes 
you wanted to get caught at pranks, this is no

00:24.500 --> 00:30.147
different. Stealing your CO's footlocker or the 
fetal pig in the mess hall or anything else, it's

00:30.167 --> 00:37.895
okay because then we're all in it together. Oh, and 
also then you get credit for the originality of the

00:38.556 --> 00:43.522
prank. Is that part of it? Sure, and we were, you 
know, we stole our, not only our CO, or his

00:44.443 --> 00:53.173
footlocker, but we stole him too, and hid him out in 
the bushes and of course he beat us back in no time.

00:57.784 --> 01:05.090
That was back when the university was trying to cut 
down on stealing foot lockers before the Texas

00:57.784 --> 01:05.090
game. Where did you hide the foot locker when you 
stole it? I don't remember. I wasn't in on hiding

01:12.256 --> 01:13.357
it. A couple of freshmen took it and they had a 
brother-in-law that lived in North Bryan, near as

01:13.517 --> 01:22.705
I remember, and it was in his garage. They got it 
over there. We only had four freshmen with

01:24.460 --> 01:29.033
vehicles, so it was, they were all our best 
friends. It was hard to transport stuff around

01:30.036 --> 01:31.882
back then. All right, and did you take it, did 
somebody take it out on the Kyle Field? It made it

01:36.218 --> 01:38.041
out to Kyle Field. What happened to the guys that 
actually carried it out there? Did they get any

01:41.706 --> 01:44.209
punishment different from anybody else? No, they 
escaped and they did it right at the right time when

01:44.269 --> 01:54.864
the TU band was coming off the field and they 
escaped and didn't get caught because it happened

01:44.269 --> 01:54.864
in Austin and nobody knew what to do with them. So 
they jumped the fence and were gone.

02:00.316 --> 02:01.477
trying to think of what else. We also stole our CO's 
sink, too. We figured, we had a couple guys in there

02:04.521 --> 02:08.025
that said, heck, let's don't stop with the 
footlocker. They took him, let's do whatever we

02:08.065 --> 02:10.628
can to screw him up. How did, was it taken off the 
wall? Taken off the wall, yeah. We had one guy that

02:14.913 --> 02:17.075
had pipe wrenches and everything. We had a group, a 
subunit within our freshman class called the

02:17.095 --> 02:24.824
Aardvarks, and they would scrounge for stuff that 
we needed. If our upperclassmen needed

02:25.605 --> 02:27.707
showerheads, uh... the aardvarks would go steal 
shower heads and i know uh...

02:28.514 --> 02:57.559
rick perry and john sharp were both aardvarks in 
fact for a little while i think perry's nickname

02:28.514 --> 02:57.559
was the blue goose but uh... a guy named mike riesby 
that was in and out of our outfit about three or four

02:28.514 --> 02:57.559
times made it around final review with us i don't 
think he ever graduated but uh... he lives in baton

02:28.514 --> 02:57.559
rouge now constant discipline problem but uh... 
just one of those guys that is just part of the part

02:28.514 --> 02:57.559
of the outfit he uh... He was in the aardvarks. The 
best place to steal showerheads was Corps Staff,

02:59.413 --> 03:10.249
because they didn't have anybody to defend them, 
and they didn't have any freshmen to look after

02:59.413 --> 03:10.249
things, and they could get things fixed, so we 
pretty well, the upperclassmen wanted some

02:59.413 --> 03:10.249
requisition. They never asked us where it came 
from, but steam tunnels were another choice

03:10.269 --> 03:17.681
method of transport. When did you learn about 
steam tunnels? How soon in the year? Some, one of

03:22.929 --> 03:25.673
our, and I don't remember, one of our fish buddies 
came in one Sunday night grinning and he'd heard

03:27.239 --> 03:34.279
about it from someone and had gone exploring and 
these are the tunnels underneath all of the

03:34.597 --> 03:38.463
buildings on the campus. And so got some, you know, 
a couple of us got some flashlights and we were

03:39.684 --> 03:59.794
scared and you go exploring around and we'd end up 
in different parts of the campus and sometime one

03:39.684 --> 03:59.794
night we heard voices and saw a light and we thought 
the campus cops were after us and then we got lost

03:39.684 --> 03:59.794
and then flashlight went out and that kind of 
cooled us on the steam tunneling for a while but

04:00.128 --> 04:05.036
Steam tunnels were something that sort of passed 
on and people found out about but nobody

04:00.128 --> 04:05.036
advertises. Did you ever hear of any injury, any 
unfortunate accident in a steam tunnel? I've not.

04:12.269 --> 04:13.511
I've never heard of a thing. There's writing. We 
found writing on some of the walls from many years

04:18.067 --> 04:19.449
before us. A lot of history down underneath the 
ground at A&M. I don't even know if you can still get

04:22.714 --> 04:23.935
down in them. I have no idea. Oh, there's all kinds 
of security now. Oh, I bet. They've killed that

04:28.462 --> 04:29.744
fun. How long was it before you and your buddies 
began to escape to go have a good time or something

04:31.306 --> 04:39.878
somewhere off campus? Well, there were four Four 
outfit buddies that had, four out of 56 had

04:42.215 --> 04:53.767
vehicles, and of course, numbers started to 
dwindle, but during the fall, you don't have, back

04:42.215 --> 04:53.767
then, didn't have much time to do anything. We had, 
even though we're an Air Force outfit, we

04:53.787 --> 05:00.814
sometimes had Saturday morning drill and things 
like that, edge football games to go to. There

05:00.854 --> 05:06.639
wasn't a lot of breaking out and escaping. Those 
that could, that had steady girlfriends and just

05:06.679 --> 05:11.344
had to be away, would find ways to get back to 
houston or to get to waco but you start you have your

05:11.324 --> 05:27.983
core trips and then one or two other weekends most 
of your expanding doesn't really start happen

05:11.324 --> 05:27.983
until your the spring of your freshman year and 
you've got a little bit more time and you realize

05:27.963 --> 05:31.530
you're not going to die, and then you can get out and 
go do. All right. You had made good grades. You were

05:34.095 --> 05:35.217
Midland Bulldog. Lee Rebel, actually, but that's 
fine. Oh, that new high school. Yeah, the new high

05:39.305 --> 05:40.107
school. All right, and how did the grades turn out, 
say, mid-semester? Mid-semester we're good. I

05:48.325 --> 05:49.767
was fine all the way through. I had a focus on going 
to vet school and Carl Alexander, the boy from

05:49.807 --> 06:08.415
Louisiana, and myself had both posted, I think I 
had a 3.55 and he was 3.2 or 3.3, 3.3 I guess because

05:49.807 --> 06:08.415
we both were distinguished students. That was a 
big deal in our outfit because they hadn't had a

06:08.783 --> 06:12.448
distinguished student in two years. I remember 
they had a corps ceremony and Hector Gutierrez was

06:14.992 --> 06:19.839
the corps commander at that time. He came by and 
pinned a little medals on us or whatever we did, but

06:19.859 --> 06:26.108
we thought it was a big deal and we were encouraged. 
Was that at the first semester? That was at the end

06:27.790 --> 06:34.560
of the first semester, so I guess that probably 
would have been early spring of the second

06:27.790 --> 06:34.560
semester, but midterm grades were fine. I was I 
don't recall, but I knew I was okay. I wasn't

06:38.657 --> 06:39.238
worried. You were taking probably 17, 18 hours? I 
think I was taking 17.

06:45.574 --> 06:50.486
Describe a typical class day routine for you that 
freshman year. What time did you get up and what did

06:50.506 --> 06:52.290
you do? get up whenever I never got up before the 
whistle jock and get up with the first whistle

06:52.844 --> 07:21.062
which I was probably quarter six six o'clock in the 
morning and blow whistles you shower shave get

06:52.844 --> 07:21.062
dressed fall out on the wall sophomores come 
inspect your uniforms ask you questions your

06:52.844 --> 07:21.062
detention on the wall for 15 to 20 minutes before 
you fall out for chow go to formation You march to

07:21.650 --> 07:29.368
chow, you go in, you have your breakfast, get out, 
you have time to get back to your hole. You have a

07:31.153 --> 07:32.516
mail detail going out. Some freshmen's assigned 
mail detail for the day. Somebody had laundry

07:34.842 --> 07:37.127
detail to pick up laundry bags. and get your room 
ready for inspection, and then to head for class.

07:43.881 --> 07:52.872
Classes would start, I always had an eight o'clock 
class, so I was on my way to class by 7.45, at the

07:43.881 --> 07:52.872
latest, 7.40, depending on where the building 
was. That first fall had algebra, chemistry.

08:02.344 --> 08:02.664
English. English and history. in a biology 
course, I guess. Probably those five labs. I never

08:10.248 --> 08:11.450
had any morning labs. They seemed like they were 
always in the afternoon. But going to class,

08:14.295 --> 08:20.666
seemed to have enough time to get from one class to 
another. Didn't need a bicycle or anything. Most

08:22.169 --> 08:25.555
of the classes, they were all in the central part of 
the campus, different. I remember the, let's see,

08:26.176 --> 08:28.901
where was the history class? Was it in the academic 
building? Or was it? Academic and Nagel. I believe

08:33.105 --> 08:34.166
it was in Nagel Hall. We were in Nagel. Academic, I 
had an English class there. And about what, do you

08:39.674 --> 08:44.080
remember the size of the classes? Those classes 
were, for the most, the chemistry class was large.

08:48.307 --> 08:52.913
There was probably 350 students in the chemistry, 
300, 350 students in the chemistry class. The

08:53.955 --> 08:59.663
algebra, English, and history classes were 
probably Less than 25 students, 20 to 25 at the

09:01.448 --> 09:04.671
most. And those were honors classes. There was an 
honors colloquium, I think, probably on a monthly

09:07.634 --> 09:10.657
basis. It was in the old physics building. And this 
is where the... Where did, if you had an hour off in

09:12.719 --> 09:20.166
the morning, where did you take a break, or what did 
you do with a spare hour? If you had time off, there

09:20.767 --> 09:26.733
were times, depending, you might go back to your 
home, go back to your rooms. It was quiet. There

09:29.675 --> 09:31.337
were times I'd go to the library. There were times 
I'd go to the MSC, to Memorial Student Center. I

09:35.373 --> 09:38.757
didn't, there wasn't really any other place to go 
that was fun to go. When you went to the MSC, did you

09:39.017 --> 09:41.279
have a cup of coffee or a Coke? Yeah, a lot of times 
you'd meet somebody, sit down, have a Coke or

09:41.439 --> 09:44.783
visit. Yeah, there's almost always somebody. And 
as a freshman there, we had one fish buddy that

09:47.065 --> 09:54.232
posted one grade point his first semester, Rudy 
Kretschmeyer. I don't remember where he was, but

09:54.252 --> 09:57.595
he came to college with a custom pool cue. Rudy made 
money at the MSC. What he lost on tuition and fees

10:00.479 --> 10:05.547
and flunking out of A&M, he more than made up for 
hustling pool games. And there was more than once I

10:06.429 --> 10:08.632
went over and watched that kid shoot pool. I didn't 
know anything about it, but he was a master. It

10:10.415 --> 10:12.017
would be interesting to know where he is now. Oh, 
he's bound to have done well. He was a hustler. But

10:14.662 --> 10:17.346
the Corps wasn't for him, nor were the academics. 
Did you all march into Chow at lunch, or did you go on

10:18.568 --> 10:21.793
your own?

10:26.684 --> 10:31.170
I believe lunchtime we went on our own. I don't 
believe we formed up. You still, you blocked in at

10:34.674 --> 10:42.745
chow and you were pretty well at the mercy of 
whoever you sat with. I'm pretty sure that's how it

10:42.785 --> 10:43.766
went. I don't recall us having a noontime 
formation. I think it was just morning and

10:46.149 --> 10:48.292
evenings we had our formations. Then in the 
afternoons, if you didn't have a lab, if you had an

10:49.193 --> 10:54.480
unscheduled afternoon, Typically, I was back in 
my hole, studying, getting things ready, if I'd

10:55.034 --> 11:00.985
had nothing else pressing. If I had a project, if I 
needed time to go do something, I would go do it. But

11:06.695 --> 11:09.400
there was no need for me to go anywhere else. I had 
plenty of core activities. There's always stuff

11:13.208 --> 11:15.813
to get ready. There's always room stuff to fix up, 
always uniform, always studies to get ready. If

11:20.943 --> 11:24.630
you have time and you need it, you can go take a nap if 
you can get away with it. In your outfit, did

11:24.831 --> 11:30.762
upperclassmen bother if you were studying in the 
afternoon in your home? Not much. Some of them

11:31.834 --> 11:34.420
might come by and visit, but for the most part, 
they'd leave you alone. And it was rare that you

11:34.941 --> 11:39.390
would ever have any outfit duties unless they had 
something needed to be done. They wouldn't mess

11:39.570 --> 11:40.452
with you. Normally, if you had things to do, that 
started around 5 o'clock in the evening, usually

11:41.013 --> 11:45.843
about an hour before chow. What about 
intramurals? Intramurals, that time period,

11:47.547 --> 11:51.535
that 4, 30, 5 o'clock, we would have, that's when we 
had outfit football, things like that. And do that

11:56.724 --> 12:02.895
till right before chow, get back, and then shower 
and change for chow. And then if there were any

12:03.096 --> 12:09.608
pranks or any time at mealtime, it was at the 
evening meal. Evening meals are where most of this

12:10.162 --> 12:12.546
stuff happened. It seems like breakfast was 
pretty straightforward, but the evening meals

12:12.586 --> 12:18.034
you never knew. And all of my fondest memories, 
more of them center around the mess hall than

12:18.214 --> 12:25.425
anything else, and some not so fond. But the 
evening meal, the whole outfit was together. It

12:29.191 --> 12:35.781
was before quizzes, but everybody, and I don't 
know what it's like now, but I have a feeling a lot of

12:29.191 --> 12:35.781
kids drift in and out, and there's a lot of 
different schedules. Everybody came back home

12:36.318 --> 12:38.060
for the evening. The family came home for the 
evening meal and nobody slept in and missed the

12:38.080 --> 12:43.167
evening meal. Everybody showed up. That was the 
one time everybody was together. One of my not so

12:47.272 --> 12:53.761
fond memories when I was a senior, I was commanding 
officer of our outfit and we'd had problems. We

12:53.881 --> 12:57.987
always lived near the band and so we always had 
friction, always problems. I had three of my

12:58.447 --> 13:03.574
seniors that had basically no jobs in the outfit 
managed Eastgate lounge a beer joint at Eastgate

13:03.858 --> 13:30.979
that was nothing but a template for disaster and 
from where they parked their cars it was a shortcut

13:03.858 --> 13:30.979
to walk right across the BQ drill field which would 
invoke the ire of the BQ's they would come out

13:03.858 --> 13:30.979
sometimes there were fights there were problems I 
found certain doors in the trigon to become very

13:03.858 --> 13:30.979
familiar because I was in vet school at the time and 
trying to run the outfit I'd get back from vet

13:31.280 --> 13:35.687
school and have to go over the trigon and explain 
what happened the night before. Anyway, one day

13:36.729 --> 13:40.095
evening, I was late for evening chow. Executive 
officer took the troops to chow. I got in just in

13:43.040 --> 13:45.424
time. They're just starting to serve. Sat down 
just in time to see a stud bucket, one of the iced tea

13:46.826 --> 13:56.022
pitchers, full, go sailing out of the middle of my 
outfit into the band. And that was, I believe, a

13:57.487 --> 14:06.757
$2,300 food fight later that at least the good 
thing about your other outfits in the Corps, they

13:57.487 --> 14:06.757
would bond together with us. And it was everybody 
against the band, and that's because they had more

14:07.498 --> 14:11.523
people.

14:14.766 --> 14:19.832
Let's

14:14.766 --> 14:19.832
see, we mentioned nicknames. I had a question 
about nicknames, but we've already mentioned

14:19.852 --> 14:21.974
that. Oh, did the faculty have nicknames? so I 
think that had vanished by your day there was one

14:26.512 --> 14:41.061
guy that some of the upperclassmen had I believe he 
taught statistics or something class I was never

14:26.512 --> 14:41.061
involved in last name was linger and they called 
him linger the finger I remember that I don't I

14:42.475 --> 14:48.486
don't recall any now that's been in undergraduate 
days too far back, so I don't recall any other

14:42.475 --> 14:48.486
nicknames. In the early days in the history 
department, there was one guy, extremely,

14:48.626 --> 15:02.712
extremely conservative in his politics, and he 
was called Screamin' Al, and he would cuss

14:48.626 --> 15:02.712
Roosevelt and the other communists in the 
Democratic Party. And there were these

15:02.692 --> 15:05.218
characters. And again, it was like the core 
nicknames. These were kind of identifiers that,

15:09.427 --> 15:14.218
you know, he may be strange, but he's kind of okay. 
Well, we had some in vet school, though. We had

15:16.042 --> 15:18.507
Whispering Willie Banks, who taught radiology 
and showed us an hour and a half of x-rays in a

15:18.993 --> 15:41.068
darkened amphitheater after lunch and talked in a 
quiet monotone and it was death and fell asleep in

15:18.993 --> 15:41.068
his class he'd fail you it was horrible so we would 
learn to answer for other students that were

15:18.993 --> 15:41.068
asleep the other was mad dog davis and some of those 
but those were vet school names

15:43.276 --> 15:51.127
the first tests and the first grades, when did you 
begin to feel like, okay, I think I can do it? I know

15:51.948 --> 16:03.124
when I got my first freshman chemistry quiz back, 
and I made a 94, and they posted the grades,

15:51.948 --> 16:03.124
computerized, it was early computer stuff, but 
they posted them an old printout sheet just taped

16:03.678 --> 16:10.653
to the stone next to the wall, on the wall going into 
the doors. And you walked up the steps, it was like

16:11.735 --> 16:17.026
going to Mecca, and everybody was crowding around 
looking at their grades. And I saw a 94 and I

16:18.048 --> 16:21.455
thought, okay, I can do this. And I remember 
getting an A that same day on an algebra quiz that

16:24.957 --> 16:28.587
came back. And so I knew that I wasn't going to flunk 
out the first week or two at A&M. So I wasn't home

16:33.620 --> 16:37.170
free, but I knew I could do the work. Did any of your 
buddies tease you or pat you on the back that word

16:41.933 --> 16:43.375
circulating? Well, a couple of us had done well, 
and we had probably five or six in the outfit that

16:43.395 --> 16:57.275
had done real well that first three or four weeks, 
and a couple of the upperclassmen called us

16:43.395 --> 16:57.275
goddamn grade point queers, and that old army was 
shot to hell. This outfit will never be the same.

16:59.298 --> 17:02.142
We've never had anybody, you know, do well in this 
outfit. Kind of like an animal house, but... No, I

17:05.693 --> 17:11.039
mean, for the most part, they, you know, the guys 
that didn't, you try to encourage them and the

17:05.693 --> 17:11.039
other guys, great. There wasn't anybody that, we 
had some bright students, had a couple guys who

17:11.559 --> 17:17.065
were very bright that never, never did much. They 
never amounted to much because they found other

17:17.105 --> 17:21.210
interests or things that took away from. Who did 
you turn to for academic advice in your

17:21.750 --> 17:26.295
undergraduate years before you went to vet 
school? We had an outfit advisor, but they, I never

17:28.397 --> 17:33.022
had any, any dealings. Pretty well, you just did 
things on your own. You could,

17:38.127 --> 18:04.827
remember talking with a couple of upperclassmen 
that were in a different outfit that might be in the

17:38.127 --> 18:04.827
same same class that were okay that I could talk to 
and the problem is our sophomore class was so weak

17:38.127 --> 18:04.827
in our outfit they'd lost so many people none of 
them were in pre-vet and none of they were in AG

17:38.127 --> 18:04.827
courses and other things so there wasn't anybody 
in the outfit for me to talk to and that's one of the

17:38.127 --> 18:04.827
things that did as I stayed on in the outfit we felt 
like we really needed to change and we got a little

18:06.258 --> 18:34.830
bit more involved with mentoring and tutoring 
with students and it was encouraged from the

18:06.258 --> 18:34.830
trigon and we had oh gee it was a doctor may have been 
land I can't remember from the college of

18:06.258 --> 18:34.830
agriculture that got to coming over when I was a 
junior I was in vet school at the time but he would

18:06.258 --> 18:34.830
come over and he would visit and counsel with a 
freshman that's probably some of the first but I

18:06.258 --> 18:34.830
was an academic scholastic sergeant and it I think 
it helped. Our attrition was not as bad. Do you

18:40.205 --> 18:45.771
remember some of the first traditional events 
your freshman year? Oh, sure. Take your pick.

18:49.694 --> 19:01.206
First Yale practice after you're at chow and 
somebody yells, tonight, and everybody jumps off

18:49.694 --> 19:01.206
and runs to Kyle Field to practice and do Yale 
practice, and then you uh didn't realize the

19:01.692 --> 19:17.946
tradition of trying to steal each other's guidons 
and the fist fights that broke out and defending

19:01.692 --> 19:17.946
your guidon these are i thought wait these were 
supposed to be our core buddies about that time

19:01.692 --> 19:17.946
somebody hit uh mike reasonably in the back of the 
head and then all hell broke loose and uh We took

19:18.280 --> 19:19.201
care of our own.

19:22.304 --> 19:24.627
Court trip, freshman court trip. Do you remember 
where you were? I remember it well. Fort Worth,

19:26.309 --> 19:27.150
Texas. And I drove up there with Carl Alexander. 
And this is, you know, it seems like nothing now,

19:32.736 --> 19:44.929
but for us to leave College Station and drive to 
Fort Worth and find the house where his date and my

19:32.736 --> 19:44.929
girlfriend and some others were staying, you 
know, May not have been a country bumpkin, but

19:45.263 --> 19:49.628
wasn't used to driving in the big city either, so 
that was interesting. We, of course, played TCU.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.455
Had a fight at the TCU game. We weren't involved 
with, but there were some TCU kids that got cuffed

19:55.475 --> 19:59.260
and hauled off. They pulled a banner in front of the 
Aggie student section that said rotten to the core

19:59.840 --> 20:07.349
and had an apple core with a worm coming out of it. 
Just can't let that stuff happen. When y'all

20:10.998 --> 20:18.929
marched down the street that morning in Fort 
Worth, how did the spectators respond to the

20:10.998 --> 20:18.929
Aggies? Well, you gotta remember, it was the fall 
of 68. This is the height of the Vietnam War. A lot of

20:23.676 --> 20:26.460
anti-war sentiment, and yet there wasn't any 
there. It was, you know, God bless America, we love

20:26.821 --> 20:32.790
you guys, and it made you feel real special. I have 
not yet had a single incident in 150 interviews No,

20:38.555 --> 20:44.464
no, it was just, it was fantastic. And what did you 
all do that you can describe, that you can talk

20:44.945 --> 20:49.712
about now on Saturday night? Well, back up, that 
was Dallas. We went to Fort Worth together, and

20:51.335 --> 20:59.668
that's where the girls were, but the actual court 
trip, and I remember it was in Dallas, and that was

20:51.335 --> 20:59.668
where we had our big... party that night on 
Saturday night. So it was SMU, not TCU? It was SMU,

21:03.292 --> 21:04.594
that's right. TCU fight was when we were 
sophomores, but the girls were over in Fort Worth.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.584
Back to your question, it was... What did you all do 
that Saturday night? That Saturday night we had a

21:12.744 --> 21:14.206
corps party. They had a part of the convention 
center rented downtown in Dallas, had a live band,

21:14.927 --> 21:23.698
and

21:25.282 --> 21:26.486
Of course, we were clueless. We didn't have any 
idea, but it was a giant drunk. And that's the way it

21:29.394 --> 21:32.142
was back then. We got there a little late, and one of 
the girls had to go to the restroom, and she came out

21:33.847 --> 21:38.722
and said, there's two girls thrown up in there. And 
I said, really? And about that time somebody came

21:39.929 --> 21:49.303
out and he'd slipped in the vomit in the men's 
restroom, but it was just a big, loud, wild dance

21:39.929 --> 21:49.303
with lots of drinking. What were people drinking? 
Was it beer or whiskey or what? Both. Both? Both.

21:53.590 --> 22:01.883
And it's amazing because you've got a tremendous 
number of people who are underage, but it seemed to

21:53.590 --> 22:01.883
happen and it seemed to be okay and nobody got in any 
trouble. So you came back home then on Sunday? Came

22:04.727 --> 22:06.730
on Sunday, and that always... There's a certain 
element of depression when we would, as freshmen,

22:06.710 --> 22:15.128
the closer you got to college station, the worst 
day in the world was coming back after Christmas

22:06.710 --> 22:15.128
holidays. And we all got in, we all huddled in one 
freshman's room and one fished whole and all of a

22:15.830 --> 22:26.372
sudden we realized that there was at least seven or 
eight guys that weren't coming back. At least,

22:26.352 --> 22:30.877
maybe more, but... Alright, now the semester 
ended before Christmas then? No, the semester

22:30.937 --> 22:38.224
ended after Christmas, so we had, we still, we came 
back after Christmas, you still had finals to get

22:30.937 --> 22:38.224
ready for, so it wasn't, wasn't a good time. It 
wasn't much fun, and on a court trip going back,

22:38.584 --> 22:44.210
everybody would, would straggle in. We had some 
guys that straggled in at two or three in the

22:44.250 --> 22:53.119
morning, you know, way late to report in, but they 
took head count the next, next Monday morning,

22:53.757 --> 22:59.546
check bruises on necks and bruises on noses, and I 
think pretty well everybody made it. Nobody was in

22:59.566 --> 23:02.250
jail, so it was a successful court trip. Your first 
silver taps, do you remember? I do. We gathered in

23:09.400 --> 23:12.745
the hall, and C.O. and his roommate, Roger 
Matchin, George Schreiber was CO, Roger Matchin

23:13.653 --> 23:25.708
was his XO, explained to us through the addition of 
silver taps and being quiet, and tonight this is

23:13.653 --> 23:25.708
what's going to happen at 1015, and this is how you 
will do it. And then the First Sergeant, Billy

23:26.229 --> 23:33.018
Hall, took over, and anyone caught talking, you 
know, is dead, you know, and this is a very solemn

23:26.229 --> 23:33.018
occasion. And so we quietly streamed, soundless, 
from the Duncan area, and it was a very moving

23:33.058 --> 23:40.307
ceremony. I'll never forget it. Do you remember 
any silver taps for someone that you knew well?

23:46.999 --> 23:47.239
Yes. In 19, that same freshman year, I guess it was, 
was it in the fall? It was probably in the early

23:56.978 --> 23:58.080
spring. One of our fish buddies, Tommy Stein, died 
while we were running. And just by God's grace, it

24:02.658 --> 24:10.402
was the Air Force 5BX exercise long run testing 
deal. And we were out for an outfit run and doing all

24:10.463 --> 24:12.870
this stuff. Tommy, who had been on the track team in 
Hondo, Texas, had a valve failure, and he died

24:13.306 --> 24:20.513
right there next to Duncan Dining Hall on the south 
side there. And I remember our first sergeant,

24:20.914 --> 24:25.639
Bill Hall, giving him CPR. So ours was a little bit 
different outfit, and this may have been one of the

24:25.719 --> 24:33.226
reasons we bonded so closely together, but our 
entire outfit went to the funeral in Hondo. And we

24:33.867 --> 24:35.889
had a number of kids. We had two or three from Hondo 
and DeHannis that were in, well, two or three in our

24:35.929 --> 24:40.714
outfit, and then four or five in that area that were 
in the Corps. And pretty moving deal. We all wore

24:46.385 --> 24:51.336
uniforms and we were there at the Catholic Church 
and then the funeral there in Hondo. Stayed up at

24:51.897 --> 24:56.748
Glenn Garrison's family's ranch north of Hondo, 
about 20 miles north. And... That Silver Taps for

24:59.982 --> 25:02.566
Tommy Stein was very moving. And I know his younger 
brother, Wayne, has kids roughly the age of ours,

25:03.447 --> 25:13.021
and we've met playing baseball against Hondo. You 
remember Coach Stein? Yeah, these things go on.

25:16.205 --> 25:16.886
You remember. It's kind of like family. And do you 
ever remember any mischief as a part of going to or

25:18.649 --> 25:24.217
from Silver Taps? No, no. That was sacrosanct. I 
hope you've never had a report of any, but it is for

25:26.948 --> 25:30.654
real. Those people that want to go to Silver Taps go 
because it's like going to church. It's a worship

25:35.381 --> 25:36.182
service. And for wherever you stand, it's still a 
very meaningful, solemn occasion. And, yeah, it

25:41.811 --> 25:43.434
was never tolerated. There was never any 
giggling, cutting up, grab ass, none of that. This

25:47.857 --> 25:51.220
is an editor's note to be entered in at this point. 
In the 1970s, when I was dean of faculties, a group

25:52.141 --> 26:11.158
of students came to me to seek my thoughts about 
whether or not Silver Tap should be held for an A&M

25:52.141 --> 26:11.158
student who died in a car wreck trying to make a 
getaway from a burglary in Brenham. Was a student,

26:11.178 --> 26:15.602
and I told them that I had always understood since I 
got here as a new faculty member in 1959, that

26:17.320 --> 26:24.790
Silver Taps was to be held for everyone who was a 
student here. And I said, then I think you all need

26:26.512 --> 26:30.838
to decide, was this person a student? For better, 
for worse, for richer, for poorer? That's right.

26:36.345 --> 26:40.650
And they did decide to go ahead and hold it. I was 
thinking, who are we to be the judge for better

26:41.191 --> 26:46.618
or... Never called upon to do that. The, let's see, 
bonfire that year, described by being a fish and

26:47.172 --> 26:57.749
helping to get bonfire going. Probably, again, 
one of the greatest times, and I hope they have

26:59.031 --> 27:12.353
something to replace it for Kyle and his buds that 
come on, but ours was a stacking outfit, we would, I

26:59.031 --> 27:12.353
mean a loading outfit, You had cutting outfits, 
you had outfits that would piss ant stuff out of the

27:12.805 --> 27:22.718
woods, and then you'd have outfits that would load 
onto the lowboys, and then they were taken to the

27:12.805 --> 27:22.718
bonfire area. And there's a true science to this, 
and there's a way to do it, and a right way and a wrong

27:23.299 --> 27:27.925
way. And we were schooled and taught exactly how 
to, and to this day, I've learned how to pick up

27:28.766 --> 27:39.240
heavy objects and how to school people and how to do 
it properly to keep from getting hurt. And we'd

27:39.840 --> 27:41.783
lift the logs up and The guys closest to the truck, 
we'd pitch them up, they'd switch sides, and then

27:42.117 --> 27:47.926
we'd slam them down, everybody's hands on top. And 
we loaded all those trucks, and nobody ever got

27:48.828 --> 27:53.535
hurt. We had wrestling matches. When we had time 
off, it was people chewing tobacco, and we all wore

27:56.960 --> 28:03.931
red and white polka-dotted welder's caps. Those 
were our outfit caps. We were kind of an ag outfit,

28:05.233 --> 28:08.158
and we had... There was a lot of, there were foot 
races and tug of wars and wrestling matches and a

28:09.691 --> 28:22.472
couple times we had freshmen against sophomores 
and they got pretty heated pretty quick, but it was

28:09.691 --> 28:22.472
all good fun. We had one group, Spider D boys were a 
cutting outfit and they'd cut down a tree that had a

28:22.532 --> 28:31.406
bunch of honeybees in it and a bunch of wild honey. 
And they left a couple people guarding the honey

28:33.069 --> 28:37.015
and We went around and one of our boys, Fish 
Schwartz, said, hey guys, look at this. And we

28:40.968 --> 28:42.289
stole half of their honey. And just little things 
like that that make it all worthwhile. Where was

28:46.114 --> 28:47.455
the cutting area, do you remember? Don't recall. 
Don't recall. It was about, near as I can remember,

28:48.977 --> 28:53.442
it was probably about 15, 20 miles from the campus. 
It wasn't real close. And the bonfire was it on the

28:54.443 --> 28:58.087
drill field or at Duncan? It was at Duncan. Duncan. 
And the bonfire was another one of these, Oh

29:07.758 --> 29:14.891
tremendous bonding bonding bonding deal between 
that steel and the footlocker that really brought

29:07.758 --> 29:14.891
your your fish class together. The bonfire 
belonged to the freshmen and it was we took a lot of

29:14.931 --> 29:23.786
pride in it I think the bonfire that year was a 
hundred and two foot tall. About how long did y'all

29:23.806 --> 29:27.533
work on it? My recollection I believe we worked on 
it probably three straight days of loading, and

29:31.838 --> 29:41.115
then there were a couple of early weekends 
involved as well, but three straight days.

29:44.240 --> 29:49.290
During that first year, were there any 
celebrities that came to the campus? No. Outside

29:52.355 --> 29:53.357
of

29:57.083 --> 30:00.330
See, General Rutter died when I was, I guess, a 
sophomore. You know, you had your town hall

30:01.633 --> 30:05.742
performers and that sort of thing. I'm sure there 
were, I don't recall any, or anything anything

30:11.107 --> 30:39.207
special we did have i can remember they weren't 
celebrities but we had as typically we had some

30:11.107 --> 30:39.207
kids from west point that were staying with one of 
the outfits and we had the privilege of taking them

30:11.107 --> 30:39.207
to the quad you know as soon as a upperclassman saw 
them and said you know don't mess around don't wait

30:11.107 --> 30:39.207
for the army kid you guys get in there you get them 
and so we took those west point guys to the quad At

30:39.187 --> 30:46.719
the end of that freshman year, well, let's see, 
let's do Muster. Did you go to Muster? Not, not,

30:47.880 --> 30:50.765
where was I? Yes, I did. Went to Muster because we 
sat out on the lawn at the MSC. That's where it was.

30:57.255 --> 30:57.876
Went to Muster. And, you know, things start 
happening pretty fast at the end of your your fish

31:02.305 --> 31:06.190
year, there are positions coming up, there are 
awards, there are different things. Those that

31:07.812 --> 31:11.156
are going to survive realize that they've made it. 
How did you feel at final review that fish year?

31:18.404 --> 31:27.435
I remember a senior in our outfit named Ricky 
Reynolds from Midland that had a big old scar face

31:18.404 --> 31:27.435
from a car wreck, but he
