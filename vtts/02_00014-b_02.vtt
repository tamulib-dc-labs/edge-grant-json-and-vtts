00:00:02.832 --> 00:00:32.721
What were the joys and frustrations, primary joys and frustrations of that task?

00:00:36.076 --> 00:00:39.464
I pretty much left the study abroad run by their own director.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:43.554
Now remember also I had the counseling center.

00:00:43.574 --> 00:00:54.760
Now that was frustrating because the guy who'd been brought here from the University of Oregon as director, when he was brought here, that reported to Ed Cooper as being

00:00:55.212 --> 00:00:58.098
It was separated down and come underneath.

00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:03.388
And he didn't like the fact that as director, he was reporting to a director.

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:13.086
And he's one of these guys that always, I don't know how many times I've said Malthus and Harrington talk about his hidden agendas, whatever they were.

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:17.254
I mean, he was constantly frustrated.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:38.179
And I was constantly dealing, I probably spent as much or more time dealing with the counseling center and his personal views on where he fit it in as anything.

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:46.022
I think a joint part of that job was doing the new faculty orientation.

00:01:46.042 --> 00:01:49.046
I thought that was long overdue for the university.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:55.635
We've always had orientation for students, but new faculty were just thrown out there to do whatever.

00:01:56.456 --> 00:02:00.141
I had one faculty member who had been here and went to Southern Illinois and came back.

00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:04.086
You may know Jim Crock in education.

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:07.170
He said, Ron, I learned more in that week about A&M.

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:11.190
than learning the seven years of whatever it was that I was here before.

00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:22.146
I'm not claiming we did that good of a job, but we tried to do it.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:25.952
The frustrating part, other than dealing with the academic counseling part,

00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:30.403
was at the end of the semester, we sent out our drop letters.

00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:44.368
And what you, as you want to go to the phone calls from parents, and occasionally from other people, mostly from parents or from students, you mean that my son or daughter cannot come back.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:45.591
Why?

00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:49.678
And I would go through this, and more often than not, the parent would not know

00:02:50.148 --> 00:03:03.407
how poorly their child had done at any time, because they had not been taught.

00:03:03.427 --> 00:03:11.739
And then we have a constant stream of people coming.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.381
Ed Guthrie took care of part of it, and I took care of part of it, and explained.

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:17.387
And much like the ground, it blew to a block of .4 is pretty bad.

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:21.220
But she did come back and she was a smart girl.

00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:33.047
But I think the most frustrating part, other than acting as a counselor, was dealing with the end of the semester

00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:50.698
Did you often find that parents were uninformed about their child's grades

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:58.756
Well, there were male grades, but I'm not sure if they understood them.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:11.376
The students say, yes, I made a deal in that course because Professor Smith was so bad and did not treat me right.

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:15.623
But I think some would generally be surprised how poorly their child had done.

00:04:16.514 --> 00:04:26.308
And to understand the context of which, well, if you're down this many grade points, then the chances of you ever graduating are pretty slim.

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.854
And how did you all advise the students then?

00:04:32.156 --> 00:04:33.257
Who did the advising?

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:41.188
I did some of it, but I hadn't got them so sure that I had four advisors.

00:04:41.607 --> 00:04:50.520
Many who were part-time, they were graduate students in the EDC and our EdSite, mostly EdSite.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:58.271
A few were full-time, part-times who were not pursuing any graduate program.

00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:08.124
Now also in there, we did the pre-law advising, the pre-med advising, and almost all of that type of stuff.

00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:09.927
Some of the pre-med, as long as

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.042
What was that guy named Gravitt?

00:05:13.143 --> 00:05:13.985
Howard Gravitt.

00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:17.269
As long as he was around, he would do all of that in a second.

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:19.272
But after that, we did some of it.

00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:21.656
We did some of pre-everything.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.089
Usually, personally, when I talk to a student, my first question was, how do you study?

00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:33.973
And who do you study?

00:05:33.993 --> 00:05:35.816
And how much time do you devote to this?

00:05:36.477 --> 00:05:40.302
And how do you pursue it?

00:05:40.585 --> 00:05:47.053
And this would be the same thing I was talking to in my own class when I was talking to them.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:51.618
And I almost invariably knew this, but I knew that most were not for vulnerability.

00:05:51.638 --> 00:05:57.845
Most were for time management, time organization.

00:05:58.046 --> 00:06:02.411
And I said, now you have a, tell me your schedule.

00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:07.637
I have MWF 8th and MWF 11th, so I said, what do you do between 9 and 11?

00:06:08.398 --> 00:06:10.120
Well, I go to the MS and get a cup of coffee.

00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:17.359
I said, you ever think about sitting down on the bench out there and reading 10 pages of history and doing five math problems or whatever?

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.784
Oh, oh, oh, we study between classes.

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:21.328
I said, it won't hurt.

00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:26.759
I said, have you ever thought about studying material but worse talking about it in class?

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:28.142
Oh, we do that?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.888
I said, when did you look at your notes the first time, the night before the exam?

00:06:33.908 --> 00:06:37.934
So you ever thought about looking at the day you take them and working on them?

00:06:38.215 --> 00:06:40.979
Stuff that you've all said a thousand times.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.864
But mostly it came, well, I don't have time.

00:06:43.884 --> 00:06:48.191
I said, okay, you describe your day to me and you tell me what you do.

00:06:48.211 --> 00:06:50.975
And then as it went on, I said, look, we had this time here.

00:06:51.636 --> 00:06:53.860
Oh, oh, oh.

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:59.184
It just, but in part to answer your question, this is the way I handle it.

00:06:59.204 --> 00:07:11.118
This way I'm trying to have the people who work for me have it, and that you approach and understand the point that these people are generally capable, and the thing you need to do is find some way to motivate them.

00:07:11.258 --> 00:07:16.945
Did you all encounter many students that in hindsight perhaps shouldn't have been admitted

00:07:19.523 --> 00:07:21.588
There were probably some.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:24.916
But most of the students had the capabilities.

00:07:24.937 --> 00:07:29.548
They had the capabilities, but they were not used.

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.335
What was the typical student load in that era?

00:07:35.082 --> 00:07:42.813
You're talking about 15 hours, 15 to 19, depending on what you're making.

00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:43.794
15 would be minimal.

00:07:43.814 --> 00:07:49.402
This 12-hour stuff has come along, and that's part of the government's fault.

00:07:49.422 --> 00:07:52.867
Because if you take 12 hours, then you're eligible for a NEO.

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:58.896
I don't know what these things are.

00:07:58.876 --> 00:08:07.047
if at that time, what were the off-campus

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:13.750
or the extracurricular problems that these students, were they drinking much?

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.453
Were there drugs in that era?

00:08:16.054 --> 00:08:19.820
You're talking about the 60s, where it was a great deal of drugs.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.581
I didn't know about that.

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.685
What about the late 70s and early 80s?

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.830
If it was, I did not see it in my students.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.676
I'm sure it was there.

00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:37.759
There were occasional times when I would see a student who was perhaps having it.

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:47.715
One thing I learned very quickly, if I found a student that I felt was really going to the deep end, I would at that moment call counseling and take them over or get them over.

00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:52.756
pretty quickly.

00:08:52.776 --> 00:08:55.719
For a while we had two counseling centers, which I thought was a mistake.

00:08:57.041 --> 00:09:00.105
Wade Birch is headed, I guess they're surviving the one now.

00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:07.794
There's academic counseling that I had, and student counseling was the one over in the Y.

00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:14.142
Do you remember any truly tragic situations you encountered?

00:09:31.925 --> 00:09:41.967
I was thinking, I had this one young man in the reserve unit, his roommate called me and said he had just taken off going down Weldon Road.

00:09:44.232 --> 00:09:51.688
So I got in the car and found him and brought him back to the office, which was in Naval, only this

00:09:52.394 --> 00:09:57.586
Brother Roddick, he'd had three or four years active duty, come back in and he was in the reserve unit.

00:09:57.606 --> 00:09:59.671
And his bottom line was he was lonely.

00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:01.094
And I thought that was strange.

00:10:01.395 --> 00:10:04.662
I've never understood myself how you can be lonely.

00:10:04.682 --> 00:10:07.248
I mean, I just never had experienced that.

00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:10.977
And it turned out his only real...

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:16.935
whether the class was in the reserve unit.

00:10:16.955 --> 00:10:27.334
So we sort of built on that as his base for belonging to something.

00:10:27.414 --> 00:10:33.285
This doesn't deal with a student, but you remember a department head named Bill Smith in psychology

00:10:34.784 --> 00:10:38.687
And I may have related you to this before.

00:10:38.708 --> 00:10:40.129
I know he committed suicide.

00:10:40.149 --> 00:10:44.413
About two days before that, we were in his office listening.

00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:47.315
And we were talking about a variety of things.

00:10:49.657 --> 00:10:55.242
And he said, darling, you know, I've got a little problem.

00:10:55.262 --> 00:10:56.263
I said, what is it?

00:10:56.283 --> 00:10:58.705
And he said, the effect of cheating on main contacts.

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.128
That's not the word he used.

00:11:01.148 --> 00:11:03.329
Let's remove that word cheating.

00:11:03.349 --> 00:11:03.930
He said,

00:11:04.248 --> 00:11:05.169
Somebody's in contact.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.291
I said, I don't think about it.

00:11:07.371 --> 00:11:20.584
It's always been my understanding that if you made a mistake or whatever, if you contact the IRS and it sets us up, take your fines, take your penalties, or whatever.

00:11:20.604 --> 00:11:21.105
And we went on.

00:11:21.846 --> 00:11:24.708
And then two days later, I'm shutting this up.

00:11:24.729 --> 00:11:32.216
And I wondered for years after that if I missed something in my conversation with you.

00:11:32.236 --> 00:11:34.238
Because two days isn't very long.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:42.330
And he bought that pistol that day, and we talked the day after, within a relatively short period.

00:11:43.352 --> 00:11:46.276
And you drove out where it was, the highway, and you killed him.

00:11:46.296 --> 00:11:48.539
Of course, he didn't live too far from you, however long you did.

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:49.260
Just across the street.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:49.781
Across the street.

00:11:51.764 --> 00:11:56.310
A descendant of the family of Joseph Smith.

00:11:57.421 --> 00:12:14.001
But a Mormon convert, his wife, and he also had a drinking problem, which ate on him, apparently, because that was certainly inconsistent with the Mormon church.

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:18.366
So he had a whole bunch of things nagging at him.

00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:21.610
Well, I mean, she was the director of the Senate.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.831
I believe she was a .

00:12:23.372 --> 00:12:24.493
Yeah, that's right.

00:12:24.613 --> 00:12:25.314
That's right.

00:12:25.334 --> 00:12:31.561
And he was talking about how badly the Swedes who came out there as railroad workers were treated in Utah.

00:12:32.282 --> 00:12:39.751
And then he changed it and made it somewhere to Smith, I think, to get away from the Swedish background.

00:12:40.591 --> 00:12:44.556
With the students, I can't recall any

00:12:45.532 --> 00:12:49.518
And this one girl, I wouldn't call her, it was close to tragic for her.

00:12:51.822 --> 00:12:59.674
In Harrington, we had these partial walls which had the spines, because you could hear everything going around.

00:12:59.694 --> 00:13:13.075
This one girl was in, we were talking about her academic problems, so what it really got, she had an abortion that summer, and it was really, really preying on her mind.

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:26.685
And I didn't feel I was confident to deal with that, and I think I'm going to turn it over to student council.

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:27.146
But I don't, you know.

00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:37.341
You know, our current, our immediate past dean of science here named Ewing,

00:13:38.941 --> 00:13:42.606
You were here when his brother Floyd died in the arms.

00:13:42.626 --> 00:13:50.576
But that's not directly, it was a tragedy for the Ewing family.

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:53.800
Yeah.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.221
Let's see.

00:13:55.803 --> 00:14:08.239
In that student service area, do you remember having any difference in the problems and the realities that you all dealt with

00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:16.588
among the corps members compared to the civilian students, compared to the women, compared to the blacks or the Hispanics?

00:14:30.463 --> 00:14:31.184
I guess not.

00:14:31.244 --> 00:14:36.049
You mean did we see more of either of these?

00:14:36.873 --> 00:15:01.200
And did any outsider attempt inappropriately to affect the way you all went around your business?

00:15:03.943 --> 00:15:06.306
All right, in terms of the

00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:23.211
you began that service when Jarvis Miller was president and Mac Prescott was vice, I think we then still call it vice president, and you reported to Prescott.

00:15:24.012 --> 00:15:25.394
Did they give you?

00:15:25.414 --> 00:15:27.999
I reported through Chuck.

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:29.881
Through Chuck McCandless.

00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:34.048
Were you given any guidelines when you started?

00:15:34.214 --> 00:15:38.263
We just sat down and talked about what we were going to do and what's going to be in it.

00:15:38.283 --> 00:15:48.184
Now, as that, I sat on the AOC, but I also went to APC, though APC was composed of provosts and the deans.

00:15:48.745 --> 00:15:49.687
I sat in there.

00:15:49.847 --> 00:15:52.493
I was not a voting member.

00:15:53.114 --> 00:15:56.979
All right, the AOC, Academic Operations Committee.

00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:00.744
That was all the associate and assistant deans for student affairs in the various colleges.

00:16:00.764 --> 00:16:04.069
Describe the real function of those people.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.250
Of that group?

00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:05.751
Yeah.

00:16:07.013 --> 00:16:09.556
And of those individuals, what they did in their colleges.

00:16:10.758 --> 00:16:14.923
Well, each college had either an assistant or associate dean, one or two.

00:16:14.983 --> 00:16:19.089
I'm not talking about the ones for research.

00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:20.691
This is one for student affairs.

00:16:24.586 --> 00:16:32.200
the life or death or the stay or don't stay of the students, which is we did in academic services for our general studies.

00:16:33.983 --> 00:16:38.572
They were the John Beckhams and the...

00:16:38.592 --> 00:16:44.603
Describe some of those people that you remember, like John Beckham, certainly.

00:16:45.106 --> 00:16:52.254
with John Beckham for I don't know how many years with the Association of Science, dealing with students.

00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:59.103
John had a very deep, resonant voice and he scared the kids to death.

00:16:59.123 --> 00:17:01.045
And I don't think he was, he was just talking normal.

00:17:03.408 --> 00:17:07.713
John ran a, in the College of Science ran a pretty tight ship.

00:17:07.733 --> 00:17:12.058
And he had a guy who was his assistant who is still around us on the boat,

00:17:13.152 --> 00:17:15.679
to read Reno the night, but I can't remember his name.

00:17:17.284 --> 00:17:20.152
But John, you always knew where he stood.

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:26.790
He was, I would say, generally working in the interest of the student, but don't mess with me.

00:17:27.563 --> 00:17:31.669
And if he kicked one out, it was usually a pretty good reason.

00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:36.316
Sam Gillespie was always way out there somewhere.

00:17:36.516 --> 00:17:37.097
In business.

00:17:37.377 --> 00:17:37.898
In business.

00:17:38.979 --> 00:17:44.928
I know Sam must have gotten tired because he's usually voted down nine to one of whatever he brought up.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.111
I say nine.

00:17:47.452 --> 00:17:55.183
However many was there, Sam always thought, I've told you this, I always want to be too hard on the students.

00:17:55.203 --> 00:17:55.343
Mm-hmm.

00:17:55.863 --> 00:18:00.590
And, of course, business got a pretty bad reputation here on that.

00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:14.931
And if someone would bring up something, invariably he'd be voted down because whatever he wanted to do was what most people thought was not what they should have been doing.

00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:16.393
In education?

00:18:19.518 --> 00:18:23.203
For a long time it was Brian Cole, and Brian's a good guy.

00:18:24.128 --> 00:18:27.633
I understand now he's back as department head.

00:18:27.914 --> 00:18:31.719
You know, the reason he gave up being associate dean, he couldn't get promoted.

00:18:32.661 --> 00:18:35.866
He was associate professor in this university.

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:37.428
We're not promoting an administrator.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.634
All right, let's see.

00:18:42.876 --> 00:18:46.522
He spent an awful lot of time outside of that job publishing.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.162
Agriculture.

00:18:48.224 --> 00:18:50.187
Ag was usually...

00:18:53.677 --> 00:18:55.299
He just lives up here on Camelot.

00:18:57.042 --> 00:18:59.184
Dwayne Suter was there.

00:19:00.366 --> 00:19:01.988
Or Dean Potts.

00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:06.835
Potts was pretty much gone when I got involved in it.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:07.776
Usually it was Dwayne.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:16.107
Dwayne of Education, Sam Glessie for business, John Beckham for science.

00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:18.350
Liberal arts.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.397
Diane Stromer and later Candy.

00:19:25.115 --> 00:19:29.300
Did Architecture have one?

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:34.766
She was married and realized she was a lesbian and left and divorced her husband.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:42.735
Architecture sometime was John O'Neill Greer.

00:19:44.898 --> 00:19:47.601
McGillivray for a long time was in that.

00:19:51.045 --> 00:19:54.008
She was composed of Ed Cooper.

00:19:54.882 --> 00:20:08.502
who was chair as Dean of Admissions and myself as director and then the assistant and our associate dean for Aberdeen College.

00:20:08.522 --> 00:20:12.128
Now usually it was the same guy but sometime it may be some other.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.477
In general this, the charge of this was, generally said academic policy.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:26.418
as far as student affairs, how to deal with them, how to decide who to kick out, not specifics.

00:20:27.138 --> 00:20:30.822
Did that group of people care about students?

00:20:32.244 --> 00:20:33.305
Generally very much so.

00:20:33.605 --> 00:20:43.296
I always thought that Sam, I've told him this, that Sam, he really don't like, I can put it in that kind of words, but most did or they would not have been there.

00:20:44.437 --> 00:20:48.261
And some of the same ones assert on the,

00:20:49.912 --> 00:20:50.794
What was the name of that?

00:20:51.675 --> 00:20:56.945
We're the committee that heard appeals from being kicked out.

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:07.043
Then for a while, I was chair of the University Academic Appeals Committee for faculty, and I didn't like that job.

00:21:08.255 --> 00:21:15.044
Fortunately, the three years I was on it, we didn't have a single faculty member separated that we had to deal with.

00:21:15.064 --> 00:21:23.375
And I'm glad I've not had to deal this last two years with, what's his name, problem or problem, whatever that is.

00:21:23.395 --> 00:21:23.676
All right.

00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:27.901
Back on the campus, Dr. Miller was president.

00:21:27.922 --> 00:21:35.432
And were you by chance, you were not at commencement, his last commencement, where he didn't shake hands with a student.

00:21:35.592 --> 00:21:36.473
Okay.

00:21:36.453 --> 00:21:42.422
How did you hear that he had been terminated as president?

00:21:42.442 --> 00:21:42.883
Do you know?

00:21:44.025 --> 00:21:47.190
I was MSC when he was appointed and all of us were aghast.

00:21:47.671 --> 00:21:48.091
Oh, okay.

00:21:49.734 --> 00:21:50.054
Why?

00:21:50.295 --> 00:21:51.597
You were aghast, why?

00:21:52.338 --> 00:21:55.583
I had known Jarvis so short and I just couldn't imagine him.

00:21:56.244 --> 00:21:58.047
See, we were at Abraham Methodist Church together.

00:21:58.488 --> 00:22:01.212
We had kids the same age.

00:22:01.428 --> 00:22:05.473
Not that we saw him that much socially, but we would see him occasionally.

00:22:05.553 --> 00:22:08.057
I always thought he was a like.

00:22:08.317 --> 00:22:09.218
Don't put that down.

00:22:09.238 --> 00:22:16.908
Well, is there anybody that you and other faculty members thought was the likely president at that time?

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.231
Did you all have an opinion about Calhoun?

00:22:19.752 --> 00:22:20.973
I assumed it would be John.

00:22:23.456 --> 00:22:24.978
So did I. I was just shocked.

00:22:24.998 --> 00:22:26.300
So did I.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.085
And I can't remember who came in and told us that.

00:22:30.571 --> 00:22:33.716
Someone who worked in the MSC had just heard it.

00:22:34.938 --> 00:22:41.568
And my guess is 2, 3, 2.33 in the afternoon or whatever.

00:22:41.588 --> 00:22:44.432
Somewhere about in there.

00:22:44.793 --> 00:22:46.255
All right.

00:22:46.415 --> 00:22:50.361
Do you remember anything that changed under his administration, generally?

00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:52.084
Better or worse?

00:22:55.649 --> 00:22:57.372
Not for me personally, except...

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.793
I got this job.

00:22:59.813 --> 00:23:01.376
See, we were in California.

00:23:03.421 --> 00:23:06.488
When did you appoint Mack as provost?

00:23:06.508 --> 00:23:07.891
Almost the first week.

00:23:08.933 --> 00:23:09.394
Why were we?

00:23:09.435 --> 00:23:12.101
Because we were in California and called back home.

00:23:13.744 --> 00:23:18.094
See, Mary was working for Mack, and I guess that's when we learned he was provost.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:29.262
Because Jarvis called me in the first day and said he was considering Maxwell, Prescott, and me.

00:23:29.282 --> 00:23:34.990
I think I agree with you.

00:23:37.213 --> 00:23:38.335
I don't know.

00:23:39.356 --> 00:23:39.957
I don't know.

00:23:41.139 --> 00:23:47.608
When you heard that Dr. Miller had been terminated?

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.526
I just remember hearing that Roy said we were going to fire his ass, but I don't know where it was.

00:23:54.546 --> 00:23:58.933
Because that happened, the decision was made late on a Wednesday 20 years ago this summer.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.487
Let's see, did I just ask you were not present at the commencement when he didn't shake hands?

00:24:08.507 --> 00:24:08.787
Okay.

00:24:10.249 --> 00:24:11.872
I don't know where I was.

00:24:13.514 --> 00:24:17.460
Do you remember what the general reaction was of faculty and staff?

00:24:18.925 --> 00:24:23.091
Generally, they were not sorry to see him go.

00:24:23.111 --> 00:24:25.314
Jarvis, he couldn't cut it.

00:24:25.415 --> 00:24:29.100
He just wasn't.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:36.210
And then Samson came back, and I don't think Ruth has ever gotten over him not getting that job.

00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:43.000
She liked being the acting president.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.523
What's different acting in the interim?

00:24:45.164 --> 00:24:46.165
I don't know.

00:24:46.853 --> 00:24:52.143
Because I read on Mrs. Dickey, she was acting and she was made interim.

00:24:52.163 --> 00:24:52.583
Yes.

00:24:52.603 --> 00:24:56.070
And I do not know, and I don't know a linguistic distinction.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.571
I don't either.

00:24:57.052 --> 00:24:57.532
I don't either.

00:24:58.995 --> 00:25:01.460
Then Vandenberg became president.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.545
Did that have any effect on your task at all?

00:25:05.387 --> 00:25:05.667
No.

00:25:05.848 --> 00:25:09.975
Well, yes, because every time I had him lined up to speak, he didn't show up.

00:25:10.647 --> 00:25:12.431
Here.

00:25:12.451 --> 00:25:13.673
No, honestly.

00:25:13.733 --> 00:25:14.855
New faculty orientation.

00:25:16.038 --> 00:25:18.302
First we had the provost and .

00:25:18.322 --> 00:25:26.378
And every time, after the first time, we needed .

00:25:26.543 --> 00:25:33.731
because here we have 200 new faculty and you're gonna get to meet your president now.

00:25:33.751 --> 00:25:39.098
And did you retire, who was president when you retired?

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:43.803
It was in 86.

00:25:43.823 --> 00:25:46.005
Was Vandiver still president, I guess, okay.

00:25:46.987 --> 00:25:54.255
All right, compare the students in your last years and in your first years.

00:25:55.906 --> 00:26:03.117
You know, I've often thought about that, and people talk about all these monumental changes, and they're better or worse things, whatever.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:16.839
And I'd be terribly reluctant to say that between the late 50s and the mid-80s that there was a marked difference.

00:26:16.859 --> 00:26:19.163
I know I've read where they're supposed to have been.

00:26:19.835 --> 00:26:24.621
but maybe the way I've felt about students or dealt with students.

00:26:27.725 --> 00:26:34.172
I know those who sit up and get on a soapbox and say they're 200 times better and better prepared today than they've ever been.

00:26:35.234 --> 00:26:43.423
I often think preparation is only preparation, but attitude, how you approach it, how you work it, something like that.

00:26:43.443 --> 00:26:44.745
I'm curious when we get through,

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:52.311
I don't know.

00:26:54.955 --> 00:27:04.489
I feel that they're a little better prepared now that their math and their science, that they've read a little more, they've traveled a little more.

00:27:05.752 --> 00:27:21.685
On the other hand, I would still take, I'd like to know where that person is today, but it's probably the CEO of something.

00:27:27.098 --> 00:27:33.329
In terms of your courses that you taught, did you grade any differently?

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.012
Was an A?

00:27:35.973 --> 00:27:37.997
It's always an A's and A's and A's.

00:27:38.017 --> 00:27:41.122
OK. And the B's and B's and the D's.

00:27:41.202 --> 00:27:42.745
You have to shift.

00:27:42.725 --> 00:27:49.958
You know, we'd go from 60s passing to 70s passing or whatever, or 90 or 94.

00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:57.070
But I never consciously felt that I was really any different.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:03.501
Now, Fred claimed that when I had him in the Constitution, I graded him harder than anybody else.

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:06.306
He may have been correct.

00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:21.051
Did you have a similar percentage of F students under the higher admission requirements in the 80s, a smaller number?

00:28:23.444 --> 00:28:28.789
What about their general attitude, liberal, conservative, sophistication, et cetera?

00:28:28.849 --> 00:28:29.649
Any difference there?

00:28:29.709 --> 00:28:32.972
Well, I certainly think they may be somewhat more sophisticated.

00:28:34.354 --> 00:28:40.039
Obviously, I think the whole world, at least our society, is somewhat more.

00:28:40.579 --> 00:28:51.949
If by that you mean you mentioned more widely traveled, better read, I guess what I was thinking about public government

00:28:52.688 --> 00:28:56.640
I think there's a difference between being prepared and being intellectually able.

00:28:59.506 --> 00:29:02.469
I hear people making, geez, well, I came from a small high school.

00:29:02.529 --> 00:29:06.894
Well, I don't care how small a high school you came from.

00:29:06.914 --> 00:29:10.898
If you decide that you want to go there.

00:29:10.918 --> 00:29:16.965
I'm reminded of this graduate student that Prescott had one time when we were in the lab.

00:29:16.985 --> 00:29:21.570
He didn't see his first school in Mexico until he was 12.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.212
He didn't learn to read until he was that.

00:29:24.193 --> 00:29:27.336
And when he was here as a graduate student,

00:29:27.316 --> 00:29:35.993
He was a crackerjack, because he had the innate ability to do it, and he was given the opportunity.

00:29:38.369 --> 00:29:48.411
I guess I've always been a little bit hesitant to compare the 80s to the 50s or 60s as far as intellectual ability.

00:29:48.912 --> 00:29:53.381
Preparation maybe, greater exposure, certainly.

00:29:53.401 --> 00:29:58.352
Compare the history department when you retired to when you arrived.

00:30:00.577 --> 00:30:17.677
When I arrived, probably the next 20 or 25 years after that, I thought it was, I hate to use the word integrated whole, but certainly people who cared about each other, respected each other, and were not trying to cut each other's throat.

00:30:18.398 --> 00:30:24.846
Before I retired, it was in groups and cliques and

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.687
I just, I didn't, and I think it's even much worse now from what I hear.

00:30:32.749 --> 00:30:35.273
What about their attitude about students and teaching?

00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:39.921
Research is first, and students are somewhere down there.

00:30:40.542 --> 00:30:43.847
I'm not sure how far down, but it's down there somewhere.

00:30:44.148 --> 00:31:00.337
See, for many, many years, not just because I was an undergraduate advisor, but after that, I know Chuck used to say that he could not remember when a history major was not ready to graduate when he said he was ready to graduate.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:07.911
Because he made sure that they had done everything they were supposed to do.

00:31:09.106 --> 00:31:12.513
Just like when I did academic service, I said, I don't want any bunnies.

00:31:12.533 --> 00:31:13.635
I don't like surprises.

00:31:14.758 --> 00:31:19.207
I don't know what's going on.

00:31:19.227 --> 00:31:26.322
And I think now they have some of the secondaries doing the advising, and I don't think they're confident to do it.

00:31:30.082 --> 00:31:41.016
And I know this sounds like a terrible, but by the time I retired, a lot of the new people I did not know well, nor did I care, nor did I want to know them well.

00:31:42.618 --> 00:31:47.525
They were from somewhere, I don't know where they were from.

00:31:47.545 --> 00:31:57.017
During all your years in the history department, as you look back now, what were the most popular courses with the students and why?

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:05.590
Or maybe if it wasn't a course, it was an individual.

00:32:06.734 --> 00:32:08.079
Well, I've already mentioned Raffa.

00:32:08.099 --> 00:32:11.209
He was only two years in his Texas history.
