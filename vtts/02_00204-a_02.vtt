WEBVTT

00:03.490 --> 00:08.074
compare at that time, the students at UT and the students here?

00:10.597 --> 00:12.839
I'm not convinced that people at Texas were any better.

00:12.859 --> 00:14.220
I had a lot of bad students there.

00:15.001 --> 00:17.783
I had, I gave grades in the 45 and the 50 realm.

00:18.183 --> 00:19.605
I had trouble with athletes there.

00:20.165 --> 00:24.309
I had trouble with sorority girls, sorority and fraternity guys.

00:24.329 --> 00:25.190
So that was not new.

00:25.550 --> 00:26.992
So that was nothing different than the Corps.

00:28.693 --> 00:32.957
I think probably we had more bad students here

00:35.013 --> 00:37.096
because, as I recollect, it was almost open admissions.

00:37.697 --> 00:42.384
So we had more bad students here, but I think I had as many good students.

00:42.444 --> 00:48.913
I had a lot of good students, and I don't have any bad students at Texas, but I thought, again, probably more weaker students here.

00:49.514 --> 00:58.827
Do you remember any early experiences with the students that seemed unique to A&M, either plus or minus, funny or serious?

00:59.363 --> 01:03.470
Well, when a student was in trouble or having problems, you more likely had their mother and father there with you.

01:03.951 --> 01:06.215
I don't know if I've ever saw a mother and father in Texas.

01:06.496 --> 01:10.743
My three years teaching there, I'm not sure ever a parent came in to talk to me.

01:12.266 --> 01:17.435
Very quickly at A&M, I had lots of parents come in, good and bad, and indifferent.

01:17.576 --> 01:18.437
Give some examples.

01:19.158 --> 01:21.743
Well, I had a student one time that...

01:22.550 --> 01:48.743
failed the course and it cut a great deal and a knock on my door one day and there I looked up and there this man was standing there very angry looking with a wife who looked like she didn't want to be there and this student they came in and sat down his father was rather belligerent and his father was ready to take me to task and so I said well excuse me sir let me see here let me get my grade book out so I got my grade book out and I began by saying well he could hardly expect to do too well if he's cut 25 times

01:50.073 --> 01:51.835
And I started talking to the father.

01:51.876 --> 01:55.340
And as I talked to the gentleman, his face began to change.

01:56.682 --> 01:59.747
And he quit looking at me some and kept looking at the son.

02:00.728 --> 02:06.857
Before our meeting was over, he was so angry I had his son that you could see he was just furious.

02:07.197 --> 02:10.381
And his mother, the woman, the lady, was in tears.

02:11.102 --> 02:13.025
And his father told me this.

02:13.105 --> 02:14.147
I remember very, very clearly.

02:14.167 --> 02:19.354
He said, I waited tables and worked my way through A&M.

02:20.060 --> 02:21.642
I had no money at all.

02:22.763 --> 02:24.104
He said, I sent my son here.

02:24.224 --> 02:29.110
I wanted my son to not have the problems I had, deprivation I had.

02:29.130 --> 02:31.212
I want him to enjoy college.

02:32.333 --> 02:33.334
And he's done this to me.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.596
And they got up and walked out.

02:36.337 --> 02:37.959
As far as you, had he flunked out?

02:37.979 --> 02:39.941
Oh, I don't think he flunked out, but he had flunked my course.

02:39.961 --> 02:41.102
And I think he had flunked out, yes.

02:42.023 --> 02:46.708
One of the things is, Father, I talked to him some, and I said, well, maybe you need to do a little while in the military, you know.

02:47.009 --> 02:49.254
I said, some students are just too young for college.

02:49.274 --> 02:51.359
They need to perhaps settle down some.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.742
And I really felt sorry for the boy.

02:52.762 --> 02:55.789
By the time I was all over with, I knew the young man was about to get it.

02:56.391 --> 02:57.072
He really get it.

02:57.513 --> 02:58.676
And I really felt sorry for him.

02:59.077 --> 03:02.004
And the father, by the way, I bought him this, I bought him that.

03:02.044 --> 03:05.592
Didn't have a car, but everything else, you know, that you could want.

03:07.175 --> 03:19.292
In those early years, did any of the students try to do anything that was unique to A&M?

03:19.372 --> 03:21.876
Did they try to pull the wool over your eyes?

03:21.976 --> 03:24.399
Oh gosh, you always had operators.

03:24.700 --> 03:25.060
Okay.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.305
And you always had those who gave you sob stories and problems.

03:28.589 --> 03:32.714
And I think that's endemic with any, I don't think A&M students are any different than that.

03:33.615 --> 03:37.699
When I taught at Texas those three years, and we had, as teaching people, I had complete control over the class.

03:38.000 --> 03:38.600
We controlled it.

03:38.641 --> 03:39.622
We gave the grades.

03:40.322 --> 03:48.552
And I remember very clearly, when I was at Texas, I had football coaches try to interfere with grades.

03:49.153 --> 03:51.415
And again, as I said, I wasn't going to tilt windmills.

03:52.076 --> 03:53.758
I went to see Dr. Franz in those days.

03:53.878 --> 03:55.660
And I asked Dr. Franz, what should I do?

03:56.365 --> 03:58.768
And Dr. Fran said, did he fail?

03:58.788 --> 03:59.690
And I said, yes, sir.

03:59.710 --> 04:04.357
And Dr. Fran said, if he calls you back, not, he said, call, have him call me.

04:04.757 --> 04:06.139
And I never heard any more about it then.

04:10.005 --> 04:13.670
Did any of the, in the early years, did any students ever try to play any tricks on you?

04:14.371 --> 04:14.792
Oh, yes.

04:15.312 --> 04:18.918
You always had people trying to cheat and things like that, looking at all the papers.

04:19.659 --> 04:21.682
And, of course, in those days, I don't know why they did it.

04:21.702 --> 04:23.104
They had broken offices sometimes.

04:23.524 --> 04:24.786
And the breaking was so obvious.

04:25.103 --> 04:29.890
After all, if you had an exam there and they broke into your office, you very clearly weren't going to give that same exam again.

04:29.950 --> 04:34.556
Did anybody break into your office?

04:35.217 --> 04:35.637
One time.

04:35.758 --> 04:37.320
Well, no, I haven't had anyone break into my office.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.963
They broke into a number of other people's offices, never broke into mine.

04:41.265 --> 04:53.642
Several times they would, sometimes students can be so dumb, I had a number of political cartoons on my door one time, and anyone with any brains could have seen in most of those cartoons poke fun at liberals, not conservatives,

04:54.044 --> 04:59.150
And some dummy coming one day and tore them all off and wrote me notes saying he was tired of this liberal stuff.

04:59.170 --> 05:03.075
And it made me wonder what we were doing with our students here if he thought that was liberal trife.

05:03.716 --> 05:04.977
It was hardly that.

05:05.658 --> 05:14.529
Don't I remember some kind of little incident where Dr. Nance one night or one early one morning caught some students going through the dumpster?

05:15.090 --> 05:16.511
Yes, for exams.

05:16.712 --> 05:18.374
You hear that story, yeah.

05:18.394 --> 05:19.875
Yeah, but I don't remember any more about it.

05:19.935 --> 05:21.237
I just remember he did it.

05:21.698 --> 05:23.680
I also remember Dr. Nance is the one who caught the

05:24.318 --> 05:25.700
who caught the grade changes.

05:26.381 --> 05:52.232
There was a student in the registrar's office who for a fee would change your grade and there was a good bit of that going on and the way and it might have gone on forever but there was this one particular student that had been very nasty to Dr. Nance about a grade and so he stuck in Nance's mind and also Dr. Nance looked up one day and saw that this student was getting ready to graduate

05:52.702 --> 05:56.007
Well, how could this student graduate when he never passed 105, 106?

05:56.849 --> 06:04.481
And so Dr. Nast then looked into it and discovered that the student had made passing grades in 105, 106.

06:04.541 --> 06:05.302
That couldn't be.

06:05.963 --> 06:10.390
And so the investigation began, and they discovered that there was some real skullduggery going on.

06:11.078 --> 06:16.685
Let's make believe this is the first day of class in one of your survey courses.

06:17.606 --> 06:19.729
What was your routine on that first day?

06:19.809 --> 06:25.717
What kind of description of the course and what kind of rules did you try to get across that day?

06:26.217 --> 06:27.559
Didn't give out a syllabus in those days.

06:27.859 --> 06:28.721
They were not required.

06:28.761 --> 06:30.603
I didn't have a syllabus a little later on.

06:31.304 --> 06:34.588
I did hand out a little simple sheet which simply said that

06:35.007 --> 06:45.803
I expect them to come to class, that class attendants could be rewarded, and they shouldn't sleep in class, but not really very much.

06:46.244 --> 06:47.726
And I told them what the class was about.

06:48.628 --> 06:52.273
And in those days, classes were quite small, and so I encouraged question asking.

06:52.574 --> 07:19.003
one thing I always stress with them don't jump ahead it's irritating for you wait to get past the point before you ask me a question if I don't cover something I don't mind you asking about it but wait till I've had a chance to cover it but we didn't give out much in those days because there weren't any legal questions about that it's not until later on when there were so many legal questions coming up and students were prone to sue or to claim they weren't treated fairly that we started giving out very direct

07:19.557 --> 07:21.360
What was your grading system?

07:21.741 --> 07:23.063
Did you grade on the curve or?

07:24.766 --> 07:25.728
No, but yes.

07:26.629 --> 07:34.042
If you mean I would assign a certain percentage of grades and drop down to a level to pass everybody, no I did not do that.

07:34.703 --> 07:35.625
But I did use

07:36.162 --> 07:41.712
I did use attendance and things like that then to curve grades somewhat.

07:42.213 --> 07:50.087
I didn't ever approve of grading because after all classes varied and you can have a good class and have a bad class, therefore to grade a good class up to

07:50.860 --> 07:53.162
down to a bad class I thought was unfair.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.645
We had a lot of F's in those days.

07:55.685 --> 07:58.849
Back in those days it was not unusual to run 20 to 40 percent.

07:59.189 --> 08:04.214
That's why I say we had open admissions almost and we had a lot of small town kids in those days.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.797
I think nowadays our student buys large a big city.

08:07.298 --> 08:13.004
But in those days we had lots of kids from small schools that were ill prepared to come to college.

08:13.605 --> 08:16.868
And as I said up to 40 percent F's by some people.

08:17.084 --> 08:20.030
What about some of the sob stories you heard in those early years?

08:20.831 --> 08:28.646
Oh, sob stories were really, well, grandmothers died, grandfathers died.

08:28.686 --> 08:30.169
They had to go home and work on a farm.

08:31.352 --> 08:32.354
They had to go home and work.

08:33.255 --> 08:34.438
There was a death in the family.

08:35.099 --> 08:36.702
We got those things pretty regularly.

08:37.143 --> 08:37.624
I'm sick.

08:37.704 --> 08:38.265
I'm ill.

08:38.870 --> 08:44.576
I learned to be very careful on those things because I had a young lady come up one day and said she was ill and had to go home.

08:44.636 --> 08:48.801
This was on a Thanksgiving holiday, and she wanted to leave a day early.

08:49.342 --> 08:51.224
The attitude in those days was I didn't care when you cut.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.067
I didn't care whether you cut for a holiday or not.

08:54.788 --> 08:57.471
A cut was a cut, so save your cuts and do it.

08:58.092 --> 09:08.303
And she went home and died, and so that made me very careful about how I talked to students about whether they were sick or not, and that happened fairly early.

09:08.502 --> 09:09.684
when girls were admitted here.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.190
Now, Grage was posted publicly then on your door.

09:13.290 --> 09:17.697
They were posted on your door, and you could see who it was right then and there, yes.

09:18.679 --> 09:23.267
And did you ever have any experiences after they saw the posting?

09:24.549 --> 09:26.933
Oh, I've had a lot of students come in and complain one way or the other.

09:26.953 --> 09:28.375
I've never had anyone complain that they were posted.

09:28.395 --> 09:30.679
That was something you just accepted, and they were posted.

09:31.537 --> 09:34.040
Students would come in and complain about grades.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.344
I've had students complain about grades, about what they had or what they didn't have.

09:38.185 --> 09:44.373
And I tried to keep a pretty accurate grade book, and I kept attendance, which I think helped whenever a student came in.

09:44.433 --> 09:51.141
Did you ever turn to any of your colleagues in those early years for advice?

09:51.882 --> 09:53.224
Yes.

09:54.132 --> 09:55.636
I ask advice.

09:55.696 --> 10:06.606
I had probably one time with some international students and I remember Chuck McCandless back in those days was one of the assistants and so I really felt they should get an F but on the other hand

10:07.193 --> 10:15.924
I didn't want to do anything to rock the whole boat, and so I talked to McCannis about that, and I finally decided to go ahead and give him an effective WP.

10:15.964 --> 10:17.906
I wouldn't give him a passing grade, but I gave him a WP.

10:18.707 --> 10:23.213
And yes, I talked to people about possibilities, and I talked to Nance, actually.

10:23.874 --> 10:27.919
There was a case where I was giving a failing grade to a rather important person,

10:28.338 --> 10:33.625
Again, I didn't want to do anything, so I went and asked him what I should do, what he suggested I do.

10:34.627 --> 10:41.917
And he said, well, is there any way that that person can pass if you lower your grading system?

10:41.957 --> 10:43.720
And I said, I'll have to pass everybody.

10:44.621 --> 10:47.205
He said, well, pay that student, and I did.

10:48.026 --> 10:49.688
So Dr. Nance would not want to be bought.

10:51.153 --> 11:00.124
In those early years, do you remember any board member or politician or other public figure trying to pull a string?

11:00.825 --> 11:02.467
No, I never had that.

11:02.588 --> 11:09.516
I had faculty members, football coaches, and people like that at times.

11:09.556 --> 11:14.022
Yes, I had a number of those, but I never had anyone on that level, no.

11:14.288 --> 11:16.371
Give some examples that you remember.

11:16.431 --> 11:29.090
Well, I had several instances where faculty members called and talked to me about their child, about how their child should have gotten a better grade, or why didn't they get a better grade, and things like that then.

11:29.691 --> 11:39.486
And when I first came here, Bud Denton was the football man.

11:39.652 --> 11:43.257
He always came by to talk to you before everything happened.

11:43.277 --> 11:46.641
And so you never felt that Bud was trying to finagle grades from you.

11:47.302 --> 11:52.229
But some of the people following Bud very definitely tried to do that then.

11:53.150 --> 11:58.918
Did some people representing athletics ever try to get you to give a student grade they did not deserve?

11:58.938 --> 11:59.359
Yeah.

11:59.859 --> 12:02.683
I've talked about couldn't they do this, do that, you know, important people.

12:03.284 --> 12:05.968
Bud Denton never did it, but I had others do that.

12:06.368 --> 12:08.511
Now, that was only a period of time for a while there.

12:08.930 --> 12:10.552
And then as time went on, that did not occur.

12:11.413 --> 12:17.079
Now, you mentioned a while ago you got involved taking up tickets and so forth, the football game.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.302
How did, how and when did that start?

12:20.023 --> 12:27.952
Well, several of my colleagues, I recollect Monroe and Bayless were already doing it, and so I talked to them so that I would do it, so I asked and got on then.

12:28.753 --> 12:32.517
That would have been, I guess, 67, 66, very early I started doing it.

12:32.537 --> 12:33.718
What was your first task?

12:34.439 --> 12:36.341
My first task was taking up student tickets.

12:36.682 --> 12:37.823
That was the lowest job.

12:38.630 --> 12:44.620
And I did that, and then I was voted, and luckily I went into the president's box.

12:45.221 --> 12:47.404
And I worked in the president's box for a long time.

12:47.685 --> 12:49.448
Do you remember with whom that started?

12:50.950 --> 12:52.072
Well, Rudder was president, yeah.

12:52.112 --> 12:52.853
Rudder was still president.

12:52.873 --> 12:53.634
Yes, Rudder was president.

12:54.155 --> 13:01.347
I can remember so clearly that game where Texas beat us the worst ever beating us was 50 to something.

13:01.580 --> 13:18.026
Texas had a really good team that year, and that must have been at 67, 68, and the Texas band and Rudder got up and when the Texas band was marching and made some Rudder march, they're not going to beat us in football, they're trying to beat us in band, you know, and that's a long time ago.

13:18.526 --> 13:23.234
Do you remember any Rudder press box experiences, plus or minus?

13:23.875 --> 13:28.482
No, Rudder was very friendly to press box, and I can remember he'd have particularly

13:29.693 --> 13:35.383
Uh, Rudder would, Rudder sat a good bit you see in the press, that was a Board of Regents box.

13:36.157 --> 13:39.660
But in those days, that big top thing had not been added yet.

13:40.041 --> 13:42.183
That was not added yet.

13:42.243 --> 13:46.186
They added a second deck, you know, and that wasn't that good of a thing up there.

13:46.246 --> 13:47.147
Remember, you're working.

13:47.808 --> 13:52.032
And so Reuters spent a lot of time down in what has now become the Board of Regents box.

13:52.052 --> 13:54.814
It was the President's box back in those days, if I'm remembering correctly.

13:55.215 --> 13:59.699
That box A and B on the 50-yard line on the west side was called the President's box.

13:59.719 --> 14:05.404
It's now the Board of Regents box, and the President is upstairs in that big fancy one up there.

14:05.384 --> 14:10.489
Because this is before the second deck was built, certainly before the third.

14:10.829 --> 14:10.929
Yeah.

14:10.949 --> 14:21.719
We won, well, we won conference in 67, and then that was planned then to add the second deck, and then the second deck was added, and then the third deck was a good bit later then.

14:23.200 --> 14:29.586
Any memories of that 67 year and the excitement that young Coach Stallings created?

14:29.766 --> 14:33.990
Yes, and I went to, we went to Cotton Bowl and saw A&M beat Alabama,

14:34.612 --> 14:36.414
And colder and blue blazes, as I remember.

14:36.454 --> 14:40.218
And we barely won it, you know.

14:40.278 --> 14:43.402
We were on the ropes on one game.

14:43.422 --> 14:46.105
I remember we were almost about ready to lose to TCU.

14:46.125 --> 14:53.112
But Billy Hobbs, who was a famous football player, TCU was driving for another touchdown, which I think finished the game.

14:53.132 --> 14:55.815
Because back in those days, we didn't score these 30 and 40 points.

14:56.576 --> 14:59.559
And Billy Hobbs intercepted a pass.

14:59.740 --> 15:03.724
And we went on to score and cut the score down, and then we went on to win.

15:04.548 --> 15:09.914
Did you ever have any personal communication relations with Stallings?

15:10.675 --> 15:19.325
Well, I spoke to him, and I, one year we were, Bob Calvert and I were invited to go with the team over to play Texas, and we did that.

15:20.346 --> 15:30.758
And other than seeing, back in those days, because everyone went to coffee, you know, in the old Memorial Student Center Union, and you saw Stallings there, and you might speak to him, but I was not close to him, no.

15:32.003 --> 15:34.647
What about the basketball coach at that point?

15:34.787 --> 15:35.648
Got to know him better.

15:35.668 --> 15:36.649
Describe Shelby.

15:37.411 --> 15:46.042
Well, Shelby might be referred to as being folksy and kind of down-to-earth, and he cultivated that idea, a good old country boy and fisherman.

15:46.824 --> 15:58.380
And I think that in the early days, when we were so good in basketball, he, Shelby, deliberately, I think, recruited the type of players he thought he could work with.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.863
And back in those days, I think it worked very well.

16:01.298 --> 16:09.588
I think if I had to say anything about Shelby, I thought he had the possibility to take good people and make them into very good people.

16:09.608 --> 16:10.890
He got the most out of his players.

16:11.410 --> 16:14.674
I'm not sure if Shelby ever knew how to coach really good players.

16:14.735 --> 16:17.458
I think that they're really good players, Shelby couldn't understand.

16:17.478 --> 16:20.241
But he could take a mediocre player and get the most out of him.

16:20.802 --> 16:22.744
And you began working also at basketball.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.187
I worked at basketball very early, yes.

16:25.207 --> 16:28.892
Describe a game in G. Riley White in those days.

16:29.412 --> 16:31.295
Well, we frequently had sellouts, of course.

16:31.356 --> 16:33.199
We frequently had 7,000 people there.

16:34.642 --> 16:35.423
It was noisy.

16:35.944 --> 16:37.046
Every team never talked.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.913
Talked about how noisy it was at G. Raleigh White.

16:43.838 --> 16:44.620
Why was it noisy?

16:45.822 --> 16:49.108
Well, you know, just kind of a box in there, and there's nothing to absorb the

16:49.814 --> 16:52.498
There was no kind of insulation up above, just steel girders.

16:52.738 --> 16:55.222
Was there any musical organization?

16:55.482 --> 16:56.464
Yes, the band played.

16:56.504 --> 16:57.926
Of course, the band, we were unique in that.

16:57.946 --> 16:59.088
The band came and played.

16:59.408 --> 17:00.971
That's before they had the girls dancing now.

17:00.991 --> 17:04.516
There weren't any girls dancing, but the band played, and it played loud.

17:04.536 --> 17:11.506
It sat in the very southeast corner of the, of G. Riley White.

17:12.167 --> 17:14.811
And of course, the students were led in yells.

17:14.831 --> 17:16.834
It was an orderly thing.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.724
It was noisy.

17:19.004 --> 17:22.208
Do you remember ever any disorder in one of those?

17:23.249 --> 17:23.569
Yes.

17:24.631 --> 17:28.195
One in particular was the Baylor ball game back in that time when there was a fight.

17:29.296 --> 17:33.281
One of the Baylor ball players, I don't remember his name now, was known to be a feisty player.

17:34.102 --> 17:37.466
And one of the Yankees was going down for a layup, and the Baylor guy trailed him.

17:37.486 --> 17:40.990
And the Baylor guy did not try to block the ball.

17:41.110 --> 17:42.872
The Baylor boy blocked the guy.

17:43.460 --> 17:49.286
And unfortunately for him, in those days, right there underneath that basket, all the athletes sat.

17:50.428 --> 17:59.858
And people think it was the athletes who did it, but one of the big basketball players back in the other days who could play football, really Bob Barnett was trailing the play.

18:00.538 --> 18:06.885
When he saw his comrade really just cold-cotted by this Baylor boy, everything got him angry.

18:07.666 --> 18:11.290
And so he then proceeded to level the Baylor guy.

18:11.658 --> 18:18.911
and it was a bench-empting brawl kind of and it was on TV and no one really could be sure of what happened because it all happened so quickly.

18:18.931 --> 18:19.732
I helped to break it up.

18:19.792 --> 18:35.320
I was working right there and so I went out on the court and helped separate people out and I saw it all happen pretty quickly and actually the worst damage was probably done because the Baylor kid was hit and then his head hit the floor and that's a hard floor.

18:35.806 --> 18:50.026
I've always thought that Billy Bob ought to have a tape of that fight that he would play at his beer hall, or whatever it's called, up at Fort Worth as you walk in, so you'd know that this is the same Billy Bob.

18:51.107 --> 18:55.653
Who were Shelby's favorite teams to beat, do you think, during that era?

18:55.894 --> 18:57.075
His favorite competitors?

18:57.095 --> 18:59.498
Well, he hated Arkansas, so he just liked Arkansas.

18:59.899 --> 19:02.142
But, of course, he had a winning record against Texas.

19:02.162 --> 19:04.986
He's had a good winning record against Texas.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.989
And there's no love lost.

19:08.009 --> 19:15.060
While Arkansas and Texas may have been the main enemies, in a way, there wasn't much love lost between us and Baylor either.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.022
They were so close.

19:17.464 --> 19:21.430
And A&M had been involved in a number of altercations with Baylor.

19:22.352 --> 19:25.036
But I think he particularly enjoyed beating Eddie Sutton.

19:25.116 --> 19:25.477
Yeah.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.139
And then who was that Texas coach?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.141
Abe Lemons.

19:28.161 --> 19:28.922
Abe Lemons, yeah.

19:28.942 --> 19:29.623
Abe Lemons, yeah.

19:29.992 --> 19:34.639
And Sutton hated to play at the A&M, you know.

19:36.121 --> 19:37.683
He said it was the worst place in the world to play.

19:38.344 --> 19:43.010
All right, for on the night of a basketball game, what was your routine?

19:43.050 --> 19:44.412
By what time did you get there?

19:44.933 --> 19:55.388
I had to be there by 5 o'clock most of the time, or 5.30, so I frequently, I stayed in the office, then I walked over and ate at the MSC, and I went to the game then.

19:56.309 --> 19:57.250
And took up tickets?

19:57.411 --> 19:57.791
Took up tickets.

19:57.811 --> 19:59.053
And then when would that

19:59.371 --> 20:00.112
We didn't take up tickets.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.313
We punched.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.915
Back in those days, you had a card that you punched, and you punched it.

20:04.095 --> 20:08.960
And then what time would that function be over relative to the game?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.161
The game started at 7.30.

20:10.601 --> 20:11.942
So you could quit that?

20:12.243 --> 20:16.266
No, I had to stay through the whole game, really.

20:16.286 --> 20:16.687
Oh, really?

20:17.227 --> 20:22.512
But generally speaking, we were free after the fourth quarter or the last ten minutes of the ballgame.

20:22.532 --> 20:23.993
But did you come in and sit down?

20:24.033 --> 20:24.214
Yes.

20:24.474 --> 20:25.154
We rotated.

20:25.655 --> 20:26.716
We had to keep somebody in the door.

20:26.836 --> 20:27.977
Once the tickets were taken up,

20:28.463 --> 20:30.466
We'd rotate off and we'd go watch.

20:31.568 --> 20:36.755
We might have as many as three to four people on the student door, so we could leave one or two there and go watch the game.

20:37.276 --> 20:38.398
Now, you mentioned parking.

20:38.478 --> 20:42.584
Describe parking situation for a history faculty member in the early years.

20:42.704 --> 20:43.585
Oh, it was terrible.

20:44.026 --> 20:47.831
We just drove up to Denego Hall and parked our car and got out and walked in the office.

20:48.572 --> 20:49.654
It was terrible in those days.

20:49.674 --> 20:50.916
Do you remember a parking sticker?

20:51.116 --> 20:52.378
Did we have stickers then?

20:54.097 --> 20:54.738
I don't remember.

20:55.018 --> 20:56.741
Come to think about it, I really don't remember.

20:57.021 --> 20:59.565
But there wasn't a single reserve slot, was there?

20:59.585 --> 21:00.266
I don't think so, no.

21:00.306 --> 21:01.367
Dr. Nance just parked.

21:01.387 --> 21:02.189
He got there so early.

21:02.509 --> 21:06.375
He had a great big old Chrysler's, I remember.

21:06.395 --> 21:07.616
And he just parked it.

21:07.797 --> 21:08.918
And you parked wherever you could.

21:10.260 --> 21:12.223
And I don't remember that lot

21:12.811 --> 21:16.215
being so full that we couldn't... No, it wasn't, yeah.

21:16.235 --> 21:21.181
On weekends, students living in a hard hall, that dorm right there would frequently come into it.

21:21.622 --> 21:24.345
But I seldom had a problem getting any parking place.

21:25.587 --> 21:25.947
I agree.

21:26.748 --> 21:28.991
All right, let's see.

21:29.051 --> 21:30.633
Now let's go back to family.

21:31.494 --> 21:36.881
Joanne comes bringing son number one and son number two.

21:37.161 --> 21:37.842
She was born here.

21:38.102 --> 21:39.624
And when does she go to work here?

21:40.545 --> 21:41.046
Well,

21:42.038 --> 21:52.511
Like many women, I don't know, post-pregnancy, women have, I understand, as you keep saying, women frequently have a letdown after they have a baby.

21:53.412 --> 21:55.955
And she decided maybe she needed something to do.

21:55.995 --> 21:58.398
So first she took in typing.

21:58.518 --> 21:59.479
She was doing some typing.

21:59.900 --> 22:02.823
She knew somebody engineering, and she did typing.

22:03.644 --> 22:06.848
And in the beginning, she was doing a lot of typing for international students.

22:07.435 --> 22:11.782
And that drove her a while because she, not only was she typing, she was editing.

22:12.282 --> 22:13.544
And she wasn't being paid to edit.

22:13.564 --> 22:14.726
She was being just paid to type.

22:15.227 --> 22:20.936
And so she decided at a point that if she could do that much work, she might as well go to work.

22:20.956 --> 22:24.461
So she went to work half time for the engineering college.

22:26.063 --> 22:30.490
And then an opening came up in the Research Foundation, which was integrated, a part of

22:30.757 --> 22:32.820
the engineering college at that time.

22:33.181 --> 22:39.030
And so she went to work for the Research Foundation, first half-time, then three-fourths time, then full-time.

22:39.971 --> 22:43.076
And her first duties was what, as a half-time?

22:43.516 --> 22:45.359
Her first duties was simply general clerical work.

22:45.379 --> 22:46.240
Just general clerical.

22:46.821 --> 22:48.644
No real responsibility, just general clerical.

22:48.664 --> 22:49.545
And about when was that?

22:50.367 --> 22:54.012
Oh, I suppose about sixty, probably sixty-five.

22:54.753 --> 22:57.878
See, our boy was born in sixty-four, and she took in typing for

22:58.094 --> 22:59.017
for a year or so.

22:59.658 --> 23:06.016
And she works, has worked for them ever since and became the, what's her current title?

23:06.036 --> 23:08.242
She is the president and our general CEO.

23:08.443 --> 23:10.709
When did she assume that responsibility?

23:10.729 --> 23:11.492
About 10 years ago.

23:11.552 --> 23:13.116
She'd been president about 10 years.

23:13.096 --> 23:16.661
So she worked her way up from a part-time... From part-time.

23:17.322 --> 23:19.947
To the president, yeah.

23:19.967 --> 23:20.387
In 20 years?

23:21.088 --> 23:21.950
Yes.

23:21.970 --> 23:23.432
She's worked for 30 years now.

23:23.812 --> 23:25.395
No, but within 20 years.

23:26.977 --> 23:30.743
And I want to interview her about sometime in the future.

23:30.783 --> 23:35.931
Did you ever get the impression that she ever thought...

23:36.350 --> 23:40.495
that she was given any advantage because she was female.

23:41.096 --> 23:44.139
No, I think she really felt that it was the opposite, really.

23:44.159 --> 23:47.503
She wasn't being treated fairly because she was a female, you know.

23:47.523 --> 23:49.005
And if anything, it was a disadvantage.

23:49.025 --> 23:50.446
Yeah, a disadvantage, yes.

23:50.466 --> 23:52.309
In that era.

23:52.329 --> 23:58.476
And the fact that you were a faculty member had nothing to do with her getting that job over there.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.278
No, nothing to do with it.

24:00.298 --> 24:03.842
That's what I, that was neither a plus nor a minus.

24:03.822 --> 24:08.086
All right, back to the history department.

24:09.067 --> 24:17.514
You were a full-time faculty member teaching, teaching, teaching, and you finished your degree, your doctoral dissertation when?

24:17.534 --> 24:17.814
1967.

24:17.835 --> 24:18.075
67.

24:18.095 --> 24:22.399
66, no, yeah, 66, yeah.

24:22.639 --> 24:27.123
And did that change your work assignment in any way?

24:27.163 --> 24:27.583
No, not at all.

24:28.704 --> 24:32.968
And so Dr. Nance retires

24:33.202 --> 24:34.215
About when?

24:35.188 --> 24:35.938
Oh gosh.

24:37.808 --> 24:38.649
as department head?

24:39.370 --> 24:45.119
We moved into academic building, and he retired shortly thereafter.

24:45.639 --> 24:47.182
So, what's that?

24:47.202 --> 24:48.223
Middle 70s, I guess.

24:48.343 --> 24:49.124
Okay.

24:49.565 --> 24:52.189
So it's maybe 10 years at least.

24:52.209 --> 24:52.429
Yes.

24:52.730 --> 24:55.734
He's head of the department for 12, 15 years after I come here.

24:56.375 --> 25:03.505
As he nears retirement, did his routine of leadership change much?

25:03.525 --> 25:04.226
Yes, a lot.

25:04.987 --> 25:06.229
When I first came,

25:06.209 --> 25:21.106
it was more individual decisions and pretty harsh like being called in and told I couldn't wear short pants and a number of people were let go because they got crosswise with him.

25:21.847 --> 25:34.181
One department member was let go mainly because he kept wearing t-shirts to class and Dr. Nance thought that was inappropriate and individual people were let go.

25:34.221 --> 25:35.743
How much he consulted on that

25:36.162 --> 25:47.994
I have no idea, but I do know that by the time he left the department, when he left being head, of course he worked a while longer thereafter, he was consulting.

25:48.394 --> 25:50.336
I know he was consulting a lot with people.

25:51.498 --> 25:53.840
Who would have been the ones he would consult with much?

25:53.860 --> 25:58.465
Boyd Taylor, Herb Lang, Claude Hall, perhaps even you.

25:59.986 --> 26:03.049
He would go into, I know the full professors.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.612
I do know the full professors were talked to.

26:05.980 --> 26:11.547
and questions were asked about doing certain things on hiring and firing and things like that then.

26:12.749 --> 26:19.618
Now, during his years, early years, when did you find out what courses you were teaching at what hours?

26:19.958 --> 26:22.641
Frequently the day before class, yes.

26:22.661 --> 26:23.422
Not very early.

26:24.344 --> 26:27.508
Do you remember any years in which you got a real surprise?

26:28.028 --> 26:35.498
Yes, I had been teaching 105, 106 forever, and all the courses I could teach were taken, Texas history, the Old South,

26:36.170 --> 26:41.677
the early national period, which were my strengths, where I had people in them who were going to stay there a while.

26:42.899 --> 26:46.764
And we had a gentleman here and he left.

26:47.665 --> 26:50.569
And he taught a course in those days called Roosevelt to Roosevelt.

26:50.869 --> 26:51.470
It was 310.

26:52.171 --> 26:53.413
Roosevelt to Roosevelt.

26:53.433 --> 26:54.594
And he leaves very suddenly.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.096
He gets a job and decides to leave.

26:57.618 --> 27:05.248
And I don't know, just a few days before classes begin, Dr. Vance called me in and said, Victor, would you like to teach

27:06.427 --> 27:06.988
310.

27:07.909 --> 27:08.770
Well I was tired.

27:08.870 --> 27:09.470
I didn't know anything.

27:09.550 --> 27:12.654
I had never had a course hardly after 1900.

27:12.674 --> 27:23.446
Nothing had happened since the Civil War and so of course I said eagerly yes sir and I went home right then and there and began to read and I taught 310 for a good many years.

27:23.986 --> 27:30.814
Then when Dr. Monroe left the department I then fell heir to

27:31.553 --> 27:39.701
450 the Old South and also by that time Texas history had really increased and we were adding a whole bunch of sections.

27:39.761 --> 27:44.666
I won't say why it increased but it did and so I started teaching Texas history as well.

27:45.167 --> 27:47.049
You say you won't say or you don't know why?

27:47.189 --> 27:47.890
Well I know why.

27:47.950 --> 27:53.175
Why?

27:53.195 --> 28:00.042
Dr. Nance was a strict disciplinarian and he ran classes really tough

28:00.646 --> 28:04.772
And students didn't want to take Texas history unless they had to.

28:05.533 --> 28:10.841
So many people who took Texas history were those students certifying to teach.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.085
And they had to take it.

28:14.287 --> 28:16.610
Therefore, the classes remained fairly small.

28:19.274 --> 28:29.269
When Dr. Nance retired, there was a, and we started offering Texas history to other people, including me, we taught it less strictly.

28:29.941 --> 28:32.526
and we taught it more like we taught 105.

28:32.566 --> 28:33.748
Dr. Nance, it was 326.

28:33.788 --> 28:41.102
It was an advanced course and Dr. Nance taught it almost like a graduate course until students were deathly afraid of it for some reason.

28:42.003 --> 28:46.932
And when the rest of us began teaching it, we taught like a survey course and all of a sudden students wanted to take it.

28:47.273 --> 28:48.996
Also, it was ruled

28:49.533 --> 28:50.334
a ruling was made.

28:50.574 --> 28:57.964
In the early days, the ruling was you must take 105, 106 to fulfill the state requirement.

28:57.984 --> 29:03.031
If you remember, the state requirement was you must have six hours and at least three of basic American history.

29:03.071 --> 29:09.199
And we here at A&M, and I think that was mainly Dr. Nance, construed that to mean it must be 105, 106.

29:09.600 --> 29:14.967
When Dr. Nance left, those powers that be began to look at any

29:15.655 --> 29:17.858
American history course would suffice.

29:18.439 --> 29:20.962
In the early days, we said if one was a survey, you'd take anything you want.

29:20.982 --> 29:25.047
And Texas history then was looked upon as a survey course, and a lot of people started taking it.

29:25.327 --> 29:27.350
We were teaching many five courses when I retired.

29:27.750 --> 29:37.863
In those early years, what were supposedly, according to the students, what were supposedly the easiest and hardest history courses?

29:39.405 --> 29:43.030
Well, Texas history was considered one of the hardest, and it was

29:44.917 --> 29:46.219
really tough in many ways.

29:49.183 --> 29:54.051
Many students and I want to take medieval history because of problems there.

29:56.354 --> 30:01.121
Most popular classes would have been Civil War and Reconstruction under Ashcraft.

30:01.522 --> 30:07.571
It's not that Ashcraft was easy because he was not, but he taught it in a very pleasant way and he enjoyed it.

30:10.375 --> 30:11.397
Herb Lang taught

30:12.035 --> 30:18.185
a Western history actually at the Frontier and that was a very popular course and students enjoyed that.

30:19.206 --> 30:26.718
And I think Claude Hall also, his class on Jacksonville America was quite popular at the time.

30:26.879 --> 30:39.679
And the Old South taught by Hathaway Monroe was a popular course but all those courses were taught in a general way and there was not a lot of discipline in them and the readings were reasonable.

30:39.929 --> 30:42.252
What about the courses taught by Ivy League Taylor?

30:43.434 --> 30:46.979
Well, students who got to know him liked him.

30:47.680 --> 30:51.987
But most students were deathly afraid of him because of the way he acted.

30:52.147 --> 31:00.860
And in class, he ran class really, you know, he was really a, well, he was simply the boss.

31:01.621 --> 31:03.263
Autonomy, that was it.

31:03.924 --> 31:05.226
And that frightened students.

31:06.168 --> 31:09.092
In reality, if you took the class and got to know him,

31:09.460 --> 31:10.883
Lloyd, he really wasn't that bad.

31:10.903 --> 31:15.232
He had a bad bark and he kept small classes that way.

31:16.374 --> 31:23.749
His term papers were fearsome because he required you to write and to make corrections and that's what scared law students away.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.895
Why did they call him Ivy League?
