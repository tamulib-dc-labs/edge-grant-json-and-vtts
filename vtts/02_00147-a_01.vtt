WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:13.678
Myself from A&M and Dr. Hebel Hoff from Baylor College of Medicine.

00:13.699 --> 00:15.882
And so we wrote a proposal.

00:16.122 --> 00:23.473
We met stuck away in a glass building over on

00:24.736 --> 00:37.181
Over on old Post Oak Road or somewhere for days, planning, dreaming up how to do a college of medicine at A&M.

00:37.441 --> 00:45.377
And using Baylor as the clinical, for the clinical years at A&M,

00:45.357 --> 00:47.080
for the basic years.

00:47.761 --> 00:55.173
And that proposal, the first proposal is now in the archives at A&M.

00:55.293 --> 01:02.686
I remember giving them a copy and it has pictures of everybody and it's involved and all these things.

01:02.786 --> 01:11.500
And so Dr. Hoff was appointed the first acting dean of the College of Medicine at Texas A&M University.

01:11.480 --> 01:16.088
This, again, is something that's probably not recorded or known anywhere.

01:16.850 --> 01:28.872
Jim Knight was the first dean, but Hebel moved up here and lived in an apartment here and was the first acting dean of the College of Medicine.

01:29.854 --> 01:32.779
And so we prepared a proposal

01:33.097 --> 01:42.921
to go to the American Medical Association Committee on Education for that medical school.

01:44.183 --> 01:57.802
We prepared it, and we had to stand reviews by the Council on Education for the program.

01:57.822 --> 02:04.892
And the one that headed that first reviewing team, or that was head of the American

02:04.872 --> 02:11.242
Medical Association Educational Counsel was a person by the name of Dr. Jimmy Schofield.

02:12.705 --> 02:24.484
And Dr. Schofield had been an associate dean for, at Baylor College of Medicine, and this I would not discredit anybody, but

02:24.464 --> 02:30.979
it seemed that Jimmy had some problem at Baylor and was released.

02:31.501 --> 02:34.267
Now, I thank that.

02:34.287 --> 02:40.903
Now, I don't want to, I wouldn't, but anyhow, Dr. Schofield was on the reviewing team and he,

02:41.356 --> 02:50.119
had decided that there were not enough beds in the Texas Medical Center for A&M to have use it.

02:51.141 --> 02:58.099
And that's, of course, there's more beds down there, and they've since built another whole medical school there.

02:58.079 --> 03:04.289
But anyhow, we had to come back and approach it in another way.

03:04.309 --> 03:22.619
And Congressman Owen Teague entered into the picture, and he said, well, we'll just do that with the Veterans Administration Hospital in Temple.

03:22.799 --> 03:25.403
We'll use that as a teaching hospital.

03:25.383 --> 03:30.448
And he appropriated $10 million for that initial

03:31.036 --> 03:33.760
look-see into that collaboration.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.586
Let me, this is a note to the typist.

03:38.527 --> 03:59.980
As dean of faculties at that time, I was working on the law school proposal, but was in the office next door to Dick Winerti, who was the key person here relating to the A&M administration about the medical school.

03:59.960 --> 04:12.231
And one day, somewhere, I happened to find reference to the fact that Dr. Schofield had been on the Baylor staff and had left under circumstances not of his choosing.

04:12.346 --> 04:32.160
and suggested that perhaps that was the difficulty we were really facing in not being able to get a tentative accreditation by the American Association for Medical Education, and suggested that maybe if we did not

04:32.140 --> 04:39.331
tie our request to Baylor that maybe we could get our tentative accreditation.

04:41.194 --> 04:58.502
The local administration decided to drop the Baylor link and our accreditation, that's not the right word, right phrase, anyway, we got authority to begin

04:58.482 --> 05:13.739
quickly by linking only with the VA and Scott and White in Temple instead of having a three-way arrangement of Scott and White and Baylor.

05:14.940 --> 05:22.448
But this is a dream that might have been if we could have had the Baylor link also, end of note.

05:23.575 --> 05:38.083
So after that, after Mr. T got involved and he put the money in for the VA, we also started working with the people at Temple, Scott and White.

05:39.305 --> 05:46.258
And we found opposition all the way along the road to A&M having a medical school.

05:47.960 --> 05:56.265
Well, Scott and White thought that it would take too much of their staff time to train

05:58.034 --> 06:00.637
medical students.

06:00.657 --> 06:13.450
And then, so Dr. McNerdy was to take care of that, and then we were getting opposition locally from medical doctors in the community that they didn't want a school here.

06:13.471 --> 06:21.239
And so I was given the task of working with the local medical association, trying to get their approval.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.723
And there was a doctor, T.O.

06:24.743 --> 06:27.045
Walton was

06:27.025 --> 06:28.908
president of that group.

06:29.008 --> 06:43.752
And so I finally got them to agree that, you know, it would be a good thing that we weren't going to train lots of doctors here and put them out in competition to them, that they'd have access to medical library and seminars and programs and all that.

06:43.985 --> 06:53.356
We got that approval, Dr. Venerdi, working with the people at Scott and White, finally got them to agree to it.

06:53.717 --> 07:04.450
And so, with all the things in place, we got First Medical School approved.

07:04.730 --> 07:07.073
I got a call one morning.

07:07.188 --> 07:21.501
that it was approved, and we need to start taking students in about two or three months, and they wanted me to design a medical facility, teaching facility, and wanted it by noon.

07:21.700 --> 07:40.350
So I went to the Owen E. Teague building, took the, I believe it was the first floor, maybe the second floor in the basement, drew up pathology labs, a lecture lab, a physiology laboratories,

07:40.330 --> 07:46.377
administrative facilities and drafted that by noon.

07:47.959 --> 07:53.865
And they started to work on it the next week.

07:53.885 --> 08:05.839
And in about two, two and a half months, we had a medical basic medical school in the old ET building.

08:05.859 --> 08:07.781
And do you have a comment?

08:08.201 --> 08:08.882
No, no.

08:08.902 --> 08:09.763
OK.

08:09.743 --> 08:19.842
And so that was the first medical school, and Dr. Knight was hired as the dean.

08:20.503 --> 08:27.516
Dr. Hoff having, since it didn't involve Baylor, if it had involved Baylor, Dr. Hoff would have been the dean.

08:28.154 --> 08:35.087
instead of acting dean, but when it got involved with Scott and White and VA, it was changed.

08:35.107 --> 08:42.000
So that was the beginning of the medical school at Texas A&M and the Institute of Comparative Medicine.

08:43.603 --> 08:47.631
And it all went back to Ed McMurray.

08:48.016 --> 09:09.248
Now, along this same feeling of developing medicine here, and as Dr. Monroe said, the president of A&M wanted, his thoughts were that A&M, he wanted to

09:09.683 --> 09:19.577
get all other universities, colleges, relationships removed from Texas A&M University's system.

09:20.839 --> 09:38.123
That included Prairie View and Arlington and Tarleton and everybody, and have a complete university at College Station, which would include all of the colleges necessary for a university, including law and medicine.

09:38.143 --> 09:39.184
Now this was Rudder?

09:39.367 --> 09:40.871
No, Jack Kenny.

09:42.635 --> 09:53.022
And he and Dr. Monroe will know as much or more than I on the law side since I was in the medical side of it.

09:53.828 --> 10:06.208
that Dr. Williams told me one time that the South Texas Law School in Houston had agreed to become a part of the A&M system.

10:07.430 --> 10:11.517
We had no opposition from anybody at that time, as far as I know.

10:11.497 --> 10:16.426
But they would not move from Houston, Texas to College Station.

10:17.267 --> 10:35.479
And again, it was his vision that all of this would be located under one umbrella on one campus, and we would not have to share any available funds or any other resources with anybody else.

10:35.459 --> 10:38.463
And that was his vision.

10:38.583 --> 10:57.889
If he could see us today with the sprawling, administrative, unwieldy organizational structure that we're under with about 10 or 15 universities and dental schools and

10:57.869 --> 11:08.501
Everything else, President Williams would certainly turn flips, but we have now diluted our resources tremendously.

11:08.541 --> 11:13.326
But anyhow, we were not able to bring that law school.

11:13.346 --> 11:15.889
We did get the medical school.

11:16.089 --> 11:23.978
Again, if Mr. Rutter had not been so set in his ways, we would have had Baylor College of Medicine.

11:24.346 --> 11:35.007
And if Dr. Williams hadn't been so adamant about the location of the College of Law, we would have a College of Law at the College Station.

11:35.949 --> 11:42.482
And we'd have been self-contained, and I don't know if we'd been better off or not.

11:43.083 --> 11:45.949
Let me, this is another note to the typist to add.

11:47.077 --> 12:10.722
It is my understanding, that means I'm not positive, I don't have any proof of it, but it is my understanding that one of the straws that broke the animals back in the negotiations about South Texas College of Law was not only that they didn't want to move,

12:11.258 --> 12:28.322
but also that at the state level, some authority said that if A&M did take up the South Texas College of Law, that A&M could never offer law courses outside Harris County.

12:29.281 --> 12:32.846
And I do know that Dr. Williams wanted there to be law here.

12:33.927 --> 12:37.612
And so it did not come about.

12:39.134 --> 12:49.028
But the medical arrangement came about because of so much good work by so many people and

12:49.767 --> 12:57.276
the cost to the taxpayers of Texas for an additional medical school was very, very reasonable.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.298
End of note.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.601
Now, J.D., back to your own story.

13:02.142 --> 13:08.049
You went down there in the early 60s to Baylor, and you came back up here when, full-time?

13:08.830 --> 13:13.536
I came, I put in for an extension of my leave.

13:14.957 --> 13:19.723
I had been granted a two-year leave absence, and I was

13:19.990 --> 13:22.333
enjoying everything in Houston.

13:23.814 --> 13:26.477
I hadn't quite finished my dissertation.

13:28.119 --> 13:47.179
And the Medical Center, going back to the stimulus, being in the Texas Medical Center as I was, and being the first veterinarian and somehow having developed a real fine rapport and respect amongst all the physicians,

13:48.357 --> 14:01.640
They were just totally amazed that a veterinarian could do what a veterinarian could do, everything from infectious disease to dental to surgery to everything else and they were beginning to specialize themselves more and more.

14:03.243 --> 14:13.200
Anyhow, they wanted me to stay and I wanted to stay and I wanted to finish my, complete all my dissertation and some of the

14:13.838 --> 14:26.703
things that I had started in the medical center and I was also working with the VA and MD Anderson at the same time in the rehabilitation center and the dental school.

14:27.745 --> 14:29.468
And so

14:30.967 --> 14:36.499
I asked for an extension and could not get it.

14:37.742 --> 14:47.203
And I understand why Dr. Burns would not ask for an extension because he said I had to be back in College Station on June the 1st.

14:48.567 --> 15:04.753
because, for one thing, they were starting the trimester program, which meant instead of four years of veterinary training, it took three years of veterinary training going year-round, and I had to be here to initiate that trimester program.

15:04.733 --> 15:18.734
which meant starting at 7 o'clock every morning with lectures and lecture a half day and then laboratory every afternoon, again with no help.

15:18.934 --> 15:20.297
And he couldn't do it.

15:20.357 --> 15:25.905
I mean, so I had to come back to help start the trimester program.

15:27.007 --> 15:31.213
And I really hated to leave.

15:31.193 --> 15:42.730
the medical center with all the seminars and the doctors that I worked with and the excitement and being, I guess the main thing was just being accepted.

15:42.810 --> 15:47.917
I mean, I could go anywhere in the medical center, into any surgical suite.

15:48.037 --> 15:53.585
I was doing autopsies on human subjects at Ben Taub every Wednesday.

15:53.605 --> 15:56.830
I did all the autopsies, just everything.

15:57.265 --> 16:13.755
was really exciting and, I don't know, it's just such a dynamic situation in that medical center and it's still that way.

16:13.735 --> 16:33.078
And that really piqued my interest in academia and the fact that I still have faculty appointments at Baylor College of Medicine, at MD Anderson, and still have ongoing activities.

16:34.360 --> 16:41.008
But I came back here, helped Brayne Medical School here,

16:41.326 --> 16:45.133
When you came back, what was your initial assignment?

16:45.694 --> 16:52.687
Well, when I came back, I was still an instructor, assistant professor, I guess.

16:53.088 --> 16:54.129
Same department head?

16:54.149 --> 16:55.492
Same department head.

16:55.732 --> 17:01.022
And then I guess it was the next 67, I guess so.

17:01.492 --> 17:04.738
promote the full professor and department head.

17:04.898 --> 17:08.163
Describe the department when you took over.

17:08.183 --> 17:19.703
Well, when I began my activities in the department, we had Dr. Burns was head, Dr. Davis was in it, and myself.

17:19.683 --> 17:42.096
and Dr. McMurray had moved to the dean's office and so I taught all the physiology and Dr. Davis taught all, Richard Davis taught all the pharmacology and then Dr. Burns taught toxicology and then Dr. Davis and I, I saw a need to begin a graduate program

17:42.852 --> 17:51.821
And so we began teaching graduate courses, and Dr. Davis and I taught all the graduate courses.

17:53.243 --> 18:01.811
And our senior architect, I became department head, I saw that the College of Veterinary Medicine had no advanced degree program.

18:02.892 --> 18:12.302
And so I approached the coordinating board with a request for a PhD program in physiology and a PhD program in toxicology.

18:13.480 --> 18:17.826
And there's lots, it takes lots of effort to put in for a Ph.D.

18:17.846 --> 18:24.995
program when you're competing with all of the colleges and universities and state.

18:25.996 --> 18:28.960
And they don't like to see other programs arise.

18:28.980 --> 18:35.068
So my first request for a program in physiology was turned down, according to board.

18:35.910 --> 18:38.693
And I said, you're not very smart.

18:40.395 --> 18:43.099
Why did I ask for a degree in physiology?

18:43.417 --> 18:50.104
And so I went back and prepared a degree in veterinary, Ph.D.

18:50.124 --> 18:52.046
in veterinary physiology.

18:52.847 --> 18:58.393
Went to coordinating board, and there wasn't any way they could turn it down because there wasn't any other veterinary school.

18:59.374 --> 19:02.517
And so I got approval for a degree in veterinary, Ph.D.

19:02.577 --> 19:11.567
in veterinary physiology, and then I went forward soon after for a degree in veterinary toxicology, Ph.D.,

19:11.851 --> 19:14.935
Were those the first doctoral programs, PhD programs in the college?

19:15.015 --> 19:15.797
In the college.

19:17.038 --> 19:25.670
And then began to teach courses and to bring faculty.

19:26.872 --> 19:33.201
And we began, and we already taught a service course in physiology for a

19:33.653 --> 19:40.208
the College of Agriculture, which was a big course load.

19:40.469 --> 19:45.300
And then we began to teach 601, 602 physiology.

19:46.546 --> 19:58.559
and for other students on campus, and it became huge graduate courses of 30 and 40 kids per semester.

19:59.220 --> 20:01.803
We began teaching Brooks Air Force Base students.

20:02.744 --> 20:13.296
We began teaching, then expanding our graduate program to include courses in

20:13.816 --> 20:23.670
cardiovascular physiology and respiratory physiology and endocrinology, pharmacology, toxicology.

20:23.690 --> 20:29.297
And so we built a rather large graduate program.

20:30.820 --> 20:36.988
In fact, at one time we had 70 graduate students enrolled in our little department.

20:37.711 --> 20:55.112
Our department had begun to grow because based on student credit hours, et cetera, service courses we were teaching, the number of graduate courses we were teaching, I was able to acquire additional faculty.

20:56.273 --> 21:00.620
Who were some of the key faculty you brought in?

21:00.640 --> 21:05.567
Oh, I brought in untold key faculty.

21:06.949 --> 21:20.830
I guess the three that stick in all the students' minds were Dr. Don Clark and Dr. Jim Anderson, Dr. Larry Claiborne, Dr. Sabunowich,

21:21.333 --> 21:30.313
Dr. Bill Jenkins, Dr. Benny Camp, Dr. J.W.

21:31.137 --> 21:54.160
Dr. Stephen Safe, Dr. Merle Bailey, Dr. Amos, Dr. Hightower, Dr. Oh, let me see.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.862
There were so many.

21:56.230 --> 22:02.602
All right, numerically, when you became department head, the faculty was how many?

22:02.682 --> 22:03.023
Three.

22:03.544 --> 22:05.508
And when you retired?

22:05.929 --> 22:06.189
Left 30.

22:06.209 --> 22:10.257
30, and that's how many years?

22:10.658 --> 22:14.566
Oh, I was department head for about 20 years, I guess.

22:14.586 --> 22:18.434
68 to, you became department head in 68?

22:18.474 --> 22:23.264
Yeah, about then, 68, to about 88.

22:23.805 --> 22:26.491
Where did you recruit these faculty?

22:26.531 --> 22:26.852
Everywhere?

22:27.232 --> 22:31.401
Yes, I went, what I did, I went to,

22:31.938 --> 22:44.419
three major scientific meetings every year with the intent of locating potential faculty.

22:44.439 --> 22:54.396
I went to the Federated Society meeting, which is the largest meeting of biologists every year, about 10,000 or so.

22:54.697 --> 22:55.498
I went to the

22:56.103 --> 23:25.350
AVMA meeting every year, and I went to the, in Chicago every year I went to the Animal Research Workers Conference, and they always had at that, they had lots of graduate students presenting papers, and so I would go and rotate and find potential

23:25.837 --> 23:30.582
graduate students or people that I thought were outstanding.

23:31.383 --> 23:39.352
So I would start recruiting them early before they ever finished their PhD or lots of them.

23:40.333 --> 23:43.277
And then I went for people that were different.

23:43.497 --> 23:47.862
I remember I hired Dr. John Hunter and he had a

23:49.107 --> 24:05.148
a degree in electrical engineering from Northwestern University, and a MS degree from Iowa State University in biomedical engineering, and then a PhD, or DVM from Purdue.

24:06.349 --> 24:16.262
And he was a computer specialist that started the PLATO system, which was the first teaching system in the computer teaching system.

24:16.495 --> 24:39.178
Anyhow, I would find these young people and nurture them, and we finally ended up, I guess, with the most diverse and probably the best veterinary physiology, pharmacology, toxicology department in the country.

24:39.158 --> 24:48.240
Of course, one of the real keys I brought in from South Africa was Bill Jenkins, who's now chancellor at LSU.

24:48.946 --> 24:55.312
And what I did, I kept a professorship open every year and brought in visiting.

24:55.913 --> 25:00.037
I would go worldwide to find a visiting professor to bring in each year.

25:01.058 --> 25:05.202
Jenkins was one I brought in on that program.

25:06.484 --> 25:14.852
But all that, recruiting probably, and with the help of Dr.

25:15.372 --> 25:25.627
because I had to take them all to his office, and he always had a good song and dance for them.

25:25.707 --> 25:39.186
Higher administration helped when you're trying to recruit people to see that there's an interest all the way up through the system in faculty.

25:39.166 --> 25:43.049
Let's also review.

25:43.770 --> 25:50.035
When you became department head, did Dr. Price give you any advice or counsel about heading a department?

25:51.477 --> 25:54.840
None whatsoever.

25:54.960 --> 26:00.384
Everybody figured, you know, you either made it or you didn't make it, I guess.

26:00.505 --> 26:09.072
As a young department head, I had to fall into executive committee, which met every week with

26:09.052 --> 26:14.561
with all of the original founders that I talked about.

26:14.661 --> 26:19.809
I always sat at the end of the table at these meetings.

26:20.971 --> 26:22.413
Because you were the junior member?

26:22.433 --> 26:25.778
I was a junior member and I just kind of stayed back in a way.

26:26.365 --> 26:39.902
But what they could never understand is that during these executive committee meetings, I got more work done while I was sitting there writing proposals and reports and doing other things.

26:40.439 --> 26:55.207
had a secretary of that group, and he told the dean one time, he said, Dr. McCready doesn't do anything during the meeting except write, and he doesn't pay any attention, and this and that and other.

26:55.227 --> 26:59.916
And his colleagues, interesting because

26:59.896 --> 27:16.099
I had a fellow department head write a letter to the dean one time, and he described me as being a piece of like Bermuda grass.

27:17.521 --> 27:22.789
I got my tentacles into everything and all the money.

27:24.492 --> 27:28.317
I did have many, many buildings.

27:28.297 --> 27:32.521
and other things and resources.

27:34.423 --> 27:35.564
I was just fortunate.

27:35.704 --> 27:39.728
How would you describe your working relationship with Dean Price?

27:40.289 --> 27:41.029
Oh, very good.

27:41.350 --> 27:43.712
All the deans.

27:43.732 --> 27:45.534
I never bothered them.

27:46.715 --> 27:53.021
And when you became department head, did he have an associate dean at that time?

27:53.582 --> 27:55.063
No, he had an assistant.

27:55.634 --> 28:10.197
Dr. McMurray, when I was hired, then that gave Dr. McMurray a chance to go down and be the assistant to the dean, and he interviewed all the students and took care of student affairs and so forth.

28:10.217 --> 28:14.805
Who was the dean's key clerical staff person?

28:16.668 --> 28:23.278
Well, when I first came into the college, there was a lady, Mrs. Johnson, and then

28:24.642 --> 28:34.378
Later on, I guess Amadelle Bacchus was the key individual all the way through Dr. Price's tenure.

28:34.398 --> 28:35.179
Is she still living?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.623
She's still living, doing very well.

28:38.104 --> 28:39.046
Is she interviewable?

28:39.587 --> 28:39.867
Yeah.

28:41.534 --> 28:48.641
Yeah, she's, she's... B-A-C-K-U-S?

28:48.661 --> 28:50.162
B-A-C-H-U-S.

28:50.603 --> 28:52.645
B-A-C-H-U-S.

28:53.205 --> 29:02.614
And then... Amadell, and she's, she's in local directory, and she's, I see her every week at church.

29:03.174 --> 29:09.060
What, what did, what were her, describe her function in the dean's office?

29:10.981 --> 29:37.018
Oh, I guess as any good administrative secretary, she tried to reduce the workload on the dean by filtration, I guess, of the, and prioritizing the items and people that came to the office.

29:37.038 --> 29:38.440
What kind of personality did she have?

29:39.078 --> 29:43.224
Oh, Pleasant, all business.

29:45.007 --> 29:46.910
Now, Libby Goss, did she?

29:48.031 --> 29:50.796
Libby was a later addition.

29:52.618 --> 29:54.822
She worked kind of for Iberdale.

29:54.962 --> 29:59.128
And then there was a Mary Ned Bellick.

29:59.800 --> 30:06.555
that became Dr. Price's secretary, I mean Dr. McMurray's secretary, and they handled all the student affairs.

30:09.722 --> 30:15.615
During, what was your routine on a daily basis while you were department heading?

30:16.574 --> 30:34.144
Well, when I was department head, I tried to come to the department early every morning, and then, of course, I still had all my teaching load, and I was trying to build a research program and trying to get a nice little institute of health

30:34.732 --> 30:42.347
Grant and trying to with Baylor and trying and I moved to Grant from Baylor when I came on pulmonary hypertension.

30:42.728 --> 30:55.272
So I had a research project going and I had teaching going and departmental administration and building buildings and programs and PhD programs and

30:55.252 --> 31:04.953
But I made it, even when the faculty grew as it did, I tried to make a part, and I began to expand.

31:05.113 --> 31:14.593
I had faculty in five different buildings at one time, and so I tried to

31:16.362 --> 31:28.853
If at all possible, I tried to get into those buildings nearly every day, but at least once a week so that I was all, not to oversee or anything, just to,
