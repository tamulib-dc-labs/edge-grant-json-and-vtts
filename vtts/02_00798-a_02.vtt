WEBVTT

00:01.077 --> 00:08.866
But there's no way of explaining the Aggie spirit 
that I know of. You have to. I know when I went home at

00:10.327 --> 00:18.116
Christmas, and I just laughingly told them about 
the hazing, some of it. I didn't tell them all of it.

00:21.860 --> 00:26.005
They didn't want me to go back to A&M, these people I 
had been working for. That was home to me from then

00:26.025 --> 00:29.008
on. No, they wanted me to go to University of Texas. 
But no way was I going to the SIPP school by then,

00:32.926 --> 00:41.980
because I had been indoctrinated at A&M. I was an 
Aggie. And just like this little fella here, he

00:46.427 --> 00:53.538
became an MD, and he's still practicing in Mount 
Pleasant, Texas. Little William Taylor, yeah.

00:59.532 --> 01:00.733
The others are dead. Nice little bill. So did you 
first come in 1920? 1924. Fall of 1924. Okay. And

01:16.750 --> 01:19.633
then you received your degree in 1931, didn't you? 
1931. Well, I changed over to biology, as I said.

01:26.941 --> 01:28.543
And then I took pre-med. And in 1927, I went to 
Galveston Medical School. Oh, you did? I was there

01:35.514 --> 01:36.555
a year. And in the first month of June, I was at home. 
I broke down with tuberculosis. In fact, I had had

01:45.246 --> 01:47.829
TB here at A&M. I know because I had a pulmonary 
hemorrhage one night there in the dormitory. and

01:57.447 --> 02:00.010
went over to the college hospital. This is an 
indictment of our college hospital as it was. And

02:05.378 --> 02:11.246
old Arsocks, who was the head nurse, didn't want to 
let me in because it was after hours. They closed it

02:11.967 --> 02:13.669
at 9 o'clock. No matter if you had tuberculosis or 
not. I was spitting out blood. Really? I was having

02:21.239 --> 02:23.843
a pulmonary hemorrhage. And I had pleurisy so 
badly that I could hardly breathe. So she finally

02:30.287 --> 02:33.752
let me in and gave me a bed. The next morning, the 
doctor had me get up and come around to his office

02:34.573 --> 02:42.263
instead of coming to my bed. Of course, I didn't 
know what was wrong with me at that time. But he

02:48.471 --> 02:53.458
examined me and said there was a little place up in 
my nasal cavity that was raw and was bleeding and it

02:53.894 --> 02:59.340
was running down in my throat and I was spitting it 
up. I said, well I don't know about that because I

03:01.782 --> 03:14.977
had my head over like this between my knees almost 
and I spat blood out on the piece of paper that I had

03:01.782 --> 03:14.977
on the floor. No blood came out of my nose with my 
head in that position. Oh, he says, well, that's

03:22.936 --> 03:24.517
what it is. And so I said, well, what about this 
pleurisy? I can hardly breathe. He says, oh, well,

03:28.581 --> 03:31.564
if it gets too bad, come back and I'll strap you 
down. So I went ahead. He wouldn't even give me a

03:35.087 --> 03:46.357
military to get me out of revelry, exercises, or 
cavalry, drill, or anything, saber charges, or

03:35.087 --> 03:46.357
anything else. So I streaked along for several 
weeks, just a little blood, But I finally got over

03:52.990 --> 03:55.872
it. I don't know how. And that came up in later 
years. There was a committee investigating the

03:59.856 --> 04:03.018
college hospital. This was during Mr. 
Gilchrist's time as president. And so they had a

04:07.882 --> 04:12.987
committee over from Scott and White to examine the 
college hospital. And of course, they found it A1

04:13.667 --> 04:22.795
because Dr. Marsh, who was the resident 
physician, had interned at Scott and White. Sure.

04:24.566 --> 04:25.247
So nothing. And I had a friend who was externing 
that year. He was a medical student in Galveston.

04:30.614 --> 04:37.043
He was externing as an extern in the college 
hospital. And they didn't allow him to come back to

04:37.063 --> 04:40.487
the hospital that day. And just only the licensed 
nurse was there. And the others, they kept away.

04:46.636 --> 05:00.108
Anyhow, I don't know whether you want to put that in 
there or not, but anyhow, they had me up and I

04:46.636 --> 05:00.108
reported to this committee and all that sort of 
thing, and they had the investigation and

04:46.636 --> 05:00.108
whitewashed the whole thing. Well, I went to 
Galveston Medical School in September following

05:01.129 --> 05:06.374
that. And what do you think happened? You got TB. I 
never did recover. Really? I never did recover. I

05:15.778 --> 05:23.026
knew there was something wrong with me during the 
whole year, but then when June came around, I broke

05:15.778 --> 05:23.026
down again. And that time, I went out to 
Sanatorium, Texas, was admitted out there, and I

05:24.427 --> 05:32.115
spent five months out there. Got an arrested case. 
Oh, good. And by that time, I was out of money,

05:35.458 --> 05:39.542
strapped. We had, my father had sold the lower 
farm, and I did get my mother's part. There were

05:46.677 --> 05:49.361
five children for that to be divided among. I got my 
part from my mother's interest in the place. And I

05:54.608 --> 06:00.315
had that to go on, but that wasn't enough to take me 
back to medical school. But that year, I came back

06:01.236 --> 06:06.103
to A&M.

06:07.012 --> 06:14.985
I was sitting there on the corner of Old Gathright, 
the porch on Old Gathright Hall, which has been

06:07.012 --> 06:14.985
torn down many years ago. After I'd registered, I 
wondered what I was going to do. Who wants to room

06:20.654 --> 06:26.063
with someone who's had tuberculosis? Well, I just 
happened to look up about that time, and here came

06:26.083 --> 06:31.872
an old boy down Military Walk. He and I had been at 
sanatorium together. Oh, really? Yeah. And so I

06:37.429 --> 06:40.172
said, hey, come here. What are you doing? He said, I 
just registered. I'm going to A&M. I said, well,

06:44.456 --> 06:46.037
where are you going to live? He said, I don't know 
yet. I'll have to find a place. I said, well, wait a

06:49.881 --> 06:51.823
minute. We'll find a place together. Two old 
lungers. So we found a place in Bryant. So in other

07:00.995 --> 07:04.219
words, you didn't live on campus. No, I didn't. I 
couldn't have gone in the dormitory because there

07:06.521 --> 07:12.629
was no place for them. It was all military. In other 
words, you didn't have to be in the military, no?

07:18.956 --> 07:22.660
Once you were initiated past the fish, you didn't 
have to? Yeah, you had to in those days. Everybody

07:25.023 --> 07:26.545
had to be in the military. They were all in the 
military. So you lived off campus and then

07:31.083 --> 07:36.129
everybody still nevertheless wore that poor 
uniform. Well, he and I didn't because we were just

07:36.149 --> 07:43.357
classified as day students then. But if you lived 
in the dormitory, you were in the military and you

07:44.558 --> 07:51.966
wore the uniform and so on. When I first went to A&M, 
everybody wore the uniform whether they were

07:51.986 --> 07:58.373
crippled or not. Casual, they lived around over 
there in either Alpha or Beta Hall, those old halls

07:58.724 --> 08:08.459
that were down there where Walton Hall is now. 
There were two old southern homes with the big

08:08.479 --> 08:13.426
columns in front and so on. That's where the 
cosmopolites lived, the foreign students and all

08:13.446 --> 08:19.655
the cripples and what have you. They called them 
gold breakers and sons of rest and all that sort of

08:20.156 --> 08:24.863
thing. Anyhow. He and I roomed together, and I went 
to A&M. And that was in 1929. And 1930,

08:35.157 --> 08:40.705
he and I were still together. We got us a room over at 
Bryan Nursery and Floral Company, fired the

08:41.266 --> 08:55.208
boiler, and stemmed flowers, and helped around 
the place for our room, and boarded next door.

08:55.863 --> 09:05.293
1931, while we lived on the back porch at his 
mother's home on Texas Avenue in Bryan. Just the

09:05.333 --> 09:08.075
other side of where that hat company is now. Old 
two-story house. Why did you decide to go to

09:12.119 --> 09:16.384
veterinary school? Well, back about 1930, I began 
taking elective courses in veterinary medicine.

09:26.423 --> 09:36.920
Because you could get bacteriology and 
physiology and some good courses over there at

09:26.423 --> 09:36.920
that time in those areas. And they would allow you 
to pick up electives in veterinary medicine.

09:43.871 --> 09:47.877
Because in 1930, they had only one student 
graduate.

09:50.581 --> 09:54.287
The beginning of the Great Depression.

09:56.073 --> 10:00.559
They were very happy to have people come over so 
they could keep their courses open. So 1931, I got

10:03.203 --> 10:10.113
my degree in biology. And I began work on a master's 
degree in biology. In 1932, I picked up my first

10:14.839 --> 10:23.852
fellowship, $45 a month.

10:26.110 --> 10:31.675
I didn't know if Dr. Ball, who was head of the 
biology department, had mapped out my work for two

10:26.110 --> 10:31.675
years.

10:34.978 --> 10:37.741
And he thought I would have the fellowship both 
years. Well, in 1932, it worked nicely. I had the

10:43.266 --> 10:45.548
fellowship, $45 a month. And I was still doing all 
my cooking and washing and ironing and everything

10:46.669 --> 10:54.396
myself.

10:58.730 --> 11:03.096
time came in 1932 for me to come back to school. It 
was in the fall of 32. And Dr. Ball found out that I

11:09.464 --> 11:16.693
couldn't have the fellowship two years in 
succession. It was in the fall of 33. I couldn't

11:18.596 --> 11:24.223
have this fellowship two years in succession. Dr. 
Morgan, who was dean of the graduate school, said

11:24.303 --> 11:27.387
they only had eight fellowships at A&M, and they 
had to pass them around. So I didn't find that out

11:33.581 --> 11:39.406
until it was too late for me to do anything else 
about it. I didn't have money enough to come back to

11:39.466 --> 11:42.369
school. I worked for the Texas Highway Department 
that year. Oh, you did. $3 and a half a day. And the

11:48.796 --> 11:53.340
little course that I had in plane surveying came in 
handy. Because I knew how to set up the transit, the

11:54.603 --> 11:57.868
levels, and so on. I knew what they were doing with 
points on the tangent and all that business. I knew

12:01.913 --> 12:02.975
what they were doing. And rainy days, I worked in 
the office running a planimeter, figuring out

12:04.317 --> 12:16.314
cross sections and the amount of dirt removed and 
so on, what to pay the contractor and what not. So it

12:17.115 --> 12:18.858
worked out very nicely. I saved my money. The 
following year, then I came back to A&M. I picked up

12:22.691 --> 12:27.837
that fellowship again at $45 a month.

12:31.461 --> 12:33.884
But nevertheless, that was still in biology, 
right? Still in biology. This was in

12:35.806 --> 12:37.408
bacteriology. Well, why'd you decide to go into 
veterinary medicine then? Well, I graduated. I

12:43.215 --> 12:46.699
got my master's degree in 34 in biology. I had about 
half of the course in veterinary medicine worked

12:47.422 --> 12:54.833
off as electives. I see. So it was a toss-up whether 
to go for a PhD in bacteriology or should I go ahead

12:55.434 --> 13:03.606
and finish veterinary medicine. I see. Well, PhD 
in bacteriology, a dime a dozen. Oh, they were in

13:10.256 --> 13:13.421
the Depression. Mm-hmm. Veterinary medicine, to 
me, was the better of the better choice. And that's

13:18.493 --> 13:20.315
what I took. So I picked up a fellowship then in 
pathology. One of these. Another $450 deal. I was

13:27.902 --> 13:37.872
still living off the campus and still doing all of 
my cooking and washing and ironing and what have

13:27.902 --> 13:37.872
you. And still with this same old boy, you and I. And 
Brian. So I had that fellowship two years. And that

13:48.659 --> 13:50.842
took me on through then. And I graduated in 
veterinary medicine in August of 36. And Dr.

13:56.328 --> 14:01.254
Marsteller hired me as an instructor for 
September of 36.

14:04.538 --> 14:09.184
And I began teaching then as an instructor in 
pathology.

14:11.105 --> 14:18.355
Summers of 37 and the summers of 38, Ruth and I took 
out, went to Michigan, University of Michigan.

14:18.555 --> 14:18.875
Really? Took their pathology in medical school. 
They would admit a veterinarian. You had to have a

14:25.063 --> 14:33.394
doctor's degree in the medical sciences, either 
an MD or a DVM or a DDS. So they would admit you. Well,

14:34.856 --> 14:39.863
could you compare the level of instruction with 
the University of Michigan with... with Texas A&M

14:40.332 --> 14:42.756
about at that time? You'd have to go back and look at 
veterinary school at Texas A&M. It was created or

14:49.165 --> 14:53.792
established in 1916, I believe it was. And to begin 
with, they were very well equipped and staffed.

15:02.825 --> 15:06.190
But with one graduate in 1930, I don't know. The 
thing had gone down, and when I got into pathology

15:08.969 --> 15:18.102
in 1936, to be truthful, it had gone to nothing. It 
was a bunch of junk. Why is that? All the equipment

15:22.588 --> 15:26.674
had just gone to pot. 20 years old. Rusted out, 
obsolete, what have you, torn up junk. And that was

15:33.945 --> 15:35.567
it. So when I began in pathology, we had no slide 
collection. We had some gross specimens of old

15:43.378 --> 15:48.664
lesions, tumors, and what have you. But they 
hadn't been taken care of. The fluid had been

15:52.469 --> 15:58.396
allowed to evaporate and the specimen dry out and 
what have you. So there I was. I was to teach general

16:00.839 --> 16:04.283
pathology and special pathology. I didn't have a 
thing. not a slide. If you wanted to show a section

16:09.543 --> 16:20.317
of acute inflammation, you didn't have a section 
of showing an acute inflammation. You didn't have

16:20.337 --> 16:21.459
anything. You had to talk about it and draw 
pictures on the board. That's about the only way.

16:28.128 --> 16:35.798
Well, in pathology, I had to do all of the autopsy 
work in the College of Veterinary Medicine.

16:35.818 --> 16:37.380
Everything that came into the to the post-mortem 
room was subject to my investigation. I had to do

16:45.547 --> 16:51.193
the post on it and report on it to Dr. Marsteller or 
to the clinicians. I saved all of the specimens. I

16:56.479 --> 16:58.602
got material for sectioning.

17:02.026 --> 17:04.048
I did all of that work myself. I was the only one in 
pathology. I had no technical help. I did all of the

17:10.547 --> 17:13.912
sectioning and staining and so on. I did all of the 
post-mortem work. I took all the gross specimens.

17:18.159 --> 17:24.508
I put them in museum jars on Saturdays and Sundays 
and so on, and nights. And maybe you have a class in

17:24.528 --> 17:33.642
general pathology, and perhaps you're taking up 
the pneumonias. You just had an old cow or some

17:33.892 --> 17:38.759
animal that died and she had pneumonia. I don't 
know. Maybe what kind you have to determine. So

17:42.966 --> 17:44.448
you've sectioned the tissue. You've made a class 
set. And you run down to class with this couple of

17:46.051 --> 17:54.684
trays of slides with the balsam still fresh and the 
cover slips almost floating. Tell them to be very

17:55.125 --> 17:57.688
careful with these slides. I've just made them. So 
we studied whatever that was. Well, our students

18:03.592 --> 18:12.762
had very little background in normal microscopic 
structure of tissues, histology. Had very little

18:14.364 --> 18:18.589
training, because that was in the Department of 
Anatomy. And evidently, they had nothing there

18:19.710 --> 18:22.053
either. No slides. Maybe they, well, Dr. Mundink 
came that year. Well, he didn't come until, Well,

18:31.958 --> 18:33.621
it was in the late 30s. But anyway, he tried to make 
some slides. But they were overstained, burnt up,

18:37.406 --> 18:41.593
not very good. But anyway, I had to make up 
histology sections as well, normal tissues, as

18:41.613 --> 18:49.425
well as the abnormal. And I had to teach them the 
normal first and then show them the

18:49.866 --> 18:55.374
abnormalities.

18:57.457 --> 19:00.582
So that's the way the pathology went. I

19:01.507 --> 19:09.475
think that's the only way to teach histology, 
actually. In other words, during the middle

19:09.896 --> 19:17.724
1930s, you had a real dearth of supplies at the 
school. Do you know what my budget was? No. $500 a

19:20.547 --> 19:22.149
year. Really? That's all? And I was the only staff 
member in pathology. I had no technical help

19:30.582 --> 19:33.345
whatsoever. And that technical help thing went on 
for 15 years. It wasn't until in the 1950s that I got

19:37.951 --> 19:41.915
technical help. Up to that time, I did everything 
myself. Well, is that what the main difference

19:46.541 --> 19:50.926
between there and the University of Michigan? Did 
they have money? They had the money. Because they

19:54.250 --> 19:57.534
didn't have the money that Michigan State had. 
Right. Because Michigan State was like

19:58.797 --> 20:01.481
University of Texas. They were in the capital 
city. They got the money. And the University of

20:04.906 --> 20:07.190
Michigan was like A&M. We got the hind tit. That was 
it. And so that's the way poor old A&M was. We didn't

20:15.602 --> 20:17.385
have anything to work with. And back in those days, 
we had in the administration what I've always

20:17.405 --> 20:26.138
termed the button shoe boys. Can you explain that 
one? I think I'm going to like it. Well, the Button

20:33.972 --> 20:37.135
Shoe Boys were from the old school. And you were 
judged as an administrator by the way you carried

20:38.597 --> 20:50.510
on your appropriation, your budget, and you 
turned money back at the end of the year. Oh,

20:50.991 --> 20:51.531
really? Yeah. You could do with what they dished 
out to you and then turn a little back That was about

20:58.670 --> 21:03.435
the way it was, or the way I thought it was, anyhow. 
We didn't have anything to work with, and if you got

21:03.455 --> 21:09.322
anything, you almost had to fight somebody for it. 
And as far as equipment went, in pathology, it was

21:09.863 --> 21:19.714
the same way in anatomy when I went there. Dr. 
Francis had bought five little old high school

21:19.734 --> 21:24.439
microscopes. I think he paid $35 a piece for them. 
And that's all we had in the way of microscopes. And

21:32.369 --> 21:40.341
you had to beg, borrow, and steal from other 
departments microscopes enough for the group,

21:32.369 --> 21:40.341
for the class.

21:43.306 --> 21:50.396
Tables, kitchen tables, just plain old kitchen 
tables.

21:50.416 --> 21:56.105
Chairs, old cane bottom chairs that you got out of 
the basement. They'd been thrown away.

22:00.196 --> 22:07.145
We had no air conditioning in the summer classes or 
in the spring or the hot days in the fall. All the

22:07.846 --> 22:09.208
windows were open. We had all male in the class, no 
females. I said, just take your shirts off and

22:13.934 --> 22:17.438
strip down to the waist. Really? Right in class? In 
class. It was too hot. And even at that, you're

22:23.905 --> 22:30.210
trying to do microscopic work, and the 
perspiration is dripping off your elbow. You're

22:30.311 --> 22:31.492
sitting there. How can you work in that condition? 
It's like being in a boiler room. It'd be better out

22:36.696 --> 22:38.778
there in the shade of a tree.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.363
And that's the way it was at Texas A&M. Well, when 
did they get electricity for electric fans and

22:44.383 --> 22:47.706
things like that? Well, they had the electricity 
then. But they didn't have the money for the fans?

22:51.269 --> 22:53.811
They sure didn't have a fan. Only the president had 
a fan in his office. That's the same way when I was

22:57.911 --> 23:05.460
yelling my head off for air conditioning when we 
were putting up the new veterinary hospital out

22:57.911 --> 23:05.460
over there. And Reese Spence was sitting there 
with us, going over the plans. And I said, well, are

23:11.387 --> 23:16.513
we going to have air conditioning in this new 
setup? Oh, he hit the ceiling. Why, even Mr.

23:20.740 --> 23:25.125
Gilchrist's office isn't air conditioned. I 
never had air conditioning when I was at Purdue.

23:31.551 --> 23:34.775
So they didn't air condition. I said, well, Mr. 
Spence, if you were in business in Bryan, Texas,

23:34.795 --> 23:49.971
say you were in a haberdashery, and here's another 
haberdashery right next to you, and he's air

23:34.795 --> 23:49.971
conditioned, who would get to business if you were 
not air conditioned? I said, that guy'd get all the

23:50.204 --> 23:54.270
business and he'd run you out. And I said, it's the 
same way right now. Sam Houston University over

23:55.732 --> 23:58.897
there. When was this? This is in the 50s when they 
were building that? Yeah, this was in the 50s. So

24:03.564 --> 24:08.211
they have air conditioning over there in their 
dormitories in the summertime. And our students

24:08.872 --> 24:11.876
are going to Sam Houston in the summertime. Sure, I 
don't blame them. Not over here in these dives that

24:15.642 --> 24:19.367
we roast them. Come

24:19.499 --> 24:26.726
out parboiled.

24:26.746 --> 24:31.851
But you know, they did not air condition that new 
set up. And it wasn't until several years later

24:31.871 --> 24:40.980
that they went in there and then they found out that 
the duct system was too small to accommodate air

24:31.871 --> 24:40.980
conditioning. They have to tear out all the ducts 
and punch the buildings all full of holes and

24:41.300 --> 24:48.527
enlarge their Addicts and so on for ducks and what 
have you. Then we got, for several hundred

24:53.177 --> 24:58.542
thousand dollars more, we got air conditioning.

25:01.084 --> 25:08.170
Even though over there in that new setup, I had a 
great big room for histology. I was in anatomy

25:08.390 --> 25:09.532
then. This was to be air conditioned. No windows. 
And only one door into the hallway. This was to be a

25:18.612 --> 25:26.384
dark room laboratory, because I used a projector 
and projected the slides on the screen for them to

25:18.612 --> 25:26.384
study. This was one from their set, see? So that 
when they began to study it, they had already been

25:29.148 --> 25:33.775
over it with me. And they knew where to look for what 
and where. So we finally got two great big old

25:37.721 --> 25:44.552
three-foot fans. and set them at different places 
in the room so it'd stir up the air and blow you out of

25:45.376 --> 25:54.247
your wig off. But anyhow, they finally put me a 
five-ton unit in the ceiling in the back of that

25:55.268 --> 26:01.737
room. That was before the remainder of the 
building was air-conditioned. I raised so much

26:06.983 --> 26:08.585
chain about it. And then you'd almost freeze them 
out. Right, right. trying to get that thing

26:14.603 --> 26:18.308
regulated in any way. Let's go back for a minute to 
when you were a student in the vet school. Who were

26:23.774 --> 26:25.176
your favorite instructors? Well, my favorite 
instructors were Dr. Burns in physiology. Dr.

26:33.206 --> 26:35.869
Burns was always very thorough. He was tough as a 
boot. Oh, he was. But he was thorough. What kind of

26:43.361 --> 26:48.646
person was he besides just being tough? Well, he 
was approachable

26:48.666 --> 26:54.672
because he was an Aggie. Burns was an Aggie and I 
think he sort of acted like a senior among

26:55.913 --> 27:06.463
underclassmen. He had that discipline.

27:11.021 --> 27:16.648
It's just like our Army officers, the old Aggie 
Army officers. They had that discipline.

27:21.435 --> 27:25.901
They carried themselves well, and they proved it 
in World War II. Dr. Leonard. Dr. Leonard was

27:27.783 --> 27:33.211
another, and Dr. Dunn, the old boy I worked for in 
pathology.

27:35.434 --> 27:36.315
Those fellas.

27:40.345 --> 27:41.566
Did you have Mark Francis? I had Mark Francis. 
Yeah, he was a favorite. But I just had him in

27:45.251 --> 27:48.014
anatomy. What kind of teacher was he? He was very 
good. Dr. Francis was deaf as a post. He couldn't

27:55.543 --> 27:59.207
hear himself talk. I've heard that from others, 
too. He was a comical person. I heard. And that

28:03.272 --> 28:05.575
meant that he talked more than anybody else. Is 
that true? Yeah. He had a good sense of humor? He had

28:11.437 --> 28:13.220
a very good sense of humor. I remember one time in 
anatomy, he was embalming, trying to get an old

28:13.240 --> 28:22.593
mule down so he could embalm him. And he had wet the 
floor so he could throw this old mule. He got the

28:28.923 --> 28:32.588
floor real slippery and this old mule couldn't 
stand up on it. It falls by himself. He wasn't shot.

28:39.762 --> 28:43.367
Dr. Francis had on some rubber boots. And these 
rubber boots were pretty slick on the bottom. And

28:46.231 --> 28:47.973
his feet went out from under him. And he hit the 
ground, hit that concrete floor, kabam. But he

28:52.239 --> 28:53.741
jumped up right away. Of course, we all ran over to 
him to pick him up. But he got up before we got there.

28:59.730 --> 29:01.312
There's a little lesson in that. So whenever you 
want to throw an old mule, you just wet the floor.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.763
That's the way Dr. Francis was. I went in his office 
one day. He had just given an examination. He had a

29:19.827 --> 29:22.149
pile of papers there on his desk. I said, Dr. 
Francis, when are you going to grade our papers?

29:27.073 --> 29:28.475
Well, he said, I'll tell you. And he picked up those 
papers and he put them in one of the drawers of his

29:29.476 --> 29:37.843
desk and threw an old iron horseshoe in there on top 
of them. And then he stomped on it with his foot a

29:37.863 --> 29:41.106
couple of times Slammed the drawer. Said, if 
you'll notice, in the college regulations,

29:44.351 --> 29:53.485
they say that you must give examinations. But they 
don't say one word about ever grading them. And he

29:59.213 --> 30:01.056
just grinned and looked at me. And he never did 
grade them. Really? He says, you know, I never did

30:04.921 --> 30:08.687
flunk but one boy. And I learned my lesson. Said, 
you know that fool is a millionaire today?

30:21.533 --> 30:23.555
I guess he should have flunked more of them, boy. I 
would have been a millionaire. Maybe he should

30:25.218 --> 30:29.984
have flunked you. I never had any trouble with old 
Mark. He was a good old boy. He had a wonderful

30:36.212 --> 30:38.194
collection there. It was built into a museum. He 
and Dr. Ball. Dr. Ball spent many years of his life

30:43.812 --> 30:56.224
in getting fossil remains of fern leaves and such 
out of the old clay banks on the Brazos River and

30:43.812 --> 30:56.224
what have you. And he spent innumerable hours 
working on those babies and getting them. And the

31:04.673 --> 31:09.598
old biology building, torn down many years ago, 
The upstairs hallway ran the whole length of the

31:11.198 --> 31:15.385
building, almost. And both sides of the hall, 
cases, glass top cases with all these

31:16.527 --> 31:26.744
archaeological specimens that he had worked out 
in. He had them all labeled and everything.
