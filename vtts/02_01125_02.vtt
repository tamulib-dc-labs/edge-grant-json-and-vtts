WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:31.624
know I would not

00:02.630 --> 00:31.624
have done anything

00:02.630 --> 00:31.624
basically different from what you have seen in 
other parts of the world and country and so forth uh

00:02.630 --> 00:31.624
what is it that makes the I assume you feel that the 
Woodlands is a rather distinctive uh community

00:02.630 --> 00:31.624
enterprise what is it that is in your mind very 
distinctive or unique or special about the

00:02.630 --> 00:31.624
Woodlands I I would think that used to be a 
preservation of the natural environment that we

00:32.178 --> 00:37.886
all have tuned in very, very well. I mean, everyone 
from the secretaries all the way to the personnel

00:38.727 --> 00:50.565
in the field, to the designer, to the engineer, to 
surveyor, everybody's tuned in in preserving the

00:38.727 --> 00:50.565
natural environment. I think that's what sets us 
apart. Has that been a cost-efficient kind of

00:52.648 --> 00:57.354
thing, that effort? On the overall picture, 
absolutely. Yes, sir. It might be... It might have

01:02.671 --> 01:11.521
been more economical to put a bulldozer over here 
and cut down all the trees and start building

01:02.671 --> 01:11.521
houses. However, by the time you start planting 
the trees back and reforest the land back, it's

01:12.142 --> 01:18.949
going to cost you more. So the way it has been done 
for a long time, and on the overall cost

01:19.309 --> 01:27.919
effectiveness, it is the best way we're doing it. 
Because you can never, never be able to duplicate

01:28.237 --> 01:35.745
the natural environment, no matter how hard you 
try. And I understand that that design has also

01:35.765 --> 01:46.978
contributed to making your utility systems, your 
fluids, your water supply systems, drainage, and

01:35.765 --> 01:46.978
all that much more cost efficient. Is that right? 
Or not? Well, that's a reasonable thought. It can

01:55.625 --> 01:56.886
go both ways. However, the increment, if there is 
an increment of cost there, it's so minute you're

01:57.166 --> 02:05.254
not going to be able to find it. Yes, there is. It's 
obvious. I'm not going to sit down over here and

02:09.218 --> 02:12.901
argue the point at all. If you had a grid system, for 
example, a grid system of streets,

02:13.421 --> 02:23.691
and then the reason to assume Like you're going to 
put a manhole over here, a manhole over here, and

02:24.025 --> 02:30.772
every 300 feet, you're going to have another 
manhole. If those streets instead of being

02:30.792 --> 02:39.361
straight, on the curve, you cannot stretch a piece 
of pipe. You cannot curve a piece of pipe around it.

02:42.123 --> 02:43.565
Pipes are going to have to be straight. And 
therefore, every time you get away from the cord,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.143
system, and then you've got to put another 
manhole. Another manhole, that's another $900,

02:52.163 --> 02:55.387
for example. So that's an additional cost. 
However, in the overall, when it costs you $10,000

02:57.168 --> 03:09.061
per lot of water source and drainage and roads to 
develop, that cost is lost, really. Aside from

03:09.081 --> 03:17.910
that, that cost is associated with municipal 
utility districts, which is like a mortgage. You

03:18.211 --> 03:22.977
pay over a 30-year period, so you don't even see it, 
really. It's not even the quote of the purchase and

03:22.997 --> 03:28.345
the price, because you pay over a 30-year period of 
time. So that's your only disadvantage, if any, I

03:29.166 --> 03:39.800
would call it

03:29.166 --> 03:39.800
that. Well, I think that's about all I can pick up to 
ask about. Maybe, is there anything we have? There

03:45.428 --> 03:47.931
are some beautiful things that we have done. very 
timely basis, really, because we are associated

03:48.097 --> 03:57.366
with the development on day in and day out. Like, 
for example, Lake Woodlands. It was a very timely,

04:00.089 --> 04:04.253
very timely type of a project. It was during the 
downturn of the economy, really, where Mr.

04:04.834 --> 04:15.825
Mitchell said that since we have the plans and the 
permit to do the Lake Woodlands, Let's go ahead and

04:16.312 --> 04:26.485
see if we can find a contractor who is willing to 
keep his equipment busy and see if they're willing

04:16.312 --> 04:26.485
to give us a good price and do liquid. And we looked 
around. We found somebody up in Wisconsin who had a

04:27.927 --> 04:34.034
whole bunch of equipment, really, available. And 
he wanted to put them in here. And then we started

04:36.858 --> 04:40.642
looking around over here from local people. 
Zachary Construction out of San Antonio, they had

04:40.662 --> 04:44.327
a whole bunch of equipment. They did a beautiful 
job there, very little cost. Not very little cost.

04:52.374 --> 04:52.554
Sure. They kept the- But it was- They did not make 
any profit. Compared to what you had spent five

04:54.897 --> 04:57.861
years earlier, it was- Right. Or- Yeah. That is 
correct, because they did not want- they did not-

04:58.281 --> 05:07.493
they were trying to keep their personnel busy so 
they would not lose their organization and their

04:58.281 --> 05:07.493
equipment. The equipment- idle equipment, you 
know, they're just a waste, not a waste. At least

05:11.218 --> 05:12.660
this way they were able to keep their personnel 
busy. to maintain their organization and also

05:13.332 --> 05:18.157
keep their costs down. Your work is running. You 
work five years in advance of what happens, I

05:20.260 --> 05:24.304
guess. And more so. More than five years. It starts 
anywhere from one year to about before the house is

05:26.627 --> 05:30.612
on. I would say our work is finished about 12 months 
before you find the elements of the house or the

05:31.272 --> 05:41.584
community, from one year all the way up to 10 years 
ahead. We've heard different dates now for

05:41.699 --> 05:47.348
completing, if there is such a thing as completing 
the Woodmans. Do you have any idea what you're

05:47.368 --> 05:48.951
looking at? All depends what you call complete. 
Yeah, that's the problem. I don't think the

05:52.357 --> 05:55.101
Woodmans will ever complete. I would say the 
substantial part of it, if the economy stays where

05:55.261 --> 06:07.842
it is, the Sun Belt is supposed to be getting a very 
big play as far as relocation is concerned across

05:55.261 --> 06:07.842
the country. If that all happens, I would say 30 
years from now, then 2020 would be the year, I

06:08.513 --> 06:17.525
suppose, that you can call the wilderness 
substantially complete. Yeah, we've got to pick

06:17.545 --> 06:18.727
up that. Substantial completion. Never finish, 
yeah. I suppose that this, where we are right now,

06:22.532 --> 06:26.918
is about 20 years old. 20 years old is far. 
Ordinarily, if in about 10 years' time, if the

06:29.742 --> 06:37.693
downtown area here in the wilderness takes 
substance, I'm certain that this building over

06:38.315 --> 06:41.860
here is going to come down for something. 
Something else? Something bigger than that. Do

06:46.928 --> 07:01.449
you anticipate the great expansion that has been 
projected as changing the character, possibly,

06:46.928 --> 07:01.449
of the woodlands, or creating greater 
difficulties in carrying out this basic theme of

06:46.928 --> 07:01.449
preservation of the environment? No. The people 
who live here in the wilderness, the people who

07:04.876 --> 07:21.059
will carry the ball after us, I believe they will 
see it fit to maintain, because they're not going

07:04.876 --> 07:21.059
to be able to recreate the natural environment 
that we have been able to maintain. There's going

07:21.079 --> 07:25.024
to be some scouring, and there's going to be some 
scars left. But you would be surprised how quickly

07:25.705 --> 07:31.253
this land heals itself. If you, I don't know if you 
probably have taking rides around here at night.

07:38.110 --> 07:45.020
If you take some of the major roads, you know, and 
you would see that you're in the forest. You know,

07:45.040 --> 07:51.488
you cannot see through the woods there that there 
are houses on the other side of the buffer zones.

07:51.628 --> 08:04.245
And I guarantee you, I guarantee you that when we 
started putting those roads in, when we started to

07:51.628 --> 08:04.245
put those roads in, we had really morally damaged 
the ground. Damage it. Because when you have mud

08:05.387 --> 08:13.259
over here and you have a big old D8, you know, trying 
to make inroads, they don't want to get stuck.

08:13.319 --> 08:15.983
They're going to move around, wiggle around. 
Really, you will think that they're desecrating

08:16.404 --> 08:19.969
the land. I have to give it two or three years' time 
and you see how it heals up. It heals up very

08:25.317 --> 08:26.399
quickly. In this type of an environment, if you 
don't destroy the understory, The healing

08:31.040 --> 08:38.756
capabilities of the ground are tremendous over 
here. We have a lot of water, a lot of sunshine. It

08:41.321 --> 08:43.986
really comes like .

08:47.373 --> 08:48.556
Well, sir, we sure thank you. Appreciate it very 
much. Anytime.
