WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:07.384
OK, let's try a volume check.

00:07.404 --> 00:10.588
Hey, before you turn this off. OK, this is Ron 
Shorn, and I'm interviewing Jack Brandt. And for

00:13.631 --> 00:16.153
the record, give your full name. My entire full 
name? John Conrad Brandt, Jr. OK, and when were you

00:19.957 --> 00:25.363
born? I was born on, well, that's actually a tricky 
question. but it will give you insight into how my

00:31.351 --> 00:35.416
life has gone. I was actually born on August 7th, 
1934. Both my mother and father agreed that I was

00:40.723 --> 00:44.868
born on August 7th, 1934. However, the city of St. 
Louis says I was born on August 8th, 1934. So it

00:52.664 --> 01:02.794
turns out I ran afoul of bureaucracy essentially 
on square one and have been running afoul of

00:52.664 --> 01:02.794
bureaucracies ever since. How did you get 
interested in astronomy?

01:08.220 --> 01:16.268
You know, that is really hard to say, but I can, it's 
the kind of thing that I think is very natural to

01:08.220 --> 01:16.268
people. But the specific thing that I can remember 
is writing a paper very early in my college career

01:24.642 --> 01:36.954
on the determination of the speed of light by Ole 
Romer and whoever worked with him from the

01:24.642 --> 01:36.954
satellites at Jupiter. And I was impressed that 
such a basically simple approach to a fairly

01:38.136 --> 01:51.069
fundamental observation could yield, ballpark, 
the correct results. And this idea of being able to

01:54.832 --> 02:04.121
use your wits to determine what's going on in a 
cosmic sense appealed to me, and I guess it was

01:54.832 --> 02:04.121
downhill from there on. Where'd you get your 
undergraduate degree and when? Undergraduate

02:07.764 --> 02:11.808
degree at Washington University in St. Louis in 
1956. And what was your major? Mathematics. Okay,

02:15.552 --> 02:17.914
and then where'd you go to grad school? I went to 
grad school twice. The first time was at the

02:19.556 --> 02:22.138
University of Chicago. 56 to 60 when I got a degree, 
PhD in astronomy. And then due to various

02:30.616 --> 02:46.084
malfeasances of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration from 1981 to 1983, I went to

02:30.616 --> 02:46.084
graduate school at Loyola College in Baltimore 
and obtained a Master of Business

02:30.616 --> 02:46.084
Administration. Who was your thesis advisor? 
What was your thesis? My thesis was on different

02:51.185 --> 02:58.535
ways of producing Lyman-alpha radiation in the 
solar system. This included some planets and

02:58.595 --> 03:07.709
what was then called the interplanetary medium. 
The solar wind hadn't actually been fully

03:07.729 --> 03:10.513
invented yet. It was around but not used. And my 
thesis advisor was Joseph Chamberlain. How did

03:17.232 --> 03:19.875
you get interested in that field? Did they pick 
you, or did you go around and pick something else?

03:23.500 --> 03:24.942
It was sort of a little bit of both. When I first went 
to Yerkes, I was, of course, taking courses. And I

03:30.508 --> 03:41.422
had a one-year research assistantship on the 
astrometry project that was being run by Kai

03:30.508 --> 03:41.422
Strand at the time. And I quickly determined that I 
was not all that interested in astrometry. and

03:47.168 --> 04:13.902
this guy named joe chamberlain seemed to be doing 
interesting physics in the atmospheres of

03:47.168 --> 04:13.902
planets and he was also working on solar wind 
theory at the time so the uh the juncture was

03:47.168 --> 04:13.902
natural and i think he's been very productive um 
where did you go after you got your phd okay first

03:47.168 --> 04:13.902
year after the phd i spent i was a something called 
an nsf cooperative Cooperative, oh boy, it's been

04:15.923 --> 04:20.389
a long time. But some kind of postdoctoral 
fellowship that involved the postdoctoral

04:21.590 --> 04:31.042
institution contributing resources and NSF paid 
the salary. And that was essentially late 60 to

04:31.763 --> 04:39.152
late 61 at Mount Wilson and Palomar, literally on 
813 Santa Barbara Street. And where'd you go from

04:40.674 --> 04:41.515
there? And I came to Berkeley. and I stayed here a 
year and a half and then I went to Kitt Peak in early

04:44.172 --> 05:13.065
63 and stayed there for three years and then in 66 I 
went to the Goddard Institute for Space Studies

04:44.172 --> 05:13.065
and stayed there about a year and they were then 
trying to get people to go to Goddard and run things

04:44.172 --> 05:13.065
so I started out in the solar physics branch in 1967 
as Ed was the technical title, and then I was made

05:13.805 --> 05:33.093
chief of the Laboratory for Solar Physics, and 
that evolved and amalgamated, and for about the

05:13.805 --> 05:33.093
last 10 years at Goddard, which ended in 87, so from 
77 to 87, I was chief of the Laboratory for

05:13.805 --> 05:33.093
Astronomy and Solar Physics. And then you wrote, 
and then you went? And then I went to the University

05:37.379 --> 05:43.187
of Colorado, where I am senior research associate 
and Professor Perrin Attendant Rank, close

05:43.538 --> 05:47.583
Perrin. I'm just, I'm not making this up. I'll give 
you my card if you don't believe it, of

05:50.726 --> 05:57.134
astrophysical, planetary, and atmospheric 
sciences. We require documentation for that, so

05:57.154 --> 06:02.480
if you want to save some tape.

06:05.663 --> 06:07.686
Okay, do you consider yourself an astronomer? 
Yeah. Do you consider yourself a solar system

06:08.952 --> 06:11.597
astronomer? A what? A solar system or planetary 
astronomer or just a plain astronomer? I consider

06:15.764 --> 06:16.605
both. Usually the world, for reasons which are not 
sound, describes all astronomers into solar

06:18.569 --> 06:29.407
system people and the equivalent of 
astrophysicists. I am both. Back in the early 60s,

06:33.421 --> 06:42.634
did you feel looked down upon by real 
quote-unquote astronomers? Well, I'm

06:42.834 --> 06:48.562
absolutely sure that real astronomers tried to 
look down on me, but I didn't let them. And I'm being

06:49.343 --> 06:50.785
slightly serious. I, for quite some time, have 
chosen the things to work on that I was interested

06:51.506 --> 07:00.238
in for what I perceive to be their intrinsic 
purpose. merit and interest to me, and if somebody

07:00.590 --> 07:07.079
else doesn't think that's important, that's, in 
my personal opinion, their problem. Do you think

07:08.981 --> 07:17.373
that real astronomers look down on planetary 
anything, you know, closer in the light year, back

07:08.981 --> 07:17.373
in the 60s, and do they do it now? Well, they 
certainly did in the 60s,

07:17.393 --> 07:29.449
but, you know, this is simply a mental aberration 
that should not be unduly dignified. There is a

07:30.020 --> 07:41.652
huge tendency in astronomy for anybody working in 
any field to regard anything that that person is

07:30.020 --> 07:41.652
not personally working on as unimportant. And I 
think it far transcends the astrophysicist

07:41.672 --> 07:55.487
looking down on the solar system people, and you 
can even take it farther, and then you get into the

07:41.672 --> 07:55.487
astrophysicist, the people that work on 
cosmology and quasars look down on the stellar

07:41.672 --> 07:55.487
people. And it's sort of another form of prejudice 
in our society that shouldn't be unduly

07:55.973 --> 08:02.081
dignified. What was astronomy and planetary 
astronomy like when you got started as opposed to

08:02.101 --> 08:09.311
today? I don't know about as opposed to today. We 
were just starting to get into missions to

08:11.233 --> 08:15.859
planets, which of course were very exciting. And a 
lot of the work that I did first with Joe

08:17.081 --> 08:24.090
Chamberlain with myself was some of the first work 
done on For example, Lyman-Alpha from the

08:24.543 --> 08:38.955
planets, and half of my astronomer friends didn't 
know what Lyman-Alpha was, which I found somewhat

08:24.543 --> 08:38.955
amusing, but I'm sorry, I tilted it back at the 
wrong time. What's the best piece of work that you

08:39.015 --> 08:41.377
think you've done? It had to be carved on a 
tombstone.

08:48.043 --> 08:52.186
That would be awfully hard to pin down. As you know, 
Ron, my approach to astronomy has been somewhat

08:54.698 --> 08:58.161
eclectic. I've done archaeoastronomy. I've done 
rotation curves of galaxies, fiddled with the GUM

09:00.103 --> 09:04.888
nebula. I was the principal investigator for the 
GHRS, which has contributed to lots of

09:05.929 --> 09:12.976
disciplines. I have helped found the 
International Halley Watch. I helped start the

09:18.021 --> 09:23.507
Solar Maximum Mission. Anything that I have done, 
the more recent stuff that I'm doing right now, I'm

09:23.757 --> 09:29.645
as proud of as anything. That is, I think we have 
pinned down to within all a reasonable doubt what

09:30.566 --> 09:42.522
the source of disconnection events in comets 
might be. And the answer is magnetic reconnection

09:43.884 --> 09:48.550
of sector boundaries. which is what we proposed 15 
years ago, but we didn't have, that was a good

09:49.120 --> 09:54.946
speculation, we didn't have the evidence to back 
it up. I think we have the evidence now, but it's

09:55.006 --> 10:00.853
sort of like asking somebody what their favorite 
child is. I view whatever my contribution is to

10:00.873 --> 10:16.329
astronomy to be in multiple areas, including 
trying to run a NASA laboratory intelligently,

10:00.873 --> 10:16.329
helping sell missions. I think 50 years from now, 
The stuff I did on the International Halley Watch

10:19.057 --> 10:22.440
may be what I'm remembered by. I really don't know. 
What was the most fun with the thing you did?

10:30.787 --> 10:32.709
Well, you know, that is very hard to say. I think 
selling the GHRS because everybody told us as

10:32.749 --> 10:47.342
Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph on the 
Hubble Space Telescope, everybody told us in 1976

10:32.749 --> 10:47.342
and 1977 that a proposal from a NASA lab didn't have 
a chance of a snowball and you know where. And, of

10:47.862 --> 10:52.027
course, we were category one and selected and it's 
up and working. So, again, when you want singles,

10:52.047 --> 11:01.417
you know, I'll tell you stuff that I consider to be 
exciting and productive, but it's hard to pin

10:52.047 --> 11:01.417
down. Did you ever have any dead ends, misfires, 
things like that? Sure. Dead ends and misfires. I

11:07.384 --> 11:12.529
had a most wonderful theory of the blue clearing on 
Mars. That would be totally wrong. But it was a

11:15.513 --> 11:16.654
great theory. What was it? Well, at that time, 
there was evidence, which we now know to be false,

11:18.567 --> 11:26.057
that the solar wind might stop around 2 AU. And so we 
postulated that it stopped, obviously, around

11:27.179 --> 11:34.549
the orbit of Mars and that the eccentricity would 
carry it in and out of this boundary. Absolutely

11:35.370 --> 11:39.055
wonderful theory that had nothing to do with 
reality. When did you first cross swords with an

11:39.916 --> 11:42.760
ASA? First official contact. Yeah, I wouldn't say 
that I had crossed swords with NASA, although...

11:49.021 --> 11:50.503
When did you first cross paths? Although NASA 
might have an order to do.

11:58.074 --> 12:13.557
Well, I was, whilst at Kitt Peak, involved with, I 
think it was Mariner 4, with an experiment that

11:58.074 --> 12:13.557
Charlie Barth was doing when he was still at JPL. 
Now, I may have this a little garbled, because as

12:14.617 --> 12:19.641
you know, that was 30 years ago. And

12:19.801 --> 12:26.787
something happened, and we were all summarily 
tossed off the mission. And it apparently

12:26.807 --> 12:32.572
bothered Charlie so much that he moved to the 
University of Colorado, where he was my director

12:26.807 --> 12:32.572
for five years. That was probably it, my first one. 
But clearly, when I became a NASA employee and a

12:37.857 --> 12:43.982
NASA

12:44.722 --> 12:50.450
branch head and then a lab chief, it was a long 
interaction for about 20 years. And I will say, it

12:51.391 --> 12:57.740
was only towards the end that the cost-benefit 
ratio went strongly unfavorable. In the 60s, if

12:58.461 --> 13:05.190
you were in NASA and had good ideas and were willing 
to work hard, you could get really neat things

12:58.461 --> 13:05.190
done. Like we sold the SMM mission. Solar maximum 
mission. Yeah, sorry. So we sold that, and I think

13:11.719 --> 13:14.222
it's been one of the most productive solar 
missions around. And then we, done with that, we

13:15.889 --> 13:21.296
sold the Goddard high resolution spectrograph. 
And we helped start the Halley watch. And you can go

13:23.980 --> 13:25.042
down the list. But now, generally speaking, even 
if you have a good idea and you're willing to work

13:25.062 --> 13:30.589
hard, it doesn't matter. It's not going to happen 
anyway. In general, do you think NASA's handled

13:32.552 --> 13:39.141
planetary science good or bad?

13:42.025 --> 13:44.108
Or average? Let's start with the pluses, and then 
we'll try to draw a conclusion. It's done a lot. I

13:49.943 --> 13:59.117
mean, we've had missions to Mercury and Venus and 
Mars and Jupiter and Uranus, Saturn, Neptune. So,

13:59.137 --> 14:06.828
you know, it's hard to fault the accomplishments, 
in my opinion, of the NASA planetary missions. You

14:06.848 --> 14:10.153
know, missions to the moon, we've got rocks, you 
know, a whole bit. And Mars observers on its way. It

14:13.147 --> 14:16.291
doesn't have any significant problems that I know 
of, and Galileo's one as well. It does have a

14:16.331 --> 14:21.378
significant problem, but you can probably recoup 
a fair amount of that. I've heard a number of people

14:21.398 --> 14:30.630
say that NASA gets the pretty pictures and then 
cuts off the money before the data is really

14:21.398 --> 14:30.630
properly examined and published. Is that true? I 
think you can take two views of that, and then let's

14:32.653 --> 14:37.720
try to decide which is correct.

14:39.573 --> 14:56.091
Certainly that tendency, and especially under 
the new administrator, Daniel Golden, I think

14:39.573 --> 14:56.091
there is even more than normal an inclination to 
launch something and skim the cream and then

14:39.573 --> 14:56.091
declare victory and go home. The old NASA motto 
among the troops was build it, launch it, and

14:57.072 --> 15:04.180
forget it, and I'm afraid we're going back to that. 
under the management that's been around for the

15:04.717 --> 15:33.424
last 10 years or so, largely involving people like 
Len Fisk, I think there was a tendency to

15:04.717 --> 15:33.424
understand that when you built something like 
this, that the risk part was in the building,

15:04.717 --> 15:33.424
testing, and launching, and that the mission 
part, so-called M-O-N-D-A in NASA parlance,

15:04.717 --> 15:33.424
mission operations and data analysis, is the good 
part, the cream-skimming, the gravy, But

15:35.075 --> 15:37.878
regrettably, I think we're going back to that. So I 
think it is a real problem. The thought of turning

15:42.424 --> 15:49.292
off things like Magellan I think sets a precedent 
which I really don't even want to think about. But

15:49.312 --> 15:51.375
it is almost surely going to happen. So I would say 
that NASA, up until semi-recently, has improved

15:52.296 --> 16:02.348
in that area over the early days. But now they seem 
to be regressing backward into the old build,

16:02.783 --> 16:10.952
launch, and forget syndrome. Or do you think 
planetary astronomy would be today without the

16:12.654 --> 16:18.861
money that NASA's put into it? We wouldn't even 
recognize it. We've gone places and seen things

16:23.006 --> 16:29.053
that we just absolutely could not do from Earth. We 
do a lot from Earth. Having a mix of ground-based

16:31.252 --> 16:41.883
and space and in situ and theory and all of the above 
is the way you make progress. Do you feel that

16:41.924 --> 16:47.730
people at headquarters in the past and in the 
present really understand what the troops in the

16:41.924 --> 16:47.730
field are doing? Do they keep up with the science? I 
really don't know how to answer that. I deal mostly

16:54.898 --> 17:00.904
now in my astrophysical hat with Ed Weiler, who is 
very knowledgeable about what's going on, and

17:01.812 --> 17:24.532
with, in my planetary hat, with Jurgen Rahi, who I 
would say the same thing, but they are in an

17:01.812 --> 17:24.532
environment which is, I think, charitably fire 
drill oriented, and whether they can spend enough

17:01.812 --> 17:24.532
time to keep fully up to date, I don't know, but I 
think they make a very good effort. Whether the

17:25.733 --> 17:30.857
top, remember this is the discipline chief level, 
And these people invariably are or were active

17:31.208 --> 17:36.995
scientists. And I think their ability to keep up 
with what's going on is relatively good. As you

17:44.843 --> 18:00.321
then go higher in the NASA hierarchy, where, 
frankly, most of the decisions are made, I think

17:44.843 --> 18:00.321
the organization tends to be out of touch with 
anything outside the Beltway. 30 years ago, there

18:00.942 --> 18:03.645
was just an American Astronomical Society. Now 
there are all these sub-societies. And the first

18:06.228 --> 18:09.251
one, I guess, was the Division of Planetary 
Sciences. Has that been a good thing or a bad thing

18:09.651 --> 18:15.838
for A, planetary astronomy, and B, astronomy in 
general? I am one of the last holdouts against the

18:15.858 --> 18:23.146
Division of Planetary Sciences. I only joined 
last year. I believe that the... The vision does

18:29.309 --> 18:45.376
serve a useful purpose in bringing everybody 
together, and I now religiously go to the

18:29.309 --> 18:45.376
meetings, but I think it has also further helped to 
drive the wedge between the planetary community

18:29.309 --> 18:45.376
and the other community. They never did talk very 
much to each other. No, but this sort of makes it

18:50.124 --> 18:54.692
official.

18:55.769 --> 19:03.038
Thirty years ago, Icarus was an obscure journal 
publishing obscure papers by Bulgarians,

18:55.769 --> 19:03.038
Austrian mechanics, and you've got to give Carl 
Sagan credit. He really changed that around. Do

19:05.922 --> 19:09.106
you happen to know who wrote the first paper in 
Icarus? Well, you did. Yes, thank you. I'm talking

19:12.531 --> 19:14.834
about the majority of papers, all right? It turns 
out that paper was wrong, incidentally, but...

19:18.601 --> 19:21.805
Which came to a shock to Joe Burns. I did what I told 
him. Do you think the rise of Icarus has been a good

19:23.948 --> 19:25.771
thing? I mean, we don't see planetary papers in the 
APJ anymore, not that we saw a whole lot of them.

19:29.656 --> 19:40.671
Well, I still publish some of my planetary papers 
in APJ, and I publish some in Icarus, and I publish

19:29.656 --> 19:40.671
some in AJ, and I plan to publish some in ANA. As I 
described earlier, a lot of this work I've been

19:41.752 --> 19:46.819
doing with DEs and the Halley data has all come to 
fruition, so there's a flock of papers coming out.

19:48.720 --> 19:57.092
Astronomy and Astrophysics, the so-called 
European Journal, which is about international

19:48.720 --> 19:57.092
or anything. I think Icarus has been turned into a 
first-rate journal. Whether or not those papers

20:04.523 --> 20:10.892
would have been published anywhere somewhere 
else, I couldn't possibly tell you. You think,

20:10.912 --> 20:14.157
take this meeting now, do you think the 
astronomers... Here, this is your personal

20:14.390 --> 20:17.914
opinion again, that they look down on planetary 
astronomy now. Is there a grudging acceptance? Is

20:19.415 --> 20:20.757
there a wholehearted acceptance? I honestly 
don't know. And that stems from not caring. Some

20:24.901 --> 20:26.503
may. I'm sure there's some that do. But, you know, 
so what? Here's a particular and a general

20:29.526 --> 20:33.611
question. The particular one is, what's the 
reaction you get from people you meet on the

20:34.392 --> 20:39.317
airplane when you tell them you're an astronomer? 
Oh, that's easy. When I tell an astronomer it's

20:41.699 --> 20:47.446
wonderful, when I tell them I work on Hubble, it's 
not so wonderful. And for the first year or so after

20:47.466 --> 20:53.954
the spherical aberration was discovered, I did 
not volunteer that information. Things have, the

20:54.495 --> 21:05.288
general public perception has improved to the 
point where I can now volunteer it without

20:54.495 --> 21:05.288
risking, you know, three hours with the person 
next to you beating you over the head verbally.

21:05.622 --> 21:10.687
What do you think the public's general attitude 
towards planetary astronomy and astronomy in

21:05.622 --> 21:10.687
general? I think the public has fantastic support 
for the general mission of astronomy in general

21:10.707 --> 21:24.462
and of NASA in terms of exploration of space and 
orbiting observatories in particular. I find

21:25.603 --> 21:32.450
that it's the political process where the support 
tends to weaken. But I give lots of public talks. I

21:36.255 --> 21:48.046
personally figure I'm supported by public monies 
and giving talks on my work on Hubble and whatever

21:36.255 --> 21:48.046
else is part of the territory, and I find 
tremendous reception. Do you think planetary

21:48.066 --> 21:55.794
astronomers in particular and astronomers in 
general have done as good a job as they could in

21:48.066 --> 21:55.794
selling themselves to the public in Congress? 
Undoubtedly not. No question. On the other hand,

22:03.824 --> 22:10.393
Would you agree that there's probably more 
realization now that, you know, getting paid by

22:03.824 --> 22:10.393
the public, you've got to tell them. Is that true? 
Would you go on with that?

22:14.779 --> 22:16.321
I doubt that, actually. I think in some levels that 
is well perceived, but I continue to meet people

22:16.341 --> 22:25.273
who regard their intellectual inquiry almost as a 
divine right. Just give me the money and don't ask

22:26.114 --> 22:27.756
questions. Exactly. I'm smart. I'm uncovering 
the secrets of the universe. Send the check. uh how

22:33.912 --> 23:03.852
good a job have we done with the congress we've 
probably done even worse with the congress we tend

22:33.912 --> 23:03.852
like almost all segments of u.s society to respond 
only to at 11 59

22:33.912 --> 23:03.852
on a scale of 12 o'clock to impending disasters 
when something that's near and dear to our heart is

22:33.912 --> 23:03.852
about to be canceled we spring into action but we 
don't do the homework that would have prevented us

23:04.135 --> 23:06.318
from getting in that situation in the first place? 
Well, we haven't found life anywhere, any trace of

23:08.422 --> 23:16.714
evidence of life anywhere in the solar system 
except where we know it is on Earth. Do we? Well, we

23:18.096 --> 23:19.278
haven't found it yet. What's the evidence part? 
Make good beer. All right. Has that had any effect

23:24.646 --> 23:31.957
on funding and public interest, the fact that 
there's epidural martians?

23:31.977 --> 23:32.438
I doubt it. You know, these are, quote, finding of 
life, unquote, is such a long shot. I think most

23:41.012 --> 23:43.075
people understand what the odds are. A lot of 
people have gotten a lot of publicity and money, I

23:44.698 --> 23:56.396
guess, lately, pushing topics like killer 
asteroids, ozone holes, search for

23:44.698 --> 23:56.396
extraterrestrial intelligence, other solar 
systems. You think they're overdoing it?

24:02.658 --> 24:07.625
Let me just comment on the killer asteroid 
syndrome. Nothing that I personally know of

24:09.468 --> 24:14.555
that's being done there is bad science. In fact, 
there's a lot of good science there. And it's an

24:17.439 --> 24:19.261
area that I have some interest. I am trying to get 
modest funding to do searches for small comets. It

24:25.330 --> 24:31.298
turns out that really is a different problem if you 
read the space watch survey carefully. I believe,

24:32.864 --> 24:41.112
however, that Congress is funding it for what they 
believe to be the danger to Earth. And although

24:42.213 --> 24:46.897
there clearly is a danger to Earth, I think that is 
probably overblown. It probably won't do any harm

24:48.498 --> 24:50.420
either.

24:53.343 --> 24:58.728
What killed planetary, essentially killed 
planetary astronomy early in the century? Is it

24:58.748 --> 25:00.930
just Percival Hall that we run out of? I really 
don't know the answer to that question. Partly the

25:06.612 --> 25:15.240
reason I don't like to put, first of all, don't 
know, but even if I thought I did, a lot of these

25:06.612 --> 25:15.240
things tend to go in cycles. And it's sort of like 
education, you know, we use phonics and then it's

25:17.101 --> 25:22.126
whatever, whatever, whatever. So I don't take 
short-term fluctuations too seriously, and I

25:22.546 --> 25:30.833
think under the last 20, 25 years with NASA and all 
the way... direct missions that the planetary

25:31.471 --> 25:39.243
astronomy may have gotten the lion's share of 
something, and if it goes back the other way, so

25:31.471 --> 25:39.243
what? What's the state of planetary astronomy 
today? Plus, minus, zero? I still think it's a

25:46.293 --> 25:47.375
plus.

25:50.820 --> 25:57.630
And keeping it a plus, in my view, depends on... 
Three things. Continued vitality at the young

25:58.701 --> 26:02.444
investigator level. In other words, enough funds 
to keep a crop

26:02.905 --> 26:12.313
of fresh blood, fresh ideas coming into the field. 
The development, that's one. Two is the

26:15.496 --> 26:21.862
development of good ground-based capabilities 
for observations of planets. And the third is

26:21.922 --> 26:27.347
keeping a reasonable semblance of the space 
program going. Of the three, I worry most about the

26:28.087 --> 26:31.391
last one, number three. But they're all 
intertwined at a rather good level. And so even as

26:38.418 --> 26:44.425
we speak, again, we have Galileo and Mars 
Observer. And so my big question is, where is the

26:45.206 --> 26:49.831
next planetary mission coming from? Will it be the 
Discovery series? Will it be a larger mission,

26:52.634 --> 26:57.840
whatever?

26:58.428 --> 27:04.994
In the last 30 years since NASI got into business, 
the taxpayers have spent a lot of money on

26:58.428 --> 27:04.994
planetary astronomy. What do you think they've 
gotten back from it? I think they got a lot of

27:09.899 --> 27:11.160
excitement. I frankly think that that money, 
generally speaking, has been well spent and that

27:11.260 --> 27:25.594
enough has come of it that is straightforward and 
reasonably simple to understand. You don't need

27:26.535 --> 27:27.996
to be... and a professional astronomer to look at 
an image of a planet at a new resolution or a new

27:29.292 --> 27:38.300
wavelength and see there's brand new stuff going 
on there. I find that, again, when I talk to people

27:39.441 --> 27:54.834
in a public type, you know, the Kiwanis Club, ARP is 
one of my, they're desperate always for programs

27:39.441 --> 27:54.834
where I live, so they keep calling me up, that the 
people appreciate what is being done. I don't

27:54.854 --> 27:57.797
think that when people hear that the NASA budget is 
1% of the federal budget, that they consider that

27:58.233 --> 28:05.429
ill-spent at all? Most people think it's 10% or 
15%, incidentally, which is not true. But again,

28:10.901 --> 28:14.048
perception is the problem here. Let's get a 
particular case now. The University of Colorado

28:16.930 --> 28:22.418
doesn't have any conservatory or anything. 
Again, I'm asking questions, and you know I know

28:22.758 --> 28:25.662
some of the answers to them. But how did space 
science and planetary astronomy get going at

28:26.143 --> 28:30.789
Colorado? Space science had a really long 
tradition, starting right after World War II with

28:30.809 --> 28:40.543
what was then the physics department. I mean, 
people like Bill Rentsch, doing

28:43.019 --> 28:50.929
spectroscopy of first the sun and other solar 
system objects from rockets. And this has gone on

28:52.150 --> 29:01.682
through the years, and I think one of the other 
important things was Charlie Barth coming to the

28:52.150 --> 29:01.682
University of Colorado. It has then been 
formulated as a goal of the university to be one of

29:01.702 --> 29:10.613
the preeminent centers of space research in the 
country. So I think it started right after World

29:11.774 --> 29:17.220
War II with rockets, mostly launched from White 
Sands. And then it has developed into the more

29:18.322 --> 29:23.127
ambitious programs, the missions to planets. And 
one of the major OSO 8 experiments was at the

29:24.449 --> 29:34.541
University of Colorado.

29:37.444 --> 29:38.906
So I think that pretty much does it. Now, of course, 
we're a major force in the industry. We have a major

29:42.258 --> 29:45.262
new building where we build the instruments. And 
one of our new instruments is one Larry Esposito is

29:46.805 --> 29:52.392
building for Cassini. Mission to Saturn, 
studying rings and everything else. So he's

29:57.899 --> 29:59.822
standing pretty good with the administration.

30:02.185 --> 30:03.266
Not sure what that means. We win our share of the 
competitions, which is the way all these things

30:08.626 --> 30:18.636
are selected, and we have areas of 
world-recognized expertise, detectors,

30:08.626 --> 30:18.636
systems, et cetera. Just out of curiosity, what 
percentage of undergrad students actually get

30:20.598 --> 30:28.366
any exposure to astronomy? I can't, well, first 
you have to define that. There is an

30:31.569 --> 30:37.215
undergraduate, you know, astronomy one type 
course, and that has hundreds of people. So

30:38.309 --> 30:41.373
there's some fraction that way. For a long time, 
there was a satellite called SME, the Solar

30:41.814 --> 30:56.916
Mesospheric Explorer, where undergraduates 
could actually go in and learn how to operate a

30:41.814 --> 30:56.916
spacecraft. And for a long time, we were the only 
university that was operating their own

30:57.597 --> 31:04.266
spacecraft, and we did it. with the proper 
supervision, but literally with undergraduate

31:04.786 --> 31:08.310
students. And the University of Colorado has also 
had a fair number of people go on into the astronaut

31:09.231 --> 31:18.080
corps. Alan Shepard and there are others. I don't 
want to start down the list because I'll surely

31:24.608 --> 31:28.752
forget one, but there's a bunch. um people are 
still churning out grad students in space science

31:29.305 --> 31:58.283
and planetary astronomy and regular astronomy 
when is that going to stop or is it well all economic

31:29.305 --> 31:58.283
systems are self-correcting i try to be fairly 
candid with my students about what their job

31:29.305 --> 31:58.283
chances are and they're not i tell them they're not 
what they used to be some of these people have

31:29.305 --> 31:58.283
almost built in things like one of my very best 
graduate students is from Korea. He wants to go

32:01.452 --> 32:02.734
back to Korea. He'll get a job in Korea because he 
has a prestigious education and all that kind of

32:03.054 --> 32:08.661
thing. But that's long ago. This was probably 20 
years ago when I was doing some teaching at the

32:11.624 --> 32:16.290
University of Maryland. While I was at Goddard, I 
had an adjoint professorship at Maryland. And

32:21.496 --> 32:23.578
Gart Westerhout used to give him the incoming 
students a little sheet of paper that said, okay,

32:23.862 --> 32:27.846
here you are. We'll be happy to educate you, but you 
really ought to know that you might not get a job

32:28.286 --> 32:38.416
studying cosmology at Mount Wilson and Palomar 
Observatories. You might wind up teaching in a

32:38.456 --> 32:45.662
small college or working for IBM or CSC or 
something like that. I think a lot of people are

32:46.043 --> 32:47.865
being honest about it. A lot of students, students 
that are... come into graduate school or at an age

32:51.807 --> 33:00.552
they're not always amenable to that kind of 
advice, to put it mildly, and you can't do anything

32:51.807 --> 33:00.552
about that. But I believe if you're honest up 
front, you're okay. Do you think planetary

33:05.611 --> 33:09.999
astronomy is kind of mined out as regards big 
discoveries? Nonsense. Professor Ari was not

33:13.885 --> 33:16.530
correct 100 years ago. No, he was not. Because 
that's something that several people have

33:18.794 --> 33:22.300
mentioned. They say, well, you know, we now know 
what the backside of the moon looks like.

33:28.250 --> 33:30.454
But there's no evidence of it. I think that's a very 
basic lack of understanding of what intellectual

33:30.653 --> 33:37.862
inquiry and knowledge are all about. The day we 
quote, know everything.

33:44.870 --> 33:48.695
Between the super colliding superconductor and 
the space station, it's easy. Which one do you

33:49.836 --> 33:50.397
want? Pick the super colliding superconductor. 
That's going to tell us something that we would

33:52.419 --> 33:58.787
actually like to know rather than have WPA for the 
command program. or the people's program.

34:03.495 --> 34:06.440
What happened in planetary astronomy? Well, 
missions got more and more complex and more and

34:07.741 --> 34:14.792
more expensive, and I guess Viking was the 
ultimate one. And then what happened? Did the

34:16.815 --> 34:25.427
money just dry up, or did people say, wait a minute, 
the next mission's going to cost the gross

34:16.815 --> 34:25.427
national product, or what actually happened?

34:25.447 --> 34:27.390
Hard to say in detail, but To the human nature, 
everything tends to escalate in expense and

34:28.180 --> 34:34.449
complexity. You know, Toyotas and Nissans or 
Datsuns, as they were then called 10 years ago,

34:35.791 --> 34:45.125
were at the low end of the curve, and they kept 
creeping up and creeping up. And the same human

34:45.165 --> 34:50.112
tendency works in missions. And if a $300 or $400 
million mission was great, well, how about a $2

34:57.610 --> 35:00.535
billion, that one ought to be really fantastic. 
And of course, you reach some kind of law of

35:00.555 --> 35:11.654
diminishing returns where the increment in 
knowledge is not necessarily proportional to the

35:00.555 --> 35:11.654
increment in cost, to put it as delicately as 
possible. So that, coupled with the fact that I am

35:12.595 --> 35:22.993
virtually sure that people in the NASA hierarchy 
are rewarded by the size of their missions or the

35:23.648 --> 35:27.734
amount of the budget that they control. You have a 
built-in escalation mechanism. And I think we see

35:32.741 --> 35:34.904
that in everything that we do. And partly it's a 
technological advance. We know how to do things

35:37.868 --> 35:39.270
better. We don't want to do it the same way we did it 
15 or 20 years ago. And partially it's the tendency

35:43.196 --> 35:51.748
towards complexity and bureaucracy and all the 
other little nummies that we have come to love and

35:43.196 --> 35:51.748
know. Now let's go back to the late unpleasantness 
at the Yerkes Observatory. You may have been

35:57.638 --> 36:05.969
safely out of there, but I recall I spent a summer up 
there, and people like you and Ernie Heiser were

35:57.638 --> 36:05.969
telling people, don't come here to grad school. 
We're stuck here. We've got to finish it out. And

36:08.773 --> 36:13.720
that place was, as far as I know, famous for its 
infighting and everything. And eventually it got

36:14.307 --> 36:17.990
Quaker canned, is all I understand. Is that true? 
It's true to the best of my knowledge that there was

36:19.712 --> 36:25.717
a revolt and a no-confidence vote and all that kind 
of thing. As a student there, I don't remember it

36:26.618 --> 36:30.922
quite as bad. I mean, we knew the fighting was going 
on, but it didn't actually affect us all that much

36:30.942 --> 36:38.389
in retrospect. And I'm perfectly happy with the 
education that I got there. But there's no

36:43.957 --> 36:48.982
question it could get a little hairy. You left 
before Kuiper was ousted, right? No, Kuiper left

36:54.588 --> 37:00.334
between my third and fourth years there. Which 
would be? 1959.

37:04.638 --> 37:09.643
And that's when LPL was founded in Tucson. But when 
I left, Morgan was acting director. which was a fun

37:14.753 --> 37:16.695
thing in and of itself. But Corker had already 
gone. Actually, only a few people survived that

37:22.742 --> 37:27.848
three- or four-year period in there. Well, 
remember that when I first went there, Bengt

37:28.789 --> 37:33.775
Stromgren was director. And I don't know what 
happened to him. I don't know whether he was pushed

37:35.557 --> 37:37.038
or shoved. It doesn't matter. He said, fine, I'm 
going back to my professorship as Carlsberg

37:37.719 --> 37:43.005
professor at... at the observatory in Denmark, 
which I now cannot remember the name of. It's a

37:49.961 --> 37:51.163
famous observatory. Yeah, it's Copenhagen. 
Yeah, if any of us says the name, we'll know what it

37:51.943 --> 37:54.226
is. And I was told, don't have actual proof, but 
repeatedly told that the Carlsberg Brewery put

37:55.107 --> 38:05.137
major funding into there. Which, hey, we can 
handle that. And then Kuiper was director for a

38:06.359 --> 38:09.482
year or two. I don't know whether it was one or two. I 
don't know, I don't remember whether Strumden was

38:12.962 --> 38:17.668
one or two years in. Morgan was, I think, acting 
director the last year. I've heard from a number of

38:21.432 --> 38:27.339
people that there were a lot of people saying 
things like studying the solar system is a waste of

38:21.432 --> 38:27.339
time. We should be doing real astronomy. In 
fairness, not only did Joe Chamberlain do solar

38:31.725 --> 38:38.693
system work, but so did Kuiper.

38:40.006 --> 38:41.688
Kuiper was a hell of a smart man. People tend to 
forget that because his personality was a little

38:42.328 --> 38:45.452
rough. But he was very innovative. His studies of 
what we now call the Kuiper-Duncan belt were 30, 35

38:51.978 --> 39:00.807
years, 40 years ahead of their time, whatever the 
number is. And I think it's a tendency to

39:01.828 --> 39:09.456
underestimate his abilities and contributions, 
which I think is wrong. When did Aiden, do you

39:09.908 --> 39:12.873
remember when Aiden Minel left? That was, we had 
zero overlap at Yerkes, so I don't know when that

39:13.053 --> 39:17.941
was. And Joe Chamberlain? Joe Chamberlain was 
still at Yerkes when I left, and two years later,

39:19.824 --> 39:34.368
