00:08.063 --> 00:22.604
This is an interview with Sergeant First Class Lee 
Westbrook by Norah J. Garza on the 5th of December,

00:08.063 --> 00:22.604
1988, at his home and college station concerning 
the Vietnam War. Right.

00:26.950 --> 00:36.063
In the interest of accumulating knowledge about 
the war, I'm going to donate this tape to Texas A&M

00:26.950 --> 00:36.063
Oral History Collection in the University 
Archives. That'll go with you. That's fine. Okay.

00:40.916 --> 00:47.104
Let's start the questions with basic, your date 
and place of birth. I was born on March 11, 1941, in

00:47.124 --> 00:53.712
Southern Springs, Texas. My father was a 
seismographer with Magnolia Oil Company. He

00:57.777 --> 00:59.599
moved around a lot. We settled not too long after 
that in his former home of Gainesville, Texas,

00:59.699 --> 01:06.808
which is where I more or less grew up off and on. over 
the next 17 years. I've lived all over the United

01:09.671 --> 01:19.745
States prior

01:09.671 --> 01:19.745
to joining the Army. My dad moved around a lot. And 
when I was 17, I joined the Texas National Guard.

01:22.649 --> 01:26.775
And when I was 18, I joined the regular Army and I 
left. And except for a few visits,

01:26.795 --> 01:33.825
I haven't been back since. OK, which takes care of 
our next question. Any of your educational

01:36.353 --> 01:39.496
background? I quit high school and joined the 
Army. Two years later, I got a GED when I learned how

01:42.279 --> 01:45.082
to spell it. And in 1970, the Army sent me to the 
University of Southern California, and I are an

01:46.223 --> 01:54.811
aerospace safety engineer. So I've got some 
college background, and I have a course

01:56.773 --> 02:05.061
completion in aerospace safety engineering, 
which is accident investigation or anything

01:56.773 --> 02:05.061
else. Pretty much self-taught and everything 
else. And once I settled down and quit being a

02:10.208 --> 02:19.557
wild-eyed hell-raiser, I started to educate

02:10.208 --> 02:19.557
myself. I'd like to go through a brief sketch of 
your military career before being known. That's

02:26.683 --> 02:28.505
going to be hard to do because it wasn't brief. It 
was eight years long, and it had 22 different

02:28.605 --> 02:32.809
assignments in it. But I try to encapsulate it as 
much as I can. I originally enlisted in the regular

02:36.918 --> 02:41.884
army to be an MP. I started out in National Guard as a 
Browning automatic rifleman in the armored calf

02:41.964 --> 02:47.572
squadron. And I liked it, but I wanted to be an MP. I 
had some things wrong with one of my ankles. They

02:53.619 --> 02:55.061
were very strict in those days. I got busted out of 
the MP school and went to medical training. It was

02:59.787 --> 03:03.692
that or the infantry, and because of my ankle, they 
wouldn't let me go to the infantry. I tried. I tried

03:03.952 --> 03:04.713
to go airborne. They wouldn't let me go. So I became 
a medic, and that's pretty much what I did for the

03:06.145 --> 03:14.859
next eight years, that and trying to get out of the 
medical court. I didn't even actually work as a

03:14.879 --> 03:23.433
medic in a hospital on a ward until I'd been a medic 
for almost seven years. I did a tour in the Aleutian

03:23.453 --> 03:30.183
Islands where I didn't do my job, I did other jobs. 
And when I came back from that, I went to Fort Knox,

03:30.203 --> 03:32.507
Kentucky. assigned to a field hospital that was in 
reorganization. They had been in Chile during the

03:36.159 --> 03:42.829
1960 earthquakes down there, left all their 
equipment, most of the people were due to get out.

03:42.849 --> 03:46.073
When they came back, they got out and they 
reorganized and rebuilt the unit. I helped

03:46.093 --> 03:48.557
rebuild it. About six, eight months later, I 
reenlisted for a reassignment in West

03:48.577 --> 03:53.203
California. Spent nine months out there, was 
assigned to Germany. Came up on the levee. Spent

03:58.671 --> 04:02.697
three years in Munich, Germany, driving an 
ambulance all over southern Bavaria. Real tough

04:03.385 --> 04:05.868
job. Loved it every second of it. And I came back 
from Germany. I went back to the San Francisco Bay

04:09.993 --> 04:16.601
Area, and that's where, for the first time, I 
worked in a hospital on a ward. It was one of the two

04:17.222 --> 04:20.866
most rewarding experiences of my life. I worked 
with terror and quadriplegics. Quite a few of them

04:24.911 --> 04:30.237
at that time in 1965 were Vietnam veterans. We had 
76 patients on the ward, 56 of them were Vietnam

04:31.887 --> 04:37.696
veterans. And all of them were paralyzed to one 
extent or

04:37.716 --> 04:42.745
another. I was trying to go to Vietnam because it 
seemed like the thing to do. That's where the

04:46.371 --> 04:47.593
action was. I was a pro. And came up on levy for 
Germany again. But in the meantime, I had applied

04:55.125 --> 04:58.350
for helicopter flight school. and there was some 
difficulty with the paperwork. I got levied for

05:01.711 --> 05:03.734
Germany, had to reapply. I went back to Germany, 
and while I was there, I made staff sergeants and

05:04.976 --> 05:15.372
took over the battalion medical section. It was an 
aviation battalion, as it were. And I picked up a

05:18.537 --> 05:24.887
little bit of knowledge and information about 
helicopters and flying and some of the people

05:18.537 --> 05:24.887
there. And I hadn't been there quite a year when... 
I was accepted to flight school. I accepted the

05:31.968 --> 05:37.675
nomination to flight school and left 
immediately. I hadn't been home for Christmas

05:37.695 --> 05:39.257
since 1958. This was 1966. I made it home for 
Christmas by the skin of my teeth. So that was the

05:44.783 --> 05:48.888
first of a while. Nine months in flight school, 
which five months of it was at Fort Walters, Texas,

05:48.908 --> 05:57.919
best kept secret in the Army, and the remainder at 
Fort Rucker, Alabama, And then I showed up in

05:58.439 --> 06:06.588
Vietnam two days before Tet 68

05:58.439 --> 06:06.588
started. What else do you want to know besides 
that? That's very right. I've got a question for

06:12.555 --> 06:15.177
you. Were you married during this time before you 
went to Vietnam? Yes, I got married about two and a

06:18.561 --> 06:24.848
half years after I joined the Army. Still got the 
same wife. That's to her credit, not mine. She was a

06:31.487 --> 06:32.869
good lady. So you said you went to Vietnam? By the 
time I got to Vietnam, I'd been in the Army for

06:35.672 --> 06:43.119
almost

06:35.672 --> 06:43.119
10 years. Well, yeah, almost 10 years. Okay. My 
question was the fact that the Army tried to carry

06:46.283 --> 06:54.711
you, you know, like before Vietnam. Right. I made a 
few little notes here and wanted to refer to them.

07:09.238 --> 07:22.350
All my previous training and all my professional 
thought, as it were, and the thought processes

07:09.238 --> 07:22.350
that I developed were geared to fighting and 
winning in combat. By this stage in my career, my

07:22.370 --> 07:25.213
life, I'd pretty much settled down, and I was 
trying to act like a professional soldier. Took

07:31.370 --> 07:33.412
correspondence courses whenever I could. Any 
training that came along, if I could get into it,

07:34.413 --> 07:39.318
I'd get into it. Whatever I could to develop 
myself. I was fairly single-minded in my thoughts

07:42.641 --> 07:47.006
that I wanted to be the best that I could be. And 
doing this from a narrow field like I was, it's kind

07:48.747 --> 07:53.412
of hard to do. which is why I broke out and went in a 
helicopter, one of the reasons why. So my whole

07:58.213 --> 08:04.061
thought process was being a professional 
soldier. The preparation for me wasn't specific

08:04.081 --> 08:08.887
toward Vietnam. I don't think I ever saw any 
specific indoctrination, training, education,

08:08.907 --> 08:18.859
anything, on anything that was happening in South 
Vietnam. I knew some things about Southeast Asia.

08:22.215 --> 08:24.639
I had known for years about things. I was familiar 
with Ho Chi Minh's original purposes there with

08:24.679 --> 08:43.826
the Viet Minh running the French out in 1954, the 
Battle of Dien Bien Phu, the tenacity of the people

08:24.679 --> 08:43.826
to carry in on their backs the parts and pieces to 
105 howitzers, two-bar artillery. That's a big

08:43.846 --> 08:45.808
gun. And pack it in on their backs across mountains 
and devastate the so-called fortress that Demian

08:48.843 --> 08:53.787
put. The arrogance of the French to believe that it 
couldn't be done cost them their colonization. So

09:01.074 --> 09:02.155
I knew something about that. I knew a little bit 
about Orientals, just from what I picked up here

09:02.776 --> 09:05.818
and there. It was a mishmash of information, just 
little bits and pieces here and there that added up

09:06.459 --> 09:13.605
to a whole, which wasn't very much. I was no expert 
by any means. But having spent a lot of my life On the

09:18.863 --> 09:25.574
move, from one place to another, I learned how not 
to be an ugly American. I'd read the book, knew what

09:25.594 --> 09:30.722
it said, and tried not to do it. I wasn't your 
typical GI in Germany. Close, but no cigar. So when

09:36.171 --> 09:45.225
I got to Vietnam, I knew enough about it to begin to 
learn from that point on. But it was all on my own.

09:49.442 --> 09:54.467
The Army didn't

09:49.442 --> 09:54.467
prepare me for it at all. Okay, I guess we'll go 
through your first tour first. When you served it,

09:58.471 --> 10:08.640
where,

09:58.471 --> 10:08.640
how long? Okay. When I got there, just before Tet 68 
started, literally hours, I didn't know where I

10:08.780 --> 10:16.107
was going to be assigned. You went to the 
replacement depot, and you took what they gave

10:16.272 --> 10:21.377
you. They wanted bodies that could do this, that, 
or the other, and they put them in the vacancies

10:21.537 --> 10:29.706
that had been created by one reason or another. So I 
was assigned to the 17th Aviation Group, which was

10:29.886 --> 10:45.081
based in the train, and they further assigned me to 
the 52nd Combat Assault Battalion, which was

10:29.886 --> 10:45.081
based in Pleiku at the old French fort. Holloway 
Army Airfield was the name of it. They further

10:49.207 --> 10:57.638
assigned me to the 119th Assault Helicopter 
Company, which is where I stayed for about the

10:49.207 --> 10:57.638
first four months I was there. And then they came up 
with a thing called the D-Row Shuffle. It was a new

11:04.227 --> 11:12.739
unit in the battalion that was losing some of its 
old people, and they had to be replaced from within

11:04.227 --> 11:12.739
with other experienced people. By that time, I had 
a little dab of experience, and they sent me to the

11:13.327 --> 11:23.917
57th Assault Helicopter Company in Khantoum. 
Khantoum was located about 40 miles north and a

11:23.937 --> 11:36.349
little bit west of Pleiku, and it was right at the 
foot of one of the branches of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

11:36.369 --> 11:38.951
It was an outlet. Besides our unit, There was one 
engineer company there and a special forces camp

11:41.086 --> 11:47.272
there. And that was the extent of the American 
involvement in Khantoum. Shortly after I got

11:50.175 --> 11:53.438
there, the engineers left. And the special forces 
people were kind of aloof and standoffish to

11:53.458 --> 11:58.363
everybody. They had the locals convinced they had 
an underground armored division that was kept in

11:59.304 --> 12:05.490
secret. And if anybody ever did anything to them, 
they was going to turn them loose on the town and

12:05.590 --> 12:10.215
destroy it and kill everybody in it. The fools 
believed it, but they very seldom ever got in

12:10.482 --> 12:14.287
trouble. We used to get mortared and rocketed 
anywhere from three to five times a week, usually

12:14.367 --> 12:21.277
at two o'clock in the morning. It was fairly well 
predictable. So my duties there consisted of

12:23.821 --> 12:36.418
flying the missions in the mountains in support of 
elements of the 4th Infantry Division and that

12:23.821 --> 12:36.418
Special Forces camp. We worked mainly small unit 
tactics against regular north vietnamese units

12:39.507 --> 13:05.278
when and where we could find them and it was usually 
on the spur of the moment they would call a tactical

12:39.507 --> 13:05.278
emergency and we would three or four ships would 
meet someplace we would load up with troops get a

12:39.507 --> 13:05.278
quick briefing and join the assault we usually 
have a heavy gun team which consisted of three

12:39.507 --> 13:05.278
gunships as opposed to a gun team which is two 
gunships And we would go do what it was that we do,

13:06.828 --> 13:14.556
which is put the troops on the place where they need 
to be. Usually the side of a mountain or the top of

13:14.576 --> 13:19.521
it, rarely ever an open field. If we could get an 
area that was big enough to get three ships into,

13:19.541 --> 13:24.727
that was rare indeed. It was usually single ship 
landing zones or LZs. You went in one at a time by

13:29.051 --> 13:31.413
yourself. We had to be extremely careful because 
of these small landing zones. If we did anything

13:35.600 --> 13:43.171
stupid and cracked up the aircraft, we just 
plugged up the LZ, and then nobody could get in or

13:35.600 --> 13:43.171
out. So it got pretty hairy, and it required 
learning some skills that people said couldn't be

13:43.531 --> 13:51.242
done. Well, in the process, we rewrote the book 
about what you could do with helicopters in the

13:51.282 --> 13:55.348
mountains. We had good machines. We had good men. 
Primarily, though, it was small unit tactics

13:58.873 --> 14:04.240
against regular elements of the North Vietnamese 
Army. and specifically the 408th North

14:04.760 --> 14:15.051
Vietnamese Sapper Battalion, or regiment, which 
was located in and around the countryside all

14:04.760 --> 14:15.051
around us. We were completely

14:15.071 --> 14:19.075
surrounded by it. Did that for the remainder of my 
tour, working there in Special Forces operations

14:19.095 --> 14:28.605
across the fence in Laos and Cambodia. When LBJ 
said we weren't doing it, and we carried those

14:31.422 --> 14:39.751
people over there so they could do what it was that 
they do, which was spy, assassinate, and kidnap.

14:39.771 --> 14:56.130
We also resupplied their mountaintop radio relay 
stations and listening posts, kept those people

14:39.771 --> 14:56.130
out of trouble, fed, clothed, and rotated for R&R 
when they needed to, things like that. It had its

14:57.140 --> 14:58.743
moments of excitement. Most of the time it was 
fairly routine stuff, ash and trash, pigs and

14:58.783 --> 15:09.219
goats, chickens and oats, and just hauling stuff 
around and putting it off here and picking it up

14:58.783 --> 15:09.219
there. Fairly well mundane, really. The actual 
flying conditions were more treacherous than the

15:12.404 --> 15:20.978
combat conditions, except when the combat 
conditions really erupted. At that stage of the

15:20.998 --> 15:24.784
game, we had established our air superiority. And 
the bad guys had developed a fairly good respect

15:25.962 --> 15:36.175
for the fact that if they shot at one of our 
aircraft, we were going to hurt them. And we were

15:36.195 --> 15:38.418
going to spend millions of dollars doing it. We had 
the assets, we had the time, we had the place, and we

15:39.359 --> 15:45.127
had the motive. And they knew we would do it. And we 
did. So they didn't take idle shots at us. And

15:51.535 --> 15:53.978
usually when we did get shot at, it was... We were 
enjoying in some kind of a battle of some sort.

16:01.403 --> 16:03.885
That was pretty much what we did for the whole time 
there. It was like the old Siemens chant of hours

16:03.905 --> 16:13.075
and hours of boredom interspersed with moments of 
stark terror. And sometimes it got pretty scary.

16:16.178 --> 16:18.260
This was from January 68 to January 69? Right. 
Which time you came on home? I came home there.

16:23.776 --> 16:27.202
Okay.

16:27.222 --> 16:29.105
How did you feel about the war at this point? At that 
particular stage of the game? I mean, you'd been a

16:31.389 --> 16:37.140
veteran of the year and seen quite a bit, I'm sure. 
Well, I made a few notes on that to try to keep it down

16:37.841 --> 16:47.037
to a dull roar

16:37.841 --> 16:47.037
here. A guy once told me that And I'll never forget 
it. This is a dirty little war, but it's the only one

16:51.374 --> 16:55.559
we got. Well, a lot of us lifers looked at it that 
way. It was kind of a game more than anything else

16:59.423 --> 17:14.100
because it really didn't have drawn battle lines 
and, you know, General Rommel over there and

16:59.423 --> 17:14.100
whatever over there and pitched battles, tanks 
against tanks and so on. It wasn't that way. Most of

17:15.402 --> 17:18.285
the time it was just individuals against 
individuals. he was right it wasn't during the war

17:19.008 --> 17:41.826
but it was the only thing we had but we sort of 
accepted the fact that us lifers that people get

17:19.008 --> 17:41.826
killed in wars and some of them might even be 
friends so that didn't really have that much

17:19.008 --> 17:41.826
bearing on how i felt i don't really think that i had 
a broad enough vision in those days to see what was

17:19.008 --> 17:41.826
going on around me I know that there was a lot of 
frustration going on within myself. I saw a lot of

17:46.159 --> 17:50.744
things done for nothing, it would seem. Many times 
I saw us pay for the same real estate two and three

17:50.764 --> 17:54.928
times. I saw friends get killed doing this. It gets 
fairly ludicrous and it takes its toll on you no

17:59.512 --> 18:05.679
matter how motivated you are. It's fairly clear to 
me now. I really was on the horns of a dilemma and

18:08.722 --> 18:12.726
didn't recognize what it was all about. I was just 
so single-minded in my thinking. A strong part of

18:18.652 --> 18:22.436
my thinking was accomplish the mission, gung-ho, 
charge on. And another part of me, equally as

18:23.337 --> 18:26.860
strong, was saying, this is a crock. It's for 
nothing. We're really blowing. And each one of

18:34.147 --> 18:38.712
these conclusions was fighting for possession of 
them. And no matter which one of them won, I was

18:39.637 --> 18:45.086
going to be the ultimate loser. Well, I didn't 
realize that stuff in those days. One of the things

18:48.992 --> 18:57.946
I've come to learn since then is that confusion is 
the mother of fear, and fear is the controller of

18:48.992 --> 18:57.946
attitudes, and mine went in the toilet. Not that I 
didn't want to do it anymore or didn't care

18:57.966 --> 19:01.632
anything about doing it anymore. If that was true, 
I'd have quit. It went the other way. I developed an

19:08.037 --> 19:13.445
arrogance about me to hide my fear, which I was 
afraid of itself. I wasn't afraid to get killed or

19:13.665 --> 19:15.248
anything like that. I was afraid of being afraid. 
And I developed an arrogance that really got bad.

19:21.998 --> 19:24.301
And the worse it got, the worse it got. It became 
synergistic. It just fed on itself.

19:29.169 --> 19:36.660
By the time I got back for my second tour,

19:29.169 --> 19:36.660
I thought I had it figured out. If I could just go 
back and do my job better this time, we'd win. And I

19:46.066 --> 19:47.508
didn't know I was putting the blame on me. I had no 
idea, none whatsoever.

19:53.656 --> 19:56.599
But for the time being, it was what had to be done. I 
was a soldier, professional. This was my chosen

20:00.064 --> 20:02.547
way of life, and I was going to do it. Like the man 
said, it was a dirty, nasty little war, which only

20:04.079 --> 20:11.388
we

20:04.079 --> 20:11.388
had. Okay. You said you went back for a second tour. 
Let me change this a bit. Was the decision to return

20:20.980 --> 20:23.103
to Vietnam yours? No, not at all. It was a given. If 
you were a lifer, especially a helicopter pilot,

20:25.606 --> 20:29.932
the second tour was an automatic. Some people even 
got a third tour. depending on how early they

20:32.024 --> 20:36.591
started, and I kind of hit it just at the right time. 
And that's, you know, it's not to say that I did or

20:37.592 --> 20:42.239
did not volunteer for it. It was just something 
that was going to happen. I spent my year and a half

20:45.003 --> 20:53.857
or so at home as a flight instructor out in Texas 
waiting for it to happen. And that, too, was a bad

20:53.877 --> 20:59.365
thing because I never did relax because I knew I was 
going back. And I knew that I could not afford to

21:00.644 --> 21:08.676
slack off in my thinking, my awareness of what was 
going on around me. I developed a sense of

21:08.737 --> 21:16.649
awareness from those days that, looking back on it 
now, boggles my mind. I became, through this fear

21:16.669 --> 21:28.407
thing, absolutely aware of absolutely 
everything going on around me and had the ability

21:16.669 --> 21:28.407
to take in a fact, analyze it, and discard it if it 
wasn't going to kill me. And that's exactly the way

21:29.821 --> 21:31.363
I look at everything. If it wasn't going to kill me, 
it didn't matter. Ain't about nothing. This is a

21:35.567 --> 21:36.869
famous expression from Vietnam. Don't mean

21:37.610 --> 21:41.494
a thing. I never relaxed. I was still in Vietnam 
even though I was at home. Because I knew when I went

21:46.239 --> 21:52.226
back, I could not afford to have to develop these 
senses all over again. Because I would be expected

21:52.246 --> 21:56.791
to pick up right where I left off. And I didn't have 
the sense enough to learn how to relax So it wasn't

22:01.580 --> 22:05.326
really a matter of me volunteering or they sending 
me. It was just that was the next step. I don't think

22:08.992 --> 22:10.975
I would have chosen either way. I just sat and 
waited. And when the orders came, I packed up and

22:15.522 --> 22:19.349
went. And I left two baby daughters behind me. 
They're grown

22:22.333 --> 22:27.982
now. Okay. I was wondering if you could briefly 
describe your duties on the second tour. Medevac.

22:36.922 --> 22:47.732
I got assigned to the original dust-off 
detachment,

22:36.922 --> 22:47.732
57th Med Detachment of Ambulance Helicopter. 
Yeah, that's how it goes. And they were the

22:48.273 --> 22:53.538
original dust-off unit that was started back in, I 
think, 1966. Dust-off is an acronym, but for the

22:54.439 --> 22:57.943
life of me, I can't remember what it means anymore. 
Maybe it's Somebody you talk to one day is going to

22:58.617 --> 23:04.122
remember that they've got a big convention coming 
up next weekend down in San Antonio. But I'm not

23:05.303 --> 23:09.166
going. Primarily in 1971, we were involved in the 
medical evacuation of Arvids. There were very few

23:17.073 --> 23:24.280
U.S. left in the Delta where I was assigned near 
Canto. Elements of the 9th Infantry Division,

23:24.300 --> 23:26.802
some Navy, few aircraft outfits, one cab 
squadron, air cab squadron, and they pretty much

23:27.355 --> 23:33.381
took care of their own folks. But I was based there 
at Ben Tuohy at the Third Surge Hospital. It was a

23:39.768 --> 23:40.769
MASH hospital. I lived there, and the base was 
across the street at the Navy Airfield. And that

23:46.515 --> 23:50.579
was primarily what we did, was picked up the little 
people and brought them in. Most of the missions

23:50.739 --> 23:53.282
were at night. Very few of them in the daytime. And 
we covered an area of 12,000 square miles.

24:01.217 --> 24:12.675
I learned some very hard lessons from some of those 
night evacuations about people, especially the

24:01.217 --> 24:12.675
originals. I knew some things about them, but I had 
no idea until I did that tour. But mainly it was just

24:19.645 --> 24:22.590
picking up the wounded, taking them to a hospital 
sometimes.

24:26.063 --> 24:30.728
Okay.

24:30.748 --> 24:33.110
You were saying that you learned some very hard 
lessons. Would you like to relate any experiences

24:33.691 --> 24:46.804
that you feel, I'm sure the war as a whole did make a 
lasting impression on your life, that something

24:33.691 --> 24:46.804
that you feel just stood out? Oh, several things 
that

24:46.824 --> 24:52.510
stood out. I don't tell war stories. I just don't do 
it. But this one, I'm going to relate one incident.

25:00.557 --> 25:02.258
It was deep night. We were called way out somewhere 
to pick up this one Arvin that had been severely

25:03.419 --> 25:10.085
wounded. He'd been shot by one of his fellows is 
what had happened. And he was fragged. Yeah, threw

25:15.731 --> 25:16.932
a hand grenade at him. Something about a 
girlfriend and requited love and all that stuff.

25:21.276 --> 25:22.817
But anyhow, we went out and picked the guy up. And 
the medic we had on board was a kid named Randy Hill.

25:26.780 --> 25:29.403
And he was from Tyler, Texas. And he was 19 years old 
and did amazing feats of saving people's lives.

25:36.071 --> 25:41.518
His ability and his skill and knowledge was just 
beyond my comprehension. I don't know how he did

25:41.538 --> 25:42.840
it, but he did. Well, he kept the guy alive, had IVs, 
intravenous injections, plugged into him just

25:44.322 --> 25:49.969
about everywhere he could. Our control told us to 
take this chap to the pad at Mito. Well, this

25:59.130 --> 26:02.656
particular pad is a very nasty one. And Mito is a 
very nasty little village. And it has some bad guys

26:05.881 --> 26:08.204
in it. And we don't like to go there at night, but we 
had to go. We called them way out, 20 minutes out,

26:12.511 --> 26:16.497
that we were coming in. And we talked to the 
American advisor there, and he assured us that an

26:17.388 --> 26:26.498
ambulance would be standing by there at the pad 
next to the canal when we got in there. And they

26:26.518 --> 26:32.644
would quick time get him off the ship so we could get 
out of there before somebody had a chance to draw a

26:26.518 --> 26:32.644
beat on us. And about 10 minutes out, we called them 
back, confirmed that, yeah, they were trying to

26:34.866 --> 26:40.352
get that ambulance rounded up now. And five 
minutes out, we called in, and they said, yeah, the

26:41.393 --> 26:46.078
ambulance is on its way to the pad. And two minutes 
out, we called them and told them we were landing.

26:52.781 --> 26:54.664
And when we got to the pad, no one was there. We're 
sitting there, a great big 9,500-pound

26:56.767 --> 27:04.037
helicopter making a tremendous amount of noise 
with lights on. We turned the lights off. Nothing

27:04.979 --> 27:06.020
really did any good. All you had to do was aim at the 
noise. And we called them and said, where's the

27:08.624 --> 27:10.727
ambulance? They said, it's on its way. This guy's 
laying in the back, bleeding to death. Randy's

27:16.856 --> 27:17.938
keeping him alive. We call again a minute later and 
told them we've got to leave. We'd already been

27:23.554 --> 27:26.197
sitting on the ground for over 60 seconds. That's 
sticking it so far out in the street, it's

27:26.257 --> 27:31.042
pathetic. We just didn't do that. They implored us 
to stay a little bit longer, so we waited another

27:33.604 --> 27:37.648
minute. And we had outlived our existence by then. 
So they told us to set the guy off. The ambulance

27:43.013 --> 27:47.358
would be there any second and get on out of there. So 
we did. We came back about three hours later, still

27:49.424 --> 27:55.733
in the middle of the night, with another one. And 
the same guy was still laying there, dead or alive.

28:03.584 --> 28:04.084
They never picked him up. The Americans couldn't. 
The Vietnamese wouldn't.

28:09.932 --> 28:16.341
I knew for years that Orientals viewed life and 
death a lot differently than Occidentals did. And

28:16.361 --> 28:17.743
I learned a thing or two about that. It puts things 
into perspective. But I never conceived that it

28:22.246 --> 28:34.839
was like that, that they would let their fellow lay 
there and bleed to death because they were too

28:22.246 --> 28:34.839
scared of driving in and standing and picking up.

28:34.859 --> 28:35.700
I've never forgotten anything.

28:39.004 --> 28:47.292
There's not much I wouldn't do at this stage of the 
game, or at least I like to think so, that if someone

28:39.004 --> 28:47.292
needed something, needed help, I don't know where 
I would place limits on trying to do it. I don't

28:52.357 --> 28:53.018
think I would. Anything within my power to do, I 
would do. Regardless of risk. Regardless of cost.

29:01.709 --> 29:03.071
I've done it a few times. Some of them are pretty 
stupid things to do, but I've done it. So I don't

29:06.415 --> 29:08.859
have any doubt about that, whether or not I would. 
It's just when. The single question in my mind is

29:13.585 --> 29:16.789
when's the next time? That made a lasting 
impression on me. They wanted everything from us,

29:19.621 --> 29:27.389
but they weren't willing to give anything, even

29:19.621 --> 29:27.389
from themselves. That,

29:27.450 --> 29:32.015
I've never gotten rid of. Next question. I kind of 
missed a question here. Your second tour, you were

29:34.077 --> 29:42.086
there from... Oh, from, let's see here. April 1971 
to March 1972. I left a month earlier. On the

29:49.186 --> 29:52.591
stretcher. Almost made it. Two years without

29:54.373 --> 29:58.719
a scratch, all of it. What kind of wound did you... I 
broke my kneecap.

30:04.206 --> 30:05.969
Oh, nothing spectacular or heroic. I got drunk and 
fell down the stairs.

30:10.535 --> 30:12.257
Okay, um... One of my other questions was what kind 
of reception you received when you did come home on

30:13.925 --> 30:25.599
either tour, if they were any different, because 
they were very different stages of the war. Very

30:26.119 --> 30:29.884
good question, too, and easy to answer. When I came 
back from the first tour, I got a really little

30:29.984 --> 30:36.752
incident that happened before I came back from the 
first tour. I came back before I was supposed to

30:37.473 --> 30:41.478
come back. In August 1967, I went on R&R to Hawaii, I 
was originally scheduled to go to Hong Kong, and at

30:43.962 --> 30:55.797
the very last minute, I mean literally within 
hours of it, I changed and went to Hawaii because it

30:43.962 --> 30:55.797
was my oldest daughter's birthday. She had 
written a letter and said, I wish my daddy could

30:55.817 --> 31:00.463
come home for his birthday. How can you turn that 
down? So I got a guy to swap with me, and I went to

31:02.626 --> 31:07.652
Hawaii, and they told us, don't go back to Kaunas, 
the United States. No, you've been bad. You stink.

31:09.835 --> 31:10.435
Stay out of there. They don't want you there. Can't 
leave Hawaii. And we all said bye, and then we all

31:13.375 --> 31:17.501
took off to the airport. Well, I had to lay over in 
LAX, or Los Angeles International Airport, about

31:17.521 --> 31:25.832
2 o'clock in the morning. And I was in uniform with 
my wings and a few little ribbons that I possessed

31:25.852 --> 31:32.481
at that time. The six-pack they give you for 
showing up were three-packs. And I was standing at

31:37.928 --> 31:41.031
a kind of a stand-up hot dog stand. A couple of 
maintenance guys were there, and this old

31:41.051 --> 31:46.878
gentleman that ran it was there. And we were just 
shooting the breeze, and it wasn't even about the

31:46.918 --> 31:51.803
war. And they were very polite not to say anything 
to me. And we could hear this group and smell this

31:57.729 --> 32:01.573
group coming before we ever saw them. There was 
about four or five of the scraggliest-looking

32:01.593 --> 32:05.978
hippies you ever saw in your life. And they saw me, 
and they saw those silver wings, which to them

32:07.240 --> 32:17.473
equated to napalm and baby killing.

32:17.493 --> 32:20.157
And they immediately zeroed in on me. And they was 
all kinds of things, which I'm not going to repeat.

32:24.562 --> 32:27.867
And accusing me of every vile crime in the world. 
And these guys that were with me there, just

32:28.848 --> 32:35.016
standing there shooting the breeze, wanted to run 
them off. And I said, no, wait a minute, I'm going to

32:35.036 --> 32:36.538
show you something. I was having a good time. And I 
stood there and I took it, nodded my head, okay,

32:40.691 --> 32:45.663
okay, anything else? And finally they just flat 
ran out of steam. They were yelling and hollering.

32:50.614 --> 32:53.280
It's a wonder the police didn't show up, all the 
noise they were making. And I just stood there and

32:53.300 --> 32:54.122
took it. And I said, you know, folks, everything 
you said is absolutely true. Furthermore, did you

32:59.600 --> 33:15.823
know, and I started making up some of the 
god-awfulest macabre stories that the mind can

32:59.600 --> 33:15.823
conceive, and one of them became physically ill, 
and some of the descriptions that I was giving of

32:59.600 --> 33:15.823
what we did, which we never did, Two others just 
turned around and ran because they thought I was

33:17.525 --> 33:21.071
fixing to go berserk. I get pretty wild-eyed 
sometimes, and I have green eyes, and they

33:21.131 --> 33:25.257
sparkle. They light up, literally. They look 
really weird, I've been told. And I really had a

33:29.864 --> 33:32.248
blast at it. They all kind of was backing away. They 
didn't know whether I was going to pounce on them or

33:34.412 --> 33:38.077
what, and I was just trying to tell them. I said, 
wait, come back. There's more. There's more. You

33:40.621 --> 33:42.925
know, trying to really be their friend and all this 
stuff. These guys just cracked up over it. That was

33:45.150 --> 33:50.377
the only incident I ever ran into at that stage in 
the game, and I had a ball with it. Absolute blast.

33:52.379 --> 33:59.528
When I got home in January of 69, I have two rather 
wealthy uncles. Well, one now. They live in

34:00.970 --> 34:05.175
Dallas, and they wanted to take me out of the town in 
uniform. That was the proviso. So my wife and I, we

34:07.441 --> 34:10.845
got gussied up a little bit, and off we went. And 
they took us to a real fancy joint where we stood in

34:10.885 --> 34:14.288
line for two hours to eat. Well, I had gotten used to 
consuming copious amounts of scotch in those

34:15.470 --> 34:22.177
days, and these guys didn't know how to do that. By 
the time we got to eat, they were fairly well gone,

34:24.640 --> 34:27.943
and I was just getting started.

34:30.886 --> 34:33.729
There was no one said anything against me. No one 
said anything to me either in the place. I don't

34:37.175 --> 34:41.359
believe, I don't recall, but I know that it wasn't 
anything negative as such. I noticed people

34:42.400 --> 34:51.028
looking at me, and they would look away when I 
caught their eye, but no one ever said or did

34:42.400 --> 34:51.028
anything. The whole time that I was home, 1969 to 
71,

34:51.048 --> 35:00.097
I was insulated and isolated from the rest of the 
world. I was in Mineral Wells, Texas, in Fort

35:00.858 --> 35:06.523
Walters, a place that was very pro-army, 
pro-aviation, We didn't have any hassles around

35:07.820 --> 35:09.642
there. The locals wouldn't stand for it. And the 
rest of the world didn't know we was there. It

35:16.129 --> 35:21.115
wasn't one of your big bases like Fort Benning or 
Fort Knox where people knew where it was. This was a

35:21.175 --> 35:25.880
little bitty place out on the edge of West Texas and 
no one knew it existed. It was a great place. Still

35:26.861 --> 35:27.221
is. It's, for always, will be my home.

35:32.896 --> 35:35.018
So I didn't get around all this stuff. I watched the 
news and saw all the things that were going on, but I

35:35.038 --> 35:39.663
never got exposed to it personally. When I went 
back to Vietnam in 1971, I knew about things

35:41.665 --> 35:50.853
happening, but I didn't know about them. I wasn't 
educated about them. I didn't want to be educated

35:53.036 --> 35:54.697
about them. If I had my job, I was going to do it. This 
was my job. This is what I did. And when I came back in

35:59.542 --> 36:02.785
72, That was different. Enormously so. I was 
medevaced back with a busted knee and spent some

36:08.935 --> 36:15.765
time in the hospital. Spent some time on 
convalescent leave and was reassigned to Fort

36:15.785 --> 36:20.552
Hood, Texas. Well, I decided to try to get away from 
the military for a while, at least see how the other

36:20.572 --> 36:25.298
half lived. That was a mistake on my part. I bought a 
house in Waco, 70 miles away. Commuted every day,

36:31.648 --> 36:33.210
140 miles a day. And my neighbors put me through the 
mill. I had one neighbor that would actually talk

36:39.045 --> 36:42.371
to me. Nice old chap. He didn't much care for the 
rest of them. And he was the only one. The rest of

36:47.981 --> 36:52.929
them, some of them wouldn't even let their kids 
play with mine when they found out who I was. I left

36:54.612 --> 36:57.898
so early in the morning they never saw me, but when I 
came home in the evening, they did. And there was no

36:58.739 --> 37:00.721
mistake in that flight suit. Plus, it had the 
forehead stickers all over the car. It was

37:03.283 --> 37:06.326
required. And it didn't take long for the word to 
get around the neighborhood. This guy's a Vietnam

37:09.750 --> 37:10.871
vet. Those people would see me coming, would turn 
around and go back in their house. That hurt. It

37:17.637 --> 37:20.861
really did. I got to where I did not tell people what 
I did for a living.

37:26.546 --> 37:27.447
And as soon as I did, instant turn off. When I got out 
in 1973, for about a year, I did other things and

37:30.856 --> 37:36.965
then I went back to flying. I was in Fort Rucker, 
Alabama as a civilian flight instructor for the

37:38.507 --> 37:44.095
Army. And even around there, when you get away from 
the military complex itself, I didn't tell people

37:44.115 --> 37:53.409
what I did for a living. In 1977, I went to work for an 
offshore flying service in the Gulf of Mexico. And

38:02.590 --> 38:04.052
I bought a house up north of Dallas. And I had 
learned by that stage of the game not to tell people

38:05.293 --> 38:11.181
that I flew helicopters for a living. And for a year 
and a half, none of my neighbors knew what I did.

38:14.706 --> 38:18.531
They only knew that I was home a week and gone a week. 
And one day, a chap that lived on one side of me, who I

38:18.551 --> 38:27.302
had shared many a beer over the fence with, 
chit-chatted about his Capri and my old Chevrolet

38:27.552 --> 38:30.755
truck and talked this, that, and the other. We're 
fairly good acquaintances. We weren't hard and

38:32.877 --> 38:37.321
fast friends, but we were comfortable with each 
other. One day his curiosity got the best of him.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.365
And he asked me, he said, say, what do you do? I said, 
what do you mean? He said, well, you're here a week,

38:44.067 --> 38:45.669
you're gone a week. You travel and sail, you don't 
look like one. I thought about it for a second. I

38:50.933 --> 38:51.714
said, why not? Let's try it. And I told him what I 
did, that I flew helicopters offshore in the Gulf

38:53.416 --> 38:57.019
of Mexico in support of the offshore drilling 
industry. And he looked at me and he said, one

39:00.824 --> 39:07.733
question.

39:07.753 --> 39:10.076
Were you a pilot in Vietnam? I said, yes. The man 
never spoke to me again. He was a young fellow,

39:14.743 --> 39:18.688
younger than I was. I'd come out in the backyard, 
he'd go in the house. And I endured that for 16

39:22.834 --> 39:25.337
years. Never quieted. The guy on the other side of 
the house from me was a retired Navy. One day he

39:32.267 --> 39:35.752
asked me what I did for a living. And I just told him 
right straight out, and I said, and if you don't

39:35.772 --> 39:39.298
like it, pal, you can go to hell. He said, I think 
it's great. I was there, too. The only one in the

39:43.204 --> 39:47.050
whole neighborhood, the two that knew what I did. 
And pretty soon, it got all over the neighborhood

39:48.252 --> 39:54.883
that I was a Vietnam veteran helicopter pilot, a 
baby killer that dropped napalm on me. Never

39:56.332 --> 39:57.153
killed anybody. Never killed anybody that I know 
of. It certainly didn't drop any napalm. So there

40:04.002 --> 40:08.869
was a marked difference between the two 
homecomings, as it were. And it steadily

40:08.889 --> 40:12.073
progressed from 1973 until 1984. Things changed. 
Things happened.

40:19.683 --> 40:22.027
But it did get worse and worse and worse as it went 
along. I read an article one time that a guy said

40:23.188 --> 40:26.052
that We're taking our guilt out on the Vietnam 
veterans for what we allowed to go on unchecked.

40:37.189 --> 40:41.596
And I think that made more sense than anything 
else. The enormity of it is too much to avenge. So I

40:46.384 --> 40:51.732
forgive

40:46.384 --> 40:51.732
them. It's easier. Does that answer your 
question? Very well. Good. Going back to you, you

40:58.381 --> 41:02.665
said you did work with the Arvin on your second 
tour. I've got a few questions, you know, relating

41:02.985 --> 41:09.191
to the people and the culture of South Vietnam. I 
was wondering if you could, you know, briefly

41:09.211 --> 41:27.848
relate your view of the people, you know, how you 
felt, well, you have, but just to sum it up, your

41:09.211 --> 41:27.848
view of when you first got there, how it changed, 
you know, during, after the war, today, you know.

41:28.655 --> 41:31.198
When I got there, they didn't change. I did. 
They're stoic. They've been that way for

41:33.501 --> 41:35.104
thousands of years. Vietnam has always been 
unsettled. My youngest daughter gave me a book on

41:39.209 --> 41:41.172
Vietnam. It's in the other room. I think she bought 
it by the weight rather than the content. It's

41:48.662 --> 41:54.209
about three inches thick, and it's the complete 
history of Vietnam for 4,000 years that was

41:48.662 --> 41:54.209
recorded. And they had a recorded history 4,000 
years long. And it's been constant turmoil. Well,

41:59.923 --> 42:03.229
when I got there, the people are simple people. 
Very simple. They're peasants. They want a little

42:05.732 --> 42:07.315
piece of dirt. They want to grow their food and live 
their life and raise their kids so that they can

42:07.335 --> 42:16.088
grow their food and live their life and raise their 
kids. Very simple. They're not all that

42:16.829 --> 42:18.532
ambitious. The colonization by the French and the 
European influence on many of the families and

42:18.612 --> 42:27.045
dynasties in Vietnam or what creates most of the 
turmoil. The educated ones, they become

42:30.822 --> 42:33.005
ambitious. There's nothing wrong with ambition.

42:38.394 --> 42:42.080
Like what Mark Anthony said about it. It's noble. 
Nobody's going to let it go to your head. But the

42:47.749 --> 42:49.432
simple people are just that. They're simple

42:49.452 --> 42:53.258
people. At the time, Again, I have to emphasize, my 
vision was narrow. I was a wiper GI all the way. I

43:03.168 --> 43:04.530
didn't care about nothing but Army. Didn't know 
anything but Army. Didn't want to know anything

43:05.872 --> 43:07.334
but Army. Soldier. That was me. All the way 
through. With what I did. And I tried to do it well.

43:15.685 --> 43:20.832
But I saw these people just like any other people. 
Except they didn't care what happened. Because of

43:25.261 --> 43:28.125
the oriental mindset, what's going to happen is 
going to happen. There's nothing you're going to

43:28.145 --> 43:30.629
do about it. In some factions, they call it karma. I 
don't know what they call it in others, but that's a

43:33.313 --> 43:37.620
pretty good handle on it. It's going to happen. 
It's going to happen. We have very little

43:40.905 --> 43:46.794
influence over our destiny, is what they believe. 
And they accepted things like that. Yeah, they

43:49.077 --> 43:51.762
would mourn the dead and then go back to work. We do 
the same thing. We did exactly the same thing. We

43:55.923 --> 43:59.587
buried my grandmother in 1976 or whenever it was. 
We mourned that morning and partied that

44:00.969 --> 44:02.951
afternoon. The uncle that was crying the most was 
partying the hardest. So we're no different in

44:09.700 --> 44:11.562
that respect. But the one thing I saw was that 
disturbed me and turned me against them was that

44:21.505 --> 44:23.487
And I believe we were there righteously. That's 
where I went wrong. But we were trying to provide a

44:27.151 --> 44:32.316
service for them, and they didn't care whether 
they got it or not. And I think that's where the Viet

44:32.336 --> 44:36.239
Minh and the VC had it over. They found people who 
had been put down by the colonialism and by the

44:36.279 --> 44:50.213
ambitious rich that were taking over the running 
of the country. literally raping it of its

44:50.564 --> 44:55.089
profits.

44:55.109 --> 44:56.230
These people have been hurt by it. The V.C. told 
them the truth, that they lived under a corrupt

44:57.511 --> 45:02.376
government, which was true. There's no doubt 
about it. We know that now. And a lot of people who

45:06.080 --> 45:10.925
knew it then tried to tell us, but we wouldn't 
listen. They showed them the truth and convinced

45:10.945 --> 45:17.332
them that they were a better answer. And all we did 
was go in with bigger and noisier things We didn't

45:21.496 --> 45:26.122
appeal to their spirit at all. And they could see 
through our greed like a clear glass. It was easy to

45:31.830 --> 45:38.559
see.

45:38.579 --> 45:39.680
I didn't know that then. All I could see at that time 
was these people didn't care whether I died

45:41.503 --> 45:47.210
fighting for them or not. And I don't like that. I 
like to be appreciated a little bit. That's the

45:52.288 --> 45:56.393
fallacy of the European people. So I began to hate 
them. The Arvin was a lousy excuse for an army that

45:59.556 --> 46:07.684
there ever

45:59.556 --> 46:07.684
was. The harder it got, the worse he got. Some units 
and some individuals were great. There were two

46:12.749 --> 46:18.975
people that I knew that were fantastic, Colonel 
Lynn in canton and Captain Coy on my second tour. He

46:19.850 --> 46:20.551
was a patriot. He loved his country. I don't know 
whether he got out or not. I like to think he stole a

46:26.178 --> 46:32.065
helicopter, loaded his family up, and flew that 
thing out to an aircraft carrier and dumped it in

46:26.178 --> 46:32.065
the sea with the rest of them. But I don't know. 
Colonel Lynn was a fine man. He was a good leader,

46:34.969 --> 46:37.953
and he was a patriot. I don't know what happened to 
him. His own people killed him. That was after I

46:42.658 --> 46:45.742
left, thank God, because I would have gone berserk 
over that. I really liked it. I've only said that

46:48.031 --> 46:50.894
about three colonels in my entire life. The other 
two were both Americans. But as groups, they're

46:56.200 --> 46:58.182
lousy. As individuals, some of them are pretty 
good. The elite units, the Rangers, were fairly

47:01.226 --> 47:08.734
good, but they let that go to their heads and became 
more like Gestapo than anything else. They say, I

47:10.075 --> 47:15.681
am the toughest, the meanest, and you give me all 
your chickens and your prettiest daughter, and

47:10.075 --> 47:15.681
I'm going to take them. And they would. So they were 
no better than the bad guys. It was hard to tell who

47:20.879 --> 47:24.568
the good guy was and who the bad guy was. I got fired 
on many, many times from Arvin units that were full

47:24.588 --> 47:30.441
of VC or NBA sympathizers.

47:46.537 --> 47:47.283
Want something to drink?
