WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:18.675
I guess a couple of the people that had as much 
influence on my life would have been probably Bill

00:03.440 --> 00:18.675
Amings, who ended up dying at a very early age, but 
an outstanding patrol missionary. What was

00:18.695 --> 00:22.118
outstanding about him? He cared about

00:22.138 --> 00:30.126
people.

00:30.146 --> 00:32.248
And even though he was tough and everything, you 
know, being there with them, chop in one hand and

00:32.954 --> 00:37.420
butcher in the other. And it sometimes didn't be 
there way before we get there and have a whole board

00:37.581 --> 00:43.008
just cut. And at that point in time, in petroleum 
engineering, they really didn't have that many

00:43.028 --> 00:52.282
good textbooks. And that resolved most of what 
they gave George through handouts and so forth and

00:52.302 --> 00:59.011
what they put on the blackboard. And the other one 
was, of course, Bob White. And he's still there.

01:03.194 --> 01:04.276
Describe him. He was a completely different type 
of person. And I think he probably got a lot of ideas

01:13.851 --> 01:27.092
maybe from Harold Vance who was head of the 
department before Fred Stevens and then Bob

01:13.851 --> 01:27.092
White. It just kind of hit the flame. I was kind of 
like an old miner. I was just thinking, oh, I'll

01:38.119 --> 01:41.384
just drill another foot and hit the mother load 
down there. That miner's

01:43.067 --> 01:50.179
going to chip another six inches and he's going to 
rip the mother load. I think guiding, guiding. I

01:52.418 --> 02:09.858
was into

01:52.418 --> 02:09.858
direction, which we might take. At one time, I 
thought probably I was going to retire, major oil

02:09.878 --> 02:14.723
company, engineer, vice president, or 
something. But after having been around him

02:14.743 --> 02:20.029
enough, I finally realized that the only way you 
really want to do it is to get out and do it on your

02:14.743 --> 02:20.029
own. All right, let's go to some other, what

02:21.680 --> 02:40.026
about any important

02:21.680 --> 02:40.026
people that In chemistry, physics? Well, I had a 
real interest in them. There were several

02:47.315 --> 02:50.943
interesting professors. I think it's always fun 
to talk about them. Like Muggles Harder. No, no,

02:54.912 --> 02:56.215
no, no. It's Texas A&M. Texas A&M. Snuggs. Oh yes, 
please share it with us. Every time you come in with

03:03.338 --> 03:10.248
a grin, you hear, hello, thank you, thank you, you 
know, this, that, that. You're just all so

03:10.268 --> 03:14.093
enthusiastic. And then I guess you're 
physically, that one's a quantity, but I believe

03:14.113 --> 03:22.205
in physical chemistry, I think it's a little bit 
harder. Oh gosh, you just never understand

03:22.225 --> 03:27.152
what's going on. Maybe in a dirty shirt and else. 
probably

03:28.893 --> 03:32.897
hurt again. Now why was his shirt dirty? I had no 
idea, but he just had that nickname. It wasn't that

03:38.984 --> 03:40.065
dirty. He did it for some reason. Did you ever have 
chemistry with John Beckham? No. Because I think

03:45.971 --> 03:47.893
his nickname was Foghorn. He had a very strong 
voice. Let's see, math?

03:55.387 --> 04:24.988
I didn't have

03:55.387 --> 04:24.988
the same type of feelings towards English as I did 
the other day. Although I did find that it

04:25.610 --> 04:43.940
just looked up. In other faculty, other 
disciplines that you can talk about? I can't

04:45.183 --> 04:46.304
remember the guy that taught us. I think it was a 
book on the story of mankind, I believe. And you

04:51.698 --> 04:54.923
didn't take any history, probably. State law 
would be changed right after you graduated,

04:54.943 --> 04:58.549
requiring six. I

04:59.050 --> 05:04.819
took one for history and government. And that was 
the only one I couldn't work in, so I had to do it by

05:04.839 --> 05:10.589
correspondence with the dressing room. Let's 
see, were there any, did you ever have any

05:10.669 --> 05:15.597
interaction with John Calhoun? Was he?

05:19.036 --> 05:21.419
I got there after. I read the 55. So he was there. Oh, 
I'd love to. I'd love to. Still as bright as can be.

05:30.108 --> 05:31.349
Still on the campus every day. His book is one of the 
best reservoir books in the world. He's just got

05:35.994 --> 05:41.320
the worst table of contents and index. Were there 
any counselor, advisors that perhaps in the core,

05:41.340 --> 05:48.908
MSC? Student life, housing? Well,

05:52.095 --> 06:08.272
the reason I guess I'm here is because I'm a law 
student, and I've always been involved in

05:52.095 --> 06:08.272
politics, even though I did not run for an office or 
anything like that. Since out of here, as a

06:08.292 --> 06:19.063
freshman, I was a class president with President 
Clayton, and was a student senator as a result of

06:08.292 --> 06:19.063
that. I had

06:19.837 --> 06:38.616
to be around

06:19.837 --> 06:38.616
a lot of people

06:19.837 --> 06:38.616
the freshman year that I probably wouldn't have if 
I hadn't been elected to it. So I was around Wally

06:38.636 --> 06:39.177
Moon. Wally Moon was the coach of the freshman 
baseball team. I grew up in

06:40.880 --> 06:58.579
a baseball

06:40.880 --> 06:58.579
field, and on my way down there, I thought that I 
could probably just walk up, you know, and see the

06:40.880 --> 06:58.579
best player going. One of the last couple of guys 
that was cut, but after about six or seven or eight

06:58.599 --> 07:03.945
games, I ended up being cut off the team. And I 
attribute that to my classmate, Joe Hargrove. He

07:06.091 --> 07:20.085
didn't

07:06.091 --> 07:20.085
lose a game in his senior year. He was like 16 or 
17-0. He had a curve like he couldn't win. pitching

07:22.612 --> 07:33.585
from the left hand side. I haven't seen

07:33.605 --> 07:40.994
a curve like that. But anyway, I enjoyed the 
baseball experience, the student senate, and all

07:41.014 --> 07:44.698
of those types of things. As a junior, I learned a 
handful. on

07:45.764 --> 08:04.124
students

07:45.764 --> 08:04.124
any time, when elected again, and ended up getting 
on the welcome

07:45.764 --> 08:04.124
committee. Bonkers Lane didn't recognize the 
need for students to go out and welcome other

08:04.144 --> 08:12.092
universities to Texas A&M campus. particularly 
when I took him away from his

08:12.511 --> 08:20.661
classes. I really enjoyed all that, but barely got 
through third grade. I think all students had to go

08:27.150 --> 08:31.876
through something like that. What was the 
nickname y'all gave to Professor Samay? Oh, man, I

08:35.240 --> 08:36.802
don't know. Later it would be Mom. I don't know 
whether y'all called him Mom, but later they would

08:38.024 --> 08:41.488
call him Mom Samay. I'm sure he's one of the finest 
guys in the world. I said, where is he? He was one of

08:48.069 --> 08:52.535
the hardest professors I have ever seen anywhere. 
Did you ever have time? I outlined that whole book

08:53.997 --> 08:58.263
before the final just to pass the course. But the 
one thing he could have asked, I couldn't. But I

09:00.405 --> 09:03.730
could derive anything to get the final. Did you 
ever have a class with George Thompson, alphabet,

09:03.997 --> 09:08.002
J.G.H. Thompson? Yeah. He was an M.E. great 
teacher in the 60's. Yeah, I know. Let's see, other

09:14.991 --> 09:21.800
advisor, counselor, student life, M.S.C., core? 
M.S.C., M.S.C., and as a junior, I was a junior

09:22.421 --> 09:29.650
representative. from the Petroleum Engineering 
Club to the Engineering Council. We got to meet

09:34.060 --> 09:39.115
with Dean Barlow. And that was a very enjoyable 
time. I'll never forget going back At

09:45.104 --> 09:59.059
the

09:45.104 --> 09:59.059
time,

09:45.104 --> 09:59.059
what was I, 18 years, 19, I guess, not very long.

10:00.741 --> 10:03.804
Surely I would have been smarter than this. But 
anyway, they've been talking about, at the

10:03.824 --> 10:05.666
council meeting, it's all a lot of process. The 
coding over there, the coding was due too long, and

10:05.686 --> 10:07.868
they can't get to the other classes. So they're 
working at it. The first patrol meeting here, just

10:08.809 --> 10:11.051
ahead, monthly, at night. I'll get up. I'll call 
you anyway next time. It was a junior

10:18.001 --> 10:21.066
representative. The president conducts the 
club. I asked the junior representative if he

10:24.050 --> 10:25.352
wants to say anything. You know, they were saying 
that the props are holding people too long. So if

10:29.960 --> 10:35.068
any of you guys have trouble, just let me

10:29.960 --> 10:35.068
know. Who is that guy? The senior year I was elected 
as the president of the Petroleum Industry Club,

10:38.125 --> 10:56.992
vice president of the client, student senator, 
and a few other things. Probably if you looked

10:57.012 --> 11:01.939
through the annuals, you'd see all this type of 
stuff. MSC. Tell me what role it played in the life

11:03.269 --> 11:07.875
of the student in your days. All of the meetings 
that we had, the students hadn't met

11:07.895 --> 11:24.076
over there all the time. I assume the problem still 
does. The ballroom was there. I know we had some of

11:27.160 --> 11:28.382
the smaller dances there. I was looking back there 
and I saw, it's interesting, my wife, she's a fish

11:29.155 --> 11:44.290
baller, she's a sophomore, she's a military 
baller, she's a junior here and a senior there.

11:44.310 --> 11:56.563
So...

11:44.310 --> 11:56.563
Did you have any interaction with Wayne Stark? 
Very, very little. I was chairman of the Muster

12:01.193 --> 12:05.798
Committee my senior year. And as a result,

12:06.740 --> 12:24.821
I had quite a

12:06.740 --> 12:24.821
bit to do with the executive director of the 
college students. Herbie? Yeah. Still going

12:26.523 --> 12:27.664
strong. Yeah. Describe that muster. Where was it 
held and what did you do? It was held on the steps of

12:32.675 --> 12:37.142
the MSC. My first year it was held in that system 
construction,

12:37.162 --> 12:52.084
which is the Jack Williams building, if I can write 
your name. It was held there. Late afternoon,

12:54.644 --> 12:58.048
night, when? Probably about, it was late 
afternoon,

12:58.069 --> 13:11.606
about probably 5, probably 5, maybe 5.15, 5.30. 
Who came?

13:15.311 --> 13:18.335
Let's see, yeah, I had to get it. Four Star Channel, 
Air Force. I saw something in the Aggie

13:21.847 --> 13:35.223
just the other day. Something's happened, I 
think, too. But who attended in the audience?

13:45.175 --> 13:48.900
Almost all seniors were there, particularly in 
the fourth. Did

13:50.753 --> 14:09.979
it make any kind of emotional impression on you, 
muster, at that point? Certainly not as an

14:09.999 --> 14:18.230
impression.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.153
But on and on, it got more important. I had not

14:21.466 --> 14:38.696
only a roommate, but I also had another gentleman 
who was killed in another outfit. In fact, I ended

14:38.716 --> 14:46.950
up switching over to the artillery my junior year. 
and I didn't want to let four years and then decided

14:47.302 --> 14:59.177
two, so I ended up getting into Coastal

14:47.302 --> 14:59.177
Artillery. Ended up going into the artillery for 
two years and serving all of El Paso. Oh, Fort

15:04.424 --> 15:05.465
Bliss. Taught electronics and radar 
circumstances. I know of no city that has a more

15:12.213 --> 15:15.958
positive relationship with a military 
installation in El Paso's fields by Fort Bliss. I

15:23.163 --> 15:26.709
don't believe that. What about silver caps? Where 
was it held and what was done? Of course, I made two

15:31.256 --> 15:42.073
of those as being in the unit

15:31.256 --> 15:42.073
where the person had died and belonged to. And it 
was in front of the academic building. Is

15:43.867 --> 15:50.298
it still healthy? I would think so. Where were the 
bugles?

16:01.756 --> 16:04.080
Up there. And what did you and your classmates do 
after did y'all

16:10.512 --> 16:26.580
did y'all

16:10.512 --> 16:26.580
react seriously

16:26.999 --> 16:40.360
What role did silver caps and luster and things 
like that, what role did those events have in

16:26.999 --> 16:40.360
creating your feelings about the institution? I 
think it all goes together. I think it all goes

16:43.004 --> 16:43.605
together. You can't really say which one is the 
most important. Certainly, certainly luster

16:46.270 --> 16:50.136
right now. It was very, very big. I don't know

16:52.244 --> 17:14.284
how I would

16:52.244 --> 17:14.284
have felt if I had gone there and not been involved.

17:18.828 --> 17:22.251
Probably not nearly as strong as I've been. Let's 
see.

17:29.461 --> 17:34.107
Football weekend, home football game weekend. 
Describe a typical routine for you as a freshman.

17:38.232 --> 17:42.758
It was just like almost any other

17:38.232 --> 17:42.758
thing. You're right there with a sophomore in your 
face saying, you get all freshman, you know. I

17:48.185 --> 17:59.574
can't

17:48.185 --> 17:59.574
hear

17:48.185 --> 17:59.574
you. Then later on, a few times, my future wife was 
going to one year to Kilgore Junior College and

18:05.920 --> 18:15.276
then the rest of the time was at North Texas so it was 
quite a ways off. She didn't have a car either so it

18:15.376 --> 18:27.977
was a little difficult for her to get down there but 
occasionally she'd come down which she did and we

18:15.376 --> 18:27.977
absolutely had a great time. Now where would she 
stay? She stayed one time at the AEMM and one time at

18:29.459 --> 18:31.202
the MSC. Well, more than once in Tennessee. 
Several times. Who paid her rent? Who paid for the

18:41.921 --> 18:43.583
rent? I'm sure I did. So it was the young man's 
responsibility? Oh, yeah. And she would come down

18:47.789 --> 18:49.852
on the train? No, usually with another girl. The 
freshman ball, her father brought her. She would

18:56.742 --> 19:02.910
normally get there, win on the front, or center, if 
it was football. I

19:05.472 --> 19:15.081
don't remember it being over one night. I think it 
was, you know. So she got there on Saturday. Yeah.

19:19.404 --> 19:20.966
You do know that we had classes. Oh, sure, sure. 
Saturday mornings. That's hard for today's

19:24.109 --> 19:26.371
students to accept. And, you know, they still have 
those. Yeah, they can't believe that. On the

19:31.375 --> 19:32.616
football weekend. Sure, sure. One thing that was 
interesting, before the ring dance, she did get

19:35.712 --> 20:03.750
down the night before and I was really awaiting her 
arrival because I needed her to type my evaluation

19:35.712 --> 20:03.750
report, term report to Mr. Whiting, which was 
quite lengthy. I can remember that We stayed up the

20:05.092 --> 20:11.020
whole night

20:05.092 --> 20:11.020
before the ring dance. So we were not quite at our 
best the next night. Describe that ring dance.

20:19.532 --> 20:20.173
Where was it? Out in the grove. Do you remember what 
group played? No, yeah, because I had a partner

20:24.078 --> 20:31.168
responsible, but we just didn't have a real good 
pick. Fucked me all these years. Johnny Long.

20:35.078 --> 20:37.241
Horsetown or something. I think it'd be the only 
thing anyone's ever heard. What really bugged me

20:40.727 --> 20:47.117
was that I was a usher the year before at the senior 
ring dance and they had Ray Anthony. Oh, boy. Yeah.

20:48.399 --> 20:49.401
And his bookends. Those good-looking girls. Oh, 
wow. Wow. And who went to the ring dance? Just the

20:56.713 --> 21:00.539
seniors. They, uh, any seniors. You know, 
unfortunately we got no pictures. which we, in our

21:03.091 --> 21:15.576
bedroom, you'll see the rain over here, the two of 
us, a little younger.

21:15.596 --> 21:16.678
And what if it had rained? Was there a fallback? I'm 
sure it would have been the those days portion of

21:21.494 --> 21:26.298
the MSC, but that is so small. Oh yeah. For some of 
the smaller classes, that would have probably

21:27.319 --> 21:35.467
worked out, but I don't know. I heard it started out 
with over 2,000 in the freshman class, which at

21:35.487 --> 21:41.253
that time was rather large. I think we ended up 
graduating with about 7,000. At the ring dance,

21:45.137 --> 21:48.640
describe what people wore. And

21:50.054 --> 22:18.812
what

21:50.054 --> 22:18.812
kind of conduct was normal? How did people behave?

22:25.476 --> 22:26.317
Really pretty sane.

22:31.143 --> 22:33.146
I don't remember anything out loud at all. Once the 
dance was over, where did a young couple go

22:33.827 --> 22:39.894
afterward to celebrate or anything? Well, that 
just depends. There's all kinds of... I can

22:48.965 --> 22:59.520
remember

22:48.965 --> 22:59.520
a big group of us ended up at the Clay Pits. Have you 
heard of the Clay Pits? Sure. And what would y'all

23:01.403 --> 23:03.486
be doing at the Clay Pits? Well, what did young 
people do at the Clay Pits at that time when there

23:03.506 --> 23:10.076
was a group? I'm sure they were going to beer or 
something. Just extend the party. And where did

23:15.023 --> 23:16.525
y'all get the beer?

23:19.103 --> 23:29.720
I don't know if it was in the Texan Drive-In or the 
Triangle or over on Whiskey Bridge, whatever that

23:19.103 --> 23:29.720
is. Describe what Whiskey Bridge was. It was on the 
way to Austin, I think. Farm Road 60 going south.

23:41.077 --> 23:43.521
Yeah, going south, yeah. And a place to go where you 
get alcohol and beer. Did they have any student ID

23:47.521 --> 23:51.267
requirement? Did anybody have to prove their age? 
Usually we had somebody in there that we served or

23:53.650 --> 24:00.781
something. So we started in 51 and we had quite a few 
beds. If that wasn't the problem. If somebody

24:10.175 --> 24:14.642
wanted to go somewhere and drink a beer, buy a beer 
and drink it, where

24:15.230 --> 24:27.208
do they go?

24:27.228 --> 24:30.953
You know, I really didn't drink that much. That's 
what I can call it. But usually I'm trying to order a

24:32.776 --> 24:34.739
little Pepsi. It was almost all of it. Was hard 
liquors going around? I don't know. This is the

24:37.184 --> 24:45.074
check man named Hurdlecock down, I think it was Ed 
Hurdlecock, down the old Weldon Road. Uncle Ed?

24:45.755 --> 24:46.396
That's it. Uncle Ed. Uncle Ed. Yeah, where was 
that? I've never made Uncle Ed, but it was on Weldon

24:49.400 --> 24:52.343
Road. It was south of Kyle Field. All right, now 
what did you hear about Uncle Ed's? Was it kind of

24:58.171 --> 25:01.375
off limits or? I don't know.

25:08.082 --> 25:13.467
But we didn't have addiction tickets then, or any 
place like that. Let's make believe that you and

25:13.487 --> 25:21.876
some of your buddies, or your date, that y'all 
wanted to go eat off campus.

25:25.620 --> 25:35.810
Well, one

25:25.620 --> 25:35.810
of the places that we went, not necessarily on 
campus, but just off, going away, and so on. And

25:35.830 --> 25:36.891
there's different places. It was just out of

25:37.647 --> 26:00.895
the University

25:37.647 --> 26:00.895
that goes by the

25:37.647 --> 26:00.895
hill. Yes, I want to say probably was located not 
too far from the hill. My wife said that was one of

26:04.339 --> 26:07.102
the first things the guys did when the girls left. 
No. All right, did you and your wife-to-be get

26:07.432 --> 26:14.342
engaged while you were still a student? Did it, by 
chance, happen in College Station? No, it didn't

26:18.087 --> 26:32.127
happen on the 31st

26:18.087 --> 26:32.127
or

26:18.087 --> 26:32.127
some of the 4th. Oh, OK. So I was going to ask. Let's 
see, MSC, YMCA, were there any important events,

26:36.963 --> 26:47.876
offices at the Y? Don't worry, but you know, I don't 
think I ever, everything I did, I don't think I was

26:47.896 --> 27:02.393
ever involved in anything at the Y. I was pretty 
involved in the church there. Describe that. A

27:05.498 --> 27:20.911
couple of years when I was there on the weekend, I 
built there two, three, four times a week. I had a

27:20.931 --> 27:24.739
student wife.

27:25.445 --> 27:36.697
Now, were those high school girls or local? Yeah, 
they were local.

27:43.224 --> 27:49.330
And I presume you were a Baptist back home. Did the 
church have an important role in your A&M Was there

27:54.858 --> 27:55.579
help? Did it give you some strength? Oh, 
absolutely.

28:03.716 --> 28:13.916
Yeah.

28:13.936 --> 28:15.339
You know you've got all the help you can get when 
you're there, but... It's...

28:21.065 --> 28:40.036
He was

28:21.065 --> 28:40.036
a

28:21.065 --> 28:40.036
student?

28:45.565 --> 28:46.727
Yeah. Oh. Well, I think we played baseball 
together. We also were in the college. Was there a

28:57.764 --> 29:02.756
religious emphasis week in those days? Yeah. 
Describe that.

29:10.238 --> 29:34.967
I'm trying to remember

29:10.238 --> 29:34.967
who, the different ones.

29:34.987 --> 29:35.688
There's always a guy in the office. Looks like the 
guy up there, but he didn't have to go. I had the,

29:36.810 --> 29:38.912
after the first Memphis to Dallas one year, we had 
Frontbrook Presbyterian in Washington, D.C.

29:44.360 --> 30:06.506
And

29:44.360 --> 30:06.506
then you break down into smaller groups, number of 
local pastors and so forth. And we're discussing

30:06.526 --> 30:08.809
that group. It's not really a study as it is. It's 
what's troubling you and what you want to do, what

30:09.510 --> 30:12.393
you feel better, that type of thing. It leads you in 
the right direction. Now, were there some

30:14.330 --> 30:24.908
counselor types that students could go to 
throughout the year to just get advice? No, I'm not

30:25.008 --> 30:27.172
sure. I was so involved in so many things, I really 
didn't need it. Now, Old Faith Chapel wasn't yet?

30:35.887 --> 30:36.127
No. It wasn't yet. David Martin

30:39.845 --> 30:47.112
as president, living in the president's home. Oh, 
that old frame house. Yeah. In fact, I remember

30:49.254 --> 30:52.117
going there several times. Describe it. Not

30:54.159 --> 31:08.634
a lot different from a lot

30:54.159 --> 31:08.634
of the houses that I grew up in in Toronto. One of the 
Do

31:09.528 --> 31:21.146
you remember any kind of pranks or jokes students 
ever played on the house or on the people who lived

31:09.528 --> 31:21.146
in the house? Not even like the things I've heard 
some other people do. I've not heard of them. No, I

31:28.417 --> 31:31.682
have not heard of them. See, I was there.
