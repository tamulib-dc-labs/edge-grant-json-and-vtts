Today's interview is with Harry E. Whitmore, 
Assistant Director of the Texas Engineering

00:08.030 --> 00:16.559
Experiment Station at Texas A&M University. 
Today's date is August 3rd, 1982.

00:21.624 --> 00:25.509
Let's begin, Mr. Whitmore, by your telling us 
something about your early years. Where and when

00:25.909 --> 00:27.030
were you born? I was born in Denison, Texas on 
December the 7th, 1920.

00:36.262 --> 00:39.406
What was the occupation of your father? My father 
was a salesman. He sold almost anything. Paint.

00:44.833 --> 00:48.959
Independent salesman.

00:48.979 --> 00:51.763
And he traveled quite a bit. But he worked for a lot 
of different companies selling different

00:51.783 --> 00:57.570
things. Did you spend all your boyhood in Denison? 
Yes, I left there to come to A&M when I was 16. You

01:07.075 --> 01:09.799
graduated from high school at Jefferson? Yes. So 
you graduated in 1936 then? Right. And you came

01:14.125 --> 01:16.127
here and you studied in 1940? I got out A&M in 42. 42. 
And you studied mechanical engineering? Right.

01:24.218 --> 01:28.404
What was the reason that you chose to study 
engineering? Oh, a pure accident, I guess. I

01:30.287 --> 01:33.050
didn't have any idea what I was doing at that time. 
But it turned out to be pretty good. Were you

01:36.893 --> 01:39.516
mechanically inclined as a youth? Not 
particularly. It was the popular thing to do in

01:42.560 --> 01:47.126
those days, and like it is today. Did you have a 
strong background in mathematics? Yes, I had math

01:49.769 --> 01:55.516
and physics and all that in high school. Is that 
essential to the Master of Engineering program? I

01:58.399 --> 02:04.707
think it is, and it's even more so today, because 
it's a lot harder today than it was when I took it. I

02:06.104 --> 02:15.833
didn't even

02:06.104 --> 02:15.833
know what a computer was. I was here four years and 
left here and went into the Army. Everybody did.

02:25.863 --> 02:27.164
I'm 42. No, I got out of high school in 36. You came 
here in 38. There was a two-year period between

02:34.016 --> 02:40.242
when you came here and I came here in 38. What was it 
like when you were a student here back in the late

02:40.262 --> 02:44.045
30s? Well, it was all military, of course. There 
was a lot of hazing, but an awful lot of fun. There

02:52.974 --> 03:01.862
weren't any women here, except my wife was from 
Bryan, so there were a few here.

03:06.044 --> 03:13.936
I'd say the traditions and spirit and all is about 
the same as it is today. But it's a lot bigger now. I

03:17.441 --> 03:20.867
think there were 6,000 students here when I came. 
That was pretty large at that time. It was large.

03:24.352 --> 03:27.977
What was the reason that you chose A&M to attend 
over any other university? All my friends from

03:27.997 --> 03:31.663
Denison came to A&M, so I came with them.

03:34.630 --> 03:40.036
There wasn't anything particular about the 
university. And, oh, I guess eight guys who

03:40.056 --> 03:47.564
graduated the year before me from high school were 
down here. So that was the real reason I came. When

03:52.089 --> 03:54.612
you left in 1942, you went to the Army. Right. 
Where? Where did I go first? Camp Perry, Ohio. No,

04:02.120 --> 04:06.064
that's wrong.

04:06.084 --> 04:14.413
I went to the San Antonio Arsenal for about a month, 
merely to get processed, and then I went to Camp

04:06.084 --> 04:14.413
Perry, Ohio. Is that P-E-A-R-Y or P-E-E-R-Y? 
P-E-R-R-Y. And how long were you there? About

04:23.002 --> 04:29.269
three or four months, maybe five. Then I went to 
Camp Thunston.

04:37.557 --> 04:40.140
You know, we get into this, it'll take. I've lived 
in 32 houses in the 20 years I was in the Army. Oh, you

04:45.748 --> 04:47.230
were in the Army 20 years. Oh, okay. Well, we won't 
go into each of them. But I, in general, I was in

04:51.535 --> 05:01.708
Europe during World War II and in Korea, but mainly 
I was in guided missile business. When you entered

05:02.465 --> 05:05.428
the Army, what rank did you face? First, a second 
lieutenant. A second lieutenant. What did you

05:10.674 --> 05:11.395
promote to eventually? A colonel. A colonel. When 
were you promoted to colonel? I guess that was in

05:15.680 --> 05:22.888
about 58, 1958.

05:26.872 --> 05:32.218
See, I got out of the Army in 1962.

05:32.671 --> 05:36.777
So during the long time you were in the military, 
what were some of the places that you could study?

05:36.797 --> 05:38.980
Just give me a sample of five or six places. I was at 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California

05:39.200 --> 05:46.671
Institute of Technology. I was at Douglas 
Aircraft Company. I was at... Where? In Santa

05:50.898 --> 05:52.019
Monica. And at White Sands Missile Range. and at 
the Ballistic Research Laboratory at Aberdeen,

05:58.169 --> 06:12.895
Maryland,

05:58.169 --> 06:12.895
and with the Missile Command of the Air Force in 
Westchester, California. So it was mainly, and I

06:12.915 --> 06:22.152
was in Japan two years, and in Korea a year, and in 
Europe about two and a half years. During this time

06:22.351 --> 06:26.436
you were in the military, did you concentrate on 
any one particular area? Guided missiles. Guided

06:27.618 --> 06:28.799
missiles. Tell me something about that, please. 
Well, let's see. The Army had all of the missile

06:33.945 --> 06:48.063
business in the early days, starting in about 46 at 
the Jet Propulsion Lab in California is where it

06:33.945 --> 06:48.063
all started. Under Dr. Von Karman, And I guess the 
Army had about 10 missiles they worked on. The

07:01.247 --> 07:07.995
first one was the Corporal, and the Honest John, 
and the Nike, and the Talos. T-A-L-O-S.

07:11.959 --> 07:13.501
It was joint with the Navy. And Nike, Hercules, and 
the Sergeant, the Redstone. And at about that

07:24.772 --> 07:28.177
point, the Air Force got in the act. I guess that was 
1956.

07:34.867 --> 07:38.913
And they took over the large missiles, the Atlas. I 
worked on the Atlas Centaur and General Dynamics

07:39.154 --> 07:46.645
after I got out again. And that was the start of the 
space program, the Agena, the Centaur, the Atlas.

07:55.180 --> 08:03.230
And the Redstone, I guess, was the one, it was an 
Army missile that put the first satellite into

07:55.180 --> 08:03.230
orbit. And when that happened, I was in White 
Sands, and that was actually before the Russians

08:03.250 --> 08:13.602
put up Sputnik, but it wasn't much of a satellite. 
And since then, I think you, I guess I got out of the

08:15.885 --> 08:22.032
Army about,

08:24.543 --> 08:31.793
Well, the last thing I worked on the Army was the 
advanced satellite, which was a communications

08:24.543 --> 08:31.793
satellite. And I did that in California and 
Westchester with the Air Force, because the Air

08:33.796 --> 08:45.493
Force at that point had taken over the missiles, 
the big ones. You do research regarding guided

08:45.513 --> 08:48.918
missiles. Could you tell me a little more about 
that, what kind of research you did? Well, I don't

08:52.808 --> 08:53.769
know. I guess you'd call it development, really. I 
don't think any missile has ever been started to be

08:56.452 --> 09:04.640
built that wasn't state of the art. In other words, 
that was a rule. And so there's no research

09:07.523 --> 09:14.570
involved in building guided missiles, which is 
what I did. So I guess you would call it development

09:14.590 --> 09:17.212
in our research. It involved pushing the state of 
the art. But there was never any doubt that they

09:23.251 --> 09:27.818
could be built. They wouldn't have started

09:27.838 --> 09:31.584
them. The Nike was probably the most complicated, 
which was a surface-to-air missile that defended

09:31.604 --> 09:43.704
the country, I guess, 20 years. There's still Nike 
bases that are activated.

09:51.331 --> 09:58.742
It was mainly a guidance problem, how to get the 
missile to where the airplane was. You served in

09:58.762 --> 10:02.749
the Army during both war and peacetime. As far as an 
officer in the Army, how is it different in wartime

10:02.869 --> 10:07.936
and peacetime? Is there any difference in what you 
do? Well, yes. You get shot at in wartime.

10:14.667 --> 10:18.232
Peacetime, you don't. And that's the rather broad 
subject. I wasn't an infantry officer. And during

10:23.941 --> 10:34.732
peacetime, the major part of the Army, which is the 
fighting people, they maneuver and get ready to

10:23.941 --> 10:34.732
fight. And the more time they get shot. Where were 
you stationed during World War II? I was with the

10:41.499 --> 10:47.005
9th Armored Division and it landed in Normandy and 
went clear through to the Russians' office. And I

10:52.478 --> 10:54.400
was with it the whole time. I was division ordnance 
officer.

10:59.244 --> 11:02.007
Which was, that was a pretty nice war, frankly. And 
that's a nice thing. Was you married before or

11:03.968 --> 11:05.129
after the war? Before. Your wife stayed at Brown 
while you were with Olsen. Right.

11:12.676 --> 11:16.279
And you said you moved, you lived in 32 different 
houses while you were in the military. Right.

11:19.250 --> 11:22.134
That's over 20 years. Some of them were in the same 
town or on the same army base. OK, you retired.

11:32.687 --> 11:36.672
While you were in the military, did you do any 
graduate work during that time? Yes, I took a

11:37.073 --> 11:41.899
master's degree at Purdue. Purdue, Indiana. What 
time was that report then? That's the

11:44.983 --> 11:46.725
chancellor's old home. Lafayette, Indiana. 
Lafayette. I went first in 50 and went a year, and

11:51.913 --> 12:00.905
they took me out and sent me to Korea, and then I went 
back in 55 and finished. You've done a master of

12:00.925 --> 12:04.790
science in mechanical engineering. Did you do any 
research regarding the thesis? No. What was the

12:09.056 --> 12:11.719
subject of your program? It was jet propulsion. 
Jet propulsion.

12:18.329 --> 12:23.076
Okay, then let's take it back to 1962 when you 
retired from the military. Where did you go then? I

12:24.518 --> 12:31.088
went to General Dynamics Astronautics in San 
Diego and worked on the Atlas. As a what? As a

12:32.871 --> 12:34.293
systems engineer. And how long were you there? I 
was systems engineering manager on the Atlas. I

12:41.844 --> 12:43.046
was there about two years. And then where? You came 
to A&M in 64? In what capacity? As head of the Space

12:49.921 --> 12:55.449
Technology Division, which didn't exist. Of 
which department? It's not in a department. It's

12:58.313 --> 13:02.660
part of the Engineering Experiment Station. And 
you held that until 1967 when you became assistant

13:02.680 --> 13:07.487
director of the Engineering Experiment Station? 
Associate director. Excuse me, associate

13:08.909 --> 13:10.071
director.

13:17.915 --> 13:23.924
What was the reason that you decided to leave 
California to come back to Texas A&M? Well, my wife

13:24.024 --> 13:30.273
was from here, and both her parents were in bad 
health. That had a lot to do with it, but also

13:30.293 --> 13:41.930
California was getting pretty damn wild, and I was 
terrified of the traffic. And I came here to make a

13:41.950 --> 13:46.437
speech on jet propulsion, Fred Benson, I told him 
he wasn't getting with the space program and A&M

13:47.210 --> 13:53.597
had nothing in the way of space. He said, well, why 
don't you come back here and fix it? So I did. It was a

14:01.446 --> 14:05.291
combination

14:01.446 --> 14:05.291
of things. So A&M didn't get involved in the space 
program until 64. I take that back. John Calhoun

14:16.336 --> 14:27.291
had just received the first NASA grant in the state 
of Texas as principal investigator for A&M. And

14:27.311 --> 14:30.536
the minute I got here, he turned it over to me. Don 
Calvin was, I guess he was academic vice president

14:30.556 --> 14:41.531
then. Or was he? Anyway, he'd been dean of 
engineering. What were some of the things some of

14:46.795 --> 14:51.199
the innovations that came with the introduction 
of space program research here? Well, the Olney

14:52.040 --> 15:02.709
Teague Building, for one thing, was built by NASA 
in order to enhance the space program.

15:02.729 --> 15:11.037
It wasn't too long until the program ran about $2 
million a year there for 10 years. We did a lot of

15:11.898 --> 15:13.339
work with Houston. And we have the only wind tunnel 
in this part of the country And Houston did a lot of

15:18.352 --> 15:21.416
work with us there. And it was spread out not only 
through engineering, but in physics and

15:22.758 --> 15:32.573
mathematics

15:22.758 --> 15:32.573
all over the place. Are there any specific things 
that you can think of that A&M contributed to the

15:33.134 --> 15:38.501
space program? Yes, if you look out in the lobby, 
you'll see a model of the space shuttle that was

15:38.521 --> 15:47.835
built here entirely and tested. What year was 
that? Oh, that was about six years ago. Obviously

15:56.739 --> 16:01.346
before they flew the first one. I'd say six years 
ago. That's kind of interesting. We did an awful

16:06.314 --> 16:15.088
lot of work with Houston on heat shields for the 
shuttle and communications for the space

16:06.314 --> 16:15.088
shuttle.

16:19.962 --> 16:48.703
we had here for up until

16:19.962 --> 16:48.703
a year ago the original graph that john calvin got 
in 64 was still in force a year ago they renewed it

16:19.962 --> 16:48.703
each year it was the oldest nasa grant in the 
country and out of it grew our remote sensing

16:19.962 --> 16:48.703
center which is the largest I guess, in the world. 
They do all kinds of work with the agricultural

16:52.728 --> 16:58.655
people. I'd say the space program spun off the 
remote sensing center. It built the old ET

17:04.063 --> 17:06.166
building. And there are many programs in our space 
right now that grew out of the old Themis program.

17:16.595 --> 17:25.386
which was DOD, but our ability to get into that 
stemmed from working the space program. So what's

17:25.406 --> 17:38.061
happened, it sort of spun out and made a lot of other 
things and then really it

17:25.406 --> 17:38.061
evolved. What are some of the things that A&M is 
doing now regarding the space program?

17:48.083 --> 17:58.313
We're still doing a lot of wind tunnel testing and 
work on the shuttle, and I guess we almost will. The

17:58.333 --> 18:03.798
EE department is doing quite a bit of work in the 
communications area. How do you communicate from

18:03.938 --> 18:17.972
there, from the ground, the satellites

18:03.938 --> 18:17.972
and the remote sensing center has all kinds of NASA 
programs. How do you improve on sensors that go in

18:24.667 --> 18:32.036
satellites? But mainly, how do you utilize the 
data that you get from a satellite? What you get is

18:38.764 --> 18:42.588
way more data than you want. So how do you separate 
out the wheat from the chaff? It's a big program.

18:48.968 --> 18:57.659
The Landsat satellite produces tons of data, and 
NASA provides that to us. And out of that, you can

18:58.020 --> 19:03.246
predict the world wheat crop. You can tell whether 
a pecan orchard is infected with disease or not.

19:10.015 --> 19:15.482
You can tell how wet the ground is here

19:17.504 --> 19:27.480
It's a matter of taking satellite data and finding 
out more and more and more things every day. It's an

19:28.041 --> 19:33.050
information processing operation. And this data 
comes from radar, visible, infrared, so you've

19:33.070 --> 19:41.183
got many different

19:44.318 --> 19:51.367
wavelengths of radiation, really, is what you're 
working with, be it light, radar, whatever. And

19:51.387 --> 20:01.559
how do you sort that out is a real problem in applied 
mathematics and many other things. And we do a good

20:01.579 --> 20:06.505
job at that. In your capacity, do you work with 
students, or how do you work with them? All of our

20:11.369 --> 20:29.016
research program involves graduate students and 
also wherever possible undergraduate students

20:11.369 --> 20:29.016
because that's what turns an undergraduate 
student into a graduate student is to get him

20:11.369 --> 20:29.016
interested in the research. How many graduate 
students do you have involved in this type of

20:29.597 --> 20:33.262
research? Oh, I would guess around

20:33.282 --> 20:39.672
six or seven hundred. If

20:41.609 --> 20:54.307
somebody came up to you and told you they thought 
the money the taxpayers put into the space program

20:41.609 --> 20:54.307
had been a waste of money, how would you reply to 
that? Well, to some extent,

20:54.328 --> 21:03.100
it would be hard to defend because it's an awful lot 
of money. But the only way you could defend it is to

21:04.182 --> 21:09.810
point out the spinoffs from it. which are new 
materials, new medicine,

21:11.157 --> 21:26.611
the ability to do all these things I just said, 
remote sensing. And I don't believe I could

21:26.631 --> 21:37.722
justify it on a straight economic basis, nor would 
I try, nor do I see any reason to. What do they say?

21:40.655 --> 21:41.957
Why do you climb mountains? Because they're 
there. I think we'll see an awful lot spin off of the

21:45.121 --> 21:49.368
shuttle that hasn't shown up. That's a whole 
different world. That's a complete freight car.

21:54.756 --> 21:57.980
You could put it in that thing and put it in orbit. 
And up to now, we've been working with little bitty

21:58.000 --> 22:01.706
things. Now you can put this whole floor up in 
orbit. It'll become commercial. Where do the

22:10.439 --> 22:16.445
funds to operate your research program come from? 
We have about $30 million a year of that. Roughly,

22:23.253 --> 22:32.843
it's a third federal government, a third state, 
and a third other industry foundation.

22:35.866 --> 22:38.269
And of the state, about Half of it is state revenue. 
The other half is work we do for other state

22:42.798 --> 22:53.150
agencies. How

22:53.170 --> 23:00.639
many people do you have working under your 
service? Well, I don't want to count all the

23:00.659 --> 23:08.948
students and see what What we have is a lot of parts 
of people. So I would guess involved are about

23:13.688 --> 23:18.516
1,000 people. Now, full-time equivalent people, 
probably about 600. Many of them are

23:25.468 --> 23:30.497
three-quarter time or half time or very And from 
day to day, it changes by 20%, whether they're

23:30.865 --> 23:55.316
going to go teach some more or research some more.

23:55.336 --> 23:56.337
Have you done any teaching while you've been here? 
No. What are some of the major changes that you've

23:56.437 --> 23:58.560
seen since you've been here over the last 18 years? 
Well, all these new buildings, for one thing, and

24:02.129 --> 24:07.455
it's been magnificent. I think at one point there 
was $90 million worth of construction going on

24:07.475 --> 24:13.420
when this building was being built. There was a lot 
of others being built. It's really the fiscal plan

24:16.864 --> 24:21.208
has at least tripled. The red tape has tripled, and 
that's partially due to the federal government,

24:28.763 --> 24:36.114
partially due to the state, and partially due to 
just getting bigger. The bigger you get, the more

24:36.134 --> 24:38.297
red tape there is. There's no way to cut through the 
red tape?

24:43.826 --> 24:45.468
Oh, yeah, there's ways. We don't want to go into 
that. That's real complicated. Of course, the

24:50.315 --> 24:56.104
thing that has been most impressive is the quality 
of the people here. They have really got some

24:56.624 --> 25:01.288
crackerjack people. And this is not yet known in 
general. The public really doesn't know what's

25:07.735 --> 25:10.517
going on at A&M. Even the former students don't 
know. And that's one thing we need to work on. And

25:17.244 --> 25:26.192
that is

25:17.244 --> 25:26.192
to not improve our image falsely, because we don't 
have to. But just get the word out. We did a lousy job

25:30.184 --> 25:33.809
of that. And this is by far the best group of 
engineering talent in the world. And I guess MIT

25:41.642 --> 25:49.073
and Caltech have ten times the reputation we did. 
It's in that way anymore than it was 18 years ago.

25:54.944 --> 25:58.608
What's the reason you've been able to attract such 
top-ranking freshmen? Well, it's warmer here.

26:02.172 --> 26:14.165
And

26:02.172 --> 26:14.165
the resources of Texas A&M are by far better than 
most places. The permanent university fund is

26:14.185 --> 26:17.189
why. In fact, if I had to pick one thing, that's it. 
That's why. And it really makes

26:24.728 --> 26:29.132
a difference. A lot of people would like to have it. 
Do you think that the permanent university fund is

26:33.416 --> 26:40.202
going to be divided up among these other smaller 
universities in the state? There will be a very

26:40.402 --> 26:43.765
concerted effort to do that. I hope not. Whether it 
will or won't depends on how good we defend it.

26:56.099 --> 27:06.131
Because without it, we wouldn't be first class.

27:06.151 --> 27:09.602
And the University of Texas is a first class 
school, too.

27:24.314 --> 27:26.276
how broad engineering research is. Well,

27:28.179 --> 27:39.653
the best way to get that across to anybody is, I 
think, through examples of the things that we are

27:28.179 --> 27:39.653
doing. And this is an engineering research 
program. And it's pretty obvious that the basic

27:43.317 --> 27:53.730
engineering disciplines, the departments, MA, 
the old timers, or MA electrical, And chemical.

27:58.636 --> 28:03.241
And then they added aerospace and industrial.

28:05.403 --> 28:07.625
And what else we got? Civil, probably the oldest. 
And nuclear engineering and petroleum

28:12.009 --> 28:18.876
engineering. That, to most people, is 
engineering. The problem is nowadays is putting

28:22.448 --> 28:26.854
them together. There is not any single problem of 
work that I know of that can be solved by any one

28:27.194 --> 28:34.965
department. That's just not in the game. So you 
really can't have a mechanical engineering

28:37.248 --> 28:48.743
research program because mechanical engineers 
can only contribute to a broader solution of a

28:49.178 --> 28:55.065
problem that's worth solving. So what we do is put 
mechanicals, industrials, and electricals

28:55.085 --> 29:05.999
together and do remote sensing, for example.

29:06.019 --> 29:17.393
Quite often, one of the departments will take the 
lead in a research problem, but then go get the help

29:06.019 --> 29:17.393
they need from other departments to really do the 
job. But even broader than that, We now have added

29:20.583 --> 29:27.253
some things that you probably wouldn't call 
engineering. You might not call remote sensing

29:28.295 --> 29:41.415
engineering, because it does involve 
agriculture and hydraulics and all sorts of

29:28.295 --> 29:41.415
things. And you probably wouldn't agree that food 
protein research is engineering, but we have food

29:49.928 --> 29:55.036
protein research program in tea that's about a 
million and a half a year. And it's largely an

29:56.878 --> 30:00.864
engineering problem.

30:03.909 --> 30:09.397
And now we have added the teas of business and 
technology. We have a division of teas in the

30:10.880 --> 30:14.485
business college. in order that we can get what we 
do out on the street and use, because engineers

30:15.848 --> 30:23.940
aren't very good at business people. That's the 
root. We have a geotechnology division, which

30:25.502 --> 30:34.014
couples with the College of Geosciences. And we 
put together a team of engineers and geosciences

30:34.034 --> 30:41.465
to solve

30:34.034 --> 30:41.465
problems. And we got one known as Technology and 
Society, which is the liberal arts college. And we

30:49.120 --> 30:59.532
couple them up with engineers and do urban work, 
because they can keep us from getting all the folks

30:49.120 --> 30:59.532
mad at us. So we have brought in the engineering, at 
least what is known as the engineering experiment

31:00.993 --> 31:11.725
station, to include business, geosciences,

31:13.510 --> 31:20.097
The College of Liberal Arts, the College of 
Education has a TEAS division.

31:20.657 --> 31:26.103
We run the data processing center for the whole 
system. We run the nuclear science center for the

31:26.924 --> 31:32.409
whole system. So it gets to be kind of spread out the 
time you put all this together.

31:44.662 --> 31:54.733
The reason we do it is that you just flat can't solve 
a problem using just one decimal. And see, our

31:55.915 --> 32:01.101
charter is not higher education. Our charter is 
economic development for the state of Texas. And

32:09.590 --> 32:13.875
the fact that we use students, frankly, is because 
they're damn cheap labor. and good labor. And they

32:19.178 --> 32:21.842
have a job. We don't do it so they can get an 
education. If they get one, that's great. And

32:27.448 --> 32:30.692
we'll try to aim it towards that. But we hire an 
awful lot of students strictly to work.

32:41.865 --> 32:45.229
So that's a lot of fun.

32:48.415 --> 32:59.049
And most of our money, well, all but 17% of it, we go 
out and contract and earn. It doesn't come from the

33:00.190 --> 33:01.692
state. How do you go about contracting? Well, 
you've got to find a man who has a problem with some

33:04.155 --> 33:12.886
money and that we have the talent to solve. And then 
you get the guy who. knows how to solve it, eyeball

33:15.365 --> 33:20.891
to eyeball with the guy with the money, that's the 
problem. And they write a contract, and he pays us

33:20.911 --> 33:24.354
to solve this problem. What are some of the 
companies that you've had contracts with? I was

33:27.938 --> 33:29.299
just looking at that. There's about 200. Well, 
just straightforward. Oh, OK. We've done work

33:35.105 --> 33:44.494
with General Electric, LTV in Dallas, Douglas 
Aircraft.

33:56.041 --> 34:03.030
We're

33:56.041 --> 34:03.030
doing a whole lot of work with the electric car 
companies. In fact, we have a standing contract

34:04.271 --> 34:08.997
with Seven that fit into this region, Dallas 
Paralyte, Houston Paralyte, and all of them in

34:09.652 --> 34:18.684
this part of the country. We do work with the 
Electric Power Research Institute, which is a

34:18.704 --> 34:25.874
big, big deal. And all of the petroleum companies I 
don't think all of them that are in Houston. I don't

34:36.261 --> 34:39.365
know of any that we have working with Exxon. What 
are some of the type of work that you've done with

34:39.385 --> 34:45.391
this contract? Well, let's take a specific 
example that's kind of interesting. We have

34:51.398 --> 34:58.205
wanted, of course, Texas is loaded with lignite, 
most of which you can't get at by digging. You've

34:58.225 --> 35:00.668
got to, 90% of it is, below 200 feet, which is about 
the economic depth to dig it up. So we went out here

35:07.880 --> 35:17.613
by the airport and drilled nine wells down into a 
lignite seam. And you have to monitor them, and you

35:19.996 --> 35:23.981
got all the EPA problems. But the final result was, 
You burn it here, and it burns over to this hole, and

35:27.428 --> 35:37.042
you take the gas out, and that has quite a bit of BTU 
value. So we did that with a little bit of our own

35:38.464 --> 35:43.853
money to show we had some hope. It did burn about 30 
minutes and brought us about five oil companies,

35:44.193 --> 35:56.271
Dow Chemical, and another non-oil company. I came 
here and looked at it, and they've been sponsoring

35:57.533 --> 36:07.087
a program to pursue that research for about five 
years now. At about a quarter of a million dollars a

36:07.167 --> 36:10.031
year. And right now we're doing it over at Rockdale 
on the Alcoa property. So that's how that was

36:16.801 --> 36:19.045
yielded in Alcoa. That's an example. And they paid 
for all of it except that. But you've got to prove to

36:25.274 --> 36:26.916
them. that you have some hope of getting there. And 
that's why we need a little bit of that 17% state

36:30.837 --> 36:42.335
money to start up things until we can get some 
credibility. Have you had any problems getting

36:43.677 --> 36:45.760
state funds? Has there been any opposition to 
funding the program? None at all. Well, you go to

36:50.888 --> 36:54.574
the state legislature and say you give me $17 and 
I'll get you $100 for it. You don't have any problem

37:00.819 --> 37:02.121
at all. You go asking for $100, you're going to have 
a real problem. But see, we get out of the $30

37:06.647 --> 37:15.820
million, to put it in other terms, we get about $4 
million from the state. You say, you give me $4 and

37:15.840 --> 37:20.948
I'll get you $30 to do research on state problems. 
How could anybody turn that down? It's not his

37:26.802 --> 37:31.247
problem. We don't have a money problem. We have 
people problems. We're a real short people. And

37:39.096 --> 37:40.978
the mean. Right. Right. Right.

37:46.504 --> 37:47.786
Is there anything else you want to add? I'm about to 
run out and so is my voice. What's wrong with me? I

37:52.351 --> 37:53.232
think I'm getting it. I think it started this 
morning. I don't feel bad. It's just sort of

37:59.964 --> 38:03.007
hoarse. I appreciate

38:03.688 --> 38:11.236
you taking the time to talk with me. I enjoy it. I 
like talking about teams. It's a pretty

38:15.441 --> 38:19.405
interesting place.
