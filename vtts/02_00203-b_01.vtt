WEBVTT

00:03.423 --> 00:09.349
a quiz or a question on a quiz in a geology course 
that I was taking. Somehow or another metal got

00:10.491 --> 00:23.264
involved and I said all this scrap metal that we've 
been shipping over to Japan, I was loaded in 1941,

00:10.491 --> 00:23.264
in the spring of 1941, will come back in the way of 
bombs. And I remember answering the question on my

00:25.186 --> 00:30.392
geology quiz. And so I don't know. Of course, we 
didn't know about Pearl Harbor. But it was fairly

00:34.756 --> 00:37.398
obvious. And then, my lord, you get ordered to 
active duty before you graduate.

00:46.006 --> 00:51.871
Now, with a straight face, what war opposition 
groups were there on the campus? None.

00:56.115 --> 00:56.215
None. Let's go to a lighter topic. How did a young 
Aggie get a date in your undergraduate years? Well

01:04.049 --> 01:07.413
there was somebody back in your hometown that you 
would invite down. Or if you happened to know some

01:09.376 --> 01:12.841
gal from Bryan.

01:18.047 --> 01:18.868
Or you had none. And to what activities would she 
normally be in? Well you've got, of course the big

01:23.595 --> 01:27.700
thing you've seen in years, you've seen her ring 
dance. But then RV holidays, another. And then

01:32.243 --> 01:34.386
they had various balls during the year. Each 
regiment had one, as I recall.

01:39.413 --> 01:49.386
I don't remember ever having a date on the campus 
until I was a senior.

01:49.867 --> 01:53.772
But that was just me and others. they weren't 
bringing down trainloads of Tessies in those

01:54.359 --> 01:58.345
days. A lot of gals came down from CIA.

02:05.215 --> 02:09.261
I've heard stories later about moose pots and 
beast buckets. Those are unfamiliar terms. Who

02:12.426 --> 02:15.410
got stuck with the worst moose? Or which girl got 
stuck with the worst beast? I never heard that. If a

02:21.078 --> 02:24.163
young woman was on campus in for a weekend, where 
did she stay? In a dorm or some privileged view at

02:26.301 --> 02:32.071
Aggieland Inn. Would y'all clear out a dorm? Yes, 
vacate. Like in Puryear, for example, they had

02:36.298 --> 02:38.783
ramps. Just clear out two or three ramps. And they 
were very strictly observed. Was a young man

02:44.782 --> 02:48.486
without a date allowed to go to one of these dances? 
Sure he could go. And how often did a pretty young

02:50.248 --> 02:54.152
lady get cut in on? Often. And what do you think was 
the impression that Aggies made on these young

02:56.095 --> 03:01.100
ladies? Well, you could hear all kinds of stories 
after the fact. I've talked to a lot of women since

03:06.066 --> 03:09.449
1941. They tell you I used to go with A&M and loved it 
and loved it. Yeah. That's what I've heard. That's

03:15.237 --> 03:16.559
what I've heard. Yeah, they like to come. Well, why 
not? They were treated royally. And how did the

03:20.505 --> 03:24.310
young man and young woman dress for these dances? 
Well, of course, we wore uniform and ladies wore

03:24.531 --> 03:28.657
evening gowns. Were there any big-time bands that 
came? Sure. Plenty. Such as? Well, whatever. I

03:35.607 --> 03:37.230
can't remember. Artie Shaw... Even the fellow 
that says a one, a two, a three, champagne music.

03:45.111 --> 03:45.531
Lawrence Welk? Yeah, he was there. We had him for an 
RV dance, playing beautiful music. The major

03:50.858 --> 03:54.782
bands, the Dorsey band, everyone. And these were 
in Sabeasa? In Sabeasa. And what was the conduct

03:59.407 --> 04:02.511
pattern of people? How did everybody behave? Very 
well. And could the dance go all night? No. No, it

04:09.241 --> 04:13.185
happened at midnight, one o'clock, whatever, 
curfew. Let's see. You didn't have a car. No. Did

04:18.250 --> 04:21.013
anybody in your outfit have one that everybody 
used? No.

04:24.556 --> 04:27.279
Describe the community around the campus. What 
was College Station then? Where was it? What was

04:29.541 --> 04:30.142
it? Well, College Station in those days 
essentially was, to some extent, at Northgate,

04:37.642 --> 04:40.286
And on each of the two corners there, there were 
drug stores. And then Honick Boot Shop was down

04:41.928 --> 04:47.676
there, and Aggieland Photographers or whatever, 
they were down there. No eating places at all. Was

04:52.162 --> 04:52.983
the movie there? The campus theater? The campus 
theater was there. Yeah, there was a movie. As a

04:58.210 --> 05:01.474
matter of fact, I was the director of Aggie Tone 
News. Tell me about Aggie Tone News. Well...

05:08.422 --> 05:14.992
Somebody had an idea that we should produce a 
newsreel, special events. And of course it was

05:15.613 --> 05:20.460
just, it was video. Yeah, you had no sound to it or 
anything, but a picture of a parade, a halftime

05:20.480 --> 05:28.632
ceremony, a football game or whatever. And there 
weren't very many. We only did it for maybe a half a

05:33.159 --> 05:37.045
dozen times. would write out the script for it, and 
they played them at that theater down there. And

05:42.343 --> 05:48.289
you set up in a booth someplace, and while the thing 
is being shown, you're talking. So when I say the

05:49.731 --> 05:59.903
director of Aggietone News, I was the only one that 
spoke to it, while it was going on. Was this a

05:59.963 --> 06:00.704
paying? No. Director of Narration. Ah, that would 
do it. That's it. Director of Narration of Agaton.

06:09.215 --> 06:12.459
Was there anything at Southgate then? Maidley's 
Pharmacy, was it there yet? No. Okay. Southgate,

06:16.325 --> 06:17.587
Southgate. Immediately south of Project Houses? 
Nothing. Okay. Nothing. Okay. And Old Army Lou

06:23.755 --> 06:27.381
wasn't yet in business, was he? Yes, I believe he 
was. Oh. I believe, maybe I'm confusing it with

06:33.472 --> 06:35.134
after the war. Where did the faculty live? They 
lived south toward Navasota. That's where the

06:43.705 --> 06:48.531
first residential district that I can remember, 
plus some north. Were there some residences on

06:48.851 --> 06:50.333
campus? No. Yes, the president had a house, and 
Baratracks Bolton had a house. He was the dean.

07:02.009 --> 07:03.992
People said, the dean of men? I said, no, he was just 
the dean. But... Did y'all have a nickname for

07:07.456 --> 07:13.104
Gilchrist, dean of engineering? I didn't have 
one. He would just give the... T.O. Walton was the

07:17.149 --> 07:19.112
president of the great... Nickname for him? Just, 
I don't remember any. He just was much respected

07:23.237 --> 07:26.341
and admired. Describe him. Well, he was just a very 
low-key fellow. Very friendly. Big little,

07:31.403 --> 07:36.248
normal sized man as I remember. One big man on 
campus was Ike Ashburn. And he officed down in the,

07:40.994 --> 07:59.655
what we called

07:40.994 --> 07:59.655
the, we called it the, not the system building, I 
forget now what we called it, the beautiful Greek,

07:59.770 --> 08:01.852
The one down east, on the east side? Okay, in the new 
Jack Williams building. It will be. That's

08:05.076 --> 08:07.399
correct. But Ike Ashburn was... Do you remember 
what his task was? Well, he was sort of a PR man, an

08:13.146 --> 08:18.192
administrative assistant of a type. The guy must 
have weighed 300 pounds. He was just a huge fellow.

08:22.697 --> 08:27.503
He had an office in Austin and was in charge of Texas 
roadways or something. He was a politician of a

08:27.923 --> 08:29.305
type. But he was a great favorite, and he taught a 
course, a one hour course to seniors on nothing.

08:38.430 --> 08:41.835
And you made an A in it. I mean, it just was one of 
those giveaways, the only giveaway I remember.

08:47.804 --> 08:50.228
And he attended various things. For example, I was 
the master of ceremonies at the senior ring dance.

08:56.257 --> 08:58.380
And when I introduced him, I said, Our next guest is 
living evidence that an army travels on its

08:59.221 --> 09:05.531
stomach. It is with pleasure I present to you 
Colonel Ike Ashburn. Everybody just roared,

09:09.898 --> 09:13.223
including Ike. Oh, great. He stood up and came to 
the mic, and he said, Anybody as big as I am that made

09:15.447 --> 09:27.085
a speech on an occasion like this ought to have 
things thrown at you. So thank you very much for the

09:27.554 --> 09:29.837
invitation. And he went over and sat down. So 
everybody got a big kick out of it. But I said,

09:34.844 --> 09:39.691
living evidence, proof that an army travels on its 
own. But he was known as Colonel Ike. Was the

09:43.957 --> 09:45.299
commandant important? Oh, yeah. The commandant 
and the professor of military science and tactics

09:46.661 --> 09:51.228
were different, too. Who was the commandant?

09:55.994 --> 09:57.156
Colonel George F. Moore. was there and he left at 
the end of my junior year and a fella came and took

09:57.828 --> 10:08.965
his place my senior year and everybody hated his 
guts. George Moore, George F. Moore was an Aggie,

10:09.767 --> 10:14.254
class of 23, something like that. Later became a 
major general and was on Corregidor. Where?

10:21.084 --> 10:23.328
George F. Moore. The Commandant just performed 
ministerial functions and had nothing to do

10:26.330 --> 10:31.256
really with the military.

10:33.840 --> 10:42.851
Let's see, student indulgences, court trips, a 
typical Aggie football day in College Station, or

10:33.840 --> 10:42.851
maybe football weekend. Well, you had the 
practice on Friday night, went to class Saturday,

10:43.572 --> 10:54.126
oftentimes got out at noon time, and you just 
walked over to the ballpark and The freshmen sat

10:54.629 --> 11:00.315
down at the bottom and back of them the sophomores 
and back of them the juniors and back of them the

10:54.629 --> 11:00.315
seniors. Wait, the freshmen sat nearest the 
field? Yes. They stood nearest the field. That's

11:05.821 --> 11:06.541
right. The sophomores standing in back of them and 
then the juniors and then the seniors. Did y'all

11:09.885 --> 11:10.786
march in? No. Did the band march in? Maybe. What 
about halftime? Always marched. Describe, make

11:21.337 --> 11:24.400
believe I'd never seen an Aggie band at halftime 
about this farmed up at the north end of the field

11:24.869 --> 11:50.590
like they do today and and marched what what jazz 
what jazz and rock music did they play none of

11:24.869 --> 11:50.590
course oh and in those days you see the first 
reveille was there oh hey describe the first rebel

11:24.869 --> 11:50.590
okay she was just a dog a mongrel dog What color?

11:55.766 --> 11:56.166
Brown.

11:59.430 --> 12:03.996
She was there when I got there, but she'd only been 
there a couple of years as I recall. The story is

12:04.757 --> 12:06.640
really sort of hazy. Somewhere or another she was 
injured, and Corman coming back from a weekend

12:07.160 --> 12:16.392
trip someplace, either saw her get hurt or caused 
her to be hurt or whatever out in the roadway, and

12:16.844 --> 12:24.651
they brought her back to Constitution. I know that 
she was there when I got there, and she'd been there

12:24.671 --> 12:29.516
about two or three years, but no longer. She was not 
kept by a unit. She was an 800-pound gorilla. She

12:40.666 --> 12:45.771
did what she wanted to do, and she seemed to know. 
which beds were occupied by freshmen. Because if

12:50.234 --> 12:57.341
she came into a room and got into a freshman's bed, 
he got out. And she also ate at Sabisa. Now, were

13:04.067 --> 13:05.368
there other dogs? No. No. And she marched with the 
band, not on a leash. And that band, she went and

13:13.836 --> 13:16.078
made court trips. And that band would be out there 
and they would each say, just counter march. And

13:21.856 --> 13:28.364
she's right there in the middle of them and never 
interfered with a single marcher. Did she bark at

13:28.384 --> 13:30.787
the right times? Yes. She was spoiled a lot. But she 
marched with the band and never interfered with

13:35.113 --> 13:39.799
anybody. When the new part of the campus, Queen 
Mudd Junior, what we called it the new area, now the

13:39.859 --> 13:46.808
quad, When the band went over there, the band had a 
responsibility for her own courthouse. And so

13:52.468 --> 13:56.131
they took her over there to the new area. And she 
stayed not one night because it was a new area to

13:56.151 --> 14:00.835
her. So she came back to the old area. And did she 
sleep in a... In wherever she wanted to. And was it

14:09.023 --> 14:10.484
quite often different? Yes, but over in the old 
area. She spent an awful lot of time around the Y.

14:15.669 --> 14:16.930
That was very familiar to her. Law and Furrier and 
Mitchell and Hart. If you could guess about her

14:21.219 --> 14:25.605
ancestry, type of dog, what do you think? A mix of 
goodness knows what. I really don't know. I really

14:29.351 --> 14:30.072
don't know. No, she was a medium-sized dog. And she 
was just spoiled rotten. She'd just look at you.

14:40.727 --> 14:41.629
Come here, Red. Come here, Red. I'm sorry I 
interrupted you. Thanks. It works okay. Thanks.

14:47.856 --> 14:54.024
The yells, you all stood during the game. Were 
yells similar then to now? Yes. Most of the yells

14:58.910 --> 15:00.211
were the same. They've got some different ones 
now. Were there some that were done then maybe in

15:01.913 --> 15:06.419
bad taste? No. OK. No. And none of this beat the hell 
out of that. We tried when they started doing that.

15:12.417 --> 15:18.603
When I say we, a number of us, me and him, spoke to 
them and suggested they abandon Yale. They just

15:18.623 --> 15:19.985
thumbed their nose at us. Well, and I tried to tell 
them, too, that's a vulgar gesture. It really is,

15:23.168 --> 15:26.291
and they know what it is. And I remember when it 
started. I remember. We tried to discourage it,

15:28.974 --> 15:32.057
and they paid no attention to it. But we didn't have 
that yell. We used to when a substitution was

15:34.159 --> 15:38.503
different in those days. A player came out like 
Marion Pugh now was a quarterback, and we'd say,

15:38.956 --> 15:48.509
we'd spell it out.

15:50.192 --> 15:52.175
A-U-G-H, Pugh, Pugh, Pugh. So if somebody had 
played well, they'd spell her name out. All right,

15:57.362 --> 16:03.691
when the game was over, and... Crashman went after 
the elevator. And where did they get thrown? They

16:05.233 --> 16:06.735
got thrown in... There was some place close to 
Military Walk. Yeah, the north end of Military

16:12.237 --> 16:15.902
Walk near Sabisa, I think. I guess, yeah. Fish 
Pond, they called it. Of the various...

16:23.270 --> 16:26.033
I'll tell you another thing that happened. This 
also happened even after the war. We picked up the

16:28.596 --> 16:31.980
visiting football team, carried them off the 
field. Oh, but not in anger, but you mean carried

16:34.070 --> 16:37.394
him off on his shoulders. That's right. That's 
right. Bear Bryant, he said that's what

16:40.217 --> 16:45.823
influenced him to leave Kentucky and come to A&M. 
Kentucky came over there and played, and they

16:46.304 --> 16:53.592
picked up his football team and carried him off the 
field. We've always been the best sportsmen when

16:53.612 --> 17:03.283
the other side's song is being sung, and none of 
this business of running out on a field while he and

16:53.612 --> 17:03.283
him are singing. Those things still anger me to 
this day, and they're deliberate, absolutely

17:03.753 --> 17:09.501
deliberate. But

17:09.541 --> 17:18.874
we used to win the sportsmanship award year after 
year after year because we were great sportsmen.

17:18.894 --> 17:22.199
What were some of your football game memories? Oh, 
well, you see, we were national champions when I

17:22.339 --> 17:26.686
was there. Which games do you remember with 
greatest joy? Every one of my junior and all but one

17:30.271 --> 17:33.355
of my senior years. I remember of course the first 
game I ever saw at Kyle Field A&M played Sam Houston

17:34.887 --> 17:46.306
and Dick Todd was running back and took the 
kickoff. Ran for a touchdown, first time I ever saw

17:47.688 --> 17:52.095
him touch the ball. Played a little bit for the 
Washington Redskins after that. My junior year,

17:57.304 --> 18:01.030
you see, we won everything.

18:02.377 --> 18:12.271
And went out and played Tulane in the Sugar Bowl and 
won that game and were 19, national champion in

18:02.377 --> 18:12.271
1939. Then 1940, 41, we won nine games in a row. And 
we were going on to the Rose Bowl, just Austin stood

18:15.976 --> 18:19.621
in the way. Cuz in those days they didn't have that 
contract between the Big Ten and the Pac-10. And we

18:26.991 --> 18:31.978
were on our way to the Rose Bowl, and we got beat 
seven to nothing in Austin. They scored on the

18:32.802 --> 18:36.146
third play of the game, and that was the only score 
in the game. And it was a sad, sad day. We didn't

18:40.071 --> 18:44.516
leave the stands after the game, and the band was 
playing taps. And those damn T-7s came down there

18:45.637 --> 18:49.562
and interrupted the thing. Could easily have had a 
fight right then and there. Among the football

18:54.828 --> 18:57.932
players, did you have some favorite 
acquaintances? Not really. Jim Thomason. was

19:02.080 --> 19:05.783
active in the Corps, I believe was a cadet major.

19:08.966 --> 19:13.510
My senior year, one of the freshmen in my outfit was 
named Martin Ruby. He played pro ball. They just

19:18.054 --> 19:24.319
sort of led their own lives separately, but Jim 
Thomason was the fullback. And he was in the Corps.

19:29.383 --> 19:31.345
I remember Chip Rowder, you see, Kimbrough, 
classmate. Willie Conacher, classmate. Marion

19:38.096 --> 19:40.518
Pugh, classmate. Chip Rout, classmate. Marshall 
Robinette, classmate. Joe Boyd was in the class of

19:44.303 --> 19:45.905
40. He was a great favorite with the Colts. He was a 
nice guy. Turned out to be a Baptist preacher. But

19:53.033 --> 19:56.677
they were sort of... Did athletes go to class? I 
don't know what they did. Did they graduate? I

19:59.721 --> 20:00.842
don't know what they did. I think they did in those 
days. I think they did. Let's see. You went to

20:07.302 --> 20:13.713
commencements, but you didn't get to go to your 
own. Did you go to some the first three years? Yeah.

20:19.984 --> 20:27.336
Were there any important campus visitors, big 
name visitors you remember seeing or hearing?

20:33.678 --> 20:38.485
Other than military people, I don't remember any. 
I really don't. There was no white electors

20:42.852 --> 20:47.740
series, special MSC functions. No, and the 
president didn't come, and John Nance Garner

20:47.800 --> 20:52.166
didn't come. He could have, but I don't remember 
it, and I rather doubt it. Yeah, Pershing didn't

20:56.052 --> 20:57.414
come. No, not that I'm aware of. Let's see. As 
you're preparing to leave the campus and

21:02.804 --> 21:12.459
following your graduation, what sort of world did 
you think you were entering? What did you think was

21:12.519 --> 21:13.841
it? Well, I just knew that war was imminent. And 
sure enough, in six months, Pearl Harbor

21:18.349 --> 21:23.196
happened. And on my 2015, I can remember looking at 
it. I can see it today on this occupation student.

21:32.268 --> 21:50.150
So five years later, when I had an opportunity to 
integrate in the regular army before the war

21:32.268 --> 21:50.150
started, then when I came back from the Pacific, I 
would extend another invitation to integrate in

21:32.268 --> 21:50.150
the regular army, and I turned that down. And then I 
had a third time later to do it, and I turned that

21:50.170 --> 21:53.794
down. Even the President of the United States 
offered me the Undersecretary of the Army's job,

21:53.854 --> 22:01.464
which I turned down when I sat on the Federal Trade 
Commission. All right. How, as you left with the

22:02.069 --> 22:13.905
possibility of war, how well prepared did you 
think you were for that responsibility? Well, I

22:13.925 --> 22:15.127
thought I could do anything. Hell, I was 21 years 
old and second lieutenant, single. I was ready to

22:20.253 --> 22:21.695
go fight the Japanese. I was madder than hell after 
Pearl Harbor. The whole country was mad. What's

22:25.761 --> 22:26.402
the difference? We had identified enemies. 
Hitler and Hirohito. and told Joe who rode a white

22:32.393 --> 22:35.618
horse that he was going to ride his horse down 
Pennsylvania. Well he never did. He never did. See

22:39.483 --> 22:43.208
today's young people don't understand that at 
all. And also because we really haven't had a war

22:44.230 --> 22:49.738
for a long time. Even Vietnam was minute compared 
to World War II. Yeah, the Korean War. But it was

22:54.925 --> 22:55.786
different. And so that we are farther now from 
World War II than you and I were from the

23:00.575 --> 23:06.941
Spanish-American War. See, because it's 42, 
three years from the Spanish-American War to the

23:06.961 --> 23:12.506
Second World War. All right, now we're 52 years 
from World War II. Let's see. There were some

23:21.574 --> 23:27.980
interviews that had taken place on the campus for 
civilian jobs. I was interviewed by... an

23:30.646 --> 23:32.589
insurance company, and somebody else. I can't 
remember now. But, of course, when the orders

23:34.351 --> 23:42.121
came, I was delighted.

23:42.141 --> 23:53.617
Getting out of A&M and not having to go out into the 
civilian world, which the country's still in

23:42.141 --> 23:53.617
depression, would have been a tough, tough thing 
to do. And it just was made easy with this military

23:53.637 --> 23:59.725
order. As you left, what were your financial 
resources? Well, I had none. I had none. I borrowed

24:08.566 --> 24:16.573
$100 my freshman year from this one man, and $100 my 
sophomore year from this same man. Then the Rotary

24:16.593 --> 24:24.921
Club had a program where you could borrow $200, but 
only juniors and seniors. So I borrowed $200 my

24:24.941 --> 24:28.024
junior year and $200 my senior year. Of course I 
worked in the summer, but I had nothing. I had no

24:32.612 --> 24:33.533
car. But Bryan Motor Company, they were a Ford 
dealer, said that they would give you a thousand

24:35.335 --> 24:54.339
dollar graduation present if you were going on 
active duty. And it could be used as a down payment

24:59.223 --> 25:02.007
for a Ford automobile. So I went to Bryan Motor 
Company and I got a Ford Club Coupe, they called it.

25:10.420 --> 25:12.683
A sporty kind of a vehicle, first car I ever owned. 
Never had one growing up, family didn't have one,

25:13.885 --> 25:18.511
mother didn't. And they found the car cost $972. 
Really it was $1,072, but it cost $972. And I went to

25:30.037 --> 25:46.198
what was called the United States Automobile 
Association at the time, USAA, and

25:30.037 --> 25:46.198
got some insurance on the car. And the motor and the 
Ford company made arrangements for us to get a

25:47.439 --> 25:52.105
monthly loan. I forget the payments were $30 a 
month, something like that. The second

25:55.970 --> 25:59.655
lieutenant didn't make a whole lot of money, $125 a 
month. cost $18 a month for subsistence, and yet

26:00.884 --> 26:07.133
your regimental officer's club cost $30 a month. 
But nevertheless, the money was pretty scarce. It

26:11.179 --> 26:15.245
was tougher than hell, as a matter of fact. A first 
lieutenant made $166.67. Don't ask me why that

26:18.049 --> 26:23.197
was, but that was a whole lot more than a second 
lieutenant made. A captain made $200.

26:27.042 --> 26:28.765
A major $270.

26:31.293 --> 26:33.275
The lieutenant colonel, $310 a month. Now,

26:33.415 --> 26:44.048
when you graduated, did you still owe those loans, 
that money? Sure. So in the summer, you had had a

26:45.209 --> 26:49.694
job, but you hadn't made enough to pay off those 
loans. That's right. When did you pay them off? As

26:52.998 --> 26:56.082
soon as I started drawing $125 a month. First thing 
I did was pay them. I don't owe any of them today, as

26:57.704 --> 27:00.507
we sit and talk. I owe no man. How do you feel in 
hindsight about that man that loaned you that

27:02.755 --> 27:06.942
money? Well, forever grateful, because he was no 
relation. He just had a big printing company, and I

27:11.009 --> 27:18.982
lived in a house about two blocks from his printing 
plant, so it was something less than River Oaks. As

27:19.363 --> 27:25.633
a matter of fact, I lived two blocks from the 
railroad tracks, and his man's name was Loudon.

27:26.423 --> 27:34.951
and the printing company whose name was Stafford 
Loudon and his son, and I graduated from the same

27:26.423 --> 27:34.951
high school at the same time. And I just went to him 
and told him I wanted to go to college, and I had no

27:36.872 --> 27:43.638
way. And he wanted to, at the end of the year, he 
wanted to see the report cards. So I reported to

27:52.186 --> 27:53.407
him. He wanted to know what I was doing, what was 
going on. I'm sure I was not the only one, but I never

27:56.579 --> 28:00.064
knew if there were others. Because you never hear 
anything like that from him. Did you sign a

28:02.608 --> 28:04.891
contract? No. No. No, signed nothing. Did he lend 
money only to Aggies? I have no idea what his

28:11.060 --> 28:13.563
activities were. I never asked. Doesn't sound 
like there's any ulterior motive on his part at

28:16.367 --> 28:19.391
all. None. Did you pay him interest? No. No. Just 
paid him the $100. Let's jump back. The student

28:30.022 --> 28:37.410
body at that time, how diverse was it in the 
background of the students?

28:42.516 --> 28:52.287
Mostly

28:42.516 --> 28:52.287
middle class America, I would say, and lower 
middle class. From big cities, country, towns,

28:54.646 --> 28:57.429
what? Mostly from the country, small towns.

29:02.816 --> 29:08.503
It was not until post-World War II that we ever got a 
graduate from Memorial High School near Houston.

29:08.523 --> 29:10.686
I remember the first one. Did, were there- San 
Antonio was a big A&M town. Were there any Hispanic

29:15.792 --> 29:17.654
students?

29:21.559 --> 29:24.062
A few, but mostly from foreign countries. Okay, 
and how were they treated? Very well. We had some

29:28.652 --> 29:31.076
from Puerto Rico. I had a Puerto Rican in my outfit, 
Francisco Salvador Palantaba. Did you all have a

29:38.026 --> 29:41.631
nickname for those Hispanics? No. Were there any 
Jewish students? Yes. How were they treated? Very

29:45.416 --> 29:46.037
well. Were there any nicknames for them? No, not 
that I'm aware of. I just can remember at the

29:50.553 --> 30:00.523
announcement at Evening Mess, once a month the 
Hillel Club would meet and somebody would comment

29:50.553 --> 30:00.523
about it. So you don't forget you got a meeting 
tonight. To that extent there was, but you never

30:05.468 --> 30:08.491
would say it to me. There were no Jewish boys in 
Miami. Were there any Asian, students of Asian

30:10.073 --> 30:13.136
ancestry? Yeah, there were a couple of Japs there 
when we were there. One in a farming family down

30:17.553 --> 30:20.596
here close to Houston. Do you remember the name? I 
did at one time, but I've forgotten it now. Was it

30:27.982 --> 30:29.544
Kishi? I don't remember. Let me turn it off. You 
said there were two Japanese? Yes, I can't

30:36.290 --> 30:37.551
remember. One was a great favorite. You don't 
remember any Chinese? Not a single one. Middle

30:44.798 --> 30:45.939
Eastern? No. Did it matter that a student was 
Catholic? I don't think it made any difference to

30:53.146 --> 30:57.231
anybody what their religion was or their faith. 
All right, that's where I wanted to hit. Why? Well,

30:59.413 --> 31:00.094
I don't know. Maybe it was... What determined a 
student's importance among other students?

31:08.524 --> 31:15.993
Whether he was a senior or a junior or a sophomore, 
if you were a freshman. Let me tell you. A&M is the

31:16.784 --> 31:18.754
most democratic institute. The Army is very 
democratic. I can't tell you how many times I've

31:20.904 --> 31:25.225
come out.
