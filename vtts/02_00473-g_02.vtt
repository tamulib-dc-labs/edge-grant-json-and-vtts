WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:10.625
from Hawaii, from storage in Oakland, from 
Homestead where my last duty station in the states

00:01.634 --> 00:10.625
were. And we were able to do that. And then after 
that you had one year, you could have one free move

00:14.150 --> 00:27.005
and one government expense within the next year, 
within one year period after you retire. And I

00:28.167 --> 00:29.869
retired on on the first of September. Well, our 
youngest daughter, we thought we were going to get

00:34.552 --> 00:46.843
a job up in Denver, take a job up in Denver, so she 
enrolled in the University of Colorado to be close

00:34.552 --> 00:46.843
at home. So she had to go up there, be there by the 
31st of August. So I got my retired papers and the

00:54.970 --> 01:00.615
retired identification and what have you. ahead 
of time so when I actually retired I was

01:01.540 --> 01:12.574
approaching Lowry Field in Denver where we were 
staying to deliver our daughter up to college. And

01:14.075 --> 01:29.995
so I went over to the BX and the base exchange to get a 
check cashed and they said oh we don't, the same day

01:14.075 --> 01:29.995
that I retired some guy said oh we don't cash checks 
for retired people here. And I said, well, I'll go

01:30.734 --> 01:32.557
to the officer's club. Well, no, the officer's 
club didn't retire, didn't cash checks for

01:32.577 --> 01:39.410
retired people either. And boy, just one day you 
can cash a check anywhere in the world, the next day

01:40.231 --> 01:50.250
you couldn't cash a check on base. So... So that 
really shakes you up. I mean, that really shakes

01:54.775 --> 01:56.878
you up. Especially after you've lived 30 years as a 
volunteer. Yeah, that's right. And so I called up

02:00.302 --> 02:03.586
the base commander up there. He was a friend of 
mine.

02:07.510 --> 02:11.675
He graduated, I guess, a couple of years ahead of me 
at West Point. And he was a major general up there.

02:14.178 --> 02:16.120
So I called him up. And I said, Chuck, what goes on 
here? I can't even get a check cast. Oh, he says, we

02:22.102 --> 02:28.151
have so many bounce checks from retired people, 
why we just have to stop this. Bounce checks from

02:29.292 --> 02:31.295
retired people? That's what he said. How can that 
be? Well, they go into the transit, well, he said

02:33.718 --> 02:39.867
transit retired people. They're traveling 
around the United States, and they stop at an air

02:39.967 --> 02:47.438
base and cash a check, and the doggone thing 
bounces. Mm-hmm. For various reasons. You know,

02:49.813 --> 03:00.307
you're retired, your checking account's not 
fully moved, and all of a sudden your pay is

02:49.813 --> 03:00.307
involved, getting to you on time. So what did the 
commander say? Oh, he said, go back to the

03:03.090 --> 03:09.899
officer's club, and I'll call them up and clear it 
for me. Clear it with them so that you can cash the

03:09.959 --> 03:12.303
check. Well, yes, that solves the problem. But 
it's really a shock at that time. And then your

03:19.190 --> 03:33.443
other problems that you have in retiring, you're 
being in very responsible jobs, and you're a

03:19.190 --> 03:33.443
really capable individual. And this applies to a 
lot of people in the military. And then they go out

03:37.147 --> 03:46.716
and looking for a job, and no one in civilian life 
can equate the job you did in the military to a job

03:47.337 --> 03:55.289
that they have available in the industry or the 
educational field or what have you. I was

03:55.369 --> 03:58.134
interested in getting into a university. And 
teaching? Teaching or being an administrative

04:01.699 --> 04:10.894
assistant or comptroller in the administrative 
field. Not necessarily in teaching. You can get a

04:13.598 --> 04:15.100
job in teaching. having had a master's degree and 
all the experience. They were willing to give me a

04:20.762 --> 04:25.369
job in teaching. Who was this? Well, I went to see 
President of the University of Houston,

04:27.351 --> 04:37.545
President of Tate at SMU. I wrote to the the various 
college associations

04:43.784 --> 04:51.777
in the southeast. I

04:51.797 --> 05:07.142
went

04:51.797 --> 05:07.142
up to the University of Texas and talked to the 
president up there. But they really weren't

05:07.797 --> 05:09.259
interested. Here you are, 55 years old. They said, 
we're interested in a guy that's 25 years old who

05:11.120 --> 05:15.585
has a future. I'll just face it. You are 55, and 10 
years, you're going to have to retire anyway, all

05:17.087 --> 05:23.654
over again. So we take you two years to train you. We 
only get eight years of productivity out of you.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.662
Whereas here's a young man. that we train in for two 
years, we have twenty-five years or thirty years

05:32.148 --> 05:36.853
of productivity. That must have really been 
frustrating for you. Oh yeah, well. And then you

05:41.779 --> 05:50.628
got into the job corps program and you said, well, 
they won't even interview you.

05:55.374 --> 05:58.157
So you started working at banks. I said, well, I'll 
take that. being an executive of a bank, why you

06:01.713 --> 06:11.210
should be able to get a job in the bank, being a loan 
officer or something of this sort. Well, you know,

06:11.771 --> 06:17.140
the banks won't even talk to you.

06:17.180 --> 06:26.877
The only thing that you would get through the banks 
is companies that they had big loans with that were

06:17.180 --> 06:26.877
having problems of paying them. They want you to go 
out and collect. Yeah, no, they want you to go out

06:29.011 --> 06:40.145
and get in there and get the things straightened 
out so that the outfit won't go bankrupt and

06:29.011 --> 06:40.145
protect their investment. And you don't blame 
them.

06:45.672 --> 06:46.613
So you were depressed. Yeah, you're depressed. 
What were your feelings when you left Hawaii,

06:49.897 --> 06:52.600
which was your last post? Well, I mean, I was... I 
was, I mean I didn't, being the fact that you

06:57.012 --> 07:08.869
weren't going to get promoted by, I was ready to 
retire and try something new. And you figured with

07:11.092 --> 07:14.737
the experience you had you should be able to get a 
pretty good job.

07:17.721 --> 07:19.864
And you were offered, I guess I was offered

07:22.342 --> 07:34.697
at the time as good jobs as you expect, except you 
probably expect more than

07:22.342 --> 07:34.697
people really willing to give you as an unknown.

07:36.960 --> 07:43.388
The National Security Agency has some contracts 
for some cryptological equipment that they had a

07:43.773 --> 08:00.761
company that was way behind in production and of 
course they knew me so they were promoting me to go

07:43.773 --> 08:00.761
into that company and take over the production 
part of it. And I could have gotten that job. Why

08:05.128 --> 08:05.949
didn't you take it? Where was it? It was in 
Maryland. in around Baltimore, Maryland

08:11.279 --> 08:14.362
someplace. Well, you went up and talked to the 
President, of course the National Security

08:16.184 --> 08:24.012
Agency didn't have a lot of leverage.

08:27.075 --> 08:32.881
And they said, yeah, we'll give you a job, you'll be 
the executive assistant of Mr. Brown. And then you

08:32.921 --> 08:37.506
look at Mr. Brown and maybe he's twenty-five years 
old. He said, well, can I work for him? I mean, you

08:40.083 --> 08:44.329
have to look at it as being his administrative 
assistant. Well, looking back, that's the only

08:44.749 --> 08:52.679
way that you probably could get a job, starting out 
as an administrative assistant. And then after

08:52.699 --> 09:00.989
showing your colors over a period of a year or so, 
you'd fit into the management side. But when

09:01.049 --> 09:07.577
you're retiring, and when you retire in positions 
without help, why you were just in a hurry. You just

09:12.692 --> 09:23.729
weren't particularly interested in starting out 
at $18,000,

09:12.692 --> 09:23.729
$20,000 in a low-level job. The pay was all

09:24.570 --> 09:32.282
right. Looking back, you'd probably say, OK, I'll 
just give you six months for free. I'll just live

09:37.923 --> 09:40.606
off my retired pay in six months. And then at the end 
of six months, we'll be able to decide what job I can

09:40.627 --> 09:51.800
have and what the pay will be

09:40.627 --> 09:51.800
and what the benefits are. So then I worked at this 
retirement thing. rather thoroughly. Do you

10:02.761 --> 10:18.878
think your disappointment at these low level 
offers and the fact that you had been commander of a

10:02.761 --> 10:18.878
lot of responsibility, is this the reason why you 
decided to build your own company? Well I decided I

10:20.139 --> 10:27.987
was going to want to get involved in a small company 
and of course we had not a lot of savings. You don't

10:29.894 --> 10:32.037
make a lot of money in the military. And as I would 
say that we had bought real estate and when I

10:33.279 --> 10:54.167
retired I think we had three houses that one of them 
was paid off and worth about $15,000 and we had one

10:33.279 --> 10:54.167
in Washington that was oh we probably had another 
$15,000 equity in it. So you ended up raising maybe

10:54.628 --> 10:57.872
$35,000 or $40,000 but you also had two dollars in 
college and that was taking around $15,000 a year

10:58.713 --> 11:06.060
out of your savings.

11:09.404 --> 11:17.412
So I figured that I had about $15,000 to

11:09.404 --> 11:17.412
get into a small company. You should talk to my wife 
about our searching for small companies because

11:19.254 --> 11:28.163
we went to Del Rio and we advertised in Wall Street 
Journal. And we got a lot of

11:28.835 --> 11:39.685
replies of companies that were interested in 
selling out. And we had a, there was a bottling

11:39.705 --> 11:49.013
company, a PepsiCo bottling company in Del Rio 
that was supposed to be making a lot of money and

11:39.705 --> 11:49.013
very good. But you go down and look at it and the guy 
owner was living in a trailer on the site. You look

11:53.978 --> 11:57.441
at the equipment and it was very obvious it was 
maybe thirty, forty, fifty years old and you had

11:58.096 --> 12:04.324
dirty balls all over the place. It just didn't give 
you the impression that it was a very lucrative

12:04.364 --> 12:13.415
place to come to take over. Then we went over to some 
small company manufacturing horse trailers,

12:14.377 --> 12:25.791
cattle trailer, horse trailer type of thing. And 
they were willing to sell out for about forty

12:26.530 --> 12:37.063
thousand dollars and of course you looked them 
over and you really weren't very impressed. It was

12:37.524 --> 12:51.542
a little small town about fifteen hundred people 
that they were building and they were building

12:37.524 --> 12:51.542
good product but supposedly they were selling 
horse traders from here to Florida.

12:52.417 --> 12:56.161
And so we didn't, weren't impressed there. And 
then we went up to another balling company in

12:56.181 --> 13:02.188
Temple, Texas and that was a pretty good looking 
company.

13:05.672 --> 13:07.214
Orange Crush I think it was. And they had Delaware 
Punch I think was another. And that wasn't too

13:13.541 --> 13:18.407
impressive. But are these the typical types of 
problems that a general will have when he retires,

13:19.282 --> 13:25.428
do you think? Well, I think that you have two, no, 
you probably have two different types of

13:26.209 --> 13:32.115
problems. One of them is the general is not going 
to, don't expect to do anything. The general

13:37.160 --> 13:39.422
himself doesn't expect to do anything? Yeah, he 
doesn't want to do anything. I mean, just like a

13:40.603 --> 13:48.411
friend of mine who was,

13:40.603 --> 13:48.411
who was, Oh, I guess he was five years my senior. He 
retired in Austin. Well, the first thing he did was

13:55.240 --> 14:02.049
go to enroll in the University of Texas to get the VA 
benefits. I think he just took any courses, the

14:02.069 --> 14:07.858
easiest courses there. But so he runs his VA 
benefits out on that. Well, by this time, he was...

14:18.597 --> 14:22.362
62 or what the minimum age to get Social Security. 
So he starts drawing Social Security. So he gets

14:24.525 --> 14:26.889
his retired pay plus Social Security. He draws his 
GI Bill. And so I wrote him a letter when I was

14:32.016 --> 14:37.824
getting ready to retire and asked for his 
suggestion. He said, well, do nothing and wait

14:37.844 --> 14:47.558
around all day for 4 o'clock for cocktail hour.

14:48.297 --> 14:55.870
And obviously Anthony said, well the first year he 
started drawing Social Security, he drew all that

14:48.297 --> 14:55.870
he had ever paid in there. So since he was 
sixty-four, why he had been a freeloader on the

14:56.290 --> 15:05.045
Social Security system. To me this is a is stealing 
almost. Although I agree he's due it, but that's

15:11.389 --> 15:17.957
not really what Social Security was set up for. So 
that's the first problem, people who the general

15:18.658 --> 15:23.944
just looks out and says, well, I'm not going to do 
anything. And the other problem is someone like

15:24.024 --> 15:29.411
you who wants to do something but cannot find a job. 
They really cannot find a job. Then, of course, you

15:32.154 --> 15:39.043
have certain other selected general officers who 
who have been in contact with the big industrial

15:39.614 --> 15:52.813
complexes that get a job with the companies with 
whom they've been dealing. Sure, there's a number

15:52.853 --> 15:58.902
of generals and admirals who work for Boeing and 
General Dynamics. And Bell and all this type of

15:58.962 --> 16:02.187
thing. And I got in contact with some of those 
people.

16:10.765 --> 16:21.056
And some of them are happy and have a very 
responsible job, and others were hired just

16:10.765 --> 16:21.056
because they knew who they knew in the Air Force or 
who they knew in the military. And they were real

16:21.076 --> 16:32.747
unhappy with their jobs that they were doing, 
although- They were basically contact men to try

16:21.076 --> 16:32.747
to influence the current leadership in the 
military to buy their goods. That's right.

16:38.238 --> 16:57.185
And you're in a poor position because see 
according to the regulations and rules and

16:38.238 --> 16:57.185
regulations it says a regular retired officer 
that you can't have a job that requires you to

16:38.238 --> 16:57.185
contact these people. Now they can come out to see 
you and

16:57.245 --> 17:05.697
I presume there's some some communication 
between them whether or not it's legal or not

17:06.453 --> 17:11.198
legal. But the fact that General Jones is working 
for Northrop why then you would not contact him or

17:12.340 --> 17:35.346
if you went out to visit that particular company 
why you'd probably go out and have cocktails with

17:35.883 --> 17:37.966
him and things of this sort. I mean it's just a 
natural set up. But it's retiring from one career

17:45.619 --> 18:00.743
to the next is I would say quite shocking.

18:00.976 --> 18:03.679
Because you don't know, it's one of these 
unknowns. You're at a 55-year-old age. You have a

18:08.185 --> 18:15.033
wife and kids to take care of. You have a retired pay 
that's, I'll say, about half of what you were

18:15.854 --> 18:23.062
getting on active duty. And although

18:24.004 --> 18:30.291
financially, I was in a pretty good position. I 
should have probably just sat around for six

18:31.064 --> 18:42.634
months and let the world go by and start out then, 
but I was in a hurry. Well, let's stop here. All

18:47.518 --> 18:47.899
right. Now you've been in positions of leadership 
in the military and in civilian life right now.

18:58.948 --> 19:00.750
Could you, I know that you've talked on this. Like 
you told me earlier, you've given speeches on

19:04.172 --> 19:08.380
leadership before. You have Air Force manuals on 
it. You have a whole file cabinet on it. Could you

19:12.427 --> 19:16.514
just give me a definition of leadership? Well, I 
think it's the ability to get people to work for

19:16.534 --> 19:22.705
you. You read your Air Force manual real well then 
because that's what it says in here too. It says,

19:29.653 --> 19:38.027
Leadership is the art of influencing people to 
progress with cooperation and enthusiasm toward

19:29.653 --> 19:38.027
the accomplishment of a mission. That sounds like 
very good.

19:43.696 --> 19:49.806
Do you think that there's a difference between 
leadership in civilian and in military?

19:52.351 --> 20:14.862
Well, I think that your leadership in civilian 
industry is

19:52.351 --> 20:14.862
designed more of an objective of making money, 
either for the stockholders or what have you, than

19:52.351 --> 20:14.862
in the military. I mean, I think your military 
isn't a profit motive at all. I think the motive is

20:20.785 --> 20:25.610
to get the most bang for a buck. This is what your 
objective is as far as the military is concerned,

20:27.452 --> 20:42.166
is to keep the cost down, but to get the people 
enthused and do a better job. If you do that, then

20:44.068 --> 20:47.031
you're not paying the guy anymore. You're just 
getting a better job out of it. In the military, we

20:49.743 --> 21:00.038
have had some rather flamboyant leaders, 
dramatic leaders in the last 30 years. George

21:00.298 --> 21:07.749
Patton, people like this, the tough sort of, I 
suppose General MacArthur was in a sense like

21:00.298 --> 21:07.749
that. Tough leader out in front of his troops over 
the hill, sort of, come on guys, we'll kick you in

21:08.210 --> 21:18.585
the back seat of the pants and let's go. Do you feel 
that that type of leader is more typical in the

21:20.067 --> 21:30.396
military or other types of leaders, more of a 
manager type leader? Well I would say the

21:30.416 --> 21:38.002
Eisenhower type leader is a more typical type of 
military leader. Patton of course, he had

21:38.663 --> 21:49.112
showmanship and I tell you his people followed him 
although he got into lots of trouble of slapping

21:49.514 --> 22:07.371
kids in the hospital and this type of thing, but as 
far as the people that were in a Patton outfit, they

21:49.514 --> 22:07.371
had nothing but glory for Patton because he knew 
how to get the job done.

22:12.336 --> 22:13.858
People just followed him. They knew that he was 
going to protect them. What kind of leader was

22:17.762 --> 22:19.183
Curtis LeMay? Well, John LeMay was, I think, the 
same type of leader. He demanded perfection, and

22:23.517 --> 22:28.042
he got perfection. The guys who couldn't produce, 
well, he just got rid of them. He was brutal that

22:33.309 --> 22:34.791
way. However, only at the same time, he had a 
tremendous amount of compassion for the

22:35.732 --> 22:49.609
families, for the feelings of his people. was the 
type of leader that you knew he had to produce for.

22:55.464 --> 23:01.692
But at the same time, you knew that he was going to 
take care of your family if you got caught

22:55.464 --> 23:01.692
overseas. And that's

23:02.833 --> 23:17.672
a ‑‑ and I think that he really could get the job 
done, too, probably a lot faster than Eisenhower

23:02.833 --> 23:17.672
could get it. What kind of leader were you? Well, I 
don't know. I

23:22.588 --> 23:30.595
think I was more of the quiet type of leader. 
However, it's just like going to the military

23:31.056 --> 23:36.741
academy. If you studied hard the first six weeks of 
a semester and you got in a high grade, a high class,

23:49.377 --> 23:52.721
why then you normally made good grades there on. I 
think when you went into a base and you got real mean

23:53.182 --> 24:06.480
the first six weeks or two months or three months 
and then after that why then you could just relax

23:53.182 --> 24:06.480
and everything just went along real smoothly. As 
you know that they knew you meant business. Yeah

24:10.806 --> 24:14.110
and that you were still human and what have you. So 
you still had to take care of people Because all

24:19.634 --> 24:28.105
your, whether or not you're in civilian life or in 
military, you have to get the job done through

24:19.634 --> 24:28.105
influencing people. Okay. You said before that a 
couple of the values that a leader should have is

24:31.008 --> 24:37.276
positive attitude and enthusiasm. What are some 
of the other values that a leader should have?

24:40.520 --> 24:48.190
Well, I would say you're going to have to have 
ideas, you have to have creativity.

24:50.330 --> 24:58.977
and you have to make decisions and you have to get 
results.

24:58.997 --> 25:05.083
And you do all of that through

24:58.997 --> 25:05.083
people. And

25:06.043 --> 25:15.652
this creativity is a talent. I think you can 
develop it, but you There are so many people that

25:20.992 --> 25:25.896
don't look at a situation critically. They'll 
look at it through rose-colored glasses. I used to

25:29.580 --> 25:37.327
take my bunch of second lieutenants out around the 
school buildings and they couldn't see a

25:29.580 --> 25:37.327
cigarette butt on the ground. They just didn't see 
it. They just looked beyond it. Whereas

25:41.070 --> 25:49.598
I could see the cigarette butts on the ground so 
that you could keep the place clean. And I think

25:50.371 --> 26:03.805
that you have to look at a situation critically in

25:50.371 --> 26:03.805
order to improve the situation. And you try to 
develop that capability, but a lot of people just

26:05.026 --> 26:15.737
don't, just can't

26:17.995 --> 26:20.378
Look at the situation critically.

26:24.103 --> 26:32.955
The enthusiasm, I just think that enthusiasm, if 
you are exuberant in enthusiasm, it's catching. I

26:33.115 --> 26:43.589
think the other thing you have to do is be able to 
tell people, communicate with people as to what

26:33.115 --> 26:43.589
you want done. Because you can have the most 
brilliant ideas that you that you can find. But if

26:51.878 --> 26:58.765
you can't get people to communicate with people to 
get the job done, you still won't get the job done.

26:58.785 --> 26:59.666
Sure.

27:02.750 --> 27:08.135
In the military, how important is tolerance and 
flexibility? Well, in some cases, you just can't

27:10.318 --> 27:17.286
have flexibility and tolerance now. Just like I 
mentioned, If an individual is taking an

27:19.522 --> 27:31.980
emergency test and flying an airplane, as far as 
I'm concerned, there's no tolerance there. If it

27:32.020 --> 27:39.751
means the difference between him living and dying 
or the maintenance of his aircraft, there's no

27:32.020 --> 27:39.751
tolerance. It has to be perfect. But when you get 
away from those situations where it really

27:41.774 --> 27:47.622
doesn't make any difference, why, then you can 
very easily ask, what do you think? And then he

27:52.454 --> 27:55.399
says, well, I would do it this way. Well, if it's as 
good a way as yours, you're a lot better off by

27:55.419 --> 28:01.528
saying, okay, that sounds good. We'll do it that 
way. And in that situation why you always let him

28:04.292 --> 28:15.448
advance his ideas and if his idea is equal to yours 
or Or you can certainly say, well, that sounds

28:15.884 --> 28:20.291
good, but how about adding this to it? So you maybe 
modify his a little bit and then it's his idea, then

28:20.332 --> 28:37.841
he will do it a lot more willingly and say, and it 
would be if you say, I want it done this way and I want

28:20.332 --> 28:37.841
it done now, then he'll do it, but he'll probably 
resent for it a little. In other words, use that

28:38.823 --> 28:40.946
individual's ideas. Oh, yeah, well. This is a 
technique that we use in the technical schools

28:42.648 --> 28:50.376
when we're in the headquarters. We'd have the 
bases come in with their plan, and if we could

28:50.436 --> 28:55.201
accept them, we'd accept their plan. And then you 
would have no problem with getting the thing

28:56.081 --> 28:58.924
implemented. But if you went down with a 
directive, say, I want it done this way, this is

28:59.625 --> 29:05.191
what you'll do. Well, they might do it, but they 
still won't get it done as easily. But we always let

29:08.674 --> 29:12.638
them present their plan, and if it was acceptable 
even with smaller modifications, well you accept

29:13.023 --> 29:18.029
it. So you're a lot better off in having them 
present their plan, approve their plan, and they

29:18.429 --> 29:27.599
go back happy and they came up with a good job. It's 
very easy to do. Let's say you were going back to

29:31.664 --> 29:41.815
Texas A&M next week and you were asked to give a 
lecture to these 18-year-old 18-year-old

29:42.267 --> 29:45.070
corpsman out there on how to become a leader. What 
would you tell them? I know you've given talks on

29:48.193 --> 29:52.578
these things before. Well, I would first have them 
examine to be sure that they want to

29:52.598 --> 30:04.250
be a leader. Each individual should be sure that 
they are willing to give up what you give up when you

30:13.452 --> 30:18.360
get out in front. You're going to have to make 
decisions. Some of them are going to be unpopular.

30:24.129 --> 30:29.658
You're the boss and people won't associate with 
you.

30:36.308 --> 30:39.493
And those that do associate with you, The other 
people think that they're trying to polish the

30:39.980 --> 30:45.747
apple and what have you. So it's rather a lonely 
type of life at the man at the top, but it's not

30:45.827 --> 30:53.897
crowded at the top at all. And I've found that 
probably only 10% of the individuals, even the

30:55.359 --> 31:09.396
officers, are willing to be out in front, because 
if you're out in front, why is everybody looking at

30:55.359 --> 31:09.396
you? I mean your boss is looking at you and 
everybody below is looking at you. So you have to be

31:14.435 --> 31:17.100
sure that you want to do that. And the other thing, 
the next thing I think is if your family life is you

31:18.663 --> 31:30.625
have to live
