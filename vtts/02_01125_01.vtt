WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:30.240
Mr. Pappas,

00:02.005 --> 00:30.240
would you please tell us a little bit about your 
personal background and some of your experiences

00:02.005 --> 00:30.240
before becoming involved with Mitchell Energy 
and the Woodlands Corporation, and then explain

00:02.005 --> 00:30.240
how you happened to be here today, I suppose.

00:31.638 --> 00:33.960
First of all, I came to this country back in 1946. My 
parents were Americans. I and my younger brothers

00:36.342 --> 00:39.565
were born in Greece. And we were there during the 
war. Immediately after the war, we came back. I had

00:44.048 --> 00:45.270
finished high school there. And I went to the 
University of Missouri for my arrival back to the

00:46.511 --> 00:50.054
States. And I got a degree in civil engineering 
from there. And then they took me in the army. And I

00:59.542 --> 01:01.223
spent a couple of years in Germany. And when I came 
back, I worked in New York where I got married. And I

01:07.661 --> 01:15.974
went overseas for the employers that I worked for 
two or three times. And in 1962,

01:17.857 --> 01:26.790
I got a job with a New York developer. And they sent 
me here to Texas. And that's when I met Mr.

01:29.334 --> 01:30.636
Mitchell. Now your specialty, your work had been 
in what area as an engineer? In highway design and

01:36.252 --> 01:39.356
land development. Had you been involved in any 
major real estate or new community type projects?

01:48.008 --> 01:48.649
No. No, I had never been involved in new 
communities. Development, in fact, when we were

01:52.495 --> 01:59.965
thinking about the woodlands as a new community, 
Mr. Mitchell and I We had discussions as to how we

02:00.518 --> 02:05.364
can put a team together to do it. And he asked me 
point blank if I had done it in town before. I said,

02:12.031 --> 02:12.592
no. He said, neither have I. I said, so we're both 
going to learn together, aren't we? And we've got

02:17.377 --> 02:19.419
to pay for it, too. How did you make the Mitchell 
connection originally? How did that happen? When

02:22.643 --> 02:30.492
I came here with a developer from New York, Mr. 
Mitchell and the partner of his by the name Norman

02:22.643 --> 02:30.492
Dobbins, They were involved in housing. They had a 
company by the name of Pace Center Homes. And Mr.

02:38.166 --> 02:43.453
Dobbins was very active with the Houston Home 
Builders Association. He was the president, in

02:43.493 --> 02:46.397
fact, when I arrived here in town. What year was 
that? 1962. 1962. And

02:49.461 --> 02:59.854
as a prospective developer, the first entity that 
I knocked at its door. It was the Home Builders

03:03.183 --> 03:07.948
Association, Mr. Dobbins was the president. And 
he told me that

03:07.968 --> 03:18.038
he would be interested in knowing what we're doing 
down here as far as development is concerned. And

03:18.059 --> 03:19.640
he introduced me to Mr. Mitchell. And Mr. Mitchell 
turned around and says to me, you people have the

03:21.002 --> 03:24.746
land. I have the development or the housing 
company. And I have the oil and gas. You people have

03:33.847 --> 03:34.989
shipping. So see if you can put something together 
for us. And

03:39.175 --> 03:46.345
then we had the company I was with. We had a piece of 
property, which just immediately still is,

03:46.806 --> 03:56.360
immediately south of the Woodlands, where the 
Woodlands is today. 1,400 acres of land. And we had

03:58.357 --> 04:14.195
another 2,000 acres of land down by where

03:58.357 --> 04:14.195
Bay, oops, the big shopping center down by Webster 
Runs. Oh, near Cherry? Baybrook. Baybrook. Yeah,

04:17.779 --> 04:18.680
Baybrook Mall. OK. 2,000 acres there. And of 
course, we had about 15 acres of land across the

04:20.282 --> 04:24.607
street from the Shamrock Hotel. And that's where I 
came down here to develop. from New York. And we did

04:30.782 --> 04:46.277
an economic survey and analysis of three tracts of 
land, and with an outfit from California. And they

04:48.419 --> 04:56.427
suggested that it was quite premature for this 
tract of land south of the woodlands to be

04:48.419 --> 04:56.427
developed. If we felt like war was imminent and 
that the defense industry would be very active,

04:57.470 --> 05:12.407
then the property south of Houston, the Web 
Surround, ought to be developed. Not much of NASA

05:12.427 --> 05:14.870
was by that time. And you knew NASA was coming. Not 
when we had the money. We put the earnest money

05:18.214 --> 05:21.157
down. No, we did not launch at NASA. That was in 
August 1961. In November 1961, the NASA site was

05:27.271 --> 05:38.162
announced, and we closed the property the 23rd of 
December of the same year. Nobody did not know that

05:39.323 --> 05:43.707
NASA would be located. In any way, they told us that 
if we felt like war was imminent, that the defense

05:43.727 --> 05:56.940
contractor would be hefty, then that site down 
there would be developed. However, they felt that

05:58.135 --> 06:09.310
it would be one industry-oriented type of a site, 
and that we'd be very, very careful how we develop

05:58.135 --> 06:09.310
it. Because at any rate, at any time where the 
Defense Department felt that they were

06:09.330 --> 06:16.440
overspending themselves, they would cut it down. 
And therefore, you're going to be out. They

06:19.164 --> 06:25.813
recommended that we go ahead and develop the site 
across the street from Shamrock. However, it was

06:26.570 --> 06:30.757
not a large enough site to create an organization 
around. Yeah, that was just a couple hundred acres

06:30.917 --> 06:33.761
or something? No, that was 15 acres. Oh, I see. 43 
from Shamrock. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then I went back

06:40.592 --> 06:41.934
to New York. I developed a high-rise apartment 
building for the corporation. And then I happened

06:48.144 --> 06:52.932
to come down here on New Year's Eve party in 1966.

06:54.616 --> 07:01.864
And I, of course, I had a lot of friends by that time 
here in Houston, Mr. Dobbins, Mr. Mitchell. And I

07:01.884 --> 07:03.666
went up there to say hello to him. By that time, of 
course, he had accumulated all this land over

07:03.706 --> 07:07.751
here. And we talked to each other about moving down 
here. At the party. That's right. No, not at the

07:13.397 --> 07:14.939
party. After the party. Yeah. In fact, this 
property over here that Mr. Mitchell purchased,

07:16.861 --> 07:23.509
it was offered to us in New York. by a realtor by the 
name Weisberger, Ernest Weisberger. And I called

07:32.212 --> 07:35.196
my boss. He was in London at that time. He says, I'm 
coming home, he says, for Thanksgiving. We'll go

07:41.944 --> 07:43.586
down to Houston, have a look at the properties. By 
that time, the Mitchell had persisted. And when I

07:49.834 --> 07:54.340
came down here for the party, I went up to his office 
to see him. Congratulated him on the purchase, and

07:54.505 --> 07:59.332
we talked about it a little bit. Before I knew it, I 
came back to Houston. That's a good story. That's

08:03.137 --> 08:05.681
the way things happen. Well, they didn't, up to 
that point, they did not have a civil engineer at

08:06.242 --> 08:10.248
all. And they were doing, at that time, they were 
doing, as far as development is concerned,

08:11.009 --> 08:19.621
Pirates Beach and Pirates Falls. They were doing 
that at that time. Do you work on those projects as

08:22.565 --> 08:23.787
well? Do you work on those projects? Oh, yes, 
absolutely. And also this facility in Aspen? Yes,

08:28.800 --> 08:30.223
I work on that, too. So your responsibility is for? 
Engineering, construction, all the real estate.

08:34.773 --> 08:36.576
All the real estate, OK. For the corporation.

08:39.643 --> 08:44.172
And in 1967, June 1, I moved my rear end over here. I 
hope that, oh, you have to keep that up. We'll edit

08:52.506 --> 08:55.088
it and give it back to you. I hope the hell you leave 
it. Where did you live? Where did you move to? There

08:57.911 --> 08:58.712
was no woodland. Did you live in this vicinity? Oh, 
no. Physically? I still don't live here. Oh, you

09:02.475 --> 09:03.016
don't? No, sir. I live in Houston. And there's a 
story behind that. Yeah, I like good stories.

09:12.244 --> 09:13.265
Please do. When, well, okay. Parenthetically

09:15.337 --> 09:31.601
then, when we start putting the application for 
HUD together, back in 1970, 71, 72, 71 primarily.

09:33.024 --> 09:39.994
As I said earlier, Mr. Mitchell had never built a 
new town, neither had I. So we're going to spend

09:40.666 --> 09:49.696
some money in Water West to learn, and some other 
people, like Macalester, Jim Macalester was

09:40.666 --> 09:49.696
around at the time, some other people. So we had 
gone to Macalester. Mr. Mitchell and I were going

09:54.482 --> 09:58.727
to Columbia, Maryland. That was the first 
generation of New Towns. And from there, we went to

10:05.334 --> 10:09.559
the rest of Virginia, which was the counterpart. 
And

10:11.007 --> 10:23.080
Columbia had a population at that time about, oh, I 
would say about 7,000 to 10,000 people. And of

10:23.100 --> 10:24.301
course, Mr. Rouse, Jim Rouse, was very, very 
generous with his information. He might have

10:28.485 --> 10:35.833
instructed his key people to open up his books, you 
know, any information that he needed to go ahead

10:28.485 --> 10:35.833
and share it with us. and invited us to an open 
meeting with his employees down at Pavilion, very

10:36.944 --> 10:50.136
similar to the Cynthia Good Mitchell Pavilion 
they had there, who were his guests. I spent three,

10:51.717 --> 10:55.281
four, five days there at one time or the other. And 
what impressed me was in Colombia, of course, it

10:56.161 --> 11:06.951
was not

10:56.161 --> 11:06.951
socially, it was very active. for the small number 
of people that they had down there. We used to go to

11:09.785 --> 11:14.592
the bar that they had on the high rise by the lake 
there. And we'd see a lot of women there, men there,

11:16.454 --> 11:22.883
messing around, moving around. In discussions, 
of course, I found out that Colombia was

11:23.824 --> 11:29.672
over-planned. Colombia was planned in such a way 
as that taking all the initiative away from the

11:31.535 --> 11:36.702
individual. They had it organized such a way as the 
paint job would be done by an organization, you

11:37.593 --> 11:49.055
know, home properties. The yard would be mined in a 
certain way by the homeowners association. It was

11:57.450 --> 12:00.917
too structured. And left a lot of time in the hands 
of individuals, wives and husbands. And they,

12:08.826 --> 12:17.215
some people, although you had to pay for all the 
services. Sure. And when those costs started

12:18.257 --> 12:25.665
hitting the pocketbook, a lot of them, they could 
not necessarily be, were able to afford it. And

12:26.306 --> 12:30.010
that brought frictions and tremendous divorce 
rates. He said, in fact, I asked Mr. Ted Baker, who

12:30.344 --> 12:38.754
was the head planner for Columbia at that time, 
what the hell... That's trouble in paradise.

12:38.794 --> 12:41.898
Yeah, what the hell happened here? He says, well, I 
suggest, he says, I recommend, never live in the

12:41.918 --> 12:48.105
place where you work. That really sunk in very, 
very heavily, because 98% divorce rate, the

12:49.086 --> 12:57.516
people who work there, they start messing around 
in the same environment, you know. And they never

12:58.171 --> 13:02.295
really separated their social life from the 
business life. From the business and their family

13:02.315 --> 13:05.038
life. And really impressive. 98% divorce rate. 
That's incredible. They were all young people of

13:09.562 --> 13:11.224
course. They were all young professionals trying 
to make it. And that impressed me in the negative.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.230
That is impressive. Something what not to do over 
here. Did that idea though enter into at all the

13:21.093 --> 13:25.157
planning I wasn't really in development at all. 
Yes, it was proposed. It was set into our plan of

13:29.804 --> 13:32.106
thinking. However, more so in my own plan, my own 
family plan. But you don't want to overdo it. Yeah,

13:36.390 --> 13:37.070
sure. I see that. And I said at that time, there's a 
lot to be said about dividing or separating your

13:38.491 --> 13:48.961
social life with your business life and your 
family. That's right. And that's why I still don't

13:49.481 --> 13:51.923
. But that's a good analysis, too. And a good 
comparison of this community and the area. And of

13:56.202 --> 14:01.066
course, for the woodlands, I personally believe 
the woodlands are not over planned. I don't

14:01.486 --> 14:02.107
either. I was just wondering. It needs to be in the 
hands of the property owners to do their own thing

14:03.548 --> 14:08.232
inside and out. Yeah. For that opportunity, at 
least. Now, in the development of the terrain, the

14:13.116 --> 14:22.264
geography, the drainage, and so forth, you were 
instrumental in planning that initial

14:13.116 --> 14:22.264
development, weren't you? I'm doing it. Yes, sir. 
What is that? I haven't seen one, but if you had a job

14:24.749 --> 14:29.295
description, what would it say? Me? Yeah. I'm an 
officer in charge of engineering and

14:32.338 --> 14:35.041
construction. And that was from the beginning. 
That basically was your job description. And

14:37.985 --> 14:39.346
that's remained constant? Yes. OK. Now, what kind 
of a perception or precept or idea or goal did you

14:39.686 --> 14:51.540
have when you went into the woodlands to set this up 
as a habitable Well, we had at least, first name

14:52.415 --> 14:58.943
Henry, right? Right. We had, I would say, two or 
three years worth of very heavy interchange of

15:00.925 --> 15:12.840
ideas with consultants. We visited numerous 
sites in order to see how they were doing and what

15:12.940 --> 15:21.510
they were doing wrong. in order to have that as an 
input, at least on a large scale, to our community.

15:30.481 --> 15:33.545
From a physical plan, nothing very much changed. 
You need to provide adequate drainage in order to

15:33.706 --> 15:39.033
avoid flooding. People love to see the rain, 
sitting in their living room, rain, beautiful

15:39.614 --> 15:44.440
water. But when they start feeling the water 
through the torch going from one door through the

15:50.752 --> 15:54.176
to the other door, they don't particularly care 
for that. Yeah, a lot of the charm wears off. Sir? A

15:55.837 --> 15:57.059
lot of the charm wears off. Well, I think the 
headaches are setting in. So they do need adequate

16:01.484 --> 16:03.846
drainage. People do not necessarily want to see 
the water flow down like rivers. They don't mind

16:08.952 --> 16:12.395
seeing the water standing like that, for example, 
here. However, when the water starts getting into

16:13.016 --> 16:18.582
their homes, then the problem with that. So you 
need to provide that with drainage. Secondly,

16:21.489 --> 16:31.601
people really don't care where you get it from as 
long as every time the faucet water comes out. And

16:32.041 --> 16:34.824
more than they care where the electricity comes 
from. They want the results of the care. And once

16:38.389 --> 16:46.118
they use that water, really nobody wants to be 
around the area where the water has to be treated.

16:46.378 --> 16:48.180
Either they want to stay away from it. They don't 
want to see it. They want to see it coming out, but

16:49.413 --> 16:52.057
they want to flush it out. They have nothing to do 
with it. So by the time you start thinking of all

16:58.067 --> 17:13.190
those things put together, and then how to 
conserve those natural resources, then it

16:58.067 --> 17:13.190
becomes an area where you need a lot of 
specialists. And to that, we have to rely very

17:13.570 --> 17:17.256
heavily in what technology, at that time, the 
prevailing technology had to offer us. For

17:23.072 --> 17:30.599
example, in the very beginning of the woodlands, 
we thought we were going to do something that

17:23.072 --> 17:30.599
nobody else had done. Purify the water that comes 
out to the degree that you might want to reuse it. We

17:38.347 --> 17:45.994
convinced some of the federal agents up there, and 
they granted some and some grants, gave us some

17:46.312 --> 17:49.475
grants in order to promote that. And we did. The 
first increment of the sewer plant that we did over

17:50.577 --> 18:07.075
here in the Woodlands, we imposed upon ourselves 
the restrictions that the Water Quality Board,

17:50.577 --> 18:07.075
Texas, and EPA at that time sought. And they told us 
it's not necessary. However, we imposed that upon

18:08.857 --> 18:11.400
ourselves. And we have already the increment of 
the infrastructure in. in order to resupply the

18:16.720 --> 18:26.208
lakes with ethanol

18:16.720 --> 18:26.208
from the . And we were the first ones to go ahead and 
install an ozonator. Ozon has a tremendous kill

18:31.613 --> 18:38.979
power as far as bacteria is concerned, but 
dissipates very quickly. But the state law and the

18:40.920 --> 18:46.305
federal law says that when you dump ethanol into a 
creek, the receiving stream has to show a residual

18:46.775 --> 18:57.247
chlorine, which is a disinfectant, for 20 
minutes. That's it. Well, ozone, although it has

18:58.128 --> 19:07.039
10 times the kill power that chlorine has, 
dissipates, however, very quickly. And

19:07.099 --> 19:15.188
therefore, once you start analyzing the sample, 
you're not going to find any residual. So we have to

19:15.208 --> 19:16.630
overcome that. So what we did, we killed with 
ozone, and then we threw in some chlorine in order

19:16.981 --> 19:25.331
for the agency to find the residual down below. To 
meet the requirement. That's correct. Which is,

19:27.734 --> 19:33.461
it was kind of, that's paranoia, you know. And you 
had demonstration plans up in Washington, D.C.

19:33.481 --> 19:40.470
that I went to, without chemicals. It was 
demonstrating to the federal agency down there

19:40.490 --> 19:45.756
how to kill with ozone and pure oxygen. And in fact, 
we drank from them effluent. You know, after it

19:49.576 --> 19:52.480
came out, we drank it. We went up to Tahoe, Tahoe, 
Nevada, yeah. And they had the same, because they

19:56.506 --> 20:03.014
were prohibited in discharging effluent into 
Lake Tahoe. Prohibited. So they had to go over the

20:03.776 --> 20:09.724
mountain 28 miles with a horseman and create lakes 
there. And then ozonate up there and some rainbow

20:10.264 --> 20:14.410
trout this big. And they had the same principle. 
But over here, we have to show residuals. And when

20:20.213 --> 20:33.588
we came in to expand for the second time, EPA, the 
people who gave us the grants originally, said,

20:20.213 --> 20:33.588
now look, if you want our money, if you want our 
money to enlarge your plant, now you have to reduce

20:20.213 --> 20:33.588
your standards. More pollutants. Introducing 
the streams, more pollutants. And that's what we

20:39.454 --> 20:41.376
have. Those are the inconsistencies. In other 
words, what they're telling you, it was a good

20:45.980 --> 20:51.584
thought, a good idea. However, it became very 
expensive in order to do that. Now, if you want our

20:56.629 --> 21:04.536
grants and you reduce your standards, then for the 
same amount of money, we can get twice as much of the

20:56.629 --> 21:04.536
product. That's what they're telling you. So 
instead of having the residual contaminants to be

21:12.203 --> 21:17.909
10 parts per million, 10 parts per million, 10 
parts per million. They say now you can have 20

21:18.269 --> 21:26.037
parts per million, 20 parts per million, 20 parts 
per million contaminants in the effluent coming

21:18.269 --> 21:26.037
out. Because in order to reduce, to take the last 
5%, 5% out, it requires double the amount of money,

21:26.498 --> 21:35.567
or triple maybe. Because now they're getting down 
to the refinements, filtration, and you know. of a

21:41.330 --> 21:45.215
very high tech type of treatment. Tertiary 
treatment, really, that's what I'm talking

21:45.235 --> 21:49.481
about. And they were saying, excuse me for a 
minute, not to conclude it. They say to you that

21:52.205 --> 22:04.022
since the stream does not require, is healthy 
enough not to require this extensive treatment,

21:52.205 --> 22:04.022
therefore reduce the amount of treatment so we can 
do without that high expense. So we have reduced

22:04.743 --> 22:06.686
it. But your basic plan was very, you might say, 
progressive or, way ahead of anybody else's.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.014
There was nothing else, especially in the state, 
definitely. Lake Tahoe had one. Lake Tahoe.

22:20.739 --> 22:28.948
Tahoe, the seat of Tahoe had one, and of course 
there was an experimental thing down in

22:20.739 --> 22:28.948
Washington, D.C., and we were not advanced. Well, 
did this come primarily through your consultants

22:28.968 --> 22:35.156
or through you, this conception?

22:36.037 --> 22:37.999
No, it was a joint type of thinking through a round 
table type of discussions. He was a Mr.

22:42.519 --> 22:57.805
Rice University, the environmental engineering 
department. He was acting as our consultant. A guy

23:02.313 --> 23:03.936
by the name of . He was a PhD in industrial waste. And 
he was the person who originally designed

23:09.339 --> 23:13.243
conceptually. SMB engineers from Houston, who 
are engineers with petrochemical industry,

23:13.884 --> 23:23.156
designed the actual plant, SMB engineers. And it 
was built by LEM, L-E-M, contractors. What was

23:31.405 --> 23:43.199
your main job then, once you began to develop the 
plot and the plan, I guess, primarily contracting

23:31.405 --> 23:43.199
and letting out contracts and supervising the 
construction and so forth? Those are contracts.

23:44.901 --> 23:45.541
Yeah. I just signed them today. This is what 
ensured the contracts for them. I've been reading

23:54.472 --> 23:56.554
about that, yes. This over here, yes. $327 million 
job. And this also is $370 million job. A million

24:06.596 --> 24:08.258
books? Yeah. $370 million. Each one of them. Those 
are for infrastructure facilities that water,

24:10.661 --> 24:15.846
sewer, and drainage pipe on the ground. What I was 
speaking before is the capacity in the plant.

24:21.533 --> 24:22.013
Right. That's interesting. What changes have 
been wrought or created as this first phase of the

24:29.422 --> 24:43.678
Woodlands begins to transition from operation by 
the Woodlands Corporation to operation by the

24:29.422 --> 24:43.678
local citizenry?

24:47.723 --> 24:50.946
How is that going to affect what you do, or will it at 
all? Well, it will not. It will not. Because

24:52.908 --> 24:58.855
what you are referring to, I believe, correct me if 
I'm open the tenure, you're talking about the WCA

24:59.341 --> 25:06.231
taking over. Community association. Yeah, 
community association taking over. The

25:09.416 --> 25:14.544
community association really has nothing to do 
with the development process. The development

25:15.846 --> 25:21.935
process, that is totally in the hands of the 
developer, the Woodland Corporation. The

25:22.876 --> 25:27.964
community association will operate and manage 
all the public facilities other than wet

25:28.113 --> 25:34.985
utilities. They will operate the parks, they will 
operate the lakes, maintain and operate the

25:35.586 --> 25:41.196
lakes. So in other words, the Woodlands 
Corporation will retain

25:41.216 --> 25:52.095
control and operative management of, like, the 
utility districts and... The utility district,

25:52.328 --> 25:58.635
of course, that's more or less like a 
semi-corporation. It's a public entity. The

26:02.780 --> 26:07.345
members of the board are elected by the people that 
they serve. So it is more or less the governmental

26:07.365 --> 26:10.929
entity. That's what it is. WCA will have the 
responsibility of operating and maintaining

26:21.725 --> 26:34.276
public facilities like parks, like pedestrian, 
you know, bike and kite trails, and common areas,

26:21.725 --> 26:34.276
common areas to own. That's the kind of a function 
they have. Also, they have a function in

26:38.400 --> 26:51.411
architectural controls whereby if you want to 
enlarge your house, if you want to alter, you know,

26:38.400 --> 26:51.411
your property, you have to go through that kind of a 
a review, architectural review committee, in

26:51.695 --> 26:58.684
order to be able to alter, make changes. And that's 
the function WCA has. Back in 1992, the Woodlands

27:01.287 --> 27:09.117
would lose the majority vote in that 
organization. That's what you're referring to.

27:11.220 --> 27:13.723
That has nothing to do with the development 
process. The land development process is a part

27:14.364 --> 27:18.950
that's happened from it. This is where we take 
excuse. And where we take the raw land, the raw

27:21.682 --> 27:39.086
land, and we transform it, we develop it to the 
point that will receive a dwelling unit or a store

27:21.682 --> 27:39.086
on the, you know, the above ground type of 
facility. When you do that, incidentally, do you

27:40.007 --> 27:48.499
contract out surveyors and those sub kind of, in 
other words, there's not an in-house facility? of

27:49.238 --> 27:50.859
people to do that. No. Let me give you the process, 
you know, that we follow through. When we break up,

27:56.965 --> 28:07.255
when we project that our needs, and we have a 
five-year projection. The first year is much more

28:07.275 --> 28:11.458
definite than the fifth year. We say that we are 
going to produce next five years 5,000 lots. We'll

28:21.910 --> 28:28.518
have 300 acres of commercial real estate and the 
likes. We have our planners that set up with, of

28:28.598 --> 28:38.090
course, with the marketing people, input of 
whatever they prognosticate. Of course, we have a

28:38.491 --> 28:40.393
market analysis first. That's the first thing. 
What the hell is the market going to be like for the

28:41.875 --> 28:46.060
next five years on a per year basis? Most 
definitely, again, the first year and then next

28:48.740 --> 28:50.783
five years. And we say to ourselves, all right, now 
we're going to develop these thousand acres next

28:50.803 --> 28:57.692
year out of these 5,000 acres. In order to develop 
these 5,000 acres, you cannot look at one year at a

28:57.712 --> 29:09.188
time because some facilities, they take more than 
one year to design, let alone to build. So we have,

29:09.689 --> 29:16.879
in our midst, we have a schedule of things that we 
need to do. For example, how to provide water for

29:18.693 --> 29:21.556
the facilities. If I am to develop 1,000 lots next 
year, or 5,000 lots altogether, I would need the

29:21.616 --> 29:36.553
equivalent of two wells to drill, to drill two 
wells. To drill two wells will cost me half a

29:36.894 --> 29:42.881
million dollars, only for the wells. Now, to bring 
that water into a central plant to disinfect and

29:48.072 --> 29:49.454
put it in storage. Then it would require an 
elevated storage tank of about half a million

29:51.256 --> 29:57.803
dollars. Half a million gallons, half a million 
dollars worth. And then booster pumps in order to

30:00.747 --> 30:07.755
have the water pressure when I deliver it to your 
house, at least with 60 pound pressure. So I have to

30:08.095 --> 30:10.738
push it through the booster pump. So the whole 
thing might cost me about $2 million. And I need two

30:13.321 --> 30:16.425
years to build in order to provide for you two years 
hence. Two years hence. And then, of course, that

30:21.608 --> 30:23.230
followed. If you don't build a storage tank only to 
accommodate 1,000 lots, you've got to build for

30:23.770 --> 30:30.338
5,000. So you have some elements of the 
infrastructure that out there are waiting for the

30:30.378 --> 30:38.347
future development. When you build a sewer plant, 
you don't build for one year synchronously. It

30:42.492 --> 30:44.355
takes you through the permitting process. It 
takes you two or three years. So you can see how

30:46.223 --> 30:49.367
ahead of yourself you have to be. Put a lot up front, 
money and planning and everything else. Yeah. And

30:52.672 --> 30:55.456
that is small amounts. The planning and the 
engineering part ahead of development is a small

30:55.476 --> 31:00.182
amount. Once you start getting into the ground 
with 56-inch diameter pipes and 72-inch pipes,

31:00.302 --> 31:11.117
six feet. taller than you are. You can see 20 feet in 
the ground. You can see how much. Because you're

31:16.812 --> 31:22.697
not going to put a 12-inch pipe in there to 
accommodate only that subdivision. You've got to

31:22.717 --> 31:29.664
think ahead and see what else is going to be coming 
in to this . This more or less will demonstrate

31:31.946 --> 31:34.428
more. Can I pick it up there? Yeah, I think so. so you 
will understand what your evidence is. When we

31:43.596 --> 31:50.723
first started thinking about the woodlands, we 
looked at it, you know, how we're going to service

31:43.596 --> 31:50.723
it. So at that time, the thinking in the 
engineering profession was when you have the

31:51.543 --> 32:08.779
possibility of contaminating something by 
breakdown, you will be better off to happen in

32:09.248 --> 32:10.970
small increments. So it's very unlikely that 
you're going to have a breakdown in more than one

32:11.150 --> 32:17.899
unit. Therefore, if you are going to produce, say, 
30 million gallons per day, ultimately, 30

32:17.919 --> 32:38.884
million gallons per day effluent, if you have it 
all located in one place and you have a breakdown,

32:17.919 --> 32:38.884
30 million gallons a day of untreated sewer will 
come down as a big slug. What are you going to do? You

32:40.336 --> 32:41.057
can't stop it. People are going to keep flushing 
their toilets, whether the plant works or not. So

32:45.964 --> 32:51.432
the thinking back there was to break it down to 
smaller increments. So if we have one break down,

32:51.452 --> 32:57.461
we're going to have 5 million gallons, and 30 
million gallons go astray. And so the thinking at

32:58.523 --> 33:08.297
that time was to have about two or three sewer 
plants on Spring Creek, and then have another two

32:58.523 --> 33:08.297
or three down on Panther Creek, which is this 
destination. And that's how we proceeded at that

33:09.273 --> 33:11.736
time. However, very quickly, it became apparent 
that with all the safeguards that we have, it's

33:11.796 --> 33:27.335
very unlikely that you're going to have a major 
breakdown, even in a large plan. Because in a large

33:27.415 --> 33:32.181
plan, the economy works in your favor. And then 
with a large plan, you can afford to do other things

33:33.877 --> 33:38.541
that you cannot afford to do in small plants. 
Redundant systems. That is correct. That is

33:40.663 --> 33:41.264
correct. Like, for example, auxiliary power. If 
you have a breakdown, say, with commercial power

33:43.886 --> 33:49.231
of the utilities, then you can have an auxiliary 
power. And because of those things, it became very

33:50.352 --> 33:57.098
apparent later on, and that would be engineering 
thinking of the time. And then now we have it down to

33:57.918 --> 34:03.023
sewer plants, to major plants for the woodlands. 
One will be something like 12 million gallons per

34:03.323 --> 34:07.327
day, ultimately. And another one will be about 18 
million gallons per day. Follow me? Yeah. Now,

34:13.113 --> 34:26.027
because of their location, because of their 
location, one would be located or would have

34:13.113 --> 34:26.027
already been designed to be located in this place 
over here, like the 18 million gallon plant. Like

34:26.047 --> 34:32.233
you can see, you see what will have to, will serve 
all this area of the . Therefore, the first piece of

34:33.547 --> 34:38.734
pipe that you put over here will have to be large 
enough to accommodate it. Everything that comes

34:38.794 --> 34:40.135
in and out of there. You follow me? Sure. The other 
way around now, if you were going to develop over

34:42.258 --> 34:55.835
here and the location was over here, then you 
develop over here, now you have to string all these

34:42.258 --> 34:55.835
pipes all the way down there because the first, how 
is it served, has to be connected to the sewer

34:42.258 --> 34:55.835
plant. So you see that the economics, you know, 
dictate that you go from the low land to the upper

34:58.555 --> 35:02.199
land. Oh, because of that. All right. Did, in, say, 
the first phase of development, say, through the

35:06.443 --> 35:16.573
1970s, did basically the planning match the 
reality? Did things develop as you thought they

35:17.033 --> 35:20.457
should, pretty much? Yeah, in a much slower pace. 
Yeah, OK. Our projections at that time Of course,

35:26.669 --> 35:32.716
the economy of this region over here, there was no 
stopping. Whatever you put down on the ground, it

35:32.916 --> 35:38.963
was sold with a profit, whether you knew how to do it 
or not. The market was so healthy. And we were

35:42.046 --> 35:50.536
thinking of finishing up the wilderness in 20 
years, 20, 30 years maximum. We knew, of course,

35:50.756 --> 35:56.322
there would be remnants, strategically located 
parcels of property. that we would not get to as far

35:56.690 --> 36:01.314
as marketing is concerned, but those values that 
were going up. So we thought the development

36:01.334 --> 36:04.517
process would finish in about 20, 30 years. But 
that was one of the assumptions we had made back

36:05.358 --> 36:11.103
then that did not materialize. Other than the 
pace, has there been much change in direction in

36:11.823 --> 36:17.108
the planning and processes? Not very much. Not 
very much at all. Yes, there are some refinements

36:19.730 --> 36:25.515
that we found to be more acceptable in the 
marketplace. Like what? We're market-driven.

36:29.546 --> 36:35.832
Whatever product we create and we manufacture has 
to be sold, has to be accepted in the marketplace.

36:36.093 --> 36:38.655
For example, what? We thought that we would have 
small, narrow, private streets with open ditches

36:38.836 --> 36:50.848
for drainage, for example. The marketplace 
dictates something different. They want you to

36:53.591 --> 36:55.333
have curb and gutter streets, especially in the 
streets that they front on the house, where the

36:55.702 --> 37:04.094
house fronts to. You can go down to Memorial area, 
and you'll find that open ditches are acceptable.

37:11.123 --> 37:13.206
However, we thought the same thing over here. 
However, we do not, this area, the Woodlands is not

37:13.266 --> 37:18.013
Memorial. We don't have the large lots that we, you 
know, down there. I have a lot down there, one and a

37:24.542 --> 37:29.849
quarter acres. Here, when you have a 50, 60, 
70-foot lot, and you have open ditches, then you

37:30.089 --> 37:39.501
have a conglomeration of little culverts, you 
know. And that will be 20 feet. That will be a third

37:42.245 --> 37:46.330
of your lot from it, or something similar to that. 
And then every 60 feet or 50 feet, you have another

37:46.512 --> 37:50.857
one, just like that. And you can see, you know, that 
will not be conducive to a nice environment. So

37:55.603 --> 38:00.008
those are the things that we learned, you know, 
from the marketplaces. Of course, our major

38:00.448 --> 38:04.733
thoroughfares, they're still open beaches. The 
original principle of slowing the water down and

38:04.913 --> 38:14.224
make an amenity out of this water conveyance 
system still persists here in the wilderness

38:04.913 --> 38:14.224
today. However, those are the small things, 
refinement, that I'm speaking of, like curve .

38:20.563 --> 38:24.829
What was the rationale behind the paving bricks at 
the intersection? Oh, that's a visual amenity.

38:27.754 --> 38:29.656
That's all the arrival aesthetics. Strictly 
aesthetic. In order to give you a notion of

38:30.898 --> 38:33.562
arrival. Now, pay attention. You have arrived to a 
different kind of a place. It's nice. When you move

38:42.638 --> 38:49.788
into the 80s now, say, 83, 84, the economy has 
turned down around here. Could you sort of explain

38:51.310 --> 39:03.145
what's happening here in the 1980s and what your 
work is and how it may have differed, say, from

38:51.310 --> 39:03.145
earlier activities? We started playing very, 
very close to the vest. Then our projections, they

39:06.870 --> 39:10.435
were a little bit more conservative. because we 
knew that the market was not here. We were

39:15.470 --> 39:33.315
reacting, and we were able to react to the market 
more so than anybody else because we, at that time,

39:15.470 --> 39:33.315
we decided, Mr. Mitchell decided, management 
decided, to be ready to respond to the market

39:15.470 --> 39:33.315
needs. And therefore, we had our engineering done 
in advance. We had our plans done in advance when

39:36.720 --> 39:40.185
there was a need for a specific type of a product to 
be put out in the marketplace, we're able to react

39:40.655 --> 39:47.905
very quickly. Because the woodland is not a 
subdivision. It's not a 20x subdivision. It's not

39:54.835 --> 39:57.038
a 100x subdivision. It's not a 300x subdivision, 
where the subdiviser will say, now I'm going to

39:57.078 --> 40:07.152
have a product over here, 65 foot large, 120 foot in 
depth, and I'm going to have the product to market

40:07.790 --> 40:10.953
from $120,000 to $150,000. That's not the kind of 
an area we have over here. We have anywhere from low

40:13.876 --> 40:23.845
cost housing and apartments and town houses all 
the way to estates. There might be better than 25

40:24.245 --> 40:28.309
type of categories that we have to produce. Now to 
have inventory, readily made inventory for all

40:28.870 --> 40:36.497
those 25 types of lots, 22 types of lots that you 
have. And to maintain a readily made inventory,

40:37.135 --> 40:43.524
that would be at even, say, $10,000 per lot. You are 
out there $20 million at any one time. Money is

40:47.869 --> 40:49.852
waiting for the marketplace. And that can be very 
strange. At 10% interest per year, you're talking

40:51.674 --> 40:59.004
about $2 million in interest that you're paying on 
inventory that is sitting there. So we are left

40:59.044 --> 41:04.051
with a lot of time to be able to respond to the 
market. And having done And having done the

41:07.477 --> 41:13.705
engineering, within 90 days, I think, we could be 
in production. Yeah. But now you, there was a

41:14.285 --> 41:18.290
distinct turnaround here earlier than most 
places. In fact, you never lost the kind of market

41:18.310 --> 41:24.137
loss that other areas in Houston did in terms of 
housing. No. That's correct. We did not feel the

41:25.319 --> 41:29.504
impact as heavily as they did. Because we were 
able, we had the market over here that had all kinds

41:29.524 --> 41:37.213
of It was across the spectrum. It was very wide. 
While those people, they were reflecting to one

41:40.886 --> 41:44.472
market or the other. And of course, we were selling 
over here a way of life. We were not selling a lot of

41:47.436 --> 41:50.301
house. We were selling a way of life. And I think 
that was more acceptable to the little, weak

41:55.629 --> 42:00.416
market that was there. It was more so attractive to 
the people. Because they used to go someplace else

42:05.358 --> 42:10.184
to buy something. And then before you knew it, even 
that investment would dissipate, would

42:10.685 --> 42:15.911
disappear. While here, at least, they were buying 
a way of life. And that's why the prices and the

42:19.155 --> 42:24.161
values would . It's the downside of the economy. 
And that was not only prevalent here.

42:35.513 --> 42:41.981
master plan community spared quite well compared 
to the rest of the world. The good old days, anybody

42:42.702 --> 42:48.670
who had the money in his pocket, 100 acres of land, 
became a developer. The way a carpenter became a

42:49.250 --> 42:56.099
home builder, you know, because he had a couple of 
dollars and the bank would fund him. When the hard

42:56.319 --> 42:59.884
times came down, either you have it or you don't 
have it. And thank God that we were able to manage

43:01.467 --> 43:15.345
our affairs in such a way to be able to withstand 
the... Now, in 88, 89, you're just getting into a

43:01.467 --> 43:15.345
new surge, apparently, reading in the 
newspapers, at least. You've passed, what, the

43:15.365 --> 43:19.770
billion-dollar sales mark in the woodlands. So 
are you now in a period, as you foresee, of rather

43:19.790 --> 43:25.097
rapid growth and expansion? Again, since we're 
the products of... the ups and downs of the

43:29.547 --> 43:35.035
economy, all of us here, we have witnessed the good 
days and the bad days. We don't get away with the

43:35.696 --> 43:41.824
notion that there is no end to the good times. We 
welcome them. We take advantage of them. We're a

43:45.690 --> 43:49.135
very small outfit over here. We're a service, more 
or less a service company. To the woodlands. That

43:54.602 --> 43:55.343
is correct. We do the engineering, the 
construction, profit centers. When they say that

43:59.281 --> 44:08.529
we want to have 1,000 lots in there, and they tell us 
where, then we'll go ahead and produce it for them

43:59.281 --> 44:08.529
at the time that they want it. And as such, we 
maintain a very small

44:08.549 --> 44:17.498
staff. We are about seven people. So really, 
you're a management group in yourself. Right. And

44:25.525 --> 44:27.887
we have engineers. who really, what we do, we 
manage the engineering firms that we hire from the

44:28.087 --> 44:35.516
outside. And we manage the contractors that we 
feed the jobs through. And we supervise their

44:41.183 --> 44:48.853
work, and we inspect their work, they accept their 
work, and we pay for their work. And we are the eyes

44:48.873 --> 44:55.101
and the ears, you know, of the corporation. 
Absolutely. And over the years, we know what the

44:57.331 --> 45:02.076
profit centers want, the consistency of the 
quality. Our contractors know what the hell we're

45:02.796 --> 45:05.659
going to be looking at. And they don't try to. And we 
have a select group of contractors that they know

45:07.981 --> 45:17.671
that when they come over here to work, what we are 
going to be insisting on, what we're going to be

45:07.981 --> 45:17.671
looking at. And they know that their money, once 
they finish the job, their money is going to be in

45:17.951 --> 45:21.715
the bank. And that's very important to a 
contractor. That's very important to engineers.

45:25.819 --> 45:27.000
To engineers, for example. that they try to 
maintain some kind of clientele that can rely on

45:27.453 --> 45:36.802
for future work. And those people, they know 
exactly what we need. We have three or four

45:40.066 --> 45:45.711
engineering firms that we work with at any one time 
and at all times. And their plans are consistent

45:46.232 --> 45:50.817
with what we want the product to look like. I've 
been dictated to us by the marketplace, by those

45:51.517 --> 45:57.223
people who have to sell the product. But we want the 
street 24 foot wide, 24 foot wide, and that's so

45:57.575 --> 46:03.242
specified. Who's on this management team? What's 
the composition of it? Well, the president, Mr.

46:08.429 --> 46:23.429
Galatas, the residential, the senior vice 
president of residential, the senior vice

46:08.429 --> 46:23.429
president of commercial industry, the senior 
vice president of planning, the senior vice

46:08.429 --> 46:23.429
president of engineering. That's the staff. And 
the marketing team. Are you now pretty well

46:27.190 --> 46:32.357
preoccupied with the expansion of the woodlands 
into the new area? Yes, sir. And with the mall

46:32.717 --> 46:35.922
commercial? Yes, sir. There it is. Now, the 
Woodlands Corporation itself is actually doing

46:41.429 --> 46:47.777
the ski resort in Colorado. Yes, sir. And you're 
doing the extension in Galveston, right?

46:52.083 --> 46:56.689
Pirate's Cove, Sunbird Beach, and Indian Beach 
here. Yeah. And you're in the middle of all of that

46:56.992 --> 47:01.096
as well as the woodland. Yes, sir.
