WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:04.312
Did you even know the word cocaine?

00:07.197 --> 00:07.257
No. Didn't know the word cocaine. Heroin was 
known, and opium. Opium probably more so. But

00:17.814 --> 00:22.262
again, students didn't indulge in those things. 
You just didn't. Alcohol was the drug of choice.

00:27.402 --> 00:39.301
And

00:27.402 --> 00:39.301
I never knew of anybody on heroin or cocaine or even 
marijuana. Again, marijuana being something

00:39.461 --> 00:46.592
that the lower classes dealt in marijuana, people 
that weren't very smart. Let's see. You didn't do

00:48.632 --> 00:52.397
final review your senior year. You didn't do 
commissioning. You didn't get senior boots. I had

00:57.745 --> 01:02.372
senior boots before I was drummed out. I did have 
senior boots for a brief period. Still have them,

01:08.678 --> 01:10.781
as a matter of fact. And you say drummed out. Well, I 
could not review the contract because I had a gap.

01:19.251 --> 01:27.321
And as far as you knew, you and others, they were 
looking for reasons not to have to have too many

01:19.251 --> 01:27.321
second lieutenants. Oh, yeah. Korea's over. We 
don't need them. So they were looking for ways to

01:30.465 --> 01:32.427
get out of it. And truthfully, we were looking ways 
where we were just as happy to be out of it. Senior

01:38.817 --> 01:39.939
ring. Do you remember when you got it? At ring 
dance. When I got it, I got it before ring dance. I

01:47.169 --> 01:53.999
got it between junior and senior year.

01:54.220 --> 02:04.354
An interesting thing, when I was president of the 
Association of Farmer Students, I lost my senior

01:54.220 --> 02:04.354
ring. During that year? During that year, I lost my 
senior ring. And I can't remember the name of the

02:08.568 --> 02:14.054
lady who was ring clerk forever. But we went over 
and went down into the basement where she had the

02:14.074 --> 02:23.986
records. And Buck Wirus went with me and said, 
Miss, this is John. He's president of the

02:30.513 --> 02:32.035
association. He lost his ring. He wants to order 
another one. And she said, I'll check. And she went

02:38.707 --> 02:47.218
off into the tombs and came back with my records and 
on her adding machine added up ours. And then she

02:48.380 --> 02:51.043
said, I guess it will be all right. That wasn't all 
evolution, was it? No, no, no, no, no. What was that

02:56.611 --> 02:57.452
woman? She was ring clerk forever. I can't 
remember her name. But she added, I'm president of

03:01.237 --> 03:04.802
the Association of Farmers. I pay her salary. Was 
there any kind of routine for you and your buddies

03:06.955 --> 03:14.003
when you got your ring that y'all did anything? No, 
I got my ring. See, today, apparently, one of the

03:17.727 --> 03:23.434
things for some people is you put it in a pitcher of 
beer. They drink the whole, all the pitcher. No, we

03:26.998 --> 03:30.462
put it in a four-pitcher. No, we got our ring and we 
put it on right then. What were your feelings about

03:33.685 --> 03:36.068
putting that ring on? This was a symbol that it's 
almost over.

03:42.320 --> 03:47.368
And

03:42.320 --> 03:47.368
the ring was respected. And so this was the symbol 
that it's almost over. And you looked forward to

03:50.593 --> 03:54.259
the ring dance to turn it around. Yes, it was an 
important thing. It was an important part of it,

03:56.826 --> 03:58.929
totally. And when I had mine remade, I had it remade 
as A&M College. But I had to have the new one. It was

04:04.996 --> 04:06.458
by then University. And I had mine made. My 
replacement was made with college on it. Now, did

04:12.386 --> 04:17.352
you put any shoe blacking on your rig? No. Because 
I've understood that that was what some people

04:18.974 --> 04:21.297
did. To keep it looking new? Yeah, yeah. What does 
it mean to wear an egg?

04:32.030 --> 04:36.576
Personal satisfaction, achievement.

04:38.018 --> 04:52.495
It has many times produced recognition in strange 
places, in weird places, in other nations, and it

04:38.018 --> 04:52.495
has produced recognition. Just spur of the 
moment. And of course I have seen it and recognized

04:53.847 --> 05:00.679
people and said something to people when I would 
see the ring. And it's not uncommon even today at my

05:00.699 --> 05:04.346
age. I see it in young people and I see it in people my 
age. And I always say something to them if I spot a

05:11.960 --> 05:15.867
ring somewhere. Did you go to bonfire? No, yes. 
Where was it held? Right in the middle of the drill

05:20.868 --> 05:24.813
field, right in front of the student center. What 
was it composed of? Trees, logs, same thing they do

05:26.915 --> 05:29.438
today. See, once upon a time there was trash, but no 
trash. No trash. No trash in our day. Whose job was

05:34.404 --> 05:38.168
it to put it together? The Corps generally put it 
together, and work assignments were based on your

05:38.188 --> 05:45.617
position in the Corps. So the freshmen were, we 
didn't have cranes. We had a center pole with a rope

05:52.721 --> 05:56.004
on it. And if you get enough freshmen pulling out 
there going that way, you can pull the log up this

05:56.545 --> 06:02.571
way. And so freshmen were beasts of burden. And the 
sophomores weren't a whole lot better. About when

06:10.840 --> 06:15.705
did the effort begin for the bug fight? Wood 
started being cut probably a month before and

06:15.972 --> 06:26.327
trimmed up so that you kept only the trunk of the 
tree. And that started maybe a month earlier

06:27.369 --> 06:32.556
because we did it with axes. We didn't do it with 
chainsaws. Did bonfire seem like a serious area

06:36.021 --> 06:40.528
then? Oh, it was, yeah, it was a joyous event. Yeah. 
Everybody there to have a good time. Yes. Yes. What

06:48.888 --> 06:51.792
about Muster? What about you as a student? Muster 
held, as a student, you went to Muster, which was

06:52.393 --> 07:02.668
normally held in front of the administration 
building. And so you all assembled out there on

07:03.627 --> 07:08.276
that open area toward Highway 6. And it would be the 
entire student body for the muster speech and

07:08.877 --> 07:13.625
address. Daylight address. Daylight. And what 
did that, did that have any... It helped to, it is

07:20.959 --> 07:24.285
the thing I guess that... that triggers you to the 
future when you're gone. That one thing may be the

07:30.129 --> 07:37.824
thing that triggers you into the local club when 
you leave A&M. It's muster that is the habit you

07:39.086 --> 07:47.843
develop that pulls you into the local club. and get 
you to come in. And once you get into the local club,

07:50.511 --> 07:53.354
then you have the camaraderie. When you were an 
undergraduate, you heard the muster roll thing,

07:53.875 --> 08:00.724
right? Did you hear any names that touched you? No, 
nothing to be said. I was wondering if there were

08:07.212 --> 08:15.202
any students that you had known that got killed in 
Korea?

08:15.222 --> 08:15.923
Yes. But it was so common, it was not emotional. 
It's like any war. Oh, Joe got killed. Oh, that's

08:24.236 --> 08:25.457
tough. Damn, he was a good fellow. See, for me, 
Vietnam, to hear the name of the student that had

08:27.640 --> 08:37.450
been in my class was really tough. But I'm talking 
about my age as a student. See, now you're more

08:41.194 --> 08:42.395
mature. You're talking about being a professor. 
now, and that being more mature and more

08:45.907 --> 08:49.793
understanding. But when it's somebody that is 
your age and he went off to war and you expect a

08:49.893 --> 09:00.710
percentage of them to be killed, it's, oh, that's 
too bad. He was a good guy. As you're getting ready

09:02.412 --> 09:13.990
to leave the campus professionally, how did you 
feel about getting a job, whether or not you were

09:02.412 --> 09:13.990
prepared for the real world? I felt adequate and 
felt good because I had been through this series of

09:15.742 --> 09:33.561
things of working for a summer and a semester and 
going to school for a semester and working a summer

09:15.742 --> 09:33.561
and a semester and going to school for a semester. 
So I had passed over that thing of obtaining and

09:34.442 --> 09:42.050
doing and going and so forth. So it was not... 
awesome to me, if you will. I can appreciate how it

09:46.230 --> 09:52.439
can be a frightening thing, somebody coming out. 
But I had passed that because I had been through

09:52.579 --> 09:57.327
that routine. You see, it actually took me

09:57.347 --> 10:11.027
until 55 before I could actually end up with a 
degree in my hand, which was in 52. Did you feel that

10:11.463 --> 10:14.827
A&M prepared you well? Oh yes. I still feel good 
about that. Did A&M help you get a job or did you? No,

10:23.718 --> 10:24.339
no. I had it all lined up. And within two years I went 
into business for myself and had been there ever

10:25.961 --> 10:31.808
since. I knew where I was going. That was all. I knew 
exactly what I was going to do. and how it was going

10:37.028 --> 10:40.672
to get from here to there. Let's see. A side trip. 
Student nicknames, do you remember any that were

10:44.557 --> 10:53.527
funny, goofy?

10:54.047 --> 10:55.649
I haven't stopped thinking about that. Not in 
particular. Because it seems to me in that year

10:57.812 --> 11:01.576
almost everybody had a nickname. I was Bubba. 
There were a thousand Bubbas. Were you Bubba

11:03.878 --> 11:06.141
before you went to A&M? Did you become Bubba later? 
Yeah, I carried Bubba with me. Oh, you carried him

11:09.824 --> 11:12.298
with you. Yeah. And...

11:17.073 --> 11:19.036
I don't think of anything strange. There were all 
of the usual ones, but nothing different, nothing

11:19.096 --> 11:25.044
exciting, nothing strange. Sorry that makes for 
good writing, but it's... Right now, we're

11:28.629 --> 11:30.732
getting ready to the serious part. What did it all 
mean? Are there any things that you had

11:32.655 --> 11:35.899
anticipated? Do you think of any omissions yet? 
Anything we've overlooked, forgotten, left out?

11:45.573 --> 11:46.995
During student days, Pascoe, we're going so far 
back, it's really difficult to recall. Without

11:52.378 --> 11:57.966
your prodding, I would even have more difficulty 
recalling a lot of things that went on. Was

11:58.667 --> 12:00.710
anything Hayden Boatner? Was he the commandant 
all of your years? No. Who took over after him? Jim

12:08.021 --> 12:09.743
something or other. I'm sorry, but the general 
went on to Korea, as a matter of fact. Boatner. Yes.

12:17.649 --> 12:18.229
Prison camp. Yes. And you all knew he would 
straighten it out quickly. I knew they were in lots

12:22.333 --> 12:24.896
of trouble over there. Who was president at A&M 
when you were there? Oh, OK. I bridged Tom

12:31.062 --> 12:34.925
Harrington and David Morgan. Did you have any 
impression of them?

12:40.047 --> 12:50.500
My roommate, the editor of the battalion, and Tom 
Harrington had a running hatred for each other

12:40.047 --> 12:50.500
that, of course, I got involved in. In fact, in 
later years, Tom became a good friend and a man whom

12:50.520 --> 12:59.691
I thought a great deal of. David Morgan was kind of 
like the paint

12:59.711 --> 13:09.042
on the wall. Nothing outstanding about David 
Morgan. And I don't even recall who followed him.

13:15.949 --> 13:22.196
Who was dean of engineering?

13:22.316 --> 13:23.477
The fact that you... He was dean forever. He was 
dean forever.

13:31.325 --> 13:32.106
Gosh. And Gilchrist had already retired. 
Gilchrist was gone. Gilchrist was gone. Oh. Okay,

13:38.317 --> 13:39.739
let's go to the... I'll remember the dean of 
engineering. He was dean of engineering for...

13:41.501 --> 13:52.755
even after I became active in the association's 
work, he was still dean of engineering. What are

13:52.775 --> 14:01.326
the events or circumstances or whatever that make 
up Aggie spirit? People. Learning

14:03.781 --> 14:11.268
how to get along with people, learning how to meet 
and understand. And when you have people with the

14:12.149 --> 14:20.356
common thing, you develop the common bond. And 
it's because you have that commonality and you

14:21.437 --> 14:27.623
want to make it work. And you do make it work. Are 
there any events where these people Oh, yes. Every

14:33.959 --> 14:38.104
city has its own events that are ongoing. I got 
active in the Fort Worth AM Club. But let's go back.

14:42.629 --> 14:47.093
Is this created first on the campus? Well, it's 
created first. You first have a loyalty. I guess

14:52.439 --> 15:00.568
your first loyalty is your roommate, and you 
become

14:52.439 --> 15:00.568
self-protective. And then it's your outfit or 
organization. And I do the quotation marks on

15:07.367 --> 15:27.096
outfit because I am a radical and I told people at 
College Station 30 years ago before I was really

15:07.367 --> 15:27.096
active and I was looked down upon in 1975 because I 
really screamed it from the bully pulpit that I

15:27.515 --> 15:31.062
had. We needed desperately fraternities and 
sororities. Because a fraternity is nothing but

15:38.557 --> 15:41.783
an outfit. And I screamed it loudly and I was 
strongly and loudly put down in those days. I

15:51.700 --> 15:54.784
submit to you that I was right. I wish we had a piece 
of real estate adjacent to the campus where a bunch

15:56.306 --> 16:01.952
of fraternities were. Oh, wouldn't that be 
wonderful? Wouldn't it be wonderful? Because

16:05.777 --> 16:13.806
surely it wouldn't surprise you to find out those 
who live on university or college campuses make

16:05.777 --> 16:13.806
better grades than those who live off. Those who 
live off, who live in an organizational setting.

16:17.550 --> 16:20.653
Do better than those who live in an apartment 
house. Absolutely. There's somebody to turn to to

16:21.193 --> 16:23.696
wake you up, give you help. Absolutely. You 
develop that commonality, that camaraderie,

16:24.797 --> 16:33.265
that spirit, if you will, and that is what turns 
inward. A&M originally got it because of its

16:33.906 --> 16:36.588
isolation. It first developed because it's an 
isolated place. Even when I was there, it was

16:39.791 --> 16:41.633
isolated. You couldn't run down to Houston. You 
couldn't run up to Dallas. You couldn't run over to

16:45.236 --> 16:47.598
San Antonio. Today, transportation being what it 
is, it's nothing to go to those places. But in those

16:51.703 --> 17:01.033
days, you had to plan ahead, and you had to work 
hard, and you had to figure out what you were going

16:51.703 --> 17:01.033
to do before you could go to one of those cities. 
Right now, this causes me to jump back. Neither you

17:03.656 --> 17:09.983
nor anyone else I've interviewed has talked about 
riding on the train to or from College Station. Did

17:10.452 --> 17:13.515
many students ever ride the train? I think that's 
probably the only train service. I rode the train a

17:17.479 --> 17:21.943
couple of times when I would stay to... This was 
after I was senior and was ready to get married. I

17:27.449 --> 17:36.578
rode the train back a couple of times simply 
because I could get the old train out of... It left

17:37.132 --> 17:44.713
Fort Worth here, went to Dallas, and then wandered 
down and picked up milk all the way to Houston. And

17:44.733 --> 17:50.348
you left here about 11 o'clock at night, and you got 
to College Station about 7 o'clock in the morning.

17:50.648 --> 17:54.974
It took that long because it stopped every few 
feet. It had square wheels. I rode that train a few

17:57.778 --> 18:07.152
times, but it was a thing of convenience because I 
had to get down. Serious questions. What did it

18:09.315 --> 18:11.017
mean to you? What has it meant to you in your life 
that you went there? It's meant a great deal to me in

18:12.720 --> 18:16.926
high school because I have put a lot... 
post-graduate in A&M. I've been active in A&M

18:21.319 --> 18:25.125
affairs and still am for that matter. I got into 
local club and from local club into the former

18:27.649 --> 18:44.955
student association council and from the council 
to the executive committee and from the executive

18:27.649 --> 18:44.955
committee to being president and from being, 
after I was When I became past president, Jack

18:45.239 --> 18:57.116
Williams asked me to go on the board at Yellowstone 
and I did. He asked me to serve a number of boards. I

19:00.918 --> 19:06.326
was part of the organization of the press, which I 
have loved every moment of. If I've done anything

19:07.127 --> 19:12.435
good, it was helped to organize the press and to be a 
part of the press. If I've done anything good, that

19:12.755 --> 19:19.065
was

19:12.755 --> 19:19.065
it. Yes, it has meant a lot to me. It has meant that I 
have friends everywhere and friends all over. all

19:27.494 --> 19:51.105
stages of wealth and life and age one of the 
difficult things for me is to identify now with my

19:27.494 --> 19:51.105
own class because you know i i i i don't know if you 
remember remember niley smith he always i'm niley

19:27.494 --> 19:51.105
smith normally well niley was a friend as well as 
people who are still in school are friends And

19:51.676 --> 19:56.861
that's because I have been close to it. And I really 
don't have a strong identification with my class.

20:00.945 --> 20:14.859
But A&M has been a great deal to me because it has 
opened up and let me see a lot of things that

20:00.945 --> 20:14.859
otherwise I would have been lost into my own 
personal daily routine and not be able to see.

20:14.879 --> 20:17.041
Right now, I may be repeating the question. What 
feelings do you have in your heart for A&M now?

20:24.363 --> 20:39.660
I am

20:24.363 --> 20:39.660
planning now to

20:24.363 --> 20:39.660
try to do some work with a group that Barry Thompson 
organized.

20:42.382 --> 20:52.193
A side issue to the old Target 2000 group, and I was 
vice chairman of that group, a side issue to that

20:42.382 --> 20:52.193
that that got buried, I think, out of fear and 
concern and lack of desire was we did not look far

20:52.966 --> 21:05.222
enough. Target 2000 group took A&M and A&M is 
exactly what Target 2000 designed

21:18.278 --> 21:28.648
There was a group of us, an undercurrent, that 
said, somewhere out there beyond, universities

21:18.278 --> 21:28.648
are going to have to change. Universities. And we 
need to plan that now. And so a lot was done, but not

21:34.934 --> 21:38.918
enough. And I think that what has happened to the 
system recently as increasingly new Texas A&M

21:47.692 --> 22:03.529
universities are growing is where 2000 was headed 
but couldn't bring itself to go there.

22:03.729 --> 22:13.800
It is not practical to take A&M much farther than it 
is now in population. And yet the A&M experience,

22:15.670 --> 22:26.580
the spirit, the ideas, the basic thoughts and so 
forth need to be made open to an ever increasing

22:15.670 --> 22:26.580
population. It is important that that experience 
be available to ever more and more and more people.

22:33.427 --> 22:38.572
It's in the interest of the future students. It's 
in the interest of Texas that we take this idea and

22:39.212 --> 22:45.238
we expand on it. And somehow, Texas A&M University 
at Canyon has to become Texas A&M University. And

22:54.990 --> 22:59.498
Texas A&M University Kingsville has to become 
Texas A&M University. And Texas A&M University

23:00.379 --> 23:04.426
Carpets has to become Texas A&M University. And 
there has to be absolutely no difference between

23:04.947 --> 23:11.378
them. and a course in the history of the war between 
the states, the unpleasantness, which I think is

23:13.248 --> 23:38.125
your field, the unpleasantness of the 1860s, the 
same course that is taught at College Station has

23:13.248 --> 23:38.125
to be taught everywhere and at the same time. so 
that the benefit can be taken through video

23:38.341 --> 23:55.460
conferencing of the knowledge of 
Haskell-Monroe, and it can be delivered to each of

23:38.341 --> 23:55.460
these other campuses at the same hour, on the same 
day, out of the same book, and so forth. Otherwise,

23:55.480 --> 24:03.589
we cannot deliver the education that we need to to 
the people of Texas, and we have to do that. And so

24:03.940 --> 24:11.339
now it's time to plan again and let's look out there 
for 18, for 2050. And let's be prepared and let's be

24:11.480 --> 24:20.363
there before we're in trouble for not going.
