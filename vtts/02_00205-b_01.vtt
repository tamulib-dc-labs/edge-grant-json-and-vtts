00:02.242 --> 00:06.594
The first year, do you remember how many courses you taught and what they were?

00:06.614 --> 00:09.402
I don't remember exactly.

00:11.628 --> 00:13.433
Did you get to select the courses?

00:13.700 --> 00:14.201
No.

00:14.701 --> 00:17.025
No, I didn't ever select the courses.

00:17.065 --> 00:17.906
Not then.

00:17.966 --> 00:21.832
You just taught what the department had told you to teach.

00:22.693 --> 00:36.973
And there was a sort of proprietary interest in certain courses, so that if a professor had staked out that area as his area, then you never rotated.

00:36.953 --> 00:53.258
So that for the first years I was here, I never taught American diplomatic history because the man who taught it, Claude Hall, for whom I have the greatest respect.

00:53.238 --> 00:55.381
And I never wanted to confront him.

00:55.621 --> 00:57.023
I knew that he did it well.

00:57.805 --> 01:00.649
And I did want to teach it.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.191
There was no question about that.

01:02.632 --> 01:08.740
But I never felt like it was worth confrontation, because I liked Claude so much.

01:08.821 --> 01:12.165
And I knew he enjoyed teaching that course.

01:12.866 --> 01:15.330
And I knew also that he did it well.

01:15.310 --> 01:31.463
So it was just one of those things that where rather than make a scene over it, I just decided that these other courses I could teach and I enjoyed teaching them and they needed to be taught and they were areas where

01:31.443 --> 01:35.250
there were other people who were not qualified.

01:35.570 --> 01:39.817
And I was qualified to teach East Asian history, actually.

01:39.878 --> 01:44.365
My professor was Paul Clyde at Duke, and that was his major area.

01:44.966 --> 01:47.310
And I'd done a lot of work in it.

01:47.771 --> 01:56.927
So I was perfectly happy to teach Russian history, which I expanded from one course

01:56.907 --> 02:08.679
to three courses so that we had a year course in Russian history, two semesters, and then another semester in Soviet history.

02:09.100 --> 02:13.264
Were you the first to teach Russian history here?

02:13.684 --> 02:14.425
I think so.

02:15.326 --> 02:16.127
I think so.

02:16.607 --> 02:21.092
If someone else taught Russian history, they weren't teaching it when I came.

02:21.815 --> 02:27.482
Now, I know that Claude had taught the Far East before I came.

02:28.202 --> 02:32.568
But when I came, then I began teaching the Far East.

02:32.748 --> 02:37.353
And I expanded that course from the Far East into two semesters.

02:37.734 --> 02:45.362
And then I expanded it to take in Asian civilizations, because I said that I felt very strongly about two things.

02:45.623 --> 02:50.168
One was that we only taught Western civilization.

02:50.148 --> 03:03.746
And I thought that was just so parochial at this time in history that our students had no exposure to Eastern civilizations and to other civilizations besides Western.

03:04.186 --> 03:07.190
And so that's the first thing that I worked to do here.

03:07.571 --> 03:13.759
And the second thing was to transform the East Asia into Asian civilizations

03:13.739 --> 03:21.271
Because I think now about broadening an international university, we still have a long way to go on that, Haskell.

03:21.752 --> 03:25.698
But I think that those were important steps that needed to be taken.

03:25.878 --> 03:28.402
And frankly, it wasn't the first.

03:28.523 --> 03:30.786
I did the same thing at Cal State Fullerton.

03:31.187 --> 03:38.278
I had to help them see the importance of expanding from Western civilization to world civilization.

03:38.258 --> 03:43.845
and also from just teaching the Far East to Asian civilizations.

03:46.388 --> 03:52.475
So I was happy to do that, and I enjoyed my students.

03:53.236 --> 04:05.110
And it was exciting because it was like you were opening up a whole new world to them that they had never been exposed to before.

04:05.090 --> 04:08.337
And we did well in those courses at that time.

04:09.179 --> 04:24.212
And I always worked in the department to try to expand our program to the Middle East, to Africa, so that we really were teaching in the international field.

04:24.783 --> 04:28.146
And it was slow going.

04:28.546 --> 04:35.833
It was really slow going, because there was such, and I mean, basically, I'm an American diplomatic historian.

04:36.293 --> 04:54.790
But in American diplomatic history, you have to have fields in all of these other areas, which is one reason why it was possible for me to teach in these other fields, because you have to have that kind of an international background, and more so, of course, nowadays.

04:54.770 --> 05:10.730
But in any case, sometimes there was sort of an opposition to any expansion, even into Europe, by the Americanists.

05:11.331 --> 05:12.993
So it was not easy.

05:14.094 --> 05:16.397
And we had to work hard at it.

05:16.517 --> 05:22.144
We had to be patient.

05:23.221 --> 05:25.890
We certainly did, I think, make progress.

05:26.130 --> 05:31.307
I think now this department is the best history department in the state of Texas.

05:31.793 --> 05:44.410
And I think if you look at the research record, if you look at the research record alone, it has come so far since the days when I first got here.

05:45.972 --> 05:49.497
It's just amazing what we have been able to do.

05:50.658 --> 05:55.865
So, now, you're speaking about the friendliness of the students.

05:56.586 --> 05:58.729
I always have loved the students here.

05:59.637 --> 06:06.484
They may be very narrow at times because they come from provincial backgrounds, a lot of them.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.175
But they...

06:11.669 --> 06:13.131
They're ready to learn.

06:13.171 --> 06:19.419
And it's exciting to see the process of discovery.

06:19.599 --> 06:22.323
And I teach so that I get to know the students.

06:22.463 --> 06:28.110
I've always made it a practice to learn the students' names.

06:28.171 --> 06:31.635
That's the first thing I do on the first day of class.

06:31.615 --> 06:33.120
I get to know all their names.

06:33.180 --> 06:42.992
I ask them to write down little notes about who they are and what they want to be when they grow up and all that kind of stuff, what they're really interested in.

06:43.985 --> 06:57.237
And that way, and then I memorize those names and I attach them to the little pieces of paper that I get and I go in and students still are always just amazed because I know their names.

06:57.257 --> 07:00.099
But I have learned how important that is.

07:00.139 --> 07:09.628
I mean, a student will work so much harder for a professor when that professor knows who he or she is.

07:10.248 --> 07:12.270
And it's always been that way.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.434
So I've made that effort.

07:14.454 --> 07:20.585
But the other thing I've always liked is I never got upset when the students walked across the campus and say, howdy.

07:21.366 --> 07:23.470
I always thought that was great.

07:23.490 --> 07:27.937
And I always tried to respond, although it was different.

07:27.957 --> 07:29.760
It certainly wasn't hello.

07:29.781 --> 07:32.385
It was always howdy.

07:32.365 --> 07:42.620
And I think that's one of the things that has contributed to a sense of being a part of a big family.

07:43.781 --> 07:48.468
You mentioned a while ago the plop of the tobacco chillers.

07:48.548 --> 07:52.814
Do you remember any other learning experiences for you as a new faculty member?

07:52.974 --> 07:53.255
Yes.

07:53.876 --> 07:54.216
Chicken.

08:00.385 --> 08:01.967
When you...

08:02.825 --> 08:09.633
you would, now I can't remember what was the way they approved of it or disapproved of it.

08:10.374 --> 08:13.098
Disapproved of it, anyway.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.740
You might hear that from the back of the room.

08:14.820 --> 08:21.909
Yes, or another thing was if they approved, they'd go whoop.

08:21.929 --> 08:29.558
So if you said something that they really liked, you'd hear whoop, whoop, whoop, et cetera.

08:29.639 --> 08:37.128
I'll tell you one of the times that really made me aware of this so-called Aggie spirit.

08:40.572 --> 08:47.480
I think it was around, it must have been around 1978 or so.

08:49.843 --> 08:54.128
I had been invited to go to Maxwell Air Force Base.

08:56.335 --> 09:01.261
for a week-long seminar in world affairs.

09:02.082 --> 09:11.112
Now, at Maxwell Air Force Base, they have a program for officers who are going to be promoted ultimately to general.

09:11.372 --> 09:13.635
You know, colonels, light colonels, et cetera.

09:14.416 --> 09:20.082
And they had the six-week program that they had to go through at Maxwell Air Force Base.

09:20.062 --> 09:33.736
And then at the end of the six weeks, they had this sort of graduation week when they would invite experts in world affairs to come and lead these seminars for a week and various issues in world affairs.

09:34.779 --> 09:37.345
And so...

09:37.325 --> 09:41.552
I was invited to go and lead one of these seminars.

09:42.213 --> 09:46.200
And so I was just delighted to have that opportunity.

09:46.881 --> 09:56.698
And I'd gotten used to teaching the military because when I first came here, some of my classes were all cadets and never women.

09:57.740 --> 09:58.962
Well, never women.

09:59.279 --> 10:07.895
Initially, and then even after we began to admit women, rarely did I get women because the courses that I taught were supposed to be male courses.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.922
I mean, for some reason.

10:12.423 --> 10:14.467
So I didn't get many women.

10:14.948 --> 10:20.157
But anyway, and in this World Affairs seminar, I was the only woman seminar leader.

10:21.385 --> 10:23.528
But in any case, they sent for me.

10:23.548 --> 10:27.053
I had to go to Ellington Air Force Base.

10:27.855 --> 10:31.720
And they sent a T-39 to pick me up.

10:32.442 --> 10:37.008
And the president of Texas Tech was also invited to go.

10:37.449 --> 10:42.537
And so he and I were the only ones on this T-39, which was lots of fun for both of us.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.339
Anyway, we flew in there.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.085
And I got off the plane.

10:48.065 --> 10:53.485
And here were these three colonels standing there.

10:54.950 --> 10:57.413
and they were Aggie colonels.

10:58.154 --> 11:06.526
The Aggie colonels found out that an Aggie professor was going to be there, and they had come to greet me.

11:06.546 --> 11:15.959
Well, I will tell you that all the time that I was there, those Aggie colonels just treated me like I was royalty.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.763
It was just...

11:18.743 --> 11:21.150
It was a heartwarming experience.

11:21.471 --> 11:32.263
They were so pleased to have a professor from their school and it was just, it was, I don't think I could have said anything that they would have disagreed with.

11:34.133 --> 11:42.582
But anyway, it was just one of those wonderful moments when I suddenly realized that it didn't matter whether you were male or female.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.587
You were an Aggie, and they were going to support you.

11:47.207 --> 11:58.220
And it was just, as I say, a very warm and comforting experience, especially since I was the only woman there.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.462
As you recall,

12:01.319 --> 12:17.125
What was your first impression of A&M student capability when you gave tests those first years here compared to what you had, the level of ability you had known at Whittier and at Fullerton?

12:18.587 --> 12:19.228
Not as good.

12:19.689 --> 12:20.450
Not as good?

12:20.470 --> 12:21.091
Not as good.

12:21.191 --> 12:21.812
Not as good here?

12:22.253 --> 12:23.395
Not as good here, no.

12:24.056 --> 12:24.937
Okay, all right.

12:24.958 --> 12:25.018
No.

12:25.038 --> 12:26.500
When did that begin to change?

12:33.128 --> 12:39.283
I think it took about six or eight years before that began to change.

12:40.085 --> 12:44.495
Because I'm assuming that you didn't change your standards.

12:44.856 --> 12:50.209
No, I didn't, but I found that

12:52.265 --> 12:57.773
It was hard to have them do all the reading that they required to do.

12:59.396 --> 13:02.120
And, but I think that's still the case.

13:02.260 --> 13:06.146
But I think that maybe TV may be to blame for that now.

13:07.167 --> 13:20.567
As you look back on those first few, two or three years for you as a newcomer here, what did the institution do right for this, to get this newcomer here?

13:21.408 --> 13:29.636
And instead of asking what did the institution do wrong, what else could it have done, should it have done for a new faculty member?

13:39.265 --> 13:40.586
I don't know how to.

13:45.531 --> 13:48.934
I just remember how lonely it was.

13:49.471 --> 13:56.178
and how I didn't have anybody to talk to about my research to say nothing of anything else.

13:56.719 --> 13:58.982
But I missed that a lot.

13:59.622 --> 14:02.526
But of course, I hadn't had a lot of it elsewhere either.

14:03.286 --> 14:12.897
So it was just a continuation of something that I found that whatever

14:21.112 --> 14:29.980
whatever sharing of research interests was outside of the university.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.825
I didn't think there was a lot of emphasis on research.

14:36.266 --> 14:39.208
I thought the emphasis was primarily on teaching.

14:40.149 --> 14:49.718
And it was a, and I was very quiet about the way that I taught because I knew that I was teaching very differently

14:50.930 --> 14:51.963
And...

14:53.680 --> 14:58.985
And I would even ask students like, what do you think are the most important questions that ought to be asked on an exam?

14:59.365 --> 15:12.717
Well, that was, I don't think Professor Nance liked that at all, because he thought that the students were telling me what questions I needed to ask on the exam, which was not the point at all.

15:12.757 --> 15:23.687
The point was, I wanted to see whether or not they appreciated what were the most important aspects of the material that we were discussing together.

15:23.667 --> 15:26.493
I always used the discussion approach.

15:27.355 --> 15:34.451
Now, did he ever give you any feedback on those tests you turned in, the textbook proposals or anything?

15:34.852 --> 15:35.454
Did he ever?

15:36.837 --> 15:40.545
I think I told you about the one time that his son,

15:42.145 --> 15:44.647
Joe Nance was in my class.

15:45.568 --> 15:50.633
And I always, I had the students do a lot of outside reading.

15:51.474 --> 15:57.480
And I always had essay questions on the reading.

15:58.481 --> 16:03.166
Not just on the lectures, but on the outside reading.

16:03.186 --> 16:04.387
So Joe came into class.

16:04.427 --> 16:06.168
And Joe was a bright enough kid.

16:07.250 --> 16:10.853
And he failed the first exam.

16:12.554 --> 16:18.003
And first of all, I was terrified that he had to be in my class.

16:18.063 --> 16:24.974
I wished there was some way I could get him out, because I knew that I did a lot of things that Professor Nance probably wouldn't approve of.

16:25.935 --> 16:30.523
And so I thought when he failed the first exam.

16:30.603 --> 16:36.452
And he failed the first exam because he obviously had not done the outside reading.

16:36.432 --> 16:43.202
And so I'm just waiting for the ax to fall.

16:43.783 --> 16:45.185
I'm walking down the hall.

16:45.506 --> 16:50.273
Professor Nance stops me and he says, Mrs. Unterberger.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.656
He always called me Mrs. Unterberger.

16:52.696 --> 17:00.428
Everyone else in the whole department was always doctor, but I was always Mrs. Until one day I went in and I told him.

17:00.929 --> 17:01.950
I said,

17:02.302 --> 17:05.186
You know, you didn't hire me because I'm married.

17:05.586 --> 17:07.729
You hired me because I had a PhD.

17:08.190 --> 17:12.235
You call everybody else in this department doctor except me.

17:12.255 --> 17:16.901
Would you kindly remember that I am as qualified in this department?

17:16.981 --> 17:18.043
They're all married, too.

17:19.344 --> 17:22.549
And so... What was his reaction?

17:22.969 --> 17:24.411
He called me doctor after that.

17:25.927 --> 17:32.236
But I was sort of getting up to here with this sense of being discriminated against.

17:32.837 --> 17:34.499
For whatever reason, it didn't matter.

17:34.519 --> 17:36.742
It seemed to me that he ought to recognize that.

17:37.864 --> 17:40.788
And then the students would do the same thing then.

17:41.188 --> 17:44.272
Everybody else would be doctor and I would be missus.

17:44.693 --> 17:49.740
So I used to go into class and I didn't give a hoot about whether I had the title or not.

17:49.900 --> 17:50.441
I knew.

17:50.501 --> 17:55.528
But I'd go into class and on the board I would write.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.111
Dr. Betty Unterberger.

17:58.131 --> 18:04.218
So they would get the point that women were doctors and professors as well as men.

18:04.979 --> 18:06.701
And that was the one thing I did too.

18:07.722 --> 18:13.029
But anyway, so Milton stopped me in the hall and I thought, uh-oh.

18:13.649 --> 18:20.858
And he said, Mrs. Unterberger, I just want to thank you for failing Joe in the exam.

18:21.682 --> 18:34.058
believe it, he said he did not do the work and he needed to learn that you can't get by without doing the reading and you taught him that lesson.

18:34.078 --> 18:44.972
Well I will tell you my opinion of Professor Nance went way up and Joe always did the reading after that so he learned his lesson.

18:45.340 --> 18:57.257
But that was one of the happier experiences in the whole process of teaching here.

18:57.677 --> 19:14.841
What if departments had a policy of selecting a comparative senior person to be a friend for every new faculty member?

19:15.091 --> 19:24.164
If I'm a newcomer that here is a faculty member who's a veteran here, who would be my friend, my introducer, my advisor?

19:24.805 --> 19:29.832
Well, you know, that's one of the things that the Women's Faculty Network does now for women.

19:29.852 --> 19:32.956
That is, I have, I'm a mentor, a faculty.

19:33.316 --> 19:39.445
I'm just, and I, and so they assign me a new woman.

19:39.425 --> 19:43.649
who just has someone that they can talk to about.

19:43.890 --> 19:44.770
In the department?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.432
No, no, not necessarily.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.134
No, it can be in the department.

19:48.394 --> 19:50.616
But in this case, we don't have any new women.

19:50.977 --> 19:54.540
And so I was assigned to someone in modern languages.

19:55.661 --> 19:58.765
So, yes, I think that's wonderful.

19:59.085 --> 19:59.545
I do.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.407
I think that's a great help.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.309
I would think that would be valuable anyway.

20:03.489 --> 20:04.150
Yes, yes.

20:04.687 --> 20:09.153
I would think so, and also not just for women, but for everyone.

20:09.374 --> 20:16.945
Everyone in a new institution needs to have someone who's going to just tell them the way things are and help them with any problems.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.888
I'm having trouble with my parking space.

20:18.928 --> 20:20.069
Yes.

20:21.191 --> 20:22.633
I can't get something to work.

20:23.094 --> 20:25.617
What do you do with this piece of red tape?

20:25.637 --> 20:26.298
That sort of thing.

20:28.341 --> 20:29.423
Let's see.

20:30.164 --> 20:31.987
Oh, I have to tell you another Aggie.

20:32.287 --> 20:34.390
This is a great Aggie story.

20:35.011 --> 20:38.936
I had a couple of students when I first came here.

20:40.277 --> 20:47.947
One was in, he was the second command in the band, and he took my course in the Far East.

20:48.828 --> 20:52.552
And he had a lot of the attitudes that a lot of the Corps people had then.

20:52.592 --> 21:02.284
They were not very, they were, they didn't hold views

21:04.137 --> 21:10.424
about minorities or Asians, who are also minorities.

21:11.184 --> 21:16.169
And so I'll never forget, he came into class, and it was a class in East Asia.

21:16.970 --> 21:21.335
And I asked him, I always ask him, what are you taking this course for?

21:21.635 --> 21:24.398
I mean, why would you want to take a course in East Asia?

21:25.199 --> 21:28.322
And I remember, I want to know something about the people I'm going to kill.

21:32.369 --> 21:47.638
And this is another illustration of how you can't ever judge the capacity of people to learn or to change or to gain understanding.

21:47.979 --> 21:51.846
I had learned that early on with Mr. Hughes.

21:51.826 --> 21:58.677
And so I don't, I just accept initially.

21:58.697 --> 22:11.398
And I let them, through the material and the teaching, learning experience with their own discovery, decide whether or not they want to change their views or not.

22:12.019 --> 22:16.686
Well, it happened with this young man.

22:18.134 --> 22:22.100
he became fascinated with the coursework.

22:22.821 --> 22:23.742
And he changed.

22:23.822 --> 22:26.967
And he'd come and he'd ask me for additional readings.

22:27.067 --> 22:28.770
And I'd give him additional readings.

22:29.351 --> 22:32.596
And then he'd come and he'd talk to me about the additional readings.

22:33.377 --> 22:44.714
And it was a wonderful experience of seeing a student just go through a process of discovery that you never would have thought possible.

22:44.754 --> 22:47.618
This was early on in my career.

22:47.598 --> 22:50.704
Now, was this by chance still during Vietnam days?

22:51.606 --> 22:52.969
Yes, yes, yes.

22:53.630 --> 23:02.067
And he thought that he was going to go to Vietnam, as a lot of the military personnel did at that time.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.750
Well, anyway.

23:03.730 --> 23:06.475
But it was through him.

23:06.515 --> 23:15.030
And then another member of the band, whom I had in class, and who also was someone who just didn't know anything about the rest of the world.

23:15.091 --> 23:17.836
Their whole world was wrapped up in East Texas.

23:18.236 --> 23:20.280
But anyway, these two guys, they went out.

23:21.081 --> 23:25.249
They did serve in the war.

23:25.229 --> 23:35.188
And then afterwards, they had both become so interested in international things, which they had learned in my class.

23:35.969 --> 23:38.854
So they went, they traveled all over the world.

23:39.616 --> 23:43.423
And in every place they went, they'd live and work and so on, et cetera.

23:43.572 --> 23:47.175
Well, they both ended up, as it turned out, and they wrote to me.

23:47.716 --> 23:53.541
I have letters that you wouldn't believe, Haskell, from students from all over the world.

23:53.962 --> 23:57.465
And they've written, they told me what it's like and what they've learned.

23:58.045 --> 24:04.631
And not just from Vietnam, but also even from the Gulf War.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.373
I have another story to tell you about that.

24:06.733 --> 24:11.858
But anyway, so some years, oh, I guess it was in,

24:11.838 --> 24:23.634
These two men were in Switzerland, and they both had excellent jobs.

24:23.674 --> 24:25.476
They were doing very, very well.

24:26.658 --> 24:34.588
And it was at that point in Europe that they began thinking American football was a good thing.

24:34.720 --> 24:38.964
These guys were gung-ho Aggie football fans.

24:40.085 --> 24:45.750
And so when they found out, they were in Bern, Switzerland.

24:46.931 --> 24:52.416
And since I had been writing to them, they had written to me.

24:52.476 --> 24:55.979
They had told me wonderful stories about their adventures everywhere.

24:56.019 --> 25:04.086
And so they decided that they were going to help to organize a Bern, Switzerland,

25:05.315 --> 25:06.577
And how are they going to do it?

25:06.737 --> 25:09.180
They're going to do it with help from the Aggies.

25:10.182 --> 25:15.910
So they wrote to me and they said, I was on the athletic council at the time.

25:15.930 --> 25:24.102
They wrote to me and they said, how can we get some Aggie, maybe an Aggie football player to come over and coach us?

25:25.023 --> 25:27.306
Or how can we get this started?

25:27.546 --> 25:30.130
And so I said, well, I would look into it.

25:30.230 --> 25:32.233
So I talked to them.

25:32.213 --> 25:40.795
I talked to Slocum, and he made some suggestions about persons whom he thought would be willing to go.

25:40.855 --> 25:48.535
And so we had an Aggie football player that went over to coach the Burn Grizzlies.

25:49.072 --> 26:04.520
Then, these two Aggies taught the burned grizzlies the Aggie fight songs, all the Aggie cheers and in German.

26:05.081 --> 26:05.983
I could just say.

26:09.473 --> 26:11.415
in German.

26:11.435 --> 26:16.461
Anyway, so then we had an Aggie football player that went over regularly.

26:16.862 --> 26:20.927
I helped them to get some of the used football equipment over here.

26:21.347 --> 26:22.969
But anyhow, we worked out this deal.

26:22.989 --> 26:30.638
So season after season, they would get help from Slocum and the

26:30.888 --> 26:33.431
the Aggies and the coaches and so on.

26:34.072 --> 26:36.755
And so then they were getting pretty good.

26:37.316 --> 26:44.284
And these guys were helping to coach and teaching them and giving them that good old Aggie spirit.

26:45.165 --> 26:51.292
And the Byrne Grizzlies won the European Championship.

26:53.194 --> 26:58.060
And so they sent me a big

26:59.002 --> 27:08.117
a document, a certificate, and I was made honorary coach of the Byrne Grizzlies.

27:09.363 --> 27:11.265
But it was a story that I just loved.

27:11.285 --> 27:18.711
There was all kinds of news about it in the Bern Grizzly, in the Bern papers and here and so on.

27:18.751 --> 27:20.893
But it was just such fun.

27:21.394 --> 27:24.296
And I thought, here are those Aggies.

27:24.457 --> 27:27.840
Of course, they arranged Aggie muster and everything in Switzerland.

27:28.260 --> 27:39.370
But it was just another illustration of that Aggie spirit and the way it got transferred to the Bern Grizzlies so that all the Bern Grizzlies knew about Texas A&M.

27:39.350 --> 27:54.248
When you got here there were, women had been officially admitted but there weren't many women enrolled yet because they couldn't live in the dorms and they had to be a dependent of an employee or a student and so forth.

27:54.268 --> 28:02.218
As the coeds began to grow in number, how did things change in your classes?

28:02.975 --> 28:04.217
How did the atmosphere?

28:04.237 --> 28:06.060
I had so few women.

28:06.821 --> 28:10.326
And when they came into class, they didn't open their mouths.

28:11.248 --> 28:16.636
So one of the big challenges that I faced was how to get the women involved.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.080
Share with how did you do that?

28:19.100 --> 28:19.380
Yes.

28:19.581 --> 28:24.949
And so I made it a point to get to know the women especially.

28:24.929 --> 28:28.858
And they would tell me that they were afraid to speak up.

28:29.439 --> 28:32.005
And besides which, women aren't supposed to be smart.

28:32.607 --> 28:36.616
They're not supposed to be smart, and they're not supposed to compete with the men.

28:36.676 --> 28:41.908
And they came from backgrounds where that was the appropriate mode of behavior.

28:41.888 --> 28:54.215
And so if they'd come and talk to me about what they want to do, it was always not, for instance, well, I love medicine, but I'm going to be a nurse.

28:54.996 --> 28:55.999
Why not a doctor?

28:56.239 --> 28:59.847
Oh, no, no way that they could think of being a doctor, et cetera.

29:00.097 --> 29:06.728
I'm a medical mentor now for the same reason that I started to work with the women on campus.

29:07.649 --> 29:21.632
And so I began, so I would talk to them about the possibilities that were available to them and that they shouldn't shortchange themselves, that, you know, I have this view that

29:23.772 --> 29:31.481
We are all given great gifts and talents and abilities, and those are gifts from the divine.

29:32.682 --> 29:41.111
And our gift in return is to realize those potentials.

29:41.272 --> 29:47.839
That's the way we show our gratitude, is to use what we have been given.

29:47.819 --> 30:02.841
And so I would talk, never in a religious way, but just in a way that would help them to realize that one of our responsibilities in life is to give back what has been given to us.

30:02.821 --> 30:05.105
and not to shortchange themselves.

30:05.706 --> 30:09.573
And so I would talk to them about that, and then in class to help them.

30:10.335 --> 30:22.357
I would say things like, I'm going to raise a question about this or that, and I hope that you'll respond, because I think if you respond the first time, you will get over that fear.

30:22.497 --> 30:25.082
I've always discovered that the first time

30:25.062 --> 30:33.495
that you speak in a situation that seems to be forbidding, that you break the ice and it's a lot easier the second time.

30:33.615 --> 30:35.298
So I would do that.

30:35.518 --> 30:36.340
I would work on that.

30:36.780 --> 30:41.047
And if there were men in the class that had that problem, I would do the same thing for them.

30:41.067 --> 30:52.605
It wasn't just for women, but it was more often for women because culturally and socially they had been raised to be quiet, to sit back.

30:52.585 --> 30:56.531
to look for something less competitive, etc.

30:56.871 --> 30:58.053
So I worked on that.

30:58.273 --> 31:09.850
But I think that for a lot of the women, as for me, and this was true, I only had one woman professor in all of my education.

31:10.511 --> 31:13.435
But it so happened that she was first-rate.

31:13.856 --> 31:20.145
She was at Syracuse University and she taught citizenship.

31:20.125 --> 31:26.335
She taught political science, and I'll never forget what it meant to me to go into a class.

31:26.555 --> 31:28.458
She was a dynamic teacher.

31:28.959 --> 31:34.988
In fact, they've just named a seminar, a wing of the building after it's Syracuse.

31:35.389 --> 31:45.525
In fact, when they built on this big, beautiful addition to the Maxwell School, they invited me back to dedicate it, and I had to give a lecture at that time.
