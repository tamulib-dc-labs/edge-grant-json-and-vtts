WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.096
You tried to do. First, when you got to the office, 
was there each morning? Like Doctor Williams used

00:09.952 --> 00:12.218
to have his they had his paperwork for him to sign 
first. What did? I think basically that was it, was

00:17.940 --> 00:20.203
get the paperwork. But generally I was not a good 
dictator, so I hand wrote most of my papers and

00:20.824 --> 00:27.635
things of this sort. I introduced the policy of 
reply by note. In other words, somebody would send

00:34.304 --> 00:45.465
me a letter, and I'd insist that they just have one 
point into that note, yes, no, and I'd put a xerox

00:34.304 --> 00:45.465
it, and it goes. Well, that took care of a lot of the 
responsibility in the mail. During those years,

00:49.091 --> 00:52.598
who were your key office staff members? Mary Ruth 
Patronella had to be listed as one. Describe her

00:56.425 --> 00:58.168
work.

01:01.388 --> 01:10.980
She probably knows more about the College of 
Agriculture today and then than anyone else. And

01:12.122 --> 01:17.729
Elizabeth

01:12.122 --> 01:17.729
Williamson was a person. These are two staff 
people that I've worked with.

01:25.258 --> 01:29.083
Curtis Lard was in there and Dick Potts.

01:31.578 --> 01:32.839
Bill Pope. Did you appoint Ms. Patronella to? 
Yeah, I appointed her. I was associate director of

01:42.971 --> 01:48.197
the station, so I asked her to come over to be my 
secretary. And Dr. Patterson liked her, and so he

01:49.158 --> 01:54.644
moved her over to the dean's office. And so when I 
made dean, I moved over and joined her again.

02:00.181 --> 02:02.085
Describe her manner. HER MANNER IS ONE OF QUIET 
CONFIDENCE AND KNOWLEDGE. SHE'S BRIGHT.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.698
Vader is assistant to the dean. I had a little 
trouble doing that because some of the folks that

02:21.718 --> 02:32.753
were running the

02:21.718 --> 02:32.753
classification system were

02:35.804 --> 02:41.351
What was her manner of letting you know that she 
thought you might have made a mistake in a letter?

02:41.391 --> 02:41.912
She'd tell me. Is that right? Yes. She says, I think 
you want to change this. Elizabeth Williamson did

02:46.258 --> 02:47.820
that too. She says, I think you want to change this. 
Did they have a good sense of humor? Oh, yes. And I

02:53.247 --> 02:54.128
didn't mind it. You need to know me as a person. I 
generally... There are certain things that just

03:02.888 --> 03:04.831
irritated me. Such as? We can't do it. And any time I 
says, oh, you can't do it, and I'd say, why? And if

03:14.485 --> 03:18.891
the answer wasn't good, I'd blow my top. But I'd 
cool down. In that way, I was a little like John. And

03:22.456 --> 03:31.309
so if things basically irritated me, My ire was 
well known as far as this is concerned. When you

03:38.318 --> 03:44.286
left the office each day, each work day, did you 
take paperwork home with you? I took a briefcase

03:45.508 --> 03:47.811
home, but I didn't open it. Okay. What did you do in 
the evenings to relax? Well, I eventually came to

03:56.061 --> 04:01.228
the point where I was following TV and Had a drink or 
two. Do you have any hobbies? Any relaxation

04:06.532 --> 04:08.114
activities? No, the only hobby I have is probably a 
little of photography when I take trips and things

04:09.736 --> 04:17.207
of that sort. Because you're not a hunter, fisher, 
golfer, tennis. I'm not a hunter, fisher, golfer

04:19.750 --> 04:21.993
or anything of the sort. And you don't have a farm or 
anything like that? No. Let's see, church goer?

04:28.502 --> 04:29.023
Church goer. Where? Holy Cross Lutheran Church. 
Is that Evangelical or Missouri? That's

04:36.431 --> 04:37.011
Missouri. Missouri Synod. And you grew up in 
Missouri Synod? I grew up in Missouri Synod. I've

04:41.516 --> 04:46.462
been a lifelong Missouri Synod member. During 
those 20 years, about what percentage of the time

04:47.523 --> 04:54.030
were you on the road?

04:57.934 --> 05:00.257
At least 10% of the time. And where are some of the 
places overseas you went?

05:08.322 --> 05:10.605
Wherever we had a project going. South America, 
Sri Lanka, Africa,

05:10.665 --> 05:19.417
Saudi Arabia. Well, only one trip to Saudi Arabia. 
No, but I mean, did you go to East Pakistan,

05:23.102 --> 05:27.709
Bangladesh? I went to East Pakistan or 
Bangladesh, yes. Ever have any narrow escapes or

05:31.000 --> 05:37.353
scary moments on any of those trips? Yes. Where? 
Well, my wife and I were in Africa, and we were...

05:53.393 --> 06:17.123
Flying back to Nairobi,

05:53.393 --> 06:17.123
in Kenya, and the plane stopped off at a

05:53.393 --> 06:17.123
resort place just across the border. And we had a 
Coke. The pilot was one of them. It turned out that a

06:22.913 --> 06:32.146
lady decided to go with us, and she had more baggage 
than anything else, so we turned out to be an

06:22.913 --> 06:32.146
overweighted plane.

06:35.912 --> 06:38.796
And as we took off, there were three topis. 
Antelope. Excuse me.

06:46.287 --> 06:47.008
And... The pilot says, well, usually they get out 
of the way. We'll see what they do. And so we did, and

06:53.414 --> 06:56.199
the plane came up along with them. As the plane 
caught up with them, one went this way, one went

06:56.219 --> 07:00.666
into the plane. And the squawk button went off and 
things of the sort.

07:08.679 --> 07:09.561
We landed. We landed. in between spaces in a 
hard-bark place, but we came back and we found out

07:12.301 --> 07:28.682
that the plane was

07:12.301 --> 07:28.682
grounded because they had, the wheels were pushed 
aside.

07:31.405 --> 07:34.028
Oh, there were some interesting ones that I had. I 
went into, I was going into Africa and I joined my

07:42.035 --> 07:49.765
stepfather and

07:42.035 --> 07:49.765
mother-in-law, stepfather, mother-in-law, 
mother-in-law.

07:52.489 --> 08:00.439
We landed at Johannesburg Airport and we were 
waiting, we were going up to Victoria Falls.

08:04.385 --> 08:06.928
And they wouldn't take off. until late when we got 
there, we found that Zambian terrorists had shot

08:08.427 --> 08:12.453
up the airport.

08:15.718 --> 08:21.165
So I guess there are a few things of that sort to do.

08:21.866 --> 08:24.931
Any zany experiences on any one of those trips? 
Goofy? I'm sorry? Any zany, goofy? I don't know. On

08:30.138 --> 08:31.120
any of those trips?

08:34.925 --> 08:37.489
Who are some of the celebrities that you met?

08:40.321 --> 08:46.131
Most of the people were the people in the, well, 
celebrities. Like you, emperors, kings? No, I

08:50.718 --> 08:51.960
didn't. I did, as a result of a project, go down and 
meet Borgiba, who was president of Tunisia at one

08:51.980 --> 08:59.513
time. That was down in Houston.

09:03.541 --> 09:17.159
We were about to meet with Queen Elizabeth and 
Prince Philip at Kandy, Sri Lanka, but we were

09:03.541 --> 09:17.159
called back to Colombo beforehand, so we missed 
that opportunity. In overseas work, were there

09:18.221 --> 09:30.237
any projects that we missed that you wish we had 
been able to participate in? Any near misses?

09:33.815 --> 09:36.458
Well, I think there was a couple that we missed. I 
thought we should have gone into Kenya and

09:36.618 --> 09:43.025
Edgerton College and worked with those folks.

09:45.948 --> 09:54.257
We had a later opportunity to go with the 
agricultural, Bangladesh Agricultural

09:45.948 --> 09:54.257
University to go back in, and I think we missed 
that. Which of all those are you most proud to which

10:01.793 --> 10:03.776
of the projects? Oh, I think the Bangladesh 
Agricultural University is the one that they had

10:03.796 --> 10:11.607
the greatest impact in. But I think as far as 
foreign programs are concerned was the ones when

10:12.628 --> 10:21.801
we brought these young people in from the 
Dominican Republic. And they generally went home

10:21.821 --> 10:26.227
and the Aggie Club became a political force.

10:29.432 --> 10:30.433
And will be for years. Here,

10:32.253 --> 10:45.769
in your long service, of what are you most proud 
here at A&M for your years of service?

10:48.993 --> 10:54.480
Well, I think the research and extension center 
complex, which I put into place and focused on. I

10:55.237 --> 11:06.900
think the movement of the College of Agriculture 
to the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences,

10:55.237 --> 11:06.900
literally, not just by name only, is one that I'm 
particularly proud of. I think that in the later

11:07.572 --> 11:29.867
years after being dean, to establish, to work with 
and be a sort of a godfather to the movement of

11:07.572 --> 11:29.867
agricultural ethics in the country,

11:07.572 --> 11:29.867
that particular movement.

11:34.083 --> 11:47.598
I think some of the early graduate work, 
undergraduate students that I advised,

11:34.083 --> 11:47.598
I'm particularly proud of.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.784
Proud because of what they've gone on to achieve? 
What they've gone on to do as far as this is

11:52.804 --> 11:55.307
concerned. How did Aggie students change during 
your years here? The fundamental change It's a

12:04.508 --> 12:06.030
curious one, I can't explain it.

12:09.514 --> 12:20.728
When the students came back after World War II and 
taught, and then back in the 50s taught,

12:09.514 --> 12:20.728
the students were, they would go to class. They'd 
take 15, 16, 17 hours, take a full load.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.927
I'd drink a beer every once in a while, but that 
would be about it. They were very serious

12:37.290 --> 12:38.652
students.

12:45.621 --> 12:50.348
Today, students take no more than 12 hours. They 
just as soon have a class in which they don't have to

12:53.011 --> 12:58.579
go to class, the student. Their education, what 
they seek from education, is not the same thing

13:00.247 --> 13:10.654
that we thought, or that the students in the 50s and 
60s thought. They were seeking technical

13:10.895 --> 13:12.619
knowledge. The students here today are probably 
self-educating themselves or educating

13:14.017 --> 13:32.039
themselves more individually, which means, 
obviously, that a residential university is far

13:14.017 --> 13:32.039
better than this business of distance learning or 
whatever you want to call it.

13:36.143 --> 13:41.610
I think that

13:45.539 --> 13:54.147
In some ways, I guess they haven't changed, but 
there are some that are very interested in hard

13:45.539 --> 13:54.147
working and things of this sort. There are some 
that have the major ability that they can grasp

13:54.888 --> 14:00.894
points.

14:03.896 --> 14:04.397
Am I right? Oh, I think so. And also, I want to reach 
back. You mentioned people like Dick Potts and

14:09.562 --> 14:13.365
Curtis Lard. What was special about them? 
counselors, advisors like that? Well,

14:19.439 --> 14:22.142
particularly Dick Potts. He believed that you 
helped people get through college. And even if you

14:30.210 --> 14:37.819
put a dunderhead out, that dunderhead you'd never 
have to be embarrassed

14:30.210 --> 14:37.819
by. And I guess basically he was right.

14:42.458 --> 14:46.283
Am I correct that he knew when to make an exception 
to the rule and when not to? That's correct, yeah.

14:51.830 --> 14:53.292
And he was always patient? He was always patient.

14:58.579 --> 15:03.285
Let's see, other proud moments of all your years at 
A&M?

15:05.813 --> 15:12.521
Any big research projects that you're 
particularly proud to have been a part of? My

15:12.541 --> 15:14.644
research really never came to fruition. But for 
the college, what about? Oh, for the college, the

15:17.147 --> 15:32.125
biggest one is the so-called conversion project, 
where they took the grain sorghums of various

15:17.147 --> 15:32.125
sundry places and converted them just to things 
that could be used.

15:34.771 --> 15:42.102
could be used for in crops and breeding and things 
of the sort for the United States. I think that the

15:42.122 --> 16:00.930
major contribution that we did as far as the 
university is concerned is to change the

15:42.122 --> 16:00.930
structure

15:42.122 --> 16:00.930
of animal breeding, the meats projects as we have. 
And currently, I think the introduction of

16:01.450 --> 16:10.078
molecular biology in the university I'm 
particularly happy with.

16:16.665 --> 16:20.649
In hindsight, did we miss some opportunities? 
Probably. In agriculture? Probably. Such as?

16:28.676 --> 16:29.137
Who knows? We missed them. But so you don't have 
anything kind of filed away in your brain, oh, I

16:32.450 --> 16:38.104
wish we had known. I wish we had done so and so. Yeah. 
No, we did the best we could as far as it's

16:39.548 --> 16:42.595
concerned, probably. There were some things that 
we couldn't do. We didn't do as well as, for

16:45.100 --> 16:51.949
example, we couldn't do biochemistry as well as 
other places did. We missed some things in

16:52.731 --> 16:58.258
building a strong nutrition program and a human 
nutrition program. And I started because we had no

16:59.540 --> 17:06.029
history of home economics where human nutrition 
was in the play. As far as you know, when Mr. Rutter

17:09.338 --> 17:21.449
apparently decided we're going to give real 
emphasis to chemistry and economics.

17:22.250 --> 17:27.155
Were there any other areas that might have gotten 
his attention like those two did? No, I thought

17:28.756 --> 17:30.358
that was a good decision. And I'm assuming he 
thought that agriculture engineering didn't

17:30.418 --> 17:37.224
need that special attention. That's right. He was 
looking for the future where he could make it. If

17:42.836 --> 17:47.363
you don't mind to cut this off, I'm going to call my 
daughter real quick. I don't know. I

17:49.447 --> 17:55.396
see some things that bother me a little bit right 
now. Do you want to mention what they are? Well, I

18:01.195 --> 18:08.788
think the biggest problem that I see is that I 
remember the halcyon days of John Conley and Earl

18:01.195 --> 18:08.788
Rudder. And I do mention John Conley in that 
particular situation, where higher education in

18:09.669 --> 18:17.843
Texas was being supported largely. Today, higher 
education is squeezed. And in the process of

18:24.674 --> 18:26.798
squeezing, There is a beginning to be concerned 
among faculty members that the current

18:27.487 --> 18:42.287
organization is at fault.

18:42.307 --> 18:47.233
And if we had a department of food science, food 
science would fare better. We don't need to have

18:48.462 --> 19:00.615
the traditional animal husbandry because what we 
need to do is to have

18:48.462 --> 19:00.615
the scientific areas. Let's establish genomics, 
animal genomics, and use the genomics of

19:00.635 --> 19:07.283
nutrition and things of the sort. But maybe 
they're right. But what bothers me fundamentally

19:09.485 --> 19:16.613
is that there is a... a movement to establish a 
school of natural biosciences or natural

19:16.745 --> 19:26.238
resources, renewable natural resources.

19:29.202 --> 19:41.638
Essentially, I tried to get such a thing called to 
get the Institute of Renewable Natural Resources

19:29.202 --> 19:41.638
or something of that sort years ago.

19:43.424 --> 19:56.985
It never worked because the heads of departments 
and the faculty didn't want to have another

19:43.424 --> 19:56.985
administrative unit in between themselves and 
the administrators, that is the directors of the

19:43.424 --> 19:56.985
experiment station.

20:00.671 --> 20:05.378
But now with the shortage of money, maybe we can get 
more money if we have a school. They may be right.

20:09.412 --> 20:13.859
But essentially, where is the future? Who's 
sitting down to look at the future as far as

20:15.362 --> 20:19.629
agriculture is concerned? Who's sitting down to 
look at the future as far as science is concerned?

20:26.100 --> 20:35.335
And until the little green book says we've got to 
look at the future, we've got a changing future

20:26.100 --> 20:35.335
that we have to do. So it bothers me a lot. And the 
problem is the older faculty. They don't want to

20:44.119 --> 20:44.960
change. If you were hired as the consultant to 
Texas A&M University today, what advice would you

20:47.024 --> 20:59.482
give it and its leaders about moving forward? 
Well, I would say, Do what you're doing now, but

21:03.597 --> 21:14.072
still don't give up the older traditional parts of 
the university that may be a part of it. In other

21:14.132 --> 21:17.516
words, sit down and look at.

21:23.925 --> 21:26.288
And don't do it with a group of people. Don't do it 
with a whole faculty. Do it with leaders. Do it with

21:30.815 --> 21:32.457
small groups of people. Wherein you can have 18 
people was probably a maximum number as far as the

21:34.917 --> 21:45.347
research group of the century study. But you see, 
those things, those kinds of discussions aren't

21:47.109 --> 21:53.255
being done today.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.823
And there's just as many big problems out there as 
there are now.

22:03.925 --> 22:17.761
A large number of the faculty come from places that 
don't know about land grant universities and

22:03.925 --> 22:17.761
don't know about the service aspects of things. 
And right now, with the Bush administration

22:17.781 --> 22:31.317
moving toward NIH,

22:17.781 --> 22:31.317
particularly doing the research of NIH and 
squeezing everything else, How best in today's

22:33.136 --> 22:47.482
world could the research and teaching and service 
in agriculture, how could those functions best be

22:33.136 --> 22:47.482
put together?

22:50.408 --> 22:54.435
Well, theoretically they're put together where 
they ought to be right now. Is the current

22:55.242 --> 23:00.352
organization, is that the way you'd have it? 
That's right. But the problem is, are the people

23:01.073 --> 23:04.780
the right people? Now, Heiler has hired two people 
up front, which I have a high regard for. Charles

23:12.915 --> 23:17.183
Seifrich, he brought back, and Fuller Baser. By 
the way, Fuller Basler is one of these that you have

23:19.255 --> 23:26.662
to consider as being one of the stars we brought in.

23:30.385 --> 23:32.227
You have those two people there. But now 
Extension, we don't have the same kind of

23:33.208 --> 23:38.292
leadership in Extension. A visionary kind of 
thing. All right, would you have the chief

23:43.077 --> 23:48.722
academic administrator reporting both to the 
president and to the chancellor? It can be done. Is

23:54.859 --> 23:55.719
that the best way? That's the best way.

24:00.625 --> 24:09.235
What advice would you have to A&M's leadership 
about size? Should A&M be larger or smaller? in its

24:13.053 --> 24:15.596
enrollment and programming? I wish I knew the 
answer to that. As long as we were growing, we could

24:18.198 --> 24:21.222
do some things. The minute we put a cap on, you begin 
to put limits and you have to set priorities. And

24:29.250 --> 24:31.572
those priorities, are they the right priorities? 
I don't know. I don't think so.

24:37.619 --> 24:39.921
But is there the same kind of of unity, of feeling 
with 44,000 that there used to be? Oh, no. No. The

24:52.179 --> 24:58.185
faculty is more independent and more dispersed.

25:02.991 --> 25:08.997
For example, during the work day, if you wanted to 
walk across the campus encounter some other

25:09.685 --> 25:12.329
faculty members, where did you go? You want to go 
have coffee?

25:18.860 --> 25:19.862
Well, I don't know. Did you all used to go to the MSC? 
We used to go to the MSC, but they don't do it

25:22.987 --> 25:25.432
anymore. We have coffee here, as far as it's 
concerned. When they designed this building, I

25:29.318 --> 25:33.465
put a lounge in here. And with the idea that somehow 
the faculty could get together. It never worked.

25:41.309 --> 25:44.353
It didn't work because somebody wanted a living 
room. They wanted a place to bring people in. They

25:46.115 --> 25:51.642
wanted to have meeting rooms rather than societal 
situations. There's this great fear that the

25:52.123 --> 25:57.850
faculty is going to get lazy and do some other 
things. All right, now we're backing up. In 1988,

26:02.398 --> 26:08.969
when you left the dean's function, did you retire 
at that point? No, I came over as a full-time

26:09.831 --> 26:11.994
faculty. As a full-time faculty. And who 
succeeded you? Charles Harnson. Did he or anyone

26:17.544 --> 26:22.352
else ask you for any advice at that point? As far as I 
know, he was advised not to seek my advice. Oh, I

26:26.586 --> 26:29.290
see, I see. Which I think was an error because I 
didn't think that, I didn't think as differently

26:29.771 --> 26:37.683
from him as some people might have. Now, and did you 
have, the timing of your ceasing as dean, was that

26:37.743 --> 26:47.277
caused by your having some disagreements with 
somebody? No, I was 65 years old. Oh, so it's a 65.

26:51.021 --> 26:51.281
Okay. And so they decided, and basically they, 
okay, he's 65, we ought to get on, we need to put the

26:51.682 --> 27:04.821
dean's job and the director's job and the deputy 
chancellor's job, or title at least, in one place.

27:04.981 --> 27:08.426
And those were separated at that point, I think. 
And it took them a decade or so to put them back

27:08.446 --> 27:12.792
together? I think it was all right to put them back 
together. No, no, but it took them 10 years, didn't

27:16.887 --> 27:22.675
it, to put them back together? Yes. What have we not 
talked about that we should have? I've run out of

27:25.118 --> 27:27.420
topics that I've thought of. Well, I think I have 
expressed most of my feelings as far as this is

27:30.044 --> 27:34.769
concerned, most of my thinking. I think that Texas

27:36.091 --> 27:42.559
A&M still has some possibilities. of becoming 
great, it may change its character.

27:52.449 --> 27:57.876
I really don't know what colleges of agriculture 
ought to be in the future. And I'm thinking of that

27:59.178 --> 28:01.000
more than anything else. I know what universities 
ought to be in the future. And that's generally an

28:05.366 --> 28:09.492
organization without a college of agriculture.

28:12.087 --> 28:27.891
And so colleges of agriculture who want to survive 
have to fit within that particular conceptual

28:12.087 --> 28:27.891
basis of being in a university as far as that's 
concerned. And who has done that best? Cornell? I

28:32.798 --> 28:34.721
don't think anybody has done it best. Okay.

28:40.090 --> 28:40.390
All right. Back to you again personally. 
Individual special moments that are your

28:44.017 --> 28:54.354
greatest pleasures while you were, was it getting 
that watch? Yes. I had, of course, this was my

28:54.975 --> 28:58.441
second watch. This was administration. I got one 
as teaching. Oh, okay. Yes, that was it. Recently,

29:05.660 --> 29:15.809
last fall,

29:05.660 --> 29:15.809
I was named one of the outstanding graduates of 
Texas A&M's College of Agriculture and Life

29:05.660 --> 29:15.809
Sciences. That's splendid.

29:19.692 --> 29:32.584
I think, looking back upon the Research and 
Extension Center concept, I think changing the

29:19.692 --> 29:32.584
name of the college to College of Agriculture and 
Life Sciences

29:37.188 --> 29:43.855
And there were some things that I tried I thought 
were pretty good ideas, but they were quite sold.

29:44.996 --> 29:56.529
For example, I tried to get people to think about 
the Master of Agriculture as a system sort of like

29:44.996 --> 29:56.529
an MBA program. But science so dominates the 
thinking of faculty that

30:07.175 --> 30:13.744
To whom do you feel greatest gratitude for your A&M 
years?

30:17.229 --> 30:22.396
People that helped you, that made your work? Well,

30:22.516 --> 30:36.456
the first person would be

30:22.516 --> 30:36.456
Pearson.

30:40.030 --> 30:43.293
Paul Pearson. He was the first head of the 
Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition. He was

30:45.775 --> 30:50.759
dean of graduate college at that particular 
point. Carl Lyman probably helped me as much as

30:52.781 --> 30:56.344
anybody. Jack Miller.

31:01.448 --> 31:09.615
Obviously

31:01.448 --> 31:09.615
Earl Rudder.

31:11.873 --> 31:13.195
Leon S. Bill Pope.

31:20.625 --> 31:21.306
Jack Williams. I'd even listen to her in that 
crowd.

31:31.520 --> 31:35.146
Alright, summarize your feelings about A&M in a 
sentence or so. Well, I think it's an institution

31:37.208 --> 31:40.513
that is
