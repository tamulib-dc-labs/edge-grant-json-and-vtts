WEBVTT

00:05.937 --> 00:08.439
It's the 24th of July, 1987. We're at the Hyatt 
Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri. And I'm here with

00:14.925 --> 00:21.010
Ellen Black from the faculty of the University of 
Kansas at Lawrence.

00:22.952 --> 00:28.277
Ellen, would you tell us a little bit about your 
background? Well, I grew up in the Boston area. And

00:30.779 --> 00:35.623
I went to Harvard and majored in philosophy.

00:36.143 --> 00:51.761
And after graduation, I started out as a newspaper 
reporter and worked at that for six years,

00:36.143 --> 00:51.761
starting out with a very small weekly paper and 
kept changing jobs and gradually moved up. And

00:51.781 --> 00:59.249
after a couple of years, I became a sports editor of 
a small daily paper in Middletown, New York. And

01:00.511 --> 01:04.395
then in 1955, I decided to go to California And I got 
a job as sports editor of the Hayward paper,

01:05.303 --> 01:14.293
Hayward, California, which was only about 15,000 
people at that time. I guess it's over 100,000

01:15.474 --> 01:17.116
today. I think so. Yeah. That wasn't a very good 
job, and I only kept that for a number of months. But

01:23.643 --> 01:32.033
then I was fortunate enough to get a good job with 
the San Jose Mercury, which is quite a large, large

01:23.643 --> 01:32.033
paper. And I worked on it about two and a half years. 
During that time I became rather disillusioned

01:35.155 --> 01:43.586
with reporting and at the same time became quite 
interested in city planning. City planning in the

01:44.607 --> 01:48.492
Bay Area then was a popular topic. Yeah, well it was 
a time of tremendous growth and a lot of problems

01:48.512 --> 02:00.808
coming from it and as a general reporter, which I 
was for the Mercury, about About half of the news is

02:02.037 --> 02:06.622
police news, and about half is local government. 
And 2% or 3% fit it in for odd things. And I would say

02:11.889 --> 02:18.917
at least half of the local government news had 
something to do with planning or land use

02:11.889 --> 02:18.917
development. I was technically interested in 
Fremont, where I started and lived for about a

02:19.498 --> 02:25.184
year. And they decided to employ a couple of 
reporters there because they're just

02:25.224 --> 02:31.572
incorporated as a city. And one of the first things 
that city council did was to hire a planning

02:32.682 --> 02:41.916
consultant to draw a comprehensive plan for 
Fremont. And that consultant was Harold Wise, and

02:41.936 --> 02:53.393
quite a complicated story that happened that's 
not really relevant here, but it was quite an

02:41.936 --> 02:53.393
interesting plan, and a lot of it was carried out. 
Who was the planning director? Well, they did a

02:56.818 --> 02:59.162
nationwide search. They had a search for a city 
manager first, and then for the planning

03:00.678 --> 03:13.258
director, and the person who was hired was named 
Dick Wilkinson, who had done his master's degree

03:00.678 --> 03:13.258
at Oklahoma. And they later on went to Redwood 
City, I think. I don't know what happened to him. I

03:19.387 --> 03:20.369
lost track of him. Who took over after Dick? Do you 
know? I think Roy Potter. Roy Potter.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.221
He's in San Diego now. Yeah, I've lost track of most 
of those California people. But I used to know a lot

03:31.625 --> 03:35.169
of the planning directors around the Bay Area. 
After that, I moved to the Peninsula office and

03:36.270 --> 03:45.619
mostly covered Mountain View and Los Gatos. Los 
Altos. Los Altos. Right.

03:50.744 --> 03:53.366
Lawrence Livingston was a consultant in Los 
Altos. I got to know him a bit. Do you know Bill

03:55.148 --> 03:56.149
Spangle? uh only very slightly you know there was 
let's say there were two directors in mountain

03:57.158 --> 04:22.457
view uh i think the first one was named george 
brenner and then he was succeeded by dick gamble

03:57.158 --> 04:22.457
and again i'm not sure they're probably still in 
california somewhere dick gamble's dead is that

03:57.158 --> 04:22.457
right he worked for the uh bunny department of san 
francisco and I met him when we were both employed

04:22.741 --> 04:28.647
with Wilsey Hammond Blair in Foster City, but he 
died. I didn't know that. So along about the

04:31.690 --> 04:44.043
beginning of 1958, I decided I'd leave newspaper 
field and go to graduate school and get a master's

04:31.690 --> 04:44.043
degree in planning. And so I applied to several 
schools, and I was Really interested in going to

04:49.403 --> 04:55.471
Berkeley, and they accepted me, but they didn't 
offer me any financial aid. After working all

04:55.491 --> 04:57.954
those years, you needed financial aid? Reporters 
don't get paid very much. Only in the Mercury, I was

05:00.437 --> 05:02.600
in a union job. I mean, I started out with that $40 a 
week when I graduated from Harvard. Boy.

05:11.852 --> 05:14.095
And I gradually, when I... Got into the mercury. 
Overnight, my salary went up a lot. But even so, I

05:20.064 --> 05:24.829
think at the time I left, I was only making a little 
over $5,000 a year. So I really hadn't saved very

05:25.810 --> 05:27.232
much. Well, I think I was offered a research 
assistantship by North Carolina, and I decided to

05:29.755 --> 05:36.983
go there because of that. Although I think, if I 
recall, the amount was $1,800. for the

05:41.378 --> 05:44.163
assistantship, which seemed like a lot of money at 
that time. Well, they probably waived your

05:44.203 --> 05:46.246
tuition, too. I got a reduction. I think I got 
in-state tuition, which was fairly nominal.

05:50.493 --> 05:50.713
Yeah. But I didn't like it very much at North 
Carolina. Part of the personal thing that I was

05:58.165 --> 06:02.172
research assistant to Peter Nash. And he ran into 
some trouble in the middle of the year and had to

06:02.945 --> 06:11.999
resign from the faculty. And he left at the end of 
that year. What happened? Well, Peter, that's

06:15.744 --> 06:20.371
quite a long story. So you left North Carolina and 
then you? I went out, I believe, at Christmas time

06:25.559 --> 06:31.348
on vacation and went and talked to Jack Kent. to see 
if I could transfer. And he agreed to give me full

06:34.540 --> 06:37.725
credits for the year at North Carolina. So in June, 
I packed up and left Chapel Hill. And I did an

06:44.295 --> 06:50.344
internship in San Jose, Santa Clara County, in 
that summer. And then I did my second year at

06:50.504 --> 06:52.107
Berkeley. That was with Michael Antonacci in 
Santa Clara County? No. No, he was the city

06:56.313 --> 06:58.016
planning director. That's right. He was with San 
Jose. He was with Carl. Belser. Carl Belser's

07:01.706 --> 07:06.152
agency, right.

07:06.172 --> 07:07.494
I knew Carl quite well. Well, I worked more with Roy 
Cameron, who later became the director. Now, Carl

07:11.400 --> 07:13.883
was hot on agricultural zoning at that time. Yes, 
he was. I really didn't have much to do with him.

07:18.069 --> 07:21.014
Well, it was quite a big agency even then. There 
were like 40 people in the planning center. Yes, I

07:24.539 --> 07:30.407
think that they had the reputation of being one of 
the finest county planning departments in the

07:24.539 --> 07:30.407
United States. That's right.

07:34.103 --> 07:36.105
So after your internship in the summer, then? Then 
I did my second year at Berkeley. And you're

07:39.529 --> 07:42.492
interested in Jack Kent, I think. Well, anyone 
that you can stand on that, particularly.

07:49.159 --> 07:55.706
Well, Jack sort of picked me out from the students 
and got me interested in the general plan. And I

07:57.127 --> 08:02.473
agreed to find out to write a master's thesis on it 
It was after I'd been there about three months or

08:03.550 --> 08:06.813
so. And

08:06.833 --> 08:14.781
at the time, there was an option between taking a 
comprehensive exam and doing a thesis. And

08:15.402 --> 08:20.367
everybody took the exam, but I decided to do a 
thesis. When I was there, they didn't have the

08:20.767 --> 08:23.170
option. It changed shortly after that.

08:29.156 --> 08:31.318
You had to do a thesis. Yeah. Well, I read your 
thesis at the time. I remember that. Oh, you did?

08:35.500 --> 08:36.521
Didn't you do it under Kenyon? I thought the 
general plan was on somewhere, wasn't it? Yes, it

08:38.925 --> 08:39.466
was. You needn't have read it, though. I mean, 
there wasn't much to it.

08:45.915 --> 08:49.140
It was the Metropolitan Open Space in the San 
Francisco Bay region. All right.

08:53.886 --> 08:54.027
Mm-hmm. So Jack was- I know what happened. What 
they did was there were so many people that weren't

08:55.909 --> 09:01.557
getting their degrees because they never 
finished their thesis. Right. that they opened it

09:02.208 --> 09:06.634
up for an option to take a comp exam. So at least 
these people could get a degree to get out of there.

09:10.860 --> 09:15.306
That's a universal problem in planning schools 
everywhere I've been. Well, I think there were 20

09:15.326 --> 09:19.392
that graduated my class. I think 18 took the exam. 
And two took the thesis. And the other one besides

09:23.838 --> 09:26.682
me was Alan Blackman. I don't think he ever 
finished. Alan Blackman? I don't think he ever got

09:30.608 --> 09:34.572
his degree.

09:37.615 --> 09:53.813
So Jack was very insecure about his writing and was 
particularly interested in me because I had been a

09:37.615 --> 09:53.813
journalist and he was impressed with my writing.

09:53.933 --> 09:58.017
So I finished my thesis in the summer after the 
second year and got my degree. Wait a minute, what

10:01.878 --> 10:03.100
was the topic? It was called Functions of the Urban 
General Plan, I think. Functions of the Urban

10:07.847 --> 10:09.189
General Plan. What was the date then? That was 
1960. I think I got my degree in October of 1960.

10:19.765 --> 10:25.253
And then I took a job in Chicago with a 
transportation study there. With CATS? With

10:26.586 --> 10:30.070
CATS, Chicago Area Transportation Study. And 
that started me in the transportation field,

10:30.090 --> 10:35.376
which has been my special area ever since. That was 
purely accidental. I never took a course in that at

10:39.380 --> 10:41.923
Berkeley. I think I had one course, a required 
course, in traffic engineering at North

10:41.943 --> 10:48.450
Carolina. I mostly wanted to do research. I got 
quite interested in statistics. And this agency

10:53.196 --> 10:55.138
was... was known as a research-oriented agency. 
Mel Weber had promoted it very much. He was more

11:00.592 --> 11:05.518
research-oriented than anybody else at Berkeley 
at that time.

11:08.261 --> 11:17.952
So I kind of moved into that, and the first few 
papers I did were fairly statistical,

11:08.261 --> 11:17.952
mathematical. In the meantime, as John Kent 
pushed along on writing his book, So I think he'd

11:26.573 --> 11:30.758
sort of been working on them for about 10 years, 
little by little. 10 years? I think so. He had

11:33.882 --> 11:34.723
different things. He'd write papers, and then 
he'd put it aside. This will be part of the book, and

11:37.107 --> 11:40.591
so forth. But in the early 60s, he really kind of put 
it together. And I don't know. Maybe he took a

11:49.502 --> 11:51.104
sabbatical or something. I'm not really sure. But 
he asked me if I'd be co-author with him. And I

11:55.902 --> 12:02.593
thought about it for a while, and I declined, 
because I really wasn't interested in the subject

11:55.902 --> 12:02.593
much anymore. And

12:02.633 --> 12:08.844
so he went ahead on his own, and he got a publisher. 
And he used to send me to some material to comment

12:10.086 --> 12:16.296
on, which I did. I just noticed in my files that I had 
quite a few letters, long letters from him. And

12:23.594 --> 12:35.029
however, what happened, you asked me on the phone, 
I guess, last week about did Kent steal my ideas and

12:23.594 --> 12:35.029
all. And that really wouldn't be accurate. The 
ideas basically were his. And I think I suggested

12:40.737 --> 12:49.268
some refinements in some of them, some of which he 
accepted and then took into his own. But they were

12:49.288 --> 12:51.171
fairly minor things. What he did really was he 
stole my writing. And when the book finally was

12:55.481 --> 13:02.707
completed and came out, it's divided into five 
chapters. And two of the chapters essentially

13:03.668 --> 13:07.011
were copied out of my master's thesis. Which were 
they? I'd have to look at the book and see. I forgot.

13:13.076 --> 13:15.218
One of them does deal with the functions. The other 
might be a... Uses and characteristics? I think

13:21.053 --> 13:22.335
that might be his. He had that pretty well 
developed. I kind of worked on a part of his

13:25.700 --> 13:31.429
thinking that he hadn't developed very much. I 
think when he started, he had three functions, and

13:32.130 --> 13:35.975
I added two more. I think one of them was education, 
I remember. I think the other chapter he took was a

13:40.803 --> 13:44.428
kind of background chapter. about the different 
forms of government and the role of city manager.

13:49.660 --> 13:52.623
Now the things about the Standard City Enabling 
Act, that's all his. Yeah, that was the second

13:52.803 --> 13:55.866
chapter. Essentially what he did was he took my 
thesis and treated it as though it was his first

13:57.427 --> 14:02.252
draft. And he'd make some changes and things, but 
there are lots of paragraphs that are word for word

14:04.414 --> 14:13.082
the same.

14:13.248 --> 14:15.912
It's what we call plagiarism today. We don't let 
students do it. Exactly. And you can be kicked out

14:19.296 --> 14:21.099
of Harvard for doing it. Yes. Well, that would be 
the first chapter then. No, I'm not sure it's the

14:25.985 --> 14:27.267
first. I'd have to look at it again. I haven't 
looked at it for many years. Well, it's the urban

14:29.931 --> 14:36.359
plan, the government, and the planning process or 
something like that, the first chapter. Well,

14:37.220 --> 14:37.781
whatever. Yeah. So that, as I say, I didn't think 
there was much I could do about that since I was kind

14:40.096 --> 14:50.010
of nobody, and he was a very important person in the 
field and all. But that kind of chilled our

14:50.551 --> 14:56.039
relationship, and I never really had much to do 
with him since then. I didn't realize what he was

14:56.099 --> 14:59.564
going to do. Yeah. Too bad. OK. Well, let's see. I 
want to get back now. So you were at Katz. Yes, okay,

15:08.750 --> 15:22.267
so I worked there about three years, and then I got a 
Fulbright grant to study in the Netherlands as a

15:08.750 --> 15:22.267
student grant, not a faculty grant like we had or a 
scholar grant. And I was at Delft at the

15:23.229 --> 15:26.713
technological school. Then when I came back, I 
went to work in New York City for what was then

15:27.915 --> 15:37.407
called the Tri-State Transportation 
Commission. And both of those translation

15:38.163 --> 15:42.850
studies were directed by Douglas Carroll. And he 
had been director in Chicago, and he then moved to

15:44.212 --> 15:47.917
New York. And I guess I was one of about five people 
that eventually moved from Chicago to New York

15:49.119 --> 15:55.287
with him. So in between, I had a year in Europe. So I 
worked there till 1968, and in 1967, Paul Davidoff

16:08.774 --> 16:12.318
asked me to teach a class at Hunter College. And he 
had recently become famous for advocacy planning

16:13.700 --> 16:23.032
and had been asked to start a program at Hunter. He 
was a professor at Penn at the time. He had written

16:26.095 --> 16:29.520
his famous articles. I believe I met him at Penn 
when I was there. Could be, yeah. And when he was a

16:34.646 --> 16:35.507
student. That could be, yeah. Of course, he has a 
law degree, too, or he did have. Of course, he's

16:39.537 --> 16:42.201
deceased now. So they wanted a course in 
transportation planning. And they were getting a

16:46.487 --> 16:54.137
lot of complaints from their students that their 
program wasn't practical. It was very

16:54.458 --> 16:56.841
ideological, which of course it was. And so he 
tried to hire some practitioners. And so I taught

17:02.369 --> 17:05.393
an evening course in transportation planning. 
And I enjoyed it very much. I really got a kick out of

17:07.415 --> 17:08.917
that. And so I decided to go into teaching. And I 
knew I had to get a PhD to do that. And I also had some

17:18.287 --> 17:26.196
consciousness of inadequacies in my background. 
I didn't think I knew enough about economics. I

17:29.720 --> 17:34.705
would go to conferences, and I wouldn't 
understand some of these papers that were given

17:29.720 --> 17:34.705
there. So I applied to several schools again, and I 
decided to go to Cornell, largely because Barclay

17:37.216 --> 17:46.286
Jones was there. I knew Barclay at Berkeley. Well, 
I didn't really know him very well, because the

17:49.249 --> 17:52.853
year I was there, he was on sabbatical. Oh. And 
while he was in town, he was working with Steve

17:54.314 --> 18:03.504
Jacobs on their study of the historic 
preservation of San Francisco. But he didn't

18:04.004 --> 18:06.447
teach any courses. I think he taught a course for 
architecture students, but none for planning

18:07.152 --> 18:11.078
students. So I only knew him slightly. Then the 
other connection I had with him was Pierre Clavel,

18:14.042 --> 18:23.355
who had been in North Carolina with me, he and his 
wife. And they had, in the meantime, gone up to

18:25.038 --> 18:27.361
Cornell. He had gotten a PhD at Cornell. So when I 
went to Cornell, he was a professor there. And

18:34.632 --> 18:36.855
really, the main thing he had I mean, I considered 
going back to Berkeley, too, and almost did that.

18:42.418 --> 18:44.521
But I finally decided to go to Cornell. Did you know 
John Reps at Cornell? No, I didn't. I never took a

18:49.347 --> 18:50.749
course from him. Cornell faculty was divided into 
two factions, the traditionalists and the

18:51.330 --> 18:58.400
modernists. And I was with the modernists. And in 
fact, it came down, really, that it was kind of Reps

19:00.663 --> 19:05.290
against Barclay Jones. Really? I think there was a 
period, a couple of years, they didn't speak to

19:05.983 --> 19:11.407
each other, although I think their offices were 
adjacent. Oh, dear. I know both of them, and I

19:13.729 --> 19:16.632
admire both of them. Well, yeah, they're both very 
talented people and all, but they have very

19:17.132 --> 19:27.962
different ideas about some things.

19:28.302 --> 19:34.568
So, well, actually, while I was at, I guess I lived 
in Ithaca for four years. And last year, I taught on

19:35.037 --> 19:36.979
the faculty. I had a one-year appointment for a 
professor who was on leave. And that year,

19:43.025 --> 19:46.188
actually, the department split into two separate 
departments. And one of them that I was an

19:47.890 --> 19:55.397
instructor in was called Policy Planning and 
Regional Analysis. And it was the quantitative

19:56.778 --> 19:59.902
one. And Barclay Jones was the chairman of that. 
He'd never been able to get to be chairman before.

20:05.092 --> 20:08.377
because he had so many enemies in the faculty. And 
the other one was called Urban Planning and

20:09.438 --> 20:13.284
Development. It was pretty much a traditional 
land use planning program. And Stuart Stein was

20:17.470 --> 20:20.234
the chair of that one. Why did Barclay have so many 
enemies? He's such a pleasant chap. Well,

20:25.682 --> 20:27.024
Barclay's kind of a schemer. Is he? And he's always 
doing things behind the scenes. Over the years,

20:33.644 --> 20:41.014
he's kind of built up his friends and his enemies.

20:41.695 --> 20:48.945
I don't know exactly whatever happened between he 
and Reps, but they had a falling out. And there was

20:49.486 --> 20:56.535
certain faculty that lined up with Reps and 
certain ones that lined up with Barkley. When I

20:56.555 --> 20:59.179
first met Reps, I asked him if he knew Barkley. And

20:59.885 --> 21:08.216
I had known him quite well at Berkeley before he 
went to Cornell. And Rebs was very polite about it.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.603
He said yes, he knew him. Period. Well, of course, 
Barclay was an architect. And as I remember, at

21:18.451 --> 21:26.942
Berkeley, he gave a course in urban aesthetics, 
which I think was an elective course, but it was

21:18.451 --> 21:26.942
quite popular. But all that time, he was writing 
his dissertation, which was at North Carolina. He

21:32.933 --> 21:36.197
went on in economics at North Carolina. He got his 
master's in planning there. And he went out and

21:41.163 --> 21:52.678
took that job at Berkeley and went back every 
summer for five years to write his dissertation.

21:52.778 --> 21:57.364
And he finally finished it, I think, in 61. And at 
that point, basically shifted either then or when

21:57.952 --> 22:13.028
he went to Cornell, which was a year or two later, 
shifted his orientation and put architecture all

21:57.952 --> 22:13.028
behind him and went in for economics. Incredible. 
So many people at Cornell, not knowing his

22:14.429 --> 22:23.799
background, wouldn't believe you if you said he 
was an architect. Yeah, because he and Jacobs were

22:27.753 --> 22:29.034
Doing a lot of collaborations. Yes, and I think 
Jacobs went first at Cornell, I think. And I think

22:34.459 --> 22:35.840
Barclay went a year later. Steve died some years 
ago. He was playing squash at Cornell. OK,

22:43.907 --> 22:51.614
so then you were teaching at Cornell. And then what 
happened? I had this one-year appointment.

22:56.491 --> 23:01.157
The professor came back, and Barclay couldn't 
find anything else for me. And Roger Creighton had

23:02.399 --> 23:07.826
been trying to get me to go work for him for some 
time. And he had been with me in Chicago.

23:13.854 --> 23:17.859
Carol was the director of the Chicago study, and 
Roger Creighton was the assistant director.

23:20.623 --> 23:22.605
And then later, he didn't go to New York City. He 
went to upstate New York. And he moved to Albany.

23:29.122 --> 23:34.269
And he and John Hamburg both moved from Chicago to 
Albany. And they ran the upstate New York

23:34.289 --> 23:39.816
transportation studies, the first big one in 
Buffalo. And they did Rochester, Syracuse, all

23:40.297 --> 23:43.081
the cities. And then Roger and John eventually 
left and started a consulting firm in Albany

23:44.182 --> 23:52.013
called Creighton Hamburg Incorporated. And so 
Roger came in the middle of the year that I was

23:53.579 --> 24:00.185
teaching. I guess that would be like in January of 
72. And he made me a firm offer for a job. And Barclay

24:08.053 --> 24:14.238
Jones just couldn't make any commitments at 
Cornell. He just didn't have a faculty line open.

24:17.261 --> 24:23.367
And so I took the job in Albany and went off there 
work half-time and write my dissertation the

24:23.718 --> 24:29.788
other half-time.

24:30.489 --> 24:31.892
What was your dissertation topic? Well, it's 
quite a mathematical study on mass transit. It's

24:35.879 --> 24:39.184
on optimizing the design of mass transit systems. 
And I worked on it five years in the end. And it's

24:44.413 --> 24:45.254
huge. It's over 700 pages. It was the longest one 
they'd ever had at Cornell, or I think somebody's

24:48.642 --> 24:55.869
passed it since then.

24:58.552 --> 25:00.674
David Johnson had one almost as long. I think a 
fellow's at Tennessee now. This was about 600 and

25:05.659 --> 25:10.544
some pages, I think. So you got your PhD. So, well, I 
worked... My original arrangement was that I

25:15.203 --> 25:23.213
would work alternate weeks, but that never works 
out. And I became responsible for a contract

25:24.014 --> 25:32.484
working on a transfer proposal for the west side of 
Manhattan. It was part of the West Side Highway

25:33.425 --> 25:42.055
Project, which was the biggest contract that 
Creighton had at that time. And it was so much

25:43.334 --> 25:52.024
pressure and all that I went a long time without 
working on my dissertation at all.

25:56.029 --> 26:06.962
Sometimes I had to go to New York every day, every 
week for meetings and all, which was a three hour

25:56.029 --> 26:06.962
train ride each

25:56.029 --> 26:06.962
way. But that was my really only exposure to the 
world of politics, although it was bureaucratic

26:09.490 --> 26:15.797
politics. But my other jobs had been very 
sheltered. They were really, even though they

26:19.001 --> 26:23.986
were with government agencies, they were really 
academic-type research jobs. I never met the

26:24.927 --> 26:27.971
public or elected officials. But my work, I have to 
say, that was my one consulting experience, my one

26:29.272 --> 26:35.599
real experience. I did learn an awful lot about the 
real world that I didn't know about before. But I

26:42.781 --> 26:51.593
finally came to a point where

26:42.781 --> 26:51.593
I had to decide whether I was going to finish my 
dissertation or forget about it. And at one time,

26:52.414 --> 26:57.681
then, Norm offered me a job in Cleveland to be his 
assistant. And then I kind of had to decide,

26:58.863 --> 27:04.049
because I knew if I took that job in Cleveland, I 
could forget about the dissertation. But I turned

27:04.930 --> 27:06.092
it down. and decided to go ahead and finish the 
dissertation. And so I finally resigned from

27:09.636 --> 27:13.161
Creighton Hamburg. And I just sort of holed up in my 
apartment in Albany and just worked straight

27:14.202 --> 27:19.089
through the dissertation. Let's see, this would 
be in 1974.

27:25.156 --> 27:29.742
And I guess it took about eight months, finally. 
And I had to do a lot of computer runs. So I used to run

27:31.985 --> 27:35.590
back to Cornell to use the computer there. I 
usually stayed with Pierre and Ann Clavell. And

27:39.757 --> 27:42.441
they were very generous to me through the years. 
And basically, even if they went away on vacation,

27:42.541 --> 27:49.269
they let me stay in their house for a week at a time. 
So finally, I completed a whole draft just before

27:51.552 --> 27:59.222
Christmas in 1974. And then, knowing this was 
going to happen, I sort of looked around for a job.

28:07.177 --> 28:09.519
because I felt I could go to work in January. But 
there usually weren't very many jobs, but it just

28:10.801 --> 28:23.233
so happened that Kyle Goldschmidt was looking for 
a fill-in for two quarters starting in January of

28:10.801 --> 28:23.233
75 at Michigan State. And it was only a half-time 
position, teaching one course a quarter. But it

28:30.280 --> 28:34.804
was something, it was experience, and so I I took 
that position and

28:35.324 --> 28:43.892
went out and spent about six months in Lansing. And 
had

28:45.733 --> 28:49.356
trouble. I didn't get along there very well. There 
were kind of these three old men on the faculty. And

28:54.721 --> 28:58.725
actually, my line, my position was one of Myles 
Boylan's. It was his line. And he did a research

29:00.646 --> 29:02.047
grant. And so he bought himself off. for one 
semester, or two quarters. They had a quarter

29:07.197 --> 29:11.203
system.

29:11.223 --> 29:15.949
So I didn't really get along with Miles and the 
other two older faculty. And it became obvious

29:16.950 --> 29:20.234
that I couldn't stay there. So I went out looking 
for a job again. And meanwhile, I had my

29:25.060 --> 29:28.865
dissertation hearing, and I passed that. And I 
lined up a typist to type 700 pages. But

29:35.078 --> 29:50.719
I guess I was able to, I got two job offers then from 
George Washington University, which is where my

29:35.078 --> 29:50.719
brother teaches, and from Texas. And I decided to 
take the one in Texas. And so I moved down to Texas in

29:54.684 --> 29:58.369
the summer of 75. That was when John Gallery was the 
chair of the planning program. From

30:05.732 --> 30:06.513
Pennsylvania. Yeah, from the Philadelphia area. 
The search committee was Jim Hotling and Sandy

30:10.517 --> 30:19.387
Rosenbloom and a student. I went down there and 
they interviewed me. I liked it quite well there,

30:22.790 --> 30:29.638
so I decided to pick that one.

30:30.175 --> 30:34.580
Well, not only my brother, but my mother was living 
in the Washington area. Very disappointed I

30:35.301 --> 30:40.127
didn't take the job at George Washington.

30:43.391 --> 30:49.038
So I moved down, and my dissertation got finished. 
The typist would mail off sections from, she was at

30:50.560 --> 30:59.811
Ithaca, would mail off chapters that she finished 
typing them, and then I would correct them.

31:00.770 --> 31:05.938
Finally, at the end, about the last week, I hired a 
Kelly girl to work for me to finish up the

31:00.770 --> 31:05.938
corrections. And then I finally put it together 
and mailed it off, and it got there on the deadline.

31:12.187 --> 31:15.793
So I think the last day of my seven-year limit. You 
had seven years to complete your work for a

31:16.233 --> 31:18.998
doctorate. And I just made it. This was in 
September of 75. That's when my doctorate was

31:24.205 --> 31:27.250
officially awarded. Good planning.

31:33.036 --> 31:38.243
So that puts me in Texas. Yes, with John Gallery and 
Sandy Rosenblum and so forth. Yes, and the others

31:42.569 --> 31:51.921
in the faculty were Peter Coleman and Terry Kahn. 
And my line, my position had been held by Ray

31:51.941 --> 31:56.967
Parkins, who was a black professor. And I'm not 
sure when he came, I met him. He was also, I think, a

32:01.477 --> 32:06.703
minister. And maybe both a divinity degree and a 
law degree. He was very active in the state

32:11.928 --> 32:14.651
legislature. And I understand he had some 
contacts and some of the legislators and

32:16.173 --> 32:26.143
apparently got certain housing passed with 
regard, certain bills passed with regard to

32:16.173 --> 32:26.143
housing. that was before i went there i don't know 
much about it he was offered a position at the

32:27.305 --> 32:50.595
university of tennessee and left and that created 
the vacancy that i feel how long were you at texas i

32:27.305 --> 32:50.595
would say six years from 75 to 1981.

32:27.305 --> 32:50.595
and then after gallery went back to philadelphia 
there were some changes in the structure. I could

32:54.303 --> 32:57.627
even go back, if you want, and tell you what I know 
about what was there. Of course, the program was

32:57.867 --> 33:01.711
started by Hugo Leipziger Pierce. Yes. I've 
interviewed Hugo. Okay, I wasn't sure whether he

33:04.214 --> 33:06.416
was still alive. Oh, yes. He must be in his late 80s. 
He's still a very viable guy. And Martha. Martha, I

33:16.207 --> 33:20.311
think, was a student of his, and I believe she's 
quite a lot younger. Yes. maybe even 20 years. I

33:26.209 --> 33:29.032
think Hugo went there either during or after World 
War II. Well, I have that all documented. You know

33:31.054 --> 33:32.015
all that. And I think he was teaching planning 
courses in the architecture program. And

33:37.360 --> 33:39.001
finally, let's see. There's something out of one 
of our brochures I copied. It says, courses in

33:41.864 --> 33:46.909
planning were offered as early as 1940. The 
graduate professional degree Master of Science

33:50.380 --> 33:53.785
Community Regional Planning was approved in 
1959. But I don't think they had any graduates for

33:56.208 --> 33:58.692
about five years. I think the first graduate was in 
64.

34:13.133 --> 34:17.299
Basically, it was just Hugo.

34:17.701 --> 34:19.363
But then he took on Peter Colvin. Now, Peter Colvin 
was a second graduate. He graduated in 65. In the

34:24.709 --> 34:26.991
early years, they were graduating one student a 
year. And Peter Colvin, after he left, went to the

34:29.574 --> 34:40.386
University of Kansas and taught, I think, two 
years in the architecture school there. And then-

34:41.727 --> 34:43.249
Is he British? He's from South Africa. South 
Africa. I believe his- Undergraduate school is

34:47.452 --> 34:51.296
Witwatersrand. It's one of the major 
universities in South Africa.

35:01.727 --> 35:02.868
I've forgotten exactly when. He may have come over 
to study at Texas. That's quite possible. He came

35:08.134 --> 35:12.919
as a foreign

35:08.134 --> 35:12.919
student. He took this position and he taught in 
Lawrence, Kansas for two years. And then Hugo

35:18.945 --> 35:27.855
apparently got authorization for another 
position and recruited Peter and got him to come

35:18.945 --> 35:27.855
back. And as part of this, the inducement made him 
associate professor with tenure. So he started on

35:36.811 --> 35:41.497
the faculty in that position, and he still has 
that. I don't think he's ever been promoted beyond

35:41.557 --> 35:43.720
that. Sounds like me. Is that how you associate 
professor? For 10 years. That's all I've ever had.

35:50.890 --> 35:53.112
Well, you've got to move, you see. I moved to 
another university. Otherwise, if I was still at

35:55.415 --> 35:58.680
Texas, I'd probably still be associate 
professor.

36:02.265 --> 36:04.928
I think it was just Hugo and Peter for several 
years. And then at some point, Hugo, I guess,

36:05.785 --> 36:18.899
stepped down, or maybe he retired, and Leon Cole 
became the chair, who had a PhD from Harvard. And he

36:20.240 --> 36:24.385
hired several of the people. I think he hired Terry 
Kahn, and I know he hired Jim Hartley and Sandy

36:24.405 --> 36:30.071
Rosenblum. And they came at the same time, and I've 
forgotten.

36:36.700 --> 36:47.752
This sort of roping, I would say maybe Terry Kahn 
came in 1972, and Hartley and Rosenblum came in 73,

36:36.700 --> 36:47.752
something like that. So Leon was able to expand the 
program quite substantially in a short time. Was

36:53.838 --> 36:54.799
he a planner? He got a PhD in planning from Harvard. 
He did? Yeah. And he must have been there about four

37:00.205 --> 37:05.070
years, something like that. I think maybe he grew 
up in Texas, you know, and eventually went off to

37:05.557 --> 37:12.788
the east to be educated and then came back.

37:15.633 --> 37:18.557
He always reminded me of sort of a power broker 
type. You know him? I met him. I'm not sure where. I

37:21.882 --> 37:22.924
might have met him once. I certainly wouldn't 
recognize him. I wouldn't either. Well, he left

37:27.511 --> 37:30.636
all of a sudden in the middle of the year. I think he 
didn't even wait until the end of the semester.

37:35.826 --> 37:37.428
What was the reason? I'm not sure it's clear. The 
things I heard from the faculty about him were he

37:40.974 --> 37:49.847
was kind of a wheeler-dealer, and they never 
really know what was going on or what he was doing.

37:49.887 --> 37:53.032
But apparently he was very energetic, and he got a 
lot of money and things. And it built up a number of

37:53.973 --> 37:55.876
students, I think, too. He took a position in the 
Library of Congress. I think as an economist. I

38:02.613 --> 38:09.582
think he might have had a degree in economics 
before he got his PhD in planning.

38:11.544 --> 38:12.786
And he may still be there. I really haven't heard 
about him for many years.

38:17.652 --> 38:23.900
I think Peter Koltman was acting director after he 
left. And I think they did a national search and

38:25.362 --> 38:29.327
they hired John Gowery. And

38:29.881 --> 38:43.557
then,

38:29.881 --> 38:43.557
let's see, when I came there, okay, in the fall of 
75, things were quite a bit of turmoil.

38:47.501 --> 38:50.024
There was a dean there that was having a lot of 
trouble. Now, he was from Philadelphia. His name

38:53.748 --> 38:55.230
was Charles Burnett. He might have bought a 
gallery. Maybe Burnett went there first and then

38:57.714 --> 39:05.609
he kind of selected a gallery to come. He'd known 
them in Philadelphia. I think they both were...

39:07.712 --> 39:12.601
Burnett had a PhD in architecture, I think. He was 
one of like 50 people in the country that had

39:12.621 --> 39:16.729
doctorates in architecture. From Penn? I believe 
that's right. Only a few schools give it. Berkeley

39:22.238 --> 39:24.161
gives it. We have a doctor from Berkeley. And

39:29.729 --> 39:41.046
this sort of came to a head right before Christmas 
in 1975. And somehow the architecture faculty

39:42.207 --> 39:49.935
gave a vote of no confidence to Burnett. And we 
really weren't in on this. The planning people are

39:53.419 --> 39:55.301
pretty isolated. But anyway, he just resigned all 
of a sudden, effective in two weeks or something

39:56.363 --> 40:01.368
like that. And then Gallery was made acting dean. 
He, I guess, had been given the title of associate

40:06.760 --> 40:10.666
dean before. I think he sort of helped with some of 
the administrative work. And also, he's not

40:14.872 --> 40:17.716
really trained in planning. He's really trained 
as an architect. He just sort of picked up planning

40:20.120 --> 40:28.853
through work experience and all through doing 
urban design projects.

40:29.795 --> 40:35.383
So John Gallery served as the acting dean for the 
spring of 76. And of course, he didn't spend much

40:40.146 --> 40:48.695
time on the planning program, and things were 
pretty chaotic.

40:48.715 --> 40:50.618
And John wanted to be the permanent dean.

40:53.701 --> 41:00.529
But there was apparently a substantial group on 
the architecture faculty that didn't want him.

41:02.451 --> 41:04.493
And eventually, they hired Hal Lox. They hired Hal 
Box away from UT Arlington. Yes, that's right. And

41:10.478 --> 41:17.725
I understand the reason that he was hired was 
because he was the oldest member of the faculty at

41:10.478 --> 41:17.725
UT Arlington. So he must have known something. 
Well, he had a very successful practice in Dallas,

41:21.909 --> 41:24.872
I believe. One of the larger firms in Dallas.

41:32.298 --> 41:35.121
I understand he understands very little about 
planning. Well, he's not an intellectual. He's a

41:38.479 --> 41:39.640
very good fundraiser.

41:42.342 --> 41:46.446
Most of these people, even in planning now, have 
titles on their names. They're endowed. I don't

41:48.708 --> 41:50.790
know how to get their catalog. I mean, Sandy 
Rosenblum is an endowed share. Some of them are

41:54.553 --> 42:00.418
endowed lecturers or endowed teaching fellow. 
Basically, I think there's a whole system of

42:00.438 --> 42:05.142
salary supplements. Apparently in that school, 
you know, over half of the faculty is some kind of

42:05.797 --> 42:10.784
endowment. It gives them extra money. That's 
nice. And I don't know what A&M, I mean, some of all

42:14.829 --> 42:19.956
that endowment money went to A&M too, I think. We 
don't have any endowed chairs. You don't have any?

42:25.002 --> 42:27.465
Or an architecture? An architecture,

42:27.485 --> 42:32.352
I don't think there are any endowed chairs either. 
There's only one endowed chair in the entire

42:32.372 --> 42:34.875
college. So

42:35.227 --> 42:40.072
let's see. Well, when Box came and Gowley realized 
he wasn't going to get the position, he kind of went

42:40.252 --> 42:55.787
out looking for another job and left and went to 
work in the city of Philadelphia for Frank Rizzo.

42:58.589 --> 43:04.575
And so then there was an interim when Terry Kahn was 
made the acting director. It may just have been one

43:06.040 --> 43:07.703
semester. It seems to me maybe Gallery left at the 
end of the fall semester.

43:15.274 --> 43:26.011
So I think that was probably

43:15.274 --> 43:26.011
the spring of 77 that Terry was acting director. 
And then we did a national search for a current

43:26.331 --> 43:33.162
director. I had some very good candidates, and I 
think about four or five people came to interview,

43:34.070 --> 43:41.269
and Ed McClure was selected then. I wonder if 
somebody should check, I guess. Where is Ed

43:46.061 --> 43:48.167
McClure from? Where was he from? I believe he's a 
native of Florida. I believe he grew up in Florida.

43:57.758 --> 44:00.383
And I think he was talking about visiting his 
father. And

44:01.685 --> 44:10.662
he had

44:01.685 --> 44:10.662
started two planning programs. He got his PhD at 
Harvard in planning. after many, many years. But

44:18.718 --> 44:23.922
he started the program at VPI, which they now call 
Virginia Tech. He was the first chair of that. And

44:27.105 --> 44:28.927
then he started the program at Florida State. At 
Calhoun State? Yeah. He was the originator of that

44:31.349 --> 44:32.811
program. Also, he's a very important person in the 
history of planning, really, of planning

44:33.972 --> 44:38.376
education. Can I repeat that? No, it's over. Okay, 
while Ed was in Texas, he was asked to run for

44:42.667 --> 44:51.761
president of the Association of Collegiate 
Schools of Planning. And he decided to and was

44:53.303 --> 45:01.195
elected and really changed that whole 
organization. He was most of the presidents and

45:01.796 --> 45:07.324
then kind of caretakers. that hadn't really 
pushed very much. But he had a definite platform,

45:10.658 --> 45:18.511
which he was able to get through. Two main things he 
wanted. He wanted to have separate conferences

45:20.174 --> 45:24.941
from the professionals. He thought they really 
got kind of pushed aside

45:25.001 --> 45:35.218
by the American Planning Association as a 
predecessor now. And the other thing is he wanted

45:35.485 --> 45:44.365
to have a journal, not just a newsletter, but a 
journal for planning education. And both of those

45:45.526 --> 45:51.131
things were accomplished while he was president 
and all, and both of them really have been quite

45:45.526 --> 45:51.131
successful. Oh, yeah, the journal is really a very 
high-quality publication. Well, some other

45:55.055 --> 46:01.480
people, you know, said, well, you know, we're just 
not going to have something that talks about how to

45:55.055 --> 46:01.480
teach. You know, research is important, too. 
Pierre Clavel was one of these. He, at one time, was

46:05.664 --> 46:08.046
very active. And he said, you know, it's going to be 
research as well as teaching. You know, that's the

46:11.850 --> 46:14.352
way it's turned out. And the conferences are quite 
successful too. I've never, for one reason or

46:19.837 --> 46:27.966
another, I haven't attended them, except I think 
one, but usually our department had those. Right.

46:33.773 --> 46:38.137
Okay, so I don't know, let's see, are there other 
people on the faculty? What about the program

46:38.338 --> 46:43.123
itself? What kind of curriculum does the program 
have or did it have? Has it gone through many

46:49.360 --> 46:52.524
changes through the year? There was one major 
change after McClure came.

46:58.932 --> 47:02.956
There may have been some earlier too, probably 
before I got there in 1975. But the first year

47:04.578 --> 47:07.542
McClure was there, we spent about
