WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:02.888
José María Garza. Yes. And where was he born? He 
didn't return to Vieja García. In what year? 1906.

00:10.697 --> 00:13.800
And when did he live in Ateas? In 1914. And for what 
reason? For the revolution. Ah, yes. And tell me

00:19.327 --> 00:22.610
more about the revolution in these days, please. 
Well, before that date when we came here, when we

00:24.633 --> 00:31.320
lived in Vieja García, My father was in charge 
there. And when the revolutionaries came in, they

00:35.324 --> 00:39.089
came with the... He was in charge there. And to give 
them reason where there was corn, food, whatever.

00:48.101 --> 00:52.807
And they went and looted

00:48.101 --> 00:52.807
everything. And at that time, at about two or three 
o'clock, those revolutionaries came out and the

00:52.827 --> 00:57.373
federals came in. They were from the government. 
After a while, they were thrown out of the

01:00.983 --> 01:07.991
billiards and the billiardsmen came in. After a 
while, a bandit from Tolentino came in with

01:08.011 --> 01:12.656
people. And that's when the federalists came in 
again, the trebadores from La Huerta. There was a

01:17.262 --> 01:20.686
day when the money changed every two hours. It was 
so cheap, it was worth a kind of money. It was in

01:23.869 --> 01:27.614
paper, billiards that they named it. Some bills in 
pesos, in cincos. In half an hour it was worth a

01:30.683 --> 01:36.390
coin, in half an hour another, and it was like that. 
And there were dead people hanging there. They

01:38.472 --> 01:42.037
were carried in carts. They were dodged like 
dodging firewood. And there, on the riverbank,

01:45.801 --> 01:50.747
they made a well for them, they called it the 
caracol. There they just lit the yunta and emptied

01:50.767 --> 01:53.951
them to the dead. There they were carried.

01:58.937 --> 02:00.319
And that's when he took... Francisco could not get 
out via Nicamole and Nacataz. There is a stream of

02:07.934 --> 02:23.833
the Cerro del Fraile that goes all the way here, all 
the way to Mediación, via Gacía, via Gacía's

02:07.934 --> 02:23.833
plains. And they used it as a fence, the billets. 
And from there, from Sierra Madre, another came.

02:29.425 --> 02:35.615
It was just a river, a stream, and they couldn't get 
out of sight. General Alfonso Vázquez came and

02:35.636 --> 02:42.768
started to bring people in. As he was in charge, 
they were gathering. They were from the

02:45.673 --> 02:50.100
government who were coming that day. They were 
there for three days, and when they had parking

02:50.587 --> 03:00.279
spaces in black boxes, that was the park, they 
would come in and accommodate him there. At three

03:00.339 --> 03:07.589
in the morning, they gave orders to throw 
Francisco Villa there. If he turned back, they

03:07.669 --> 03:09.051
would thrash him. It was a push for a decision. And 
they came in at about eight in the morning, and

03:14.217 --> 03:19.063
people started to come out. By ten, they started to 
get injured. They brought them home and brought

03:21.181 --> 03:24.165
them to Monterrey. At two in the afternoon, 
General Alfonso Vázquez was killed. He was shot

03:29.834 --> 03:30.535
three times. He didn't want to be brought back from 
combat. He wanted three captains. When he arrived

03:37.785 --> 03:39.668
in Monterrey, he died. But the people of General 
Alfonso Vázquez never came back until Francisco

03:40.489 --> 03:47.219
Villa was thrown out. In the port of... Why did you 
explain?

04:20.868 --> 04:45.070
He clarified, part of

04:20.868 --> 04:45.070
your question was, he clarified

04:20.868 --> 04:45.070
that there were

04:20.868 --> 04:45.070
different groups. My father had a lot of corn and 
everything. There was whatever they wanted. If

04:52.790 --> 04:59.362
you turned to the other side, they would kill you. 
You had to be with them if they wanted to be with us.

05:05.533 --> 05:08.158
Don't go against them. Don't oppose them. Because 
there were too many groups. Who were they going to

05:13.518 --> 05:16.402
favor? And so they really were neutral. Right. But 
they were the ones that were getting screwed, you

05:20.186 --> 05:23.270
know? Right, right. The machine guns. What kind of 
work did your father have before the revolution?

05:30.458 --> 05:33.041
He was a carpenter. He made bagpipes. Morales. 
Riatas del azar. carpets, and a lot of other things

05:39.421 --> 05:48.692
that are from Istria. What did you do with them? 
From Istria. What was that? Mamey. From Lechuvía.

05:55.079 --> 05:55.900
From Lechuvía. And he was the owner there? He was 
the owner. And what did those lands do? They left

06:00.746 --> 06:01.747
them there. They left them there. We also have 
lands there. If we don't pay taxes, we have

06:04.430 --> 06:07.073
nothing. And they came to Laredo, Texas. to work in 
the bakery. Our older brothers were bakers. Your

06:20.345 --> 06:21.766
older brothers? How did they learn that trade in 
Spanish? The trade. The trade. In the bakeries,

06:28.154 --> 06:33.340
dad would put them to work, to teach them. Aunque 
les pagaran poquito, pero que aprendieran. He's a

06:38.163 --> 06:39.786
baker by trade also. He's a jack of all trades. Ah, y 
así aprendió usted de panadero también. Y

06:47.117 --> 06:53.887
trabajamos en... Ahí en Laredo trabajaron de 
panaderos. En 1915. In 1915 we started working in

06:56.118 --> 07:02.344
the panadería El Gallo, in Larero. In Larero. In 
Larero. There we worked. His name was Raúl

07:04.846 --> 07:09.130
Ornelas, the owner of the bakery. And one of his 
sons was Luque Ornelas. We worked there. And at 17

07:15.496 --> 07:18.019
we came here to Camargo. And from Camargo we moved 
here to Rio Grande. To work in the bakery. And my

07:22.423 --> 07:24.505
brothers were teachers. He's got a brother that

07:25.210 --> 07:49.497
lives

07:25.210 --> 07:49.497
in Monterrey,

07:25.210 --> 07:49.497
Mexico. And you came here to the United States, 
from Camargo. Yes, from Camargo. They brought us

07:54.546 --> 07:55.348
here. After the Revolution. After the 
Revolution. Why did you come to Texas? Because

07:59.254 --> 08:03.200
from here we went to look for Leopoldo Reynaga, who 
was a baker. But you had a lot of knowledge here in

08:03.340 --> 08:06.666
Rio Grande, right? Yes, because of the question of 
being bakers. And they brought us here so that we

08:09.831 --> 08:14.218
could work there. And why did you stay here in 
Texas? Why did your brother Felipe return to

08:16.301 --> 08:18.184
Mexico? But he never lived in Texas. I was working 
here in Texas, but because he was a mechanic, any

08:21.108 --> 08:39.898
motor that he heard working, he worked in Peñoles, 
in a factory where he was in charge of just

08:21.108 --> 08:39.898
following the engine that was failing, he would 
tell them to drive it. But he came back, he

08:39.918 --> 08:43.804
preferred to go to Mexico to stay here. Yes, he did. 
Y nosotros, pues, aquí estábamos sacando bien la

08:46.666 --> 08:51.631
vida hasta la fecha. Ya no nos movimos. Trabajé el 
25. En 1924, trabajamos

08:56.075 --> 09:04.342
en San Antonio, en la panadería de Jacobo Estrada. 
Era una de las mejores panaderías que había. Y ahí

09:08.466 --> 09:10.568
trabajé en Houston. Bueno, usted nació en Villa 
García, ¿no? En Villa García.

09:18.458 --> 09:25.329
When was it that the U.S. took, they made the Rio 
Grande border, you know, the American border? Oh,

09:25.349 --> 09:25.709
1845. That was in 1845. That was way after the 
revolution. So that means that these people, when

09:29.435 --> 09:34.923
they crossed that border, they were actually 
crossing into a foreign country. They were

09:34.943 --> 09:36.546
crossing into a foreign country. So, ¿cómo se 
quedaban aquí legalmente? Why would the U.S.

09:38.609 --> 09:40.372
government let them do that? I don't know. How did 
they cross the border without the American

09:43.248 --> 09:48.295
government telling them? We crossed in Laredo and 
they just pointed us out. That's the date. They

09:53.902 --> 09:55.224
were just right on us. They were just right on us. 
That's the date. And then when we came here, we came

09:57.327 --> 10:01.152
here, they charged us with passports. And when 
they arrived, they charged us with passports. We

10:04.276 --> 10:05.978
went through the bridge with permission. They 
took our passports. And then when the $8 passports

10:07.300 --> 10:11.145
arrived, we took them out. Everyone took out their 
passports. The first time they crossed? You, when

10:16.207 --> 10:16.808
you crossed? There wasn't. There wasn't? There 
wasn't a passport. You crossed in 1903? Yes. And

10:22.276 --> 10:23.418
there wasn't a passport? There wasn't 
immigration? Yes, the reason why we were

10:25.741 --> 10:28.706
registered. Ah, they would just record. Ah, they 
just wrote the names of the people. They didn't

10:33.172 --> 10:34.695
write anything. And they were registered there. 
Did it stay there? There was no limit to how long

10:40.086 --> 10:42.950
they could stay here. There was no limit. The years 
went by. When did the American government require

10:47.735 --> 10:56.786
the registration? Around 1918. So what did they 
do? When the American government demanded

11:03.542 --> 11:07.867
that... The passports were $10. They

11:09.909 --> 11:22.803
could have stayed here in the United States for as 
long as they wanted.

11:25.425 --> 11:29.850
Right, that's what... In fact, there weren't even 
closed checks a lot of places. A lot of places you

11:33.774 --> 11:37.480
just walked across and nobody even asked you to 
sign your name. Like I say, the people that lived

11:37.500 --> 11:41.406
here, the people that lived there were the same 
people. Right, right. And the border was

11:42.929 --> 11:44.952
absolutely big. In fact, it was up in the 20s that 
the first real... close checks began to be made,

11:51.008 --> 12:02.961
and it wasn't until about 1930 or in the early 30s 
that there was any officially enforced

11:51.008 --> 12:02.961
close-ups. That's when she found out that she was 
an American citizen, when they started enforcing

12:03.761 --> 12:08.867
it. In the 1930s. Right. She was going to go get her 
official citizenship, and she said, you're

12:10.569 --> 12:19.598
already a citizen. What year were you married? The 
first time. In 1924. A woman from here or from

12:27.039 --> 12:31.745
Mexico? From here. From the United States? From 
the United States. What was her name? Maria

12:42.939 --> 12:43.680
Aguirre. And she was from Texas? She was from 
Texas. She was from Texas? Yes. And here in Rio

12:53.479 --> 12:54.881
Grande. How did her family come here to Rio Grande? 
We lived here. We lived here. I don't know. They

12:59.988 --> 13:03.893
probably emigrated in the same conditions. My 
husband lived over there

13:03.913 --> 13:10.301
in Rivera. He lived over there in Rivera. It was 
Rivera. Well, sir, tell

13:15.046 --> 13:34.076
me a little more about life here in the United 
States. Could it be that you were kidnapped again?

13:40.987 --> 13:41.087
What? Well, tell me a little more about your life 
here in the United States. Well, here in the United

13:45.329 --> 13:51.418
States I've had a good time. I've always worked. 
Yes. And we, as we had a bakery office, they came to

13:53.361 --> 13:58.468
take us from various places. Once, they took me to 
El Cauce, to San Juan, to Quinisville, to... San

14:09.417 --> 14:16.344
Antonio also took me to Dílete, or Mílete, how is 
San Antonio? Dílete, yes, or Mílete, it's over

14:16.364 --> 14:18.607
there. Two little places, there's Cotula too. 
There have always been better jobs than on the

14:24.473 --> 14:29.278
other side. We knew how to work in the bakery, and we 
still had the fame of bakers, because we were

14:29.598 --> 14:38.968
bakers, and we still are.

14:40.822 --> 14:44.506
¿Y de ahí se divorció usted y de ahí se volvió a 
casar?

14:47.449 --> 14:47.609
Sí. My wife is his daughter from the second wife. ¿Y 
cuánto se casaba la segunda vez? Cuarenta y cinco.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.462
¿Cuarenta y cinco? Sí. ¿Y en qué pueblo? Aquí en Río 
Grande. ¿En Río Grande? En Río Grande. ¿Para

15:05.989 --> 15:08.331
cuántos años vivía usted en Río Grande? That's 73 
and 63. In 56 years. But he was talking

15:13.175 --> 15:32.412
about living

15:13.175 --> 15:32.412
all these

15:13.175 --> 15:32.412
other different places. He's very old. Wow. He 
wasn't gone for long, you know, just two or three

15:36.047 --> 15:44.695
months. This

15:44.735 --> 15:54.505
is from a temple

15:44.735 --> 15:54.505
rock. A temple rock in the

15:54.605 --> 16:01.572
pot. Ah, yes, I understand. You understand? Yes. 
It took me a month to work. To work. Yes, to work. And

16:10.667 --> 16:14.290
all the time, the work class is in the bakery? In the 
bakery and... In the court. Carpentry and... In

16:17.954 --> 16:18.435
the court. In the what? In the court. Court? What 
does the court give you? Work. Work in the county.

16:27.284 --> 16:30.647
The same, carpentry, cleaning, and... Several 
jobs, a little bit. I know a little bit of

16:33.616 --> 16:35.959
everything. I'm also a plumber.

16:40.443 --> 16:42.625
Because I've liked learning a little bit of 
everything. Yes. But my profession is a baker. A

16:46.870 --> 16:47.590
baker, yes. Because I worked in Hebron. In 1932, I 
worked in the bakery. Were you married to my uncle?

16:58.601 --> 16:58.661
No. He didn't get married until 1945.

17:02.740 --> 17:09.151
And for what reason did you never come back to 
Mexico? Well, I had a good time here. My parents

17:12.577 --> 17:17.145
were close by in Camargo. So... Working here is 
good. But I liked it better here. So you come here

17:21.513 --> 17:24.939
and live well. My husband died at the age of 79. He 
didn't go to jail. That's

17:29.420 --> 17:58.768
what I,

17:29.420 --> 17:58.768
you know, I work in the hospital.

17:59.035 --> 18:04.303
We're very interested in health and longevity. 
And I'd like to explain to my son how that has been to

18:04.944 --> 18:09.571
live so many years. His whole family has lived 
extremely well. And we have both sides of our

18:13.216 --> 18:15.980
families. And I can't understand how come we don't 
make it.

18:24.653 --> 18:28.198
You know, natural selection. the infant 
mortality was probably very high. Although it

18:34.080 --> 18:36.022
varied with families even then. And you, in the 
families that you had, since you all had big

18:36.623 --> 18:46.797
families, what was the percentage of children 
that died in childhood? Of our families? Well, we

18:48.159 --> 18:50.902
were 17 families. The family that I was in was 17. 
It's just like, I used to

18:54.638 --> 19:18.004
live in El Paso and the tribe, the Indian tribe, the 
natives that live there are the Tarahumara. And

19:18.645 --> 19:21.388
I've read some articles that have been written on 
them. Sanitation

19:21.976 --> 19:27.844
is very poor. The infant mortality is extremely 
high, but the people that survive, they all live to

19:27.864 --> 19:35.514
be 100 years old. So that's why I say it's natural 
selection, survival of the fittest. Well,

19:42.007 --> 19:59.982
there's always been a fallacy about the 
increasing lifespan, because even in very

19:42.007 --> 19:59.982
primitive societies, anybody who survived 
infancy and then you bring in children, men have no

19:42.007 --> 19:59.982
warfare, which is fairly typical of most. And 
there does seem

20:00.181 --> 20:10.314
to be a very strong genetic component. My father 
was 79. The only reason he died young at 79 is that he

20:11.295 --> 20:16.201
drank a lot. That's true. You drink yourself to 
death at 79. His sister died. When did my aunt

20:22.328 --> 20:26.053
Felipa die? My aunt Felipa died last year. She was 
100 years old. for his older sister.

20:38.631 --> 20:44.600
But they were very active physically.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.501
They had to. They had to be active physically or 
they would starve to death.

20:51.987 --> 20:55.692
We're not, that's one of our biggest problems. 
We're not very active. I am, but I mean, the most

20:57.835 --> 21:03.063
people

20:57.835 --> 21:03.063
aren't. Are you drinking water

21:03.123 --> 21:13.518
from

21:03.123 --> 21:13.518
there? Yes. There we can see Cerrito's grave. So 
they

21:16.810 --> 21:40.759
would take the young men, they would just draft 
them, literally draft them into the...

21:41.060 --> 21:49.787
It sounded like in those days in the church, when 
they put stones on a brick and turned it over. They

21:50.155 --> 21:58.207
were very, definitely very hard done. I guess I 
would have done this. You know, I would say, I

22:08.501 --> 22:18.215
always used to, I used to tell my other 
grandfather, I said, you should just stay there

22:08.501 --> 22:18.215
and fight. They had nothing to fight for. 
Yesterday, in Cerritos, a lot of dead stones were

22:20.058 --> 22:27.790
seen. There were revolutionaries

22:27.810 --> 22:39.990
who caught a boss, tied him up in a post or in mules. 
The Soltán, who left. All of them were the same,

22:43.357 --> 22:47.083
right? The Caracistes, the Cerarabas, were the 
same? All of them were revolving. At that time,

22:51.530 --> 22:54.234
they fought each other. There were many bandits, 
many people who stood up with people. Like

22:58.941 --> 23:04.270
Sorrentino, a bandit who stood up. And others who 
stood up with others. Even if they were the same,

23:06.987 --> 23:13.154
they would enter the town and say, let's be 
villagers. And they would come back and be the same

23:13.174 --> 23:16.337
as they were. There was a problem in Vietnam. You 
couldn't tell who the enemy was. They all looked

23:19.881 --> 23:20.702
alike. They killed cows and gave them to the people 
and ate them. Hey,

23:27.209 --> 23:32.134
Ella, come here. This is like one of my older 
sisters. How do you do? Really? You've been

23:44.372 --> 23:46.915
studying? Excuse me, let me go in. Oh, were

23:51.259 --> 24:03.150
you sitting over here?

24:03.265 --> 24:05.809
Oh, I'm tired. Let me switch this off.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.703
You know, we have kids who come from Mexico. And 
boy, you know that they have it much better off

24:15.745 --> 24:20.052
here. They come out here without nothing. And in 
fact, there's two families right here. I bet you

24:26.362 --> 24:28.986
one of them hasn't been here one year. They've 
already built their own home, something they've

24:29.438 --> 24:34.743
never had before. And her brother-in-law is... 
Well, they've been here just about 60 months. They

24:41.570 --> 24:43.132
haven't yet. But they sure do. It's going to get 
much easier here. What do you think?

24:59.493 --> 25:08.745
It's a more advanced

24:59.493 --> 25:08.745
system. But now there's a lot of opportunity in 
Mexico,

25:09.405 --> 25:24.184
right? What do you think about the revolution now? 
Will it be good or bad for Mexico? Well, right now I

25:31.984 --> 25:36.928
don't know if it will be good or bad. I feel like I'm 
permanent. I'm asking, if there had never been

25:40.251 --> 25:47.457
that revolution, in what state would Mexico be 
right now? It would be very good. Better or worse?

25:50.600 --> 25:50.780
Better. Better than how it is now? Better than how 
it is now. Is it because of the revolution? In life,

25:55.771 --> 26:04.180
which is better in Mexico now, do you think it's 
because of the revolution or not? Well, in those

26:05.001 --> 26:09.846
times it was because of the revolution and the bad 
administration of the government.

26:13.430 --> 26:13.550
Yes. Well, the revolution was necessary. Well, it 
would be, it wouldn't be, but the revolution was

26:15.232 --> 26:23.280
made out of envy of the presidency.

26:25.437 --> 26:40.980
They used to have revolution

26:25.437 --> 26:40.980
after

26:25.437 --> 26:40.980
revolution. They had a hundred in a row. The word 
revolution used to be synonymous with the word

26:46.007 --> 26:49.352
Mexico. They all wanted to be president and the 
only way they could become president was to have a

26:50.480 --> 27:17.230
revolution and throw off the other government.

27:18.172 --> 27:47.082
He said the

27:18.172 --> 27:47.082
important thing is that she came

27:18.172 --> 27:47.082
over here because

27:18.172 --> 27:47.082
of that. . No, but

27:47.770 --> 27:55.118
not even your mom was happy here. Not even your mom, 
right? And the older families weren't happy here.

27:59.283 --> 28:02.967
They didn't talk about coming back either. Yes. 
Why? What was it that they were interested in? Hey

28:07.151 --> 28:12.317
ma'am, and when you got here to Rio Grande, where 
did you sit? Did you rent a house or what? Temporary

28:14.618 --> 28:22.070
lodging.

28:22.130 --> 28:31.865
Temporary

28:22.130 --> 28:31.865
lodging until they got on their feet. This was set 
up by the American government during the

28:31.905 --> 28:38.515
revolution. That's why they were in the army post. 
Well, Freddy,

28:42.985 --> 29:01.358
but they do the same thing now with the people 
coming from Mexico. Yes, the Cuban. All right,

29:02.740 --> 29:03.782
take the Cuban. And they, too, have the dream of 
going back to Cuba. That's their dream. But look,

29:11.553 --> 29:21.484
the people that are coming from Mexico, like these 
people that come, they come here on Saturday,

29:11.553 --> 29:21.484
Monday, they're on free lunch, on welfare aid, and 
see, they get all their benefits. Now, they don't

29:21.685 --> 29:23.046
provide homes now. In fact, now they're asking 
them that they must have a home. Before they can

29:26.950 --> 29:28.912
come home. But why does the U.S. government do 
that? It doesn't make any sense. I think it's

29:33.117 --> 29:35.740
humanity wanting to to help other humans. I think 
they look at them as just humans, not as Mexicans.

29:40.959 --> 29:44.323
Well, why do they do it for Cuba? The Cubans. This is 
a good government. This is a good government that

29:47.026 --> 29:53.234
helps its soldiers who come from Spain. But 
wouldn't Mexico do the same thing? I don't think

29:56.157 --> 29:58.400
so. I wouldn't say there's a better retired 
Mexican. No, but to help an American who was

30:05.673 --> 30:14.852
already expatriated for some reason, looking for 
a better life, don't you think you would want to

30:05.673 --> 30:14.852
help him? Yes, he admits it all the time. But to help 
him with food and coffee. Not to help the same

30:19.562 --> 30:21.927
people. If you look at the Mexican government when 
it comes to a politician, for example, a man who

30:23.257 --> 30:35.381
goes through politics, through war, they receive 
him. The government receives him and gives him

30:35.862 --> 30:39.409
protection. But a bandolero, just to go, because I 
liked to wear a bandolero, no. Not anywhere, not

30:45.539 --> 30:46.821
here. No, it's what I said. But correctly, yes. Any 
government of any kind, I know they have given them

30:49.465 --> 30:56.195
protection and they give it wherever they want. 
The same here as there. Because here I was once, if a

30:57.597 --> 31:03.186
revolutionary came from there for the war, there 
they were in the house of... We worked in the bakery

31:03.166 --> 31:08.154
and we would bring them food at night. They would 
come running from there. And then the

31:10.918 --> 31:16.066
administration came and protected them. But 
don't you think, Chema, that if you come back with

31:16.086 --> 31:29.207
your family... Don't you think that you could... 
You have workers. You're going to have... I have

31:30.546 --> 31:31.987
good people wherever they want to protect me. No, 
no. But it could be a life almost the same as the one

31:32.187 --> 31:34.549
here, when you start working with your children. 
Yes. Why not? I say yes. I also say yes. The worker

31:35.550 --> 31:37.032
wherever he wants to live, he does well. But you're 
saying that... The worker wherever he wants to

31:37.732 --> 31:39.474
live, he does well. The worker wherever he wants to 
live, he does well. The worker wherever he wants to

31:40.695 --> 31:41.876
live, he does well. The worker wherever he wants to 
live, he does well. The worker wherever he wants to

31:43.297 --> 31:44.418
live, he does well. The worker wherever he wants to 
live, he does well. The worker wherever he wants to

31:46.740 --> 31:47.761
live, he does well. The worker wherever he wants to 
live, he does well. The worker wherever he wants to

31:48.922 --> 31:50.103
live, he does well.

31:53.746 --> 31:54.807
The worker wherever he wants to live, he does well. 
The worker wherever he wants to live, he does well.

31:56.629 --> 31:57.770
The worker wherever he wants to live, he does well. 
The worker wherever he wants We see the jumps.

32:17.821 --> 32:21.487
But there may be nothing wrong with that way of 
life. Well, maybe not, but that's why you get more

32:21.507 --> 32:24.412
money. Most of the Mexican cities now, I would say, 
there's a very strong sense of what the sonchises

32:25.254 --> 32:30.623
are doing. Well, yes, because they have learned it 
from here. Now, we traveled into Mexico last

32:40.180 --> 32:43.305
summer. And we were in Guanajuato, and there was a 
little boy there, I would say, between five and

32:43.285 --> 32:49.392
seven. That kid was smart, but you could tell that 
he was among the poorest there. You know, and I told

32:54.578 --> 33:08.295
my children, we had a guide with us, and I told my 
children, you know, it's a shame that such a bright

32:54.578 --> 33:08.295
child may never have the opportunity to become 
president here in Mexico, while in the United

32:54.578 --> 33:08.295
States he might have. And the guide said, oh, yes, 
they do. He said, oh, yes, we have some poor now come

33:10.707 --> 33:14.232
up. They have to get up and go. And I said, well, I 
don't think that has been the picture of Mexico.

33:18.859 --> 33:21.042
Because the haves have always been the haves. And 
the have-nots are the have-nots. And a have will

33:22.905 --> 33:25.989
not let a have-not go up the ladder. And he said, 
well, that picture is changing very rapidly. And

33:29.434 --> 33:31.517
then he told us his own life story. What was his last 
story? Well, that he had been a had-not. He said, I

33:36.063 --> 33:41.269
came down from the mountains, and I had enough 
intelligence to want to do something for myself. I

33:41.309 --> 33:42.631
left my family back there. I came over here, this 
family, this family, evidently with more money.

33:48.818 --> 33:51.902
It took me in when they found out that I had it up 
here. He said, and they have given me this life. And

33:54.858 --> 34:00.984
he was, of course, going to college, and he was 
studying either to be a doctor or something big.

34:01.784 --> 34:02.605
And I said, really? You know, I asked the question. 
I said, really? He said, oh, yeah, there's a lot of

34:05.107 --> 34:07.389
cases like this. And he showed us. He said, they 
come down from those mountains, and there will be

34:08.550 --> 34:14.996
people here that will be willing to help. They

34:16.878 --> 34:22.463
don't seem to think so. Or he didn't seem to think 
so. We have slums in this country. But they don't

34:27.674 --> 34:30.758
compare to the slums they have down there. They are 
slums, you know, they are slums. Ooh, like that's

34:32.920 --> 34:36.925
the Barrio Independencia from Monterey, which is 
not so far. It's worse in Monterey than it is in

34:37.485 --> 34:41.950
Guadalupe. I think it's because Monterey has been 
attracting such a large number of people who are

34:42.171 --> 34:51.281
unskilled from the country side. And they linger 
around the edges of Monterey. There's no way to

34:57.188 --> 35:01.635
absorb it. So you see, yes, I'd say that the value of 
incandescent in Monterey is probably wonderful,

35:01.695 --> 35:16.598
but I've never been.

37:21.790 --> 37:30.038
I'm Ella Montemayor, and I am Mrs. Medina's 
daughter. I have been asked what made us get out of

37:30.058 --> 37:35.944
being the migrant family that we used to be. My 
mother and father had a large family. He was a

37:41.429 --> 37:43.451
migrant worker. But I have always said that it was 
this foresight that my mother had that we had to get

37:49.499 --> 37:52.103
out of this way of living. And so she, they had a high 
emphasis on education. And she would stay home

37:57.490 --> 38:03.658
with the children, and my dad would go, and she 
would just try to make live with whatever he sent.

38:04.660 --> 38:08.205
And well, we're not, not any of us are really 
wealthy. But we all, at least, we're all stay in

38:09.086 --> 38:17.177
school, and our children have an opportunity to 
stay in school. I don't know. And why do you feel

38:21.068 --> 38:25.092
your mother had this drive? I don't know. I think it 
was in her. I mean, some people have it. That's the

38:29.457 --> 38:31.780
only way I can see it. Some people have it, and some 
people... It's an inner drive. I don't know. I

38:36.466 --> 38:36.786
don't know. We always tell her that we think that we 
all inherited from her. But... Because I see it in

38:40.650 --> 38:44.575
school children. There are some parents that just 
don't have it. No matter how much we try to tell

38:47.318 --> 38:49.020
them. They feel that the way they're living is 
perfect. And you're now a schoolteacher. Yes. In

38:55.279 --> 39:00.126
fact, there's at least eight or ten within the 
family. I'm a schoolteacher. My husband's a

39:01.488 --> 39:03.311
schoolteacher. My brother's a schoolteacher. My 
sister-in-law's a schoolteacher. My sister. I

39:07.096 --> 39:08.338
have two, a brother and a sister. They're 
schoolteachers in MacAllen. We've all, well

39:12.203 --> 39:17.431
practically all of us, of course now like mother 
says, her ambition was to have doctors and

39:12.203 --> 39:17.431
lawyers. But when you're climbing up, you just 
can't skip. The next thing for us was education.

39:26.085 --> 39:27.908
And so we all got into an education field. Now I tell 
my children, now of course they can have an

39:34.377 --> 39:38.884
ambition to become a doctor or a lawyer, because 
now they have had better opportunities than what I

39:34.377 --> 39:38.884
had. I came from a home where no English was spoken. 
So mother could not help us. And they have had a much

39:45.073 --> 39:47.316
better opportunity. We do a lot of traveling. 
They've been exposed to a lot more than what we

39:49.319 --> 39:53.425
could have done. We had to do it practically on our 
own. Of course, it was her drive. I think because, I

39:58.693 --> 40:02.258
don't know, and daddy was very willing to go along 
with her idea. How much of the year was he usually

40:05.811 --> 40:07.754
gone? Oh, I would say not more than six months. 
Because he didn't know how to write. And so the

40:16.325 --> 40:20.271
communication was very little. And so he had to 
come and see his family pretty often. Or else, you

40:24.737 --> 40:28.282
know, a whole year would go by and he really 
wouldn't know. So he tried to make it. I wouldn't

40:29.884 --> 40:31.907
say that he'd be gone more than six months. Three to 
six months. And your mother never would go and take

40:34.597 --> 40:37.040
you? Never. She probably went. Well, in fact, I 
think she went until the older ones were ready to

40:39.582 --> 40:45.349
start school. She followed him. My oldest sister, 
my grandmother, took her in so she wouldn't miss.

40:50.474 --> 40:56.500
And then as soon as my oldest brother was old enough 
to go to school, then she stayed. And from then on,

40:56.520 --> 40:58.222
it was a family stay. Father went. But we were 
never, the family was never, now I could say I went

41:01.722 --> 41:08.214
one year, but that was because I wanted to go. I 
wanted to see what it was like. And I went my junior

41:10.919 --> 41:15.387
year in high school. That's when I went to try it. We 
went during the summer. What was it like? Oh, I came

41:19.735 --> 41:22.701
back and I thought, mother, never. This is one 
thing I'll never do. I just stay home and go to

41:25.972 --> 41:27.674
school. And I think she emphasized that a lot when 
we were going to school. And we came from a family

41:33.001 --> 41:39.049
where most of us had perfect attendance because 
she emphasized it a lot. If you don't go to school,

41:39.149 --> 41:42.414
you're going to end up going with your daddy to the 
fields. And we all knew that that was rough out

41:43.355 --> 41:46.539
there in the sun. And some families now do not see it 
like that. To them, it's a joy to go, to leave school

41:50.805 --> 41:53.248
and go. I don't know why. I think it's because we're 
pushing. No, and I still tell them, I pass by a

41:59.220 --> 42:06.791
field, and I'm like, oh, God, I'm glad we got out of 
there. And I tell my kids, that's one of the

42:06.811 --> 42:12.359
roughest things to do. You cannot see how anybody, 
not even for all the money in the world, doesn't

42:12.379 --> 42:20.732
want to go and work on the fields. And, you know, the 
living conditions. I just can't see it.
