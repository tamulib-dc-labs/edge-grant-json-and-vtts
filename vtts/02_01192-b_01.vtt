WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:27.945
We sat there and Don Spirison, who is now my 
partner, who was running cardiovascular systems

00:02.326 --> 00:27.945
at Amnion at that time, we had to face up to the fact 
that going forward, our product, we had a low

00:02.326 --> 00:27.945
technology product, and our competitors, we felt 
that there would be a technology evolution in that

00:02.326 --> 00:27.945
market. that it would eventually go, say, from 
centrifugation to separate the blood to maybe

00:28.448 --> 00:34.976
some membrane technology. We didn't feel that our 
company had the resident R&D capability to

00:36.258 --> 00:45.129
advance that product to the next generation. So it 
was looking at that, looking at our inability to

00:45.269 --> 00:56.363
finance an acquisition after really actually 
having a hard time even finding something worth

00:45.269 --> 00:56.363
buying, We felt pretty much that maybe we should 
take the bird in the hand instead of the two in the

00:56.798 --> 01:05.090
bush. In retrospect, it was still probably the 
right decision to make. Is that a typical pattern,

01:10.257 --> 01:18.229
not the pattern of that particular company, but 
the pattern of venture capital?

01:20.853 --> 01:25.219
What I guess I'd like to know a little bit, I find 
this really fascinating, one of the things I'd

01:20.853 --> 01:25.219
like to know, I guess, is how the company itself 
evaluates what it's going to do, on what basis it

01:25.688 --> 01:33.076
makes its decisions. Because my preconceived 
notion was that venture capital was sort of an

01:34.718 --> 01:38.422
upfront thing. Once it gets its money, it's out of 
it. It's not really interested in managing

01:40.965 --> 01:43.528
companies. If we have to manage companies, we know 
we're in trouble, because we know the management

01:43.708 --> 01:50.375
that we selected is incapable. We don't want to 
manage companies on a day-to-day basis. It is the

01:55.051 --> 02:05.585
board, when you're talking about buying or 
selling or doing something major, that is a board

01:55.051 --> 02:05.585
decision, just as it's a board decision at IBM or 
Mitchell Energy. And the venture capitalists

02:06.346 --> 02:12.434
usually have fairly good representation on the 
board of directors. So we are involved in that

02:12.454 --> 02:14.636
decision. Our particular venture organization 
here has been more of an active manager than most

02:14.777 --> 02:22.847
venture organizations because We have been the 
founders of many of these companies. And number

02:27.276 --> 02:36.407
one and number two, the personalities of the three 
of us partners now are more, we're more active than

02:27.276 --> 02:36.407
passive. We don't manage where we don't want to be 
managed. But when it comes to things like in that

02:39.750 --> 02:52.024
particular case, even though Don is now my partner 
in Venture Capitalist, I was very active in

02:39.750 --> 02:52.024
identifying with Abbott Laboratories through 
contacts, the product line that we were looking to

02:52.628 --> 02:57.795
acquire. I had some contacts that provided us the 
banking contacts that we looked at trying to

02:59.618 --> 03:06.168
finance it. And it was, in fact, our relationship 
with the first Boston corporation who acted as

03:06.909 --> 03:15.000
investment bankers to Cove Laboratories. They 
actually called us about our interest in whether

03:15.020 --> 03:21.049
the company would be interested in selling. So 
venture capitalists don't want to be involved

03:21.434 --> 03:27.242
long-term in companies. They don't want to be 
involved in day-to-day management. But in the

03:29.605 --> 03:42.001
short term, in all things that are of strategic 
value or matters of liquidity to their

03:29.605 --> 03:42.001
investment, they'll take an active involvement 
in it. How does the staff research, I assume the

03:42.702 --> 03:50.212
staff research is done, to buttress these sorts of 
decisions? How is that developed? And within the

03:51.286 --> 03:53.508
venture capital company? Well, the three of us, we 
virtually live and breathe in the health care

03:53.528 --> 04:01.736
industry. We've had people, for example, my 
partner's father had a heart condition about a

04:02.797 --> 04:13.867
year ago. He's out in California. And he's in the 
hospital. Michael went out there. And Michael,

04:18.492 --> 04:20.854
for two years, Michael within our group had been 
our person who was looking at investments in

04:21.239 --> 04:27.045
interventional cardiology. He is more 
knowledgeable about every type of catheter,

04:27.846 --> 04:40.059
laser, roto-ablater to fight plaque and arteries 
than probably many physicians. And he's, because

04:40.720 --> 04:49.689
we're constantly looking for new technologies 
and products, he's probably more aware of new

04:40.720 --> 04:49.689
products than many physicians. And in that 
particular case, He recommended to the

04:51.631 --> 05:07.787
cardiologist in Southern California that they 
should talk to John Simpson up in San Francisco,

04:51.631 --> 05:07.787
who has had just gotten approval with the FDA to do, 
I think, an atherectomy procedure with one of his

04:51.631 --> 05:07.787
rotoablation devices. And so we're pretty 
knowledgeable about what's going on in the

05:07.847 --> 05:12.031
marketplace. And we're pretty knowledgeable 
about values of companies. And we feel that we're

05:21.449 --> 05:37.548
we think we're pretty qualified to make decisions 
when you want, you know, to make an acquisition,

05:21.449 --> 05:37.548
when you want to grow the company more, when you 
don't think you can grow it as much as it's, you

05:21.449 --> 05:37.548
know, to the rate of growth that you might be able to 
realize now if you sold it. So we take, in some

05:38.069 --> 05:49.503
cases, maybe even more so than management, who are 
focused on their single company and less aware of

05:38.069 --> 05:49.503
what all the other companies and what the 
competitors. Yeah, we're real

05:49.563 --> 05:50.884
industry-oriented. We go to And we go to health 
care meetings and medical conferences

05:51.689 --> 05:58.297
constantly to keep attuned to what's going on in 
the marketplace. And so what you're saying, by way

05:58.417 --> 06:08.750
of sort of summary, is that without that 
expertise, this company in any way wouldn't

05:58.417 --> 06:08.750
really be able to function the way it does. I think 
so. I think the difference between if you say what

06:09.370 --> 06:18.962
makes someone a venture capital investor versus 
not being a venture capital investor in the You

06:19.229 --> 06:29.482
know, the industry adages that we're active 
versus passive, or we add value as opposed to, you

06:19.229 --> 06:29.482
know, just being a passive investor. And how do you 
add value? You add value by being involved in the

06:31.144 --> 06:43.120
broader industry, by being able to make 
decisions, bring contacts to the company that any

06:31.144 --> 06:43.120
individual company or its management group might 
not have itself. Access technology. We are

06:46.145 --> 06:49.831
constantly getting proposals. We have contacts 
at universities all across the United States. If

06:54.759 --> 07:05.036
we're trying to build one of our own companies, we 
have a company right now that's an animal

06:54.759 --> 07:05.036
veterinary pharmaceutical company. And it has a 
great product, one of the most elegant, one of the

07:05.717 --> 07:13.249
most desirable products that will ever be on the 
market, I believe. Nonetheless, it's just one

07:13.583 --> 07:43.000
product, and if they want to build around that 
product, they either have to do it themselves,

07:13.583 --> 07:43.000
which, you know, what's the capability of one or 
two scientists to add more products when there

07:13.583 --> 07:43.000
are, you know, thousands every year trying to 
develop new ones of which only a few succeed,

07:13.583 --> 07:43.000
versus us who are constantly seeing deals and 
proposals and know that so-and-so is working on

07:13.583 --> 07:43.000
such-and-such at such-and-such university, and 
we can help those companies either access other

07:43.199 --> 07:51.390
technologies or know when not to develop one 
themselves because someone else is doing it. So

07:51.410 --> 08:06.591
were we to put this in the context of, say, a 
military operation, you feed into the strategic

07:51.410 --> 08:06.591
principles by providing key and timely 
intelligence of where the world is going and what

08:06.858 --> 08:08.101
what's going to be striking. If I could remember 
that exact statement, I would use it because that

08:08.121 --> 08:16.398
is, in essence, what we try to do. And sometimes 
we're capable of doing it, sometimes we're not.

08:20.426 --> 08:22.310
But that, in fact, is what we're trying to do. Okay. 
I'll do it. About the same time that we had launched

08:24.762 --> 08:53.149
cardiovascular systems independently and were 
starting to work with the University of Texas for

08:24.762 --> 08:53.149
the creation of LifeCell, as Dominic might have 
mentioned, Dominic had been at Baylor, and he had

08:24.762 --> 08:53.149
been interested in creating a new company.

08:54.665 --> 08:59.311
Mitchell had been talking to Baylor for years 
about having a presence out in the woodland.

08:59.351 --> 09:10.004
Dominic had been courted by people in Vancouver, 
Canada, and I think Temple University in

08:59.351 --> 09:10.004
Philadelphia had courted him. Arnold Beckman had 
courted him to move out to Irvine, California. And

09:14.870 --> 09:20.858
some people had talked about creating an 
institute of this or professorship of that. And

09:21.192 --> 09:47.470
the bottom line out of all that was that, and I think 
an important element of this process was that

09:21.192 --> 09:47.470
Baylor agreed in many ways to support Dominic and 
to support George Mitchell's vision to create the

09:21.192 --> 09:47.470
Center for Biotechnology out here in the 
Woodlands, which I do believe has helped them

09:21.192 --> 09:47.470
attract scientists that they might not have 
otherwise attracted. A good example is

09:50.816 --> 10:04.090
Bill Benedict, who came from the Doheny Eye 
Institute at the University of Southern

09:50.816 --> 10:04.090
California, a world-class scientist. He has just 
flat-out told me that he would never have come to

10:05.831 --> 10:16.242
Baylor and come to Texas if it hadn't been for 
Baylor's Center for Biotechnology in the

10:05.831 --> 10:16.242
woodlands. And did you have any participation in 
the development of that center? No, that was

10:21.405 --> 10:34.642
really done through Mitchell and the Woodlands 
Corporation, but it tied in a lot to Houston

10:21.405 --> 10:34.642
Biotechnology, which was Dominic's company, 
which we became the lead venture capital behind in

10:21.405 --> 10:34.642
1985-86. We brought in someone, acted as interim 
president for that company, and they've raised a

10:37.185 --> 10:45.756
lot of money. And now they, along with Argus 
Pharmaceuticals, are really the first two

10:46.040 --> 11:10.090
private biotechnology companies in Texas who 
have filed investigational new drug

10:46.040 --> 11:10.090
applications with the Food and Drug 
Administration to begin human clinical trials,

10:46.040 --> 11:10.090
which for us in our portfolio, we break down our 
portfolio of companies and that biotechnology to

11:11.453 --> 11:20.265
us, we have a more limited definition of 
biotechnology than I think most people in Texas

11:11.453 --> 11:20.265
have. We limit it to those companies that are 
involved in the fields of cell and molecular

11:20.905 --> 11:26.232
biology. And so this is recombinant DNA, 
monoclonal antibodies and that. Then we have what

11:30.438 --> 11:39.570
we just consider our medical biomedical 
technology, which are devices,

11:30.438 --> 11:39.570
instrumentation, things like that. And then 
there's health care services. In our portfolio

11:43.178 --> 12:01.457
of, say, 17, 18 companies, we really have three 
pure biotechnology companies, two that are

11:43.178 --> 12:01.457
biotechnology-related, and then the balance are 
medical device and instrumentation, excepting

11:43.178 --> 12:01.457
one, which is a service company. There are six of 
those companies, I think, that are here in the

12:02.138 --> 12:05.642
woodlands. and all three of the pure biotech 
companies. And the significance of those

12:09.079 --> 12:17.812
companies is that we almost should scratch the 
buzzword biotechnology. They're

12:17.852 --> 12:19.574
pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceuticals are 
the bread and butter of the health care industry in

12:20.436 --> 12:26.805
terms of that's where the big bucks are. It costs a 
lot to develop them, costs a lot to get them

12:27.045 --> 12:30.330
approved. When you sell them, you generate a lot of 
revenues, and they have high profit margins. And

12:37.541 --> 12:39.323
it's big business.

12:42.748 --> 12:51.619
Unless you use the context of Fortune 100 as being 
your definition, there aren't many small

12:42.748 --> 12:51.619
pharmaceutical companies. You're either big, or 
you're not in the business, or you're going to get

12:51.639 --> 12:55.605
absorbed by someone. And this is exciting, 
because the The biotechnology industry really

12:59.960 --> 13:07.531
evolved on the coast in the late 70s and early 80s. 
And I've always marked the 70s and early 80s as

13:07.551 --> 13:22.452
nationally being the science generation for 
biotechnology in the United States, where they

13:07.551 --> 13:22.452
were developing these tools of cell fusion and 
recombinant DNA. And then in 1986, the first

13:22.953 --> 13:29.562
couple, I think there actually were actually four 
bioengineered products approved by the Food and

13:30.132 --> 13:36.001
Drug Administration in 86. So I kind of marked, you 
know, the 86 as the beginning of the product

13:36.101 --> 13:43.453
generation nationally in biotechnology. Here in 
Texas, we really look at the 80s as being the

13:44.234 --> 13:54.891
science generation for biotechnology here, and 
it was mostly in the academic laboratories. And

13:55.462 --> 14:15.867
the 90s where we're real excited about this year is 
that, you know, in those three pure biotech

13:55.462 --> 14:15.867
companies, Houston Biotechnology, Argus 
Pharmaceuticals, and Zonagen, they were

13:55.462 --> 14:15.867
consumed with research and development 
throughout the period of time they existed in the

13:55.462 --> 14:15.867
80s. However, 1990 and 1991, each one of those 
three companies will be going into clinical

14:15.887 --> 14:24.137
trials with us. So now, that really marks the 
beginning of the product generation for

14:25.567 --> 14:31.075
biotechnology in Texas. And in that case, and each 
of those three companies is here in the Woodlands,

14:31.836 --> 14:44.235
Houston Biotechnology has a monoclonal 
antibody-based product that would prevent

14:31.836 --> 14:44.235
secondary cataracts from forming. And that, we 
estimate, is a worldwide market of at least $250 to

14:44.275 --> 14:50.324
$300 million. Argus Pharmaceutical has not one, 
but three products that we think they'll be in

14:54.642 --> 15:00.348
clinical trials within the next two years. But the 
initial product that they filed their IND with

15:00.448 --> 15:22.190
about a month ago is a formulation of a topical 
antifungal that now with our new formulation has

15:00.448 --> 15:22.190
indications systemically as both an antifungal 
and an antiviral. And because this won't be

15:24.292 --> 15:29.981
published before all this probably evolves along 
in the press. This drug has been tested at MD

15:30.502 --> 15:48.932
Anderson at the National Cancer Institute of the 
National Institute of Health in a very prominent

15:30.502 --> 15:48.932
laboratory there and has shown the greatest 
potency against the AIDS virus than any other

15:30.502 --> 15:48.932
drug, including AZT. And the significance is that 
not only does it prevent replication of the virus,

15:49.435 --> 16:08.275
but also it has shown an ability to in vitro kill 
HIV-infected cells, but not be toxic at all to

15:49.435 --> 16:08.275
healthy cells. And at the FDA, they've just been 
pushing us, literally, to get this in clinical

16:13.550 --> 16:15.513
trials. So we're very excited about that product. 
And there's still a lot of you never know. In

16:20.440 --> 16:24.446
clinical trials, it may pan out that it's not 
effective. But right now, all the indications

16:24.506 --> 16:27.770
look very positive. Then the third company, 
Zonagen, that's also out of Baylor College of

16:27.790 --> 16:33.178
Medicine. And we're proud of that. That's kind of 
our Texas product. network. We created the

16:40.751 --> 16:42.474
company. I'm the chairman of the board of that 
company. We're the lead investor, but then our

16:44.977 --> 16:56.713
other two major investors, one is Ross Perot, and 
the third is a venture fund called Triad that's

16:44.977 --> 16:56.713
headed by Lloyd Benson III. You've got Mitchell, 
Perot, and Benson, three big names in Texas,

16:57.494 --> 17:02.241
backing that. It's one of the most elegant, 
marvelous technology. It is a

17:06.830 --> 17:17.922
immunocontraceptive vaccine that has been 
funded by Dr. Bonnie Dunbar at Baylor College of

17:06.830 --> 17:17.922
Medicine for many years by the Mellon Foundation. 
She's been involved with the World Population

17:17.982 --> 17:27.472
Council, the World Health Organization to 
develop a contraceptive vaccine to prevent

17:17.982 --> 17:27.472
pregnancy in mammals. In her case, her grants are 
aimed towards a human contraceptive vaccine for

17:33.082 --> 17:35.165
third world countries like China and India. Now, 
when we, when I came across this at Baylor, I

17:35.446 --> 17:46.081
thought, you know, geez, from the moral, ethical, 
regulatory implications of human

17:35.446 --> 17:46.081
contraception, I'm not, I don't think I'm going to 
be interested. However, has anybody considered

17:46.101 --> 17:53.573
the commercialization of this product in the 
animal marketplace? And so we took it upon

17:54.414 --> 17:57.278
ourselves to evaluate that. And what we found, we 
have found out is that, uh, there's a 500 to $600

18:00.183 --> 18:12.699
million worldwide market, uh, for female dogs and 
cats to have a vaccine as opposed to having a

18:00.183 --> 18:12.699
surgical intervention. And, uh, it's, uh, it's, 
uh, the way that the product works, uh, and those,

18:13.460 --> 18:23.733
uh, parents side effects, uh, just a marvelous 
technology. So incidentally, Donna has been

18:23.753 --> 18:26.376
writing a history of, Veterinary medicine in 
Texas. Is that right? Is that right? Well, I think

18:29.779 --> 18:34.286
that's just going to be a major, major, major 
product. And we've been talking with Merck and a

18:34.366 --> 18:39.032
number of other pharmaceutical companies. 
They're really in the veterinary pharmaceutical

18:39.333 --> 18:44.700
area. We've had, in fact, the Merck people were in 
here two days in this very conference room about a

18:45.221 --> 18:50.068
year ago. And Merck has really got some smart 
people. And they... indicated to us that if you

18:55.617 --> 19:16.204
could just conceive it on the board today, even 
that which has not yet been invented or

18:55.617 --> 19:16.204
discovered, they can conceive of only five 
products that would be $100 million-plus

18:55.617 --> 19:16.204
products in animal health. One happens to be a 
product, the largest happens to be a product that

19:16.564 --> 19:20.650
they do have. It's called ivermectin, which is – I 
for almost any type of fungal about anything

19:23.478 --> 19:27.903
that's wrong with an animal. They give it 
ivermectin. It's and that's about a $600 million

19:29.165 --> 19:32.288
product. But then they said that the second 
largest product, if they existed, would either be

19:32.308 --> 19:42.560
a contraceptive vaccine or a flea vaccine, none of 
which exists today. And then the other two one they

19:43.221 --> 19:51.831
indicated would be a heart drug, which I thought 
was a little biased towards, you know, they're

19:52.165 --> 20:14.050
Yeah, they don't have it, but what a lot of these 
companies will do is they'll develop a human

19:52.165 --> 20:14.050
product, and then if they think the animal 
market's big enough, they'll adjust their

19:52.165 --> 20:14.050
program to modify their human product to be an 
animal product, and they have a human heart drug

19:52.165 --> 20:14.050
that I think they're planning on introducing in 
the animal marketplace, and there's one other one

19:52.165 --> 20:14.050
which escapes me right now. So if this works and 
field clinical trials, we hope to start – You know,

20:19.267 --> 20:21.972
by the middle of next year, you know, that'll tell. 
But our market research has indicated, you know,

20:22.292 --> 20:33.671
an 85, 90-plus percent acceptance rate of this 
product in the marketplace. And that company is

20:34.072 --> 20:35.495
here in the woodlands. So those three, Houston 
Biotechnology, Argus, Zonagen, are the three

20:35.535 --> 20:44.650
biotech companies in the woodlands. We have two 
device instrumentation companies. Excuse me,

20:50.682 --> 20:59.452
one, LifeCell Corporation was that first one 
launched out of UT, and that has probably the most

20:50.682 --> 20:59.452
esoteric technology that we came across. They 
have a process of ultra-rapid cooling followed by

21:00.153 --> 21:12.848
molecular distillation drying, which it's a very 
high-tech way of Freeze drying, right. It will

21:15.132 --> 21:18.897
preserve biological samples, if you will. And 
the, you know, the breakthrough here is that, you

21:19.578 --> 21:35.359
know, the problem when you freeze something is 
you'll either have damage due to ice crystal

21:19.578 --> 21:35.359
formation, or what you can do to mitigate that is 
you can subject the sample to a cryoprotectant.

21:38.106 --> 21:44.553
Typical ones are DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide, or 
some other things, and they're essentially

21:38.106 --> 21:44.553
antifreeze. And they will displace the water in 
the biological specimen so that you're not

21:44.573 --> 21:58.568
getting ice crystal formation, but of course 
these are chemicals and they're very toxic, so

21:44.573 --> 21:58.568
you're chemically altering the sample. What the 
life cell process does is, again, it uses no

21:59.108 --> 22:04.654
cryoprotectant, but it And by this ultra-rapid 
cooling, the water at the molecular level will

22:05.123 --> 22:13.137
form almost an amorphous or glass-like phase. But 
then by subjecting it immediately then to this

22:13.758 --> 22:25.860
vacuum that's the equivalent to an outer space 
vacuum, it causes these glass-like water

22:13.758 --> 22:25.860
molecules to sublimate the tissue. So what you 
have in the end is something that is structurally

22:29.609 --> 22:33.797
and chemically intact. And they were just, in 
fact, mentioned a big article in the Wall Street

22:33.817 --> 22:38.706
Journal about a month ago. They've received a 
number of grants from the federal government, and

22:39.488 --> 22:50.368
that particular one was from, I think, the Navy to 
preserve red blood cells like that. Uh, and that

22:50.753 --> 23:02.346
company, uh, we we founded that company and that 
was the first out of U. T. And this year they'll do

22:50.753 --> 23:02.346
about $1,000,000 in sales, uh, on their equipment 
side of their business. The things like red blood

23:02.426 --> 23:04.929
cells. Uh, you know, they're also working on 
preserving skin, a number of other things like

23:05.510 --> 23:10.916
that. You know, those are more like the drugs. 
They're going to be longer term in their

23:14.180 --> 23:17.183
development and application. Then the other 
device company that we have here, Optex

23:18.142 --> 23:27.592
Biomedical, had as its origin Texas A&M, although 
we were not involved in the formation of that

23:18.142 --> 23:27.592
company. There were four young scientists, three 
of them who were at A&M that had developed some

23:27.612 --> 23:37.222
optic fiber technology at A&M. And they, in fact, 
had licensed it from the university and gotten

23:38.123 --> 23:46.191
some funding from a group of doctors here in 
Houston initially. a few hundred thousand

23:46.694 --> 23:48.697
dollars. Then we came along, I guess, in about 1987 
or 88, and we led a financing that included a number

23:48.738 --> 24:00.999
of large institutional investors. And what 
they're developing is what we believe will be the

24:01.820 --> 24:12.398
world's first fiber optic-based real-time blood 
gas monitoring system. And we believe that on the

24:12.665 --> 24:17.832
device side, this is perhaps the hottest market. 
In fact, when we had an annual meeting, one of our

24:18.493 --> 24:27.085
annual meetings, I think it was two years ago, we 
had it down at the medical center. And Dr. DeBakey

24:27.386 --> 24:35.357
was kind enough to take us into his auditorium and 
visit with us for about 40 minutes. And it's

24:35.457 --> 24:37.440
interesting because Someone asked him, well, how 
are we going to stop rising health care costs? And

24:41.979 --> 24:44.103
he says, well, that's really very simple. Of 
course, everybody's, how can it be simple?

24:46.487 --> 24:48.410
Everybody's trying to figure it out. And he was 
being sarcastic, partly. But he said, there's a

24:53.297 --> 24:57.083
very simple answer to stop rising health care 
costs. That is, you stop all research and

24:57.584 --> 25:00.188
development. And he explains, he says, well, if we 
don't develop any new technology, then doctors

25:00.607 --> 25:11.582
won't find new ways to charge patients money. And 
the point he was making was, he's part sarcastic,

25:11.762 --> 25:25.821
but he was also saying that, you know, if you're a 
cardiologist and you're a good cardiologist, you

25:11.762 --> 25:25.821
could diagnose heart disease 20 years ago before 
they had this or they had that. If you're a good

25:31.259 --> 25:41.698
doctor now, basically what you're doing is if you 
can show anybody how to use this equipment,

25:31.259 --> 25:41.698
someone off the street could be able to diagnose 
heart disease. And there is some, and people are

25:41.878 --> 25:48.450
using it because of protection of liability. You 
know, if you're an anesthesiologist and you don't

25:48.768 --> 26:02.891
want to get sued because you lose someone, then 
you've got to use anything that anybody is using

25:48.768 --> 26:02.891
that would seemingly protect you and your 
information, you know, they're going to use. So

26:02.931 --> 26:05.215
there are more and more ways to charge patients. So 
he was being, you know, sarcastic, but he was

26:05.255 --> 26:14.329
partially being true, being honest too. But then 
having said that, Someone asked him then, what

26:16.797 --> 26:25.412
would be the next greatest breakthrough that you 
would hope for in the clinic? And he, without

26:25.672 --> 26:34.587
hesitating and having no idea what any of our 
companies were involved with, really, he said

26:25.672 --> 26:34.587
real-time blood gas monitoring. And so and we 
estimate at bare minimum that that, you know,

26:35.174 --> 26:45.386
medical devices, if you're addressing 50 to 100 
million dollar market, that's very large. And

26:45.466 --> 26:51.433
it's only usually these pharmaceutical products 
that address these, you know, multi hundred

26:45.466 --> 26:51.433
million dollar markets. But we estimate at and 
analysts around the around the globe estimate at

26:51.493 --> 27:03.506
least 300 million dollars and some as large as a 
billion dollars for that particular

26:51.493 --> 27:03.506
marketplace. And they are expected to launch 
their product next year. It has been FDA approved,

27:07.127 --> 27:14.501
but it has not been engineered down to its final 
ergonomic design. So we expect them to launch that

27:15.303 --> 27:17.407
next year. And that's a company, for example, that 
they are projecting that within three or four

27:17.647 --> 27:27.726
years they might have as many as 400 or 500 
employees. here in the woodlands. So that's

27:28.800 --> 27:35.267
almost Houston's medical version of compact 
computer. Well, that's exciting. Yeah, yeah.

27:36.929 --> 27:38.812
It's exciting.

27:41.875 --> 27:52.467
What is your, and I'm not sure we're ready for this 
question yet, but one thing that occurs to me so far

27:41.875 --> 27:52.467
is that Mitchell and the woodlands provided 
assistance in launching these things. And right

27:52.487 --> 27:57.493
now, you basically are spun off and are now 
separate independent venture capital company,

27:57.946 --> 28:08.636
and that you are here is

27:57.946 --> 28:08.636
almost coincidental or incidental to what's 
happening in and around the Woodlands. The

28:08.656 --> 28:14.802
Woodlands is complimentary and supplements what 
you're doing, but right now you're doing other

28:08.656 --> 28:14.802
things. In other words, the medical complex is 
not. No, and interestingly is that, again, way

28:18.725 --> 28:26.232
back when I was able to convince the Mitchell 
organization, that we have enough

28:26.785 --> 28:38.942
infrastructure or resource base here in Houston 
and in Texas to make this successful. And the

28:39.323 --> 28:48.856
woodlands, because I was going to use it as a tool to 
help me be successful in this, and the woodlands

28:39.323 --> 28:48.856
would benefit from it. But I convinced from, I 
certainly convinced Bud Clark, George, said he

28:54.612 --> 28:55.593
was convinced. He probably still hoped 
otherwise, but everybody accepted the fact that

28:55.613 --> 29:11.707
every company that we invest in can't be in the 
Woodlands, practically speaking, unless you

28:55.613 --> 29:11.707
can't exist on doing only a company whenever it 
happens to be one that you can locate here. So

29:11.747 --> 29:23.978
really, going back as far as probably 1986 or 87, 
they had agreed basically that I think they

29:11.747 --> 29:23.978
accepted the fact that I might know what I'm doing 
and that I have made investments outside of the

29:24.245 --> 29:29.130
woodlands. In fact, if we go back, you know, even 
starting in 86, and a good year for us was where

29:29.190 --> 29:37.379
we'll do three companies. And it has just 
historically fallen that one of those will end up

29:38.300 --> 29:50.252
in the woodlands, one of them will be Texas 
non-woodlands, and one of them will be outside of

29:38.300 --> 29:50.252
Texas.

29:51.042 --> 29:56.770
that prescription has worked well for us and has 
been accepted by them. The interesting thing, in

29:57.371 --> 30:08.027
1988-89, we became independent of Mitchell, but 
in all candor, his vision has not been lost by me.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.892
Number one is that his vision is an accurate 
vision. Number two, I'm very loyal to him. And

30:14.536 --> 30:19.243
number three, it has been a formula that has 
produced success for us. So even though our

30:19.645 --> 30:31.982
financial base is larger now, includes more than 
Mitchell, we operate exactly the way we operated

30:19.645 --> 30:31.982
in 1986, 1987. Does he still

30:32.423 --> 30:38.912
participate in any way or capital? He has, you 
know, Mitchell, and again, I just can't tell you

30:39.032 --> 30:47.003
how big of a fan I am of George Mitchell because... 
Certainly,

30:47.337 --> 30:57.889
going back to our Mitchell years, it was his 
company, it was his money, it was his initial

30:47.337 --> 30:57.889
vision. He could have suggested anything. And one 
of the things people asked me about was, well, do

31:01.333 --> 31:09.902
you ever get pressure from George to do this deal 
and that deal, or a friend, blah, blah, blah? And it

31:10.253 --> 31:17.724
has been perhaps because he himself is an 
entrepreneur and understands the process. He has

31:18.245 --> 31:22.210
never pushed us on doing anything. In fact, the 
contrary. Whenever, quote, one of George's

31:23.813 --> 31:35.670
alleged friends had a deal, those would be the 
times that he would call me saying, well, yes, I do

31:23.813 --> 31:35.670
or I don't know so-and-so very well. And this is 
what he's going to talk to you about, but I don't

31:35.887 --> 31:42.273
have any opinion about it. You just make your own 
judgment. Always supported me to let us make our

31:44.456 --> 31:49.060
own judgments. I spent, I remember in those early 
years in particular, we'd always prepare. And

31:55.206 --> 31:57.489
we'd do so much homework on these things. We'd be 
down there. And we were also out of time. And one of

32:00.732 --> 32:03.835
the reasons that I pushed us separating from 
Mitchell was you got to go back into the 86 and 87.

32:09.774 --> 32:10.395
Here we were. People were surely going into 
Mitchell's office saying, we want to drill more

32:12.157 --> 32:16.603
wells. Well, money's tight. We're not going to be 
able to do so much this year. Surely people were

32:20.809 --> 32:26.457
going in there saying, we want to pave new roads, 
and we want to do this in the woodlands. And surely

32:27.318 --> 32:29.501
they were getting, well, money's tight. We're 
going to maybe have to defer some of those to next

32:29.521 --> 32:33.687
year. He, even when oil was $9 a barrel, I went in 
there and I asked him for money to do this deal or

32:33.970 --> 32:42.400
that deal. 30 seconds later, I have it. He was so 
incredibly supportive of this thing, even during

32:44.924 --> 32:53.454
the worst of Mitchell's economic times. But 
nonetheless, and even though he was supportive, I

32:53.975 --> 33:00.523
personally felt that that must be very awkward for 
him. The presidents of Oil and gas divisions are

33:02.725 --> 33:15.379
probably wondering why Marty Sutter, who's 
investing in these things that no one knows

33:02.725 --> 33:15.379
anything, couldn't understand them and had no 
interest in understanding, why is George giving

33:02.725 --> 33:15.379
them money? So I told him, and I think I convinced 
him, that this

33:15.479 --> 33:24.009
is my vision. Maybe your vision was initially that 
this would just support the real estate

33:30.552 --> 33:36.699
development of the woodlands, and maybe my vision 
might have been this. But what's happened is that

33:37.399 --> 33:57.441
our visions have blended to being one and the same, 
and I'm committed to this strategy, to this

33:37.399 --> 33:57.441
operating mode, and it really doesn't matter 
whether you're the only pocket to back it or I get

33:37.399 --> 33:57.441
other pockets to back it. I'm going to do the same 
old, same old. and we have in fact followed that. In

34:02.394 --> 34:13.711
addition to his support now, we have funding from, 
we're the first venture fund that the University

34:02.394 --> 34:13.711
of Texas invested in out of its endowment. We're 
the first venture fund that the Meadows

34:13.751 --> 34:18.618
Foundation in Dallas invested in. We have the 
first Boston Corporation, Minnesota Mutual Life

34:19.519 --> 34:28.993
Insurance Company, the Delta Airlines Pension 
Fund, first city bank in town. the TISO

34:29.716 --> 34:34.804
organization in Switzerland. These people are 
all investing in this vision of taking this

34:35.865 --> 34:53.732
medical research that we have in Texas and 
commercializing it and, in fact, have recognized

34:35.865 --> 34:53.732
that the companies that Going forward, if we were 
in a horse race and we wanted to bet on, I tell you,

34:54.134 --> 35:20.037
I'd take these five or six we have here in the 
woodlands over the rest of them because they're

34:54.134 --> 35:20.037
origins from strong academic laboratories here 
out of the Texas Medical Center that we have been

34:54.134 --> 35:20.037
able from day one not to just get satisfied with 
management but go out and pick who we felt were the

34:54.134 --> 35:20.037
absolutely best people to run these companies. We 
have fostered the continued growth of that

35:21.050 --> 35:33.084
science through participating in research and 
development grants at the academic institution

35:21.050 --> 35:33.084
with the academic scientists there. And we have 
been able to bring substantial, sophisticated

35:33.785 --> 35:42.535
capital resources to these companies. How do you 
relate to the Houston Advanced Research Center,

35:43.021 --> 35:54.736
HARC, now in terms of this kind of development? 
There's less a direct relationship today other

35:54.897 --> 36:05.330
than Dr. Porter, who's the president of HARC, is 
the chairman of my scientific advisory

35:54.897 --> 36:05.330
committee. Nonetheless, as an institution, HARC 
has... Really, it's still too young in its life

36:12.097 --> 36:20.868
cycle to be a producer of technology. It has 
developed an infrastructure to do so. But number

36:25.754 --> 36:34.945
one, because initially our focus was on the life 
sciences, and there is not. There wasn't much

36:35.506 --> 36:37.969
interaction, although We have always 
anticipated that, prospectively, there will be

36:38.219 --> 36:41.604
some. And in fact, we have organized what's called 
the Research Forest Technology Association,

36:41.624 --> 36:54.525
which includes about 13 companies now, of which 
Mitchell is not involved. We felt that this was

36:55.246 --> 37:04.902
something that we needed to not have Uncle George 
hand-holding us, that we needed to take the

36:55.246 --> 37:04.902
initiative amongst ourselves. to form at our last 
breakfast. And the presidents of those 13

37:07.712 --> 37:13.400
organizations, we meet once a month and we discuss 
a variety of things. And Dr. Porter did tell us at

37:13.440 --> 37:20.750
the last meeting that he was planning on 
developing a program more life sciences

37:13.440 --> 37:20.750
oriented. So we think that either interventions 
off what they're doing today, and they have, they

37:20.770 --> 37:33.268
developed through the superconducting 
supercollider, they developed a magnetic

37:20.770 --> 37:33.268
resonance imaging magnet that may have some 
commercial value, and out of their laser

37:33.451 --> 37:43.242
applications research center, they developed an 
intervention there that they think might have

37:33.451 --> 37:43.242
some clinical value. We chose not to finance 
either one of those projects, but it was, and

37:43.823 --> 37:54.394
again, there's another example where George 
isn't pushing us on anything. He's letting us make

37:54.454 --> 37:56.957
our best judgment. In our particular case, us 
three partners have some you know, some adverse

38:02.594 --> 38:11.243
feelings towards high-cost capital equipment 
ventures, and that's why we didn't participate in

38:02.594 --> 38:11.243
the magnet. And on the laser side, we just fear that 
laser technology worldwide is advancing so

38:11.263 --> 38:26.779
rapidly that, in fact, the technology is probably 
advancing more rapidly than the clinical

38:11.263 --> 38:26.779
application. And we could be wrong, but that just 
happens to be our feeling towards those two

38:27.097 --> 38:32.682
things. So we didn't finance those, but we expect 
that they will be long-term a source of

38:32.702 --> 38:40.990
opportunities for us. Do you have any direct 
involvement with the Woodlands Corporation in

38:41.450 --> 38:47.216
your company or on the board or anything like that? 
None. We are presently totally independent of

38:48.717 --> 38:56.985
them, although, again, it's now because we've got 
this— this critical mass of 13 companies. I'm the

39:01.189 --> 39:08.097
chairman of the board of two of those companies, 
and we're clearly actively involved with all of

39:01.189 --> 39:08.097
them through the RFTA or what have you. We work, in 
the case of Mike Richman, I interact a lot with Mike

39:09.458 --> 39:26.938
because, again,

39:09.458 --> 39:26.938
I'm going to be selfish in that I'm going to be 
primarily interested in the success of these

39:09.458 --> 39:26.938
companies. And I have felt that the woodlands is a 
tool to help make them successful, the result of

39:27.492 --> 39:38.386
which will be strong and has been strong economic 
development of the woodlands. But the woodlands

39:39.046 --> 39:51.823
corporation is, you know, real estate people may 
think differently than technology

39:39.046 --> 39:51.823
entrepreneurs. So I think, and Michael Richman 
is, Not your typical real estate person. I think he

39:58.888 --> 40:01.694
shares the vision as well. And he is someone that I 
can go to who will be who I'll say, well, Michael,

40:02.034 --> 40:17.665
uh, you know, what you need to consider is you need 
to consider, uh, uh, some type of development of a

40:02.034 --> 40:17.665
facility that can be shared by these companies for 
this purpose. And. whereas maybe the average real

40:19.214 --> 40:27.392
estate person might say, well, what revenues is it 
going to produce, how much is it going to cost type

40:19.214 --> 40:27.392
of thing. Michael is going to be more inclined to 
understand the qualitative value of that in terms

40:27.993 --> 40:37.273
of, helping these companies. It doesn't matter 
how much it costs, if it helps or what the payback

40:38.545 --> 40:42.892
is. It's not as if it's not a factor. But more 
importantly, if it helps these companies be

40:45.737 --> 40:56.815
successful, it means that they stay here and they 
grow larger and produce more jobs or it helps

40:45.737 --> 40:56.815
attract other companies there. then Michael is 
usually willing to listen to those

40:57.183 --> 41:03.272
recommendations or suggestions. And because 
it's

41:04.053 --> 41:19.675
a little bit easier for me to explain those things 
to him than perhaps the single entrepreneur who's

41:04.053 --> 41:19.675
maybe just looking out for his company's own best 
interest. So we communicate a lot in that fashion.

41:22.698 --> 41:40.992
Maybe as sort of a concluding comment or anything 
you'd like to go on, fine, but would you comment,

41:22.698 --> 41:40.992
maybe now that you've reached this critical mass 
in terms of the biomedical community, what do you

41:22.698 --> 41:40.992
expect to happen over the next decade? A lot has 
happened, but not for the last decade, clearly. I

41:46.863 --> 41:53.231
think the biggest challenge that we're going to 
have, the good news is that we have some

41:46.863 --> 41:53.231
outstanding companies. Some of these companies 
are going to grow up and be, to different degrees,

41:54.953 --> 42:05.666
success stories a la compact computer. Some of 
these companies are going to grow up and be

42:06.587 --> 42:11.773
successful but be acquired. and may or may not have 
a lasting impact on the woodlands in Texas. And

42:17.902 --> 42:28.786
some of these companies, although we're almost 
more amazed and proud because we've had so few

42:17.902 --> 42:28.786
failures, but there will be failure. If there 
isn't failure, then we haven't been taking enough

42:28.806 --> 42:31.973
risk. And we believe that we have to be risk takers 
to hit home runs. And so a lot of that will evolve in

42:39.947 --> 42:43.612
the future. And to what degree, we're still not 
sure. Right now, we are immensely positive about

42:45.915 --> 42:50.680
the success of these companies. The good news is 
that we don't believe that the technology base,

42:51.361 --> 42:59.952
i.e., the academic creation, the academic 
discovery process is going to go away. I think

43:05.743 --> 43:13.212
we're, you know, we're going to, there's going to 
be challenges to continue to make sure federal

43:05.743 --> 43:13.212
grant money goes to all our fine academic 
institutions. We believe that's going to

43:13.272 --> 43:16.656
continue to be there and hopefully grow stronger. 
What we're going to get a net gain in is the fact is

43:17.456 --> 43:29.550
the, the management base, because just as when 
cardiovascular amnion cardiovascular systems

43:17.456 --> 43:29.550
amnion was sold, That was, for the Woodlands, that 
was not so good because, you know, they then were

43:30.357 --> 43:37.772
not a permanent resident of the Woodlands. But 
what it meant was the president of that company

43:38.172 --> 43:44.505
became my partner and is now working with me. The 
number two person at that company we hired to be the

43:45.046 --> 43:52.180
number one person at Optecstar. biomedical 
sensor company. So now we've got now a potential

43:55.470 --> 44:07.022
for a recycling resource base of intellectual 
talent, and that's very exciting for us. The big

44:07.562 --> 44:11.767
challenge going into the future is going to 
continue to be capital. Texas, in my opinion, will

44:12.868 --> 44:19.635
never be rich in venture capital. Uh, and that's a, 
you know, that's a long story itself, but just as,

44:20.577 --> 44:38.991
you know, there's, there's risk capital and 
there's risk takers here, but it's so much of it

44:20.577 --> 44:38.991
will always be tied into the land, oil, real 
estate, cattle ranching that. When it's going to

44:39.393 --> 44:43.998
be available is when those industries are doing 
well. When those industries are doing well,

44:44.599 --> 44:48.603
they're going to be recycled right back into it. 
Same is true with space industries, too. Exactly.

44:50.866 --> 45:04.000
So I really don't see that there's ever going to be a 
surplus or a wealth of venture capital for the high

44:50.866 --> 45:04.000
technology area in Texas. The ability of 
companies like ourselves and maybe a few others to

45:04.283 --> 45:14.373
fund these ventures is still a challenge that we 
have to look forward to. However, success breeds

45:14.413 --> 45:17.176
success. We were successful despite the fact that 
we were initially a corporate-sponsored venture

45:19.398 --> 45:28.347
fund, which many people look upon negatively. We 
were able to go out in a very difficult market and

45:28.947 --> 45:33.852
raise $22 million to you know, continue our 
efforts. And we believe the success of these

45:35.662 --> 45:49.136
companies, of which some of our most promising 
ones are here in the woodlands, will fuel our

45:35.662 --> 45:49.136
ability to raise additional capital and just keep 
this process growing and growing.

45:50.137 --> 46:04.092
Interestingly, my little personal insight is 
that we see no reason that we will ever diminish the

45:50.137 --> 46:04.092
importance of the medical biomedical technology 
as a part of our programs. Nonetheless, we believe

46:04.814 --> 46:13.763
that as opportunists that there are going to be 
other things here in Texas that are going to be

46:04.814 --> 46:13.763
attractive to us. And often it comes from a 
marrying of technologies. As an example,

46:16.465 --> 46:31.260
agriculture and biotechnology, waste 
management, environmental technology as it

46:16.465 --> 46:31.260
relates to both chemistry and biology. is going 
to, there's going to be advances made there. And we

46:35.509 --> 46:46.041
think that, you know, that number one, Texas has an 
attractive infrastructure to capitalize on that

46:35.509 --> 46:46.041
if there are, you know, people like ourselves that 
are out looking for it. And then within our

46:47.182 --> 47:01.078
particular community here, we believe that, you 
know, as HARC continues to grow, as we have

46:47.182 --> 47:01.078
successful companies here that attract 
intellectually

47:02.105 --> 47:07.018
brilliant people that have new ideas.
