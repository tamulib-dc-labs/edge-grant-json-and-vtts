WEBVTT

00:04.216 --> 00:06.780
And he lectured to us in rather large groups. He did 
a fantastic job. I never would have made it through

00:10.487 --> 00:25.954
chemistry without his help, without special 
help, and probably the special help from the Lord,

00:10.487 --> 00:25.954
because it was not a subject that I was 
particularly interested in. But I was very

00:25.934 --> 00:33.741
interested in English and Bloody Morgan was a 
noted character there on campus. He had a great

00:34.261 --> 00:46.152
sense of humor and everyone referred to him as 
Bloody Morgan because he was tough and a great

00:34.261 --> 00:46.152
teacher. He got your attention and kept your 
attention. Another one that I was very fond of was

00:49.615 --> 00:52.317
E.K. Spahr. S-P-A-H-R. He was, to me, one of the 
great professors of England. What did he teach? He

01:04.486 --> 01:05.207
taught English. English. Another

01:07.872 --> 01:16.707
was an ag-economic professor. Oh, I should never 
forget his name. Dan Russell? Dan Russell, I want

01:21.571 --> 01:39.918
to speak about him a little separately, but Dan was 
not one, this was the head of the department, a big

01:21.571 --> 01:39.918
fella,

01:21.571 --> 01:39.918
later helped me get the job with Anderson Clayton, 
head of the department, which sets my mind right

01:21.571 --> 01:39.918
now. You mentioned Dan Russell, Dan was loved by 
everyone and his, the work he did for the poor

01:50.917 --> 01:58.945
element of our students who came there wanting an 
education and just took a chance and came to A&M.

02:00.146 --> 02:19.185
They were told to look up Dan Russell and Dan had a 
home for boys down there right off campus and all

02:00.146 --> 02:19.185
the boys they got a few cows donated and they milked 
the cows and they turned the butter and they grew

02:00.146 --> 02:19.185
the gardens and they lived in that house and they 
were a fraternity all of them. And Dan Russell, we

02:23.258 --> 02:38.702
all need to venerate him for the good work he did in 
those early days, a man that we all love. Let's see,

02:38.722 --> 02:40.665
other good teachers, math. In math,

02:45.878 --> 02:52.367
That

02:45.878 --> 02:52.367
slips my mind. History?

02:57.434 --> 03:01.620
I reflect on Penberthy. Yes, please describe Mr. 
Penberthy. Mr. Penberthy was one of the most

03:04.724 --> 03:11.413
remarkable men that I had ever met and known. Penny 
knew more A&M students than anyone on the campus.

03:18.909 --> 03:28.520
He had a fantastic, retentive memory, and he could 
remember every student's first name, frankly.

03:29.281 --> 03:38.852
But he was

03:29.281 --> 03:38.852
one that anyone could go to and get good advice. He 
ran a very fine intramural program that was so

03:39.254 --> 03:55.012
vital back in those days with no girls, no 
entertainment, no TV, nothing, and the need for

03:39.254 --> 03:55.012
physical activity. We had softball, we had 
soccer, we had a little bit of everything,

03:55.933 --> 04:06.865
swimming, fencing, tumbling, And I got 
interested in tumbling because early on I had

04:07.300 --> 04:23.044
learned to walk on my hands and anyone who could 
walk on their hands and do a handstand and a few

04:07.300 --> 04:23.044
things like that just followed into the tumbling 
team. So we built a tumbling team there that for a

04:23.785 --> 04:33.240
number of years performed at every basketball 
game during the half. To this day, people told me,

04:34.115 --> 04:42.067
so they went to the basketball game to see the 
Tumlin team when they did just as much emotional

04:34.115 --> 04:42.067
when they did the basketball game. And Penny 
arranged for a trip every year for our Tumlin team

04:43.168 --> 04:50.960
to Texas, to the women's college at Denton. And the 
women's college up there looked forward to that

04:52.602 --> 05:03.598
and we went up there and spent the weekend and put on 
one or two exhibitions for them. And we

05:04.203 --> 05:08.309
entertained Roy and all that dates and stuff. And 
describe the social parts of those trips. Did you

05:12.956 --> 05:15.440
meet some attractive young ladies? Oh, yeah. Oh, 
we met some attractive young ladies. And of

05:17.343 --> 05:29.761
course, all of us back in those days at high school, 
we went to Austin as frequently as we could afford,

05:17.343 --> 05:29.761
which wasn't very often. It was still long 
distance when I was at college. And we... Our

05:33.683 --> 05:41.070
girlfriends on the football weekends came in on 
the train from Austin and went up to the junction.

05:41.991 --> 05:52.942
Into the junction and had to wait for the train 
coming from Dallas, and they would tie on to that

05:41.991 --> 05:52.942
train at Palo Alto Junction. I remember one time my 
date, Mary Johnson, who was the daughter of a

05:52.962 --> 06:02.391
farmer in San Antonio, She was in Catholic 
University and I invited her and she was coming

06:03.417 --> 06:10.584
over with a group. And when the train came in from 
Dallas, the train from Milano Junction from

06:10.604 --> 06:19.534
Austin was not on it. Uh-oh. And so, my gosh, we had 
no, we knew, we learned that Milano Junction, the

06:20.795 --> 06:32.327
train from Austin was late and they couldn't wait 
for it. So it was sitting at the junction up there,

06:33.083 --> 06:38.150
what was that, about 70 miles, 60 miles. I went to, I 
dashed down to Casey's. I said, Mr. Casey, I never

06:44.019 --> 06:53.733
ever asked you for a favor, although I had, I'd 
borrowed a few and five dollars from him here and

06:44.019 --> 06:53.733
there, you know, and always paid him back. I said, 
could I possibly borrow your car? I've got a girl, a

06:58.079 --> 07:02.145
whole bunch of girls up there. My line over judge 
told him what happened. He threw me the keys. It was

07:06.663 --> 07:07.084
a Buick. Unfortunately, I think I almost burned it 
up on the highway going up there. It picked up all

07:12.812 --> 07:18.601
those girls and as many as I could pack on that 
automobile, I think some of them were hanging on.

07:20.764 --> 07:21.585
We got them back. Let's see, we were talking about 
advisors and other important people at A&M. Were

07:30.345 --> 07:34.850
there some characters on the faculty and the staff 
then? Well,

07:36.572 --> 07:40.536
yes. You know, one man that I noticed in the 
military building there, what is it, the new Corps

07:41.137 --> 07:52.128
building? Yes, sir. There's a picture of all the

07:53.138 --> 08:03.754
military heads.

08:05.677 --> 08:10.364
Converse S. Lewis, his picture's not there. 
There's no notice of the fact that he was a PMSNT.

08:14.470 --> 08:15.671
And he was a very fine one. Regular Army officer and 
a great man. But he was a stickler. for certain

08:23.632 --> 08:28.379
things, and tough as a boot. I remember him well. 
Now, he was commandant? He was commandant. No, no,

08:32.044 --> 08:33.486
he was not commandant. He was a PMS&T. Oh, PMS&T. 
Yeah. And like in old days, that might have been the

08:37.391 --> 08:40.476
same thing. But the greatest commandant we ever 
had was Andy Anderson. Describe him, please, sir.

08:48.467 --> 08:52.272
Andy Anderson and his sweet red-headed wife two of 
the most loved people that ever taught on the

08:52.707 --> 09:02.117
faculty at Texas A&M University. Frank Anderson 
was a track coach, as we all know, and did a fabulous

09:02.317 --> 09:22.478
job in the track world, keeping us on the top shelf 
in that area at all times because he was a man of such

09:02.317 --> 09:22.478
work discipline such character and such love and 
whatever he did. But for about two years, he was

09:28.978 --> 09:33.603
asked to be common on the cadets. That would be when 
we were, I was a junior and senior then him. So he had

09:39.249 --> 09:41.311
both duties for those two years? Had what? Did he 
have both duties, track and? No, I think he gave up

09:45.075 --> 09:48.079
track at that time. He had, this was a full-time 
job. There were several areas where we conflicted

09:52.867 --> 09:59.616
as students with Frank. And there was an uproar, 
too, about it, but Frank always kept his cool, and

09:59.916 --> 10:10.670
what he was trying to do was right. The students 
were out of line. But he weathered the storm and

10:13.553 --> 10:17.098
handled it beautifully. And I have a letter from 
him in here somewhere. I'll show you. As you look

10:22.448 --> 10:29.859
back, what were the key courses that you took that 
were important in your later years? Well, I was

10:31.461 --> 10:51.932
always interested in cotton, having been born in 
Georgia and picked it over there and picked it

10:31.461 --> 10:51.932
here, and then worked for Cotton General and 
working for Cotton Seed Oil Man in the summertime,

10:31.461 --> 10:51.932
for Cotton Freight Broker and for Cotton 
Compress, going to Europe and studying it. But it

10:52.520 --> 11:03.651
was something that I always wanted to enter into 
and do as a life work, I thought. And so I took every

11:04.733 --> 11:08.617
cotton course that A&M had. And because of my 
background, I did excel and I won the Cotton

11:09.718 --> 11:16.064
Fellowship to Europe. I was so, which was such a 
great thing. because it was a challenge. And

11:25.399 --> 11:31.667
Bailey Conant from San Antonio and I, and a man 
named Hapton, there were three of us, one, two,

11:25.399 --> 11:31.667
three. I was one, Bailey was second, and Hapton was 
third in the selection process. And Luther Jones

11:37.515 --> 11:49.110
was a leader, selected leader, although this was 
under John Mogford's agronomies department at

11:37.515 --> 11:49.110
the time. And John was a lead son out of those groups 
to Europe for the winners of the Cotton

11:52.223 --> 12:05.256
Fellowship, but it was financed by the Cotton 
Ball, and the Cotton Ball was one of the big social

11:52.223 --> 12:05.256
occasions on the campus back in those days. We 
always had a named band. Describe the Cotton Ball.

12:12.023 --> 12:21.572
It was a social event, one of the big social events 
of the year, if not the social event of the year

12:12.023 --> 12:21.572
because we all had I had one from Corpus Christi. 
And they'd come up every two years, my junior and

12:27.105 --> 12:31.510
senior year. And Margaret Yarborough was my date, 
I remember. And, but others came from all cities of

12:36.916 --> 12:40.040
the state. And it was, as I say, we had a first-class 
named band. for those events, and it was one of the

12:47.202 --> 12:51.687
big weekends of the year. And through it, we raised 
money for this cotton trip to Europe, plus the fact

12:51.747 --> 12:59.216
that Anderson Clayton made up the shortfall. 
Anderson Clayton Cotton Company being the

12:59.236 --> 13:11.251
largest cotton firm in the world at the time, with 
headquarters in Houston, very interested in

12:59.236 --> 13:11.251
everything cotton-wise at A&M, supported it. And 
Will Clayton and his firm were very supportive. In

13:17.206 --> 13:28.999
fact, when we went on that trip to Europe, we were, 
we sailed out of Boston and we had a great trip over.

13:29.019 --> 13:42.874
We went to England, we went to France, we went to 
Belgium, we went to Holland, we went to Germany, we

13:29.019 --> 13:42.874
went to Switzerland, and all those places, in 
addition to New York, we studied the marketing of

13:29.019 --> 13:42.874
cotton. And it was a fantastic trip and 
opportunity. And I was blessed to enjoy and made a

13:46.771 --> 13:53.037
lot of difference in my life. I went to work for 
Anderson Clayton when I came out of school. I

13:58.221 --> 14:04.147
didn't stay in it, but of course the war, World War 
II came along and took me out. And I never did go back

14:04.868 --> 14:13.295
with them, although I had an opportunity when the 
war was over to go back with them. And they wanted me

14:13.455 --> 14:16.238
back. but that's another story. Were there other, 
we're talking about important courses, other

14:18.909 --> 14:28.599
courses that now that you look back on that had an 
important effect on your future?

14:31.522 --> 14:38.889
Well, the head of the Ag Economics Department, I 
couldn't think of his name a minute ago, was Dr.

14:31.522 --> 14:38.889
Barker. Barker, B-A-R-K-E-R.

14:45.515 --> 14:46.056
He was an unusual entrepreneur in his field in that 
he had contacts with business people all over.

14:59.262 --> 15:03.648
Highly respected in his field. He helped many, 
many a young man. He helped me in many ways. Took an

15:14.343 --> 15:18.068
interest in me. He taught a class and did a great 
job. Where did the faculty and staff members live

15:23.930 --> 15:27.114
in those days? Where did they live? Yes, sir. Where 
were their residences? You know, they lived in

15:31.981 --> 15:38.450
homes adjacent to the campus, mainly, if I recall.

15:41.875 --> 15:46.141
I recall visiting with the Andersons. They lived 
over there. on the south part of the campus there.

15:50.947 --> 15:55.874
Of course, our president, T.O. Walton, lived 
right on the campus. I sat on the swing of his front

15:58.358 --> 16:12.579
porch and visited with him as a senior and a junior 
because he leaned on us, the leaders of the Corps,

15:58.358 --> 16:12.579
and we had a very special relationship. His son was 
a member of our class, T.O. Describe President

16:18.443 --> 16:20.245
Walton.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.552
President Walton was a large man. I have a picture 
of him I can show you here taken with President

16:25.572 --> 16:35.345
Roosevelt when the President visited the campus. 
They were riding around the campus together and he

16:35.365 --> 16:40.151
was showing a very good picture of him. But T.O. was 
a very quiet man and I say T.O. Dr. Walton. but a very

16:47.958 --> 16:55.547
astute individual, and he had close contacts with 
F.M. Law, who at that time, if I recall, was either

16:55.587 --> 17:09.725
president of the Association of Former Students, 
or he later was on the board of, they didn't call it

16:55.587 --> 17:09.725
regents then, they called it- Board of Directors. 
Huh? Board of Directors. Yeah, the Board of

17:11.186 --> 17:15.872
Directors of the Governor's, and others, but He 
was a good president. He was, you know, he was a

17:18.438 --> 17:22.342
quiet man. Let's see, you mentioned President, 
did President Roosevelt come to the campus while

17:23.063 --> 17:26.767
you were there? Yes. Describe that visit if you 
remember it. Well, it was a great event. We never

17:32.173 --> 17:43.385
had seen a president before and he spoke at Guyon 
Hall or maybe it was an open meeting. I can't

17:43.485 --> 17:45.808
remember, but I do recall It was a very significant 
occasion. Were you all at all aware that Mr.

17:49.434 --> 17:53.600
Roosevelt was physically handicapped? Oh, yes, 
yes, definitely. He had a cane, but he was able to

17:55.302 --> 18:01.991
get around, and at that time, I don't believe he was 
in a wheelchair. Were there some other famous

18:02.492 --> 18:08.179
campus visitors you remember during your 
undergraduate days? Well, we had... Yes, we

18:12.886 --> 18:14.648
had...

18:17.227 --> 18:43.556
I remember a movie star, Fred McMurray, came and 
visited the campus and I had the pleasure of being

18:17.227 --> 18:43.556
sort of a host for him and he was quite a character 
and

18:17.227 --> 18:43.556
talked to the group and very interesting. I 
remember that.

18:49.728 --> 19:18.857
I

18:49.728 --> 19:18.857
already of course became governor at the time that 
we were our junior, our senior year and I was a

18:49.728 --> 19:18.857
member of the Ross Volunteers and we went over to 
take part in the government inauguration and hold

18:49.728 --> 19:18.857
the sabers for him and his wife to walk through and I 
have a good picture of that. You mentioned the

19:19.782 --> 19:23.787
Cottonball Band. What famous bands or music 
musicians came to the campus during those years?

19:31.035 --> 19:40.607
Well, we had a man I mentioned earlier, Bailey 
Conahan, who won the Cotton to a fellowship with

19:31.035 --> 19:40.607
me, was from San Antonio. And he was quite a, 
thought of an entrepreneur himself in the sense

19:41.488 --> 19:49.097
that he He stayed in touch with these bands and he 
had a way about him to get their attention and would

19:49.617 --> 20:00.913
dickle with them and get them there. We had all the, 
some of the top bands of the country back in those

20:01.434 --> 20:16.215
days and I swear at my age, my memory sometimes sort 
of, but name a few of them I'll tell you. Guy

20:16.415 --> 20:18.979
Lombardo, the Dorseys, Kay Kaiser. Yeah, that's 
right. I think we had them all at different times

20:20.501 --> 20:33.722
because he, for his junior and senior year, we had 
several balls and we had that type of top

20:20.501 --> 20:33.722
entertainment. And what did you young men wear and 
your dates wear to these dances? Well, the dates,

20:39.591 --> 20:44.498
you know, wore their fences, dresses and we wore 
our uniforms proudly. How was a young woman

20:49.268 --> 20:53.213
treated at A&M in those days at a dance? Like a jewel 
encased. Do you think they enjoyed coming to

20:56.718 --> 20:59.241
those? Oh yes, they looked forward to it so very 
much and all of them, whether they were duchesses

20:59.261 --> 21:10.536
of the cotton ball or of any significant one of 
these balls because one of the reasons they were so

21:11.377 --> 21:28.915
successful is that we did not have women on the 
campus and we needed that type of activity so that

21:11.377 --> 21:28.915
we could bring the girls in to the campus for 
significant occasions and give us a break. And we

21:29.795 --> 21:34.480
would, we had them several times a year. Where did 
they stay when they were in town? We had the inn of

21:37.003 --> 21:39.325
the The Aggieland Inn. The Aggieland Inn, and we 
put them in there. We put away the whole thing for

21:46.102 --> 21:48.865
them. That and the others would stay with various 
faculty members and families around the campus

21:48.885 --> 21:58.055
who would volunteer their homes. The YMCA played 
an important role. What all occurred at the Y or

22:01.799 --> 22:06.264
sponsored by the Y? The YMCA has been a great I've 
been a booster of the YMCA ever since I was a kid in

22:10.692 --> 22:15.798
Athens, Georgia. I know the good that it does and it 
did a great deal of good at A&M. Few people know that

22:24.587 --> 22:35.459
on the second floor of the YMCA they had a loan 
facility where they made loans to students. About

22:36.560 --> 22:39.383
five dollars to five hundred dollars or even three 
or four thousand dollars and they found the money

22:39.818 --> 22:49.528
somehow through various sources. That was before 
the college took over that operation pretty well

22:49.588 --> 22:55.834
as I remember this. I may be mistaken but I do know 
that that's why they had that. We had at that time we

23:00.338 --> 23:07.986
had no church on the campus. We, the YMCA, I'm just 
trying to think of the name of the, I can see him very

23:08.827 --> 23:19.042
plainly, the director of the Y at that time. 
Cashin? Cashin, after Cashin. Oh, this is after

23:23.088 --> 23:25.311
Red Cashin's dead? Well, I remember Cashin. I 
remember Cashin. Cashin, when he had an

23:28.716 --> 23:35.406
assistant, he was very active, tall, old glasses, 
I can't remember his name. But they were, active in

23:37.430 --> 24:01.404
many ways and we, the YMCA was a focal point for 
meetings and of course on the steps of the Y we had

23:37.430 --> 24:01.404
our Yale practice right opposite Hart Hall, a law 
hall there, every, Hart Hall, you know, every

23:37.430 --> 24:01.404
weekend. Was it called Midnight Yale Practice in 
those days? Yes. And who went to midnight Yale

24:06.657 --> 24:10.681
practice? I recall they got the freshmen out, the 
sophomores, and most everyone who could attend

24:10.801 --> 24:18.209
was there. There would be quite a crowd around. 
Let's see, Guyon Hall. What happened at Guyon

24:23.215 --> 24:25.197
Hall? Well, Guyon Hall, of course, was the one and 
only place we had on the campus back in the old days

24:25.217 --> 24:33.846
for graduation ceremonies or for any.

24:35.446 --> 24:40.693
gathering of that body.

24:43.277 --> 24:46.801
So we're talking about Guy and Hall and what all 
went on there. Let's start with the high point. Was

24:49.925 --> 24:52.128
commencement, your commencement there? My 
commencement was there. Please describe your

24:53.991 --> 24:55.773
commencement. Well, my commencement was like any 
other commencement.

25:01.321 --> 25:04.004
My family, of course, couldn't even come up. It was 
a hardship for them to even be there, but they were

25:04.927 --> 25:09.212
extremely proud. But I think,

25:09.232 --> 25:25.789
I remember we had a general present those awards to 
us, if I'm not mistaken, our graduation awards.

25:25.810 --> 25:33.718
Not a general, can't remember his name, but quite a 
prominent character. Now this was May of 1937.

25:41.441 --> 25:56.378
But any time they had any sort of presentation like 
the former students to the faculty winners of the

25:41.441 --> 25:56.378
awards, faculty awards, the mothers clubs used it 
for their meetings. The only thing is it was just

25:57.700 --> 26:00.723
too small. It came too small for us. Were there any 
religious activities held in Guyon Hall? Yes,

26:08.383 --> 26:09.284
there were. There were church services held there 
for a long time, and that brought on the chapel that

26:09.324 --> 26:21.576
we dedicated during my administration as 
president of former students. I'm very proud of

26:21.596 --> 26:22.216
that. We had a beautiful chapel there, and I wonder 
today if it's being used effectively. I

26:28.682 --> 26:33.507
understand it's being used for marriages, and 
many many services. I believe it is. Let's talk

26:36.437 --> 26:41.684
about the religious background of the students. 
In general, the student body was Protestant,

26:42.946 --> 26:50.056
Catholic, what? Yes, Protestant, Catholic, and 
many of the boys I know went to church on a regular

26:52.099 --> 27:00.912
basis.

27:02.680 --> 27:18.597
Many of them took that Sunday morning to relax and 
get sort of caught up and write letters and go to

27:02.680 --> 27:18.597
Austin, Houston. Were there any Jewish students 
then? Jewish? Jewish at A&M? Oh, yes. How were they

27:24.983 --> 27:25.864
treated? No one, as far as I'm concerned, there was 
ever any. whether it was, there wasn't any niggers

27:32.127 --> 27:39.554
on our campus, but had they been there, they'd have 
been treated like anybody else. Hispanics, one of

27:39.634 --> 27:59.713
my closest friends, Eduardo Longoria, he was, of 
course, from Laredo, and one of the great families

27:39.634 --> 27:59.713
in Mexico, but any Hispanic there was, we didn't 
have any racial difficulties. Were there any

27:59.733 --> 28:01.695
international students? I don't know of any, but 
I'm sure there were a few. But they were usually

28:08.505 --> 28:14.851
students who were there working with a doctorate.

28:16.413 --> 28:18.194
They were not in the Corps of Cadets. Let's see, 
let's jump back to commencement. What did you wear

28:22.919 --> 28:27.143
to, when you graduated, what did you wear to 
commencement ceremony? How many uniforms do I

28:29.365 --> 28:31.227
remember? And every graduate attended? Oh, yeah. 
Let's see. The big student groups. If you or I in

28:43.621 --> 28:55.918
that era could have held any student office on 
campus, what would have been the prize honor as an

28:43.621 --> 28:55.918
A&M student in that? For me to be the regimental 
commander of the cavalry, which I was, That was my

29:01.328 --> 29:04.453
number one goal and I achieved that. And the other 
would be to be in the top

29:05.474 --> 29:30.390
10 of the graduation class and be possibly 
valedictorian, but I really had never had any

29:05.474 --> 29:30.390
dream that I could be there, but I made it in the top 
10 and we selected, the top 10 selected the

29:05.474 --> 29:30.390
valedictorian, who was Jimmy Powell, who was my 
captain and they trooped Calvary when I was

29:31.163 --> 29:35.549
regimental commander of the Calvary. Power, 
P-O-W-E-R? Power, James A. Power, Bartlett,

29:39.054 --> 29:42.759
Texas. Now, these, back again about the students, 
by and large, were these students from any

29:42.779 --> 29:54.315
particular section of Texas, or was pretty well 
the whole state of Texas covered by the student

29:42.779 --> 29:54.315
body? Oh, the whole state of Texas, everywhere 
from El Paso to, you know, In Shreveport, we had

30:01.150 --> 30:08.200
some out-of-state students, not many, but Jack 
Creighton was in Shreveport, I recall. But all

30:09.361 --> 30:30.010
parts of the state, that's one of the great things 
about A&M in that sense that, you know, it took us

30:09.361 --> 30:30.010
out of the,

30:09.361 --> 30:30.010
you know, just your home jurisdiction area and a 
statewide school interested in the world. And

30:30.260 --> 30:35.308
they were country and city, from the country and 
from the city. All walks of life. Some poor and some

30:37.191 --> 30:39.094
well-to-do. Absolutely.

30:43.220 --> 30:55.900
The thing about

30:43.220 --> 30:55.900
my class of 37, as I see it, it's been a very 
successful group. We've had men who I say vice

30:57.563 --> 31:01.507
president of Shell Oil Company, Jim Wilson. Jack 
Creighton and Andy Grew, they're two of the

31:01.527 --> 31:06.992
greatest geologists in the world today.

31:11.276 --> 31:14.179
Frank Poole, well, he's just a good friend. He was 
the last to ask me, but he built the world's largest

31:14.199 --> 31:21.266
oil servicing company. But our people, however 
you look at them, they were leaders. to become our

31:27.500 --> 31:38.240
commander of the corps, head lead, president of 
the four-eyes shovel, gravel company. Bill

31:40.183 --> 31:41.205
Kelly.
