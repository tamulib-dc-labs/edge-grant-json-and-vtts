WEBVTT

00:05.785 --> 00:24.114
Well, Dr. Burns had a nice collection of dried 
poisonous plant specimens stored in Francis Hall

00:05.785 --> 00:24.114
over on campus. That's where he taught plant 
toxicology. And he had accumulated these. So

00:34.085 --> 00:37.729
those were among the things that were to be moved.

00:41.372 --> 00:53.705
He

00:41.372 --> 00:53.705
assigned, well, that was one of the, I can't 
remember. I was trying to think of who it was.

00:59.671 --> 01:00.852
It was involved with that. Helms was involved. who 
I think, he was probably the main one that was, got

01:04.460 --> 01:17.052
the idea that we'll just switch these, you know, 
we'll change the plants and the labels out. Won't

01:18.113 --> 01:32.627
that be entertaining then for the next class that 
Dr. Burns, because Dr. Burns, the only reason that

01:18.113 --> 01:32.627
that would even occur maybe to someone would be 
because, Dr. Burns was quite a storyteller and

01:33.721 --> 01:58.821
with most of those specimens he would, he could go 
on at some length just holding a specimen before

01:33.721 --> 01:58.821
the group and not only talking about what the 
effects would be but where it was exactly that he

01:33.721 --> 01:58.821
got that specimen and what the weather was like on 
that particular day. I mean he could just He could

02:00.417 --> 02:06.063
just amaze you, you know, going back in time and 
getting into great details. And so the thought was

02:07.385 --> 02:17.316
that, well, he would pull out St. John's Ward or 
something like that, you know, and he would just

02:07.385 --> 02:17.316
look at the label and he would start talking about 
it. And maybe if you had, if something entirely

02:17.416 --> 02:30.390
different, obviously different, was in the 
folder, if he didn't look at it, well, it would

02:17.416 --> 02:30.390
be... amusing into one mindset. So that was done, 
but then, of course, Dr. Burns, once he got out

02:36.951 --> 02:44.882
there, well, he went through each one of them. Oh, 
he checked them. He checked everything, yeah. I

02:49.009 --> 03:01.187
know my involvement, I developed a new 
appreciation for the thoroughness and

02:49.009 --> 03:01.187
meticulous nature of a man because I was assigned 
to count to inventory all of the rubber stoppers,

03:01.741 --> 03:11.974
which, when you say that, you think, well, an hour, 
maybe. My gosh, he had rubber stoppers, and he had

03:13.456 --> 03:25.030
reserves,

03:13.456 --> 03:25.030
and he wanted everything counted, you know, in 
every size. He wanted all of the different sizes. I

03:28.842 --> 03:51.548
spent, I don't remember how long, but boy, and I 
tried, one of the reasons I spent that long was

03:28.842 --> 03:51.548
because shortly after I started, I kind of 
generalized and estimated, and I gave him a report

03:28.842 --> 03:51.548
when I was going off duty, and so when I came back a 
couple of days later, I had some time. He had a

03:51.929 --> 03:58.056
little session with me, and he wanted me to 
understand that My initial count was not

03:59.791 --> 04:05.240
satisfactory, and he did not intend an estimate. 
He could estimate. He wanted a count.

04:10.829 --> 04:13.694
When you were in vet school, was there an honor 
system? Yes. As far as you know, did students

04:15.416 --> 04:17.640
follow it? Well, I lost a classmate in my freshman 
year. uh for cheating and this was done by the uh and

04:27.466 --> 04:54.756
there was guilt the honor council there was uh-huh 
were there others that you may have known about

04:27.466 --> 04:54.756
that were not caught not to my knowledge did you all 
sign an honor pledge yes uh-huh was there an

04:27.466 --> 04:54.756
explanation early early in the first year to 
explain what the honor system covered and

04:27.466 --> 04:54.756
everything

04:57.773 --> 05:01.960
I've wondered why shouldn't the Corps have done 
that long ago? Yeah, this was part of that first

05:01.980 --> 05:08.390
lecture, I think, with Al Price. I believe that's 
when we got that. I

05:11.655 --> 05:20.168
presume you're very proud of your A&M veterinary 
training. Why are you proud of it? What are the

05:23.153 --> 05:25.857
foundations of that pride?

05:28.857 --> 05:51.878
Well,

05:28.857 --> 05:51.878
the faculty that taught me in vet school was, of 
course at the time I was a student, well I respected

05:28.857 --> 05:51.878
them as faculty, but It was really in years after 
that that I think I developed my sense of

05:52.111 --> 06:08.532
appreciation for them and respect for them as it

05:52.111 --> 06:08.532
became fully developed. You know, we had only 
30-something faculty. And so all of the

06:13.198 --> 06:16.482
department heads, for example, all of the 
department heads in the vet school had

06:16.951 --> 06:44.207
substantial teaching loads and in general they 
taught the lead courses in their discipline and so

06:16.951 --> 06:44.207
to be able to go through with a group of very very 
respected faculty of that stature, I've always

06:45.892 --> 06:53.720
felt very fortunate that I was able to do it. You 
know, really and truly at the time that I finished,

06:55.062 --> 07:09.557
I had no way to know from a comparative standpoint 
how my education compared with what it might have

06:55.062 --> 07:09.557
been in some other state. But as time has passed, 
well, I've developed my appreciation for my

07:16.655 --> 07:27.329
education at Texas A&M has been increased.

07:31.174 --> 07:36.922
Commencement, veterinary commencement was 
held, describe it as much as you recall, your year.

07:38.925 --> 07:39.666
Where was it held? Well, it was in G. Raleigh White, 
which was the new gym. And we were seated on the

07:46.422 --> 07:58.943
floor, the main floor, I remember, and this was 
in... Was it just for vet school? No, no, it was...

08:00.907 --> 08:04.052
Y'all were part of the larger one. Uh-huh.

08:08.179 --> 08:09.842
And this is the spring of 57. 57. Mm-hmm. And it was, 
we were on, this was on Saturday morning. I don't

08:16.314 --> 08:19.157
think, I think that was the only one. And who came? 
The only commencement. Who came as your

08:22.521 --> 08:25.143
supporters? Well, my parents were there and Ann's 
parents were there. Oh, now you had met Ann by then.

08:30.829 --> 08:37.776
Yeah, well, we married after my, at the end of my, 
well, on Saturday. August 31st before my last

08:38.330 --> 08:41.073
year. Oh, I forgot. So she was down here for that. So 
where did you all live that fourth year? Well, we

08:49.522 --> 09:07.341
started out living in a duplex on Church Street 
there just where it's now gone for the, well, it was

08:49.522 --> 09:07.341
one block west, half a block west of A&M 
Presbyterian Church. belonged to Zubik. It was an

09:12.287 --> 09:17.675
apartment, a little duplex that belonged to Mr. 
Zubik. But after, in October, I heard about one of

09:18.556 --> 09:34.999
the new large animal clinicians needing, looking 
for a married vet student with no children who

09:36.211 --> 09:43.023
would move in with him and look after his little 
boy. So this was Bill Romaine and little Bill. And

09:47.250 --> 09:49.294
so we did that. Lived over on Jersey Street and 
across the street from the basketball coach that

10:02.215 --> 10:27.750
had been brought in from the northeast that was to 
oh yeah yeah yeah um the one before shelby before

10:02.215 --> 10:27.750
shelby between rogers and shelby i can't think of 
it right now but anyway we lived over there across

10:02.215 --> 10:27.750
the street from him on jersey street and uh And so 
when, how did you, what were your future dreams

10:29.047 --> 10:37.054
when you graduated? What did you think you were 
going to do? Well, I had already agreed to accept to

10:39.136 --> 10:46.283
take the instructorship in anatomy. And my plan 
was to,

10:47.824 --> 10:56.792
at that point, was to evaluate

10:57.346 --> 11:17.113
education as a career possibility and

10:57.346 --> 11:17.113
but I still felt I felt it at the time that I stayed 
and made the decision that I still felt compelled

10:57.346 --> 11:17.113
to go into practice and evaluate that further. Now 
this this job this instructorship what was the pay

11:17.894 --> 11:21.800
of that? Well it was

11:27.805 --> 11:55.753
it was fifty one hundred dollars for twelve months 
and uh... uh... dr armistead got into trouble with

11:27.805 --> 11:55.753
that as i learned later because pat hubert who had 
graduated two or three years before was making

11:27.805 --> 11:55.753
only five thousand in large animal clinic

11:27.805 --> 11:55.753
and uh... So as you walked across the stage, it was 
then every name called, every hand shaken,

11:57.708 --> 12:13.874
and you felt optimistic about your future. Yeah. 
If you were now giving advice to the College of

12:17.420 --> 12:24.812
Veterinary Medicine leadership, You're now 
their consultant. You're giving them advice

12:28.576 --> 12:38.872
about undergraduate or non-graduate

12:28.576 --> 12:38.872
post-DVM training. What advice would you give 
them about veterinary instruction, the DVM

12:39.313 --> 12:51.692
instruction?

12:52.433 --> 12:54.917
What to hold on to and what to... I'd

12:55.572 --> 13:07.143
have to think about that, I believe, because, see, 
it is so different now to anything. And I know it's

13:08.104 --> 13:13.049
different, but I don't know the particulars of 
that difference. See, there are,

13:13.069 --> 13:23.419
the students

13:13.069 --> 13:23.419
have, they interact with, with many more faculty 
members. And only

13:26.981 --> 13:44.367
a portion of those faculty are

13:26.981 --> 13:44.367
knowledgeable, really knowledgeable, of the 
profession that the students are preparing for.

13:45.469 --> 13:47.532
Because they're not veterinarians. They are 
research people. In many instances, most

13:50.872 --> 13:57.041
instances, they're quite successful in their 
research endeavors. And they are doing this as

13:57.822 --> 14:04.873
part of the obligations of their position. And 
that's where we've evolved to, I guess. So I don't

14:11.323 --> 14:14.948
know.

14:18.754 --> 14:19.495
Best I can. that I've been able to determine in the 
last 10 years of observing that this seems to, you

14:19.947 --> 14:32.909
know, I don't see any major deficiencies coming 
from it, but I really don't know. Alright, then the

14:34.592 --> 14:41.683
last thing I have to ask is what feelings do you 
carry in your heart for Texas A&M today?

14:45.810 --> 14:46.191
Well, It's just A&M is a part of me.

14:56.844 --> 15:01.129
I'm not a rah-rah type supporter, if you will.

15:04.614 --> 15:17.410
But

15:04.614 --> 15:17.410
what happens is very important in the way of things 
being done well. You know, I'm so pleased that we

15:18.031 --> 15:28.585
have had the president we've had in the last few 
years. I can see it takes no imagination at all to

15:29.225 --> 15:42.903
see how that tragedy could have been visited upon 
tragedy with this bonfire thing if we had not had

15:29.225 --> 15:42.903
the right person there. And I think he was about as 
right as I can think of anyone. any other person or

15:47.157 --> 15:55.405
any other traits that I would have liked to have 
seen in command at that time.

15:58.608 --> 16:15.443
I'm

15:58.608 --> 16:15.443
very pleased and have just really been amazed 
through the years at how the student body has

15:58.608 --> 16:15.443
continued at Texas A&M, the student body has 
continued to be hold the values, hold the same

16:16.705 --> 16:29.802
things important that we did when I was in that 
small group of chauvinistic male students,

16:16.705 --> 16:29.802
non-segregated. I mean totally segregated. What 
creates that spirit? Why? It's a puzzle to me. I

16:37.071 --> 16:39.434
have spent a lot of time thinking about that. Now 
certainly there are a lot of other influences that

16:40.636 --> 16:46.223
the new students go through. I've never been to a 
fish camp, for example. I'm curious what the

16:50.297 --> 16:53.841
environment is there. I can't help but wonder if 
fish camp isn't a several day enactment

16:53.941 --> 17:12.683
of what we used to get in the halls of what I got in the 
hallways of dorm 14 after CQ each night for the

17:13.456 --> 17:18.021
first month. That was routine. We were in CQ 
studying until 10.30 or 11 o'clock on Sunday and

17:20.524 --> 17:28.394
Wednesday night. And then we would have anywhere 
from a half hour to two or three hours in the halls

17:29.615 --> 17:40.408
with one of the upperclassmen at a time holding 
forth a discourse on this or that or the other about

17:41.873 --> 17:57.802
A&M and what you shall do and what you shall not do 
and so on.

17:58.103 --> 18:02.751
Can A&M Spirit really be described to somebody 
that hasn't experienced it? I can't imagine it. It

18:07.418 --> 18:13.687
can be described, but I can't imagine there being 
an appreciation for what has been described.

18:16.451 --> 18:30.391
You know, we were in... Ann and I were... Ann 
accompanied me to a meeting in Chicago, and we were

18:16.451 --> 18:30.391
there when the bonfire collapsed. And...

18:33.815 --> 18:47.473
The news accounts and the interviews seem to 
communicate to some of the people on the street

18:33.815 --> 18:47.473
types there in Chicago. I know when we were on our 
way out and we got to, we took a cab out to O'Hare and

18:47.493 --> 19:03.535
when we unloaded our luggage, well, there was an 
A&M sticker on stuck on one of them and there was a

19:04.122 --> 19:25.219
black man one of the people working there who saw 
that and asked us about the bonfire and it was

19:04.122 --> 19:25.219
almost he was emotional about it about the tragedy 
of it and he expressed a curiosity about that

19:25.705 --> 19:54.784
school and asked two or three questions about is it 
really true that the students do this or and I was

19:25.705 --> 19:54.784
struck by by how you

19:25.705 --> 19:54.784
know all of the interviewing and all of the time 
that had been devoted to that that it that some of

19:57.447 --> 20:02.772
the people were getting a little bit of an insight. 
Of course, many others only saw it as akin

20:04.193 --> 20:13.801
to a college prank gone awry type thing.

20:19.687 --> 20:23.150
What I'm looking for is the form that you and I need 
to sign. And I believe that I have, for the first

20:24.111 --> 20:26.813
time, fail to bring one. So I'll have to get that out 
to you.

20:37.582 --> 20:44.930
So let's close with what are your hopes for A&M 
future, particularly in veterinary medicine?

20:48.814 --> 20:56.682
Well,

20:48.814 --> 20:56.682
I'd like hope that they're able to

20:56.948 --> 21:23.091
maintain the course that they're on right now I 
guess I don't see a need for well they're little

20:56.948 --> 21:23.091
things but I won't I don't see that those need to be 
they're not that important but when you when I look

20:56.948 --> 21:23.091
at the the course that the vet school is on, we have a 
real strong,

21:23.712 --> 21:37.666
the students are adequately educated before they 
get to the clinics. They have a tremendous

21:38.427 --> 21:41.650
clinical education program. And

21:43.852 --> 21:52.521
there

21:43.852 --> 21:52.521
is truly a a broad based research program it's both 
basic and clinical so you're on a real good course

21:53.750 --> 22:22.879
right now I we

21:53.750 --> 22:22.879
could talk about them taking leadership in in 
going to new forms of education where of

21:53.750 --> 22:22.879
veterinary education where parts of it are done 
away from the main campus. That's for a later

22:28.941 --> 22:33.306
generation than me. I'm too much of a 
traditionalist to be advocating

22:33.387 --> 22:44.040
that.

22:48.998 --> 22:54.605
I'd like to see them really continuing on in the 
direction that they are. There is a, you know, I do

22:55.106 --> 23:15.411
have a concern, I guess, for veterinary medicine 
in general and that is I don't know where the

22:55.106 --> 23:15.411
faculties of the future will come from other

22:55.106 --> 23:15.411
than the people whose primary strength is 
research. I do not feel that veterinary education

23:26.479 --> 23:43.947
can be successful without there being a core of 
veterinarians involved as teachers. And there

23:44.956 --> 24:04.905
are,

23:44.956 --> 24:04.905
it's becoming

23:44.956 --> 24:04.905
less and less attractive, well veterinary 
academia is becoming less and less competitive

23:44.956 --> 24:04.905
all the time and this is not from the standpoint of 
money. is salary differentials. That's not the

24:08.553 --> 24:09.854
big issue. The big issue is the problem with,

24:10.455 --> 24:19.163
well, longevity. You know, I still feel in my 
discussions even in recent years that veterinary

24:20.384 --> 24:32.715
medicine, I think, could prosper if we could just 
get tenure completely out of the picture and just

24:33.100 --> 25:00.643
have i think that there would be a lot of people in 
veterinary medicine who would be interested in

24:33.100 --> 25:00.643
going into academia without any lifetime 
assurances of employment or anything that's the

24:33.100 --> 25:00.643
way i that was never a consideration for me in 
whether I would go into academia or not, was that,

25:01.366 --> 25:11.899
well, if I do that and if I can get by the first few 
years, I'll be set for life. That's not part of it at

25:12.600 --> 25:15.584
all. But, you know, the thing that's so crippling 
with the tenure system is you're either in or

25:15.985 --> 25:23.274
you're out in a few years. And with the 
opportunities in industry and a number of other in

25:31.994 --> 25:37.670
private diagnostic laboratories and research 
labs and things like that.

25:42.543 --> 25:44.047
There's no problem with that. Neither are they 
guaranteed a lifetime employment. But also, they

25:48.582 --> 25:55.110
are not treated as second-class citizens after 
year six or seven or whatever. But you're, in

25:56.091 --> 26:01.979
summary, you're optimistic about the program 
today and where it's headed. Well, I am, uh-huh, as

26:02.299 --> 26:09.968
far as the iteration that we have here for 
veterinary medicine. But I am, the one concern I

26:10.609 --> 26:16.176
have is,

26:19.210 --> 26:38.752
to address the need to

26:19.210 --> 26:38.752
eliminate this big problem in recruiting and 
attracting bright young people into a veterinary

26:19.210 --> 26:38.752
career. We've had two or three of the people that I 
was involved with most recently in their training

26:39.653 --> 26:48.222
who have just been Well, they weren't really just 
bought by industry, but they were offered very

26:48.725 --> 26:56.132
lucrative situations. But the final nail was 
driven by the uncertainty of what tenure would do.

27:06.661 --> 27:12.246
Yet when they went to their jobs, they did not go to a 
lifetime position.

27:15.429 --> 27:18.732
And so somehow we need to be able to address that. 
I'm sure that's not just in veterinary medicine. I

27:23.845 --> 27:39.387
was enticed into academia, as I see it, at the 
beginning of a an expansion of veterinary medical

27:40.919 --> 28:09.272
education in North America you know we had a number 
of veterinary schools that were established in

27:40.919 --> 28:09.272
the sixties and seventies they required more 
faculty and we had of course before that well a

27:40.919 --> 28:09.272
number of the existing veterinary schools 
increased their enrollment which required more

27:40.919 --> 28:09.272
faculty and Armistead was one of the visionaries 
that saw that well these 34 faculty members aren't

28:10.079 --> 28:17.188
going to be equal to the task of classes of 100. And 
where are we going to get the people? So he had

28:20.892 --> 28:28.201
already started these instructorships, and that 
was the best he had at that time.

28:31.045 --> 28:38.314
Because the pool of faculty had gotten very, very 
small. And I'm concerned that we're going to be

28:39.340 --> 28:53.958
looking at that in the future here in this country 
and at A&M even, that one of these days you're going

28:39.340 --> 28:53.958
to wake up to the fact we're going to need some more 
faculty. And where are we going to get them? This is

28:55.660 --> 28:58.243
not something you do in a year or two. Armistead was 
starting it, and other places were starting it in

28:58.643 --> 29:03.569
the mid-50s. And yet it really wasn't critical 
Didn't become critical until the mid 60s. So about

29:12.773 --> 29:39.638
a 10 year you need about a 10 years Jump on it and I 
don't see that happening anywhere really We were

29:12.773 --> 29:39.638
really losing There

29:12.773 --> 29:39.638
has been a decrease in the number of funded 
graduate positions graduate training positions

29:12.773 --> 29:39.638
I think is compared to in the 80s whenever I think 
that's when it peaked in veterinary medicine and

29:42.706 --> 29:47.289
So that's gonna need, we're gonna need that 
turnaround sometime in the future. Let's quit

29:48.233 --> 29:48.917
with that. I found the sheet.
