WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:17.765
Although I was very much personally involved in 
what I was doing outside

00:01.060 --> 00:17.765
the press, it was obvious that there was a lot of 
turmoil going on, but I did my all-power best to

00:01.060 --> 00:17.765
stay out of it. That's the mark. We had that

00:19.407 --> 00:29.783
ministry. Yeah. Let's

00:30.608 --> 00:44.550
say now, when Mary Miller comes, was there a, did 
you sense at that point, some kind of a relief?

00:46.167 --> 00:56.823
Well, I should say that in 1990, I moved from the 
editorial department to the marketing

00:46.167 --> 00:56.823
department, so I suddenly had a completely 
different perspective of everything. Now, at

00:58.366 --> 01:03.754
that point, in terms of marketing, your time 
was...

01:05.894 --> 01:07.577
I had so many different titles. I noticed 
everybody got kind of a soft federal title. Yeah,

01:11.783 --> 01:17.051
because at the time, when I left the editorial 
department, I was the associate editor. And when I

01:17.893 --> 01:27.728
had decided to move over here, both of the two young 
women working in the marketing department had

01:17.893 --> 01:27.728
both quit simultaneously. That was Marilyn Gaeta 
and Sarah Oates. And so I basically took the best

01:34.700 --> 01:42.309
parts of both of those jobs

01:34.700 --> 01:42.309
and made it. And we got one job out of it. And so I was 
primarily doing publicity, and we had a several

01:42.930 --> 02:01.872
year attempt

01:42.930 --> 02:01.872
to have me acquire and develop reissue books, 
which I wasn't particularly interested in doing

01:42.930 --> 02:01.872
it, but it had to be done. So I was supposed to do 
that. Second edition? Yeah, reissues and

02:05.873 --> 02:14.068
paperback,

02:05.873 --> 02:14.068
that type of thing. We've never really had a 
paperback policy that's been approved. I really

02:19.317 --> 02:22.582
don't. At the time that I was supposed to be 
acquiring the issues, Mark and me worked on

02:22.602 --> 02:35.503
developing guidelines for what we could and 
couldn't do. It was a great deal of work that had

02:36.175 --> 02:45.536
nothing whatsoever to do with the other work that 
we were doing, that I was doing. Completely

02:45.556 --> 02:46.818
different. You know, it's like in the middle of the 
day, you know,

02:46.838 --> 02:53.313
that hat would be switching off and on. It was 
tough. Well,

02:54.637 --> 03:14.157
I didn't actually get any responsibility in the 
advertising media planning until a couple of

02:54.637 --> 03:14.157
years ago when Marianne was in the marketing 
department. She did all of the advertising

03:14.177 --> 03:21.404
planning and she did all the advertising design. 
Joan does the advertising design now, but I do all

03:21.424 --> 03:24.087
the rest of it. Now, how do you relate to the, what is 
our big picture of publicity promotion? What do

03:35.340 --> 03:35.922
you do? Tell me, what do you do to make the press, I 
mean, let's say the conceptual program of the

03:35.942 --> 03:41.637
United States press? Well, whenever the editors 
are getting in new manuscripts and looking at

03:41.971 --> 03:56.053
them, frequently they'll do a pre-contract 
circulation. And at that point, Gail passes it to

03:56.073 --> 04:08.653
the people in the marketing department, and I look 
at it and I try to give an opinion as to whether it's

03:56.073 --> 04:08.653
going to have a scholarly or trade audience. 
especially if it has a trade audience, if there are

04:08.633 --> 04:23.306
special things that we need to do, would need to do 
in advance, like get endorsements, budget extra

04:08.633 --> 04:23.306
money for advance proof, budget extra money for 
photographs.

04:27.270 --> 04:38.100
And then I would also, later on, determine how many 
advance proof were needed and who should get them.

04:42.485 --> 04:43.448
We should get them. And I've developed the review 
list and I write them as releases. And I contact,

04:50.483 --> 05:03.982
you know, certain

04:50.483 --> 05:03.982
individuals.

05:04.002 --> 05:04.263
Yeah.

05:07.407 --> 05:14.497
And that, of course, is .

05:14.517 --> 05:16.760
Yeah, it just depends on . Yeah, and it's always, it 
becomes touchy

05:23.947 --> 05:35.224
say if it's a book that is really popular and a lot of 
people want it, we'll just get hordes of requests

05:23.947 --> 05:35.224
come in and you have to winnow through them and 
decide. Okay, how do they know to request that

05:35.244 --> 05:36.125
book? Well, we send, when we send out our seasonal 
catalog, I have a media database and I send it out to

05:36.145 --> 05:46.361
people. Okay, so that catalog is going to that, you 
know, those people in the 90s? Yeah, they'll get

05:50.527 --> 05:51.188
through that. Yeah. And all of this, though,

05:52.330 --> 06:17.038
maybe I'd want to emphasize that even the reason 
that I shifted from editorial to marketing is

05:52.330 --> 06:17.038
because I like copywriting a great deal. 
Copywriting is so completely

06:17.474 --> 06:25.727
different from being a writer because it's just 
wordsmithing. It's very technical, but it's the

06:25.747 --> 06:32.036
one skill I have that I have very high confidence 
in. So I write all the new books and add copy and

06:32.878 --> 06:40.049
sometimes I try to come up with new titles for the 
books. Write little invitations and little

06:40.950 --> 06:46.198
headlines for the ads. The president's giving a 
copy of one of our books to the graduation speaker.

06:55.574 --> 06:56.656
He doesn't have a sentence to say with it. They call 
us, and I can't think of a sentence for it. Yeah,

06:59.219 --> 07:01.202
you're the writer. You're the person who goes 
through it. Yeah, and we do a little season-long

07:02.784 --> 07:15.763
newsletter also

07:02.784 --> 07:15.763
that I'm the untitled editor of the newsletter, 
which I pretty much...

07:20.789 --> 07:30.931
Now, were there any significant changes

07:20.789 --> 07:30.931
in organization ? None that affected me. OK. 
That's all. How about with ? The main one that I

07:39.622 --> 07:51.773
vocally pushed for the gala was that Marianne had 
moved over into the design and production area.

07:51.793 --> 07:57.018
And so I was going to be taking over the advertising 
planning. And at that point, I said, acquiring

07:57.038 --> 08:08.548
these reissues is so

08:08.917 --> 08:15.305
Acquiring the reissue, it's so time consuming to 
try to do it right. It's always a struggle to get it

08:15.325 --> 08:18.810
under the wire. And since it's so completely 
different than marketing, it seems like it's more

08:18.830 --> 08:27.320
suitable to have it back in editorial. And at the 
time, there was new staff members over there that

08:27.420 --> 08:34.249
seemed interested in doing it. suggested that 
gail asked tom to put that back in that

08:35.613 --> 09:01.080
tutorial

08:35.613 --> 09:01.080
yeah someone's already brought that up to me

09:02.056 --> 09:14.774
Did you see any change in the pace of activity, 
production level, individual style, or anything

09:02.056 --> 09:14.774
like that? Well, I would say there was kind of a big 
difference. When Mary came here, she seemed

09:19.180 --> 09:27.191
interested in having everyone work together as a 
team. And whenever a meeting was held, everyone

09:27.211 --> 09:31.978
attended the meeting. means

09:32.785 --> 09:40.052
can be time-consuming, and most of it had very 
little to do with what I was doing. So it was

09:40.553 --> 10:00.272
somewhat of a relief to me that when Tom came 
aboard, he seemed to have a much more hierarchical

09:40.553 --> 10:00.272
style and would deal directly with the department 
heads who would take information to their staff,

09:40.553 --> 10:00.272
and so we didn't have to attend so many meetings 
anymore. But she didn't have an appointment with

10:00.292 --> 10:01.213
her? She couldn't. Well, and she also, I mean, it 
was, I think, you know, everyone was kind of

10:02.637 --> 10:12.453
horrified at the prospect that she made us go on to 
that retreat in the woods. Yeah. Just, I guess, our

10:13.314 --> 10:15.758
feelings and all that. Yeah. What she had, you 
know. I mean, it's all right, because there's lots

10:19.985 --> 10:33.163
of traditional friction, I'm sure, every press 
that crops up between departments. And the one

10:33.263 --> 10:40.272
that marketing always remembers is that people 
from other departments say that marketing always

10:40.572 --> 10:45.377
gets to go to these fun parties and to go places out 
of town. The problem with that is that part of

10:46.238 --> 11:06.900
attending the party or attending the out-of-town 
exhibit is hauling many tons of equipment and

10:46.238 --> 11:06.900
books and equipment through the hotel laundry and 
kitchen and up the great elevator with the staff

10:46.238 --> 11:06.900
who can't speak English and can't tell you where to 
go or what floor to get off on. So that type of stuff

11:07.741 --> 11:19.559
is hard work.

11:20.981 --> 11:33.360
Do you see, what direction do

11:20.981 --> 11:33.360
you see the, I don't know, if you think, in your 
experience at Texas A&M, What is that? What are the

11:39.365 --> 11:56.929
strengths

11:39.365 --> 11:56.929
and

11:39.365 --> 11:56.929
weaknesses of this press? Where can we go? How are 
we going? Well, that's a big question. Well, it

12:00.695 --> 12:02.537
relates to the reception that

12:06.162 --> 12:09.945
Mrs.

12:06.162 --> 12:09.945
Ford, right? First time this month. Look

12:11.907 --> 12:15.731
at that. To the reception

12:16.932 --> 12:31.365
at the back of

12:16.932 --> 12:31.365
the Gimbel, I've got all kinds of redoubts. 
Basically, the one redoubt is, how do we know what

12:31.385 --> 12:32.626
to do here? What did the election trust do for you in 
the first place?

12:37.094 --> 12:45.645
Well, this, of course, is the research 
institution. And I assume that means that the

12:45.666 --> 12:57.682
faculty are going to be judged for tenure on the 
basis

12:45.666 --> 12:57.682
of what they produce, depending on what 
department they're in, of course. But we're here

12:57.702 --> 13:03.169
to, as our traditional mission is, to disseminate 
scholarship. be their their connection to the

13:03.773 --> 13:31.873
world one of the main things i think that 
especially in marketing that if we have to provide

13:03.773 --> 13:31.873
a little a little dose of reality because a lot of 
books that come in whose authors work very hard on

13:03.773 --> 13:31.873
it and it's very enthusiastic and believes that 
everyone wants to buy a copy and read it and the very

13:03.773 --> 13:31.873
sad thing is that that most people do not read books 
even that they borrow from the library and they

13:33.035 --> 13:58.738
certainly do not buy books and i'm talking about 
the general public so when so we we're in a position

13:33.035 --> 13:58.738
to say this is very good work that you've done you 
know it will make a tremendous contribution to

13:33.035 --> 13:58.738
scholarship but the interested audience is not 
large. You're doing a great service to a select

14:03.800 --> 14:14.274
group of

14:03.800 --> 14:14.274
people. And it's our job to be able to identify when 
there is going to be a larger group of people that's

14:14.455 --> 14:25.249
both interested and that is reachable. Because 
the key is in reaching them. If there's no direct

14:33.205 --> 14:52.871
mail list for the identified

14:33.205 --> 14:52.871
audience, you're not going to be able to reach them 
with any surety. Do you see, from your perspective

14:52.891 --> 14:55.675
now, independent marketing, what kind of books 
What

14:56.228 --> 15:06.658
kind

14:56.228 --> 15:06.658
of books do you do best? I mean, what discipline?

15:13.024 --> 15:13.124
Yeah. Character. Yes. What are our good books?

15:23.373 --> 15:23.713
Successful books. Definitely. I admire you. 
Thank you. I mean,

15:26.722 --> 15:37.744
I personally, I gave success by, you know, what 
kind of reviews it gets. Some books get almost no

15:41.120 --> 15:50.033
reviews, and some books get a smattering of sort of 
positive and sort of negative reviews. And so to

15:50.053 --> 16:02.753
me, a successful book is one that wins a lot of 
awards, gets the vast majority of reviews are very

15:50.053 --> 16:02.753
good, and might not necessarily sell very many 
copies. But the awards and the reviews and what the

16:02.733 --> 16:14.501
author does after that was also really fun. 
Because we had one author that... published a book

16:17.515 --> 16:19.558
with us. It probably would have a limited 
audience, but it got some really nice reviews in

16:19.578 --> 16:25.568
some prominent places. And as a result of that, two 
other publishing companies or one other

16:25.708 --> 16:37.127
publishing company called his author and said, 
we're going to contract you to do another book for

16:25.708 --> 16:37.127
us. That's success. That's success. It really is. 
Or if the author gets a commercial house contract

16:41.665 --> 16:48.366
after publishing this. It's too bad we wouldn't be 
publishing ourselves, but that shows that the

16:48.768 --> 16:54.034
first book was a success. Well, you know, our 
university is a nation of publishers,

16:54.074 --> 17:10.511
in a

16:54.074 --> 17:10.511
way. Now, in terms of the publishing business, the 
market's getting tougher. Oh, absolutely.

17:31.041 --> 17:31.782
Absolutely. And part of it is I remember Gail and I 
talking about some project that I don't remember

17:34.938 --> 17:47.179
at one time, and we were talking about its 
audience, and I said, well, this seems like a book

17:34.938 --> 17:47.179
mostly for an older audience. And she said, well, 
if you go through our individual customer

17:47.199 --> 17:55.773
records, most of them are considerably older 
people. And when I look at young people around

17:55.793 --> 18:00.962
them, And even people who are almost as old as I am 
who tell me, and these are people with college

18:01.516 --> 18:19.421
educations who are in graduate school or have 
graduate degrees, and they say,

18:01.516 --> 18:19.421
I don't read. I never buy books, and I never read. 
And it tells me that anyone who Because any younger

18:32.245 --> 18:36.473
than I am is not going to be oriented toward books at 
all. They're just oriented toward, you know, TVs

18:36.573 --> 18:40.360
and computers. And when we get our student 
interns, you know, they're even here working, you

18:40.380 --> 18:47.714
know, expressing their interest in working in the 
publishing house. We get them back in the

18:47.734 --> 18:51.722
marketing department, and they just want to work 
on the website. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED

18:52.850 --> 19:01.348
IN A SMALL, YOU KNOW, ACCUMULATION OF TASKS THAT 
WILL LEAD TO SOME KIND OF SUCCESS. THEY REALLY ONLY

19:01.368 --> 19:08.884
SEEM TO GET EXCITED ABOUT THAT WHEN THEY

19:01.368 --> 19:08.884
GET READY.

19:14.129 --> 19:22.301
So that means that the future is going to be more 
covering than the present is. Well, I don't have a

19:22.321 --> 19:29.412
reputation as being a bright, shiny optimist. 
Yeah, I don't see it getting any bigger. I really

19:35.961 --> 19:36.963
have to put it in a different way. Maybe I'll have to 
abandon it for a while. Well, yeah, I'm not saying

19:39.205 --> 19:44.717
it never does. The

19:45.238 --> 19:52.675
economics of it get harder and harder and harder. 
Well, I should get more.

20:00.546 --> 20:03.870
Well, that's what I . Part of it is external. I think 
you're being looked

20:09.156 --> 20:16.905
at.

20:16.925 --> 20:17.205
You had money. We had money. And why not privatize 
it? That doesn't work. You have the rights. No,

20:22.186 --> 20:33.941
they're quite, I think, I know I've heard of which 
one of the big, bigger viewers

20:22.186 --> 20:33.941
of the Press is it? Maybe California was, 
California has lost, I think, a lot of, you know, a

20:33.961 --> 20:40.369
lot of journals. Yeah. Who's that business based? 
Well, I know this. The state of California, you

20:45.054 --> 20:48.058
know, just... You know, slashed everyone so 
severely.

20:58.443 --> 21:12.578
I can't imagine

20:58.443 --> 21:12.578
the president would have escaped that. And I 
didn't know I was going to be in California, but the

21:12.598 --> 21:14.861
7th and 8th, they got 100 people. They said, coming 
down here, they're going to get kind of shocked. It

21:16.222 --> 21:17.143
was a little dingy, but a very small place. They 
were probably close to 100 people.

21:21.704 --> 21:47.794
I

21:21.704 --> 21:47.794
really,

21:21.704 --> 21:47.794
at this point,

21:21.704 --> 21:47.794
have no opinion about that. I just use what we have 
at the time. It was easier to have an opinion like

21:51.775 --> 21:58.442
that in the editorial rather than some types of 
projects. Well, I couldn't pick it, you know,

21:58.462 --> 22:05.149
because I was only in a copy of its new section of it. 
Some projects were of more interest or somehow

22:05.169 --> 22:15.600
more gratifying, or some authors were easier to 
over-direct than others. But there are still

22:15.620 --> 22:20.905
certain projects that produce a great sense of 
satisfaction.

22:24.074 --> 22:28.420
And I suppose each person

22:24.074 --> 22:28.420
has a . Oh, yeah, depending on what it is. Lloyd 
Lyman used to tell me I was only interested in

22:31.805 --> 22:40.476
pointy-headed British literary stuff. But in 
actual fact, in all the years I've worked here,

22:45.843 --> 22:54.536
involved I got in any project was the East of Chosin 
book, which was the Korean War Frontlines. And

22:54.556 --> 23:04.510
that one, you know, and I even, you know, had 
contact with that after I moved into marketing

22:54.556 --> 23:04.510
because frequently when people write in or call in 
looking for the author, and it gets fed back to the

23:05.722 --> 23:13.471
publicity area. And I would have to say that that 
one book produced more, quote, fan mail or calls

23:13.491 --> 23:22.281
and letters than almost all the others combined. 
You know, I even had a minister called one day and

23:24.103 --> 23:33.754
just wanted to read me something from the magazine 
that had to do, that mentioned that book. And the

23:34.426 --> 23:46.867
minister just talked on and on about, you

23:34.426 --> 23:46.867
know, the profound meaning it had for these 
people. And actually, I think, you know, a lot of

23:46.887 --> 23:54.620
that is timing and timing is not something you 
necessarily like. Oh, no.

24:01.038 --> 24:08.491
Well, I

24:01.038 --> 24:08.491
don't know.

24:14.141 --> 24:18.709
I wasn't here for the entire experience of it 
because The beginning of it apparently had this

24:19.634 --> 24:27.223
special quality. Yeah, yeah. Whereas now it's 
more,

24:29.546 --> 24:48.468
you know, it's just kind of a basic process.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.249
Well, anyway, thank you. Okay. Okay. Did Linda 
Collins tell you the story about the post office

24:51.730 --> 24:55.335
box? I told her to do that. No, no, tell me. There was 
some kind of confusion last week

25:00.842 --> 25:07.110
about that. The press has always had the address of 
4C, the call station, and the press. The woman just

25:14.242 --> 25:19.027
said, Tom asked her to call the post office and ask 
them. And it turned out that there is no such thing

25:19.248 --> 25:27.377
as floor C. And then it turns out that there never 
has been. But that when Frank Wardlaw, when

25:27.397 --> 25:39.670
arrangements were being made to start the press, 
and Frank Wardlaw would come, he said, I need a

25:27.397 --> 25:39.670
place to get mail. And the university was going to 
set him up in the post office box for floor C. But

25:44.060 --> 26:05.474
then, apparently, before he even got here, after 
he'd already commissioned Tom Lee to make that

25:44.060 --> 26:05.474
letterhead with the address in it, the university 
called and said something about, well, you're not

25:44.060 --> 26:05.474
going to have the post office vouchers, and you're 
stuck with this man. And he supposedly said, well,

26:05.494 --> 26:11.063
I've already had his artwork commissioned. And I 
found this out on Friday, last Friday, that there

26:11.718 --> 26:22.272
never was a drawer scene. And so I'm assuming, you 
know, if Frank Wardlaw, and he's so legendary, I

26:22.732 --> 26:36.730
just had the idea, well, Frank Wardlaw had the 
drawer scene, and since it was his, you can't

26:22.732 --> 26:36.730
partner with him. Although we have parted with it 
now. Yeah, we deleted it off of our, we were working

26:39.698 --> 26:43.285
on our sale catalog. So they said, well, you know, 
you really don't need to use your seed. In fact,

26:47.252 --> 26:54.966
it confuses the campus mail or something. I guess 
they look for it over there. I don't know.

27:04.564 --> 27:09.371
I guess Linda knows the full story of that. Linda or 
Gail at one or the other. I thought it was so funny

27:12.495 --> 27:21.708
that...

27:21.728 --> 27:22.248
Very good. I appreciate your time. Okay. And I 
assume you're... I

27:27.706 --> 27:37.513
just do what I'm .
