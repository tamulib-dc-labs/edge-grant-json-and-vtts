00:01.246 --> 00:03.128
Let me just correct one thing. I was talking about 
the preferred growth sketch. The preferred

00:06.732 --> 00:24.132
growth sketch was what the planning department 
came up with in November of 1976, and what the city

00:06.732 --> 00:24.132
council approved in March of 1977 was entitled the 
San Antonio

00:28.938 --> 00:31.462
the San Antonio growth sketch. And that was the 
thing that was officially approved by city

00:32.022 --> 00:34.686
council.

00:37.851 --> 00:57.679
So what we're talking about is the whole growth 
study

00:37.851 --> 00:57.679
project that was initiated during

00:37.851 --> 00:57.679
Cipriano Guerra's tenure as director of 
planning. It's important also to realize that

00:58.418 --> 01:14.036
several very significant things happened during 
this period of time which caused San Antonio's

00:58.418 --> 01:14.036
more recent planning activities to happen. The 
first of which is that the council that was elected

01:15.277 --> 01:28.172
in 1975,

01:15.277 --> 01:28.172
in April of 1975, took office on the 1st of May, 
1975,

01:28.490 --> 01:39.365
was the council for the first time that the Good 
Government League did not dominate. There were

01:40.487 --> 01:46.856
only three of the nine council members were Good 
Government League people. The mayor, Mayor

01:47.317 --> 01:53.265
Cockrell, Henry Cisneros, who was elected for the 
first time in 1975, and Phil Pendous were the three

01:53.600 --> 01:56.483
council members. The rest were members of the 
independent team. The significant thing about

01:59.907 --> 02:07.516
that is that one of the members of the independent 
team was a man by the name of Glenn Hartman. And

02:07.536 --> 02:19.009
Hartman was a person who came out of civil service 
working for the Air Force and was basically a

02:07.536 --> 02:19.009
strategic planner. He wasn't a land planner or a 
city planner, He was probably as much as anyone

02:23.283 --> 02:34.554
responsible for getting the city of San Antonio to 
start thinking seriously about a plan again. What

02:35.014 --> 02:47.747
Hartman did was he read Article 9 of the city 
charter and asked the question, why doesn't the

02:35.014 --> 02:47.747
city of San Antonio have a plan when the charter 
says thou shall have a plan? And he worked with a

02:51.447 --> 03:07.308
retired colonel by the name of Bill Dodds, 
D-O-D-D-S, to research what were the reasons,

02:51.447 --> 03:07.308
particularly the structural reasons, which kept 
the city of San Antonio from developing a plan.

03:07.809 --> 03:09.591
Everybody recognized we didn't have a plan. 
Everybody recognized that the Charter said you

03:09.892 --> 03:12.455
would have one. The question was why we didn't. It 
appears from the chronology of planning and

03:18.093 --> 03:31.428
planters in San Antonio so far that San Antonio 
could be looked at as a graveyard for planters.

03:31.448 --> 03:32.409
You have to explain. I don't understand what you 
mean. Well, their tenure was very short. And they

03:35.793 --> 03:41.019
were usually run out of town or run out of the state. 
Well, that's not true. That only happened.

03:47.573 --> 03:55.162
That happened, the only one that was kind of run off 
because of a specific planning activity was

03:47.573 --> 03:55.162
Charles Stromberg. Davis, it was a, well, Davis 
was a combination, no, Davis, I think, was a

03:55.883 --> 04:05.575
combination of his personality and planning. 
And, you know, you know Ed as well as I do, and he had a

04:05.595 --> 04:11.242
very strong personality. Ed Davis resigned. He 
wasn't fired. And he resigned because of some

04:17.662 --> 04:21.626
things that he strongly believed in. So I don't 
think it's fair to characterize San Antonio as a

04:21.646 --> 04:27.772
graveyard for planning. Well, I think there is a 
certain amount of truth in it, regardless of...

04:27.872 --> 04:33.939
Well, I just disagree totally with that. Why do you 
disagree? I know I can't.

04:40.806 --> 04:46.892
You know, I think that there were some people 
that... Well, first of all, let me back up and say

04:47.176 --> 04:50.420
First of all, I don't think the community knew what 
planning was. And the community didn't really

04:51.021 --> 04:54.786
think that the city should be involved in 
planning. And there were some people that were

04:55.247 --> 05:04.880
strongly opposed to city staff planners doing any 
planning. But I don't think that's unlike many

05:06.623 --> 05:16.997
other cities go through a period of time where 
people don't appreciate or understand the value

05:17.838 --> 05:19.280
of planning. And I think that was true in San 
Antonio during that period of planning. It did

05:24.326 --> 05:37.162
have the result after Davis left and after 
Stromberg was fired of many of those people that

05:24.326 --> 05:37.162
Davis attracted to the planning department got 
disillusioned and left. And they're spread all

05:37.462 --> 05:41.467
across the country right now. And that's very 
unfortunate because Davis was able to, as I said,

05:42.188 --> 05:46.714
attract Well, this is part of why I mentioned that 
characterization. Well, but I still don't like

05:53.310 --> 05:59.918
the statement that it was a graveyard. Well, I'm 
sure you don't like it. Okay, well, let's put a mush

06:04.024 --> 06:05.585
on. Okay, then, the other point I was going to make 
about these factors that contributed to the

06:05.986 --> 06:17.140
current, to the late 1970s planning effort is that 
One of the things that came out of the Hartman-Dodd

06:17.845 --> 06:34.945
study was the fact that the then Planning and 
Zoning Commission really was spending all of its

06:17.845 --> 06:34.945
time hearing zoning cases and approving 
subdivision plots and really had no time to do

06:17.845 --> 06:34.945
planning. So again, for the second time, the city 
council in March of 1976 officially split the

06:44.221 --> 06:48.285
Planning and Zoning Commission in two 
commissions. The Zoning Commission, which was

06:48.906 --> 07:04.361
charged with all the zoning, and the Planning 
Commission, which was specifically charged with

06:48.906 --> 07:04.361
engaging in an active effort to come up with a plan 
for the city of San Antonio. And to this day, we

07:04.841 --> 07:09.226
still have two commissions in San Antonio. Did 
Hartman Stick around to make sure that the

07:11.997 --> 07:17.325
Planning Commission would attend to its charge. 
Yes. Hartman was around. He was first elected in

07:20.409 --> 07:37.153
1975,

07:20.409 --> 07:37.153
was re-elected in 77, and

07:20.409 --> 07:37.153
may have even been, let's see, 79. No, he was out by 
79. But what he did, he was around for four years,

07:39.301 --> 07:43.687
almost four years, three and a half years. And not 
only did he keep his interest in planning and be

07:44.689 --> 08:00.391
very supportive, but also he was responsible for 
getting Bill Dodds on the planning commission. In

08:00.411 --> 08:06.760
other words, it was an attempt to not only create a 
planning commission, but to make sure that at

08:07.145 --> 08:14.213
least a significant number of its members were 
people that had some appreciation for plant. When

08:14.314 --> 08:32.275
we discussed earlier the split of the commission 
in the 61 to 63 period, I don't think that there were

08:14.314 --> 08:32.275
people on the commission during that period of 
time that really understood what it was to, what

08:14.314 --> 08:32.275
effort it would take to do a plan and what role the 
commission had to play. I think that was different

08:36.429 --> 08:39.633
by 1976. I had met Hartman at one of the short 
courses that the AIP was giving during those days.

08:51.227 --> 09:01.941
And I was very impressed with Hartman and with his 
knowledge of comprehensive planning and the need

08:51.227 --> 09:01.941
for it in San Antonio. energy and commitment to the 
idea that San Antonio was going to have

09:02.478 --> 09:09.449
comprehensive planning. Yeah, I think, again, if 
this project gets to the point where he's a person

09:09.469 --> 09:17.441
that should be talked to, Glenn has kind of changed 
a lot. He's very bitter about government in San

09:17.461 --> 09:20.847
Antonio. He's moved from San Antonio. He now lives 
in Austin. And he's head of some state agency

09:23.230 --> 09:29.380
that's in charge with all state buildings. but he 
is definitely someone that probably should be

09:29.984 --> 09:52.674
talked to because he did play kind of a critical 
role in that 1975 through 77 period when there was a

09:29.984 --> 09:52.674
major effort to get the city to do a plan that the 
charter had called for all along.

09:55.879 --> 09:57.561
And the other thing that happened The third thing, 
we were just talking about some of the major things

09:57.828 --> 10:14.865
that are occurring here, was that in January of 
1977, there was only the second major change in the

09:57.828 --> 10:14.865
charter since 1951. And that change was to expand 
the number of city council members from 9 to 11 and

10:15.446 --> 10:26.957
to elect the council members by district rather 
than at large. So, all of them? All of them. Well,

10:31.035 --> 10:32.116
except for the mayor. The mayor runs citywide, but 
all ten council

10:32.357 --> 10:41.387
persons other than the mayor run from geographic 
districts. So, on May 1st, 1977, we had basically a

10:41.988 --> 10:50.918
very different council in San Antonio. We had a 
council made up of people that represented

10:53.380 --> 10:55.742
geographic areas. Many of those people were also 
people that were serving for the first time, many

10:56.283 --> 11:18.345
of whom had defeated incumbents

10:56.283 --> 11:18.345
that had been on the previous council and just had a 
whole different view of what San Antonio should be

10:56.283 --> 11:18.345
doing with respect to its growth and development. 
So that was another major effect that an

11:22.591 --> 11:35.189
environmental effect that

11:22.591 --> 11:35.189
had a major impact on San Antonio's effort in the 
late 1970s to develop the plan. Guerra stepped

11:37.032 --> 11:40.557
down. Well, basically what happened actually is 
in addition to the split of the Planning and Zoning

11:40.737 --> 11:50.792
Commission, the Planning Department was 
reconstituted Sometime also in 1976 and

11:51.768 --> 12:20.222
community

11:51.768 --> 12:20.222
development was split off and again there was a 
department of planning per se and in

11:51.768 --> 12:20.222
June of 1976 Robert Hunter became director of 
planning and served for about a four year period of

11:51.768 --> 12:20.222
time. And during his tenure as director of 
planning, most of the big battles and

12:21.080 --> 12:32.711
controversies about the plan and what it should be 
occurred. And he departed, he resigned, I guess it

12:33.192 --> 12:50.108
was sometime in 1980, I don't recall when,

12:33.192 --> 12:50.108
under some pressure to do so. I have firsthand 
knowledge of that. Bob was in architecture at A&M.

13:00.232 --> 13:00.492
Yes. And has his degree in architecture. Yes. And I 
think that says a lot about his approach to

13:04.837 --> 13:20.753
planning, that he was very visually oriented and 
not very development process oriented, and

13:04.837 --> 13:20.753
probably didn't have a very good understanding of 
the role. of the development community and how it

13:21.458 --> 13:29.030
can interface with public agencies. And I think 
that he probably had to learn that. Well, let me

13:32.916 --> 13:34.158
just say that. Two things in response. One is that 
I'm not necessarily sure it was just his

13:37.283 --> 13:44.434
architectural training. Because I can name an 
architect that I know who probably has as much

13:49.471 --> 13:56.901
insight in planning as anyone who's gone through 
professional planning and had experience. I

13:57.442 --> 13:58.583
think we all can do that. But I think part of the 
problem with Bob is that his whole orientation was

13:59.024 --> 14:06.874
public agency. He had come to the planning 
department from the San Antonio Development

14:06.995 --> 14:16.187
Agency as their planning manager, and his He was 
dealing with project planning and basically

14:17.129 --> 14:22.595
public sector planning there. So he really had not 
worked a great deal with the private sector in

14:22.655 --> 14:34.208
terms of development. So it probably was less his 
education and more his own personal feelings and

14:34.228 --> 14:46.782
his previous experiences.

14:47.943 --> 15:14.035
and there was all kinds of politics involved in 
that also, but be that as it may, he in 76 became

14:47.943 --> 15:14.035
director of planning and one of his first tasks was 
the revival and getting something done about the

14:47.943 --> 15:14.035
growth sketch itself and as I said, that occurred 
in March of 77 with the council approving the San

15:14.673 --> 15:20.279
Antonio grill sketch. So basically, by March of 
77, or just before the first new city council took

15:20.319 --> 15:39.381
office on May 1, new meaning the expanded, elected 
by district city council, then there was a buy-off

15:39.918 --> 15:50.113
on the basic policies for developing a plan and a 
charge to develop a plan itself. And that's where

15:50.414 --> 15:57.044
we were in the spring of 1977 and really the next 
three or four years. What do you mean by a buy-off?

15:58.726 --> 16:02.432
Well, I mean that the council had bought off on some 
policies as embodied in the San Antonio growth

16:02.817 --> 16:24.218
sketch, that would serve as a basis for the 
planners and the planning commission to come up

16:02.817 --> 16:24.218
with a plan and had given, on a number of occasions, 
had given the charge to let's get a plan done. And

16:24.772 --> 16:54.576
then as I said, then the Hunter era, a four-year 
period of time was a period of time during which

16:24.772 --> 16:54.576
there was, one might say, all hell broke loose in 
terms of

16:24.772 --> 16:54.576
major efforts to develop a plan and a lot of 
controversy about what the role of planning in San

16:24.772 --> 16:54.576
Antonio should be and how the community should 
grow over a period of time. You want

16:55.552 --> 17:01.920
to ask a question, or what? No, we were going on 
about Hunter, and then he was under some pressure

17:02.480 --> 17:13.634
to leave, and then after Hunter, what happened? 
Oh, well, wait a minute. You can't skip over

17:14.755 --> 17:16.317
Hunter. I'm

17:16.517 --> 17:21.203
not skipping over anybody. Well, let me... 
After... After the San Antonio growth sketch had

17:25.825 --> 17:47.648
been approved in

17:25.825 --> 17:47.648
March of 1977, the effort then was how do we go from 
this to a plan to meet the requirements of the

17:25.825 --> 17:47.648
charter and to meet the desires of the then city 
council. So that was largely the responsibility

17:48.353 --> 18:04.426
of the Planning Commission, which was separate at 
that time and chaired by Margaret Lexner,

17:48.353 --> 18:04.426
L-E-C-Z-N-A-R, and the Planning Department, 
which at that time was headed by Bob Hunter.

18:08.910 --> 18:14.775
Kind of one of the first things that were done was to 
look at how one might organize the final product.

18:14.795 --> 18:18.158
In other words, what would be contained a master 
plan itself. And as I said, one of the problems that

18:21.185 --> 18:38.723
San Antonio had is that Article 9 of the Charter, 
although saying thou shalt have a plan and

18:21.185 --> 18:38.723
specifying in some detail the legal effect of the 
plan, didn't really give much guidance as to what a

18:21.185 --> 18:38.723
plan should be. So the planning department, in 
conjunction with the commission, but largely the

18:39.344 --> 18:45.630
staff of the planning department, came up with an 
outline for a city plan which had five chapters.

18:51.117 --> 19:15.786
And so they viewed it as a document which would 
contain five chapters, and chapter one being an

18:51.117 --> 19:15.786
introduction, chapter two being a summary, 
chapter three being what they were calling the

18:51.117 --> 19:15.786
plan basis, chapter four being the goals, 
objectives, and policies of the plan, and then

18:51.117 --> 19:15.786
chapter five dealing with implementation. What 
they... Too bad they hadn't read Ken's book. Well,

19:19.533 --> 19:21.155
that would have only confused them. Oh, no. So 
the... Now, the idea was this. The idea was to focus

19:27.241 --> 19:31.205
the effort on Chapter 4. Chapter 4 being the goals, 
the objectives, and the policies of the plan

19:32.065 --> 19:37.070
itself. And in order to do that, it was necessary to 
develop... a statement of goals. And so what

19:47.464 --> 19:56.900
happened in this period of time, and most of this 
effort was occurring from mid-1977. Well,

19:57.121 --> 20:08.942
actually, the big effort on Chapter 4 was an effort 
that took place during calendar year 1978.

20:09.192 --> 20:20.791
And the idea was to deal with a set of goals and then 
to articulate those goals into objectives and

20:09.192 --> 20:20.791
further specify those objectives into a set of 
policies. And so the

20:21.272 --> 20:32.871
planning department staff working with the 
commission came up with a number of different

20:21.272 --> 20:32.871
areas. And I needn't go into all this, but the 
result was that in September of 1978, a draft of

20:33.695 --> 20:50.016
Chapter 4 was presented by the Planning 
Department staff to the Planning Commission. And

20:51.616 --> 20:56.303
it was a very detailed document. It contained 60 or 
so pages of lots of statements. Basically, it was

21:03.275 --> 21:10.486
about 60 pages of goals, objectives, and policies 
dealing with major areas. You deal with

21:10.506 --> 21:17.337
neighborhoods and conservation and all 
different kinds of things. Well, that document,

21:18.211 --> 21:29.564
Chapter 4,

21:18.211 --> 21:29.564
really created a lot of controversy for a lot of 
different reasons. One reason was that many

21:31.778 --> 21:40.591
people, and after you read 60 pages of goals and 
objectives and policies, you're sure to find some

21:31.778 --> 21:40.591
that you don't like. So most people just took 
exception to the detail and to a lot of the

21:40.611 --> 21:48.542
substantive statements in those goals. In 
addition...

21:52.508 --> 21:58.697
In addition, a lot of people felt that, well, if 
we're dealing with Chapter 4, where are the other

21:59.167 --> 22:11.203
chapters, particularly where is chapter three 
which was entitled the plan basis and was to be all

21:59.167 --> 22:11.203
the substantiating information that would set 
the stage for chapter four. So people were saying

22:11.503 --> 22:13.686
well this is out of context.

22:16.850 --> 22:28.566
The commission felt strongly after dealing with 
this for several months and it was just an

22:16.850 --> 22:28.566
incredible amount of time going through these 
things, all kinds of public hearings all kinds of

22:28.883 --> 22:30.525
dealing with citizens. And finally, in March of 
1979, the commission said, well, why don't we just

22:31.106 --> 22:46.604
pass it on to city council and let them tell us, let 
them provide us with some direction. And

22:46.624 --> 22:50.529
essentially that's what the commission did. It 
sent the whole thing to city council. City council

22:53.432 --> 22:57.557
rejected it out of hand and said, and provided some 
guidelines for how one might go about developing a

22:58.432 --> 23:10.587
document. And in reaction to that in mid-79, going 
into late 79, the whole idea of thinking about what

23:10.607 --> 23:24.844
the plan would look like got restructured And the 
idea was to come up with, to first deal with a

23:25.904 --> 23:39.920
planned basis, some very general overall goals, 
and the institutional settings and all of that.

23:40.881 --> 23:44.004
And that was accomplished in a relatively short 
period of time. Went back to city council, was

23:44.064 --> 23:55.557
approved sometime in 1980, I don't recall, when 
mid-1980, August of 1980, And then that was the

23:56.195 --> 23:58.459
plan basis. And then from that, we've had a series 
of specific plans, the land use plan, the

23:58.699 --> 24:11.382
transportation plan, and all of those have been 
accomplished.

24:13.906 --> 24:15.829
Different elements of a comprehensive plan. Yes.

24:32.240 --> 24:38.267
So the council has then taken action on all of these 
elements? Well, what's happened since that time,

24:38.527 --> 24:50.301
and again, we've got to get back to some of the 
change in directors, but the basic plan was

24:38.527 --> 24:50.301
approved, I think, in August of 1980. And then 
since then, a number of different elements of the

24:51.022 --> 24:59.091
plan have been approved by the city council. In 
other words, the transportation major

25:01.631 --> 25:13.146
thoroughfare plan was originally approved in 
1978 and has been revised since then. The land use

25:13.807 --> 25:26.344
plan, which was a major effort of the city, was 
approved about two years ago, I think in about

25:13.807 --> 25:26.344
1988.

25:27.978 --> 25:31.241
I think it was 1983 it was approved, okay. And then 
there have been some specific things like the

25:31.602 --> 25:55.668
Parks and Recreation Plan and a number of others 
that are also either functional or geographic

25:31.602 --> 25:55.668
elements of the plan have been approved, all under 
the umbrella of the basic plan as kind of the

25:31.602 --> 25:55.668
departure point. I see. Okay. The plans that you 
mention in the book, I'm going to refer to them as

25:58.420 --> 26:03.547
elements of the comprehensive plan. Well, that's 
what they are. So we can keep our nomenclature

26:05.850 --> 26:17.386
consistent within the book.

26:17.406 --> 26:18.768
I thought we were doing an interview. I guess I'm 
confused. No, go ahead. I just, I

26:21.892 --> 26:26.959
knew it would happen.

26:29.622 --> 26:39.873
I just got a notice here that Joe Esherick has 
achieved emeritus status, having a re-informer

26:29.622 --> 26:39.873
Berkeley. So, all right. The council has taken 
action on these various elements, some of them,

26:45.820 --> 26:51.366
element by element. Do you think that they will be 
moving toward adopting the entire package of

26:53.729 --> 26:59.275
elements? Well, there's no need to. The way the 
process was set up is that they approve the basic

27:01.885 --> 27:13.980
framework first, and then the elements are 
approved as they're finished. So they

27:14.000 --> 27:18.065
automatically become part of the overall 
document. They have approved the framework. Yes,

27:19.727 --> 27:24.573
that was the basic plan.

27:24.794 --> 27:28.418
That was done in August of 1980. And then let me just 
go back and explain that Hunter left sometime in

27:29.596 --> 27:37.686
79. And I don't recall. I think it was late in 79 or 
very early in 1980. And then Lou Fox, who was an

27:48.560 --> 27:51.244
assistant city. I think we should say about Hunter 
that when Hunter left, he became planning

27:51.264 --> 27:59.434
director in Las Vegas. No. When Hunter left, he 
went to work for the Council of Governments in

28:00.326 --> 28:05.012
Reno. Reno, yes. Yes. And as far as I know, he still 
did. Yes, I think he still did. When he left,

28:11.720 --> 28:18.529
Lou Fox, Louis J. Fox, who's now city manager of San 
Antonio and at that time was assistant city

28:18.609 --> 28:29.303
manager, kind of became an interim planning 
director. while they were looking for a new

28:29.772 --> 28:33.877
planning director. What happened, it's kind of 
interesting that the city, because of some of the

28:34.138 --> 28:54.203
problems in the planning department over

28:34.138 --> 28:54.203
that period of time, 77 to 80, wanted to hire a 
strong administrator. They weren't really

28:54.944 --> 28:56.907
concerned about hiring a planner. They wanted to 
hire a strong administrator. That resulted in

29:00.130 --> 29:17.768
sometime in 1980,

29:00.130 --> 29:17.768
and I don't recall when, late in the year or early 
1981, hiring Roland Lozano as director of

29:00.130 --> 29:17.768
planning. And he is still the director of planning 
in the city of San Antonio.

29:24.795 --> 29:27.117
L-O-Z-A-N-O.

29:30.978 --> 29:38.789
And in the meantime, Houston has hired a new city 
planning director who came from Southern Ohio.

29:38.809 --> 29:41.793
Yes, that was a classmate of mine at school. And he 
is proceeding with a new style of planning for

29:44.136 --> 29:48.042
Houston. Yes, as his education taught him to do.

29:56.814 --> 30:00.900
We'll see what comes of that.

30:03.378 --> 30:05.660
So, where are we now? We're right up to date on 
planning directors. Well, yeah, in terms of

30:07.583 --> 30:11.947
planning directors, we are. What is the style of 
your current planning director? Well, Roland's

30:14.990 --> 30:17.473
more of an administrator. I mean, he was hired 
specifically as an administrator as opposed

30:17.493 --> 30:21.337
to... He is not a planner. He's had no experience 
and no education in planning. He is, and he has been

30:26.203 --> 30:30.347
a... uh i think he's got an mpa and he has been a 
manager of various departments and city

30:30.985 --> 30:58.528
government so he's just in as a manager okay let's 
talk a minute about planning staff who are

30:30.985 --> 30:58.528
professional planters and who have made 
contributions to planning in san antonio either

30:30.985 --> 30:58.528
project planning or comprehensive planning 
aside from the planning directors? You might

31:02.832 --> 31:09.541
start with anyone who's currently on the staff 
that you're aware of. Well, how much detail do you

31:09.561 --> 31:12.926
want? Well, I'm talking about senior planner 
level and that sort of thing. People who are in

31:16.451 --> 31:23.220
charge of various projects or comprehensive 
plans. Well, let me just throw out some names over

31:23.240 --> 31:27.486
the years and... some of these people you might 
want to interview.
