00:07.557 --> 00:20.533
and

00:07.557 --> 00:20.533
I

00:07.557 --> 00:20.533
hope he has a sunny day and a poo-poo day, and I hope 
Brian has a silly day. And when we were on the train,

00:21.414 --> 00:35.192
we cut off Brian's hair, we knocked out Scrooge's 
hair, and we dropped the blood off. And We got in the

00:36.143 --> 00:41.974
train, and we broke everything, and we beat the 
other thing. And I laughed. And we cracked a

00:45.921 --> 00:52.874
microphone, and it had a bull hand in front of a 
microphone, too. And my microphone man, boy, was

00:52.894 --> 00:55.860
he mad. And we met Beyonce.

01:02.452 --> 01:04.435
Grandpa had to put the tape on. And Grandpa had to 
put the tape on in the mask of the universe. And

01:09.783 --> 01:12.888
Brian's being silly around the earth. But the 
radio was being naughty noise. And he watched out

01:18.277 --> 01:23.565
for a tornado. Sure, the greatest one is off. We 
need a boo-woo, we need a boo-woo, we need a

01:27.795 --> 01:30.939
boo-woo. And by switching the light off, we may 
talk to Brian Sabiria. Hi, everyone. Good

01:41.953 --> 01:43.234
morning. Hi, everyone. Have a nice sleep day. When 
we were on the plane, Grandma Bravo was going to

01:47.840 --> 01:54.548
take pictures of us and our penises sticking out. 
Thanks, man. Before we had it, we had a Mr. Logo.

02:06.149 --> 02:07.252
Thanks. And we had a Mr. B here, too. We caught up. 
Can I sit right here? Hi. I'll go, you go, you go, you

02:17.208 --> 02:20.492
go, you go. We have a class. Do it up. Come on, do it. 
I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go.

02:32.187 --> 02:32.427
I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. 
I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go.

02:43.461 --> 02:43.722
I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. Here

02:45.963 --> 02:51.494
we go. Yeah. But I want to tell Grandpa it's time to 
put the tape on. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, he's

02:59.769 --> 03:02.635
excusing. Oh, and I have to put the tape on. Stephen 
dropped it. You can't do that, guys. You can't

03:11.829 --> 03:13.511
touch this thing, okay? We're ready for it. We're 
ready to hear our time.

03:21.480 --> 03:21.581
Yeah. Oh, hello. This is Doc, the hairy horse 
monster. Today, we will talk about...

03:35.930 --> 03:45.082
We got

03:35.930 --> 03:45.082
new clothes on. And...

04:05.579 --> 04:08.883
Brian, I went in on the head. Boom. And I hit his 
knee. But. And he hit me. But. But I don't want to

04:19.597 --> 04:21.560
mess with his house. And every time we take on the 
computer.

04:27.908 --> 04:27.988
But. We hear this girl. What? Rock, rock, rock, 
rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock,

04:30.301 --> 05:00.308
rock, rock,

04:30.301 --> 05:00.308
rock, rock,

04:30.301 --> 05:00.308
rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock,

04:30.301 --> 05:00.308
rock, rock, rock, rock. First thing, this is the 
computer. Uncle Carl knows about it, but I don't.

05:06.620 --> 05:14.811
His students did a little stupid and pee-pee 
today, but I didn't know about him. He's really

05:16.673 --> 05:18.656
confusing about me. Maybe we have a good tape 
going. We're waiting. Yeah, Puma. Grandpa,

05:25.803 --> 05:31.640
we're ready for the tape!

05:34.508 --> 05:38.038
Grandpa, we're ready to hear the tape! Hello 
there.
