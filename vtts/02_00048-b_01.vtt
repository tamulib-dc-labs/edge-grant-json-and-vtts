WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:11.277
What made our class, I think, individually 
different is that we all came from modest

00:02.309 --> 00:11.277
families. We all had a work ethic we had to have to be 
there and get through. And it

00:18.824 --> 00:30.375
brought us closer together.

00:31.148 --> 00:33.150
Back to these student organizations. Was there an 
Aggie band in those days? Oh, yes, we had an Aggie

00:37.715 --> 00:39.016
band. Please describe it and what it meant to the 
campus. Well, the Aggie band has always been

00:42.580 --> 00:45.143
special.

00:47.745 --> 00:50.668
One of my closest friends, General O.R. Simpson, 
was in the Aggie band and came here in the Aggie

00:50.748 --> 00:56.354
band. He was in my graduating class in high school. 
I'd lay out two years and he'd go to sea, but he went

01:01.220 --> 01:06.907
directly to A&M. And he was a great influence on my 
life and one of my dearest friends today, although

01:08.169 --> 01:23.768
I see him seldom because his wife is still quite ill 
and he's become more or less of a cruise, you know. I

01:24.541 --> 01:26.584
saw him not long ago at lunch. He and I became 
friends when he came back to A&M. I remember when he

01:30.489 --> 01:39.500
came, first time I met him, he was the reviewing 
officer and the commissioning speaker. And I

01:40.021 --> 01:45.508
remember that very erect carriage in that pure 
white uniform. Well, I can tell you a story about

01:45.528 --> 01:47.350
him. It'll be of interest. When he graduated in 
1936, I followed him and graduated in 37, about a

01:54.697 --> 02:01.286
year really apart. When he graduated, there was 
only one appointment in the armed services as a

02:01.306 --> 02:09.538
regular commissioner. That was the Marine Corps. 
And he was the number one military graduate, and it

02:11.761 --> 02:16.367
was given to him. And he went to the Marine Corps at 
Quanto, Virginia, And I remember when he was very

02:25.190 --> 02:34.543
much in love with Roger Miller of Bryan, Texas. So 
much so that he just couldn't handle it. He

02:39.430 --> 02:51.687
resigned his commission after a year and came back 
to A&M to make his home and married Roger Miller. Of

02:53.354 --> 02:58.460
course, the war followed very quickly, and he was 
called right back to active duty. And despite

02:59.201 --> 03:08.112
resigning that commission, he went on to become a 
lieutenant general, and we have our field name for

02:59.201 --> 03:08.112
him. But because of that, when I graduated, I was 
the number one military graduate. They had only

03:15.982 --> 03:22.129
one permanent commission to offer anyone in the 
Marine Department. Colonel Converse S. Lewis

03:23.695 --> 03:34.689
called me in and he said, Lieutenant Conway, 
you've been selected for this award. It's the

03:34.709 --> 03:37.613
greatest thing that could happen to you. You're 
the only one.

03:41.998 --> 03:45.082
I said, General Lewis, I can't take it. He was 
astounded. He got up from his desk and said, you

03:50.088 --> 03:53.112
can't do that. it's too important, it's too great. 
I said, well sir, I want a cotton fellowship to

03:56.416 --> 04:04.830
Europe and I'm a cotton, I want to get into cotton 
vendors and this is what I want to do. And I said,

04:05.872 --> 04:14.907
you've got another man that's well qualified and 
more so than I am and I know wants this job and his

04:05.872 --> 04:14.907
name is Harry Shea. Well Harry Shea took the job and 
I did. One of the main reasons I didn't was because

04:21.340 --> 04:27.046
of Harmon's experience and the fact he dropped 
out. Had he stayed in, maybe I would have. I don't

04:29.409 --> 04:30.390
know. You might have been a general. I might have 
been killed going into Vietnam as a major, you

04:31.611 --> 04:36.797
know, too. More likely. Other student groups. The 
band, they performed at what kinds of events?

04:47.789 --> 04:50.672
Well, the band, I guess, Well, the band, we had many 
cool reviews and the band was always the guts, you

04:52.272 --> 05:20.277
might say, to make it and give it the zip and the 
marching music that we, the old Sousa music and

04:52.272 --> 05:20.277
others that we just enjoyed marching to. It just 
added so much to our parades, and I remember one

05:22.681 --> 05:34.451
very distinct parade that was in my mind. I was, as I 
say, I was commander of the Calvary Regiment, and

05:35.352 --> 05:51.186
about that time the armed services were 
recognizing that the Calvary was no longer a

05:35.352 --> 05:51.186
viable military force. because the horse was so 
vulnerable.

05:56.079 --> 06:09.512
So they were shutting down one of the, in Texas, one 
of the really historical great events, the Texas

05:56.079 --> 06:09.512
National Guard Calvary Regiment.

06:22.486 --> 06:40.708
they decided to bring the

06:22.486 --> 06:40.708
flag of the National Guard Regiment to the A&M and 
present it to our cavalry regiment. And there is

06:40.728 --> 06:52.122
Converse S. Lewis with Colonel Thompson, the 
commander at that time of the Calvary National

06:40.728 --> 06:52.122
Guard, and his aid, and there I am accepting the 
flag at that memorial occasion. It was a very

07:00.415 --> 07:06.785
significant occasion, but no one ever gives it a 
thought today, you know. That flag is among some of

07:06.805 --> 07:12.553
our souvenirs, our memos there, souvenirs at A&M. 
Well, let's hope it's still there. It should be

07:15.798 --> 07:16.680
there. Let's see, other student organizations, 
Well, back to the band.

07:26.455 --> 07:29.399
What did you non-band members think about the 
band? Did you all hold it in high regard? Did you

07:31.382 --> 07:33.585
respect and admire the band? Oh, absolutely. All 
of us did. Of course, I never was a musical, never

07:35.668 --> 07:42.198
did play any instruments until my mother played 
the piano. But I admired anyone who would

07:42.719 --> 07:50.070
volunteer their time to All the trick, that sort of 
thing. Plus I didn't have time for it because I was

07:53.899 --> 07:56.641
working for it. Was there singing cadets in those 
days? Yes, we had singing cadets. But it was not

08:02.566 --> 08:06.290
anything like it is today. Let's see, band 
director, who was the band director?

08:14.317 --> 08:14.977
Can't remember. Okay. Yell leaders, what did the 
yell leaders do in those days? They did the same

08:19.447 --> 08:21.409
thing they do today. Old Cecil White was our year 
leader and Herbie Hartung, each class had two as I

08:21.829 --> 08:29.436
recall. Both of them were dear friends of mine. 
Both of them are no longer with us. Herbie was a

08:38.845 --> 08:49.335
little redhead who was a jewel of a man and Cecil had 
a great personality and they were two leaders. did

08:49.906 --> 08:51.988
a great job. I have heard myths and reports about 
secret fraternities. Can you share anything you

08:59.977 --> 09:04.522
heard about whether or not there were ever any 
secret fraternities? I was never aware when I was a

09:04.783 --> 09:13.973
student that there was even secret fraternities 
around except I think my junior, senior year, and

09:14.257 --> 09:30.637
I'm sure I was aware of it because I had one friend,

09:14.257 --> 09:30.637
Eddie Longoria, I remember I heard, but it didn't 
mean anything to me. Because I was familiar with

09:32.239 --> 09:35.043
fraternities. At the University of Georgia where 
my father went, I had some of my closest friends

09:35.063 --> 09:40.770
before I moved to Texas. I always thought I would go 
to the University of Georgia sometime. And when I

09:45.051 --> 09:48.898
was in high school there, a very unusual thing 
happened. I was asked with a few of the other

09:51.343 --> 09:57.154
prominent young men to pledge K.A. Severosa in 
high school as a senior. They're trying to line up

10:02.030 --> 10:04.593
ahead of time, you know. But that was the closest 
thing I ever came to any fraternity. The only

10:09.480 --> 10:13.746
fraternity I ever detected was A&M fraternity, 
and it's the greatest in the world. Summer jobs.

10:16.349 --> 10:20.615
What did you do in the summers while you were an A&M 
undergraduate? Well, I worked all summer in many

10:20.635 --> 10:24.320
varied jobs. I worked for cotton farmers, Rand 
Morgan. I kept books for him where he worked some

10:28.844 --> 10:39.777
40, 50 Mexicans and had a little store there where 
they came in and they lived in little shacks. But

10:40.478 --> 10:46.945
they'd come in and get their groceries and I'd have 
to check out and check them out to them and keep a

10:40.478 --> 10:46.945
record of what they did. Worked there, keep a check 
of their hours. That was one job I had. I worked for a

10:52.852 --> 10:58.699
cotton generator and a cotton seed oil mill one 
summer and I got a job with a freight broker because

10:59.017 --> 11:12.991
I was trying to work for different firms that dealt 
with cotton. And I worked for Wheel Brothers

11:13.011 --> 11:17.335
Cotton Company one summer. I was a reporter for the 
Call of Times and a proofreader for our paper here

11:17.856 --> 11:28.787
for several summers in high school college. But 
the main job I got was with the Ranges Converse

11:31.753 --> 11:47.608
Company as a shipping auto clerk, where I was 
responsible for

11:31.753 --> 11:47.608
shipping cotton all over the world, various 
cotton companies. You were there four years.

11:49.690 --> 11:54.774
About how much of your expenses for going to A&M did 
you earn yourself?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.078
I would say 90%. And what, in round numbers, what 
did a year cost? Do you remember? Well, back in old

12:05.455 --> 12:13.510
days, you know, a student could get by with as 
little as $2,500, probably. So $3,000 overall.

12:17.577 --> 12:23.428
And I'm sure even less. times my buddy Omar must 
have gotten by and would almost have that. Let's

12:32.371 --> 12:40.179
put on tape your, tell them your story about 
helping, you and others helping Omar Smith. Omar

12:40.479 --> 12:50.029
Smith was in my troop, very troop, and he was an 
engaging guy. He was a short We called ourselves

12:51.505 --> 12:59.954
the Dusty Butch because we were the smallest one in 
the troop and right at the end of the lines, we lined

12:51.505 --> 12:59.954
up all in size. And Omar and I became close friends. 
Well, Omar was working his way through school like

13:05.339 --> 13:10.664
I was, except he was working at odd jobs. And at 
times, when the quarterly payment came up for

13:11.285 --> 13:18.272
subsistence, he just couldn't, didn't have the 
money. So he would go in and I'd invite him to come in

13:19.332 --> 13:27.043
and we'd put a mattress on the floor, an extra 
mattress we found. He would sleep in my dormitory

13:27.663 --> 13:34.032
and I would bring him out food under my shirt. I'd 
bring him out rolls, I'd bring him out a sandwich

13:34.052 --> 13:48.512
I'd make up, wrap it in a little napkin and a piece of 
pie, a kush, and others would do the same thing,

13:34.052 --> 13:48.512
bring a little fruit juice. It had a plastic cap on 
it, and so he would go along for two or three weeks or

13:48.847 --> 14:01.158
a month at a time, by the way, until he could save 
enough money to go down and pay his assistant. And

14:01.178 --> 14:06.603
he did that at least three or four times during his 
freshman, sophomore year. And if we hadn't really

14:07.164 --> 14:11.027
do that, he would never have graduated. But what 
happened to Omar? Omar went on to become a very

14:12.849 --> 14:18.634
successful businessman in the Browns. College 
Station area. I think he ended up owning 40 or 50

14:21.670 --> 14:48.908
Dairy Queen stores throughout Central and North 
Texas and volunteered to be the tennis coach and

14:21.670 --> 14:48.908
coached for about 10 years very successfully and 
thank God the school had the forethought to and the

14:21.670 --> 14:48.908
compassion to name the tennis court for Omar 
Smith. I've participated in a memorial to him to

14:49.512 --> 14:59.663
the former Student Association at the time, and 
got several of my classmates to do the same. And we

14:59.703 --> 15:04.068
all loved Omaha. When you were going home to Corpus 
Christi, or going from Corpus Christi to College

15:05.810 --> 15:16.381
Station, how did you normally travel? 
Hitchhiked. describe hitchhiking from Corpus

15:19.533 --> 15:25.340
to, Corpus Christi to College Station? Back in 
those days, it was not like today. People were not

15:27.984 --> 15:35.173
afraid because there were, no one was ever, hardly 
ever attacked. I had uniform and traveled in

15:36.114 --> 15:47.869
uniform wherever I could because people would 
pick up Texas Hikers, they would recognize them

15:36.114 --> 15:47.869
and they wanted to be helpful and I could make 
almost as good time hitchhiking as I could if I rode

15:48.085 --> 15:53.173
the train. In fact, I hitchhiked from, I wanted to 
go visit my grandparents in Georgia, Athens,

15:53.934 --> 16:01.566
Georgia, one Christmas. I hitchhiked over there 
and I made better time than if I'd made on a train.

16:07.916 --> 16:15.848
And I had no real problem with each time I'd make 
friends with a new family or some group. share

16:16.351 --> 16:20.217
whatever they had with me, and it was a great 
adventure. Now, if you were leaving the campus

16:21.419 --> 16:27.548
hitchhiking, where did you go to put out your 
thumb? Was there a certain place? Well, there were

16:28.910 --> 16:33.197
certain places, depending on the way you were 
going. You were going to Houston, you were going to

16:33.437 --> 16:37.043
Austin, which you'd line up. Where were those 
places? You'd respect those in front of you and

16:37.964 --> 16:45.075
wait your turn. A lot of times we'd get out there and 
a man said, well, I can carry four or five. Throw

16:51.023 --> 16:52.365
that bucket four or five. We'd all pile in and go as 
far as he'd take us. Then we'd get out and do the same

16:56.491 --> 16:59.555
thing. If

17:01.077 --> 17:11.130
you were hitchhiking, did you put out the thumb? I 
just raised my hand, you know, and they recognized

17:11.498 --> 17:17.186
what we wanted. We were in uniform, and it was a 
common practice. How many of your outfit buddies

17:20.771 --> 17:25.017
had a car? How common was it for a student to have a 
car then? In my outfit, I think there was only one

17:28.601 --> 17:37.133
car, and the whole cavalry, there might have been 
three. Were there... In my opinion. Did anybody

17:38.735 --> 17:40.678
ever borrow... a buddy's car very much?

17:47.139 --> 18:02.582
I didn't have any buddy that had one except

17:47.139 --> 18:02.582
I never did borrow any cars except I told you the 
case where I borrowed cases and if I was going to

17:47.139 --> 18:02.582
borrow a car I'd borrow his. Let's see, a while ago I 
see a note here, we forgot to talk about P.L. Downs.

18:10.658 --> 18:11.759
Tell me about Pinky. Oh, Pinky. Well, Pinky, as I 
may have mentioned, ever since I graduated from

18:13.521 --> 18:29.158
A&M, my ties to A&M have always been so great 
because they did so much for me that I quickly got

18:13.521 --> 18:29.158
active in association affairs. I made the annual 
association meetings and got acquainted with all

18:32.768 --> 18:35.993
the old timers. And I...

18:36.013 --> 18:42.202
What was the question? Pinky. Down. Pinky. Pinky 
was always there. And Pinky was almost like a

18:46.989 --> 19:01.611
native of Bryan because he was born in, if I'm not 
mistaken, right near Waco over in down there where

19:03.110 --> 19:08.655
he was a banker, if I recall correctly. But he loved 
A&M so much that he kept coming back up there all the

19:09.776 --> 19:13.480
time. And finally, he just moved his family up 
there and became an unofficial greeter. And he'd

19:20.667 --> 19:27.233
walk around the campus, and anyone coming in, he'd 
introduce himself and see what he could do to help

19:20.667 --> 19:27.233
them, show them around. Now, was he doing that when 
you were an undergraduate? Oh, yeah. Describe him

19:31.317 --> 19:32.458
physically. Well, I say he was doing it without an 
undergraduate. Yes, he was on that campus nearly

19:36.971 --> 19:54.548
all the time and I think he was a small thin man with 
his glasses and but a very friendly manner, very

19:36.971 --> 19:54.548
garrulous and he liked to talk about A&M. He liked 
to show people around. He was so proud of it. Was

19:57.591 --> 20:01.375
Lupo there when you were an undergraduate? Oh 
yeah, Lupo was very much with his outfit. I never

20:05.529 --> 20:13.437
did go and utilize his store, because I didn't need 
to, as many students did. But Leupold was an

20:14.157 --> 20:18.501
institution, and still that he died.

20:21.103 --> 20:21.524
Let's see. Describe what it was like to try to get a 
date on an all-male campus. How did an Aggie get a

20:27.910 --> 20:29.351
date? Well, the dates that Well, the girls I was 
interested in were either at the University or in

20:33.256 --> 20:38.282
Corpus Christi. I didn't try to get any dates. I 
corresponded with my dates at home or in Austin, or

20:40.886 --> 20:50.898
I'd go to see them when I could possibly get away, 
and I'd have them come see me for one of these ball

20:40.886 --> 20:50.898
weekends. But there were a few lovely girls there 
in the Bryan area, A few of them I remember.

21:08.482 --> 21:09.644
It's kind of difficult right now.

21:12.348 --> 21:16.313
About how often would you have a date come to 
College Station? I had not. No, no. When one of the

21:18.176 --> 21:24.826
girls from Austin or... Oh, three or four times a 
semester, two or three times a semester. Was it

21:24.846 --> 21:27.430
your task to pay her expenses? No, no. She paid all. 
And they came, how did they get to College Station?

21:34.251 --> 21:40.860
They'd come by train or out of the range for their 
parents or someone to bring them up.

21:44.706 --> 21:46.508
Usually that way. You told me that they stayed at 
the Aggieland Inn or in someone's home. Where did

21:50.534 --> 21:53.719
they eat? Aggieland Inn had a little restaurant 
there. But you didn't take them into Sabeasa? Oh

21:58.605 --> 22:00.026
yes, sometimes. Sometimes. There was special 
privileges on weekends that way you could take

22:01.628 --> 22:06.574
your date. Did the routine at the dining table 
change when there were... Oh yes, oh yes. It was all

22:11.259 --> 22:14.282
fun though. Describe the community of College 
Station. What was at the North Gate area? Well, the

22:23.213 --> 22:42.194
Northgate area had a post office there that we 
utilized, and of course, Lou Pott was there, and he

22:23.213 --> 22:42.194
had a hamburger joint or two up there, and a bank 
there, and that's about it. There wasn't any big

22:42.254 --> 22:48.641
operations, but we had a very small student body 
and a small campus there. What was at Southgate?

22:50.323 --> 22:52.005
Was there anything on Southside? I think except 
the old primarily. Over on the east side on the new

22:55.489 --> 22:58.273
highway? On the new highway, of course, just 
beginning to blossom a little bit with saving a

22:58.893 --> 23:06.083
loan. Had a small store or two.

23:14.754 --> 23:22.144
You know, it wasn't,

23:14.754 --> 23:22.144
that would have been a day to go in there and buy four 
or five hundred acres. How often did y'all go to

23:23.609 --> 23:25.311
Bryan?

23:28.495 --> 23:31.179
Oh, once a month maybe. How did you get there? With 
each other. And what was there in downtown Bryan

23:36.065 --> 23:39.750
that interested a young student? The theater 
there and that was about it. Just the novelty of

23:46.518 --> 23:53.447
getting off the A&M campus and going there for a 
special hamburger or something. What

23:54.845 --> 24:08.740
major national or international events do you 
remember while you were a student? Anything that

24:08.760 --> 24:13.265
you remember on the radio or in the newspaper that 
caught your attention?

24:17.390 --> 24:22.455
Well, Roosevelt was president then. things were 
happening in Europe, the Germans and the Nazi

24:24.089 --> 24:41.072
effort beginning to form some clouds, you know, 
around. When I

24:41.432 --> 24:52.948
went to Europe, on the Cotton Fellowship, that was 
after I graduated. at the summer of 1937. We went

24:58.446 --> 25:06.659
through Germany and it was the only country where I 
went that I felt uncomfortable. As you got on the

25:06.679 --> 25:23.104
trains and moved from one place to another, you see 
these brown shirted young men officially going

25:06.679 --> 25:23.104
through there and throwing their weight around 
and looking at you with question marks. and maybe

25:23.455 --> 25:27.459
even asking you for identification and so forth. 
And you'd see train load after train load as you

25:28.179 --> 25:39.270
passed on the tracks of caissons and artillery 
pieces and things moving. And there was a feeling

25:39.290 --> 25:41.972
of uneasiness. The only place I was robbed was in 
Cologne in a hotel. My room was broken in there. And

25:49.680 --> 25:51.201
when I went out for breakfast, My purse was stolen. 
Fortunately, I didn't have much money in it. But I

25:55.840 --> 26:01.887
did have a few checks, but quickly had them 
exchanged.

26:04.370 --> 26:06.192
But I still enjoyed Germany. We took a trip down to 
Cologne, right by the front of Cologne, and down

26:06.212 --> 26:12.179
the river, the Rhine River. It was an interesting 
trip. But I felt uneasy there. We all did. Did you

26:21.252 --> 26:29.204
and other students listen to the president's 
fireside chats on the radio? Did you all listen to

26:29.224 --> 26:32.729
Franklin Roosevelt? Frankly, I didn't even have a 
radio in my room. I didn't have time to do anything

26:38.277 --> 26:42.163
but study. and work and go to sleep and eat. That 
would put it well. And take part in my cavalry

26:47.721 --> 27:01.381
activities and my monkey trail training and my 
tumbling team and a little fencing and that sort of

26:47.721 --> 27:01.381
thing. Camaraderie with my little bit around with 
my friends. Describe your dorm room. How big was

27:10.477 --> 27:11.278
it? What was in it? Who was in it? The dorm room I had 
was about half the size of this room, which is

27:13.020 --> 27:22.751
about, I'd say, about 15 by 30 or 25. And we each had a 
Spartan desk chair. We each had a double bunk in

27:29.299 --> 27:33.583
there. I had a bunk each. One place we had a double 
bunk. and matches and springs, and we were

27:39.046 --> 27:47.400
responsible for keeping it clean, but it was 
spotty. And

27:47.420 --> 27:54.713
what were the student indulgences of that time? 
Did many students smoke, and if so, what did they

27:54.773 --> 27:58.219
smoke? Well, they smoked cigarettes and they 
smoked cigars occasionally because there was a

27:59.684 --> 28:06.454
big man on the campus. When you're a senior, you get 
some cigars every now and then. What was the

28:09.900 --> 28:12.243
popular cigarette brand? Lucky Strike, 
Chesterfield, Camel. Were there any places off

28:19.134 --> 28:24.342
campus that students went to get alcoholic 
beverages? Hard liquors, I never went there

28:25.587 --> 28:38.745
because I didn't have any money to spend for it, but 
also I wasn't a beer

28:25.587 --> 28:38.745
drinker. I never went to hard liquors one time. 
Hard liquors served beer? They served beer. Was

28:46.242 --> 28:50.168
there a place, it was, I know officially the county 
was dry, or I think it was. Was there, were there

28:50.508 --> 28:53.152
places to buy whiskey? The only thing I know about 
hot liggers is what I heard. I never went in there to

28:56.437 --> 28:58.741
this day. I never went in there. Was there a 
bootlegger anywhere that you? I heard that there

29:02.847 --> 29:06.833
was some available. And I never knew where they 
were, but a friend like Bailey Conahan would know

29:07.387 --> 29:22.896
and Bailey would find who we needed for one of these 
special big dances and parties. There was things

29:23.758 --> 29:27.184
to do to go out and have a little start. It wasn't 
nobody else. It wasn't offensive. Was there

29:30.947 --> 29:33.791
alcohol at any of the social events? Was there 
alcohol at the dances? I'd say no, there was not any

29:35.433 --> 29:49.269
except you'd go outside and a few guys, you know, to 
show off more than yes, would have a pint of booze of

29:35.433 --> 29:49.269
some kind, moonshine. Did any students use snuff 
or chewing tobacco? You know, they would have been

29:54.772 --> 30:09.616
looking down at it pretty good if they did, and the 
rare, rare need that I recall, if ever seen, I'm

29:54.772 --> 30:09.616
sure we did have some shooting back then, but I was 
not conscious of it. Did you even know the word

30:09.636 --> 30:11.539
marijuana? No, never heard of it. Didn't even know 
what it was until many years later in life. Let's

30:17.869 --> 30:20.273
see, court trips. Courtships we made once or twice 
a year, and of course as a Ross volunteer, we made

30:21.012 --> 30:50.952
one or two trips too, and as

30:21.012 --> 30:50.952
the courtships were special, we usually went into 
Fort Worth or Dallas, and we always arranged ahead

30:21.012 --> 30:50.952
of time for dates, or tried to, through our friends 
who lived in that area, and there were always

30:21.012 --> 30:50.952
occasions for Special occasions for fun. And 
y'all would, how did you get up to Fort Worth or

30:54.606 --> 31:01.415
Dallas, Houston or Austin? Train, usually, or

31:01.756 --> 31:10.127
you'd make your own transportation 
arrangements. And when did you leave? Did you

31:11.349 --> 31:14.474
leave early Saturday morning or Friday 
afternoon? I don't recall, but usually early

31:15.054 --> 31:18.699
Saturday morning, I'm sure, probably. But by the 
time Friday afternoon, nothing could get old. And

31:22.606 --> 31:29.316
then what happened, football games were, and day 
games, what happened on Saturday night? Well,

31:29.816 --> 31:35.424
that's when we all got out and had our dates, and we 
saw the town, you know. We wasn't doing anything

31:35.444 --> 31:40.952
but walking around with our dates around, with 
downtown lights and everything.
