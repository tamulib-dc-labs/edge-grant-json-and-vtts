00:01.972 --> 00:22.230
First, Mr. McQuillan, tell us something about 
your early life, including the names of your

00:01.972 --> 00:22.230
parents, the dates of their birth and death, and 
the places of their birth, the place and date of

00:01.972 --> 00:22.230
your birth, and the schools you attended before 
you came to Texas A&M.

00:25.132 --> 00:30.477
Well, my father's name was James E. McQuillan. My 
mother's name was Aiden McQuillan, and I don't

00:31.570 --> 00:38.420
have the dates of their death.

00:42.245 --> 00:49.135
He worked for the Santa Fe Railroad, and we lived 
all up and down the Santa Fe Railroad in Texas.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.063
I started school in Gainesville, Texas. And then 
we moved to Sillsby, Texas, where I went to school.

01:01.059 --> 01:07.587
And then we moved to Cleburne, Texas, where I 
graduated from Cleburne High School. I entered

01:07.607 --> 01:10.931
here in the fall of 1916. Where were you born? I was 
born in Palestine, Texas. And on what date? June

01:17.239 --> 01:19.482
the 9th, 1898.

01:21.487 --> 01:26.634
And I entered here in the fall of 16 and graduated in 
the spring of 1920. And

01:26.834 --> 01:41.054
then I went to the University of Wisconsin for a 
year and got a master's degree and came back here

01:26.834 --> 01:41.054
and taught in the animal husbandry department for 
a year. What were the factors involved in your

01:42.156 --> 01:45.761
choice of Texas A&M? Well, largely because I 
didn't have to take any math. I mean, you could go

01:52.165 --> 01:54.849
through the full four-year curriculum. At that 
time, you could without taking any mathematics.

01:57.734 --> 01:58.235
Without taking any math. I didn't want any 
mathematics. That

01:59.477 --> 02:04.164
is like everything else. Things happen. I didn't 
know what I was going to do in the spring of my senior

02:05.366 --> 02:14.881
year, and Dr. Brazell came by. Well, we used to sit 
under the trees out there in front of Leggett Hall.

02:19.165 --> 02:23.691
after supper, and he walked by there one day and 
asked me what I was going to do, and I said, I didn't

02:19.165 --> 02:23.691
know. He said, how would you like to go to the 
University of Wisconsin and take a master's

02:24.732 --> 02:29.578
degree? I said, well, that sounds pretty good. He 
said, if you'll do that, and then you come back

02:32.482 --> 02:36.968
here, I'll give you a job, pay you $2,400 a year. 
That sounds like lots of money. So that's the way

02:39.992 --> 02:41.794
that happened. And it happened that way. I came 
back here and stayed a year. Then I went to Dallas.

02:49.017 --> 02:51.219
and was in the insurance business for three years. 
Then I came back here in the fall of 1925

02:51.259 --> 03:04.194
as assistant to Colonel Ashburn, who was 
secretary of the Ag Students Association. How

03:04.214 --> 03:08.599
much did you know about Texas A&M before you 
enrolled as a student? Oh, practically nothing.

03:11.582 --> 03:14.265
What were your first reactions when you arrived on 
campus? Well, I thought to mess all food about it.

03:21.815 --> 03:26.922
Did you have any... Let me rephrase this. Were 
there any people to meet? I'm assuming you came by

03:30.107 --> 03:31.428
train. Were there any people there to meet, to 
train, to try to recruit you for a particular dorm

03:31.989 --> 03:38.058
or for a particular military company? Well, no, 
but there was a senior here from Cleburne that I

03:38.478 --> 03:45.788
knew, and I had come down here to attract meat. And I 
was what, in those days, they designated his fish.

03:50.751 --> 03:56.459
And I went, I'm sure, to his company, which was 
B-2nd Infantry.

04:00.405 --> 04:02.829
But there was no reception at all. We got off the 
train, went up there and found a place. And then

04:07.616 --> 04:13.024
presumably registered almost immediately. And 
B-2nd was assigned to what dormitory? Legget

04:16.576 --> 04:17.258
Hall. Legget Hall, one of the newer ones. So you 
missed out on some of the good things like carrying

04:18.581 --> 04:23.893
water and wood and all that sort of good stuff. 
Yeah, that's right. We had a deluxe

04:24.474 --> 04:26.980
accommodation, you know what I'm saying? Would 
you describe a typical day when you were a student?

04:31.802 --> 04:41.255
And I imagine you had over the four years and viewed 
the fact that the whole campus was turned into a

04:31.802 --> 04:41.255
military camp for one period of time. But would you 
kind of describe a typical day during your student

04:42.296 --> 04:51.968
days as the time you got up and what you did during 
the day and the time you went to bed? Well, the first

04:51.988 --> 04:54.231
two years, I guess. Certainly the first year. got 
up at Reveille and had calisthenics. And then we

05:01.716 --> 05:06.561
went to breakfast and then to classes. And when 
taps blew at night, all the lights went out, and

05:08.162 --> 05:14.028
that was that.

05:17.111 --> 05:22.617
It was a

05:17.111 --> 05:22.617
strictly military organization. It wasn't us. 
They weren't very strict, but everything was done

05:25.718 --> 05:32.406
by Bugle.

05:35.750 --> 05:50.989
I missed out on, in the earlier days, they used to 
form the cadet corps, which was a whole student

05:35.750 --> 05:50.989
body then, out in front of the old main building, 
and they'd march into class for that. We didn't do

05:51.009 --> 05:51.770
that. You just marched to meals. Oh, yes, we 
marched to meals. But not to classes. May I pardon?

05:57.640 --> 05:58.701
But not to classes. Not to classes, no. Did you 
march to the chapel on Sunday morning? On Sunday

06:02.746 --> 06:04.389
morning, we marched to chapel. I see. So you were in 
both the old chapel and in Guyon Hall, I believe,

06:06.211 --> 06:11.658
probably, were you not? Yes, yes. Guyon was built 
in 18, I believe. Yeah.

06:20.393 --> 06:23.877
There was so much disturbance, and it gradually 
increased. So much disturbance, I think, along my

06:25.279 --> 06:28.723
latter years. That's when they started making 
chapel voluntary. Uh-huh. But you mean

06:33.469 --> 06:34.330
disturbance? Oh, they'd cough in and throat 
clearing

06:35.131 --> 06:42.641
in the old chapel. I don't remember whether there 
were wooden floors or not, but boys... would put a

06:48.085 --> 06:53.414
match or a pencil down on the floor and roll it under 
their foot.

06:56.159 --> 06:58.103
Wasn't real now, but sort of, you know. Get enough 
of them doing it. Distant thunder, you know.

07:03.152 --> 07:06.518
I doubt if any of us profited much from the chapel 
exercises. Well, oftentimes it required chapel

07:06.758 --> 07:11.106
very much. But then, and so they, in your later 
years, chapel was voluntary then. Voluntary, I

07:16.434 --> 07:18.298
believe, my last year.

07:22.725 --> 07:26.232
You mentioned you thought that the food in the mess 
hall was pretty good. Yeah. How would, could you

07:28.055 --> 07:30.980
expand on that? Well. Tell us a little bit about 
what you did get to eat. The main thing I can

07:36.938 --> 07:42.726
remember that we got to eat was toast. They toasted 
those great big pieces of bread. I don't know how

07:45.210 --> 07:46.512
they did it. I never had seen any kind of toast like 
that when I was growing up. And I grew up in an

07:50.337 --> 07:56.306
average family.

07:58.750 --> 08:01.353
And then once a week we used to have steaks.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.000
And we always had dessert. Of course, I was always a 
hungry fellow. I had no trouble with hot cakes, you

08:12.166 --> 08:18.272
know, for breakfast and things of that sort. I 
thought it was fine. Did you get much dessert when

08:20.575 --> 08:22.437
you were a fish? Well, from time to time, yeah.

08:29.024 --> 08:30.806
But you did have to give it up occasionally. You had 
to give it up occasionally, yeah. Did you ever have

08:33.889 --> 08:36.392
any prune rices? Any what? Any prune races in the 
mess hall when you were there? No.

08:45.456 --> 08:47.238
What was life like in the dormitory? Was it pretty 
docile or pretty hectic? Well, I think it was

08:50.422 --> 08:54.187
pretty much up to the individual, really. If he let 
other people alone, they let him alone. We always,

08:58.613 --> 09:02.818
I can remember, they're always in any, on any 
floor, There were, oh, you call them hell raisers

09:03.592 --> 09:13.085
or whatnot, noisy and running around the 
hallways.

09:14.968 --> 09:18.313
But if you wanted to study, well, they let you 
alone. Did you have a guard mount every night?

09:20.436 --> 09:21.337
Yeah. Was that for all four years, or did they 
change it? No, I think just for the first couple of

09:23.941 --> 09:25.783
years. The war came along then, you know, and that 
changed a lot of things. So they discontinued

09:31.471 --> 09:32.873
the... What

09:33.460 --> 09:42.854
did the students do for entertainment and 
recreation?

09:46.118 --> 09:54.971
Oh, sat around and pulled and of course everybody 
in those days was very much interested in

09:46.118 --> 09:54.971
athletics. You wouldn't miss an athletic event of 
any kind.

10:00.730 --> 10:05.975
I'm not sure just when it started, probably built 
while I was in school. We had a, we called it the

10:05.995 --> 10:14.583
Airdrome, which is over where the chapel is now, 
the Chapel of Meditation and Prayer. They had

10:16.665 --> 10:22.571
picture shows a couple of nights a week.

10:22.591 --> 10:28.136
And of course, dances were a big thing in those 
days, but there weren't too many of them. How many,

10:28.156 --> 10:29.978
do you remember, how many did you have Oh, let's 
see, we think we had a Thanksgiving dance, and we

10:31.510 --> 10:42.603
had an RV dance,

10:31.510 --> 10:42.603
and a final ball. Those were the big ones, and I 
guess scattered around probably, but there were

10:45.226 --> 10:55.358
no smaller dances like a departmental group or 
anything of that sort. What about individual

10:55.625 --> 10:57.627
classes? I think now some of the individual 
classes, like the freshmen, juniors, and seniors

10:57.728 --> 11:04.015
or something, have a dance. Well, we had a junior 
ball. The juniors had a banquet, and I guess with a

11:09.201 --> 11:14.548
dance afterwards. I don't remember the dance part 
particularly. I believe in connection with the

11:17.912 --> 11:24.940
junior banquet, I just checked the longhorn for 
your senior year, and I believe there was some

11:25.426 --> 11:31.575
indication that you were a master or toastmaster 
at that junior banquet, at a junior banquet. Yeah,

11:32.857 --> 11:33.638
that's right. I believe there was some mention 
made of your being conducted into the mess hall by a

11:33.919 --> 11:39.567
brilliant plan. Well, the big deal in those days 
was for the sophomores to kidnap the junior

11:40.949 --> 11:50.643
toastmaster. To start with, they had to find out 
who he was. And, uh, It just got worse and worse as an

11:55.143 --> 12:00.451
activity carried to extreme. And it got to where 
they'd send her on maybe four or five and kidnap all

12:02.575 --> 12:12.190
of

12:02.575 --> 12:12.190
them. They did not kidnap me.

12:16.797 --> 12:19.581
I had some friends here on the campus and a 
classmate. who was kin to them, and they hid me in

12:21.198 --> 12:37.976
their house where they lived up on the campus, and 
spirited me into the mess hall without any trouble

12:21.198 --> 12:37.976
really, and I put on woman's clothes and walked on 
in. You were in disguise then. It had been hinted to

12:41.199 --> 12:50.209
me that there was this tradition, so to speak, of 
kidnapping the Toastmaster. Was the toastmaster

12:51.792 --> 12:55.015
for the junior banquet a junior? Yes, I'm sure he 
was. So it would have been in your junior year that

12:57.117 --> 13:01.901
you were toastmaster for the junior banquet. And I 
had understood that the sophomores attempted to

13:01.921 --> 13:07.306
kidnap this person. They were quite elaborate. It 
just got to be a nuisance. And the college finally

13:09.789 --> 13:12.071
just said, you're not going to have any more of 
that. Just discontinued the junior banquet then.

13:15.174 --> 13:17.356
What was the procedure of choosing a toastmaster? 
I don't know. You don't remember? I don't know, I

13:19.758 --> 13:20.719
guess. class elected them, I don't know. Well it 
would have had to been by secret ballot and only a

13:23.672 --> 13:28.899
select few would know then who it was.

13:39.353 --> 13:46.622
We know that you know the upperclassmen and 
primarily say the sophomores but the rest of them

13:39.353 --> 13:46.622
could choose a fish as their man, and that kind of 
gave them the privilege of assigning duties of one

13:47.058 --> 13:54.629
sort or another to the freshmen. But can you tell us 
about any other kinds of privileges that

13:55.971 --> 14:03.421
upperclassmen had as opposed to what freshmen 
might do?

14:07.788 --> 14:13.656
No, and the practice of freshmen doing room 
service, orderly work, that came after my time. I

14:20.033 --> 14:23.398
think it was just starting, probably my last year. 
I never was in anybody's room orderly. But that got

14:27.965 --> 14:30.348
to be pretty worrisome, too. Pretty. I mean, 
making the beds and getting a whole room ready for

14:32.772 --> 14:36.056
inspection. Sweeping out the room. Cleaning 
rifles and... Do what? Cleaning rifles. Yeah,

14:43.076 --> 14:46.961
just do anything that the sophomore wanted to.

14:49.926 --> 14:51.668
I don't know just how long that lasted. It finally 
played out. Did you have any favorite

14:55.273 --> 14:56.896
instructors?

15:01.042 --> 15:03.285
And if so, could you tell us a little bit about them?

15:07.450 --> 15:10.213
Well, John Burns, of course, was my senior 
instructor. He was head of the age department, and

15:10.233 --> 15:14.317
we all were very fond of him.

15:20.002 --> 15:34.656
Tommy Mayo, I don't know that I ever had a class 
under Tommy Mayo, but I have always felt like, as a

15:20.002 --> 15:34.656
teacher, he exerted more influence on more 
students than any professor I knew.

15:39.901 --> 15:47.728
Of course, in those days, and I think it, I don't 
know how it is right now, but it got to where it was

15:39.901 --> 15:47.728
just the opposite. We went overboard on 
ingratiating ourselves with your teacher. That

15:56.277 --> 15:59.640
fell into ill repute somewhere along the line 
later. That was brown noses, you know, and stuff

15:59.820 --> 16:02.442
like that. But I used to figure when I could get that 
teacher to call me Mac, I had it made. And I wasn't

16:09.213 --> 16:14.944
about to do anything that I thought he didn't like. 
But that's frown, I don't know whether it still is

16:17.389 --> 16:23.020
or not, but for many, many years, that was very, 
that's frowned on, you know. I'm not sure. I guess

16:25.279 --> 16:28.742
it isn't quite as much frowned upon as it once was. 
Well, I hope not, because it's a silly sort of a

16:28.843 --> 16:31.365
thing. Yeah. Did the teachers commonly refer to 
the students as, like, Mr. McQuillan? Or did they

16:41.656 --> 16:43.138
use your given name? Well, I think occasionally 
they did. But I would guess that most of them just

16:45.660 --> 16:53.749
called you your last name, or your nickname, or 
your given name. But if you could get the professor

16:54.708 --> 17:00.457
or instructor to use your nickname, you would have 
it more... I thought I had it made.

17:08.009 --> 17:15.542
You mentioned Dr. Bazell somewhat earlier in the 
statement he had made to you as your senior year.

17:16.523 --> 17:20.209
What, in general, were the attitudes of the 
students toward Dr. Buzell as president? I think

17:24.304 --> 17:26.247
real fine, real fine. He

17:26.287 --> 17:34.276
was an excitable man, really. He got excited about 
Haitian and one thing or another, but he was very

17:34.336 --> 17:45.690
human, and I think that he had, during my time, had 
an excellent relationship with student body. He

17:47.628 --> 17:55.516
was able to make the transition from being 
president of an all-girls school to an all-male

17:47.628 --> 17:55.516
military school reasonably well. He'd been 
there, what, two or three years by the time you

17:57.197 --> 18:04.044
first came in, in 14, I believe.

18:04.744 --> 18:05.845
What about the commandant? Well, he was fair game 
for everybody. Just to give them considerable

18:10.230 --> 18:12.232
trouble. In what kind of, what types of ways did you 
give him trouble? Oh, just dislike and

18:17.277 --> 18:31.416
occasionally

18:17.277 --> 18:31.416
throwing rocks at his house. That was very seldom 
as far as I know, but did happen.

18:38.445 --> 18:40.248
But just didn't like the commandant. Who was 
commandant? Well, Colonel Muller was the

18:42.931 --> 18:47.217
principal commandant when I was in school. He was a 
tough disciplinarian, but we came to have a pretty

18:47.618 --> 18:59.012
sound respect for him. He was fair.

19:03.457 --> 19:12.849
He was a martinet, but he got along pretty good. But 
you did try to give him a hard time occasionally.

19:16.293 --> 19:16.393
Yeah. Well, of course, in those days, kids were 
less inclined, I think, to rebel.

19:29.128 --> 19:31.531
Well, it's like mess hall food. Now, of course, all 
through the years, there's been a complaint about

19:31.551 --> 19:34.354
mess hall food. Less now, I hear, than any time I can 
remember. But by and large, we thought it was

19:37.799 --> 19:41.283
pretty good eating. Yeah, well, I presume that... 
The complaints would stem primarily from the lack

19:45.179 --> 19:58.936
of variety as opposed to insufficient quantity 
and bad taste of it. I think they have such a wide

19:59.276 --> 20:11.811
variety now that most of them probably never ate so 
well in their

19:59.276 --> 20:11.811
lives. One of the things which I feel makes Texas 
A&M the unique school that it is is the number of

20:13.951 --> 20:25.186
traditions which are carried on by the student 
body. Do you remember during your years as a

20:26.989 --> 20:36.261
student, did you have a bonfire, yell practice, 
silver taps? We had yell practice, and I don't

20:37.643 --> 20:42.810
think we had a bonfire when I was in school. I don't 
remember one. I never did work on one.

20:50.021 --> 20:51.303
I think we had silver taps. I think they've 
embellished it since then. I don't think we went

20:54.626 --> 20:58.611
out and formed anything of that sort. I think it's 
blue silver taps. Whenever someone, whenever a

21:01.735 --> 21:05.659
student died.

21:07.765 --> 21:13.331
I think it's like so many of those things, they add 
on to them year by year by year. It's sort of like the

21:13.912 --> 21:16.695
bonfire. I think, as far as I can remember, one of 
the earlier days, if they had a bonfire with just a

21:17.255 --> 21:37.317
few apple barrels, apple crates piled up out there 
in Drillfield and all of us cutting down trees.

21:38.242 --> 21:39.163
What about muster? I don't recall anything about 
the muster when I was in school. We didn't have a

21:45.590 --> 21:47.071
student muster. As there is now. Yeah. As a matter 
of fact, we built that tradition up.

21:57.702 --> 22:06.932
There had been a tradition for many years about A&M 
clubs meeting on April 21st. promoted

22:07.267 --> 22:22.305
particularly didn't amount to much and sometime 
along I guess in the late 30s or early 40s we decided

22:07.267 --> 22:22.305
we could build that thing up to a major proposition 
and we did.

22:26.389 --> 22:32.076
But I don't recall it.

22:32.697 --> 22:45.850
The story I'd heard about the student body in 1903

22:32.697 --> 22:45.850
wanting to have a ceremony of some sort to 
celebrate Texas' independence. Well, they

22:45.870 --> 22:48.193
wanted a holiday is what they wanted. And I had 
understood that was the origin of the annual

22:48.213 --> 22:53.358
muster. Yeah, that was. And I think that's pretty 
well established. That actually happened. They

22:57.822 --> 23:01.506
marched on the president's house. But as I say, 
because they weren't going to have any holiday.

23:07.468 --> 23:17.459
And my guess is that some student got up and said, 
let's go over and ask the president about this

23:07.468 --> 23:17.459
business. And we really went. And he got out pretty 
good and said, well, we'll take a holiday this

23:19.722 --> 23:26.430
morning.

23:27.997 --> 23:29.539
Let's go back to class this afternoon. And from 
here on out, though, we're going to have a

23:29.579 --> 23:32.923
celebration on April 21st. So that's the way it 
started. But it smoldered along all those years

23:35.706 --> 23:42.054
until we got rid of building up. Now, whereas they 
had a holiday and not much of a ceremony, today we

23:43.015 --> 23:51.365
have a big ceremony and no holiday. That was the 
middle of the ceremony. What about airing out? Did

23:57.713 --> 24:00.537
you get aired out a number of times when you were a 
fish? No. No, that's another later development. I

24:04.804 --> 24:07.368
don't have any recollection of any airing out.

24:10.873 --> 24:16.522
Well, it might have been just in your particular 
dormitory that you weren't aired out. I was going

24:16.542 --> 24:25.155
to say, I'm sure there was a tremendous difference 
in dormitories or military units.

24:27.093 --> 24:31.461
We know that from time to time there were girls 
attending classes. Did you have any girls in any

24:32.563 --> 24:35.588
classes that you attended? No. Do you know of any 
girls who were on campus in classes when you were a

24:36.369 --> 24:41.178
student?

24:44.223 --> 24:45.946
No, I don't believe I did. Someone told me just 
recently that that there was a continuing

24:48.625 --> 24:59.755
increase in the number of girls under Dr. Bazell's 
administration as president, and that his desire

24:48.625 --> 24:59.755
to increase the number of girls was one of the 
factors in his departure.

25:02.497 --> 25:03.418
Oh, I doubt that. After all, he

25:04.179 --> 25:17.991
was offered a job at a major state university that I 
think entirely logical that he accepted it. Step

25:21.525 --> 25:22.347
up the ladder. That's right, yeah. Now, Bazell was 
not one to hold back on a scrap. He battled the board

25:31.822 --> 25:39.794
of directors or anybody else, but I don't, I never 
did know of any particular trouble he got into.

25:39.815 --> 25:41.397
Well, I didn't, I really had the impression that he 
was in trouble, but that there might have been some

25:41.950 --> 25:46.175
pressure. I would guess that his inclination was 
all towards the girls. He

25:50.439 --> 25:57.867
was a very liberal man, I mean by that. He was a 
humanistic man as compared to engineering,

25:59.429 --> 26:04.555
something of that sort.

26:10.001 --> 26:11.282
Okay. I noted in your clippings about you and your 
write-up in the Longhorn that you participated in

26:12.325 --> 26:23.257
athletics quite a bit. Did the students who were on 
the college teams enjoy privileges that the

26:24.118 --> 26:31.806
normal students didn't have? Well, I think only we 
had a training table. That's as far as I know it, but

26:37.672 --> 26:40.675
I think that was just regular food. It was just 
served at separate times, separate hours. This

26:45.639 --> 26:48.622
would accommodate your practices. I presume 
occasionally you were able to misdrill because of

26:49.703 --> 27:04.877
practice, but generally you had to abide by the 
other rules that the students

26:49.703 --> 27:04.877
had.

27:07.827 --> 27:11.170
We know that a lot of students worked while they 
were in school. Did you ever have a job while you

27:11.230 --> 27:13.492
were in school? Oh, I had various odd jobs. I 
cleaned test tubes in the biology department once

27:16.135 --> 27:25.524
a term, and I maintained tennis courts another 
term, but nothing regular.

27:28.927 --> 27:30.969
I wasn't what I'd call a working student.

27:34.072 --> 27:35.573
Well, I could imagine with the amount of practice 
you would have to do in basketball, and I think you

27:36.920 --> 27:41.705
ran track one year or so. You would occupy a lot of 
your time. You wouldn't have much time for

27:43.407 --> 27:44.749
working. Well, of course, there again, finance 
was so simple in those days. You paid your fee at the

27:49.494 --> 27:55.481
beginning of school, and that carries you through 
the semester. And it's covered board, room, and

27:56.843 --> 27:59.145
laundry. And you already had your uniform, and 
there wasn't much spent money for.

28:06.890 --> 28:16.525
Oh, we had a lot of students working, but then it 
wasn't the financial struggle that it is today, if

28:06.890 --> 28:16.525
you went at all.

28:20.351 --> 28:33.572
Of course, there were always a few students that 
did struggle, and I guess just lived from hand to

28:20.351 --> 28:33.572
mouth, practically, but there weren't very many 
of them. Much of that came a little bit later, I

28:34.328 --> 28:49.148
would imagine, during the Depression, in the 
project houses and that sort

28:34.328 --> 28:49.148
of thing.
