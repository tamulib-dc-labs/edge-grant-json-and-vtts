WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:08.005
Okay, now was Colonel Patton in charge at this 
time? Colonel Patton was more or less a

00:09.146 --> 00:23.425
second-in-command of the 2nd Armored Division as 
a colonel and he promoted the brigadier and then to

00:09.146 --> 00:23.425
division commander. And he remained as division 
commander until we started for Africa We landed in

00:32.296 --> 00:35.959
Africa on November the 8th, 1942.

00:45.628 --> 01:01.122
Just prior to that time, I had

00:45.628 --> 01:01.122
been assigned, I had been pulled out of the 2nd Army 
Division temporarily and assigned to the 5th Army

01:02.047 --> 01:16.429
Division out in California to do some, make some 
determinations in the desert on whether or not we

01:02.047 --> 01:16.429
have gasoline engines or diesel engines. The 
schooling was the forerunner of that. So, I ran

01:20.796 --> 01:24.221
these tests out in the desert. As soon as that was 
over,

01:30.481 --> 01:33.644
six months, I guess, or so. I was sent

01:33.664 --> 01:53.542
on a very sensitive mission to South America by 
another agency of our government. And when I

01:53.562 --> 01:59.728
finished that- Well, can you tell me

01:53.562 --> 01:59.728
about that?

02:04.433 --> 02:09.161
A member of the Navy and I from the Army had been 
selected.

02:11.766 --> 02:17.455
Best I can say to you is that German submarines were 
putting people ashore in Brazil. Agents ashore.

02:24.668 --> 02:29.496
And I was sent to Belém, Brazil.

02:34.623 --> 02:40.590
there

02:34.623 --> 02:40.590
in activities which I don't want to discuss. This 
is in 1942? No, this was in 1942.

02:52.585 --> 02:58.592
And then I went- Then did you miss Operation Torch 
or did you go through with the landing in North

02:52.585 --> 02:58.592
Africa? I missed it by a few days, joined them just 
about the time it was over with. Well, why did they

03:04.272 --> 03:13.024
pick you to take on the sensitive

03:04.272 --> 03:13.024
mission to Brazil? I think that determination was 
made by my

03:13.044 --> 03:33.874
regimental and division commander at the time, 
which they had been placed a requirement to send a

03:13.044 --> 03:33.874
guy of a certain caliber and mentality and 
experience and that sort of thing.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.030
So that's what happened. And how long did this 
last? It lasted until

03:47.714 --> 04:05.097
December

03:47.714 --> 04:05.097
of about the first of December 1942

03:47.714 --> 04:05.097
and I went straight away back to the Second Army 
Division. So it was an OSS operation basically?

04:07.760 --> 04:09.242
Sort of thing, yes. Except

04:14.523 --> 04:21.754
another branch of the federal government had a 
responsibility.

04:21.774 --> 04:38.218
And the reason I don't want to touch on that too much 
is a simple reason that

04:21.774 --> 04:38.218
there is still conflict within our government as 
to who has responsibilities on certain security

04:21.774 --> 04:38.218
matters outside the United States. There's a lot 
of controversy. And I don't want to get involved in

04:40.818 --> 04:45.383
participating in that. I just know that we didn't 
have a CIA back in the old days, but we did have a FBI,

04:45.403 --> 04:50.389
right? And a damn good one under one of the greatest 
guys that ever lived, J. Edgar Hoover. And I don't

04:58.378 --> 05:02.703
see his picture here, but it's in this household 
somewhere. He was one hell of a man. I don't give a

05:06.633 --> 05:09.077
damn what people say about him now. I think he's one 
of the greatest guys that we've ever had. So you had

05:12.362 --> 05:14.406
an opportunity to meet him? Oh, I know him, yes. 
Well, now that we're on him, can you describe your

05:16.309 --> 05:20.416
meeting with him? Well, he was a man of uncommon 
loyalty and honesty to the United States of

05:21.778 --> 05:30.813
America. Uncommon in that regard. Ruthless on 
inefficiencies and any incompetencies that

05:35.067 --> 05:45.122
might occur, and I believe in all those things. I am 
very ruthless, and I've become very

05:46.103 --> 05:52.873
controversial in the military about that sort of 
thing. Amongst seniors who should be very

05:54.455 --> 06:04.450
confident or shouldn't be there.

06:05.695 --> 06:07.957
I felt this very strongly about him. I thought he 
was a nice warm man and I liked him very much.

06:18.669 --> 06:22.193
Warm usually isn't the word that most people use 
with Jagger. No, but he had a personal feeling. He

06:27.439 --> 06:30.302
treated me that way, I tell you.

06:32.813 --> 06:36.338
And did you get to meet him then in 1942 or was this 
later on? Later on, later on. Later on. And in what

06:40.764 --> 06:45.950
capacity?

06:48.113 --> 06:52.780
I've been a very strong law enforcement type guy. 
You can see a few badges up there.

06:59.368 --> 07:00.610
I think that

07:02.767 --> 07:32.200
that the military has a responsibility for not 
only exterior but interior security, but I would

07:02.767 --> 07:32.200
like to thank the people that's got the greatest 
responsibility for interior security as our

07:02.767 --> 07:32.200
national state and county police systems for 
internal security. For external security, the

07:40.601 --> 07:46.990
Army, Navy, and Air Force, and Marines, and the 
Coast Guard.

07:50.235 --> 08:02.473
But in order, if the internal security, the 
interior, had a problem

07:50.235 --> 08:02.473
that it can't cope with, The Army, Navy, Air Force, 
Coast Guard, Marines are there to assist. So, if

08:11.034 --> 08:31.363
you're doing your job in the military, and 
particularly in the Army,

08:11.034 --> 08:31.363
you've got to know as much about the internal 
security makeup and systems and how it performs

08:11.034 --> 08:31.363
and works and its inadequacies and its advantages 
and disadvantages and and that sort of thing in

08:32.187 --> 08:36.513
order for you to properly support it and work with 
it. And as a result of that, I gained their respect

08:39.397 --> 08:47.169
and confidence wherever I signed in the United 
States. And I've been involved in many seminars

08:49.472 --> 08:54.639
with law enforcement agencies. We're in the FBI 
and the alcohol, tobacco, people, the county

09:02.478 --> 09:24.223
sheriffs, the

09:02.478 --> 09:24.223
municipal chief of police,

09:02.478 --> 09:24.223
state security elements, state highway patrol, 
and so on and forth involved in. I've lectured in

09:25.605 --> 09:30.190
their schools continuously ever go, worked with 
them. and offered advice and assistance and

09:31.672 --> 09:46.406
gained their support and the management of my own 
30 or 40,000 man fort and the people that's

09:31.672 --> 09:46.406
involved and that sort of stuff, you see. So, 
that's how it came about. Well, tell me about

09:50.209 --> 09:54.633
Patton.

09:54.653 --> 10:00.058
Well, I like to say this, that

10:03.700 --> 10:06.824
First off, I can't be a Patton. Nobody can be a 
Patton. Nobody can be me. Nobody can be you. And

10:16.197 --> 10:19.222
some people say, oh, he's trying to be another 
Patton. Anybody's foolish and unknowingly

10:21.685 --> 10:28.554
foolish if they say that about anybody.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.560
But I like... the way he operated. I liked the way he 
could ride a horse. I liked the way he could shoot a

10:38.870 --> 10:40.873
shotgun. I

10:42.435 --> 10:49.085
liked the way he could run a yacht. I liked the way he 
was really a proud historian.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.483
That's what made George Patton his history.

11:04.653 --> 11:05.995
George, he graduated. He took a five-year course 
at West Point like I did at A&M, except I didn't have

11:06.035 --> 11:12.724
to go the fifth year. I just had to wait out my 
diploma. He took five years at West Point to get

11:16.128 --> 11:22.296
through.

11:25.400 --> 11:31.288
But history made George the love of history, just 
like that's what's going to do for you. You see? Why

11:34.943 --> 11:42.313
do you want to go out and make the same mistake next 
year that was made 35 years ago? Well, the reason

11:43.534 --> 11:48.141
you do it is you didn't know it was made 35 years ago 
or you wouldn't make it, would you? Huh? Well, how

11:49.022 --> 11:52.146
in the hell did you find out what happened 35 years 
ago? By God, you've got to study history. Now,

11:56.792 --> 12:04.242
sometimes you're going to find that it was 
recorded very poorly and it's very difficult to

11:56.792 --> 12:04.242
interpret, and there's an art of recording. so 
people can interpret, you know, a recording

12:05.470 --> 12:10.916
history. The main thing I guess about that is the 
fact that you've got to, and I found this true in the

12:10.936 --> 12:34.701
military, that to record everything that 
occurred in this particular battle that's been

12:10.936 --> 12:34.701
going on for the last five days, at the conclusion 
of it, is a very wasteful thing to history. because

12:36.520 --> 12:57.786
there's no way you can remember every detail it 
should have been recorded every day at the end of

12:36.520 --> 12:57.786
the day but who is it that can go five days and five 
nights and close in the rural pocket and I did that

12:36.520 --> 12:57.786
on the north and record everything sometime 
during the night When you're so dead tired and

12:58.306 --> 13:08.121
you're so worried about your troops and worried 
about getting your objective, who in the hell is

12:58.306 --> 13:08.121
going to spend the time on writing what happened 
that day? And who can afford a historian when

13:09.543 --> 13:20.179
you're running your tank cruiser short?

13:20.834 --> 13:24.860
History, we lose so much of history. It's so 
invaluable. And then somebody tries to go back and

13:26.183 --> 13:31.331
make it up, and then we accept that as a fact when it 
wasn't a fact. I'll tell you what I'm saying to you

13:32.072 --> 13:39.123
has cost us a great president,

13:32.072 --> 13:39.123
Dick Nixon. In my view, he was trying to record 
history as it really was. and not what somebody

13:47.800 --> 13:53.228
writes about it four years ago when he forgot about 
what had happened and he filled in. What

13:53.709 --> 13:55.271
contribution does that make? In other words, the 
use of the taping system? Absolutely. Let's get

13:58.856 --> 14:00.939
back to Patton here now. When did you first meet 
George Patton? I met George Patton in July 1940 at

14:03.463 --> 14:09.632
Fort Benning, Georgia. July 14th. I met him at the 
division headquarters. Oh, your first

14:16.319 --> 14:19.182
impressions? My first impression was that, god 
damn, that guy really is a sharp looking officer.

14:28.150 --> 14:30.312
And I saw a distinguished service cross. That's 
next to the Congressional Medal of Honor. Now, you

14:34.356 --> 14:36.398
can get the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
Occasionally, you'll find a guy that lives, but

14:36.458 --> 14:41.182
most of the time they're posthumously. So, a 
distinguished service cross is a very sort of

14:46.087 --> 14:53.432
thing for Extraordinary Heroes, and I liked that. 
And he had a silver star. I know what that is, too.

15:00.127 --> 15:11.220
And a very interesting thing that he interviewed 
me and thanked me for coming in and said, we're

15:00.127 --> 15:11.220
going to learn to fight this division, new 
division, new farm division. We're going to learn

15:11.361 --> 15:12.802
to fight it. We're going to learn to do it together 
and I expect you to meet all the standards and all

15:13.003 --> 15:19.671
that. I said, yes, sir, and I saluted. When I got to 
my unit that I was assigned to, that's when I found

15:23.155 --> 15:27.400
out that You're going to be in this battalion, 
Major Fry said to me, and on field exercise you're

15:28.308 --> 15:37.137
going to work with Colonel Patton. He'd already 
called him up and told him, you see. Why do you think

15:41.943 --> 15:42.984
he picked you? I don't know. Maybe he liked the way I 
looked, the way I wore my uniform or something.

15:50.071 --> 15:51.473
Maybe he liked the way I talked. You know, you can 
talk to, you can look at a guy, just like I told you, a

15:56.928 --> 15:58.531
little earlier about yourself. See, I didn't have 
to talk to you about a couple of minutes and look at

15:59.574 --> 16:02.981
you. You see what I mean? If you've been involved in 
this business of leadership, see? Oh, yes, it

16:10.196 --> 16:12.121
doesn't take many. I didn't know that then. What 
kind of leader? A lot of controversy is around Pat

16:19.468 --> 16:24.215
and his form of leadership. What did you think of 
his form? Let me give you an example.

16:31.486 --> 16:44.907
He had put out a message

16:31.486 --> 16:44.907
to all the regiments

16:31.486 --> 16:44.907
that he did not want to see any more tanks being 
driven around in training exercises with the

16:45.443 --> 16:51.793
hatches open. He said, I want all the hatches down 
and locked and learn to live that way because

16:51.813 --> 17:01.187
you're training for battle. That makes sense, 
doesn't it? So I had all of the tanks of the whole

17:06.706 --> 17:20.804
battalion, me being the only second lieutenant 
and being the training officer and not knowing

17:06.706 --> 17:20.804
anything, the only one thing else, and company 
commander, first lieutenant, had other things to

17:06.706 --> 17:20.804
do. And so I would take all the tanks out in the field 
every day for training. 300 tanks? No, no, 56 tanks

17:27.413 --> 17:31.859
for the battalion. 300 was in the regiment, and now 
in a division. I mean in the division, 300 in the

17:36.878 --> 17:40.683
division. Back in those days we had 56 per 
battalion and three battalions so you'd see 162.

17:48.434 --> 17:58.448
But anyway, I was out in the training area

17:48.434 --> 17:58.448
and we'd been out there all day and we'd carried 
along a sack lunch, and we were supposed to get back

17:59.035 --> 18:14.498
in and do maintenance on all these vehicles, and 
then we had some classwork that we had to go to,

17:59.035 --> 18:14.498
classes on subjects.

18:14.518 --> 18:27.658
So, at a place called Turkey Ford, the water run 
down through this creek, and we called that a ford

18:14.518 --> 18:27.658
there, Turkey Ford, famous area there and the old 
reservation at Fort Benning.

18:35.311 --> 18:55.654
The memorandum that he had published had

18:35.311 --> 18:55.654
been sent out, but it had not reached

18:35.311 --> 18:55.654
the battalion level, or at least the distribution 
hadn't gotten down to the companies yet.

19:01.270 --> 19:10.361
He had put the message out, and he's out now 
checking to see if it's being complied with and why

19:01.270 --> 19:10.361
it wasn't being complied with if it wasn't. In 
other words, this is a principle. You put

19:13.946 --> 19:17.951
something out, now go check to see that it's been 
done. That's

19:17.971 --> 19:22.216
what he was doing. Well, I crossed Turkey Ford. I 
was leading the tank back in. And I had the turrets

19:29.671 --> 19:35.518
open because this is a small dirt road. And I 
thought, well, I should have these turrets open so

19:37.501 --> 19:46.472
I'd call the fellas on the radio, give them 
signals. We had flags for signals which open your

19:46.552 --> 19:56.385
turrets because otherwise, so we can, we'd been 
driving with them closed out on the range, out in

19:46.552 --> 19:56.385
the woods. So you were no longer in the battle area? 
We were no longer in the battle area. We were

20:00.152 --> 20:00.772
leaving. And were they closed when you were in the 
battle area? Yes, they were closed in the battle

20:05.798 --> 20:11.844
area, but this was just a road through the woods 
coming back. Going back to the base. Going back to

20:12.585 --> 20:18.411
where I went into Cassetta Road, which is a 
blacktop road. And I knew I had to have them open

20:18.431 --> 20:20.413
then. That had been specifically brought out 
without anybody for safety reasons. Well, we were

20:25.898 --> 20:27.179
on his road. His staff car, I noticed his staff car 
parked back off in the woods. We come down through

20:33.905 --> 20:39.170
Turkey Ford water, come up on the tank on the front, 
and we come out of there. And, man, he walked out on

20:40.271 --> 20:43.795
the road and held it with his hand and stopped. So I 
pushed him back in the old days. You just touch the

20:46.137 --> 20:50.841
driver in the back between the shoulders with your 
foot there. That's the way he stopped them, so he

20:50.901 --> 20:52.783
stopped. I jumped out of the tank, went over and 
slew them. He said, Lieutenant, don't you ever

20:58.970 --> 21:01.974
read these memorandums? I said, yes, sir. He said, 
well, then why in the hell aren't you complying

21:06.199 --> 21:12.066
with it? He said, now, if you read these 
memorandums, you'll know that you're supposed to

21:12.086 --> 21:18.333
have these turrets closed in your battle area. 
You're training for battle. By God, you get them

21:21.377 --> 21:23.479
closed up right now. Yes, sir.

21:29.265 --> 21:31.267
I had seen them around. Did you tell them that? No. 
Why not? Oh, no. That was the way it was in those

21:35.712 --> 21:37.814
days. Yes, sir. No, sir. Well, we got on out 
Cassetta Road. I knew the safety factor was such

21:43.299 --> 21:47.704
that you got to open them up. We get on Cassetta 
Road. We're going about two miles, and we come to

21:49.646 --> 21:52.909
Mike. regimental headquarters

21:53.243 --> 22:20.331
which is in tents across from a place called 
Harmony Church and we had to go by there about a mile

21:53.243 --> 22:20.331
in turn to get in our bivouac area where we were 
living in tents

21:53.243 --> 22:20.331
and as we approached the regimental headquarters 
his staff car was there and he started to pull out

22:23.483 --> 22:43.293
hit the siren button on the tank and the siren went 
off and here he jumps out, Patton jumps out of his

22:23.483 --> 22:43.293
car again, this is the second time today, and 
stopped my tank column. This time I was getting a

22:43.313 --> 22:51.145
little shook up about this business, frightened 
really, because

22:53.538 --> 23:01.689
I thought for a second lieutenant to be called on 
the mat twice a day is a little bit too much. And I was

23:03.731 --> 23:11.682
feeling unkindly toward the driver who 
automatically hit the siren. And so I jumped out of

23:11.702 --> 23:15.507
the tank. What was the siren so the staff car would 
not come out on the road? Yeah, that's exactly what

23:20.113 --> 23:22.296
the driver was doing. He gave him a warning. Yeah, 
exactly. And why wasn't that not a good idea? It

23:28.652 --> 23:32.135
was, but I was shook up about it. No, let me finish 
with this. I get out and I report to him.

23:40.603 --> 23:45.167
He said, Lieutenant, why did you blow that siren? I 
didn't say, I didn't, sir. The driver did. I said,

23:55.199 --> 24:07.556
Sir, the driver blew that siren because he wanted 
to warn you that we were coming through, and he

23:55.199 --> 24:07.556
didn't want to hit your vehicle. He said, 
Lieutenant, that is a way to use your head. That is a

24:14.405 --> 24:21.274
damn fine action on your whole crew's part, and 
thank you very much, and good luck to you.

24:25.237 --> 24:29.383
I can't put this what I thought then on here, but I 
said, oh, God.

24:32.227 --> 24:37.855
He visited me many times, and I worked with him, and 
I just thought he was great. Here one time he was

24:39.057 --> 24:46.949
admonishing me for not doing what I didn't, you 
know, I didn't know what I was doing, but I accepted

24:39.057 --> 24:46.949
that. And then the second time, a little soldier 
does something that's, you're unconscious of him

24:53.097 --> 25:01.626
doing and you and the little soldier all get 
complimented on what the little soldier did. And

25:01.686 --> 25:06.672
I've been complimented so many times on what the 
soldier did that I didn't do. And that makes you a

25:08.414 --> 25:19.105
very humble man and very respectful of the heart 
and mind and the soul of others.

25:23.708 --> 25:28.013
So Georgie was a human being like the rest of us. 
Regardless of how much experience you had or how

25:29.896 --> 25:44.734
old you are, if you're going to do something, if 
you're going to do anything at all, if you're going

25:29.896 --> 25:44.734
to make a contribution in life, you're going to 
make mistakes. And I don't care if you're 90 years

25:46.356 --> 25:50.020
old or you're six months old. That's just exactly 
the way it is. That's a principle. That's a known

25:54.062 --> 25:57.086
part of the art of life. Now, if you do something, 
you're going to make a contribution, one way or the

25:58.707 --> 26:08.698
other. Either it's going to be good or it's going to 
be bad. I think it was Napoleon, a Chinese

26:12.802 --> 26:19.669
philosopher, I can't remember his name, told me 
one time, He learned more from making mistakes

26:21.303 --> 26:26.049
than he did from doing things right.

26:31.615 --> 26:50.517
Now, of course, Patton came into a lot of 
controversy later on in his career when he was in

26:31.615 --> 26:50.517
the hospital in Sicily and slapped that young man 
and also when he was driving into Germany and and

26:51.357 --> 26:58.788
many of the other generals of Eisenhower's staff 
thought that he was trying to grab all the glory at

26:51.357 --> 26:58.788
their expense. And of course, he had a feud with 
Field Marshal Montgomery, too. Were you

27:04.977 --> 27:09.283
involved, or do you have opinions of any of those 
episodes? Well, I was in Sicily during the

27:09.904 --> 27:20.419
slapping incidents, and I was in Normandy before 
Georgie was for the Third Army. you

27:21.327 --> 27:47.436
know you gather information if you're interested 
from those that you see that were present and

27:21.327 --> 27:47.436
hearsay from others and when it's hearsay you 
always question whether it's right or wrong

27:21.327 --> 27:47.436
unless you got the art of Cornelius Ryan, and I 
spent four years on a book and researched back and

27:48.125 --> 28:08.948
forth everything that there is, and you don't, 
you're not writing a book on what's happening,

27:48.125 --> 28:08.948
you're trying to just, for your own interest, find 
out what's happened, so you do get a fair feel, I

27:48.125 --> 28:08.948
think, of generally what's happening. What did 
you, what about the slapping incident here in

28:09.148 --> 28:12.111
Sicily? What was the feeling among the officers 
and the troops? Nobody paid any attention to that

28:15.315 --> 28:18.098
sort of thing. This is all a press explosion. Press 
explosion. Nobody pays any attention to it. You

28:29.113 --> 28:38.322
see, one of the principles that you have in the 
military is that the officer never lays a hand on an

28:29.113 --> 28:38.322
enlisted man.

28:44.909 --> 28:46.431
I can't tell you the million times that I walked up 
and put my arm around a little soldier that had done

28:46.867 --> 29:13.077
a hell of a good job and then pinned a medal on him or 
just walked up and shook hands with him and talked

28:46.867 --> 29:13.077
to him when he's the most lonesome guy in the whole 
battlefield and I know what it does to him and I

28:46.867 --> 29:13.077
violated all rules never lay a hand on a soldier

29:15.892 --> 29:16.953
and they just love it.

29:21.720 --> 29:28.529
I don't condone striking anybody in the military 
and civilian life. What the hell's to be gained

29:28.549 --> 29:31.994
from that? It's a compulsion. It's a driving sense 
of respect for others in the case of Georgie Patton

29:34.558 --> 29:45.713
that he sensed a guy.

29:51.616 --> 30:08.090
that was trying to shirk his duties

29:51.616 --> 30:08.090
when soldiers out there were being killed and 
maimed and lying in the hospital dying. And here's

30:10.012 --> 30:21.522
a whimpering guy sitting over there, by his very 
nature,

30:10.012 --> 30:21.522
may or may not have been able to control his fears.

30:25.042 --> 30:48.268
And Georgie instantaneously,

30:25.042 --> 30:48.268
not,

30:25.042 --> 30:48.268
with a dead sense of

30:25.042 --> 30:48.268
dedication to those that are dead out there, 
slapped this guy with his gloves.

30:51.539 --> 30:52.460
Well, isn't that bad? Yeah, I guess it is. Is it 
worthy of being exploding in the newspaper and so

30:58.209 --> 31:03.276
on and forth? No.

31:07.101 --> 31:19.639
Was it worthy of the condemnation of Georgia 
Patton by Eisenhower and so on and forth?

31:20.193 --> 31:28.182
Eisenhower being a political general, in his 
mind, obviously yes, if you're a politician, if

31:20.193 --> 31:28.182
you're a political general. You see, Mr. 
Eisenhower ducked World War II. He'd never heard a

31:35.010 --> 31:37.052
shot fired in anger.

31:40.756 --> 31:48.225
Georgie won the distinguished service cross with 
a shot up leg on the front end of a an old tank in World

31:48.796 --> 31:50.698
War I. So you got different characters there. 
Bradley, he'd had a little or no combat experience

31:56.663 --> 32:03.429
during World War II.

32:06.531 --> 32:11.095
And same with the rest of them. They were in three 
and four star positions. Georgie had. Georgie was

32:16.059 --> 32:17.841
a combat leader. And that's quite different from 
the staff types. And all that you had sitting at the

32:23.092 --> 32:31.287
top during World War II were the staff types. 
Except Georgie and maybe one or maybe two others.

32:36.617 --> 32:39.542
And I can't think of who the others might be right at 
the moment.

32:49.883 --> 32:53.767
He has received criticism that he pushed his men 
too hard. What about that? Soldiers, American,

32:58.272 --> 33:10.245
red-blooded American soldiers, you can't push 
them too hard

32:58.272 --> 33:10.245
because they like the challenge. They like the 
adventure and like the challenge, and they were

33:10.286 --> 33:18.895
born with it, and by God, they want it there, and you 
can't give them too much to do. I always looked at it

33:19.853 --> 33:24.318
this way. Don't expect them to go beyond their 
capability, and you've got to make a judgment on

33:24.358 --> 33:29.583
their capability. It's like closing off the 
Aurora Pocket in January, I guess it was, of 1945.

33:41.816 --> 33:44.819
We went five days and five nights without any 
sleep. Nobody complained about that. sure tank

33:48.912 --> 34:18.683
crews would go to sleep or you'd stop if they 
weren't in action and all the actions up front and

33:48.912 --> 34:18.683
they'd get ready to move somebody had to go those 
that weren't totally involved in the battle you

33:48.912 --> 34:18.683
had to go wake them up well you'd say what are you 
doing right there no you don't do that say look get

33:48.912 --> 34:18.683
going here damn it stay up let's get up go get going

33:48.912 --> 34:18.683
um Well, did I push them too hard or did the division 
commander push me too hard? That doesn't ever

34:28.841 --> 34:30.984
enter anybody's mind. That never really enters 
anybody's mind. I don't think you can be pushed too

34:38.694 --> 34:42.078
hard. There's an inspiring thing about battle to 
succeed and you always look to the leader because

34:42.098 --> 34:50.509
he's the oldest

34:53.290 --> 35:21.711
you would you hope with the most judgment and most 
wisdom and uh you know when you're 25 years old and

34:53.290 --> 35:21.711
you command 3,000 people I guess I was the oldest

34:53.290 --> 35:21.711
uh as little judgment and wisdom as I had I guess I 
was the oldest everybody looked I know my sergeant

34:53.290 --> 35:21.711
major was 19 with one year out of University of 
Tennessee and his name is Rip Thornton. He's CPA

35:27.269 --> 35:28.470
now. And he is absolutely phenomenal because my 
sergeant major got killed on the beach in Normandy

35:29.312 --> 35:40.387
who had about 15 years service. What a heck of a guy. 
I had no one. You don't get replacements for those

35:46.235 --> 35:48.399
people. So I just took my clerk who had what we 
called T-4 back in those days. He'd be a buck

35:59.982 --> 36:04.407
sergeant now, 19 years old. You're the sergeant 
major. If you haven't learned from him, the dead

36:08.232 --> 36:16.422
one, I said, you and I will make a few mistakes 
together. He said, Roger that, sir. So we went on

36:20.628 --> 36:21.769
with it. Now let's go back to North Africa. Tell me 
about your campaign now. North Africa was a

36:29.118 --> 36:39.253
disaster. The whole campaign in North Africa 
started out as kind of after the landing. After the

36:46.775 --> 36:59.651
Second Armored Division and the Ninth Infantry 
Division landed down at Puerto Leote and Safi and

36:46.775 --> 36:59.651
took Casablanca, they went to Cork Forest and 
retrained there. We fought the French for three

36:59.691 --> 37:01.574
days. The French finally gave up. And then— 
Actually, you were in combat with the French? With

37:09.844 --> 37:10.405
the French, yeah. You fought the hell out of them, 
yeah. Really? Oh, yeah. Three days. Mm-hmm. So

37:15.277 --> 37:20.783
they get capitulated on the 11th of November. You 
got to understand, I was not there. I was down in

37:25.028 --> 37:29.373
another census or something. But I got there 
immediately after that and went back to my

37:30.314 --> 37:39.124
regiment in 67.

37:41.872 --> 37:43.034
was the 68th. When it started out, we reorganized 
and we ended up with two regiments. We just had a

37:47.139 --> 37:57.252
66th and a 67th regiment because the 68th was a 
light tank regiment and we split it up amongst the

37:47.139 --> 37:57.252
other two medium regiments. Because we just had so 
damn many tanks, you couldn't handle them all in

37:57.273 --> 38:00.777
the division. So how many were you in charge of? I 
was in charge of, at the end of the war. No, right at

38:08.167 --> 38:09.208
the beginning. Oh, 17. Okay. Seventeen. Three 
platoons of five inch in each and two in the

38:12.565 --> 38:16.609
headquarters. Okay. And you usually rode in the 
first one? Rode in the first tank. Yeah, company

38:22.355 --> 38:23.356
commander tank. Okay. And then you uh—after

38:23.997 --> 38:33.146
the— Where was the first action that you saw? Up in 
Tunisia.

38:38.211 --> 38:40.313
The background on that is— The 1st

38:42.520 --> 38:52.271
Armored Division and the 1st Infantry Division 
had landed at Oran, Algiers. Simultaneously with

38:53.612 --> 39:07.027
the 2nd Armored and the 9th Infantry landing down 
at Casablanca and taking Casablanca.

39:07.047 --> 39:11.532
The High Command was worried about

39:13.132 --> 39:23.046
We were in French Morocco and we had the other 
Morocco there, Spanish Morocco. We didn't know

39:24.848 --> 39:29.955
which way the Spanish were going to go and they'd 
been playing footsie with the Germans. A lot of

39:30.035 --> 39:34.802
Germans down there in Spanish Morocco and we 
thought that they were going to try pull some kind

39:35.120 --> 39:48.633
of leg up and sabotage the deal to bust our supply 
lines against Rommel's forces over there in the

39:35.120 --> 39:48.633
8th Army, British 8th

39:35.120 --> 39:48.633
Army. Meantime, the 1st Infantry and the 1st 
Armored go through Algiers into Tunisia, and

39:48.653 --> 39:58.183
they're up at Kasserine Pass in the general area. 
Had a corps commander named General Friedenthal

40:04.853 --> 40:20.316
His performance along with the 1st Armored 
Division commander's performance was not

40:04.853 --> 40:20.316
to the high command's liking and wasn't 
acceptable to anybody, so they both were

40:04.853 --> 40:20.316
relieved. Meantime, Georgie, they had a hell of a 
lot of losses, tank losses.

40:32.731 --> 40:43.524
Georgie still commanded the Western Task Force,

40:32.731 --> 40:43.524
which was the second arm of the 9th Army Division. 
General Ernie Harmon had the

40:43.544 --> 40:50.833
second Army Division at the time. Georgie was 
selected to go take that second corps under

40:50.853 --> 40:56.680
Kasserine Pies. And doing so, he took tank units 
and officers with him, kind of borrowed them out of

40:57.892 --> 41:14.877
the 2nd Armored Division to go up there to 
reestablish until they could get replacements,

40:57.892 --> 41:14.877
get tanks, and that sort of stuff, because he had to 
get on it. And that's how I got involved up there.

41:18.222 --> 41:22.348
And so you were one of the ones that he took. And then 
I ended up at Berzerdi. at the end of the war. The

41:27.999 --> 41:33.645
rest of the Second Armored Division was preparing 
for Sicilian operation. But that's where you met

41:33.665 --> 41:37.108
Rommel, up at the Kasserine Pass? No, I fought some 
of his units. I had met him. Yeah, that's where I

41:41.252 --> 41:43.334
went. You fought some of his units? Yeah. Now would 
you comment on the quality of Rommel's tank

41:46.978 --> 41:54.325
commanders?

41:54.727 --> 41:58.131
I guess they're the best soldiers that I've ever 
fought against. They're not as tenacious

42:00.354 --> 42:04.879
as the Communists. I don't know what the 
Communists do to their soldiers, but the tenacity

42:07.001 --> 42:16.392
of them is pretty damn effective, pretty strong. A 
German soldier, he had a warrior. like American.

42:26.059 --> 42:36.450
When he's totally surrounded, he doesn't fight 
the last man and that sort of crap.

42:36.470 --> 42:40.275
I haven't seen many American units do that either. 
There's no hatred, I don't believe, among

42:42.357 --> 42:46.322
soldiers. In other words, your men didn't hate the 
Germans that much? They sort of respected them as

42:51.788 --> 42:53.590
soldiers? Yeah, you've got to respect them or 
they're going to kick hell out of you. You know what

42:57.471 --> 42:58.593
I'm talking about? You've got to respect their 
capabilities. And by God, they better respect

43:02.537 --> 43:07.163
yours, too, or he'll get his damn clock cleaned. So 
that's the way it is amongst warriors, you know. No

43:10.967 --> 43:13.270
question about it. Hell, you know, you don't hate 
the enemy as a person. Much dislike as I have for

43:22.072 --> 43:32.504
communism,

43:22.072 --> 43:32.504
those soldiers out there are people, you know. And 
he's out there under orders to kill you or to do

43:33.885 --> 43:38.330
this, that, and the other. And hopefully someday 
our country will get back to the fact that it won't

43:38.530 --> 43:49.142
be a sin to kill an enemy soldier when you're in 
battle instead of trying to love him to death. That

43:51.265 --> 44:03.823
happens in any country wherein politicians get 
involved in telling generals how in the hell to

43:51.265 --> 44:03.823
fight the battle and what targets he ought to hit 
and that sort of stuff. When you get into that, you

44:03.843 --> 44:13.176
can be criticized for saying to the press that 
you're going to kill the enemy before he gets back

44:03.843 --> 44:13.176
in Cambodia. And you can get criticized to beat 
hell like I did. Well, I was out to destroy the

44:19.919 --> 44:24.704
enemy, and I had to keep them from killing my 
soldiers. Yeah, well, we're going to get to that.

44:26.626 --> 44:31.471
So, tell me about your first contact in battle. 
Well, I guess you're very frightened, but if

44:33.273 --> 44:48.289
you've learned to do everything right during your 
training,

44:33.273 --> 44:48.289
it helps you to overcome your fear as you gain 
confidence. a tremendous amount of confidence by

44:48.877 --> 44:53.484
being successful.

44:55.888 --> 44:56.529
That's the truth. What was the situation at the 
Kasserine's house? The situation was that the

44:58.973 --> 45:07.486
Germans had created a ruse. They had come out to 
attack us. And what they had done was, and which we

45:17.058 --> 45:28.133
couldn't see, was that they were towing anti-tank 
guns behind their tanks. In other words, here

45:29.675 --> 45:38.807
comes about ten tanks, a lot of dust being stirred 
up in the desert, a lot of noise. And you were up on

45:38.927 --> 45:40.869
high ground. I was up on high ground. And I could see 
the ten tanks. Yeah, yeah. And they're coming out

45:44.378 --> 45:47.479
of range. So they...
