00:03.608 --> 00:07.773
You were relating your view of the people of 
Vietnam. How do you feel about the Army of South

00:08.114 --> 00:13.060
Vietnam, the ARVN? Not very well. They weren't 
worth the powder to kill them all with. Some

00:19.107 --> 00:29.880
elitist type units, such as the ARVN Rangers, ARVN 
Special Forces, ARVN SEALs, we had our

00:19.107 --> 00:29.880
counterparts in the ARVN all the way along, were 
fairly good. They were really hardcore trained in

00:32.684 --> 00:35.448
the warrior spirit. You could have pointed them in 
any direction. The enemy wouldn't have mattered.

00:41.256 --> 00:44.361
Just go do, kill, destroy, and they would have done 
it. In that sense, they were okay, but that's not

00:44.381 --> 00:50.530
what wins a war for a nation. It's the support of the 
nation, the people behind it, and so on, such as we

00:50.550 --> 00:54.856
had in World War II. It was a common enemy to the 
whole world. And everyone pulled together more or

01:03.059 --> 01:04.481
less, to win that war. There were a lot of war 
protestors then. The Civil War, the American

01:06.865 --> 01:08.687
Revolutionary War. There was always somebody 
protesting war. That's been going on for

01:12.753 --> 01:17.260
thousands of years, thousands of generations. 
But in World War II, there was a common goal. In

01:20.264 --> 01:21.406
Vietnam, there wasn't. The people of Vietnam did 
not have a common goal, other than they just wanted

01:22.488 --> 01:31.581
to be left alone, grow their rice, raise their kids 
so the kids could grow their rice and raise more

01:22.488 --> 01:31.581
kids. Very simple people. Didn't require a whole 
lot. Very superstitious people. And they

01:37.980 --> 01:44.929
were not ambitious at all. They were bellicose. 
Life meant nothing to them. But to look at them at

01:52.699 --> 01:58.246
the time, they weren't helping me help them. And 
that's all I saw. and I had absolutely no use for

02:00.991 --> 02:04.114
them. That developed over a period of time. Like I 
said, I went in there trying not to be the ugly

02:06.176 --> 02:16.865
American, having lived in several foreign 
countries and traveled Europe and so on and so

02:06.176 --> 02:16.865
forth, and it got along quite well. I learned to 
speak German fairly fluently in the villages and

02:16.985 --> 02:23.971
in the towns, not in the classroom. Gained respect 
and many friends in Germany.

02:28.776 --> 02:30.357
Didn't go to the GI hangout. That's just the way my 
thought pattern is. And I tried the same thing in

02:33.431 --> 02:34.652
Vietnam. It didn't work. It did not work at all. All 
they wanted was everything I had. The Montagnards

02:43.345 --> 02:47.210
of Vietnam I still to this day hold in high esteem. 
They're the mountain people. That's what

02:49.954 --> 02:53.359
Montagnard means. They took it on the chin, even 
from the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese hated it.

02:58.166 --> 02:58.707
Everybody hated it. They were independent 
mountain people. They lived their own lives. They

03:04.390 --> 03:06.292
were ferocious warriors, too. One of the most 
ferocious I ever met was a 13-year-old kid. And he

03:14.942 --> 03:23.591
was the platoon leader of a mercenary force, or 
might force for a special forces operation.

03:23.611 --> 03:27.316
And that's fixing to get off into a war story, and I 
don't tell war stories. But he was a ferocious

03:27.336 --> 03:28.677
fighter. And I gave his body back to his 
grandfather, brought it in on my ship. That's the

03:37.116 --> 03:39.599
kind of people they were. They were, of course, 
primitive, extremely superstitious. Case in

03:45.224 --> 03:58.118
point, I was carrying a med cap team into a 
Montagnard village just to help them out

03:45.224 --> 03:58.118
medicine-wise, inoculate the kids and stuff like 
that, and try and help them out wherever they

03:45.224 --> 03:58.118
could. And that morning, a pair of twins had been 
born. And they were going through the ceremony of

04:01.360 --> 04:08.287
burying these twins alive because they were 
twins. And that was an evil omen. Now, that's how

04:12.131 --> 04:16.055
superstitious and printed they were. We bought 
the twins for a hunting knife and some beads. They

04:24.183 --> 04:27.746
didn't know what money was, but that had no value to 
them. They could use a knife. Oh, yeah, I gave them

04:28.799 --> 04:32.644
some bullets, too, for an AK-47 they had. And some 
shotgun shells. And that's what we bought those

04:37.110 --> 04:39.033
twins with. We turned them over to some 
missionaries. Whatever happened with that, I

04:40.435 --> 04:43.519
don't know. But the Montagnards, I liked those 
people. They knew what they wanted. They knew

04:47.545 --> 04:48.426
where they stood. They were willing to die for it. 
Now, that I respect, but I'm a warrior. And that's

04:53.113 --> 04:55.255
the way I've trained myself to be all my life. Even 
when I was a little kid, that's what I wanted to be.

04:57.908 --> 05:00.171
So that holds the highest esteem for me. At that 
time, in particular, the Vietnamese population

05:00.191 --> 05:08.221
in general weren't that way. The peasants wanted 
to be left alone. They didn't want anything to do

05:11.005 --> 05:14.049
with anybody. The European influenced part of the 
populace was trying to grab anything they could

05:14.950 --> 05:22.720
get. The old How the words of that song go, the old, 
old story, a play for power and glory, something

05:24.773 --> 05:29.478
like that. That's what they were after. It's 
biblical. And it was their downfall. They

05:34.643 --> 05:36.686
destroyed themselves. But they killed a lot of my 
friends in the process.

05:45.355 --> 05:46.076
And that part I did not like. Could you let your view 
of the VC or the VidCon, you know, What you felt they

05:52.651 --> 05:54.754
were fighting for? They were fighting for an idea. 
They had an idea. As I mentioned earlier, the

06:02.066 --> 06:15.388
communists simply told those people and 
demonstrated to them the truth about their own

06:02.066 --> 06:15.388
government, how corrupt it was, and that we were 
adding to that corruption. We were no better than

06:15.428 --> 06:16.650
what they had. This wasn't hard to demonstrate. 
their hard part was to convince the populace that

06:21.811 --> 06:50.873
they were the answer rather than us and they did 
this through some pretty vicious means as far as

06:21.811 --> 06:50.873
fighting us yeah it was pretty dirty and we hated 
them we'd kill them on sight it was they were fair

06:21.811 --> 06:50.873
game but i really had to hand it to them the vc 
mortarmen were the best i ever saw that couple of

06:21.811 --> 06:50.873
guys on the mortar you know untrained unskilled 
but yet trained and skilled farmers by day,

06:51.241 --> 06:54.424
mortarmen by night. They could put ten rounds in 
the air, move the tube, and start ten more before

06:54.444 --> 07:02.953
the first one hit the ground. And be accurate. They 
were really good. But they had an idea that they

07:07.037 --> 07:13.183
wanted to free their country from the yoke of 
colonialism. And we hear it referred to as

07:13.203 --> 07:15.285
imperialism. That's really not. Everything's 
imperialistic. But it was the colonialism that

07:18.268 --> 07:20.370
had oppressed them for so many, many, many years. 
And they had this idea, much like what we had in the

07:25.132 --> 07:37.749
late 1700s, of throwing off a colonial yoke. And 
they believed in it, just like our forefathers

07:37.769 --> 07:40.753
believed in it. And our forefathers were the 
ragtag bunch of ill-fed, ill-equipped, and

07:41.694 --> 07:48.703
untrained people defeated the British Empire. 
beat them into submission until they could not

07:49.966 --> 07:54.412
afford to wage war anymore. The VC did exactly the 
same thing to us.

08:01.562 --> 08:06.108
The saddest part of all this is we haven't learned 
the lesson from it. I recognize it for what it is

08:06.128 --> 08:10.594
now, but then I did not. But I did respect the true VC 
soldier. And the NBA sold. I respected my enemy. I

08:22.719 --> 08:26.304
saw him do a job on us too many times not to. We had 
them overpowered. We were smarter and better

08:28.987 --> 08:32.392
equipped, and we could have outlasted them had we 
had a will to win. We didn't. They did. They have the

08:36.036 --> 08:36.777
country. We don't. They have a lot of the stuff we 
left behind. We don't. They're not as prosperous

08:43.546 --> 08:46.069
as they said they were going to be. In fact, it's a 
disaster. But they got it. And they don't. I

08:52.401 --> 08:57.830
honestly believe that what those people needed 
was what they got. That's what they

08:57.850 --> 09:04.121
understand. Did that answer your question?

09:08.772 --> 09:12.376
We'll shift gears here a bit and talk about 
politics in the United States. When you served in

09:13.157 --> 09:18.704
Vietnam, you served under both President Johnson 
and Nixon. What do you think of their

09:19.125 --> 09:23.670
administrations, their effects on the world, 
their effects on you? Johnson inherited the

09:24.872 --> 09:29.057
Vietnam War from Kennedy. And from what I 
understand now, Kennedy wanted to bail out of it,

09:29.077 --> 09:34.403
but didn't know how to do it gracefully. And then he 
got assassinated, and Johnson inherited the

09:34.443 --> 09:38.188
thing. He made the mistake of believing Wes 
Moreland. He didn't know what to do. And whatever

09:45.927 --> 09:48.371
he did was wrong. Any way he turned was wrong. I got 
real upset and angry with him when he stopped the

09:51.055 --> 10:01.171
bombing along Ho Chi Minh Trail because I was 
directly at the brunt of that stuff and it directly

09:51.055 --> 10:01.171
affected me. And we started getting plastered 
real good because they started getting

10:01.191 --> 10:05.678
resupplied real good. Under Nixon, everything 
was winding down. While I was there on my second

10:11.404 --> 10:20.257
tour, we turned over the big 9th Infantry Division 
facility at Dong Tam to the Vietnamese. This is

10:20.337 --> 10:25.484
going to be another nail in their integrity 
coffin. I flew in there one day on the way to Saigon.

10:28.017 --> 10:30.701
while they were having this ceremony of turning 
the place over. They directed us way out and around

10:30.721 --> 10:35.787
and had to come in an oddball way so that we wouldn't 
disturb them. And we saw it from the air and

10:36.528 --> 10:41.795
remarked about it and made snide remarks and 
yelled and screamed and hollered at them. Of

10:41.815 --> 10:42.696
course, they couldn't hear us. But they had a real 
nice air facility there. Real nice revetments

10:48.244 --> 10:57.636
with solid steel planking, steel posts in the 
ground, dirt three foot thick in it, you know, that

10:48.244 --> 10:57.636
was kind of protected from shrapnel and stuff like 
that. And a real nice refueling facility, a nice

10:58.426 --> 11:04.071
shed there for the operators to get in and out of 
elements. Just a real nice facility. And we came

11:08.015 --> 11:11.118
back through late that afternoon. This was fairly 
early in the morning, about, well, I guess it was

11:11.158 --> 11:20.406
late in the morning, about 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 
something like that. It was fairly late. We'd been

11:22.368 --> 11:23.088
going through daylight. But we came back late that 
afternoon and stopped for fuel again. The place

11:26.792 --> 11:28.213
was stripped bare. There wasn't a piece of metal in 
sight.

11:33.864 --> 11:41.635
While they were turning the facility over to the 
Vietnamese, the soldiers and civilians were out

11:33.864 --> 11:41.635
there stripping it of anything of value. Same 
thing happened with the Navy facility in Bintui.

11:44.539 --> 11:52.190
They were down the street having a ceremony, 
turning it over to them, and the guys were down the

11:44.539 --> 11:52.190
other end of the street taking the urinals and 
toilets out of the building and taking them home so

11:44.539 --> 11:52.190
they could sell it. Some of them didn't even have a 
place to hook it up. They were just taking it. That

11:59.328 --> 12:02.393
led to that, but I'm getting off the subject here. 
Nixon, pretty much in his era, was winding things

12:04.356 --> 12:12.871
down, which I kind of appreciate. I wish he had just 
said, it's over, finished, get on the truck, let's

12:12.891 --> 12:17.338
go home. Well, he took too long in doing it and it 
cost more lives, but finally he declared victory

12:17.358 --> 12:25.572
and we left, which is about the only way we could 
have done it, really. And we all laughed about it

12:26.547 --> 12:28.570
then. We were all sarcastic and cynical about it. 
But in retrospect, that's the only thing he could

12:30.793 --> 12:34.879
have done. Just jumped up and said, we win, and 
left. I just wish he'd have done it sooner. Johnson

12:41.167 --> 12:43.791
I had no use for. Nixon either. We got less for 
Johnson. He could have stopped things, and he

12:46.695 --> 12:50.440
didn't. He made it worse. He could have bailed out, 
but he didn't. And he knew he could have. So much for

12:58.272 --> 13:04.319
politics.

13:04.339 --> 13:11.308
Politics and soldiers make strange bedfellows,

13:04.339 --> 13:11.308
some of us said. You had said something about 
Westmoreland.

13:17.015 --> 13:23.503
How did you see his methods, the strategy that he 
had followed?

13:26.875 --> 13:29.758
Westmoreland did not believe that fraggings were 
going on. He would not accept the fact that drugs

13:30.199 --> 13:35.525
were rampant after 69 and 70 through there. They 
were rampant throughout the military in

13:35.805 --> 13:41.092
Southeast Asia, not just the Army. He wouldn't 
accept it.

13:45.917 --> 13:54.207
A year ago, I listened to Westmoreland give a 
speech in Houston at the gathering of Vietnam

13:45.917 --> 13:54.207
veterans at the Welcome Home Parade they had. I led 
that parade, by the way. Didn't know it when it

13:57.098 --> 14:01.923
happened, but as it turned out, when we got to the 
other end, I said, where's everybody at? And some

14:01.943 --> 14:03.905
guy said, hey, they're all behind us. We're in 
front. I said, ain't that something? And it was all

14:07.169 --> 14:09.111
helicopter pilots. And we led the way, and I 
carried the banner the whole three miles. God, did

14:13.876 --> 14:16.959
my feet hurt. But I listened to him give a speech 
that afternoon against the movie Platoon, which

14:16.979 --> 14:26.329
he admitted at the time he hadn't even seen it. And 
he wanted all of us to write our congressmen and

14:26.815 --> 14:37.771
anybody else of any import to have the thing

14:26.815 --> 14:37.771
done away with. Not to show it. Don't go see it. 
That's censorship. Of the worst kind. He thought

14:45.443 --> 14:47.065
that it was all a bunch of hooey. Well, I know 
better. I did see the movie. I have a tape of the

14:51.813 --> 14:52.854
movie. I've studied the movie. It crammed a lot 
into a little bit of time, but it made more sense

14:56.515 --> 15:03.564
than the other idiotic things that they put out. 
I'm not even talking about Rambo. I don't even

15:05.206 --> 15:07.109
mention that. That's pure bull. But Apocalypse 
Now was an abstract thing, way out on the edges of

15:09.632 --> 15:19.425
believability. But the things that occurred in 
Platoon did happen. People smoked dope. People

15:25.507 --> 15:27.009
shot their leaders in the back. Leaders shot their 
people. Every kind of human emotion that you can

15:31.074 --> 15:42.147
think of comes out in stress situations like 
combat, particularly in combat, particularly

15:31.074 --> 15:42.147
where you've got a gun and people expect you to kill 
something. That happens. When you turn kids loose

15:43.989 --> 15:49.495
like that without good guidance and direction, 
they take so much and they just crack. And they just

15:49.515 --> 15:53.640
start killing anything in sight.

15:54.262 --> 15:56.945
When we were kids, we'd throw rocks at things. 
Their rock was an M-16. So these things did happen.

16:01.690 --> 16:03.792
Westmoreland refused to accept it. He didn't 
believe it and wanted the rest of us not to believe

16:03.812 --> 16:08.297
it. The drug problem became rampant because he 
wouldn't address it. He was telling the Congress

16:12.582 --> 16:18.408
and the President that this was this way and that 
was that way, and it wasn't that way at all. He blew

16:20.691 --> 16:22.733
it on Tet, 68. They caught us with our pants down, 
plain and simple. We came back and did something

16:27.789 --> 16:35.818
about it, but we could have stopped it long before 
it ever started, months before it ever started, if

16:27.789 --> 16:35.818
he'd have only listened to these intelligence 
people. They were telling him that the thing was

16:35.838 --> 16:39.683
going to happen. And he wouldn't accept it. He was 
too much of the old school, too much West Point. Way

16:46.791 --> 16:48.012
too much West Point.

16:53.088 --> 16:55.991
You were saying about Westmoreland and his 
strategies. I mean, how do you feel about the other

16:56.011 --> 17:02.337
officers that you were under? Not very much. On the 
subject of shooting the leaders, I came very close

17:05.580 --> 17:11.005
to it myself. A particular operation that 
happened in the Docto area, Firebase 19. I watched

17:16.250 --> 17:19.152
a lot of people, including my roommate in flight 
school, die that day. I watched the bullets hit his

17:20.674 --> 17:22.015
body. I watched him rip open his fuel tank. He'd 
been shot down in the LZ. He was a medevac pilot. He

17:30.243 --> 17:31.885
was going in trying to rescue people. He got shot 
down, and then he got wounded getting out of the

17:31.905 --> 17:34.488
aircraft. And it was the only cover there, so they 
stayed right there. And I was coming in to get him

17:40.075 --> 17:44.980
until the ship blew up in front of me. And I watched 
the burning fuel spew out over him, and I watched it

17:45.000 --> 17:48.745
fry him. All because this one battalion commander 
advertised for three days exactly where we were

17:50.007 --> 17:57.017
going to land. And he put ordnance artillery 
everywhere but that place. It was the only safe

18:02.425 --> 18:04.288
place for the NVA to be. And they were there when we 
got there. And they hurt us real bad. Hurt us bad. I

18:13.140 --> 18:16.325
come close to killing that battalion commander. I 
believe it's, if I remember correctly,

18:19.707 --> 18:25.474
seven-and-a-half-pound trigger pull on a 
standard issue .45 automatic. I had about three

18:25.494 --> 18:26.896
ounces to go. And my crew chief, a very big 
strapping kid from Pennsylvania, took the gun

18:28.699 --> 18:34.726
away from me, picked me up off the ground, and 
carried me away. Somebody else carried that

18:37.169 --> 18:38.491
colonel away. He couldn't walk. I'd already done 
the job on him. They got him out of country that day

18:42.236 --> 18:47.583
because I wasn't the only one to complain. That 
whole battalion was ready to kill him. for what was

18:49.812 --> 18:53.517
left of them, most of them were dead. So some of 
their operations they planned were just asinine.

18:58.303 --> 19:12.863
They were elaborate wallboard drawings with 
elaborate time schedules and artillery

18:58.303 --> 19:12.863
schedules and things like this that were going to 
get somebody killed if they were so much as 10

18:58.303 --> 19:12.863
seconds off. I was air mission commander one day on 
a particular one of these forces. And I canceled

19:19.782 --> 19:26.810
the entire mission because of the elaboracy of the 
thing. And in the briefing, when it got around to

19:26.970 --> 19:33.678
me, this battalion commander said, who's the air 
mission commander? And I stuck my hand up. I had 13

19:36.161 --> 19:40.646
ships to help me make this assault with. Unlucky 
number, but we liked it that way. It was my call sign

19:42.207 --> 19:46.132
was 13. Gladiator 1-3. He asked me what I thought 
about it. I said, I think your plan stinks, and I'm

19:51.280 --> 19:54.985
not going to use my aircraft to do it. You're going 
to get my people killed. He exploded, ordered me

19:57.609 --> 19:59.932
off the field. We left. My battalion commander 
came in, told him he was crazy. If he'd tell me where

20:03.657 --> 20:08.825
he wanted his troops picked up and where he wanted 
them put, we would do that. But we weren't going to

20:08.845 --> 20:10.827
play his stupid, silly games. So my battalion 
commander was pretty sharp. He backed me up. And we

20:13.852 --> 20:14.412
didn't do it. And the mission was canceled. And it 
would have gotten Probably half of us wiped out

20:18.440 --> 20:24.767
because it was so elaborate no one could keep the 
schedule. It was like 10 second differences. I'm

20:28.731 --> 20:33.656
going to shut the artillery off and 10 seconds 
later we're going to land. They came up with all

20:33.676 --> 20:36.859
kinds of cockamamie things like that. Their whole 
thinking about this was a conventional warfare.

20:40.703 --> 20:45.368
That if we could catch the VC in the open and take him 
on head to head, we could defeat him. That's true,

20:45.468 --> 20:46.489
we could. When I say the VC, I really mean the NVA, 
because that's who we're up against. They

20:52.447 --> 20:53.969
wouldn't meet us head-to-head like that. We'd 
already heard them too many times for them to meet

20:54.069 --> 20:58.576
us head-on, head-to-head. They'd catch us where 
they could and wear us down, just wear us down,

20:58.596 --> 21:06.987
constantly working at us, like dripping water on a 
stone. Sooner or later, it's going to be all of it.

21:11.153 --> 21:18.163
But our commanders wanted to fight a conventional 
war in an unconventional situation and use all

21:11.153 --> 21:18.163
their toys, like the helicopters, the B-52s out of 
Guam, all this stuff, and believe that because of

21:19.156 --> 21:27.965
all this might, we were invincible. I think Gideon 
showed the Amalekites that they weren't. I

21:33.290 --> 21:38.515
believe he had 300, and they had 10,000 or 
something like that. So might is not always right,

21:38.555 --> 21:44.341
but our commanders believed that it was. And they 
were foolish. And they expected us to be fools too.

21:53.248 --> 21:54.731
You said too much West Point. Mm-hmm. You think it 
got too technological to buy the paper. Buy the

22:01.160 --> 22:03.243
paper. Too much West Point. The Klan.

22:09.993 --> 22:11.735
They're still fighting Napoleon's battles. The 
guy I like to lead me is A fella that used to be a loan

22:16.852 --> 22:21.516
officer down at the bank got something to live for. 
He wants to get this damn thing over with and go

22:21.536 --> 22:24.359
home. And the best way to get it over with is to kick 
their butt until they can't be kicked anymore, and

22:25.300 --> 22:31.406
then we win. Pick up the marbles and go. I like those 
kind of people. They're level-headed. They've

22:37.712 --> 22:44.158
got a little savvy about what's right and what's 
wrong, not about what gets them ticket punched and

22:37.712 --> 22:44.158
their career advanced. Ticket punching was the 
order of the day in Vietnam for career senior

22:45.691 --> 22:49.655
officers. Captains were a dime a dozen. I was 
offered direct to first lieutenant several

22:54.961 --> 22:58.845
times, turned it down. If I'd have taken it one year 
later, I'd have been a captain. The congressional

23:03.009 --> 23:08.055
cap on the amount of captains we could have in the 
Army was lifted completely. There was no limit.

23:10.077 --> 23:12.880
They wanted captains to take the heat for 
something. captain is exactly the right level.

23:16.243 --> 23:17.285
He's a company commander. We're not going to risk 
our West Point lieutenant colonel or major when we

23:18.867 --> 23:29.783
can get some OCS captain or direct commission guy 
in there that was a lone officer in the bank back

23:18.867 --> 23:29.783
home. Stuff like this or just was in the wrong place 
at the wrong time and got made a captain. Those are

23:35.932 --> 23:36.914
the guys I'll follow. Those are the guys I'd love to 
lead. That's most of what I have, which is plain GI

23:40.119 --> 23:43.744
Joe Nothing fancy. They just wanted to get over 
with it and go home. You said G.I. Joe's. How much of

23:54.798 --> 24:03.547
a difference do you think there were between the 
professional soldiers like yourself and the

23:54.798 --> 24:03.547
selective service? The draftees? The best 
soldiers I ever met. They kept us old pros in line.

24:10.333 --> 24:12.195
The ones I always had the most trouble with, where 
the kids that enlisted asked for it and didn't

24:13.255 --> 24:25.387
really realize what they were getting into and 
weren't mature enough to accept what they had

24:13.255 --> 24:25.387
stumbled into. The draftee, he was there to do his 
time, get it over with, and go home. As far as that

24:30.392 --> 24:37.940
goes in Vietnam, once it got to a point, everybody 
was the same. Of course, the professional

24:38.761 --> 24:41.203
hardcore like myself We just kept on keeping on. 
And it boiled down to just basic leadership. Could

24:48.302 --> 24:49.423
you get along with people? Could you get them to do 
what you wanted them to do? Rank and authority only

24:52.627 --> 24:54.789
went so far. It was just a hand grenade away from not 
having any existence at all. So it was real obvious

25:01.296 --> 25:10.887
to me, having come up through the ranks, a Mustang, 
and having been a sergeant, first-line leader and

25:11.322 --> 25:17.387
things like that, that you don't just tell people 
what to do. That's not leadership. You've got to

25:19.589 --> 25:20.851
work with them. You've got to be there with them. 
You've got to take the same risks, sleep in the same

25:22.492 --> 25:31.360
mud, eat the same rotten grub, or don't eat it. And I 
never ate unless my crew was fed first. Never. And

25:39.768 --> 25:41.329
out of that, I got their loyalty And there were 
times when I asked them to do things that were

25:42.136 --> 25:49.925
literally impossible, but they did it. And they 
always

25:49.945 --> 25:57.313
came through for me. And I brought

25:57.333 --> 26:01.077
them all home. The spectrum of the war just totally 
covered, affected the United States so much. you

26:09.254 --> 26:12.878
know, the anti-war protests and stuff. And my 
next, you know, line of questions were going to

26:12.898 --> 26:23.087
cover the media involvement in it, and what you saw 
their effect was.

26:23.908 --> 26:24.449
Far away. I mean, what overall do you think the, how 
did the media affect the war? Very much so. When you

26:33.017 --> 26:34.879
say the media, that's the plural. Newspapers, 
television, radio, the whole nine yards. For the

26:39.781 --> 26:53.181
first time in the history of the world, you had a war 
a world away in your living room, literally hours

26:39.781 --> 26:53.181
after it occurred, on television, in living 
color. And uncensored. They could say and do

26:54.623 --> 26:56.345
anything they wanted to do. It'd be incredible to 
think about it right now with satellite

26:58.649 --> 27:02.474
capability that we didn't have then. My God, you 
could be right in the middle of a battle as it is

27:03.596 --> 27:06.480
occurring. This is a live report from the front. 
We're going to John Jones up there, and he's

27:09.314 --> 27:14.058
getting shot at even as we speak. We could do that 
now. It was almost that then. And every night it was

27:19.443 --> 27:21.105
the same thing. One of the things that turned most 
of us military against the media, the

27:21.305 --> 27:30.313
professional corps, was the fact that they 
weren't on our side. What we didn't realize was why

27:30.593 --> 27:33.997
they weren't on our side. We didn't know. We did not 
have a plan to win. They knew it. And they took

27:40.017 --> 27:48.106
incidents like the police chief in Saigon 
summarily executing a guy on the street and I'm not

27:40.017 --> 27:48.106
going to judge one way or the other. Stuff happens 
and it happens fast. But they took things like that

27:52.071 --> 27:55.775
and they hit people with it. I objected greatly to 
their reports of Tet 68. They were reporting

28:00.200 --> 28:07.028
literally within hours of occurrence getting it 
on some sort of a feedback to the states that we were

28:07.447 --> 28:10.570
losing the war. In fact, we were winning. One of the 
things that they failed to mention after they had

28:14.173 --> 28:37.015
said all the horrible, ugly things we'd done and 
all the people we'd killed in the Waifu Bay area,

28:14.173 --> 28:37.015
they seemed to have neglected to remember that the 
NVA and the VC infrastructure that came in there

28:14.173 --> 28:37.015
executed 5,000 to 8,000 people in a period of about 
a week or so. or a month, I don't know exactly how

28:37.568 --> 28:40.991
long ago. I've got the figures in one of my 
references. But executed these people because

28:45.495 --> 28:51.161
they were teachers, lawyers, they were leaders in 
the community and things like that. Literally

28:51.461 --> 28:55.044
executed them and buried them in a mass grave. They 
never really brought all that out. They were just

28:58.608 --> 29:00.289
after our own people. That disturbed us greatly. I 
had some personal dealings with... television

29:06.695 --> 29:09.538
crew and reporters. And their arrogance was 
beyond mine. And that was pretty bad. I was pretty

29:16.625 --> 29:18.807
arrogant. I was a shit-hot jet-jumper.

29:22.631 --> 29:24.613
And I couldn't be killed. Well, I earned mine. They 
just did theirs. I didn't like them at all. I still

29:31.260 --> 29:36.685
don't like the way they portray things, but 
through them I learned a lot of the truths of what

29:31.260 --> 29:36.685
really went on. what was going on behind the scenes 
in the Congress, in the executive branch, the

29:37.525 --> 29:47.637
things that affected me out there at Contum Army 
Airfield. But I still don't like the way they did

29:47.657 --> 29:50.060
it. They tend to blow things out of proportion. And 
they put it in everybody's living room, and they

29:52.483 --> 30:00.052
helped cut us down.

30:03.576 --> 30:05.799
I don't think they really knew they were doing it, 
though. You get right down to it. It borders on

30:08.609 --> 30:12.314
aiding and abetting the enemy, but I don't think 
they knew they were doing it. They didn't mean to,

30:12.334 --> 30:15.959
and I believe they did that for a second. But they 
could have done a better job for the grunt. Rather

30:20.445 --> 30:28.455
than trying to stop the war strategically, they 
could have helped in supporting our efforts. And

30:29.497 --> 30:34.363
we know now how important that was to the North 
Vietnamese government. was they knew that we did

30:35.002 --> 30:40.590
not have the popular support, therefore they 
continued to press the point. Just like the

30:40.610 --> 30:56.973
neighborhood bully, if he knows you're not going 
to hit him and fight back, he's going to pick on you

30:40.610 --> 30:56.973
even more until he gets the indication that you're 
going to hurt him bad and that you have the rest of

30:40.610 --> 30:56.973
the neighborhood's support. As long as the 
neighborhood's not going to stop him, he's going

30:57.053 --> 31:00.638
to continue to push everybody around. But as soon 
as the neighborhood stands up and says, we're not

31:02.710 --> 31:09.561
taking any of this anymore off you, butch, he's 
going down.

31:13.007 --> 31:15.210
The same rule applies. They didn't help us. They 
did hurt us. And I did not like them. And I still

31:19.597 --> 31:23.043
don't like them. You were married throughout this 
time. I mean, that must have had...

31:30.419 --> 31:35.245
a devastating effect on your family back home, 
seeing this on television. Yes, it did. I mean, how

31:38.148 --> 31:39.590
did you see that? My children were quite small. My 
son, who was the youngest, was born in 1971, just

31:43.355 --> 31:49.362
before I went back to my second tour. My oldest 
daughter was born before I went back to Germany the

31:49.422 --> 31:54.488
second time. My youngest daughter was born five 
days before I graduated from flight school.

32:02.347 --> 32:03.588
They're Vietnam veterans, too. I didn't realize 
that until just a few years ago. And to give them the

32:08.995 --> 32:16.183
credit for it, they've had to live with the effect 
of what happened to me and what happened in those

32:08.995 --> 32:16.183
days. My daughters were too young to realize what 
they were seeing on the news. I don't think they

32:19.166 --> 32:20.908
even watched it, but my wife did. And I showed you my 
map on the wall. That was her map. And she surmised

32:26.114 --> 32:28.958
where I was at. I wouldn't tell her. She finally 
figured it out. And it was while I was home on that

32:33.025 --> 32:42.677
unauthorized R&R back to the States for my 
daughter's birthday, my unit had been hit pretty

32:33.025 --> 32:42.677
bad in a night attack. And the news just said a 
helicopter base north of Pleiku. And when he did, I

32:47.784 --> 32:51.529
jerked around in my chair. And at that moment, my 
wife knew where it was. She said, I knew it. It's a

32:57.617 --> 32:58.017
contoon. Well, I think on it now, how did she do it i 
knew what was going on with me i was there and i had a

33:03.012 --> 33:31.669
little bit of control over what happened to me i 
could elect not to go into an area if i wanted to and i

33:03.012 --> 33:31.669
was in control of my aircraft and i knew when to zig 
and zag all she could do was sit and wait for some guy

33:03.012 --> 33:31.669
to drive up in front of the house in a uniform and 
walk slowly up the walk and knock at the door. I

33:37.000 --> 33:42.605
think about that now, and I think how much stronger 
she is than I am. I couldn't have done that. I

33:44.947 --> 33:47.209
couldn't have sat still for it. I would have gone 
nuts. But she did it, day in and day out, for two

33:49.111 --> 33:54.036
tours. And then she put up with what was left over 
for all these years since then. And she stayed by me

34:01.822 --> 34:05.606
through all of it. And it got pretty bad for a while. 
She talked me out of a divorce three times. Quite a

34:12.474 --> 34:13.015
gal. Not the most glamorous thing in the world, but 
her loyalty knows no end. And I still wonder why she

34:21.424 --> 34:24.168
stuck with me. I'm no prize. But it did have a great 
effect on her. And a lot of all the veterans'

34:30.577 --> 34:33.560
families. I lost my family because of the war. My 
own mother called me a baby killer and a murderer.

34:42.669 --> 34:44.050
To this day, I don't know where she's at. After my 
father died, she sold everything and left. Just

34:48.735 --> 34:50.256
picked up and took off. And I haven't seen her 
since. Don't even know where she's at. But they

35:00.040 --> 35:03.504
turned against me. Even my dad didn't want that 
much to do with me anymore. The one uncle that was in

35:07.488 --> 35:14.937
Europe in World War II, in the infantry, he's the 
only one that I ever get along with anymore. And we

35:14.957 --> 35:15.978
don't talk about it. It's just that we know. And 
it's enough that we know. So it devastated the

35:21.564 --> 35:23.667
families. Many families didn't survive it.

35:28.053 --> 35:31.678
And there's a poem out, it's a rather long one, by a 
guy named Steve Mason. No. Steve Mason wrote the

35:36.464 --> 35:40.248
book Chicken House. A fellow named Mason. And he 
addresses that, the wall within, the name of the

35:42.091 --> 35:45.215
poem. I can't even begin to quote it. But some of the 
things that he points out in this, they go right to

35:48.559 --> 35:53.205
the heart of it. How many long-distance telephone 
callers were there? How many The kids got a good

35:59.626 --> 36:05.192
stepdad out of the deal. Did their Vietnam veteran 
father not love them? No. He loved them too much to

36:09.017 --> 36:11.579
stay around and hurt them anymore. He couldn't 
stand the pain anymore. The effect on the families

36:13.882 --> 36:17.346
was enormous, incredible. And those families 
that did survive, survival of the fittest. Those

36:23.473 --> 36:28.198
families that didn't, it's difficult for me to 
condemn them anymore. I used to because I was

36:28.870 --> 36:35.017
ignorant and didn't know any

36:28.870 --> 36:35.017
better. But to finally realize what they had to put 
up with and the enormity of it, I can have a better

36:35.037 --> 36:43.246
understanding for it. I'm extremely fortunate. 
My old gal has stuck by me through thick and thin.

36:49.753 --> 36:55.519
And I don't know of any other woman that I know, and I 
know of a lot of them, that would have done that. I

36:57.473 --> 37:01.418
know of none that can compare to her. And when I 
think of heroes, she's mine. When I think of

37:06.445 --> 37:16.239
character and integrity, she's the example.

37:16.279 --> 37:24.831
How do you feel, because you were talking about 
your uncle before World War II, how do you feel, I

37:16.279 --> 37:24.831
mean, the Vietnam War seems... so different from 
the rest of them. It wasn't as popular. Well,

37:31.939 --> 37:33.061
that's the key word. Popular. What's popular? A 
common goal. We didn't have a common goal. I think

37:39.330 --> 37:52.790
initially that they were radicals that were just 
against the government, and that happened to be

37:39.330 --> 37:52.790
the event of the day, and they picked up on it. I 
don't put anything past the communists. They'll

37:56.232 --> 38:03.642
take advantage of any situation they can, any way 
they can, especially if they can get somebody else

37:56.232 --> 38:03.642
to take the rap for them. And I've seen it too many 
times all over the world, every place I've ever

38:03.662 --> 38:11.633
been. They got in there and got it stirred up too.

38:17.240 --> 38:20.164
But here we had this faction that was saying, no, 
it's wrong. this is, you know, we're trying to

38:20.498 --> 38:24.523
impose our will upon a government. In fact, we're 
trying to establish a government outside the

38:24.543 --> 38:27.826
government. And they were right. Only we couldn't 
believe something like that was possible in this

38:29.869 --> 38:33.733
country. But it was. And it was happening. These 
young radicals, many of them recognize it, tried

38:38.078 --> 38:43.244
to tell the rest of us the truth. We wouldn't listen 
because we were too caught up in our old ways. We had

38:46.067 --> 38:48.109
been taught ways for Had the wisdom of generations 
before us pounded into us from birth. You get a job,

38:54.253 --> 38:59.281
you settle down, you work hard, you raise your 
kids, you go to church, you do whatever you want.

38:59.301 --> 39:00.703
And this is the way you do it. This is the American 
way. And that's the way we believe it should be. The

39:06.832 --> 39:08.654
good guys win. And so on and so forth. But it wasn't 
that way. At all. And we wouldn't listen. So we lost

39:17.637 --> 39:19.640
the popularity. There was no common goal. For us to 
help that country defeat the communists, no, that

39:23.105 --> 39:33.061
was a convenient thing for us to take on the 
communists, head to head, try out some new ideas

39:23.105 --> 39:33.061
and weapon systems and so on. Had it been for that, 
the helicopter wouldn't have gotten the

39:33.441 --> 39:37.527
development that it realizes today. It would 
still be in its infant stages.

39:43.537 --> 39:45.720
So the popularity is what we lack. There was no 
Hitler. There was no Hirohiko. Ho Chi Minh was an

39:49.466 --> 39:53.672
abstract thing. Like the guy said, it was a dirty, 
nasty little war, but it was the only one us

39:53.692 --> 40:00.822
professionals had to fight, and by God, we were 
going to fight it. It was the only one they'd let us

40:00.842 --> 40:03.866
fight, and we wanted to fight it. We're scrappers. 
That's why we do this stuff.

40:09.233 --> 40:14.560
So the difference between World War II and 
Vietnam, look at Korea, the same thing. It was an

40:15.333 --> 40:16.655
unpopular war. But the convention of the day, 
people just didn't do that, like what happened in

40:17.796 --> 40:38.059
68 and 67 and 69, the riots and the Chicago 7, the 
bombings of university ROTC departments and

40:17.796 --> 40:38.059
computers and stuff like that. The convention of 
the day wouldn't allow things like that, World War

40:38.079 --> 40:42.184
II, Korea. The new age, the age of Aquarius that 
came into the 60s, the openness, that allowed it to

40:43.295 --> 40:52.283
happen. Everybody wanted to throw off the 
shackles of the old stoic establishment. And a lot

40:57.487 --> 41:00.670
of us knew that if you did that, it would be chaos. 
And it was. I like to think that something good came

41:03.773 --> 41:09.918
out of the whole mess, but I hate to think that 
nothing did. But we did not have the popular

41:09.938 --> 41:12.340
support of the people. the VC did. Now that ought to 
tell future leaders and future generations

41:17.221 --> 41:22.968
something. You don't have the population behind 
you. You're nowhere. And we were trying to win

41:28.716 --> 41:41.132
their hearts and minds by blowing them

41:28.716 --> 41:41.132
up. Do you feel that the I mean, going back to the 
question of the media, do you feel that the media

41:43.488 --> 41:52.822
was a...

41:52.842 --> 41:54.945
Contributing factor? Or was a contributing 
factor to the riots and the anti-war? They were a

41:58.490 --> 41:59.932
contributing factor, and that's all. Or do you 
think that it was the other way around? I think

42:05.019 --> 42:12.330
after a certain point during the late 60s, they 
each began to feed upon each other. The media saw

42:13.475 --> 42:30.954
the riots, showed it, advertised it, populized 
it, and then the riots took advantage of the media,

42:13.475 --> 42:30.954
just like the terrorists of the late 70s and early 
80s did. If they wouldn't get the media coverage,

42:30.974 --> 42:41.625
they wouldn't have any reason to do anything 
because they would not be believing that they were

42:30.974 --> 42:41.625
held in such popularity. all the terrorist 
activities in the late 70s and early 80s, every one

42:43.360 --> 42:49.508
of them said, we want TV coverage. Well, it began to 
feed on itself. Now the media has become the victim

42:52.892 --> 42:56.217
of it. But that's their problem. Do you think there 
was any condemnation? I mean, was the media more

43:03.907 --> 43:08.693
radical because of the feelings in the United 
States? There's an old adage in... News reporting

43:12.031 --> 43:16.797
is if there's not any news, go make some. And 
they're all guilty of that. And they admit it. I've

43:19.981 --> 43:21.724
heard them admit it dozens of times. They all know 
that. It boils down to the responsibility in

43:22.925 --> 43:26.610
reporting. Where do you go? How far do you go? What 
are you trying to say? Are you just trying to get

43:29.754 --> 43:33.019
better ratings, sell more newspapers, and so on 
and so forth? Especially television news

43:33.039 --> 43:38.766
reporting, they're after ratings, period, 
advertising dollars. That's mercenary, the

43:38.786 --> 43:41.650
worst kind of mercenary as far as I'm concerned. 
And the more spectacular thing that they can come

43:42.811 --> 43:52.361
up with, the better their rating is going to be. And 
they have ways of judging and engaging in this that

43:52.381 --> 43:57.767
are accurate. Really accurate.

44:01.330 --> 44:03.132
Accurate enough to sell advertising. 
Multi-million dollar packages, which is what

44:03.152 --> 44:06.075
they're after. It's a business. But it's business 
creates chaos. Shifting a bit to the anti-war

44:11.735 --> 44:25.530
protests, you

44:11.735 --> 44:25.530
were saying, I've kind of picked from what you're 
saying, that there's mainly like two reasons.

44:25.610 --> 44:35.721
It's said that the 50s were a silent generation, 
and it seems that the 60s just seem to be tired of

44:25.610 --> 44:35.721
this.

44:37.583 --> 44:41.067
Why do you think they were anti-war protests to 
begin with? It started out as a legitimate thing.

44:47.078 --> 44:52.406
And from what I see now, looking back on it now, at 
the time I didn't know all this stuff because I was

44:47.078 --> 44:52.406
basically uneducated.

44:55.591 --> 44:58.897
Highly motivated, sincere, but stupid. 
Ignorant. But looking back on it now, the kids

45:01.701 --> 45:08.893
coming out of the 50s into the 60s, coming up behind 
me, they had had all of the depression, war

45:09.937 --> 45:16.724
stories, and stuff like that, that they were going 
to take and say, hey, this is mine, I'm taking hold

45:09.937 --> 45:16.724
of it. And the whole world opened up before them. 
Things changed rapidly. Attitudes, the whole

45:21.308 --> 45:23.930
nine yards. The Timothy Leary's came on the scene, 
and they started preaching their gospel. Free

45:28.575 --> 45:31.878
love and cheap drugs, so on and so forth. Everybody 
had to try it. People forgot how to handle the

45:33.600 --> 45:38.104
stress that came into their lives. I don't 
remember in the 50s of things being stressful like

45:39.299 --> 45:44.083
this. Leads right on into the recent times, such as 
up in Dallas several years ago, when suicides were

45:44.123 --> 45:59.238
the rule of the day of teenage kids in school, in 
high school, committing suicide because they

45:44.123 --> 45:59.238
couldn't take it anymore, couldn't take the 
pressure. Really weird. So that all started back

45:59.698 --> 46:06.184
in the early 60s, and it just, a door opened like a 
Pandora's box. And once the flood started, it

46:07.328 --> 46:14.378
ripped out all the doorposts and reinforcements 
and it was wide open. So it began to feed upon

46:14.398 --> 46:16.401
itself. And the bigger it got, the more people 
jumped into it because it was so large they could be

46:17.442 --> 46:31.462
anonymous and still express themselves 
physically. That's my understanding of it. It may

46:33.065 --> 46:36.930
be way out in left field, but it helps me forgive 
them if they have anything to be forgiven for. And

46:41.975 --> 46:44.680
that takes the pressure off of me. Because the 
whole thing was so enormous that no amount of

46:44.700 --> 46:54.335
avenging would ever wipe away its damage. Only 
forgiveness would wipe it off. It takes all the

46:57.861 --> 46:58.682
pressure off of me.
