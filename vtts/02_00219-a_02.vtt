00:01.381 --> 00:03.803
Let's go back to family.

00:04.644 --> 00:10.610
Your children went to A&M Consolidated, and you felt comfortable with that school system.

00:11.691 --> 00:12.772
Were you all church goers?

00:13.252 --> 00:13.713
Not really.

00:14.273 --> 00:14.974
I never was.

00:15.254 --> 00:20.599
I was born and raised a Roman Catholic, but I never was serious about it.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.521
And my wife's a Methodist.

00:22.621 --> 00:23.942
I married her in a Methodist church.

00:24.923 --> 00:30.088
And I tell you, to me, the most boring hour is 11 o'clock on Sunday morning.

00:31.334 --> 00:38.404
I mean I don't get any spiritual satisfaction out of that.

00:38.424 --> 00:38.945
But that's me.

00:39.485 --> 00:46.275
That's just, it is I. Where did you and family travel for fun, for vacation?

00:47.957 --> 00:49.520
You don't mean when I was a kid.

00:49.580 --> 00:51.002
No, no, no.

00:51.022 --> 00:52.043
You and your wife and children.

00:52.924 --> 00:55.468
Well since I had family in New York we'd go there.

00:55.820 --> 01:04.719
We, my daughters, one went to Tulane, the other one went to Rice, so we went to New Orleans quite often, quite often.

01:05.540 --> 01:11.974
She has family up in Utah and we go up there quite regularly, very pleasant.

01:12.134 --> 01:14.419
She's a Mormon actually, her cousin.

01:15.462 --> 01:23.475
But a pleasant visit, the only problem I had, not being able to get a Coke or a cup of coffee at Brigham Young, but other than that's no problem.

01:23.495 --> 01:26.560
Countryside's beautiful.

01:27.401 --> 01:32.289
I have relatives in California and San Francisco area, we go there.

01:33.631 --> 01:35.194
So we've gone around quite a bit.

01:35.234 --> 01:38.239
Do you have any avocation, hobbies?

01:38.920 --> 01:40.963
Yeah I've become a fairly

01:41.197 --> 01:44.723
I wouldn't say serious, but good stamp collector.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.768
I used to take great pictures.

01:48.109 --> 01:52.316
I was a really good photographer and I haven't been able to do as well as when I was a youngster.

01:52.737 --> 01:56.083
What, in stamp collecting, what are your specials?

01:56.103 --> 01:56.984
Just U.S.

01:57.766 --> 02:01.332
I collect foreign ones, but these are just ones that people who do my work give me.

02:01.750 --> 02:02.851
and letters I get.

02:02.951 --> 02:05.554
I spend no money on foreign stamps.

02:05.574 --> 02:15.043
But if you were showing your collection to a very well-informed philatelist, what would be the prize?

02:15.243 --> 02:17.505
Oh yeah, I've got a good one.

02:17.525 --> 02:20.568
I had a friend in graduate school at the University of Kansas.

02:20.928 --> 02:24.532
Like I said, there was a lot of military people after the war.

02:24.552 --> 02:27.775
This fellow was a Filipino officer.

02:28.767 --> 02:42.461
And he presented me with a set of stamps that were overcharges of the Japanese stamps, some kind of a freedom stamp on that.

02:43.041 --> 02:50.949
And I've got about four or five of those envelopes covered with these freedom stamps, liberation stamps, I forget.

02:51.570 --> 02:55.534
But I showed these to a real serious stamp collector, a man you know.

02:55.514 --> 02:59.901
Phillips, Clint Phillips, who told me they are really valuable.

02:59.921 --> 03:01.303
Are these from the Philippines?

03:01.323 --> 03:04.749
They're from the Philippines, yeah.

03:04.849 --> 03:11.720
Other than that, I've got a huge collection of first day covers going back to the 40s.

03:13.102 --> 03:17.870
And I've got them all now very, very well organized.

03:17.910 --> 03:20.374
That's one of the things I've done while I've been retired.

03:21.417 --> 03:24.583
But you're retired but you still come to campus.

03:24.603 --> 03:26.627
Well I've still got a research project.

03:27.488 --> 03:32.297
And like I told you I'm hoping it turns out to be the star in my crown.

03:32.558 --> 03:34.702
Normally you're here about how much?

03:35.083 --> 03:37.367
Oh I get in about 9.30 to 10.

03:38.967 --> 03:41.090
I go home about 1230.

03:41.270 --> 03:43.473
I eat some lunch, usually very light.

03:43.593 --> 03:45.255
Then I take a nap for an hour.

03:45.295 --> 03:46.276
But I don't take a nap.

03:46.296 --> 03:49.280
I turn on the TV and listen to Rush Limbaugh, one of those idiots.

03:50.041 --> 03:54.086
He's not an idiot, but he gets a little bit annoying at times.

03:54.146 --> 03:57.030
And then I come back for an hour or so in the afternoon.

03:58.432 --> 04:00.274
I get papers to review.

04:01.957 --> 04:05.481
These kids are busy writing manuscripts.

04:07.469 --> 04:10.033
I stay in touch with my coworkers at M.D.

04:10.053 --> 04:11.275
Anderson regularly.

04:12.758 --> 04:17.445
So I'm not real busy, but I've got enough to keep life interesting.

04:18.447 --> 04:21.412
And do you have any physical hobbies?

04:22.714 --> 04:23.976
Oh, I go to.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.836
Yeah I go there.

04:27.916 --> 04:31.340
I run two miles and I do some weights.

04:31.961 --> 04:33.683
But nothing more than that.

04:33.943 --> 04:41.792
I used to go to the, oh heck, what do they call it, when the girls in the front of the room you'd follow those procedures.

04:42.092 --> 04:48.260
Well I don't go there anymore because I don't like looking at those 19, 20 and 20 year old fannies anymore.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.043
How would you describe

04:51.715 --> 04:57.942
the changes at Texas A&M in general since you first arrived?

04:57.962 --> 04:59.784
Oh, well, they've been revolutionary.

05:01.006 --> 05:12.599
I mean, this was a provincial little school whose only function was to give people a good bachelor's degree and nothing more.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.462
There was no pretension of scholarship, really.

05:16.522 --> 05:19.966
And now I think that, you know, it's a first-class university.

05:20.166 --> 05:22.689
Maybe not first class, but getting there if it's not there.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.072
Certainly chemistry, I think, is first class.

05:26.474 --> 05:28.556
I think chemical engineering is right up there.

05:29.157 --> 05:31.680
And probably electrical engineering is very good.

05:33.362 --> 05:34.604
Physics is quite good.

05:36.626 --> 05:39.209
And I can't speak for the other departments.

05:39.249 --> 05:40.210
I don't know them that well.

05:42.854 --> 05:44.115
Well, let me put it this way.

05:44.602 --> 05:48.266
When I go somewhere now, I'm proud to say I'm a professor at Texas A&M.

05:48.346 --> 05:50.949
You know, I feel it's a prestigious thing.

05:51.409 --> 06:00.939
As you look back, has chemistry missed any opportunities that it might have used more effectively here?

06:01.060 --> 06:03.342
Well, the only thing I can say, it could have started earlier.

06:03.582 --> 06:05.024
It should have started earlier.

06:05.124 --> 06:05.684
Other than that?

06:06.325 --> 06:07.226
No, I don't think so.

06:07.246 --> 06:10.930
I think with Martell and the aggressive department heads,

06:11.011 --> 06:13.195
Did we lose any star?

06:13.595 --> 06:15.378
Did we have somebody and let them get away?

06:15.779 --> 06:17.141
Yes, that has happened.

06:17.281 --> 06:28.680
And I'm trying to think of a particular case of, oh yeah, I forget, Shui Chen, something, we had a Chinese fellow that went to Scripps Institute in San Diego.

06:28.941 --> 06:31.585
That was really a first class guy.

06:33.303 --> 06:35.026
And it's happened with a few others, too.

06:35.226 --> 06:50.711
Now, am I correct that there is a good blend in the chemistry faculty of people that came here as comparative beginners and worked their way up, and others who were brought here as very senior people?

06:50.731 --> 06:52.274
Yeah, that's diminished lately.

06:53.135 --> 06:54.417
We don't have many.

06:54.683 --> 07:02.273
A lot of the really good people we had like Cotton, like Scott, or like Barton were brought in.

07:02.554 --> 07:04.416
They were top-notch people already.

07:05.417 --> 07:11.165
We sort of don't need them anymore because fortunately the people that have come in, the younger people, are good.

07:11.726 --> 07:14.289
So they're getting recognition of their own.

07:14.349 --> 07:16.212
Okay.

07:17.674 --> 07:24.623
Are there any new special areas of emphasis that chemistry ought to work on more?

07:26.898 --> 07:36.487
Gee, I think we've got a good spectrum of interests, and you know, we include all of the areas which are currently fashionable.

07:36.747 --> 07:40.651
Is the graduate program about the appropriate size?

07:41.011 --> 07:43.033
Yeah, I wouldn't want to see it to get any bigger.

07:43.193 --> 07:45.375
I think it's sufficiently big.

07:45.495 --> 07:48.398
Oh, 250 plus graduate students, that's plenty.

07:48.438 --> 07:50.379
About how many doctoral students per year?

07:50.439 --> 07:54.323
Are getting out?

07:54.910 --> 07:56.774
The figure I give you is unofficial.

07:56.834 --> 07:58.297
I'd say twenty to twenty-five.

07:59.399 --> 08:01.664
But it's usually right at the top nationally.

08:02.165 --> 08:05.593
And it's overwhelmingly international students?

08:05.613 --> 08:06.214
At present.

08:06.294 --> 08:09.701
It didn't used to be quite, but at present it's- Three out of four?

08:09.862 --> 08:15.754
Well I don't think it's that many yet, but maybe five out of eight

08:16.713 --> 08:21.359
And regardless of where they're from, are the students well prepared when they get here?

08:21.599 --> 08:23.441
We're getting quality students now.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.423
And of course, the China sends us their best.

08:26.304 --> 08:27.646
I mean, I've had a number of them.

08:27.686 --> 08:31.711
They are not only bright, very bright, but hardworking.

08:32.632 --> 08:42.724
How do you initiate the working relationship with a student who is a newcomer to the United States?

08:43.825 --> 08:46.028
Well, hopefully we can communicate orally.

08:46.210 --> 08:47.451
it can be a problem.

08:50.275 --> 08:56.242
But these people generally are, you know I've found them to be self-starters.

08:56.722 --> 09:00.006
You don't have to prod them too much or direct them too much.

09:00.827 --> 09:04.371
They're interested in their own personal progress.

09:05.352 --> 09:07.014
And they have good work habits.

09:07.034 --> 09:07.815
Oh yeah.

09:07.835 --> 09:08.416
You bet.

09:09.437 --> 09:16.065
On average I'd say the average Chinese kid works a good deal harder than the average American kid.

09:17.834 --> 09:30.673
And if you had a choice to pick only one, a typical Chinese, a typical India, a typical Korean, a typical American, which would you pick?

09:31.815 --> 09:38.365
Well, I would take the American if he came with good recommendations, because the communication is so much easier.

09:38.425 --> 09:42.611
And the other secondly Chinese, without question.

09:42.972 --> 09:45.816
Because I've just had some such good

09:46.657 --> 09:50.202
Now, are there a number of women in the graduate program now?

09:50.222 --> 09:50.702
Oh, yeah.

09:50.722 --> 09:51.063
Oh, yeah.

09:51.083 --> 09:55.989
The number of women going into chemistry has increased tremendously in recent years.

09:56.009 --> 09:57.190
And they are good students also?

09:57.711 --> 09:57.951
Sure.

09:57.991 --> 09:58.792
You bet.

09:59.754 --> 09:59.954
All right.

09:59.974 --> 10:10.127
If you were the new consultant hired after a national search to advise the chemistry leadership.

10:11.428 --> 10:12.230
Nationally?

10:12.250 --> 10:12.510
Here.

10:12.870 --> 10:13.431
Oh, here.

10:13.711 --> 10:14.993
What advice would you give them?

10:17.690 --> 10:29.782
Well number one I'd say look at what your competitors are doing in the way of money to the teaching assistants for the simple reasons this is what gets you good graduate students.

10:30.042 --> 10:32.104
You've got to be competitive.

10:32.124 --> 10:34.106
You just won't get the students if you're not.

10:35.707 --> 10:46.718
Another thing I would do if it were possible, have, see we've got this English tutor program, something like that, but you've got to pay good money for that.

10:47.542 --> 11:02.659
I would make that available gratis, because we lose a lot of, well, I said input, or I said productivity, I guess is the word I want, of these Chinese kids, especially because of the language.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.002
The language barrier is such a big one.

11:05.022 --> 11:07.645
So I would say you should make that available.

11:07.765 --> 11:13.532
Have classes that are free and require them to go, but they don't go because it's of the money involved.

11:14.795 --> 11:24.207
The other thing, you know, be sure that the administration is willing to provide you with the latest instrumentation.

11:24.908 --> 11:32.297
Because there again, that's the only way you can compete with your peers and with the national scene and the international scene.

11:32.577 --> 11:37.323
They've got to be able to do the types of experiments that are expected these days.

11:37.403 --> 11:38.945
Now, they have been doing that lately.

11:38.985 --> 11:40.167
I'm not saying they're not.

11:40.808 --> 11:41.568
Just keep it up.

11:41.588 --> 11:42.810
Yeah, keep it up.

11:43.364 --> 11:51.243
All right, now you've just been promoted as a consultant and you're advising the campus leadership.

11:52.025 --> 11:54.973
What advice would you give Texas A&M's leadership?

11:55.734 --> 12:01.288
Oh, what I would say is go over to a chairmanship system instead of heads.

12:01.825 --> 12:07.720
You should think enough of your faculty to know that they can handle this type of government.

12:08.924 --> 12:11.009
That's one thing I would tell them to do.

12:12.072 --> 12:17.185
Another thing, you know, look at these teaching loads.

12:17.738 --> 12:24.896
If you expect, that's not, chemistry's very good now, but I understand some departments have very heavy teaching loads.

12:25.438 --> 12:31.593
If you expect scholarship from your professors, you've got to give them enough time to devote to scholarship.

12:31.694 --> 12:32.676
So if they've got

12:33.348 --> 12:42.645
Four courses to teach, there's no way on earth you can seriously expect, you know, intellectual productivity from these people.

12:43.867 --> 12:46.191
And then, of course, you've got to look at your salaries.

12:46.492 --> 12:47.894
Are they competitive?

12:48.656 --> 12:51.020
How do we compare, as far as you know, there?

12:51.521 --> 12:52.282
Salary-wise?

12:52.322 --> 12:54.146
Well, I don't know, because I honestly don't know.

12:54.186 --> 12:56.470
I think in chemistry we are competitive.

12:56.804 --> 13:00.388
I don't know about English and modern languages and histories.

13:00.789 --> 13:01.770
I don't think we are there.

13:01.790 --> 13:04.333
I assume we are in the sciences.

13:04.353 --> 13:13.304
I think in history, I mean in chemistry, we definitely are because we're getting a high caliber of people coming in and you won't get them unless you are competitive.

13:13.925 --> 13:24.398
Is there, again we're now at the institutional level, are there a few universities that you would think we ought to study carefully as our model

13:26.909 --> 13:34.962
Well I think the first class public universities, I don't think you want to look at Stanford and Harvard, which they do, but that's not realistic.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.965
Who do you think are the first class publics?

13:37.546 --> 13:39.469
Well Michigan is way up there.

13:39.530 --> 13:41.052
Texas is way up there.

13:42.675 --> 13:45.880
UC Berkeley is way up there.

13:47.603 --> 13:50.988
But Michigan and Purdue is way up there.

13:51.489 --> 13:54.013
Should we attempt to increase the enrollment?

13:54.297 --> 13:58.403
No, I don't think that this increasing enrollment accomplishes anything.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.665
Hell, this is a big school.

13:59.725 --> 14:00.266
It's big enough.

14:01.227 --> 14:06.354
If the demand is there, you'll probably have the obligation as a public institution to increase it.

14:07.356 --> 14:08.978
What about the admission requirements?

14:09.999 --> 14:13.525
Well, I don't know where they are now, but I think you should make them as high as possible.

14:13.965 --> 14:15.327
There'll be no doubt about that.

14:16.088 --> 14:18.752
Let's say you want to keep it at 43,000.

14:19.340 --> 14:23.225
then you should strive to get a better quality all the time.

14:24.026 --> 14:30.996
There are lots of public institutions where you can go and get a college education.

14:31.056 --> 14:33.179
Well, heck, send them there.

14:34.340 --> 14:37.084
Hey, you've been here a long time.

14:37.204 --> 14:37.785
You bet.

14:37.965 --> 14:39.026
Why did you stay here?

14:39.968 --> 14:40.729
Why did I stay?

14:41.089 --> 14:43.272
Well, once I got my research grants,

14:45.057 --> 14:49.263
And especially I've got to say Arthur Martell, I could see that things would happen here.

14:50.285 --> 14:51.727
I felt good about my future.

14:52.368 --> 14:56.894
When did you begin to think more positively about the community?

14:58.497 --> 15:05.547
Good Lord, I can't give you a date but when they, you know, more restaurants came in and more shopping centers and

15:06.758 --> 15:13.326
Because living here, and heck you can even buy imported Italian prosciutto now in this town, you know, which to me means a great deal.

15:13.386 --> 15:19.013
Have you made any acquaintances with the old Italian families in Bryan?

15:19.053 --> 15:19.293
No.

15:19.393 --> 15:25.200
I know Johnny Lample, but I thought, well I've got some Italian friends, but they are people who came from Italy.

15:26.341 --> 15:27.563
And they bought property here.

15:27.623 --> 15:29.045
They're well-to-do people.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.167
They bought farming land here.

15:32.209 --> 15:33.690
And I know them extremely well.

15:33.810 --> 15:35.112
Spent a lot of time together.

15:36.492 --> 15:40.578
Plus I can practice my language, too.

15:40.718 --> 15:42.921
Well, I mean, you know, Italian sounds good.

15:43.022 --> 15:44.384
Did you grow up speaking Italian?

15:44.404 --> 15:44.684
Yes.

15:44.864 --> 15:45.285
Oh, really?

15:45.305 --> 15:46.567
Yes.

15:46.587 --> 15:48.269
Did you all speak at home?

15:48.550 --> 15:49.531
At home, yeah, of course.

15:49.611 --> 15:50.613
At school it was English.

15:50.633 --> 15:52.996
It was not bilingual, it was English at school.

15:53.016 --> 15:55.440
And did you learn both languages as a child?

15:55.560 --> 15:55.941
Oh, yes.

15:56.161 --> 15:56.622
You have to.

15:56.662 --> 16:02.050
I mean, like I say, school was English, stores were English, so it's not like trying to accommodate.

16:02.130 --> 16:05.014
I get a little annoyed at this bilingual business these days.

16:05.534 --> 16:07.217
If you speak Spanish at home, that's fine.

16:07.959 --> 16:11.566
But heck, school should not accommodate you language-wise.

16:12.788 --> 16:23.188
In El Paso, a fine Mexican-American businessman told me, in a democratic society,

16:23.320 --> 16:29.390
one of the purposes of the government is to teach the language of the marketplace.

16:29.890 --> 16:37.622
He said, the language of the marketplace in this country is English, and if you can't speak English fluently, you're economically disadvantaged.

16:38.223 --> 16:44.333
Then he said, if I want my children also to know Spanish, that is my responsibility.

16:44.617 --> 16:48.863
And I'm grateful if the schools help, but English should be first, and I agree with him.

16:48.883 --> 16:49.524
Absolutely.

16:49.685 --> 16:50.726
He's perfectly right.

16:51.307 --> 17:00.581
When some stranger, some old, old friend that you haven't seen for 40 years, if they were to contact you and say, well, tell me about Texas A&M.

17:00.641 --> 17:01.683
Describe Texas A&M.

17:02.404 --> 17:03.666
How do you describe Texas A&M?

17:03.726 --> 17:08.473
Well, first of all, I'll tell them it's the third or fourth largest university in the land.

17:09.134 --> 17:09.274
Mm-hmm.

17:09.541 --> 17:19.652
I tell them, well of course I'm in chemistry, I tell them we've got a first class chemistry department and we've got what's rated as the best engineering school in the nation in chemical engineering.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.716
I think our engineering school was rated very high by U.S.

17:23.736 --> 17:24.798
News and World Report.

17:26.179 --> 17:30.664
And you know, I tell them our facilities are our first class.

17:31.505 --> 17:38.873
I'll tell them our students don't walk, or most of them with few exceptions don't go around with earrings in their nose.

17:39.983 --> 17:43.086
courteous, polite students, which is true.

17:44.067 --> 17:48.872
I mean I never had real problems except for that one core boy.

17:48.932 --> 17:50.974
I never had a problem all these years, never.

17:53.096 --> 17:58.122
You know I think they're good students, I enjoy them and I think they're competent.

17:58.142 --> 17:59.963
So that's the kind of things I would tell them.

18:01.405 --> 18:03.087
Are you optimistic about A&M's?

18:03.107 --> 18:04.128
Oh absolutely.

18:04.148 --> 18:04.728
Yeah.

18:04.748 --> 18:06.430
I think it's got a great future.

18:07.152 --> 18:18.265
Some years back, a good many years back, we had these foreign student clubs, the Arab students, the Mexican students, the Chinese students, etc.

18:19.746 --> 18:26.314
And they would, I don't know if they exist anymore because at that time, and I'm going back a good many years, they would invite me.

18:26.995 --> 18:27.815
They would have dinners.

18:30.519 --> 18:33.582
And generally the food was very, very good.

18:34.507 --> 18:39.517
One group had the very best food and that was the Arab students.

18:40.639 --> 18:48.135
I was just so surprised, I didn't know anything about Arab food, but it was absolutely great, really good.

18:49.257 --> 18:52.363
That's one of the things I remember very fondly by the way.

18:52.715 --> 18:56.000
No, I think everything else on this list we've covered.

18:56.561 --> 18:59.726
Has anybody ever teased you about a New York accent?

18:59.746 --> 19:00.007
No.

19:00.327 --> 19:00.888
At AMN?

19:00.948 --> 19:01.289
No way?

19:01.349 --> 19:02.711
No, when I first got here.

19:02.871 --> 19:03.232
Okay.

19:03.252 --> 19:04.975
But I think it's largely dissipated.

19:05.055 --> 19:05.656
What do you think?

19:06.537 --> 19:08.140
I'm sure parts of it are still there.

19:08.460 --> 19:12.407
I can tell a little that you're a New Yorker, and I love regional accents.

19:12.427 --> 19:14.310
I don't want us to all sound exactly alike.

19:15.652 --> 19:16.814
No, absolutely.

19:17.936 --> 19:18.857
But I think.

19:19.242 --> 19:23.027
I don't have nearly the accent I used to have.

19:23.127 --> 19:24.409
It's pretty much gone.

19:25.370 --> 19:27.713
But I'm sure the residues are still there.

19:30.396 --> 19:32.899
Okay, get near the end now.

19:32.919 --> 19:45.295
To what people related to Texas A&M are you now most grateful after 40... You mean on a personal basis or just people who have come?

19:45.695 --> 19:46.096
Either way.

19:46.577 --> 19:46.937
Either way.

19:49.094 --> 19:50.757
Well I'm trying to think of real A&M.

19:50.877 --> 19:56.728
Well you know some of the people I've gotten in so well that I admire greatly are the physicians in this town.

19:57.990 --> 20:03.620
Most of them, a number of them with whom I have been involved are A&M graduates.

20:04.862 --> 20:11.254
And first of all I think they're fine physicians, and secondly we've developed a really

20:11.774 --> 20:28.574
pleasant personal relationship, specifically the old James Bonds who got his degree here, and the urologist, Harris, Sam Harrison, Sam Harrison, who got his bachelor's degree here.

20:30.477 --> 20:39.047
But aside from that, I have great remembrance and fond respect for Loretta, he's gone.

20:39.719 --> 20:47.312
I still, you know, Charlie Holland and I still see each other and have lunch, not often, but regularly.

20:48.073 --> 20:55.686
And I, you know, I admire the guy and I enjoy his company.

20:56.088 --> 21:00.074
I never got close to him, but I respect the man.

21:00.214 --> 21:04.239
I think, you know, if somebody accomplished what he did, it merits respect.

21:04.380 --> 21:05.121
He's deceased?

21:05.461 --> 21:07.104
No, no, but he's not well at all.

21:07.124 --> 21:09.447
He's getting dialysis regularly.

21:09.827 --> 21:12.551
So I probably couldn't interview him very easily.

21:13.973 --> 21:14.594
You could try.

21:14.634 --> 21:15.856
Does he live here?

21:16.537 --> 21:18.620
He lives a few miles out of town.

21:18.680 --> 21:22.365
He's got a house out in the country, but he comes in.

21:22.784 --> 21:27.533
If and when you see him... I can mention this type of thing to him.

21:27.834 --> 21:33.204
Yeah, and describe it as you, for better or for worse, describe... You'd probably have to go see him.

21:33.285 --> 21:33.565
Oh, of course.

21:33.585 --> 21:34.407
He's not that well.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.930
Oh, I'd go wherever he wanted.

21:36.110 --> 21:36.451
Okay.

21:37.172 --> 21:37.793
If he would like.

21:38.655 --> 21:41.641
And his speech is somewhat impaired because he had a stroke.

21:42.302 --> 21:45.248
Who else in the department do you feel most grateful to?

21:46.105 --> 21:50.350
Well you see, most of the people with whom I was involved are gone.

21:50.530 --> 21:51.071
That's all right.

21:51.491 --> 21:53.434
Now you want, have you talked with Peter Rodriguez?

21:54.215 --> 21:54.415
No.

21:54.535 --> 21:56.317
Oh you get in touch with him.

21:56.337 --> 21:56.738
Oh I want to.

21:56.758 --> 22:00.662
He knows this department from A to Z. Yes, oh I want to.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.966
You do that if you want to know something about the chemistry department here.

22:03.986 --> 22:11.235
I'm thinking about to see some of the people that are still here that know something about the past and there are not many of them.

22:11.435 --> 22:16.727
Were there some key people in the chemistry department office, some secretaries?

22:17.309 --> 22:21.278
Well, the only one that's been there a really long time is Judy Ludwig.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.503
Judy Ludwig's been there good many years.

22:24.305 --> 22:25.748
Now, on campus,

22:26.892 --> 22:29.154
Except you can't get her, she never answered her phone.

22:29.174 --> 22:34.099
Jody Trankman, she works over in marketing now.

22:34.940 --> 22:39.645
But she was here at Good Peace back in, oh good heavens.

22:39.665 --> 22:41.947
I'd say 70 to 76 thereabouts.

22:41.987 --> 22:46.371
But she worked with Beckham and oh I know another guy I can talk to.

22:46.972 --> 22:49.915
And he's retired, he's an old man, Fred Cecilio.

22:49.935 --> 22:51.376
Oh I hadn't thought about him.

22:51.556 --> 22:52.637
Fred Cecilio.

22:52.657 --> 22:54.199
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:55.377 --> 22:56.919
He'd be glad to talk to you.

22:56.939 --> 22:57.039
Okay.

22:57.639 --> 22:57.960
All right.

22:58.941 --> 23:00.242
Last two questions then.

23:00.502 --> 23:00.862
Okay.

23:01.623 --> 23:10.552
Let's make believe that someone hands you a check for a million dollars or more with one restriction.

23:10.572 --> 23:15.777
You must pass that money to Texas A&M, but you decide... How I want to spend it?

23:16.098 --> 23:16.518
Oh, yeah.

23:16.538 --> 23:18.580
I think I put it into student scholarships.

23:19.641 --> 23:21.503
For what kind of students?

23:21.652 --> 23:26.858
No, I think they should, I hate to say they should be for this time, just any, the best qualified students.

23:26.878 --> 23:27.779
Undergraduates?

23:27.799 --> 23:29.160
Oh, yeah, yeah, undergraduates.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.502
How do you select the winners?

23:31.262 --> 23:33.465
Well, don't we have a committee here on campus?

23:34.125 --> 23:35.327
But how would you want it done?

23:36.048 --> 23:45.718
Oh, I'd simply, I mean, if I were making the decision, number one, I'd want to know nothing about

23:45.884 --> 23:47.646
their family background or anything.

23:47.667 --> 23:50.991
I have one application with a number on it.

23:51.232 --> 23:54.997
I don't want to know if it's a man or a woman, black, white, or... Strictly on ability?

23:55.257 --> 23:56.799
Yes, yes, that's right.

23:56.819 --> 23:58.161
Does it matter what they're majoring in?

23:58.241 --> 23:59.483
No, absolutely not.

24:00.865 --> 24:02.127
I agree with you entirely.

24:02.768 --> 24:04.931
That's what I've always thought is the fair way.

24:04.951 --> 24:06.633
No, they could major in anything they like.

24:08.436 --> 24:09.818
Okay, then the last question.

24:10.338 --> 24:13.663
What feelings about Texas A&M do you carry in your heart?

24:15.787 --> 24:19.413
Well, I've grown to love the place.

24:20.956 --> 24:23.060
It's home, you know, it's home.

24:23.100 --> 24:26.586
Like people say, you're retired, you're going to go to California or Florida.

24:26.606 --> 24:27.648
No, I said, this is home.

24:29.832 --> 24:30.573
I love the place.

24:31.194 --> 24:32.977
I mean, I really have an affection for it.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.525
Can it be otherwise after this many years?
