WEBVTT

00:05.330 --> 00:13.682
I still harbored in the back of my mind that I could go back to the family farm when I got out of service, but the avenue wasn't really there.

00:13.902 --> 00:34.290
My brother thought he wanted to go back, and Dr. Coonsie had, I suppose you could say, indoctrinated me or about half convinced me that maybe graduate study was the thing that I should do, and so I

00:35.485 --> 00:44.673
I thought I'd leave the farm to my brother and I would go the graduate student route because I didn't think that route was open to him.

00:45.974 --> 00:53.801
And I guess I must have developed some liking for the research arena.

00:56.184 --> 01:03.450
Describe this man Kunze and his strengths and his area of specialization.

01:03.937 --> 01:06.359
Dr. Kunze was a soil mineralogist.

01:06.379 --> 01:15.627
By training, he grew up on a farm in Central Texas, near LaGrange at Warda, where he is today, incidentally, farming.

01:16.108 --> 01:16.908
German parents.

01:18.290 --> 01:22.713
I don't think I ever met his parents, but I understand his mother spoke very broken English.

01:22.733 --> 01:24.595
Much preferred to speak in German than English.

01:25.696 --> 01:32.442
Attended a church there where they had Lutheran services in German periodically.

01:33.637 --> 02:01.956
Kunze was a man, I would say, of the highest integrity, very set in his ways, known for being pretty Scotch, a real stickler in research for precision and work, for checking and double checking everything you did, making sure if you said something in writing that you could back it up.

02:03.269 --> 02:33.208
always always eager to try to explain the unexplainable in work a hard worker himself and expected hard work from those around him but a but a very kind man a very generous one in in relationships and worked well with students worked very well with students i'd say with most students i i

02:33.880 --> 02:39.567
If you were, quote, if you were a conformist student, he worked well with you.

02:40.708 --> 02:44.372
If you function more as a non-conformist, I think you'd have trouble.

02:45.974 --> 02:59.770
Who were the other individuals during your undergraduate years that, looking back, you can tell had a strong influence on your life?

03:03.766 --> 03:06.829
Well, T.E.

03:06.849 --> 03:11.114
McAfee was an influential person.

03:11.234 --> 03:13.717
I had him in one or two or three courses.

03:19.223 --> 03:22.327
Dr. Mogford taught a cotton production course.

03:24.770 --> 03:26.471
I had a lot of respect for him.

03:27.392 --> 03:29.655
I had a fellow named

03:29.905 --> 03:49.909
Henry Hadley that I took plant genetics from that I thought was an outstanding teacher and, but probably I interacted so much more with those, with those faculty members in agronomy.

03:49.969 --> 03:52.993
They probably, Hank Foth,

03:55.994 --> 03:56.876
T.E.

03:56.957 --> 04:11.657
McAfee, Hampton in a way, I always say you learn about as much from a lot of folks about what not, how not to do some things as how to do.

04:12.127 --> 04:15.912
But I felt a lot of respect for most of those faculty.

04:16.413 --> 04:17.554
Dick Potts was around.

04:17.594 --> 04:19.697
I don't think I ever had a course from Dick.

04:19.837 --> 04:28.949
I knew him so well later, but I don't remember him as impacting me at the undergraduate level.

04:29.029 --> 04:37.780
I'd have to say probably the major people in there were Folth and McAfee and Hampton and Coonsie.

04:38.553 --> 04:47.666
Of course I, although I didn't have classes from them, at that time I got to know Morris Bloodworth and J.B.

04:47.706 --> 04:54.035
Page because they were both faculty in that area.

04:58.020 --> 05:00.844
I never really had a lot of personal interaction with Page.

05:00.924 --> 05:02.066
I just, I knew him.

05:03.688 --> 05:07.834
You always saw him at, Coonsie had an air-conditioned lab.

05:08.928 --> 05:13.394
in the old red brick building where we worked is because of the x-ray.

05:13.474 --> 05:20.945
He had x-ray diffraction equipment, and when he got that equipment, he managed to get the lab air conditioned.

05:21.205 --> 05:30.058
So that was where everybody came in the afternoon for their afternoon coffee or Cokes, and they always flipped to see who'd buy the Cokes.

05:31.152 --> 05:37.380
And they all loved to stick Coonsie with the drinks because he cried so loud.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.244
I mean, he just moaned and groaned to high heaven.

05:40.284 --> 05:50.196
And Page, I don't know whether he was lucky or crooked or what, but he almost never seemed to get stuck with buying the drinks.

05:50.216 --> 05:55.523
And poor Coonsie seemed to get stuck almost every other day.

05:56.414 --> 06:09.603
Incidentally, during those days in that old red brick building there was a particular statue secretary in entomology and the mailboxes were over in the agronomy building.

06:10.445 --> 06:13.612
And they'd walk from entomology over to the agronomy building and check the mail.

06:13.752 --> 06:16.498
She made the trip about the same time every day.

06:16.968 --> 06:29.221
And we joked sometime and said if the old red brick building had been a ship, it would lift and tilt to that side at that time every day because nobody wanted to miss that trip she made to that.

06:29.241 --> 06:30.382
To see that attractive.

06:30.442 --> 06:31.103
To see the mail.

06:31.323 --> 06:33.165
To get the mail.

06:34.086 --> 06:41.533
As you look back now in those undergraduate years, what was A&M doing well?

06:44.937 --> 06:45.017
Hmm.

06:46.803 --> 06:55.333
Just beginning, just beginning to establish, I guess, a reputation for research in agricultural areas.

06:58.637 --> 07:09.710
Recruiting, beginning to recruit some really good people and to set a very different tone, but probably to say what they were doing well.

07:10.931 --> 07:16.017
I think it was mainly just teaching people how to

07:17.178 --> 07:22.605
perhaps respect other people and take the attitude that things are doable, you can do.

07:23.306 --> 07:34.922
I thought it had a can-do attitude then, one level of friendliness, a lack of snootiness, and an attitude that we get things done.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.085
You finish from here, you can do things.

07:38.367 --> 07:46.678
The typical Aggie student, describe the typical A&M student, other than being male, we know they were,

07:47.333 --> 07:48.235
Where were they from?

07:48.315 --> 07:49.717
What were their attitudes?

07:50.458 --> 07:52.321
How diverse was the student body?

07:55.507 --> 08:09.129
Well, as I indicated earlier, I think it was certainly diverse in relation to my own personal background, but it probably wasn't as diverse as it could have been in terms of reflecting the population.

08:09.430 --> 08:13.797
Obviously, it was an all-white, all-male

08:14.890 --> 08:28.023
And I suppose a lot of, at that time, a relatively high percentage of students came from rural backgrounds, small schools, modest incomes.

08:29.484 --> 08:39.174
However, there were, in those days, there were a lot of students from Houston and Beaumont and city people.

08:42.317 --> 08:44.779
But I think that the,

08:47.459 --> 09:00.691
The attitude was probably still pretty much that of an agrarian kind of attitude, particularly in the College of Agriculture in Los Angeles.

09:00.751 --> 09:05.595
Now, college business may be different.

09:07.877 --> 09:12.641
Three of my good friends were accounting majors that were seniors.

09:12.661 --> 09:14.183
One of them came from San Antonio.

09:15.284 --> 09:16.605
One came from

09:17.075 --> 09:21.779
New Boston, Texas, small town, but the other came from Houston.

09:22.660 --> 09:26.363
And as a matter of fact, I think it was the fourth county who was also from Houston.

09:27.084 --> 09:41.457
So, you know, we were city kids and others, I guess overwhelmingly Protestant, although quite a few Roman Catholics within our group.

09:43.299 --> 09:44.500
Were there some Jewish students?

09:46.252 --> 09:47.333
Very few.

09:47.453 --> 09:53.439
If we had, I don't believe, I don't believe I ever had a Jewish student in my outfit.

09:55.001 --> 09:55.962
Did, were there students?

09:55.982 --> 09:58.804
Hispanics, there were a lot of Hispanics, but no blacks, of course.

09:58.824 --> 10:01.047
Were there student nicknames in that era?

10:01.647 --> 10:01.927
Yeah.

10:02.468 --> 10:03.049
What was yours?

10:03.429 --> 10:03.849
Pogo.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.152
Pogo.

10:06.212 --> 10:06.752
Because?

10:07.373 --> 10:08.174
The comic strip.

10:09.515 --> 10:09.855
Okay.

10:09.915 --> 10:10.996
Somebody hung it on me.

10:11.096 --> 10:12.998
It did not have, it wasn't a pogo stick.

10:13.359 --> 10:14.740
No, it was just pogo.

10:15.277 --> 10:20.684
Were there some other good nicknames in your outfit or among your acquaintances you recall?

10:22.927 --> 10:23.507
Golly.

10:27.573 --> 10:32.499
Well, my roommate was called Mother most of the time.

10:32.519 --> 10:33.220
Kent Mahone.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.501
We called him Mother Mahone.

10:38.286 --> 10:38.807
Let's see.

10:40.509 --> 10:40.609
Trim.

10:43.711 --> 10:48.118
Oh, we had a, there was a guy named Alton Breedlove that we called Breedy a lot of the times.

10:51.863 --> 10:58.933
What was he called?

10:58.953 --> 11:01.597
I brought a nickname of Bubba with him.

11:01.617 --> 11:02.479
We called him Bubba.

11:08.267 --> 11:12.874
We had one, when we were seniors, we had one that transferred to us from one of the,

11:13.158 --> 11:19.709
Calvary outfit, so naturally he was called Jock.

11:19.729 --> 11:21.933
The Hispanics, do you remember any nicknames for them?

11:26.140 --> 11:26.941
I don't.

11:26.961 --> 11:34.253
Except Melvin Maltz has told me that all the Jewish students that he knew of, including him, that their nickname was Jew Boy.

11:35.255 --> 11:39.402
And he said, we didn't take it as a put down, and we don't think

11:39.905 --> 11:41.468
It was intended as a put down.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.813
Today, that would be very politically unacceptable.

11:45.594 --> 11:49.761
I never, I never heard any, I don't believe I ever heard a student referred to as you boy.

11:51.264 --> 11:55.531
But I, I might not have, as I say, might not have had any.

11:55.932 --> 12:01.922
Were there, were there any international students that you were aware of?

12:02.042 --> 12:02.903
Graduate students?

12:03.604 --> 12:04.125
I didn't know.

12:04.606 --> 12:05.187
Let's see.

12:07.073 --> 12:10.820
I don't believe I knew of any international students with us in the Corps.

12:13.846 --> 12:16.110
And there weren't many out-of-state students, were there?

12:16.751 --> 12:17.813
Comparatively few.

12:18.695 --> 12:19.897
Comparatively few.

12:20.478 --> 12:23.544
When I came down as a freshman, I mentioned that fellow from Colorado.

12:24.285 --> 12:29.976
It seemed like we had one or two maybe from Louisiana.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.001
But no, there were very few.

12:32.722 --> 12:35.805
It was a very regional university.

12:36.386 --> 12:39.149
All right, back to the way A&M did things.

12:39.649 --> 12:46.496
In hindsight, were there any mistakes that you think A&M was making in those undergraduate days for you?

12:50.120 --> 12:56.807
Well, it should have been, the course should have been optional, I think.

12:59.842 --> 13:09.372
I think with the end of World War II, probably the sooner we could get integrated racially and sexually, the better it would be.

13:09.773 --> 13:11.995
Did anybody ever talk about any of that?

13:12.015 --> 13:12.696
Did you remember?

13:14.117 --> 13:16.320
Probably if we had, it would have been in a very negative way.

13:16.340 --> 13:21.205
It would be the death knell of the university or something.

13:24.228 --> 13:28.633
No, I don't remember much conversation about it at all, to tell you the truth.

13:29.457 --> 13:33.683
When you bought that ring that you're wearing, what were your feelings?

13:39.993 --> 13:42.757
I'd earned it.

13:42.777 --> 13:44.059
I guess.

13:44.079 --> 13:45.642
That's what I thought.

13:45.662 --> 13:46.223
Finally.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.506
At last.

13:48.526 --> 13:49.548
Do you remember what it cost?

13:53.774 --> 13:55.617
I want to say $45.

13:57.942 --> 14:04.610
That was about one-twentieth of what it cost me to be here a year or more.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.035
Yeah, about one-twentieth of what it cost me.

14:09.055 --> 14:10.356
So a year cost about how much?

14:10.456 --> 14:11.798
Eight, eight, nine hundred dollars.

14:12.178 --> 14:13.440
And where did you get that money?

14:15.682 --> 14:18.666
Well, I worked from the time I was down here.

14:18.706 --> 14:22.330
I worked in Coonsie's lab and started at

14:28.351 --> 14:30.674
I think I started at 65 cents an hour.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.461
Might not have been that much.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.609
I remember before I graduated I got to 75.

14:43.253 --> 14:46.798
So I worked 10 to 20 hours a week.

14:47.015 --> 15:08.719
my dad of course i worked in summertime every summer between freshman sophomore sophomore and junior between junior and senior years i had to take six weeks out for summer camp but other than that i worked on the farm did he so dad would give me uh basically what i needed i guess you'd say did he

15:09.256 --> 15:11.759
pay you a wage for that summer?

15:12.159 --> 15:13.681
No, no.

15:13.701 --> 15:15.022
That was true in my family, too.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.526
No, no, I never got paid by my dad.

15:19.367 --> 15:20.068
Mine was.

15:20.168 --> 15:24.512
Well, I got paid many times over, but not on an hourly basis.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.274
He was saying, when you sit down at the table.

15:27.095 --> 15:29.157
Yeah, you're getting yours.

15:29.718 --> 15:34.403
But we were, my dad was a good farmer.

15:35.665 --> 15:47.926
And even through those drought years, of course it wasn't as dry in northeast Texas as it was in a lot of places, but through those drought years he managed to come out.

15:50.070 --> 15:53.476
But I'll have to say I think I truly was frugal down here.

15:53.576 --> 15:57.403
I did not waste any money.

15:59.543 --> 16:08.096
I believe that four years, certainly for the four years, the cost averaged less than $800 a year if you take the four years.

16:08.217 --> 16:19.314
I'm sure the senior year was more because taking those weekend trips to San Antonio and things were, that showed I was coming up in the standard living world.

16:20.576 --> 16:23.320
Let's see, we have mentioned bonfire.

16:23.761 --> 16:26.445
Describe the Aggie bonfire in your student years.

16:28.197 --> 16:31.921
Now, I've had a lot of time to think about that in recent weeks and months.

16:33.363 --> 16:37.267
It was on the drill field in those years.

16:39.290 --> 16:43.594
We had to work on it as freshmen and sophomores.

16:43.975 --> 16:46.478
I don't remember being particularly active as a senior.

16:46.918 --> 16:49.421
I was probably out there little.

16:50.282 --> 16:56.449
I was in the cut area, but I don't remember going to cut areas very much.

16:57.307 --> 17:00.091
I don't remember these all-night pushes to build it.

17:00.671 --> 17:14.669
I know we had guard rings around it because there are always the stories, you know, about the Texas guy that tried to drop a barrel of gasoline or something on it and set it off and that kind of thing.

17:14.729 --> 17:18.774
So you kind of expected, quote, the T-CIPs to make a raid on at any time.

17:20.417 --> 17:22.719
So we had to pull guard duty around it.

17:23.080 --> 17:26.284
I don't ever remember being on a stack in construction.

17:27.023 --> 17:30.750
I do remember hauling logs all over the place.

17:31.271 --> 17:34.838
And it was only logs in your day?

17:35.039 --> 17:37.483
Because before World War II, it was trash.

17:37.503 --> 17:38.325
No, it was logs.

17:38.465 --> 17:41.691
About how many stacks high was it?

17:42.693 --> 17:43.114
Do you remember?

17:44.357 --> 17:48.745
I don't know, but I can tell you for sure it was a lot fatter at the bottom than they are today.

17:48.877 --> 17:52.922
and we didn't have any of that power equipment to hoist the logs out there.

17:53.002 --> 18:15.829
You hoisted them with a rope, and you pushed them up with sticks around the side, and you hoisted them with a rope to get them to the higher levels, and the ropes that stabilized that thing, you'd have three or four out, but when you were working on it, you had to have anywhere from 20 to 40 people on a rope, and you had people directing

18:16.450 --> 18:20.096
how to pull this way or that way to keep the pole straight.

18:20.877 --> 18:28.911
So it took a lot of manpower just to keep the stack stabilized where you could push things up to it.

18:29.272 --> 18:31.896
And you said rope, not cable.

18:31.916 --> 18:32.697
I think it was rope.

18:33.058 --> 18:36.344
What I remember being is rope.

18:36.424 --> 18:38.507
Because we just had our hands on it.

18:38.527 --> 18:39.589
And y'all...

18:40.936 --> 18:44.545
As human beings, you lifted the logs and put them on the truck.

18:44.665 --> 18:45.567
That's absolutely right.

18:45.587 --> 18:48.755
And you got them off the truck and so forth.

18:50.338 --> 18:54.047
Was the terminology already there, red pots and that sort of thing?

18:54.208 --> 18:55.050
Don't remember that.

18:56.072 --> 18:57.696
May have been, but I don't remember that.

18:58.638 --> 19:21.046
Somehow we could identify, usually we had outfit markers of some kind on our uniforms or suits, and I suppose it would always be so you could recognize junior, senior, sophomores, and freshmen by some mechanism, if not the uniform, but they probably wore fatigues and had their insignia or something on them.

19:21.186 --> 19:26.012
Do you remember any injuries connected with Bonfire?

19:27.342 --> 19:33.948
No, nothing, oh, I mean, people getting hand-skinned and, you know.

19:34.589 --> 19:36.291
But no broken legs, no?

19:36.331 --> 19:39.193
No, no, I don't, I don't remember that.

19:39.794 --> 19:41.816
And what kind of chainsaws did y'all use?

19:43.097 --> 19:43.818
Never heard of one.

19:43.858 --> 19:46.661
You cut them down with axes.

19:47.762 --> 19:47.982
Yeah, yeah.

19:48.002 --> 19:53.367
And I presume there must have been some city boys that didn't know anything about using an axe.

19:54.359 --> 20:05.149
I think, well now I suppose, I can't remember specific instances, but I know, I know that during those years there must have been stories of people hitting themselves in the foot with an axe and that kind of thing.

20:05.169 --> 20:08.872
I think that happened pretty, fairly often.

20:08.952 --> 20:12.856
Although they tried to coach people on using tools like that.

20:12.876 --> 20:21.684
And as I said, I don't, I was not often out in the cutting area and I never did any, I can't remember personally doing any cutting.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.366
I can remember hoisting the logs out of there.

20:25.291 --> 20:32.924
But I probably wasn't all that gung-ho to be the, quote, to try to be.

20:32.944 --> 20:35.508
I wasn't a leader in those days, anyway, period.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.309
I wasn't a leader.

20:36.510 --> 20:45.244
I'd have been more of a follower, and I'd have been one to take a toll to grab that stick over there with somebody else and help them lift the log on the truck, that kind of thing.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.750
Let's see, a goofy one that just popped in my brain.

20:48.933 --> 20:55.221
Earl Rudder one day asked me, when did the students quit shooting at Prexy's Moon?

20:56.102 --> 20:57.023
Did you ever hear that?

20:57.624 --> 20:59.226
Do you know what Prexy's Moon was?

21:00.267 --> 21:12.964
There used to be, up on top of the academic building dome, a light fixture holder that went up and then curved and had a big light bulb hanging down right over it.

21:13.464 --> 21:17.269
And he said when he was a student, it was really something.

21:17.755 --> 21:23.583
to shoot it, and he said, therefore, there were some holes in the dome in his day.

21:24.565 --> 21:28.571
Of course, nobody ever knew who ever shot at it.

21:28.831 --> 21:29.872
I don't think it was up there.

21:31.735 --> 21:42.090
And apparently in his day, the president was called Prexy, because I remember he two or three times referred to himself as Prexy, and we faculty members thought that was goofy.

21:42.431 --> 21:43.733
We'd never heard such a word.

21:44.413 --> 21:46.176
I don't remember hearing that word either.

21:46.679 --> 21:48.885
And I was never in them.

21:48.905 --> 21:50.048
Believe me, I was never in them.

21:50.088 --> 21:53.777
But getting down in the steam tunnels was a thing.

21:53.797 --> 21:55.441
Oh, you never did go in them?

21:55.482 --> 21:56.364
I've never been in them.

21:56.645 --> 21:58.730
But I've heard tales about going into steam tunnels.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.334
What was supposedly down there?

22:01.597 --> 22:09.026
Well, it was a way to get around the campus without being seen, I thought, was the main advantage of the steam tunnel.

22:09.046 --> 22:15.073
So the steam tunnel apparently was most likely related to some kind of mischief.

22:15.093 --> 22:15.633
Oh, yeah.

22:15.713 --> 22:16.174
Good book.

22:16.194 --> 22:18.056
Yeah, yeah, it was mischief for sure.

22:19.077 --> 22:19.938
Mischief for sure.

22:21.480 --> 22:30.270
And it's in the book on Bryant, but I clearly remember that happening once while I was here, the guys bringing

22:30.773 --> 22:38.142
into one of the dorms, I think it was in a jock dorm, but brought the prostitute in in a big bag over their shoulder.

22:38.162 --> 22:38.662
Oh really?

22:38.682 --> 22:41.686
Yeah, oh yeah.

22:41.706 --> 22:46.471
Now what did you and your buddies think about the athletes when you were an undergraduate?

22:47.072 --> 22:55.802
Were they real students or were they getting an easy deal academically?

22:59.562 --> 23:06.816
Some of them, you know, some of them were in the Corps outfits with the rest of us, although didn't many of them live with us.

23:06.836 --> 23:11.484
I guess they still lived in Hart Hall until Henderson was built.

23:12.887 --> 23:21.503
And that was in the Barrett Bryant era.

23:22.276 --> 23:35.218
Of course Hart Hall was so centrally located and everybody walked by it and saw it and clearly they had less requirements put on them as far as being militarily correct and that kind of thing.

23:35.398 --> 23:37.281
And you could get a

23:37.953 --> 23:41.557
condom full of water on your head if you walk too close to Art Hall.

23:41.597 --> 23:43.499
That was the dangerous thing to do.

23:44.200 --> 23:44.840
We knew that.

23:45.942 --> 23:53.270
They were just, yeah, they were viewed as having it, I don't know about as far as academics are concerned, but they were certainly viewed as having it easy.

23:54.311 --> 23:56.994
No discipline as far as military.

23:57.014 --> 24:01.999
Were there supposedly some courses that only athletes took where they got easy grades?

24:03.401 --> 24:04.081
I don't know that.

24:04.242 --> 24:05.563
I've never heard of any.

24:05.965 --> 24:15.240
I know Bob Smith took, I've heard all those stories about how many times Bob Smith took the beginning biology kind of stuff.

24:15.520 --> 24:24.775
Were there some courses that were legendary, while you were a student, that were legendary for being a little easier for anybody to get a grade?

24:29.022 --> 24:31.045
Or were there some grade point courses?

24:31.312 --> 24:32.374
I'm sure there were.

24:32.414 --> 24:34.257
It's hard for me to identify one.

24:36.741 --> 24:53.809
Plant Physiology, which a lot of us had to take and which Wayne Hall taught at the time was a, subject matter wise, pretty tough course, but it was pretty well known that Wayne had four multiple choice tests and if you got all four of them,

24:55.375 --> 25:01.565
the normal expectation is you were going to get one of the four, so you just memorized those four tests.

25:01.746 --> 25:14.647
He, the semester I took it, he, of course I had the four tests, everybody else did too, but the semester I took it, he took one of those four tests and doctored it in very subtle kinds of ways.

25:15.088 --> 25:19.375
And it, literally, it had gotten so bad that people would just go in and read the first

25:21.076 --> 25:27.570
question or two and say, oh, this is, you know, this is that test and they just mark right down through the exam and hand it in.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.977
He'd usually change

25:29.783 --> 25:32.207
Well, I don't remember, 40, 50-question test.

25:32.227 --> 25:37.394
There might be two or three changed on the whole exam, but they'd just mark it and walk out.

25:38.256 --> 25:48.711
Well, a lot of them did that this time and, of course, he caught a bunch of people flat-footed and didn't realize it.

25:48.731 --> 25:52.517
A lot of them absolutely didn't realize it until they started handing the papers back.

25:52.497 --> 25:56.000
I can almost still see Wayne Hall handing the papers back.

25:56.060 --> 25:57.422
He never said a word about it.

25:57.482 --> 26:04.929
Not one word did he ever mention, but you could see the kind of the slyest grin on his face when he was handing these papers back.

26:04.949 --> 26:06.890
Yeah, I got you guys.

26:06.910 --> 26:15.138
And, of course, they started calling me a blankety-blanko for changing up his exam.

26:15.318 --> 26:16.740
So that was an easy class.

26:16.980 --> 26:19.022
I mean, the subject matter was not easy at all.

26:19.362 --> 26:21.424
It was easy.

26:21.775 --> 26:27.200
Now, were you and your buddies aware of his eminence as a scholar when y'all were taking his courses?

26:28.602 --> 26:29.122
Not really.

26:30.163 --> 26:30.824
No, not.

26:34.027 --> 26:42.776
I knew he was a very polished man and spoke with that clearly clipped voice that he had.

26:42.796 --> 26:49.723
So I think you'd easily recognize him as knowing his stuff, but I don't think

26:51.053 --> 26:56.521
Were there some legendary tough courses that most folks had to take?

26:59.146 --> 27:03.152
Organic chemistry, I suppose, was known to be tough.

27:05.515 --> 27:12.967
Well, even in those days, we had cowboy organic, which is step and a half hedges taught.

27:12.987 --> 27:18.175
And the, when I, now this was when I was a graduate student and I took the

27:18.965 --> 27:23.173
the tough organic at that time called 301 and 302.

27:24.555 --> 27:28.222
And oh my goodness, I had his name.

27:32.851 --> 27:35.155
He was a little Jewish prophet, Sarkov?

27:35.976 --> 27:38.020
Rakov, Rakov, that's it.

27:38.287 --> 27:39.169
Rakoff.

27:39.189 --> 27:39.911
Good teacher.

27:40.472 --> 27:41.955
Absolutely outstanding teacher.

27:43.178 --> 27:44.701
Had a lot of little sayings about him.

27:45.022 --> 27:50.153
He'd come in and say he had a dog, knew more organic chemistry than we did, kind of thing.

27:50.755 --> 27:55.485
But he was an excellent prof, but a tough, demanding prof.

27:56.242 --> 28:02.114
Now, I've heard others talk about Square Root Jackson, Cube Root Kent, the engineering math courses.

28:02.134 --> 28:04.438
Didn't have any of those.

28:04.699 --> 28:05.701
I've tried to remember.

28:05.841 --> 28:08.727
I think I had a man named Hall in calculus.

28:10.069 --> 28:18.165
And I had a, golly, I should remember the man I had trig or plane analytics from, Hoverack.

28:19.917 --> 28:23.883
He was a good teacher.

28:24.664 --> 28:29.652
What about Dr. Dan, the grade point man, Dan Russell, rural sociology?

28:29.712 --> 28:30.553
Didn't have him.

28:30.574 --> 28:35.121
I had, in rural soc, I had a man that still lives here in town.

28:36.162 --> 28:36.523
Barden?

28:36.983 --> 28:37.785
Barden Nelson.

28:38.987 --> 28:40.128
Describe him as a teacher.

28:42.612 --> 28:47.680
Well, a good man, knew his discipline pretty well, but

28:48.368 --> 28:50.331
Pretty easy to catch a nap in there.

28:58.461 --> 29:00.984
What have we left out about your student days?

29:01.325 --> 29:03.287
What have we not touched on that we should have?

29:07.894 --> 29:08.955
Well, that's a good question.

29:09.616 --> 29:13.020
Let's see, were there any sad moments?

29:13.040 --> 29:16.705
I can't think of any tragedies, fires, bombings,

29:17.900 --> 29:27.609
Oh, while I was a freshman, that's when they drowned out, I mean, they flooded the old military science building on Military Walk.

29:28.951 --> 29:32.254
I think they had water to the windowsills in that thing.

29:32.514 --> 29:33.035
How?

29:33.055 --> 29:35.177
I don't, well, I don't know all the particulars.

29:35.257 --> 29:41.563
I guess it pulled all of the commode heads, and I've forgotten what precipitated that.

29:42.164 --> 29:44.066
But I think they vacated that building.

29:44.246 --> 29:45.527
Was it supposedly a prank?

29:47.465 --> 29:55.192
Well, it was certainly a prank, but I think it must have been... And it went a lot worse than they... It went worse than a prank.

29:57.814 --> 29:59.616
Oh, it was a major, major flood.

29:59.696 --> 30:04.340
I think that happened when I was a freshman, but I'm not sure about that.

30:05.481 --> 30:12.687
That building is about, well, almost where the flagpole is now, but out bordered on the military walk there.

30:12.767 --> 30:17.151
Seems to me like it was maybe next to the...

30:17.688 --> 30:21.435
Where the Y, no, it'd be one over from them.

30:21.456 --> 30:35.063
Yeah, it'd be the next, it's on military walks, it'd be the next one over from the Y. Any world or national events that you remember where you were when you heard the news that?

30:35.604 --> 30:36.726
Oh my goodness.

30:38.900 --> 30:44.265
See, for me... Oh, I'd have to see what might have happened in those years.

30:44.325 --> 30:48.910
Not a Kennedy assassination, not a Pearl Harbor, not an A-bomb.

30:50.451 --> 30:52.673
Korea's over, so not that.

30:53.975 --> 30:56.377
No assassination of a president or attempted.

31:00.401 --> 31:06.647
They were relatively good times, I guess you'd say, other than the drought in Texas was a very negative.

31:06.667 --> 31:08.569
It had a lot of people on the ropes.

31:09.292 --> 31:18.122
I think there were relatively good economic times coming out of a horrible decade before.

31:19.463 --> 31:26.170
What are the qualities of being an Aggie?

31:33.819 --> 31:37.763
Well, I guess I always like to say that

31:41.320 --> 31:45.908
Aggies know how to accept other people for the traits they bring to the table with them.

31:46.869 --> 31:47.911
Hopefully we do.

31:47.951 --> 32:01.354
That by and large I think they are recognize the spiritual side of their existence in this old planet.

32:04.034 --> 32:28.303
In some sense, I know a lot of, they talk about us sometimes being racist or whatever kinds of terms you can have, but I've really always found, at least when I was here as a student, and in most instances, later experiences, that people tend to be judged for the qualities they bring to the table with them.

32:28.722 --> 32:36.333
and not on the basis of who their mom and dad was or how much money they have or what kind of clothes they wear.

32:36.833 --> 32:43.002
It's basically who they are as a person that people are interested in them as a person.

32:45.065 --> 32:54.578
The core experience is one of helping you learn how to control your emotions

32:56.009 --> 33:07.048
Probably helping you learn how to have some really deep emotions about some things, but also how to control emotions.

33:10.370 --> 33:15.274
And I think just a can-do spirit that, to me, seems to pervade.

33:15.294 --> 33:24.162
I think that's, as I talk to potential graduate students or things today, I try to say I think it's a friendly environment.

33:24.283 --> 33:25.924
I think it's a can-do environment.

33:26.184 --> 33:32.490
I think you'll be accepted for who you are and how you perform in this setting.

33:33.751 --> 33:40.377
And hopefully you leave with the confidence of being able to perform, to lead.

33:41.437 --> 33:49.965
Are there some events during an Aggie undergraduate experience that helped to create this Aggie spirit?

33:50.746 --> 33:55.350
And if so, what are those events?

33:57.292 --> 34:10.684
Well, some of them are not so true anymore as they were in those days, but eating as a family in the mess hall, day in and day out, is probably one.

34:13.212 --> 34:37.700
The camaraderie that, and this could be any place, but the camaraderie that develops in classes, particularly in a setting where so many classes have a laboratory component, there's a lot of close person-to-person interaction, cooperation, even before, quote, learning as a team became a thing to do.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.522
You did a lot of it.

34:39.822 --> 34:42.325
If you function in laboratories, there is a lot of

34:43.013 --> 34:47.618
kind of team, you help me, I'll help you learn how to do things.

34:48.839 --> 35:11.483
And the traditions, of course, of silver taps and muster and yell practice and bonfire, all of those kind of contribute to building that sense of community.

35:11.503 --> 35:12.784
And the last question.

35:14.418 --> 35:24.768
What feelings do you have in your heart for Texas A&M?

35:24.788 --> 35:38.121
Well, I guess I try to express that sometimes to students in my class and saying that I know that Texas A&M is not the best university in the country.

35:38.581 --> 35:41.404
I don't think that.

35:42.903 --> 35:44.344
There are a lot of good universities.

35:45.426 --> 35:53.474
I think it is truly a unique one and I like it for a lot of that uniqueness.

35:54.234 --> 36:07.948
It's on the whole a conservative place and probably personally I lean more on the liberal side than the conservative and yet I'm very comfortable in that environment.

36:10.342 --> 36:15.770
There's a strong sense of belonging, of being loyal to each other.

36:19.215 --> 36:25.484
I think the way former students contribute, for example, and part of those things is indicative of that.

36:26.185 --> 36:31.093
You just, it's, I think it's hard, and I've observed it for years in graduate students that come here.

36:32.855 --> 36:40.146
Many, many of our graduate students leave here having received undergraduate degrees at Wisconsin or Purdue or

36:41.003 --> 36:45.970
a lot of other places that are very, very fine institutions.

36:45.990 --> 36:53.981
You might say, as a university, a stronger university of ours, if you're going to judge it as a library, for example, they're a heck of a lot stronger than ours.

36:54.442 --> 37:06.940
And yet, and yet, many of those people leaving here, and I'm absolutely convinced if you ask them what university had the greatest impact on their lives is Texas A&M.

37:07.701 --> 37:09.323
And that's where they're real,

37:09.910 --> 37:14.356
loyalty is today even if they only got the doctorate degree here.

37:15.377 --> 37:21.265
And I see the same thing in faculty who come and join us who may have degrees from a lot of other places.

37:22.747 --> 37:29.736
There's a maroon pickup out there in the parking lot right now that belongs to a graduate of Texas Tech who's a member of our faculty.

37:30.917 --> 37:38.567
But, and I don't think he would hesitate a minute to tell you that being a faculty member here

37:39.323 --> 37:55.649
has impacted his life far more than, and he was a good Red Raider and did a lot of good things at Red Raider, and yet there's just that almost intangible about this place that kind of creeps in on people.

37:57.633 --> 38:06.647
You're probably one of those people yourself that have been very significantly impacted here, even though all your education's in another,

38:06.712 --> 38:11.699
So it's hard to put your finger on exactly what it is.

38:11.919 --> 38:13.061
I can't do it very well.

38:14.783 --> 38:15.744
I think it's openness.

38:15.825 --> 38:16.826
I think it's friendliness.

38:16.906 --> 38:19.970
I think it's a can-do attitude.

38:20.291 --> 38:22.674
I think it's a feeling for others.

38:24.677 --> 38:34.390
I think it's at some level, yeah, a concern to be something and do something that makes the world better for everybody.

38:36.074 --> 38:37.108
That's a good ending.
