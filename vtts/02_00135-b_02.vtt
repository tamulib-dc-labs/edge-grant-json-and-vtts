WEBVTT

00:04.233 --> 00:16.785
It was a cozy bunch of buildings approximately 
half block long in each

00:04.233 --> 00:16.785
direction. The buildings were right up to the 
sidewalk. The sidewalk was roughly 10 feet wide

00:22.791 --> 00:27.275
concrete.

00:30.759 --> 00:34.122
As you leave the campus, on the right was 
University Pharmacy or something

00:35.367 --> 00:40.956
like that. You go by that and then there was, down 
the way you got to

00:40.976 --> 00:57.403
Holick's, the cleaners and booters across the 
street. Further down was the KC and They

01:03.059 --> 01:11.088
were both headquartered over in San Antonio. 
Well, they had the Army business over there. They

01:17.996 --> 01:20.900
had a lot of business there. All right. Was the 
campus theater? It was a block west toward, right.

01:30.671 --> 01:31.632
Were they... There's a Dixie Chicken and some more 
stuff in there that didn't exist. All right, Lupo

01:38.829 --> 01:42.072
wasn't there yet, was he?

01:45.396 --> 01:46.977
Yeah, Lou came in. He was more or less on the west 
side of the street. On that corner? Yeah, he came in

01:55.405 --> 01:59.509
there a number of times before that. Okay, you were 
on an all-male campus. How often were there young

02:03.940 --> 02:10.946
ladies coming to A&M for social events or anything 
else? Well, in the fall,

02:13.108 --> 02:29.142
if there was a home football game, then there was a 
ball,

02:31.687 --> 02:44.740
for the dance

02:31.687 --> 02:44.740
on the Friday night, and it was sponsored by 
Santa's Club, which one was it? And then after the

02:44.760 --> 02:48.844
ball game, I was at the dance. I'll take the fact 
that lots of times we just went to the dance after

02:48.864 --> 02:52.928
the game. And that was held where? At Vince Pizza 
Hall. They always did a marvelous job of setting it

02:56.892 --> 03:00.275
up. They had a big But that would be after football

03:01.893 --> 03:22.495
games, beginning

03:01.893 --> 03:22.495
right in the middle of February. It would be a 
constant uh social weekend every week they

03:33.533 --> 04:03.152
uh start out with the red blood ball up at denton 
this evening because a lot of the a m activities are

03:33.533 --> 04:03.152
put into the tsc but then there'd be the cotton ball 
and

04:04.955 --> 04:09.200
Then with each of those, there'd be a Friday night 
ball. So if you say a ball, then you're talking

04:09.220 --> 04:16.349
about a Saturday night big time dance. And they 
would run until they ran out of athletes. But each

04:20.714 --> 04:25.420
regiment had its ball. And twice I was cheering on 
the Coastal Artillery Ball. Then there was a

04:29.945 --> 04:32.688
senior dance and a ring dance. Well, no. Usually 
what happened about in the end of February, there

04:35.853 --> 04:44.382
would be the sophomore ball. It might hook up to one 
side or the other of the cotton ball. Anyway, there

04:56.434 --> 05:01.759
was the sophomore ball, and then you run through 
the various organizations You could have them in

05:02.178 --> 05:10.208
there as a junior prom for the leading Friday night 
dance. And then the final ball of all was the senior

05:10.228 --> 05:18.419
ring dance. And that's when they had the big ring. 
The prospective couple put

05:24.547 --> 05:29.754
the kiss in the middle of the ring. And that's 
there. Engagement. Engagement. I was chairman of

05:33.895 --> 05:43.871
the Post-Sanctuary Ball twice and the Junior Comm 
once and the Senior Engagements.

05:47.316 --> 05:59.455
I found out that that was the spring of 43 and it was 
real nice to be in those positions because I got to

05:47.316 --> 05:59.455
go to either Fort Worth or Houston and audition in 
those orchestras. Now, were there some big name

05:59.738 --> 06:04.542
orchestras that came during those years? We 
suffered a little bit

06:04.562 --> 06:12.129
in comparison with the University of Texas. But we 
had Rand Wild and we had a number of others

06:12.930 --> 06:25.181
that were

06:12.930 --> 06:25.181
big. They weren't Ben Miller, but they were next 
number. Okay, all right. Okay, let's go back now

06:32.011 --> 06:37.919
and lead me toward your getting called to active 
duty. Well, in December of 42, they gave us, said

06:39.662 --> 06:52.220
you're now in the Invested Reserve Corps, and 
you're here to order away.

06:55.424 --> 06:56.526
That was... later part of my first semester here as 
a sophomore.

07:12.540 --> 07:21.888
I was, I was just as adaptable to staying there and 
getting all the education I could because

07:12.540 --> 07:21.888
wherever I ended up, I'd be better off.

07:23.389 --> 07:27.593
We went through then the year 42 and lots

07:28.400 --> 07:55.369
of lots of all kinds of physical conditioning a 
little more intense on the military science and we

07:28.400 --> 07:55.369
kept going with a class of 43 they left in January of 
43. We had gone through the summer of 42, both they,

08:02.895 --> 08:12.684
class 43, which was us, and myself, every other 45. 
We had all gone to school during the summer of 42,

08:13.505 --> 08:23.394
and then to spring of 43. So you were 
chronologically moving at a faster rate toward

08:25.690 --> 08:32.662
degree than you would have in peacetime? Right 
there I'll tell you another one of those stories

08:32.822 --> 08:44.521
you're going to hear about. Mitchell, I mean Hart 
Hall and Vassell Hall cross military walks on each

08:44.541 --> 08:50.972
other. There was one fellow in heart that was just a 
particularly obnoxious character. And you

09:00.471 --> 09:13.446
might, you wonder a little bit on how the core 
discipline itself, but this guy was just really a

09:00.471 --> 09:13.446
first-class bad-ass. So, it got to be the middle of 
the summer, the temperature was just higher in

09:13.466 --> 09:20.233
Maryland, No air conditioning, no going, no 
relief coming. And this guy, he'd come in in the

09:25.271 --> 09:32.178
middle of the night and make a lot of racket. Nobody 
would live with him if he was by himself. And he

09:37.304 --> 09:41.889
didn't even put a mattress cover on his mattress. 
He'd come in and make a lot of racket from slamming

09:41.909 --> 09:45.513
around. And then he'd fall on the cot and go to 
sleep. Well, this guy lived there a little bit

09:49.077 --> 09:50.338
older. So they have

09:51.415 --> 10:17.630
contrived to go over there and pick up some fine 
wire and

09:51.415 --> 10:17.630
wire it up on the screen and then line that wire 
clear across over to Brazil. And they went back

10:17.650 --> 10:19.633
then and So they waited

10:19.900 --> 10:32.420
until the time was right. That's

10:32.440 --> 10:46.583
when they knew he was in and the door was shut while 
they pulled the line tight to the skyrocket on

10:32.440 --> 10:46.583
there. the eyes on the sky rocket, set it off, and 
that sky rocket whooshed, you know, and it went

10:47.795 --> 10:58.167
through that screen like it wasn't anything 
there. Got inside and the rockets going around and

10:58.688 --> 11:16.148
around, all kind of fire techniques and 
everything, you know, the guy screaming bloody

10:58.688 --> 11:16.148
murder, let him out of there, you know, and finally 
go boom, you know.

11:17.225 --> 11:21.710
Now you didn't have any part in that, you just, you 
were just aware of it. I just heard about that. Oh, I

11:24.433 --> 11:25.995
tell you that. He got his couple come up. As we're 
approaching 1942 and 43, did the coursework,

11:29.980 --> 11:43.676
academic coursework that y'all were assigned, 
did that change because of the war? No. No, of

11:46.081 --> 11:48.724
course, I've taken mechanical engineering. So 
you were still in engineering, and you took the

11:48.744 --> 11:53.550
normal courses that an engineering student would 
have taken. Yeah, and things progressed along. I

11:58.336 --> 12:03.602
think we covered the social thing until the spring 
of 43. Every weekend, there was two balls.

12:08.468 --> 12:14.755
But we went into the last semester, of course, We 
had no idea the school didn't need it. Well, as you

12:21.054 --> 12:43.442
got close to the end of the semester, this would be 
like, well, in March of 43, the Army sent for all of

12:21.054 --> 12:43.442
us in the class of 44 and all of us in the class of 45 to 
go and be actually inducted into the Army. Up until

12:47.971 --> 12:50.675
then, we'd been in a reserve corps. We were 
inducted into the Army. Now, how and where was that

12:52.418 --> 12:53.740
done? Well, they put us up in different places. 
There was Camp Colt, Louisiana, Camp Beauregard,

12:59.348 --> 13:05.117
Fort Walters.

13:08.101 --> 13:13.429
In my case, I went to Fort St. Houston, San Antonio. 
In each case, why, we went to these, they had a crew

13:14.320 --> 13:25.351
train, crew train cars and all this. When did you 
leave the campus for that? Oh, one day in the middle

13:30.796 --> 13:36.181
of the week. Did you finish, you didn't finish the 
semester in spring? Oh yeah, we went back. Oh, oh,

13:40.358 --> 13:43.162
oh, you went for that and then went back, okay. 
Well, basically all we did, we went over there and

13:43.242 --> 13:47.968
got GI uniform and all the issues. And took an oath? 
Yeah. And when were you given an Army serial

13:50.511 --> 13:54.376
number? At that time. At that time, okay. Did they 
tell you when you would be called to active duty? We

14:02.646 --> 14:04.448
didn't have any idea. We just knew it was sooner 
than it had been. Okay. About that time, President

14:09.974 --> 14:29.563
Gilchrist went into some long gone out exhausting 
efforts with the Army to give us six more weeks and

14:09.974 --> 14:29.563
it gave us

14:09.974 --> 14:29.563
four degrees. And the President really tried. I 
don't know if it was the first one. But the Army

14:36.473 --> 14:37.234
never did do that. So on May the 6th How

14:38.830 --> 14:46.641
did you learn you'd been called? Did they call all 
your group together and read it out or did you get a

14:48.063 --> 14:53.371
letter in the mail? I

14:53.411 --> 15:07.150
got an order sooner or

14:53.411 --> 15:07.150
later. I don't, you know, we were all there in a 
unit, and everybody in the unit was gone, so we just

15:09.239 --> 15:15.168
load up and go. Our units basically stayed 
together until we got over to Fort Sam Houston.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.989
Right, and did you go directly from College 
Station to Fort Sam? Yeah, they had a trip coming

15:28.009 --> 15:30.954
for us. And so you didn't go home and leave any 
civilian things? You went straight. Okay. Now, by

15:37.302 --> 15:38.784
that time, you... There was a time now between when 
we had gone after the uniforms and the others, and

15:38.824 --> 15:47.318
we knew then we were into it. All right. By this 
time, you had met a special young lady. Let's

15:50.923 --> 15:52.185
digress back off. Oh, that's way back to the NLTCU 
game in 1941. All right. How did that come about?

15:59.777 --> 16:01.660
Well... This was a court trip? It was a Corps trip to 
Fort Worth in 1941.

16:12.715 --> 16:21.305
I was there and we marched in the parade and went to 
the game and we won in Canada. And when I got back

16:22.486 --> 16:29.314
home, I had not planned to do anything. But there 
was an A&M Corps dance after Texas Hotel. And these

16:35.525 --> 16:47.241
freshman friends of mine, I was a sophomore, these 
freshman friends of mine who, one of them had lived

16:35.525 --> 16:47.241
in Fort Worth before.

16:50.185 --> 17:02.541
There were three of them and they decided they 
wanted to go to, they had dates from TSCW to go to

16:50.185 --> 17:02.541
the dance. And they said, come on, go. I said, oh, 
I'm out of my girlfriends. All my high school

17:07.404 --> 17:09.826
girlfriends are gone. They said, oh, come on. So I 
found a girl that I knew. Never had a date with her

17:16.753 --> 17:20.677
before or since. But anyway, she accepted the 
date. So those guys came by, and just fairly dark.

17:32.170 --> 18:00.102
Now

17:32.170 --> 18:00.102
she

17:32.170 --> 18:00.102
was another guy's date? And I slammed that door and 
said, wait a minute, I've got to put myself

18:00.453 --> 18:05.920
together. Well,

18:05.940 --> 18:17.774
fortunately, she and I, although I had a date with 
this other girl and she had a date with another guy,

18:05.940 --> 18:17.774
she and I really had a good time. And she was from 
where? Little Rock. Little Rock. She was going to

18:20.477 --> 18:21.859
school at Denton. Oh, she was at TSCW, okay. And 
then after that, how did you all communicate with

18:24.722 --> 18:28.587
each other? Well, the U.S. Mail had a lot to do with 
it. I could get a letter in the college station post

18:33.526 --> 18:46.357
office at 10 p.m. And she would have it at 9 a.m. 
Because of the railroad. Yeah. And she could tell

18:47.438 --> 18:58.708
you how she passed chemistry because she would 
send me the formulas. And I would balance the

18:59.093 --> 19:05.720
equations and send them back to her. And I could do 
all that in the time frame. She made a good grading

19:09.344 --> 19:11.486
counselor. And how often did you call her on the 
telephone? Oh, gee. The phone was expensive and

19:16.952 --> 19:18.774
hard to get.

19:23.739 --> 19:26.062
I don't even think once a month. Do you remember the 
first time she came to College Station? Oh, yeah.

19:30.387 --> 19:32.671
How long after that first dance was that? Well, I 
think there was a blind weekend in there, and then I

19:34.434 --> 19:54.227
think it was three weeks later, the SMU game, and 
the fellow who had originally dated her in Fort

19:34.434 --> 19:54.227
Worth I had

19:54.747 --> 20:15.310
invited her to come to the dance, come down for the 
weekend and do a dance there at the Lansing Museum.

20:15.330 --> 20:20.035
Well, she came over to my door and said, you know, I 
don't think I'm going to have her dance. I just

20:20.055 --> 20:21.817
don't feel like it. I said, oh, don't do that. She'd 
never been here before and it broke her heart. I

20:28.101 --> 20:31.764
said, I'll help you out. So I did. Was it normal for 
the young man to pay for the railroad ticket? Well,

20:40.471 --> 20:41.472
no. Actually, they came on a bus. It was a charter 
bus out of town. It ran to all those kind of events.

20:49.719 --> 20:52.281
And where did they stay in College Station? Well, 
wherever they were. Aggie could find a place for

20:53.776 --> 20:57.160
them. Now the Aggie paid for that. The Aggieland 
Inn was a hotel directly across west from Spesa.

21:08.373 --> 21:10.236
And it could accommodate about how many? I never 
knew, but I guess more than 15. Where else near the

21:14.040 --> 21:15.622
campus? Where else? You just had to find a 
professor or... Because there was no hotel or

21:21.181 --> 21:27.149
motel near the campus, was there? No. That's what I 
thought. There was a couple of hotels in Brown, but

21:32.496 --> 21:36.501
they were a long way away. I never had a date down 
there before. Anyway, this boy had it all already

21:40.186 --> 21:46.013
lined up, so I helped him. All right. When, in 
today's terminology, when did you all start going

21:46.614 --> 21:50.479
steady?

21:54.543 --> 22:01.713
Well, let's just say from that time on, we kept 
track of each other. All right, and by the time you

22:02.114 --> 22:09.184
then leave for the active duty, you were serious? 
Well, let's see, I guess I was. You know, we had a war

22:15.514 --> 22:18.378
hanging over our heads all the time. But you didn't 
get, did you get married before? No, we... I had

22:24.530 --> 22:39.994
already,

22:24.530 --> 22:39.994
in the summer of 43, I

22:24.530 --> 22:39.994
had a lead from 14. And I went to Little Rock and told 
Glenn I already knew it. And so we set up to get

22:49.842 --> 23:04.398
married when I got my

22:49.842 --> 23:04.398
commission. And that was November the 18th, 1943.

23:08.743 --> 23:15.330
The other night at home with some of the fellas, one 
of the fellas. We were married in Little Rock. Came

23:16.291 --> 23:17.793
down to Fort Worth to have a couple of days. 
Michigan next evening and Texas next evening. And

23:20.639 --> 23:32.518
then two of the other fellas that were my Aggie 
friends were also to be stationed at Camp Stewart,

23:20.639 --> 23:32.518
Georgia. And so those two guys and Jane and

23:32.538 --> 23:46.840
I drove over there to the first station. And then I 
immediately applied for Air Force pilot

23:48.668 --> 23:54.035
training, and they weren't taking any 
commissioned officers. And then Jane had heard of

23:55.657 --> 24:06.270
an engineering school at Yale, Aircraft 
Engineering School, and I applied for that, and it

23:55.657 --> 24:06.270
was accepted. So we went to Yale on the 6th of 
February, 1944. And, all right. She stayed with me

24:17.508 --> 24:22.534
wherever I was in the States until I switched over 
to Japan. And you go to Japan when? I went to Japan in

24:24.677 --> 24:30.263
the fall of 1945. Okay, so you get there, the war's 
over, all right. Then you come back, let's now get

24:33.787 --> 24:36.611
back to College Station. When do you return to 
finish your degree? Well, I got, I was My time in the

24:45.031 --> 25:08.997
Air Force, I transferred to the Air Force because 
my time

24:45.031 --> 25:08.997
in

24:45.031 --> 25:08.997
the Air Force was, you know, it was August of 12th, 
July of 12th, and I had some time to leave. July and

25:09.017 --> 25:09.637
August of 45. And I had You may

25:12.014 --> 25:30.313
recall those four-plex project houses that were 
there on the southeast, southwest corner of

25:12.014 --> 25:30.313
Stamford. We were extremely fortunate to get one 
of those. And when was that? 46? August of 46. All

25:37.980 --> 25:39.642
right. Tell me how things were different in 46 
compared to before the war.

25:49.650 --> 26:02.690
Well, the campus

25:49.650 --> 26:02.690
was a big mixture. Of course, the veterans were 
wearing whatever left over clothing they had. I

26:08.680 --> 26:14.988
think they moved all of the Aggies, whatever all of 
D.C. there was at the time. Well, I know they moved

26:15.008 --> 26:16.931
the freshmen. Now, for you as a veteran, you didn't 
wear any Aggie uniform after the war. Were the

26:25.362 --> 26:28.706
project houses pretty well filled with veterans? 
Oh, they were exclusively for veterans. They were

26:33.091 --> 26:35.835
first-class, brand-new accommodations. Were 
there also some trailers and other temporary? Not

26:40.695 --> 26:41.496
on the campus. Not on the campus. OK. And by and 
large, were the veterans at A&M, were most of them

26:42.778 --> 26:55.077
Aggies from before the war that were coming back to 
finish? Oh, yeah. OK. Were there ever any

26:58.142 --> 27:03.730
incidents you remember between those of you who 
went away And the 19-year-old nerd that had never

27:04.064 --> 27:11.070
had any part in the war, were there any incidents? 
No. Okay.

27:14.493 --> 27:23.961
And was there a difference you'd felt in the 
attitude of the veteran about getting the degree

27:14.493 --> 27:23.961
compared to before the war? Oh, yeah. The degree or 
determination was just immeasurable. I could

27:32.349 --> 27:33.970
cite to you a number of cases. where a guy before the 
war had done just a full report. He just didn't give

27:40.757 --> 27:44.704
a damn about class, and somehow they let him stay 
in. He didn't care what the end was up or what. And he

27:49.131 --> 28:00.649
came back, and don't know if he didn't whiz through 
getting a degree, and went on time, and went on to

27:49.131 --> 28:00.649
have a very fine business career. The GI Bill is one 
of the greatest things that ever happened. You

28:06.219 --> 28:06.960
betcha. You betcha. The guess is that the 
recipient of the GI Bill has paid back in extra

28:09.883 --> 28:22.997
income taxes that he wouldn't have earned 27 times 
as much as he receives. So that's a win-win both

28:23.478 --> 28:25.119
ways. I only got a... I only got one semester of 
living there on the campus, and I never did collect

28:28.372 --> 28:41.824
any school tuition or airplane training or 
anything like that. That's all I got. It's not

28:42.224 --> 28:42.825
short. While you and the other veterans were 
students, what were your wives doing in those

28:43.045 --> 28:47.589
years? Well, Jan had a son that was...

28:48.630 --> 28:56.877
Jan was... Okay, so she's busy being a mother. Were 
there student wives working all over the campus?

29:14.761 --> 29:15.241
Let's see. Tell me about silver taps during your 
student days. Was it held? Where?

29:29.324 --> 29:53.530
The givers would be up on

29:29.324 --> 29:53.530
top of the academic building, and it would be, 
they'd let them go, they'd let them go around, and

29:29.324 --> 29:53.530
they'd let it fall out, and outside

29:29.324 --> 29:53.530
they'd go on, and be there for the ceremony. There 
was no, there was no enunciation, since

29:58.535 --> 30:26.365
you your final semester or so you were not in the 
core you didn't go through a final review as a

29:58.535 --> 30:26.365
senior did you oh did you describe it where was it 
held but

30:27.256 --> 30:50.799
What

30:27.256 --> 30:50.799
about Aggie Muster in those days? Very informal. 
Held where? To tell you the truth, I don't remember

30:56.180 --> 31:00.466
one on the campus. The first muster I became 
acquainted with was when I was working

31:00.486 --> 31:17.650
in Houston about 1950. And it was basically a beer 
busted swimming club. So that's gotten much more

31:20.875 --> 31:22.697
serious. Oh, yeah. It's gotten far more serious. 
Were you there when some of the corrections
