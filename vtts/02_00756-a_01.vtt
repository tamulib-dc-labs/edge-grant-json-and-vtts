00:03.727 --> 00:12.301
Has there been, over the years, a substantial 
increase in students in the field of poultry

00:03.727 --> 00:12.301
husbandry? And has there been a change in the 
background of the students? By background, I

00:17.269 --> 00:22.859
would have to say, let me preface that by saying a 
geographical background. Have they come from

00:22.879 --> 00:25.583
different areas of the world? Well, of course, I 
inherited, when I took over the department, I

00:26.120 --> 00:38.072
inherited no records.

00:38.092 --> 00:47.401
And so it's not going to be easy for me to answer that 
accurately. But in terms of numbers of students,

00:52.546 --> 01:09.206
there has distinctly been an increase in numbers 
of students, both undergraduate, but

00:52.546 --> 01:09.206
particularly at the graduate level.

01:09.467 --> 01:21.321
We have, since

01:09.467 --> 01:21.321
about 1950,

01:09.467 --> 01:21.321
we have probably had more graduate students in the 
poetry department at Texas A&M University than

01:22.246 --> 01:28.675
any other institution in the United States. I 
don't think there's any challenge, even a

01:29.116 --> 01:33.021
beginning challenge there. And so that the 
increase in students has majorly been at the

01:34.704 --> 01:48.203
graduate level.

01:48.436 --> 01:53.005
Has this increase been primarily students from 
the United States or from abroad? They've been

01:53.225 --> 01:54.648
both, both. Yes, indeed, they've been both. Now 
the undergraduate students, there's just been a

01:58.275 --> 02:05.849
smattering of foreign undergraduate students. 
They mostly take their undergraduate degrees at

02:05.869 --> 02:09.516
home. and then come here for graduate work. So most 
of the foreign students have been taking courses

02:13.116 --> 02:19.283
at the graduate level. I believe earlier you were 
telling me something about the reason why there

02:21.846 --> 02:33.540
has been this tremendous increase in interest in 
poultry

02:21.846 --> 02:33.540
production around the world. And maybe you can 
elaborate on that now. something about trying to

02:36.833 --> 02:42.381
get more protein into the diet. Yes. Well, most of 
the so-called developing nations, we have called

02:43.723 --> 02:58.084
them by different names in the last 15 years, but 
the common term now is developing nations. Most of

02:58.684 --> 03:04.613
the developing nations have their protein source 
in the first place they have been inadequate in the

03:04.593 --> 03:24.255
amount of protein they have had available for 
human consumption and then secondly the major

03:04.593 --> 03:24.255
portion of that protein has been from plant 
sources and most plant proteins other than soy

03:24.235 --> 03:39.855
soybean meal or soy, almost all of the plant 
proteins are deficient in lysine, which is one of

03:24.235 --> 03:39.855
the required essential amino acids, required or 
essential amino acids. It cannot be synthesized

03:40.235 --> 03:43.780
by man himself. And another one is methionine, and 
it cannot be synthesized by man, so it has to be

03:43.760 --> 03:55.997
dietarily provided.

03:57.192 --> 04:18.762
So, these two being low in most of the plant 
proteins that these people had available to them

03:57.192 --> 04:18.762
has meant that they have, in some cases, they have 
actually not had taken full advantage, not been

03:57.192 --> 04:18.762
able to take full advantage are the amount of 
protein they had because of the limitations of

04:18.742 --> 04:25.415
these two particular amino acids. See, they 
couldn't take it from the diet. A human being can't

04:27.098 --> 04:34.152
take the diet, the protein from the diet, 
synthesize it into human protein. by any more than

04:34.132 --> 04:45.066
the limiting, the amino acid that is the lowest, 
the acquired amino acid that's the lowest. And so

04:45.667 --> 04:59.464
for that reason, they have had, I figured a few 
years ago when I was in Bangladesh, I figured at

04:45.667 --> 04:59.464
that time that actually they were throwing away 
are actually using for energy 17% of the protein

04:59.444 --> 05:10.097
they consumed because they didn't have enough 
lysine. And so since meat proteins or animal

05:10.117 --> 05:27.358
proteins are quite high, or animal foods are quite 
high in these two particular amino acids, these

05:10.117 --> 05:27.358
developing countries have been anxious to 
improve their dietary balance by introducing

05:27.338 --> 05:40.352
some animal protein into their consumption now 
many of them what animal protein they get is fish

05:40.771 --> 05:43.997
But there's a limit to how much fish is available. 
In some countries that are not close to the sea,

05:44.017 --> 05:53.716
they can't even take advantage of fish as being one 
of their animal proteins. And so as a result of it,

05:54.357 --> 06:03.775
they have looked to methods of producing animal 
protein and introducing it into their diet. Since

06:04.919 --> 06:23.012
poultry is at the present time the most efficient 
of the common domestic animals, it is the most

06:04.919 --> 06:23.012
efficient converter of feed to food protein that 
we have. And so as a result of it, they have looked to

06:24.173 --> 06:46.621
poultry as being a way of supplementing their 
human diet without robbing their feed supplies,

06:24.173 --> 06:46.621
which some of them are capable of being used for 
human food. And so that has created a national,

06:47.162 --> 06:53.370
international interest in poultry. in poultry as 
a supplier of animal protein for improving the

06:54.160 --> 07:06.435
diets of these developing nations. In fact, I was 
contacted about two weeks ago by one of the men who

07:06.475 --> 07:21.012
had been called by the

07:23.118 --> 07:26.662
administrator of Saudi Arabia. And they, as you 
know, the last few years, most of those

07:27.483 --> 07:36.213
Mid-Eastern countries have all the money they 
want. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, etc. They have,

07:40.738 --> 07:45.784
because of the increase in oil prices, they have 
all kinds of money. But agriculture-wise, they

07:46.523 --> 07:49.427
are very deficient. But they do have the money to 
buy from outside, if they can get it to buy. But most

07:55.095 --> 08:06.550
of their people, their rulers, they do not want to 
depend upon continuous importation of their

07:55.095 --> 08:06.550
food. They want to develop their own agriculture 
so that... They can be self-sufficient, or at

08:12.713 --> 08:21.588
least more so in the future than they are at the 
present time. And so they were looking into the

08:22.048 --> 08:35.110
possibility of recruiting a team of American 
scientists who could go over there and develop,

08:22.048 --> 08:35.110
establish a poultry industry in the country. and 
set it up so that it could continue to operate after

08:35.090 --> 08:44.024
the scientists had finished their job. And this is 
being done in New Orleans. Last week at the World's

08:48.771 --> 08:59.308
Party Congress, I was contacted by the man who is in 
charge of the agricultural development for Iraq.

09:00.048 --> 09:15.441
and about the possibility of availability for 
coming over for government consulting work in the

09:00.048 --> 09:15.441
attempt to develop a poultry industry for their 
country. I hope it develops. He'll find somebody

09:17.385 --> 09:18.987
to do it. I don't know who it'll be, but he'll find it 
because money is no—he actually spent nine

09:19.047 --> 09:37.952
million dollars for equipment while he was in New 
Orleans in the exhibit area of the World's

09:19.047 --> 09:37.952
Congress last week. Money's not a problem. No, so 
money's not a problem, right. Has the number of

09:42.117 --> 10:03.197
foreign students from developing countries in 
your graduate program had some influence on the

09:42.117 --> 10:03.197
makeup of the coursework and the requirements for 
a degree, let us say? No, I don't believe so,

10:05.675 --> 10:13.086
because we have tended to have a pretty good 
balance. This, of course, is maybe a prejudiced

10:13.106 --> 10:23.481
opinion, but we think we have a very good balance 
both between courses and of the subject matter

10:23.731 --> 10:48.810
within a given course between the basic material, 
which will work anywhere in the world, and applied

10:23.731 --> 10:48.810
material, which can be used for application to the 
specific problems of producing and feeding and

10:23.731 --> 10:48.810
marketing poultry. And as a result, it has not been 
necessary for us to do a great modification. Well,

10:55.298 --> 11:04.590
I think earlier you indicated that

10:55.298 --> 11:04.590
many of the students which you produce are really 
kind of generalists rather than specialists. And

11:04.630 --> 11:17.025
I was wondering if all of your students had been 
from highly developed countries, if you possibly

11:04.630 --> 11:17.025
would have developed more specialists and fewer 
generalists. No, I think because of the trend we

11:18.068 --> 11:23.112
have been going through. See, we have been, in the 
United States, our units of production have been

11:23.172 --> 11:34.582
getting bigger and fewer. And most of the board of 
directors of an integrated operation want one man

11:35.703 --> 11:47.974
who knows whether this special man, the manager of 
the processing plant, is doing a good job or not. He

11:55.155 --> 12:03.870
also wants to know, wants somebody who can tell him 
or check for him whether this man that's running

11:55.155 --> 12:03.870
the feed mill is doing a good job. And so for that 
reason, domestically, the last 15 years, there's

12:04.677 --> 12:20.314
been a much richer demand for these generalists 
and management and production people than there

12:04.677 --> 12:20.314
were before. And now we're at that stage where I 
think we're going to start going back toward more

12:21.315 --> 12:29.824
specialization. And the foreign countries, the 
developing countries particularly, they can't

12:30.125 --> 12:38.245
afford a geneticist, a nutritionist, and a market 
technologist, and a physiologist in every one of

12:38.444 --> 12:52.477
their operations. And so what they're trying to do 
is to get a little shallower training, but get all

12:52.958 --> 13:08.012
of these disciplines, a workable level of all of 
these disciplines in one man, one or two men, you

12:52.958 --> 13:08.012
see. And so for that reason, I think that explains 
why there's been this number of students

13:07.992 --> 13:21.899
in this area, in this generalized area. Okay.

13:27.249 --> 13:28.431
Earlier you indicated that that during your first 
teaching at A&M, you did some summer research with

13:28.715 --> 13:38.913
vitamin deficiencies, perhaps in rats. Have you 
continued the work with vitamin deficiencies

13:40.876 --> 13:46.506
since then? I mean, did you switch over to 
chickens, vitamin needs for chickens, later on

13:46.546 --> 13:54.199
when you came back? Yes, yes indeed. All of my work 
since I came back from away, while I was there and

13:56.392 --> 14:07.624
since I have come back, all of my work has been with 
poetry in one form or another. I've done no work

14:08.225 --> 14:13.230
with other animals since then.

14:16.394 --> 14:23.241
What would you say had been some of the more 
important research that you had done

14:25.499 --> 14:27.041
since 1946?

14:28.964 --> 14:35.033
Well, this gives me an opportunity to brag an awful 
lot. I hope you won't consider it to be too much so,

14:35.374 --> 14:40.301
but it may sound that way. That's what I'm trying to 
lay the foundation for. Please don't The others

14:47.116 --> 14:50.600
have worked along the same lines and so on. And so 
much of the work has been done by graduate students

14:51.220 --> 14:59.149
and by other staff people and so on. And for that 
reason, I will mention only those areas where I

14:59.710 --> 15:12.904
think we have made at least some original 
contribution to the area, that's all. And I

15:12.884 --> 15:36.669
believe that one of these areas has been the 
development of the idea that for laying hens, we

15:12.884 --> 15:36.669
need to do, for optimum performance and for most 
economical cost of that performance, that

15:12.884 --> 15:36.669
so-called phase feeding is essential. Now, we've 
always phase fed broilers. In other words, we

15:39.952 --> 15:46.482
sometimes have a pre-starter, then a starter, and 
then a finisher diet. But at least if we don't have a

15:46.502 --> 15:50.568
pre-starter, we have a starter and a finisher. Now 
that's only eight weeks. We market our broilers

15:51.830 --> 15:55.916
usually at eight weeks, plus or minus a few days. 
And so this has been accepted. But the tendency up

16:00.182 --> 16:08.575
until a few years ago, the tendency was to 
establish one ration for laying hens and feed this

16:08.555 --> 16:15.004
same ration until the hens had finished their 
production period and were discarded. Actually,

16:16.085 --> 16:35.811
in the winter months we need more energy to keep 
their body temperature up and in the summertime we

16:16.085 --> 16:35.811
need to reduce the energy because the body 
temperature is The environmental temperature,

16:36.854 --> 16:41.620
they lose no heat to the environment, you see. So 
that's what I mean by this phase feeding, just one

16:42.120 --> 16:46.465
element. There's many elements of it. But we need 
to change the ratio of protein to energy, for

16:49.509 --> 16:56.777
example, according to the season. Wintertime, we 
have more energy, less protein. In the summer,

17:01.002 --> 17:05.427
we'll have the same daily consumption. But the 
ratio is what I'm talking about here. Protein,

17:08.752 --> 17:11.115
perhaps, is needed in both seasons. But the ratio 
of energy to protein is higher in the wintertime

17:11.736 --> 17:17.364
and lower in the summer. And the same thing is true 
of calcium, the feed consumption. Our data, we fed

17:24.133 --> 17:32.545
birds individually, and we find that in the 
summertime they may eat only 90 to 95 grams of feed.

17:32.525 --> 17:38.542
Whereas in the wintertime, the feed consumption, 
the same diet, may go up to 115, 120 grams. Well now,

17:38.602 --> 17:47.547
if you're only going to get 90 grams, and the bird's 
laying at the same rate and she's consuming 115

17:38.602 --> 17:47.547
grams, naturally there's got to be some changes 
not just in energy and protein but there's also got

17:47.527 --> 18:04.287
to be some changes in calcium because they've got 
to lay down shells around those eggs and there's

17:47.527 --> 18:04.287
got to be a change in vitamin level because you've 
got to get enough vitamin out of 90 grams And over

18:04.267 --> 18:12.804
here, if you put enough in 90 grams and you put the 
same level in 115 grams, you're wasting a lot of it

18:04.267 --> 18:12.804
down there. So in order for economy, we've simply 
got to go to this so-called phase feeding. Now,

18:20.365 --> 18:31.393
another area where we entered about five years 
ago, we find that we can do more economical feeding

18:20.365 --> 18:31.393
if we control the feed intake. That birds will 
tend, laying birds will tend to overconsume,

18:31.414 --> 18:37.429
consume more than they need to. And gain a little 
extra body weight. Well, the more body weight they

18:39.492 --> 18:44.280
gain, the more the maintenance requirement to 
maintain that body, see? So if we can keep their

18:44.620 --> 18:53.474
body weight down a little bit, we actually make 
more, the cost of feed makes up about two-thirds of

18:44.620 --> 18:53.474
the total cost of producing eggs. So we can do that. 
We had a paper that was reported in New Orleans at

18:55.357 --> 18:59.704
the World Congress last week. it attracted a lot of 
attention. They took up the time for two papers to

19:03.289 --> 19:07.834
ask questions in this area. There were some other 
papers from other countries in the same area. So we

19:12.220 --> 19:22.212
think perhaps here is another area in which we have 
also made some contribution to this. I hadn't had a

19:23.214 --> 19:25.877
chance to think about...

19:29.013 --> 19:35.513
Could

19:29.013 --> 19:35.513
you stop the...

19:38.446 --> 20:00.691
Another area in which we have worked fairly 
extensively here, and we should do it because we

19:38.446 --> 20:00.691
produce a tremendous amount of grain sorghum in 
this state, and so we have done a lot of feeding of

19:38.446 --> 20:00.691
grain sorghum to poultry, particularly layers. 
Most of my research program has been with layers.

20:03.674 --> 20:24.535
And so we have fed different varieties, different 
colors, that is yellow versus red, and the bird

20:03.674 --> 20:24.535
resistant, we've tested the bird resistant, the 
so-called bird resistant Milo, whether it

20:03.674 --> 20:24.535
actually reduces performance of layers and so on 
or not. I don't know that you've seen it, but there

20:24.515 --> 20:37.868
was about two or three years ago, there was a book 
published on the production and utilization of

20:24.515 --> 20:37.868
grain sorghums. And Dr. Tanksley at Animal 
Science and I were asked to write a chapter on the

20:37.888 --> 20:51.000
feeding of grain sorghums to swine, to poultry, 
and to swine, or to swine and poultry. And so there

20:51.580 --> 20:54.403
is a... as a result of the published material on 
grain sorghum feeding, there is this, and there

20:54.383 --> 21:05.301
are reprints available on this chapter that we 
have. Now, we tried a few years ago, I'm going to

21:07.925 --> 21:21.167
mention this, although it resulted in no 
practical application, a few years ago, I was very

21:07.925 --> 21:21.167
much interested in... how we could improve the 
survival of the poultry embryo from day old, from

21:22.244 --> 21:35.646
the time of setting of the egg, to 21 days when they 
hatch. And so we developed a plastic shell. It's in

21:42.849 --> 21:50.397
two pieces, and it's clear and has a snap on cover. 
And so we got a mold made and had these made for us by

21:51.018 --> 21:59.507
one of the companies in Fort Worth, plastic 
companies. And we tried to use this, we put the

21:59.487 --> 22:13.804
shell, take the egg out of the shell and put it into 
this plastic shell and then put it in the incubator

21:59.487 --> 22:13.804
to try to make it develop. Well, we just don't know, 
and I suspected this might be the case, but we just

22:13.824 --> 22:26.659
don't know enough biology at the present time to 
take that all the way through to 21 days. This is

22:27.921 --> 22:32.368
what I'd like to do, would be to take it all the way 
through to 21 days. Then we could check it for

22:32.729 --> 22:43.045
injections, the effects of different additives, 
feed additives, whether they were toxic or

22:32.729 --> 22:43.045
non-toxic, etc. Just many, many uses could be made 
of this. About all the value it was, or is at this

22:47.092 --> 23:03.666
time to us, or proved to be, we've discontinued any 
interest in it right this minute, but the

22:47.092 --> 23:03.666
youngsters all over the country used this plastic 
eggshell. as a science project in their

23:03.646 --> 23:10.382
school work. And they put these embryos in there 
and they can watch the blood island form on the

23:10.402 --> 23:18.702
germinal disc Then they can watch the blood 
vessels form. Then they can watch the heart form,

23:22.186 --> 23:27.111
and they can see the heart beating and pumping. 
They see it's completely clear, and they can watch

23:27.472 --> 23:36.742
the heart pumping the blood out the arteries and 
back through the veins and so on. So it's been used.

23:38.264 --> 23:43.930
I've shipped those things all over the world, as a 
matter of fact, but particularly over the United

23:38.264 --> 23:43.930
States. I had one extension told him in Ohio that 
every year he would order a couple hundred of those

23:43.910 --> 24:05.867
shells, if I had that many, he'd order them every 
year to distribute to the kids in Ohio for their

23:43.910 --> 24:05.867
science, those that were interested in eggs as a 
science project. And so we've discontinued

24:05.847 --> 24:13.819
because we've gone just about as far as we can on 
this. We're just going to have to learn more

24:13.939 --> 24:17.905
biology before we can take them all the way 
through. But there's some hope that you might be

24:18.426 --> 24:20.629
able to do that someday. Oh, I don't think in a doubt 
that we'll be able to do it someday. I won't, but I

24:23.874 --> 24:27.719
won't live that long, but somebody will. Yes, 
indeed.

24:31.565 --> 24:32.867
Then we... We did some work on clay feeding, 
bentonite and clay work, and we have gotten some

24:33.337 --> 24:46.229
definite responses from feeding of clay to these 
laying hens. There's also been some reports since

24:46.950 --> 24:54.777
our first paper, there's been some reports from 
other areas for feeding it to broilers. How they

24:56.158 --> 25:00.542
get any additional response from the feed because 
it includes a little clay, I do not know. And I will

25:06.473 --> 25:17.353
never have time to really determine one of the 
suspicions I have as to why. I have a feeling that

25:17.774 --> 25:23.965
probably these clays are extremely fine 
particles, most of the clays. And I have a feeling

25:23.945 --> 25:40.682
that the nutrients coat these clay particles and 
that gives a greater surface exposure to the villi

25:23.945 --> 25:40.682
on the lining of the digestive tract so that the 
absorption rate is perhaps higher. I don't know

25:40.902 --> 25:46.427
that this is it, but I'd like to be able to test it. 
And I got far enough to get a company that said they

25:46.447 --> 25:53.074
would make me clays of different glands. granular 
sizes so I could do it. I may get back to it in my

25:57.065 --> 26:07.131
retirement days and further test it, but that's as 
far as we've gone on that. And then there's two

26:07.820 --> 26:17.374
other areas that I'd definitely like to mention 
that I think we've made some fairly original

26:07.820 --> 26:17.374
contributions. One is that quite a number of years 
ago, we fed to these laying hens, we fed... eggs. We

26:30.951 --> 26:36.383
simply took the feed and then put in the equivalent 
of one egg per man per day. Two eggs, three eggs,

26:36.583 --> 26:41.192
four eggs, seven eggs, and ten eggs per man per day. 
And fed these hens for a full year. on this to

26:45.822 --> 26:54.172
determine about this cholesterol thing that we 
hear so much about, particularly in the medical

26:45.822 --> 26:54.172
profession. Well, we actually found that the 
higher the level of eggs we included, the better

26:54.192 --> 27:03.382
the performance of the birds and the lower the 
mortality.

27:08.148 --> 27:12.673
I don't think there's any doubt that this is 
significant.

27:15.269 --> 27:23.839
And then the... Can

27:15.269 --> 27:23.839
we step back to that a minute? You say one egg per man 
per day. Now, do you mean per chicken? Yeah. In

27:30.247 --> 27:41.901
other words, that hen consumed in her diet, she 
consumed the amount of egg that a man would

27:30.247 --> 27:41.901
consume...

27:42.607 --> 27:43.329
in a day. I wanted to feed these hens at different 
levels of consumption, of egg consumption. So I

27:51.147 --> 27:54.315
fed them on equivalent to a man basis, you see. In 
other words, this group of hens got no eggs added.

27:59.093 --> 28:10.434
This one got the equivalent eggs added, 
equivalent to a man, an average man and woman, and

27:59.093 --> 28:10.434
the average size, consuming one egg per man per 
day. And then two and so on, up to ten eggs per man,

28:10.995 --> 28:22.637
equivalent of a man would be eating ten eggs if he 
had got as much eggs as his hen was getting, don't

28:10.995 --> 28:22.637
you see? So you would adjust for the body weight of 
the chicken. A chicken of a certain size would get a

28:29.357 --> 28:32.182
certain portion of an egg. Yes, yeah. And in other 
words, the ratio was here so we could check to see

28:34.306 --> 28:42.901
what effect these eggs had, the cholesterol in the 
eggs. There were whole eggs given to these birds.

28:51.575 --> 29:18.088
And

28:51.575 --> 29:18.088
we also did some work and were asked to report it at 
several seminars on the relation of calcium

29:19.739 --> 29:32.038
source and the particle size of the calcium, its 
relation to eggshell quality. You see, the

29:34.020 --> 29:42.013
feeding of oyster shell, for example, 
supplementary shell, would it do any good in terms

29:34.020 --> 29:42.013
of improving shell quality? And so we did, there 
were about three years' work in this area. I think

29:49.355 --> 29:52.961
this made a real contribution.

30:00.775 --> 30:07.768
Oh, we have also did quite an extensive amount of 
work feeding of dwarf or many layers, the dwarf

30:08.693 --> 30:14.442
birds versus normal birds. And we have showed that 
to get optimum performance from the dwarf birds,

30:15.104 --> 30:23.998
you have to feed a higher density diet. Their 
capacity is lower, and thus you have to increase

30:24.539 --> 30:34.195
the concentration of the nutrients in the diet 
that they get. And we were early in doing that.
