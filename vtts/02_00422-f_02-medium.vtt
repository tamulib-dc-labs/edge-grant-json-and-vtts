WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:07.547
Yeah.

00:07.567 --> 00:09.229
Well, there was a lot of suffering that went on. I 
guarantee you that in the military with Laos and

00:09.309 --> 00:13.476
Cambodia, at first you couldn't bomb. Even Swede 
Larson, I told you about, he came back to Vietnam,

00:14.738 --> 00:23.791
had been a corps commander, and he told about the 
enemy across there in the border. And he got called

00:23.812 --> 00:30.662
on the carpet and said, you got to call a press 
conference and tell them that you're mistaken.

00:31.958 --> 00:44.035
Because it wasn't in the interest of the United 
States by someone to admit that there actually

00:31.958 --> 00:44.035
were North Vietnamese utilizing Laos and 
Cambodia, you know, coming on that. So he called a

00:44.055 --> 00:45.397
news conference. He said, well, I announced that 
the State Department knows more about what's

00:45.417 --> 00:54.510
going on in Laos and Cambodia than I do. And I was 
wrong when I said there were North Vietnamese in

00:54.650 --> 01:01.780
Laos, particularly Laos. Of course, later on, we 
know that we were bombing and doing good well. But

01:08.476 --> 01:10.981
that's kind of the type of war. I go on and I'm going 
to take the town and all sorts of things, you know.

01:19.738 --> 01:24.527
Fortunately, the poor soldier down in Vietnam 
doesn't hear all these things. like if you just got

01:25.182 --> 01:31.108
killed by somebody shooting across the border, 
you know, and say, oh, I didn't come across the

01:25.182 --> 01:31.108
border. It was to the north. Were you in Vietnam, or 
not Vietnam, in the Pentagon on January 31st,

01:32.530 --> 01:41.440
1968, with a Tet Offensive? Yeah. Do you remember 
what the feeling in the Pentagon was about the Tet?

01:49.669 --> 01:53.653
Because just four or five days earlier, General 
Westmoreland had had made a major statement that

01:54.190 --> 01:59.616
we were winning and it was all downhill now, etc. 
And then all of a sudden we had Tet.

02:05.042 --> 02:19.239
Yeah, I think some were concerned about that, but I 
don't think it was as bad as the press reported,

02:05.042 --> 02:19.239
because actually Tet wasn't a victory for the 
North Vietnamese. No, it was a victory for us. It

02:23.502 --> 02:33.291
might have been embarrassing to Westmoreland to 
have sat down and have this large attack with the BC

02:23.502 --> 02:33.291
and the North enemy.

02:34.892 --> 02:45.883
There was some real good street fighting in Saigon 
by, not the combat troops, but MPs and some of them.

02:45.903 --> 02:52.969
They got into the streets of Saigon and were trying 
to get to the airfield, I'm sure, to get the

02:45.903 --> 02:52.969
Westmoreland Tent Corps. So it didn't seem to have 
that much of an impact. No. What about the riots in

02:58.341 --> 03:00.444
the United States? By 1967, 1968, there were a 
number of demonstrations against the war in

03:00.524 --> 03:07.293
Vietnam. There were even some marches across the 
bridge in the Potomac and on the Pentagon and

03:07.313 --> 03:16.265
demonstrations outside. What impact did that 
have on you and senior military officials?

03:27.121 --> 03:34.793
I guess you'd call it disgust because you should 
have seen those people, who they were, or what they

03:27.121 --> 03:34.793
looked like.

03:37.998 --> 03:45.370
Yeah, they tried, they tried to get in the, in the 
Pentagon, tried to get into the joint, yeah, and

03:37.998 --> 03:45.370
they were young. It'd be long hair, smell stink for 
any of the girls. They had intercourse right out

03:50.678 --> 03:54.664
there under the bushes.

03:56.146 --> 03:58.290
We camped out, and the girls yelled. See, we had 
soldiers who were blocking that. They'd spit on

04:02.376 --> 04:06.864
them and throw things at them and call them all 
sorts of obscene names.

04:10.490 --> 04:11.652
We kept the other entrance. Fortunately, they had 
the front entrance there rather than being in the

04:11.732 --> 04:15.238
back. So business went on as usual, and there 
didn't any of them get inside the Pentagon.

04:25.222 --> 04:30.208
Basically, the officers were disgusted by the 
situation. Is that the word? Yeah. Well, I know I

04:32.792 --> 04:48.072
was, and I think you all had to think, because it's 
different from some of the other demonstrations

04:32.792 --> 04:48.072
we've had, where you've had some clean, concerned 
citizen type of thing. But they all looked and

04:48.092 --> 04:50.014
acted like Some will admit now that the main reason 
I'm against the war is that I may have to go, or maybe

04:51.631 --> 05:01.804
I've already been called and I'm hiding out now. 
So, you're discrediting what they expected to do

05:01.824 --> 05:08.272
in the Pentagon because we aren't the ones that 
decided it. Of course, they were going to try to

05:08.612 --> 05:11.496
stop it, but I tried to stop it. the work of 
government, you know, for a day or two days, like

05:12.235 --> 05:19.788
cluttering up the streets, throwing trash cans 
out, lying down in the street. That was to keep

05:19.808 --> 05:21.331
people going to work.

05:24.356 --> 05:27.442
But I say most of the disgust was the smoking of 
marijuana. You could smell it just appalled all

05:27.742 --> 05:31.288
over that place. And I said, actually, you could 
see these characters having intercourse under

05:31.308 --> 05:37.399
the bushes.

05:41.260 --> 05:46.027
And then they camped out near the river down there. 
And they went nude and had intercourse there. You

05:48.511 --> 05:49.532
could see them from the street. So it isn't exactly 
fine, idealistic young men and women that

05:51.175 --> 06:00.108
sincerely believe. And I'm not saying they 
weren't sincere. But I don't think that's an

06:03.674 --> 06:09.883
element of society that's going to impress me, 
particularly with their conduct. Now, did the

06:10.910 --> 06:15.298
officers inside the Pentagon talk about these 
protests? Oh, sure. What was the general feeling?

06:20.287 --> 06:21.469
Just exactly as I said. And, of course, most of them 
would go a step further than I did in saying that we

06:22.170 --> 06:30.225
ought to get holes or something and push them away. 
At least they'd get clean, see?

06:38.652 --> 06:45.140
You couldn't do that, obviously, not in a Greek 
society like we have. There's another thing I was

06:45.160 --> 06:48.424
wondering about, and that is the big question. In 
your opinion, why did we lose in Vietnam?

06:59.557 --> 07:01.279
That's difficult to answer. As

07:01.299 --> 07:05.824
I've said before,

07:08.639 --> 07:12.925
the military recommended against ever getting 
involved in Vietnam. I know. And they often quoted

07:14.327 --> 07:19.776
the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.

07:23.581 --> 07:34.758
And if anyone who would look around the map on here 
and say, now, where is the worst place you possibly

07:23.581 --> 07:34.758
could find to fight a war? And you'd come to 
Southeast Asia, especially if you say, The two

07:39.689 --> 07:49.043
countries are neutral, and you will not be able to 
conduct operations there, regardless of what

07:39.689 --> 07:49.043
happens. Now look at this long, thin mass, see, 
with this unnatural line drawn up here that's

07:49.063 --> 07:59.017
going to be north and south. And you go, who's the 
enemy? Where are they? Well, they're north of

08:04.445 --> 08:06.188
Vietnam. No, they're not. They're not down there, 
because that was our position. There are no North

08:09.507 --> 08:11.129
Vietnamese South. These are all patriotic, 
freedom-loving individuals who have their

08:11.149 --> 08:23.065
stomach full of this despotic leader, and they 
just want to eliminate that. It's a civil war. Now,

08:25.969 --> 08:28.513
how can you go in there and stabilize a civil war? 
But the VC's been supported by the North

08:30.495 --> 08:36.103
Vietnamese, which in turn is supported by the USSR 
and also China. Well, How do you know that? We don't

08:39.502 --> 08:40.323
think so. Well, they have an agreement, like we 
have an agreement, to form support for a lot of

08:40.383 --> 08:47.089
countries, like Iran, for example. That doesn't 
necessarily mean we're supporting them in war. So

08:51.333 --> 09:04.306
as we talked about earlier,

08:51.333 --> 09:04.306
whether we were responsible or not, the leader 
they had was assassinated.

09:04.326 --> 09:07.729
Well, some said he was Catholic, and the Catholics 
were. were dominating

09:08.654 --> 09:15.120
the masses, see. And if you just eliminated him, 
then you'd have peace. Now, I have no at all

09:20.125 --> 09:23.728
information that we had anything to do with it. 
Certainly not the assassination. They're

09:25.690 --> 09:28.532
supposed to have been able to document that. But I 
think we did have something to do with his

09:28.552 --> 09:32.056
elimination overthrow. We didn't mean for him to 
be killed. But I'm not even sure about that because

09:33.897 --> 09:36.940
I wasn't connected with it. have no knowledge of. 
But anyway, that was probably the first mistake.

09:42.695 --> 09:44.356
Because it was downhill from then on. Because he 
did at least have some following. And if you could

09:48.801 --> 10:02.454
convince him to carry out the land reform that had 
been promised to him, and to be more tolerant from a

09:48.801 --> 10:02.454
religious standpoint, maybe it wouldn't have 
been so bad. Maybe it would have happened anyway.

10:06.569 --> 10:22.390
As far as you're concerned, who can, if the 
American public, we all seem to need a whipping

10:06.569 --> 10:22.390
boy, who would you blame as, or what part of society 
would you blame for the responsibility of losing

10:06.569 --> 10:22.390
that one? Who has the main burden to bear? Well, 
it's probably a combination of Congress

10:26.075 --> 10:36.188
and perhaps the President.

10:39.188 --> 10:47.377
I

10:39.188 --> 10:47.377
guess the military in some way that I'm trying to 
think.

10:50.661 --> 10:53.444
How, because our recommendation was never 
accepted. But the same people have said, because

10:54.926 --> 11:01.313
they, well, you expect that from the military, you 
know, they'll shoot down everything in sight. So

11:02.474 --> 11:06.799
there wasn't much attention ever given to the 
recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At

11:08.146 --> 11:13.431
one read, you find that Air Force general acting as 
chairman was so abrupt, he saw an opportunity

11:08.146 --> 11:13.431
here. He had the piece of paper, you know, he'd go to 
use his authority to get the bombing committed.

11:22.600 --> 11:32.009
But it all started with Kennedy, with the special 
forces he was so on, that we would never have to have

11:22.600 --> 11:32.009
a large, continued troop. They could go in there 
and help out, because they're going in And their

11:34.994 --> 11:38.399
tribesmen there, just like in Iran, speak a 
different language. They hate the central

11:38.419 --> 11:40.683
government. You need people to go in there and 
train them. They even have medical teams that can

11:43.066 --> 11:45.169
help them out. They tend to stabilize the country, 
see. And see if you can't get them to

11:48.274 --> 11:57.208
place their allegiance on the central 
government, see. Communism never entered into it

11:57.228 --> 11:59.491
at that time. These really were VCs that are 
unhappy.

12:04.981 --> 12:06.383
They were unhappy ever since. Going all the way 
back to the French. All the way back, really, to

12:10.147 --> 12:12.510
World War II. So do you see the war more as a 
nationalistic campaign than a communist one? No,

12:17.255 --> 12:20.780
it developed into this, and we played the game. By 
we, I mean this nation.

12:26.206 --> 12:31.712
Later on, then, of course, when Paul D. Harkin, the 
one I mentioned, is retired in Dallas now. He was a

12:31.732 --> 12:34.836
commanding general there after the Green Parade. 
And he pointed out that with the present status quo

12:36.571 --> 12:48.084
there, we're not getting anywhere because what we 
wanted is a stable government with a unified

12:36.571 --> 12:48.084
country. South now, we're not North, we're 
leaving that out. South Vietnam, unified, land

12:50.807 --> 12:57.435
reform, stable government. And that shouldn't be 
too hard to attain because then the VCs wasn't as

12:57.455 --> 13:02.901
strong as they later became. But as we put in, Then 
the North Vietnamese became more active, and the

13:07.452 --> 13:15.684
USSR supported them more so with equipment. Now, 
we played their game. We put in, they put in. And it

13:20.692 --> 13:21.894
kept adding it up. Pretty soon, we had 
hostilities. And the South was secure, at least

13:24.197 --> 13:29.806
stable.

13:29.826 --> 13:33.291
Later on, we put troops down in the South. fought 
like hell down there see because then the BC came on

13:33.659 --> 13:40.967
down to Laos and Cambodia and there they were in 
there. North Vietnamese even. Now at one time we

13:44.291 --> 13:50.538
had the strength that we could have knocked North 
Vietnam out of the war. We could have bombed the

13:52.980 --> 13:57.586
harbor with precision bombing which we later did. 
It's true that we kind of scraped off the paint on a

13:57.966 --> 14:01.590
few Russian ships but Nothing really came on it 
except, of course, they loudly protested. We had

14:07.028 --> 14:13.495
the capability to completely destroy their 
war-making capability. And we could have landed

14:13.515 --> 14:19.320
anywhere along that and actually occupied with 
Marines. Occupied.

14:22.603 --> 14:28.609
Not all, you wouldn't have to, but you could either 
go inland or you could make amphibious operations

14:22.603 --> 14:28.609
because they didn't have the power. But that is the 
way we played the game, see. a little bit more and a

14:31.675 --> 14:33.418
little bit more. In other words, we almost told 
them, we won't use our power until you have a better

14:33.438 --> 14:40.589
chance of countering it. Of course, that wasn't 
the thinking at all, but that's the way it turned

14:40.710 --> 14:43.634
out. We didn't attack the North until they got 
rockets and improved their air defenses where

14:45.077 --> 14:54.412
they could shoot our planes out of the air, 
including B-52s. We didn't use B-52s until they

14:54.652 --> 14:58.138
had a capability to shoot them out of the air. They 
didn't have that capability at the beginning when

14:59.030 --> 15:05.117
we started having caveats down in the south. 
Neither could the USR support them, because they

15:05.157 --> 15:08.862
had to bring things in from the USSR by ship. China, 
really, as we found out now, as much as we know about

15:10.283 --> 15:16.030
them, they didn't have very much they could 
support them. But they really didn't have a lot to

15:16.270 --> 15:19.935
give them. But we didn't do that. Now we're 
dragging on. We have all these caveats. And our

15:26.022 --> 15:27.223
nation turned against them. They were tired. And 
one thing that made them tired is looking at that

15:28.882 --> 15:35.611
dribble every single night on television. Then, 
of course, they sought out their job to do that. The

15:38.795 --> 15:44.443
most dastardly scenes and crimes that you could 
imagine. So you put a large responsibility on the

15:44.483 --> 15:47.226
media? Well, yes, but that's unfair. Yes, I do. 
Because I have heard An individual. I don't know

15:58.379 --> 15:59.801
his name. It says that he was directed to submit 
copy based on a party line or position they had. If

16:09.276 --> 16:20.715
he sent in copy and pictures that deviated from 
that, they would rewrite it and use the library of

16:09.276 --> 16:20.715
pictures to support that position. That happened 
in Iran after most of that. I was on a ship going to

16:24.637 --> 16:31.748
London, airplane, going to London to a meeting. 
Syngnam had that Persian Gulf area

16:32.049 --> 16:35.213
responsibility then. After that, there was 
really a planning meeting for Iran. And this plane

16:39.841 --> 16:44.989
was full of correspondents that had been in there 
covering the Iranians. And I guess it was Life

16:45.009 --> 16:48.134
magazine. Either Life or Time, I've already 
forgotten. had just come out with a cover story and

16:51.586 --> 16:55.831
all those things. And these others were razzing 
this guy about his copy. They said, you know that

17:02.180 --> 17:04.062
didn't happen like that. Where'd you get all that 
stuff? He says, well, that's not what I submitted.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.792
That was rewritten. And he said, you see that 
picture there? I didn't take that picture of the

17:14.055 --> 17:15.857
photographer. That's a picture that was taken in 
North Africa. If you look closely, you can see that

17:19.210 --> 17:22.133
that's not an Iranian standing there. That's an 
Arab. And that's a different tank. And do you have

17:26.538 --> 17:31.724
proof that the media was doing things like this in 
Vietnam? Or are these just things that you heard?

17:34.988 --> 17:42.216
Well, I don't personally have proof, but there are 
others that have proof of that because they talked

17:34.988 --> 17:42.216
to somebody that day. Most of it was hack truth, not 
fabrication. You can take a picture and write any

17:45.920 --> 17:48.643
kind of story you want to. But it wasn't favorable, 
I'll put it that way. Then later on, I know this to be

17:52.010 --> 17:53.913
a fact. In many of the newsrooms and places, they 
had LBJ's pictures and they used it as a dart. They

18:00.524 --> 18:03.909
wouldn't anymore write anything favorable about 
LBJ because they hated him. One reason they hated

18:03.989 --> 18:05.091
him, you know why? He insisted on going out here to 
the ranch and living, see. And the press, we didn't

18:11.422 --> 18:14.466
even have the nice hotels we have here now. They had 
to stay at the Stephen F. Austin and a bunch of these

18:14.506 --> 18:22.337
ratty-looking hotels and had to commute back and 
forth. And it was very uncomfortable. And they

18:24.800 --> 18:27.183
blamed him for making life miserable for them. And 
they wouldn't anymore give him good coffee. Now,

18:29.847 --> 18:37.537
him and the person wouldn't make any difference, 
but he attacked the war and everything to get at him

18:29.847 --> 18:37.537
or him because of the war. So the whole thing just 
got this country So sick, including even the

18:41.257 --> 18:47.527
military, going on and on and on like that. You see 
how Congress changed. They voted two votes

18:49.129 --> 18:56.881
against the Gulf of Tonkin residents, the guy from 
Alaska and old Morris, I guess. I guess he's from

18:56.901 --> 18:58.083
Dakota, isn't he? They were the two who voted 
against him, Fulbright and Leslie. And they

19:02.530 --> 19:06.196
practically gave the president anything he 
wanted to. It was an undeclared, declared war. And

19:09.877 --> 19:13.102
so he started up. But in summary, it looks like the 
whole thing, in your opinion, is a mess. Terrible.

19:21.393 --> 19:22.214
Well, let's go ahead. Just like the desert 
operation. That's terrible. Terrible. Made the

19:26.721 --> 19:29.004
military look like acid. Wore out our equipment. 
All of these caves. Billions of dollars. Just

19:34.532 --> 19:36.354
think how much we made. One of the reasons for 
inflation is because What do we do? We just printed

19:40.089 --> 19:41.651
more money, see? Didn't raise taxes. We didn't 
call up the reserves, because they didn't want to,

19:44.095 --> 19:49.883
supposed to upset the reason, of course. Good 
reason we didn't declare war, because that had a

19:49.983 --> 19:54.189
lot of trade implications worldwide. Had all 
these games, but for what?

20:02.482 --> 20:04.224
Sounds like you're demoralized. We expanded, 
instead of calling up the reserves, We expanded

20:07.353 --> 20:10.978
Austin Candidate School in the draft. So what we 
brought in, 18 and 19-year-old, 20 years old, we

20:10.998 --> 20:27.722
actually, short of noncommissioned Austin, so we 
identified these young men in basic training that

20:10.998 --> 20:27.722
indicated at that short time an aptitude for 
leadership. And of course, you go by, interview

20:28.563 --> 20:34.591
some, you know, what you asked for, you're a 
leader, you know, what did you do? He probably was

20:34.611 --> 20:37.275
captain of this football team, leading the debate 
something. Anyway, he indicated something. So

20:41.829 --> 20:49.520
right then, we put a thing around his arm and he 
becomes what amounts to as a corporal. He's a squad

20:50.221 --> 20:51.502
leader. He's a contemporary of these guys. They 
came in together. So we keep on and hopefully he is

20:56.930 --> 21:04.000
having to learn leadership at the same time basic 
training. And we go on where he becomes a leader.

21:06.955 --> 21:11.121
He's identified as a potential non-commissioned 
officer. Then he's just in his training unit, you

21:11.141 --> 21:14.125
know. So with that, we gave him some additional 
training. Oftentimes, he gets to Vietnam before

21:18.271 --> 21:23.458
these other kids that he came in to serve. That's 
the young man who's a non-comm for this other

21:23.958 --> 21:29.646
private, although I'm not the same age. He's 
expecting, you know. that he's expecting he does.

21:33.939 --> 21:34.860
He's fighting a war. This guy here responds with 
his squad. And then he finally, if he survives, he

21:36.722 --> 21:39.526
gets to be a platoon sergeant. OCS the same way. 
They're young. They end up by having an OCS

21:45.214 --> 21:57.111
graduate just out of school with his non-comm 
that's just out of basic training, advanced

21:45.214 --> 21:57.111
individual training, not just basic training. 
Then above him, you've got a captain. Who is this

21:59.234 --> 22:00.115
captain? He graduated mostly about two or three 
months ago,

22:00.972 --> 22:09.280
maybe longer now that he's a captain. But 
oftentimes the characters were so high, I won't

22:09.300 --> 22:17.027
exaggerate, make him a company commander as a 
first lieutenant. And then that applied in just a

22:17.247 --> 22:21.671
short time. Now our policy of rotating officers, 
we tried to leave them in there not much over a year.

22:31.077 --> 22:33.559
This pipeline keeps coming in from the state. Now 
we're rotating the officers, so when they get a

22:33.619 --> 22:40.085
year's experience, they're gone, and somebody 
new comes in. So you've got inexperience leading

22:41.306 --> 22:48.973
to inexperience, and it just keeps going like 
that. It's just terrible. That's the reason I say,

22:50.695 --> 22:59.903
if you sat down with what I know now, the school and 
the experience, and tried to figure out where in

22:50.695 --> 22:59.903
the world would you select not to fight a war, after 
having select this gosh awful place, how can I

23:00.507 --> 23:16.930
structure my personnel management procedure and 
principle to add to that terrible place? Well, I

23:16.950 --> 23:18.853
would come up with what I just described. Now, how 
would you handicap these people in this terrible

23:20.055 --> 23:26.464
place, restrict the bombing and air support to 
just in front of them. But this is a guerrilla-type

23:29.711 --> 23:32.475
war. You can't see the VC. Well, we'll use the 
foliage. We'll just clear out all of the

23:37.141 --> 23:39.604
underbrush, you know. All of that time and energy, 
and now it turns out it's probably a terrible

23:40.445 --> 23:44.952
thing. They say, well, that's great that we got 
that. Well, what about North Vietnam? Well, don't

23:49.718 --> 23:54.004
touch them, because it's our policy that they're 
not in South Vietnam. It's our policy. It's not in

23:55.889 --> 23:56.891
Cambodia. It's our policy. It's not in Laos. But we 
see them there. You don't understand. Now, are you

24:01.697 --> 24:06.463
giving these kids really a fair shake? Now, I add to 
this. These are the kids that are not going to

24:10.808 --> 24:13.532
college. Many of them are black, more than their 
proportion in our population. And is this fair?

24:24.605 --> 24:31.775
And that's the reason why I don't have any patience 
with all these who missed all of this, because they

24:24.605 --> 24:31.775
should suffer like these guys. So you feel that our 
soldiers in the field were treated unfairly from a

24:31.795 --> 24:36.561
number of viewpoints.

24:40.226 --> 24:42.909
They just weren't given the support. That's 
right. Now you've got them in there. Now they're

24:45.673 --> 24:46.654
rotating. They see all of them die. It looks like 
that they may... I had the same feeling in Italy. I

24:50.439 --> 24:52.662
don't know how many people we lost here going... 
Three miles, look how many miles I got to go ahead of

24:53.131 --> 24:56.375
all these mountains. Nobody could possibly 
survive that thing. Here they are. They're

25:00.180 --> 25:04.846
hopeful that they can survive for their year where 
they can go back. It wasn't like that. Even in

25:09.732 --> 25:14.177
Korea, we had

25:09.732 --> 25:14.177
success.

25:16.820 --> 25:18.683
Vietnam, you know, it's searching. Search and 
destroy. Search and destroy, and you go out and you

25:20.765 --> 25:22.868
come back. Muddy, raining.

25:30.882 --> 25:36.068
But I think if we go in and support and say, okay, we 
didn't declare the war in Korea. This is not a war,

25:37.129 --> 25:40.113
but we're going to fight it like a war. And if we get 
somebody exposed to death, then we owe it to him.

25:44.678 --> 25:47.921
We're going to give him full support. And we're 
here. The best way we can stabilize a country is

25:50.044 --> 25:53.648
clear it out. and not fool around with a pocket of 
B.C. here and there and send out. We finally got so

25:59.878 --> 26:09.870
scattered that we had to use most of our troops to 
secure our bases.

26:09.890 --> 26:11.112
There's no way to fight a war. What you have to do is 
clear it out the way that you don't have to

26:11.452 --> 26:17.020
do it. Let's go on to your last assignment at Fort 
Monroe, Virginia. Were you happy to leave the

26:23.952 --> 26:28.259
Pentagon after three years of pressure? Well, 
yeah. Anybody, see, because I lived in, as we

26:31.724 --> 26:47.168
talked about, in Fairfax, Virginia, and had to 
commute heavy traffic, which took quite a

26:31.724 --> 26:47.168
considerable time, because what I did, usually, 
go to work real early, and then come back after the

26:31.724 --> 26:47.168
rush. Most of the people, most of the rush was on the 
bureaucratic time table. But I was ready to move on

26:53.230 --> 26:59.299
to something else because that's long enough. And 
I was delighted to go to Fort Monroe because Fort

26:59.319 --> 27:07.872
Monroe is a beautiful old post, one of the oldest 
posts in the United States. In fact, when they

27:07.892 --> 27:15.383
settled Jamestown, they dropped off a contingent 
there on the, not Fort Monroe then, but on this

27:07.892 --> 27:15.383
point. They had to guide the ships up the channel 
toward Jamestown. And at Fort Monroe, you were

27:20.821 --> 27:26.388
assistant deputy chief of staff for individual 
training. Yeah, we were responsible. What does

27:27.269 --> 27:27.910
that mean? We were responsible for all the 
training centers in the United States. And all of

27:34.918 --> 27:36.841
the schools in the United States. That's a 
tremendous responsibility. And we had the

27:42.908 --> 27:50.237
responsibility for each week bringing in 
draftees. we'd have to decide which training

27:51.466 --> 27:57.211
center they would be sent. And sometimes we'd have 
to reschedule them because we had a...

28:08.041 --> 28:15.068
In the United States, the draft, well, as you'd 
expect, it was not the same. We'd get a heavy load

28:15.108 --> 28:18.891
for one part of the country and a weak load in 
another. And we had to decide, based on capacity,

28:20.103 --> 28:23.926
which of those may be shipped. That's the first 
problem. And then the second problem, after

28:26.048 --> 28:32.053
they've been through basic training, where we 
send them for advanced individual training. In

28:32.073 --> 28:34.455
the Vietnam War, we were using all our facilities. 
I'm dumb. No, that's why I was quite a junk. And then

28:38.859 --> 28:42.922
after they graduate, of course, the Pentagon 
assigned them to the unit. But we were responsible

28:42.942 --> 28:50.008
for providing transportation from the training 
center to whatever destination that they're

28:42.942 --> 28:50.008
going. Now, we were responsible on the staff 
level, of course, the people like down in the base

28:50.512 --> 29:00.071
camp were the ones who actually rounded up the 
transportation. Then the school, we were

29:00.091 --> 29:12.655
responsible for the administration of the 
school, the curriculum, standards were

29:00.091 --> 29:12.655
maintained.

29:16.246 --> 29:18.569
And all the schools have quite a few. How many 
service schools were there in the Army at that

29:18.589 --> 29:23.515
time? Do you have any? I got a black one. So there's 
about 20 different Army service schools here.

29:34.928 --> 29:38.092
Okay, so the big problem was the budget. You had to 
fight for how much money was going to be budgeted

29:38.112 --> 29:42.197
for each school. Everywhere, right. And there are 
loads. Of course, during the Vietnam War, all of

29:46.030 --> 29:55.424
them had a tremendous load, but I didn't 
necessarily have the sufficient funds to support

29:46.030 --> 29:55.424
it.

29:59.791 --> 30:03.356
And I enjoyed that because I did a lot of traveling 
there. I would imagine going from school to

30:03.877 --> 30:07.602
school, checking out the training units. 
Especially the training centers, because the

30:07.622 --> 30:13.371
training centers, being full and having these 
young men and having problems with heat

30:14.870 --> 30:23.441
exhaustion and drill sergeants. And we were 
responsible that the standard was maintained at

30:23.461 --> 30:31.431
all training centers and not have one. And you 
could tell. You get the end product, and sometimes

30:32.512 --> 30:38.259
they could tell which training center they were 
from. And we tried to correct that, at least to get

30:40.702 --> 30:42.885
them all up to the standard of our best one. And that 
had a lot to do, of course, with the commanding

30:46.608 --> 30:57.399
general, the way that he conducted the training, 
and how closely he supervised the training. Did

30:57.419 --> 30:59.481
training change because of Vietnam? Was there a 
lot more influence on guerrilla warfare? There

31:02.944 --> 31:05.206
was. Each training center, we even built villages 
like that in Vietnam. of all the different types of

31:11.401 --> 31:31.563
weapons that they used, techniques they used, so 
that when he got there, he had some kind of idea of

31:11.401 --> 31:31.563
what to expect rather than having to learn the 
first week or two. And during this period, of

31:31.583 --> 31:37.510
course, there was a tremendous increase in the 
number of blacks and the number of women. into the

31:37.895 --> 31:39.777
armed forces. And there must have been an increase 
of those into the service schools. Not women. Not

31:46.985 --> 31:47.485
women. Well, we increased the WACs, but is that 
what you mean? Yeah. But not integrated into the

31:52.010 --> 31:55.654
unit. They served as WACs, as medical 
specialists, as typeists, communication, that

31:55.674 --> 32:04.904
sort of thing. But nothing like we have now. Right. 
And did you have any, during this time, of course,

32:08.168 --> 32:18.624
this is the rise of black power, and there were a 
number of black riots in the United States from 65

32:08.168 --> 32:18.624
to 68 or so. Did this have any impact on your 
training centers? Did you have any racial

32:22.170 --> 32:23.532
incidents? Oh, isolated ones, because you had 
those before there, but there was no evidence of

32:24.894 --> 32:35.931
any distrust or between the races are really 
antagonistic. In fact, they got real close in

32:40.661 --> 32:46.949
Vietnam, because all these deaf mixed partners of 
a lot of strange people, you know. Boy, sure. Got to

32:49.412 --> 32:50.934
be close buddies. Also, during this time, there 
was a switch in administrations from the Johnson

32:50.954 --> 32:59.405
Democratic administration to the Nixon 
Republicans. And I was wondering if that change

32:59.505 --> 33:03.690
had any impact on the way that you ran any of these 
schools?

33:12.219 --> 33:25.334
Because he did have a different approach toward 
Vietnam, somewhat different, that is,

33:12.219 --> 33:25.334
escalation in the bombing and the invasion into 
Cambodia, Mr. Nixon. So that basically knows the

33:25.554 --> 33:28.678
facts. Not really. Now, you take our aviation 
school. And I even had difficulty getting some of

33:33.725 --> 33:37.731
our military planners to understand this. That's 
a school where you have a long lead time. And you

33:42.559 --> 33:45.944
can't cut that old spigot off like you can a lot of 
places. You already have these in the pipeline. So

33:50.250 --> 33:59.605
as it started winding down the war, of course, 
schools like the aviation school had to reduce the

33:50.250 --> 33:59.605
load. And we closed. which was one big problem. 
Mineral wells, you know, that was our helicopter

34:03.541 --> 34:08.126
school, our base school. Real fine with the 
weather. People around there were great because

34:10.908 --> 34:16.574
they would permit you to use their ranch land with 
no rental at all. Go in and out and use it. So we

34:20.157 --> 34:21.438
closed that down. Did get permission. You're able 
to do things in Texas a little bit more. Of course,

34:27.084 --> 34:30.647
that wasn't such a source

34:32.382 --> 34:37.708
of income for the community. Of course, it was 
immediate mineral wells, but as you find, like

34:38.348 --> 35:01.393
Fort Dix up in New Jersey, we've been trying to 
close Fort Dix for years,

34:38.348 --> 35:01.393
and we probably never will, because most of our 
facilities are down in the south, and they say,

34:38.348 --> 35:01.393
here, you're closing out all of the facilities in 
the northeast part of the United States, and

35:01.694 --> 35:15.594
putting them down in Georgia, Carolina, Texas, 
Louisiana.

35:15.614 --> 35:16.875
What about the Air Cavalry? This is, of course, new 
in the Army. Yeah. And did that have any impact on

35:21.261 --> 35:23.585
your training? Yeah. They, too, that aviation 
necessary to and additional courses down at our

35:31.664 --> 35:39.354
aviation school, which is down in Alabama.

35:45.343 --> 35:46.484
But that's not too difficult. Of course, you need 
funds each time in your budget. But

35:49.228 --> 35:59.562
it's not too difficult to expand courses if you 
have an active school and those trained

36:00.115 --> 36:01.816
instructor that experienced it.

36:04.999 --> 36:09.883
But we ended up, of course, at the end of the Vietnam 
War, with more aviators than we needed,

36:04.999 --> 36:09.883
obviously. And that becomes a morale problem 
because we phased out some of the warrant officers

36:11.345 --> 36:21.814
who were aviated to make room for commissioned 
officers. And I was wondering why they decided to

36:21.834 --> 36:29.380
take high school graduates and then train them to 
fly helicopters and make them warrant officers in

36:29.512 --> 36:38.369
the first place instead of using commissioned 
officers. Why was that? The only thing I know is

36:41.755 --> 36:52.836
that when I was involved with this thing, the need 
for aviators was so great, and you could train a

36:41.755 --> 36:52.836
warrant officer, CS Limited, responsibility. 
You could actually say all you're going to do is fly

36:54.836 --> 37:04.508
a plane and at least have military knowledge and 
other things so that you can adjust the

36:54.836 --> 37:04.508
environment. But an officer is supposed to have a 
broader knowledge. It takes more time. Now, a good

37:11.477 --> 37:19.287
question, another good question would be, why 
don't you have sergeants flying helicopters?

37:19.307 --> 37:22.131
Because some countries have sergeants flying 
helicopters. Why do you have to be a warrant

37:22.735 --> 37:28.267
officer? I can't answer that, except no one seems 
to be receptive to that idea at all.

37:37.267 --> 37:39.231
One thing goes, a warrant officer gets more pay. 
You get a senior warrant officer, he makes more

37:39.272 --> 37:41.757
than a captain. So for the pay scale, that's 
probably... But did you take a lot of people who

37:45.077 --> 37:56.510
were in sergeant position at the time and offer 
them a warrant officer position if they went to a

37:45.077 --> 37:56.510
helicopter? Yeah, and some did that. Of course, 
you had to have some additional schooling because

37:58.312 --> 38:02.577
a warrant officer has to know more than just fly the 
plane. Sure. But yeah, they did that. We had a

38:06.181 --> 38:08.845
warrant officer program. You could either... 
planned to become a warrant officer through the

38:13.073 --> 38:22.642
system, or for those sergeants who were 
qualified, mentally and physically, could apply

38:13.073 --> 38:22.642
for it and then become a warrant officer. Why did 
you decide to retire? Well, I didn't have any other

38:27.827 --> 38:29.188
choice. I didn't get promoted. And one of the 
reasons I didn't is because of a fact I had on my

38:33.912 --> 38:42.000
record showed physical limitations. And so I 
retired at 30% disability. I didn't want to

38:48.835 --> 38:49.776
retire. Gosh, I'd still be there at age 65 if it 
weren't for being retired. But I'm very happy in

38:55.921 --> 38:57.863
retirement. I've done all of the things that I 
wanted to do.

39:03.168 --> 39:04.790
But you didn't have firm plans. I think we were 
talking about this earlier, but you didn't have

39:05.210 --> 39:12.797
firm plans like you wanted to go to work for a 
corporation or something like that. I was just

39:13.621 --> 39:21.030
looking for something that I could contribute 
something to. I talked to Nat Allen about Allen

39:21.050 --> 39:23.353
Academy. I was willing to go there, work there for 
him for free if I could just do something. But Nat

39:29.241 --> 39:33.106
told me that, of course, he doesn't have anything 
to do with it. He may still work there. I don't know

39:34.768 --> 39:36.910
who owns Allen Academy now. But he said, I know 
there will be problems I think he really thought

39:43.591 --> 39:48.015
that I meant to pay me something. If they were 
having a financial problem, they'd still be

39:48.035 --> 39:51.599
happy. But I had already told you about going out to 
A&M. Once again, then I was willing to do anything.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.930
I might contribute something. And I think that 
young man thought guys like me were a threat to

40:05.333 --> 40:10.278
them. Did their promotions a job? He hasn't bought 
it. I'm sure you've had your career. What do you

40:15.499 --> 40:16.801
mean, coming out here? So I wasn't disappointed, 
except I would like to build around that. Now, you

40:24.152 --> 40:33.326
had a special review when you did retire from Port 
Monroe, Virginia. Can you tell me a little about

40:33.366 --> 40:35.369
that? It's just about over. They asked me for songs 
there. What's Our Favorite, Stevie Gaines, those

40:41.354 --> 40:44.638
things.

40:47.743 --> 40:50.066
Then I had the Warrant and Standing Service Medal. 
It was more or less a routine type of a General

40:50.086 --> 40:55.433
Lawson title. Were you sad to leave the service? 
Oh, yeah. Did you feel bitter toward the service?

41:01.261 --> 41:05.046
Oh, no.

41:05.066 --> 41:05.767
I love the service. It's been very good to me. I 
don't see how anybody could be better. Well, I can

41:11.362 --> 41:12.183
see why. Maybe someone like a Vietnam veteran 
would, because he suffered so much, and he'd get

41:12.243 --> 41:18.270
kicked out. Nobody cared. Mainly his community, 
that's what's sad. See, we all came back in World

41:23.937 --> 41:37.213
War II, and the lowliest guy, he may not have even 
been in combat, but he was a hero, because he went

41:23.937 --> 41:37.213
and served his nation and made the sacrifice.

41:37.852 --> 41:45.222
Even in Korea when they came back, it was a little 
bit better because, see, we did call some reserves

41:37.852 --> 41:45.222
for Korea, the National Guard. That gets the 
Communion involved. This way we didn't. We just

41:48.506 --> 41:50.829
plucked these young men out, see. Somebody say, 
whatever happened to old So-and-so? I don't know.

41:54.314 --> 41:56.217
I think he went off to Vietnam.

42:01.884 --> 42:06.070
The lesson from all of this is we should never 
undertake a war or fighting that could become a war

42:07.568 --> 42:18.060
that you're not going to support, knowing that 
eventually the nation will tire, and when the

42:07.568 --> 42:18.060
nation tires, they don't support. It isn't fair to 
have these people. That's the thinking that

42:20.323 --> 42:22.565
should be at the beginning. And I thought we 
learned from Korea, see. But see, you have

42:25.629 --> 42:31.315
different people, different characters. In 
short, I can Here, just a short time ago, you could

42:36.172 --> 42:49.950
see the feeling in Congress and elsewhere that our 
military establishment is too large and we don't

42:36.172 --> 42:49.950
need all these weapons and so forth. And in a short 
time, it's changed where it's recognized that

42:49.970 --> 43:05.149
there is a gap between the improvement of the 
USSR's capability and ours, where ours kind of

42:49.970 --> 43:05.149
goes like this and theirs continues to go up. Ours 
goes down because we have less ships now. The B-52s

43:09.449 --> 43:10.651
are older. Metal fatigue is already occurring. 
Gosh, they're over 25 years old.

43:18.965 --> 43:20.568
And they look critical. Nearly all of the nations 
have conscripts in the one form or another. I was

43:27.400 --> 43:31.407
wondering as far, we've talked a little bit about 
advancement. And you said that you were lucky many

43:31.792 --> 43:41.254
times in your military service, not only 
considering advancement, but considering just

43:31.792 --> 43:41.254
being alive. And I was wondering about 
advancement. Did you feel that... advancement in

43:49.949 --> 43:58.340
a bureaucracy was because of luck or fate, or was it 
because of the things that you personally did? Was

43:58.781 --> 44:02.025
it because of your own accomplishments that were 
recognized?

44:06.792 --> 44:09.235
Well, that's difficult to answer because of all 
these answers. Of course, it's all three of those.

44:13.621 --> 44:18.227
But for an individual to accomplish something, 
he's got to have a lot of help. Yeah. I'm talking

44:20.189 --> 44:21.391
about a unit. Now, I looked good in the 18th 
Infantry because I had some real fine people that

44:21.411 --> 44:28.503
supported me. I didn't do it myself.

44:33.612 --> 44:41.385
Just a lot of pieces came together to make the 
totality, I think, a really outstanding unit.

44:41.405 --> 44:44.610
That was recognized by the support superiors and 
gave me credit, which of course it should because I

44:44.793 --> 44:52.181
should be the one that gets kicked in the veil and 
relieved if it's done right. So I was fortunate to

44:52.201 --> 44:55.485
have a unit that responded. I think I did 
contribute a little bit to developing and molding

44:55.585 --> 45:06.057
that unit into a really a fine organization. But I 
would have had an entirely different problem if I

45:06.077 --> 45:10.902
hadn't those fine young men that I say we've gotten 
trained. If we had inherited a bunch of

45:11.422 --> 45:14.927
troublemakers, you've got problems. Now, that's 
really a challenge for a leader. Now, some people

45:18.912 --> 45:32.229
are strong enough, right now I can't think of any, 
that can do it all by themselves just because God

45:18.912 --> 45:32.229
gave them all the qualities of leadership and they 
were able to do that. But that isn't the way it

45:32.249 --> 45:33.210
happens. You see some people like Patton who's 
wealthy. Well, if you're wealthy, you can really

45:35.253 --> 45:40.560
be secure and you can be an individual, see? 
Uh-huh. I don't mean he would have been different

45:41.560 --> 45:47.028
if he'd been, wouldn't have been different if he'd 
been poor. But certainly he didn't have to worry

45:47.068 --> 45:52.756
about that, for example.

45:52.776 --> 46:04.693
But if you had to make a pronouncement that which 
one is more important, the luck that you've

45:52.776 --> 46:04.693
mentioned many times or your own behavior, which 
one would you have to say overall in your birth? Oh,

46:04.713 --> 46:05.094
great. You mean if I had to select one and not two? I 
know it's impossible. Yeah, I wouldn't do that. I

46:12.661 --> 46:24.415
will say this, though, that I'm convinced, with no 
doubt in my mind, that

46:12.661 --> 46:24.415
leaders can be trained.

46:26.918 --> 46:28.219
I don't believe they're born. We say he's a born 
leader, and you find some that may be. But if you're

46:33.425 --> 46:41.875
not a born leader, and I certainly wasn't, you can 
take an individual who has a physical ability who

46:43.272 --> 46:55.509
has moral standards, who's willing to subjugate 
self for the good of the nation of the team right

46:43.272 --> 46:55.509
there, who's willing to suffer to do that. And he 
can learn techniques or how to handle different

46:55.529 --> 47:00.596
situations. And he is going to look good because 
he'll have a happy commitment.
