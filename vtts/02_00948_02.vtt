00:01.668 --> 00:14.259
At NETCOG, N-C-T-C-O-G, in addition to what we've 
just mentioned, I was instrumental in starting

00:01.668 --> 00:14.259
the water planning, and the way it worked out was 
that the initial staff that was there, the nucleus

00:01.668 --> 00:14.259
of three years. What program, what federal agency 
was that? Well, at that time it was the predecessor

00:17.421 --> 00:24.687
of EPA, Water Resources Council or something like 
that. They hadn't established EPA yet, and it was a

00:24.707 --> 00:31.253
federated program and dealt with with the 
regional planning of wastewater and water

00:31.587 --> 00:37.193
supply, that kind of thing, but primarily 
wastewater. And so the Upper Trinity River study

00:37.514 --> 00:49.667
began with my being the staff coordinator for it 
before a water director was hired. And then when

00:50.168 --> 00:55.594
the program got going, a water director was hired, 
and the thing moved into his hands. The same thing

00:55.614 --> 00:57.977
happened with a number of other programs. For 
example, Dan Petty, who was the director director

01:01.270 --> 01:05.878
of administration for the office, helped to 
establish the police academy there. Then when a

01:05.898 --> 01:10.225
police academy director was hired, that was all 
given to him. And I started the first work on the A95

01:10.926 --> 01:16.014
review program when it was initiated. And then a 
director of regional services was appointed, and

01:16.435 --> 01:21.403
he took that over. In fact, I think that Dan was the 
guy that took it over, but I was in on the first part

01:21.964 --> 01:28.054
of it. A lot of it was, you might say, getting the 
ball rolling and never following through on very

01:28.591 --> 01:34.042
many things. And we also started the population 
estimating program that now is an annual event at

01:34.743 --> 01:42.459
Cogginby. It's a very important part. This is one 
of the things that Bill Pitstick was very

01:43.962 --> 01:48.050
interested in and thought was very important. I 
think he was very right in his estimation about

01:49.583 --> 01:59.695
that, and it's a very important and a really 
reasonably accurate estimation program being

01:49.583 --> 01:59.695
within 3% of the 1980 census for most cities in the 
area. Another thing that we did which stands alone

02:00.275 --> 02:16.654
in some respects, and this involves another one of 
the people you're going to interview, Mike

02:00.275 --> 02:16.654
Mahoney, is that sometime in somewhere between 73 
and 75, I believe, maybe 72, we decided that A lot of

02:17.073 --> 02:23.139
cities in our region needed a lot of planning help, 
and that they needed some models. And when I say we,

02:23.619 --> 02:28.123
this was a special committee under the A95 review 
system. I sort of grew up with planners and

02:28.143 --> 02:33.549
engineers and some city managers on there. And 
they said, we need to have some models for local

02:33.969 --> 02:40.075
development ordinances. And so we developed a 
committee, and our staff developed an outline of

02:46.182 --> 02:51.767
what we wanted, solicited proposals from 
consultants. And Mike Mahoney, who had been

02:51.787 --> 03:06.742
director of planning in Fort Worth, was now 
consulting, won the award and developed what was

02:51.787 --> 03:06.742
called the Model Land Development Code, number 
one, and number two, the Community Planning

02:51.787 --> 03:06.742
Manual series. And the first, I can provide you 
with a little description of that for your

03:07.342 --> 03:15.210
appendix, essentially what the development code 
was. was a combination of zoning ordinance and

03:15.393 --> 03:35.243
subdivision regulations, floodplain 
regulations, and what do you call it, trailer

03:15.393 --> 03:35.243
home, mobile home park kind of regulations, and 
special district, industrial parks, apartment

03:15.393 --> 03:35.243
buildings, and shopping center regulations, 
that kind of thing. Did this come about about the

03:35.263 --> 03:39.350
same time as the ALI model ended up in court? This 
preceded it. And incidentally, I was very

03:40.552 --> 03:44.117
surprised to see that I had been one of the first 
persons in all modesty, I say, is to be invited by

03:44.536 --> 03:53.786
Charlie Haar way back in the mid-'70s when they 
were starting work on this thing. No, it was the

03:53.806 --> 03:59.071
mid-'60s, mid-'60s, because it was a 10-year 
project which ended around 75, 76. And Charlie

04:00.393 --> 04:06.459
Haar was with the HHFA at that time in Washington. 
And he'd invited, I don't know, about 20 of us,

04:06.779 --> 04:11.384
planners, to come in. And because of my work in 
Tulsa and Broadly because of that reputation, I

04:14.658 --> 04:17.803
was invited to take part in that. And I still have 
those old files of the first drafts and the

04:18.243 --> 04:23.371
original meeting that was held on that thing. 
Anyways, this was separate. But the idea of a

04:25.113 --> 04:37.492
development code which combined and simply 
combined subdivision and zoning ordinances into

04:25.113 --> 04:37.492
one code was actually evident in this model and 
development code. And maybe we didn't call it

04:37.512 --> 04:39.995
quite that. Maybe it was model community 
development or something like that. I can give you

04:43.480 --> 04:45.442
this complete description of it. And Mike was the 
guy that did it. He can tell you more about it. Then

04:48.886 --> 05:11.631
the other thing that happened there at COG that I 
think I would take some pride in, because this is

04:48.886 --> 05:11.631
the one thing that's cited in all works about 
planning in Texas, is this COG series of 10 small

04:48.886 --> 05:11.631
manuals, each about 3 eighths to a half an inch 
thick. And they want to update that now. And

05:14.342 --> 05:16.744
hopefully, we can help them through the APA to do 
that. Anyways, the other activity that led, in a

05:17.424 --> 05:41.365
sense, to my leaving the COG was that in about 1975, 
we were invited by the Institute of Urban Studies

05:17.424 --> 05:41.365
at UT Arlington to express interest or to evaluate 
a training program that they had come upon by

05:17.424 --> 05:41.365
virtue of being involved in a multi-state Title I 
Higher Education Act kind of study of training for

05:41.564 --> 05:49.217
local government people and so forth in which they 
did something in some other state. It happens that

05:49.518 --> 05:53.745
St. John's University in St. Cloud, Minnesota was 
the one that had developed for the state planning

05:54.326 --> 06:02.340
office there a series of training packages for 
local officials. And they were small little

06:02.843 --> 06:10.854
workshops of three hours each, one on zoning, one 
on subdivision regulation, et cetera. They had

06:10.894 --> 06:12.196
developed about six of those. And they were 
providing them as a part of this bigger interstate

06:12.997 --> 06:27.737
study and said, what we'll do is we'll say, OK, you 
take these packages, you see if they're

06:12.997 --> 06:27.737
applicable in your state, and then you Try them 
out, and use them for training. And we'll do the

06:30.723 --> 06:31.444
same. We'll take what you've developed, and we'll 
try it out in our area. But what happened was, with

06:34.307 --> 06:40.453
some way or another, they were able to hire Doug 
Crear and P.D. Crear, Jr. And he came on the staff,

06:40.513 --> 06:53.626
and he took the zoning module that they had and 
adapted it to Texas zoning law and revised the

06:40.513 --> 06:53.626
slideshow and so forth. And then when they got that 
all done, they had about, let's say, three or four

06:53.646 --> 06:58.230
others that were really worthy They asked me, what 
do I think of it? I said, the only way I can tell you

07:01.157 --> 07:04.021
that is to try it out. And so we indeed tried it. And 
in 1975, in August, I believe, we had our first

07:06.365 --> 07:10.973
trial in Euless, Texas. And we invited several 
cities from around there to send people. And it was

07:14.338 --> 07:15.820
a Friday and a Saturday. We had four modules, three 
hours in the morning, three hours in the

07:15.900 --> 07:19.146
afternoon. And that led, on my part, to, in the next 
few years, to conducting about 12 of these two-day

07:24.772 --> 07:29.980
workshops all over north central Texas. And I 
became interested in doing that, and did that

07:30.821 --> 07:47.387
almost exclusively, and then made a transition 
from working at COG to working at UT Arlington in

07:30.821 --> 07:47.387
the Institute of Urban Studies. And there was an 
intermediate period there where I was actually

07:47.975 --> 07:58.030
under contract to the COG to continue to conduct 
some of those workshops for them on a more or less

07:47.975 --> 07:58.030
quarterly basis. And when I got to UT Arlington, 
because of that experience, we decided, or they

07:58.871 --> 08:17.779
decided, the dean and so forth decided to get into 
another federally-aided program that involved

07:58.871 --> 08:17.779
us with the Texas Municipal League and with the 
similar leagues in the four adjoining states. on a

08:18.198 --> 08:24.506
similar kind of program to try out providing the 
leads with the capacity to train their people.

08:24.967 --> 08:30.133
Well, we had a very successful project insofar as 
the quality of training and the reactions of the

08:24.967 --> 08:30.133
training. But it turned out that they really 
needed professional planners interested in

08:30.574 --> 08:39.705
training and delivering the thing to make it work. 
In other words, they needed something like the

08:39.725 --> 08:44.391
short course or a modified form of it, which is what 
these workshops were, a modified form. And that

08:49.391 --> 08:57.562
one thing led to another so that eventually we had 
some three federated programs that involved

08:49.391 --> 08:57.562
different groups. We finally even worked with the 
Texas Department of Community Affairs on

08:57.602 --> 09:13.264
preparing some extra planning so that the 
original six modules, which the Institute of

08:57.602 --> 09:13.264
Urban Studies obtained in 1975 as being a part of 
this project, now numbers some 30 modules. that I

09:13.582 --> 09:20.837
can also provide you with the short titles of all 
those, running almost the full range. And as an

09:21.478 --> 09:34.003
example, instead of running just four workshops a 
year, in the next month, I'll be running five or six

09:21.478 --> 09:34.003
workshops.

09:34.304 --> 09:37.268
parties to five or six workshops, because others 
are involved as well. We try to do it that way now.

09:38.990 --> 09:51.527
And these do not, incidentally, as was feared 
initially by some of the people on the educational

09:38.990 --> 09:51.527
foundation, these do not take the place of what 
they complement and supplement the short course.

09:52.328 --> 09:58.236
And indeed, the educational foundation is now 
looking toward trying to establish these more

09:58.975 --> 10:10.391
strongly with each of the COGs, if possible, or at 
least each of the APA sections in the state so that

09:58.975 --> 10:10.391
there will be educational foundation support for 
regionalized training. In a sense, a mini short

10:10.411 --> 10:28.257
course that can be regionalized and closely 
correlated with the annual short course that

10:10.411 --> 10:28.257
started in 1971, as we said, and will become part of 
an integrated program of training for local

10:10.411 --> 10:28.257
officials.

10:32.050 --> 10:48.544
At UT Arlington, the printing program in 
planning, called the City and Regional Planning

10:32.050 --> 10:48.544
Program, was initiated at the same time that the 
School of Architecture and Environmental Design

10:32.050 --> 10:48.544
was established. And the exact date of that, I 
can't be sure, but it was sometime around 1970, if I

10:49.165 --> 10:58.393
remember correctly. Or maybe it was mid-'70s. 
Anyway, that is a matter of record. We can dig that

11:03.276 --> 11:05.880
out to be sure about it. But Harold Box, who was a 
prominent architect, member of the firm of Pratt,

11:05.900 --> 11:25.570
Box, and Whitney in Dallas, was apparently 
invited by the university or some way to become the

11:05.900 --> 11:25.570
first dean, and he established the school. And he 
included in that architecture, landscape

11:29.358 --> 11:39.432
architecture, environmental design, and 
building construction, and urban and regional

11:29.358 --> 11:39.432
planning, about a five-pronged total program. 
And I guess maybe eventually interior design came

11:40.133 --> 11:45.541
in or something too in that whole thing. And the man 
that he hired as the first director was Joe B.

11:45.561 --> 11:55.855
Goldstein, AICP. who can probably add some to this 
about the early history of it. Anyways,

12:00.895 --> 12:05.860
initially, it was under the auspices of that 
Architectural and Environmental Design. And

12:05.920 --> 12:17.111
then about two years ago, moved over to the 
Institute of Urban Studies since it became very

12:05.920 --> 12:17.111
much more closely associated with local 
government concerns, which was part of the

12:05.920 --> 12:17.111
Institute's purview. And the, what shall I say, 
the program was the third in Texas, and was the

12:26.480 --> 12:31.167
third recognized program in Texas. And I don't 
recall right now, but I know that the North Central

12:31.687 --> 12:44.285
Texas section of the AIP volunteered to Hal Box to 
help design a curriculum. And the chairperson of

12:44.305 --> 12:47.790
that committee was Mike Mahoney. And I was a member 
of that. And I don't remember now who the other two

12:52.940 --> 12:54.101
or three members were. Maybe Bill Shevlin, I 
believe, was one of them, too. And I must say,

12:57.546 --> 13:03.873
however, that again, Mike Mahoney did the bulk of 
the work on that. And Bill Shevlin, because of his

13:04.494 --> 13:15.628
experience in teaching planning and having been 
on a planning faculty, I'm sure made more

13:04.494 --> 13:15.628
contributions than I did. My experience in 
teaching planning had gone back to being an

13:18.556 --> 13:28.266
adjunct and a visiting lecturer at some 20 
universities, in fact, starting with University

13:18.556 --> 13:28.266
of Arkansas when I first went to Tulsa. But 
anyways, the point was that Mike and I had become

13:28.786 --> 13:39.817
associated at Texas Christian University when he 
was on the adjunct faculty there, and he invited me

13:28.786 --> 13:39.817
to join them in about 68. And so some of my work of 
that type also supported my going into

13:40.217 --> 13:47.905
educational work as a third career, as it were. And 
the initial outline of the curriculum for the

13:48.442 --> 13:58.488
school was at least proposed by Professional 
Planning Society. It's February 23rd, and the

14:00.433 --> 14:03.902
next interview is with Mike Mahoney.
