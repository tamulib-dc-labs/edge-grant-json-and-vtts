WEBVTT

00:01.617 --> 00:16.435
We're talking about the fact that we're seeing 
high density in a traditional sense, high

00:01.617 --> 00:16.435
density, rather than the Houston notion of high 
density, 16 units to the acre. We're talking about

00:16.455 --> 00:18.198
high rise condominiums. We're seeing these 
things springing up in these activity centers

00:19.119 --> 00:29.852
that you would have normally, through a planning 
process, I would assume, put your residential

00:19.119 --> 00:29.852
areas uh around those activity centers to 
minimize the travel and we're seeing that take

00:30.305 --> 00:56.008
place right now in greenway plaza around the 
downtown area continuing

00:30.305 --> 00:56.008
demand for residential properties around the the 
downtown area and around the greenway plaza

00:30.305 --> 00:56.008
galleria area well those are three no more there's 
probably more It just depends on what you want. You

00:57.916 --> 01:04.827
can call it Greenspoint Mall, Sharpstown Mall, 
Gulfgate, Northwest Crossing. The big three

01:05.829 --> 01:11.819
basically are the Galleria, Greenway Plaza, and 
Downtown. Medical Center is a little different

01:12.700 --> 01:19.752
kind of operation, but it's a big one too.

01:21.976 --> 01:22.857
But I think that Whether the market forces, you 
know, the market doesn't give a goddamn what

01:24.068 --> 01:28.893
happens. The market merely is a reflection of what 
is. And they say it's a market approach, but

01:33.337 --> 01:51.055
whatever it is, there seems to be a clear, in my 
mind, a little bit of a turnaround toward

01:33.337 --> 01:51.055
continued expansion, you know, lot after lot 
after lot, because it's just too goddamn

01:33.337 --> 01:51.055
expensive. You know, you get the fuel costs, the 
heating and cooling costs. It's becoming a little

01:57.824 --> 02:07.314
bit prohibitive, especially for young people, to 
buy a single family house, number one. Number two,

02:07.615 --> 02:13.461
if they buy one, it's out 35 miles from the city, and 
they've got to pay to drive in and out of town.

02:16.224 --> 02:16.945
That's a problem. Of course, on the other hand, 
you've got some corporations moving out into the

02:16.965 --> 02:21.970
suburbs. So we've got both, you know, you don't 
know whether the people follow the jobs or the jobs

02:22.591 --> 02:28.058
follow the people. We've got both phenomena 
occurring right here. On balance, do you think,

02:33.105 --> 02:40.314
which direction is being favored currently? Is 
there a centripetal or a centripetal force? Well,

02:45.341 --> 02:49.486
you can look around downtown and see what we've got 
going in. Which is? A lot of very tall buildings, a

02:52.983 --> 02:58.588
lot of office space, like Texas Commerce Tower. 
How many stories? That was 75. We've got a 70-story

03:02.832 --> 03:13.821
building that hadn't gotten out of the hole yet and 
just finished a 65-story, which is the first

03:02.832 --> 03:13.821
international plaza. First city's built a couple 
of big buildings. I'm not sure how big they are. But

03:19.346 --> 03:22.669
that's the Gerald Hines building, the one we're 
talking about across the city hall, the Ken

03:23.003 --> 03:31.252
Schnitzer building, that's a Gerald Pines 
building. So you do have, you know, an

03:31.272 --> 03:42.744
intensification of downtown office space, and 
most of these places are new stuff now, even before

03:31.272 --> 03:42.744
the... But you do have, you've got movement out to 
the suburbs as well. Is it on, would you say... the

03:52.079 --> 03:54.002
equal of the in-city development?

03:56.906 --> 03:57.467
It probably is. It's not as dramatic because you 
don't see it. It doesn't go straight up. But I don't

04:02.574 --> 04:04.557
know what the balance is. I really don't. Maybe 
Roscoe, as planner, would know that. He probably

04:08.423 --> 04:09.264
does. That's a good question for Roscoe.

04:18.197 --> 04:21.462
Now, tell me about transportation. in Houston 
since you've been here.

04:27.043 --> 04:28.305
Where has it come from? What are its problems? And 
where withergoes Houston in terms of mass

04:31.308 --> 04:38.377
transportation? And I suppose that in mass 
transportation, we ought to include mass transit

04:39.258 --> 04:50.672
as well as the freeway system, if you want to call it 
a freeway system, which to me is a misnomer in the

04:39.258 --> 04:50.672
case of Houston. What do you mean? It ain't free. 
There ain't no way. It's virtually always

04:56.390 --> 05:02.880
bottlenecked and quite hazardous.

05:04.302 --> 05:14.357
I would say it's probably the poorest designed 
urban freeway system I have encountered in the

05:04.302 --> 05:14.357
United States.

05:14.377 --> 05:16.360
Personally, as a planner, I would say that. For you 
or Mayor McConnell. Yeah, I think that they...

05:22.040 --> 05:26.208
They didn't limit access enough on the dock is the 
main problem. On the gulf? Huh? On the gulf? No, on

05:28.632 --> 05:29.413
any of it. On any of it? On Southwest Freeway in 
particular inside the loop. It's ridiculous.

05:32.940 --> 05:34.482
You're getting on while somebody's getting off. 
Sometimes you can't. It is a mess. And the signing

05:39.712 --> 05:44.200
seems to assume that you are a resident and have 
been since birth. Yeah, yeah. I'll buy that

05:47.135 --> 05:48.196
sometimes. It's a little confusing. And you never 
know where to turn until the moment of truth, and

05:49.878 --> 05:53.722
then it's too late. It very well may be. I don't 
know. You've become used to it. Yeah, I've talked

06:00.751 --> 06:02.693
to the highway department. The highway boys, 
that's all they do. If you're a stranger in town,

06:04.735 --> 06:07.599
it's merciless. I think it's much better than 
Dallas. Much easier to me. That's no distraction.

06:15.888 --> 06:21.457
Yeah, well, I mean, we're always being compared to 
Dallas, which is like comparing San Francisco to

06:15.888 --> 06:21.457
Los Angeles. I mean, it's almost the same 
parallel. I wouldn't want to do that. No, I mean,

06:26.925 --> 06:34.137
but not comparing San Francisco to Dallas or L.A. 
to Houston, but the various mentalities. People

06:34.157 --> 06:41.929
do compare Houston to Los Angeles, and in all 
candor, when I hear this said, I recoil. This is not

06:42.888 --> 06:53.221
my interview, but I can't help but get into the 
actor a little bit, being from the West Coast and

06:42.888 --> 06:53.221
California, I know, as it were, to some degree. 
But, you know, there are parts of Los Angeles that

06:53.281 --> 06:57.866
are downright beautiful. Oh, yeah. There are 
parts of Houston that are downright beautiful.

07:01.511 --> 07:05.095
Well, you've got to look for them, and you've got to 
look very hard for them. Whereas in Los Angeles,

07:06.016 --> 07:08.119
they're apparent. and they are outrageously 
beautiful and attractive, and everything is done

07:08.791 --> 07:16.162
right from the planning point of view. Now, I don't 
believe that Houston has any rightful claim to be

07:16.182 --> 07:22.451
the Los Angeles of Texas. We don't mean to be. We 
mean to be the Houston of Texas. That's all. Okay,

07:27.479 --> 07:28.240
you said it. Yes, I did. Now, what does this mean? 
Nothing. We have, in Houston, we have, I think of it

07:30.723 --> 07:35.811
as, a very Texan mentality when it comes to 
governance. And the people of this city

07:45.503 --> 07:57.060
do not like intervention on the part of the 
government. And although you hear people

07:57.080 --> 08:08.076
bitching about the streets being bad and the 
garbage not being picked up and everything, there

07:57.080 --> 08:08.076
is a refusal on the part of the powers that be to want 
to pay for a higher quality of service. When push

08:21.143 --> 08:24.408
comes to shove, you can talk about efficiency and 
everything. But when you're underfunded 400%,

08:24.428 --> 08:30.357
you're not going to be able to do your job. And the 
cost of government goes up just like the cost of

08:30.377 --> 08:34.002
everything else. And I think that people are 
willing to pass bond issues And they're willing to

08:39.629 --> 08:44.054
pay, but they don't want to very much. And I think 
the city, since I've been here, I think we're

08:45.936 --> 08:52.304
getting more. Houston was considered a place 
where you worked and not where you lived. And I

08:57.170 --> 08:58.591
think we're getting a little turnaround. We're 
getting some people here to say, hey, you know,

08:58.611 --> 09:02.496
this is the shits. You know, let's clean it up. 
Let's do something about it. And there's some

09:05.059 --> 09:07.402
people that are really trying to do that. And 
there's some people that say, you know, Forget it.

09:12.526 --> 09:13.307
I'm not going to pay. It's a place where you make a 
fast buck, and there are some people like that. I

09:17.772 --> 09:24.720
don't think that that totally pervades the whole 
society like we are accused of in many places.

09:25.541 --> 09:28.584
Especially as the popular press currently. 
Popular press. I get real sick of that crap, okay,

09:30.607 --> 09:37.815
because... Texas business... Well, fine, but 
they're Dallas outfits. Okay. I would find

09:38.168 --> 09:47.021
working in Dallas extremely boring unless I was in 
the tax office and I would have probably been fired

09:38.168 --> 09:47.021
like their tax assessor was on their evaluation. 
To me, that's boring. They are, for all practical

09:48.503 --> 09:55.012
purposes, they could consider themselves just 
like an eastern city. They're surrounded by

09:55.032 --> 09:58.898
suburbs, suburban villages, towns. They can't 
annex them. We're not. And we won't allow that to

10:01.241 --> 10:05.087
happen. The downside of that is that In terms of 
federal funding, we didn't talk about it at lunch,

10:08.476 --> 10:17.229
but I'd like to get at it. We did manage to get the 
pockets of poverty provisions applied in the UDAG

10:17.550 --> 10:28.386
regulations. Because you're really dealing, if 
you deal with Houston, you're dealing with a

10:28.406 --> 10:34.095
region almost. And because the fact that we annex 
our suburbs and don't let them incorporate, nor

10:34.531 --> 10:53.394
are we going to start, by the way, we have an 
extremely high tax base, but we do have areas of the

10:34.531 --> 10:53.394
city that have been neglected for many, many years 
because of the fact that the continued growth

10:34.531 --> 10:53.394
drained the city coffers. And now, basically, the 
new annexations are enabling us to renovate and

11:03.742 --> 11:06.927
revitalized some of our inner city 
neighborhoods. And clearly they're paying the

11:06.947 --> 11:09.731
bill. So it's not the fault of the suburban areas. 
We're annexing these areas and they're saying,

11:12.234 --> 11:16.160
well, fine, you know, and we don't have any parks. 
But those guys out there are paying

11:16.240 --> 11:22.129
for the revitalization. So the mistakes that were 
made were in the past and not particularly right

11:22.169 --> 11:25.133
now. The last two administrations have had a very 
strong policy toward inner city revitalization.

11:31.182 --> 11:31.723
If we've got capital projects, for example, of 
equal merit, we're going to put those suckers

11:32.311 --> 11:41.182
inside the loop in the inner city. And that's the 
policy. I see on the map up here the Woodlands and

11:43.685 --> 11:59.905
Tomball, which, well, Tomball is within the 
county and Woodlands is not. People are

12:00.340 --> 12:21.462
experiencing problems now who live in the 
woodlands of commuting into Houston, and I think

12:00.340 --> 12:21.462
that they're attempting to resolve these, not 
perhaps solve them, but resolve them in terms of

12:00.340 --> 12:21.462
carpooling and so forth. Would you care to comment 
on the problem that Houston faces with the impact

12:31.340 --> 12:41.602
of energy on places like the Woodlands, outlying 
communities that have a clear economic

12:31.340 --> 12:41.602
relationship to Houston itself? Well, they've 
got a clear economic relationship, but it may not

12:43.365 --> 12:50.901
be a homework journey related. A good many people 
in the woodlands work in the woodlands. One of the

12:56.448 --> 13:04.099
things that Mental Energy had tried to do was to get 
a contained situation. And there are a number of

13:04.159 --> 13:08.245
vanpools coming from the woodlands in the 
downtown. And there's a number of employers, for

13:08.305 --> 13:11.269
example, that are using vanpools. It's been very, 
very successful here. They've really done well.

13:17.037 --> 13:20.482
Utilization of contraflow lanes. But there's 
Again, I'm quoting a public works deputy

13:21.678 --> 13:28.187
director. We're about 20 years behind in our 
surface transportation streets and maybe 30 in

13:28.227 --> 13:40.764
drainage

13:28.227 --> 13:40.764
because of the magnitude of the growth. And the 
fact that in annexing outlying areas, we picked up

13:40.784 --> 13:48.394
a whole lot of crap, a whole lot of old county roads, 
big crown, deep ditch. And we're having to go in

13:50.774 --> 13:56.799
later and make those up to snuff. And there's no 
real, again, one of the problems that you get with a

13:56.819 --> 14:08.469
non-zoning situation, the only way that we're 
controlling any kind of growth right now is by

13:56.819 --> 14:08.469
sewer permit. And that's by court order. And of 
course, that's not a very good way to control

14:10.171 --> 14:18.178
growth because waste load and waste flow doesn't 
necessarily mean anything. Other than that, I'd

14:18.749 --> 14:23.776
hate to control growth from a sewer standpoint. 
That's probably the last way I'd want to control

14:23.796 --> 14:26.539
it. That's sort of the bottom end of the thing. Yes, 
it is. And the sewage doesn't care. It

14:32.166 --> 14:37.013
is a problem. Is it a policy of the city of Houston 
now to take a look at development directions in

14:37.093 --> 14:48.688
terms of whether or not they will grant a sewer 
permit for the area? I'm sorry? Right now, before

14:51.564 --> 14:59.495
you get a building permit, you have to get a letter 
of availability from the city. So that can mean any

14:59.515 --> 15:01.358
number of things. If a plant is overloaded, you 
don't get a permit. If a collection line,

15:05.624 --> 15:10.571
interceptor source, whatever is overloaded, you 
don't get a permit. But is it all mechanical like

15:10.591 --> 15:12.354
that? Is it merely an engineering consideration, 
or is it a growth policy consideration? By

15:19.702 --> 15:23.746
definition, it's a growth policy consideration, 
but it is an engineering reasoning. In other

15:24.487 --> 15:27.671
words, if the pipes won't handle it, you don't get 
the permit. I wouldn't call that planning by any

15:27.891 --> 15:31.996
stretch of the imagination. It's not like if you 
put an apartment building down here, it's going to

15:32.056 --> 15:39.244
create so many cars that you'll never get up the 
street. That's not considered. What is

15:40.785 --> 15:44.950
considered is if those 160 units are going to 
overflow somewhere. And then you don't get your

15:45.402 --> 15:46.643
permit. And four-fifths of the city, I think, are 
restricted this time to five units to the acre.

15:51.507 --> 15:52.168
Five units to the acre. And that's at a time when we 
ought to be wide open in the inner city. It's a

15:55.751 --> 15:56.932
shame. Because now the market is such that a good 
number of areas could be redeveloped at a higher

15:56.952 --> 16:04.118
density. And we can't do it because we'll all go to 
jail. Because we've got a court order saying we've

16:07.220 --> 16:10.983
got to do this and we've got to do that. Well, Mayor 
McCann was on television recently saying that

16:11.003 --> 16:15.207
they were spending X millions of dollars to double 
the capacity of the sewage treatment facility in

16:15.659 --> 16:21.107
Houston. Could you elaborate on that and also what 
the city expects to be able to do as a consequence?

16:31.723 --> 16:45.143
OK. Well, over the next four years,

16:31.723 --> 16:45.143
the city plans to spend in total funding about $2.4 
billion in physical facilities development.

16:45.950 --> 16:53.561
We've got about $732 million of wastewater 
facilities planned. That includes anticipated

16:53.581 --> 16:58.568
EPA funding and our revenue bonds. We should, at 
the end of 1983,

17:01.152 --> 17:14.792
be able to handle our

17:01.152 --> 17:14.792
projected waste load. on any growth option you 
choose. The major problem in the city is the north

17:18.364 --> 17:26.997
side sewage treatment plant, which covers 
roughly the north half of the city. And it was

17:28.540 --> 17:36.532
designed for about 50 MGD, and it was liable to run 
75 or 100 on a wet day. We've got a multi-million

17:37.614 --> 17:39.717
dollar I think it's about 150 million and counting 
sister plant to that one, located on the bio around

17:40.118 --> 17:49.788
the loop. When you say on a wet day, that causes me to 
wonder if the sewage system for Houston has been

17:49.808 --> 18:02.661
divided into storm sewers and domestic sewers. 
Yes, it has been. They're separate. They're

18:05.684 --> 18:06.986
separate? Yes. I think the last combination 
sewer, I think, was downtown. I think we did away

18:10.274 --> 18:11.396
with it. What we do have is portions of the system 
that have just worn out. And you do get your

18:15.901 --> 18:17.964
infiltration. I see. Okay, well, you're worlds 
ahead of San Francisco. No, we don't do combined.

18:23.691 --> 18:30.339
No, to treat stormwater runoff in the city of 
Houston, no, we couldn't afford it. I mean, that's

18:31.501 --> 18:32.462
dumb. We don't want to do that. Anywhere. No, no. No 
way, Jose. Uh-uh. No, but we, you know, in our water

18:38.118 --> 18:46.007
system, the same way we're looking to spend 
roughly the same amount of money on the water

18:38.118 --> 18:46.007
system. It needs to be reworked. We have a loop 
system. It's one system throughout the city. And

18:56.218 --> 19:05.649
we're looking at improving it, a major rework of 
that system. With EPA funds? No, there's no EPA

19:06.282 --> 19:08.125
funds for water. We do it on our rates. And 
therefore, we're looking at increased water

19:10.668 --> 19:16.978
rates.

19:16.998 --> 19:25.791
But people are having to pay now, I think, for the 
luxury that they were afforded 10 years ago. I

19:26.011 --> 19:31.900
think that the bullet was beginning to be bitten 
with hawkins, and I think the mayor now has bitten

19:26.011 --> 19:31.900
even more of it. But we've got to do it. It's very 
unpleasant and politically very unpopular. But

19:36.728 --> 19:38.730
somebody's got to pay the piper. And the balloon 
notes do. OK,

19:42.153 --> 20:03.272
well, Rick, there have been critics of 
architecture and of planning in the past who have

19:42.153 --> 20:03.272
noticed certain characteristics about Houston, 
which they have commented upon in one way or

20:03.961 --> 20:17.153
another, usually with some negative thoughts.

20:17.173 --> 20:22.197
Do you believe that the planning process exists in 
Houston?

20:23.659 --> 20:25.080
Do you believe that it's effective? Do you think 
that it's capable in terms of what we as planners

20:32.513 --> 20:40.346
identify as a planning process to handle the 
challenges of the future in Houston? Yeah, I think

20:40.366 --> 20:47.819
regardless of... What changes would you, you 
know, envision as being appropriate? Well, one

20:47.839 --> 20:55.632
thing I have a problem with planning and planners 
about is that they don't want to be political. That

20:56.674 --> 20:58.116
they are the I don't remember which idiot wrote it, 
but saying they just merely make recommendations

20:58.535 --> 21:04.422
to the decision maker. Well, to me, if you're not 
political, then you're not in the decision

21:04.442 --> 21:10.610
process. So I would suggest, you know, somebody 
telling me they're not going to be political, I'm

21:11.811 --> 21:19.861
going to tell them to drop dead because I don't want 
to hear what they're saying because it's not going

21:11.811 --> 21:19.861
to matter. So to me, planning, the worst thing 
that's happened to planning is that it got out of

21:21.543 --> 21:27.090
the politics. Because the politics are what makes 
the decisions. Whereas I think that some planning

21:31.615 --> 21:45.634
expertise interjected into the political 
process could be much better than sitting over

21:31.615 --> 21:45.634
there and all those weirdos over here talking 
about this shit that they don't know anything

21:31.615 --> 21:45.634
about. We're going to do this because I got the 
money. It's the golden rule. I got the role. The

21:49.199 --> 21:50.140
gold makes the rules. I find that we do have a 
planning process here. It's very political. I

21:58.019 --> 22:11.374
think that more planning rules, planning theory, 
is being interjected into the decision process

21:58.019 --> 22:11.374
here, whereas before it wasn't. I think people are 
more interested in planning considerations now

22:11.394 --> 22:19.863
rather than pure economic considerations than 
there were before. And I see that happening for the

22:19.903 --> 22:23.267
virtue of me being appointed where I am. Who wants a 
planter on their goddamn stand? And so I feel that

22:27.878 --> 22:38.888
the planting profession itself has done itself an 
injustice by not being political, not getting in

22:27.878 --> 22:38.888
there and, you know, well, I recommended no. Well, 
you know, that was ridiculous. And so you're clean

22:41.231 --> 22:43.032
and free. And I think too many planters cover their 
ass first without thinking for a minute why their

22:43.312 --> 22:50.599
ass is there in the first place. And I think that's 
the major failing of planting. And I think in

22:54.500 --> 23:21.317
defense of the houston planning process you know 
there are a lot of planners around here that may not

22:54.500 --> 23:21.317
call themselves planners but to me planning for 
something without any insurance that it's going

22:54.500 --> 23:21.317
to occur is sort of a futile exercise and i think 
that that planning in a sense of houston without

22:54.500 --> 23:21.317
the zoning traditional land use management or 
controls or whatever You know, I think we have a

23:21.533 --> 23:23.776
planning process. It might be between me and the 
director of public works and the mayor and a couple

23:23.896 --> 23:40.518
of developers, but there is a process by which 
development occurs and regardless of how

23:23.896 --> 23:40.518
disorderly it may appear, we know it's happening. 
You know, again, there has been an absence of

23:41.258 --> 23:50.190
planning regimens stuck into the decision 
process and I think that it's turning around here

23:51.487 --> 24:19.182
roscoe may disagree with me but i i find that that's 
the case i find that's a major shortcoming of

23:51.487 --> 24:19.182
planners in general as they refuse to be political 
with the exception of maybe what's his name in san

23:51.487 --> 24:19.182
francisco no jacobs jacobs yeah jacobs kind of got 
in there yeah but most planning directors don't

23:51.487 --> 24:19.182
roy alcobar you know was removed unceremoniously 
a couple of weeks ago i didn't know that Of course,

24:19.702 --> 24:23.687
he's an architect now, aside from that. But could 
you briefly

24:24.048 --> 24:40.991
give us a kind of a thumbnail sketch of the planning 
process in Houston, aside from the generalities?

24:41.031 --> 24:49.523
There's a planning department, and then, of 
course, your role here in the mayor's office, and

24:41.031 --> 24:49.523
then there's council and all that. Well,

24:50.262 --> 24:58.292
I'm not real sure I understand what you're saying. 
I'm not quite sure how to ask the question. I'm

25:00.374 --> 25:02.116
trying to figure out what tool.

25:05.821 --> 25:09.646
We're talking about physical facilities 
planning. I think basically most people planning

25:10.306 --> 25:13.210
think of land use planning. But an overall 
resource allocation, which I consider planning.

25:20.350 --> 25:30.424
But for example, is there much opportunity for 
private citizens to be involved in the process?

25:31.926 --> 25:39.757
Are there any citizens groups that are pressure 
groups, advocacy groups in Houston? Do they have

25:39.857 --> 25:48.990
any effect on the overall process of community 
development at all? In terms of the, it just

25:49.240 --> 25:56.448
depends on the myriad of programs we have. In 
community development, for example, City

25:56.608 --> 26:00.772
Museum, they have a direct input. I mean, they get 
to pick what they want, basically, unless it runs

26:00.792 --> 26:06.078
uphill or something. The city, by and large, does 
that. For a while, Houston had mobile city halls in

26:10.462 --> 26:17.289
the neighborhood, as I remember, under the model 
cities program. Yes, we did. when the citizens

26:18.029 --> 26:31.308
could go into their own neighborhood city hall and 
they wouldn't feel so intimidated about

26:18.029 --> 26:31.308
appearing in a municipal edifice. They would 
happen to be a trader in their neighborhood park,

26:31.328 --> 26:42.664
whereas they might feel somewhat more 
apprehensive about coming to city hall and

26:31.328 --> 26:42.664
attending a city council meeting. Well, of 
course, the thing that the Model City program did

26:45.518 --> 26:49.522
throughout the country, I think, was show the 
people the way to city hall. It did so here. And we

26:51.324 --> 27:00.073
have numerous citizens appearing before the city 
council as well as getting calls all day about

26:51.324 --> 27:00.073
complaints. We don't have as active an inspection 
and keeping our own house because of just the sheer

27:12.603 --> 27:16.789
570 square miles of the city because people ride 
around trying to find things wrong. We barely can

27:17.450 --> 27:18.412
do that. The city has gotten much more responsive, 
I think, with the new council since we switched

27:18.452 --> 27:34.215
from an at-large to a district council at 
answering citizen complaints. But it's

27:34.355 --> 27:38.982
basically up to the citizen to say, hey, my 
street's messed up or hey, my water line's broken

27:39.518 --> 27:48.689
because we just don't have the resources to do 
that. We barely have enough resources to get

27:48.709 --> 27:51.193
things fixed. But I mean, it's not like it's just 
spread out. I mean, the physical, the

27:57.761 --> 28:09.255
geographical makeup of the city is such that it's 
really very difficult to do proper maintenance.

28:09.910 --> 28:27.095
Another question I have is, in view of the fact that 
Houston has this incredible economy,

28:09.910 --> 28:27.095
how is it that the city can't take care of its 
day-to-day needs and just keep things patched up

28:09.910 --> 28:27.095
and so forth? I mean, a lot of communities I can 
think of offhand would be delighted to have some of

28:27.235 --> 28:38.331
the industrial base that Houston has as revenue 
potential. Is there some problem with the revenue

28:39.408 --> 28:41.951
aspect of this?

28:45.615 --> 28:59.452
No, it may be a matter of whether or not the city 
council will agree to tax the citizenry at a rate

28:45.615 --> 28:59.452
required to hire the people and provide the 
material. When you say the citizenry, do you mean

29:01.274 --> 29:03.737
residences? I'm talking about the ad valorem tax, 
which is the large share of our... OK. Applied to

29:09.851 --> 29:12.013
industrial plants as well. Just the fact that the 
taxes that we're bringing in are insufficient in

29:12.033 --> 29:23.504
most people's minds to do the job. Last year, for 
example, the mayor proposed a 10 cent tax increase

29:23.544 --> 29:36.195
for street maintenance, which would raise, I 
don't know what it is, 1,600,000 per penny in a

29:36.597 --> 29:39.881
millage, and the council turning down.

29:43.204 --> 29:58.342
We are in a tax freeze with 77 values, and this year 
we're in deep trouble because of inflation,

29:43.204 --> 29:58.342
frozen tax values, and an election year. So 
they're not about to raise taxes in an election

29:58.962 --> 30:01.806
year. So we're really in trouble this year, and 
it's a bad time for anybody than to be running for

30:05.926 --> 30:09.170
office right now because there's just not enough 
money. We ran out of money to pick up the garbage

30:09.851 --> 30:12.715
last year. We've run out of money, and we're just 
not

30:12.735 --> 30:22.668
really responsive to the needs of the city 
government. It's like, well, we've got to save

30:23.449 --> 30:26.413
money.

30:28.296 --> 30:31.680
Time to retrench and tread water a bit. Yeah, yeah. 
That's sort of what it is, increased verbosity.

30:38.158 --> 30:58.883
Now the other two points that I wanted to mention is 
one in terms of transportation planning in the

30:38.158 --> 30:58.883
city of Houston that I don't feel personally as a 
planner that the transit solution, be it a myriad

30:38.158 --> 30:58.883
of buses, heavy rail system, or whatever in itself 
is going to solve our problems in the city of

30:59.167 --> 31:05.113
Houston. I think that basically it's a land use 
solution, and some controls need to be applied to

31:05.133 --> 31:17.446
ensure the success of the system and that the 
system works. Because you just can't superimpose

31:18.087 --> 31:25.815
a grid on 570 square miles of the city and expect 
everybody to be able to go where they need to go.
