WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:26.848
our woods hole people had made any real 
comparisons between them so first i chose lamont

00:01.550 --> 00:26.848
one to use here at the same time that the regular 
woods holding was being used and then chose

00:01.550 --> 00:26.848
another one later and we kept on experimenting 
until we got the one we think was the best that was

00:01.550 --> 00:26.848
the best another problem was out of the sound 
source and so we built Heretofore at Woods Hole

00:27.301 --> 00:33.989
we'd been using sparkers, so we built a big 
sparker. It was bigger than the one that the others

00:34.009 --> 00:36.572
had here, that's right. And then finally we went on 
to air guns, and now continue to use those. Another

00:43.579 --> 00:55.553
aspect was the receiving of the detection of the 
echoes, and so we made a new kind of a detection

00:43.579 --> 00:55.553
array. Not really very complicated, but one with 
about 200 detectors in it. And the people at Woods

01:03.959 --> 01:09.348
Hole began using that about the same time, so it's 
hard to know who was first on it. Then we wanted to

01:10.670 --> 01:20.725
improve the system, so eventually we started 
digitizing the single channel. That was really

01:20.745 --> 01:25.472
near the end of the geological survey 
participation. And then after it was digitized,

01:26.347 --> 01:33.521
then we could stack and deconvolve and do other 
things with it. And then finally that led to using

01:33.541 --> 01:37.188
two multi-channel arrays. The ship is out now with 
a 12-channel multi, 12-channel assessment

01:37.208 --> 01:45.705
reflection equipment.

01:49.212 --> 01:54.417
What sort of conclusions are you reaching with 
sounding at this time? Well, what we are mainly

01:54.437 --> 02:13.634
interested in and have been here at the 
institution is to learn much about the origin of

01:54.437 --> 02:13.634
the continental slope and the shelf and rise, in 
effect, to know why continents exist and what the

01:54.437 --> 02:13.634
difference is between the continents and the 
ocean basins. In the process of doing that, of

02:13.654 --> 02:19.219
course, then we learn a lot about the structure of 
the continental margin. particularly the shelf

02:19.672 --> 02:21.234
and the slope. And very often this structure shows 
the potential, the areas of potential oil and gas

02:21.955 --> 02:33.007
provinces. It doesn't locate places to drill. It 
doesn't locate oil fields, but it locates wide

02:35.630 --> 02:40.034
regions that have potential. And on the east coast 
here, one of the first things that we did was to show

02:41.015 --> 02:48.784
that was to compare the seismic reflection work 
that we did with previous work that Lamont had done

02:49.928 --> 03:16.341
with seismic refraction and to verify and extend 
the presence of large potential oil and gas

02:49.928 --> 03:16.341
distributions beneath the shelf, actually 
beneath George's Bank in what is now known as the

02:49.928 --> 03:16.341
Baltimore Canyon region and farther south near 
Jacksonville. Those areas were mapped about

03:16.912 --> 03:30.609
1963, 63 or 64,

03:16.912 --> 03:30.609
with the statement as necessary to drill holes to 
find out whether there actually is any oil and gas

03:16.912 --> 03:30.609
present. The areas still haven't been leased 
offshore. And so it's clear that the problem

03:33.252 --> 03:46.108
facing the people of the United States is a lack of 
interest in the part of the government on finding

03:33.252 --> 03:46.108
energy supplies rather than to find sources of 
revenue for the Treasury. So, of course, this sort

03:50.392 --> 04:04.553
of thinking soon led to an emphasis on political 
oceanography, and there's a tremendous amount of

03:50.392 --> 04:04.553
that, for example, by the United Nations, with 
manganese nodules and other things. So it's a

04:04.573 --> 04:07.097
different kind of a field. I've been interested in 
that, because it's just one more obstacle for

04:07.558 --> 04:14.728
marine geologists.

04:15.620 --> 04:20.827
And you remained then in this kind of work here at 
Woods Hole. Yes. I've been here now 15 years, and

04:22.109 --> 04:28.978
most of that time has been spent on geophysics. And 
it's now time for another change, or it was a few

04:28.998 --> 04:32.462
years ago. So I've changed now to synthesis of 
large aspects of oceanography. first by working

04:40.375 --> 04:49.830
with one of my associates, a former student, 
Elazar Yachupi, on a memoir for the Western North

04:40.375 --> 04:49.830
Atlantic Ocean. It was published by the American 
Association of Petroleum Geologists. This was in

04:53.556 --> 04:57.282
1972, which was a pretty good time for it to come 
out. And it was kind of a parallel to the book of

04:58.204 --> 05:01.950
Southern California. And now we are working 
together on another one, a synthesis for the

05:02.731 --> 05:07.699
entire Atlantic Ocean. 60 degrees south to 60 
degrees north. That's the stratigraphy of the

05:11.166 --> 05:26.291
Atlantic, the structure of it, the sediments, the 
rocks, the relationship to the biology and to the

05:11.166 --> 05:26.291
physical oceanography, currents and waves and so 
forth. So this will keep us out of mischief for

05:26.311 --> 05:28.896
another couple years. Yeah, I should think so.

05:33.937 --> 05:40.024
I have now several questions concerning what 
amounts to the development of oceanography in

05:33.937 --> 05:40.024
terms of money. By the way, how did you miss service 
in the O&R office? I was asked at the very beginning

05:44.108 --> 05:51.896
in 1950, I think, but I was rather more interested 
in teaching. And in the research, it was

05:53.658 --> 06:00.045
completely evident that one can't do research 
administration at the same time. In fact, many

06:02.232 --> 06:11.240
people make the mistake of thinking they can 
teach, do research, and administer all at the same

06:02.232 --> 06:11.240
time, and no one is successful at doing all three of 
them. You can do one successfully and sometimes

06:11.260 --> 06:16.685
one and a half successfully. So going to ONR would 
have been the wrong direction. I chose the same way

06:21.310 --> 06:24.012
as far as being dean here, too. You can't 
administer as a dean and do any effective research

06:24.373 --> 06:29.037
either. button, so therefore your career has 
always pointed towards research and teaching.

06:35.706 --> 06:41.174
Yeah, and since I left the University of Illinois, 
University of Southern California, not

06:35.706 --> 06:41.174
teaching. I taught there 15 or 16 years and enjoyed 
it very much. In fact, the students wrote a little

06:45.922 --> 06:55.296
book in commemoration when I left there, 
dedicated

06:45.922 --> 06:55.296
to me. But the After 15 years of teaching, you don't 
really expect to find many new experiences in

06:56.894 --> 07:01.900
teaching. So I would rather go to something new and 
different rather than repeat the old. I have had

07:08.147 --> 07:10.009
one or two students here. One is the number one. Now 
the number one is really marine geologist.

07:19.320 --> 07:23.165
But when you came to Woods Hole, was there even a 
teaching program here? No, that didn't begin

07:23.185 --> 07:25.588
until five years later. OK. six years later in 
1968. I was the first dean, acting dean. An acting

07:33.083 --> 07:42.713
dean is, of course, by definition, a mouse 
learning to be a rat.

07:43.815 --> 07:54.947
In the beginnings, if I may use that word, like 45, 
46, 47 and so, it was almost as if block grants were

07:43.815 --> 07:54.947
given to institutions. by ONR and what have you. 
And then you drew your monies that way. I didn't

08:00.977 --> 08:03.440
think the ONR began until 1950. Well, it didn't. 
I'm talking about the first grants to come out of

08:04.341 --> 08:09.988
the Naval office and then in the early years of the 
ONR. Yeah. At that time, I didn't ask for any

08:10.749 --> 08:17.457
because just going into teaching, there was 
enough to do there for a while. OK. That was what I

08:17.477 --> 08:18.978
wanted to know. When did you start? And then in 
addition, Captain Alan Hancock, who was a great

08:23.412 --> 08:37.910
beneficiary of the University of Southern 
California, built a new ship called the Valero IV,

08:23.412 --> 08:37.910
and it was available in 1947 for cruises in all 
phases of oceanography. So I used that ship quite a

08:37.930 --> 08:41.635
lot in those days. So you had enough ship time then 
without looking for research rates? Yeah. When

08:47.522 --> 08:51.327
did you begin to have your research funded by the 
government?

08:54.428 --> 09:07.779
We started working on the sort of expensive parts 
of the

08:54.428 --> 09:07.779
sediment work, where we had to buy new equipment 
and pay salaries of assistants and so forth. So I

09:08.320 --> 09:16.107
guess the first of those was probably about 1948, I 
suppose, after we'd gotten some cores from using

09:08.320 --> 09:16.107
Laurel 4. That was with Rittenberg and 
Wilson-Ower. With whom did you make contact first

09:21.491 --> 09:23.473
for money?

09:27.908 --> 09:36.998
Probably Gordon Little, who was the head of the ONR 
at that time. I think that's who it was. He's now, I

09:38.780 --> 09:41.002
don't know where he is now. Noah. Oh, yes, that's 
right. He went to Noah by way of lucky. Right. Did

09:46.348 --> 09:50.693
you...

09:51.415 --> 09:54.580
Did you find it necessary then to issue a formal 
proposal? Probably. I've forgotten now, but

09:56.062 --> 10:00.087
yeah, I would have. I made proposals whenever 
there were agencies to make them to, and never had

10:00.107 --> 10:06.156
any great problem with the money. In fact, Shell 
Oil Company provided, I think, about $40,000 for

10:06.877 --> 10:14.588
general work on on porphyrin pigments in the 
sediments, which we're interested in, and that

10:15.547 --> 10:23.795
money hasn't been so much of a problem. For the 
geological survey work, I think the budget there,

10:23.815 --> 10:37.388
not counting salaries of their own people, came to 
something like an average of half a million a year,

10:23.815 --> 10:37.388
probably.

10:38.189 --> 10:42.853
And then at the end of that, started work on an 
African program, the entire west coast of Africa,

10:43.120 --> 10:51.552
and $2.5 million was provided. That includes the 
price, the cost of the ship time, by

10:51.813 --> 11:01.687
ideally an half a decade of ocean exploration. It 
was a five-year program. Oh, yes, and before that,

11:03.530 --> 11:12.283
then, I'd done work along the Asian coast, from 
Korea down to Java, and this was partly funded by by

11:13.293 --> 11:23.466
the Navy through mainly bureau ships, I think, and 
by National Science Foundation. And a lot of it is

11:23.486 --> 11:28.152
just done without any

11:23.486 --> 11:28.152
funding. But I'm to take it, though, that largely 
that money was not any problem in terms of... No, it

11:28.172 --> 11:35.021
didn't seem to be. It hasn't seemed to be. Is that 
still true? Well, it is for me because a couple

11:38.986 --> 11:41.950
years ago, I was given a big, low chair here, which 
provides salary and allows me to work on what I want

11:42.925 --> 11:51.674
to work on. So if at the time I'm holding that, if I 
went out to seek funds to do specified work, it'd be

11:52.214 --> 12:00.403
a poor use of the funds for the chair. With the funds 
for the chair, I can work on the synthesis here

12:01.624 --> 12:06.869
without spending time raising funds. Good, good. 
It's your impression that funds available for

12:09.652 --> 12:12.595
oceanography or declining? Well, I think the 
funds are increasing. But the funds are declining

12:18.420 --> 12:23.467
if you put it in terms of constant dollars. For 
example, here, that's more political

12:23.928 --> 12:27.092
oceanography. But here at the Oceanographic 
Institution, the funds in 1971 were about $12

12:27.112 --> 12:34.742
million for operations. And in 76, they were $23 
million. But if you put them in terms of $1967, it's

12:40.975 --> 12:45.140
constant funding. That means then that 
effectively the $11 additional revenue between

12:45.801 --> 13:07.286
19, the annual revenue between 1971 and 77 really 
is just keeping up with the devaluation of the

12:45.801 --> 13:07.286
dollar. Now, it's clear that that the funds, even 
the inflated funds for small organizations,

13:09.865 --> 13:19.475
small oceanographic organizations, are falling 
and have fallen. And that's not unreasonable

13:20.596 --> 13:33.509
because there are only three or four places that 
are large enough and have people who are

13:20.596 --> 13:33.509
experienced enough in all fields of oceanography 
so they can tackle large problems. Of course,

13:33.829 --> 13:39.535
there's an argument about whether people, 
research workers, should work on smaller and

13:33.829 --> 13:39.535
smaller problems know more and more about less and 
less, or the other way, less and less about more and

13:40.038 --> 13:44.703
more. But in any case, the large institutions, 
that is, Woods Hole, Lamont, Scripps, chiefly

13:44.723 --> 14:04.645
those are ones where large problems can be tackled 
and are being tackled, large multi-institution,

13:44.723 --> 14:04.645
multinational programs. are being undertaken 
just mostly by those. The other places sometimes

14:08.251 --> 14:19.306
supply individuals to work, but they can't, 
mostly they can't be deeply involved in it,

14:08.251 --> 14:19.306
because they don't have the people. Now, the 
funding itself is sort of everything. For a

14:23.492 --> 14:28.719
program like Africa, I considered the funding to 
be one quarter of the job. The politics, another

14:29.120 --> 14:32.264
quarter, you have to get permission from. And 
there's a lot of problems, even in spite of the in

14:36.248 --> 14:42.115
spite of and not helped by the State Department, so 
to speak. Then there's the problem of technology.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.681
You have to invent new equipment to improve on the 
previous ones. And then finally, there's the

14:47.701 --> 14:50.384
science that you do it all for. So in effect, a large 
program calls for all four of these. And there are a

14:54.008 --> 14:59.254
lot of large programs that are developed. In fact, 
one can tie this to different phases of

14:59.274 --> 15:03.979
oceanography. For biology. the greatest 
paradigm or generalization was that of Darwin's,

15:06.050 --> 15:23.011
who showed the effects of environment on the 
production of species and the distribution of

15:06.050 --> 15:23.011
species. And since that time, lots of the 
biologists have been sort of proving that and not

15:24.013 --> 15:33.284
so much developing new approaches. It's the broad 
generalization of more than 100 years ago that's

15:35.699 --> 15:45.474
kind of rested new approaches in the field of 
biology. In chemistry, on the other hand, the

15:45.875 --> 16:02.781
challenge of exploration of about 100 years ago, I 
had a man named Dittmar who did the chemistry of the

15:45.875 --> 16:02.781
waters and found that the ions bear a fairly 
constant ratio of each other throughout the

15:45.875 --> 16:02.781
oceans. That was his main generalization. It was a 
new generalization, and it's a useful one. Now the

16:08.185 --> 16:14.073
main interest is to find in what ways the elements 
depart from the close ratio. In other words, what

16:14.113 --> 16:17.117
are the anomalies, and what are those anomalies 
due to? Some are due to evaporation, some to influx

16:17.738 --> 16:23.386
of seawater, some to, many of them, to biological 
influences. Others are due to seafloor

16:23.466 --> 16:30.336
circulation associated with the plate 
tectonics. For physical oceanography, the main

16:30.356 --> 16:34.782
generalization was by a man named Bjorknes in the 
in Norway, and he showed that you could measure the

16:35.150 --> 16:52.869
dynamic height of the ocean surface and from that 
compute currents in the same way you'd do currents

16:35.150 --> 16:52.869
with wind, with meteorological observations. 
That was a broad generalization. And that was

16:54.972 --> 16:57.094
followed for a long time. Now the main approach is 
the knowledge that those currents make up only a

17:02.673 --> 17:07.199
small amount of the movement in the ocean, perhaps 
only 1%. The rest is turbulence. And in order to

17:09.241 --> 17:14.889
learn about broad turbulence, it's necessary to 
make synoptic observations at many points at the

17:09.241 --> 17:14.889
same time. So the physical oceanographers mainly 
are dealing with buoys. Many buoys in the ocean

17:18.573 --> 17:20.796
record for several months. The geologists were 
very slow, in a way. They were the last to form a

17:24.461 --> 17:27.805
broad generalization. And that was formed only a 
decade ago. It's the plate tectonics hypothesis.

17:32.845 --> 17:41.678
or theory, and now that's served as a framework 
into which many kinds of marine geology can now be

17:32.845 --> 17:41.678
fitted. How did we get into this? We got into this 
because after these generalizations, we have to

17:43.260 --> 17:54.436
look for anomalies and details that weren't 
appreciated and weren't needed and weren't

17:43.260 --> 17:54.436
understood beforehand. And these are more 
expensive ways of working. Now, in order to do

17:58.342 --> 18:02.768
this, we have several programs going on here. One 
was the famous expedition using the submarines in

18:02.950 --> 18:09.996
the middle Atlantic Ocean. We wanted to make a 
continuation of that in a different environment,

18:10.537 --> 18:28.772
so we made studies in the Cayman Trough last year, 
and then this year, similar sort of thing in the

18:10.537 --> 18:28.772
Galapagos rise from the area sea floor spreading 
in Galapagos. Each of these three areas happens to

18:28.933 --> 18:31.675
be areas of active seafloor spreading, but each is 
vastly different. Each has unexpected fallout.

18:38.736 --> 18:53.471
Galapagos people came back all enthusiastic 
because in addition to the very useful geological

18:38.736 --> 18:53.471
observations, they found many deep-sea clams a 
foot or so long living at a depth of 2,800 meters.

18:53.531 --> 19:01.459
There's no obvious source of food for them except 
oxidation of the hydrogen sulfide from the

18:53.531 --> 19:01.459
escaping bottom water. that was escaping bottom

19:02.063 --> 19:07.392
water. It's seawater that had been drawn into the 
area of seafloor spreading and expelled after it

19:07.412 --> 19:18.049
heated and picked up some elements and lost its 
oxygen, picked up hydrogen sulfide. Anyway, all

19:18.069 --> 19:27.144
these multidisciplinary,

19:18.069 --> 19:27.144
multi-equipment types of studies are very 
expensive. And the small wind stations cannot

19:29.570 --> 19:40.359
cannot man them or staff them usually.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.502
Go ahead. In your work towards a broad synthesis 
that you're aiming for, do you see a work towards

19:43.522 --> 19:55.753
broad synthesis in all fields of oceanography? 
Yeah, certainly that's true. I mentioned the

19:58.612 --> 20:04.602
biology, the chemistry, the physics, and the 
geology. The chemistry one is well illustrated by

20:04.622 --> 20:20.728
the geosex work, which very sophisticated 
equipment was used for investigating the

20:04.622 --> 20:20.728
anomalies of ratios and other things. The biology 
is farther behind. The biology work has taken some

20:25.527 --> 20:51.822
interesting new approaches, however, though, 
measuring the metabolic activity of benthic

20:25.527 --> 20:51.822
organisms through using submarines to place 
units on the bottom to trap water associated with

20:25.527 --> 20:51.822
organisms and find out how much, how fast the 
oxygen is used to recover the equipment for the

20:25.527 --> 20:51.822
submarine and measure the changes. One of the 
interesting things is to find that the metabolic

20:52.949 --> 21:03.822
activity is very low, therefore the animals may 
live for several hundred years, maybe some of them

20:52.949 --> 21:03.822
a thousand years. This first came to light in a way 
by finding that when we lost our submarine for ten

21:05.744 --> 21:16.497
and a half months, the sandwiches that were in the 
submarine were pretty well preserved. When they

21:16.557 --> 21:21.943
finally recovered, though, they'd been 
destroyed by bacteria at the surface. Butter and

21:22.463 --> 21:27.508
bacteria are not used to sandwiches.

21:27.528 --> 21:35.056
But it's cold and high pressure, and both the cold 
and the high pressure reduces the metabolic

21:27.528 --> 21:35.056
activity. If you were offering advice to a young 
oceanographer on what direction he should direct

21:35.076 --> 21:45.087
his career, what would you tell him? Well, this 
happens very often. I tell them to get a

21:48.097 --> 22:02.490
first-class degree, bachelor's degree, in one of 
the major fields of oceanography before they

21:48.097 --> 22:02.490
start specializing in the ocean so that they'll 
know enough about one field to be able to handle it

21:48.097 --> 22:02.490
well. The places that have turned out bachelor's 
degree oceanographers give a smattering of

22:03.130 --> 22:12.199
things that people don't generally know enough to 
do any effective work. I don't know of any

22:12.559 --> 22:17.243
graduates from that who've gotten their 
doctorates, but there may be some. I recommend

22:18.117 --> 22:29.650
that you take, if you were to be a geologist, that 
you take all two courses in biology, chemistry,

22:18.117 --> 22:29.650
and physics. In fact, you ought to have a thorough 
background so as to be able to build that. Now, this

22:33.855 --> 22:38.080
is different from what the students nowadays want 
to do. Most students want to become specialists. I

22:41.084 --> 22:46.191
always used to tell my students that they should be 
generalists, and they'll know when to hire a

22:41.084 --> 22:46.191
specialist. They'll also know when the 
specialist has come to the point of diminishing

22:46.211 --> 22:52.080
returns and be able to fire him. And some of the 
students have taken that advice. They're now

22:54.023 --> 22:59.150
presidents of companies

22:54.023 --> 22:59.150
and so forth. And after he's received, then, firm 
scientific education, and is choosing a career in

23:03.916 --> 23:09.927
oceanography. What branch of oceanography 
should he move into? Of course, that depends

23:13.894 --> 23:16.959
entirely on the man, what the man's interests are. 
I have recommended to some people in each of the

23:17.921 --> 23:21.488
different fields. It really depends, and the 
man's interests are usually developed

23:22.409 --> 23:27.358
accidentally through through having a family 
friend who may be a geologist or a family friend who

23:28.081 --> 23:37.351
may be a biologist.

23:37.511 --> 23:42.416
And it's just an accident what people become 
interested in. Very few people, I suppose very few

23:42.476 --> 23:49.384
people, go into a field that a vocational expert is 
selected for. I don't know of any. But it's usually

23:53.027 --> 23:54.149
an accident. Mine was an accident. of getting a 
grafting job with Shepard Purex. If another job

24:04.200 --> 24:12.068
available to Illinois, as far as I know, that was 
the only one, then I might be in some other field.

24:12.088 --> 24:13.850
Many fields are interesting. Pacto was once going 
to be an archaeologist, and I talked with a

24:13.870 --> 24:23.620
professional archaeologist, and he gave about 
the same advice that Ravel had given. a field where

24:24.325 --> 24:47.228
in order to be successful you have to have a private 
income of your own which i didn't happen to have but

24:24.325 --> 24:47.228
now i've been finding it interesting to work in the 
field of archaeology of the ocean floor and i still

24:24.325 --> 24:47.228
come back to it occasionally archaeology of the 
ocean floor yeah sure you don't mean nautical

24:24.325 --> 24:47.228
archaeology no not necessarily for example At the 
height of the past, of the last, latest glacier,

24:49.334 --> 24:57.862
about 14,000 years ago, the whole shelf was 
exposed because sea level was low. Man lived out on

24:58.563 --> 24:59.824
the shelf. There were lots of elephants out there. 
We'd find their teeth and so forth. Lots of

25:03.908 --> 25:07.652
oysters, lots of fish, lots of birds, lots of small 
games. There's no reason why man shouldn't have

25:07.672 --> 25:09.714
been there. And on the east coast of North America, 
lots of dated, carbon-dated manned sites are

25:10.014 --> 25:19.223
known on land as far back as 12,000 years. There's a 
great influx of people about 12,000 years ago. In

25:24.492 --> 25:35.487
fact, it's thought that as these people 
progressed across northern North America, they

25:24.492 --> 25:35.487
practiced overkill and had to move out as they 
eliminated the elephants and the bison and the

25:24.492 --> 25:35.487
larger animals. And so, people lived on the shelf. 
We really haven't very good evidence for their

25:38.712 --> 25:48.906
being there, but we have good evidence of being on 
the shore, and they certainly would have gone on

25:38.712 --> 25:48.906
the shelf, regardless of whether the shelf was a 
whether they knew they were on the ocean floor or

25:49.932 --> 25:52.014
not. For example, if you ask the people in New York 
City if they're living on the ocean floor, of

25:52.035 --> 25:58.843
course they'd say no. But if all the glaciers were 
to melt, the sea level would rise about 60 meters,

25:59.644 --> 26:08.694
about 200 feet. It would cover all except the about 
30-story buildings. So they're living on the

26:14.350 --> 26:26.288
ocean floor, so no reason why people shouldn't 
have lived on the ocean floor before. I had no idea

26:26.469 --> 26:30.655
there was... You're not systematically 
cataloging sites out there, though, are you?

26:31.411 --> 26:35.997
Yeah, well, not so much sites as things relate to 
it. We found about 50 elephant teeth on the

26:36.537 --> 26:46.169
seafloor and probably at least a dozen freshwater 
peats on the seafloor that we accommodated. The

26:46.190 --> 26:48.052
peats show that there were forests and meadows. 
The elephants, some elephants occupied the

26:48.072 --> 26:53.278
meadows and some of the forests. A lot of other 
animals, too. Deer, elk, sloths. The small

26:57.922 --> 27:05.172
animals, like rabbits and so forth, have bones 
that are too fragile to be preserved. At least we

27:05.192 --> 27:06.254
haven't found any yet. There are probably some who 
went to the right places. And there had to be early

27:09.438 --> 27:13.444
man out there, too. But man's burials, lots of the 
early man perhaps didn't make burials. So bones

27:19.933 --> 27:22.918
just decompose at the surface. And if they buried 
them, then of course, that's harder to find them

27:23.459 --> 27:27.304
then. But it's an important thing. Now, of course, 
nowadays we have people in the government bureaus

27:30.406 --> 27:41.110
who insist that archaeological work be done 
before offshore development is done. But there's

27:42.473 --> 27:45.900
a difference between the requirements and the 
efficiency of the search. the response to that

27:46.673 --> 27:48.876
requirement. I don't think they're fine with her. 
Most are found by amateurs, I think. Yeah. Yeah.

27:54.004 --> 27:57.069
But I didn't know that they had impact studies for 
offshore. Yeah, they do. They all shall not build

27:58.270 --> 28:04.099
offshore wells without first having made an 
archaeological survey. And if you find evidence

28:04.119 --> 28:08.386
of it, then, of course, you're not supposed to 
build a well there. But same way for roads on the

28:08.406 --> 28:10.048
land.
