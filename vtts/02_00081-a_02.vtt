WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:25.245
for promotion and tenure were good standards in 
the department kind of tough there were a couple of

00:02.984 --> 00:25.245
people that came through who didn't make who were 
actually let go uh so as uh dean as dean byers

00:02.984 --> 00:25.245
becomes vice president for academic affairs earl 
cook follows him correct describe earl cook as the

00:02.984 --> 00:25.245
dean Well, Earl was a little different than Byers. 
I don't really remember too much. He was more

00:32.878 --> 00:36.442
involved than Byers was. But you could never go by 
that, because Byers was such a quiet kind of guy.

00:41.486 --> 00:47.192
And things got done, and things were really 
running very well under Byers' tenure. Cook

00:48.293 --> 00:49.254
continued that. He continued to do a good job. He 
was more visible and more vocal. But the quality of

00:55.600 --> 01:01.510
the college stayed high during his tenure. For a 
guy over in the history department then, I and my

01:01.651 --> 01:07.882
colleagues thought geosciences got favorite 
treatment. We thought you all were living off the

01:07.962 --> 01:10.647
good land. We were. There's no question about 
that. I think that's true. I think we did get

01:15.587 --> 01:17.109
favored treatment. We didn't teach very many 
courses. We had a lot of research. Some of our

01:21.777 --> 01:23.860
faculty were very highly paid. I was not one of 
them. But I can understand why you felt that way in

01:26.244 --> 01:30.771
history. When you got here, the decision had 
already been made for women to be admitted, the

01:30.937 --> 01:43.234
Corps to be volunteer, racial integration, 
higher admission requirements, but we didn't yet

01:30.937 --> 01:43.234
have women's dormitories. Were there some female 
students in geophysics in your early years? Oh,

01:50.123 --> 01:51.365
there weren't. The first few years, there weren't 
any. As a matter of fact, there were a lot of core

01:53.929 --> 01:57.314
kids that were in the geophysics program. But 
shortly thereafter, after the first few years, we

01:57.835 --> 02:05.847
then got a big influx of female, women students. 
And they were amongst our best students, no

02:06.529 --> 02:10.174
question about it. I've always felt this was a bad 
way waste of a resource not to take the women and

02:11.977 --> 02:15.982
make them part of our society. Even today, we have 
these glass ceilings or whatever they are. Bad

02:22.410 --> 02:32.562
sets of criteria that they keep people who can do 
things from doing the things that they should do,

02:22.410 --> 02:32.562
make the contributions that they can make. Earl 
Rudder was president when you first got here. Do

02:37.708 --> 02:41.713
you remember any impressions you and your 
colleagues had of him? Yeah, he was a tough guy. But

02:45.256 --> 02:47.579
at the same time, he was a hard-working guy. He was 
really interested in A&M. He really wanted to make

02:50.102 --> 02:53.366
it into a first-class university. I think that was 
clear. I do remember one thing, though. I talked to

02:59.674 --> 03:06.283
him after one meeting, and I asked him, why don't 
you set up the faculty senate? I said, it would be to

03:06.263 --> 03:09.247
your advantage to have one. And he just gave me this 
one look which indicated, look it, buddy. The

03:13.953 --> 03:17.257
troops don't tell the generals what's going to 
happen around here. So he was sort of an

03:17.677 --> 03:20.421
authoritarian figure. Of course, all of A&M at 
that point was very authoritarian. It was not very

03:24.546 --> 03:26.368
democratic. I think we've gone a little too 
democratic. at this point to tell you the truth. I

03:31.376 --> 03:40.097
sort of have the feeling that we have the inmates 
running the asylum and we could use a little more of

03:31.376 --> 03:40.097
that tough leadership at the head. Do you remember 
President Rudder coming to speak to the

03:40.718 --> 03:45.349
geosciences faculty? No, I don't. He may have, but 
I don't remember. I don't remember many such

03:50.016 --> 03:55.426
college-level functions. Then when he died in 
1970, Jack Williams became the president. Do you

04:01.597 --> 04:03.861
have any recollections of him? It seemed like he 
did a pretty competent job. I did not interact very

04:07.045 --> 04:10.990
much with the president. I was busy here in the 
troops, on the front lines, dealing with students

04:11.211 --> 04:20.082
and the other faculty. And I've never gotten very 
interested in administration. I've never tried

04:23.827 --> 04:27.171
to get into administration. And of course, I never 
have, other than being acting head for a couple of

04:27.672 --> 04:34.000
years.

04:35.937 --> 04:39.310
Under Williams, they built some women's dorms. 
That was one of his conditions. Accepting the job

04:41.599 --> 04:44.952
was that he could designate a dorm in January of 71 
that would be for women, take an existing dorm. You

04:50.412 --> 04:56.618
don't remember any sudden change in women in 
geophysics, do you? Well, that's about when it

04:56.839 --> 04:59.061
happened, yes. It was in the early 70s. I could go, I 
got my grade book there, I could look and we could

05:00.642 --> 05:07.970
see what the males and the females are if you're 
really interested. Oh, now that reminds me of

05:09.572 --> 05:11.434
something. What was your What was your grading 
methodology? Did you grade on the curve, or on what

05:18.629 --> 05:22.853
basis did you assign grades? Yeah, I graded on a 
curve, essentially. But it was not an absolute

05:27.484 --> 05:31.468
curve. As a matter of fact, most of the exams that I 
gave were generally three or four questions with

05:31.869 --> 05:38.835
two or three parts to them. They were generally 
problem solving and writing type questions. They

05:46.122 --> 05:47.324
were not multiple choice. And so I couldn't do it on 
the grade by by the numbers sort of thing. Of

05:54.692 --> 05:57.196
course, but again, there were 15 kids in the class. 
And it really would have been unconscionable on my

05:57.416 --> 06:03.164
part to make a multiple choice test in the grade 
that way. So each exam was gone over with a fine

06:03.465 --> 06:07.310
tooth comb. Multiple partial credit was given to 
all the students. And I found, as a matter of fact, I

06:12.678 --> 06:16.363
even wrote a paper that with 10 students, you could 
easily get a Gaussian distribution. And it may be a

06:22.893 --> 06:29.369
distribution with one of the tails missing or 
something like that. Usually, the lower tail was

06:29.429 --> 06:33.238
generally missing. But you can tell. You know that 
there are really bright kids in the class, and they

06:35.182 --> 06:41.172
get to the top grade. And you look at how it starts to 
tail on off. If it tails off tremendously down to

06:44.198 --> 06:48.165
the last guy, well, then maybe he should flunk. But 
if it tails off not all that much on down to the last

06:48.445 --> 06:53.775
guy, well, obviously this kid has learned 
something. And I also had some absolute standards

06:53.755 --> 06:59.230
as to what I wanted the kids to learn from my course. 
So I looked to see if they had gotten that much

06:59.631 --> 07:03.723
information out of it. So I failed very few kids. 
But that's not surprising because, first of all,

07:08.757 --> 07:15.827
they were all seniors, mostly all seniors or 
juniors, the undergraduates, number one. And

07:16.167 --> 07:20.554
they were, in this group of kids, a really super 
bright number two. So I felt that if anybody really

07:20.914 --> 07:26.442
failed, it was my fault more than theirs. Looking 
back over 30 years, did you come to any general

07:27.443 --> 07:37.718
impression about which high schools produced 
some of the best students? No, not really. I don't

07:40.824 --> 07:42.786
think I ever really paid attention to that. So they 
were scattered in terms of background. Yeah,

07:45.991 --> 07:48.334
because we didn't have that many students. And 
it's not like we were getting a lot of students from

07:48.574 --> 07:52.559
Texas that we could look at it. And so therefore, we 
really paid attention to the SAT scores and the

07:52.900 --> 08:03.874
grade point averages and the letters of 
recommendation and not so much which school it

07:52.900 --> 08:03.874
was. But I do recall there were some schools that we 
felt more favorably inclined to. And I don't

08:10.582 --> 08:16.049
remember which ones they were, but there were some 
schools that had a better reputation. In those

08:17.030 --> 08:22.316
early years, you taught, you said, two or 
sometimes three courses. Right. What were those

08:23.077 --> 08:27.943
courses, and what was the general content of your 
normal workload? OK. The courses were

08:29.525 --> 08:33.810
exploration, seismology, which had a lab 
associated with it. And so it was three hours of

08:36.012 --> 08:39.416
lectures, three hours of- Junior? That was a 
senior level course. There was a junior level

08:42.139 --> 08:50.408
course which was experimental exploration 
geophysics, which also had a lab associated with

08:42.139 --> 08:50.408
it. It was three hours lecture and a four hour lab. 
And let's see, there was also, the other course was

08:54.052 --> 09:01.300
the physics of the Earth's interior. And I've also 
taught the geophysical data processing, which is

09:01.280 --> 09:12.690
how to manipulate the seismic data and digital 
data and handle stuff like that. Those are the

09:13.091 --> 09:14.492
undergraduate courses. But I also taught the 
graduate level courses in theoretical

09:14.712 --> 09:23.680
seismology, continuum mechanics, physics of the 
Earth's interior, a migration course. What were

09:24.341 --> 09:25.201
some of the others?

09:28.124 --> 09:29.245
I did a... Theoretical seismology, earthquake 
seismology. Yeah, the theoretical seismology. I

09:36.557 --> 09:39.525
never did do the gravity and magnetics at the 
graduate level. Dave Falk was always did that one.

09:42.132 --> 09:43.395
But those were the ones that I taught. And then, of 
course, the seminar courses. Who was the

09:47.467 --> 09:54.299
departmental student advisor in the late 60s and 
70s? I was the graduate advisor all that time. We

09:58.787 --> 09:59.828
only had one, of course. The undergraduate 
advisor, I believe, rotated. Rick Carlson did it

10:05.118 --> 10:12.488
for a while, but even before then, Dave Falkus was 
the one who seemed to spend most of the time at it. He

10:12.528 --> 10:15.011
was always very, very interested in the students. 
Of course, Terry Spencer also would advise the

10:15.412 --> 10:23.422
students, but only when there were problems the 
department had. Again, there weren't very many

10:24.283 --> 10:28.729
students, so there really wasn't a lot of work to 
do. As the graduate advisor, what were normally

10:28.709 --> 10:36.315
the topics that you needed to help them with? What 
were their problems? Yeah, the problem was they

10:38.767 --> 10:42.073
weren't as good as our own undergraduates. And 
what they really need was the math and the physics.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.746
Most of them had the geology, and they didn't have 
the math and the physics. And that was the one that

10:50.127 --> 10:53.794
we needed to get them into. We had a lot of them who 
spent the first year or so doing our undergraduate

10:53.814 --> 10:59.644
courses. actually, because they didn't have them 
as undergraduates. And they got credit at a time

11:04.657 --> 11:10.970
where you did a master's degree, you could get 
credit for undergraduate courses, and it was

11:04.657 --> 11:10.970
worthwhile. And the graduate students would 
object to being in those undergraduate courses

11:11.752 --> 11:20.029
because the undergraduates were so good, made it 
tough for them. You know, usually the undergrads

11:20.009 --> 11:25.779
complain that you've got graduate students in the 
courses, they're making it harder. Well, this was

11:26.059 --> 11:27.802
the other way around, actually. So our graduate 
students weren't as good as their

11:28.223 --> 11:30.727
undergraduates. But those were the courses. Now, 
surely you must remember some stories of some

11:32.350 --> 11:42.186
student offering some excuse that didn't make 
sense for a problem. There probably was a bunch of

11:43.651 --> 11:52.062
those stories, but those are the kind of things 
that I just kind of slough them off, you know, and I

11:43.651 --> 11:52.062
really don't think about them. I don't like to 
dwell on those things. I like to dwell more on the

11:54.325 --> 11:59.832
positive things rather than the, and I've never 
been a collector of stories. Bob Berger's one, and

12:00.693 --> 12:02.755
I know you are one. You're just tremendous at it, 
and I'm just not, I'm just not very interested, so I

12:02.795 --> 12:09.364
don't remember them well, unfortunately. Right. 
You describe your, beginning and your progress as

12:12.710 --> 12:15.775
a researcher here. What did you start working on 
and trace that along? Well, I started as a

12:21.123 --> 12:30.617
researcher when I was a graduate student at UCLA 
and did work in wave propagation primarily. Then

12:33.550 --> 12:38.837
when I went to Space General, I worked on antennas 
and communication systems. As a matter of fact, I

12:38.977 --> 12:50.571
did an analysis of what today is a GPS system 
because the satellites were just coming into use

12:38.977 --> 12:50.571
at that time. People were already thinking about 
using satellites for detecting locations on the

12:51.572 --> 12:56.157
ground. As a matter of fact, they had it the other 
way around. They had a system whereby uh a downed

13:00.331 --> 13:27.064
pilot would have a transmitter that transmitter 
would transmit up to the satellite the satellite

13:00.331 --> 13:27.064
would as it went on by would pick up the signal and 
then retransmit it to the thing there and on the

13:00.331 --> 13:27.064
basis of the time that it was received and so forth 
so they could pinpoint the guy so he asked me to do a

13:00.331 --> 13:27.064
calculation on that to see just how accurately 
they could pinpoint it and i remember i did a

13:00.331 --> 13:27.064
calculation that came out to be something like a 
tenth of a meter or something like that. I was

13:28.205 --> 13:29.587
really just fascinated. Of course, I failed to 
take into account some of the real serious

13:29.787 --> 13:40.738
problems, like effects of the atmosphere and 
noise and jitter in the oscillators and so forth.

13:40.858 --> 13:48.025
And then from there, when I went to MIT, I did 
electromagnetic wave propagation, underground

13:40.858 --> 13:48.025
communication. So I was in electrical parts. But 
then when I went to MIT, I could have continued with

13:49.506 --> 13:54.351
the electrical part. But Ted Madden was already 
there, and he was doing the electrical stuff.

13:57.776 --> 13:59.499
There was nobody doing the seismic. I had done the 
seismic before, so I did the seismic. So I did the

14:02.343 --> 14:03.665
seismic stuff. And of course, I had been doing a lot 
of data processing and communication theory

14:03.705 --> 14:10.435
stuff, and so I got into the data processing stuff 
as well. The laser strain meter was kind of an

14:10.836 --> 14:16.845
outshoot of my electronics and servo mechanism 
background and so forth. And then when I got here, I

14:16.825 --> 14:20.372
sort of did the same thing. I got more into data 
processing, into theoretical geophysics. I

14:25.100 --> 14:32.274
looked at the chemistry and physics of the Earth, 
phase changes and so forth, stuff like that. I've

14:34.398 --> 14:38.445
got maybe 60 publications. All of which are 
different. There has not been any one field that

14:41.952 --> 14:48.505
I've really spent my time in other than 
geophysics. Looking at that 60 some odd

14:50.789 --> 14:58.324
publications, which was the first one that really 
you were proud to claim? Actually, it was the

14:59.806 --> 15:01.789
second paper I did. It was with Leon Knopoff, an 
undergraduate student. It was on seismic

15:05.433 --> 15:07.536
reciprocity. And it's still referenced today. 
And as a matter of fact, I still write papers, and

15:10.420 --> 15:16.107
still people talk to me about that. And some people 
call me Mr. Reciprocity. But that was just one of

15:19.411 --> 15:21.814
the subjects. So that one had the biggest impact. 
There were a couple others that were pretty

15:24.157 --> 15:26.821
important. I did the self-focusing antenna 
arrays, servo mechanism. I did the communication

15:30.908 --> 15:35.877
system, the underground communications. And 
there's a bunch of other ones, too. I'm glad to tell

15:38.441 --> 15:39.583
you about them. All right, after you got here, 
which was the first one that you were proud to

15:39.603 --> 15:49.860
mention to your colleagues and so forth? Well, 
there's been a couple of them. The first one was

15:52.018 --> 15:58.668
looking at the moho as a solid-solid phase change. 
And making the assumption that the moho is a

15:59.109 --> 16:09.044
solid-solid phase change, the moho is down around 
30 kilometers or so below the surface of the Earth,

15:59.109 --> 16:09.044
is that there's a density change. And from that, 
one can get One could build mountains or make

16:11.288 --> 16:13.392
oceans. And so we did an analysis to show how this 
could go about. Unfortunately, nobody accepts

16:18.140 --> 16:23.269
that theory, believes that the Moho is a phase 
change. They think it's a chemical change. But

16:24.812 --> 16:27.417
that was one of the first ones that I thought that 
was really important. Another one I did was the

16:27.857 --> 16:33.347
non-linear least squares thing, which was really 
important in terms of the inverse theory of being

16:33.327 --> 16:45.326
able to extract parameters from data from 
nonlinear problems. Most people have solved

16:45.386 --> 16:48.250
linear problems in the past. I did the nonlinear 
one and looked at the case of creep and salt as a and

16:54.640 --> 16:57.463
did some work, and the creep and salt was applied. 
This nonlinear inverse theory was applied to

16:57.764 --> 17:01.708
creep and salt. So that's another one that is very 
important. Then one more recently, well, it's not

17:05.012 --> 17:10.718
so recent, 78 or so, is the bed of nails model. It's 
the model for the variation of velocity and

17:10.798 --> 17:16.405
permeability as a function of pressure. And 
nobody had done a good theoretical model before I

17:17.006 --> 17:23.533
did it, and I did it. People still don't use it as 
much as they should, but they will, I'm sure. So at

17:27.626 --> 17:33.826
first you worked in the atmosphere, but then you 
began to work underground. Right. Some of it

17:35.663 --> 17:36.985
applied. Well, it all was underground, actually, 
because the seismic wave propagation was also

17:37.145 --> 17:42.193
underground. But that was seismic. Then it went to 
the atmosphere. The ionosphere got involved in

17:46.058 --> 17:49.003
the electromagnetic propagation. But actually, 
that was propagation with the antennas in the

17:49.263 --> 17:52.228
ground. It was supposed to be communication 
between command posts and missile sites. But

17:57.195 --> 18:02.042
nevertheless, the communication actually went 
up to the ionosphere through the atmosphere. In

18:02.849 --> 18:09.662
those early years, did the department have any 
game plan? Were there some goals for the

18:09.742 --> 18:11.807
department? What did you all hope it would be? 
Well, we hoped that what we would do is develop some

18:14.852 --> 18:24.351
good students and develop a reputation so that we 
would have a national reputation.

18:25.883 --> 18:27.345
We developed a little bit of one. I think we 
certainly developed a good one in exploration

18:27.505 --> 18:31.250
geophysics. We never did develop a very good 
reputation in classical geophysics. We'd also

18:39.761 --> 18:45.008
built up a very good reputation in tectonophysics 
with the guys in the Center for Tectonophysics.

18:45.569 --> 18:54.000
But the plan, of course, was to have a good program, 
a quality program that would bring fame and

18:45.569 --> 18:54.000
fortune to all of us. What other institutions were 
kind of the model, hoping to be in the same league

18:54.352 --> 19:01.443
with whom? Well, of course, we would like to have 
been in the league of MIT, Caltech, UCLA,

19:02.504 --> 19:10.977
Columbia, Lamont-Doherty. Were there any 
regional schools that you all wanted to at least

19:11.243 --> 19:19.554
stay better than? Who were the regional 
competitors? Let's see. Actually, there weren't

19:24.320 --> 19:26.804
any. The University of Texas at that point had a 
very weak program in geophysics. Rice had a

19:32.572 --> 19:34.815
program. They had a pretty good, and some aspects 
of it were good. But it wasn't as strong a program as

19:38.560 --> 19:41.183
ours. If anything, the program that did develop 
for a while, and now has sort of gone down the drain,

19:41.163 --> 19:48.932
is one at the University of Houston. And then it 
sort of died back there. So yeah, we were always in

19:52.296 --> 19:57.582
competition with those regional programs. And of 
course, the University of Texas program has

19:57.602 --> 20:03.289
gotten much better in the recent past.

20:04.670 --> 20:11.002
Were there any opportunities that were missed in 
the early years for the department that you can

20:04.670 --> 20:11.002
think of? Yeah, I think there were a lot of missed 
opportunities.

20:21.241 --> 20:27.368
The department really would have been a lot better 
off if we had all worked together more.

20:29.109 --> 20:29.910
You mean as a team? As a team, yeah. Whereas it 
seemed like everybody was pulling their own way,

20:32.493 --> 20:36.918
their own direction. Of course, I was no help 
either. It's not like saying it's everybody

20:39.300 --> 20:42.043
else's fault but mine. But I think that if we had 
gotten together and cooperated more, it would

20:42.123 --> 20:51.113
have made it into a much better department. 
Spencer was the department head at first. How long

20:55.301 --> 20:56.423
did he serve? He served for about ten years. Who 
followed him? I was the acting head for two years.

21:03.996 --> 21:07.903
Describe what it was like to be the acting 
department head. It was great, really. Everybody

21:10.167 --> 21:16.078
said that it was going to be tough to be acting head 
and that I couldn't get along with people and so

21:10.167 --> 21:16.078
forth and so on. Actually, it turned out I had less 
problems when I was acting head than when I was not

21:16.459 --> 21:22.010
acting head. Because I guess I was always fighting 
the system. When I was acting head, I was the

21:25.596 --> 21:27.580
system. And I had my own ideas about how things 
should be done. And I usually had my way of doing

21:31.107 --> 21:33.893
things. And the way in which it was, I would say, 
this is the way we're going to do it. If you have any

21:39.104 --> 21:42.632
objections, tell me what your objections are and 
why. And if you don't have any objections, this is

21:42.832 --> 21:47.121
the way we're going to do it. So it worked out all 
right for a while there. We made some good

21:50.629 --> 21:52.292
progress. We hired some good people and got some 
good students and so forth. And then we got Neville

21:56.982 --> 21:59.849
Carter to come. He was the guy who... Describe him 
and his strengths. His strengths were his people

22:04.702 --> 22:08.109
strengths. He was a good guy for getting people 
involved and getting people to work together. And

22:12.377 --> 22:20.112
he set up the business of doing the five-year plan. 
kind of thing where we would have retreats and you

22:20.092 --> 22:45.255
say what are we going to do in the next five years and 
stuff like that and actually that was a very good

22:20.092 --> 22:45.255
idea and it it helped I'm sure because we did things 
we looked about which way the department wanted to

22:20.092 --> 22:45.255
go and who we were going to try to hire and how we were 
going to go get students and so forth and so on so so

22:20.092 --> 22:45.255
he's he was a Also, he was a very good researcher. He 
did some excellent research in salt, which was his

22:47.740 --> 22:54.171
main area of interest. He was department head, do 
you say, five years? Yeah, I think he was about five

22:57.657 --> 22:59.300
years. And then who follows him? I believe Errol 
Hoskins did. Describe him. Well, Earl was a very

23:05.418 --> 23:07.782
low-key guy. And so things were just kind of quiet, 
and they just sort of just went along. And

23:14.932 --> 23:20.280
actually, I think that was about the time when the 
oil business was getting in trouble anyway. And so

23:20.320 --> 23:30.255
there really wasn't much you could do except sort 
of pull your ears in and just hope that you could end

23:20.320 --> 23:30.255
up surviving. And we survived. How did the 
downturn in oil prices and so forth in the 80s, how

23:34.291 --> 23:40.626
did that affect the department? It affected the 
department quite a bit in the number of students

23:41.447 --> 23:46.659
that would come on in. The enrollment went down 
quite a bit. The quality of the students went down.

23:51.588 --> 23:54.772
quite a bit, both as a graduate and the 
undergraduate program. So it made a big

23:55.072 --> 23:56.935
difference. It didn't go down as badly as it might 
because we did have other strengths. We weren't

24:02.161 --> 24:08.068
just an oil company school, but that was one of our 
main areas. And so we were hurt by the oil industry.

24:10.692 --> 24:14.817
Did the contributions from the corporations go 
down also? Yes. So scholarships were harder to

24:15.878 --> 24:18.842
produce? Right. And the number of employment 
opportunities for the graduates went down. Yes,

24:25.220 --> 24:33.387
but it wasn't really too bad, because the way it was 
before is every one of our graduates would end up

24:25.220 --> 24:33.387
with five or six offers when they graduated. And so 
now they only had one or two. It would break my

24:35.790 --> 24:40.113
heart, because these were all good, high-quality 
companies. And I've always felt that the kids were

24:40.514 --> 24:46.059
better off if they didn't go to work for an oil 
company. If they did something different than

24:47.280 --> 24:55.227
that, they probably would have an even better, 
more interesting, and more profitable career.

24:55.207 --> 25:03.440
Because my father always told me, he says, Tony, 
the best way to be a poor man is to take a job that you

24:55.207 --> 25:03.440
like and to work at it. And that's, of course, what 
I've done. And I've ended up being a poor man

25:05.424 --> 25:07.767
because of that. In these 30 years, what have been 
the changes in where a geophysics graduate gets a

25:08.449 --> 25:17.383
job? I don't think there really have been any 
changes. There always was. The government was a

25:22.856 --> 25:25.361
strong place. Academia was a strong place. There 
are all the government labs, for example, and of

25:28.006 --> 25:35.862
course the oil industry, the resource industry. 
It's slowed down a little bit in terms of the

25:35.842 --> 25:41.390
resource industry, but it's still there. And all 
the other places are still there. But the other

25:44.053 --> 25:46.877
thing is we give them a good training. Kids get 
trained in the Earth. They know about the Earth.

25:50.742 --> 25:51.443
They know math. They know physics. They know 
logical thinking, problem solving. And we force

25:54.928 --> 26:00.255
them to take courses in English, history, 
political science, and all that. We've always

26:00.295 --> 26:04.701
felt that the student should be more than just a 
scientist. And so they come out with a tremendous

26:04.681 --> 26:07.345
education. I mean, hell, they could be a history 
major. What would they do then?

26:13.073 --> 26:21.726
So I've always felt that the kids had a good 
education if they're going into geophysics. I

26:21.786 --> 26:26.393
never felt worried about getting a job, that they 
could always get a job. And I used to tell them that a

26:26.413 --> 26:29.878
good guy person knows how to do something never has 
to worry about getting a job because there are so

26:30.398 --> 27:00.152
few people in the world that know how to do anything 
now the and the kind of job the salaries that they

26:30.398 --> 27:00.152
started out with yes would if we had constant 
buying power dollars would those salaries have

26:30.398 --> 27:00.152
kind of followed the price of oil per barrel um like 
salaries this year are better than they were in

27:00.419 --> 27:02.584
constant dollars four or five years ago? No, not 
really. I mean, there's so much profit and so much

27:06.172 --> 27:14.532
slop in the oil business that the price of the oil is 
really almost immaterial, I think. Of course, you

27:15.694 --> 27:17.278
get on down to it. There's a finding cost. 
developing costs and so forth for oil is somewhere

27:19.403 --> 27:45.192
maybe three four dollars a barrel and it's never 
and now you know in today's money and it's never

27:19.403 --> 27:45.192
been that that price in the last well there's 
certainly 20 years and before 30 years ago when it

27:19.403 --> 27:45.192
was down around three dollars a barrel why then the 
costs were about a dollar or something like that so

27:19.403 --> 27:45.192
so there's always been a lot of money in there so the 
The salaries that the kids get, I think, are more

27:45.172 --> 27:52.120
dependent upon the competition about other 
people who would hire them. It's not so much been

27:52.621 --> 28:00.710
the price of the oil, because whatever profits are 
available on these things here, that was taken by

27:52.621 --> 28:00.710
the executives. They would give bonuses and go to 
the shareholders. It never went to the workers.

28:10.602 --> 28:15.596
I don't think there ever was any real fluctuation 
in terms of that. There was a fluctuation in terms

28:15.857 --> 28:25.624
of the number of students that were hired, the 
number of positions that were available, but I

28:15.857 --> 28:25.624
don't think there was that much fluctuation in 
salaries. Did you all begin to attract

28:25.604 --> 28:28.389
international students? Yes. When? That's been 
the more recent past. Well, we always had

28:33.299 --> 28:37.527
international students in our graduate program, 
as a matter of fact. Primarily from what areas in

28:37.727 --> 28:39.731
the world? We had them initially from India and 
then from Taiwan. And I see that for a long time.

28:47.895 --> 28:48.436
That was it. And then Korea was another place where 
we had a strong number of excellent students that

28:48.496 --> 28:55.984
came on in, got their education here in the United 
States. It was at the time when we didn't have a big

28:56.465 --> 28:59.828
reputation. And so we had difficulty trying to 
attract high quality American students into the

29:00.669 --> 29:06.495
program. This is the graduate program again. And 
so we did have a lot of foreign students. More

29:10.660 --> 29:32.989
recently, however, the department

29:10.660 --> 29:32.989
does have a reputation, so we have guys coming from 
Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, from Indonesia, from

29:10.660 --> 29:32.989
Russia, China, all over the place, wherever 
there's We've had students from South America,

29:32.969 --> 29:38.077
Central America. And you all did not do any 
specific recruiting in those overseas areas, did

29:38.638 --> 29:46.930
you? No, no we did not. They came on their own? They 
came on their own, but as soon as they made an

29:49.574 --> 30:03.374
inquiry, well, we immediately started talking to 
them, and we didn't let any prospect get away, or at

29:49.574 --> 30:03.374
least we worked on them very assiduously. And you 
did not mention many European or other Western

30:04.476 --> 30:12.207
hemisphere. No, there weren't many. There were 
some who came to the Center for Tectonal Physics,

30:15.671 --> 30:28.588
because we had a gal from Italy and a couple from 
Germany that came to tectonal physics. But most of

30:28.868 --> 30:34.515
the ones that were in the petroleum business came 
from the Far East and South America. Did you and

30:34.495 --> 30:48.706
your colleagues ever form any general ideas about 
which areas produced the most diligent students,

30:34.495 --> 30:48.706
the brightest students, which international 
areas?

30:51.732 --> 30:53.837
Not in the USA. Well, actually, you know, most 
foreign students always work a lot harder. Okay. I

30:57.863 --> 31:02.630
think of the ones who haven't worked hard, there's 
been only one place. There's a kid from, let's see,

31:02.770 --> 31:07.137
from Thailand. I guess it's Thailand. It just 
couldn't seem, it may have been just that one

31:09.059 --> 31:13.446
individual. He just couldn't seem to get anything 
done. But most of the time, the graduate students

31:16.791 --> 31:21.478
have been very hard workers. Ah, yes.
