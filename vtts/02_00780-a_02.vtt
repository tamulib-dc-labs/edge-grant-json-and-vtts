WEBVTT

00:04.368 --> 00:29.616
We

00:04.368 --> 00:29.616
had begun on this campus to develop a more than 
casual interaction with the Corvette

00:04.368 --> 00:29.616
Corporation. They were routinely here trying to 
sell us a big computer. And through the flow of

00:35.387 --> 00:46.052
many, many pulled out people through the Martin 
family in Texas, they have learned about India.

00:48.378 --> 00:50.180
They were intrigued. Word had gotten back to the 
CDC. So I was invited

00:55.026 --> 01:14.290
to come up and meet Bill Morris, the author who 
described the Invit program, and visit their,

00:55.026 --> 01:14.290
what they call their BDC, Spitz Technologies. 
That meeting had been set up, and About the time

01:16.880 --> 01:37.799
Bart Henson

01:16.880 --> 01:37.799
came

01:16.880 --> 01:37.799
here as chancellor, I told

01:16.880 --> 01:37.799
him that I was the one that he got very interested 
in. At any rate, he went with me. And so he and I went

01:38.420 --> 01:40.742
out for him to see Bill Norris in Warfare and some of 
the top officers in Central Valley. And I

01:40.762 --> 01:44.545
described the Invincible to him. And all this 
related to our own the evolving research part,

01:46.715 --> 02:01.730
which I had co-chaired, or vice-chaired, the 
committee on the

01:46.715 --> 02:01.730
research part with Chancellor Hubert, who was 
then the chairman. But anyway,

02:01.750 --> 02:15.203
the MCC document was out, or coming out, and I got an 
advance copy of the announcement. because of

02:16.634 --> 02:43.145
having

02:16.634 --> 02:43.145
established

02:16.634 --> 02:43.145
that relationship

02:16.634 --> 02:43.145
with the man and the company that was the creator of 
the idea. We had agreed to host here on this campus

02:43.165 --> 02:45.848
the, probably the fourth, third or fourth or 
fifth, I forget the number, by any conference on

02:46.317 --> 02:53.464
university, industry, government, microwave 
products. It was a conference that the IEEE

02:53.485 --> 03:06.458
had initiated, one part of the IEEE had initiated, 
oh, six or eight, maybe now ten years ago. And I'd

03:06.478 --> 03:07.539
been involved in that. Indeed, I'd structured the 
first one of them. At the time, I was on the

03:10.943 --> 03:14.046
administrative committee of the the division of 
the IEEE that got us started. And we just turned out

03:22.076 --> 03:26.221
going to have it at Texas A&M. I guess that was last 
year, the year before last, whatever the year was

03:26.241 --> 03:32.149
that MCC was to come. Well, I'd ask Bill Norris, 
because I knew he was a pivotal player in the

03:32.169 --> 03:40.759
evolution of MCC. commit to having whoever was 
going to be president of MCC be the keynote speaker

03:43.658 --> 03:54.595
for our conference, our University of the 
Ministry of Government Michael O'Connor

03:43.658 --> 03:54.595
Symposium here. And he said he would. So before Bob 
Inman ever became president of MCC, he was

03:56.638 --> 04:05.852
committed unknowingly to come here to be the 
keynote speaker at our conference. Well, the MCC

04:06.743 --> 04:08.766
thing moved. They did all of their interviews.

04:16.517 --> 04:24.048
Mark White went to the Hyatt Hotel in Chicago 
repair. That was in March of 1983.

04:43.075 --> 04:52.691
Don Walker and Art Hanson met as the chancellors of 
the UT A&M system. I knew well of the need, thought

04:52.711 --> 05:04.311
for a while I was going to have to go because Art 
Hanson had a conflict. He was able to work that

05:04.331 --> 05:08.037
conflict out and go on. I remember all this weather 
well because I was hitting, supposedly, with my

05:09.451 --> 05:18.145
family on a spring break trip to Utah. I was asked on 
the day of the meeting to sit by the phone in the

05:18.918 --> 05:27.070
condo in case there were any technical questions 
that came up. I remember well sitting in the... You

05:27.911 --> 05:30.715
still have to go to Utah. Oh, yeah, but one day I 
missed the day of the meeting. I sat by the fire and

05:34.341 --> 05:43.134
watched the snow fall and waited to see if the phone 
rang in case there was any need. So that happened in

05:43.154 --> 05:48.722
March

05:43.154 --> 05:48.722
of 1983. Through that sequence of interviews, the 
MCC thing then narrowed down to four cities,

05:50.660 --> 06:02.582
one of which was Austin.

06:02.602 --> 06:07.892
The governor called the meeting one Sunday 
evening, probably.

06:23.752 --> 06:25.976
I look back at my calendar and get the date. But here 
in sometime last year, before MCC made their

06:26.056 --> 06:46.671
forced march, as Inman put it, through the four 
cities, which were, what, San Diego, Atlanta,

06:26.056 --> 06:46.671
Raleigh, Durham, North Carolina, and Austin, 
Texas.

06:52.338 --> 07:19.614
He picked by some mechanism, I'm not sure what, 
about 20 people to come over one Sunday evening to

06:52.338 --> 07:19.614
talk about the strategy of how we

06:52.338 --> 07:19.614
should

06:52.338 --> 07:19.614
get ready to compete. Some of the obvious reasons 
players that were there,

07:22.223 --> 07:28.731
at least for me. Henry Cisneros, whose 
presentation in Chicago had been better than

07:29.772 --> 07:40.324
anybody's, so stated by MCC. But they couldn't go 
to San Antonio because there wasn't a major

07:40.344 --> 07:45.690
university there that they could draw. And that 
was the only reason. Otherwise, San Antonio would

07:47.372 --> 07:51.437
have had it. I was there in R. Hanson's behalf. He 
had a conflict that he could not get out of, and so he

07:57.268 --> 08:05.204
asked me to go and represent the A&M system.

08:05.304 --> 08:10.194
Don Walker was there representing the UT system. 
He and I met, Walker and I met in his office about an

08:10.214 --> 08:14.843
hour beforehand. to explore how UT and A&M would 
cooperate in this venture, which was probably the

08:15.397 --> 08:24.746
first meeting of its kind in history. And an 
interesting meeting, and I've grown to be quite

08:25.406 --> 08:40.340
fond of Don Walker for no other reason than just 
based on that opportunity to begin to talk about

08:25.406 --> 08:40.340
how we'd work together. We really just said, you 
know, Gee, we'll just go in and tell them, UT and A&M

08:42.380 --> 08:48.871
are going to back this deal, whatever's required, 
and see how it goes. And I thought I might basically

08:48.891 --> 08:54.620
follow his lead, since it was in Austin. It was the 
city, not College Station.

09:01.351 --> 09:04.336
We'll now tie together the other piece of the story 
for me. Because as we met, we were only about three

09:04.437 --> 09:08.944
weeks away. I don't know, a short time away from 
this conference here in A&M. The brochures were

09:18.625 --> 09:34.392
printed, the speakers were there, and the 
announcement was Bobby Inman, president of MCC,

09:18.625 --> 09:34.392
keynote speaker. And I took several of those with 
me that night to distribute among the people that

09:36.177 --> 09:42.483
were there.

09:45.907 --> 09:56.658
Tease's role in attracting MCC became rather 
obvious to the people sitting in that room that

09:45.907 --> 09:56.658
night. None of them had any idea, first of all, that 
the conference was there. Secondly, that

10:01.002 --> 10:06.167
arrangements had already been made for the 
president of MCC, who had only been on board a very

10:06.569 --> 10:11.256
short period of time, was the keynote speaker. 
I've never told them how that was arranged, by the

10:11.276 --> 10:15.763
way. Not for any reason other than it's just never 
been the opportunity to tell them. But I always

10:23.474 --> 10:34.230
will remember the impact that had that evening 
when I passed out those

10:23.474 --> 10:34.230
brochures in the conference.

10:37.028 --> 10:51.470
As

10:37.028 --> 10:51.470
it turned out, on the personal side of the thing, 
part of the, that was personally satisfying, and

10:37.028 --> 10:51.470
that's why, and that's obvious that that would be. 
I was, at that time, again, on my way to Saudi

10:52.952 --> 10:59.222
Arabia. I had been asked by the University of 
Petroleum and Minerals and by Dr. Pickering, who

11:01.008 --> 11:18.932
was the previous director of the Department of 
Culture, who had spent two years building a

11:01.008 --> 11:18.932
research institute, not December, at the 
University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dairon. I

11:20.380 --> 11:31.513
had been asked to join Dr. Pickering in spending 
two weeks there reviewing the research program of

11:20.380 --> 11:31.513
this research institute and was on my way the next 
week.

11:35.117 --> 11:46.810
At the same time frame the advanced scout team of 
MCC was to come to Texas and we were planning that

11:35.117 --> 11:46.810
evening what and who they should see. already 
rescheduled this trip to Saudi Arabia once, maybe

11:46.958 --> 11:52.788
twice, I'm not sure. And I said to the governor that 
evening, I said, well, you know, if we decide that I

11:52.808 --> 12:13.101
personally need to be

11:52.808 --> 12:13.101
present for that visit, then clearly, obviously, 
the project has to go home, rescheduled, or just

11:52.808 --> 12:13.101
canceled. Perot, Ross Perot, said, well, look, 
couldn't you just go by and meet Bobby? I said, I

12:17.623 --> 12:19.727
still haven't met him.

12:22.894 --> 12:27.263
He said, could you swing by Washington on your way 
to study? And meet him.

12:30.810 --> 12:32.454
Just leave a day early. Because I was flying out of 
New York anyway. I said, yes, I can meet him. I would

12:37.381 --> 13:02.713
not be concerned

12:37.381 --> 13:02.713
about having to be there unless we

12:37.381 --> 13:02.713
just felt like an administrative or political 
business or whatever. Ross Perot's request or

13:05.022 --> 13:17.726
suggestion or demand or whatever Ross does, that I 
go on the way to Saudi and meet him. So I didn't. So I

13:20.251 --> 13:24.499
just left here a day early, flew into D.C. met with 
Perot, I mean, met with him over in Arlington,

13:25.458 --> 13:37.156
Virginia for, well, less than a half an hour. And I 
asked him if he had any questions he wanted to ask

13:37.176 --> 13:45.169
about Texas and why NCC was going to come. And he 
grinned

13:45.189 --> 13:50.698
and said, no, not really. He, uh,

13:55.478 --> 13:57.180
He had his scout team out. He wasn't playing it as he 
should have. He said, is there anything that you

14:00.705 --> 14:02.687
want to tell me? And I said, well, Texas is where you 
need to be. And if you should make the mistake of not

14:10.036 --> 14:17.946
locating physically in Texas, you're still going 
to find yourself deep in Texas. Because we've got,

14:19.848 --> 14:25.215
in our Institute for Solid State Electronics, the 
talent and the research capability that you're

14:26.393 --> 14:30.299
going to have to access sooner or later.

14:33.124 --> 14:46.125
And he said, OK.

14:33.124 --> 14:46.125
And then I gave him a copy of

14:33.124 --> 14:46.125
the conference brochure where he was going to 
speak. He didn't know that already. Yeah, he

14:47.527 --> 14:48.729
didn't know that already. He said, yes, I have that 
on my calendar. And I said, well, I thought you

14:50.352 --> 14:53.076
might like to have a copy of this. It's probably in 
the mail to you right now, but I left him with a

14:53.815 --> 15:02.985
couple more and

14:53.815 --> 15:02.985
thanked him for accepting so graciously to do it. 
And I told him we were excited about him coming

15:03.906 --> 15:07.109
down. We had a nice, brief, but to the point visit. 
He left to go testify to some Senate hearing

15:11.053 --> 15:17.460
committee, and I left to go to Saudi Arabia. I 
extended to him at the time, probably when he came

15:18.031 --> 15:25.644
we'd have a little dinner for him. We got together 
and I'd introduce him to some of these key players

15:25.664 --> 15:33.857
in this microelectronics business. And then he 
would meet many of them at the conference from all

15:33.877 --> 15:40.208
over the country. If he came in the night before the 
conference that we hosted in the house and invited

15:41.217 --> 16:07.242
some key researchers, the doers, the brains, the 
hat dogs, so that he could meet them in Portland,

15:41.217 --> 16:07.242
which I did.

16:10.715 --> 16:25.854
But I believe that conference actually occurred 
after the decision

16:10.715 --> 16:25.854
was made for them to come to Texas.

16:25.874 --> 16:26.855
Because they moved on that decision very quickly. 
But we hosted in the Batch Scout team a number of MCC

16:26.875 --> 16:36.246
people here on campus. They visited our solid 
state institute. Our larger MicroLocunt

16:39.773 --> 16:55.918
program, which has now grown in the EE division of 
TEAS to be run as a substitute interaction, we now

16:39.773 --> 16:55.918
have had, as you're probably aware, a design 
program linked with Texas Instruments that's now

16:39.773 --> 16:55.918
four years old. All of that was up and running. 
Again, we weren't talking about what we were

16:57.400 --> 17:00.565
getting ready to do. We were showing examples of 
product designs that have been reduced to

17:00.625 --> 17:08.076
practice. the

17:08.748 --> 17:28.574
students that were coming out the door. I think it 
played a measurable role in the university. And

17:29.695 --> 17:30.476
so, the governor thought something. I read the 
article in the paper where he cited the groups that

17:30.496 --> 17:33.540
he's been close to and just gave the credit to the 
team, and he didn't give it to anyone. Well, I got a

17:34.448 --> 17:49.908
lot of calls from Houston

17:34.448 --> 17:49.908
alumni when that article hit about, hey, you can't 
let them get away with this, because otherwise it

17:34.448 --> 17:49.908
will become history. So it was, I thought, very 
appropriate what the governor had to say. Was that

17:59.407 --> 18:09.124
said at the end, after you contacted him, or was 
this something that... You wouldn't think I wrote

17:59.407 --> 18:09.124
what you got, I have to say. It sounded like you'd 
gotten on the phone and said, hey, you know. As a

18:13.692 --> 18:17.198
matter of fact, we did.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.145
Of course, he wouldn't have put it out again. No 
way. Now, he had to say it. Well, as I said, UT and

18:25.776 --> 18:30.401
Texas A&M cooperating on something. I think this 
was the big spark. It was the first, and we knocked

18:32.744 --> 18:35.006
it out of the park. Absolutely. You can't quarrel 
with the success of what impression it made on MCC

18:39.231 --> 18:46.879
as an industry. And that these two major 
university systems were prepared to work

18:47.399 --> 18:58.469
together to get them to company. Otherwise it 
would have been bloody. As is normal. How do you

19:03.834 --> 19:17.187
administratively go about doing

19:03.834 --> 19:17.187
away with a particular area of research that has 
become frivolous? Well,

19:18.500 --> 19:40.345
every idea, every product, every person

19:18.500 --> 19:40.345
has a life, a predictable life. Some live longer 
than others. But the signs that it's over here, are

19:46.563 --> 19:52.051
usually

19:46.563 --> 19:52.051
pretty obvious. If we have a research division 
whose time has come to be terminated, the first

19:52.071 --> 20:11.858
sign of that is that nobody wants to support the 
research

19:52.071 --> 20:11.858
division. Another sign of it is that

20:17.174 --> 20:35.081
Even if resources are available,

20:17.174 --> 20:35.081
that is what I call seed dollars or T's, typically 
the kind of money you put in when you're creating to

20:17.174 --> 20:35.081
do with the seed if it makes sense. You measure it 
pretty much the same way you do in the beginning.

20:41.010 --> 20:44.515
You've got an idea of an area that you feel is 
important and should go, so you put some money in.

20:49.182 --> 20:58.253
And you support that concept by bringing in the 
right people, by building the right facilities,

20:49.182 --> 20:58.253
by buying the right equipment. And you nurture 
them. And then you see if they grow and they're

20:59.995 --> 21:01.857
healthy. And if they do, they bloom into something 
meaningful. And that's measured by their peers,

21:06.463 --> 21:14.232
not only at their own institution, but throughout 
the world. by how well their work is received in

21:14.870 --> 21:28.694
their own profession, their professional 
societies and professional journals. And it's

21:28.775 --> 21:39.173
measured by their ability to compete with their 
peers.

21:39.524 --> 21:41.768
And they're all in that entity. You're sticking 
with your question. How do you decide when it's

21:43.691 --> 21:51.984
time for an entity or a division or an area to 
terminate? Well, the analogy I'm trying to draw is

21:52.004 --> 22:02.802
the same way, you know, if a baby's born and you 
nourish it, you coddle it, and it dies,

21:52.004 --> 22:02.802
something's wrong with it. It didn't grow into a 
healthy being. that could defend itself, that

22:05.360 --> 22:24.007
could take care of itself, that could get kicked 
out of the nest, could go to college by itself,

22:05.360 --> 22:24.007
could learn on its own, could wash its own clothes, 
could compete with his peers for a valedictorian

22:05.360 --> 22:24.007
spot or the best job or position or what he wanted to 
do. If you'll let me personify a little bit, the

22:25.550 --> 22:32.059
entity itself functions the same way. If you put 
$50,000 into a microelectronics idea in 1968 and

22:32.579 --> 22:50.296
it isn't ready to play on the team at the national 
level of bringing MCC to Texas,

22:32.579 --> 22:50.296
we probably would have never been there in the 
first place. I'd say that one worked. But we put

22:53.459 --> 23:02.248
money into ideas before that didn't catch.

23:05.722 --> 23:09.507
urban affairs.

23:09.527 --> 23:27.192
We moved it, transferred it, you know, took it off 
the symbol act, put it on goat's milk, took it off

23:09.527 --> 23:27.192
the goat's milk, put it on the, you know, tried it in 
this environment, in that environment, gee, it

23:09.527 --> 23:27.192
looked like it was doing good for a while, and oops, 
you know, went pale again. We're running an

23:29.054 --> 23:34.041
experiment right now, a dramatic experiment, and 
that's in me. No idea how that's going to work.

23:38.804 --> 23:47.157
We're nurturing it, feeding it, coddling it, 
exposing it to this, that, and the other. But it's

23:47.177 --> 23:51.985
got to grow up and stand on its own

23:47.177 --> 23:51.985
feet. Well, if an entity that's been healthy, been 
working, been doing those things that are clear

24:03.232 --> 24:11.400
and obvious signs of health, of being meaningful 
and contributing to it. If it begins to get sick by

24:12.080 --> 24:29.057
whatever symptoms you use to measure, and you use 
all of those, then you analyze if

24:12.080 --> 24:29.057
administratively, has the administration 
gotten in the way? Kind of come back to your other

24:29.137 --> 24:30.738
question. Have you done something stupid? that's 
caused a problem, or has the technology matured

24:33.151 --> 24:54.701
that it represented to a point that the need for 
further research and development

24:33.151 --> 24:54.701
is just no longer there? That's recently happened 
in the remote cities. You redefined that. That's

25:01.740 --> 25:02.541
right. But see, NASA, when John Rouse took over the 
remote sensing, remote sensing as a technology

25:02.561 --> 25:20.378
application in space,

25:02.561 --> 25:20.378
defining what it would do, how it would do it, was at 
its infancy. Now, routine. Launch them, let them

25:24.282 --> 25:25.763
read. We lost the NASA support. Not because we 
weren't any good anymore, but because they had

25:30.560 --> 25:37.207
what they

25:30.560 --> 25:37.207
needed. And so we've turned a corner. That's 
natural. It's change. But you have to, the

25:41.592 --> 25:49.381
greatest mistake the administration has made, I 
think, is not to be willing to do it. Not to want to do

25:49.401 --> 25:51.483
it. Not to treat it as progress, as natural. But 
want the status quo, want to preserve what you know

25:57.020 --> 26:02.247
how to do. It's traumatic. It's traumatic on 
people's lives. It's traumatic, you know, I've

26:05.132 --> 26:09.518
got to reprint a new brochure and take the damn 
thing out of there. There are a lot of traumatic

26:09.538 --> 26:12.482
things about making change. So if you're not 
willing to deal with that or don't want to deal with

26:12.502 --> 26:20.734
that or don't want to be bothered with that, that's 
when I think the administrative structure gets in

26:12.502 --> 26:20.734
the way. Not when you go in and you say to the head of 
one of those divisions, It's not performing well.

26:27.115 --> 26:28.757
Hey, your division's not performing very well. 
What's wrong? Do you need some help? Are we in the

26:32.780 --> 26:33.641
way? Is it the administration's fault? Or have you 
got a problem with what you're doing and the need

26:37.445 --> 26:41.649
for it? Do you need to reassess where you're going 
and how you're going to get there? I think the

26:48.595 --> 26:53.740
administration's responsibility, I feel my 
responsibility as a director is just to answer the

26:48.595 --> 26:53.740
questions.

26:56.639 --> 27:21.673
And if I find somebody that doesn't want to answer 
them, demand that they be answered and come down

26:56.639 --> 27:21.673
hard enough with whatever I've got to come down

26:56.639 --> 27:21.673
with to be sure that we, together, then come to an 
agreement and an understanding of what we're

26:56.639 --> 27:21.673
doing and what it's costing to do and is it worth the 
cost. Now, TEAS tries to make all the research

27:21.693 --> 27:25.819
divisions pay. Besides seed money? Yeah, 
typically, indeed this year, I just got this

27:28.877 --> 27:42.068
letter back yesterday from the Governor's Budget 
Office and the Legislative Budget Office

27:28.877 --> 27:42.068
approving the new format. Which I think makes a lot 
of sense and makes it easier to explain it to the

27:42.088 --> 27:52.537
average layman, which is what you deal with in the

27:42.088 --> 27:52.537
political process. Why is TEAS existing and why do 
the taxpayers Why should the taxpayer pay? Why

27:57.901 --> 28:00.845
should we be taxed off? Essentially, I'm trying to 
break it down in an evolutionary cycle in three

28:02.306 --> 28:07.092
stages. And that's the startup program. And Ben is 
a good example. And in a startup program, that

28:12.979 --> 28:22.570
program, we have to be, we ETs, we the taxpayers, 
prepared to pay 100% of the cost.

28:27.663 --> 28:48.675
And what I want to be able to do is to say clearly to 
the legislature, that is, that entity that

28:27.663 --> 28:48.675
represents the clerk checking groceries out 
there, throwing some of her cash or his cash into

28:27.663 --> 28:48.675
the coffers, that here's why I believe this 
program makes sense. is going to help our society

28:49.769 --> 28:55.074
as a whole in Texas by doing this. And we need to be 
prepared collectively to put our money into debt

28:55.094 --> 29:01.820
servicing. And that's a startup

29:01.840 --> 29:05.983
program. Depending upon the complexity of that 
program, the market it serves, its objectives,

29:06.003 --> 29:19.135
on the average, I would say, a startup program 
would evolve a developing

29:19.520 --> 29:49.105
in about three years at which point if it's 
catching on if it's really working or beginning to

29:19.520 --> 29:49.105
work like we felt it would it will be returning it 
will be earning dollar for dollar

29:19.520 --> 29:49.105
and then when it matures or becomes established,

29:50.958 --> 30:06.683
it will bring in to the state $4 for every $1 we pay 
for an annual basis. That is, you'll get a 400% per

30:06.703 --> 30:15.797
annum return.

30:15.817 --> 30:17.540
That's on the average. Hence, to answer your 
question, On the average, TEAS sets as a target for

30:21.333 --> 30:44.806
an established, mature, meaningful program that 
it should generate 80%

30:21.333 --> 30:44.806
of its budget. We do have programs that do it. Sure. 
And I have programs that For every dollar we put in,

30:49.177 --> 31:02.159
it ran

30:49.177 --> 31:02.159
30 times.

31:02.840 --> 31:09.431
But it's

31:02.840 --> 31:09.431
more of a service to the system. That's right. We 
don't even treat those divisions of kids like

31:13.460 --> 31:23.110
that, because a service division is created

31:13.460 --> 31:23.110
for that purpose. And if a service division can

31:24.191 --> 31:36.204
break even, you deal with it. And the service 
divisions include the DPC and the Nuclear Science

31:36.224 --> 31:40.329
Center? DPC, Nuclear Science Center, and the 
Injury Counseling. That's really a

31:42.788 --> 31:52.419
high-precision

31:42.788 --> 31:52.419
model. The DPC, of course, is no longer

31:52.439 --> 32:01.670
quarantined. We did it September. We moved it to 
the university. There's a nuclear science center

32:06.335 --> 32:07.496
still. The nuclear science center functions 
under the division, the service division of the

32:08.077 --> 32:09.859
DPC. Although at the request of the head of the 
Nuclear Engineering Division two years ago,

32:10.767 --> 32:37.062
maybe

32:10.767 --> 32:37.062
three, the desire to integrate the Nuclear 
Science Center more into the research program of

32:10.767 --> 32:37.062
the Nuclear Engineering Division, we have the 
Nuclear Science Center reporting to this office

32:10.767 --> 32:37.062
through the Nuclear Engineering Division.

32:40.383 --> 32:41.284
That's right. Well, it's a controlling your own 
destiny thing. It's not a service center that they

32:44.787 --> 32:50.793
don't feel like they have as much control over. And 
in my mind, it makes sense. But then that puts a lot

32:52.996 --> 33:10.373
of pressure on the nuclear engineer to be sure that 
the nuclear reactor does indeed do

32:52.996 --> 33:10.373
the research that it would like to have it for and 
that it participates more in as a research program

32:52.996 --> 33:10.373
than a service center. and generates the 
meaningful, valuable results

33:10.724 --> 33:32.252
to the citizens

33:10.724 --> 33:32.252
of this state to justify the cause they're 
operating in. You said the data processing center

33:32.272 --> 33:34.576
transferred in September. Is that this year or 
next year? Does it come in September? No, it was

33:35.777 --> 33:36.478
patched up in September. Besides the 
dissemination

33:37.353 --> 34:01.562
of information and PR that Benson and others told 
you to prosecute

33:37.353 --> 34:01.562
in Canada, are there any other clues they gave to 
you as to what

33:37.353 --> 34:01.562
areas they felt please them to do that? Well, that 
was the key hurdle from Fred Benson. Others,

34:06.513 --> 34:31.828
if you read our Target 2000 study, which kind of 
followed

34:06.513 --> 34:31.828
the Texas study, the citizens of this state were 
asked to come in and review the purpose, goals,

34:06.513 --> 34:31.828
and objectives of the NU system. and taking 
advantage of the opportunities they have to serve

34:33.412 --> 34:43.805
the needs of Texas. To get a greater presence in the

34:43.825 --> 34:58.002
metropolitan area would be one of the challenges 
and objectives set forth for Texas. Or to create a

34:58.022 --> 35:01.967
presence in the area where the people are to make it 
easier to access the capabilities. That's one of

35:11.233 --> 35:20.661
the directives

35:11.233 --> 35:20.661
that's come forward. One of the ones I sent for this 
agency that I felt strongly about coming into this

35:20.921 --> 35:31.870
office and still do is the International.

35:34.668 --> 35:59.197
I

35:34.668 --> 35:59.197
believe that, particularly with our neighbors, 
Mexico and Canada, but not limited to Canada. The

35:59.217 --> 35:59.918
world isn't what it used to be. It's a small place. 
Is this something you held before Vanderbilt came

36:00.338 --> 36:01.880
out as a global university? Oh, sure. That's where 
I was going to China in 1979, Russia in 1977, Saudi

36:02.100 --> 36:03.742
Arabia last year. So you were very connected to the 
sky. He coincided rather well. He was having my

36:07.473 --> 36:12.221
teeth. And we worked pretty hard at that. We don't

36:16.409 --> 36:22.360
have any MCC examples. We

36:22.728 --> 36:44.601
have some satisfying experiences, but nothing 
that needs to happen. When Tease first started, he

36:47.078 --> 36:56.911
had a large education role in the Education

36:47.078 --> 36:56.911
Act. How has that changed since

36:56.931 --> 37:09.187
you've been here, or has it changed? I think it's 
increased. The role Tease plays by encouraging

37:12.205 --> 37:20.999
and supporting the church and its ability to do 
that. And probably with my willingness,

37:21.079 --> 37:32.037
one of the, what you would call radical movements 
in the current, since I've been the director and

37:21.079 --> 37:32.037
I'm the vice-director, as they say, is

37:32.270 --> 37:56.900
that TEAS has had new interdisciplinary 
divisions open up, interacting

37:32.270 --> 37:56.900
with the College of Business, Global Arms, GSN, 
and Education. First of all, it scared the College

37:56.920 --> 37:59.323
of Engineering to death, because they saw, or 
thought they saw, resources going out. Now

37:59.860 --> 38:22.037
this

37:59.860 --> 38:22.037
is all perception. But very accurate perception. 
Oh, I guess all this is actually documented.

38:29.138 --> 38:37.750
for a lot of very real

38:29.138 --> 38:37.750
and good reasons. From an administrative and 
financial standpoint, because of state laws,

38:37.770 --> 38:46.823
state funding,

38:37.770 --> 38:46.823
etc. But it was a difficult decision for

38:46.843 --> 38:53.973
the university to make. And I was not prepared to 
make that decision unilaterally. In all of those

39:00.998 --> 39:19.398
decisions,

39:00.998 --> 39:19.398
the deans of those colleges came to me with a 
request to create a tax revision. I asked for

39:19.418 --> 39:26.466
proposals of why they thought it made sense, other 
than we might

39:19.418 --> 39:26.466
have some resources in the faculty, and discussed 
at length with them. how we would do, what role the

39:27.290 --> 39:42.689
technology and engineering represents would 
play in the research and in the disciplines that

39:27.290 --> 39:42.689
they represent. And why they felt this 
integration, this interdisciplinary

39:42.709 --> 39:49.037
approach, would be valuable. I had my own opinions 
from day one, which were pro that approach that

39:49.057 --> 39:56.166
caused me to listen to them. But once I got all of 
that

39:56.821 --> 40:13.787
in front of them,

39:56.821 --> 40:13.787
and all of this didn't happen at once, it came in 
stages. The first one we moved to was the College

40:13.807 --> 40:21.138
of Business, and it would have been started 
because of income. One of the small movements of

40:21.158 --> 40:22.019
our business. But at that time, the College of 
Business didn't have no insurance. Zero. That

40:24.824 --> 40:25.765
Texas A&M University never had no service.

40:29.457 --> 40:52.771
We

40:29.457 --> 40:52.771
created a division of business and technology 
three years ago now. That's different from the

40:52.791 --> 40:55.735
industrial development division that was part of 
the strategic division. Yeah, that's that urban

40:56.002 --> 40:58.685
affairs thing I told you about. I moved that deal 
around, you know, finally into the business

40:58.705 --> 41:04.611
technology division. It's been absorbed in that. 
That kind of research, and that's the work long.

41:10.117 --> 41:11.318
Like, I never figured it out. You'll see, it was one 
of the first major teams. Yeah, outside of your

41:16.463 --> 41:19.927
classical engineering. Yeah, right. And it was, 
you know, thriving. That's right. That's right.

41:26.579 --> 41:30.522
And the urban need, you see, was there. And then the 
deal fell off. And it was very difficult to figure

41:34.206 --> 41:37.368
out what to do with it. And then it went into 
strategic technology. But the Center for

41:39.731 --> 41:55.084
Strategic Technology has evolved primarily into 
the strategic military-related technology,

41:39.731 --> 41:55.084
political technologies of the world, not the 
strategic sewer and prime and urban planning

41:39.731 --> 41:55.084
technology of cities. which the business people 
really have a talent for doing. They can draw in an

41:59.120 --> 42:19.638
interdisciplinary way the civil engineers and 
sanitary engineers, environmental engineers,

41:59.120 --> 42:19.638
those kinds of impacts that studies of strategic 
technologies of the urban community or the

41:59.120 --> 42:19.638
industrial development might need. So those have 
merged now? Those are all merged and that focus of

42:20.959 --> 42:25.543
the search happens in the

42:25.810 --> 42:34.780
business technology.

42:34.800 --> 42:54.482
How have different state,

42:34.800 --> 42:54.482
national, or international

42:34.800 --> 42:54.482
events affected communities in terms of massive 
amounts of funding, cutbacks in funding,

42:34.800 --> 42:54.482
particular types of programs? Oh, that's ongoing 
all the time. Constantly. And It's because that

42:56.455 --> 43:03.425
you have to realize that that's always there, 
particularly in the research business. Above all

43:03.445 --> 43:18.107
other businesses, the research, whatever you 
want to call it, business, game, process,

43:03.445 --> 43:18.107
research is by its own nature very dynamic. Yet 
when you...

43:29.277 --> 43:38.310
Its value to society is measured by society in 
different ways. And the ability to do it is

43:38.330 --> 43:47.964
determined by society's overall quality.

43:50.829 --> 43:53.192
The first thing that disappears in a hard time

43:57.037 --> 44:00.362
human

43:57.037 --> 44:00.362
nature. The first thing that you do away with in 
your personal life when you have to go into a budget

44:00.382 --> 44:12.881
squeeze for whatever reason caused it, is what you 
would otherwise define as the luxury zone. You may

44:12.901 --> 44:19.931
defer buying a new car, drive the old, long car, 
whatever. Research

44:19.951 --> 44:25.980
is the feedback, really.

44:29.386 --> 44:30.688
in the productivity cycle. That is, it lives off of 
the profits of society. You can model all of the

44:38.318 --> 44:43.685
whole world as just an industry.

44:43.705 --> 44:56.502
If it doesn't have the leisure time, if it hasn't 
managed itself in a productive way, then there

44:43.705 --> 44:56.502
just might not be time to think. And hence how 
you're going to lose But

44:59.727 --> 45:22.441
if an industry doesn't produce enough resources 
to pay through its manufacturing process and its

44:59.727 --> 45:22.441
sales and marketing, its production, you won't 
have any resources to create your research

44:59.727 --> 45:22.441
division. And you don't do research in 
production.

45:28.448 --> 45:32.095
So these economic cycles that you're referring to 
occur.

45:35.321 --> 45:39.850
Some, from the philosophy, have a change of 
administration. They don't

45:39.870 --> 45:44.599
like that kind of thing. But they like this kind of 
thing. Reagan comes in and we need more defense, so

45:46.142 --> 45:50.170
the DOD's budget comes in.
