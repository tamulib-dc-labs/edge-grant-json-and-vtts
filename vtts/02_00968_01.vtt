WEBVTT

00:01.364 --> 00:03.566
in a normal tone. Where are you going to place that? 
Let's put it right here.

00:09.973 --> 00:10.914
That way I can watch it. Well, some say you have a low 
voice and that you're God's gift to the radio

00:11.755 --> 00:22.325
kingdom, but I don't know if it's going to sound 
that way when we play this tape back. So what do you

00:22.345 --> 00:24.608
think about that? Well, all we care about is that we 
can be heard, right? So if you can type this away, we

00:29.478 --> 00:33.284
won't have any screw-ups.

00:38.632 --> 00:39.132
We set? Let's see, we're recording on 20 March 
1986, sitting in the living room up on Summit

00:41.816 --> 00:55.697
Avenue, and Chuck is about to ask me some 
penetrating questions. That's right. So why

00:57.389 --> 00:59.792
don't you first tell us a little bit about 
yourself? That was Chuck. Hi, squeaky voice.

01:05.438 --> 01:06.720
I'm God's gift to women. That's for certain, boys. 
What would you like to know? The background? A

01:12.887 --> 01:19.494
quick biographical background, and then your 
time in Nam, what you spent and what you did. OK.

01:19.834 --> 01:26.502
Well, I was born on January 8, 1946, on a log cabin in 
southern Minnesota. And I was drafted on October

01:27.730 --> 01:34.940
3, 1968. I

01:35.742 --> 01:42.431
went on down to basic training at Fort Campbell, 
Kentucky. And about the first week in December, we

01:44.694 --> 01:50.022
flew over. We graduated. Our basic training 
company graduated. And we flew on over to Fort

01:53.327 --> 01:56.151
Lewis, Washington. and did AIT, which is advanced 
infantry training, in the snow at Fort Lewis in

01:56.637 --> 02:03.264
preparation of going to the jungles of Vietnam. 
That concluded the end of February. I then had a

02:07.969 --> 02:16.538
short leave and went to the non-commissioned 
officer's candidate school at the infantry

02:07.969 --> 02:16.538
school at Fort Benning, Georgia. Graduated from 
there at the end of June Then drove back to Fort

02:24.650 --> 02:32.141
Lewis, Washington where I was platoon sergeant 
for a platoon of AIT infantry cadets. And then I had

02:33.423 --> 02:47.584
a three week leave and arrived in Nam at the end of

02:33.423 --> 02:47.584
sometime in September, early September. And I was 
assigned to the 25th Infantry Division. Spent a

02:51.667 --> 02:54.370
couple of days at Koo Chee in processing.

02:58.854 --> 02:59.715
Infantry Division. And we were called the 
Wolfhounds. And our area of operation was

03:03.579 --> 03:09.465
adjacent to the Cambodian border, northwest of 
Saigon.

03:13.890 --> 03:17.394
So, going into NAMM, why, what was your purpose? 
Why did you think you were going? What was your job

03:18.835 --> 03:20.577
to be accomplished? My feeling was that my father 
was a World War I Marine and a World War II Army

03:21.890 --> 03:34.315
officer, and an extremely patriotic and fair sort 
of person. And the prevailing political belief in

03:35.517 --> 03:40.928
our community, in our farming community, was that 
The military leaders and the political leaders

03:42.089 --> 03:57.615
were sending us over there because of the Red 
Menace and that it was necessary to combat

03:42.089 --> 03:57.615
communism, monolithic communism, over there 
before it got to our shores. And now when did you

03:59.418 --> 04:01.923
leave Vietnam? Left Vietnam on July 10th, 1970. 
And how were you greeted at home upon your arrival?

04:08.296 --> 04:09.237
Not very warmly. I was called a baby killer shortly 
after getting into California. And people didn't

04:16.544 --> 04:20.128
seem to care.

04:23.291 --> 04:24.952
Other vets would talk to you. And it was a big 
camaraderie. And it was like we were an exclusive

04:26.954 --> 04:34.101
union of people who the rest of society didn't 
quite know what to think of us. Well, what was your

04:34.435 --> 04:38.200
feeling to the war that was going on then while you 
were in the States then? Yeah, as I came back. Yeah,

04:40.123 --> 04:43.528
from when you first arrived, how did your attitude 
change, if indeed it had? Within about three weeks

04:43.768 --> 04:48.295
of getting into country, two to three weeks, my 
attitude began to change. I thought that we were

04:48.876 --> 04:56.066
saving these people, we were, you know, over 
there, liberators, helping them, that they were

04:48.876 --> 04:56.066
welcoming us with open arms. When I got out into the 
countryside and we got into areas that supposedly

04:56.907 --> 05:03.717
no American troops had ever been in before, the 
people there were afraid of us, which might be

05:04.895 --> 05:24.743
quite natural, because for years they had the 
French terrorizing them, and then they had the VC

05:04.895 --> 05:24.743
terrorizing them and taking their rice, and now 
they had us, and if they were too friendly toward

05:04.895 --> 05:24.743
us, the VC would note that and come back that night 
and do something, harm them. So my attitude

05:25.955 --> 05:41.382
changed from one of, well, this is a good idea, and 
I'm sure everything's progressing well, and

05:25.955 --> 05:41.382
we've got the best minds and the best and the 
brightest thinking about this and doing it, to one

05:25.955 --> 05:41.382
of the South Vietnamese troops were not pulling an 
equal share. The South Vietnamese civilians were

05:42.023 --> 05:44.567
afraid of us. They didn't seem to know how. They may 
not have been so afraid of us, but they didn't know

05:47.412 --> 05:50.798
how to handle us. And they were caught between the 
VC and us. But the feeling that they gave us was not

05:56.625 --> 06:02.633
one of overwhelming welcome, in my opinion. So 
then these feelings, are they the reasons, or you

06:03.715 --> 06:10.484
ended up joining the Veterans Against the War? 
What made you do that? Well, going back to that

06:14.610 --> 06:18.135
about three weeks to a month, After being in 
country, as my attitude began to change after

06:18.537 --> 06:29.432
being there two weeks, two more weeks down the 
road, I'm only in country a month, we're getting

06:18.537 --> 06:29.432
casualties. We're in a heavy booby-trapped area. 
They snipe at us. We rarely at this point engage a

06:32.856 --> 06:37.062
large group of enemy. It's snipers and booby 
traps. And almost daily, every other day,

06:40.787 --> 06:46.755
somebody was injured by a booby trap. And just the 
responses that we had, you know, we were limited in

06:47.427 --> 06:54.355
our responses. They were across the border. We 
couldn't do anything about it. It was, you know, we

06:58.099 --> 07:16.860
operated on body counts and the...

06:58.099 --> 07:16.860
Well, specifically though, I mean, you get home 
and your attitudes change, but... What was it

07:17.026 --> 07:23.232
that, why did you, your reasons for joining the 
VBAW?

07:25.334 --> 07:26.556
Well, it was a good night last night. A month after 
being there, I came to realize that the people

07:27.517 --> 07:36.966
above me in the chain of command didn't really want 
to hear what I thought about what was going on. They

07:37.707 --> 07:39.428
didn't want to hear what my men thought. I started 
out as a squad leader. A month later, I was a platoon

07:41.611 --> 07:47.016
sergeant.

07:47.941 --> 07:48.722
They didn't want to hear. The war had been 
diagnosed. It had been decided by computers and

07:51.646 --> 08:04.764
statistical data, primarily by McNamara, 
Secretary of Defense McNamara, that the war was

07:51.646 --> 08:04.764
being won and it was progressing in a certain way 
and it should be done this way. And the military

08:05.345 --> 08:14.337
leaders above us apparently did not want to have 
data and figures presented to them and ideas which

08:05.345 --> 08:14.337
disproved that or were contrary to that. And so 
instead of coming out with a grassroots level,

08:14.924 --> 08:23.529
having an open-door policy, the general never 
came out and said, hey, what do you guys think about

08:14.924 --> 08:23.529
how we ought to do things? It was always, well, this 
is the way we're doing it, and there's a grand

08:23.549 --> 08:29.828
strategy, and we really don't care that you think 
otherwise. So then you thought the veterans

08:30.027 --> 08:36.196
against the war was a means of expressing what 
wasn't being expressed at NAM. Absolutely. And

08:37.858 --> 08:50.757
also, the VFW and American Legion had indicated 
that they very clearly supported the American

08:37.858 --> 08:50.757
effort, a political position they had to take. But 
they also indicated that the veterans of Vietnam

08:51.378 --> 08:56.085
supported the effort. And that was not true in my 
area, and it was not true with a lot of veterans. And

09:01.457 --> 09:08.747
we were on the cutting edge of, we were the first 
veterans to say, we don't believe in the war, the

09:01.457 --> 09:08.747
war isn't being run right. What the press tells us, 
what the military tells the press to tell the

09:09.608 --> 09:20.503
people here, there's a lot of factual inaccuracy, 
and we want to set the record straight. And we think

09:21.277 --> 09:25.445
we're over there dying and we're not going to win 
the war. I arrived in country in September of 1969.

09:30.594 --> 09:42.677
My feeling by October, sometime in October, was 
that we were not going to win the war because the

09:30.594 --> 09:42.677
South Vietnamese were not going to support us 
strongly enough once we were removed.

09:43.130 --> 09:48.355
It just seemed apparent at that point to me and to 
the people in my unit that that was going to happen.

09:48.755 --> 09:53.519
I don't think anyone really thought that the South 
Vietnamese were going to keep the North

09:48.755 --> 09:53.519
Vietnamese out once we left. So when was it then 
that you joined the Veterans Against the War?

10:00.166 --> 10:06.211
About six months after I got back and tried to get 
into some normalcy again. I was at school and I

10:06.231 --> 10:10.555
noticed the signs around campus saying, Vietnam 
Veterans Against the War Meeting Room, such and

10:10.906 --> 10:14.291
such. And I didn't know whether I wanted to get into 
it with these people or not, and I didn't know what

10:14.972 --> 10:22.863
they stood for. And so I kind of walked by the room a 
number of times and paused and listened to the

10:22.923 --> 10:38.044
conversations going on and smoked a cigarette 
outside the door, trying to decide whether I

10:22.923 --> 10:38.044
wanted to talk to these people or whether they 
represented something other than I did. And so I

10:38.733 --> 10:43.642
joined them, ended up joining them about nine 
months after I got back. I probably joined them in

10:43.782 --> 10:57.406
the winter of January, February of 1971. Now this 
was on, what campus was this? The beautiful campus

11:02.527 --> 11:08.015
of Mankato State College, where tuition is low and 
girls are easy. So when you joined, did you find

11:10.759 --> 11:16.246
that they reflected the same things that you were 
thinking then? Everyone had their own slightly

11:18.810 --> 11:29.445
unique perspective, but there was a common thread 
which bound the veterans there in that group that

11:30.539 --> 11:35.068
And the thread was that the government, our 
government, was lying to the military. The

11:35.730 --> 11:40.600
military was lying to the government, and they 
were both lying to the people here about what was

11:35.730 --> 11:40.600
going on. Because we were always winning the war. 
There were major new breakthroughs, new

11:43.005 --> 11:45.830
developments. We were continually turning the 
corner on the war over there. But yet we were over

11:50.072 --> 11:51.313
there. We saw the headlines in the American papers 
that our relatives would send to us while we were in

11:51.794 --> 11:58.643
Vietnam, which would say that we were turning the 
corner. But yet we felt very clearly that was not

11:59.064 --> 12:04.631
the case, that this was all media hyperbole.

12:07.255 --> 12:10.459
That's hyperbole.

12:10.479 --> 12:15.666
What then was the size of the organization that you 
joined, would you say? When I joined, there were

12:17.148 --> 12:28.044
probably about 25 members on a roll that would 
usually get together once a week. We would have

12:28.064 --> 12:33.091
between 20 and 25 people showing up once a week. And 
then we began to socialize outside of those

12:33.111 --> 12:39.080
meetings, run into each other in the union, have 
more discussions. Did you eventually work your

12:40.302 --> 12:44.488
way up into some sort of... official position, or 
were you just one of the members? Yeah, I did.

12:49.813 --> 12:56.480
After, from that 25-member start, we decided that 
it wasn't enough to just gather in a room and talk

12:49.813 --> 12:56.480
about this. We contacted a printing company, and 
we had some mailers developed. We were able to get

13:05.109 --> 13:09.574
the school to release the name of all the veterans 
on campus. So we mailed to every veteran on campus.

13:13.055 --> 13:28.697
and asked them if they were interested in joining, 
and asked them what their political views were,

13:13.055 --> 13:28.697
and encouraged them to come on down to one of our 
meetings, regardless of their political views,

13:13.055 --> 13:28.697
because we wanted this to be a group of veterans, 
rather than a select group who had a specific idea.

13:29.198 --> 13:32.863
We wanted it to be as encompassing as we possibly 
could. And eventually I became regional

13:34.285 --> 13:41.796
coordinator for Minnesota, Iowa, and the North 
Dakotas and Montana, five-state region. Now,

13:43.092 --> 13:50.875
that seems like a fairly quick, when you say you 
eventually became the coordinator now, was that a

13:43.092 --> 13:50.875
fairly short period of time or? I mean, it was 
probably over a four-month period, three to

13:51.192 --> 13:54.757
four-month period. How do you account for rising 
so high, let's say, so quickly? Because I was very

13:58.642 --> 14:04.791
much less burnt out at that point than other vets 
were. I was probably, I had a better media image. I

14:09.818 --> 14:15.225
was more articulate and less, definitely less 
radical. And in meetings, I strongly believe in

14:15.205 --> 14:23.456
the democratic process and the marketplace of 
ideas. And I want to hear what everybody thinks.

14:26.621 --> 14:28.483
And that's kind of why. People just said, well, he 
doesn't have the long hair. He represents a good

14:31.287 --> 14:32.809
image. He states our position well. Let's make him 
deal with the public. Because we don't want a long

14:38.017 --> 14:44.065
hair who looks like a radical hippie trying to get 
these points across because we'll only... hurt

14:44.635 --> 14:46.237
the points we're trying to make. You mentioned 
radical. Did you have some radicals within? And if

14:51.263 --> 14:53.466
so, what do you mean by radical? Well, yeah, we had 
people whose ideas about any number of things were

14:54.327 --> 15:00.335
more radical than mine. You know, radical being 
noticeably different than what most people

15:00.835 --> 15:12.330
perceived the mainstream idea to be at that time.

15:13.525 --> 15:20.453
We had some who claimed that they didn't care what 
happened to the American POWs in Vietnam. You

15:20.473 --> 15:34.370
know, a stance that we didn't agree with, but there 
was one person in particular who always used to

15:20.473 --> 15:34.370
argue that the American pilots in the Air Force who 
flew the bombing missions who got shot down and

15:20.473 --> 15:34.370
were in captivity deserved it because they were 
indiscriminately bombing. And that's not a

15:35.151 --> 15:38.655
position the rest of us identified with or agreed 
to. Well, as regional coordinator then, what were

15:39.260 --> 15:46.039
your tactics in trying to have the truth be known? 
We contacted, we started out in the Mankato area

15:47.984 --> 15:54.923
and the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, in the Mankato 
area. We contacted the Kiwanis Club, the Lions

15:55.426 --> 16:21.815
Clubs, the various schools in the area, the 
political parties, and we had a group, a team of

15:55.426 --> 16:21.815
four of us, who would go out and address, say, the 
Hilltop Kiwanis Noon Luncheon Meetings and

15:55.426 --> 16:21.815
present our views and try to engage in a discussion 
with the folks there. And we wanted to tell them,

16:25.126 --> 16:25.947
We're veterans. We're patriotic veterans. The 
government's saying that we're winning the war.

16:30.814 --> 16:32.035
We are not winning the war. At some point, we're 
going to pull out. We think it's foolish to

16:33.858 --> 16:38.063
continue to commit troops on the level that we're 
doing it now. Either we go in and win the war, or we

16:38.484 --> 16:43.030
ought to get out. Because once we leave, we 
believed that there was going to be a bloodbath and

16:43.170 --> 16:52.703
that

16:43.170 --> 16:52.703
we were eventually going to lose. So we did that in 
the Mankato area. In the St. Paul, Minneapolis

16:54.682 --> 16:59.729
area, we conducted the same things on the 
university campus. On all of the campuses in the

17:00.490 --> 17:09.623
area, we would come on and set up booths, talk to 
people, try and conduct rallies, send speakers.

17:10.484 --> 17:12.727
And we would occasionally get together. We'd call 
a press conference to announce this or that in

17:12.767 --> 17:18.295
relation to our activities. Did any of these 
rallies meet with any resistance? Or were they

17:23.497 --> 17:29.605
always, and by resistance I'm implying today, 
rallies get out of hand like they did in some points

17:23.497 --> 17:29.605
in the nation? No, we were extremely careful. We 
knew that this was happening and was creating bad

17:34.892 --> 17:38.536
press in other areas. We didn't want rallies to get 
out of hand. We didn't want a bunch of emotional

17:41.680 --> 17:45.505
people running around screaming slogans. People 
to sit down and think about what we were saying and

17:46.210 --> 17:56.484
be rational and logical and view it from that 
perspective. And we were extremely careful to

17:57.886 --> 18:02.052
keep things from getting out of hand. There are 
always a couple of people who believe, proclaim to

18:02.413 --> 18:11.205
believe so strongly in this or that or, you know, 
that the government was wrong in being there that

18:02.413 --> 18:11.205
they would say and do things which we didn't 
condone. And when that happened, we'd ask them for

18:14.505 --> 18:19.112
the good of everybody to tone it down. And only on a 
few occasions did they not tone it down. By the time

18:25.621 --> 18:32.310
you joined, say in 71, Nixon had already 
implemented his Vietnamization. And that in

18:33.412 --> 18:39.741
itself tended to withdraw a lot from the anti-war 
movement. affect your cause at all? Well, in our

18:41.991 --> 18:56.465
perspective, it did not tend to draw a lot to take 
away from the anti-war movement, the volatilism

18:41.991 --> 18:56.465
or the emotionalism, because we didn't believe 
that it was actually occurring. We just believed

18:57.206 --> 19:06.775
the same thing we believed when we started, that 
once our troops withdrew, the country was going to

18:57.206 --> 19:06.775
go North Vietnamese. that for whatever reasons 
the South Vietnamese who identified with us were

19:07.058 --> 19:13.107
not going to prevent that from happening. They had 
us there for a number of years. We never figured out

19:16.231 --> 19:18.314
how to do it. We knew that the country was going to 
fall. We thought it was silly to say that

19:20.817 --> 19:25.865
Vietnamization is occurring, that the 
Vietnamese are taking over the war. They weren't

19:26.405 --> 19:27.747
taking over the war. All they were doing is the 
Americans were being withdrawn, and they weren't

19:27.867 --> 19:32.734
taking over the war. They never did. They lost 
conclusively in a very short period of time, And I

19:37.197 --> 19:47.022
don't think anyone, it just seems so impossible 
that anyone seriously thought that they were

19:37.197 --> 19:47.022
going to be able to defend the country. the Arvin 
invasion of Laos would testify to that fact since

19:47.407 --> 19:54.799
they ended up pulling out on March 25th. Was there 
any response to that from your vets against the

19:56.041 --> 20:00.188
war? I mean, two days later, there was about 50,000 
people nationwide that were protesting of some

20:00.208 --> 20:06.097
sort. Anything up here happen in Minnesota after 
that in particular? You know, our response was

20:12.652 --> 20:23.889
we'd get up in the morning and have coffee and read 
the Wall Street Journal or pick out the headlines

20:12.652 --> 20:23.889
and listen to the radio, find out what had occurred 
when something had happened. We'd go about and

20:23.929 --> 20:31.620
we'd try and contact and set up more speaking 
engagements and that kind of thing. Maybe hold a

20:31.640 --> 20:36.988
press conference up here in the Twin Cities 
involving some of the other local people. And we

20:37.103 --> 20:41.923
became more involved with Citizens for Peace and 
some of the other peace organizations. And we

20:42.847 --> 20:47.687
began to coordinate the veterans with the 
non-veteran peace organizations. I don't

20:47.937 --> 20:51.082
specifically recall that we did anything else at 
that time. Okay, because some groups, they tend

20:51.102 --> 21:05.963
to, as incidents like that happen with this, start 
with the invasion of Cambodia, and then now here

20:51.102 --> 21:05.963
we've got Laos, and then some of the Christmas 
bombings you see reciprocal or parallel anti-war

20:51.102 --> 21:05.963
demonstrations going on. That's why I was asking 
that. So by... February, January 31st through

21:11.427 --> 21:19.017
February 2nd of 72, you had the Winter Soldier 
Hearings in Detroit. Did the Minnesota charter or

21:19.658 --> 21:24.825
chapter play any part in that or any thoughts on 
that? Well, we helped coordinate setting them up

21:26.367 --> 21:38.464
and lended our support to the national 
organization and thought it was an awfully good

21:26.367 --> 21:38.464
idea because One of the major issues in this area at 
that time, as it was in the Detroit and across the

21:38.950 --> 21:49.806
nation, was that there had been a number of 
atrocities committed by American troops. And the

21:52.190 --> 21:58.319
government was attempting to deny that and say 
that wasn't the case. These atrocities were

21:59.080 --> 22:02.425
committed for a number of reasons. The pressure 
that was put on the troops in an area, the faulty

22:02.665 --> 22:08.113
military strategy. where Americans were 
continually sniped down and harassed and

22:08.617 --> 22:20.108
eventually reacted less than competently. Well, 
overall, that seemed to not have much effect,

22:21.049 --> 22:25.253
though. And maybe that's what precipitated the 
March on Washington and the April

22:25.914 --> 22:32.140
demonstrations. And preceding that 
demonstration, the Vets Against the War had a

22:32.160 --> 22:37.425
week-long rally. And that was typified by John 
Kerry's speech in Congress and then ended with the

22:38.114 --> 22:45.841
throwing the medals back over to the Capitol. The 
Winter Soldier hearings in Detroit probably had a

22:47.142 --> 22:58.212
net detrimental effect to the anti-war movement 
because we ended up with people. Here's the first

22:59.033 --> 23:06.940
time that a group of vets gets together and says, 
yes, I saw, witnessed, and was part of atrocities.

23:07.223 --> 23:14.891
and broke down were very emotional and graphic in 
describing what units, during what time span,

23:07.223 --> 23:14.891
exactly what they did. They had long hair. They 
weren't the PR people. They looked like they were

23:21.958 --> 23:25.321
emotional basket cases in a number of cases. So 
here you have the first people that say Americans

23:25.922 --> 23:29.345
are committing atrocities. They're basically 
saying we committed them. They're saying we ought

23:32.208 --> 23:33.850
to get out of the war. And they have a disheveled 
appearance. So people seem to identify and say,

23:36.468 --> 23:45.241
well, those crazies did crazy things when they 
were in NAMM, and now they're part of Vietnam

23:36.468 --> 23:45.241
Veterans Against the War. That must be a crazies 
organization. I think it really hurt us. Then we

23:49.887 --> 23:54.293
rebound to John Kerry, who was by far and away our 
most effective spokesman.

24:01.183 --> 24:05.850
That was the high point of our organization after 
his congressional testimony. Now, did you have

24:06.657 --> 24:10.462
any meetings with John Kerry? Shortly after that, 
in November of that year, we held a national

24:12.104 --> 24:29.407
conference of Vietnam veterans against the war, 
state coordinators and regional coordinators,

24:12.104 --> 24:29.407
and the National Steering Committee. We got 
together in Kansas City, and that was the second

24:29.647 --> 24:36.276
time that I met John Kerry personally. He'd 
attended a rally that we had held at Mankato with a

24:36.914 --> 24:47.204
number of potential presidential candidates and 
local state political figures. And he and I

24:48.525 --> 24:53.450
attended the Kansas convention. And we were by 
far, in my opinion, we were the only two who were not

24:53.510 --> 25:00.698
wacko radical at that point. In fact, Minnesota, 
our region, we ended up withdrawing from the

25:06.648 --> 25:14.637
national VVAW movement because they were at a 
place we couldn't identify. One of the proposals

25:14.697 --> 25:27.731
was that we make tape-recorded conversations and 
say, you know, hello, I'm, you know, former

25:14.697 --> 25:27.731
Sergeant so-and-so from such-and-such a unit. 
You know, you Americans in Vietnam, you know,

25:28.471 --> 25:32.075
we're not winning the war. There's no sense that 
you lose your life. Why don't you do whatever you

25:34.217 --> 25:35.659
can to cause disruption in the military, and 
potentially you'll get home earlier. One of the

25:40.833 --> 25:46.284
suggestions was that a number of people do that, 
and we pass these tapes out to GIs. And in my

25:47.366 --> 25:54.741
consideration, that would have been a treasonous 
act, and I thought it was just a lot of baloney. And

25:55.202 --> 25:55.943
at that point, people were talking about all kinds 
of bourgeoisie and all the radical political

25:56.378 --> 26:08.677
terms and were extremely emotional, but not very 
logical and rational. And they'd given up the idea

26:09.358 --> 26:12.683
of conducting, press with the people. They 
weren't going to logically get through to new

26:15.044 --> 26:24.494
people so that new people who hadn't really 
thought about this would start to influence their

26:15.044 --> 26:24.494
congressmen. So the democratic process would 
come into play. So Kerry was against that kind of

26:27.617 --> 26:29.840
talk also? Yeah. He and I were the only two 
coordinators that I recall at this meeting who

26:30.260 --> 26:34.144
were. And you ended up withdrawing then? We ended 
up withdrawing because, yeah, we were... Our

26:41.637 --> 26:48.545
group, I and another fellow from Minnesota, we 
were kind of shunned because we weren't radical

26:41.637 --> 26:48.545
enough for him. What happened with Kerry then? 
Shortly, there was a movement afoot at that time to

26:52.310 --> 27:06.868
diminish his role in VVAW because other people had 
banded together and either wanted the personal

26:52.310 --> 27:06.868
limelight or didn't think that his political 
position was radical enough. And his prominence

27:07.473 --> 27:12.841
and his role disappeared at that point. Also 
during those April demonstrations, do you think

27:14.403 --> 27:22.053
the thousand or so vets that threw back their 
medals, was that a radical act? What do you think

27:22.073 --> 27:24.877
about that? No, I don't. I think that was a more 
widespread, more patriotic act. They threw back

27:30.265 --> 27:33.970
the medals because they didn't believe that the 
war was being conducted in a proper way or should

27:34.473 --> 27:38.758
have existed. And the larger number of them tended 
to support the more grass-root feeling among the

27:40.140 --> 27:45.627
vets. Well, it seemed then, after that week, that 
compared to the Winter Soldier hearings, that

27:47.109 --> 27:54.137
this had some positive effect. After all, it 
climaxed with 500,000 people marching in

27:54.257 --> 27:58.202
Washington. That must have been a good feeling. It 
was. It was. And in my mind, there's no doubt but

28:02.361 --> 28:17.957
that Vietnam Veterans Against the War mobilized 
and made more people aware of the follies of

28:02.361 --> 28:17.957
Vietnam than any other movement. And it probably 
had a greater political impact than any other

28:17.977 --> 28:27.447
organization during that 10-year time span.

28:29.873 --> 28:31.855
You mentioned the more radical aspects. With the 
continuing presence of US troops in Nam, actions

28:32.836 --> 28:40.705
got more radical. For example, you have 1,500 
students storming the ROTC building in Michigan,

28:41.205 --> 28:49.294
and such similar actions overall. Did you have 
growing radicalism, say, here in the U of M? Or how

28:53.819 --> 28:55.781
do you guys deal with that? I mean, for instance, 
just to... December 26 and 30, you've got the

29:00.282 --> 29:08.710
bombing, intensive bombing of North Vietnam, and 
the Vietnam vets against the war. Some seize

29:08.790 --> 29:24.685
national monuments to make a quick protest, lock 
themselves up in Betsy Ross's house, or locking,

29:08.790 --> 29:24.685
staying inside the Statue of Liberty and 
unfolding a US flag upside down. Did you all do

29:24.846 --> 29:26.307
anything? like that? We didn't do anything like 
that. We tried to increase our getting more press,

29:30.976 --> 29:42.076
putting articles in the paper, attending more 
meetings, holding more meetings. We tried to

29:42.878 --> 29:48.227
continue in a more rational way. We really, the 
Midwestern liberalism, believing in the

29:48.427 --> 30:04.461
democratic process, we thought our whole 
strategy from day one was to inform more people of

29:48.427 --> 30:04.461
our perspective, talk to them, give them a chance 
to think about this, and eventually they'd

30:05.183 --> 30:08.109
influence a political process. We really didn't 
go in for anything quite that sudden and radical

30:08.591 --> 30:18.292
because we thought that in this area it would only 
have a deleterious effect. How about in the

30:21.164 --> 30:31.574
Republican convention in Miami in 72, you've got 
the three Vietnam vets against the war who managed

30:21.164 --> 30:31.574
to shout down and interrupt Nixon's speech before 
they were dragged off. Is that one of these radical

30:31.654 --> 30:36.287
gestures that you wouldn't have supported? I 
wouldn't have supported that. I would have, you

30:38.732 --> 30:47.267
know, if they wanted to interrupt him to make a 
point because they were not being presented a

30:38.732 --> 30:47.267
forum, that's fine. But, you know, they thought it 
was necessary that they be dragged off. We always

30:52.936 --> 31:03.253
tried to facilitate, you know, anyone and 
everyone's point of view, and we just didn't agree

30:52.936 --> 31:03.253
with some, and we would, you know, try to 
rationally discuss those.
