00:01.668 --> 00:06.974
In 1976 at 12 noon, I, Nancy Huber, interviewed 
Mrs. Freda Box. She has been a resident of Bryan,

00:07.655 --> 00:14.843
Texas proper since 1952, and she lived near Bryan 
for the most part of her life. Mrs. Box is now

00:15.704 --> 00:22.672
working at the Texas Agricultural Extension 
Service on the Texas A&M campus in College

00:15.704 --> 00:22.672
Station, Texas.

00:28.399 --> 00:30.021
First of all, How long ago did your family come to 
the area to bond? When I was eight years old. My

00:40.423 --> 00:47.990
parents moved to, not in town, but out in the 
country. In the country. Uh-huh. And where were

00:48.530 --> 00:50.632
you born? Duval, Texas. Duval? Uh-huh. Duval, 
Texas. What year? 1914. 1914. Um, why did your

00:53.495 --> 00:58.860
family decide to move to this area?

01:03.667 --> 01:07.352
Do you have a lot of relatives around here? No. My 
immediate family is in this country. That was my

01:11.857 --> 01:13.379
maiden name. Schultz? Uh-huh. German. Yes. Are 
there a lot of German people around? I mean, of the

01:22.050 --> 01:26.635
white people that are in this area, are they 
German? Well, around the Curtin area, the

01:26.656 --> 01:31.902
majority are German. Okay. Were

01:35.242 --> 01:44.772
you born in your home or not in a hospital? Did the 
doctor come to your house? He did. Okay. Do you have

01:49.957 --> 01:55.483
any brothers or sisters? Yes, I have two sisters 
and two brothers. And I guess you started school

01:57.104 --> 01:59.847
here. Well, I'm in the little edge community. It's 
about 20 miles out from Fulton-Grasses County.

02:08.349 --> 02:08.890
From Grasses County. That's neat. And how did you 
get there? I rode a little donkey with a neighbor

02:11.713 --> 02:15.376
boy. You rode a donkey? Yeah. I mean, do most people 
just get their horse or something? Well, horses

02:22.203 --> 02:23.384
are buddies. I walked. If they were close enough, 
they wouldn't have buses being out there. Yeah.

02:28.329 --> 02:29.850
How far were you from the school? about four 
months.

02:34.699 --> 02:37.142
Four more people. That's interesting. What did 
you, what kind of things did you do for leisure time

02:38.144 --> 02:43.512
activities? Where did young people go to meet 
other young people? Well, we had our community

02:49.100 --> 02:52.725
gatherings, you know, little parties in the 
house, mostly. And then at the schoolhouse we'd

02:52.745 --> 02:57.913
have gatherings and programs. plays and stuff 
like that more than they do now, I think. Yeah, I

03:01.678 --> 03:04.061
guess the school was more of a... It was a means of 
getting the people together again. Yeah. Um, was

03:07.246 --> 03:09.409
there just one schoolhouse? How was the school set 
up? Was it just one building with not one

03:11.892 --> 03:15.197
classroom? I believe we had two buildings in our 
school when I was... One teacher taught the whole

03:15.217 --> 03:23.789
grade, too. They're not divided like they are now. 
Each teacher had a room. Mm-hmm. They had that same

03:28.910 --> 03:40.948
teacher all the way through

03:28.910 --> 03:40.948
that year. What did you do on Sundays?

03:45.975 --> 03:53.466
Well, most of the time, if we went to Sunday school 
and then we'd gather with our friends, maybe walk

03:45.975 --> 03:53.466
across the way to We'd be a bunch of us, get 
together, we'd go walking in the Bluzard, I don't

03:53.834 --> 04:01.742
know, highway or something, you know, maybe at one 
of those homes. So it was kind of generally a kind of

04:02.502 --> 04:05.966
get together. It was. More than now you have to work 
or something. Kind of that. What kind of things did

04:11.751 --> 04:21.040
you do on holidays, such as Easter, Thanksgiving, 
was there any, Fourth of July, was there any kind of

04:11.751 --> 04:21.040
community thing? Well, usually there'd be a 
picnic on Fourth of July. just about everybody in

04:23.990 --> 04:28.774
the community would go. It would be down on the 
river bank or at the community center or somewhere

04:28.794 --> 04:32.037
like that. Did they have fireworks? Some, but not 
as much as they do now or in later years. Do you

04:40.645 --> 04:49.753
recall any fads, anything, fashions that was the 
thing to do? Any dances? What kind of dances did you

04:51.315 --> 04:52.596
do? I didn't dance. I never danced. You never 
danced? I mean, the kids around. Yeah, they did.

04:59.495 --> 05:03.860
They did the Charleston and the waltz and stuff 
like that. Was there a lot of country-western? I

05:06.423 --> 05:10.408
don't

05:06.423 --> 05:10.408
know. Folk and waltz music mostly, I imagine. 
Yeah. I don't know too much about that. I don't know

05:16.716 --> 05:22.363
too much about country-western, so. Okay.

05:26.208 --> 05:33.275
Could you tell me about your first job and what kind

05:26.208 --> 05:33.275
of pay you had? Well, when I was growing up, you 
know, the working public jobs, all we did then was

05:33.295 --> 05:39.762
maybe help somebody in the fields or somewhere. 
The week before I married, I worked one whole week

05:41.103 --> 05:47.950
to make enough money to buy my wedding dress. We got 
50 cents a day and worked from sunup to sundown.

05:52.655 --> 05:54.096
What kind of work did you do? I worked in corn. I was 
out in the cornfield all by myself that whole week.

06:00.024 --> 06:00.144
Wow. When did you get married?

06:04.490 --> 06:06.553
1936. 1936. And where did you and your husband 
live? We lived out there for a while, and later we

06:09.738 --> 06:17.989
had moved to Houston when the war came on. Ah, you 
moved to Houston. Okay. We lived there three

06:19.692 --> 06:20.233
years. People were going to shoot me in those 
years. Was that your reason

06:21.558 --> 06:35.549
for

06:21.558 --> 06:35.549
moving to Houston? For the job or what? Well, I 
don't know. It was just a good opportunity for us.

06:39.498 --> 06:40.360
Pretty good pay. More than we've been, like, you 
know, a farm or something. Yeah. Your family then,

06:44.902 --> 06:51.857
your father, I guess, you were farmers? Uh-huh. 
And what kind of things, you know, corn, I guess,

06:52.839 --> 06:56.086
what else? Corn, cotton, and vegetables, of 
course. Maybe some hay and peanuts. Mm-hmm. You

07:00.674 --> 07:06.864
didn't just, you know, you sold a lot of this stuff. 
You didn't just, it wasn't just for your family,

07:06.884 --> 07:09.889
right? We sold what come and a lot of corn too. But 
then the vegetables and stuff like that. The hay

07:15.578 --> 07:19.284
was for our own use. For your own use. If you can. But 
we just wanted a small scale of what the family

07:19.905 --> 07:25.033
could do. Yeah. You know, you don't have big farms 
generally like you do now. How

07:28.518 --> 07:33.504
many acres ? We might have farmed about 60 or 70, 
something like that. What changes have you

07:41.154 --> 07:46.641
noticed? OK, so you went to Houston. You were there 
for three years. That was during the war.

07:55.872 --> 07:58.255
Everybody was called in to register them. But he 
had family. He was a little older than the general

08:02.848 --> 08:11.113
draft age, too, so it would get what it gets for him. 
During the Depression, what kind of things do you

08:13.557 --> 08:17.081
remember? Would it be as hard to get, you know, 
food, appliances? Some of it said, you know, it was

08:22.807 --> 08:27.192
really difficult to get appliances. Did you have 
any troubles like that? I don't guess we had very

08:28.313 --> 08:30.936
many of them back then, honey, except the icebox. 
Yeah. We didn't have electricity or anything

08:31.977 --> 08:34.339
then. We just laid out in the forehead. Yeah. So I 
don't really know. Of course, we raised a lot of our

08:39.882 --> 08:46.591
food, so we really never did suffer from food like a 
lot of people did. Yeah. So you were, generally

08:46.852 --> 08:57.346
speaking, as far as just surviving, you were a

08:46.852 --> 08:57.346
lot better off than a lot of people? Yes, we were. We 
were black for food or, you know, the comforts of

08:58.367 --> 09:01.952
home. Yeah, right. Okay, did people used to travel 
a lot to other towns? Well, first of all, when did

09:06.747 --> 09:12.775
you move back to the San Diego? After the war, in 
about 44. About 44. Well, I didn't go to the course

09:17.642 --> 09:20.787
to eventually get paid. When I was just a job, well, 
they'd travel in a wagon or a buggy when they wanted

09:20.807 --> 09:27.175
to go somewhere. Of course, that would maybe like 
to know how to chill, come to town once in a while.

09:31.361 --> 09:34.746
But about the extent of your travels, We could go 
visit relatives or something in another town.

09:40.596 --> 09:41.136
Yeah, yeah. And what were, what different towns 
did, you know, people go to? I mean, what other

09:45.300 --> 09:52.326
towns were, you know, kind of a big place to go? We 
went to Houston sometimes because we had

09:52.447 --> 09:54.709
relatives there. We went to Elkhart and 
Palestine. That's where my husband's family

09:57.651 --> 09:59.413
lived. So, mostly he went where he went visiting, 
you know, rather than sightseeing it. Just on

10:04.240 --> 10:11.234
vacations like you

10:04.240 --> 10:11.234
do now. Have you ever been out of Texas? Oh, yes. I 
went on several vacation trips. We went on through

10:17.807 --> 10:21.334
the north and the northwest. I've never been east. 
I've been to Kansas City. You just went on

10:26.768 --> 10:31.436
vacation? Yes. Do you have any children? Yes, we 
have six children.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.518
They are all grown and married. Were they raised in 
this area? Yes. They are all brought in schools.

10:52.148 --> 10:55.872
Okay, you came back to this area after you moved to 
Houston, after the loan. Did you, were you then

10:56.253 --> 10:59.637
moved, did you move into Brown? No, not directly. 
We still moved back to Edge Farm three years. Then

11:04.662 --> 11:06.805
we moved into the Tabor community. We lived out 
there about three years. And in 1951, we moved into

11:09.248 --> 11:11.550
Brown. I see. Why did you go into the Tabor 
community? Well, it was just, we bought a little

11:16.356 --> 11:19.419
farm out there. We sued for truck farming. That's 
what we wanted to do. They

11:22.186 --> 11:31.621
started being like with their paper wraps and 
stuff like that. It was more convenient to move to

11:31.641 --> 11:33.504
town. I started working in town. I had heard that 
New Tabor at one time was a really prosperous

11:35.848 --> 11:40.896
place. I don't know if that was when you were there 
or any more. It was Tabor, no. Not New Tabor? No. Ah,

11:48.376 --> 11:50.478
okay. Exactly, like five, six miles to the north. 
And what area of Brownie did you stay on when you

11:55.784 --> 12:00.549
turned 51? On Sandy Point Road, we waged 25th, and I 
still live in that same house. Really? I lost my

12:09.117 --> 12:11.380
husband four years ago. One of my boys lives with 
me, but he's not married at the time. Yeah. So have

12:15.629 --> 12:23.597
your children mainly stayed in the area or moved 
on? Well, one lives in Colorado and one family

12:23.617 --> 12:31.726
lives in Dallas. One of the boys lives in Camp 
Creek. He's postman from my area. He comes in to

12:36.891 --> 12:37.492
work every day. One daughter and one son live here 
in town. So they generally stayed in the area.

12:41.536 --> 12:42.938
Close, yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, going

12:45.886 --> 13:13.277
back to

12:45.886 --> 13:13.277
the, well, I was thinking, I had already talked 
about the world, okay, but Do you remember things

13:14.017 --> 13:19.426
that people did for the war to contribute to, you 
know, the effort? Whether, I don't know, you know,

13:19.446 --> 13:37.474
just a real simple example is like we, I think my 
parents, you know, they separate their trash and

13:19.446 --> 13:37.474
stuff with cans and bottles and everything like 
that. It could be, you know, or they just, you know,

13:37.494 --> 13:41.340
or women going and working in factories or 
whatever. Well, I did, I did,

13:41.658 --> 13:59.660
because

13:41.658 --> 13:59.660
I had as much of a loss for all of that at that time. We 
bought war bonds. What was the advantage of war

14:00.101 --> 14:02.284
bonds? Well, if you kept them so long, you got, you 
know, you made an interest on them, it was like you

14:02.304 --> 14:07.991
were doing a savings account. You could still buy 
savings bonds, you know. They'd take it out of your

14:08.912 --> 14:09.893
salary, and then you'd I always

14:10.126 --> 14:24.190
hear these things, but I guess unless you're even 
part of it, you don't know that. Okay, do you recall

14:24.390 --> 14:33.426
anything from like presidential elections, 
campaigns, who the people voted, or anything? Not

14:33.586 --> 14:33.807
really. I remember real well when Pastor 
Roosevelt Was he pretty popular

14:36.586 --> 14:50.550
with the people through this whole 
administration? He was kind of like

14:50.570 --> 14:58.443
President Kennedy. Everybody liked him. He died 
when it was a shock to me. Yeah, it was really

15:02.675 --> 15:06.120
shocking. We're

15:06.140 --> 15:11.008
starting to lose it. Were there any great 
disasters, like floods? Not necessarily great

15:15.074 --> 15:23.147
disasters, but things that really affected the 
community. Floods, tornadoes, droughts? Well,

15:23.748 --> 15:25.070
there were droughts, yes. Sometimes we formed in 
the river bottom in the same volume where we had big

15:30.940 --> 15:38.487
rains that would flood our farmland, maybe 
destroy our crops. Usually it would be early in the

15:38.507 --> 15:49.637
spring or maybe in the fall after the cotton and 
stuff was made and they were just about ready.

15:49.897 --> 15:52.419
Several times I remember they would get that water 
covered the whole field. And since you just

15:52.620 --> 15:59.766
farmed, so you really didn't have things to go back 
on. back then. They used to do the merchants would

16:03.375 --> 16:16.489
help the farmers, you know, they could borrow 
money to live on the farm with them. Then when they

16:16.509 --> 16:23.277
made money, they would pay

16:16.509 --> 16:23.277
it back. Sometimes you'd go in debt for a year. If 
you had a good year, you'd pay up. Do you remember I

16:25.970 --> 16:39.488
guess when we lived in the city of Vine, things, 
racial things, or even outside, like this area was

16:25.970 --> 16:39.488
primarily blacks, and were there a lot, I don't 
know about Vine, really. Well, yeah, they were

16:39.508 --> 16:47.860
divided, but I mean, most blacks lived over on the 
west and northwest side, which they still do to a

16:39.508 --> 16:47.860
big extent. But there wasn't any trouble when they 
started upgrading the schools, like there was a

16:49.802 --> 16:54.829
lot of places. I want to say some of the kids might 
have gotten scuffles or something like that, but

16:55.147 --> 17:12.468
there wasn't anything to do over it,

16:55.147 --> 17:12.468
you know, between the citizens and all. What 
prompted them to go ahead and integrate? Was it a

17:14.731 --> 17:15.712
cold order? It was an impulsory thing. It was an 
impulsory thing. What was that? Six or eight years

17:23.311 --> 17:34.784
ago,

17:23.311 --> 17:34.784
I don't know what everybody came to. What about 
Mexicans? Are there

17:36.766 --> 17:42.712
a lot in this area? Yes, quite a few. Well, I guess 
over on the west side and south side there's more,

17:43.093 --> 17:49.980
but they're kind of mingling with the other people 
more or less now. They know more than they used to

17:50.000 --> 17:53.284
be. They used to

17:53.500 --> 18:05.080
come in here from Mexico to do farm work instead. 
They can't do that anymore. So those that live here

18:07.123 --> 18:11.571
just work somewhere I would be. There's not too 
much people working in the highway department.

18:16.147 --> 18:26.041
operating equipment or even jobs on the campus and 
stuff like that, just like everybody else. Yeah. I

18:26.262 --> 18:30.187
was going to ask you, what big changes have you seen 
in the technology of farming? I mean, there are a

18:30.207 --> 18:35.214
lot, but what have you noticed? Well, there's not 
very many small farms like we've had anymore. I

18:38.299 --> 18:41.684
mean, it's got soil, you know, expensive to farm. 
They may have to farm on a big scale. And the farming

18:44.530 --> 18:56.164
has gone to the big farmers where it used to be these 
little plots here and there. The people that most

18:56.184 --> 19:10.803
of them that lived on these little farms have moved 
to town because they couldn't make a living on

18:56.184 --> 19:10.803
these little farms. Was farming, you say, on a 
small farm? It was mainly a family thing, and then

19:13.201 --> 19:22.273
whatever extra they had there. What impact do you 
think this university has had on the growth and

19:22.293 --> 19:28.200
development of the area? It's responsible for 
just the biggest part of the growth, because it

19:29.762 --> 19:38.213
brings so many people in here and gets work to so 
many others, too.

19:41.635 --> 19:44.038
I feel like it's just about a half of us. Has put you 
on the map, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Did you notice, you

19:50.626 --> 19:59.116
know, when the university turned to co-ed, was 
there any reaction to that, good or bad? Oh, some

19:59.357 --> 20:06.786
thought they didn't like for the girls to come 
here, but it didn't make any difference. Yeah.

20:08.720 --> 20:27.087
What type of changes

20:08.720 --> 20:27.087
have you noticed in the landscape, like roads, 
ground roads, and transportation? Of course, the

20:27.107 --> 20:32.875
roads have built up a lot, and we've got lots of new 
streets in our town since it has grown so much. Not

20:32.895 --> 20:33.476
all roads were fixed. Like 29th Street, it was just 
a very old road, even until about 15 years ago. I

20:36.720 --> 20:37.782
imagine they just fixed it a little later. That's a 
part of town. Yeah, that's pretty much a man. Any

20:46.193 --> 20:51.020
railways that you have? Well, I don't expect the 
railroads are even as busy as they were in those

20:51.040 --> 20:56.008
days, because they didn't want to work by rail. And 
they stopped the passenger trains. The freight

21:00.194 --> 21:01.055
trains come through now. The same tracks we always 
had. Did people travel a lot on the passenger

21:03.559 --> 21:07.584
trains? They used to. What big

21:08.120 --> 21:36.540
differences do you see, like

21:08.120 --> 21:36.540
when

21:08.120 --> 21:36.540
you were raised and things you used to do, and when 
you raised your children? We

21:38.478 --> 21:46.467
always lived out where our children had room to 
roam around. I think it has a lot to do with the way

21:46.487 --> 21:49.150
children are now. They're so cooped up. They don't 
feel free to go to places like our children did

21:51.372 --> 21:55.397
then. Nobody cared for hunting or fishing or just 
roaming over the place. And now, if you get off of

22:00.442 --> 22:07.270
the highways or your own place, well, you're 
trespassing it.

22:10.996 --> 22:20.000
So they had more freedom to work off their energy, I 
think, that may be one reason for the restlessness

22:10.996 --> 22:20.000
in children now, I feel like it is. And what kind of, 
what like with the radio? Did you use to,

22:25.745 --> 22:35.517
did you have radio when you were young? No, when I 
was a child and ever since I've been there, I've

22:35.537 --> 22:42.546
just come out with my radio. And you used to listen 
to the... We used to listen to music. We used to

22:44.829 --> 22:53.160
listen to stories on radio before we got

22:44.829 --> 22:53.160
a TV. Yeah? What, what, do you recall any that were 
popular on radio? The O.H.B. Yeah. Really? like

22:56.677 --> 23:03.265
gangbusters and things like that.

23:05.067 --> 23:09.353
You know, you take these stories, these stories 
take a lot of things. Yeah. What about television

23:09.913 --> 23:12.937
when it came into the area? I mean, what did people 
think of, you know, television personally? Well,

23:16.862 --> 23:18.644
at first it was kind of scattered, few and far 
between. They were just people that were more, I

23:18.664 --> 23:21.047
guess, wealthier people or...

23:25.178 --> 23:34.809
you know, what are the good circumstances

23:25.178 --> 23:34.809
could afford them for the virus to have been a weird 
species when they first came out. Do you remember

23:34.829 --> 23:52.469
when just the idea of it was that people said, and I 
think that was really strange, like to me I think

23:34.829 --> 23:52.469
talking on the telephone and seeing somebody is 
really weird. I don't know. Do you have friends or

23:54.389 --> 24:17.038
relatives that have moved away from the area for 
any particular reason, maybe economic or, you

23:54.389 --> 24:17.038
know, because there wasn't enough here or they 
have moved

23:54.389 --> 24:17.038
into the area because they just want to go 
somewhere else?

24:19.904 --> 24:35.180
All

24:19.904 --> 24:35.180
of my

24:19.904 --> 24:35.180
family was

24:19.904 --> 24:35.180
German. My brothers and sisters. They all married

24:35.701 --> 24:42.788
German boys, but me, I married an American boy. I 
really messed things up for them. Was your husband

24:46.492 --> 24:49.135
from Germany? No, my husband wasn't German. 
Excuse me, I'm saying the others. My grandparents

24:55.566 --> 25:00.551
came from

24:55.566 --> 25:00.551
Germany. But of course my mother dated people. 
They were from South Texas. Which area in South

25:04.955 --> 25:07.858
Texas? Over in Victoria

25:07.878 --> 25:13.644
and Yoakum and down in that area. You know, my 
relatives on my mother's side were German.

25:18.427 --> 25:22.891
They're in Edmond and Yocum and all that area. You 
know, Edmond is right near Victoria. I

25:30.978 --> 25:41.387
still have relatives in Yocum. The rice is in 
Yocum. I know why, but I have relatives in Yocum.

25:43.629 --> 25:44.009
That's interesting. So I miss a lot of Germany. 
This area has a lot of Germans. I believe it's, most

25:45.410 --> 25:47.252
of the people down there, I believe it's kind of a 
German settlement.

25:50.455 --> 26:05.292
Okay, well, I

25:50.455 --> 26:05.292
think that's all I have to say right now, Ms. Fox. 
I'd like to thank you very much for coming and

26:05.992 --> 26:14.722
taking this time out of your lunchtime to talk with 
me and get this interview. I appreciate it. Thank

26:16.504 --> 26:17.425
you.
