00:03.220 --> 00:06.423
When you were growing up in Bryant, what did you do 
for fun?

00:12.529 --> 00:13.249
At what age? Well, you moved here when you were 12, 
so say 12 to 20.

00:30.005 --> 00:33.008
Well, when I came here when I was 12, Of course, we 
had very little time. I mean, that was true of the

00:36.770 --> 00:42.515
entire society.

00:42.535 --> 00:57.450
We walked to and from school, and

00:42.535 --> 00:57.450
we were close enough to the school and were given 
enough time to go to our homes for lunch. So that

00:57.910 --> 00:59.772
meant that we made

01:04.561 --> 01:08.507
four trips a day to and from school. And then I had 
chores to do around the house at all times. Every

01:17.760 --> 01:32.762
day I had to carry my part of the load, such as 
bringing in the wood to fill the wood boxes at the

01:17.760 --> 01:32.762
fireplace. Shoveling out the hashes, carrying 
out the hashes. Just tasks that a boy of that age

01:37.255 --> 01:42.061
could accomplish. And then generally on good days 
when we could, well in the fall we'd play a little

01:42.081 --> 01:49.370
sand lock football. Five or six or ten 
neighborhood boys would get out and play.

01:59.793 --> 02:05.260
At another time it would be baseball or something 
like that. There was no organized play as such. As a

02:10.447 --> 02:20.460
consequence, we became much more self-reliant 
than the youth of today and much less naive. And I

02:22.062 --> 02:24.045
think had a whole lot better time.

02:29.611 --> 02:34.077
Where did you live when you first came here? I lived 
at 509, I believe it is, East 26th Street. It's just

02:39.444 --> 02:41.507
one block from the courthouse. It's only four 
blocks from Main Street. But I was not permitted to

02:45.472 --> 02:48.836
go to Main Street. Why was that? It just wasn't 
done. I didn't have any business being downtown on

02:51.700 --> 02:57.007
Main Street, so I was not permitted to go. No other 
boy was here.

03:05.183 --> 03:11.930
None of my associates were permitted to do it 
either. Or if they were, I didn't know about it.

03:18.657 --> 03:21.880
But of course, we did have the run of the town as 
such. And

03:23.762 --> 03:33.132
due to the fact that there was a minimum of traffic, 
we could go. virtually anyone's house that we

03:34.951 --> 03:37.735
knew.

03:40.739 --> 04:00.368
If we told where we were going and then were

03:40.739 --> 04:00.368
we were all of us I guess it was social custom today 
instructed that we were not to stay for meals and to

03:40.739 --> 04:00.368
return to our own homes for our meals.

04:00.388 --> 04:01.650
Summertime we had household or yard tasks 
assigned to us virtually every day. Working in

04:09.628 --> 04:16.898
gardens, mowing grass, pulling up weeds, doing 
those things. Then after we got older, like in high

04:17.599 --> 04:28.934
school where we had more privileges, then we could 
come downtown. Were the Moody Houses built then?

04:30.896 --> 04:31.317
Yes. We were allowed, as a growing up boy, if

04:32.883 --> 05:02.367
I did all my tasks, as I was supposed to throughout 
the week, I was granted an allowance, it was

04:32.883 --> 05:02.367
called, which was enough to attend the movie on 
Saturday and to get an ice cream soda, which was

04:32.883 --> 05:02.367
quite a treat. and much looked forward to all week.

05:10.541 --> 05:14.567
Were there any major social events for, say, the 
high school children? Well, yes. We had

05:17.210 --> 05:30.750
junior-senior dance and things like that, and we 
attended football games both here and to a lesser

05:17.210 --> 05:30.750
degree important game there might be a

05:31.490 --> 06:01.142
caravan developed say to go to Caldwell a nearby 
town or if we had done rather well an excursion

05:31.490 --> 06:01.142
might be gotten up like one time I recall we went to 
Waco on we had a special train and the entire

05:31.490 --> 06:01.142
community participated

06:01.662 --> 06:22.394
I would say that, of course, you always talk about 
the good old days weren't really that good, but

06:01.662 --> 06:22.394
really I think in some instances they were in that

06:01.662 --> 06:22.394
events were not so frequent.

06:23.235 --> 06:27.822
People's time was more fully utilized in the 
necessities of living. I mean, just the daily

06:29.287 --> 06:31.630
necessities of living.

06:37.557 --> 06:49.872
When there were events, special events, well, I 
think you appreciated them somewhat more and you

06:37.557 --> 06:49.872
got a much broader participation.

06:55.419 --> 06:58.703
There were numerous cultural events. in the 
community also. Yes,

07:01.821 --> 07:09.612
as was always true, but they were not quite as 
available as they are now. I mean,

07:09.632 --> 07:26.918
but it wasn't too long till you could go buy cars, 
but for instance, they had a program out there in

07:09.632 --> 07:26.918
Guyana Hall when I was just a boy here, very much 
like the

07:30.340 --> 07:34.165
town hall is now of national entertainment 
brought here. For instance, I heard Paul Whiteman

07:34.205 --> 07:44.058
and his great jazz orchestra there when I was about 
13 years old, which I've never forgotten. It was

07:44.078 --> 07:53.631
quite an event because of the

07:44.078 --> 07:53.631
foot-patting nature of the music. It was quite 
appealing to me and all these popular so-called

08:00.817 --> 08:08.847
jazz music has always appealed to me ever since, 
but I shall never forget that. What was the

08:11.030 --> 08:12.912
Depression like in Brown? Did it have a great 
effect here? No. Brown was very fortunate.

08:20.521 --> 08:22.364
We had very few vacant buildings. In fact, 
virtually none. None of our banks went under. None

08:29.112 --> 08:30.013
of our saving his institutions went under.

08:37.143 --> 08:43.969
The professors and related employees at the 
university lived like absolute monarchs in

08:37.143 --> 08:43.969
teams. They were on fixed salaries that had been 
set by the legislature

08:45.791 --> 09:00.945
some two years previous and

08:45.791 --> 09:00.945
those salaries were not changed and legislature 
didn't meet in a special session to reduce them or

09:01.162 --> 09:29.616
anything and as a consequence a just ordinary 
professor out there could afford domestic help

09:01.162 --> 09:29.616
and many of them had they built rent houses and 
really did very well on dollar figures that would

09:31.553 --> 09:57.628
be laughable to you today, but a

09:31.553 --> 09:57.628
man with $250 a month income at that time could just 
really have just almost anything that you might

09:31.553 --> 09:57.628
think you might want and save money too.

10:00.545 --> 10:03.689
This was the consequence. There was very little 
unemployment, relatively speaking. The

10:09.416 --> 10:20.630
agricultural community suffered greatly 
because of virtually just total collapse of farm

10:09.416 --> 10:20.630
prices. But there was active employment here in 
Bryan. People did not lose their jobs and most of

10:26.583 --> 10:33.494
the businesses could and there was a supply of 
money. Money was very dear to come by but we had

10:33.594 --> 10:40.004
quite a concentration of it. Thanks to Texas A&M 
University and

10:40.024 --> 10:54.987
I would say that the hardest hit was the building 
trades but There was, uh, Bryan and College

10:57.110 --> 11:06.023
Station were very fortunate, very fortunate 
indeed.

11:09.028 --> 11:10.970
Were you here during the war, World War II? Yes, a 
portion of it. I served two and a half years in the

11:13.354 --> 11:18.041
military myself. Did the war affect Bryan at all?

11:26.911 --> 11:37.686
Well, yes, I think Bryan and College Station was 
affected by the war in many ways.

11:41.251 --> 11:45.637
One, we had an air base located here called Bryan 
Field.

11:48.881 --> 11:56.732
We also had numerous training units that were 
involved at Texas A&M. It was a Navy unit, Air Force

11:58.163 --> 12:10.224
unit, Army units that were receiving various 
types of training in connection with the

11:58.163 --> 12:10.224
university. There was various programs there 
then. We, like many places, were certainly a

12:25.062 --> 12:28.425
militarily oriented community at that time. We

12:30.147 --> 12:48.466
did not have some of the disasters that other 
communities had in

12:30.147 --> 12:48.466
losing a lot of our young men by death, like 
Caldwell did, for instance. They had part of their

12:50.408 --> 12:54.732
National Guard unit was at Corregidor. little 
town like Caldwell, maybe 2,000 people in, lost 25

12:55.083 --> 13:02.855
of their finest boys one afternoon.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.661
People suffered a lot.

13:15.233 --> 13:21.563
There was hardly ever a day that some friend or the 
son of of a close family or something like that was

13:22.960 --> 13:29.967
not mortally wounded or lost or something. War is 
not a very good time. Was it as big a shock as they

13:34.252 --> 13:40.018
seem to make it in history books to everyone here? 
What? Was December 7th the shock that everyone

13:41.019 --> 13:46.485
says it is? Do you remember that? It was to me. I was a 
young married person. I had a young wife and

13:52.137 --> 14:05.490
three children, three little babies. And I 
remember when it came on the radio that Sunday, it

14:05.510 --> 14:20.644
was very shocking, extremely shocking, but not 
frightening. You weren't frightened? No. Were

14:22.323 --> 14:23.224
you mad? Yes. The whole, the whole nation was 
angry.

14:33.439 --> 14:46.258
I think that, I'll say this, that I'm totally 
convinced, I was then, I continue to be to this day,

14:33.439 --> 14:46.258
that the National Administration totally failed 
to appraise

14:50.997 --> 14:56.282
reaction and the attitude of the citizenship of 
the country. Well,

14:58.705 --> 15:03.550
there was a deliberate effort. Pearl Harbor was 
played down badly. We were not advised until after

15:08.095 --> 15:15.342
World War II was over as to what actually happened 
at Pearl Harbor, how devastating it was.

15:18.605 --> 15:20.127
But it is my best judgment. From what I knew then and 
what I learned later and from my associates and

15:21.153 --> 15:38.212
everyone I knew, they thought the American people 
would, I mean the federal government thought the

15:21.153 --> 15:38.212
people of this country would collapse with fear. 
The people would have fought them with their bare

15:40.214 --> 15:49.624
hands on the beaches, welcomed the opportunity. 
There may be some places where people were

15:50.110 --> 16:04.724
fearful, but I never did hear of them and I never did 
meet anybody later that indicated there was any

15:50.110 --> 16:04.724
fear.

16:12.091 --> 16:14.053
Where did you serve? Just all over the United 
States.

16:19.962 --> 16:40.975
I was 33 years old and I had a wife and three children 
and wasn't actually taken in until I tried for a

16:19.962 --> 16:40.975
commission in every branch of the service except 
the Marines and failed for physical reasons to

16:19.962 --> 16:40.975
qualify. I finally ended up as an instructor in the 
Air Force Ground School. Even though I could fly an

16:47.625 --> 16:53.654
airplane, I couldn't qualify as a flight 
instructor. As a consequence, I was just moved

16:54.395 --> 17:00.504
from pillar to post all over the country. So,

17:00.564 --> 17:07.114
most undistinguished military career. Since 
World War II, Brian, It's really started to grow.

17:14.805 --> 17:18.828
It seemed like to me, I don't know exactly when it 
started, but it grew. What areas do you think have

17:20.189 --> 17:27.035
grown the most in the Brian Codd Station? You mean 
physically? Physically, yeah. Business and

17:31.199 --> 17:34.762
things like that.

17:36.924 --> 17:41.708
Well,

17:36.924 --> 17:41.708
until recently,

17:46.345 --> 17:53.842
The economic and the population growth of Bryan 
and College Station had been relatively uniform.

17:57.110 --> 18:03.645
Going back as far as about 1935, I have seen studies 
that indicated the growth to be at about 3.5% per

18:04.756 --> 18:16.607
annum, taken on an average of five-year bites, 
averaging out bites of five years each. That was

18:17.908 --> 18:22.393
true until about 1960, maybe 1965. The impression 
of substantial growth

18:23.954 --> 18:33.463
has been more acute In the latter stages of that, I 
mean, 3% of 100 is only three. You don't notice

18:44.856 --> 18:48.581
them. But 3% of 1,000 becomes 30. And you begin to 
notice them. But when you get 3% of 10,000, you get

18:53.948 --> 18:58.995
300. and you can and you spot them rather so this is 
what's been occurring but somewhere about 65 or

19:00.359 --> 19:25.945
there on then the growth has begun to accelerate of 
course very obviously the primary area of growth

19:00.359 --> 19:25.945
has been in and around texas a&m university both in 
residential housing, and now more recently, just

19:26.870 --> 19:35.238
an outbreak of student housing in the form of 
apartments.

19:36.559 --> 19:47.269
The enrollment of Texas A&M University has 
increased more than a hundred percent in just

19:36.559 --> 19:47.269
relatively recent years. When President Rutter 
took office, I think the student enrollment was

19:48.390 --> 19:56.117
only about ten thousand.

19:57.481 --> 20:04.710
I understand now that it's near to 24,000, which 
has occurred, what, within eight years? And of

20:06.212 --> 20:26.678
course, this has brought a tremendous influx of

20:06.212 --> 20:26.678
all sorts of services and supply outlets and 
things to service

20:06.212 --> 20:26.678
the population. both student and I. In fact, it's 
only, I would say it's only been in the last 15 years

20:29.281 --> 20:41.456
that the student population has been a factor in 
the community, and don't misunderstand that. I

20:41.496 --> 20:51.768
mean, they were not disregarded, they were 
important, but they primarily lived on campus,

20:41.496 --> 20:51.768
supplied virtually all their needs on campus.

20:55.853 --> 20:56.614
They,

20:59.530 --> 21:05.137
They were not at all the factor in the community 
they have become.

21:09.623 --> 21:11.825
Where do you think the outlook in this area is? Is it 
good? All I can do is take the figures

21:13.748 --> 21:25.082
of the Department of Commerce, which were 
confirmed by the Texas Bureau of Business

21:25.973 --> 21:49.278
Research at Operation Connection University of 
Texas, which I believe rated Bryan and College

21:25.973 --> 21:49.278
Station as number one growth area in the next ten 
years in individual income in the whole United

21:25.973 --> 21:49.278
States, and number two in population.

21:49.298 --> 21:55.525
I think that this is pretty

21:49.298 --> 21:55.525
well a factor. I don't agree with the population 
thing is continuing. I anticipate a plateauing in

22:03.102 --> 22:09.170
population, perhaps.

22:12.194 --> 22:26.052
But obviously the personal income thing, which is 
really the most important in establishing a

22:12.194 --> 22:26.052
lifestyle and standard of living and so forth, Do 
you think there's going to be any industrial

22:27.348 --> 22:34.015
growth? Yes, but not in the sense that the average 
individual thinks in terms of.

22:46.488 --> 22:53.616
I think that the industry that may come will be 
educationally related. I think what we may see

22:53.636 --> 22:55.718
here is more and more

22:56.727 --> 23:24.625
I don't know quite how to put it into words 
technologically oriented consulting firms or

22:56.727 --> 23:24.625
small what they call clean air type industries 
things like that probably service related

22:56.727 --> 23:24.625
industries more than more than the manufacturing 
type. I can't contemplate any manufacturing

23:28.740 --> 23:33.988
simply because we don't have anything to 
manufacture.

23:38.275 --> 23:41.961
Well, I want to thank you again for the interview. 
Well, I think that we ought to go back a little bit.

23:52.017 --> 23:52.958
The

23:56.414 --> 23:59.419
The community is somewhat unique.

24:02.944 --> 24:09.394
It basically was established by the Texas New 
Orleans Railroad. The original town site was

24:10.355 --> 24:18.387
Boomba, which is three miles east of the present 
town site. But the Texas New Orleans Railroad came

24:18.407 --> 24:25.358
through here and bought 640 acres, a league of 
land, from, really it was from the Stephen F.

24:26.080 --> 24:31.026
Austin estate. Mr. Brown, who was related to Mr. 
Marriott, one of Mr. Austin's sisters,

24:31.286 --> 24:50.629
sold them the land and then they surveyed it into 
town lots and so forth. And the railroad,

24:55.645 --> 25:06.558
stopped at Milliken in 1860,

24:55.645 --> 25:06.558
which was a terminus, a railroad terminus, for a 
great distance of country. Near its railhead, to

25:08.881 --> 25:14.367
the north of that railhead, was somewhere in 
Kansas. And everything in between had to go one

25:16.590 --> 25:22.817
place or the other for supplies. The Milliken 
Railhead, or terminus, had him taken the place of

25:24.502 --> 25:30.469
the Port of Galveston. But the Civil War stopped it 
there. And they resumed construction on the

25:34.533 --> 25:41.902
railroad after the conclusion of the Civil War. I 
believe it reached Bryan in 1866.

25:46.487 --> 25:49.410
And Bryan was a terminus for a while. And then it 
moved, the railroad moved on and eventually

25:49.430 --> 25:53.935
terminated in Dallas. but is now Dallas. But from 
that time on, the town has been a very active sort of

25:57.475 --> 26:10.509
a town. And

26:10.929 --> 26:21.340
of course, the addition of the Texas A&M College 
obviously the most significant thing that really

26:22.973 --> 26:27.638
ever happened to it.

26:32.183 --> 26:38.390
Did you say that this, in the beginning, Bryan was a 
railroad town? It was a railroad terminal. It was

26:40.852 --> 26:52.845
not a railroad

26:40.852 --> 26:52.845
town in the sense that that's understood where 
many railroads meet or intersect or a railhead or

26:40.852 --> 26:52.845
anything like that. It was all of these towns were 
created by the railroad.

26:59.353 --> 27:02.816
As the railroad proceeded, they actually made the 
town. Many of the lots in Bryan are still owned by

27:02.996 --> 27:19.693
the Texas Town Lock Company, which was a, which is a 
subsidiary and part of the, let me see, what was it?

27:25.934 --> 27:28.337
was first the Houston and Texas Central. Then it 
was the Texas and New Orleans. And then it merged

27:34.246 --> 27:36.329
with Sun City. But the Texas Town Lock Company has 
been an operating identity

27:37.471 --> 27:51.972
since 1865

27:37.471 --> 27:51.972
or 66, right here in Brown. Do you think the 
railroad will ever come back?
