00:06.983 --> 00:12.468
We're about to begin an interview with Reverend 
William B. Rogers of Denton, Texas. It's April 6,

00:13.469 --> 00:36.012
1984, and we'll be discussing the Civil Rights 
Movement during the 1950s and early 60s,

00:13.469 --> 00:36.012
especially concerning Prince Edward County, 
where Reverend Rogers lived for several years.

00:36.329 --> 00:51.188
To begin, could you give a general background of 
your upbringing, where you were born, and just

00:36.329 --> 00:51.188
kind of a general view of leading into how you ended 
up in Prince Edward County? Well, this is very

00:51.208 --> 01:04.665
pertinent to the subject because there is a good 
bit of background here that leads up to a quite

00:51.208 --> 01:04.665
accidental presence in Prince Edward County at 
that particular time. But my background was very

01:05.354 --> 01:23.513
much in the civil rights movements of the old south 
long ago because my dad was one of the old school

01:05.354 --> 01:23.513
southern liberals lawyers in Arkansas. And he got 
into some real difficulties with the body politic

01:23.533 --> 01:31.581
and other things. He was a young assistant 
attorney general of the state at a time when a

01:31.780 --> 01:45.021
preliminary kind of Scottsboro case, if you're 
familiar with that, in Alabama, happened in

01:31.780 --> 01:45.021
Arkansas. And he was able to defuse this a good bit 
in his investigations and reports and so forth,

01:45.883 --> 01:57.822
and the refusal of the state to prosecute some 
blacks who were accused of rape. But as it turned

02:01.855 --> 02:04.939
out, money had changed hands. It was strictly an 
act of prostitution on the part of the white woman

02:04.959 --> 02:11.327
with the black men. But this was quite a lesson for 
my dad. This was back in the early 20s. He

02:18.677 --> 02:27.268
discovered in this case that he would never be able 
to stand for public office in Arkansas, which was

02:18.677 --> 02:27.268
his goal. because he had some real political 
ambitions. As it turned out, the Attorney

02:31.741 --> 02:44.700
General, who was the elected officer he was 
working with, was defeated the next time on the

02:31.741 --> 02:44.700
basis of his support of my dad. So there's a long 
history here, and a lot of the things in the

02:44.720 --> 02:51.349
political realm that my dad worked for. He was an 
ardent new dealer, for instance, when the time

02:54.635 --> 02:58.701
came. In fact, he was on Roosevelt's first list of 
federal judge appointees. He turned it down at the

03:05.130 --> 03:14.905
time because he said he couldn't feed his family on 
what the federal judge was paid in those days. But

03:14.925 --> 03:18.670
he, later on, in Little Rock and in El Dorado, he got 
the reputation of what was, he was called a nigger

03:19.426 --> 03:25.112
lawyer. And a nigger lawyer was somebody who would 
stand up for the blacks in the courts and often

03:25.132 --> 03:35.002
defend them and some of their difficulties and so 
forth. So this, there's a long tradition here in

03:35.022 --> 03:49.197
the South and in the Deep South as far as these 
things are concerned and I suppose I became pretty

03:35.022 --> 03:49.197
much an heir to my own heritage in and how this 
developed. In my first pastorate in Brooklyn,

03:53.343 --> 04:08.160
Brooklyn, New York, the church integrated for the 
first time in subsequent years with a pastor who

03:53.343 --> 04:08.160
moved in to stay following me. It's about a 50-50 
black and white church. The block had been busted

04:10.984 --> 04:18.913
while I was there, and we were able to reduce some of 
the barriers And, of course, when a block is busted

04:19.872 --> 04:29.293
in the city, this is a traumatic experience for the 
old blind whites who lived there and so forth. But

04:29.313 --> 04:39.535
this was in the central part of Brooklyn, and, of 
course, the blacks had pretty well taken over, or

04:29.313 --> 04:39.535
were taking over at that time. A real model, I 
think. I can't take any of the credit for it,

04:42.401 --> 04:53.942
because it's been the work of a white pastor in that 
situation who actively sought the blacks within

04:42.401 --> 04:53.942
the church. But at least I had a role in it starting, 
and I take some pride in that. But my next pastorate

05:01.115 --> 05:05.880
was in Prince Edward County. I was chaplain of 
Hampton-Sydney College and pastor of the college

05:06.341 --> 05:17.313
church, which was about half the college 
community, which was right out in the country. Of

05:17.353 --> 05:22.638
course, this was the seat back in 1776 when the 
college was founded. But the town moved seven

05:22.658 --> 05:29.586
miles away to Farmville, which is the county seat 
of Prince Edward County. And Hampton-Sydney

05:30.528 --> 05:37.077
College, the church was right in the middle of the 
college campus. Of course, it's a Presbyterian

05:37.178 --> 05:39.721
church-related college. And it was quite a 
challenge for a lot of ways. Now, Prince Edward

05:46.110 --> 05:52.840
County is about as deep south as you can find, even 
in places like Mississippi. It's Southside,

05:53.174 --> 05:55.016
Virginia. It has its traditions, its peculiar 
Virginia-type traditions. People like Patrick

06:00.344 --> 06:08.334
Henry and James Madison were natives of the

06:00.344 --> 06:08.334
county. It has quite a tradition. It's right next 
to Appomattox where the final surrender took

06:09.676 --> 06:14.903
place. The final battles actually took place in 
Prince Edward County where Lee's forces were

06:14.983 --> 06:22.253
retreating toward Appomattox. finally caught up 
with at that point. But there was an issue there

06:27.129 --> 06:31.533
from the very beginning. The quality of the 
schools, separate but equal so-called schools,

06:31.553 --> 06:40.122
in Prince Edward County were very poor. And the 
educational level of the blacks in that county was

06:41.464 --> 06:47.970
pretty low. In fact, some of the Some of the very 
dear white people who protested and were in the way

06:50.330 --> 07:12.972
of the integration of the schools simply had never 
known blacks who had more than a high school

06:50.330 --> 07:12.972
education. Now, of course, a high school 
education in Prince Edward County wasn't worth

07:12.992 --> 07:16.335
very much to the people who were graduating from 
Hartford. Of course, this had been a continuing

07:16.355 --> 07:19.999
problem with all black schools all the way 
through. So when the NAACP, Thurgood Marshall was

07:21.363 --> 07:30.572
the key person in all of this. He was the one who was 
working through the courts as a means for

07:30.592 --> 07:42.183
providing educational opportunity for black 
children. And incidentally, I'm a great admirer

07:42.203 --> 07:46.427
of Thurgood Marshall. I got to know him at that 
point. greatly admire some of the things he did. I

07:54.771 --> 07:57.315
haven't seen him more than on a couple of 
occasions. But he was the legal brain who pushed

07:57.335 --> 08:10.896
this thing through and saw this one legal point as a 
point of breakthrough for educational

07:57.335 --> 08:10.896
opportunity. There was another black lawyer 
named Hill from Richmond who was also involved in

08:10.916 --> 08:17.847
the NAACP. There's no question, but as the Whites 
and Prince Edward pointed out, that this was all

08:18.637 --> 08:30.091
agitated by outside agitators. But the caliber of 
those agitators was something else again. It was

08:35.698 --> 08:37.381
the NAACP. They saw in Prince Edward County and 
simultaneous with this, the other county, three

08:38.001 --> 08:48.154
other counties, I believe, Delaware and Kansas, 
South Carolina. they saw an opportunity for

08:48.556 --> 09:08.726
several cases to come before the Supreme Court at 
the same time and have a definitive decision on

08:48.556 --> 09:08.726
this subject to do away with the separate but 
equal, which was of course really unequal. So,

09:09.707 --> 09:13.112
there were meetings, some of the More educated 
blacks in the county were involved, and there were

09:13.514 --> 09:27.867
a very few of us whites, only two or three who were 
involved.

09:27.887 --> 09:31.710
I was in the only real educational center. There 
was another college in Farmerville, a woman's

09:31.730 --> 09:42.340
college, but Hampton-Sydney was very much a 
traditional Virginia-type institution. almost

09:42.995 --> 09:48.546
a small Ivy League-type school. The students 
there were largely rural Virginia, conservative

09:49.488 --> 10:01.172
in background, but yet of the first families in 
this kind of land. And all the way through, the

10:01.844 --> 10:08.430
issues that remained, I was never able to rally 
much support from the students there. This was

10:08.451 --> 10:28.290
before the days of student activism, and I 
despaired of students ever being useful or

10:08.451 --> 10:28.290
involved in anything that might

10:08.451 --> 10:28.290
mean some progress as far as educational 
opportunities and others were concerned. But

10:30.177 --> 10:34.563
this ran through the course in the county here. It 
wasn't an issue to a lot of people. It was just an

10:37.828 --> 10:46.801
issue to those of us who were interested in it until 
it came as one of the suits before the Supreme

10:37.828 --> 10:46.801
Court. One of the incidents I remember 
particularly in this, I had taken a stand from the

10:46.921 --> 10:53.451
pulpit and I had written a letter or two to the local 
paper just as sort of a general thing of support it

10:54.072 --> 11:23.792
wasn't anything radical or anything that even got 
me ostracized in the community at this point but

10:54.072 --> 11:23.792
this was at the time that the oral arguments were 
being made before the Supreme Court and there was a

10:54.072 --> 11:23.792
very sweet old gentleman he must have been in his 
70s at that time named McElwain He was the attorney

11:24.211 --> 11:34.731
for the school board who was resisting this suit by 
the NAACP and of course the local blacks. And he was

11:34.751 --> 11:45.612
reporting to the Lions Club immediately after he 
came back from this oral, the oral arguments

11:34.751 --> 11:45.612
before the Supreme Court. And it didn't occur to 
anybody in that Lions Club that there might be some

11:46.351 --> 11:56.889
support in the white community for the blacks in 
this case. And I tried to be very discreet, and

11:58.071 --> 12:03.361
certainly I respected Mr. McElwain. I didn't want 
to challenge him, but I asked some fairly sharp

12:03.541 --> 12:08.730
questions of him. And that was the end of my 
relationship to the Lions Club in Prince Edward

12:09.824 --> 12:15.813
County. He was, of course, he had been involved in 
this all the way through. He had a brother who was a

12:20.399 --> 12:27.189
Presbyterian missionary in Japan, and I 
respected him and I respected the family. But

12:27.249 --> 12:39.426
when the actual decision was made by the Supreme 
Court, there was complete shock and dismay in the

12:27.249 --> 12:39.426
county And then, of course, is when my role in this, 
as limited and remote as it was, I had no real role at

12:40.047 --> 12:52.495
all except within the white community. And this 
was a very negative role because my position was

12:52.516 --> 12:57.988
never accepted. There were two issues in the 
church at that time. One was the reunion of the two

13:02.135 --> 13:15.050
branches of the Presbyterian Church, which was 
defeated at that General Assembly, which came

13:02.135 --> 13:15.050
immediately after the cause, primarily, of this 
integration decision. And then this question of

13:15.070 --> 13:18.473
the integration of the schools. And I took my side, 
the liberal side of both. I was commissioner to

13:24.175 --> 13:26.858
that General Assembly. That was in Montreat, 
North Carolina? Well, it often is and has been in

13:28.700 --> 13:31.604
Montreat. It was in Atlanta at this particular 
time. But at that General Assembly, I got a

13:35.648 --> 13:52.528
petition from about 90% of the elders of that 
Presbytery, West Hanover Presbytery, which was

13:35.648 --> 13:52.528
the region west of Richmond over to Lynchburg. 
asking me two things. There was a resolution

13:57.355 --> 14:11.895
concerning integration before General Assembly 
asking me to oppose integration at the General

13:57.355 --> 14:11.895
Assembly and asking me to oppose the reunion of the 
two churches. Well, I couldn't do that in

14:11.915 --> 14:15.580
conscience. are in the pulpit or anywhere else. So 
I wrote a letter and mimeographed it and sent it to

14:19.408 --> 14:34.604
all of those elders who had signed this petition 
from all of the churches, including out of 12 out of

14:19.408 --> 14:34.604
13 of my elders in the section. And that's when it 
really hit the fan. Because What I was saying was

14:41.902 --> 14:58.218
that the gospel couldn't be preached by popular 
vote, and that I had to vote my conscience on this,

14:41.902 --> 14:58.218
as I believe my conscience was enlightened by 
Scripture. Well, from that point, it was just a

14:58.238 --> 15:07.106
question of how long I could remain

14:58.238 --> 15:07.106
in the community. It was a traumatic experience, 
because I loved those people. good, solid people,

15:12.344 --> 15:17.669
but they were just living in a different age. And it 
was just incomprehensible that black children

15:17.689 --> 15:34.106
could go to school with the white children in the 
little worship school, which was nearby, and all

15:17.689 --> 15:34.106
the children and the professors went there. And it 
was just beyond, they couldn't accept it. One of

15:38.010 --> 15:38.470
the real stories here, and it was a personal story, 
and one of friendship, and I believe mutual

15:39.260 --> 15:48.058
respect. There was an old doctor in the 
congregation. He was pushing 80, but everybody

15:51.445 --> 15:55.493
there was old. This was one of the problems. The 
average age of my session was 70. But this old

16:00.623 --> 16:11.353
doctor, Dr. Moore, he was the old family doctor for 
all of the people in the area. But most of his

16:11.373 --> 16:15.397
practice was with blacks. And he was a devoted 
person in terms of his Christian vocation and his

16:15.417 --> 16:26.206
desire to help people and so forth. But he lived in 
another age. He was a staunch segregationist. And

16:30.965 --> 16:39.237
he was the one, this was such a traumatic thing for 
the people in the church, they couldn't even talk

16:30.965 --> 16:39.237
to me about it. But old Dr. Moore was one who would 
talk to me. And after a church service in which I may

16:42.922 --> 16:53.817
have made some reference, or in some cases devoted 
services to issues of this kind, everybody else

16:42.922 --> 16:53.817
would, I wouldn't even speak to him, but he would 
argue with me, and many a time there had been Sunday

16:55.687 --> 17:04.080
dinners waiting two or three hours as we would have 
it out. But, you see, the difficulty was with the

17:05.062 --> 17:12.413
position that I took, I couldn't really challenge 
on moral grounds the argument of a man like Dr.

17:13.102 --> 17:28.041
Moore because he provided the only medical 
services available to most of the blacks in the

17:13.102 --> 17:28.041
south half of Prince Edward County. Many a time 
I've seen that man, as old and firm as he was, come in

17:28.061 --> 17:35.430
at dawn because he had to go right by our house as he 
went out to this rural area and he was serving the

17:35.731 --> 18:01.840
blacks either death or birth or an acute illness 
and he was the kind of doctor who would be there and

17:35.731 --> 18:01.840
see it through but with all of his service and all of 
his idea of using his services, Christian

18:02.427 --> 18:05.151
vocation. He was a segregationist. This is the 
incongruity in the situation. Of course, he was,

18:11.120 --> 18:17.750
this was paternalism in the traditional Southern 
fashion. To be nice to them, do everything you can

18:17.770 --> 18:26.022
to help them and so forth, even help their school 
situation. But still, everything was still in the

18:26.643 --> 18:36.476
control of the whites, and it was sort of a paternal 
looking out after their interests, and so forth.

18:36.496 --> 18:47.470
And this was the whole community, but it was 
particularly Dr. Moore, and as I say, I admired and

18:36.496 --> 18:47.470
respected him. I think there was a lot of mutual 
admiration and respect in that community, but the

18:47.905 --> 19:00.062
point came when it was no longer possible to carry 
on an effective ministry there. And what little

19:00.082 --> 19:06.932
support, I did have some support from the 
students, but it was not an outspoken support. It

19:06.952 --> 19:12.700
was sort of a private thing.

19:12.720 --> 19:16.545
We're with you, Mr. Bill, or we're... We agree with 
you, but we can't go home and say this. And most of

19:21.449 --> 19:27.475
them were from rural or small towns in Virginia. 
But at any rate, it hit close home a lot of other

19:27.495 --> 19:34.022
ways, too. I have a pretty thick eye. I mean, I can 
endure this kind of situation up to a point, though

19:35.563 --> 19:41.850
it hurt. But Agnes doesn't. And she had a very 
strong

19:44.082 --> 19:50.751
reaction to some of this. And for her mental health

19:50.771 --> 20:01.705
and other reasons, we had to leave. First it was to 
go on, and then I was wrapping up my doctoral work at

20:01.725 --> 20:03.327
that time. So we resigned. I simply went to 
Richmond, and we were there for, oh, for three more

20:04.309 --> 20:11.338
months. that summer and then I was given a look out 
for something else. That's how we became Texans,

20:16.435 --> 20:26.054
because it was not possible after that experience 
to go back to the Deep South. But at any rate, this

20:26.074 --> 20:30.703
was more a personal thing. Now, as far as the the 
actual litigation is concerned, I had no part in

20:34.201 --> 20:38.612
that whatsoever. I simply met on very few 
occasions with some of the people who had the same

20:38.632 --> 20:45.510
kind of concerns that I did. and was able at least to 
demonstrate that there was some white support for

20:46.030 --> 20:55.551
the things that they were trying to achieve. 
Thurgood Marshall came down, and is that where you

20:55.571 --> 20:58.798
met him? Yes, yes, this is where I met him. He was in 
New York also. Yes, well, yes, that was his base,

21:01.383 --> 21:06.013
but he visited, I think, All four or five, some of 
them didn't really get to this, but there were a

21:05.993 --> 21:28.255
number of challenges, legal challenges, that 
were made in the courts, both in the North and in the

21:05.993 --> 21:28.255
South, so that this could come before the Supreme 
Court as a fundamental legal issue that could be

21:05.993 --> 21:28.255
decided once and for all. And he was the real 
architect of this whole structure. I mean, his

21:36.031 --> 21:55.756
whole point was this one unconstitutional point, 
the separate but equal, which obviously, as it was

21:36.031 --> 21:55.756
practiced and carried out both in the North and the 
South, was both unequal. Well, it was separate,

21:55.776 --> 21:57.398
but it was unequal. There was no possible equality 
on the basis of a separate school system, I

21:57.648 --> 22:06.291
suppose. There was real consternation in Prince 
Edward County, and I have an idea that what you've

22:06.811 --> 22:21.733
seen in the New York Times dealt primarily with the 
abolition of the public schools in Prince Edward

22:06.811 --> 22:21.733
County, which came after that. Actually, it came, 
this was in the words, in fact, this is what they had

22:21.753 --> 22:33.190
been saying, threatening all along, that if 
this... and of course it went through the

22:33.997 --> 22:40.725
appellate courts and up to the Supreme Court and 
was won all the way. But if this was sustained by the

22:41.586 --> 22:49.435
Supreme Court, Prince Edward County had no choice 
but to abolish public schools. And of course what

22:49.455 --> 22:58.346
that meant was, and it was very obvious to everyone 
who was involved here, there would be no schooling

22:49.455 --> 22:58.346
for the blacks. The whites would organize their 
own private schools. And the only way to get any

23:02.296 --> 23:11.945
kind of education at all for children was to enroll 
in these private schools. So there was a great deal

23:11.965 --> 23:18.292
of scurrying about and organizing the private 
school system. And then the year that I left, the

23:18.312 --> 23:25.038
county abolished the public school system. And 
what that meant was that even The limited schools

23:29.532 --> 23:48.013
that they had were not available anymore. And for 
about five or six years, there was no public school

23:48.033 --> 23:50.796
in Prince Edward County at all. Now, eventually, 
they were forced by court order to reopen the

23:50.816 --> 23:52.418
public schools. But it was too late for a lot

23:53.427 --> 24:01.203
of the kids who grew up without any schooling 
whatsoever. And then when the school resumed, it

24:01.223 --> 24:07.736
was, well, there was consternation.

24:07.756 --> 24:11.183
It was chaos in the public schools that were 
reordering it. And not really until now has it

24:12.023 --> 24:15.227
settled down. Now, there's still a private school 
system, but I think most whites, particularly in

24:15.447 --> 24:36.673
academic communities like Hampton-Sydney and 
Longwood, out of principle, they send their

24:15.447 --> 24:36.673
children to public school, but with some 
supplementary schooling and so forth. And maybe

24:36.693 --> 24:39.837
they use the private schools in part There are a lot 
of difficult issues and questions here. Of

24:44.462 --> 24:55.434
course, the fact that a large majority of people in 
Prince Edward County, particularly school age,

24:44.462 --> 24:55.434
are black is a factor here. But I've often thought 
in subsequent years how that might have been

24:55.454 --> 25:06.727
handled in a better way. Of course, there had to be 
confrontation. in order for, had to be legal

25:09.601 --> 25:19.195
confrontation, in order for things to be done that 
were actually accomplished. But in terms of the

25:19.215 --> 25:25.984
church and its role, I don't know. I think I would 
have done things differently. I think I would have

25:31.693 --> 25:33.615
been, I would have taken my stand. I had to do that. 
But I think I would have been less abrasive about

25:37.580 --> 25:48.256
it, or at least abrasive in terms of the old 
paternal society

25:37.580 --> 25:48.256
in Prince Edward County. I was an outsider, you 
see. One of the funny things, I had a friend who was

25:52.822 --> 25:57.529
presiding at the congregational meeting when I 
was called, And he swears up and down that the first

25:58.066 --> 26:06.790
15 minutes of reporting on me, they were reporting 
on my wife's family. Agnes' father was a graduate

26:06.810 --> 26:09.257
of Agnes. and the family was very much a part of that 
Virginia tradition and so forth. But I was this

26:14.352 --> 26:23.724
Arkansan interloper who was acceptable on the 
basis of my wife's family. But no, there were real

26:23.744 --> 26:34.958
personal times and it was really an anguishing 
experience for all of us because we were close. And

26:35.933 --> 26:48.632
I think there

26:35.933 --> 26:48.632
was a great deal of acceptance of what I was trying 
to get across as a pastor there. Yet, there can be

26:48.652 --> 26:49.494
only partial acceptance. And it was a source of 
great distress to

26:49.514 --> 26:57.145
a lot of people. And I felt

26:57.265 --> 27:01.953
that I had to go and stay and find a job. I think I 
would have, except for the kind of pressures that

27:01.973 --> 27:03.595
we had with children. That kind of pressure she

27:04.958 --> 27:11.546
put on me was too much in that kind of situation. 
She's the one who got the personal brunt of it, you

27:11.566 --> 27:14.710
see. I can sort of live up on this plane and take my 
stand. I can do no other, this kind of thing. But on a

27:22.720 --> 27:30.469
personal level,

27:22.720 --> 27:30.469
it was very difficult. Well, we came on. to the 
campus ministry here at North Texas and at TWU and

27:32.228 --> 27:40.200
taught in both institutions. And the same issue 
followed me right here because the first thing

27:40.260 --> 27:57.747
that happened here at North Texas was court 
integration of North Texas State University, the

27:40.260 --> 27:57.747
first institution in Texas, or at least public 
institution, that decreed integration. Well, we

27:58.688 --> 28:02.553
were prepared for it. And in those days, this was 
days of the large, many students were involved in

28:02.573 --> 28:10.563
student movements. Quite a different situation 
in Sydney because students became involved right

28:10.583 --> 28:17.993
at the beginning. Our Presbyterian group, which 
was really as much an ecumenical group as anything

28:18.013 --> 28:27.345
else, integrated rather massively from the 
start. And the kids would picket the campus

28:27.646 --> 28:31.050
theater. We would continue to be, at least for a 
while. You see, the community was still

28:35.014 --> 28:43.743
segregated in Denton, but the North Texas was 
integrated. Really, it was a very wise policy of

28:43.763 --> 28:50.710
Dr. Matthews, the president at that time. He was 
trying to keep the publicity down to a minimum. and

28:54.123 --> 28:58.190
yet to make everything internally, make the 
things work. And so, there were a lot of

28:59.512 --> 29:05.321
interesting situations there. For instance, one 
thing our group did was to integrate Austin

29:06.523 --> 29:11.612
College up here. We had, our kids were going up 
there, it was some kind of weekend college rally.

29:18.254 --> 29:23.299
And we had four black kids who signed up to go. So I 
called up Ashby Johnson, who was a chaplain of

29:23.319 --> 29:32.868
Austin College at that time, a good friend, and 
said, we're going to integrate your college.

29:35.571 --> 29:41.117
And he was completely sympathetic with us. I mean, 
he said the time had come, and he was just hoping for

29:41.137 --> 29:47.603
an occasion where things simply could go on and 
happen. It was done, and no fuss and fanfare about

29:50.834 --> 29:55.960
it. And as it turned out, there were some other 
things happening back here. Only one black girl

30:00.045 --> 30:05.291
went with our group. We had about eight or ten 
there. It went smoothly, no problems, and As far as

30:11.613 --> 30:22.750
Austin College was concerned, it had already 
happened, you see, because there were

30:11.613 --> 30:22.750
progressive people in charge of things then. But 
it was rather interesting that it was our group

30:22.770 --> 30:28.479
that posed the issue. And, of course, my warning 
Ashby Johnson in advance of what was happening

30:28.499 --> 30:40.017
helped him to prepare for it and to make sure that 
there were no incidents and this kind of thing. But

30:40.452 --> 30:52.507
the black gal who went up there had a wonderful 
time, and it was a happy occasion for all, and so we

30:40.452 --> 30:52.507
were real pleased with that. But North Texas 
really pioneered this situation in Texas as far as

30:52.528 --> 31:04.603
the public schools were concerned. I give Dr. 
Matthews, who was president at that time, great

31:06.473 --> 31:15.387
credit for the way he handled it. You see, when the 
blacks came in to North Texas,

31:15.407 --> 31:28.829
it was on a massive basis. I think about 400. Many of 
the graduate students came in at the same time. One

31:30.411 --> 31:32.835
of the funny things that happened along with his 
first integrated class, who were a number of

31:35.228 --> 31:44.757
football players, some basketball players. And 
in this first group was little Abner Haynes, who

31:44.777 --> 31:54.366
was a terrific hatback, slickest running hatback 
I think I'd ever seen up to that point. And as soon as

31:54.386 --> 32:02.434
he was in his first game as a freshman, integration 
was suddenly enthusiastic. I think that really

32:03.190 --> 32:15.126
made it a lot easier, because Little Abner, and 
there were a couple of others, and then about three

32:03.190 --> 32:15.126
or four years later, Mean Joe Green came in. And so 
that took care of it. But you know, I was real

32:18.351 --> 32:20.714
interested. It was also the time of Oscar 
Robertson in Cincinnati. And Cincinnati and

32:25.941 --> 32:31.088
North Texas were in the same conference at that 
time. And in the old gym,

32:31.473 --> 32:50.246
we went

32:31.473 --> 32:50.246
to a game, and Oscar Robertson and two or three 
other blacks were on the Cincinnati team. And I

32:50.266 --> 32:52.630
think North Texas at that time had one or two black 
players, but they were not prominent players.

32:52.650 --> 32:53.852
They were just on the team, I think, when I got in the 
game. But when Oscar Robertson came to town, of

32:55.570 --> 33:07.530
course he was the drawing card for Blacks and Pikes 
Alive, I noticed that every black student at North

32:55.570 --> 33:07.530
Texas was at that game. And I was wondering there 
whether they had come to cheer for Oscar Robertson

33:08.391 --> 33:18.769
because he was a celebrity, he was the great 
player. And the thing that that impressed me or

33:20.680 --> 33:29.072
convinced me that integration was really a 
success at North Texas is when those black

33:20.680 --> 33:29.072
students were cheering for North Texas. I mean, 
they came to see Oscar Robertson. They had great

33:31.996 --> 33:40.489
admiration and respect for that kind of a 
building, but they were cheering their own team.

33:40.529 --> 33:42.672
They were a part of the North Texas situation, even 
though very limited participation by black

33:42.871 --> 33:53.047
students and by black basketball players. At that 
time, of course, things have completely changed

33:53.067 --> 33:57.273
since then. It's mostly black now, everywhere, as 
far as basketball is concerned. But those have

34:03.503 --> 34:06.027
been some of the experiences, and North Texas was 
very much in the fan of integration. When it first

34:16.451 --> 34:35.794
happened, I was reading in Time Magazine 
something about how there was no, there were no

34:16.451 --> 34:35.794
black students in white colleges in the 
Dallas-Fort Worth area, and no public ones in all

34:16.451 --> 34:35.794
of Texas. And there were 400-odd in North Texas at 
that time. But this is how much Dr. Matthews had

34:40.097 --> 34:49.148
been able to keep it quiet until it was a success, 
and then it was published. But that was just sort of

34:49.488 --> 35:04.465
a funny sidelight that, of course, Time and New 
York Times and others were reporting on these

34:49.488 --> 35:04.465
things for several years after the Brown Supreme 
Court decision in 1954. But it's come a long way.

35:10.045 --> 35:19.954
Well, this, my whole career, if you could call it 
that, has been dominated by this issue. Not by

35:19.974 --> 35:21.616
choice, necessarily. I just happen to be in the 
places where it happened. And having certain

35:27.121 --> 35:35.008
convictions and being all a little bit 
confrontational about and so forth,

35:35.528 --> 35:44.901
I guess I've been involved more directly than some 
other ministers. Most of them shared the

35:44.921 --> 36:00.683
convictions that I've had, they just haven't been 
quite as outspoken or vocal about it, or haven't

35:44.921 --> 36:00.683
been placed in the situations where they had to 
make decisions of this kind. So when I was on the

36:00.703 --> 36:05.350
staff of the National Council of Churches, The 
question was raised, and this was the higher

36:06.747 --> 36:12.595
education staff. At that time, I was director of 
Faculty of Christian Fellowship, which was the

36:12.615 --> 36:25.691
Christian faculty group in the country, 
ecumenical groups, all the denominations. And we

36:25.992 --> 36:30.598
were beginning to raise some questions. There 
were a good many people who were concerned about

36:31.279 --> 36:36.265
this, with the progression of immigration, and 
the opportunities for black students broadening

36:37.207 --> 36:46.176
into the predominantly white higher educational 
institutions. The black institutions, all black

36:46.196 --> 37:01.411
institutions, traditional, primarily 
church-related institutions and state ones,

36:46.196 --> 37:01.411
were more and more getting into the backwaters. 
They were being bypassed. Most of them seemed to be

37:05.455 --> 37:19.473
with the most progressive blacks, so those with 
the best training in the public schools and so

37:05.455 --> 37:19.473
forth going on to integrated institutions. It was 
more a matter of remedial training in some of these

37:19.493 --> 37:26.402
backwater black institutions. So there were a 
number of conferences

37:30.751 --> 37:54.977
involving all the boards and agencies of the 
predominantly white denominations that had

37:30.751 --> 37:54.977
sponsored these schools and also the black 
denominations that had had these at the very core

37:30.751 --> 37:54.977
of their being for many years because these black 
colleges were tremendously important to the

37:30.751 --> 37:54.977
blacks. In fact, I would say the only two 
indigenous black institutions for the church and

38:00.788 --> 38:02.990
the black college. And as a result of these 
consultations, and this came out of the National

38:04.732 --> 38:27.893
Council of the Churches primarily, the decision 
was made that these indigenous institutions in

38:04.732 --> 38:27.893
the black community needed to be supported and 
brought up to date and brought into the the

38:28.767 --> 38:56.412
academic view, and so forth, to a much more extent, 
which meant going to foundations, increasing

38:28.767 --> 38:56.412
church support, trying to sponsor government 
programs to particularly to support this type of

38:28.767 --> 38:56.412
institution to go out on all fronts and to try to 
strengthen these colleges, to integrate them, as

38:28.767 --> 38:56.412
was indicated by still to maintain basically 
their control and the black control over these

38:57.033 --> 39:04.880
institutions. Of course, in many cases, it was 
white nations in control. But at any rate, to

39:09.724 --> 39:18.332
emphasize the fact that this is an indigenous 
black institution and that it has merit on its own.

39:18.712 --> 39:24.998
It may not be able to attract the best black 
students in the future, but there's still a role

39:26.159 --> 39:28.482
for him. I think one thing that, I won't forget the 
name, he was president of Fisk College in

39:28.502 --> 39:40.960
Nashville, which was a very fine black 
institution. But he was saying that what the, he

39:40.980 --> 39:49.753
was talking about Ivy League institutions and 
other They said, what these institutions are

39:50.189 --> 39:59.180
looking for primarily is the top 5% in 100 million 
pound handbags. And that was exactly true. You

40:00.481 --> 40:04.466
see, the Ivy League was trying to skim off the cream 
of the crop. Well, what do you do with all the rest of

40:05.487 --> 40:07.770
them? I mean, they have to have educational 
opportunities, even if there has to be a lot of

40:07.790 --> 40:19.183
remedial work to bring them to the level of the 
college degree. So I was assigned at that time by

40:20.513 --> 40:29.868
these consultations and this group. It became a 
regular structure in the National Council of

40:29.888 --> 40:48.377
Churches to try to develop a program on all of these 
fronts that we were working on at that time to

40:29.888 --> 40:48.377
strengthen these colleges The first thing I did 
was to visit everyone and talk to their presidents

40:49.302 --> 41:06.387
and their boards whenever possible, professors, 
and to make friendships and to see what might be

40:49.302 --> 41:06.387
done here. And of course, it was a tremendously 
enlightening experience to me. I had always

41:13.177 --> 41:15.360
thought of myself as being very sympathetic to the 
blacks concerns and being a southerner myself I

41:16.218 --> 41:44.858
understood some of the mores hopefully from the 
black perspective as well as the white and so forth

41:16.218 --> 41:44.858
but I learned lots of new things one of the things at 
the beginning I would get this I would be trying to

41:16.218 --> 41:44.858
get some to understand something about how things 
were done or what the power structure is in this

41:45.175 --> 41:48.449
particular school. And some of these guys were 
telling me, say, Bill, You don't understand the

41:53.731 --> 41:56.454
mores. You can't think like a black or something 
like that. Now, the particular issue in this case,

42:01.520 --> 42:10.610
I was trying to find out who really ran Paul Quinn 
College in Waco, Texas. Now, it was traditionally

42:11.551 --> 42:16.276
the bishop who lived right next to the campus. But 
in this case, the bishop was 85 years old and was . I

42:19.760 --> 42:22.523
mean, he was just the figurehead. Well, I knew the 
president of the college. He wasn't even a

42:25.062 --> 42:32.691
minister, and you almost had to be a minister to be 
in a power situation. I knew he wasn't the... And so

42:32.711 --> 42:41.702
I was trying to find just who was running that 
college. I never did find out. I think it was the

42:44.926 --> 42:49.432
bishop's secretary. It was... Well, they didn't 
call him a secretary. He was a minister, and he was

42:54.494 --> 43:01.401
the bishop's administrator or something like 
that. But I never did get to him. That was the thing.

43:04.925 --> 43:10.510
I couldn't really talk to him about these programs 
and so on. But at any rate, they would say, Bill, you

43:10.530 --> 43:16.236
don't understand the nuances of this situation. 
And the nuance was, who was boss? I mean, who was

43:19.479 --> 43:20.640
really boss? So I got into lots of situations like 
that, and I was accepted. But I was working with

43:27.730 --> 43:34.059
them and trying to do things. Well, what we finally 
did, and this was with the help of the Ford

43:34.079 --> 43:48.838
Foundation primarily, I found an administrator, 
a staff person at the Ford Foundation who was

43:34.079 --> 43:48.838
really interested in going ahead with this thing. 
So he made a grant to our National Council office,

43:49.882 --> 44:09.070
really it was just a grant to take care of the 
structure and the meetings and my salary and

43:49.882 --> 44:09.070
things like this for a couple of years while we 
tried to develop something. And then, one of the,

44:09.090 --> 44:13.476
of course we were working, all of the people in 
political power in the black community at that

44:13.793 --> 44:21.664
time. Now this was beginning Lyndon Johnson's 
administration.

44:26.610 --> 44:39.988
Civil rights measures were being passed and this 
whole business of special grants for black

44:26.610 --> 44:39.988
institutions.

44:40.289 --> 44:41.370
It was no, it was equality, presumably, but it was, 
no, it wasn't equality, it was the affirmative

44:41.941 --> 44:56.761
action and over and above grants for those because 
of the minority background and so forth. It's

44:56.781 --> 45:11.762
pretty well gone by the boards now, but there was a 
lot of idealism in those days, and special

44:56.781 --> 45:11.762
programs were set up specifically between black 
colleges

44:56.781 --> 45:11.762
from health education, welfare, and GW. I spent a 
good bit of time in Washington trying to work

45:12.603 --> 45:20.672
through some of these things with black 
presidents. Benny Mays, who was the head of

45:20.692 --> 45:33.446
Morehouse College, I think he was already 
retired, but he was, I guess, the most respected

45:20.692 --> 45:33.446
black

45:20.692 --> 45:33.446
figure in education at that time. He was helpful, 
and this president of Fisk, and oh, a number of

45:33.466 --> 45:38.812
others. There were some great men involved. in 
that area, but I was a sort of an operator working in

45:42.269 --> 45:59.347
and out using the influence of black educators and 
making proposals and so forth. And one of the

45:59.367 --> 46:11.179
things we did was to try to set up the consortium 
idea among the black colleges, that is to allow

46:11.716 --> 46:16.601
regional areas of the black colleges.

46:17.782 --> 46:30.414
Because a lot of these programs, academic 
programs we were proposing, no one college was big

46:17.782 --> 46:30.414
enough or strong enough really to do it, even with 
the influx of a lot of money. They were too small and

46:30.634 --> 46:33.997
too weak to do that. But we figured that on the basis 
of a consortium, we could go pretty far. in, say,

46:40.893 --> 46:51.831
putting one good business program in a consortium 
of several colleges.
