WEBVTT

00:10.713 --> 00:14.878
And so in each case, the students then live right by 
the buildings themselves. Right. And they have

00:16.220 --> 00:21.847
most of their informal student life in their 
college, not all of it alone. The cafeteria, the

00:21.867 --> 00:31.258
lounges, the ice cream parlors, the bookstore, 
and so forth.

00:31.279 --> 00:32.160
The sundry store.

00:35.263 --> 00:38.948
One thing that hasn't worked out is the ratio of 
undergraduates to graduates. mostly

00:39.856 --> 00:47.646
undergraduates, only about 1,500 graduates.

00:47.686 --> 00:54.495
That's including the medical school inscription 
institution.

00:54.515 --> 01:05.108
And I don't know quite why that is, but

00:54.515 --> 01:05.108
it has...

00:54.515 --> 01:05.108
Well, certainly one powerful reason is the lack of 
academic jobs.

01:08.973 --> 01:09.694
Another is that They just don't have money to 
support them. Traditionally, you should support

01:14.184 --> 01:16.706
all your graduate students. They don't have 
enough teaching assistantships or enough

01:18.648 --> 01:27.658
research assistantships to support any more 
graduate

01:18.648 --> 01:27.658
students. But maybe there's something more 
fundamental. I won't even back it. I've been away

01:30.481 --> 01:32.102
12 years. I've only been back a few months. And I'm a 
slow learner. And I don't really understand

01:35.866 --> 01:37.588
what's happening.

01:42.833 --> 02:08.503
The other thing which I guess bothers me

01:42.833 --> 02:08.503
is that the collegiate spirit, the collegial 
spirit which is so characteristic of Harvard,

01:42.833 --> 02:08.503
where the tradition is that all faculty members 
help each other out, doesn't exist here.

02:11.352 --> 02:17.779
faculty members do help each other out in the sense 
that if I have to go on a trip, somebody will take my

02:11.352 --> 02:17.779
class.

02:21.763 --> 02:32.854
Sort of like a mother cow, take care of other 
people's, other cows' calves, as long as he

02:21.763 --> 02:32.854
doesn't have to nurse

02:21.763 --> 02:32.854
them. But the life of the, the intellectual life

02:41.322 --> 02:48.870
of intellectual interchange between different 
parts of the university that I don't think exists

02:41.322 --> 02:48.870
very much.

02:51.833 --> 02:53.495
It's more like Berkeley than it is like Harvard.

02:56.918 --> 02:57.779
I don't know why that is. There are some faculty 
members who are enthusiastic about increasing

03:00.442 --> 03:09.051
and improving intellectual and social 
interchange. These are dedicated, idealistic

03:10.313 --> 03:12.956
type guys. And they include the chancellor. The 
chancellor himself doesn't, he's a pretty remote

03:17.482 --> 03:21.387
figure.

03:26.074 --> 03:37.148
And I think if I were a chancellor, I'd spend

03:26.074 --> 03:37.148
at least 50% of my time wandering around the 
universe and talking to people, as I used to do when

03:26.074 --> 03:37.148
I was director of scripts. which I learned from 
Columbus Islin, who preceded me as director of

03:39.254 --> 03:45.362
Woods Hole by about 10 years.

03:48.186 --> 03:57.378
I more or less patterned myself after him in terms 
of how I behaved with members of the staff. Always

03:57.398 --> 04:05.468
trying to find out what people were doing and why 
they were doing it and being more interested in

03:57.398 --> 04:05.468
what they were doing than anybody else. And I was 
talking to them that they were the chief guy in the

04:05.488 --> 04:08.232
world. It was very important to me. Yeah. Do you 
think Scripps has grown too large?

04:24.966 --> 04:25.366
I don't know. What do you think? I don't know. I just 
wonder. I wonder if there's an optimal place where

04:28.189 --> 04:34.597
an institution or a university becomes so large 
it's difficult to have an interchange of ideas.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.282
Well, I'll tell you one thing. This is 
discouraging to me. I was reading about it in the

04:42.087 --> 04:48.874
minutes of the script staff meeting. When I was a 
graduate student, it was traditional that we had a

04:48.894 --> 05:04.150
staff lunch once a week, where somebody would talk 
about his research.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.653
And Sperger kept that up, and I kept it up.

05:11.510 --> 05:12.792
And I always went myself.

05:15.675 --> 05:20.140
And sort of made it quite clear that this is what 
everybody's supposed to do. This custom has gone

05:21.802 --> 05:28.330
into abeyance the last four or five years. They 
tried to revive it this year. And

05:29.972 --> 05:41.145
as a result of a questionnaire they sent around to 
the staff, about 100 people responded saying they

05:29.972 --> 05:41.145
wanted to have it discontinued. But only 10 to 50 of 
them ever showed up. So they've abandoned it

05:47.420 --> 05:51.926
again, which suggests to me that the place is too 
large. Why did you stop teaching full time? Well,

05:57.253 --> 05:58.374
I'm 67 years old. I'm not teaching full time. But 
I'm teaching in two places. You mean stop teaching

06:02.978 --> 06:04.641
full-time? Well, I all of a sudden see you drifting 
more and more into administration. This is the

06:08.988 --> 06:11.071
sort of picture, maybe an erroneous picture. You 
mean long ago? Long ago, while you were at Scripps.

06:14.277 --> 06:21.088
I see you all of a sudden director of two 
institutions almost simultaneously, Scripps

06:14.277 --> 06:21.088
and the University of California at La Jolla. And I 
wondered if that didn't eliminate you teaching,

06:21.108 --> 06:28.480
and what was your reaction to that personally when 
that occurred?

06:31.177 --> 06:35.542
I didn't mind it, but I was creating something. I'm 
a good guy at beginning

06:35.582 --> 06:46.415
things, not necessarily a good guy at managing 
them after they've gone. And what I was doing was

06:46.655 --> 07:01.032
transforming the Scripps Institution from a 
small, locally-oriented

06:46.655 --> 07:01.032
laboratory to a world-exploring

07:08.403 --> 07:15.852
multidisciplinary

07:08.403 --> 07:15.852
activity. And we ended up in 12 shifts when I was, 
the last year I was director. Would you estimate

07:23.060 --> 07:34.413
that to be your major accomplishment while 
director of scripts, changing scripts from a

07:23.060 --> 07:34.413
localized institution to, may I call it a 
multiversity, that's the wrong choice of words. I

07:34.493 --> 07:37.617
wouldn't use that word at all. It became a world 
institution, concerned with the whole ocean, not

07:38.491 --> 07:45.720
just with the water that all of a sudden fell. One 
way, if I had an epitaph as director of Scripps, I

07:46.461 --> 07:52.729
would say, he sent Scripps to sea.

07:56.594 --> 08:06.186
Sort of like, I did the same thing at Scripps in 
some, I hope you won't think this is an egocentric

07:56.594 --> 08:06.186
comparison, but it illustrates what I'm talking 
about. I did the same thing at Scripps that Prince

08:06.250 --> 08:10.657
Henry the Navigator did for Portugal. I made it a 
world country instead of a little tit on the

08:11.479 --> 08:16.427
Iberian Peninsula. I might add you chose the same 
words too, age of exploration, when you described

08:17.488 --> 08:27.545
what you thought the activities ought to be in the 
periods of the 17th century vis-a-vis the 1950s.

08:27.965 --> 08:28.967
Was that deliberate? How's that? I'm sorry. Well, 
I'm saying that you and Prince Henry, in effect,

08:31.353 --> 08:34.101
chose the same words. He says age of exploration 
when he talks about his 17th century. And you say

08:37.952 --> 08:40.780
age of exploration, in effect, when you talk about 
about your century. You're talking about Prince

08:42.853 --> 08:44.416
Henry the Navigator? No, I'm talking about when 
you refer back to the time that began with Prince

08:44.456 --> 08:51.446
Henry and the time that closes on down through the 
17th century. You speak of that in terms of age of

08:51.767 --> 08:53.850
exploration. Right, right. And I'm saying in the 
decades of the 50s and the early 60s, you choose to

08:54.912 --> 09:00.780
use the same word. That's right. Was that 
deliberate? That's right. And if you ask a guy like

09:04.126 --> 09:10.395
Walter Monk, what kind of a guy I am, let's say I'm 
essentially an adventurer. Much like these guys

09:11.759 --> 09:15.103
that sailed for Prince Henry. He also calls you a 
naturalist. Yeah. At least in some of the things I

09:19.367 --> 09:20.909
read. Which I assume is the same sort of thing in 
this sense. Sort of a common interest about the

09:24.953 --> 09:27.216
world. Well, what he means by that is that

09:28.878 --> 09:40.070
I was interested in and effective at describing 
things. Not very good at at experimentation or

09:42.033 --> 09:45.056
analysis. I didn't have the mathematical 
background or the experimental skill.

09:54.485 --> 10:11.382
But when it comes to knowing something about a lot 
of different things and being able to put it

09:54.485 --> 10:11.382
together and asking piercing

09:54.485 --> 10:11.382
or penetrating questions, that's always been my 
special knack. And I've helped him a lot by, for

10:13.049 --> 10:20.818
example, by asking him questions about why he's 
doing what he's doing. What does it mean?

10:25.043 --> 10:34.634
Do you have any opinion on the relatively large 
crop of graduate students who are now appearing

10:25.043 --> 10:34.634
from the oceanographic institutions of the 
country? You think there are too many coming out?

10:36.597 --> 10:37.117
Too few? Is this what you visioned for Scripps?

10:45.179 --> 10:51.909
Well, I guess I'm worried about what happened to 
the astronomers. You know, there are about 10

10:51.929 --> 10:55.414
astronomers for every job in astronomy.

10:57.977 --> 10:59.159
What are all these guys gonna do?

11:03.545 --> 11:03.906
I don't know. I don't either. Sometimes I'll tell 
you what historians do. Is a specialized school

11:10.956 --> 11:15.102
such as Texas A&M University a good way to produce 
society's professionals? Or should the school be

11:18.120 --> 11:26.067
more generalized in your concept and what you 
visualized it to be?

11:26.087 --> 11:36.717
Well, I think that,

11:26.087 --> 11:36.717
as I said, the basic purpose of a university 
education should be to learn how to learn. And

11:38.178 --> 11:39.779
that's not as simple as it sounds. It means in the 
first place you need to learn the language. I don't

11:45.035 --> 11:46.257
mean French and German. I mean the language of your 
subject. You need to believe that you can find out

11:50.543 --> 11:55.912
something that hasn't been found out before. And 
you need to think it's fun to find out something

11:55.932 --> 12:00.939
that hasn't been found out before. None of those 
say much about Brick. Principle that you could do

12:05.026 --> 12:07.870
all three of those things and study nothing but 
physics.

12:11.816 --> 12:13.759
The reason, but that's...

12:17.502 --> 12:20.066
only part of it. Another aspect of learning how to 
learn is to be interested in things.

12:27.617 --> 12:30.762
And the way you get interested is to know something 
about them. At least that's the way I get

12:32.745 --> 12:34.748
interested. And therefore, I think people need to 
know something about a lot of different things and

12:34.768 --> 12:42.159
be interested. Enough so they're interested. Not 
necessarily enough so they're experts, but

12:43.421 --> 12:46.986
enough so I think it would be nice to know more.

13:01.018 --> 13:03.844
I'd like for the next series of questions

13:13.291 --> 13:18.118
I should like for the next series of questions to 
concern theories of international cooperation.

13:18.959 --> 13:22.564
You've done much in terms of this spirit of 
international cooperation. Would you comment,

13:23.305 --> 13:27.912
please, upon some of these and what you feel about 
them? What about NORPAC? How did it develop your

13:29.714 --> 13:34.561
attitude towards it, and do you think 
international cooperation works? Well, NORPAC

13:36.945 --> 13:42.673
was an idea of Joe Reed, who was a descriptive 
physical oceanographer. And

13:43.514 --> 14:04.706
his idea was that we ought to get a kind of a 
photograph of the North Pacific Ocean, the water

13:43.514 --> 14:04.706
masses of the Pacific Ocean during one season and 
one year.

14:07.370 --> 14:11.496
And in order to do that, we had to get a lot of ships 
out simultaneously.

14:15.340 --> 14:17.643
And so we went to Japan.

14:21.768 --> 14:23.069
I went to Japan, I guess.

14:30.058 --> 14:32.921
I think somebody from the Office of Naval Research 
went with me. I'm not quite sure about that. I don't

14:34.082 --> 14:35.064
quite remember that. And worked with the head of 
the hydrographic office.

14:44.517 --> 15:04.237
in Japan, a nice little old man

14:44.517 --> 15:04.237
whose name slips my mind for the moment,

14:44.517 --> 15:04.237
and also with the fisheries people there. And they 
arranged to have several of their ships take part

15:05.319 --> 15:08.162
in it. And the Canadian Oceanographic Group in 
Nanaimo

15:15.972 --> 15:22.581
under Tully took part also.

15:22.601 --> 15:27.047
And the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries ships in 
Hawaii.

15:29.850 --> 15:41.946
And

15:29.850 --> 15:41.946
we were able to produce them as a kind of an atlas of 
the North Pacific for that one time. That's

15:43.951 --> 15:46.393
something that meteorologists do all the time. 
They have synoptic weather maps. But it's very

15:49.436 --> 15:57.203
difficult in oceanography because

15:49.436 --> 15:57.203
it's so much more difficult to make the 
observation. You can make a map of ocean surface

15:58.024 --> 16:10.555
temperature, more or less, on merchant ships, at 
least along the routes that merchant ships

15:58.024 --> 16:10.555
travel.

16:10.575 --> 16:12.557
But in many areas of the ocean where there aren't 
any merchant And of course, they never stop and

16:14.208 --> 16:21.695
never take observation from the surface.

16:21.715 --> 16:32.106
I guess this was the first

16:21.715 --> 16:32.106
international operation that we were engaged in 
here at Scripps.

16:32.246 --> 16:39.833
There had been quite a bit of the same kind of thing 
in the Atlantic, sponsored by the International

16:32.246 --> 16:39.833
Council for the Exploration of the Sea. And the man 
I told you about yesterday, Bjorn Helen Hansen,

16:46.388 --> 16:56.741
had been involved with several of these 
multi-ship expeditions.

16:56.761 --> 17:15.383
Then I guess the biggest cooperative venture of 
this kind was the International Indian Ocean

16:56.761 --> 17:15.383
Expedition,

16:56.761 --> 17:15.383
which was a project first proposed and out and 
detailed by the Scientific Committee of Oceanic

16:56.761 --> 17:15.383
Research.

17:18.417 --> 17:29.312
which was appointed by the International Council 
of Scientific Unions in 1957, I think it was.

17:29.332 --> 17:43.210
This is called SCOR, and it still exists, S-C-O-R.

17:29.332 --> 17:43.210
And the idea, I think the idea came first from 
Columbus Islam.

17:47.037 --> 17:52.143
meeting at Woods Hole, first meeting, organizing 
meeting for SCORE and I was the president of it. I

17:54.426 --> 18:15.711
was the first president of SCORE and presided at 
this organizing meeting and I sort of picked the, I

17:54.426 --> 18:15.711
did pick the members of SCORE and decided that 
Columbus would represent the International

17:54.426 --> 18:15.711
Geographical Union and George Deacon, the 
International Union of Geology and Geophysics

17:54.426 --> 18:15.711
and so forth. Then the executive board of ICSI had 
been appointed to these people as representing

18:16.552 --> 18:23.861
the different unions.

18:26.724 --> 18:28.447
I guess the unions had to be consulted, too. There 
was a man named Bernicke from Germany who was the

18:28.467 --> 18:37.718
head of the German, civilian head of the German 
Hydrographic Office. It was all civilian in those

18:39.360 --> 18:40.642
days.

18:43.545 --> 18:45.968
In Germany, there was a

18:57.187 --> 18:58.709
several European countries. And of course, 
eventually, we had representatives from

18:58.809 --> 19:13.409
Australia, a man from Australia, George 
Humphreys,

18:58.809 --> 19:13.409
a man from Japan. It was really an international 
committee, but representing not countries, but

19:15.672 --> 19:22.401
unions.

19:26.127 --> 19:42.742
And there was a Russian member, Vladimir Vladimir 
Korg,

19:26.127 --> 19:42.742
who was their great exploring type 
oceanographer, physical oceanographer.

19:45.925 --> 19:50.209
I think Zenkevich was a member, too. Well, it's 
easy to find out who the members were, and I'm not

19:50.229 --> 19:53.772
sure that I I can give you anywhere near a complete 
list of the first.

19:59.907 --> 20:14.263
Anyhow, Columbus proposed at this meeting in 
Woods Hole that one large area which needed a lot

19:59.907 --> 20:14.263
more field work was the Indian Ocean.

20:14.283 --> 20:22.932
It was the unknown ocean in 1957 and the way that the 
Atlantic and the Pacific were not. And we all took

20:25.460 --> 20:29.746
this up with great, great enthusiasm.

20:33.050 --> 20:51.535
And we appointed a coordinator, not an 
oceanographer at all, but a

20:33.050 --> 20:51.535
social scientist who had worked for the Navy for 
several years as a project officer for the

20:53.607 --> 21:05.182
experimental

20:53.607 --> 21:05.182
testing unit of the Navy. It was

21:05.222 --> 21:11.089
a fleet task force that tested equipment. He'd 
been one of their project officers. His name was

21:14.273 --> 21:19.359
Bob Snyder.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.661
He traveled around the world.

21:23.442 --> 21:33.832
drumming up enthusiasm for this big operation 
that we proposed in the Indian Ocean, getting

21:23.442 --> 21:33.832
ships and ship plans. And altogether, they ended 
up with about 20 ships going to the Indian Ocean,

21:35.594 --> 21:42.480
doing different things.

21:46.684 --> 21:49.787
Everybody telling everybody else what they were 
doing and putting together where they could. We

21:51.860 --> 22:04.677
never had the kind of thing that we had at NORPAC, 
where everybody was out there simultaneously so

21:51.860 --> 22:04.677
we could get a picture of a physical oceanography.

22:04.697 --> 22:12.047
Rather, it was a series of

22:04.697 --> 22:12.047
studies of particular phenomena. For example, 
Johnny Knauss went out with his ship from Rhode

22:12.067 --> 22:21.259
Island and got A couple of others, one of our ships 
involved, and two of our ships, I guess. A study of

22:29.224 --> 22:37.312
whether there was an equatorial undercurrent, 
like the Cromwell current sitting in the Indian

22:29.224 --> 22:37.312
Ocean. And the interesting thing about the 
circulation of the Indian Ocean is that it

22:38.573 --> 22:44.459
reverses itself every year. Part of the time, the 
currents go west. Part of the time, the currents go

22:46.961 --> 22:50.925
east because of the monsoon. the wind-driven 
current.

22:55.787 --> 23:03.355
And under those circumstances, Johnny's 
question was whether you would get an equatorial

22:55.787 --> 23:03.355
undercurrent.

23:03.375 --> 23:19.731
Warren Wooster and Henry Stommel and the English 
group concentrated on the Somali current, which

23:03.375 --> 23:19.731
was a very fast, big current on the northeast side 
of Africa. It's like the Gulf Stream,

23:22.445 --> 23:32.217
except even stronger and bigger because it's in 
low latitude. And my car, the Oldsport, is quite

23:32.238 --> 23:34.701
weak.

23:46.616 --> 23:51.422
And Bob Fisher and Bruce Hazen

23:54.237 --> 24:18.800
Quite a few other people concentrated on the 
bottom, on the geology and geophysics,

23:54.237 --> 24:18.800
particularly on the bottom topography and the 
bottom sediments and geophysical measurements

23:54.237 --> 24:18.800
of the thickness of sediments and the depth 
through the moho and things like that.

24:22.103 --> 24:23.704
So we ended up Ten years later, or five, whatever 
the time when the most intense work was being done,

24:24.595 --> 24:38.949
I guess the early 60s was the most intense, the 
concentration of ships there. Australians were

24:40.270 --> 24:45.235
involved and the Russians were very involved. And 
we gradually built up quite a bit of cooperation

24:45.255 --> 24:50.080
with the Russians. Particularly with the 
geophysicist, Udinsev. U-D-I-N-T-S-E-V.

24:55.832 --> 25:14.131
U-D-I-N-T-S-E-V.

24:55.832 --> 25:14.131
We ended up at the end of about five or six years with 
two results. One, that we knew an awful lot more

25:14.271 --> 25:17.094
about the Indian Ocean than we did before. And the 
other is that there were a lot of oceanographers

25:18.015 --> 25:20.337
interested in it. but they've been going there 
ever since. Is the approach to oceanography quite

25:24.918 --> 25:27.702
similar in all these countries? I know this is a 
difficult question to answer, but if you, for

25:28.823 --> 25:44.426
example, had to compare Australian, Russian, and 
American oceanographers, do you use about the

25:28.823 --> 25:44.426
same techniques, about the same tools, ask about 
the same sorts of questions?

25:48.692 --> 25:50.374
Well, the Russians and the Americans, Not the 
Australians.

25:55.716 --> 26:15.552
The Russians and the three major oceanographic 
institutions in this country with all the modern

25:55.716 --> 26:15.552
scripts are big, multi-disciplinary,

25:55.716 --> 26:15.552
multi-purpose, multi-objective,

25:55.716 --> 26:15.552
heavily financed institutions. And they send 
their ships out on these complex expeditions

26:16.375 --> 26:22.961
where they try to do as many things all at once. 
That's also the technique the Russians

26:24.022 --> 26:29.487
have used. And they're concerned basically with 
the world

26:29.507 --> 26:36.153
ocean. Not so much with any particular part of it.

26:41.277 --> 26:46.382
On the other hand, the Australians

26:48.303 --> 27:15.947
have much less effort going into oceanography, 
much less emphasis on the operation,

26:48.303 --> 27:15.947
on the continuing operation of big ships, and

26:48.303 --> 27:15.947
more concerned with

26:48.303 --> 27:15.947
their part of the ocean, the waters around 
Australia, the waters around Australia. very

27:16.957 --> 27:18.279
much more provincial.

27:21.465 --> 27:38.475
The British and the Germans and the Japanese

27:21.465 --> 27:38.475
have operated much

27:21.465 --> 27:38.475
like we have, but they've had a special interest in

27:42.657 --> 27:43.678
some parts of the ocean. For example, the British 
have always had a great interest in the Antarctic,

27:43.758 --> 27:59.798
and the Japanese in areas where they catch fish, or 
where they hope they might catch fish. The Germans

27:59.818 --> 28:10.892
in

27:59.818 --> 28:10.892
two areas, fishing North Sea fisheries and the 
Indian and the tropical Atlantic. These are

28:20.426 --> 28:21.607
scientific.

28:28.335 --> 28:39.968
The French have, well the French have, you can't 
characterize the French very well because there

28:28.335 --> 28:39.968
are several groups. in France, one of them led by 
Jacques Cousteau.

30:09.706 --> 30:10.663
One, two, three, testing. One, two, three, 
testing.
