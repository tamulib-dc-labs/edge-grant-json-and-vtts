WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:10.540
I might have a good friend that I want to promote it, 
but his record is not as good as the others. How in

00:10.860 --> 00:17.788
the hell can you promote him and have him embarrass 
you later because everybody's going to know who in

00:10.860 --> 00:17.788
the hell is on the board. But if I've got a fellow 
that I know and he's got a good record and it's equal

00:18.950 --> 00:28.401
to all the others and I know him, You remember, I'm a 
human being. That's a guy that I'm probably going

00:31.272 --> 00:34.216
to select for promotion. But I don't want to get in 
that sort of process. I support the whole system. I

00:40.182 --> 00:49.312
think it makes mistakes, but again, you're 
dealing with people,

00:40.182 --> 00:49.312
and I support it. Well, let me ask you a question 
about your record. According to your record, you

00:56.748 --> 01:14.567
were promoted to Brigadier General 1 December 
1965, and then underneath that it says Major

00:56.748 --> 01:14.567
General 1 July 65, which is earlier, and then under 
that it says promoted 1 October 69. What is the

01:16.589 --> 01:19.111
situation there? Let me see if I can explain that.

01:24.845 --> 01:27.167
You've got an Army, Navy, and Air Force.

01:30.970 --> 01:34.993
It ought to have a balance in the ranks, promotion 
this year. Admirals this year in the Navy, rear

01:35.034 --> 01:54.750
admirals, two-star rear admirals this year, the 
two-star Air Force, and two-star Army all ought to

01:35.034 --> 01:54.750
rank from this year according to when they're 
promoted. Okay? In other words, you and I were on

01:56.501 --> 02:04.971
this year's list announced in December for 
promotion next fiscal year. Okay?

02:11.198 --> 02:13.621
You were number one on the list, I was number two. 
Navy's got the same thing, number one and number

02:13.701 --> 02:18.426
two, and Air Force number one and number two. 
General comparative ranks should be the same

02:18.710 --> 02:24.197
amongst the three of us, Army, Navy, and Air Force. 
Yes, but this deals with the Navy, doesn't it?

02:26.860 --> 02:29.663
Yeah, this deals with the Navy of one grade. You see 
what I mean? They go from zero to two stars. So to

02:33.068 --> 02:36.251
balance that, that's what you do. You backdate to a 
data rank. You see my data rank? Okay, well that

02:40.717 --> 02:44.081
explains it. Okay, now in this position this 
dual-purpose job which you had for three years,

02:48.443 --> 03:07.225
from August 62 to October 65, in

02:48.443 --> 03:07.225
this job, was it considered like a tour of duty, or 
would you have stayed there longer at the request

02:48.443 --> 03:07.225
of the Secretary of Defense? Well, they try to 
respect.

03:20.472 --> 03:34.487
is considered

03:20.472 --> 03:34.487
for a colonel and staff position a three-year tour 
is considered a

03:20.472 --> 03:34.487
complete tour duty.

03:37.730 --> 03:40.734
I think mine was a little longer than that. But 
that's at the request of the secretary. You've

03:45.548 --> 03:59.128
described McNamara, now that I've heard some 
words about his so-called whiz kids that he

03:45.548 --> 03:59.128
brought into the Department of Defense, one of the 
attempts, of course, to make it more cost

03:45.548 --> 03:59.128
efficient, to streamline it. Did you meet any of 
these people? Who were they? What did you think of

04:02.373 --> 04:05.358
them? I'm trying to think of one of their

04:15.620 --> 04:17.042
I can't think of his name now. Well, let's put it 
this way. I got along with him and worked with him,

04:19.345 --> 04:29.879
but I thought they were an egotistical 
anti-military

04:19.345 --> 04:29.879
bloc, generally speaking. And you didn't think 
that of McNamara? Uh, no. I thought he was just

04:36.268 --> 04:38.050
anti-people.

04:41.995 --> 04:46.819
And I accepted the fact that- You mean he was 
unsociable? No, he just didn't think too much of

04:48.020 --> 04:50.402
people. He thought people are just a bunch of, you 
know, they had no personal feelings or anything.

04:59.470 --> 05:11.260
What I guess that I'm trying to say, he thought you 
could computerize people and just push a button

04:59.470 --> 05:11.260
and they'd all fall out, you know, and line up and so 
on and forth. In no way in God's world you'll ever

05:12.235 --> 05:15.439
manage people. You lead people, but you'll never 
manage them in the same sense as you manage blocks

05:15.479 --> 05:34.501
of wood, or tanks, or airplanes, and so on and 
forth, and manage the finance and the other

05:15.479 --> 05:34.501
aspects of life. You just can't computerize the 
individualities of each guy. and get a handle on

05:41.159 --> 05:45.965
management of all that. That's what he, that was 
his major, that and the political, total

05:46.185 --> 05:57.039
disregard for the political side of democracy. 
But you didn't care for the so-called whiz kids?

06:00.002 --> 06:01.064
Oh, I got along with them. I don't think they made a 
contribution.

06:05.695 --> 06:14.385
I can tell you that they probably contributed to 
the political loss, as you may call it, of the

06:05.695 --> 06:14.385
Vietnam conflict.

06:17.589 --> 06:22.855
I know of nothing that they did that made a 
contribution during that period of time.

06:29.162 --> 06:32.766
They were the ones that was involved in having the 
war end with not one tank, not one airplane, not one

06:34.703 --> 06:39.248
round of ammunition left. Okay. Let's talk about 
some of the interesting episodes during that

06:40.309 --> 06:46.815
Kennedy period. One of course is Cuba. Yeah. Tell 
me about your dealings. Cuba was a sort of thing

06:53.622 --> 07:02.972
that

06:53.622 --> 07:02.972
my boss and I slept in the Pentagon during the 
intense days of that. We were responsible for the

07:06.753 --> 07:31.879
reserve call-up,

07:06.753 --> 07:31.879
which was against my better judgment, but I was 
overruled because of the inadequacies that they,

07:06.753 --> 07:31.879
particularly the Army, were coming up with in 
order to go to fight the war in Cuba. Why were you

07:35.788 --> 07:38.092
against calling up the reserves? I felt like that

07:38.893 --> 07:58.002
we ought to go do it with what we had in hand, and

07:38.893 --> 07:58.002
I felt that

07:38.893 --> 07:58.002
we were over exaggerating what we needed. For 
example, why do you need to call up 300 or 400

08:00.007 --> 08:16.730
reserve colonels to come in and supplement a staff 
that's already 25% overstrength in the

08:00.007 --> 08:16.730
Department of the Army? Tell me why you want to do 
that. Call them mobilization designees? Why do

08:21.317 --> 08:22.519
you want to do that? Why did they? They didn't. I 
denied that. But they wanted it. Why do you want to

08:28.559 --> 08:38.129
call up a truck company

08:28.559 --> 08:38.129
and you have no trucks and it has one truck? What are 
you getting out of that?

08:42.574 --> 08:50.283
Why do you call up the worst truck company you've 
got instead of calling up the best if you really

08:42.574 --> 08:50.283
need one? Because of bad management and you don't 
know what the hell you've got. And it exposed to the

08:54.487 --> 08:57.891
world the inadequacies of our army particularly 
in its management and knowing the readiness and

08:58.867 --> 09:07.316
what it has in the reserves.

09:13.041 --> 09:28.637
It was so bad and so embarrassing to us as a nation 
that I refused completely and did not get

09:13.041 --> 09:28.637
overruled on calling up the reserves for Vietnam 
until after I had left there. somebody come in and

09:28.938 --> 09:30.700
call them up. And, of course, the units that they 
called up never got themselves in shape to go. And

09:40.432 --> 09:41.613
they called up very few. Yeah, very few.

09:45.638 --> 09:53.387
Now,

09:45.638 --> 09:53.387
they called up Signal Company.

09:57.372 --> 09:58.033
They called up amphibious truck companies and all 
this sort of stuff with no trucks and people. And

10:04.846 --> 10:06.429
what did they do? And no equipment to give them.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.778
It's a total disaster. And that's the reason why I 
didn't want this done. I knew the status of our

10:16.923 --> 10:19.527
reserves.

10:23.212 --> 10:25.135
And so why do you want to do that? Well, it was the 
most embarrassing episode of our time

10:27.275 --> 10:40.680
in this decade, I believe, from the standpoint of 
the military. Next to Mr. Carter's Iranian

10:41.582 --> 10:49.637
disaster, where he's gonna go evacuate the

10:53.617 --> 11:23.033
hostages now were you then were you as far as the 
manpower is concerned were you in charge or was one

10:53.617 --> 11:23.033
of your functions to help assemble that very large 
invasion force down in Florida only the reserve

10:53.617 --> 11:23.033
aspect the other part that we are deeply involved 
in is seeking manpower requirements totally and

11:23.198 --> 11:51.417
control of manpower cornerments and what do you 
bring out of the what do you call up and web

11:23.198 --> 11:51.417
individuals do you allow the cuban conflict to 
pull all the school teachers and the lawyers and

11:23.198 --> 11:51.417
the doctors out of one village or out of that one 
part of the country and so on and forth to support

11:23.198 --> 11:51.417
that conflict down there or do you go ahead and try 
to do it without being disruptive to the whole of

11:23.198 --> 11:51.417
our society or where do you declare a national 
emergency and and call up everybody and put a

11:52.156 --> 12:20.239
package of legislation national emergency 
legislation that high and I had a lot of it that

11:52.156 --> 12:20.239
government controls goes on pricing and housing 
transportation air gasoline food services the

11:52.156 --> 12:20.239
whole thousand things would be totally 
disruptive for the whole of our society because

11:52.156 --> 12:20.239
you got a little old conflict down here that you 
ought to clean up in about ten days?

12:27.915 --> 12:38.490
The answer is no, but you've got to justify that by a 
lot of facts and data which you spend a lot of hours

12:27.915 --> 12:38.490
putting together to support your position.

12:43.457 --> 12:49.045
Was your opinion in a Cuban Missile Crisis that it 
would be a During those days, during those very

12:49.717 --> 12:57.646
tense days, you said that you were sleeping at the 
Pentagon. Yes, sleeping in my office, yes. Tell me

13:01.410 --> 13:04.814
about the feelings there, the tension. How were 
the people? How were they behaving? Did they feel

13:10.020 --> 13:12.923
war was winning?

13:17.645 --> 13:20.948
A lot of us knew what hour we were going to go.

13:23.851 --> 13:24.272
What do you mean? Oh, we were within hours of 
blowing the whistle.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.121
Went at 10 o'clock one Sunday morning.

13:38.426 --> 13:44.832
The president got a call over the hotline from 
Khrushchev and said, I'll move them out. And

13:44.932 --> 13:47.635
goddamn, we were worried about the Pentagon. 
phones down

13:48.340 --> 13:57.969
at JCS in the operations room.

13:57.989 --> 13:59.911
My boss buzzed me on the phone. He said, don't you 
think we ought to go home? It's Sunday. I said,

14:02.433 --> 14:03.674
well, I'm ready. Let's go. Who was your boss? Norm 
Paul. Oh, yeah. So, we left,

14:08.859 --> 14:14.044
went home. And then there was a collective sigh of 
relief? I guess everybody gets worked up to these

14:17.618 --> 14:21.826
things. You get ready to go, so what the hell 
difference it make, you know?

14:28.197 --> 14:28.899
You know that? Did you feel that America was 
prepared? Well, we were about to sink Georgia and

14:33.848 --> 14:36.252
Florida.

14:43.927 --> 14:54.640
Yeah, I said, God damn, we move one more truck down 
there, that damn place, those places are gonna

14:43.927 --> 14:54.640
sink.

14:54.660 --> 14:55.781
Unloaded Fort Hood.

15:01.128 --> 15:07.836
Damn, I said, I told Norm Paul one morning, I said, 
he said, we still have Florida underwater? I said,

15:07.956 --> 15:12.702
no sir, not yet, but I said, boy, it's getting 
pretty damn high.

15:16.630 --> 15:18.873
Did you have the plans made out for the invasion? Oh 
hell, yeah. You have contingency plans all the

15:20.656 --> 15:22.618
time. Oh yeah, oh yeah. Hell, we were ready to go.

15:30.850 --> 15:31.872
We were ready to go.

15:39.082 --> 15:41.726
Did you have any dealings whatsoever with the Bay 
of Pigs? No, no.

15:49.621 --> 15:51.823
and other organizations.

15:56.327 --> 16:09.038
What about the early years of Vietnam when we were 
just starting to put in our advisors, getting them

15:56.327 --> 16:09.038
up to about 16,000 by the time of death? I was 
responsible for coming up to President Johnson

16:10.399 --> 16:18.246
with a manpower plan for support conflict in 
Vietnam. Oh, you were? Yeah. Mr. McNamara called

16:22.240 --> 16:29.006
Mr. Paul at 7

16:22.240 --> 16:29.006
o'clock one evening. I think this is about October 
or November of 1963

16:29.087 --> 16:39.397
or 64, somewhere in there.

16:43.141 --> 16:46.404
Probably 64, a year or so after the death of 
Kennedy. Yeah, 64. Bob McNamara called Norm Paul,

16:50.506 --> 16:54.512
and I was in with Norm Paul. It was about 7 o'clock at 
night.

17:00.120 --> 17:18.808
And Bob said to Norm, he said, Hey, Norm, I've got to 
have a plan, an entire plan to support conflict in

17:00.120 --> 17:18.808
Vietnam to the president at 9 o'clock in the 
morning. said, uh, put an analyst on that and give

17:20.628 --> 17:31.588
me a plan for my signature as president by nine in 
the morning. Norm said, uh, well the analyst is

17:32.670 --> 17:37.138
sitting right here with me. And McNamara said, 
okay, go ahead and get that done for me. I'll see it

17:43.709 --> 17:45.252
in the morning. So I'd let my secretary back there, 
Virginia McGuire, and I'd send all my other

17:46.919 --> 18:00.079
officers, all colonels and captains from the Navy 
and the Air Force and Army. You'd send them home?

18:04.966 --> 18:06.308
Oh, they'd all go home. I'd let them all go home. 
Back there, Virginia McGuire, who was a favorite

18:08.852 --> 18:14.580
of Ms. Hollingsworth and one of the secretaries 
that I've had, She was locking up the safes, and I

18:16.619 --> 18:25.049
said, get your book.

18:27.773 --> 18:32.839
She said, what's

18:27.773 --> 18:32.839
all about? I said, well, I said, we just got a 
requirement here we got to put together. She said,

18:38.466 --> 18:45.394
I haven't been home before 9 o'clock in two weeks, 
and I don't even get a chance to wash my clothes. I

18:46.842 --> 18:50.606
said, well, you can take care of that some other 
time. I said, right now, get that safe open and get

18:50.626 --> 18:53.609
your book here. I want to dictate to you the plan 
that's got to meet the president in the morning at 9

18:53.709 --> 18:59.555
o'clock. We finished it at 5 o'clock in the 
morning, about 18 pages. And she said... And you

19:07.643 --> 19:09.665
did it yourself? I did it myself. How could you come 
up with it? In other words, you had to... I've been

19:15.071 --> 19:16.292
working on this stuff. and you just had it on the top 
of your head. Oh, yeah, I'd already thought about

19:21.304 --> 19:24.588
it, you know.

19:26.431 --> 19:37.265
So,

19:26.431 --> 19:37.265
I said, Virginia, how do you like that? She said, I

19:37.386 --> 19:43.714
believe that's the best one you've ever dictated.

19:46.360 --> 19:52.867
And I said, well, you know, there's only one word 
that you've missed all night long. And I said, we

19:55.310 --> 20:02.498
got about 18 or 20 pages. I said, why don't you just 
go ahead and

20:02.599 --> 20:10.948
prepare. I had the last page prepared for my 
initials, J-F-H. And I had to lead Page into, for

20:17.782 --> 20:41.504
Secretary of Defense, through Assistant 
Secretary of Defense, manpower, subject,

20:17.782 --> 20:41.504
manpower support for Vietnam conflict, 
underlined, date, and so

20:17.782 --> 20:41.504
on. I said, I'll tell you what to do. Go in there and 
change to get Mr. McNamara stationary now

20:45.524 --> 21:12.347
and put Memorandum for the President of the United 
States subject and

20:45.524 --> 21:12.347
re-type the last page and put Robert M. McNamara. 
She said, you really feel confident about that?

21:16.945 --> 21:26.013
Then when I get through, give me ten copies

21:16.945 --> 21:26.013
so we can finish this thing off. Had the safes 
locked up. I got in my car and went home. I guess it

21:32.639 --> 21:34.260
was five o'clock. I shaved five o'clock in the 
morning. I shaved.

21:39.685 --> 21:45.670
Woke Miss Hollingsworth up at 6.30 and said,

21:48.130 --> 21:50.972
I'll try to get home earlier today, but I don't know 
what time. I went back. I belong to the Secretary of

21:54.856 --> 21:57.058
Defense at Miss. I get back at 7 o'clock and here's 
my boss, Norman Paul. Here's Dr. Foster, a

22:03.603 --> 22:07.306
director of research and engineering. Here's Mr. 
Cyrus Vance, who is a deputy secretary of defense,

22:08.747 --> 22:17.715
former secretary of the army. now former 
Secretary of State

22:18.083 --> 22:47.145
and here is Mr. Charlie Hitch who is a comptroller 
of the Defense Department

22:18.083 --> 22:47.145
and Mr. Tom Moore who is Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Installations and Logistics

22:18.083 --> 22:47.145
and

22:18.083 --> 22:47.145
seemed like There might have been one more 
assistant secretary there. We were having

22:54.633 --> 23:18.313
breakfast and discussing usual subjects of 
common interest when Mr. Paul said, you know,

22:54.633 --> 23:18.313
Holly, we've got to get out of here and it must be 730 
now and get this paper ready for Bob on that

22:54.633 --> 23:18.313
manpower support plan. I said, oh, I finished that 
at 5 o'clock this morning. He said, you must be

23:26.065 --> 23:27.347
kidding. I said, no. He said, well, where is it? I 
said, it's in this little package I got down here.

23:33.937 --> 23:34.899
He said, let me see it. I said, I got a copy for 
everybody here. He started reading it. Deputy

23:41.309 --> 23:44.634
Secretary of Defense started reading it. I said, 
hell, nothing wrong with this Mr. Charlie Hitch

23:48.213 --> 24:16.279
the comptroller who has to pay for all this said 
well let's take this paper and go see Bob right now

23:48.213 --> 24:16.279
they took my damn paper stamp top secret should be 
signed out you know by everybody back and forth

23:48.213 --> 24:16.279
everybody touching a long list of names whoever 
read it took my paper Top secret. I've never seen

24:20.512 --> 24:21.973
the paper again. They delivered by McNamara to 
President Johnson. He kept the paper. That came

24:29.182 --> 24:45.741
the support plan that Mr. Johnson, the president, 
dictated back to the Defense Department to

24:29.182 --> 24:45.741
support, manpower support for Vietnam, JCS, 
Army, Navy, Air Force. Nobody had chopped on it.

24:49.115 --> 24:52.220
That's fantastic. Yeah, that's the way things 
happen.

24:59.450 --> 25:03.977
So it's basically your plan then for Johnson's 
call up? It was his plan. How he was going to support

25:09.084 --> 25:12.950
the manpower requirements for Vietnam.

25:16.095 --> 25:17.637
That's incredible.

25:20.148 --> 25:48.788
but that's some experiences you get involved in at 
the cabinet level and this is what makes this is

25:20.148 --> 25:48.788
what makes all

25:20.148 --> 25:48.788
the hard work and sacrifice that you may go through 
a time worthwhile you know to make a contribution

25:20.148 --> 25:48.788
you see to have a part in what the hell's happening 
in the management of our whole country and running

25:20.148 --> 25:48.788
of our whole country

25:49.021 --> 25:59.433
That to me is worth spending a lot of hard days of 
study and hard work and everything else for. To get

25:59.854 --> 26:04.620
yourself in a position where you make a 
contribution to do something. Now at this time of

26:06.041 --> 26:14.151
course one of Matt and Amara's desires was to 
so-called streamline the military and to get rid

26:06.041 --> 26:14.151
of some of the overlap that we had in each service. 
For example, some of the supply in the supply area

26:17.837 --> 26:32.576
and the defense intelligence agency trying to set 
up one agency instead of having every service have

26:17.837 --> 26:32.576
their own agency. Well, you know... How was your 
feeling toward the streamline? Well, it's a

26:37.803 --> 26:42.670
matter of why should the Army be buying 30 caliber 
ammunition and the Air Force 30 caliber

26:43.409 --> 27:13.281
ammunition and the Navy 30 caliber ammunition 
those are three procurement agencies and all

26:43.409 --> 27:13.281
three doing different all three different 
accountabilities systems and why don't you

26:43.409 --> 27:13.281
consolidate that and see if you can't get it all 
together cheaper more cost effective and get

27:14.324 --> 27:24.678
better control of what the hell the requirements 
are, and better management. And I agree with that.

27:27.962 --> 27:41.800
I can't see why the Air Force has to have Granadas, 
and the Navy has to have Valiants, and the Army has

27:27.962 --> 27:41.800
to have Chevrolets. And they may all pay a 
different price. They have to stock all different

27:46.868 --> 27:50.653
kinds of spare parts. Why don't you put that all 
together and let a procurement agency provide

27:50.673 --> 28:04.011
them with that capability, maybe get it cheaper 
and cut down on carrying three different kinds of

27:50.673 --> 28:04.011
spare parts. Now this did raise some anger in 
military circles because some of the Well,

28:12.239 --> 28:19.688
because of inter-service rivalry and because of 
some of the people who were moved or shifted

28:12.239 --> 28:19.688
around. Like setting up the Defense Intelligence 
Agency, General Maples was in on that, and he said

28:19.708 --> 28:39.373
there were a number of people that were really 
irritated that each service was losing some of its

28:19.708 --> 28:39.373
intelligence capabilities for one centralized 
organization. Did you... Would you, I mean, did

28:41.737 --> 28:44.540
you hear a lot of grumbling? Oh, I think, well, I 
think every time you change something, whether

28:44.781 --> 29:06.305
it's change for the better or change for the worse, 
there's nothing that, nothing in life amongst

28:44.781 --> 29:06.305
people that hurts worse than change.

29:09.869 --> 29:11.271
That, that really... that's really one of the 
worst things that can happen to people is change

29:11.656 --> 29:40.144
because some like it and some dislike it and when 
you get change in policies you get change in

29:11.656 --> 29:40.144
organizations people are going to they're split 
right down the middle on these things generally

29:11.656 --> 29:40.144
speaking and in the case of the intelligence group 
it's kind of pull together, if you're the

29:40.867 --> 30:04.654
Secretary of Defense,

29:40.867 --> 30:04.654
you get one set of reports out of the Navy, another 
one from the Air Force, and another one from the

29:40.867 --> 30:04.654
Army, and maybe they're all three in this one 
particular instance reporting on the same thing,

29:40.867 --> 30:04.654
and you're getting three different reports. So, 
what do you say? You say, well, who in the hell am I

30:06.236 --> 30:10.080
supposed to believe in this damn thing? Well, why 
don't we have somebody take what all three of them

30:10.752 --> 30:26.521
are reporting and don't let me have to go dig into 
each one of them to reconcile the differences.

30:27.583 --> 30:29.567
Isn't there somebody else that can do that? And I 
think this is what it's all about. And we ended up

30:35.002 --> 30:46.716
with a lot of directorships, Defense Nuclear 
Agency, he became the key guy for all nuclear

30:35.002 --> 30:46.716
aspects of the Department of Defense. Defense 
Supply, DSA, Director of Security Assistance

30:46.816 --> 30:54.986
Agency, he's responsible for all military sales. 
DIA, Director of Intelligence Agency.

31:03.503 --> 31:08.609
National Security Agency was already in 
existence, and it is a national level. CIA is a

31:09.190 --> 31:11.493
national level. NASA, a national level 
organization. But they did put in those director

31:16.759 --> 31:25.270
areas, and I think that they made a hell of a good 
contribution myself. Okay, now you said- Well,

31:25.991 --> 31:33.460
they have not denied, in the case of DIA- the Army, 
Navy, and Air Force from having their own

31:33.625 --> 31:41.640
intelligence capability, which I think is very 
appropriate. I have not denied that. Now, you're

31:46.329 --> 31:48.814
on the cabinet level. Did you attend cabinet 
meetings with Presidents Kennedy and Johnson?

31:54.044 --> 31:55.988
No, Mr. McNamara would only invite someone if 
there was a specific thing that he felt the

31:56.204 --> 32:11.105
presence of the individual would enhance his 
position in bringing about amongst the other

31:56.204 --> 32:11.105
cabinet members what he wanted to get done. Same 
way with him appearing before Congress. He would

32:16.793 --> 32:23.983
take a 250 or 300 page black briefing book and he'd 
go almost totally alone. And he knew everything

32:26.596 --> 32:30.843
that was in that book and on what page it was. He had a 
photostatic memory of that whole thing. And when I

32:36.191 --> 32:54.679
would prepare something, a change that he wanted 
made, or a change would occur on a particular table

32:36.191 --> 32:54.679
or a page pertaining to manpower or reserves, I had 
to take that particular page up there, and he would

32:36.191 --> 32:54.679
look at it, the new one, And he'd look at the old one, 
and he'd photograph the change I'd made, then he'd

32:56.110 --> 33:07.807
personally take out the old page and put the new 
page in his briefing book. So he had photostatted,

33:07.827 --> 33:17.001
and you never had to worry about him coming back and 
saying he didn't tell me what the difference in

33:07.827 --> 33:17.001
this thing was. Phenomenal fella.

33:23.630 --> 33:23.991
Yes.

33:30.670 --> 33:30.910
No. You left that position in 1965 to go, well you 
had a position for just three months there, Office

33:32.332 --> 33:47.209
of the Deputy Chief of Staff or Personnel, and then 
you went to the Office of the Chief of Staff of the

33:32.332 --> 33:47.209
Army. Well, I was on two boards. I was on two boards. 
One promotion board, Oh, I see. And one selection

33:56.022 --> 34:08.040
board for students to go to the Army, War College, 
National War College, to Britain, and Canadian

33:56.022 --> 34:08.040
War Colleges. Those are just temporary? Yeah, 
those are temporary before going to Vietnam.

34:12.826 --> 34:16.051
Okay, so then you went to the 1st Infantry 
Division. Right, I went to the 1st Infantry

34:16.071 --> 34:19.716
Division. Let's start talking about that. Had you 
volunteered for Vietnam? Oh yes, I had

34:24.113 --> 34:44.039
volunteered for Vietnam about every six months

34:24.113 --> 34:44.039
since I prepared that manpower paper and I knew we 
were going to start to build up over there.

34:44.379 --> 34:52.450
Continue

34:44.379 --> 34:52.450
now with Vietnam. You said before lunch that you 
had tried to get over there. You'd volunteered

34:57.719 --> 34:59.801
about every six months. Yes. And you finally made 
it. What was your feeling about going back to war?

35:06.026 --> 35:22.420
Well, I thought that we had an important 
responsibility over there, and I had no doubt

35:06.026 --> 35:22.420
about the fact that what I had seen in Washington 
there before the real buildup came that we were

35:23.193 --> 35:53.065
going to do another piece of surgery on that 
country as we had done in Korea

35:23.193 --> 35:53.065
and stop the influx

35:23.193 --> 35:53.065
of communists from the north and also

35:23.193 --> 35:53.065
restore some sort of government other than 
communism down in the South, as was the case in

35:53.382 --> 36:00.954
Korea. That was a masterful act on the part of the 
United States to stop communism and separate the

36:02.476 --> 36:20.605
communists from the non-communists in North and 
South Korea, and I had hoped that that would be the

36:21.513 --> 36:23.995
The same thing would be true in the case of Vietnam. 
What were your responsibilities on this first

36:25.457 --> 36:27.719
tour? My responsibility on the first tour was 
deputy commander for all military action and

36:27.739 --> 36:38.950
maneuver on the part of the 1st Infantry Division. 
I was assistant division commander for maneuver,

36:39.611 --> 36:50.862
and maneuver means in the simplest terms for 
conducting the battles. within the first

36:51.567 --> 36:52.869
division. There's two assistant division 
commanders or two deputies to the major general,

36:53.710 --> 37:08.652
one for maneuver and the other one for supply, 
maintenance, logistics, support. So, my

37:10.675 --> 37:17.305
responsibilities for maneuver was to keep the 
troops ready to fight,

37:18.466 --> 37:37.813
keep them trained, conduct the battles, get 
involved in the planning for the battle, and then

37:18.466 --> 37:37.813
the execution of the plans when we were in battle. 
And to oversee fire support, tactical air

37:39.656 --> 37:44.322
support, coordination between the artillery and 
the tactical air, and the coordination, the

37:44.791 --> 37:56.005
movement, the airlifting of the battalions back 
and forth in the assault areas. So it was a very busy

37:56.145 --> 38:00.050
time. In addition to that, you are also involved in 
seeing how well people are trained and how well

38:00.791 --> 38:10.984
they're doing. and try to correct the mistakes and 
errors that are being made oftentimes.

38:19.316 --> 38:25.364
Some on the part of soldiers and officers who are 
not as trained as well as they ought to be. So that's

38:26.626 --> 38:31.092
primarily what my responsibility was at that 
time. And I was there about 15 months. And where was

38:33.475 --> 38:35.438
the first division? First division was in war 
zone. three which encompassed Tainan Province.

38:43.381 --> 38:56.853
It encompassed about eight or nine provinces 
north and west of Saigon near the Cambodian

38:43.381 --> 38:56.853
border.

39:00.716 --> 39:06.521
And also touched on the Laos border, Laotian 
border. Who was your general? The division

39:09.352 --> 39:15.780
commander then was William E. Depew, D-E-P-U-A. 
One hell of a great, fine fella. Yeah, who later,

39:19.784 --> 39:25.411
who later, and we made quite a team, the two of us. We 
worked very closely together and had a fine

39:27.634 --> 39:37.806
relationship. And as a matter of fact,

39:39.170 --> 39:53.533
during the 15 months that I was in the division, we 
had one AWOL, one soldier went AWOL, that's all.

39:53.553 --> 39:54.134
Only one? Only one in 15 months. In the whole 
division? In the whole division. In the whole

39:59.042 --> 39:59.943
division. That's the kind of respect that we had 
from the soldier.

40:08.617 --> 40:10.719
a remarkable sort of record. But we stayed busy and 
when it came time to rest we left the soldier alone.

40:20.629 --> 40:26.536
Let's talk about some of the operations that you 
had during these 15 months. Well we had several,

40:26.556 --> 40:28.398
many.

40:32.782 --> 40:38.488
We had I think one operation in which We fought 
every regiment of the 9th VC Division, which was a

40:40.207 --> 40:48.676
key elite division. But Operation Junction City, 
and that was

40:48.696 --> 41:08.256
in War Zone C, I guess it was, instead of 3, War Zone 
C. Tainan Province, Fook-Long Province,

41:09.603 --> 41:18.053
north of Saigon in the Tainan, Quang Tri, Loc 
Nguyen, An Loc area. And I think one of the most

41:20.276 --> 41:39.238
significant battles that points out how great 
America is is

41:20.276 --> 41:39.238
on the night

41:20.276 --> 41:39.238
of March 1967,

41:40.636 --> 42:02.678
Troop A of the 5th U.S. Cavalry, which the 5th U.S. 
Cavalry belonged to the 9th Infantry Division,

41:40.636 --> 42:02.678
and the 9th Infantry Division were new in country.

42:05.594 --> 42:28.277
And they were involved in opening and closing the 
road between a place called Lai Kei, which was the

42:05.594 --> 42:28.277
first division's base headquarters, and Quang 
Tri, which is up north,

42:05.594 --> 42:28.277
and a big rubber plantation. opening the road and 
keeping it open so that supplies could get through

42:29.742 --> 42:38.710
to operating troops that had air assaulted into 
the areas.

42:41.773 --> 42:58.028
And about midnight that night, a troop

42:41.773 --> 42:58.028
of the cavalry was in a wagon train formation, 125 
little guys. And they were hit at midnight with a

43:00.421 --> 43:26.108
heavy concentration of mortar fire

43:00.421 --> 43:26.108
and then assaulted from midnight until five 
o'clock in the morning by the 273 VC regiment.

43:28.990 --> 43:32.893
And this is on Highway 13 just north of Ly-K.

43:39.319 --> 43:46.806
This 273 Regiment had a strength of about 1,900 
people and they attacked 125. The

43:46.966 --> 43:58.356
message got to me about five minutes later in my 
headquarters at Ly-K, which wasn't very far from

43:46.966 --> 43:58.356
there, This troop was being attacked.

44:07.415 --> 44:14.384
As a matter of fact, they were assigned to the 1st 
Division at that time because all of the 9th

44:07.415 --> 44:14.384
Division hadn't gotten in.

44:19.250 --> 44:22.234
And I immediately got airborne.

44:26.686 --> 44:41.221
As a matter of fact, I was commanding the division 
at the time because General Depew had gone away on

44:26.686 --> 44:41.221
some other assignment on leave for two or three 
weeks and I was the senior and I was commanding the

44:26.686 --> 44:41.221
division.

44:46.787 --> 44:55.596
I immediately got in my helicopter and went there 
and started communicating with the 5th

44:55.897 --> 45:08.634
Lieutenant Colonel who was not in the fire base 
with the troop, but was some distance away in his

44:55.897 --> 45:08.634
headquarters. And then I started communicating 
with a little cavalry troop commander. It is very

45:14.762 --> 45:20.149
important that you maintain communication with 
them.
