WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:04.111
check this in just a minute and see if we are. Okay, 
if you'll begin by telling me your name and where

00:04.151 --> 00:08.856
you were born. Well, I was born in Musquis, 
Coahuila, Mexico. And my name was given to me was

00:16.063 --> 00:21.748
Guadalupe Garza. Then my mother and my daddy come 
to the United States in In August the 26th, 1926, we

00:31.030 --> 00:37.336
passed through Eagle Pass. And since then, we've 
been given in the United States. Yeah, I mean in

00:41.440 --> 00:44.162
Texas since then. And then we grew up over here in 
the, what you call, the brass bottom. And we went to

00:50.248 --> 00:52.810
school over there. We were 12 in the family, six 
boys and six girls. And my daddy was... farmer or

01:00.882 --> 01:30.163
agriculture, we used to plant cotton, corn in the 
fields, and we used to help them during the, not

01:00.882 --> 01:30.163
during the school period, but during the harvest, 
we used to help them and pull the cotton, pick the

01:00.882 --> 01:30.163
cotton, and then my, every year, you know, at the 
end of the year, my daddy will equalize the whole

01:00.882 --> 01:30.163
crop and then give them money, But I think those 
days were happy days to us. And all of my brothers

01:36.008 --> 01:40.092
and sisters, we all went to school. We got all that 
good education. I mean, not high school, but some

01:43.236 --> 01:50.283
got towards ninth grade, 10th grade, in those 
days. And I think that was good. And so all my family

01:53.887 --> 01:59.593
moved to the state of Oklahoma. And they all live 
over there except me. I live here. But then I got

02:03.549 --> 02:06.252
married in 1942. I got married to Mr. Medina. And 
then we... What is his first name? Julio. Julio

02:13.740 --> 02:14.762
Medina. Julio C. Contreras Medina. And he works at 
the MSC as a cook. He's doing a little vacation in

02:23.031 --> 02:25.734
Mexico. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's there. They called 
this morning from... from close to Monterrey. My

02:32.778 --> 02:35.561
daughter and my son-in-law, they went over there. 
So then my daddy, before he come to the United

02:36.042 --> 02:50.436
States, he was born in Muscas, also in the same 
state and the same city we were born. What did his

02:51.317 --> 02:53.679
father do in Muscas? That would be your 
grandfather.

02:58.805 --> 03:04.472
I really don't remember, but I believe in those 
early days. Before the Revolution. Before the

03:05.694 --> 03:06.515
Revolution. I guess all of it was like a farmer, you 
know. They have their little crops and all that.

03:12.883 --> 03:14.625
Did they have their own land? Well, they never did 
mention no land, but I think they were not well off.

03:22.919 --> 03:27.266
But they were, you know, just making a living 
somewhere over there in Mooskies. And so, I

03:27.286 --> 03:30.952
remember my grandfather. I remember him and my 
grandma. I remember both. And I remember when

03:34.918 --> 03:50.023
grandpa, in 1934, no, it's 1932, my 
father-in-law, my grandfather, his name was

03:34.918 --> 03:50.023
Martiniano Garza, he passed away. And I remember 
to this day, I was about six years old, but I

03:50.628 --> 04:06.104
remember that they make a casket, you know, with 
some new boars, and they put some linen, and all

03:50.628 --> 04:06.104
this means put in a wagon. And we took him, and he was 
buried over here at Snoop. No, Tunis. That's where

04:12.330 --> 04:14.973
he's buried. Then in 1934, Grandma passed away, 
and we did the same thing. And I still remember the

04:18.995 --> 04:24.900
roll and the wagon and everything. You know, the 
funerals those days, we didn't even touch no

04:25.221 --> 04:30.125
ambulance, no nothing. We just made our own 
funeral. But I remember seeing the father,

04:36.531 --> 04:41.095
because they were Catholic. I remember the father 
went and gave her the blessing. I remember that

04:44.638 --> 04:47.280
real good, because they took the father from here 
to Bryant, to the farm, and he gave all the church

04:47.615 --> 05:05.048
rights, and then she passed away that day, and then 
the father said, well, and nobody complained, and

04:47.615 --> 05:05.048
nobody said nothing, no ambulance, no nothing, 
but it was this wagon. I remember we were little. We

05:08.314 --> 05:09.977
all climbed on the wagon. And they had about four or 
five wagons, of course. All the people from the

05:12.878 --> 05:20.248
same, these men that called themselves Porres, 
they owned all those lands over there. So we took

05:20.268 --> 05:24.333
one more over there into the graveyard. But I still 
remember that this minister took part in the

05:24.353 --> 05:33.905
service of the graveyard. And he read the rights. 
But then I was seven years old. I remember then. I

05:40.315 --> 05:45.682
remember then when he got some dirt and say, ashes 
to ashes and all that. And I know that man to date,

05:46.102 --> 05:59.640
but I never had the knowledge or the thinking to 
tell him that I know him, that he went and performed

05:46.102 --> 05:59.640
a run ball field. But I don't know what happened. 
Every time I wanted to tell him something, it had to

06:01.202 --> 06:04.146
happen. But I really wanted to tell him that he was 
the one that went over there. But I don't know who I

06:10.073 --> 06:11.435
am. I kind of put it off every time I get a 
conversation. I want to tell him, but I don't know.

06:18.764 --> 06:24.632
I have to go and tell him that he was the first man 
that I... that I heard say something about God or

06:25.051 --> 06:30.757
something, like that other Bible or something. 
Because we, all the background, we didn't have no,

06:30.777 --> 06:35.721
we never did go to church. Nobody teach us nothing. 
Nobody say nothing. We were just living in the

06:38.624 --> 06:42.588
farm, you know, way far from the other people. We 
didn't know nobody. Yeah, but your family was

06:43.769 --> 06:46.232
Catholic at that time. Yeah, my family was 
Catholic, so the priest went over there. But in

06:49.595 --> 06:54.940
Mexico, my father was a, well, he was a, I think his 
rank was a cap in the military service. But you see

07:00.159 --> 07:03.483
that their Revolution War was bad. Well, let's 
begin kind of at the beginning. What year was your

07:07.208 --> 07:08.610
father born? Well, I don't remember that. How old 
is he now? He's 89. He's 89 now. I think he was born

07:17.102 --> 07:22.750
about 1870.

07:24.063 --> 07:26.907
He was born in the early 1880s. So when the 
Revolution came, he was probably in his late 20s or

07:27.708 --> 07:35.919
early 30s. Yeah, he was. Well, when my daddy 
entered the service, he said he was just 12 years

07:37.080 --> 07:43.388
old. Was he in the Army before the Revolution? No, 
but he had some military background. He had some

07:49.722 --> 07:52.204
military background before it happened. By 12, he 
was already a military man. And was he then in the

07:54.847 --> 08:00.714
Dias troops, the federal troops? Something like 
that, but he got to know Pancho Villa, that's for

08:00.794 --> 08:04.638
sure. And I wish he was here, I'd ask him, and he'd 
tell me, yes, I know Pancho Villa, you know, in

08:05.198 --> 08:11.325
person. He always tried to describe us, the men, 
but we just He didn't believe and didn't think this

08:16.662 --> 08:19.566
was too serious. And we told him that what kind of a 
man was he. And he said, oh, he was a, what you call

08:23.631 --> 08:27.396
it, go-getter. He was a mean man. He said, yeah, 
that's one thing they have to say, that he was a mean

08:30.080 --> 08:33.805
man. Because if things don't go his way, he'd kill 
anybody. No matter if it was a kid or a little girl or

08:38.471 --> 08:43.257
a boy or a woman or anybody. A man, it didn't make him 
no bigger. And your father was a soldier with

08:46.582 --> 08:48.926
Villa? No, my father was a soldier, but this is 
Pablo González. Pablo González. Pablo González.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.663
Yeah, Pablo González. And now I've been reading a 
little history, and I see those names, but I don't

08:58.043 --> 09:03.473
know who the person was. But he was Pablo González 
and another by the name of Huerta. Victoriano

09:07.523 --> 09:13.394
Huerta, and your father was with Huerta and 
Gonzales. Every time he said Pablo Gonzales, he

09:14.155 --> 09:26.899
was his captain or something, but my daddy had a 
good military background in military service. He

09:27.166 --> 09:29.634
was actually fighting against Villa. Well, yes, 
he was fighting against Villa because he died

09:29.694 --> 09:38.020
thinking that he was doing right. But he said, no, 
he was not doing right, because he killed more

09:38.168 --> 09:47.984
people, innocent people, than people that really 
need to be killed. Because my daddy said that,

09:48.004 --> 09:54.194
well, we always ask, well, why are y'all the same 
nation, the same people? Why did y'all have these

09:54.254 --> 09:56.838
fights against each other? He said, well, because 
we were fighting against the government, against

09:56.858 --> 10:05.492
the government, because the government didn't 
treat the nation right, because They didn't look

10:05.962 --> 10:09.246
for the poor or they didn't help the poor. And then I 
asked the question, how much money did you earn?

10:13.452 --> 10:14.933
About a month or a week. Nobody had no payroll. They 
had to go up to the cities and rob the banks and the

10:16.596 --> 10:22.263
stores and give things what they needed. Of 
course, they had the power because they had guns

10:22.603 --> 10:27.469
where they wouldn't grab anything to eat. They'd 
go through fields and ranches and all that thing.

10:31.134 --> 10:33.437
They'd kill cows and make still barbecue there and 
then eat it and then take off to another time but he

10:33.940 --> 11:01.483
said the main thing we did and we know that we did he 
said fight it against the government because he

10:33.940 --> 11:01.483
they they was not treating the people right he said 
if the family was living over here and having two or

10:33.940 --> 11:01.483
three girls if a man abused one of the girls there 
was no law instead of helping well they they come

10:33.940 --> 11:01.483
and take your son you just because you told that i 
did wrong your son will go to the what you call it

11:02.003 --> 11:22.662
what you call to the government federal what you 
call the federal government they they shaved his

11:02.003 --> 11:22.662
head uh hair off and put her what you call a cap and 
that was the as my father said that was the the

11:02.003 --> 11:22.662
hardest task the nation took because if you got a 
son and he didn't commit no crimes Why did he have to

11:23.131 --> 11:26.015
go serve to the government? Because somebody else 
did a crime. You see, and that way the nation, the

11:28.658 --> 11:33.464
poor people was, you know, intimidated. That way 
they can, if there is something wrong to your

11:33.544 --> 11:39.632
family, you can't say to the public. If somebody 
did something to your family, just keep it to

11:39.652 --> 11:44.959
yourself, or else they're going to get one of your 
boys. And my daddy said, well, that was that. This

11:47.768 --> 11:53.397
was the thing that the nation, the people, the 
federal government did wrong. They did wrong. But

11:56.421 --> 11:58.024
the revolution, Villa fought. He was fighting. He 
said he was fighting against that. Yeah, he

12:01.229 --> 12:04.394
thought, you know, he died thinking. And, you 
know, I saw that way late, way, my daddy had a book.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.067
And I don't know, he still got that book. And I can 
see the man. And I can recall the bed where he was

12:16.979 --> 12:19.722
laying. But I don't know if he got the book yet. But I 
see the wounds, you know. It was in black and white.

12:26.469 --> 12:27.751
I can see the wounds. And it was a big, heavy-set 
man. Heavy-set like Joe Stalin. With big

12:32.876 --> 12:34.378
mustache. Yeah, that was the year when he was 
killed. Yeah, he was wounded. And they had him in

12:39.764 --> 12:41.946
some kind of bed. But I remember that book. I don't 
know if he got it. I'm going to. I'm planning to make

12:45.937 --> 12:50.804
a trip this summer, and I'm going to get involved 
into all those details. See if I can get the book and

12:50.824 --> 12:54.229
get some pictures out of it. How many years did your 
father fight all together? Oh, he fought about, I

12:59.317 --> 13:08.711
think about, he said the war started the 12th, the 
8th or 9th, 8th or 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th,

12:59.317 --> 13:08.711
14th. I think he said about six or seven years. 
before everything come to the conclusion, you

13:11.789 --> 13:20.061
know, because he said that the federal government 
had everything under control. They had arms, they

13:20.101 --> 13:24.888
had rifles, they had a lot of everything. But he 
said that he think that Spain had a lot to do with

13:25.208 --> 13:30.476
that. Spain, because once Mexico was under 
Spain's rule, you know, the rule, and then he said

13:30.516 --> 13:38.387
all the the most of the money and most of the gold, 
the Spanish people, the Spaniards from Spain took

13:38.603 --> 13:47.232
it. And they believed that the more people that got 
involved in this was the priests, because all the

13:47.252 --> 14:06.333
pilgrims, all the people from the church took the 
gold and took everything to the church, and then

13:47.252 --> 14:06.333
the priests, when they fled out of the country, 
they took all that money. So my father said that

14:08.827 --> 14:13.853
that he believes those people did wrong, too, to 
the nation. And they said that's why Mexico

14:13.873 --> 14:22.565
learned a lesson, but it was kind of hard because 
they have to kill each other thinking. Like my

14:23.245 --> 14:32.858
father-in-law was telling me the other day, he 
said, you know, in one time, a son was fighting

14:23.245 --> 14:32.858
against his father until they would meet each 
other with a rifle. He said, well, you're my

14:32.878 --> 14:35.521
father. And they didn't shoot each other, but he 
said there was almost one against each other. And

14:41.049 --> 14:54.856
he said the main thing they was fighting for equal 
rights, equal rights, because he said that they

14:41.049 --> 14:54.856
want everything equal, not because somebody 
committed a crime, somebody else have to pay. If I

14:55.738 --> 15:00.687
got hurt, well I have supposed to, I mean, if I got 
hurt, the people that hurt me, have to pay for what

15:00.903 --> 15:02.325
he did. Not my son, that he didn't do anything. But 
you see, they had this thing so good with the

15:05.651 --> 15:16.448
government that my boy have to pay for the crime 
that other men commit. He said it was a married man.

15:18.371 --> 15:20.074
Well, he had a family. He had something to get along 
by. But not my son. Well, you ain't got no. Just

15:25.342 --> 15:28.547
because you told authorities this, your son will 
pay for that. And this, when all the poor people got

15:29.118 --> 15:35.609
against us, they said, no, the innocents always 
have to pay. We can't do that. What did your mother

15:38.253 --> 15:41.418
do the whole time your father was fighting? Well, 
you see, all the ladies stayed at home. In Muscas?

15:47.909 --> 15:49.551
Uh-huh, Muscas. Was there ever any fighting in 
Muscas? No, my mother used to tell us that the...

15:55.882 --> 16:03.397
Well, I went to Monterey, yeah, to Monterey, and 
that's the, the mosque is not too far from

15:55.882 --> 16:03.397
Monterey. Well, she used to talk about some 
mountains. She said he hear the, you know, when

16:05.922 --> 16:11.713
they shoot the canyon, she used to hear the, you 
know, the booms. And now that I saw that, I said,

16:12.217 --> 16:22.311
well, the fighting was near that, but I never did 
get close to that mountain where they were

16:12.217 --> 16:22.311
fighting, but it's still there. And my mother used 
to say, I never did went to no war. I never see, well,

16:25.415 --> 16:30.142
she never did see nobody fighting with the guns. 
Now that's what she told me. But she said that one

16:32.004 --> 16:34.107
day that, that you can see the dust from the horses 
that were coming toward the town. And so they

16:39.834 --> 16:46.682
yelled that, you know, they had somebody to be 
looking, like a guard, you know, looking and

16:39.834 --> 16:46.682
yelled that they were coming. So they flew, flew, 
flee to the mountain. And my mother said, and I took

16:50.145 --> 17:02.760
my shoes and she said she lost her shoes on the way to 
the mountain because she said that they had a sheet

16:50.145 --> 17:02.760
and they, all the good things they put in the sheet 
and they, uh, wrap it up and took it they found a hole

17:02.926 --> 17:25.272
and put it there so that i think they went all the way 
over there and they got it because they they didn't

17:02.926 --> 17:25.272
stop they keep uh you know walking through the 
other side of the mountain get as far as they could

17:02.926 --> 17:25.272
get so my mother said you know she said they must 
have had her fighting before there because he said

17:02.926 --> 17:25.272
there was a man standing over there with a big fire, 
you know, a big fire. And my mother said she could

17:27.812 --> 17:34.260
see some fingers on that pile of wood they had over 
there. She said she was a little girl. She said she

17:36.703 --> 17:42.550
had her shoes like these, you know, and his arm and 
shoulder. And she was walking to a little trail

17:42.890 --> 17:45.994
over there. You know, a smoke and a big old, she 
thought it was wood, but it was not wood, it was the

17:46.244 --> 17:50.651
people. It was people. They were burning the 
people, yeah. Who was burning them? This man,

17:54.937 --> 18:03.790
this, you know, people from the, what I said, from 
the farm, you know, from the little village that

17:54.937 --> 18:03.790
live over there. Because you say, you know, all 
that, all that odors will bring a... Oh, they were

18:09.903 --> 18:13.830
people who were already killed. Yeah, they were 
burning the bodies. They were burning the bodies.

18:17.236 --> 18:19.920
And then I asked my mother, why did they dig a grave? 
My mother said, it would take a lifetime to dig a

18:20.321 --> 18:26.311
grave because there were rocky mountains over 
there. There was nothing but rocks. And they

18:28.054 --> 18:30.659
didn't have enough men to dig a big hole. You know, 
just like a pole. She described a pole, you know,

18:33.483 --> 18:35.607
like a like when you put some cut on the floor, you 
know, about a bale of cut. He said, that's how much

18:40.325 --> 18:42.728
the power was. Now, my mother said, and they put a 
lot of branches and a lot of wood, and she think they

18:43.148 --> 18:53.481
put gasoline or kerosene, a lot of kerosene in it, 
so they can burn the whole thing. But she said, when

18:53.821 --> 19:00.189
I passed through there, she said, I can see some 
fingers, you know, the fingers of the men, and the

18:53.821 --> 19:00.189
hands. And this man had a fork made out of wood, He 
said he was wrecking all that meat to that pile, so

19:05.185 --> 19:13.377
everything get burned. And she said, I remember, I 
was a little girl then when that war, but I don't

19:13.497 --> 19:23.513
remember what year, because she never told us what 
year, but she used to tell us about that ugly war.

19:23.533 --> 19:24.955
She said, and you know what? She said, when I saw 
that, I asked my aunt, because she was a premature

19:24.975 --> 19:31.885
baby. She never had no... no sisters and no 
brothers from her side, because she was born, what

19:34.042 --> 19:46.882
you call a premature baby, and her grandma raised 
her here on her chest. That's a little bit of her,

19:46.902 --> 19:58.581
and so his daddy got married with another woman, 
and she said, and then they give it to this, her

19:46.902 --> 19:58.581
godmother and godfather, she said, they raised 
me. But every time those federal people come, we

19:59.101 --> 20:09.552
have to run, make a run to the mountains, because if 
they ever catch us, they kill us. Did they run when

20:10.112 --> 20:12.255
the revolutionaries came, too? No, no. Just when 
the federals came? Yeah, when the federal

20:15.658 --> 20:17.280
government came. And my mother said that this is 
the same revolution, I think, but this is what they

20:17.380 --> 20:27.370
were looking for, this man by the name of Manuel. 
Manuel Garduña. They claimed that he was a big, you

20:29.802 --> 20:34.282
know, bandit or robber or something like that. 
Well, my mother said that she was my older sister,

20:37.897 --> 20:45.086
they was, you know, making some tortillas like 
they used to do in their little thing, what you call

20:37.897 --> 20:45.086
it? Metate. Metate. And she was, and she said by the 
time this Garduña was there, his uncle and his

20:46.828 --> 20:57.080
cousin was there in that house where my mother 
lived. In Musques. Yes, close to the mountain in

20:58.702 --> 21:00.485
Musques.

21:03.208 --> 21:07.313
And he said they saw the people coming, but they 
knew that there was not a They were not the federal

21:07.698 --> 21:10.381
government. They were what they called the 
civilians, but they were still civilian

21:10.561 --> 21:14.546
warriors. They approached the little house. My 
mother told Manuel, you better go, because

21:18.031 --> 21:21.975
they're coming after you. And he said, no. No, he 
didn't make a way, because he said, I'm not guilty

21:25.099 --> 21:28.523
of it. They just claimed those things, but I'm not. 
I'm not guilty of it. He said, but the old man, his

21:32.608 --> 21:34.971
uncle, It was no wiser than him because he said, all 
the soldiers surround the house and they were just

21:35.288 --> 21:42.678
cleaning their rifles and everything. He said, 
listen, we're going to stay here a little while.

21:45.822 --> 21:47.945
Y'all better get busy and make a lot of tortillas. 
And we got some meat over here y'all can cook. And he

21:50.589 --> 21:55.876
said, my sister and another lady and my mother 
started cooking for those men. And they went and

21:56.217 --> 21:59.762
bring some wood, some more wood, because they had 
no stoves. Now, mother, they had no stoves until

22:00.443 --> 22:04.468
she moved over here to Texas. They didn't know what 
a stove looked like. They cook outside an open door

22:06.977 --> 22:10.060
and some bricks or some rocks. A hearth on the 
ground? Uh-huh, on some rocks. And so mother said,

22:13.283 --> 22:17.167
they told the men to get away from there. He said, 
no, I'll stay here. And then their uncle, who was a

22:19.009 --> 22:23.493
soldier, was standing here in the door like that 
with his rifle. And that man said, excuse me, I'm

22:23.893 --> 22:29.439
going to bring the wood for the lady. And so he 
jumped the soldier and took a little trail to the

22:29.459 --> 22:33.983
wood. He never did come back. But his mother said, 
there was another little tree. She said, and us

22:41.754 --> 22:50.187
thought that this man was cruel with this other man 
because those days they didn't have no mercy. They

22:50.287 --> 22:55.515
didn't give you a chance or they didn't give you a 
trial. They just what you call lynch the man or just

22:55.782 --> 23:05.338
everybody just jump on you and if you were guilty or 
not, you have to pay for whether somebody else say.

23:05.779 --> 23:15.916
So mother said that this man got a rope and put it 
over the branch of the tree and got this man neck and

23:05.779 --> 23:15.916
pulled it. My mother said that man took his tongue 
about that much. about a foot out of his mouth. He

23:22.860 --> 23:30.588
said, you don't realize how big your tongue is 
until you spill it out. You know, mother used to

23:30.908 --> 23:34.492
tell us a lot of stories, and we'd get scared. I 
said, mother, why didn't you all call the law? He

23:37.475 --> 23:38.155
said, what law? There was no law, kids. There was no 
law. We didn't have no law and no order. There's a

23:45.242 --> 23:49.887
reason we come to the United States to look for a 
better chance to live, because You couldn't tell

23:50.221 --> 23:52.224
nobody over there the law. Well, the law was more 
dirty than the other. There was no law. And so he

23:57.591 --> 23:58.592
said that man. And then one of the soldiers, one of 
the assistant soldiers told the captain, don't do

23:59.032 --> 24:04.960
that. Give him a chance. Maybe he'll talk down the 
way they claimed they took him for a trial. But he

24:14.092 --> 24:17.216
didn't get over there, because they kill him for 
the reward. They sure believe in the reward.

24:19.499 --> 24:29.108
Mother said that on those days anybody do 
something, they didn't think about the life of the

24:19.499 --> 24:29.108
man, they didn't think about their personality, 
nothing. What they think is about the reward they

24:29.848 --> 24:35.934
was going to receive, no matter how they get it, but 
they get it. When did your mother and father get

24:36.134 --> 24:38.616
married? Well, they never told us nothing about 
that. We were too young, I guess, or something. We

24:47.824 --> 24:48.865
just... They never did ask, no. We were kind of... 
We never did ask, but my mother, when she passed

24:52.861 --> 24:59.251
away, she was 63 or 65 years. 63 or so, and she died in 
what year? In 1960. In 1960. So she was quite a bit

25:06.562 --> 25:10.147
younger than your father, probably. Yes, she was 
younger than my dad. She was younger, but you see,

25:12.451 --> 25:21.585
those couples in those days, they didn't have 
any... any protection like they got on these days

25:21.565 --> 25:46.915
and the family was just a what you call it they just 
come handy one baby after another that's why

25:21.565 --> 25:46.915
mother had so many babies she had seven girls and 
six girls and six boys and out of those six boys and

25:21.565 --> 25:46.915
six girls that's one boy is dead and one we still 
live in ten boys and i mean five boys and five Well,

25:47.367 --> 25:52.371
that's really remarkable for those days that all 
the children, or nearly all of them, lived. And

25:52.391 --> 25:54.433
they were healthy children. I never did remember 
that one went to the hospital or had tonsils or

25:54.533 --> 26:03.020
stomach aches. We were just raised on the farm, you 
know, like a... Who was the oldest child in your

26:03.040 --> 26:11.988
family? Well, my oldest sister, but she passed 
away. That's the one I remember her. Her name was

26:17.050 --> 26:18.817
Alec. She passed in 1935. Do you know when she was 
born? No, I don't remember. I remember one of the

26:28.593 --> 26:36.802
girls was born in 1922, and another 1923, 24, and 
25. That's me. You were born in 25. And my other

26:39.425 --> 26:41.667
little brother was born in 26. Yeah, the one that's 
a minister, he was born in 26. Yeah, every year, you

26:45.691 --> 26:58.245
see, I was born in

26:45.691 --> 26:58.245
December the 4th, 1926, while my brother was born 
in December the 2nd, 1925. 26, I was 25, and he was

26:58.681 --> 27:03.409
born in 26, just two days. And every time we get a 
birthday, we are in the same week. You see, I'm the

27:08.458 --> 27:12.245
fourth, he's the second, and I'm in the fourth. 
Almost, you know, the same. Almost the same day.

27:15.631 --> 27:16.292
The same day. Well, now, how did your father happen 
to leave Mexico? Well, he, he, he, uh, He just

27:24.736 --> 27:26.878
worked his way over here. He said because he had to 
pay $18 for each passport. And there was my mother,

27:32.703 --> 27:48.438
and my daddy, and my sister, they called him Alec, 
and Raymond, and Luis, and Eileen, and Martin, and

27:32.703 --> 27:48.438
Manuel. There was eight kids that come from 
Mexico. Now, the other ones were born over here.

27:54.267 --> 27:55.188
they were gone. And then my older sister, that's 
the one that was, that passed away, and then there

27:56.110 --> 28:03.680
was Manuel. And out of those, out of the bring from 
Mexico, we still ate. Well, you said something

28:10.149 --> 28:16.238
before about some people that wanted him to be 
abandoned with them before he came. That was my

28:16.258 --> 28:18.021
father-in-law. Your father-in-law? Oh, I 
thought that was your father. No, my father, well,

28:21.105 --> 28:22.587
my father, My father did say something about that, 
too, because he said that people, after the

28:22.837 --> 28:36.249
revolution, after they got through fighting and 
everything come to normal, they didn't want to

28:22.837 --> 28:36.249
work. Steel didn't want to work. They wanted to 
steal and rob the other poor people. And they were

28:40.853 --> 28:44.076
close to the soldiers, because they know how to 
shoot. And my daddy, sometimes, he said, well,

28:44.957 --> 28:52.624
that's one of the reasons I come to the United 
States, because I was tired of the life they were

28:44.957 --> 28:52.624
living, just sleeping on the rocks and shooting at 
each other just like an animal. Let's put it that

28:58.142 --> 28:59.223
way. We didn't even know when we were going to eat. 
Sometimes we don't eat all day. We don't drink no

29:07.451 --> 29:08.592
water. We have nothing. We just have to stay there. 
Then my father said, I thought about it. If I got out

29:15.819 --> 29:19.422
of the service, I'll come to the United States And 
he was living in Piedras Negras, and then he moved

29:19.604 --> 29:26.531
to Eagle Pass. When did he leave Mosques and come to 
Piedras Negras? I think in 1925

29:29.573 --> 29:35.859
that I was born. Right, the year you were born, he 
moved to the border. To the border, close to the

29:38.242 --> 29:47.130
border, because he said he was a... My daddy thinks 
a lot of, what you call it, shepherds. He believes a

29:47.650 --> 29:51.615
lot on those things because he was a milkman.

29:53.558 --> 29:58.384
Before he entered the service and after he got out 
of the service, he was a milkman. He had some little

29:58.404 --> 30:05.193
goats and he delivered some milk. And he still 
thinks that when he goes back, he will do that same

30:05.893 --> 30:10.680
thing. He was a kind of shepherd. He always lived in 
the woods or whatever you call it. He believes a lot

30:15.967 --> 30:20.534
in those things. And then he said he sell wood. And 
then he started thinking he ought to give his

30:25.001 --> 30:29.227
family a chance. He didn't want them to live like he 
did. And you know those Rocky Mountains and they

30:33.314 --> 30:37.660
were no school or nothing. But still my daddy had a 
good school. My grandma believes a lot in school

30:41.532 --> 30:45.197
and they sent him to school. They sent him to school 
in Moskos before the revolution. They had a good

30:48.963 --> 30:50.164
school. And I had an uncle, I remember him as 
Gregori. He had a good school. He was a good, well I

30:55.552 --> 31:01.921
say good sport because he knew boxing and all that. 
You know, they teach the boys all that and he was a

31:02.462 --> 31:06.628
good, and then I remember my uncle coming to visit 
us or to stay with us in 1932. And he asked my daddy,

31:14.526 --> 31:20.192
well, what are you going to do with all this bunch of 
kids you've got and they know how to read and write?

31:20.312 --> 31:21.473
My daddy said, well, I have to work. I ain't got no 
time to deal with the kids. He said, well, you give

31:24.036 --> 31:25.517
them to me. He went and got those pencils. I think 
you remember they were kind of a, well, I don't

31:29.942 --> 31:33.966
know. They would make a little piece of wood, and 
they had a little leg. He bought a lot of them and

31:40.118 --> 31:44.145
started teaching us. I knew how to read and write in 
Spanish when I was seven years old. And this was

31:50.216 --> 31:53.321
your uncle who was living with you right then? And 
he taught you how to read and write in Spanish? To

31:55.845 --> 31:57.388
all the family. We didn't go to school, you know, to 
public school until I was 10 years old, 1935. I was

32:03.855 --> 32:06.558
10 years old. How many years did you go then? I went 
about five years. But you'd had schooling in

32:10.141 --> 32:12.464
Spanish before that. Yeah. Do you think that 
helped you learn English? Well, in a way, yes. In a

32:17.108 --> 32:26.818
way, I say yes, but you see, it was a little harder 
for me because I had a little mixed up there because

32:17.108 --> 32:26.818
I thought the same thing in Spanish was in English. 
until I had to forget my Spanish and start in my

32:27.085 --> 32:30.289
English. And it was, I tell the kids, I don't 
suggest for nobody to know Spanish and then start

32:30.309 --> 32:40.803
in English, because it's kind of a little hard 
until you have to forget your Spanish and then

32:30.309 --> 32:40.803
start in English. It's the same thing backwards. 
If you know English first, it's hard to learn

32:42.325 --> 32:49.214
Spanish. But, oh, I don't think I asked you, what 
town did you live in or near in the Brazos Valley?

32:55.722 --> 32:56.503
Well, Brian. It was right outside of Brian. Yeah. 
Well, what you call the brass bottom, they call

33:00.028 --> 33:04.714
here Mumford. The steel store, that's where I went 
to school. Steel store and Mumford. Mumford.

33:08.899 --> 33:09.280
Mumford. Both schools I attended. How did you 
happen to come, or how did your father happen to

33:10.962 --> 33:17.130
come here to Brian instead of staying on the 
border? Let me see.

33:20.895 --> 33:23.839
They said that we had an uncle before that. before 
my dad, that he was already living here close to

33:24.022 --> 33:29.030
Hearn in a farm. They call it Valley Johnson or 
Goodland. They call it that farm. It's a big

33:36.141 --> 33:38.004
plantation center. They call it Goodland. Well, 
he happened to live there. So he said, I'm going to

33:42.111 --> 33:45.276
send for my brother. They got a lot of kids to come 
over here, and he can live here like a king. And I

33:50.504 --> 33:51.025
think The way it looks, I think my uncle sent him 
some money because he had to pay $18. For each one?

33:57.488 --> 33:59.831
Each one, you know, to make the passport. And we all 
got passports, and they cost $18 each one. And some

34:04.798 --> 34:10.025
money to pay that station wagon that bought us. 
Now, the station wagon in those days was what you

34:10.386 --> 34:14.271
call it? It was just first class, like you come in a 
greyhound. And my daddy said that. That man bought

34:20.873 --> 34:22.976
also over there. And I guess my uncle paid him and 
everything. So we settled right there in that

34:27.823 --> 34:31.027
place. And I can remember the cotton. It must be, I 
don't know what, it was on August. And I guess it was

34:40.721 --> 34:45.808
close to, you know, the cotton was about that big or 
something like that. Because I can remember, you

34:45.828 --> 34:49.733
know, we still remember the farms and and a tree 
that was there and everything. Your father was

34:53.227 --> 34:58.474
actually working on the land that was owned by 
somebody else. And then we moved to there. We moved

35:00.556 --> 35:03.300
to this other place they called Scott. It's close 
to this other side of the heart. And then we moved to

35:08.726 --> 35:13.392
Mumford with this. This man that owns these 
things, the seals, the seals own this place. And

35:18.536 --> 35:23.721
then we owned with this man that he called himself 
Bullet. But before that, those men, I know them.

35:27.805 --> 35:32.129
But further down, I don't remember who was our 
bosses or nothing. But I remember this one's over

35:32.169 --> 35:33.730
here. And then we lived with the Escamados over 
here in the bottom. The same Escamado, he was our

35:37.554 --> 35:39.315
boss. And then we moved to another place they call 
This, let's see, I don't remember the name.

35:50.502 --> 35:52.965
Anyway, Ward, his name was Ward. He owns a huge land 
from this river to the other river. But what

35:58.972 --> 36:03.398
happened, he was not married man. He didn't have no 
family. So we lived there. And that's where we went

36:07.083 --> 36:09.205
to school, to steel store. We were staying in that 
place with that man. He had a lot of farm, a lot of

36:11.729 --> 36:13.551
farm. Well, when did your father and the rest of 
your family move to Oklahoma? They moved in 1943.

36:18.846 --> 36:20.608
In 1943. Why did they move to Oklahoma? Well, you 
see, the beginning of the deal was this.

36:30.901 --> 36:32.744
We were living in Wheelock. Well, you see, the 
crops over there was not so good. So somebody that

36:36.549 --> 36:42.677
went over there by the name of Martinez called, My 
daddy said, if you want to bring a bunch of people to

36:42.927 --> 36:51.081
pull some cotton, pick some cotton, we got a good 
place over here. So we took a trip and we thought it

36:51.361 --> 36:54.327
was good. And it was good and we thought it was the 
Holy Land because everything over there was

36:54.387 --> 37:01.619
going, you know, good. The cotton, they paid good 
money and everything. And still they pay good

37:04.882 --> 37:08.587
money over there in the state of Oklahoma. That's 
the reason my daddy's black over there. And so the

37:10.791 --> 37:17.080
boys did too, you know, because they don't work in 
the cities, you know, they work on the farms. They

37:17.140 --> 37:17.881
like to... They still work on the farms. On the 
farms. And they thought the, you know, the job was

37:20.545 --> 37:29.839
easier and better than here in Texas. So they 
still, they were there. That's their reason

37:32.202 --> 37:34.686
because they said they think they... crops was 
better over there because they got an irrigation.

37:40.749 --> 37:43.973
They make them good. Well did you all travel around 
much when you were kids and pick crops or did you

37:43.993 --> 37:50.380
just mostly stay in the Razzus Valley and pick? No, 
we traveled a lot. We went to the state of Arkansas

37:52.002 --> 37:57.028
and we went to Tennessee. Memphis, Tennessee. We 
went over there to Arkansas and the state of

37:58.810 --> 38:05.559
Louisiana and the state of Oklahoma and the state 
of Texas. Yeah, we traveled. What was that like?

38:07.542 --> 38:10.125
Did you enjoy it or did you dread it? How did you feel 
about it? Well, I'll put it this way. I didn't like

38:13.730 --> 38:25.125
it, but you see, as a family kid, I have to tango 
along with them, but I didn't like it because I

38:13.730 --> 38:25.125
thought it was not good to be sleeping on the truck 
all the time and sleeping on it just like a tramp.

38:25.493 --> 38:27.776
But I'll give you a thought about that. I said, 
well, maybe when I get married, I'll settle down

38:27.836 --> 38:30.861
and don't do this. But find out that I got married, 
my husband started traveling. I said, well, you

38:34.566 --> 38:37.570
better go yourself because I'm not going. But it 
was a lot of fun, all right? You know, when you

38:40.995 --> 38:43.419
forget about everything. It was a lot of fun when 
you go with a lot of girls and boys in the truck and

38:43.439 --> 38:51.951
just yell and jump off the truck and pull all day, 
pull cotton. We thought it was fun. we got to be, you

38:53.708 --> 38:56.573
know, well, we thought it was good. But then, now 
that I, I don't think I ever want to repeat it again.

39:01.862 --> 39:08.372
So there were things about it that were really very 
good and fun and good memories and things that you

39:01.862 --> 39:08.372
just wouldn't have to live through again. No, I 
tell my husband, I say, if you want to go, you know,

39:08.432 --> 39:16.065
places where you better go yourself. This trip 
they took to Mexico. I say, I like to go there, I say,

39:18.189 --> 39:20.172
but not Not that much, I said, because I got what you 
call arthritis. And, you know, it's sitting on

39:25.291 --> 39:29.637
your legs, on your feet, on your body. I said, for 
arthritis, it's not good. You have to move,

39:31.640 --> 39:33.903
exercise. He said, well, I stay with the kids. You 
better go and enjoy yourself. Well, you have been

39:38.268 --> 39:39.991
to Mexico, though. Yeah, I like it over there. I do. 
But I didn't have no vacation. They have. Where do

39:44.975 --> 39:46.537
you work? I work at the cashmere hatchery. 
Cashmere hatchery at the hatchery. Oh, with the

39:52.444 --> 39:54.406
baby chickens. Yeah, what do you do? Well, the 
first step we do is to set the eggs for the, what you

39:55.428 --> 40:02.616
call it, for the hatch. And then wait for the babies 
to hatch. And then, you know, we got what you call a

40:07.582 --> 40:12.849
setting every Monday and every Thursday. Every 
Monday and every Thursday. and we have to pick them

40:14.287 --> 40:20.436
out of the trays, count them, and then take to this 
other place. Some sectors, they take the little

40:20.917 --> 40:32.975
rooster and the little pullet, and then all the 
pullets are in different boxes, and all the

40:20.917 --> 40:32.975
roosters are in different boxes, and we have to 
keep up with all those things. Can you really

40:33.456 --> 40:35.519
separate them when they're that young? Yes, 
because we got one... one kind of chickens that you

40:41.303 --> 40:47.211
can tell which is which just by the wings. Oh, 
that's an improvement over when I was growing up

40:47.691 --> 40:53.859
and we just had to get the little chickens and wait 
until they got big enough. Yeah, well, but this

40:54.059 --> 41:02.190
kind of flock that our bosses are raising is 
different from the others. You see, if you just get

41:02.590 --> 41:10.821
the little wing and open the little wing and it's 
made like a little fan. as a little puller. And if

41:12.560 --> 41:22.250
you get another one and don't have any things like a 
little fin or little white feathers, that's a

41:12.560 --> 41:22.250
rooster. Well, now that's something I didn't know 
about yet. That's fascinating. That's

41:25.534 --> 41:26.395
interesting. It sure is. It's interesting. And I 
wish more people would learn that, because they

41:27.676 --> 41:34.704
pay you good money if you don't have to separate it. 
And we got some sections, they call us, some

41:35.144 --> 41:40.470
doctors from college. They can do that, but not all 
the people. But they put it to us where we can do it.

41:48.233 --> 42:03.314
Now it's got so easy that even us, we can get a box and 
just pick a little chicken and just open the little

41:48.233 --> 42:03.314
feather, I mean the little wing, and you can tell. 
Well, now how many children do you have? I was a

42:07.179 --> 42:08.601
mother of nine. Nine? Nine, but I raised five. I 
lost four little boys. When they were babies? Yes,

42:17.681 --> 42:21.005
they were babies. My first baby was a little boy, 
and he died before he was born. Then I had a little

42:27.555 --> 42:31.360
girl, and she didn't die. And then I had another 
little boy, and he died. He was born at 2 o'clock,

42:34.164 --> 42:38.250
and he died at 9 o'clock. And then I had another set 
of twins, twin little boys, and they died because

42:38.753 --> 42:47.503
they were born as a premature baby. So they were too 
little, I said too little. And then I had another

42:51.047 --> 42:53.990
little girl, she didn't die. And then I had another 
one that didn't die, another one that didn't die,

42:54.010 --> 43:00.998
and the little boy. and another little girl, and I 
have five. They have one son that lives? Yeah, just

43:05.372 --> 43:06.473
one. How old are your children now? Well, my oldest 
girl, she's 27, and the other one is 22, and the

43:08.115 --> 43:19.966
other one, she'll be 21, and my boy will be 17, and my 
little girl will be 15. I've got a 14-year-old.

43:24.931 --> 43:27.854
Well, what are your children doing now? Well, my 
girls, my... My oldest girl, she's working at the

43:31.707 --> 43:37.614
couch cafeteria at the bus station. She works 
there. And my other girl, she lives in the state of

43:39.236 --> 43:41.980
Oklahoma. She works in a factory. I guess it's made 
by the government. I guess she's sewing or

43:46.185 --> 43:47.627
something. Are either one of them married? Yeah, 
both are married. Oh, they're both married. And

43:51.472 --> 43:53.935
the other one is working at the Coca-Cola. And my 
boy, he's in high school. And my little girl is in

43:56.178 --> 43:58.761
junior high. Did your children graduate from high 
school? Yes, two of them. The other one got to the

44:03.734 --> 44:06.198
11th grade. And this is the one that is home. He's 
handsome. This is the one that was talking to you a

44:11.245 --> 44:14.249
while ago. And then my boy, he's in the 10th grade. 
Yeah, he said he's going to finish. He's just two

44:19.556 --> 44:22.040
more years. I got hopes that the other two will 
graduate out of the five. They saw the two graduate

44:28.492 --> 44:35.364
where I had four graduates and just one of the girls 
there when she was 17. But she passed to the 11th

44:36.266 --> 44:41.235
grade, but she didn't make it. Well, it sounds like 
from what you're saying, going all the way back to

44:41.255 --> 44:49.189
your grandmother, that education was important 
in your family. Oh, yes. Do you know when they came

44:51.560 --> 44:55.827
into the Muscus, I can't say it, area? Do you know 
when your family originally came to Northern

44:55.867 --> 44:59.473
Mexico? No, from over there? From further south? 
No, I really don't know, but my mother was born in

45:05.103 --> 45:09.851
Monclova. In Monclova. She told me that she was 
married in Monclova, and I think that the That was

45:16.248 --> 45:17.769
your mother or your grandmother? No, my mother. 
Your mother was born in Mancova. But my

45:20.512 --> 45:26.757
grandmother, my daddy, they were originally from 
Musquis. The way they looked, the way they talked,

45:27.118 --> 45:31.882
they lived there all the time. Maybe in their 
little ranch or village or something, but the main

45:32.202 --> 45:40.970
town was Musquis because all the papers are there 
from Musquis. They don't call it Coahuila. They

45:42.591 --> 45:44.533
call it Coahuila. I was just wondering, Coahuila 
was settled in the 1600s. It was a long time ago.

45:56.174 --> 46:01.603
When my son-in-law told me that he was going to take 
me to my hometown. Have you been back to your

46:01.643 --> 46:02.925
hometown? No, I haven't. Because, I don't know, 
when we went to Mexico, we went to Laredo. But he

46:09.438 --> 46:14.857
said, this time, all the time we go, we're going to 
go through Iklupes, Piedras Negras, and then

46:09.438 --> 46:14.857
Musques. He said, it's a beautiful town. I said, 
well, maybe I'm planning to. I'm looking forward

46:19.314 --> 46:20.578
to it.
