WEBVTT

00:01.145 --> 00:24.115
real

00:01.145 --> 00:24.115
good friends very she took me home to her family and 
uh her name is maria cough We

00:26.238 --> 00:45.830
did correspond quite a bit. Maybe that's the one 
they considered. She later on became a school

00:46.611 --> 00:47.353
teacher. Maybe she wrote to me, but she became a 
school teacher. Not that she... While I was in

00:48.815 --> 00:49.216
camp. So... That's a good question. I can't even 
think to ask who you corresponded with when you did

00:49.837 --> 00:51.199
it. So here's

00:52.377 --> 01:14.585
a romance with a girl, and you just got through it, 
and you went to a tree. You were recuperating, and

01:14.605 --> 01:16.488
you met two girls, or just one? We met both of them. 
We were walking together, both sisters. Did any of

01:17.729 --> 01:21.574
these develop into passionate love affairs, or is 
it just, I'm trying to figure out how, rural this

01:22.145 --> 01:24.331
is. Is this holding hands and walking through the 
park, or is this closeting yourself? I don't mean

01:32.552 --> 01:38.668
to be too straightforward, but I'm trying to 
figure out the level of your worldliness. Oh, I

01:39.053 --> 01:46.860
would say that I was quite smitten by her beauty and 
attractiveness, I would say.

01:51.764 --> 01:55.508
She was a very pretty girl and a fun girl. There's 
the usual attraction, I mean a good healthy

01:55.528 --> 02:04.436
attraction between a young man and a young woman. 
It's just that, good, you know, fun. I'm sure it

02:09.040 --> 02:13.726
could have gotten somewhere.

02:17.531 --> 02:19.894
But it didn't. But it was definitely there. Oh, 
sure. Well, there was another one in Berlin

02:23.418 --> 02:35.233
that I was kind of also very attracted

02:23.418 --> 02:35.233
to. But while I was in camp, and I also got letters 
from her in camp, so it wasn't, that's why I always

02:35.213 --> 02:55.260
said, you know, this one girl thing that was 
mentioned in these articles didn't quite gel,

02:35.213 --> 02:55.260
because if you're engaged, you don't write to two 
or three others. I mean, I never felt engaged in

02:55.360 --> 02:58.945
that sense. But I...

03:04.357 --> 03:26.365
The

03:04.357 --> 03:26.365
other

03:04.357 --> 03:26.365
one that I was also attracted to, like a young man 
being attracted to a number of young, attractive

03:27.290 --> 03:34.661
ladies. And if you're trying to reach the level, I 
would have to fess up. That was quite worldly. Oh,

03:41.852 --> 03:43.875
good. Good. All right. I don't mean it as a value 
judgment or anything like that. I'm not trying to

03:48.963 --> 03:54.472
hedge either and make something out of something. 
I'm trying to get to the truth myself, because what

03:54.492 --> 03:58.878
do I know? I just do it.

04:04.147 --> 04:06.190
Pardon me. When, how do I put this in a more delicate 
way, when did you find somebody

04:14.928 --> 04:23.278
Budapest

04:14.928 --> 04:23.278
had the first what, Spanbridge? U-Bahn. Oh yes, 
the subway. Subway, before Vienna. Yes, oh yes.

04:28.684 --> 04:33.150
Hungary had a... U-Bahn. Hungary

04:33.170 --> 04:39.597
had a beautiful Victorian mosaic on the walls. 
Really? Yeah, just lovely. And it's the biggest

04:43.379 --> 04:46.283
span bridge in the world up to that moment. It was 
built across the Danube, and it was built by

04:46.524 --> 04:51.011
Whistler's father. Everybody hears about 
Whistler's mother. Nobody ever hears about

04:53.194 --> 04:54.756
Whistler's father. He was a famous architect. The 
same family? Same family. Whistler's father was a

04:58.762 --> 05:03.109
bridge builder. He built the huge span bridge 
across the Danube in Hungary. And I think he also

05:09.029 --> 05:13.335
contributed to the Golden Gate Bridge once. 
Really? Yes. I mentioned that in the early days,

05:17.720 --> 05:28.455
that was right after Poland and Hungary, I guess, 
as we talked yesterday, these were all

05:17.720 --> 05:28.455
blitzkriegs. In other words, they went in, they 
didn't last more than a week and a half, really, two

05:28.655 --> 05:35.744
months, I don't know. But certainly not a 
drawn-out, Search and destroy kind of operation.

05:40.372 --> 05:41.454
Yeah, it's like Vietnam. Yeah, where everything 
is in shambles, you know. Okay, anyway. Let me ask

05:46.562 --> 05:59.241
you about, all right, so you have some girlfriends 
and love affairs, and they eventually, letters

05:46.562 --> 05:59.241
followed you even to the POW camp. The other one 
that I... She married your best friend. She

06:02.826 --> 06:03.387
married...

06:08.142 --> 06:09.604
She married a doctor. I've got letters saying that 
she now had two children or something like that.

06:15.273 --> 06:17.876
She married a doctor. Gene is laughing to herself 
at how adolescent men are. Then, let's see, while

06:22.443 --> 06:29.674
we're at it, I'm just trying to open up a hedge on 
that romance department. I was just curious when

06:29.694 --> 06:35.803
you found a man... I'm going to ask this question. 
Why don't we get to it? Marry the Oberlieutenant.

06:41.187 --> 06:41.367
What? Marry the Oberlieutenant. I'm just trying 
to find out how worldly you were when you first met a

06:43.050 --> 06:51.022
girl and went to bed with this girl.

06:51.322 --> 06:51.843
This was hard. When did you go to bed with somebody? 
And the reason I ask is because, one, I'm trying to

06:54.087 --> 06:57.352
assess the worldliness. The isolation up until 
you were with Jean, too. The question of how much

07:02.239 --> 07:04.643
contact were you having? How much of a survivor 
were you? How much of a loner were you? If, for

07:09.852 --> 07:25.333
instance, nothing had happened until after you 
got out of the prison camp, or something like that,

07:09.852 --> 07:25.333
or even into your 30s or 40s, that means that you 
were putting a lot more energy on being alone and

07:09.852 --> 07:25.333
safe. No, I think I was quite interested in the 
opposite sex. 90% of the time. Oh, sure, sure. I've

07:37.509 --> 07:43.858
asked him a lot of those questions, too, and I get 
just as little response as yours. And he thinks I'm

07:44.239 --> 07:47.164
doing that out of just curiosity. I'm not. 
Curiosity, yes. But I was much more interested to

07:50.108 --> 07:55.977
find out what his level of intimacy, how was he able 
to, was he able... in his earlier days to open up to

07:56.227 --> 08:02.556
somebody and have a degree of intimacy then. And it 
was important to me to find that out. Was it just me?

08:06.261 --> 08:15.433
He was unable to get down to

08:06.261 --> 08:15.433
this certain level of how time is almost important 
in a relationship. And I have not, to this point,

08:15.653 --> 08:22.943
been able to get much of a description about how he 
was with other people. Well, Chris, in your case,

08:22.923 --> 08:28.230
there's two answers to this. In your answer... No, 
this doesn't have to be in it at all. This doesn't

08:35.621 --> 08:41.489
have to be... No, no, it's more to understand how 
much of a loner you had been up to that time.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.277
I took... I really learned a lot, or thought I 
learned a lot from the Turk as far as women is

08:47.510 --> 08:53.358
concerned. One of the things that Lowell and I, we 
were absolutely fascinated by the Turk. Lowell?

09:01.008 --> 09:01.910
Lowell Welch, yeah. Lowell Welch. Lowell Welch, 
yeah. Got it. Absolutely fascinated by this Turk,

09:04.533 --> 09:11.102
which is another story sometime if you need an 
interesting character to liven up a few pages.

09:11.322 --> 09:13.365
Sure.

09:15.455 --> 09:25.468
I got into trouble with him once because I 
mentioned one of his other girlfriends in the same

09:15.455 --> 09:25.468
room with the one that he was with. The only time he 
ever got mad at me was, you do not ever mention other

09:25.808 --> 09:33.438
girls in front of your girl. It's an absolute 
no-no. No matter how many times they ask you, they

09:34.739 --> 09:39.505
want to know all about it, you do not tell. Which 
your father told you too, saying that gentlemen

09:39.706 --> 09:44.652
don't discuss those things. This kind of clinical 
approach, you know, is from the old school, is

09:44.851 --> 09:58.324
rejected by the old school of the old macho school, 
the old bull and jumping over the fence school, you

09:44.851 --> 09:58.324
see. So I came from the old... Oh, I understand 
that. And it's not that it needs even any

10:01.327 --> 10:06.552
explanation. There's no judgment to it, of 
course. I was just curious whether... It first

10:10.973 --> 10:16.421
became intimate later in life or earlier in life. 
Yeah, I understand. I knew this was always going to

10:17.863 --> 10:20.247
be a difficult area. Oh, I don't mean to make it 
difficult. Just later in life would be...

10:22.170 --> 10:27.838
No, no. Okay, then it would be that girl that 
married the doctor. Because I had met her when I

10:32.665 --> 10:39.816
visited my cousins in Berlin. And we were out at the 
Tegernsee, I think. She knew some friends, and we

10:44.281 --> 10:50.286
went out for an afternoon of sailing. And this gal 
was there with somebody. And it turned out she

10:54.970 --> 10:58.974
lived fairly close. She lived in Breslau rather 
than in Berlin. She was also a musician there. So we

11:04.698 --> 11:10.123
dated after that, and

11:04.698 --> 11:10.123
we did In fact, I spent a weekend at the ski lodge up 
there together.

11:21.160 --> 11:27.148
So that was about the hottest romance I had, 
besides the one from afar. So I was quite active in

11:28.550 --> 11:33.597
my imagination. reality, I've heard. And this was 
between the

11:38.930 --> 11:45.415
Jesus and he bent over good again. That's the way I

11:46.256 --> 11:51.200
believe it. Well, I was curious, you know, if you 
did have passionate relationships while you were

11:51.220 --> 12:04.191
still in Germany, then you took off, was it on dry 
spell until Jim, or did you manage to have

11:51.220 --> 12:04.191
encounters with him in between? Oh,

12:05.048 --> 12:15.925
yes, yes. We're not talking about intent and 
motivation. Alright,

12:22.235 --> 12:31.630
so you were on furlough, you were recovering.

12:34.073 --> 12:42.921
On furlough and recovery, how did you get from 
there to the training, the Army training,

12:34.073 --> 12:42.921
official Army training? Your wound, your shin 
healed. Yeah, yeah. And then eventually you got to

12:48.806 --> 12:50.708
go into the Army itself. Yeah.

12:55.192 --> 13:01.498
Then I was transferred to the West, to Monheim. 
There was another training, and that's where I was

13:02.575 --> 13:06.681
a drill instructor. It must have been a major 
training center. It's near a railroad, a huge

13:09.625 --> 13:16.073
railroad area, where they probably came through 
and picked them up. We had constantly new units to

13:16.093 --> 13:22.001
train that had gone to different fronts. Oh, I 
probably, but within the next couple of weeks, I'm

13:23.023 --> 13:28.691
going to have graduate students. You're going to 
get them better than you think. Graduate students

13:29.972 --> 13:31.975
who are going to be out looking for them. training 
camps in Germany in 1941, what they looked like,

13:32.242 --> 13:40.169
how big they were, what trains they served them. 
You're probably going to get a lot of these records

13:40.730 --> 13:46.695
at times, more typed down than I can. Lots of pages 
on that soul book that I have a little difficulty

13:47.576 --> 13:55.604
deciphering, because I don't see any mention of 
Heidelberg. It must be another, it may be just an

13:56.605 --> 14:01.489
assignment I was assigned to this school, I don't 
know. Yeah, I noticed there's no photograph in

14:01.469 --> 14:03.371
there either. They used to have a photograph in 
there. Maybe it was pulled out. That may well have

14:09.576 --> 14:15.982
been the photograph that was used for your 
father's photograph. I thought there was one

14:16.242 --> 14:18.864
taken out of the kin carton. There was that other 
little thing I showed you. Besides the soul book,

14:22.247 --> 14:26.031
we had a kin carton, an identification. That had a 
picture, and that was taken out, I think.

14:33.008 --> 14:42.361
So you went, you were a regular army, you were in 
Mannheim at the training camp, you were a drill

14:33.008 --> 14:42.361
instructor, were you also a ski instructor, or 
that was it, earlier? That must have been earlier,

14:42.761 --> 14:51.514
because I was still in the eastern part, I was 
assigned to teaching skiing. That was when you

14:51.534 --> 14:52.515
were in the labor? No, I was, when I was in the basic 
training, either in this, might have been with,

14:53.176 --> 15:01.227
when I was still with the horses, It seems to me I was 
in two places in East Germany before I was shipped

15:01.983 --> 15:10.493
to West Germany. And one of them in East Germany,

15:10.513 --> 15:23.108
because there was no snow, so it had to be, and I 
trained cross-country for Russian front. Right.

15:25.110 --> 15:28.294
Then to Mannheim, then the drill instructor. And 
then you were recycled again and again as a drill

15:29.236 --> 15:33.403
instructor as each unit went through. Were you 
feared as a drill instructor? Did you take it very

15:41.456 --> 15:47.025
seriously, or was it more just a job or a game? Well, 
I like to think that I was a good one. I mean, a

15:51.961 --> 15:53.645
successful one. I could teach people what it is to 
do things easier and better. I try to act as tough

16:01.315 --> 16:14.294
and act like I was supposed to act as a drill 
instructor, but also have a lot of humanities in

16:01.315 --> 16:14.294
it, in my unit, and was always finished first or 
second. We had competition amongst drill

16:14.595 --> 16:21.164
instructors, so I was fairly successful. If we 
were to talk to a member of that unit today, and he

16:21.184 --> 16:30.478
was to look back and say, I was at Mannheim, I was 
under Sergeant Gertner, Boy, what would he say?

16:32.261 --> 16:32.842
What would he say? This guy didn't give us a break. 
He ran us ragged. It would be fun to find out. I would

16:40.369 --> 16:41.650
like to know myself. I'd like to think that I was 
just simply have a good voice. I think

16:47.096 --> 16:50.879
sometimes... How would he describe you? I don't 
know how he would describe me, but I'd like... If I

16:56.785 --> 16:57.546
had to... analyze my approach that I have always 
used, whether it was a drill instructor or a ski

16:58.015 --> 17:23.618
instructor or whatever, to motivate other people 
to do things that I want them to do, was always to

16:58.015 --> 17:23.618
find that certain compromise between toughness 
and fairness. And maybe just a little curl around

17:24.188 --> 17:29.536
the lips for a little joke on them, too. I see. If you 
were, could you imagine yourself? Get the hell out

17:33.001 --> 17:37.588
of here kind of thing, you know. If you were, could 
see yourself as a member of that group today, how

17:37.768 --> 17:46.641
would you think you would look back on old Sarge 
Gardner? I'd be very happy with him. You think that

17:50.767 --> 17:52.069
he prepared them? Do you think that Gartner 
prepared you for combat, wherever you went? You

17:57.779 --> 18:12.035
went off with a spirit, or you went off...

17:57.779 --> 18:12.035
You know, when we talk about combat, whatever 
their weaponry was, I thought I did a good job. But

18:12.296 --> 18:17.702
whether that, you know, the actual application, I 
don't know. Like, if you knew how to ski in Russia,

18:18.104 --> 18:22.430
certainly it was an advantage to you. If you knew 
certain steps that other people didn't know, I can

18:23.171 --> 18:27.836
get away from you where the other guy can't. So I 
always felt skills is going to be your survival, no

18:28.577 --> 18:35.506
matter where you are. To improve your skills, to 
pay attention, to look alive, that's all we really

18:36.608 --> 18:44.618
did, to kind of shake him up and, you know, you 
paying attention? Are you with me? You know, type

18:47.947 --> 18:49.288
of thing. Because half of them, I'm sure, didn't 
want to be there. Did you? Well, it seemed like,

18:55.658 --> 19:01.146
yeah, I wanted to be there because the 
alternatives, there were no alternatives. I

19:01.646 --> 19:02.408
couldn't be home. So, you know, if you give me an 
alternative, attractive alternatives, maybe,

19:02.948 --> 19:10.159
but there were none. When did you want to become an 
officer? Well, I You know, came from, like I said,

19:14.888 --> 19:26.783
from an area that had a lot of tradition in the 
military, and of course wanted to be an officer

19:14.888 --> 19:26.783
badly. And all, in my school, you know, as soon as 
you graduated, you were sent automatically to

19:27.504 --> 19:34.853
officer school. My other friend, Horst Trispel, 
was already an officer. So, and of course, we had

19:42.382 --> 19:44.625
the Prussian tradition of famous officers. My 
hometown,

19:49.655 --> 19:55.326
Manfred von Richthofen was born. I saw his, I met 
his mother, saw his plane. The Red Baron. Numerous

20:05.378 --> 20:08.062
generals. I mean, so it's a militaristic, it's 
almost the yonkers, what they call. Oh, another

20:12.888 --> 20:19.077
friend I should mention at that point, when I say 
yonkers, he sat behind me in class. His name is Von

20:20.018 --> 20:21.861
Lieres. L-I-E-R-E-S. Von Lieres. And I guess you 
would describe him as a yonker. Actually, what he

20:30.352 --> 20:32.415
was, they... they owned land. These, these von, 
von Richthofen, most of them, there were some poor

20:35.121 --> 20:45.275
ones and there were some not so poor ones, you know, 
depending on which land they owned. And, so, and he

20:46.237 --> 21:00.236
liked me and he would ask me to come out to his estate 
and if you had time you could look through Middle

20:46.237 --> 21:00.236
Schlesien and you see what these places look like. 
They're big, farmhouses, you see, those

21:02.399 --> 21:05.823
so-called estates. They have chicken, cows, and 
the whole thing, plus so many acres, and they

21:06.984 --> 21:16.254
raise, they might have farmers that work there. 
What is that called? Other people. They sub it out.

21:20.699 --> 21:21.339
Tenant farmers. Yeah, tenant farmers. So 
certainly it's a big tradition, a Yonker

21:22.821 --> 21:25.003
tradition. It's a big Yonker tradition. So Von 
Lear is this fellow and I. He used to invite me out

21:28.758 --> 21:30.622
for the weekend. And it's just a great big family, 
and chickens running around, and Mrs. Bond here is

21:34.910 --> 21:43.185
running around with her hair, trying to keep track 
of all this and feed everybody, feed the help, you

21:34.910 --> 21:43.185
know, in the kitchen. How much respect did you pay 
to these people? So

21:47.067 --> 21:55.398
these people held a high level in the community. 
Oh, yeah, but this kind of thing is done to your

21:56.039 --> 22:00.405
college professor. Yes, of course. But I'm trying 
to assess your level of respect for military

22:01.686 --> 22:12.360
heritage

22:01.686 --> 22:12.360
for a number of reasons. One is with what intensity 
did you go into the military? With what intensity

22:17.105 --> 22:23.434
then did it affect you to find yourself captured? 
And with what intensity then did you have to break

22:23.474 --> 22:26.298
all those ties? How deep were those ties that you 
would have to later amputate?

22:34.129 --> 22:46.386
If you were to meet a military officer now, you 
wouldn't feel that same respect that you would

22:34.129 --> 22:46.386
have felt then, which indicates that the 
amputation was complete.

22:48.053 --> 22:59.967
So when you met these people, it was nod the head and 
startles there, because these were fun, so and so.

23:00.668 --> 23:01.669
Yeah. And I always thought that this kind of 
behavior was a

23:01.689 --> 23:12.322
courtesy kind of thing. It was not a It did not say 
that I was odd, or it did not give anything away

23:13.568 --> 23:22.881
from, take not anything away from me as a person. 
Oh, yes, right. That I would bow, just because I

23:24.883 --> 23:30.411
bowed from the waist of whichever we were doing it, 
I don't remember. I don't mean to say that it means

23:31.272 --> 23:39.063
anything more than how deeply ingrained were the 
traditions that you then had to break. I grew up

23:40.545 --> 23:42.968
with exactly the same philosophy. were not too 
hard to break, especially since we had this

23:43.387 --> 23:51.055
breakdown of discipline in the camps. There was 
already a 50% breakdown. We were amongst our own

23:54.338 --> 23:59.623
kind, and we did not have to salute each other. So 
for a couple of years, it was

24:00.224 --> 24:11.655
almost nonexistent except to just the frame of the 
whole thing. We might salute the American

24:11.855 --> 24:18.341
officers, and we give it as just a form of... 
Military courtesy. Military courtesy, and it

24:18.361 --> 24:20.302
means nothing. You could just, if you wanted to, go 
like this afterwards. Yeah, but you always did.

24:25.387 --> 24:25.847
Yeah. It's a matter of recognition. Oh, yeah, I 
understand. So, you know, but it's just like once I

24:30.852 --> 24:40.360
learned the customs and the forms of greetings in 
this country, I'm a social animal that I enjoy

24:40.880 --> 24:55.597
doing the social amenities to get along. I don't 
want to start a fight just walking into a room. No,

24:58.200 --> 25:00.082
no, no, of course. Did you see any of your own 
officers in the camp? Or your own officers were in a

25:02.765 --> 25:04.747
different company? No, they were in a different 
company. They were separated. So you generally

25:06.550 --> 25:09.313
didn't see your own officers. So there was no 
discipline involved. from the outside except

25:10.883 --> 25:17.994
either what you offered to the American 
commanders.

25:22.301 --> 25:30.214
But one sergeant every evening started a meeting 
about putting up bulletins and war news and things

25:22.301 --> 25:30.214
that have to be done on the post. Yeah, the usual 
bureaucracy evolves. People tend to create

25:38.947 --> 25:41.976
paperwork and keep busy with... But you wouldn't 
have saluted the sergeant that called the

25:43.901 --> 25:48.535
meeting? If you had to make a report, for instance, 
like you see now on television, when somebody

25:49.493 --> 26:10.295
comes, let's say a speaker is introducing 
somebody, he'll say this, gives them an

25:49.493 --> 26:10.295
introduction, and then he'll turn, and then he'll 
bow, and it's an animalistic way of ushering the

25:49.493 --> 26:10.295
next one in. So if I say, how many men do you have in 
your barracks? I might say, I have 39 men. And that

26:17.022 --> 26:18.324
makes it official. Right. If I just say I have 39 
men, you might think I'm just guessing. After

26:26.263 --> 26:38.670
the assassination of Hitler's life in July of 
1944, the German army introduced the

26:26.263 --> 26:38.670
outstretched arms salute. and made it mandatory 
for German soldiers. I didn't know that. I often

26:42.801 --> 26:48.048
wondered when I saw those pictures, and I kept 
telling Gene, I said, we never... No, there was

26:42.801 --> 26:48.048
nothing like that. I can't believe that. I said, I 
have never seen that. Yeah, it was made mandatory

26:51.572 --> 27:02.025
in the camps after July, or at least a lot of the 
camps adopted that out of sympathy for those close

26:51.572 --> 27:02.025
call. But nothing like that happened at the camp. 
There wasn't a high level of political activity

27:04.253 --> 27:08.182
after him. There must not have been, because I just 
heard it from you. Because I questioned it in those

27:12.671 --> 27:16.619
pictures I saw in your book. I said, that can't be. 
Old camps. I said, we never did. And we never

27:20.207 --> 27:23.794
saluted without a hat. You had said that the camps 
were being separated, that when you'd get

27:24.162 --> 27:34.718
transferred, it had to do with affiliations and 
things that you didn't know at the time. So maybe

27:34.738 --> 27:38.945
some camps got so different from other camps. Must 
have been, yeah. But we had, I know, when I see some

27:41.930 --> 27:47.698
of those things, you know, like without a cap, you 
don't salute at all. No, not covered. Let me ask

27:51.985 --> 27:52.566
you, Once you decided to become an officer, you 
realized that you had to get combat experience in

27:52.900 --> 27:59.990
order to be promoted. So you waited for an 
opportunity, and there's an opportunity on the

28:00.010 --> 28:03.255
bulletin board. Volunteers wanted for Africa 
Corps. I actually came, it was, I think the other

28:06.359 --> 28:17.315
way around it was, I finally somehow, they keep 
probably going through their records. Yes. And I

28:18.416 --> 28:21.861
have a feeling that somehow somebody fouled up 
Because in my soul book,

28:22.111 --> 28:29.361
I was once in it as a mason. And then somebody 
scratched a line through it and put down student.

28:36.190 --> 28:41.217
Because I was constantly, like I say, nothing ever 
happened to me. And they must have gone and taken a

28:42.310 --> 28:44.332
sweep. They probably needed new officer 
material, and they looked at their records or

28:44.392 --> 28:58.327
something, and they said I was appointed 
officer's candidate, which is K-O-V. I became a

28:58.348 --> 29:02.993
K-O-V. From that time on, you got special 
training. Also there in Mannheim? Yeah, in

29:05.856 --> 29:11.642
Mannheim, and then I was sent to the school in 
Heidelberg, and from there, Now you, they

29:12.061 --> 29:26.664
evaluated you there at the end and then

29:12.061 --> 29:26.664
you were assigned to combat and experience. That 
was your requisite for being promoted. And then

29:33.354 --> 29:35.758
you saw assignments at African Corps Volunteer 
Committee? At the end of the training at

29:35.778 --> 29:38.322
Heidelberg. Then into the African Corps. Then you 
were inducted and you went to the African Corps.

29:43.159 --> 29:44.601
Did you have to have special training for that? No. 
It was just another assignment, special

29:46.563 --> 29:49.507
uniforms. So you got special uniforms. And then 
you started on your way down Yugoslavia? Yeah.

29:57.058 --> 29:59.601
Yugoslavia to Athens. Right. How did you get to 
Italy? Because you saw the port. I believe

30:04.688 --> 30:07.532
after... I had to be taken off the plane in Crete 
because of my diarrhea and illness. This is going

30:16.396 --> 30:19.319
down, after going down Yugoslavia? Going to 
Athens, Greece, and just a few days until the

30:19.339 --> 30:25.746
planes get ready, I guess. Trying to catch up with 
Rommel's army at Tobruk. There you think the

30:29.791 --> 30:33.115
battle was already on. No, we were not told. We 
didn't get any newspapers

30:35.981 --> 30:42.896
or anything. You were in Crete. Yeah, we were in 
Crete. And then as soon as I recovered, I'm trying

30:46.062 --> 30:54.360
to wreck my memory how I got back to So quickly, 
because I didn't take the same freight cattle

30:54.998 --> 31:05.595
train back that took forever through Yugoslavia 
and stuff. Whether they flew me, I don't think they

31:05.655 --> 31:07.718
flew me. I would have gotten sick again. Maybe a 
better train, faster train or something that they

31:09.461 --> 31:15.390
got me back and then into a new unit and down to 
Italy. Still in the African port. Still in the

31:17.994 --> 31:19.757
African port. And outside of Naples, while we were 
waiting again, we got a pass to go to Pompeii and to

31:20.733 --> 31:29.726
see the Pope. Did you go with a bunch of friends, or 
were you just on your own? Yeah, a bunch of friends.

31:33.552 --> 31:37.979
It was more of a controlled guided tour. And you saw 
Pope Pius XII? People came out and blessed the

31:42.586 --> 31:46.296
crowd and blessed the road. And I sent it back and I 
think I would send one to Maria up because I knew she

31:46.416 --> 31:53.354
was a good captain. She would like it. Also, here's 
a girl who's building up her expectations. Not

31:57.993 --> 32:01.657
only a weekend in the country, but a blessed rosary 
on top of it. No, no. Sharia? No, no, no weekend in

32:03.198 --> 32:05.200
the country. Oh, oh. The other one in that case. 
This thing may be, we could sell this to Hustler.

32:14.070 --> 32:24.220
All right,

32:14.070 --> 32:24.220
so then from Italy, somehow you were transferred 
finally down to Toulouse. Yeah, the Tobruk. The

32:26.552 --> 32:29.295
Tobruk. East of Tobruk. You were flown down or went 
by ship, do you recall? I believe it was ship and

32:35.302 --> 32:37.124
truck. Ship to North Africa and then truck took you 
across the desert. I'm just trying to feel this

32:41.689 --> 32:47.416
thing so I don't have any really old periods 
missing. Yeah. Okay, so you're at Tobruk, and then

32:47.909 --> 32:53.417
starts the whole process of artillery. Battle, 
artillery barrages and stops and new foxholes

32:53.437 --> 32:58.784
every night or every other night. And you're in the 
retreat. In a retreat. It's just a hit-and-run

33:01.448 --> 33:04.853
kind of operation. It was a large unit you were with 
or a small unit? The battalion has four guns. There

33:11.482 --> 33:15.007
may have been another battalion nearby. Mm-hmm. 
But everything was fairly stretched out. Were

33:17.920 --> 33:22.410
you ever strafed by? Oh, constantly, by a P-38 that 
bombed overhead with these B-52s on their runs.

33:30.027 --> 33:34.217
They came and just rained it down like a... an 
orchard of trees, those things come off, you know.

33:44.375 --> 33:47.298
Let me interrupt, but I think that, I'm talking 
about the P-38, and I think you mentioned that

33:44.375 --> 33:47.298
years later, you can serve salad out of it. Salad 
out of it. Oh, yes, that's right. That plastic,

33:49.140 --> 33:50.602
that nose cone. Yes, I never made that connection. 
And all these... I hadn't made that connection,

33:52.524 --> 33:53.885
that's cute. And all those, oh yeah, and all those 
WW2 vets, you know, they were the most gracious

33:53.905 --> 34:01.032
people in the world. invited me to their Fourth of 
July party with this marvelous green salad and a

34:01.383 --> 34:10.812
P-38 plastic nose cone. I asked him, what is this? 
You're seeing it from a different perspective.

34:15.756 --> 34:16.457
Yes, yes. Yeah, with the machine guns going at you, 
you know, spitting out those bullets. And I hated

34:21.421 --> 34:24.584
that plane. I recognized it anywhere. Was the 
salad good? The salad was excellent. California

34:29.041 --> 34:30.864
style. California style. So you were strafed by 
planes? And bombed. And bombed. The B-52 bombers

34:36.853 --> 34:40.398
that came from nowhere. 10, 20, 30. You could 
hardly see them. They were that high. But you knew

34:45.566 --> 34:47.629
you could hear them come down. And they would lay 
down these patterns.

34:53.105 --> 35:01.795
So, and no German fighter plane in the sky to, you 
know, and very little resistance. Did you ever get

35:02.435 --> 35:10.424
morale lectures from

35:02.435 --> 35:10.424
political officers that came around and gave you a 
pep talk? Never seen a political officer. I'm

35:13.347 --> 35:14.769
honest, honestly. Never seen one. They may have 
had them. Yeah, they came around the units to give

35:17.292 --> 35:19.854
morale to the men. Okay, so you are, morale is 
dropping quickly. Yes and no. I think the German,

35:25.814 --> 35:29.218
that's one of the things, you know, you just take 
it. Then you get kind of stoic. That's it. That's

35:33.623 --> 35:34.443
the way it is. And you just go out and do your thing. 
Was there a lull and then the surrender? Or was it a

35:41.031 --> 35:45.916
barrage, barrage, barrage, and then the 
surrender came right after? Yeah. Pretty shortly

35:46.997 --> 35:49.160
after barrage, yeah. And finally, somebody had 
made an arrangement to surrender. You didn't know

35:51.762 --> 35:53.464
who it was? You didn't have anything to do with it? 
As a matter of fact, this particular unit is called

35:55.688 --> 36:00.855
Storm Artillery. My father mentioned it 
somewhere in this newspaper advertisement that

36:00.875 --> 36:10.889
it was attached to a storm artillery, which is 
slightly different, I think. I don't think we had

36:10.909 --> 36:13.953
any infantry in front of us. We had nothing, just a 
desert. So

36:15.836 --> 36:20.723
you just moved around and... tried to scare the 
other guy into thinking you were something or you

36:21.125 --> 36:26.797
were bigger than you were or whatever. And

36:26.837 --> 36:41.547
I have never, except a gentleman came around, a 
gentleman came around once, kind of a short guy

36:26.837 --> 36:41.547
with a red thing on his pants and, you know, 
everywhere. And they're usually feisty little

36:41.898 --> 36:44.082
guys. They have a little pep talk, a little smile, 
and that kind of thing. And that's the only guy that

36:52.335 --> 36:58.685
ever really... My officer, I never saw him. They 
were always up front on some mountain with their

36:58.705 --> 37:04.935
radio man. you know, looking and directing the 
fire. That's why we're talking about, you know,

37:08.699 --> 37:16.228
this stretched out, this, you know, none of this 
compression of people, you know. We didn't have

37:16.388 --> 37:17.109
that. If you looked up, out of your foxhole, you saw 
absolutely nothing. Did you make any close army

37:22.035 --> 37:24.839
buddies while you were there? Friends that you may 
have Surrendered with and gone to camp with

37:27.713 --> 37:53.687
because these kinds of crises bring people 
together Yeah, someone's shooting at you and

37:27.713 --> 37:53.687
there's somebody nearby you get to know that 
person pretty quickly Yeah, but the thing is you

37:27.713 --> 37:53.687
were not allowed in a foxhole with anybody That is 
pretty strange thing that people I never see that

37:27.713 --> 37:53.687
anywhere that this is The most important thing in 
that kind of warfare and that you do not have a buddy

37:53.903 --> 38:18.004
in your foxhole because i see it in these movies all 
the time four or five guys that get so close like

37:53.903 --> 38:18.004
crime and he thinks it would have been unheard of 
you were not allowed i see a lot of isolation from

37:53.903 --> 38:18.004
from yeah one end to the other even even in your in 
under fire you were almost yeah i i'm just as

37:53.903 --> 38:18.004
interested in what you're saying you know Because 
it's not like the pictures from Vietnam where you

38:18.423 --> 38:25.630
see two soldiers hugging each other and crying, or 
mud streaked and bleeding. This is a very... Yeah,

38:26.251 --> 38:30.275
only if somebody was hurt, you know. Were there a 
lot of people hurt that you remember? Not too, no.

38:33.237 --> 38:39.444
Because it had to almost be a direct hit of one 
foxhole. If the thing hit 20 or 30 feet away, if you

38:39.464 --> 38:48.092
had a decent foxhole, you probably got away with 
getting a few rocks thrown at you you know and

38:48.612 --> 39:08.275
everything else went about you and you got a new 
foxhole there and you got a foxhole right from the

38:48.612 --> 39:08.275
yeah yeah and it's a good one because they can never 
hit that spot again yeah yeah they cannot right at

38:48.612 --> 39:08.275
least in those days they couldn't tell it's in the 
rule book somewhere yeah uh how long did this go on

39:08.491 --> 39:16.808
How long, from the time you got to Africa, I can 
check on the soul book, but about how long do you

39:08.491 --> 39:16.808
remember it going on? About four months, three or 
four months. Three or four months in Africa. Then

39:20.456 --> 39:26.128
comes barrages, barrages, barrages, and someone 
informs you that it's... just lay low, we're going

39:26.851 --> 39:30.481
to surrender, and someone's going to come around 
for us. Yeah, and actually, within a day or two, at

39:30.681 --> 39:38.903
first I had my orders to report to Berlin, and then 
within a few hours or a day next, hold everything.

39:40.681 --> 39:42.203
We were surrounded, cut off. We are waiting for 
their orders. Stay in your foxhole. So there you

39:48.010 --> 39:53.996
are reading that book in your foxhole and donated 
by the German Red Cross. By the German Red Cross.

39:56.439 --> 40:02.546
And it's just a lovely, lovely story of hope and 
love. You know, man, woman, love. Very

40:06.871 --> 40:08.232
fundamental thing that I needed at that time. The 
humanistic side of people rather than the war,

40:12.797 --> 40:23.817
which by that time was gone. Were you writing to 
your parents while they were in New England? I may

40:26.983 --> 40:31.992
have, but I doubt if I wrote too much because we were 
really on the run. And I was, to be honest with you, I

40:32.613 --> 40:38.947
was pretty scared most of the time. Sure, sure. I 
didn't even say anything. I just think that

40:40.430 --> 40:48.347
something is going to, some red hot piece is going 
to tear you apart and mostly maim you. Yes. I was

40:49.530 --> 40:51.634
always terrified. It's amazing, like, you know, 
in those fragments, you can hear them sing, you

40:51.614 --> 40:59.387
know, around after the impact. Those are the best 
scary moments. First, of course, the impact. And

41:03.474 --> 41:04.917
that scares the hell out of you. But then come the 
fragment, and that high whine, and you can almost

41:04.937 --> 41:09.445
see them red hot. Oh, yes, yeah. You know, you can 
almost visualize them by the sound. They had to be

41:14.446 --> 41:16.929
red-hot steel. And then you said, Jesus Christ, 
they're going to take half of one of those buggers.

41:21.755 --> 41:26.761
They're going to tear the nastiest hole into you 
that you can imagine. No religious moments at

41:26.781 --> 41:29.344
times like that. Those are the moments when you 
start probing your values and religious, making

41:30.025 --> 41:42.039
deals with God, as my mother does when my brother's 
orders came through. Do you remember any...

41:45.918 --> 41:57.749
sitting there doing the catechism, or sitting 
there and... My reaction to something like that

41:45.918 --> 41:57.749
is, who in the hell screwed this whole thing up? To 
get us into that kind of... How can that ever be?

42:03.335 --> 42:04.416
That sounds pretty sane to me. Who is doing this? 
Let me ask, when you went to school, when you were in

42:10.322 --> 42:14.946
school, before you went into the service, What 
were your best subjects, do you recall? English.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.606
German second, maybe. And of course, athletics. 
Mathematics. Math also, second.

42:37.419 --> 42:40.883
So I was pretty much of an A minus. Right. Pretty 
much across sometimes straight As, but not very

42:43.891 --> 42:46.481
often. There's always a minus here and there. And 
did you finish? I went to the Obersekunde when I had

42:50.600 --> 42:56.250
diphtheria. And I was out of school for all year. 
Which is why you couldn't become an officer going

42:59.495 --> 43:02.400
directly from school. Yeah, right, going 
directly from school. And I could not catch up with

43:04.163 --> 43:11.896
the class after me because they had now French, and 
they had changed the curriculum behind me without

43:04.163 --> 43:11.896
asking me. Because if it had been the same 
curriculum, all I had to do was do it over again.

43:16.504 --> 43:16.624
Right. and catch up for that one year. And I only 
missed it by, I remember my gym teacher said,

43:19.332 --> 43:25.200
Dennis, if I'd known that... He didn't say Dennis, 
but let's go with that. He took me aside, we were

43:28.264 --> 43:41.281
doing broad jumps that day, and my physical 
ability wasn't, I was below my distances and

43:28.264 --> 43:41.281
everything, falling off from sickness a little 
bit, but I was coming back. If I'd known it was that

43:41.341 --> 43:46.408
close, we could have done something, you know, he 
said, you know. So dropped out that last year.

43:49.782 --> 43:49.883
Yeah. Not unlike your dropping out last year, so. 
Yeah. Yeah, and then my father wanted that we tried

43:54.668 --> 43:59.755
that class and simply could not. It wasn't only 
that they had French as a major, they seemed to have

44:00.195 --> 44:06.403
a hold of math and everything had changed. From 
about, they had gotten a new direction and it's

44:08.005 --> 44:11.629
just a different curriculum. And I always was so 
jealous of of the American school system when I

44:14.300 --> 44:19.305
heard that you had your units and what you had, you 
kept. All you had to do is go somewhere else and make

44:19.745 --> 44:22.668
up what you didn't have. That made so much more 
sense. Yeah. I paid $2 for the fingertips. Let me

44:32.337 --> 44:37.662
ask you, as close as it was, could your father not 
have pulled some strings? I get the feeling your

44:37.823 --> 44:39.885
father was a very important man in town. Yes. He's a 
Eisenbahnmeister or that was. Yeah, but he was

44:47.688 --> 44:49.631
gone so much on his train. He had odd hours, 
sometimes overnight trips. So he wasn't really

44:52.976 --> 44:54.478
that powerful. In fact, now that you've mentioned 
it, it's a good point. You're very intuitive.

44:58.804 --> 45:04.472
Because I was really a little upset with my father 
for not doing something and checking up on it. that

45:04.840 --> 45:09.769
I was in this no-win situation and was having 
difficulties. And of course, maybe it may have

45:10.631 --> 45:12.855
been my fault. I didn't communicate enough. I 
don't know. But you certainly thought he was

45:15.380 --> 45:18.286
powerful enough to be able to do something. Yeah, 
yeah. He says, if we had had some conferences,

45:18.762 --> 45:25.551
maybe with some of the teachers, we could have 
ironed out something about this. And we did have a

45:26.111 --> 45:30.817
talk, if I remember exactly. And then he said, 
well, I'm sorry, or something to that effect. But I

45:33.981 --> 45:38.427
said, no, no on that. And I said, well, what are we 
going to do now? OK, then how about trying to, there

45:40.590 --> 45:46.137
was a nearby town that, at that time, It was more 
similar, he thought, but it had girls in it, co-ed

45:47.045 --> 45:56.462
school in a town maybe 20, 30 miles away. And I tried 
that, and they had a curriculum that I didn't fit

45:57.644 --> 46:06.841
too well, did not make it. Then he said we'd go.
