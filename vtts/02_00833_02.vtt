00:08.165 --> 00:24.115
Mrs. Grace Jackson, Bryan, Texas, 83 years old, 
interviewed Monday, 24th of March, 1975, by Adela

00:08.165 --> 00:24.115
Lopez and Jim Crisp.

00:37.949 --> 00:46.747
Excuse me, Mrs. Jackson, could you tell us just a 
little bit about where you're from or a little bit

00:37.949 --> 00:46.747
about yourself or what brought you here in the 
first place? How far back? Where I'm from?

00:50.434 --> 00:50.976
Directly? Yes, ma'am. To here? Oh, we came here 
from Rush, Texas. That's where the insane asylum

00:57.912 --> 01:00.278
is. I'm glad to get out.

01:06.616 --> 01:06.896
Pardon? Where is Rust? Rust? It's in East Texas. 
East Texas? Close to Kilgore and Henderson,

01:10.145 --> 01:13.474
around that territory. Is that where y'all's 
family was from before? No, no, no. You see, my

01:18.447 --> 01:24.716
husband was a Methodist minister, and that's why I 
asked you how far back I must go, because we were

01:18.447 --> 01:24.716
gypsies. We went wherever the bishop sent us. We 
just gypsied from the coast all over the world, you

01:28.983 --> 01:34.631
know, to different places. That was where we came 
from here. Where was your... Family from? Okay,

01:41.325 --> 01:43.248
from Arkansas. Arkansas. Lead Hill, Arkansas, 
that's right. And then we spent most of our lives at

01:46.051 --> 01:59.486
the Fed of Arkansas, where the Razorbacks are, 
that whipped us in the basketball, and we didn't

01:46.051 --> 01:59.486
like it.

02:02.550 --> 02:04.352
Joe, what caused Joe? To come here just because a 
bishop sent you here? Yes. They changed at that

02:08.683 --> 02:10.205
time. It was a rule in our church that we move every 
four years. So when our four years was up at Russ,

02:14.251 --> 02:18.076
they sent us here. They appointed us here. We had no 
idea where we would go until we went to conference.

02:23.044 --> 02:30.615
And when they sent us, they told us that it was a 
boys' school and they were sending us here

02:23.044 --> 02:30.615
primarily to work with the boys. And you'll be 
surprised to know there's only 900 here then. And I

02:36.074 --> 02:40.478
thought, oh my soul, 900 boys, what'll I do with 
them? And they were all khaki-clad then, you know.

02:44.342 --> 02:47.726
And it was, well, it was just military. But I 
decided the only thing I could do would be to just

02:48.867 --> 02:55.473
make a Christian home for them. And most of them 
called me mom. And they felt just as free to come to

02:59.557 --> 03:05.423
my kitchen and go to my refrigerator as they did in 
their own homes. Are you referring to the boys out

03:07.192 --> 03:09.255
of A&M? Referring to the boys of A&M. And what a 
change there's been since then. And there was just

03:15.223 --> 03:16.585
900 boys? Just 900 boys. But I thought I never saw as 
many boys in all my life. And for things that, you

03:22.653 --> 03:27.439
know, people weren't as fluent then as they are 
now. Very few of them had cars. So we had open house

03:29.502 --> 03:33.247
for them on Wednesday night. They were out. They 
could stay out later. See... At that time, they

03:36.622 --> 03:40.247
just did everything between military pistols. 
But they could stay out later on Wednesday nights

03:41.248 --> 03:44.773
and on Sunday nights. So those were the nights that 
I had them in my home. And we just played all kinds of

03:48.738 --> 03:54.826
games and did things like that. And I will say this. 
I never had one to cross my threshold that wasn't a

03:56.748 --> 04:03.497
perfect gentleman. And that's saying a lot. In 
four years' time, They never used a cuss word. They

04:09.086 --> 04:09.687
were never. And another thing that we were so proud 
of at that time, oh, a big class distinction. You

04:17.855 --> 04:20.958
know, freshman, senior, what have you. But when 
they came to our house, everybody was on a level. We

04:26.424 --> 04:27.345
had no seniors. We had no freshmen. We were just all 
one. We enjoyed our work with them so much. And we

04:36.342 --> 04:42.308
had them, I remember one night down there, I forget 
how many countries there was representing. Oh,

04:44.710 --> 04:51.737
just Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and India, and 
Japan, and China. They were just from all over the

04:52.738 --> 04:54.139
world. These two plaques here, and that one over 
there is from Japan. These are from China. And

05:02.146 --> 05:05.910
those people are great on giving gifts. And they 
all went home for Christmas and these boys were so

05:06.160 --> 05:14.841
far away they couldn't get there and back if they 
had the money to go. It cost something to go that

05:14.881 --> 05:16.424
far. So we bought the biggest turkey we could find 
and had 12 of them down home. That's just about all I

05:24.503 --> 05:27.948
could accommodate them on for dinner. And you 
know, I got gifts for the rest of the time we was

05:28.068 --> 05:32.894
here. Every Christmas they'd send me, they'd 
still send me gifts. And these are some of them.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.922
This was a beautiful dress. You know, they were all 
married. They were married, their people married

05:40.765 --> 05:43.769
them. They were like the ten, who did they call 
them? You know what I'm trying to say? They had

05:50.844 --> 05:56.050
matchmakers, you know, over there at 12 and 10. So 
this was the dress that one of their wives

05:56.671 --> 06:02.437
selected. It fit her. He said I was about the size of 
his wife. And we used it for all the dances. And the

06:08.484 --> 06:10.586
girls would borrow it and have the pictures made. 
They were just running it. So I had it cut up, the

06:12.388 --> 06:14.731
skirt. I still have the blouse, perfectly 
beautiful. What

06:18.588 --> 06:26.223
was it like when you first got here? Oh! It looked 
like a desert. A desert? Well, yes. We came from

06:33.558 --> 06:38.067
East Texas, from these trees everywhere and 
houses. You know, it was a... It was just a place

06:40.424 --> 06:42.287
where everybody lived. And we got out here. There 
wasn't anything here but the college and that old

06:42.948 --> 06:46.854
main building. And the post office was clear 
across the railroad track over there, way across

06:47.755 --> 06:55.508
the railroad track, and a place just about as big as 
this living room. My husband got that changed. And

06:58.372 --> 07:04.782
there was no houses on this side of the campus at 
all, the north gate. There's one or two buildings

07:05.183 --> 07:07.967
at the north gate. We liked A&M so much that Mr. 
Jackson bought a tract of land from the north gate

07:08.892 --> 07:20.983
down to the Brine,

07:08.892 --> 07:20.983
down to the city of Brine. He bought nine acres 
right in there. And you know, before we could build

07:23.426 --> 07:28.130
a house on it, we had to put on our own lives, water, 
and gas. We had to put all that in ourselves to get it

07:29.131 --> 07:34.076
to our own home. And of course, everybody that 
hooked on then as the town grew. Everybody hooked

07:40.549 --> 07:42.652
on, tied on to ours. We eventually got our money 
back and made a little bit, but that's how barren

07:42.772 --> 07:48.859
everything. My house was the only one on that side 
of the house, and you want to know how come you

07:48.899 --> 07:54.005
didn't get that house? They had a load of 
three-room parsons in the bath that the former

07:55.046 --> 08:05.578
pastor had used, and they wanted to sell it and 
build the pastor a decent home. So they had Dodgers

08:06.672 --> 08:09.097
struck. Those little old Leafers just give out, 
you know, having an auction. And there's been an

08:12.603 --> 08:14.968
auction that three-room house off. It was a real 
cold day, and you know, people aren't very

08:16.009 --> 08:20.057
responsive when it's cold. So my husband thought, 
well, he'd just make a bid on it just to get it

08:20.257 --> 08:25.965
started. And you know what happened? He bid $100, 
and one of our members was there, and he just

08:28.829 --> 08:35.419
wriggled around through that audience like a 
snake. He said, don't outbid that preacher. It's

08:37.682 --> 08:41.027
not worth any more than that. He said, let him have 
it. I don't know what he wants with it. But he said,

08:43.470 --> 08:45.012
let him have it if he wants. And wouldn't anybody 
outbid us? And there he was with that thing on his

08:47.611 --> 08:50.475
hand. We didn't have an inch of ground in the world 
to set it on. And it had to be off by a certain time.

08:56.083 --> 09:03.093
You see, that was the main idea was to get rid of the 
thing, get it off the lot there so they could build

08:56.083 --> 09:03.093
the other one. So we had time to find anybody to sell 
us any land. Boyd owned most of it on that side of

09:08.782 --> 09:12.026
town. And he was only allowed to sell. enough to pay 
the taxes. See, it was all tied up in the state. So he

09:20.138 --> 09:24.644
was allowed to sell enough to pay his taxes. And 
that's how we got four or five little lots over

09:24.664 --> 09:29.131
there to set that house on. Well, then you live 
pretty close to the campus because Boyett Street

09:29.531 --> 09:35.520
is just on this side of University Drive. Pardon? 
You live right on the other side. Oh, yes. See, I

09:39.125 --> 09:41.748
just live two blocks from the post office. My 
apartment's, I have 13 apartments over there now.

09:45.087 --> 09:54.442
And before we got that little old three-room house 
moved down there, everybody in town tried to rent.

09:54.462 --> 09:56.004
You know, there wasn't any apartments around 
here. No, no, nothing. And everybody was trying to

09:58.589 --> 10:01.072
find a place to live. And so Mr. Jackson conceived 
the idea that if they were that much in demand, he'd

10:01.253 --> 10:09.566
just get it down there and make it a two-story 
house. And he did, and it's been around ever since.

10:12.273 --> 10:19.149
And then we built our own home on the big corner lot. 
Eight bedrooms and five baths. And I kept those

10:22.016 --> 10:24.060
girls. They didn't have any motels or hotels. or 
anything and so when the boys had their dates they

10:27.832 --> 10:49.418
had to stay in private homes and I could keep 16 you 
see easy and the night you know they built that slab

10:27.832 --> 10:49.418
over there you know where I'm talking about the 
slab where they had the outdoor dance I don't know

10:27.832 --> 10:49.418
how you do or not it's over there in that old shell 
looking building close to the Well, okay, the

10:49.398 --> 10:53.443
night that opened up, I had eight cots. My living 
room was bigger than this over there. And I had

10:56.566 --> 10:58.449
eight cots just right along there. And I slept in 
the kitchen on the cot. Everybody wanted to come,

11:02.173 --> 11:05.237
and there was nowhere to put them. And mothers 
would call me from Galveston or San Antonio or

11:05.257 --> 11:15.709
anywhere, and they said, well, they all knew I was a 
minister's wife, and they knew I run a decent

11:05.257 --> 11:15.709
place. And they'd say, I don't care where you put 
her. Just let her sleep anywhere, just so I know

11:18.824 --> 11:21.588
she's down there with you. And that's what we had. 
And so I didn't know that my son and Mr. Jackson were

11:23.692 --> 11:28.138
coming. And lo and behold, about the time the girls 
were all dressing and so on, here came my husband.

11:34.629 --> 11:37.493
He was pastor of a church in Houston. And so... When 
they came, there wasn't a place anywhere in the

11:41.862 --> 11:47.671
house they could go without seeing your old woman 
anywhere. They had to drive clear back to Houston.

11:50.014 --> 11:54.281
My own husband and my own son couldn't find a place 
to stay in college. Dad said, if you ever do this

11:55.062 --> 11:57.946
again, you don't have to do that. And I said, well, 
they just kept coming. I didn't know what to do, and

11:59.488 --> 12:01.311
I didn't know you were coming. And while I was here 
in Mr. Jackson and Houston, I must explain that.

12:08.221 --> 12:10.705
See, that was right after I'd gotten out of the 
hospital. And I couldn't do my, I couldn't play my

12:11.393 --> 12:15.118
role as a minister's wife. I tried it. I went down 
there with him after the appointment was made in

12:16.701 --> 12:19.905
Houston. And, oh, every time I do anything, the 
church, they'd send me back to the hospital. So the

12:25.954 --> 12:32.703
bishop, the man that was out right over us, he said, 
don't you have a relative? Couldn't you send her

12:32.763 --> 12:34.686
anywhere? I said, she just can't do this. I said, it 
would kill her. I took everything so seriously

12:37.310 --> 12:40.995
because I love my work and We worked many times and 
never would do a bid. So we conceived the idea of me

12:44.707 --> 12:51.396
coming up here and running that house instead of 
renting it out. So that's why I was here and my

12:52.778 --> 12:54.561
husband was down there. I want to make that clear. 
But, oh, I had so many rich and rare and real

12:58.145 --> 13:07.638
experiences in that house, both with the boys and 
the girls. It was just a... I'd always wanted a

13:10.338 --> 13:14.906
girl, and I had the sweetest little red-headed boy 
you ever did see. But then once I had all the girls

13:15.828 --> 13:23.883
and boys, too, I could manage.

13:24.103 --> 13:30.355
Was there any big happenings here, like any of the 
floods or anything? Or drafts that you remember

13:30.706 --> 13:33.892
that really affected your job? No, we were here 
during the Depression, but that's like it is now.

13:38.701 --> 13:41.226
The people on the campus don't know anything about 
it. They don't depend on crops failures and so on.

13:45.053 --> 13:49.662
They get their checks through the fiscal office 
just like they do now. We were here. No, we didn't

13:50.904 --> 13:53.389
have any drafts. How was the depression, though? I 
mean, the people on the campus? Well, the people on

13:57.959 --> 14:00.081
campus didn't know this having one. That's what I 
said. They got their checks every month anyway.

14:04.065 --> 14:09.491
And most of them lived on the campus in those 
faculty homes, you see. Most of them lived on

14:10.692 --> 14:12.213
campus. And so we didn't realize this having one. 
We got our check every month. They got theirs. See,

14:19.040 --> 14:22.043
a lot of these people that have to depend on their 
crops and their cattle and things like that. They

14:26.516 --> 14:29.220
do feel it, but we didn't have any of those kind of 
people here. We just had seven men on our fishing

14:29.821 --> 14:33.046
board at that time. Now they have between 50 and 60, 
I think. So you see, that's how things have been.

14:38.935 --> 14:40.918
Well, how did it affect the other people? I mean, 
besides, didn't it sort of slow down the work here?

14:44.864 --> 14:48.970
It slowed down with the boys, I think. They were 
pretty hard. The boys were kids harder than we did,

14:51.149 --> 14:58.144
and that's when they, well, I don't know how to 
express it. They had these what they called

15:00.149 --> 15:10.491
project houses, and they'd rent a great big house 
and put as many boys, and the college would rent the

15:00.149 --> 15:10.491
house, put a matron over it. and put as many boys in 
there as they could possibly squeeze in, bunk beds

15:10.910 --> 15:15.676
and what have you. And the only way they could go to 
school was to bring enough out of their deep

15:15.696 --> 15:26.651
freezers at home or enough eggs or butter or 
something to put in that kitchen. Every boy

15:26.711 --> 15:28.934
brought his share, you see. And then this lady that 
they had hired to run that thing cook and serve now

15:34.079 --> 15:58.669
that it did affect the boys that way because a lot of 
the boys couldn't come to school for what they call

15:34.079 --> 15:58.669
those project houses but and yet the boys that 
lived like that crowded areas and they'd go home

15:34.079 --> 15:58.669
intermittently and bring them back enough and you 
know what they'd do they'd bring me back a roast too

15:59.088 --> 16:01.531
I got fed like they did. And they just, and yet they 
made the best grades of anybody. They made the best

16:08.298 --> 16:10.120
grades of anybody. They realized, you know, what 
they were here for.

16:16.387 --> 16:20.811
Well, did it affect these businesses down in 
Bryan? I notice there's a lot of old businesses

16:20.852 --> 16:24.616
there that look like that. Well, they recently, 
it's just gradually deteriorated. When we were

16:28.990 --> 16:35.062
here, brine was at its height because it wasn't 
anything out of college, you see. There was no

16:35.482 --> 16:37.586
stores and things like that at college. Oh, just 
something here and there and yonder and in the

16:37.987 --> 16:41.754
mountains, anything. We all had to do all of our 
shopping at brine, even our, most of our

16:41.795 --> 16:47.265
groceries, we had to buy it down there. No, 
college-fed brine. You see, it always has. It

16:55.265 --> 16:57.327
still does. No, Brian has just gradually gone down 
because college has gone up. Everything's come

17:02.333 --> 17:05.316
this way, you see. No, I don't think Brian felt it 
like most towns do because they had college here to

17:06.317 --> 17:16.528
feed them. See, most towns didn't have that. And it 
did make a difference. But any churches here...

17:23.581 --> 17:32.245
Well, the Presbyterian Church and the Episcopal 
Church,

17:23.581 --> 17:32.245
I think they met in the YMCA. And the Lutheran 
Church met in what was once Guyon Hall. Of course,

17:39.055 --> 17:40.036
that's been torn down. You may not be familiar with 
that. But anyway, you see, it was a situation. They

17:47.203 --> 17:50.026
didn't have any school, any grammar school. I sent 
my son, Brian, to Allen Academy. Oh, they had just a

17:56.192 --> 18:02.599
low-frame building where the kids on the campus 
went, but it wasn't adequate. I wouldn't have sent

18:02.679 --> 18:04.060
mine there. The professors did because... Well, 
it moved them, too, to see. They were in a tough spot

18:09.269 --> 18:12.834
there, but I was in a different spot. So I sent mine, 
too. No, just everything has changed so much. But

18:19.903 --> 18:23.208
I'd rather you'd ask me the questions, because I 
don't know what you're going to do. But did it

18:23.228 --> 18:26.072
really start growing, or... Did the war really 
affect it after the Depression and then the war?

18:30.489 --> 18:30.850
Yes. When the war came, you've seen the plaque on 
the student center of how many boys. In fact, A&M

18:36.480 --> 18:39.867
boys won the war. And several of our boys that were 
the most faithful ones in the church gave their

18:40.928 --> 18:49.444
lives for your freedom and mine. One day here, 
there was two or three boys. We got messages of two

18:54.401 --> 18:57.145
or three the same day. The whole campus was in 
tears. Just the whole campus was in tears. Yes, it

19:01.811 --> 19:04.194
began to grow after that. The boys came home and 
business, you know, everywhere was just

19:06.397 --> 19:13.306
different. And the situations in their hometowns 
were different. You see, so it began to go right to

19:18.044 --> 19:21.308
that. And I just can't believe they got 20,000 out 
there. I just can't believe they got 20,000 boys

19:26.074 --> 19:30.239
out that college, and girls. And when we were here, 
there was four or five girls on the campus. Three of

19:35.185 --> 19:37.769
them were old maids, and the Aggies wouldn't look 
at them. They were too old. And the other three were

19:39.831 --> 19:42.895
high school girls, and they were too young. So when 
we had parties for the boys, And party was my middle

19:48.166 --> 19:49.689
name. We've always worked with young people. 
That's been my responsibility ever since we were

19:53.655 --> 19:56.260
married. And I figured if I played with them all 
week, they'd come and pray with me on Sunday. And

20:00.607 --> 20:00.908
they did. The house was always full. But when I'd 
have my parties, I'd have to go to Brian. Well, I had

20:08.080 --> 20:11.125
two or three girls at Brian that I phoned. And they 
filled their cars up full. See, the boys weren't

20:14.525 --> 20:16.488
allowed to go with them. Oh, there'd been such a 
change in that campus. And when the party was over

20:20.074 --> 20:24.200
at 11, 30, or 12-something, they had to be back up to 
college. And Dad and I would have to take those

20:25.061 --> 20:29.508
girls home, you know. Me and I, I never did go to bed. 
But I was having such a good time, and I was young and

20:34.656 --> 20:37.561
gay then. I didn't mind it. I didn't mind it.

20:45.963 --> 20:47.006
But when did they... They used to commute by this 
railroad. Yes, now that was for my day. That was for

20:53.945 --> 20:54.827
my day. The railroad wasn't here. The little 
trolley wasn't here. The tracks had already been

20:57.856 --> 21:00.543
up and everything when we came. See, those are in 
the code, too. No, the boys didn't have, I'll tell

21:03.040 --> 21:06.746
you how they got to Brian. We didn't have a picture 
show or anything out here, and they just

21:06.766 --> 21:11.253
hitchhiked. You'd see 8 and 10 or 12 on the corner, 
and everybody would pick them up, just as many as

21:11.273 --> 21:18.004
they could hang on the car, including me. And now 
they won't even stop for them. They're afraid to.

21:22.111 --> 21:29.082
Well, and then with 20,000, you're bound to get a 
few you don't want. No, they just did their

21:30.192 --> 21:44.654
hitchhiking instead of using that trolley.

21:44.674 --> 21:52.406
But I think one of the biggest changes that's been 
made, I don't know if you want this or not, is in that

21:44.674 --> 21:52.406
campus. See, there wasn't any of those buildings 
there. It was just all... campus, except a few

21:58.340 --> 22:03.992
streets that had those professors' phones on it. 
And the rest of it was just me. I've sat here and

22:06.938 --> 22:10.546
watched it, but I don't believe it. Watched it grow 
and still don't believe it. But now there's every

22:14.535 --> 22:18.964
denomination in the world here at church on every 
corner. But you said when y'all first came here,

22:19.197 --> 22:22.340
there were only two churches? Our church and the 
Presbyterian didn't have a church. They met in the

22:26.685 --> 22:27.466
Y. And so did the Episcopalians. And the Lutherans 
had rooms in the Guyon Hall. But they had their

22:35.514 --> 22:39.399
morning services, and then they worshipped with 
us in the evening. They worshipped with us in the

22:40.740 --> 22:41.921
evening. We had pretty nice evening services. 
Brother, I mean, Major Dunn was a drunk, wasn't he?

22:49.387 --> 22:51.189
had charge of the band then. And he would bring, oh, 
18 or 20 of those band members at our church on

22:51.209 --> 22:56.855
Sunday night. And Mrs. Norton, the coach's wife, 
was our pianist. So we were very much involved with

23:02.101 --> 23:05.044
A&M. And those two people would really draw a 
crowd. And Coach Norton had a daughter that would

23:09.669 --> 23:13.473
draw a crowd anywhere. She'd come with her mother.

23:21.145 --> 23:28.534
Well, were the churches in Bryan pretty well 
established, and the students weren't going to

23:21.145 --> 23:28.534
there? No, they wouldn't. Well, they had no way of 
getting there. You see, in the first place, they

23:31.118 --> 23:34.342
had no way of getting there. And our

23:34.362 --> 23:42.672
church and the, oh yes, the Baptist church was 
here. I didn't mention them. They were here. They

23:44.534 --> 23:45.896
had a little church here. And Brother... Brother 
Brown and Brother Anson and my husband were the

23:48.871 --> 23:53.175
three main pastors. The other churches that I met, 
the Presbyterians and the Episcopalians, they

23:53.595 --> 23:58.860
really didn't have a pastor. They just met and had 
Sunday school in those buildings up there. You

24:04.445 --> 24:06.787
see, just to hold the group together. But now, 
everybody, including the Jews, well, everybody,

24:06.807 --> 24:18.338
the Church of Christ, the Seventh-day 
Adventists, they all have churches now, as you

24:06.807 --> 24:18.338
know. But ours and the Baptist's

24:20.461 --> 24:36.341
were the only two real permanent churches on the 
campus.

24:37.623 --> 24:45.433
You mentioned one thing, how being here affected 
me and what it had done to me. It did a lot. It just did

24:49.317 --> 24:52.526
a lot for me, for those boys. Well, they were the 
sweetest mean boys I ever saw. They were just

25:00.467 --> 25:05.200
sweet, but they'd play every kind of joke on you, on 
Earth. And yet they were just perfect gentlemen.

25:09.365 --> 25:15.836
And you hear now of so much thievery going on and 
stealing and things like that. You never heard of

25:16.196 --> 25:18.620
such a thing then. In fact, one of the boys made his 
way through school by selling homemade candy. I

25:23.843 --> 25:26.406
think his mother gave him a lift at that point. And 
you know what he did? He had a table in one of those

25:27.848 --> 25:36.079
halls up there and would put it out in a box and cover 
it with cellophane paper and everything where it

25:27.848 --> 25:36.079
was sanitary. And with another box, two pieces for 
a nickel. And he said he never lost a dime. Nobody

25:41.966 --> 25:46.112
would take a piece of candy without dropping a 
nickel in that plate. And now here they rest them

25:46.532 --> 25:49.576
every night for students. See, it's a 
different... And when you had boys like that, you

25:51.738 --> 25:57.807
know, they did something for you. I just loved them 
for their, well, for their inward search and their

25:58.288 --> 26:05.119
outward reach and their upward look. They were 
that type of boys. We were sent here to help them,

26:07.122 --> 26:14.854
and they helped us because we wouldn't have 
betrayed their confidence for anything in the

26:07.122 --> 26:14.854
world. And I had the pleasure of having so many of 
their mothers at home on Mother's Day. You know,

26:20.341 --> 26:21.462
and things like that. And when they come down, I 
keep their mothers, a lot of them, in the homes. So

26:25.287 --> 26:27.510
it was a very happy relationship. And that's why we 
decided right then we wanted to stay here the rest

26:27.530 --> 26:31.374
of our lives. Because we thought every one of those 
20,000 agas were going to be just like that 900.

26:39.584 --> 26:40.525
And many of them are. Many of them are. You wouldn't 
expect to find a few in 20,000.

26:46.793 --> 26:46.973
You know. Della and I were talking on our way up. I 
don't know, are you familiar with Mom's, this

26:51.963 --> 26:57.468
boarding house that used to be back on the other 
side? No. I was just wondering, I thought maybe you

26:58.609 --> 27:01.532
might know her. Evidently she'd been here for, you 
know, since the war or something like that,

27:02.333 --> 27:08.418
selling meals, homemade meals. It's on 25th 
Street. That wasn't the Bell, Ms. Farmer, the Bell

27:13.283 --> 27:17.787
home, was it? You know, I'm not familiar with that. 
I'm just curious on that. No, I wish I could give you

27:24.854 --> 27:26.996
some information on that. It's an itty place where 
a lot of Aggies go out there, and the food is really

27:27.016 --> 27:31.340
expensive. It used to be like, for a dollar a plate, 
all you would want. A lot of Aggies went out there.

27:36.085 --> 27:39.509
And we're just trying to figure out how long 
they've been there. Because I didn't know. I know I

27:40.169 --> 27:43.032
had been out there about three years ago, and he had 
been there. Well, I'll tell you. Since my son

27:44.033 --> 27:53.983
graduated from A&M, and my husband was no longer on 
the faculty, I've lost contact with a lot of these

27:44.033 --> 27:53.983
things that have been in vogue, I'd say, since 
then, you see. And I've never, I don't believe I've

27:58.619 --> 28:01.123
ever heard of Moms. There used to be a Mrs. Bell here 
right across the street from the First Methodist

28:01.563 --> 28:08.072
Church that served homemade meals. And boy, the 
boys sure flocked in there. And she served one for a

28:10.916 --> 28:13.800
dollar meal. And she just put it on a big, long 
table. And boy, you just eat until you... Sounds

28:18.230 --> 28:19.652
like moms. It must be similar. But I'm not familiar 
with that. I'm sorry. But since you lost contact

28:26.361 --> 28:33.390
with the college, you're working locally with a 
community now? Yes, I'm still a member of the

28:33.410 --> 28:35.112
church. My husband's pastor of the A&M Methodist 
Church. And he also served as a Wesley Foundation

28:40.078 --> 28:47.528
director and taught religious education in the 
college. He had a big Bible class in the college.

28:51.053 --> 28:53.397
They don't have that anymore. I don't know why that 
would discontinue. But he had a big class, and he

28:55.540 --> 29:00.909
was so proud of them. And they were excellent 
students. And if they deserved an A, he gave it to

29:03.312 --> 29:06.197
them. And they called him in one time. It seemed to 
be a rule that you just give so many A's and flunk the

29:11.656 --> 29:18.427
rest of them to make them, you know how that goes. 
Well, Mr. Jackson said, I just cannot do that. He

29:21.151 --> 29:25.078
said, if they deserve an A, I've just got to give it 
to them. And he said, I'll let you have their

29:25.138 --> 29:29.164
papers, anybody that's familiar with the Bible. 
And if you can't give them, if you see where I've

29:29.625 --> 29:35.875
made a mistake, he said, I'll correct it. You see, 
we had three, now over here at our church, now that

29:36.935 --> 29:54.536
he was pastor for four years, they have three 
ministers

29:36.935 --> 29:54.536
and a Wesley Foundation worker, and they have four 
or five secretaries, paid, all paid. And when we

29:54.896 --> 29:57.179
were here, we had the whole thing by ourselves. But 
we only had 900 boys, whereas they have 20.

30:04.108 --> 30:04.528
I don't know. 20,000. I couldn't say it. 20,000. So 
there's a lot of difference. What about the people

30:11.855 --> 30:17.300
who sort of settled into College Station and Bryan 
since you've been here? Has the main reason been

30:17.360 --> 30:25.729
the school, or are they really just different 
people coming in for the job? Well, I believe a lot

30:25.749 --> 30:28.211
of them. I mean, I won't say a lot of them. I'll crack 
myself there and say a part of them have come on

30:29.913 --> 30:34.617
account of the schools. both A&M and Allen 
Academy. But most of them, I believe, have come

30:37.939 --> 30:49.195
from a commercial standpoint because this is the 
fastest growing area, you know, anywhere. And I

30:49.796 --> 30:55.184
think they've come here from a commercial 
standpoint more than they have the schools. You

30:55.204 --> 31:01.593
hate to think that, you know, but I just will be 
honest with you. I do believe that this is true

31:01.713 --> 31:04.958
because we have so many things that don't even 
pertain to the college that they come in here and

31:06.052 --> 31:23.031
all these pizza huts and hamburgers and things 
like that of course they've come to mcdowell but

31:06.052 --> 31:23.031
now the the we didn't have a motel
