WEBVTT

00:03.119 --> 00:14.254
football games and Yale practice, did you all talk 
about, was there the 12th man, were the traditions

00:03.119 --> 00:14.254
then? Yes. Did anybody kiss their dates after? Oh 
yeah. That was a wonderful thing back then. What

00:24.107 --> 00:29.174
football games do you remember during that era as 
being special games? I don't I remember any one

00:31.267 --> 00:38.236
outstanding one, they were all special, but 
probably the most special ones was when we had an

00:31.267 --> 00:38.236
opportunity to knock Texas off.

00:41.420 --> 00:44.164
And that didn't happen much back then. Who were the 
athletic heroes of your student days? Oh, there

00:47.809 --> 00:49.150
was Bob Smith. I think he came along a little after 
I... I think he was in school when I graduated,

00:54.037 --> 00:57.882
about the time I graduated. There was...

01:04.223 --> 01:34.180
Coaches.

01:35.442 --> 01:39.726
I

01:35.442 --> 01:39.726
don't even know who was coach then.

01:43.309 --> 01:45.010
I think it was Norton. Homer Norton? I think so. It 
could have been. I'm not really sure. I think he's

01:51.236 --> 01:55.019
there at least part of your student days. Let's 
see, Muster. Yeah, we always attended Muster.

02:01.385 --> 02:01.965
Where was that? We had Muster on campus. And I don't 
know how many external musters were going on at

02:06.188 --> 02:14.045
that time, but they began to spread pretty 
rapidly. And I think it was in Guyon Hall. Did the

02:16.210 --> 02:18.736
veterans participate in muster? Yeah, they did. I 
have the impression that World War II made muster

02:25.342 --> 02:27.245
into something, really, really. I think it made it 
to, yeah, I really do. And I think that's where it

02:29.769 --> 02:32.313
really started spreading. Did you, as an 
undergraduate, hear anything about the

02:32.493 --> 02:36.339
Corregidor muster? Oh, yeah.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.570
Let's see, final review, no. Commencement, no. 
Silver taps. Yes, we've stood out in the Marina

02:52.949 --> 03:03.519
there, and then moved to the Corps of the Army area,

02:52.949 --> 03:03.519
and built several taps or something, and really 
got to you. Particularly, he knew the cadet. And

03:06.442 --> 03:11.707
back then, he knew just about every cadet. Did you 
all, on campus, did you all speak to everybody? Oh,

03:14.970 --> 03:18.994
yes.

03:19.014 --> 03:19.355
Yeah, absolutely. And if you didn't know them, you 
wouldn't have whipped out. A bonfire. Bonfire was

03:26.265 --> 03:28.027
different than it is now. Describe it then. I mean 
it wasn't put up engineeringly in the manner it is

03:29.308 --> 03:34.895
now. It was a lot of fun. He did cut trees. He did pick 
up other things to throw in a bonfire too. I mean it

03:40.981 --> 03:49.251
wasn't just any old timbers and things that

03:40.981 --> 03:49.251
you could find. But the significance of it is the 
same. Held where? It was held on for a long time. It

03:55.501 --> 03:57.925
was held on the old red pail. And who gathered the 
materials?

04:02.311 --> 04:04.955
Was there anything on top of the bonfire? Always a 
crapper. And where did that come from? Well,

04:07.959 --> 04:13.007
usually back in them days and times, very frankly, 
we'd steal it.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.855
Did you all have the, were there red pots then? No, 
it wasn't that organized then. And how did you all

04:23.163 --> 04:32.073
get things up on the bonfire?

04:32.093 --> 04:34.855
You know, I really don't remember. Didn't use any 
kind of a gantry crane or anything? No, we didn't

04:37.398 --> 04:39.661
have one. We probably blocked the tackles off. 
Let's see. Let's go back to... to being a fish. Do

04:52.153 --> 04:54.977
you remember any projects you were assigned?

04:57.580 --> 05:00.143
Any tasks that some sophomore gave you?

05:07.411 --> 05:15.040
Describe those.

05:21.078 --> 05:28.045
If you bottled it very much, then that was the case 
for quite some time. You're talking about now

05:28.065 --> 05:30.848
they're homework assignments? Yeah. When it was 
reading, like in English or, you know, literature

05:30.988 --> 05:37.634
and stuff like that. You'd read it to, or any other 
assignments you remember? Projects? I'm trying

05:41.618 --> 05:42.419
to think. Oh, yeah, we'd always have to go get stuff 
for them. You know, things like that. We later

05:48.004 --> 05:49.206
don't have to put. Mail? Did you go pick up their 
mail? Oh, we picked up everything for them, yeah.

05:56.639 --> 06:01.644
The mail, brought them chow to the dorm when they 
wanted, whatever they wanted. Now, could y'all,

06:01.664 --> 06:07.709
you couldn't legally carry food out of the dining 
hall? No. Did y'all ever carry food out of the

06:08.289 --> 06:11.212
dining hall? Yeah. How? Well, there's lots of ways 
to do that, but you can do it pretty well. Describe a

06:18.939 --> 06:21.561
room inspection by Well, when the military wrote 
an inspection, it was with a white glove. And the

06:30.821 --> 06:38.769
officer doing the inspection would test every 
place in the room to see if you had dusted and

06:30.821 --> 06:38.769
cleaned it well. Like over the door seals at the top 
of the doors that come dust there when you just get

06:39.670 --> 06:46.477
at it. Of course, your beds had to be just perfect 
military. Your clothes had to be hung just exactly

06:51.393 --> 06:56.298
right. Your socks and shorts were folded just 
right. It was a very ethereal inspection. Other

07:04.346 --> 07:08.250
assignments that you remember as a fish?

07:12.074 --> 07:15.457
Were you ever expected to do something that you 
thought was wrong? Well, I probably did at the

07:16.638 --> 07:18.160
time. But you don't remember? But I don't 
remember. And as I look back, I wouldn't take

07:20.709 --> 07:27.337
anything for a freshman year in the hazing. I think 
it ingrained something into a person. I know they

07:33.084 --> 07:38.270
frown on it now, but it didn't hurt me, and I don't 
think it hurt anybody.

07:41.193 --> 07:42.915
Let's see, we were talking about the students a 
while ago. Were there any students of Asian

07:42.935 --> 07:46.459
ancestry that you recall? They weren't in my 
outfit or any of the neighboring outfits in our

07:48.380 --> 07:56.493
dorm, but that's not to say they wasn't. Hispanic? 
They were some Hispanics, yes. Did y'all have,

07:58.997 --> 08:01.301
were they treated any differently? No. Did fellow 
Aggies have nicknames? Yeah. What were some of

08:10.416 --> 08:10.977
them? Oh, you know, I mean all kinds of nicknames. I 
can't remember them offhand, but Slim or Domino or

08:15.802 --> 08:25.694
Rabbit. It's a lot of things to know to kind of 
signify characteristics of the individual. Did

08:31.721 --> 08:32.682
you have a nickname? I may have, but I didn't know 
it. Aggie Ring. Yep. Do you remember what it cost?

08:42.633 --> 08:45.416
Seemed to me like my Aggie ring was about $35. Who 
paid for it? My dad paid for it. And was there

08:51.742 --> 08:58.069
anything that happened in your heart or feelings 
when you started wearing that Aggie ring? You bet.

08:59.450 --> 09:05.036
I mean, that was one of the prouder days of my 
college career. And I still have that same ring

09:05.056 --> 09:09.180
today, although it's just about totally wore out. 
I ordered the new ring about six, seven years ago. I

09:12.829 --> 09:15.913
couldn't make myself take this one off. Why? I had 
just so much sentimentality attached to it, I

09:16.914 --> 09:19.618
guess. What does an Aggie ring mean to you? Well, 
you know, there's an old saying, what do you call an

09:23.583 --> 09:27.948
Aggie five years after graduation? Boss. If you 
look around the world, and any place you go, You

09:34.135 --> 09:42.722
identify Aggies by their rings, and usually 
they're in places that are responsible to your

09:34.135 --> 09:42.722
leadership. Share with this machine two or three 
examples of where an Aggie ring has meant

09:42.742 --> 09:53.812
something in your experience.

09:56.034 --> 10:02.079
I guess I probably have met more Aggies on 
airplanes than anything else that I didn't know.

10:02.099 --> 10:04.041
And I have met them in other parts of the world. But 
it seemed like those acquaintances you make on the

10:04.443 --> 10:11.671
planes always turned to be beneficial. But I 
picked up several clients in my consulting

10:11.691 --> 10:20.740
business by having them in Aggie on the plane.

10:21.181 --> 10:25.986
What is Aggie spirit?

10:26.006 --> 10:30.130
It reminds me of a story that The kid thought that 
everybody was an Aggie because the dad was. And he

10:37.306 --> 10:46.294
saw a guy with a different type of class ring and it 
bothered him and he asked his dad and said, dad is

10:37.306 --> 10:46.294
that guy an Aggie? And the guy replied, son, if he's 
an Aggie he'll tell you proudly. If he's not, don't

10:52.319 --> 10:55.823
be embarrassed.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.707
Aggie spirit is just something that's indwelled 
in you It don't take long to get it when you're on

11:01.818 --> 11:04.041
that campus. I've had a lot of people who, since 
I've, over the years, have told me that they went to

11:05.082 --> 11:12.731
A&M, didn't think they were going to stay. And 
within six weeks, you couldn't get them away. It's

11:18.818 --> 11:22.062
just that thing that binds them together, binds 
Aggies together. Where did that Aggie spirit,

11:22.423 --> 11:26.588
where or when did it start with you? I guess the 
first week I was on campus. I was already sold on

11:31.433 --> 11:32.974
Aggies. Did you ever think about leaving? No. I was 
just worried about getting kicked out.

11:44.244 --> 11:45.145
Let's see.

11:50.669 --> 11:56.134
Well, what are the qualities of an Aggie? The key 
ingredients. I think they're gentlemanly,

11:58.175 --> 12:01.238
scholarly, I

12:01.977 --> 12:17.437
guess

12:01.977 --> 12:17.437
just about every good adjective you can think of 
tells you what an Aggie

12:01.977 --> 12:17.437
is. All right, the most important question of the 
whole thing. We've got two of those. What did it

12:23.184 --> 12:24.586
mean to you? What has it meant to your life that you 
went to that institution? Success. uh not to

12:31.863 --> 13:01.718
saying that i wouldn't have had success otherwise 
but it put an assurity in me that i knew i had it to do

12:31.863 --> 13:01.718
if i just get out and do it and give you that 
self-confidence to make the moves that you need to

12:31.863 --> 13:01.718
make it's just something that when you leave there 
you know you've got something nobody else has

12:31.863 --> 13:01.718
although they may have a college education you've 
got something that's even greater than a college

13:02.137 --> 13:04.642
education. You've got that unity of all your 
students that you go to school with, and any other

13:04.662 --> 13:20.290
Aggie you meet, regardless of the classroom, 
they're going to be willing to help and assist you

13:04.662 --> 13:20.290
and aid you

13:04.662 --> 13:20.290
in anything. What feelings do you have in your 
heart for A&M now?

13:29.879 --> 13:35.651
I guess my big regret is I'm not rich, so I can give a 
lot of money daily. I've given a lot of time and

13:35.671 --> 13:41.303
service daily, and I've enjoyed every bit of it. I 
would do anything they asked me to do. And if I ever

13:45.011 --> 13:47.837
hit that jackpot, they're going to get the most out 
of it.
