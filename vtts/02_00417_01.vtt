WEBVTT

00:01.516 --> 00:03.077
A lot of people, big men already. As a man asked him, 
about 65 or 70 years old, the other one was like 45

00:03.278 --> 00:10.204
years old. They were standing next to a post of the 
telephone. And the big man said to the other one, he

00:17.150 --> 00:23.256
said, hey, this wire is hole, how do you speak for 
him? Then the other one said to him, but how are you

00:25.618 --> 00:28.741
so dumb like that? Don't you see that the voice runs 
through the electricity? He said, well, I thought

00:32.347 --> 00:36.252
the wire was hollowed out. Well, there's the 
ignorance.

00:40.978 --> 00:43.060
It's like I say, people didn't know how to read. 
Many took a piece of paper and looked at it, but they

00:43.220 --> 00:47.005
didn't know anything. That's all that happened. I 
also came to work, I earned 15 cents. Taking care of

00:55.215 --> 00:56.236
some... They had like a dairy here. The becerros, 
you know what they are? Beceros. Beceros, sí.

01:02.580 --> 01:09.130
Bueno, cuidaba yo los beceros acá, vacina a las 
pastas, a cuidarlos allá, y la tarde los traigo

01:02.580 --> 01:09.130
allí. Y eso ganaba 15 centavos por día, nada más. 
Pero en ese tiempo estaba todo muy barato también.

01:17.141 --> 01:17.962
Sí. Mucho, muy barato todo. And now, people get 
sick. A lot of people died because there were no

01:22.818 --> 01:24.941
doctors. Yes. In those days, Mexico was very far 
behind. That's why. And in which town do you live in

01:31.490 --> 01:35.116
Mexico? In which town? What's your town called? I 
used to live in a very big farm that the Spaniards

01:39.181 --> 01:43.668
had. Many years ago, when Spain ruled Mexico for a 
long time. It was called... La hacienda esa se

01:49.769 --> 01:51.531
llamaba Piautillos. El estado de San Luis. De San 
Luis corría la línea de San Luis a Tampico. Y sobre

01:58.838 --> 02:00.440
la línea esa estaba ese lugar. Y allí es donde mi 
papá allí, pues allí se crió, yo creo. Y allí nací

02:06.586 --> 02:07.447
yo. Y me crié hasta de 12 años. Me vine para acá, para 
la frontera. Y así estuvimos acá. Pero, pues la

02:13.533 --> 02:18.739
gente muy pobrecita, ¿sabes? No... Well, there 
was nowhere to earn money. There was nowhere to

02:21.330 --> 02:22.091
work. People didn't get paid for their work. They 
didn't get a good salary or anything. That's why.

02:27.417 --> 02:33.525
And as I say, people were missing from school so 
they knew something. So they could read

02:33.605 --> 02:37.610
newspapers and find out about other places, how 
things were. But without knowing anything, they

02:37.630 --> 02:40.533
couldn't know anything. And what year did your 
family come here to the border? No. In what year? In

02:47.620 --> 02:54.288
1912.

02:55.229 --> 03:05.600
When they

02:55.229 --> 03:05.600
killed Madero, it was in 1913. It was when they 
killed Madero and the generals of Porfirio Díaz.

03:11.107 --> 03:18.954
between

03:11.107 --> 03:18.954
Piedras Negras and Viacuña, between Egle Paz and 
the river. Yes. That's where we were. Then he came

03:24.158 --> 03:40.692
to take a Mexican commission here to the state of 
Texas, because a rich man from Monterrey had land

03:24.158 --> 03:40.692
in that place, and a part of land from the 
government too, and he took people from here, to

03:41.465 --> 03:47.053
plant there if they had their mules, their tools. 
He took everything. It didn't cost him anything,

03:48.595 --> 03:51.339
just the passage and the family. And everyone went 
to plant there, to that place. But in the

03:55.345 --> 04:10.586
revolution that was in Mexico, the people said 
that the federals, the people of the federation,

03:55.345 --> 04:10.586
the government that has been doing to the people 
this and that, well, many came and left, just like

03:55.345 --> 04:10.586
those who leave for the people. They left 
everything. And they didn't do anything to him. We

04:14.623 --> 04:16.885
were there, they didn't do anything to anyone. 
Yes, they kicked us out because they said that...

04:16.905 --> 04:24.513
Because a son, the man who took that place was 
called Lorenzo González Treviño. And he had a son

04:26.515 --> 04:29.718
too. And he raised people in favor of Carranza. 
Yes, Carranza. He was the one who fought against

04:35.583 --> 04:39.467
Victoriano Huerta. And when the Federals got 
there, they said that even the Peruvians had to

04:40.882 --> 04:46.151
kill and burn everything. But they didn't do 
anything. Because at that time, the Federals were

04:49.276 --> 04:53.583
in Torreón. And Francisco Villa attacked Torreón 
and beat them. And they only knew that they were

04:57.971 --> 05:04.121
here in Piedras Negras and they ran to the 
mountains. And they left everything. They didn't

05:04.922 --> 05:05.944
do anything. And that year, there were some very 
big harvests that happened, like no other year.

05:14.701 --> 05:22.027
Well, but whatever it was, Mexico was very tough 
because, as here, God doesn't want there to be a war

05:14.701 --> 05:22.027
here. Because if here in Brine there is a general 
with so many people, another Houston general

05:23.408 --> 05:35.779
comes to attack this one with twice as many people, 
this one doesn't wait for him, because he says, I

05:23.408 --> 05:35.779
won't resist. They left here, and that's what they 
did there. The warehouses that they had, they lit

05:40.046 --> 05:42.951
fire to them. The people, what were they going to do 
afterwards? They were fine there, the government

05:47.119 --> 05:53.210
gave them food for the soldiers and the people. But 
the people? They got very tough there. That's why I

05:57.097 --> 06:00.383
say, I hope they don't do that here. Because there 
were times when people didn't have anything to

06:01.392 --> 06:05.476
eat. That's the truth. It's a very hard war, 
wherever it is. That's why I say that I hope that

06:09.219 --> 06:17.307
this never comes here, because many of us are going 
to die of hunger here if we live. But I hope not.

06:19.569 --> 06:23.973
That's how it happened in Mexico, and that's why I 
came here too. I went to this side, looking for

06:24.053 --> 06:30.960
life, the truth, looking to work to live. That's 
why I came, because it was already very hard, they

06:31.953 --> 06:51.857
couldn't invest anything, because after the 
parties that there were, Carranza and Huerta,

06:31.953 --> 06:51.857
then many got up and then many were not fighting, 
but stealing from the rich. They became animals

06:51.877 --> 06:53.739
and everything. I'm not talking about that I live 
in Carranza, Huerta and no. That's why we came

07:01.030 --> 07:02.332
here. Do you want to listen to it? It's being 
recorded, right? Yes. It's being recorded. Your

07:16.110 --> 07:17.952
book is very good. I write it, you listen to it, and 
then you write it. I've never been to Mexico. I

07:26.142 --> 07:27.424
haven't been to Mexico. Yes, I know Mexico very 
well. I don't know much about Mexico, the center of

07:32.639 --> 07:42.474
Mexico, the city of Mexico, because, as I say, my 
parents were very poor. They barely worked to

07:42.494 --> 07:44.578
live. They spent a lot of money to go there. They 
spent a lot of money to go there. But now... Now

07:50.725 --> 07:52.888
there are many. Mexico is very beautiful. What 
people want in Mexico is to be very kind to

07:58.236 --> 08:05.728
everyone. There is no discrimination. Everyone

08:09.113 --> 08:12.978
is the same. How many years did you have when you 
came to the United States? Well, all of that comes

08:19.008 --> 08:25.936
from the beginning of the world, according to what 
I have read. From the beginning of the world comes

08:25.956 --> 08:33.085
all of that that many did not want to know

08:25.956 --> 08:33.085
each other. And so,

08:33.165 --> 08:38.592
well, everything goes on. But now, in the present, 
everything is peaceful, everyone is living very

08:40.193 --> 08:45.640
well. Yes, but not in these years. In those years, 
no. In the war, no. And ma'am, where in Mexico are

08:56.676 --> 09:00.901
you from? I'm from Nuevo León. Nuevo León? In the 
Villa de Santiago. Villa de Santiago. And what

09:09.470 --> 09:13.635
year did you come to the United States? Well, on the 
19th we moved here because me and him moved to

09:13.733 --> 09:19.404
Mexico. Oh, to Mexico. And what town did you find? 
Well, right there. The town we found was here in

09:31.548 --> 09:33.953
Black Rocks. When

09:34.692 --> 09:39.259
they passed us. In which town? In Piedras Negras. 
In Piedras Negras, perhaps. Before that, they

09:43.325 --> 09:47.491
called it Porfirio Díaz City. Before that? Yes, 
many years ago. Ah, in what year? That's what they

09:52.058 --> 09:53.901
called it. Because we came from Monterrey by train 
to that place. And they asked us, people on the

10:00.170 --> 10:03.535
train, where are you going? My mother would say, 
let's go to Piedras Negras. And they would say, oh,

10:07.999 --> 10:13.265
you're going to help Porfirio Díaz. That's how

10:13.325 --> 10:19.772
they called him. But in that time that we came, it 
was already in peace, but it was barely, as they say

10:19.792 --> 10:29.462
in Mexico, starting to lift everything up. 
Because of the revolution, everything was

10:29.482 --> 10:32.485
destroyed. Everything. It was a very tough

10:33.957 --> 10:39.222
war. Because, as I tell you, they would go, they 
would burn there. They would remove a rail from the

10:44.488 --> 10:47.351
line on this side and another on this side. Then 
with a chain, they would tie the end of the rail of

10:48.171 --> 10:55.239
this and this other and they would turn on the 
machine's chain and go, look, there is the line.

10:57.281 --> 11:02.206
They would get to a bridge, they would put dynamite 
on the other side so that it would not serve the

10:57.281 --> 11:02.206
others who came. That's why they did that. It's a 
destruction of everything.

11:09.048 --> 11:11.091
That's what I say, it's very hard. Now, it 
fascinates you, just like the wars that have

11:13.213 --> 11:17.778
happened here in other places. They destroy

11:18.399 --> 11:29.291
everything. Well, I can't do it anymore. First, 
please tell me

11:33.138 --> 11:40.668
your name. What's your name? Right now, I don't 
have many things in mind. No, tell him your name. My

11:50.502 --> 11:50.963
name? Yes. Margarito Sustaita. And your town in 
Mexico was... The town where you were born? Yes. I

12:03.485 --> 12:10.055
was born in a hacienda in Mexico. And what is the 
name of the hacienda? It's called Peotillos. In

12:14.883 --> 12:16.125
what state was it? San Luis Potosí. And close to the 
town, which town? Close to... The closest was...

12:26.395 --> 12:29.580
It used to be Villa Iturbide, now it's Villa 
Hidalgo. I'm registered and baptized there. It's

12:34.127 --> 12:40.758
like... and here at the school is the place. And 
what year were you born? In 1898. In 1898. And what

12:45.826 --> 12:51.154
year did you come to the United States? 1919, in 
November. I went this way. And what year did you

12:59.152 --> 13:08.426
leave

12:59.152 --> 13:08.426
your farm for the first time? Where was I the first 
time I went? Yes. When I went this way,

13:11.871 --> 13:19.021
I was in B. Wells planting onions. From there I came 
to Viure. I was sowing in agriculture. In 1920 and

13:29.263 --> 13:32.967
in 1921. From there I moved to another town called 
Yula. It's on the way to San Marcos. I was sowing

13:44.957 --> 13:48.300
there with a man in a ranch. His name was Agustín 
Gargoyle. I've been here for 22, 23, and 24 years. I

13:59.386 --> 14:01.107
came here in 1924. I came here in November, and I've 
been living here ever since. In Guam. I came here to

14:07.834 --> 14:12.619
the Boran to plant, for agriculture. Here in Guam 
too? In the Boran, yes. I spent 14 years in the

14:15.743 --> 14:19.967
Boran, and I came here three times. On the 27th, I 
moved to Alboran to sow with our Yende.

14:28.421 --> 14:36.629
And on the 41st, I left to sow with the last one, and 
then I moved to

14:28.421 --> 14:36.629
Alboran. Well, what was your father's name? My 
father? Yes. My father's name was Rosalío

14:41.894 --> 14:46.218
Sustaita. And your mother? Ventura Navarro. And 
did they live all their lives there in the farm? No.

14:56.739 --> 14:59.343
One year or two they were in that farm. Then, 
because they had relatives in Monterrey, my

14:59.363 --> 15:10.640
father came and my grandmother was there on his 
side. My grandmother had been dead for years. When

15:13.103 --> 15:16.508
we came to Monterrey, we were there for a year or 
two. We came back to the farm. Y la última vez ya

15:19.111 --> 15:26.601
cuando él se vino para acá, para Texas, a las Piscas 
de Algodón. Y como los parientes que estaban ahí en

15:28.063 --> 15:40.500
Monterrey, ahí estaban y él se enfermó aquí y se fue 
para Monterrey y de ahí nos mandó a traer de allá a

15:28.063 --> 15:40.500
Monterrey. Y de ahí los parientes se vinieron aquí 
a la orilla del río, cerca de Viacuña. ¿En qué año?

15:49.452 --> 15:51.214
In 1911, they arrived there. And my father went 
there that year. And in 1912, he sent us from there

15:57.603 --> 16:05.393
to that place there. And there we were, when the 
revolution in Mexico was 13, we were already

16:05.453 --> 16:12.442
there. And from there, I spent seven years in that 
place, and from there I came here. in 1919, because

16:18.359 --> 16:21.502
the revolution left everything. Life was very 
hard there. And we came in search of work to make a

16:24.465 --> 16:30.872
living. And here, as there was no agriculture in 
that place, I had to sow in agriculture too. And

16:35.657 --> 16:40.523
that's it.

16:41.724 --> 16:47.590
And then I left, I stopped sowing, I got a job in the 
dining room at the school. I worked there for 20

16:48.565 --> 16:50.027
years. And

16:50.307 --> 16:57.675
then they kicked me out because of my age. And I've 
always worked without a job, because I don't go to

16:57.735 --> 17:03.721
work because of my age. I'm going to work. How old 
are you? You're 75 years old now. No, I'm not 75. You

17:10.989 --> 17:13.751
don't have to know. To work, you have to work in the 
work you do outside. that I can do. And that is what

17:19.704 --> 17:27.074
is happening right now in the world. I am receiving 
social security, which is what is helping me. When

17:33.122 --> 17:41.494
you were young in Mexico,

17:33.122 --> 17:41.494
what kind of things did you do? For example, was 
there work for the children? No, very good. He

17:51.913 --> 17:55.676
says, what were you doing there? Were you working 
for the children or what? Oh, there in the farm, as I

18:01.502 --> 18:06.147
told you the other time, I was taking care of some 
beceros. Do you know what a becero is? Yes. It had a

18:08.029 --> 18:11.772
dairy, as they call it here. Yes. Very big. You had 
to bring up to 50 beceros. And that's the work I did

18:15.236 --> 18:16.437
there. I would take them to the pasture, I would 
take care of them. In the afternoon, I would take

18:21.035 --> 18:24.320
them to the corral. I would give them pasture and I 
would take care of them. And that's where I would

18:28.645 --> 18:29.927
work. For how many years did you live in this farm? 
In this farm? Yes. I tell you that sometimes we were

18:33.832 --> 18:39.178
there, sometimes we were in Monterrey. Yes. But 
I...

18:44.783 --> 18:52.435
In that farm I went to school, but very few, not 
many. When I learned to read and write, little to

18:52.455 --> 18:57.983
tell. Because here with my children, my children 
that I was sowing, when the fishing came, they told

18:59.586 --> 19:11.304
me that I was going to weigh the cotton to all those 
who were fishing there. That's what he gave me. I

19:13.741 --> 19:28.482
gave him, on Saturday, a sheet of paper with all the 
names of those who were peeping, how many pounds

19:13.741 --> 19:28.482
each one had and how much money it was. He just paid 
for everything. And if someone asked him, well,

19:31.306 --> 19:36.533
you have so many pounds, how are you? And if someone 
said, well, no, you're wrong. I already told him,

19:41.901 --> 19:43.343
well, it's settled with me. They fixed the level 
and his account was in the wrong. As I said, I don't

19:49.309 --> 19:51.511
take anything from anyone. I take everything from 
everyone. At night I had a lot of work to get

19:56.657 --> 19:58.900
everyone's account. Because I had up to 150 hands. 
And I had to get everyone's account every day. At

20:05.868 --> 20:10.293
night I had to get everyone's account. And how much 
money each person earned. That

20:15.065 --> 20:20.551
was my job here. Yes. Well, this is where I 
exercised more the... the... the numbering. In

20:25.776 --> 20:28.599
that. Because over there, no... In that time in 
Mexico it was very... well... as I thought hours

20:31.702 --> 20:39.330
later that I was here. From the people over there. 
Very good lands. With the water that would fall,

20:43.651 --> 20:47.915
they would raise crops. Because the land wouldn't 
break down. They would store it. What would be sown

20:52.920 --> 20:57.083
with that water would be used for farming. Because 
they would go there very often. But there was no

21:01.367 --> 21:07.313
one... No one to open the agriculture. As I said, 
people were very ignorant, they didn't know

21:08.314 --> 21:12.898
anything. The owners of those places, no. But what 
was the name of the owner of the farm? The owner of

21:22.189 --> 21:24.792
the farm? Yes. His name was... His name was 
Morieles. Yes. His name was Ignacio Morieles, the

21:31.259 --> 21:33.882
owner of the farm. He had children. But his name was 
Ignacio Morieles. He had a house... It was almost a

21:42.038 --> 21:45.424
block away. It was just a house. It was a house, as 
they called it there. Who knows if you've read or

21:51.975 --> 21:55.020
heard of it. It was a house

21:55.040 --> 21:59.969
of a count. It had a house. It had two floors. Below, 
it was just a cellar. Outside, around. And inside,

22:08.617 --> 22:13.061
There were rooms like this, like this, and like 
this, and like this. And in the middle, they were

22:13.081 --> 22:20.308
just gardens that were made with a fountain of 
water in the middle. And inside that farm, there

22:20.328 --> 22:26.033
were many men who worked. There was the bakery, 
there was the market. For me, the farm. And I had the

22:32.739 --> 22:36.362
work they had there. People who occupied, men and 
women, to do the work there in the farmhouse.

22:41.590 --> 22:47.518
Because there was one who was there, who was named 
there, administrator. He was in charge, the

22:48.059 --> 22:50.843
owners were in San Luis. But he was in charge there 
of everything. The owners live in San Luis, in the

22:56.932 --> 22:59.917
city. And another man is in charge of the 
farmhouse. It's like here, a man has a ranch. Well,

23:08.793 --> 23:12.798
if he doesn't want to live here, he has a man to take 
care of the ranch. That's how it was there. The

23:16.823 --> 23:27.076
house, here to the front, was long, it had many 
rooms and portals.

23:27.096 --> 23:30.120
And wide, almost like from here to the street, wide 
the portal. And the rooms were here to the inside.

23:34.105 --> 23:41.894
And from there, from the portal to the outside, it 
was from the ground below, it was like San

23:34.105 --> 23:41.894
Otrocina. Filled with land in pure gardens. That 
they had there of flowers, plants and everything.

23:49.522 --> 23:50.283
Very beautiful. And on this side where the house of 
the hacienda ended, the pader was pure stone. Mix,

23:57.811 --> 23:59.873
so thick, the pader. And there was a large gate and 
it had an arch on the door of the hacienda. And on the

24:04.885 --> 24:11.191
inside, they had, at that time there were no cars, 
they had bogies. And they had horses to light the

24:11.971 --> 24:18.637
bogies when the one in charge of the farm wanted to 
go out for a walk with the family. And they had a very

24:20.239 --> 24:24.523
big square, almost a block of barns, big. And from 
the ones that went into the room over there, from

24:24.663 --> 24:32.149
there to the barn, there were like five 
warehouses. Big, long. They were like... What do

24:33.725 --> 24:39.955
they have in their mouths? They were big. They were 
stuck together. And in that store they had a lot

24:42.940 --> 24:45.544
of... No, they don't have anything. Maybe you 
don't know it or haven't seen it. They call it

24:50.672 --> 24:52.034
lechubilla. That's where they get the lister to 
make the roux. Yes. That's where they get it. and

24:59.257 --> 25:00.659
palm trees. Do you know what a palm tree is? Well, 
that palm tree, the branch is so tall, the branch is

25:02.901 --> 25:07.106
long, the palm tree is very thin. And there they 
make clothes too. Well, that's what produced a lot

25:09.730 --> 25:14.075
of that place. And from there, that's the work they 
had in those warehouses. And they made, well, some

25:20.703 --> 25:25.028
big, so tall, round, so tall. And they would board 
to San Luis where they would ask for train vans full

25:25.683 --> 25:35.978
of... And they would board to San Luis where they 
would ask for them. And from there, the church that

25:35.998 --> 25:43.930
was there would continue. The church was very big, 
full of stone, full of concrete. And the farm. And

25:50.520 --> 25:54.205
over there, there were the rooms of those who 
worked there, The secretaries and everything.

25:58.394 --> 26:02.601
And then there was the school for women and the 
school for men. That's where I went to school. For

26:04.143 --> 26:06.326
all the children in the hacienda? They were like 
this, they came to Callasina. Well, they made a

26:11.253 --> 26:14.518
corner here. They were in this and here, and we were 
in this and here. And then there was a very big

26:19.566 --> 26:24.613
warehouse, very big, that had a lot of things in 
there.

26:27.766 --> 26:31.452
And I only came to study, I started number three. 
Yes. But when it was like, I don't know here, they

26:32.714 --> 26:48.558
went as inspectors, who are going to see how high 
one is in reading. There were books that I had to

26:50.020 --> 26:53.385
study. And the teacher would take the book, and I 
would tell him everything. I would give it to him.

27:03.244 --> 27:04.786
And the reading books, to read. And then the 
arithmetic, the numbers, to do the math and all

27:04.806 --> 27:11.697
that. And that year, of all those who were there, I 
did all the things that the Lord told me to do. And

27:20.891 --> 27:22.634
they said it was enough. But it wasn't enough 
because it was a school like in a city that studies a

27:23.735 --> 27:27.861
lot. Like my children, they studied in the ranch 
there. It's not that the ranch is not the same here

27:31.727 --> 27:37.255
in the town. It's very different because here they 
learn more. And that's why they learned, but it

27:41.442 --> 27:44.005
wasn't enough. And that's what happened. And what 
kind of work did your father have in this farm?

27:50.754 --> 27:55.360
Well, for his work, it was... That same farm had 
chickens. And since it was very big, I think, who

27:55.440 --> 28:02.990
knows if it would reach more than just the land it 
had. Chickens? Yes, from that farm. It's like

28:06.164 --> 28:10.728
wagons, you know? Oh, yes. It's like wagons. It's 
like wagons. It's like wagons. It's like wagons.

28:25.323 --> 28:32.029
It's like wagons.

28:32.109 --> 28:36.053
It's like wagons. Some earned money from other 
farms that were here, and others earned money from

28:36.623 --> 28:43.050
other farms that were here. And they brought the 
same thing to make the rice. That's what they

28:48.156 --> 28:50.879
brought. They brought goods for the people from 
there. And from here they came in loaded with this,

28:54.022 --> 28:58.768
which they call istle. Yes. From here is what they 
brought. That's why the warehouses they had there

29:00.049 --> 29:02.732
were full of that material. When they sent an 
order, a big order, they had two tramways

29:03.252 --> 29:10.804
stretched out by mules. Because the depot of the 
train that passed, I think it was like Vieja del

29:11.606 --> 29:18.898
Colegio. They had two tramways, platforms, and 
they loaded everything with the mules stretched

29:20.040 --> 29:26.290
out for them. And the people would carry them on the 
train. And they would come back empty-handed to

29:30.169 --> 29:34.074
take more, until they filled it all up. And that was 
the work they had to do. And your mother, did she

29:36.456 --> 29:41.282
have a job too? No, she didn't work in that place. 
No, she didn't get to work. She did work here on the

29:46.728 --> 29:53.156
outside, like any other sewing that they could do. 
What kind of house did your family have in the farm?

29:57.168 --> 29:58.750
What kind of houses? Yes, for their families. Do 
you know that this farm was formed with a village?

30:07.324 --> 30:07.684
Yes. And it was big, with many houses. Everyone 
had, like here, like here I am, I have here my yard

30:10.929 --> 30:16.778
and everything. Here they had those houses. But no 
one paid a penny. No? No. They didn't pay rent, they

30:21.305 --> 30:24.390
didn't pay taxation, they didn't pay anything. 
They were living there. All the people. That's

30:28.904 --> 30:31.488
what they had. And they had a right side and a left 
side. And then they crossed the street. In the form

30:35.434 --> 30:36.616
of a town. What kind of material was there? There 
were houses that were made there. And here I have

30:41.183 --> 30:46.291
seen two houses that are called adobe. Yes. Well, 
that's how the houses were made. Yes. There,

30:49.977 --> 30:51.319
adobe. It's not that... The Adobo is so wide. In the 
Revolution, the Adobo's bullets didn't go

30:54.803 --> 30:59.186
through.

31:02.469 --> 31:05.512
Because it's so wide, that's how you can see it. And 
so long, that's how you can see it. There's a lot of

31:09.315 --> 31:12.818
defense for the people there. Well, what kind of 
things happened in this area during the first

31:13.019 --> 31:18.083
years of the Revolution? The first years? Yes. In 
1910, 1911, 1912, what kind of things happened in

31:22.268 --> 31:29.438
the hacienda? Soldiers or other problems? I

31:32.542 --> 31:40.973
didn't understand

31:32.542 --> 31:40.973
the people very well. What kind of work did they do? 
Or what things did they do? Well, tell me about the

31:49.960 --> 31:57.874
life in the farm during the first years of the 
revolution.

31:59.096 --> 32:01.159
Tell me about these things. The people, the farm 
had a lot of land. Yes. Now, outside the houses, it

32:05.427 --> 32:10.956
was already called here, pastas. He had a lot of 
maguey. Do you know maguey? Yes. I have here three

32:15.641 --> 32:18.825
very big ones. Well, the maguey, the people went to 
the pastas and it was almost even. It was maguey and

32:26.493 --> 32:30.037
nopal. In Mexico tuna is given a lot. Cardona. That 
tuna is... They do a lot of things with it. Yes. And

32:40.247 --> 32:42.630
there are tuna cheeses that they call it. There's 
honey that they call tuna. Others call it, it's a

32:47.508 --> 32:50.973
little thicker, they give it another name. And 
from the tuna seeds, they fatten the browns. They

32:55.700 --> 32:59.425
fatten the browns with the tuna seeds. And a lot of 
people were going to be named there to break a

32:59.525 --> 33:06.435
maguey. That's to get water and honey from the 
maguey. Maguey water is very healthy, very

33:10.893 --> 33:15.799
healthy, better than coffee. Well, people would 
go in the morning, they would bring the honey, big

33:17.001 --> 33:28.315
buckets or whatever they could, and they would 
bring it home. In the morning and in the afternoon.

33:33.442 --> 33:35.905
And where they made holes in the maguey like this, 
Everything that was down there, from the head of

33:36.121 --> 33:41.888
the maguey up there, gave the honey. Well, they put 
a stone in the cover, in the hole, so that the

33:42.950 --> 34:03.075
coyotes or other animals, and if the coyote tried 
to remove the stone, they would put it, there's a

33:42.950 --> 34:03.075
lot, a kind of thorn that they call it there, 
coconoste, it's very thorny. Yes. That's the

34:03.796 --> 34:07.180
cane, it's thin, but it has a lot of thorns. It's 
thin, but it has a lot of thorns, very big thorns.

34:10.084 --> 34:15.291
And that's what they put on it so that the coyote 
doesn't get hurt. And in the month of June, you saw

34:15.351 --> 34:21.338
the paste that looked like a stick. It was the 
kiyote that they made. Yes. You see that many

34:26.044 --> 34:32.132
people went to the paste, cut the kiyote, with a lot 
of dry straw, dry marguerite, and I made a fire and I

34:32.669 --> 34:40.738
put it in the fire. I took it to the house, I made a 
well in the ground, I threw a lot of firewood, I

34:40.758 --> 34:56.455
threw stones down, and then I had a lot of firewood 
down, I put the firewood inside and then I covered

34:40.758 --> 34:56.455
it up and I threw firewood. The next day it was well 
cooked and very sweet. Well, that farm had a lot of

35:02.318 --> 35:07.164
Many things had a tree that they called 
garambullo.

35:10.568 --> 35:12.210
That one throws the fruit like the grape. At the end 
of May it is blooming, you can only see the white

35:14.393 --> 35:22.263
flowers. And by the end of June

35:22.283 --> 35:28.550
it is already ripe. That is the garambullo. And in 
the month of August, the nopalera, that you can

35:30.550 --> 35:38.638
only see it colored, all that is pure tuna. And 
people grab a piece like that and make it, because

35:39.559 --> 35:48.288
the store sells them. It's not very expensive, 
right? It's not very expensive. And everyone

35:53.553 --> 35:59.899
grabs a piece like that and goes to cut the tuna with 
a, they make a A piece of board or any piece of stick.

36:05.714 --> 36:10.561
They put a knife on top of it. You see that the crown 
of the tuna, the fin of the tuna, they give it like

36:10.581 --> 36:19.475
this, just that everything is not cut. And then 
with the same knife they cut it down. And there are

36:23.521 --> 36:25.785
people who are working. They named it there, 
peeling the tuna and taking out the pure tuna and

36:27.689 --> 36:33.315
putting it in baskets. And they take it to work. 
That's the work that exists. It's that in the month

36:39.703 --> 36:42.826
of August there's a lot of that there. A lot. And the 
hacienda there had a garden, like that, of the

36:44.148 --> 36:51.856
house of the hacienda, like that, a garden. Here 
they had everything. Trees, fruits and iron. They

36:56.343 --> 36:58.406
had vegetables and everything. That was to 
support

36:58.446 --> 37:03.692
the house and the farm. It was very peaceful. 
People were used to it. They were used to it. Like

37:06.716 --> 37:09.759
here, we are used to living like this. People were 
the same. Living well. But no one paid anything.

37:14.906 --> 37:18.891
No, they didn't pay anything. What did they pay? 
Income? Transactions? No. They all had their own

37:22.815 --> 37:24.898
places. Many had a store to sell something. Some 
made shoes. Others were sastres. Do you know what

37:34.606 --> 37:37.069
sastres are? Women were also sastres. Some were 
fashionistas, dressed like the people of

37:39.511 --> 37:43.694
Margenza. They tried to make a living. That was 
what they did. But the work was the same. Many who

37:53.602 --> 37:56.725
didn't work in the hacienda They sowed, there were 
places where the soil was clean. There they sowed

38:04.231 --> 38:05.593
everything. Because there, in that place, it's 
not very hot, nor is it very cold. It's just like

38:13.904 --> 38:16.588
that. What height was it? What height? At what 
height? Well, it's not very cold and it's not very

38:24.370 --> 38:27.876
hot. It's in the mountains, right? Because here 
it's very hot. Yes. And it's very cold. Yes. Well, I

38:35.047 --> 38:40.456
didn't know the snow that they said, like here. 
Yes. There, I heard that they said... It snowed in

38:42.301 --> 38:45.966
the mountains, but I never saw it there. Not even 
the cold air from the north. Until I came here to the

38:49.111 --> 38:55.400
border, to the banks of the Rio Grande, there in 
Miacuña and Piedra Nera, there I came to see the

38:49.111 --> 38:55.400
north. It wasn't cold there. In the morning, just 
like in that time, it was just scorching. And it was

39:01.449 --> 39:07.438
like ice in the night, that dawns whitening. That 
was all there was. But there was no cold air. It was

39:12.490 --> 39:15.293
beautiful. The plants don't wash because they 
freeze hard, like here. Here in the north it's cold

39:22.119 --> 39:26.844
and it burns things. If it was cold like here, there 
wouldn't be that kind of plants in the pastas.

39:35.212 --> 39:36.173
Maguey doesn't freeze. Nor does nopal. But there 
are other plants that do freeze. And that's what

39:42.646 --> 39:43.787
was there. And a lot of people plant outside. They 
have a lot of land. They plant everything there in

39:49.133 --> 39:54.419
the work they do. They plant corn. Between the 
corn, they planted beans. They planted pumpkin.

40:02.529 --> 40:05.071
Do you know what that is? Yes. Well, there's 
another plant that they call corn from Teja. It's a

40:09.977 --> 40:10.898
big wheel. Corn from Texas? Corn from Texas, they 
call it. It's bigger. They plant it here and it

40:15.848 --> 40:20.277
grows, and here they plant it like this. And those 
grains are filled with those little balls. Yes.

40:23.784 --> 40:27.151
Well, all this was given between corn, and here 
it's not given. Here it burns. The same heat of the

40:28.411 --> 40:31.995
corn doesn't let it dry. And that's how it is. When 
the corn is dry, they cut it. And they do it a lot. And

40:41.908 --> 40:45.212
then you see the land that looks like the land of so 
many pumpkins. Of all of them. It's for the same

40:46.774 --> 40:51.180
people. They use it for many things. Now the beans 
are the same as the corn. Because there in Mexico,

40:58.718 --> 41:03.224
years have passed and I don't know how it will be 
now. Because since I came from there, from

41:03.284 --> 41:11.716
Hacienda Piotrillo, from 2012, I haven't gone 
back there. It was in 1912. 1912 that I came here to

41:12.557 --> 41:16.402
the river, to the border here. To the border. What 
were you doing? Why did you go to the border?

41:21.972 --> 41:28.539
Because my father is here, in this place, in the 
middle of Piedras Negras and Viacuña. And he

41:28.559 --> 41:32.384
brought them from there, so we could come to where 
he was. And that's why we came from there. That's

41:35.748 --> 41:40.633
why I tell you that he didn't... And what kind of 
work did he have on the border? Here, agriculture.

41:42.315 --> 41:44.658
Agriculture, too. In that place... Because that 
man... He was from Monterrey. He had a lot of land

41:52.837 --> 41:57.182
between Piedaneras and Viacuña. And he sent a man 
to come here to Texas to talk to the Mexicans who

41:57.202 --> 42:07.133
were sowing here. And I told them, well, I was 
coming here to the house. And as I was coming here,

42:11.578 --> 42:18.485
he said, well, say hello. Well, you are sowing 
here. ¿Qué condiciones le da aquí el Señor a usted?

42:23.111 --> 42:26.355

42:50.870 --> 42:57.760
set a limit. In money that you need to move the work, 
you're just going to change. And if another

43:01.826 --> 43:13.684
person, another Mexican man, had mules and 
everything to do the work, he had guayines, you

43:01.826 --> 43:13.684
know what guayines are? Yes. Well, he had 
guayines, he had cows. Well, they took everything

43:18.011 --> 43:20.134
he had. And they didn't cost a cent. Everything was 
for free. The man. He was just going to pay for the

43:26.826 --> 43:30.771
family's passage. On the train. On the train? On 
the train. From the farm to the... From where they

43:33.255 --> 43:36.319
were, there to Piedras Negras. Yes, from his farm 
to Piedras Negras. The whole family. Yes, the

43:40.065 --> 43:41.727
