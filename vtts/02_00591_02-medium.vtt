00:04.064 --> 00:24.203
When

00:04.064 --> 00:24.203
he's here with us, there's my heart standing 
still. When he says that Franco's still there, I

00:24.223 --> 00:25.224
can die. When he talks dirty on that phone, it's 
like he's talking to me. I go to pieces when he

00:26.546 --> 00:27.386
sneezes in his tie. When he's out caroling for us, 
you know I'm never bored. He says, no problem, but I

00:28.547 --> 00:29.548
wish that he could see. There is a problem. Mind, 
because I want you so much. But if he takes me in his

00:30.649 --> 00:31.270
arms,

00:37.021 --> 00:48.381
Fall

00:37.021 --> 00:48.381
in love.

00:55.398 --> 01:17.134
I

00:55.398 --> 01:17.134
know this shouldn't be said, I wish his girlfriend 
were dead, but a tragic accident will end my scene

00:55.398 --> 01:17.134
as well. So when in heaven we meet, I will be able to 
say, my, I'm Mrs. Jeffy Chase and you're mine.

01:18.997 --> 01:20.380
Jenny, Jenny, I love when you fall down each 
Saturday night on my TV. Oh, but Jenny.

01:25.132 --> 01:36.370
Once

01:25.132 --> 01:36.370
he

01:25.132 --> 01:36.370
came to see me in my dressing room. Duke helped. He 
asked for a match. It broke down my heart, too. The

01:42.901 --> 01:43.401
show began. He turned to go. He said goodbye. Oh, 
no! I begged him to stay. I thought I would die. Oh,

01:46.386 --> 01:46.667
the ghost! The ghost! The ghost! The ghost! The 
ghost! He walked into a wall, and there was nothing

01:47.568 --> 01:51.274
I could do about it. Thank

01:53.971 --> 02:08.841
you.

02:19.334 --> 02:27.076
Saturday night will be right back after this word 
from the first shoot she's done for the

02:19.334 --> 02:27.076
day. And so with a name like Pluckers, it's got to be 
good. Hey, hold on a second. I have a game here

02:32.692 --> 02:34.457
called...

02:59.969 --> 03:17.809
Thank

02:59.969 --> 03:17.809
you.

03:20.810 --> 03:32.318
Oh,

03:20.810 --> 03:32.318
my angel is the centiphone. Angel is the 
centiphone. My blood runs cold. My memory has just

03:33.240 --> 03:33.862
been stolen. Angel is the centiphone.

03:50.408 --> 04:09.082
It's

03:50.408 --> 04:09.082
okay, I understand that this ain't no never, never 
land. Oh, that when this fish is gone, I'll see you

04:09.102 --> 04:10.445
with your clothes on. Take your car, yes we will. 
Take your car and drive it. Take it to a motel room

04:11.587 --> 04:12.669
and take them all for driving. A car to me has just 
been ripped. The pages from my mind are stripped.

04:14.111 --> 04:14.492
Oh no, I can't die.

04:18.927 --> 04:36.835
¶¶

04:18.927 --> 04:36.835
¶¶ ¶¶

05:02.245 --> 05:17.406
Let's

05:02.245 --> 05:17.406
go. Let's go. Let's go.

10:23.967 --> 10:46.988
I wouldn't

10:23.967 --> 10:46.988
do

10:23.967 --> 10:46.988
anything at all.

10:53.482 --> 11:01.133
with someone that you do not know. You definitely

11:01.153 --> 11:09.725
know that it's a counterfeit bill based on the fact 
that it's been raised from 1 to 20. Or that you know

11:09.745 --> 11:14.672
that there are no fibers that are so badly 
reproduced that anyone can tell that it's

11:09.745 --> 11:14.672
counterfeit. Then you have two options. Number 
one, you do not want to

11:25.139 --> 11:29.108
but not an innocent person passing the bill, 
counterfeit bill.

12:05.285 --> 12:10.231
and call the... Peter Dallas, you called us. We can 
verify whether it's a counterfeiter.

12:35.255 --> 12:57.547
Try

12:35.255 --> 12:57.547
and hold on

12:35.255 --> 12:57.547
to the bill if it's obviously a counterfeit, and 
then try and get some mental description of the

12:35.255 --> 12:57.547
person that was there so you can write it down right 
away. And follow them to the door. If you look at a

12:58.148 --> 12:59.149
car, they get the license number. We get a lot of our 
information off the license numbers. Whether or

13:00.311 --> 13:01.633
not the bill is retained in that small store or 
shop,

13:16.615 --> 13:36.940
And so we've made a lot of cases

13:16.615 --> 13:36.940
by alert shop owners, keepers, helpers, just 
observing what the person looked like, writing it

13:16.615 --> 13:36.940
down, and getting the license tag. But never be a 
jeopardizer of life. You have to play that

13:37.681 --> 13:39.503
situation as it comes up. With people that are 
counterfeiting bills, you know, printing them

13:39.523 --> 13:45.711
out, is it real easy on a good replica Um, for, I 
mean, how easy is it to tell that it is a

13:45.961 --> 13:51.010
counterfeit? It's, uh, it's easy to counterfeit

13:51.811 --> 14:03.612
a film because the photo process is used in the 
offset printing machine. It's also easy to tell

14:03.632 --> 14:06.998
the counterfeit film. Now, depending on the pains 
that they take,

14:14.530 --> 14:32.893
That's

14:14.530 --> 14:32.893
why the law reads that it's illegal

15:04.970 --> 15:07.247
to see if it's flight-like. If it's rather 
three-dimensional, does it stand out?

15:43.546 --> 16:00.475
would

15:43.546 --> 16:00.475
be the way a layperson should do it. It's going to be 
hard for them to look and see if the broken lines are

16:00.495 --> 16:03.781
in the hair or the lines are completed and that sort 
of thing. Now, if you take a bill and rub the ink off

16:03.801 --> 16:05.343
of it, that's an old wives' tale. I've heard that 
many times. Tell the counter for the bill because

16:05.924 --> 16:07.046
the ink comes off. But the ink will come off if 
that's a health bill.

16:13.094 --> 16:32.055
I

16:13.094 --> 16:32.055
guess that those who handled money a lot, 
especially bank tellers, can feel right away.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.138
I've asked many of them, when they caught a count of 
the bill, how they did it. It said by the field, what

16:34.158 --> 16:36.120
do you know about the fibers, the portrait, how it 
looks, and all that. We just know that it doesn't

16:36.140 --> 16:36.941
feel right. I'm sure you could tell a lot from 
those. Those who handled money a lot probably

16:37.802 --> 16:39.204
could tell quicker than others. And I can recall 
the first or second day that I was in the job,

17:00.884 --> 17:18.381
the

17:00.884 --> 17:18.381
call

17:00.884 --> 17:18.381
from a fellow who owned a jewelry store up to the 
north and said, would you like a chicken barrel?

17:18.401 --> 17:22.085
And I said, yes, that is a counterfeit based on the 
front plate numbers and all those other

17:18.401 --> 17:22.085
identifying characteristics that we talked 
about earlier, and I'll be right out to get it. You

17:22.105 --> 17:22.625
know where you got it? No, I don't know where I got 
it. It's just in the cash drawer. I went right out to

17:23.927 --> 17:26.309
get it, and as soon as I got there, he said, well, 
where that is, somebody must have passed it off. It

17:26.329 --> 17:26.689
was right here. So in other words, he knew that

17:43.898 --> 18:08.134
So,

17:43.898 --> 18:08.134
we have some of those around there, innocent 
women, and we don't see that as the U.S. Attorney

17:43.898 --> 18:08.134
Library, as far as those individuals who get 
caught

18:13.025 --> 18:17.256
And are there much, there's a lot of counterfeit 
bills there. Do they do much in coins? Not anymore.

18:22.890 --> 18:24.655
In fact, you can do almost anything to a coin.

19:00.832 --> 19:19.735
obviously,

19:00.832 --> 19:19.735
but the process now of altering ink oil, of course, 
to Hispanic value is very, the technology is far

19:00.832 --> 19:19.735
beyond what it used to be, so it's possible to enter 
and alter

19:33.940 --> 19:40.431
very knowledgeable

19:33.940 --> 19:40.431
to help us out, plus our laboratory wasn't. But as 
far as the street agents and myself, we don't have

19:40.451 --> 19:41.757
that

19:55.253 --> 20:04.870
And the last thing is, what about, like, they're 
talking about government checks and people

19:55.253 --> 20:04.870
changing names or values on them. Is that, do you 
see much of that? Changing the names and the value

20:09.037 --> 20:11.562
of the check. Yeah. Altering the check. Altering a 
check. Yes.

20:40.428 --> 20:56.757
address,

20:40.428 --> 20:56.757
first of the same name got it. Forgery 
involvement, we work pretty hard. You cannot

20:58.480 --> 20:59.582
forge someone's name on the back of a check. But by 
the same token, there are other statutes that we

20:59.603 --> 21:00.845
cover. You cannot possess it with intention to 
fraud or conspire either. You can't do that. But

21:02.668 --> 21:03.229
occasionally we have

21:37.482 --> 21:41.994
Now, what now happens in an operation like that? I 
pay heed.

22:48.728 --> 22:51.598
Is there any way of catching the person doing that? 
Well, we do from time to time. Just prior

22:56.555 --> 23:00.308
investigation, catch them by using the 
holographic machine.

24:15.719 --> 24:16.822
Well, that's all real interesting. What are your 
plans for the future? What are you going to do? Do

24:20.732 --> 24:23.400
you have any upcoming? I don't know. Are we 
debating a future? Yeah.

24:49.638 --> 24:54.619
for

24:49.638 --> 24:54.619
any number of protectees and candidates that will 
come into the town because we...

26:04.580 --> 26:20.359
But

26:04.580 --> 26:20.359
all of us are cross-trained to do each other's job, 
whether it's protection of counterfeiting to

26:04.580 --> 26:20.359
undercover, or driving the press, or doing 
built-in surveys, or just the type of reports.

26:20.379 --> 26:21.582
Everybody's trained and cross-trained to do 
everybody's job. So we're small, but we know what

26:21.602 --> 26:22.504
we're doing.

26:37.283 --> 26:41.607
What would that, what is the alcohol?

27:31.250 --> 27:44.290
abolish one, make it one

27:31.250 --> 27:44.290
agency and do a better job. Face the

27:44.310 --> 27:49.678
job. So that's what they're thinking about doing. 
We would be getting in like 1,200 new agents from

27:51.501 --> 27:53.464
Errol. And that's good. That'd be a lot of folks to 
do all the work out. We would train in that area and

27:55.146 --> 27:56.288
they would train in ours. That would be pretty 
good. That would help us a lot. It would be an

27:58.171 --> 27:59.012
enormous undertaking.

28:15.260 --> 28:25.253
Okay,

28:15.260 --> 28:25.253
but Steve, you're really happy with doing this?
