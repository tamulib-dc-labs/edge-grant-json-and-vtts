WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:03.416
How about Jack Williams? Any recollections? Oh, 
fine. We didn't see him too much socially, but I'm

00:08.644 --> 00:26.368
just basking in Frank's feelings of him, that he 
was the finest administrator that I've reckoned

00:08.644 --> 00:26.368
I've

00:08.644 --> 00:26.368
known. And he was smart. Yeah, I think you 
certainly know that. And he really worked hard.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.034
You know, all those people worked hard. Yes, they 
did. That's impressive. Yeah. And Buck Weiris I

00:36.776 --> 00:40.079
remember worked hard, harder than anybody I knew. 
Yeah, I was impressed with Buck. And who was that

00:43.062 --> 00:48.568
guy who was in the library?

00:53.753 --> 00:54.273
In the library? Buck Weiris, my man's gone too. He

00:56.055 --> 01:00.379
was head of the library? No, he had something to do 
with the library. After he retired, he was hired on

01:04.140 --> 01:09.925
the part. If it comes to the library. Wouldn't Don 
die all or something? I don't think about that. He

01:16.711 --> 01:19.593
was always there for the students. I mean, mostly 
student-oriented. Yeah. That's important. You

01:26.139 --> 01:29.742
can always tell a student-oriented professor 
knows you or not. And I'm one of those who wasn't.

01:32.148 --> 01:41.622
And I'll tell you, when you have 350 students in 
your classes, it's hard to think of anything else.

01:41.682 --> 01:43.565
Well, you don't have to go to school anymore. Fight 
that anymore.

01:47.691 --> 01:52.418
What would you like to tell me about your 
experiences at A&M? Well, the key word is fun.

01:54.842 --> 01:55.883
Really, it is. It was constantly fun. And that's 
what I see in Frank's letters. This is a happy

02:01.400 --> 02:02.521
place. Yes. Over and over. This is happy. And he 
really . Now also, I think I mentioned this. I was

02:11.150 --> 02:12.051
really surprised. He really was planning his 
retirement from the very first. His letters are

02:16.015 --> 02:17.376
full of it. I'm going to do this in memory. Well, he 
knew you were 61. Yeah. Was he there four years?

02:23.222 --> 02:23.502
Yeah. That's an awful short time. He did a lot. It 
seemed to me he was there much longer. It just

02:30.619 --> 02:32.061
seemed like so long. And also Lloyd really took 
hold. Yeah. In fact, I learned a lot about Lloyd

02:37.850 --> 02:41.015
reading that correspondence. And I'd say Lloyd 
and I were always good friends. But I didn't know

02:43.579 --> 02:45.983
Lloyd was a good administrator. He was tough. He 
was right on top of it. He wrote letters. And Frank

02:49.591 --> 02:51.113
was a good lover. A wonderful writer, period. I'm 
just so sorry that he got so ill so he couldn't write

02:53.937 --> 02:59.184
his memoirs. That would have been great. It would 
have been wonderful if he did write his memoirs.

03:08.537 --> 03:10.039
And so fast. He told me a story here that he would go 
in on Sunday for a couple of hours and it would take

03:10.059 --> 03:19.092
his secretary All day, Monday, he'd read his 
letters, what he had done on it. He'd read the

03:25.381 --> 03:28.044
letter. He'd come in early in the morning, six 
o'clock. Do you remember a lady named Jeanette

03:30.988 --> 03:44.365
Hennigan, who worked with him for a little while 
when you all first came to... Buck Wires gave me

03:30.988 --> 03:44.365
that name, and I haven't called her yet, but I don't 
remember her name. I don't remember that. Okay,

03:44.846 --> 03:46.007
that's kind of what... Any

03:46.848 --> 04:04.848
other people that you remember interacting with 
particularly besides Bob Shewitz? And John

04:04.868 --> 04:06.050
Lindsay, I guess. Yes, John was often involved. 
Williams was there. How about Haskell? Haskell,

04:14.591 --> 04:17.153
no. He was around a lot. Very helpful. Haskell's 
coming back to College Station this summer. He's

04:23.539 --> 04:24.280
retiring. Is he? From Missouri. He was an El Paso 
president. Went to El Paso as president, then he

04:28.924 --> 04:35.049
went to Missouri as chancellor, whatever it was, 
and then stepped down. You know how that goes.

04:36.771 --> 04:39.433
Stayed up there, though, as a history professor. 
for about four more years, and now he's come back.

04:45.891 --> 04:46.111
Well, fine. Yeah. And his son, he has one of his sons 
who's a doctor in Palm State. In fact, we've been to

04:50.317 --> 04:51.518
him. He's an anesthesiologist or something. 
Didn't know his children.

04:59.868 --> 05:00.970
Anyway, he's coming back. I thought Haskell was 
involved. Was Frank Vanderbilt? Yes. Yeah, now,

05:05.715 --> 05:09.420
see, Frank didn't come in, kind of thing, when he 
became president. Jack Williams had a heart

05:10.632 --> 05:12.694
attack, you know. Yes. And he kind of faded, and he 
came back for a while, and then retired, and then

05:13.155 --> 05:18.721
Vandiver came. And Vandiver, I believe, had 
already gone. Well, Frank was a friend of

05:21.864 --> 05:24.126
Vandiver's. Way before. Way back. Yeah. There are 
letters from Frank Vandiver to, between he and

05:25.648 --> 05:34.057
Wardlaw, 73 or 74

05:25.648 --> 05:34.057
or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. And I need to go 
talk to Frank. But I would... I don't know. I think

05:41.049 --> 05:43.812
from the time Frank was here, 1950. Probably so. I 
wouldn't be surprised because apparently

05:45.313 --> 05:49.918
Frank's father was a professor here. Yes, I think 
so. Frank Bender is the only person I've ever heard

05:55.404 --> 06:05.074
of who skipped junior high and high school. I don't 
even know if he ever got an undergraduate degree.

06:07.193 --> 06:09.997
He got a Ph.D. I don't know. He didn't bother with 
all that other stuff. He just got his Ph.D. and went

06:13.023 --> 06:15.026
on. I really like Frank. He's a nice man. Still on 
the go around there. I don't see him on the campus.

06:24.623 --> 06:26.106
He can't get on the campus anymore. The parking is 
so horrible. He kind of quit. I'm going to talk to

06:30.974 --> 06:34.959
him, because I know when he came in, he did a lot for 
the press. Yes. And I know he didn't know. I

06:37.563 --> 06:38.243
remember him. I saw him bring in Black Jack, the 
Persian. Yeah, Persian, yeah. I watched him. Oh,

06:44.892 --> 06:45.313
did you? Make two trips up the stairs with his 
manuscript. Did you? Yes. Okay, that's a good

06:49.358 --> 06:50.880
story. That's a good story. I'll remind Frank of 
that, of that moment. Let's see. What else can we

07:01.147 --> 07:05.316
talk about that would be interesting? I guess, as 
far as you were concerned, there was no culture

07:05.797 --> 07:10.808
shock at Texas A&M. You liked what you found. I 
liked it. Because that's what a lot of people say.

07:15.858 --> 07:16.219
These are Aggies. Well, I hadn't heard anything 
since having just come from Kansas. I hadn't

07:19.740 --> 07:20.080
heard. That's right. That's right. I don't think I 
remember Maggie Joke when I came to Texas. I don't

07:25.165 --> 07:28.168
believe they were around much until the 60s or 70s 
anyway. I don't remember Maggie Joke. Not even

07:31.451 --> 07:37.236
when I was

07:31.451 --> 07:37.236
here in Texas. I do remember we often looked at that 
statue on the campus, which was constantly being

07:37.256 --> 07:42.861
painted. Sol Ross. Oh, yes, Sol Ross. Yeah, Sol 
Ross. And we would walk almost every night, and it

07:47.536 --> 07:53.805
would seem like every month they'd get another 
coat of paint on it. Yeah. They finally made them

07:54.846 --> 07:59.032
stop polishing so well, because they were 
polishing all the brass off. Oh, sure. Losing his

07:59.693 --> 08:02.437
whatever, you know. So they had kind of stopped all 
that

08:03.779 --> 08:10.989
now. I should have brought you a... Did you get a 
copy of that last... The Press just published? No,

08:20.232 --> 08:20.893
I didn't. I told Kayla to cease it. Look, I've got 
all those books there from A&M. To stop sending you

08:27.003 --> 08:28.185
those? To stop sending them, just sending these 
particular ones. But anyway, in that book I saw

08:33.173 --> 08:37.980
Ross's statue. They built a statue for General 
Rudder. Oh, did they? Yeah. Oh, I remember Mrs.

08:43.072 --> 08:44.834
Webber. Yeah, she's still out. Charming lady, 
really nice lady. Is she still with me? Still busy.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.863
Oh, she was at, I went to a meeting. What is she, 95? I 
don't think so. I don't know. She must have been a

08:53.727 --> 08:55.590
lot younger. Yeah, a lot younger. And I'm sure she 
may be pushing 80, but she looks good. When she was

09:00.276 --> 09:06.184
at a meeting, we went to the Westerner's meeting 
last night. Wednesday night, yeah. And she was

09:08.628 --> 09:10.230
there in just great shape. Anyway, she's been 
fussing at me because I... In that picture book,

09:13.531 --> 09:22.953
that revision we did, we have Saul Ross's statue, 
but not Mr. Rutter's

09:13.531 --> 09:22.953
statue. I did wrong.
