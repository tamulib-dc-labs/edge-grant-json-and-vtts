00:01.837 --> 00:08.605
Now, on this College Hills area, were there a lot of 
trees on this area, or were most of these trees

00:01.837 --> 00:08.605
planted? Was this mostly cotton fields? This was 
primarily a cotton field area. When I first moved

00:14.092 --> 00:23.163
into this home in about 39, you could still see the 
old drills throughout the area. Incidentally,

00:24.605 --> 00:30.612
the city hall that you see down here, too, done 
during my tenure as mayor we used to be located over

00:32.093 --> 01:00.109
in the old city hall that's at the north gate over 
there right and prior to that well when we first

00:32.093 --> 01:00.109
started out as a city we were in the building a 
two-story building over on south side that

00:32.093 --> 01:00.109
constituted our office part-time secretary and 
city manager and the city council It was very small

01:00.848 --> 01:19.140
indeed, and gradually we went over to, we finally 
went to the north side, Northgate area, and then

01:00.848 --> 01:19.140
proceeded to, with the new city hall in the 
location where it is now. And it was about that

01:20.302 --> 01:26.232
time, or at that time, that we also instituted a 
fire department with some of our own men, and you

01:27.123 --> 01:32.168
were acquainted, of course, with the fire station 
here. I was curious about that a while ago. You said

01:33.729 --> 01:40.135
something about the A&M providing the fire 
protection for our college station at that time.

01:40.615 --> 01:49.103
Now, could you give me an example or something, or 
do you ever remember when there was a fire, and how

01:40.615 --> 01:49.103
did that actually work, anyway? Well, when 
there's a fire, Jerry, well, we usually call the

01:49.163 --> 01:56.590
fire number over at the power plant, And they had 
the fire truck readiness at all times. So it served

02:01.437 --> 02:10.210
as our... Now, we did pay a nominal amount to the 
university for the service at the time. But I know

02:11.091 --> 02:13.355
that it cost them quite a bit. And, of course, even 
those that served in the fire department were

02:13.375 --> 02:20.967
volunteer firemen. Most of them worked in the 
power plant or in an area that... In case of the

02:25.544 --> 02:32.171
fire, well, the truck went by, and they jumped on 
the truck, and off they went to help us out. I see.

02:34.914 --> 02:35.014
Yeah. But I think it's interesting to point out, 
too, that some of my opposition, when I was trying

02:35.034 --> 02:52.553
to get the bond issue passed for the city hall and 
the fire station, said that we did not need a fire

02:35.034 --> 02:52.553
station. He did not reckon this was a council 
meeting. And he didn't want a fire station. He said

02:57.104 --> 03:05.841
that it would be better if a home were to burn to the 
ground and get full restitution rather than have a

02:57.104 --> 03:05.841
fire department. Now, this is some of the 
philosophy that I was bucking and trying to make

03:08.322 --> 03:11.807
for a progressive community. I was going to say, it 
doesn't seem to be too progressive for a

03:11.827 --> 03:14.650
councilman. No, but this was the view I... As a 
matter of fact, when I went in and first had all this

03:15.011 --> 03:33.635
trouble on the city council and they were voting 
down everything that I was trying to do for the

03:15.011 --> 03:33.635
community, I got with the news people, the radio 
station and newspapers. Yeah, the TV was then...

03:36.942 --> 03:48.621
Yeah, the TV station was then here, and explained 
to them my dilemma, and I sought their

03:36.942 --> 03:48.621
cooperation. And Mike Mistovich pledged that he 
would boost my presentation on the TV station.

04:00.449 --> 04:07.278
That has boosted in terms of letting the public 
know that I was to appear several weeks before I

04:00.449 --> 04:07.278
appeared on TV. And that was, I had the one-hour 
program right after Kosygin, who was in the United

04:08.499 --> 04:19.173
States, and it had a good listening audience. And I 
went prepared with charts and maps. and spoke to

04:25.205 --> 04:28.389
the public for one hour. It was public service 
time. I had a good listening audience. That's

04:32.774 --> 04:33.635
prime time. It sounded like that. That's right. 
And right after, Kosygin was featured. And I

04:39.162 --> 04:43.727
invited the public out to the next council 
meeting. And at the next council meeting, I

04:44.548 --> 04:54.300
brought up things that the public were interested 
in, but the majority against me would not endorse.

04:55.377 --> 05:03.447
Well, following that meeting, that was all that 
was needed on the part of the public to get riled up.

05:04.388 --> 05:13.600
And at the next council election, well, the people 
themselves saw that they went out with a landslide

05:04.388 --> 05:13.600
against them. And it was only then that we were able 
to get in gear and do many of the things that needed

05:13.620 --> 05:22.110
to be done in the community. As I said, you know, 
there were so many things that we lacked, and the

05:22.867 --> 05:31.498
university started to grow, and we needed to keep 
up with that growth. We needed to encourage the

05:32.620 --> 05:49.802
building of homes, and we needed to institute 
ordinances that were necessary, like fire code,

05:32.620 --> 05:49.802
building code, ordinances that had to do with 
zoning, and things of this nature. And for years,

05:50.727 --> 06:05.068
we had, I mean, we were just all the time trying to 
step out and be a little forward in all these areas.

06:05.088 --> 06:07.792
Well, the zoning, what was the most of the zoning? 
Was it mostly residential type zoning at that time

06:07.812 --> 06:10.896
when you first? Well, residential primarily. And 
of course, then eventually we got into zoning for

06:13.119 --> 06:19.789
business and the like. But when did this, I know 
this shopping center over here now is probably

06:21.338 --> 06:30.528
the, it's been here for as long as I know it was one of 
the first ones that I can remember when I was going

06:21.338 --> 06:30.528
to school here. Well, that was four years ago, big 
deal. But this shopping center over here, when did

06:32.871 --> 06:34.853
that first go in? Was it Gibson's? Oh, well, 
that's, yeah. Oh, gee, you know, I get rusty on

06:39.038 --> 06:42.141
dates.

06:45.024 --> 06:45.945
In the 60s, was it? Yeah, that must have been the 
late, Yeah, that was about the middle 60s when that

06:49.469 --> 06:56.836
area was developed because there was nothing in 
there. I mean, that was all open land as is the area

06:56.936 --> 07:02.701
across the street there, the highway. That was 
all. You remember who that land was owned by?

07:06.625 --> 07:09.348
People over there before it was sold? There were 
several ownerships. I don't recall just who they

07:11.430 --> 07:14.713
were. I see. But... That was practically all 
farmland from there south. There was nothing in

07:22.816 --> 07:25.519
there. Now, speaking of park area, just a moment, 
Jerry. If I might, we had the Lincoln School. It was

07:36.275 --> 07:40.641
a Negro school where the Lincoln Center now is. And 
that area burned. And at that period in our school

07:44.506 --> 07:47.691
history, Then the Negro population was moved into 
the white school, and we have been integrated ever

07:48.295 --> 07:57.024
since. Well, now that left that facility down 
there, that was school property and unoccupied.

08:05.312 --> 08:15.062
And the city council made a deal with the school 
system whereby we would use that as a recreational

08:05.312 --> 08:15.062
area. And I recall I got a lot of criticism again on 
this by moving out in this direction, but I think

08:15.970 --> 08:28.048
time has proved that it has served a good need in 
that community. Now, we had a lot of problems to

08:29.150 --> 08:39.145
start with, very discouraging, because at night 
people would knock out the glass and break the

08:29.150 --> 08:39.145
doors and the furniture. And I'll tell you, I 
became discouraged lots of times. But faith

08:45.063 --> 08:57.877
prevailed, and fortunately today, it's taken 
care of, and I'm glad that it is serving the need in

08:45.063 --> 08:57.877
that particular community. Now, the swimming 
pool, of course, at one time, we were directly, you

08:58.658 --> 09:14.395
might say, well, all my children and others of 
faculty and staff, the recreational activities

08:58.658 --> 09:14.395
were actually provided by Texas A&M. And with the 
increasing use by the students, it became obvious

09:15.185 --> 09:25.239
that gradually we would have to get off campus, 
just like our school. The university actually

09:25.299 --> 09:28.663
nurtured our city. I see. And like in the school, 
while we saw and we could foresee that we needed a

09:29.625 --> 09:39.358
swimming pool, we needed the development of our 
parks and things of this nature. So, of course,

09:39.378 --> 09:43.183
this was another forward step that we had to make. 
with the limited finances that we had available to

09:43.703 --> 09:47.149
us. The school for College Station children was on 
the campus, and then when it moved off, it moved off

09:47.610 --> 09:57.348
to where it still is now. The chicken coops. Right. 
Where they call them the chicken coops. I see.

10:10.366 --> 10:30.574
Well, as I said, the university actually nurtured 
the city and gradually it became necessary for us

10:10.366 --> 10:30.574
in terms of water, the school, recreation, 
housing, things of this nature to take over and

10:10.366 --> 10:30.574
gradually go ahead. I'm happy to say that we have 
done it on a very reasonable As a city, we do not have

10:36.792 --> 10:41.078
a large indebtedness. It's not one that we can't 
carry with the bonds that we have. We've been

10:45.664 --> 10:47.727
pretty much a pay-as-you-go. We've tried to, or at 
least I did when I was on the council, work with the

10:49.149 --> 10:56.278
leaders of the student body. Matter of fact, the 
lights that were put on the west side of the campus

10:57.119 --> 11:05.230
to prevent where the students parked their cars 
here in late years. Working with the university,

11:06.104 --> 11:14.893
we chipped in on the cost for the mercury vapor 
lights that's on the west side of the campus. And

11:14.913 --> 11:22.020
this was even brought out in court against me when 
they had me down here in county court. They

11:22.040 --> 11:26.105
criticized me for working with the university and 
the students. And my position then was, as it is

11:27.226 --> 11:33.192
now, that the student body itself helped pay for 
this through the sales tax and other things that

11:33.779 --> 11:39.204
they purchased. And we rightfully need to 
compensate them for what they did.

11:47.993 --> 12:02.807
I think the student body as a whole that got larger, 
I guess, had a lot more of a buying power in the

11:47.993 --> 12:02.807
stores and merchandise in this area, and it's 
something that needed to be not really

11:47.993 --> 12:02.807
compensated for, but needed to be understood and 
respect it, I guess, because they... Oh, yes,

12:03.530 --> 12:06.774
definitely so. You can judge this by the business 
activities during the holiday period when the

12:08.496 --> 12:14.682
students are not here. Right. And this I respect 
very much, and I've always said that, of course, I

12:15.984 --> 12:31.461
wear a college station on my heart

12:15.984 --> 12:31.461
in terms of the pride in my city and the university. 
Of course, being a university employee, or having

12:32.234 --> 12:48.774
been one, and very loyal to my city, and having been 
brought up when people were against us, you might

12:32.234 --> 12:48.774
say, imposed on me a little more loyalty, perhaps, 
than some new newcomer coming in today.

12:52.118 --> 12:53.820
You might say, well, you're an old-timer. Yes, I'm 
an old-timer, but I remember you know the growing

12:56.838 --> 13:22.744
city and what it meant to us and how hard we strive to 
even though when we put in our little consolidated

12:56.838 --> 13:22.744
school over here we had a very small enrollment and 
with what taxes we had trying to expand that system

12:56.838 --> 13:22.744
we almost every month or so we had a program of some 
kind to try to raise money to put in sidewalks

13:23.332 --> 13:25.174
provide this or provide that. We just, we came up 
the hard way. Right. And this is part of that

13:28.278 --> 13:32.964
loyalty that I referred to. Right.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.835
We, you got a little more there, Jim? Yeah, you go 
ahead. I'm just looking over, you know, the little

13:41.936 --> 13:48.124
sheet that I have here, and in terms of Showing 
leadership, I always took this position, joining

13:49.268 --> 14:05.387
with the council, the council joining with me, 
that we were planning to make College Station a

13:49.268 --> 14:05.387
showpiece for any city, I mean, with the progress. 
And for a while, you know, I'm thinking here of the

14:05.527 --> 14:13.116
public health issue of mosquitoes and diseases 
that it carries. And we were one of the first cities

14:17.767 --> 14:28.621
in this part of the country to institute the traps 
that would catch mosquitoes. Well, now when was

14:29.202 --> 14:32.006
this work started in this area? Oh, I would say, 
Jerry, that was around 1967. And the purpose

14:36.813 --> 14:40.858
there, of course, was to prevent disease. And 
these mosquitoes were then shipped down to

14:43.175 --> 14:47.140
Houston and looked at. But for Brazos County, this 
was the first that we instituted. And now another

14:51.065 --> 15:08.128
thing that I pushed very hard was this emergency 
telephone number, 99, 911, that very few people

14:51.065 --> 15:08.128
are aware of today, and I regret that they are not 
acquainted with it. Because in times of

15:08.935 --> 15:21.633
emergency, if the number 911 was drilled into a 
person's mind, you could dial this number in the

15:08.935 --> 15:21.633
dark. It is a universal number that is used in many 
parts of the United States and in foreign

15:21.653 --> 15:29.765
countries, even Canada. And I tried to, well, I did 
bring this innovation into this area. And at the

15:34.265 --> 15:41.372
time I was working on it, I asked the city of Bryan if 
they were interested in coming in with me, and they

15:34.265 --> 15:41.372
were not. The county was not interested. So 
single-handedly, we pushed this for College

15:44.536 --> 15:48.480
Station. And this is another first. We were one of 
the few cities in the state of Texas to have this

15:50.782 --> 15:55.307
emergency number. Now, unfortunately, I did not 
live, I mean, my service as mayor was such that the

16:03.290 --> 16:07.395
system was installed shortly after I left. And 
unfortunately, the people were made unaware of

16:08.496 --> 16:15.645
the importance of this number. Now, this 911 is 
dialed into our police station, and they have a

16:15.665 --> 16:27.140
record down there of any message through 911 is 
emergency. And they have a list of doctors and

16:28.241 --> 16:32.166
anybody else that you might need in terms of an 
emergency. Now, a recent event just happened here

16:35.387 --> 16:44.618
in College Station where a man had a heart attack. 
The wife went to the telephone. She didn't know the

16:46.361 --> 16:48.723
doctor's number. She didn't think about even 
trying to dial zero. She was frustrated while her

16:53.369 --> 16:57.394
husband had a heart attack out in the lot. Here is 
where I say that if this 911 was indelibly

16:58.927 --> 17:12.206
impressed on everybody's mind in terms of a heart 
attack, if you need oxygen, if you need a doctor in

16:58.927 --> 17:12.206
an emergency, things of this nature. There's a 
prowler outside your window. Your wife could

17:14.850 --> 17:22.421
discreetly go to the phone in the dark and number 
911 and get the prowler in the act. Unfortunately,

17:22.441 --> 17:26.487
this has not been publicized enough really 
warrant its use today. But it's very, very

17:29.152 --> 17:31.436
unfortunate. Well, how about in the area of public 
health and care? What has, have there been any

17:34.641 --> 17:38.446
ideas considered for a hospital, a college 
station hospital? Are they used to use the Brazos?

17:39.728 --> 17:42.092
Is there a hospital in Bryan? We worked on this, 
Jerry, before I went out as mayor. We had hopes, and

17:48.222 --> 17:55.613
I still have hopes today, that someday we will get a 
smaller hospital out in this area. I know I was born

17:56.690 --> 18:02.538
in the hospital over here, St. Joseph's Hospital 
down in Bryan. Oh, you were? When my father was

18:03.399 --> 18:05.001
going to school here. I just wondered about that. 
Yeah. Well, then the new hospital, St. Joseph's

18:07.765 --> 18:11.790
Hospital, we worked hard to get that. That is a city 
council there, as a regional hospital. And then

18:15.776 --> 18:24.908
subsequently, the old Bryan Hospital moved from 
their location downtown up to where nearby St.

18:15.776 --> 18:24.908
Joseph's. But that is now run by a number of 
doctors. And we had hopes of getting that

18:29.124 --> 18:36.252
particular chain interested in coming out to 
college days. But in a lot of things you do, Jerry,

18:36.272 --> 18:42.539
there are politics

18:36.272 --> 18:42.539
at a higher level. And I'm not denying this. And 
this has seriously affected our city in times in

18:45.582 --> 18:51.869
the past. But the city is growing. And I have reason 
to hope that in the near future, in the next few

18:54.959 --> 19:07.914
years, we will see a hospital of some type in this 
particular area. I dare say, and I said this while

19:09.415 --> 19:18.245
as mayor, that the time will come when the city of 
College Station will be larger than the city of

19:09.415 --> 19:18.245
Bryan. Each year, the percentage of increase is 
showing this in terms of College Station over

19:19.166 --> 19:24.392
Bryan. And we will be the dominant city of the two 
cities. We have the area to the south for this

19:31.564 --> 19:39.053
particular growth. And anyone riding around the 
city today, it's so obvious the potential in this

19:39.834 --> 19:49.806
particular area in contrast to brine. Now 
limitations are set on both cities in terms of the

19:50.191 --> 20:00.082
flood plain to the east, the railroad track, and 
other university holdings to the west. But we can

20:01.163 --> 20:03.225
grow south. If and when the Milliken Dam ever comes 
in, why this will really make for an explosive

20:03.245 --> 20:14.217
situation, I believe, in our area in terms of 
population growth. And you know perhaps as well as

20:16.381 --> 20:21.586
I, that many people are coming to this area to 
retire. And we have, in the Brazos County area now,

20:22.888 --> 20:31.477
six retirees groups. And it's surprising to see 
the number of them. Of course, a lot of them are

20:35.100 --> 20:38.364
faculty and staff from A&M. But a lot of retired 
officers are coming here to live. because of the

20:43.533 --> 20:50.060
opportunities that Texas A&M presents to 
anybody. The opportunities are here for

20:50.221 --> 20:54.786
anything, so they come here. Well, when the city 
first incorporated itself, how large has it grown

20:56.327 --> 21:06.038
in size? Not in population size, mainly, but in, 
say, footage or acreage size. Can you, you know how

21:11.980 --> 21:13.043
much? Is it double, say? Oh, it's more than double. 
In terms of acreage, I'm a little rusty on the

21:16.230 --> 21:28.980
figures now, but I would say that it has increased 
10 times over what it was originally back in Well,

21:29.990 --> 21:34.262
even as late as the 1950s, it's increased that 
much. Well, you said there were six miles of

21:34.282 --> 21:40.801
difference between the Bryan and the College 
Station sea limits back in around 1939. Is that

21:40.941 --> 21:41.783
right? Yes. Well, which way... Has Brian taken 
over most of that six miles? Well, yeah. Well, see,

21:48.045 --> 21:52.830
when Brian extended their six miles, that gave 
them living room. And thus the development on

21:52.850 --> 21:57.495
Highway 6, as you see it today, primarily. Then the 
extension out towards 29th Street. Not that way.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.543
Our growth principally had to be to the south. To 
the south. Yes. Because we were limited in terms of

22:06.124 --> 22:12.571
the railroad track and university holdings to the 
west. Right. And then we have the airport out

22:13.696 --> 22:18.541
there, and this has a limiting factor on 
development there. Any structure over, you know,

22:19.462 --> 22:25.248
one story high because of the flight pattern. And 
then with the future development of that airport,

22:25.268 --> 22:42.825
and I'm sure this is coming in not too many years, 
perhaps ten years, you will see a large expansion

22:25.268 --> 22:42.825
at Easterwood to take care of all the regional 
traffic that is being generated even now. But our

22:43.632 --> 22:56.972
growth primarily is in the south and, of course, 
some to the east towards the floodplain.

22:56.992 --> 23:02.400
Well, now, on that floodplain limitation, that's 
for the Navasota River, is that right? Yeah,

23:03.281 --> 23:03.922
that's right. Now, of course, we, in terms of 
ordinances, We put in the sewage disposal plant

23:12.235 --> 23:18.181
down there just before I got on the council. Before 
that, here's another instance where we're tied

23:19.743 --> 23:29.252
into the university, and eventually we went to our 
own sewage disposal plant. In the case of meat, we

23:30.794 --> 23:37.821
had a problem, as any cities do that do not have a 
meat ordinance, all kind of meat is dumped into an

23:38.628 --> 23:44.996
area where there is no ordinance prohibiting it. 
And we had to do that. You said that one time you used

23:48.753 --> 23:53.359
a water supply for the city. You had to come from the 
university and from Bryan. Now, do you still, I

23:56.042 --> 24:01.328
guess now, do you have your own wells now or not? We 
do not have our own water supply. At the present

24:03.291 --> 24:08.657
time, we buy both water and electricity from the 
city of Bryan. And, of course, this helps Bryan in

24:10.079 --> 24:14.524
the sense that they generate Well, I guess about 
one third of the revenues that the city of Bryan

24:15.348 --> 24:22.677
generates comes from College Station. And this 
has enabled them to get into the construction

24:23.358 --> 24:41.220
program, like that lake and so on that they have 
there, that new cooling lake, has enabled them to

24:23.358 --> 24:41.220
expand their production for our use as well. Now, 
say the growth back in the 1940s or so of College

24:41.774 --> 24:57.421
Station, was the influx of people into this area, 
was it mostly due to, I guess it was mostly due to the

24:41.774 --> 24:57.421
university being new staff and as the university 
grew, more people came into it. Were there any

24:57.741 --> 24:59.985
other outside businesses or manufacturing 
organizations that the city tried to promote in

25:01.096 --> 25:07.142
this area, College Station, or did they not? Well, 
we did, Jerry. Over the years, what we were trying

25:09.064 --> 25:18.814
to get into College Station, and I would still 
recommend we do, are industries that are

25:09.064 --> 25:18.814
university-oriented. The university has 
facilities out here like the data processing

25:19.675 --> 25:28.504
center and all the expertise in all these areas. 
that could be made available for quality. I know we

25:32.790 --> 25:56.432
worked pretty hard when I was in there to get the 
Banana Institute here at A&M to set up their

25:32.790 --> 25:56.432
primary research facilities in this particular 
university community so that they would have the

25:32.790 --> 25:56.432
benefit of expertise in these various areas, soil 
and water and everything else. for some reason

25:56.750 --> 26:01.835
they did not see fit to come here. But some of the 
universities in the community came for this

26:01.855 --> 26:08.042
particular reason. And this is a type of 
encouragement I have very much discouraged, like

26:08.923 --> 26:25.660
chicken pluckers and things of this nature, 
because not only is it a low scale outfit where they

26:08.923 --> 26:25.660
come into a city, But then it creates a problem like 
for a sewage disposal plant. When you get feathers

26:30.532 --> 26:37.859
and things like this in a sewage disposal system, 
it wrecks it pretty bad. So things like this I had

26:38.379 --> 26:48.969
never encouraged personally.

26:48.989 --> 26:53.773
Now I did, as mayor, I might point this out. give 
every homeowner every year an annual report on the

26:54.850 --> 27:03.300
stewardship of our city. When I went in as mayor, I 
felt this was an obligation on my part to let the

27:03.981 --> 27:18.137
people know about our income and our outgo and what 
we did, what the city employees were doing, things

27:03.981 --> 27:18.137
of this nature. And right after I left, the annual 
report ceased. We have never received a report

27:22.660 --> 27:26.886
from our city government. I deem this very 
unfortunate. Now, if the city has gotten so big

27:28.829 --> 27:49.039
that they feel that they cannot do this in terms of 
an annual report, I do feel that they owe it to the

27:28.829 --> 27:49.039
public through the media of the newspaper or the 
bat, you know, annual report to the citizens on

27:28.829 --> 27:49.039
their stewardship. Now, the cities of San Angelo, 
San Antone, a lot of these cities do this. And I see

27:55.341 --> 28:01.250
no reason why we shouldn't consider or continue to 
do this. But since I left, there's been no annual

28:01.791 --> 28:09.002
report to the citizens on the stewardship of our 
city. I throw this out because I was really sold on

28:09.353 --> 28:17.202
this matter of communicating with the citizens. 
And also in recognizing the bad blood that had been

28:17.222 --> 28:29.375
created earlier between the City of Bryan and 
College Station and the like, I did institute

28:17.222 --> 28:29.375
meetings where we met maybe every three or four 
months. Had a little dinner meeting where we could

28:30.096 --> 28:38.365
discuss what the City of College Station was 
doing, and we had hoped that Bryan would do the same

28:30.096 --> 28:38.365
thing. so as to prevent any future 
misunderstandings or problems that might arise

28:38.851 --> 28:50.890
that each of us, you know, we're not familiar with. 
And as I mentioned earlier, you know, there was

28:50.910 --> 28:59.564
some bad blood originally between the two cities. 
I guess we're almost about out of tape here. I just

29:01.828 --> 29:02.749
wanted to... say thank you and appreciated it and I 
guess that's about all really I just thanks for the

29:03.590 --> 29:31.504
time well Jerry it's been my pleasure I could go on 
for hours beginning in you know each of the areas I

29:03.590 --> 29:31.504
mean public transportation you name it public 
health and I'm just full of it I mean because I have

29:03.590 --> 29:31.504
been involved even this sheet that I have here This 
is one that I, for example, to feel out the public in

29:31.973 --> 29:43.994
terms of every area of growth, expansion, and area 
of activity within the city of College Station. I

29:44.014 --> 29:52.188
sent this out, this is what, about 40 pages, and had 
many citizens review what I consider to be a plan of

29:44.014 --> 29:52.188
action. And they returned it with their critique, 
and this formed the basis of my... tenure in office

29:58.400 --> 30:04.861
and trying to do what was needed in the community. 
So I thank you, Jerry.
