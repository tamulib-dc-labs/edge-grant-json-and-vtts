00:04.705 --> 00:27.945
I would like to see somebody, an anthropologist, 
really look at this influence of how our legal

00:04.705 --> 00:27.945
system, our judiciary system, our legislative 
system, which is totally related to the nature of

00:04.705 --> 00:27.945
the laws, which government is made of laws, not 
men, I take it. but it nevertheless influences men

00:28.448 --> 00:31.473
and their way of thinking. And there's

00:33.516 --> 00:54.810
really a tremendously fundamental 
inconsistency between our system of advocacy and

00:33.516 --> 00:54.810
science, and the manner in which advice,

00:33.516 --> 00:54.810
guidance can be exercised. Of course, other 
political systems, and I'm just guessing it's

00:56.545 --> 01:03.856
Napoleonic ones of that nature, may not be quite so 
constrained. All sides and all doubts and all

01:04.117 --> 01:17.517
questions and all levels of certainty can be 
discussed more freely in a system of that nature,

01:04.117 --> 01:17.517
perhaps.

01:17.537 --> 01:24.628
So you see science as sort of an explosive 
institution where everybody puts in sorts of

01:17.537 --> 01:24.628
ideas and argues and eventually you would affect, 
would you say, calculate risk, like you say the

01:24.895 --> 01:38.579
risk of a nuclear plant is 0.2% in terms of doing 
damage, so you ought to go ahead then and do what's

01:24.895 --> 01:38.579
necessary to develop one? Is that fair to say, that 
sort of open debate? I'm not a bit sure how the

01:42.205 --> 01:46.512
nuclear power plant business has gone, really. I 
think that what has happened is that Many

01:50.697 --> 01:57.605
companies developed nuclear power plants, and 
they were really looking for patentable aspects

01:50.697 --> 01:57.605
of them so that they could have control of them. I 
know General Atomics had some very excellent

01:58.166 --> 02:02.951
parts of their development. Somehow, all of this 
should be put together in the best parts of all of

02:04.814 --> 02:09.039
these put together, you see. But that hasn't 
happened, I believe. So each company has its

02:14.565 --> 02:17.408
weaknesses and its strengths. What we need is the 
most certain sort of a nuclear power plant. But if

02:21.089 --> 02:41.268
you want to talk about certainty and risk,

02:21.089 --> 02:41.268
and I truly believe that if in the brain of the 
archangel that runs this universe, there is some

02:21.089 --> 02:41.268
sort of a curve which says, what are the risks to the 
human race? And the risks to the human race are not

02:42.409 --> 02:50.016
probably the ones we recognize, just exactly like 
the risks in war are very often not the ones we

02:42.409 --> 02:50.016
recognize. And that if one really knew what this 
curve looked like and could make the product of

02:51.548 --> 03:08.969
risks and stakes, or on the positive side, risks 
are possibilities and advantages, it's the rare

02:51.548 --> 03:08.969
ones that are going to count, the very rare ones. 
The fact that we can foresee you might have a

03:09.049 --> 03:13.635
nuclear accident is probably a trivial risk 
anyway. If you multiply the stakes times the risk,

03:14.256 --> 03:19.362
it's a very low number.

03:20.962 --> 03:23.646
On the other hand, there are a great number of other 
things that probably are not so.

03:27.971 --> 03:28.793
Natural events. And I truly think that science's 
role is to explore these more unlikely

03:31.236 --> 03:40.248
possibilities. Let's look at the positive side 
for an instance. There is no science that rules out

03:43.523 --> 03:53.558
the existence of a particle, which is a normal 
particle that has an opposite charge of gravity,

03:43.523 --> 03:53.558
just a negative gravity particle. There's no law 
that rules such a particle out. There is a rule that

03:57.103 --> 04:00.028
says if nothing rules it out, it probably exists. 
What are the possibilities of such a particle

04:01.350 --> 04:05.936
existing and that we could make them? A billion to 
one? Maybe so. But what are the advantages if we

04:09.562 --> 04:11.725
could? Christ, an anti-gravity particle? We'd be 
in real business if it were in normal manner, not

04:15.020 --> 04:19.524
animatic. We'd really be in business, wouldn't 
we? The boon to the world would be absolutely

04:22.948 --> 04:25.851
incredible. The product of possibility and value 
is an immense one, even though it's only a billion

04:25.911 --> 04:32.197
to one or whatever it is. The product is huge. We 
must explore both on the positive side and the

04:35.000 --> 04:40.446
negative side these much more outlandish, outre 
possibilities, it seems to me. And we've got to

04:45.022 --> 05:01.017
think, and the anthropologists also, and the 
historians should really think about what are the

04:45.022 --> 05:01.017
risks and advantages that are critical to the 
survival of this species, which I take it is one of

04:45.022 --> 05:01.017
our principal concerns.
