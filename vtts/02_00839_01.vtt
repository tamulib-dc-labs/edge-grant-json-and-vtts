WEBVTT

00:04.823 --> 00:06.686
But yeah, it's all set. So you were born here in 
Texas, huh? No, no, ma'am. Go ahead. It's fine. I

00:12.756 --> 00:17.363
was born in Victoria, Texas in 1919. You have been 
here a while. At the end of this month. So I'll be 57

00:21.650 --> 00:24.175
years old. And at age one, my family moved back to 
our home the home country of Georgetown, Texas,

00:32.971 --> 00:38.198
which is in Wilson County. Where's that? I mean... 
It's about 30 miles north of Austin. And this

00:43.625 --> 01:02.590
central part of the state is rich in history in that 
the Chisholm Trail and a number of the other cattle

00:43.625 --> 01:02.590
drive routes went through that country 
because... of the formation of the land. If you

01:10.520 --> 01:32.847
follow Highway 81 South in North Texas, say, over 
down to Waco and on down to Georgetown, Austin, San

01:10.520 --> 01:32.847
Marcos, San Antonio, if you'll notice on the west 
side, there's mostly ranching land. It's a pretty

01:33.502 --> 01:46.995
rough country, but right along that edge, there's 
a number of major streams that come off the Cap Rock

01:33.502 --> 01:46.995
in the high country there and go leading on into the 
Gulf. And this is the lower flatlands that run

01:47.015 --> 01:51.479
through there. And there's also that area is 
predominated by the black lands of Central Texas.

02:00.988 --> 02:01.849
Yes, sir. So this was a... A favorite place around 
my hometown in Georgetown was a favorite place by

02:04.180 --> 02:13.393
the Comanche Indians. And as a young person, we 
knew of a campground where they had congregated

02:13.634 --> 02:27.714
and oftentimes went over and waited to find a 
number of artifacts such as their head and things

02:13.634 --> 02:27.714
of this sort. Was it your parents that decided to 
stay here, or did you have earlier ancestors? My

02:33.509 --> 02:43.406
grandmother, my great-grandmother, came to 
Texas right after the Civil War. And she was a crass

02:44.528 --> 02:51.460
widow, referred to in those days. In other words, 
she and her husband had separated, but she had two

02:51.480 --> 02:58.352
young sons that she brought to Central Texas. to 
join a family over there in that area by the name of

02:59.142 --> 03:03.868
Glascott. And incidentally, the city of 
Georgetown is named after my great-great-uncle,

03:04.909 --> 03:15.181
who was a Mr. George Glascott. And back in 1848, 
when the settlers around that part

03:25.079 --> 03:31.208
And at that particular location, decided they 
wanted to build a town, and they needed some land to

03:25.079 --> 03:31.208
do it with. Well, this Mr. George Laskar gave them a 
square mile of land. And he said, the only

03:36.035 --> 03:44.047
requirement is that I'll give you the land 
provided you'll name it Georgetown. But it later

03:44.147 --> 03:46.731
changed to Georgetown. He's the only piece of 
history. Right. And so my family, Mr. Glasscock

03:54.830 --> 04:10.048
and some of the other early settlers there 
received the land grants from not only the Spanish

03:54.830 --> 04:10.048
government, but they also received grants of land 
from the state in its early days. And those lands

04:10.068 --> 04:21.462
were handed down to my grandfather and then to my 
father, who in turn, during the Depression, had

04:10.068 --> 04:21.462
the divest themselves of them because of the, 
well, economic challenges. Yes, sir. Have you

04:29.528 --> 04:32.132
ever moved out of Texas? Have you ever lived 
somewhere else? Yes. I, after graduating from A&M

04:34.015 --> 04:50.858
in 1940, I was commissioned second lieutenant 
infantry, and after nine months of work, I was

04:34.015 --> 04:50.858
called active duty and remained on active duty in 
the armed forces. for 22 years and retired as a

04:52.238 --> 04:56.703
colonel. And you've lived in a lot of different 
places, I'm sure. Yes, it's been my privilege to

04:59.526 --> 05:12.640
serve in several overseas stations, such as 
Korea, Japan, Philippines, Germany, and in a

04:59.526 --> 05:12.640
number of states throughout the nation. My father 
was an Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, and I myself

05:12.660 --> 05:20.288
have lived in the Philippines with him before. 
different places. What part of the Philippines

05:21.609 --> 05:23.872
were you in? Manila. We live in Quezon City. Inside 
a compound, I guess is what you call it. But you

05:30.842 --> 05:32.684
decided to move back here to Texas. Well, of 
course, this was home. The slogan is from Waco.

05:41.697 --> 05:45.863
Most of our families live in the central Texas 
area. So when I retired, I was in Dallas at the time

05:49.597 --> 05:57.629
and was ready to go back to work for some. And right 
after I retired, I was given, made an offer to come

05:57.789 --> 06:06.381
back to Texas A&M University to serve here on the 
staff. And I've been here for 13 years as a member of

06:06.401 --> 06:13.712
the, I'm the director of student financial aid. 
Well, I know where to come. Do you enjoy your work?

06:16.636 --> 06:17.918
Oh, yes, very much. That's good. It's a great 
place. It's a great place to work. Do you have a lot

06:23.041 --> 06:28.189
of relatives that are still living here in Texas? 
No, we don't. Our family consisted primarily of

06:29.811 --> 06:43.752
the

06:29.811 --> 06:43.752
great-grandmothers I referred to earlier, with 
two sons.

06:44.339 --> 06:53.028
And one of the sons moved out into West Texas, and 
that part of the family just completely

06:44.339 --> 06:53.028
disappeared. My grandfather had

06:53.048 --> 07:04.120
three sons, my father and the other son. And they 
all passed on, and so there are some cousins that

07:04.140 --> 07:13.890
live in the area, but not a great number. Yes, sir.

07:18.803 --> 07:22.206
Well, I guess you've enjoyed your life here in 
Texas. If you had a choice, would you live anywhere

07:22.306 --> 07:29.352
else now, or would you stay here, or a different 
part of Texas, maybe? Well, that's hard to say. I

07:32.775 --> 07:41.503
was very fortunate to have grown up in a small town 
like Georgetown, as you probably know. Yes, sir.

07:42.223 --> 07:44.265
The University of Southwestern. This had a vital 
influence on the town. The citizens are made up of a

07:48.695 --> 08:02.072
wide variety of persons of German extraction, 
Swedish, Polish, English, Scotch-Irish, and the

07:48.695 --> 08:02.072
Mexicans and Negroes. And there was a real good mix 
of people there. And it was a fine Christian town to

08:05.156 --> 08:11.805
have the influence of the university. It helped 
the educational processes there. Yes, sir. And

08:15.092 --> 08:26.571
so, but it is not a place where you could make a 
fortune for a state. You say you lived in

08:26.591 --> 08:30.497
Georgetown and then here and in Dallas. Was there 
anywhere else that you lived since you were in

08:30.537 --> 08:33.302
Texas? In Texas? Well, I worked in Waco for a while. 
And at one time during my career videos, I was a

08:38.313 --> 08:48.605
professor of military science in Texas. And those 
are the only places that, well, after Mrs. Logan

08:48.625 --> 08:59.317
and I first married, we lived in Galveston for 
about 18 months. And for that, while we were going

08:59.337 --> 09:05.163
out into other states and overseas. What part of 
Texas did you enjoy the most, and maybe there's

09:07.338 --> 09:18.029
another part that you haven't lived yet that you 
thought would be more enjoyable in the way of maybe

09:07.338 --> 09:18.029
geography or, you know, different parts of it that 
you might like to live there. Oh, I don't know. I

09:21.333 --> 09:26.799
think this area is just about as good a living area 
as you can find.

09:30.102 --> 09:33.146
There's a good thing for each place. Good thing to 
be said. I do not like... I

09:36.970 --> 09:58.153
guess

09:36.970 --> 09:58.153
it has. That's a very good topic. What kind of 
changes have you noticed since you first moved

10:01.236 --> 10:06.522
here? when you were a cadet here to now in this area? 
Well, when I was a cadet here, my senior year, we

10:10.614 --> 10:18.964
moved into the cadet dormitory. That was the first 
year in 1939, the first year that area was

10:18.984 --> 10:24.250
occupied. And that was what got us named the new 
dormitory. And so we moved in there. And we...

10:35.527 --> 10:39.252
where Mosier and Kruger and Dunn and so forth 
buried. You notice there's a horse barn there?

10:41.394 --> 10:41.815
Yes, sir. There was all this area to the south and 
east was cattle and horses and things of this sort.

10:51.186 --> 11:02.019
And in the cadet corps, when we had field problems, 
we would start our field problem exercises,

10:51.186 --> 11:02.019
company platoon, battalion-sized field 
exercise. We would have our starting point. over

11:03.843 --> 11:19.597
where College View is now and come across that open 
grass area where the photo team practices and

11:03.843 --> 11:19.597
people get out and get golf shots and go on across

11:03.843 --> 11:19.597
what's now the golf course. And this high point 
over here where we're sitting tonight in this

11:19.777 --> 11:27.924
wooded area was the enemy objective. And this is 
where you'd wind up your exploration. The

11:34.083 --> 11:44.654
movement of the front gate to the east side of the 
campus occurred about two years before 1936. Most

11:44.674 --> 11:51.380
of the traffic that came to the campus came by way of 
Westgate. And, of course, the railroad there and

11:52.381 --> 11:57.947
the railroad station were a focal point of 
interest. You said, sir, that you were In the class

12:00.830 --> 12:04.215
of 39, there was a veterinarian back in my 
hometown. I don't know his first name. I know his

12:05.977 --> 12:07.319
name was Dr. Davis. He was kind of a well-built man 
in the way that he was pretty big. And then there's

12:15.370 --> 12:19.976
another guy named Robert Cherry, who was the mayor 
of my hometown. Do you remember those guys? I

12:22.320 --> 12:23.181
remember Davis. Now, my class is 40. Of course, I 
regularly live in 40. In our senior year, the first

12:29.602 --> 12:36.032
was the fall semester, wasn't it? I graduated in 
40, but I remember Davis. Terry, I don't place

12:40.359 --> 12:44.125
right offhand, but I may. If you have your old 
yearbook, you might be able to look him up. He's

12:47.751 --> 12:50.214
about 6'1". He's a well-built man. He runs the main 
laundry back in my hometown in Jamaica. Well, you

12:57.547 --> 13:03.215
said that the traffic was changed to the east side 
about two years before you got here. How about the

13:03.235 --> 13:07.442
town here, Brian, College Station? College 
Station here and there? College Station, there

13:09.545 --> 13:15.093
was about three stores up there where Northgate is 
now. It was down by the railroad, where the

13:15.534 --> 13:21.382
railroad underpass is. Of course, now there was no 
underpass. There was just a the road just went up

13:26.302 --> 13:53.693
over the railroad and it's pretty rough crossing 
but on that corner was the gulf swimming station

13:26.302 --> 13:53.693
the principal garage and swimming station up 
above was a couple of grocery stores and and then

13:26.302 --> 13:53.693
the rest of it just uh warmly and there were a few few 
uh stores over around east gate a couple of there

13:26.302 --> 13:53.693
but uh that was the extent of it and uh Actually 
there was a grocery store on campus, there was a

13:54.213 --> 14:11.422
barber shop, there was the soda fountain right 
there in the YMCA building, and there was a bowling

13:54.213 --> 14:11.422
alley and swimming pool in that area. And so the 
laundry was here. As I say, there was one garage,

14:17.787 --> 14:20.431
and that was it. That's for both towns? That was for 
college patients. How about Bryan? Now, Bryan

14:25.358 --> 14:35.452
was... Bryan started about where...

14:25.358 --> 14:35.452
Now, let's see. Let's do landmark.

14:40.859 --> 14:42.141
You know where...

14:45.665 --> 14:50.431
where the Shamrock Station is on South College, 
that Y there. Brian just about began there and went

14:51.031 --> 14:59.622
on into the main part, the business part of Brian, 
was down on Main Street. And there used to be buses

14:59.702 --> 15:03.587
that you could ride. I missed the trolley. I didn't 
get to ride the trolley, but there were buses, and

15:05.629 --> 15:11.536
went back into it. So there was kind of a... A 
difference between the cities back then? Oh,

15:15.195 --> 15:15.755
yeah. Well, it was a distinct area. In fact, there 
was quite a few good farms right in there. Was that

15:27.431 --> 15:29.374
kind of the place to go? Was there something to do in 
Bryan? Oh, there was a couple of eating places

15:31.897 --> 15:41.811
downtown where you'd go down and you had money to 
purge and what have you. Dominic's had a pretty

15:42.753 --> 15:46.417
good looking waitress. I guess there just weren't 
that many girls at all back then anyway. No, there

15:51.102 --> 16:06.760
were, but the only young ladies that were on campus 
were the professors' daughters and those who,

15:51.102 --> 16:06.760
daughters of the military people. Now, of course, 
the professors and the military staff all lived on

16:06.820 --> 16:11.325
campus at the time. In fact, Dean's Row was right 
there where the MSC is. And there was a number of

16:16.390 --> 16:24.321
large homes there on that street that just faced 
the drill field where the MSC is. And this was where

16:25.122 --> 16:38.342
we deemed the college, Dean Kyle, Dean Gilchrist, 
and Dean

16:25.122 --> 16:38.342
Gustafson, and then There were several others, 
and where the trigon is now was where the confidant

16:39.740 --> 16:46.769
song was. There was a large phone there, and John 
Moore had received a lot of attention because he

16:46.789 --> 16:59.304
had a very pretty view of the development of 
Francis. So then you moved away from here. in uh

17:01.660 --> 17:30.233
what 41 40 40. i lived here in 40 and we went off to the 
service i went to well i went to work in waco and i was

17:01.660 --> 17:30.233
there for nine months and then i called active duty 
went from there to galveston served in galveston

17:01.660 --> 17:30.233
for about two years and then was transferred up to 
north carolina Georgia, and then overseas. And

17:34.613 --> 17:48.049
then finally wound up in Japan and stayed there for 
almost three years before he came back and was

17:34.613 --> 17:48.049
stationed in New York City. And then back to 
Georgia, and then to Germany, and then to

17:48.529 --> 17:53.675
Stephenville, Texas. To Stephenville. Then when 
was the, you moved back here 13 years ago, is that

17:55.678 --> 17:59.983
what you said? What kind of, uh, did you visited a in 
between the time you were back to Stephenville? I

18:08.688 --> 18:22.262
had been here one, one

18:08.688 --> 18:22.262
time when I was a military staff at Carlton State 
College. Why? There wasn't a meeting here and we

18:22.582 --> 18:28.148
came down and attended a Okay,

18:28.803 --> 18:39.275
now that was after the time you returned to 
Stephenville? Okay, so when you moved back here,

18:39.475 --> 18:44.881
then you should have noticed the big change. What 
was your first impression when you came back here?

18:50.348 --> 18:56.835
Well, the biggest change, of course, that I 
noticed was that The Coke building was new. There

19:00.823 --> 19:01.985
was no such thing as that. There were several of the 
older buildings that were gone. The MSC was new, or

19:10.358 --> 19:16.247
had been built since I was here. And G. Riley White 
had been put in. There had been some change to Kyle

19:18.610 --> 19:21.755
Field. There were several dorms that had been 
built over in the Salugan dorm there in the south.

19:27.342 --> 19:29.365
Northwest Department. I didn't know that it was 
that first year that they let the civilians in. I

19:34.211 --> 19:36.093
thought it was 64. Actually, military science was 
first declared non-compulsory in about 1954, the

19:38.556 --> 19:50.631
first time. And it was for about three years it was 
not compulsory in there. You didn't have to be in

19:54.997 --> 19:56.218
the Corps. But then they were in the board of 
directors reinstated again. I don't remember how

19:59.810 --> 20:01.872
long it was. But now when I came back here in 63, the 
court was not compulsion.

20:13.125 --> 20:17.690
There was a size and no large number of students. Of 
course, in my day, there was a lot of students that

20:17.710 --> 20:21.615
were not in the core really. They wore the uniform, 
but they were not known as the Corps of Cadets. They

20:26.041 --> 20:29.324
lived in the Corps because there was no place else 
to go. Oh, I see. They were called non-regs in our

20:30.446 --> 20:33.128
day. Oh, and then we turn the term over to all 
civilian students on campus now. I refer to you as

20:38.373 --> 20:41.997
non-regs by the people in the Corps. When you came 
back here, was all the farmland between College

20:42.217 --> 20:48.323
Station and Bryan now pretty much gone? Yes, it was 
pretty well gone. There had been... A lot of

20:53.101 --> 21:00.910
building take place in between here and Bryant, 
even in that short period of time. There's been

21:01.551 --> 21:05.835
quite a few additions. Of course, this area out 
south of here, when we first moved in here, there

21:05.855 --> 21:15.506
was only houses about three blocks south of us. In 
that time, it's gone all the way past the west

21:16.487 --> 21:20.492
bypass How about,

21:21.130 --> 21:31.685
you know, I noticed downtown Bryan is just kind of 
unique all by itself. It's kind of an old addition

21:31.745 --> 21:37.514
now back on the, uh, about two streets off from now, 
the main street, I guess. And then you have all the

21:38.215 --> 21:42.822
new, you know, everything, Denny's and things 
down on the other street. Was that, uh, was that

21:43.362 --> 21:48.690
about the way it was when you were here in 63 or was 
it, uh, The main street's still over there where

21:49.227 --> 21:52.730
all the old buildings were. At that time, the only 
major shopping center outside of downtown Bryan

21:53.130 --> 22:08.183
was the

21:53.130 --> 22:08.183
Manor East

21:53.130 --> 22:08.183
Shopping Center. What was that? No, not Manor 
East. What is the one where it's here? Townshire.

22:11.726 --> 22:18.492
Townshire was the only other major shopping 
center, and it had become very... widely used. But

22:21.503 --> 22:27.831
still, many of you have to go to downtown Bryan at 
that time. There were more stores along North Gate

22:28.052 --> 22:30.695
over here. And

22:31.817 --> 22:38.065
the Redmond Cherry Shopping Center had just been 
built. It was new and just getting started. Yes.

22:41.569 --> 22:47.297
One of the things that my teacher has noticed about 
people that are now living in Texas is that it seems

22:48.003 --> 22:53.391
like a lot of them were born here, moved away, and 
then returned here to retire. And one of the

22:54.192 --> 23:08.813
questions she was asking us was to find out if the 
people we were interviewing would know any

22:54.192 --> 23:08.813
friends of theirs that would say moved away and 
moved back, and why this syndrome is for the people

22:54.192 --> 23:08.813
to move back to Texas to retire. Is there something 
about it just being home? Because there's a lot of

23:11.617 --> 23:17.065
other states that aren't known as home states, 
like maybe somewhere like maybe California

23:17.652 --> 23:24.121
people might be born in California and then not 
really move back there too much, live in other

23:17.652 --> 23:24.121
places. Well, if you've ever lived in other 
places, I think that's a good reason to come back.

23:31.651 --> 23:46.731
There are some places like, oh, there's some 
beautiful places in Georgia and Oregon and

23:31.651 --> 23:46.731
Washington State that we seriously consider, 
particularly in Washington, Oregon, I seriously

23:46.930 --> 23:51.957
consider moving to a retirement place. Was that up 
in the mountains? No, it's along the seacoast.

23:58.507 --> 24:00.730
And it's fine climate and so on. But I think one of 
the reasons is Texans are family oriented. And the

24:07.379 --> 24:10.744
family still means a lot to many of us. My mother was 
born here. So we came back primarily with the idea

24:14.538 --> 24:31.062
that we had four children, and we wanted our 
children to know their grandparents, know their

24:14.538 --> 24:31.062
cousins, and the rest of the family, you see. So we 
moved back into Texas. Well, the Army was good to

24:34.948 --> 24:38.453
us. Unfortunately, due to the assignment in my 
last four years, I was assigned to headquarters in

24:38.905 --> 24:50.075
Pentagon, Washington, but my duty station is in 
Dallas, Texas. Oh, I see. So when we got ready to

24:50.375 --> 24:59.844
retire, we were already located in the area that we 
were going to stay here. My mother was born in

25:00.064 --> 25:02.866
Denison, Texas. That's where I'm from. I don't 
know if you know where that is. All her family was

25:07.627 --> 25:12.914
born in Denison or in eastern Texas where the pine 
trees are. And everybody is always in touch, you

25:13.775 --> 25:17.981
know, pretty much still. And even when the third or 
fourth cousin of somebody dies, there's a big

25:18.702 --> 25:29.057
funeral and everybody goes down to it and still 
gets together for reunions down there. Well, my

25:29.077 --> 25:36.587
father, his family live in southern Alabama in the 
German community because my last name is

25:29.077 --> 25:36.587
Dornstotter. I hadn't realized you might be a good 
infection. Oh, yeah. Actually, it's a

25:41.029 --> 25:42.930
Dornstatter. Yeah. And they don't get together 
too much. They know pretty much who's alive and

25:47.835 --> 25:50.598
who's not, but that's about it. But I did notice 
that Texas was a big family community type thing.

25:56.523 --> 26:05.171
People, even if their cousins live all over the 
city, they still know pretty much where everybody

25:56.523 --> 26:05.171
is and keep in touch. Well, they... Like Mrs. 
Logan's family, their name, they're scholars in

26:06.065 --> 26:12.371
Swiss German, German-Swiss. They always have a 
family union on Labor Day, and they're quite a

26:13.472 --> 26:20.519
large family. There's about 70 or 80 people that 
congregate, and it's quite a time. I mean, even

26:24.183 --> 26:29.128
outsiders like me, I know everybody. And this, I 
think, is one of the reasons that people come back

26:29.688 --> 26:34.213
to Texas. And there's...

26:39.207 --> 26:52.301
There is an honesty and an openness and a 
friendliness about people from Texas that I don't

26:39.207 --> 26:52.301
think we find in a lot of other places. You haven't 
lived around the world,

26:52.682 --> 26:59.509
too. It's something that we gained, I think, from a 
heritage from our forefathers who established

26:59.529 --> 27:09.180
this country. personally a lot to do with it is 
there are many states that have the same type of

27:09.413 --> 27:38.256
area for the whole state because they're not very 
big, like in the New England countries, but in this

27:09.413 --> 27:38.256
state you can, as a resident, you can go from 
mountains to, you know, up in Dalhart where it

27:09.413 --> 27:38.256
snows all the time to, say, Galveston in South 
Texas, and you can go to about anywhere and find

27:09.413 --> 27:38.256
your type of climate that you pretty much want, 
except for maybe like an area like Oregon or

27:09.413 --> 27:38.256
Washington where the they have a rough cold 
climate and the storms that are always coming

27:38.675 --> 27:44.083
through and things like that. Well, it's the 
course of climate we deal with. You have enough

27:47.027 --> 27:57.243
change in the seasons that it doesn't become very 
monotonous like you find out in Hawaii and other

27:47.027 --> 27:57.243
places like that. So the climate, there is a lot of 
opportunity here in the state. And then again, the

28:04.373 --> 28:07.618
family ties, I think, And there's a feeling not 
only among Aggies, but also among Texans that,

28:08.020 --> 28:19.273
well, it's Texans against the world, so to speak. 
Yeah, that was another big subject brought out

28:19.293 --> 28:29.204
where there's more of a unity here in Texas about us 
being Texans, that we relate to that all over.

28:29.264 --> 28:32.127
People from California can do it a bit. People from 
Alaska can do it some, and then maybe some people

28:32.668 --> 28:37.133
from Florida. But here in Texas, it's just kind of 
the Alamo and, you know, everything that we're

28:37.484 --> 28:45.292
Texas and to hell with everybody else sometimes, 
you know. Oklahoma does that some, too. Oh, yeah.

28:51.137 --> 28:52.579
We've got them pretty well trained. We've had them 
for actually a quarter of a year, so we've not

28:52.599 --> 28:56.042
gotten good. Yeah. Well, the tape is just about 
over. Is there anything you'd like to say that any

29:00.747 --> 29:05.331
impressions that have been made here uh on by texas 
on you anything that you remember more than

29:05.581 --> 29:17.363
anything else no i don't i don't know of anything 
And, you know, if you'd like to make any particular

29:19.047 --> 29:36.514
comment about it, as I say, I think it's a great 
place to hear that I'm fortunate in having my early

29:19.047 --> 29:36.514
life here. I've been very fortunate in being able 
to serve my country in many places and in many fine

29:36.534 --> 29:40.600
assignments. have the opportunity to come back 
and come to a place like Connors Place and touch in

29:40.580 --> 29:51.422
with some of the local, with young people, the way 
it's going to back on in. So you're going to be

29:51.443 --> 29:53.607
welcome. And in the past, I don't believe it's been 
much better.
