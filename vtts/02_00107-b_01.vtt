WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:05.934
Attitudes and feelings as you're going out in the real world.

00:06.855 --> 00:09.137
What was the pay at that first job?

00:09.157 --> 00:11.019
365 a month.

00:11.059 --> 00:11.760
365 a month.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.629
Dad was making 360 a month at Sinclair and had been working there 25 years, 30 years at that time.

00:19.649 --> 00:19.989
365.

00:21.111 --> 00:29.340
And do you remember the kind of interview questions and so forth you were asked?

00:29.360 --> 00:30.561
Was it a very long

00:31.267 --> 00:33.491
I think mine was most unusual.

00:33.852 --> 00:34.974
I don't know why I did that.

00:34.994 --> 00:37.118
I don't know where I got the confidence to do it or not.

00:37.158 --> 00:40.084
But I just said, I want to work for GE, the best company.

00:40.765 --> 00:42.509
And at the time, they were the best company.

00:42.549 --> 00:46.717
They still are the best company, in my opinion, in a lot of things.

00:46.797 --> 00:52.227
But what they did, what they designed and developed was really quality items.

00:52.347 --> 00:53.730
So I really knew that.

00:54.537 --> 01:00.625
and so I got to work with them for more or less 10 years and yes they did quality work.

01:00.945 --> 01:10.778
Were there some key people at A&M as you were getting ready to leave that you wanted to thank for what if you could have that would that made a difference for you?

01:14.362 --> 01:15.464
Crawford maybe.

01:16.906 --> 01:21.051
I had a tough time and I think in those days

01:21.436 --> 01:26.183
It was kind of pontifical that the profs were.

01:26.203 --> 01:29.908
They weren't quite as friendly as I thought.

01:32.191 --> 01:33.573
But it's not that they weren't friendly.

01:33.593 --> 01:34.835
I didn't have a chance to know them.

01:35.416 --> 01:37.699
There wasn't any reason to, you know.

01:39.522 --> 01:43.808
And I think that after that, I know when I came back, I said I was going to be available for the kids.

01:44.749 --> 01:47.693
I was going to.

01:48.414 --> 01:51.038
Do you remember what your undergraduate GPA was?

01:52.537 --> 01:52.757
1.87.

01:53.398 --> 01:56.983
No, 000 under the old.

01:57.003 --> 01:58.125
That'd make it about 287.

01:58.245 --> 02:00.568
Yeah, under the old three-point system.

02:02.591 --> 02:02.751
Yeah.

02:02.832 --> 02:04.113
And I tell you, I was fortunate.

02:04.694 --> 02:11.424
You just don't know how tough it was for me about not being very smart maybe and worrying about money all the time.

02:11.484 --> 02:17.953
Then the folks were going to break up and, you know, there's a lot of stress kids have that we as profs overlook sometimes.

02:18.254 --> 02:27.565
What were, as you, during that 10 years, what were the key courses that you realized they were the key courses?

02:28.886 --> 02:32.410
Well, it's kind of the courses that I ended up teaching here.

02:32.611 --> 02:38.798
One is the how to develop production standards to increase efficiency.

02:39.498 --> 02:40.179
That was a course.

02:40.299 --> 02:44.925
Another one is how to lay out a factory for smooth material flow through the factory.

02:46.026 --> 02:47.788
The math courses are never used.

02:51.329 --> 03:08.309
English of course always shortening I mean everybody can always be better in English whether you're an engineer or English major so I could always been better in that but I tell you I felt real good about it and then the company knew about what we could do so they didn't you know try to.

03:10.031 --> 03:16.459
What as you look back on those ten years of experience what

03:17.705 --> 03:26.276
did the curriculum then include more of than you needed and less of that you needed?

03:30.422 --> 03:34.667
Well, I think, I do know that we had more labs in those days.

03:35.128 --> 03:36.469
We had about seven labs.

03:36.930 --> 03:37.411
Was that good?

03:37.951 --> 03:39.153
In my opinion, it was superb.

03:39.173 --> 03:43.138
I still remember what we did in the lab, not too much what we did in the course sometime.

03:43.743 --> 03:50.534
But, of course, now we've cut out, dropped about five labs because labs are very expensive, take a lot of time, and nobody wants to teach them.

03:51.495 --> 03:53.819
But, yeah, I like the labs.

03:53.899 --> 03:59.548
And we had one course in statistics, and statistics was just coming into being.

04:00.190 --> 04:03.094
And so I think we should have had another course in that.

04:05.198 --> 04:11.067
Math, like I say, we had several calculus, but we didn't use, didn't have differential equations or linear algebra.

04:11.688 --> 04:13.531
And in those days, you didn't use that.

04:13.591 --> 04:14.632
You're more of a worker.

04:15.414 --> 04:17.577
Kind of like the Japanese engineer of today.

04:18.739 --> 04:24.267
They can put it together or calculate it and that's the way we used to be more putting it together, I think.

04:25.108 --> 04:28.453
When did you get, make my mind think of slide roof?

04:28.473 --> 04:30.937
When did you buy your first slide roof?

04:30.957 --> 04:32.759
Well, must have been in high school.

04:32.900 --> 04:38.488
I got a little one in high school but I remember at A&M, I went over and got a, when I was here the first week, got me a,

04:39.008 --> 04:42.152
whatever 12 inch in a leather case you know that you hang on your belt.

04:43.433 --> 04:45.376
Did you wear that almost every day?

04:46.016 --> 04:51.844
No I carried it no I didn't wear it I thought it was silly to wear it you know it looked a little bit geekish I guess.

04:52.304 --> 05:00.033
Did you take that slide rule on with you into the engineering world when you left campus?

05:00.354 --> 05:03.818
Well actually when I got in the engineering world we had we had some

05:04.203 --> 05:06.286
assistant, engineering assistants.

05:06.687 --> 05:08.510
They were usually girls with math majors.

05:08.970 --> 05:09.071
Okay.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.232
And they had a two-foot loan.

05:10.272 --> 05:13.117
They worked with two-foot slide rules.

05:13.197 --> 05:15.360
Okay.

05:15.380 --> 05:16.222
So, yeah, I took it with me.

05:16.302 --> 05:20.929
But, you know, I remember here when it changed, the first Hewlett-Packard came out, it was really something.

05:21.280 --> 05:25.826
400 and something dollars and could do three or four things.

05:26.167 --> 05:35.620
Now take the story of your life then from graduation until you came back as a faculty member.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.184
Yeah, I, graduation.

05:38.785 --> 05:41.569
When I left here I went, I got on an engineering training program.

05:41.589 --> 05:43.051
That's what was so good about GE.

05:43.592 --> 05:49.600
I spent three months in Philadelphia on switchgear then I spent

05:51.200 --> 06:06.867
until April, December to April on jet engines in Cincinnati and then went to the service for three years and I went in flying and I got to fly a lot of different airplanes for the three-year time period.

06:06.887 --> 06:13.358
Then I came out and went to Boston and worked on jet engines and went to Tyler and worked on air conditioning.

06:13.739 --> 06:14.340
Still with GE?

06:14.601 --> 06:15.402
Still with GE.

06:15.972 --> 06:24.807
At that time I met Jeanette, I met the wife, and we both, she was the secretary there at GE and Tyler, and we both moved back for two years to Cincinnati.

06:25.648 --> 06:38.149
And then we left Cincinnati, came back to Tyler, and the reason I'm here is they moved my desk, and they said, now, this Friday we're moving your desk to Louisville, just don't take anything out of it.

06:38.551 --> 06:40.614
We're going to move it up there and we'll see you up there Monday.

06:40.654 --> 06:41.536
And I said, no way.

06:42.056 --> 06:47.224
So I taught, had a friend that was, well, our Sunday school teacher.

06:47.284 --> 06:48.005
He was a principal.

06:48.026 --> 06:55.557
So I taught two years at junior high and came up to A&M and just said, well, I'll just, what I did, I brought my ninth graders up.

06:55.597 --> 06:58.882
I got about nine ninth graders, boys that were pretty sharp.

06:59.363 --> 07:01.126
And we came up here for a weekend.

07:01.787 --> 07:05.993
And I went over to the department and I said, why don't you just take a course?

07:06.513 --> 07:06.994
Okay.

07:07.654 --> 07:09.196
Then why don't you just take another course?

07:09.356 --> 07:09.677
Okay.

07:10.477 --> 07:13.040
So it just stayed here and kept taking courses.

07:13.140 --> 07:14.722
Now that's in the mid-60s.

07:15.163 --> 07:16.284
Yeah.

07:16.985 --> 07:25.594
We got here in 66 and built a lab and got a master's in 67 and got a PhD in 70.

07:25.614 --> 07:26.756
All right.

07:26.776 --> 07:31.841
When did you become a full-time faculty member?

07:31.861 --> 07:35.085
I got tenure pretty quick in about two years.

07:35.707 --> 07:41.055
must have been about 72, as an assistant professor.

07:41.676 --> 07:43.238
And that was the Department of?

07:43.278 --> 07:44.400
Industrial Engineering.

07:44.580 --> 07:47.444
Describe it at the time you joined.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.447
How big was the department?

07:49.467 --> 07:49.908
Oh, yeah.

07:51.270 --> 07:58.440
We had about six profs.

07:59.551 --> 08:05.498
And we had about 100 graduate students because we were doing a lot of military training for the Air Force and so forth.

08:06.519 --> 08:12.385
And maybe 180 undergraduates, something like that.

08:12.405 --> 08:13.687
And so we started growing.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.609
We collected some, grew a little bit.

08:16.130 --> 08:18.973
Then no one wanted to use, no one wanted a computer.

08:18.993 --> 08:21.776
When that came on campus, they couldn't find anybody interested in it.

08:22.176 --> 08:25.340
But old Burgess said, you know, we might be able to use that thing somehow.

08:25.981 --> 08:28.123
So they started teaching computer courses.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.884
And the graduate students were both computer and I.E.

08:30.924 --> 08:36.409
And then computing science got up to 2,500 students and they broke off and made another department.

08:37.030 --> 08:37.651
So I.E.

08:37.671 --> 08:41.574
was kind of nurtured that from very, very beginning.

08:42.135 --> 08:44.297
It was so funny no one wanted to fool with that thing.

08:44.997 --> 08:50.763
Where was, as far as you know, where was the first computer on the campus physically located?

08:52.484 --> 08:56.288
When I was here in 53 I worked on an analog computer it was called.

08:56.639 --> 09:01.047
In the EE department, Dr. Hap ran that.

09:01.067 --> 09:03.372
So I worked on that one summer for a few hours.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.416
It must have been 54.

09:05.576 --> 09:07.399
Was it using key punch cards?

09:07.419 --> 09:10.986
No, no, this was using rheostats and...

09:11.557 --> 09:14.782
generators and tubes.

09:15.723 --> 09:24.796
And then the first one that I remember was 1401 over in the data center you had to hand wire it.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.040
That was about in 66.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.987
All right now that's a building attached to what is now Teague Hall.

09:32.047 --> 09:32.307
Right.

09:32.728 --> 09:33.469
The Teague building.

09:33.569 --> 09:34.270
Right.

09:34.330 --> 09:35.392
The data processing center.

09:35.572 --> 09:36.293
Center, right.

09:37.014 --> 09:38.256
And that was an IBM?

09:38.523 --> 09:39.504
IBM 1401.

09:41.846 --> 09:47.492
You had a bunch of boards, big boards, and you plug wires in them, then you slide the board in to do your task.

09:48.072 --> 09:51.235
4K memory for the whole thing, 4 is nothing.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.396
You know what I mean?

09:52.857 --> 09:54.118
Gee, but in those days it was.

09:55.179 --> 10:00.945
And then we got the IBM 3 something, 160, I don't remember.

10:02.826 --> 10:04.248
It was IBM 95 or something.

10:04.268 --> 10:05.509
Then we got the 360.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.473
Who was the, when you joined the department, who was the department head?

10:10.475 --> 10:12.980
Bill Wortham, Dr. Wortham was the department head.

10:14.283 --> 10:20.014
And Burgess was going over to University of Texas at the time to get his doctorate, which he did.

10:20.855 --> 10:23.380
And y'all were quartered located where?

10:25.115 --> 10:34.106
And the old engineering building, which is near the library, which is, I don't know what's, ocean, no, archeology's in there now, I think.

10:34.987 --> 10:40.373
Nautical or, nautical archeology is what it is.

10:40.493 --> 10:43.637
Okay, they're in that building.

10:43.657 --> 10:48.843
And who were the other key members of the department in those, in this?

10:49.164 --> 10:49.264
Yeah.

10:49.284 --> 10:51.206
In those years, late 60s, early 70s.

10:51.306 --> 10:53.529
Yeah.

10:53.629 --> 10:54.430
Wilbur Meyer.

10:55.456 --> 10:57.479
who went on with the National Science Foundation.

10:57.519 --> 10:59.823
He's gone to a lot of different places.

11:02.287 --> 11:07.335
Captain Carlson was a labor relations man.

11:08.116 --> 11:09.078
He was real good.

11:09.639 --> 11:16.249
Covan was the time standards man and layout man, Jack Covan.

11:16.690 --> 11:18.292
Jack Covan died of a heart attack.

11:19.054 --> 11:19.695
Didn't see that.

11:19.835 --> 11:21.177
Got to meet his sons.

11:21.494 --> 11:24.719
Burgess died, I was up there in the hospital when he died with liver cancer.

11:25.760 --> 11:31.028
Wortham had a heart attack and just, just, just died about three years ago.

11:41.022 --> 11:44.768
Well I can't think and Burgess, I mean and Benson was the dean.

11:45.369 --> 11:47.452
I'm trying to think of one other guy I can't.

11:47.472 --> 11:49.855
Let's talk about Fred Benson.

11:49.915 --> 11:51.197
Describe your

11:51.683 --> 11:57.669
your feeling about your impressions, your evaluation of him as a dean of engineering?

11:57.689 --> 12:00.051
Gosh, there'll never be another one like him.

12:01.112 --> 12:10.962
Solid, honest, hard-working, didn't put up with any trivia, but was fair and thoughtful and so forth.

12:10.982 --> 12:19.851
So Benson, of course, I kind of knew him from, I know one day he called me in when I was working here and said he would like to know if we could

12:20.135 --> 12:30.509
What I know about a dynamometer, it seemed like Ferrari gave him a couple cars or something and so he wanted to get a chassis dynamometer which is some rollers.

12:30.549 --> 12:38.019
You push the car on the rollers and start it up and the back wheels make the rollers go and then you can check the gasoline consumption and so on and so on.

12:39.962 --> 12:47.712
I remember he did call me for a little project like that so I got the manufacturers in because I knew if he wanted a chassis dynamometer

12:48.772 --> 12:56.162
Anyway, so he got, I just had all the people, I did a big report for him and he thanked me for it.

12:56.263 --> 12:57.825
I was on the side, you might say.

12:59.207 --> 13:07.679
How did he react to someone having a contrary, an opinion contrary to his?

13:09.201 --> 13:12.265
There wasn't any opinion contrary, no.

13:13.628 --> 13:18.939
I really believe he had listened but once he decided that that was the way to go he would do it.

13:20.041 --> 13:24.410
And wouldn't look back and say that's the way it is.

13:24.711 --> 13:26.415
Did he carry grudges?

13:29.040 --> 13:31.365
You know he could have but I don't remember and I don't think so.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.409
Just his appearance.

13:33.828 --> 13:37.513
He wouldn't, but if you screwed up, if you fouled up, he would remember that, I think.

13:38.014 --> 13:39.717
I don't know if you call that a grudge or not.

13:40.298 --> 13:42.521
I don't think he was a grudge killer at all.

13:42.541 --> 13:44.864
I think he listened and then made a decision.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.567
And then stuck with it.

13:47.068 --> 13:51.694
And a lot of people, our big problem that we were having over, no, it's not a story.

13:52.896 --> 13:56.862
It's unusual to find a guy like that nowadays who you can trust, and you can trust it.

13:56.902 --> 13:59.987
When he said, it's green, man, you can trust it's green.

14:00.648 --> 14:02.991
And a lot of people...

14:03.494 --> 14:11.262
Kind of came, one of our assistant departments came to me once and said, you know what you've got to do is do what makes you look good.

14:12.183 --> 14:16.248
And I said, no, I'm going to do what's right in my opinion.

14:16.268 --> 14:17.849
So I've always been that way, Haskell.

14:18.310 --> 14:22.034
Part of it, I think I'm an engineer and I think that I've calculated out.

14:22.094 --> 14:22.975
You want my opinion?

14:23.756 --> 14:26.018
I'll give you my opinion based on what I know.

14:26.659 --> 14:29.562
And then once you make a decision, you know, I'll go along with it.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.505
But, yeah, I thought, I thought,

14:33.532 --> 14:37.076
The dean was always in big meetings, all the meetings, he'd be real.

14:38.418 --> 14:39.959
I did like him jingling his coin.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.484
Every time he stood up and talked, he had about $3 worth of coins in his pocket.

14:44.965 --> 14:48.289
He'd jingle those, and I don't know if he ever knew that or not.

14:48.309 --> 14:53.034
Did you and the other faculty members have the impression that he was a hard worker?

14:53.054 --> 14:55.797
Yeah, yeah.

14:55.817 --> 14:56.798
But he wasn't ridiculous.

14:56.818 --> 15:00.923
You know, we had one guy that wanted to prove he was a hard worker, so he stayed there all the time.

15:01.342 --> 15:05.109
And then we found out he just parked his car there and turned the lights on and snuck out.

15:05.830 --> 15:07.713
Yeah, Benson was honest and straightforward.

15:07.733 --> 15:12.822
How long did it take to get a, what was the turnaround time on the answer from Benson?

15:13.543 --> 15:20.355
Oh, it really depends on what you're talking about, but it's pretty short.

15:22.038 --> 15:24.362
But I think on the answer to what

15:24.595 --> 15:25.837
dynamometer was going to buy.

15:25.957 --> 15:29.643
He had to get some more time and look at the prices, have the guys come in again.

15:31.366 --> 15:33.630
You got here when Mr. Rutter was still president.

15:33.650 --> 15:35.113
Yes, 66.

15:35.213 --> 15:38.538
What did you all think about Mr. Rutter as president?

15:38.558 --> 15:42.826
Well, you know, the wife worked for him for a while, but, and I didn't, she'd never told me any.

15:43.086 --> 15:45.069
But you and your family.

15:45.089 --> 15:46.131
Well, I liked him.

15:46.550 --> 15:51.916
He was a strong conservative military guy that didn't seem to put up with anything.

15:52.897 --> 15:57.803
When we had people step that he thought stepped out of line, he let them know about him.

15:58.964 --> 16:01.948
And I felt we had a strong leader at the time.

16:03.009 --> 16:05.171
Of course, didn't get to know him too well either, but.

16:06.473 --> 16:11.138
Did you ever hear him make any speeches to the faculty or anything?

16:11.238 --> 16:12.139
I don't remember, no.

16:13.821 --> 16:14.582
I'm sure I did.

16:15.322 --> 16:21.290
In fact, I didn't even remember that you're the one that read off my distinguished award, former student's award.

16:22.531 --> 16:35.367
I'll tell you, as I'm getting over, I'll tell you what's happened, really, I don't think it needs to be on here, but after you have a bypass, and then two, a couple stints, you've been off oxygen, there is a memory loss, and not much I can do about it.

16:36.308 --> 16:39.152
But, yeah, Rudder, I remember, is a great guy.

16:39.352 --> 16:46.100
Were you aware before what we now know was his fatal illness, were you aware that he was in declining health?

16:46.120 --> 16:46.841
No.

16:46.861 --> 16:48.203
I wasn't either.

16:48.223 --> 16:52.628
He looked robust and, you know, but didn't he have a heart attack?

16:52.648 --> 16:53.029
Yes.

16:53.089 --> 16:56.874
Yeah, so he had a heart attack and Williams did too, didn't he?

16:56.894 --> 16:57.114
All right.

16:57.675 --> 16:59.036
Mr. Rudder dies.

16:59.096 --> 17:02.901
He's replaced as an interim by General Ludicke.

17:02.921 --> 17:03.041
Right.

17:03.061 --> 17:08.548
Did you and the other faculty members have any relationship to Ludicke?

17:09.153 --> 17:10.236
as an engineer?

17:11.920 --> 17:25.677
Well you see I was I was my mission in life has been to be a prof and I've been extremely fortunate I don't worry about I don't I've never worried about the politics even though that's part of it but

17:25.994 --> 17:27.238
I thought he was fine.

17:27.418 --> 17:28.622
I just said no problem with him.

17:29.103 --> 17:31.089
I found out he was a woodworker or something.

17:31.109 --> 17:32.975
I thought, well, he can't go all bad.

17:32.995 --> 17:33.175
Ludicine?

17:33.356 --> 17:33.837
I believe so.

17:34.038 --> 17:34.780
Didn't know that.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.622
Built furniture.

17:36.686 --> 17:38.391
I believe you can check, but I believe so.

17:38.872 --> 17:40.898
So when they heard that, I said, well, he's bound to be okay.

17:41.182 --> 17:43.104
All right, then Dr. Williams.

17:43.805 --> 17:55.116
Oh, he was kind of a fresh, friendly guy that came in, but I don't remember any major policy changes or anything he did that would affect us that much.

17:55.817 --> 17:57.138
Someone turned off the whistle.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.760
I think Williams did that.

18:00.101 --> 18:04.245
Heard a whistle in Jacksonville the other day.

18:04.265 --> 18:06.487
It was in Jacksonville, and they still have a whistle there.

18:07.168 --> 18:08.730
I thought that was different.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.172
What I understand,

18:11.152 --> 18:31.941
was the reason is that some people who worked on the campus came to Dr. Williams and said, to those of us that are comparative newcomers, we feel that's like signaling that this is a factory, that there's a certain time you're supposed to start work and a certain time you stop work.

18:32.602 --> 18:38.210
Well, this could be true, but from what I got at the time when he first came, he said, well, that's one thing we're going to change.

18:38.230 --> 18:40.212
We're going to stop that.

18:40.653 --> 18:40.753
Yeah.

18:41.442 --> 18:41.743
All right.

18:41.763 --> 18:42.905
That's kind of what I remember.

18:42.925 --> 18:45.952
During those years, the enrollment is growing rapidly.

18:46.092 --> 18:46.253
Yeah.

18:46.273 --> 18:50.001
9,000, 16,000, 24,000.

18:50.522 --> 18:57.578
For you and your faculty colleagues, describe some of the impact of that on the industrial engineering.

18:59.363 --> 19:10.040
Well of course we, our hours teach, you know a lot of profs teach what's called nine hours and some of them six a semester and some of them nine.

19:10.661 --> 19:16.410
We were running about fourteen I remember at one time there trying to keep up and

19:17.622 --> 19:26.074
It looks like the university kept up with them pretty well and the stadium and the things that were happening, the classrooms.

19:26.114 --> 19:32.903
We got Teague building was in and we went to Zachary and then we had Weissenbaker.

19:32.923 --> 19:36.188
So I feel the planners were just a little bit short.

19:37.830 --> 19:39.493
We should have had a few more classrooms.

19:42.136 --> 19:46.903
But other than that I think we went along real smoothly.

19:47.086 --> 19:57.003
All right, give some examples of how the curriculum, the instruction in industrial engineering changed during those 20, 25 years.

19:57.083 --> 19:59.127
Yeah, well, you know, we brought the computer in.

20:00.409 --> 20:05.137
In 72, we got our calculators kind of came into being.

20:05.257 --> 20:06.439
Computers must have been 75.

20:07.321 --> 20:12.570
And then we've seen a great change in that and utilizing that.

20:12.905 --> 20:17.690
And the problem with engineering is you utilize the computers and get an answer.

20:18.571 --> 20:25.619
So you can teach a guy a program, he can input data and get an answer, but he doesn't know what's inside the program, what causes that to happen.

20:26.580 --> 20:34.509
But I'd say the greatest change has certainly been the computer and going away from hands-on, going away from labs.

20:35.950 --> 20:40.075
And I think the reason we're doing that is because of the cost and no one wants to teach a lab.

20:40.936 --> 20:42.017
Very few people do.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.483
I had four labs a week and I was there on every lab.

20:46.644 --> 20:50.869
And then for a while I had five labs a week, every day.

20:51.810 --> 20:57.816
But I think labs are doing away with hands-on, more thinking, more mathematical, more computer maybe.

20:58.837 --> 21:01.900
And I think we missed a lot in that.

21:02.340 --> 21:07.886
How did the student body of majors in industrial engineering, how did they change?

21:08.767 --> 21:09.928
They seemed to get smarter.

21:10.432 --> 21:17.521
Now, we've had the big question of grade inflation, but I think as the years go by, these kids were a lot smarter than we were when we came here.

21:18.242 --> 21:23.189
And the girls came in, and the girls we got at first were super girls.

21:24.170 --> 21:30.818
And, yeah, I guess that's the main thing.

21:31.900 --> 21:39.730
Dress, attitude is still about the same, kind of got— In your opinion, if you gave the same test—

21:40.688 --> 21:51.424
to the students of recent years and to students of 25 years ago, what kind of grade would they have made on the same test?

21:53.286 --> 21:56.130
Well, it depends on the teaching, you know, if the teaching was the same.

21:57.873 --> 22:03.882
But let's say that, well, we didn't have, well, what would they make?

22:03.902 --> 22:04.623
It's a good question.

22:05.764 --> 22:06.966
Like in, for me?

22:06.986 --> 22:08.248
Yeah, I know in years you can,

22:08.819 --> 22:18.460
that I think that I and my colleagues graded more rigorously in recent years, but the grades were higher.

22:18.520 --> 22:19.021
Yeah.

22:19.041 --> 22:20.905
Because the students were better prepared.

22:20.925 --> 22:22.008
Well, that's what I think.

22:22.809 --> 22:27.199
Yeah, being sharper and they come in with a lot of things that

22:27.652 --> 22:29.678
You know, they take calculus in high school.

22:29.698 --> 22:32.124
Well, I would have done that, but they didn't have it.

22:32.145 --> 22:33.488
They take advanced physics.

22:33.930 --> 22:35.053
We had one physics course.

22:35.494 --> 22:37.981
So I really feel the kids are much sharper than we were.

22:38.542 --> 22:40.227
I feel I've seen that change.

22:40.578 --> 22:49.741
in academics, but maybe less in attitude and ethics and judgment.

22:49.982 --> 22:51.526
That's what it is, yeah.

22:51.546 --> 22:54.192
Less in judgment.

22:54.353 --> 22:57.962
Did the student body become more urban in their background?

23:00.220 --> 23:12.596
I think so when you, I mean the old days we were from all over but there's something like five, three, four thousand freshmen from Houston and three from Dallas and three thousand and so on.

23:12.616 --> 23:14.038
So yeah I'd say that was a change.

23:14.098 --> 23:17.743
Maybe that's the reason we went from the old country boy approach to.

23:19.465 --> 23:26.535
How did you all try to stay in close understanding with industry?

23:27.336 --> 23:29.839
How did the department try to be sure that you were.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.505
teaching what was needed.

23:32.525 --> 23:47.246
Well I and Bill's we had field trips we had three-day field trips every year and we went to a lot of industries got the kids projects and a lot of industries so we could go kind of at least I had a good feel I thought of what they wanted.

23:48.347 --> 23:55.337
One of our biggest problems is our new sometimes the department heads want their want to push their

23:56.195 --> 24:01.423
uh, whatever they, their interest is instead of looking at what, what is needed.

24:01.944 --> 24:05.509
So I kept a record of every student to graduate and what job he did and what he made.

24:05.550 --> 24:13.001
I kept pictures of them since 73, took pictures of each one of them, tried to remember their names, kept, got a file of those in there.

24:15.826 --> 24:21.915
Um, well, I just think it just, um,

24:23.060 --> 24:23.581
They were sharp.

24:23.601 --> 24:24.522
How would they do on a test?

24:24.883 --> 24:27.126
I'd say they'd do better on a test than the old ones would.

24:27.586 --> 24:32.073
I think we're teaching a heck of a lot more in the time span than we used to.

24:33.455 --> 24:36.299
We're assuming a lot more things.

24:36.319 --> 24:43.068
And of course, the statistics and math is, I'm not sure it's necessary in IE because that's not what it is, but it's grown.

24:43.509 --> 24:47.054
For instance, I had a guy, you have time for an antidote or what?

24:47.074 --> 24:52.982
I had a guy, Tom Black, made all A's here, went to MIT and got two degrees in two years.

24:52.962 --> 25:01.600
now is doing great with Motorola, but I told Tom, he kept fussing at me to be a better computer jock, so you gotta be, you gotta learn that computer, Tom.

25:02.482 --> 25:05.488
Yeah, I mean, Doc, he said, that's all, that's what it all is.

25:06.570 --> 25:09.516
I said, well, Tom said, I'm a cutting-tarch engineer.

25:10.599 --> 25:11.781
Yeah, I told him a little story.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.744
Well, anyway, he graduated about four months later.

25:14.784 --> 25:17.448
He called me and said, Doc, Doc, I'm a cutting torch engineer.

25:18.069 --> 25:19.391
I said, OK, tell me about it.

25:19.792 --> 25:24.179
He had 20 men, a big sugar tank with M&M, and the feet didn't fit.

25:24.279 --> 25:25.781
The legs were all six inches.

25:26.402 --> 25:27.604
He said, I didn't know what to do.

25:28.185 --> 25:30.689
So the foreman said, well, we can take care of it.

25:30.709 --> 25:31.270
He said, OK.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.333
He said, hey, Bill, bring the cutting torch.

25:33.413 --> 25:36.638
And they cut them off and moved them over and put the thing.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.459
That actually happened to me with General Electric.

25:38.499 --> 25:43.246
I designed a square funnel and did it wrong, and I probably would have gotten fired.

25:43.287 --> 25:45.590
That was my first job, about a month into my job.

25:46.351 --> 25:51.981
An old foreman who I got to always be friendly with everybody and be nice and be nice with the foreman.

25:52.381 --> 25:53.603
He said, oh, we can take care of that.

25:53.623 --> 25:59.773
He said, Bill, bring the cutting tarts, and they made a beautiful funnel out of my screwed up design.

26:00.142 --> 26:02.365
and didn't tell anybody, just did it.

26:03.147 --> 26:06.332
So I told Tom that I think a lot of that's in engineering.

26:06.352 --> 26:13.463
A lot of it is doing something and being able to do something rather than the math involved in the science of it.

26:14.545 --> 26:28.326
As far as you're aware of the curriculum today in industrial engineering here and in industry's needs for industrial engineering graduates, what

26:29.588 --> 26:34.713
Should we teach more and what should we teach less?

26:35.434 --> 26:48.947
Well, of course, my approach is more mechanics and statics and labs and strength materials more than we've switched mostly to, we've got about six stat courses now and five math courses.

26:49.368 --> 26:53.372
And these guys, I don't think, as industrial engineers, are going to be using it.

26:53.432 --> 26:59.578
Now, as maybe as design mechanical engineers, maybe, I don't think so.

26:59.896 --> 27:05.141
What about in areas outside mechanical engineering, outside industrial engineering?

27:05.161 --> 27:06.462
Well, yeah.

27:07.163 --> 27:13.308
Well, of course, we have the, you know, I was on the faculty senate and kind of fought the core curriculum because it really isn't a core curriculum.

27:13.328 --> 27:14.529
It's an engineering core.

27:15.130 --> 27:17.592
The guys there don't take 10 hours of engineering.

27:18.373 --> 27:20.975
So at Gettysburg, they have a core.

27:20.995 --> 27:24.999
Everybody takes advanced math, calculus, physics, and then you can take what you want.

27:25.419 --> 27:26.340
That would be a real core.

27:27.101 --> 27:28.182
So we don't have that.

27:28.769 --> 27:29.971
I was pretty happy.

27:30.011 --> 27:35.540
We had about 18 hours of, of, of kind of people courses or liberal arts courses.

27:36.441 --> 27:38.344
The histories certainly are required.

27:44.835 --> 27:45.636
Well, I don't know.

27:45.656 --> 27:48.381
All right, let's bring women into this.

27:48.621 --> 27:53.629
When did women begin to take industrial engineering courses in large numbers?

27:55.077 --> 27:59.707
Right now I think there are more girls in industrial engineering than any other engineering percentage-wise.

27:59.767 --> 28:02.153
We were running about 35 percent as I remember.

28:02.674 --> 28:03.636
When did that start?

28:03.676 --> 28:04.057
72?

28:05.440 --> 28:10.892
We got our first one, first few in, they were sharp as a tack.

28:12.475 --> 28:15.460
You know, I don't have any idea, but I guess when everybody else started.

28:15.600 --> 28:20.708
Do you remember any experiences, anecdotes, fumbles?

28:22.230 --> 28:26.597
Yeah, everybody had to change their stories quite a bit about, you know, I remember that.

28:26.637 --> 28:37.454
The girls would play tricks on the props sometimes, but I was very careful, kept my door open at all times when I was an advisor for many and did that.

28:38.195 --> 28:40.879
The girls just added a lot to it.

28:42.243 --> 28:51.054
I had one sophomore girl that was brilliant, so I let her help me with the sophomore lab, but she just did a magnificent job and brought cookies to her babies, she said, her little babies.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.658
I thought that was cute, so we all had— And the students?

28:53.678 --> 28:55.059
Yeah, the students.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.784
She was a sophomore, see, and they were all sophomores, but she brought them to me.

28:58.804 --> 29:04.251
Now, how did those young men react to having a young woman as their—

29:04.822 --> 29:08.245
She was so great that you never knew it.

29:08.646 --> 29:14.091
I mean she was just so great and helpful and real smart and kind of redo some of the stuff.

29:15.733 --> 29:24.021
Do you remember any particular problems with any faculty member not wanting women in his classes?

29:24.041 --> 29:30.067
I remember a problem with a guy trying to give her a test at night, trying to give a cute little girl a test in her apartment at night.

29:30.107 --> 29:33.090
But he, somehow they found out about that man, didn't he?

29:33.678 --> 29:34.419
He was gone.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.965
I think he left mid-semester.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.287
No, there wasn't any problems with girls.

29:39.307 --> 29:41.310
It comes to find out there's no problems at all.

29:41.911 --> 29:50.185
Now the problem I had on field trips, I had to be sure that we had at least two girls in the same area kind of at all times.

29:50.620 --> 29:56.646
That bothered me and it's still, you know, very conscious of that thing, that part.

29:58.308 --> 29:58.929
In those years?

29:58.969 --> 30:00.230
No, they were great, man.

30:00.270 --> 30:03.634
The girls, the problem we have now is the girls are taking over everything.

30:03.954 --> 30:05.516
You look at Mustard, it's all girls.

30:06.437 --> 30:13.124
But again, they're just sharp and dedicated and by golly, they got the spirit.

30:13.164 --> 30:17.168
That's what really, when they came in, I thought they'd be real dainty.

30:17.637 --> 30:21.964
But they came in and they're just great, great solid citizens at our school.

30:22.265 --> 30:26.552
I think I know what you mean, but explain what you mean by that they have the spirit.

30:27.774 --> 30:32.642
Well, I thought that the girls would first off want to

30:35.828 --> 30:36.670
That's a good question.

30:36.750 --> 30:38.673
I'll see if I can, I don't know how to handle that.

30:40.256 --> 30:42.601
But they just, well they accept things.

30:42.681 --> 30:52.099
They aren't, they aren't quite as, I mean you don't have to be, you don't have to have a Cadillac sort of, that's not coming across right.

30:52.670 --> 30:54.632
I just think they're just solid like the guys.

30:55.253 --> 30:56.755
And they want to study.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.678
Oh, they're happy of A&M tradition.

30:59.038 --> 31:00.200
Their folks were there maybe.

31:00.480 --> 31:05.286
They aren't trying to break into the yell leaders, which they could get all-girl yell leaders if you wanted to.

31:07.208 --> 31:11.694
They participate and are smart as a whip, most of them.

31:11.934 --> 31:19.504
Do you recall any women trying to, pun intended, skirt around the rules to

31:19.754 --> 31:21.199
get around doing their homework?

31:21.721 --> 31:22.765
Did the women work as hard?

31:22.785 --> 31:31.435
I'd say a couple of them would try that, you know, coming out of, but I think the big thing is we didn't make any.
