00:01.938 --> 00:16.916
Oh,

00:01.938 --> 00:16.916
about a year ago, we were approached by

00:01.938 --> 00:16.916
representatives of the Snead family. Could you 
spell that? S-N-E-A-D. Of Georgetown, Texas and

00:18.618 --> 00:24.846
Austin. They are involved. as part owners of a 
small short line railroad and are very interested

00:31.199 --> 00:37.569
in the future of the railroad industry. And they 
were looking for some way to

00:38.991 --> 00:59.502
help, as it were, revitalize the railroad 
industry in this country and thought, and I think

00:38.991 --> 00:59.502
very wisely, that an educational institution 
would be a place where one could get some leverage

01:01.203 --> 01:06.790
So after some discussions, they decided to give us 
an endowment. Actually, the Texas A&M

01:07.591 --> 01:18.405
Development Foundation, strictly speaking, 
they were given an endowment of somewhat over half

01:07.591 --> 01:18.405
a million dollars. The purpose of this would be to 
establish the Snead chair in railway engineering

01:19.947 --> 01:27.858
in the civil engineering department. Now, the 
funds... What we would like to do, and what the

01:31.713 --> 01:53.124
purpose of the chair is, is to employ a professor 
who is widely known in the railway industry to

01:31.713 --> 01:53.124
establish a teaching and research program in the 
department in railway engineering.

01:56.389 --> 01:59.914
The research program, of course, would address 
problems of the railway industry could be

02:00.890 --> 02:24.579
economic problems, could be any kind of problem, 
the teaching program would enable us to graduate

02:00.890 --> 02:24.579
people who could go into the railway industry 
educated in the most modern and up-to-date

02:00.890 --> 02:24.579
engineering disciplines that impact or are 
important to the railroads.

02:28.683 --> 02:29.985
The purpose of the funds would be to augment the 
individual's salary, giving the chaired

02:30.353 --> 02:43.526
professor the time to develop these programs. As 
you probably know, we have to justify all of the

02:45.789 --> 02:52.996
salaries that we pay with state-appropriated 
funds. And so if we are able to pay a portion of the

02:54.337 --> 02:59.162
salary from other funds, then that give that 
professor release time to do these other

02:59.834 --> 03:04.701
activities which we think are important. So we're 
in the process of searching for someone, but we've

03:06.584 --> 03:10.610
had a problem. The railroad and railway industry 
in one sense academically has been dormant for so

03:11.892 --> 03:29.318
many years that finding people who are qualified 
in all the senses of the word, that is who can work

03:11.892 --> 03:29.318
with the railway industry, know the problems, 
find out what the problems are, and then lead the

03:29.804 --> 03:32.908
research and set up the academic program. And on 
the other hand, can meet the qualifications for an

03:34.089 --> 03:38.234
academic position. Those people are very few and 
far between. And so we've so far not had a lot of

03:43.340 --> 03:49.186
success in finding them. But we are continuing. 
And in the meantime, we are going to attempt to set

03:51.229 --> 03:59.338
up some other programs that will at least get us 
started in this business while we continue our

03:51.229 --> 03:59.338
search for a professor. Do railroads employ a lot 
of civil engineers? Yes, civil and mechanical by

04:02.730 --> 04:05.835
and large. There is, well for a long time there was 
no program in railroad, no academic program in

04:07.117 --> 04:19.356
railroad engineering anywhere except there was 
one professor at the University of Illinois who

04:07.117 --> 04:19.356
retired several years ago. Programs are now 
beginning to come back in in railroads. People are

04:27.955 --> 04:47.513
coming to the realization that for certain 
commodities that railroads are by and large the

04:27.955 --> 04:47.513
cheapest thing you possibly can do

04:27.955 --> 04:47.513
as far as bulk commodities and also the 
transportation system is in place all over the

04:27.955 --> 04:47.513
country. It's about to fall apart in certain 
places, but at least that we're not talking about

04:48.574 --> 04:55.600
having to establish a brand new transportation 
system. So with this, programs are beginning to

04:59.484 --> 05:05.813
come back in at certain academic institutions. 
And we think that that's appropriate, and we want

05:07.315 --> 05:10.980
to get one going ourselves. So that's where we're 
going with that. We want to continue our search for

05:14.745 --> 05:22.937
the chair, for the person to occupy the chair, and 
yet at the same time get a program started.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.025
Is there anything else that we need to touch upon 
before we close?

05:35.108 --> 05:39.513
Well, I guess I can't think of anything. I think 
you've had quite an inclusive list of questions

05:39.673 --> 05:47.661
there. Well, I appreciate interviewing you. 
Thank you. I appreciate your interest and wish you

05:53.067 --> 05:56.691
the best in your activities. Thank you.
