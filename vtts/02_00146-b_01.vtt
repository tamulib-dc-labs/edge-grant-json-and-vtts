WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:10.670
Was that the year, were you there the year when the group marched on Gibb Gilchrist's house?

00:10.790 --> 00:17.704
No, that must have been a year or two before I came to NM.

00:17.724 --> 00:19.989
Who was the president when you arrived?

00:20.931 --> 00:24.418
You know, I wouldn't have...

00:27.200 --> 00:29.447
I wouldn't have cared.

00:32.016 --> 00:34.363
Gilchrist may have been the president.

00:34.885 --> 00:40.062
The first president I have, well,

00:41.341 --> 00:42.823
Because I don't believe it was Harrington yet.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.545
No, it wasn't Harrington.

00:44.685 --> 00:46.227
It may have been Gilchrist.

00:46.467 --> 00:47.448
I don't know.

00:47.528 --> 00:48.850
We didn't care.

00:48.890 --> 00:57.039
Administration at the university meant nothing to us.

00:57.480 --> 01:04.969
We knew more about the commandant and all of the military classes and all of that.

01:05.029 --> 01:08.833
We didn't have any idea who was

01:09.303 --> 01:18.258
a department head or a dean or a president or anything, and it just wasn't part of our interest.

01:18.278 --> 01:23.085
As far as you and your buddies were aware, what were the most important student leadership roles?

01:25.249 --> 01:32.020
Only significant leadership roles were officers in the court could do it.

01:33.535 --> 01:35.517
and I guess the Ross Volunteers.

01:36.819 --> 01:43.206
And that was, again, not that big a deal.

01:43.226 --> 01:53.919
It was strictly just your flight and your core organizational structure, your first sergeant and CO and stuff like that.

01:53.939 --> 01:55.240
Did the L leader mean much?

01:56.622 --> 01:57.523
Not a great deal.

01:58.324 --> 01:59.425
Not a great deal.

01:59.708 --> 02:07.983
Now, the veterans were still occupying some of the project houses and some temporary structures.

02:11.068 --> 02:17.038
Yeah, they were pretty well all gone the time I left to graduate here in 1952.

02:17.179 --> 02:17.459
Okay.

02:18.701 --> 02:24.231
We went from about 12,000 students down to about 7,000 the time I graduated.

02:24.582 --> 02:35.381
Were there any difficulties that you realized that Brian Field Fish had when they came back the next year to the campus as sophomores?

02:35.882 --> 02:37.084
Did they blend in well?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.109
No, I didn't see any problem.

02:40.149 --> 02:44.717
You know, there were so few of us that...

02:44.697 --> 02:58.441
You just had to stick together, and then the outfits were, you know, they were anxious to have the people from the air base come into their outfit.

02:58.481 --> 03:03.870
You had to keep, you had to have enough people to have an outfit.

03:03.850 --> 03:09.378
Was Pinky Downs around in those years?

03:09.578 --> 03:10.900
Yes, Pinky was here.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.703
Describe Pinky and his role.

03:12.963 --> 03:17.670
Well, Pinky, I knew him as being at our football practices every day.

03:19.732 --> 03:21.555
Pinky would be there.

03:21.535 --> 03:42.363
He was a great supporter of athletics, and I remember I was practicing football one afternoon, and I had that particular play.

03:42.423 --> 03:46.328
They ran around

03:46.696 --> 03:50.947
They ran around their left and would have been over on my right.

03:52.270 --> 04:01.735
And we used to run a power play to the right and left.

04:02.457 --> 04:09.851
I got tangled up in the middle of that thing, and you had about six guys running interference.

04:09.972 --> 04:16.124
Anyhow, when I got up out of the mire and looked up, there was my dad.

04:16.985 --> 04:19.470
It unexpectedly appeared.

04:19.450 --> 04:23.496
About the only time he'd ever been here again.

04:24.658 --> 04:27.062
And he was talking to Pinky Downs.

04:28.444 --> 04:32.991
And he always remembered Pinky.

04:33.572 --> 04:42.787
To have gotten up off and see my father and Pinky there was kind of a strange vision.

04:43.448 --> 04:46.032
What was Pinky's task?

04:46.163 --> 04:47.225
I never did know.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.269
I didn't even know.

04:49.289 --> 04:54.538
I don't know whether he even worked or anything.

04:54.598 --> 04:58.425
He was just at football practice.

04:58.445 --> 05:01.330
I don't know whether he was employed by the university or not.

05:01.350 --> 05:02.312
His daughter was.

05:03.454 --> 05:05.898
His daughter was named Gray, I think.

05:06.620 --> 05:07.661
Gray Downs.

05:07.681 --> 05:08.543
Gray Downs.

05:08.523 --> 05:12.414
She worked at the bookstore.

05:13.638 --> 05:17.809
I think she was Miss Texas or something when she was growing up.

05:17.829 --> 05:23.325
Now, during your sophomore year, do you begin to zero in on agriculture as a major?

05:25.465 --> 05:26.706
Oh, I guess so.

05:29.209 --> 05:34.754
You know, you only really kind of had only about two routes, three routes to go.

05:34.794 --> 05:47.427
You could either go engineering or agriculture or business, and business was thought to be the run and play curriculum.

05:50.470 --> 05:55.135
Those that couldn't do engineering or agriculture took business, I guess.

05:56.279 --> 05:59.524
Oh, were there any CUSH courses for athletes?

05:59.885 --> 06:00.145
No.

06:01.948 --> 06:05.033
No, we were thrown right in with all of them.

06:05.053 --> 06:07.156
But was there any course that y'all might take?

06:07.176 --> 06:07.236
No.

06:07.817 --> 06:09.700
One course to get a grade point?

06:09.901 --> 06:10.121
No.

06:11.443 --> 06:18.895
I guess the only way that you might have

06:20.275 --> 06:32.186
been a little easier if you really wanted to be a coach or something to have taken more, which was going to be your vocation more.

06:33.207 --> 06:44.577
But no, we never had any, never had any preferential treatment or we were in the same student body and the same quizzes and everything.

06:44.717 --> 06:47.920
Right, now did you go all four years and then to vet school?

06:48.862 --> 06:54.288
I went four years, finished in 52, and then went to the Air Force.

06:54.328 --> 06:56.810
We all had to go to the Korean War.

06:57.091 --> 06:57.932
And then came back.

06:58.112 --> 06:59.794
And then I came back in 54.

07:03.758 --> 07:05.199
We'll get to that in a minute.

07:07.542 --> 07:12.287
When you and your buddies went off campus for fun, where did you all go?

07:14.157 --> 07:15.880
We didn't go off campus.

07:16.842 --> 07:19.026
I mean, that's a peculiar thing.

07:19.046 --> 07:29.166
There was one place in town that I went with, used to go, went once or twice with football players called Navels.

07:29.186 --> 07:29.667
What?

07:29.687 --> 07:31.390
Navels, which was a

07:31.943 --> 07:34.347
Place that sold beer in Bryan.

07:35.249 --> 07:36.291
Remember how to spell it?

07:36.311 --> 07:37.954
N-A-V-E-L-S.

07:38.314 --> 07:38.735
Navels.

07:39.256 --> 07:39.636
Where?

07:40.338 --> 07:41.139
Downtown Bryan?

07:42.061 --> 07:45.226
It was in Bryan.

07:45.887 --> 07:50.796
I'd say I probably only went to Bryan twice while I was at all

07:51.451 --> 08:02.476
time I was nearly at A&M, but there was a football player named Jones, Desmond Jones, from Orange, Texas.

08:02.837 --> 08:04.240
Doing well.

08:04.260 --> 08:07.688
And he was a little on the risque side

08:08.765 --> 08:13.190
And he used to, he took me into Navels a couple of times.

08:13.210 --> 08:16.513
He was my classmate at Orange High.

08:18.495 --> 08:19.757
Desmond Jones.

08:19.837 --> 08:20.678
And he ended up at.

08:20.698 --> 08:23.461
He didn't stay here but one semester or one year.

08:23.501 --> 08:28.666
And he ended up then at being a coach at McNeese State.

08:28.887 --> 08:29.547
Is that right?

08:29.567 --> 08:31.389
And a fellow named R.C.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.151
Slocum was one of his products.

08:33.271 --> 08:34.092
Is that right?

08:34.112 --> 08:34.493
Because R.C.'

08:34.473 --> 08:35.734
's from Orange also.

08:35.714 --> 08:42.668
He was a fun guy.

08:43.369 --> 08:46.756
He had a gold tooth or something.

08:48.279 --> 08:49.902
We were real good friends.

08:50.543 --> 08:52.627
I think he only stayed here a semester.

08:52.848 --> 08:56.575
He didn't quite make it academically.

08:56.595 --> 08:58.178
I can't remember.

08:58.613 --> 09:00.077
Desmond Jones.

09:00.458 --> 09:04.047
I went to Navel's with him a couple of times.

09:05.470 --> 09:08.899
Did you know of anybody who went to Whiskey Bridge?

09:09.901 --> 09:10.362
No.

09:11.545 --> 09:12.648
What about Uncle Ed's?

09:14.252 --> 09:15.475
I may have

09:16.670 --> 09:19.777
I don't know whether Uncle Ed's was still there.

09:19.797 --> 09:24.888
It may have still been there when I came back to vet school.

09:25.009 --> 09:26.352
I can't remember how long.

09:26.412 --> 09:31.543
I had been there maybe once while I was at school.

09:31.563 --> 09:34.189
Did y'all go to the campus theater much?

09:34.760 --> 09:38.747
No, I never went to Campus Theater.

09:39.769 --> 09:56.920
Guy and Hall was open at that time, and so it was right across the street from Hart Hall, and we'd sit out there and wait until the ticket girl left at the last feature, and we'd go over to Guy and Hall sometime.

09:56.900 --> 10:03.356
Describe what went on during the movie in Guyon Hall with a room full of Aggies.

10:03.376 --> 10:08.528
I don't remember being any different than any other place.

10:08.849 --> 10:14.503
All right, I've heard that sometimes they'd yell out laugh and boo and cheer.

10:17.420 --> 10:18.643
I don't remember that.

10:18.663 --> 10:20.367
Okay.

10:21.008 --> 10:24.716
Of course, having slipped in, I probably wouldn't be saying much.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.886
Now, did you have any dates when you were an undergraduate here?

10:29.688 --> 10:30.149
No.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.015
No.

10:34.936 --> 10:50.201
Well, I may have a girl that I married from Beaumont used to come on Mother's Day when my mother would come.

10:50.261 --> 10:57.453
And she came to the senior ring dance, I believe.

10:58.255 --> 11:00.538
Now this was, you had known her in high school.

11:01.019 --> 11:01.500
Yeah.

11:01.649 --> 11:02.370
And how did she?

11:02.630 --> 11:06.196
In the junior prom, junior prom.

11:07.157 --> 11:10.361
How did y'all communicate while you were a student?

11:11.363 --> 11:11.643
Did you write?

11:11.663 --> 11:13.306
Oh, a letter every night, boy.

11:14.027 --> 11:15.709
Did you write her every night?

11:15.729 --> 11:15.990
Yeah.

11:16.991 --> 11:19.535
And how often did you call her?

11:19.555 --> 11:19.955
Oh, never.

11:21.337 --> 11:23.320
We didn't have any telephone.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.401
And what was she, was she in school?

11:27.541 --> 11:29.664
She was at Lamar College.

11:29.724 --> 11:32.247
She was at Lamar, okay.

11:32.267 --> 11:33.950
Lamar Junior College.

11:34.450 --> 11:38.075
Did she come to any of the dances here before your senior year?

11:39.096 --> 11:40.177
Yeah, no.

11:40.438 --> 11:44.242
Yeah, my junior prom.

11:44.303 --> 11:45.404
Did we have a junior?

11:45.424 --> 11:47.046
I had something my junior year.

11:48.410 --> 11:50.112
And where did she stay?

11:51.233 --> 11:53.916
Well, she got to stay at the MSC.

11:53.936 --> 11:55.337
It was brand new.

11:56.618 --> 11:59.882
Didn't have about ten rooms or something.

11:59.922 --> 12:02.564
I don't know how I got that room.

12:02.584 --> 12:08.030
I guess her mother wouldn't let her come unless I had some arrangements.

12:08.691 --> 12:09.972
And do you remember how she came?

12:09.992 --> 12:12.915
Did she come on the train or the bus?

12:16.861 --> 12:26.432
I want to think that there was another girl from Beaumont that came, and they may have come by car.

12:27.155 --> 12:30.478
I can't remember how she got here.

12:31.800 --> 12:35.463
Now, she could have come by train.

12:37.065 --> 12:52.960
I rode the train once from Beaumont because in the winter of 49, it got down to about six below here and snowed

12:55.167 --> 13:00.374
about two feet or something, all over the state of Texas.

13:00.394 --> 13:06.862
And I couldn't get back, so I had to ride a, I rode a train back from Beaumont one time.

13:08.525 --> 13:14.172
The, um, you went to some of the other dances, though, even without a date.

13:14.995 --> 13:15.476
No.

13:15.896 --> 13:16.257
You didn't?

13:16.337 --> 13:17.519
Didn't care anything about it.

13:17.539 --> 13:20.323
We didn't have any social things going on.

13:22.365 --> 13:32.380
It just, and you had the time you got through with military and intermules and studying.

13:33.702 --> 13:35.704
You didn't have time for anything, you know.

13:36.886 --> 13:37.086
Right.

13:37.146 --> 13:40.571
The Korean War started in the summer of 1950.

13:40.872 --> 13:41.252
Right.

13:43.075 --> 13:44.597
And then that fall,

13:46.012 --> 13:53.444
that we were all told that we'd have troops home by Christmas, but then it went bad that fall.

13:55.888 --> 14:03.020
And where I was in college, a lot of the students didn't come back after Christmas to finish the fall semester.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.442
They went ahead and volunteered.

14:05.317 --> 14:07.844
What were you and your buddies thinking about that war?

14:07.925 --> 14:08.827
You were in the Corps?

14:09.529 --> 14:18.195
We were in the Corps and going to be commissioned, of course, and so we were...

14:19.610 --> 14:27.142
We felt like that's the reason we were here, was to go to the service.

14:27.323 --> 14:31.149
And so we were anxious to get into the service.

14:31.289 --> 14:39.643
And, of course, I being in the Air Force Corps,

14:39.623 --> 14:52.549
The ground cadets always said they were the ones that really fought the war.

14:52.869 --> 14:56.316
They were going to fight the war, the fly boys.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.460
weren't going to be very much use in the war.

15:00.161 --> 15:05.588
But we were, they say it was so different from some of the others.

15:07.410 --> 15:17.163
The fact that we were very anxious to go and looking forward to it, that was just part of it.

15:17.183 --> 15:24.092
Did your, after your junior year, did you go to summer training?

15:24.697 --> 15:31.042
No, we didn't have to go to summer training because I can't remember why.

15:31.243 --> 15:34.335
Everybody always went to summer camp.

15:34.990 --> 15:46.086
But we didn't have to go because maybe the war was on or because we knew we were going straight into the service.

15:46.106 --> 15:51.374
But I didn't go to summer camp between my junior and senior year like everybody did.

15:51.394 --> 15:52.436
I don't know why.

15:54.098 --> 16:01.669
During your senior year, did events in Korea seem to affect any of the military training here?

16:02.170 --> 16:03.512
No, no.

16:04.555 --> 16:07.099
Didn't seem to impact on anything.

16:07.680 --> 16:12.528
We just knew there was a war and that we were going to the service.

16:14.872 --> 16:26.310
As you and your friends were getting ready for graduation, how did you all feel?

16:27.640 --> 16:37.671
Oh, we, most of us were, of course, we were commissioned at graduation, and we knew we were going.

16:37.751 --> 16:44.979
We just, we had to go and, we had to leave and go back home until we got our orders cut.

16:45.019 --> 16:49.083
We didn't know when we were going, but we waited.

16:50.144 --> 16:57.192
We were anxious to get our orders, and I could have

16:57.172 --> 17:11.508
I could have stayed at A&M instead of going to the service, but because I could have gone on, continued my education in veterinary college.

17:11.528 --> 17:20.378
But I decided I wanted to go ahead and get my service obligations out of the way, and I did that.

17:20.358 --> 17:25.884
Now, how soon were you sure Veteran Medicine was going to be your future?

17:26.926 --> 17:29.328
Oh, that was occurred.

17:29.869 --> 17:36.536
I had talked to Dr. Boughton, Dean Boughton, before I went to the service.

17:36.797 --> 17:50.112
And he, just a little bit about what it, you know, about getting in, what it was like and so forth.

17:50.648 --> 17:52.051
Never thought much about it.

17:55.437 --> 18:12.387
Christmas before I was to finish up Air Force, I happened to tell my wife I might go by College Station and see what it would take to go to veterinary school.

18:13.312 --> 18:23.237
So I went by and I talked to them again and they said, well, you need two chemistry courses and a physics course to get into veterinary school.

18:25.529 --> 18:44.492
So I went to night school for a semester, my last year in the service and took chemistry and physics at night and got in.

18:44.612 --> 18:50.980
It wasn't quite as difficult to get in then as it is now.

18:50.960 --> 18:55.426
All right, now we want to talk about vet school in a minute, but let's finish your undergraduate days first.

18:58.150 --> 19:04.799
Describe your final review as a senior.

19:06.922 --> 19:09.826
Oh, final review and all of that.

19:09.846 --> 19:11.488
Who was here and where was it?

19:12.870 --> 19:15.413
Oh, it was over on the drill field.

19:15.433 --> 19:18.738
Of course, we had a situation.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.460
We had a...

19:23.377 --> 19:34.472
We had a commandant here named Boatner that was really tough.

19:34.613 --> 19:36.956
I mean, he drove around the Jeep.

19:37.356 --> 19:38.658
You say the commandant?

19:40.040 --> 19:40.140
Yeah.

19:40.160 --> 19:40.581
Bolton?

19:41.622 --> 19:42.143
Boatner.

19:42.323 --> 19:43.305
Oh, oh, Boatner.

19:43.705 --> 19:45.267
Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes.

19:45.448 --> 19:46.469
General Boatner.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.190
Yes.

19:47.170 --> 19:51.617
He drove around in a jeep and he dressed us down.

19:51.937 --> 19:56.644
Anytime he saw anything, he was hard on us.

19:58.207 --> 20:10.866
I remember one football game, one of those cadets took his jacket off and gave it to a girl, his girlfriend, because she was about to freeze.

20:10.846 --> 20:17.043
Boatner saw that and put him on a bullring for the rest of the year.

20:18.808 --> 20:25.868
Anyhow, the

20:26.067 --> 20:37.518
We had, of course, march buys and commissioning and all that was tied together.

20:40.541 --> 20:53.374
I probably remember more the final review when I was a junior, when I was made a senior because I got my boots and everything.

20:53.354 --> 20:55.577
Where'd you buy your boots?

20:55.597 --> 20:58.982
I bought them from another student.

20:59.042 --> 21:10.818
Secondhand I paid fifteen or twenty dollars for Calvary boots and a pair, two pair of boot pants.

21:10.838 --> 21:20.391
One was pinks, they were wool and one was khaki and spurs.

21:20.371 --> 21:23.996
And how long did you keep the boots?

21:24.436 --> 21:26.760
Till I graduated and I sold them.

21:26.940 --> 21:27.521
For how much?

21:27.941 --> 21:29.744
Probably the same thing.

21:29.784 --> 21:30.324
Broke even?

21:31.286 --> 21:37.274
Yeah, a friend of mine died the other day and I went to his funeral and they had his senior boots.

21:37.434 --> 21:45.805
I didn't have any inclination of keeping them because I needed that money.

21:45.785 --> 21:50.733
And what kind of feelings did you have when you first put on those boots?

21:51.714 --> 21:56.061
Oh, it was something that you really had looked forward to and worked for.

21:57.383 --> 22:04.374
I don't think they fitted too well, best I remember, but I certainly couldn't have a pair made.

22:04.855 --> 22:06.057
You didn't get any blisters?

22:07.239 --> 22:13.969
Yeah, it seemed like they weren't exactly the right size, but

22:14.168 --> 22:25.644
Were there any special times when you wore those boots during your senior year that... Oh, we march-ins, I guess.

22:29.630 --> 22:35.217
Court trips.

22:35.898 --> 22:39.483
We didn't wear them routinely, of course.

22:39.664 --> 22:42.167
It was just mainly for a ceremony.

22:43.126 --> 22:50.834
All right, and then commencement, well, so who, who, family and friends came to commencement and find review?

22:52.815 --> 23:02.084
Oh, I imagine my, I think my mother and daddy and... Did that special, young lady who... And Mary, I guess.

23:02.105 --> 23:03.786
We didn't have large numbers.

23:04.667 --> 23:09.792
I know when I finally used to chair the...

23:09.772 --> 23:23.524
Graduation for the veterinary college, we used to figure on, we needed space for 15 visitors for every graduate.

23:23.544 --> 23:28.228
But when I graduated, it was my mother and dad, and Mary is all I remember.

23:29.529 --> 23:32.332
And we graduated on Kyle Field.

23:33.673 --> 23:38.597
And I don't, for life, remember who spoke at graduation or anything.

23:38.948 --> 23:44.256
Eisenhower had been here my senior year and that was a big deal.

23:45.037 --> 23:52.609
I just remember that event on Kyle Field when he came here and spoke in 51 or 52.

23:53.250 --> 23:56.535
Was every at commencement every name called, every hand shaken?

23:58.473 --> 23:59.094
Yes.

23:59.154 --> 24:00.576
You were handed your diploma?

24:00.596 --> 24:02.358
Yes, yes.

24:02.378 --> 24:07.365
And did you think that you were probably going off to Korea pretty soon?

24:07.386 --> 24:10.029
Oh, yeah.

24:11.171 --> 24:20.464
We all preferred that we could have gotten orders then and left from here rather than having to go home and wait.

24:21.085 --> 24:24.109
What was the typical student attitude about the war?

24:25.017 --> 24:52.542
Oh, we didn't look at it from any political reason for it or anything else except it was a conflict that the country had involved itself and that it was, if the country thought it was something that needed to be done, you know, we were just anxious to go.

24:52.562 --> 24:55.024
I mean, it was just something we'd been trained for.

24:55.392 --> 25:01.357
Do you remember any student activism against the war?

25:01.377 --> 25:04.660
No, no, no, no, no.

25:04.680 --> 25:08.344
Everybody was, that's what we came to A&M for.

25:08.724 --> 25:19.334
How well prepared did you think A&M had, how much preparation did you think A&M had given you for the real world of being an officer?

25:20.455 --> 25:23.818
Excellent compared to other ROTC graduates.

25:23.938 --> 25:25.399
Why did you think that?

25:25.379 --> 25:40.992
Well, most of us ended up as really section chiefs and

25:42.541 --> 26:02.102
My career ended up setting up a pre-flight train school at Lackland Air Force Base, and they took 60 A&M lieutenants and made us

26:02.082 --> 26:16.203
had us set the program up and operate the whole pre-flight program and all of the other OOTC graduates were under our supervision.

26:16.343 --> 26:20.930
So for what we did, we were well prepared.

26:22.392 --> 26:25.557
And how much did that ring cost?

26:26.459 --> 26:27.160
$35.

26:27.941 --> 26:29.423
Remember where you got the money?

26:31.394 --> 26:33.738
I remember getting it.

26:34.258 --> 26:35.120
I remember.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.144
Was it, did your parents give it to you or did you?

26:38.244 --> 26:41.650
No, I'm sure I paid for it myself.

26:42.030 --> 26:50.684
And it was, we had a ring clerk, and I can't, my wife, I remember.

26:52.286 --> 26:58.195
But getting a badge for your ring and everything was kind of, it was a,

26:58.175 --> 27:04.462
I guess more than boots or anything was the biggest thing.

27:05.243 --> 27:24.705
I don't, not having, not having graduated from another college, I don't know how significant graduation rings were, but to us it was the ultimate, I guess, we got them when we were juniors.

27:24.685 --> 27:29.670
Do you have any ring stories to tell of where you lost it and found?

27:29.730 --> 27:30.931
No, no.

27:31.272 --> 27:32.233
Any place you've been?

27:32.293 --> 27:33.234
Don't take it off.

27:34.095 --> 27:41.202
Have you ever been somewhere and someone spotted it somewhere on the other side of the world or something like that?

27:42.283 --> 27:45.866
No, that's happened a lot, but I can't recall.

27:46.107 --> 27:52.313
I mean, that's something that A&M graduates always look for when you go into it.

27:53.120 --> 27:58.613
Anywhere you go, a restaurant or anywhere, you just look for an Aggie ring.

27:59.635 --> 28:01.861
You always whip out and meet people.

28:03.865 --> 28:07.534
It's just so routine you don't think anything about it.

28:08.020 --> 28:12.504
All right, you go to the Air Force and you're on active duty how long?

28:13.084 --> 28:13.545
Two years.

28:13.765 --> 28:14.285
Two years.

28:14.986 --> 28:19.870
Then come back and admitted to... Veterinary College.

28:20.031 --> 28:23.994
Veterinary College in the fall of 50... 54.

28:25.856 --> 28:27.037
What was the routine?

28:28.118 --> 28:31.360
You're the first one now, so this is all brand new area to me.

28:32.261 --> 28:36.525
What was the routine then for application and admission?

28:37.602 --> 28:47.106
Well, you made application probably like

28:51.153 --> 28:58.763
January, fall, I mean January perhaps of the year that you were going to hope to get in.

28:58.803 --> 29:06.693
They had very specific prerequisites that you had to have to get in.

29:07.955 --> 29:10.318
And then they had a selection process.

29:11.560 --> 29:19.590
And I can't, have no idea how many applicants they had at that time.

29:20.228 --> 29:29.082
I know everybody coming into my class had a better than a three-point grade point average.

29:31.365 --> 29:47.991
We had a change of deans from the time I graduated, undergraduate, came back to vet school from Dean Boughton to Dean Armistead, who was a very, very

29:47.971 --> 30:02.114
stick there for cleanliness and dress and grades and academics and so when I came back the service of veterinary school had changed quite a bit.

30:02.274 --> 30:07.042
We were getting ready to move into new new facilities.

30:07.423 --> 30:10.688
Now where were those new facilities?

30:10.668 --> 30:12.391
here where they are now.

30:12.411 --> 30:13.893
And what was over here?

30:13.913 --> 30:14.694
West Campus.

30:15.495 --> 30:16.336
This was it.

30:16.977 --> 30:17.358
How big?

30:17.458 --> 30:21.143
What described the structures that opened that fall?

30:21.163 --> 30:32.640
Well, there were two buildings and we had the Basic Sciences building and a distance of several hundred yards between it and then we had the clinics.

30:32.660 --> 30:35.865
We had a small animal, a large animal clinic and

30:35.845 --> 30:55.633
The clinic portion was built first because I took my first semester or first year of veterinary school on main campus in the old veterinary complex, and then we moved out here maybe in the spring.

30:55.733 --> 30:57.556
I can't remember.

30:57.576 --> 31:01.161
That would have been spring of 55.

31:01.141 --> 31:06.329
The clinics were started, I guess, in the fall of 54.

31:07.791 --> 31:14.001
And how many were in that, entered that fall in 54?

31:14.061 --> 31:16.846
We took 64 in a class.

31:16.886 --> 31:17.186
64.

31:18.468 --> 31:20.892
Had that number been standard for a good while?

31:21.393 --> 31:23.576
Yeah, it seemed to be all of it in their schools.

31:23.596 --> 31:24.638
It was pretty standard.

31:25.099 --> 31:25.900
It was so that...
