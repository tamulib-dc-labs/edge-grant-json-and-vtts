WEBVTT

00:01.448 --> 00:05.595
their wartime experiences as the high point in 
their life. But if you're a professional soldier,

00:06.597 --> 00:13.790
which I was, that's just going to work in the 
morning. It's not pleasant. I remember the bad

00:15.012 --> 00:18.057
things about it. People dying. A young sergeant 
died in my arms one time. He got shot.

00:28.837 --> 00:32.741
A couple of my boys got their legs blown off when 
they stepped on mines. Had a crazy captain buddy of

00:34.803 --> 00:37.346
mine shot his own thumb off. But, you remember 
those things, but that's, that's not, you're who

00:38.727 --> 00:48.317
you are before you go over there, and I certainly 
was, and the war didn't change me. My experiences

00:49.258 --> 00:51.180
in combat didn't change me. I think, like I said, I 
think being a daddy had more impact on my life. I

00:54.643 --> 00:58.287
learned more about and changed my outlook on life 
more. when I had kids than the war did. Certainly

01:02.613 --> 01:04.836
not my death, but I'm not going to be thinking about 
Vietnam. I'm going to be thinking about my family.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.287
What are your thoughts about the anti-war 
protesters? Well, do you really want to know? I

01:16.934 --> 01:18.036
really want to know. I think they're a bunch of 
traitors. I think people who are honestly against

01:20.960 --> 01:27.109
the war have a right to put forth their opinion, but 
I think some of these people that call themselves

01:27.511 --> 01:32.399
anti-war protesters, nothing more than 
sympathizes with the enemy. They're the betrayal

01:33.541 --> 01:36.866
of their own countrymen and the role they're 
fighting. Jane Fonda's a classic. Is that why you

01:38.709 --> 01:39.911
don't like her? I don't like her. I don't like her at 
all. I don't like what she did, and I don't like what

01:43.016 --> 01:49.546
she's doing today in 1988 to try to make amends for. 
Because those boys over there said, how could she

01:50.788 --> 01:53.873
do that? How could she get away with it? She goes to 
North Vietnam and pats those guys on the head

01:55.104 --> 02:00.050
telling them what a great job she's doing. You 
know, they're doing. And those people and their

02:01.472 --> 02:06.958
buddies are killing Americans.

02:06.978 --> 02:16.189
Now, if she is so against America, why doesn't she 
go to North Vietnam and become a North Vietnamese

02:06.978 --> 02:16.189
film star now? She'd like a life in America. Yeah, 
sure, she's making some bucks and she's selling

02:17.370 --> 02:21.295
these little exercise tapes and all this crap. And 
I understand her career ain't going too well. And

02:25.566 --> 02:28.850
of course, those guys never forget somebody's 
been betrayed them like that. And she's been kind

02:28.910 --> 02:33.136
of a, she's the head of the temple, if you will. 
She's the most visible of them all. But if this had

02:36.079 --> 02:42.367
been World War II, that woman would have been tried 
and convicted and probably sentenced to death for

02:36.079 --> 02:42.367
what she did. That's terrible what she did. She 
went over there and encouraged those people to

02:45.190 --> 02:47.273
kill Americans. And she murdered herself. She 
said it in the name of anti-war processing.

02:51.683 --> 02:52.144
Bullshit. That wasn't anti-war processing. She 
was going there and giving aid and encouragement

02:53.926 --> 02:57.412
to the enemy. That's wrong. She shouldn't have 
done that. You know, this is the day of no

03:01.418 --> 03:04.122
absolutes, right? Everything is gray, but what 
she did was definitely black. Very, very bad. She

03:08.449 --> 03:12.154
shouldn't have done that. And what about the kids 
and the college kids and even the grownups who just

03:12.174 --> 03:19.125
protested in the streets? Well, you know, those 
people got to write their voice, their opinion.

03:23.690 --> 03:32.564
And...

03:23.690 --> 03:32.564
Did you resent them because you gave part of your 
life, a year of your life to the effort? No, I didn't

03:32.685 --> 03:33.686
give... I don't resent... I didn't resent that 
if...

03:40.817 --> 03:45.104
I would have resented it if I was there against my 
will, but I went there willingly. Because...

03:50.020 --> 03:51.362
Would I resent that? Did I resent it?

03:57.350 --> 03:58.211
I don't think I resent it. I was disappointed in the 
fact that all of the American people didn't get

03:58.231 --> 04:07.984
behind us while we went over there and put our meat 
on the line.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.211
And we're out there serving the country. That 
means all the Americans. We're out there

04:14.593 --> 04:16.315
performing our public service. kind of like a 
fireman goes to a fire and some people are

04:18.218 --> 04:25.667
protesting the fact that he's trying to put the 
fire out. Can you relate to that? Okay, we were

04:28.450 --> 04:31.594
going out there, we thought we were doing the right 
thing. Our government told us we were doing the

04:32.676 --> 04:34.298
right thing. The civilians that we worked for were 
telling us that we were doing the right thing. Some

04:38.903 --> 04:42.808
civilians said, you know, you're terrible and 
they just didn't say what you, what you're doing is

04:43.008 --> 04:47.835
wrong, they try to make us some kind of monsters, 
you know, baby killers and all kinds of stuff. Do

04:49.737 --> 04:51.259
you regret your involvement in the war? No. 
Because at that time, I was participating in the

04:53.522 --> 04:59.791
tribulations of my time. I think it was some great 
philosopher once said, a man who does not

05:00.592 --> 05:12.188
participate in the tribulations and triumphs of 
his time can be accused of not having lived

05:15.678 --> 05:16.479
period of time. I'm glad I was there and 
participated in it. That was my job. That was what I

05:20.144 --> 05:22.667
signed on to do. That was my responsibility. That 
was my task, if you will. That was what I was doing

05:27.734 --> 05:30.138
then. I was a soldier, and if I had not been there, I 
would have missed it. I would have not been doing my

05:34.303 --> 05:36.546
job. Okay. How do you feel about the draft dodgers, 
or the people who, well, the people who went to

05:37.688 --> 05:45.178
Canada, or the people who faked ailments or tried 
to get out of it or tried to join the National Guard?

05:50.280 --> 06:04.820
Well, you know, a lot of guys my age are lawyers and 
dentists and doctors and have PhDs and stuff and if

05:50.280 --> 06:04.820
there had been no war in Vietnam, most of those guys 
would have never gone on to college. So, you say

06:07.344 --> 06:12.010
people who avoided participating in a war Some 
went to Canada, some went to graduate school. A

06:17.580 --> 06:19.722
man's got to follow his own conscience. That's the 
beauty of America. We let you get away with it. You

06:25.968 --> 06:27.149
follow your own conscience. You do what your 
conscience says, even in the face of censure by

06:27.189 --> 06:31.213
your peer group. But I tell you what, I was in the 3rd 
Battalion, 22nd Infantry for a few weeks, and we

06:32.154 --> 06:38.641
got in a hell of a combat situation. I got to know a 
Spec 5 medic And I stood there while they pinned the

06:42.770 --> 06:46.776
Distinguished Service Cross on that guy's chest.

06:49.820 --> 06:53.225
There's only one greater award that you can get and 
that's the Medal of Honor. This guy had crawled out

06:53.866 --> 06:59.414
in the fire in combat to rescue wounded GIs.

07:03.420 --> 07:04.762
Medics do that all the time. He just did it well and 
he did it a lot of times. So they gave him the

07:08.318 --> 07:10.881
Distinguished Servant's Cross. Now that's a 
pretty impressive award. What makes it even more

07:16.347 --> 07:22.435
impressive is this guy was a conscientious 
objector. He never carried a weapon. But yet he

07:26.079 --> 07:28.642
still felt obligated to serve his country. What he 
always told me was he could never be a

07:30.744 --> 07:35.410
conscientious objector in any other country. I 
wouldn't let him do it. but this country was so

07:36.567 --> 07:40.190
great and so tolerant that they would let him. He 
felt he owed that country something, but while he

07:40.210 --> 07:53.722
couldn't in all good conscience bear arms against 
another human being, he'd go out there and try to

07:40.210 --> 07:53.722
save and help American lives and he did that. He 
did. Now, I feel more strongly towards that

07:58.807 --> 08:06.574
conscientious objector who at least went to help 
his fellow American than the conscientious

08:07.145 --> 08:14.614
objector who abandoned his country and went to 
Canada and only came back when it was safe.

08:18.158 --> 08:21.002
Do you understand the difference?

08:23.425 --> 08:25.828
Did you ever feel that the war should end? Did you 
ever feel that Americans should pull out? Yeah,

08:28.871 --> 08:34.418
after we won it. the 70s, early 70s, in the 
beginning of the 70s. Did you agree with the

08:39.625 --> 08:40.927
pullout? Well, you're asking a professional 
soldier to make political judgments. I couldn't

08:46.135 --> 08:48.398
really do it. I left the Army. After Vietnam, it was 
a drawdown. They didn't need as many people in the

08:52.945 --> 08:55.229
Army. They had a million and a half people. 
Congress mandated that the Army be reduced by 50%.

09:06.477 --> 09:09.280
There's issues for them, so I was released. They 
called it a reduction of 40. How did that make you

09:10.962 --> 09:13.504
feel when they discharged you? That was more 
traumatic than combat, I want to tell you, because

09:13.524 --> 09:17.408
I had to reorient my whole life. I was 33 years old. I 
had to find a new career. Did you feel resentment

09:22.213 --> 09:24.075
then towards the Army? No, not towards the Army. 
Like they had used you? No, no, not towards the Army

09:27.119 --> 09:29.361
at all. No resentment towards the Army. I love the 
Army today. I still love the Army. And every day I

09:35.873 --> 09:40.801
still draw upon those things which I learned in the 
Army. Every day. My resentment was towards the

09:42.364 --> 09:50.096
Congress, because they mandated that the 
military be reduced, and I lost my job. Just like a

09:50.116 --> 09:51.719
layoff for General Motors.

09:55.746 --> 10:00.193
But that's okay, because in the Army I learned to be 
resilient and to adjust to change. So I took my GI

10:01.237 --> 10:08.225
Bill, which I earned and I went to college and to law 
school and then became a lawyer. How did you, when

10:10.288 --> 10:15.654
America decided to pull out, did you feel that that 
was right? Yeah, at that time it was because the

10:15.854 --> 10:22.061
American people had lost the will to wage war.

10:25.245 --> 10:26.607
Nope, that was a good decision. You know why? Why? 
There's no point in engaging in a war Because the

10:29.823 --> 10:31.525
American people are not committed to it. You're 
just wasting lives. So, no, it's like gambling.

10:36.550 --> 10:40.574
When you're on a losing streak, you don't throw 
more money on the table. I hope they catch it back.

10:42.176 --> 10:44.038
The American people don't want to fight a war no 
more. Fine, let's pull the boys out of there and

10:44.578 --> 10:46.720
bring them home. That's a good decision. Okay. How 
did you feel? Did you watch on TV when the North

10:49.503 --> 10:53.067
Vietnamese took over Saigon? Mm-hmm. How did you 
feel then? I wasn't surprised. Were you sad? No.

11:01.092 --> 11:02.674
They were filling a vacuum that we left. The South 
Vietnamese had no ability to maintain a war like we

11:04.257 --> 11:11.447
were.

11:11.467 --> 11:17.977
Remember, the North Vietnamese never gained 
control of that country until after the last

11:11.467 --> 11:17.977
American left.

11:24.627 --> 11:28.112
In our class, we heard about a man whose got 
permission from both governments, the

11:28.379 --> 11:43.819
Vietnamese government and the United States 
government, and they're planning trips, like

11:28.379 --> 11:43.819
groups of 12 veterans to go back to Vietnam to help 
build the country back, build schools and

11:28.379 --> 11:43.819
hospitals. Do you have any desire to do that? No. 
Okay. Is there any reason? Take those 12 veterans

11:51.469 --> 11:53.792
and send them to Appalachia. Send them to an Indian 
reservation. We'll send them to a ghetto in South

11:57.522 --> 11:59.585
Bronx.

12:02.949 --> 12:07.214
I mean, take care of your own first and then go over 
there and fool around with those people. I mean,

12:07.234 --> 12:10.739
they're doing that for their own edification, not 
for those people. If they're so concerned about

12:11.199 --> 12:18.369
helping humanity, there's plenty of it right in 
their own backyard and they go 10,000 miles away.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.271
Do you have any desire to ever go back there? I just 
did. You mean to Vietnam, though? I just did. You

12:24.937 --> 12:25.858
went to Thailand. Yeah, that's right next door, 
and I flew over Saigon. How did that feel? It was

12:30.493 --> 12:32.135
interesting. No, no, I forgot how beautiful that 
part of the world is. Really gorgeous.

12:41.667 --> 12:54.563
You know, it's funny, when I already owned 
Vietnam, even in the middle of firefights and

12:41.667 --> 12:54.563
bombs going off and people dying, I would say to a 
couple of buddies of mine, I'd say, you know, this

12:41.667 --> 12:54.563
is one hell of a beautiful country. If there wasn't 
a war going on, maybe, just maybe, this could be the

12:55.218 --> 13:05.333
vacation capital of the world. Gorgeous beaches, 
beautiful mountain ranges, and everything's so

13:05.934 --> 13:13.164
green and so lush. And the Vietnamese people are 
really sweet, darling people. Tough,

13:17.851 --> 13:24.921
hardworking, very cultured, very proud of their 
country, very nationalistic. Smart, creative,

13:26.099 --> 13:37.993
charming, well-mannered, and that's both sides, 
north and south. It's all the same culture. And

13:40.576 --> 13:52.731
I've often thought that, but for all the screwing 
around politicians, which is what that war was,

13:40.576 --> 13:52.731
what a wonderful place it would be to visit. Yeah, I 
think you once told me about a trip over there that

13:53.487 --> 14:00.082
your school was going to participate in as a 
sponsor. I'd rather wait until

14:02.427 --> 14:10.005
maybe things are more settled, but yeah, it's a 
beautiful country. It's gorgeous. Pearl of the

14:11.809 --> 14:12.711
Orient. Back to something you just said. You said 
that the people were sweet and kind. There was a

14:18.604 --> 14:27.117
tendency for some soldiers to look at them as less 
than human, as monsters, gooks, you called them,

14:18.604 --> 14:27.117
you used to call them. Did you ever feel like that? 
Oh, gooks, slopes, slant eyes, chinks, dinks, you

14:28.640 --> 14:33.929
name it. Sure. Just like we call the Japanese Japs, 
yellow bastards. The Germans will call Kraut or

14:41.075 --> 14:43.798
the Bosch. You always characterize your enemy in 
derogatory terms. But some of the best Americans

14:48.464 --> 14:54.412
we have today are the Vietnamese who have come here 
from Vietnam. So you have nothing against

14:54.432 --> 14:57.736
Vietnamese people? Oh, no. They're wonderful 
people. Even the North ones. They were fighting

15:03.524 --> 15:08.550
for what they believed in, and they fought very 
hard, and a very, very great sacrifice. And they

15:08.810 --> 15:09.411
were soldiers. a hell of a good soldier to put up 
with the enormous losses that they did. Because

15:16.440 --> 15:21.004
every time they came up against us, they lost and 
they got really hurt bad, but they kept on coming.

15:21.024 --> 15:25.188
You respect that as a professional and another 
professional. Tough people, good people.

15:28.531 --> 15:34.577
Opportunists like Jane Fonda, you can never 
really appreciate because they just take

15:28.531 --> 15:34.577
advantage of the situation for their own ends. But 
no, I have a, Tremendous respect for the

15:40.762 --> 15:43.024
Vietnamese people. Wonderful people.

15:47.229 --> 15:48.370
Want to qualify one point? Okay. Some of the best 
Americans we have here today are the Vietnamese

15:50.492 --> 15:55.057
Americans. Hardworking, diligent, loyal to 
their family and to the community and to the

15:55.077 --> 16:00.303
country. And they did that all after landing here 
with nothing in their pockets and not even know how

16:01.564 --> 16:08.912
to speak Latin.

16:12.672 --> 16:17.518
What do you feel about the memorial that was put up 
in Washington, D.C.? Good. By damn time. Do you

16:20.021 --> 16:20.882
think... I'd like to go see it. Some people have 
objections to it being black and so down to the

16:21.864 --> 16:27.871
ground and kind of out of the way. That's the most 
significant memorial in Washington, D.C. right

16:27.911 --> 16:31.175
now. More people go to that than anything else. At 
least that's what the people on the television

16:33.558 --> 16:37.123
told me, isn't it? More people go there than go to 
the Washington Monument. Jefferson Memorial,

16:41.225 --> 16:43.169
Lincoln Memorial.

16:47.717 --> 16:51.084
Yeah, that's appropriate then. You know why? 
Because you can go up and touch the names of the men

16:53.348 --> 16:55.613
that served there. It's not just a silly statue or 
some piece of rock sticking out of the sky. It's

16:59.640 --> 17:00.482
real. What that is, is the sacrifice of 50,000, the 
ultimate sacrifice, 50,000 people who truly

17:01.441 --> 17:26.757
loved their country and felt that what they were 
doing was the correct thing and when an American

17:01.441 --> 17:26.757
goes up there and sees it and touches it, then he's 
finally paying tribute to the American men and

17:01.441 --> 17:26.757
women

17:01.441 --> 17:26.757
who served their country

17:28.272 --> 17:52.847
well, affectionately, served their country with 
love and affection for their country, who served

17:28.272 --> 17:52.847
their country

17:28.272 --> 17:52.847
honorably,

17:28.272 --> 17:52.847
and gave the ultimate gift to their country and 
their lives.

17:52.867 --> 17:54.870
Yeah, that's a marvelous memorial.

17:57.770 --> 18:02.876
I look forward to some time going there, maybe with 
my grandchildren. And tipping my hat to my

18:02.896 --> 18:18.933
comrades in arms who didn't have the chance to 
continue their lives after their Vietnam

18:02.896 --> 18:18.933
service.

18:18.953 --> 18:27.743
You know, I find it really hilarious sometimes 
when I talk to a list of civilians, people who have

18:18.953 --> 18:27.743
never served in the military, never been in any 
kind of a situation. I find it hilarious when they

18:28.651 --> 18:40.188
talk about their broken shoelaces and the fact 
that they just can't find the refrigerator that

18:28.651 --> 18:40.188
works well or how they had a blowout on their car or 
some other thing. The only true thing I ever saw in a

18:41.970 --> 18:55.971
movie, Platoon, I think it was,

18:41.970 --> 18:55.971
a soldier was heading home and he says, well, after 
Vietnam, the rest of my life is going to be easy.

18:57.052 --> 18:57.493
That's true. After participating in a war that had 
very little popular support, not having your

18:58.081 --> 19:21.471
sacrifices and the sacrifices of your peers 
recognized, after almost getting killed half of

18:58.081 --> 19:21.471
the time, the rest of your life seemed pretty 
simple, uncomplicated.

19:21.491 --> 19:25.877
And I think the vast majority of Vietnam veterans 
who or women around this country today realize

19:26.330 --> 19:28.612
that. And they're probably not getting a whole lot 
of media attention, but those experiences and

19:30.774 --> 19:43.044
those things which they learned about themselves 
during that conflict are enriching their lives

19:30.774 --> 19:43.044
right now. No war is ever without some benefit 
somewhere along the line. Vietnam is still

19:47.588 --> 19:51.392
different.

19:51.412 --> 19:52.853
Any more questions? No, I don't think so. Thank 
you. You're welcome.
