WEBVTT

00:03.423 --> 00:08.269
And absolutely nothing was geared up for the 
expansion that was facing them. They didn't have

00:08.289 --> 00:20.345
the faculty, they didn't have the facilities, 
they had nothing to adjust for that explosion of

00:08.289 --> 00:20.345
students that they faced beginning in 46. But I was 
fortunate because I had the points to get out of the

00:22.067 --> 00:30.358
service very early. 22nd of September was pretty 
early after it ended. And then number two, I had

00:34.186 --> 00:42.116
completed my pre-professional requirements 
with the exception of one chemistry course or

00:34.186 --> 00:42.116
something. So I came and stopped by and talked to 
Dean Marsteller, showed him my transcript. I

00:48.944 --> 00:51.387
don't know where I'd gotten that. I guess I had the 
foresight to pick that up. But I had my transcript,

00:55.191 --> 00:59.316
showed him what I'd completed. And so, because I 
was out so early, there still weren't, there

01:00.207 --> 01:08.398
wasn't very many people applying at that point in 
time. And because I had all the requirements, I

01:09.379 --> 01:15.427
just walked in school and said, sure, report next 
Monday. Really? So, I did. By the next year or two,

01:18.371 --> 01:23.958
it was, it got very competitive to get in school. 
Because there were only ten veterinary schools at

01:24.739 --> 01:27.102
that time. But, uh, That fall, I didn't have any 
trouble at all. How many classmates did you have?

01:35.959 --> 01:41.568
Well, I had, in the fall of 45, I started with a mixed 
class. I'm going to guess there were about 40 or 45

01:42.349 --> 01:57.051
of us all together, about half veterans and about 
half youngsters, young people that had just

01:42.349 --> 01:57.051
finished the two-year requirement in the Corps. 
Right. So about half that class in the fall of 45 was

01:57.768 --> 02:05.079
veterans, about half were young people. Because I 
remember a lot of horseplay between the two

02:05.099 --> 02:09.045
groups. The veterans were, I was probably one of 
the younger veterans. And I guess I was, what, 22,

02:16.235 --> 02:23.266
23 years old. And I was one of the younger ones. And 
some of the veterans went on up to 30, 35. So it was a

02:32.266 --> 02:35.751
broad range of ages. And of course, the poor kids 
were about 18 in those days. Now, you had the

02:41.698 --> 02:46.725
requirements were done basically two years of 
college. As a matter of fact, on the books, you

02:48.176 --> 02:52.881
didn't even need two years of college. And you 
never did receive a bachelor's degree. What was

02:56.805 --> 02:58.106
your opinion of that? And now what is it as a dean? 
Well, I think we started promoting the bachelor's

03:02.911 --> 03:17.185
degree for students after we could no longer take 
them, all after two years.

03:17.840 --> 03:30.438
when we could take the students after the required 
number of courses, the 66 hours that we have now,

03:17.840 --> 03:30.438
when we could admit them, I think that's a good 
program. But when we started, we had to limit

03:30.458 --> 03:39.892
enrollment, and we could no longer admit all the 
well-qualified youngsters after two years. Then

03:40.493 --> 03:45.180
we had to say, hey, you have to get onto a degree 
program. and complete a bachelor's degree in some

03:46.173 --> 03:55.546
field of interest, whether it's animal science or 
agricultural economics or business or whatever.

03:56.187 --> 03:56.908
Get a degree. Get something. Because you may not 
get into veterinary school, or you may not get in

03:58.290 --> 04:04.378
until you've had three or four years of college 
work. So I believed in the bachelor's degree. I

04:07.823 --> 04:09.565
never did get one, but I just In fact, I tried to when 
I came back here and entered veterinary school. I

04:15.727 --> 04:25.040
took a few more agricultural courses trying to 
qualify for the bachelor's degree by the time I

04:15.727 --> 04:25.040
graduated. But I missed it by, I don't know, 
something like six or eight hours. And it wasn't

04:29.407 --> 04:37.358
important enough to spend another semester. 
Let's talk about the vet school when you came back

04:37.793 --> 04:55.333
in the 1940s, and let's compare not the tangibles, 
like how much it's changed as far as the size, and as

04:37.793 --> 04:55.333
far as the curriculum, we can read that out of the 
documents, but some of the intangibles, like the

04:37.793 --> 04:55.333
quality of instruction. Could you compare what 
you thought was the quality of instruction back

04:55.914 --> 05:02.761
then versus today? Yes, of course the quality of 
instruction from the technical standpoint the

05:09.333 --> 05:16.561
young people today get so much better education in 
the technical aspects of our profession. In

05:17.182 --> 05:26.792
surgery, anesthesiology, the education is a 
thousand times better than what we got. More

05:26.852 --> 05:27.633
resources. The resources are so much better. The 
laboratories and equipment are so much better.

05:32.719 --> 05:33.579
Everything, of course. But, of course, 30 years or 
35 years is a lot of time, too. But From the

05:39.100 --> 05:53.961
standpoint of the

05:39.100 --> 05:53.961
quality of teachers and of the sort of the 
intangibles of veterinary education, I'm not

05:39.100 --> 05:53.961
sure we've improved that much. We had some great 
teachers. We had people like John Miliff who

05:57.446 --> 06:08.061
headed anatomy, Pat Burns who headed physiology, 
Dick Turk in parasitology. August Leonard in

06:08.530 --> 06:10.191
medicine. Great men.

06:17.198 --> 06:21.442
Because our classes were smaller, their 
influence on our lives was greater. They had a

06:22.162 --> 06:28.468
tremendous impact on us as people, as future 
professionals.

06:30.950 --> 06:33.372
I think maybe we've lost ground in that respect. 
Because of the enlargement? Because of the

06:34.433 --> 06:38.537
enlargement and because the youngsters do not get 
as much of the professional integrity as we got

06:39.158 --> 06:49.307
from some of those giants of another era. We have a 
lot of team teaching. And especially under our

06:52.230 --> 07:02.620
accelerated program, where many times students 
really never got to know their teachers that well.

07:04.181 --> 07:06.023
And they missed some things. So on balance, Terry, 
I'd say it's a trade-off. We're doing a lot better

07:11.635 --> 07:19.184
in some areas, but nothing is all positive, just 
like the New Deal of the Great Society, you know.

07:19.524 --> 07:21.206
Nothing's all positive. True. What about another 
intangible, and that is the quality of the

07:21.587 --> 07:29.636
students, your colleagues back then versus 
today? Well, that's, again, a little bit hard to

07:32.019 --> 07:35.743
compare because In the 40s and 50s, most of the 
young, and it was almost all young men, because

07:36.533 --> 07:50.426
women were not on the scene in our profession, only 
to a very limited degree. The young men almost all

07:52.488 --> 07:59.975
came from the family farm, the small farm. Most of 
them had a different background in that different

08:06.217 --> 08:13.405
sense of values, a different approach to life. It 
was pre-television era, pre-nuclear science

08:14.966 --> 08:21.894
era. There was so much difference. We were not as 
well prepared for college, I don't think, at least

08:36.659 --> 08:42.650
Maybe we were as well prepared for what we were 
facing as the youngsters what they face today. We

08:43.271 --> 08:50.223
did not have the in-depth mathematics that I know 
that was always a deficiency I had. I never had

08:51.065 --> 09:01.063
calculus, and I should have had a deeper, much more 
in-depth training in mathematics.

09:03.997 --> 09:19.532
I suppose that the young man and woman of the 40s and 
50s was better,

09:03.997 --> 09:19.532
much more oriented in American agriculture than 
they are today. Now where do you find that most of

09:19.552 --> 09:22.916
your students come from? An awful lot of them come 
from the big cities. Middle America and

09:25.738 --> 09:32.485
modest and large cities. But we receive a lot of our 
students right out of Houston, Dallas, San

09:33.055 --> 09:40.483
Antonio, especially the young women. A lot of them 
come from that background.

09:47.692 --> 09:48.733
I'm not saying it's bad. No, it's different, and 
that's the point. It's

09:51.276 --> 09:55.440
different. Now, let's talk about your favorite 
instructors. Let's talk about some of the ones

09:57.983 --> 10:01.307
that you had in Millock. I've interviewed him. He 
was one of my favorites. He gave an excellent

10:05.393 --> 10:06.514
interview. We had a wonderful time. A giant, 
strong-willed, very great teacher. A good

10:14.283 --> 10:16.807
positive influence. A conservative, very 
conservative man. I'm sure you picked him. But he

10:20.931 --> 10:29.382
was very able, broadly trained, probably one of 
the best educated men that I had. Dick Turk, in

10:32.405 --> 10:47.179
parasitology, a natural wit, a man who, if he had 
not gone to veterinary school, could have given

10:32.405 --> 10:47.179
Bob Hope some trouble as a showman, and one of the 
sharpest natural wits I've ever seen. Excellent

10:49.221 --> 10:49.922
teacher.

10:52.784 --> 11:01.753
Those men were professionals in that they had come 
through the school of hard knocks, and they taught

10:52.784 --> 11:01.753
us A lot about surviving in the real world.

11:09.109 --> 11:11.472
Dr. Burns, I had great respect for him. I did not 
consider him to be such a great teacher. He was very

11:14.938 --> 11:16.019
methodical. I thought he worked a little bit too 
hard to keep students from cheating. That was

11:21.989 --> 11:26.656
always kind of a humorous thing because he didn't 
tolerate anything. He didn't tolerate any

11:27.658 --> 11:30.542
academic dishonesty.

11:33.087 --> 11:40.153
Another man that I had great respect for didn't 
stay here very long after I left. His name was

11:40.193 --> 11:43.396
George Eads. E-A-D-S? E-A-D, I believe. E-D-D-S, 
that's the way he spelled his name. Eads, E-D-D-S.

11:51.123 --> 11:52.744
He's in Florida. He has not retired. Soon will, I 
guess. He taught pharmacology, and he was a master

11:58.309 --> 12:02.773
disciplinarian So many of the Aggies in that day 
dreaded his class and his course because he was

12:04.441 --> 12:12.375
very demanding. But I never had any trouble with 
it. In fact, I sort of enjoyed it because I enjoyed

12:14.679 --> 12:19.468
the subject. His approach to teaching didn't 
bother me, but it did a lot of people. What about

12:25.338 --> 12:26.159
Jaggie? Dr. Jaggie was I don't know. I did not leave 
with as good of an impression of Dr. Jaggi as some

12:30.659 --> 12:38.069
people did, I suppose.

12:40.372 --> 12:50.666
I

12:40.372 --> 12:50.666
did not think he was a bad teacher, but he always 
started off well organized. The first two or three

12:50.766 --> 12:59.338
weeks of his course were usually good, but then 
after that it sort of tailed off. I saw him as an

13:01.073 --> 13:04.117
average teacher. Now did the dean at that time do 
any teaching? Dr. Marsteller's health failed. He

13:10.285 --> 13:12.828
was failing in health when I came back here. I 
didn't realize it, but the next year he went, as we

13:12.928 --> 13:29.410
say in the veterinary slang, he went downhill 
fast, physically.

13:29.963 --> 13:39.638
went on to disabled, became disabled, and was 
relieved of his administrative duties in 1946. So

13:39.718 --> 13:42.943
I never had a course under Dr. Marsteller. Now, a 
lot of my contemporaries did, but I didn't. The

13:47.590 --> 13:58.587
acting dean for the next two years was a man by the 
name of Dunn, D-U-N-N, a pathologist,

13:47.590 --> 13:58.587
microbiologist, and I had courses under him. He 
was an excellent teacher. Remarkable that I had

14:03.028 --> 14:12.619
courses under him in pathology and radiology, and 
they were all top-line. Excellent teacher. And at

14:13.980 --> 14:17.124
that time, the dean taught at least one course? 
Yes. And is that today? Well, I have a course called

14:20.167 --> 14:28.236
an orientation course in just a few, 15 lectures or 
so. And when I can't get time, I sometimes go into

14:29.009 --> 14:36.279
the parasitology laboratory because that was my 
training, parasitology. But I don't do much

14:37.982 --> 14:43.810
because the size of the program has increased. And 
then the thing that just kills a dean and to a lesser

14:44.511 --> 14:54.325
degree department head today is the emphasis on 
accountability. We are constantly reporting or

14:55.604 --> 15:00.952
writing proposals.

15:03.716 --> 15:07.381
Paperwork, the load is unbelievable. I often 
think what it would be like if Dr. Francis or

15:07.401 --> 15:19.519
Marsteller or some of those men came back and had to 
work as dean for a year today. They'd either go mad

15:20.841 --> 15:24.767
or the program would change one or the other. 
because the load of paper is unbelievable

15:25.574 --> 15:30.981
anymore. And there's not very much we can do about 
it. It comes from everywhere. The federal

15:35.387 --> 15:38.270
government, the state government, and the 
university. Basically an attempt to raise money?

15:41.895 --> 15:42.516
A lot of this? Oh, an awful lot of it is a result of 
federal regulations. For example? That start at

15:47.903 --> 15:53.370
every angle, you know, from the, well, The best 
example I would give, Terry, would be to cite the

15:53.907 --> 16:17.015
fact that veterinary schools became eligible for 
some federal support under the

15:53.907 --> 16:17.015
Health Manpower Act, starting back about 65 or 66. 
And then every other year or so, every third year,

16:23.185 --> 16:25.768
There'd be a new Health Manpower Act. So 
veterinary medicine qualified for first a little

16:25.788 --> 16:37.483
federal support under institutional grants and 
then under what we call capitation grants. Never

16:37.503 --> 16:39.486
amounted to a whole lot of money. I don't think 
we've ever gotten more than 6% to 8% of our budget

16:40.547 --> 16:47.436
from the federal government. But that 6% or 8% 
brought an enormous amount of problems of

16:52.936 --> 16:55.680
accountability. Because not only... What did you 
do with that money? Well, we have used it more or

17:00.406 --> 17:05.474
less for enrichment of our programs. We have used 
it to support our Biomedical Learning Resource

17:05.494 --> 17:10.020
Center. You may have visited it down in the 
basement where we have medical artists, medical

17:10.821 --> 17:18.572
illustrators, television... engineers, and so 
on. You'll have to stop by and look at it. We've used

17:24.496 --> 17:26.398
it to support that unit. We've used it a bit to 
support the residency training program that

17:26.959 --> 17:36.890
we've developed in the clinical areas. So it's 
been an enrichment for us. We have not used it to pay

17:38.813 --> 17:43.778
salaries of faculty because we never know. One 
year for the next, we'd have it. So we try to avoid

17:46.461 --> 17:47.783
that. And we've used it to buy equipment, special 
equipment with, do some remodeling with in some

17:49.265 --> 17:55.294
areas. We've used it in a lot of ways, but those have 
been the main ones. But in the process, we've

17:58.979 --> 18:03.024
brought on an awful lot of accountability on 
ourselves. Not only just with... What type of

18:04.086 --> 18:06.690
regulations? Not only with regard to that, but we 
have to... to show from almost every angle that we

18:11.405 --> 18:21.016
are not discriminating against women, against 
minorities, against this and against that. And we

18:21.937 --> 18:26.282
find ourselves just submitting reports all the 
time. And of course, they constantly keep the

18:26.302 --> 18:32.109
hammer over your head. If you don't do it, you lose 
your federal support. Now, I wouldn't want to

18:36.354 --> 18:40.078
imply that it's all federal either. Because 
there's an awful lot of accountability coming

18:40.531 --> 18:50.507
from the state, such areas as the Coordinating 
Board of Higher Education. They'll decide that

18:50.527 --> 19:03.106
you're going to account for this course that 
you're training or this one that you're not using

18:50.527 --> 19:03.106
or this doctoral program that is debatable and 
should it be deleted. And so you find yourself just

19:04.569 --> 19:08.074
once right after the other. And sometimes you 
couldn't really trace it back to the federal

19:09.353 --> 19:30.700
level, but it had been brought on by the federal 
level by a force that they're exerting against the

19:09.353 --> 19:30.700
coordinating board or against the legislative 
budget board or some other group that we live with.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.103
And the result is a heck of a lot of paperwork. A lot 
of paperwork. And then, of course, had a lot of

19:35.223 --> 19:44.172
proposals, because we tried to get money from 
wherever we came. And this has resulted in our

19:44.833 --> 19:52.821
doing some things that we never would have done a 
few years ago. Because of the pressures to gain

19:53.802 --> 20:04.993
admission to the college, we have had to, or do we 
have to, but we elected to, got

20:05.294 --> 20:11.941
a advisory committee to the college. This is a 
16-member advisory board that's made up about

20:11.961 --> 20:31.623
half from practicing veterinarians, and the 
other half come from commodity groups, powerful

20:11.961 --> 20:31.623
political groups in Texas, like the Texas 
Southwestern Cattle Raisers, Texas Dairy

20:11.961 --> 20:31.623
Association, those people. Well, when we got an 
advisory board, then almost immediately we had to

20:35.804 --> 20:39.950
educate that board to what we do. So we had meeting 
after meeting. We had to submit a lot of material to

20:42.133 --> 20:52.727
them to study about our admission system, our 
different programs we have at the college, our

20:42.133 --> 20:52.727
research program, our clinical teaching 
program. Then we had them here repeatedly,

20:53.568 --> 21:00.698
several different meetings, in which we would 
present show and tells of what we're doing.

21:01.098 --> 21:05.524
Because they had to, in order for them to be 
helpful, they had to learn what we're doing. And

21:06.820 --> 21:16.690
then we have a development council now, which is 
another group that we're trying to use to help us

21:06.820 --> 21:16.690
raise monies from private sector. But each time 
you bring those things on, you increase the

21:17.691 --> 21:30.244
paperwork in the needs office by geometrical 
levels.

21:30.264 --> 21:33.287
So we find ourselves spending so much time trying 
to communicate. Some of it is not mandatory. Some

21:36.098 --> 21:38.882
of it we do ourselves because we need we have to do. I 
wouldn't mean to imply that that uncle or somebody

21:40.525 --> 21:51.382
in Washington or somebody in Austin has a heavy 
hand on our necks to report. That's only partially

21:51.402 --> 21:53.526
true. Part of it we bring on ourselves. To compete 
for funds. That's right. And to justify our

22:00.010 --> 22:07.422
programs and build the image of our programs in the 
state. Now let's turn to the University of

22:07.442 --> 22:10.387
Missouri. You left Texas A&M, your first job was at 
Missouri. You stayed there for how many years, a

22:14.054 --> 22:17.419
number of years? 25 altogether, almost, 24 and a 
half. Can you make some comparisons with their

22:21.566 --> 22:26.254
program and Texas A&M? The program at Missouri was 
much, much smaller. After

22:32.195 --> 22:38.621
I went to Missouri, I was in private practice for a 
brief period. And then I went back to the

22:39.482 --> 22:47.449
university as a faculty member, a youngster. Then 
I was gone two different times to graduate school.

22:52.334 --> 22:56.798
Early 1940s, I went to Auburn, and later went to 
Minnesota. And by the time I came back to Missouri,

22:57.537 --> 23:02.105
I enjoyed Missouri. It's a great state, a great 
place to live. A wonderful period of our lives was

23:05.150 --> 23:08.636
there, reared a family there. It's middle 
American ever since, very conservative state.

23:15.347 --> 23:19.714
The name show me is pretty well right.

23:20.723 --> 23:30.638
lived in Columbia at the University of Missouri, 
an old, old university established in 1836, a very

23:20.723 --> 23:30.638
traditional university. The values of academia 
as might be manifested at Harvard or Yale or

23:31.179 --> 23:48.705
somewhere is there because of its age and because 
it had the university tradition we've always

23:48.820 --> 23:55.988
We're kind of amused at Texas A&M because it's a 
Johnny-come-lately to the university realm. It

23:56.088 --> 24:01.694
was a military school prior to 1960, mid-'60s. But 
as

24:03.356 --> 24:10.864
I mentioned, we always went back to Missouri. I had 
the privilege there working under some very fine

24:12.145 --> 24:16.650
people, with some fine people. Again, some old, 
rugged individuals of the veterinary

24:17.339 --> 24:21.584
profession. But Missouri's program was, of 
course, new in 1950, almost. It started in the late

24:28.273 --> 24:29.495
40s. When I went there in 1949 and joined the 
faculty, I think the total size of the faculty was

24:30.736 --> 24:39.347
about 15. And we only took 30 students a year for a 
long time. And even when the faculty got what we

24:45.301 --> 24:55.577
call big, about 30 people,

24:45.301 --> 24:55.577
it was small and conservative. And we had, I think, 
the ability to get to know our students almost like

24:56.738 --> 25:03.348
our children. We usually knew them by first names. 
We knew their wives, how many children they had,

25:06.213 --> 25:11.781
because many of them were veterans in the early 
50s. So it was a very close personal element, a

25:13.583 --> 25:17.387
family-like environment. How about the quality 
of instruction? By today's standards, it

25:21.331 --> 25:23.513
wouldn't be good. By the standards of 1950, it was 
adequate, not outstanding. We didn't have a

25:31.040 --> 25:39.388
research program of any importance until early 
1960.

25:40.280 --> 25:45.386
So it was mostly just a teaching program, and a few 
people were doing a little bit of research.

25:46.467 --> 25:49.872
Today's standards, it wouldn't be good. But 
everything involved, and you can't compare

25:49.892 --> 25:56.960
Muhammad Ali with Jack Dempsey, for instance. 
Exactly. Exactly.

26:01.445 --> 26:04.850
What about your graduate training? Why did you 
decide to go to Auburn, and then why did you decide

26:04.870 --> 26:08.934
to go to Minnesota? Minnesota? All right. I went to 
Auburn because my dean, Dean Holly Groth, had been

26:10.840 --> 26:22.256
at Auburn and had been a director of the federal 
laboratory there. And he knew the young man who had

26:23.537 --> 26:34.953
just gotten his doctor of science degree from John 
Hopkins in parasitology, had a high regard for

26:23.537 --> 26:34.953
him, and he encouraged me to go to Auburn. I did go 
there, and I never regretted it.

26:41.755 --> 26:45.159
I moved ahead a bit as a result of that man's 
influence. Dr. Wilford Bailey, who was my

26:45.199 --> 27:00.096
master's advisor at Auburn, was a young man and was 
full of drive, very progressive, a good

26:45.199 --> 27:00.096
scientist, and he had a good influence on me. So I 
was pleased that I had the opportunity to go to

27:01.097 --> 27:07.965
Auburn. Why didn't you stay there for a PhD? They 
didn't have a PhD program in those days. I had to

27:14.755 --> 27:19.159
have gone to Hopkins or somewhere at that time. So I 
went back to the University of Missouri and worked

27:20.200 --> 27:26.447
for another six or eight years. Then I realized 
that I needed more in-depth training in research,

27:27.267 --> 27:34.695
for research, and I also knew that realize that I'm 
staying there doing the same thing year after

27:35.198 --> 27:41.285
year, slipping somewhat professionally. So I 
looked around for a way to go to graduate school.

27:47.753 --> 27:55.883
Minnesota was well-respected, and I thought in 
those days they had one of the first-rate graduate

27:47.753 --> 27:55.883
schools offered for veterinarians. I went to 
Minnesota because I had a good working

27:56.904 --> 28:03.332
relationship between veterinary medicine and 
human medicine. And I was able to do most of my work

28:04.308 --> 28:11.316
at the medical school at Minnesota, rather than 
the veterinary school. At that time. Strong

28:12.257 --> 28:13.318
research. Mayo influence, you know, was very 
strong. So I went to Minnesota for that reason.

28:22.449 --> 28:29.296
Number two, because they had an arrangement where 
I didn't have to stay the whole time. I could go

28:29.997 --> 28:31.699
there, complete my residency requirements and 
then do my dissertation in absentia. And I had a

28:37.266 --> 28:41.333
good arrangement at Missouri to do my 
dissertation. It was close enough that I could

28:41.353 --> 28:45.760
keep close contact with my major professor. And I 
was able to get a National Science Faculty

28:47.142 --> 28:50.307
Fellowship.

28:52.931 --> 28:58.480
By that time, I had children getting a pretty good 
size and all the family responsibilities. So that

29:00.063 --> 29:01.705
was the reason I went to Minnesota. And what way did 
your graduate training then help you? Yeah,

29:05.910 --> 29:08.753
that's a good question. Because I went to graduate 
school and did my dissertation in absentia,

29:08.773 --> 29:24.732
completed that in 1965, and almost immediately 
went into administration.

29:24.752 --> 29:26.214
Never did do much research. I never, I have no... 
claim to a research career at all. I think the thing

29:33.508 --> 29:45.881
that helped me was it gave me a good respect for 
research and its importance in the educational

29:33.508 --> 29:45.881
process. But I never had any great research 
accomplishments. Never had time. Immediately, I

29:54.110 --> 29:58.875
was named chairman of the department. Well, 
actually, I moved into the dean's office a little

29:59.463 --> 30:08.555
bit before I was named head of the microbiology 
department. And for about five years, I tried to do

30:08.575 --> 30:15.565
both, service head of the department and 
assistant dean, too. And I finally decided I can't

30:16.466 --> 30:18.229
do that. That's not good. Killed you. Killed you. 
So I gave up the department headship in 69, I think

30:22.114 --> 30:28.002
it was. and became associate dean for academic 
affairs. Worked with admissions, curriculum,

30:32.048 --> 30:35.691
instruction. I guess what I loved most that I've 
ever done. I really enjoyed that. Really? Why do

30:42.757 --> 30:43.458
you say that? Because it was still a small program 
and because you could get to know the? Well, I enjoy

30:48.703 --> 30:52.866
veterinary medical education. I believe it's 
important. And those were the areas where I

30:54.208 --> 30:59.052
thought I could get the best feeling and maybe have 
the best influence. There's admission because

31:02.606 --> 31:07.211
your program's never better than the quality of 
young people you admit. Absolutely. And

31:08.633 --> 31:17.483
curriculum is vital because you have to 
constantly struggle to improve the curriculum

31:08.633 --> 31:17.483
and keep it relevant to the needs of the graduate. 
And instruction is so vital because it needs a

31:18.163 --> 31:28.515
constant update if we've increased class size to 
keep the instructors reaching to the maximum. the

31:29.322 --> 31:31.285
young people with the best education. So I just 
feel a very important area. I enjoyed it. I worked

31:34.590 --> 31:36.072
in that area for nine years. And sometimes after 
coming here, I always wished I had a job back. But so

31:42.862 --> 31:46.227
it's very... Well, let's move to this job. How did 
you get it? How did I get it? I don't know. I really

31:52.156 --> 31:54.078
don't know. Did you see an advertisement? I 
never... I never really aspired to be a dean.
