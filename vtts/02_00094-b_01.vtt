00:01.837 --> 00:07.173
Did you ever have a ride with somebody who was driving too fast or drinking a little too much?

00:08.397 --> 00:09.681
No, I guess not.

00:09.741 --> 00:14.817
The most fun I read was being picked up somewhere

00:14.999 --> 00:18.106
probably from Navasota to Conroe, I suspect, is where it was.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.694
And it was a black gentleman in a really old car.

00:22.235 --> 00:26.004
Rattletrap, I guess we called him in the old days.

00:26.264 --> 00:29.732
And we were driving probably 40 miles an hour most of the way.

00:30.093 --> 00:34.122
So it probably took an hour to get to Conroe from Navasota.

00:34.102 --> 00:42.872
But this fellow, whoever he was, was one of those friendly sorts that always had a smile on his face, and he's laughing the whole time, and the windows are down, of course.

00:43.472 --> 00:53.884
And every little bitty settlement we went through from Navasota to Conroe, he knew the people out on the road, waving at him, hollering, ah, honey, hi, sugar.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.606
I'll see you out there in a little while.

00:56.106 --> 00:58.349
And that was really a great experience.

00:58.389 --> 01:01.392
I didn't know people could enjoy life quite that much.

01:01.372 --> 01:02.294
at that time.

01:04.559 --> 01:10.211
Let's see, and you had some Langford reminiscences.

01:10.351 --> 01:17.727
Well, my best story about Mr. Langford, whom I love greatly and respect and admire,

01:18.770 --> 01:33.864
was that Mr. Langford, somewhere, when he was the archivist for the university and I was department head, he would share with me lots of the old dates and things about the university and about the program in architecture, particularly.

01:34.664 --> 01:38.007
And he told me the program was started in 1905.

01:38.468 --> 01:43.052
It was called the Department of Drafting and Technology at that time.

01:43.112 --> 01:45.034
The first graduates were in 1907.

01:45.094 --> 01:48.557
There were two.

01:50.461 --> 01:55.907
Preston Guerin, who's one of the university benefactors, Preston Guerin, Jr.

01:57.168 --> 01:58.350
G-E-R-E-N.

01:58.370 --> 01:58.950
That's correct.

01:59.711 --> 02:05.478
Preston Guerin was, his grandfather was F.E.

02:05.598 --> 02:07.620
Giesecke, and F.E.

02:07.640 --> 02:08.301
Giesecke.

02:08.761 --> 02:12.786
G-I-E-S-E-C-K-E.

02:13.506 --> 02:14.828
That's going to be really close.

02:16.490 --> 02:17.491
Really close.

02:17.511 --> 02:19.573
He was the architect for which buildings?

02:19.958 --> 02:21.621
the architect for the system building.

02:22.843 --> 02:29.313
And I found out many years later, he's also the architect for Norwood Towers over in Austin.

02:30.475 --> 02:33.340
But he was the system architect.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.623
It wasn't a system, I don't guess, in those days.

02:35.663 --> 02:38.748
But whatever it was, he was a campus architect also.

02:39.890 --> 02:43.536
And he, Mr. Giesicki, was the first

02:43.820 --> 02:48.966
head or whatever we called people when this program started as the Department of Drafting Technology.

02:49.006 --> 02:52.730
Mr. Giesecki was the first head of it.

02:52.750 --> 02:56.254
Anyway, he told me a lot of these kind of facts and stories.

02:56.334 --> 02:59.378
And one day, someone had called me on the phone.

02:59.418 --> 03:08.528
Mr. Langford was a gentleman, a distinguished mayor for 26 years and a gentle soul, and we thought just a brilliant man.

03:09.622 --> 03:14.088
And somebody called me and actually wanted some facts.

03:14.889 --> 03:20.617
I don't remember who it was, but I told them the facts as I remembered them, and I think I told them right.

03:22.119 --> 03:32.714
And then I called Mr. Langford, and I said, Mr. Langford, so-and-so's just call me, and they want to know some things, and I just want to check with you one more time, that I'd be sure that I've told them right.

03:35.898 --> 03:37.300
And Mr. Langford said,

03:38.360 --> 03:39.741
God damn it, John.

03:39.802 --> 03:44.106
I'm not going to be here for you to call over all the time.

03:44.426 --> 03:45.848
You've got to remember these things.

03:46.308 --> 03:49.091
And it was the first time I'd ever heard Mr. Langford curse, ever.

03:50.192 --> 03:51.914
And I was blown away.

03:51.934 --> 03:55.678
I just couldn't believe it that he would say these things to me.

03:56.959 --> 04:01.965
Anyway, within five days of Mr. Langford's death, he was up at St.

04:02.025 --> 04:03.186
Joseph's.

04:03.520 --> 04:33.493
and my father came into town, and my father had met him when he brought me down here years before, and he knew who my department head was, so I asked him, I said, Mr. Langford's up at the hospital, and I would like to run up to see him, and my dad said he'd like to go too, so we went up to see Mr. Langford, and he's laying there on his death bed, as it would turn out, and he said, John, good to see you, and we stood there a minute, and a lot of silence went by, and he finally said, John,

04:35.026 --> 04:38.231
What's your best recollection of the first time we met?

04:39.554 --> 04:42.038
I thought, oh, don't put me through this.

04:42.118 --> 04:42.939
Not today.

04:43.140 --> 04:44.582
Come on.

04:44.642 --> 04:53.457
And I said, Mr. Langford, my best recollection is that we met on my Uncle Fred's back porch before I came to school here.

04:55.343 --> 04:56.745
There was this long silence.

04:56.825 --> 04:58.127
I thought, oh, no.

04:58.227 --> 05:00.911
And he finally says, that's my best recollection, too.

05:00.931 --> 05:03.594
I said, thank you, God.

05:03.635 --> 05:04.936
Thank you, God.

05:05.057 --> 05:05.918
I got that one right.

05:06.418 --> 05:07.620
Passed that test, anyway.

05:08.782 --> 05:16.372
Now, what was he like as an instructor, as a teacher?

05:16.392 --> 05:20.899
He was the first dose that my class had at reality, probably.

05:21.019 --> 05:22.701
He taught structures.

05:23.558 --> 05:24.899
And he wasn't an engineer.

05:26.561 --> 05:31.786
In fact, his schooling would have been back in the day when engineering and architecture were basically the same.

05:33.488 --> 05:34.909
And so he was our structures teacher.

05:35.049 --> 05:37.652
And he was a good teacher.

05:38.012 --> 05:39.714
And he taught his structures.

05:39.794 --> 05:41.976
He drew his little beams and things on the chalkboard.

05:42.036 --> 05:50.224
And he said, I've designed a beam, a little old beam, just like this over in such and such a building in Austin.

05:50.204 --> 05:53.569
of one of the capital buildings, one of the major buildings over there.

05:53.830 --> 05:58.256
And we were impressed, one, that he had done that, and two, that he called it a little bitty old beam.

05:58.757 --> 06:01.661
And he was just our first real dose at Reality, and he was a great teacher.

06:01.701 --> 06:14.922
But I was so fortunate that I took that structures course with Mr. Langford, the only one I took with him, in the MSC in the summertime, which was the only building on campus that was air-conditioned.

06:14.942 --> 06:18.507
So it was really an enjoyable class, and we had a great time with Mr. Langford.

06:19.550 --> 06:22.174
Did he seem to enjoy teaching, enjoy students?

06:22.194 --> 06:23.656
Oh yeah, he enjoyed students, yes.

06:24.056 --> 06:31.347
I was standing with Mr. Langford, standing by Mr. Langford in the MSC when I was early in my college career.

06:31.367 --> 06:33.330
I just knew who he was.

06:33.470 --> 06:43.144
I was confident he probably didn't remember who I was, but I was standing beside him when this older gentleman came up from behind him

06:44.710 --> 06:50.275
tapped him on the shoulder, and Mr. Langford wheeled around and said, hey, Joe, good to see you.

06:50.936 --> 06:55.460
And he, I thought, he can call that old man's name that quickly?

06:56.241 --> 07:01.605
And it was Joe Denman from Temple Industries over in Dybal, Texas.

07:01.685 --> 07:02.446
That's who it was.

07:03.407 --> 07:05.289
And Joe was a graduate of this program.

07:05.309 --> 07:06.490
A lot of people don't know that.

07:07.711 --> 07:12.135
But his ability to call former students from the past

07:14.360 --> 07:20.406
They're probably only, no, that's unfair to say.

07:21.027 --> 07:24.551
But there are just three or four that can do that, and I'm one of them now.

07:25.252 --> 07:27.674
I've made it a point to be able to do that.

07:28.675 --> 07:30.537
Remember the names and call them when I see them.

07:30.557 --> 07:35.783
Did Mr. Langford encourage, reckon his example, encourage you to do that?

07:37.265 --> 07:40.468
Well, I might have done it anyway, but it was certainly on my mind.

07:41.748 --> 07:44.311
What are some of your fondest memories here?

07:51.079 --> 07:52.681
You wouldn't think this was a hard question.

07:53.141 --> 07:54.102
This is a hard question.

07:54.763 --> 07:55.944
Fondest memories here.

07:56.685 --> 08:02.372
Well, first of all, I've got to probably say most of them are related to a student.

08:03.313 --> 08:11.282
And by the way, I bet of all these phone calls that I've just returned laying up here, there's not one of them that's not a former student of mine.

08:12.967 --> 08:15.930
One, I see one right there.

08:15.950 --> 08:18.212
Anyway, the former students are the best thing.

08:19.574 --> 08:24.339
And making some lifelong connections, following them with their career.

08:26.421 --> 08:36.572
And after all these years, I've just found out why I have a few good, good boy professional friends.

08:38.393 --> 08:41.877
And I have a number of female professional friends.

08:43.274 --> 08:45.276
And I've always worried about that a little bit.

08:45.496 --> 08:47.398
Just does that mean anything, you know?

08:47.559 --> 08:48.460
What is going on here?

08:48.880 --> 08:50.321
That's always been on my mind.

08:52.083 --> 09:00.112
And the other day I was talking to one of our newer female faculty, an older person out here in the hallway, and she was telling me about this guy that had been to her office.

09:01.133 --> 09:03.235
And she was asking me how I advise people.

09:03.295 --> 09:04.857
And I said, I don't know.

09:04.917 --> 09:09.161
The kids that come to my office very often, we talk about way more than just what class to take.

09:09.222 --> 09:12.505
We talk about their personal situation, their life,

09:12.805 --> 09:17.877
how their family, how them and their mother are getting along, you know, and how they're too many Christmas.

09:18.698 --> 09:19.580
It's really unreal.

09:20.402 --> 09:22.868
And she said, she was talking about this boy that had been to her office.

09:22.888 --> 09:25.093
And I said, well, wait a minute.

09:27.082 --> 09:35.392
There's been no boy that's ever talked to me about their life, their girlfriend, how they're getting along, you know, and things like that.

09:35.672 --> 09:36.754
But girls do it all the time.

09:36.794 --> 09:38.256
The girls must be more verbal.

09:38.276 --> 09:39.557
She says, no, no, you don't get it.

09:39.577 --> 09:41.179
The boys talk to me.

09:41.199 --> 09:44.443
And I said, of course.

09:45.584 --> 09:52.633
A boy to talk to a boy is kind of a sign of weakness if things are not all going, to admit that things are not going well for you.

09:53.407 --> 09:59.034
Yes, that's going to be one of the beauties of the developing female population.

09:59.094 --> 10:08.285
The boys will have a better place to talk and won't feel so intimidated telling it to their mother or some female than they would telling it to somebody that think that's a sign of weakness.

10:09.326 --> 10:18.177
OK, so I now don't feel quite as bad with having so many girls come in here and tell me their life story.

10:18.317 --> 10:19.899
Fun times, fun times.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.502
Romnick had great parties.

10:24.473 --> 10:25.435
that were always fun.

10:25.476 --> 10:38.027
One of the problems with getting larger and being better and as sophisticated as we are trying and have become probably is that you lose a lot of the personal

10:38.834 --> 10:42.258
We used to have faculty parties that were just wonderful.

10:45.121 --> 10:47.323
I mean, we really enjoyed, and we enjoyed each other.

10:47.343 --> 10:50.547
And you can't do that as well anymore.

10:51.167 --> 10:52.829
It just doesn't exist quite the same way.

10:53.730 --> 11:05.342
Partly because we don't develop it, but partly because you find yourself on different sides of the fence more often in competition with one another.

11:05.563 --> 11:07.845
Not just faculty, but departments.

11:07.825 --> 11:11.050
And so there's not as much collegiality, I think, as there used to be.

11:11.531 --> 11:14.455
There's professional respect, I think, generally speaking.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.822
Fun times has got to be the students.

11:18.842 --> 11:19.743
And I love to teach.

11:20.023 --> 11:20.845
I love my classes.

11:22.026 --> 11:25.672
I love to go to school and I love to teach school and have a good time doing it.

11:28.676 --> 11:30.639
I'm looking at these walls and so forth.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.023
Proudest moments.

11:35.382 --> 11:37.325
Things that I'm most proud of?

11:37.966 --> 11:39.790
Well, I'm not a PhD.

11:40.230 --> 11:41.072
I'm not a researcher.

11:42.995 --> 11:51.209
And I realized shortly after I got here, and I first realized I wasn't going to be department head or something else for my whole life either.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.355
So I knew I needed to teach something.

11:55.617 --> 11:58.622
And I could teach architectural design because I

11:59.412 --> 12:13.597
If you go out there and look at my outstanding class hanging over that water fountain over here, my classmates are distinguished professionals that have done some of the world's fine work and heading some of the biggest companies in the world.

12:13.617 --> 12:16.662
But the person that won the design award in school was me.

12:16.895 --> 12:20.519
Not Key Cobb, not Kirby Cahee, not Cecil Stewart, but me.

12:20.679 --> 12:21.060
I want it.

12:22.301 --> 12:32.913
So I could do that, but I didn't want to because I knew from my experience in practice, I can hire people cheaper than I want to be paid to do it better than I can possibly do it.

12:32.973 --> 12:34.975
They're just better teachers at that than I am.

12:36.036 --> 12:41.282
So I knew I needed to, I wanted to develop something and I wanted to be in the business area.

12:42.224 --> 12:49.599
So I did do that, and I developed both courses that I'm teaching, one graduate, one undergraduate, for that purpose.

12:49.619 --> 12:51.663
So I loved them, I developed them, and so forth.

12:52.244 --> 12:57.415
But in order to keep, I realized very quickly that you can date yourself,

12:57.935 --> 12:58.697
Very quickly.

12:58.857 --> 13:04.629
It's not unlike what the publisher of papers and the researcher would be doing.

13:04.649 --> 13:10.422
They're constantly keeping themselves on the forefront and submitting things for review and so forth, and they know they're on the cutting edge.

13:10.963 --> 13:16.635
And the only way for me to know I was on the cutting edge was for me to stay involved with the practitioners.

13:16.615 --> 13:21.079
And to know that I'm not giving out stale information, that's a death knell.

13:21.119 --> 13:29.047
The minute the kids and they find they can determine it real quick that you're teaching stale stuff, was for me to be involved.

13:29.067 --> 13:35.974
So that's what you see on most of these walls, involvement with the professional community, which I've enjoyed immensely.

13:37.075 --> 13:45.323
And my first major thing that was just very special was

13:46.737 --> 13:49.700
Well, I got the practice thing done in Texas.

13:50.041 --> 14:02.515
That is to say since 1937 when they first did a law that regulated the practice of architecture, in fact it didn't regulate the practice of architecture, it regulated the use of the title architect.

14:03.316 --> 14:09.403
It's what the state would call a title law instead of a practice law that said you can or cannot do this.

14:10.008 --> 14:18.303
And for 50 years, the architects in the state tried to get that law changed to say, we need to regulate more than just the title, but who can do this and who can't.

14:18.323 --> 14:20.407
Not just who can call themselves one, but who can do it.

14:21.629 --> 14:25.757
And in 1989, I got that done single-handedly.

14:26.158 --> 14:26.879
Not single-handedly.

14:26.919 --> 14:28.903
Nothing's done single-handedly, but I was the chair.

14:28.943 --> 14:31.307
I was the leader of the effort that got it done.

14:32.182 --> 14:33.504
And it had been tried for a long time.

14:33.544 --> 14:35.086
So I take great pride in that.

14:35.126 --> 14:41.794
And nearly a whole row of those awards there are from people saying, thank you for doing that.

14:43.676 --> 14:48.402
One of the principal reasons I was able to do that is because I was in academe.

14:48.422 --> 14:52.186
I could work on it Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

14:53.167 --> 14:59.455
And the persons that were presidents of the Texas Society that are practicing can't give it that kind of time.

15:00.228 --> 15:00.829
But I did.

15:00.849 --> 15:01.469
I could.

15:01.730 --> 15:02.791
I worked on it all the time.

15:03.151 --> 15:11.599
And I'm assuming you could, on that matter, you could be looked upon as being comparatively unbiased, unprejudiced.

15:12.080 --> 15:12.280
Yeah.

15:12.460 --> 15:13.642
I wasn't a practitioner.

15:13.662 --> 15:13.802
Yes.

15:14.342 --> 15:16.685
That's the one time, very few times that you can say that.

15:16.705 --> 15:24.232
In fact, I was invited to stand for election to the presidency of the Texas Society of Architects on two previous occasions.

15:24.272 --> 15:25.233
And I turned them down.

15:25.313 --> 15:29.037
I told them I really don't believe in a full-time educator ought to be the leader

15:29.017 --> 15:32.181
testifying over in Austin on behalf of practicing architects.

15:32.282 --> 15:33.363
I think it ought to be a practitioner.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.768
And the third time they asked, I said, okay, all right.

15:37.288 --> 15:38.851
And we managed to get this done.

15:38.951 --> 15:41.114
So you were president in?

15:41.134 --> 15:41.334
88.

15:41.354 --> 15:41.975
88.

15:42.035 --> 15:44.178
And the legislature met in 89.

15:44.358 --> 15:47.583
And I carried the effort through the 89 period.

15:48.464 --> 15:49.185
And then

15:50.262 --> 16:00.771
The proudest things, probably, well, let's see, when I was elected to the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects in 91, I think it was.

16:01.452 --> 16:02.793
I can't see the date on that thing.

16:05.936 --> 16:18.987
When Governor Bush appointed me to chair the architecture state board, and I served as the chair for five years, the longest serving chair ever, because used to, prior to Ann Richards,

16:20.198 --> 16:24.364
The chairs were elected by the board, and they elected a different one every year, usually.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.909
So no one served more than two, and most only one.

16:28.389 --> 16:34.939
But Ann Richards got the legislation passed that lets the GOV decide who's going to be the chairman of the state agencies.

16:35.019 --> 16:37.903
And so the GOV appointed me as the chair when I was a freshman.

16:37.923 --> 16:42.850
The first board meeting I ever went to, I was the chairman and stayed chairman for five years.

16:42.910 --> 16:44.672
So that was kind of a proud moment.

16:45.734 --> 16:48.838
It was a proud moment when the American Institute of Architects president

16:49.325 --> 16:57.322
excited me from my activities singularly just three or four years ago.

16:57.342 --> 17:02.052
I'm also, of course, proud of the Distinguished Teaching Award.

17:02.072 --> 17:06.321
I was terribly proud to be in the first class of the

17:07.027 --> 17:21.306
of the alumnus of the college to be recognized, so that I was recognized along with Ernest Langford, and Willie Pena, and a bunch of people whom I have great, great, great respect.

17:21.573 --> 17:25.537
And then I won the Pitts Award, another very proud moment for me.

17:25.577 --> 17:28.320
That's the highest award the Texas Society gives any member.

17:29.541 --> 17:38.471
And let's see, there are just an awful lot of much older and much more distinguished people than me that haven't received that award.

17:39.652 --> 17:41.214
Any sad moments?

17:41.794 --> 17:42.135
Yeah.

17:42.956 --> 17:45.478
Well, you don't want to know personal ones, do you?

17:45.498 --> 17:46.760
No, no, no.

17:46.780 --> 17:47.641
A&M sad moments.

17:47.821 --> 17:49.082
A&M sad moments.

17:50.699 --> 17:54.204
Yeah, we lost to Oklahoma.

17:54.224 --> 17:56.387
When we lost to Texas when they were ranked number one.

17:58.450 --> 18:00.193
We didn't lose, we won that game too.

18:02.175 --> 18:03.798
No, sad moments, sad moments.

18:04.679 --> 18:07.303
Yeah, the death of my colleagues is a sad time, of course.

18:08.905 --> 18:11.589
Trost and McGillivray have died in the last year.

18:14.112 --> 18:14.793
That's not good.

18:14.813 --> 18:16.015
Stasel's got cancer.

18:17.429 --> 18:24.201
I've got two more questions for you then.

18:24.381 --> 18:25.043
Three questions.

18:25.964 --> 18:38.847
As you look back on all these years, what did you learn as an A&M student that has been significant to you as a professional?

18:40.295 --> 18:43.158
Leadership, responsibility, honor, integrity.

18:43.919 --> 18:45.401
Of course, I learned some of those at home, I think.

18:45.441 --> 19:02.539
But there's something seriously to be said about the disciplinary boundaries and the, what do you call it, the recognizing whoever's sitting in the chair is the boss.

19:03.520 --> 19:08.125
It doesn't matter that they're your brother or your younger brother or whatever, whoever's sitting in the chair is the boss.

19:08.493 --> 19:20.771
And being a player in the game, and it's basically a game, but being a contributing player, I think the Corps of Cadets had a lot to do with that.

19:23.055 --> 19:31.528
Because for people of my generation, as I said, when my father said, I think you ought to try architecture, I never gave it a second thought.

19:31.608 --> 19:32.509
I did it.

19:32.827 --> 19:45.624
So, but to have this sort of discipline at that particular moment in life I think was terribly important and gave, I think, one of the most important things that you have to do is to have confidence in yourself.

19:45.644 --> 19:50.690
And one of the things that that helps you do is develop you to a position of having confidence in yourself.

19:52.793 --> 19:54.936
And if you have confidence, you can probably do it.

19:57.008 --> 20:01.192
And so that was part of my college experience, and I think it was terribly important.

20:01.672 --> 20:04.695
It was also part of my Army experience, and I think that was terribly important.

20:06.016 --> 20:18.888
And to understand that just because somebody salutes you, that they're saluting your position, not you, or it's not personal.

20:19.708 --> 20:20.309
It's okay.

20:20.870 --> 20:21.350
It's all right.

20:21.450 --> 20:22.511
No, you're not a God figure.

20:22.531 --> 20:23.832
You're just an ordinary guy.

20:23.852 --> 20:25.834
You happen to be an officer in the Army.

20:27.704 --> 20:28.806
Okay.

20:28.826 --> 20:33.917
What has it meant to you to be an Aggie?

20:33.937 --> 20:34.980
What has it meant being an Aggie?

20:37.325 --> 20:38.888
It's a good camaraderie thing.

20:38.928 --> 20:39.549
It's fun.

20:39.569 --> 20:45.021
I find people with whom I associate

20:45.406 --> 20:49.291
And I've sat on our national board for three years, so I've seen people from all over the country.

20:49.892 --> 20:56.160
Most of those people at this point in time know where this place is, know what it is, and envy it.

20:56.740 --> 20:58.062
They envy the camaraderie.

20:58.102 --> 21:04.350
They envy the association of former students and the dedication people have back to the university.

21:06.693 --> 21:09.296
And I know that.

21:10.578 --> 21:12.460
That's been fun.

21:12.963 --> 21:26.328
If you had the capability to make a very large gift, financial gift, to Texas A&M, and you could decide the use of the gift, for what purpose would your gift go?

21:27.370 --> 21:31.377
I'd try to think of something inspirational like Romanek did.

21:31.508 --> 21:41.251
He gave one to fund a traveling fellowship of some significant amount of money, two $7,000 a year traveling fellowships.

21:41.311 --> 21:47.104
And the only stipulation is this, you must travel in the Pacific Rim.

21:47.911 --> 21:48.832
Not Europe.

21:48.852 --> 21:50.774
You ain't going over and see that old architecture anymore.

21:50.794 --> 21:51.935
I want you to go to the Pacific Rim.

21:52.035 --> 21:52.936
That's where the future is.

21:53.777 --> 22:02.246
And so we now have two people a year going over and making the circle, generally speaking, in the Asian countries and Australia and places like that.

22:03.787 --> 22:04.808
That's a forward-looking thing.

22:04.848 --> 22:06.650
I think I'd try to find something like that.

22:06.730 --> 22:11.395
And as a matter of fact, I have given, my wife and I have given a fairly substantial amount of money already.

22:12.616 --> 22:17.361
And we have given it to this college.

22:18.067 --> 22:24.195
And we've actually given the option to the college of how to use the money.

22:24.475 --> 22:29.662
Whether it's scholarships or faculty awards or travel fellowships, it does not matter.

22:30.863 --> 22:33.387
Whatever the department thinks, but one of those things.

22:33.427 --> 22:35.950
Can't be used for partying, but one of those kind of things.

22:37.692 --> 22:45.542
I said I was a leader on that foundation for 12 years.

22:47.125 --> 22:48.146
that I gave the money to.

22:49.287 --> 22:54.873
And it's given to the Texas Architecture Foundation, and it's stipulated directly to Texas A&M.

22:54.893 --> 23:03.101
It goes no place to Texas A&M ever, ever, ever, unless that thing defaults, and then the money goes to Texas A&M.

23:03.541 --> 23:07.965
But there's an endowment over there, and I get no credit for it at Texas A&M.

23:08.466 --> 23:10.768
That's worrisome to me.

23:11.349 --> 23:12.349
So I did give it to A&M.

23:12.390 --> 23:14.131
It just didn't come directly to A&M.

23:14.512 --> 23:17.014
A&M's going to get it every year forever.

23:17.838 --> 23:20.041
And I wish there was some way to recognize that.

23:20.101 --> 23:30.677
I stayed, when we started this big development campaign 10 years ago or whatever it was, I bugged our, I hired Colonel Ray.

23:31.098 --> 23:32.780
He's our development officer for several years.

23:32.881 --> 23:35.004
I hired him when I was up there.

23:35.244 --> 23:45.820
And I bugged him until he began to put an asterisk like Roger Marris' thing, you know, put an asterisk beside him and say, this wasn't given to him, but it did come here and it comes here every year.

23:47.099 --> 23:58.579
So if I had any more to give, I probably wouldn't give it to the Corps, although I have great respect for that institution.

24:00.842 --> 24:04.669
But the only reason I wouldn't give it to the Corps is because that's where so many other people

24:05.662 --> 24:09.006
I don't think they're going to have a great problem raising money.

24:09.426 --> 24:11.468
I think the little colleges have a greater problem.

24:11.929 --> 24:19.017
That's why I've looked inwardly in this regard, and I probably would again, if I do it again.

24:19.817 --> 24:20.438
Last question.

24:21.379 --> 24:23.481
What are your feelings about Texas A&M today?

24:26.845 --> 24:29.288
It's still an awfully good place.

24:29.788 --> 24:31.450
We still get awfully good students.

24:32.645 --> 24:41.436
And I'm going to have to say a few things about the greatest dean of faculty this institution ever had, Haskell Monroe.

24:42.858 --> 24:52.851
When Haskell said one of the greatest things about this place, and still does exist, is that you better be careful what you say in class because people are going to be taking notes.

24:52.871 --> 24:55.294
And they're going to quote it back to you.

24:55.915 --> 24:58.199
So you better tell them up front, this is a joke.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.042
Don't write this down or something.

25:00.583 --> 25:06.192
No, the kids come here with a purpose, even today, even yet.

25:08.035 --> 25:15.628
I've got kids roaming around out here in the hallway with earrings every place imaginable and tattoos around.

25:17.819 --> 25:24.433
and old baggy clothes, and look like they just came out of some slum someplace.

25:25.615 --> 25:30.145
And then they're in class, and they're taking notes, and they're looking, and they're attentive, and they know what they're doing.

25:30.546 --> 25:31.608
It's wonderful.

25:31.708 --> 25:32.430
It's just wonderful.

25:32.831 --> 25:38.663
So over 30 years or so, you get to watch a whole bunch of different generations change.

25:38.643 --> 25:39.865
But they're all the same.

25:39.945 --> 25:41.387
They really haven't changed.

25:42.248 --> 25:47.915
I think secondary education is doing less of a good job today than they used to, which makes it harder for us.

25:48.556 --> 25:52.762
And the way we've dealt with it is, generally speaking, we've dumbed down just a little bit.

25:53.983 --> 26:08.042
When I teach, I'm giving quizzes over there to a section of 50 tomorrow, and I can't give that section written essay kind of questions because I can't read them all.

26:08.022 --> 26:13.488
And I can't spend a whole lot of time, because if I read them, I can write a declarative sentence.

26:14.409 --> 26:16.692
I can make the syntax right.

26:16.892 --> 26:19.776
I can get the subject and verb agreement and things like that.

26:19.836 --> 26:22.259
And I sort of expect them to be able to do that too.

26:22.759 --> 26:37.236
And when I do give my graduate class essay questions, and I do do that because I feel like they deserve a little bit different and better, and I do read them with that kind of critical eye, I'm usually disappointed that they have

26:37.975 --> 26:41.320
They have more trouble spelling than even I, and I'm not the world's greatest speller.

26:42.502 --> 26:49.193
And they have to work at making a sentence, be a real sentence.

26:49.213 --> 26:52.880
So that, what was the question?

26:53.701 --> 26:54.983
How do you feel about it?

26:55.544 --> 26:56.906
I was really meaning your affection.

26:57.367 --> 26:59.410
Oh, do I still like the place?

27:00.272 --> 27:01.494
How do you feel about it?

27:01.594 --> 27:04.759
Yes, I still like the place.

27:06.140 --> 27:09.546
I understand all the reasons, but we've gotten too complicated.

27:09.586 --> 27:20.004
I'm not sure we can ever go back, but we've gotten too complicated, it's too hard, and we depend way too much on quantitative things.

27:20.605 --> 27:26.915
Reducing people to a decimal point number is just not right, just hopelessly wrong.

27:27.677 --> 27:29.700
And what worries me most about that

27:30.254 --> 27:42.087
It worries me most right here in this college because we teach subjective stuff and then we come over here and want to put people in little number piles, but the university

27:43.096 --> 27:44.358
has a similar problem.

27:44.418 --> 28:01.005
And it seems to me like when you watch people at the department level and the dean's level, and I've been in those two, and then at the upper levels, and the salary goes up each time, that the salary is going up each time because they're responsible for more things.

28:02.447 --> 28:07.275
And part of that responsibility ought to be making the hard calls, the judgments.

28:09.117 --> 28:10.740
And we

28:10.973 --> 28:11.836
And I've seen it happen.

28:11.896 --> 28:13.400
It happens down in the courthouse, too.

28:14.484 --> 28:18.215
You can't even get judges to make judgments anymore to make a hard call.

28:18.315 --> 28:23.852
They will fight it, find any way they can get away from it, make some little old narrow thing.

28:24.608 --> 28:31.838
And I think that disappoints me in our society, not just Texas A&M University, but our whole everything is that way.

28:31.879 --> 28:34.162
And I think we're better than that.

28:34.643 --> 28:35.904
I don't think that's our best hour.

28:36.325 --> 28:37.407
But you still love the place.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.588
Oh, yeah.

28:38.608 --> 28:44.937
It's still done more for me than I've done for it, by a long shot.

28:45.558 --> 28:46.640
Yeah, I still like the place.

28:47.301 --> 28:47.762
Let's quit.

28:47.842 --> 28:48.402
Nope.

28:48.423 --> 28:49.664
Nope.

28:49.684 --> 28:50.365
You started safe.

28:50.385 --> 28:51.527
And I will.

28:52.081 --> 28:57.467
Continue to, even though I have lots of things I could complain about and think could be done better.

28:58.150 --> 28:58.733
I still love it.
