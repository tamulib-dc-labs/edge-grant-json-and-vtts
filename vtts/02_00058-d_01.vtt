WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:08.427
Roll for a short time after Simpson retired before I came here.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.150
I guess there's a little gap in there.

00:10.230 --> 00:14.456
I think Simpson maybe had been semi-retired or something the year before I came even.

00:14.516 --> 00:21.145
But anyway, Howard Perry held that for an interim period there until I came here.

00:22.373 --> 00:29.703
But no one, you know, really fully explained to my satisfaction what that position was.

00:30.744 --> 00:34.048
General Simpson, I think, had a much better feel for it than anyone else.

00:34.509 --> 00:42.119
He had done some of the negotiation with the faculty senate and others regarding this position.

00:45.303 --> 00:48.567
But he told me that, you know, in a way I would,

00:49.357 --> 01:00.396
was like a dean on certain matters, that that's the academic role, that's the academic chain, and that I reported up to the provost.

01:02.468 --> 01:10.802
But again, you know, nobody said much about that, and I found that most of my business was done over here on the core side through Student Affairs.

01:11.123 --> 01:12.966
That's where all the problems occurred.

01:14.148 --> 01:20.820
The discipline problems, the pranks, and all of that, of course, was worked through the Student Services side.

01:21.401 --> 01:26.890
But anyway, General Simpson helped get me squared away on all of that.

01:28.912 --> 01:41.771
I would say, you know, my time was probably 85% on this commandant side and 10% or a little more maybe over here on the head of the School of Military Sciences.

01:42.712 --> 01:46.097
I didn't find anybody else on campus that really understood that.

01:46.998 --> 01:52.827
I'm not even sure any of the, well, when I would go to see the provost,

01:53.752 --> 02:03.623
And later the, and he kind of deferred to the dean of faculties, I believe, on that for me to meet with.

02:04.163 --> 02:09.629
You know, I found they really didn't know what I was doing and what this was all about.

02:09.649 --> 02:11.371
It was kind of a mystery to them.

02:12.452 --> 02:21.201
Now the presidents that you reported to were Mobley?

02:21.221 --> 02:22.763
Vandiver for Dr. Vandiver.

02:23.806 --> 02:29.595
And Dr. Mobley, Dr. Gage, and Dr. Bowen.

02:29.675 --> 02:30.016
And Dr. Bowen.

02:30.036 --> 02:30.536
Those four.

02:31.258 --> 02:32.199
Right.

02:32.219 --> 02:36.466
And the provost?

02:39.130 --> 02:46.661
A fellow that... Richardson was here.

02:47.122 --> 02:47.743
Yeah.

02:47.763 --> 02:48.724
Herb Richardson was here.

02:48.745 --> 02:49.225
Herb Richardson.

02:49.506 --> 02:51.028
He's one I met with that...

02:51.683 --> 02:55.808
But he became the chancellor, it seemed like, not long after I came here.

02:55.828 --> 02:57.309
Was Gordon Eaton in there?

02:57.409 --> 02:57.630
No.

02:58.050 --> 02:59.051
Or Eaton was already gone?

02:59.232 --> 02:59.472
Yes.

02:59.592 --> 03:03.597
I'd heard a lot of good things about him, but I didn't serve under him.

03:03.997 --> 03:06.660
Let's see, then the dean of faculties, Clint Phillips.

03:06.780 --> 03:07.301
Clint Phillips.

03:08.482 --> 03:11.926
He was one I, and the fellow that went over to Egypt.

03:15.029 --> 03:15.590
McDonald?

03:15.610 --> 03:16.111
McDonald.

03:16.131 --> 03:16.771
Don McDonald.

03:16.932 --> 03:18.153
Don McDonald.

03:18.173 --> 03:21.657
He was the one that I first remember talking with.

03:22.430 --> 03:34.563
He was pretty new in there, I believe, at the time, but he's one that I'm not sure had been fully briefed by anyone else what this head of the School of Military Sciences was all about.

03:35.644 --> 03:48.358
He was, you know, a pleasant fella, but he kind of deferred on down to...fella now, tall.

03:49.519 --> 03:51.021
I know him as well as I know my own name.

03:51.041 --> 03:52.082
Can't call it a good man.

03:52.636 --> 03:53.437
Doing what?

03:53.858 --> 03:56.782
He's an associate provost now.

03:58.224 --> 03:58.704
Bill Perry.

03:58.745 --> 03:59.325
Bill Perry.

03:59.365 --> 04:00.367
Bill Perry.

04:00.587 --> 04:02.930
He kind of told me, well, work through Bill.

04:04.472 --> 04:06.676
And I found Bill very receptive.

04:06.796 --> 04:09.760
He succeeded Clint Phillips as dean of faculties.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.363
First, Clint Phillips.

04:13.385 --> 04:18.492
Clint, a good man, but I'm not sure he really...

04:19.180 --> 04:23.864
understood this role that I had as head of the School of Military Sciences.

04:25.766 --> 04:40.759
But Bill Perry, I found him, not that Clint and these others weren't receptive and have listened to me, but I found Bill Perry very, very helpful and willing to get involved with us.

04:40.859 --> 04:42.060
Very highly of Bill.

04:42.461 --> 04:44.202
He's been very good.

04:44.903 --> 04:48.546
Describe John Colvis as the Chief Student Officer of Texas A&M.

04:49.808 --> 05:07.407
I think I have a little of that on the tape back there somewhere, so I may be repeating myself a little bit, but John, from the first time I met him, seemed to be a very special kind of person, very understanding, very compassionate, very people-oriented.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.092
Did he have any pet peeves?

05:15.375 --> 05:16.997
John was a very even,

05:18.344 --> 05:20.786
Very even man, very even tempered.

05:20.846 --> 05:26.752
And one of his few avocations was golf.

05:27.253 --> 05:27.553
Yes.

05:29.715 --> 05:32.098
He loved to play golf and talked about it.

05:32.118 --> 05:37.563
He was a big family man, talked about his family a lot, his wife.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.306
But he was on the job 24 hours a day.

05:41.627 --> 05:46.512
Just one thing I remember very well.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.136
refused to pass all the work to someone else.

05:52.417 --> 05:58.225
And perhaps that was a weakness, I mean, that he didn't delegate more because it caused him to work a lot harder.

05:58.686 --> 06:01.850
And John never made excuses for having to work.

06:01.890 --> 06:11.723
I never heard him complain about it, but I know he'd come to work at 6 o'clock in the morning or earlier, and he'd write all these letters and things and do...

06:12.192 --> 06:21.283
do things that a lot of executives would assign someone else to do, but he was big on doing those things himself.

06:23.005 --> 06:26.790
Not one that passed out a lot of extra work for people to do.

06:27.431 --> 06:30.695
Didn't send a lot of memos and stuff like that.

06:31.276 --> 06:34.099
Very accessible.

06:39.057 --> 06:48.150
You know, I've called him in the middle of the night, and you know, that's the easiest person I've ever seen to call in the middle of the night, as far as being understanding.

06:49.852 --> 06:51.895
That's a marvelous compliment.

06:53.858 --> 06:57.743
You know, I'd apologize sometimes for having to call him about something in the middle of the night.

06:57.763 --> 06:58.725
Oh no, no.

06:59.325 --> 07:04.052
How good a match, I think I know the answer to this, how good a match was John Koldis

07:05.517 --> 07:11.644
for what was needed as Texas A&M's chief student officer.

07:14.487 --> 07:25.920
Well, I can't go back quite when he came, and I'm not familiar with the exact situation, but from all I've heard, you know, he was an excellent selection and match for that.

07:25.940 --> 07:35.271
I can't think of anybody who would have done any better in the role that he had to play here down through the years.

07:35.909 --> 07:43.347
He was dead serious about his interest in students and wanting to bring out the best of them and make sure that they had opportunities.

07:46.975 --> 07:48.940
Very approachable.

07:49.105 --> 07:50.828
Students could come see him.

07:50.848 --> 08:05.930
I think he set the pace, and I think a lot of others have watched him over the years and tried to copy some of his traits, the way he deals with students, and others as well, but very kind and gentle.

08:11.378 --> 08:13.662
I had another story there I was going to mention now.

08:13.682 --> 08:14.523
It slipped my mind.

08:14.984 --> 08:15.925
About him?

08:16.526 --> 08:17.087
Yes.

08:20.358 --> 08:31.693
But he worked long hours, never turned down an invitation, had a great relationship with mother's clubs, never turned down an invitation to go speak to a mother's club.

08:31.733 --> 08:36.199
I remember one thing he told me, Tom, you know, you need to go to those things if you can.

08:37.141 --> 08:47.715
And I traveled with him some, going to some of those, and we had good experiences, but later I had a lot of opportunities on my own to go speak to mother's clubs, but John was...

08:48.151 --> 08:49.795
was super with those people.

08:49.816 --> 08:54.809
He always seemed to find time to do all this, but it meant that he worked a lot of hours.

08:55.732 --> 08:58.580
And he'd come in on Saturday morning and catch up.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.430
His philosophy, and I agree with it a lot, I had a

09:03.710 --> 09:08.119
I went to a commander's conference one time, and the chief of staff of the Air Force was there.

09:08.199 --> 09:16.156
We were all senior commanders, but he was giving us a speech after dinner one night and giving us what to do and how to do our business.

09:16.196 --> 09:19.002
He said, let me tell you guys, you don't need an office.

09:20.686 --> 09:24.897
He says, you know, during the daytime, you're out where all the problems are.

09:25.057 --> 09:29.508
You're going from place to place and you're dealing with issues and problems.

09:29.548 --> 09:36.265
You're letting people know you're interested and you're finding out what the problems are and you take your paperwork home with you.

09:37.578 --> 09:40.281
You do, you know, what you have to do, you do early and late.

09:40.781 --> 09:44.905
During the daytime, you're out where the action is and where the people are.

09:45.886 --> 09:51.652
Now, that's a little bit of an exaggeration, and he knew it too, but he was making a point of which I think is very good.

09:53.234 --> 10:04.125
You know, the daytime is when the things are going on and when you can, if you're sitting there behind a desk spending most of your days as a chief operating officer,

10:05.624 --> 10:08.638
I think a lot of time it's the wrong place to be.

10:09.442 --> 10:13.159
Now during those years, Bob Wyatt was the chief of campus security.

10:13.199 --> 10:14.706
What was it like to work with him?

10:14.922 --> 10:41.672
real pleasure absolute pleasure uh... bob's the funniest guy one of the funniest guys i've ever seen and he does this summary i guess he still does it but uh... he does a monthly summary of all of the incidents and things that are called into security down there and he puts a funny twist on each one of them and it was hilarious reading that every month and some of them i could identify but he didn't use names but

10:41.652 --> 10:46.261
I can identify because I remember when that one happened.

10:47.403 --> 10:54.357
But Bob did some great work for us on some of the incidents and problems we had.

10:54.677 --> 10:59.526
He was very skilled at handling these things.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.412
And ceaseless energy.

11:02.797 --> 11:04.019
Is that right?

11:04.039 --> 11:04.479
Oh, yes.

11:05.020 --> 11:05.941
Always upbeat.

11:06.462 --> 11:07.222
Always upbeat.

11:08.124 --> 11:11.728
Anytime you call him, he seemed to have time for you.

11:11.748 --> 11:21.300
And I remember working some pretty tough cases with him, some that ended up in the courts and lie detector tests and on and on.

11:22.181 --> 11:25.245
But Bob was always very helpful.

11:26.506 --> 11:27.167
Never

11:28.548 --> 11:34.818
pretended he didn't have time to listen to you or hear your problem or think it was ridiculous.

11:36.160 --> 11:44.674
I just think that we're very fortunate here at A&M to have had Bob Wyatt as our head security man.

11:45.035 --> 11:46.116
He knows his business.

11:46.717 --> 11:48.059
He has a way with people.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.767
Another thing, I remember a series of meetings

11:53.928 --> 12:10.071
Back in 91, I believe it was, when we had all the issues involving women here, we had several complaints from women about discrimination, and some of them made the papers big time, and Dr. Mobley appointed a committee to look into all of this.

12:11.312 --> 12:20.746
And we had countless meetings up there on the 10th floor, or what is it, 11th floor, whatever it was, 11th floor, I guess it was, conference room up there.

12:20.766 --> 12:23.850
I don't know how many meetings I attended up there.

12:24.438 --> 12:28.503
going over these things and what are we going to do and how are we going to handle this.

12:30.005 --> 12:36.093
Bob was always a participant there, and I thought he probably offered better advice than anyone.

12:37.094 --> 12:40.698
And he could relate to everyone on the staff from the president down.

12:40.779 --> 12:41.640
He had an O.A.

12:41.700 --> 12:44.303
with them like no one else I've ever seen here.

12:45.380 --> 13:10.408
very smooth very respected but he could get his input in and he was always very honest about what he said you didn't have to kind of turpid or guess what bob meant he he was very honest in anything he reported some people kind of gloss over things or they'll put up a spin on it that uh...

13:10.675 --> 13:31.570
that's not 100 percent honest but that's not bob but he's been a delight to work with and any events that we had that we required security help and all always most forthcoming i've been involved in early on here and and i and i would like to talk about that please just as a matter of record

13:31.651 --> 13:54.891
When I came here in 87, inundated with everything that was going on and the ceremony of the fall football season, march-ins and visitors coming, parents, students and all, and every place I'd go around to visit, I'd find closets stuffed full of trophies and old plaques that go back to the 30s and 20s even, drill teams and

13:54.871 --> 13:57.595
RVs and just all kind of things.

13:57.615 --> 14:00.839
But they were all rusting away in closets.

14:00.899 --> 14:13.276
And then when we'd have distinguished visitors come to look at us or visit with us, we didn't have a single place that I felt comfortable taking them in the Corps I'm talking about.

14:13.877 --> 14:21.688
We had an old guard room that had been run down, dusty, muggy, moldy smelling.

14:21.888 --> 14:24.454
I just didn't feel comfortable taking anyone there.

14:24.575 --> 14:30.289
Certainly, the facilities we had in the Commandant's Office were not that good.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.417
And it occurred to me that

14:33.700 --> 14:39.951
You know, maybe in 10 years, it would be nice if we had some kind of a visitor center museum.

14:40.432 --> 14:49.449
Here are all these trophies and honors and things that we've won, the rich history of the Corps, and it's nowhere displayed really in one place.

14:50.150 --> 14:53.937
It'd be nice to have some kind of a facility.

14:55.570 --> 15:08.724
And then, you know, to have some place that could use for meeting room or distinguished guests to come and look, be the focus for recruiting, that sort of thing, I thought it'd be nice to have that kind of facility.

15:09.385 --> 15:13.649
I'd visited other places even before I came here and seen some of this.

15:14.090 --> 15:16.993
Seemed like most places did have some kind of a visitor center.

15:17.473 --> 15:23.620
I remember being at the Air Force Academy and, gosh, what a nice visitor center, quite a tourist attraction.

15:23.785 --> 15:25.988
And I just remember that in the back of my mind.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.330
I've been to West Point and seen some of their stuff.

15:28.391 --> 15:39.404
And, you know, we got a rich history here, but we really don't have it open to and put together in any way that people can really see or something that we can use.

15:40.305 --> 15:46.252
And the more I thought about that, the more I said, this is something we really need here.

15:46.392 --> 15:53.100
But in the back of my head, I said it'd take at least 10 years to bring anything like that to fruition.

15:53.317 --> 15:58.707
And I got involved with the Core Development Council, a group that had been formed a year or two before I came here.

15:59.208 --> 16:03.876
Had some few prominent people as members of this Core Development Council.

16:04.958 --> 16:11.730
And I think it was within a year after I came here, we were having a Core Development Council board meeting.

16:12.655 --> 16:16.521
And I was giving them my little report on the status of the Corps.

16:17.603 --> 16:21.729
And there were only about, you know, 12, 15 people all together in the room.

16:22.831 --> 16:32.386
And I said to them, you know, gentlemen, and there was one lady, ladies and gentlemen, lady and gentlemen, there's an idea I'd just like to throw out to you.

16:32.627 --> 16:35.912
It's my dream that in 10 years,

16:36.044 --> 16:45.094
We might have some kind of a visitor facility that we could show off some of the history of the Corps and we could welcome visitors and do all that kind of stuff.

16:45.474 --> 16:50.860
I gave them a little more than that, but just a dream and a vision that I have.

16:52.422 --> 16:54.965
And there wasn't any real discussion.

16:55.065 --> 16:57.327
It was a short briefing that I'd given them.

16:57.347 --> 16:58.809
It was just one of several points.

16:59.550 --> 17:05.376
Well, that night they had a cocktail party over at the Hilton for all of the Corps Development Council and their wives.

17:05.727 --> 17:08.891
You know, there's 60, 70 people there all together.

17:10.193 --> 17:15.701
And one of the members that heard me that day, Harvey Cash, I don't know if you remember that name or not.

17:15.721 --> 17:15.901
Sure do.

17:16.682 --> 17:18.484
Class of 33, I believe he was.

17:18.524 --> 17:23.411
But Harvey, a very distinguished fellow, been with Texaco, had made gifts to A&M.

17:24.192 --> 17:29.239
But he's a strong core supporter, very good friend of John Colas, John Meridale.

17:29.259 --> 17:32.123
But we were standing there at that...

17:32.626 --> 17:42.839
cocktail party that evening and Harvey came up to me and he said, Tom, let me tell you, you know, I agree with you on that idea you have about that visitor center.

17:43.620 --> 17:45.662
He says, I think we ought to pursue that.

17:46.904 --> 17:49.907
You know, he just jumped on and supported that idea 100%.

17:51.890 --> 18:00.220
And he said, you know, I think here in the next, I believe he said 15 minutes, we ought to be able to

18:01.347 --> 18:04.071
get $500,000 committed to this project.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.196
Well, I said, wow.

18:07.537 --> 18:10.221
You know, I thought to myself, I thought, what are you talking about?

18:11.563 --> 18:17.092
And he said, yeah, we need to call some of these folks into the conversation here and get some commitments from them tonight.

18:19.596 --> 18:23.562
Well, he called Ken Huddleston, Buddy Seawall.

18:25.886 --> 18:27.068
Seemed like there was another one.

18:29.933 --> 18:31.395
and was escapes me at the moment.

18:31.455 --> 18:38.122
But anyway, Harvey said something about he would start it off, he would give, seemed like it was 100,000 himself.

18:38.582 --> 18:40.064
He'd commit 100,000 to it.

18:41.245 --> 18:53.098
Well, we didn't get 500,000, but within 10 minutes, I saw at least three people commit gifts that would total over 250,000 to this project, which sounded like a lot of money to me.

18:54.139 --> 18:57.983
And I was just going, wow, I can't believe what's happening here.

18:57.963 --> 19:03.775
But they all agreed that this was a worthy project and they would support me on this thing.

19:03.855 --> 19:13.795
And so it became my responsibility then the next day to, you know, report to John and others, you know, what had heard and what had happened.

19:14.247 --> 19:18.692
And suddenly I found myself the leader of a campaign.

19:19.352 --> 19:20.654
And you know, how do we fund it?

19:21.154 --> 19:23.196
You know, starting from scratch.

19:23.216 --> 19:24.938
How do you get a project like this approved?

19:25.339 --> 19:34.188
I was fairly new at the university and I learned all about facilities and planning and planning committees and all of this.

19:34.829 --> 19:42.617
But it became my job and my mission to get that building built, to get it funded and built.

19:43.238 --> 19:47.810
And everyone I talked to was so supportive of that when I'd brief them on the concept.

19:48.673 --> 19:53.024
Bob Walker down at the foundation, he jumped on, yeah, you know, Aggies will give to this thing.

19:53.064 --> 19:54.107
How much is it going to cost?

19:54.147 --> 19:54.769
We didn't know.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.353
It's going to be a good bid.

19:56.823 --> 20:06.037
But we had to first get the regents to prove this thing, and you know, I had to draft minute orders and do all of these things.

20:06.538 --> 20:17.295
You know, I was solo on this thing pretty much with their support, but there was nobody in the commons office knew anything about how to proceed with this idea.

20:17.748 --> 20:30.189
And it was part of my dream and vision anyway, so I was glad to take the lead on this, but I got the opportunity to work with the foundation, with Bob Walker, with Facilities and Planning.

20:31.010 --> 20:34.035
Ed Peel, when I briefed him on it, he jumped on it.

20:34.505 --> 20:34.926
Great.

20:35.026 --> 20:38.853
He was extremely helpful getting this thing.

20:38.893 --> 20:42.961
He even built a POR and all this just right off the bat on his own.

20:44.544 --> 20:52.800
And anyway, we went to the regents and briefed them, and the regents thought it was a good idea where you're going to put it, and we told them where we wanted to put it.

20:53.185 --> 21:19.193
and people said well you're going to be taking green space there you know we don't want to lose green space and they said maybe we better look at where we're going to put this thing again so we hired a consulting firm to come in and look at locations and they confirmed where we thought where it is down there now yeah that's a good place you know how are we going to get this thing funded uh bob walker was very helpful and uh

21:19.662 --> 21:26.497
Bob one day called me on the radio and said, Tom, meet me up in front of the building in five minutes.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.340
I got Dr. Sam Sanders with me.

21:29.683 --> 21:31.427
And I said, I want you to meet him.

21:32.065 --> 21:38.574
Sanders had the gun collection over at MSC and that started a new relationship right there.

21:39.195 --> 21:43.061
I could talk 30 minutes about Dr. Sam Sanders and that relationship.

21:44.663 --> 21:50.732
We went over at the MSC and sat down and had coffee and talked a while and we talked about the gun collection.

21:50.712 --> 22:01.690
Maybe the idea of moving the gun collection, it being a centerpiece in this new visitor center, and Sanders seemed interested in all this, and we had several meetings and all, and this worked.

22:02.832 --> 22:13.429
He became very supportive of the idea and agreed to do roughly a million and a half gift toward this building, which he did later make good on.

22:13.449 --> 22:14.290
He sold some.

22:15.451 --> 22:17.955
He gave us a piece of land, I think, which we sold later.

22:18.075 --> 22:22.743
But anyway, his was roughly a million and a half commitment to the building.

22:23.044 --> 22:26.149
And that gave us the real go-ahead on the thing.

22:26.850 --> 22:29.775
And we arranged to get a line of credit.

22:29.855 --> 22:34.202
We thought it might take us four or five years to raise all the money for this thing.

22:34.182 --> 22:39.250
But we got a line of credit to prove through the foundation to go ahead and press on.

22:39.711 --> 22:42.795
We got an architect involved and went through all of those steps.

22:43.476 --> 22:47.282
And, you know, we were, well, you know, we'd like to have this in there, this and this.

22:47.362 --> 22:52.410
And long story, we ended up with that building done.

22:52.846 --> 23:01.824
And I think we only made one or two interest payments before gifts overtook it all and we never had to pay a bit more interest.

23:01.844 --> 23:04.169
That line of credit was really unnecessary.

23:04.650 --> 23:10.382
About how long was it from the night that you described the dream

23:10.885 --> 23:12.907
until you all moved into the building?

23:12.927 --> 23:17.031
We moved into the building, dedicated on September the 12th, 1992.

23:17.412 --> 23:22.697
We actually moved into the building, started moving in about February, March of 92.

23:23.658 --> 23:26.381
It took roughly... Five years?

23:26.801 --> 23:29.063
15 to 18 months to construct.

23:29.204 --> 23:30.705
But how long was it?

23:31.266 --> 23:35.610
When did you mention that this is an idea that I...

23:36.029 --> 23:39.915
I'd say it was sometime in 88, maybe the fall of 88.

23:40.175 --> 23:40.916
So four years.

23:41.757 --> 23:45.603
So about four years from dream to completion and paid for it.

23:45.623 --> 23:46.384
That's marvelous.

23:47.326 --> 23:56.339
Dr. Sanders was a grand Aggie there and I had opportunity to meet him.

23:56.459 --> 23:57.160
I remember

23:58.017 --> 24:00.747
We wanted to do something special for him.

24:00.787 --> 24:08.314
He was about 88 or 89 then and health was failing and he lived up in Memphis, Tennessee.

24:09.340 --> 24:11.763
Did he make it to the dedication?

24:11.823 --> 24:12.684
He did not make it.

24:12.724 --> 24:14.847
We did have a groundbreaking ceremony.

24:14.867 --> 24:17.109
There is a big picture down in the Corps Center.

24:17.530 --> 24:20.213
Shows all of us with our shovels, and Dr. Sanders was there.

24:20.233 --> 24:27.942
He was visiting the campus one day, and we hurriedly arranged a ceremony to have a groundbreaking ceremony so we could get him.

24:27.962 --> 24:30.325
But it's a classic picture down there in the Corps Center.

24:30.785 --> 24:34.690
It has several people in there, Ed Peel, Mobley, Dr. Mobley.

24:35.193 --> 24:38.657
Dr. Sanders, Bob Walker, myself, and I don't remember.

24:39.137 --> 24:41.299
I think Bob Smith, Robert Smith may have even been in there.

24:41.339 --> 24:41.820
I don't know.

24:41.900 --> 24:49.248
But anyway, we did get him here for that, but he went downhill after that.

24:49.348 --> 24:59.378
We did in that December, last time I saw him alive, Dr. Mobley and Dr. Bill McCord were

25:00.083 --> 25:06.389
out on a capital campaign visit to visit with a fellow that was head of the Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville, Tennessee.

25:07.530 --> 25:13.356
And on the way back, we were in, Bob Walker was with us, and we were going to stop in Memphis to have breakfast with Dr. Sanders.

25:13.776 --> 25:20.363
We wanted to present him a scroll that the regents had proved and some, a football sign and some things.

25:21.364 --> 25:25.568
And I tagged along with him, and I went on this visit.

25:26.324 --> 25:32.595
there in Knoxville, Tennessee, and we were flying on Bill McCord's Jetstar, which is a pretty nice way to travel.

25:33.336 --> 25:40.448
Bill McCord, I don't know if you remember him or not, but he headed that last capital campaign, one of the chief fundraisers there.

25:40.509 --> 25:51.808
But anyway, we flew on to Memphis the next morning and met Sanders and some of his, two or three of his staff people there at the airport, had a nice visit, made these presentations to him.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.795
And he was so receptive.

25:54.855 --> 25:59.180
But a man that was so kind and gentle, you can't believe it.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.463
Just as white-haired as he could be.

26:01.624 --> 26:10.696
But he came to A&M, lettered on the, he was a high jump champion, Southwest Conference high jump champion, did some other athletic things here.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.320
But he was encouraged to go to Tulane to medical school.

26:14.461 --> 26:17.965
He was a football coach that, I guess it was DX Bible, maybe.

26:17.985 --> 26:18.826
I forget who it was.

26:18.847 --> 26:22.251
They encouraged him to go to medical school.

26:22.501 --> 26:24.645
And then some way it didn't work at Tulane.

26:24.665 --> 26:27.289
He ends up at Tennessee, I guess it is.

26:27.309 --> 26:31.195
But he became a well-known allergist in Tennessee.

26:31.616 --> 26:35.402
But he refereed all the major bowl games sometime in his life.

26:35.462 --> 26:36.945
He just had all kind of interest.

26:37.646 --> 26:41.472
But he died that next spring.

26:41.603 --> 26:44.686
following that December event we were attended in Memphis.

26:45.327 --> 26:49.471
And Bob Walker and I flew up there and attended his funeral and all.

26:49.531 --> 26:58.239
But Sanders is the guy that gave us the real stroke we needed to make this thing come true.

27:00.181 --> 27:07.048
All the ideas that we had, many were incorporated and some were beyond the scope.

27:07.228 --> 27:11.492
But it was a great thing when it opened.

27:11.877 --> 27:23.193
It was my dream also that we would establish a Hall of Honor there in the Corps of Cadets Center, that each year we would induct a certain number into the so-called Corps Hall of Honor.

27:24.916 --> 27:41.580
So we got that underway and inducted the first ones in 1993, and we've been doing that every year, and it's been a very high ceremony for these people inducted into the Hall of Honor, and that'll come up again this fall.

27:42.100 --> 27:48.166
But, you know, most of those things down there, I lived through it all.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.748
And, you know, I'm just an outsider now.

27:50.989 --> 27:55.894
I go down there and I look at that and I watched every brick almost go up.

27:55.954 --> 28:01.279
I was there on the job every day watching that with great pride and great anticipation.

28:02.380 --> 28:07.725
But I think it's been a great boost for the Corps to have that place.

28:08.866 --> 28:09.627
And...

28:10.045 --> 28:12.489
Those first years, we'd had tremendous crowds.

28:12.569 --> 28:17.015
On football weekends, there'd be wall-to-wall people in there, and they'd just stand around like that.

28:17.356 --> 28:22.743
But, you know, after a while, I get kind of used to it, and it doesn't have the jazz that it once had.

28:23.505 --> 28:32.037
But my concern now is that it needs to be updated, and we had a dream of interactive music.

28:32.017 --> 28:34.861
displays and all of this sort of thing.

28:37.204 --> 28:44.475
You've got to have a vision and a dream for that kind of stuff to make it come true, and then it's got to be maintained.

28:45.096 --> 28:46.778
I learned a lot about museums.

28:46.818 --> 28:48.661
They're not an easy thing to manage.

28:48.681 --> 28:59.256
A lot I didn't know about them, but it's been a good thing, and my only heartbreak right now is that I don't see the

28:59.911 --> 29:02.173
the resources to update it.

29:02.594 --> 29:06.378
There's got to be new carpet and new paint and the bricks have to be kept level.

29:06.418 --> 29:09.862
We started the brick campaign out in front there with the name Bricks.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.203
That was a way to raise money.

29:12.084 --> 29:21.394
And saw all of that develop and seen hundreds of people come there to see their name on their brick.

29:22.095 --> 29:27.761
And through that brick program we've generated now a million and a half dollars in endowment for the Corps Center.

29:27.781 --> 29:28.602
How marvelous.

29:29.172 --> 29:34.778
All right, you helped to bring the Corps to modern days and that.

29:36.079 --> 29:49.093
Are there any, looking in hindsight in those years you were Commandant, are there any oversights that Texas A&M made in the area for which you were responsible, any things we didn't do that now wish we had done?

29:49.133 --> 29:53.678
I don't think of anything.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.786
Oh, I can't say any oversights.

29:59.648 --> 30:05.199
You know, I could say, well, you know, we should have put more money on this or that, but resources are quite limited.

30:05.239 --> 30:12.173
Really, the university has been, in my opinion, pretty generous to the core.

30:12.440 --> 30:21.169
Compared to when I came here, I think support through the university has increased significantly.

30:21.549 --> 30:25.574
A lot more staff than we had back when I came.

30:25.594 --> 30:29.778
A lot of it funded through university or state money.

30:31.019 --> 30:38.447
The scholarship program, Robert Smith, helped us start the Commandant's Leadership Scholarship Program.

30:39.322 --> 30:48.738
And I never will forget when he called me over one day and said, Tom, you know, we got this big pot of money from collegiate licensing.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.746
And he says, I think the Corps is entitled to some of this for scholarships.

30:54.447 --> 30:55.910
It's primarily scholarship money.

30:56.932 --> 31:03.102
But he said, you know, if you could design a scholarship program, how would you do it?

31:04.263 --> 31:08.730
Well, in a short meeting, he gave me a charge to go design a scholarship program.

31:09.271 --> 31:10.012
And I went back.

31:10.092 --> 31:11.915
I jumped all the way back to the office.

31:11.975 --> 31:16.583
I couldn't wait to get started on this because it was going to be a juicy scholarship program.

31:17.404 --> 31:19.808
And it is a tremendous program.
