WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:29.177
If you want to classify, you're either going to be 
involved in the production of a radioactive

00:02.748 --> 00:29.177
substance, if that's your interest, or you're 
going to be involved in looking at the radiation

00:02.748 --> 00:29.177
that comes off the reactor itself, those parts.

00:30.389 --> 00:34.735
The radiation that comes after the reactor itself 
went down in popularity? Only because of the

00:35.876 --> 00:41.644
completion of studies of particle physics.

00:44.828 --> 00:45.629
That was in the early 70s? Yeah, the effort was so 
intense, as I said, throughout the world, that

00:46.089 --> 00:56.303
they progressed very rapidly.

00:56.323 --> 00:59.687
The intensity definitely fell away. Once the 
information is gathered, the basic information,

01:00.528 --> 01:05.873
it has not changed much. Well, you still have 
people looking, and they'll change numbers a

01:07.635 --> 01:11.879
little bit. You'll see a little change, but not 
much of a change. Has the popularity of creating

01:15.803 --> 01:29.877
radioactive material or creating advanced codes 
or activating material, has that changed since

01:15.803 --> 01:29.877
you started? Well, it's changed in the fact that I 
think there's more ingenuity in the use of these

01:30.008 --> 01:38.037
materials, particularly the medical field. 
They're just really on the threshold of nuclear

01:40.320 --> 01:44.665
medicine. It's going to become even more 
sophisticated, more and more uses of these

01:45.566 --> 01:52.474
materials. We're going to see them coming up 
regularly now. Japanese, for example, are doing

01:58.865 --> 02:07.921
quite well in brain cancer treatment with capture 
boron, boron capture work. Whereas in the United

02:09.303 --> 02:12.969
States, we're not that far along. There's an 
interest now. It's starting.

02:18.819 --> 02:23.387
Do you think now is the critical time period in 
medical? I wouldn't say it's critical. I don't say

02:26.254 --> 02:27.055
it's critical. I think nuclear medicine is doing 
quite well. The advances are very, very good. But I

02:33.463 --> 02:39.270
think you may be on a threshold of really breaking 
through and doing a lot of things. You could be

02:39.771 --> 02:43.195
plugging away for a while and now is the time it's 
going to break open. And also, there's more

02:43.756 --> 02:48.561
interest among the medical people. When do you 
think that interest began in terms of what you were

02:49.142 --> 02:53.087
doing? years ago. Nuclear medicine is not, the 
whole field is not that new. We've had experts in

03:00.117 --> 03:10.210
nuclear medicine for many years, but a lot of it has 
to do with the development of good electronics.

03:10.230 --> 03:12.613
Really advanced quite rapidly. Computer-based 
analyses, things that were just too difficult to

03:13.334 --> 03:20.384
do by hand in the early days. Too many numbers to 
handle, too too many things to look at now it's done

03:22.379 --> 03:49.483
so easily with a computer so you can feed back 
information in a diagnostic case feed it into a

03:22.379 --> 03:49.483
computer and it will digest all that information 
and give you a very simple answer I think the

03:22.379 --> 03:49.483
electronics has played just as vital part as any 
because the reactors have always been here. The

03:51.712 --> 03:55.596
radioactive materials have always been 
available. It's just that the technology to use

03:57.338 --> 04:04.245
them is what's really advancing. Now, didn't the 
research going on at the Nuclear Science Center,

04:04.265 --> 04:18.559
wasn't it closely coordinated with the Data 
Processing Center in trying to use the computer

04:04.265 --> 04:18.559
for analysis when it first opened? several of our 
users that become heavily involved with the

04:19.602 --> 04:26.993
computing center. The Activation Analysis Lab, 
the AARL, and now the CTC. They use this facility

04:32.101 --> 04:46.302
mainly for activating their samples, and then 
they count them here, put that on tape, take that

04:32.101 --> 04:46.302
information into campus, and put it on the large 
computers. where they can handle more data, more

04:47.125 --> 05:03.420
information, very quickly and in a more 
sophisticated manner than you could if you're in

04:47.125 --> 05:03.420
the laboratory trying to handle it on a much 
smaller instrument that doesn't have the

04:47.125 --> 05:03.420
capability. Yes, definitely our users get 
involved with the data processors. We get

05:10.126 --> 05:16.592
involved with it when we do studies on our reactor 
for the operations of the reactor. But the air

05:18.631 --> 05:33.890
reactor, you know, as far as use of it for isotope 
reduction and radiation work, the other nice use

05:18.631 --> 05:33.890
of this reactor is training and teaching. You 
know, there's the operations side of it, how the

05:33.910 --> 05:46.326
reactors operate,

05:33.910 --> 05:46.326
training of operators for nuclear power plants, 
the handling of of radioactive materials within

05:47.217 --> 05:58.771
the facility, the hands-on experience of a health 
physicist, the radiation policeman, as we call

05:47.217 --> 05:58.771
him, or them. They can come to this facility, and we 
can let them handle radioactive materials,

05:59.331 --> 06:06.100
something they cannot get in the classroom. How 
has the center been used in education today? Oh,

06:09.964 --> 06:10.985
quite extensively. Has it changed at all? I'd say 
it has. I'd say in the last 10 years there's

06:17.204 --> 06:25.816
considerable more interest

06:17.204 --> 06:25.816
by more departments on the campus. It's nothing 
more than just an introduction. They want to

06:30.682 --> 06:35.669
introduce the student to the reactor and what it 
could do. If it's nothing more than just a tour

06:35.689 --> 06:45.642
where a professor wants to bring his class out, 
we're seeing more and more of that. Because

06:46.786 --> 06:56.475
I guess some of these professors were realizing 
that students were going through A&M and didn't

06:46.786 --> 06:56.475
even know there was a reactor here. Exposure is 
mainly to the experimenter and not directly to the

06:58.017 --> 07:03.782
student. So we, for example, the chemistry, 
freshman chemistry, in one week alone, we run

07:03.802 --> 07:13.591
through something like 600 to 700 students. Just a 
tool. That happens twice a year, and the physics

07:16.655 --> 07:22.581
department does the same thing. These are our 
future researchers. If they know such a tool

07:26.385 --> 07:40.420
exists at that earliest age in their education, 
it's a good chance to keep that in the back of their

07:26.385 --> 07:40.420
mind and know that it's a good tool for the future in 
their studies. And then we have the other

07:41.461 --> 07:44.805
educational application where you you're 
involved in graduate research, the master's

07:45.477 --> 07:52.703
research, or the doctorate research. In that 
case, we offer our facilities and our expertise.

07:59.149 --> 08:04.654
And we will train the individuals in the operation 
of our equipment. And when they become capable of

08:04.674 --> 08:12.501
operating that equipment on their own, we turn 
them loose and they do their own research. But we

08:13.041 --> 08:15.163
are involved in the training of that individual. A 
lot of our graduate students would say come from

08:15.616 --> 08:21.483
life science. Let's take, for example, someone 
who's going to study the uptake of arsenic in

08:21.503 --> 08:29.212
catfish in the rivers. He's going to do it by a 
nuclear method. He's never been around a reactor.

08:32.896 --> 08:34.718
He doesn't know anything about it. So we have to 
take that individual and work with him and train

08:35.199 --> 08:42.147
him on not only how to The instrumentation are the 
counting systems to analyze his samples, but to

08:42.937 --> 08:57.715
give him some idea of what's going on with the 
reactor, why his samples are radioactive, and so

08:42.937 --> 08:57.715
forth and so on, can help him out. Most of our 
experimenters, though, have some background in

08:57.735 --> 09:05.024
working with radiation. We do not handle a large 
number that have just a basic idea and need to be

09:12.670 --> 09:18.356
taken from the very beginning of it, stepwise, 
right on through. Now, they've changed the

09:20.559 --> 09:27.926
hierarchy of who you report to. Is that just last 
year? That has changed. Okay. Well, for many

09:32.531 --> 09:41.361
years, the first change that I recall at the 
Science Center was the changing between Dr.

09:41.543 --> 09:43.685
Cochran and Dr. Randall. Dr. Cochran just 
reverted back to being head of nuclear

09:45.467 --> 09:50.471
engineering. They assigned a separate person to 
be director of the center. It was that way until

09:57.578 --> 10:07.427
just recently, as far as reporting up.

10:08.968 --> 10:10.690
To report entities, we've always usually had some 
administrator there to report to. Harry Whitmore

10:14.540 --> 10:20.186
has been the overseer of this facility for many 
years. He probably can give you a very detailed

10:21.427 --> 10:28.273
history of the administration of the Science 
Center. But when Dr. Porter became director, Dr.

10:29.354 --> 10:38.483
Randall reported to Harry Whitmore again for 
about two years. when Dr. Erdman arrived, took the

10:38.969 --> 10:46.601
place of Dr. Cochran as the head of the department. 
Tease placed Dr. Erdman in the line of

10:46.861 --> 10:52.310
administration. I now report, well, it was Dr. 
Randall first when he was still here. Dr. Randall

10:59.040 --> 11:06.512
would report to Dr. Erdman, would turn, would then 
go to Whitmore and then the chain of command went up

11:07.066 --> 11:11.191
that way to Porter. If you look at the black box in T, 
so to speak, the administrative block, Dr. Ervin

11:11.311 --> 11:23.885
is there now as the head of nuclear engineering 
research. Because the department heads of

11:23.905 --> 11:32.695
engineering are assigned a portion of their time 
into T's for research. And they are the directors

11:32.715 --> 11:35.858
of of research for their particular field of 
engineering. So in this case, they just placed Dr.

11:40.807 --> 11:46.391
Erdman there as the administrator we go for. Has 
that made any difference in your operations at

11:46.671 --> 11:48.893
all? Well, I think it has. I think better 
communications, I think, compared to the last two

11:50.835 --> 11:56.059
years. Communications with the faculty? 
Entities. Entities. And the faculty,

12:01.624 --> 12:06.368
yes.

12:08.626 --> 12:12.872
better progress in keeping in touch with the 
faculty in nuclear engineering. There seemed to

12:13.894 --> 12:17.820
be a period there where we were not in contact that 
close.

12:21.305 --> 12:29.398
Now, the Nuclear Science Center has embarked upon 
a new direction within the last, actually the last

12:21.305 --> 12:29.398
two years we did this. We're now on a very large 
campaign to sell this facility to the university.

12:36.989 --> 12:37.570
We feel that We're not that well exposed. More 
people need to know about us. If the department

12:43.252 --> 13:04.201
heads know more about this facility, then the next 
time they look at a faculty member to come on staff

12:43.252 --> 13:04.201
on board, they may look at that faculty prospect as 
being a potential user of the facility.

13:04.221 --> 13:08.046
Chemistry, there seems to be quite a bit of 
interest It's been being built up over there. We

13:11.730 --> 13:16.554
have several people that are interested in using 
the reactor. It's taken several years to reach

13:16.574 --> 13:21.279
that point. We need more involvement by 
engineering. Materials testing. We do not have a

13:27.325 --> 13:29.567
lot of interest. Did you ever have any interest? 
Yes, there's been material testing interest. But

13:33.811 --> 13:35.232
I mean, it's been rather... Is it small but steady? 
It seems to always depend upon who is at the

13:37.136 --> 13:42.283
university. If this person has that interest and 
he's at the university, then he's going to come to

13:42.303 --> 13:50.214
the center and use it. It's very difficult to speak 
with a researcher who has a special interest and

13:50.354 --> 13:59.346
convince him he needs to change his interest. That 
just doesn't work. The way to do it is to hire him to

14:02.870 --> 14:04.813
do it. bring the type of researcher to the 
university that would use the facility. And

14:12.066 --> 14:15.670
that's our goal, is to work with the 
administrators. Hopefully, that they would

14:17.532 --> 14:22.257
bring these type of people to Indiana. For 
example, right now, Dr. Dan Hightower over at the

14:22.317 --> 14:34.750
vet school would love to see a good radio 
pharmaceutical expert here for the the preparing

14:35.759 --> 14:42.507
of pharmaceuticals

14:35.759 --> 14:42.507
in medical research. But they're basically the 
preparation of radioactive pharmaceuticals.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.777
And they have to be clinically certified and so 
forth. So it's not an easy thing. And there are a lot

14:54.101 --> 15:01.329
of areas that could be researched in medical 
pharmaceuticals. So that's just one example. Was

15:05.695 --> 15:11.383
this something that the Nuclear Science Center 
decided would be happening, or was this something

15:05.695 --> 15:11.383
that came down to you? No, this is TEAS. TEAS has 
asked for studies, I'd say extensive studies of

15:12.805 --> 15:23.841
this facility started about four years ago

15:12.805 --> 15:23.841
by TEAS. Now, TEAS, of course, you've got to 
realize they are a division that's established by

15:25.724 --> 15:35.398
the legislature to provide a research link the 
industry serving the industrial requirements of

15:36.880 --> 15:42.125
the state of Texas. That's done by working with the 
faculty, sharing the faculty with engineering,

15:43.607 --> 16:02.205
yeah, with the college of engineering to produce 
these basic research needs to improve anything

15:43.607 --> 16:02.205
within first the state and then the region. And the 
Science Center is really doing more than just that

16:07.272 --> 16:14.043
type of work, that sponsored research more to some 
extent. Because we're also involved in teaching

16:14.063 --> 16:19.933
and we're also involved in education. And we're a 
multi-use type facility rather than just

16:19.953 --> 16:28.067
sponsored research only. So I can understand why 
TEAS is looking at us in terms of maybe making more

16:34.154 --> 16:37.718
money for them than paying their way and stuff like 
that. That seems to be the real problem within, our

16:37.738 --> 16:43.705
problem within TV journalism. But research 
reactors do not make money. They do not pay their

16:48.350 --> 16:49.871
own money. None of them do. No, they don't. They're 
not that way. They're operated by the university

16:56.719 --> 17:02.946
systems as teaching, training, and research 
tools, and they're They're just an educational

17:03.314 --> 17:09.203
expense and research expense that's realized. 
That's the framework of most of the reactors.

17:13.530 --> 17:14.211
Well, most. Certainly the majority. Is it a 
similar problem to what the data processing

17:17.456 --> 17:22.224
centers have in terms of they will ? I think so, but 
again, it's a... But they're an educational

17:24.487 --> 17:26.971
expense and a training expense. Right. You're 
probably, in your work in interviewing people

17:27.131 --> 17:31.498
with NTs, you will find that their philosophy is 
that they are more than willing to develop

17:32.947 --> 17:39.333
research capabilities. But once those research 
capabilities are developed, good, sound

17:40.434 --> 17:57.169
research projects, as far as they're concerned, 
have enough sponsorship behind that research to

17:40.434 --> 17:57.169
pay for the facility's operation. And that's 
where this facility has a problem. because it

18:04.199 --> 18:12.470
takes specially trained people to operate a 
reactor. So we're a little heavy on the

18:12.490 --> 18:21.982
administrative and engineer side because 
there's quite a bit of responsibility. We're

18:22.002 --> 18:23.845
involved in safety. We have to do everything by 
strict requirements, the regulations that are

18:23.865 --> 18:30.874
established by the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. We must comply with those, and that

18:31.414 --> 18:34.138
takes a lot of our time. We must be aware of any new 
regulations to our administrators. We spend time

18:44.225 --> 18:50.992
commenting, attending meetings, discussing 
things with the NRC. They're a regulatory agency,

18:51.112 --> 18:56.959
and you must have an input. If you do not speak up, 
you're going to be regulated to the point where you

18:57.079 --> 19:02.305
can't do anything. So you have to defend yourself, 
is what I'm saying. And to defend yourself takes a

19:05.928 --> 19:12.396
lot of time. It sure does. Now, back on the 
education side, you must realize too that we do

19:12.816 --> 19:20.285
have the laboratory instruction. Nuclear 
engineering labs are conducted here. These are

19:23.409 --> 19:32.739
usually the type of laboratory where each week the 
student will perform an experiment. It can be done

19:33.981 --> 19:35.783
within a four hour period. either a study of the 
behavior of the reactor, or he may be dealing with

19:36.927 --> 19:53.952
just other things I've been speaking of, an 
isotope production experiment, or maybe even a

19:36.927 --> 19:53.952
beam extraction experiment. Has this always been 
the case in terms of being used as a lab? Yes, it

19:57.557 --> 20:06.090
varies in intensity, again, depending on 
faculty. There are some faculty that would be very

20:06.442 --> 20:12.310
interested in doing the experiments here. And 
then if that course is assigned to a different

20:13.331 --> 20:24.846
professor, there's a good chance that he has other 
ideas or other plans for the course. And he

20:25.126 --> 20:28.451
wouldn't use the reactor as much as the previous 
professor. How do you do nuclear experiments

20:28.471 --> 20:32.376
without a reactor? You don't. Oh, yeah, there are 
laboratories. purchase sources and do... If

20:40.450 --> 20:42.453
you're having your students do labs... Okay, 
they're just doing something different. They're

20:45.357 --> 20:46.959
not getting this knowledge. That's true. They'd 
have to be learning something different. True.

20:56.053 --> 21:01.421
But they can deal with radioactivity in a 
laboratory by purchasing sources.

21:03.344 --> 21:04.005
But... If you're going to study the behavior of a 
reactor, then you obviously must have a reactor.

21:10.021 --> 21:11.483
That's the one thing. Of course, I feel very 
strongly that you're going to have a much

21:11.543 --> 21:30.673
better educated engineer coming out of this 
system in nuclear engineering if he's been

21:11.543 --> 21:30.673
associated with a reactor. Some knowledge of it. 
how it operates, what you can do with him, and the

21:32.977 --> 21:41.489
do's and don'ts in terms of his safety, his 
personnel safety. Because he may be stepping

21:42.209 --> 21:57.590
right into a facility, and if he's had no 
experience or actual training of working with

21:42.209 --> 21:57.590
radioactivity, he may be a weak engineer for a 
while. He may be a little careless about what he's

21:59.212 --> 22:01.836
doing. He may not appreciate the effects of 
radiation on his body. He may do things that aren't

22:09.321 --> 22:11.204
too careful. Or he may be so scared of it, either 
way, it could go either way you want to. So afraid of

22:20.880 --> 22:23.103
it, he doesn't want to do his work. Because we try to 
show the student that if you follow procedures,

22:30.284 --> 22:41.020
and you have a basic knowledge of radiation, you 
can work with it very safely if you're

22:30.284 --> 22:41.020
level-headed and just follow rules. That's 
exactly the way we operate out here. We do

22:43.543 --> 22:47.890
everything by following rules. We operate a 
reactor that way. We conduct our experiments that

22:49.191 --> 22:50.734
way. We have auditing and monitoring of just about 
everything we do. You're talking about... the

23:00.085 --> 23:05.692
highest regulated field of research or industry 
there is. No one's ever died in a nuclear power

23:07.374 --> 23:13.162
plant from radiation. They've fallen off ladders 
and broken arms and legs and things like that, but

23:13.182 --> 23:28.101
the only accidents we've had in the nuclear field 
have been in the laboratories or in experimental

23:13.182 --> 23:28.101
reactors.

23:29.093 --> 23:35.940
Our military is heavily involved in reactors, in 
submarines and surface ships. We've had reactors

23:36.220 --> 23:46.311
that have gone to the Arctic and they're dropped in 
sections from airplanes and they're put together

23:36.220 --> 23:46.311
on the ice. All types of development of reactors. 
The early scientists that were developing

23:52.377 --> 23:57.683
weapons, they've had some accidents. But the 
industry, the nuclear power industry, has not

23:58.760 --> 24:06.652
experienced that kind of an accident, no doubt. 
Has this particular facility had any problems

24:06.672 --> 24:12.621
with ? No. We're very fortunate. We have a very 
understanding community.

24:19.512 --> 24:26.843
People in this community, the state of Texas even, 
if you want to include the whole state, are highly

24:27.785 --> 24:30.869
supportive of research. They just don't have 
that. There's a small group called the Armadillo

24:35.515 --> 24:43.845
Force that have shown some demonstrations at the 
nuclear power plants. But that's only because of a

24:43.865 --> 24:52.095
pickup from what they, you get these ideas from the 
newspapers and the press. But you've not had any

24:52.175 --> 24:55.960
demonstrations here throughout your history? 
No. No? We just went through our re-licensing of

24:57.907 --> 25:06.378
this facility, which continues our license for 
another 20 years. And in that re-licensing

25:06.398 --> 25:14.769
process, our license and our application appears 
in the public document room in Washington. And

25:15.170 --> 25:27.846
there were no interveners, no questions asked at 
all on the material we submitted and what we were

25:15.170 --> 25:27.846
going to do with the reactor. State of California, 
that's a completely different picture. The UCLA

25:31.691 --> 25:38.381
reactor,

25:31.691 --> 25:38.381
they're trying to re-license and they have 
interveners. It's really a mess. It's all tied up

25:41.667 --> 25:47.596
in legal matters now. They're going to shut that 
reactor down during the Olympics for fear of a

25:47.616 --> 25:52.724
terrorist target. The only reason it's a target is 
because it's been in the news. If you broadcast

25:58.049 --> 26:02.914
these things and point them out, then you're going 
to have problems. But as long as you have a very

26:04.195 --> 26:11.103
calm, understanding community, then you're 
okay.

26:11.763 --> 26:25.277
We've had several articles through the years

26:11.763 --> 26:25.277
telling our general public that we're not an 
environmental force or impact at all in this

26:11.763 --> 26:25.277
community. And we monitor that very carefully. We 
have to put extensive reports into the NRC, into

26:28.323 --> 26:39.373
the state of Texas concerning the environment 
that we may have a part of, an effect upon. We

26:40.274 --> 26:47.921
monitor the creeks for any radioactivity, the 
grass, the dirt samples around for several miles.

26:48.781 --> 26:56.068
Monitor the milk at the dairy up here for any traces 
of radioactivity that could to be associated

26:57.027 --> 26:59.450
either with this facility or any other. If you 
compare that to this power plant over here,

27:01.572 --> 27:26.342
Gibbons Creek, that's going to be burning 
lignite, they're going to be puffing all kinds of

27:01.572 --> 27:26.342
radioactivity up that stack of natural 
radioactivity that's been dug out of the earth,

27:01.572 --> 27:26.342
but it's going to be discharged in such a way that it 
comes out of their concentration because there's

27:01.572 --> 27:26.342
uranium in that dirt, in that coal. And that 
uranium is going to go up that stack. So they're

27:31.828 --> 27:40.559
going to have far more environmental impact than 
we would at this facility. Because the byproduct

27:40.579 --> 27:48.269
we have that goes up our stack around research 
reactors, it's a gas. It's contained in air. It's

27:49.651 --> 27:51.113
argon that's in air. And we produce a radioactive 
material any time air gets around the reactor.

27:57.743 --> 27:58.784
because there's argon in there. But the argon has a 
very short half-life. It doesn't stay around very

28:01.467 --> 28:02.628
long. In fact, in a matter of something like five 
hours, it's roughly 90% gone. And we discharge it

28:09.416 --> 28:13.861
at a high altitude. It disperses at a very, very low 
level. In fact, it's so low once it leaves our

28:17.425 --> 28:23.171
facility that we can't even detect it. We must 
detect it inside the facility when it's

28:25.250 --> 28:32.680
concentrated for us to even know that we're 
releasing it. It's that low. There's not a threat

28:34.343 --> 28:37.427
at all. Have you noticed any change in use of 
facilities or attitudes towards the facilities

28:37.447 --> 28:49.985
with administrative changes in the university? 
We didn't see many changes.

28:55.355 --> 29:00.280
Basically until, I'd say, the changing between 
Benson and Porter.

29:03.442 --> 29:08.587
I think that was the most drastic change in looking 
at our operation. I think it's typical of that

29:08.607 --> 29:13.232
administration. They looked, as you said, they 
looked at the data processing center. I'm sure

29:15.674 --> 29:23.421
they're looking at places like the wind tunnel.

29:24.717 --> 29:26.980
In fact, right now, we're under a review. There are 
several considerations that Tiege looks at. The

29:33.367 --> 29:38.693
refueling of a reactor that's been in the 
newspapers. You might have seen the article

29:38.713 --> 29:43.799
related to that. The concerns of the commission 
are that we may become targets of terrorists.

29:49.426 --> 29:52.750
Well, this would bother any administration.

29:54.164 --> 29:58.228
If I were Dr. Porter, I'd be concerned because he's 
licensee. So it's up to me to keep him properly

29:59.129 --> 30:03.693
informed. Because a lot of things you read in the 
newspapers sometimes are scary tactics. If you

30:09.999 --> 30:15.405
know a little bit more about it, you can sit down and 
think it through and be reasonable about it. You

30:16.466 --> 30:17.727
have a better control. There has been action by one 
of the commissioners to try to more or less scare

30:24.337 --> 30:29.865
our administrators into shutting down our 
reactors. He puts out this information that we

30:31.147 --> 30:38.657
have nuclear, we have bomb material in our 
facilities. It's not true.

30:43.604 --> 30:51.595
The terrorists cannot take what we have without a 
considerable degree of difficulty. He would have

30:52.376 --> 30:52.977
to to really work at it, to come up with a weapon. I 
mean, he would have to almost be a major power to do

30:57.673 --> 31:01.859
it. A small nation couldn't do it. It's just too 
sophisticated, too complicated. It's not the

31:09.489 --> 31:10.471
right material. That's the first thing. And 
that's what I tried to point out in my

31:12.814 --> 31:22.407
conversations to the public around why we're not a 
terrorist target. are a theft target of this

31:24.074 --> 31:26.958
field. Research reactors are. As a service 
facility, what does TEAS do for you? What does it do

31:33.306 --> 31:37.171
for us? Well, first of all, it's the parent funding 
we have. That's the main thing. But TEAS has an

31:43.999 --> 31:53.271
interest in serving the university and serving 
industry in Texas. Through that philosophy, we

31:54.365 --> 31:57.308
have a facility that can do that. And that's why 
we've always been a part of TEAS. We have the type of

32:04.776 --> 32:15.206
research facility that's suited for sponsored 
research, government research, industrial. And

32:16.127 --> 32:23.815
if you bring those kind of dollars into the system 
through TEAS, that allows you to place the faculty

32:24.335 --> 32:34.131
member in that budget, some graduate students, 
purchase of equipment, things of that nature. So

32:34.151 --> 32:40.422
if you look at T's side of it, that's what they want 
to do. The

32:40.462 --> 32:50.899
research reactors, in our case, we spend a lot of 
our time on teaching and training. We just do not

32:52.077 --> 32:55.842
have that many sponsored research programs. The 
only way to get them, as I said before, is to have the

32:58.124 --> 33:06.514
faculty members here that can generate that type 
of interest. And it's improving. There's some

33:10.039 --> 33:17.508
researchers now in the Department of Engineering 
that have some very good proposals. I can remember

33:18.889 --> 33:21.072
that sometimes there were no There wasn't a single 
proposal from engineering. Well, back in, I'd

33:26.719 --> 33:38.474
say, mid-'70s or early-'70s,

33:26.719 --> 33:38.474
we were doing most of our work for other 
disciplines. College of Science, we were doing a

33:38.694 --> 33:51.210
lot of geological work, chemistry, 
biochemistry, life sciences, veterinary

33:38.694 --> 33:51.210
medicine, but not much in engineering. If you look 
at the Science Center's position, it's more

33:52.709 --> 34:05.683
oriented to be a university division than it may be 
a TEAS division. But TEAS has always been the

34:05.703 --> 34:09.987
parent administration. This study we're going 
through now,

34:12.050 --> 34:21.940
there have been proposals in these studies that 
say to move us within the university, much like

34:22.713 --> 34:29.463
today's processing center. Look at our funding. 
These are the things that we're working on, Dr.

34:32.367 --> 34:38.476
Irvin and the staff out here. That study's going on 
right now. I don't know how much of it you can

34:41.800 --> 34:48.450
publish or put together. possibly terminate 
before you're through and you can say something

34:49.358 --> 34:52.863
about it. Right now, I can say it's a study. And 
there's several considerations. There's

34:57.610 --> 34:59.533
several things that could affect you. Well, TEAS 
is reevaluating a lot of its programs just to see if

34:59.553 --> 35:08.126
it's serving the way it should be. That's right. In 
this case, it may not be serving as it should.

35:16.779 --> 35:18.201
We may not be serving the tease parent 
organizations based on their philosophy.

35:24.082 --> 35:34.973
Because of the expense of operating the facility, 
they would prefer to operate where we either paid

35:24.082 --> 35:34.973
our way or almost all of it. At least 90%, say.

35:39.158 --> 35:40.039
85% to 90%. Based on that philosophy I gave you 
earlier, once you develop a research capability,

35:41.941 --> 35:48.087
solid sound research practices would be to 
subsidize, or pay for the subsidy of that unit.

35:57.568 --> 36:05.955
Well, data processing around that, getting out of 
T's and becoming state subsidized. That may be the

36:05.975 --> 36:07.917
way we go. Oh, I think so. Definitely, in the 
proposals, there have been statements of

36:09.818 --> 36:17.905
becoming a line item out of state budget. There are 
many things. If the university system feels that

36:23.274 --> 36:37.071
this facility should be operated on a subsidy 
basis, and they want to have the state funded

36:23.274 --> 36:37.071
directly, then that's a way to go. Is there 
anything else you'd like to tell me about the

36:39.594 --> 36:43.859
particular projects you remember here? Oh, well, 
okay. Now, if you want to talk about the The fun

36:48.327 --> 36:50.190
things, yeah. Sure, tell me the fun things. Well, 
the fun thing, I would classify them as the animal

36:51.612 --> 36:55.697
experiments. First, in the early days, I'd say 
late 60s, when we had our first reactor type here, a

36:57.340 --> 37:11.780
lower power than we have now, we were doing some 
goatee radiations. That's Sidney Brown's stuff?

37:13.443 --> 37:14.224
Yes, the goats. And we didn't have the... large 
radiation cell that we have now. And we would

37:21.869 --> 37:32.685
bundle that goat up in a tow sack, just a little 
small bundle, his legs wrapped over his head and

37:21.869 --> 37:32.685
all sorts of things. And then we would shove that 
animal upward in through an opening toward the

37:32.705 --> 37:43.562
reactor, close the door and then bring the reactor 
up for exposure. And then they would bring the

37:44.644 --> 37:46.887
animal out after Of course, we moved away with the 
reactor and cleared the radiation. And then they

37:50.980 --> 38:01.776
would take the animal over to the laboratory next 
door here and had the animal go through an obstacle

37:50.980 --> 38:01.776
course. And the poor thing, once he got out of the 
tow sack, it would take him an hour just to get his

38:01.796 --> 38:08.466
legs back, even if he were well. So I thought that 
was quite interesting. Measurements were not

38:11.391 --> 38:15.777
that accurate at the time. Those became quite 
sophisticated compared to the goats. As we later

38:20.448 --> 38:30.202
started our work with the Brooks Medical Center in 
San Antonio, the irradiation of baboons and

38:20.448 --> 38:30.202
monkeys, mainly monkeys, reesey monkeys. These 
are done in our large radiation cell. Very

38:35.049 --> 38:43.861
fascinating experiments because the animals are 
highly trained and they perform very difficult

38:35.049 --> 38:43.861
tasks. They must perform them very quickly. And 
once they've been irradiated,

38:46.216 --> 39:03.812
provided a lethal dose of radiation, then they are 
monitored for their function, as well as the vital

38:46.216 --> 39:03.812
organs of the body are checked and monitored. And 
it's very interesting to watch those

39:03.832 --> 39:08.056
experiments. Of course, the animal is not allowed 
to suffer a radiation death. This is a laboratory

39:12.760 --> 39:16.003
animal. Our lamb animals are usually put to sleep, 
as they were in the case of the monkeys. And the

39:22.388 --> 39:24.309
baboon is a similar thing. These were studies that 
were being made to determine man's performance.

39:32.717 --> 39:40.624
How would man be able to function after a lethal 
dose of radiation, particularly a military

39:32.717 --> 39:40.624
application. The fighter pilot that It's not 
blown out of the sky, but he receives a lethal dose

39:45.245 --> 40:00.548
from a nuclear warhead or something, or he flies 
through a nuclear radiation field or something

39:45.245 --> 40:00.548
and receives a lethal dose. What do you do? Do you 
bring him back home, or do you let him perform his

40:02.331 --> 40:05.536
mission? That's the information thereafter. The 
other interesting part thereafter, though, They

40:13.645 --> 40:27.244
were trying to determine if there was any chemical 
treatments or injections into the vital organs

40:13.645 --> 40:27.244
that could change their functions once they were 
subjected to that much radiation. So there were a

40:28.205 --> 40:42.184
lot of pre-radiation surgery experiments, 
implants of capillary tubes and injection points

40:28.205 --> 40:42.184
in the animals, particularly the brain. to see if 
they could improve the brain functions

40:43.312 --> 40:53.684
after an exposure like that.

40:53.704 --> 41:00.872
I'd say of all the experiments we've done, those 
are the most interesting, mainly because of the

40:53.704 --> 41:00.872
animals, I guess, and what they could do. They're 
very clever little fellows. It's unbelievable.

41:05.218 --> 41:11.665
And each animal was valued at about $15,000 an 
animal because of the training. Oh, yeah, they

41:12.944 --> 41:19.492
could fly teeter sticks like an airplane. They had 
a seat they were in, and the computer would tilt the

41:19.532 --> 41:24.738
seat. If it tilted more than 30 degrees, then they 
would get shocked. So when it started tilting,

41:30.885 --> 41:34.509
they had a little stick just like an airplane. If 
the seat was tilting farther, they'd pull back. If

41:37.693 --> 41:41.297
the seat tilted to the left, they'd throw the stick 
to the right. They'd do everything they could to

41:42.745 --> 41:45.568
get that seat back level. So they wouldn't get 
shot? Oh, yeah. Perfectly level. And they could do

41:49.572 --> 41:50.673
it very quickly. And they had a very excellent 
sense of color and pattern descriptions. Some of

41:58.220 --> 42:12.735
the animals were trained to look at a series of 
patterns, four patterns placed in front of them,

41:58.220 --> 42:12.735
mainly squares of different colors. very 
difficult to distinguish if you had a red, red,

42:13.778 --> 42:23.714
white, yellow, or whether you had a red, yellow, 
white, blue, you know, be that close, he'd have to

42:13.778 --> 42:23.714
distinguish. And then he would give a single frame 
down below and let him look at it for about seven

42:23.734 --> 42:29.543
seconds. And then he would have to match, once that 
went off, went outside, he would have to match that

42:30.805 --> 42:40.680
same frame within another seven seconds by 
touching the right picture. So he was

42:46.711 --> 42:50.474
coordinating the colors as well as the patterns. 
And to do it that rapidly, it's very difficult. And

42:57.020 --> 43:00.964
is there any animal research going on right now? 
No, we're not doing those now. Those experiments

43:02.565 --> 43:03.827
have terminated. But funding went out on it. Oh, we 
were doing those up until about six years ago. They

43:10.732 --> 43:12.334
would come up two or three times a year. They have a 
full team of physicians, veterinarians,

43:12.394 --> 43:20.405
technicians, and they bring all their equipment. 
All we can do again, once again, is provide them

43:20.425 --> 43:25.492
with a reactor.

43:30.319 --> 43:36.267
Well, the other thing that we think is exciting 
about our reactor is the pulsing of the reactor. We

43:36.287 --> 43:39.912
were exposing these animals by pulsing.

43:40.921 --> 43:42.422
Our reactor can operate two ways. It can operate at 
a steady power, or we can place it in the pulse mode

43:42.923 --> 43:50.770
and put it on an excursion. It goes on a power 
excursion, but it shuts itself down by a nuclear

43:50.790 --> 44:01.280
technique because it doesn't last very long when 
it goes on the power excursion. The order of

44:02.621 --> 44:04.603
milliseconds, in other words. And we have no 
capability of shutting it off that quickly unless

44:04.623 --> 44:09.527
it shuts itself off. So this is all built into the 
technology of the fuel. And that's why we changed

44:14.084 --> 44:19.388
fuel back in 1969. We changed from the initial fuel 
and went to a more sophisticated research reactor

44:20.489 --> 44:30.799
fuel called Triga. T-R-I-G-A in San Diego. 
They're the manufacturers of it and developers of

44:33.061 --> 44:35.123
it. And we've been a Triga reactor ever since. And 
then that's when you got the capability to pulse?

44:39.957 --> 44:45.702
That's when we went into the capability of pulsing 
and also we upgraded the power by a factor of 10. We

44:45.902 --> 44:52.789
went from a 100 kilowatt reactor to a 1 megawatt 
reactor, steady steady. And when you do that, your

44:53.790 --> 45:05.862
capability of producing these isotopes jumps 
tenfold automatically because there are 10 times

44:53.790 --> 45:05.862
