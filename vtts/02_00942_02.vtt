Unless you can prove that, the programs will have a 
salutary economic impact on the state. It's

00:14.285 --> 00:17.208
needed desperately for some reason. I'm not sure 
that we can prove that right now. Do you think that

00:20.833 --> 00:37.092
with the new dean coming in, that it might be 
possible to have a new degree program at any

00:20.833 --> 00:37.092
college because of the new dean? He will certainly 
have a honeymoon period during which time the

00:37.460 --> 00:48.612
provost office and others will try to meet his 
interest and his demands. I don't know that that

00:48.773 --> 00:54.279
will be a real high priority for him. We've not 
talked about that at all. As far as new programs for

00:58.363 --> 01:06.032
the college are concerned, the program of visual 
studies is probably more important for the campus

00:58.363 --> 01:06.032
as well. I would expect that would occupy more of 
his attention than the program in Irvington at

01:08.054 --> 01:21.372
this

01:08.054 --> 01:21.372
point. The accreditation team was surprised that 
there was no undergraduate lead in degree program

01:21.392 --> 01:32.347
for the MEP. And this would be an appropriate 
vehicle for that. And of course, we've had

01:38.429 --> 01:59.891
continual frustration within the college in 
reaching undergraduate students with our

01:38.429 --> 01:59.891
undergraduate planning courses.

01:59.911 --> 02:00.112
Yeah. Historically, the pre-architecture 
students have not taken planning courses, which

02:00.292 --> 02:06.158
is crazy. Not even the architecture students take 
part in classes. That's true. Which is odd. It

02:15.687 --> 02:28.050
seems to me that a course in planning should be 
required for architecture students, and

02:15.687 --> 02:28.050
certainly for undergraduates toward the end of 
their undergraduate academic career. Yeah, I

02:28.070 --> 02:30.795
think later rather than earlier. They don't have 
vocabulary to understand what we're talking

02:31.366 --> 02:36.253
about until they're juniors or seniors. Some of 
them don't even know where they are when they're

02:36.273 --> 02:43.282
freshmen or sophomores, let alone what they're 
doing here and what they're studying. Or what the

02:44.384 --> 02:53.016
strange discipline might be that they've never 
heard of before.

02:53.036 --> 02:55.399
Don, can you think of anything else you'd like to 
add?

03:01.707 --> 03:04.311
OK, well, I want to thank you for your time. And 
you'll be receiving in due course a transcript,

03:05.232 --> 03:15.388
which you may mark up in whatever way you want and 
then return it to me. And that'll be used to write

03:15.448 --> 03:20.676
the history of accounting education in Texas. 
Thank you. Thank you.
