WEBVTT

00:01.921 --> 00:07.207
Saturdays and Sundays and after school. Then the 
next year I decided that I could learn to type and I

00:07.227 --> 00:23.867
would learn to type and I'd get me a job at the 
courthouse. Well, I only had a hunt and pick system

00:24.829 --> 00:28.553
of typing And when I went to work, they put me to, I 
always had a fairly good legible hand, and they put

00:29.444 --> 00:49.764
me to copying off the evaluation on the evaluation 
sheets of the county in the sheriff's office. And

00:49.784 --> 00:51.946
then I did that for four years. And then I got 
married. And from then on, I did just a little bit of

00:55.469 --> 00:57.812
that. I clerked and I stole them. And then I stood 
for a step and taught school. Then I decided that

01:04.798 --> 01:08.362
was too hard. After I taught, let's see, I taught 
four years. And then I had a little boy. And I stayed

01:18.553 --> 01:24.160
at home with him until he was ready to go to school. 
And then I went, that was in 45, 36, well, I went

01:25.321 --> 01:29.826
back. Just got my certificate. Finished out the 
superintendency and the principal, taught

01:32.243 --> 01:36.970
again. Then I was city tax assessor, the first 
woman to ever hold office in Johnson City. City tax

01:45.603 --> 01:48.828
assessor and collector. That was when we started 
to organize the city. And I took up the taxes, did

01:52.654 --> 01:59.644
the assessing and whatnot for the city. And then I 
decided to go to college in 48. And I went down and

02:07.104 --> 02:09.487
took 12 hours. And I made the A honor roll, which I 
got to take an extra three hours if you carry the B

02:10.408 --> 02:19.457
honor roll system. So I made an A, so I got to carry 
it. Then in the fall, I came back and started

02:22.981 --> 02:28.146
teaching school again. and go to school every 
night at Trinity. I'd catch the 6 o'clock. No, at

02:33.838 --> 02:43.849
that time it ran at 2.30, and my first grade was out 
at 2.30, and the bus stopped right over here where

02:33.838 --> 02:43.849
the U-Totem is. It was not a U-Totem then, but it was 
a big grocery store. And I would meet the bus there

02:49.175 --> 02:58.386
and get on it from school and go to San Antonio to 
Trinity University. And I'd catch the bus out at 12

02:58.838 --> 03:06.528
o'clock at night and come back to Johnson City and 
get to school the next morning at 8. I learned to

03:06.548 --> 03:10.594
read on the bus and I learned to study on the bus. 
That's how I kept going until I got my degree.

03:16.682 --> 03:19.185
That's why I say when I lose faith, I remember you. 
And then on Saturdays, I always had all-day

03:19.205 --> 03:24.673
classes on Saturday. Every Saturday I had all-day 
classes.

03:29.483 --> 03:36.633
Sunday was the only day I had an offer to study for 
preparation.

03:36.653 --> 03:40.398
That was to keep up my schoolwork and everything 
else.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.264
It's a lot of determination. And to sell yourself 
that you can do it. And you're as smart as the next

03:49.830 --> 03:51.733
one. You may not be. But if you can sell yourself 
that you can do it, then you will. Yeah. It was a hard

03:59.386 --> 04:10.702
thing for me to do, to sell myself that I was as smart 
as Kitty Clyde or I was as smart as Margaret or as

03:59.386 --> 04:10.702
Linda. I could do anything they could do. Now, 
that's not a job. But I backed my ears and did it. And

04:21.997 --> 04:24.561
at the same time, I think you enjoyed life, too. I 
did. I enjoyed going to school. I enjoyed

04:27.425 --> 04:29.207
learning. It was a wonderful thing to me. It just 
gave me a different outlook on life altogether.

04:40.543 --> 04:50.554
And I look back today and think, well, how 
fortunate I was just to make myself do the thing

04:40.543 --> 04:50.554
that couldn't be done. And I did it. And I'm proud of 
it. I think so.

05:04.514 --> 05:08.818
But you came from a different background, and your 
roots were... I mean, you learned the history you

05:08.838 --> 05:11.801
live now. You bet. You know that. That's right, 
too.

05:18.648 --> 05:20.790
That's quite a musty one for candy. Well, honey, 
I've got some homemade candy. Oh, no, no, no, no. I

05:24.313 --> 05:26.195
just needed one little piece of candy. If you break 
out the candy, I'm going to break out the weight.

05:29.752 --> 05:33.436
Well, here's all kinds of dookie candy.

05:38.782 --> 05:45.069
Oh,

05:38.782 --> 05:45.069
no.

05:48.533 --> 05:49.154
Look at that. Porcupines. Come on, Steve. One. Oh, 
no. That's got dates in it and everything else. No,

05:57.882 --> 05:58.483
it don't. Double dates and that. What does it have? 
Well, something you wouldn't even think about,

06:01.987 --> 06:04.349
couldn't you? There's no telling.

06:09.715 --> 06:10.837
It looks good. Of course it's good. What's wrong 
with you? I'm going to ask you a question. How long

06:21.509 --> 06:26.134
did you live before you had the electricity to live 
with? I mean, that's just a simple thing that

06:26.890 --> 06:30.413
everybody takes for granted. Well, honey, I was 
born in 1905, and we didn't have any electricity

06:30.433 --> 06:36.759
here until the 40s. That's what I thought. All 
right. Can you add, subtract, or multiply?

06:41.343 --> 06:41.483
Mm-hmm. There you are. That's how long, I know. We 
had a... I wanted to hear you say it. Down at the

06:47.489 --> 06:52.534
ranch, we had a carbide light plant. Mm-hmm. Okay. 
We used that every once in a while, but not very

06:56.455 --> 07:00.559
often. Most of the time it's coal oil because 
carbide was very expensive for us to buy. Now, we

07:07.465 --> 07:11.569
just didn't have it all the time. That's the way it 
was. My daddy went through this country talking to

07:12.670 --> 07:23.560
people and buying up easements where they also 
already put their lines through you. And you know

07:24.147 --> 07:33.778
some of them were so bitter against it that he took 
an act of Congress to get them to sign an easement to

07:24.147 --> 07:33.778
go over their land. That's how far back we were.

07:40.046 --> 07:41.888
Life was just slow. Yes, ma'am. They say the 20th 
century didn't get to Texas until the 40s in many

07:44.111 --> 07:48.636
ways. That's right. 40s and 50s in some places up 
here. You bet. Very true. I mean, but it's not that

07:53.830 --> 07:56.332
the people are backwards. It's that the people 
were in a time frame that is, was a time frame that we

07:56.432 --> 08:07.903
lived with a lot longer than we've lived with the 
time frame we're in now, right? That's right. I

08:08.623 --> 08:10.365
mean, that's electricity. We did not live beyond 
our means. No. And we didn't have it. We couldn't

08:15.630 --> 08:16.971
produce it. But you were not a backwards people. 
No, we were never backwards. And even though we

08:20.974 --> 08:23.837
didn't have radios until late. And we didn't have 
electricity. We didn't have any of the finer

08:31.168 --> 08:35.994
things of life. And our mail, our newspapers were 
weekly. And no, well, the only freight we had was on

08:41.602 --> 08:51.115
a flatbed truck, and that didn't come in here until 
in the 30s. And the 15s and 20s is all done by horse

08:52.741 --> 09:22.697
and mule and wagon and we just lived in a time that 
you grew your food and you lived off of the land and

08:52.741 --> 09:22.697
you didn't you didn't spend money. You didn't have 
it. And there wasn't something to run out of your

09:28.574 --> 09:32.179
five minutes and spend it on? No, sir. No, you 
didn't.

09:38.568 --> 09:45.838
You take your eggs and your milk, or I mean your eggs 
and your cream and your butter to town and you sold

09:38.568 --> 09:45.838
it. You bought that much beans and you had your 
bacon and You had your eggs. You brought your wheat

09:55.753 --> 09:59.818
into town. Right down there at that cross mill was a 
gin and a mill, flour mill and a corn mill. You'd

10:10.849 --> 10:12.271
bring them into town. You had your own flour. You 
had your own mill. You bought your sugar by 100

10:16.916 --> 10:23.042
pounds, and that would last you a whole year. 
That's right. That's it. Because you used sardine

10:25.113 --> 10:29.759
and molasses, and you used honey for your 
sweetening a lot. You didn't use sugar like we do it

10:29.999 --> 10:32.122
today. No. That's an intake. That's right. And you 
lived at home. Let me ask you a question. I remember

10:41.934 --> 10:49.603
even when you speak about your mother, you told me 
that she spent a lot of time, even though she had a

10:41.934 --> 10:49.603
hard life, writing songs. She did. She had some of 
the prettiest songs. I've read some of them. And I

10:53.440 --> 10:57.644
would love to have copies of all those. My daddy and 
my mother sang together beautifully. I'm telling

11:02.728 --> 11:04.009
you. Now, that's happy memories. That's living. 
When the night work was over and everything was

11:07.552 --> 11:17.281
done, we had a great long porch at the ranch in the 
summertime. We'd sit out there. And she would pick

11:19.992 --> 11:23.576
the guitar and they would sing. And she'd put it 
down and maybe just, they'd just sing without it.

11:29.262 --> 11:33.647
And, you know, we listened to them. And we thought 
that they were just, that was just something

11:34.027 --> 11:39.173
wonderful. And it was. It is. And you look back and 
you really enjoy it. And we'd get ready to go to bed.

11:49.540 --> 11:50.701
I think of the Waltons. Well, they'll say 
goodnight to all of them. Well, in place of that,

11:53.684 --> 11:59.710
mother always sat in a rocking chair, and my daddy 
sat in a straight back chair. And we'd go by, and

12:00.751 --> 12:04.575
we'd kiss mother goodnight. And she'd say, now 
sweet dreams, but I'll be in to hear your prayers.

12:13.624 --> 12:19.530
Didn't make any difference how cold, how wet, or 
whatnot, or how tired. That was ritual with

12:19.814 --> 12:23.299
mother. We said our prayers. And he wasn't now 
laying me down to sleep.

12:30.149 --> 12:31.451
It was really a little prayer. But it always wound 
up. Make me a good girl. Make me a better girl.

12:44.891 --> 12:47.434
Make me mind my mother. That was two things. Not 
that she told us, but she'd tell us. You pray for the

12:54.446 --> 12:58.571
things that you know you need. And that was one of 
them. Make me a better girl. Help me to mind my

13:03.115 --> 13:04.337
mother. Mother told us that she told us not to do 
something. She said, every time you don't do it,

13:10.103 --> 13:14.007
when I tell you, you'll have trouble. And honest to 
goodness, that was just as sure as shooting that

13:14.408 --> 13:19.613
happened. Made her believe her. But that was one of 
the things that, to me, was the happiest times of my

13:21.222 --> 13:29.812
life. We didn't have a whole lot. We had a lot of 
love. And you can take a lot of hardship as long as

13:34.957 --> 13:40.844
you've got love. But your mother came from a loving 
family, didn't she? Was your mom's family a hard

13:46.871 --> 13:50.875
life family? Well, grandfather and grandmother 
always had more than a good living. But they were

14:00.670 --> 14:02.372
good managers. My daddy, bless his heart, he was 
the sweetest thing that ever lived. And he never

14:08.462 --> 14:13.349
met a person that he couldn't see some good in. I 
don't care who he was. I never heard my father say

14:14.891 --> 14:19.618
there wasn't some good in the worst people. He 
loved everybody. And he was his own worst enemy.

14:24.059 --> 14:26.162
Uncle Tom, I want to borrow some money today. Well, 
how much do you need? Run down his pocket. Maybe the

14:31.530 --> 14:33.493
last time he'd see Uncle Tom. That'd be it. He was, 
that's the way it went.

14:41.405 --> 14:47.654
And I can remember, I'll never forget if I lived to 
be a thousand years old. After my father had been

14:47.674 --> 14:50.258
dead about two weeks, mother and i were in town 
mother didn't like to drive and i went down the

14:51.031 --> 15:20.093
range and brought her in she wanted to attend some 
business i met one of the corley boys he says aunt

14:51.031 --> 15:20.093
kitty i want to see you just a minute he walked over 
of course aunt kitty and uncle tom that was the way

14:51.031 --> 15:20.093
affectionately everyone spoke of them and Mama 
said, well, what is it that you need or you want? He

15:26.338 --> 15:35.211
said, Uncle Tom loaned me $5 before he died, that 
two weeks, and said, I want to pay you back.

15:38.695 --> 15:46.907
If she could have collected a third of what she had, 
that was just one of the good ones that came across.

15:47.427 --> 15:51.612
And was less able to pay than any that I know of that 
was on the books. But yet he paid his. But so many of

15:54.797 --> 16:00.304
the others felt like that mother never knew it. 
Yes, forgot it. But this was her house, right? She

16:05.470 --> 16:15.764
built this house after 35.

16:15.784 --> 16:15.924
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's licking good candy. It 
sure is.

16:23.668 --> 16:25.932
Really good. I bet you're getting tired. Well, 
probably so. I am too.

16:34.085 --> 16:37.189
So what time are you going to go down tomorrow? I 
don't know. They keep doing what I get up for. What I

16:40.915 --> 16:42.197
have to get up for. True. You're a lady of leisure 
now. Hmm. I'm not a lady of leisure or pleasure, but

16:47.603 --> 16:52.588
I'm not going to get up early. If I get up 8 o'clock, 
that's fine. That sounds good. I don't see any use

16:58.554 --> 17:03.800
in getting up early. You've gotten up early long 
enough. You've spent half your life getting up

17:06.543 --> 17:09.606
early. This morning I got up at 3 o'clock and set my 
yeast. That's right. I baked three loaves of bread

17:17.347 --> 17:20.772
this morning. And forgot it. You know what I mean? 
And I let it rise too, and it's going to be wasp

17:23.876 --> 17:27.121
nasty. But that's all right. It's going to eat. I'm 
not going to do away with

17:29.645 --> 17:36.254
it. It's going to be coarse-poured. The other I 
have in there is real fine. It's nice. I didn't let

17:41.441 --> 17:43.985
it rise too. I forgot it. Yeah, and he called me at

17:47.375 --> 18:17.331
Fredericksburg

17:47.375 --> 18:17.331
and he said,

18:17.817 --> 18:22.143
I know you have a good job, and I know you're 
satisfied. But there's one thing I want you to do

18:22.163 --> 18:24.766
for me. And I know you can do it." And I said, well, 
Linda, what in the world could that be? He said, I

18:31.575 --> 18:35.521
want you to go into San Antonio. And then it was a 
job, on-the-job training program that he put out.

18:42.775 --> 18:51.783
And you see, and you get jobs for these little boys 
and girls in San Antonio that are capable and

18:42.775 --> 18:51.783
willing to work and place them. And I want you to do 
that. And I said, well, what district, what part of

18:54.165 --> 18:57.188
San Antonio? Well, that was over in the Edgewood 
District, and that was one of the poorest

18:57.208 --> 19:01.331
districts. And boy, I never worked as hard in all my 
life as I did right there. But it paid dividends. I

19:11.561 --> 19:12.141
grant you. But for the same token, it was one of the 
hardest things I ever tried to do in my life. And

19:22.712 --> 19:26.895
that's why I was in second grade teacher. And then I 
worked there a couple of years. And I said, now

19:29.738 --> 19:31.259
that's sufficient. I'm going. So I went to the 
north side. And there's where I finished up. And I

19:37.505 --> 19:41.368
helped open up the Lackawanna City Elementary 
School. And then when they opened up Collins

19:42.125 --> 19:48.472
North, my principal said, he went over to open it 
up. He said, well, I have to have some old teachers

19:48.492 --> 19:55.760
that know what they're doing to put this thing on 
the right track. He said, if I open this up, can I

19:56.181 --> 19:59.965
pick my teachers? And the superintendent of the 
district said, yes. Well, I was picked to go over

20:03.008 --> 20:05.451
there. And then that was another thing. We had a 
program. that

20:12.280 --> 20:35.014
we taught really it was things that should have 
been taught in the home but we had it at school and it

20:12.280 --> 20:35.014
was more or less on self-rule and Now do you think, 
if you do this, do you think that all the others are

20:35.433 --> 20:43.323
going to accept that and that's the way to treat 
people? And those little sixth graders, man, they

20:43.343 --> 20:57.601
would ante up right quick and they fell in line with 
all this self-discipline and you'd walk in that

20:43.343 --> 20:57.601
realm of mind if I were not there and you could hear a 
pin drop. Because one would call down the other and

20:58.863 --> 21:02.908
say, no, that's not right, don't do that. Miss Abel 
won't like that. That's not the way we're supposed

21:05.914 --> 21:08.678
to do it. Do you think they'd cut in line for one 
another? That's not right. You're infringing on

21:13.825 --> 21:15.487
the other folks. He was there first. Don't get in 
front of him. Get behind him. Take your turn. And

21:21.936 --> 21:23.137
things like that. And they would get in, and I'd 
give them the opportunity to discuss all major

21:23.237 --> 21:32.710
problems that came out in the paper of a morning. 
What do you think about this? Are they handling

21:34.665 --> 21:36.167
this right? They were taught to rely on their own 
judgment.

21:42.036 --> 21:44.060
And how to do that. Then I was put over to the 
district. He really just picked me up and said, now

21:50.970 --> 21:53.875
you go do this. That's how I went. He respected your 
opinions. He didn't know he was listening to them.

22:00.280 --> 22:04.484
Well, he didn't to a great extent, yet he did in the 
long run, too. He loved me, and I know it, and I loved

22:04.664 --> 22:08.928
him. We'd fuss and we'd fight. But by the same 
token, blood runs deeper than water. They might be

22:15.674 --> 22:20.959
meeting today, but any time they do, they're... 
When they began to down him and say, he did this, I

22:20.979 --> 22:29.747
can name so many good things that he did, that we 
have quite a battle. and I believe as strong as I

22:30.503 --> 22:59.802
believe that the sun will come up in the east 
tomorrow that history will deal with him as a good

22:30.503 --> 22:59.802
president and not as a falsifying president I may 
not ever see the day or know it but I believe that

22:30.503 --> 22:59.802
truly there isn't a president living or dead That 
you can't go back and find the skeleton in that

23:00.372 --> 23:09.964
closet if you look there from far enough and deep 
enough. And he's no exception to the rule. But

23:13.048 --> 23:20.618
right now they make it as though it's a mountain and 
that's a bunch of balloon. It's newsworthy and

23:20.638 --> 23:22.701
sellable, right? Well, I don't know whether it's 
even... People much rather read something about a

23:23.980 --> 23:31.712
president that talks about his mistakes than 
about his successes. That is success. That is very

23:32.974 --> 23:34.156
true. And it's always better than good for 
reading. You bet. But as I said before, we had such a

23:36.340 --> 23:41.127
hard time getting an education. We didn't have 
free school. That was out. It was a five-month

23:45.594 --> 23:49.580
school, and if you could do it in five months, you 
were good. And if you couldn't, well, that was bad.

23:51.318 --> 23:52.620
But they'd make an effort. Our parents make all the 
effort in the world to send us to school at seven

23:52.640 --> 23:57.687
months. But both of them on each side of the house 
being teachers, it wasn't no problem to keep us at

23:57.707 --> 24:04.776
home and make us do our work. So we were not too 
handicapped in lots of respects. But it just burns

24:11.085 --> 24:19.857
me up to think that a kid will lay out of school when 
the bus comes to his door and pick him up and we'd

24:11.085 --> 24:19.857
have to ride horseback and take our cold lunch and 
time we'd lope a horse and it'd joke up and down and

24:20.191 --> 24:27.184
be all crumbs when we'd get here and we'd eat it or do 
it that. And then these kids lazy things can't even

24:27.564 --> 24:31.191
get there on time. Shh. I just don't. I don't have 
any patience with people like that. Well, I guess

24:40.748 --> 24:41.870
it sounds better. You better cut your deal off. 
Why? Okay, I just cut it off a minute ago. You want to

24:47.124 --> 24:48.467
talk to me for a while? Well, I will if you've got a 
bet. Sure. If that's what you want. Well, I think we

24:51.292 --> 24:52.354
ought to. I just...

24:52.394 --> 24:58.787
Might as well continue talking. Well, it's 
whatever you want. Well, it seems it's going to be a

25:02.401 --> 25:04.704
book, so might as well. It's a lot to talk about. I 
also realize that your grandkids are going to have

25:06.386 --> 25:11.933
these tapes, too, one of these days. There's some 
good stuff on them. I'll have them transcribed. I

25:14.797 --> 25:15.758
told that to Pat. That transcribed and edited the 
things that are repeats and stuff we've talked

25:16.479 --> 25:24.690
about, but give them a good piece of information, 
too. They won't get it because they're not doing

25:25.230 --> 25:27.373
it. No, they're not doing it. But your 
great-grandkids are going to want it. Well, I

25:33.636 --> 25:34.478
don't know. I have Davies' children may care to 
listen to it. Oh, sure, because Pat's geared up for

25:39.610 --> 25:42.777
it. But I doubt that the others will because 
they... Well, you never can tell. There's always

25:50.337 --> 25:55.083
that exceptional little gene that pops up there 
and makes one of them different. You can't count on

25:55.843 --> 25:57.125
the future. Oh, that's right, too. And good seeds 
somewhere along the way that'll turn out just like

25:59.929 --> 26:03.273
you. You know, I was talking to Corky coming in from 
the ranch the other day. I said, Corky, how many

26:09.741 --> 26:16.429
times have I pointed out to you and told you things 
along this highway that... No historian has ever

26:16.662 --> 26:20.508
put down at all. I know. And it's time that somebody 
do it. That's right. Now, that old Oddfellow

26:25.295 --> 26:29.101
building over at Round Mountain. Yeah, I remember 
that. The Oddfellow's Lodge had a 99-year lease on

26:30.263 --> 26:34.730
that. Did it? And it will be up in, well, 19... I 
believe it's 1990. I believe that's when the lease

26:46.210 --> 26:49.675
is up.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.220
But of course they've sold it. We have no odd 
fellows here. But that still doesn't give a clear

26:55.844 --> 27:03.434
title and a clear lead to it until this is all set 
aside. Now they've improved it and worked it, but

27:03.835 --> 27:09.042
that was a liver stable underneath it. All right, 
there's very few people really know what a liver

27:09.162 --> 27:13.348
stable was. Of this generation that's growing up. 
And the stalls were there, and it really was a pony

27:18.555 --> 27:24.227
express. I can remember when they would bring 
things from the mail carrier to this, from Marble

27:24.548 --> 27:33.767
Falls to Johnson City that was carried in a hack. 
Right. Just a plain old hat. And that was when Roy

27:36.881 --> 27:41.230
Stubbs would come by and say, come on, kids. Tom 
loaned one of these kids to me to help ferry this

27:41.611 --> 27:49.026
mail across down here at this crossing. Why? 
Children don't know what ferrying a male across

27:49.778 --> 27:53.581
the crossing is. Well, they don't teach it to you in 
history classes now. I mean, the naivety that goes

27:55.623 --> 28:01.228
out from the professor's mouth to the student is a 
crime. They don't talk about those things. No,

28:02.890 --> 28:03.450
they don't. I've got to tell you something real 
quick. I thought about you doing something for me

28:06.433 --> 28:19.785
also, which would be very beneficial, is if we 
could sit down and have you tell a straight segment

28:06.433 --> 28:19.785
of history, such as ferry crossing, such as 
cattle, as your gift to students in the future.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.311
Have you thought about doing that? No, I haven't. I 
thought that I cannot do it. You would be the one to

28:27.796 --> 28:42.275
say, just as if you were standing in front of a 
mirror yourself and setting this tape down and

28:27.796 --> 28:42.275
recording what you would be teaching a group of 
children about history in Blanco County. I think

28:42.915 --> 28:48.743
that this could be a beneficial segment of 
historic tapes to be used in classrooms. And I

28:49.297 --> 28:57.473
would like to ask you to do it, because if I decide 
not to go into something like social work or

28:49.297 --> 28:57.473
something, I'm going to go right on back into the 
classroom. And I know that it would be a marvelous

28:57.493 --> 29:05.088
segment to go along with teaching students, 
because if I teach, it's going to be social

28:57.493 --> 29:05.088
studies. Now, Annie, do you know that because we 
didn't have any railroad connection. And the only

29:12.699 --> 29:22.669
reason it was one at Marble Falls, and it was laid 
down for the purpose of carrying the granite to

29:12.699 --> 29:22.669
build the capital at Austin. Now that was reason 
for that. Because they quarried it in Marble

29:24.731 --> 29:27.354
Falls, and they sent it to Austin. That's right. 
And they sent it in to Austin. That was after they

29:29.416 --> 29:35.942
ran out of the limestone, and that's what was first 
to be built out of was limestone. worked at three

29:35.922 --> 29:41.808
different quarries to get this, and they didn't 
have enough. So they, Dara's, offered the granite

29:41.828 --> 29:47.855
if they would send the labor. So the Texas prison 
guards were sent out there to cut the... Oh, yeah.

29:53.781 --> 29:58.407
I've heard stories about the prisoners tunneling 
through that granite trying to escape. They dug

29:58.527 --> 30:00.369
tunnels back in there. Sure they have. And they 
were... That was one of them. Well, Steve's

30:05.771 --> 30:28.647
brother-in-law teaches in the New York public 
schools, and I have thought what a surprise to be

30:05.771 --> 30:28.647
able to send to him a segment of, hello, this is 
Alan, this is a segment of Texas history which we'd

30:05.771 --> 30:28.647
like to share with you and your students here in New 
York City at John Bowne Elementary School. Sure.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.302
But I think it would be very beneficial. It would be 
very beneficial. Now, you take this lithographic

30:32.803 --> 30:38.290
quarry that's over at Marble Falls. That's the 
only one in the state of Texas. Right. And they use

30:43.415 --> 30:49.923
that all together in every airplane movement that 
they have from there. And it's quarried right

30:50.383 --> 30:53.266
here. Yeah. Right. You want to get your phone?
