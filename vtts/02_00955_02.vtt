WEBVTT

00:09.785 --> 00:12.088
I didn't really hear you say testing. No, but I 
think it's five minutes. So I didn't realize that

00:16.432 --> 00:20.717
you were the one that got the seed lab out there. 
I'll tell you what

00:21.458 --> 00:30.568
happened.

00:34.433 --> 00:39.218
Gatesville was being filled with delinquents. So 
they were going to build a new school. Well, the

00:44.583 --> 00:49.228
speaker and I at this time was Gus Mutch. And they 
were also going to build a school for mentally

00:50.970 --> 00:57.197
retarded. And I said, Gus, I tell you what, you got 
people in here that you can't control. And I can, I

01:06.198 --> 01:11.283
got, you got people here that you control, and I 
can. Let's do this. Let's get the mentally

01:14.286 --> 01:28.040
retarded school the money for that, designated 
for Brenner, and I'll take the school, the

01:14.286 --> 01:28.040
delinquent school.

01:32.204 --> 01:32.745
So Mr. Healy, who at that time was made, was 
appropriation.

01:41.862 --> 01:45.888
So

01:41.862 --> 01:45.888
it was all set up. Yeah.

01:50.133 --> 02:01.388
Burnham, buy the land, furnish the land, get him to 
furnish the land for the school right here.

02:01.408 --> 02:01.568
Uh,

02:05.041 --> 02:06.843
We hit it. Well, I came down here and talked to, uh, 
Monroe Honish at that particular time. Do you

02:12.610 --> 02:13.131
remember? I don't. Monroe and, uh, and Judge, uh, 
Semain, and a few other people like that. Got them

02:22.241 --> 02:27.768
together there at the , and told them what I believe 
I can do. Of course, they were all happy, because

02:28.829 --> 02:33.715
that was going to put a lot of people to work around 
here.

02:37.576 --> 02:44.352
And there was two, I'm not going to tell you who they 
were, but there was two people that asked more

02:37.576 --> 02:44.352
questions. All the rest of them put together. And 
they didn't give one dime to help buy the land.

02:54.198 --> 03:02.808
Where, as the banks, I think First National 
furnished about $7,000, $8,000, and Citizen

02:54.198 --> 03:02.808
wasn't quite that much. And then a lot of 
individuals, like Self and Milton Archer and

03:03.869 --> 03:17.966
Murcher and I don't know who, would furnish X 
number of dollars. In fact, I feel that's the best

03:17.986 --> 03:21.690
of what they furnish.

03:23.999 --> 03:27.663
And we first got enough money together to buy that 
land. Well, this neck,

03:27.683 --> 03:53.770
if you can recall, this neck came up to the highway, 
and these colored people on the—well,

03:27.683 --> 03:53.770
one

03:27.683 --> 03:53.770
of them got the Sternberger is on the land, and they 
wanted, I think, at that time, $500 a acre. I'll be

03:59.601 --> 04:01.383
there for you. At that time, not now. Anyway, we got 
the money to buy the whole thing.

04:10.156 --> 04:19.690
And I told the manager, or head man of the 
delinquent,

04:22.741 --> 04:36.640
We'd get that land there for him if he would give me

04:22.741 --> 04:36.640
this

04:22.741 --> 04:36.640
neck in there and build us a building. I'd help him 
get some extra money in his appropriation.

04:45.132 --> 04:49.879
Mr. Healy had already told me to go ahead and put 
that proposition to him. And he'd get the money and

04:50.821 --> 04:52.663
put it in there. So he did.

04:55.966 --> 05:00.491
And so, actually, the, uh, that's what we did. And 
they did the, uh, the, uh...

05:00.991 --> 05:16.246
Let me call it again. It was not, uh...

05:21.145 --> 05:28.974
Anyway, before the school was built,

05:21.145 --> 05:28.974
there was a fellow by the name of Turman, too. He's 
dead now. And they deeded us that neck up there and

05:31.316 --> 05:40.026
built us that building. And that's the only 
property that the Texas Department of

05:41.488 --> 05:49.717
Agriculture owns.

05:50.118 --> 05:50.578
I didn't know that. I

05:51.858 --> 06:10.064
guess, what did you do in between the time that you 
became, well, you ended your years as deputy

05:51.858 --> 06:10.064
commissioner and then took the job in the Farmers 
Home Administration? Were you involved still in

06:10.785 --> 06:12.848
agricultural? I was just on my

06:13.829 --> 06:19.537
own. You said that you were... You were appointed 
in August of 1977. I was the first one in the United

06:24.449 --> 06:29.173
States to be appointed. By Carter? By Carter. Or 
was that, that was

06:32.155 --> 06:37.600
just by Carter.

06:40.322 --> 06:49.510
What kind of influence did he have over you when you 
could do pretty much what you wanted? I did mostly

06:49.530 --> 06:51.251
anything I wanted. Loaning money. You have 
different sections in Temple there. You had the

06:59.057 --> 07:09.190
loan section for cattle, loan section for houses, 
loan section for community property, community

06:59.057 --> 07:09.190
improvement.

07:10.712 --> 07:21.366
Then you had your loan section that would help 
people to go in business that couldn't afford it,

07:10.712 --> 07:21.366
yet they were worthy of it. And that's what I 
control. How long were you in this position? How

07:31.137 --> 07:31.858
many years?

07:37.565 --> 07:39.368
About three and a half, I guess. Three and a half? 
Uh-huh. I couldn't move early. I could have stayed

07:42.431 --> 07:48.619
on, but this, I don't want this out.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.811
It got to me.

07:57.195 --> 07:58.757
That's when things started tightening up. And I 
got there at the end.

08:10.609 --> 08:16.395
People would come in the office that our field 
people had turned down. And I was, you might say,

08:17.860 --> 08:22.647
the last resort. And I could see where they 
couldn't pay for it, no way. Yet they had taken

08:29.216 --> 08:32.360
their land and taken a lot of it. And it got next to 
me. I just couldn't...

08:35.564 --> 08:45.538
What I did, I just... I called

08:47.088 --> 09:01.667
the in-house attorney at Scott & White, who I had 
served in the legislature with, and I told him, I

08:47.088 --> 09:01.667
said, now, I know you've got the best doctor up 
there. I said, that's the one I want. I said, I swear

09:04.210 --> 09:12.100
to you, Jamie, his name's Jamie Clinton, I believe 
I've got...

09:15.573 --> 09:27.266
He said,

09:15.573 --> 09:27.266
Bill, I'll bet you don't, because I think I know 
what you're doing. I'm not the doctor. And he's an

09:29.188 --> 09:30.489
attorney. And so he went away. He says, just sit 
right there. I'll call you back in about 30

09:36.375 --> 09:38.878
minutes. I don't know if he did. He called me back. 
He had me an appointment set up with his doctor. And

09:45.577 --> 09:56.212
he set me up with a doctor,

09:45.577 --> 09:56.212
a real nice fellow, one of the old ones up there. He 
made speeches in Mayo and the University of

09:56.252 --> 10:07.207
Mexico. He was well known in the medical field. 
When you go through there, Scott and Mike, they

10:14.146 --> 10:20.615
send you around to a specialist in every field. And 
they went from the top of my head to my feet. Because

10:26.544 --> 10:31.391
I didn't know what to put on, what to fill out. 
Anyway, end of the second day, I went in to see my

10:31.411 --> 10:40.804
doctor. And he... I said, Bill,

10:42.513 --> 10:52.005
you carry your work home with you, don't you? I 
said, Doctor, I do. I worry. I worry about these

10:54.649 --> 10:55.870
poor people. I said, at one time I had lots and lots 
of money, but now they've lived it up, and what are

10:57.773 --> 11:06.684
they going to do? They moved out of their places. 
You know, anyway, I said, Bill, I...

11:14.238 --> 11:20.088
He said, you shouldn't worry about what you owe 
them. You can't do that. He said,

11:23.273 --> 11:35.152
the best thing you can do is go home and take two 
aspirin and go to bed. And wound up. that I have

11:40.715 --> 11:44.758
nervous stomach. Said, Bill, you don't even have 
an ulcer. You're nervous. Your nervous stomach is

11:51.104 --> 11:54.527
causing you this trouble. I still got it. I just got 
it back from Staten White last night. Well, during

12:00.952 --> 12:05.136
those years, that was when we had inflation. Were 
people really losing their farms because of the

12:05.656 --> 12:10.080
economy? Because they spent too much money. They 
kind of lived too high. That was the cause of most of

12:14.249 --> 12:16.112
it. Then a

12:16.132 --> 12:31.315
lot

12:16.132 --> 12:31.315
of the products weren't selling like they should.

12:31.335 --> 12:38.987
In 1979, the Overview said that there were like 
over 14,000 farm programs under the, in Texas,

12:39.980 --> 12:52.056
under the Farmers Home Administration, that was 
like twice as many as in any other state. Was this

12:52.517 --> 13:00.227
mainly the reason because agriculture was the 
biggest thing for Texas at that time? A lot of, you

13:02.009 --> 13:08.097
know, we used to have lots of, look here, we used to 
have, of course you don't remember, but We used to

13:08.414 --> 13:10.036
have lots of cotton here. At one time, we had about 
seven or eight gins here in this county. We don't

13:13.901 --> 13:15.343
even have a gin now. I've noticed it was just 
peanuts. That's all. And they can't make any money

13:21.691 --> 13:23.893
out of cattle. I know, because I raised cattle. You 
can't build off of cattle. Another thing, too, the

13:28.699 --> 13:35.788
boys, and girls were going off to college, just 
like you, and getting better educated. And they

13:47.478 --> 13:53.685
were not going back to the farm to handle that 
tractor. And they were married. They wanted to

13:58.270 --> 14:04.898
take their family out to Austin to eat once in a 
while. like people here do. But you couldn't do it.

14:09.919 --> 14:14.264
You couldn't make that kind of money and pay your 
taxes and pay for your land. You cannot, in no way,

14:14.764 --> 14:34.665
buy your land, buy your farm equipment

14:14.764 --> 14:34.665
and your house and pay for what you raise on the farm 
at this time. Do you think agriculture, then, is

14:35.388 --> 14:41.235
going down? What do you predict? Down, down, down. 
I was talking to a man yesterday. It's Scott and

14:44.639 --> 14:47.423
White. He

14:47.703 --> 14:51.988
was from Oklahoma. He said, well, all of a sudden, 
we're in such bad shape. And I was talking to a

14:55.993 --> 14:57.896
nurse. I had some dental work while I was up there.

15:07.400 --> 15:15.790
Not a good dentist here, but since I had the time, I 
had to sit there and wait for another appointment

15:07.400 --> 15:15.790
between the doctors while I went in there. And she, 
the nurse, I knew her. And I said, well, how you

15:21.337 --> 15:24.240
doing? And I told her, we talked. She said, her home 
is in Iowa. She said, she's been up home. She said,

15:31.649 --> 15:34.032
Mr. Pratt, you just don't realize it. what 
condition those poor farmers are in and the small

15:35.058 --> 16:03.715
business has we there's towns up there with say two 
and three thousand populations the whole town is

15:35.058 --> 16:03.715
boarded up and out

15:35.058 --> 16:03.715
do you see um do you see any kind of any field or any 
area of agriculture that come back do you see any

15:35.058 --> 16:03.715
area in agriculture that might prosper in the next 
year? No. A lot of people at A&M are not really in the

16:06.717 --> 16:11.542
agriculture part. They're in ag business. That's 
it. The ag business people are the only ones making

16:14.105 --> 16:18.170
money. John, David's brother-in-law, he sells 
out of Kansas City, he sells

16:18.190 --> 16:28.643
farm equipment. But the A lot of your—well,

16:32.888 --> 16:40.218
the north you go, the worse it gets. A lot of those 
people up there are selling out. Consequently,

16:43.682 --> 16:52.374
the ones down this way—well, Boggy, he bought 
tractors and things, brought them down here, used

16:43.682 --> 16:52.374
them. He didn't buy anything around here new, 
because those people up there couldn't sell it. Do

17:01.373 --> 17:06.778
you think the Farmer's Home Administration is 
working? Do you think it'll probably phase out

17:07.739 --> 17:10.963
because of the economy? No, it can't phase out. I 
say it can't. Of course, anything can phase out,

17:16.628 --> 17:24.977
but no, I don't think it'll phase out because they 
have mortgaged on too much. The last year that I was

17:25.357 --> 17:30.182
there, I lent out over $700 million. How much do you 
think the state will get back from that? That's not

17:39.679 --> 17:40.480
the state. That's the federal. Federal. Well, 
they won't get back much in interest, because the

17:44.906 --> 17:51.896
interest probably wasn't over 3% or 4% or 5%, 
something like that. And they'll get back more

17:51.916 --> 18:00.608
from the housing authority that we lent money to 
build houses. And they'll get back more from the

18:01.043 --> 18:07.472
country water supply. They'll pay it back. But the 
farms will be less and less. More of them have to be

18:15.182 --> 18:17.646
sold. Another reason of it is when they put the 
embargo, Carter started that. He was wrong there.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.448
He was wrong. Russia.

18:36.652 --> 18:40.017
Because of that Afghanistan mess, you know. All 
right. They put the embargo on them. We were

18:43.862 --> 18:47.406
selling them lots and lots of wheat and corn. Then 
they turned around and started buying it from

18:47.426 --> 18:58.962
Argentina

18:47.426 --> 18:58.962
and other countries and now are buying it cheaper 
And consequently, they're not buying from us, not

19:00.646 --> 19:05.952
much from us. That's one reason our farmers are in 
such bad shape. So the farmers, they didn't mind

19:09.015 --> 19:12.519
selling it to Russia? Oh, no. Not as long as we had 
that dollar. Mm-hmm. What area of the Farmers'

19:18.285 --> 19:23.630
Home Administration really worked in? It was not 
apparently the farming. Was it housing or...

19:29.148 --> 19:32.051
community, which worked the best, did you think? 
Community. Community. Um, what... And we, we, uh,

19:34.613 --> 19:57.674
are, we lent money to a lot of people that, uh,

19:34.613 --> 19:57.674
of course, they were all investigating and 
wrestling with people that, uh, and they would

19:34.613 --> 19:57.674
have to have something to start with and be 
knowledgeable of the product they were going to

19:34.613 --> 19:57.674
make. And, uh, We lent them money, and we got most of 
our money back. Actually, we didn't loan them any

20:05.334 --> 20:07.156
money. We would guarantee them money, like 
savings loan up here. Loan Tina Melcher $50,000 to

20:18.168 --> 20:25.756
build a new home. And she's got a good job. she'll 
pay it, and we'll guarantee that she will pay it.

20:33.348 --> 20:36.613
And that's the same thing with most all the other 
things. So that's mainly what the state did, just

20:36.633 --> 20:39.537
guarantee it? I'm not a state now. Well, I mean, the 
state did for the federal government. They

20:44.504 --> 20:45.886
guaranteed... The state didn't. The state didn't 
have anything to do with the pharmaceutical

20:47.469 --> 20:50.433
stuff. But your job was just to guarantee the 
federal... government. My job was my job was was to

20:57.757 --> 21:12.314
use my judgment for this particular people could 
pay this back.

21:14.116 --> 21:23.867
So what did I know it was a real bad economy time and 
everything but did Carter It seemed like he just

21:25.298 --> 21:28.983
got into a hole and he didn't know how to get himself 
out. But with that, at the end when inflation was

21:29.423 --> 21:41.660
really getting bad, were there pressures put on 
you not to give out loans or anything from the

21:29.423 --> 21:41.660
federal government? There was more put on me to 
give loans than there was. They wanted you to give

21:47.067 --> 21:48.589
loans? Some of the senators up there would call me 
and ask me to loan over the old. I said, no, I'm not

21:57.567 --> 22:00.972
going to sign it. I don't think you can pay it back. 
Oh, I didn't. I said, well, now, I'll tell you what.

22:06.078 --> 22:10.645
I'll send you the papers up there, and you get them 
signed up there in Washington. They said, oh, no,

22:10.665 --> 22:12.567
you know we can't do that. I said, well, I'm not 
going to sign it. Period. So you just took care of

22:16.261 --> 22:19.746
Texas, just the state of Texas? State of Texas. So 
since you're an agriculture man, I'll end it by

22:22.850 --> 22:39.314
asking you, those

22:22.850 --> 22:39.314
years that you were in the Agriculture Department 
and you had influence in the state were probably

22:22.850 --> 22:39.314
the most prosperous years of Texas. And what do you 
feel like will be the future of the Ag Department of

22:46.079 --> 22:51.885
Texas and the Farmers Home Administration? Of 
course, it depends on the management. I ran

22:57.310 --> 23:09.561
into a man that was being examined, an SCS man, out 
of A&M. He's a hot shot. He's one of the big boys over

23:10.843 --> 23:12.424
there.

23:16.066 --> 23:19.190
And we shook hands and talked. He says, oh, we just 
had John White back there instead of the man that we

23:19.210 --> 23:24.136
got. He says, that man that we got? I said, sorry. 
Sorry. Now, of course, I'm not telling you this to

23:29.102 --> 23:40.977
be corny or anything

23:29.102 --> 23:40.977
like

23:29.102 --> 23:40.977
that.

23:46.323 --> 24:10.558
Some

23:46.323 --> 24:10.558
of the employees tell me that the

23:46.323 --> 24:10.558
Farmers' Home Administration

23:46.323 --> 24:10.558
is not loaning as much money

24:13.525 --> 24:17.613
to people that really, they think they can pay 
back.

24:20.658 --> 24:25.247
Because of, let's just face it, Republicans are a 
lot more conservative. And older you get, I'm a lot

24:25.567 --> 24:32.580
more conservative now than I was when I was... your 
age or even older. It's just a matter of life. The

24:40.255 --> 24:43.561
older you get, the more conservative you get. And 
there it comes. So do you see yourself as a liberal

24:45.204 --> 24:48.529
in your younger days? Or a conservative liberal? I 
never was a real liberal.

24:57.966 --> 24:58.787
I was, I'd say, middle. because I was raised 
money-wise conservative.

25:15.931 --> 25:27.947
But the agricultural

25:15.931 --> 25:27.947
industry, I think,

25:15.931 --> 25:27.947
the future looks like And a lot of people claim, oh, 
we ought to get rid of, a lot of you liberals, say we

25:29.311 --> 25:44.384
ought to get rid of the

25:29.311 --> 25:44.384
corporations. Oh, no, let these corporations 
farm. Well, that's not, I know Tineco, I talked to

25:48.688 --> 25:59.217
the director of Tineco, and they control 90% of the 
almonds grown in California.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.622
And they sold them. They wanted the X number of 
dollars for them. But two of the main chain stores

26:11.606 --> 26:26.521
went in there and said, we'll give you this for 
them, which was a lot less than this X money.

26:26.841 --> 26:27.702
Your chain stores control more of it than any of the 
other corporations that do the farming.

26:36.884 --> 26:39.751
Well, thank you for your interview. I appreciate 
it. Well, that wasn't much.

26:59.879 --> 27:24.731
Good.

27:24.751 --> 27:24.852
Good. Good. Good. Good.

27:28.617 --> 27:49.182
Yeah,

27:28.617 --> 27:49.182
like that doesn't get called into our file. What 
happens if we just type it in and they type it in?

27:50.324 --> 27:51.165
Okay, now we have something to pick up on. This 
doesn't have an access to the database. Yeah. It

27:52.206 --> 27:53.307
doesn't know whether the switch is actually 
powered. But what I'm saying about afterwards, it

27:53.327 --> 27:54.529
doesn't go through. It's just going to end up with 
this now thing that we've got. Yeah, I think if

27:55.790 --> 27:57.372
we've got the HMI view on it, it's going to have the 
HMI view. It's going to have the HMI view. So how

27:58.283 --> 28:20.562
are

27:58.283 --> 28:20.562
we

27:58.283 --> 28:20.562
going to know if it's loaded? .

28:49.014 --> 28:49.034
. . .

29:02.476 --> 29:24.636
And

29:02.476 --> 29:24.636
what was the other question you had?

29:31.231 --> 29:52.658
So

29:31.231 --> 29:52.658
I wonder, a person who's been in and out of the 
college, and they're, say, ten feet out right now,

29:31.231 --> 29:52.658
how early is that? Is that when you're the one who's 
going to call back and say, is this what we're

29:52.678 --> 29:54.420
doing?

30:08.896 --> 30:30.959
.

30:30.979 --> 30:32.501
. . . . . Thank

30:34.276 --> 30:41.873
you. I'm

30:43.287 --> 31:06.224
just, I don't do anything wrong. I'm just, I don't 
do anything wrong. I don't do anything wrong. .

31:33.028 --> 31:33.048
. .

31:39.835 --> 32:02.118
It

31:39.835 --> 32:02.118
would be helpful to have this. Because if the car 
doesn't break, then we've got to move our grocery

32:02.138 --> 32:03.880
bar to the doctor. But then there's the car. And 
then there's our car. And then find the old car.

32:05.481 --> 32:05.862
They can't find it. So they can't find it. So I think 
having a bridge is really helpful.

32:12.370 --> 32:39.576
I

32:12.370 --> 32:39.576
think that would be really good.

32:48.145 --> 33:10.140
Do

32:48.145 --> 33:10.140
you also like to come out and report on things that 
you did that you didn't report on? Is that one of the

33:10.160 --> 33:12.083
things that you started to do that you didn't like 
to come out and report on? No. I think it's

33:12.183 --> 33:13.485
important to work with people who you can tell 
them. And so we can... Yeah, I think that's a good

33:13.505 --> 33:14.507
idea.

33:18.503 --> 33:42.569
How

33:18.503 --> 33:42.569
do you like it? I like it. I like it. The

33:45.942 --> 34:03.266
only thing I'm really going to find out, I promise, 
would be if you give me the card. The what? The ID

34:03.487 --> 34:03.727
card. Can you give me the card? The ID card?

34:16.520 --> 34:38.308
um

34:16.520 --> 34:38.308
um I

34:40.195 --> 35:03.751
just assumed that he would just walk in. I would 
have had the option if he wanted to do it, but when

35:03.771 --> 35:05.393
the system goes down, . .

35:21.744 --> 35:32.699
.

35:32.719 --> 35:32.739
. . . . . Oh,

35:33.993 --> 35:48.049
yes, we have. Last

35:48.269 --> 35:52.854
verse, we can go back in. We can go a little further 
down. We can go a little further down. We can go a

35:55.117 --> 35:55.858
little further down. We can go a little further 
down. We can go a little further down. We can go a

35:57.199 --> 35:57.840
little further down. I'll have to do it. I'll have 
to do it. Okay. I mean, we'll try to do it. We'll try

36:11.561 --> 36:13.484
to do it. We'll try to do it. We'll try to do it. At 
least you

36:18.779 --> 36:38.984
have the control

36:18.779 --> 36:38.984
of knowing what kind of algorithm you're

36:18.779 --> 36:38.984
using. Is that what you mean by the type of 
algorithm you're using? Yes. How many computers

36:42.288 --> 36:42.948
do you have? Well, I don't know. Maybe... You found 
the answers, didn't you? If

36:46.235 --> 37:09.557
he wasn't,

36:46.235 --> 37:09.557
he would drown himself after all that happened. 
That's right. John, if you can't get up, why don't

37:09.857 --> 37:11.058
you go to the bathroom? I don't know. I think 
it's... It looks good on you. No, it's beautiful.

37:12.520 --> 37:12.900
It's not beautiful. Just

37:13.370 --> 37:37.031
a

37:13.370 --> 37:37.031
minute,

37:13.370 --> 37:37.031
let me get one more chart. Yeah, that might be 
helpful. Because, like, I had a dog, and I found a

37:37.772 --> 37:39.774
new home at the church yesterday, and it was so, so 
nice. And this is my site, and I just got it. And, um,

37:40.595 --> 37:42.496
I scanned the number, and it popped in the 
calendar, and it was two different numbers. Well,

37:42.516 --> 37:43.157
I see our numbers as well.

37:47.407 --> 38:10.660
And

37:47.407 --> 38:10.660
so I had

37:47.407 --> 38:10.660
to put in a call meeting to round out if that number 
fit and told me who the caller was. And we had to

38:10.680 --> 38:11.180
charge him. I had to find him to get a notice. But I 
said, you know, I couldn't be sure if that came

38:11.901 --> 38:13.143
through. I always send my phone right to him. So we 
have our conference. Do you have any other

38:14.445 --> 38:15.126
information? Do you have any other information?

38:18.710 --> 38:34.558
Thank

38:18.710 --> 38:34.558
you.
