00:15.725 --> 00:21.673
Now, after you go back to Cambridge, then, you stay 
there for a while. And what next? Well, I stayed at

00:23.376 --> 00:26.300
Cambridge until I retired. And then every summer, 
I came here to La Jolla for two to three months. I was

00:34.972 --> 00:40.260
a professor here and a professor in Cambridge, 
which is probably contrary to the regulations of

00:34.972 --> 00:40.260
both universities. And then when I retired from 
Cambridge, I moved here. Partly because I

00:46.015 --> 00:54.626
couldn't work in Cambridge, I couldn't get a job, 
and partly for tax reasons. What you said just now,

00:56.769 --> 01:02.836
a few thoughts on what you said just before we 
started recording. You said that people didn't

01:04.058 --> 01:15.432
always realize that the old fashioned views of 
history about the influence of individuals,

01:15.833 --> 01:19.438
still had, in fact, an element of truth in them. The 
pendulum had swung a long way in the other

01:19.558 --> 01:23.484
direction under Marxist influence. It was 
believed that the economic environment and the

01:25.427 --> 01:38.065
needs of the ruling class were the predominant 
thing, almost to the exclusion of the individual.

01:38.906 --> 01:45.756
And the pendulum is now swinging back, and I think 
most people would probably agree that Marxist

01:46.478 --> 02:12.992
ideas of the influence of the ruling class on what 
actually gets done and the importance of the

01:46.478 --> 02:12.992
economics of the thing are one side of the picture 
but of course if you now say how does this thing work

01:46.478 --> 02:12.992
itself out in practice why are things done in one 
place and not another then you do have the

01:46.478 --> 02:12.992
influence of the people and this is very important 
because it's It's relevant to education. I mean,

02:15.452 --> 02:20.479
what kind of people are you trying to educate? The 
idea of education now is to a great extent to push a

02:21.040 --> 02:37.702
lot of information in, test to see it, look through 
a hole and test to see it's still there, and then

02:21.040 --> 02:37.702
give people a degree quickly before it spills out. 
And I think what you said, and a sense in which there

02:43.330 --> 02:51.382
are certain kinds of people who do in fact get 
things done. And this is not necessarily an

02:51.402 --> 02:56.670
entirely intellectual question. It's a question 
of character, frame of mind, even of the way you're

02:56.690 --> 03:03.260
brought up. I mean, Rutherford, for instance, 
was, as I said last time, I think, looked at himself

03:03.280 --> 03:12.173
as a farmer's boy. In a sense, what one might call a 
liberated person. That's to say, he knew what he

03:16.066 --> 03:18.549
wanted. He thought he ought to have it. He had a 
conviction that what he was doing was worthwhile

03:19.930 --> 03:25.136
and the right thing. And this is very striking in 
Ewing. The certainty that what he wanted to do was

03:28.199 --> 03:34.685
what the Lord would have done. And I think this is 
extremely important. The development of a

03:41.498 --> 03:45.042
self-confidence in persons in positions of 
leadership. If they just go along doing what they

03:46.143 --> 04:05.424
did for their PhD, you see almost the majority of 
scientists do something for their PhD and go on

03:46.143 --> 04:05.424
doing the same thing and don't sort of get out of it 
and are continually on the defensive about this

03:46.143 --> 04:05.424
matter still being important. I found a whole 
group of people in Yale recently doing what I did

04:08.988 --> 04:12.111
for my PhD on electron scattering. And the subject 
didn't seem to change very much. The techniques

04:14.674 --> 04:16.796
were a bit better. But how anyone, a young man, 
could go into this, I find it difficult to believe.

04:22.361 --> 04:24.683
Anyway, I'm sure this is mostly my ignorance. The 
group is probably doing something useful. But the

04:28.287 --> 04:38.877
idea, when I say liberated, I mean this, that you 
see what you want to do, you consider what you need

04:28.287 --> 04:38.877
to do it, not what you think you can get. That if you 
have some great scheme for going to Mars, you

04:41.180 --> 04:50.350
shouldn't say to yourself, I can't do this, I 
shan't be able to get the money. You should say, now

04:50.931 --> 04:53.053
what does this cost? Have a realistic idea of what 
is needed to do it, and then if you really think it's

04:53.814 --> 05:03.004
worthwhile, go and try and find someone who will 
make it possible to do it. And I think the thing that

05:03.645 --> 05:08.290
modern education lacks to some extent Is the 
developing in people a self-confidence?

05:16.468 --> 05:24.099
It's all concerned not with the old-fashioned 
character development, but with the acquisition

05:16.468 --> 05:24.099
of knowledge. I mean, there's so much more 
knowledge to acquire now. This is obviously a line

05:26.663 --> 05:30.609
of least resistance. And I've always tried with 
graduate students to get them to want to do

05:31.390 --> 05:36.437
something. to come to me and say, what I'd like to do 
is this. And I say, well, then, all right, let's do

05:39.949 --> 05:41.671
it. You get out a plan for doing it. How big a ship do 
you need? How many people do you need? What do you

05:46.497 --> 05:47.378
need to do? And then find the money. And sometimes 
these PhD problems can cost hundreds of thousands

05:50.582 --> 05:53.906
of dollars. And one should try and make young 
people believe Not that one is very short of money

05:59.873 --> 06:08.246
and has to be very careful, you know, like many 
professors are, but to make them believe there's

05:59.873 --> 06:08.246
lots of money in the world, let's go out and get it. I 
think there is an important way in which the

06:09.648 --> 06:20.745
director of a research group can do this sort of 
semi-psychological education. It's a kind of

06:20.765 --> 06:25.392
character development, a view of the world, And of 
course undergraduates like this too. If you're

06:27.761 --> 06:34.257
lecturing to undergraduates, they love these 
stories about blowing up ships. And

06:34.778 --> 06:38.026
unfortunately we broke the ship in the middle of 
this kind of thing. The rather cheerful attitude

06:38.046 --> 06:42.857
to life that you can't make omelettes without 
breaking eggs. Someone told me the other day that

06:44.153 --> 06:49.740
it was Lenin who first said, you can't make onwards 
without breaking eggs. Is this really true? I

06:50.701 --> 06:51.322
don't know. I've never heard that accredited to 
him. I don't think it's true, but I found it

06:53.064 --> 06:57.049
somewhere the other day. I think it can't be true. 
It's a phrase I've always known. Me too, and it

07:00.793 --> 07:03.056
doesn't sound as something Lenin would say. It 
doesn't sound like that, no. He said it apropos

07:04.978 --> 07:07.341
shooting people. Okay, that's right. I mean, 
bloody murderer and wanted an excuse for shooting

07:08.222 --> 07:12.928
people. He probably said you can't make forms 
unless you kill Kulaks. That would sound more

07:18.584 --> 07:20.686
sense to me.

07:25.190 --> 07:33.238
Well, now, when you retire then from Cambridge, 
you come here permanently to work, partially

07:25.190 --> 07:33.238
because you can work here and... I'm on a 
year-to-year contract, yeah? And I'm getting

07:35.860 --> 07:42.747
paid six months of the year, and the other six 
months I make my living by my wits. And this in

07:43.655 --> 08:00.077
Cambridge, I mean, I could go on, I suppose, doing 
my own work in Cambridge, but here I can do some

07:43.655 --> 08:00.077
teaching, have some graduate students, and the 
discontinuity on retiring is much less here than

07:43.655 --> 08:00.077
it is in Cambridge. Cambridge is frightened of 
making any distinction between people, so they

08:00.237 --> 08:10.270
have a fixed retiring age cut, and it would be quite 
foreign to their feelings to... say Mr. A can stay

08:10.570 --> 08:14.135
on for another year and Mr. B can't. On the same 
grounds, they pay all professors equally. Okay.

08:19.043 --> 08:21.747
What about the tax structure in England? I don't 
want to talk about the tax structure in England. I

08:24.051 --> 08:31.041
will just say this, that my pension from Cambridge 
is a lump sum of money, and I have to invest that to

08:24.051 --> 08:31.041
get a pension. After the first thousand pounds, 
this is taxed at 50%, and the tax goes up to 98%. And

08:38.836 --> 08:41.540
I'm not going to live in a country that does that to 
them. Well, the reason I was asking is we have been

08:41.560 --> 08:56.601
fortunate in this country to be able to attract a 
goodly number of people from Britain and England

08:41.560 --> 08:56.601
in particular because the tax structure has been 
so... Well, of course, now, just at this moment, of

08:41.560 --> 08:56.601
course, you could attract an indefinite number of 
people. But, of course, you can't get them

08:57.142 --> 08:59.825
residence visas. Yeah, right. You can't get them 
labor permits. That's right. Actually, you can

09:04.520 --> 09:07.144
usually do it a year at a time. You get them an H1 visa 
a year at a time. It's just taken me 16 months to get a

09:09.748 --> 09:13.194
residence visa. You've no idea what the 
documentation is like. Everyone's very charming

09:15.638 --> 09:24.272
and nice about it, but clearly the whole process is 
so complicated as to constitute an intelligence

09:15.638 --> 09:24.272
case.

09:27.277 --> 09:27.557
Now... You have continued your work on here, then, 
oceanography. Now, I have a series of questions,

09:31.836 --> 09:37.041
if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you that are sort 
of what-if questions. All right? If you had to name

09:38.683 --> 09:45.870
what you consider your greatest single 
scientific contribution, and I realize that's a

09:38.683 --> 09:45.870
terrible question, what would you name? Oh, dear, 
oh, dear, oh, dear.

09:51.436 --> 09:55.300
I think I know what other people would say. They 
would probably say the heat flow work.

10:00.216 --> 10:00.997
Absolutely. My own feeling is that it is to have 
provided the atmosphere and the opportunity for

10:01.558 --> 10:13.255
the group that nailed down continental drift. I 
made contributions to it myself, particularly

10:13.435 --> 10:23.189
the taking seriously Wegener's idea of the fits of 
the continents in the past. At the same time, I

10:23.910 --> 10:25.793
forgot to mention it, At the same time as the other 
work was going on, I was working with two graduate

10:26.093 --> 10:37.905
students on seeing whether North America and 
Greenland would fit into Europe and South America

10:26.093 --> 10:37.905
into Africa. And we found the fit was incomparably 
better than anyone had expected. Also, I think,

10:43.170 --> 10:52.219
the reason I hesitated was that I was, in fact, the 
first person to do seismic shooting at sea with the

10:52.570 --> 10:58.078
instruments not on the bottom, which is a very 
necessary discovery. It would have been

10:58.098 --> 11:08.553
discovered almost at once by other people, but I 
was in fact the first to do it, because it's very

10:58.098 --> 11:08.553
difficult to put instruments on the bottom of the 
deep sea, and rather easy to put them near the

10:58.098 --> 11:08.553
surface. Well, I mean, it's an unanswerable 
question, it doesn't make much sense really, but

11:10.636 --> 11:17.346
I'd have thought the building up of this group in 
Cambridge that made this great contribution to

11:17.765 --> 11:22.810
the modern ideas.

11:31.478 --> 11:34.240
Teaching at Scripps, how do you find American 
students? Well, I have great fun teaching at

11:35.001 --> 11:38.364
Scripps. I enjoy it enormously. I teach a first 
year course on the earth to non-scientists. So

11:46.047 --> 11:47.268
we've got all kinds of people. As a matter of fact, 
I've noticed as the years go by that we get a larger

11:47.329 --> 11:52.795
and larger proportion of scientists in it. They 
sort of creep in out of the woodwork. It's

11:56.279 --> 12:02.266
directed, in principle, at non-scientists who 
want to do one course in science. And these

12:03.507 --> 12:15.902
students I find absolutely charming, most 
delightful people, extremely appreciative,

12:03.507 --> 12:15.902
very nice to me personally, always come and talk to 
me afterwards. very restrained in expressing

12:16.237 --> 12:24.188
their troubles if they don't get good grades and so 
on. Really very nice people. Their main trouble is

12:27.092 --> 12:29.855
they can't write at all. I mean, they're hardly 
literate, which is very surprising for arts

12:29.875 --> 12:34.582
people. I talked about this last time. I would say 
the outstanding defect of American education at

12:36.685 --> 12:42.132
the moment is not to teach writing. People can 
read, but they can't write. They aren't, of

12:45.970 --> 12:48.174
course, very good at speaking either. The 
standard of public speaking in America is not

12:48.334 --> 12:54.364
high, with a few well-known exceptions. But on the 
whole, if you put a student on to make an

12:54.464 --> 13:01.295
after-dinner speech or something, it's pretty 
lamentable. Well, the other side I know is the

13:01.315 --> 13:07.945
graduate students, of course. The graduate 
students are extremely well-informed, I think

13:07.965 --> 13:13.294
much better informed, than our English students. 
They know more. Partly because they have to do

13:17.021 --> 13:19.905
courses as graduate students. You see, we have a 
three-year undergraduate course, so the

13:19.925 --> 13:25.873
transition from school to a graduate student is 
three years. And when they become graduate

13:26.914 --> 13:37.488
students, there are courses they can go to, but 
they don't go to them, and they don't have to go to

13:26.914 --> 13:37.488
them, and they don't have any exam. What they have 
to do is do a piece of original work, write a thesis

13:38.089 --> 13:41.914
on it, and pass an oral exam on the thesis and on the 
general subject in which it falls. And I described

13:47.292 --> 13:49.414
my own oral exam last time. The idea of the general 
subject in which it falls is fairly wide. But they

13:53.698 --> 13:58.242
don't have any more examinations on courses. So 
that I think your students, when they've got their

13:58.262 --> 14:08.011
PhDs, know more than us do. I think This amount of 
formal teaching is a little inhibiting of the sort

14:09.620 --> 14:16.167
of freedom I was talking about. The sort of 
optimism and belief that you can do anything,

14:18.670 --> 14:27.700
which I learned partly from Rutherford and partly 
from the war. I mean, the war is a thing which had an

14:28.581 --> 14:39.053
enormous and I think almost entirely favorable 
influence on scientists, and which the present

14:28.581 --> 14:39.053
generation has missed, of course. I mean a whole 
generation. It was a thing in which it gave you

14:42.115 --> 14:51.966
confidence because what you were doing was 
regarded as important and not as an eccentric

14:42.115 --> 14:51.966
hobby. And I think part of this drift towards 
applied and relevant projects is an effort to find

14:53.447 --> 15:05.040
a way of working which will be acceptable to the 
society, in which you will be regarded as a

15:05.307 --> 15:12.619
valuable and useful member of society. And I think 
this is a good thing. I think the ivory tower,

15:14.763 --> 15:21.174
things like particle physics, if I were a young man 
I wouldn't go into particle physics. Dreadful

15:21.654 --> 15:25.160
subject. Very high prestige in scientific 
circles, but not outside.

15:32.493 --> 15:38.219
There's a very, many scientists who have a very 
restricted idea of what is interesting, of

15:32.493 --> 15:38.219
course. I mean, questions like the safety of 
nuclear power stations, disposal of nuclear

15:38.239 --> 15:45.768
waste. A serious interest in these matters is 
almost not science.

15:56.359 --> 16:02.466
Do you believe then, is it fair to say, that a good 
oceanographer is also a generalist in science?

16:03.104 --> 16:04.608
Oh, you've got to be a generalist. You asked me 
yesterday whether I thought people were more

16:04.788 --> 16:15.754
specialized, and I said no, I thought they had to be 
much less specialized, because the subjects are

16:04.788 --> 16:15.754
much less clearly demarcated. I mean, if we take 
oceanography, for example, This whole subject,

16:19.523 --> 16:29.957
which I've spent my life developing largely, of 
the study of the bottom of the ocean, marine

16:19.523 --> 16:29.957
geology, this has connections in all directions. 
It's obviously got connections with geology.

16:32.761 --> 16:35.766
It's got connections with the traditional 
oceanography. I mean, the sense of sedimentation

16:35.786 --> 16:42.595
and all the techniques of dealing with things 
covered by several miles of water. And it's got

16:42.575 --> 16:44.517
connections with physics. Now we've got global 
theories. We have to develop mechanisms. What is

16:48.181 --> 16:49.883
it that moves the continents? All these kinds of 
things. So you're connected with everything from

16:51.544 --> 16:59.112
the most difficult theoretical physics to 
orthodox geology. And the things have become

16:59.213 --> 17:01.675
unstuck. That when I was young, geology was a 
complete thing with a ring around it. You could say

17:05.399 --> 17:06.801
what was geology. It was in practice defined as 
something we did with a hammer and a microscope.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.963
and now it's become connected with everything 
else. Okay, now what I wanted to do was use that as a

17:16.065 --> 17:19.270
lead-in question. I note that in your, well, in 
what has been written about you, you list yourself

17:19.290 --> 17:27.281
as, in effect, belonging to no political party. I 
just don't say anything about it. Okay, that's

17:30.046 --> 17:31.788
fine. I wondered if you thought, as a scientist who 
is a generalist, that you ought to express

17:36.052 --> 17:39.676
opinions on things like nuclear waste. I'm 
extremely interested in politics, in fact. But no

17:43.479 --> 17:48.204
one who's looking for an American visa is going to 
say what their politics are, whatever they are. My

17:48.504 --> 17:59.756
politics are, in fact, to the right of center 
Republican in American terms, right-wing

17:48.504 --> 17:59.756
conservative in English terms. I was, for a long 
while, very willing to put up with Nixon on the

18:03.440 --> 18:10.706
grounds that I preferred a knave to a fool. He 
seemed to me, he turned out eventually to be both a

18:10.906 --> 18:14.590
knave and a fool. But for a while, I thought he was 
just a knave, which seemed to me relatively

18:15.310 --> 18:18.813
harmless. But anyway, I would say, if Ford can be 
said to have a position, I thought that was about

18:19.654 --> 18:28.101
fine. But of course, he is rather extremely 
non-intellectual. I'm certainly to the right of

18:32.870 --> 18:39.699
Rockefeller and certainly to the left of 
Bellwater, this sort of position. Well, now, I've

18:39.719 --> 18:47.490
taken great interest in a tremendous amount of 
time and trouble over questions connected with

18:39.719 --> 18:47.490
disarmament. I've been a British delegate at 
Geneva. I was a member of the experts conference in

18:49.573 --> 18:52.677
58 at Geneva. I've been a member of the Pogwash 
affair for many, many years.

19:01.507 --> 19:06.071
all kinds of committees connected with 
disarmament agreements with the Russians. I've

19:06.932 --> 19:10.155
also been closely connected with defense. I think 
I mentioned last time, I was chairman of the

19:11.236 --> 19:21.104
Anglo-American Ballistic Missiles Committee, 
which was for a while a body of some significance.

19:21.124 --> 19:23.927
And so I have spent quite a lot of time on this. I'm 
not, however, a joiner. I generally don't sign

19:26.309 --> 19:28.651
things. You know, there are always protests about 
someone having shot someone in Uganda, or someone

19:31.460 --> 19:40.791
having failed to let a Jew out of Russia, or those 
endless protest things. And if you once start

19:40.851 --> 19:55.027
signing these, you get yourself typed in the 
public mind, and if you aren't extremely careful,

19:40.851 --> 19:55.027
you'll find you've in effect joined some 
crypto-communist movement. A lot of these things

19:55.047 --> 19:58.952
are simply concealed lawsuits of the Communist 
Party. And so I've systematically refused to sign

19:59.371 --> 20:08.383
any of these appeals that are published in the 
newspapers and so on. But I have belonged to

20:08.403 --> 20:11.748
official bodies for many years. I was a member of 
the Foreign Office Committee on Disarmament and

20:11.908 --> 20:18.437
all these. I was a member of the Institute of 
Strategic Studies for a good many years, so I got

20:18.497 --> 20:24.044
bored with it. I'm not, in the ordinary sense, 
politically active, but I've I'm really an , you

20:29.577 --> 20:33.722
might say. That's to say, if I'd taken a little more 
trouble about it and been a little more

20:33.742 --> 20:56.850
interested, I would probably have been like Jerry 
Wiesner or Solly Zuckerman and been advisor to

20:33.742 --> 20:56.850
some president or prime minister or something and 
sort of sat in a back room and been generally

20:33.742 --> 20:56.850
regarded as a nefarious influence. But I never had 
the time, really, to devote to that. I have spent a

21:02.814 --> 21:05.818
lot of time talking to politicians and advising 
them. Now, I had wanted to ask you some things about

21:06.599 --> 21:10.063
your international commitments. Really, I want 
to ask you three things about them. First of all,

21:12.567 --> 21:23.260
are you optimistic in terms of future development 
of the seas about international cooperation in

21:12.567 --> 21:23.260
oceanography? Oh, dear. Of course, you've got two 
conflicting tendencies. On the whole, the

21:31.931 --> 21:40.920
developed countries are interested in 
collaborating in a tremendous task, which is

21:31.931 --> 21:40.920
clearly a global task, and can't be done locally. 
And so far as the Japanese, the Americans, the

21:40.940 --> 21:50.690
Canadians, Western Europe, British, there is no 
problem. And the Russians, there is no problem.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.335
The troubles come from the undeveloped countries 
who for easily understandable reasons regard

21:56.585 --> 22:22.525
anything which is done by the developed countries 
as being an attempt to steal something from them

21:56.585 --> 22:22.525
and therefore their tendency is to get control of 
as much as possible and keep the developed

21:56.585 --> 22:22.525
countries out till such a time as they've 
developed their own understanding and

21:56.585 --> 22:22.525
technology and this is the back

22:25.559 --> 22:27.542
of the Conference on the Law of the Sea. It's been 
promoted by the undeveloped countries very

22:28.103 --> 22:31.008
largely. The Americans, the British, and the 
Russians would much rather the whole thing didn't

22:31.589 --> 22:37.438
happen, because we're doing quite well as it is. 
But all these other countries are trying to

22:38.139 --> 22:47.574
produce restrictive arrangements, and I think 
it's difficult to judge how it comes out. I find it

22:47.674 --> 22:52.562
difficult to believe that the developed 
countries will give in

22:57.773 --> 22:59.359
If necessary, they won't sign the treaty. You see, 
if you had to get permission from the nearest

23:00.924 --> 23:09.032
country every time you operated at sea, it would be 
impossible to operate. I mean, you'd have to say

23:09.383 --> 23:14.591
exactly what you were going to do months and months 
and months beforehand. You'd often get refused at

23:14.611 --> 23:18.817
the last minute if you just kill oceanography as a 
science. And it may happen that the governments of

23:19.498 --> 23:29.854
the United States and Western Europe decide to 
throw the scientists to the wolves in return for

23:19.498 --> 23:29.854
some other concession. But I don't think they 
will. I've spent a lot of time talking to the

23:33.680 --> 23:37.045
Foreign Office people about this. and I know 
something about the corresponding negotiations

23:37.801 --> 23:42.728
in this country and Canada. Canada has behaved 
very badly and is tending to join the undeveloped

23:43.208 --> 23:50.839
countries over this for reasons that are very 
difficult to tell. I've had endless

23:50.859 --> 23:56.707
correspondence with the Canadians about this, 
and I just do not know why they're being so foolish.

23:57.348 --> 24:01.293
Now, that really, in fact, answers my second 
question, which had to do with the 200-mile limit.

24:01.353 --> 24:03.757
What sort of effect did you think that would have on 
the country? Well, it depends, you see, what you

24:03.777 --> 24:07.622
mean by the limit. I think it is inevitable that we 
are going to have a 200 mile limit. I don't see that

24:13.204 --> 24:15.947
there's any way out of this. I think the conference 
won't agree, and we'll have unilateral

24:16.067 --> 24:21.714
declarations of 200 mile limits. And I don't see as 
much anyone can do about it. We've got to live with

24:23.456 --> 24:24.978
it. This largely closes work on the continental 
shelves. And I can understand the desire of, well,

24:29.803 --> 24:36.411
of course, so far as mineral resources is 
concerned, is not very different from the 58

24:36.863 --> 24:46.334
Treaty, the Treaty on the Continental Shelf. In 
any case, the nearest land has control of the

24:46.834 --> 24:52.380
exploitation of mineral resources. Well, 
they're clearly also going to take fishing rights

24:53.141 --> 25:03.833
after those distances, I think, and I fear they're 
going to take a thing which is no justification at

24:53.141 --> 25:03.833
all in international law, That is control of 
scientific investigations within these units.

25:08.696 --> 25:20.689
This, at the moment, on the continental shelf in 
Western Europe, whatever the international law

25:08.696 --> 25:20.689
may be, we have an arrangement by which the 
countries on both sides of the Peace of Sea Concern

25:08.696 --> 25:20.689
give notice. And this works quite well. They just 
give notice, the Foreign Office circulates the

25:22.210 --> 25:29.237
plans, and anyone who wishes to object can object. 
The thing looked like becoming a nuisance at one

25:29.257 --> 25:31.279
time. They were circulating them and requiring 
you to say you didn't object. I persuaded them that

25:34.492 --> 25:38.156
they only needed a reply who did object. And this 
ensures practically that no one ever does. And

25:40.759 --> 25:41.921
this is working very well. But I think it's going to 
be impossible to do work of any sort within 200

25:42.721 --> 25:48.268
miles of any undeveloped country. Well, we may 
just have to put up with this. And I think in some

25:52.513 --> 25:58.339
cases, such as Argentina, one can reach 
agreements with them, bilateral agreements for

25:52.513 --> 25:58.339
doing things. In the case of Chile, at the moment 
you could. Three or four years ago you couldn't.

26:04.580 --> 26:10.408
They'll ask for, in the African case, they'll ask 
for concessions, money, something of the kind.

26:11.149 --> 26:14.573
But, of course, it still leaves most of the deep sea 
free for investigation. What I'm terrified of is

26:14.593 --> 26:18.398
an agreement about investigation in the deep sea. 
What sort of an agreement? Well, an agreement, I

26:21.622 --> 26:31.195
imagine it would be an agreement by which one, 
there was an international body run by the UN from

26:21.622 --> 26:31.195
whom we had to get permission, which I think would 
be intolerable. Well, now then, the third of these

26:32.086 --> 26:35.549
questions in this series, if I may. Do you foresee, 
in effect, more cooperation between industrial

26:37.251 --> 26:44.517
countries in broad-scale oceanographic 
ventures or less? Well, I think so far as the

26:46.939 --> 27:00.051
government and academic community is concerned, 
I should have thought the collaboration is

26:46.939 --> 27:00.051
already very extensive and will continue.

27:04.587 --> 27:07.632
French project with a considerable British input 
as well. And almost all oceanographic

27:08.774 --> 27:14.204
expeditions are to some extent international. I 
mean here in Scripps they borrowed a Canadian ship

27:15.006 --> 27:26.967
recently and there are all kinds of very free and 
easy interchange and the deep sea drilling

27:15.006 --> 27:26.967
project is now an international project. That was 
partly, of course, to ease the effects of

27:27.335 --> 27:32.563
restrictions. It's easier to get permission for 
an international project over an area claimed by

27:32.883 --> 27:41.396
some other state than it is for a national project. 
So I'd have thought that, partly because things

27:41.476 --> 27:50.829
are expensive, partly because it is in its nature 
international, that the very satisfactory

27:41.476 --> 27:50.829
international collaboration would go on. If you 
start to develop

27:56.579 --> 28:01.804
commercial things on the ocean floor, then of 
course there are rather different

27:56.579 --> 28:01.804
considerations. If it's very expensive, then 
they may be glad of collaboration from firms in

28:02.385 --> 28:08.991
various parts of the world. If you feel you can 
finance it yourself, you'll obviously do it

28:09.572 --> 28:12.735
yourself. The military things would only be 
collaboration between allies. I mean, I think

28:17.840 --> 28:21.643
it's unlikely we'll collaborate with the 
Russians over military things. So it is one of my

28:21.663 --> 28:24.426
views that we should encourage um relations of a 
technical kind connected with military affairs

28:24.727 --> 28:53.299
with the russians because the most dangerous 
thing is misapprehensions and if you wish for

28:24.727 --> 28:53.299
example to have means of detection of the motion of 
ships over the ocean then there's something to be

28:24.727 --> 28:53.299
said for having a joint a joint arrangement with 
the russians so you both have the same information

28:24.727 --> 28:53.299
you can always add your own domestic system as well 
if you want to but i i'm not sure that the absolute

28:54.038 --> 29:01.416
separation of the two opposing sides in their 
technical measures is sensible
