WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:05.248
So they could break down into groups of fours?

00:05.369 --> 00:15.930
For most of your anatomy classes and surgery and your physiology and everything, you worked in groups of fours.

00:16.450 --> 00:21.337
Describe, in general, those 64 people.

00:22.358 --> 00:25.843
Well, they were all male.

00:27.045 --> 00:37.159
There were some veterans, of course.

00:37.139 --> 00:51.057
In my class there were two or three PhDs that had come in from other disciplines and we had a good class, I mean academic class.

00:51.097 --> 00:53.600
Were they urban or rural in background?

00:53.621 --> 00:58.607
Probably, probably

01:00.427 --> 01:05.974
If I had to guess, maybe half and half rural and urban, probably.

01:06.335 --> 01:07.156
All from Texas?

01:08.057 --> 01:09.579
All from, no, no.

01:09.619 --> 01:11.402
We had eight from Louisiana.

01:11.442 --> 01:17.410
We took, Louisiana didn't have veterinary school, so we reciprocated.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.993
We took eight Louisiana students every year.

01:21.095 --> 01:28.965
And what percentage of them had an A&M undergraduate background?

01:30.903 --> 01:38.291
Well, of course, the eight from Louisiana didn't.

01:41.855 --> 01:56.590
We had several University of Texas people, but I'd say the majority of them, two-thirds anyhow, were A&M graduates.

01:56.840 --> 02:01.066
How were y'all, describe how the first year began.

02:01.126 --> 02:02.228
How were you welcomed?

02:02.929 --> 02:04.952
How did you get oriented?

02:05.493 --> 02:11.662
Well, the first year for me was a very traumatic experience, the first day.

02:11.682 --> 02:21.497
I came back out of the service, and everybody at that time, when I left to go in the service for,

02:21.477 --> 02:26.643
I wore Levi's and boots and so forth.

02:26.703 --> 02:41.080
I came back the first day to go to class and found out everybody had to be in whites and there would be no western boots and etc.

02:42.562 --> 02:45.105
I didn't know where to go to class.

02:46.267 --> 02:54.225
So I didn't muster out until August 23rd or 25th of that year.

02:54.405 --> 03:05.490
So I tried to find my first class and ended up over at a little building called the Anatomy Building.

03:05.470 --> 03:23.583
When I got there an hour or so late, all the students were four in a group, and the blackboards went all the way around the room, were completely filled with a process of bone formation written out by one Al Price.

03:25.446 --> 03:28.812
And so I started out way behind.

03:29.686 --> 03:38.762
I didn't know anybody in my class, and it was all very, very new.

03:40.165 --> 03:44.913
I stayed in the veterinary medicine about a week, and I went home and told my wife.

03:45.014 --> 03:48.640
I had a brand-new two-bust old baby.

03:49.582 --> 03:55.650
Well, to my wife, I didn't think I was going to stay and go through this nonsense.

03:57.172 --> 03:58.333
But I did stay.

03:58.634 --> 04:00.376
And where were you all living?

04:01.037 --> 04:03.159
We were living on Cooner Street.

04:03.279 --> 04:13.092
I couldn't get into Veterans House, so I bought a little house on Cooner Street.

04:13.072 --> 04:19.484
Remember the interest rate on it was 3 1⁄4 or 2 1⁄4 GI Bill.

04:19.965 --> 04:21.828
This is K-O-O-N-E-R?

04:22.910 --> 04:26.617
No, C-O-O-N-E-R.

04:26.677 --> 04:27.399
Where is that?

04:28.040 --> 04:33.510
That is now...

04:33.490 --> 04:52.280
is right there where the, I think it's the Fairfield Motel or Hotel or something, right over off of Texas Avenue there.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.604
Serapis used to be back in there.

04:56.558 --> 05:11.260
And this class that you walked into that Dr. Price was doing, what about some of the other classes that first year, that first fall?

05:11.662 --> 05:19.853
Well, that class I walked into that morning, again, everybody was divided up into fours.

05:21.536 --> 05:37.618
And so they had, there was one group of three until I got there, and so I was automatically went into a group, and I knew none of them.

05:37.598 --> 05:51.074
Of that group of four of us, two of them are dead and one of them still, John Huff still teaches here at the veterinary school.

05:52.817 --> 06:03.049
We took anatomy, gross anatomy and histology and biochemistry and

06:04.936 --> 06:14.752
Let me see, we had Dr. Price and Dr. Melleff and biochemistry.

06:14.772 --> 06:19.139
Who else, what else we had this semester?

06:19.159 --> 06:20.802
We had growth anatomy.

06:22.250 --> 06:38.753
I don't remember whether we took physiology that first semester or not, but first two years was always about the same.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.136
The first year

06:41.116 --> 06:51.529
There was always a growth anatomy and microscopic anatomy and physiology and biochemistry.

06:51.829 --> 07:06.988
And next year you went into physiology and microbiology and embryology.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.710
histology.

07:10.192 --> 07:11.953
And it was a four-year curriculum?

07:12.434 --> 07:13.896
Four-year curriculum.

07:13.916 --> 07:19.682
It took an average of 20 hours, 21 hours a semester.

07:20.202 --> 07:31.795
Now that first lecture with Dr. Price that scared you, describe Al Price as a teacher.

07:32.078 --> 07:37.248
Oh, he was an exceptional teacher.

07:38.130 --> 07:50.914
Just like all of our, we had about seven professors that were core professors then that really made the veterinary school what it is.

07:50.894 --> 08:08.160
Of course, you had Price, and you had Milliff, and you had Turk, and you had Burns, and you had Jaggi, and you had Leonard, and you had Beamer.

08:08.140 --> 08:13.328
That group, they were all educators.

08:14.350 --> 08:23.504
There were no research people in it, and they were the real core to their school and what it finally became.

08:27.831 --> 08:30.435
Describe each of those, if you would.

08:30.550 --> 08:57.739
Well, Dr. Price was younger of the group and he had come out of the military and he was very articulate and well-versed and gross anatomy and

08:59.137 --> 09:04.067
Then Dr. Turk was... Why did y'all call him Slick Al?

09:04.537 --> 09:18.589
Well, that was because I guess he was very verbal and articulate.

09:19.190 --> 09:22.913
And he was made sure that you were also.

09:23.914 --> 09:26.016
And he was very strict.

09:26.036 --> 09:27.937
In no way was that a put down.

09:27.957 --> 09:28.278
Oh, no.

09:28.558 --> 09:29.138
That's what I thought.

09:29.158 --> 09:30.159
No, no, no.

09:31.741 --> 09:34.543
At that time, 92 was an A.

09:34.523 --> 09:52.391
And if you had a 91.4, you were going to make a B. And they took a little pride in, not pride, but see how many failures they could have.

09:52.431 --> 09:57.920
If you failed a course in veterinary school, you were out.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.143
You'd just fail any one course.

10:01.777 --> 10:09.949
So then there was Dr. Turk, who was a Kansas City Veterinary College graduate.

10:09.969 --> 10:18.201
He couldn't hear anything, went through vet school reading lips, and he taught parasitology.

10:18.662 --> 10:19.583
Did he have a nickname?

10:25.131 --> 10:26.373
No, I don't think so.

10:26.413 --> 10:27.675
I don't believe I've ever heard of him.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.117
No, I don't think so.

10:30.430 --> 10:40.457
And then there was Dr. Milliff, John Milliff, who taught histology.

10:41.652 --> 10:51.883
embryology and had done his advanced work at the University of Texas in Galveston.

10:53.545 --> 10:56.368
Now he had a nickname, didn't he?

10:56.388 --> 10:57.509
Not that I know of.

10:57.529 --> 10:57.750
Oh really?

10:58.450 --> 11:08.301
Dr. Johns, all that he was ever called was Dr. Johns.

11:09.968 --> 11:12.935
Dr. Burns was called Pappy.

11:14.078 --> 11:22.398
He taught physiology, pharmacology, toxicology, you name it.

11:22.418 --> 11:26.408
And he had done advanced work

11:27.485 --> 11:29.448
University of Chicago, I think.

11:30.710 --> 11:44.211
Now, Miliff and Price and Burns were all A&M graduates.

11:46.351 --> 11:49.095
Leonard was an A&M graduate.

11:49.395 --> 11:50.777
A-N-H-A-R-D-T?

11:50.797 --> 11:54.362
No, L-E-N-N-E-R-T.

11:56.325 --> 12:10.705
He was taught medicine, large animal medicine and surgery, and was really, really a fine person.

12:10.685 --> 12:17.641
And then Beamer taught small animal medicine surgery.

12:17.661 --> 12:25.960
And Beamer, I think, was a—he may have been a Kansas State graduate.

12:27.475 --> 12:34.486
And then we had a guy who taught public health named Jaggi, Fred Jaggi.

12:35.487 --> 12:41.176
That was probably the most boresome of all courses we'd ever taken.

12:42.538 --> 12:48.006
It was really a hygiene course more than anything.

12:48.026 --> 12:50.410
As you look back, which was the most interesting course?

12:52.012 --> 12:53.955
Oh...

12:55.370 --> 13:01.439
I guess, to me, physiology and pharmacology and microbiology.

13:02.400 --> 13:13.717
I never got real excited about anatomy, either growth or histology or pathology.

13:14.618 --> 13:22.110
If you were grading them for their classroom and laboratory instructional capability, who would get the highest?

13:22.130 --> 13:23.331
I'm not going to ask you the negative.

13:23.371 --> 13:25.174
Who would get the highest grades?

13:25.154 --> 13:50.470
Well, I guess Dr. John or Dr. Milliff and Dr. Price and probably Dr. McMurray and Dr. Davis and

13:52.103 --> 13:55.195
They would probably be

13:55.327 --> 14:02.334
Were there any courses that everybody dreaded because they were tough, just difficult to pass?

14:02.354 --> 14:02.755
Oh, yeah.

14:04.717 --> 14:09.202
Yeah, a large animal anatomy that Leon Gibbs taught.

14:09.222 --> 14:11.264
Everybody dreaded that.

14:11.404 --> 14:16.289
And then the toxicology course that Dr. Burns taught.

14:16.309 --> 14:22.836
Those were the two, I guess, that caused more fear than anything.

14:22.816 --> 14:30.425
And that first year, describe what was the typical routine of a class day?

14:30.786 --> 14:33.769
Classes were how long and what did you do?

14:33.809 --> 14:39.576
Well, we took 21 semester hours all the way through.

14:39.617 --> 14:47.406
So you can imagine that your class day was 8 to 5, which it was.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.690
And then we had classes on Saturday morning still, too.

14:52.593 --> 14:54.596
So how did you get to the campus?

14:54.776 --> 14:56.017
Did you have a car then?

14:56.037 --> 14:59.122
Yeah, I came out of the service, I had a car.

15:00.343 --> 15:03.768
I had a Bel Air Chevrolet Power Glitch.

15:05.170 --> 15:16.144
But it was very, very hard, especially being married and having a child.

15:16.124 --> 15:28.578
I usually got home about, started at 6 in the morning and then got home at 6 in the evening in the afternoon.

15:30.140 --> 15:34.485
And I really didn't have any time with my family.

15:34.605 --> 15:41.693
And then I went and studied until midnight or 1 every morning.

15:41.673 --> 15:47.179
And during that first year, did you develop some friendships in the vet school?

15:47.199 --> 15:54.468
Well, yes, especially with my lab group that you worked so closely with.

15:54.488 --> 15:56.750
But I developed lots of friendship.

15:58.412 --> 16:03.818
And I was freshman class president for some reason.

16:03.878 --> 16:07.402
I guess I was older or something.

16:07.823 --> 16:10.566
What were the responsibilities of that position?

16:10.850 --> 16:23.715
Oh, it was mainly just keeping the class informed of any activities and things such as that.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.605
I got pretty involved.

16:28.585 --> 16:51.893
I was class president for many years and was president of the AVMA, a student chapter, and set up all the programs for our AVMA student chapter, and did those kind of things.

16:53.155 --> 17:00.583
What did you and your wife and that youngster, what did you all do for relaxation?

17:02.993 --> 17:10.505
Well, again, we only had the one car in the family.

17:10.545 --> 17:23.524
And so Mary got the car one afternoon a week to do the grocery shopping.

17:24.786 --> 17:30.435
We never went anywhere, not with that baby.

17:30.415 --> 17:35.582
I don't know that we ever went to a movie or anything.

17:36.003 --> 17:39.467
Do you remember what your budget was?

17:39.547 --> 17:39.908
Yeah.

17:41.190 --> 17:46.036
Yeah, I came back on GI Bill, so I was getting $135 a month.

17:47.919 --> 17:54.668
It seemed like that's what it was, about $100.

17:55.171 --> 18:00.778
$135 a month, that paid for everything.

18:02.840 --> 18:10.450
I had mustered out with $2,000 in leave time and other benefits, and that's what I bought my house with.

18:11.952 --> 18:17.478
And then we lived on $135.

18:17.579 --> 18:19.681
And your wife was a full-time stay-at-home mother.

18:20.062 --> 18:20.402
Yeah.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.888
Did y'all become involved in church or anything here?

18:25.908 --> 18:32.181
No, we were, if we had any outside activity, it would have been church.

18:32.502 --> 18:33.183
Where did you go?

18:34.025 --> 18:36.910
A&M Church of Christ at the North Gate.

18:37.832 --> 18:40.157
Describe that congregation during those years.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.183
Oh, it was a congregation of

18:45.931 --> 18:52.162
Used to have about 200 in attendance, I suppose, and half of them were students.

18:55.848 --> 18:59.635
It was probably a young congregation.

18:59.655 --> 19:00.877
And the building was located?

19:01.518 --> 19:02.380
Church Street.

19:03.502 --> 19:05.425
It was torn down last week.

19:06.991 --> 19:11.258
Who was the minister during those years, or do you remember?

19:11.919 --> 19:31.092
Yeah, there was Mr. Fowler and Mr. Seay, S-E-A-Y, I think, and then a guy by the name of Mount Whitson.

19:32.776 --> 19:42.027
And you all went to services at the church how often?

19:42.047 --> 19:45.130
Sunday morning, Sunday afternoon, Wednesday evening.

19:46.993 --> 19:48.054
And Sunday school?

19:52.439 --> 19:54.521
Back to veterinary medicine.

19:57.044 --> 20:01.990
How did you come to end up in the specialty that you did?

20:03.050 --> 20:05.193
What influenced you there?

20:05.934 --> 20:15.906
Well, you mean where I finally pursued my advanced doctorate degree?

20:16.067 --> 20:17.028
Well, no, no.

20:17.108 --> 20:20.833
How did you decide that that was the field in which you were going to specialize?

20:20.853 --> 20:21.734
Oh, wasn't there medicine?

20:21.914 --> 20:22.715
No, no, no, no, no.

20:23.016 --> 20:24.197
You're a pharmacology, aren't you?

20:24.616 --> 20:28.443
Yeah, but you don't decide that.

20:28.884 --> 20:31.970
You didn't decide that when you were in the DVM program?

20:32.171 --> 20:32.772
No.

20:32.792 --> 20:33.393
Oh, okay.

20:33.734 --> 20:34.856
You don't.

20:35.096 --> 20:42.430
The DVM is just a general curriculum, and so you don't have any specialty areas.

20:43.693 --> 20:46.438
But I did work.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.393
Of course, I worked all the time.

20:50.494 --> 20:58.504
I mean, during school, and I was

20:59.868 --> 21:08.758
I worked for the entomology department the first several summers that I was in vet school.

21:08.778 --> 21:14.825
And then I worked for the physiology department during school.

21:16.026 --> 21:26.618
And then I was the county health inspector.

21:28.420 --> 21:42.922
my junior and senior year where I inspected all the stores in Braddock County that sold perishable products, and there were 85 of them or 87 of them.

21:42.942 --> 21:55.221
And I had to go once a month and check them for temperature and all that kind of stuff and their quality and cleanliness.

21:55.201 --> 21:59.126
I always worked through the whole process.

21:59.146 --> 22:07.578
What did you think, as you were in the DVM program, what did you think you were going to do professionally as a veterinarian?

22:09.661 --> 22:17.732
Well, I thought I would probably enter a mixed practice.

22:19.231 --> 22:22.056
which I did in Beaumont.

22:23.459 --> 22:35.961
And I had, I started, I had a equine practice in the mornings.

22:36.502 --> 22:41.391
I started at six in the morning until

22:41.371 --> 22:50.581
7.30 and then I was, of course I was, went in with a Dr. Cobbin, another practitioner.

22:50.601 --> 23:00.312
And then I came to the office at 7.30 and took in clients for small ammo.

23:01.473 --> 23:03.896
And then did surgery during lunch hour.

23:05.117 --> 23:09.842
And then went back on some large ammo calls in the afternoon.

23:09.822 --> 23:18.753
And then got back by 4 o'clock to take care of the small animals, customers from clients from 4 to 6.

23:20.275 --> 23:24.340
And then I went out and did dairy practice after 6 in the evening.

23:25.622 --> 23:32.050
And the brucellosis program had just started, and so we had to bleed all the dairy cattle in them.

23:32.030 --> 23:41.606
Then I brought the blood samples back to the clinic, and we were the designated clinic for running the brucellosis test, plate test.

23:42.828 --> 23:52.485
And I plated samples for all the veterinarians until about midnight, and then I went home.

23:53.258 --> 24:03.476
Now, did that veterinarian, did you turn to him, when you were still a student here, did you turn to him for advice or anything?

24:03.516 --> 24:04.117
Didn't know him.

24:04.438 --> 24:05.419
Didn't know him, okay.

24:06.361 --> 24:12.752
No, I went, when school was about,

24:12.732 --> 24:23.286
When I was about to finish school, I went back to Beaumont, my hometown, and Dr. Cobbman hired me, and so I went to work there.

24:24.768 --> 24:33.880
But in the interim, Dr. Burns had offered me a job to teach in the veterinary school.

24:35.547 --> 24:44.078
So I contemplated that and went into practice.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.323
And he contacted me again.

24:49.546 --> 24:55.153
And he said he just had to have someone teach physiology that next year.

24:55.213 --> 25:01.622
And so I told him I'd come back for nine months and teach

25:01.602 --> 25:05.165
and then go back into my practice.

25:05.185 --> 25:09.710
Ended up staying 35 years, I guess, something like that.

25:09.730 --> 25:10.010
All right.

25:11.091 --> 25:22.202
Back in those four years of that school, Armistead was the dean the whole time?

25:24.164 --> 25:24.784
No.

25:25.966 --> 25:27.407
Was he the dean when you graduated?

25:33.985 --> 25:39.675
What my question is going to be, did the school change in its nature during those four years?

25:40.297 --> 25:57.428
What I'm trying to think, I think that Armstead left and went to Michigan State about my junior year or something like that, and Al Price was probably dean of

25:57.408 --> 26:00.774
my last year, I think.

26:01.155 --> 26:01.816
I'm not sure.

26:04.821 --> 26:18.505
But no, the school was really became a professional school while Armstead was dean.

26:18.485 --> 26:26.383
He made it into a real medical healing arts program.

26:26.764 --> 26:37.168
What was there that made you and your contemporaries proud of being part of this professional program?

26:38.752 --> 26:40.495
Oh, I don't know.

26:40.515 --> 26:51.613
He took some pride in being able to get into the program, being able to make it through the program.

26:51.673 --> 26:54.297
The fact that it was a small

26:54.277 --> 27:21.550
the only one in the state of Texas, small in numbers and a very difficult curriculum, and the graduates were recognized and compensated fairly well on graduation, I guess.

27:22.087 --> 27:27.543
It's something that you, if you like, medicine.

27:27.684 --> 27:35.708
I know physicians, when I went to work at Baylor College of Medicine,

27:37.780 --> 27:42.985
were just enamored by the fact of what veterinarians knew and what they could do.

27:43.025 --> 27:55.316
If you take human medicine, all you're concerned about is the anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, et cetera, of one species.

27:55.536 --> 28:07.787
And for veterinarians to know so much about so many different species and all different anatomical structures and different medicine

28:07.767 --> 28:16.359
drugs and pharmacology and diseases different for each one.

28:16.379 --> 28:18.341
It was quite amazing to them.

28:22.587 --> 28:33.522
As you look back now, what were the key courses, the most important courses in the curriculum for

28:34.008 --> 28:47.210
Oh, when you get down to it, it's well designed and it's step-by-step prerequisites, etc.

28:48.112 --> 28:52.980
I never cared for anatomy, but you did need to know anatomy.

28:53.020 --> 28:55.003
We took lots of anatomy.

28:54.983 --> 29:09.484
Physiology and pharmacology, which I ended up in, and pathology, which I minored in, in medical school, were probably the most important ones.

29:09.504 --> 29:20.620
You know, we do surgery and all of that, but when you come to treating disease, about 95% of it is

29:20.600 --> 29:22.183
is pharmacology.

29:22.263 --> 29:30.698
I mean, either inoculations or antibiotics or various drugs.

29:31.860 --> 29:41.537
So I think the physiology, pharmacology, and the pathology from the standpoint, you need to know what kills an animal, I guess, microbiology.

29:41.717 --> 29:45.223
All of that core are very important.

29:45.963 --> 30:00.867
As you look back now, were there any courses that were in hindsight kind of old-fashioned, and were there some that were really new and forward-looking?

30:03.513 --> 30:14.269
Well, medicine is medicine and had the same curriculum for hundreds of years, I guess, and it's pretty well thought that they all are necessary.

30:15.972 --> 30:31.495
Again, when it comes to really what's happened in medicine and what's going to happen, I would think that biochemistry and

30:31.475 --> 30:50.523
and immunology are the three areas that modern medicine is being built on, I would think.

30:51.925 --> 30:55.330
And was the vet school up to date on those then?

30:56.351 --> 30:59.676
Yeah.

31:02.103 --> 31:21.592
What has happened in the last 20 years in medicine or in biology in general and becoming molecular biology has been unbelievable compared to what we were taught.

31:23.455 --> 31:27.621
We were taught in histology that you had a cell and a cell membrane.
