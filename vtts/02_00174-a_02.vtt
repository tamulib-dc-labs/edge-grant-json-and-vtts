WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:26.393
they were pre-vet and their mother was a public 
school teacher in baytown apparently something

00:02.630 --> 00:26.393
of a legend down there and anyway that was my first 
experience with that terribly smelly

00:02.630 --> 00:26.393
environment

00:26.693 --> 00:34.204
And the other was to Houston just to see the big city 
with a couple of the Houston boys. What else did you

00:35.506 --> 00:40.593
and your buddies do then on a weekend here that 
summer? Walk the bullring. Oh. I did anyway. And

00:45.841 --> 00:51.309
what were your alleged shortcomings that led you 
to be on the bullring? Exercising freshman

00:51.730 --> 00:53.673
privileges. Oh, okay, such as? Well, to get away 
with whatever you could and not getting caught.

01:01.964 --> 01:19.509
Well, mine began with not polishing brass well 
enough or shining shoes well enough and just the

01:01.964 --> 01:19.509
military things. And I'd get a demurriate or two, 
and they built up a little bit along. And this was

01:25.756 --> 01:51.431
because the first,

01:25.756 --> 01:51.431
well, June and into mid-July, I'd say, it took that 
long for me just to know whether I was going to drown

01:25.756 --> 01:51.431
or not down here in this place with trying to get on 
top of chemistry and just do everything. And so...

01:55.034 --> 01:58.498
I was doing, I was making an effort anyway. I won't 
say I was doing my best, but I was making an effort to

01:59.119 --> 02:06.387
do the military things, but I came up short pretty 
often. And I accumulated quite a few demerits. And

02:12.614 --> 02:19.862
so I got to the point, I can't remember how many you 
were allowed before you had to start walking the

02:12.614 --> 02:19.862
bullring to get them off. But anyway, that 
happened along in mid-July. And as I got involved

02:24.751 --> 02:38.168
in that, then the pressures of the

02:24.751 --> 02:38.168
classroom began to subside a little bit. I began to 
see, well, I believe I'm going to be able to do this

02:38.188 --> 02:41.593
after all. Well, I began to join in. some of the 
activities of my fish buddies, you know, of trying

02:48.562 --> 02:58.131
to do whatever I could get away with. And then the 
demerits started accumulating a little faster.

03:06.620 --> 03:17.370
Give some examples of the pranks that y'all... 
Well, the ones that, you know, that I think, well,

03:18.633 --> 03:31.368
During my year, the first pranks that freshmen 
would do would be drowning out other students,

03:18.633 --> 03:31.368
either their fish buddies or upperclassmen. Of 
course, that was after you'd gotten your

03:31.388 --> 03:37.976
technique down a little bit where you'd get the 
upperclassmen. And so those were common things.

03:43.182 --> 03:47.627
And then doing things with firecrackers for 
upperclassmen.

03:53.036 --> 04:02.887
I wasn't involved in this, but it is an example of 
one of the pranks that I remember from that summer.

04:03.948 --> 04:17.142
We had one of the juniors, the second in command 
junior, was a guy with very poor vision. And he had

04:18.623 --> 04:24.955
visual limitations, vision limitations, I 
guess. And

04:26.438 --> 04:38.522
one of the freshmen turned

04:26.438 --> 04:38.522
a bottle of ink upside down on a piece of cardboard 
right in front of his door and pull that out then of

04:39.211 --> 05:07.463
course and he came up and picked it up and of course 
got ink all over him and we had to scrub of course we

04:39.211 --> 05:07.463
had to take the ink off that all everybody did but

04:39.211 --> 05:07.463
we had firecrackers with You could buy these, I 
don't know if it was Lindberger cheese, or it was a

05:07.915 --> 05:17.730
pretty aromatic cheese anyway, that you could buy 
in little sacks. And this was a pretty popular

05:18.912 --> 05:31.712
prank at the time to open

05:18.912 --> 05:31.712
one of those and put one of the big firecrackers in 
it. wrap it in plastic and put it in there and then

05:32.047 --> 05:41.076
light it and toss it down to the end of the hall where 
the CO or upperclassmen's rooms were. And then

05:41.156 --> 05:45.500
they'd blast all over their door and everything. 
And so you all did that in the summer? Yeah.

05:50.565 --> 05:57.131
As that summer goes on, how did you communicate 
with your family, your folks at home? Letters,

05:58.032 --> 05:59.173
phone calls? Just letters. About how often? Well, 
I think I started out maybe once or twice a week,

06:02.911 --> 06:10.622
probably. I remember getting fussed at by my 
mother when I went home after summer school was

06:12.444 --> 06:25.763
over that I needed to write more often. and how as 
you as summer school was over and you go home for

06:27.413 --> 06:56.307
three or four weeks how did you feel about summer 
school did you feel you'd made some progress

06:27.413 --> 06:56.307
well i felt at that point i felt pretty good about uh 
having passed everything and particularly the

06:27.413 --> 06:56.307
chemistry yeah uh that was it had been represented 
a big challenge to me and so I certainly felt much

06:56.894 --> 07:05.486
better about that. I

07:05.506 --> 07:25.112
felt that you know it was I was looking when I went 
home then I was looking forward to coming back in

07:05.506 --> 07:25.112
the fall and we had a lot of the guys that this had 
been a common item of discussion in August toward

07:26.088 --> 07:54.728
the end of summer of the summer school program of 
how much more we were going to know than the other

07:26.088 --> 07:54.728
freshmen that came in in the fall and how you know we 
could get them involved and get them in trouble

07:26.088 --> 07:54.728
doing you know give them these things to do not as 
orders but you know just telling them why don't you

07:26.088 --> 07:54.728
go do this or that so we were looking forward to 
doing that sort of thing and What did you do in that

07:54.995 --> 07:59.380
break at home between summer and fall? Did you work 
on the farm? No. See, at the end of the last class,

08:04.385 --> 08:16.799
the last crop that we made was the crop between my

08:04.385 --> 08:16.799
junior and senior year. Oh, okay. in high school 
because my dad, while

08:18.097 --> 08:35.968
I was a senior in high school, my dad took

08:18.097 --> 08:35.968
possession of one of his restaurants that was in 
Winters. He had provided the funding for a

08:36.829 --> 08:41.337
restaurant to be built there by someone he knew 
from Brownwood. And he felt he had to take it over.

08:50.462 --> 08:53.646
He didn't like the management that was going on 
with it. And this was just when Winters was

08:54.307 --> 08:57.992
beginning as an oil boom town. And he was certain 
that it was going to be a good location. So they

09:03.659 --> 09:04.621
moved down. I stayed with an uncle, lived with an 
uncle to finish my high school year. We were no

09:11.219 --> 09:13.302
longer associated with the farm. The farm had been 
leased out for that year to my uncle. So did you go

09:17.547 --> 09:21.733
back to the farm or back to town for that break? I 
spent that interim in Winters. So I don't remember

09:26.679 --> 09:28.221
anything. Did you work in the restaurant? I 
imagine I did a little bit. I just don't have any

09:32.968 --> 09:35.551
recall of. All right. Then that fall, when you come 
back, how did you get here? that fall, do you

09:41.662 --> 09:42.643
remember?

09:56.741 --> 09:58.283
I may have hitchhiked. And I'm assuming you had 
left your stuff in your footlocker. Yeah, here.

10:04.711 --> 10:09.137
And about how long did it take to hitchhike from 
Winters to it was amazingly it was an amazingly

10:09.522 --> 10:37.572
efficient means of transportation I marveled at 
it at the time and I still of course now I guess you

10:09.522 --> 10:37.572
never think of doing that but I've made I have made 
faster trips probably my fastest trip from here to

10:38.581 --> 10:48.998
Winters was by hitchhiking, because I got with an 
old boy one time, and golly, his car would go almost

10:38.581 --> 10:48.998
100, and that's the way we went. What route did you 
normally take? From Angelo to Waco?

10:56.670 --> 10:56.951
No. Well, sometimes with hitchhiking, you get a 
ride to Waco, and then go across to Gatesville and

10:58.614 --> 11:05.685
Goldwaite, and up to Brownwood, and then across to 
Winters.

11:15.628 --> 11:18.892
Did you ever get stranded hitchhiking? You know, 
left somewhere for two or three hours, or the whole

11:20.434 --> 11:23.678
night?

11:28.384 --> 11:29.586
I don't believe I ever did. And did you ever have a 
negative experience? No, I really didn't. I just

11:38.234 --> 11:40.497
assumed that there would be some of those. I had 
some really positive experiences with...

11:43.401 --> 11:44.322
Describe some of those. I was picked up by... in 
Hearn. I got a ride to Hearn, and then was picked up

11:49.930 --> 12:05.811
out of Hearn by a young man going to Temple, on his 
way to Temple, and he had a an uncle and his family

12:06.702 --> 12:19.567
that lived,

12:06.702 --> 12:19.567
trying to think of the name of the little town. It's 
about 12 miles this side of Temple, between Temple

12:19.587 --> 12:28.103
and Hearn.

12:30.074 --> 12:30.855
Not Marlin? No, it's a little tiny town. We'll 
think of it later. Anyway, this was a German

12:38.284 --> 12:50.098
farmer, and he had a young family, and so we stopped 
in there, and it was just about 1130 or around

12:38.284 --> 12:50.098
lunch. I'm thinking that probably that was why the 
driver wanted to stop. He was... I didn't know it at

12:58.542 --> 13:25.765
the time but he obviously was also a German ethnic 
German individual and so at about lunch time if you

12:58.542 --> 13:25.765
had family nearby well you'd stop and take lunch 
with them and they were very open with me and had me

12:58.542 --> 13:25.765
in to eat lunch too and I that was a quite an 
experience to me to see this german family and

13:26.504 --> 13:54.587
uh... very rather regimented uh... experience 
with all the children coming in very very well

13:26.504 --> 13:54.587
behaved a lot of you know just stair step down it 
seemed like there were five or six of them and uh...

13:26.504 --> 13:54.587
the father was very much in control overseeing the 
whole operation you know said grace in a very

13:26.504 --> 13:54.587
formal way and It made an impression on me such that 
I remembered it through the years. And in all of

13:59.701 --> 14:06.511
those hitchhiking efforts, you wore your 
uniform, you didn't use a sign. No, I had a bag with

14:06.551 --> 14:14.722
an A&M symbol or sticker on it. I kept that until we 
moved out here, and it had gotten so tattered. I

14:21.297 --> 14:23.801
regret throwing it away then. Now I regret it. Was 
it normal to put your thumb up? Mm-hmm.

14:30.952 --> 14:36.100
Okay, you come back then in the fall, and to what 
outfit were you assigned? Squadron 4. I was in

14:38.704 --> 14:40.507
Squadron 3 in the summer. And what was the nickname 
of Squadron 4? Didn't it have a slogan or a

14:44.072 --> 14:45.935
nickname? I don't remember it anymore. This was a 
freshman squadron, see. It was still a freshman,

14:51.952 --> 14:58.941
we were in a freshman, we had freshman squadrons at 
that time. Oh, I see. Why then? Well, that's just,

15:01.304 --> 15:04.268
that was the custom. See, they had had some, this 
was,

15:04.288 --> 15:15.542
this was the first or second year back from the 
annex. Mm-hmm. And so maybe I can't remember if

15:16.867 --> 15:24.157
this was the fall of 51. I believe that's the first. 
I think it was the first year back. And that was the

15:29.245 --> 15:34.773
reason that they tried that summer school thing 
was because they were coming back on campus. And

15:35.634 --> 15:37.977
maybe they had tried it out and had it. I'm thinking 
that they had summer school for freshmen. the last

15:46.212 --> 16:10.110
year they were out at uh and so where were we all 
quartered in the fall uh north north near sabisa

15:46.212 --> 16:10.110
uh-huh we were still over there in right in that 
group of dorms and at that time all of the see in the

15:46.212 --> 16:10.110
summer only two of the dorms two of the four you know 
13 there's 14 15 16 and 17 are the numbered dorms

16:10.360 --> 16:33.432
they also have names which they go by now and I don't 
know those but in the summer we used two of those

16:10.360 --> 16:33.432
dorms we occupied two of those dorms in the fall all 
four dorms were occupied along with Walton Hall in

16:34.238 --> 16:42.687
that month or so break between summer school and 
fall when your parents or anybody else asked you

16:34.238 --> 16:42.687
what A&M was like in the summer, what did you tell 
them? It was hot and it was

16:45.350 --> 16:53.840
really hard. I haven't really talked about the the 
uh... not physical hazing but the you know the

16:59.112 --> 17:20.918
mental hazing that occurred that summer that was 
really intense such as well the problem it's just a

16:59.112 --> 17:20.918
matter of uh... is the mind games that go on with 
introducing yourself as a freshman and then they

16:59.112 --> 17:20.918
ask you asking you questions and just harassment, 
you know, mental harassment, which was really, I

17:21.050 --> 17:32.127
don't think, hurt any of us and was really quite 
useful. I mean, I think I grew out of the total

17:32.748 --> 17:48.492
thing, but I'll

17:32.748 --> 17:48.492
never forget the first

17:32.748 --> 17:48.492
day that the, all the upperclassmen were back here 
and we went to this was the second morning that we

17:49.079 --> 18:18.057
fell out to go to breakfast and we marched in and 
when we came out of Sabisa to go back to dorm 14 which

17:49.079 --> 18:18.057
was just on the other side of the hospital at that 
time there was just a sea of civilian garbed

18:18.408 --> 18:47.706
boys men whatever students out there and see they 
didn't have to wear a uniform but they expected you

18:18.408 --> 18:47.706
to know who was a junior and who was a sophomore and 
who was a senior and so if you would go to one and you

18:18.408 --> 18:47.706
whip out and there was a senior standing next to him 
and this was a sophomore well he would just let you

18:18.408 --> 18:47.706
have it for whipping out to him and not meeting that 
sophomore that senior first So at about 11.30, I

18:48.597 --> 19:04.596
had made maybe, well, I'd gotten across the street 
and was maybe 10 or 15 feet down in the direction

18:48.597 --> 19:04.596
toward my dorm. And they finally, they broke it up. 
I don't remember who all was involved, but they

19:10.503 --> 19:16.731
wanted to get us back to our room in time so we could 
fall out for for chow at lunch and it you know I was

19:18.466 --> 19:35.347
just I was just jelly practically because boy I had 
been you know yelled out and screamed at and it just

19:18.466 --> 19:35.347
went on all summer that way then. Now uh in the fall 
the outfit you were in was not yet a veterinary a

19:36.108 --> 19:44.558
pre-vet no uh-uh was there any cohesion to it at 
all? To the unit? Was there any particular

19:46.947 --> 19:50.150
similarity of major? No. These were pretty large, 
numerically large outfits. They divided the,

19:59.200 --> 20:07.950
there'd be more students in a freshman outfit, or 
there was that year. And practically all of them

20:09.712 --> 20:12.395
were freshmen. I mean, there was just a small 
number. And you summer freshmen were unusual

20:14.845 --> 20:24.317
compared, because the majority were, that was 
their first day. Uh-huh. Was there a nickname for

20:24.497 --> 20:27.501
those of you who had been here in the summer? No.

20:32.808 --> 20:44.683
There, now there were

20:32.808 --> 20:44.683
some of them who,

20:32.808 --> 20:44.683
about, well I won't say many a fair number of the 
freshmen in that class accelerated and adopted

20:45.018 --> 21:12.848
the class of 54 and others stayed with I'd say the 
majority stayed with class 55 but there's

20:45.018 --> 21:12.848
probably a third of them third of the students the 
guy that I came down here with for from Winters for

20:45.018 --> 21:12.848
example he he was a aeronautical engineering. 
Well, it was aeronautical

21:14.490 --> 21:20.661
engineering, I guess. How did you register in the 
fall? Do you remember? I stood in line at SEBISA.

21:30.239 --> 21:36.490
And who advised you on what to take? Was there 
somebody who kind of reviewed it before you?

21:38.920 --> 21:55.179
General, this was in, you went, we went, those of us 
that were here in the summer, the last week or two of

21:38.920 --> 21:55.179
summer school, well, we had to go to the Aggieland 
Inn. Okay. And they had a general studies division

21:55.860 --> 22:00.485
there. And

22:00.525 --> 22:04.890
we had a... There were counselors there, and then 
there were counselors, what was that? There was a

22:10.821 --> 22:15.147
frame building where the chapel is now. And we had 
to go there, too. Some of us went over there for some

22:21.775 --> 22:24.399
things. And you took a full load. And at that point, 
as far as you knew, your plan was to go to vet school

22:28.364 --> 22:32.869
after two years? Yes. In the fall semester, that 
was very much what I planned to do. All right, so

22:41.094 --> 22:48.663
what was the, describe the routine then for the 
fall with football season coming on and taking a

22:41.094 --> 22:48.663
full load. What was the routine like for an aggie 
fish on a class day? Well,

22:54.350 --> 23:00.798
the, you mentioned the board. Now, my 
introduction to the board occurred on college

23:05.063 --> 23:33.467
night what was that well this was the this was the 
first Monday night of class and we went to the Grove

23:05.063 --> 23:33.467
the whole student body went to the Grove and we had 
the the football team was introduced and the head

23:05.063 --> 23:33.467
coach talked to spoke a few minutes but in in in the 
proper order of progression of things. You know, a

23:35.608 --> 23:38.311
lot of the administration spoke. Dr. Harrington, 
as I remember, he was the first one, or the main one,

23:40.353 --> 23:48.402
I guess he was president at that time. And

23:50.203 --> 24:03.437
we had a board session after the introduction, 
after that was over, out in the the grove of live oak

24:03.620 --> 24:07.745
trees. It is between Wellborn Road and

24:08.846 --> 24:18.437
then dorm 17, I guess. And who received the board? 
Who got hit with the board? Well, there were

24:23.684 --> 24:29.450
several of us that got a lick or two, just so that 
we'd understand how this. And there were juniors.

24:33.708 --> 24:34.629
juniors that did it. What was the board made of? It 
was a wood, but was it a baseball bat or a? No, it,

24:38.314 --> 24:44.622
well, no, it was, it wasn't, it wasn't made out of, 
that particular one wasn't. I've seen them that

24:45.063 --> 24:52.512
were, where they'd cut off the end a little bit and 
then plane it down very, very sharply. But this was

24:52.533 --> 24:54.315
a one by three or something like that? Is, yeah. And 
did, did you have to drop your pants or? No, just

24:59.962 --> 25:02.145
pull them tight, you know, you were, You're 
supposed to lean over and grab as much of the slack

25:02.598 --> 25:07.684
as you could and stand up straight. And that would 
diminish the possibility of heavy bruising. And

25:13.872 --> 25:18.978
what did the other guys, what kind of noise did they 
make after each lick? Did they yell or anything

25:20.099 --> 25:22.402
like that? No. Silent. Yeah. Wow. And did anyone 
ever get hit high or low? Someone would, you know,

25:29.250 --> 25:32.413
maybe it was something like that. Were there any 
high or low shots where somebody got to return the

25:32.753 --> 25:37.157
lick? No, not that evening. And we had,

25:38.919 --> 25:47.186
that happened, I wasn't involved. I mean, I wasn't 
present. That happened during my sophomore year.

25:52.091 --> 25:54.593
We had some hell-raising juniors in there. in the 
outfit I was in. Right, so in the fall routine,

25:57.173 --> 26:03.648
you're assigned to a room and the routine really 
gets going. Who was your fish oil lady and what was

26:03.928 --> 26:09.440
described the room and the routine that the two of 
you had? Well, we were crowded. There were too many

26:10.984 --> 26:13.830
freshmen. were the dormitory space, so I had two 
fish old ladies.

26:23.526 --> 26:37.810
Bo Smith and Jack Lee were my fish old ladies, and we 
had a single cot that had been wired to the top above

26:23.526 --> 26:37.810
the, double bunk beds, so we had three. Three high. 
How was it decided who slept in which of those?

26:46.867 --> 27:02.249
Well, it was up to us to decide,

26:46.867 --> 27:02.249
and Bo Smith was,

26:46.867 --> 27:02.249
well, he volunteered for the top one.

27:05.553 --> 27:08.117
He was, that's just a trait of his personality. 
He's very accommodating, always has been and

27:11.149 --> 27:14.376
still is. He was a pre-vet, as it turned out. We were 
not assigned together because of our major. And

27:22.953 --> 27:25.077
Jack Lee was an accounting major. And did y'all all 
become good friends? Yes, and still, we still

27:27.655 --> 27:32.361
communicate. And you had three desks, three study 
tables? Mm-hmm. So there wasn't much floor space.

27:38.649 --> 27:38.869
No.

27:42.433 --> 27:44.336
We had a footlocker under the table. Was there a 
radio in the room? Yeah. And Jack Lee had a- Hot

27:49.205 --> 27:54.352
plate? No, a turntable for a record player. Oh, 
okay. A little record player. And he had a lot of the

28:02.763 --> 28:07.509
little records, were those 33's or- 45's. 45's, 
yeah. And was it okay for a group of fish to play?

28:14.858 --> 28:16.020
Just at certain times. Oh, okay. okay which meant 
that we played it uh as often as possible at other

28:17.690 --> 28:40.356
times uh all right and since it was an all freshman 
freshman dormitory then our freshman outfit you

28:17.690 --> 28:40.356
all didn't have to go clean up well we did but not we 
weren't permanently assigned there were in the

28:17.690 --> 28:40.356
fall we did have uh You know, the CO never had to 
clean up his room. Wiley Briscoe was the CO.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.455
But this was something that the, Well, it was one of 
the freshmen, I guess, that was assigned to

28:53.988 --> 29:04.262
develop the roster and maintain the roster of 
cleanup. And

29:04.282 --> 29:16.760
as y'all went to Sabisa and then classes all day, 
academically, what was the routine for you that

29:04.282 --> 29:16.760
fall? Taking a heavy load, more chemistry? Yeah, 
and this was a

29:32.429 --> 29:35.652
This is when I really had problems. I started out in 
organic chemistry. And I think everything would

29:43.721 --> 29:54.993
have probably been all right if it

29:43.721 --> 29:54.993
had been a level playing field. But being one of the 
few freshmen in a course that was taken by

30:01.319 --> 30:30.010
sophomores and juniors especially a lot of 
sophomores in there it was uh there were a lot of

30:01.319 --> 30:30.010
other things on your mind other than why were you 
who advised you to take that because you'd already

30:01.319 --> 30:30.010
had inorganic in the summer yeah and uh

30:01.319 --> 30:30.010
that i i don't remember that i guess uh how i wound up 
in it but i did and it It was really unfortunate

30:30.462 --> 30:41.415
because I wound up dropping, basically dropping 
it, but it was a WL because I was just out of my

30:30.462 --> 30:41.415
element. Who did you turn to for advice?

30:49.024 --> 30:50.625
I can't remember the name of... This was in the... 
It was Austin Curley over at...

31:00.483 --> 31:26.625
no i don't i remember him but i don't remember i 
didn't have a contact with him at that time did did

31:00.483 --> 31:26.625
everything else go okay that fall yeah but um

31:00.483 --> 31:26.625
