WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:03.998
You had to have Texas history. At least two. Yeah, I 
think you had to have Texas history. You also had to

00:08.806 --> 00:10.048
have U.S. history. And so, I can't remember who 
taught me U.S. history. Did you have notes, Nance?

00:17.219 --> 00:18.401
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did have notes, Nance. The one I 
remember, I had an English professor that taught

00:21.847 --> 00:26.895
Shakespeare. And... He was very good. He sat on his 
desk and had a cigarette hanging out of his mouth,

00:31.270 --> 00:36.398
but he could tell he loved the subject. And, you 
know, I enjoyed that course. Remember his name?

00:41.727 --> 00:42.788
That doesn't ring a bell with me. No, it doesn't. He 
wasn't here very long. Then I had a Spanish

00:44.671 --> 00:48.277
professor, very, I thought he was very, very good. 
He's extremely unpopular with other students,

00:48.778 --> 00:55.448
so, his name was Statham, and you weren't to be here 
with him. He was let go the next year. But when you

00:57.672 --> 00:58.573
walked in there, have done your homework and 
learned your vocabulary because the first thing

00:59.819 --> 01:22.873
he gave you a pop quiz and that was good for me and uh 
and i learned spanish surprisingly i took a uh i

00:59.819 --> 01:22.873
took spanish and german the german wolf walk it do 
you remember him i didn't think him as being very

00:59.819 --> 01:22.873
good teacher georgia joe wilkett yeah and uh I 
mean, I didn't learn my German, even though I have a

01:23.140 --> 01:30.789
German background, as much as I did my Spanish, and 
I went on to another semester of Spanish. How large

01:31.470 --> 01:33.392
were the classes in those days? Except for the 
lectures, like in freshman chemistry and things

01:34.614 --> 01:45.667
like that, from, I would say, 25 to 60. One thing 
that, I'm being honest, one thing that really

01:46.488 --> 01:51.173
disenchanted me was my

02:01.598 --> 02:06.587
And the professor insulted my intelligence. He 
said, you will turn in a 30-page term paper or

02:07.609 --> 02:15.764
something like that two days before grades are due 
in.

02:19.511 --> 02:23.238
And there were 60 people in the class. You 
understand what I'm saying?

02:26.928 --> 02:33.577
I mean, no way he can read 60 times 30 pages in that 
period of time. So I, I mean, I did what it was

02:34.218 --> 02:36.501
deserved. I went to the library, went just to the 
library, got a, where it was by, you know, by topic,

02:37.242 --> 02:56.648
took out about 10 books or 20, 15 books, checked 
them out, took them back to my, the night before

02:37.242 --> 02:56.648
they were due, set it up in my little typewriter and 
typed out I would paraphrase what he was saying,

02:56.999 --> 03:00.485
make some transition. I'd just paraphrase 
exactly what he was saying, make some stupid

03:00.505 --> 03:12.225
transition over to the next section, type it, turn 
it in, got a B plus on it. I mean, it taught me these

03:12.245 --> 03:16.913
educators are full of bull. I had no respect for 
them. Hardly for people in education majors,

03:19.983 --> 03:22.987
hardly. I mean, if that was, and I spent the whole 
time talking about, should we have round

03:23.067 --> 03:31.898
classrooms, or should we have square classrooms, 
and oh, it was hogwash. You know, I mean, and it was,

03:31.918 --> 03:38.787
I mean, sorry, but I get on high horse when I talk 
about that. All right. When you came back, did you

03:39.027 --> 03:40.489
have a car? Yes. My mother and father had gone to 
Germany, and they left their 41 Plymouth with me.

03:47.377 --> 03:48.439
Made me very popular. I was very popular. My 
brother was back though. He was married and he was

03:51.029 --> 03:54.854
milking cows and trying to get through. He had a 
couple of children before he graduated and he kept

03:54.974 --> 04:03.206
the car during the week. My parents left it with me 
because he was not as compliant as I was. He was

04:12.219 --> 04:13.461
three years older than me. Very intelligent. He 
kept the car and then I got it on weekends. And I went

04:19.822 --> 04:24.727
to every basketball game. I went all over the 
state. I gave rides for the sports information

04:27.129 --> 04:34.397
director, coming back, going there. I filed on the 
AP wire for him. I was sports editor of the

04:36.939 --> 04:43.706
battalion by my senior year, my life semester 
here, coach sports editor of the battalion.

04:43.946 --> 04:46.849
Describe the battalion and being on the battalion 
staff. What was the battalion like in those days?

04:50.078 --> 05:00.794
was

04:50.078 --> 05:00.794
the Inner Sanctum editorial page, I'd say, was 
more liberal than A&M. The sports page was, I

05:01.996 --> 05:06.663
think, much more service. The sports page, if we 
ever took anything off the AP or UPI wire, we felt we

05:08.346 --> 05:16.879
were really being lazy and not doing our job. We 
felt that there was enough at A&M of interest of

05:17.247 --> 05:28.483
other students to communicate, and we wrote a lot 
of features. It was a weekly then? No, five days a

05:30.706 --> 05:32.469
week. I spent eight hours a day on that rascal. Who 
was the advisor director? Roland Bing. Great.

05:38.017 --> 05:38.858
Roland Bing. B-I-N-G? B-I-N-G. And he later 
became president of Victoria Junior College. And

05:44.872 --> 05:50.598
we were in Goodwin Hall, second floor. And he would 
take the battalion and punch it up on, there was a

05:51.639 --> 05:55.503
chalkboard. And he would circle it right out here 
and tell us what we'd done wrong after we'd written

05:55.643 --> 06:04.192
on it. And I had a ball, it was lovely, you know. And- 
Now you weren't planning to be a journalist. No.

06:10.539 --> 06:13.562
You were just doing it for- No, they ran an 
advertisement. I said it was easy for me. And then

06:16.696 --> 06:18.599
we'd go back and say, well, I got my nickname. I 
moved into this outfit with Country Higgins, a

06:18.959 --> 06:25.928
football player, Walter Norton Country Higgins. 
And I found my grades, I could keep up in decent

06:25.948 --> 06:33.958
grades without doing much studying or working. I 
spent a lot of time in the sack. He walked in one day

06:36.458 --> 06:40.222
and said, Sporty, you've spent so much time in SAC, 
I'm going to call you SAC. Well, he's the only one

06:41.523 --> 06:43.626
who did that. So then one day I would go over to the 
athletic fields. I'd watch the basketball team

06:48.611 --> 06:51.114
practice, football team practice. I'd even watch 
the track team practice. Can you imagine watching

06:53.737 --> 06:56.380
the track team practice? Running around, just 
running around and laughing. And so one day I read

06:59.103 --> 07:06.010
in the battalion they need sportswriters. Gee, 
I'd probably know more about what's going on in

07:07.070 --> 07:11.414
sports here than almost anybody on campus. I'd 
rather be out there and observe it. So I went on and

07:13.577 --> 07:14.738
volunteered. And one thing different then, I 
think, that the battalion could, we, number one,

07:16.199 --> 07:27.651
we did not think that we had to arrange the world to 
our mindset. We did not take ourselves too

07:27.711 --> 07:32.336
seriously. We had fun. And In the sports page, we 
would take one reporter and say, you're covering

07:37.073 --> 07:48.049
the freshman baseball team, you're covering the 
varsity baseball team, you're covering the

07:37.073 --> 07:48.049
freshman track team, varsity track team, and 
things like that. And we'd fight for space for

07:48.650 --> 07:50.813
those people. We wanted to give write-ups to Paul 
Lemming. I knew Paul. Oh, Paul Lemming's coming to

07:54.599 --> 07:55.921
A&M? Best hire on the nation, you know. And so we'd 
get things like that. Then we'd interview him when

08:01.930 --> 08:04.113
he got here and stuff like that. Paul says he's got a 
lot of things written by me. about him.

08:12.160 --> 08:16.544
Describe the coaches and the kind of people they 
were, the head coaches. Well, when it came, Norton

08:17.545 --> 08:21.149
was a coach.

08:23.892 --> 08:24.513
Homer Norton. Homer Norton was a coach, coached 
the national championship team, won 19 straight

08:24.553 --> 08:31.600
games, 39-40.

08:34.094 --> 08:38.179
My father said his handshake was like shaking 
hands with a dead fish. He did not like his

08:39.761 --> 08:42.765
handshake. But I think Homer Norton was extremely 
loyal to his players. He would do anything to help

08:49.073 --> 08:52.357
his players. He did not give any sports writing 
moves.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.684
He did not change with the times, though. Before he 
came in, he still wanted to run the single wing.

09:06.869 --> 09:10.374
Army, West Point, were playing with plastic 
helmets. He was still using helmets. SMU came in

09:13.038 --> 09:17.724
with low-cut shoes, and he was still playing 
high-top shoes. Maybe it was a financial

09:19.587 --> 09:27.878
situation, I don't know, but he didn't change with 
the times that

09:19.587 --> 09:27.878
way. He had Bill James. He had maybe five or six 
assistant coaches. There was no strength and

09:37.399 --> 09:39.821
conditioning coach as far as I know. There was a 
trainer, various ones. Marty Corot was a

09:43.805 --> 09:49.810
basketball coach and baseball coach, no 
assistants or even a job, doubled up. Kern Landy

09:50.531 --> 09:55.536
was a track coach, assisted voluntarily by Ray 
Putnam. He had been here when I was a fish. What kind

09:59.208 --> 10:00.810
of person was Colonel Andy? Somewhat, I guess, 
probably irascible, though I have very good

10:02.892 --> 10:19.710
memories of him, because when I was a lieutenant in 
Germany, I'd covered the truck team for him, with

10:02.892 --> 10:19.710
him, and Boyle and Bones came over there, and I met 
them at the Grand Hotel in Nuremberg, two

10:02.892 --> 10:19.710
different occasions. It made me feel real good, 
because they saw me and came up and threw their arms

10:20.471 --> 10:24.595
around

10:26.802 --> 10:33.111
And they hugged me, because I never asked them 
stupid questions. I observed, I didn't need to ask

10:33.612 --> 10:40.882
questions, I was there watching the practice, and 
they really seemed to appreciate it. So, Colonel

10:41.844 --> 10:53.400
Andy took me to, let me ride the train with the track 
team up to the Commerce Track meet in Arkansas,

10:41.844 --> 10:53.400
Fayetteville, Arkansas.

10:53.954 --> 11:01.927
Were those men positive influences on the lives of 
their athletes? I don't think so, yes. Yes. A good

11:05.532 --> 11:11.522
friend of mine, Ray Holbrook, a classmate, I would 
say yes. Did athletes go to class? Yes, yes, yes.

11:15.428 --> 11:18.713
Were there any giveaway courses or majors for 
athletes?

11:21.578 --> 11:23.320
would probably be the closest. They'd give seven a 
year, probably PE more. Some guys I knew had really

11:28.245 --> 11:31.508
high GPAs in PE. I'm not really qualified to answer 
that question. But there were a number of athletes

11:35.552 --> 11:39.116
that made splendid grades, weren't you? Oh, yeah. 
Oh, sure. Oh, and the strange thing was the guys you

11:40.177 --> 11:50.607
would think were the big linemen, you know, Odell 
Stolzenberger, Joe Turley, and Bob Gary,

11:50.705 --> 11:59.346
today would be 3.5 students. We had a three point 
grade point at that time, not a four point. So they

12:03.456 --> 12:08.528
were 2.5 or whatever, something like that. And 
when you reporters were doing your reporting, you

12:08.997 --> 12:15.626
wrote it on pads, and then you typed it up. There 
wasn't much electronics. Nothing electronic in

12:17.909 --> 12:19.211
that sense. We'd type it up, and I'd grind it out. 
And I could grind out a lot, and I wrote a lot. Did you

12:24.358 --> 12:28.003
go to the out-of-town games? Oh, yes. Did you 
travel with the team, save the basketball?

12:30.887 --> 12:32.890
Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn't. I would go for 
fun. That's when I went with...

12:39.625 --> 12:42.968
where Doug King was the sports information 
director. And he'd drive with me up to Dallas and

12:43.929 --> 12:47.932
see a basketball game. We'd drive back that night. 
And he was taken advantage of by the guy that the

12:50.875 --> 12:57.521
sports information director did not work for the 
athletic department. He worked for the

12:57.541 --> 13:01.044
information director of A&M. And Doug was 
expected, after he'd travel at night, he was

13:01.645 --> 13:08.991
expected to be in the office at 8 o'clock the next 
morning, which was totally unfair. Who was the

13:09.292 --> 13:10.554
guy's name? Somebody knows. But everybody says 
the same thing about him. He was a very unfair kind

13:13.778 --> 13:17.444
of guy to work for. But the sports information 
department did not work for the athletic

13:17.644 --> 13:21.349
director. It worked for the university. All 
right, now when you come back from the war in the

13:23.913 --> 13:32.666
fall of 46, the president of A&M at that point was 
who? Gilchrist. Gilchrist. Describe him from the

13:35.149 --> 13:38.995
student's point of view as president. Very 
suspect. Suspect of what? Not being in sympathy

13:44.273 --> 13:48.798
with the Aggie way of life. Okay. What? No, I say 
okay. Being a TCIP background. Did he? Not having a

13:55.366 --> 14:01.953
great admiration for his engineering ability 
because he supposedly designed Gilchrist Folly.

14:02.654 --> 14:03.715
Ever heard of Gilchrist Folly? The Road to Hearn.

14:09.299 --> 14:11.762
Apparently it's not railroad tracks. And you got 
there and then you made a 90 degree turn over an

14:11.782 --> 14:20.912
overpass over to the other side of the railroad 
track and made another 90 degree turn to go through

14:11.782 --> 14:20.912
Hearn. And that was known as Gilchrist Folly 
because he was the head of the Texas Highway

14:22.233 --> 14:27.939
Department and that was built. I doubt if he had 
anything to do with the design of that. But he got

14:31.303 --> 14:32.424
the blame for it. Describe as far as you can 
remember it the circumstances that led up to and

14:39.370 --> 14:43.134
the March on the President's House.

14:46.477 --> 14:46.577
Okay. It all began when the first thing that the 
cadets knew, as far as I know, and I, all my

14:46.597 --> 15:08.179
classmates were seniors at that time, Cadet 
Colonel Ed Brandt, Rick Cush, and the battalion

14:46.597 --> 15:08.179
came out with the headline, I still, New Code of 
Corps Enacted to Our Place. New Code of the Corps.

15:10.490 --> 15:24.426
Code of the Corps, which took away the authority of 
the senior court and instituted this new

15:10.490 --> 15:24.426
organization called the Student Senate. There 
had never been a Student Senate to that point.

15:30.694 --> 15:38.503
As far as I know, they did it without any laying the 
groundwork for the real reason that it really was

15:30.694 --> 15:38.503
necessary to do it.

15:41.707 --> 15:51.140
And I'll explain from my point of view, and I wasn't 
on the inner circle, but all of these veterans

15:41.707 --> 15:51.140
coming back, many of them not taking ROTC, not in 
any way, shape, or form. People who had been

15:52.102 --> 15:55.607
captains, majors, but had never had any college. 
Coming back as freshmen, they did not want to get in

15:56.768 --> 16:03.918
the Corps and go through fish year and all that 
stuff in the Corps. And there were no way for them to

16:05.541 --> 16:09.366
be represented within the student government. 
They were not part of the And therefore had no

16:11.474 --> 16:14.338
input. I think the Corps members would have been 
receptive to that if it had been explained that

16:15.619 --> 16:21.547
we've got to make some adjustments. But the 
administration, as far as I know, it just hit a

16:22.068 --> 16:31.079
bang, an accomplished thing. And there was a media 
hubbub gathering in the Corps. And I was living in

16:38.103 --> 16:50.042
that dormitory, kind of running over to the right 
there, and all of a sudden a talk show started

16:38.103 --> 16:50.042
talking about a march. They followed the Corps out 
just before midnight and marched over to that

16:50.903 --> 16:58.095
President's home by Savisa. And they walked up, 
some of them, not the cadet colonel and not Rick

16:59.257 --> 17:05.747
Hoech, not some of the higher strength people, and 
knocked on his door. He came to the door, in a

17:06.267 --> 17:13.975
bathrobe at least, maybe a night shirt, and they 
walked up and threw their senior rank at his feet.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.662
Then everybody dispersed and went back to their 
rooms.

17:23.005 --> 17:26.669
Ed Grant, Rick Hush, and a few others did not 
participate in that. So there was a senior class

17:28.391 --> 17:34.738
meeting, which I attended.

17:35.258 --> 17:42.629
They held a vote in the old British way, parting, 
standing, moving over and so on. And I am proud of

17:42.649 --> 17:43.731
this. I'll be very proud of this. They came to Rick 
Cush and they said that we've got to recommend to

17:45.413 --> 17:53.125
Rick that he resign his commission as the senior 
class's classmate. And I thought, that's Rick

17:54.727 --> 17:57.551
Cush's business, not their business. He doesn't 
want to do it, he doesn't want to do it. Everybody, I

17:59.314 --> 18:03.460
was the only one who voted against that. I mean, 
looking back, it took some guts of courage. I was

18:09.735 --> 18:11.036
all alone over there. Everybody else was over 
here. But I'm with individuals. I thought, hey,

18:14.820 --> 18:17.163
that's his individual right. He'll do it. He 
thinks he's right. And so I basically voted with

18:19.605 --> 18:22.128
the administration. But then a couple of days 
later, they had a knee that came out. You would go

18:26.813 --> 18:31.798
and talk to your senior branch advisor about how 
you voted. Now, that bothered me. That's a secret.

18:35.845 --> 18:39.570
It's none of their business to know how Bob Spode 
voted. I could have gotten in real good favor

18:39.590 --> 18:42.113
because I voted their way. So we voted, no, we will 
not go and talk to our senior branch advisor. Then

18:48.482 --> 18:52.907
on Friday afternoon, they changed that to about 4 
or 3, 3.30, 4 o'clock. You'll just go and talk. You

18:54.369 --> 18:55.511
don't have to tell them how you are. You just go and 
talk. Well, it's too late to have another senior

18:56.432 --> 18:58.915
class meeting. But we'd already voted. We 
wouldn't talk to them. So I didn't go and talk. And

19:03.582 --> 19:07.126
so I had to appear before a board with Colonel 
Malloy. And my senior transcripts of that board,

19:08.268 --> 19:13.174
there was one scared young guy up there. Yes, sir. 
No, sir. Yes, sir. Because my other dream had come

19:15.557 --> 19:20.123
true. I had two dreams. One, college I developed, 
get a PhD in history. I didn't think I'd ever do it,

19:23.187 --> 19:31.277
but I took the two languages just as a possibility 
in the future. Then one day I walked in ROTC and they

19:31.730 --> 19:38.839
said, and the other one was my childhood in a 
regular Army commission. And they walked in and

19:39.920 --> 19:50.594
said, now if you're in the top 50% of your class, top 
quarter of your ROTC class, the Army started this

19:39.920 --> 19:50.594
new program called Distinguished Military 
Student, Distinguished Military Graduate. And

19:50.614 --> 19:54.219
if you are in this, you can be a Distinguished 
Military Student. If you maintain it, you will be

19:54.239 --> 19:57.663
called a Distinguished Military Graduate. And at 
that time, the Army will tend

20:02.324 --> 20:04.526
It's like, here are your dreams. I mean, I had those 
qualities. You mean that's all there is to it?

20:12.455 --> 20:12.555
Yeah. So I went out and saw Colonel Olson right 
after that. And it just processed. But I was now in

20:16.920 --> 20:18.101
danger. I thought I might be in danger of losing 
that. But it's not complying with that order. And I

20:24.328 --> 20:26.710
got put on probation. That's all for the semester. 
And I behaved myself.

20:36.192 --> 20:40.196
The only interesting thing that happened all year 
was that later he was four-star general, of

20:36.192 --> 20:40.196
course. All right, now that march on the 
president's house, he didn't back down, did he?

20:46.701 --> 20:48.883
No, no, no, no, no, no. There was no change. They 
started, the new court of court was enacted. I

20:52.847 --> 20:55.089
mean, wasn't anything students could do about it. 
No, but I do think that they could have greased the

20:56.510 --> 21:02.496
skids a little bit better ahead of time, if you 
understand what I mean. I don't know, maybe they

21:02.516 --> 21:05.018
did with some of the cadet officers like McCush and 
Head Ranch. But if they did, they didn't

21:09.302 --> 21:12.667
communicate it down to the other people. Was there 
anyone for you during those years that you, any

21:12.687 --> 21:22.939
senior, any faculty or staff person you talked to 
that you got advice, counsel from? No, not really.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.866
Who told you to take two languages in case you got a 
PhD? I heard somewhere. I took German and Spanish.

21:34.077 --> 21:35.920
Looking backward, I should have taken French. It 
would have been a better one. But my father's

21:40.768 --> 21:49.142
mother, my grandmother, whom I love very dearly 
and who loved me, was very anti-French. She was a

21:49.162 --> 21:53.269
German coming out of Germany right after the 
Franco-Prussian War. And she endued me with a

21:53.329 --> 21:58.157
dislike for the French. very much so, and I did not 
want to take French because it was rough on them. I

22:03.719 --> 22:06.062
mean, I'm sorry, but that's the way it was. Now, 
among the other changes during these years, there

22:06.223 --> 22:15.095
were lots of student wives in and around the 
campus, weren't there? Yeah. And were there more

22:16.276 --> 22:19.180
of them employed on campus? I assume there were. I 
don't know. Were you here during the, did you go to

22:22.605 --> 22:26.470
summer, take summer classes? No, I never took 
summer classes. Okay. When I came back after, the

22:28.293 --> 22:32.937
first year I came back, I went to ROTC summer camp. 
My parents were in Germany. My home was with an aunt

22:36.761 --> 22:38.983
down in Beaumont. And so I kind of, she was kind of 
the home away from home. And I joined the Beaumont

22:44.548 --> 22:48.992
A&M Club, I mean the Beaumont Club here at A&M. I 
kind of was with it. And then the next summer, My

22:55.681 --> 23:04.172
aunt and I went to Germany on a freighter out of 
Galveston and went up to the, up the Baser River to

22:55.681 --> 23:04.172
Bremen where my father was stationed. Now, I'm 
getting away from A&M, but you might find it

23:05.494 --> 23:15.347
interesting, 1936 my father was a sharecropper in 
Texas. In 1946 he had a private railroad car. He had

23:21.533 --> 23:23.596
a sergeant to take care of the railroad car. He 
lived in the home of an affluent German banker. He

23:27.922 --> 23:29.525
was lord of all he surveyed. He commanded a 
battalion of railway security police over there.

23:34.031 --> 23:44.086
He could hook that railway car to any train, go 
anywhere in Germany, and go with my mother, with

23:34.031 --> 23:44.086
sleepers and the whole little... And I'm assuming 
that he spoke German? He spoke German. He spoke

23:46.120 --> 23:46.801
German. And his last name? He never spoke English. 
He never spoke a word of English until the first

23:48.544 --> 23:50.566
grade. And that last name didn't handicap him over 
there? No, no, no, no, no, no. My, my, my. We went to

23:57.797 --> 24:02.424
call on my grandfather's people who were left 
there. Most of them were killed in Russia, they

24:02.444 --> 24:04.126
said. One woman there had been an official 
photographer with the Nazi Party. She had

24:09.153 --> 24:14.201
pictures and gave us pictures of Hitler meeting 
with Mussolini at Bremer Pass and things like

24:09.153 --> 24:14.201
that. Very cold fish. and she was very much a part of 
the Nazi movement. Went out to my grandmother's

24:19.612 --> 24:38.520
place, she was definitely present, Fokker's Lair 
near Hammelburg, and of course they tried to call

24:19.612 --> 24:38.520
it up to my father who was in the Army of Occupation, 
and I went out there and visited with them too, and

24:19.612 --> 24:38.520
she was, when I say this, she was very, very, very 
definitely a peasant. Alright, then you come back

24:38.872 --> 24:44.001
for your senior year in the fall of 47? Fall of 48. 
Summer of 47, RMTC at Fort Hood, summer of 48 in

24:47.847 --> 24:52.936
Germany. Alright, now let's see, let's start 
making some comparisons. There wasn't a Reveille

24:59.547 --> 25:01.491
in those years. No, Reveille died about 43. And the 
Yales and the Yale leaders and all those

25:04.522 --> 25:10.331
traditions were about what you had remembered. 
What about Bonfire by 1948? Was it bigger? No.

25:18.904 --> 25:22.009
Yale practice was not yet midnight Yale practice. 
Only on away trips. Oh, okay. At midnight Yale

25:25.655 --> 25:28.599
practice, and there was a fight down in San 
Antonio. I don't know if you ever heard about this

25:28.620 --> 25:30.242
one or not. There was a riot in San Antonio because 
the city fathers of San Antonio refused to set a

25:30.931 --> 25:38.860
site for midnight yell practice in San Antonio. So 
the yell leaders got on the marquee of a hotel in San

25:38.881 --> 25:48.011
Antonio, and the Aggies gathered there and were 
blocking traffic down in downtown. And the police

25:48.792 --> 25:56.802
came, tried to break it up, and the Aggies pulled 
out their knives and sliced the tires of the police

25:48.792 --> 25:56.802
cars. And they called out the National Guard. And 
riot police, and they came into the triangular

25:59.669 --> 26:06.795
formation, which the Army teaches, fixed 
bayonets to disperse this crowd of Aggies. We were

26:07.576 --> 26:12.020
playing Texas Tech down at the Alamo Stadium 
there. And so that was, that was what they, so it did

26:12.220 --> 26:17.245
happen at the ideal practice. I was there and I saw 
that. I didn't, I wasn't right in the midst of the

26:18.926 --> 26:23.931
Aggie crowd, but I was watching it from a distance. 
Do you remember whether anybody got arrested or

26:24.351 --> 26:26.293
not? I don't remember. I don't remember. I came 
close to it because I became a little bit berserk

26:29.437 --> 26:40.093
later on as the National Guard approached me and my 
friends had to restrain me. Let's see. Of all the

26:42.918 --> 26:48.466
football games when you were an undergraduate, 
what was your favorite game? Which one do you

26:50.209 --> 26:52.773
remember that you enjoyed most? Was there a 
special one? It was a very enjoyable period. that

26:58.394 --> 27:00.016
we did not have very good teams.

27:07.907 --> 27:09.870
Undergraduate.

27:11.613 --> 27:18.723
I guess when we tied Texas in 1948, 14 to 14, Tom 
Landry was playing for Texas. Texas had a good

27:18.783 --> 27:19.984
team. We had not won a game. We were nothing and 
nine. and went over and tied them, and made it

27:24.382 --> 27:27.867
nothing in 9-1. And at the same time here, there was 
another upset. Navy tied Army when Army had a great

27:31.752 --> 27:34.436
team. And that was another kind of upset. And I 
thought it was kind of coincidental that the two,

27:37.300 --> 27:43.649
they were tied at the same year. During those 
years, what were the most prestigious positions

27:43.669 --> 27:51.861
of student leadership that an Aggie student could 
have? Could have? And how were they selected as far

27:54.200 --> 27:56.944
as you and your buddies knew? Was it a fair system? 
Yeah.

28:02.191 --> 28:03.974
I never heard anybody complain about it. The 
person who was selected usually deserved it. We

28:08.160 --> 28:08.641
thought. And y'all voted. I recognized it. I 
didn't know everything in the background and all

28:12.867 --> 28:16.051
the considerations. And was there a vote on Yale 
leaders? Yeah. And did anybody, was there even a

28:21.267 --> 28:24.772
president of the student body then? There

28:24.812 --> 28:32.683
were class presidents.

28:41.575 --> 28:46.042
Were you aware that there were any secret 
fraternities then? As far as I know, there were no

28:46.082 --> 28:49.406
secret fraternities. In fact, when we It was after 
the war that they permitted honorary

28:51.153 --> 28:55.879
fraternities. There was no Greek on campus. There 
weren't even honorary fraternities until after

28:59.544 --> 29:04.110
war. Does that correspond with what you know? 
Y'all weren't aware of the TTs and the stickers?

29:09.137 --> 29:09.558
Were they? Okay. No. They were very secretive. And 
they were...

29:19.790 --> 29:30.684
Guyon Hall was a place where everybody went for 
movies and other big, were there any famous

29:19.790 --> 29:30.684
visitors in those post-war years? Other than band 
leaders. Who? What were some of the great bands

29:33.087 --> 29:34.569
that came? Ballman Grove, Xavier Cougon, Spike 
Jonze,

29:44.680 --> 29:48.845
one of the names, Jimmy, Tommy Dorsey. I think 
Tommy Dorsey came. And the big dances were held in

29:50.987 --> 29:52.970
Sabisa? Sabisa Hall, lovely. And how did Aggies 
behave at those? How did they treat those young

29:57.475 --> 29:58.917
ladies? Well, I guess one of the incidents that 
occurred with me, I saw myself as, I loved Galahad,

30:00.879 --> 30:12.493
loved Storrs and King out there, and I read them as a 
kid, Book of Knowledge, and My idea, my hero in all

30:13.300 --> 30:16.905
fiction was Galahad. His strength was his team 
because his heart was pure. And I later learned

30:20.910 --> 30:25.355
that my heart couldn't be pure, but I thought it was 
a good goal. And I went to one dance over there, and I

30:26.316 --> 30:30.702
was stag. And I saw this sloppy, drunk Aggie 
dancing with this nice-looking girl. And I felt so

30:37.130 --> 30:42.717
sorry for her that he was just falling all over her 
and everything else. And this is a joke on me. I

30:46.307 --> 30:47.428
wonder what cut in on them. I told her I felt sorry 
for her, and I came to her house at night coming to

30:48.589 --> 30:53.234
her rescue. And she told me, why don't you mind

30:53.975 --> 31:00.322
your own business? You know, that's what life's 
disillusioning moments. But by and large, Aggies

31:05.067 --> 31:07.810
didn't overdrink it, though.
