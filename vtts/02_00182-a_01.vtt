WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:19.779
And we're sitting in the living room of the Rogers 
residence getting ready for me to interview John

00:02.275 --> 00:19.779
Rogers about his experiences here first as a 
student and then as a member of the professional

00:02.275 --> 00:19.779
staff and faculty. Now, John, would you say a 
sentence? We'll test your recorder. I came to A&M

00:25.767 --> 00:28.130
in 1936. Okay, now.

00:32.768 --> 00:40.382
I attended Rice from 1933 to 1936 and then 
transferred to A&M in the fall of 36. I

00:40.542 --> 00:55.249
came to A&M in 1936 and went to school for two years 
to complete my bachelor's degree in 1938.

00:59.262 --> 01:01.285
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay. Do

01:02.546 --> 01:08.734
I need to talk louder? No, just hold it up. John, to 
begin with, would you give a stranger who might

01:11.417 --> 01:23.372
listen to this or read it later a summary of where 
you grew up and get us to A&M? Your growing up and

01:24.093 --> 01:28.999
your Rice experience and what you majored in and 
then We'll move you up here. All right, Haskell,

01:31.365 --> 01:33.687
I'll be glad to do that. Just briefly, I was born in 
Arkansas. I want to be sure and get that on the

01:38.271 --> 01:41.755
record. My father was a Presbyterian minister, so 
we moved around quite a bit and lived in Oklahoma

01:41.775 --> 01:55.948
when I was real young and started to school and then 
moved to Houston, Texas when I was in about the

01:56.738 --> 01:59.862
third grade, I believe that was back in 1925. I went 
through regular school, on through high school,

02:00.803 --> 02:10.614
graduating from John Reagan High School in 1933. 
And I went on to school then at Rice, since as you

02:11.395 --> 02:26.712
know Rice University is located in Houston and is 
quite a good school, and certainly a motivating

02:11.395 --> 02:26.712
force in 1933. was the fact that nobody had any 
money. So I could go to Rice for not much more

02:29.436 --> 02:36.407
expense than I actually had in high school. At the 
time, Rice had no tuition, and you may recall that

02:37.448 --> 02:54.554
the founder, William Morris Rice, had 
established the institution as a means of helping

02:37.448 --> 02:54.554
students who were unable to afford college 
education otherwise. So one stipulation was that

02:57.151 --> 03:00.314
no tuition was to be charged.

03:02.156 --> 03:09.684
I attended Rice just taking an academic course, I 
believe that's what it was called in those days,

03:02.156 --> 03:09.684
for three years. You can well wonder how being 
raised in Houston, that was a big city even then

03:11.906 --> 03:25.200
comparatively, would be interested in 
agriculture, but I spent a lot of summers on the

03:25.636 --> 03:33.303
grandparents farm in Arkansas and always been 
associated with farms and agricultural life.

03:34.487 --> 03:37.738
Also, moving around a lot, I didn't have any one 
place as a base, at least to some extent, so I always

03:38.039 --> 03:49.034
felt Arkansas was sort of home, since my parents 
were both from there and all their forebears.

03:50.636 --> 04:01.971
Anyway, after spending the summer of, I believe it 
was 1936, on the farm in Arkansas, I decided, well,

03:50.636 --> 04:01.971
I'd go into agriculture. I was ready to start 
farming, as far as that goes, but my father was a

04:03.082 --> 04:19.774
factor at that time, and while he never did 
absolutely insist on something, he strongly

04:03.082 --> 04:19.774
encouraged it, plus the fact that he was paying the 
bills. So we came up to A&M evaluate the situation

04:25.205 --> 04:35.579
in the summer of 36, and sure enough, I started A&M 
then in the fall of 1936 as a transfer student from

04:25.205 --> 04:35.579
Rice. Describe that visit up here. What did you do? 
How did you get here? What did you do? Who showed you

04:41.767 --> 04:44.871
around? Well, again, let me remind you, this was 
1936, so that's 60-something years ago. Anyway,

04:52.622 --> 04:54.925
my father and I drove up here, And I don't believe 
either one of us had ever been to the A&M campus

04:55.647 --> 05:00.554
prior to that. And I recall looking around the 
campus and going to the administration building,

05:01.415 --> 05:17.316
which was the main building at that time, and where 
all the administrative offices and the

05:01.415 --> 05:17.316
registrar's office was located. And somehow we 
got an audience with the current registrar, E.J.

05:24.185 --> 05:25.367
Howell, whom I'm sure... you're familiar with and 
is well known in Aggieland and so forth. So we

05:31.786 --> 05:36.031
visited with him for, I don't know, a couple hours, 
I'd say. He was very considerate and I was

05:36.111 --> 05:48.165
surprised that a registrar at that time would be 
willing to spend a couple hours with some

05:36.111 --> 05:48.165
individual student just wanting to transfer to 
A&M. But I'd say he did a real good job of it.

05:54.085 --> 06:00.013
Everything seemed to work out well, so we decided 
on the way home that that's where I'd go. So that was

06:00.794 --> 06:07.563
probably up in August, late August then, so I came 
on up here in a couple of weeks. Did you walk around

06:07.583 --> 06:09.846
the campus, you and your dad? I don't recall 
walking, no, I don't believe so. We may have driven

06:12.991 --> 06:14.873
through it. Of course, there wasn't nearly as much 
on the campus, so to speak, as there is today, but I

06:20.680 --> 06:25.985
really don't have much recollection other than 
the conversation with the registrar. That made

06:26.045 --> 06:29.408
quite an impression on us, and we remembered that. 
So then you come back soon after that first visit to

06:30.048 --> 06:36.114
enroll. Describe that arrival and how you got 
located into a dormitory and so forth. Well, I

06:42.800 --> 06:50.687
guess the first statement I'd like to make, being a 
transfer student at A&M is a challenge. Well, let

06:51.292 --> 06:59.704
me talk about the enrollment first, since it 
involves one of the historical A&M faculty. I went

07:00.706 --> 07:14.245
through the registration line along with the 
other students and signed up for courses, various

07:00.706 --> 07:14.245
ones that the advisors counseled me I could take. 
And of course, fitting a schedule in is a real

07:14.285 --> 07:18.852
challenge, especially I'd already been to 
college three years, so I didn't want to spend the

07:19.675 --> 07:25.563
rest of my life taking undergraduate courses. So I 
wanted to get as much credit, one, as I could from

07:26.224 --> 07:33.433
the Rice courses, and also to enroll for as many 
courses per semester. So I had a schedule all

07:34.234 --> 07:41.043
figured out that finally totaled 23 hours. I 
believe that's correct. I really do. And it was a

07:44.648 --> 07:46.510
real challenge. to fit that many in that would 
apply on my degree. And I finally got this all done

07:50.988 --> 08:07.886
and went around to get the final approval from some 
of the authorities, and I happened to encounter

07:50.988 --> 08:07.886
Dean Bolton, whom everyone knew at the time, and of 
course since then, he later became president.

08:07.906 --> 08:12.731
Well, he's a fine old man, but I surely got 
aggravated with him that day. He looked at my... My

08:15.211 --> 08:27.993
schedule and transcript and so forth said well i'm 
sorry you're a transfer student here so we're not

08:15.211 --> 08:27.993
sure that you can meet the challenges of the nm 
academic. situation so we're going to have to

08:28.193 --> 08:31.178
reduce your hours. And I immediately bristled up 
at this. Gee, I made good grades at Rice. What are

08:37.553 --> 08:38.794
you talking about? It didn't seem to have much 
impact on him. Maybe negative. I'm not sure. But I

08:44.100 --> 08:47.443
remember the incident real well at the time. But he 
won out. He was in charge and I wasn't. And I think he

08:51.347 --> 08:58.094
cut the hours back to 18 and said, well, we'll see 
how you do this semester. Then we'll Let it go on

09:00.352 --> 09:07.583
from there, and I might add, I took 23 hours every 
other semester as an undergraduate at A&M. Now,

09:08.284 --> 09:11.468
your major at Rice was listed as what? Academic, 
just what you'd call liberal arts. I just took

09:14.513 --> 09:20.922
conventional courses, English, foreign 
language, a science course. Then up here, what was

09:22.244 --> 09:24.507
your major? Agronomy. Describe... for someone 
that might not have known Dean Bolton, describe

09:29.090 --> 09:37.941
him physically and his characteristics? Well, 
I'm sure you're familiar with his name, the

09:39.342 --> 09:47.392
student name given to him, Bear Tracks, and he was 
like that somewhat. He was a very bulky sort of

09:47.773 --> 09:53.600
fella, not real tall. I don't He was under six feet, 
I would think, but very broad and muscular,

09:54.352 --> 10:10.366
strout-looking individual and somewhat gruff in 
his speech, but I came to know him much better after

09:54.352 --> 10:10.366
the years following. In fact, we went to the same 
church for a while, and he's just a wonderful

10:10.486 --> 10:16.531
person. He was a stickler for rules, and whatever 
the book said, that was going to be it. Where did you

10:21.935 --> 10:23.717
live that first year? I lived in Law Hall. Is it 
still standing? I believe so. It seemed like they

10:31.893 --> 10:33.916
were going to tear some of those halls down. I'm not 
sure whether it is or not. Whether it survived or

10:36.180 --> 10:40.326
not, there was quite an opposition to tearing some 
of them down. What outfit was that? 2nd

10:41.948 --> 10:44.011
Headquarters Field Artillery. Do you have any 
idea how you got assigned to that unit? Yes. Before

10:50.561 --> 10:53.586
I came up to school here, say a couple weeks before 
I'd already decided to go here and I knew a number of

10:53.802 --> 11:20.399
friends from the John Reagan era lived in Houston 
Heights there who were in A&M so I counseled some of

10:53.802 --> 11:20.399
them and talked to them and there were a number of 
the local boys in that particular battery, the

10:53.802 --> 11:20.399
headquarters battery so I guess I just requested 
it and was able to get in. I think they would let you

11:20.459 --> 11:23.623
go where you wanted to as long as there was no reason 
to exclude you or if there was room in that

11:24.160 --> 11:29.627
particular outfit for you. Describe the life of a 
transfer in 1936. Confusing. And sometimes

11:38.899 --> 11:41.042
difficult. I'll do the best I can on that. The 
system at that, particularly at that time where it

11:45.528 --> 11:52.817
was all core and all masculine, there might have 
been a, I could probably count the quote, day

11:53.287 --> 11:55.510
students on my hand. There were students who lived 
in the project houses, but they were in the ROTC

11:55.570 --> 12:02.720
also. So it was for all practical purposes, 100% 
core members. A transfer doesn't have a home. You

12:15.898 --> 12:18.202
don't fit in anywhere. You're not a fish. And, you 
know, there's a certain camaraderie among the

12:20.962 --> 12:23.826
fish. They all suffer, and they all serve, and they 
commiserate with each other. Well, they didn't

12:29.753 --> 12:32.837
know exactly at the time where to put me. I'd say 
when I moved in the first day of school, I was placed

12:32.898 --> 12:49.399
in a room with two fish, and I was a fish at that time, 
I guess you'd say, and stayed there for years. I'd

12:50.392 --> 12:53.858
say a couple of months, quite a little while. And I 
don't know just how or why this came about. I guess

12:57.625 --> 13:09.345
the battery officers and some of the faculty 
decided that juniors, I was a classified junior at

12:57.625 --> 13:09.345
that time, should be a fish and living with fish, 
and I guess relegated would be a reasonable term to

13:09.832 --> 13:22.545
all the activities that the fish encountered at 
that time. So after about two months, they

13:23.386 --> 13:37.240
decided, well, I shouldn't be treated as a fish, 
but I wasn't quite an upperclassman either

13:23.386 --> 13:37.240
because I'd never gone through the fish ordeal, 
which is fair enough, I'd say. So I was put in a room

13:37.726 --> 13:50.257
with two juniors who probably weren't too 
thrilled about this since they were bona fide A&M

13:37.726 --> 13:50.257
juniors, whereas I was a transfer junior. They may 
have called me a junior fish at that time. I'm not

13:53.500 --> 13:56.563
sure just what I recall. I've heard that a transfer 
is sometimes called a frog. Were you called a frog?

14:02.949 --> 14:05.691
Never to my recollection, and my... definition of 
a frog was one who started at midterm at that time.

14:10.898 --> 14:16.745
That's the only particular

14:10.898 --> 14:16.745
term. Did you get any hazing, initiation like a 
freshman would? Yes. When I was living as a

14:24.494 --> 14:29.780
freshman, I adhered to all the freshman 
requirements. I had a room to clean up along with my

14:30.722 --> 14:35.307
roommates and of course we're and had to meet all 
the, say, freshman requirements. You couldn't go

14:39.612 --> 14:54.847
to bed before, I don't remember, 10 o'clock, 
10.30, and had to be in bed by 11, and had to be up at 6

14:39.612 --> 14:54.847
and get the rooms cleaned up, and all the other 
various things that freshmen did. Oh, I remember

14:54.867 --> 14:59.571
one incident where I certainly qualified as a 
freshman. Are you familiar with the... concept of

15:03.603 --> 15:05.105
airing out. At that time, I don't know how long it 
was carried on, but the fish were required to leave

15:07.007 --> 15:20.763
the dormitory about, I think, four or five in the 
morning. This was later in the year. I think it was

15:23.807 --> 15:29.053
in the spring, but it was still kind of chilly, and 
all of us were Run out of the dormitory with

15:29.759 --> 15:33.605
practically no clothes on. I think I had a pair of 
shorts, literally, was all I had. And we were

15:36.910 --> 15:47.245
driven down to, my recollection is Wellburn or 
Milliken, somewhere down the road there, and just

15:36.910 --> 15:47.245
dumped out unceremoniously on the highway. And 
that was kind of an experience to get your

15:47.663 --> 15:54.850
attention. But I was fortunate. I got out on the 
highway and thumbed a ride, and some trucker

15:57.853 --> 16:02.517
stopped. I guess he was considerate anyway. He 
wondered what anybody was doing out there without

16:05.520 --> 16:10.665
any clothes on that time of day and brought me back 
to A&M. When there was a paddle session... Did you

16:15.777 --> 16:21.028
get treated those first weeks like a freshman when 
the paddles were brought out? I was paddled a few

16:21.910 --> 16:28.904
times, but not to the extent the regular fish were. 
At that time, I was paddling all up and down the

16:29.546 --> 16:35.558
river. All the classes, seniors paddled juniors, 
juniors paddled sophomores, et cetera. So I think

16:41.979 --> 16:48.447
I got my share as a junior fish, so to speak, when I 
got up there. But I didn't get nearly the amount

16:48.507 --> 16:53.733
that the regular fish did. Do you have a 
recollection of what the cost was of that first

16:54.874 --> 17:02.203
year for you and your family? I think it's about $50 
a month for everything, but I have the figure $400,

17:03.297 --> 17:14.634
$450 for a year.

17:15.696 --> 17:20.403
Did you have any spending money, a kind of an 
allocation?

17:22.686 --> 17:25.170
No. I don't recall a whole lot. My parents were 
supporting me in school. I had worked, of course,

17:29.731 --> 17:46.033
before when I lived in Houston and had some money, 
but there wasn't a whole lot you could spend money

17:29.731 --> 17:46.033
on there unless you left town on the weekends, 
which I didn't do so much my first semester. I guess

17:46.514 --> 17:49.037
it's true of most Aggies. After you stay a while, 
you leave more and more frequently on the

17:49.157 --> 17:54.364
weekends. Academically, how did you find the 
rigor of the A&M academic program compared to the

17:54.800 --> 18:06.092
Rice program?

18:06.112 --> 18:13.899
Rice is a more rigorous academic school, and I 
don't mean that as a derogatory remark about the

18:06.112 --> 18:13.899
A&M. The courses varied quite a bit, and there'd be 
some courses that would be comparable to the Rice

18:15.041 --> 18:24.250
courses. If you'll permit me to tell you one story 
about, this relates to Rice, but it bears on. At

18:32.465 --> 18:38.173
Rice, I was taking academic courses, and you're 
required to take one science course each year.

18:40.957 --> 18:48.447
This doesn't speak too highly of me, but anyway, I 
got to my junior year, and I was looking for a

18:40.957 --> 18:48.447
science course that didn't have a lab. I wasn't to 
an average spending a full afternoon in a lab,

18:49.849 --> 18:53.494
so... I ended up signing up for a psychology 
course, since it's construed as a science. That

19:03.249 --> 19:05.171
may be debatable, but anyway. It was a big class, 
two or three hundred people in the lecture, and I

19:06.073 --> 19:15.465
believe the professor's name was Dr. Patty.

19:16.778 --> 19:22.724
just to show that Rice is not all top notch. He was 
not a good prof in all fairness. And I was not a good

19:26.467 --> 19:30.491
student either, I might add in that case. Anyway, 
this is my junior year, and at Rice they grade by

19:30.511 --> 19:37.378
one, two, three, or did them by one, two, three, 
four, five. And I had done reasonably well my first

19:38.098 --> 19:42.803
two years, but the junior year I was, doing better i 
guess i'd gotten accustomed to the situation some

19:43.272 --> 20:12.013
i was taking five courses at the time and they don't 
give you any grades still well they give you grades

19:43.272 --> 20:12.013
the end of the semester but the courses were all 
year courses you stayed them all year so my i got my

19:43.272 --> 20:12.013
report card at the mid mid year and it had four ones 
and a five in psychology I knew I hadn't done well.

20:14.775 --> 20:20.342
It was a lost cause as far as I was concerned, but I 
did want to pass the course. There was a rule at Rice

20:21.744 --> 20:28.794
then as a junior, you could only take five courses. 
If you failed one of your five courses, you had to

20:28.854 --> 20:34.542
drop one and only go back to four, the theory being 
that you weren't capable of keeping up with five,

20:35.534 --> 20:38.317
so you go back to four. So I went into the registrar 
and he looked at that report card and just shook his

20:38.397 --> 20:45.185
head and said, what's the matter with you? If you 
can make ones in other four courses, surely you can

20:45.205 --> 20:52.272
do better than a failing grade in psychology. I 
said, well, I really haven't done well. And I just

20:55.035 --> 20:59.220
wanted to be sure I didn't have to drop the course 
though. So he said, well, you go around to your

20:59.741 --> 21:03.685
psychology prof and talk to him about it see what he 
says so i went around to the prof now i'll never

21:04.475 --> 21:30.550
forget his expression that day he looked at the 
report card and then saw the five on there for

21:04.475 --> 21:30.550
psychology and then finally looked at happened to 
see my name rogers oh rogers i remember now i said

21:04.475 --> 21:30.550
you know what you did you took my core of my 
psychology course for a whole semester and when

21:04.475 --> 21:30.550
you wrote the name of the course on your term on your 
term exam you spelled it piscology and said i'm not

21:30.918 --> 21:57.010
going to pass anybody you can't even spell spell 
the name of the course after taking it a full full

21:30.918 --> 21:57.010
semester i got the biggest kick out of that but that 
was a that was a fact that no but see i had another

21:30.918 --> 21:57.010
semester you let me stay in there and i i finally 
ended up with a four but i I learned how to spell

21:56.990 --> 22:05.261
psychology out

21:56.990 --> 22:05.261
of it. Now, you were a junior. You took two 
undergraduate years here. Correct. But I took

22:12.851 --> 22:21.222
almost the equivalent of, I don't know, at least 
two and a half by taking excessive hours per

22:12.851 --> 22:21.222
semester. During those two years, who were some of 
the key faculty and staff members that you now

22:26.167 --> 22:34.908
remember proudly? Who were some of the good people 
that you encountered? During my two years of

22:38.817 --> 22:41.644
undergraduate work, uh... let me start in some 
sequence or i'll forget some and i think i can

22:42.468 --> 23:11.378
remember them pretty well while i was majoring in 
agronomy so uh... dr trotter was the head of the

22:42.468 --> 23:11.378
agronomy teaching department at that time and 
i've always held him in high regard i didn't take

22:42.468 --> 23:11.378
any courses under him but i had p trotter and uh... 
others in the agronomy department

23:11.847 --> 23:15.212
took courses under and were excellent 
professors. Dr. Luther Jones, I'm sure you've run

23:15.592 --> 23:21.381
into him in some of your discussions with other 
people. He was a soil professor there, although

23:22.022 --> 23:37.184
he's better known for lending money to students 
and faculty and anyone else who will borrow from

23:22.022 --> 23:37.184
him to obtain houses and go through school and so 
forth. Cotton Joe Mogford, if you're recall that

23:39.590 --> 23:47.604
name, was also in the department at that time, and 
he was the cotton expert, very fine gentleman.

23:49.908 --> 23:50.188
R.C. Potts, who later became dean of agriculture, 
I'm sure you know him, was one of the professors

23:50.268 --> 23:59.044
there, and he had just started. He was fairly young 
and come down from Oklahoma in him at the time. Did

24:03.792 --> 24:05.074
he have a nickname? I don't recall it if he did. I 
don't remember hearing about him. R.C. No, I

24:13.380 --> 24:19.206
believe that he was a grass expert, but I don't 
remember anyone giving him that nickname. Red

24:21.189 --> 24:22.650
Thompson was another. I don't know whether you've 
heard of him much or not. He later went on to Iowa

24:25.894 --> 24:35.365
State at Ames and became, I guess he was dean of 
agriculture up there in the administration.

24:36.577 --> 24:42.024
Those were the main professors in the agronomy 
department itself. I

24:43.486 --> 24:54.301
don't remember the names of a lot of the professors 
in some of the other areas. I do remember the

24:56.168 --> 25:01.922
chemistry professors, if you need to hear 
anything about them. Well, Dr. Hedges was head of

25:02.002 --> 25:13.671
the Department of Chemistry, and the student name 
for him was Steppenhalf, which I'm sure you've run

25:02.002 --> 25:13.671
into before. Kind of a thoughtless name for him 
since he was crippled and shuffled along like

25:14.360 --> 25:21.633
that. R.C.,

25:21.653 --> 25:33.095
I've forgotten his initials, Snuggs, I don't know 
whether you've run into him, encountered him as

25:21.653 --> 25:33.095
another of the chemistry profs. And perhaps the 
most colorful was Heddy and Jones. No? Well, gee, I

25:40.608 --> 25:43.973
thought everybody knew him. That was his student 
name, Head End Jones. I believe he was the one that

25:49.522 --> 25:53.589
lived on the campus and had all the roses there. No, 
maybe not. Anyway, he was an unusual character.

26:02.015 --> 26:06.552
quite volatile in the way he described things or 
discussed them. He mainly taught laboratory. I

26:08.861 --> 26:13.459
remember one incident where we were running some 
kind of experiment in the lab and You know,

26:14.182 --> 26:22.735
chemistry is a little uncertain a lot of the time, 
so all of us were asking him what to do and this,

26:14.182 --> 26:22.735
that, and the other in the laboratory. And some 
student, fortunately it wasn't me this time,

26:22.775 --> 26:31.508
asked him about what shall I do about this acid. He 
had a beaker full of it or something. He hit in and

26:33.671 --> 26:36.275
said, well, don't you know? I said, I'm sorry, I 
just don't know what to do. He said, well, go ahead,

26:38.759 --> 26:41.303
pour it in the pot. The container over there, smoke 
filled the room and everything. Now you'll know

26:48.796 --> 26:50.578
how to find out things. That would be typical of 
him. He'd be glad to tell you to do something to

26:52.922 --> 26:57.969
emphasize it. Anyway, I almost lived in the 
chemistry lab or department one semester. It

27:03.997 --> 27:08.824
seemed like I was making up hours in chemistry that 
I hadn't had previously. I had at least three

27:08.844 --> 27:11.728
courses over there, I know of. As you look back on 
your life, which of those undergraduate courses

27:12.215 --> 27:21.224
was the most important to you? I haven't come to 
that one yet, and I'll go ahead and mention it. My

27:26.529 --> 27:39.741
genetics course was, and the one professor to 
which I attribute having the most impact and

27:26.529 --> 27:39.741
actual effect on my life was Professor C.B. 
Godbey. I don't know whether you, well, he's a

27:42.338 --> 27:48.389
wonderful person and a marvelous teacher. And as 
an aside, I never have taken this on as a project,

27:48.549 --> 28:00.590
but like he's someone the university should 
really recognize for what he did during his career

27:48.549 --> 28:00.590
here. He was very mild-mannered, unassuming 
person. and didn't project himself but any of the

28:03.835 --> 28:26.417
agricultural students and particularly on into 
graduate school will just held him in the highest

28:03.835 --> 28:26.417
regard both personally and professionally 
anyway i happen to have him as my genetics

28:03.835 --> 28:26.417
professor and i enjoyed genetics

28:27.815 --> 28:30.959
and did reasonably well in it. And it was Mr. Godby 
who recommended me for an assistantship and to go

28:31.800 --> 28:43.313
on to graduate school and therefore enabled me to 
start a career after college. So I really am most in

28:43.373 --> 28:49.119
debt to him as one individual. And I'd say the 
people in the agronomy department, Potts,

28:49.960 --> 28:56.067
Trotter, Jones, and so forth, Was there anyone 
outside the faculty that you learned to turn to for

28:57.143 --> 29:03.994
advice? Was there anyone

29:05.696 --> 29:10.984
anywhere else? On the campus, for example? Well, 
yes, I would say M.L. Cashin was one that I talked

29:17.334 --> 29:20.820
to. Describe Mr. Cashin. Well, He was just a 
wonderful individual and I'll tell you how I came

29:27.788 --> 29:38.302
in contact with him initially and then I continued 
to visit with him during my years here. My father

29:39.023 --> 29:53.222
knew him or knew of him and they traced back to North 
Carolina relations and I guess they thought they

29:39.023 --> 29:53.222
might have even had some common relations anyway 
when My father was here on the campus a time too,

29:53.843 --> 29:58.534
very early when I was in school. He looked up Mr. 
Cashin and introduced me to him. So I always felt

30:04.869 --> 30:07.195
like I could go to him and did. talked to him at times 
and he was just just a great person thought so much

30:07.681 --> 30:25.546
of students and being in the center of the campus 
there at YMCA well I know he was a tremendously

30:07.681 --> 30:25.546
positive force for all A&M students. Physically 
if I I never did know him Would the two sons that you

30:31.525 --> 30:38.051
and I do know, are they similar in appearance to 
their father?

30:40.833 --> 30:48.280
I don't remember Mr. Cashin having red hair, but in 
fact, he didn't have much hair at all, as I recall

30:40.833 --> 30:48.280
him. Jim reminds me more of his father than Red 
does. I don't know. It would be interesting to see

30:56.688 --> 30:58.950
what they think, but... And it seems to me it has 
more of the characteristics of his father, just a

31:00.162 --> 31:16.379
real solid, wonderful individual, and always 
wanted to be helpful and to think of the other

31:00.162 --> 31:16.379
people. I believe Red probably is more forceful or 
outgoing, and I guess their careers probably

31:17.921 --> 31:29.713
illustrate this. And who was, during those 
student days, who was the president?
