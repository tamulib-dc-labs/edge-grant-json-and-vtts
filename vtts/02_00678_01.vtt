WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:08.147
the College of Education since 1977. OK,

00:08.167 --> 00:27.444
today is October the 21st, and I'm interviewing 
Dr. David Erlandson, who is the head of the

00:08.167 --> 00:27.444
Educational Administration Department at Texas 
A&M and has been with the College of Education

00:08.167 --> 00:27.444
since 1977. And what we're going to talk about, I 
guess, is the changes that have occurred since you

00:28.345 --> 00:36.012
have been at Texas A&M. how you think these changes 
have impacted the college, what do you feel maybe

00:36.262 --> 00:52.819
were the causes, and a little bit about what or how 
you think the college is achieving its mission of

00:36.262 --> 00:52.819
teaching research and service, whether it has 
changed from the previous administration to now.

00:52.919 --> 00:55.101
So just a general, just how you feel. Actually, I 
guess a lot of the things are in the archives, but

00:55.482 --> 01:00.367
people's perceptions and feelings are not. And 
that's what I'd like for you to share is certain

01:00.447 --> 01:05.492
things that maybe I wouldn't find in any of the 
documents. OK. And I'll take a few notes, too. OK.

01:11.236 --> 01:26.374
When I think back over the past 10 years, now, in 
many ways, when I first came here 10 years ago, it

01:11.236 --> 01:26.374
was, I guess, a little bit of a culture shock, 
because I come from New York City, Queens College,

01:11.236 --> 01:26.374
and the City University of New York. And it would 
have probably been hard to have chosen a place that

01:26.554 --> 01:35.665
was more opposite. from what Queens College was 
than Texas University, Texas A&M University.

01:43.387 --> 01:57.880
In fact, I can remember somebody asking me after 
I'd been here about

01:43.387 --> 01:57.880
two or three years, and I met a gentleman from 
Boston when I was down visiting interns in

01:43.387 --> 01:57.880
Houston. And he knew something about Queens 
College, and he knew something about Texas A&M. He

02:05.294 --> 02:10.542
was, as I recall, he consulted Texas Instruments 
and Computers. And he asked me what I thought, or he

02:11.163 --> 02:19.196
asked me how I would compare the two institutions. 
And I thought about it just a moment, and I said to

02:20.418 --> 02:26.508
him, well, I said, compare the two institutions. 
The best thing about Texas A&M is that there's no

02:28.310 --> 02:32.517
graffiti on the walls. I said the worst thing about 
Texas A&M is that there's no graffiti on the walls.

02:40.816 --> 02:41.036
Okay. Because I think one of the things that, you 
know, as I came from teaching in college ten years

02:41.056 --> 02:52.450
ago, I was certainly impressed by the 
cleanliness, almost the squeaky clean nature of

02:41.056 --> 02:52.450
the institution. I also was impressed by the, if 
you want, the Lack of fertility of thought, the

03:02.213 --> 03:11.603
almost stability in the thought of many people, 
students and faculty. In fact, I guess one of the

03:11.623 --> 03:31.545
other pieces of culture shock that I first noted 
when I first came in my first class, I noticed that

03:11.623 --> 03:31.545
when I began speaking, everybody was writing 
everything down that I said. And if I gave an

03:32.757 --> 03:38.366
assignment, there are no questions about the 
assignment. They just went ahead and did it to the

03:38.386 --> 03:41.130
best of their ability. It's quite a contrast from 
Queens College, where anything I said was

03:41.671 --> 03:47.680
challenged. Every assignment I gave was, is that 
really the best thing? And what's the educational

03:50.785 --> 03:53.589
intent of this? And that is very different. So what 
do you attribute that to? sterility of thought, as

04:01.445 --> 04:04.288
you put it, in the college? What do you think would 
cost that? Well, I think the traditions of

04:05.930 --> 04:24.793
engineering on the one hand, the dominance of 
engineering, where they prefer specific, clear

04:05.930 --> 04:24.793
answers in which they're trained in a way to come up 
with solutions and the best solution within

04:05.930 --> 04:24.793
relatively short periods of time. That, I think, 
possibly also the military tradition, where

04:29.558 --> 04:32.963
there is always somebody in charge and you take the 
orders from above. I think that was part of it. Even

04:36.247 --> 04:38.230
though this was an education? Even though this was 
an education, yes. I think it spilled over

04:39.812 --> 04:46.722
throughout the university.

04:46.943 --> 04:49.266
I'll get back to a couple of the reasons. Also, I 
think that it was true in education, but one of the

04:49.326 --> 04:57.878
differences I noted, for instance, between here 
and Queens also is If I give a written assignment at

04:58.297 --> 05:10.549
Queens, I may or may not get any assignments I ask 
for on time.

05:11.771 --> 05:15.495
Those that came in, some of them would be done 
sloppily. Some would be absolutely brilliant,

05:16.736 --> 05:21.361
perceptive, creative. Once I got at Texas A&M, 
tended all more to look alike. They were on to them.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.483
They were correct, often not extremely creative. 
Now, this is an assumption on my part to a great

05:33.824 --> 05:38.970
extent. I think that much of it goes to the 
institution, also to the clientele, the kind of

05:40.031 --> 05:52.164
student that it was drawing and what students were 
looking for in coming to Texas A&M. But I think also

05:53.085 --> 05:56.569
if you look at the administration, and the faculty 
that were there and had been there for many years,

05:57.578 --> 06:08.831
you got a similar kind of focus and emphasis.

06:11.454 --> 06:24.408
One of the things that I liked very much about Texas 
A&M after having been in New York is that they had a

06:11.454 --> 06:24.408
nicely streamlined administrative structure. 
There wasn't a lot of burgeoning, empty,

06:26.266 --> 06:32.873
deadening bureaucracy, in the worst sense of the 
word. Since I've been at Texas A&M, I've never felt

06:35.195 --> 06:44.724
that if I had a question about something or if I 
wanted to do something, I always could get a clear,

06:35.195 --> 06:44.724
definitive answer. That may be less true now than 
it was then, but I think we are getting something of

06:44.945 --> 06:52.392
a bureaucracy in the bad sense of the term. But it 
was very, the change of command, where you would go

06:53.148 --> 06:59.034
for answers, where you would go for approval was 
very clear. Quite a contrast to New York. You never

07:00.957 --> 07:02.218
know who to ask. You send up a formal request 
through channels and you never know what happened

07:02.819 --> 07:05.862
to it. You never know what decision maker at what 
level cut the thing off or if it just disappeared.

07:12.329 --> 07:14.011
It was very, very frustrating. Here was much 
better in that respect. Who recruited you,

07:18.175 --> 07:19.757
Brandon? Did you apply yourself or did somebody 
actually Oh, I think that if I had to name one

07:22.747 --> 07:28.433
person, it probably would be John Hoyle. I had 
known John for a number of years through mutual

07:29.474 --> 07:40.446
endeavors in the National Conference of 
Professors of Educational Administration. And I

07:41.627 --> 07:44.690
would say he was. He also played with me with Paul 
Henshaw Lane and with some of the others. Then my

07:53.577 --> 07:55.900
application, I took it from there. I was anxious to 
get out of City University of New York because they

07:55.920 --> 08:00.505
were facing bankruptcy. And in fact, they had just 
given us a furlough for a couple of weeks without

08:00.646 --> 08:12.220
pay in order to help solve a little bit of the 
problem. And it didn't look like it. It wasn't very

08:14.602 --> 08:15.824
encouraging. I was looking around, and this being 
a possibility, so I was very eager to take it. How

08:22.332 --> 08:25.715
long after you were here did you become department 
head? Seven years after I was here. I became

08:27.978 --> 08:30.020
department head in 1984. As I say, I think that some 
of the people who were here, like certainly Dean

08:31.461 --> 08:45.155
Huber in the College of Education, was very much 
nuts and bolts, no-nonsense administrator. He

08:45.195 --> 08:52.322
liked to keep his

08:45.195 --> 08:52.322
lines of control. very clean. He liked to keep them 
all in his own hands. We, at that time in 1977, we

08:58.096 --> 09:08.166
just had a new president who was a former Aggie, 
Jarvis Miller, who also projected the same kind of

08:58.096 --> 09:08.166
image. And I think at that time the institution was 
still fostering that. And things have changed

09:14.652 --> 09:19.677
gradually, I think, throughout the university. I 
mean, right now we have a very, very different kind

09:20.146 --> 09:35.885
of president

09:20.146 --> 09:35.885
who, you know, I think by nearly anyone's account 
probably is not a very efficient administrator.

09:36.426 --> 09:41.392
He comes across much more as the intellectual 
leader, as the stimulator. That's a vastly

09:42.373 --> 09:45.157
different kind of setting. I think there are some 
negatives to that. I think right now the

09:46.859 --> 09:49.562
bureaucracy probably is growing somewhat. It's 
hard to get the specific answer. It's hard to

09:52.229 --> 09:54.752
always determine exactly where decisions are 
made. Within, are you speaking about the college

09:55.272 --> 09:58.916
or the whole university? Within the university 
right now. Within the college, being a much

10:00.397 --> 10:06.744
smaller kind of an operation, that hasn't been 
true. Of course, we had our change in 1980 when Dean

10:07.885 --> 10:11.068
Corrigan came. And once again, a night and day 
change. A person who did not see all the lines of

10:14.732 --> 10:20.157
authority coming out of his own office. or tying 
back to his own office, no need for reporting every

10:20.491 --> 10:49.182
small detail, much more of a willingness to give 
responsibility to others, delegate to that

10:20.491 --> 10:49.182
responsibility, and allow others to pursue the 
mission as they saw it in the way that they saw it,

10:20.491 --> 10:49.182
and to build the college on that kind of a trust 
relationship.

10:52.165 --> 10:55.749
Couple of things as we parallel it with the 
university. One, being a member of a very small

10:57.330 --> 11:15.448
department, a relatively small department in 
contrast to the others in the College of

10:57.330 --> 11:15.448
Education, two of which are much larger, is that 
bureaucracy as such has always been less of a

10:57.330 --> 11:15.448
problem for us. And also, there's another piece, 
too. You never see the bureaucracy. when you're

11:22.777 --> 11:24.058
right in the middle of it. And one of the things that 
Dean Corrigan did early, sort of, if you want a new

11:24.959 --> 11:49.846
piece of bureaucracy introduced, was his 
steering committee for fostering educational

11:24.959 --> 11:49.846
inquiry, his own inquiry effort, which was sort of 
a loose kind of bureaucracy, but nevertheless was

11:24.959 --> 11:49.846
another kind of a structure sort of superimposed 
upon the operating structure of departments. Did

11:49.866 --> 11:51.788
you find a little resistance to that? Oh, yes. 
Yeah, there was a lot of resistance. Quiet, not

11:56.064 --> 12:03.634
loud, but there was a simple foot dragging, 
probably still is. I guess there probably still

12:03.654 --> 12:05.917
is, much less now. However, one of the reasons that 
I guess that I never felt the weight of that

12:06.398 --> 12:12.987
bureaucracy is because I was always part of that 
from the beginning. When you first put together

12:14.490 --> 12:21.960
the Steering Committee for Fostering 
Educational Inquiry, I was invited to be the EDAD

12:14.490 --> 12:21.960
representative on it, And then later I chaired 
that committee. So I never saw it. Now as

12:26.174 --> 12:32.183
department head, sitting on the policy 
committee, we're making the decisions. I'm not

12:33.545 --> 12:41.095
entirely aware of the bureaucracy as it's built up 
or as others may feel it. I think I've got a fairly

12:42.097 --> 12:47.084
good feel for how it operates in our department and 
how our professors feel it. And I say fairly good

12:47.104 --> 12:49.247
because it certainly is not perfect. But because 
we have a relatively small department, there are

12:50.122 --> 13:00.014
just 11 full-time members, I can get pretty good 
face-to-face feedback. In the two really large

13:00.835 --> 13:12.089
departments, curriculum instruction or C&I, I 
know that they've got, you know, assistant

13:00.835 --> 13:12.089
department and heads of programs and all that sort 
of thing. And I would think that you might find the

13:13.050 --> 13:18.897
responses there very different. Was there a real 
big shift when this came about from the mission of

13:20.922 --> 13:25.966
the college? Did it change very drastically from 
Hubert as far as emphasis on research? Because

13:31.471 --> 13:35.174
that seemed to be Corrigan's big thing as soon as he 
came in with his inquiry. And how was it in place

13:35.194 --> 13:38.517
before that? Well, yeah.

13:43.741 --> 13:49.086
In specific language, I don't think of what the 
mission was stated. or as it was supposed by the two

13:49.589 --> 13:58.702
deans, I think was probably less different than 
what it actually was in operation.

14:01.245 --> 14:13.302
Dean Hubert also believed

14:01.245 --> 14:13.302
in research and he worked hard to bring good 
researchers into the College of Education and

14:14.108 --> 14:20.916
once they got here to give them considerable 
resources so that they could do their work.

14:23.338 --> 14:30.767
The biggest difference there was that his 
definition of research was much more restricted.

14:30.787 --> 14:41.719
I think also his definition of service may have 
been somewhat more restricted. Having come up

14:42.560 --> 15:01.628
himself in the public schools of Texas and worked 
with TA, I think in terms of what he envisioned

14:42.560 --> 15:01.628
for ways that the university could interact with 
schools was pretty much a function of what he had

14:42.560 --> 15:01.628
experienced himself and the types of things.

15:05.554 --> 15:09.219
The state of differences weren't that different. 
The operational differences was. One other piece

15:12.260 --> 15:30.239
of operational difference is that when Dean Huber 
took over the College of Education, when General

15:12.260 --> 15:30.239
Rutter brought him here to Texas A&M, he was 
determined he was going to build the College of

15:12.260 --> 15:30.239
Education on hard state money. There are a lot of 
horror stories from around the country of

15:35.885 --> 15:42.813
colleges of education particularly, as well as 
other colleges, but colleges of education

15:35.885 --> 15:42.813
particularly that haven't built on soft money, 
there's grant money. And then when the grant money

15:43.775 --> 15:46.918
was gone, they collapsed. There was all sorts of 
acrimony. There was people losing their jobs, et

15:48.340 --> 15:49.762
cetera. And Frank Hubert saw, I think, that his job 
to build a college of education, to build a strong

15:50.863 --> 16:02.297
college of education, was to build it entirely on 
hard money.

16:03.560 --> 16:13.371
I think that was a wise decision, because I think if 
it had been done any other way, the College of

16:03.560 --> 16:13.371
Education would not have received the strong 
foundation that it did while he was here. How much

16:15.413 --> 16:17.876
is that true today? Is it still on hard money? Much 
less. Much less. We're still on much more hard

16:20.839 --> 16:29.348
money than most

16:20.839 --> 16:29.348
colleges of education and comparable 
universities are. We're bringing in, I believe,

16:30.290 --> 16:33.673
considerably more grant money. That's something 
you can check out. I couldn't actually quote you

16:34.854 --> 16:43.862
the figures, but I think we're doing considerably 
better, even though the funding sources have

16:34.854 --> 16:43.862
decreased. I see one of the things that Dean Healer 
would never want to have, he would never want one of

16:45.003 --> 16:54.732
his professors supported with grant money. He 
wanted them all to be paid with state funds. which

17:01.627 --> 17:17.401
has some powerful implications, because it means 
that, OK, you can go ahead and conduct this

17:01.627 --> 17:17.401
project, get this grant, do this research for this 
grant that you want to do, but you've still got to

17:01.627 --> 17:17.401
teach your class load, full class load, because 
that's what we're paying you for. The rest is sort

17:18.422 --> 17:20.063
of fun and games. And I think Oregon has seen the 
research, the inquiry, much more of a central

17:21.384 --> 17:31.633
focus than Dean here or Tim. Was there as much 
collaboration between departments as there is

17:32.221 --> 17:37.846
now, or is there more now? How does that stand in the 
two? That's a good question. I

17:43.151 --> 17:59.926
think there's probably more

17:43.151 --> 17:59.926
collaboration now than there was, to a great 
extent because of the inquiry structure that cuts

17:43.151 --> 17:59.926
across departments. And that was Gene Bergen's. 
expectation in other ways though i would

18:02.090 --> 18:28.992
hypothesize that there may be less there may be 
less now uh because uh when the college of edu

18:02.090 --> 18:28.992
college of education of course came out of the 
department of education and psychology and uh for

18:02.090 --> 18:28.992
a while during its maturation and growth College 
of Education was probably really little more than

18:30.119 --> 18:35.104
a large department. I mean, they were formal 
divisions now with department heads, et cetera.

18:38.527 --> 18:45.493
But some of the departments were, like ours, was 
really very, very small before we started adding

18:38.527 --> 18:45.493
members. I mean, just very small. And it means that 
the collegial relationships were necessarily

18:48.076 --> 18:55.162
developed with other people. And if you go back 
with, what, the old-timers, in the College of

18:58.942 --> 19:11.761
Education, particularly some of those who were 
around in the last days of the Department of

18:58.942 --> 19:11.761
Education and Psychology, they still have a lot of 
personal ties and a style of operation that harks

18:58.942 --> 19:11.761
back to that. And I think new members of the College 
of Education don't have that same type of thing.

19:19.753 --> 19:26.063
People when I came in 77,

19:19.753 --> 19:26.063
which was, you know, considerably after, a 
considerable time after the College of Education

19:26.448 --> 19:41.945
was formed, I still by necessity formed a lot of, 
got to know and began working with people in the

19:26.448 --> 19:41.945
other departments. Now, I'm not sure that that's 
true.

19:48.812 --> 19:54.598
The, I would say we have some departments, some of 
our professors who except for Maybe the formal

19:54.967 --> 20:06.263
requirements of some particular committee work, 
or maybe working jointly on a pro-seminar, or some

19:54.967 --> 20:06.263
specific assignment, have practically no 
contact at all outside of the department. That's

20:06.784 --> 20:11.291
probably even more true for the large 
departments.

20:13.294 --> 20:23.168
I'm concerned, for instance, with one of our new 
professors, with Yvonne Gonzalez in the

20:13.294 --> 20:23.168
Principal Center, that she doesn't have enough 
contact with all the people in the college,

20:23.890 --> 20:24.951
basically. There were other little things, too. 
It's just an aside, but I think it's a function of

20:28.935 --> 20:31.317
the same thing. Speaking for myself, and so I'm 
pointing to the finger of myself, I haven't been to

20:33.500 --> 20:44.010
a White Alta Kappa meeting in a local chapter in a 
long time. But I noticed in looking over our slate

20:45.571 --> 20:53.239
of officers for this year, I think there are two 
assistant professors from the college on there.

20:56.194 --> 20:57.496
Maybe two or three, but about that number. Most of 
the people are either graduate students or not

20:57.936 --> 21:03.905
related to the college. When I first came here, it 
was the Don Barkers and the Glenn Johnsons, John

21:04.827 --> 21:22.433
Hoyles, and the others, the key people in the 
College of Education, the key professors, who

21:04.827 --> 21:22.433
were also part of the capital larger picture It 
seems to be less of a concern. Well, for instance,

21:24.953 --> 21:31.341
last night, the local part of the chapter met, and 
Ken Kaepernick was speaking. I always enjoy

21:31.361 --> 21:32.763
hearing from Ken. He's always very candid. And I 
debated it for a while, and then just decided I

21:38.190 --> 21:46.641
needed time more for other kinds of things. Well, 
that's tragic in a way. I think we're in danger of

21:50.527 --> 21:54.912
losing something, a broader scope. I mean, the 
better things, of course, for me, have become

21:55.833 --> 22:02.841
things tied more directly to administration and 
what we're doing. In a sense, that's good, because

22:03.522 --> 22:06.065
we're doing some very exciting things. We're also 
losing that overall view. And that's unfortunate

22:09.569 --> 22:15.355
that that occurred. In your department 
specifically, do you feel that the department is

22:20.513 --> 22:44.614
much more to service than it is, of course, 
teaching is everybody, that's one of the primary

22:20.513 --> 22:44.614
goals, I guess, in every department, first and 
foremost, but there's some departments that are

22:20.513 --> 22:44.614
very, are leaning very much towards the research, 
and I guess psychology, educational psychology

22:20.513 --> 22:44.614
would be one that's heavy, heavy into the 
research, and is there a balance within

22:20.513 --> 22:44.614
departments as to, you know, because I would think 
that administration It would have to be more

22:45.944 --> 22:47.986
service, would it not? We're very, very heavy into 
service. In fact, I think if you look right now at

22:50.369 --> 22:59.621
our best research efforts, the research efforts 
are flowing out of the service. Now, that's not

22:59.721 --> 23:02.144
entirely a one-way street. I think some of the 
service efforts are also flowing out of the

23:03.085 --> 23:07.010
research we're doing. But I would say that

23:12.202 --> 23:18.655
the more powerful drive has to be coming out of the 
service and motivation. Part of that is because,

23:20.739 --> 23:33.906
well, we now have two quasi-independent centers 
within the community education center and the

23:20.739 --> 23:33.906
principal center. Both of them, of course, take 
their existence from the fact that they're

23:34.561 --> 23:39.145
service centers. And research is always in the 
support of service by definition of what they're

23:39.165 --> 23:43.550
doing. That's what causes it. We have some 
research isn't, for instance. I would say it's

23:51.137 --> 23:52.498
going the other way. Harold Hawkins' current work 
with his interface between learning and school

23:52.518 --> 24:01.767
plant, that study he's conducting, I would say 
it's primarily research driven. It has obvious

24:02.472 --> 24:08.438
service implications, but it's research good. 
What we're doing with the management profile,

24:08.778 --> 24:18.147
myself and John Hoyle, I'm not sure which is in the 
driver's seat on that. I think one shifted from one

24:18.227 --> 24:23.873
point to another, and that's maybe the balance 
between the two. Very good. Now, how do you think or

24:24.673 --> 24:31.500
feel that the university or the college is 
perceived by outsiders outside even A&M outside

24:31.683 --> 24:33.765
of the state. I know you do a lot of consulting, and 
you're visible in a lot of national

24:33.785 --> 24:40.931
organizations, and a lot of your people are. What 
is the general feeling as you travel around and

24:41.492 --> 24:45.255
participate in all this? How do they see our 
College of Education in relation to the others?

24:49.779 --> 24:52.982
Well, much, much better than they did 10 years ago. 
There's no question that we've risen in the esteem

24:54.344 --> 25:01.470
of observers from around the nation. I'm getting 
many more

25:01.754 --> 25:16.540
personal calls and direct inquiry about our 
students to fulfill professor's positions in

25:01.754 --> 25:16.540
other universities.

25:19.465 --> 25:25.095
In some areas, the service areas,

25:27.488 --> 25:33.134
I think that we really stand out for, even among 
those other institutions that are also service

25:27.488 --> 25:33.134
oriented. I think the things we're doing there are 
exemplary.

25:39.901 --> 25:55.437
The research,

25:39.901 --> 25:55.437
well I think if you looked at the, now this is, I'm 
speaking for educational administration, it's

25:39.901 --> 25:55.437
probably less true in educational psychology, 
but if you went back to the

25:55.771 --> 26:16.554
classical researchers in the last 30 years, the 
positivistic researchers that have dominated

25:55.771 --> 26:16.554
educational administrations as well as all of 
education, I would say they would look at what

25:55.771 --> 26:16.554
we're doing and think we're doing a pretty good 
job, but are not overly impressed by it. Yeah, I

26:18.857 --> 26:21.019
think that would be a fair estimate. uh they don't 
think we're doing any we don't look at some things

26:21.472 --> 26:49.015
that we've done and like them very well but other 
things that they're just not not super super

26:21.472 --> 26:49.015
impressed uh but on the other hand uh it's one of my 
doctoral students who had a final defense in uh

26:21.472 --> 26:49.015
august and will graduate in december uh picked up 
by lsu uh phyllis lot naturalistic research had

26:21.472 --> 26:49.015
been vacated by bill greenfield and we're perhaps 
and maybe the top name in that area

26:49.923 --> 26:58.375
in the educational administration. I think 
that's a... Okay, now we talked a little bit about

27:01.420 --> 27:05.225
the past and what's going on right now. My study 
will cover all three with just a little bit of

27:06.227 --> 27:10.212
looking towards the future. How do you feel from 
when you're sitting as head of your department

27:10.753 --> 27:17.483
that the college is going, say, not just the year 
2000, which everybody seems to be talking about

27:17.648 --> 27:21.954
right now, but even a little beyond that? I

27:21.974 --> 27:34.991
think one of the things that is going to have to 
happen, I have to say have to happen because, no,

27:21.974 --> 27:34.991
it's not going to have to happen. I can go either one 
or two ways. One of the things that ought to happen,

27:36.333 --> 27:46.086
I guess it's better to say, is that we need to become 
much more focused in our mission. One of the things

27:46.673 --> 28:08.719
I think that emerged with the new era that was 
actually given by Dean Corrigan was the feeling

27:46.673 --> 28:08.719
that we could do anything we wanted and we could do 
everything we wanted. The latter may be true,

28:10.001 --> 28:13.705
probably isn't, but it may be true. Excuse me, the 
former may be true. probably the latter

28:16.492 --> 28:20.077
definitely is not true. There's no way that we can 
do everything that we would like to do. We're tired

28:24.804 --> 28:30.112
just having done what we've done and we've wasted a 
lot of effort. I think we need to define what it is we

28:30.132 --> 28:34.117
do well and do that. I think part of what's occurred 
in the past has been that we've been trying to

28:34.839 --> 28:40.727
establish that name, that reputation. I think 
we've pretty well done that now. People know who we

28:43.504 --> 28:44.605
are. I think now is the time for us to refine and do 
things on a smaller scale extremely well. And I

28:51.053 --> 28:52.956
think that applies across the board. For 
instance, in teacher training, we're now

28:53.016 --> 29:03.148
preparing more teachers than any other 
institution, more science teachers. In Texas,

29:03.188 --> 29:07.153
more science teachers than any other institution 
in the nation. Maybe we need to cut back. Maybe

29:11.909 --> 29:15.132
since we can't do everything, we just ought to make 
the best of it. And we literally do the best. And I

29:16.794 --> 29:20.097
think in administration, that's true. Rather 
than trying to do new things, I think that we need

29:21.759 --> 29:26.404
now to focus, to refine. The same with the 
management profile. It's going places. Rather

29:31.469 --> 29:37.495
than doing anything new, we need to refine, make 
that better, learn how to improve on that. I'd say

29:38.403 --> 29:42.029
the same thing would be for all the things that 
we're trying to do. In every department or just

29:42.450 --> 29:44.273
your department? I'm saying for our department 
now, but I think that the same thing holds true

29:44.293 --> 29:49.122
across the college. Since the college is geared or 
is called, you know, the research, a research

29:50.504 --> 30:03.567
center or university or whatever, is there 
pressure on each college to focus on the research

29:50.504 --> 30:03.567
exclusively? There's not a lot of research here. 
There's not a lot of pressure here. I think

30:09.484 --> 30:21.054
research occurs, and we're conscious of it, and we 
want it to occur, but there isn't a lot of research.

30:21.174 --> 30:24.537
I think there is a pretty fair amount of research. 
There isn't a lot of pressure on research.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.803
There probably could be more research. Not all of 
our professors, either in our department or I'm

30:31.444 --> 30:35.207
sure across the college, are as productive 
research as they could be and ought to be. I know

30:39.941 --> 30:41.664
that that's true for our department. But 
nevertheless, we have some very, very good pieces

30:42.425 --> 30:46.310
of research coming up, excellent pieces. 
Professor research and doctoral dissertation

30:47.112 --> 30:50.016
research.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.422
But the pressure is not there.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.710
Just by way of contrast,
