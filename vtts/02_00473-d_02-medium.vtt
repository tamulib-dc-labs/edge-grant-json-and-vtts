WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:06.478
with the CIA, just like you cooperated with the Air 
Force Security Service. Yeah. The National

00:09.361 --> 00:24.499
Security Agency kind of gave direction to the Air 
Force Security Service so that everybody was

00:09.361 --> 00:24.499
doing something different rather than everybody 
trying to do the same thing.

00:27.683 --> 00:31.287
Well, what were you doing different here at the 
National Security Agency and what you were doing

00:31.587 --> 00:35.692
different from the Air Force Security Service? 
Well, the Air Force Security Service is gathering

00:36.994 --> 00:55.617
intelligence for frontline operation type of 
thing, whereas the National Security Agency is

00:36.994 --> 00:55.617
collecting information on a national level. I 
see.

01:01.928 --> 01:07.474
Air Force Security Service products, they went to 
the National Security Agency. Okay,

01:09.676 --> 01:20.647
now this is during a rather important time in 
American history.

01:21.087 --> 01:26.873
It was during McCarthyism

01:21.087 --> 01:26.873
and the anti-communist crusade that was going on 
in America. The FBI and the CIA, the powers of those

01:29.939 --> 01:35.584
two organizations were boosted. There were 
loyalty programs in the federal government.

01:41.690 --> 01:48.476
Senator McCarthy himself was making a number of 
charges against the loyalty of public officials.

01:49.036 --> 01:55.982
Did that have anything to do with your agencies, 
your jobs? I don't think so. No, I don't think so at

01:58.656 --> 02:00.138
all. That was,

02:02.722 --> 02:11.255
I would say that had no effect whatsoever. Okay. 
Why didn't, why weren't you assigned to Korea?

02:19.668 --> 02:24.535
Well, see I came back in 48 and And it just wasn't 
time for me to rotate again.

02:32.096 --> 02:33.117
See that was what, 52? 50 to 53. 50 to 53. See and I 
just got back from overseas in 48.

02:42.109 --> 02:45.293
And I just got command and security service in 50. 
And

02:47.617 --> 02:56.108
I guess the job I was doing there was more important 
than sending me over to be group commander or wing

02:57.067 --> 03:03.075
commander in Korea. Did you want to go to Korea? Did 
you want to go to combat? Well at that time I had a

03:06.240 --> 03:08.783
good job. While I was at the security service, I was 
up until 51.

03:21.401 --> 03:26.989
Then the one in Washington was really not a bad job, 
it was just just didn't, you had no decision. You

03:33.403 --> 03:34.685
didn't get to make decisions. No, I mean you really 
didn't, it was a coordinating type of job. And

03:42.215 --> 03:48.084
that's what my, that's not my

03:42.215 --> 03:48.084
cup of tea. Right. So why'd you go to an MBA program? 
Well, I had a lot of time on my hands. It was one of

03:58.863 --> 04:06.632
these programs that you

03:58.863 --> 04:06.632
work 40 hours a week. And I decided that if I was 
going to have this kind of job, maybe I would just

04:06.732 --> 04:19.185
get a master's degree and get out. Get out of the 
service? Yeah. At this time, you're thinking

04:22.369 --> 04:25.292
about resigning your commission? Well, you could 
retire at that time. So you were beyond your 40, 50,

04:27.644 --> 04:38.454
54. Oh, you could retire because you just were 
getting your 20 years in then. Yeah.

04:51.406 --> 04:52.967
So that's where they got into. took my master's 
degree, and I did this at night. It wasn't on the Air

04:57.985 --> 05:07.938
Force paid for

04:57.985 --> 05:07.938
part of the tuition and part of the books. It was a 
bootstrap program that they had. Oh, really? That

05:12.985 --> 05:14.026
sounds like a good program. Yeah, if you were 
willing to spend your time, the Air Force would pay

05:14.267 --> 05:24.220
for about half your expenses of going to school.

05:26.107 --> 05:35.756
So I got my master's degree in

05:26.107 --> 05:35.756
November of 54.

05:38.719 --> 05:40.221
And it was real interesting, actually. The 
courses I took were real fascinating, really. It

05:46.747 --> 05:47.888
was a two year program. Yeah, it was about a two year 
program. And most of the professors were in Well,

05:56.853 --> 06:17.058
like the

05:56.853 --> 06:17.058
Director of Civilian Personnel at the Naval

05:56.853 --> 06:17.058
Laboratories, which is an experimental station. 
He came in and he ran a course on personnel

06:17.098 --> 06:20.222
management. And then one of the high level 
controllers from the Pentagon, ran a controllers

06:24.275 --> 06:29.744
course.

06:34.030 --> 06:41.202
So we had real top level professors who actually 
were not day to day professors. They were people

06:42.644 --> 06:51.598
who were actually on a job, doing it on a day to day 
basis.

06:52.760 --> 07:01.310
the most boring ones were the professors who had 
written a book and he would read his book to you. Oh

07:01.731 --> 07:02.672
that's terrible. And so we complained to him and of 
course he completely turned it around and worked

07:03.513 --> 07:21.315
us to death on making special assignments to each 
one of us where we had to read some book and give a

07:21.734 --> 07:27.963
book review on it as to what it said, almost every 
week. When we complained to him about it, we wanted

07:28.463 --> 07:40.780
to get more out of it than just reading his book on 
industrial management.

07:42.302 --> 07:43.384
He really gave it to us. Well, it sounds like you 
weren't, after 18 years in the service, you

07:43.404 --> 07:51.555
weren't very happy with your job in Washington 
D.C. and you were thinking about alternatives at

07:52.852 --> 07:59.058
that time. Well, I figured that

08:01.501 --> 08:22.622
at that time I was looking for a promotion and I was 
looking for a job to get promoted and if you weren't

08:01.501 --> 08:22.622
going to promote me I just didn't want to hang 
around and be dead wood in the Air Force. And I see, I

08:23.665 --> 08:25.447
saw no future in that. So, I was really willing to 
try my hand at something else.

08:36.196 --> 08:36.977
And then what happened? What happened from 1953 to 
1955? You got your master's degree, but you ended

08:41.001 --> 08:47.366
your duty with the National Security Agency. 54, 
and then I went to the National War College in 54.

08:53.720 --> 08:57.525
Okay, let's talk about the National War College. 
How did that differ from the Air Force War College?

09:04.935 --> 09:22.258
Well, the National War College is a real high level 
college and this is where you get into political

09:04.935 --> 09:22.258
strengths of Russia and China. and you had people 
like Ball and to give you, oh yeah, you had really

09:23.251 --> 09:52.093
high level State Department people,

09:23.251 --> 09:52.093
Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, all

09:23.251 --> 09:52.093
these type of individuals were over there talking 
to you about

09:55.465 --> 10:04.481
and this is more of a

09:55.465 --> 10:04.481
geo, I said geo- International relations? 
International relations type of thing. And we

10:08.187 --> 10:18.165
took a trip and we went to London, England and was 
briefed by not only the State Department and the

10:18.905 --> 10:24.773
ambassador over there, but his counterpart would 
brief us. We went to Spain, we had the same thing. We

10:27.457 --> 10:29.260
went to Italy, had the same thing. We went to Libya, 
we had the same thing. We went to Vienna, and we had

10:32.184 --> 10:37.872
the same thing. And back to Paris, and you get 
briefings on the economic status of the of France,

10:49.499 --> 11:03.111
the political status of the state of France, the 
military status of France, and you had, it was

10:49.499 --> 11:03.111
quite an impressive course. And

11:03.351 --> 11:18.544
again, it was a seminar type of thing, and you had to 
prepare various papers on

11:22.253 --> 11:45.021
they would assign you some kind of a subject,

11:22.253 --> 11:45.021
or you could choose a subject, say, from 10 various 
items they'd give you, and then you would have to

11:22.253 --> 11:45.021
read up and prepare a master's type thesis on that 
particular subject. And

11:45.041 --> 11:51.349
like your critical metals, strategic metals type 
of sources and what happens if Russia takes over

11:51.970 --> 12:01.404
South Africa or why. What are you going to do? That 
type of situations. That sounds fascinating.

12:10.057 --> 12:15.585
Quite a change from the Air War College where it was 
much more toward personal management. This one

12:15.625 --> 12:19.311
seems much more toward international relations. 
World strategy. It prepares you, yeah, prepares

12:20.941 --> 12:37.984
you for I would

12:20.941 --> 12:37.984
say jobs on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and exchange 
student exchanges for in the State Department.

12:38.124 --> 12:48.758
And you had, well let's see, you had a high-level 
senior ambassador as one of the directors who

12:38.124 --> 12:48.758
worked permanently over there. And you had a 
commandant who was normally an Air Force or an Army

12:49.970 --> 13:01.624
or a Navy three-star general. And then you had a 
deputy from each of the other two services plus the

13:02.545 --> 13:08.652
State Department.

13:10.274 --> 13:11.455
And then you had about a third of the students or a 
fourth of the students were from the State

13:12.970 --> 13:20.781
Department, who were future ambassadors. No 
kidding. Oh yeah, so you had a lot of high level

13:21.642 --> 13:24.887
people there.

13:31.055 --> 13:33.739
Sounds like your students would be really 
stimulating too. Oh yeah, you know you had, no I

13:33.859 --> 13:40.108
enjoyed it, I enjoyed it.

13:44.493 --> 13:57.890
I see I was assigned to the, in 58 I was assigned to

13:44.493 --> 13:57.890
Ambassador MacArthur's, now he's nephew I think 
of Jim MacArthur. He was the ambassador to Japan

13:59.171 --> 14:08.483
and I was the Air Force, I was in the military 
assistance group. Air Force. That's a horrible

14:10.986 --> 14:12.087
job too. We'll get to that, but I want to stay here at 
the National War College. It sounds like a very

14:16.563 --> 14:19.507
stimulating assignment. Is this one year? One 
year now. I graduated what about June.

14:28.499 --> 14:30.241
Sounds like an elite job too. I mean an elite 
position. Sounds like they were, is it would it be

14:31.643 --> 14:38.892
true to say that people go to the National War 
College they're grooming for generalships?

14:39.693 --> 14:41.095
Yeah, in fact I don't know what percentage it is, 
but I would say probably 70% of the graduates of the

14:41.615 --> 14:50.948
National War College make general officer, flag 
officer.

14:52.130 --> 15:01.363
Well, if you select the cream of your crop to go 
there, well, it's natural that you should be in

14:52.130 --> 15:01.363
line for promotion. In the future. You were 
probably really delighted then when you got this

15:02.344 --> 15:06.350
assignment. Oh, yeah. Not only did you. not only to 
get away from the deputy directorship, but

15:07.518 --> 15:11.703
also... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Opens up a new 
assignment for

15:12.805 --> 15:18.532
you. And then, then from, no, I would say that that 
was, both Air War College is a very stimulating

15:18.552 --> 15:30.927
school, and the National War College, I would say, 
is very stimulating. In fact, I think any

15:30.947 --> 15:33.310
education is stimulating. Sure. If you are I think 
going and getting my master's degree was very

15:35.227 --> 15:38.472
stimulating. Do you think the fact that you went 
ahead on your own time and received that master's

15:38.492 --> 15:54.295
degree, do you think that had anything, and 
demonstrated to the Air Force that you had an

15:38.492 --> 15:54.295
interest in higher education, do you think that 
had anything to do with the fact that you were

15:38.492 --> 15:54.295
appointed to the National War College? No, 
because I didn't get my master's degree, I wasn't

15:54.315 --> 16:05.031
awarded my master's degree until November after I 
entered there in September. But still, you were

16:05.872 --> 16:08.695
going. I was going, but I don't know that anybody 
knew about it. Oh, I see. Although, see, you're

16:14.382 --> 16:17.326
just not a student. If you're going under 
bootstrap, all you do is sign the papers over at the

16:17.346 --> 16:27.157
university and they submit them to the Air Force 
for payment.

16:30.782 --> 16:34.326
It was after the National War College that you got 
your own command. 379th Wing in Homestead,

16:34.998 --> 16:39.324
Florida. Can you tell me about that? Well see, 
General LeMay was Commander Sack at the time.

16:46.193 --> 16:46.613
Right. And General LeMay was, I knew him from 
Hawaii. When I first was assigned to Hawaii as

16:52.501 --> 17:00.972
second lieutenant, he ran a navigation school 
over there, so as a first lieutenant, so My name was

17:01.998 --> 17:06.164
familiar to him and I guess he asked for me. Oh 
really? Well I don't know how I got his sign, but

17:07.727 --> 17:26.014
anyway I got his sign to Lake Charles, Louisiana 
and then I got 379th Bomb Wing because that 379th

17:07.727 --> 17:26.014
Bomb Wing was being activated at the time. Okay. 
These, what type of bombers? B-47s. B-47s? Yeah.

17:33.443 --> 17:39.971
And how many did you have, and tell me about the size 
of the unit, and your aim, your mission? Well, the

17:41.352 --> 17:52.626
79th had three squadrons of B-47s, then I had a 
squadron of KC-97s, who were tankers. And

17:56.825 --> 17:59.969
Actually, the command must have been about 1500 
people. And we moved down to Homestead and we

18:01.752 --> 18:09.903
opened up Homestead as an air base. So you opened up 
and built another one? Oh yeah, I mean that's...

18:15.350 --> 18:24.422
That's one of the, seems like that's one of the 
themes running throughout your entire career is

18:15.350 --> 18:24.422
that you're opening up and building bases. That's 
what my wife says every time I Every time I get it

18:27.048 --> 18:29.912
built up while somebody else takes over. Well that 
seems like the Air Force was quite happy with your

18:30.613 --> 18:34.338
job doing that. Well we did a pretty good job on 
379th and Brown Wing. I was real proud of 379th

18:37.181 --> 18:54.304
because

18:37.181 --> 18:54.304
we had a former cadre out of Lake Charles and then 
we, the few people that I had, we went up to Waco and

18:37.181 --> 18:54.304
selected all our pilots. for our B-47s to be 
trained. They were going through a flying school

18:57.704 --> 19:22.671
up at John Connolly Air Force Base at Waco and we had 
one accident during the entire activation period

18:57.704 --> 19:22.671
and that was right at the last where we had sent in a 
few fill a cruise that we didn't have a chance to

19:23.630 --> 19:29.477
select and then one of them had an accident. So we 
had it pretty well organized and it's I think the

19:31.099 --> 19:49.722
first time that we'd gone through an activation 
program of B-47s that we had had only one accident.

19:49.742 --> 19:52.185
In each quadrant of B-47s are there 15? Yeah, there 
was about 15 of these squads, so we had 45. Yeah, it

19:55.141 --> 19:57.063
was a pretty good outfit. You had about 45 B-47s and 
about 15 tankers? About 15, 18 tankers, yeah. And

20:04.671 --> 20:08.254
where were these B-47s? Here you are down in 
Florida. Where was your primary flight area? What

20:12.738 --> 20:14.900
did you take care of, the Caribbean? No, you were 
just prepared to move to a foreign base. And

20:22.355 --> 20:51.703
then from there you could, I don't know what the 
strategy was, whether or not you were outside the

20:22.355 --> 20:51.703
range of the Russian missiles, and that you take 
off from there and be refueled a couple of times,

20:22.355 --> 20:51.703
one in northern United States, one over 
Newfoundland, so that you could accomplish your

20:22.355 --> 20:51.703
mission.

20:53.489 --> 21:16.932
At that time I think the strategy was that you 
either move the wing forward to North Africa or

20:53.489 --> 21:16.932
some other, lowering the main, or

20:53.489 --> 21:16.932
just take off from there and be refueled.

21:18.582 --> 21:26.315
And after that, I think they changed the strategy 
so that you don't have a whole wing of airplanes on

21:18.582 --> 21:26.315
one base. They were going to scatter them around so 
you have one squadron at a base so that they're not

21:26.776 --> 21:36.011
so easily destroyed. But that was real, yeah, in 
fact I enjoyed that job too. I think that you would.

21:44.772 --> 21:49.118
How many pilots did you have then if you had 60 
planes under you? Well you probably had around 36

21:49.419 --> 22:14.155
pilots or 40 pilots per squadron and then you had oh 
let's say 30 in the air in the wing headquarters and

21:49.419 --> 22:14.155
see one of your programs was you'd deploy from 
Homestead over to over to to North Africa,

22:15.873 --> 22:21.278
just south of Gibraltar. And so we would get 
refueled over the Azores and refueled over

22:22.719 --> 22:35.952
Newfoundland

22:22.719 --> 22:35.952
and either back to the States, or if you're going 
that way you get refueled twice going.

22:38.754 --> 22:45.120
And that was just a test of your capability of 
deploying rapidly overseas.

22:46.771 --> 22:50.695
And I would imagine that you partook in a number of 
these missions. Oh yeah, yeah. In fact we were at

22:54.419 --> 23:05.952
one time coming back from one of those missions, I 
was hooked onto a tanker and it developed engine

22:54.419 --> 23:05.952
trouble in the Azores and it ditched. It did? And we 
went down and circled it until the RC Rescue got

23:06.613 --> 23:11.698
there. Has anybody hurt? No, I don't think anyone. 
Those tankers float real good and apparently the

23:16.876 --> 23:25.187
pilot did a real good job of setting it down in 
water.

23:29.433 --> 23:38.985
And then coming back, see we were on our way back and 
that put us about 45 minutes behind the flow of

23:29.433 --> 23:38.985
airplanes and so when we got over over New England, 
we were getting intercepted because we weren't on

23:39.860 --> 23:47.748
the flight plan, see, because we were behind 
schedule. And about an hour behind schedule, but

23:47.768 --> 23:54.394
we finally arrived back at Homestead without 
landing. And when we got to Newfoundland,

23:56.116 --> 24:08.348
of course all the tankers were just about headed 
home, so we were screaming for tankers for fuel.

24:09.087 --> 24:14.516
and some tanker commander said, where are you? We 
don't know where we are. They weren't in the

24:18.842 --> 24:21.426
holding pattern where they were supposed to be. 
They were on their way home. He said, I see a

24:22.488 --> 24:24.551
contrail. He said, make a nine degree turn to the 
left. We made a nine degree turn to the left. Then he

24:32.037 --> 24:42.011
directed us into him, we got fueled, and we did that 
at Harman in Newfoundland, and then we came on

24:32.037 --> 24:42.011
home. But it was exciting,

24:43.353 --> 24:48.340
I guess. I betcha, I betcha. You know, this is SAC in 
the 1950s was considered America's first line of

24:49.622 --> 24:56.792
offense. Oh, I tell you, SAC LeMay is a wonderful 
guy. I mean he is nothing, there's no commander

25:02.011 --> 25:11.780
like him, never like him. I mean he built SAC up 
until he was really a professional out there, but

25:11.800 --> 25:23.530
he was very very brutal as far as firing people is 
concerned. I mean you either were a lucky

25:23.550 --> 25:28.875
commander or if you were unlucky why you didn't 
want an unlucky commander around. I mean, maybe it

25:29.311 --> 25:36.343
wasn't your fault at all that you had a bunch of 
accidents, but he said, well, you're just

25:29.311 --> 25:36.343
unlucky. You're just tough. I mean, it's just too 
bad. And that's when I was... So he'd fire men

25:42.314 --> 25:43.977
because of that? Oh, yeah. Even if they didn't have 
anything to do with it? Well, he used to clean out

25:46.281 --> 25:54.475
the wing commander, the director of operations, 
the director of maintenance. He was just

25:55.231 --> 25:59.677
completely replaced with the top four people in 
the wing. Overnight. You have a couple of

26:03.963 --> 26:06.807
airplanes run together, lose a lot of people, why? 
He says, I can't afford it.

26:11.593 --> 26:13.035
So he kept everybody nervous. He kept everybody 
nervous. He came down, remember one time he came

26:15.218 --> 26:24.090
down to inspect the 379th, probably down there, 
and I showed him around and spent a couple hours

26:24.728 --> 26:39.286
showing him the wing and what we were doing and 
briefed him on flying time and pilot efficiency

26:24.728 --> 26:39.286
and all that type of thing. And then I took him up and 
delivered him to Arthur Godfrey. He was a very,

26:45.333 --> 26:48.658
very close friend of Arthur Godfrey's up in Miami. 
Oh, he was? Oh, yeah. And he was going out on a

26:50.520 --> 26:54.685
fishing trip with Arthur Godfrey And when I got 
back to base, my guy said, what happened? How did he

27:02.779 --> 27:03.439
like it? And I said, well, I don't know how he liked 
it. And I said, the only thing I know is I'm still his

27:05.262 --> 27:12.932
wing commander, because he introduced me to 
Arthur Godfrey as his wing commander. So I knew I

27:13.853 --> 27:15.295
still had a job. But was that tenuous? It was that 
tenuous, Curtis LeMay? Working with him? I mean,

27:23.838 --> 27:30.386
you didn't know from one minute to the next that you 
were still going to be a... No, well, it wasn't

27:23.838 --> 27:30.386
really, it really wasn't that. He just wasn't, he 
wasn't a guy that would brag on you. You know, he

27:37.734 --> 27:42.579
wouldn't say, well, boy, that's a good job, or you 
look like you're in good shape. He just expects it.

27:44.561 --> 27:46.644
Yeah, he just expected it. And I said the only thing 
he did was he just grunted now and then, but I said to

27:51.213 --> 27:57.321
him, after I got to Arthur Godfrey, he introduced 
me as wing commander, so I knew I still had a job. So I

27:57.621 --> 28:00.665
was kidding, I guess. What kind of man was LeMay? 
Did you get an opportunity to really find out what

28:02.447 --> 28:09.476
he was like besides off the job sort of? Well, I 
think LeMay is a workaholic. I think his job is his

28:13.642 --> 28:16.665
job. And Mrs. LeMay He was an individual who was 
very conscious of his people and taking care of his

28:21.993 --> 28:31.522
people. And he had a family, he organized the 
family services in Sac. It was second to none. That

28:39.069 --> 28:50.380
when an outfit went TDY, why the officers and wives 
who were left, who stayed at home would take care of

28:39.069 --> 28:50.380
the wives who were the pilots and the crews that 
were overseas, and they really took care of them. I

28:57.236 --> 29:01.720
mean, they would be sure that none of them had any 
problems. And when you reported in, you could go to

29:02.600 --> 29:15.672
Family Services and draw beds and sheets, and they 
had a fully equipped program. And when somebody

29:15.712 --> 29:20.316
got killed, in an aircraft accident why he wanted 
to be sure that that wife was taken care of. And she

29:27.315 --> 29:40.130
was given all the assistance and even after a year 
after that she still was looked after to be sure

29:27.315 --> 29:40.130
that the Air Force hadn't forgotten her. I mean, 
he's

29:40.590 --> 29:49.560
well, I was in the hospital out at Wilford Hall here 
about away six or eight months ago. I was his

29:52.750 --> 29:54.611
roommate. He was in the urology ward and I was over 
his eye. You mean he was here six or eight months

30:00.937 --> 30:03.259
ago? Yeah. Oh yeah. I thought he was out in 
California. Well he is in California but he was

30:05.921 --> 30:11.245
flown back here for operation. And you were his 
roommate? I was his roommate and

30:12.466 --> 30:20.053
he had had his operation about three or four days 
before mine. So he's always bringing me water.

30:22.924 --> 30:23.144
Really? Yeah. I mean, he's that type of guy. And he 
would tell the doctor, he says, now, he says, Doc,

30:28.109 --> 30:32.793
blah, blah, this is a friend of mine now. This is Tex 
Adler. I want you to take care of him. When he left. I

30:36.476 --> 30:38.778
mean, he's that type of an individual. But as far as 
professionalism is concerned, he expects you to

30:39.759 --> 30:46.785
be the best. And he certainly didn't expect you to 
slough off anything. He expects you to work 24

30:50.999 --> 30:59.748
hours a day if necessary to get the job done.

30:59.828 --> 31:04.193
It's just like in the navigation school in Hawaii. 
That's the first time I'd run into him. You have a

31:08.778 --> 31:12.682
navigation flight of 200 miles over water. Being a 
mile off wasn't good enough. He wants you to be

31:16.566 --> 31:19.369
right on the button. If you were happy.
