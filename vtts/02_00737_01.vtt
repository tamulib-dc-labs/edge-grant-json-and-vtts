WEBVTT

00:03.845 --> 00:28.722
have to make sure it's going first mr. Fowler like 
to have you tell us something about your early life

00:03.845 --> 00:28.722
including the the names of your parents the dates 
of their birth and death the places where they were

00:03.845 --> 00:28.722
born and the place where you were born and where you 
went to school before you went to A&M Well, my

00:29.140 --> 00:41.574
father was William Edward Fowler, and he was a 
physician and lived in Huntsville, where I was

00:29.140 --> 00:41.574
reared. And my mother was named Georgie Corbin 
McClanahan, and she was from a little town outside

00:43.016 --> 00:58.573
of Temple, Texas, Ohinoville.

00:58.874 --> 01:06.787
My mother died in 1911 and my father in 1936.

01:10.953 --> 01:25.236
And I, as I said, I was reared in Huntsville and went 
through the public schools and graduated from the

01:10.953 --> 01:25.236
Huntsville High School in 1916. And from 
Huntsville High School then the following fall

01:26.077 --> 01:29.901
you went directly to A&M? That's right. What was 
the procedure for getting into school at A&M at

01:31.283 --> 01:35.268
that point? I went over during the summer with some 
other boys and registered and Huntsville High

01:36.930 --> 01:53.569
School is a very small school and fortunately we 
had, we didn't have a bunch of electives and we had a

01:36.930 --> 01:53.569
necessary credits to get in. So you kind of 
pre-registered then before the school started?

02:01.592 --> 02:01.893
Yes. Were you at that point assigned to a military 
company? I don't remember that. I don't believe

02:08.502 --> 02:10.364
so. I think we chose that after we went back to 
school. Did you have some choice in the company

02:13.769 --> 02:17.775
that you went to? Yes. I had a friend who had been in 
B-2nd and I tried and did get into that company.

02:30.456 --> 02:32.640
You said you had some friends who went over there 
with you. Was it the acquaintance with people who

02:33.321 --> 02:41.555
had gone to A&M before that led you to go to school 
there?

02:47.205 --> 02:48.227
I don't know. A&M just always seemed the place to go 
for me. Well, you were very close to it in

02:52.210 --> 02:54.113
Huntsville. That's right. Of course, then that 
was a pretty tedious deal to get there. You had to

02:58.078 --> 03:06.930
travel on the plane, go down to Conroe and over to 
Hearn, I believe it was, and then back to college.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.993
Kind of almost all the way around Robbinsborn. You 
sure were. Let's see, Huntsville's only about 30

03:10.975 --> 03:13.198
miles away. No, no, it's about 80 or 90 miles. From 
college. From college. I was thinking Huntsville

03:21.046 --> 03:22.827
was closer than that. I think I'm correct about 
that, I'm not sure. But you had to go, actually when

03:26.171 --> 03:31.456
you were going to Conroe, you were going away from 
College Station, weren't you? Yes. And then over

03:32.137 --> 03:38.623
to Hearn, and then back down to College Station. 
What was your first reaction to the school and to

03:38.643 --> 03:45.670
the community of College Station when you arrived 
there? Oh, I liked it from the very first.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.383
Had you been to the campus prior to the time you went 
there to register? No. You hadn't gone there to any

03:57.645 --> 04:00.308
ball games or anything like that? No.

04:05.896 --> 04:15.488
Was there someone there to meet the train to sort of 
help you get from the train station to the college?

04:17.307 --> 04:18.949
Or did you have to find your own way? I don't 
remember.

04:22.332 --> 04:43.614
Could you describe a typical day while you were a 
student, including the things of what time you got

04:22.332 --> 04:43.614
up and how you were awakened and how many hours you 
spent in class and what other things you did in the

04:22.332 --> 04:43.614
day besides class and what was the procedure for 
going to bed? Well, they blew revelry of course on

04:44.475 --> 04:47.078
that. big law on that campus foghorn out there by 
the flagpole and then we had calisthenics drill

04:47.598 --> 05:12.458
and then went to breakfast and most of our theory 
classes were in the mornings and the labs were in

04:47.598 --> 05:12.458
the afternoons and then we had study hours at night 
with a sentinel walk in the halls, and I believe

05:13.855 --> 05:23.167
Capps was at 10 o'clock or something like that. Did 
you have the sentinel the whole four years you were

05:23.188 --> 05:28.114
there, or was there a change somewhere during the 
time? I believe they had that system the whole four

05:28.495 --> 05:31.919
years. Do you recall, you mentioned that the bugle 
was blown at the flagpole. Where was the flagpole

05:39.089 --> 05:41.332
located at that point? Same place it is. On the old 
military walk in front of the main building. In

05:47.848 --> 05:48.729
front of the main building. At one time, we have a 
picture of the campus that I'm not sure it's dated,

05:49.169 --> 05:55.336
but the flag pulled out in the middle of the drill 
field. No. That would make it a little further

05:57.759 --> 05:59.260
away. Do you remember the dormitories you lived 
in? Well, I was a freshman in Leggett Hall, and then

06:04.806 --> 06:12.735
I lived in Mitchell. across the Military Walk one 
year and the last two years I was in Goodwin. Those

06:21.082 --> 06:24.888
were all I believe fairly new dormitories at the 
time were they not? Yes. So they all had pretty good

06:27.452 --> 06:38.608
bathroom facilities in each of the buildings as 
opposed to something like Ross Hall which I

06:27.452 --> 06:38.608
believe had them only on one floor. I was surprised 
the main building was only about two years old when

06:42.618 --> 06:46.282
I went over there. And of course, I didn't realize 
that until much later. We just assumed it had been

06:50.907 --> 06:54.551
there always, you know. Yeah, I believe the 
original one burned about two years before, well,

06:54.571 --> 06:59.196
about four years before you came. Yeah, I think 
this one was completed in 14 or something like

06:59.216 --> 07:03.521
that. And you wouldn't believe the price. Well, I 
might. I've seen what some of the other buildings

07:09.390 --> 07:11.774
cost. Today it costs us a good bit more to go in and 
air condition some of those buildings that we

07:11.794 --> 07:18.586
built 50 years ago. It costs them more to air 
condition them than it did to build them.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.441
What was life like in those dormitories? Was it 
pretty quiet or did it get pretty rambunctious at

07:27.402 --> 07:31.710
times? Oh, we had some fun once in a while, but in 
general, it was pretty quiet. What sort of thing

07:37.089 --> 07:39.553
did you do for fun in the dormitory? Well, you might 
put a pan of water over a guy's door so when he opened

07:40.875 --> 07:48.486
the door, it'd fall on his head or something like 
that, about the extent of it. Did you ever dump

07:49.668 --> 07:51.611
water on him when he was in bed? No. No? Drowned him 
out?

07:58.589 --> 08:03.035
Did you have much to complain about the food? No. It 
was all pretty good? Yes.

08:09.303 --> 08:15.972
Was there much variety, or did you have pretty much 
the same thing each day of each week? I don't

08:15.992 --> 08:16.693
remember. Any particular meals that you 
remember? No. I have a couple people that

08:22.400 --> 08:26.065
mentioned that they had steak every Thursday. 
Mm-hmm. We did have steaks occasionally, but I

08:27.800 --> 08:34.189
don't remember just what days.

08:38.094 --> 08:45.884
Did the upperclassmen enjoy certain privileges 
that the freshmen did not have? Yes. What kinds of

08:47.406 --> 08:48.928
things could they do? Well, I remember it was very 
difficult for a freshman to get off the campus on

08:50.010 --> 08:55.377
the weekend. but the upperclassmen could go to 
Brian.

09:00.851 --> 09:03.354
Any other things that the upperclassmen could do?

09:08.621 --> 09:10.403
I don't remember anything particularly. We had to 
learn their names and speak to them and call them by

09:10.463 --> 09:14.748
name. Of course, there weren't so many of them. Did 
you have to call them by name each time you saw them?

09:19.955 --> 09:21.336
Yes, you're supposed to. Well, at a later date, I 
remember when I visited A&M campus When I was an

09:26.086 --> 09:38.382
undergraduate at Texas Lutheran,

09:26.086 --> 09:38.382
every stranger on campus was greeted by every 
Aggie he encountered, but I didn't remember

09:26.086 --> 09:38.382
hearing the Aggies greet each other by names. They 
used the same greeting for Aggies as they did for

09:39.283 --> 09:44.710
visitors, as I recall.

09:47.534 --> 09:52.380
What sorts of things did you have to do for the 
upperclassmen when you were a freshman?

09:58.587 --> 10:00.850
I don't recall anything particularly. I did a lot 
of work on the Longhorn and the battalion for some

10:00.870 --> 10:12.687
of the upperclassmen who were on the staffs.

10:15.050 --> 10:17.934
Would this have been primarily in the line of 
artwork? Yes. Well, I was wondering, some of the

10:20.638 --> 10:28.189
people have indicated they frequently had to run 
errands for some of the upperclassmen. would have

10:28.692 --> 10:38.343
to sometimes carry their clothes

10:28.692 --> 10:38.343
over to the laundry and things of that nature. No. 
You don't remember having to do much of that. Some

10:41.186 --> 10:46.152
people have said they made beds and things like 
that, shine shoes and cleaned rifles. No. You

10:48.595 --> 10:49.796
missed out on all those. Yeah.

10:53.060 --> 11:01.608
Was there any way that a visitor to the campus could 
visually distinguish between members of a

10:53.060 --> 11:01.608
particular class? In other words, was there 
something that identified a freshman or a

11:01.628 --> 11:07.253
sophomore or a junior or senior? Quite obviously, 
they had various military ranks. Other than that,

11:14.199 --> 11:16.101
I don't recall.

11:19.224 --> 11:20.725
You don't recall. OK. sorts of things did the 
students do for entertainment or recreation

11:21.207 --> 11:31.497
during the times when, say, they were not in class 
or if they couldn't go to Bryan for one reason or

11:21.207 --> 11:31.497
another? They had a picture show for the freshmen 
or any of the students every Saturday night in the

11:31.877 --> 11:38.124
old air dome. It was covered, but the sides were 
open. And they had a picture show over there every

11:42.548 --> 11:46.291
night, every Saturday night. Was this a free 
picture show? Yes. What sorts of movies did they

11:50.097 --> 11:52.160
run generally? Most anything that was available? 
I imagine so. Fairly current movies, or did

11:58.069 --> 12:05.220
they... Oh, we didn't know what was current. It was 
just something to do then. But primarily the

12:08.445 --> 12:16.797
freshmen would go to that because I think they were 
not allowed off campus after five or something

12:08.445 --> 12:16.797
like that on Saturdays. Could I tell you a little 
incident about that that was real funny?

12:20.896 --> 12:21.256
Certainly. Streaking on A&M campus back that far, 
would you believe that? We were painting the

12:28.465 --> 12:38.137
scenery for the senior class play in 20, and we got 
behind and had to work one Saturday night. And, of

12:38.877 --> 12:46.767
course, you have to let the freshmen go to the 
picture show, and a shower came up during the show,

12:38.877 --> 12:46.767
and I went over and cornered my crew and told them to 
get on down to the basement of Guyon Hall. And they

12:50.333 --> 12:51.534
said, well, it's raining. We don't have our 
raincoats. And I said, well, that's your problem,

12:53.997 --> 13:00.886
and went on down the military walk in my slicker. In 
a few minutes, across the corner of the drill

13:00.906 --> 13:05.772
field, there was a big flash of lightning. And it 
looked like a bunch of Greek white marble statues,

13:06.533 --> 13:11.219
these boys running. They had stripped off every 
bit of their clothing, rolled it up, and put it

13:11.259 --> 13:16.365
under their hats. When I got the guy in Hall's 
basement, they were putting on their dry clothes

13:16.868 --> 13:22.193
ready to paint. Well, that showed a little bit of 
ingenuity. Yes. But you mentioned painting the

13:27.578 --> 13:32.562
scenery for the senior class play. Yes. Was that 
during your senior year? Yes, that was it. Do you

13:37.206 --> 13:38.448
remember what the play was? No, I don't. Was that a 
regular custom that the senior class put on a play?

13:43.872 --> 13:44.513
Yes. Did they charge admission then to the 
students, or was it a free performance? Gee, I

13:51.039 --> 13:52.100
don't remember. We took it over to Brian, I know, 
and had some performances over there. Well, I was

13:58.868 --> 14:01.652
interested in that. No one else had ever mentioned 
to me that the senior class had put on a play.

14:09.381 --> 14:15.428
Were there any other performances

14:09.381 --> 14:15.428
of that type that were put on during the year that 
students could go to, say other than the picture

14:15.863 --> 14:23.394
show and the senior class play? Did any of the other 
classes put on a play? I don't think so. Were there

14:27.500 --> 14:33.349
any outside people coming in to lecture or things 
of that nature? We didn't have very much of that

14:34.350 --> 14:38.817
back then. Did you go to the YMCA to play games or 
anything of that sort? Oh yes. What sorts of games

14:45.754 --> 14:47.476
did you play over there? Well I believe we had pool 
and of course Casey's Confectionery was in the

14:48.637 --> 15:04.433
basement over there and it was quite a hangout 
place if you had 15 cents for a molded milk.

15:05.020 --> 15:08.404
At one point there was a swimming pool in the 
basement of the Y. Was that there when you were

15:08.805 --> 15:11.949
there or was that later? I don't recall that. 
Because I think the Y must have been fairly new when

15:16.394 --> 15:19.258
you were there. Was that in about 1914 or something 
like that when it was opened?

15:29.135 --> 15:33.060
I noticed you attained ultimately the rank of 
second lieutenant. Did the officers in the Corps

15:33.500 --> 15:42.831
enjoy any particular privileges that were not 
available to the regular students?

15:46.055 --> 15:55.266
As far as I know, they had a staff table in the dining 
hall for the regimental staff. But the cadet

15:55.286 --> 15:58.129
officers ate with their companies. So it would 
just be, but they had the same, the regimental

15:59.122 --> 16:03.288
officers had the same food. Yes. Except they just 
didn't have any freshmen at their table. Yeah,

16:07.214 --> 16:11.420
that's right. Okay. Did you have any favorite 
teachers or instructors when you were at A&M?

16:21.795 --> 16:23.918
I don't believe so. I think your field was 
architecture. Was Ernest Langford there at all

16:27.809 --> 16:29.131
when you were there? I don't believe he was there. I 
have known him since very well. I hope you get a

16:37.524 --> 16:39.647
chance you'll give him a call. Oh, I certainly 
will. He was my predecessor as archivist. Yes, I

16:44.054 --> 16:45.096
know. And so I'll certainly try to give him a call 
and give him your regards. I'd appreciate that.

16:53.088 --> 16:58.234
What sort of feelings did the students have 
towards the administration of the school? And I

16:58.855 --> 17:12.892
think there was a dual kind of administration with 
President Bazell, more or less in charge of the

16:58.855 --> 17:12.892
academic end of it, and the commandant of the bull 
in charge of the military end. That's right.

17:16.156 --> 17:21.362
Did the students think pretty highly of both of 
these people? I think so. Who was the commandant

17:22.670 --> 17:24.732
when you were there? Bull Muller. Muller? Muller. 
Now how would you spell that? M-U-E-L-L-E-R, I

17:30.499 --> 17:33.122
believe. And then Ike Ashman was there at the later 
years. I gather he was a fairly popular... Very,

17:41.412 --> 17:42.754
very popular. I was fortunate that I belonged to a 
little club they called the Junta. there. A few

17:51.662 --> 18:16.909
faculty members organized this and then they each 
selected one senior cadet and they each member

17:51.662 --> 18:16.909
presented a paper sometime during the year but 
they were men like Ike Ashburn and D. X. Bible and

17:51.662 --> 18:16.909
Tommy Mayo the librarian, Mr. Thomas from the 
English department and so forth. I appreciated

18:19.029 --> 18:21.712
getting to know those men. So you had this junta, or 
club, was made up of half faculty and half senior

18:21.732 --> 18:29.983
students? Yes, each faculty member invited one 
cadet. You might ask McQuillan about that, he was a

18:34.629 --> 18:40.416
member. Did the students as well as the faculty 
members present papers? Yes, on any subject you

18:43.582 --> 18:46.606
chose. It didn't have to be the field in which you 
were majoring. No. Do you have any recollection of

18:49.910 --> 18:53.114
what you presented a paper on? Yes, I do. I 
presented a paper on the characteristics of a

18:55.096 --> 19:03.287
people as revealed in their monumental 
architecture. Of course, if you study it enough,

19:07.953 --> 19:15.683
practically reveals every facet of their lives, 
political, religious, social, and everything.

19:15.923 --> 19:24.795
From what I have learned of Dr. Mayo since I've been 
at A&M, I gather that must have been a kind of paper

19:15.923 --> 19:24.795
that would have interested him. In his later life, 
at least, he was interested in the cycles between

19:24.855 --> 19:37.892
romantic and realistic in art and architecture 
and literature. He was quite a brilliant man.

19:41.403 --> 19:45.728
Anything I have heard about him indicates that 
that was the case.

19:51.355 --> 19:59.104
Do you remember anything about the customs or 
traditions which were in existence when you were

19:51.355 --> 19:59.104
there?

20:02.628 --> 20:05.652
We know there was some amount of hazing things of 
that nature. Was there a bonfire for the

20:07.248 --> 20:15.880
University of Texas football game or for any other 
football game that you remember? I don't remember

20:16.040 --> 20:20.666
about that.

20:20.686 --> 20:25.112
What about a muster on 21st of April?

20:28.737 --> 20:31.521
I don't recall that on the campus either. Well, 
that's sort of a big day today,

20:33.307 --> 20:40.980
currently I should say.

20:43.865 --> 20:46.829
Were there any girls in any of the classes that you 
attended? No, there were one or two girls who were

20:48.652 --> 20:58.409
daughters of professors that went to classes, but 
I was not in a class with one of them. Do you remember

20:58.429 --> 20:59.871
who the girls were?

21:05.453 --> 21:05.934
No. Okay.

21:10.360 --> 21:18.090
We know that at least a portion of the students who 
were on campus when you were there had employment

21:10.360 --> 21:18.090
of one type or other. Did you have any employment 
while you were at school? Yes, I did. When I was a

21:25.179 --> 21:35.393
freshman, I worked student labor in the 
Department of Drawing for Scripp Mitchell and I

21:35.947 --> 21:39.943
filed and recorded grades on drawings. 15 cents an 
hour. About how many hours did you put in in a week?

21:46.932 --> 21:49.135
No, not many. Architecture requires a gradient of 
time from a student. So there's Mr. Mitchell, you

21:53.160 --> 21:55.904
called him script. He would grade the drawings. 
Yes, and then I would record the grades in his

21:58.427 --> 22:07.759
record books and then file the drawings as they 
were returned to the students at the end of this. So

22:07.739 --> 22:11.322
you had a separate file for each student then, I 
take it? I don't know how we did it exactly, or

22:11.342 --> 22:15.786
classes anyway. At the end of the year, the student 
would get all of these drawings back? Yes. Did you

22:20.109 --> 22:21.070
have any other? I also worked for the Extension 
Department making charts and graphs, you know, or

22:23.733 --> 22:37.324
circle divided into segments, different 
percentage. And I was really going good on that

22:37.456 --> 22:42.921
there by the time I graduated. They were paying me 
50 cents an hour for it, and I was getting students

22:43.001 --> 22:51.229
to do it for 25, 10 cents over their student rate. 
And I remember at the Dallas Fair, I think we did

22:51.890 --> 22:57.695
about $40 worth of work. That was a big deal. This 
was for the Agricultural Extension Service

22:59.036 --> 23:01.979
there? Yes.

23:05.215 --> 23:08.840
or any other things that you can recall along that 
line that you did? No, I don't think so. Did you work

23:12.305 --> 23:16.271
for the, I take it you worked for the Extension 
Service for what, more than one year? Yes. Oh, we

23:18.434 --> 23:26.406
started out making, you know, like plans of a pig 
feeding crawl for a chicken deal or something.

23:26.426 --> 23:34.478
This would be for some of the, this would be some of 
the bullet, that they use these illustrations in

23:26.426 --> 23:34.478
some of the bulletins,

23:26.426 --> 23:34.478
uh-huh. Okay. Did the students who participated 
in athletics, like on the college football team or

23:35.270 --> 23:48.888
the basketball team, have any privileges that 
normal, regular students didn't enjoy? Not that I

23:48.909 --> 23:52.253
know of. A couple of people have said they knew that 
they had a training table. Well, I know they had

23:55.217 --> 23:56.679
that. They ate. But I don't know what they ate. Do 
you know Henry Harrison over in Bryan? Doctor?

24:06.865 --> 24:07.606
Veterinarian? No. He's one of my classmates. He 
was on the football team. I believe Huron Allen

24:14.695 --> 24:18.059
mentioned him. He had some pictures of a 1919 
football team. He mentioned Chick Harrison, I

24:21.583 --> 24:24.567
believe he was called. That's the boy. Oh, another 
job I had was, I believe it was a custom that the team

24:26.309 --> 24:35.500
that won the game got to kept the to keep the 
football they were playing with at the end of the

24:35.800 --> 24:38.904
game. And for the athletic department, we put the 
game and the score on those footballs, and I did

24:39.945 --> 24:47.715
that for a while. You did that. I have a couple of 
those footballs in the archives. One is the 1939

24:50.979 --> 24:56.847
National Championship ball and it's signed by I 
think everybody who played on the team and it has to

24:57.113 --> 25:04.144
score. See I believe they played Tulane I believe 
in that game and I have that one and I believe I have

25:04.224 --> 25:16.965
another one when we beat the University of Texas 
and pointed to nothing I believe in that score is on

25:04.224 --> 25:16.965
there. Of course I was down there when we had those 
two years of I believe we were unscored on for two

25:22.443 --> 25:25.126
whole years. I believe so. In 1917 and 1919, the 
football team was unscored on.

25:33.717 --> 25:45.471
One of the things which happened while you were 
there was this incident of some Aggies going over

25:33.717 --> 25:45.471
to Austin to brand their longhorn steer. Did you 
have any knowledge about that? Not until it was all

25:50.737 --> 25:52.399
over.

25:55.417 --> 26:14.200
Along the same line, we have some indication in the 
archives that this same steer was later butchered

25:55.417 --> 26:14.200
and they had a banquet over at Austin to which

25:55.417 --> 26:14.200
some people from A&M and some people from Austin 
were invited. Did you have any indication of this

26:16.343 --> 26:20.328
while you were studying? No. We have reason to 
believe that it was in January of 1920 We have a copy

26:25.049 --> 26:36.659
of an invitation to it, but we haven't found out 
anything else about

26:25.049 --> 26:36.659
it. Did you have any opportunity to participate in 
either the First or the Second World War? I only

26:42.264 --> 26:49.910
belonged to the Students Army Training Corps that 
they had there at college.

26:52.112 --> 26:54.634
And that was during, what, your junior year? 1918 
and 19? Yes. Actually, it was only the fall part of

26:57.841 --> 27:06.752
1918, I guess, and you were discharged and 
enrolled in regular school again in January. Yes,

27:06.773 --> 27:09.937
we were discharged in December of that year. And 
then by the time the second one rolled around while

27:11.218 --> 27:15.424
you were Overage is for me. Not quite overage, but I 
did construction work principally under the

27:18.897 --> 27:27.849
Corps of Engineers. So you were sort of a civilian 
employee for the Corps of Engineers. Well, not for

27:32.855 --> 27:37.061
contractors who were working for them. It was sort 
of a necessary defense job. Yeah, we did the

27:40.265 --> 27:44.871
Longhorn Ordnance Plant over on Caddo Lake, And 
then I went up to Canada and I was at Whitehorse for

27:45.695 --> 27:59.411
about a year on the building the pipeline up there.

28:01.954 --> 28:14.689
Let's see, I noticed that according to your 
Longhorn in 1920, you were in Bee Company the

28:01.954 --> 28:14.689
second regiment here as a fish, and then you 
switched to E Company. Was that a fairly common

28:19.260 --> 28:22.924
practice, switching from company to company? 
Well, I was probably one of the least military men

28:23.545 --> 28:33.018
on the campus, or that's ever been there, and I 
think they were glad to get me out and be second. It

28:33.038 --> 28:36.682
was a real fine military company. Uh-huh. So what 
did they... Well, E was good, but I mean they

28:36.863 --> 28:40.187
weren't They were a little bit more 
run-of-the-mill. I gather there was a pretty

28:47.077 --> 28:53.664
fierce competition between the companies, was 
there not? Yes. For outstanding grades or what

28:54.504 --> 29:01.191
have you in drill. So did you request a switch to E or 
did somebody request that for you? I don't

29:06.237 --> 29:07.558
remember.
