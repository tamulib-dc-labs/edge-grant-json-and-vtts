WEBVTT

00:05.178 --> 00:06.440
Okay, so this general? So this general, General 
Vogel, who was commanding at Camp at the San Diego

00:08.502 --> 00:21.158
area, was going to go to Parris Island. He said, do I 
want to go along? I said, no, I can't go that far

00:22.500 --> 00:24.282
back. There ain't no war at Parris Island. I'm 
going to stick here. So it wasn't 24 hours that I was

00:29.930 --> 00:35.016
ordered to sing back. assigned to the staff of the 
commanding officer of Pacific Fleet Sing Pack.

00:40.068 --> 00:41.150
And was that in Hawaii? In Hawaii. So then I was 
assigned to the...

00:43.716 --> 00:54.037
Let me get my own pen for this shit. Maybe it'll make 
a note for you.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.181
All right. And I organized a battalion there in 
Pearl Harbor and participated in the assault on

01:14.902 --> 01:22.693
Guam. Now... Tell me about that.

01:30.004 --> 01:32.628
Well, I just had a battalion in the assault on Guam. 
That was it. And when it was secured, then we got to

01:33.389 --> 01:38.576
be the island command. See? And my command, that 
same general there ran the whole island. During

01:43.660 --> 01:47.825
the assault, you commanded a battalion. The 
battalion went ashore. Yeah, it went ashore, but

01:49.307 --> 01:52.932
it was a headquartered battalion. We just had 
outpost skirmishes around.

01:57.738 --> 02:00.281
So you weren't on the frontal assault? Yes, we 
were. Not the frontal assault, no. As soon as they

02:03.305 --> 02:05.889
secured the beachhead, then you went ashore? No, 
we hadn't been secured yet. They were still

02:10.534 --> 02:12.537
fighting when I went ashore.

02:25.021 --> 02:26.885
Did that one say Guam? Wait a minute.

02:34.041 --> 02:37.128
All right. I'll just read you the part you want to 
hear. Okay, fine.

02:55.227 --> 03:13.587
Colonel Baraka landed with the assault units in 
initial landing with Guam, with 5th Corps, and

02:55.227 --> 03:13.587
continued in that status until the enemy, until 
the enemy and mortar and artillery fire at Agate

02:55.227 --> 03:13.587
landing area at our first command post in the 
vicinity of Delvin. Carrying out military

03:13.627 --> 03:24.238
assignments, he came under heavy sniper fire on 
the 25th of July, 1944, and he was on duty

03:13.627 --> 03:24.238
reconnoitering the location for a forward 
command post which duty he performed on the

03:24.607 --> 03:29.273
intense enemy sniper and small-arm fire. Again, 
at PD about this same period, Colonel Baraka was on

03:29.293 --> 03:41.570
the enemy sniper fire from the Japanese forces who 
had been bypassed by our troops or who had

03:29.293 --> 03:41.570
infiltrated into our position. Establishing our 
CP at the base of Mount Tenya, Colonel Baraka and

03:42.351 --> 03:51.103
his unit came on the enemy grenade and fire when he 
commanded his fifth caliber machine gun crew and

03:51.725 --> 03:57.692
wiped out the enemy detachment. That was my 
combat.

04:02.338 --> 04:02.899
You got it all? They did get it? Sure.

04:09.647 --> 04:10.268
All right. That was it. When they give you these 
citations, they don't lie, see? But that

04:17.577 --> 04:19.960
citation, that's how they had them. advanced me to 
Brigadier on the retired list. Oh, it did? Sure. It

04:25.654 --> 04:26.495
says so there. So that was one of the main reasons 
for Brigadier, for your promotion. Oh, hell, I was

04:32.762 --> 04:34.684
going to be made Brigadier, maybe. I was number 
five, number seven on the list of colonels. I could

04:38.769 --> 04:40.671
have made it, but you know what I mean. I'm not a 
politician. I knew I had that record, and I knew

04:43.514 --> 04:46.037
what the law was. When I had to retire, I knew they 
had to promote me. I didn't have a bad record. If I'd

04:52.218 --> 04:53.800
had a bad record, I wouldn't have done anything. 
All right, now we're coming from that. Now we're on

04:56.783 --> 04:57.864
Guam. Now, here's something I don't like to write 
about. In the middle of one morning, along about 4

05:01.008 --> 05:18.786
o'clock, I was relieved of my battalion to quell a 
riot, which was supposed to have happened. in the

05:20.285 --> 05:35.424
city of a canyon where, at some prior time, some 
seabee had killed one of the black Navy troops over

05:20.285 --> 05:35.424
that, over the embarkation area. It was a black and 
tan outfit where they unloaded ships on, oh

05:36.506 --> 05:45.938
hell, I can't call the name. Landing ships? 
Transports? No, no, no, no, no. It's a hollow big

05:49.996 --> 05:51.582
piece of metal. You link them together. Christ, I 
can't. I'm too old.

06:04.227 --> 06:11.299
Anyhow, when you can't get up on the beach to unload 
your ships, you put these things together.

06:11.319 --> 06:12.722
They're made out of iron. Sure, they're like 
runways. Oh, what the hell you call them? I can't

06:15.947 --> 06:16.989
think of the word. Anyhow, this outfit was from 
there. They were Seabees. Huh? They were Seabees?

06:23.801 --> 06:24.722
No, they weren't Seabees. They were Navy. They 
were Navy. But the Seabees were also on the island.

06:30.957 --> 06:37.965
And were all the navies, were all they black or were 
they integrated or what? Oh, the navy wasn't

06:38.065 --> 06:41.188
integrated fully yet. Anyhow, some of these 
people got over on this island who had been in the

06:42.389 --> 06:52.921
same outfit over on Siopan that had killed a navy 
nurse and raped her dead body. And killed a

06:54.503 --> 06:57.686
lieutenant in the navy who went there to retrieve 
her body. Some of these people came from that

06:58.427 --> 07:00.289
outfit. Some of the Seabees did? Some of these Navy 
people did. So they decided to come in on a Ganya and

07:04.766 --> 07:14.986
gonna shoot up a Ganya because one of these 
Seabees, one night in a thatched hut, was gonna

07:04.766 --> 07:14.986
come in and visit. And the Seabee said, told him he 
wasn't invited there. About that time this Navy

07:22.628 --> 07:33.287
Black Navy man threw a keyboard knife at him and 
about that time the CB reached in the top of his

07:22.628 --> 07:33.287
thatch hut and filled him with his carbine filled 
him with a hole. I knew nothing about that because

07:33.387 --> 07:38.596
that happened while I'm still a battalion 
commander. But anyhow, the Provo Marshal at the

07:38.616 --> 07:44.046
time was drunk. My commanding officer was very 
impatient, so he was looking for his old pro

07:44.701 --> 07:53.734
marshal from back in Samoa, and his attorney 
generally trusted hands, so I had the job. So I

07:54.895 --> 08:04.228
rushed down into a canyon and got ahold of one 
platoon of the military police, and we flanked

07:54.895 --> 08:04.228
these people. The trucks came in there, 20 trucks, 
and they were loaded. They had hand grenades, they

08:07.874 --> 08:14.623
had tear gas, they had automatics and everything, 
and we flanked them with Tommy guns, and we didn't,

08:15.110 --> 08:21.957
we had 200 of them, and we didn't have to fire a shot. 
So then we put these people into a stockade, and

08:22.358 --> 08:31.167
later on they would try to riot and rock, and Mrs. 
Roseville turned them all loose. And at that

08:31.187 --> 08:44.020
hearing,

08:31.187 --> 08:44.020
a fellow named White, who was the head man of the 
National Association of Advanced Recovered

08:31.187 --> 08:44.020
People, asked to be counseled for the accused on 
the Board of Investigations. It was granted to

08:44.472 --> 08:45.714
him. And of course, as I say, they were all 
convicted. But when they got back to the United

08:51.121 --> 08:54.124
States, they were turned loose. Convicted of 
rioting? They were all convicted of rioting?

08:57.489 --> 09:00.873
Yeah, riot and rioting. Was there a lot of racial 
tension? Or was this the only incident? Only

09:05.679 --> 09:08.122
certain incidents. When the committee came down 
from Washington to ask me about it, about whether

09:13.210 --> 09:18.255
there was any racial segregation and so forth and 
so on like that. I said, I didn't intimidate. I

09:24.302 --> 09:25.102
said, I didn't know. I haven't seen any of it. Well, 
they said, here you got a boatswain killed at a

09:27.165 --> 09:37.195
canteen for Black Navy people and Black Army 
people.

09:40.278 --> 09:42.981
I said, what did you do about this boatswain 
killing this man? I says, I read the report and I

09:43.417 --> 09:47.262
freed him. Why? I says, upon investigation, I 
found out that this was a black Red Cross woman. He

09:54.270 --> 09:57.715
was worried when he was warned to leave her alone 
and leave her alone. And when he went to put him

09:58.175 --> 10:03.642
under arrest, this black woman said she didn't 
come down there to be a whore. She came down there to

10:03.942 --> 10:07.427
be a Red Cross woman. And, uh... He broke arrest, 
and he fired on him. And I says, then again, at the

10:12.306 --> 10:20.595
foot of Mount Tanyar, some of these people held up 
this bus taking this woman to the Red Cross

10:12.306 --> 10:20.595
compound. And another Black Navy boatman who was 
in charge, he fired on him. Kill him? I don't know.

10:29.365 --> 10:30.527
There's no report of being killed. So then you say 
there's no... That's not the word. Not

10:38.412 --> 10:39.373
integration.

10:43.399 --> 10:44.540
I don't know when you feel... Prejudice? 
Prejudice. That's the word. I don't know. I don't

10:50.348 --> 10:51.169
know prejudice. I know anything about it. So in 
that committee, there was a

10:54.013 --> 11:06.310
two-and-a-half-striped black man, and there was 
this great football player by the name of Pollard,

10:54.013 --> 11:06.310
and there was also another black congressman And I 
understand later on... They all came out from

11:08.554 --> 11:10.136
Washington, D.C.? That's right, to 
investigate... This incident? Yeah. No, just in

11:15.123 --> 11:16.825
general. Oh, in general. Oh, okay. Yeah, in 
general. Okay. So I understand they went up and

11:19.849 --> 11:25.657
told that flag secretary, that Admiral Nimitz's 
staff, that redneck down there. Called me a

11:27.519 --> 11:28.560
redneck. Said they didn't get much satisfaction 
out of him. Out of you. That's right. All right.

11:36.210 --> 11:36.651
Now... But did you think of yourself as a redneck? 
Huh? Did you agree with them, what they said? Well,

11:43.730 --> 11:44.711
sure. I didn't give them too much information. I 
told them the truth. I could back up everything I

11:49.236 --> 11:51.778
told them with my record. I had 47 people in my 
headquarters as a Provo Marshal. It wasn't no

11:55.842 --> 11:58.845
bullshit outfit.

12:00.686 --> 12:01.687
Here's a picture of it. I called it Leary Junction. 
The Admiral was named Leary. at this road. He was

12:07.689 --> 12:15.280
taking a prisoner, and this is my headquarters in, 
what's the name, out of that we ran five stockades

12:07.689 --> 12:15.280
of Japanese. We had 30,000 Japanese prisoners on 
there. I had the Navy, I had the Navy brig, and I had

12:18.905 --> 12:28.558
the Marine Corps brig, and I had all the stockades 
of Japanese. That was all part of the job as Provo

12:29.199 --> 12:33.705
Marshal, plus policing the roads. Policing the 
docks. I had control of the rodents. I had to see if

12:37.582 --> 12:40.165
they had rat guards when the ship landed. To keep 
the rats coming, because we had a program of

12:41.327 --> 12:44.430
rodents on the beach. That was all. The roads. The 
building of roads with asphalt. The moving of

12:49.636 --> 12:50.918
asphalt. The moving of ammunition. The moving of 
troops. The moving of... The native personnel,

12:57.344 --> 13:00.728
that all came under the Provo Marshal. Okay, so you 
were in charge of all of those things? That's

13:02.390 --> 13:02.910
right. So in order to do that, I had, as I say here, I 
had one regiment of military policemen. Luckily,

13:10.398 --> 13:13.622
I trained one battalion back in Pearl Harbor. That 
was one of them out of Nucleus. But they only had

13:15.845 --> 13:17.286
rifle specs. They were not schooled as military 
police. We had to school them. Then I had two

13:20.370 --> 13:22.592
battalions of army from Fort... Acosta, Wyoming. 
They were good. They were better than the Marines.

13:26.946 --> 13:29.529
They did all my narcotic work. And they did all that 
because that time a lot of dope was coming in from

13:29.549 --> 13:34.535
China and places like that. Really? That's right. 
Did you have a drug problem on the island? But these

13:40.143 --> 13:43.407
people stopped the drug problem. What kind of 
drugs? I guess cocaine, morphine, stuff they use

13:45.950 --> 13:48.934
up in China. And these people came in and stopped 
the drug problems? They assisted in it. There's

13:55.773 --> 14:05.107
a...

13:55.773 --> 14:05.107
Shit, we could talk here two years about this damn 
thing. That's why I was putting things on the road

14:05.127 --> 14:17.487
there as the...

14:05.127 --> 14:17.487
Every time we get a Marine killed, you see, we put 
one of them signs up to try to keep him from...

14:21.550 --> 14:27.436
There's a pro, there he is, there's a son of a bitch.

14:27.456 --> 14:31.620
Here's when I had the battalion, Margaret Chase 
came down from Maine. Really? Into my command

14:32.361 --> 14:34.624
post, and the shooting hadn't stopped yet. No 
kidding? That's right. That's who she is.

14:38.588 --> 14:39.088
Senator. There's the old Olympia, was in the 
Spanish-American War, which came down there as a

14:39.569 --> 14:46.596
tender carrying ammunition.

14:51.993 --> 14:54.256
There's a flight mess when we were bringing back 
some wounded. There's raising the flag on Guam.

15:00.646 --> 15:04.511
There's my army liaison in my headquarters.

15:12.343 --> 15:15.207
How many of your officers on your staff are 
lawyers? Three of them. And how many officers on

15:17.350 --> 15:18.972
your staff? 47.

15:22.098 --> 15:23.540
And how many men in your command? Well, my command, 
my command was this regimental military

15:24.481 --> 15:30.890
policeman and the two battalions of army. Okay.

15:36.599 --> 15:38.081
There's the old goat right there. Mm-hmm. We'd 
take some Japanese Britain and I wouldn't. We got

15:43.889 --> 15:45.431
these off a submarine. Mm-hmm.

15:51.832 --> 15:54.536
I said, Jesus Christ, I got more damn material 
here. But tell me about your prisoners. All right,

15:58.101 --> 15:59.763
we're going to finish now. Tell me about the 
Japanese prisoners. Okay.

16:17.188 --> 16:20.893
We took the Japanese, you know, when we landed 
there, we They were all mixed up with Chemorins.

16:25.324 --> 16:29.730
The island of Saipan is just across, and it's the 
same nationality. And these people have been

16:29.750 --> 16:32.114
going back and forth through the years. After

16:33.436 --> 16:47.315
the assault was over, it was my job to get those 
civilians out of there. That is, we let them stay

16:47.335 --> 16:50.880
there until they were all filtered out. Well, in 
order to do that, we had to have the G2 people take

16:51.434 --> 16:56.523
care of that. We had people, Marines could speak 
Japanese. Incidentally, they had a school back in

17:00.449 --> 17:03.755
Samoa that taught Japanese and English. I can tell 
you a lot of stuff, but anyhow.

17:08.543 --> 17:12.990
So, we had these different stockades. And as 
they'd bring these prisoners in, of course,

17:16.325 --> 17:23.013
They'd interrogate them and so forth for the G2 
people so they'd get the word out to the people in

17:16.325 --> 17:23.013
the field how many more Japs there was. Remember, 
we got to show you, we were getting in Japs there

17:23.053 --> 17:31.283
even after I left Guam, many years after that.

17:33.286 --> 17:43.058
Anyhow, I

17:33.286 --> 17:43.058
had no trouble with the Japanese prisoners 
themselves. because I had to have one stockade for

17:44.033 --> 17:48.941
Japanese officers. They didn't want to work. If 
you worked, I'd give you 1,200 calories of food a

17:50.363 --> 17:53.308
day. If you didn't, I'd lessen the calories down. 
We formed these people out each day to different

17:58.055 --> 18:03.984
divisions. The third division, the brigades, the 
army, and the Navy and any all the troops who were

18:09.329 --> 18:12.352
stationed on the island. We'd portion out a 
certain many of Japanese prisoners. They'd take

18:15.094 --> 18:20.679
and work them and feed them on their own command and 
bring them back in in the evenings. Were they

18:22.500 --> 18:24.402
pretty good workers? We all had to work them. Sure 
they were good workers. They all worked. But one

18:28.506 --> 18:31.428
time we had a very thing happen. We had a whole 
medical battalion from Iwo of Japanese and Some

18:39.788 --> 18:55.353
naval doctors thought it would be a good idea for

18:39.788 --> 18:55.353
the people to have these Japanese doctors look 
after the Japanese. So I agreed to all that. The

18:59.380 --> 19:04.648
first thing you know, 90% of the Japanese are on 
sick report. so they wouldn't have to wait. So I

19:06.704 --> 19:07.805
changed that. I put a sick call at 3 o'clock in the 
morning and immediately there was no more

19:08.065 --> 19:13.391
problems.

19:16.835 --> 19:18.857
Because everybody depended on the Japanese. Back 
in the back area, you take a division that's been up

19:18.937 --> 19:24.322
in combat, come back to the back area to rest. There 
was a lot of work the police and these Japs could do,

19:24.342 --> 19:27.766
and they did it. And we let the Red Cross use them. I 
let them use them until I went by there one day and

19:30.509 --> 19:33.572
made an inspection. They had them sitting down 
there and tea with them, which was against the

19:33.940 --> 19:36.764
rules. So no more, they didn't get any more 
prisoners. But the 20th Air Force got them, the

19:40.608 --> 19:45.074
B-29 field got them, and we got them all. So they do 
manual labor? Yeah, yeah. Then we had two trucks

19:49.740 --> 19:55.487
going around the island picking up cans and things 
like that because Admiral Nimitz wanted the

19:49.740 --> 19:55.487
island cleaned up. I'll give you, I think I, man, I 
don't know. Was there a lot of hatred? A lot of what?

20:03.821 --> 20:04.242
Hatred? No. I only had one trouble one time. I 
didn't have any trouble. I was allowed under the

20:10.811 --> 20:15.197
Articles of War just so much. Well, I had all those 
prisoners, and it was impossible to give them,

20:16.139 --> 20:25.752
give each one of them a pair of shoes or give them 
this and this and the other. So what I did, I saved

20:25.772 --> 20:32.702
the shoes for the Marines and just cut a piece of 
wood They made sandals out of wood and a string, and

20:33.458 --> 20:36.643
that was it. They were useless, and everybody was 
happy. But everything went along all right until I

20:38.706 --> 20:49.903
ran into a psychological warfare officer from the 
University of Chicago, a two-and-a-half

20:38.706 --> 20:49.903
strapper, and he complained about this incident, 
because I'm about to tell you. My commanding

20:49.923 --> 20:56.072
general told me to carry out the Articles of War as 
far as it was practical. He also told me to use my own

20:56.092 --> 21:01.440
judgment in any matters that arise. The article of 
war says you don't parade the prisoners after

21:01.910 --> 21:04.954
dark. I got a signal from the G2 staff FMF pack that 
all the G2s of the six divisions were coming in to

21:07.137 --> 21:17.171
Guam and wanted to check the stockade.

21:20.396 --> 21:25.723
It was way after dark when the lieutenant called 
me, and I ordered him to parade the prisoners.

21:28.977 --> 21:43.095
There was one officer, the head of the prison, 
named by Colonel Mac Pate, who later got to be

21:28.977 --> 21:43.095
commandant of the Marine Corps, whose father was a 
classmate of one of these naval officers, a Navy

21:28.977 --> 21:43.095
captain, who was taken prisoner and whipped that 
ass down to Guam naked. Anyhow, he had been

21:43.676 --> 21:46.700
repatriated, and he wrote back. So this officer 
went in there, this Colonel Pate, who was the head

21:47.361 --> 21:55.491
of this G-2 team, and it was after dark. And I asked 
him, he says, did you ever think that a lot of us like

21:57.226 --> 22:03.994
to cut your down throat? And he bowed. And he says, 
he called for a certain Jap by the name of Shimizu.

22:13.385 --> 22:16.009
So the sergeant said, Shimizu, front and center. 
And what do you do? He said, I'm the baker. Shimizu

22:19.332 --> 22:38.135
was commissioned by the emperor who had set up all 
this

22:19.332 --> 22:38.135
hatred between the Gormanians, the Chemurans, 
and also the Chemurans from Saipan. He had free run

22:38.175 --> 22:40.758
there, but his name was Shimizu. So he said, did you 
ever stop things like cut your throat? So this

22:45.344 --> 22:48.748
Japanese says, yes, I did, and he bowed. Well, they 
asked a lot of other questions, and I had some

22:48.813 --> 22:54.078
Gonzukas. The Gonzukas were Korean prisoners 
from the Japanese. It was Japanese that made them

22:57.641 --> 23:01.105
work, and they called them Gonzukas. So we had some 
of them lined up there, and we had tags on them. So

23:06.570 --> 23:12.656
Colonel Payton asked me, he says, what does that 
mean? I said, well, he's a metalsmith. He's a this,

23:14.257 --> 23:15.999
he's a that, he's the other. So...

23:21.398 --> 23:26.744
So

23:21.398 --> 23:26.744
I said, and the pigs, they age.

23:29.968 --> 23:32.271
So they went and asked questions here, there, and 
everywhere. And then they finally went up on the

23:32.291 --> 23:37.197
hill and said, what are those two little chick 
sails you got up there? I said, those I got two

23:37.217 --> 23:46.208
guys eating one of the cannibals. I says, uh, well, 
he said, we'd like to go up there. I said, for what?

23:53.629 --> 23:56.072
He said, well, I saw the entourage. I went on up 
there with them. And, uh, one of these naval

23:58.395 --> 24:05.484
officers, a naval officer was there, off Admiral 
Limited's staff. He wanted to see what they looked

24:05.944 --> 24:07.386
like. So he tapped on there, and the sergeant says, 
he's indisposed right now. So he wanted to know why

24:13.373 --> 24:15.236
he was indisposed. He says, well, he's taking, 
moving his bowels in a bucket. Anyhow, after that,

24:19.870 --> 24:24.194
we brought him out and looked at him anyhow, and 
started another one over there on the hill. Well,

24:25.296 --> 24:27.237
why can't you keep them with the other Japs? I said, 
well, that's the only hatred in here. I said, well,

24:29.099 --> 24:31.782
I put that Jap loose down here, he'll be dead in five 
minutes. So anyhow... The people of Guam hated

24:34.545 --> 24:36.527
him. Huh? So the people of Guam... Yeah, they'd 
beat the hell out of them. They'd beat them and

24:38.809 --> 24:41.632
raped them and everything else while they were 
there. So the people of Guam hated him. Oh, yeah,

24:43.054 --> 24:45.036
they were really mean to him. Anyhow, the... So

24:49.402 --> 25:05.885
the next day, I get a report from my commanding 
general to come see him, and I got my jeep and I went

24:49.402 --> 25:05.885
up to see what it was all about, and he asked me, he 
said, you did your parade to prisoners last night.

25:05.905 --> 25:06.586
I said, I did, sir. He says, anything happen? I 
said, nothing that unusual. He says, well,

25:14.777 --> 25:17.080
this... psychological warfare officer from the 
University of Chicago up there on Nimitz and Stamp

25:17.971 --> 25:27.124
read in hell about that that you permitted a lot of 
unusual things to happen in that stockade last

25:17.971 --> 25:27.124
night. And a lot of things went on. A lot of people 
said things. I said, sir, if there were anything on

25:31.571 --> 25:35.216
the other line, I never heard it. If I'd have said 
what Pete said, Pete never would have been

25:35.717 --> 25:39.021
accommodating Marine Corps. But anyhow, So he 
picked up the telephone and called them into the

25:41.984 --> 25:54.259
headquarters in my presence and said, this island 
is not big enough for that psychological warfare

25:41.984 --> 25:54.259
guy you got up there, and I want him off this island 
by noon today. Those are orders. And he was gone.

25:57.563 --> 25:59.465
That's General Lawson. His father-in-law was 
governor of Colorado, and his brother-in-law was

25:59.765 --> 26:03.430
governor of Colorado. All right, we're down to...

26:09.085 --> 26:12.529
But tell me one last thing before we leave the 
Japanese. Well, hell, I got a picture to show you.

26:15.392 --> 26:16.253
It'll come out of your ass. Well, tell me, how did 
the Americans treat the prisoners? Well, they

26:22.299 --> 26:25.182
were not contact. We didn't have them around them. 
Only time when they went up in working parties.

26:29.467 --> 26:31.309
They didn't shoot. They... You know, the Japanese 
treated the American prisoners really poorly.

26:39.263 --> 26:40.125
Oh, of course they did. I was wondering if we 
treated the Japanese prisoners real poorly. Oh,

26:45.716 --> 26:46.097
no. Uh-uh. No. Why not? Because it wasn't the right 
thing to do. It wasn't the right thing to do. Why,

26:55.014 --> 26:57.098
uh...

27:06.005 --> 27:07.186
I'll give you this picture. That is Lieutenant 
Colonel. What year was this? It's on the list

27:12.853 --> 27:14.895
there.

27:32.655 --> 27:33.936
Self-explanatory. Put it on the back there, Tent 
12. And I found it. And I gave you a picture.

27:45.723 --> 27:47.845
And later on, you'll get a picture of me as a 
general. Of course, you can go up there and look at

27:47.905 --> 27:49.928
it up there. What year was this? This is 1914, 
probably?

27:55.895 --> 27:56.375
What? 1911. 1911.

28:05.590 --> 28:06.992
Let's see, what'd I say I was looking for? Pictures 
of Japanese prisoners.

28:16.286 --> 28:26.781
Orders and requests.

28:26.801 --> 28:28.223
Charge reports.

28:40.403 --> 28:42.325
Brutality, the Chinese against the Japanese. 
1945?

28:56.538 --> 28:58.579
Yeah.

29:04.845 --> 29:08.048
Photos of the Japanese army in China during the 
Signed on Japanese war in 1937. Oh yeah, this is

29:10.351 --> 29:13.754
incredible. These pictures are too horrible for 
publication.

29:21.342 --> 29:32.855
If you wish to reproduce these pictures or use them 
for propaganda purposes in the division, they

29:21.342 --> 29:32.855
should prove very useful in rousing the wrath of 
any right-minded young American against such

29:21.342 --> 29:32.855
barbaric actions. However, I would prefer not to 
have my name associated with them in any way. When

29:39.588 --> 29:46.257
you have made whatever slides or copies you may 
need for your purposes, please give back the

29:39.588 --> 29:46.257
originals to Mrs. Price. Charles F.B. Price. He 
was my general. He was your general? Of the Samoan

29:52.666 --> 29:56.992
Defense Force after General Austin left. There's 
some of the pictures we had, but we did get these

29:57.012 --> 30:01.378
pictures and get them out to the troops. You 
understand that? Oh, you did. You're damn right we

30:03.701 --> 30:04.883
did. to show the brutality of the Japanese.

30:11.807 --> 30:15.671
I don't think you want that, maybe you do, maybe you 
don't. These are incredible. If you want them, you

30:18.655 --> 30:23.460
can take them and reproduce them and send them 
back. Maybe you don't want

30:23.480 --> 30:28.005
them. But those are all the things I had to do. Yeah. 
Give me that, put that down. Those are all the

30:32.951 --> 30:35.173
things they charged me with. You understand? 
Sure. G2 people and all like that. If I say you could

30:39.415 --> 30:43.520
sit in and talk, you'd say, well, you could just be 
blowing smoke up your ass. It's been passed.

30:44.982 --> 30:46.244
You're 87 and a half years old. You're ready to meet 
the maker. What the hell are you? You know? That's

30:51.170 --> 30:52.992
the brutality of the Japanese. And so you'd give 
those pictures... We had them produced and passed

30:53.373 --> 30:58.800
around into divisions. And another reason why...

31:06.068 --> 31:24.647
The Marines didn't want to have taken Jap 
prisoners because in Guadalcanal,

31:06.068 --> 31:24.647
when we made a reconnaissance in force, I wasn't 
there, but Frank Getchie, who was a great football

31:06.068 --> 31:24.647
player, he was in charge of this reconnaissance in 
force. And they underestimated the amount of

31:24.667 --> 31:29.491
resistance they'd get. And 22 of those people were 
wiped out, or maybe 40. And when the Marines went

31:35.414 --> 31:42.646
there to find him, the Japanese had cut the penises 
off of every Marine and stuck it in his mouth. And

31:43.988 --> 31:48.115
after the Marines knew that and heard that, they 
wouldn't take any Japanese prisoners. So we had a

31:48.135 --> 31:52.602
hard time prevailing on Marines to bring in 
prisoners for intelligence service. That's

31:53.624 --> 31:54.426
true. That was at Guadalcanal? That was at 
Guadalcanal. I lost a lot of friends there.

32:12.016 --> 32:15.021
You were speaking about race a minute. Cut it off

32:15.121 --> 32:18.806
now. Tell me, when was this written? Do you 
remember? 1941, I imagine. Where were you when it

32:28.621 --> 32:29.983
was written? Camp Elliot under General Vogel. 
Okay, 1941. And it hired me to hang it tight in the

32:34.630 --> 32:36.694
eye. They knew I did that.

32:42.239 --> 32:43.340
And who did you write it to? I wrote that to the Chief 
of Naval Operations.

32:51.511 --> 32:52.693
You've got the reply back. Okay, the reply's on the 
other side then. Said we wasn't sacrosanct. That

32:58.520 --> 33:00.603
means we had to, you know, fall in line. So what they 
did, they organized a lot of battalions and set

33:01.324 --> 33:04.748
them in the back areas. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

33:10.606 --> 33:14.951
But see, that's where your lawyer comes in and your 
civilian comes in in your service. He wouldn't

33:14.971 --> 33:17.054
dare ask a regular officer to do that. Of course, I 
never was treated as a reserve officer because I'd

33:19.357 --> 33:23.162
been a regular officer. You understand?

33:28.088 --> 33:29.069
So what has happened? You get Marcia Diane coming 
to this country and telling us you've got too many

33:29.970 --> 33:37.660
blacks in the service because they're mentally 
not mentally qualified.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.361
What do you think about that? I'm with him 100%. 
We've had some good black Marines. And I was

33:47.611 --> 33:54.141
sitting, they asked me... You can put this on tape. 
Put it on tape. I just turned it on right now. I was

33:57.226 --> 34:04.317
asked by a board at Camp Pendleton after the war 
what I felt about black personnel. And I said this,

34:05.358 --> 34:09.064
if we can train them properly... and they can hit 
the beach and bury the breast of the battle and die

34:09.888 --> 34:15.996
along with us, I'm for them 100%. But I don't 
believe in giving them anything on account of

34:17.217 --> 34:19.720
their color. Cut it. Cut this. You can edit any of 
this stuff off when I give you the transcript. All

34:26.889 --> 34:27.189
right. So let's just keep it on. Okay. You getting 
tired? No. All right. Let me see. Brutality of the

34:34.150 --> 34:36.293
Japs. I showed you that. And how, what the 
Americans, what did your friends and colleagues

34:37.695 --> 34:44.065
think? What did they think about having these 
prisoner of wars? And what did they think about, I

34:47.731 --> 34:51.977
mean, how did they treat them? The troops were 
never contacted. The only people contacted were

34:55.715 --> 35:00.980
the Marine guards, the Marines. How did the guards 
treat the prisoners? They treated them fairly.

35:07.867 --> 35:13.713
There was always an interpreter or a Marine who 
could speak Japanese with them. They didn't try to

35:13.733 --> 35:15.495
abuse anybody. The only abuse among Japanese was 
among themselves.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.231
You mean they abused each other? Yes. In what way? 
Well, they'd fight. They'd fight with each other?

35:29.117 --> 35:31.840
Sure, every now and then, but very seldom, very 
seldom. We had no trouble. We had no problem. And

35:34.964 --> 35:36.506
they got 1,200 calories a day? Those who worked got 
over that, 1,400 calories. Those who didn't work

35:40.551 --> 35:42.994
got less than 1,100 calories. There were very few 
of them that didn't work. The only ones that didn't

35:45.236 --> 35:49.261
work was that stockade out there with those 
officers. Why didn't they work? Because I was mad

35:50.022 --> 35:52.525
because I had to finish a guard out there. Why 
didn't they want to work? Well, because they

35:54.276 --> 35:55.698
didn't have to. They were officers.

36:00.843 --> 36:04.828
And we couldn't pay the prisoners like we were 
supposed to because there were too many of them.

36:04.848 --> 36:06.630
There wasn't a lot of them. Before prisoners were 
3,000. Now you had 30,000 or more. That's when it

36:11.215 --> 36:17.521
swelled when we took the garrison from Rota. Those 
people had been over there eating frogs and

36:17.541 --> 36:22.647
lizards and rats and everything else. We brought 
them over to Ireland, and we cleaned them all up,

36:22.998 --> 36:30.969
kept them there 15 to 20 days, and then sent them 
back to Japan. Gave them medical? You mean sent

36:34.413 --> 36:36.396
them back to Japan after the war? Yeah. Gave them 
medical? Yeah.

36:50.535 --> 36:51.857
And was the next job... And what was the next job?

37:48.217 --> 37:49.399
I'm trying to tell you. You wanted to see some of the 
Japanese. Has we got them in? Yeah.

37:58.493 --> 38:01.077
Were they real skinny and beat up? Hell no. I got a 
joke to tell on myself, too. Okay, tell me. On top of

38:06.807 --> 38:07.848
the...

38:13.036 --> 38:13.397
Uh...

38:19.081 --> 38:21.405
Well, I had headquarters call it Frog Roost. 
Pacific cemeteries, you don't see that.

38:39.536 --> 38:43.443
And up on, overlooking the Ganya Harbor. Mm-hmm. 
And I lived there with a fellow named Jim Lane, who

38:44.275 --> 38:50.684
was personnel down in the island command. And it 
was just a tent up on coconut logs with a floor in it.

38:55.510 --> 39:01.378
And the Navy stole the icebox and gave it to me for a 
favor. So in

39:01.499 --> 39:12.814
cleaning out during the assault phase, there were 
a lot of Japs tunneled up in these places and they

39:14.161 --> 39:20.486
thought they'd kill them all with the 
flamethrowers. But there were two of them still

39:20.506 --> 39:22.188
living. And I lived on top of them there for over 
eight months. And you didn't know they were living

39:28.113 --> 39:29.494
down there? I didn't know they were living under 
me. And we had a little old

39:31.416 --> 39:37.601
monkey shower there. We've got some pipe and we've 
got a little water and we had a shower and we built a

39:37.621 --> 39:43.746
little bib on the front of our tent And that's where 
we'd take a shower. So he was living off this water

39:45.959 --> 39:48.582
we'd take a shower with. So they liked to hurrah the 
hell out of me about that because we found him down

39:49.603 --> 40:01.058
on... And one day I hung up my utilities and I missed 
him. Well, I thought maybe the wind blew him away.

40:03.721 --> 40:10.510
But the Jap got him and he was down there on a dump at 
the officer's mess prowling around with his

40:03.721 --> 40:10.510
marine clothes on. And I never liked to live that 
down either, but they had my name in them. Oh,

40:14.819 --> 40:16.160
really? Son of a bitch. He stole your clothes and 
went down to the garbage dump? That's right. My

40:23.909 --> 40:26.091
name was in the back of them, right back in here. Was 
he wearing colonel patches? Was he wearing

40:30.096 --> 40:31.758
colonel insignias? Yeah, no, no, he wasn't 
wearing that. So they teased you about that, I bet.

40:37.904 --> 40:38.906
Oh, God, yes. Good day. We read the combat 
citation. I just wanted to show you a few pictures.

40:51.767 --> 40:52.569
Yellow leader. Promotions.

41:00.324 --> 41:01.827
Brutality of the Japs.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.655
That's the song I got when I was in second year of 
university and I composed that. We circulated

41:16.567 --> 41:18.178
that around.

41:46.441 --> 41:47.362
See, you can have that. That's when I was first 
lieutenant on 21st Company.

41:55.615 --> 42:08.836
See, I'm looking for... That

41:55.615 --> 42:08.836
picture, that's some of the Japanese prisoners.

42:08.856 --> 42:10.018
You see that woman in that room?

42:16.394 --> 42:22.603
This

42:16.394 --> 42:22.603
little one right here? Yeah. Where was this? Mark? 
Mark on it.

42:32.697 --> 42:33.618
Why was she in there? Damn, she was on a troop boat. 
They said she's only true to one. She's true to...

42:39.526 --> 42:44.793
She only serves one Jap and that she's true to him. 
That's what they said. and give a damn.

43:24.535 --> 43:26.637
Well, these prisoners are really well-dressed. 
They look really healthy. You don't want to see

43:29.741 --> 43:34.667
these B-29 pictures because I had to do that only. 
They were all my friends out there. A lot of Aggies

43:39.212 --> 43:42.896
out there. Did you have a lot of Aggies on Guam? Oh, 
yeah, I showed you. Yeah, you showed me them. I gave

43:46.881 --> 43:47.762
you one. You got all those damn people? You got it?

44:00.867 --> 44:02.129
to Admiral Nimitz? Did I? Sure did. I had a personal 
letter from him. Really? Will you tell me about it?

44:07.397 --> 44:12.826
When he dropped back to Pearl, he had me come up and 
thank him. He thanked me personally, but he told me

44:12.846 --> 44:26.267
then that the Code of Military Justice wasn't 
going to work, that the old code we had, rules for

44:12.846 --> 44:26.267
the government of the Navy, did work all through 
the years, what we call rocks and shoals. And he

44:28.576 --> 44:31.019
said the brig was going to be filled up with people. 
Now, I'm licensed to practice for the Court of

44:32.902 --> 44:35.846
Military Appeals over there. See it over there? 
But that's the most useless damn thing in the world

44:38.109 --> 44:43.235
because you can't have office hours without a damn 
lawyer being there. Now, I'm a lawyer myself. Why I

44:47.241 --> 44:56.473
have to stand there and worry about a bachelor who 
needs five days of bread and water with a full

44:47.241 --> 44:56.473
ration on the third day when that's all he could do 
and get it. You understand what you can't do that,

44:56.875 --> 44:59.838
but I'm a lawyer. So if the Admiral Nimitz is right, 
the brig's awful. What have you had? Look how many

45:04.724 --> 45:08.207
desertions you've had in all the services. How 
many BCDs? How many of this, that, and the other?

45:13.133 --> 45:21.382
When you start with that discipline in the squad, 
the corporals say to you, all right, Anderson, you

45:13.133 --> 45:21.382
don't go ashore this weekend. You leave your 
liberty card in the rack. And old Anderson goes to

45:24.706 --> 45:26.848
think, what did I do? What did I do? And he knows what 
he did. And you don't have any problem with

45:31.289 --> 45:35.695
Anderson. Then another guy comes up and he does 
something, and he gives him some EPD, vector

45:35.715 --> 45:43.105
police duty to the sergeant there, or the 
corporal. That straightens him out. That stops

45:46.349 --> 45:47.370
him there. Or if he goes up to the platoon 
commander, he'll give him something that's out on

45:48.151 --> 45:52.277
his record. And he'll discipline then. They were 
founded on that through the years aboard ship

45:55.482 --> 46:01.069
every place, see? And then when it went up to the 
company commander, he'd shake you around. And

46:07.136 --> 46:17.208
then if you had a court martial when it went up to the 
battalion commander, he might find some

46:07.136 --> 46:17.208
extenuating circumstances and he'll cut your 
sentence down and it gets up to the division, he'd

46:07.136 --> 46:17.208
cut it down. And when it finally gets to the JAG 
office, This cut down, that's the court of justice

46:21.284 --> 46:30.353
we've been operating through the years, not 
having a goddamn lawyer sitting

46:21.284 --> 46:30.353
there. I had to go out and be a witness out at the Army 
or at Guam. I thought I was in the courthouse down in

46:33.477 --> 46:36.440
Houston, all the damn lawyers. I said, you son of a 
bitch, why haven't you got a rifle or something?

46:40.884 --> 46:42.626
Why aren't you out fighting? The war is not over 
yet. Oh, I'm a legal officer, legal. Well, what did

46:48.412 --> 46:49.553
you think of Nimitz? He was a great admiral. Great 
man. Did you ever meet Bull Halsey? Yes, I met Bull

46:55.423 --> 46:56.906
Halsey. And what did you think of him? He was a great 
fighting man, too. Forward man. He wasn't as

47:02.515 --> 47:07.183
reserved as Admiral Nimitz was, but he was a good 
fighting man. In fact, Admiral Halsey gave me the

47:08.825 --> 47:12.872
order to prosecute people in Samoa. Anybody.
