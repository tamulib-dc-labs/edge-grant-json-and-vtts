WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:16.122
No, football was, I guess Aggies have always been 
wild about football, as everybody is in Texas, I

00:02.444 --> 00:16.122
think. And, you know, we really loved football, 
and knowing a lot of the players, because as a

00:31.638 --> 00:46.903
freshman, that was the first time that the 
football players had lived in the outfits that

00:31.638 --> 00:46.903
year of 1941. Prior to that, they had all lived in 
dorm 12 or a athletic dormitory where they were all

00:51.078 --> 00:54.182
together. But this year was the first time they 
tried an experiment of putting them all back in

00:54.703 --> 00:59.950
there. Did you have any athletes in your outfit?

01:05.817 --> 01:07.380
No, none. Well, we had one, Freddie Walters. You 
know Freddie? He's over there. I think he's still

01:14.088 --> 01:15.290
with the bank. Freddie was in our outfit. He was a 
year ahead of me. And I believe that was the only one

01:20.255 --> 01:26.122
we had in our outfit. All right. On a game day, had 
classes on Saturday morning, and then did you all

01:26.783 --> 01:33.571
march in? Yes. The Corps did march in? Well, wait a 
minute. Let's see. I'm getting to it. No, we didn't

01:42.402 --> 01:43.503
march in. Uh-uh. No. So you just went on your own. 
That's right. But in uniform. When I say we didn't

01:47.608 --> 01:49.350
march in, we usually went in behind the band. But, I 
mean, there was no, not like they do now and really

01:52.326 --> 01:57.093
have a march in. No, we just went on our own. What 
were some memorable moments for you of that fall's

02:00.317 --> 02:04.402
football season?

02:08.047 --> 02:17.540
Well...

02:17.560 --> 02:18.321
I don't know. I just... Did you go to some 
out-of-town games? Oh yes, yes. Well, we had a

02:24.393 --> 02:37.151
court trip to, let's see, my freshman year we had a 
court trip to Dallas and Fort Worth. It seemed

02:39.034 --> 02:42.118
like- Now normally didn't go to Oh, wait a minute. 
No, one year we went, I'm trying to think, we were

02:43.988 --> 02:48.594
sophomores when we went to Fort Worth. I guess we 
went to Dallas as freshmen. Dallas and Houston?

02:54.142 --> 02:54.823
And Houston. Yeah, yeah. The Houston

02:58.769 --> 03:10.806
trip was, let's see.

03:12.524 --> 03:24.255
Well, anyway, let's go back to a few days before the 
Houston game, the Rice game.

03:24.435 --> 03:31.902
We had some adventurous freshmen who decided 
they'd steal Sammy the Rice Owl. And they did. They

03:34.265 --> 03:40.050
got down there and they got Sammy from the trophy 
case and got outside the building, but they didn't

03:40.756 --> 03:47.485
get off campus. They were caught. And

03:50.730 --> 03:58.861
there was a picture, I believe, in the Post. It 
might have been the Chronicle. I think it was They

04:02.542 --> 04:15.894
caught these Aggies, and they shaved their heads, 
with the exception of four of them, and they left an

04:02.542 --> 04:15.894
R, an I, C, E. And they had them all down on all fours.

04:18.557 --> 04:20.298
And they took their picture. And I believe it was in 
the Houston Post. I'm not sure. But anyway, they

04:24.862 --> 04:30.928
get back to College Station.

04:32.039 --> 04:43.479
the paper comes out and anyway the Bulls office 
figures we're going to have these guys nailed.

04:43.539 --> 04:56.983
Well, they didn't count on the ingenuity of some 
Aggies, so every outfit we drew straws

04:59.056 --> 05:02.584
One boy in every outfit had to have his head shaved. 
So they did, and as far as I know, Joe Davis, who was

05:04.268 --> 05:14.972
just an assistant at that time, they never caught 
anybody. for pulling the steel. Did you students

05:19.727 --> 05:24.533
know who the two guilty parties, the four guilty 
parties? I knew two of them. But you all knew who

05:26.094 --> 05:27.616
they were? Oh yes, oh yes. Let's see, how did, when 
you went on a court trip, how did that first year,

05:31.400 --> 05:36.006
how did you get there? By some, or any way you could. 
But did you hitchhike? Oh yes, yes. Describe how an

05:43.226 --> 05:45.849
Aggie hitchhiked in that era. What'd you wear? 
Where'd you catch the ride? Well, we usually

05:48.531 --> 05:56.039
caught out right up there at, which

05:48.531 --> 05:56.039
was East Gate. And there's very, very definite 
strict rules about hitchhiking. You'd go out and

06:03.567 --> 06:06.850
you'd get in line. You'd put on a little suitcase or 
whatever and It might be a long line, but the ones

06:11.281 --> 06:20.974
that were there first went out first, and this had 
absolutely nothing to do with whether you were a

06:11.281 --> 06:20.974
senior freshman or whatever. This was who was 
there first. And

06:24.038 --> 06:29.345
sometimes they wouldn't take a ride. Maybe the 
ride would just be to Hearn, and the guy would say,

06:29.425 --> 06:36.655
no thanks, I don't want that. Well, then the next 
guy got a choice, and so on and so forth. And

06:40.559 --> 07:00.790
speaking of that, one time I remember taking the 
line to go towards, we were going to San Antonio,

06:40.559 --> 07:00.790
and the line towards Austin was so long that I don't 
think I'd ever gotten out that a fella stopped and

06:40.559 --> 07:00.790
said, he's going to Caldwell. Nobody wanted to 
ride to Caldwell, so another fella and I took the

07:02.433 --> 07:08.001
ride to Caldwell. Then when we got to Caldwell, we 
caught right north to, well, we ended up in Taylor.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.103
I've forgotten, Cameron. We went up to Cameron and 
then over to Taylor. And by this time, it's the

07:24.447 --> 07:30.415
Friday night football game. It's just over in 
Taylor. So you can see it took us a little while to

07:34.080 --> 07:36.503
get there. and there were some girls driving 
around in the car, and we got to talking to them.

07:43.486 --> 07:52.398
They stopped, and we finally talked them into, if 
we'd buy them two gallons of gas, would they drive

07:43.486 --> 07:52.398
us down to Austin? And they did. So anyway, but the 
Corps trips, we had great times. I know The year we

08:05.710 --> 08:15.662
went to Fort Worth,

08:05.710 --> 08:15.662
God, there must have been 10 of us in that room. I 
don't know whose room it was, but it was just a place

08:16.242 --> 08:20.447
to lay down and sleep. That was the year that we

08:21.629 --> 08:34.924
had to publicly give back the Horned Frog flag. And 
we had a couple of boys that during the game went up

08:36.862 --> 08:51.638
that flagpole and took that pennant loose and came 
back down and got away without being caught. Now,

08:51.899 --> 09:05.974
you know, if I don't know if you're familiar with 
the stadium at that time, but the flagpole was at

08:51.899 --> 09:05.974
the north end and the play, everything was going on 
down at the south end at that time and it was rather

09:06.713 --> 09:33.733
tense and these two guys were up that pole and had 
that deal and were getting ready to come down

09:06.713 --> 09:33.733
before anybody really noticed that they were 
there before the crowd turned around and by the

09:06.713 --> 09:33.733
time they hit the ground they were gone and anyway 
they had to make a presentation back to Did you ever

09:36.683 --> 09:43.292
have a bad experience as an Aggie hitchhiker?

09:49.200 --> 09:54.247
I'm going to answer this like you don't want to 
hear, but I say no. I've not had a single negative

09:54.867 --> 09:57.291
report yet. Did you have any humorous events while 
hitchhiking? Goofy? Well, I... I had a very

10:06.046 --> 10:16.540
embarrassing event one time, and a fellow and I had 
caught a ride. And by the way, this was to Caldwell

10:16.580 --> 10:22.228
again. And

10:24.511 --> 10:35.125
so happened the gentleman we caught a ride with was 
a preacher.

10:37.349 --> 10:49.746
a boy I was with, nice, I mean, true blue kind of a 
friend and so on and so forth, but a rather raucous,

10:37.349 --> 10:49.746
rough type fella. And his language was really 
pretty bad and the preacher took him to task and

10:49.967 --> 11:01.703
gave him quite a quite a little sermon

11:02.628 --> 11:31.774
which was well deserved well deserved but it was 
still embarrassing it was still embarrassing

11:02.628 --> 11:31.774
but anyway that's a

11:02.628 --> 11:31.774
but all right then back to uh football that year um 
let's see this is that's the year that the

11:02.628 --> 11:31.774
university of texas was hoping to go to the Rose 
Bowl. No, no, no, no, it was the, that was in 39 that

11:34.604 --> 11:41.551
A&M was, 41, 40 when A&M was going to the Rose Bowl. 
40, all right, then 41. 41, we won the conference,

11:43.073 --> 11:47.638
but we lost to Texas. Yes, yes. They beat us 
20-something to 27 to nothing there at Caulfield.

11:54.345 --> 11:55.466
And do you remember that game? No, because I didn't 
see that game. Oh, you were home? Yes. How,

11:59.851 --> 12:05.941
normally, particularly your first year, when did 
you go home, go back home first? That was the first

12:06.782 --> 12:08.364
time I went home. Okay. And how'd you get back and 
forth? I,

12:12.571 --> 12:26.533
I hitchhiked home, and the reason I went home was it 
was a four-day holiday. And in order to stay till

12:28.015 --> 12:35.203
the last minute at home, I went back on a train. The 
only time I think I ever went anywhere up there that

12:36.664 --> 12:52.421
wasn't hitchhiking or later on I had an old car that 
I had bought from working in Laredo. But I rode that

12:54.063 --> 12:56.385
train to

12:58.930 --> 13:00.272
Milano Junction. And then we had to get off the 
train and wait there in that

13:02.135 --> 13:10.167
old station. And then another train came through 
and you got on that and rode down into College

13:10.768 --> 13:17.057
Station. But other than that, I had

13:27.517 --> 13:37.273
Working in Laredo, I had saved up a little bit of 
money, and I'd boughten, boughten, I had bought a

13:27.517 --> 13:37.273
car. I'd paid, let's see, I think, I think I paid 92 
or 93 dollars for that. And what year was that?

13:49.353 --> 13:53.760
Well, this was in, this was in 40 or 41 that I bought 
it. And it was a 32 Ford. But I think

14:06.130 --> 14:13.359
I paid about $90, something like that. But you 
didn't bring it to the campus? No, not when I was a

14:15.361 --> 14:16.663
freshman. I took it up there later as a sophomore. 
And I didn't have it too long. I mean, we had one of

14:28.651 --> 14:43.562
those

14:28.651 --> 14:43.562
freezes come through where we were playing 
football, touch football that afternoon in

14:28.651 --> 14:43.562
shorts. And that night one of those blue norther 
came in and I had no antifreeze or anything in that

14:46.880 --> 15:00.374
thing and the next morning when I went out I mean 
there was rivulets of ice where the head had broken

14:46.880 --> 15:00.374
on that. Anyway, I think I got about $20 for that 
thing salvaged. But anyway, I got a big kick out of

15:07.162 --> 15:10.305
that having that car because Buck was running, 
Buck Weiris was running Aggieland that year. As a

15:17.792 --> 15:24.402
freshman, Curly Bryant was the head of the 
Aggieland Orchestra and Buck played the drums in

15:17.792 --> 15:24.402
it. But as a sophomore, Buck was heading it up and I 
went two or three different places with him on and

15:39.074 --> 15:53.130
they'd have a date to play, and I'd take about four 
of them in my car, and they'd pay the gasoline and my

15:39.074 --> 15:53.130
meals and get me into the dance free, you know, and 
so on and so forth. So I enjoyed that. Now, don't

15:54.772 --> 15:58.216
have any information about the Aggieland 
Orchestra. You don't? So please describe it as

15:59.357 --> 16:02.100
much as you can. Oh, let me tell you, they were 
great. I'm telling you, they were really great.

16:07.226 --> 16:07.967
The... They had,

16:09.550 --> 16:20.501
well, and we had something to judge them by, too, 
because we had some great bands come to the campus.

16:21.422 --> 16:25.225
Jan Garber came, Jimmy Lunsford, Skinny Ennis.

16:27.928 --> 16:28.529
They were great. And we liked to get black bands 
down there for one reason mainly. They couldn't

16:36.637 --> 16:38.899
get any pickup musicians. Now, when Skinny Ennis 
came, you see, he'd stop in Dallas, he'd bring

16:40.145 --> 16:59.432
himself, and he had a trombone player that most 
people knew, and a couple of others, and he'd bring

16:40.145 --> 16:59.432
about four of his regular band. And then he'd stop 
in Dallas and get some pickup musicians and come on

17:00.113 --> 17:04.679
down, you see. But if you got a black band, they had 
to come pretty well intact. And Jimmy Lunsford had

17:12.022 --> 17:15.186
a great band at that time. If you remember the song 
Blues in the Night, well Lunsford had a record that

17:15.807 --> 17:30.647
had Blues in the Night on both sides of it, and he had 
the premier arrangement of that. But anyway,

17:30.667 --> 17:36.375
getting back to the Aggieland Orchestra, they had 
a piano man named Dinkle Webb. And one of our

17:41.873 --> 17:55.568
classmates,

17:41.873 --> 17:55.568
Murphy, Bill Murphy from Paris, Texas, played 
sax.

17:58.110 --> 18:01.654
Don Hackney from over at

18:04.250 --> 18:06.112
I can't think of the name of the town. Where's the 
Crown Colony Golf Course? Lufkin. He was, he's

18:10.377 --> 18:13.861
retired. He was head of Temple. Temple Industry. 
Yeah. And he played clarinet and was a heck of a

18:20.429 --> 18:23.773
clarinet player. And Buck played the drums. I 
can't remember. And they did what we would now call

18:32.578 --> 18:36.263
big band music. Oh, yes, yes. Yeah, they had about, 
it was about a 10-piece, 10 or 12-piece orchestra.

18:45.254 --> 18:49.260
And they played all around, or dances at different 
schools and everything. And at that time, there

18:49.900 --> 18:59.873
was a radio program that came on on Sunday nights 
out of New York. called the Fitch Bandwagon. And

19:03.207 --> 19:06.970
they had, they featured new bands and things like 
that. And they got the Aggieland Orchestra, paid

19:07.791 --> 19:14.657
their expenses and everything to come to New York 
and play on the Fitch Bandwagon. And they were

19:14.677 --> 19:15.337
great. And what did you all do that night? 
Listened. Just listened. Yeah, no, they was a,

19:21.843 --> 19:24.225
they were great. I wish, I wish Buck was living. 
Buck could tell you more stories about And they

19:29.384 --> 19:31.810
were all students. Oh, yes. And they got, for that 
era, they got a good bit of money. They would make a

19:37.686 --> 19:39.591
little bit of spending money? Yes. When you say 
good bit of money, you know... nothing today

19:45.837 --> 20:14.730
absolutely actually for the trip to new york they 
got their expenses that's all and but the the just

19:45.837 --> 20:14.730
think of the pride of that something like that 
where did they practice mostly i guess it's over in

19:45.837 --> 20:14.730
sebasa okay and did they have distinctive aggie 
band uniforms when they when they were the agulha

19:45.837 --> 20:14.730
they played the For the most part, they'd wear a 
tuxedo. Their tuxedos? Yeah. And their name was

20:20.839 --> 20:22.822
the Aggieland? The Aggieland Orchestra. As far as 
you know, when was it organized?

20:30.672 --> 20:31.993
Seems like there was a fella.

20:35.558 --> 20:39.363
The earliest one, to my knowledge, was a fella 
named Little John, I believe. And after him, I

20:40.244 --> 20:42.827
think, then was Curly Bryant, and then Buck. So, 
late 30s? I would guess that's probably right. It

20:51.614 --> 20:52.595
could have been... I'm really... Let's see. No, 
I'd say early to middle 30s. I'd say middle 30s. And

21:02.728 --> 21:04.611
then it ceases with the war. Let's say it was 
interrupted. Oh, did they recreate it? Yes.

21:11.359 --> 21:12.561
What's his name... And Joe Haney, after the war, 
and how long after the war, I don't know when they

21:14.009 --> 21:38.515
recreated the Aggieland, but they were, Joe Haney 
was bandmaster and he had a young gentleman under

21:39.322 --> 21:41.225
him named Brewster. Brewster. Nice, nice young 
man. Now, were all the members in your day, were all

21:45.932 --> 21:53.503
the members of the Aggieland Orchestra also in the 
Aggie marching band?

21:56.207 --> 21:56.908
I'm trying to think. No. No, they weren't because 
Buck was never in the band. That's what I thought.

22:06.903 --> 22:07.945
Murphy was. I don't think Deagle Webb was.

22:12.626 --> 22:14.088
I don't think Curly Bryant was. But there was no 
requirement one way or another. The Anglin was a

22:19.957 --> 22:23.923
separate entity unto itself. It had no... No 
faculty advisor? No, no, no. Absolutely nothing.

22:30.233 --> 22:33.257
We had a lot of things at A&M that had no... you know 
it was just the thing they did and everybody i i do

22:34.722 --> 22:48.664
have to say that

22:34.722 --> 22:48.664
there was an amazing amount of uh self-control on 
things like that. They were handled. I'm sorry to

22:54.030 --> 22:54.831
take. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just checking. 
Yeah. So how much more time we have? Because I've

23:00.200 --> 23:01.523
got the whole afternoon. The world then changed 
for your generation and mine on December 7th. Yes,

23:10.463 --> 23:11.024
sir. Describe as much as you can where you were, 
what happened that day and the next day for you and

23:11.184 --> 23:19.595
your friends. I was at the dormitory.

23:27.745 --> 23:34.754
For some reason, I don't know, most everybody 
liked to go to the movie on Sunday afternoon, and I

23:27.745 --> 23:34.754
was amongst them. However, for some reason this 
Sunday, whether they had something on that, I

23:40.147 --> 23:45.034
didn't like or whether it was too crowded or I don't 
know, but I didn't go. I was, I was there. And

23:48.699 --> 23:53.366
just taking it easy. And all of a sudden somebody 
stood running out and you heard somebody yelling

23:55.049 --> 24:08.989
out in the outside saying, we're at war, we're at 
war, we're at war. What in the hell's going on, you

24:09.745 --> 24:11.767
know? And I went down. Well, they had stopped the 
movie at Northgate and announced what had taken

24:13.389 --> 24:22.520
place. And at first, we didn't believe it, you 
know. But as

24:27.426 --> 24:37.879
far as every little thing that took place, 
everybody was talking at once. you know, already

24:38.753 --> 24:53.010
conjecting

24:38.753 --> 24:53.010
what was going to happen, whether they were going 
to take us into the service immediately or what we

24:38.753 --> 24:53.010
were going to do and all this kind of stuff. And

24:53.110 --> 25:05.925
I guess some of the sophomores decided that we 
better have a little drill or something, so they

24:53.110 --> 25:05.925
started marching us around a bit.

25:07.576 --> 25:11.841
It was just something, electricity in the air, 
that really never went away. Did the routine

25:13.483 --> 25:19.290
change in the dormitory and classes and drills 
pretty quickly? Not a whole lot, except people did

25:21.433 --> 25:31.765
take the military classes a little more seriously 
than they had prior to that. And everybody wanted

25:32.787 --> 25:36.351
to be be sure they got a contract. You're familiar 
with what I mean when I say got a contract, okay. And

25:44.494 --> 26:02.760
we, in fact, that sent a lot of us to, OCS probably 
kept a lot of boys from getting killed if you want to

25:44.494 --> 26:02.760
be perfectly frank about it, because when we, 
after we went into the service, We were brought

26:04.293 --> 26:13.788
back to campus, and then after we were there a 
certain time, they sent us all off to a basic

26:04.293 --> 26:13.788
training. Didn't have any OCS to send us to 
immediately after we finished basic training, so

26:15.711 --> 26:23.102
they sent us back to A&M. And then they started 
pulling us out a few at a time. And my group was sent

26:29.740 --> 26:34.485
back to Fort Sill. We were in artillery. Sent back 
to Fort Sill and assigned to the school troops. And

26:42.634 --> 26:50.162
they were going to take us out a few at a time into the 
Officer Candidate School. They only took one

26:50.182 --> 26:52.805
bunch out. And after that, they came in one day and 
says, Everybody put your A bag, your B bag, you're

27:00.976 --> 27:04.842
shipping out tomorrow at noon. So we thought we 
were just going to go across to the OCS area. And a

27:11.753 --> 27:14.858
lot of boys left radios and things like that. 
They'd come back and pick them up later. Well, they

27:17.382 --> 27:19.285
came back and picked us up. They took us to the train 
station and they sent us to Fort Benning, Georgia.

27:24.773 --> 27:27.237
And through an infantry basic, again, and then 
through infantry OCS and then shipped out from

27:27.638 --> 27:31.702
there. So all that delay of this thing, this thing 
and that delayed everybody being sent into actual

27:31.722 --> 27:44.796
action and probably saved a lot of us from being 
being killed. All right. When did you and your

27:46.998 --> 27:54.186
colleagues first leave the campus as a part of 
these changes? Your second year? Let's see. Yes.

28:02.376 --> 28:03.057
The 42-43 year. Yeah, that's right. All right. So 
during the spring of 1942, you're still taking

28:05.881 --> 28:12.891
freshman classes, but life is getting more 
serious. Right. Did some folks start going to

28:15.695 --> 28:19.340
church more regularly? You know...

28:24.727 --> 28:26.790
I didn't really notice. I

28:27.431 --> 28:46.498
usually went, I wasn't a regular attendee, but I 
went to the Methodist Church at Northgate, and I

28:27.431 --> 28:46.498
didn't notice a big increase, to tell you the 
truth. Describe the YMCA and what it represented

28:46.934 --> 28:54.164
in those days at A&M under Mr. Cashin. Well, the 
YMCA was

28:54.184 --> 29:10.025
with the exception of the pool room at Wardrop's 
down at Northgate upstairs over Wardrop's store.

29:11.527 --> 29:16.654
The YMCA was about it as far as recreation other 
than the They did have some handball courts down, I

29:17.393 --> 29:24.262
think about three or four courts down there behind 
the gym. And they had a two or three lane bowling

29:26.124 --> 29:47.232
alley in the basement of the Y, which if there 
wasn't a senior using it or a junior or a sophomore,

29:26.124 --> 29:47.232
which was never, you could use it. They did have a 
soda fountain there, and it was a nice area,

29:48.612 --> 29:58.242
really. That's where we'd always go to make 
telephone calls. That's where the pay phones

30:01.885 --> 30:04.287
were. Did you know Mr. Cashin? No, I didn't. Did you 
know either of the boys, Red or Jim? Red, yeah. I

30:15.218 --> 30:17.961
knew Red real well, but not at that time. I knew Red 
later on after,

30:20.890 --> 30:34.506
well, I guess Red had already started his... NFL 
officiating? I don't know if he was in the NFL yet,

30:35.347 --> 30:40.793
but he was officiating quite a bit. I had met Red 
through Pat Knight. Pat was, even though he was a

30:45.385 --> 30:58.279
bit younger than I, we were very close friends, and 
I met Red through him, and also, I was always very

30:45.385 --> 30:58.279
active in Laredo in the Border Olympics. I was head 
of that a couple of years, and Colonel Andy

30:58.299 --> 31:10.493
Anderson and I were good friends, and I would, I 
refereed at the, Colley Station relays a couple of

31:12.059 --> 31:14.593
years.
