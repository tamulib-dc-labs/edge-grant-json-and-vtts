00:01.752 --> 00:07.782
Chester Clark by Andrea Hall on November 25th at 
Gladewater, Texas concerning the Vietnam War. In

00:08.543 --> 00:15.875
the interest of accumulating knowledge about the 
war, I'm going to donate this tape to the Texas A&M

00:08.543 --> 00:15.875
Oral History Collection in the University 
Archives. Is that all right with you? What is your

00:18.719 --> 00:20.582
birth date and birthplace? What is your 
educational background?

00:41.273 --> 00:48.782
I took the courses at the University of Texas at 
Tyler, and at Kilgore Junior College and Tyler

00:41.273 --> 00:48.782
Junior College. And what is your bachelor's 
degree in? My bachelor's degree was in math and

00:51.585 --> 00:54.428
physics. And what is your master's degree in? My 
master's was math and statistics. I see. Okay, how

01:00.295 --> 01:02.698
and why did you join the military? When I went to 
East Texas State at the time, it was East Texas

01:04.299 --> 01:09.205
State Teachers College. And in those days, when 
you registered, everybody went to the

01:10.822 --> 01:14.725
auditorium. And you got in the line. You found your 
letter above a line. You got in that line and stood

01:19.550 --> 01:23.053
in it until you got up to the front of the table. Then 
some counselor guided you in what you would take.

01:26.516 --> 01:28.698
And I had a good academic record of high school. So 
my counselor advised me to take several one-hour

01:29.278 --> 01:35.664
courses so I'd have more hours. And one of the 
one-hour courses she said take was ROTC. And at the

01:40.505 --> 01:47.835
time, I wasn't sure what an ROTC was, but I took 
ROTC. It was a one-hour course. And I found that at

01:50.999 --> 01:57.167
the beginning of my junior year, they would pay me 
to stay in ROTC. And at that time, it was a... You

02:01.531 --> 02:04.815
wore your uniform one time a week, which was kind of 
neat. And as I went along in the course, I learned

02:05.516 --> 02:12.083
more and more about the military and how it 
functioned and enjoyed the course. And at the end

02:13.325 --> 02:16.128
of my junior year, we took a physical. And a lot of 
people did not pass physical. I passed it with the

02:18.931 --> 02:24.838
qualifications to be a pilot, which again was kind 
of neat. So I stayed in ROTC, and at the end of when I

02:25.493 --> 02:31.580
graduated, I received a commission in the Air 
Force. Had it not been for my counselor, Mrs.

02:31.600 --> 02:36.225
O'Neil, I would probably have been in the 
military. Wow, what a story. Could you give me a

02:39.809 --> 02:42.492
brief sketch of your military career? Yes, I went 
into pilot training, and my basic pilot training

02:43.093 --> 02:51.062
was all in Texas at McAllen Air Force Base in 
McAllen, Texas, in the far south part of Texas.

02:55.853 --> 03:06.087
Then I went to my basic training at Lubbock, Texas, 
and went through old airplanes like the T-29 and

02:55.853 --> 03:06.087
the B-25. The B-25 being the bomber that was used in 
World War II. We were the last class to go through

03:12.175 --> 03:14.198
B-25s. The next class went into the T-33s, which is 
jet trainer.

03:21.907 --> 03:30.199
I went to my first flying base was at Savannah, 
Georgia, Hunter Air Force Base, and I was flying

03:21.907 --> 03:30.199
KC-97s. That's a refueling plane, the one that 
carries the fuel that we refueled B-52s and B-47s

03:30.640 --> 03:38.973
and fighters.

03:42.478 --> 03:51.171
Throughout my military career, I flew the whole 
time, flying the KC-97 for eight years until I went

03:42.478 --> 03:51.171
back to A&M to get my master's, and then flying 
C-123s in Vietnam. And then after Vietnam, I flew a

03:54.976 --> 03:58.940
similar airplane at the Pentagon, a T-29. OK. Now, 
what is your rank or was your rank? At the time I was

04:06.188 --> 04:09.091
in Vietnam, my rank was captain. I retired in 1978 
as lieutenant colonel. Right. And what was the

04:13.576 --> 04:19.082
date and place of your tour in Vietnam or any other 
tours that you served? Well, I was in the Air Force,

04:20.176 --> 04:30.419
the part of the Air Force called Strategic Air 
Command, and we had limited short tours at a lot of

04:20.176 --> 04:30.419
places. And before going to Vietnam, I had been 
stationed in Georgia, in Massachusetts, at Otis

04:30.439 --> 04:39.298
Air Force Base on Cape Cod. And during those 
periods of times, I had short tours in Greenland

04:39.700 --> 04:51.297
and Iceland and England and Scotland and other 
places where we spent like 17 days. So it wasn't

04:51.518 --> 04:55.364
like a long tour like Vietnam. And right after I got 
my master's at A&M, I graduated in August of 66 and

04:55.384 --> 05:07.682
received my orders to go to Southeast Asia and to 
survival school. And other training took me up to

05:08.455 --> 05:11.258
February of 67. I actually arrived in country the 
2nd of February, 1967, and spent almost 12 and a

05:11.799 --> 05:19.747
half months in Vietnam. Okay. And what would you 
describe your job or service in Vietnam as? I had

05:24.973 --> 05:26.374
actually a split tour. I was in Saigon at Thompson 
Air Force Base for six months serving as a wing

05:26.394 --> 05:33.822
safety officer. I did not have the qualifications 
to be a safety officer, but I was trained on site and

05:34.342 --> 05:46.941
served as a safety officer up until the time that my 
actual boss left country. And then I could not take

05:47.542 --> 05:49.565
his place. And when the people came in to take his 
place, they also brought one in to take my place. So

05:54.293 --> 05:58.459
I spent six months at Tan Sanut flying with the 19th 
Air Commando squadron and serving as the 315th Air

05:58.945 --> 06:09.375
Command Wing safety officer and then I was 
transferred to Fan Rang where I flew the same

05:58.945 --> 06:09.375
airplane but as an aircraft commander. Alright, 
now how were you or your unit involved in fighting?

06:16.101 --> 06:23.288
We were, the C-123 was a cargo airplane and we 
hauled everything in Vietnam. We hauled

06:23.308 --> 06:28.733
vegetables, we hauled ammo, we hauled People, we 
hauled families, we hauled families, their

06:29.168 --> 06:35.695
belongings, whatever needed to be transported, 
we transported. We were unarmed. There was no

06:38.038 --> 06:39.980
weaponry on the airplane itself. And every time 
that we were flying to a field, and when I say field,

06:40.601 --> 06:49.070
I don't mean two miles of concrete. I mean a field. 
The C-123 was assigned to land on dirt. And we

06:54.256 --> 06:56.138
landed at a lot of dirt strips. And the 123 was an 
airplane designed to land right at stall speed,

06:56.506 --> 07:06.298
which means that you'd make a very, very steep 
approach into the place that you were landing at a

06:56.506 --> 07:06.298
very, very low rate of speed. So when you hit the 
ground, you kill the throttles and stopped almost

07:06.338 --> 07:10.864
immediately. Well, flying at a very, very low rate 
of speed meant that you were very subject to being

07:11.565 --> 07:16.071
shot at. And we took a lot of hits that were towards 
the back of the airplane.

07:23.962 --> 07:51.893
that that was the if you talk about combat for 
shooting that was the combat now we did fly in a lot

07:23.962 --> 07:51.893
of areas where you know shells were being lobbed in 
and shots were going out we were in that kind of

07:23.962 --> 07:51.893
combat but we were not the we were not the fighters 
if you will we were involved in what other people

07:23.962 --> 07:51.893
were doing around us all right now we already 
talked a little bit about your training before you

07:23.962 --> 07:51.893
went to vietnam do you feel like you were 
adequately trained to go to vietnam For the job I

07:52.261 --> 07:54.784
did, yes. Now, I wasn't trained to be a safety 
officer, but I didn't know I was going to be a safety

07:55.144 --> 08:02.052
officer until I got there, and they didn't know I 
was either, so that doesn't count. But for the

08:02.713 --> 08:14.246
flying I was doing, my training was in Florida at 
Herbert Field, and I trained with Vietnamese as

08:02.713 --> 08:14.246
well as with instructors who had been to Vietnam. 
The problems that we had were not problems that you

08:14.766 --> 08:19.872
would even think about. The airplane itself had 
flying characteristics that didn't lend itself

08:20.240 --> 08:25.067
to a short person. The Vietnamese were short 
people. So we were trained to fly with, to handle

08:28.232 --> 08:37.505
those kinds of characteristics that people might 
have. For instance, we were not only carrying

08:37.525 --> 08:43.874
cargo, we were also a drop plane where people 
bailed out of the plane. And in several of the drops

08:43.894 --> 08:49.943
that we made, the Vietnamese were not heavy enough 
to make their parachutes go where they wanted them

08:43.894 --> 08:49.943
to. So we had to learn that if you were dropping 
Vietnamese, you had to drop them at a different

08:50.632 --> 08:59.343
point than you would drop in America. Because they 
would float so far. And later on, I will tell you

09:01.966 --> 09:07.173
about dropping some Vietnamese into the bay at Cam 
Ranh Bay. We actually dropped them in the water.

09:09.455 --> 09:13.380
And they continued to drift beyond where we 
planned to drop them. All right. How did you

09:15.563 --> 09:18.867
perceive military leadership in Vietnam? When 
you think about leadership, and you can think

09:19.960 --> 09:32.453
about the president or the commanders or 
whatever, but the leadership that I was most

09:19.960 --> 09:32.453
familiar with that I can really address is my 
immediate leadership. I was not really affected

09:33.134 --> 09:41.303
by the decisions being made by the army 
commanders. My job was based on flying supplies

09:42.785 --> 09:47.790
where they were needed in Vietnam. And that need 
was, it was like, you know when you get up in the

09:48.074 --> 09:54.582
morning, there's certain things you do to get 
ready to go outside. Well, our job in Vietnam for

09:55.143 --> 09:58.287
flying supplies was well known. You just, you're 
only, all I had to know was, where are they and where

09:58.828 --> 10:03.193
do they go? So my orders were, could have been given 
by anyone because the need was there and we saw it.

10:10.823 --> 10:17.912
And we flew anything from bob wire, which was 
served as a constant wire around the camp, to

10:10.823 --> 10:17.912
stakes to hold it down, to

10:18.179 --> 10:30.182
vegetables for the food for the people, because 
that's a tough thing to get in country.

10:31.344 --> 10:39.900
We had other missions that involved doing things 
like even flying bodies back to Saigon where the

10:31.344 --> 10:39.900
mortuary was. So it was a very, you did what needed 
to be done. It encompassed many things. Without

10:45.081 --> 10:48.346
someone having to say, today you will. Okay. 
During your tour, did you encounter any drugs

10:50.489 --> 10:56.639
within your unit or among fellow servicemen? No 
drugs like you mean drugs. But the drug that we

10:59.504 --> 11:01.888
encountered the most was alcohol. And the problem 
that I personally had, I was a captain. I had been in

11:10.278 --> 11:14.523
the Air Force 12 years at the time. I had a good 
flying record. And from the write-ups that I had,

11:19.009 --> 11:26.779
that I can look back now, and from remembering what 
I did, I was very proud of my ability to fly the

11:19.009 --> 11:26.779
airplane. A lot of people, and as I got older and 
still flew, I realized how my limitations were

11:28.801 --> 11:37.451
creeping up on me, how my reflexes were not as fast. 
I could not do things as quickly. And some of the

11:39.934 --> 11:45.301
people that we had in Vietnam were sent straight 
from a desk to Vietnam to fly. These were

11:45.901 --> 11:57.255
lieutenant colonels that had served in combat, 
had good records, but suddenly were thrown into

11:45.901 --> 11:57.255
another combat situation that they didn't want to 
be in. that they, it's not that they didn't want to

11:57.910 --> 12:02.535
be in Vietnam, they didn't want to be in a combat 
situation. They did not object to going to

12:02.615 --> 12:04.878
Vietnam. But once they were there, they knew they 
couldn't perform like they could in the past, or

12:04.898 --> 12:15.270
like we were, like the younger people were 
performing. And they turned to alcohol. And quite

12:17.313 --> 12:25.422
often, someone, in order to get there, to be ready 
to fly, they would have to drink the night before to

12:17.313 --> 12:25.422
be ready to fly the next morning. And that didn't, 
That bothered me because there were people who

12:28.285 --> 12:35.097
were not drinkers before they arrived in Vietnam 
who were alcoholics when they left. During your

12:37.421 --> 12:42.009
tour, did you encounter many people who were 
trying to capitalize on the war? The

12:42.069 --> 12:51.205
Americans that would, quote, capitalize on the 
war were... were ones who were taking advantage of

12:51.725 --> 12:56.070
something that they gave each of us to. And I did it 
myself. We could invest money in a savings account

12:57.712 --> 13:02.197
at, at the time, a 10% interest. Now, at the time, 
that was a good interest rate. It's nothing now,

13:06.763 --> 13:08.465
but it was then. And we had people that you could put 
in $10,000 into a savings account at 10% interest.

13:15.637 --> 13:17.239
But that was limited to $10,000. If you extended 
your tour of duty, you could invest another

13:17.800 --> 13:21.286
$10,000. So the people who were taking advantage 
of that, if you will, were single airmen or single

13:21.526 --> 13:31.661
enlisted that would continue their tour. I know 
that's not your question, but that is a way that

13:32.683 --> 13:38.011
people were, quote, taking advantage of the war. 
As for prolonging it for any personal gain, I

13:43.818 --> 13:50.149
didn't see anyone doing that, either Americans, 
Vietnamese.

13:50.209 --> 13:53.635
There was black market. There were things that 
happened that some supplies and things that we

13:54.276 --> 14:07.699
couldn't get, you could buy on the black market, 
which kind of makes you feel like we're here. We're

14:08.084 --> 14:10.149
here, quote, fighting for these people. Why don't 
they just give it back and let us have it? And an item

14:12.476 --> 14:23.224
such as sunglasses, you couldn't get it through 
the regular PX or through the base supply, but you

14:12.476 --> 14:23.224
could out on the black market at downtown Saigon 
and buy a pair. three or four or five times as much

14:24.419 --> 14:28.547
for them as they would from the PX. But electronic 
gear. Now, in the middle of a conflict, in the

14:32.134 --> 14:43.197
middle of a war, in the middle of a place where 
people were dying, it seemed stupid to think that a

14:32.134 --> 14:43.197
tape recorder or a tape deck or speakers would be a 
big item. But they were. These things were black

14:44.119 --> 14:46.343
market items. And some of the stories that were 
told that when the PX equipment would arrive at the

14:46.323 --> 14:59.710
base, most of it would be siphoned off and go 
downtown before it ever reached the base. I didn't

15:00.251 --> 15:01.132
see that happen. I was not in a position to see that 
happen. I did see American goods and military gear

15:03.357 --> 15:08.567
downtown for sale. I don't know how it got there, 
but it got there. Someone did profit from this, as

15:12.137 --> 15:25.631
we know from some of the people later on, some of the 
supply sergeants who later on were caught and

15:12.137 --> 15:25.631
prosecuted for dealing in the black market. Do you 
think Vietnam escalated careerism among

15:25.651 --> 15:29.535
officers? Not per se. It did help you in your 
career. And for me, the first thing that helped me

15:38.804 --> 15:53.603
in my career, as a lieutenant going through pilot 
training, the first rank that you would make after

15:38.804 --> 15:53.603
first lieutenant would be captain, and normally 
captain was in seven years. I made captain in five

15:55.206 --> 15:58.290
and a half years because they changed the rules. 
That was a career move for me, per se. An Army major

16:01.282 --> 16:04.065
was made in about 17 years. I made a major in less 
than 12 years because that was how they changed it.

16:11.272 --> 16:17.418
Now, I became a regular officer because at the time 
they were promoting to regular officer. It wasn't

16:17.879 --> 16:18.719
a promotion. Being a reserve officer, regular 
officer meant different things to you. Mine meant

16:22.703 --> 16:29.230
that I could retire 20 years with full benefits, if 
you will.

16:30.728 --> 16:38.799
When I made captain and then made regular officer, 
the criteria that was looked at was your

16:30.728 --> 16:38.799
educational background. I had the educational 
background that they were looking for at the time.

16:44.828 --> 16:47.031
It didn't matter that it was in math and physics. It 
mattered that I had it because people with the

16:47.732 --> 16:54.762
music background, with veterinarian 
backgrounds, with whatever background, made it

16:47.732 --> 16:54.762
because of the education. When I made major, they 
were looking at an educational level, which was a

16:55.484 --> 17:01.452
master's, and they were looking at Vietnam 
experience. I had both, so I made major. It's not

17:04.796 --> 17:10.704
that I went to Vietnam to help my career, but by 
being in Vietnam, it helped. And then I had a

17:12.166 --> 17:16.291
Pentagon tour, which helped me to make Lieutenant 
Colonel. So the promotions were, I didn't do those

17:17.052 --> 17:24.102
things to make the promotions, but the promotions 
were helped by them. And Vietnam helped. did help

17:25.454 --> 17:27.916
commanders make decisions. Who would receive 
different ranks. When you were in Vietnam, did you

17:33.001 --> 17:35.784
know who the enemy were? I did, and it was very 
difficult sometimes to accept the fact that as a

17:37.326 --> 17:54.162
Vietnamese living in Vietnam, some of the 
farmers, merchants, ranchers, wherever were

17:37.326 --> 17:54.162
there, they really didn't care who was in control 
of them. They just knew that if the Americans were,

17:56.425 --> 18:01.673
then they kept all their money that they made. They 
kept all their crops. They knew if the North

18:03.255 --> 18:08.823
Vietnamese were, then they gave up their money. 
They gave up their crops. But they kept their life.

18:11.768 --> 18:13.230
They lived either way. They'd get along with you if 
you invade today. They'd get along with me if I'd

18:15.333 --> 18:17.756
run you out today.

18:21.742 --> 18:23.625
Sometimes the farmers would... would take sides, 
if you will. And when one particular mission we

18:26.345 --> 18:34.775
were flying, we flew over a pretty green valley in a 
little stream. And it was a farmer out plowing his

18:34.935 --> 18:36.757
field. And we stayed low on purpose, which you 
normally didn't do. And we stayed low on purpose.

18:42.904 --> 18:49.292
As we flew over, the farmer, he waved, we waved, and 
then we made a circle and came back. And he dropped

18:50.167 --> 19:07.365
his plow and ran over to the tree and picked up a gun 
and shot at us as we made our next pass by, which the

18:50.167 --> 19:07.365
weapon he was using was like a .22, and the shell 
that came out of it was like a .22, but it wasn't a

18:50.167 --> 19:07.365
.22. It wasn't very accurate or precise. In fact, 
it was something that they looked like they had

19:10.155 --> 19:15.062
made themselves, like a ball that would be made for 
an old gun. But to us, it was kind of, I don't know how

19:15.883 --> 19:24.656
you take someone shooting at you, but we just 
cracked up laughing because here's this farmer.

19:24.676 --> 19:28.662
And we flew over one time, and I don't know if we 
disturbed him and flew the next time. But we were

19:29.030 --> 19:31.232
the enemy to him at that time. He was just outside of 
Benoit Air Force Base and was being protected by

19:31.953 --> 19:37.479
the military there. But we became the enemy to him 
then as we flew over. But as for being in an actual

19:42.525 --> 19:53.497
firefight and having to look at this one and say, 
oh, your eyes sloped this way, therefore you're a

19:42.525 --> 19:53.497
bad Vietnamese, or this way you're a good 
Vietnamese. If you had to pick out the enemy...

19:57.481 --> 19:59.364
from a lineup, you'd never pick it out. I don't mean 
to say that all Chinamen are laundry people, but

20:00.546 --> 20:06.475
the Vietnamese did look the same. They could be a 
communist today and non-communist tomorrow,

20:07.296 --> 20:14.207
depending on who was in power. Could you tell me 
about the time you stayed in the hotel that was run

20:16.290 --> 20:22.560
by the Viet Cong? My first place I stayed in Saigon 
was in a hotel. And it was all military in the hotel.

20:31.454 --> 20:36.724
And my first week in country, I bought a camera like 
everybody buys a camera. And we, was being

20:37.625 --> 20:41.713
martyred one night. And when the base is being 
mortared, they put up flares. And they have Puff

20:47.158 --> 20:50.887
the Magic Dragon was a C-47. It had a machine gun 
mounted inside of it. And they would put up flares

20:54.552 --> 20:57.815
that would illuminate the area. And the C-47s 
would fire. Every third bullet would be a tracer

21:01.098 --> 21:03.981
that you could see. So the mortars were coming in 
this way. The flares were being put up. And the

21:07.985 --> 21:11.809
C-47s would fly in a tight circle and shoot in an 
area. It would look like a Christmas tree, the way

21:11.949 --> 21:17.194
the tracer shells were showing up in every third 
one. I was on top of my building taking pictures. of

21:20.962 --> 21:26.550
this, and the kid that was with me, my roommate, was 
Joe Driscoll. And Joe and I got very tickled at

21:26.570 --> 21:28.253
this. Here we are in the middle of a combat zone, 
taking pictures of the base that we're stationed

21:28.273 --> 21:35.203
at being mortared by, quote, the enemy. And we're 
up there taking pictures of it and thinking how

21:35.804 --> 21:38.508
pretty it is. Well, the hotel we were in was right 
next to an army barracks. And in one of the times

21:45.018 --> 21:50.226
just before I left Saigon, There was a hit on Saigon 
itself. There was a hit on the embassy, on the army

21:53.686 --> 21:58.190
barracks, and on several places around us. But our 
hotel never was hit. And our motorcycles stayed

22:01.713 --> 22:05.496
down on the porch and were never stolen, never 
touched. And we found out later on that our

22:06.277 --> 22:18.728
landlord got on the motel, paid off the Viet Cong, 
and was indeed part, you know, he had allegiance to

22:06.277 --> 22:18.728
whoever was in power at the time. And he paid off the 
Viet Cong. His hotel was never hit our whole time

22:21.793 --> 22:24.295
there. It's very interesting. What honors have 
you, what military honors have you received? In

22:32.122 --> 22:38.348
Vietnam, I received the Vietnamese Service Medal 
and the Vietnamese Combat Medal. I received air

22:39.069 --> 22:41.111
medals for my flying. And for one particular 
mission that we flew on Easter Sunday, I received a

22:41.892 --> 22:47.517
distinguished flying cross. All right, can you 
explain to me what each of these honors means? The

22:54.003 --> 23:00.512
Vietnamese combat and Vietnamese service medals 
are like our national service defense medal. If

23:00.613 --> 23:03.957
you served in the military in the country, you 
received those medals. The air medal was reserved

23:04.899 --> 23:16.034
for pilots, Air Force pilots who flew a certain 
number of missions or certain types of missions in

23:04.899 --> 23:16.034
country. And the missions that just before I 
arrived in Vietnam, for each mission that a pilot

23:18.918 --> 23:27.569
flew, each time he took off and landed counted as a 
mission. And for 35 missions, a pilot would

23:27.589 --> 23:32.334
receive an air medal. They changed this to be 35 
days of flying, a mission being from that morning

23:32.354 --> 23:43.488
till that night, rather than 35 missions. Because 
in some of the missions that we would fly, you would

23:47.234 --> 23:53.359
fly like a 20-minute hop from one place to another, 
and you'd fly that all day long. And on one

23:53.379 --> 24:02.047
particular day, you might fly 35 or 40 of those hops 
back and forth, back and forth, which would have

23:53.379 --> 24:02.047
meant an air medal. So some people were leaving 
country as I arrived with 10 and 12 and 14 and 15 air

24:02.067 --> 24:08.293
medals. When I changed it to 35 days, that meant 
that in a year's time, you were going to get and

24:16.900 --> 24:18.522
maybe four or five air medals. So an air medal was 
for flying a particular kind of mission. The

24:22.746 --> 24:27.871
Distinguished Flying Cross was for a mission 
above and beyond the call of duty. And our

24:27.951 --> 24:35.439
particular mission was a very, it started off as 
just like any other mission. It was a normal type

24:35.479 --> 24:41.825
mission, but escalated into a lot different than 
what we thought. We were flying at a place called

24:42.366 --> 24:44.308
Zomcat, And it was fairly safe in the morning. We 
were flying in the morning. We had helicopter

24:47.822 --> 24:50.807
gunships for protection. But as the day wore on, we 
were evacuating the Vietnamese, the Americans,

24:52.790 --> 25:05.690
and the

24:52.790 --> 25:05.690
mountain yards out of this particular village. 
And it was a village associated with a base. It was

25:08.955 --> 25:11.899
about to be overrun by the VC. The gunships were 
holding the VC at bay while we took the people out.

25:17.987 --> 25:20.494
We kept loading the airplane up to its maximum and 
taking them out. The gunships were overextended

25:21.376 --> 25:27.272
and ran out of fuel and had to return home. 
replacement gunships were diverted somewhere

25:27.961 --> 25:53.901
else for a more serious mission so we were flying in 
unarmed to haul these people out and on the last

25:27.961 --> 25:53.901
three missions we were actually surrounded by the 
vc and we're taking hits as we're taking them out

25:27.961 --> 25:53.901
they're being held off by gunfire from within the 
perimeter as we were hauling them out and we put the

25:27.961 --> 25:53.901
last people on board and when you fly an airplane 
there's a limit to the amount of weight you put on

25:54.488 --> 25:57.152
the airplane. It's called the design gross 
weight. When you exceed the design gross weight,

25:59.836 --> 26:03.882
then the airplane becomes rock and doesn't fly. 
Well, the last mission we knew we had very little

26:04.824 --> 26:10.112
time, and we could not make any more runs in. 
Because the last four, as we were coming in, you

26:11.134 --> 26:19.086
could watch the perimeter of the base being closed 
in on. And we could see how far out the people were.

26:23.885 --> 26:29.011
And they were right up on the, within a couple 
hundred yards of the base on our last mission. So we

26:29.451 --> 26:32.294
put everybody on the airplane. Everybody. And it 
was kind of interesting. In the middle of all this,

26:34.937 --> 26:40.043
the Americans, it was almost like integration. 
The Americans got on the front part of the

26:40.243 --> 26:42.686
airplane. The Vietnamese were in the middle part. 
Then the Cambodians in the mountain yards were in

26:47.812 --> 26:50.875
the back. They sat in the back of the bus. And the 
cargo compartment of C-123 closes with a ramp that

26:53.804 --> 27:05.398
comes up from the ground, and then a ramp that comes 
down from inside the airplane, and they meet. But

27:06.139 --> 27:10.704
we had people on the ramp that goes out of the plane, 
and we brought it up. They were actually at an angle

27:10.724 --> 27:14.168
in the back of the plane where that loaded. And we 
took off. The dirt strip we were taking off from was

27:16.431 --> 27:20.996
not really long enough to take off from. And as we 
took off, we barely cleared the treetops to get

27:23.521 --> 27:25.404
out. And as we took off and circled back, the VC 
actually infiltrated where we were and they had

27:26.486 --> 27:40.868
set explosives to blow up the communications 
equipment and the artillery they had to leave

27:26.486 --> 27:40.868
behind. They actually infiltrated as we were 
pulling out and the things were it was I took there I

27:44.142 --> 28:05.323
was typically American I was taking pictures 
because this was blowing up and it was it was it was

27:44.142 --> 28:05.323
it was interesting the last probably all 
afternoon all the missions we flew in were based on

27:44.142 --> 28:05.323
this in fact one time one time they ran out of 
ammunition So we changed, we diverted from going

28:05.928 --> 28:14.738
straight back and picked up ammo and took it in so 
they'd have the ammo to withstand the onslaught in

28:05.928 --> 28:14.738
the afternoon.

28:17.861 --> 28:20.885
What other operations were you involved in that 
were successes?

28:23.327 --> 28:32.998
Well, there were some that were more important 
than others, but probably not more important in

28:23.327 --> 28:32.998
the end result. One of the missions that I remember 
that was a super success was on Christmas Day. We

28:39.970 --> 28:45.936
had been flying, I flew with the Special Forces 
most of my, the time I was in country. I started with

28:46.957 --> 28:51.803
them because in Saigon as a safety officer, I would 
fly on the weekends. And there we had weekends as

28:52.403 --> 28:54.826
well as weekdays. I would fly on the weekends to 
give other people weekends off. And when I started

28:58.848 --> 29:05.478
flying with these people, they were a special 
brand of folks, special forces. And one thing that

29:06.239 --> 29:14.831
they were talking about was that they really 
wanted for Christmas, they wanted some beer and

29:06.239 --> 29:14.831
Playboy magazines. So on Christmas Day, one of the 
missions that we flew was to fly over and drop to

29:15.793 --> 29:22.062
them beer and Playboy magazines. Super 
successful mission. The other missions, some of

29:24.245 --> 29:33.529
them, one of the most satisfying missions I had was 
one when I really, I was flying out of

29:37.694 --> 29:39.518
That's terrible. I can't remember the name of the 
base we were flying out of. Anyway, we were flying

29:41.482 --> 29:56.715
out of one of the northern bases that was a big 
supply base, and we were flying into the various

29:41.482 --> 29:56.715
sundry special forces areas, and we flew into one 
with the cargo that we were told to take to them. And

29:56.695 --> 30:01.200
the cargo we took to them was steel spikes to hold 
down the concertina wire. And we landed, and we

30:01.740 --> 30:07.707
offloaded, and we were expecting them to come out 
and say, great, we really need this. And the first

30:08.187 --> 30:11.350
thing we heard was, why the hell did you bring this? 
We have, look. And you look over there, and there's

30:12.552 --> 30:16.035
just mounds of steel spikes. And I said, well, the 
frag order says steel spikes. Bring it in. They

30:20.500 --> 30:21.941
said, we don't want the steel spikes. Bring us 
ammo. We were hit last night. Half the ammo was wet.

30:25.860 --> 30:26.548
It didn't fire. We need ammo. So I went back to the 
supply point, and I told the people there, I said, I

30:28.083 --> 30:33.609
don't want to take those. I want to take ammo. And 
they said, you can't. This is what it says you take,

30:37.514 --> 30:39.356
and it's what you take. I said, no, that's not how it 
works. The commander needs ammo. He needs it now.

30:45.062 --> 30:46.524
He doesn't need to charge. Well, you have to talk to 
the major in charge. I remember I was the captain at

30:48.806 --> 30:50.048
the time. So I talked to the major in charge, and he 
says, Captain, you'll take what we tell you to

30:51.149 --> 30:54.753
take. I said, no, sir. We won't. And at the time, 
since I had been on the wing staff in Saigon, I knew

30:59.074 --> 31:06.204
the commander, and he knew me. And I called him, and 
I said, General Brown, I'm not having a problem.

31:09.989 --> 31:11.051
And I told him what the problem was. And he said, let 
me talk to the major. And of course, the major was

31:13.274 --> 31:17.400
very upset that the captain said, I'll take this 
cargo and not this. It was very satisfying to fly

31:18.000 --> 31:20.584
into that base with ammo. and offload ammo and see 
these guys say, we couldn't have stayed last

31:20.800 --> 31:26.882
another night without it. We appreciate your 
bringing what we need.
