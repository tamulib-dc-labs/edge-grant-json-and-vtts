WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:04.701
I think it's good now, but I don't know exactly. 
Just a moment. Because this machine is something

00:07.605 --> 00:13.574
that... well, I don't like machines.

00:16.819 --> 00:20.925
Well, first of all, what's your name? My name is 
Rafael San Miguel. And where were you born? In

00:25.872 --> 00:29.277
Guerrero, Tamaulipas. And when did you leave? de 
Tamaulipas? 913, 1913. Un momentito.

00:42.181 --> 00:47.569
Y ahora para... Bueno, la historia de su vida. En 
las primeras... ¿En qué año nació usted? Nací en

00:54.258 --> 00:59.284
1900.

00:59.304 --> 00:59.745
1900. En enero... And January? January 26. And I 
chose the century...

01:09.179 --> 01:09.539
Yes. ...for the end. Don't fight to know how many 
years you have, because there you go. It's the same

01:14.766 --> 01:16.669
with the century. Yes. Well, and... My father 
was... ...the

01:16.849 --> 01:27.683
superintendent of schools. in the northern 
district of Tamaulipas. Yes. Until 1913, when the

01:34.490 --> 01:39.216
revolution ended the schools. Yes. Since then, 
we've come to live here in Zapata.

01:51.011 --> 01:55.157
In those days, Zapata was the head of the county. 
Zapata was a town inferior to San Ignacio. San

01:59.386 --> 02:04.412
Ignacio, the town that is there, is a few miles 
away. Yes. It was a bigger town. It had more trade,

02:05.894 --> 02:12.083
it had more money, it had more population. Yes. But 
the head of the county was Zapata, and there was La

02:13.084 --> 02:20.895
Casa de Cortes. The smallest town. It was a little 
smaller than... Naturally, Toda esa gente que

02:26.523 --> 02:33.072
vino de Guerrero, muchos nos quedamos en Zapata y 
entonces Zapata se fue. Creció la población. La

02:39.281 --> 02:51.799
vida que se llevaba en esos días era una vida

02:39.281 --> 02:51.799
muy quieta, muy tranquila. No había en qué 
divertirse ni en qué pasearse.

02:57.691 --> 03:08.326
And in Guerrero, before the revolution, what kind 
of life was there? Guerrero? Yes, Guerrero.

03:13.233 --> 03:20.543
Guerrero, his most flourishing period was before 
1900.

03:23.988 --> 03:26.652
Guerrero had a population of 10,000 or 12,000 
inhabitants. But when I met him, I was already

03:30.609 --> 03:36.476
going to work. What Floreciente Guerrero did was

03:36.496 --> 03:47.469
a project called the Free Zone. The government 
allowed to pass to European merchandise or

03:54.357 --> 04:06.555
merchandise from the United States to pass to the 
peoples of the border without paying rights. And

04:07.075 --> 04:12.924
then, when they left the people of Guerrero, they 
did charge rights. That's why all the peoples of

04:12.944 --> 04:18.652
the border were rich in trade. They had a lot of 
trade. At that same time, There was a railway

04:25.002 --> 04:28.766
project. Yes. From Nuevo Laredo to Matamoros. 
Yes. And those works came, they came to Guerrero

04:34.651 --> 04:38.475
and they went from Guerrero. They abandoned that 
project and then Guerrero started to go down. Then

04:48.765 --> 04:54.250
the revolution hit him the hardest blow of his 
life. Porque francamente,

04:55.411 --> 05:22.103
en Guerrero vivían gentes que tenían muchas 
propiedades aquí en el condado de Zapata y hasta en

04:55.411 --> 05:22.103
el condado de Webb y en el condado de gentes muy 
ricas que tenían grandes ranchos y todo el

04:55.411 --> 05:22.103
producto de esos ranchos iba a dar a Guerrero. Sí. 
Ahí vivían sus familias. All the money that was

05:26.782 --> 05:42.261
made in all those ranches here from Hebronville 
and all this region and here in part of Laredo, the

05:26.782 --> 05:42.261
owners of those ranches lived in Guerrero. The 
product of those ranches was going to Guerrero.

05:49.289 --> 05:54.696
And of course it was one of those very flourishing 
times. Then it turns out that the revolution came.

05:59.037 --> 06:04.103
Those rich people who lived in Guerrero came to 
live here in the United States. They stayed to live

06:04.183 --> 06:06.625
here. Here they could attend their better ranks 
and they didn't come back. And that's where the

06:11.571 --> 06:14.394
decline started faster. Yes. And your father, for 
what reason did he

06:15.455 --> 06:21.982
come here? Well, frankly, The only reason was 
that... I don't know why we were afraid of the

06:27.746 --> 06:33.233
revolution. Dad wasn't afraid, but... Guerrero 
came and we came too. Yes. Is there a lot of danger?

06:44.647 --> 06:45.008
No. No? No. What happened in Guerrero... El 7 de 
abril de 1913 entró

06:52.473 --> 07:14.507
una partida revolucionaria a Guerrero en la noche 
y tiraron unos cuantos tiros ahí y con eso fue

06:52.473 --> 07:14.507
suficiente para que se viniera todo Guerrero para 
acá. Luego nosotros nos venimos como el día 15 de

07:14.587 --> 07:18.733
abril. We were there in Guerrero for a week or a 
little more and we came back. Dad's profession,

07:24.523 --> 07:36.113
he couldn't visit schools anymore because there 
were no schools anymore. Yes, it's a problem.

07:37.194 --> 07:39.736
Because of the revolution. Yes, because of the 
revolution. And we had to make a new branch of life.

07:47.883 --> 07:48.163
A new life. In what way did you become warriors? 
What? In what way? On a boat or what? On a boat. On a

07:59.655 --> 08:00.596
boat. There was what you call a ferry boat right in 
front of us. And one would pass by and one would go to

08:08.286 --> 08:15.855
the other side. ¿Y tenía su papá tieres aquí en 
Texas? Papá no, más bien la familia de mamá. Ah, su

08:25.690 --> 08:28.153
mamá tenía tieres. Su papá tenía ya. Ya, pero antes 
de la Revolución no. Sí. ¿Antes? Antes de la

08:36.463 --> 08:38.025
Revolución. ¿Y después de la Revolución? La 
familia de mi mamá tenía propiedades aquí y papá

08:40.168 --> 08:46.956
tenía propiedades al otro lado. Yes. What is your 
father's name? His name is also Rafael San Miguel.

08:54.507 --> 08:55.388
And his mother? Pilar Cuellar de San Miguel. Pilar 
Cuellar. Cuellar. Yes. The family of Cuellar is

09:00.936 --> 09:06.603
very old in this part. And also of San Miguel. It's a 
very old family here. The one from Cuellar, yes.

09:15.491 --> 09:20.819
Let me show you the tree I have here. Okay. It's 
okay. No, it's okay. A Cuellar captain? From that

09:24.664 --> 09:25.525
family. All that family from Cuellar. I come from 
that family. Yes.

09:34.999 --> 09:37.863
Oh, yes. Not long ago. Yes. Well, I know that the 
Cuellar family comes from a captain. Yes.

09:43.822 --> 09:44.523
Spanish. Spanish? And your family, what is your 
name? My name is Cresencia Ramirez, my father's

09:49.131 --> 09:55.503
name is Ramirez. Ramirez. Ramirez. And is it also 
an old family from here? Yes. We also come from

09:59.891 --> 10:04.699
Spain because we come from a Ramirez, José Luis 
Ramirez, who was The ones that are not from Spain,

10:05.101 --> 10:10.748
the portions of land they have here. Ah, portions 
here in Vialtrán. The family of them, my family

10:13.972 --> 10:19.859
too. My daughter, in one of your books there are 
some portraits that Romero Flores gave me when we

10:19.879 --> 10:27.328
were a general for the first time.

10:34.396 --> 10:40.284
Este es el árbol de la familia Cuellar.

10:45.452 --> 10:55.747
El

10:45.452 --> 10:55.747
primer Cuellar que vino aquí a esta región se llamó 
Miguel Cuellar. Y la esposa se llamaba Gertrude.

10:59.632 --> 11:00.994
No, perdón. Before Miguel Cuellar came Bartolome 
Cuellar, who was the father of Miguel Cuellar.

11:08.832 --> 11:11.536
This Miguel Cuellar was the captain. And from 
Captain Cuellar came five children, among them a

11:12.137 --> 11:22.310
Domingo. And from that Domingo came a Fernando. 
And from that Fernando Jose Maria came. He was my

11:31.969 --> 11:33.090
grandfather. And from Jose Maria came my mother. 
And from here we come. This is the family. There are

11:39.878 --> 11:42.942
many generations. One, two, three, four, five. 
And from him, from Domingo. What's your name?

11:51.192 --> 11:51.532
Domingo. And from me, from Mary, from Jesus. Oh, 
you? Yes, I am also from Puebla. Oh, you are

11:59.378 --> 12:01.101
cousins. No, no. Distant. Very distant. Very 
distant. Yes, very distant. She is my aunt. No, but

12:11.157 --> 12:20.032
I want to tell you that we come from the same place, 
but already four or five generations away. Yes,

12:20.112 --> 12:20.593
yes, very far. We came from the same. And for the 
Ramírez, they ask me that I am Ramírez. And also, my

12:28.340 --> 12:36.511
great-great-grandfather, who knows what it 
would be, he was also one of those who donated the

12:28.340 --> 12:36.511
King of Spain. Yes. The same as them. And Captain 
Bartolomé Cuellar was also from Spain. Yes. In

12:45.723 --> 12:48.406
what year were they here? I don't know. Yo entiendo 
que el primer cuéllar que vino de España hacia el

12:49.868 --> 12:55.997
Tío was called Ascencio Cuellar. And from 
Ascencio Cuellar came a Bartolomé Cuellar, and

12:59.094 --> 13:11.910
from that Bartolomé Cuellar came that Miguel 
Cuellar. The generation is over, it's too far.

13:16.136 --> 13:17.918
Yes, it's too far. Maybe 200 or more years. In the 
San Miguel family,

13:25.863 --> 13:33.774
There was a Tomas San Miguel who came to Eagle Pass 
or to Piedras Negras. Yes, many years ago. I think

13:37.399 --> 13:49.796
he was a soldier of the Spanish Army who came to 
Mexico.

13:52.460 --> 13:54.182
And that Tomas San Miguel Pablo San Miguel came. 
When was it? Pablo San Miguel, 1701 or something

13:58.391 --> 14:02.776
like that.

14:05.258 --> 14:13.648
And

14:05.258 --> 14:13.648
from Pablo San Miguel came Ruperto San Miguel. He 
came from there to Guerrero. He stayed there in

14:16.591 --> 14:18.573
Guerrero. And from there, Ruperto San Miguel came 
here. Oh, and then you. Yes. And do you have

14:25.729 --> 14:29.332
children? No. No? No. My sister, we were two, my 
sister and I. My sister has a dozen, how many do you

14:39.261 --> 14:43.805
have? Eight. Eight? Eight. Do you have more than 
one? No, no, I also have a son, a son, who is 14 years

14:47.548 --> 14:53.213
old. 14. My son is with his father. My husband is now 
writing his thesis for the doctorate. And I have a

15:09.454 --> 15:16.043
lot of work and the son is with him to help him. with 
me to help him. This is from his father, Rafael San

15:19.472 --> 15:30.201
Miguel, who was the director of schools in 
Guerrero. No, in the state. In the state of

15:33.475 --> 15:38.064
Tamaulipas, but he lives in Guerrero. He lived in 
Guerrero. Yes. This is a God of ours who was named

15:43.876 --> 15:52.273
Fernando Cuellar, just like this Fernando 
Cuellar who is here. Fernando Cuellar. No, this is

15:56.892 --> 15:58.815
another tree. Ah, Cuellar. It's

16:00.758 --> 16:05.085
here. There was this Fernando Cuellar, and then 
came this other Fernando Cuellar.

16:16.562 --> 16:17.704
And where did he live? . . . . .

16:42.153 --> 16:47.019
Vivían en Guerrero antes de la Revolución, luego 
con la Revolución se unieron. Y no volvió. No

16:49.101 --> 16:53.526
volvió. No volvió. Bueno, si su papá tenía este 
trabajo con el Estado, ¿por qué vivía en Guerrero y

16:53.787 --> 17:10.506
no en Ciudad Victoria? Did he live in Mexico? Well, 
yes. In Mexico, yes. Who? Your father. He was there

17:19.906 --> 17:21.587
for a long time. No, but that was much later. When my 
father was a school inspector in the north

17:25.071 --> 17:35.740
district of Tamaulipas, Tamaulipas was divided 
into four school districts. The north, the

17:36.121 --> 17:40.965
center, and two in the south. Ah, I know. And dad 
visited the schools in the northern district.

17:46.949 --> 17:48.630
Yes. And it was from here, from Nuevo Larero to 
Matamoros, and then over there to San Fernando,

17:48.650 --> 17:59.041
over there, all of that. Yes. And we lived in 
Guerrero because that's where our family lived.

18:05.487 --> 18:06.548
Yes. It could have been better for him to have lived 
in Matamoros or Novolaredo.

18:15.535 --> 18:17.638
But since he already had his house... Yes, more 
family. And after coming here to Texas, to Zapata,

18:21.164 --> 18:32.082
what kind of work did your father have? My father, 
apart from being of being a teacher, a titular.

18:40.808 --> 18:40.969
Yes. It was... it was... what you call 
surveillance. Yes. And when we came here, dad was

18:48.337 --> 19:02.913
busy measuring land by different... and in that 
way, we made a new life. Then... Petroleum

19:05.725 --> 19:09.970
companies started to come to rent land. And my 
father started a company that rented land. And

19:16.056 --> 19:22.623
then that company became interested in renting 
land in Mexico. And the region of Mexico was better

19:22.643 --> 19:25.627
known by my father. The documentation of Mexico 
was better known by my father. And then he went to

19:30.933 --> 19:33.235
live in Mexico. Mexico City. In what year? They 
went to Mexico, the city of Mexico. Those lands

19:43.060 --> 19:46.445
were rented here in this region. But then,

19:48.228 --> 20:00.148
in the year 25, came the regulation of the oil law in 
Mexico. Yes. in the time of General Calles, who was

20:01.312 --> 20:08.321
the one who regulated the oil law. And all the 
companies had the need to have government

20:08.341 --> 20:23.541
concessions to exploit their lands. The lands 
that had been contracted before the year 17 had the

20:23.561 --> 20:31.251
right to a very advantageous type of concession. 
and those who had been hired between the 17th and

20:32.007 --> 20:39.979
the 25th had the right to another type of 
concession. The first one was preferential, the

20:41.001 --> 20:51.197
second one was confirmatory, and the second one 
was preferential. The first one was for life, it

20:52.443 --> 20:58.592
was given to the owner of the land. The second one 
was given to the company that had the contract for

20:58.693 --> 21:05.082
15 or 20 years. And after 15 or 20 years, the oil went 
to the hands of the government. For that reason, my

21:15.979 --> 21:21.167
father had to go and live in Mexico. Five or six 
years. He went to Mexico City. And you? No, I stayed

21:28.295 --> 21:29.417
here. He stayed here because he was the one who 
managed the bank. He was the one who managed the

21:37.372 --> 21:44.185
bank. The first banker in Zapata. Oh, the first 
banker? Yes. Yes? I was the first banker in Zapata,

21:52.055 --> 22:00.285
and I was the one who brought the first drinking 
water system to Zapata. The first waterworks.

22:01.647 --> 22:02.207
Also? Yes. And for that... It's over. Yes, the old 
Zapata waterworks were from... And then, my

22:13.493 --> 22:23.484
father was in Mexico until the year of 28, for 
example. Always the year of 34, right? Yes, that's

22:26.368 --> 22:26.968
right. 34, for example. The year of 34, he was still 
in Mexico. Well, where do you receive your

22:34.617 --> 22:40.564
education?

22:42.923 --> 22:48.255
In Guerrero.

22:48.375 --> 22:54.650
In

22:48.375 --> 22:54.650
Guerrero? Sí. Of course, your father was a teacher 
and tried to teach me a lot of things, but I never

22:56.035 --> 23:04.043
wanted to learn them. If I had learned half of what 
he wanted me to learn... He could have learned it

23:07.466 --> 23:12.011
because he had a teacher at home. Yes, but it's 
difficult. And I was preparing to go to Monterrey

23:17.777 --> 23:24.203
to a school. In Monterrey, when the regulations 
came out and there was no school anymore, there was

23:24.503 --> 23:31.996
only Venezuela. And it happened to many people the 
same way. From there to here, I studied at school in

23:34.921 --> 23:44.677
Zapata, I learned

23:34.921 --> 23:44.677
a little bit of English. Laredo also studied there 
for a year. But school, high school, well... It

23:50.930 --> 23:56.835
wasn't possible in those

23:50.930 --> 23:56.835
years. No, not for a long time. Yes. And your mother 
was already crying because she was going to

23:59.398 --> 24:07.845
school. Frankly, in those years there were 
aspirations for the school. For example,

24:14.992 --> 24:19.536
Guerrero, in a generation before mine, He

24:19.887 --> 24:33.687
produced two or three doctors and an engineer. Two 
lawyers.

24:38.374 --> 24:48.409
But then came the revolution and we said that we 
couldn't go to school because of the revolution. Y

24:48.710 --> 24:55.078
para esta generación la escuela fue muy difícil. 
Fue uno de los males que hizo la revolución. Porque

25:00.705 --> 25:12.760
muchos muchachos que estaban preparados para 
irse a Monterrey, a México, a Guadalajara, ya no

25:00.705 --> 25:12.760
pudieron porque el país estaba en guerra. Y la 
guerra estaba, pues, 10 años. Sí, 10 años de

25:17.660 --> 25:20.083
guerra. Así es que en 10 años, pues, se pasó todo el 
tiempo de estudiar. Sí. Se puso a trabajar. Este es

25:28.455 --> 25:35.625
una... Es el Palacio Municipal de Guerrero, nomás 
que no se ve todo. This was the first car I drove. In

25:41.274 --> 25:41.935
Guerrero. No, here in Zapata. Here in Zapata. It 
was a man's. Was it yours? No. No? Whose? It was a

25:48.703 --> 25:52.428
man's, Flores, who is here in this portrait. Over 
here in the back is the owner of the car. I'm not in

25:55.752 --> 25:56.994
this portrait. And this one here was a 
revolutionary general. Ah, on which side?

26:04.784 --> 26:05.865
General Castro. General Castro and, oh, yes, 
General Jesús Augustín Castro, who was in charge

26:06.082 --> 26:21.839
of the guerrilla cartel in Ciudad Guerrero, 
Tamaulipas. But Castro was general with who? With

26:26.765 --> 26:31.130
Carranza, with... Castro? With who? When that 
warrior came, he came with a carranza. With a

26:36.739 --> 26:37.721
carranza. I think this is the... No, this is the... 
Oh, they had already taken

26:37.741 --> 26:49.700
it off. This is the one that's back here, but it 
doesn't look like it. When the warrior sank, This

26:55.424 --> 26:57.669
is the church. And a boat inside the church. Yes. Is 
it possible to see this now? Yes. With boats. And

27:09.476 --> 27:13.585
it's fishing inside the church. La iglesia no se ha 
caído, creo. El palacio municipal, el hotel que

27:18.100 --> 27:23.948
estaba ahí, también se cayó. Se alcanza a ver muy 
poquito. El hotel aquí se ve un poquito. El hotel,

27:27.473 --> 27:30.297
ahí se hacían fiestas, bailes y todo. Tenía un 
salón muy bonito. Y este es después de Presa

27:32.780 --> 27:36.145
Falcón. Ah, sí. Y ahora, pescando en la iglesia... 
Ay no, por eso nosotros no hemos vuelto. Yo no, él sí

27:48.104 --> 27:49.926
fue una vez. Es

27:50.307 --> 27:55.033
triste. Sí, es triste. Y se pasa bien también. No se 
ve nada. No, todo es agua. El tanque del waterworks

28:05.427 --> 28:13.137
que teníamos, que tenía él allá, estuvo un año 
dentro de la casa. Oh, in one onion.

28:28.912 --> 28:32.256
And he never got confused. Yes. But these things 
are much later. Yes. Well, when did you get

28:40.205 --> 28:43.148
married? We got married in 1933. 1933. We are going 
to get married. Forty years. Forty years. How

28:55.863 --> 28:56.724
beautiful. Right? Yes. And here in Zapata? In 
Zapata Viejo. In what? In Zapata Viejo. In Zapata

29:03.654 --> 29:06.561
Viejo. I can't find it. Yes. And you, in these 
years, you were, how do you say, banker? El jefe del

29:17.056 --> 29:20.001
banco. No, ya para el 33 ya había dejado yo el banco. 
Tú del 19, del 20 al 30 estuvo en el banco. ¿Verdad? O

29:31.461 --> 29:32.503
del 19 al 29. Del 19 al 29. ¿Verdad, la gente? From 
1919 to 1920.

29:40.482 --> 29:42.425
More or less 1919. You opened the bank. Is it a 
federal bank? No, it was unincorporated. And you

29:58.627 --> 30:01.351
and others? No. El que lo organizó era un abogado de 
Laredo. Fue el que vino a organizarlo. Y me dejó a mí

30:09.901 --> 30:17.392
ahí como

30:09.901 --> 30:17.392
cajero. Era todo porque después entró una 
muchacha. Sí.

30:25.865 --> 30:30.111
Y después, pues, ¿ahora qué tipo de trabajo haces 
después? I don't have any. A little bit of a ranch

30:36.149 --> 30:46.443
and a little bit of... You're retired. I'm 
retired, yes. It's good. But you also have... You

30:50.107 --> 30:55.454
run the estate of that uncle. Estate. Estate. Yes. 
I'm the administrator of the estate of that

30:57.617 --> 31:05.127
gentleman and also of his wife. .

31:14.673 --> 31:23.902
Negotiations

31:14.673 --> 31:23.902
with land. .

31:34.250 --> 31:35.331
Rentals. Rentals and plants. Petroleum. 
Petroleum too. Did you have land too? Something.

31:48.203 --> 31:49.244
Something? Something there that belonged to my 
mother. Half of what belonged to my mother. And

31:57.452 --> 32:01.476
your land isn't under the dam, is it? No. It's very 
far. Hebron? Do you know where Hebron is? A little

32:08.264 --> 32:08.845
further? Hebronville. More here. More here, more 
inside, near San Antonio? No, no, no. No, there's a

32:12.468 --> 32:14.010
school. From Hebron? Is this Hebron? Yes. Ah, yes. 
Near Hebron. Perfect.

32:22.398 --> 32:28.585
Well, maybe... Oh, why did you never go to Mexico? 
The bank or something else?

32:34.257 --> 32:35.399
Well, no. You get used to living here. Well, he used 
to go before because he had his father's land. But

32:47.377 --> 32:49.720
then he sold it to one of their families. So now, 
since he sold it, he no longer has a business there.

32:56.631 --> 33:00.276
He only has family to visit. But the land was 
finally sold to him. It's all here in the United

33:03.198 --> 33:05.381
States. Tell him why. Well, there was the danger of 
the agrarians and all that. Well, I couldn't live

33:15.657 --> 33:20.684
there in the field, right? The agrarian law in 
Mexico is very hard. Yes. And they realize that

33:26.733 --> 33:29.998
there is a field that the owner doesn't... And I

33:31.143 --> 33:57.943
told him,

33:59.020 --> 34:02.746
The agrarian law is passed on to you. And he sold it 
to some cousins. Well, frankly, I didn't want to

34:07.573 --> 34:14.483
sell it, but the lady... Oh, yes, because here very 
close... Is there a gymnasium? Yes. A little

34:14.623 --> 34:18.409
closer to the gymnasium, with about six or eight 
people. On the other side. Yes. All the land is

34:21.654 --> 34:22.595
gone. All the owners had to leave because the 
agrarian law came and took it away. Todos. Una

34:27.635 --> 34:28.997
parte muy grande. Se salieron ranchos, varios 
ranchitos y todo, que tenían sus terrenos. Y

34:34.505 --> 34:44.219
entonces ellos tuvieron que irse a Guerrero, 
porque la ley agraria llegó ahí y se los quitó, los

34:34.505 --> 34:44.219
terrenos, y se los dio a otras personas. Y entonces 
yo le dije, yo no quisiera que tu terreno le

34:44.239 --> 34:50.709
sucediera eso, mandarle que lo venga. Sí. Y él le 
gusta conservar las cosas, batalló. Le hacía...

34:57.560 --> 35:02.546
It's sad to leave those who were for their father. 
But from there I said to him, and if the agrarians

35:02.566 --> 35:11.939
come and take him, it's sadder. And he sold him to 
some cousins who live there. Some cousins

35:16.885 --> 35:21.932
who live in Nuevo Lago. Because I was afraid that 
the agrarians would leave. And did the cousins

35:24.593 --> 35:28.157
have problems with the agrarians? No, I don't 
think so. As they live there. Those who live in

35:32.322 --> 35:40.551
their ranches,

35:32.322 --> 35:40.551
they don't have the agrarian law there. But the 
lands that are a little uninhabited, that the

35:40.631 --> 35:53.065
owner doesn't give them a lot of heat to sustain 
them well, like a very big ranch, they have the

35:40.631 --> 35:53.065
agrarian law. Ah, sí, yo entiendo. La ley es para 
dueños que no viven en tierra. Eso, exactamente. Y

36:03.346 --> 36:04.367
los primos, ¿sí viven allá? Los primos viven y son 
rancheros. Sí, allí están siempre y trabajan, y

36:06.570 --> 36:11.695
tienen trabajadores que les ayudan y todo eso. Y 
casas en su tierra y todo. Sí. Pero no fue posible

36:14.458 --> 36:19.564
para usted tener casa allá en México y otro aquí. 
Irnos a vivir allá, pues no podía. Sí. I don't

36:23.268 --> 36:25.792
understand. He understood me. What is this? A 
cart. What is a cart? A cart. It's very fast. Yes, it

36:32.924 --> 36:35.448
goes very fast. Well, during the days of the Falcon 
Dam, what happened here? Oh, a lot happened. A lot

36:48.609 --> 36:49.090
happened? Let's see what the gentleman has to say.

36:58.793 --> 37:11.351
Well, the expropriations of the Falcón

36:58.793 --> 37:11.351
prison forced us to leave at the end of 1953. That's 
when Zapata moved to this place. The Commission of

37:19.293 --> 37:34.015
Limits, which is international, there is a 
commission in Mexico, there is a commission here.

37:34.495 --> 37:41.065
The commission on this side did not intend to 
change Zapata. But in the end, someone forced them

37:42.361 --> 37:56.184
and the only thing they did was to clean the land and 
scratch the sunsets, mark the sunsets on the

37:42.361 --> 37:56.184
streets. And then each one of them built their 
house as best they could and they paid us for the

37:56.204 --> 38:04.217
houses we had there. And then, frankly, the people 
of Zapata have come to do it for their own effort.

38:16.201 --> 38:17.223
It's growing a lot. They were lucky to have a 
tourist attraction, I don't know why. It has very

38:25.837 --> 38:29.904
good hotels, it has very good restaurants. And one 
thing attracts another. There is already a very

38:32.648 --> 38:42.862
large Sajona population here. We are already more 
or less the 50 or 60% of Mexicans and the 40 or 50%

38:44.544 --> 38:53.977
Sajones. In general, they are old people who are 
already retired. El condado de Zapata ha sido un

39:00.020 --> 39:09.072
condado de gentes muy buenas. Nosotros decimos 
que la gente buena del condado de Zapata vino de

39:09.873 --> 39:19.265
Guerrero. La verdad de las cosas es que el condado 
de Zapata es un pueblo, es un condado de gentes

39:19.306 --> 39:28.778
pacíficas, gentes muy buenas. Yes. And 
everything that is coming right now are equally

39:29.708 --> 39:35.595
very good people. There are no discriminatory 
problems of any species.

39:42.362 --> 39:43.103
Yes. I was lucky to have a very good population and 
the new population that came was also very good.

39:52.774 --> 39:57.600
And you live here in Zapata very... There is a 
certain comfort, a certain security. There is

40:04.283 --> 40:08.409
much less crime than in other parts. Especially 
juvenile crime. It seems that here in Zapata there

40:12.676 --> 40:17.824
is none. And in other cities there is a lot of

40:18.685 --> 40:27.098
that. But this thing of good people is the same with 
new shoes and old shoes. Are they the same? Thank

40:40.338 --> 40:40.959
you. He doesn't

40:41.019 --> 40:47.111
because he's going to talk. He's going to cough.

40:54.449 --> 41:04.764
Well, and Guerrero Nuevo, is it like Zapata or 
different?

41:04.784 --> 41:12.555
Well, on the Mexican side, the Mexican Commission 
worked on a different problem. The problem of

41:12.575 --> 41:14.538
what? The Mexican Commission did build a town. 
Yes. And all those who lived in Guerrero Viejo se lo

41:24.453 --> 41:29.180
llevó y fue y les entregó las casas ya hechas. 
Nosotros teníamos casa en Guerrero, pero no me la

41:30.662 --> 41:39.554
pudieron dar porque no vivía yo en ella. Alguna vez 
me dijo a mí un ingeniero que sí me la daba como

41:39.614 --> 41:48.988
quisiera, pero pues no, yo mejor decidimos 
venderla, me la pagaron. Él me dijo, si quiere casa

41:49.008 --> 41:52.873
en Guerrero Nuevo, se la damos. We put it there that 
they lived in Guerrero too. Because their

41:59.251 --> 42:05.238
commitment was to make houses for those who lived 
in Guerrero.

42:07.720 --> 42:08.581
Yes. And on that side, in that respect, the Mexican 
Commission worked better, because they gave them

42:08.962 --> 42:18.813
the house made. New. New, with electric lights, 
But when we came here, there was still no water? No,

42:28.865 --> 42:30.207
no water. There was the plant, but it

42:30.227 --> 42:41.159
wasn't good to drink. It's on this

42:41.259 --> 42:47.987
side. We couldn't drink it. We had to drink water 
from the plant, from Zapata 10. We had to drink it

42:51.811 --> 42:53.073
from the plant, from Zapata 10. We had to drink it 
from the plant, from Zapata 10. We had to drink it

42:54.656 --> 42:55.357
from Zapata 10. We had to drink it from Zapata 10. We 
had to drink it from Zapata 10. We had to drink it

42:56.799 --> 42:57.760
from Zapata 10. We had to drink it from Zapata 10. We 
had to drink it from Zapata 10. We had to drink it

42:59.222 --> 42:59.903
from Zapata 10. We had to drink it from Zapata 10. We 
had to drink it from Zapata 10. We had to drink it

43:01.406 --> 43:02.087
from Zapata 10. We had to drink it from Zapata 10. We 
had to drink it from Zapata 10. We had to drink it

43:03.509 --> 43:04.190
from Zapata 10. We had to drink it from Zapata 10. We 
had to drink it from Zapata 10. We had to drink it

43:05.612 --> 43:06.313
from Zapata 10. We had to drink it from Zapata 10. We 
had to drink it from ¿Es mejor o estaba mejor,

43:08.690 --> 43:22.304
piensa usted, el plan de Guerrero Nuevo o plan de 
Zapata Nuevo? Bueno, yo diría que al principio fue

43:22.644 --> 43:34.697
mejor el plan de Guerrero, el plan de aquí porque 
They brought them to a new town, already built,

43:35.504 --> 43:44.236
with paved streets, with drainage, with 
everything, right? They gave them their houses

43:44.256 --> 43:46.539
ready. But now, later... I

43:49.664 --> 43:59.097
consider that it went even better than Guerrero. 
Why? because of the effort of their people. The

44:02.771 --> 44:09.443
commission didn't do anything. They paid for the 
houses, but when we came, we ran out of money to

44:09.463 --> 44:16.996
build houses. We brought the houses, but they 
didn't come in good quality. Yes, because of the

44:21.758 --> 44:27.885
movement. Does the government pay for this 
movement? Yes, the government paid for the house

44:32.570 --> 44:40.018
and then sold it to me for something else, so I could 
take it out. But they didn't pay for you to take it

44:40.038 --> 44:44.462
out. No. Well, if I understand correctly, the 
Mexican government does a lot more help in

44:45.299 --> 44:54.888
Guerrero. At first, yes. At first, with water and 
houses and everything. Here in Zapata, the

45:00.654 --> 45:03.857
government doesn't do much. Well, I didn't want to 
do much, but I went to

45:04.098 --> 45:12.606
El Paso,

45:15.556 --> 45:21.884
In a commission we went from Zapata to talk to the 
Commissioner of Limits. Yes. With Mr. Loza. We

45:24.807 --> 45:30.794
went to talk to him to see what he could offer. Here 
in Zapata there was a lot of talk and a lot of

45:30.815 --> 45:38.744
politics in those days. Yes. While a group of 
people They said it was going to be a modern town

45:42.927 --> 45:50.416
with all kinds of facilities and this and that. The 
other group said they were not going to do

45:50.436 --> 45:54.101
anything. No, the opinions were divided. I went 
with a commission to El Paso and the American

45:57.085 --> 46:09.981
commissioner told us...
