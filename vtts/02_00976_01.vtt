WEBVTT

00:01.094 --> 00:03.738
Were you stationed and what squadron were you 
flying with? I was stationed in Yuban, Thailand. I

00:06.822 --> 00:13.592
was with the 497 squadron in the 8th wing. We were 
the night, we had the night mission ordinarily. I

00:18.499 --> 00:21.844
was not on a night mission when I got shot down. 
Okay, what type of mission were you flying? I was

00:23.887 --> 00:25.129
flying mid-cap. Okay. And we had diverted from the 
strike force to meet some MiGs coming up from the

00:30.811 --> 00:36.296
south, from Hanoi. And we were up there just north 
of Hanoi.

00:44.943 --> 00:49.527
In fact, I had started letting down chasing MiGs 
when I got shot down. How were you shot down? Was it a

00:50.288 --> 00:51.149
SAM? No, I think it was ground fire. I just felt the 
hit. It felt like just a single hit. in the engine

01:00.410 --> 01:02.552
section of the airplane. But it was, it really, you 
know, started, all the lights coming on, and I just

01:03.273 --> 01:27.340
started climbing out back toward, back toward 
Laos when the controls burned through and I just,

01:03.273 --> 01:27.340
you know, the airplane kind of went ballistic.

01:28.161 --> 01:29.202
Were you injured or wounded? When you were shot 
down? Or during your parachute down? No, not

01:34.151 --> 01:34.972
really. I had a little superficial shot on my leg 
and on my chin, and that's all. Were you captured

01:42.198 --> 01:46.603
immediately after you parachuted out, or were you 
on the ground a couple days, hours? No, I was... I

01:49.826 --> 01:57.653
would think it was probably...

01:49.826 --> 01:57.653
not more than about an hour, but it seemed longer 
than that. I was able to, I landed on top of a big

01:58.156 --> 02:15.441
hill, and the people from down below had seen the 
chutes, both my chute and my back chute, because

01:58.156 --> 02:15.441
the airplane had crashed before we got down. It was 
spinning. It spun in and hit the ground, so that

02:17.784 --> 02:23.833
alerted them to look up and see the chutes. And it 
was on a Sunday afternoon, kind of like today. a

02:28.531 --> 02:32.477
real bright, sunshiny day. So, yeah, they saw the 
chutes, and they came charging up the hill after

02:32.597 --> 02:36.804
us. But I had landed in a tree. My chute hung up in a 
tree, and I was just overhanging a big bluff. But

02:45.517 --> 02:52.207
only momentarily, I jerked on a vine that was 
nearby, and the chute released. I landed on a big

02:52.227 --> 02:57.475
limb of a tree, and I unbuckled myself from the... 
from the shoot and crawled down the tree and got out

02:58.417 --> 03:10.292
of there and found a place to get myself hidden. And 
hopefully to make it till dark so that I could head

03:10.672 --> 03:14.497
west. And I got my compass out and broke a limb so 
that I'd know which direction to start off in and

03:14.858 --> 03:23.328
all that stuff. But

03:23.348 --> 03:27.073
they were coming up all around me, looking for me. I 
heard, you know, there were dogs and lots of

03:31.437 --> 03:36.764
people. So was it the Viet Cong or villagers? Just, 
I think, villagers and militia. Yeah, there was

03:42.011 --> 03:46.517
some militia. Some of the North Vietnam people, 
not in Viet Cong, of course, were in the South. This

03:50.042 --> 03:51.003
was up near Hanoi. Okay. And...

03:56.720 --> 04:08.932
They walked right by me, right very close to me, you 
know, several times over a period of an hour, two

03:56.720 --> 04:08.932
hours, sometimes, I don't know about that, time 
frame. Before

04:08.952 --> 04:16.099
I saw a bare pair of feet. It was just the one person 
who came up and I saw the feet stop and they started

04:16.119 --> 04:24.887
backing up. And then they turned and ran. So I knew 
that that person had spotted me. All I could see was

04:32.545 --> 04:34.367
the feet, though. And sure enough, of course, it 
came back shortly with

04:36.229 --> 04:42.436
some treatment. After you were captured, where 
were you first taken? Well,

04:48.623 --> 04:55.110
there was a big crowd. that gathered around me when 
they captured me. And there were two people, and

05:01.399 --> 05:06.506
they were civilians up there, but they could speak 
a little bit of English. Two men who kind of took

05:06.526 --> 05:18.681
charge, and they, in fact, this one guy fired off a 
pistol right close to my head from behind me, and it

05:06.526 --> 05:18.681
really scared me. I thought I was shot, but He was 
just warning the crowd and making them get back,

05:20.133 --> 05:25.579
because they had swarmed all over. We're trying to 
get all my clothes off. I mean, that's what. But he

05:30.664 --> 05:43.797
wanted to get me moving and out of the crowd so that 
he could claim credit for the capture and get

05:30.664 --> 05:43.797
whatever bounty that was offered. I think that was 
the reason. And so we took off. And we ran for

05:47.221 --> 05:49.363
several hours. during that afternoon until up 
until late well past dark and he secreted me into a

05:50.423 --> 06:19.317
place where they just held me there until they 
could turn me over to the army that evening later

05:50.423 --> 06:19.317
that evening they did just that and um along the way 
though there were there were people who were

06:20.174 --> 06:40.950
trying to get me away from these two people that had 
me sort of like they were jerking and you know and we

06:20.174 --> 06:40.950
were just running and they were kind of fending off 
the drought

06:20.174 --> 06:40.950
but at any rate they turned me over to the army that 
night and they were really We're rough, you know.

06:45.187 --> 06:49.513
My backseater showed up and they had him at another 
place. I hadn't seen him since we bailed out of the

06:49.533 --> 06:52.817
airplane. They put us both in the back of a little 
old Jeep type vehicle. And they took our boots off.

07:00.828 --> 07:03.451
We never saw those again. And they took a 
shoestring, one of the strings out of our boots and

07:03.471 --> 07:08.297
tied our big toes together along with... They had 
us all tied up anyhow, but... That was a

07:11.626 --> 07:22.900
particularly excruciating thing because they 
tied them real, real tight. Kind of an odd thing to

07:22.921 --> 07:25.964
do, but that's what they did. So did the Army take 
you to a real POW encampment? They spent about

07:30.711 --> 07:39.642
three days just kind of fooling around and keeping 
us in one little place or another. during the day

07:40.347 --> 07:49.157
and moving at night kind of secreting us into 
Hanoi. We ferried across the river and so on. We

07:53.401 --> 07:55.864
weren't very far from Hanoi from the beginning. I 
figure maybe 30, 40 miles to the northwest. But it

08:03.332 --> 08:08.818
took them about three days to get us to the Hanoi 
Hilton downtown Hanoi. Did they have any

08:10.148 --> 08:15.816
English-speaking people there to question you or 
interrogate you once you got there? Yeah. What

08:17.558 --> 08:20.802
subjects did they try to cover during the 
interrogation?

08:24.047 --> 08:26.670
Well, that's hard to explain. They asked military 
questions. But the interrogators, my impression

08:30.115 --> 08:37.084
then and later was that You know, they were very 
crude. And the questions they asked were things

08:42.030 --> 08:47.156
that were readily available to them. I mean, the 
answers to that is in any kind of publication.

08:52.223 --> 08:59.672
There's nothing else that would have been any kind 
of a military secret. Just, you know,

08:59.892 --> 09:08.202
what squadron were you in and those kinds of 
things. They had rosters in the squadron, so that

09:08.485 --> 09:12.852
wasn't a good thing. But they did it. And, of 
course, we and me, all of us, resisted to answering

09:15.576 --> 09:27.934
any questions, regardless of our innocuacy.

09:27.954 --> 09:35.826
And so it was pretty tough because they were, as I 
said, it seemed to me that they were just in the

09:27.954 --> 09:35.826
business of... practicing interrogation 
procedures and they were going to torture us,

09:36.548 --> 09:49.401
physically torture us, regardless of what the 
answers were. The answers were kind of

09:49.481 --> 09:51.486
irrelevant. But boy, they knew how to administer 
the torture, and they did that. In my case, they

09:58.696 --> 10:16.795
kept me in the interrogation slash torture room 
under really bad conditions for about a week, I

09:58.696 --> 10:16.795
think. I kind of lost track of time, because they 
really I took most of it out. And then they finally

10:23.417 --> 10:33.893
took me to a cell in the Hanoi Hilton, a little 
corner of the prison called the Mint. There were

10:35.275 --> 10:37.037
three cells back there. And I was the only one back 
there. And the cell was about three feet wide by

10:41.804 --> 10:49.536
about six feet long. It wasn't quite as long as I 
was. And the bunk was 18 inches wide, and it was just

10:53.576 --> 11:15.628
hard wood, a wooden bench with ankle stocks in it, 
with a locker which was manipulated on the outside

10:53.576 --> 11:15.628
of the wall, which was about that big. And they kept 
me locked in the stocks. I stayed back there, I

11:19.790 --> 11:26.216
don't know, I think it was about 40 days. See, I had 
to be certain. Finally got moved up there to

11:29.719 --> 11:31.981
another part of the prison. Still in solitary, 
though. Uh-huh. Sometime

11:37.085 --> 11:42.810
in February, I think. And then I was still there in 
solitary for... I told them about 90 days before

11:49.743 --> 11:54.812
they moved me. They moved me to the zoo then. 
Uh-huh. How many POWs were in the camp at the time,

11:58.760 --> 12:10.802
or did you have any exposure to other POWs 
following your isolation?

12:10.822 --> 12:12.645
Well, where I was, I didn't know that I was in a camp 
where there were any more POWs. I was back in the

12:18.153 --> 12:24.821
corner all by myself until I moved up into another 
little area of the prison. It wasn't very far away

12:24.841 --> 12:36.376
from the man, but there were other POWs and other 
cells in that kind of hallway.

12:37.317 --> 12:39.139
But they went to extremes. measures to be sure that 
nobody saw anybody else or nobody communicated.

12:48.016 --> 13:00.435
Although we managed

12:48.016 --> 13:00.435
to do a little of that and got caught at it and got 
tortured for it and so on. I read a Reisner's book,

13:01.090 --> 13:14.447
The Passing of the Night, and he talks about, did 
y'all communicate with codes, tapping, and...

13:01.090 --> 13:14.447
Uh-huh.

13:16.670 --> 13:20.815
Uh-huh.

13:20.935 --> 13:23.458
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

13:27.044 --> 13:31.949
What y'all tried to find out when other prisoners 
came in and learned the names, the dog tag numbers?

13:32.190 --> 13:36.474
Oh, yeah, we kept all the names. Uh-huh. It was just 
big volumes of communications every day. Uh-huh.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.864
Could you describe, like, a daily life in camp? Is 
there such a thing as a routine day? Well...

13:52.632 --> 13:55.616
I don't know if I can remember. Uh... Routinely, 
you know, we got up early. The gong went off, I

14:04.317 --> 14:09.944
guess, about daylight. And we'd get up and just 
make up, then take the mosquito net down. We had

14:20.980 --> 14:24.945
mosquito nets most of the time in the village. And

14:25.432 --> 14:34.104
just wait around in there until, then usually they 
came by with water. I don't know, it was like about

14:35.005 --> 14:37.489
nine o'clock. And

14:39.051 --> 14:47.463
we'd fill up our little, everybody had an 
individual little jug for water. You'd get one of

14:47.483 --> 14:51.989
them a day, a quart. They might let you out to go, In 
this place where we were, they had a bunch of wells,

14:55.992 --> 15:15.309
hand-dug wells, that you could take a bucket with a 
rope and bail out some old muddy water, and you

14:55.992 --> 15:15.309
could wash, dump a bucket of it over your head. So 
sometimes the guard, if he got around to it, would

15:15.329 --> 15:23.356
go start doing that and give everybody. He'd take 
one group out, put them in this little fenced-in

15:26.232 --> 15:44.308
area around the well, let them have, you know, if 
there were three of us, in the case of when I was in

15:26.232 --> 15:44.308
the zoo for about 13 months, I lived with just two 
other guys, Red McDaniel and Al Runyon. Then he'd

15:45.810 --> 15:53.016
give us maybe 20 minutes or so in there to get, and 
then put us back in the cell and get another group,

15:45.810 --> 15:53.016
you know. But... Theoretically, we weren't 
supposed to know that there was anybody else

15:55.983 --> 16:00.028
around anywhere. And then they'd bring a meal that 
was, you know, it'd just be a big bucket that was

16:00.068 --> 16:16.949
carried on shoulder poles, or two of them, of soup 
and some rice. The soup was just boiled weeds, like

16:16.989 --> 16:25.720
some of that stuff there or something, but... We 
call it sewer weed because it grew in a cesspool

16:26.223 --> 16:33.035
area.

16:34.238 --> 16:36.301
And what did you start saying? Go ahead. I was just 
going to ask, did you have any physical exercise or

16:36.722 --> 16:41.691
did you exercise in your cells? Most of us 
exercised every day in our cells, you know, just

16:43.154 --> 16:49.986
run in place.

16:51.907 --> 16:54.591
doing a little calisthenics and that sort of 
thing. You mentioned the sewer soup. With the

16:57.215 --> 17:02.162
conditions and climate, illnesses must have been 
common. Did you have any means of trying to prevent

17:02.182 --> 17:05.727
illnesses? Did they allow any medication or 
anything like that? Well, from time to time, and

17:10.013 --> 17:20.749
that went up and down with the moods and the 
so-called treatment at the time. They would claim

17:21.539 --> 17:30.888
to have medical people attend to people who asked 
for it and so on. But it was not anything that I would

17:32.049 --> 17:40.396
ever ask for.

17:41.738 --> 17:44.800
And yeah, we had sicknesses from time to time. We 
had a gross epidemic one time of pinkeye.

17:51.425 --> 17:59.333
awfulest mess you've ever seen, and virtually 99% 
of everybody in the cells got it. Just went through

18:00.234 --> 18:01.736
like wildfire. And it lasted a week or so, but 
everybody's eyes were just unbelievable. Looked

18:07.722 --> 18:16.131
like the whites were like real red egg whites that 
were kind of spilling out of your eyelids, you

18:07.722 --> 18:16.131
know, just all swollen. Felt like Your eyes were 
full of gravel. And there was a lot of diarrhea, of

18:23.287 --> 18:31.177
course, and dysentery and stuff like that. But 
nothing really was ever done about it. Besides

18:38.886 --> 18:43.411
physical exercises, did you have mental 
exercises? I talked to some of the POWs, and they

18:43.572 --> 18:48.938
mentally constructed things or mentally read 
books. What did you try to do? Oh yeah, it was

18:50.305 --> 18:55.553
fantastic some of the things that people did up 
there. I know Nolan Daughtry reconstructed all

18:55.793 --> 19:07.892
the trigonometry

18:55.793 --> 19:07.892
love rhythms.

19:08.553 --> 19:11.497
A couple of times he did that, went through that 
exercise. On paper, he got it down because we

19:11.798 --> 19:16.545
would, you know, we'd get toilet paper, real rough 
old brown paper, just sheets of it. And we had, we

19:24.413 --> 19:27.797
used all kinds of different things to write with. 
We found a little piece of stick and sharpened it on

19:27.817 --> 19:45.216
the concrete and mixed cigarette ashes with,

19:27.817 --> 19:45.216
later on we had Kool-Aid from the packages 
sometimes and some sugar. And that sort of thing,

19:46.664 --> 19:51.910
and make something, make an ink that would write 
nicely. But so anyhow, a lot of that kind of thing.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.358
People designed houses. And then later on, when we 
got into bigger groups, we had a lot of classes. But

20:06.388 --> 20:16.080
just as an example, I spent about three months, a 
little over three months in solitary confinement

20:06.388 --> 20:16.080
in the spring of 1980. 1971,

20:17.765 --> 20:21.590
I think. Yeah, it was after the Sante raid, and we 
all moved back to Hanoi. They piled us all in the

20:26.977 --> 20:29.620
Hilton again. And it was in that spring. There was 
another guy, a friend who was also in solitary in

20:31.583 --> 20:43.978
the Heartbreak Hotel cell block, which is where we 
were. And I never smoked. But we always got a little

20:47.262 --> 20:51.908
ration of three cigarettes a day. Usually, I 
think. And I always took mine and gave them to the

20:54.831 --> 20:57.855
smokers, you know. But anyhow, when I was in 
solitary, I'd take my cigarette ration and wrap it

20:59.978 --> 21:08.588
in a little piece of paper and deposit it in an area. 
And they had what we called the shower. There was a

21:13.434 --> 21:14.856
little a faucet in there that dripped a little bit. 
And we were allowed in there, though, every day for

21:18.511 --> 21:23.017
a few minutes, or most every day. And I had a way of 
communicating with this fellow. And he was an

21:30.406 --> 21:34.512
expert in several subjects. But French was his big 
thing. He kind of taught himself French by swiping

21:43.945 --> 22:01.392
French publications when he went to quiz and so on 
with the D, and he'd have a similar one in English,

21:43.945 --> 22:01.392
so he'd just look at the different transcript of 
the French, and he'd talk himself French. So he was

22:01.532 --> 22:07.120
leaving me French lessons every day, and I left him 
my cigarettes. The French lessons... were

22:09.511 --> 22:11.554
written out on toilet paper. He found a little 
chunk of lime. They use a lot of lime to whitewash

22:13.837 --> 22:17.763
walls with and that sort of thing. And you could use 
that to write with, too. So I studied French for

22:24.192 --> 22:29.399
those three months. I'd like to ask you some 
questions about how different events affected

22:31.482 --> 22:38.252
prisoners' treatments.

22:39.312 --> 22:42.695
What about when Nixon started bombing Cambodia? 
Was there a change in the treatment, or did you even

22:42.895 --> 22:46.239
know that was going on? Oh, yeah. We got their 
version of what was going on in the war all the time.

22:54.206 --> 23:05.337
They'd turn on the loudspeaker at night in the 
cells, and it was very difficult to understand.

23:05.705 --> 23:08.888
and most people didn't even bother and didn't even 
try to listen. I usually listen some just to try to

23:09.569 --> 23:17.077
read between the lines and see what I could pick up. 
But yes, the treatment was up and down a lot and it

23:18.338 --> 23:32.813
did seem to vary with how the war was going and that 
sort of thing throughout the years.

23:34.955 --> 23:35.155
But It was hard to predict what their reaction was 
going to be. Their propaganda was everything was

23:40.963 --> 23:46.228
going in their favor all the time. During the Paris 
peace talks, did y'all find out about those going

23:46.268 --> 23:49.591
on? Oh, yeah. We heard about them. What about when 
North Vietnamese sympathizers like Jane Fonda

23:53.154 --> 23:59.039
came over to y'all? I'm sure they used that as heavy 
propaganda. Did they let y'all know that she was

24:03.263 --> 24:05.125
coming over? Well,

24:07.484 --> 24:16.473
they used her and all of those kinds of people to the 
nth degree. And what they tried to do was set up a

24:16.513 --> 24:32.050
situation to portray what they wanted them to see 
to take back to the world. Well, most of us. Never

24:33.910 --> 24:35.632
saw any of those people. All we heard was what we 
heard on the box. We'd hear her making her

24:39.096 --> 24:45.863
anti-U.S. statements and that sort of thing. But 
she would visit with, they had a few POWs isolated

24:48.005 --> 25:00.238
somewhere away from us that were cooperative with 
them. in exchange, I guess, for good treatment or

25:01.855 --> 25:05.602
whatever. And so those are the people that they got 
to see. Did you go on the march through Hanoi when

25:12.334 --> 25:20.048
everybody's going back to the Hilton? No, that 
occurred before I was shot down. Okay. the famous

25:24.012 --> 25:27.516
march. Now that was just a deal where they came and 
got all the prisoners one night and marched them

25:27.536 --> 25:48.303
through the streets to let the people, to incite 
the people into hating the American air pirates,

25:27.536 --> 25:48.303
that sort of thing. That was the purpose of that. It 
was pretty infamous because it caused a lot of

25:50.742 --> 26:15.197
uproar throughout

25:50.742 --> 26:15.197
the world when they saw films of that, of

25:50.742 --> 26:15.197
the bad treatment of prisoners by the Vietnamese.

26:17.607 --> 26:24.253
The Tet Offensive happened right after your 
capture, a month after your capture. Did you hear

26:25.274 --> 26:27.956
anything about that either before or after? Did 
you hear any rumors before or after your capture?

26:32.180 --> 26:34.462
Well, not before, I don't think. But the Tet 
Offensive was just a part of all the

26:34.742 --> 26:47.293
propaganda-type war news that they routinely put 
out. At the time, I knew you could tell that there

26:47.459 --> 26:58.157
indeed was some

26:47.459 --> 26:58.157
heavy fighting and all that in the South. But it 
didn't sound extraordinary to me. It just sounded

27:02.043 --> 27:04.087
like routine war news. So I didn't pay a heck of a lot 
of attention to it. After you were finally

27:09.734 --> 27:18.606
released and came back to the United States, how 
did you handle the transition from being captive

27:09.734 --> 27:18.606
to free again? Was it difficult to realize that you 
were actually free at first or just when they told

27:18.626 --> 27:26.296
you the news? No. You know, all the years I was up 
there, I always associated with or, you know,

27:30.021 --> 27:39.454
affiliated with the guys who we called the 
optimists. We had two different types of people.

27:51.916 --> 28:02.167
Obviously, most of us, I think, were optimists and 
felt like we kept kidding ourselves, at least,

27:51.916 --> 28:02.167
that we're going to get out sooner rather than 
later. And if Christmas was coming up, well, we'd

28:02.207 --> 28:09.795
say, well, we're going to be home by Christmas, no 
problem. And that went on for about six

28:10.400 --> 28:13.225
Christmases, you know. But then if Christmas 
didn't make it, well, it was New Year's or Tet or

28:13.285 --> 28:20.977
Easter or the Fourth of July or whatever. But we 
always had a target date, you know, and we felt like

28:21.478 --> 28:28.930
one of these days one of them was going to hit and we 
weren't going to get the release. So we all had

28:28.970 --> 28:34.619
assured ourselves that we were going to be 
released. The other guys... We called the VODs,

28:36.151 --> 28:40.960
the Voices of Doom, and said, you know, we're never 
going to get out of here. We're going to be here for

28:41.060 --> 28:44.446
the rest of our lives and so on. But anyhow, so, 
yeah, I expected to get released. And, of course, I

28:52.661 --> 28:56.809
was very elated to get released. And I didn't have 
any trouble adjusting to being free again. That's

29:01.556 --> 29:04.939
the easiest thing I ever tried to do in my life. The 
reason why I asked that, I had read some, not from

29:04.979 --> 29:21.497
the Vietnam War, but from the World War II 
prisoners of war that had trouble realizing that

29:04.979 --> 29:21.497
they could actually do things over again without 
worrying about repercussions. What was the

29:22.000 --> 29:27.286
impact of being a POW on your career and your life? 
Well, other than just being on

29:28.787 --> 29:38.017
hold for about five and a half years. But, you know, 
we were, it wasn't totally

29:38.538 --> 29:51.872
lost because we were at a military organization as 
POWs and we were operating in a in a very tough,

29:52.696 --> 29:57.981
realistically tough environment. So there was a 
lot to be learned from that. And I think many of us,

30:02.384 --> 30:14.055
at least, I believe, benefited a lot from those 
years of operating in an organization under those

30:02.384 --> 30:14.055
conditions. So we learned and matured through 
that, I think. So all you know. I feel like that had I

30:23.071 --> 30:34.321
not been shot down, that I would have had more 
opportunities maybe in my career. But gosh, I

30:34.381 --> 30:45.050
couldn't have possibly had things happen any 
better for me career-wise after I was shot down.

30:45.430 --> 30:50.135
During the rest of my active duty career, my 
assignments were the greatest. I couldn't have

30:50.195 --> 30:52.977
asked for anything better. than I had. So, you 
know, it turned out real well, for me at least. I'd

31:02.372 --> 31:05.315
like to get your opinions on a couple of subjects. 
Do you think we should use our troops in a military

31:06.597 --> 31:12.403
conflict without a firm commitment from our 
government to win? Like a similar, you know, to

31:14.726 --> 31:17.809
Vietnam? Obviously, you know, that The answer to 
that question is pretty obvious. We should not

31:24.022 --> 31:41.046
be involved in something that we're not going to be 
committed to win if we're going to expose our

31:24.022 --> 31:41.046
troops to the hazards that they were exposed to 
there. But the military is an instrument of

31:42.147 --> 31:50.098
government. And I feel like that our government 
ought to have the freedom to use the military arm

31:51.783 --> 32:00.735
for what it's for. And I think it has application in 
places like Lebanon and in Central America. Those

32:11.931 --> 32:17.378
kinds of situations are very, very difficult to 
handle politically. And if the military can help

32:18.159 --> 32:20.963
out with that, And that's our job, and we ought to do 
it. I don't think we ought to get involved in a big,

32:24.598 --> 32:34.791
full-scale war in Lebanon like we did in Vietnam, 
certainly. But I think what we're doing over there

32:34.831 --> 32:49.330
is not unreasonable, and it's something that we 
need to do and should do to help at least to give...

32:51.453 --> 32:57.860
the Lebanese government the opportunity to get 
stabilized.

33:01.324 --> 33:01.565
Okay. In Reiser's book again, he believed that the 
longer anybody was in camp, the more

33:03.247 --> 33:11.556
nationalistic and more religious that person 
became. Do you agree with that statement? I think

33:15.381 --> 33:19.165
what he's probably saying there is that I think as a 
general rule it did apply to most of us up there,

33:21.946 --> 33:30.637
that more patriotic, is that what you mean? Yes, 
more patriotic. See, we depended totally on our

33:33.140 --> 33:38.287
country to get us out of there. So we had to believe 
in our country if we ever expected to get out of

33:39.008 --> 33:42.872
there, right? And I think that was part of that. Now 
there were a few who turned the other way. So I guess

33:51.089 --> 33:54.292
that's the point he was making there. And then, of 
course, the other thing that many of us would also

33:54.432 --> 34:14.530
depend on, since we are pretty helpless to do 
anything very positive ourselves, we turn to God

33:54.432 --> 34:14.530
to help us. And so I think religion, if you ever had 
any, would be more pronounced in a situation like

34:20.502 --> 34:25.919
that because you need every bit of help you can get. 
Let me change the tape over.
