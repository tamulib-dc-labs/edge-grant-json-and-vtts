WEBVTT

00:10.645 --> 00:17.618
An explanation is acceptable, but the truth of the 
matter is I drank beer with my friend about two

00:10.645 --> 00:17.618
hours when I got to the airport last night. 
Suffering agony and pain this morning. No, thank

00:24.050 --> 00:24.531
you. Just iced tea would be fine.

00:32.085 --> 00:32.907
There's presently a A developing controversy in 
North Carolina and the other northeastern states

00:33.308 --> 00:42.603
on this potential evulsion has to do with 
pollution of the Atlantic coast. What role do you

00:43.765 --> 00:55.383
think scientists ought to play, academicians and 
scientists like yourself, in offering advice,

00:43.765 --> 00:55.383
opposition to, support for this environmental 
concern? Well, I think we are the people that

00:55.944 --> 00:59.890
should give the advice. When I say we, I mean 
environmental scientists because that's what I

01:01.034 --> 01:21.621
became after I came down here, but a lot of this 
horror that people express is based on a lack of

01:01.034 --> 01:21.621
knowledge and I don't think people can just sit at a 
desk at a university campus and come up with a whole

01:01.034 --> 01:21.621
answer. For example, Savannah a couple years ago, 
one of the companies that's been dumping sulfuric

01:22.022 --> 01:30.012
acid in the Savannah River, was ordered to stop 
doing that, so they decided to dump it in the ocean

01:30.717 --> 01:40.808
the way national lead does off the coast of New 
Jersey. And right away the sports fishermen in

01:41.308 --> 01:55.504
North Carolina put up a big clamor that they're 
going to destroy the Gulf Stream because this

01:41.308 --> 01:55.504
sulfuric acid is going to be carried to the coast of 
North Carolina. And the people in the Division of

02:00.738 --> 02:04.363
Fisheries, whatever it's called in Raleigh, got 
all worked up over this. Well, I sat down and did a

02:04.383 --> 02:20.143
little chemical oceanography with the numbers 
and showed that every day the Gulf Stream carries

02:04.383 --> 02:20.143
past North Carolina about 20,000 times as much 
sulfuric acid as what they were proposing to dump

02:04.383 --> 02:20.143
in and off Georgia. And also equally greater 
amounts of the trace metals that were going in with

02:20.263 --> 02:28.534
it that people were concerned with. This is a desk 
study, which is fun to do. But on the other hand, off

02:32.079 --> 02:39.947
New Jersey, where they've been dumping this now 
for 20 years, the fishing is actually a little

02:32.079 --> 02:39.947
better than it used to be. The sports fishermen 
actually go out to look for the acid ground as a

02:39.967 --> 02:48.295
place to fish, because there's enough iron oxide 
on the bottom, so the character of the bottom has

02:39.967 --> 02:48.295
changed. And apparently, this attracts the kind 
of fish they're chasing. So here's something

02:52.879 --> 02:58.605
based on an actual observation of what's been 
going on for 20 years. And yet the people of North

02:58.889 --> 03:03.513
Carolina didn't have any knowledge of this and 
immediately set up a big clamor against it. And

03:04.274 --> 03:05.495
this happens over and over again. This dumping of 
sewage sludge off of New York City, for example.

03:09.178 --> 03:10.479
You talk about the Dead Sea there. That's not so. 
I've looked at cores that the Army engineers had

03:12.881 --> 03:19.227
taken off New York Bight in this area. And you can't 
see any organic matter in the cores. It's just good

03:21.649 --> 03:24.172
gray gravel with pieces of brick in it. The organic 
matter is being removed very rapidly. So again,

03:29.230 --> 03:39.304
these assertions about polluting the ocean are 
based on a lack of knowledge and lack of

03:29.230 --> 03:39.304
observation. Did you become irritated when a man 
like Jacques Cousteau says, for example, that the

03:40.145 --> 03:44.410
sea is dying? No, because I admire Cousteau very 
much as an engineer and as an entrepreneur of

03:45.091 --> 03:55.305
television movies, but he's not qualified to 
speak about what he sees dying because he's never

03:55.623 --> 03:59.548
made a measurement of productivity in his life. He 
really doesn't know what that means. So it's a

04:02.431 --> 04:07.477
statement that doesn't carry any weight with me. 
Do you think that environmental publicists, to

04:07.497 --> 04:14.646
coin a word, are good for or bad for oceanography? 
That is, that a man like Cousteau, for example, or

04:15.166 --> 04:22.355
half a dozen others I can think of, have acquired a 
great amount of publicity for the oceans. Is this

04:22.896 --> 04:24.077
essentially a good thing? I don't think it hurts. 
It's strange. When I was small and told people I was

04:27.350 --> 04:31.075
going to be an oceanographer, they'd say, oh, do 
you know William Beebe? And then later on, when I

04:32.096 --> 04:36.222
said I was an oceanographer, they would say, oh, do 
you know Rachel Carson? And now they say, do you

04:36.883 --> 04:40.267
know Jacques Cousteau? So it always takes 
somebody like that to attract public interest to

04:40.287 --> 04:44.714
the field. And I don't see how this hurts.

04:49.080 --> 04:49.140
No. In terms of public interest to the field, 
quality of oceanographic education in the United

04:52.728 --> 05:03.443
States, having been involved in at least three 
different types of institutions and having also

04:52.728 --> 05:03.443
taught? What do you think? Is it capable, not 
capable? I think there's variation. I think that

05:07.869 --> 05:14.878
the best schools are considerably better than the 
worst schools. There's a great gradient. And if I

05:16.620 --> 05:22.228
were to hire a young man with a recent PhD in 
oceanography, I would consider carefully the

05:22.445 --> 05:30.036
school he got it from as one of the main criteria in 
deciding whether to hire him. Are Scripps and

05:30.217 --> 05:33.722
Woods Hole still the premier schools in 
oceanography at this time? I don't think Woods

05:34.784 --> 05:36.386
Hole is much of a school yet. They just recently got 
into the school business. But Scripps certainly,

05:38.249 --> 05:42.155
well, I have to say that because I came from there. 
Well, the whole point, the point is, or the

05:42.175 --> 05:51.068
question I'm trying to ask, is that it's been 
almost impossible, for example, in my

05:51.588 --> 05:57.694
profession, history, to take a school and make it a 
first-ranked school. My degree's from the

05:57.714 --> 05:59.076
University of Texas. It's a good second-ranked 
school. That's fine. You know, it's about as good

06:01.158 --> 06:10.327
in history as North Carolina, possibly not quite 
so, a little better than Tulane, not quite as good

06:01.158 --> 06:10.327
as the University of Michigan, and a mile away from 
Harvard and Yale. It's the same thing true in

06:11.208 --> 06:12.770
oceanography. Can you make an oceanographic 
institution a first-rate school? Well, I think

06:16.073 --> 06:20.498
some of those that have started pretty much from 
scratch have done very well. The Johns Hopkins

06:23.505 --> 06:26.710
operation, I think, was first right from the very 
beginning. Miami, I'd say, never has quite gotten

06:28.052 --> 06:32.719
off the ground. Now, this leads to another 
question about academic education. Originally,

06:39.148 --> 06:48.122
the concept of oceanography was to bring together 
people from a vast number of scientific

06:39.148 --> 06:48.122
disciplines excuse me, attach them to one place, 
and that was the School of Oceanography. Really,

06:54.257 --> 06:57.401
their only collective academic interest was the 
oceans, right? And each one put an input into the

06:57.961 --> 07:00.985
discipline itself. So there's no such thing, in 
effect, as oceanography. Let me explain it this

07:04.249 --> 07:05.050
way. However, lately oceanography has become, 
once more, more divided. That is, chemical

07:10.897 --> 07:13.680
oceanographers talk to chemical 
oceanographers.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.025
Is this the way you perceive I've

07:19.540 --> 07:24.887
seen it develop another way. We've

07:24.907 --> 07:43.050
gone from oceanography to marine science, and 
oceanography is a study of the ocean and its

07:24.907 --> 07:43.050
contents, but marine science is everything that 
you have to do from a ship, and this includes marine

07:24.907 --> 07:43.050
meteorology, which not many places do, but it also 
includes all this sort of stuff that Lamont

07:44.093 --> 07:51.986
Doherty does, and all this, and this deep-sea 
drilling project of NSF, which doesn't pay any

07:44.093 --> 07:51.986
attention to the ocean. To them, the ocean is a damn 
nuisance. They wish somebody would pull the plug

07:53.449 --> 07:58.297
out, let the water out, and then they could walk 
around instead of having to go out on the ship. So

08:00.921 --> 08:01.562
that There has been a change then from the point of 
view of studying the ocean as a system to studying

08:02.082 --> 08:19.137
the Earth's crust under the ocean, but still call 
this oceanography and get the oceanographic

08:02.082 --> 08:19.137
support for it, which has in the past distressed me 
a little bit. For example, when Lamont went into

08:19.738 --> 08:28.666
the IGY, the IGY was set up to do synoptic 
observations. How do you do synoptic geologic

08:30.938 --> 08:32.560
studies of the ocean floor. There's no particular 
need to do them one year as compared with another

08:32.641 --> 08:36.326
year. And yet they got a lot of funding during the 
IGY for carrying on just what they'd always been

08:37.067 --> 08:41.714
doing.

08:44.659 --> 08:50.287
There are glamour disciplines in oceanography, 
if I may try it this way. For example, everybody

08:51.049 --> 08:55.095
wants to be, in effect, a nuclear physicist in the 
1950s. In oceanography presently, some parts of

09:00.233 --> 09:07.423
it are in eclipse, that is physical oceanography 
and as a matter of fact marine oceanography in the

09:00.233 --> 09:07.423
sense of marine biology.

09:10.227 --> 09:13.352
What do you think will be the glamour fields for 
oceanography in the future? Well, I think that the

09:14.934 --> 09:29.835
big thrust in the future has to come from resource

09:14.934 --> 09:29.835
exploitation and this is fisheries and and waste 
disposal. In other words, studying the effects of

09:32.726 --> 09:38.474
man-made pollution on the ocean. Okay, so you see 
oceanography turning into a type of

09:38.494 --> 09:44.622
environmental studies?

09:51.831 --> 09:52.012
Yeah. People used to ask me, Whenever I said I was an 
oceanographer, by the way, in the middle of the

09:54.537 --> 10:00.625
60s, what about getting fresh water from the sea? I 
said, that's not an oceanographic problem. We've

10:02.247 --> 10:03.269
solved the problem. We provide the seawater. No 
one is an engineering problem.

10:10.638 --> 10:16.987
What sort of technological breakthroughs do you 
think occurred during your experience with

10:10.638 --> 10:16.987
oceanography that changed the nature of 
oceanography? Well, one of the greatest things

10:18.328 --> 10:24.156
was the development of the salinometer so that you 
no longer had to determine chlorinity by

10:18.328 --> 10:24.156
titration. and the appalling amount of ignorance 
has resulted from that.

10:33.715 --> 10:52.422
Now people, you know, they're no longer reading a 
burette, they're reading a meter and they're

10:33.715 --> 10:52.422
reading it to more figures and publishing these 
figures and it was kind of revealing during the IGY

10:33.715 --> 10:52.422
when two different groups ran selenometers on the 
same samples and they published them side by side

10:33.715 --> 10:52.422
and the results were appallingly unbearable. Do 
you think that it's been suggested that the great

10:54.106 --> 11:07.019
age of exploration has ended, in terms of 
oceanography, and that now may be a period of

10:54.106 --> 11:07.019
computation? Well, we're in the great age of 
exploration as regards to seafloor with the

11:07.059 --> 11:12.904
deep-sea drilling project. We have by no means 
wiped that up yet. There's a lot more going on. And

11:18.770 --> 11:23.775
of course, the breakthrough on development plate 
tectonics and the, finally people are willing to

11:24.127 --> 11:30.982
admit that there's such a thing as continental 
drift. That occurred in the early 1960s and that

11:31.002 --> 11:35.192
was another great breakthrough. I'll tell you a 
little anecdote about that. A guy named Mason out

11:38.580 --> 11:43.671
at Scripps, an Englishman, wanted to do just a 
bunch of routine magnetometer surveys of the

11:44.562 --> 12:13.506
ocean, and Scripps couldn't give him the ship 
time, but he found out that the Coast Survey was

11:44.562 --> 12:13.506
commissioning a ship, I think it was called the 
Pioneer, and that the time was being paid for by the

11:44.562 --> 12:13.506
Navy, so he cut together with Roger Revell to see if 
he couldn't have his magnetometer towed by this

11:44.562 --> 12:13.506
Coast and Genetic Survey vessel, and Roger got a 
hold of me, and I went on into our I dragged her fur

12:13.857 --> 12:19.422
and got down on my knees and said, let's put this in 
the operation plan for the pioneer to tow this

12:13.857 --> 12:19.422
magnetometer. And the captain said, yes, but the 
first time this interferes with the other vital

12:20.403 --> 12:27.729
things, they'll have orders to cut it away. And I 
said, well, that's all right. We'll put that in the

12:29.331 --> 12:30.232
orders. And of course, these guys in the co-survey 
are too smart to cut away a magnetometer. They'd

12:33.975 --> 12:35.316
hold it in whenever there was trouble. And they 
produced the detailed bathymetry and the

12:36.037 --> 12:43.003
detailed magnetic data that convinced people 
that this was a good way to go to keep continuing

12:43.372 --> 13:06.981
these studies and this led to the work of mine and so 
on on the

12:43.372 --> 13:06.981
fractionation, fracture of the sea floor along 
the mid-ocean ridges and led to this tremendous

12:43.372 --> 13:06.981
breakthrough in the understanding of plate 
tectonics and so I take a little bit of credit for

12:43.372 --> 13:06.981
being one link in the chain that they got this thing 
underway. Or does it strike you that in science

13:07.122 --> 13:11.447
many things like this seem almost accidental? 
Sure.

13:15.502 --> 13:25.475
Which is, it seems as if your discipline is 
swinging away from the idea of basic research and

13:15.502 --> 13:25.475
more and more specific research. Do you think 
these accidental discoveries will begin to

13:25.495 --> 13:30.621
diminish when this occurs? No, no. These things 
keep turning up. They discovered the equatorial

13:34.005 --> 13:40.834
undercurrent by fishing for

13:43.075 --> 14:06.568
whatever they were fishing for and finding that 
the fishing lines were trailing in strange ways

13:43.075 --> 14:06.568
and they developed the New England swordfish 
fishery on the basis of going out just to, Frank

13:43.075 --> 14:06.568
Mather wanted to catch a few fish and borrowed this 
long line gear from the Bureau of Commercial

13:43.075 --> 14:06.568
Fisheries and the man broke a leg so they left the 
gear overnight, landed the man to sent to the

14:06.886 --> 14:10.912
hospital, went back and picked it up and found that 
it was loaded with, with swordfish. The way to

14:11.012 --> 14:14.117
catch swordfish was to set long lines for them 
overnight. That led to the big swordfish industry

14:14.137 --> 14:29.081
in New England and that in turn was killed when some 
guy, some graduate student invented a way of

14:14.137 --> 14:29.081
determining mercury with ten times more 
precision than they had in the past and he found

14:14.137 --> 14:29.081
that there was a hell of a lot of mercury in 
swordfish. An accidental discovery one way, an

14:29.461 --> 14:33.147
accidental discovery the other way. What about 
the computer? What's it going to do to your

14:37.364 --> 14:38.545
discipline?

14:41.408 --> 14:49.357
Well, certainly the use of a computer is a very 
expeditious way to handle large bodies of data. I

14:49.377 --> 14:56.304
think Walter Munk was one of the first guys to apply 
the computer to solving problems of physical

14:49.377 --> 14:56.304
oceanography. It's certainly simplified his 
analysis of wave and tide observations. someday

15:01.342 --> 15:11.835
every oceanographic observation that's ever 
been taken will be on a computer and you can

15:01.342 --> 15:11.835
interrogate the computer and ask how much has the 
climate changed in the last ten years in terms of

15:01.342 --> 15:11.835
temperatures at a given point. I don't think we're 
there yet. It's tremendously expensive, of

15:14.859 --> 15:19.484
course, but it's just the way to go. You seem to 
regret that people don't go to sea that much

15:21.607 --> 15:28.395
anymore in terms of oceanographic research or 
that the direction may be in maybe going that way.

15:29.823 --> 15:36.570
So many guys get seasick and then spend the rest of 
their career trying to design a buoy system so that

15:29.823 --> 15:36.570
they don't have to go out in person. On the other 
hand, you have all these scuba guys who think that

15:38.252 --> 15:46.781
the only way to find out anything is to go down 
themselves in scuba, which is alright. You can

15:46.801 --> 15:51.385
find out a limited amount of things in certain 
areas, but I don't think scuba is the answer. I

15:51.425 --> 15:53.247
don't think little submarines are the answer 
either. I think all these things contribute, but I

15:53.267 --> 15:56.931
think surface ships and Nansen bottles are going 
to be with us for a long, long time to come. Well, my

16:02.229 --> 16:05.254
next question, as a matter of fact, was what about 
undersea gear? Have these, has undersea gear's

16:05.755 --> 16:10.963
technological breakthrough changed the nature 
of oceanography? I don't think so. Look at the

16:12.825 --> 16:14.708
drift of the Ben Franklin, for example. This was 
given a vast amount of publicity by Grumman as a

16:14.748 --> 16:18.514
great breakthrough. End of the trip, but... They 
had virtually nothing to show for it, and they gave

16:21.970 --> 16:24.854
the thing away. It cost them $4 million, and they 
gave it away for $25,000. So you think that at least

16:29.500 --> 16:40.475
in the way you perceive the future, guys will still 
go to the sea in ships and still will do that manual

16:29.500 --> 16:40.475
labor and drag those cables and... Lower 
enantiobottles on a wire. Nobody had us figure out

16:40.515 --> 16:44.821
how to do chemistry in deep water except by 
lowering an enantiobottle on a wire. Now,

16:46.663 --> 16:51.910
finally, if you had to sum up what you assumed were 
your accomplishments... in a long career of

16:52.210 --> 16:55.875
oceanography, what would you cite for yourself?

16:59.840 --> 17:18.825
Well, I helped build up the Division of 
Oceanography at the Hydrographic Office into a

16:59.840 --> 17:18.825
fairly competent organization with people who 
could react quickly to solve the Navy's immediate

16:59.840 --> 17:18.825
requirements in oceanographic information.

17:20.527 --> 17:27.013
In NSF, I launched a few ships and built a few 
buildings that are, I think, still serving. The

17:27.514 --> 17:30.216
buildings, at least, are serving their purpose. I 
think most of the ships now have been superseded.

17:37.383 --> 17:38.043
And that's about all. It's your time now. What 
would you like to say about oceanography, to be

17:43.528 --> 17:47.412
remembered, that I didn't ask you?

17:53.045 --> 17:56.069
Well, I always like to bring up Henry B. Bigelow. I 
think he's one of the most neglected figures in the

17:56.089 --> 18:00.335
history of American oceanography. When I was last 
with the government, I tried hard to get him one of

18:01.797 --> 18:09.748
the President's Science Medals before he died, 
and I was unsuccessful. One year, it was because

18:09.789 --> 18:20.824
the guy in the Department of Interior, who could 
have been most instrumental in pushing this,

18:09.789 --> 18:20.824
wanted to get the medal himself. And I did get him 
the Compass Award from the publishers of Undersea

18:21.715 --> 18:28.825
Technology in one year. Unfortunately, by that 
time he was too old and feeble to accept the award in

18:29.666 --> 18:35.694
person, and Qualify had to appear for him. But 
Henry Bigelow certainly is the father of American

18:38.298 --> 18:49.613
oceanography, and he's one of the figures that has 
been most neglected.

18:49.998 --> 18:53.523
Who struck you in oceanography, whom you remember 
beside Bigelow with fondness? Oh, I've got all

18:55.906 --> 18:57.689
kinds of friends.

19:00.954 --> 19:05.440
Tommy Thompson at University of Washington was a 
wonderful guy.

19:08.324 --> 19:10.728
He was a real seagoing chemist. The guy I worked for 
at Scripps, Muhlberg, was a great guy in his way.

19:20.896 --> 19:24.341
F.G. Walton Smith at the University of Miami is a 
wonderful character. He's been a real

19:24.361 --> 19:31.091
entrepreneur in directing interest to the 
Florida area.

19:34.736 --> 19:42.287
Then there was a whole bunch of people who came out 
of Scripps at the end of the war, who now fill high

19:34.736 --> 19:42.287
positions around ocean and gravity 
institutions. Art Maxwell at ONR. Dale Leeper was

19:45.892 --> 19:50.278
at Texas, now is at Monterey.

19:52.351 --> 19:59.337
Wayne Burt was at Oregon where he really built that 
institution up from nothing in a remarkably short

19:52.351 --> 19:59.337
time.

20:08.925 --> 20:16.932
Gene Lafond is a character I've been associated 
with and I'm tremendously proud to have known

20:08.925 --> 20:16.932
because Gene had done a lot of tremendous things in 
his day.

20:20.835 --> 20:21.936
Now, Just a couple of things while I've got the tape 
recorder running. Why was there opposition to

20:25.491 --> 20:29.154
Revelle coming back to head scripts?

20:33.638 --> 20:40.944
The opposition that he maintains came from 
Shepard and from...

20:40.964 --> 20:41.545
The fish man. The fish man, right. Yeah. Well, his 
name would come to me if I... Yeah, I'll think of it

20:44.788 --> 20:50.553
in a minute. Carl Hubs. Carl Hubs, right. Well, 
people have their own personal ambitions and

20:53.270 --> 21:03.389
people have their, have their, also their ideas 
about how the, how the organization should be

20:53.270 --> 21:03.389
structured. Many departments at universities 
like to have a week department head. They'll pick

21:09.358 --> 21:17.927
some fairly junior associate professor and put 
him in there for five years to handle the paperwork

21:09.358 --> 21:17.927
and to do what they tell him to do. The senior 
professors get together, they have their own

21:17.947 --> 21:25.415
caucus and they arrive at the decision and then 
they tell the department head what to tell the

21:17.947 --> 21:25.415
dean. Of course, you can't imagine Roger Revelle 
working that way. Roger is a strong man wherever he

21:30.340 --> 21:33.503
is and So naturally, the people who prefer this 
other kind of organization would not be happy

21:34.343 --> 21:42.480
about that. I can remember Roger's predecessor at 
Charter Scripps, Carl Eckert, telling me that two

21:55.100 --> 22:01.168
things that really led to his decision to retire as 
director and just go on being a professor. Of

22:01.208 --> 22:08.639
course, one of the beauties of the academic world 
is that you can quit a higher job than professor and

22:01.208 --> 22:08.639
you always get tenure as a professor. You can't do 
this necessarily in the Navy, but he had told one of

22:09.920 --> 22:16.990
the buildings and ground, and I think it was Carl 
Johnson, to do something. And Carl said, have you

22:20.820 --> 22:23.683
cleared this with Roger? And Carl said, I realized 
then that I was just a damn figurehead, that there

22:23.884 --> 22:34.016
was no point in my trying to be the director of 
script. And secondly, why did Monk not receive

22:34.036 --> 22:37.820
clearance? Was it because of his birthplace? 
Yeah. Monk and Swerder were both foreign born, you

22:42.466 --> 22:47.173
see, and I don't think either one was a citizen. I 
don't think Swerder was a citizen then. And in 1940

22:49.616 --> 22:55.464
and 41 we had tremendous security problems.

22:57.988 --> 23:02.815
Swerder told me one time that he had been cleared of 
all charges except associating with Monk. And

23:04.016 --> 23:08.843
Monk was cleared of all charges except 
associating with Swerder. And it was Roger

23:08.863 --> 23:10.365
Revelle who finally who finally straightened 
that one out and got them clearances and it

23:10.666 --> 23:27.919
certainly was to the benefit of the Navy that they 
did this because a whole lot of guys have been

23:10.666 --> 23:27.919
drowned on beaches and nothing for the fact that 
it's right over the bunker for working for the

23:10.666 --> 23:27.919
Navy.

23:27.939 --> 23:30.283
Nothing else I want to know unless you want to add 
something. I can't do anything this minute. Okay.
