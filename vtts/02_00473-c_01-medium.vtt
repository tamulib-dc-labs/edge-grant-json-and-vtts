WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:11.669
Do you remember what you thought about all the 
problems between, well, inter-service rivalry

00:01.432 --> 00:11.669
was basically what we're talking about, wasn't 
it? Well, at that time, why you're so low-ranking

00:12.891 --> 00:23.129
and so far away, why you really doesn't, it doesn't 
bother you at all. It's being a second lieutenant

00:23.289 --> 00:27.456
in Hawaii and and something that's happened at 
Langley Field or off of Langley Field. I think it's

00:35.473 --> 00:47.487
just like a young child, things like that just get 
so far away it really doesn't attract a lot of

00:35.473 --> 00:47.487
attention. Because you were busy in a squadron and 
you had all kinds of squadron jobs and community I

00:56.039 --> 01:04.069
was system BX officer, base exchange officer, and 
system mess officer, and communications

00:56.039 --> 01:04.069
officer. I don't really, at the time, really was 
impressed. Okay, this is also during the 1930s,

01:12.839 --> 01:17.625
Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. You had said 
that you were happy that you had a job, but then

01:19.106 --> 01:24.713
again you must have gone off the base. in Texas, 
also in Illinois, and you must have seen some

01:25.385 --> 01:32.357
poverty and some misery. Did the New Deal have any 
impact on you at all or any of Roosevelt's

01:33.198 --> 01:38.126
programs? Did you ever think about those? Were you 
political? No. No, in fact

01:44.417 --> 01:50.447
the first time I voted I guess was

01:57.194 --> 01:58.796
I don't know, I think probably 63. Because you 
were, well you were a resident of Texas and you

02:00.559 --> 02:07.107
always were stationed there. Now other than 
having a pay cut of 10 percent, it didn't really

02:07.708 --> 02:18.703
affect you because you were in the valley. We were 
in Hawaii, I was in Hawaii in four to thirty-six and

02:23.097 --> 02:50.607
then from thirty-six to forty you were, I was at 
Chinook Field in Illinois and you lived in the

02:23.097 --> 02:50.607
small town of Paxton, Illinois and you lived in

02:23.097 --> 02:50.607
Hawaii and you really didn't come in contact with 
any poverty and your parents were farmers and

02:51.380 --> 03:02.094
really it didn't seem that they were living any 
differently than when you were home, when I was

02:51.380 --> 03:02.094
home. Because you still had, they still had plenty 
to eat and so it really wasn't impressive. Okay,

03:14.971 --> 03:24.722
I'm wondering about why you decided to become 
interested in the bombers instead of the

03:14.971 --> 03:24.722
fighters? Or is that the military's decision? 
Well, that was a recommendation of your

03:26.484 --> 03:37.317
instructors and primaries and advanced over in at 
Randolph. I guess it's a matter of size, physical

03:40.158 --> 03:52.133
size, and

03:40.158 --> 03:52.133
whether or not you were the wiry type or the relaxed 
type. If you were the wiry type, you probably would

03:52.273 --> 04:01.384
be better in fighters. But being relatively easy 
going. Well, I guess bombers, I was very happy with

04:07.890 --> 04:13.856
bombers. And what bombers did you learn? Well, we 
had to be for the Keystone bomber and then we had a

04:16.199 --> 04:35.097
modern Martin bomber in Hawaii and then I came back 
to, well, Kelly when you had to transition about

04:16.199 --> 04:35.097
ten hours I think it fighters that had been in 
attack and observation. And of course when I flew

04:41.781 --> 04:54.493
the fighter, which was a little single engine 
aircraft, a Boeing P-12 I think it was, the crew

04:41.781 --> 04:54.493
chief almost ground me. I didn't think I'd touch 
the wing, but on the first time I flew the thing, and

04:54.653 --> 05:03.582
the crew chief came out and and rocked it up and down 
to the crack spar. So the next time I got in a fighter

05:07.942 --> 05:14.552
was at Chanute, I reported in there from Hawaii. 
And a guy named Spivey was operations officer and

05:16.155 --> 05:30.418
he pointed to a P-12 out there and said, you know 
you've had about three months at route or two

05:16.155 --> 05:30.418
months at route so you're behind and you're 
flying. So he said, you fly that thing for fifteen

05:31.625 --> 05:33.808
hours. Well, not all at the same time, so I was very 
leery of that fighter because last time I'd been in

05:33.928 --> 05:43.740
it, I'd had an accident. But anyway, I flew it and 
was very careful, and I didn't have any problems

05:43.760 --> 05:49.867
with it. So while you were at Chinook, you flew 
everything. You flew bombers, you had a B-18,

05:52.010 --> 05:59.539
Douglas, I guess it was made that, and you had 
fighters and you had observation planes. And

06:05.673 --> 06:08.236
moved to Scott, you did the same thing. You flew 
almost everything. What did you think of the

06:10.139 --> 06:14.205
training in the Army Air Force? Well, I was part of 
it. I spent nine years in the technical training

06:15.506 --> 06:21.214
field. As a second lieutenant, what did you think 
of the quality of the training? I mean, were they

06:23.918 --> 06:25.921
good instructors? Well, when you As a second 
lieutenant I reported to Luke Field of Wire, and

06:30.333 --> 06:38.685
then of course you had a major as a commander. And I 
would say that one of the most important phases of

06:38.705 --> 06:49.841
an officer's life is who he has as a commander. When 
he reports in, how much interest the commander has

06:49.962 --> 06:58.534
in you as an individual. and his personality and 
the interest he takes in your career. And then you

07:06.064 --> 07:15.595
have more senior officers, captains and first 
lieutenants who guide you around. You become

07:15.655 --> 07:17.097
their wingman. So I'd say it's really high caliber 
in

07:19.259 --> 07:24.946
time. I mean the general Major Edwards, who later 
became a lieutenant general, was my squaring

07:27.387 --> 07:40.603
commander, and of course he would call me by my 
first name, and he was very interested. And when I

07:41.264 --> 07:49.273
went to Chanute, to a technical school, he said, 
now Tex, go up there and don't study, just pass.

07:49.313 --> 07:50.195
That's all you have to do. You don't want to be kept 
there as an instructor, because that's the worst

07:50.375 --> 07:56.382
thing that could happen to you, is to stay there as 
an instructor. Well, I couldn't do that so when I

07:56.783 --> 08:09.654
reported in I became the base exchange officer 
until school started and that was about eight

07:56.783 --> 08:09.654
months ahead of time. And then of course everybody 
gets to know you and then I stayed there as an

08:11.015 --> 08:26.368
instructor and then from there I became assistant

08:11.015 --> 08:26.368
director and then finally director of the 
technical school. And I liked that. In fact, from

08:28.283 --> 08:34.109
that time on, mostly I was a boss. And I liked being 
boss. You liked the education, the service school

08:37.753 --> 08:41.297
aspect of the military. What did you like about it? 
Well, I mean, it's a broadening type of thing. And

08:47.444 --> 08:55.613
the other thing is you get a lot of management 
training.

08:56.791 --> 09:02.960
And actually the military is a very efficient 
running operation. And so you have,

09:04.322 --> 09:19.202
well my thesis,

09:04.322 --> 09:19.202
my master's thesis is based on career development 
of Air Force officers. And

09:19.323 --> 09:26.072
I thought the Air Force did a pretty good job for me. 
they sent me to technical school. I went to, came to

09:29.597 --> 09:42.117
Randolph to learn how to fly an airplane on 
instruments, or blind flying as they call it. And

09:43.799 --> 09:52.914
developed the link trainer, the link trainer 
programs. So you had a lot of of time and

09:55.313 --> 10:00.140
opportunity to develop yourself. Sure. And then I 
went to Scott and we moved the radio school from

10:01.282 --> 10:19.448
Chinook to Scott and then I was selected to go to 
Sioux Falls, South Dakota and I was a lieutenant

10:01.282 --> 10:19.448
colonel at the time and I got a bunch of mostly 
second lieutenants. And about sixty percent of

10:25.379 --> 10:34.828
them were sergeants who were given direct 
commissions as second lieutenants. So you have

10:34.848 --> 10:45.159
yourself as lieutenant colonel and you have a 
bunch of second lieutenants to organize and run a

10:34.848 --> 10:45.159
school and it was just a lot of fun.

10:47.822 --> 10:51.105
And we organized it and started built a school from 
a piece of cornfield

10:52.402 --> 11:07.484
to a capacity of about 10,000 students in one year. 
That

11:07.564 --> 11:12.931
I like pretty well. I didn't really like staff 
work. I moved from there to technical training

11:14.994 --> 11:19.000
command at Goldwood Field, North Carolina. and 
then from there the headquarters training

11:20.212 --> 11:22.415
command. I was at my best when I was out by myself. 
When you were developing your own programs? When I

11:30.526 --> 11:32.869
was developing my own programs and this type of 
thing. Well what happened to the idea of getting in

11:33.350 --> 11:35.934
the engineer corps? Well I said the Air Force got 
into your blood so you were, you just dropped that

11:36.755 --> 11:48.531
because,

11:36.755 --> 11:48.531
see, in 36 You learn to fly and I love flying. Okay. 
Tell me about your, you were the assistant

11:55.012 --> 12:01.077
director of radio technical school 1939 to 1942.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.603
What were your duties there? What does it mean 
assistant director? Well, you had, well I think I

12:09.365 --> 12:16.071
was about second command. I had Lud Bryan who was 
who was the director and then I had myself and then I

12:19.409 --> 12:28.540
had Charlie Richards who was a senior civilian 
instructor. And your job then was primarily

12:28.560 --> 12:39.192
developing expansion programs to take care of the 
expanding Air Force. And so you were

12:39.953 --> 12:47.121
going around, well at one time We were going to set 
up a colored technical school, and I reported to

12:47.894 --> 13:04.022
the governor of Alabama's office at the time to get 
secret instructions. So, the three of us searched

13:04.803 --> 13:11.455
the southeast for some school to to set up a 
technical school. So we went to Howard University

13:17.033 --> 13:21.920
in Atlanta, I think it is. And we thought it was a- 
Fisk in Atlanta? Huh? Fisk in Atlanta? No, it was

13:25.305 --> 13:26.146
Howard. Howard in Washington, D.C. isn't it? No, 
that's a color school. There is a Howard

13:29.230 --> 13:31.914
University down south someplace. Oh, okay. So we 
went to it first because we thought it was a color

13:32.134 --> 13:37.903
school. Well, it turned out to be a white school. So 
they didn't- take to that very much. And after

13:46.437 --> 13:56.447
visiting Emory University, we went to Tuskegee, 
and that's where the school was finally

13:46.437 --> 13:56.447
established. And

13:56.487 --> 14:08.778
then we did a lot of planning on expanding the 
technical schools. We opened one at Sioux Falls,

14:08.818 --> 14:12.762
South Dakota, one in Madison, Wisconsin, one at 
Scott and

14:13.687 --> 14:28.710
one in Chicago, in one of the hotels, we took over 
one of the big hotels in Chicago. And then we

14:29.872 --> 14:42.411
selected instructors out of the graduating 
classes and we took a cadre to Sioux Falls and

14:29.872 --> 14:42.411
somebody else took a cadre to Madison, Wisconsin, 
and another cadre, another individual took a

14:42.712 --> 14:51.563
cadre to Chicago. And then you start training 
students at Scott. And you're training second

14:59.674 --> 15:02.418
lieutenants then? No. Or were you training 
enlisted men? No, what you were training was

15:06.182 --> 15:08.465
enlisted men. What you were doing, it was quite 
easy. So you were getting, well, starting in 1940,

15:12.209 --> 15:20.439
you started getting a lot of people into the 
service. And we had the authority to select X

15:21.821 --> 15:29.010
number of students out of the classes. So you'd get 
these college graduates to be coming through as

15:29.030 --> 15:35.699
radio students, and you'd just pick them up. Some 
of them, sometimes they were instructors, and had

15:35.999 --> 15:42.047
been teachers or something of this sort. And so you 
pull them out of the line. And we established a

15:48.988 --> 15:57.563
course for Chinese at Scott. And so we went up to 
Chicago to the

15:57.583 --> 16:05.757
Chinese

16:07.492 --> 16:12.859
up there, and we had found a Chinese who had his 
master's degree in electrical engineering.

16:12.999 --> 16:13.800
Perfect. He could also speak the language of the 
Canton, the Cantonese, or whatever it is that all

16:14.040 --> 16:22.931
our Steelers were going to be. And so we got hired 
him, brought him down, trained him, started

16:22.991 --> 16:27.697
training him. Chinese wouldn't, they said, we 
want to be trained by Chinese. We would have stayed

16:30.721 --> 16:34.225
in Japan and China. We wanted to be trained by 
Americans, so we had to

16:34.846 --> 16:43.997
get Mr. Depew, who was one of our senior 
instructors. He would speak to them in English,

16:44.117 --> 16:51.606
and the same electrical engineer would interpret 
what the guy said. Strange. But anyway, you got

16:55.390 --> 16:57.272
into cars too. So what you were doing is setting up 
training schools for radio men? Radio, yeah.

17:02.639 --> 17:04.701
Radio mechanics and radio operators. The fly-in 
bombers and other aircraft? The fly-in bombers

17:07.195 --> 17:14.523
and ground, take care of ground stations and all 
that type of thing. How long was the course?

17:16.986 --> 17:17.787
Sixteen weeks. Sixteen weeks. Sixteen weeks, 
normally for both the operator and the mechanic. I

17:23.713 --> 17:28.799
bet your enrollment soared from the early 1940s 
when we went into the war. Well, at Sioux Falls,

17:28.959 --> 17:34.165
South Dakota,

17:34.600 --> 17:37.965
Enrolled 850 every week. Wow. 850 every week. 
That's

17:41.190 --> 17:45.656
incredible. And you had to process them in and 
process them out. And then of course we became

17:50.823 --> 18:03.021
known as the best radio school in the Air Force, Air 
Corps, because We would select our graduates as to

18:04.874 --> 18:08.438
where they would go. I mean, with SAC or the 
bombardment people in the Second Air Force who

18:08.458 --> 18:25.419
were training cadres for overseas, if they're in 
bombardment, we selected the best radio

18:08.458 --> 18:25.419
operators and sent them. If they got a quarter of 50 
out of the class, our first best operator would go

18:26.079 --> 18:32.367
to them. And it backfired on us because then

18:33.005 --> 18:44.602
the commander of the guys that would run these 
cadres wanted all our students. Well if they got

18:44.802 --> 18:50.811
all our students they got like everybody else was 
sending them. So we kind of backed off on that one

18:51.371 --> 18:59.383
and after I got to school And of course when we went 
up Sioux Falls we went out and hired a bunch of

18:59.954 --> 19:05.603
school teachers. We hired a tremendous number of 
school teachers. Women who were teaching school

19:10.711 --> 19:25.354
and brought them in, taught them radio and then 
they already had teaching methods and knew how to

19:10.711 --> 19:25.354
teach, how to handle students.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.364
And so they turned out real well. Were they 
civilian status? They were civilian, yeah. And at

19:33.611 --> 19:47.511
that time you had to, we got directives to hire X 
number of colored, X number of Chinese and

19:33.611 --> 19:47.511
minority groups, even in 42. And I never had- To 
hire them as instructors? As instructors, yeah.

19:56.367 --> 20:03.075
And I never had any problem because I think you have 
problems when you start talking about a problem. I

20:03.095 --> 20:16.090
mean, I just, some of the schools, they segregated 
the southern boys from the northern boys and put

20:03.095 --> 20:16.090
them in the colored instructor's classes. And I 
said, no, we'll just put everybody in the,

20:16.130 --> 20:22.278
wherever they fall, that's where they're going to 
fall. So we didn't talk about it. And normally the

20:24.768 --> 20:30.914
colored instructors were the best anyway. 
Really? Why is that? Why do you say that? Well, you

20:33.357 --> 20:35.259
only hired the very best. I see. See, I mean, you had 
instructors that you were pulling out of the

20:35.919 --> 20:42.105
graduating classes. Some of them were just a high 
school graduate. But here, the colored boys, the

20:44.708 --> 20:50.934
colored instructors you were hiring, all of them 
had their degree from college. Some of them had

20:50.954 --> 20:52.716
their master's degree from college. So they were 
better anyway. So we never had any problem. Never

20:58.820 --> 21:00.422
had any problem whatsoever. No kidding? There was 
no, I mean. No. You didn't have very many, you

21:04.486 --> 21:12.774
didn't have any colored students going through 
because at that time they were all sent to

21:04.486 --> 21:12.774
Tuskegee.

21:14.375 --> 21:21.522
Whereas you also, we had set up a system that every 
two weeks you wash a student back so that you could

21:21.755 --> 21:30.104
take all levels of intelligence. We had an army 
general classification test that you could

21:30.444 --> 21:49.243
predict to almost to the percentage point that 
would graduate on time and which one would take

21:30.444 --> 21:49.243
twice as long to get through school or what have 
you. We set up a system so that every two weeks we'd

21:51.488 --> 21:52.389
wash them back. And if they failed, we'd just wash 
them back and then they'd go through. And if they

21:56.295 --> 21:58.237
failed again, we'd wash them back again. And we 
just kept them in school. And

22:01.442 --> 22:13.719
the Army General Classification Test, I'm a great 
believer in your aptitude test. I just think it

22:13.839 --> 22:18.205
shows, because we We had thousands upon thousands 
of students going through the technical systems

22:19.045 --> 22:36.034
and we had IBM grading cards and established the 
exams so that they were equal exams. One class

22:36.595 --> 22:44.749
didn't get a harder exam than another so you had 
maybe three or four different exams.

22:46.754 --> 22:52.623
And you could tell when a guy enters almost when 
he's going to graduate. But once they learned it,

22:52.703 --> 22:57.390
most of them were good at that. I mean, they could be 
there to be just as good an operator as the guy who

22:58.251 --> 23:05.021
went through it the first time around. So I think 
that our school system

23:16.538 --> 23:18.020
should watch some of these boys back. But I don't 
get any children back, but again you get into

23:18.040 --> 23:36.048
social problems of where a guy 14 is in the 8th grade 
or 6th grade and so he falls out, he drops out. I

23:37.150 --> 23:38.732
don't know what the answer is. Well, it seems to me 
then, let's get the record straight. You had women

23:45.413 --> 23:53.751
instructors and you had black instructors and 
these were civilians and you had regular military

23:54.490 --> 23:55.091
Instructors. Instructors. Were they officers or 
enlisted men? They were enlisted men mostly. They

23:58.575 --> 23:59.516
were enlisted men. Yeah. Okay, you were training 
enlisted men to become radio instructors and you

24:00.157 --> 24:11.612
really didn't have any problems with the women or 
the blacks or any of your instructors and the

24:00.157 --> 24:11.612
relationship that they had with the men. Is that 
true? No. Well, You always have a problem when you

24:16.023 --> 24:20.251
get girls mixed up with boys. Oh, you mean in other 
words, you said that you had no problems between

24:20.331 --> 24:26.824
the whites and the blacks. No. But you did have 
problems with the women and students. I would say

24:30.792 --> 24:35.140
that there were military problems. I think there 
were.

24:42.770 --> 24:49.919
Well, I think you have a sex problem where you get 
the opposite sex together. And every once in a

24:50.079 --> 25:06.881
while, you would have

24:50.079 --> 25:06.881
whether some girl inspector or female inspector 
would be in some men's barracks or something of

24:50.079 --> 25:06.881
this sort. But it wasn't a major problem.

25:11.677 --> 25:15.160
Because most of the part they were very, very good. 
And they were very, very conscientious and they

25:16.381 --> 25:20.325
thought they were doing their job. I mean, doing 
their job for the service. And we had quite a few of

25:22.466 --> 25:26.310
them. I would say about a third of our instructors 
were women. And how many, what percentage were

25:30.073 --> 25:31.955
black? Oh, maybe three or four, not very many. 
Three or four percent? Yeah, three or four, yeah.

25:37.239 --> 25:38.821
And how many instructors did you have? Oh, maybe 
I'd say about 400. And this is just up at Sioux

25:41.528 --> 25:43.731
Falls? Yeah, up at Sioux Falls. Okay, now you were 
the director of radar and radio, and this is

25:45.133 --> 25:51.804
technical schools, and this was at Sioux Falls? 
Yeah, it was a radio school. It was pure and simple a

25:53.005 --> 25:54.788
radio school. Why did they call it radar and radio 
technical school then? Well, see, we

25:58.694 --> 26:05.925
established—see, I think I'd gone over to 
England.

26:08.830 --> 26:09.831
We had a radar school established at Scott,

26:10.418 --> 26:18.049
which was what we call a pathfinder. There was a 
radar bombing school. I took a trip after I left

26:21.353 --> 26:28.323
Sioux Falls and got to the headquarters of 
Technical Training Command in Fort Worth. I took a

26:29.525 --> 26:38.738
90 day tour of England to study the radar systems 
and air-sea rescue systems and how our students

26:39.410 --> 26:44.538
were doing. And when I got back, I went down to Boca 
Raton, Florida to run a radar school. Oh, I see. The

26:51.790 --> 26:53.814
radar was separate from the radio. Okay, then you 
were at Sioux Falls from, could you tell me what

26:53.834 --> 26:58.181
years then you were there as the director? 42 to 43. 
Okay, okay. So in 42 to 43 you were the director of

27:00.525 --> 27:04.371
the radio school up at... At Sioux Falls and then 44 
and 43 to 45, you were the director of the radar

27:04.874 --> 27:14.248
school down in Florida. OK, well, were there 
differences? Were there different scopes or

27:18.414 --> 27:23.561
different problems that you had at these two 
schools? Well, see, at the radio schools, we had

27:23.862 --> 27:34.577
established a system so that if you're going to 
talk about a spoon, everybody would have a spoon in

27:23.862 --> 27:34.577
his hand. If you're talking about a glass, if 
you're talking about a radio tube, well everybody

27:34.861 --> 27:42.350
would have a tube in his hand. So that your method of 
instruction was very, very practical.

27:53.745 --> 28:04.058
So when that idea was put out by General Weaver, 
then we grabbed it and ran with it up to Sioux Falls,

27:53.745 --> 28:04.058
South Dakota. Now down at Keesler, it was an 
airplane mechanics school, and then after I got to

28:04.898 --> 28:22.204
his headquarters at Norwood Field, we went down 
there one time and they were still teaching the

28:04.898 --> 28:22.204
same theoretical. I mean they were gum beating is 
what I'd call it, up before blackboard. So it was a

28:27.882 --> 28:32.729
practical application in Sioux Falls with a radio 
school. With a radar school, it was theoretical.

28:35.352 --> 28:38.016
Getting to the mechanical school. So we were 
ordered, well, we spent the night there, and he

28:38.637 --> 28:48.991
ordered every chair out of every classroom

28:38.637 --> 28:48.991
to be piled up outside. And then the next day he went 
back, and all the students were standing up. And so

28:55.319 --> 28:57.282
that's how he got... the mechanical school on a 
practical basis. His idea was that if a guy was

29:01.021 --> 29:11.271
learning about engines, then he had to have an 
engine to work on. And if he unscrewed a nut off of an

29:11.711 --> 29:16.516
engine, well then he'd lay it down here. That was 
nut number one. That nut would be number two. And

29:21.341 --> 29:26.146
then when that nut went back on, it went back on the 
same thread as it came off of. Now this is kind of

29:26.166 --> 29:27.707
ridiculous, But anyway, so after

29:28.244 --> 29:37.617
that, why that became practical? Well, the radar 
school was the most difficult to get into a

29:37.657 --> 29:44.606
practical method of instruction. And I was sent 
down to Boca Time, Florida to change it from a

29:45.447 --> 29:54.319
theoretical school to a practical school. And you 
had just returned from England? I had just

29:56.483 --> 30:10.682
returned from England to find out that our radar 
students were very good theorists, but they had

29:56.483 --> 30:10.682
never seen the equipment before. So I went down 
there. You mean your radar instructors? No, the

30:14.066 --> 30:17.010
radar students who were being graduated. They 
knew the theory, but they didn't know how to work on

30:17.771 --> 30:24.120
the equipment. You're only out selecting me, and I 
went down there to make this into a practical

30:24.607 --> 30:29.914
school. And of course, you get into the situation 
that you're the boss, but all the people who work

30:31.155 --> 30:39.646
there are theorists. And they just say, Colonel, 
there's no way of doing it that way.

30:47.016 --> 30:50.020
And I say, well, there must be some way. So I started 
selecting the the

30:53.513 --> 31:11.725
combat crew officers, people who had gone to 
England and completed their 30 missions or 50

30:53.513 --> 31:11.725
missions, whatever it was, and had come back to the 
States, and most of them were college graduates,

31:12.498 --> 31:17.927
So we put them through the radar school, and I 
started selecting them off the base. And then

31:17.947 --> 31:23.197
every time a guy would say he can't do it, I would 
say, I would put him on the shipping order. Next

31:23.217 --> 31:26.963
time I get a directive to ship a radar officer off, 
I'd ship him.
