WEBVTT

00:05.296 --> 00:23.457
Thank

00:05.296 --> 00:23.457
you.

00:27.689 --> 00:31.252
to deliver the ball. And to deliver the ball by the 
lawless case, the lawless case, it simply said

00:31.452 --> 00:46.566
that here in the Congress, it was in the name of the 
National Congress. But the city of Manhattan, the

00:46.586 --> 00:53.973
National Congress being concerned at the time, 
was not going to put up with the meddling of the

00:46.586 --> 00:53.973
refugees at the state level. So the lawless case 
had the effect of doing away with not only the

00:53.993 --> 00:57.696
refugee laws, but the refugee movement as well. In 
the

00:57.676 --> 01:21.793
south of the Midwest.

01:22.634 --> 01:27.120
And, of course, the Department's alliance . And in 
1892, the Department's alliance, at least two

01:27.901 --> 01:37.514
million members, came together in Omaha, 
Nebraska. And then they organized themselves

01:37.534 --> 01:40.258
into a national party. And they were going to . He 
took a candidate

01:43.559 --> 01:57.157
to run against the Republican and Democratic 
candidates right here. So in 1892, going on out of

01:57.177 --> 02:01.522
Nebraska, farmers' alliance comes together, and 
their candidate is James Brewer. James Brewer

02:01.542 --> 02:03.365
made the populist candidate. The farmers' 
alliance, the farmers, now organize themselves

02:03.385 --> 02:09.613
into this political party, and they call it the 
political party, the populist party. The

02:12.076 --> 02:12.456
populist party. The candidate is James Brewer.

02:18.507 --> 02:29.721
What

02:18.507 --> 02:29.721
do you want to tell me? When I was teaching school in 
San Antonio, I had a little girl in my name by the

02:29.741 --> 02:38.592
name of Eileen Balinski. Smartest little thing 
that ever was. And I didn't connect Balinski with

02:41.416 --> 02:45.781
anything being a Jew. It just didn't. I knew where 
Belinsky's auction barn was out in the stockyards

02:46.604 --> 02:55.497
and everything, but it didn't.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.366
We were having a Christmas program. She said, Miss 
Ava, what kind of a program are we going to have for

03:01.386 --> 03:05.292
Christmas? I said, well, Eileen, what would you 
like to have? She says, let's have Christmas in all

03:08.176 --> 03:12.122
nations. I said, well, us being sixth graders, 
that's what we're studying, every nation under

03:12.642 --> 03:19.769
the globe, so why not? I said, that would be fine 
with me. She said, can I have Israel? I said, sure.

03:29.739 --> 03:31.861
That's what you want. And one little boy come 
running up to me, and he said, can I have Austria? I

03:40.249 --> 03:41.130
said, sure. And, you know, just one right after the 
other came and asked if they could have these and

03:41.313 --> 03:47.120
this and that. I had one little Mexican boy, and he 
wanted Mexico. And I said, sure. But I said, now I

03:52.086 --> 03:57.993
want your children to be sure and ask your parents 
if this is all right when you start out. Because let

03:58.594 --> 04:04.080
me tell you, when we start this program, there is no 
two options. nations in the world that celebrate

04:04.246 --> 04:12.035
Christmas at Christmas time, like the Americans 
do. Well, their eyes got big as dollars. They

04:14.698 --> 04:15.439
didn't know. And I said, now, not everybody 
celebrates Christmas as December the 26th. And I

04:22.887 --> 04:24.850
said, you're going to have to tell them why. You 
celebrate Christmas at a certain time. And you'll

04:28.213 --> 04:34.000
be dressed in your costumes, and you'll tell of 
your foods, and you'll tell of your customs. Well,

04:34.587 --> 04:40.535
that just tickled them to death, but they all 
thought it would be December the 26th, 25th.

04:41.937 --> 05:02.805
Finally, when they come to find out, and we got into 
it, and we got to working with it, and found out the

04:41.937 --> 05:02.805
different times that Christmas was always served 
and everything, we got through this little Eileen

04:41.937 --> 05:02.805
Balinski had brought some lemon bread with her. 
and for everyone to see and to taste. And they

05:07.865 --> 05:26.281
looked at one another, and the little boy from 
Greek brought, I know, I cannot tell you the name of

05:07.865 --> 05:26.281
the food, but it was wrapped in grape leaves, and it 
was delicious. But he brought it, and we tasted it.

05:29.124 --> 05:32.607
In fact, every country had brought something of 
their own thing. And when it was all put on the table

05:35.684 --> 05:47.420
and was served, little Eileen Balinski got up, and 
she had a package in her hand. And she says, this is

05:47.580 --> 05:59.016
for a teacher that has meant more to me than any 
teacher I've had since I started this school in the

05:47.580 --> 05:59.016
sixth grade. I opened it up. She says, I want you to 
open it up and show the class. And it was, she had had

06:04.265 --> 06:14.819
a tree planted in my memory in the forest in 
Jerusalem. How beautiful. How beautiful. That's

06:17.002 --> 06:22.229
the most wonderful thing that I can think of that 
could have happened to me. A tree planted in my

06:22.290 --> 06:24.092
memory. And I want that. I want a photostatic copy 
of this thing. In the book. And I want it in the book.

06:30.299 --> 06:30.860
It will be. Because, you know, they don't do things 
unless they love you. They don't do things like

06:37.275 --> 06:40.984
that unless they have respect for you. And then is 
when I began to find out or go back and look to see.

06:47.009 --> 06:48.351
About your grandfather Chapman? My grandfather 
Chapman, all the things that he had told me that I

06:48.371 --> 06:52.878
didn't know that was. That you were Jewish. That I 
even had NG blood in me. Right. And I found that out

06:59.247 --> 07:00.849
right quick. Isn't that nice? Yes, it was nice. 
Yeah. But I didn't know it. I didn't know it when she

07:05.175 --> 07:07.678
gave it to me. And I didn't know it until it has been 
over. Well, I would say it hasn't been over eight

07:12.807 --> 07:19.141
years ago that I found my house. And I traced it down 
and found out this is how it all came about. And I

07:24.890 --> 07:27.673
told Kitty Clyde, and she was as shocked as I was. 
Because she's your cousin, right? First cousin,

07:29.235 --> 07:34.640
and she didn't know anything about it. I love it. 
Poor Kitty Clyde and her Methodism. Yeah. That's

07:40.827 --> 07:42.448
bad business. Yeah, I know. In Texas, it is. But I 
can think back. I've had a lot of good background

07:47.513 --> 07:53.800
religious training, not knowing where it came 
from. Well, I have. I know you have. And it

07:56.664 --> 08:00.629
certainly stems from the Jewish faith. From your 
grandfather. From my grandfather. I never know

08:02.852 --> 08:03.653
him. Very adamant about it. I never mention it that 
I know

08:06.377 --> 08:12.224
of, ever. Because he was separated from them. 
Yeah. And we had no connection with them

08:15.248 --> 08:17.592
whatsoever. It was very isolated in Texas. And 
very isolated. But I know one thing. When we went to

08:24.337 --> 08:29.905
buy something, we went to Gilliman's, and we went 
to Joe Cohen. So you know what that meant, don't

08:30.706 --> 08:33.470
you? Your grandfather patronized. That's right, 
and he knew exactly where to go, and we got the best

08:35.333 --> 08:41.162
of everything. I always did. I like that. But how? I 
don't know. That was good. My wedding ring was

08:48.221 --> 08:52.368
probably two coins. On 6th Street. I know where it

08:53.470 --> 08:58.459
is. Isn't that something? One of those things. It 
sure is. Now, we've had post oaks, and that's what

09:04.283 --> 09:09.671
these are, post oaks. We've had these and live 
oaks. You see these dying through here? That's

09:16.801 --> 09:23.951
some kind of a disease that's hitting these trees, 
and we've never had it in this part of the country.

09:23.971 --> 09:24.372
See that one? There's a dead one over yonder. We've 
never had that until the last couple of years. I

09:31.082 --> 09:34.206
don't know what the score is in this live oak. And I 
don't know. I just don't know what it is that's

09:36.320 --> 09:39.846
killing them. They say there's a blight that's 
going to destroy all the oak trees. Well, there

09:44.253 --> 09:47.198
sure are doing it fast.

09:50.083 --> 09:53.970
Now, that's what you call scrub cedar out there. 
And that's the type that we have now. When we get out

09:56.274 --> 09:57.696
here... Well, are we going by the ranch or going 
down to the Smith place? Oh, well, I guess we'll go

10:02.669 --> 10:05.762
with both of them. I was going to say, I want to show 
you some posts and that type of cedar that I was

10:06.130 --> 10:16.643
telling you about, the tall cedar that grows up and 
makes posts. In other words, they are cedar trees

10:16.844 --> 10:21.590
much like those around Bastrop. Yes. That type of 
cedar. Now, we had a good many of those along the

10:23.412 --> 10:32.003
rivers and creeks, but where this... Scrub cedar 
came from, I don't know. But anyway, we've got it.

10:37.671 --> 10:42.718
And the next thing we have is that's taken the 
country is that button willow. You see that right

10:42.738 --> 10:44.481
out there, that stuff? Is that what that's called? 
That's called button willow. Button willow. The

10:48.166 --> 10:51.351
Indians used those buttons for cough medicine. 
Oh, really? Yeah, it's down under the ground. The

10:55.156 --> 10:58.381
willow root, they'd dig it up and use it for that. 
They'd take the tops of those... and braid baskets

11:01.835 --> 11:24.012
and things but that's called button willow but and 
it sure is taking the country yeah i see that all

11:01.835 --> 11:24.012
over and i yeah i wondered see all along here sure 
and so the root has a bulb on it or uh-huh it has a

11:01.835 --> 11:24.012
little old button huh and you boil that or whatever 
for coffee they boil it up for cough medicine

11:30.623 --> 11:36.010
They put that, well, the Americans put that, well, 
they use honey. Uh-huh. That, boil that with honey

11:37.652 --> 11:49.608
and,

11:37.652 --> 11:49.608
well, if they got in town and could get any hooch or 
whiskey, that's what they put in it. Yeah. And the

11:50.349 --> 11:56.037
Americans used honey and alum and- Yeah. And 
hooch. Yeah.

12:05.943 --> 12:11.734
So it was just

12:05.943 --> 12:11.734
flat land, right? Just flat land with lots of 
grass, right? Yes, sir. You didn't have much of

12:16.223 --> 12:19.489
anything. And the persimmons have come into this 
country since 1940, a lot of them. Now, we had a few.

12:28.100 --> 12:32.985
persimmon trees in our day, back in the 20s on the 
ranch. That's that black persimmon, right? Yeah,

12:34.386 --> 12:36.648
that's the black persimmon. And there were few, 
but we didn't have a whole lot of them. But man

12:41.233 --> 12:48.800
alive,

12:41.233 --> 12:48.800
we've had algeritas a good long time. Now that's 
nice. But they didn't scatter so as they do now. I

12:55.426 --> 12:57.128
don't know why, but They just didn't take the 
country over. Yeah. We'd have a few but not too

13:01.086 --> 13:03.321
many.

13:09.292 --> 13:12.516
Well, it is a sign of the changing soils. Oh, I'll 
tell you one thing. The seasons have changed so

13:15.279 --> 13:17.561
much. Well, they have. Tell me. Until it's just not 
even like the same country. Well, let's talk about

13:23.808 --> 13:25.470
that. We just haven't had any. Well, we didn't have 
any. We went right from winter into summer this

13:31.116 --> 13:34.099
year. We didn't have any spring. Not whatsoever to 
speak of. It just went from winter to summer. And we

13:41.739 --> 13:46.230
haven't had as hot a summer as we had last year. Not 
nearly as hot. And

13:49.370 --> 13:58.003
I don't know what to think about fall because. 
That's right. I saw some red ones ready. And that's

14:02.631 --> 14:04.734
something unusual. What is that? Being red this 
time of the year. Is that so? What does that mean?

14:09.662 --> 14:11.665
They shouldn't be ripe so soon? They should have 
been ripe a long time ago. That? Yes, ma'am. Yes.

14:18.142 --> 14:19.044
Yes, ma'am. Well, those two I just saw were just as 
ripe and ready and... You want me to get out and

14:19.064 --> 14:24.958
catch that gate? Reckon you can hold me? Sure, I 
hope. I'll give it a try.

15:11.635 --> 15:14.038
So everything's sort of late this year, right? 
Yes, it is. It sure is.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.810
Now that we're on the... This is a road down to the El 
Rancho Escondido. El Rancho Escondido. That's it

15:30.000 --> 15:31.782
in the house. Now, look at those persimmons. They 
were ripe. Yeah, yeah. And these are not turning.

15:37.310 --> 15:38.111
No, they're not. Now, there's one. There's two 
ripe ones. Yeah, I see those ones. See them right up

15:41.335 --> 15:42.556
there? I sure do. Now, you'll see the deer feeding 
on those. You'll see deer feeding on those. And you

15:49.323 --> 15:54.429
can take those and plant them yourself. And 
they'll never come up. But after a deer or a turkey

15:57.032 --> 16:05.841
eats them and germinates them, they'll come up. 
And I think that's the reason we have so many of

16:06.192 --> 16:11.642
them, because on account of the deer and the 
turkey. Yeah, the deer population has just

16:12.483 --> 16:16.210
exploded. Yeah, that's contributing to a lot. Oh, 
more than anything. Cedar will not, cedarberry

16:21.559 --> 16:26.588
will not come up unless it's germinated. And you 
take the cedar robin and the goats, You turn a bunch

16:31.336 --> 16:38.797
of goats out in the morning, that'll be the first 
thing they'll do, is go and take a nip off of the

16:31.336 --> 16:38.797
cedar if there's any around. That's just like a, 
well, it's just like a dose of medicine for them.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.839
Stimulate them, whatnot. Uh-huh.

16:59.618 --> 17:07.189
I read an article the other day that was quite 
amusing about Ethiopia.

17:09.492 --> 17:17.765
We have very little geography on Ethiopia, and we 
have very little geography on my boy's rabbit. Oh,

17:18.225 --> 17:19.567
I thought it was, uh-huh. Something else. Yeah, 
he's a big one. Yeah. And it said that... Ethiopia

17:27.158 --> 17:32.626
had never been engaged in a war. Only within 
itself. It had natural barriers. It also said it

17:38.755 --> 17:45.865
was the oldest Jewish settlement in the world. 
That I didn't know. I thought Israel was. Then to

17:51.353 --> 17:54.077
please go back to Ethiopia.

17:56.183 --> 17:58.385
I was just reading about that the other day. I know 
that's where coffee was discovered in Ethiopia. I

18:03.690 --> 18:04.931
didn't know that. Yeah, I know that. I just don't 
know much about it, but I'm sure going to be reading

18:07.013 --> 18:11.657
about it. We'll have to open up another door, 
right? To an authority on Ethiopia. Well, I just

18:16.662 --> 18:22.187
really enjoy knowing different things. So do I. 
Yeah.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.462
You know your land. I'll tell you that. The land 
that you were born on, which is something that most

18:29.865 --> 18:36.617
people who live on it don't know that much about it. 
That's what I was going to say. You do have a

18:37.799 --> 18:39.061
different soil. This is a lot of limestone out 
here. You just wait. I'll show you. The grass is

18:46.274 --> 18:47.355
thick. I'll show you some granite. There's 
another old jackfruit. Granite gravel that you

18:50.892 --> 18:54.717
just can't believe. The difference in the way it 
looks, the way it is, the whole thing.

19:02.969 --> 19:03.069
Okay. I know you have a crop of jackrabbits. I just 
keep seeing them all over the place out here. And

19:07.715 --> 19:14.485
that's one more good sign of a good depression. Of 
what? Oh, really? A good depression. A good

19:17.429 --> 19:18.891
depression. Okay. Jackrabbits?

19:24.099 --> 19:25.001
Bet. Look at your buzzards yonder. Yeah, I see 
them. On that cross line. Uh-huh. They roost on

19:31.409 --> 19:32.651
there. Oh, that's funny when they do that. Yes, and 
they'll be a dozen or more on each of them. There

19:40.341 --> 19:42.304
goes the Chaparral. Chaparral, Fasano, 
Roadrunner, Roadrunner, the whole bit. Oh, they

19:47.772 --> 19:50.015
are such fine-looking birds, really. They're 
aristocratic birds. They are, yes. They're

19:54.702 --> 19:57.906
smart-sided all the time now.

20:06.762 --> 20:10.407
Oh, there are really recent over there. There's 
four on that one. And then five, six. Two on down

20:13.211 --> 20:14.132
yonder. Yeah. And one over there. Now, they've got 
this telephone line pretty well up. Mm-hmm.

20:21.483 --> 20:22.084
Pretty well. Well, by the time we come back, 
there'll be a dozen on it. Probably.

20:28.653 --> 20:28.753
Yeah. How long has this particular ranch been in 
your family then? Well, we bought it back in 1940,

20:32.948 --> 20:40.026
and we've had it all these years. But we didn't pay 
much for it when we bought it. But it took me a long

20:46.739 --> 20:56.858
time because I was teaching about $45 a month and 
finally got up to $70 a month. And in 1952, I got $100

20:56.878 --> 21:00.204
a month. Oh my gosh, you were rolling the money. Oh 
yes, I sure was. But I made use of everything I had.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.779
Well, you've been dragging cedar down? Oh, yes. 
This is to clean that around here and up and down

21:15.300 --> 21:26.415
this road pathway so you can get in and out and know 
what is going on. You know, Willie Nelson had his

21:28.049 --> 21:31.353
first party. Yes. It was right across the river 
over here. And then he had his second one while it

21:34.596 --> 21:38.100
was over there. Now then he has it down at Pill Face, 
which is down the river about five miles. Right.

21:43.707 --> 21:48.232
And you can see over here that they're opening this 
up. So that's his place over there. Yeah, across

21:49.653 --> 21:50.534
the river. Yeah, I thought that was his ranch. And I 
tell you, they're opening that up as a development

21:52.552 --> 21:56.439
over there. Oh, pieces of Willie Nelson's ranch? 
Yeah. Okay. Go out there among the beer tab cans.

22:04.635 --> 22:04.735
Yeah. I don't know you right now. I told Gorky, I 
said, I'm ready to give this one up now. I said,

22:08.903 --> 22:10.566
we've had it. Uh-huh. Oh, this is just a beautiful 
piece of land. You've got elms, and you've got oak,

22:17.194 --> 22:23.858
and you've got... Well, I think all told, we've got 
about... 12 different species of timber. Yeah.

22:28.353 --> 22:35.201
And one of the things, I'm going to have to go down to 
the library and see if I can find out what it is. I'll

22:35.221 --> 22:37.824
tell you what, I can solve your problem. Brother 
Lynch at St. Edwards University, and I haven't,

22:37.984 --> 22:47.095
because of finances, picked you up a copy, has done 
the book on the hill country flora and fauna. And

22:47.311 --> 22:51.278
all your woods and everything from the madrone 
trees on down. Well, you know you can't get one of

22:51.419 --> 22:57.230
those madrone trees to grow. I can get you a madrone 
if you want one, but they are the dickens to grow.

23:03.481 --> 23:04.864
You just can't get them to do it. Uh-huh. I don't 
know. I've never had one that you could

23:08.190 --> 23:11.155
transplant. I've never found any roots that you 
could dig up. In fact, Mrs., I just don't believe

23:15.822 --> 23:18.887
that they can be... They are very rare trees. Oh, 
well, that has to be right. You do have some out

23:23.114 --> 23:24.336
here? Yeah. I don't know what to do with them. Lots 
of them over on the Miller Creek. Yeah, I've seen

23:30.145 --> 23:30.846
them. Look at there. Oh, darling, look at that. 
You're a mama. That's a mama. Yeah, look at that.

23:37.194 --> 23:37.955
Look at that thing. Bet you a dollar she's got some 
babies. I love it. Look at that. She'll raise it a

23:43.262 --> 23:44.824
third time. Uh-huh. If she's got babies. Almost a 
94 angle. She's behind that Algeria bush.

23:57.038 --> 23:58.167
There she is. She's got babies. Whoa, she is 
pretty. You can bet that when she raised that tail,

24:01.628 --> 24:07.476
and that was to tell them to sit still. She didn't 
run. She stayed. I know. She's got to have them

24:10.581 --> 24:12.363
somewhere around here. You bet. Nobody knows that 
unless they've watched them. Uh-huh. You know

24:16.349 --> 24:20.074
that other little bird, is it a bunting? Yeah. The 
little multicolored bird? Those things are sure

24:23.519 --> 24:25.743
pretty out here. I've seen several of those since 
when we lived in the hill country. Beautiful

24:30.289 --> 24:30.910
things.

24:34.737 --> 24:37.760
We have some kind of analogy in this tank down here. 
There's light red and I don't know what it is.

24:40.904 --> 24:41.464
Really? Yeah. I have to send it in for

24:42.105 --> 24:52.236
a sample. Well, I see my cows over on this side. What 
are they doing down here? When they're always over

24:58.733 --> 25:02.423
on the other side. Ava, this land is so fine. 
Really, this is beautiful, Ann. This is a pretty

25:09.644 --> 25:11.007
place. I don't care what it is. I hate to... Anybody 
around here have had an archaeological dig done on

25:13.786 --> 25:19.515
that property? I was just wondering, because I 
came out and worked an archaeology dig one time out

25:19.535 --> 25:27.046
in land that had a terrain similar to this. It was on 
the other side of the Perton Alley. That's what

25:28.789 --> 25:32.715
strikes my recollection. Oh, golly, that calf is 
in the field. He sure is in the field. As a matter of

25:36.861 --> 25:39.405
fact, there's several of them in the field. Is that 
your field? Yeah. That's your plow field. Let me

25:42.875 --> 25:44.921
catch this. He doesn't have it planted or 
anything. No.

26:35.967 --> 26:41.136
over yonder and see that house over there. Yeah. 
They have a smoke coming out. They're having a

26:45.925 --> 26:48.349
barbecue across the river. Oh at Willie's? Yep. 
Well, probably Jerry Jeff and everybody else

26:50.851 --> 26:55.618
showed up, and they didn't invite us. Aren't we 
lucky? Aren't we lucky? Don't go playing. No. Ava,

27:04.691 --> 27:06.954
that's not barbecue smoke. Oh, well, you did. All 
right. I thought I'd let you know. You're just

27:12.822 --> 27:14.925
going to kill me, huh? Right. It's just a giant 
reefer, right? A giant number. Okay. All right.

27:22.196 --> 27:24.901
We've got all of our babies. There's my little 
bull. Where? Right there. Oh, wonderful. Oh, he's

27:31.030 --> 27:33.754
looking up? That's his mama. Oh, that's his mama? 
Wait a minute. I don't see little Billy. That's one

27:39.181 --> 27:42.366
of my pets down there. I'm just going to see what I 
got here. They are excited.

27:58.283 --> 28:01.667
Well, I can't imagine him being over here. There's 
a little one yonder. Oh, what a tiny cat. Yeah, he's

28:07.215 --> 28:10.239
a little bitty tootin' by itself again. By itself, 
yes. I don't know where they is. Momma's. There's

28:14.605 --> 28:15.886
two little ones. Yeah, they're running together.

28:21.925 --> 28:24.830
I'm going to drive down here to this place. Okay. 
Ava, I never saw the hills in this particular park.

28:29.939 --> 28:31.081
This is a beautiful area. This is a pretty place, 
yes ma'am. This is the corner, far corner of Blanco

28:33.125 --> 28:36.551
County, isn't it? Well, this right now, we're in 
Hayes County. Hayes County. That's okay. We're in

28:40.719 --> 28:41.420
Hayes. We're in Hayes. Because I want to get the 
county maps. Further on down, we'll be in Travis.

28:48.411 --> 28:49.052
That's right. You go on into Travis. We're in 
Travis, Hayes, and Blanco. Yes, all three

28:54.720 --> 28:58.986
counties.

28:59.007 --> 29:01.530
Now, this is our water tank right up here. Uh-huh. 
But I won't drive in here and see. Well, I just won't

29:07.553 --> 29:08.895
drive in. Well, that's the best reason to do it. 
Then we'd come back through the pasture. Cows,

29:17.528 --> 29:22.737
bulls of horn, super bulls, all kinds of things. 
Now, when I was a kid, we used to go to my uncle's

29:22.757 --> 29:28.165
dairy farm, which was always a treat for me. I used 
to run up and down in milk stalls. Oh, I just thought

29:32.497 --> 29:34.601
that was the biggest tree. It's the only person 
that had a place with cattle that I grew up with.

29:40.854 --> 29:46.725
It's real nice, folks.

29:46.745 --> 29:48.649
But not like yours.

30:00.442 --> 30:05.131
Oh, well, it's just what you like to come down to 
see. When I come out here, I feel like I died and went

30:05.152 --> 30:09.761
to heaven. It's so quiet. Well, it is quiet. It's 
peaceful. It's the earth. Down to earth. Yeah.

30:18.318 --> 30:19.360
It's the good old earth. It is.

30:26.362 --> 30:33.992
i think it's a pretty part of the world no doubt no 
doubt

30:41.735 --> 30:43.237
Oh, so that's the place. The house coming. That's 
one of them. One of them. This is what we call the

30:46.621 --> 30:49.063
Schmidt Place. The Schmidt Place. 
S-C-H-M-I-D-T. Okay. Yeah. Das ist richtig. Das

30:55.851 --> 30:56.432
ist richtig. Schmidt. Now look at this grass. See 
what I'm telling you? Uh-huh. All right. You can

31:06.383 --> 31:08.586
tell... It's thick. That we've got plenty of it. 
Yeah, you have a lot of grass. And you just wait

31:13.413 --> 31:15.777
until we get over there with our calves. Okay. And 
I'll drive around and I'll show you the granny

31:16.338 --> 31:21.485
gravel. Now, well, you can see it through here. 
Yeah, it's red. This is a red. Yeah, all together

31:25.712 --> 31:27.534
different. It is. This is strong grass. And 
they'll range in through here all winter. And

31:34.745 --> 31:36.267
they'll have grass. And... Well, you can tell if 
this is green. And I see your cedars over there that

31:40.887 --> 31:43.913
are trees. They are not scrub cedar. No, they're 
not. They're tall and straight, almost like the

31:46.499 --> 31:51.289
ones I saw outside of Tennessee. Yeah. See these 
trees, how big they are? Yeah. The difference in

31:54.255 --> 31:55.077
them. The size of these? Sure. And this has never 
been cut off or anything. This is just the way that

32:00.588 --> 32:03.455
it was. Now, this was her catch pin. She wouldn't 
hold anything. That bull just went right over the

32:07.064 --> 32:11.135
top of it like he did. Yeah. That's not very good. 
No, it wasn't. We thought it was. Is that the river

32:15.842 --> 32:17.023
down there? I see the cotton or sycamores coming 
up. Sycamores, that's the spring. And then

32:22.690 --> 32:26.034
further on down is our river. The Schmidt Place is 
cute. I like the Schmidt Place. It's got a spring

32:28.897 --> 32:33.483
right down there that's never been dried. You see 
that cut bluff on yonder? Uh-huh. That's across

32:37.287 --> 32:38.529
the river. Yeah. Now, this is a granite No, right 
over there. We're going to drive over there. Okay.

32:46.887 --> 32:47.467
Yeah. All right. Drive around. It's all granite 
gravel territory, and we keep this feeder out

32:49.290 --> 33:09.917
here, keep it full all the time so that the

32:49.290 --> 33:09.917
cows will

32:49.290 --> 33:09.917
have plenty to eat.

33:14.825 --> 33:19.272
This is a thick, it's close to the ground grass. 
What is it? This is a curly mesquite. A what? Curly

33:25.182 --> 33:27.606
mesquite grass. You can look out there. You can 
look out over your window. Look at that. Yeah. See,

33:32.133 --> 33:34.356
it looks like it's curled up. Yeah, it does. That's 
what it's called. Curly mesquite.

33:41.909 --> 34:03.124
hugging the ground now this used to be feed crawls 
those stumps sticking out there where they'd have

33:41.909 --> 34:03.124
feet and that was a cedar picket fence see it just 
barely sticking out yeah it used to be an old field

33:41.909 --> 34:03.124
through here and that's a cedar picket fence that 
held it up here's another one here well we threw

33:41.909 --> 34:03.124
that diversion ditch up there to catch this water 
and keep it from washing. Yeah, well I see the

34:09.218 --> 34:12.045
spider webs by the way on the grass. We're not going 
to have any rain for a while either, I guarantee you

34:14.049 --> 34:19.662
that.

34:28.754 --> 34:33.306
Well there's, now this land is different from the 
land up near Johnson City. Yes ma'am, it sure is.

34:37.477 --> 34:40.605
Quite a bit different. Oh you got a barrel cactus 
out there, the prettiest little thing. We've got

34:43.942 --> 34:45.063
that big. Really? We've got a lot of them. Do you? 
I'm not familiar with the prickly pear out here,

34:49.147 --> 34:53.151
but I haven't seen that many of them. Yeah, we've 
got lots of them. Now, this was just a perfect bed of

34:55.693 --> 35:00.398
bluebonnets at one time. But we haven't had any 
great big lot of them. Well, we had a good many of two

35:04.702 --> 35:06.604
this year. But when we had sheep and goats, we just 
ate them up. Now, this is the... Look at the

35:13.810 --> 35:17.895
turkeys. Wild turkeys, Ava. Yes, those are wild. A 
whole flock. There's what? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

35:20.919 --> 35:29.410
10, 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, here's five more over here. 
Ava, that is a find. They're not wild. They're not

35:33.335 --> 35:34.636
wild. See, they're not running. They're not 
running. No, they're not. They are beautiful.

35:40.502 --> 35:41.623
That's a big bunch of them. That sure is. I've never 
seen that many together. Oh, I love my turkey

35:45.067 --> 35:46.468
thumbs. Watch them. Oh, they're running on down. 
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, they took on down the

35:51.813 --> 35:53.515
hill. But this is your granite gravel, and this is 
where... You remember him talking about...

36:03.018 --> 36:03.840
That holler? Yes, the holler. I have it written 
down. Blocker holler? Blocker holler. Right here

36:09.432 --> 36:10.174
we are. Okay, that's blocker holler. I now know 
where blocker holler is. Isn't that something?

36:17.372 --> 36:18.894
And he ran. Yeah. There's his Spanish hopes. 
There's his thicket down there. I can see it. I can

36:26.386 --> 36:27.327
see it. I tell you right now, hearing him talk about 
that, knowing how it all happened, you know, it's

36:27.347 --> 36:35.219
worth a lot to know where you are. But I've enjoyed 
it. I enjoy it, Roy. I enjoy it all. It's good for

36:39.365 --> 36:43.231
talking to him. Sure. But this is a... Boy, they're 
all going back over on the other side. I can't

36:49.453 --> 36:52.002
understand a word.

36:56.438 --> 36:57.763
I knew you brought me. I said, thank you. You 
brought me in there playing shy for you today. Oh,

37:03.382 --> 37:04.344
shoot. I can roll this down. They'll come right out 
here before you can turn around. But I just came

37:08.792 --> 37:10.896
down. Now there's a spring right down there, and it 
runs the year round. I see. How many springs do you

37:15.345 --> 37:17.089
have on the place? We have three. And they don't 
have to go very far for water anywhere. Like I say,

37:22.793 --> 37:25.637
this is one beautiful piece of land. It is a good 
piece of land. It is pretty. There's your barrel

37:28.560 --> 37:30.603
cactus again. Aren't they pretty? There's a bunch 
over there. They really are pretty. I'm just

37:35.488 --> 37:37.190
surprised to see them. Pretty red ones. Red 
blooms. There's a bunch over there. I'm just

37:40.935 --> 37:46.161
amazed because I'm just not used to seeing them. We 
have them here. You do have them here. It's sort of

37:50.305 --> 37:58.460
an isolated little place for them like that.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.223
We've got lots of grasshoppers, too. Yeah, I 
noticed you had your share of grasshoppers right

38:00.243 --> 38:03.028
now. That's what the turkeys like. Uh-huh.

38:07.956 --> 38:09.719
Now, you see how green this grass is? Yeah, I do, 
yeah. And you've got plenty of it. Yeah, they could

38:15.200 --> 38:18.725
feed a long time out here. We've got plenty to feed 
on. Well, we have 40 head of cattle and we've got 400

38:22.011 --> 38:28.561
acres, so they each can have it. Right. We've got 
enough. I think so. Well, that catch tank doesn't

38:32.907 --> 38:35.411
have any water in it. That's all right, too.

38:45.963 --> 38:48.309
This is a beautiful piece of land. This is pretty. 
You bet. Oh, gosh. Well, this guy out in Houston

38:52.240 --> 38:56.953
offered us $850 an acre for it. Really? I hope 
you're going to hold on to it. Well, I certainly am.

39:03.115 --> 39:04.518
Ten times more than that. Well, it's worth it to me 
just to get right over and look at it. Sure. Well,

39:09.006 --> 39:12.071
it's the kids, too. There's not a penny on it. Why 
sell it? Of course not. The government would get

39:15.998 --> 39:17.862
half of it. Oh, heavens, yes. And I don't see any 
sense in it. No, no, no, no. But as I say, this is the

39:21.940 --> 39:24.685
kids' land, too. You bet it is. And they love it. 
They enjoy it. And it would be a shame that anything

39:27.971 --> 39:36.726
should ever have to... That's the thing I always 
wanted was to own land in the hill country. Enough

39:36.746 --> 39:39.992
simply to drive on it when I felt like it. But to come 
out and know that you can share part of the quality

39:40.774 --> 39:46.564
of it. Too many things happen to a person. Already 
we've seen rabbits, and road runners, and wild

39:49.807 --> 40:00.526
turkeys, and we haven't been here, what, 15 
minutes? That's right. But you and Jillian. Yeah.

40:03.391 --> 40:03.772
You really do. Barrel of cactus. Barrel of cactus. 
Know that the springs are there, and the sycamore

40:06.457 --> 40:10.003
trees, and... Oh, that was growing up fine from it. 
It's a beautiful land. I think it is. I'll get me

40:16.792 --> 40:19.635
some one of these days. You've got these little, 
what do you call them? Daggers. Little daggers,

40:25.002 --> 40:26.123
yeah. Spanish daggers. Right.

40:31.089 --> 40:32.811
Remnants of earlier days. That's right.

40:44.645 --> 40:49.229
Beautiful.

40:49.249 --> 40:51.392
Is that a peach tree? That's a peach tree. It keeps 
the deer from getting it, but they get it. That's

40:57.037 --> 40:57.658
great. Now I bet that grew from somebody's picnic. 
That's the only way a peach tree are dismissed.

41:12.522 --> 41:14.044
Those white daisies are nice. I think they're

41:14.304 --> 41:24.356
pretty.

41:24.376 --> 41:27.940
Now we saw one part of this country. We're going to 
go this way down the river. I see the kids are in the

41:31.184 --> 41:34.407
road. Oh yes.

41:41.075 --> 41:42.538
Now what is this, what are they? They're Brehmer 
and... This is Brehmer and Angus cows. Brehmer and

41:45.123 --> 41:46.827
Angus, okay. And I see is that your white... No, 
there's no bulls here. Yeah? These are all babies.

41:54.803 --> 41:55.785
Yeah, I see it. No bulls, right? No bulls. That's 
your cow right there, the one that was in the

41:59.011 --> 42:01.817
picture. No. No? Neither of those. They're 
pretty. Gosh, they're beautiful animals. They

42:07.183 --> 42:08.126
are pretty. There's the two baby calves. Yeah. 
Nice.

42:17.322 --> 42:22.090
When they brought the Brema into this part of the 
country, what was that like? Oh, boy, it was a

42:22.110 --> 42:23.813
regular rebellion. People just thought we were 
crazy as the devil when we first came in here. I

42:29.202 --> 42:43.465
guess it led us back about the first Bremas we had 
here, of course, was back in 1939,

42:29.202 --> 42:43.465
1940.

42:44.862 --> 42:50.668
And we started the herd down in the city. Yeah,

42:51.369 --> 43:01.000
they are down there.

43:01.020 --> 43:01.120
Yeah. Well, I know they did that. And what's the 
other, there's another African breed that they

43:02.061 --> 43:06.846
brought in. I'm trying to think of what that one 
was. Well, now, they have them. There are two

43:10.968 --> 43:13.111
different species of breamers. One is the 
Guzzerat and the other is the Zebu. The Zebu has a

43:20.801 --> 43:30.073
long keen body and the Guzzerat is more or less 
stocky-billed.

43:30.847 --> 43:33.349
Well, my little bull's not bearing up. I see some 
over here coming. Yonder's my big bull. Yeah, I

43:36.232 --> 43:37.413
see. I can't think that two of the prettiest bulls 
you've ever looked at. I don't care what anybody

43:40.495 --> 43:41.917
says. They're big from here, so they've got to be 
big when we get to them. Now, you see, right here is

43:46.841 --> 43:49.243
Brush Harbor. And this was on the roads, the old 
Austin Road. This is right here. And let me see if

43:55.809 --> 44:00.853
you can see the well right over there. Uh-huh. Hand 
dug well. You see it right there? Yes, I sure do. The

44:05.518 --> 44:06.539
old rock around it. Yeah, you see that supposed to 
be the bucket thing that hung up on it? That's,

44:12.525 --> 44:16.269
well, it looks like a cross. Well, that was it. And 
they would get five cents a bucket for the water for

44:18.311 --> 44:22.415
their horses. Oh, my gosh. That's right, right 
there. Some unusual plants growing over there,

44:26.247 --> 44:29.875
Ava. Well, that's a spice tree or a pepper tree. Is 
it? It's a pepper tree. That's right. And it's...

44:39.697 --> 44:40.878
Now that's a tank. Yeah. And this is where the 
old... You heard him talk about Old Man Lawson?

44:48.206 --> 44:48.607
Yeah. All right. This is the old Lawson place right 
here. And this is one we've got the land grant on.

44:54.714 --> 44:55.495
Oh, yes. I've seen that land grant. I saw you open 
that up and show it to Carkey right when you had it.

45:00.820 --> 45:03.083
You see this grass, how pretty and green? Yeah, so 
delicate, so soft. All right. I used to make many a

45:09.228 --> 45:15.001
bed out of this fresh green grass, that color. Oh, 
yeah. Remember? Playing in it. But it's because I

45:17.807 --> 45:24.180
grew up around David Long, so that's it. Well. 
They're working on the barn? Yeah, they're going

45:26.875 --> 45:29.359
to finish building it one of these days. One of 
these days. Well, now here's a little log cabin and

45:31.181 --> 45:35.228
here's the chimney and a trailer. And a trailer, 
that's right. Yeah, we're going to have to come out

45:37.591 --> 45:42.118
here and stay and watch the sunset. Okay. That's 
what I wanted to do the other time. And you see that

45:46.264 --> 45:51.593
old

45:46.264 --> 45:51.593
fireplace? Yeah. It's put together with red. 
Clay. Yeah, I see it. And plain old grass and chips.

46:04.705 --> 46:07.650
That's not put together with concrete. Yeah, 
clay. Yeah. And grass. Sure. Yeah. Now, does that

46:13.218 --> 46:14.863
chimney draw us better? Oh, boy, it sure does. I bet 
it does. And that was the smokehouse. OK. And it's

46:21.063 --> 46:22.267
still there. And of course, we tore that old house 
down. Sure. Wow, this is really nice. Here they

46:30.930 --> 46:31.792
come. Oh, look at them. I believe we won't move down 
forever since he's coming up here. Okay. I'll just

46:39.125 --> 46:40.828
move back up here. Hey, that's the biggest bull 
I've ever seen. Both

46:45.717 --> 46:49.504
of them. Oh, my goodness.

47:04.366 --> 47:21.421
Yeah,

47:04.366 --> 47:21.421
this is beautiful land. I'll have to listen to when 
you

47:21.441 --> 47:33.592
call them, okay? That was sick. Yeah. Come on, 
cowboy! Well, come on. Are my babies hungry? Bless

47:42.582 --> 47:44.525
their hearts. Come on, little man. I didn't love 
you yesterday. Well...

47:48.893 --> 47:55.905
Well, hello, Slim Jim. Oh, yes, they're all just so 
glad to see mommy.

48:12.290 --> 48:17.156
Well, come on. Come on. What about that one? Come 
on, little

48:20.185 --> 48:45.045
boy. Come on. Well, mommy knows you're hungry.

48:55.330 --> 48:57.893
Come on, little bull. Come on,

48:57.913 --> 49:04.281
little bull.

49:10.007 --> 49:10.628
Come on. Well, now, listen.

49:16.419 --> 49:23.619
I just don't like for you to run him off just because 
you don't want him here. Now, how's that? That's

49:24.722 --> 49:26.025
big. Whoa, I've never seen one like that. This

49:29.002 --> 49:39.195
is the one that weighs 70. Is this the new one? No, 
okay. This is the one we raised. This is the one we

49:42.979 --> 49:49.648
raised.

49:49.668 --> 49:50.188
This is the one we raised. And that

49:50.208 --> 49:54.013
was a little girl. Aren't

49:55.377 --> 50:10.617
they

49:55.377 --> 50:10.617
sweet, though? I like that expression, Ava. What 
do you call that? Little bull, what are you doing?

50:17.686 --> 50:18.887
You didn't come over here. Mommy didn't get... Oh, 
you've got old ants on you. Let them stand.

50:23.913 --> 50:28.338
Ladybug!

50:29.240 --> 50:30.541
Oh, come on. That's a little bull. That little 
bull. Mommy's going to take him to town. You bet she

50:34.286 --> 50:35.227
is. You're going to graze in the yard, right? Just 
going to stage him in the yard. That's a good one.

50:41.775 --> 50:42.656
Ain't that sweet? Oh, he's a nice one. Yeah. Look at 
that. He'll turn around and see me, but listen,

50:48.533 --> 50:54.080
he'll come back. Mm-hmm. But isn't he pretty? And 
you see why I don't want to get rid of him? Yeah.

51:05.393 --> 51:05.793
Listen to him. And that one over there, just hear 
him roar, and he wants somebody to love him, and I

51:06.715 --> 51:14.604
just can't make up my mind. He's a big old thing.

51:19.297 --> 51:45.523
Just

51:19.297 --> 51:45.523
getting

51:19.297 --> 51:45.523
to you,

51:19.297 --> 51:45.523
huh?

51:46.668 --> 51:47.829
Isn't that a pretty thing? Yeah. This little tap 
right here? Yeah. Yeah, that's a beautiful color.

51:53.416 --> 51:55.558
I'll tell you what. What? I've got another little 
bull. Come here. Come on. Come on over here, little

51:59.663 --> 52:00.644
bull. He's up for you. Come on. Hurry up. Uh-uh. 
Little bull, don't do that. I don't want you in my

52:06.892 --> 52:07.893
car. Come on, fella. You haven't helped me look. 
Come on. Come on. Hurry up. I don't have time. You

52:17.262 --> 52:19.966
see this? Yeah, another one. Just all you have to do 
is come on. I don't have time. Come on over here.

52:25.755 --> 52:27.017
Let's get out of those ants. Come on. Well, come on. 
Well, all right. He's a little scared. No? No. He's

52:33.127 --> 52:36.312
got other things on his mind. Oh, he does. He's 
growing these days. This one wants to be friendly

52:38.356 --> 52:41.601
right here. Now, you won't believe it. Do you see 
this cow right here? Yeah. Oh, she's 20 years old.

52:49.152 --> 52:50.213
Oh, my heavens. That's right. She looks good. Sure 
she looks good. All right, here's her calf right

52:54.880 --> 52:56.843
here. This one? Okay. That's a good calf. That's a 
good calf, right? Now, to me, I hate to say it, but

53:02.470 --> 53:09.600
she's in good shape and has a good calf. Yeah. But 
she's 20. 20 years is old enough for anybody, so you

53:12.064 --> 53:17.392
just will get rid of it. And that old, that one right 
over yonder? Mm-hmm. She's 18. Come on, Ladybug.

53:26.985 --> 53:28.047
Come on, Ladybug. I haven't loved you yet. You see 
this black face one? Yeah, she's the one with the

53:34.852 --> 53:38.797
black eyes. Listen, this one over here is back from 
mowing. That's a good boy. Yeah, that is a good

53:45.125 --> 53:46.507
calf. A 20-year-old mom. I got fingernails, 
fella. You're going to get

53:53.196 --> 54:00.285
your neck scratched. Yeah. Oh, I love his ears. But 
you know, that one's got... What? It's hard to say.

54:11.681 --> 54:14.966
It's got something under its... Uh-huh. But I 
guess that's that feed. Yeah. Oh, shoot. Is this

54:20.754 --> 54:24.860
just... Well, I've got all kinds of nuisance. You 
sure do. Well, let's go up to the house. Okay. I

54:28.486 --> 54:29.447
don't want to be a traitor. I

54:29.765 --> 54:33.993
tell you, he's a toughy. How old is this white brain 
man right there? He's six. He's six.

54:42.290 --> 54:45.937
Well, Cynthia, I don't care. You, you. If you have 
to come out here and you can see it. But you know,

54:50.732 --> 54:53.717
people won't believe it. I believe you, Ava. I 
believe it. All these bramas are your friends. You

55:00.347 --> 55:01.709
have me convinced. They don't, too. They're my 
friends, too. Me pet them. Yeah. They really like

55:06.676 --> 55:08.439
that petting now. They really do. And everybody 
says that you can't get near a brama like that.

55:12.705 --> 55:13.186
Yeah. But that's not so. That sure isn't safe. No. 
Uh, tall boy, you're not coming in the house,

55:17.072 --> 55:24.342
that's all. Okay. Well.

55:28.488 --> 55:34.637
The food's a little bit warm in here, but who 
doesn't have an air conditioner? Oh, this is

55:34.657 --> 55:38.863
comfortable. Would be. Sure. Sure. I see that 
quirky has made up in the bed. We don't put sheets or

55:44.131 --> 55:45.874
anything on. Well, no, not until we get ready to use 
them. Right. Here's the washer. Oh, it's just as

55:52.544 --> 55:54.967
nice a place as any. And this is his bed back here. 
See the clothes? Yeah. That's his room thing.

56:04.021 --> 56:05.883
Well, we got three bed, three. We got three 
bedrooms. Well, anyway, this is the perfect place

56:09.530 --> 56:12.534
to spend some time. I told you. I tell you, I should 
have rented this place to write the book. I believe

56:18.903 --> 56:19.444
so. I may have to do that. We'll call it Paisano, 
isn't that what Dobie's Ranch is called? Yeah, the

56:25.232 --> 56:27.255
Paisano? Yeah, that's what we'll do. Sure. I like 
your ashtray. I made that. I was just going to ask

56:34.205 --> 56:35.387
you. Now, that's a good one. Freshwater clam 
shells, right?

56:49.358 --> 56:56.412
Well, they are really friendly, friendly 
grandma's and friendly animals, friendly

56:49.358 --> 56:56.412
animals.

57:09.048 --> 57:15.158
I remember you wrote me in your letter about coming 
out here and finding the calf with the infected

57:09.048 --> 57:15.158
navel. And then how you used the old remedy rather 
than

57:16.580 --> 57:26.075
an injection on it. Just muddied him up.

57:31.022 --> 57:34.768
Well, I've done a lot of things in my day.

57:47.894 --> 57:59.008
I

57:47.894 --> 57:59.008
don't know. I don't regret any of it, though. It's 
all been worth it so far as I'm concerned. I've had a

58:06.338 --> 58:08.520
happy life and a hard life. Well, your life has been 
constant in one way, whereas I think nowadays

58:08.681 --> 58:14.408
people don't find that to be an occurrence. Life 
just simply isn't constant. It's fragmented.

58:20.338 --> 58:21.659
You've always had the ranch. You've always had 
cattle. That's right. You've always had that to

58:24.341 --> 58:26.223
fall back on. You knew yourself. Listen, the thing 
of it is

58:28.505 --> 58:43.720
there has never been a time in my life that I haven't 
had an extra job to do. Whether it was teaching

58:52.024 --> 59:08.285
school at that particular time and working at the 
garage or whether it was working here at the place,

58:52.024 --> 59:08.285
I've always had plenty to do all my life.

59:11.830 --> 59:14.854
Old Cork's got this pretty well cleaned up and 
fixed up. Yeah, he's a pretty good housekeeper.

59:17.936 --> 59:19.699
I'll get all this straight right here. Now

59:19.739 --> 59:30.655
this is really comfortable. I don't know where 
these go.

59:37.605 --> 59:42.833
Oh, isn't that sad to hear that kind of call? That's 
the call of the wild.

59:50.794 --> 59:50.954
Uh-huh. So did you tell me how old the White Bramer 
is? You said he was about six? Yes, the White Bramer

59:54.898 --> 59:56.880
is six years old. He's six years old. Yeah. And he 
weighs about how much? That White Bramer weighed

01:00:01.445 --> 01:00:05.008
1740. And that old tall boy, you said that's the 
biggest thing? That's the biggest thing I've ever

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.456
seen. I believe. I don't know. I don't know 
exactly. I don't have any idea. But I would say that

01:00:19.734 --> 01:00:31.268
he will come nearer when 1800

01:00:19.734 --> 01:00:31.268
than you will anything. Yep, he's big. Well, you 
ready to go? All right. Would you like a cold beer

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:39.815
before we leave? Well, if you'd like to, we'll 
break one out. We can go back with one out of hand. We

01:00:43.423 --> 01:00:44.365
got here with one. We can't let Willie Nelson party 
alone, can we? Oh, my gosh.
