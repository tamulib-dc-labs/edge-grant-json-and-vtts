WEBVTT

00:01.853 --> 00:17.409
out rather quickly when he got to working with this 
that he could do many things with the machine, one

00:01.853 --> 00:17.409
of which was that he could take some of this musty, 
moldy, off-color grain and clean it up pretty

00:01.853 --> 00:17.409
well. Sure enough. Right. And so he's feeling like 
he's really sitting in the driver's seat on this

00:19.572 --> 00:25.598
South Texas grain right now. Is that right? Well, 
that's great. John, that must be the ideal double

00:29.478 --> 00:41.895
application of some research findings that are 
applicable over and above something else you set

00:29.478 --> 00:41.895
out to do. Now, he didn't really start out trying to 
treat that kind of grain. He tried to increase the

00:45.600 --> 00:50.126
digestibility of good whole number one or two or 
three. Right, number two regular grain. And he

00:51.568 --> 00:53.270
didn't set out to do that either. It was our results 
right there in that publication that showed there

00:58.283 --> 01:07.473
was no difference between 100% popped and the 
partial and non-popped fractions that convinced

00:58.283 --> 01:07.473
him there's no point in trying to pop it. And what 
percentage energy saving did he, right there, how

01:08.174 --> 01:13.439
much did he affect? We don't have any information. 
Well, I would guess that, I would guess easily 25%,

01:14.921 --> 01:23.430
but that's just my wild guess is all. But at any 
rate, now King Ranch has a micronizing system in.

01:29.905 --> 01:30.286
They do? Yeah, they put one in. Is this being 
commercially manufactured in? Yes. Who is making

01:36.053 --> 01:38.316
it? Some outfit in Nebraska, so I really don't know 
the name of it. It's comparatively recent. You

01:45.345 --> 01:54.396
see, Chardo got Jay Taylor interested in the 
thing, and Jay looked at it for a while, I said,

01:56.131 --> 01:58.974
Chardo, I'm going to join you. And that gave Chardo 
access to the engineering facilities of,

01:58.994 --> 02:10.687
what's this, Halliburton. Really? Yeah, in 
Oklahoma City. And of course, up to then, Chardo

02:14.752 --> 02:19.998
was just kind of a blacksmith mechanic. He was 
pretty good, and he knew what he wanted to do, and he

02:20.018 --> 02:24.383
could do it if he had the time. He didn't have access 
to the engineering talent that a company like that

02:25.257 --> 02:31.424
had. I don't know how much that may have helped him, 
but I'm sure it helped some. And of course, it gave

02:35.269 --> 02:42.977
him around the world contact through Jay Taylor.

02:43.598 --> 02:48.584
He was here for this meeting this week, and he told 
me, I believe there are 43 of these things

02:43.598 --> 02:48.584
operating in Japan now. Sure enough. I don't 
suppose he's got that many in this country by quite

02:50.766 --> 02:53.830
a bit. The Japanese are very aggressive, though, 
in adopting and adapting something like that,

02:55.463 --> 03:01.031
though, aren't they? Yes. They've got one or two of 
them in England and some in Europe, I think. I don't

03:05.697 --> 03:06.558
know just where. But at any rate, that's kind of our 
story on it. And I hope we can get enough

03:11.004 --> 03:22.500
information on this kind of grain here in the next 
three months to have some sort of a decent package

03:11.004 --> 03:22.500
that Well, in your feeding trials, John, are you 
going to be utilizing this as well? No. Well? Well,

03:28.598 --> 03:29.699
we may. What we're really trying to do— It seems 
like it would be to their advantage to fund you

03:30.761 --> 03:41.115
people trying some of that and see if it does make an 
appreciable difference in the quality. We're

03:41.355 --> 03:43.919
trying to get King Ranch to do this since they have 
the grain. You're trying to get King Ranch, and

03:43.939 --> 03:46.002
they've got the machine. And they've got the 
equipment. Yeah. It seems like that. I'm not

03:49.396 --> 03:59.009
really interested in a comparative trial of 
micronized versus dry ground, because we've

03:49.396 --> 03:59.009
already got that. We've even got it in the 
commercial feedlot. No, but I was thinking about

04:03.415 --> 04:05.959
this quality. I'm interested in what it's done 
here, and this is what Stephen Klaver said, that we

04:05.999 --> 04:15.572
might have some of this stuff that we've harvested 
before and after And I suggested to him, in fact I

04:16.396 --> 04:29.010
was writing a letter about it, that okay, we'd like 
to see some of this grain fed just dry ground or dry

04:16.396 --> 04:29.010
road. Just shut your burners off and run it through 
the machine. And then turn them on and go the

04:32.834 --> 04:39.181
micronizing route and just simply compare this in 
that case. We won't have, at least we haven't got it

04:40.362 --> 04:45.087
yet, a number two control to compare it with, 
because they didn't separate their grain. He said

04:53.168 --> 05:00.717
what we did, he said we had this damaged grain and we 
checked it through the micronizer to find out it

04:53.168 --> 05:00.717
was processed, and we found out it did. So we just 
went ahead and dumped everything in the same bin.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.762
Sure enough. So they're number two and they're 
damaged, micronized grain, everything's all

05:04.782 --> 05:09.207
together. Well, they're liable to have spotty 
results, even so, aren't they? unless they feed it

05:15.003 --> 05:16.425
blended. Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of like a 
hose that's got some air in it, you know. Yeah, it

05:21.492 --> 05:27.360
comes out and spurts.

05:27.701 --> 05:28.722
That's sort of our story. I think we've pretty well 
got something to work on now. We will have this test

05:32.548 --> 05:37.475
going at Perry Foundation. And I've tried to get 
Perry, since they've got both kinds of grain, to

05:47.133 --> 05:49.235
put up four treatments. One would be the number two 
grain, and they can only dry grind, cleaned and

05:50.476 --> 05:59.485
uncleaned. That's number two grain. Just really 
clean it up, blow all the trash and dirt out of it,

06:01.968 --> 06:07.754
and then feed it in the unclean form. And then do the 
same thing with this stuff, cleaned and

06:07.894 --> 06:14.220
uncleaned.

06:15.044 --> 06:17.707
And then if you add the effects of King Ranch. If we 
get to it, if we get some information from King

06:18.448 --> 06:22.714
Ranch, that'd be that. Now at Beeville, what we 
plan to do is to run three treatments that will be

06:22.774 --> 06:34.769
replicated. One of them will be with number two 
grain, dry ground. And that will be 100% of the

06:39.455 --> 06:42.739
grain in that ration. Another ration in which 
we'll use 100% of this, just dry ground. And the

06:48.430 --> 06:54.538
third one in which we will blend 50-50 of this stuff 
in the number two. There's one thing that probably

06:56.440 --> 07:03.429
would be worth doing if we could get it done 
somewhere, and I don't know yet how to do it. And

07:05.172 --> 07:09.317
that would be to clean, take a big batch of this 
stuff and clean it. I don't have any idea how much

07:10.445 --> 07:33.162
you'd have to do it, but what I'd like to do there 
would be to be able to take this grain, cleaned,

07:10.445 --> 07:33.162
thoroughly cleaned, and then blend back the 
cleanings in given percentages, maybe two and a

07:10.445 --> 07:33.162
half and five and seven and a half percent.

07:34.222 --> 07:38.546
We should get that same type of information from 
our physical characterization. In other words,

07:38.786 --> 07:42.929
when you take this kind of grain, what percentage 
of this junk do you get out of it?

07:46.172 --> 07:57.922
But that won't tell us anything about feeding 
value other than we don't count dirt and a lot of

07:46.172 --> 07:57.922
this low quality stuff as having very much feeding 
value anyway. It tends to dilute the energy

07:58.002 --> 08:00.224
content. It's a negative quality. It has a 
negative quality, really. and if it's low enough

08:05.305 --> 08:19.568
it may actually take energy to to get it processed 
through the digestive tract rather than

08:05.305 --> 08:19.568
contributing anything at all from an energy 
standpoint. Kind of like feeding feeding

08:19.588 --> 08:27.100
polyethylene. You know it's completely inert. 
Yeah. But sometimes we use it for a roughing it's

08:33.149 --> 09:01.806
beautiful roughage and of course you've seen the 
uh the other Polyethylene comes in many forms,

09:03.237 --> 09:11.065
including sheaths that you put over your bowls in 
the refrigerator. There's one of them. That's

09:13.828 --> 09:15.850
those so-called rough tabs. Here's another one 
that's finer ground stuff. And we've used it in

09:22.897 --> 09:24.799
beadlets. It looks like you might have hammered up 
some of this white pipe that they use. Well,

09:31.105 --> 09:32.907
strange to say. The Phillips Company in Houston 
has got a mountain of that out there. Have they?

09:38.935 --> 09:39.035
Yeah. It's right on the banks of the ship channel 
and every so often they have to send a bulldozer out

09:39.055 --> 09:48.650
there to level the thing off or something to make 
room for some more. That's lighter than cork. No

09:52.756 --> 09:53.657
use for it, huh? Well, what they were interested in 
was the possibility that it might be used as a

09:54.338 --> 09:58.945
roughage. And this was at a time. It was lighter 
than cork. Why don't they use it for stuff in life

10:01.411 --> 10:04.335
preserves and the like? Well, I'm sure that 
they've looked at many things and many

10:04.475 --> 10:18.694
possibilities, one of which was possibly using it 
for roughage and feeds. Yeah. I've got a young

10:18.834 --> 10:28.527
friend who works for Union Carbide, and he took one 
look at that stuff and he said, well, That's a

10:29.485 --> 10:30.386
mistake. There's something wrong with the 
process of reasoning out that. Unfortunately,

10:34.371 --> 10:46.848
Union Carbide has to pay Phillips Company a 
royalty for the use of their process, which they

10:34.371 --> 10:46.848
don't even use. He said our process is much better 
than that. If we got that, we'd figure that we were

10:51.794 --> 10:56.961
completely off target with our process. So he just 
considers that, and that's just bad technology in

10:58.375 --> 11:05.162
the process somewhere.

11:09.246 --> 11:13.071
But this dang stuff, and I saw this, and I mean, God, 
this is soap powder. Yeah, it looks like it. But

11:14.652 --> 11:16.875
it's that same stuff. You can get it in all 
different densities.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.923
Well, I guess I better go on over and see. What I can 
do to help Steve, but I think that we've got a real

11:26.303 --> 11:34.151
good basis for doing a column on that. Well, that's 
about all I can tell you. I haven't got any results.

11:38.996 --> 11:39.197
No. And I think this is the thing I've been— Too soon 
for results, isn't it? This is the thing I've

11:43.661 --> 11:47.025
always been extremely critical of Texas Tech for. 
They're always talking about what they're going

11:47.045 --> 11:52.491
to do and don't deliver too well. Well, I think we 
can trade on our— reputation in this instance to do

11:55.818 --> 11:58.602
a story. We've delivered enough time that I'm sure 
that people give us the benefit of the doubt in this

11:59.904 --> 12:06.493
one instance. But I'm like you. I don't too much 
like one of these stories that we've got a problem

12:07.375 --> 12:12.542
and we're researching it. Yeah, we're going to win 
the football conference.

12:18.831 --> 12:20.974
Tell the last game in Slade you won't know that. 
That's for sure. Well, okay.
