WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:07.036
Other big events of the time, describe Silver 
Taps. Silver Taps was a very solemn occasion. They

00:14.064 --> 00:20.653
would play the Silver Taps from the perimeter of 
the dome of the academic building. And we would all

00:20.673 --> 00:26.460
go to the area on the west side of the academic 
building. and we would stand in detention and the

00:27.841 --> 00:56.346
band would be there and the band would play the 
Spirit of Aggieland and then the buglers, about

00:27.841 --> 00:56.346
six of them, you couldn't see them and they would 
play that tap and it would just make

00:27.841 --> 00:56.346
ripples run up and down your back because it was so

00:59.768 --> 01:02.551
So effective. Then they'd read the names of those 
people and they'd play the silver tabs. Then it

01:09.058 --> 01:12.641
would break up and it was just total silence. You 
could hear a pin drop right out there. Thousands of

01:15.644 --> 01:18.627
young men standing around. When it was all over, 
they'd just break and everybody there would go

01:18.728 --> 01:28.377
just in groups right till they're gone.

01:28.538 --> 01:28.898
Mustard. We didn't have much in the way of a muster 
for three years, but then our senior year, April

01:30.397 --> 01:51.142
21st, we had some kind of a tape message from 
General Moore from the building. From

01:51.162 --> 01:52.003
Corregidor. From Corregidor. Do you remember 
where the ceremony was held on campus? Yes, the

01:56.629 --> 01:59.492
ceremony was held on the north side of Goodman Hall 
on the steps. And I remember this thing from the

02:06.388 --> 02:12.116
Philippines was replayed right there. It was all 
on some kind of a machine. And we all heard it very

02:15.781 --> 02:18.425
well. And you know, that's about the time of the 
fall of Corregidor, wasn't it?

02:28.558 --> 02:29.800
April of 42. just a little before. Yeah. Let's see, 
how often did you go home? I went home, I came down

02:38.690 --> 02:45.821
here in early September and I went home 
Thanksgiving. I went home Christmas.

02:49.667 --> 02:55.416
And if I was lucky I got to go home sometime in the 
spring, but most likely I didn't. I stayed here for

02:57.775 --> 02:58.736
from the spring break. We had two breaks. We had a 
break at Christmas and then we had a break at

02:59.718 --> 03:04.105
Easter. When you, before you had a car, how'd you 
get back and forth on those brief trips to

03:06.208 --> 03:15.723
Greenville? Well, I'd go to the corner where the

03:24.691 --> 03:28.615
I guess there's an old Safeway store there now 
taken over by the county. It's mental health and

03:29.215 --> 03:37.143
mental retardation in Bryan on about 24th Street 
and Texas Avenue. If I was going to go to

03:37.163 --> 03:42.347
Greenville, I'd pack a small bag. I'd have my 
uniform on. If it was raining, I'd have my

03:45.350 --> 03:47.713
raincoat. And I'd catch a bus to Bryan. I'd get to 
that corner where all the Aggies were, and I'd say,

03:54.020 --> 03:58.687
what's the number? And most of the time, it was 170. 
169 of them being ahead of me. That whole

04:07.539 --> 04:12.046
churchyard, there's a little church there. And so 
what I would do, the first offer I got to get out of

04:12.066 --> 04:21.900
Brian, to Hearn, or any Madisonville, or anywhere 
else, all those I'd take. Because I was going to sit

04:21.920 --> 04:23.622
there a long time. So sometime going to 
Greenville, I caught 10 rides. Norm, what was the

04:29.604 --> 04:32.107
average length of time? To wait? No, no, from here 
to Greenville. Oh, sometime 11, 12 hours. But

04:40.616 --> 04:43.539
sometime I made it in six or seven, just lucky. 
Sometime I'd catch a ride and go all the way to

04:43.959 --> 04:46.702
Dallas. Did you normally go to Dallas and then? 
Yeah, then go to Greenville. I could go to Dallas

04:51.467 --> 04:53.389
and go down there around where the bus station was 
and get one of those cars that would take people for

04:53.774 --> 05:02.187
a small amount of money. They had those in the 
Depression. I could go down there and say, I want to

05:05.933 --> 05:09.659
go over to Greenville. And they'd check their 
little list and say, oh, here we got one that's

05:09.679 --> 05:14.607
going to be leaving here in a little while. And I 
said, how much? And they'd say a dollar. I said, I

05:17.031 --> 05:19.134
want to go. And that car would come by there. four or 
five others that was in the car. So you never put up a

05:24.856 --> 05:27.599
sign that said Greenville? No. But you always wore 
your uniform? Always wore my uniform. Did you put

05:31.222 --> 05:32.283
up a thumb? Yes. To show you were hijacked? Oh yes, 
I'd ask you to ride. Did you ever have anything

05:36.768 --> 05:43.755
approaching a negative experience with the 
person that gave you a ride? No. Did you know of

05:43.875 --> 05:45.336
anybody that ever did? No. I haven't heard of any 
yet. No, no. I never had a problem with anybody. I

05:49.861 --> 05:51.422
don't know anybody that ever did. Now, were other 
college students hitchhiking as much as Aggies?

05:55.315 --> 05:55.596
No. No, we had such an edge with the uniform. That's 
what I have to say. The uniform, people seemed not

06:00.721 --> 06:07.328
to worry about the Aggies because we had the 
uniforms on. And they weren't afraid of us.

06:13.614 --> 06:21.662
In terms of these worldwide events, do you 
remember any other other than Pearl Harbor and

06:13.614 --> 06:21.662
then what followed it? Do you remember any other 
events plus good or bad events that startled you

06:21.980 --> 06:31.772
and your friends while you were here? Were you all 
alert of when Hitler invaded Poland? Yes.

06:38.740 --> 06:48.071
Hitler's movement through Poland and all of that, 
we were on the radio all the time listening to that.

06:48.091 --> 06:49.793
It was just a common practice. And we were very 
conversant with Hitler's aggression.

06:57.619 --> 07:11.234
So we were

06:57.619 --> 07:11.234
right there on

06:57.619 --> 07:11.234
the ball on every move that he was making, knowing 
all along that we were going to end up in the war. We

07:11.895 --> 07:15.679
knew we were going to be in the war sooner or later. 
I'm trying to think of any big event that happened

07:16.469 --> 07:27.742
in those years, let's see, 38, 39, 40, 41. Well, I 
don't

07:27.762 --> 07:37.993
think that any worldwide event that I recall. I 
remember when the Hindenburg caught fire, but I

07:38.254 --> 07:45.582
think that was before I was in A&M. And

07:46.810 --> 08:00.786
I remember the airplane, the B-25, running into 
Waldorf Astoria, but I was up in New York sometime

07:46.810 --> 08:00.786
then, so events like that.

08:04.831 --> 08:08.495
Let's see, what's the final review of your senior 
year? Was that all very stirring? Very stirring,

08:11.799 --> 08:15.163
yes, very stirring.

08:16.679 --> 08:24.331
It was,

08:16.679 --> 08:24.331
it was real sentimental, emotional. We had, as you 
know, we had two reviews. The senior led the Corps

08:27.115 --> 08:34.347
around and then we stepped aside and the junior 
stepped forward. If they had boots they put them on

08:35.749 --> 08:43.581
and here they go around again and it was really a 
very sentimental experience. The court trips

08:44.405 --> 08:47.309
were important in those days. Yes, yes. And 
special trains. Yeah, talk about that. We'd go to

08:51.634 --> 09:05.652
either Fort Worth or Dallas one year and then we'd 
go to Houston or Waco and they'd bring trains in for

08:51.634 --> 09:05.652
Houston or Dallas, Fort Worth, Fort Worth. And it 
was about three or four bucks for a round trip from

09:05.672 --> 09:12.741
here to Dallas.

09:13.683 --> 09:25.536
If somebody couldn't afford a ticket, well, you 
know how those seats were pushed together like

09:13.683 --> 09:25.536
this and there was an opening under here? Sometime 
we had as many as three or four down between those

09:25.556 --> 09:32.243
seats, backs of the seats. And we always had a bunch 
of old coats laying over them. And somebody would

09:36.408 --> 09:42.795
create a little diversion when the ticket takers 
came along just to get them. moving on. Did y'all

09:44.561 --> 09:49.308
ever suspect that probably the ticket taker knew 
what was happening? Oh yes, yes. We thought we were

09:50.470 --> 09:51.812
real smart. Most of the cases they knew. They could 
read us better than we could read them. Alright, so

09:58.060 --> 09:59.142
you went up there. Did the train stay there? Did 
y'all get to sleep on the train? No, we never slept

10:02.767 --> 10:05.151
on the train. Where would you spend the night? 
Well, somebody would have a hotel room. And about

10:11.210 --> 10:13.894
30 of us would spend the night. We'd sleep on the 
floors. And in most cases, however, we all had

10:16.517 --> 10:25.108
friends from either Dallas or Fort Warner or 
Houston or Waco. And in most cases, we were invited

10:25.128 --> 10:29.194
to spend the night at these friends' houses. So you 
did two of those a year. Yeah. Which was your

10:33.199 --> 10:36.103
favorite town? Well, since I was from Greenville, 
I enjoyed Dallas more than any.

10:42.310 --> 10:58.411
Fort Worth was a little rougher because the people 
at Fort Worth, some of the people at Fort Worth in

10:42.310 --> 10:58.411
the nightclubs where we used to go were a little 
rougher than the ones in Dallas and some of our boys

10:42.310 --> 10:58.411
got beat up pretty bad in fights up there at Fort 
Worth. But I enjoyed Dallas the best and I guess

10:58.431 --> 11:08.284
Houston next and then Fort Worth and then Wake up. 
Austin.

11:11.763 --> 11:22.533
I never did, I went to Austin for the 1940 game when 
we got beat, when we were supposed to go to the Rose

11:11.763 --> 11:22.533
Bowl. Then in 41, fall of 41 we played here. I didn't 
go to too many of those portraits in Austin. The,

11:30.920 --> 11:37.326
did you see much of those famous Aggie 
footballers? on campus? Were they? I saw them all

11:41.855 --> 11:44.078
the time. Who were your favorites as people? As 
people?

11:51.407 --> 11:58.816
Well, I admired and I thought a great deal of John 
Kimball. I

11:59.036 --> 12:04.242
had a little argument a few days ago, maybe you were 
bothered about John Kimball. Somebody said he

12:08.041 --> 12:11.226
wasn't a very good student. No, no, no. I said, I 
don't think that's so. They said, oh, everybody

12:15.472 --> 12:17.655
had to help him go through. And I said, well, I sat in 
chemistry class with John, and he didn't have any

12:17.675 --> 12:23.464
trouble whatsoever. He was a principal fellow. 
That's what I heard. And I knew Tommy Baum very

12:26.769 --> 12:29.393
well. He was kind of a wild monkey, but a hell of a 
good guy. Howard Shelton, who was my company

12:33.449 --> 12:46.549
commander, was an electrical engineering 
student, and a member of the Scholarship Honor

12:33.449 --> 12:46.549
Society, and played football. And there's Cullen 
Rogers, who was in A Company, and then later on,

12:48.492 --> 13:00.250
close to him, and I knew Martin Ruby, and I knew

13:01.276 --> 13:08.844
Jim Sterling. I knew Roy Bluchek. I knew Darius 
Mosier. I knew Bill Panacher.

13:18.233 --> 13:24.159
I was in summer camp at Camp Willis in San Antonio 
with Bill Panacher. Matter of fact, I rode home

13:24.179 --> 13:27.823
with him when he went from San Antonio to Denison. 
He was from Denison. Denison, yellow jacket.

13:33.253 --> 13:39.422
Yeah, and he let me out in Dallas and I caught a ride 
some way to Greenville. But I was, we all were

13:39.442 --> 13:41.585
close. That football team was very popular among 
the students and they weren't standoffish. Where

13:47.293 --> 13:50.217
did the athletes live then? Well, earlier

13:50.237 --> 13:55.845
they lived in Walden Hall. But then when they built 
the new dorms, They moved in dorm 12.

14:05.369 --> 14:06.851
The band was in dorm 11. Duncan Hall in the middle, 
dorm 12 over here, and the football players were

14:07.813 --> 14:14.282
there. Of all the student leadership positions 
when you were a student, which ones carried the

14:14.462 --> 14:21.813
most prestige? The cadet colonel. The cadet 
colonel was the number one student of the corps and

14:24.554 --> 14:32.446
the student body. The second was probably the 
president of the senior class. And then it

14:37.934 --> 14:52.857
probably went to the regimental command, like the 
top man in the infantry, the top man in the

14:37.934 --> 14:52.857
artillery, the top man in the coast, the top man in 
the capital. Band was highly regarded? Band was

14:56.750 --> 14:58.052
highly regarded. The commanders of the band, they 
had an infantry band, an artillery band, and a

14:58.433 --> 15:05.044
total band commander. They were highly respected 
and considered leaders. Did y'all have a nickname

15:08.509 --> 15:10.052
for the band? No, just the Aggie band. They had a, 
what they called it, a white band and a maroon band.

15:17.316 --> 15:20.800
And one was the artillery and one was the infantry. 
And it was about 200 pieces or a little less and a

15:20.820 --> 15:25.605
pretty good band. Did y'all think then of them as 
being very, very good at their marching routine of

15:25.625 --> 15:31.072
games? We thought they were the best in the world. 
We were proud of them. We were proud of the Ross

15:34.906 --> 15:36.828
Volunteers. We thought they were a neat outfit, 
though it was not a large organization. We were

15:41.674 --> 15:43.256
proud of them. Were there singing cadets then? 
Yes. Were they called that? Yes, they were called

15:45.959 --> 15:47.581
singing cadets. Mr. Joe Lookit was the head of the 
singing cadets. And Buck Weiris was a part member

15:54.569 --> 15:58.674
of the singing cadets. That's what was Pete Adams, 
my friend, who got killed in Brian. And we felt like

16:04.049 --> 16:08.115
they were very, very good. We're getting near the 
end now. What creates Aggie spirit? What creates

16:19.311 --> 16:22.836
Aggie pride? I

16:22.856 --> 16:33.010
think what you run into on the campus, what you see 
that happens on the campus day and night. You see

16:33.698 --> 16:45.253
things done that you wouldn't expect and you have a 
great appreciation for the fact that it happened

16:33.698 --> 16:45.253
that way. And it therefore creates a spirit, a 
feeling. Are there any events that are key to that?

16:55.626 --> 16:58.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The band as it plays. the 
marches, the silver taps, the mustard, all add

17:02.926 --> 17:16.103
factors to that. But I think that the spirit, the 
actual spirit comes with the basic fundamental of

17:16.124 --> 17:32.325
how you were treated and how you were respected and 
how you were handled while you were on the campus.

17:33.976 --> 17:36.400
Were you mistreated? When you needed help, were 
you assisted? Did your faculty, did your teachers

17:41.569 --> 17:46.818
laugh at you or did they help you? When you needed 
help, who'd you go to and how did they meet your

17:46.838 --> 17:52.689
problem? And those little things that you 
probably I you know if I had to sit down and write

17:57.365 --> 18:26.342
what what the Aggie spirit is I couldn't think of 
the damn thing but I'm sure maybe but I think it's

17:57.365 --> 18:26.342
just a combination of all those things to the point 
when it was all over it was there I mean it was there

17:57.365 --> 18:26.342
and it just gave you a feeling that well this has 
been such a wonderful experience I hope it'll last

17:57.365 --> 18:26.342
for eternity And I hope that I'll be able to do 
something to kind of repay. Okay, that's the next

18:35.145 --> 18:36.387
question. Yeah. Let's make believe that somebody 
gives you a million dollars. Yeah. And the only

18:42.135 --> 18:49.526
condition is you've got to give it to A&M and you 
decide what's going to be done with it. Yeah. What

18:50.207 --> 18:53.151
would you want it done with? Where would it, what 
area or what? Well, I think I would not give it for

18:57.490 --> 19:06.044
anything physical.

19:06.064 --> 19:13.095
I think if I could, I would say I want this for 
scholarships.

19:14.437 --> 19:15.179
Any particular thing? Not any. I don't have any 
right now. I wouldn't want to particularly

19:20.086 --> 19:23.532
restrict it to... in any particular field, I think 
I would want to say, I want you to give this

19:24.743 --> 19:35.632
scholarship to somebody who meets certain 
criteria, one of which would be a need. I wouldn't

19:36.893 --> 19:42.058
want a scholarship to go to a boy or girl, I wouldn't 
restrict it to a boy. A boy or a girl, whatever

19:42.078 --> 19:48.103
agenda or whatever color, I wouldn't care. But 
somebody who needed it, but on the other side,

19:48.984 --> 19:54.008
somebody who could make it. But some little help, 
you know. And then I might want to set up an award for

19:58.012 --> 20:01.055
a teacher. And I wouldn't care what field of 
teacher. I would think I would want one that would

20:04.779 --> 20:12.206
be recognized for his student relationships. I 
would want to recognize a teacher not because he

20:12.226 --> 20:22.877
was the best biochemist in the world, but because 
he did more for students than anybody else. And so

20:22.897 --> 20:24.619
that's what I do. Next

20:25.308 --> 20:29.593
to last.

20:32.297 --> 20:36.361
What did it mean to you in your life that you went 
here instead of somewhere else? Everything.

20:39.345 --> 20:39.706
Everything. I could, like I say, I could have gone 
to Texas Tech and I think I could have gone to

20:41.127 --> 20:49.898
University of Texas. I graduated with a pretty 
high honors up in Greenville and I could have

20:50.907 --> 20:58.857
gotten into any school I guess in Texas. But I just 
had a desire to come to this school and never

20:58.877 --> 21:11.872
regretted it one bit of one single time. And it's 
just meant everything to me. And I mean no

21:19.443 --> 21:29.317
disrespect to the other institutions, because 
I'm a believer of higher education, wherever it

21:19.443 --> 21:29.317
comes from. But this school, and I think really the 
thing that makes me feel so strong to the

21:31.339 --> 21:47.762
institution,

21:31.339 --> 21:47.762
for the fact that I, all of them, And I'm not talking 
about just the classroom teacher. I'm talking

21:51.127 --> 21:54.530
about the people in the dining hall. I'm talking 
about the wives of the faculty that I came to know.

22:01.757 --> 22:18.492
And I'm talking about the administrators, the 
staff, the deans, the student relationship

22:01.757 --> 22:18.492
people, the TAC officers,

22:01.757 --> 22:18.492
the people that worked in the in the buildings. 
Just everybody around here seemed to have a

22:21.313 --> 22:30.303
feeling about being helpful to me. And those were 
important to me.

22:37.311 --> 22:39.013
I can't answer your question. I don't know. The 
last question is almost repetitive. What

22:42.897 --> 22:46.521
feelings do you have in your heart for Indiana? Oh, 
super. Super. I think so much for it that I worry

22:48.762 --> 22:52.606
about it. I want it to be as good as I think it was at 
the base. And I'm not sure it's as good as it was. But

23:02.235 --> 23:09.843
I don't mean to say that I'm not highly supportive 
of the administration and what's been done. I

23:10.764 --> 23:15.528
think the girls, I think it was time to bring the 
girls in. I think they deserved it. I think it was

23:17.905 --> 23:20.308
time to let the blacks come in. They could make it 
more power to them. I think it was time that this

23:24.473 --> 23:29.578
corps be optional. You either be in the corps or you 
don't. If you want to go the fraternity route, go

23:33.002 --> 23:36.046
ahead. If you want to do something else, go ahead. 
But I just think, now sometimes, to be honest, I

23:40.291 --> 23:47.659
think we do some bad, good things. But I don't make a 
case

23:48.668 --> 23:55.962
out of it. But I don't let those things bother

23:57.986 --> 24:05.901
me. Let's quit there. Let's go.
