WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:02.895
May 15.

00:03.095 --> 00:04.857
Testing on May 15.

00:07.660 --> 00:09.603
Testing 2 on May 15.

00:09.783 --> 00:11.725
Testing 2 on May 15.

00:15.570 --> 00:17.692
Now we're testing for the second time.

00:17.793 --> 00:18.854
Testing, testing.

00:20.276 --> 00:21.717
What would you like for me to say?

00:23.660 --> 00:25.262
This is May 15.

00:25.402 --> 00:31.489
We're in 207 in the Evans Library, and I have the honor and pleasure of chatting

00:31.773 --> 00:39.246
with Dr. Ralph Zangaro, distinguished professor of chemistry, about his experiences here at A&M.

00:40.648 --> 00:48.482
To introduce yourself to anybody that might hear this tape or read a transcription, give us a biographical summary

00:49.087 --> 00:50.369
Oh, a brief summary.

00:51.030 --> 00:52.532
Yeah, before you came to A&M.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.234
This will be chronological.

00:54.254 --> 01:00.402
Yeah, where, you know, family background, and what did mom and dad do, and growing up, and where'd you go to school, and all that.

01:00.823 --> 01:01.464
Well, I'll do that.

01:01.484 --> 01:03.847
That's no problem.

01:03.867 --> 01:16.444
I was born and raised in New York City, specifically in Bensonhurst, if you've ever heard of it, which is the Italian conclave of New York City.

01:18.196 --> 01:24.282
My mother was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, but she was taken to Italy when she was three years old.

01:25.304 --> 01:44.524
My father came to the United States when he was about fifteen and I remember him telling me that he landed in New Haven, Connecticut where he had some family connections and got on the train and went to Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where he got a job in the paper mill shoveling lime and if you've ever dealt with

01:44.858 --> 01:50.084
anhydrous lime, you can appreciate what a most unpleasant job that is.

01:50.185 --> 01:55.271
At any rate, he married my mother and she came back to this country and they bought a house.

01:55.291 --> 02:08.047
He at that time relocated with respect both to geography and work, and actually for the good many years, until World War II, worked in a shoe factory.

02:08.407 --> 02:08.668
Where?

02:09.228 --> 02:10.089
In New York City.

02:10.250 --> 02:10.630
In the city.

02:11.065 --> 02:14.250
It was a very, they made high-class women's shoes.

02:15.212 --> 02:19.339
Well, there's a lot of interesting story goes with that, but I'm going to skip it.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.006
But I came from a very traditional Italian family.

02:23.026 --> 02:30.558
In other words, the mother stayed home, did the cooking, washing, ironing, et cetera, kept the house clean and raised the kids.

02:30.579 --> 02:32.081
How many boys and girls?

02:32.101 --> 02:36.128
There were two, we were five, three boys, two girls.

02:37.154 --> 03:00.478
I went to New York City public schools, and interestingly, public school and high school is interesting in the sense that I was always in the company of a large contingent of Jewish students, because adjoining Bensonhurst is a region called Bay Ridge, pardon me, Bay Ridge is there, but this is Borough Park is the

03:01.184 --> 03:03.928
Jewish location, so I got there.

03:03.968 --> 03:12.720
My father would always say, watch the Jewish kids, because they're very interested in education and learning, and they set a good example for you.

03:12.740 --> 03:23.535
And that was a very good example, but at any rate, we didn't have much money, but we always loved, and they were lacking for a sense of security, and plenty to eat, that sort of thing.

03:24.296 --> 03:29.824
But he said, but he kept telling me, if I'm going to go to college, there's only one place I can go, that was the City College in New York,

03:30.530 --> 03:31.852
Which was free.

03:32.293 --> 03:34.256
I went to New Utrecht High School.

03:34.276 --> 03:35.978
New Utrecht.

03:36.579 --> 03:47.336
And I was, now at the time I went, I was admitted in 1941, New Utrecht City College of New York was a strictly scholarship high school.

03:47.376 --> 03:57.111
There were just so many places and you took some exams, they looked at your records, et cetera, and then once they reached the 1500 or the number they admitted to freshman, that was it.

03:57.665 --> 03:59.407
It's changed drastically since then.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.829
It's now an open university.

04:00.909 --> 04:07.157
How diverse, meaning how varied, was the City College student body?

04:07.638 --> 04:17.991
The City College student body was largely Jewish, but that's the first place throughout my education in New York City that I ever came in contact with blacks.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.314
Prior to that through

04:20.716 --> 04:26.366
public school, junior high school, high school, I had never known a black man, never.

04:26.887 --> 04:29.872
At City College there were some blacks.

04:29.892 --> 04:33.839
And it's located in Harlem, 137th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.

04:34.600 --> 04:39.589
So when I got off the subway, it was an hour and 15 minute subway to and back.

04:39.669 --> 04:41.953
At any rate, it was a great education.

04:42.834 --> 04:43.956
It didn't cost me anything.

04:44.780 --> 04:47.164
Now did your parents encourage you to go to college?

04:47.385 --> 04:49.629
Very much so, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:49.649 --> 04:53.877
We all did, except one sister didn't go to college but she went to nursing school.

04:54.578 --> 04:58.485
And when did you begin to think about what your major would be?

04:59.387 --> 05:07.902
Probably as a junior, not until I was a junior, did I sign up for a chemistry major.

05:08.877 --> 05:21.112
I had asthma and I took off when I was about 18 for Arizona where I finished one semester at the University of Arizona and I disliked Arizona with a passion for a very simple reason, it never rained.

05:21.532 --> 05:23.495
That made me very, very despondent.

05:23.795 --> 05:30.883
I really was praying for some rain and just the smell and freshness of a rainstorm.

05:30.903 --> 05:35.509
So I went back and this was 1946, my brothers were back from the

05:35.692 --> 05:37.535
having served in the armed forces.

05:37.735 --> 05:45.025
My two brothers, they were older than I. And I just sort of randomly applied to graduate school.

05:45.085 --> 05:47.669
I ended up at the University of Kansas.

05:47.709 --> 05:50.894
Now you had graduated at City College in what year?

05:50.974 --> 05:52.155
Yes, 46.

05:52.696 --> 05:53.257
In chemistry?

05:53.277 --> 05:54.379
In chemistry, yeah.

05:54.659 --> 05:56.822
Then went out to Arizona for a graduate

05:57.055 --> 05:57.896
No, no.

05:58.237 --> 06:02.564
I had not completed my undergraduate work at City College.

06:02.584 --> 06:03.686
I had one more semester.

06:04.627 --> 06:19.812
And I shan't go into my adventures in Arizona because I had a job, well, heck, compared, where I worked six days a week from five till two, that's how many hours a day, seven hours, no, it's more than that.

06:20.473 --> 06:21.555
It's nine hours, isn't it?

06:21.575 --> 06:23.738
From five in the afternoon to two in the morning.

06:24.173 --> 06:26.695
And I got paid $25 every two weeks.

06:27.876 --> 06:36.804
But I managed to save $400 out of that, which helped me get through college, pay my tuition at the University of Arizona, which was a pleasant place.

06:36.944 --> 06:37.505
I enjoyed it.

06:38.325 --> 06:52.538
So then when I got back to New York City, it was spring of 46, and I applied to graduate school, and I ended up going to the University of Kansas, which I was just so surprised to see what a beautiful campus that was.

06:52.778 --> 06:54.079
It's a lovely place.

06:54.599 --> 06:55.802
Well, I'm not going to go into detail.

06:55.822 --> 06:56.664
I got my degree.

06:57.325 --> 07:00.332
I met my wife there, a very pretty Kansas girl.

07:00.713 --> 07:02.717
We're still married after 52 years.

07:04.041 --> 07:09.673
And let's see, oh yeah, then I went to work for the Eastman Kodak Company.

07:09.713 --> 07:11.938
That was my first job in Rochester, New York.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.502
I was 25 years old.

07:14.832 --> 07:21.562
And I stayed there for two years and I think I did some very nice work and I got nothing but praise for the organization.

07:21.662 --> 07:22.884
They treated me well.

07:22.924 --> 07:24.826
It was a pleasant place to work.

07:24.846 --> 07:26.329
People treated me nicely.

07:26.369 --> 07:33.759
The people with whom I worked were good people in their professions and I enjoyed working with them.

07:34.460 --> 07:38.727
But I decided I was going to teach school.

07:38.767 --> 07:41.110
I went to the University of Arkansas for

07:41.512 --> 07:42.333
Not very long.

07:42.433 --> 07:44.635
I did not like Fayetteville, Arkansas.

07:44.655 --> 07:46.738
I thought it was terribly isolated.

07:48.019 --> 08:00.933
So I ended up getting another industrial job at the American Psy Animate Company in Winchester, Massachusetts, and they had an Atomic Energy Commission contract.

08:00.953 --> 08:07.941
After about a year, they said, well, the Atomic Energy Commission was not going to renew the contract, so we should look elsewhere for work.

08:08.798 --> 08:27.941
Now, the company itself was willing to relocate me within the company, but they wanted to send me to Bound Brook, New Jersey, the pigments division, which was very unexciting because the buildings were old, the dust was everywhere, and that's how I wrote to my professor when he told me about Texas A&M had a job opening.

08:29.322 --> 08:30.283
And that's what got me here.

08:31.385 --> 08:35.970
Now, your special area of emphasis in chemistry was what?

08:37.216 --> 08:41.901
Well, inorganic chemistry, but specifically what we call metalloids.

08:41.961 --> 08:50.811
I got interested in metalloids at Eastman Kodak working with selenium, which is a metalloid element.

08:52.012 --> 08:56.257
So I came to Texas and came by way of Buffalo.

08:56.457 --> 08:58.819
There were no interstates at the time, I don't believe.

08:59.961 --> 09:03.004
I had one daughter, a year old daughter at the time.

09:03.575 --> 09:07.159
And so here I am since 1954.

09:07.179 --> 09:19.351
Now, when I first got here, I was a little bit shocked at the teaching load we had, because we met with our students 13 hours a week.

09:19.371 --> 09:28.620
Lecture, large lecture of groups of about 100, and then that was broken down to smaller groups of 20 each, where we just met them, and it was

09:28.955 --> 09:35.525
Gave them assignments, went over problems, and got to know the students quite well on an individual basis, which I thought was very nice.

09:35.565 --> 09:38.991
Of course, at the time, they were all in the Corps.

09:39.772 --> 09:40.754
There was another girl there.

09:41.074 --> 09:42.977
Now, this is the fall of 40?

09:43.438 --> 09:43.899
No, 54.

09:43.919 --> 09:44.740
54.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.782
Okay.

09:46.182 --> 09:50.389
As you were doing your homework about Texas A&M,

09:50.639 --> 09:55.467
What did you think Texas A&M was like before you got here?

09:55.747 --> 09:56.608
I had no idea.

09:56.869 --> 10:04.281
I had no idea for the simple reason that I didn't get to know about the school until April, late April.

10:04.922 --> 10:07.125
That's too late to apply for a teaching job.

10:07.626 --> 10:08.327
It's too late.

10:08.628 --> 10:13.412
And my professor at the University of Kansas said that this is available.

10:14.033 --> 10:16.976
I've written a good letter of recommendation, so if you want it, you can have it.

10:16.996 --> 10:20.799
So I didn't have that much leeway in seeking another job.

10:20.819 --> 10:26.324
When you came, and this is the only dollar question I'm going to ask you, what was your beginning salary?

10:26.825 --> 10:30.168
I don't remember exactly, but it was in the neighborhood of $400 to $425 a month.

10:30.188 --> 10:32.309
That was... Nine months or 12 months apart?

10:32.630 --> 10:34.051
Nine months.

10:34.111 --> 10:34.732
Nine months.

10:35.432 --> 10:36.273
Yeah.

10:36.293 --> 10:38.415
And who was the person...

10:38.767 --> 10:41.870
that contacted you for the department?

10:41.890 --> 10:44.693
Fred Jensen, who was the head of the department.

10:44.933 --> 10:45.114
J-E-N?

10:45.214 --> 10:45.774
J-E-N-S-E-N.

10:46.155 --> 10:47.096
A very nice man.

10:47.116 --> 10:48.317
He was the department head.

10:48.617 --> 10:53.382
Describe the department's makeup.

10:53.442 --> 10:55.424
Who was here in chemistry then?

10:55.845 --> 10:56.746
Oh, my heavens.

10:56.786 --> 11:01.991
The ones that were here then, there was Errol Middleton.

11:02.271 --> 11:04.574
Errol Bathurst Middleton was his name.

11:04.594 --> 11:05.955
George Mario Watson.

11:06.863 --> 11:09.507
And George left shortly after I came.

11:09.527 --> 11:11.250
He was a very, very good chemist.

11:11.270 --> 11:15.456
He went on to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and I kept in touch with him many years.

11:15.536 --> 11:19.341
A fine man and a very fine chemist.

11:19.402 --> 11:20.944
Thomas Burkhalter was here.

11:21.004 --> 11:24.229
And those are some I remember.

11:25.050 --> 11:27.634
Gosh, there are a good many others, but those are the ones I remember.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.817
But one gentleman I do remember, I'm still

11:30.303 --> 11:31.224
Stay in touch with him.

11:31.284 --> 11:39.657
He was not a faculty member, but Pete Rodriguez, a great guy, just a wonderful individual, just a really good person.

11:39.757 --> 11:41.239
What was Pete's duties then?

11:41.700 --> 11:44.464
He was, I would say, administrative assistant.

11:44.705 --> 11:54.379
In other words, he looked to see that the labs were, if they were told that lab needs a paint job, he'd communicate with the people on campus to get the painters over.

11:54.920 --> 11:59.787
If somebody had to move some books or something, he, so that's the kind of thing he did if you needed

12:00.256 --> 12:04.241
chemicals and they were not available, he ordered them for you, that kind of thing.

12:04.341 --> 12:07.385
Just a, really, just a first class individual.

12:07.565 --> 12:08.747
Was John Beckham in there?

12:08.767 --> 12:12.391
John Beckham was very, he was the department head's right hand man.

12:13.072 --> 12:14.894
He would make out teaching schedules.

12:16.356 --> 12:22.284
He would, like John Taft taught also, he met classes.

12:22.684 --> 12:24.446
Dr. Harrington was no longer in the department.

12:24.466 --> 12:26.469
No, Harrington was gone at that time, M.T.

12:26.489 --> 12:27.730
Harrington, he was gone.

12:28.011 --> 12:29.773
Yeah, I remember that.

12:30.293 --> 12:33.698
describe the chemistry facilities, the chemistry buildings?

12:33.758 --> 12:44.032
Well, at the time, the only building there, we've got such an extensive facility now, was what we call the old, the original chemistry building, built about 1930, 32, under the WPA.

12:46.435 --> 12:59.794
But as far as research, I was just greatly disappointed, because there are no research facilities, virtually no, there were a few graduate students that were just initiating a graduate program.

13:00.584 --> 13:10.736
But I was not impressed, let me put it that way, because the department was strictly really a service department.

13:12.078 --> 13:16.683
When you got here, how long did you think you would probably stay at Texas A&M?

13:17.564 --> 13:25.794
Well, I must admit, I didn't think I would stay very long because I had job offers during the first four or five years.

13:25.894 --> 13:27.756
Every year I had a job offer somewhere.

13:28.394 --> 13:29.315
I don't know.

13:29.355 --> 13:32.560
Then you're talking about some very personal psychological problems.

13:32.801 --> 13:35.104
I had changed jobs three, four times.

13:35.164 --> 13:39.932
I felt I'd better settle down somewhere and prove that I can do something at one place.

13:40.232 --> 13:46.542
Describe moving wife and family and- That I was very, very lucky.

13:46.562 --> 13:47.383
Very lucky.

13:47.503 --> 13:53.052
Because I worked for the American Scientist Company, a product company, and that was the Atomic Energy Commission Government Project.

13:53.740 --> 13:59.171
So they moved me from where I was in Arkansas, they paid for that, to Washington.

13:59.993 --> 14:06.205
I mean, well not Washington, it was a town in Massachusetts, Winchester.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.893
And then, since they had lost their contract,

14:10.818 --> 14:14.926
I got all my expenses paid moving from Winchester to College Station.

14:16.248 --> 14:17.210
I was very lucky.

14:17.550 --> 14:18.552
Now what did you all move?

14:18.612 --> 14:19.955
How much furniture and stuff?

14:19.975 --> 14:21.558
Well, just a very modest amount.

14:21.678 --> 14:22.981
You know, just standard stuff.

14:23.001 --> 14:24.323
It was not a lot of stuff.

14:24.343 --> 14:27.429
Describe finding a place for you and your family to live.

14:27.549 --> 14:30.835
Well, that was pretty easy because there was apartments that are gone now.

14:31.523 --> 14:35.470
that we were told about, and it was very cheap, 45 bucks a month.

14:35.571 --> 14:37.374
Over at Southgate, on the south side of the camp?

14:37.394 --> 14:41.843
Oh, you remember where the drive-in used to be there, where the churches are located now?

14:41.863 --> 14:42.865
Oh, up at Northgate.

14:43.145 --> 14:46.131
Northgate, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, in that neighborhood.

14:46.151 --> 14:47.934
Who else lived in those apartments?

14:47.974 --> 14:48.575
Were they most of them?

14:48.756 --> 14:54.747
Oh, no, interestingly, most of the residents there were Army officers, because the Air Force Base,

14:55.402 --> 15:01.211
where we have our adjunct campus now, still was in operation.

15:01.231 --> 15:05.318
So almost everyone was an Army officer, and they were nice people to have around.

15:05.358 --> 15:08.423
They were very sociable, very friendly, and we got to know them quite well.

15:08.744 --> 15:15.935
How were you and your wife received by the department and others in the neighborhood?

15:16.356 --> 15:19.742
Oh, now, as far as that's concerned, everyone was extremely friendly.

15:19.862 --> 15:22.506
I mean, they tried their best to make us feel at home.

15:23.684 --> 15:31.458
Give some examples of a New Yorker moving to this almost rural area.

15:31.518 --> 15:34.403
What did you have to learn about Texas?

15:34.484 --> 15:38.631
Well, like I say, I was born and raised in Bensonhurst.

15:38.731 --> 15:43.600
It's an Italian neighborhood and we could put great emphasis on food.

15:44.778 --> 15:48.181
basic and integral part of the Italian culture, eating well.

15:49.002 --> 15:55.588
So one of the things I missed was a lack of decent restaurants and very, very nice grocery stores.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.852
The grocery store situation, I don't know if you recollect at that time, was virtually nonexistent.

16:02.194 --> 16:03.295
That was a real let down.

16:03.635 --> 16:05.476
Orr's was probably the closest.

16:05.496 --> 16:07.438
That's about the only one also.

16:07.779 --> 16:13.924
And about the only restaurant was, gosh, the place that's out of business now where they had, they used to call it Blood

16:15.254 --> 16:16.155
Oh, heavens.

16:17.117 --> 16:22.565
It's funny because one of the subsequent graduate students, Bloodhound, he called it, Youngbloods.

16:22.685 --> 16:23.146
Youngbloods.

16:23.206 --> 16:24.407
Youngbloods, right.

16:24.427 --> 16:26.270
They call it the Bloodhound.

16:26.290 --> 16:27.292
Yeah, yeah.

16:27.312 --> 16:28.974
But that was about the only place.

16:28.994 --> 16:32.439
And a little after that, Clayton's Open, where the bank is now.

16:33.180 --> 16:35.183
And he ran a pretty decent shop there.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.507
It was okay.

16:37.527 --> 16:40.411
And let's see, what kind of automobiles did you have?

16:40.832 --> 16:41.332
Oh, heavens.

16:41.412 --> 16:41.753
I had it.

16:41.773 --> 16:43.135
When I came here, was it a...

16:43.807 --> 16:45.289
It was a 53 Dodge.

16:45.970 --> 16:48.072
Yeah that's what it was, 53 Dodge.

16:48.613 --> 16:49.173
Pretty good.

16:50.014 --> 16:54.300
And what were your, do you remember your first year's duties?

16:55.081 --> 16:56.522
Oh heavens, well yeah.

16:57.043 --> 17:01.308
Like I said we had met with our students 13 hours a week.

17:01.508 --> 17:01.949
What courses?

17:01.969 --> 17:05.393
And in addition to that, in addition we had labs.

17:05.862 --> 17:07.984
What courses were you teaching at first?

17:08.404 --> 17:14.610
Just freshman, and then once a year they had me teaching a senior inorganic course.

17:14.630 --> 17:17.412
Did they make any promises to you about the future?

17:18.293 --> 17:18.994
No.

17:19.014 --> 17:24.018
No, no, and I was just disillusioned the first number of years, I must say.

17:24.379 --> 17:27.822
I had one good outlet, though, and I'll get to that when you're ready for it.

17:28.342 --> 17:28.703
Go ahead.

17:29.023 --> 17:29.463
Oh, okay.

17:30.024 --> 17:32.306
Now, since we had a nine-month appointment, summer was free.

17:32.666 --> 17:34.688
I had worked with American Cyanimate Company,

17:35.242 --> 17:44.531
I worked with what was called the Minerals Dressing Division, and they were working on uranium ores, extracting uranium from its ores.

17:45.712 --> 18:03.088
So I had learned about the Association of Western Universities or something like that at Oak Ridge, so I applied, and that experience of American Cyanamid, they put me on for the summer, and that was a great connection because it kept my hand and my mind alive in research.

18:03.372 --> 18:05.818
And I got to know some very good chemists there.

18:05.878 --> 18:08.124
How long did you go up there in the summers?

18:08.525 --> 18:09.447
Just three months.

18:09.467 --> 18:12.093
But subsequent to that I had three more summers.

18:12.996 --> 18:20.554
Then I spent two years as a temporary employee at the laboratory.

18:21.040 --> 18:25.328
And then I spent one more year as a National Science Foundation fellow at the laboratories.

18:25.388 --> 18:27.812
I had seven years total at Oak Ridge Laboratory.

18:28.374 --> 18:29.536
I enjoyed the terrain.

18:29.616 --> 18:32.581
I mean East Tennessee is very beautiful, very beautiful.

18:32.701 --> 18:41.698
And the laboratory was absolutely first class with respect to personnel who were very competent.

18:42.337 --> 19:06.589
and uh facilities which were first class so it was a great thing for me for a newcomer was there any social life for for the chemistry families well people would invite you to their homes occasionally i can't don't recollect any departmental affairs who were particularly uh thoughtful to you and your wife tom burkhalter got to know him quite well although he left not

19:06.940 --> 19:12.900
The morning after I got there he went to Texas Instruments, and George Watson,

19:13.252 --> 19:17.697
He was there for about five years, but he would go out periodically.

19:17.738 --> 19:22.063
George was married to a Mexican, no, he was not married to a Mexican lady.

19:22.103 --> 19:26.648
His mother was Mexican, so he was a Mexican wasp is what he was.

19:26.689 --> 19:30.053
And George was a very sociable type.

19:30.073 --> 19:34.338
We'd go to Mexican restaurants in Tanzarapes when it was outdoors.

19:34.358 --> 19:35.599
I don't know if you recollect that.

19:35.620 --> 19:38.483
We'd go there quite often.

19:39.307 --> 19:47.657
In those first year or two when you were living in the apartment, describe your typical day's routine.

19:48.058 --> 19:51.522
What time did you get up and how did you get over here and what did you do during the day?

19:52.163 --> 19:55.747
Well, I was at school all day, although we typically start at 8 o'clock.

19:55.767 --> 19:56.548
Did you walk over?

19:57.990 --> 19:58.371
I don't.

19:58.951 --> 20:01.054
Part of the time, my life would take me over.

20:01.074 --> 20:03.417
And then parking was difficult then also.

20:05.139 --> 20:05.780
But it was close.

20:05.900 --> 20:06.881
It was very close.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.503
I mean, it was just a 10-minute walk.

20:09.766 --> 20:17.117
Well, we had two, you know, one kid and my second child didn't come until 57, so it was a few years later.

20:17.137 --> 20:26.612
But we had a hell of a lot to do at school because we did not have the photocopying or secretarial help that we have currently.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.496
Maybe we'd have to often do our own typing.

20:29.797 --> 20:34.343
run off on mimeograph machines, our exams and handouts and such.

20:34.844 --> 20:36.927
So I was pretty darn busy all day long.

20:37.307 --> 20:40.672
And, let's see, this was your first academic appointment?

20:40.692 --> 20:41.052
Yeah.

20:41.393 --> 20:43.015
So you had to work on lectures?

20:43.836 --> 20:44.337
That's right.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.899
You'd sit down and prepare your lectures.

20:45.999 --> 20:48.182
That was not too bad, though.

20:48.403 --> 20:51.927
Did you have a personal office, or did you have to share it?

20:52.068 --> 20:53.129
Well, it varied.

20:53.429 --> 20:58.977
At times I would share it with, I remember I'd promote SARMA, was my...

21:00.560 --> 21:07.767
My office partner, I smiled a little bit because he was a homeopathy, these guys that deal with it.

21:07.787 --> 21:13.412
When you take tiny amounts, it's supposed to, you know, he had these drawers full of these damn things.

21:13.472 --> 21:14.973
He was a good guy.

21:15.374 --> 21:21.900
And did you have, didn't have teaching assistants then, did you?

21:21.920 --> 21:26.985
No, we didn't have teaching assistants because the graduate program was, for all practical purposes, nonexistent.

21:28.386 --> 21:29.487
And where'd you eat lunch?

21:30.749 --> 21:32.632
Gosh, I forget.

21:33.533 --> 21:36.117
I don't remember exactly, to tell you the truth.

21:36.657 --> 21:38.380
You don't remember whether you brought a brown bag or not?

21:38.400 --> 21:43.207
I used to bring it sometimes, but not always, or else I'd just skip and wait until I got home at night.

21:44.509 --> 21:47.833
And did you turn to anybody for advice?

21:47.973 --> 21:54.282
Was there some senior person that... Well, I'll tell you the truth.

21:54.463 --> 22:00.351
My feeling about the senior people, that they had such a provincial...

22:00.567 --> 22:05.713
traditional attitude about, in other words, there was no ambition.

22:06.715 --> 22:09.218
There was no, there weren't no research facilities.

22:09.238 --> 22:10.319
You can't blame these people.

22:11.220 --> 22:12.822
There were no planning for the future.

22:13.343 --> 22:17.788
And the few graduate students were working on their masters, not their doctoral.

22:17.808 --> 22:20.632
Well, they would, no, they were getting doctorates too.

22:20.652 --> 22:21.152
Oh, were they?

22:21.172 --> 22:21.273
Okay.

22:21.293 --> 22:22.554
Yeah, yeah.

22:22.574 --> 22:28.161
Did anybody attempt to give you guidelines or rules, tell you some do's and some don'ts?

22:28.883 --> 22:36.396
Mostly about schedules, you know, make sure you're back before the

22:36.781 --> 22:39.084
full session begins, things like that.

22:39.264 --> 22:42.828
But no, I didn't get much advice along those lines.

22:43.769 --> 22:44.750
All right.

22:44.770 --> 22:48.375
You weren't told, be here, stay at least till 5 o'clock?

22:48.415 --> 22:49.156
No, no, no, no, no.

22:49.176 --> 22:49.796
I never was told that.

22:49.816 --> 22:50.718
But I remember they had a whistle.

22:50.838 --> 22:52.319
They had one of those factory whistles.

22:52.420 --> 22:54.182
That, I recollect, yes.

22:54.502 --> 22:56.084
Yes, I remember the factory whistle.

22:57.325 --> 23:02.131
Who were the notable campus administrators when you first got here?

23:02.151 --> 23:02.872
Well, M.T.

23:02.912 --> 23:04.594
Harrington, I remember.

23:04.574 --> 23:07.778
was pretty much the big boys here.

23:07.978 --> 23:10.020
I don't even remember who the president was at that time.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.302
David Morgan, I think.

23:11.883 --> 23:17.069
Well, he was trying to change things, David Morgan, but I think they booted his ass out of here, didn't they?

23:18.010 --> 23:20.573
Yes, I think Morgan was trying to change this place.

23:20.853 --> 23:24.117
Since he was a chemist, did you get to see Dr. Harrington much?

23:24.738 --> 23:25.238
No, I didn't.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.343
But I'll say a little story about Dr. Harrington.

23:29.363 --> 23:33.568
Because when I first came, the first week I came was before classes began.

23:33.953 --> 23:35.377
We had orientation meetings.

23:37.142 --> 23:44.662
And the thing that struck me, being from the Northeast, was he made some remark that he tells us about Texas A&M University.

23:46.387 --> 23:49.515
And then, I can't quote him now, but he says, and then we have the

23:49.917 --> 23:55.924
term, the way he said it, I'm not sure, Negro or Negro, something like that, campus at Prairie View.

23:56.384 --> 24:01.591
And that kind of made me feel, gee whiz, what have I gotten myself into?

24:01.991 --> 24:08.499
These guys have a separate physical location for the blacks, you know.

24:09.460 --> 24:12.844
But now when you were at KU, Kansas was still segregated.

24:13.004 --> 24:14.225
Oh no, I don't believe so.

24:14.546 --> 24:14.946
Really?

24:15.584 --> 24:16.925
No.

24:16.945 --> 24:18.147
See, I went there right after the war.

24:18.948 --> 24:24.894
We were full of, you know, what do they call those people who had their way paid by the... G.I.

24:24.914 --> 24:25.274
Bill.

24:25.294 --> 24:25.655
G.I.

24:25.675 --> 24:28.478
Bill people, and blacks were on a football team.

24:29.338 --> 24:34.043
What were your first impressions of Aggie students that you had in class?

24:34.063 --> 24:36.526
Now, the students, I was greatly impressed with the students.

24:36.566 --> 24:41.271
They were always very, very personable, friendly.

24:41.943 --> 24:48.554
courteous, and then they never gave me any trouble, except a story that I'll relate to subsequently.

24:48.994 --> 24:59.952
No, my feeling was very favorable because as I say, they were friendly, courteous, and they never bitched about anything.

25:01.501 --> 25:04.204
They did their assignments, I thought, seriously.

25:04.645 --> 25:08.910
Did anybody tell you about how many needed to pass or fail?

25:08.930 --> 25:10.231
No, no, I never was told that.

25:10.311 --> 25:12.394
Honestly, I was never told such a thing.

25:13.495 --> 25:18.281
And, all right, describe your routine in class.

25:19.442 --> 25:22.025
Start a semester and finish it in those early years.

25:22.065 --> 25:22.485
What was it?

25:23.847 --> 25:26.390
What did you do the first day of class?

25:26.470 --> 25:30.715
Well, the thing I did at first was introduce myself and,

25:31.859 --> 25:40.888
told them about the course, what was expected of them, that they should, their homework would be turned in and it would play a serious part in their final grade.

25:41.769 --> 25:50.558
That my, you know, we had regular office hours and those told them, they'll be in my office at this time every day or whatever it was and you're welcome to come in.

25:50.578 --> 25:59.908
Any question you have, be it personal or an assignment question that you can't handle or with which you are having trouble, you're welcome.

26:00.783 --> 26:05.108
And as I say, the students always were, they never gave me a hard time.

26:05.188 --> 26:08.512
This, I think, is the feeling I got.

26:08.552 --> 26:13.217
Until one event, one event subsequent to this, this was when the place became co-ed.

26:13.618 --> 26:16.180
It's an interesting little story though.

26:16.841 --> 26:25.491
One, so, there was, when you got five sections, now the bad part about it,

26:25.555 --> 26:34.183
was each, the groups meant group of 100 and then jointly and then some sections of 20.

26:35.465 --> 26:39.629
And you give them an assignment, you go over it, you go through a certain routine of lecture.

26:40.109 --> 26:44.414
When I got to about the fourth time, it got terribly boring.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.116
I mean it was terribly boring.

26:48.257 --> 26:53.082
So by the time I got to going over the same material the fourth and fifth times,

26:53.585 --> 26:59.758
I felt that that particular group was getting shortchanged because my heart wasn't in it, it was just rote, just rote.

27:01.943 --> 27:07.575
At any rate, my relationships with the students were fine, there were no problems.

27:07.695 --> 27:09.259
And how capable were they?

27:10.080 --> 27:12.285
Well, on average they seemed quite good.

27:12.468 --> 27:17.194
You know, I thought their performance was quite acceptable.

27:17.854 --> 27:26.885
Do you have any stories about Country Boys or City Slickers trying to... Well, I remember one kid, to this day, I can't get over it.

27:26.905 --> 27:28.447
You know, we read off the cards.

27:28.487 --> 27:30.249
We had registration cards.

27:31.170 --> 27:34.934
And you go through the cards, you know, John Jones, Billy Brown, et cetera.

27:35.555 --> 27:39.340
And I got to this one, and I was terribly embarrassed because I made a mistake.

27:39.420 --> 27:41.462
Well, the card said Panty Joe.

27:42.185 --> 27:47.253
And I said to this boy, I said, is that correct?

27:48.055 --> 27:51.360
I says, they must have made a mistake in registering you.

27:52.502 --> 27:54.044
He says, no, that was his given name.

27:54.425 --> 27:57.189
P-A-N-T-Y-J-O-E.

27:58.031 --> 27:59.713
Panty Joe Pantormule.

27:59.794 --> 28:01.757
I still remember the kid, Pantormule.

28:05.222 --> 28:06.825
But at any rate, that's a real event.

28:07.261 --> 28:11.689
Did any of them try to give you excuses about a grandparent dying?

28:11.769 --> 28:12.210
No, no.

28:12.270 --> 28:14.194
The day before test or anything like that?

28:14.214 --> 28:15.436
I don't remember that.

28:16.438 --> 28:17.339
No, they were good.

28:17.359 --> 28:18.602
Their attendance was good.

28:19.363 --> 28:20.665
Did you grade on the curve?

28:22.408 --> 28:27.758
I think all, I don't know, I can't say all of us, but most of us kind of adjusted grades.

28:27.838 --> 28:31.024
You know, if a guy gets 67,

28:31.342 --> 28:32.023
You're liable.

28:32.043 --> 28:35.668
You're very likely to give him a C. But I just try to distribute it.

28:35.708 --> 28:40.755
If a guy gets a 56 or a 57, liable to pass him.

28:42.137 --> 28:46.563
If he gets an 88, liable to give him an A. Yes, I did that.

28:47.023 --> 28:47.223
All right.

28:47.243 --> 28:52.751
Now, basically, what majors were taking these introductory chemistry courses?

28:52.771 --> 28:56.556
Well, mostly the great majority were

28:57.177 --> 29:00.241
Agriculture and engineering.

29:00.642 --> 29:07.852
They're very, virtually all is my recollection, because those were the big colleges here at the time.

29:08.954 --> 29:10.236
Ag was very big.

29:12.098 --> 29:22.273
What do you think you told your wife about, after the first few weeks, what do you think you told your wife about what it was like to be a faculty member at the A&M College of Texas?

29:23.047 --> 29:25.329
Well, I don't think I told them much, actually.

29:25.349 --> 29:28.592
I didn't want, she had a little kid take care of, I didn't want to upset her.

29:28.632 --> 29:41.444
I wasn't too, didn't feel like I had a great prestige job, that's for sure, because I had been to City College, I had been to the University of Kansas, and the way things were done there were just vastly different.

29:41.604 --> 29:51.653
I mean, this, this was just like a, I don't know how to put it, but like a school, like they said at the time, to train men for the armed forces.

29:52.763 --> 29:57.873
I was not aware of a great deal of scholarship or certainly was not much research going on.

29:58.414 --> 30:00.919
Now, your title, were you an assistant professor?

30:00.939 --> 30:02.422
Assistant professor, I came as assistant.

30:02.442 --> 30:05.508
And we didn't have a tenure system then, so that wasn't a factor.

30:06.330 --> 30:12.342
At the end of the first year or so, were there salary increases?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.094
Oh, very, if any, they were very modest.

30:15.134 --> 30:21.223
I remember once we weren't getting paid, and they said, you're going to get warrants, which the state would make good subsequently.

30:21.284 --> 30:22.285
I remember that event.

30:23.807 --> 30:26.431
But I never was paid really well.

30:26.852 --> 30:31.959
To this day, I'd still like to make 100 grand a year, which I've never achieved.

30:31.979 --> 30:34.683
But one very important thing happened to me.

30:35.184 --> 30:36.266
It came in 54.

30:37.187 --> 30:39.831
I had been to Oak Ridge and worked with those people.

30:41.144 --> 30:49.452
In 58 I received a research grant from the Atomic Energy Commission.

30:49.472 --> 30:56.018
Luckily for me because I had worked in an area where I had some experience which was of interest to them.

30:56.178 --> 31:02.864
So that started me off on doing some real research and I got some graduate students then too.

31:03.525 --> 31:10.932
And a year or two later I got a Welch grant so I was doing quite well research wise.

31:11.401 --> 31:13.284
And we had quite a change.

31:13.404 --> 31:16.388
Well, let's see, Dr. Martell had not yet come on the scene.

31:16.829 --> 31:18.231
He had not yet come on the scene.

31:18.331 --> 31:20.574
Do you remember who preceded him as Department of Health?

31:20.594 --> 31:25.662
Well, there were a bunch, but we had some fellows who came for like a year, year and a half, like Swalinski.

31:25.682 --> 31:26.543
Yeah, yeah.

31:26.563 --> 31:27.144
Isbell.

31:27.785 --> 31:29.066
They didn't stay too long.

31:32.111 --> 31:34.354
Was Tex Isbell on the faculty when you got here?
