WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:31.000
planning principles as professionals and at the 
same time protecting our own jobs but we find that

00:01.533 --> 00:31.000
using the language ultimate is workable and 
acceptable and now although we haven't got an

00:01.533 --> 00:31.000
ultimate plan approved and I'm not sure if it's 
really necessary to approve it because we seem to

00:01.533 --> 00:31.000
be working with it well with other departments we 
are backtracking from that point since we've sold

00:01.533 --> 00:31.000
the idea of an ultimate development We're 
backtracking to going through some, developing

00:31.840 --> 00:37.146
some land use consumption rates or some growth 
rates. And what we're coming in and we're saying,

00:37.206 --> 00:46.678
and this is what we're doing right now, and it's 
what your interns will be working on this, my

00:37.206 --> 00:46.678
interns that goes, you know, you teach at school, 
we're working on this summer. We're doing land use

00:47.078 --> 00:50.903
consumption rates at A&M. Consumption rates, 
uh-huh. We're doing land use consumption rates.

00:53.245 --> 00:59.653
And what we're trying to do, we're going to impose 
some five-year timetables on when these uh...

01:00.511 --> 01:27.767
certain types of developments will occur based on 
the information that we have available you know

01:00.511 --> 01:27.767
including you know marketability of the land yeah 
based on assumptions of continued growth rates

01:00.511 --> 01:27.767
and so forth exactly and we think by using this 
approach that we may finally be able to sell

01:00.511 --> 01:27.767
through coming through sort of the back door 
approach a comprehensive plan for the city the

01:00.511 --> 01:27.767
city is becoming very cognizant of need of a need to 
have some sort of idea of what's going to happen

01:28.321 --> 01:41.942
particularly with regard to our utilities and our 
transportation system and it's it's so obvious

01:28.321 --> 01:41.942
that

01:28.321 --> 01:41.942
we're not getting the resistance to be used to to 
that kind of

01:46.141 --> 01:49.505
give you a better, even a better perspective of how 
we manage our planning. And it's still true today

01:49.646 --> 02:03.984
that we use the tool of a transportation plan to 
push most of our programs through, or at least get

01:49.646 --> 02:03.984
some sort of commitment from our city council, 
whether it be an ordinance or a resolution. But you

02:04.485 --> 02:13.296
have to understand that the transportation 
planning division of the planning department has

02:04.485 --> 02:13.296
grown to encompass an area-wide transportation 
planning designation by the governor. And if

02:18.839 --> 02:22.986
you're a transportation planner, you'll 
understand that it means the Metropolitan

02:18.839 --> 02:22.986
Planning Organization. That designation 
entails certain responsibilities to carry out

02:24.568 --> 02:38.288
transportation plans for all the local 
governments contained within our urbanized

02:24.568 --> 02:38.288
area, which is the city of Portland, the city of 
Corpus Christi, the county of San Patricio, and

02:24.568 --> 02:38.288
Nueces County. In order to maintain that 
designation and eligibility to continue

02:39.702 --> 02:52.816
receiving transportation funds, we have to 
annually update our transportation plan and take

02:39.702 --> 02:52.816
it back before a policy advisory group, which 
consists of elected officials, to approve. That

02:54.217 --> 02:56.920
in itself entails a commitment to do certain 
things. And because the Metropolitan Planning

02:58.061 --> 03:08.072
Organization, which I'm in charge of, includes 
other governments, It leaves our own

03:09.976 --> 03:21.250
administration no choice but to follow for the 
most part my recommendations on moving forward

03:09.976 --> 03:21.250
with approval of some kind of planning document. 
And we have in my transportation program that I put

03:21.591 --> 03:31.984
together, I'm talking about the planning program 
that I put together, I always include two major

03:21.591 --> 03:31.984
elements and those elements have to do with the 
other elements of a transportation plan, of a

03:32.302 --> 03:51.846
comprehensive plan, socioeconomic work, land 
use, utilities, et cetera, because

03:32.302 --> 03:51.846
transportation plans are not effective unless 
they're developed and consistent with the other

03:32.302 --> 03:51.846
planning elements and that realization. In 
addition, the fact that because money is becoming

03:52.847 --> 04:01.397
so short, scarce, I should say, the utilization of 
that money in the most efficient manner It's

04:01.782 --> 04:07.711
extremely critical to continue to allow this city 
to grow in an orderly fashion. And I believe people

04:09.313 --> 04:20.830
have come to realize that an understanding what's 
going to happen five years from now, ten years from

04:09.313 --> 04:20.830
now, is necessary in order to allocate those funds 
for those kinds of improvements. A major street

04:21.551 --> 04:29.983
that we want to put in, which is the extension, 
major highways, extension of a freeway facility,

04:21.551 --> 04:29.983
once it begins from the planning stage, until its 
final construction could take as much as 20 years.

04:35.904 --> 04:39.830
And unfortunately, what happens there in the 
interim could be disastrous. But until we move

04:39.991 --> 04:45.920
now, we know that that facility, the sooner we 
start, the better off we are. The same is true for

04:46.240 --> 04:53.912
understanding what our growth patterns are and 
what our sewer needs are going to be, our drainage

04:46.240 --> 04:53.912
needs are going to be, our water needs are going to 
be. We've got to start now to start putting these

04:54.297 --> 04:56.739
things to the ground. I think the management has a 
realization that information is very critical.

05:01.844 --> 05:23.443
And I think that we'll see eventually not only what 
I consider a sort of an unofficial approval of what

05:01.844 --> 05:23.443
we're doing as far as long-range or as 
comprehensive planning or development

05:01.844 --> 05:23.443
planning, but we may ultimately even see an 
official approval of some sort of comprehensive

05:23.913 --> 05:30.122
document, which has taken us so many years to move 
towards that. And I've been here 10 years.

05:34.688 --> 05:37.833
What I tried to move you through was the, is that 
recording right now? What I tried to move you

05:38.133 --> 05:53.515
through, I tried to pick you up and give you an idea 
of how, from the management point of view, they

05:38.133 --> 05:53.515
perceived what a comprehensive plan was and how 
we've had to deal with it, basically, The zoning

05:53.950 --> 06:10.173
ordinance was looked upon as our plan, and 
comprehensive plans were really good for looking

05:53.950 --> 06:10.173
at and dreaming about and nothing that they could 
actually, that the council or the city management

05:53.950 --> 06:10.173
wanted to work with. From that point of view to 
where we're beginning to transition to a wider

06:10.694 --> 06:22.371
acceptance of the need for long-range planning, 
if we have to change the name of it, to something

06:22.638 --> 06:27.123
that's more acceptable, we'll do that as long as 
the end results are the same. It really doesn't

06:27.403 --> 06:28.525
matter to me. This also reinforces the fact that 
changes, particularly if they're going to be

06:29.466 --> 06:43.602
good, in my opinion, have to occur slowly, 
particularly in this community. This city has

06:43.802 --> 06:47.626
been very anti-change for the most part. And now, 
over the last three years, it's extremely

06:47.706 --> 06:52.071
pro-development. And I think that new concept of 
progress is having influences working its way

06:52.473 --> 07:07.186
back into our own work programs, our own efforts. 
One of the things we anticipate is an accelerated

07:08.448 --> 07:16.915
growth across this area. We think that the city of 
Houston, which we have lost so many people to, that

07:22.105 --> 07:27.830
it's going to be maxing itself out as far as growth 
is concerned in the next four to five years. And

07:28.490 --> 07:33.135
that Corpus is sort of like a sleeping bear getting 
ready to awake. And it does have a lot of potential

07:33.235 --> 07:44.845
for handling

07:33.235 --> 07:44.845
major growth, both in all areas of the city. It's a 
very long city. And of course, in fact, we have a

07:46.146 --> 07:51.150
very aggressive annexation policy recently, 
although Corpus Christi also includes all the Bay

07:51.417 --> 08:04.822
Area, and we just recently annexed a major portion 
of the island, and I think we intend to move forward

07:51.417 --> 08:04.822
and annex the rest of the Bay Area island up to the 
city limits of Port Aransas. And not in the

08:05.984 --> 08:07.707
northwest part of town. We're seeing a tremendous 
amount of growth there. We might end up being the

08:10.793 --> 08:13.999
longest city in the state of Texas where it's 
going. Michael,

08:15.481 --> 08:35.481
I want to thank you for your valuable insights and 
for relating your experiences and your knowledge

08:15.481 --> 08:35.481
of the funding program here in Corpus and also some 
very interesting notes on Jonathan Cunningham

08:15.481 --> 08:35.481
and his operations in El Paso through the years. 
The procedure now is that this will be taken back to

08:36.153 --> 08:48.007
Texas A&M, and we will have it transcribed in rough 
draft form by the people at Archives. And then this

08:48.027 --> 08:51.711
will be mailed back to you for your review and 
comment. I may go through it initially and make

08:51.812 --> 09:00.822
some obvious red line marks on it for grammar and 
whatnot, or repetitions. And then I'll send it

09:01.623 --> 09:05.788
down to you for your markup.

09:06.713 --> 09:13.062
simulate additions or deletions depending upon 
how you look at it at that time. And then it'll be

09:13.302 --> 09:16.667
final typed after that. And I also want to thank you 
for your offer, very generous offer of

09:16.687 --> 09:26.160
stenographic work for final typing. We may very 
well be able to accept that. Well, we should be able

09:30.827 --> 09:36.214
to do some of it for you, at least different 
sections, anything to keep the project moving. I

09:36.734 --> 09:38.800
appreciate the opportunity of being able to speak 
with you. And I think it's a valuable document

09:38.820 --> 09:49.509
that's going to really serve a great purpose as far 
as bringing people up to date to where planning has

09:38.820 --> 09:49.509
been and where it's going in the state of Texas. 
Thank you.
