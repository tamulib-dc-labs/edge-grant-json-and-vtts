00:05.920 --> 00:11.529
If you're just sitting on the sidelines taking it 
easy, then I'm not going to deal with you. The most

00:12.250 --> 00:21.625
perilous thing in the world is to be the point man, 
because you don't know whether what you're doing

00:12.250 --> 00:21.625
is right or wrong. You can only be guided by your 
conscience, your intelligence, and what you feel

00:21.645 --> 00:25.752
is right. But because you are doing something, 
because there are dynamics there, you're going to

00:26.390 --> 00:31.156
make mistakes. Screwing up should never be a 
reason to fire somebody. Somebody screws up is

00:35.942 --> 00:38.025
because they're doing something. The guy who 
never does anything wrong is probably not doing

00:38.085 --> 00:41.169
anything. So people who tell me that the 
government should be doing this, the

00:42.070 --> 00:49.039
government's had 10 years to do it. A million times 
zero is still zero. That's exactly what the

00:52.624 --> 00:54.766
government's got. We need dynamics. We need a 
change. And I think that the only way to get the

00:57.929 --> 01:08.000
issue resolved is to provide a catalyst that will 
break the diplomatic logjam. They're trying to do

01:08.020 --> 01:11.584
something that's impossible right now. They've 
come to loggerheads with the communists for all

01:12.806 --> 01:16.950
the reasons I've already said. There needs to be a 
catalyst there. I intend to provide that

01:19.528 --> 01:21.931
catalyst. And then I'm going to get out of it. I tell 
the government every time I talk to them, I don't

01:23.653 --> 01:28.038
like doing your job for you. I'm not being paid for 
it. If you'll just start doing it, I'll be glad to

01:29.659 --> 01:33.484
get out of it, and I know you'll be glad to have me 
out. But throughout American history, any time

01:34.405 --> 01:42.654
that there has been a vacuum of government, it's 
been filled by private citizenry. An example? not

01:45.668 --> 02:08.250
directly related but partially related is the 
watergate the executive branch would not examine

01:45.668 --> 02:08.250
itself so what happened the legislative branch 
filled that vacuum and required the executive

01:45.668 --> 02:08.250
branch to police itself back in king george's time 
there was a vacuum of government a few men who were

01:45.668 --> 02:08.250
determined to see right and justice done had guts 
enough to sign the Declaration of Independence. I

02:13.356 --> 02:14.518
don't know who'd sign it today. Everybody wants 
some damn lawyer. You know, it's okay if you want to

02:16.640 --> 02:18.783
check with King George. So I hope that in the 
history of the United States from this day

02:19.944 --> 02:32.398
forward, any time there is a dearth of government 
action that some, that's what we're about, is

02:19.944 --> 02:32.398
freedom. is some individual will find courage 
enough to withstand the slings and arrows of

02:32.935 --> 02:43.527
criticism that will be hurled at him, because 
that's exactly what happens. The first thing that

02:44.088 --> 02:47.352
they do, go back through history and do some 
homework. Anytime someone has tried to go against

02:48.012 --> 02:55.421
the status quo, the first thing they do is try to 
discredit him. Failing that, then they'll begin

02:55.441 --> 02:59.185
to marshal all of the bureaucracy. No man has been 
successful standing against the bureaucracy i

03:01.876 --> 03:30.297
don't know whether i will be or not and when i say 
that i have to caveat it because you see

03:01.876 --> 03:30.297
who is our consumer advocate

03:01.876 --> 03:30.297
yeah nadir but he wasn't fighting the u.s 
bureaucracy he was fighting general motors at

03:01.876 --> 03:30.297
that time martin luther king was successful but uh 
jesus christ was successful Look what they tried

03:30.513 --> 03:31.614
to do to him. They nailed him to the cross. 
Everybody said he was a nut. Anytime. You know, you

03:36.221 --> 03:39.926
go back through history, it doesn't mean that they 
were wrong. It means they happened for a short time

03:39.946 --> 03:44.212
to be a majority of one. As long as you're dealing 
with truth and reality, those two things can

03:44.232 --> 03:49.278
withstand the test of time. So I know I'm on perfect 
ground. One, I have the secret to life. I earned it

03:53.684 --> 03:57.209
through learning about death. I earned it up on 
that mountain where I got some truths. I know about

04:01.293 --> 04:02.194
life. I'm fearless right now because I don't have 
to worry. I know what comes next. I know that I'm

04:07.379 --> 04:09.821
right because what I'm dealing with is truth. I 
wouldn't be doing if I didn't know it wasn't true.

04:12.204 --> 04:19.731
So in the end, I know all the critics, just like the 
critics of the Washington Post when they started

04:12.204 --> 04:19.731
talking about Watergate. I know what the result's 
going to be. All I got to do is stand back and just

04:22.254 --> 04:24.336
watch it happen. And so that's why I don't get 
concerned about critics. Can you explain how

04:29.288 --> 04:32.851
Velvet Hammer came about and why did it fail? Yes. 
Velvet Hammer didn't fail. It never got out of the

04:36.454 --> 04:40.958
jungles of Florida. But it came about because, 
again, I was asked to retire, and I did in 1979. By

04:47.043 --> 04:52.829
1980, we had developed information that included 
satellite photos of American prison camp in Laos.

04:53.829 --> 04:56.412
We went to Florida to train to rescue those 
prisoners. President Reagan won the election. He

04:58.432 --> 05:07.360
was briefed on the situation, and like Admiral 
Tuttle told me, he was the man Jerry Tuttle was

04:58.432 --> 05:07.360
responsible for this mission in the Pentagon out 
of DIA then. He said, quote, the president's

05:07.901 --> 05:10.043
excited about this. We're going to make the rescue 
using federal troops. We don't need you no more,

05:12.825 --> 05:13.826
Bo. You can go home. I knew it wasn't ever going to 
happen, and so I begged him. He said, Bo, I got them

05:19.571 --> 05:22.454
by the balls on this thing. They can't turn it 
around. We're going to rescue those prisoners. So

05:26.377 --> 05:28.219
I disbanded the troops in Florida. We went home 
Easter in 1981. The raid never came off. When

05:33.132 --> 05:50.595
Admiral Tuttle called me May 21, 1981, at my home in 
Los Angeles, he said, Beau, tomorrow the

05:33.132 --> 05:50.595
Washington Post is going to break a story that says 
that the CIA sent Lao mercenaries looking for

05:51.014 --> 05:52.756
prisoners and found none. And I said, Admiral, are 
you telling me that they've turned the planes

05:52.776 --> 05:55.800
around? Because I use the analogy of the Bay of 
Pigs, and he says, yes, it's off. So then that's

06:00.727 --> 06:02.850
what happened with Velvet Hammer. What about 
Grand Eagle? Grand Eagle was a product of the ISA.

06:07.496 --> 06:09.619
ISA, Carter did one thing. As far as I know, that was 
good. He created, in the wake of the Iranian

06:13.384 --> 06:16.228
debacle, a special intelligence organization 
that Congress didn't know about called ISA. Its

06:22.043 --> 06:29.793
purpose was to rescue and do special missions that 
was outside the congressional oversight. And

06:30.113 --> 06:33.157
oversight's a damn good word to use with respect to 
Congress. But if you wanted to do a clandestine

06:33.878 --> 06:38.183
operation, you had to go through seven 
subcommittees of Congress. Some of them are pink

06:38.500 --> 06:41.423
old commie faggots. We know that because we have 
films of them committing fellatio with people in

06:41.964 --> 06:47.931
the Longworth building in the men's room. They're 
all kind of fruits and nuts in Congress. So it is

06:52.096 --> 06:59.284
insane to think you can conduct clandestine 
operations by getting Congress approval. So ISA

06:59.304 --> 07:05.531
was created specifically to work for the 
president to do this kind of thing.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.393
Theoretically, it was wonderful. But in reality, 
it had no fangs because as soon as Velvet Hammer

07:08.116 --> 07:16.467
went down, ISA told me, Bo, we've picked this thing 
up now. We're going to do it. And that was Grand

07:17.849 --> 07:18.870
Eagle. It never got across the creek. I was 
supposed to have gone across the Mekong River to

07:21.373 --> 07:27.701
document Americans in captivity and bring one 
back if possible. It never got off of the drawing

07:27.721 --> 07:32.427
boards because DIA challenged ISA. 
Theoretically, ISA should have prevailed. But in

07:36.567 --> 07:52.487
reality, because bureaucratically it was safer 
to keep the POW issue in the filing cabinets of the

07:36.567 --> 07:52.487
Pentagon, because if I'd have gone across the 
creek, there's a goddamn good chance that they

07:36.567 --> 07:52.487
would have had to dealt with something in three 
dimension instead of two-dimensional

07:36.567 --> 07:52.487
paperwork. So ISA failed. As a result, ISA became 
exposed. And there was a big article in the paper

08:00.157 --> 08:05.123
about how the president was just now but too late, 
beginning to get a handle on some of the secret

08:05.693 --> 08:14.769
intelligence activities that were going on.

08:14.789 --> 08:16.151
So that's what happened with Grand Eagle. It 
wasn't very grand because it never got out of the

08:16.231 --> 08:22.482
United States, and it certainly wasn't an eagle. I 
called it Boheka, which meant bend over, here it

08:23.785 --> 08:27.932
comes again. That's exactly what it turned out to 
be. What do you think were the political reasons

08:31.107 --> 08:39.339
for Kissinger's refusal to accept the list of POWs 
from the Cambodian? Good reasons. Good,

08:40.341 --> 08:43.005
perfectly wonderful political reasons. One, his 
marching orders were to get out expeditiously

08:43.666 --> 08:48.233
with honor. If he would have dealt with a Lao, it 
would have opened up a whole new dimension to the

08:48.774 --> 08:55.123
war because we had forever denied that we were in 
there. My helicopters used to be shot down over

08:56.065 --> 09:03.754
there, and every time they were, I used to have to 
say when we couldn't recover them that I was off

08:56.065 --> 09:03.754
course, that I didn't know where I was. That's 
crap. We were conducting the war in Laos for good

09:06.177 --> 09:09.020
reason, because that's where the enemy was. But if 
Kissinger would have accepted the POW list, he

09:09.080 --> 09:17.230
would have had to have opened up that whole new 
arena. It would have lengthened the time that we

09:17.767 --> 09:21.091
could have gotten out with honor. It would have 
meant reparations for the Laos because we had

09:21.112 --> 09:27.280
destroyed property, resources, and people. And 
we would have had to have dealt with that. And it

09:29.743 --> 09:31.706
would have meant a larger economic package. It 
would have meant negotiations. It would have

09:33.068 --> 09:37.834
meant exposure because American activists would 
have said, what do you mean Laos? What are we doing

09:38.395 --> 09:40.618
fighting the war in Laos? We never heard about 
that. And so for those reasons, And I fault him for

09:45.965 --> 09:54.135
this because if Kissinger would have been a good 
human being, he would have weighed his conscience

09:45.965 --> 09:54.135
against the good of the nation. And you see, in the 
end, maybe in the short run, the good of the nation

09:54.155 --> 09:59.841
was to say, go away, Laos, we're not going to talk to 
you. But damn it, in the long run, what is this

10:00.562 --> 10:05.548
country about if it's not about the humans that 
make it up? So when he let those brave soldiers drop

10:06.689 --> 10:12.616
between the cracks, he wasn't right. Even though 
He was following his boss's orders, which was get

10:14.804 --> 10:20.311
out with honor now. So for political expediency, 
he signed those men's death warrants in many

10:20.331 --> 10:28.841
cases. Have any of them been recovered? No. The Lao 
have never turned over a prisoner of war. Do we have

10:37.973 --> 10:41.998
proof that there actually are some prison awards 
that are aligned in Los Angeles? What about the

10:42.018 --> 10:43.660
satellite photograph? The only reason the 
satellite picture was taken was because the

10:43.680 --> 10:52.771
patrol said, hey, we saw 30 Americans precisely 
here at Namarat. And then the satellite was

10:52.791 --> 10:56.656
positioned, and bingo, there's Fort Apache. 
That's what Chairman Dornan called it because he

10:56.676 --> 10:59.880
got privileged all the information. In addition, 
there are the hundreds of refugee reports. The

11:05.184 --> 11:08.791
evidence is as clear as a nose on our face. If we will 
open our political eyes, we will see that in

11:08.952 --> 11:13.701
others.

11:15.250 --> 11:24.419
The best analogy I can give is Denison Lane, 
spokesman for the Pentagon, said this about

11:15.250 --> 11:24.419
yellow rain. With so many people saying it's so, it 
must be so. And everybody believed that. There

11:30.004 --> 11:33.187
were only about 10 people talking about yellow 
rain in those days. I used Denison Lane's words.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.773
With so many people saying it's so, it must be so. 
Because there have been almost 3,000 reports from

11:42.571 --> 11:46.697
natives of Southeast Asia talking about 
Americans in captivity. 670, more than,

11:46.717 --> 11:58.215
firsthand eyewitness reports, satellite 
photographs, intelligence chiefs that say, yes,

11:46.717 --> 11:58.215
with all that I know, I must say that we left those 
prisoners behind. Silver stars given out for

11:59.257 --> 12:02.141
people that were left behind. There's

12:02.161 --> 12:07.009
no question about it. Not because I say so. The Laos 
say, we're not saying we don't have the prisoners

12:09.412 --> 12:12.215
of war. We're saying Laos is a big country, very 
poor. You help us, we'll go look. The Vietnamese

12:16.779 --> 12:18.801
don't say they don't have prisoners of war. They 
say that they are holding American criminals,

12:18.982 --> 12:27.610
common criminals, but that they have no right to be 
identified because we have no diplomatic

12:18.982 --> 12:27.610
relationship with them. The president says it's 
top national priority, but yet A deputy assistant

12:32.133 --> 12:40.623
secretary is the highest-ranking U.S. official 
to ever go to Vietnam and talk about this since

12:32.133 --> 12:40.623
Henry Kissinger left 10 years ago. So if that's the 
kind of top national priority it is, I think it's

12:41.624 --> 12:45.308
bullshit. And that's why I'm willing to act as a 
vigilante if I have to, even though I don't

12:45.869 --> 12:52.256
advocate vigilantism in this country. Why do you 
think those countries are still holding the POWs

12:52.276 --> 12:54.519
there? I mean, what benefit do they have? They 
represent billions of dollars in economic aid.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.803
And because they're humanitarian. If they 
weren't humanitarian, they would have killed

13:04.306 --> 13:09.736
them a long time ago when it became obvious the 
United States wasn't going to pay off. But you see,

13:10.256 --> 13:13.863
in the beginning, the Vietnamese thought they 
were going to negotiate with Henry Kissinger. And

13:15.085 --> 13:18.812
they said, here's our parcel of POWs. We were going 
to, over five years, give them $3.5 billion. And

13:23.568 --> 13:28.015
they were going to continue to give us POWs in that 
exchange. We didn't give them a dime because even

13:28.656 --> 13:34.125
though Nixon signed the agreement, Congress 
didn't ratify it. So we tricked them. Ha-ha, we

13:35.346 --> 13:42.037
tricked ourselves because they had planned on 
parceling out POWs in return for that economic

13:35.346 --> 13:42.037
aid. Secondly, Nixon said, if you violate the 
Paris Peace Accord, I'm going to start bombing

13:42.578 --> 13:47.145
Hanoi again. So Hanoi had good reason to hold those 
prisoners as an umbrella of security. Nixon got

13:51.642 --> 13:53.184
washed away at Watergate. As a result, Ford had no 
fangs. There was no threat. What do you do with

13:57.170 --> 13:58.472
those POWs? Thirdly, there was a POW who, like 
Jimmy Ray, because he violated certain laws that

13:58.992 --> 14:09.508
they had, they said, we are changing your category 
from prisoner of war to common criminal. You will

14:09.528 --> 14:10.489
never go home. So for those good reasons, and like 
the Lao, if you were a Lao villager, and a fighter

14:16.150 --> 14:37.770
bomber were to come over and drop bombs and some of 
those bombs killed your villagers destroyed your

14:16.150 --> 14:37.770
homes and resources and that fighter bomber were 
to crash and you were to capture the pilot what

14:16.150 --> 14:37.770
would you think of him would you think that he was a 
war hero to be treated with respect as the red baron

14:16.150 --> 14:37.770
might have created one of our aces no you are a 
criminal You're going to be held as a criminal

14:38.324 --> 14:43.111
because you've taken our lives, you've destroyed 
our property and our resources. And we're going to

14:43.451 --> 14:47.997
hold you in prison because you're not even at war 
with this country. And until we recognize the fact

14:48.017 --> 15:01.356
that there are as many bomb holes as in Laos as there 
is in Vietnam and deal with the truth as it is real,

14:48.017 --> 15:01.356
those guys, the Lao, have every reason to hold them 
as Americans. And so that's some of the reasons why

15:01.376 --> 15:04.500
they've kept them. and why they're still keeping 
them. One, what do you do with them? Go out and shoot

15:07.906 --> 15:09.149
them all? They are not that kind of a people. 
Secondly, they still represent the potential for

15:11.032 --> 15:18.225
whatever 1983 dollars would be. It was 3.5 in 1973. 
But a lot of that stuff has escalated 10 times. And

15:27.588 --> 15:33.034
some of it's only escalated half, maybe, in the 
inflation of 73 and 83. But certainly it

15:33.775 --> 15:36.258
represents probably $10 billion today. How are we 
going to drive that kind of a budget wedge into an

15:37.319 --> 15:42.104
already strained economy? So you understand why 
the president has a problem with that. he's hoping

15:46.786 --> 15:54.216
that somebody like me will go over there and bring 
one back so that on human rights basis we can get

15:46.786 --> 15:54.216
them back for nothing. Because if he has to drive 
that $10 billion wedge, it has to go to all the

15:54.236 --> 16:01.266
unpopularity of opening up the wound of war. What 
politician is going to survive that? It's an

16:04.170 --> 16:05.772
unpopular cause. It's going to bring great 
scrutiny down on him. If you were a political

16:08.876 --> 16:12.942
advisor, you'd probably tell the president to 
stay away from it. So for all those reasons, you

16:12.962 --> 16:16.607
would be right, but you would be wrong. for the deep 
reason that it is not right. Morally, we're

16:20.124 --> 16:26.732
obligated to bring those lives home because 
they're American citizens and they have a right to

16:27.134 --> 16:29.698
life as we know it in this country. And the worst 
thing that can happen to a warrior is to die alone in

16:30.759 --> 16:34.425
the hands of his enemies. And that's what's going 
to happen to those guys. It's happening even

16:36.748 --> 16:37.750
today. Give me some information about your 
current new operation, Lazarus, and what

16:39.532 --> 16:46.182
direction do you think it's going to take? Well, 
Lazarus is finished. Lazarus was in three phases.

16:50.428 --> 16:51.690
It began in September. of 1982 when we went to 
Thailand to solidify intelligence. That was

16:56.687 --> 16:57.609
phase one. Phase two is when we crossed into Laos 
twice to evaluate guerrilla organizations who

16:58.431 --> 17:07.654
purportedly could do the job, but I hadn't seen it 
proven on the ground. Phase three was called

17:08.073 --> 17:12.520
Lazarus Omega where we were going to make the 
rescue. We were betrayed and all that resulted

17:12.881 --> 17:16.767
since then. There is a new operation we are calling 
it Phoenix because from those ashes we are going to

17:17.648 --> 17:29.727
rise stronger and hopefully invincible this time 
to finish the job. Phoenix is prepared. We are

17:33.670 --> 17:34.391
waiting. We have one more step. Nothing else 
remains to be done. Everything is set. The last

17:40.219 --> 17:44.745
step I will make will be to bring the prisoner home. 
And the mechanism is set, and we're just simply

17:45.606 --> 17:53.537
waiting for it to work. What time frame are we 
looking at? Well, I'm not going to be specific for

17:56.833 --> 18:04.965
intelligence reasons, but it's difficult to move 
during the monsoon season. The rain makes

18:05.826 --> 18:09.711
movement, food, communications. It degrades 
everything. Last year we launched in November

18:13.356 --> 18:17.702
because that's when the rain stops.

18:20.686 --> 18:24.815
Okay, and my last question is, what is it in you? You 
sort of answered it before, but I want to hear more

18:25.717 --> 18:28.363
specifically. What is it in you that keeps you 
searching for these aliens? Just because I know

18:32.813 --> 18:39.808
they're there, I know they're alive, and who else 
is going to do it if I don't? Admiral Inman of the CIA

18:41.341 --> 18:50.358
said, Bo, if I were to tell you that the CIA will do 
everything we possibly can to get these Americans

18:41.341 --> 18:50.358
home, will you stop? I said, no, sir, because I know 
he's full of crap. They are politically

18:57.232 --> 18:58.494
controlled. They're not only going to do in their 
bureaucracy. Who are they? They are little

19:01.861 --> 19:04.125
bureaucrats in a building at Langley. They need 
someone who has been across the river, who has been

19:05.017 --> 19:09.925
there to see it. Martin Luther King said, I've been 
to the mountains. Damn it, I've been across the

19:12.770 --> 19:14.893
Mekong. I know that they're there. I know the CIA. I 
know the DIA. I know the President of the United

19:19.280 --> 19:24.689
States doesn't really know what they're talking 
about when he says we're doing all possible. What

19:25.130 --> 19:27.734
does that mean, all possible? If it's top national 
priority, why don't we fly the POW flag every day?

19:32.303 --> 19:37.630
If it's top national priority, why isn't the vice 
president over talking to the Vietnamese right

19:32.303 --> 19:37.630
now? So I know they're full of crap. Those are sweet 
words like check is in the mail and a lot of other

19:38.911 --> 19:43.397
things. And sweet words aren't going to get those 
Americans home. It's going to take direct action,

19:47.662 --> 19:52.508
straight line type action. And it takes intensive 
action. You can't just do it on a part-time basis.

19:57.380 --> 19:59.902
Put it in my inbox, I'll get to it later. It has to be 
worked 24 hours a day because it is one hell of a

20:00.143 --> 20:04.927
project. This nation has not rescued American 
prisoners of war since January 1945. We failed at

20:12.235 --> 20:20.343
Sante, we failed at Mayaguez, we failed in Iran, 
and we sure didn't succeed in the Bay of Pigs. We

20:21.604 --> 20:23.946
traded some of our prisoners back for tractors. 
That's a measure of success. So we haven't done

20:26.793 --> 20:29.500
anything right in this country since World War II. 
And the reason, as I think, because we have been

20:30.884 --> 20:35.436
working on a double standard. The U.S. government 
looks at what is best for the nation, and it

20:35.456 --> 20:43.317
quantifies it with respect to economics and 
politics. but yet the soldier is expected to

20:43.837 --> 20:52.726
perform based on what's good for the nation, duty, 
honor, country, and not what is in his own best

20:43.837 --> 20:52.726
interest. What if the soldier, when asked to go to 
Latin America, said, well, let me see, is it in my

20:52.746 --> 20:57.191
best personal interest? I'm getting paid $550. I 
may get my ass shot off. It isn't. I'm not going.

21:03.598 --> 21:06.000
Well, that's exactly what the nation is doing. 
It's saying, how much is it going to cost us? How

21:08.883 --> 21:10.144
many votes is this going to be? Politically, how 
sensitive is this? It's not worth it. We won't do

21:13.127 --> 21:13.708
it. So if the individual reacted the way the 
nation's reacting, we'd give a war and nobody

21:14.583 --> 21:19.689
would go. And maybe that'd be the right thing to do. 
I don't know. The nation is our mother. The

21:26.416 --> 21:27.377
government is our mother. Nobody likes to hear 
their mother called a whore, even if it's the

21:27.537 --> 21:30.480
truth. I want the government to look good. 
Unfortunately, it is tough to get them to commit

21:42.477 --> 21:49.823
And I have told them, I'm going to give you all the 
discredit you deserve if you don't help us in this

21:42.477 --> 21:49.823
endeavor. Because it's very dangerous. I'm going 
to be really angry if something happens to me or

21:52.185 --> 22:01.073
that American PW and we're coming back across the 
river this time because the bureaucracy didn't

21:52.185 --> 22:01.073
want to get involved. And I intend to jam it right 
down their throat. I don't like the idea. And in the

22:05.837 --> 22:09.200
end, I may renege and let them say it was all their 
idea. I don't know. Time will tell that. But I'm

22:13.207 --> 22:18.576
doing it because if I don't, who will? And there are 
a lot of critics, but not very many people willing

22:18.596 --> 22:25.167
to get into the arena.

22:25.187 --> 22:26.009
Okay. Thank you. All right. I appreciate it.
