00:04.621 --> 00:17.035
This is an interview with Dr. Burke Rambo by Scott 
Hill on November the 25th of 1988 at his home

00:04.621 --> 00:17.035
concerning the Vietnam War. In the interest of 
accumulating knowledge about the war, I'm going

00:17.055 --> 00:25.004
to donate this tape to the Texas A&M oral history 
collection in the university archives. Is this

00:25.024 --> 00:26.445
all right with you? Yes. OK. First thing I want to 
start with is just general information of your

00:27.547 --> 00:34.054
date of birth, place of birth, And your education? 
Date of birth, 30 April 1943, San Francisco.

00:40.938 --> 00:44.703
Education, doctorate. In what area did you? It's 
in social studies. OK. And you're currently

00:49.189 --> 00:51.672
employed at Blinn? Currently employed at Blinn as 
an adjunct instructor.

00:59.242 --> 01:00.624
Your current military status? Commissioned 
officer, not active.

01:07.987 --> 01:12.574
What, uh, why did you join the military services 
and when? Could you give us a little background

01:12.594 --> 01:15.259
about that? First time I went in the military was 
1963. It was a reserve program. From there back to

01:21.469 --> 01:23.973
college in ROTC. Followed commission in May 66. 
Later to Vietnam. Okay. I was commissioned in May

01:34.075 --> 01:35.537
of 66. You went in the ROTC program at what 
university? ROTC unit, Sam Houston State

01:39.141 --> 01:41.584
Teachers College. Was it called Teachers 
College? I went there for a year. Commonly called

01:48.393 --> 01:53.559
Bearcat High.

01:54.200 --> 02:00.167
What was your specialty or your job description

01:54.200 --> 02:00.167
in the military? First job description would be 
9,300, which was the old designation, the combat

02:01.362 --> 02:13.197
intel, commissioned military intelligence. 
Before MI was a branch, it was the army security and

02:14.318 --> 02:20.806
army intelligence. It was AS and AI. And I worked in 
the intelligence side.

02:30.944 --> 02:36.449
At what point in your career did you receive orders 
to go to Vietnam? Received orders to go to Vietnam

02:36.469 --> 02:43.316
upon completion of infantry, or school after 
infantry basic. What year was that? In 67. In 67 and

02:46.599 --> 02:49.321
arrived in Vietnam June 67. Did you request to be 
that assignment? We had a choice, a partial choice

02:56.488 --> 02:59.871
between Vietnam and Korea. And if you were going to 
do anything, you went to Vietnam. Why did you? Why

03:07.314 --> 03:09.697
did you need to go to Vietnam if you were going to do 
anything? What do you mean? I think if you have a war

03:12.559 --> 03:15.322
going, declare it undeclared. And you want you 
want a commission, you want to serve. I think you

03:20.807 --> 03:23.129
should go. It's not a matter of saying I had to go or I 
was told to go.

03:31.846 --> 03:42.640
I think it's the difference between waiting 
around for the draft notice and then running down

03:31.846 --> 03:42.640
and enlisting five minutes ahead of the postman. 
For an officer, if there's a war, then, you know,

03:42.660 --> 03:48.708
the experiences where you stay in is going to be 
what you use later anyway. At that time, did you

03:50.270 --> 03:53.133
have designs on being a career military? 
Considered it, and it'd be very...

03:58.863 --> 04:02.708
It was one of the options, enjoy teaching or 
instruction type. However, I won't say I didn't

04:03.649 --> 04:05.972
enjoy what I did.

04:10.638 --> 04:12.801
You get a lot smarter after you're in a while. Did 
that

04:13.943 --> 04:25.958
aspirations of possibly being career military 
influence your decision on career or Vietnam? I

04:25.978 --> 04:28.802
think the biggest thing on that area would be the 
Uncle in World War II, he'd been an infantry

04:29.795 --> 04:35.060
officer and well-decorated. Attitude was, if 
you're not infantry, you're nothing. It's like

04:41.746 --> 04:43.868
being the quarterback of the football team. It's 
the desire of nearly everybody that plays

04:43.888 --> 04:48.732
football would like to be, gosh, I want to be the 
quarterback. Well, be the infantry lieutenant.

04:51.695 --> 04:57.079
The guy that runs the battlefield.

04:57.099 --> 04:58.941
And you arrived in... June 67. Arrived, I think, 8 
June 67. Where were you stationed? Went from,

05:05.819 --> 05:17.035
entered in Saigon, entered through Benoit, 
Tonsenute Air Base, went north to what was called

05:05.819 --> 05:17.035
Task Force Oregon. And at the time, it was a 
classified project. They wouldn't tell you

05:21.762 --> 05:27.670
anything in country before you left, except to say 
it was upcountry, meaning north. Oh, I see. So

05:29.667 --> 05:38.076
did they prepare you in any way for the Vietnam 
cultural experience? Or did you just shift over

05:39.477 --> 05:44.182
there, kind of cold turkey, knowing what to 
expect? I won't say cold turkey, but I'm not sure

05:44.863 --> 05:51.430
anybody ever knows what to expect. And you can see 
all the news tape you want. It's like viewing the

05:54.292 --> 05:56.755
news tape of a garbage dump. Until you go to the 
dump, you don't want to get the smell of the tape.

06:02.387 --> 06:10.597
You know, the analogy today would be you can watch 
all the war shows you want, but the sensory part

06:02.387 --> 06:10.597
that's missing is your nose. You know, you can sit 
in the theater and see the big screen and, you know,

06:12.399 --> 06:17.245
kick it, but you don't have the smell. When they 
burn the barrel, you see a burning barrel, unless

06:18.206 --> 06:25.375
you've put your nose over a burning barrel 
downwind from one, you say, goodness. You then

06:26.136 --> 06:27.838
know what the smell is. No, I don't think the army 
and not to default to anything there. They had a job

06:33.570 --> 06:34.971
getting people there. The, uh, the ability, I 
guess, to adopt what we probably gambled, you

06:36.313 --> 06:47.527
could take an American, he can do anything. I think 
we may have overstated it, but, uh, as far as the

06:55.308 --> 06:59.273
normal procedures to see what went on there before 
you got there. There wasn't a big push on it. It was

07:03.698 --> 07:06.541
just get in there, you know, you're there, go. What 
were your first impressions when you first got

07:06.741 --> 07:13.269
there? Smell. The door of the plane opens, you know 
you're not at home.

07:21.258 --> 07:24.201
The heat felt no different than Texas in 
summertime.

07:26.510 --> 07:29.213
We describe the sound as far as language or 
anything goes. Hitting your ears immediately

07:29.253 --> 07:37.543
would be a sing-song, musical sounds, a different 
set of background noises. Even with city traffic,

07:38.104 --> 07:44.432
there's still this, there's a strain, and of 
course your nose picks up the smell immediately.

07:49.017 --> 07:55.605
Normally here, we don't ride locked inside of 
buses with cyclone fence over the windows, with

07:49.017 --> 07:55.605
armed guards front and rear. You

07:57.644 --> 08:04.216
know, it was kind of like walk down, go buy a 
customs. Customs check was a joke. If you wanted to

08:07.963 --> 08:10.749
take anything with you, you know, take it. If you 
didn't, don't. And kind of walked by and said, you

08:15.257 --> 08:17.662
got anything to declare? And that was kind of the 
end. It's sort of like crossing the border of

08:18.383 --> 08:20.968
Mexico today, unless the dogs. You mean you had a 
customs check upon arrival? Upon arrival, we went

08:25.064 --> 08:26.786
through Vietnamese. Technically, we were 
guests. We went through Vietnamese customs,

08:29.610 --> 08:40.784
which meant you walked down the ramp of the plane, 
walked by a customs officer who may have asked one

08:29.610 --> 08:40.784
or two people a dumb question, and the other 165 of 
you shuffled by. In real life, no check.

08:46.912 --> 08:48.694
What were they expecting you to say? I'm not sure 
what they expected, what they were looking for and

08:49.653 --> 08:53.779
didn't get an answer. If you had one, you didn't 
tell them. They were looking for anybody carrying

08:55.902 --> 08:58.025
private weapons. In other words, non-standard 
issue stuff, and they kind of asked the question

08:59.426 --> 09:05.695
over and over, does anybody, and of course 
whoever, if anybody had one, they said no. So it was

09:08.379 --> 09:10.902
saying, you know, just keep walking. Unload the 
plane, get the plane empty. The plane leaves, you

09:14.006 --> 09:17.331
file out, get on the buses. We'll haul you from 
point A to point B, start processing.

09:25.700 --> 09:30.086
So was it a very big culture shock for you? Culture 
shock question, no. I think being raised in rural

09:32.270 --> 09:48.313
areas, seeing rural poverty, and seeing places in 
Mississippi in the 60s, in the early 60s, late 50s,

09:32.270 --> 09:48.313
that aspect's not a culture shock.

09:51.837 --> 10:01.169
Probably said by a lot of people there that we met, 
that if the Vietnamese would talk to you, they

09:51.837 --> 10:01.169
weren't the best citizens in their community, the 
polite ones. The good ones seemed to put the

10:02.230 --> 10:06.896
parasol between you and them and kept walking. But 
as far as a terrible cultural shock, no. You just

10:12.984 --> 10:15.828
saw poverty on a magnified level. See kids playing 
in garbage. see people picking through it, but a

10:20.609 --> 10:29.137
great shot to know.

10:29.157 --> 10:32.140
Where were you assigned? I went to Task Force 
Oregon, which is at Chu Lai I-Corps, about 55 miles

10:32.160 --> 10:41.749
south of Da Nang.

10:44.552 --> 10:46.774
OK. On the East Coast? Yeah, it was on the ocean, on 
the ocean side. Batangan Peninsula, which is

10:51.608 --> 10:55.534
south of there.

11:00.661 --> 11:08.493
When you got there, can you describe what you went 
through, how you were processed? Overnight plane

11:08.513 --> 11:15.363
ride, plenty of bull and chatter on a noisy C-130, 
which are uninsulated. Arriving at a replacement

11:15.403 --> 11:20.991
point in the night, told, make yourself 
comfortable. The roads are closed. We'll be down

11:27.356 --> 11:30.419
to get, you know, they come down in the morning to 
pick you up. First light, you see the mine sweeping

11:30.960 --> 11:35.765
team coming down the road, walking ahead of the 
trucks to pick you up. And basically, it looks like

11:37.627 --> 11:49.780
any processing done in any military anywhere in 
the world, after they get you in, get the orders

11:37.627 --> 11:49.780
out, it was officers one way and enlisted the other 
way. Hurry up and wait. Stand in line. We'll hurry

11:53.556 --> 12:03.064
you over there on a jet, fly you up country on a 
propeller plane, and stand you in a tin building

11:53.556 --> 12:03.064
and let you wait. What

12:03.085 --> 12:18.157
I kind of wanted to get was just a brief idea of what 
exactly you did, what was your function. I

12:18.177 --> 12:20.239
processed in and was assigned to the Task Force 
Oregon, which later became Americal Division, to

12:21.046 --> 12:27.034
the Division Intelligence Unit. And one of the 
first functions I would take would be to work in the

12:29.297 --> 12:34.243
order of battle shop. This area coordinated, 
collected agent reports, the paper trail

12:35.004 --> 12:49.062
information on the other side, coordinated it 
Issued new reports, summaries of the unit

12:51.117 --> 12:54.582
strengths, the enemy side. Worked with our side, 
the G3.

13:00.030 --> 13:06.839
And trying to develop the intelligence we needed 
for the commander to go out and shoot the bad guys

13:00.030 --> 13:06.839
and do whatever he wanted to. Provide him a 
service.

13:11.406 --> 13:13.229
You read thousands of pages of reports. Sifted the 
bull, which was most of it. I guess they saw a good

13:19.585 --> 13:22.168
thing coming when they saw us. If you had some trash 
to sell, don't steal. Sell it to the Americans as an

13:26.512 --> 13:28.334
agent report. Tell them there's somebody in the 
woods. They'll buy it. Somebody will buy it from

13:30.736 --> 13:34.300
you. And basically, the job there was for quite a 
while was building up this database. The Task

13:41.187 --> 13:46.072
Force Oregon crew had been there about 90 days. The 
Army had relieved the Marine Corps. And they were

13:49.943 --> 13:53.627
still settling in a division. And it was process 
your data. And some of it was electronic,

13:58.954 --> 14:08.485
non-electronic, aerial surveillance, the 
pictures, the agent reports, sightings from your

13:58.954 --> 14:08.485
troops. And what you're amounted to was a big 
sifter in a cookie factory. Can you make sense out

14:11.348 --> 14:14.452
of all the stuff coming in? What do you do with it? 
And that would be the normal That'd be the normal

14:20.369 --> 14:21.450
day. You get up, you go to work, you shuffle 
mountains of paper. You try to reduce it down to a

14:24.434 --> 14:30.421
two-page, three-page, four-page report, 
depending on what the bosses wanted.

14:33.745 --> 14:36.728
And that would be the overriding day in, day out. 
You also, if you could, got out. Can you find

14:40.452 --> 14:43.076
anything to do outside base camp wire? And... 
Probably one thing to be said when you go to town

14:46.306 --> 14:55.775
outside any of the gates in Vietnam, after a while, 
all the towns look alike.

14:57.316 --> 15:02.741
Street full of beggar kids wearing shirts three 
times their size. Actually, the shirt may be the

15:02.841 --> 15:04.883
only clothing they had on. It may not be. Usually 
short pants. Always wanting to wash your Jeep for

15:09.527 --> 15:14.592
money, guard your Jeep for money, clean your 
rifle. A lot of the children could take your rifle

15:15.736 --> 15:19.260
apart faster than the average American soldier. 
They could clean them, put them back together, and

15:20.121 --> 15:22.464
hand them back to you. I think the, this part of 
seeing this many orphans, uh, war created, uh,

15:24.527 --> 15:32.376
other problems. I think that was where a lot of 
people weren't even looking at your own ghettos.

15:38.263 --> 15:40.466
Your ghettos were, were good.

15:43.209 --> 15:43.870
The, uh, Life in the camp was, you stayed behind the 
wire. We had Vietnamese that worked on the

15:49.046 --> 15:51.790
compound. The area I worked in was a restricted 
area. We kept everybody out. You processed your

16:00.944 --> 16:02.186
paper. You would see the commanding general. We 
had a crew, and I worked with him, posting his maps

16:04.349 --> 16:07.013
at night. Learned a lot of strange things in the 
Army. When the general comes in, you leave his

16:10.358 --> 16:13.162
office, except we made a trade. We didn't. They had 
to be posted. They wore a game. They pulled the

16:17.661 --> 16:19.683
stickers off the maps. What you really did in the 
order of battle area is you sorted out the

16:19.703 --> 16:35.300
multitude of units that you were facing and tried 
to find where were they hiding, where are their

16:19.703 --> 16:35.300
headquarters, what are their intentions from 
captured documents. The IPW prisoner of war

16:35.360 --> 16:42.588
compound provided you the reports. The national 
police provided them. Other agencies, what we had

16:46.000 --> 16:48.983
to do was kind of coordinate the flow. That was the 
actual two's job. Our boss was to supply the

16:53.087 --> 16:56.170
commander with the needed data. Then he broke the 
job down, and you got whatever task came up inside

16:56.190 --> 17:00.454
of this. You may do a project. You may end up writing 
a book. In other words, 30, 40, 50 days on a project.

17:08.281 --> 17:09.582
I may want a two-page paper. It's 10 o'clock now. I 
want it at 1 o'clock. Go look in your file, what have

17:13.743 --> 17:15.285
you got? Your best guess if you got nothing. And you 
do this kind of shuffling. Were you involved in

17:23.834 --> 17:25.876
gathering intelligence? I worked some in 
collection, mostly that later, but some in Chulai

17:26.837 --> 17:41.573
going out and running low-level agent nets, 
talking to people, picking up data, mainly going

17:26.837 --> 17:41.573
downtown, collecting information. working 
somebody else's net they set up. You simply went

17:44.857 --> 17:51.626
in, if you want to look at it, picked up the paper and 
came back to town.

17:53.849 --> 17:59.276
Most of it was kind of the security side in a way, 
looking at it. We worried about how much could they

18:00.397 --> 18:03.962
get from looking at what you were doing. And we 
provided the other side, our soldiers did, a lot of

18:05.724 --> 18:10.851
information that was useful. You could tell if a 
big operation was coming because simply just go

18:12.063 --> 18:15.107
down. Everybody asked for the laundry back a 
couple days early. Or I won't see you on Thursday. I

18:20.813 --> 18:22.315
won't be here on Thursday. You count the 
helicopters. If a helicopter's going out, it's

18:26.139 --> 18:29.483
hauling people. There's a limit. You just count 
them and keep counting, and then you know how many

18:30.665 --> 18:33.608
helicopters. You said you provided the other side 
with information? Yeah, all your troops do. If you

18:39.295 --> 18:41.277
go downtown to the village and you talk, They have 
their agents in the town. We had our agents. Both

18:45.885 --> 18:47.227
sides ran agent nets.

18:50.191 --> 18:51.914
Both sides had tax collectors. The South 
Vietnamese government would come in and collect

18:51.954 --> 18:54.658
money. During the daytime, the communist 
government would come in at night, or the shadow

18:56.461 --> 19:05.394
government, whatever you want to call it, would 
come in and tax the people. We'd come back the next

19:05.414 --> 19:09.440
day, fine you with a tax receipt, and take the tax 
receipt away from you. It was illegal. Now you're

19:10.872 --> 19:14.838
out your services or you're out your rights, and we 
took the receipt. So even if they win, they don't

19:15.819 --> 19:17.582
pay you. You have no record. You know, drafting in 
Vietnam was fascinating to watch. South

19:26.054 --> 19:33.124
Vietnamese government surrounds a village, goes 
in and picks out all the young military-age males

19:26.054 --> 19:33.124
and loads them on the truck. That's how you visit 
your local recruiter. He comes to your door.

19:38.712 --> 19:39.293
That, uh... Mostly, at least during the initial 
few months, it was working in the office,

19:40.775 --> 20:08.537
shuffling papers, visiting outlying camps and 
fire bases, finding out what they've got going on,

19:40.775 --> 20:08.537
going on patrol, whatever the commander wanted, 
whatever your boss wanted you to do or whatever you

19:40.775 --> 20:08.537
could go do, that it was kind of up to you to get out 
and hustle if you wanted to do something. And I

20:09.563 --> 20:14.608
think part of it was wanting to get away from the 
flagpole, get away from headquarters. I'm here,

20:15.429 --> 20:16.931
send me to the woods. I'm here, let me go to the 
woods. There was a joke used to tell in Vietnam, if

20:19.153 --> 20:23.337
you messed up in the base camp, they sent you to the 
woods. If you messed up in the woods, they sent you

20:24.138 --> 20:26.421
to the base camp. And depending on where you were 
standing and what you wanted to do, mess up. You get

20:33.027 --> 20:34.149
a change of scenery. You foul up here, we ship you 
out. You foul up out there, they ship you back. So

20:39.955 --> 20:42.819
when you couldn't stand what you were doing, you 
asked for a transfer. How did the military train

20:45.041 --> 20:47.825
you for the function? Was it in the States? Yeah, 
when I left Fort Benning, went to Fort Holabird in

20:49.267 --> 21:00.500
Baltimore, Maryland, received the initial 
intelligence training. And the Army cut short the

21:02.683 --> 21:09.051
training program and had a levy need, which is a 
requirement for 400 officers in Vietnam, 400

21:10.921 --> 21:19.194
intelligence officers. So you go through the 
school, a very quick one. You come out the other

21:25.383 --> 21:32.133
side wearing the brass that says you are now an 
intelligence lieutenant. Even if you can't spell

21:32.153 --> 21:34.116
it, you are one. Steal the Marine line. And on to 
Vietnam. give you 30 days leave, and send you over.

21:49.044 --> 21:51.688
Did you feel like you were adequately prepared? 
Oh, I don't think any lieutenant would ever have

21:51.708 --> 21:56.635
all the training you want. I think you always want 
more, but so what? You got about the same amount the

22:00.940 --> 22:02.883
other guy got. The infantry officer going to 
Vietnam is from ROTC. Got nine weeks at Fort

22:09.477 --> 22:10.979
Benning. I did the nine weeks at Benning, then went 
on to Fort Hollabird, did their training cycle,

22:13.101 --> 22:21.269
and shipped to Vietnam. So you were in training 
longer than the infantry lieutenant who got

22:21.289 --> 22:25.013
there. In other words, we had people who left nine 
weeks after arriving in mid-January straight to

22:25.033 --> 22:32.040
Vietnam. We went to another school, and we caught 
up with them in June. They're already there.

22:36.619 --> 22:38.000
They've been there a couple of months. What 
happened to you guys? We went to intelligence

22:39.621 --> 22:43.825
school.

22:43.845 --> 22:53.453
They had a requirement at that era that all 
intelligence officers had to be trained in one of

22:43.845 --> 22:53.453
the combat arms, infantry, artillery, or armor. 
And due to my uncle's persuasiveness, I chose

22:53.473 --> 22:56.716
infantry.

22:59.538 --> 23:05.303
That

22:59.538 --> 23:05.303
may not be all it was put up to be,

23:08.489 --> 23:11.113
You know, it's like wanting a quarterback in the 
Super Bowl. Every kid did to play football.

23:17.462 --> 23:22.950
So you were there right before Ted, around Ted. Did 
you notice an increase in information or

23:22.970 --> 23:28.619
intelligence? Did you have any inkling through 
the intelligence that you gathered that

23:28.679 --> 23:36.450
something like that was about to happen? We had 
reports. But the problem with reports is you

23:40.383 --> 23:45.971
always have reports one side saying it's going to 
happen. Pick a date, any date you want in Vietnam,

23:45.991 --> 23:49.636
and you could have an attack on it. And you had a 
report that said it's going to happen. It's how

23:52.940 --> 23:54.242
true is the source. There were clues. And we had 
captured, which we learned later, prior to Tet,

23:57.226 --> 24:07.420
the Tet documents for I-Corps. United States 
Marine Patrol went out, picked him up, came back,

24:08.868 --> 24:16.358
and did not process their documents.

24:19.282 --> 24:23.869
That always looking back, it's easy to pick out, 
yeah, here's the report. I absolutely knew this

24:23.929 --> 24:25.691
guy was right. Looking at it at the moment, you 
always expect You can be shelled anytime, whether

24:31.025 --> 24:37.693
it's going to be well-organized, high level, and 
happen like it turned out to be is another guess.

24:37.873 --> 24:47.485
Probably the answer is, in the place I worked, 
sure, there was a guess that everybody wanted to

24:37.873 --> 24:47.485
bet on one side, put your money on, Ted's going to be 
exciting. The optimist said, quit worrying. The

24:52.491 --> 24:54.433
pessimist won the argument in this case. But we 
didn't have... Copies, and by the way, their

24:59.611 --> 25:04.578
copies that they wrote never did exactly name your 
place. They always used code names for their

25:04.598 --> 25:06.541
targets. So even if you had one, you knew it was 
going to happen sometime because they wrote these

25:07.262 --> 25:10.987
orders.

25:14.512 --> 25:15.754
It's how you interpret it. Looking backwards, 
yeah, we saw a lot of things. We didn't read the

25:19.179 --> 25:21.963
signals. Did you find that a lot of the 
intelligence that you gathered and passed on was

25:21.983 --> 25:27.851
not active on? Oh. First off, you get it that you 
pass it and the boss does what he wants with it. You

25:35.265 --> 25:37.949
may never know first if it's acted on or not. You 
hand your report out, they send it down to the

25:37.969 --> 25:48.443
field, somebody in the field does something, you 
don't know if they moved on that report, another

25:37.969 --> 25:48.443
report, a guy steps in a hole and breaks his leg and 
finds a tunnel. It's how do you find it. Most

25:51.928 --> 25:54.171
intelligence reports if you want to consider them 
one sheet of paper, are never acted on. In other

25:58.120 --> 26:04.428
words, you may spend six months piecing together a 
picture that's fuzzy, then go sell the commander,

25:58.120 --> 26:04.428
let's act on it. And you go out there and then 
nothing happens. And you know what the commander

26:07.732 --> 26:09.314
says after that? Don't bother me. What are you guys 
doing back here? You know, what's going on behind

26:13.960 --> 26:17.124
the building with the shut doors and the shame 
drawn? Not work, I know. We went out and looked and

26:18.605 --> 26:20.648
didn't find anything. And you may have 8, 10, 12, 20 
dry runs for every time you hit something. The

26:26.984 --> 26:40.041
problem was that if the troops in the field, and by 
the way, the troops in the field at least

26:26.984 --> 26:40.041
traditionally and a good bit of experience in 
Vietnam suggest, see things, they had to be taught

26:26.984 --> 26:40.041
to turn it in.

26:42.985 --> 26:47.651
Teaching troops to turn it in is never simple. 
Teaching a guy not to take the enemy soldier's

26:47.671 --> 26:51.917
wallet is never simple. Not only when he gets the 
wallet with the money in it or the picture in it and

26:53.568 --> 27:02.496
says, I got one off a dead guy, he also destroyed any 
intelligence information if he keeps the paper.

27:02.516 --> 27:05.259
Throws the papers away, we can never find which 
body they came from. You know, we created

27:06.720 --> 27:09.002
problems. But you always hoped your intelligence 
is better. You'd love to fall into the road map, get

27:14.107 --> 27:19.352
the whole plan of the entire war laid out for you and 
have the document. Normally what you get... It's

27:22.002 --> 27:27.770
like looking through a telescope without having a 
map. You've got hundreds of pictures of whatever

27:27.790 --> 27:30.413
you're looking at. What is it? And to make fun of 
intelligence might be to talk about from the old,

27:33.477 --> 27:38.925
the six men of Endistan. They were all blind. They 
went out to see what an elephant looked like. One

27:43.771 --> 27:45.273
walks under it, there's nothing there. It's like 
the air. One grabbed his tail. It's like a rope. One

27:49.459 --> 27:50.380
grabbed his trunk. One grabbed his leg. describe 
what you grabbed each one of them described an

27:52.917 --> 28:22.924
elephant they were all right as far as it went and 
that's the thing with intelligence it first has to

27:52.917 --> 28:22.924
be timely it has to be accurate and if you're going 
to make a living out of this and stay there you've

27:52.917 --> 28:22.924
got to be believable to the boss and that's the hard 
part what are you guys selling today we went you

27:52.917 --> 28:22.924
know last month last year last time out we found 
nothing now what makes this report better than the

27:52.917 --> 28:22.924
other one And it's not like going out and selling 
cars. In fact, a lot of times in Vietnam, we

28:30.733 --> 28:33.816
couldn't tell them all we found. We could give you a 
hint. Do this, do something. In fact, we had a

28:42.003 --> 28:49.609
problem policy that changed before it was over was 
we had several times we knew attacks would occur

28:42.003 --> 28:49.609
and we didn't tell units. Why was that? The source 
of the information was worth more than the unit.

29:03.546 --> 29:07.850
What's the sense of having the information? If you 
have a source and the other side figures out the

29:08.611 --> 29:16.740
only source you have, it's a unique, critical 
side. If they know where the leak is, they can plug

29:17.160 --> 29:20.163
it any time they want. Instead of tipping it off for 
five men, I want to save it for something

29:23.165 --> 29:27.611
worthwhile because they'll know how we did it 
eventually. You know, it's like playing poker.

29:34.321 --> 29:36.645
You may throw in a few cards and fold. You may want to 
play the whole hand. If you play the whole hand and

29:37.927 --> 29:46.539
there was only one way they could have said this and 
they discover they've got a security problem,

29:37.927 --> 29:46.539
they'll fix it. So you better play it when it's 
important. You just don't play it for them just to

29:50.705 --> 29:52.648
do it. You

29:55.143 --> 30:06.038
did that all the way till June of 68? I worked in the 
order of battle six, seven months and crossed out

30:06.178 --> 30:19.357
with the IPW, the interrogation section. 
Eventually I ended up in the interrogation

30:20.498 --> 30:23.142
section. doing interrogations and processing 
captured documents, between doing whatever, the

30:23.594 --> 30:41.300
patrolling, the women on long range,

30:23.594 --> 30:41.300
the visitation to the SF camps, the out of compound 
work. Went back in the compound division where I

30:42.122 --> 30:47.149
either performed documents or interrogations. 
So you went into the field? You went to the field,

30:50.534 --> 30:53.078
but you didn't stay. Other words, I would be sent 
out with a sergeant, with two sergeants, with

30:54.003 --> 31:02.214
whatever the boss, however many interrogation 
teams you need. Get a team out, you do your job,

31:03.536 --> 31:07.922
you're assigned to some task force, you're 
attached. As soon as the operation's over, you

31:08.583 --> 31:12.628
come home, the unit goes back to their base camp. 
Next time out, whoever's on rotation goes out, or

31:12.648 --> 31:17.054
as required. Look, what exactly can you describe 
exactly like a typical operation? Typical

31:24.496 --> 31:27.059
operation probably would go out and join the 
infantry. And if someone jokingly said about it,

31:29.142 --> 31:35.370
walk through miles and miles and nowhere, fly you 
out, dump you off, and walk. And most of the time,

31:37.853 --> 31:40.376
you did not get prisoners.

31:44.381 --> 31:45.423
If you got them, they were wounded. If they were 
wounded, they were put on a helicopter and flown to

31:45.463 --> 31:48.867
the rear if they were severely wounded. If you got 
one in the field that wasn't wounded severely, you

31:50.787 --> 31:58.580
had the problem of however you want to sort out, is 
he lying and telling the truth? If I'm holding a gun

31:58.620 --> 32:03.990
upside your head or whoever's holding it, 
bringing you into me when they turn you over to me.

32:06.053 --> 32:12.845
If I ask you a question, if you ask it the wrong way, 
you're going to always answer the question,

32:06.053 --> 32:12.845
trying to figure out what the guy wants to hear. 
Unless you want to die right there. And then you go

32:18.648 --> 32:22.292
out and you try to check the story the guy's giving 
you, and there's nothing to it. So then you ship him

32:23.274 --> 32:24.835
on back as a prisoner. Actually, what we had, what 
we held them was the Vietnamese government ran the

32:25.997 --> 32:32.685
only prison camps. We ran detention collection 
points. We would hold them, process them, decide

32:36.810 --> 32:40.835
were they innocent civilians. If so, turn them 
loose. If not, then we forward them to the next

32:42.697 --> 32:47.963
level, the Vietnamese government. which ran 
their prisoner of war camps.

32:55.303 --> 33:01.871
The field interrogations were usually at a low 
level, no great sophistication. Where'd you come

33:02.952 --> 33:03.753
from? Where you going? What's your unit doing? How 
many of them? What are you doing out here? You know,

33:09.039 --> 33:12.884
you get dumb answers, and this is where you may find 
cultures different. It may pay you to sit and ask

33:14.346 --> 33:17.089
them, how's your grandfather? Have you had a 
letter from home lately? No. We approach it one

33:21.467 --> 33:22.909
direction. The Vietnamese approach the 
answering the questions the other way. And if you

33:27.995 --> 33:32.219
had the time and wanted one of them to tell you what 
he was doing, you gave him a notebook if he could

33:27.995 --> 33:32.219
read and write. And you told him to write out 
everything he'd ever done in the Army,

33:32.540 --> 33:35.423
self-critique. And the little guy sits down and 
starts writing and writes you mountains of it.

33:40.108 --> 33:42.691
Describe all the stuff you've ever done since the 
day you joined the Army. And he starts. Oh, you

33:43.812 --> 33:44.253
won't. It's the last page. What was he doing? just 
before the two of y'all's armies bumped into each

33:47.242 --> 33:50.807
other. I don't want to know who his cook was, but I'm 
saying we want to know what's he doing, but to get

33:51.889 --> 34:01.662
him there, you may have to let him do all his talking 
and go the other way. Because of the cultural

34:02.123 --> 34:04.146
difference? Their way of doing business, the 
communist system, that and culture. You tried to

34:09.173 --> 34:12.878
take advantage of early on interrogations. You 
tried to find out religions. whatever,

34:16.503 --> 34:20.488
take advantage of it. Take advantage of the lack of 
it. If what you had to do was find something that

34:24.214 --> 34:31.764
made the other guy uncomfortable, can I get there? 
Can I get him to talk? By the way, the ultimate loss

34:35.109 --> 34:39.034
is if you beat him until he talks.

34:41.562 --> 34:51.373
You go anywhere you want to with that report, but 9 
out of 10, although the odds may be even higher, it

34:41.562 --> 34:51.373
won't be true because I'm going to tell you 
anything to get you to stop. So what you wanted was

34:51.393 --> 34:55.518
you wanted him to quote unquote willingly tell 
you. The only problem you had was, Lieutenant, we

34:57.360 --> 35:01.144
want the report on our desk in an hour. So that gives 
you 30 minutes to shake on him, 30 minutes to write

35:02.446 --> 35:08.953
the report, and just hope he had something to say. 
No, sir, he didn't know a thing. All he did was carry

35:12.203 --> 35:13.705
rice. All he did was dig ditches for them. The 
thousand and one things that both armies do, you

35:18.871 --> 35:26.879
caught people from stupid to brilliant. And it's 
sort of like saying, what do you expect the average

35:26.899 --> 35:39.733
Vietnamese soldier who infiltrated from up 
north, who had walked down south, it may have taken

35:26.899 --> 35:39.733
him two months to get there, He's been there a 
couple months, hiding in the woods, coming closer

35:40.405 --> 35:45.733
and closer to your camp. Your unit goes out, 
surprise him, and you catch him, and you ask him

35:45.793 --> 35:54.727
where he is, and he has no idea because he can't read 
a map.

35:54.747 --> 35:55.988
He was just sent to do a job. And they can usually 
name the officer above them, the unit they're in.

36:02.959 --> 36:05.322
They have a lot of nicknames, code names for their 
units. He had a thing called a letterbox number,

36:05.703 --> 36:09.028
which would be like our zip code. So he could have a 
letter written to him. But a lot of times they

36:13.434 --> 36:15.537
didn't know a lot of things. But it's these small 
pieces, five words here, ten words there, a

36:15.557 --> 36:19.544
sentence or two here. Once in a while you hit, it's 
like digging for diamonds. Once in a while you find

36:23.911 --> 36:29.681
one, most of the time you're in the hog pen when 
you're through digging. There's not a hit. So you

36:30.760 --> 36:35.626
had, did you know any Vietnamese, or did you have a 
South Vietnamese? We used interpreters to start

36:35.646 --> 36:37.888
with. We found a lot of, some of the prisoners you 
encountered spoke English, some spoke French.

36:43.675 --> 36:47.840
Gradually you could learn, or you did learn to do it 
orally as far as reading and writing. It took more

36:47.860 --> 36:49.222
time. Worked on some, did not go to a school. It was 
haphazard. You learned the military terminology

36:54.428 --> 36:59.974
you needed, but you couldn't order dinner in a good 
restaurant.

37:02.975 --> 37:14.411
So,

37:02.975 --> 37:14.411
typical field operation would just go up trying to 
flush the quail. Yeah, you went on walks in the, and

37:14.431 --> 37:19.377
made fun of it, walks in the woods, shake down rice 
paddies. There's a report, which you may or may not

37:19.397 --> 37:23.703
have furnished them, but there's something going 
on in the area. The commander says, check it out.

37:25.926 --> 37:27.749
You may send 150 guys. You may send 500. You may send 
1,000, the battalion, depending on what's going

37:29.151 --> 37:32.475
on. And usually, you tagged along with the lead 
element of the company right behind it, or

37:33.434 --> 37:39.200
whatever it was near the front. So if something 
happened, they had one of you worthless intel

37:39.740 --> 37:44.465
types up there. And I'm over and over, what do you 
guys do? Well, we talk to prisoners, but you've got

37:49.229 --> 37:51.511
to catch them first. You bring me one. You bring the 
guy in, and no documents on him. His wallet's

37:58.138 --> 37:59.079
missing. He swears it was stolen. No papers. You 
simply hurt yourselves and what you had to do. A lot

38:06.357 --> 38:12.785
of the time we spent nearly as much time in the field 
educating the troops, trying to talk to them. But,

38:12.805 --> 38:27.022
you know, if you think of the problem you're 
facing, here it is, you and the other guy have just

38:12.805 --> 38:27.022
shot each other, your friends have been shot, you 
remind them of all the things that's happened in

38:12.805 --> 38:27.022
the past, and now I want you to turn loose to this one 
guy everybody's getting ready to beat up on and

38:12.805 --> 38:27.022
give him to me. Are you kidding? We're not through. 
It's like a football game. No, no, not until after

38:29.985 --> 38:32.128
we pile on. If you kill him, you kill your friends. 
It's the best way to describe it to anybody. Every

38:39.527 --> 38:46.218
time you killed one without getting anything from 
him, you just didn't bring him in. And by the way,

38:46.318 --> 38:52.027
there's not a big neon sign on the battlefield that 
says take prisoners. There's a requirement if you

38:52.047 --> 38:54.510
do get them that you treat them right. However, the 
difference between being a dead, attempted

38:56.193 --> 38:59.398
surrender And a prisoner is, you run through a 
hedgerow carrying a stick. It looks like a rifle.

39:04.225 --> 39:05.065
We shoot and kill you. But once the fighting's 
over, we've got you. We're not supposed to kill

39:08.109 --> 39:11.812
you. It was convincing guys that their units had 
been mauled on. Some of their buddies had been

39:15.496 --> 39:17.999
killed, not cleanly either. Give me a prisoner. 
You caught the guy. Here's the report you wrote in

39:23.224 --> 39:25.727
the field, or you just brought him to me. You've 
tagged him. Here's where we caught him. We caught

39:27.669 --> 39:28.930
him with a rifle. What are you guys going to do? 
We're going to talk to them. Talk. I want more than

39:32.397 --> 39:34.940
talk. That's what we're trying to do, fellas, is 
get some answers to where they are, what they're

39:34.960 --> 39:39.747
doing, so we can get more of them. When you don't 
bring them to us, we can't do anything. You're

39:43.112 --> 39:44.694
along then as an observer. What you can see and make 
your best guess, add up all the strange facts in the

39:44.735 --> 39:50.743
field, you've got that. Other than that, you're 
out. You're no better than the next guy.

39:57.433 --> 39:59.035
We try to be more organized about it. That's what 
the whole business of the branch was. Sometimes it

40:02.590 --> 40:04.773
works, sometimes it doesn't. There were 
commanders in Vietnam who didn't care about

40:04.793 --> 40:08.457
intelligence. They didn't believe in it. First, 
you got 99 bad reports. Can't you fools sort out

40:15.465 --> 40:18.328
which one of these is true? Yes and no. We believe. 
It's sort of like playing poker at the table, and

40:22.943 --> 40:29.993
you ask me, what are the other five poker players 
holding in their hand? If I've seen all the

40:31.135 --> 40:38.406
discards, they were face up, they drew their card 
face up, I have a clue on how they're betting if I'm a

40:31.135 --> 40:38.406
good player. But if you played all seven cards 
down, and you ask what are they holding, I can only

40:39.748 --> 40:48.681
look at the three they've played, the four they've 
played, the five, and make a guess. Other words,

40:49.673 --> 40:54.058
what we tried to do was guess what their commander 
was going to do. Do you think that the hostilities

40:56.481 --> 41:11.719
that the soldiers felt towards these prisoners 
was typical of Vietnam, or typical of any war, or

40:56.481 --> 41:11.719
just unique of the Vietnam situation? Oh, I think 
that any time any two armies are out there killing

41:11.739 --> 41:19.208
each other, that You have a problem because the 
first problem is you're supposed to hate the other

41:20.167 --> 41:27.080
side's government, not the other side's soldier 
necessarily. He's a professional, too. The

41:30.907 --> 41:35.235
problem was keeping that attitude in mind doesn't 
do a lot to motivate you to take the hill. It's like

41:36.938 --> 41:40.304
the old first sergeant said, if you kill enough of 
them, he'll come along and take the names. If he's

41:40.324 --> 41:42.428
too busy, never mind, we'll just skip 
name-taking. You know, we got a job. Well, it's how

41:45.383 --> 41:53.230
you keep, and the strange thing is, it's how you 
keep your emotions under control. You're doing a

41:53.310 --> 41:54.652
job out there. The moment you forget what your job 
is, and by the way, any lieutenant's job wasn't to

41:55.753 --> 42:01.078
fire a weapon. The job's traffic cop. You direct 
people. When you had to start shooting, you lost

42:05.842 --> 42:10.947
control because you're now playing the part of a 
rifleman, a private. Somebody's got to run the

42:11.450 --> 42:16.980
unit or nobody, and it may be nobody sometimes. And 
that's one of the problems we had. I think it takes a

42:18.743 --> 42:21.288
few battles. It's just like playing football, but 
where do you practice war scrimmages? We have

42:29.202 --> 42:30.824
training exercises. These are supposed to 
simulate war. Nothing, no training table can ever

42:32.346 --> 42:45.042
simulate war because if you go to Benning or any of 
the places and you make a mistake, the land grader

42:32.346 --> 42:45.042
stops and says, Lieutenant, that's not the school 
solution.

42:47.705 --> 42:50.209
That's good as far as it goes. However, on the 
battlefield, there's not going to be any land

42:51.070 --> 42:57.758
grader or any referee or any zebra to replay the 
hands you're dealt. It's when the two of you units

43:00.031 --> 43:04.575
or armies bump into each other, both of you play 
what you hold. The guy that plays it best wins.

43:09.660 --> 43:14.105
There are stupid, dumb things the American army 
walked into in Vietnam. There were stupid traps we

43:14.125 --> 43:18.689
set up that any American would have seen it, but 
they weren't Americans. They came walking down

43:18.990 --> 43:21.392
the trail and walked right into your hands. You 
think of this. You go out and dig foxholes and lay in

43:23.314 --> 43:26.277
the woods and set an ambush. You stay quiet and let 
the other unit walk up 20 yards from you, 25 yards,

43:26.628 --> 43:37.965
and then holler surprise, whatever you want to 
holler.

43:40.269 --> 43:42.512
Battles do strange things to people. Some of them 
don't fire their rifles. Probably in Vietnam, one

43:45.076 --> 43:49.864
in five, one in six, and a lot of them didn't shoot. 
The other problem is you get some guys you can't

43:50.084 --> 43:52.508
stop. You put a leash on them, it's an Exxon Tiger in 
your tank thing. Your job as a lieutenant is direct

43:55.619 --> 43:59.383
traffic. If you're an infantry lieutenant, you 
have four squad leaders and a platoon sergeant,

43:59.403 --> 44:05.249
five people you're responsible for. Everybody's 
responsible for four or five others. Everybody's

44:08.933 --> 44:10.875
got to make sure the job's done. When you have 
problems, it's when you go out there and nobody

44:10.915 --> 44:16.280
does that job, the chain of command breaks down. 
Then you get into the, we've got a problem, sir. And

44:21.505 --> 44:22.426
what do we do about it? Well, that's when it 
becomes... Gosh, I wasn't there either type

44:25.572 --> 44:28.537
answer. Nobody was there. If it goes wrong, try to 
find anyone who wants to stand up and say, yeah,

44:29.458 --> 44:34.025
yeah, we did that. If it went right, everybody 
wants to be dead center in the picture saying, see

44:34.346 --> 44:40.916
what I did, Mom. Nobody would take 
responsibility. Nobody wants to blame.

44:45.823 --> 44:46.845
Everybody wants the credit. If it was a million 
dollars, it would be giving away everybody's kin

44:48.427 --> 44:52.133
to you. And if you owe a bill, try to catch one.

44:58.242 --> 45:06.994
So I just think you're, how successful do you feel 
like, or is there any measure of success for you?

45:08.316 --> 45:09.838
Yeah, there's measures of success. I think if you 
go out and you see that you've converted even a few

45:09.898 --> 45:22.596
of these guys, the riflemen, to collect the data, 
to leave the documents on the body until you can get

45:09.898 --> 45:22.596
there. To show you the stuff, you know, we had 
training programs. We'd go out and say, if you see

45:29.109 --> 45:36.960
any of these things, the old Army show-and-tell 
program, show them a picture of all this trash the

45:29.109 --> 45:36.960
enemy has, all their stuff. If you see any of it, 
don't touch it, don't move it, come get us. We've

45:41.847 --> 45:45.132
got the people that need to look at it exactly as it 
is. Don't tear it up. Don't bring it to us because

45:46.233 --> 45:51.180
you've destroyed a lot of it. Yeah, there were 
successes. There were also failures. It was just

45:54.976 --> 45:56.178
like any program. It was always ongoing. The thing 
I think that made Vietnam tough, every 12 months,

45:57.320 --> 46:03.230
everybody in the unit left and went home. What we 
had in Vietnam, probably the nice about it, was

46:03.250 --> 46:17.254
21-year lesson plans, which always learned the 
same thing no matter which year you learned them

46:03.250 --> 46:17.254
in. And reading the files afterwards tended to 
suggest that we always learned the same thing, how

46:18.567 --> 46:24.874
to tie your shoes.

46:28.077 --> 46:30.240
You didn't learn what you needed. You were always 
learning basics, never mind getting on to the

46:31.041 --> 46:37.548
advanced things. Oh, the chance they were new. 
Some of them were old guys, some of them were new

46:38.549 --> 46:44.135
guys, and there was no old guy, new guy loyalty. It 
was your old friends, basically. And unit

46:48.503 --> 46:59.755
cohesiveness, and I think the thing, looking 
back, that the Army's even learned is you don't

46:48.503 --> 46:59.755
send people as individual replacements to wars. 
You send units. We've gone back to what the British

47:01.637 --> 47:05.601
had, the old British Army Regiment. The American 
Army's called it the cohort. We've gone back to

47:07.523 --> 47:13.549
this group that's going to go to school together, 
train together, fight together, and be replaced

47:07.523 --> 47:13.549
together. It's not we're going to shuffle you out 
on a pass Graduation came 365 days a year in

47:16.955 --> 47:22.620
Vietnam. Your year's up, pack it.

47:27.024 --> 47:31.429
And you went out one time with four people who'd 
been there a year. You were the rookie. Next time

47:32.770 --> 47:34.792
you went in the woods, you'd been there six months. 
You had one old man with you and two rookies. The

47:36.934 --> 47:38.695
last time you go out, you're the old man. They're 
the rookies. There was never any of this. We worked

47:44.020 --> 47:45.882
together, trained together,
