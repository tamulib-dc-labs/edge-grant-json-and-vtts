WEBVTT

00:03.389 --> 00:14.665
So he called up some of his buddies at Pomona and at Claremont, and he told them what he had done.

00:14.705 --> 00:17.529
And they said, well, let's all go together.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.333
And by that time, they knew my work.

00:20.433 --> 00:24.539
And there was a diplomatic historian there and a Russian historian there.

00:24.879 --> 00:28.364
And they both thought very highly of my work.

00:28.384 --> 00:32.029
And so they said, well, we'll all go together.

00:32.009 --> 00:38.143
I went in a body with these very fine gentlemen and it was at USC.

00:38.684 --> 00:43.335
The meeting was at USC and I walked in and

00:44.294 --> 00:49.739
And some were very gracious to me, and others said, what the hell are you doing here?

00:50.840 --> 00:53.682
And so it was kind of a mixed bag.

00:54.142 --> 00:57.766
But anyway, the result was that I participated.

00:58.006 --> 01:01.469
I tried to be cordial to everybody.

01:02.510 --> 01:13.339
I had learned how to be in a group of professional historians and accept the fact that I was either going to be

01:13.994 --> 01:19.004
aloof and alone, or I would have to make the special effort to get involved.

01:19.465 --> 01:22.350
And so I did my best to try to integrate.

01:23.072 --> 01:31.007
And then after that, they voted to admit three women, only three women.

01:31.428 --> 01:34.855
And they were from Whittier College.

01:35.003 --> 01:36.045
Yes, Whittier College.

01:37.088 --> 01:44.224
They had one woman in medieval history at USC, and they had another woman at Pomona.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.869
So we were invited to join.

01:47.290 --> 01:51.520
And that was the beginning of the breakthrough for all women in history.

01:51.580 --> 01:54.767
But I think that's an interesting story to tell.

01:54.747 --> 01:58.734
And so then I stayed at Cal State.

01:58.794 --> 02:00.316
I did very well at Cal State.

02:00.336 --> 02:02.099
They double-jumped me to full professor.

02:02.139 --> 02:10.754
I won the very first Distinguished Teaching Award given in the California State University System by the California State Legislature.

02:10.774 --> 02:18.527
And of course, our college was very honored that it came from them.

02:18.507 --> 02:37.208
And so that was the point at which Robert, the dean of geosciences then, Earl Cook, he called and asked Robert if he could come and see him when he was going to be in Southern California, and Robert said,

02:38.723 --> 02:41.248
I don't know what he wants, but he said, yes.

02:41.308 --> 02:46.057
And I said, well, I think he's going to invite you to come to Texas A&M University.

02:46.097 --> 02:47.600
He said, me?

02:47.620 --> 02:49.123
I said, yes, I know.

02:49.143 --> 02:51.848
I said, that's exactly what's going to happen.

02:52.610 --> 02:55.435
And sure enough, that was it.

02:55.455 --> 03:00.124
So he wanted Robert to come and to start a program.

03:00.104 --> 03:06.516
in exploration, in geophysics exploration.

03:07.297 --> 03:18.497
And Robert, by that time, was very well known as an international scientist in the field of radar and sonar and that whole area.

03:18.538 --> 03:23.226
He had only 28 international patents and so on.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.623
So they wanted him to start the program down here.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.467
And so he went, and he came back.

03:30.587 --> 03:35.553
And my husband is a very independent person.

03:35.953 --> 03:40.498
He likes to be in charge and not answer to anybody.

03:41.019 --> 03:41.800
That was the only thing.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.662
He didn't want to go into administration.

03:44.042 --> 03:47.967
He wanted to do research, and he wanted to do the kind of research that he wanted to do.

03:48.567 --> 03:53.533
And so when Earl Cook offered him this opportunity,

03:53.513 --> 03:56.659
The head of the department at the time was Terry Spencer.

03:57.280 --> 04:07.759
And Terry Spencer had been a good friend of Bob's when he was, they were working together in research at California Research Institute.

04:09.022 --> 04:16.275
So Bob was getting to the stage where he didn't want to do any of the administrative work.

04:16.876 --> 04:19.020
And this looked like a wonderful opportunity.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.865
They really were to get him, set up everything for him.

04:22.246 --> 04:23.848
And he could do whatever he wanted.

04:23.869 --> 04:33.105
And so he went down, and he came back, and he liked it a lot.

04:33.963 --> 04:36.927
And he said, what do you think about that?

04:36.947 --> 04:40.873
I said, oh, I don't want to go to Texas.

04:40.893 --> 04:42.074
I don't want to leave here.

04:42.455 --> 04:45.539
By that time, I had been double-jumped to full professor.

04:45.559 --> 04:53.190
I was the chair of graduate studies in the social sciences.

04:54.732 --> 05:00.240
And they were going to give me a year's sabbatical with full pay.

05:02.363 --> 05:15.512
So it was, I mean, it just, and I wanted that year so badly because I'd been doing a lot of research and I wanted to get out another book and so I just, it was just heartbreaking for me.

05:15.652 --> 05:18.398
But I knew how much he wanted to go.

05:18.378 --> 05:25.410
So apparently he told Cook about the situation.

05:25.470 --> 05:27.354
So I don't know what Cook did.

05:27.834 --> 05:30.299
But anyway, the result was that I got a letter.

05:30.800 --> 05:36.229
Would I please come and interview at Texas A&M in the history department?

05:36.750 --> 05:37.852
This is 1968.

05:37.912 --> 05:41.398
1968.

05:41.378 --> 05:44.162
So I said, well, I'll go and see.

05:45.103 --> 05:47.787
So I'll never forget that flight.

05:48.147 --> 05:51.332
Davis Airlines was running at that time.

05:51.992 --> 05:56.338
And so we took a regular scheduled flight into Houston.

05:56.358 --> 06:01.986
Then they put us up at some seven seasons or two seasons, hotel and host.

06:01.966 --> 06:02.927
in Houston.

06:02.947 --> 06:03.888
It was very nice.

06:04.469 --> 06:07.092
And Horace Byers was the dean.

06:07.553 --> 06:09.395
I was impressed with Horace Byers.

06:09.695 --> 06:13.600
I thought that he was my idea of what an academic ought to be.

06:14.481 --> 06:26.074
And so we spent the night and then the next day it was raining and I had no idea what this part of Texas was like.

06:26.154 --> 06:28.497
I thought it would be like a desert.

06:29.202 --> 06:43.307
And we flew in on this little plane, and I sat next to the pilot in the plane and just watched everything as we flew in this tiny little plane into College Station.

06:43.888 --> 06:47.495
And College Station was something else at that time, as you recall.

06:48.617 --> 06:52.003
I remember...

06:51.983 --> 06:53.945
I was not terribly impressed.

06:54.987 --> 07:04.018
In any case, I met with the various officials here and Horace Byers and with Earl Cook.

07:04.038 --> 07:10.466
And at that time, the College of Liberal Arts, there was no separate College of Liberal Arts.

07:10.506 --> 07:13.890
It was liberal arts and education together.

07:13.870 --> 07:17.897
And the head of that was, I'm trying to think of his name.

07:18.498 --> 07:18.759
Frank Hubert.

07:18.779 --> 07:19.400
Frank Hubert.

07:19.540 --> 07:19.801
Yes.

07:20.041 --> 07:20.442
Okay.

07:20.542 --> 07:24.249
So I had to interview with Frank Hubert.

07:25.170 --> 07:27.214
And so we had a nice visit together.

07:27.254 --> 07:35.389
And then they said, and then Milton Nance was the head of the department at the time.

07:35.369 --> 07:42.401
And so Milton Nance, of course, interviewed me, and he took Bob and me out to dinner.

07:42.842 --> 07:51.657
And at that time, there was no place of, well, what can I say?

07:51.637 --> 07:56.263
There was no good restaurant in College Station or Bryan.

07:56.784 --> 08:02.932
And so he took us out to Caldwell, to the Caldwell Inn.

08:02.952 --> 08:03.353
Surrey Inn.

08:03.753 --> 08:05.576
The Surrey Inn at the time.

08:05.836 --> 08:06.778
Right, exactly.

08:07.318 --> 08:09.621
And he said this was the best place to eat around.

08:10.182 --> 08:19.635
And so we had dinner together, and I visited with Dr. Nance.

08:20.746 --> 08:23.849
He was a little intimidating.

08:23.869 --> 08:24.250
Intimidated?

08:24.570 --> 08:25.731
Intimidating.

08:26.732 --> 08:27.393
Yes, yes.

08:27.493 --> 08:32.418
He was, it sounded very much like he ruled the roost.

08:33.199 --> 08:36.883
And all your textbooks were chosen by the department.

08:38.205 --> 08:44.571
And you even had to turn in your tests to him for scrutiny.

08:45.172 --> 08:49.977
And his view was that if you were an historian, you could teach everything.

08:49.957 --> 08:57.087
And so we talked about what the possibilities were.

08:57.107 --> 09:06.180
And since I already had this great repertoire in history, I could teach anything and had taught everything.

09:06.861 --> 09:11.327
But so we parted amicably.

09:11.447 --> 09:19.879
I must say I was a little concerned about some of his views.

09:21.378 --> 09:31.050
I was concerned about the whole segregation business, and I didn't appreciate some of the things they had to say on that subject.

09:31.851 --> 09:38.699
And so I was not terribly enthusiastic about what it might be like to be here.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.082
That's the way it was, Haskell.

09:41.823 --> 09:50.794
And there were no women in the department, although they had a lecturer at the time, a woman, Bonnie

09:50.774 --> 09:56.704
She was married to a person in the philosophy department.

09:57.946 --> 09:58.147
Stadelman.

09:58.167 --> 09:59.208
Stadelman, yeah.

09:59.229 --> 10:00.871
Barney Stadelman.

10:02.354 --> 10:11.770
So then they said, well, there's no way that you could possibly be appointed without being interviewed by the president of the university.

10:11.750 --> 10:14.875
My husband, of course, had not been interviewed by the president.

10:15.256 --> 10:23.769
I mean, this was a big thing, because if I was going to be appointed, I would be the first woman full professor appointed at this university.

10:24.170 --> 10:25.872
So this was a big step, of course.

10:26.774 --> 10:35.968
And I didn't think so at the time, but of course, from the perspective of this being an all-male institution, it was.

10:35.948 --> 10:41.636
And so Horace Byers, I'll never forget what he told me, he said, you just let me handle your background.

10:41.696 --> 11:00.522
And by that time, my book had come out, and of course it had been reviewed very well, both pro and con, but it had been reviewed in the Soviet Union, and it had been reviewed in Pravda.

11:00.502 --> 11:07.682
And they had labeled me a bourgeois revisionist and a lackey of capitalism.

11:08.705 --> 11:11.112
No finer review have I ever had.

11:11.152 --> 11:14.882
I'll tell you.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.666
It was the great publicity.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.272
And so Horace Byer said, I'll handle it.

11:22.313 --> 11:27.085
So he took me in to visit with President Rudder.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.672
And this was 1968.

11:30.053 --> 11:31.757
You know, this was the height.

11:31.737 --> 11:35.260
And this is down in what we then called the system administration.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.842
Yes, in the system administration building.

11:38.002 --> 11:38.243
Right.

11:38.763 --> 11:40.705
And so then Bob went with me.

11:41.706 --> 11:48.091
And so President Rutter asked Robert a few things about football.

11:48.651 --> 11:52.955
And of course, my husband, I mean, is such a football fan.

11:53.516 --> 12:01.002
I mean, the idea of coming to an institution that might have a good football team was just the greatest

12:00.982 --> 12:05.874
adjunct to an appointment here that you could possibly have.

12:06.395 --> 12:08.440
So he just thought it would be wonderful.

12:09.322 --> 12:13.472
And he'd finally have a football team, a winning football team, he thought.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.690
And so they talked a little bit about football.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.632
And then President Renner talked to me.

12:20.732 --> 12:23.054
But Horace Byers first told him.

12:23.094 --> 12:28.019
He said, now, she's an expert in Soviet-American relations.

12:28.519 --> 12:30.481
And she's got these publications.

12:30.841 --> 12:35.805
And she's also won distinguished teaching awards.

12:35.905 --> 12:38.147
And he said, and she's also.

12:38.248 --> 12:43.472
And then he proceeded to tell him about my being a bourgeois revisionist and the lack of capitalism.

12:43.552 --> 12:44.573
That did it.

12:44.553 --> 12:49.299
I mean, this was 1968, and that was very important.

12:49.960 --> 12:55.467
And so Rudder, President Rudder, apparently approved.

12:56.288 --> 13:00.554
Do you remember any questions he asked you?

13:00.574 --> 13:02.256
No, I don't remember any.

13:02.276 --> 13:03.858
So it was a conversation?

13:03.878 --> 13:05.160
It was a conversation.

13:05.340 --> 13:06.682
It was not an interview.

13:07.103 --> 13:09.566
And he was very, very nice.

13:09.966 --> 13:11.168
I liked the man.

13:11.654 --> 13:17.890
And I didn't feel any sense of being talked down to in any way.

13:17.950 --> 13:25.369
And so I went away with a good feeling about him, certainly.

13:26.311 --> 13:29.038
And that was that.

13:29.491 --> 13:40.585
Well then, when the offer came, and Horace Byers had said, now when you come, we'd like you to try to build up the program here.

13:41.026 --> 13:51.399
He said, we want to expand the history department, and we want to internationalize it, make it more than just American history, et cetera.

13:51.419 --> 13:54.883
And he said, would that be something you'd like to do?

13:54.923 --> 13:57.246
And I said, yes, I would like to do that.

13:57.266 --> 13:58.688
I've always liked to do

13:59.005 --> 14:00.326
pioneering sorts of things.

14:03.049 --> 14:07.354
But I said, there's no way you can have any graduate program in history with that library.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.558
I said, that library is dismal.

14:11.578 --> 14:20.388
And I had just had the job of building up the library at Cal State Fullerton, getting all the kinds of primary sources that are necessary for a graduate program and all that kind of thing.

14:20.988 --> 14:27.375
So I said, there's just no way you can have any graduate work in history without building up the library, I said.

14:27.355 --> 14:37.679
So that I would be very reluctant to come and not have, even for my own research, the basic kinds of materials that you could work with.

14:38.360 --> 14:46.258
And so the result was that they asked me to make out a list of what I thought the library ought to buy.

14:46.238 --> 14:53.194
And then there was this guide to historical literature that was out at that time.

14:53.796 --> 15:02.897
And they said, would I go through the guide to historical literature and check the things I thought were basic for a library to have?

15:02.877 --> 15:05.019
and that they would get them for me.

15:05.319 --> 15:07.001
Well, this was wonderful.

15:07.522 --> 15:10.865
I mean, I thought this was just really great that they were going to do this.

15:11.265 --> 15:17.431
Well, the result was that they began that whole microfilm program from the National Archives.

15:17.731 --> 15:28.682
They ordered everything that you could get on microfilm from East Europe all the way across through Asia, which was the area that I was most interested in.

15:28.662 --> 15:34.348
And so that's how we started that whole, the building of the library at that time.

15:35.168 --> 15:39.072
And that was a wonderful resource for our students, as it turned out.

15:39.533 --> 15:42.215
And then I did what they suggested.

15:42.336 --> 15:53.927
I did check everything I felt was important in the literature, that guide to historical literature, which fortunately came out that time.

15:53.907 --> 15:58.657
Mrs. Berg was the librarian, the reference librarian.

15:59.258 --> 15:59.439
Joe Berg.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.804
Joe Berg, yes, Joe Berg.

16:01.824 --> 16:07.877
And so I worked with her at the time, and she was a real pro.

16:08.538 --> 16:13.148
I just appreciated so much her help.

16:13.128 --> 16:25.628
in getting the things that I thought were really essential for work in both Russian history, American-Russian relations, American-East Asian relations at the time, and so on.

16:26.389 --> 16:28.092
And she was just wonderful.

16:28.292 --> 16:31.137
I later nominated her for that distinguished

16:31.117 --> 16:44.206
award in library because I was so impressed with her and so appreciative of her help to a faculty member who really was interested in, committed actually, to building the library.

16:44.747 --> 16:50.239
So anyway, that was one of the pleasures of being here.

16:50.219 --> 16:57.751
And then, of course, there were so, I mean, when I think of the stories, there were hardly any women here.

16:58.832 --> 17:04.481
And the few women that were here felt very much alone.

17:05.663 --> 17:14.356
And they, so I decided that I would start a woman's consciousness raising group.

17:17.001 --> 17:19.264
And so we began.

17:19.852 --> 17:22.396
Was that the name of it?

17:22.416 --> 17:22.837
Yeah.

17:22.857 --> 17:23.618
Well, I don't know.

17:23.658 --> 17:27.123
We just called it a women's group, but it was sort of consciousness raising.

17:27.163 --> 17:46.393
So we'd be able to adjust and adapt and understand the situation that we were in and learn how to adjust and adapt and hopefully bring about change and not be so frustrated with our situations, et cetera.

17:46.754 --> 17:47.715
Who were the key?

17:47.695 --> 17:50.078
Who were the key?

17:50.098 --> 17:51.139
Ethel Tsutsui.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.824
She was in science.

17:54.844 --> 18:00.972
Then there was a woman in English who's, I think, still here, Harriet.

18:02.974 --> 18:03.495
Harriet.

18:05.958 --> 18:09.362
This is 30 years ago, and I'm having trouble remembering names.

18:10.363 --> 18:12.226
Anyway, she was in English.

18:12.766 --> 18:15.790
Then there was a woman in sociology who was still here.

18:15.810 --> 18:17.432
She's a full professor now.

18:18.982 --> 18:29.481
Then later on, there was a woman, Diane, who became the associate dean here.

18:36.700 --> 18:40.466
Well, this is something I would have to look up to get all of their names.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.430
And then they changed over time.

18:43.611 --> 18:46.535
As new women came, they would come into the group.

18:46.655 --> 19:01.999
And so we tried to help one another in learning the ropes about how you managed to get tenure and how you adjusted in departments where you were alone.

19:03.515 --> 19:14.114
how you might bring about change and my own experience had been that you never do it through confrontation.

19:14.735 --> 19:25.354
So I tried to help them to realize that in the long run I felt that you could bring about change more effectively if

19:26.937 --> 19:34.748
if you didn't use anything that might be sort of like violence.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.913
Did y'all move here in the summer?

19:38.254 --> 19:39.656
Yes, we moved in the summer.

19:40.216 --> 19:44.743
And when we first arrived, it was boiling hot.

19:44.960 --> 19:56.378
And when we drove in and drove down Texas Avenue, you could almost see the heat rising from the asphalt and not a tree in sight.

19:57.240 --> 20:11.963
And then we had bought this house, which was in the process of being finished, so we had a chance to design parts of it and so on.

20:11.943 --> 20:30.971
And we came and there were these little, actually they weren't little, they were houses that were in this barren space with no trees and it just looked like the wilderness with these nice houses on it.

20:30.991 --> 20:33.715
They were nice houses.

20:34.488 --> 20:40.137
Just mud in the yard and mud in the back and clay, dry clay at that point.

20:40.157 --> 20:41.799
And when it rained, it was just mud.

20:42.620 --> 20:47.328
And our children were just distraught.

20:48.129 --> 20:50.693
They did not like it at all.

20:50.853 --> 20:52.436
This was in Bryan?

20:52.576 --> 20:54.399
This was in Bryan at the time.

20:54.439 --> 20:55.420
Your house was in Bryan?

20:55.480 --> 20:57.323
Yes, it was on Oak Ridge Drive.

20:58.923 --> 21:05.620
And it was, I did everything I could to try to get them involved and adjusted.

21:05.741 --> 21:11.596
But after California, it was just, it was really the desert for them.

21:11.656 --> 21:13.019
What was it like?

21:13.039 --> 21:15.987
How did the department react to your company?

21:16.574 --> 21:21.702
Well, on the surface, people seemed to be nice.

21:22.684 --> 21:26.831
No one said anything directly to me, but I heard.

21:28.012 --> 21:34.583
It was the kind of whisperings that you'd overhear or somebody else would tell you.

21:34.563 --> 21:50.444
And I'm sure it was very nice for a lot of them to have this woman from the West Coast be brought in as a full professor, never having gone through the tenure process here, which I would have passed without any difficulty.

21:51.205 --> 21:56.892
And no one.

21:58.492 --> 22:01.556
No one ever came and said, would you like to go to lunch?

22:03.018 --> 22:10.207
And so I just, I felt like an outcast, to tell you the truth, Haskell.

22:10.428 --> 22:11.629
It was not very pleasant.

22:12.530 --> 22:16.836
And then I'd heard these stories about, you know, what they thought about me.

22:16.876 --> 22:19.099
I'm sure I was threatening.

22:19.585 --> 22:23.190
I was threatening back at Cal State.

22:23.310 --> 22:35.847
It's a hard thing to adjust to someone coming in from the outside and maybe making a better salary than you do, or certainly having a higher rank than you do.

22:36.668 --> 22:42.776
And so it was not a very pleasant experience.

22:42.796 --> 22:45.159
Do you remember any incident?

22:46.722 --> 22:49.305
Just overhearing one of the professors say, we'll get her.

22:52.103 --> 23:02.054
And I was very unhappy with the way I thought the department was run.

23:02.134 --> 23:03.836
I think I've told you this story.

23:04.957 --> 23:09.962
Where I had come from was very democratic.

23:10.082 --> 23:11.224
It wasn't a head.

23:11.244 --> 23:13.386
It was a chairperson.

23:13.927 --> 23:18.972
And so at faculty meetings, even though

23:22.782 --> 23:24.264
Women had a hard time.

23:24.585 --> 23:25.887
There was no question about it.

23:26.207 --> 23:27.850
When I left, I was the only woman.

23:28.010 --> 23:30.694
When I got there, I was the only woman in the department.

23:31.856 --> 23:41.230
The one thing that did happen when I was at Cal State, though, was I always made a great effort to be fair in everything that I did.

23:41.210 --> 23:54.891
And the result was that they elected personnel committees so that I was elected to be the chair of the personnel department in the department and then in the college and then in the university.

23:55.953 --> 24:04.686
And so I had really learned the art of reading applications and interviewing and

24:05.223 --> 24:16.532
You know, there is one quality I have that I really have learned to respect, and that is I have excellent taste in people.

24:17.575 --> 24:31.093
I just, I don't know why that is or how it is, but I've always had the knack or the ability to choose really good people, even if it's to work for me as secretary.

24:31.674 --> 24:38.082
And I've been very, very fortunate so that I just was always able to do that.

24:38.062 --> 24:41.206
And so I had learned about personnel.

24:41.246 --> 24:49.697
I'd learned, you know, I'd gone through the business of having women's applications coming in and listening to all the men and hearing what they had to say.

24:49.777 --> 24:58.028
And the remarks very often didn't have anything to do with their academic ability, but with their physical attributes, et cetera.

24:58.008 --> 25:10.006
And I'd even gone through an experience where I had decided the only way for them to understand what they were doing was to use that same approach myself with men.

25:10.427 --> 25:18.379
I'll never forget it, because it was with a historian who later became the head of the department at University of Hawaii, at which I had taught, incidentally.

25:18.359 --> 25:29.874
And when I went to Hawaii, they had invited me to come to teach because they'd never had a woman, and they thought that if I came, I would help them to learn how to adjust to having a woman professor.

25:30.174 --> 25:36.743
I'll never forget John White at the time was the head of the history department in Hawaii, and that's exactly what he said to me.

25:37.043 --> 25:44.974
He said, we need to have some experience in knowing how to work with a woman professor in our department, so would you come?

25:45.955 --> 25:48.298
And I said, yes, I'd be glad to do that.

25:48.278 --> 25:51.182
But that's the way the situation was.

25:51.282 --> 25:53.946
I mean, men were concerned about how you did it.

25:56.049 --> 25:58.152
But in any case, I'll never forget you, Haskell.

25:58.172 --> 25:59.554
I think I've told you this before.

26:00.015 --> 26:13.054
Because you and Larry Hill were the only persons in a department meeting that ever spoke up and opposed a viewpoint of the department head.

26:13.034 --> 26:18.881
And so I looked at both of you with great admiration because I thought, this is the way it ought to be.

26:18.961 --> 26:26.110
And everybody else just sits there and they got talked to, but very rarely participated.

26:26.330 --> 26:32.537
But you guys would get in there and you really confront Professor Nance and say what you thought.

26:32.677 --> 26:39.025
And I thought some of the things you had to say sounded very reasonable and, dare I say it,

26:39.005 --> 26:40.747
even, quote, liberal.

26:43.711 --> 26:50.459
So I didn't like department meetings.

26:51.019 --> 27:03.034
I didn't like all this business of having to have your textbook selected for you and having to report about your tests to the department head.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.459
But I will say this, Haskell.

27:07.996 --> 27:15.664
I never had any problem of disrespect with a student at Texas A&M.

27:15.684 --> 27:19.028
And they might have thought it was peculiar to have a woman come into class.

27:19.168 --> 27:24.694
And I know at times that when I first went into class, they thought probably I was a secretary.

27:25.075 --> 27:26.917
So they wait for the professor to come in.

27:27.377 --> 27:33.784
Or they probably think I was coming in to say that the professor is late or something of that kind.

27:33.764 --> 27:36.007
But they gradually got used to it.

27:36.307 --> 27:39.010
I had a little difficulty at first getting used to them.

27:39.411 --> 27:53.187
First of all, I couldn't get used to these men coming in with blue jeans and boots and hats on and keeping their hats on through the entire class period.

27:53.727 --> 27:56.751
And then another thing was they chewed tobacco.

27:57.929 --> 27:59.792
And they'd come into class.

28:00.192 --> 28:01.875
You remember those big classes we had?

28:02.216 --> 28:03.397
And they were sort of staggered.

28:04.058 --> 28:09.767
And I remember the first year I was there, I was here.

28:09.827 --> 28:16.337
I'd be lecturing away, and I'd hear this kind of plop.

28:17.799 --> 28:19.482
And then I'd wait.

28:20.727 --> 28:21.568
And that was it.

28:22.169 --> 28:23.110
And then I'd go on.

28:23.150 --> 28:25.794
A little bit later I hear another plop.

28:26.495 --> 28:28.358
Didn't know what it was.

28:28.378 --> 28:31.362
And finally I looked up and I saw one student.

28:31.543 --> 28:38.753
He had one of those paper Coke cups between his boots and he was spitting into it.

28:38.902 --> 28:47.220
And that's when I realized that that wad that I saw them chewing was not gum, but that it was tobacco.

28:48.162 --> 28:55.037
And I see occasionally, I think some of the students had teeth that were sort of yellow.

28:55.017 --> 28:59.403
And I noticed that, and I thought, I wonder what this is all about.

28:59.723 --> 29:02.667
And then, of course, realized that it was the chewing tobacco.

29:03.248 --> 29:06.752
And it was very common across the campus.

29:07.594 --> 29:15.324
So that, I mean, you just got used to seeing these students with these wads in their mouth chewing away on tobacco.

29:15.664 --> 29:24.636
In that first year, did you encounter any inappropriate behavior by the students toward you

29:25.207 --> 29:26.972
Never, never.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.940
Nobody ever asked a question that was inappropriate?

29:29.960 --> 29:30.461
Nobody ever?

29:30.822 --> 29:31.885
I can't remember.

29:31.925 --> 29:33.349
And I used to say that.

29:33.429 --> 29:36.938
In fact, in 19, what was it?

29:38.217 --> 29:39.138
I think it was 1986.

29:39.218 --> 29:47.270
I was invited to go back to University of California at Irvine as visiting distinguished professor.

29:47.971 --> 29:52.157
And I went back and I thought, oh, California, the standards are really high.

29:52.217 --> 29:54.360
You hear all about how great everything is.

29:54.400 --> 30:00.208
And, you know, maybe I'll have some really good students.

30:00.509 --> 30:04.941
But I found that the situation was entirely different.

30:05.222 --> 30:10.155
I mean, they might talk about we being a cow college and all that sort of thing.

30:10.455 --> 30:15.970
But the fact was that you never had any disrespectful students.

30:15.950 --> 30:23.261
I mean, they might have difficulty at times complaining about the reading as they always did, etc.

30:23.701 --> 30:26.085
But never any disrespect.

30:26.205 --> 30:27.807
There was always yes ma'am.

30:27.988 --> 30:29.370
I couldn't get used to that at first.

30:29.630 --> 30:32.574
Everything was yes ma'am and yes sir.

30:32.995 --> 30:36.380
And my children learned to say yes ma'am and yes sir.

30:36.881 --> 30:39.104
And I certainly am grateful for that.

30:39.545 --> 30:41.788
I mean, my son still...

30:42.275 --> 30:45.000
says yes sir and yes ma'am.

30:45.902 --> 30:55.158
And I think that I look back at it now and I realize that you didn't have that when I went back to California.

30:55.759 --> 31:00.047
I mean there was this kind of

31:01.006 --> 31:06.215
Well, it wasn't, it was not a planned disrespect.

31:06.776 --> 31:11.104
It was just, that's the way they treated everything, with a kind of casualness.

31:11.504 --> 31:24.567
And of course, when you're very close to the beach, as they were, there was a lot of skipping classes, and there was a lot of not being properly prepared.

31:24.547 --> 31:33.426
So that I came back and I felt like our students were better.
