00:06.359 --> 00:08.304
This was May of 1960. 1960. Don had been offered a 
fellowship for a graduate program. They wanted

00:14.339 --> 00:16.124
him to stay on for a graduate program. But since I 
was six months pregnant and had to terminate, he

00:16.886 --> 00:21.718
didn't have summer employment. we knew we didn't 
have, we couldn't financially make it through the

00:22.255 --> 00:30.503
summer, so he decided to accept his job offer with 
ARCO and for us to leave. How well, as you all began

00:30.983 --> 00:42.834
to get into the realities, how well prepared did 
you think A&M had made the two of you for real life?

00:43.014 --> 00:43.595
For the real life?

00:46.618 --> 00:50.001
I can only speak for the oil company situation 
because At that time, you had a year's training

00:50.487 --> 00:53.956
under them. And you went through all the different 
phases. You went through chemical engineering.

00:59.670 --> 01:01.054
You went through production. You went through 
refinery.

01:05.573 --> 01:12.261
And so you knew that the whole first year you would 
be two or three months in one location, and then

01:05.573 --> 01:12.261
you'd be moved to the next phase. And then you would 
take a permanent assignment, production and

01:12.761 --> 01:18.128
drilling and so forth. As it turned out, as Donald 
went through that, our first assignment was in

01:18.148 --> 01:23.033
Longview. Then we went to Magnolia, Arkansas. And 
then we went to Midland, Texas. And then we went, I

01:30.161 --> 01:34.146
think, to Denver City, Texas. But I can remember 
that when it was all over the first year, Don

01:34.852 --> 01:49.355
realized that his real love was in the drilling, 
and he went into the drilling end of the petroleum

01:34.852 --> 01:49.355
engineering and liked it very much and stayed with 
it for a number of years. And sometime during the

01:51.098 --> 02:01.534
mid-60s, he was made an offer with Oracle 
Pipeline, and he went with the pipeline rather

01:51.098 --> 02:01.534
than the refining. All right, but did you feel that 
A&M had prepared him well? Technically, yes. And

02:09.105 --> 02:28.332
they didn't spend a lot of time on how to build a life 
other than just... All right, as you think back on

02:09.105 --> 02:28.332
those years when you all were students, if 
everybody from those years could be brought here

02:09.105 --> 02:28.332
right now, which ones would you most want to thank, 
give appreciation to?

02:35.980 --> 02:37.441
You mean the ones that I worked with? Anybody. Oh, 
well, of course, I'd certainly be very grateful to

02:39.323 --> 02:43.347
Mr. Benson. I truly loved him. And Mr. Horsley and 
his son still lives here today, and we talk about

02:44.929 --> 02:50.094
those things every once in a while. And I still see 
Mr. Hensel. I appreciated him. And Mr. McGuire, he

02:54.856 --> 03:01.024
just died last year, and I had stayed in touch with 
him throughout the years. Even after I left here,

03:02.205 --> 03:07.732
every year at Christmas time, Mr. Benson would 
send me a handwritten Christmas card. I was always

03:08.513 --> 03:12.759
amazed that he remembered a student wife because 
so many went through the office. But after my

03:13.720 --> 03:18.366
husband died, Mr. Benson was responsible for 
bringing me back here. And I shall always be

03:18.346 --> 03:20.569
grateful for that. So there were a lot of people who 
taught. And Dr. Winerdi, who's today president of

03:22.872 --> 03:29.081
Texas Medical Center, I really liked to work with 
Dr. Winerdi. He made it a challenge, and he made you

03:29.822 --> 03:32.586
stretch. And if you do that, you have to grow. 
There's no way you can do otherwise. And then, of

03:37.953 --> 03:45.484
course, I knew who John Calhoun was at that time, 
and I knew some of his work, and we did a little bit

03:37.953 --> 03:45.484
for him in our offices. And I admired these people 
greatly, and I still do today. I'm getting near the

03:50.914 --> 03:53.578
end of questions I can think of. What have we not 
covered from those student years? Well, the only

03:56.242 --> 04:03.072
other thing I was going to add is for a little 
additional income, I typed student papers for the

03:56.242 --> 04:03.072
students. And of course, I typed all of Don's 
papers. On what did you type them? A manual

04:08.040 --> 04:09.362
typewriter. And I didn't, an Olympic typewriter 
to be exact, a manual Olympic, had half space to it

04:10.034 --> 04:19.225
so you could type formulas. With the engineers you 
had to have half space so you could do the formulas.

04:24.191 --> 04:30.299
So I would type papers for my husband and Robert 
Lacey and any of the others that asked me to do so.

04:30.860 --> 04:34.424
What was the, if you did it for a fee, what was the 
fee? I think it was $25 a page, I mean 25 cents a page.

04:38.266 --> 04:40.351
Did you do theses and dissertations, Amber? No, 
just the class assignments. Okay, terrible. I

04:47.928 --> 04:49.491
reckon how often you did? Well, every week I had a 
paper to do for someone, and then I think he charged

04:50.568 --> 04:57.436
five cents a copy because we had to do carbon 
copies. There was no duplication other than that.

05:01.120 --> 05:07.708
I can remember typing a paper for Don one night, and 
he said, well, this just goes in the stack with the

05:01.120 --> 05:07.708
rest. We've been trashing a lot of them, and so I 
wadded it up and threw it in the trash. He said, no, I

05:11.532 --> 05:13.314
meant that's a perfect one. Keep it, and I ironed 
it. I spent probably an hour on it, so I can remember

05:16.077 --> 05:20.102
taking it out and ironing it. Do you remember any 
crises where you kept making an error and it wasn't

05:20.082 --> 05:30.413
easy to correct the errors then with all those 
carbon pages? Oh, yes, on those formulas, yes, you

05:30.663 --> 05:33.586
had a lot of those crises. I can remember the night 
before my daughter was born, Don had a major test,

05:34.187 --> 05:38.813
and it was on Saturday. We had Saturday classes at 
that time, and he had a geology test, and he had a lot

05:38.833 --> 05:56.113
of words he had to know, and he was asking me to call 
him out to him, and I remember dodecahedron to this

05:38.833 --> 05:56.113
day, that he had to tell me what it meant and had to be 
able to spell it, and we were still calling out

05:57.190 --> 06:02.138
words along about midnight and we finally decided 
to go to bed and she was born the next day. My water

06:02.198 --> 06:06.665
broke sometime during the night and to this day I 
still remember calling out those words. And he had

06:07.106 --> 06:14.978
to leave me at the hospital and come back to campus 
and take that major test because there was, you

06:07.106 --> 06:14.978
didn't dare miss a major test. Then he returned to 
the hospital. I think he made a nail on it. It was a

06:20.444 --> 06:22.346
different era. Now, when did you acquire that 
typewriter? Do you remember? We purchased it

06:26.491 --> 06:28.633
after we came here, yes. What did it cost? Oh, it 
might have cost $100. That was a lot of money at that

06:33.399 --> 06:34.740
time. Was it a new one? Yes, brand

06:35.601 --> 06:40.988
new. And you didn't have any crises of it breaking 
or anything? No, the only crises that we really

06:44.792 --> 06:47.515
ever had on equipment was... He did all of his 
formulas, of course, with slide rule. And we had a

06:51.119 --> 06:56.946
little table in our bedroom where he studied, and 
we had a little lamp over it, and he laid his slide

06:51.119 --> 06:56.946
rule down. And I left the light on at one time, and it 
warped just a little bit, and he had a major test the

06:57.026 --> 07:01.371
next day. So that was kind of a crisis. We didn't 
have any pocket computers. You did slide rule. I

07:07.919 --> 07:09.401
still have his slide rule today. Of course, a lot of 
people don't know what they are. Yes, yes. What

07:13.626 --> 07:17.130
else have we not touched on that you can think of? 
That's probably more than most people want to

07:17.617 --> 07:20.461
know. I will say that I never thought about coming 
back when I left here in 1960. I never thought about

07:27.833 --> 07:32.721
returning to Texas A&M, that that would be a major 
part of my life again. But I'm so thankful that not

07:36.348 --> 07:42.836
Glad for the reasons I came back, but that I have 
returned to A&M, and it's been a wonderful

07:36.348 --> 07:42.836
journey. Well, those of us that have had the honor 
to work with you are glad that that pleasure was

07:42.856 --> 07:48.562
ours. Then I have two questions left. One is, let's 
make believe that someone walked up to you and gave

07:52.927 --> 08:00.917
you a check for a million dollars with one 
condition. You must pass it on to Texas A&M and you

08:04.630 --> 08:07.453
decide what use they will make of the money. If you 
could make a million dollar gift to Texas A&M, for

08:08.294 --> 08:14.480
what cause would you have them spend the money? Oh, 
I would probably have to put it in scholarships.

08:18.444 --> 08:18.824
For whom? Just any student, and I wouldn't 
specify. I'd say needy students, because I think

08:22.608 --> 08:29.355
there's still a need today for students who do not 
have the money First-time graduates, first-time

08:31.158 --> 08:38.809
members out of a family who've ever been to 
college, they just don't realize what a benefit it

08:31.158 --> 08:38.809
really is for them. Don and I were first-time 
college students from our families with no

08:39.410 --> 08:46.439
financial support from either side. There were 
times we weren't sure we would make it

08:47.381 --> 08:54.170
financially, and if I had a gift, that's probably 
where I would have to leave it today. Okay, then the

08:55.392 --> 08:56.714
last question. What feelings do you hold in your 
heart for Texas A&M today? Oh, very high ones. I had

09:03.654 --> 09:16.396
planned to leave here when I got my children 
through college with their bachelor's degree and

09:03.654 --> 09:16.396
moved myself back to Dallas, and I realized I had 
put down roots and loved it very much, and A&M had

09:03.654 --> 09:16.396
been good to me, and this was home. And I'll retire 
from Texas A&M.
