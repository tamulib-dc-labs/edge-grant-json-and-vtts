00:02.883 --> 00:09.512
This is Deborah Beale, and I am interviewing Dr. 
David Norton on the history of the Texas

00:02.883 --> 00:09.512
Engineering Experiment Station. The date is June 
12, 1984. Are you ready to go ahead and start? And

00:16.702 --> 00:18.645
I'd like to start with just a little background. 
Let's start with your education and how you came to

00:18.745 --> 00:21.549
come here. OK. Let's see. You want to start at the 
college level of education? I came to A&M in 1958.

00:33.511 --> 00:48.365
as a student in mechanical engineering and did an 
ME, a bachelor of science, and then a master's of

00:33.511 --> 00:48.365
science. I graduated in 63

00:48.385 --> 01:00.396
and then went to Purdue and did a PhD in mechanical 
engineering and specialized in propulsion.

01:01.557 --> 01:07.204
Then, having been commissioned here, I was then 
ready for active duty. So I did active duty in the

01:08.525 --> 01:23.923
Ordnance Corps and was eventually assigned to the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,

01:08.525 --> 01:23.923
California on my tour of active duty after an 
officer's basic in the East Coast. Then I was out

01:23.944 --> 01:26.907
there two years. And then in January of 1970, I took 
an appointment here as an assistant professor in

01:28.135 --> 01:37.448
the aerospace engineering department. So I 
stayed in that capacity until January of 1982,

01:37.468 --> 01:48.344
basically. And which time I came over here and 
began as an assistant director for what was then

01:48.364 --> 01:56.235
called program. and am now the assistant director 
of research. When did you first become aware of

02:02.443 --> 02:06.469
Tunis? Probably my second day here. As a student or 
as a... No, not really as a student at all.

02:18.768 --> 02:26.560
Even my graduate research days

02:18.768 --> 02:26.560
in the early 60s, late 50s, TEAS, as you'll be 
finding out, was not as pervasive an influence as

02:27.181 --> 02:35.734
it is today in engineering research. For example, 
the mechanical engineering department really

02:37.176 --> 02:52.378
didn't interface a great deal with engineering 
department section, although a few faculty had

02:37.176 --> 02:52.378
done work through them and with them during the war 
and after. They operated the mechanical

02:53.624 --> 03:10.060
engineering department separately and worked 
out assistantships and fellowships separately

02:53.624 --> 03:10.060
and didn't really have much of a research program. 
As a matter of fact, the reason many of the colleges

03:10.080 --> 03:18.889
didn't have a real research program were only 
doing a very nominal amount of graduate work. and

03:19.409 --> 03:24.275
the need for funded research was not as large as it 
is today. So, it just really wasn't that pervasive

03:24.295 --> 03:28.600
of a factor. What was your first project through 
TEAS? Well, the excitement that brought me here,

03:32.485 --> 03:40.035
as opposed to the other places I was looking at, was 
the Space Shuttle. Professor Al Kronk, who was the

03:40.055 --> 03:42.818
department head at that time, in the interview 
process indicated to me that he had been asked by

03:43.051 --> 03:57.708
Johnson Spacecraft Center to develop capability 
in dealing with shuttle problems. And

03:57.728 --> 04:03.835
specifically, they had problems with 
propulsion, which was my specialty. So the offer

04:03.895 --> 04:08.721
to get involved and begin to do research on space 
shuttles was my inducement to come here because

04:09.460 --> 04:27.536
that was a major new exciting program that had all 
the disciplines that I was interested in going

04:09.460 --> 04:27.536
with it and it was yet had an applied side that was 
appealing to me that I'd be able to see this thing

04:09.460 --> 04:27.536
designed, developed, flown over the years. So 
that's the reason I came and that's the first

04:27.556 --> 04:31.860
research project. It was, I was under contract in 
NASA basically continuously for the next 12 years

04:31.880 --> 04:38.185
on this mission. I don't know if this is directly 
related to the propulsion, but the wind tunnel was

04:39.397 --> 04:45.907
used for that. Do you know what it was used for 
immediately before that? Before that major

04:48.852 --> 04:56.964
relationship was established between JSC and our 
air department, I think it was used to store hay.

04:57.646 --> 05:04.917
There was a period of time where it was basically 
unused or used sporadically at best in the 60s. As

05:04.937 --> 05:06.940
far as I could tell, It was basically unused for a 
period of time until the late 60s. In 69, it took

05:11.860 --> 05:30.784
some aid of NASA, old equipment, old recorder, old 
stuff, and some people that were sent up here to

05:11.860 --> 05:30.784
help us get modernized from JSC, a guy named Ray 
Moore.

05:30.804 --> 05:35.290
We had a lot of help from them in trying to get us 
developed as a facility where they could come do

05:36.620 --> 05:49.472
some testing and some evaluation that they would 
otherwise have to go to one of the major NASA

05:36.620 --> 05:49.472
centers, Langley or Ames, or hire down at one of the 
contractors, where they wouldn't really be a

05:36.620 --> 05:49.472
party to the work. So they could actually come in 
the lab and turn their roller shirt sleeves up, get

05:49.993 --> 05:58.621
in there and feel what was going on in a friendly, 
cooperative environment. And that's what they

05:58.641 --> 06:05.327
were looking for to establish here, and they did.

06:05.864 --> 06:08.527
change from director of programs to director of 
research. Was that a real change in the jobs? No, it

06:12.171 --> 06:13.332
was not. It was a change or a different 
recognition, I think, in that the research, the

06:13.493 --> 06:20.441
purpose of engineering firm station is research. 
It's not business. It's not research. And this, in

06:24.185 --> 06:33.856
essence, made it clear that this was, I was 
interested in a research position that led to, you

06:24.185 --> 06:33.856
know, the main heartbeat. I wasn't a peripheral I 
wasn't in anything else but Missouri. What is your

06:39.233 --> 06:40.575
job now? What do you do? My job and most of the jobs I 
already have is what I want it to be, basically.

06:52.709 --> 07:04.423
What I want it to be is developing the research 
potential of TEAS and Texas A&M for the benefit of

06:52.709 --> 07:04.423
the state. I'm very clear about that role. In my 
opinion, the role is to make the infrastructure,

07:11.476 --> 07:24.831
the technical infrastructure of Texas be as 
strong as possible. And at the same time, to

07:24.851 --> 07:29.736
develop that in the sense of research capability 
and technical manpower. The technical manpower

07:33.230 --> 07:55.620
we developed basically by providing assistance 
to graduate students through work, not through

07:33.230 --> 07:55.620
gifts, through work and assistantship and buying 
millions of dollars of equipment that is used for

07:33.230 --> 07:55.620
research but also is used to teach at the graduate 
and senior level of the undergraduate program. So

07:55.640 --> 08:00.246
in that way we developed the capabilities and the 
technical manpower pool. And we also take all this

08:00.698 --> 08:14.610
intellect that's here and make it, otherwise it's 
not available, make it available to the benefit of

08:00.698 --> 08:14.610
the state.

08:15.972 --> 08:22.637
To do that, you have to have a large enough pool that 
you have a group that can do almost anything. And

08:23.578 --> 08:30.064
when the state has a need, you are simply the 
conduit into that pool to apply it. And then when

08:31.411 --> 08:36.137
that need goes away, you tap into another part of 
the pool for another problem. You have to have this

08:36.157 --> 08:52.376
pool, and that takes a lot of work and support to 
keep that pool of 400 or 500 engineers going here,

08:36.157 --> 08:52.376
keep them bubbling up and exciting the students 
and developing their capabilities so that

08:36.157 --> 08:52.376
they're available. If you only had 100, you 
wouldn't be able to serve that role. You wouldn't

08:56.180 --> 09:00.085
be able to say, whatever the problem is, we have the 
talent. It takes this level of a group to keep the

09:00.925 --> 09:06.331
process going. How did you first get involved in 
administration of TEAS? Skip Porter called me. He

09:12.738 --> 09:14.360
said, I want you to be assistant director. I told 
him no twice. Finally, I told him yes. We started

09:19.606 --> 09:25.652
out on a half-time basis, a three-quarter time 
basis, and finally a full-time basis. Because I

09:25.672 --> 09:28.215
had other things that I was doing in Arrow. I was now 
a full professor over there, traveling

09:28.887 --> 09:32.835
internationally in my own research. I developed 
an environmental aerodynamics laboratory, and

09:34.358 --> 09:46.521
we were starting to do three, four hundred 
thousand dollars worth of research, and junior

09:34.358 --> 09:46.521
faculty and graduate students. Things were 
really bubbling over there. It was for some

09:49.981 --> 10:02.117
reluctance that I consider that, because I'm by no 
stretch of imagination, at least initially

09:49.981 --> 10:02.117
configured for administrative work. My 
strengths have always been the technical,

10:03.279 --> 10:15.195
personal sort of commitment, as opposed to 
getting other people to do things, but you can

10:03.279 --> 10:15.195
learn some of the skills. When did you get the 
environmental aerodynamics portion? No, it

10:19.447 --> 10:20.147
wasn't before. Environmental aerodynamics 
later. OK. OK, at this point, someplace around in

10:21.990 --> 10:43.596
the mid, another element of the story, my personal 
story, is about the mid-'70s, the enrollment of

10:21.990 --> 10:43.596
aerospace engineering, as an example, went from 
100, say, like 200 freshmen in the fall of 72 to like

10:21.990 --> 10:43.596
60 freshmen in the fall of 73. So there was a 
precipitous step function in enrollment. And in

10:51.133 --> 11:06.947
order to maintain the faculty, there were about 
nine or 10 at that time, active full-time faculty,

10:51.133 --> 11:06.947
it was clear that we were going to have to diversify 
and go heavily into research instead of being

10:51.133 --> 11:06.947
quarter-time research, be pre-quarter-time 
research. And those of us that looked around and

11:06.967 --> 11:10.350
said, well, where is the money? Where are we going 
to do that? We all did our own thing individually

11:14.677 --> 11:17.322
sought out other areas, or broaden their own 
areas. And one of the things I looked at was

11:18.324 --> 11:23.173
something called environmental aerodynamics, 
which is not propulsion. It is the flow of wind and

11:23.193 --> 11:31.369
its effect on man, buildings, and the sea, and 
offshore platforms, things like that. And

11:32.652 --> 11:37.461
at that time, that was something that was being 
developed nationwide. I went to Colorado State

11:40.634 --> 11:48.324
for eight weeks to where the United States' most 
prestigious guy is named Cermak. I spent eight

11:49.265 --> 11:52.890
weeks with him learning this branch of 
engineering. I brought that back here and over the

11:53.591 --> 11:59.099
next several years developed that as an area of 
study. I developed two courses, graduate courses

12:00.000 --> 12:04.326
and an area of research. So I did a great deal of 
that, in addition to whatever little bits of NASA

12:04.728 --> 12:13.364
work that was still to be done. Was this the group 
that was involved in the oil, or were you involved

12:13.765 --> 12:18.614
in the oil spill research? No. Well, yes, I have 
been involved in oil spill research, but not from

12:19.315 --> 12:28.592
the point of view of Roy Hand, who goes out when 
there's an oil spill and goes out and tries to

12:29.602 --> 12:32.825
analyze the situation and stuff like that. My 
involvement has been in terms of the fluid

12:32.845 --> 12:38.451
mechanics of how you skim it off the water. Well, 
that's the research that was done in the mid-'70s,

12:38.471 --> 12:42.555
right? Mm-hmm, right. And it developed a training 
program for them? Mm-hmm, eventually, yes,

12:46.059 --> 12:47.721
right. Did that start with the beginning of that 
lab? No, that lab was created, I think, about 1980.

12:55.329 --> 12:59.473
No, we were just loosely associated with people 
around the campus that were doing work in oil

12:59.875 --> 13:10.915
spill, and there was people in civil engineering, 
myself and Arrow and other people, and that was one

12:59.875 --> 13:10.915
of those opportunities that came along that I got 
involved with about two years. Whose brainchild

13:11.997 --> 13:13.119
was that? I don't know, it may go back to, I know 
Charlie Rodenberger was involved with a contract

13:14.140 --> 13:22.896
with the Department of Transportation. And it 
involved the Coast Guard, in which they were

13:23.922 --> 13:31.593
trying to find mechanisms to contain oil spill to 
sea, especially when there were the current.

13:32.574 --> 13:38.022
Because the booms that they had, the oil would just 
go unneeded, pile up against one side and get so

13:32.574 --> 13:38.022
deep and then go unneeded. So they were looking for 
ways to combat that tendency. And that's the kind

13:41.828 --> 13:44.952
of research that at least I was involved in. In the 
early and mid-'70s with the energy crisis, did

13:46.028 --> 13:53.620
that change the direction of your research? Not so 
much, except that one of the areas of research that

13:54.482 --> 14:01.814
I began to look at was generation of wind power by 
wind. So I added that into the things that we were

14:02.495 --> 14:06.822
doing in my lectures and courses. So I brought in 
that sense, but I didn't, I wasn't never just

14:07.392 --> 14:12.899
fundamentally in energy research. Did money for 
that type of thing become more readily available

14:12.919 --> 14:17.225
at that point? Uh, sure. And many, many people 
around the campus, like in chemical engineering

14:18.306 --> 14:30.302
and other places, lacked on to that, and that 
concept didn't get involved in a great deal of

14:18.306 --> 14:30.302
research. Everything from oil shales and all 
kinds of things. But I never personally got

14:34.307 --> 14:37.011
involved, not too much. But that was the time in 
which people began to do that, to get some of that

14:37.447 --> 14:42.652
Department of Energy money. Did you find that with

14:44.014 --> 14:56.706
the late 70s, when the popularity of the space 
program went downhill, was it harder to get money

14:44.014 --> 14:56.706
for your research? Sure. That's the reason why I 
was still doing work for them. It was not something

15:04.092 --> 15:11.479
that would be a full-time research activity, and 
so I needed to develop a parallel. Is that the same

15:11.499 --> 15:13.321
reason they're dropping students? Yeah, right. 
So there wasn't that much teaching. So... Not only

15:16.203 --> 15:20.587
did you have trouble getting money, but you didn't 
have the students as well? That's right. Okay. So

15:22.049 --> 15:31.738
you really had... You know, there was... Nobody 
would fire you, but on the other hand, you had a

15:22.049 --> 15:31.738
sense to keep the team together. And now we have... 
Well, we now have the largest aerospace

15:34.619 --> 15:38.424
engineering department in the country. We have 
something like 700 students, which is by far and

15:38.444 --> 15:41.749
away. We were down to like 100 students total. But 
we had the same teams there. And they're there

15:46.897 --> 15:51.603
because when the time came, we knew what to do to 
keep ourselves there. And so the role of playing

15:52.925 --> 16:01.537
back and forth between research and teaching and 
engineering, which is cyclical, is absolutely

15:52.925 --> 16:01.537
critical. If you don't have that flexibility, 
you're not going to make too many perturbations in

16:03.762 --> 16:07.205
this field. The aerospace is coming back. Oh, 
yeah. It's here. When did this new wave start?

16:15.973 --> 16:20.717
Well, it really started like a year or two after the 
big low. We've been plotting a curve. It's been

16:22.839 --> 16:24.721
going like that ever since. It's just been 10% per 
year or 20% per year, and it's just been going,

16:24.801 --> 16:29.104
going, going. What do you think precipitated 
that? Well, I think the next thing that

16:33.412 --> 16:36.977
Historically, it was the space shuttle. In 1969, 
we had landing on the moon, and we had the rest of the

16:37.557 --> 16:42.664
Apollo. And the Apollo came, and that was, oh, 
we're on the moon again. It just lost interest.

16:49.613 --> 16:50.774
Then we had a gap there. And meanwhile, in 1969, we 
started working on the shuttle. And it did its

16:54.599 --> 16:59.385
first flights in the mid-1974 or 75, I guess. so 
that was the next big big thing so about 75 the

16:59.855 --> 17:22.285
shuttle then they dropped tested it off the 747 and 
they did this they did that so that's uh begin to

16:59.855 --> 17:22.285
reawaken the american public a little bit but that 
and i think other things uh i think

17:23.750 --> 17:30.777
reconsideration of what we would do in defense, 
which is, of course, a big implore of aerospace

17:23.750 --> 17:30.777
people.

17:32.338 --> 17:41.006
Pretty good time as far as the airlines were 
concerned, and major programs to develop the 757

17:32.338 --> 17:41.006
and the 767. There was a number of little things 
that kept things parking alone. Who do you deal

17:47.432 --> 17:52.677
with as an administrator inside the system, 
inside the teams? That's the answer I'm getting

17:53.095 --> 17:57.082
from everybody. No, primarily it would be TASE, 
N-T-A-M-U, and in some cases other universities

17:57.102 --> 18:16.116
in the system, Prairie View, and also other 
research entities that are in this stage around

17:57.102 --> 18:16.116
the nation. How about outside the system? Who do 
you usually meet with? Well, we meet with the

18:23.472 --> 18:25.294
University of Texas at Arlington. I mean, this 
year I probably had four or five meetings with the

18:25.314 --> 18:33.826
University of Texas at Austin in terms of the water 
research and other things that we're trying to

18:25.314 --> 18:33.826
coordinate, you know, the feeling of cooperation 
with UT. Is that a new feeling? What? Is that a

18:35.669 --> 18:37.451
feeling of cooperation new? Yeah, it was, you 
know, right, right, fairly new. The last few

18:41.617 --> 18:42.799
years? The last two years. I think it's an impetus 
of the posture that the chancellors

18:45.188 --> 18:53.038
take. Do you deal with them in the state or national 
legislature? Yeah, we have the speaker of the

19:00.567 --> 19:10.098
house, Texas House here, and a couple of 
representatives. So yeah, we deal with this.

19:11.660 --> 19:13.002
We're a state agency. A lot of things happen over 
here that don't necessarily go through the

19:13.538 --> 19:21.929
university, so people come here and see the 
research. I know Jane Armstrong is the liaison.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.497
Yeah, she is our primary liaison. So are you the 
liaison with most of the other academic

19:27.557 --> 19:30.601
institutions? Yes. That would be right. When it 
comes to research and engineering research,

19:33.204 --> 19:42.837
probably that would be more what I would be doing 
when it comes to legislature or other Chamber of

19:43.171 --> 19:50.421
Commerce, other kinds of liaison that we want to 
build, Jane just generally is there. But we don't

19:50.441 --> 19:56.250
have any written instructions on that. How have 
changes in administration changed the way TEAS

19:56.891 --> 20:09.368
functions from your viewpoint?

20:09.388 --> 20:11.271
Well, first place, I came here when Fred Benson was 
in charge of most everything. So there was no

20:17.375 --> 20:23.343
changes for a decade or so. Between 1970 and 1978 or 
not, there were no changes. Then we had our big new

20:29.070 --> 20:41.106
organization and

20:29.070 --> 20:41.106
things have been sort of in a turmoil in terms of 
that ever since. That really has no effect in some

20:42.048 --> 20:47.293
senses, or it has all the effect. It just depends 
how much you want to watch it.

20:52.839 --> 20:58.104
I think we've been able to be as effective as we are 
because we've tried not to concentrate on it too

20:52.839 --> 20:58.104
much. We have a little expression we use around 
here. We like to just keep laying bricks. Let

21:05.932 --> 21:09.996
everybody else worry about it, but we just want to 
put another brick down. So that's really been what

21:10.212 --> 21:28.410
I've, while all those things have been happening, 
my feeling is that we just ought to continue to get

21:10.212 --> 21:28.410
opportunities to do research and continue to 
identify those who do the research and just keep

21:10.212 --> 21:28.410
our relationships at a high level. The funding 
agency is keeping going. Have there been any

21:31.533 --> 21:39.561
particular points in your memory, too, that have 
been some low points?

21:40.908 --> 21:46.513
when this broke down or was threatened? Well, I 
would say no.

21:51.937 --> 21:59.964
It's been very general, very high plane of 
professional activity over here all the way

21:51.937 --> 21:59.964
through. At least certainly my dealings with 
Skidport. So I haven't had the feeling, maybe a

22:05.749 --> 22:10.493
little lately,

22:15.670 --> 22:23.081
that we weren't able to take advantage of all the 
opportunities we could because things aren't

22:15.670 --> 22:23.081
settled in the administration. But it's factors 
external that's really keeping who we see dead

22:23.101 --> 22:31.694
ends because you can't get decisions or people are 
in place. You can't hire the people you want to

22:32.335 --> 22:36.001
because the apartment is not there, et cetera, et 
cetera. So those kind of things, but not as far as us

22:36.021 --> 22:43.172
within TEAS. We feel like that. There's

22:45.640 --> 22:55.412
plenty

22:45.640 --> 22:55.412
of opportunities to take advantage of it if the 
rest of the people want to. How much influence has

22:55.432 --> 23:00.758
the Research Foundation had on your work? The 
Research Foundation, I have a long history with

23:00.778 --> 23:04.282
the Research Foundation. I bet if you went over 
there you'd find that I've had more contracts with

23:04.302 --> 23:15.175
the Research Foundation than any researcher

23:04.302 --> 23:15.175
on campus. As a researcher dealing with the 
Research Foundation, although there have been

23:16.505 --> 23:34.364
minor frustrations, I've always felt that they 
were trying to help the researcher and

23:16.505 --> 23:34.364
there were such good people out there. What is not 
commonly understood by the faculty is that

23:42.053 --> 24:01.355
Research Foundation is indeed not an entity of the 
Texas A&M University System and employs no

23:42.053 --> 24:01.355
professional research faculty and is indeed a 
place to make things easier by verging on the fact

23:42.053 --> 24:01.355
that it's not part of Texas A&M. And I think if you 
would ask a typical new faculty member that he

24:01.375 --> 24:09.765
thinks he works for the Research Foundation and I 
think that they try to make them,

24:10.488 --> 24:19.037
not directly, but indirectly. And that causes 
some confusion as to who they report to, who's

24:19.057 --> 24:34.873
responsible for their political tenure, who are 
the people, indeed, that

24:19.057 --> 24:34.873
they should look to for their long-term support 
group. So in that sense, it's confusing to find

24:35.894 --> 24:39.297
out. And

24:40.137 --> 24:45.885
that's not a plus. On the other side, there are 
times when they handle kind of details that really

24:46.145 --> 24:52.114
nobody wants to get involved with. People want to 
take the time complying with OSHA and complying

24:52.194 --> 25:02.128
with all the federal regulations that apply to a 
contract and all the bookkeeping and such. They

25:02.148 --> 25:05.993
provide a valuable service.

25:08.420 --> 25:15.790
Were

25:08.420 --> 25:15.790
most of your contracts through them also 
involving teams? Sure, because any research I did

25:16.330 --> 25:19.454
involved teams. The contract would usually read, 
uh, the Research Foundation checks this contract

25:19.474 --> 25:32.812
and is named the Texas Engineering Experiment 
Station as the entity who will do the research. And

25:32.832 --> 25:37.077
the Texas Engineering Experiment Station is 
named Dr. Norton as the principal investigator.

25:37.985 --> 25:44.196
So every bit of research that I've ever done over 
the last 15 years has always been the engineering

25:37.985 --> 25:44.196
term extension. Now, only in the last few years has 
it been possible to do contracts directly with the

25:44.216 --> 25:54.095
engineering term extension without the research 
foundation involved at all. But I've always been a

25:55.978 --> 25:57.501
teaser for it. I've always gotten two or three 
paychecks, different ones. So, what is the

26:03.061 --> 26:09.351
difference between teams and researchers? Well, 
the Research Foundation is a not-for-profit,

26:09.371 --> 26:28.984
arm's length corporation that was set up to 
circumvent purchasing regulations in the state

26:09.371 --> 26:28.984
of Texas. for the purpose of doing,

26:30.635 --> 26:41.386
managing, in a fiscal sense, project accounting, 
which the university does not have. They don't

26:41.406 --> 26:44.409
have a project accounting system. So it was 
convenient for the university and everybody to

26:44.429 --> 26:54.640
invent this organization to do project 
accounting, to do purchasing, to do certain

26:44.429 --> 26:54.640
things like that. And it has No people except 
bookkeepers and lawyers.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.216
So in this far, it is useful to use them. And it's 
useful to use them. Oh, the other third and fourth

27:09.658 --> 27:20.434
thing was the university doesn't have a means to 
retain overhead on federal contracts.

27:20.454 --> 27:23.458
So they have no way of paying for the bookkeeping 
system. But the Research Foundation can. So they

27:26.903 --> 27:28.485
keep some of the overhead. to do the bookkeeping. 
The university wouldn't be able to because they

27:33.452 --> 27:36.136
had to give all the overhead back. So it made sense 
then for them to create, or us to create, this

27:37.618 --> 27:46.210
bookkeeping outfit that could absorb a little of 
the overhead to pay for itself. And then whatever

27:47.011 --> 27:50.817
was left over of the overhead, we shipped back to 
Austin. And they put in the general revenue. So it

27:53.701 --> 27:56.785
made sense in a couple of ways. It doesn't 
necessarily make the same sense in your

27:57.220 --> 28:00.924
interpretation. But we're here as a team, all our 
sister agencies, the TAs and the TTs, and the KTs

28:00.944 --> 28:06.569
and the TKFs. And if that's the common will, then 
we'll be glad to participate. But it's just

28:14.577 --> 28:16.078
something of convenience. It has no real A&M 
significance. It's not really a part of Texas A&M

28:21.143 --> 28:24.426
or Texas A&M. So has TEAS established some kind of 
system? Sure. Always had to. See, the Research

28:30.132 --> 28:33.155
Foundation does no state contracts. Not allowed 
to. So if you have a state contract with another

28:35.318 --> 28:39.282
agency, how do you do it? Well, you have to have your 
own book. We've always had it now. And we always

28:44.428 --> 28:46.670
send federal contracts for them. We always do the 
state contracts. The industrial contracts, we do

28:49.033 --> 28:53.518
about 50-50 when we think it makes sense. It 
doesn't require a lot of guaranteeing of this and

28:53.718 --> 28:57.564
that. We do them through here, right through our 
own shop. Good Lord, you got a shop. And it works out

29:03.212 --> 29:04.994
fine. When it's complicated and it needs 
something that they provide, then we send it over

29:06.036 --> 29:13.506
there. That explains a lot that I hadn't 
understood. And I don't think a lot of people

29:15.469 --> 29:18.053
understand. No. No. Almost nobody understands 
it.

29:25.122 --> 29:38.727
There were great changes

29:25.122 --> 29:38.727
in the 60s in terms of the building of the nuclear 
science center, the data processing center, and

29:25.122 --> 29:38.727
that type of thing. Did you see a lot of changes in 
the types of research that were going on in the 60s

29:40.242 --> 29:47.288
or 70s? Well, I wasn't here in the 60s, so I can't... 
No, in the 70s, I'm talking about. Okay. Any spurts

29:51.813 --> 29:59.079
of the same rapid change, you had the shuttle come 
in and... Yeah, well, that's just peculiar to my

29:51.813 --> 29:59.079
department. What was happening in the 60s is the 
leadership of a few really brave guys. We were...

30:10.178 --> 30:19.930
establishing capabilities at A&M that led us to be 
able to really operate in the 70s. Things like the

30:19.950 --> 30:32.105
Cyclotron, things like the NICU Science Center, 
things like, many things if you look around now and

30:19.950 --> 30:32.105
wonder where they got started, they got started 
here. And I'm sure you've talked to Dr. Capoon and

30:32.185 --> 30:35.349
Mark Will and Fred Benson. Those guys, and Rudder, 
look for ways to progress and establish

30:39.001 --> 30:42.945
capabilities. We built a building over here, the 
Space Research Center, the T building, NASA

30:43.706 --> 30:50.313
funds. Things like that were happening and we took 
a lot of risks and built a lot of facilities. Most of

30:57.601 --> 31:02.046
them worked out, some of them didn't. That's what I 
look back and think I see there is without much

31:02.106 --> 31:08.012
research capability, Before 1965, there really 
wasn't any research done here. Not that there

31:13.056 --> 31:17.202
wasn't some good research done, but the volume 
was. You could say that the research really didn't

31:18.684 --> 31:24.834
get started until then.

31:24.854 --> 31:38.134
So people were putting into place facilities and 
capabilities and programs that a university that

31:24.854 --> 31:38.134
didn't have a lot of traditional research could 
grab a hold of and begin to have a reason to do this.

31:39.447 --> 31:48.964
Those were very important steps in my mind, very

31:39.447 --> 31:48.964
far-reaching,

31:39.447 --> 31:48.964
brave steps to take. So by the time you got here, the 
facility was already here? There was a wind

31:50.507 --> 31:51.568
tunnel. Even though it wasn't active, it was 
there. There was a nuclear science center, and

31:53.432 --> 32:03.750
there was all these things here that had been 
constructed and built basically on

32:05.384 --> 32:06.866
on the feeling that would be important. Maybe they 
couldn't justify it all the way by the people that

32:07.387 --> 32:11.031
were here at the time. And certainly, you can't 
justify building a wind tunnel when you don't have

32:12.233 --> 32:17.460
an aerospace engineering department. But 
basically, that's what happened. Gilchrist

32:20.604 --> 32:22.146
built that wind tunnel. And everybody said, what a 
folly. And it was a folly for a long time. But it has

32:27.272 --> 32:31.678
also been a great source visitors and research and 
all kinds of activities that have helped make the

32:32.418 --> 32:40.149
repetition of A&E. What do you think that TEAS 
balances in terms of the testing services and the

32:40.169 --> 32:51.406
type of research? It's often asked, and I think 
everybody that asks it is really looking to

32:51.426 --> 33:00.079
confirm what they really believe about TEAS. 
First of all, you've got to understand that TEAS is

33:01.848 --> 33:07.517
really just about five or ten people up here. 
Everybody else is out there in the department. So

33:11.423 --> 33:20.477
when you say, what you're really asking is what do 
the faculty of Texas, of the College of

33:11.423 --> 33:20.477
Engineering and the other associated 
departments really do? That's what you're really

33:22.481 --> 33:23.803
asking. Through TEAS. Through TEAS, right. has 
$1.05 that they use to direct the program. The

33:34.129 --> 33:41.756
other four-fifths comes from the blood, sweat, 
and tears of the individual faculty member who go

33:34.129 --> 33:41.756
to Washington and say, I'm good. I'm going to do 
this research. You're going to fund me. And they

33:45.359 --> 33:47.841
take that proposal and send it around the country. 
And all his competitors mark it up. And if he wins

33:51.885 --> 33:55.168
the competition, he brings it back. So teeth 
didn't tell him what to do. He just did it, and we're

33:58.970 --> 34:02.914
the vehicle through which he does it. So when you 
say tease research, what you're really saying is,

34:02.934 --> 34:09.081
what do the faculty members, what do College of 
Engineering do? OK, now let's answer that

34:09.722 --> 34:11.463
question. They do whatever their conscience 
dictates and whatever they perceive that the

34:13.285 --> 34:22.856
administration would reward.

34:27.020 --> 34:28.842
There is an opportunity for those who feel they 
make contributions to this state, they certainly

34:29.193 --> 34:32.997
can mark one. If it involves some testing, that's 
fine.

34:41.466 --> 34:55.721
Frankly, testing always is a lower order on the 
economic research chain because it's usually

34:41.466 --> 34:55.721
dollars received for dollars of actual value 
delivered. If you do testing You propose

34:57.442 --> 35:01.126
something, I'll do $100 worth of testing, and you 
have to do $100 worth of testing. There isn't any

35:01.146 --> 35:02.167
fat. It's just work. Yeah. It's just work. So 
normally, a mature faculty member won't get

35:08.314 --> 35:20.327
involved in too much testing, because he doesn't 
have any way to pay for the graduate students that

35:08.314 --> 35:20.327
he wants to educate. And how do graduate students 
get educated in engineering? By the research

35:23.080 --> 35:24.782
contract that they bring in. There is no other 
mechanism. You're getting paid through some sort

35:26.785 --> 35:32.472
of assistantship, I guess, by the fact you're 
working. That opportunity to do that work was

35:32.492 --> 35:40.141
provided by some faculty member having the 
opportunity to do some research. That's the same

35:41.002 --> 35:45.568
way it works for all 300 or 400 engineering 
students. People get contracts. And they make the

35:47.223 --> 35:50.668
contract read in such a way that they can hire some 
graduate students. That's how they get educated.

35:53.452 --> 35:54.373
But that's the process. And doing the testing 
doesn't add to that process. So yes, there is

35:57.137 --> 35:59.000
testing. And generally what happens is we have 
non-faculty people doing the testing because we

35:59.501 --> 36:10.537
would like to maintain a service level to the 
industry in Texas and keep that connection going.

36:10.637 --> 36:11.318
That's our business. But generally, that's 
occupied. We have the engineering test lab.

36:15.809 --> 36:20.436
Charlie Neely has done that for 30 years, and 
before him, 20 years, other people did it. They

36:20.456 --> 36:21.357
test fans. It's one of the two places in the United 
States where you can test a fan to certify that it

36:22.038 --> 36:28.948
meets certain standards.

36:28.968 --> 36:31.311
That doesn't necessarily have a large 
educational value. They do it at the annex, but the

36:31.371 --> 36:34.375
industry sure loved it. They said, don't go away. 
We need it. So there's 100 or so industries that

36:38.802 --> 36:41.766
deal with Texas A&M. Every year, they say, Texas 
A&M hangs a moon. They do this work for us. But it's a

36:47.234 --> 36:49.036
low-level activity. It's self-supporting. 
Self-supporting activity? Fine. It's not

36:52.280 --> 36:52.820
costly. Yeah, right. And a lot of goodwill. And 
there's other activities. About half of the work

36:56.484 --> 37:00.008
that's done in the wind tunnel is in that category. 
And we have some graduate students, some co-ops,

37:00.028 --> 37:06.314
and Oren Nix, who's a non-faculty, but very 
dedicated, bright guy. They do that work. Fine.

37:08.797 --> 37:09.778
The other half of the time, It's research work from 
the faculty in the Department of Aero and ME, et

37:09.978 --> 37:14.124
cetera. I don't know if I've diverged off the 
question, but that is indeed the way it's done. So

37:20.352 --> 37:35.293
testing is done, but it's generally done by 
non-faculty people, because the faculty

37:20.352 --> 37:35.293
understands that there's no great glory in it, and 
there's no good way to get a lot of money in it. I know

37:37.822 --> 37:40.865
the data processing center is now being 
separated. Right, there's another example. Why

37:44.309 --> 37:47.953
was that separated and other services not? Okay, 
let me tell you how that worked.

37:54.039 --> 38:06.192
When TEAS

37:54.039 --> 38:06.192
has certain funds, which are very small, as you 
know, compared to the Our state budget compared to

38:07.370 --> 38:14.901
the system-wide budget is like 180.

38:16.704 --> 38:19.929
We get 180 of the state funds. But the funds that we 
get are fairly flexible. They don't say, you have

38:25.317 --> 38:30.484
to do this piece of testing with it. They just say, 
go make good research happen. So we're in a

38:33.789 --> 38:35.672
position that occasionally, risks can be taken 
with no detrimental effects in terms of

38:36.040 --> 38:42.708
reportability. In 1958, when the question of who 
and how was going to take the risk on this computer

38:44.350 --> 38:55.062
craft, it was only the engineering experiment 
station that stood up and said, gee, maybe we can

38:44.350 --> 38:55.062
help. So for the next 25 years, we helped. The way we 
help, we will start something, but it has to pay for

38:58.005 --> 39:03.752
itself. So we were doing a $6 million a year 
operation to pay for out of research, out of fees

39:05.352 --> 39:19.612
generated by the administrative side, out of fees 
generated by the university to pay for computing

39:05.352 --> 39:19.612
for students. Of course, they weren't paying 
much. They were paying like $200,000 a year out of a

39:21.695 --> 39:25.721
$6 million budget. But the attitude of the faculty 
is always, Just like your chalk is free when you go

39:29.821 --> 39:37.811
in the classroom, just like your paper is in the 
cupboard, computing ought to be free. And we all

39:37.831 --> 39:39.132
know that's impossible. But it is also very 
difficult for a faculty member to come up with hard

39:39.973 --> 39:48.003
cash to pay for his computer. So basically what 
happens, when something gets to be successful to

39:48.023 --> 39:59.136
the point where a large number of faculty feel it is 
part of the daily conduct of their business, they

39:48.023 --> 39:59.136
want the university take it over and make it free to 
them. And that's what they did. Now what the

40:05.861 --> 40:15.536
university might do to make it free to them is they 
take money from somebody else because they only

40:05.861 --> 40:15.536
got so much money. They will maybe take part of your 
operating expenses away from your department or

40:16.638 --> 40:22.947
they'll take away from some other fund. and it 
won't be there, and then they'll make it for you.

40:26.283 --> 40:31.109
Somebody else over here, if they can figure it out, 
should realize he got robbed to make it free. He's

40:31.129 --> 40:31.729
using it, too. Well, of course, he's using it, too, 
but he got robbed more than he's using it. Right.

40:35.954 --> 40:37.976
Okay, so that's what generated it. That's also 
what happened in the cyclotron. The engineering

40:42.220 --> 40:45.104
experimentation started, got it going. Physics 
got heavily involved when it thought it was neat,

40:45.944 --> 40:49.288
but didn't want to pay the fees. So they say, 
university, take this over so it's free. So they

40:54.624 --> 40:55.044
did. So that's our job. That's part of our job, is to 
introduce new technologies into the mainstream.

41:00.593 --> 41:05.139
We keep going up trying to find things like that and 
try to make it successful. And when it's

41:05.680 --> 41:10.447
successful, then the university would say, gee, 
we better have made this free. They'd take it over,

41:10.467 --> 41:12.250
and we'd make something else. It's a great 
process. So it frees up your money. Sure. We don't

41:15.895 --> 41:18.238
want to operate those damn things. They're a drain 
on us. God, I didn't take constant management,

41:19.778 --> 41:22.701
constant problems. I'd love to give that away.

41:28.466 --> 41:34.432
Do you feel the focus of TEAS has changed at all 
since you started here? Since I was a faculty

41:34.452 --> 41:36.274
member? Yeah, I think it has somewhat. I think 
there's been an increased recognition of the role

41:39.877 --> 41:49.026
that the engineering experiment station could 
play in the development of the state. It wasn't so

41:49.327 --> 41:55.333
apparent in the 70s because we were just moving 
along at all. The state economy was just on a roll.

41:59.657 --> 42:05.984
But as the end of the 70s came along, the bloom was 
off the rose a little bit. People began to ask, all

42:07.485 --> 42:18.456
right, when this oil money runs out,

42:07.485 --> 42:18.456
how have we spent that money to do anything lasting 
for the state? And the next thing that came about

42:20.140 --> 42:33.993
was the realization that the industry of the 
future, the main currency of that industry is

42:20.140 --> 42:33.993
going to be knowledge as opposed to hard goods. So 
if you take those two factors, and then the third

42:35.574 --> 42:44.262
factor is the largest investment the state makes 
is education. By far, you see, what we need to do in

42:49.655 --> 43:03.432
order to help this state is to take advantage of the 
investment they make in education to bring

42:49.655 --> 43:03.432
knowledge-based industries, make it possible 
for knowledge-based industries to be in Texas.

43:03.452 --> 43:05.335
And the educational system's already here. 
There's two or three great research universities

43:05.956 --> 43:08.579
and many others. Is there a way to use that resource 
and bring it to bear on the problems of the state to

43:09.380 --> 43:18.852
make it a better place in the future? And that sort 
of thinking went on here. And that's what we're

43:22.469 --> 43:23.430
about. And I think that changed in the late 80s. 
Right. But several reasons for that. It was the

43:30.900 --> 43:34.225
realization that the oil was not forever. It was 
the realization that the industry of the future

43:35.207 --> 43:39.332
was going to be a different kind of animal. We were 
competing in a different kind of way. It wasn't

43:42.156 --> 43:45.701
that you would be next to an iron ore pit. That 
wasn't important. Other things were going to be

43:49.477 --> 43:51.981
important. And the key to it was the educational 
system. And here we were sitting in an educational

43:57.709 --> 44:01.875
system. We needed to mine that education system in 
a way that was useful and productive, not only for

44:01.895 --> 44:09.767
the educational system, but for the state. And 
that's what we're trying to do. One question I've

44:12.562 --> 44:18.250
asked everybody and everybody's pretty well 
answered so far. What do you find is the difference

44:18.270 --> 44:25.280
between high tech

44:18.270 --> 44:25.280
and technology? Did you ask Dr. Porter that 
question? Did he say high tech is the technology

44:27.603 --> 44:30.948
you do in space? No. Is that what you said? That's 
what I said jokingly. That's the tech you do in high

44:36.596 --> 44:38.759
time. Yeah, right. We were quipped about that. No, 
I don't know what high tech is. I think if anything

44:48.088 --> 45:05.314
that we could say, well, one way to look at it is high 
tech is not so much hardware as it is concept

44:48.088 --> 45:05.314
oriented and knowledge oriented. It's not so much 
a

45:05.334 --> 45:11.323
new car or a new buildings, or it's more

45:11.624 --> 45:33.457
things that are involved with intelligence, 
artificial and human intelligence,

45:11.624 --> 45:33.457
and a wristwatch that computes or communicates, 
or somehow, I don't know. I can't really define it

45:33.517 --> 45:35.320
very good. I don't have a good definition for it. 
But I guess I have my own sort of feeling of what I

45:37.263 --> 45:40.888
think is kind of high-tech. Do you think there's a 
difference between pure scientific research and

45:41.543 --> 45:50.944
technologies,

45:41.543 --> 45:50.944
engineering? There's a difference in the people. 
If you were doing this in the College of Science,

45:54.451 --> 46:01.527
you would not be hearing the words or the 
perspective that you're getting.
